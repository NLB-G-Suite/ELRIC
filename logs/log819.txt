Kammerjunk, is that actually how many coins are in the game?
Luigi was origially going to be a playable character, but he was scrapped for memory reasons
Phase4: I have absolutely no clue, but probably not.

Tangled is still my favourite Pixar film.
It just looks so great.
Question- If you had to be stuck on an island with one pony, who?
rainbow dash
cause she can fly

and she can get me out of there
Ponyguy: Stuck on an island or just on an island?
Haha
Stuck
oh
?
Kabaka: tangled isnt a pixar movie
Then you need alt-codes
then pinkie pie

Or change your keyboard layout

Oh, tab.
cowvarkian: But no, sorry, Disney.
00,10Queen chrysalis, cause she can be every pony
:(
Personally I say Aj, because she can build shelter
Hah
for example to czech layout, or find it in char map
I have the alt button
Phase4: :D
But it is in red
I just remember Floyd Norman, who was also a Pixar animator and story artist.
@Sumica Good Point
I would say luna/ celestia because they can get me off teh island

Do I just change text color?
Hold down alt
I can choose one pony...
I'm going with Sweedish SPitfire
And randomly bash your keypad
Then release alt

Also fabulous,
For example: ALT-0003
And then pray that you find the ý character somewhere

pillow
:P
No
It's a good song
I wonder what would happen to a mod if that mod stream Bayonetta?
Seriously
0,5here it is again.
0,5What can be used as weapons, but also soothe the distraught?
0,5They start and end wars, whether you like it or not.
belts
No lyrics
Deaths
dead poeple
Finally I got to watch Season 3 premere
as weapons? or as a weapon?
BaconMane: guns
sword
bombs
ass
idk
Don't ask why I didn't watch it
baconmane, your wife?
life suport
BUT FRICK
Dat YouTube.
poison
There was a lot of Gak
Also, Hi peeps.
contract?
well if a dying person is suffering..
I'm guessing it's not their reproductive vajayjays either.
Hate Gak!!!!
0,5The answer is Words
words
UR MOMMA
wow
Oh god :D
that is pretty good
is it words?
Yea, I know, right?
:D wow
Like Words of Power?
One time, when I was little, I ate Gak.
sounds like it could actually be in a game
FUS RO DAH
words of emotion
0,5Words can be hurtful, and they can be soothing.
That's what I told him
and had to go to the hospital
one time when i was little..
kaG kaG kaG
0,5Words are what start conflicts, and usually there is some speech or gathering after a war.
i put gooze in my underwear o.O
You dont get kicked anymore for saying g/\k?
Thus, I will never buy my children Gak
Here's another
https://soundcloud.com/arcdreams/biohazard
or was itthe forbidden g word
one of them..
was gooey
I just got bumped for saying kaG. The hell?!
RaveBrony: I believe they took out the kick script
:P
brother got in trouble
Sorry
:3
cause little me had to put it in my panties for some reason..
"Follow NeoSYN, Alicia Keys, The New Yorker and others on SoundCloud."
lol
BaconMane: You gotta admit tho, Ninjazz, had a good guess :D
totally related
Stop that, BaconMane!!
Lol
Lol.
lel
>:/
i think i put it in there so i could play with it..
He is NeoSYN
0,5lelelelel

08,01hey, i said words!
08,01wait

liek the kids did on tv
08,01maybe i only said it in my head
0,5Words
0,5Wooords
0,5Wuuoorolooords
hello everypony
Gurk Gurk Gurk?
food ready
lol
It's Gak, but derpy. :P
May I say a little critique about the Season 3 premere
Damn it, BaconMane!!!
Women can be used as weapons, they soothe the distraught, and they start and end wars (or arguements) whether you like it or not.
I wonder if someone can get the hammer for saying it enough times.
You're having fun with this, aren't you?
Is the ban list that large?
Let's see
0,5Yus
^
:I
RaveBrony, good logic wasn't it?
What if
Ninjazz: It was :D
Plus that whole Troy thing kinda supported it.
Rave
I dont know why, but im still chuckling over it, haha
And we don't even know it
c:
:P
Oh my god
That
o_ O
Would make total sense
I think King Sombra was disapointing, because I didn't get much character out of him
What was the original ban for?
TranceAddict86
^
Bad design, and no screentime = Bad combo
Yeah, the season three premiere was disappointing overall.
bunnyfufu299, as what everyone else thinks
Sombra was fine for what he was meant to be
and he made a thread about how much he hated her
Must have been a heated argument
They had two full episodes to give him a little umph, but they didn't
There seemed to be an emotional disconnect between the characters and the conflict.
I liked his design. Execution was terrible.
^
Nothing in the season three premiere really gelled.
it's like people were expecting another Discord or something
DarkstylePro11
I don't really remember
he was just pure evil
But the thread was pretty bad I think
Also, his lines were terrible
and SR was just sick of the guy anyways probably :P
CrystalPhoenix: We had three awesome major villains (Nightmare Moon, Discord and Chrysalis) in a row. Sombra felt like a step down.
It's like they couldn't decide whether or not they wanted an evil prescense or someone who was great at dark magic.
"My slaves." and "MMMM Crystal" *slurp*
pretty much
DZX x ViiruZz
bunnyfufu299: at least he Went One man army stylle
Dafuq
style*
That "Mmmm, Crystal" line was accompanied by an awesome "BUENO" face.
And
^ :D
I liked the other villians because of their personality and screentime
DaRKNeZz_GlitcherZ

0,5That's enough riddles today :P
I think that was the most recent one
Good one, btw.
When was that?
Likewise.

0,5Ugh
08,01oppam hangman style.
the thread is somewhere in trash
hmm
0,5No, I wanna play some black ops 2 and then shower and go to the party
Is anyone experienced with multithreading programming?
http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-12742-___.html
Nightmare moon: Jelous, Short-tempered, and awesome
I've done some with Java
I love SR's response
"lol."
Yes
I trashed it before anyone could respond

don't feed the trolls guys

and sport ball chocolate
6 is this purple?
6I started when i was 15 in the dragon realms
nasty stuff
6and yes
choclate rain
texasboykc09 tradition in germany, a calender that starts on the first of december and ends on the 24th, every day there is a very small , or a Part of one big present behind the door, and you gotto open one each day
I'll feed it, and nurture it, and take care of it, and then kill it, and then bury it, and then grow flowers on it, and then pick the flowers, and then put them in a vase, and then fill the vase with water, and then I have a nice decoration.
So I guess most here already opened up gifts?
texasboykc09 usually it's a small piece of schocklate, but when you make one yourself it can be anything
I haven't yet
I haven't
Chocolate calendar nostalgia

6No i have to wait till tommrow
Lil_B, ok like the lego one ashens on youtube is doing
I'm actualöly suprised that this hasn't cought on anywhere else

Bronysith: Wait, you're believer?
Hi Malavolent
Malavolent: i couldnt do it anyways, i dont have the wig dumbby
Bronysith: I guess the people in the church wouldn't get it anyway.
Malavolent: and then i will get lynched or something
Malavolent: cause i live in the south T~T
Bronysith: Yay?
I don't really know how the south is.
Oh I see.

Bronysith: want a couple of SNES games you should try? :D :3
90% of people in my country are atheists, therefore I can'r relate to that feeling.
MadSurge: ive already played the best
so i dont need to
Bronysith: not even Squaresoft RPGs? :D
MadSurge: of course ive played chrono trigger and final fantasy 6
Bronysith: funny you should mention those games, the games I talk about are similar :D
Hey Lil_B, have you got your presents already?
Malavolent yes, but since it was only my Mother, STepfather, Sister and the Fact that I'm already 20 means I didn't get much :P
I hope I get a drawing tablet tomorrow!
Lil_B: Don't worry, you usually don't get much since you're adult. What did you get anyway?

Oh man, now I want one of these too.
I don't like Mint Schocklate usually, but since I was small I loved after-eight, the way the Mint is not in within the Schocklate it'self, but surrounded by it
cachi01 SanlEgend?
SandLegend*
super sand lesbian
legennd
yesh
Lil_B: You mean it's not mint filled but there are little pieces of it mixed with the chocolate?
Malavolent no, it is Min-filled, I ment that it's not the Schicklate itself that tastes like Mint
Hey everypony
Right, so it's the other way around :D
hi Serenity :)
oh :P
Hi Serenity :)
Ohai Serenity :)
Just been watching a bit of Venture Bros.

Hi Everypony /)
hey jamajka000
08,01Malavolent: surely not; we're a community based around illegally streaming copyrighted content...
08,01Malavolent: nope
08,01just once i start earning money at all
Hi jamajka000
08,01but that probably won't be for another 3 or 4 years
08,01Malavolent: postgraduate studies and phd
15 minutes to animaniacs marathon
*Tha game
...
08,01i have a list of software i want to pay for once i can afford it
Stuid keyboard with bad wireless signal.
08,01adobe illustrator, indesign, and photoshop are on there
08,01thouhg maybe not photoshop, actyually
What going on?
Malavolent evething after I get my new PC, which I will finally order within the next 2 Days... but I really wanna talk with someone before that who knows which components fit well together >.<
08,01because i don't really use it
08,01i tend to just use GIMP for everything
Scout thinks medic is a dispenser
VM?
I'm not a Noob in the teamr s of PC Components, buit I have never build one myself >.<
bye bronies I'm going to my grandma's house for dinner
Lil_B: Congrats, I have yet 900 euros to save until I buy a new pc.
Bye kidzrul732 :)
08,01i don't intend on buying a new computer for at least 5 years
I build my computer and it didn't failed for about 4 or 5 years now
08,01i've had this laptop for about 2 years now, and it's perfectly powerful enough
And it still can run MW3 on max graphics
lel mw3
graphics
lel
jamajka000: thats not that impressive...
08,01then again, i don't play games
08,01my next upgrade for my laptop wil probably be an SSD
08,01because that's the main bottleneck in modern computing
jamajka000: come back to me when your computer can play crysis on highest settings and run it at 60 FPS
Bronysith bur doing that with Assasins Creed 3 is? Because it also work
Anypony streaming?
but*
nope
jamajka000: you have to do it with Crysis to test your computers capabilities
08,01Bronysith: my computer runs linux, so it's superior to yours anyway :P
it IS the test right ShizuKlaus ?
well, my current PC if from 2008 , it was avereage at the time, and I now want to be both productive, and want to play games that take a few more rescources, so I gotta pay a lot, but at least uit will be enough for the next 5-7 years hopefully
what is linux good for? mostly business shit?
08,01Bronysith: it's amazing, and i'm convinced that it's going to be the next big pc gaming platform
And programing
Bronysith: Linux and business? I don't think so.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwxTCzmThls
yeah xD I wanna make my PC Windows-Linux Dual-Boot
far over the misty mountains rise,
08,01i use linux as my main OS on my laptop (which is my main computeR)
My computer don't need to be powerfull because i don't use it much for games. I have PS3 and XBOX
08,01i very rarely have to boot into windows or mac os, which i also have installed on it
08,01Malavolent: yup
08,01it's a dual core i5 430m with a GT330m graphics card and 8gb of ram
jamajka000: same here. but im dying for a pc
my computer can play Crysis at 60 FPS on full graphics settings and half life 2 at the same time...yet playing planetside 2 or guild wars 2 makes my computer chug? what the fuck
cachi so do i
i guess you cant really judge it from MMOs
T~T
Bronysith Crysis 1 or 2?
cachi01: at least you're getting one soon, i envy you ;3;
jamajka000: both
Im gonna download and check it on mine'
they're not even that good games, just a graphics check
seeing how powerful your gaming pc is
which i think is bullshit T~T
Im buying new PC after New Year
jamajka000: get it custom built
No sh*t
One of the few rap songs I like. This is Rivers of Blood by The Wu-Tang Clan from the The Man With the Iron Fist soundtrack http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAVQ2zycawo
I have it ordered alerdy
jamajka000: spend 1500$ minimum
Bronysith: quick question: you bought a a brand pc or a custom built?
cachi01: custom silly
of course
Bronystih im from Poland so i don't pay in $ :D
You would buy brand pc in 2012?
Bronysith: oh. cause if i get a custom built apparently its price is higher >.<
HAHAHA
yes
cachi01: yea, but custom built is the way to go for gaming
i knooow
jamajka000 hello neighbor, greeting from germany :)
i just want something that can run everything at atleast 45 fps
Hi
no lag at all
cachi01: yea, like waht though? MMOs?
nope
or just games like fallout?
steam games
cachi01: yea you will be able to do that
and alienwares are pretty >.>
lel
cachi01: get fallout 3 and new vegas on steam when you get your new pc, cause it looks beautiful
So what do you guys like the song I linked?
Hello
Lil_B: You and many others :p
Ohai axadentel :)
cachi01: not to mention they are great games
Bronysith: k. though i already have them on ps3 and xbox lel
Lil_B: And?
the look of a PC is something I completly Ignore, I want a Cheap case that stirdy and let's the Air through nicly
I'm buying Core I5 3330 processor, Asus P8B75-V motherboard, Saphire Radeon HD7850 2048 DDR5 256 bit graphic card, And 16 gb 1333mhz ram
cachi01: well PC version of new vegas is surperior to the console releases, the fallout 3 is pretty much the same though
So. When will the streaming continue?
it is streaming right now
ugh, opened up presents early and as a joke my family got me a MLP toy set...
Besides the pretty fire
Zeus: ...
Zeus: wrong generation?
Zeus: how is that a joke? Old Gens? :D
Bronysith Do you think there are types of games that wouldn't port well to a computer?
Zeus: Don't be mad
no it was really akward though
pyrocatboy: dark souls T~T
Lil_B: Why would you go there if you don't want to?
pyrocatboy: it requires a gamepad to play right
GTA IV is lame on PC
Zeus: Best parents ever :D
I like the gift but not the context
pyrocatboy: Racing games tend to work better on consoles
Unless you have a race wheel
Serenity: they only work if you have a racing wheel
Racing games are NOT to be played on keyboards
Bronysith Another game I think won't do well on computers are the SSX games.
pyrocatboy certain types of Adventure Games , I was thinking about it earlier and came to the conclusion that Zelda wouldn't play welöl on the PC without a Controller
pyrocatboy: or fighting games...unless you have a fightstick
Serenity racing games are also good on pad's
Bronysith: I play GP4 with a Gamecube controller
Malavolent I think her point was that I don't have much/any real life friends that care about me :/
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Custom Ponies #96
jamajka000: doesnt feel right though, racing games are MEANT FOR WHEELS
Zeus: At least it was in god humor. I would be dead if my parents ever found out.
*good
Same
My dad's an SA goon, how do you think I feel?
Lil_B Espicialy the ones with a wheel menu. (ie: Twilight Princess)
Somepony Played FAR CRY 3 i have a problem with one mission
Lil_B: I could count my real life friends I can trust using just the ten fingers I have.
now Twilight princess...was a great zelda game
Sabershy: lols when they walk in on you its really wierd, the next conversation would be very awkward
Lil_B: Doesn't make me any less happy though.
im crying
Bronysith: still in the middle of my playthrough and im loving it
HUG?
Zeus: yea, people give it too much hate
After weeks of plannig
http://i1002.photobucket.com/albums/af150/The_FalconO6/CurrentLogicalPCBuyingGuide/Guide.png im using this guide kandarihu gave to me
otakon !
Zeus: i got a speach and everything once they find out. :D
You too otakon :)
/me back
I'm finally going to fuck around and hack the shit out of Pokemon Emerald
Bronysith: A classic game that everyone should play at least once.
Bronysith: the story is awesome why would people hate it?
oh what is this?
dead chat? or just stuck on my end? anyway I'm getting something to drink
merry xmas otakon =D
/me unwraps the present
Sabershy: i wouldnt say twilight princess is classic
/me finds a tonberry
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NCERdh_-j4 this made me sad ;-;
otakon: wrong box T~T
lol
otakon: it was meant to be a Vita
Snow: gotta love dat sfm
Certainly old enough to be... >_>
Hello otakon !
oh
i think a game should be over 10 years old to be considered classic
6410d? Is that Radeon?
funny you should say that Sith
Serenity Is it just me, or do the Elite Four always seem stronger in the third pokemon game from each generation?
I saw a Vita in a skill machine at the mall
otakon: what? T~T
yeah
It's getting bit late
brb guys
you could win a Vita for 1 dollar if you're skilled enough
otakon: lols, but that cant happen
pyrocatboy: I dunno, I fuck them all, so I'm making them semi hard, but I'm gonna add Johto, like G/S/C had Kanto
otakon: but anyways, hopefully i get it for persona 4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npWDC_ysqUQ
Then the Johto crew will be hard as hell
Bronysith: bon chance
Bronysith I didn't liked Twilight Princess, and I think Benzai got my thaughts states rather well, I liked Skywars Swords though what many people hated :/ anyway, Majoras Mask is still thje best and Link's Awakening my favourite :P
otakon: i really hope persona 4 is as good as everyone says
need something to drink...
Lil_B: of course majoras mask is best
Bronysith: it is, the Vita port is good too
Hey all
otakon: well yea, cause the vita is just a portable playstation 3 with those dual analogs
so much locked potential
Have any of you played the Disgaea games?
the poor thing needs more games T~T
Bronysith: Actually, it's slightly less capable of a PS3
Bronysith: I heard good stuff about it! Less animu than Persona 3 too :D
Though VERY close
you know a game I cant wait for is Watch Dogs
hi
Serenity: probably the best handheld system out there, so much fucking potential
Yep
Zeus: I saw interesting things in that trailer
BUT. It's Sony, they'll fuck it all up.
MadSurge: the animation was terrific and the story looks interesting
Serenity: like planetside 2?
Zeus: also a trailer that consisted of GAMEPLAY? Crazytown!
Yep.
ikr
otakon: also, is metal gear solid 3 on vita?
Zeus: that's why I'm interested on Last of Us too, besides being made by Naughty Dog
Bronysith: hmmm I heard mixed things
MadSurge: heard about that, makes me wish I had a PS3
otakon: cause i still need to play metal gear solid 3
I follow 302 blogs on tumblr.
Bronysith: get the HD collection
Bronysith: seriously great buy for anyone who likes the series
pyrocatboy: jeez
otakon: i can appreciate a movie that has a deep story with great characters, hideo kojima is a genius
wait, no, metal gear solid 3 isnt the movie
Bronysith: lol
I've never liked the MGS series too much
metal gear solid 4 has like hours of cutscenes
MadSurge: you heard of Beyond: Two Souls?
like one is actually 45 minutes long?
what the fuck
it's kind of over hyped bye MGS 4 is a very pretty looking game and plays pretty well
Zeus: :O no
Bronysith: yfw Xenosaga had 1h45 minutes of automated cut scenes... in the first 8 hours of game plya
MadSurge: its made by the people who made Heavy Rain, it looks awesome
Bronysith They might as well call MGS games movies with interactive parts of the game.
MadSurge: beyond, two souls? YES I WANTS IT
/me needs hugs
otakon: difference is, i dont want xenosage
/me hugs aniderp|bestfruitcak
already have so many RPGs to play
Bronysith: decent game though
Zeus: I think I'll pass... Heavy Rain never appealed to me :/
AJ's confirmed parents as dead ;_;
yeah I have to play through L.A. Noire, Game of Thrones, Max Payne 3 and Far Cry 3 still
MadSurge: Yeah i can see that, ima a sucker for story driven games
Parents confirmed* bah you get t
also XCOM technically since I haven't beaten it yet
otakon: dude, i already have another 40 hours of persona 3 to play, not to mention if i have to play through if that true ending is how you say it is with maxing out social links, thats another 50 hours through the new game plus, then i have to play through persona 4 golden, thats another 500 hours of heavy RPGs, goddamnit
lol
SO MUCH GAMING
SO LITTLE TIME
otakon: dat game is really freakin hard
Zeus: I like games with story too, but not one that is a glorified Dragon's Lair :(
i dont need any more JRPGs
twilight_sprinkl|mob: ohai there :3
cause JRPGs are a TIME SUCKER
I STILL NEED A PC
MadSurge: what do you mean?
Bronysith: HELLZ YEAH
I LIKE TO SCREAM TOO
Hai tehlonpon
twilight_sprinkl|mob: part of the "club"? <_<
Bronysith Especially the Disgaea games.
cachi01: same here, and i want a good Gaming pc
;3;
Zeus: pushing buttons to make things happen before something bad happens? It's either that or Suikoden
some one help me my friend jss reffered me to rule 34 and typed mlp in the search engine im gonna die :'(
thelonecubone: go to newegg.com , and get like 1500$ worth of shit

So, what are discussing now?
video gameas
Punkie_Pue: videogames! :$

oh jeez
Chrono trigger is best JRPG
Nice and interesting.
/me got hobbit camrip
Zeus: Metal Slug is awesome :$
that place is messed up
Bronysith no disgaea is
MadSurge: never heard of it is that a action platformer?
Bronysith: that's a wierd way to spell final fantasy
gtg cya
/me pulls a tonberry out of otakon s plot and sends it pyrocatboy s way
lol
pyrocatboy: that's a SRPG, not the same thing
Snow: die
Snow: the recent FF's have been garbage
thats true
but im oldschool
um how are ponies typing in italics?
:P
and WHY didn't I notice a Tonberry in my plot ? O_o?
otakon: not garbage
/me like this
X3RainbowDashX3: /me
otakon: is not garbae, at all
otakon SRPG?
?
thats weird to spell wierd
X3RainbowDashX3: u need to buy a bronystate premium account
/me filling out paper work
otakon: garbage is too good to describe the newest final fantasies
Bronysith: the recent ones, specifically XIII and XIII-2, ESPECIALLY XIII-2
just 49.99 a month
ohhh coolio
Zeus: dude, it's a platform-like shooter with four dudes against an army of soldiers and improbable mechanical monsters :D
cachi01: It cost like 64& a month
pyrocatboy: Strategy RPG
$*
thatnks cachi01 /me slaps
lel
ugh the "canon" ending of FFXIII-2 is stupid
/me slaps
lel newbz
MadSurge: just got a look at it makes me wish I had a gameboy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qycQeSltxnQ otakon this describes the new final fantasies
eeyup
otakon: i still have to finish the game :I
cachi01: don't bother
really don't bother
/me lays down and wishes rainbow dash was with me
Final Fantasy 13 great soundtrack and battle system but it was meh
and really why the fuck all of the sudden is lightning dead
and bla blah
shit happens
Bronysith: it's so bad to see where they sank, after playing two really nice SNES era experimental RPGs made by Squaresoft...
cachi01: bc time skip
otakon: wait, you actually finished the final fantasie 13 games?
In terms of Turn based strategy RPGs like the olf FF tites... I think Mother 3 is the best RPG, well, ok it had rather boring combat and not a special leveling or pgrade Systhem so FFVI or Crono Trigger are , if you consider everything, the best
hm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSoCld6kVKE
chrono trigger is the God OF JRPGs
and Final fantasy 6 >.>
Disgaea=Grinding
Lil_B: I thought the combat was the best part of Mother 3 because debuffers actually mattered
/me looks for somepony
oh Mother!
MadSurge yes, but I actually beat the game even without that :/
Chrono trigger, final fantasy 6, 7, persona 3 and legend of dragoon are my fav RPGs right now
Lil_B: well, in the early part they were necessary :D
MadSurge I love Mother 3 for everything it had to offer, don't get me wrong there :P
Lil_B: I think I already said I hated the story :| sorry if I did
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKgNMiy2p5Q&list=PL1B0FCEF532E3DC85 Animal Alpha: Bundy
Burnout Revenge is best racing game
MadSurge really? awww it was such a nice Story :)
GTA 4 is best racing game
:O pyrocatboy! How long has it been?
MadSurge now wait, I remember your argument! yes, it was REALLY depressing
Mother 3 is depressing
MadSurge has what been?
not as depressing as bioshock, or shadow of the colossus, or evangelion
or super mario brothers
or majoras mask
Bronysith: Bioshock wasnt so depressing in the end
Bronysith wut
Zeus: in the end, IN THE END
Lil_B: it wasn't just that, I thought they wasted characters and some things really came out of nowhere and were pulled put of nowhere
majoras mask is a depressing game yes, would you agree otakon ?
Bronysith: unless you were an evil turd
pyrocatboy: I haven't seen you in a while
Bronysith: you chosed to kill or save the little sisters?
thelonecubone: save of course
aye
yes
Madsurge probably a month or two.
brb making a deposit in the national bank of porcelain
thelonecubone: hahaha, losers that kill the sisters, they miss out on their sweet presents
Bronysith: not depressing but creepy as hell
so whos excited for Bioshock Infinite?
me
http://mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=005197 still fukin awesome
i love earthbound theme so much
Earthbound was awesome! :$
Felguk & Example: Plastic Smile http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmAMfojUe7U&list=PL1B0FCEF532E3DC85
MadSurge: ikr :3
SSX is best snowboarding game.
cachi01: its gonna be the bomb I just hope they maintain the atmosphere the other two had
I just can't decide whats better, Earthbound or Mother 3, they are so similar yet so different, and so legendary good
Zeus: me as well
otakon: would RDR be kind of depressing or just bittersweet?
08,01everyoine
Bronysith: oh depressing for sure
08,01i have found the best tumblr ever
thelonecubone: the whole outside thing gets me kinda worried
08,01http://synthcats.com/

TheGentlemanBrony: lol we're need to start a cult religion based around ponies
no

Zeus I'm a huge fan of your work
new born cuties day
TheGentlemanBrony: you know nothing of his works
you like my grammer error
?
brb getting some bolillo or however u murricans call it
Zeus: no he meant as the diety
oh yeah dude i fuck shit up
Does anyone else think EA games did well in making SSX 2012? Awesome Graphics Awesome Soundtrack Awesome EVERYTHING
im a real prick in God of War though
Zeus: can I be on the RastaPierians? :D
god of war is overrated
still fun
lots of fun
I wish I had more time to play video games.
and is still overral, a great game
and wasn't so lazy.
Hey
Hey
so its overrated but its good?
actually, come to think of it, it isnt actually overrated
Aww
Is anypony else getting lag?
Zeus: hahahahahah, you think overrated means bad
pyrocatboy: ikr
okay thats more reasonable
SSX was awesome
Or is it just my shitty connection?
Zeus: Overrated = bad?
Zeus: overrated =/=bad dumby
Cus my connection truly is awful
NOT WHAT I MEANT
YoGuys!
Zeus: yes you did
I'm back online

WHen you get in-game, it runs at like 7 FPS
Not really
I lost 100 FPS when I went in-game
Works for me perfectly fine
SOCOM 2 does?
Never tried it
I read it with Engineer voice
What version do you have?

Just thought I'd share..
cachi01 Swollen Members: Deep End http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N31THPMBOy4&list=PL1B0FCEF532E3DC85

Hmm
why would an IRC client ever need that feature?
its unique to this irc client I think
/say /say
I dunno.
seems kind of useless
how are you gonna contact someone if u haven't got any coins on you or are far away?
maybe if someone asks what your running
So
Unless you want to brag about your computer to a bunch of nerds
Like when I asked Meth what his graphics card was?
kimplix: No need, haven't needed it for the past 8 years
yes
lol
uhmm if u are far away then u will have no signal
Yes
:3 Drat! I cant find that bacon jingle - consider yourselves lucky, I'll remember it next year! :D
actuley, don't answer that
yeah
like that
or how much ram you have
I needs more ram.
I got 8GB
bacon jingle?
But impossible to upgrade.
yeah -- lol
I probably have the least RAM of anyone here
1 GB
beat that
i am the bacon man bring all the pork i can to all the little kids down the road
:P
How
How do you run anything
clogging their arteries with all my msgs then they all die at the age of 6
8
ancient netbook
I like the fact I have 3 weeks of uptime
lol
lol
which is rare of this laptop.
for*
some meat company, whos name I cant remember, has a bacon jingle that goes "Give us some crispy bacon"
It usually crashes all the time and messes up.
lol
lol
brb
I was going to take it back if it crashed one more time, but I guess that was 3 weeks ago...
lol
i'd say turkey
is the evil dead trilogy good?
It's like a kid playing hookie
Pretends to be sick all the time
Meth can only say lol
Seriously though
lol
But when you say you'll bring him to the Doctor he gets out of bed and hauls himself, books and all
haha
I'll bet over half of the messages you've sent in this channel have been "lol"
you forgot
:D
or something asking for dating advice.
lol
that's another 25%
or Spyro
Spyro sucks
SR, i bet 1/2 of ur messages is MLP
Or his friend's girlfriend
Ohhhh yeah
Anyone care for a joke?
better split that 50% "lol" in half for that
lol
Sooo...we've been watching fire for like an hour now.
then then another 20% is lying about some useless crap
hahaha
20% trying to be a big shot.
I'll take that as a needed yes
And another chunk is the phrase "so..."
wait, some of these probably overlap
What's green and stands in the corner?
He tries to be a bigshot while lying about stuff
a tree?
Bronysith it was awesom!
He talks 180% of the time
and while talking about his friend's girlfriend
hello
We have the correct percentages
2 part and third mostly
I mean the categories smartass
Not the percentages
:P
hi bluemane
Ouch
hi kimplix
ouo: you mean army of darkness?
yes
it's a joke
mostly
:)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_d4I_VYDj8
best
20% a joke, 80% true.
fuking
line ever
Then I am 20% okay with this
lol
okay now I want to write a script
Meth's "lol" count
I know
lol
ROFL
but I don't know any IRC scripting
no
I need the chat log for the past 2 weeks
lol
THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK is the best line ever
Don't need it. Just throw it through grep
thats too
hell really ALL of Campbell's line in that are the best lines ever
You don't wan copies of my chatlogs.
lol
agreed
also
lol
i know
Do you keep logs?
yes
otakon: should i just skip to army of darkness? or would i not know whats going on?
I have logs on my laptop and at home.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS6BX-gcJqw
I want a chat log from the past few days
refernce to army of darkness
Bronysith: you can safely watch it without wastching the first two
That guy who just sits and lurks in the chat.
otakon: good, cause it looks fun
Hey dari
otakon: Did somebody say Campbell?
Hey
yes
I did
Im wearing my pony shirt at work.
/me badass.
otakon: i like his cameo in megas xlr
OH COME ON
haha
BerryPunch, /)
/me is not.
Bronysith: as Magnanimous? yeah
INB4 you get assaulted on the way home. :P
/me carries Phase4 into bed
hahaha
Although I've heard everyone in Canada is really nice, maybe not.
otakon: where can i find it? i want to watch it
I don't walk home.
Bronysith: no idea
good evening guys
T~T
Lawl
what was that
I would be doing the assulting.
/me suplexes Alchemist rock lee style
Hey
Do you have Chat logs?
Yep
We want to find out how much Meth has said 'lol'
Can you send em?
hi Bronysith :)
Send them how? I could pastebin them
the headache
Sure
dont pastebin them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuEzVfWXk20 best scene ever
/me suplexes ouo
and I'll enjoy it :D
jsut zip them and upload somewhere or dropbox them
if you pastebin them they are public.
lol
Yea, they're probably too long for pastebin
You can put them unlisted
It will ruin my chances of becomming a crooked politician.
otakon: are all 3 of the evil dead movies good though?
Hahahaha
Gotta go to bed early today, I'll go visit my relatives tomorrow and have an Xmas feast! See you tomorrow! :)
Bronysith: yeah for the most part
You already got my vote
Bronysith yes!
Excellent.
Or I could just find out how many times Methisbad has said 'lol' for you. :P
/me mr burns
well the first one is on netflix, ill have to watch it
lol
that would be great
I went by 50 names though
the second one is basically a remake of the first really
Then someone will need to make a script counting all future lols
grep this: "Meth: lol"
z.z
troutslap for every lol.
also it was scene from the second one
Why are yhou all here?
=P
Just look up LOL, I used many names
I used BillGates, Afflice[Vita], HughHeftner
rainbow troutslap for every rofl
evil dead my faforite movie about zombies
Vordox: cause my dad is working and my brothers are out drinking
it just fucking epic
Vordox: and then my mom and i are going to visit the dad at the work
Jokes on you, I would never buy a play station vita.
And various things starting with Meth
and everyone here knows it.
Busy busy.^^
and Afflict_is_gay
I didn't know that
otakon: but people only really talk about army of darkness
Me neither
yeah
You need to pay closer attention.
To the things I hate.
I know I do
you've never said that
cause its the best one?
that was the standout one due to bigger budget
You should know I hate consoles
and it was way over the top
and you liked the PSP
so good?
for B movies?
pffft that was like 6 years ago.
and you made fun of me for not being able to afford a DS
meanie
it's still kind trash movie
I did no such thing,
and old
lol
you totally did
it's perfect for B
i think
I want the new DS
I made fun of your parents for not being able to afford to buy you a ds.
lol
but again, it was like 6 years ago
Just kidding of course.
so don't bite my head off.
Probably more than 6 years
I don't do that anymore
Good because I only have so many heads left.
and I don't want to go out and get more.
/me jumps from a really tall building into chat and dies from the fall
I'm not a teenage girl
So I'm capable of taking a joke

Oooh, wicked lasers?
meh, adventure time T~T

SantaNoobs: epic on the laser XD
500mW is enough to burn through paper
i cant wait for my luna plushie to arrive, made by bronystates own taoumi
/me is a physicist and knows that well ^_^
lel im wearing an adventure time shirt right now
MakerDusk: I know, it is very bright though, and my parents will not let me shine it anywhere outside... but for a good reason: safety
I'm wearing a regular T under a Red 20% cooler hoodie
they're banned in the states because they keep on dropping planes >_<
:D
If you shine them in the sky directly at planes
it should have a visible beam though
Did I miss more spamming again >.>
so that's epic :D
500mW can be seen perfectly in daylight, at night, it is so bright that you have to cover your eyes
MakerDusk: It burns through paper
Hi guys
aww such a horny creature
SantaNoobs: once again, I know: I'm a physicist

SantaNoobs: pics pls
you should wear it
otakon: watch the vid
cachi01: It is in the bin, sorry
I don't wanna have to dig it out
But it looks funny, just a big burnt hole through the case and through the DVD.
I killed them with fire
SantaNoobs: but minty is love
Unnr: Minty is the best of the G3 ponies (I have to admit), but still in the creation of the ugly G3 design... if she were recreated as a G4 and not as stupid, it would be awesome.
But.. minty...T_T
why g3 ponies wear socks and g4 doesn't ;_;
Everyone has different opinions.
Internet will die
ouo: The makers would allow them to wear socks, because of le internets
I will make sure it happens!

Yay, FiM won every single one of the Naughty Or Nice Award categories. Bronies.
SantaNoobs: are you surprised?
No
ouo: Sorry, I can't get myself to watch it. G3
chrysallis is overrated
Socks keep the yule cat from eating you
Bronysith: Say that to Unfound :p
otakon: No, I am just happy that bronies always beat little children at their own game, lol.
SantaNoobs: .... that doesn't sound right
Little kids would have thought some other character from some other show should have won, but if it is open to the internet, MLP is going to win.
why is there only a fireplace?
SantaNoobs: yes. Teenagers and grown men beat children. Thats certainly something to be proud of
SantaNoobs: MLP only won two categories. MAybe three.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=4Sl_D3Wx1sQ#t=1007s
But really, The Crystal Empire was good, but the reason everyone says it was so bad was that they knew how awesome it could have been. They could have either gone the "entertain people" route, or the "advertise crystal pony" route.
ponies made of diamonds
Here you go

Are you sure you're really 14?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyZV0PmZVw
I'm not ruling that out yet :p
A pony is a small horse[1][2][3] (Equus ferus caballus). Depending on context, a pony may be a horse that is under an approximate or exact height at the withers, or a small horse with a specific conformation and temperament. There are many different breeds. Compared to other horses, ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails and overall coat, as well as proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, thicker necks, and shorter heads with broader

with the best buy gift cards and some of the money I bought myself 2 new monitors for my computer
I'll get tran-siberian orchestra for ya Reikim
Nah, need original
Much as I love the TSO.
13finally...
13turns out it's hard to move the spawnpoint of a server without bukkit
ShizuKlaus: lelel
> Server
I don't care what you say Bill is best pony!
> No Bukkit
What happened
Bukkit is dead :(
What horrible happenings occurred?
What the hell
Isn't Essentials still updated for the latest version?
jcelios but ... but i wub ponies in The Hobbit
they warm and fuzzy c:
gather around and let me tell you the story of Bill
Hi everpony, why's the chatroom's white?
Bill was described as being old, weak, and sickly.
i got my wii u who has teh u in wii
*everypony
During Bill's stay with The Fellowship in the city of Rivendell, it was observed that his once poor health had improved.
http://i.imgur.com/7f7l9.png
how are things VenHur i don't know is it something with your client?
When the creature of the lake (Watcher in the Water) attacked, Bill fled in fear. Sam, who cared for him greatly and had grown attached to him, thought him to be dead, and grieved.
I'm not sure.
:'(
On their way home, however, they found he had returned safely to Bree. Bill played a small part in the winning of the Battle of Bywater by kicking his former master, Bill Ferny, in the backside, and thereby freeing the Shire from further entanglements from the foul man.
The End
yay!
...
So seriously what happened to Bukkit?
sounds like bill was a smart pony
why the hell they can't find actually pony for this role
those ponies need a hair cut, ouo
13Reikim: FTB mods require Forge, Forge can't have bukkit
Mm, hold on
the_real_pony_1604 i like zem :3 Think mlp need more furr on ponies
I used to run Forge.
also just thought
as I understand it Forge is going to try to replace parts of Bukkit
It's been a while though...can't you use Essentials with Forge?
or rather incorperate them into Forge
aren't most of the mods in FTB the same as tekkit? because thats a bukket server
Also I'm fairly certain I used to have Bukkit, or parts of Bukkit, with Forge.
yeah they used to be seperate things
and were compatible
is Twi have a razor to remove growing furr?
I'm not sure why the Bukkit team abadoned the project
why some ponies are fuzzy and some are skinny
I heard rrumors they were working for mojang now?
minecraft fairly recently dropped the whole seperate code base for singlerplayer and multiplayer thing also
probably related
I am asking, was I just doing something inappropriate? I left this unlocked, and my brother could have gotten on. If I did anything, I am sorry.
I'll scroll up and see
you spammed the N-word 999999999999 times

Whats up, BronnyState?
*Bronystate
jcelios: Dayum, sorry bout that. :( That was my brother.
How long ago?
KrazyNoobs: I was kidding actually :$
jcelios: Good, so my brother did nothing. :)
KrazyNoobs: far as I can tell nothing happened
13Reikim: there's a Forge Essentials mod that imports most of the Essentials stuff (except setting server spawn) and WorldEdit(yaaaay)
brb
http://horsebreedslist.com/horse_breed_images/84/big/shetland-pony-picture-6.jpg
ponies are cute :3
jcelios: Good, for a second while I was going to the store, I thought my brother would have gotten on and got be banned. He didn't, so it's all good. :)
13Bukkit's also basically giving the finger to devs trying to bridge compatibility between Forge and Bukkit so all the mod devs are moving to Forge and FTB
I watch this fire all day, everyday day
ouo: these things are cute to be real!
all day everyday
all day, everday
all day, everyday
etc
I'm going to TF2. bye for now

Hi ShizuKlaus, so you changed the layout of the chatroom from black to white?

Sometimes I feel I am the only person who Tiny Toons is the favorite of
Isn't Animaniacs on right now Sumica?
00,10wakkos wish
Wakko's Wish is okay, not as good as the series
When I was young, I thought Tiny Toons was a cheap rip-off of Looney Toons, until I learned it is just a tip of the hat to the fans of Looney Toons... is that right?
00,10yep
Sumica: I never had too much luck with stealth, or pickpocketing, or lockpicking...

How DARE you!
oh god, so much great animation
00,10blew his mind
nothing does.... this show is so dirty
Bronysith: Maybe he's talking about SatAM Robotnik
oh lovely
J_E_Smith71: ahh, you mean the only good sonic show?
XD
Here we go agian
I'm talking about ALMOST every version, J_E_Smith71. With the exception of the AoStH version, who was frankly idiotic.
Babies on planes. >:(
And SatAM wasn't that good. Robotnik's stellar voice acting made a difference for it though.
Bronysith: Yeah the one where Robotnik wasn't a goof
Jim Cummings, for that version, if memory serves.
Lasharus: in the 3d sonic games, he is pure annoying
I disagree.
I hate it when, for no reason, all the babies on a plane start crying.
He is fantastic in Sonic Generations, I liked his style in Sonic Adventure 1 and 2.
Sonic 2006 should be shot and burned, admittedly.
Lasharus: you do realize its the fans fault that game sucks right?
No.
I like Robotnik in Adventure and Adventure 2, they were going somewhere with the character then stopped
you guys are never satisfied =_=
Oh please.
Have you SEEN Sonic 2006?
oh
I've never been on a plane so I wouldn't know how to feels to be trapped on one with a crying baby.
Oh god
And most of us are satisfied with Sonic Generations.
:)
Ooooooooooh
Lasharus: the game was meant to come out in the 18th anniversary, you sonic tards demanded it be released for the 15h
'you sonic tards' - thanks for that.
Lasharus: therefore it was rushed
Sumica: <3
Why announce it if it was coming out in 4 years?
Sumica: mark hamil is best joker
Even if it weren't rushed, there were so many appalling design choices, it was doomed from the bloody outset.
mitamaking: duke nukem forever
Have you even SEEN that storyline?
Bronysith: That game stunk too
mitamaking: exactly
And he will magically land without a scratch
Rushing I'm willing to grant being the fault of the fanbase.
Lasharus: arent most sonic fans furries?
The horrible design choices, I will not.
I'm watching I's a Wonderful Life right now myself
Why do I get the impression you're just trolling me now?
besides diehard of course J_E_Smith71
Bronysith: As a My Little Pony fan I find that attitude insulting
With all due respect, I dislike parts of the Sonic fanbase for being overzealous, but those kinds of generalisations are tiresome.
J_E_Smith71: My dad is too
08,01by and large, most furries are bi, and large.
Sorry Batman, people are nice
What Lasharus said. I don't dislike the Sonic fandom, I just dislike the people who are overzealous about it.
Just... thanks.
I think I'll be leaving.
Its a wonderful life is a great story for sure
00,10pffff, wonderfull life being chearful.
Now when my parents ask me what I learned, I could say that furries are bi and large. Thanks, Satturn

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Convention Compilation - December 24th
Bronysith: well arnt you a scrooge?
NYC_Brony: hope you enjoy lots of messy food and love your family
whoever is streaming YOU PINKIE PROMISED!
like
ever
When do you open gifts, i will open mine on midnight
Bronysith: tis a joke that only I can get :P
Bat joke is bad
:L
Bronysith: because why feed the troll when you can laugh at him?
I love this part
Major: then why the fuck would you tell a joke that no one else in the world but you can get?
so that the halls are filled with only your laughter and you look like a complete idiot
Bronysith: someone's being naughty
open it
Bronysith because it's funny. The world's greatest comedian always did jokes that only he was on.
Andy Kaufman
Major: yes i am browsing clop right now, but thats besides the point
There is a lot of people in my house trying to type stuff on my laptop
oh joker you so....joker
NYC_Brony LEAVE HIM ALONE!
too bad mark hamill is done with the batman games

Who the fuck left a roller skate there?
Bronysith: He said that after the first one
whoa
NYEH
DerpyMuffins: Someone who hates the Joker
WELL
Welp that was fun
THAT HAPPENED TO ME
Thanks for that short stream Sumica
Thanks Sumi
BUT.. THAT WAS FROM WORKKING WALMART FOR ONE SEASON
oos
sorry for the caps
though recieving is pretty fun too
DerpyMuffins: That's easy enough to say, but you do want something
black friday is/was hell
http://i.imgur.com/hHrlo.jpg hahahahahha,
KrazyNoobs: Really? While I celebrate neither, I think things like Valentine's Day or Father's/Mother's Day are worse.
brony... heheh
08,01DerpyMuffins: okay, i phrased that wrong; i didn't stop celebrating it because i didn't receive anything. i stopped celebrating it because upon analysing what happened that year, i realised that it was somethign that i didn't want to be celebrating
hmm hmm
Needs more yulelogs
Where is my yulelog?
Is that Sumica? Are you switching back to the fireplace?
Capitalism don't you love it?
nyeh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=KnG5f9trnmo
Yep
Refresh to go back to the fireplace
I do appreciate capitalism, it means we live in a free society
http://i.imgur.com/jweHu.jpg
Bronysith: oh so thats what you do for a living....
Funny, considering Jesus was born in March
Major: huh?
It's the Wii's biggest hit
08,01i'm not religious, i can't afford gifts for everyone i want to give them to, and i don't like receiving gifts, i don't particularly like spending time with my family
00,10one out of 4 is not bad I guess then.
i for one, do not appreciate capitalism, because that means that corporations are calling the shots, and that usually doesnt mean whats good for the people
but enough of politics :)
I like recieving gifts, I will not apologize for that
00,10dose the big meal count if you are makeing it for some one else?
08,01well, i'll use any excuse to cook a roast
Sumica: Do you still eat it?
00,10no
then no
Bronysith: oh nothing, just go back to cloping infront of your roomate
00,10oh then 0 out of 4
Sorry Sumica
Major: hell yea, clopping in front of roomates is fun, especially when they join in on the fun
then it just becomes lots and lots of mess
everywhere~
08,01i hate the religious aspect, the commercialism aspect, and the family aspect
Bronysith Are you not treading thin ice good sir?
That... escalated... quickly...
Bronysith: and thats just disjusting....like you....
08,01J_E_Smith71: i also hate TV
Major: never said i was clean
Wait, wait, wait. People still watch TV?
Kammerjunk: baffles me
Bronysith: ah so you do live in a dumpster....
Vests, maybe.
08,01mitamaking: i like people
08,01(most of the time)
08,01and i like sex
08,01but that's not a topic for in here
Major: with access to the internet and hot food delivered daily, and my ps3, xbox 360 iphone and gaming pc,
indeed
Bronysith: so thats why you never get any chicks.....
08,01the thought that i sohuldn't talk about it in here came after the thought that i should mention it
08,01it was kind of a backpedal
Bronysith: It's a nice dumpster
Major: Straight? ewww
mitamaking: hell yea, you want in?
Bronysith: guys then
What did I miss?
http://vimeo.com/19815736 I've never seen this before :O That animations is so cool
Major: guys? ewwww
Bronysith: How fast is your internet?
Bronysith: ponies?
08,01Major and Bronysith, can you take your argument elsewhere please?
http://i.imgur.com/RAHLa.png
08,01Bronysith: that is ADORABLE

Oh.
Heh Tolkein Calvin & Hobbes style
Well, that's alright then.
Bronysith wouldn't it just be romantic for her and not you??
I made Calvin and Hobbes comics on a site called Pixton
TheGentlemanBrony: I'll tell ya, but it's nothing mindblowing.
08,01i'm sure molestia can be romantic
TheGentlemanBrony: you can make it romantic if you dont resist and actually enjoy it
08,01just romantic + sex
TheGentlemanBrony: ...It's a food accessory for a Danish dish.
08,01the two can coesxist, you know
That actually iss pretty interesting
I first read it as Katzenjammer and I immediately thought of Kyuss.
It's not rape if you enjoy it
Hi guys :)

DerpyMuffins: Do you live in Minnesota?

TheGentlemanBrony Nope
I was right, holy crap
I only know about CSI because Justin Biever died on it
I don't like CSI because if I want to watch a cop show, I'll put on any one of the other cop shows with the exact same plot and the exact same characters.
DerpyMuffins, now i have seen that one

The J.E. Smith was not looking at chat you see, he was watching It's a Wonderful Life on TV

This is one of the reasons Denmark isn't an optimal place to live.

About welove's prices
But hey, free health care and clouded skies all year.
Kammerjunk This year has been just rain rain rain rain rain
and did i forget to mention?
rain
Who needs the sun?

killerpony7733: Not true. We got like 4 days of snow.

And that's 4 days too many.
And to be honest, I kind of like the rain as long as I have my jacket.
here in the east we just got 2 days of snow and that was in october
http://i.imgur.com/vChZQ.png
I hate the winter, summer and most of the spring.
Kammerjunk Yes we got snow for what like that amount of days? else it's been rain and only rain so much. Even rain made the snow go away
wat do you love
You know what I don't hate?
I don't hate vests.
Kammerjunk So i'm guessing your name is francis then?
I don't hate like half of autumn.

owwie what was that for?
He's real, See http://i.imgur.com/o0R44.gif
aniderp|bestfruitcak: Sleep O-O
but why?
Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve.
Go to bread aniderp|bestfruitcak, Santa will come .-.
aniderp|bestfruitcak: sleep is for the weak!
thelonecubone: he's real... drunk
fine...

MakerDusk, lol. Yes. :D
Big_Macintosh_1992 is best poneh... if he could draw, write music, or notice details like a yellow octavia

But in seriousness, it probably will be MakerDusk. >_>
Would u buy it while going yay?

TABITHA ST. GERMAIN Y U SO RECLUSIVE?!

Hey MakerDusk I know what Tom does but what do the other Mane 6 Bots do?

And it feeds on IQ. :O
These ghosts rock.

Lawls.
Le Gasp! Dun Dun Dunnnn
MakerDusk, you doing that or is kabaka?
/me is scared
PonyChat scares me :(
"send messages through the bot itself" ". This has been removed on SwiftIRC because" " causing channel owners to be fooled into thinking the bot was a threat and getting their channel taken over or stolen." wat...
Phase4: me
it's not programmed to autorespond yet
/me slaps MakerDusk around a bit with a large trout
/me also slaps MakerDusk around a bit with a large trout
Phase4: that's also annoying since I'm drunk and had to use TS6

In hopes that little woona soon would be there.

The bronies were sitting their monitors aglow
Why are you suffering cachi01|suffering? .-.
SantaTheDuck: family games

with hopes that Hasbro would keep with the show
Unnr: monitor glow is epic :D

the fireplace roared softly while many counted sheep
for studying science
Unnr: meepsheep? where?!!

When there in the room arouse such a clatter
The bronies looked quietly, to see what was the matter
*arose
Well i am bored

OHH myyy...

SOO BORED *scoot scoot

Phase4: right now, I'd probably just voice myself XD
Away to EQD they went like a flash
wait... then I need 2 overrides... I'd op myself so it could later be taken away without an override XD
but the blog it was silent, nare´ a pick of swag ´stache
The moon tho´ aglow was bare in the sky
if they're going to Sir Dragonstuffer's Slaphouse of Long Faced Pleasures then they don't deserve any gifts in the first place

The glorious driver, mane glowing like day
PonyChat: sure

More rapid than pinkie the chat the chat came alive
You know the rules and so do iiiiiii
Phase4: I can't even do that :s
Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down
They should make ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°) into the Pinkie G3 Face, that way, people would stop using it
:D
Happy Hearth's Warming Eve everypony :)

cachi01: the cake is a lie
¨Now! Rariry, now! AJ, now, Spike and Twily!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Phase4: great idea
but then how would I learn TS6?
but you can have Flan :3
YAY
and tamales :3
/me googles TS6
brb
Out, Fluttershy, out! Rainbow, out! Gummie and Pinkie!¨
I need to go and look up if Le Lenny Face, which is ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°), has any inappropriate meaning that would get me banned for using it, brb
Through the chat room they came, breaking the fourth wall
It is best to know about things before you use them,
It's just a plague.
Yep, it originated by 4chan, I'm not liking it thus far
I know they always use it
The bronies, to a man, faint they did all.
It was flooded on NEWS pages revolving the Israeli Airstrike... nothing that bad, so, uh... ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°)
Of course, people do find it annoying, so to avoid conflict, I'll minimally use it
as concious they came, to see pegasuses fly,
That awkward moment when 50% of all comments thus far are owned by you. I need to quiet down a little bit
its called le Lenny face
also known as
( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°)
The israeli face
this night, the awesome, brought tears to the eye
cachi01|ZahmbieU: orly?
KrazyNoobs: I'm the most active person on the network by far
I love that fire.
I knew it as the Lel face. You got banned on /b/ for usig it.
so I can't say anything there
the amount I've spoken is measured in GB XD
MakerDusk: There is no "most active person", you just analyse the last 10 comments and find out how many of them you posted.
You have very expensice conversations, Dusky.
expensive*
Ninjazz: expensive how?
other than the network fees
SO into the channel, Pinkie she came
y'all should donate one of these days XD
Giggling and gasping, enjoying her fame
ponychat accepts donations?
we've gotten one donation in the entirety of the network's life XD
Phase4: of course
we have 10 servers
XD
MakerDusk, oh wait. The amount you've "spoken". I thuoght you said when you speak it costs GBs. I only have 150 gbs in this netbook so... that's sounds very expensive.
Le Lenny Face is best face [14:49:12] < ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°)
if the website would load i'd try make that 2
And then with a fanfair Celestia set out her hoof
while there in her shadow, stood Luna, aloof.
(eep, bio calls)
MakerDusk, yay donations!
Phase4: are you saying cadence is down:O
MakerDusk, no, my phone is just bleh
Phase4: you donated?!!
that i did
I am going to enjoy my new present more, biyee
KrazyNoobs: don't burn down the whole neighbourhood XD
Phase4: midget is going to die of shock XD
pulling 35MB over hsdpa
XD
MakerDusk: I also got a trampoline.
KrazyNoobs: laser and trampoline... add some alcohol and have some fun XD
MakerDusk: But yes, when I use my new 500mW Green, I will be sure not to burn down too much of the neighbourhood.
MakerDusk: :)
Now due to insufficent funds, my dad or anyone else in my family couldn't gived me a present, which is a shame. I really wanted a Wii U...
VenHur: Sorry bout that, bro
Well, I'm off
Le Lenny Face is best face [14:48:32] ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°)
this year I opted not to give my family presents
But on the bright side, It could allowance COULD be enough for a video game.
haven't gotten anything from them in 8 years anyways
unless you count coal one year
i can't buy presents :(
(annnd back, where was I...)
I'm thinking of Assassin's Creed, Infamous, or any other famous PS3 titles.
(Ah yes)
honestly cant figure what to get people
Phase4: monitors
there is no such thing as too many of those XD
Phase4: you can buy me a laptop :3
Between them, there floated a rather large pack
Major1, i no has enough money to buy laptop :(
Phase4: then can you buy me AC3? :(
And from it came presents, as did one... Big Mac
Major1, but... money D:
Phase4: don't worry: if the proof of concept goes well, me and midget are totally cutting #geek in XD
RACIST BARN RACIST BARN 1 2 3 4
Their eyes, they did twilkled, the Pinkie how merry
http://www.livestream.com/feedbacklounge2 mic is giving out prizes for correct answers to questions
: D
err... I drunk
ouo, i heard rasin barn
there is no proof of concept that generates a min of 50k a year
as bronies did feast on warm chimi-cherrys
>_>
<_<
kully6745, i belive that is stream advertising which is against our rules
kully6745 Read the rules here.
seems legit
Phase4: at all?
also i have a shiny new @
´til Celestia did speak, coat white as fresh snow
thanking those, one and all, for beleiving in the show
Dat Phase4 with a @ O.O
Looks good on you, Phase4 :)
http://www.livestream.com/feedbacklounge2
So that means Phase4's an admin?
but morning did strike and the ponies, they rose
and anothe advertisment
another*
is k, kicked him
cool
VenHur, indeed
Actually, I just noticed that Phase got promoted.
hopefully he gets the message
Lets see if he learns
i don't yet know how to ban
/me pats Phase4 on the head and gives him a cookie
What took so long, Phase?
and if he forces me to read documentation then i'ma permban
Ninjazz, lazy
Know that feel.
Congratulations for achieving admin status, Phase4, now the question is, What will you will streams?
VenHur, uh... ponies?
Phase4, ewwwww
Phase4: Fair enough. XD
pone
Why do you stream ponies, they're so gay
So Phase4 is a mod now? O.O
Horses are forbidden
Hasn't phase been a mod for a while now?
back into carrage, with faces of woe
Guys, what's your favorite version of Fly me to the moon?
Drew: more like tech guy
Presents47, i am mod now
he just got promoted not too long ago
Phase4: wats with BerryPunch?
Drew, i was tech, worked on the site
jcelios, BerryPunch is a bot
yeah but
wat do
does spamkicks, plan to have it do more complex chanel managment in the future
I see
http://static.quickmeme.com/media/social/qm.gif
Phase4: Congrats. Can I have your old place? \:3/
let me guess presents47 is a bronystate veteran that hasn't come here for a while right?
Don't give it to him
I thought Tom did spam kicks?
I've only been here for 4 weeks
give it to me
Phase4 is now clarified as a modderator. Modderators get to streams thier choice of picks.
I have a name with no numbers
it's a fresh start
CrystalPhoenix: Nope. I'm Ponies47 :p
http://static.quickmeme.com/media/social/qm.gif
See :3
Away they all flew, to the flash of a rainboom
guess it's not gonna work
Hey, your ain't the only one.
VenHur, i get to who with the what now?
and the chat it was quiet, more so than a tomb
Ponies47, XD

/me hugs Luna

and the back light
Buytoast: then why not the original DS?
WOAH
well since a lot of kicks come from youtube vids during stream, you could add something like :youtubeOn :youtubeoff and make the kick script look for youtube.com
I just click on something weird on steam
because the 3DS plays DS games
but not game boy games
Sucks that the newer DS models doesn't had GBA slots.
When is the wedding Luna?
/me 07,01hugs everypony that wants a hug
But the first gen DS plays GBA games
Luna: <3
i know
which is awesome
but i already have a 3DS
Ahhh
i dont need another one
like the gak one
/me hugs Luna
/me hugs Luna back :P
8,05Luna: cheers!!! *chugs some whiskey in Luna's honour*
07,01within 24 months it will be relatively small... with my condition we do need to change a few things.
MakerDusk: Here Here!
8,05and yes, I read the blog XD
/me offers MakerDusk some more scotch.
Mainly because on the 3DS/XL Virtual Console, you get to DOWNLOAD the handheld games of earlier handhelds.
07,01will dedicate a blogpost to it tomorrow
then streamers wouldn't have to be giving warning during streams for that
07,01but since you have me on fb.. you can see the gift ;)
Apple cider, anypony?
never touched the virtual 3DS thing
Luna: yay~
Are we on the guest list Luna?
/me 8,05hugs a Luna and tries to remember his facebook password XD

07,01thanks :)
oops wrong channel
Luna, Woah, thats a nice pendant
it's not acceptable to call me a fag
07,01thank you :) just wanted to share my feelings with you all
/me slaps SantaTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
/me licks Jmo :3
feelings are best shared with others if they are of the positive type Luna
8,05all the present PonyChat admins send their congratulations as well, Luna ^)^
You love using your colours today, don't you?
i should try kick MakerDusk as he is technically breaking the rules, though that would probably be a pointless endeavour
'try'
Sumica's script is probably going nuts trying to kick him anyway
shut up MakerDusk: just hug her again!
...
/me hugs a Luna ^_^
the fire never burns dont it
/me hugs Luna
/me hugs Luna
hello everyone who is probably not here
Hello BroPony|MEDIC .-.
Phase4: that's ShizuKlaus' script?
>_>
<_<
and there are ppl here
evade XD
didnt expect that
XD
ha
Hi BroPony|MEDIC
:)
stealth +
MakerDusk, i forget who made what scripts and who's running them
shouldnt you all be sleeping :|
naw
nah >_>
IlL BURN YOU ALL
Watch out for changelings Luna
* Overriding KICK from Sumica on MakerDusk in #bronystate
Ouch
?
PRAISE THE SUN
...
Wur
o.o
Microsoft hacker is best hacker
burn baby burn
Phase4: does that help?
remember everypony, it pays to be a medic
DerpyMuffins: I work in a higher capacity here than at microsoft
didnt realise dari was running a colour kick
though sumi's closer to a server so
they're angry at me right now so they're forcing me to do base Office tech support
>_<
Do it for Luna MakerDusk
kick myself?
07,01Do what? :)
MakerDusk: Aiiiee, a fate worse than death.
im confused :P
whats goin on
so am I!!!
Hi, I'm baack
wb KrazyNoobs
/me hugs the engaged Luna once again :D
I am so happy for you!
You can only bend the rules so much MakerDusk
Luna: I´m still squeeing.
DerpyMuffins: technically I bent them over a year ago when I set the exemption and then not again since XD
Trampolines are fun, but if my dad were still around, he could have shown me some aerobics. :(
air tricks
whatever they are called
my hand is killing me
kill it
before it kills you
/me hugs KrazyNoobs, "there, there"
How long does it take for you to hack BState than MakerDusk
i cant, its my dominant left hand
I NEED IT
Sorry, I worded that wrong. He split up 4 days ago, he ain't dead.
DerpyMuffins: bronystate are my friends :s
07,01As am I :) Despite my situation I cant stop smiling
cachi01|ZahmbieU: so, hows the game so far?
why would I even consider that?
thelonecubone: main menu and theme song is awesome. havent played the game :D
I need to cool off, anyways.
MakerDusk: But what about the Geeks MakerDusk. You´re tearing us apart! Oh him mark.
For security purposes MakerDusk
/me turns off fire video
cachi01|ZahmbieU: oh, Lol
Hey everyone.
So has it been nothing but fire all day?
Hi male_writer
Yup
DerpyMuffins: that's what the GNAA is for XD
I
/me is trying to decipher the problem
did you know that they're targetting microsoft right now trying to get under my skin?
lol
GNAA's already tried to hack BronyState, they're not exactly a high tech group
Phase4: exactly XD
/me back to the drawing board :|
luckily most of the world are technological idiots XD
it's a pixel?
Phase4: I used to be part of them, they are all expert trolls, but in terms of intellegence, really stupid.
hey, when did I become a guest?
bronystate: how does you see a stream?
MakerDusk: That made me think of the beginning of 2001.... >_<
GNAA?
Phase4: And yes, there are plenty of bronies in the GNAA.
KrazyNoobs, orly?
MakerDusk BState did get hacked before
DerpyMuffins, didn't, mips did
DerpyMuffins: not by gnaa, thought they claimed the credit
KrazyNoobs: how stupid, Define it for me pls
?
it was a matter of the mips key being in the iframe
Phase4: Yeah, but I don't have much to do with them anymore. The 3 blokes that hacked our stream were the low class part of GNAA.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfpEhIQhUxc&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
Yeah I thought there was no confirmation on who hacked mips
a complete security fail on the part of the service
KrazyNoobs, can't all be that stupid, i meen they did set up that freenode spam a while ago
KrazyNoobs: gnaa denied it XD
any involvement
13phase will hate me for it but i'm switching ftb packs... again...
Phase4: Freenode spa,?
/me grump
spam*
Tetris time! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBj-wRSx7v0&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
ShizuKlaus, nah, i've got to try a bunch of them out anyway
thelonecubone: Well, in IRL, most of them are bronies, fats, straight and white, but they roleplay while on the internet. They pretend to be homosexuals and black, while they all also pretend to be haters of mlp.
ShizuKlaus: is it your script that I break every time I use colour?
have an idea but it'd require modifying redpower
Phase4, how did they tried to hack thie site again
13MakerDusk: i don't run any autokicks
or replacing it
KrazyNoobs: ah, i see
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMKTdrQqpNk
texasboykc09, attempted XSS on the search bar
A while ago
I am the man who arranges the blocks
ShizuKlaus: I noticed, otherwise I'd totally tease you with the overrides XD
13Phase4: atm i'm hoping to settle on direwolf20 pack, has all the updates and doesn't include the server crashy fail of twilight forest or overreaching junk of gregtech
I thought dari wrote the bots
urgh Brentafloss
Na, Elsie writes the bots.
Surprise.
direwolf20 pack looked good, tried it for a minute
Phase4, XSS?
texasboykc09, cross site scripting
thelonecubone: They use the name and their identities to confuse people who they hack (news channels, websites, etc.
man, when I first started off here I was so intimidated by everyone XD
13it's the most updated for the moment, includes mystcraft
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaI7cy5OLAM&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
MakerDusk, how so?
KrazyNoobs, do you know who set up the cross protocol freenode troll?
SpadeKyurem[WoW], I love you
07,01hm what to do now <3
SantaTheDuck: I was a straight up physicist, nothing else
MakerDusk, same bro /)
Hai gais
Oh hey Luna havent seen you in awhile
MakerDusk, i was even less XD
and there was dari, busy programming bots that kicked people XD
13luna~<3
07,01Shizuuuuu
scary stuff!
Phase4: No, most of the people are anonymous users. Only about 10% of the GNAA actually went with it.
/me 13brings luna presents <3
disconnected, weird
Phase4: If I had an identity, I will happily tell you
Are any of you a good demoman?
of the hacker
07,01dat nick
wait... is ShizuKlaus a girl?
13many grats luna <33
13MakerDusk: r63 santa
07,01danke liebe
...w-wait. THE Luna?
MakerDusk, -_-
her syntax seems girlish
so guys
Also, back in 2011, many people used to "crapspam" this chat.
13you did not know?
favorite version of fly me to the moon now
/me is a good demoman
13all this time?
07,01I did!
ShizuKlaus: I forget >_<
Haha MakerDusk you funny
and I've been nomming on you and everything
yeah, it's easy to forget gender on irc, doesnt really matter much
/me flees out of fear and embarassemnt
Crapspamming is the process of sending 100 posts or something like that per second via. custom software.
13i would think pink is a giveaway ><
Put dispenser here!
Need a dispenser here!
woo! just finished drawing earth pony armor!
ShizuKlaus, pink is considered a manly color these days
ya... welcome to irc where pink means nothing
ShizuKlaus: It could just mean you are a pinkie pie fan..... >_>
its not pink, its light-ish red
but Phase4 how else am I supposed to be ignorant and sexist and racist?? >:)
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: ERECTIN' a dispenser. *bzzzz*
MakerDusk you would have prefered noming on a guy ? (don't kill me)
PaladinDrakkenwolf: R Vs B reference /)
soulrider95, to peoples faces?
weeping_pegasi82: Cool, Are you gonna Post it?
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: (\
bye everyone
but Phase4, in real life they would kill me D:
I don't suppose you can hack a satellite MakerDusk?
soulrider95, :3
07,01Hmm should ask my hubby to wear pink tomorrow then
BroPony|MEDIC: dream of ponies
Phase4: Do you need to know the identity of the hacker?
thelonecubone: eeyup! but I have to wait...:(
Bye BroPony|MEDIC
EngagedLuna, do it
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I'm straight... but that only means things can be taken the wrong way >_<
oh
KrazyNoobs, nah, just curious
Bye BroPony|MEDIC :)
PaladinDrakkenwolf: I always do :)
DerpyMuffins: I don't want to go to jail
KrazyNoobs, we run 90% stock wordpress, if there was any real problem someone would now
MakerDusk xD
07,01I will and I shall
Phase4: If you wanted, I could go to their N-----NET and see if I could find out.
also, I'd need cash to make the antenna
theres this pink shirt with "Real men wear pink" on the front, you should consider that as a future gift
Phase4: ah, okay
I'm joking MakerDusk xD
a geo-orbital tracking antenna array is expensive :s
Accept the compliment MakerDusk
Can't wait to open all dem gifts tomorrow
13say phase, would octopress do us any good or are we basically 90% static as is?
other than that, the us military uses .net 1.0
stupidity at it's max
/me googles octopress
13not that i really want to set out plans for bronystate 3.0... nooo thank you...
2.1 ?
did you know that the drones are controlled via mirc scriptsÉ
I'd go for 2.5 before 3.0
BronyState is beyond awesome already.
hello
I feel like that would be nothing special to me >_<
It'll be like Bronystate 2.0 all over again.
v9000.1
ShizuKlaus, what plans do you have for Bronystate 3.0?
13i don't ><
ShizuKlaus, well if we were to move away from wordpress it'd be best to try for something thats a bit faster
ShizuKlaus have plans for total world domination.
I like bronystate the way it is... DON'T BECOME ANOTHER YOUTUBE!
prefferably able to handle our load without so much caching
Bronystate 3.0 will have a muffin dispenser
we're about at the limits of what wordpress can be made to do right now
wait... ShizuKlaus is a tech girl geek... :O
...
such a rarity
MakerDusk, ...
Phase4: That´s because wordpress is a steaming pile of hate
13no i am a shizu, not rarity
MakerDusk: u so silly
Merry Crhristmas everyone!
13vivi is rarity
I like your choice of words, MakerDusk.
Hello......fire
Merry Xmas otakon
Unnr, less hate, more stupid
gender everywhere, doesnt really matter much
/me 07,01misses Vivi
Vivi hasnt been on irc recently :'(
Phase4, are you sure, wordpress always seemed to try its best to spite the user
Merry Kwanza otakon
weeping_pegasi82: I'm having nightmarish flashbacks to the women in my physics and math programs >_<
EngagedLuna: um... does that mean what I think it means?
I feel so bad for the people they are dating
07,01it sure does
:)
/me claps for Luna
/me hugs EngagedLuna "GOOD FOR YOU!"
hi
wait so why does Lulu say engaged? I was listening to music and drawing....
weeping_pegasi82: what do you think?
nevermind!
07,01danke :3
But yeah, last time I had any involvement in the GNAA was around June or July.
I used my noggin
ShizuKlaus: congrats, you somehow inadvertedly gave me nightmares for the next month or so XD
MakerDusk: lol
(if only I wasn't joking)
WHURR
>nightmarish flashbacks so true
weeping_pegasi82, ye gods man, that's dangerous D:
13ye gods
time for some DnB and chillwave :)
I decided that being in that group meant nothing, and that the whole thing was stupid anyway.
What's the most legal thing you can hack MakerDusk?
13phase is a user friendly reader?
DerpyMuffins: nothing
Crud Puppy? Where?
Geddan
ShizuKlaus, i was at one point, lost track of most comics though
13yay ufies~
Phase4: I KNOW! I almost killed myself
Phase4, the site has to change agian by what you said?
unless you want me to hack together a program that does something innovative
13i stopped reading a long while ago though, i think about when he had that long hiatus
13link of the day was my reddit back then :P
i stopped reading after getting through most of the backlog, it was getting a little silly
wait... ShizuKlaus is on reddit too o_O
MakerDusk, you must be new here
brb in a few
MakerDusk: why is your right eye so much bigger than your left?
Phase4: I'm now afraid to go on reddit
brb brushie brushie brushing my teethies
MakerDusk: wait, what was that about girls in Math and Physics classes, and nightmares? I'm going for a Physics Degree and your starting to scare me D:
/me 07,01hums softly
EngagedLuna: no humming!
/me hums hardly
07,01okay okay I stop!
/me hums mediumly?
EngagedLuna: good :D
jcelios: for the love of celestia don't date a woman physicist or math major
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_2Jduxc2P8&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
my, what an interestingly titled EQD post
jcelios: there are a suprisingly large # of those that feel that since they have... womanly parts... they are entitled to everything
07,01new EQD post: LUNA GOT ENGAGED!
EQD or Dari messed up again
jcelios: they redefine mindgames: you will lose and embarassingly so
EQD, you screwed up the title
CONGRATS!
13MakerDusk: what about a woman networking major...ish..
mfw there is luna pic XD
ShizuKlaus: unknown
and that scares me most of all
07,01hahaha
13:3c
ShizuKlaus: IT or MIS networking?
MakerDusk, try electronics, there are no women
like anywhere
i think there was one in the lecture
13IT, more specifically it was for CCNA
ShizuKlaus: how is networking? I plan to do that or computer technician stuff after this year.
Phase4: there are here :s
lots of theme
Phase4,come here and join the comp engineer classes then
13though the program included some windows admin, active directory, and a bit of linux too
13at least i think.. the linux might have been all elective on my part...
eww AD
active directory is the definition of fun
Unnr, there's plenty in the cs courses
they have their own clubs and everything
13so fun story i've told a couple times
In other news, weed http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHwyca7gu7E&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
software engineering for me only 3 girls on my group
Phase4: Comp Hardware, not programming
13only girl in the AD class
13we take a night learning about movetree
err... I mean microsoft is the best... the propoganda they force on me once a month says so
13or trying to
active directory confuses me
ugh I'm in some business web design class, and let me tell you HTML codes are fun and all but it can be so boring sometimes
what's it suposed to do?
13moving an object from one domain to another
Unnr, ah
woah lags
VLSI = <3
I still dont fucking get whats so good about Linux
Hey MakerDusk, wanna hit a bank together? I'm gonna major in electrical engineering
ShizuKlaus: I bet you'd kill for my internal microsoft DB access
13when i think what they WANT you to do is set up trusts between domains
im not a Windows fanatic but still
Oh ye boys of #bronystate
fucking j#
SpadeKyurem[WoW], it's not as hideously complex and impenetrable as windows
13anyway movetree has a very very specific syntax, have to specify the FQDNs of the source and destination and the domain controllers and i forget what else
if you want to meet women in college, go into biology or one of its related fields
the day I learned that was a language...
SpadeKyurem[WoW], you can immediately learn how it works and how to make it do stuff
I'm the server manager for my high school. Pretty fun stuff.
you guys lost me when you got all techy
13sat down with movetree /? for like three minutes, wrote out the command, object moved perfectly
i've only been able to figure out windows after pretty much learning linux
Oh please Windows isnt that fucking hard for me to use
13apparently i was the first one to get movetree right in like five years of the guy teaching the course
Don
night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
the day I learned that j# exists is the first time I told the customer to buy a new computer while laughing insanely
Ǵah
So you can learn shit faster, that doesnt make it better
Don´t get eaten by the Yule Cat
Jólakötturinn is on the prowl
they were angry at me and had me doing vista support at the time
BerryPunch, stop getting drunk pls
they always seem to be angry with me >_<
there is only one thing that annoys me in IT. the users :<
but even the execs are afraid of me :(
^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekrnc4xZcf4&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ&index=33 Needs more Metal Harbor
everything would work perfectly if those silly users didnt screw it up
13linux' strength is in the community and range of software support, windows' strength is everything else
^^
/me waits in a bunker until the tech talk passes
meh womans in all major scares me, there is now womens in all branch that you should consider like womens :3
ShizuKlaus: sounds like a bad case of RTFM XD
13linux has spent the last dozen years chipping away at windows' advantages though
That still doesnt make it suprior to everything else
HOW DO COMPUTER? IS BUTTON DO STUFF OR IS MIND GAMES?
/me pulls weeping_pegasi82 out of his bunker
ShizuKlaus: you should see what bing looks like internally :D
weeping_pegasi82, ikr
13ohgod
13ohgodbing
ugh bing
Never used Bing
13remember, when microsoft did it, it was antitrust
ShizuKlaus: it is the best search engine I've ever used
13when google does it, it's google
please no Phase4 I'm just an artist!
07,01so much techtalk..
MakerDusk: I always assumed it was the tortured souls of fired Microsoft Helpdesk
/me 07,01head hurts
Why the fuck is windows so "evil"
ShizuKlaus: you can do full boolean type searches in it
/me sneaks up and gives Luna another hug
multiple databases at once
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: they want your money?
07,01yay more hugs <3
SpadeKyurem[WoW], try do something simple like clone a hard drive
I like windows 8.
/me hands aspirin to EngagedLuna
and full internet meta search
Everyone wants your fucking money
mmm, dd
Microsoft is no different
SpadeKyurem[WoW], the windows method is paying some one a lot of money for some hypercomplex program thats full of bugs
/me gives EngagedLuna some advil
Oh please like ANYTHING doesnt have bugs in it
soulrider95: I'm sorry, they started hating me before I finished the windows 8 guide, so I deleted it out of spite
as such, the forced me into fucking Office training
best part is sleeping
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: wow, you had WOW title for sometime, You've been playing that game for sometime :P
Phase4 Windows 8 isn't bad btw. I like the new start menu better than the old one, and its based on a much better kernel this time around.
had the*
SpadeKyurem[WoW], theres a difference betwene 'minor bugs' and 'OMG CRASH BLUESCREEN' that i was talking about
I havent had a blue screen in years
soulrider95, >metro
Bluescreen is to protect the hardware, that is it
>better
13ew start screen
Phase4: so fuck that
what is this i dont even
windows 8 actually causes me pain
13gimme mah menu
Advantage, Everything´s a file... disadvantage, everything´s a file...
You're starting to sound like a elitest
meh opensource full of bugs too
/me grumbles at x11 setup
ShizuKlaus: you don't know the advanced user features
but it's less ugly
bluescreen is only to protect computer hardware from bad code, not anything else.
One isnt nessicarily better than the other
I made a shortcut to the start folder, gave a windows icon, and put it where the start menu used to be =/
I usually just hit my laptop with a rock until it works :/
Unnr, yeah, i'm seeing some interesting ideas from stuff like powershell, but the complexity of it runis its use as a shell
ShizuKlaus: I've not written anything up on them, so it's non-doccumented
SpadeKyurem[WoW], are you coding?
13win8 task manager makes me happy, but asuka's staying where she is
and some commercial soft actually good
CrystalPhoenix: No, but my point fucking stands
but i regret paying for this
Phase4: Obviously its time for there to be another OS in the market! >_>
ShizuKlaus: the advanced user features all match or exceed the taskmanager
Unnr, it'd be nice to have some system of metadata, but i cant figure a good way to impliment it
ShizuKlaus: The thing is, win7, vista, xp, etc. are based on the CE kernel. Windows 8 is based on the NT kernel, so the underlying stuff is much more stable.
13i think out of everything i need to know one thing
Unnr, i actually thing its about time for that, unix is starting to age
13is the win8 command prompt sane?
Every OS has its advantages
13like is it not the exact same holdover we've had from DOS?
soulrider95, uh... windows > 2000 used the nt kernel
pfft DOS
ok I'm just going to listen to some music until the tech talk ends ok? ok 6_9
The fuck is DOS?
ShizuKlaus: what are you trying to do?
soulrider95, CE > some number also uses the nt kernel
Phase4: Agreed, actually, but it would be hard to get support without having some serious built-in emulation support
win8 ... why they need a phone from my desktop?
>not knowing DOS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cJ4kQSOnA&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ
ShizuKlaus: it's just as stable and useless as the one in win7...
SpadeKyurem[WoW], a fancy bootloader someone sold as an operating system
DOS = Disk Operating System
ShizuKlaus: I'm drunk enought that if I can't answer it in one line, I'll screenshot the internals XD
13MakerDusk: anything with the command prompt, linux terminals understand resizing but windows cmd has always lived in its own world
DOS : dat operating system
Unnr, can't be too hard to emulate linux's abi
I am going to continue to run windows until another OS has better game support.
yup
^
Unnr, plus it'd be unix based
13iirc they changed something about it in xp but otherwise the command prompt is about the same as it was in win95
soulrider95, *cough* steam *cough*
dos is needed because it's an operating aside
/me is rocking out
meaning it can make changes to windows without windowsx
Phase4: are all my games working on steam? with the same performance? I think not.
that's probably lost on most of you
* on linux
ShizuKlaus: it never changed much. they were going to overhaul the whole thing in vista, but cancelled powershell before it came out IIRC
Unnr, thats just it, i can't see that working :(
tech idiots
linux actuall have a good support, but not enterprise support
13powershell... concerned me...
whatever happened to that PONY os?
gdlk_ouo: What about dead rat enterprise support?
13linux doesn't make me use shift unless a file is case sensitive :P
/me 07,01is a bit surprised to see so many ponies on IRC during x-mas
07,01I call MAGIC
powershell is what happens when you try to make a shell script as powerfull as a full programing language
Pi is exactly 3!
Oh fuck Linux
EngagedLuna: and rambling about tech stuff also XD
it confuses those who want a programing language and alienates those that want a shell
EngagedLuna: so many people because they can't sleep, too excited ;)
hm, nopony noticed
Unnr well redhat is exception that you can have commercial product based on linux
We're all here to see you EngagedLuna
SpadeKyurem[WoW], ?
East Coast Bronies /)
I just go nothing better to do actually.
got*
but i think their enterprise even worst then microsoft :D
woo I am successfully INVISIBLE!
Phase4: until linux has support for SLI, physx, and ALL of my games to run with close to the same performance, I will NOT change from windows.
The only shit I'm getting is you can learn crap faster and edit files better
enterprise support*
weeping_pegasi82: OMG STFU PI ISNT DAT
THATS ALL I SEE
weeping_pegasi82: But if you are invisible, then you can come and EAT US ALL
jcelios: Ah know :P
alright, I'm off to play some TF2, merry xmas everrpony, and congrats again Luna
night everypony
Unnr: yes, yes I could
soulrider95, SLI was introduced with nvidia driver.... 180? cant remember, physx predated windows suport, better cuda suport, and opengl has a lot less overhead than direct x
soulrider95: Then ask Nvidia nicely to not be *explicative deleted* to the linux dev community
bye pala- dude!
Phase4: i know the technology is there, but because consoles, most games are still built on directX
soulrider95, litterally only microsoft uses directX
no one else wants it
it's shit
Good old pc eliteism
didn't valve find that openGL ran 30% faster or something, on linux?
13merry merry!
Phase4: but guess what 90% of my steam library runs on.
sheesh you think he would wait for people to say goodbye to him!
MY OS is better! No mine is! Fuck you all
Tassadork, yeah
13Tassadork: afaik it always does, it's just that the code to make it do so is a bit fugly compared to directx
13which is why everyone still uses directx
soulrider95, yes, and 90% of desktop computers run windows, doesn't exactly make it good
anyone going to try steam for linux when that hits?
/me reinforces bunker and then blasts pony music
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cJ4kQSOnA&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ
Tassadork: its already in open beta
I used steam under OSX... briefly. it wasn't too impressive
13next time i mess with takara i'll throw the linux steam on, doubt that can run headless though
Phase4: I never said that because there is more, it is good. I'm just trying to say since almost all of my games run on directX, I'll use the OS that supports it the best.
ShizuKlaus, the biggest reasons behind directX being used are courses still teach DX and opengl suport on windows is appuling
some machines just don't have it
particular ati driver doesnt even install it right
what makes a good villian?
what makes a bad hero?
ShizuKlaus: Not to be an asshole but the way you talk about linux is implying that Linux is better than anything is what I'm getting
what makes a funny character?
13SpadeKyurem[WoW]: no, there are just some things it does faaar better than windows
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Pshaw, everypony knows that Amiga is best.
So much Techy talk
something zen for you to listen to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UZBE8duru0&list=PL3D37B8DA9D8F4B0D&index=14
theres very little windows does better
http://i.imgur.com/dpoJl.png
Phase4: I'm not here to support the better company, or the better OS, I'm just here to play games.
Im pretty sure Windows can do some stuff Linux cant do
Unnr: amigaOS represent =P
My head hurts
oops there goes my strange mind again!
Tassadork: /)
and the things it does better are polish, not a technical advantage
13windows has the application base
(\
What do you mean polish?
13shiny
13eye candy, UI, etc
<.<
Oh
soulrider95, fair enough, and i still use windows for games (AND ONLY GAMES), but linux is just that much more useful
linux has better eye candy
So the only stuff its better at is attaraction
13much of linux still lives on text because for many things that's all you need
guys guys, acutally consoles are true evil :D If you talking about graphics on pc
/me <3 compiz
and microsoft behind zem
I dont care about appeal I want something that can run games good enough
Phase4 why not just make a new OS with the best of Linux and Windows?
ANYPONY WANT M&MS?
Derpy_Hooves: Winux?
Phase4: I have ubuntu on my OS drive, and on days I dont game I boot to that, but since if I'm on a computer, I'm gaming, I just have windows the default.
Phase4 you like tearing with compiz?
DerpyMuffins, i've thought of doing that, but getting it to work on the same range of hardware as linux would be insanely complicated
then i use it last it was terrible
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0oV3jid-0c&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ
DerpyMuffins: yeah... but the best parts about linux are the things that make it really hard to sell for money...
13as far as games go windows is still king, but hopefully steam for linux will push Wine to close the gap faster
gdlk_ouo, i don't get tearing
gdlk_ouo, nvidia card? their driver HATES compiz
no? Oh well more for me then! :3
Phase4, yeah nvidia
Safari is worst OS
as soon as i got an intel card instead of a nvidia, all the crashes stopped
like all bugs all gone
ShizuKlaus: Wine is shit. complete shit. We need native linux stuff, not wine trying (and failing) to emulate windows.
Phase4 I see, so you need the hardware to back up the software?
DerpyMuffins: Look at the history of ReactOS
The fuck is Wine?
13like i said
Never heard of it
SpadeKyurem[WoW], >safari
>os
weeping_pegasi82: i want M&M's ;3;
13hopefully steam for linux will push them to get notcrap
intel drivers native
you must be new here
in x11
as i know
Phase4: Look I forgot the OS for Macs, macs are shit anyway
/me gives M&Ms to thelonecubone
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: wine is an emulation layer, lets you run windows programs in linux/mac osx. sort of
OSX
13osx, a distant relative of one of the BSDs iirc
/me noms on the M&M's :3
and i'd have more of an opinion on OSX if it was possible to use the bloody things
13so it inherits POSIX standards
ShizuKlaus, not too distant, uses the March kernel
13where does Darwin figure in
13was that the previous kernel or..
Wine = WINdowsEmulator (Well started off that name, but now stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator)
/me parachutes into the chat, drunk
set of services ontop of March
March is a microkernel
So when does streaming resume?
13aha
ShizuKlaus: darwin is the bsd core under OSX, it's the only major open source part of it
/me stuffs face with M&Ms
i belive GNU Hurd uses March as well
13Unnr: gotta love recursive acronyms
or a march derivitive
13GNU's Not Unix, Wine Is Not an Emulator
http://intellinuxgraphics.org/ i remember can't find driver here for my laptop
Phase4: osx is actually pretty nice. you get most of the nice unixy stuff, and a stable os. the only problem is... you can only get it from apple...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4UTKk5eF1c&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B&index=50
13there's one in the "Yet Another" category i think
not perfect support though
Tassadork, yeah, it looks like it'd be the perfect os, except for apple
I drank 5 shots of Jack Daniels in 7.53 seconds no chaser and no vomiting. First Time drinking. GET. AT. MY. LEVEL.
Plus I think Macs cant run games that well
SpadeKyurem[WoW] gotta say, one of my fav tracks from the game
actually Wine means Wine Is Not and Emulator =P
ShizuKlaus: KDE Desktop Enviroment
next to virbank and humilau of course
I HAVE FAILED CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE CHAT
YAML - YAML Ain´t Markup Language (originally Yet Another Markup Language)
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: sure they do. dual boot into windoze =P
Am I wrong to say Macs are kind of shit?
Phase4: Also, until linux is a lot easier for the non-poweruser to work with, it won't gain much traction.
oh well, BACK TO MUSIC!
which is what I have been doing to play games all week
soulrider95, ubuntu
whats everypony talkin bout
Peanuts
no idea
Kipkat07_Scarf: stuff
Kipkat07_Scarf: techy... stuff
Kipkat07_Scarf: computarz
soulrider95, though it is not the most stable linux out there, needs a little work
and hi Deacon and Kipkat07_Scarf :)
Wait... is this an OS conversation?
hello
OMG
Phase4: still, some stuff is beyond what we can expect of the average computer user.
Kipkat07_Scarf, yes, it is
soulrider95, try install it in a vm :P
ShizuKlaus: But the best one has to be the Hurd
its trivial
hiyo thelonecubone
brb, gonna open some gifts :3
Phase4: I LOVE OS CONVERSATIONS
litterally click next to continue install, even sets up windows dual booting for you
13oh gimp too i think, GIMP IMage Processor
Hurd - Hird of Unix-Replacing Daemons (Hird = Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth)
Imo Black and white and 2 have the best Elite 4 theme evar
13oh lol
GIMP = GNU Image Manipulation Program
13darn
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdIFaHFHkpM&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B
Ford = Found on Road Dead
Phase4: I have it on my main computer, I know it is EASY to use, but until it is EASY and SEAMLESS, the majority of users will stick with other OS's
soulrider95, you don't want seamless, windows has a crap ui
terribly slow and any kind of multitasking involves painful manual window managment
Phase4: All I mean is, if the average user has to open terminal at all, the OS has failed the average user.
Phase4: what do you think about Win8?
Phase4: OH GOD THE HORRO
soulrider95, you don't have to touch a terminal
soulrider95: agreed. most people just aren't up for that
*horror
You'd be rich if you could ship Windows and Linux Phase4
DerpyMuffins, i'm suddenly imagining windows X linux fanfics
/me Phase4: I did just to get a proper version of flash player working. Just for flash player
my brain kinda cuts out there
DerpyMuffins: they tried that. Called Winux. TERRIBLE.
Windows management works fucking fine to me
soulrider95, uh, you do that from the software center
don't need to open a terminal
theres just far too many guides out there that are outdated
terminal?
:(
actually, whenever I get around to upgrading to a new machine, my plan is to run a bunch of linuxes in virtual machines under windows, or something like that ...
Phase4: but the software center doesnt work even close to 100% of the time.
Phase4: God forbid trying to work shit out yourself
soulrider95, odd, i've never had any problems
13software center is just a frontend for aptitude isn't it
yeah
Phase4: To be fair, ReactOS has tried to do native windows emulation. but well, yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOtWjPKc1IU&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B Remix!
Unnr, it's got a LONG way to go
Phase4: True story that.
Phase4: It will install flash, yes, but if you want a proper, updated version, good luck.
SpadeKyurem[WoW], how many things do you run at once?
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: why are they all 30 minutes long!
Can we just say every OS has its advantages
cause for simple tings alt+tab is more than enough
Phase4: not some bootleg version of the windows API.
SpadeKyurem[WoW], NO :<
13WAR!
13HUH!
Phase4: like what? Tabs? Programs?
soulrider95, o_O
13WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR!
soulrider95, the flash linux port is a native port
ShizuKlaus: money. thats it.
ShizuKlaus: Determing those still alive?
Phase4: oh no it isn't. Not even close.
uh... yes it is
IE IS BEST BROWSER
:P
FLAME WAR
13HEATHEN
I think the fire is broken.. I don't feel warm at all :(
soulrider95, i don't know what you're doing but i've got native 64bit flash installed RIGHT NOW
it works
works quite well
So whats everypony's view on Windows 8?
Kipkat07_Scarf, EVIL
Phase4: What did you mean by how many things I run at once? Tabs and programs?
Phase4: it says it is native, it works fine, but if you go and check the files, its basically running on a emulation
SpadeKyurem[WoW], tasks, how many different things will you be attempting?
remember, windows is posix compliant >_<
Phase4: Good, I was worried I was the only one who thinks that way.
Kipkat07_Scarf go bury Windows 8 in a hole somewhere
'
Phase4: Most of the time I just have Chrome and or WoW up
Kipkat07_Scarf: it's been painful for me. the desktop is nice, everything and anything related to metro is annoying. just give me win7 =P
is win 8 that bad?
Thats about it
Unnr, interix is the worst unix intergration i've ever seen
and i've seen one
13wasn't lindows supposed to be a middle ground between linux and windows?
Deacon: I doubt it, people always over react
because everything else is unix based
New EqD Post: NOTHING!
Windows 8 isnt that bad. I've been running it for about 3 months now, and it works just fine.
Deacon, try it
Lindows sounds retarded
13there's another one i forget that changes the filesystem standard to be closer to windows too
Phase4 is just a Linux purist
/me lights windows 8 on fire and kicks it into a hole of abyssness and eternity
it yanks you betwene metro and the desktop so often
13or was it haiku that's the windows clone
Phase4: then you are using it wrong
soulrider95, how could i be using it wrong?
13there's some linux flavor that wants to be a straight windows clone
How did this start......
i'm doing simple things like, i don't know, windows update?
notepad?
browser?
soulrider95: yeah, win8 works, and with enough hotkeys you can get around all of the stuff that's annoying to access, but it's definitely not an improvement over 7
Could any of you linux users not sound arogent when talking about WIndows?
....
for example... after using win8 for 3 months, I finally learned where they put the control panel
SpadeKyurem[WoW], i've used windows quite a bit, so i can complain and not be a hypocrite
Phase4: just find the option to boot everything to desktop by default, use metro interface as a better start menu, ????, profit
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: http://i.techrepublic.com.com/blogs/arrogant_linux.jpg
soulrider95, it's not a better start menu
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Nuff said.
WHo gives a shit about a start menu
Phase4: well that is opinions, so....
soulrider95, thing is the mouse is slow, keyboards are fast. in windows 7 theres a search bar in the start menu
Saying one thing is better is a matter of opinion
from that search bar i can start many different things
well i have to go so soon
best thing in windows imho
so goodbye
Phase4: same thing is in windows 8....... same functionality is there.
windows 8 has it
BUT
it 'catagorizes' results
WHO CARES
SpadeKyurem[WoW] people love arguing over details it seems
SO?Q
or you know, turn the categorizing off
and requires you to select with the mouse
Minor fucking details!
soulrider95, how the heck would i do that?
SpadeKyurem[WoW], ITS THE MINOR THINGS THAT MATTER :<
like stop QQ'ing about the new stuff, and spend I dont know, 30 minutes checking out the options?
Phase4: Oh god! MOVING THE MOUSE! NOT THAT?!
This has been going on for the last hour or two
I have a headache
Hem hem.
DerpyMuffins, ikr! its great
DerpyMuffins that long? wow, even more than the political debates here
Methinks we need some Yule Tide fun!
Im really trying to not be an asshole here but this is retarded
SpadeKyurem[WoW], mice are slow, very slow, theres tasks that require them and everything through the keyboard is silly, but windows shoves far to much onto the moue
Phase4: I told my mom to get me a new keyboard/mouse combo and she gets me a fucking windows keyboard/mouse that wont run when I use linux and the keys are placed oddly so that my pinky has to press enter instead of my ring finger
Phase4: All you seem to be doing is complaining about minor fucking details that could easily be fixed
/me 07,01tried metro and got confused
^
/me 07,01laughs softly
My mouse is pretty fast
SpadeKyurem[WoW], then why are'nt they fixed
Seriously, anyone who thinks windows 8 is complete shit has obviously not even spent 5 minutes checking options.
/me presents: The Snowman, Irn Bru edition: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yZOab5gl-4
soulrider95, i can't turn off metro, and i dislike metro
13it's not complete shit, but they've dropped the ball almost as bad as vista
I use vista
ShizuKlaus: ^
I have no issues with it
SpadeKyurem[WoW], you are a silly person
EngagedLuna, XD
I dont see why Vista is so fucking bad
And here we go again....
I really dont
Phase4: Then turn everything to desktop mode, don't even use metro 99% of the time.
13vista was doomed by driver manufacturers and stabilized afterward, win8 is starting out of the gate with horrible press because of metro
13windows ME :P
Unnr: I loved this cartoon when I was a kid
07,01yes shizu
SpadeKyurem[WoW] it's something about memory issues with vista
07,01the horror!
SpadeKyurem[WoW], slow, bloated, released far too soon, terrible colour scheme
Tassadork: <3 both that advert and the original
Phase4: I dont know..CHANGE THE COLOR?!
13i think i used it once, but i'd been on win98 til then and i was like 10 so it was "oo shiny new i don't know what any of this is"
OMG he drops the kid
ShizuKlaus: I has vista. I havent used other distros of windows though besides 98 and XP but those were so long back that I dont remember any of it.
^.^
13i have fond memories of 98, only managed to crash it a few times in the many many years i used it
SpadeKyurem[WoW], i'll give you that but the other critisizms are valid
FUCKING WINDOWS 98!
IMHO, the improvents windows 8 has behind the scenes far outweighs the drawbacks
*improvements
Also I love how people call an OS crap for ONE THING
SpadeKyurem[WoW], oh no, i hate windows for many other reasons
ShizuKlaus: Vista crashed a few days ago for me :'( first time. I was so scared I almost fell out of my seat.
13XP was okay but they shouldn't have gone with the fischer price UI, Vista tried changing a lot at once and got kneecapped by drivers out of the gate
Phase4: me too
Phase4: what other reasons?
i can start listing the various problems i've had but that take many hours
SpadeKyurem[WoW] well same thing could be said for other things
You do realize that Not every OS is perfect
Phase4: I hate microsoft in general
13win8's trying to bridge desktops and touchscreens and the press is almost unanimous that it's failing at both
Even your fucking Linux
So shut the hell up
SpadeKyurem[WoW], Linux is a kernel, and i have my complaints about it as well, but windows is so terribly screwed up in so many ways
But the way you say it its like LIinux is fucking perfect
ShizuKlaus: Exactly. I'm doing a report on OS history and Im saying how Windows is trying to bridge the gap
it's not perfect, no software is, but it's a damned lot closer than windows
opinions man, they blow everything out of proportions SpadeKyurem[WoW]
Again matter of opinion
13remember, all software has bugs
OPINIONS ON THE INTERNET?! FUCK THAT
ShizuKlaus: except that encoded in LOL memory
no, not matter of opinion, there are a variety of technical reasons why it is better
Rule of the internet if you dont like things how I do, you're wrong
<3 LOL memory
windows is never chosen because its a 'better' opperating system
it's chosen for buisness and/or suport reasons
13this is reminding me of the time i got zlined from an irc network because their lead ircop was a diehard microsoft fan and refused to acknowledge where linux has strengths
Phase4: Its more well known
or for the average user, because it's what was on the computer when they bought it
plus it's the one everyone knows, but it seems like apple is takeing over that
Again fucking remind me what Linux has over windows besides fucking polish
13well.. it's lighter
Phase4: which means it is better in that area, because it supports SO MANY established software, drivers, etc.
ShizuKlaus: And....
Cya everypony, and congratulations EngagedLuna
laters Derpy_Hooves
damn
DerpyMuffins:
Kipkat07_Scarf: Suck it up wuss
G´night DerpyMuffins
SpadeKyurem[WoW], faster, more stable, hardware suport is sometimes better though a little flakey, more actively developed, better installation frameworks
Fucking deal with it
Really a tab fail now?
like it has a package manager
13windows server 2008 r2 takes up 1 out of 2GB RAM on my laptop, just from booting up the very first time
seeya DerpyMuffins, have a happy new year (soon)
ShizuKlaus: by the time I got everything running like I wanted it to, the resource usage was only a tinsy bit less than windows
163
Bye DerpyMuffins
13ubuntu server with a full web stack is taking up 100MB
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Im gettig Linux on it first thing?
laters VenHur
SpadeKyurem[WoW], plus its UI is far more customizable than windows
It angers me you make Linux sound so fucking flawless
you can completely change its behaviour should you want to
ShizuKlaus: I installed Ubuntu throught wubi and it took up about zero hard disk space
13*technically* windows has a package manager in the form of MSIs but the one class where we examined how those work... i was scared off forever
Phase4: Well maybe not everyone wants to do that!
SpadeKyurem[WoW], it's hardly flawless, somewhat fragmented api, various incompatible ui librarys, and a lack of UI polish
13wubi does something weird afaik, i've never dualbooted
SpadeKyurem[WoW] tough luck kid, but you could always try for yourself when given the chance
ShizuKlaus: They scare me as well. Not sure if they or RPMs are scarier
but these are much more minor than window's problems
SpadeKyurem[WoW], and you don't HAVE to change the UI
but the option is vital for any advanced user
Phase4: remember, the average user far outnumbers super-users, and linux is just NOT friendly to inexperienced users. You can't argue that linux is more newbie friendly, and if you try, you are just being ignorant
Who cares...
i do
13MSI, if you want to make an installer, you must first have a windows with no software installed
as does a bunch of other people
What Im getting is Linux is for people who know computer programming
ShizuKlaus: Dual booting gives me such a good feeling. It's awesome to turn the computer on and have the choice of running Windows or Linux
13actually that and the installation process... learning that windows discs generally have all editions ready to go and it's the key that selects...
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: anyone can learn to use linux, but it definitely is a nicer choice for programming, and science compute stuff too
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Im teaching my 69 year old mother to use Linux
Why?
and shes never used computers
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Because I can.
13if you want to run a server in your house, you'd better run linux, it's extremely light compared to the best windows can do
Why is she using a computer in the first place at that age?
Kipkat07_Scarf: My step-grandmom switched to linux herself after she got tired of windows crashing
SpadeKyurem[WoW] why not?
SpadeKyurem[WoW], because computers are useful for people of any age
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: online banking, news, pron, etc.
And all the people who hate windows for charging so much? Idiots. like "how DARE they try to make a profit?"
SpadeKyurem[WoW], just to be here Linux is a kernel, it abstracts hardware for software, in this context though when i say linux i meen a linux distribution, of which there are many each with their own strengths
I hate the excuses about Microsof tis after your money
EVERY COMPANY IS MORONS
SO SHUT UP
the one i use for example is for techincal users, you have to configure most of it yourself
^
13eh i've never thought of pirating windows, except the XP ISO i have which was strictly for the VM for ancient games
whats up?
Tassadork: and linux or OSX doesnt do the same thing?
ShizuKlaus: If someone makes something that I want, they deserve my money. thats how I keep myself away from pirating.
So why exactly is the yule log using the youtube player?
soulrider95: with linux, you can just change it back if you don't like it
soulrider95, components of a full linux desktop can be replaced, and are almost always open source and changeable anyway
and I have actually been avoiding upgrading OSX, because I don't like some of the changes in 10.7 and 10.8
i can change window manages at runtime
13Kipkat07_Scarf: well and for me the various hoops you usually have to jump through to prevent windows from learning it's pirated, too much hassle, i just stick with my OEMs or use one of the dozen or so server keys i have
so, besides the OS talk, what's been happening this x-mas eve/day?
like how they dropped rosetta support, and diablo II won't run anymore =(
Phase4: except you know, rolling back updates reduces security?
soulrider95, ?
13TheGentlemanBrony: because we can, not worth the upstream bandwidth for any of us to be live this whole time
Deacon, not much for me
ShizuKlaus: I want to start learning how to run servers but my computer is crap so Im building one from scratch that should be powerful enough to do servers
Phase4: seriously? if you roll back updates, that means you lost ANY kind of security patch. And unless you spend time scouring the changelogs, and manually fixing the security holes, you have a insecure, easy to access system.
Deacon: Just got back, Got a shirt, A Sweater and some money from my Uncle, and you?
13Kipkat07_Scarf: if you have an old one just use that, haruko's been running irc and a web stack on 256MB for four years now
thelonecubone oh not much, just usual work nd all
soulrider95, uh, usually not, often the larger things that would be security targets maintain multiple branches
nice for you though thelonecubone
Ah
soulrider95, if you want gnome 2 for example, that's still maintained
Cant we all just get along and say every OS is special in it's own right? :(
ShizuKlaus: Okay. Now all I need is to be taught how servers work and how to run them.
Phase4: gnome is just a UI. I'm talking about kernel updates.
Minty Twistmas everyone http://25.media.tumblr.com/640f36148efc37c31907c8b89d2f2117/tumblr_mfjyw7mDU01rvl3xdo1_1280.png
13:P
<3 Minty
soulrider95, kernel abi is insanely stable so theres no real need to roll back updates
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: what's wrong with talking about their relative merits?
Come on guys cant we all just get along?
CrystalPhoenix and now all we need is pink snow.....
Phase4: but you were talking about feature changes you dont like, not stability.
CrystalPhoenix: Yay
13weeell you start by picking a distro, debian is popular because it takes a long long time between updates making triple sure things are stable, ubuntu is debian with a wider set of community packages but upgrading servers can be a pain
I wish I knew more about computers. I am going to be an IT worker
13there's smaller distros out there i'm sure, redhat and fedora are big server distros still i think
SpadeKyurem[WoW], we can
i don't see any of this as not getting along
just your little debating, that's all
It begins http://24.media.tumblr.com/39f1d3d52c17c8ac98f6dcf40cee794b/tumblr_mfkggx4GPa1s1v2zgo1_500.jpg
13outside of a corporate environment i wouldn't recommend windows server except to replace windows on a laptop, slightly less bloat in exchange for quirky compatibility elsewhere
SpadeKyurem[WoW], i'm not going to try stop you using windows, or even dislike you for it, i just disagree with it
Phase4: how good software is, is only 40% of the story. IT is two things, technology, and business. Even if the technology is better somewhere else, if the customer does not need/want it, then the new technology was a waste of time developing.
CrystalPhoenix huzzah for greedy selfish people -_-;
ShizuKlaus: what would I need a server for?
CrystalPhoenix: Greedy Kids these days :I
Kipkat07_Scarf, stuff
13well serving web pages is fun, lets you tinker with stuff and then see it in a more realistic environment
a lot of people seem to miss the whole point of it all
soulrider95, i'm still figuring how buisness and software should interact
13irssi+screen+putty is still the best irc client setup on the planet
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JUCfX1P1ik IT BEGINS!
Phase4: business and software rely on each other.
Smashing! http://i.imgur.com/ybUZD.jpg
13depending on how much cpu and ram you have to work with, you could always run minecraft :3
ShizuKlaus: so I could serve a computer game that I create?
13that too
This intrigues me...
13a basic web stack, nginx+php+mysql, opens up a lot of things you can play with
ShizuKlaus: Have you seen the telnet nyancat?
13apache's still good too but it's a much bigger thing, tends to be a hog when you don't have as much memory to work with
ShizuKlaus: How many languages can you code in?
13telnet nyancat?
derp
13i know of towel.blinkenlights
Phase4: they are all connected, E.G.: networking as a college major, started in the BUSINESS colleges. because networking is there to serve people the information they need whenever they need it. Not for technology, but for the PEOPLE.
ShizuKlaus: miku.acm.uiuc.edu
13Kipkat07_Scarf: uh... technically... php, can pick up java again, did a little C but not enough to be useful, used to do autoit
13wiremod expression 2 i think counts as lua partially
ShizuKlaus: What do you reccomend a hardcore computer user should learn?
13programmers get mad if you count html but it is still a language
soulrider95, yeah, i do get that
soulrider95, i ment in the context of software itself, not the use of, and how that should interact with buisness
13people rag on php for the many security issues you can get yourself into, but honestly i find php fun
Kipkat07_Scarf: hardcore? bahdunno, assembly? seriously, don't do that. but python is popular for people starting out, so is ruby
i hate php with a passion
Tassadork: What do you mean? Assembly is ´ossum
13throw some code up and see it do stuff, i love rapid feedback
/me learned to program in assembly x86
hmmm.... assembly sounds fun...
NERD SPEAK
13but then you get into real development, or god forbid wordpress plugins, and things start going to hell...
not for security reasons, thats an artifact of the culture more than the language (though php doesnt help), it's just terribly designed
Unnr, that sounds very much unfun
13phase would know more about that, my foray into "real" php dev stopped with our embed switcher
13Kipkat07_Scarf: do you have garry's mod?
i know far too much about php
ShizuKlaus: I dont has moneys so no
13oh
Phase4: simple economics: Business has money, wants more. Develops new software to streamline their business. This makes more money, for more research into new technologies. software, OS's, etc. have to be useful to the majority, otherwise money will not be made and more software cannot be created.
GabeMoist: It actually has made my major much, much easier
13maybe it'll go on sale this week
13anyway
13http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html < building that in gmod wiremod was a blast
13takes you from basic logic gates up through a CPU and on to writing a language and its toolchain and an OS on top of that
Well anyways, its 1:41 here so I better get so sleep. Gnight everyone
I only ever touched php once, wrote half of a drupal plugin. drupal is super well organized and cuts around phps problems, but I've only ever read bad things about php in general
i want to impliment an ip like protocol in 6502 for redpower computers
niiight soulrider95
13also i think i'm making hikari mad at me for wiping maps over and over
13i should have thought to version my myst php code, but i didn't..
ShizuKlaus: I rage at my school because I am referred to a computer nerd at my school but I cant even code. I FEEL SO INFERIOR COMPARED TO EVERYONE IN THE CHAT
13Kipkat07_Scarf: fear not that feeling never goes away :3
Kipkat07_Scarf: yeap. there's always a bigger fish =P
Kipkat07_Scarf: then learn to code
ShizuKlaus: joy. Im going to get some ice cream and grow out my neckbeard.
13X3
I know the basics of programming, but I never go that far because I can never think of things to do with my programming
Kipkat07_Scarf: you're on the right path
I'm terribly uncreative
I actually do have the beginnings of a neckbeard XD
13GabeMoist: much of my diary this year has been "i need a project!" :)
I did try to make an application in C#, but I couldn't seem to get the stupid GUI to update
So I'm stuck with that
13i made some horrifying code in autoit once...
yeah... it helps to have a job related to coding, provides incentive and lets you practice it all day
ShizuKlaus: Any good with java?
but like any other hobby, if you want to get into it on your spare time, you can make things happen
13used to be decent, forgotten a lot of it though
Darn.
Oh hey, that's my screensaver for my TV!
And Merry Xmas too all here
13my GUI code in java was.... let's just say it should be zeroed out....
/me has an android app in dev, and might be looking to get some java programmers on board
I was never good with Java GUIs
Then again, I was doing Java in Notepad...
that might be why
Kipkat07_Scarf: bah forget about that. software is such a big field, you can learn your whole life and only scratch the surface
13am not sure which is worse... inferiority complex, or impostor syndrome...
60 years later... *old Kip* I finally did it!! I am the best computer programmer in the world!!! *dies*
13there was a thread on /r/learnprogramming a week or so ago, like an 85 year old guy said he started learning code, best thing he ever did
07,01Sundaysmile a merry x-mas to you too
thanks man
07,01miss*
13man?
13:3
how about dude?
07,01dudette
gah
One thing I've been interested in lately is how people make game patches
I hardly touched programming before university, half of the people I know were coding in high school or even younger... makes no difference
niceladyperson
07,01that's better *smiles*
GabeMoist: like, ROM patches?
heh
Tassadork, I was thinking translation patches, actually
My father was a computer programmer at HoneyWell and IBM. He worked on some of the first computers. *smug grin*
13blaaah why are all of these seeds terrible.....
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
GabeMoist: the little I've read about modifying emulated games makes it sound like the blackest of black magic. more hacking around than coding.
ShizuKlaus: Oooh, what did you find?
because nobody seeds in 2012
just wait until 2013
13i think hikari is getting very annoyed with me starting a new world, having dynmap flood the CPU with rendering, then i kill the server and start over..
13nice hilly redwoods biome... with a giant "mini jungle" behind it....
GabeMoist: mostly involves loading the app into memory, searching for strings in the original langauge, swapping them out for ones in your destination language, dealing with obscure character encodings used on consoles...
13i just want a good coast with a forest behind so i can put my house up and leave it this time...
Tassadork, I know that some involve using disassemblers like OllyDbg and stuff. I tried learning it, but never got to far
13taking a good minute to boot up server with a fresh world... hard to test seeds with 50 worldgen mods loaded...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FHTDnaYD-M
bye.
Just wanted to pop in and say that before I go to bed.
Later!
Tassadork, but the big problem is that some games have the text files in these weird files. What needs to be done first is finding out how to extract the files somehoe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pemeKEUiDXo
yep! this is reverse engineering, something I don't know much about. there are applications called hex editors, that can be used to find chunks of text inside of binary files
I liek binary
I wrote an essay in binary and handed it to a teacher one day. Failed completely grade wise. Won epicly in my mind.
i liek words, you should use it to speach text
oh racist barn...
how did this song make on air? that's a heck of a mondegreen
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen
Tassadork, I know about disassemblers and hex editors, but using them to find out how to extract the files I need is another kind of black magic. But I did learn why the people who do the hacking are so rare though
homophony
homophony, homophony, homophony, homopony
?
wut?
firered
A mondegreen is the mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase as a result of near-homophony
GabeMoist: yeah it takes a certain kind of obsession, paired with technical know how, to tackle this sort of thing
:3
your new word of the day (tm)

Is it bad that the linux chat earlier made me think of http://loadingreadyrun.com/videos/view/201/Installation-Anxiety
13http://minecraft.vortalcord.net/ not the best with that blob of swamp and extreme jungle on the right, but the left looks promising
13also
13we should totally install linux on our toilets
Unnr, nope it's true
<3 toilet as a fileserver
Toilets that can store every move you make on a database?
I wonder what that can be used for...
i should install linux on my imaginary girl to shut her imaginary mouth
Or maybe recognize a word, such as, "Flush", and perform the action?
''eat poop''
''drink piss''
''watch millions of peoples asses''
and vomit?
oh yeah vomit
ouo: that would just make her more powerful
MIT had a dorm that had the bathroom attached to a sensor network so that you could check if the toilets were occupied
from your dorm room
going to sleep everypony :) goodnight and merry xmas!
Sleep well cachi01 :)
nite cachi01 :3
goodnight cachi01
Damn, 2 minutes 2 late
ShizuKlaus, i think linux toilets already exist
:o
really?
Wait, what?! :O
yeah, some of the toilets in japan are very techincal
one of the must be running linux
now, why would you need linux on a toilet?
i have no idea

Malavolent, Toradora. I made a anime reference.

13good for you?
.............
Malavolent, I... well it doesn't. I was just reacting to Unnr's comment. :p
ShizuKlaus, sorry. Streams don't even work on this computer anymore so I don't even try.
Ninjazz: Alrighty then :D
13i love how every bug complaint we've ever got amounts to "it broke what do"
ShizuKlaus: If it makes you feel better, I have been watching this video for the past 24 hours or so.
13no screenshots, no description, just "it broke"
They n't want you to see theirporn tabs open.
Stream just brokeded, what do?
Sabershy: *snicker*
>.><.<
Not a complaint. Just streaming video can't match with the buffer.
ShizuKlaus: What broke?
13[02:30] [ Moopy] Well ShizuKlaus i got the fire place on my screen here twice
only one I have is that the stream is about 15 secs behind the chat.
Oh.
that would matter more if it wasnt just fire
13it's a fireplace loop
13as for regular streams, the streamer is always well ahead because of delays in processing between source, provider, and you

wat
Why do I feel that I've missed an ep
almost done i guess
moopy, I'm not too interested in video games
Though I know I watched the last one
why not?
DaringDerpy: Are you Mickey the Dick
?
because they cost so much time. and bring nothing
this one looks quite violent
but the whole has video games man
Serenity?
that was creepy
wake up surrounded by pets
staring at you
gnawing at your limbs
DaringDerpy: The guy who made the .MOV series also made a game joke series starring Mickey the Dick, who absolutely despises games with a passion
d'awww
no
Mickey the dick thats a funny name
lot's of people aren't gamers
Well that was a good Xmas day
Well, he WAS a dick
they coming for RD souls
videogames don't bring nothing , they bring cherishable moments of wonderful story telling
soul*
don't live the .MOVs anyway
tetris had a great story
well to tell you the truth is DaringDerpy im a video gamer as well so a sorry
most games are about grind, clicking thousands of sprites to death
like*
Pokemon mystery dungeon red/bluerescue team had a great story
im much more into xbox elite games
hm...
I'm gonna go sleep now. Night everypony.
Congrats agian EngagedLulu

So I literally just started watching mlp last night. I met this guy offa 4chan and after he buys me a coffee at a late night cafe, we go back to his pad to smoke some ganj and drink some rum and coke. He had an Applejack hanging from his rearview in his car, so we had already passed the initial 'lol ponies' shit. Anyway. We're waiting for the vaporizer to heat up and he turns on My Little Pony. I fell in love with Rainbowdash and Fluttershy because
:)
Tell me where it cut off.
Fluttershy because
wait...don'T you see it yourself
bad copypasta
I fell in love with Rainbowdash and Fluttershy because I feel that bipolar that I strongly identify with both. Thank you, everypony, for already being bronies and having a community for me to explore.

Fluttershy because
aniderp|bestfruitcak: the lines around the eyes are a bit strong

oh
and maybe end up hurting myself ;_;
i stress myself/pressure to do real good

then i waited for season 2..
first i watched 'do you like bananas'
then cupcakes
and now i spend season 3 here with you call
all*
i got into because i saw the first antholgly and wanted to get some of the jokes so i watched the first season i was done with season one the time lesson zero aired
I have a witness in support: [25:62:78] <KrazyNoobs'sFriend> I let him do it, in fact, I asked him to do it, aniderp|bestfruitcak... spare my friend please.
KrazyNoobs: im joking with you :P
its almot 8...
everyone better be up..
and then i watched some ytp with ponies
and decide watch some episode
aniderp|bestfruitcak: Uh... duh, you are joking.

My username color..... [00:00:61] is now WHITE

aniderp|bestfruitcak ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) - thats a funny face to you
( ͡O ͜ʖ ͡O)
( ͡* ͜ʖ ͡*)
( ͡- ͜ʖ ͡-)
I started a thread on /b/ about how many Le Lenny Face variations they could make a few days ago. ONly about 50 people posted anything
I should have copypasted them into a notepad
they block that face
guess what time it is :D
ouo: I said Le Lenny Face variations, meaning not ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) itself, but other variations of the face that got by the rules
No mods at the time
:)
gangnam style time!

It's almost 2 PM here

not really guessed
i have stated i live in east coast xD
i knew it :D
i see
999 999 999
once upon a time when aniderp was 16 she went to florida then when she got back home to her state it was snowing
>.>
nice swimming weather to coldness ;_;
Easy to guess where i live. The most common answer would be i live in the central european time zone which is ''CET'' time to not point directly at where i am.
not really
Which means i live in about close to germany and somewhere in scandinavia
i just looked at aniderp whois :P
Halfway through my Fluttershy Zalgo
and?
killerpony7733 , you're from DK :P
Why do you troll us with this fire BronyState?

Raise this barn. Raise this barn.
1 2 3 4
racist barn
Together we can raise this barn
InB4 they edit the episode for re-air and change the lyrics to "raise that barn"
I came back to the racism of barns
fluffle, only if we can get over racism.
Kandarihu: With all those stupid soccer moms out there, I cannot disagree.
I'll be back to my art now
KrazyNoobs, I'm against that stupid meme too. It's not just parents.
<_<but thats the Apple family way
well they are southners
Kandarihu: Meme, I love that meme... yet again, I am still a fan of gak... I meant the parents as in them thinking it sounds like Racist barn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozJt3PGaC2A
Who’s the blue haired pony on the violin in “Raise This Barn”
repainted Octavia
She is not even in the family pic at the end???

Am I the only one aRounmd here who understood "Raise this Barn" aadn had no clue why everyone was saying racist barn?
alexxm hopefully soon :(
Lil_B, unfortunately for me, I saw racist barn before I heard the song so it kinda stuck. :/
Once you lose all hope
Lil_B i heard raise this barn as well but thanks to the meme i hear racist barn every now and again

Lil_B i was too untill i heard that
is racist barn a fancover? I don't understand
i had laptop .. but i almost fell 2nd time xD
while briging gifts down
I was watching the episode live. People were chanting Racist Barn IMMEDIATELY after the song started.
RAISE THE BARN == RACIST BART
BARN*
Raise the barn, racist barn
sounds pretty similar
thats all
Lil_B, no, a friend of mine who saw the leak said racist barn before the episode aired.
oh
And it spreeeeaaaad.
Ninjazz: So did this chat.

I hope I manage to get the new Episode thisd Saturday before I have to leave for the Meetup, I want to get the new ep so we can watch it there

Hi
how are things Simon
Bored. Sitting at home doing pretty much nothing
Socks are amazing
fluffle yeup c:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKbM_aqeMxs
guys guess what
Derpies
What?
present time i think!
Did you get socks?
idk didnt open anything yet
fluffle, it's fake, you can't find it this way on r34 :D
try it on e621 :3
No presents for me, since I live in Asia
Wow, too much information
:'(
Simon where in asia?
Hong Kong
wow
Simon, same here bro, i live in russia, so new year is only date to celebrate
Speaking of new year... I can receive red packets during the new year festival from my relatives, which contains money
Cash is the best gift of all :P
Eh, I suppose
omg
i told my dad to give me vanilla coke juts now
and guesswhat
juts?
typo
he got me one!
The family-sized one or the normal one?
can
xD
Did he throw it at you
was in fridge and i didnt want to move
nope
handed to me
After 80 minutes of work (I have so much spare time), i found out you cannot make art of Zalgo...
yes you can
well
zalgo is just the thing that messes up with everyone
Dͩ̓ͤ͘͏̜̞i̮̜̯̬̽̅̒ͬ̂̉͐d̵̵̨͙̘̻̬̗̣́̏̌ͨ̚̚ ̷̘͉̖̿̑͛̆͆ͪͯͣs͚̟͍̲̒͂ͯͪ͊ͨ̔́o̠̟͎̩̤̹͌ͭ̈̑̚͜͟͢m̻̜͈͕̳͖̣͓͒e̠͖͇̙͚̦͒̽̌̒̃̔ͥ̓̀ơ̶̡̙̲̘̙̗̰̊̆̏ͧ͌̾̚ň͏̴͎̜̣̺e̻̮̭̖̘̣̪̎̅̈́̅̇̕ ͩͪ̍ͬͥ͊ͨ͏̳̙͠s̎͑̃͞҉̭̭̟̘̟̖̦̟a͐͛̾̓ͬͧ̂̇҉̙̩͙͜y̵͎̫̗͓̻̭ͮ͌ͫͯ͡ͅ ̡̛͉̯̭̜ͮ̀Z̼̰̮̗̺̰̮̓̄̔ͣͯ̀̚a͉̜̿ͤ͗̄̊̚͟
KrazyNoobs: exactly like that :)
fluffle: you mean spirit?
opps
Whatever:P
I tried to draw a Fluttershy Yaying out of Zalgo, and, instead of turning out cute, it turned out creepy.
sounds like the darker side of Fluttershy
Mind showing it to us?
Zalgo is not allowed here, so I'll PM it to you.
Well, Zalgo is okay here if used minimally, but it is highly discouraged... rather avoid risking it.
On 4chan, Zalgo turns out good all the time, but IRC just messes it up to where you cannot make art with it
The chat's extremely cold...
Isn't there a fire right there?
and im going to church in my phoenix wright cosplay
minus the wig >.>
Simon: You just need to move closer to the fire
yay i bought amnesia, half life complete pack, portal and l4d2 =D
and i'm back
wb ouo
Bronysith, just the formal part? Awesome.
cachi01: be sure to play amnesia completely in the dark with surround sound headphones
wb ouo
Bronysith: of course!
thank you KrazyNoobs cachi01 :)
Kandarihu: after church of course
cachi01: enjoy, also, try and enjoy half life, cause people hyped it up to death
T~T
ouo: It is just a habit for some of us to be extremely nice to one another... that is a thing here on BronyState
not as good cachi01 , as people say
Bronysith: i like half life :) i've played it before
I like Valve and Steam
but yeah its kinda overrated
cachi01: ahh okay good, i like it, but i dont understand why people hype it to death
/me needs a dispenser here
/me dispenses a dispenser
Simon: as in , Simon the digger?
KrazyNoobs and it's wonderful! :)
Bronysith: and half life 2 and its episodes, i have those for ps3
i bought them for the mods :3
Simon the who?
/me repetitively runs around the dispenser
/me is a spy
/me from the other team
/me saps dispenser
/me notices that KrazyNoobs is spamming
After the guy who was designated as my Secret Santa gifted me Half Life 2 Episode 2 and nothing else, I went ahead and bought the Half Life Collection. Steam isn't giving me an extra HL2E2, though.
Simon: ah, so you arent coolio simon the digger, just some guy named simon
T~T
Yes
/me suplexes Simon into EVA-02
ooooh breakfast time
Kandarihu: lel
It's 12:14am here
