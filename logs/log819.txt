XD
You are pretty bad at that
CAN YOU BLAME ME!?
lol
yes
there are gender icons next to people's names
/me 08,01just made that up
I'm using Pidgin. I see no icons
not on IRC
on the forums
I never noticed
0,5Hey >:0
o.o

Hold on
08,01answers on a postcard

All forums seem to be designed in 1998
But maybe everyone else misses them
08,01hey, no fair

There should be a simpler forum

Solve mine after.

Kind of strange, but...

He makes good music actually
paintball gun

Hmm

Hello Saturn! Any thoughts on tomorrow's holiday? :D

Seriously
0,5here it is again.
0,5What can be used as weapons, but also soothe the distraught?
0,5They start and end wars, whether you like it or not.
belts
No lyrics
Deaths
Finally I got to watch Season 3 premere
as weapons? or as a weapon?
sword
bombs
idk
Don't ask why I didn't watch it
BUT FRICK
poison
There was a lot of Gak
Also, Hi peeps.
contract?
well if a dying person is suffering..
I'm guessing it's not their reproductive vajayjays either.
Hate Gak!!!!
0,5The answer is Words
words
Ayumi made that?
UR MOMMA
wow
that is pretty good
is it words?
Yea, I know, right?
:D wow
Like Words of Power?
One time, when I was little, I ate Gak.
words of emotion
0,5Words can be hurtful, and they can be soothing.
and had to go to the hospital
one time when i was little..
i put gooze in my underwear o.O
You dont get kicked anymore for saying g/\k?
Here's another
https://soundcloud.com/arcdreams/biohazard

It's Gak, but derpy. :P
May I say a little critique about the Season 3 premere
Women can be used as weapons, they soothe the distraught, and they start and end wars (or arguements) whether you like it or not.
You're having fun with this, aren't you?
Let's see
0,5Yus
Ayumi_the_dark_wolf
^
:I
Ayumi is on the forums under a hidden name
And we don't even know it
Ayumi_the_demon_wolf
It's probably Clock-la
:P
That
o_ O
Would make total sense
Ayumi_the_ethereal_wolf
I think Ayumi was banned shortly after I joined
TranceAddict86
^
Bad design, and no screentime = Bad combo
Yeah, the season three premiere was disappointing overall.
and he made a thread about how much he hated her
Must have been a heated argument
They had two full episodes to give him a little umph, but they didn't
There seemed to be an emotional disconnect between the characters and the conflict.
I liked his design. Execution was terrible.
^
Nothing in the season three premiere really gelled.
DarkstylePro11
I don't really remember
he was just pure evil
But the thread was pretty bad I think
Also, his lines were terrible
oh here's the best Ayumi name ever
"My slaves." and "MMMM Crystal" *slurp*
pretty much
style*
That "Mmmm, Crystal" line was accompanied by an awesome "BUENO" face.
And
^ :D
I liked the other villians because of their personality and screentime

Saturn I can work with Sheets, I learned to play the Piano for 8 years :/ (even though the actual Piano skills never got far :/ )

Hi Everypony /)
Saturn: Earning money from the songs you compose?
08,01Malavolent: surely not; we're a community based around illegally streaming copyrighted content...
08,01just once i start earning money at all
08,01but that probably won't be for another 3 or 4 years

Bill was described as being old, weak, and sickly.

13Reikim: FTB mods require Forge, Forge can't have bukkit
marry chrissy
Mm, hold on
I used to run Forge.
also just thought
as I understand it Forge is going to try to replace parts of Bukkit
It's been a while though...can't you use Essentials with Forge?
or rather incorperate them into Forge
aren't most of the mods in FTB the same as tekkit? because thats a bukket server
Also I'm fairly certain I used to have Bukkit, or parts of Bukkit, with Forge.
yeah they used to be seperate things
and were compatible
I'm not sure why the Bukkit team abadoned the project
why some ponies are fuzzy and some are skinny
I heard rrumors they were working for mojang now?
probably related
I am asking, was I just doing something inappropriate? I left this unlocked, and my brother could have gotten on. If I did anything, I am sorry.

08,01i'm not religious, i can't afford gifts for everyone i want to give them to, and i don't like receiving gifts, i don't particularly like spending time with my family
00,10one out of 4 is not bad I guess then.
Saturn Sums up how i feel about it too.
i for one, do not appreciate capitalism, because that means that corporations are calling the shots, and that usually doesnt mean whats good for the people
but enough of politics :)
08,01well, i'll use any excuse to cook a roast
00,10no
then no
00,10oh then 0 out of 4
then it just becomes lots and lots of mess

08,01i hate the religious aspect, the commercialism aspect, and the family aspect
That... escalated... quickly...
08,01J_E_Smith71: i also hate TV
Wait, wait, wait. People still watch TV?

08,01but that's not a topic for in here
Saturn: then why bring it up
08,01Yahooz: just thinking out loud, i guess
08,01the thought that i sohuldn't talk about it in here came after the thought that i should mention it
08,01it was kind of a backpedal
Saturn: sure
Saturn: abosolutly

I still have my old Ds :3
/me huggles Luna
07,01yea gimme a hug!
Congratulations

/me huggles Luna tightly
for something made out of nintendium it seemed more brittle than thin glass in a heated room
When is the wedding?
/me hugs luna
yeah
/me hugs Luna :)
8,05VenHur: that hurt :( these are my colours
I don't know, must of been the eternal battery or something.
/me hugs Luna
/me hugs Luna.
8,05if I ever choose to stand out, that is... I'm too lazy to script XD
the flippy floppy top screens
and the back light
WOAH
because the 3DS plays DS games
Sucks that the newer DS models doesn't had GBA slots.
When is the wedding Luna?
/me 07,01hugs everypony that wants a hug
But the first gen DS plays GBA games
Luna: <3
i know
which is awesome
but i already have a 3DS
Ahhh
i dont need another one
like the gak one
/me hugs Luna
/me hugs Luna back :P
8,05Luna: cheers!!! *chugs some whiskey in Luna's honour*
8,05and yes, I read the blog XD
Mainly because on the 3DS/XL Virtual Console, you get to DOWNLOAD the handheld games of earlier handhelds.
07,01will dedicate a blogpost to it tomorrow
then streamers wouldn't have to be giving warning during streams for that
07,01but since you have me on fb.. you can see the gift ;)
never touched the virtual 3DS thing
Luna: yay~
Are we on the guest list Luna?
^

I used my noggin
(if only I wasn't joking)
WHURR
13ye gods
time for some DnB and chillwave :)
I decided that being in that group meant nothing, and that the whole thing was stupid anyway.

Crud Puppy? Where?
Geddan
13yay ufies~
unless you want me to hack together a program that does something innovative
13i stopped reading a long while ago though, i think about when he had that long hiatus

Jólakötturinn is on the prowl
they were angry at me and had me doing vista support at the time
they always seem to be angry with me >_<
there is only one thing that annoys me in IT. the users :<
but even the execs are afraid of me :(

everything would work perfectly if those silly users didnt screw it up
13linux' strength is in the community and range of software support, windows' strength is everything else
/me waits in a bunker until the tech talk passes
13linux has spent the last dozen years chipping away at windows' advantages though
That still doesnt make it suprior to everything else
13ohgod

ugh bing
Never used Bing
07,01so much techtalk..

You're starting to sound like a elitest
meh opensource full of bugs too
/me grumbles at x11 setup
but it's less ugly
bluescreen is only to protect computer hardware from bad code, not anything else.
but i regret paying for this
13i think out of everything i need to know one thing
Every OS has its advantages
13like is it not the exact same holdover we've had from DOS?
pfft DOS
ok I'm just going to listen to some music until the tech talk ends ok? ok 6_9
The fuck is DOS?
win8 ... why they need a phone from my desktop?

that's probably lost on most of you
tech idiots

no? Oh well more for me then! :3
Safari is worst OS
as soon as i got an intel card instead of a nvidia, all the crashes stopped
like all bugs all gone
The fuck is Wine?
13like i said
Never heard of it
>os
intel drivers native
in x11
as i know
OSX
/me noms on the M&M's :3
13so it inherits POSIX standards
13where does Darwin figure in
13was that the previous kernel or..
set of services ontop of March
March is a microkernel
13aha
/me stuffs face with M&Ms
i belive GNU Hurd uses March as well
or a march derivitive
13GNU's Not Unix, Wine Is Not an Emulator
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4UTKk5eF1c&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B&index=50
13there's one in the "Yet Another" category i think
Plus I think Macs cant run games that well
actually Wine means Wine Is Not and Emulator =P
next to virbank and humilau of course
YAML - YAML Ain´t Markup Language (originally Yet Another Markup Language)
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Am I wrong to say Macs are kind of shit?
oh well, BACK TO MUSIC!
whats everypony talkin bout
no idea
Wait... is this an OS conversation?
hello
OMG
its trivial
brb, gonna open some gifts :3
13oh gimp too i think, GIMP IMage Processor

GIMP = GNU Image Manipulation Program

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdIFaHFHkpM&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B
terribly slow and any kind of multitasking involves painful manual window managment
*horror
my brain kinda cuts out there
don't need to open a terminal
theres just far too many guides out there that are outdated
terminal?
:(
13software center is just a frontend for aptitude isn't it
yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOtWjPKc1IU&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B Remix!
Can we just say every OS has its advantages
cause for simple tings alt+tab is more than enough
13WAR!
13HUH!
13WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR!
uh... yes it is
IE IS BEST BROWSER
:P
13HEATHEN
it works
works quite well
'
is win 8 that bad?
Thats about it
and i've seen one
because everything else is unix based
How did this start......
browser?
....
for example... after using win8 for 3 months, I finally learned where they put the control panel
from that search bar i can start many different things
BUT
it 'catagorizes' results
SO?Q
or you know, turn the categorizing off
and requires you to select with the mouse
Minor fucking details!
This has been going on for the last hour or two
I have a headache
Hem hem.
Methinks we need some Yule Tide fun!
^
/me 07,01laughs softly
My mouse is pretty fast
/me presents: The Snowman, Irn Bru edition: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yZOab5gl-4
I use vista
I have no issues with it
And here we go again....
I really dont
13windows ME :P
07,01the horror!
The Snowman is such a great holiday special
OMG he drops the kid
*improvements
13XP was okay but they shouldn't have gone with the fischer price UI, Vista tried changing a lot at once and got kneecapped by drivers out of the gate
i can start listing the various problems i've had but that take many hours
Again matter of opinion
13remember, all software has bugs
<3 LOL memory
it's chosen for buisness and/or suport reasons
plus it's the one everyone knows, but it seems like apple is takeing over that
13well.. it's lighter
damn
Fucking deal with it
Really a tab fail now?
like it has a package manager
13windows server 2008 r2 takes up 1 out of 2GB RAM on my laptop, just from booting up the very first time
163
13ubuntu server with a full web stack is taking up 100MB
you can completely change its behaviour should you want to
13wubi does something weird afaik, i've never dualbooted
but these are much more minor than window's problems
but the option is vital for any advanced user
i do
as does a bunch of other people
Why?
and shes never used computers
Why is she using a computer in the first place at that age?
EVERY COMPANY IS MORONS
the one i use for example is for techincal users, you have to configure most of it yourself
^
whats up?
and I have actually been avoiding upgrading OSX, because I don't like some of the changes in 10.7 and 10.8
i can change window manages at runtime
13TheGentlemanBrony: because we can, not worth the upstream bandwidth for any of us to be live this whole time
13Kipkat07_Scarf: if you have an old one just use that, haruko's been running irc and a web stack on 256MB for four years now
Cant we all just get along and say every OS is special in it's own right? :(
13:P
Come on guys cant we all just get along?
I wish I knew more about computers. I am going to be an IT worker
i don't see any of this as not getting along
It begins http://24.media.tumblr.com/39f1d3d52c17c8ac98f6dcf40cee794b/tumblr_mfkggx4GPa1s1v2zgo1_500.jpg

13that too
This intrigues me...
13a basic web stack, nginx+php+mysql, opens up a lot of things you can play with
13apache's still good too but it's a much bigger thing, tends to be a hog when you don't have as much memory to work with
derp
13i know of towel.blinkenlights
13wiremod expression 2 i think counts as lua partially
13programmers get mad if you count html but it is still a language
13people rag on php for the many security issues you can get yourself into, but honestly i find php fun
i hate php with a passion
/me learned to program in assembly x86
NERD SPEAK
not for security reasons, thats an artifact of the culture more than the language (though php doesnt help), it's just terribly designed
13Kipkat07_Scarf: do you have garry's mod?
i know far too much about php
13oh
13maybe it'll go on sale this week
13anyway
13takes you from basic logic gates up through a CPU and on to writing a language and its toolchain and an OS on top of that
i want to impliment an ip like protocol in 6502 for redpower computers
13i should have thought to version my myst php code, but i didn't..
13Kipkat07_Scarf: fear not that feeling never goes away :3
13phase and saturn get into the finer details of caching and my eyes go wuuuuuuut

I know the basics of programming, but I never go that far because I can never think of things to do with my programming
I'm terribly uncreative
I actually do have the beginnings of a neckbeard XD
13GabeMoist: much of my diary this year has been "i need a project!" :)
I did try to make an application in C#, but I couldn't seem to get the stupid GUI to update
13i made some horrifying code in autoit once...
Darn.
Oh hey, that's my screensaver for my TV!
And Merry Xmas too all here
13my GUI code in java was.... let's just say it should be zeroed out....
/me has an android app in dev, and might be looking to get some java programmers on board
I was never good with Java GUIs
that might be why
13am not sure which is worse... inferiority complex, or impostor syndrome...
