Another Arn movie?
yeah bye :'( :'(
13th warrior
Because I'll be able to correct Viking age runes like that, but old germanic are a bit trickier~
Because they are not really meant to write with as a language!
"None shall pass!"
Thing with germanic is they never actually used them to write with, as they where more of magic signs.
Yepp!
...did one of them steal his chestplate from a conquistadore?
hello
05Manearion, yeah i knwo but the chart with this "rune is this sound"
05using me memory xD
grouphug
Yah! xD
05so i know its wrong in places :P

Hello, everyone. :)

These halls... Very Skyrim
I have to go start supper brb

good evening
hi Micheal
Did you know there has only ever been found one viking age helmet in all of Scandinavia?
notin
hi Sweeti_Bot :)
ONE
HELMET
hi
kinda looks like something i saw in acentral european history museum
In all of Scandinavia, from the viking age.
13th warrior
some viking movie???
And it did not look like these guys's-
as ironic as it seems
The thirteenth warrior.
They never did~
05Dken2021: common missconception. the horns were ON the actuall vikings. not a part of the helmet
05monthy python proves this
They drank from them and played music on them.
dat advice
Never had 'em on helmets!
me too
Horns on helmets is from eighteenhundreds nationalistic paintings.
my speakers suck
oh, python
daaaaaamn
And it stuck....
All that blood......
well hung ham is best ham
Oh my lord is that a foot?

Ok. That makes more sense
Snake lady boobies~
I'm going to go.
Bye everypony
didn't he already kill medusa?
here we o
These are Gorgons
Medusa is ONE gorgon
well i know medusa was gorgon, but i didn't know they all looked like that
ill be right back i half to read the scedule
i figured they were some sort of ox like creature
oh my bad
and that medusa was just a high ranking one
where was gordon when ____?
gondor*
i was thinking more of hl, but thats fine too
:o
Persephone?
well, seeya anyway
BURN MOTHA FUCKA BURN
Brosiden lawl
I thought it was classy. :D
Who's playing this?
Ok.
:(
let the bodies hit the florr
Also: evening, all.
where does he keep the bow and the sword anyway?
I have no meetups in my area. Thats why I asked
Today I have realized something.
6>.<
Did you guys know that Pinkie's sisters and father are based off Inky, Blinky, and Clyde from the Pacman games?
Yup
Inky, Blinky, Pinkie and Clyde.
yet more fanon bullshit i presume
I also learned
yeep
I see we're watching GoW 3
hood lol
ooooooooohhhhhhhh shhhiiiiiinnnnyyyyyy OuO
the soundtrack didn't even change huh?
who's playing?
bpy, this movie sure is engrossing
PARKUAH
okay, this soundtrack is good
G2G to sleep. Goodnight everypony :)
I see zombies... In the underworld?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Married Again
no it doesn't
zombies are physical
in the underworld there is mostly souls
Everyone knows the underworld is full of zombies for the express purpose of messing with you.
Also: someone hasn't read the Inferno.
like ghouls
and ghosts? lol GnG
Well
Depends on which Underworld you're talking about.
I'm talking about Hades
yes
Which area are we in?
Hades
/me note: cannot see stream
Hades was split in three.
yes
Which area are we in?
Elisiukm
oh
I think
or the gates of erebos
Gates of Elysium or some shit
Hades do not have zombies
they have skeletons
I blame artistic license.
Or just plain Not Caring.
Actually, let's go with that last one.
the 3 judges, nice
I have an epic nosdrip from crying lol
and I know he was one of the judges too
Because, like I said, they probably mixed up everything.
There's probably more of the Inferno in here than actual Grecian mythology.
yes
haha
Maybe it's just me, but that seems like a real shitty reward...
I'm guessing these monsters can only be killed by takedowns, right?
I don't remember how Minos died, how did it happen again?
like, he put plant seed in the king's bath, they growed and entangled him
then absorbed him
Still alive.
immmm back wus up everypony
just remember minos
dis part of the soundtrack
Eh, I never really did the GoW thing.
I do remember when it came out, though.
*should
I pretty much dismissed it as violence for the sake of violence. Granted, I was pretty damn biased back then.
well, I played all of them, except 3
even the PSP ones
There were PSP ones?
yes
Brb shower
...
the latter being my favorite of the series
.................
Well.
oh cool
Well fuck.
Huh
...
oh no
lol
both
/me laughs hysterically
Anyway, GoW DID hold interest for me.
I just never got around to playing it.
Not my thing.
Never really paid much attention to it.
I would consider him an anti-hero, IMO.
back
Anyone know of anything that helps get rid of headaches? I have a really bad one and I took two Advil but it didnt help
totally
that's why I said there's no hero
Thus the concept of Tragic Hero, which I am sick to my teeth of.
Achilles took an arrow to the knee or something
BS POST
Hephaestus
I am quite literally sick to my teeth of the tragic hero.
nice
13you have to study for a learners permit, seriously?
Brb guys, I need a shower.
but its easy
yeah
For one thing, I'm pretty sure Chronus didn't have sex with everything under the sun (and then some)
oh man look at that action
not definitly 'good'
He's just not his brothers.
walking slowly i ncircles
i cant take this action
but he was betrayed by his brothers
Hades is notable because he doesn't actually do anything.
He looks good next to his brothers.
00,03twilight_sprinkle: Too MLG for you?
Hades just takes care of the souls
Pretty much, yeah.
Damn straight.
HAWL SHEET DAT COMBO!
This is why I said.

Pretty much.
But the Greeks...
Tragic Heros.

00,03on it Derpy~
Period.

okaaaay?
oh
I would know because if there were I would cook them, barbecue them, and eat them.
Who's he going to fight?
Hades
Wait
I know that
And her daughter?
Hades voice is awesome
I'm bringing something up into a conversation that ended several minutes ago.
Hades did, once, fuck up everything.
And Lex Luthor
they always say u wont get away but u always do
cannot unhear
Cool!
Kidnapped her, then tricked her into eating Underworld fruit, then she was bound there.
Hopping between Harpes like a boss
Was Andromeda Hades?
no
Um
Damn, roman name
00,03Persephone
Yes!
Persephone.
00,03Per See Phon Eee
Hades didn't fucked up that
00,03Thats how you say it
Yeah he did.
He kidnapped her.
Persephone just ate the fruit
He kidnapped her first.
Then he tricked her into eating it.
Demeter.

Dammit I gotta type slower.
Oh dear. I just realized both of my cats are in my room O_O
And then deal.

One of them is growling at the other ;~;

Thus the seasons were born.
INB4 Cat fight (literally)
00,03During that time, Demeter says screw you world and freezes it
Woman really loves her daughter.
Demeter could be a good goddess
Anyway: UND THAN THE SEASONS WERE BORN.
emphasis on good
She does throw a hissyfit for half the year, though.
that's her rage
Hissyfit.
oh
nice, what's a Hissyfit? not an english speaker
You know when you get a kid and they're being really whiny?
Hissyfit.
I would have a headache
but thanks for the explanation
word
Interesting that in games, a boss tells you to come in, obviosly waiting for you, but instead you have to go through a lot of crazy shit to fight him for real
Good times
such good times not long ago
maxing out Artemis and the blades and fucking up everything
till you get to Ares
immortal bitch
sooo trine is in discount how about that ?
Meh
Don't even know anything about that one.

Not the doggies :<

now that I think about it, Gaia is all earthy, she can be Fluttershy!
yup
lol
But if Gaia is Fluttershy
its my xbl name also
...Rainbow Dash?
http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/360/0/f/ghost_of_equestria_by_raikoh14-d4kasxw.jpg
Fluttershy deserves to live, she never did anything wrong
fluttershy is most evil pony
...Minus those two episodes.
y u hate fluttershy?
cause fluttershy is evil
SCREEE
>.element of harmony and animal keeper
>uses fear and intimidation of the stare to control animals
Dont we all?
i just saw the My little pony talking baby Spike commercial aahhh that thing is scary
Everypony just about breaks their element...except Twilight.
Not sure how you can break magic.
Fluttershy could be Artemis...

really? RD is worst for me
way too cocky

DONT FALL DOWN OR YOULL DIE
lol
Twilight is in third place in my list
Helios!
Boss time!
...Ew.
Why shieldmen no use their pikes?
>Brags
>Steals screentime
You could say the same for Rarity in Season 2.
and Twilight does NOT brag
in fact she does the opposite
Ms. I'mSuddenlyHangingOutWithTheMane6.
I don't like rarity that much, don't dislike her though
like in the Trixie episode
Twilight did the opposite of brag
Dont you remember Boast Bosters?
*busters
She was scared about showing off, and all that crap.
Ouch
Rarity is a mule.
I'll see season 3 first
now i dont want to argue ill get banned
Rarity used to be my least favorite pony.
Now she's up there with everybody
Anyway
Did you seriously think Twilight was bragging? She said herself that she didn't want to use her magic to show off Trixie because she felt that her friends would think she's nothing but a braggart.
I don't really support best/worst pony arguments.
Dat sun power
Good night everypony school tomorrow :)
*wouldnt dislike as much
Look away!
it's not letting me
Everypony is nest pony. But Pinkie Pie is bestest.
Case fucking closed on this topic that everyone is sick of.
all the fans are terrible
best*
I just try to defend her when people say they hate her
there, i saved you a bunch of bitching
probably
You hurt my feelings.
*the
Curbstomp
Oh
I hate Rainbow Dash because she's fucking cocky, and I hate cocky people (also ponies)
i cant think of a good head pun!
~DECAPITATIOOOOOOOOOOOON~
the rest are tolerable
>Rainbow Horse
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Herakles is next boss
wee
okay everypony i have to go now
have a nice day all
I dunno that was the most recent head joke I've heard lately. Quickest one that came to mind
goddamn
Oh for fuck's sake.
Typically, the main character introduced has lots of screentime.
well time for me to sleep. cya everypony
You'd be hating EVERYbody.
For fuck's fucking sake and you know I'm pissed because I'm swearing.
now Helios comes w/ HEADLIGHTS :D
Someone kick them or something?
Aaaaaaah
AAAAAAAGH
Fuck manechat.
TS is making an issue again.
There's a burgular outside my house.
inb4 some mod chokes a bitch
I hit him with the glass I randomly had.
Repeatedly.
and he ran.\
13in this thread, dozens of ponies that can't read the channel topic
I wish a mod would choke a bitch.
I am not trying to make other people like fluttershy
just defending her, and exposing my opinions
choking keeps things in line
Ask Darth Vader. The odd choking keeps the minions in line.
another one?
lol
i hate these enemies
I remember that interview with Tara where she says roughly, "I don't get where this whole debate about best pony comes from. When was it not clear that Twilight is best pony? I thought that was known. :/" :D
just came to gauge the excite levels for the possible!season3 announcement that may or may not be coming.
*flutterchu
No, Pinkie Pie is the best pony.
13this is doom 3 right
In which he pretends to be morally superior to everyone and everything. Again.
13except darker
Magina-like
Really I don't know how he manages it.
Meme
Half the time he's actually one of the more reasonable chatters.
I have. but have you ever eaten brinner?
Aw, but I like best pony debates :(
SppedyBolt how do you know tha- 0_o nvm i DONT wanna know :D
13DO YOU EAT
brinner is best meal. pancakes at 11pm
Then you get him going, and oh, suddenly he's the onyl right one, everyone else is wrong, it's because they're the way they are not they're fault he can't possibly be wrong.
:3
13i don't eat either
not yet
but magina is there
13ponies are very very bad at "don't feed the trolls"
13can we stop with the pointless bitching about twlight..
He's just an egotist.
See, everything falls into place.
Grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw
chris-chan is still in prison i believe
I have something to say, don't hate ponies.
he never went to prison in the first place

Oh my..
It's the arrogance.
Freefalling looks fun
dis part is awesome
All the arrogance.

There are no pony ranks.
good evening everypony :)
I want to go Skydiving one day.
It's nearly 12 over here, and i'm still up.
I have school tomorrow, and I regret nothing.
just like with reddit and 9gag
why does he have wings?
Because everything needs wings.
tomorrow is Independence Day in my country
stole them from Icarus in GoW2
Need to make something more hip? Add wings.
neat
lol
Need to add angelic sybolism? Add wings.
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vZk13imFkqY/TecyzHdGqhI/AAAAAAAAFWc/U74VpB-Va0k/s1600/P4ZHZ.gif by this graph it actually seems like twilight has less screen time than fluttershy
Shouldnt Kratos' wings have burned up already, if he stole them from Icarus?
Icarus' wings only burn when they go near the sun
a story warning about the hubris of man
Really, there is nothing that wings cannot do.
it's not Icarus wings
Except make food for you.
icarus died, and fell with his wing
/me deshi deshi basara basara
They cant make food for you.
the wings are from daedalus
Wings can make food for you.
They can?
I need to learn that tech.
Need to hunt down an animal and kill it? Add wings.
Reverse leap of faith
Besides, Fluttershy has demonstrated to us that wings can be used dextrously.
Are you still going on about that
No
Imagine if Fluttershy and RD's personalities got switched.
/me deshi basara deshi basara deshi deshi basara basara
/me calms the fuck down
We've offically messed up.

I know I would.
He's a good sort, really.
I'm helping him with a TTGL fic now that he's rewriting.
thats assuming i'm not a ultra buff spartan
eh, fair enough
i know they made these three
13extra credits did an episode on the series a while back
they amde some for the psp, didn't they?
13and how disappointing it is that they destroyed the story they built in 1
yes
Exactly.
ttgl uhmm tengen toppa ?
13can't see it capn
well i suppose if you're going to milk the cash cows press the tits for all you can get

Whaaaaat
uuugggghhhh sooo much rainbow
Makes sense.
Most people actually in need of money do not have the confidence to go up and ask someone.
but since I looked like I make money, he came after me
Though this does looks interesting.
cary?
You do make money now.
...You do make money now, right?
my name is The Master
this game's got them out the shitter it seems
I am, but nothing hits the bank account until this weekend

and that unbeatable Xbox game...Ninja Gaiden I think.
lol
They can't be any old sunglasses too.
I talked with the first employee I saw to get security on him
They have to be the opaque, square kind.
I've honestly never seen anything like that before.
The worst I've seen is beggars in the streets, which make me sad.

Bullshit.
dat laugh
Always.
kill blood, how do?
hermes is mad pinkie
only hera was ever a bitch it seemed
He's not even a good con.
which made zues wanting to cheat understandable.
"broke my ankle, just got out of the hospital", walked just fine to catch up with me, and I walk fast
Hades being the broest of gods.
dat action
I suppose.
I guess not everyone's as paranoid as I am...
still need to kill hermes, herakles
EXPOSITION
and some others I don't remember
and fuck Aphrodite
they're usually just high, drunk, or idiots at that time of night
Hello everypony.
why would you kill herakles?
And I'm guessing you don't fall into any of the three.
:)
this isn't one. Two or Three?

if I want a story I'll read a book
RDR has a great story from beginning to end and, although it is existant, it's more than just blood and sex.
A pinapple under the sea?

Most of the dumb teens I know STILL play games like CoD

Erm... Not sure if I'd want to buy ALL the DLC.
That's the thing, you think you're getting a deal with buying all the DLC's because you think you're going to get them all anyway
Because the infantry combat in BF3, imo, kinda sucks.
If they lowered the disabled threshhold of vehicles. -.-
Nijazz I beg to differ but everyones entitled to their own opinion.
Also AC-130 is gonna be interesting
Anyway don't try to talk me out of premium alright. My mind is set on traget.

Uprising is fun for me
People say it plays bad, but it really doesnt
My kitchen sink! Can you believe it? I thought I lost it, but it was under the dishes the whole time. Who'da thunk it, huh?
Hello?
I always annoys me when people bitch about control issues in games they have when I never have them ever
*It
eh, don't think they stream repeats
controls are my favourite thing to blame for my shitting playing, along with cerma angles
shitty*
camera*
:)
Woah
that spawn
Skyward Swords controls were shitty
but there were some moments where they workded well
I never had a fucking problem with SS' controls
I wished they would have learned and made crysis 3 like crysis 1 but no...
anyway gotta go everypony. Bye!
That happened sometimes but I dealt with it
times where you swung one way and it registered a differnt direction
i could deal with it too
Never happened
bye
but not when it made it impossible to kill things
Has anybody played The House 2?
I never had a issue killing onsters
O.o
i dislike the controls
It wonked out a bit sometimes but it didnt get unbearbly bad
:p
Victory?
O.o
Nah , just curious.

Welp

God-damned rare spawns of rare spawns.

Dr.reed O.o
Firelands was Amazing!! DS was a shame....
Oh there she is.
Fight is hard enough... I dont need a knock back effect added
the only interesting part was the back fight, and even that felt underwhelming
?
Duuuuuun
Ahhh
Allright
I have this weird talent that allows me to immitate voices pretty much perfectly
I wanted to fight Deathwing! not his damn little spawns...
Thats a pretty epic talent
I think its over
I have no idea how to raise my mana count in MoP
Allo everyone.
One does not simply stick around after 3 wipes.
TOO MANY DRUIDS!!!
why would you leave after three wipes?
Where's my combat res? We used it on the shaman. Whyyyyyyyyyy.
i did that i'd be outta my guild quicker than rain in thed esert
Tbh I think this is more of a PuG discussion
bah
Since leaving in the middle of a guild raid is for only the most lowly of douchebags.
http://jayisgames.com/games/the-house-2/
My guild wasnt bad..... but they Constantly gave away my raid spot =_=
Does anyone know how mana is raised in MoP
Intelegence no longer does that
LFR is utter shit
