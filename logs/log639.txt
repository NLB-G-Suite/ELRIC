it's earraping
tSparx: why would you sell classic consoles?
No, ear rape is the czech version of at the gala.
"Sees Skrillex"..."turns off video"
:D
Did the stream die?
Its just off :P
Kawaii_icybeauti: :D hello by the way
heck Scary monsters and nice sprite is what made me hate dubstep
RoboGerbil: I was 9, I have no idea why I did it, or if *I* even did it, could've been my parents *shrug*
No one else gonna step in?
Maybe, we dont know
hay icy
Wirisme: Well, at *some* point :P
lemme go dig that out....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BL90EV4HX8 If you can survive thi, you are a maaann.
tSparx: i still have my atari, genesis and ps2
RoboGerbil: The gamecube broke a few years after i got it, and the PS2 broke about 4 years ago.
RoboGerbil: My parents own a PS3, I am console-less :(
I would never hate a genre of music because of one song XD, thats like hating Bronys just because some people are too extreme...
Kawaii_icybeauti, well for one it's not earrape, while the voice are off-tunes and out of rhythm
gawd, I can't even hear a full minute.
it's still hearable
Kawaii: 6_9

BladedWings yep
hi! hi hi!
lali-ho RoboGerbil
Manearion: nope it ded
Well, I have no friends in any classes except for my lunch period..
The stream is deadd
Ok, i used my nickname....NO ONE ELSE will notice me
no homewokr for getting A+ on test :D
flutteryay: yay!
homework lol
flutteryay: Nice! :D
I have to start mine...I'm sooooo lazy....
ikr!
flutteryay: LIKE A BOSS
and how the heck dose this look like a crying or tears face: T_T
flutteryay: Good job :)
I saw someone wearing a DJ-PON3 shirt today
i have a health class thing to do....its basicallya survey
flutteryay sounds like your teacher bribes for good grades
I still have to finish mine! :D
I wanted to go over and randomly brohoof this stranger
DeathFlames: Well, if it has serifs on it, it doesn't
thanks everypony
then decided it would be way too weird
Prince_Blueblood: Nice!
DeathFlames: Those little things coming down off the sides of the top of the T
Too many chats to keep track of!
Prince_Blueblood: should have done it lol
Prince_Blueblood: You could've asked if they liked the show or just thought the shirt was cool.
/me bashes head on Scootaloo
we need a stream to focus
missing plugin SHIT
DeathFlames: But imagine that the top of the T is a closed eye, and the line going down from it is a stream of tears.
I got a stream
he was talking to someone and going the opposite direction
.. in like.. 10 mins
would have been pretty awkward to do it
no i mean its like l are the eyes of the face and this
Wirisme what's wrong wiwth talking?
also, I've never seen a non-brony wear a brony t-shirt
and this is liek the eyebrow of the face: -
why wont the video work T_T
The only good thing is my science class. Somebody wrote a Korn logo into the teacher's desk, and since I sit right infront of the desk and just stare at it.
nothing
that would be weird lol
No stream means more communication.
Twilight_Sparkle
/me So what does Rainbow Dash in a normal life..........make this PMV! LIKE A BOSS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omFG-MHqWw4
KnifeH: Did a mod give you permission to stream? How unusual :)
Prince_Blueblood its weird not to brohoof him.
my brony friends saw the derpy shirt i got over the summer. they are trying to convince their friend to join the herd and said "(my name) is wearing a brony shirt, why not u?" lol
lol
teleporting toaster tasers
I look like a grumpy old man
Dken2021: 10 different conversations happen at once (not that that doesn't happen anyway)
Dark92Whatever: I love that one!
Prince_Blueblood: I have, cause I bought it for him and told him "If I get you this job, you have to wear it once every week
so I'd look weird in a brony tshirt
He's still holding up to his promise.
lol
brb
DeathFlames well the Ts look like crying eyes to me, just saying
brb bathroom
Well, the brony I met is still hanging around, along with my other friend who's a brony.
hey
ello fluff-e
tampering ticking tongs of tickling turtles
I work with a Brony
back anyway why is the video not working
fluff-e: Hi! :)
DeathFlames: T_T <--- the top of this isa closed eye, the vertical line is a trail of tears, the underscore is a mouth
SO many convos! :D

DeathFlames: Ok, well, this ;........{ doesn't make any sense to me, and I'm just telling you how T_T is to be interpreted, not whether I think it's good or not

13th warrior
compeutor derped
Because I'll be able to correct Viking age runes like that, but old germanic are a bit trickier~
ohai everypony :)
Because they are not really meant to write with as a language!
Dark_Horst: & PillowPoni Thats not funny guys :(
Hello Michael
05Manearion: probably germanic. i onyl used what i remembered from hostory class
Ah, ok!
MLP_Brovakiin: Well dipping a biscuit in tea is delicious....for me that is
MLP_Brovakiin: and that's not viking armor the guy had on
05but you can help me correct it later anyways
hi Michael
"None shall pass!"
Thing with germanic is they never actually used them to write with, as they where more of magic signs.
Yepp!
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin BladedWings
ello Michael
...did one of them steal his chestplate from a conquistadore?
hi Michael :)
/me hugs Dken2021 thelonepony
/me is hugged "i getting so many hugs today ^_^"
hello
They had sounds connected to them, sure, but writing came later, and was probably inspired by the arabs to a degree.
/me hugs Michael back :D
PillowPoni: Its not funny when the biscuit falls into the tea though...
BTW, while we are at it....HAPPY LEIF ERRICSON DAY! Lingo-lingo-DORGAN!

ohai Samara

hi Sweetie_BOT and God
PillowPoni: Wait, you dunk biscuits in carbonated drinks!?!
Dken2021: Don't forget the gladiator helmets.
ohai God and Sweetie_BOT
hi MLP_Brovakiin
nords = vikings, redguards = arabs
good evening
hi God
Wasup God
hi Micheal
Did you know there has only ever been found one viking age helmet in all of Scandinavia?
notin
biscuits and tea? sounds silly
hi Sweeti_Bot :)
that blonde guy witht he pelt cape, where dit he get his?
MLP_Brovakiin: No, but I've had one fall in my drink. That drink went into the sink

HELMET
hi
kinda looks like something i saw in acentral european history museum
In all of Scandinavia, from the viking age.
what am i watching sirously
13th warrior
some viking movie???
05God: you wre already told what you were watching
And it did not look like these guys's-
PillowPoni: Oh god, that wouldn't even be worth salvaging
yes but idk what that is
05stop asking a dumb question that you've arleady gotten the answer to
as ironic as it seems
Manearion it didn't have stereotypical horns on helmet did it?
The thirteenth warrior.
God is trolling us
Nope xD
God: Long time no see, how are the wife and kids
MLP_Brovakiin: Nope. Poured it down the sink, and got more soda.
They never did~
God: you wanted the name of the movie, that is the name of the movie. everything else should be obvious. if you want plot narration, askw ikipedia
05Dken2021: common missconception. the horns were ON the actuall vikings. not a part of the helmet
God: if you're not really omniscient, then Wikipedia is
05monthy python proves this
They drank from them and played music on them.
Wait, so what you're telling me is, Mel Brooks was right as well Wrek?
dat advice
Never had 'em on helmets!
Wrek: that's from hägar, isnt it?
05Everlasting_Joy: im still waitign for jews in space

Horns on helmets is from eighteenhundreds nationalistic paintings.

Wrek: Can't argue with that
I freaking hate 4kids for ruining loder aged animes. :|
Wrek: I can make sense out of anything. ANYTHING!

im planning on after being here for a long time maybe try out to be a mod and then work my way up but who knows
13you don't work your way up

what do mods do anyway
Vivix why not just trap the contextmenu event?

oncontextmenu
did eldude say anything before he left?

13dynamo2814: see the page you're looking at and all the pages it links to, that's what i did
dynamo2814: Keep order, stream content, work on the site and its backend
I'm terrible with JS- so that might work if I read up on it
Vivix do some research maybe it will help
fucking brother took the last of the mac & cheese.I LOVE MAC &
oh ok, just curious
what I'm doing now is just trying to get a button value from addEventListener- but it seems it always returns 1-

00,02Brad[Laptop], :<
lol
Brad[Laptop], ookay- hm that might work, thanks! /readsmore about that
Also I hope the staff in MLD the movie will find a better voice than Rinuh-Chen for Rarity
I`m going to get trucked in football tomorrow morning...
00,02Brad[Laptop], look at ruby python and javascript
I've dabbled in programming a lot, but whenever I want to do something I have to relearn everything
00,02those > php
Phase4: no hugs?
/me glomps Phase4
/me 00,02hugs Bronysith back
*football training
All the Phase4 color :P
Phaser set to hug
Ponies47, well now you ruined it :P
Back to my physics!
SET PHASERS TO HUG!!!!:[
MLD the movie?
Phase4 already have, tried ruby, didnt like it, dont know much aboyt python but have modified the occasional script, I feel that php is more mature as a server side web dev language than python, for javascript you could use node.js which I have heard is good, but kind of prefer to stick with what I know for now.
Hiya Phase4
is that actually happening Applejack2012
im sad guys i lose the hub tomorrow, i feel like its just in time for season 3 too
Applejack2012: My little Donkey??
dynamo2814 internet is wonderful.
alexxm: It's already happened.
Phase4: Ewww a naked Phase4 D:
alexxm: It's a fandom movie.
dynamo2814 you still have us, whenever season 3 will start
Hey guys :)
Hey BronyInstrumental
BronyInstrumental: Hi! :)
hai BronyInstrumental
hi
Hey BronyInstrumental
Brad[Laptop], i can understand that but its really time to move away from php, webs large enough and apps are complex enough that its becoming the bottleneck
AJIsAweosme i guessed it was a brony thing is it good?
oh shit, ROOTBEER HATES ME!!!!BRB!!
how you doing BronyInstrumental
alexxm: The movie? I don't know. The fanfic? It's okay at best.
true but, report cards are coming out and i dont know how good/bad ive done and mom likes using the ground hammer on me....alot
Phase4 Ive heard some bad things about scaling ruby, especially with the issues twitter had with its growing stages.
I'm good, alexxm, pretty tired. You?
http://youtu.be/dAa6bOWB8qY MUST WATCH http://youtu.be/dAa6bOWB8qY
insolent fool ,rootbeer is incapable of hate, it's the necter of the gods!
woah double linked
/me yawns
sorry about that
alexxm: The fanfic is overrated but it's still a good fanfic to read.
i'm good BronyInstrumental
Sleepy LadyCanary is sleepy :3
=_=
Brad[Laptop], i've read about those too, tbh i've not used ruby for web dev, BerryPunch is written in ruby and its been fun working with it
Phase4 whats berrypunch?
irc bot
/me gives LadyCanary a box
/me throws the box at Bronysith
Ohi LadyCanary
Phase4 the thing I dislike about php is that it doesn't thread as a cli app
ello there LadyCanary
LadyCanary looks so cute when shes sleepy
LadyCanary: there were muffins in the box
...:I
Ponies47 sleepy BronyInstrumental-using-a-phone is also quite sleepy =_=
LadyCanary: Did you see the new Arrow, black canary surrogate promo?
You dont even know what I look like.
Brad[Laptop], not sure what you meen
...Wait.
Phase4 I wrote a irc bot framework in php, but the problem is it doesnt thread, so its not as efficent as I would like.
BronyInstrumental: It's only 6:38 PM here :P
i know
NO. NOT DINAH. NOT MY WIFE.
Unnr|Riding: Link. Now.
/me Wonders if Bstate works on his phone
LadyCanary: One sec, will PM
7:43 here
Ponies47 try 0:40 AM for me =_=
Good morning everypony.
Hai PillowPoni
BronyInstrumental: 0:40 AM? :p
b state doesnt work on my ipod , wish it did though
6:39pm here
Hai BronyInstrumental
Phase4 PHP doesnt allow you to multithread apps, your code runs lineraly (sp?)
It's soon 2.00 AM here
evening Rommulus
Yeah

moring Rommulus
hi
Still sick :(
Hey Rommulus
Brad[Laptop], also worth a read http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/ , its a helpful resource as well as critique
Phase4 theres a huge anti-php community out there :P but also a huge pro-php community
Ponies47: 0:40 =12:40 am

tSparx: Hello! :)
Ponies47 sorry :( *hugs*
Ponies47 ikr
hi tSparx
AJIsAwesome :P
hi
So so far today I've learned that God is neither omniscient nor omnipotent. Damn, really gonna have to reconsider this thing :P
this religion* thing
wheres shizuka when u need him
13him?
AJIsAwesome: Some girl was being anyoing as (squee) today. She wouldn't shut up! :[
scout19_tf2: Her*
Ponies47 highschool girls are the pinnacle of developed human behavior and knowlege.
*her
Oh, no.............

Ponies47 its okaie whats wrong?
How do you use the trout command?
scout19_tf2 and just to prevent more confusion, Sumica is a guy
yea thanks fer fillin me in
scout19_tf2: Though it's okay, I have such a hard time remembering things like that that I've made a script to say this:
:gender
CCCP: Oh just some girl wouldn't shut up. She wouldn't stop talking!
Ope, well, it didn't work, haha
guys no mattrer what tSparx says im omnipotent ok
Now I've learned that I need to fix that :P
Ponies47 its a highschool girl. they never shutup.
Brad[Laptop]: True! :D
PillowPoni: I'm gonna have to ask you to stand still :P
Ponies47 awww, but they wernt mean we're they?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zB2TfFH5j4&feature=related
tSparx, why?
So I told Mike my idea of how to cure my chest pain without him actually having to hear my heart.,...
CCCP: Not but it just was OMG this! and OMG that! It's like SHUT THE BUCK UP! I'm trying to eat lunch!
PillowPoni: I've gotten like six leave/join messages from you in the last few minutes -- but I don't really care, just something I say to mess with people :)
What's your idea?
Ponies47 don't worry, after highschool, only a select few will act like that
Ponies47 im sorry :(
brb gotta got to lunch cya everypony
Later scout19_tf2
Dken2021: True.
Dken2021: What the hell college do you go to? I should enroll :$
i talk too much in lunch... :s
Ponies47 after highschool, 95% of them dont act that way anymore.
CCCP: It's ok
tSparx; lolol silly. When i talk on my phone it takes me off the wifi
Brad[Laptop]: Good :P
That I steth myself with my ipod and he tells me he hears it when obviously he doesn't .w.
Ponies47 the 5% that do you want nothing to do with.
PillowPoni: It happens :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM
tSparx, that it does
Brad[Laptop]: Exactly
Ponies47 eventually they discover highschool was nothing but an illusion and nothing they learned socially really matters in the real world.
A solid 40% of the girls at my school still act like that -- admittedly, about 3/4ths of those women are underclassmen, but still, annoying, haha
Oh, and guys have only gotten more annoying >_>
Highschool is pointless you learn more looking through a trash can
it is mostly freshman thaty act like that anyway
CCCP agreed.

They only post B state when we're streaming new episodes
Anypony here have a Smartphone? I'm thinking about getting one. Does the chat work on them?
this site usually gets coverage when there's new episodes streaming

Ouch!
Here is a noob question: I recently bought CS: GO and everytime I aim at someone, they kill me, I see their health bar and it looks like they did not take any damage. Now the question is how do you aim? In other words, how do I become good at CS? I know standing still makes your aim better and crouching is the best way to aim, but they are not taking damage. I need some pro tips.
*use
Dat wall
Sorry
Yes

AJIsAwesome: Oh you weren't lying. Sorry, my life of Internet browsing has led me to believe that I was about to run into a wall of sound xD

i prefer silversun pickups lazy eye for relaxation
CrimsonPhoenix: I've heard this song. It's very nice to listen to.
CrimsonPhoenix: i just meant that it was funny. :D

Pony Anthology 2
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh yeah, that. :D
No stream?

AJIsAwesome XD
hi
http://youtu.be/AtxaGSSYetA Dr Dissonance with some Zelda
DocSane: I feel that a lot of people thought "Oh, dubbing over ponies, that's funny!" and no, by itself, that is not funny, it's *what* you dub over the ponies that makes it funny haha
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQ0CraHMKc&feature=plcp
tSparx: PA2 is still clever and well-produced, but there's just too much of it.
DocSane: like I said, it's still great :D
Any of you bronies here play minecraft?
twilight_sprinkle: I like PC and console. I'm just lucky that I got this gaming laptop as my High School graduation gift.
CrimsonPhoenix: Wow, this is pretty good. :O
Dr Dissonance is awesome
CrimsonPhoenix: Thanks for showiing me him. This is very nice. :O
AJIsAwesome, just listen to his steampunk pony music

/me sees skyrim talk "Skyrim? where!?!"
StupidSexyCJ: Not Cj Rhine, by any chance? Friend of mine, uses that name sometimes.
Oh and hi StupidSexyCJ xD
brony2447: i rather get Fallout than Skyrim. I loved Fallout 3 and New Vegaas but i see no point in buying another game on a different system.
o hai tSparx , and no sorry

StupidSexyCJ: No need to apologize, just curious :)
I wish I had gotten a gaming PC for my graduation
brony2447: Maybe i'll do it just for pinkie lol
the tune was a nice mix of Zelda and Metroid
I got a car that ended up never getting used for reasons
CrimsonPhoenix: METROID??!!! WHERE??
I, also, could imagine the lost woods in ruined and all
brony2447, it's not Metroid persay but http://youtu.be/AtxaGSSYetA
twilight_sprinkle: I agree but what i play on my xbox is Halo, Gears, CoD, battlefield, Need for Speed, SSX, and other games that PC does not have.

Wait, which one of these turns into T-Sparx, the first or second: :S :$
Behold the awesome majesty of the original crystal pony story.
What is with G3 comics?
G1 comics, actually.
DocSane: Wow. :D
What did I tell you? AJ totally kills that guy.
more explanation on mah choice "what have you done?, its too early for everyone" refers to when im selfish and go on ahead and leave my team or friend
No seriously this is important, which one? :P
tSparx: The second
DocSane: Oh good, thanks, it means I've been using the proper one this whole time. I'm not on the embed client, so it's just a colon and a dollar sign to me :$

so prince dari, I heard EQD is selling adspace c/d? :)
really? they had to make an article that explained they were just talking about a chair?
By the way, for an amazing time, check out http://heckyeahponyscans.tumblr.com/
sure it was odd for a pony related site, but still
You will see more G1 pony murder than you know what to do with.
we don't hear much form the G1 fans
*from
did chat derp?
nope just me
I think most make G4 fans chase the G1 fans away.
The more I see of it, the more I realize just how outright weird G1 was.
slow chat? or ded Chat?
Des

AJIsAwesome: here is a basic tutorial http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO_8SLUpUWc
CrimsonPhoenix: That this Hatsun lady doesn't need to be real to have fans
bored :/
tSparx, I don't mind her having fans...I do mind her being considered a Pop Star
it's a computer generated voice
I consider Pinkie Pie a pop star -- haven't you heard her latest single, "So Watch out!"
it's autotune in its purest of form
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NylmdC_uEM
CrimsonPhoenix: That's how i feel too, but her music sounds pretty good.
tSparx, I really do not see what you're trying to do in your arguments
for the giggles
guess im the only survivor :(
survivor of what?
CrimsonPhoenix: Forgive me, sometimes I mean to deliver a joke but do it in the form of an argument instead.
on accident*
flutterchu: The link is not working
what is the "My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic: Adventures In The Crystal Empire" dvd supposed to be? a collection of previously aired episodes right and not something new?
listening to music

Sketch_Toku_Brony, any new music?
any new enemies?
Who here is addicted to TV Tropes?
CrimsonPhoenix: Nope
CrimsonPhoenix: how in the hell didi that happen... she's... she's just a program for petes sake
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0l28Qmj9MY&feature=related
CrimsonPhoenix: i like this song
Garettbrony: NOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Spectrum_Rush, your guess is as good as mine
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm guessing the fact that we as human beings were able to create something as amazing as this and were able to breath life and personality into a computer program.
ghost houses and castle i think new music,some new enemies mostly castle one like bone goomba and pirahnna plant
Garettbrony: Drugs are Bad for you!!!
it's how SHE HAS A CONCERT
Sketch_Toku_Brony dear lord so much coins
i dont like my guess CrimsonPhoenix ._.
CrimsonPhoenix: I would recommend doing some research into it.
ikr Dken2021 :D
back :d
though that concert thing was pretty neat, with the holograms and such
AJIsAwesome, into what exactly
i love chatting but if something dosnt stream soon im going to leave :/
I've seen enough with her
13waa
CrimsonPhoenix: It's kind of hard to explain, really. It's best if you do research about her. But hey, to each his own.
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh yeah that's right. The only new enemies I can think of are Dry versions of Goombas and Pirhana Plants. But unlike Dry Bones you can kill them with the Raccoon Tail
brb
Shizuka: What was so funny at the end? I'm not getting it :/
/me reingages lurkmode
CrimsonPhoenix: Like I said, research it.
Dovah Tv Tropes isnt A drug http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic

Garettbrony: .... why did you link that!!?!?! now i have to wast hours of my life!!!
CrimsonPhoenix: I can't really tell you anymore. I don't really know how to explain it, really.

AJIsAwesome, you act as if there's something I do not know
Dovah: Tara Strong? :$
and it sort of gets on my nerves a bit
CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaA2liN9LKM I think this is really stupid
Tara Strong is batman, No joke
I know
The programmers of Vocaloid must be billionaires by now
Sega
CrimsonPhoenix: I guess people become attached to it, I don't know. Like,I said, I can't explain it.
I think it was Yamaha

ohai Klumzeedragon
Hai FlutterMEDIC
mrow
hi FlutterMEDIC
Hi FlutterMEDIC
This game is pretty infamous for being a button masher,right?
Hey FlutterMEDIC
Scoot-Scootaloo: Yeah. I remember. I'm the one who told you to go out with a bang the last time. :) How are things?
hi FlutterMEDIC
yes

Scoot-Scootaloo: School sucks :<
00,03Also, don't ask me why I knew that...
I'm never gunn get rid of this chest pain .o.
Scoot-Scootaloo: i forget, are you in high school or college?
Well, God of War implies it's the first game when it clearly isn't. Is this God of War 2? God of War 3?
Scoot-Scootaloo: Any fun or interesting classes at lease?
School! Who made THAT up? :|

Keldeo Fainted! Kratos gained 638 experience points! lol

Hi cow334

Have fun Scoot......
I don't think I've heard that one before.
I am so slow :/
Shizuka feel like playing mvm ?
See ya then Scoot-Scootaloo.
so what is that mountain thing?
if nothing works, close and reopen page/brewser or use a diffferent browser
Backerooni. But still no stream... >_>
13don't know...
13feeling very bleh today..
Nah, just kidding with ya XD
Looking at two streams at once this, and NTom playing Banjo-Tooie over at Hellfire Comms
God, this game is also freaking awesome...
i know
:D
oh look, its a brony
huh, what happened to the shiny gold blades from the first game?
There was a time when I would get a lot of bladder infections. My mom had a friend who was a doctor. She would call this friend and ask him for some medicine. The bladder infections kept coming back until she finally TOOK ME TO a doctor.
No it's Iron Will
tired perhaps ? yo should sleep if so
oh shit iron will
And how about that ear infection?
He's not a monster, he's a minotaur!
So...wait, if the bronies are like that... *looks at my lower half* FAWK YEAH!
twiligh_sprinkle , my faithful student!
don't remember Iron Will beinga centaur
sure
I need to get on someones head....
13not tired just.. bleh...
13can't enjoy anything..
D'oh
its nice how they wait for you to finish your fatality thing
yeah
Lol kratos be going against iron will
/me jumps onto Dken2021's head randomly
JESmith71, trying to juggle this stream with PSO2. Meanest Client Order yet. Not only do I have to clear a mission with an S rank in 15 minutes, it's one that ends in a Collect Code, hunting down Rare Minerals at the last minute.
Dken2021: Got my mythical creatures mixed up
/me noms muffin "whassup docs"
so dken2021 how is life in the year 2021
Speaking of which, I have the PS3 version of MK9, Kratos inculded.
Refreshing my stream isnt working either. 6_9 Why you no work for me?
/me tries and balance cutenesskitteh on head
/me ish being balanced
Ohai cachi01|phone nothing much
Do I need to sacrifice something?
Klumzeedragon: try reopening page or browser. or try different browser
God don't know, it's all wet
never fear, seapony lyra will save up
us*
Kaaaaay.
why does that huge monster sound like a girl
And it DOES have to be at the last minute, because I gotta kill enough monsters to qualify for an S ranking. And the Collect Code tends to be time consuming.
this pony scares me
/me looks around suspiciously
if you see a sighn that say's say no to crack and it remind's you to put your pant's back up..........you might be a redneck
:P
Now if only Neverrealm Studios can ask Rare to make a Mortal Kombat VS Killer Instinct title...
VenHur that would be awesome
I had a horrible ear infection that was so bad, I couldn't get up. I'd fall just going from my bed to the toilet. I was just laying in my bed, constantly crying, unable to hear for so long. My mom kept assuming she knew what was wrong. She just kept buying eardrops that weren't working. Finally she took me to the doctor after a while.
that would totally be awesome
Hello everypony~ :) I am back and the stream now works. Thanks twilight_sprinkle.
WOAH WHAT THE BUCK IZ DIS THING
uhmm everyone have some of those days, try doing something you always like :3
what is that - horse + crab + scorpion?
some kind of spider pony
WB Klumzeedragon
flutterchu bronystate
one time i took one of those pshycology tests to see if i was crazy and it said i was
13there really isn't anything..
i thought it was like horse+spider+snake+water
cachi01|phone: no the boss
I needed a pill to go with the eardrops because there was water behind my eardrum .__.
Oh lol
does that rock thing behind it make it part turtle?
Nighty night everypony
that suckd
nighty lowfm
nite lowfn_Sleeping
Night lowfn_Sleeping
Night lowfn :)
bye lowfn_Sleeping
night lowfn_Sleeping
Suddenly Seapony Lyra
Ill sleep to the sound of ping
night lowfn_Sleeping
Night lowfn_Sleeping
night lowfn_Sleeping
seapony lyra is the true enemy kratos
Lyra wants to talk to that spiderpony
Potato-pony.... Huh. That reminds me.
Lyra plushie is best pencil holder
sea lyra look out...theres a big horse crap thing behind you!
Or shoe
Now the only promblem with making a MK VS KI game is the story of the KI roster, and they're fatalities...
poor lyra needs that bucket to do anything atleast she's happy O.u.O
Or glove
*crab
cutenesskitteh: of?
/me eats some potato chips
cachi01|phone: And pencil sharpener.
...
Problem?
COCA COLA WITH BACON MMMMMMMMMM
VenHur they did it with DC they can do it with KI
I feel like a durp.... I wasnt getting any sound then i realized my speakers wherent on :'(
All of a sudden, titan.
cutenesskitteh: not at all *eats kittens*
potato_pony: O_o
QuinnThePegaSistta: awww its ok...we all do that so times lol
/me eats potato_pony
If my mom ever takes me to the doctor for this, I'll have completely lost my voice. ._____.
lol
If there's one thing that video games in general suggest, it's not that size doesn't matter. Size DOES matter, but only so much as the giant monster is at a disadvantage.
Is that possible? o_o
cachi01|phone: Oh, that was a strange crossover game, but still enjoyable...too bad that game only has an T rating...
every......body......leiks........applez......
dah fucq
tbh i dont get why giants are slow, i would think their muscles would be proportional to their size
Stab the heart!!
VenHur looks like they're making it up with injustice: gods among us
And to any australlians that is on Bronystate, i'm sorry that you didn't get the game, darn contenversials.
DRINK THAT YOU MOTHER FUCKER
Mmm. I has tacos. :)
Tacos???
/me still eating potato chips
bein a brony's a good hobby mate
Australia literally censors everything....
cachi01|phone: does it censor censors?
Anyways. I have to go to bed tomorrow for SCHOOL. Good night everypony
QuinnThePegaSistta: Homemade tacos. Yush. :P
kinda sucks for them, dang government

U need to taste real mexican tacos! THIS ARE THE TACOS ALL TRUE WARRIORS STRIVE FOR!
hey pudge you on for movie night?
So, why not also called MK10 Mortal Kombat 2? Hell, they rebooted the story of the first three games.
FlutterMEDIC: I'm officially freaked out
Garettbrony: i'll be on around 10ish I work friday
Venhur cause mindfuck
I've never heard of anyone eating kittens, I have heard of similar unrelated horrible things to cuteness
cachi01|phone: TACOS! FOR EVERYPONY!
Pudge thats a crime against bronyianity
*tacos start raining from the sky*
O_o I don't think I should be a kitten/cat anymore...

Hi BroHoof

Posiden?

So the story of the series in a nutshell is: Kratos family died, Kratos bows to kill the gods, blah blah blah blah blah.
this game seems a bit to teenager-oriented to me tbh
/me has a random hammer in her paws
I guess cratos is having a poseiden adventure
*vows
funfact: Posiden created horses
/me hugs BroHoof back
/me hugs BroHoof back.

Pudge: its Poseiden, God of the Seas. its SUPPOSED to be hard
GOD OF WAR......is this the I or the III?
Oh the III
Cratos should call upon the sea poniez
FlutterMEDIC: I guess

/me Hello, this is Hades, the God of Death, hello how you're doing?
cachi01|phone: ok we wont >_>
FUUUUUUUUUU
Hades is awesome dude
I wonder how he'd react if I suddenly stopped replying to him, stayed off tumblr and facebook for a while and never commented on his videos
cachi01|phone: y u missing?
huh, Kratos sounds like a whiny bitch...
twilight_sprinkle: MORE like the souls inside them
6Yeah,sorry,I'm back xD
i killed you, and i aint gonna apologize
twilight_sprinkle cause im about to take a bath and my mom is using the ps3 lol
6C4? You wanna make me a bomb? xD
i hate the main character, kratos is such a douche
i wish hed just die
AND fetch quest commence
he did
I'd seriously do that if it weren't for the fact that I seriously DIE when we don't talk for long
Then he revived
Then he died again
Then he revived....
MY KIDNEY!
cachi01|phone: its dbz all voer again!

false alarm *phew*
Presumed dead......

Hades was so red in the first game
Buytoast: Well excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse him/her Buytoast!
DJ_POn-3: that stuff is true that's how i learned englih lawl
and bloody
don't excuse that asshammering cheese monkey
i wish they would have released this on 360 so i wouldnt have to buy a ps3
but oh well
deep voices mean we're tough...
THAT WOULD MAKE A GOOD tumblr
Ok, Buytoast i don't know what you guys are arguing about......i hope i never find out why
call upon the chees ponies
I has to wonder though, if Kratos killed all of the gods in the world, won't he be the only God that lived? Won't he just realised it by now and commit an suicide attempt?
this game should have a teen-meter and teen points
BroHoof: i am still trying to learn to type in russian i keep typing in traditional english QWERTY which i dislike how i do this
zecora warn's the main 6 will have a cheese addiction
http://www.tickld.com/images/content/23863.jpg
DJ_POn-3: russian can be har ;P
eh, he's just some ass that links youtube links and shit all the time during streams because he think's he's hot shit
DJ_POn-3: hard*
DJ_POn-3: you mean like так?
BroHoof: ya can ya teach me
yup, rope combat still broken as ever
DJ_POn-3: i would if i could speak it >_<
Buytoast: who?
I mean, I know he's the GHOST of Sparta, but he's cleary "isn't" a ghost...
DJ Asshat over there
*clearly
BroHoof: you can type it but not speak it?

matt : im....... a vampire............om nomnomnomnomnom
Bronami: god of war threee
Pudge: ya i am a regular here

Buytoast: why am i a selfish git?
I was just playing amnesia for the last 3 hours so I need some Brony love for a while
I'm going to go.
Bye everypony
didn't he already kill medusa?
here we o
how's it going Bronami?
Buytoast: those are lamias
These are Gorgons
Buytoast: they're just regular gorgans
Buytoast: Unless this is an servant of Medusa.
Medusa is ONE gorgon
well i know medusa was gorgon, but i didn't know they all looked like that
Good. I was just playing The Small Horse. It is a scary amnesia custom story with ponies.
ill be right back i half to read the scedule
Gorgons looks more snake-like, and shiny
i figured they were some sort of ox like creature
oh my bad
and that medusa was just a high ranking one
Dken2021: what about Gordons?
where was gordon when ____?
im back
gondor*
i was thinking more of hl, but thats fine too
I'm back. Stupid computer died. :|
also you're a selfish git because you link all your shit during people's streams and do it constantly
wb AJIsAwesome
The God of War Vs. Fluttershy... we all know who would win.

Ok.
Hey, in your epert brony opinions, where, other than the internet, is the most common place for brony presence?
:(

And im back :)
hello cachi01|phone
Bronami: Any convention anywhere.
Also: evening, all.
flutterchu let the bodies hit the....... FLOOOOOOOOOOOR
Bronami: Conventions and Meetups, IMO.
where does he keep the bow and the sword anyway?
hi Reikim!
Reikim: Hi! :)
hoi Reikim
cachi01|phone: that song's pretty annoying
I have no meetups in my area. Thats why I asked
twilight_sprinkle: Where Sonic keeps his Chaos Emeralds.
hi Reikim
Today I have realized something.
There is a point where you go past being tired.
6>.<
flutterchu its overused.but good imo :)
You become so tired that being tired becomes a non-issue and suddenly everything is clear again.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Inky Pie / Apple Bloom Learns The Family Business / Surprise Visit
inkie was alot better in ask the crusaders
Yup
AJIsAwesome: OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH
Inky, Blinky, Pinkie and Clyde.
And then Sue, the mother.
yet more fanon bullshit i presume
AJIsAwesome: If you mean by name and not apperance, then yeah.
I also learned
I become strangely chatty when tired to this point.
DID YOU know that pipsqueak appears in the backround of putting your hood down
sup everypony
hi OohShiny

flutterchu: Actually, I did. They did a freeze frame of it.
hi OohShiny!
I see we're watching GoW 3
hood lol
OohShiny: Hello! :)
ooooooooohhhhhhhh shhhiiiiiinnnnyyyyyy OuO
the soundtrack didn't even change huh?
who's playing?
Caramel:
interesting, never saw him on chat
OohShiny: some game on the gaystation
OohShiny: then you aren't paying attention
bpy, this movie sure is engrossing
and Flutterchu: if you're a fanboy, keep it to yourself
PARKUAH
Caramel: Not actually, I enter the chat just once a week
flutterchu seems hyper today/
Klumzeedragon: ..........T~T
okay, this soundtrack is good
G2G to sleep. Goodnight everypony :)
Caramel: You bastard. I've got Gunleon's theme permanently etched into my brain now. I hope you're happy.
cachi01|phone: Night! :)

Klumzeedragon: oh wait never mind youre wright i drank 6 CAN'S OF COKE AND BACON for edd

night DJ_POn-3
DJ_POn-3: Nighty night~. :)
night DJ_POn-3
im sure it will stop when a thunderstorm comes
flutterchu: See. I knew it. :P
I see zombies... In the underworld?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Married Again
OohShiny: It makes sense damn it!
no it doesn't
Don't look so surprised.
zombies are physical
in the underworld there is mostly souls
Everyone knows the underworld is full of zombies for the express purpose of messing with you.
Also: someone hasn't read the Inferno.
Reikim: But there are other monsters in the underworld
like ghouls
and ghosts? lol GnG
Well
Depends on which Underworld you're talking about.
I'm talking about Hades
The Greek one?
yes
Which area are we in?
Hades
/me note: cannot see stream
Hades was split in three.
yes
Which area are we in?
Elisiukm
oh
we are in tartarus
I think
I thought this was GoW? Or so the chat said.
or the gates of erebos
this is GoW...3
ohey its iron will
Gates of Elysium or some shit
Reikim: Yes, it's GoW
Reikim, no I'm not
Hades do not have zombies
Okay, then hell I don't know
they have skeletons
I blame artistic license.
Or just plain Not Caring.
Actually, let's go with that last one.
Hardly anyone tries to get an actual, accurate portrayal of Hell anymore.
the 3 judges, nice
king minos is one son of a bitch
Addendum: I thought GoW was concerned with mutants from below the planet's crust. When did they fall into Hell?
beyond that door, waits your NEEEEEW CAAAAAR
I have an epic nosdrip from crying lol
OMG A Gian Rock!
why is king minos one of the judges anyway? he was a pussy in the greek mythology
Pfft, that's just a roc-OH MY GOD, ANOTHER GIANT ROCK!
and I know he was one of the judges too
twilight_sprinkle lol the three judges Bob Barker,Drew Carey and Pat Sayjack :D
Because, like I said, they probably mixed up everything.
Reikim: King Minos is actually one of the judges
There's probably more of the Inferno in here than actual Grecian mythology.
Ah
You're wondering why, in Greek mythology, he became a judge?
thats a lotta iron will clones
yes
Supposedly after his many misadventures he actually figured out how to be a decent kind of guy and reigned rather nicely for a while.
love it how the other one just sits there and lets you kill his friend lol
haha
He was just enough that the Gods decided to reward him by making him a judge of the damned.
Reikim: And died by the hands of Daedalus' vengeance
Maybe it's just me, but that seems like a real shitty reward...
I'm guessing these monsters can only be killed by takedowns, right?
How far into the game is this?
I don't remember how Minos died, how did it happen again?
magmablock: a bit after kratos kills poseidon and falls straight into hell
magmablock: this is how to play :D
aight, so fairly early
Reikim: Daedalus used some kind of herb that absorbed the king
...What?
like, he put plant seed in the king's bath, they growed and entangled him
then absorbed him
Nine bits says he got it from some god.
and the chat died
sounds like some kinky ass shit
Nope.
woah Phase4 i didnt know you were online you usually talk much
Still alive.
immmm back wus up everypony
scout19_tf2: Welcome back. :)
sup scout19_tf2
hi scout19_tf2
OohShiny: Who were the other three judges?
Reikim: I don't remember
just remember minos
flutterchu, yeah, i've been less active due to my inability to recive stream
so wut happend while i was gone
imma be gone for a bit, peace
ha, was that a letter from that salty old bastard from the first game?
why do i have an urge to play God of War
BroHoof: because it's awesome
OohShiny: true
/me Tip hoofs back into chat in his PJ's
dis part of the soundtrack
wb Ponies47 :)
Eh, I never really did the GoW thing.
I do remember when it came out, though.
thelonepony: I shoudl be in bed :$
*should
Reikim: If I remember correctly, the first one was 2004 right?
I pretty much dismissed it as violence for the sake of violence. Granted, I was pretty damn biased back then.
Hell if I know, I just remember seeing it in a store and walking right by.
The game literally had no interest for me. I still don't know why.
well, I played all of them, except 3
even the PSP ones
Reikim: yeah but it is violence for violences sakr
There were PSP ones?
wut game is this
yes
The hell
Brb shower
Chain of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta
God of War scout19_tf2
scout19_tf2: God of War 3
...
the latter being my favorite of the series
.................
Well.
oh cool
Well fuck.
Huh
I thought GoW meant GEARS of War.
...
oh no
lol
both
it's God of War
Oh god I'm too tired to be awake still.
Anyway, GoW DID hold interest for me.
I just never got around to playing it.
are you talking about Gears or God?
God
god of war is too teenagy for me, and too much pointless violence, and the main hero is a douche
You know what fuck acronyms
twilight_sprinkle: Same here. I NEVER found the interest in the game.
In my opinion, Kratos is the villain in all this
God of War is kind of outside my field, really.
magmablock: he is
Not my thing.
In my opinion, there is no hero in Greek Mythology
Never really paid much attention to it.
I would consider him an anti-hero, IMO.
how about darksiders anyone like that game
Greek definition of a hero?
back
BroHoof: i did
Reikim: Someone that did great deed for humanity
Anyone know of anything that helps get rid of headaches? I have a really bad one and I took two Advil but it didnt help
Because in Greek Mythology there are plenty of heros. They're all just assholes/stupid/incompetent.
totally
NocturnalBlade: it's a pretty good game it has a good character and a good story too
that's why I said there's no hero
Thus the concept of Tragic Hero, which I am sick to my teeth of.
oni_link: Tylenol, maybe?
oni_link: Don't know what to tell you. I usually just take a pill and lie down and that's enough for me
BroHoof: yea...and it has Mark Hamel lol
Title on www.bronystate.net: Brony Fan Fair Podcast Schedule (or PS, BFF) | BronyState
Achilles took an arrow to the knee or something
It's called a Tragic Hero, OohShiny, it's very common, the Greeks invented it, and I have spent way too much of my past time becoming familiar with it.
magmablock: I dont have any unfortunately.
YAY
BS POST
NocturnalBlade: yea xP
JESmith71: maybe i should just lie down for a bit. I have to study later on for my learners permit though,
oni_link just sleep it off
god of agent smiths
Hephaestus
oh noo its a giant man
I am quite literally sick to my teeth of the tragic hero.
nice
badass voice
yeah i think thats what I need to do thelonepony
13you have to study for a learners permit, seriously?
Brb guys, I need a shower.
Shizuka: Up here you do.
Shizuka: ikr!
Shizuka: Tests of all kinds make me nervous.
The test is absolutely retardedly easy.
Shizuka: you do have to take a test you know
but its easy
Zeus threw Hephaestus out of olympus, Zeus is a douche
It actually takes effort to fail the test for a G1 in Ontario.
OohShiny: We know. It would be easier to list the number of things that Zeus has done that do not qualify him for douchehood. I'm a fan of doing nothing.
In a lot of ways, Zeus is actually more of a jackass than his father was.
yeah
Hades is actually a good guy
For one thing, I'm pretty sure Chronus didn't have sex with everything under the sun (and then some)
oh man look at that action
Hades isn't a good guy.
not definitly 'good'
He's just not his brothers.
walking slowly i ncircles
i cant take this action
but he was betrayed by his brothers
Hades is notable because he doesn't actually do anything.
He looks good next to his brothers.
Hades strikes me as the kind of guy who's just doing his job. He is a bit of a callous motherfucker, though
Well either way, Im gonna take your advice and take a nap so I can try and shake off this headache. Ill see you all later :P
00,03twilight_sprinkle: Too MLG for you?
Hades just takes care of the souls
Pretty much, yeah.
Scoot-Scootaloo: absolutely
He's also, in theory, the most powerful of the three.
bye oni_link
Reikim: and he don't even complain
Damn straight.
twilight_sprinkle :3
Hades is a chill kind of guy.
bye oni_link sleep well
is kratos dead right now or did he just get ported to underworld?

HAWL SHEET DAT COMBO!
Panda|Drawing: im ok, minus Federer losing yesterday :( what about you?
Reikim: And that's why I say Hades is a good guy.
Hades is a damn chill guy and is my first choice of Greek god to hang with.
twilight_sprinkle D: im good, just started class today >.< and uh... whats on the stream?
Panda|Drawing: god of war 3
Panda|Drawing: God Of War 3
Every other deity in the Greek pantheon is basically an asshole. EXCEPT maybe Prometheus, but he's a Titan.
twilight_sprinkle D: who is streaming?
Reikim: He's not part of the pantheon too
Panda|Drawing: caramel
This is why I said.
Titan.
I don't think any other Greek god manages to be nice.
twilight_sprinkle should have known ^^ im not watchign the stream currently >.>
haha doctor hooves is taking a nap
Caramel
that is not Dr Whooves
00,03Doctor hooves....
Panda|Drawing: too busy?
Really?
Hades don't do anything, neither bad nor good. Prometheus gave humans the Fire... Yeah, that's it
00,03How about Doctor Caramel?
twilight_sprinkle D: drawing :3
Pretty much.
But the Greeks...
Tragic Heros.
God damn tragic heros.
well they look the same from dis distance

okaaaay?

This is a prawn-free chat.
superretroworld: only cause low def stream
There are no miniature crustacean things in this chat.
oh
I would know because if there were I would cook them, barbecue them, and eat them.
Badass Boss Incoming... probably
Who's he going to fight?
Hades
Reikim: Hades...i think
Wait
We've said Hades is a good guy.
I know that
What about that fiasco involving Demetre?
And her daughter?
but Kratos is the bad guy
and Kratos cares about that why
Hades voice is awesome
I'm bringing something up into a conversation that ended several minutes ago.
Fun fact: Hades is voiced by Clancy Brown, aka Mr. Krabbs
Hades did, once, fuck up everything.
magmablock HOLY FUCK!
magmablock: Lol
And Lex Luthor
they always say u wont get away but u always do
magmablock: i thought he sounded familiar
cannot unhear
Reikim: the Kraken?
God of War?
OohShiny: What's her name...starts with a P. Demeter's daughter.
XylemTube: eeyup
Cool!
Back from mah shower
Kidnapped her, then tricked her into eating Underworld fruit, then she was bound there.
Hopping between Harpes like a boss
wb Ponies47
Reikim: There is also the Andromeda fiasco
Demeter was so upset she stopped caring about the world and winter happened.
wb Ponies47
Was Andromeda Hades?
no
I thought Andromeda was Neptune?
Um
Damn, roman name
Poseidon
00,03Persephone
Yes!
Persephone.
00,03Per See Phon Eee
Hades didn't fucked up that
00,03Thats how you say it
Yeah he did.
He kidnapped her.
Persephone just ate the fruit
He kidnapped her first.
Then he tricked her into eating it.
00,03She was kidnapped from her mother Ceres
By, you know, not warning her in advance.
Demeter.
Greek names, Scoots.
00,03:|
Dammit I gotta type slower.
Oh dear. I just realized both of my cats are in my room O_O
kitteh spies :3
Ponies47: holy shiz man, run!
00,03Anyways, she swallowed 6 seeds and so Demeter made a deal with Hades
So anyway, Shiny, Hades kidnapped Persephone, she gets trapped there, Demeter freezes over the world.
And then deal.
Which Scoots will outline.
Reikim: not actually, hades gave persephone on spring
/me hugs Reikm
One of them is growling at the other ;~;
OohShiny: Scoots will explain.
aaand boss
kratosbob swordpants, yer late fer werk!
00,03Persephone would be allowed to stay with her mom for six months and return to the underworld for the rest
welcome back my friends to the chat that never ends, were so glad you could attend, come inside come inside. be ready when you can theres the bronies that love and tolerance, so come and join the herd, comin join comin join
Thus the seasons were born.
INB4 Cat fight (literally)
00,03During that time, Demeter says screw you world and freezes it
Woman really loves her daughter.
Demeter could be a good goddess
Kind of funny, because most parents can't wait to be rid of their children ASAP.
OohShiny: isnt she already a goddess?
Anyway: UND THAN THE SEASONS WERE BORN.
emphasis on good
Demeter's in the same boat as Hades in that she really isn't a jackass but doesn't do anything spectacular either.
superretroworld I meant she could be good, she's already a goddes
She does throw a hissyfit for half the year, though.
that's her rage
Hissyfit.
oh
cya everypony i gotta go got school tommorow c u all at movie night
bye scout19_tf2
nice, what's a Hissyfit? not an english speaker
bye scout19_tf2
Nighty night scout19_tf2 :)
You know when you get a kid and they're being really whiny?
Being all cranky and stomping around and snapping at everyone?
Hissyfit.
I would have a headache
but thanks for the explanation
I learned a new world today
word
new word*
So Demeter's not really a jackass so much as she is the epitome of every over-protective mother everywhere.
im turning 17 ans i still have trouble with definitions and new words
dinner was great/hello everypony
hi flutterchu
hello flutterchu
hi flutterchu
Interesting that in games, a boss tells you to come in, obviosly waiting for you, but instead you have to go through a lot of crazy shit to fight him for real
Ah, puzzles
As Duke Nukem once said... "I hate valve puzzles."
I remember the infinite red orb glitch
in the first game
VenHur: so in general, he hates the game portal? your kidding me
Good times
such good times not long ago
maxing out Artemis and the blades and fucking up everything
till you get to Ares
real pain in the ass
Ares is fucked up in god mode
Moo ^.^
superretroworld, it makes sense that Duke Nukem doesn't like playing an FPS where the only gun you get shoots mostly harmless portals.
moo
sooo trine is in discount how about that ?
Meh
Don't even know anything about that one.
finally, the boss
Reikim beutiful art and soundtrack it's worth it
Lovely
How much?
Kandarihu: well its technically not a fps since you dont have a gun, just a porta gun
Even though I'm not going to buy it.
PLAESE tell me this is the final boss
no
Not even close
just hades
Trine Complete Collection 9 bucks
SHITFUCK
a long way to go flutterchue
this like the 2nd boss
Frozenbyte Collection 10 bucks
IT'S
ME!!!
weeee, hades
KICK HIS PLOT ME!
damn, he's fat
hi Stallion_of_War

Meh

Can't afford time
Ahh, the day I killed Hades. Yes, I remember it well.
/me imagines Fluttershy fighting Hades in Tartarus like this :D
OohShiny: what?
Fun fact: Hades has a Lyra plushie in his room.
Coolest attack ever
Well, had, technically
I knew it! My cats are fighting! D:
god of war
Agian! D:
OohShiny: hidan wasnt a god though
a game you may like is called analogue a hate story
JRP: Me of War
twilight_sprinkle: and was a fucking sadomasochist
What?
OohShiny: yeah he was an interesting character
analogue: a hate story i think you may like that game
Caramel: dat interlacing
And the said Haphestus was ugly...
Hades is not ugly, he's badass

DO NOT QUESTION YOUR STALLION OF WAR
by flutterchy
wheres the mare of war?
soul cerberous
What is it?
Well Bye everypony
Ponies47, is he looking out the window?
Pudge: Some Earth Pony trying to kill Celestia?
bye DerpyMuffins
cya DerpyMuffins
bye DerpyMuffins
Princess Luna is in the royal bedcham... :$
bye DerpyMuffins
I WILL QUESTION WHOEVER THE HELL I LIKE I don't even know what's going on
OohShiny: sounds like fanfiction material
TUG of WAR 3
Flutteros V Solar Flare
Pudge: There you have an Idea for a fanfic, I'm not good at writing
Kandarihu: The one growling is a she. They are fighting agian. And the other she is growling is my other cat and he is only a kitten :S
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Cathy Weseluck and Recording of Andrew Francis Interviews
OohShiny: my english teachers tell me I'm a really good writer
ehhh the easiest way to put it would be that is like a visual novel or date simulator
oooo...new weapons!
but the story is quite good
wow
Ladies and Gentalman, the TUG OF WAR!
bad ass weapon
RIP Headphone users, and hi everypony!
Kratos: "Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!"
wee, kratos is back
I mean hades
lol dat Hooker Trophy
and he looks beautiful
Hi XisBestChemical.
The one attack for Hades' hooks looks like some sort of dance move
Acheivement Get: Do something that you have to do in order to beat the game and is therefor a completely uninteresting accomplishment!
hi XisBestChemical
the large-area attack
well i'
Fuck you Hades, you are not in hell
magmablock: There are actually achievements for turning the game on you know.
you're in Hades
I gotta go ponies, got work tomorrow. night all
nite Pudge
wow
magmablock: Not this one, but some
night Pudge
magmablock, not all achievements are meant to be entertaining. Achievements like that are a milestone to let others know how far one has gotten in the main game.
magmablock: At least with 360 games it's an easy point boost
oh, that's how he kills hades
YOUR SOUL....IS MINE!
after 3 hrs of soft reseting Heartgold i finally got a Shiny starter :$
Hades was delicious
Tasted like Chicken
his head will explode!
RUN TO THE HILLS!
twilight_sprinkle: nope
souls be free!!
>soft resetting
the hills have eyes
don't run there
His helmate is down in the water to the left
Caramel
*helmet
I AM THE STALLION OF WAR, NOT OF SPELLING
the sisters of fate were no the sisters of fate, because if kratos killed them, time would simply stop, and world would be doomed
:O
hai LadyCanary
NOBODY IS EXEMPT FROM SPELLING
HEY! God of War! Good choice, Caramel!
00,03Go to sleep, LadyCanary!
NOT EVEN EQUINES OF BATTLE
D: NO SCOOTS.
I dont have school~
Honestly though, Kratos killed Death. What did Zeus expect?
00,03:O
ohai LadyCanary. How do you do?
00,03I do...
00,03:(
Go to sleep Scoot-Scootaloo
I do wonderfully~ my heart is light as air. D: Me sorry Scoots
LadyCanary: I approve
Damnit Lyra

twilight_sprinkle: we i saved before picking my starter, then pushed L+R+Start+Select when ever none of the starters were shiny
i need sleep...
My heart...
Foal, I'm fabulous
o/
I lost that irritating bit of anatomy years ago.
Figured this would fit ^_^
11,02I LIEK PLOT :D
00,03TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I don't supposeyou have extra itmes lying around for TF2... do you?
There really does need to be a remake of this with Fluttershy as Kratos
11,02oops, wrong channel
thelonepony: Maybe you should sleep.......
SuperBrony64: O_O
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii SB64 :3
Thanks to Pit.
SuperBrony64: Oh, you! :P
11,02Haaaaaaaaiiiii LadyAthena :3
The REST of me is tired but my mind is currently floating upon a sea of clouds made of coton candy in space.
Scoot-Scootaloo depends of what item :p
SuperBrony64, I am sure you do :)
Scoot-Scootaloo what are you looking for ?
11,02Scoot-Scootaloo: You getting on so I can give you stuff? :3

Kratos you dick.
I.E Fuck your daughter
I feel bad for him...but...eww...
Scoot-Scootaloo: Night! :)
Night Scoots :3
oh, kryptonite
twilight_sprinkle: you press the buttons when they arnt shiny, so it will take you back to the start screen, then choose your file and see if any of the starters are shiny
Basically :D
Kratos' kryptonite is his daughter
Well, he's an anti-hero. Love or Tolerance.
VenHur: Yep.
twilight_sprinkle: and repeat that process until a shiny appears
OohShiny: It certianly isn't death, fate, betrayal by the gods...
the probability of getting a shiny pokemon is 1/8192
etc.
He does things only for himself and doesn't care about anyone else.
Poor doggies :<
Spectrum_Rush: Until Black 2 White 2. :D
Geordi Theforge?
/me ba dum tsk
AJIsAwesome: whats different?
AJIsAwesome: almost like any other greek hero
twilight_sprinkle: np
Spectrum_Rush: "im different"
Spectrum_Rush: There's a key item you can get that will increase the chances of shiny pokemono.
Brotip: If it moves, kill it.
*pokemon*
The chat is moving?
11,02Stallion_of_War: Protip for Pokemon.
KILL IT
AJIsAwesome wow thats neat
SuperBrony64: :D
Wait, a key item that gets you shinies easier?
That sounds awesome
ikr?
this game is fucking big
its the portal to outland!
...
This makes me want to draw Fluttershy holding the cevered head of a NMM-Styled Celestia
*severed
shineys are special BECAUSE THEY ARE RARE
Caramel: Will you fuck Aphrodite when you get to her minigame?
or w/e
It's the portal to Equestria! :O
fucking kids
AJIsAwesome: you sure im looking at info on shiny pokes and theres no mention of an item like that in B2W2
I usually never like these kinds of games, they sca-
DONT LET HIM INTO EQUESTRIA
lol i remember watchin Chugga get a shiny koffing
so much blood
Athena!
"If I kill you, I will gain health orbs." - Kratos
I'm sorry Zeus.
I'm afraid i'm going to have to kill you.
we get it kratos, you wanna kill him
DUN DUN DUN!
Thus begins the demo
Once my health is low enough, you have my permission to hit circle.
or was that earlier?
Okay, are all giants in this game disgusting?
die Gaia
Oh dear D:
you're fucked Gaia, your death shall be slow and painful
Jesus, what the hell
Wait
He kills GAIA?
But she isn't even Pantheon!
Nope!
OOOOH SNAP
dat lyra
Ironic Echo
weee
Bai.
break her bone
have a nice trip *puts on shades* see you next fall...YEEEAAAAHHH!! :D
lol
Damn Kratos, just...damn.
So God of War can be summed up as follows: Kratos kills shit because he feels like it?
I actually kinda laughed when she fell
-_(\
Slightly disappointing.
Handy Man
he gave her a hand
Reikim: He killed Gaia because she let him die
kratos to Gaia: you can *puts on shades* leaf it to me YEEAAAH
Reikim: Obviously, he came back from the dead
Oh like he needs an excuse to kill her.
Kratos kills Gaia because his personality is "kill things for no reason and be angry all the time."
^
that seems right
GRR
IM ANGRY AND I KILL THINGS
hes basicallly a teenager
lol
Kratos logic has some sense, he wants to kill everything (including humans) that is fucking up the world
twilight_sprinkle: Yep.
kratos is the angry atheist :)
twilight_sprinkle: "You don't understand me, Dad!"
SuperBrony64:
he even kills himself
That...kinda sounds like me, twilight_sprinkle
OMG i just saw this Baby Spike Comercial on the TV
because he fucked up the world
SpeedyBolt: :I
In a more fancy God of War-ish way: "I kill the mortals, they don't stand in my way!"
^
they cant speak normal
Not the doggies :<
they have to use fanceh words
hia guys
god of war?
now that I think about it, Gaia is all earthy, she can be Fluttershy!
yup
hi spartan133t and yea
hi spartan133t and yes, your name is fitting
spartan133t: Yep. and hello! :)
lol
But if Gaia is Fluttershy
Then Kratos just...
its my xbl name also
...Rainbow Dash?
Gaia is not dead yet
so he killed fluttershy? well,i want to say okay with that, but not even fluttershy deserves it
VenHur: no spartan133t
Fluttershy deserves to live, she never did anything wrong
fluttershy is most evil pony
...Minus those two episodes.
VenHur: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/26352321.jpg
y u hate fluttershy?
cause fluttershy is evil
SCREEE
she most certainly isn't, sir
Fluttershy just has a wild demon in her.
>.element of harmony and animal keeper
Dont we all?
i just saw the My little pony talking baby Spike commercial aahhh that thing is scary
SuperBrony64: talk now
Everypony just about breaks their element...except Twilight.
Not sure how you can break magic.
Maid_RainBow: Wait, what?
man that Sweetie Bell Kratos is epic yet creepy
Did I just hear a riff from the Game of Thrones theme?
...and Applejack, who tells the truth, but screws it.
Fluttershy could be Artemis...
boss?
SCREE
teets
Eeyup its a boss
dont you hate when your nervous for no reason?
SpeedyBolt: There are times when she loses her magic, like when she's tired or scared
that Hyperion
"behold the power of helius" very origina, game, gg
Kill kill kill kill die die die
*original
and his flaming chariot of fire
im seriously, they talk in cliches
they dont even have proper lines
Finishers, finishers everywhere!
shit just got serious!
night every one

nite cow334_gone
bye cow334_gone
Oh look, a centaur. Did I mention that I just killed the god of the dead? Just saying...
OohShiny: yeah, he kills stuff.
He kills stuff because he does it.
He kills motherfucking sisters of fate, that's impossible, and you all know why. Use Dr. Who logic.
YOU ARE DEAD
I love how they tried to give him a personality and make us feel for him. Just...just making him a fucking asshole murderer. They're cool. :D
centaur is too much for the guy who killed death itself
twilight_sprinkle: death itself is Thanatos
twilight_sprinkle: but kratos kills him in Ghost of Sparta
ok
didnt know there was a god of death...thought Hades filled that roll
OohShiny: Of fucking course he does :|
You didnt know about Thanatos, NocturnalBlade?
oh look, there's blood in this game
SpeedyBolt: nnope
NocturnalBlade: Thanatos isn't the god of death, that's Hades. Thanatos is the personification of death.
hes going to die i bet you
twilight_sprinkle: you'll see some intestines now
ok nvm .-.
I take it Kratos hates bronies.
spartan133t: do not doubt the Caramel
kratos is a hater
He literally never likes anything or anyone :P
kratos hates particularly everthing
WHYKRATOSWHYMUSTYOUKILLPONY
even his own weapons?
he kills anything that moves, basically
Petrified_Discord: wow, learn something new everyday...have heard the word Thanatos before but never thought it was a name
So if I take a step near him
I die?
OohShiny: i hope he finds a mirror
twilight_sprinkle: he killed his past self in Ghost of Sparta too
OohShiny: lol whatthefuck
twilight_sprinkle: no Paradox happened
WTF?!?!
What the HELL is that?!
Testing.
AJIsAwesome: A+!
or else Kratos would be screwed.
MAKINAIZE GUNLEON
Dammit
hey everypony
hi Pearly
That song's permanently in my head now.

Pearly: Hi!
But really? I don't mind at all.
CAREFUL KRATOS
hi Pearly
hey NocturnalBlade and twilight_sprinkle and XisBestChemical
how are you dears?
For a creature covered in fur, I don't think fire breath would be a great idea :/
ey darlin *smiles at thelonepony*
You know, I actually feel sorry for these...animal...things.
fine...watchin Caramel kill gods
He's murdering them in the most brutal ways...and its amusing to watch.
SpeedyBolt: You're getting Fluttershy sickness
twilight_sprinkle: Thanks. :D
SpeedyBolt: Worst part of the boss fight. :D
Pearly: Hi! :)
SpeedyBolt: I suggest you to play DeadSpace
:d
hey AJIsAwesome how are you?
Oh god no.
Dead Space creeps me the heck out, OohShiny.

VenHur: Bye! :(
SpeedyBolt: you bet she does. and she plays gta 4 and manhunt
Bye VenHur

Derpy_Hooves: Bye! :(
SpeedyBolt: and Fluttershy is my type too
night Derpy_Muffins
SpeedyBolt: she would choke you in your sleep
That sounds fun
twilight_sprinkle: stop hating fluttershy, or I'll throw you in her shed
NocturnalBlade, yeah, they were rainbow dash and pinkie pie special editions (glitter)
But she told us specifically to "STAY OUT OF MY SHED"
careful shiny
Neat
and SpeedyBolt
OohShiny: ill take you with me then!
twilight_sprinkle: i heard you hate fluttershy
Pearly: niiiice
flutterchu: severe dislike more than hate
yeah
twilight_sprinkle: well twilight was always worst pony to me
rainbow dash lookscool
really? RD is worst for me
flutterchu: why?
way too cocky
hate cocky people AND ponies
twilight_sprinkle: everything
Petrified_Discord: lol
flutterchu: care to specify?
So Fluttershy and Luna are gamers, awesome.
twilight_sprinkle: i dont wanna get banned
flutterchu: or maybe youre just hating her because i dont like fluttershy?
DONT FALL DOWN OR YOULL DIE
So that Rage of Olympus dololly, you fill it with rage once and it stays filled for the rest of the game?
lol
Twilight is in third place in my list
Ded for no reason. GJ Kratos
Kratos is offically better than I expected him to be
Boss time!
...Ew.
Why shieldmen no use their pikes?
twilight_sprinkle: she brags steals screentime never thanks never agreeful thinks she encharge of everything pony and fluttershy T_T
flutterchu: "and fluttershy" yep ive heard enough.
>Brags
>Steals screentime
twilight_sprinkle: anyways TO THE STREAM
You could say the same for Rarity in Season 2.
and Twilight does NOT brag
hha there was a new thing I saw near MLP stuff... "Filly Princess" looks like g1 and g2 of MLP
in fact she does the opposite
Ms. I'mSuddenlyHangingOutWithTheMane6.
I don't like rarity that much, don't dislike her though
like in the Trixie episode
twilight_sprinkle: from your most faithful student
Twilight did the opposite of brag
Dont you remember Boast Bosters?
*busters
I wasn't a big fan of Rarity for a while, but she grew on me
She was scared about showing off, and all that crap.
Ouch
flutterchu: ?
Rarity is a mule.
I am a brony for 2 months already, don't like rarity too much yet
I'll see season 3 first
now i dont want to argue ill get banned
Rarity redeems herself in A Dog and Pony Show.
Rarity used to be my least favorite pony.
Now she's up there with everybody
Anyway
Did you seriously think Twilight was bragging? She said herself that she didn't want to use her magic to show off Trixie because she felt that her friends would think she's nothing but a braggart.
I don't really support best/worst pony arguments.
Dat sun power
i wouldnt dislike fluttershy if her fans werent so "fluttershyisbestpony" all the time
Good night everypony school tomorrow :)
wished Iknew bronys around my area..
*wouldnt dislike as much
nite Ponies47
twilight_sprinkle: They're all wrong.
Look away!
it's not letting me
night Ponies47
bye Ponies47
Everybody knows PINKIE PI- I'm gonna shut up
well I'm a fluttershy fan
Celestia defeats Kratos
I love the shit out of all of them. They all have their flaws and virtues. That is all there is to say on the matter and anything more comes down to personal opinion and really isn't worth anyone's time.
Kratos.
Everypony is nest pony. But Pinkie Pie is bestest.
Case fucking closed on this topic that everyone is sick of.
all the fans are terrible
Reikim: Agreed.
twilight_sprinkle: ;~; not cool
best*
I just try to defend her when people say they hate her
there, i saved you a bunch of bitching
I'm terrible, Buytoast? :<
wrek you played metroid?
probably
twilight_sprinkle: Amusingly you bring that up and we're watching that one tomorrow...er later tonight depending on timezone
You hurt my feelings.
OohShiny: that's my job
flutterchu: well youre certainly not proving me opposite, hating on twilight so unobjectively
*the
I'm trying to understand how Kratos died in that last part.
JESmith71: she has a lot of episodes
Curbstomp
SpeedyBolt: by sun power
SpeedyBolt: probably backed off the cliff
Oh
YOU CAKE
I hate Rainbow Dash because she's fucking cocky, and I hate cocky people (also ponies)
twilight_sprinkle: lauren makes her the "main" character just because she's the only one that she reconizes now stop replying to me so i wont get banned
twilight_sprinkle: I meant when you brought up Trixie and the bragging in particular since Boast Busters is being shown here
Oh...my...god...
looks like Kratos *shades* got a HEAD in life YEEEAAAHH!!
flutterchu: you wont get banned if you keep it civil.
Holy hay GoW????
i cant think of a good head pun!
~DECAPITATIOOOOOOOOOOOON~
hi Biglaw
Better luck next time, twilight_sprinkle
JESmith71: ah k
rainbow horse is terrible because she's a cocky bitch and white horse is bad because she's a shallow whore
the rest are tolerable
Looks like kratos *shades* found the light at the end of the tunnel.
>Rainbow Horse
Not sure if trolling or not.
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
twilight_sprinkle: For the main course, Kratos is serving up some head cheese!
JESmith71: Boo.............:D
Herakles is next boss
wee
flutterchu: honestly seems to me like youre just hating on twilight because she has more screentime than fluttershy, which is what i was talking about her fans
okay everypony i have to go now
bye Maid_RainBow
have a nice day all
I dunno that was the most recent head joke I've heard lately. Quickest one that came to mind
Maid_RainBow: Bye! :)
Herakles is next, I am so excited!
Bye Maid_Rainbow :3
twilight_sprinkle: yes
of course i'm trolling, i have an opinion. having an opinion means i'm a darn dirty troll
goddamn
What a headcase
Bye Maid_RainBow
magmablock: :D
/me Goes the buck to sleep
flutterchu: well bravo, very objective of you. and thanks for proving my point about fluttershy fans
Oh for fuck's sake.
Typically, the main character introduced has lots of screentime.
well time for me to sleep. cya everypony
You'd be hating EVERYbody.
For fuck's fucking sake and you know I'm pissed because I'm swearing.
thelonepony: Night! :)
twilight_sprinkle: well, you insult me because of other fans?
nite thelonepony
twilight_sprinkle: but when did she ever deserve the screentime...........TAKE THAT!!!!!!!!
twilight_sprikles been bitching up a storm all night
OohShiny: no, i meant about some fluttershy fans that just are in your face i disliek fluttershy more, im not saying anything about the fluttershy fandom in general
i'll put in the "go the fuck to sleep" video to help me
Hush now, Quiet now, its time to lay your sleepy head.
Oh for hell's sake someone shut these two up.
Hush now, Quiet now, it's time to go to bed.
twilight_sprinkle: OBJECTION there just being thereselves
zzz
Before you go to bed, just remember that there's probably a burglar in your house
Someone kick them or something?
flutterchu: *themselves?
Aaaaaaah
AAAAAAAGH
Fuck manechat.
TS is making an issue again.
There's a burgular outside my house.
twilight_sprinkle: cheering on what they love most TAKE THAT
flutterchu: honestly, its not fair to hate twilight because she has more screentime. i dont see how it can be fair
SpeedyBolt: Quick! Kill him with fire!
stop ruining phoenix wright you asshat
inb4 some mod chokes a bitch
holy crap
I hit him with the glass I randomly had.
Are you guys kidding me? Each characters have their own characteristics, flaws and quirks. But that makes them who they are, and that's why we love them. There is no BEST PONY and there never will be because we all have different opinions that make us who we are. Whining and complaining about screen time is absolutely pathetic to me, because I don't care how much screentime they get as long as they receive good character development. Also, why are
Repeatedly.
and he ran.\
I agree with AJIsAwesome.
13in this thread, dozens of ponies that can't read the channel topic
I wish a mod would choke a bitch.
I am not trying to make other people like fluttershy
SpeedyBolt: same
Choking is harmful, Reikim.
twilight_sprinkle: HOLD IT what harmony is there in magic
just defending her, and exposing my opinions
choking keeps things in line
agreed AJIsAwesome
Love and Tolerate.
flutterchu: the point of her character is sort of to hold the mane 6 together. yeah shes kinda the leader, again its not a reason to hate her
Ask Darth Vader. The odd choking keeps the minions in line.
someone hating the best pony? what is this HERESY?
Reikim: Lol
twilight_sprinkle: you dragged me into this so youve got the one to blame
another one?
ohai TheMaster
Reikim: Either that or they had a bad taco at the cafeteria. :D
now what ?
Good evening NocturnalBlade
lol
i hate these enemies
i think this GoW is bringing out everypony's inner god killer :D
flutterchu: blame for what? im ok with expressing opinions, im just saying that imo hating twilight for being the leader and having a BIT more screentime than fluttershy is a bad reason
I remember that interview with Tara where she says roughly, "I don't get where this whole debate about best pony comes from. When was it not clear that Twilight is best pony? I thought that was known. :/" :D
just came to gauge the excite levels for the possible!season3 announcement that may or may not be coming.
Do enemies like these usually take so long to kill?
Petrified_Discord: :D
NocturnalBlade: the Magina-like enemies?
He's started an argument with flutterchy.
*flutterchu
No, Pinkie Pie is the best pony.
13this is doom 3 right
In which he pretends to be morally superior to everyone and everything. Again.
twilight_sprinkle: mmmmhhmmmmm a bit T_T
Pinkie Pie is a funny way of spelling twilight.
13except darker
So is AJ, RD, Twilight, Fluttershy, Rarity, and everybody else.
flutterchu: fluttershy has TONS of screen time too
SpeedyBolt: But it is known :P
OohShiny: the what like?
twilight_sprinkle: have you been on the wiki
Carrot Top actually tastes of turnip.
Magina-like
flutterchu: wiki for what?
NocturnalBlade: ever played Dota?
Topic change: Who here has ever eaten brunch?
Really I don't know how he manages it.
OohShiny: nope
twilight_sprinkle: mlp fim
Meme
Half the time he's actually one of the more reasonable chatters.
I have. but have you ever eaten brinner?
AJIsAwesome: lol...i dont think i have
Aw, but I like best pony debates :(
flutterchu: well maybe once or twice, why
TheMaster: :D
TheMaster: that i have done
13the proper form of the question is
SppedyBolt how do you know tha- 0_o nvm i DONT wanna know :D
13DO YOU EAT
brinner is best meal. pancakes at 11pm
Then you get him going, and oh, suddenly he's the onyl right one, everyone else is wrong, it's because they're the way they are not they're fault he can't possibly be wrong.
I dont eat, Shizuka.
:3
Shizuka: :$
AND THEN FAILS TO SHUT UP
TheMaster: Or steak at 6:30
13i don't eat either
twilight_sprinkle: it shows how many episode people have been or NOT been look at twilight page than look at fluttershy and the rest of the mane 6
TheMaster: Do you watch YTPs?
OohShiny: have you played dota 2?
not yet
TheMaster: steak and waffles yum
Youtube poops? uh, not really
O-o
but magina is there
13ponies are very very bad at "don't feed the trolls"
and still the same fucking guy that holds 2 blades
flutterchu: that just might mean twilight has a lot of brief appearances, and since shes usually the voice of wisdom in the team, it makes sense
they're all sort of the same and i've got plenty of spaghetti so I don't need to hear luigi say it 40 times.
flutterchu, twilight_sprinkle: Seriously, take it to another channel. Or PM, for God's sake, that thing exists for a reason.
Just let them do their thing, Reikim.
TS isn't a troll.
13can we stop with the pointless bitching about twlight..
OohShiny: magina looks horrible in dota 2
He's just an egotist.
TheMaster: Oh. I thought you got the brinner idea from AlvinYTP. He made a poop about it.:D
See, everything falls into place.
Grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw grab throw
SuperBrony64: i know your there
I have something to say, don't hate ponies.
Petrified_Discord: I'm wondering...how can stone talk?
he never went to prison in the first place
/me flies over to Shizu and nestles in her mane.
ohia ghosties
i dont know and i dont want to ARGUE FOR THE 5TH TIME NOW so dont reply to me twilight
13canary canary~
SpeedyBolt: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2ypxbZEuj1rnl2pl.jpg
he got community service
cant we just forget this agrument? Love and Tolerate? Hakuna Matata? Why cant we be Friends?
Shizu Shizu
^_^
bah
he needs to be in a cell
Oh my..
Because everyone know ViVi is best pony and then Shizu :p
It's the arrogance.
Freefalling looks fun
dis part is awesome
All the arrogance.
13i am not #2 .-.
Shizuka is best pony.
13i do not make top 9000
Shizuka on my book you are, deal with it :3
I say Raincloud is best pony
So your rank is *shades* over-
Shizuka: You're over 9000?
/me is shot
im sensing a over nine thousand joke here
lol i always died at this part once or twice
IT'S OVER- No.
13in this thread, obvious meme is obviously whooshed
im just wondering who's 2nd best pony
Whoooooosh~
Whoooosh~
Hey guess what
and I will not tolerate Heresy when best pony is insulted.
GUESS FUCKING WHAT
FALCON PAWNCH
There are no pony ranks.
what Reikim
good evening everypony :)
I want to go Skydiving one day.
hai kirzstryfe
13kratos why are you stealing weapons from cloud strife now
Ni ni kirz <3
evening kirzstryfe
kirzstryfe: Hi! :)
LOL Shizuka. He's trying to be hip.
Evening kirzstryfe. I should not be awake. How are you?
Good...Night? kirzstryfe
Shizuka: he stole it from Dante
/me glomps Shizuka runs away
Reikim: Yes there are. Shining Armor is Captain of the Royal Guard. :P
any meme spewed out in here will be ovverused til there's nothing left
It's nearly 12 over here, and i'm still up.
hey kirzstryfe how are ya?
I have school tomorrow, and I regret nothing.
just like with reddit and 9gag
why does he have wings?
Because everything needs wings.
tomorrow is Independence Day in my country
Because Kratos is secretly a Pegasus.
stole them from Icarus in GoW2
so I don't give a fuck
Need to make something more hip? Add wings.
TheMaster cause he is motherbucking Kratos that's why
Need to up the coolness factor? Add wings.
Need to make a poignant metaphor for the human spirit? Add wings.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: lol I read that as Gears of War 2 :P
so they basically made a game by mashing all the greek stories together?
13he's bad at flying
neat
lol
Need to add angelic sybolism? Add wings.
Sketch_Toku_Brony it was not Icarus, it was Daedalus
does Kratos fight achillies?
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vZk13imFkqY/TecyzHdGqhI/AAAAAAAAFWc/U74VpB-Va0k/s1600/P4ZHZ.gif by this graph it actually seems like twilight has less screen time than fluttershy
Shouldnt Kratos' wings have burned up already, if he stole them from Icarus?
Icarus' wings only burn when they go near the sun
Need to have copious amounts of molting feathers floating around for visual fun? ADD WINGS.
a story warning about the hubris of man
Really, there is nothing that wings cannot do.
it's not Icarus wings
Except make food for you.
icarus died, and fell with his wing
/me deshi deshi basara basara
They cant make food for you.
the wings are from daedalus
OohShiny no Daedalus is in this game,his son Icarus was in 2 trying to reach the sisters of fate
Wings can make food for you.
They can?
Icarus' story also led to a very cool Iron Maiden song
I need to learn that tech.
because Iron Maiden is excellent
Sketch_Toku_Brony it was Daedalus man
Need to hunt down an animal and kill it? Add wings.
13assassin's creed, repetitive greek edition
Sketch_Toku_Brony Icarus died, so Daedalus tried to talk to the sisters, so he could get his son back
Reverse leap of faith
Besides, Fluttershy has demonstrated to us that wings can be used dextrously.
im not talking about seconds in episode im talking appearances
13it's the 3d missile flash game only more cluttered and without light
Oh god
Sketch_Toku_Brony: He has the wings because he survived with them, whereas Icarus fell to the sea
Are you still going on about that
No
Shut up
Imagine if Fluttershy and RD's personalities got switched.
OohShiny OH i remember now :$ lol have played these games in a while
Reikim: calm down, youre more heated up about this than we are
/me deshi basara deshi basara deshi deshi basara basara
Because I've seen it over ten dozen times and guess what? It goes nowhere every single time.
Shut up is a harsh choice of words.
people, if I don't see calm in the chat soon, I'm going to start banning
im not mad im just acting like phoenix wright
so either calm the fuck down, or leave
gg Reikim
i'm perfectly calm. -eyetwitch-
dat mad Caramel
you're ruining phoenix wright*
/me calms the fuck down
We've offically messed up.
13protip, my banhammer works just as well as val's
I am talking about Mythology with Sketch, it's all in good fun
so why is kratos trying to kill everything now?
dat GOD of CARAMEL
GoC?
Buytoast: "now"?
they screw him over or something?
Buytoast: Because that's his personality
because Kratos wants a red lantern ring
Shizuka: i thought only wrek had a ban hammer ?
13Buytoast: cause his character arc is over so it's just kill everything now
A god of tasty candy treats? That would be nice.
he seemed pretty calm at the end of god of war 1
Kratos of Sparta, you have the ability to inspire great rage.
Buytoast: That was before they wanted a sequel for the monies.
so Reikim did you smash your co author head already ?
13shipping and receiving departments OF THE GODS
Oh
Not yet.
Would any of you be scared if you had to do all of this?
Buytoast: Zeus stole Kratos Pony plushie, so Kratos wants to kill Zeus and get his plushie back
I know I would.
He's a good sort, really.
I'm helping him with a TTGL fic now that he's rewriting.
thats assuming i'm not a ultra buff spartan
can someone explain it woithout using the crappy ass pony fill-ins?
so obviously i'm not afraid
Reading all twenty chapters the first time, however, was a painful experience.
It's like at the end of GoW1, Kratos just took a bunch of peyote and then NEVER STOPPED. :|
i thought you use a pool nodle Shizu
OohShiny: is the final scene that he returns his plushie and its covered in zeus' blood?
twilight_sprinkle: not actually, in the final scene, he gets his plushie, but the plushie is already destroyed, so he kills himself
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Ponychats Art September Challenge Announced
Buytoast: Let's be honest, it's not really important. Kratos kills things in graphic fashion. That's all they need to sell the game.
OohShiny: yay happy ending!
eh, fair enough
Reikim is right.
i know they made these three
13extra credits did an episode on the series a while back
As long as death happens, anybody will buy it.
they don't really make games for the 'story' these days
they amde some for the psp, didn't they?
13and how disappointing it is that they destroyed the story they built in 1
yes
if you want good story in a video game play planescape torment
SpeedyBolt: like love songs
Exactly.
Planescape torment being the best video game story ever made
Buytoast: Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta
still, this game does have excellent visuals,ill give it that much
The funny thing? A premise like God of War's could have potential.
ttgl uhmm tengen toppa ?
Buytoast: I've played the two and they are pretty good
13can't see it capn
well i suppose if you're going to milk the cash cows press the tits for all you can get
Yup
why would you kill iron will like that?
you monster
so, new job has me dressing up, business casual, near-suit type of stuff
The original was craaaaap
they need a kids version of god of war, where blood is replaced with rainbows and the swords with squaky bats
Iron Will was a meanie, anyways
TheMaster: :D
Full of potential but craaaaaap
13they have one it's called tf2 with pyroland
I'm in the midst of fixing that.
kirzstryfe cause everyon know people can watch you over the phone
stopped by walmart after work tonight to check for some stuff, got stopped by a guy asking for money >.<
TheMaster: Iron Will gets back every 5 seconds
:D
/me giggles.
Shizuka: How many maps are available on TF2?
kirzstryfe: Awwww. How'd that turn out?
Shizuka: i know they also have a kids version of counter-strike, its pretty hilarious
13all of them
:D
iron will wasn't a bad guy you ignorant house invading belfry lurker
:D
I have ~$17 in my bank account >.<
Shizu so funny :3
Whaaaaat
his speech was far too rehearsed to be real, he was a con artist
2 iron wills no
Demon's souls or dark souls wouldn't be a bad game to stream
uuugggghhhh sooo much rainbow
Ah
Makes sense.
I always like the video game adaptation to berserk myself. except when I die, which is alot
agreed TheMaster
Most people actually in need of money do not have the confidence to go up and ask someone.
but since I looked like I make money, he came after me
I've always liked less violent video games.
TheMaster: cary?
Though this does looks interesting.
cary?
13ah quick time events
You do make money now.
I've always liked Cars going Boom games, that's why I like burnout
...You do make money now, right?
TheMaster: is your name cary
Burnout <3
walking through the store, earbuds in so I don't have to listen to people, yes, that makes it obvious that I want to stop to talk to him -.-
my name is The Master
PRESS X TO SAVE THE INDUSTRY
13need to animate an interesting sequence but can't be bothered to have the player actually do it, try quick time events
this game's got them out the shitter it seems
and you will obey me
i loved Burnout
I am, but nothing hits the bank account until this weekend
13acquite suit
13acquire sunglasses
Burnout was in my childhood too.
TheMaster: nevermind
13acquire curly wire earpiece
13walk around
and that unbeatable Xbox game...Ninja Gaiden I think.
Press X to not die
lol
They can't be any old sunglasses too.
my true name is incomprehensible to humans. Unless you speak gallifreyan.
13occasionally stop and speak into your wrist or lapel or shoe
SpeedyBolt: Man, that was hell
i think x might be jump though
I talked with the first employee I saw to get security on him
I only like QT events if they're done only a few times in a game.
They have to be the opaque, square kind.
and Master Who? Just isn't as catchy
SpeedyBolt: but the Nes version is worse, much much worse
I've honestly never seen anything like that before.
Oh god
The worst I've seen is beggars in the streets, which make me sad.
AJIsAwesome agreed imo RE4 did it right lol
TheMaster: i dont *back's away* i only speak english and can read japanese
OohShiny: I have to try that sometime, then :3
JESmith71: The Drink Your Ovaltine movie?
13not sure which is worse
13this
Hermes?
wee Hermes
oh, it's hermes
oh its this guy
13or that useless crate bottomless pit in half life
herpes
GOTTA GO FAST
Unacceptable, get learning Galliferyan.
ultra hyper
said he was an engineer, truck out of gas and had to get down to tampa (3h drive), dropped his phone in the sewer (in florida...), wearing a shirt that looks like he works at foot locker, saying he'd pay me back double tomorrow
dat gay voice
He's not gay
not the upskirt I was hoping for
inb4 YOU'RE TOO SLOW
He's flamboyant
:3
Bullshit.
dat laugh
He's quite happy
eeyup
Anyone saying they're going to take your money and pay you back is bullshit.
Always.
kill blood, how do?
This guy is begging for death, isnt he?
hermes is mad pinkie
most of the gods in greek myths were at various times bros.
only hera was ever a bitch it seemed
First question: he's three hours away, how is he going to pay you back?
He's not even a good con.
which made zues wanting to cheat understandable.
"broke my ankle, just got out of the hospital", walked just fine to catch up with me, and I walk fast
Zeus didn't just cheat.
Hades being the broest of gods.
Yay climbing yay
Kratos is TOO SLOW
dat action
Kratos should teach me how to climb.
so hardcore
he was a fast talker, most people you'd find in walmart at 12am aren't too bright
SO PARKOUR
lol BROseidon god of the BROcean!
Ohai final stage
throw enough info at someone and something will catch, that's the theory
Petrified_Discord: Long way to go bro
AJIsAwesome: Yes. I'm watching the trailer. The kid's older. However it looks like it's going to be DTV
FINAL BOSS!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Hades is broest of gods. Science fact.
flutterchu: not yet
JESmith71: Not sure if excited or worried.
flutterchu: some hours of gaming
flutterchu: not even close
I suppose.
OohShiny: SHI-shitfuck
I guess not everyone's as paranoid as I am...
OohShiny: Yup. Gotta enter the dream and pretend to resolve his family issues
still need to kill hermes, herakles
EXPOSITION
I am so thirsty...brb.
and some others I don't remember
and fuck Aphrodite
they're usually just high, drunk, or idiots at that time of night
Hello everypony.
why would you kill herakles?
God of War?
And I'm guessing you don't fall into any of the three.
nope, just bored
hi Canadian_Brony and yes
:)
TheMaster: because he's at the gods' side?
this isn't one. Two or Three?
Poke the box with a big stick?
Canadian_Brony: Hello! :)
TheMaster: and he mover?
3
...I wonder how often Saxy gets accosted by cons?
k
:P
>working with athena.
>he's a spartan
lol >.<
what?
spartans should hate athena
TheMaster: He does. :P He hates everyone
13this door is locked
why force the player to button mash to open a box
13you have the power to kill a GOD
13but this door is locked
TheMaster: well he killed athena already
Shizuka never gets con'd, because she'd have to go outside first :3 <3
Hey look, there's a Greek historian over there! Awww, he says that the GoW team wouldn't accept him because they couldn't be bothered to give a damn.
The Door God is quite poweful you know
He is not the God of Locks, evidently
13among about a thousand other things
that's authentic hickory
don't underestimate the power of locked doors Shizuka. even the doom marine couldn't get in locked doors without a key
Shizuka perhaps he isnt the Master of Unlocking like Jill?
I'm going out on a limb and saying Caramel is streming.
I dunno
Canadian_Brony: Yep.
and she's extremely people-phobic
/me hugs Shizuka
The Nigerian prince doesn't require you to go outside.
lol
he walks funny with the head
Guys
someone up there was takign a swipe at me about knowing greek myths.
yo SpeedyBolt
We're out of lemonade, all I have is tap water now :<
13he promised me four hundred million dollars if only i would sell amway
noooo
TheMaster: Nah, I was poking fun at the GoW team for not bothering.
ah
Dude, water is fucking awesome
Atleast they tried with dantes infenro
which made it sorta cool
Kind of.
Sort of
4 million money
Though I haven't really read that one.
Petrified_Discord: actuall,y all people who drank water, have died
*played
I like bottled water, but not something that comes from a sink
How WAS Dante's inferno? Was it good?
I read the Inferno, never played the game.
Inferno is pretty boss.
Dante's inferno wasn't that good
and the game was decenttier.
rip off of god of war
as they all are
Disappointed, I am.
just like all shooters rip off gears of war these days.
twilight_sprinkle: "I ain't going to no hospital. Everyone I've ever known who shot themselves has gone to a hospital. WHERE THEY DIED. Coincidence? I think not."
OohShiny: That the series isn't dead?
All shooters are basically remakes of one another
Petrified_Discord: indeed, dont trust the hospitals
13kratos
Reikim: The fifth one is being developed
13killer of gods
REHASHREHASHREHASH -shot-
Petrified_Discord: altho i dont know what youre quoting
OohShiny: You seen Dante's new design?
13walks around with a flashlight like a ballerina
:D
Reikim: It sucks
like the scooby gang
twilight_sprinkle: That makes two of us
13i expect him to plie now
Kratos is a true man.
Petrified_Discord: lol
jinkies athena, we better split up to catch old man zues before he scares everyone away
OohShiny: Yeah, I'm not touching that one. I considered it, because I'd like to play DmC, but then I saw that and...yeah.
twilight_sprinkle: I just memorize shit, I don't cite my sources XD
now I want to watch scooby doo
Congrats, you found the altar of plot progression
oh... puzzles
i think DmC will be good,at least its an AU story :$
13the muses
13is this where zero to hero kicks in?
Reikim, why aren't you levelled enough to play in the dungeon yet?
I've never had a con try me...but then, I've never been wandering aroudn Wal-Mart alone at 12 AM
oh cool god of war?
Shut uuuuup
I only get one or two levels a day.
shizu: already killed the muses in 2
I'm at 20 as of half an hour ago.
Oh look, it's Twinkletoes
walmart after 11pm is entertaining, but better with friends

On the other hand, I can say with some certainty that a grocery store can be quite peaceful after about 10 on a Thursday.
Ghosties: Why?
/me . . . if it's possible

SuperBrony64|Zzz: did ya sleep all day

But he seemed all to pointless there
if you can call this battling
Run faster, Spartan.

Kratos is the ultimate Chaotic Neutral. Matter closed.

Oh dear Celestia

I like hermes because of his voice
hermes you are asking for it!
"You see, by pulling this here lever, it throws a rock placed here where I'm sitting"
Ms.Sprinkle, you're the only unicorn in this chat.
He's all like "Ima gawd who runs fast! You're too slow!
"You mean this lever?"
and hermes die

Not so tough without your FEET, areya Hermes?
I personally prefer the playful people, too.

/me cuddles under the blankie and tweets happily to Shizu ^^
i wish there was a mother 4 EARTHBOUND 3d
Dat speed
boots of herpes, yay
He's Sonicfast now
O___O
Dat Trophy.
ACHIEVEMENT
tap into sanic speed
IshUpTooLatePony: lol
Caramel: you playing on normal?
gotta go fast
I wish I had the Boots of Hermes. Then I could run to school with 30 seconds left before it starts
never be late again
wish i had em...could see my gf whenever i wanted ^_^
he can run up walls too
NocturnalBlade: aww, how cute...
and lose a little weight lol
I wish I had them
Just so I could run everywhere
good thing there were never situations where he needed the boots before huh
I could actually GO to my friends houses then
I think we all wish we had those boots.
Canadian_Brony: true
You said it.
TO MOUNT OLYMPIUS!
Why is life so cruel?
I wish I could teleport
NocturnalBlade Olympus
so killing herpes unleashed bees all over the world?
Canadian_Brony: close enough
OohShiny: same
twilight_sprinkle: yup, that's about it
twilight_sprinkle One, Hermes with a "m". Two, yeah
go figure
You stole Herbees' boots, you get Herbees.
Canadian_Brony: i know his name is hermes..
:D
the world is liek AH NOT THE BEES right now
As irl mortals, we would instantly turn into a puddle if we went that fast, or catch on fire, or both
and chat is liek AH NOT THAT CLICHE JOKE
^
Actually
IshUpTooLatePony: That's why I wish I could teleport
I think if you had enough willpower and stuff...you could control it.
I guess Hermes was the messenger god, and the god of not having bees all over the place
oh...yea teleport might be better lol
I myself want the technique of Chronokinesis.
portal gun
magmablock: :D
Poor Hermes never stood a chance agianst Krados: http://slurmed.com/fanart/gq/011_lazy-hermes.jpg
SpeedyBolt: you naughty bastard
Hermes was the messenger of the gods, the god of travellers, yada yada yada~
:3
why are they killing their own people?
Sexy Time
Is it time for le sex?
twilight_sprinkle - wouldn;'t you if you had two flaming swords on elastic chains?
lol
MirrorImage: no i meant the guards
dat sexy bloodshed
Canadian_Brony: God of Cure too
DONT GET HIT TOO MUCH OR YOU'LL DIE
SpeedyBolt you don't say?
SpeedyBolt: thanks, i always forget that one
IshUpTooLatePony: sexy time?
close enough
i should go to sleep right now, Goodnight everyone
NocturnalBlade: you wouldn't use Chronokinesis for sexy time?
NocturnalBlade I'm the one whose askin
bye TheGreatAndPowerfulT

Nighty, TheGreatAndPowerfulT
nite TheGreatAndPowerfulT

bonk-ded
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THOSE BALLS, BRO
lul

OohShiny: ...no <_<

they dropped their balls pretty hard
seeya IshUpTooLatePony
bye IshUpTooLatePony
edd: *sigh* cant beleve tord's leaving/aka greatandpowerfulT
Nighty IshUpTooLatePony
NocturnalBlade: lol, me neither. >_>
I would use Chronokinesis to live forever
...whats cronokinesis again?
control time
the ability to control time
thought so
i would use chronokinesis for godly things, like extending my time on a quiz
I would just use it to rewind my mistakes.
if I used it in my body to stop aging, I could live FOREVEEEER!
Like
Say I wanted to confess to this girl
NocturnalBlade "Crono" is "Time", "Kineses" is "Control with Mind". IOW, "Controllng time with your mind"
If I screw up/get slapped, I can rewind and pretend it NEVER happened
useful
flies?
well, if I was in an exam, I would pause time, go search how to do the question, and then go back
Bees.
I could actually say my awesome thing to say 4 hours after the conversation!
See, now you're thinking with Crono.
buffah
buffer power
indeeed
gah, buffer
god of buffer
Buffer averted
But for how long?
Here again?
i bet kratos couldnt defeat the god of buffer, hed just put kratos in eternal buffer
hey Caramel, do you have any idea why we got a buffer screen?
jsut askin'
twilight_sprinkle: OBJECTION! He killed the sisters of fate
Canadian_Brony: buffer screen is gone now tho
I know
I'm a curious bastard
sue me
OohShiny: well they werent gods of buffer :S
/me sues Canadian_Brony for 1000000 dollars
twilight_sprinkle: they controled fate!
O____O
OohShiny: WAIT A MINUTE you copied me
Can you sue for that much>
*?
twilight_sprinkle: they could just make kratos die from an illnes
Dat hallway
blue
SpeedyBolt: why not?
If the sisters of fate control all events, doesn't that technically make them more powerful than pretty much all the gods put together?
...Good point.
blue iz my fovorite color
and she isn't dead yet?
magmablock: yup
magmablock: god of war logic
The sisters of fate hate me, apperantly.
magmablock: or rather lack of
magmablock: and if you kill them, time ends, and the world comes to an end
My last two days have been hell.
SpeedyBolt: me too
Dat scream
what are those things anyway
Sirens
ah
Reapers?
SpeedyBolt: nah, just Sirens
i was gonna say banshee
Ah...
o.o
never hug kratos
NocturnalBlade that's Irish folklore
But he looks so fluffy D:
Damn
Thats long
Canadian_Brony: yea...thats why i stopped myself XD
I'd run out of breath before I reached the top.
k
ooh is it that part?
Q: What is the proper etiquett for hugging a ghost of Sparta? A: Don't.
the one with the secks game?
"That part"?
Aphrodite?
no doesnt look like it
why does every boss room feel like a final boss room
is it an instrument?
Ancient Greek guitar hero
oooh yeah, aphrodite
that guitar hero
instrument of murder hero
tuning the strings?
lol
I want to learn how to play a guitar
and then he broke the string, game over
i had 5 years of music school on guitar
I want to learn how to play that thing I'm guessing is an instument
now i wish i played violin or piano
Shiny X

Brb.
OohShiny: true

Possible.

DONT GET HIT TOO MUCH OR YOU'LL DIE

Loading..
/me whistles
dat loading was big
I want a PS3 so I can play this. And God of War II. And the first God of War
I have a Ps3 :3
I don't have it
dat blood system, like bloodrayne
it's fucking expensive in my country
thats not a lotta health to work with
yay for kewl sword
Struggling wont work, bitch
he ded
I told her this..
I love how the other enemies are all like "Hey, let's enjoy the show!"
Ikr? :D
gg
Games logic man
love it
Kratos is pissed off by these stairs
I love how in assassin's creed brotherhood enemies will attack you even if you're in a kill sequence :P
realistic
i think there might be a secks minigame somewhere around ther
twilight_sprinkle: aphrodite
wondering if it involves Aphrodite
she's the goddess of sex after all
sex and love
beauty
she's a naughty cadence
lol
Is she pretty?
she has boobs
men die from her beauty
SpeedyBolt: would be hilariously ironic if she were ugly
brb looking up a picture so I die
"Baby, if looks could kill, you could cure cancer. You ugly."
DUDE
lol
I'M GOING TO USE THAT
...If you dont mind. :p
that anti-pickup-line is badass
It's on the house
whos streaming
Caramel
i must shamefully admit that i dont get it
That sexy Caramel person.
Hera
Hera!
the bitch I'm guessin
HERAAA
easiest boss ever
Haira
>goddess of Marriage
finally
Heyra
>married her brother
it's Herakles now
no wonder why Zeus Cheated
he'll kill Herakles
mah boi
wee Herakles
Uh oh
kevin sorbo
dat Hercules voiced by Hercules :S
Looks like Andre the giant
it's fucking HERAKLES!
and Kratos doesnt show an INCH of fear.
Hercules is Rome's
damn you GoW creators
God of War
Freakin Title drops
jappleack would hire herculeez for that
love that helmet
13th eh
it's like a mowhak
tured 90 degrees
BOSS TIME!
yeah, the weak zombies will stop him!
ah whip mah sword back and forth
That'll show him!
Canadian_Brony: That's actually a fair representation of a Spartan Officer's Helmet.
Anyone getting Crash Bandicoot: Time Warped vibes?
> "Do not fear him!"
> dies from fear
AJIsAwesome: yes
buck norris is better
AJIsAwesome: Tiny Tiger if am I right?
Kencolt wow, I know nothing of history
OohShiny: Yep.
me neither
i forgot everything as soon as i wrote the tests
herculeez vs little mac i can imagine
tis a shame since i actually did study it
the 8 bit little mac
flutterchu: yo, that's herakles
Canadian_Brony: Specifically, high ranking. Lower ranking officers wore a front-to-back crest, and rank and file wore crestles helmets. I watch a CRAPLOAD of H2 and the Military Channel.
impaled by spikes? no prob
this year, my history will include aboriginals which, apparantely, is so dull the funniest teacher in the SCHOOL has trouble making it fun
Kratos must have a bunch of blood in him...or something.
impaled by spikes? I call Mortal Kombat
Mabye no internal organs?
Canadian_Brony: At least in theory... in practice the crest mant Officerf, and orientation was kinds laz in battle.
kratos is made of jelly
Nice game nice game man
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Equestria Inquirer 51
did Hercules shrink?
Herakle
Herakles
wow
whatev
not that looks like a Tiny Tiger attack
her ankles?
i swear he shrnk
now*
*shrank
how does rolling on the ground protect from his aoe?:S
GoW logic.
...Actually, most vodeo game logic.
Herakles is Tiny Tiger
nintendo logic these days...
How did Hercules shrink??
how did Luna grow?
How does Celestia look so young?
Luna can be any side she wants
How did the world turn upside down
i heard someone mentioning something about him dying of fear
she's a fucking goddess for Celestia's sake
maybe he got smaller from fear
How much wood would a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
Canadian_Brony: some
40 gallons
I thought he died there
12
No offense, Hercules, but you should've payed attention instead of turning your back to your opponent.
Canadian_Brony: chuck norris
It's simple logic, guys
flutterchu -_(\
SuperBrony64|Zzz: dat like yayayayaya
How much sword would a sword chuck chuck if a sword chuck could chuck sword?
Rule #1 of a fight: Never have your back turned.
When you think you've won, let ALL your guard down
Didnt Chrysalis do this?
AJIsAwesome rule #2: never dig straight up. No wait, that's Minecraft
Canadian_Brony: :D
I can dig into air.
wow hes actually dying
ded
lol
Atleast he doesnt have to restart the whole fight
so the "less cloth-more power" argument must be true!
bear hug
Then I shall fight naked, the next tme.
*time
kratos is almost naked too
SpeedyBolt I will fight less than naked!
...Noskin?
ancient greece, they are all naked
wha-I dunno
sure
the buck did I walk into here?
:D
lol
aw but he just wanted a hug
here we go :D
All he wants is a hug, Kratos.
Show some brolove
he turned from herankles to hulk :O
wow
hi Sylandest. Welcome to random plus stream. But mostly random. And stream.
...Shit
Did he really do that?
ouch ouch ouch
when they said Herakles was powerful, didn't think of this
dat face
a man walks into a bar... and he says ouch!
Canadian_Brony: I like the sound of this
also ow
BONK
BONK BOKN
How I met your mother?
ouch
the floor would probably just crmble instead of falling
anyone?
anyone got the How I met Your Mother deja vu?
IN YOUR FACE HULK

oh man, they made a wall
oh well, might as well give up
The main character is Fluttershy
indeeeeed
and Kratos was all like "Fuck your wall" and punched it
why kratos is fluttershy?
they are both awesome
idk
"All that shit you shield guys gave me before, I don't even give a FUCK about!"
cause fluttershy is evil!
Because Fluttershy could potentially kill everything in her path, if she wanted to
Canadian_Brony: in soviet russia wall F**k's you :D
Not a single fuck was given that day
fluttershy says she loves everything in cutie mark chronicles, kratos is the complete opposite
flutterchu . . . I don't even . . .
no
just
just no
Her Agressive side
OohShiny: fluttershy just hides her evil!
Have you seen it?
well, she will not kill them to make them love her
if I see one more of these "X is evil" debates, I'm turning off the stream and putting the channel in mute
ok
...Sorry.
i was joking, sheesh <.<
Can I say Zeus is Evil?
So um...
x is eviler than w
Forget you.

He's literally saving her and beating the heck out of the enemies
nope
twilight_sprinkle . . . sense.exe does not exist
well, Kratos is finally being a good guy

Canadian_Brony: yeah they didnt program it into this game

TheRandomkid321: caramel is
Do you think that girl is dead yet?
hi TheRandomkid321
Oh thank celestia
TheRandomkid321: heh. still lotsa blood and gore tho
SpeedyBolt I think she died when you heard the "crunch" and blood-curling scream
I never got into the God of War series.
I still think Doom is a far more bloodier game than this. :D
it is
yeah it is
TheRandomkid321: Same here.
Hey all
but doom has more point to the violence
Allegr0: Hi! :)
hi Allegr0
Hello Allegr0
and hai Allegr0
I alwys saw it as mindless blood and gore.
Hey Allebr0
sup Allegr0
Allegr0: You excited for BFF?
hi Allegr0
TheRandomkid321: thats cause it is
wee
twilight_sprinkle And sex. Don't forget sex
...

Those sounds...
Guess what?

Do it, Kratos.

She can be totally seducing...

Caramel: aww but youre pretty.....
Kinixys: Hi! :)
I guess its for the better, guys
I will everyone! We're just under 14 hours out
AJIsAwesome: HI AJ!
Is he reason you're so ugly, too?
BOSS TIME
Aj, gigas driving :P
SpeedyBolt wouldn't doubt it
I assume this hgame has no strong plot and is just blood and sex coated in a thin shell that is the story?
TheRandomkid321: eeeeeeeeyup
No. I cant.
ouch
so he IS the reason he's so ugly!
lol
I knew it!
Oh god the voice acting is equaly as bad.
Tartarus
Tartarus is a bottomless pit of empty blackness.
wee, let's visit tartarus again
no
dat laugh
this is no Equestria, you know
It looks like it
:p
yeah the zombies do make it looks like ponyville
Hooray for magic!

well i think im off to bed..night everypony and thanks Caramel for the blood and such ^_^
Bring friendship to Tartarus, Kratos!
g'night NocturnalBlade
D'aww D:
bye NocturnalBlade
Bye NocturnalBlade
Oh wait...
zombies and a centaur. yep, thats new
NocturnalBlade: Night! :)
God I cannot believe how this became such a popular series. The story is horrible and barely existant, the voice acting is crappy, and it barely seems like a challenge. Bloody hell. I want to back to 1983 so I could play the NES.
twilight_sprinkle and this isn't even Tartarus yet
TheRandomkid321: its the perfect game for the average teenager
I dont want to play this, but it looks very intersting to me.
TheRandomkid321: and there are lotsa average teenagers
twilight_sprinkle true.
well I'm a teenager, but I love retro games
OohShiney Me too but that isn't the average teenager.
my friends call me crazy, but they don't know how to appreciate old games
I have my gamecube hooked up right now, it's on Sonic Heroes' menu screen
OohShiny: then not average :P
they always talk about graphics
TheRandomkid321 pick up a controller, get to my age, and look for a blood and gore game with puzzle solving, reflexes, and not FPS
tbh i never liked the old games, they seemed to repetitive for me
like mario
Earthbound?
I still have my old N64 with the first game I ever palyed EVER.
Who play video games for story nowadays?
DK64 was the first game I ever played.
I do
if I want a story I'll read a book
Canadian_brony... me.
Canadian_Brony: i can always enjoy a good story
I loved that game with all of my life.
Canadian_Brony: *Looks at Shadow Of The Colossus.*
the first game I ever played was Sonic in a Sega Master System
AJIsAwesome never heard of it
RDR has a great story from beginning to end and, although it is existant, it's more than just blood and sex.
Canadian_Brony: Well there's RPGs since those are more story-centric
Canadian_Brony: What? :O
Canadian_Brony... Get out!
>Never heard of Shadow of the Colossus
JESmith71 true
...Do you...live under a rock?
AJIsAwesome you read correctly
hes patrick?
I dont think he's pink
or fat
SpeedyBolt no I live in a house
TheRandomkid321 no thank you
A pinapple under the sea?
no
Canadian_Brony: Shadow Of The Colossus is an indie action platformer that is known for its amazing story and gameplay. I highly recommend you check it out.
nowhere close
Canadian_Brony A journey into the mind of an average teenager.
Most of the dumb teens I know STILL play games like CoD
TheRandomkid321 far from it. Calling me "average" is like calling the UK dry
still, like i said, good cisual design in GoW
*visual
I ignore physically, but mentally i'm just all "Why?"
Hi guys
AJIsAwesome I will make a mental note of it and forget in the morning
hi SafariMonkey
Hello SafariMonkey
Canadian_Brony Well you don't play old games. You don't play games for story...
hoi SafariMonkey
SafariMonkey: Hi! :)
It's that beautiful time before school
Canadian_Brony: :D
hes aalmsot ded
ded
Canadian_Brony: But seriously, the game's pretty good. It's known as one of the best video games of all time.
TheRandomkid321 the oldest games I play are Mario games
AJIsAwesome: shadow of the colossus is that good huh?
twilight_sprinkle: I wouldn't say THAT good, but it's a good game nevertheless. :D
AJIsAwesome and I thought Bioshock got alot of praise
The only game with guns I ever liked was Goldeneye on the N64.
Otherwise no.
My SOSE teacher is a barstard. I used to like him until today when he gave us the task sheet for our assesment he gave us a "simplified" version expecially for our class. Geez it's like we don't understand correct english.
Canadian_Brony: I never could get into Bioshock, IMO.
So what's the game?
Is your class full of idiots?
Or did anybody piss him off recently that you know of?
SpeedyBolt... Yes now that you mention it... I cans tartle them with a complex sentence.
TheRandomkid321: whats SOSE
twilight_sparkle Social Science.
TheRandomkid321: It's mostly likely the standards the current generation is displaying that's causing him to do this.
*most likely*
TheRandomkid321: mkay. btw press tab when typing a name for it to autocomplete
well, I think I'll be hitting the hay now
bye OohShiny
DONT LEAVE ME
OohShiny: Night! :)
night everypony
OohShiny: Nighty D:
twilight_sprinkle oh derp
Good night OohShiny, Good morning

Oh, good.\
Nigh OohShiny
Time zones are weird
I have to be up in 6 hours.
anyway I gotta do homework.... Tehn later the 3L milk challenge... Wish me luck mates....
I have not gotten an ounce of sleep today.
bye TheRandomkid321
TheRandomkid321 eugh. I have planning this year and I have to show of one of my "skills" tomorrow and try to teach the class how to do it. I know for a fact you simply can't teach one to sing. A particular song, yes. In general is like making love in a canoe.
GL, and cya later.
seeya SpeedyBolt
Wait
I'm not leaving
lol
Canadian_Brony: making love in a canoe XD
oh
Bye TheRandomkid321, have fun looking like a zombie from L4D :P
...I should leave, but i'm not leaving.
I'll post a youtube link once the video is posted to youtube. Get ready to see ALOT of puke that is 95% milk.
twilight_sprinkle Canadian metaphor and fun joke. Amazingly useful with the right crowd.
im sicl

Oh your playing on the playstation console huh?

HA! i knew it
Sup
Ill see ya later evrypony im gonna play a lil bit of tf2
ok

The PSP one or console one?
I'm pretty sure PSP, though.
.. someone streamed "Friday" from Rebecca Black at work...
i think the console
Ohaidar KnifeH
Jmo: Hallo
Dat Rebecca Black.
Jmo: Now I'm sad I left my broadsword at home.
Aww poor KnifeH.
Pucker up princess.
KnifeH: i true warroir needs no sowrd to kill his fow
scottish-geeky: True, I should just beat him up with a Scootaloo plus filled with bricks.
Just for playing that song. I find the punishment suitable.
KnifeH: dare you go lad
you know in gmod theres so many charecters from a diffrerent game
O>O
Great. Now mom's pissed.
why is that
Too bad for her she's got Krato's to deal with.
Ninjazz: loll
im back btw
Wb.
You do not fight the giant scorpian for it WILL inevitably imprgnate you corpse
thanks Ninjazz
DerpDash|Away: thats nice
Np.
scottish-geeky: no... thats SCIENCE
DerpDash|Away, unfortunately for the giant scorpian. The roles are ALWAYS reversed when Kratos is involved.
DerpDash|Away: ohh ok
Oooo TF2's done downloading ok NOW im away :P
ok
Erm.
I guess the role wasn't reversed this time.
am I the only pony that wnats to murder somthing rite now
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #431
Caramel: u made me want to go kill things now
So this is the PS3 version.
Ninjazz: ther is only ps3 ver of good of war
Theres a PSP version too.
Ninjazz: ok
Ghosts of Sparta I think it's called.
SPARTAAAA
scottish-geeky: Actually, God of War 1 and 2 were PS2 games.
Kencolt: ah i thot hay wer all on ps3
scottish-geeky: This is, I believe GoW 3.
Kencolt: i thinks so as well
I think so aswell. I played this game and it looks familier. >_>
well
mah boi.
Ninjazz: to bad he not here
All of them are on PS3 now as well
scottish-geeky, IKR. ;_;
Ninjazz: sad face
Ded.
\THIS IS SPARTAA
So is he doing a run through of the whole game or something? Didn't expect it to go on nonstop for this long
Oh so this has been going on for a while?
Yeah for several hours
leonidas vs Kratos who will win
that depends
Good thing there's Sea ponie Lyra to keep us company.
did leonidas piss off kratos?
Caramel: nope kratos said this is madnes
I'm sure Kratos would have gotten pissed off looking at the pretty boi, yes.
It's not hard to piss off Kratos, anyways. >.<
kratos gets pissed off by everything
Ninjazz: ha not when your a spartan king
what's that, a tree? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
scottish-geeky, now he's a spartan ghost. :D
and then the tree was slaughtered
Ninjazz: XD
...I don't know which side to choose.
One started the meme.
The other is a badass god slayer.
well i think they would go drinking instead of fighting against each other XD and when they are drunk go on a killing spree with the one were kills less then the other has to pay for the drinks XD
Ninjazz: Lednitos killed a god king
Ninjazz: who kalled him self a good
Might as well been an Egyptian pharooh.
(sp)
lol
Yes... Kratos and Leonidas would get along like a house on fire. And by that I mean lots of screaming, panic, and people running all around in confused fear.
dedus
Kencolt: lol awesome
Moopy, now you can live Scootaloo's dream.
Moopy: ohhh scooter
heheheheheheheheh
Kencolt, counting each other's kills.

Luv your songs, bro.
Oh hey sumica you still up man?

Kratos: Look you, I have faced agains Ares Himself, and slain him, betond ANY REDMEPTION. Leonidas: That still only counts as one.

SimGretina, but would you rather be home or at school? ;p

Oh, if that's the case, then I see your point.

Nah just ded chat
Major inactivity methinks
dayum.
Kratos flies through the sky and no one has something to say about it? o_o
Ninjazz: He wasn't flying. He was falling and going splat. Hell, even I ca fall and go splat.
For that long and controlled, Kencolt, I'd call it flying.
Oh this part.
I hate this part.

Ikr?
What's this, your second or third playthrough?
iunno
What is it?
Lol. Let's just assume it's not your first.
DAT GARRUS.
joke in another channel
Don't mind me.
Just had to because of my man crush on the man/alien.
okay then
"Yes, sir. Ponies have become a matter of national interest." << line from a bizare fanfic i'm reading
[05:22:35]	<Zia>	I haven't fucked with zombe for a while
[05:22:39]	<Zia>	calibrations
[05:22:45]	=-=	YOU are now known as Garrus
context
keep the chat clean please
Garrus, done with your calibrations yet?
Phase4, if by nation they mean the internet?
Oh shite.
http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/video-game-memes-ill-just-stay-on-the-normandy.jpg
Phase4: lolno
Ninjazz, in context, they are government officals
officals'
i cannot spell
Garrus, ^ Ninjazz
Damn right, Shep.
wat.
Phase4, harvest pony for magic?
And friendship?
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/49173/
A Lyra has joined the fight!
KnifeH: She always gets involved. :P
/me hugs Spectrum_Rush. "Hai." :3
Phase4, oh that fic. Looks interesting. Might read later.
Ninjazz, awww, i was gona yell Boo
I can't let you do that, Phase4.
Ninjazz, its an odd read, also ties in with another fic, probably by the same guy
Phase4, oh... if that's the case I might hold off on it. Don't want to read another fic to understand the concept of this one. >.<
Ninjazz, its a minor tie in, share a character
Spectrum_Rush, BOO!
Phase4, ooohhh. Eh. Still lost /some/ interest.
Phase4: D:
I said I can't let you do that!
You're making me look pathetic. :<
well im going to go watch MLP episodes from ShadowBlastAplha's youtube channel but i'll be here in the chat ok just send me a message and i will get back to yall ok
Have fun Moopy.
eeyup
Cya.
I might do that.. maybe
i wonder Phase4 why now of all times would you try to scare me whn joining
Spectrum_Rush, just felt like it :P
and here i thought it was because i was joining from my phone and not the normal ip Phase4
XD
best part of the game coming up
so glad I got here before having to sleep :P
Caramel: whatd ya do speed run the game, youve been at this since like 9pm

I wonder why no one told me...
>.>
The time is a lie.

That wouldn't surprise me
Good morning Bronystate
Good morning Gold_Demona
Mornin' Gold_Demona
Gooold demonaaa~
Jmooooooo~
How are we this morning?
good morning :)
so much noise
is this an end sequence?
Hello, DaringDerpy.
Also, Gold_Demona.
And now it's NOT time for calibrations.
talking blue lights bring no good
They can only lead to blue light specials
And then moral of the story.
slaughter the zombie god and the game is over
Needs more cob cannon.
he has no health bar. how can you fight gods without health bar?
Spam circle button
Apparently this was too bloody even for this game. That SCARES me.
oh f..., it's 12am already. another wasted day
Personally, I thought Posidon's part was more brutal.
12pm? pm...
It's almost 6am over here
what's the name of this toy?
11am
bad friday, Gold_Demona. full of hangover and meh
D:
That's suckage, DaringDerpy. :<
what is the halo slavegirl doing there?
whats this
yes, the only fun I will have at the moment will be in complaints
see like even yesterday the youtube screens got a little bit bigger but now its smaller what the buck
80% of what I saw so far were interactive movies
game over?
Youtube.. you never know what they're going to do next
it didn't change for me
same youtube as always
well on my screen it got smaller
Isn't there a button to make it bigger?
this is not how the god business works
And then trilogy over.
call your lawyer, women!
-e +a
Now time for some prequals.
fireworks time
well, can't believe I went over time for so long
jeez...oh well
hope you all enjoyed
i did
Thanks for playing it whole, Caramel.
T'was interesting indeed Caramel
Thanks Caramel
it was brutal
And the final god still doesn't get it...
and now, I bid you all goodnight
Sleep well!
10/10
Night Caramel
Good night Caramel~

Goodnight Spectrum_Rush

Spectrum_Rush, WHAT?! D:> Awww, man. :C

ikr well bye for now
Bai. Hope things work out soon.
Random, so you psuedo random or true random/

Random can be whatever Random wants.

part 3 or so
http://web.archive.org/web/20050731010142/http://www.youtube.com/ internet
DaringDerpy, RIP Youtube
U-Toob
DaringDerpy, i think the current design is better
It was probably some unloved side project back then
Phase4, same. Or we probably just got used to it by now. :/
wonder if its still a bunch of python scripts
Ninjazz, no, current one is better, the old one doesnt encourage the video crawling behaviour the current one does
Like the first few days after every Youtube change, everyone bitches about it then there's the point where everyone just deals with it.
Phase4, Ah. I see what you mean.
http://web.archive.org/web/20070102235047/http://www.youtube.com/watch.php?v=_eoppP5jBoM the layout has stayed mostly the same though
wonder if that video is still there
Ninjazz, i like how i mentioned it was a bunch of python scripts when clearly it says watch.php
You lost me at python scripts, Phase4.
Ninjazz, that web archive was taken in 2005, video hat 850 views
it now has 950
had'
Hmmm.
well im off to bed everypony i'll talk to yall in the moring ok..........peace

Dem tab fails :D
Phase4, back when there was a choice between 1 and 5 for ratings.
y u quit after join Dumorimasoddaa
Ninjazz, the yes/no like system probably works better tbh
Because he knew you were going to hug him. :p
lol I miss the youtube stars
I agree.
But I missed the ability to choose. :3
I wonder if reddit had a 5 star system at start
or digg
facebook
This anti againg ad has a pic of a badly editied baby photo to give it facial hair :|
I know it's hilariously bad

AdamTheDuck BTW I failed the milk challenge. Aout 1/3 left whatever I put in my mouth came right out.
Chat derp?
No.... Dabuck is everyone?
TheRandomkid321, lolwut :D

And we're all ded
But some of us might be Still Alive.

Guys, the secret of Bonbon and her many voice http://derpy.me/UPNoP
/me hugs Phase4
wow Dumori, have fun with that.
i wonder how much valve is making of mann up mode
Good luck with that, Dumori. Hope it doesn't suck TOO much.
Phase4, not much I imagine. Boot camp is still a viable option.
its a completely optional mode, there is no game in mann up you cant play outside on a public server
And plus, isn't it just a /chance/ to get a trophy head?
Hello?
Yello.
Is it workin?
Yeah now
Ninjazz, you are garuenteed to get one botkiller weapon per tour of duty completed
Ninjazz, theres a 1/50 chance you'll get a gold botkiller wep which is worth crazy huge right now
Phase4, oh. So wait... you get a bot killer WEAPON? You don't get an addon to put onto your own gun?
nope
That's kinda lame.
I'm gettng BF3 premium I am SO excited... Oh and I failed the milk challenge :< and I don't taste like rainbows anymore :<
Metro 2033 is fun :3
TheRandomkid321 yeah armoered kill is coming the 11th
AdamTheDuck god damn yes that game is soo good
Time to save Bourbon's sorry ass
Only up to chapter 3 :3
So just for clarifacation BF3 premium goves me acess to all the DLC for BF3?
TheRandomkid321, pretty much.
Phase4, have you gotten any bot killer weaps, yet?
Ninjazz, nope
Awww. :<
AdamTheDuck what do you mean pretty much?
Also, Phase4, how much do the Mann Up tickets cost?
$1 each
TheRandomkid321 you get access to all DLC in the future and will get it earlier for example premium PC gets the 11th while non gets them a bit later in the month
you need 6 for a tour of duty
TheRandomkid321, pretty much all the dlc, early access to them, a shitty box cutter knife which replaces your prefectly fine normal hunting knife, a crappy guide which you'll never read...
Feh. Still too expensive for my blood.
perfectly*
server's trolling me
that and EA's just stealing your dosh.
i join on map change every time
killerpony7733 so I get all DLC in the end right?
AdamTheDuck still premium is still more worth it. you pay alot less to get the DLC packs cause in total without buying premium it would cost more
AdamTheDukck Well I may as well blow s much money I have while I don't need to pay bills XD
TheRandomkid321 Yes you get all DLC that will come for BF3 and get early access
Erm... Not sure if I'd want to buy ALL the DLC.
That's the thing, you think you're getting a deal with buying all the DLC's because you think you're going to get them all anyway
AdamTheDuck Does this box cutter knife come with any extra damage?
Probably just get me Armoured Kill and be set for the rest of the game's life.
TheRandomkid321 nope cosmetic skin
Because the infantry combat in BF3, imo, kinda sucks.
TheRandomkid321, nope, no differance other than looks
Much more of a vehicular combat game.
AdamTheDuck can you have your normal combat knife?
If they lowered the disabled threshhold of vehicles. -.-
Ninjazz yeah that's how i would see it. But i'll get all DLC anyway so if theres more air and vechicle maps i won't complain
TheRandomkid321, Nope, stuck with yellow box cutter knife of uglyness
Nijazz I beg to differ but everyones entitled to their own opinion.
killerpony7733, hopefully. I wouldn't want to waste my money on any other kind of map.
AdamTheDuck... Do the military eve use those knifes IRL? Does it only look like a box cutter knife?
Also there apparently is going to be a new play mode.
Ninjazz Yeah the tank mode where you fight for areas?
Also AC-130 is gonna be interesting
Anyway don't try to talk me out of premium alright. My mind is set on traget.
TheRandomkid321, http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120605034349/battlefield/images/6/64/ACB-90_PNG.PNG
but in first person view it looks like one of those Stanley knives
TheRandomkid321 I'm not saying you should. I say if you got the money and want to save some cash do that
killerpony7733, I guess so. All I've heard is that there is going to be a new play mode. AND YES, AC-130 is going to be very interesting. Finally a new target for Aircraft to target.
AdamTheDuck it doesnt look TAHT bad. Oh but in FPS it looks like a stanley knife? Aw well.
Ninjazz yeah but it's still a flying fortress as you would expect from the impressions so far
killerpony7733 I have 600 in my bank account so yeah.
I just want my Battlefield 2143 already...
AdamTheDuck hehe i never got to play that mode with the huge flying base
killerpony7733, I wonder if it's going to be like the bombers from 1943 and just be a plane that gets in position to fire a few salvo's then leave, rather than be an actual flyable vehicle.
I heard it was god damn good
Titan mode... I miss it so much...
http://sliceofponylife.tumblr.com/post/31050598403/the-cakes-and-the-seven-grumpy-bons-sorry-that
Ninjazz it's set on a path that it follows that allows you to target most base points
Grrr. Not what I wanted to hear.
Ninjazz well it's most likely to prevent abuse
Imagine flying that to a enemy base and just raping it
Plus bad pilots crashing it
That where AA come into play.
killerpony7733, THAT is good enough reason for me to accept it.
God, bad pilots. -.-
Ninjazz yep i know the feel especially with chopper pilots
killerpony7733, ikr?... Like, I know you need to learn and gain some exp, but can you not crash us?
>.(\
Ninjazz eeyup
Also tv missiles <3
Too laggy to use TV missles properly. :c
Also, have some trailer music. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PhecAd_gLI
Umm i have a somewhat decent FPS on it. So if i do it right and my pilot can position me i CAN hit something
I just have a terrible connectoin to the server, so it takes like... 4 seconds for the missle to move at all, then it keeps heading in that direction and crashes into the ground.
That sucks
Tell me about it. =.= I was looking so foward to being able to attack tanks from miles away.
And maybe a lucky chopper or two.
Well techinally you can't snipe things that easily with a TV missile
Good morning everypony
You need to be closer and have the right angle
Hello, Ponies47.

Wow
AtalontheDeer: Nice :o
merci
HIYA everypony
You know. Sometimes I'm kind of happy I don't use a mic when I play TF2 and such. For my mom bugs me atleast every 5 minutes and says some of the stupidest stuff :|
was last weekend at a furry convention
Those suits get damn hot tho.... My friend s a furry suiter, and let me try on the suit x_x
Apparently, spoilers for the new Dr Who episode: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/d54b90f7159603d8692eba4d0a973a73.png
*is a
I mean does she have to bug me every 5 minutes or so. I'm 14 for buck sake. I'm not a little kid anymore -_-
MadSurge, not really spoilers, you'd have to watch the episode to understand it fully.
AtalontheDeer: Where was it?
here in germany Magdeburg
Jmo: Yeah, I don't understand why a Daek would want eggs :D
:P

MUST PLAY SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS
O.O
Do it!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=eAkropNE7us
i havnt played shadow of the colossus, but it sounds kinda dumb
AtalontheDeer: No vid links during stream :P
ok
You know what? I haven't done a random word search on pony art collections since Ponibooru announced its closing...^_^ Lets see what I can find in 20 minutes
there will be 14 more ponies the next months
AtalontheDeer: Damn those... its hard enough going through the day with bulky Hands. How did you get along in Hooves!? :D
will be a hard working winter
*Damn tho
http://derpiboo.ru/89717?scope=scpe73304f2e19a9960d6a961d41f3b39fc38657a6b5
well ther openings in the arms
RoboGerbil: can i give you this box?
cosing by neodyn magnets
closing
might not need the number sequence at the end of each link O_o
Bronysith: what? am i being shipped again?
but yes going around in hooves is kind of different especial you would like to press a botton of the Lift
RoboGerbil: you called shadow of the colossus dumb
and you havent even played it
before you judge it, play it and form your own opinion from it
i said it sounded dumb, the premise. i mean c'mon how fun can killing 1 dude be through an entire level... sounds like a lame platformer
its incredeable how fast hasbro is on you tube to remove any view of a fursuit of the MLP Gang
Hmm?
Warning: Cuteness Overload http://derpiboo.ru/16540?scope
Scoot, you ARE the master of transitions

Cypresswolf|BFF-Prep: broken link
RoboGerbil, worked for me
Same
aww, was trying to cut out the long number sequence
AtalontheDeer: Did you have to make a certain contraption for the legs?
http://derpiboo.ru/16540?scope=scpec4aed3a99dc1d86d3e639935d7e30804a372e3a4

That's better. ^_^

Hi. I'm GreeHetBronyInDuitsland witha different name
Cypresswolf|BFF-Prep: you have to activate the languages in system control first...default is one activated language, so switching with the key combo does nothing

I think Rockepella were everywhere in the 90's
when you got internet fuckah
00,03Who is Dewey?
The only place I remember them is on the Carmen Sandiego game show. I had to actually look for them to find their music.

Gold_Demona, rockapella... are epic
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
00,03Thats... pretty morbid
kirby's kinda nuts
KIRBY!!!!!!!!!!*eyes sparkle*
Pearly: Indeed, they are
Wut, Kirby anime? :D
I watched that show everyday
i love you kirby even though yur anime's a little bit 3d
MadSurge, yup they had an anime for Kirby
they had an animation one
And 4Kids did their usual travesty to it
i havent seen kirby in years
kirby doesnt know dafaq is going on
Its like he is a *sun glasses* a star ship trooper? YEAAAAAAA!!
I like Kirby Mass Attack, it's a good game :)
:D^
Love that guy
Dedede's assistance
hey guys
Pink DVD!!
I love that guy.
damn buffah
that was creepy.
Why is there an open flame so close to that poor tree?
Did the villagers threaten it with the fire unless they got answers?
that's kirby!!!!!
link?
NOOO I WANT KIRBY
aight im back i got me a coffie and got me breakfast in my bedroom
BOOOO where is Whispy Woods
HAHAHA CORRECT PREDICTION
is this the first episode?
when i first saw kirby i thiought his ears were his hands
flutterchu, those are hands
Kandarihu: i know
POKEMON SPEAK? :[
So you thought his hands were his ears?
And then he died. The end
haha they made where in time, show too.. it doesnt seem as good as world
pink and puffy is just my thing
00,03Is kirby a boy or a girl?
Does it matter?
His gender is probably vacuum.
kirby is a kirby
Yeah. Vacuum.
05kirby is asexual
*walks into bronystate* *sees kriby* aaaaaaw yeah!
I pretty much consider Kirby to be male.
Villagers sees king nearly run over children, no fucks given
Wrek: pretty much
get it, he has the food!
Dine & Dash
that's just the way he eats
Kirby is.
HE KILLED THEM ALL :D
Kirby just is.
flutterchu: he ate fluttershy! D=
i thought kirby ate things whole
omg!
Barbetos|AtWork: why would he have wings it's a fluttershy kirby
meta night!
:D
Barbetos|AtWork: he really just ate Whispy Woods :D
flutterchu: cuase he ate fluttershy!
00,03Metaknight is a sexy sounding MLG~

Everything is more badass with japanese
giant octopus: yep, its japanese.
Also, I bet there was no mention of Nightmare or Zero in this series~
00,03what is with anime and tentacle monsters...
Must... Ressist... Urge... to... Make... Hentai joke!
i've seen enough hentai
Scoot-Scootaloo: you should play kirby boss music at this part.
WATCH OUT FOR SQUIDWARD KIDS!
Barbetos|AtWork: agreed

/me moonwalks into the chat "Hey guys" :)
Well they did not expect that.
hey dude
Kirby contains a black hole with in his being. I am sure of it
kirby got vacume cleaning power, he aint gotta explain shit.
Whoever is controlling Kirby is shit at the game, only now he thought of eating them
I could of never guessed
"I willnow say Kirby every single time I mention anything about him."

Barbetos|AtWork: probably Pinkie would drink it only with packs and packs of sugar on it :D
i just made 2 refferences with that.
good luck finding them out
MadSurge: You forgot to add all the pastries she eats after that.
meow?
Barbetos|AtWork: anyway, raw coffee does nothing to her :D
My feeling towards who is best pony among the mane 6 seems to change with the day of the week now.
Who is your Monday pony?
S3 will fix that I am sure.
umm, ever thought of waht pinkie would be like when she takes cofee or energy drink?
Barbetos|AtWork, it'll probably change with each image.
Er, episode
Gold_Demona: I never had the "uuugh mondays" thing, so...
sup everypony? had a good night sleep?
Kandarihu: I would be fine with that.
Rarity was my original favoritest pony ever though.
i cant pick a fav pony, so when people ask me best pony i say discord.
Ember, you're a genius.
Ember: you can say Spike too
:)
Gold_Demona: I already was a silly guy with colorful things in his brain before ponies :D
I wasn't...
lol
I was a crazy guy
yay DXHR
nobody understood me, because I kept saying crazy things
i was a guy with no humor or joy in my life.
ollo y'all
almost like pinkie pie, but not as crazy
Wrek how ye be today?
I am thinking of doing a speed run for this game.
It would be lots of fun.
OohShiny gonna have to speak louder, I'm wearing a towel

Dken2021: HOW ABOUT THIS?

They're fine Wrek.
Wearing a towel? Long hair?
*level
Barbetos|AtWork: that, or he's naked.
Like a sir.
Well the towel would have to be impairing hearing, so just towel head then?
The only clothing one needs.
did im just say aperture science logo on that box or am i going crazy?
saw*\
Latter.
Ember there are a lot of things like that in this game
confiscate the power tolls
Spray paint cans have the "I am disapoint" face on them.
Wrek taking security precautions.
wee, hacking
why are there power tools lying around?
sigma symbol!
Wrek dat DX1 song in the radio
just a question, whats the objective of the game?
Ember it
it's story narrated
Pfft, the objective is to kill everyone and steal everything.

00,10dose movie night count?
And candybar, dont forget about the candybar, Sumi
Gold_Demona: Just tell me right away, I can't figure out what's different .__.
SuperBrony64 but no butt?. You need plot with butt D:
11,02D:
Sumica: Oh ok
MadSurge: Your browser doesn't support animated gifs?
Sumica: Nothing else?
Silence pistol. Best weapon.
00,10depends on how time looks
No serriously.
It's by far the most dependable weapon in the game.
11,02Going to take a shower naked then
Heehee.
It just might be so broken it doesn't register as a gif
As opposed to taking a shower with clothes on?
I TAKE SHOWERS WITH MY CLOTHES ON.
Ninjazz yep if you upgrade it right and everything it it becomes that
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
Its illegal to shower naked in Florida, hehe.
killerpony7733, and it's also the weapon with the most attainable ammo.
So double bonus.
Ninjazz pretty damn much
MadSurge: It's supposed to explode in a nuclear mushroom cloud and then reveal the real movie night poster. Which shows Batman (89) and Starship Troopers
11,02Sometimes I do my laundry in the shower, but it's time to treat myself today.
O_o
Seriously I need to change time zone, movie night starts at midnight.
Lol
What does she mean, YOU PEOPLE.

Gold_Demona: I got that straight away, no Discord thing :D
00,10well there is an image i could have gone all day with out.
"You people?" What do mean "you people"?
MadSurge: That's weird.
Gold_Demona: Ikr

Gold_Demona: Starship Bloopers is my fav movie :D

Taaaakin care of business~

Gold_Demona: wait for tomorrow, european night is much earlier :D
Gold_Demona: I might stay up, but it stats at midnight GMT
MadSurge: Again, don't know if I'll be home for Euro movie night. :P
MadSurge: When's that?
Anyway brb, I need a freaking shower. My hair is a mess :D

SafariMonkey: tomorrow at 2 PM EST I think

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Mortality Report

Sumica: agreed
Doctor Fluttershy!

hi Sonny
Well hello there, Sonny. How was your day?
00,10it's amazing how far wrek's quality has come in the past year
thank, and good exept for the fact that my laptop still doesn't work
:p
Sonny: Any update on the laptop?
Ah. Computers, don't they suck? :)
and this colossus is a flying one -_______-
still broke
but my dad would come today to take a look
don't think it'll work tough
anyway any update on wrek's work :o?
I saw the Scootadooze picture yesterday :p
Sonny something wrong with it?
It randommly broke and took all my work with it :p Dken2021
ooh, that sucks
yup
Sonny: Why do you say you don't think it'll work?
odd how jenson reminds me of solid snake
nope, hard disc broke
but Maby it's just an unplugged thingy
idk
gonna get a computer anywayz so yeah
not soon tough :(
Sonny: I was wondering wether the HDD isn't the root of the problem, but wether something more inegral has broken
*integral
well it could be
Sumica, in gaming or drawing? Or both?
don't bother yourself tough ^^ it wasn't that proffesional anyway
(the things I made)
Altough it took a full day
Yusssss.
Anyway SafariMonkey : any updates on the Scootaloo picture Wrek was working on :)?
00,10his art Kandarihu
00,10look at his DA
00,10look at first page and last page
? I looked at it but I didn't see anything different
oh ok
00,10or just compare the two aj's
sec
Sonny: Other than that, I think you should be able to replace the hard disk only and save the cost of a new laptop, but not the work you olost
*lost
Ye i know :p
yeah, quite noticable. i love the current style
I like Admiral AJ is alot better than his "Bad" AJ.
ifyouknowwhatImean.
I'll let the guys who give me garantie fix it (don't know what 'garantie' in english is) since (I think) it will be free
warranty
I know what you mean alright Ninjazz :p
As do I, Ninjazz. But "bad" Cheerilee..oh bby.
I'm glad you do. >_> <_<
LadyCanary, wait waiwta wait. "Bad" Cheerilee? This exists?!

Eli, have you heard? The dishes population has been rising. But so few have jobs. They're.... they're getting desparate and have started resorting to petty crimes... robbery, even murder!
It's a nightmare out there.

...Or was that Foster's...? ...Maybe both?
11,02All done ^-^
Did Lauren work on Fosters?
11,02SpadeMagnes[School]: Yeah
think she wasa producer, or writer
Wb.
What shows did she work on?
11,02Powerpuff Girls was one
Lauren? She brought the coffee every morning.
Then as time went on. She became the brains of everything.
I know she was in the Iron Giant credits
11,02Best coffee delivery girl in the cartoon business.
Wait...seriously?
Dun dun duun.
Well damn thats quite a step up in the ladder...
Nah. I'm joking. She was hired to help on Power Puff Girls with Craig and that's when she started getting attention.
In my three playthroughs, I always failed this dialogue...
/me giggles.
Oh..welp
She's married to Craig McCracken. Adorable couple.
DUN DUN DUUUUN!
Oh so much.
So. Much. Dun.
So what's this I hear about Powerpuff Girls 2013? So far, I've made it out to be a hoax.
...I really hope they're not messing with me, Kammerjunk :I
Kammerjunk, wait wait wat? What have you heard?
I liked Mojojo so much
SpadeMagnes[School] wait, turns out that image is from a flash animation
Ninjazz: I have heard that "Guess who's back?"
Back again?
Blossom's back? Tell a friend?
Ninjazz: As in http://derpy.me/aPKkF
Kammerjunk, ... this is unprecedented.
And probably fake.
Just wanted to know if anybody knew anything else.
Dat startrek Google logo
I'm back
huh, it's the 46th anniversary of star trek today
We'll see. Craig wanted PPG to end, though. But who knows. CN might be tired of their bad reviews and want something actually worth while. Atleast potentialy.
God.. its been on for 46 years?
Because everyone knows, EVERY brony will watch PPG.
Ninjazz - and then some
Atleast that's a VERY high probabilty.
MirrorImage, indeed.
what was it?
What joke?
Ninjazz: i think i wont
well, my google logo is my country's indepence day, I can't see it
Twilight said do I look like I speak squirrel
OohShiny aww what country?
Eli, Eh. I think it's fake too. But that's what I think.
eh, thought it was just a coincidence
SpadeMagnes[School], oh that joke.
CCCP: Brazil
Gesundheit.
i see
Because Twilight=Bubbles. Bubble=Tara Strong. Tara Strong=Twilight.
Dats the joke
Ninjazz: well, i won't watch it, even if it's real.
its not just a logo though its also a game
Eli, why's that?
TO THOSE who have played shadow of the colossus, would you say WANDER is an antihero or a hero?
Hi, everybody :)
'ello Molly
Ninjazz: don't forget Raven :)
hi Molly
well Bubbles acts like Fluttershy and has twilight VA?
ello Molly
Back btw
Shame SotC never got a sequel
Ninjazz: just not intrested. besides, i can live with being called a brony, but a power puff boy?
Hey, Molly.
This looks funny.
Eli is that a thing?
MadSurge, oh yes. Evil beware. We have waffles.
what's the problems with this guys
But Power Puff Girls is a great cartoon Eli!
Eli, ... hey, if the show's good, I don't mind.
Dken2021: i think i was joking :) but it might be :P
Wrek: I was out
Ninjazz: pissed off Raven is really scary D:
Apperently from what I heard, New Super Mario Bros 2 is not selling well as other mario games
hi MadSurge
They walk funny.
Hey CCCP! :)
MadSurge, damn well "end of the world" scary.
Wreky u so silly.
Ninjazz: OHHH I C WUT U DID THERE :D
Lol.
Wrek, WHY U SO AWESOME AND SILLEH?!
MadSurge, :3c
SpadeMagnes[School] well repeated music, graphics, and gameplay can only go so far
Dken2021: but it is an awesome game
Dken2021: and no it does not need a sequel
Sneaky...
hello
I was surprised Nintendo seemed like they were running out of ideas
hey mentallyeffedguy
Craaawling in the veeeent!
MadSurge: Danish has butchered that song for me.
Hey, mentallyeffedguy.
Also I am not going to get a WiiU this year
hai mentallyeffedguy :s
Its way too expensive right now
so Wrek is playing games again?
Kammerjunk: in italian it sounds pretty good D:
Wrek, the code is 1, 1, 1, 1, ....err...1!
essentially, New Super Mario Bros. 2 is a metaphor of how rich shigeru is right now
^
^^
VenHur: it's A, A, A, A, A
Werent some of the games Nintendo made based on Shigeru's life?
Like Pikmin or something?
Like Kirby?
i wonder why deus ex is half third person and half first person
Anybody hate clowns?
Me
Ninjazz so shigeru used to run around eating whatever crossed his path?
and why does the people he is fighting have downsyndrom?
Vat's that sandvich? Kill them all?
yea, zelda was based on his childhood, and wii fit was when he was doing exercises
SANDWICH!
Sandvich is good fuel for killing tiny cowards!
Well, spectifically Zelda, since it's based on Shigeru's early life of exploring his surroundings.
SANDVICH!!!!!!!!!!!!
heh... we are such a bunch of nerds >_<
Wasnt the chain chomp based on a dog he encountered?
alexxm, that and sucked real hard and laid eggs.
Also, btw, I have no idea who that is.
SANDVICH. Moist and delicious.
lol
ja SpadeMagnes[School]
MirrorImage: I prefer to call myself a gamer
:)
Ninjazz: the sandvich is a lie!

Dken2021: He's like a teeny tiny Spikey Wikey.
00,10hmmm Seasion 1 eh?
Who the fuck thinks people would buy a 600$ console?
Who could forget "Five hundred, ninty ninty US dollars."
SpadeMagnes[School]: In our country it was about 1400$
im probably not gonna buy the dvd, when i can watch them all free on youtube :P
00,10I would be willing but not for online purchace
If it so, then my reaction. [squee]
OohShiny: No offense but your country sucks
SpadeMagnes[School] it was the most powerful console at the time
fatality
I'd get it, if it beats the torrents online in quality.
SpadeMagnes[School]: I know that
Where do you live anyway
Dont run! DONT RUUUN
SpadeMagnes[School]: too much taxes
These guys are nuts.
They're crazy in the coconuts.
SpadeMagnes[School]: my country is Taxlands

They need therapy
SpadeMagnes[School]: just kidding, it's Brazil

Palm to the floor and people die. Everywhere, people die.
Kammerjunk: See what you did there.
OohShiny, I've been hearing about the absurd inflation in Brazil. My heart goes out to you.
mentallyeffedguy: why? i get the joke but it sounds like it something bad.. besides, you should have your own...
I might go play Xenosaga later
Man I love that series
Kandarihu: thanks, brohoof /)
Eli: hahahaha it would be funny if you always where red around the "area" just because yyou where allergic :D
Is this almost done?
Ninjazz: Invisible War is horrible, HR is better
I know. I've played both, Zia.
mentallyeffedguy: just imagine the pain...
All I know Deus Ex for is A BOMB!
Ownage.
*fwoosh*
it would have been horrible
Deus Ex is a great game
And Wrek makes an entrance!
"Oh there you aBOOOOOOOM.

So excited for Paper Mario Sticker Star
He sounds so sincere.

Emil: Why you so call when stream.
God I love Paper Mario
Kammerjunk: Because... Pinkie Pie?

mentallyeffedguy: a game for wii?
OohShiny: crazy prizes
How much would a 3ds game cost?

SpadeMagnes[School] - i believe they ballpark at $40
Wrek gonna talk to the humanity front guy too right?
oh, norway? heck if know

mentallyeffedguy: games for wii are never more than 90$ here
Pah.
We need augentation to go through for Dues Ex to get made.
I am a pirate because the games are just too expensive
Eli: im talking about ps3 games
OohShiny: Argg
i dont have a wii
mentallyeffedguy: yeah, ps3 games go a bit higher up
This is the first game I have ever seen with realistic elevators.
Hi guys I'm back again
Wirisme: No, you're not.
Emil: nazi zombies in BO had realistic elevators
hai Wirisme
Never played Mass Effect 1?
You never got back. This is a dream.
I'm not?
/me spins a top.
Ninjazz oh god no
Kammerjunk, are we dreaming?
Wirisme: In a moment, you'll wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
SpadeMagnes[School]: a new PS3 game here is about 100US$
No!
Wirisme: You will never see just how far the rabbit hole goes.
ohh yeah, same here
Oh. Matrix ref.
I choose the blue pill, Kammerjunk!
I never liked the sideways Black Wii Model
:)
Ninjazz: I choose the rainbow pill!
They took out gamecube compatabilty
Blue pill is tastier
Kammerjunk, I choose the Polka dot pill!
1 norwegian kr is 0.17 usd
gesundheit
mentallyeffedguy: 1 brazilian real is 0.49 usd
OohShiny: a game here is 599 kr

Ohai
Heus, MaxTheBrony!
hai MaxTheBrony
Hi everyone(pony) :)
I;d like to see crysis on here
SafariMonkey Crysis 1 or 2?
mentallyeffedguy: and the minimal wage here is about 300 usd
Oh, lol.
Do you know how sad it is when your in a class chatroom and the other 280 students or so act like immature kids?
OohShiny: in the hour?!
SpadeMagnes[School]: On a smaller scale, but essentially yes.
mentallyeffedguy: month
OohShiny: i was starting to winder
wonder*
MaxTheBrony: crysis 1 probably. Better gameplay and at least as good graphics
SpadeMagnes[School]: they are talking about you being a brony?
you cant live on 300 usd in the month
:) good to hear you chose the good one of them :)
SpadeMagnes[School]: well... my classmates don't need a chatroom for that. and the teachers don't do anything a bout it, because their parents are rich
GRAFIKS DUNT MAK A GAEM GUD
we earn about 4000 USD a month
CASUAL
dat Diamondback
Buytoast but crysis 1 has better gameplay overall.
mentallyeffedguy: at least you can survive
Middleschool sucks
Physics
than the crysis 2
Eli: What a world where money owns the people.
SpadeMagnes[School]: damn right
Kill everyone, Wrek.
conveniently placed heavy weaponry means bossfight
bye everyone, dinner waitss
That'll be easy.
bye mentallyeffedguy
Have fun, mentallyeffedguy.
Makes it worse when the site i do school on is slow as fucking hell and its on IE
WHY
Boom.
MaxTheBrony: I still play 1. 2, not played it since I realised I didn't like it.
Kammerjunk: in a country where the banks controll all? what did you expect?
Wrek did you raise the graffics? if i remember correctly you had it on worse before :)?
Eli: Nothing less.
SafariMonkey i love the mp on Crysis 1
Is it just me or is Crysis going backwards in technology?
atleast in gameplay
this crazy guys are worst than zombies
from fun open world to cod feeling missions.
MaxTheBrony: so do I, unfortunately I have a certain iq imbalance.
/me hugs the person below me
SpadeMagnes[School] yep it is
/me hugs killerpony7733
/me hugs CCCP back
Hehe
Sequels do not work that way
:D
SpadeMagnes[School]: I should tell you about Megaman
Dat dinner :)
Dinner is nice.
yes it is .
:)
Dinner killed stream?
I miss megaman so fucking much
SpadeMagnes[School] They downgraded it from huge open world to small linear and narrow and downgraded things to make it run for consoles
Oh
mmmm...foods.
MaxTheBrony: IQ 145 overall logical and 59 processing speed. Hence I am not good at shooters, and prefer to take a sniping role
killerpony7733 exactly
dinner sounds great actually. imma go eat. later
It didnt
me too SpadeMagnes[School]
I remember hearing it's infamously high system requirements. But it's on Steam, and according to the store page there, the system requirements don't seem all that unreasonable for a modern computer to have.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Megaman 9 and 10 are 8-bit
It also uses a 3rd Party DRM, though. Securom
SafariMonkey i love sniping :)
I could care less how a game looks as long as its fun to play
I like pie.
^
oh that song! i liked it by real big fish
And Crysis is published by EA.
I like pie too.
SpadeMagnes[School]: I'm talking about downgrading technology
Dken2021|FireEmblem: which fire emblem are you playing?
GRAFIKS ARE EVERYTHING
Pie is liked by me
SpadeMagnes[School]: and Megaman 9 and 10 are hard as hell
I enjoy a challenge
Estethics are pretty much half of it .. not graffics :D
SpadeMagnes[School]: and it's good to play
Theres an real awesome video explaining it
Alas I do not have wifi on my wii or Wii points
Whats it called now again D:
Le sigh
Buytoast: Well, well, looks like SOMEONE's haven't seen the graphics of Pikmin 3 yet...
like i give a shit
It doesn't matter graphics for me
I'm just kidding.
sounds like the best plan so far
i'm getting it regardless
BronyInstrumental a translated SNES version of the first game
Have fun blowing 300 bucks
MaxTheBrony: I love sneaking in and suddenly revealing from the middle of the camp by destroying the huts they're in just for fun (I die and open my save)
she's gonna cum!
Oh! I remember this one.
SafariMonkey same!
:D
i love it.
run forrest!
boss time
I have returned
Welcome back Gold_Demona :)
*cue Kid Icarus Uprising boss theme*
MaxTheBrony: Great minds think alike
I have finished washing my dishes, and you know what I found?
they sure do :)
wb Gold_Demona
SpadeMagnes[School]: is Kid Icarus good? I've seen the name but nothing more
Uprising is fun for me
People say it plays bad, but it really doesnt
My kitchen sink! Can you believe it? I thought I lost it, but it was under the dishes the whole time. Who'da thunk it, huh?
Hello?
Hi NavyShadow
I love this video, search for Penny arcade Graphics vs. Aesthetics... but do this after this stream , i dont mean to take viewers from wrek, its just an good video.
The difference between Kid Icarus and the new game can throw some people off.
I always annoys me when people bitch about control issues in games they have when I never have them ever
*It
is BronyState streaming the canterlot wedding encore tomorrow?
eh, don't think they stream repeats
Skyward Sword for Example, a guy I know said the controls were horrible, I never had control issues
controls are my favourite thing to blame for my shitting playing, along with cerma angles
shitty*
camera*
:)
Woah
that spawn
Not trying to be ignorant but I wish people would quit picking at every tiny flaw to make a game look bad
Skyward Swords controls were shitty
MaxTheBrony: Don't you think they ruined crysis when they made it for consoles first?
but there were some moments where they workded well
SafariMonkey it makes me sad :(
I never had a fucking problem with SS' controls
I dont know what everyone's deal is
I wished they would have learned and made crysis 3 like crysis 1 but no...
MaxTheBrony: I was looking forward to that so much
hehe, Wrek saved at a great point :3
times where a stab would register as a swipe
anyway gotta go everypony. Bye!
That happened sometimes but I dealt with it
times where you swung one way and it registered a differnt direction
Bye SafariMonkey :)
farewell SafariMonkey
i could deal with it too
Never happened
bye
but not when it made it impossible to kill things
Has anybody played The House 2?
I never had a issue killing onsters
well go ahead and keep your rose colored lenses on then
what are you guys discussing?
Im serious I never had issues that made me dislike the game
O.o
i like the game
i dislike the controls
stop putting words in my mouth sonny
It wonked out a bit sometimes but it didnt get unbearbly bad
:p
Victory?
SpadeMagnes[School] your in school?
O.o
So?
Nah , just curious.
i heard someone was making a bioshock movie
pick a ending TRON!
19 days till I can buy MoP
good for you :)
alexxm: oh heavens, let's hope not!
Welp
MadSurge well if uwe boll is far away from it it could be good
alexxm: point taken :D
Man I can't wait for MoP, shit will be cash
*so
Blow up the place
MadSurge besides the games have a strong enough story that it could work
My personal opinion of MoP is that it is meeh
why can't you link to the AI?
woah
MoP? *shivers*
This is where i liked the game alot though the ability to choose endings in a prequel was a bit silly. The endings are done soooo well
MoP?
however*
RaveBrony: <_<
I hate what MoP has done :'(
Dat live action footage.
:P
Getting rid of my damn totems like that :[
When did you return Gold_Demona o.o
wats this?
Its Deus ex ending
:)
oh
Learn to deal with new mechanics
A while ago, Jmo. I ninja'd my way back in. =P
:<
Its old mechanics....
Just with pandas
:P
How is a shammy supposed to function with 1 heal spell, and 30 seconds totems!?!
what's MoP?
Mist of pandaria
Waldo throwing a molotov
Gold_Demona: busy cleaning up?
Mists of Pandaria
Yet...no one relizes people requested the Pandarens for a long while
MadSurge: Nope. Crocheting. Can't type and crochet at the same time. Need to grow more hands for that. :P
well, New super mario Bros U does look like a bit better than New Super Mario bros Wii 2 -.- but I still don't think I'll get a Mario Game for the WiiU XD
Hello, Bronystate! How are you all today? :)
I would only buy WiiU for the zombie game at the moment :)
I dont care about the Pandarens :o I welcomed MoP!....until i saw the changes...
Gold_Demona: :D
hello tehre AJIsAwesome :)
Hiyo AJIcAwesome
Hi AJIsAwesome
I don't think I'll get a Wii U at all.
hi AJIsAwesome
AJIsAwesome*
Yay Wreky!!!
and hi everyone, just joined as well XD
Heya AJIsAwesome !
G'day AJIsAwesome
Heya LadyCanary !
I wonder if they will do another ARG with this game
Kammerjunk if i gave you one for free would you like it?
or series.
And if anyone bother to READ THE LORE they would know Pandarens have been around for a long time
Wrek Still love how they did the endings. Though i cannot due to canon of the series story like how they did it
hi LadyCanary :)
Lil_B: Hi! :)
Thank you for streaming it and commentating, Wrek. =D
/me claps for Wreky ^_^
Thanks for streaming Wrek !!
hi Lil_B
CCCP. I already have a free Wii. It's currently gathering dust.
hi CCCP, any better?
Your commentary was awesome.
Kammerjunk oh :s
/me hugs Lil_B Gold_Demona Wirisme CCCP MaxTheBrony and RaveBrony
It was good! I would like to see more of this stuff :)
Lil_B not really :(
I like the Staff pics in the credits :)
yeah
morning guys
That's not to say I don't like Nintendo. I just can't be arsed going all the way downstairs to play games.
hey Brad[Laptop]
Brad[Laptop]: Hi! :)
Wrek Well if you want sometime we could own in tribes ascend again
it shows how muche effort and people it takes to make a game !! :D
SpadeMagnes[School]: I know they have been! But i dont care about Pandas. I dont like the changes made to the classes. I dont know about other classes, but Shamans sure got racked in the nuts! x_x
love that
Lots of candybars?
dat music
Wrek how about Super Man 64?
dat sleep :)
RaveBrony: I know... I was venting about the people who think MoP is ripping off Kungfu Panda
MaxTheBrony yeah despite how silly it is to add different endings to a prequel game. They damn as hell did the endings well though
Bunch of dipshits...
SpadeMagnes[School] ping?
SpadeMagnes[School]: MoP?
Mists of Pandaria
You know that Warcraft 3 had pandas in game before Kunfu Panda, right?
SpadeMagnes[School]: Never heard of it.
New WoW Expansion
Ninjazz: Eeyup.
Oh, okay.
Ninjazz DUH!
now whos endangered?
Was a joke before that.
Ninjazz: I do, some people dont
Lil_B yeah lol... i might be AFK for a while soon
Ninjazz: I guess it's the Warcraft version of the cow level.
Good. Cause that's kinda BS.
Ninjazz i know that :)
Pandas are chinese, chinese people know kung fu... ITS COMMON TO COMBINE THE TWO!
Kammerjunk, lol. Kinda sadening.
CCCP no prop, your health is top priority :)
Still
guys
People need to learn to freaking read the lore
it cant be helped that people get confused by pandas after seing both..
No its not
:3
But some people dont give a crap about the lore.
But you just played Invisible War!
...
bbl
I knew from the get go they werent related
MaxTheBrony there is nothing to be confused. People should just stop assuming xD
I dont give a rats ass about the lore of wow.
:)
The lore is the fucking story
oh my
i honestly dont care about the pandas, i just want the class changes
wow had a story?
LOL MaxTheBrony.
Wreky's going soooooooooft~
/me gives Ninjazz a stealthy Ninja Hug
A fuck ton actualy
pony_1286 but... I'm a panda ;A;
I didnt get much enveloped in it.
they didnt present it good enough
...
Imo
Well I respect that
/me senses the essence of a hug and hugs the precense of Lil_B back.
MaxTheBrony i still prefer the non MMO warcraft
I love Wc3!
You're being reasonable about ti so I respect your opinion
:)
I'm just a gigantic WoW and Lore nerd..
I havent seen Nittany in a while. Is he ok?
I hope so.
Oh god. The "Pony sisters/brothers club" ep of Pound Puppies was just. It was too great! :D
School started, I blame that.
*just on
ponies should be the new race in wow
I wonder if Wrek likes this game:P
pony_1286 xD
Yeah and i can see why you are looking forward to MoP if iyou are , but for those who arent read up on the lore its hard to look forward too
RaveBrony: Pony sisters?
Oh, Kyle's probably fine.
... brb, need to update my browser
im sure they could add an equestria continent in there somewhere
Pandarens were requested to be a race way back in the BC days
No one remembers that though
I still want that god-damned two-headed ogre playable character.
Yeah and they prob worked hard for these 4 years to make the world beleiveble.
4 ( or more*
and why the HELL arnt TUSKGARS A PLAYABLE RACE?
I WANNA BE, A FREAKING TUSKGAR!!!
I want to be the guy.
Cuz they smell like fish ;P
But man o man I looove my motorcycle
:P
I can say one good thing about MoP: I don't have to farm TLPD twice.
TLPD?
Its a shame im now going to stop playing WoW.... I havent even had my Ashes of Al'ar that long :'(
Imo i think gw2 dont need Mounts .... BUT it would be epic if it had some :)
SpadeMagnes[School]: Time-Lost Proto Drake. Took me a few months getting it once.
The name fits
It does.
God-damned rare spawns of rare spawns.
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
I still dont have TLPD :[
I spent ages looking for that stone drake in Deepholm
Same
O.o So many people in this game...
its incredible
It's legit enough to be funny. :D
I wanted the Drake of the North Wind.
I have the eastwind
It clips badly
electro jazz?
:P
Half of my character's torso clips into the body
ah
its this.
/me snaps to the beat
Some on say Jazz?
what is this genre?
:)
/me jazz hands
I still say the difficulty spike from Ragnaros and Deathwing is fucking massive
/me jazz hoofs along with LadyCanary.
shit, i don't even remember what mount i have
anybody seen people using potion of illusion to turn into giant snakes in their main city?
jazz hooves :D
I hade a horseu
deathwing is easy shit
a shame really
Needs more spirit fingers in here!
Ragnaros is way harder
Dat Bob Page
ragnaros was harder
Itbugs me
The staff quest is a bitch to do
Anypony played "The House 2"?
Dr.reed O.o
Firelands was Amazing!! DS was a shame....
Oh there she is.
Dragon Soul was shit
Fight is hard enough... I dont need a knock back effect added
the only interesting part was the back fight, and even that felt underwhelming
i remember back in wrath you would be lucky to even get to the second to last boss in icc
Who is Bob :P
?
Duuuuuun
Ahhh
Allright
Bob the Builder?
Muffin for Gold_Demona.
Wrek Duh anyone who has gotten that far in DX1 knows :)
Buytoast: Thats the only fight i like. Keeps you in the game, constantly watching every aspect of the fight.
Thank YOU Wrek ^_^
THanks, Wrek. :)
I have this weird talent that allows me to immitate voices pretty much perfectly
Thank you, Wrek.
I wanted to fight Deathwing! not his damn little spawns...
Thats a pretty epic talent
and I'm back ... I have no video currently, but judging by the voice I heard Wrek is playing a Quantum Conundrum?
I think its over
or at eleast I heard John De Lance?
Good evening, everybrony.
Hey, Malavolent :P
hi there Malavolent :)
I have no idea how to raise my mana count in MoP
Ohai Lil_B, just the person I wanted to see :)
But anyway, Ragnaros was some nice nostalgia ( since ive been a player since Vanilla :))
Malavolent: Hi! :)
Malavolent errrr... thanks XD
He actually has legs this time Rave
Ah the good old days when it took 4+ hours to get a raid together :)
Allo everyone.
hi Meanwhile
Hey, Meanwhile.
When nobody bitched and left after 3 wipes
Hiya, Meanwhile!
RaveBrony: Or one wipe <.<
SpadeMagnes[School]: Ah, true. 3 was a little generous
Meanwhile: Hello! :)
One does not simply stick around after 3 wipes.
I like that Heroic raids sometimes add new phases to fights
HAPPY BIRTHDAY LED ZEPPELIN
TOO MANY DRUIDS!!!
why would you leave after three wipes?
Where's my combat res? We used it on the shaman. Whyyyyyyyyyy.
pony_1286: there can't be too many druids.
i did that i'd be outta my guild quicker than rain in thed esert
Tbh I think this is more of a PuG discussion
bah
Since leaving in the middle of a guild raid is for only the most lowly of douchebags.
http://jayisgames.com/games/the-house-2/
My guild wasnt bad..... but they Constantly gave away my raid spot =_=
With the exception of that one guy whose dog caught fire.
Ragnaros actually gets up and moves in Heroic firelands
Does anyone know how mana is raised in MoP
Intelegence no longer does that
LFR is utter shit
My raid scedual is shot to hell thanks to school
