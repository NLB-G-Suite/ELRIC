Randomnerd: Spray and Pray!
/me giggles
reminds me of ork logic in a dark heresy campaign I played..."as long as the greenskin believes it works it does" ...i may have had a gun that had infinite ammo and never needed rerolling because he believed it would work :3
da red onez go fasta
Why would they let you play an ork?
The game is about the Inquisition.
thats how the orks work period Arentius... its Pinkie Pie logic :D
best logic
me and my friends like being evil, we just used the dark heresy system
08,01Arentius: dari heresy! \o/
08,01*dark
08,01oh god, i think i pinged him...
Yay!
though...when my friend killed a greater demon with a single pistol shot it was like...what
Arethius: The infinite ammo was actually from your headband
lol dari heresy... that would be hilarious
08,01HE COMETH
Orks aren't evil, just... brutal.
And cunnin'
orks are space mushrooms that will eat you
lol
Just finished playing MW3...
Tun on stream...
more CoD
and then they will eat the rest of your face
Or is it "Cunnin', but brutal"?
Lagmobile: better than MW2?
Why is it everywhere o.o?
Its pretty much the same
08,01oh, speaking of games, did you hear that blizzard are putting in Tauren rogues for MoP?
Gork is cunning but brutal, while Mork is brutal but cunning!
tbf, if i had the money I'd make a brettonian army, as its a known fact mounts do more damage than the riders
Lagmobile: awwww
Just all the weapons are so nerfed that its balanced
1,3cows are not sneaky
Tauren rouge... <_< >_> nope... cant find the MASSIVE COW!
ever
Arentius: I like the Brettonians, though I'd rather play Nuln!Empire
With each regiment named for a class.
1,3except for that one that snuck up on Arentius and tipped him over while he was sleeping >.>
Heyall
eh I don't like the mpire...I tended to shred them with my elves

maleanoma is... what? skin cancer i believe and ebola is a bacteria that can kill you very painfully
Om nom nom
omg....calzone, i miss it
though...what I'm really craving is a vindaloo
Randomnerd: that's the good stuff.
...mfw i get random hunger strikes at 4:20am
Vindaloo is pretty awesome

My friend's mother made this awesome curry chicken

Ok well I got stuff to do bye everyone
I have returned Bronystate! Dark Souls has not fully consumed me (or at least not yet)!
bai SkilledSkillet
OMG guys! star trek online is nao free to play :O
Midnight_Tempest, may i remember i come from NZ where we go crazy 4 tha internet?
Just in time to say bai SkilledSkillet
Bai SS
What big MMORPGs aren't free to play anymore? WoW and TOR are the only two I can think of
EmeraldChocolate: tis but a joke my dear, also... i wanna go to NZ T__T
better
enope
just wait TOR will go free to play eventually
damn you derpy wifi adapter!
it was more of a sarcastic shock
11,01Anyone want to help me test my channel before I ask to stream up?
sure?
how can we help?
Doubt it midnight, its just as good as wow and appeals to the scifi fans
Oh Midnight, it's beautiful here.. sadly, we had an oil spillage on our beautiful ocean.
With the money EA has in TOr it's gonna be a looooong time
11,01Well, I have problems streaming sound.
Orly?
did you turn on the volume?
Tor is doing very well for itself atm
:D
11,01I hope EA loses a ton of money over ToR.
Midnight_Tempest: I c wut u did thar..
<-- is overly excited for tomorrow's rainbow dash episode. :>
..why Nittany
11,01I hate them.
Dashie_Dashie: 'cause granny smith is best pony?
Nittany_Discord that wont be hard since a prediction said that EA spent 500 million in TOR
lolwat
wut
RAINBOW DASH EPISODE?!?! wub wub wub <3
I'd love sources for that
Inglorious: Rift.
saturday is RD episode... its gonna be awesome
Dashie_Dashie: u mean the day after tommorrow?
11,01Of course, EA will compensate by siphoning more money from consumers.
^
it's friday for me.
I find it reeeeallly hard to believe. $500 million is way to much for EA
Same here Dashie,
OH
Rift's cheaper than TOR or WoW, though, which allows it to survive.
kirzstryfe: I'd lol.
^
NO kirz! NO!
It must be all RD!
kirzstryfe, hasbro best be trolling.
lego universe destroys all of those games
I want a scootaloo episode
So do I
Wrong. It's gotta be about Fluttershy.
I hope Vinyl gets some dialogue and outshines RD~
^
Fluttershy!
^LOL
remember everypony: Being and RD episode doesn't make it automatically great.
remember Mare-Do-Well?
eenope
WHAT'd i miss?
MahBoi777: Double "^" fail
You cannot outshine RD. She is 20% cooler than all of the other ponies.
out of all the mane 6, Fluttershy has the least episodes.
^
HI IM BACK
She needs more.
indeed
Know what RD needs? Character. HA
inb4 flame.
Hi, Rainbowdash_16.
HAllo
RD is fine

We just need more Fluttershy.

>.>
Waddup. BTW I came to say i'm leaving forever.
<.<

Dashie_Dashie: YES.

I agree we're overdue for a Fluttershy ep. Then again, she's still got more than AJ, even with the last 2 eps.
:O Rainbowdash_16
Wait what?
*I back you into the wall and continue to kiss you, slipping my tongue into your mouth*
Don't go, Rainbowdash_16

Seriously though. Nobody has EVER tried to say Derpy is some kind of mockery of the mentally disabled. Ever. Most don't even presume that she has any mental disabilities, and those that do NEVER try and make a joke out of it, or inslut her.

She is kind of a role model for being a character we love for her just being...DERPY :D
08,01yeah, poking fun at someone mentally disabled goes against bronyism

did hasbro say something about derpy?
inb4 derpy demonstrates a high level of compentcy in something, she actualy seems like that kind of character

/me hugs everypony back
#bronystate

SuperBrony64: a little while back, aparently its not in my chat anymore
superbrony i pasted that pic on accident
10,02Okay, but that's your last warning Hazard3
then ill be banned?
derpy may potentially be having her name forcibly changed due to some people misunderstanding "derp" to mean a slang against mentally handicapped people rather than someone who messes things up, is silly and/or accident prone
SuperBrony64: tell me a story pwease?
omg......
products on welovefine have had their names changed from derpy and the itunes ep for the last roundup has been removed
well wats the new name?
ill tell u a story
10,02Well, if you post another gore image after you were warned before for posting it, then yes, it's a ban.
I doubt it will be changed :p It's kinda canon now
SILLY FILLIES
what are you guys are talking about?
herostar - it'll probably be Ditzy Doo
TIS I
>.>
/me hugs Hazard3
13thought ditzy was her canonical name and production staff just switched to derpy internally, prior to last roundup anyway
I don't want it changed even though I prefer Ditzy Doo.
/me Group hug
/me 08,01puts Hazard3 onna head
10,02I know it was an accident though, so I understand.
no shizuka, she never had a canon name until the last round up
and that's bad? sounds cute, bu i do agree. his poition has been signed in full :)
my favorite drug is helium
Haven't them change it is bowing down to pressure, which is a slightly slippery slope.
potition*
13not even the mention in... winter wrap up was it?
i love muffins
08,01Hazard3: there's another channel where it's okay to post that, but i'm not allowed to advertise it
interesting.. but I'll raise you a fluttergiant.
http://i.imgur.com/TvktE.gif
the large majority of bronies want it to stay
Winter Wrap up didn't actually present her name; more likely it was just some random other pony :p
sorry my lapop has a bad keyboard. if i mispell anyhing it's the keyboard.
:3
/me Drops book on group, somehow picks it up immediately to same page. Aww yeah.
hate the taste of most but still forcibly eat them because of how derpy likes them too
and t is the wors -_-
Shizuka: can you tell me the story of the barnicle before I go to sleep?
Cause Derpy is proof of our existence
and Shizuka, no, in winter wrap up ditzy was never shown and referred to at the same time
Shizuka: well, we never actually SAW who "Ditzy Doo" is. Just a mention of a pegasus who went north instead of south.
fff-
Even when were gone, We still have....DERPY
I thought parents were e-mail Hasbro demanding an apology for Derpy's character.
ohai herostar
13but everyone assumed that meant derpy, and we called her derpy anyway
its assumable that it was meant to be derpy, but it was not canon
hello Phase4
And I think they said "Deal with it."
Or someone did.
we called her derpy because of her eyes
RAWRity: the internal team called her ditzy and then switched to derpy because of us
hi herostar
hey MahBoi777
it would be actually insulting to call her that
08,01giant yellow horse
10,02Shizuka is a silly filly :3
Nittany_Discord: where is your color?
13i don't think this will change fanon at all, we'll be incensed for a while over someone whining enough to get a retcon, but then back to derpy as usual
...I need the link to the image board that first came up wth the name :D
and people hav emisunderstood and said we're making fun of mentally handicapped people
Disabled it for lulz.
Well, we are...DUH!
Disabled people are HIlarious
i party like SCOOBEH
My god are you serios Nittany_Discord? Some parents protested?
GAH! The slinkie landed on my dick!
shizuka, every time she comes on though, if shes talked to, it wont be derpy anymore, it would always be ditzy or something, or she might never get a speaking part again
should i buy a derpy t-shirt?
word to my mama im out of my lama!
I heard that.
You know guys, it could also be a legl issue since Hasbro does not own the rights to the name Derpy...
13so?
08,01KetaminaDianePie: i don't think it was parents, i think it was bornies
Might be a rumor.
*legal
bluestrom_S: i would say no, they changed the name from derpy to other various names
www.youtube.com/watch?v=sryqaS07WaU best dubstep ever
or is a marketing thing from hasbro or etc..
i would not buy one until the issue has been resolved
i agree PartyCannon
huh, apparently Jay-Z has described himself as "the new Sinatra" "rap's Grateful Dead" and "the black Axl Rose". Huh.
good
Phase4 :3
Phase4 i agree
08,01well, i've always presumed her name is Ditzy, but Derpy is a nickname
stupid F:[ing tab
im in seneca.. although not a special ed program, and beleive me, there are 12-yr-olds in collegue in my school, and im 15 and ALREADY have a itt tech invite, we do not think derpy is a word for "retarded or mentally challenged"
^
/me 13,01hopes Derpy returns.
although i allso agree with Hazard3
Nittany_Discord: Shizuka is going to kill you
Compomise: Derpy is her nickname, Ditzy is her real name :P
tab can be silly

13i am confuse
http://www.change.org/petitions/hasbro-studiosthe-hub-do-not-change-derpys-name#

11,01Well, I can type %C to get the color previews
13oh.. that he used my color...
so now we jus agree to let her name be changed? what happened to that historical moment when she upstaged applejack?
11,01His colorful pants fall down, but nobody laugs.
11,01*laughs
:|
hahaha Nittany_Discord
13eman i am not so quick to dispense high energy particle devastation from orbit
u seen that?!
DeadlyDerp3: simple, some people who have their own preconcieved notions about the term "Derpy" took offense and started their personal crusade to try and have their way.
11,01I've seen everything FiMFlamFilosophy has put out.
they need to suck it up RAWRity
herostar: ikr?
Well, Hasbro can't market it as Derpy if we want an actual thing
11,01The new RDB Presents should be out shortly.
Shizuka: and yet you will on me just for shiggles?
they need to suck it up and best of all
13i do not :<
Deal With It
Shizuka: you DID...at some point
i thought i was ignored again.. thank you so for the response, MahBoi777 that really ment something...
hey i signed it :D!
It's either we keep the name and no merchandise and possibly no major role, Or change the name :P
they could focus on the older bronies with derpy merchandise
I do not forget all the injustice that has ever been commited against me
emantrollslayer: pretty sure that was Sumica who did that.
DO NOT WANT
brb im watchin utube
I don't think kids would be interested in a background pony
Well, Kids are very observant
theres supposed to be a poneh who makes wine
....
They would pick out what's really cool to them :D
herostar: no prob lol
RAWRity: nope... I remember it was Shizu
kids dont like mlp that much............
And Derpy has kinda been a sort of comical character :3
only peoples above 10 like it...
my ten year old bro watches the show and he knows about the background ponies
god damn am I so tired
eman go to bed
thats a different story.....
so.....a new name for "Derpy?"
why?
Derpy Doo?
rofl
he likes it cause you like it TopHat
Ditzy Derpy Doo?
I got it! Here's her new name
derpy is canon now, why change it?
Reta*********ker
bleh.
Great name, HUH!/
I guess I'm going to sleep everypony
cya emantrollslayer
night emantrollslayer
I still contest that if you think "Derpy" is a slur against the mentally disabled, you must conclude that the name "Jackie" is a slam against chronic masturbators.
11,01Ditzy Esmeralda Doo?
Hazard3: oh u
lol

Phase4: perfect
TopHat Doo

Shizuka: can you tell me the barnicle story?
Rawrity said it :(!
DeadlyDerp3: and you got it in your mind that it was right to repeat is just because RAWRity saiid it?
and apparently Rocky is offensive to people who have worked in rock quarries
UGGHH note, difference the real cigarretts and the choc. lookalikes you jus got from pier 39... it's not fun to light chocolate up for a smoke... UGGHH
...It's not offensive!
RAWRity: how bout tom?
13also offensive to boxers amirite rawrity
DeadlyDerp3: If RAWRity denounced Rarity as his favorite chaacter would you to?
....Maybe
soooo everything is offensive now?
^
of course!
herostar: huh?
13i'm offended that you're offended
Shizuka: are you kidding? Balboa was a great boxer! and like, 3/6 movies were decent!
and emangamer is offensive to everypony because he is a jackass

what about my mail??!?!?!?

hahahahahahaaha Phase4 :D!
DeadlyDerp3: HERE COMES TOM
trudat emantrollslayer
I mean, if you're going to assume that Derpy being clumsy means she's mentally disabled, and that they were mocking them, I guess Rarity's cleanliness and Twilight's orderliness are slams against OCD patients.
OH Snap, SLAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
y'all are still on derpy? =/
and Pinkie's hyperness is a huge offense to people with ADHD all of a sudden.
*Motions with hoof*
RAWRity: rarity's cleanliness?
and cider? WUT ABOUT CIDER?!?!?!?!
/me slams Slinkie up and down on Rawrity*
RAWRity: you think her voice made them think that it was offensive?
where. the fuck. do i go. to change ALL 500 OF MY FUCKIN GAME ACCOUNT EMAILS!!!!!
I feel like i should be getting pings, but I dont
XD

08,01KetaminaDianePie: the guy who wrote that committed suicide
Are these all recorded or actually being played live o.o
08,01which reminds me of another funny computing story
DeadlyDerp3: u lucky thing u
i also used to make installazion programs with that
08,01who here has heard of ReiserFS?
so the flashplugin just crashed spectaculary on my browser
nope
There seems to be a curious ferment about the name and/or persona of Derpy Hooves. Anyone have any actual details?
what a story mark
Don't ask Rawrity about it Kencolt
it hates small files aparently
08,01it's a filesystem that was heralded as the up and coming new "does everythign" file system for linux
"And everyone's quit 'til you offer them a cigarette. Before we learn our lesson, let's see how bad things can get."
08,01lots of distros were using it
08,01until one day...
...God came :D?
Kencolt: RAWRity can tell you
08,01the guy who maintained it decided to go bonkers and murdered his wife
"and then Everypony CAME!"
Ouch.
hahaahahaahahahahaha
DeadlyDerp3: LOL why not?
"Hahahah, what a story Mark"
Kencolt: essentially some people took offense to the implication that derpy might be mentally challenged, and wrote to hasbro complaining about it, claiming that "Derpy" is a slur against the mentally disabled. This had led to rumors that Hasbro is backpedaling and going to change her name in the show.
:O
"He was just a chicken, Cheep CHEEP CHEEP Cheeep Cheeyaaooo"
NOt the whole derpy thing again...
08,01so when he went to prison for this, there was no-one to maintain and develop resierfs any futher
Oh, dear.
haha
08,01and that's why we all use ext4 now
08,01Placebo: not all that long ago; i think he murdered her in 2006
Man, that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside :)
mfw your NOT KIDDING http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Reiser#Murder_investigation
So, we'd have time machines and lasar gones if he wasn't bat-sh1t crazy?

08,01they're basically a way of doing recursive anonymous functions
wut do them do?
oooooo
la bamba

conga line!
08,01like, say i have a function that takes in a function f and a value n, and performs that function n times

Night Flaria!
night Flaria
08,01you can then anonymously make a function when you call it: do_n_times( function() { do stuff }, 5)
gnight Flaria
08,01that does whatever do stuff is, 5 times
ooooooo
so you dont have to declare it?
08,01because that's where you declare the function, without assigning it a name, it's anonymous
Ah~ So it's a mystery function.
ooooooooooooo
or is it not an object persay
08,01but they're very useful
indeed
havin a good time havin a good time!

sammygotbeatz: but it's not *bad*
argh

either that or look at a picture of fluttershy, that calms anyone down
sammygotbeatz: those are all excellent animes, but Gurren Laggan takes epic to a new level
Definitely worth giving a shot.
that game is so damn aggravating
I'm done with it

there are reasons for the age limit on alcohol

little bits of alcohol are fine though, feel free to try, just dont start chugging beers
mmm... beer
Meh.

if you must drink, make sure you have someone to be responsible for you
Beer is so unrefined.

10,02For my D&P Moment, I watched the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, specifically, Episode 9 ‘Bridle Gossip’. The episode starts off with all the ponies in Ponyville hiding in their houses as an unknown pony foreign to the town arrives. The main character, Twilight Sparkle, is told of various beliefs that this new pony is evil and has intentions of cooking ponies to be
10,2consumed. The pony in question turns out to be a Zebra wearing various kinds of jewelry and has an accent that resembles someone from Africa. Even though the show doesn’t say it, it’s quite obvious that they are depicting the Zebra, named Zecora, as an African lady. While the entire episode was to teach the lesson of discriminating against someone else based off of popular belief and
10,2profiling, it’s interesting the character they chose to depict. It was obvious they were trying to keep people from discriminating against people using an African character.

^^vv<><>
/me is brick'd
08,01i've worked in two; one as an technician, one as a store manager
you know you deserve it!
it was worth it
08,01both tiny little places that drummed up a lot of business
Oh well.. /
08,01but the story i want to to tell you is about the first, when i was just a technician
ugh...im bored...
/me sits on floor for story
08,01this was about 3 years ago, or so
Oh boy, story!
08,01i had originally started workign there to do mobile phone unlocking and repairs
/me uses sv_cheats 1 and noclips through the chat
/me turns down lights to make it a ghost story
whoooooo
spoooooky
oooOoooOoooooOh~
OOOOOOoooooOOOooo
:D
needs moar zombies
go on...
inb4 brains.
08,01the guy who ran the place asked "what experience have do you have?" and i had replied "i've never used any of the hardware or software you have, but when i was 15, i designed my own interface hardware for the nokia 3310"
08,01thus securing my job
win
08,01anyhoos, as i worked there, we got to know each other better
08,01me and the store owner
inb4 clopfic
^
:D
08,01he was this jolly, fat, turkish guy with a brighton accent
08,01loved his comic books and astronomy; we got along famously
10,029 minutes!
:)
GOGOGOGO SBBBBBBBBB
08,01i became somewhat renowned in that shop as the guy who could "fix anythign or break everythign"
/me watches SuperBusy64 from his window O______O
back again -_-
wb :)
08,01the guy who owned the place, Geoff, referred to me as his "favourite paki"
daaaaawwwww
08,01whcih i decided not to take offence at
08,01anyhoos, the incident that springs to mind was just before i left there
08,01as my thing there was generally phone unlocking, i'd taught myself much about phone security
oh sap! wario land!
64: 7 minutes. No pressure.
08,01but there was one resource i was reliant on in order to get some of the flash files and software i needed
08,01Placebo: that's another story entirely ;)
:D
08,01but these guys were... not the nicest
dat sudden ending
how's the whole psychology thing goin?
08,01they were local, and had decided one day to team up with out main rival across town in a smear campaign against us
Those bastards.
:O
:O!
gotta love those smear campaigns... jerkoffs
08,01unfortunately for them, they were up against a nerd with a chip on his shoulder
/me not sure if figurative or literal chip..
08,01both
:D
i c w u d t
08,01i love potatoes
wait wut.

08,01so geoff asked me if i could "investigate" their website
...
aka, hack it
^
lol
saucy story GOGOGOGO!
Sh*t's getting real now
08,01long story short, just because they can reinstall windows, doesn't mean they keep their websites patched
Lol.
:D
Please tell me this story ends with Geoff going to work for RvB.
brilliant
:D
xD
08,01what ensued was a short, but successful defacement campaign
owwww you
08,01also, remember the phone guys who i mentioned earlier?
Yeah?
:D
ftp?
10,02Done! :D
SuperBusy64: Hooray~

They used many stereotypes of an African culture to depict Zecora especially with some of the African masks used in her hut and the similar language used to that of African tribes. An article I found online helped

Jedi ninjas.

and then goddam chat derps again
damn
One of the reasons I'm happy I switched to mIRC KetaminaDianePie. :P
wheres SuperBusy64 stream?
i should do that too Lasharus.........
I don't think he IS streaming.
its just im too damn lazy :P
10,02Sorry, setting up
those damn jedi ninjas
He sort of renamed himself to SuperBusy64, so I vaguely suspect he's... well, busy.
Oh.
Or he's setting up the stream and I've missed the mark COMPLETELY.
:)
/me glomps Lasharus :3
whatcha gonna stream?
I feel silly now.
He was busy
/me hugs SuperBrony64.
10,02U IS SO SILLY :3

Did anyone watch that? twas awesome..
wow... that ending... :D
Sorry, just me channelling my inner Robotnik. I have to be somewhat evil to keep up with my quota.
lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt
^
this grenade kill..
call of DOOTY... >_< stupid series
^ wub.
Heh.
I tend to avoid the greyish-brown shooters, overall.
Give me either something silly or something with a brilliant plot.
so Gears of War?
Plus.. it's on the wii.
Halo has pretty colors :3
(I.e. Serious Sam or BioShock)
Lasharus that phrase made you one of my favourite :)
bioshock is a good game, but i suggest playing System Shock 2... cause it is so much better
The 'grim 'n gritty realistic army-style shooter' doesn't even remotely interest me.
And thank you KetaminaDianePie. :P
So I'm repeatedly told Midnight_Tempest, but it's a bitch getting a copy :(
pirate bay, my friend
(the greyish-brown one :))
10,02i liek poniez :3
I'll wait for Mass Effect, thank you.
64: no wai!
ME3... MUST HAVE!
^^
Yeah, a working copy Midnight_Tempest. :P
10,02Dat blue one with the white coat and the glasses...i liek dat pony :3
hmmm, yes ponies indeed!
Rarity?
/me trollface.
10,02:<
/me slaps Placebo.
Vinyl
Sorry, reflex.
10,02;____;
Lasharus: ive always managed to get working copies of game from pirate bay... thats where i got my version of System Shock 2
:<
/me hugs Placebo
wub.
It always seems to happen when people reference those rageface things.
You are a pirate~
I can't really control it.
Yar Har fiddle dee de.
Fair enough Midnight_Tempest, but I never got it working :P
>.>
Pirate Bay is an awesome site
Lasharus: Okayface.
I'm waiting for Gog.com to pick it up.
Do what you want cause a Pony is free, you are a p-o-ny!
Pirate Bay........
/me restrains himself with difficulty.
"fight harder"
Winning 1350 to 550.
My country blocked Pirate Bay a year ago :((((((((((((((((((((
10,02Did something happen to Derpy today? :S
i would have thought Gog.com would have it by now
/CoD logic
Hardly surprising.
SuperBrony64: We had a huge fight over whether or not derpy is an offensive name.
08,01the guys who ran pirate bay didn't get their sentences reduced :(
10,02It's not an offensive name ;___;
I blame RAWRity
Nah Midnight_Tempest. GoG.com is sort of stuck with the companies they work with, and they do have to jump through hoops to get some things running.
Oh dear, the "Derpy = offensive" debate?
Rawrity argued with himself for like, 30 minutes on it.
>.>
calling derpy offensive is an insult
lol
I'm in the middle, myself. I can understand some may find it mildly offensive. On the other hand, I'm strongly offended by pulling it off the air.
:( I need the huggz
To repeat myself, and pardon me for swearing in advance:
yeah what's going on with derpy? welovefine doesn't call her derpy anyore and the episode is off itunes?
I fucking HATE political correctness!
With a blinding passion.
Lasharus: Bucking*
tophat: does someone need a hug?
is that all we know? Has anyone actually said it's because it's offensive?
yes please
Apparently so Funkballs.
I move that we set aside the Derpy debate
TopHat: *hugs* hugs bring happiness :333
It's so immensely tiresome.
10,02I don't want them to rename Derpy... ;___;
in favor of group hug with TopHat
:)
You literally can't do a bloody thing without SOME interest group going up in arms.
10,02i need a hug too ;___;
Funkballs....that's a hilarious name, just saiyan
/me tacklehugs SuperBrony64.
SuperBrony64: I brought you a puddin cup
10,02:D
hugz all round
/me hugs SB64
/me noms on puddin cup :3

you dont want them to change Derpy's name... SIGN THIS PETITION!

Group hug in the shower tonight~
10,02O___o
O_o
Or not.
O__o
or not.
I'm not going to bother signing a petition for it Midnight_Tempest.
>.>
DOOO EEETTT
*faints*
O__________o
yeah...let's start a petition on reddit
ಠ_ಠ
The only reason i'm opposed to them changing it is because they're doing it in the name of PC.
I liek derpy ;.;
same here ;w;
PC?
Eh, as far as I'm concerned, the name "Ditzy" and "Derpy" are interchangeable.
derpy is fine the way she is... leave her alone ;A;
Political Correctness KetaminaDianePie.
oooooooo
She made it painfully clear that Ponyvilles contruction is not up to standards.
PC suks asss...... as always
> mac
Goodnight guys
c w i d t?
10,02If they rename Derpy to Ditzy I'm going to stop watching the show.
Night cucap
HA!
ಠ_ರೃ
he's gone. lol
nightcupcake
Oh noes..
SuperBrony64 - I call bullshit. :P
SuperBrony64: I have to stick around untill at least Feb 11th..
owwwww SB :(
same here
I must know.
leave derpy alone
^ lol
Oh fine I'll join the argument
here we go again...............
10,02I'm firm on that stance, I will not continue to watch the show if they rename her to Ditzy.
;.;
I honestly don't care what they do
What will your name change to?
hmmmmm......
They probably wont even mention derpy again in the show anyway
do you know pokemon?
I think it'd be best if they just didn't give her more dialogue. She had her moment, let it remain glorious in our memories.
10,02My middle name!
they did the same thing.........
SuperDanger64?
10,02Butter
toast
many times trough the years........
/b/utter?
10,02I guess I really won't stop watching the show...
but i still love them
To be honest SuperDanger64 - I don't think it's worth getting into a huff over. That's what STARTED this idiocy.
SuperButter64?
SB is now SB.
it's canon.
People are, by and large, idiots. Know that you're above that level, and try to move on.
10,02But I don't want them to call her anything but Derpy.
Don't force yourself to stop doing something you enjoy because of something so relatively insignificant.
And half the fanon out there calls her Ditzy.
They will keep calling her that in fanfics at least...
It hardly matters.
well stilll call her Derpy......
they originally called her ditzy though... in the winter wrap up episode
just look at Equestria: Total war.
as we still think about jinx as black
Derpy Ditzy Ditzy Derpy Dotzy Dingy whoopty doo
ALL her names are fanon in it.
lol.
and not purple
mfw I've been reading dramatic readings of clopfics for 2 hours
what are we talking about derpy for?
SB brought it up.
because we can, i guess
>.>
/me noms last puddin' cup
/me noms on Placebo
O__O
...
I'm okay with this.
/me waits for reaction
*sips tea*
tastes like pudding

hi mom!
It's a bit how I think of matters when it comes to Dr. Robotnik Midnight_Tempest.
Some people still prefer Robotnik, many others go with Dr. Eggman.
thats RoBUTTnik Lasharus
i cant read the blue text
Wut
I prefer Robotnik, but I'll accept that the names are interchangeable.
/me smacks Midnight_Tempest upside the head.
I heard speach.
Some names are NOT acceptable, however.
gah!
You forget you address the Robotnik-fanboy of BronyState.
it will always be RoBUTTnik to me!!! T__T
/me smacks Midnight_Tempest upside the head.
/me joins in the smacking

Tophat: I need me some tacos!
That is beautiful
10,02For my D&P Moment, I watched the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, specifically, Episode 9 ‘Bridle Gossip’. The episode starts off with all the ponies in Ponyville hiding in their houses as an unknown pony foreign to the town arrives. The main character, Twilight Sparkle, is told of various misconceptions that this new pony is evil and has intentions of cooking ponies to
10,2be consumed. The pony in question turns out to be a Zebra wearing various kinds of jewelry and has an accent that resembles someone from Africa. Even though the show doesn’t say it, it’s quite obvious that they are depicting the Zebra, named Zecora, as an African lady. While the entire episode was to teach the lesson of discriminating against someone else based off of popular belief
10,2and profiling, it’s interesting the character they chose to depict. It was obvious they were trying to keep people from discriminating against people using an African character. They used many stereotypes of an African culture to depict Zecora especially with some of the African masks used in her hut and the similar language used to that of African tribes. An article I found online helped
10,2history of black people being used as slaves and thus these stereotypes have originated since.
:O
TopHat: ikr

oh this, I posted this video
how can he do that he cant see or feel the keys
that was me
or just download and configure an IRC client
dat logo............
oh, never noticed that chat button there
:O
cosplay and music huh?
00,10Nico nico medily
omg
OMG
yes
ah, should've known
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!
dat spiderman
00,10filmed on a potato
ryuseigun!!!!!!!!!!!
00,10thought you would like this KetaminaDianePie
:D!
08,01guys, i have a PSA
00,10fire bad?
08,01you know when you're browsing the web, and you go to an SSL encrypted site
yeah?
well that didn't work
08,01sometimes the browser will pop up a message saying the certificate isn't valid, or that there's no certificate, for whatever reason
ohai everypony
i kinda have 3 different versions of this.....
08,01if it does that, and you're paranoid, treat the connection as unencrypted
hey Jim
but not this one :D!
apple!
may I ask what is on the stream? o_O
hi jin
jim
wait
i know this music
dat bad apple
bad apple?
08,01i just sniffed my brother's paypal password from a supposed "secure" connection using a wifi man in the middle attack, combined with an SSL MITM with a fake certificate
is this the current medley they're using now?
it seems KetaminaDianePie is enjoying this at the moment, good for him
:DDDDDDDD
sniffed?
10,02Your brother has lost all privaleges on the internet, go take away his internet card.
00,10dem mitm attacks
00,10no this was the first medley
/me continues on homework
08,01Phase4: i poisoned the ARP cache of the networks (which technically i didn't *have* to do, since I have access to the router), redirected traffic to myself, set up my own natting using iptables, and filtered his traffic through sslsniff using a fake certificate i generated
awwwwww listen....... at the reprise........
Sleep? Lawl. FAAAAR too mainstream
08,01*network
08,01Phase4: yeah, it probably popped up an error, and he clicked through it
xD
08,01most people ignore these things
that works i supose
08,01so yeah, don't
08,01also, never let me on your wifi network :P
00,10never ingnore the warnings
08,01Sumica: aye, if it's somethign important
08,01lawl
10,02Can I have a job at your business Sumica? D:
i arp poisoned a computer at tafe once, so easy
umm was that one guy humping the air?
i think the command is actualy called arppoision
ha
00,10I mic spam the meetingservice guys with pony music and my iphone
08,01the only network i know that actually signs their encryption (thus preventing an ARP poison like i did) is my uni network
nope. arpspoof
awesome Sumica ^^
08,01and not the normal uni network, only the CS network
00,10cause they dont secure the radios
lol
Sumica: That's a win
at tafe they used norton ghost to distribute images
00,10and well the cctv's and projecters have pony clips at least once a week
08,01basically, you shout out to the network "yeah man, i'm the router, honest, send me all your traffic"
^
:O
sadly I think they are trying to get Sumica back for the pony stuff
he keeps getting hurt at work :'(
anyway, they use norton ghost over a samba/cifs/whatever its called share
directory was writeable
/me puts on intelligent glasses on and continues work
hotsauce
damn said on twice...
never actualy did anything with it, files we're individualy wirte protected, but depening on how norton works (started looking into it and got bored) i might have been able to inject things into the image
intelligent glasses don't work!
is this... smilian?
00,10wonder how many reconise the songs
lol
dat gradius
^^vv<><>ba
08,01i'm currently trying to make an attack where i spoof firefox into accepting a spurious update
08,01but i'm not sure if that's possible
this one yes!
i assume the're signed somehow
That was one awesome video
08,01but the goal there is to update firefox with bogus certificates
08,01again, using MITM
/me puts on intelligent hat and works
10,02Newsletter is going out! :D

Yes. Your super nes was WRONG.
It's not really that confusing Starflash.

But they used it is the 6th in the series in the end.
They didn't release every Final Fantasy in the US, whereas they did in Japan.

So I'm just casually checking for areas of protest in Denmark, and I find out that there's one a 10 minute train ride away. IT BEGINS
next time it happens i'l show you what it prints to the screen
oh that text lag thing?
not text lag, the chat (or at least a single room) dies completly
portal!
you can send sucesfully but nothing is displayed after the msg that breaks it
curious
i'l remember to screenshot it next time
00,10that's why I like a stand alone irc
Sumica: there are ways to crash those by sending certain things too...
MakerDusk: i uncover all sorts of bugs, like this one wich i got a recording of http://youtu.be/SYgsMUYAJac?t=8m30s

Or, rather, what is Watership Down?

Aha.
So anyway, I hope my German teacher is a brony.
Kammerjunk: Watership Down is a book/film about rabbits who murder each other
Because she's about to get a pony story.
ScootaChicken: wat
eeyup.
and its rated U in the UK

Never saw it.

Yes.
Yes, it is.
Amongst others.
Not the-fic-that-shall-not-be-named, though
That was just silly.

A second meetup is planned here in Denmark, but it's in the very far corner of the country.

Sweet dreams, Phase4.

At the last meetup I went to and the very first in Denmark, we couldn't go to Toys'r'Us, the closest being a few miles away and all.
hello
Kammerjunk, do you have anything like the London Underground in Denmark?
I mean obviously you have trains
We have a few metro stations.
But nothing like in the UK.

Hi
whats that
It's probably not the same if you haven't played zelda games
hi Yellowquiet
Cello Yellowquiet
hey jim
09,01not a Zelda spinoff. Even if Pietoro DOES look like Link....but he was created in the 70's so he actually predates Link
09,01also
09,01>has Dragon Blood
copied from skyrim
09,01he was Link AND the Dovahkiin years before it was cool
I'll give it a chance
Um... if he's drawn from a PS1 RPG, then he can't predate Link, who comes from the original NES "Legend of Zelda" game?

09,01DYNAMIC ENTRY
Dat face
lol What is this?
I just randomly joined the stream and I'm like "lolwtf."
THis is one of those shows that we would find charming but would never have flown inthe US at the time.
09,01yeah, pretty much.
In the palm of his haaaaaaaaaand.
09,01DAT ECONOMY
Most important part of an evil scheme, make it economical
Oh, a budget minded loony. I like that.
I'm Epona btw.
MOAR POWAH!!!
I like booms.
This is the kind of thing that never ends well.
I love it when the Moon and the Sun are visible at the same time.
It reminds me of Luna and Celestia.
^^
Fluttershy is crying somewhere...
09,01by the way, is the audio okay?
Yeah, its fine
That kid looks like Link.
09,01yeah, he does. But he was created earlier than Link, so he's not a copy
great. He's invented an orbital laser deforesting system. What's economical about that?
The real estate will be through the roof!
That's the economical value!
09,01ECONOMICAL ROBOT
I'm enjoying watching this. I like it
09,01...with creepy nipples
Optimus Prime That Ain't.
Transformer
nipple cannons
wut
Of COURSE he doesn't know that bit.
09,01AND NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO DISABLE A ROBOT
This shows, that running away is good
What show is this?
ZOMBIE!!
09,01PoPoLoCrois Monotagari

^
ahhhh
thy ^^
09,01as in, (before someone else says it)
09,01and
stream quality is really great
More often, in before a predictable result happens.
This makes me think of that Japanese fluttershy So Many Wonders that EQD posted last night.
thy ^^
09,01Owncast is what we used to use...they got Taken Down, and recently got taken back up
09,01the problem with Owncast is that sometimes they're doing mainteinance or something and then they start derping like crazy
ah.
nice
that is soooo windwaker link.
>.>
09,01and smoothness....well, I'm just the most experienced streamer so far, since I taught the other guys to stream...so I got more techniques and ways to make it look better
Dashie_Dashie: I was thinking that. xD
NewDCD: is best stream.
09,01'cept PoPoLoCrois Manga = 1978
makes me wonder..
seems legit
the developers for windwake might have got the idea for the toon-ish link from this show
waker*
SKYRIM
Wind waker was fun~
Gamecube. Lol
well excuss me princess!
I miss my black gamecube
:c
excuse*
09,01maybe. 'cept the PoPoLoCrois games have been on Sony Consoles (PS, PS2, PSP)
Wut? dragon-kind?
PoPo is... dragonborn.
09,01I think Sony developed them
It's no worse than pony genetics.
09,01and yeah, he IS Dragonborn
09,01BEFORE IT WAS COOL
SOOOO MUCH DAWWWWWWW: http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyt6xqrebE1r878jto1_500.jpg
PoPo is a hipster.
Hipster anime. lol
09,01also you mean Pietoro
oh. My bad.
09,01PoPoLoCrois is the name of the kingdom
09,01Popolo from Populum, People
09,01Crois from Croix, or Crossing
And He's Price Tuna Pie-- I mean Pietoro.
09,01so "The Kingdom of People's Crossing"
I knew it started with P, so I took a shot in the dark.

/me wubwubwub
Wub wub wub
09,01I like the eyes
09,01they're cute

They are empty pits of loneliness and despair.
this show is cute
/me feels tempted to drawing Pietoro and Spike
I want to squash it.
skyrim
00,10dont get me wrong dcd it looks great, but that's more doue to you
09,01I love Owncast. When it's not in mainteinance
09,01so it's great for these occasions
00,10yeh just dont try to use it on a tuesday or a saterday
09,01This song still makes me NOSTALGIA for no reason
00,10I will forever hate them though due to the first day of s2 troubles

00,10Hi Poundcake
05GAH
05FROSTBRAND ON MY HAND
05FUCKIGN WEATHER
00,10Morning wrek
Cello Wrek
hi Wrek
oh well hai Wrek
Hello Wrek
09,01Frostbrand sounds like an epic sword
^
00,10want my 95mph winds for a bit?
want my sunshine and 45 degrees?
05want my -34degrees(C) for a week?
Frostbrand sounds like an enchantment you would put upon a sword.
09,01want my endless summer?
I have Sunshine and 600 degree weather :)
I would love 034
i love the cold weather
-34*
Want my 52 degree weather with 20mph winds?
*60
Frostbrand I believe IS a magic sword in final fantesy
-10
Not 600
It's only 0 (32F) here atm
It shows up in a lot of taletop RPG's also...
00,10I find once you get below -10 C I cant tell the drffrence
Nice cool Fall weather is best imo
-10 is where i start feeling it :P
Tabletop RPGs.
34 F here in chicago, warm enough for fog
- 10 no clouds sun and snow
best weather ever
I hate winter
00,10but then again I have goten used to death vally heat so my feeling for cold is a bit dulled
Partly cloudy 34F 8mph winds here.
Discord weather^^
00,10and I complanin at any thing close to freezing
05for 10 minutes i couldnt feel 3 fingers
05and 1 knuckle
haha ^^
where're ya at Dashiex2?
00,10what did you leave that hand outside over night or did you like have that hand exposed when outside?
New yorkz
I just don't get cold easily at all. -34C would be an interesting learning experience. And also mildly hilarious
05i was having a smoke on the way home
00,10good god what happend to link and zeldas eyes?
now you know why smoking is unhealthy wrek
ah, I'd figure it'd be worse given the east coast, but then again we got lake michigan so it's similar
SQUADELA WE ARE OFF!
And there we have it; Smoking causes frostbite
altenrately, it gives you a cool ive-element sword.
ice* 0_o
I'm so hungry, I could eat a octorock
I can't wait to bomb some dodongos!
00,10bleh I dont want to go out in to this wind but I need a haircut badly
So I got to the water temple in Skyward Sword (yeah im goin kinda slow, shaddap). Immediately turned the wii off, went to a friend's house, stayed the night.....haven't touched the wii since. God do i ahte water temples.
haircut emergency?
the water temple in Ocarina is the worst one, although volume wise it's the smallest
00,10it's more of it's a nuasance to have it down to the middle of your back if you work in a kitchen
I'm growing my hair out for Locks of Love
well, i hate water levels in general. t'was actually dire dire docks from mario 64 that caused it.
my hair is taking forever to grow back
i was terrified of that whirlpool.
it's bugging me
I should have had a carpet on my head last month
00,10mine grows too fast
and my hair is long enough to go through my belt ^_^
00,10my last hair cut was around july
mine's not that long Malix, but close
hmmm, thinkin I might go make steak, eggs, and hashbrowns for brunch
poor snake
wait, we got robots now?
so are these people all gnomes or just kids or what?
Only this proto Eggman gots da robots.

He's going under the name kabibi now
And now kabibi is doing it

and here is where something goes wrong
oh crap
thank you,now we can stream in peace
what, otakon?
Wind-Kind
the show
Hey Sleepy Jean, oh what can it mean?
Just wondering, was anyone creeped out with that bot?
yeah XD
Simon: eeyup
i was simon
09,01also
09,01for absolutely NO REASON, enter gluefactory
/me shakes Lulu s hand whilst wearing a tophat "good show ma'a,
it wouldnt stop sending me messages
09,01I think that the reason they're inviting and autokicking
09,01is to get hostname information from IRC users
09,01so avoid it at all costs
Why do you even wanna go some where named Gluefactory?
i dont use IRC ^___^
07,01^
z-line
I'm not using IRC
so I winnn
09,01GlueFactory is the name of the anti-brony operation established a few days ago
09,01so yeah.
Perhaps it's good I wasn't using an IRC client but a webclient.
I accidentally entered for a sec -_-
same here ken
Yup, webclient
can they hurt that too newDCD?
I just continually ignored it
a few days ago?
any IRCops available?
really?
WHY?!
Internet is filled with bad people
their just closet brony's i bet
some spambots around, huh?
Pay no mind to it and contiue doing good
we must love and tolerate them to death!
I don't understand the hate
yep
09,01haters gonna hate
They probably attack for fun
._.
its pretty much the perfect trap
Hmm... My scanner found a very odd browser cookie after entering gluefactory >;l *delete.*
>_>
probably coincidence though.
yeah, i'm banning around a little as well... seems everyone of the staff is either sleeping, shopping, or simply gone
they try to make us mad so we go in,then they steal our IRC stuff
ah
Starflash - what site was the cookie for?
its thunder and storm
errr... PM it to me
Whatever you do DO NOT enter gluefactory
maybe i should delete mine too...
hm, why?
better safe then sorry,right?
guys!
yeah
run your cleaners!
yeah ota?
why?
I think that bot
that's the HQ of their operations
virus?
might have given you something
shiit
> GlueFactory is the name of the anti-brony operation established a few days ago
/me runs a virus scan
anything specific?
No trojans, ofna01.
That's all I know.
09,01nah, I'm more worried they were trying to get information on bronies...that's what was detailed on the Operation Glue Factory document
Their eyes are like piecharts
I didn't go into the gluefactory, but better safe than sorry, ey?
got a link to this doc DCD?
09,01collecting info on bronies and decrypting it....
09,01hold on
i've got mac,would it hurt me?
what in the name of
Vivix creepy piecharts
aww, so cute
yeahh
otakon
09,01http://paste.org.ru/?nyyb10
can I pm you?
sure
09,01that said, hashes take years to decipher, and I'm not exaggerating...years to decypher ONE.
that depends on what it's a hash of man
09,01INCOMING THU'UM IN THREE
09,01TWO
09,01ONE
with rainbow tables a lot of those could take minutes...
or seconds
if it's a long complex password then yeah years
09,01that specific hash would take years, according to the FiMFiction staff
...
What is this
if it's "bestpony" not so long
09,01PoPoLoCrois
Nice
Also
oh god
Ok. Tuna Pie is a kickass tuna pie.
incane clown posse?..wat
Why does every idiotic pony hater think we're furries? *facehoof for stupidity*
these guy's are god damn psycho
Could someone shed some light on the Derpy debacle? Is there some kind of huge controversy or something?
09,01because Rule 34
there is no debacle threw
heyho everypony!
ohai diddutz
careful diddutz
whats wrong with furries
I think they might be revising the voice due to gender buut other than that--I havent heard any hate
Cello diddutz
threwthedoor - there are people that think that the name "Derpy" is insulting to people with mental disabilities
we're on sorta of an alert
Oh
to which, we respond "no it isn't."
alert? because of what?
how pathetic
ALERT ALERT-----just kidding
plain and simple, pathetic.
if standards of broadcasting didnt stop it itll prolly be fine
well
spam bot attack,possible virus sent through here
they have different standards nowadays
everyone's advised to run their anti-virus programs and empty their cookies
eeyup
I didn't even see the spambot
Then again Ive lurked fooor houuurs
you came in right after it was banned
Just did. And I'm on the Cyber Defender program... which is amazingly good.
did you zline them
ken
or just ban them from this one channel
quick question
cookies deleted - check - doublecheck
Kawaii desu ne
good man
I'm not even worried about it, what possible gain could they possibly get from getting my name and information?
I mean seriously.
09,01I think we already watched this episode...let's check.
usually when people steal passwords like this its to use it in your mail or other acces points and try to get your credit etc
your IP,they could shut down your computer permanentley,dashie
What is this?
09,01GaoGaiGar
whered popolacrois go
Okay
was that the end?
I don't have a credit card, so I'm good on that.
here's who we think did it

Auughh epilepsy
I'm not worried though, I dont use important passwords on fimfiction or anywhere else

09,01THAT'S HOW BOSS I AM

smaller channels seem to be fine though...
I get a kick out of this show
son of a whore
I noticed
Guess its another of those "Try to harass the big communities" Things
SOO MANY ROBOTS notallcaps
they didnt sound like human beings
yea it is
hm, dunno... two single bots isn't really harassment imo
/me is getting a mighty Morphing Power Rangers feeling from this
hey NewDCD you have Giant Robo?
Was bronystate thee first who was hit?
that would be a good one to stream
09,01not yet, but SOON
nope
cool
#brony I believe
how long ago did all this happen?
like the spambots
EMERGENCY! rainbowderp` (ohyou@61mg6x55.bb.sky.com) spam
it's fairly short and it's good
seems so, i dunno
yeah
that mom voice
invite spam, and channel flooding
inyl
We know
oh, okay
channel flooding?
VinylScratch: been happening since new years and this group apparently formed just before FimFiction was hacked
thanks :)
yeah
less then 10 minutes ago i'd say
he just pm spammed us
oh jesus.
channel flooding with colourfull non ascii characters
he doesn't really channel flood
my computer is acting weird
he just posts whenever anyone says anything
channel flood in #bronies.cz
uh oh
ah
gonna scan for virus real quick
Tank goodness my Commensense was tingling and didn't join that room
just ban them for now, that stops the pm spam as well
*thank
oh, okay
all the ircops seem to be out at the moment
ignoring him also works
i didnt even join it
Still ran a check anyway
i banned him after first post
09,01FUCK YEAH LIGER IS BEST UNCLE
09,01AND HE HAS PINKIE PIE MUFFIN HAIR
so just being connected to irc is enough for them to do something to people's computers? or would i have had to accept something or join a room? :V
if he catches you in the loop just ignore him it'll autostop his invites/pm spam
my god is he SHORT
then hit him with the B& hammer
VinylScratch: its possible to get a virus just from viewing an image
VinylScratch: they had auto joins
you dont even have to be in IRC
epilepsi
its how I've delt with him in his two bots on #20pc
wth
i got a worm from just being in this chat
09,01DOSE ATTACK DESCRIPTIONS
WTH !?
yeah, just kickban works as well, since he doesn't see what you're typing anymore
Brother fight!!
so the spam stops too
and once again

I wasn't lookin at his crotch obviously
I tapped on it, to tell em to buck off
And that hostmark was banned as a result
um
don't worry bro
did he just diss his creator?
being Gay for Gai doesn't make you gay
yeah, you probably shouldn't do that... the servers have some safeguards in place here
lol
Damn straight
makes you even manlier
learned about that only yesterday, too
it does not appear in the akill list though
because only a true man could be gay for Gai

I don't understand Japanese so everytime I hear D-Boy, I'm like "Say what now?"
yep
but he missed....
that one didnt
what's up with all the mech anime though...
best mech anime was Escaflone
japanese are robophiles
Escaflowne
Mecha is best anime type
even
dont understand why though... japanese women are hot
also we prefer the term "Ryusei"
no woman is as hot as Valsione
and Angelg
is that japanese zoidberg
eh, I only really liked Escaflowne and 08th MS team
SAVE US HE MAN!!!!
and macross if you call that mech
which Macross?
lucky=we lucked out
I know it was 3 different shows in japan
welp good news
RAPE FACE
wow
that sucks
my scan is done
macross, southern cross, and no idea what the third was
nothing found
good ota
Inquisitor: remember any detail about it
it's better to watch Macross and Mospeada separately
I thought he was like 50 ft tall a moment ago?
dunno about Southern Cross
wth???
no
he's like 3m tall
and naked
as a Tekkaman
lol
ofc he's hungry
eh, I just liked the whole SDF Rick Hunter stuff

JSYK, I'll be leaving about half-way through BMN tonight.
wth?
09,01ofna: be careful with posting video links. Don't post them during high-traffic times like movie night or live ep...I don't mind, but make sure to ask the other streamers first. There is a rule about video links in chat.
oh
/me tosses off the nomming Midnight_Tempest
sorry New
I clicked it expecting Rick Roll
09,01as I said, it's fine with me
nuuuuuuuuu T__T

I don't like being nommed!
Some friends and I are going to see "The Woman In Black" tonight, and I'll be leaving around 9 PM EST.
have fun
here's hoping it doesn't suck!
RAWRity: what's that? and have fun while your at it!
BOOOOOOOOOM
is it supposed to be a horror movie or something? never looked up anything on that movie
w....t......f
otakon: it's Daniel Radcliffe's new movie.
Woman in Black is a new horror movie starring the kid who played Harry Potter
hmmm
wait
Morty: incorrect.
why does Daniel Radciffe sound familiar?
yes
09,01otakon: because Harry Potter
harry potter
ah
that's why
... that's what I said
it's a British Horror film.
okay seriously
how is THAT THING cosidered a Dagger?
classic japanese voices
from the classic Hammer Horror Productions
09,01the Tekkaman are just named after weapons like that, not due to the weapons they wield
Brittan banned the movie Grotesque... which is laughably bad...
09,01well, most of them anyways

Wasn't Tekkaman done by Tatsunoko too?
09,01yeah it was
judging from teh animation style I should say Midnight_Tempest
09,01that's why Tekkaman Blade is in TatsuCap

DON'T READ IT!
MahBoi777: ahem gentlemen?

now you have a lag book Wrek
1,3ponies
yeah
omg sounds sooooo much like sloth demon from DAO
it's the book
Wrek: do NOT read it!
you can boost your skills with it!
o rigth thanks :D
hello talking orb of darkness what it do?
Wrek: save for reading it till you get back to your house and a bookshelf!
Dont wrek !
omg hes gonna do it
Do not read!
shield your eyes!
Nooo Wrek
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
omg fail
otakon - they fixed that already
NO!
0,14gah, done with SCV for now
you failed Wrek
Y GOD Y
NO
damn it WREK!
otakon - THEY FIXED that glitch
you just shot yourself in the foot
00,10damn wrek is a hell of a chanter
MirrorImage: when? it still works for my game
why shouldnt he have read it?
ofc I'm only running 1.3
1.3 i believe they did it in
enchanting is overpowered
otakon: it's better than an arrow to the knee
nope
maybe 1.4 then
still works for 1.3
but i swear a patch note said that specific glitch was fixed
wait, why did I wake up?
what glitch?
Morty: there is a glitch that lets you level up all your skills to max
Tophat: for breakfast?
TopHat: dangerous question
Morty - that tomb Wrek just read gives him levels in different skills, then disappears
don't read it!
there's a bookshelf glitch that lets you receive those bonuses multiple times
^^
and he s doin it again
argh!
read ALL thebooks!
no I mean, I usually sleep forever unless awakened by some interference
argh!
TO SKYRIM
Tophat: it was ur destiny to awaken

For those that missed my post this morning, look up ozfoxes webcomic - there's a pony reference in today's strip :)
Cypresswolf :D I am craving chocolate. And you?
canary
I love chocolate
you just made me want choclate
O____O
Im still trying to get FO New Vegas to work
Wrek
put it IN YOUR BOOKSHELF
and read it from there
you can boost you skills to max
00,10they want to you exploite a glitch wrek
THEN
is there a a hiant slaughterfish mod?
you can use it REPEATEDLY
giant*
alright breakfast time
well
option 3, always "Put it in"
max all your skills is fun
No fun.
I'm not saying maxing everything out immediatle
eet eez good day to be giant!
i sware there ore stormcloaks graurding that brige than all of skyrim
Cheating is for the WEAK!
but then you can boost weak skills
that would take FOREVER to level up
And I mean FOREVER
I want to see where the arrow in the knee thing came from
show me!
FOORRREEEEVVVUUUURRRRR
TopHat: its a guard quote
My Skyrim is one big glitch. I still have an ice dragon in East Empire Company :P
otakon - if he's going to glitch like that, then he might as well take the easy route and use the console
but I want to see it
i wouldnt mind a way to get alchemy to 100
that shit levels slow
Morty - buy out every alchemist shop of all its ingredients every time
quite
hi qwerty
hi

uiop

asap
wtf is going on
I HAVE NO IDEA
imo
no
TB;DR
absorb HEALTH!
00,10it's times like this I wish the game was multyplayer so I could join wrek
I've had that book for ages, didnt know it could give you experience. Although it I got that in 5 days of Skyrim being released, so perhaps its been patched
absorb HEALTH!
idk
Cypresswolf: it still works on Xbox
that awkward moment when you get extra enchantment and realize u need all new gear
Skyrim multiplayer would be so awesome
ha!
00,10lawl
FAIL
*snrk*
fail!
lol
ha
/me claps slowly
what happened?
TopHat - he sprinted off a ledge and fell to his death
He shouted himself to death
whitrun is a deathtrap
Wrek: do you ahve the perk that reduces falling damage when your wearing all heavy armor?
00,10slayer of dragons trips and falls down the steps
fail after fail
because you know,e ven at level 40, a 30 foot drop will shatter your legs
didn't look like he fell that far
he fell far enough
if only Fus Ro Dah cud act as a fall damage reducer
just roll when you land
00,10the balls for it?
MahBoi777 - that might've been nice, if he wasn't still recharging his shout after using one to jump off the edge
MirrorImage: lol true
00,10did you just sugest yelling at the ground to reduce fall damage?
I did indeed
Sumica - "Move you stupid Earth! I'm falling here!"
you can buy them in the mage guild
when u fall it calculates height at the begining of the jump. he traveled on an x plane for a while after the jump, making the fall seem small from where he ended up, but to the game he fell from the top of dragonsreach
the hearts
curse you gravity! *shouts*
this reminds me of fable
Morty - actually, about half way
i believe he was at the first landing
00,10Gravity wins; Fatailty
I'm off for a while everypony, there's pizza!
well, you get the idea
Bye Globetrotter
it was bigger than it looked
what is the best place to find deadra in skyrim? Those....baddies with the sharpened stick weapons have some sometimes but those are hard to find
HOLD ON!
bai Globetrotter
Sumica: gravity always wins
lol 41 Deadra hearts no life Wrek ? ;D
just load the auto save!
too late
flawless victory
load your auto save B4 you left your house!
00,10otakon you know werk will never listen to you right?
yeah
What are they called? Theyre not falmer...those woodland tribal people
I don't care
elves?
thank yoU!
and stmaina!
Daedra hearts are easy, just farm the alchemy shops
not banish
banish is WEAK!
and stamina is best for continous power attacks
00,10try reverse psicology otakon
it's worthless
banish sells well
take fire
GODDAMNITDARIbot!
Fire always does the most pure damage if that's what you're looking for
don't read the book = reads book
iron dagger + banish + paralyze = like 1000, 2000 something
Fire is best overall
FIRE IS COOLER!
of course giants toe potions are 4k
no
FIRE
00,10fire>cooler
alchemy shops....ive been going out to slay searching for those all this time (198 hours) and they can be found in shops O_O
Bumtaser 2.0
call it Bumtaser 2.0
FIre is 20 % cooler then frost !!
Fire is hot, it's a fact
Grand=Black
Cypresswolf: yeah, just fast travel between a bunch of different cities and raid the alchemy shops
Bumtaser 2.0!
otakon that made me lol
Dat Bumtazer. I am pleased.
argh!
he never listens!
00,10bumbtazer seems like it should be a staff
"Legendary BumTazer"
Fire
Seriously, farming raw mats is overrated...
Fire Wrek
Absorb Health!
black=grand, white=common, yellow=petty
00,10Farming is for the Chinise
Soul gems? You can run around outside for hours and get a couple, or just have lots of money (from alchemy) and buy them
you re kidding me ^^
level your alchemy from buying out the alchemy shops
dubstep ftw
wub wub wub
wubwubwubw
level smithing from buying out ore... and enchanting from all the iron daggers you make, with soul gems you get lying around
dammit
rainbow factory dubstep, no less
max your tradeskills, abuse potions for temporary bonuses to enchanting/smithing, make godly gear
Hey guys.
Guess what is it.

I suppose you're right.
Not with a black background.
00,10only if you use a white background TopHat
sumi
00,10ofna01

Mods are for colours.
00,10magic

ofna01A: mmmmagic
Wiat, sorry.
or is that for admins only
Colours are for mods.
1,3Wrek has entertainment skill?

guess so kirz
00,10oh any one can use color twice
are admins and mods the same thing?
?
00,10after that dari bot takes you out back
:/
TopHat - more or less
00,10mods, admins, streamers
guess people with background colors are somewhat more badass?
1,3dat hierarchy

okay, they are more badass?
00,10you forgot the u in armour

Again, tgm.

Well, duh.
00,10depends on the time of it I suppose

Morty: What if you have tgm?
00,10I meen more of will it take place during the euro movie night
Isn't the mare-a-thon next week

So the mareathon is Saturday next week, right?
Sumica: the caanon cannon will sink ships

Fanon vs. canon
Tophat: lol fanon cannon
