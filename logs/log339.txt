Rift's cheaper than TOR or WoW, though, which allows it to survive.

You cannot outshine RD. She is 20% cooler than all of the other ponies.
out of all the mane 6, Fluttershy has the least episodes.

13not even the mention in... winter wrap up was it?
08,01Hazard3: there's another channel where it's okay to post that, but i'm not allowed to advertise it
interesting.. but I'll raise you a fluttergiant.
http://i.imgur.com/TvktE.gif
Winter Wrap up didn't actually present her name; more likely it was just some random other pony :p
sorry my lapop has a bad keyboard. if i mispell anyhing it's the keyboard.
:3
/me Drops book on group, somehow picks it up immediately to same page. Aww yeah.
hate the taste of most but still forcibly eat them because of how derpy likes them too
and t is the wors -_-
Cause Derpy is proof of our existence
fff-
Even when were gone, We still have....DERPY
13but everyone assumed that meant derpy, and we called her derpy anyway
its assumable that it was meant to be derpy, but it was not canon
And I think they said "Deal with it."
Or someone did.
we called her derpy because of her eyes
it would be actually insulting to call her that
08,01giant yellow horse
...I need the link to the image board that first came up wth the name :D
and people hav emisunderstood and said we're making fun of mentally handicapped people
Well, we are...DUH!
Disabled people are HIlarious
should i buy a derpy t-shirt?
I heard that.
13so?
08,01KetaminaDianePie: i don't think it was parents, i think it was bornies
Might be a rumor.
*legal
i would not buy one until the issue has been resolved

11,01Well, I can type %C to get the color previews
13oh.. that he used my color...
11,01*laughs

they need to suck it up and best of all
13i do not :<
Deal With It
hey i signed it :D!
I do not forget all the injustice that has ever been commited against me
DO NOT WANT
I don't think kids would be interested in a background pony
Well, Kids are very observant
....
They would pick out what's really cool to them :D
And Derpy has kinda been a sort of comical character :3
only peoples above 10 like it...
thats a different story.....
why?
Derpy Doo?
rofl
derpy is canon now, why change it?
Reta*********ker
bleh.
Great name, HUH!/
I guess I'm going to sleep everypony
I still contest that if you think "Derpy" is a slur against the mentally disabled, you must conclude that the name "Jackie" is a slam against chronic masturbators.
11,01Ditzy Esmeralda Doo?

Those Chronic Mastabators always get the worse :'(

08,01yahoo went bankrupt?
best part of Yahoo was it's comercial. YahoooOO~
I mean, if you're going to assume that Derpy being clumsy means she's mentally disabled, and that they were mocking them, I guess Rarity's cleanliness and Twilight's orderliness are slams against OCD patients.
OH Snap, SLAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
y'all are still on derpy? =/
and Pinkie's hyperness is a huge offense to people with ADHD all of a sudden.

They probably wont even mention derpy again in the show anyway

09,01Popolocrois was first a manga, then an RPG, then an animu, and then another animu
09,01a manga in the 70's, then rebooted in 1984....so still earlier than Zelda

09,01as I expected
this is creepy
Ignore is a wonderful thing.
^
i set both to ignore
they got past it somehow
Thank Luna for ignore

TfqASMjJtm is another
actually
ignored :)
it's a user
It's infested with annoying people today...
I'm not mad
Just ignore him :)

I am
09,01I need someone to type me an inverted tilde.

oh crap
thank you,now we can stream in peace
Wind-Kind
the show
yeah XD
09,01also
09,01for absolutely NO REASON, enter gluefactory
it wouldnt stop sending me messages
09,01I think that the reason they're inviting and autokicking
09,01is to get hostname information from IRC users
09,01so avoid it at all costs
Why do you even wanna go some where named Gluefactory?
i dont use IRC ^___^
07,01^
z-line
I'm not using IRC
09,01so yeah.
Perhaps it's good I wasn't using an IRC client but a webclient.
I accidentally entered for a sec -_-
Yup, webclient
I just continually ignored it
any IRCops available?
really?
WHY?!
their just closet brony's i bet
some spambots around, huh?
Pay no mind to it and contiue doing good
I don't understand the hate
yep
09,01haters gonna hate
._.
>_>
probably coincidence though.
errr... PM it to me
Whatever you do DO NOT enter gluefactory
maybe i should delete mine too...
hm, why?
guys!
yeah
yeah ota?
why?
that's the HQ of their operations
might have given you something
shiit
