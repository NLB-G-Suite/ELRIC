05,15J_E_Smith71 yes
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE
Well I know I did mine right, as usual
BEEP BOOP BEEP BEEP BOOP
CriticKitten: Ryan was hilariously vague when asked to start giving specifics on the Romney tax plan.
PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE
PLEEEEEEEEEEEEASE
LOL
A ROBOT!!!!!!
DocSane: Now that's a surprise. Biden only won against Palin by sheer virtue of the fact that Palin was a glorified cheerleader who was struggling to keep to her cue cards.

A ROBOT!!!!!!!!
DUN DUN DUUUNNNNN!!!
CriticKitten: Biden is a very deep policy wonk. He knows his stuff backwards and forwards.
DocSane: Well that's namely because Romney and Ryan's plan is super special. You see, it changes regularly based on whatever polls best!
lolol
OMG AAAAAAAAAAAAAH

OH SHIT
CriticKitten: CBS News poll is showing that 51% say Biden won, 38% said Ryan won.
looks like shizuka is streaming
DocSane: I can't stand the guy myself, but it sounds like Biden established his party better than Obama did, that's for sure.
one week won't kill me
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
why was the cap unscrewed to begin with?
:O
So was the reason the survey's were sent as spam was because people messed up and marked it as such?

not 3
Hi Laurayne
'ello Laurayne
thelonepony: fucking
ello Laurayne
discovery
kids...
speaking of November, I shave now, so I can participate in Movember
which is one big excuse to not shave for an entire month
hi Laurayne
Hi, Laurayne! :)
what, don't you get Movember in the states?
Moovember?
no Movember
Movember?
hi Laurayne
my parents are fighting....
/me hugs Laurayne "it'll be ok"
/me hugs Laurayne
hugs Laurayne are you okay
thx god my prents are divorced
/me hugs Laurayne
:(
im okay... it probably doesnt bother me as much as it should anymore... im just tired...
ASoftFluffyThing yeah. On the first day of November, every guy across the country who participates (almost everyone who can) shaves their face clean. They don't shave for the rest of the month. You do it to support some research stuff I don't remember from last year. Most of the guys around my school find it as a good excuse not to shave for an entire month
which is good for me because I shave once a week
dat wall
Canadian_Brony, ohhh
but not shaving causes Meanwhile mustaches
is he here?
im just glad im still liveing with them since im the only one that can stop my dad from going too far... that said, i know my mom is completely at fault...
. . . no
Not shaving makes my face itchy
damn
who?
Meanwhile
/me has facial hair and hates it

PB&J is such a TASTY thing to say
therainbowvortex: every vid i watched i dont know why but the PONY.movs were always on the recommendations
therainbowvortex: I call it Peanut Butter and Jelly. :S
therainbowvortex: so i watched apples,dress and shed and i loled so freking hard but then i found the word brony in one of the comments
AJIsAwesome: wait what ?:O

^^*
Red screen o' death
therainbowvortex: i wondered what the hell was that and when i figured it out i thought it was kinda gay. BUT THE SHED.MOV VID THERE WAS THIS PARTICULAR RECOMENDED VID
it ws cupcakes
Well, this is quite a wild ride. Seems to involve a fair bit of memorization, though
so i googled cupcakes
i read the fanfic
i was like wtf this is awesome
i watched the vid. i fell in love with andre wk's ready to die song
See, I abhor games like this.
then i checked the series and i fall in love with it
I wait twelve years until emulation comes out for it, then I'm like SAVE STATES
cachi01: there is a vid about it with wk's song in it?
'cuz ain't no way I'm going to jump through 9,999 hoops just to qualify to jump through #1000 once.
cachi01: with me i watched the . mov series then was so tempted i watched ep 1 and liked it so then i watced ep 2 and then i was like y do i like this im such a losser :'(
NocturnalBlade: Cupcakes HD

NewSuperBronyU: you can do it
*rainbow dash presents
I had an old computer which had a battery that literally didn't hold any charge at all. It made no difference when I decided to simply remove the battery.
hahaha
Yeah I've seen some like that
that's going to be this one soon
AWWWWH
I've already had to replace the battery once
this reminds me of that underwater level
Because 4 years ago my dad took it away and left it in his closet with the battery still in for months
http://slackiance.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/lazybelieve.jpg
Eh...?
Of course he didn't buy me the new battery
I was banned, and I just sent an appeal.. It can't already gone through..
if NewSuperBronyU beats this level he will get a cookie :3
Vordox why were you banned
That computer more recently had the hard drive die... It was a 2001 model, though, and with how much use it was getting later on, it wasn't a surprise.
^?
^^
Breaking a rule I didn't knew that existed.
what rule
s3 spoilers?

Goodnight Sumica
D'aaawwwww Kiki is best pony :D
Night Sumica
It's too hot here for my cats to sleep under the blankets.
Gold_Demona: where do you live again?
MadSurge: Florida
Gold_Demona: Oooh, sounds awesome!
MadSurge: Not really. It's hot and mucky here like 85% of the year
Actually more like 95%
It only gets kinda cold for like a couple weeks, and that's what passes for winter around here.
Gold_Demona: sounds good to me :D I love heat and hate cold :D
it just started getting cold here a week and a half ago
Heat is nice, but I can do without the mucky
All that humidity...
All the time
Gold_Demona: here it's cold AND mucky on winter :( lots of fog
that sucks
It's not cold here. Lows are in the 60s F.
High are still in the 90s/80s F.
Don't know what that is in C. =/
That said, now it's still warm enough that I can go around with a jacket and a t-shirt
o.o
Which is not that much
32C
Dats hawt.
^
mornin bronies,
Global warming! *shakes fist*
its 39 degrees here
Hello DoctoDoctorWho!
Jmo: Yeah, that's how hot it is here all year.

/me waves madly at Gold_Demona
HI!
Except for maybe like two or three weeks in December/January when it dips down into the 30sF
Ohai DoctoDocroWho

Broken key?
My client does not believe in tab
Gold_Demona: confused face?
Her client doesn't support auto-finish
The client I'm using, tab does nothing.
Simple enough

Lul

Magical_Pablez94: Thats good, I've been on bronystate for several months now
ah almost called it XD
Got to go everypony see yall in the morning aight...............peace
Night Moopy
And on that note, I'm gonna go forage me some breakfast. brb
Ya better pick up that phone, cuz I just CALLED IT!:D
anyways i expected that DoctoDoctorWho. i left BS on may but i joined here on march so i am everything but new XD
k
so any news from here?
Magical_Pablez94: not really, I guess things heat up every once and awhile
like a ban on someone or other new people i should meet?
Oh, well that happens all the time
lots of bans?
/me returns with a bowl of cereal
some
not permanent i hope XD
/me noms abit of Gold_Demona's cereal
woopwoop
I've seen one permaban since my time here
Ish Raisin Bran. :D
on who?
Gold_Demona: Dun dun duuuun!
DoctoDoctorWho a permanent ban, uh? on who?
Magical_Pablez94: some girl who thought she could get away with linking S3 spoilers
hahahaha
ew Raisin Bran
poor little thing....
My master took care of her soon enough
master?
..Don't ask
>.>
too late....
is that sumi wrek or who?
caps neccesary
filly *
filly? But he a dude
yeah i know is just an expression.
Its the least I can do, He was the one who fixed my BS issues
oh well...
You had BS issues?
Gold_Demona: Im pretty sure filly is gender neutral, like kid.
and yes
Pretty sure Filly is female equivalent of colt.
^
DoctoDoctorWho demona is right. foal is genderless.
^
Imma go check
hahahaha that not trusting.... XD
A foal is a baby horse. The females are fillies, and the males are colts.
^
damn you logic, DAMN YOU ALL!
stallion and mares are the relative grown up stadium.
/me mopes cuz he was wrong
but i guess you already know this XD
Eeyup
/me huggles Gold_Demona
:)
:3
/me hugs Magical_Pablez94 back
I think it can still be used on males tho, like when you walk up to a group of girl-friends and say "hey guys"
wat.
The only time I've ever heard a bunch of guys beings called "girls" is if it's by a drill sergeant. :P
indeed, though i approach girls saying "hi girls!"
"ALRIGHT, LADIES! LISTEN UP!!!"

Ive seen it happen a million times b4

11,02I said I was just kidding right after I said the date D:
11,02Any resulting rumors is just silly
Phase, Magicka was a great game to start off with but it's becoming stretched now.
Magical_Pablez94: Hello. How are you doing?
/me cries into Gold_Demona's shoulder
Jmo, i still ike it

/me hugs DoctoDoctorWho
Jmo, stretched with the DLC's?
^
Too much DLC
Stupid DLCs
there is a bit much dlc
Move onto a new game
and they dont add new story modes which is what i really want
It's like SIms having a bajillion expansions. 6_9
good! how yourself, GriffinCherry?
I like Sims, but I ain't gonna buy all that.
Oh god Sims expansions
Magical_Pablez94: Good. Just got out of school... two hours early.
Hey, instead of making Sims expansions, why don't you make a new SIMCITY!!! D:<
Dark souls, prepare to die edition
GriffinCherry not bad. i didn't go to school cause of a strike. XD
Durn EA, for eating up Maxus and making them make nothing but Sims expansions
Yer a muppet Gold_Demona.
Can you withstand one million deaths?
Jmo: You only now figgered that out? :O

Night SB
11,02The issuing of sleep is provided to be of one self to take rest of the necessary cause.
nighty night silly SuperBrony!
I find them just jokes and nothing more, I think that people shouldn't be offended by history and embrace and try to learn from it instead
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: Nighty night night my silly SuperBrony.
Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
"Warning: This episode of Lupin the 3rd The Abridged Series contains humor about Nazis. So if you are offended by Nazis, then please stop watching. BUT if you're like the rest of us, who find Nazis hilarious, then... Enjoy!"
Have a good sleep NewSuperBronyU|Zzz, Ill be waiting 4 you.
DoctoDoctorWho i have a pretty deep respect of life. anyone that makes jokes about someone's death is just not respectful of those lives.
Gold_Demona: :D
Gold_Demona: I can take nazi jokes. They deserve nothing but mocking :D
lol, yup
MadSurge: Come on man, nazi humor is way out of Mein Kampfort zone
So, what's the episode about Gold_Demona? Nazi gold?
MadSurge: To be exact, Hitler's legacy
don't misunderstand me. i can take those jokes, i just get a bit sick of them if i hear 20 or 30 jokes like that in a row.
Ahhhh
I only have like, 12
Magical_Pablez94: Well yeah, agreed
MadSurge: In the actual episode, Lupin and the gang find it, and it's just all of Hitler's childhood doodles. :P
Gold_Demona: yeah, thought so :D
MadSurge: In the abridged series, it's a bunch of really bad anime fanfiction. XD
ok that must be hilarious then XD
Gold_Demona: :D
this isnt Reich, we should Gestappo and jew know it.
Hi everyone engineer here :)
k im done
Hello The_Engineer
lol dem puns
DoctoDoctorWho: :D
Hiyo The_Engineer
The_Engineer: Hey! Need a dispencer here!
Junker I'm TCR Engineer
No can do
The_Engineer: Doh...
TCR?
TCR/True capitalist radio
drawing a blank
Never heard of it
^
Magical_Pablez94: Are you pro Solar Empire or NLR?
Meh
I'll give you link to the wiki o TCR
Neither. I hate polotics
^
.....what is that?
but it died at may 2012
:O
http://truecapitalist.wikia.com/wiki/TCR
DoctoDoctorWho sorry my ignorance.. but it maybe is called differently here in Italy.
DoctoDoctorWho: New Solar Repire is cool
One of the biggest contravorcies(fuck spelling) in the brony community.
Btw TCR is 4chan trolling a guy whose a racist and hates bronies but hes funny :P
I've never liked the "Solar Empire/Lunar Republic" thing
Gold_Demona: now there's a cool version of Spitting Image on italian cable, I can follow politics there :D
JunkerKun: I am fine with the current double ruling, I just want to know the side people would be on if war broke out between the 2
Lol'd
In that case, I vote Cadence
DoctoDoctorWho: My guess is that there will be no war unless BOTH of princesses vanish or die
Flawed.
DoctoDoctorWho: neutral
what the hell are solar empire and lunar republic?
You don't wanna know.
Text wall inbound
I want to
know what you guys
Magical_Pablez94: Meh, nevermind this
are playing
Magical_Pablez94: the hipothetical sides if war broke between the two alicorns
/me is part of the solar empire
nono i mind! i wanna know!
oh.
Magical_Pablez94: Just a silly pseudopolitical thing in our little pony world
Magical_Pabllez94: Pretty much a thing in the fanbase about "What if Celestia and Luna went to war with each other"
......i will just say a little thing then....
i love LUNA!!!!!!
I love both princesses really
Even Cadance is cool
and quite dislike that celestia for banishing her.
Magical_Pablez94: And we all love Molestia, sure
=)
oh well!
If we're putting them in a political light, I vote for Cadence, cuz she's the unloved third party.
you are right JunkerKun ! XD
Crystal Ponies ftw
hahahaha Gold_Demona
Gold_Demona: Meh, Cadence is a neutral side
Whatever they are
Gold_Demona: But that just another reason to vote for her
Gold_Demona totally agree
Gold_Demona: crystal ponies. Apparently a race of ponies going to occure in the third season. :P
Yeah I know
I'm noticing an increasing interest toward Steampunk in the community
The entire contravorcy is based off those who think luna was cheated and deserves the throne(New Lunar Republic) and the loyalists who like celestia being in power(Solar Empire). There is this unlikly rumor that an uprising will soon happen where Luna attempts a coup de etat of the throne and overthrow celestia. LONG LIVE THE SOLAR EMPIRE!!!
But we've yet to see what a "crystal pony" is cuz the season isn't out yet
Steampunk is cool
Gold_Demona: spoilers came out yesterday, now we know!
THIS is a crystal pony
FUN FACT: i have a second OC, which is female who i named Crystal. two days after that i created it, crystal ponies spoiler came out.
Gold_Demona: Maybe it's like the collectables?
lol JunkerKun
GriffinCherry? All transparent and glittery?
Magical_Pablez94: understand now?
Magical_Pablez94 Pssst S3 spoilers or speculation stuff is not discussed i think so be careful
Gold_Demona: Possibly. We'll have to see.
BTW, in Mechromancer DLC there are skills that named after quotes from MLP
Oh yeah, Spoilers not allowed here. Sorry. >.>
Such as "Discord" or "20% cooler"
I shut up now
/me pats Gold_Demona
shame on all of you, spoilers bad.
killerpony7733 i don't think that i actually said something about s3 did i?
killerpony7733, you think?
Gold_Demona: nope, bannable offense
it's not allowed period
Magical_Pablez94 Yeah but the crystal ponies weren't that speculation based on some info?
Magical_Pablez94, actually you did
Instant permaban, no warning
no i didn't.
Gold_Demona: That's why I just said there are new spoilers
And ten years dungeon
hello :)
Only 10? :D
Hello DaringDerpy
Ohai DaringDerpy!
Oops missing a zero
i said crystal ponies came out of the internet after i created an OC named Crystal. no big deal.
100 years dungeon
Gold_Demona: 7 years no trials?
Gold_Demona: And the the emperor comes into your chamber to escape from the enemies
SPOILERS! EVERYBODY DIES IN REACH!
Halo: Reach

Spoiler: Rocks fall. Everypony dies.

SPOILER! IT WAS HIS SLED
Snapes kills Dumbledore
Spoiler: Vader is Luke's Father
spoiler: hi.
SPOILER!(Insert obvious media refrence here)
DoctoDoctorWho: What do you mean, "Wrong?"
I should propose Citizen Kane for movie night
but seriously, no hint, no mention, no words close to season 3
SPOILER! I EAT POTATO CHIPS!
Spoiler: He was dead the whole time!
GriffinCherry: Jun lived
DoctoDoctorWho: What... -.-
and Bronystate is a very tight place when mods are actually active
spoiler: i am a unicorn but i have mechanical wings.
nevermind
Magical_Pablez94: Mechacorn?
kind of XD
Magical_Pablez94: Like corn but with wings? X)
Machacorn? Wouldn't that mean "mechanical horn"?
DoctoDoctorWho: He din't live. He died uhm... where'd he die again...
SO mates. How much longer until the lottery winners are chosen?
hahahaha nope! XD
/me licks AdamTheDuck
GriffinCherry: exactly, he got away
HA HA! I GOT YOU!
:<
DoctoDoctorWho: Wait a sec... Checking it out ATM.
/me is a mechalicorn. :3
Preemptive licks are best type of licks :<
Hiyo TheRandomkid321
Hey
/me noms TheRandomkid321 instead
So does anyone know when the lottery winners are drawn?
Still cant find a decent name 4 my OC
This week?
Saturday
^
for the lottery
Lottery's always on Saturday
^
DoctoDocterWho Mines name is Thought SPeed.
DoctoDoctorWho, ooh, I like names, give me a description
DoctoDoctorWho, may I have a picture?
/me Preemptively licks AdamTheDuck
My OC's name is Whimsy Floof. :D
k, Ill describe him, gimme a min
TheRandomkid321: Does it matter?
yay! OC pictures time!!
Gold_Demona: And I am Isildur, the king of Gondor
JunkerKun: Where was Gondor when the changlings came? D:<
changelings*
Gold_Demona: I dunno. Sleeping perhaps
DoctoDoctorWho, describe?
Gold_Demona: Just like Luna
lol
is there stream?
you don't have a picture?
Phase4: Nope. No stream
Sumica, Ping
/me licks Phase4 :P
Didn't he go to bed?
Phase4 Streams free so no worries
Gold_Demona Yep he did
I thought so
DoctoDoctorWho: Wrong. Nobody survived reach. If Jun had lived, he'd be mentioned somewhere in the afterwords. No-one of the Noble team survived Reach.
He is a large steel grey unicorn stallion, a tad shorter than celestia. He has a dark blue mane and tail with a large informative book as his cutie mark. Im trying to incorporate the word Steel into his name.
brb!!
GriffinCherry: Well, in the end he was fighting Covenants all alone, so I don't think he survived
GriffinCherry: Ah wait
I'm gonna post a pic of my OC. Thought Streaks. http://i1075.photobucket.com/albums/w433/TheRandomkid321/Screenshot2012-09-03at45624PM.png
JunkerKun: That was Six
GriffinCherry: It was number 6
That's pretty cool TheRandomkid321
For a ponycreator pony
Gold_Demona Trust me if I could draw him I WOULD
back~
I got a ref sheet of my OC and all. But i only shared it with a few people and with my boyfriend :P
Yay stream
:O
GriffinCherry: but jun left on the dropship
Phase4! :D
And Phase stream
Gold_Demona Trust me. If I could draw him. I WOULD!
:D
TheRandomkid321: I hear ya. =)
DoctoDoctorWho: What dropship?
I've only managed to draw mine a couple times.
Most of my pictures of my OC are Desktop pony sprites. >.>
http://imgur.com/a/KAaNA
my 2 OC <3
the 2nd is just the version before i met my gf ..:3
an alicorn?
Magical_Pablez94 A alicorn? really
why?
LOL
killerpony7733 CrimsonPhoenix not exactly
Here we go
alright for the color design
but still stick to one race
stupid broken windows terminals
What CrimsonPhoenix said
the unicorn part would be enough
also too tall
and slender
DoctoDoctorWho: I've probably played the game many more times than you, mister! I haven't played it in a while and Jun was not there.
Here's mine. http://fav.me/d49quz1
He made a non alicorn version guys, cooloff
CrimsonPhoenix killerpony7733 i technically am an unicorn, but my gf, which talent is build mechanical stuff, built me mecha wings and so... here i am.
DoctoDoctorWho: He didn't get away with the dropship.
anyone here know apache?
then draw mecha wings
GriffinCherry: we will finish this tomorrow
CrimsonPhoenix i CAN'T DRAW
not many people here are there
I must leave now
>_>
anyone got magicka?
CrimsonPhoenix THOUGH WINGS ARE COVERED IN NORMAL FUR AND FEATHERS.
Magical_Pablez94 Ponycreator has mechanical wings
why caps?
Phase4: Me
NEEDS MORE CAPS
JMO: INDEED"
Phase4: Why?
GOODBYE BRONYSTATE!!!
JunkerKun, might start a game
later DoctoDoctorWho
DoctoDoctorWho: Bye
Bye DoctoDoctorWho :P
Magical_Pablez94, 1 what Gold_Demona said
DoctoDoctorWho: Why tomorrow? Too scared that you might loose an argument?
/me hugs all the ponies
Phase4: Oh. No, sorry, last time we tried to play it my PC crashed three times
ah
CrimsonPhoenix Gold_Demona those are just shitty, and those wings are covered in fur and feathers.
GriffinCherry: and no, I have to leave for class
Phase4: Probably has nothing to do with Magicka, but still
20121012214328 << need to remember this number
Phase4: Hoi. Play minecraft!
Phase4 what is that?
Write it down?
Magical_Pablez94, timestamp
DoctoDoctorWho: Okay.
i've been hacking apache
Magical_Pablez94, 2 unless you have a disability, everyone can make a line, everyone hold a pencil so yes everyone can draw
doing some really bad things with .htaccess files
this is another idea
Gold_Demona: btw very pretty OC
CrimsonPhoenix i can't draw properly.
how good that drawing is depends on how long you keep on drawing
Magical_Pablez94: But... steampunk wings are cool. >.>
CrimsonPhoenix: That's saying too rough
its absolutely terrible and i should be shot for coming up with it
Gold_Demona i just don't like em XD
Gold_Demona: did you draw that?
GriffinCherry: Yup
JunkerKun, too rough?
Gold_Demona Wait wat? i didn't see jack
DoctoDoctorWho: Thanks. :)
Gold_Demona: Nice. :p
CrimsonPhoenix: But you are right, as long as you are able to draw a line, you are drawing
Gold_Demona Mind giving a link to what you drew
killerpony7733: http://fav.me/d49quz1
Ish my poneh
CrimsonPhoenix: Eh, don't remember how to say it in english. Just nevermind me =)
Ah that's pretty well done
Gold_Demona Also yay pegasi! :D
and then virtualbox got all confuse
JunkerKun, I think you missed the part where I said that how good your drawings are depends on how long you keep on drawing
killerpony773
Yesh pegasus. :3
Magical_Pablez94 Hmm?
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh. Sorry then
killerpony7733 sorry , send utton is worst button
Magical_Pablez94 Haha
You know what I think? I think it's high time someone went and made another Pony Creator. One that has dozens of options. And not just copy pastes from the show. And one that contantly gets updated unlike the current one by General Zoi which is abandoned.
CrimsonPhoenix killerpony7733 i still don't understand what people has against alicorn OCs...
Mary-sue
Magical_Pablez94: alicorns are OP
Magical_Pabelz I just... Just dont thik it's right unless it fits into the storyline. Yes I'm a "lore nut" as some say
TheRandomkid321: Well, I can try, but do you really need a Pony Creator made in Game Maker? =)
Gold_Demona I am overpower!
people overblowing thei OC making them OP so they won't have any trouble in their RP mind
also it doesn't fit the MLP world
Gold_Demona: OP?
CrimsonPhoenix i am fair on RP. i hardly ever act impossible losing.
JunkerKun: OverPowered
JunkerKun I guess. But what's Gmae Maker anyway?
Gold_Demona: Oh
/me licks Ponies47
Also some of the relations to luna and celestia.....god no
TheRandomkid321: Meh, just a game creation programm
Alicorns are royalty and that's it.
JunkerKun Any good?
Magical_Pablez94, you're getting desperate to make us approve your OC
klrpwny pls i r son of luna
why?
lol Jmo
TheRandomkid321: Quite good. As long as you learn it's programming language which is quite easy
CrimsonPhoenix i am telling the truth
Jmo Dictionary mate. Look it up.
LOL
Get off the internet.
TheRandomkid321, he intentionally writes like that :P
CrimsonPhoenix i have been roleplaying since i poot hoof in this chat and i've never been OP
put*
Magical_Pablez94 Problem is it's in established lore that alicorns are royal and very powerful and as far as most alicorn OC's go they are somehow magically related to either luna or celestia and....really just no...most you see is uncreative and very very badly done
Roleplaying in this chat?
JunkerKun Okay then. Try it if you want.
yeah no
TheRandomkid321 It called bein funneh
we do not RP here
Gold_Demona Oh you speak german too?
if you continue you will get warned if not banned
killerpony7733 I AM NO ALICORN DAMMIT!
I dont think Alicorns are OP. But it seems like almost everyone makes there OC and alicorn. So it kinda takes the Rare-ness out of seeing one.
Magical_Pablez94 Did i say so?
20121012214328
20121012110819
DAMNIT
killerpony7733 i am a unicorn with mechanical wings
TheRandomkid321: Huh? No. What made you think I know German? O_o
hours are wrong
Phase4: Dat phase language....
killerpony7733 IS FUCKING DIFFERENT
Mega_Milk, is timestamps
Wow calm down
>:I
Perhaps a Pony Creator that allows mane/tail customization would be good.
Gold_Demona You just said Broken Toilet in german mate XD
Magical_Pablez94 Calm down man calm down
Magical_Pablez94, calm down dude
killerpony7733 CrimsonPhoenix i love my Oc.. :I
>.>
TheRandomkid321: Nah. I think the main advantage of Flash is that you use vectors instead of images. In Game maker you can use only images and primitives
Gold_Demona: Lovely OC mate lovely.
TheRandomkid321: ....ooooook
I despise the OC I made
midny!
/me glomps Midnight_Stormwing
Magical_Pablez94 I was not even making such a hint or anything. Just explaining the reason why people dislike fanon alicorns not saying yours is knowing the mechinal wing thing
Magical_Pablez94: Thing is, you can be different without being ridiculous
i like how 24 hour and 12 hour makes no difference
Kandarihu: The best Pony maker to allow that is GIMP X)
Alicorn OCs are just ridiculous
If anyone has artistic talents and won't mind drawing my OC. Never gonna happen though
Magical_Pablez94 Don't assume i was being hostile against you...
Cuz more often than not they're not practical
killerpony7733 looks like Gold_Demona is
Phase4: Isnt there like a number diffrenve? Like there is a 13:00 in 24 hour time right?
24 hour is the same as 12 hour except it doesnt jump back midway
So much hostility in tonight's chat >.>
Dis is gud entertainment.
Gold_Demona: yours is still a pwetty pony :3
Magical_Pablez94: I'm not being hostile at you personally. Just alicorn OCs in general.
Here's something else I dont get. Why do I have red text in phase's chat??? -lol
where did phasepony go
Meanwhile Phase4 is just playing with his codin'
I can't stand 'em
Nuuuu, not Phasepony :<
Gold_Demona i. am. not. an. alicorn.
HAHA
Mega_Milk THERE CAN ONLY BE OOONE!
Magical_Pablez94: You look like one. Close enough
Now im blue :D
Wait no you're good
Gold_Demona: do you follow Bad Pony OCs? :D
MadSurge: Nope
Gold_Demona i were born as unicorn and will ever be. though i have those mecha wings
no lunch time
cya'll later
Mega_Milk You're in the ban scope
Gold_Demona However i respect ones choice. But that does not mean i dislike their choice of OC. Respect person on person level as for RP or the OC part i dislike em
browniestate stahp.
Stahp!
Magical_Pablez94, between you and me I would enjoy it if your pony had actual mecha looking wing rather than flesh-like looking
I don't mind alicorn OCs if they have those mechanicl wings but normally I don't rally like 'em
Gold_Demona: http://badponyocs.tumblr.com/ :D so... tacky!
Jmo butt itz gud topiz
but that's just my opinion
Gais srsly, dis bsns needs to stahp.
nu it isnt klrpwny
MadSurge: No thanks. :I
CrimsonPhoenix not my fault. smelt created it that way. can't do anything against it.
MadSurge: Oh. Mah. Gawd.
NOW LUNCH
CYA LATER
/me is away
Run Alicorn Boi.

MadSurge MAH FAVE WEBSITE AS OF CURRENT!
AdamTheDuck: dis srs bsns
Srs bsns is srs...

Gold_Demona: you are a pwetty pegasus :3
/me throws a dictionary at Jmo :<
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
AdamTheDuck: Wait, where did this vowel-less language come from?
/me is hyped up by all the new spoiler material
stupid incredibly fragmented php librarys
do we have a release date now?
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
:/
Nope. No date. Only month. :<
JunkerKun, http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/035/232/Internet-Don_t_worry_Tron.jpg
AdamTheDuck: O_o
Gold_Demona: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/266d1767200f561020e8d82c9adac03f.png you deserve this Pinkie :3
Lol'd
AdamTheDuck: It's just we have something similar in Russia
Pinkie! =D

Phase4 I got a beta key :3
Gold_Demona: having a good OC? :D
Phase4 Just sitting in my email
MadSurge: Daww :)
She's average. :P
Damn random crashes >:3
Gold_Demona: also http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/3faedd30608bcf586ae0f04efea7a83d.png PREPARE FOR HEART ATTACK
Did somepony ping meh?
Cute pinkie doodles! ^^
/me pings Mega_Milk
Phase4 Well if you want a free beta key to PS2 i can supply you with the one i got from buying alpha squad
Ping!
JunkerKun: Get outa here you! >:3
/me gets out of here
killerpony7733, not sure i'd play
=)
Phase4 Well up to ya
i figured why its broke
and the reason is silly
very silly
Welp, lunch. See you later
Phase4: What's been broken anyway?
MadSurge: See you
JunkerKun, php
All mah bones are broken
if you ever plan on programing, DO NOT start with php
Ze horror.
infact you should aviod it
Phase4: Too late, I've wrote my course work on it
silly person
So anyone who heard of planetside 2 and does not have a beta key?
/me is starting with Visual Basic >.>
Eh
killerpony7733, me
BS should stream Caprica
but I was going to buy Alpha Squad later this weekend anyway
Shame on you AdamTheDuck.
Phase4: What could I do? It was said we're allowed to write our projects only on PHP
how many people have magicka?
AdamTheDuck Ah okay well if you want to do that then i don't blame ya. But i got a key if you really really do want it
Is PS2 even that decent?
JunkerKun, run screaming
Haven't looked into it
Jmo Yeah it's a ton of fun
Only seen Wreko play it now and again.
I have magicka
Phase4: I did that. After I understood that PHP is not my thing. And after I've spent one last day to actually do my project
JunkerKun, for short examples its fine, sometimes, but for anything more complex it becomes edge cases on edge cases
Jmo, it had stealth and sniping. My two favourite fps themes.
Seems like a mixture of multiple FPS games, Tribes/Battlefield
Phase4: Me
http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/ good refference btw
FFFFF
Jmo Plus large scale air and tank battles
orly?
Jmo Yep been in two tank columns the last 2 days where NC steamrolled the enemy
Must had been over 30-40 tanks
allofmywat.
Jmo A server can over 2000 people i believe
have*
Jesus, I'd love to see their server room.
Jmo But yeah it's what you can call battlefield mixed with FPS and a MMO
Froggy!
We found froggy!
Gold_Demona: ...die
Interesting
/me is nomore away "back :3"
Alicorn boi is back! Huzzah~
JunkerKun: .....y u say dat? D:
i r sad nao :C
Gold_Demona: Just don't quote Big The Cat, alright? =)
/me hugs Gold_Demona
no one catches the frog
Jmo i am not alicorn.. ;A;
Don't listen to him, be evil :<
:>
JunkerKun, i feel for you
What Adam said.
Do what you want Gold_Demona.
Yay! :D
klrpwny how big is PS2?
Phase4: Yeah. But hey, we have to do that AGAIN this year. Yay.
D:
Jmo 50 times a BF3 armored kill map
Why the hell the frog was jumping?
I meant client size.
Rofl
O U Klrpwny
Jmo Oh in what way?
/me snipes the frog. "BOOM HEADSHOT"
killerpony7733, I think he means how large is the download.
^
AdamTheDuck about 5 gb's
5 GB? Heh, not bad.
And i didn't ping Jmo
Not bad

Ohai alexxm

Hi everypony
Hello to you too brodashX
brodashX: Hey
AdamTheDuck Assets are probably all that you need rest is server based and built on said assets
Where are the servers located?
hey Magical_Pablez94 and AdamTheDuck is something up with the site cause i go t it with the stream on top of the chat and i have refreshed
Jmo They have two or so eu ones and one or two US ones and then.....probably aus too but from what i understand you got decent ping even outside your country
alexxm, hmm, not sure, mine is set with stream on left and chat on right
Fairo
Armoured Kill DLC made me chuckle :$
BF3 makes me chuckle.
"Biggest map in Battlefield history"
DICE then reveals it's just a massive land of desert.
Derpy! =D

I have
/me dances to Pony Polka~
Jmo: So? What is it?

It's icky

Jmo: Oh... well, then I made a right choise not to play this

Ryan is a fucking idiot.
Jmo: You're right, though. I'm extremely average at TF2.

Balloons and confetti everywhere! XD
JunkerKun: licking is his thing
JunkerKun, nevah!~ :<

Weekend'n'stuff.
oh i know
PINKIE PIE
AdamTheDuck: dont listin to JunkerKun it okay to lick people
\:3/
SO MUCH PINKIE
No medic for the lose.
Do you kill yourself alot via rocket jumping Phase
>_>
therainbowvortex: no it not! You must eat them not lick!
pinkie died.
So guys, need advice. Today's a teacher work day (no students) so I'm not bound by dress code. Should I wear one of my pony tees to work today? :P
JunkerKun: hey i dont tell u what to do and not to do
CriticKitten, do eet! :$
I was the first to die :<
Alllllll the pony shirts!
therainbowvortex: But... but... it is better to eat them... BWAAAAAAAAAAAH
JunkerKun: aww its okay do u want a hug
CriticKitten I would not. For a school anyways
CriticKitten: Yes. Yes, you should.
therainbowvortex: no. I want to eat you >=3
Hell, I wear them to school, event or not.
/me noms therainbowvortex
Sadly, my school is a giant void of bronies.
yay caniblisime wait what
help me
nope.avi
nom nom nom
Team File 2!
=D
o u
I don't think I'm very good at pyro. :P
Hrm, okay. So then it boils down to which one....*ponders*
I don't play anything but Pyro and Engi.
Combat Engi is -very- fun.
Barbetos: Files fighting to get enemy folder?
JunkerKun: spit me out or illd the rainbow vortex boom in your mouth
Just satnd around a corner shooting the flames out untill you need more ammo. People will walk into death.
/me spits therainbowvortex in fear
hi everyone :)
INB4 Gold_Demona murders everyone.
Lil_B: Hey!
god now give me a hug that will steal your soul
Drat, it's so tough to choose. XD
i meen good
Dice roll time!
hey JunkerKun ! :)
/me hugs therainbowvortex
CriticKitten: Which ones do you have?
Wait. What?
I don't have a soul O_o
Ohai Lil_B
/me hugs JunkerKun back and steals his soul
hai thar AdamTheDuck :)
I have never seen a red team win one of deez.
they doing it wrong!
It's theoretically possible.
Kammerjunk: Twilightlicious, one with Doctor Hooves, Elements of Harmony, and....*checks again* Radicalness.
JunkerKun: eww your soul is yuccky you can have it back
therainbowvortex: But... as I said, I don't have soul...
CriticKitten: Tough choice, man. I'd go with Twilightlicious, but I -am- a but of a Twiley fanatic.
Filly Cooly and Dr Adorable are both dirty so no go there. :P
So that may possibly affect my choice.
I would not wear taht shirt. Course I am paranoid that people would assume in the worst way possible, and it would come back to me some how.
Zzzttt
JunkerKun: oh this is your drool all over me then
... it appears Microsoft Explorer isn't responding :/
Yes! Kill that Gold_Demona!
it appears I have burst into flame.
I mean.
/me bits therainbowvortex
ZZzzt
Barbetos: Honestly if this school has to dip so low as to fire me for wearing a pony tee to a work day, I'm happy not to work there any more. :P
Codex do you need something?
zzzzttt
CriticKitten: Oh, you work there?
what?
Haha
no i dont need anything
Correct.
'tis a work day so we're allowed to wear civis.
JunkerKun: plz dont eat me im a ancent pony spiret from hell
Wait, you have work attire?
CriticKitten people have some over active imaginations, all I am saying.
My teachers just kinda wear clothes.
Tend to asssume the worst.
Not Functioning
I do. Our school has a dress code, mostly in a vain attempt to cull gang activity.
Dissconect-
Thank god.
JunkerKun: okay im not from hell but im still an aceint pony gosht
Ah, makes sense.
therainbowvortex: eew... you must be dusty...
GO Gold_Demona!
Well, I wouldn't know, really. Don't think there's a lot of that around here.
AHAHAHA
inb4 the kids use the same colors and look from the school to form said gang.
JunkerKun: i am
Pony gang? I'd be fine with that.
last map for me
And they go on a crazy adventure together solving mysterys! Completely original story idea.
For their initiation, they'd brand cutie marks onto themselves.
therainbowvortex: Ew
I'm off to bed
I just woke up
Goodnight everyone :)
Night AdamTheDuck
AdamTheDuck: good night!
(with permanent marker, obviously)

HERE'S SANJIIIII!
Welp, how are you guys?

Kammerjunk: Well... I had a few bugs. Most of which I found patches to...cause for some reason or another I have to everything manually.
has any got it so that the streams on top of the chat
Kammerjunk: My tf2 wont even download the maps for me. So I install them myself.
I have a good ideas for stream.
Fair 'nuff.
Kammerjunk: So im sure theres a fix for your bugs
It is.......
Kammerjunk: Wait whats happening ar eyou crashing? or what?
Mega_Milk: No, it just looks absolutely terrifying.
Kammerjunk: Like old pony models terrifying? Or horrible game play? -lol
Kammerjunk: Old AJ creeps me right the fuck out.
Well, ain't no stream going, so https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM__V3vAa0w

:D
im happy
Engineer: stop lying DarkStar, you know what you did and why you were permabanned
Dark, Brony, both of you cool it.
I know what I did and I apologized twice and I was only banned for a few days
I come here to get away from arguements, not to see two of my friends fighting over something stupid.
DarkStar: theres trolling then there is just playing with peoples emotions, what you did was horrible and unforgivable
bye guys
:)
If I was permabanned, how would we be haveing this conversation?
/me facepalms
bye Codex
iinitializing...
Evading?
Brony, let it go
DarkStar you on a different network perhaps
if he is, then he will be re-banned
No, im still in the same place
If not, then good
same apartment, same reoom
*room
Hello guys
DarkStar: what you did is unforgivable and that is why you are going to get re banned as soon as a mod wakes up
say it now before the cleansing begin....
Gold_Demona: I shat a brick when I saw the doll shop short D:
One Word.....
Ok, ok
I don't suppose anybody here believes in "forgive and forget"? O_o
Brony, why was he even banned?
Ohai RainRunner!
http://www.armchair.com/defense/bw/crowbar1.jpg tai-kwan-gor-don-crow-bar style
I f***ed with his emotions a lot, and honestly I regret every bit of it
how are things RainRunner\
DarkStar: no you dont
Bronysith what happened
I do
Brony, just let it go
DarkStar: you dont regret a single bit you lieing sack of shit
I aplogized twice
wreking
Check your Youtube inbox
DarkStar: you never apologized, stop lying to save your own skin
One Word...
he will probably be re-banned sith, just let it go for gods sake.
Seriously, your acting like a child.
Come on children, stop bickering
ofna01: i am not letting this go, he didnt play with your emotions so you dont know what it is like
ofna01: you assume it is oh playful trolling but what he did is beyond trolling
bronysith: are you sure hes trolling?
I sense jimmies rustled
ok what the hell did this guy do
its a fight
Techmarine: lets see, he assumed the identity of princess_molestia and fooled EVERYONE into believing he was a girl
Many jimmies rustled
so many
internet fight?
i got into an INET relationship and then a few weeks later he contacted me saying his sister died
oh really?
inturwebz
he fooled everyone into thinking his sister died
:)
when he never even had a sister
reaalllyy?
he was just assuming the role of that
Really reaaly reallly?
and playing with my emotions
then a few weeks later she Somehow contacted me
okay
and thus was his prank
Just let it go
Don't make me throw disney quotes at you, Brony
Yeah
lol
Lol first mistake was having a relationship over the internet.
the relationship is gone
Exactly jmo
its a WAR
But, saying someone died as a joke isn't cool.
At all.
SPACE MARINES chaarge
Someone who didn't exist to begin with even
I know you're hurt Bronysith, but you should take it up with a moderator and not lay down your fire here.
Jmo: there arent any mods up yet
When one gets up.
oh trust me i am
Sooooo, I really don't understand why you would get so upset over this.
im making sure this asshole is banned
ofna01: and you can go straight to hell along with DarkStar then
You're pretty much wasting your proverbial breath by venting and ranting the way you are.
It accomplishes nothing
youll be banned to chat like that
Well, sorry for being honest.
not friendly to anyone
everyone will start a war
Keep it to yourself or you'll get involved.
lol
I'm going to go until Bronysith stops being an ass
he will stop
ofna01: how am i being an ASS?
just shutup
someone ping me when he's banned or gone. either way I don't care.
by nothing
ofna01, go already.
GO Ofna
there will be alot of troubles if you stay here
Jeez all this hostility. =/
Needs to clear out.
Yeah
ofna is afk
the problem is gunna be over soon
ofna was never the issue here
No but he was adding to the problem.

Wasn't going to anyway, but thank. :P
Doxy.
He is a artists
Pretty good one too, just he does a lot of r34
I have no reservations about that stuff, so I am fine with it
I'd rather have r63 than r34
Gold_Demona: what about r63 r34?
Barbeotos http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqjODGmnPS4
Bronysith: That I'd rather have one and not the other
Ahaha
i like r34, some of the art is actually really good and creative
Bronysith weeelllll you might be surprised to know. I have seen some Dusk Shine x Fem Spike.
Bronysith : I agree some of it is really well done
I don't like a lot of raunch tho.
So I'm not into r34
i think my fav pairing is Twiluna
I am going to escape before this convo comes back to me
or twilestia
Cuz almost all of it is nothing but raunch
er yeah i guess i'd be alright with it if it's humanized

I could imagine Cole Phelps hounding some one about best pony
That is what that is from.
I see
Still yet to get that game ;~;
I have two copies of it sadly enough.
Not sure how I got the PC copy
Probably bought it, can't remember.

05i see
lol
not very patient is he?
Syllly came back. :3
there we go
Wrek: Why isn't the webclient working?
05dunno
maybe it experienced an error?
You can not even get to the pony chat website
I had to install IRC, and use a cached version of the site to find the info
Why is that?
Not sure.
I have not bothered to check to see if it is a domain issue or something
More than likely the server that hosts it is just down.
It's saying error 101 for me.
either way, at least this still works

Lil_B you can see new messages coming up?
Last I checked the webclient is wonky.
yes, now I can :)
http://godsowncrunk.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/hobo-stove.jpg
Found this the other day, thought it was cleaver
Wonky is suddenly a aesthetically pleasing word.
Woooonnnkkkeeeee
Okay its gone
Willy Wonka.
lol Barbetos|AtWork
That's pretty cool actually
ok, I guess it's just that the chat is really non-active at the moment
understandable, it's really cold in here atm, slows down typing n' Stuff
PIE FOR ALL
OMGosh! What Flavour!
Not pie flavour.
but... what flavor than?!
Potato flavour.
I think I would actually get a recipe for Potato Cake if I ask my Grandma :/
ok, I already like VLC as my new Music Player, but it needs some more detailed configuration >.<
That is a lot of tanks

thanks
I have returned.
You have been placed in a sho.
Welcome back

The time out sho.

It is similar to a hockey penalty box.
For the purpose of bronystate time out.

Hello
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/9/hDXY4_eePUWBy1jEbnQ-JA2.jpg How I feel as the first sick person at school
Hey
gtg cya
Did you connect with the web client Cranberry_Scotch ?
web client?
The chat box next to the stream
Yes
Huh. Still can't connect to it on my end.
lol
I like how Wrek just does not care. He passed like two TR guys.
cya
It looks like this isn't even on the front lines. Most of the TR guys would be on the borders of enemy territory.
they so silly
Well, sneaking in like this and snatching a lightly defended outpost seems to be a pretty interesting tactic.
As far as the TR defending the territory, they're just doing what seems to be the obvious thing to do.
lol snakes
Er, defending their borders
hey guys for some reason my internet was acting up
Mmm carrots
/me gives Gold_Demona the gift of fire
8D
well everypony i have to go
/me accepts the gift of fire and soon invents the wheel.

Hey Colt_Brovakiin
hello Colt_Brovakiin and MadSurge
how are things MadSurge
Yo guys, I tried downloading a demo and my laptop had a seizure :D it's all fine now though
Hai MadSurge
so is the stream over?
Well I'm not getting anything
ok just checking
how are things Bronysith
Whoa, netsplit?
o.o
why do we always have netsplits
Cause we're cool
:>
brb
Ah NOPE, there IS a stream
and i'm back ^_^
yep
Wrek, we see you again! :D
nice twilight plush Wrek
how are things CriticKitten
damn are things going to be this dead when the movies start
how are things Master-Derps and Dark_Horst
herro all and hi alexxm
just got home, week over, looks good
bye GriffonCherry
Oh look, a floating disconnected player
And you know there is some one constantly shooting at him lol
i assume that won't be in the full game
how are things Dark92Enigma
Whoa, NOW CHAT IS WORKING........i'm back
did you have chat issues as well Dark92Enigma
Whoa. Wrek are you seeing that guy warping all over the place? He showed up for like 3 or 4 frames.
Hey Dark92Enigma!
alexxm: I'm fine, bro.....we're hours away from the second delivery of an event i like to call NOSTALGIAWEEN
sup ryaxnb
not much
alexxm: yes, wait, you did
alexxm: you also had chat issues?
hi MadSurge!
but doug doesn't do the critic any more Dark92Enigma
^
why not?
yeah Dark92Enigma the site wouldn't load the chat so i downloaded a client
alexxm: not unless for special appereances, as he personally mentioned
Dark_Horst: he decided to not do it anymore
yeah but still Dark92Enigma isn't this too soon i heard he wanted to try making some other show
Dark_Horst: because he's now working on new projects he wanted to do for a long time: DEMO REEL
demo reel?
still, he said the NC is not 100% dead
yes but still it's only been what a month
Dark_Horst: It's a show where Doug along with other hosts, reviews both old and new movies
that could get interesting
so it'll have more crossovers?
/me sneaks into the chat and steals all the muffins
how are things sonicandmario85 Revolution08 and shana
/me eats muffins
alexxm: yes there will be, hopefully
the point is, while NC isn't dead, it won't be a weekly show anymore, and DEMO REEL will replace it
AND now......why did i mention NOSTALGIAWEEN?
oh and is sam shepherd here?
/me Dark92Enigma notices i stole all the muffins and ate them
sup zjdtmkhzt
Because since we're in OCTOBER, and we're mostly watching NOSTALGIC movies here on Bronystate, i wanted to name this month as such
i guess thats a no then
um, hello, alexxm^^
Flyboy: we'll have to see.....
anyway, AJIsAwesome approved of the idea, of calling OCTOBER as NOSTALGIAWEEN to honor him, even if there's little to no chance to see a HALLOWEEN movie
Dark92Enigma: yeah he's my freind. he used to hate mlp but when he watched one he said it wasnt that bad. he isnt a proper brony though. i told him to take a look at this website as it isnt completely pony streams
Sup everypony and yo whats up wrek
but hell, we do watch nostalgic movies here
how are things Moopy and diddutz
good
: D managed to display the visualization in VLC Player as Desktop Background, a small Step for Techs, but a big step for me!
Flyboy: oh.....and what does he do/work?
Dark92Enigma pretty much every week something that could be described as nostalgic is shown here
alexxm: fine for me, thanks ^^
Flyboy: he visited the site, when?
Dark92Enigma: he's in sixth form. i met him about 3-4 years ago and we havent talked much so.
Dark92Enigma: well i dont know if he's visited yet but he might at some point
Flyboy: oh.....is he on Youtube?
just asking
dunno
we dont really talk that much so i dont know anything about that.
but he is in a band i think. so i'll have to ask him at some point
and of course, there are MLP DreamScene Videos xD
how are things Boodfire
oh, ok Flyboy
:)
shhh, i'm lurking
alexxm: anyway, have you picked your movies yet?
sup RainbowDash90
im abit pissed thats whats up
yen Dark92Enigma kung fu hustle and the castle of caglistro
alexxm: i did.....i'll PM you, because i don't want to spoil the surprise for everypony else
ohai Bronystate
how are things ekips
nice and easy now that the weekend has finally arrived
hey thar ekips :)
how are things Teh
Lil_B yeah, but that means more work
oh hey alexxm ^_^

ekips damn, 90 mins? the ones I have to do are 15min max
btw remember that Derped Push-ups vid? i got top comment :I lol
at least we are in groups of 2, but if that really helps if we cannot even see each other.
i don't even know how i could drag it out for 90 minutes
ekips it's still much, 90min sounds just a bit too much, I mean you have to exoplain full History+History of the people who made importand breakthroughs and every single lisstle detail to stretch it that long
how are things spud363
I'm not sure about that either yet...but my future me can figure something out
dont blink :3 http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110512190444/villains/images/5/5a/173.jpg

little... how did I put 2 s in a word without any s?
Lil_B brain derp :P
i'm good
single and little sound pretty similar
whats he playing?
maybe you mixed them up Lil_B ;)
Planetside 2
spud363: planetside 2

so if this is just the beta whats the full version going to be like
afk
alexxm hopefully better performance on a bit outdated computers
And even huger then this
dat Castle Crashers.
alexxm: the beta map is just 1/4 of the full map

Alchemist We took samples of Bakteria in the air, let them grow, than took bits of the colonies, mixed them into 5% NaCl-Solution , dryed that, colored it and than took a look at them via Microscopes
Lil_B don't tell me you are becoming a chemist?
or biologist?
ekips Chemisch Technischer Assistent :)
Lil_B: okay, then I know roughly what it is. We have a different term for that in hungarian.
Lil_B may Celestia have mercy on your sould Lil_B
Alchemist but the "Colocium" Part is, when we draw a part of the Bakteria, and let our Teacher have a look at it, and than we have to describe to him why we think that this the Bacteria we think it is
Lil_B: it actually sounds fun imo.
ekips why, the Brony Research and Development Team need more members xD
Well, I think Imma head out for the day.
See y'all Sunday, Bronystate

Rock@element.of.MINE. That is a awesome host mask XD
Love the graphics...just wishes the game had more enviorments...
It does doesnt it?
Brb. :)
thanks
kinda quiet here
Hot topic has sinned.
yeah :/
What did they do? :P
On their website, if you specify your age as 18 or older, they make it impossible to uncheck the "newsletters and promos by email" box
that is just evil.
wow
Woo silence?
Ssshh.
Nu
Embrace the silence.
:>
Yush.
lol
Ideally I wouldnt buy from them because they are where things go to die but the have an awesome rainbow dash figure i must purchase
but they want $35 to ship it which is totally crazy
on what website?
http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/MyLittlePony//My+Little+Pony+Rainbow+Dash+Vinyl+Figure-144781.jsp
meep?
Meep.
one word....
meeep
boop
Meep meep.
oh
is anyone here from the USA planning on ordering the vinyl rainbow dash figure from hottopic anytime soon? I want to buy one but they want $35 to ship it to canada which is nuts.
pony in the middle and walking death on the backgroud :D
Nope.
quite big contrast
so i figured if someone else is ordering one I could pay a more sane amount to reship it to me lol
AJIsShort, did you sleep well?
hey guys
o.o
that figure is at hot topic?
Panda: Yes. :)
what game is this?
I'm not short. :(
Hi, alexxm. :)
It's Planetside 2.
how are things AJIsAwesoem
Pretty good. How about you? :)
kinda more than I'd want to spend on pony stuff but it's pretty cool
i'm good
Hey JDM Works90 you here man?
and i have a chat client now incase the chats acting up again
Yesterday I saw Portal coasters at the mall haha
I still haven't played through portal
It made me angry because I couldn't get the controls
haha
I think I remember throwing the controller at a wall...
lol
Some of the stuff you have to do in that game is not designed to be done in first person with a 360 controller
It seemed fine for me
I generally suck at first person anyway too
but yeah my HDMI cables broken and i'm borrowing someones
so that was probably it
is the chat ded
/me whistles suspiciously and tosses a pie into chat
I have never played portal, so I can't say anything aobout it, but it looks quite difficult
is there a stream
yep twilight_sprinkle
Yep.
ok
th
x
It's easier once you kinda figure it out
Who's on?
Wrek.
Ok!
Co-op was pretty hard though haha
Portal is probably one of those things everyone loves that I'll never get
like Zelda
PIE!
I've never played zelda either haha
oh good, I'm not alone haha
PINKIE!
every time I tell someone that they're like "OMG you're totally missing out go play them nao"
WINKIE!
There's so many games I haven't played
Inkie
which makes me want to play them even less...
exactly
Wow wrek has been playing this for at least 3 hours
As Mama Luigi would say, he's been playing FOR HOURS!
D'aww, Twilight's watching!
27 minutes until class...
I should probably be working on finishing my homework that's due
XD
yeah haha
the professor teaching it has no clue what he's talking about though and is really lenient with everything
So I'm not too worried
ah
He's a math teacher
forced to teach a database class
mama luigi never said that
wow haha
IMO they probably should've just not offered the course since they were so short staffed
but whatever
I want a plushie :(
Rustymeat: I'm talking about the "FOR HOURS" bit.
easy A for me since I know more about SQL than he does :P
hahaha
I havnt watched youtube poop in a while
XD
It didn'y come from YTP.
i watched a bunch of them yesterday
It came from the cartoon.
yeah I know you know what I mean
so many ytps, so little time...

Ive never watched the cartoon proper
LOTSA SPAGJHETTI!

alexxm: They would be better if I didn't have classes to go to.
Wait, you have classes to go to? ._.
alexxm: I wanted to stay and play PS2 with Wrek, but they took over.
AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/f6223ea91a2ad1a426ebe61a5af582e9.png Yeehaw!
Oh, right. It's not 20 minutes to 9 PM in some parts of the world.
Night, Wrek. Take it easy! :)
Kammerjunk: Yeah. . . I do.
MadSurge: Do you have a favorite pony? :)

alexxm: nope
I hope I'm not the only one with a list of who in the Mane 6 I like the most, and descriptions of why.
Twiley is at the top, obviously.

Eenope.
https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=9467
itseems like your page doesn't work BroPony|MEDIC
Hmmm
Bronysith: your pics never seem to show dude
BroPony|MEDIC: if it's spoilers, DESIST NOW.
thats the only link to the video i have, and it MUST BE WATCHED
j
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350053789663.jpg
You really cant call it a spoiler in any way
Bronysith: well that worked :D
besides if you think it is, you dont have to watch it
BroPony|MEDIC: what video?
Bronysith: :D
the one in the link i put on, its a S3 preview
its on EQD
oh, you mean THAT video? BroPony|MEDIC, I would advise you try not to post that
BroPony|MEDIC: thats a spoiler
Bronysith: How?
hold on.......THAT'S A SPOILER
BroPony|MEDIC: have fun getting banned for 24 hours
BroPony|MEDIC: Everything about S3 is a spoiler.
No ones forcing you to watch it, and that honestly makes no sense
but whatever
well, it's been kinda the rule here
for like
ever
i know that
you know that
and you did it anyway
but regardless
yeah i thought anything about season 3 got a banning
That's the rules. Don't break them.
FOREVVVVVVEEEEEEEERRRRRR
jsut makin sure you don't get in trouble for a mistake
i didnt think of it as a spoiler
it still is
Rule #2334 CONCERNING Season 3: Don't post S3 previews, regardless if somepony wants to see it or not, because that's due for an autoban
will thats BS in my book
Not a perma ban. Maybe a time ban, but not permaban.
well this isnt your book BroPony|MEDIC
Bronysith: I know that, your not listening
don't take it with us, take it with the mods, they're the ones that enforeced it
BroPony|MEDIC: *you're
Bronysith Isn't*
Testing.
Dken2021: Your taking it with me
BroPony|MEDIC: *you're
whoses*
AJIsAwesome: I see your testing!
BroPony|MEDIC: if you want to talk about S3, do it via PM
AJIsAwesome Your test is a failure.
BroPony|MEDIC: UBERCHARGE ME DOKTOR!
AJIsAwesome: Your test is successful
nahm jsut warning ya, but I like to drop it now, no need to discuss this more
So how 'bout them apples?
WHO SEND BABIES TO FIGHT ME?
this bacon is burnt, but i like it burnt
YOU'RE KILLING INDEPENDENT GEORGE, ELAINE!
Did anypony else not get a lotto email?
i send babies to fight chimps because it amuses me
Good evening :)
Bronysith: Also, honestly, even though it's obviously correct and stated in the MotD, resorting to correcting spelling or grammar is just weak.
Hai MaxTheBrony
I got lotto e-mail
Kammerjunk: meanwhile isnt here, i have to fill the gap
Stallion_of_War did you check your spam mail? cause it's likely to be in there this time
*isn't

evening Colty
Testing.
hi Colt_Brovakiin
AJIsAwesome: STOP TESTING
.gnitseT
whats he testing
at least i correct my own grammar faults, and not somepony else's
IT'S BECAUSE OF MY KEYBOARD
Dken2021: Ahh, zere it iz
i dont correct grammar on chats
Unless it's 'if it were'. Stay strong on that one.
as long as i know what they are saying
here's a distraction http://youtu.be/UBMJnr04E1U
BroPony|MEDIC: AJIsAwesome is testing, because his chat derps too often
Oh hey, Deepercutt.
I haven't seen that guy for years.
i see
What is goin on?
What isn't?
True.
i know dogs do this, spin in one place thing when they're about to lay down, but is it normal for them to do it for 8 minutes straight
Probably not.
is funny to watch but, im getting nervous
maybe they want to be extra comfortable :3

Out of all the things they could have done with mario... they made it a sitcom? XDD
a la Spongebob.
Partly
:D
pot80: This is better than the animation.
00,10I breaka you heads
The live-action segments are sitcoms, the animated sections are adventure
mama mia!
Are they so lazy they had Mario run off stage?
why is they're mum a man
yes Cranberry_Scotch is right
Oh theres an animation part as well, that makes more sense
00,10same actor

I hate it when the Animation in Animes is so good that it looks almost like they used 3D Models >.<
that's what my driveway look like during semester break

3D is actually used as a cost-cutter
00,10I like this ep
Shizuka and the cars we just saw?
Shizuka: and then you have the Berserk movie, which is like half 3D
Its not hard to defeat spam.

lemme try this again...The More You Know™
hi
13otherwise they don't go into it terribly much that i recall
Ghost in a shell is a good anime
Good day!
:3
00,10hello
most animes are good in their own respective way
Shizuka because Berlin has to be involved in every Word War somehow :)
I only know the movies..I don't think the series would be for me
Heya Sumica :)
yeah I could implant more stuff but im a bit lazy
there just cant be a worldwar without us at least saying hi at the party, it seems
I seen a few ghost in a shell movies
What is this?
Gundam?
ghost in the shell
Oh
Bronysith: eh, I have to disagree with the "most" part.
RAWRity: well yea
yay, war-stories
it's awesome
Bronysith: there's a huge glut of anime that's terrible, pandering garbage riding trends of what's popular.
Dark_Horst can't be a World War without everyone joining :P
RAWRity: then there are the DBZ rip offs
ah yeah
dbz was good not anymorte
Colours off and join!
RAWRity: what did you think of NGE?
more
RAWRity: Yes but if you look then there is an abundence of great anime
Moe and Fanservice shows in anime are akin to Police procedurals and hospital dramas over here.
ah yeah
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350070511444.jpg the face on this Douche bag is priceless
how did they get in there?
There too much blatant fanservice and moe in Anime nowdays for my days
I miss the days of Legends of the Galactic Heroes
AppleDashFan982838: what do you mean ''not anymore''?
with most anime I don't feel like I am the target audience (with I´might be true); they seem to silly and over the top ... I only have a handful of anime I like and bought
00,10ass shot
RAWRity yeah but you get that in every culture, group, fandom, buisiness or whatever
I love moe. I hate overt fanservice.
that has to hurt
13major immediately knows what's up
To me only one saga or two sagas where good
he's bait
Bronysith: I feel that NGE is a show that's better in theory than execution. I like the idea of taking a typically brainless genre and putting a darker, more psychological and cerebral twist, but the execution in the original NGE series was poorly handled and ultimately not as standout and perfect as some people claim it is.
Shizuka: Of course, she's japanese
click=kilometer. didn't know that until today
00,10Rebuild is good NGE is mindfuck
Shizuka: Only the japanese characters are competent in this show
wat we watchin?
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leobr7Z7mO1qchw13o1_500.jpg -- "Relevant - Tara Strong"
I don't mind fanservice when it's in moderation. But it's rare to see it in moderation nowadays.
:p
Silver_Spoon: It's spelled klick.
I never got through NGE , tried too times...don't get what the fuss is about
RAWRity: i liked it, but friggin creepy
+two
Everlasting_Joy: that makes more sense :x
What are we watching guys?
pot80: thus why I simply said I disagree with the "most" part of the previous statement. There's lots of great anime, but that's only a small portion of it that's really "Great"
RAWRity: now what u think of say Gurren Lagann
dat neck shot
I would've watched through NGE to the end if I hadn't been forced to downgrade my cable right before the end.
you can always rent it
sneaky
Guys?
i need to watch Rebuild
AppleDashFan982838, yeah, true. There are other options.
RAWRity oh sorry :P I get mixed up with words an stuff
you can still rent dvd? this is 2012^^
DJMidgetBrony: ghost in the shell
What are we watching?
00,10DJPON3, Ghost in the shell
yes DVDs still exist
i jsut said it
Ah. thx
Bronysith: a fun love letter/homage to the Giant Robot genre. While not particularly world altering or thought provoking, it's great to watch from a technical aspect, and enjoybale as a narrative, even if it's not deep.
RAWRity: so you enjoyed it?
Basically: NGE= great idea, flubbed execution. TTGL=simple idea, superb execution
Bronysith: yes.
:D
red_ony, himself
us, silly
RAWRity: yay. And how about classic Dragon ball? not Dragon ball z
Kandarihu: That's silly
hi red_ony :)
Bronysith: it was great....
red_ony, it's a good way to crystalize his thoughts.
Lil_B: Hi there :)
Shizuka! I like Torchlight 2, and it's not lagging as badly as I feared :D
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350058063426.jpg
damn leech
Queen Kong
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350056082504.png
and it got me into the anime even more Bronysith
13queen kong, aka MOTOKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
00,10yes she cut his hand off
Bronysith: a fun enough action/comedy series that benefits from Nostalgia goggles, but doesn't hold up well to watching it as an adult. Lots of imature humor that doesn't appeal to anyone past the age of 13, some decent action scenes, but ultimately not anywhere near as good as "90's Kids" would have you believe.
oh, man... just watched the colbert report... funny stuff... what i miss?
RAWRity: i agree, still better than DBZ in my opinion
Bronysith: true. better pacing than DBZ. Z suffered from the fact that Toriyama clearly didn't want to continue the series, but was forced into it by his editors.
friggin editors
well, im gonna go now. bye everyone
something that both the manga and comic book industry need to figure out: Good stories END.
AJTheMightyGamer, later
Bronysith: I liked DBZ until the Frieza saga ended
byye AJTheMightyGamer
what is Wrek doing there sniping people?
Yes, it may take years to tell a story, but it has to END eventually.
Bronysith: I was thinking the same thing :).
MadSurge: Did they ever get off namek
*?
I enjoyed DBZ throughout except for the Goku vs Frieza battle.
huh
I liked the Cell Saga
Fl00t4hSh41: Yeah! Incredible, isn't it? :D
00,10love this bit
I kinda liked DBZ but I like the first Dragonballs more where Goku is a Kid
00,10also this version of the song
I kinda did as well
DBZ was supposed to end 4 times before it actually did. thank god we didn't get something terrible after that.
Lil_B: yeah, but it might not hold on to nostalgia goggles :D
Look at "The Sandman" by Neil Gaiman. It went on for 10 years, and ended exactly where it needed to. And it's considered one of the best pieces of western picture, regardless of medium. Now look at most mainstream Super Hero comics. Not much to talk about positive on either Marvel or DC.
Silver_Spoon: thank god Dragonball GT is not canon
RAWRity: Did you ever read Lucifer?
There's some skipping.
this dialog needs more words
yes like wanted 2008
MadSurge: GT? What's that? >_>
Silver_Spoon: Ikr
Fl00t4hSh41: afraid I haven't
MadSurge yeah , it isa kinda derpy, and gokus enthusiasm is just too over the Top :/
RAWRity: I think that's what it was called. It was about what Lucifer did after he closed hell and retired in Sandman
Lil_B: thankfully it's all Toei Animation's fault and Toriyama refused to do anything in it :S
Fl00t4hSh41: it rings a bell. I'm sure a friend of mine's told me to check it out at some point.
11,02o3o
Major = Badass
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU
MadSurge I'm not that good with Anime :/
woooooah
Silver_Spoon: thats an understatement
hey thar NewSuperBronyU :)
/me hugs Bronysith back :D
11,02Hai :3
wow character are smart in this unlibe most cartoon movies i've seen
*characters
Howdy NewSuperBronyU!
Bronysith: let me rephrase that then: Major > Badass
Lil_B: me neither, but I am a random facts nerd :D
/me throws SB into bed
pot80, that's why I like anime.
Off ye go >:l
MadSurge Random Facts! Random Facts everywhere!
Don't think you can sneak outta bed, SB.

Hi Dash
Shizuka, well the tank from that episode wasn't running amok. It was being piloted by a brain that was implanted as if it were a cyberbrain.
13yeaaaaaah but the tank itself was still running amok :3
Shizuka: No, it's driver was directing it. The tank couldn't do anyhting on its own
Shizuka: The combat chopper that goes berserk after its pilot has a stroke is a better example

why now though? worked for the previous EP
Michael Bross is an awesome composer.
00,10last ep was mips not lime V
DaringDerpy: could it be a software firewall on your end?
yay more ghost in the shell :)

so, best gif of the VP Debate last night: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbrbcnxpa81rg2rf7o1_500.gif
VP debates are pointless.
not really
No. Really.
Biden was was a jerk last night
when you're voting, you're voting for the VP as well.
scientists are at a lost
Shouldn't the signal time between satelite and body create lag issues for the tachikomas?
Unless you count that gif as something not pointless then, yes I suppose they have some use for the internet.
meaning that if shit goes down, you'd trust that person to run the country
13SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
SPPPPAAAAACE
scace
spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
/me yawns at the Portal 2 Reference
I want to go to space
00,10you would think that Fl00t4hSh41
well do you like bannanas
The atomic weight of Germanium is 72.64.
Kandarihu: being a jerk was kind of his job last night.
Yo homies whos streaming
Well considering how rarely things tend to go that way, I still feel that it is a safe assessment.
Polymerase I Polypeptide A is a human gene.
?
Sumica: I mean, it would have to be a geostationary orbit to keep the the satelite overhead 24/7, so thats 40.000 kilometers
RAWRity, well I wouldn't want a jerk like that running the country.
Ryan's goal last night was to try and stand toe-to-toe with Biden and show he's good despite the experience gap. Biden's job was to try and make Ryan look inexperienced and not up to snuff.
Whos streaming?
sonicdude558: Sumica
such a good episode
ok
I love it
a lot
00,10and later events make that unlikly Fl00t4hSh41
13RAWRity: and to get back for obama's disaster at the pres debate
stop talking about goverment
the soundtrack for this is good
yes it is
^
Yeah, no politics please.
I love this sries
series
00,10wake up and show the light
?
Shizuka: I like to imagine that before he went out on stage, Biden looked back over his shoulder and said to Obama "That's my secret, Mr. President. I'm always angry."
I love ther storyline in this anime
Sumica: Could be low earth orbit and they just relay the signal. That's what is implied, but that should also create a lot of lag
anyone here watch toonami?
yes
boo 4kids
sometimes
13it's a big effin deal :3
4kids is gone for good
^
thank god
Also, Ryan royally fucked up on the pro-live vs pro-choice debate
yeah
Tachkoma Time :3
13oh good smart bullets
:O
:D
big fan
Sumica, Whoaaa
13when bullets become self aware, we're going to have a problem
00,10wrong ping sonicdude558
/me dances
Tachkomas, one of my favourite Robots :3
WEIRD AL RULES
hey Sumica where do I ping >=-)
dance with me
Shizuka: That would raise whole new ethical issues about shooting people
Shizu: Smart bullets? OH GOD DID WE STEP INTO ULTIMATES 3?!?
Sumica: when you swithed embeds http://i.imgur.com/MvbeN.jpg
00,10no I meen the woooah is set to a driffrent ping
Bullets being self-aware would make little sense after they're fired
awesome Spectrum_Rush
hmm
RAWRity, how did Ryan mess up the pro-Life debate?
make them angry japanese bullets
RAWRity: Ryan royally fucked up most of the debate. The only reason some spin him as "winning" is because Biden was such an asshat in dismantling him.
problem solved
00,10just think you could have a whole clip of bullets that are opposed to viloence
or taliban bullets. those would be explosive ammo
Anyone else here in the firefall beta?
XD
But there's no question who won that debate. :p
13Sumica: or a mag of lazy bullets
Never heard this song before. Weird Al is amazing.
13ehhhh i don't wanna shoot today
So... er wheres the ping :3
Kandarihu: he tried to play both sides of the fence in order to argue his point, and ended up pissing off both sides.
AWESOME PMV
I love thuis
this
I would pick up a clip full of procrastinating bullets.
or are you scared people will abouse it :)
They fire, eventually.
claustrophobic bullets. you wouldnt even get them into the magazine
:D
RAWRity, I saw him arguing that life begins at conception. He didn't tick me off.
have to go now, bye
13agoraphobic bullets
13they wouldn't want to LEAVE the barrel
/me sighs
how about bullets that feared stopping?
Nah, the really cool bullets are the Neophobic bullets
They're afraid of anything they don't already know
Sumica, wheres the ping :3
00,10altho they would suffer from the same issue that smart alterry shells suffer from Shizuka
You don't want to give it out right?
00,10the electronics break from the shock of being fired
hipster bullets. "ugh, shredding organs is SO mainstream"
goldigger
yeah
good song
Sumica: that's why they need to have all their electronics made out of nokia phones
Kandarihu: The problem was that he argued he'd ban abortion except in certain cases, and that we were basically supposed to "trust him" that their platform won't change again. Biden was very clear-cut in his stance: "yes I'm a Catholic, but I don't force my views on others."
Sumica: they'll never die.
Sumica: That's a general problem with hightech weaponry of any kind.
wow exelence
why am i not surprised that raritys a gold digger
weird al is a brony
thats scary
00,10but then they would not explode
THE HORROR!

nooooo G 3 and 3.5 the horror indeedd
hi twilight_sprinkle1 :)
hai thelonepony :3
CriticKitten, he made the threshold of the exception very clear. Rape incest or cases where the health of the mother is in danger.
:3
00,10dafak
wait what
s2?
what anime is this
AppleDashFan982838: ...... DARLING!
Bronysith: TEAM :S
?
lol pause
hi twilight_sprinkle1
I'll be back.
ackward pause.
oi Sumica , i think you forgot a season :D
00,10how did an R2 file get in with r1
XD
hai CCCP :)
00,10lolwoops
what anime is this
Britania is in the US now?
buritania
CriticKitten: which really sort of exemplifies Romney's major difficulties as a candidate. He keeps trying to adjust his policies, and ends up alienating large swathes of his base. Unless he can get a solid voter base underneath him in the next 3 weeks, I don't see him standing a chance in the swing states.
Kandarihu: So he says, and yet it's well known they won't appoint a Supreme Court Justice that thinks that way, as Biden pointed out.
RAWRity: In fairness, he's polling well for now.
badass opening <3
howdy everypony!
I get back to see Code Geass? Nice!
Brutania.
.....
Hi, Michael! :)
is this code gease
RAWRity: The question becomes whether or not it's going to hold.
00,10and then the video bitrate of this opening killed my conection
hoi Michael
AppleDashFan982838: Yep.
f
And how did Biden come to that conclusion?
MICHAEL HOW RU
Hi Michael :)
/me hugs AJIsAwesome twilight_sprinkle1 weegee2062 thelonepony
You seem to trust him well enough to take everything he says at face value.
2nd ep?
this opening is too MLG
/me hugs Michael back :)
weegee2062: good, you?
Everyone, it's party time!
hai AJIsAwesome :)
Do you not want to give out the ping Sumica?
CriticKitten: I suppose it'll come down to how well Romney handles the Town Hall format.
hi AJIsAwesome
great my colds gone
hi Michael
/me hugs thelonepony and CCCP :)
00,10you have to use the right word to triger the ping
/me hugs CCCP
lol
Kandarihu: He probably looked at Romney's advisors (mostly former Bush advocates) and inferred from there, as I did, that Romney is basically the neo-con's newest favorite.
Sumi
/me hugs Michael back
00,10Sumica=yay
2012 is he year of the brony
lol
He'll do what his party tells him, that's why they picked him.
Sumi= WOAH!
lemmie try...!
Sumi
DOn't abuse it.
I will not
Ok.
it works
:)
2012 is one year after 2011
:o
So badass. :D
Sumi
Hacks
CriticKitten, it seems that Romney was the left's favorite during the GOP primaries. The real conservatives wanted Santorum.
da magics
he didnt ask her for the password though
I wanted Santorum
She is so fired
http://i.imgur.com/QK3oC.jpg
nice thing to say to a recovering patient :P
Kandarihu: Romney was the favorite for the neo-cons, though, it's why he got the most favorable press by folks like Rush or Hannity. :p
Best crossover Michael
Kandarihu: and if Santorum had won, it would have given comedians enough material for the rest of the year.
dat pinkie :D
^
^^
just created a minecraft random world.... spawned underwater. in the middle of a very deep and very very wide ocean
i didnt know that could happen
I LOVE this doctor. :D

Sumi
guten tag, emerald
whoa is right
:)
wut, dat anime? O.o
dat swim suit
i'm missin gthe fanservice? gee, thanks limeV
Whatever. Romney says things that contradict labels and you accuse him of flip-flopping. I don't even care IF he's flip-flopping, as long as he doesn't flip-flop anywhere near where Obama is. I trust him not to do that.
,,,what are you watching there anyway?
00,10good thing this highschool student happens to know how to drive a giant mech
dont think ive seen an anime without fanservice
00,10Code geass, Dark_Horst
Well, it can't be THAT hard to drive a multimillion dollar mecha
okay
twilight_sprinkle1: Same here. :D
Her old knightmare is so adorably crap. <3
hmm lemmie test another ping
bleh, that beeping sounded like my alarm clock, blow it up
Sumica
CriticKitten: it's not if the developers were smart enough to give it WASD controls
twilight_sprinkle1: Serial Experiments Lain
goodie
ORANGE BOY!
Notepad time
RAWRity: Cool. What's the synopsis?
00,10sonicdude558, you are starting to anoy with that
ok
Well that was odd. :o Asked for a password after I changed my name to this...
Well, most Knightmare Frames qualify as reals. Reals are always going to be less expensive than the supers that aren't outright priceless.
RAWRity: ok,never heard of it though
/me forgot his actual name. Only knows him as "Orange Boy" or "Orange-Kun".
00,10names reserver pony34947
Lain is a nice anime :)
lawl
There we go, I'll switch my name to this. :Y
AJIsAwesome: cyberpunk series of sorts, that focuses on blurring the line between reality and the virtual or "wired" world. Gets really psychological and purposefully confusing at times.
So... he hands them over thinking that they would agree... after he gave them away.
I'm gonna go over my collection and see how much of it is free of fanservice.
Riiiigghtt.
00,10yeah you were trying to use a name of one of the mods Caramel-Tragar
They MUST be desperate.
RAWRity: Okay. Thanks. :)
Barbetos|AtWork: Seeing how they're losing, I can see why. :D
I didn't realize that. I go by Caramel Scrawl on a forum I was linked from so that'd be why I was going with that name.
All right. I must take off, but I'll be back for movie night <3.
Bye, Everlasting_Joy! :)
Bye Everlasting_Joy

Michael: Nice.
DaringDerpy: wat:D
sooo...there is no stream right now, right?
oh ok
so apparently my PC in pokemon has started dating a TV celebrity. Neat.
red_ony: There is.
:(
red_ony push refresh under stream
00,10and everypony was alicorn but AH
00,10er AJ
AJIsAwesome: it's Diablo from D3
lol
"We are doing maintenance, will be back soon." I did refresh ...:/
red_ony: Try a different theatre.
Sumi
i vote for alicorn rarity making it into the official toyline
00,10try poping out the embed
Take it easy with the pings, sonicdude558.
Lancelot is awesome. But it's not my favorite Knightmare frame.
thats not evan its finally form
I have this maintenance thing too
what is the difference between the theatres?
Wait. this is a gaint blender!
red_ony: did you try reopening your browser or using a different one
I am AJIsAwesome
DaringDerpy: where are you located? having it here too
pot80: Nothing. Regulates chat traffic.
RAWRity: wait wat?
My favorite is from R2.
oh holy shti Cain Marko are streaming their new album!
YES
oh :P
I LOVE THIS PIECE
and then I refreshed the whole site
SO epic.
someone said something to me? I heard the ping
Think Dark_Horst did.
i did
twilight_sprinkle1: I am trying everything right now :)
hey Sumica you know what im thinking?
DaringDerpy: where are you watching from?
red_ony: ok, try a different browser or relaunching it, i think it shoul work
00,10not sure why some are geting the mantance thing
central europe
central europe too. germany to be exact
yes
germany
00,10hmmm
seems limev's server for this part of the net doesnt work right
00,10sounds like an ISP issue
so that's it
vodafone?
telecom
maybe
no isp issue
actually i remember now that limeV doesnt even work in all countries
limeV it is then
it always worked
prolly should work in germany though
Dark_Horst: can you ping 188.122.86.241 ?
Alright. Among the anime titles that I have on my external drive that I've watched, I've counted 17 series with obnoxious fanservice in it, and 22 series which I don't recall ever going too far.
http://i.imgur.com/rGJnX.jpg Maid Ponies!
Kandarihu: Is this one of them?
yay more anime...
yep
not a bad anime
weeping_pegasi82: this isnt just any anime, this is code geass!!
AJIsAwesome, Code Geass isn't on my EHDD
Okay.
shana: i can
these arent the droid youre looking for...
im thinking about getting ninja gaiden sigma, is there any huge differences?
from ninja gaiden
Dark_Horst: well if you can reach 1935 of that then stream should work
http://derpiboo.ru/120732 huh never noticed
well this is frustrating :(
00,10ok gonna take down stream after this ep and see if I can get mips running properly
Kandarihu: so what anime are on the list of fanservice?
Dark_Horst: *port 1935
00,10if that dont work then we go to Veemi so you all in Germany can watch
RAWRity, only one of them, I consider the fanservice detracting from the quality.
brb
Kandarihu: and that one would be?
oh, or was it veemi that didnt work in all countries
shana: what'S the command for that again?
eh, should work in germany either way
Sumica: we meet again david spade
twists
Dark_Horst: depends on what you have 'nmap 188.122.86.241 -p1935' or 'nc -vvvv 188.122.86.241 1935' or good old 'telnet 188.122.86.241 1935'
aprupt ending XD
So is that the second episode?
Yep.
nice animke
