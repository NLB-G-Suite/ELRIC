Medaka is interesting...

But I still want to see a PaSwG sequel.
"Oh that's good. How was the first day on the job?"
Arent there still many famous paintings still missing that the nazis took?

You don't have to experience the Canadian winter.
/me sighs "I just don't see a point...I deserve these..."
If they were Frenchies they would still surrender, even if the Germans were defensless
13you can bundle up for winter...
I prefer cold to hot
XD
You can always put on more clothes
*laughs
13you cannot shed skin to cool off in gravy thickness air
That's not how a Canadian winter works.
Seriously, I feel like shit and I doubt anything'll cheer me up
/me "Deserve?"

What's 60F in Celsius?
13less than that
I know that, I'm just too lazy to do the formula in my head.
13i do not speak crazy metric weather because celsius is too coarse detail for me
well, I believe that look says "HOW DARE YOU"

how could people treat others like this for their beliefs?
sick world
mass media
A whole lot of brainwashing
/me is planning to visit one of these camps to pay his respects
I got disconnected
11,01Sad fact: It could still happen.
for instance austic people would be one of the first to go if i base this off the entire sick idea
11,01Vordox: I know.
Suddenly O'keith just doesnt want to be here anymore. Thats war kid. Its cruel. Its Ugly. Its goddamn shame.
Tell a lie long enough...people start to believe it
Mmmmmm bread.
shitt

I would drag him to the camp and make him look at it.
bc they didn't want to be next
EVERYONE needs to see Schindler's List.

Yup
00,10Sneek a peice?
Thank*
11,01Stalin did his own killing.
I looked in I'm op'd
...
Probably because the channel died and you recreated it.
WW2 was Evil versus evil
Worst thing is, this isn't effecting me...
._.
why are they crying? They just sat there and watched as the nazis MERCILESSLY killed them
I'm hardly off line but it was reg'd

the 'Final Solution'
corruption in the hearts of men
Last part.
11,01Yep.
65.6 million people died in WW2
Total
Napoleaon was either a hero or a monster
End the night I just woke up
Stalin was worse,he killed over 25 MILLLION PEOPLE AT SIBERIAN GULAGS, the only reason it hasn't been really talked about in history is because the last thing we all need as americans is Russia at our throats
Napoleaon was mad
Its different to each person
back
Dem timezones
Night everyone.
when did this happen
/me returns)
11,01There was war before guns.
http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm for information based on several sources.
Total and Military losses
11,01And then we made the bomb bigger.
11,01And bigger.
There are a few such...so called "leaders" commiting similar acts to their own citizens and others today - Assad in Syria is being talked about quite alot lately
And then we dropped it on Japan
and then it shrunk.
and now we dont use it at all we just threaten to
It feels like 50% if not more of the old lobby crowd no longer exist
1.6 was germans.
Sometimes I fear that the Cold War never really ended...
But you wheren't here at the start
