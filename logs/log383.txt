00,10Fluttershy looks like she belongs in readline with that mane
a background pony can have a name, but if their existence serves no direct story purpose, then they're background
Derpy was originally a background bpony , too.

aw man, I should have pointed and laughed at the prudes from here. But the freakout has passed.
Pony should pony pony.
Ponyception.
at least not in a way that another pony doing the same thing couldn't further equally well
but derpy's a hiogher ranked background

I remember when PSP didn't have layers
fun fact. Magenta is NOT a color
Dash: SAI
you should gimme the base and highlight color code thingy
and when PSP meant Paintshop Pro
13fun fact, magenta is the correct term for #FFFF00
well, i'm quite sure magenta is NOT a pinapple
I can't find any sweaters that say that.
13er
13#FF00FF
FFFFFOOO!!!!!!

i mean THINK about it! the amount of energy in a universe is one of THE fundamental facts that make it hold together said univers. if you enter equestria, you take energy with you and raise equestria's amount. YOU COULD MAKE IT EXPLODE!

If I had a million dollars I probably wouldn't be talking to you lot. I don't really want a million dollars.
Saturn, I hope you manage to get some reliable people to help
If i had a million dollars i would take a bath in it and get a bunch of paper cuts in obscene places
i would apply but i am nowhere near manchester and you really wouldnt want me organising anything
A million isn't enough

Uh

really?
no
I didn't update it but its for 41 episodes
11,01I dunno compared to the whole season.
^
At all.
1(15)	02 (28)	The Return of Harmony Part 2
lol
1,3at least 5 internets
well hangon
Derpy needs a side series
hmm maybe
11,01I feel bad for the writer that her first episode was mediocre, but she improved with Hearth's Warming Eve.
11,01No-one's even offered to restream me.
I'm just going to type it out heh. There are a lot of additional info
hey streamers pls pick another streamer
Nittany: I think it's more that Mare-Do-Well took place after several solid eps.
1,3haven't seen you ask either Nittany :p
11,01I didn't ask here.
oh it wasn't that bad really people over react to much
11,01No offense, but I'm not getting much attention today in some places.
11,01Over finances.
well don't
11,01They always get me down.
but i thought you wanted winning
But since it arrived during S2 when expectations were higher, combined with the fact that it preceded several other strong eps, that has led to people making it out to be way worse than it was
*whining
11,01I don't have time for work.
11,01It's all tied up in school.
this was a triumph
11,01I know.
huge success
it's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Honestly, I was less fond of the Rarity eps than of MDW....
11,01There's another problem.
Hello!
They have the same problem as MDW, except arguably worse in some places. >_>
00,10any one else want to play?
21: Winter WrapUp 22: Family Appreciation Day 23: Hearth's Warming Eve 24: Ticket Master 25: May the Best Pet Win
11,01Even if I got one, it would have to pay a lot per hour for it to pay for all of my expenses.
I didn't like Owl's Well That Ends Well
my favorite episodes… hmmm
11,01$12/hour. Only sales jobs are offering that.
I've a being a hatred. I can only name my least favorite episodes.
Doesn't help that Rarity's flaw tends to be portrayed as the exact opposite of her element, which wasn't the intention. >.>
:3 Twilight reading dawwwww
dammit....
*of hatred*
which server?
11,01Which isn't helping.
I am not
11,01Eee.
Wat.
00,10it's just a local hoste
11,01TF2. I might join if you stream.
1,3:3 hehe
I'm all alone with my beard?
1,3lol >.<
11,01I didn't have time this month.
00,10I can try and stream it.
00,1071.53.161.58:27015
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/429765
how long does it take to pick a streamer
11,01I don't have time to work enough to pay my bills.
11,01That's my plan.
It's not the beard on the outside that counts, it's the beard on the inside.
00,10use connect in the console
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU&ob=av3e
I'm even more depressed. I need to stop paying attention to politics
Pft
11,01I would only need $1400 for the month.
/me 11,01wishes WSI would pay me for doing my thesis.
11,01It's based on their work.
ok
For me, it was out of place.
11,01And then paid again.
IVE NEVER SEEN OVER A BARRLE
hey there, everypony
what's streaming at the moment?
do a barrelroll
nuthin
The owl episode dragged for a long time. I don't think anything "happened" in that episode
11,01CriticKitten: *handwave* Computer models.
11,01Nope. Sorry.
portulz
1,3*irked
its all in how you look at things
11,01Persistence forecasting.
you have a choice
11,01That's nowcasting.
/me looks out window
11,01Try forecasting tomorrow.
oooh nyan cat
They don't get tomorrow right, either
Or the next day
Its cold during winter. Proof that Global Warming is a european socialist kenyan lie.
11,01Yeah.
11,0114-days is a crap-shoot.
We can all agree tht the return of harmony was amazing?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-sCrhRPCMg
11,01There are measures of accuracy (skill).
00,10cant seem to get scrncap to see fml now.
11,01We're pretty damn accurate for 24 hours.
Not around here. ._.
Feeling Pinkie Keen would have gone up in rating IF she used her abilities in other episodes. To have her suddenly get these predictions killed the episode. Then to only see them in the Mare Do Well episode.
11,01Just because operational meteorologists are wrong some of the time don't mean they're wrong all of the time.
this is me all the time http://th05.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/121/f/9/depressed_pinkie_pie_by_atomicgreymon-d3f9pv4.png
He also said we'd get 5-7 inches tonight.
11,01Especially when 3 models are telling them 3 different things.
/me looks outside. There's not even one inch.
I loved Feeling Pinkie Keen's moral.

No one else going to share their preferences on episodes?
I dont exactly have a preference.
My kids were planning to skip tomorrow.

11,01Though I'd say they busted on that prediction today as well.
ping me if you need me ok?
00,10need to drop stream badwidth.
hmm, I'd actually say that the first two episodes in the series were the worst.
Probably not.
only Pinkie pie can cheer me up
If we are, then someone screwed up XD
Really? I thought the first two episodes were quite strong actually
11,01http://www.nws.noaa.gov/largemap.php
I didn't "hate"MLP FiM right off the bat when I first heard about it
^
Perhaps not aimed at an older audience, but....well....show is technically aimed primarily at younger audiences, it's just meant to be watchable for older viewers. >_>

I watched it because CR implied that he liked it.
the night i watched my first episode i ended up watching all of season 1
I used to be soooo homophobic O__o
I'm not going to type my story out here.
Then I learned it was Laura Faust.
I pretty much marathon'd the show once I got through the first two.
Then my best friend came out of the closet -_-
Laura Faust? whos that?
To get through all of season one.
lol
I'm like "OH MY WORD ITS POWERPUFF GAL"
Hey, PPG was the Shit back when i was younger!

My ex and I actually wanted to go as Nagamasa and Oichi but THAT wont happen xD
He would give us code that would "benefit us". The problem was that the code didn't work.

Kinda, looks like it fixed itself
11,01*6
Whoa!
00,10but also crashed
11,01Server crashed?
Sengoku Basara is basically a derivative of Dynasty Warriors that "anime'd it up"
DW3 was all about pre-designed awesome weapons you could get. It made you overpowered.
With an EPIC THEME SONG.
abingdon boys school <3
It made the fights much more flashy, the humor more absurd, etc
Power up the bass cannon...
11,01And I was doing well too.
I never did get DW5/DW6. I was moving during that time.
I see how it is
:'(
11,01I would play if I could stream.

heheheheheehe stop it...
Oh noes
00,10ok server should be coming up now.
