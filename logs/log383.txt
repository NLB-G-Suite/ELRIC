08,01RaveBrony: i have 450 words. the essay was due 2 hours ago.
bye Zappy
08,01450 out of 3000
Oh no! D:
00,10I was destroying earlyer this week on wreks server.
08,01so yeah, it's gonna be late
PLay heavy. All you need to do is get a medic and aim in the general direction of the enemy.
"Quick, shoot him while he's monolog-ARGH!"
why you no say bye to Zappy!?!?!
Whats it about again?
and then Mustang killed people
00,10I think every one muted me so i would stop lauging liek a mad man on mic.
EXPLOSION TIME
and Armstrong
heavy is a big pounching bag
08,01oh nice, FMA!
Shit's getting real now
damn… I should have watched that "movie" before a new pony episode aired.
08,01pitty i can't watch it right now
RaveBrony i just PMd you a link you might find interesting
Scout? Hard as hell to hit. Soldier? Destroys your damn everything. Medic? Shoots needles and heals people, and stabs people.
LOL OLD MAN
:o
i case you don't know i like medic~
oh my.
;__:
Heavy is fine when he has support, and getting stuck in close quarters with one is ghastly, but otherwise yeah, heavy is a whoppin big target
Armstrong, poor Armstrong
medic stab people ?
I hate Blutsauger battle medics that know what they're doing.
Scare the hell outt ame.
you will hate me September ~
Pyro? Global warming.
They've got....hungry eyeeeeees~
WHOA
Medics can stab people... Ubersaw? Bonesaw? Duh.
a letter to Celestia ASAP
i love my blutsauger~
oh god EVEN THEN!
...Oh man. THAT GUY
Pyro has come to be known as the F2P terror.
CCan you do this for me?
^^
Hughes. ;-;
Pyro has a small head.
Is this a flashback? I thought Hughes was dead.
Oh.my.gosh.
I take it Pyro is the guy that always burns me to death -_-
yep flashback
HUGHES! SHOW US PICTURES OF YOUR FUTURE DAUGHTER!
Sorry!
the Dear john letter
wait, is this FMA or Brotherhood?
00,10backblasting a rocket is fun as a pyro too.
September: Flashback to the Ishbalan Extermination
brotherhood
Brotherhood
brotherhood
Hughes had an anticlimactic end: Blown up in a Phonebooth.
Spy? Kinda shit.
I never did see the original FMA
September: shot in a phone booth*
That explains why I dont remember this episode
Clearly you don't know how to stealth PinkiePieCopy.
Heavy? STillkinda shit..
Dat Hawkeye.
wow. His speech just got epic.
Sumica: i found hard as hell to airblast rockets D:
Sumica, backblast kills are by far my favorite method of killing
I do..
sexy
LOL.
lol
dat eye catch
There shit because people know to spycheck
full metal... uhhhh
Okay?
SHES BRINGING SEXY BACK
Fuck.
00,10I killed wrek by backblasting a stack of nades at him.
ofc Kimbley would say that
D:<
PinkiePieCopy: real stealth means not being in the location of spycheckers.
Woah!! How do you get cool stuff like the people in this vid have??
dat Kimbley
00,10he then proceeded to curb stomp me for the rest of the match.
Lighted gun, top hat, etc O.o
To truly stealth you do what every good assassin has done since the begninning of time. Take the target from behind!
oh snap
Actually, stealth runs out...
Sumica: you are a great pyro BTW not just w+m1 but a good one
lulz
PinkiePieCopy: Get a cloak and dagger.
And Pyros spycheck everything like hell
I have one
Hey, everypony.
00,10I dont think I am that great at it.
PinkiePieCopy: ok so back to point one, you don't know how to stealth :P
I do
im learning to snipe
The epic questioning of being a soldier.
If you did you wouldn't be complaining.
/me grabs more popcorn.
It's just that i'm playing agains people with about 50 stranges, unusuals, etc
but i cant have friends because i havent actually bought anything yet
BOOM
And 5 years of EXP
mostly
What is this?
Dem horrifying experiments
oh god
FMA
ded
Oh.
hey Wrek what was the name of that "halls of moria" song?
Brotherhppd
DO A DAMN BARREL ROLL
Well that's unpleasant.
oh dear
yh, Marcoh is not happy with this
Oh hai ponies.
steamroller.
hiya AllisZero
games bigger than ~7v7 tend to not be all that fun for me in tf2
Zolf? kickass first name
/me hugs otakon
/me hugs AllisZero
Oh cool FMA
Crowd mentality on larger games make the objective pretty low priority usually
/me tackles AllisZero
though the pony servers are usually pretty good
/me is tackled!
ok, I'm getting lost in the story. Does someone want to summarize?
i hate when there is a haevy at full health just sitting around yelling medic D:
I hate it when anyone at full health yells medic -_-
/me whistles innocently
lol
Sorry scout I'm healing someone who needs it.
Now get out of my face before I take your temperature with this bonesaw.
i like to keep everyone overhealed for as long as i can~
00,10then you will hate me as i bump my E key alot when strafeing >_<
TheGreatAndPowerfulT a heavy is pretty poor without a dedicated healer
Healing a a Heavy as a Medic? You should. THe Heavy will protect you and you both can win one for your team.
likewise sumica
i generally switch from heavy if there are no medics on the team
they are too big of a target
Over 9,00
unfoundbug ditto
a heavy at 300 is not at full health
I can't play heavy.
dude, he has the title of Fuhrer. Why would you expect him to be merciful?
So let me get this straight. He is killing... for fun?
kinda~
Heavy's health cna go up to 350 with Dalhokas Bar
I can play everything else to at least capable degree, but for some reason heavy just doesn't go my way.
And it' infinate, unlike Sandvich.
^
I use the heavy fairly well
does anyone know the ip for wreks server
flutter_spin: The war was perpetuated with a much worse purpose in mind than thar
*that
plus, he's my fave character
I use the Pyro, Scout, and Soldier.
And Engineer.
wrek isnt hosting a server atm
00,10it's not up right now DaringDude
i do love heavy on the slower games, but on a fast game of payload hes basically useless
i know
46.236.85.221
but for future reference
I use whatever the team is missing. Unless it's missing a heavy, because screw that.
Is the blonde one a girl?
Ok, cause I thought he was doing it to defend his country, then I thought maybe it was to find some treasure, then to absorb power..
ty pony
Now it just feels like he was doing it ... to test loyalty? or something
00,10yes Hawkeye is a girl.
I pyro or engie and sometimes demoman if im feeling saucy
She looks like a guy
Hey, how cna you fix a black-screened-TF2?
Mine is
i can't demopan
He was doing it because he and the Homonculus are causing wars on purpose
demo is pretty good once you manage the reload
Riza Hawkeye with her hair down is POMF
Capn_fisty: oh my.
Or do the guys just look like girls?
and turn on auto-reloading
Maria looks more like a guy than Riza
what purpose? ... you find out later on, do ya?
That fisty isnt punching ;)
Hey!! Do hats give power-ups? Or what?
No
RaveBrony: no.
In a world filled with anime girls showing so much skin and having no personalities, Riza is a rare but welcome sight.
They are just useless items
nope unleass they are part of a set
Where do you get them? mods?
Hats are purely to make you look like you have a hat.
No, you buy them..
degreaser set is fun
Oh :o
RaveBrony: you either craft them or find them randomly.
Did you download TF2 yesterday?
Yeah :)
Note that your chances to just find a hat are immensely low.
Eririku
Dat crush
again with the height issue
i want the medic bird mask or whatevers~
she came
/me is a Complete Noob at TF2 :S
Ohmau
dat Sir Alphonse

I'm content to wear Bills hat forever.
Hi Morty!
RaveBrony: everyone is a noob at TF2 at first~
well, I'm getting to bed now, good night and have fun everypony!
dayum

Thats why im asking so many TF2 questions :D
hiya Morty

RaveBrony: you just need to keep playing

Fair enough :P
I just got the thing off of steam, im not sure :o
I've tried TF2, but I get one-shotted before I even notice someone coming my way. Too fast :(
RaveBrony, an idea is to go on a TDM server for a bit, see how the classes interact in a team
CriticKitten: Well, I'm 5'4. So you might beat me.
00,03I hear you all liek Mudkipz
every day i'm bufferin'
Did you download TF2 Beta aswell?
Same flutter_spin :(
Oh I'm pretty sure I beat that, yeah

RaveBrony: Forever Alone.

I demand RaveBrony to send Magical Pyro a FR on steam
adobe illustrator, i'd say
CountDoofus: same name on steam?
are you not able to add anyone ravepony?
He's using PHOTOSHOP.
RaveBrony: what's your steam name?
doesn't look like photoshop - must be a much newer version than mine

I think I still have CS3
Or maybe it's Ponyshop
Yay~

hi everypony
Allo CCCP

ohai CCCP
Hi Meanwhile
Hi CupcakeWarrior
Jaegerpony: somepony*
/me smiles at chat.
hahaha TRUE
05dat quick sketch
/me frowns
Very lovely, Wrek!
I stand corrected
That music is loud
/me turns CCCP's frown upside down.
I'm gonna leave..
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: could you launch TF2 pwetty pwease?
/me mutes
:)
Mission Accomplished.
okie doki loki~
05good music should be played loud
/me frowns and walks away
=C
so much agree
Meanwhile: you have done well here is your reward
/me gives Meanwhile a cookie
I ask not for reward for my good serv-did you say cookie?
Agreed Wreky <3
lol
the following song should played in a residential area, preferably at loud volume
played excision & downlink - existence very loud
"twi is magic, pinkie is laughter, and brother, im loyalty" ...."i'm a force of friendship" "whooo. bonk"
nearly blew out the windows
/me noms his cookie with uncontained glee.
meet the ponies. Make it so
"If you were from where I was from, you'd be hugged to death."
How is Scout loyal
I'd say the whole team is fairly loyal.
scout is usually RD
dat Rainbow Scout
I'm a force of nature, Bonk!
All those projectiles and they never manage to hit their own team mates ^.^
in a world infected with biberoids, good music must be played as loud as possible. it's the only way to fight the infection
Eat Fresh
lost his train of thought
anyone
octavia_pony.
nice
Meanwhile, they pyro is incredible at this
able to blow fire towards freinds with no ill effects, but setting fire to spys
i have no tablet so no art for me
Just got reminded of octotavia *shudder* that thing is damn creepy
Pyro is friendly guy.
the way I see it is this - if I was 14 and somepony said I'll make you rich and famous and adored by girls doing what you enjoy doing... I'd say Hay Yes
I think the Pyro is Japanese, I can sometimes ever understand him over that foriegn accent.
never
Capn_fisty: whatcha talkin bout. Octooctavia is adorable /)^3^(\
Dat Fluttershy.
ha ha im not 14

Oh my glob.

QUICKLY WHAT MADE YOU GUYS BRONIES
YOUTUBE
4 chan
what is /mlp/?
00,10CountDoofus2 it gets teh job done.
Night of Pony, courtesy of an escapist post.
Curiosity
Lmao I just read a newspaper article that a legally declared insane has painted 6 of his horses in resemblence of the Mane 6.
and youtube
Youtube did
My friend in Albany.
00,10Youtube+eps
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=O_Q6M6pO_2s
Hell yeaaah, Youtube.
September: insane people can own horses?
bronies.memebase, saw it, was funny, watched season 1 without sleeping
This video did it for
me
-/mlp is 4chan giving up against the pony
watched every week since
actually a magizene got me interested in bronies
cause I've been trying to trade a crate with TheGreatAndPowerfulT for fifteen minutes, no dice no way
September: I can beat that. I read an article discussing a rare genetic disorder that turns a person's skin blue.
i saw it on tv one day wondered what it was saw it was MLP and i thought: wow an MLP i like? YouTube here i come.
Give in to the herd. Resistance is futile.
yep
Meanwhile he was claimed insane after someone saw he was painting a horse in rainbow colors
And one of the people who had this disease was a women who lived into her late 80s. Her name was Luna.
bad luck D: steam hates me it seems
September: in many ways that's exactly how it should work.
Meanwhile, there really is no escape from the hers, I know I tried and failed miserably
I am really looking forward to Serenity tomorrow, best film ever. (Yes i'm a browncoat)
herd
I first heard about bronies and thought it was a joke
lol flutterpunk
When I saw that, it took everything I had not to burst out laughing at it
WHATs evryponies favorite 8 or 16 bit Game
Super Mario Bros.
^
Be specific
which one
8 bit: Terraria
No actually pokemon silver
the very first one
I'm too busy watching ponies to play video games.
damn...
Either that or Adventure Island
Pokemon Gold.
i saw pony memes and wanted to know where they came from so i downloaded S1 around last september/october
hmmmmmm...... Super mario World or Supeer mario bros 3 or Super Metroid
Mine's probably SMB or Pokemon.
16 bit: Donkey Kong Country SNES
8-bit, Super Mario Bros. EWJ for 16-bit
Seriously, has anyone heard of Adventure Island for NES?
oh and any classic pokemon game
CCCP: super mario bros 3!
fluttershy looks great with a mohawk
You guys are cool
and never heard of it
mario_pony: :D amazing game
Sorry for the link, but this song is just too epic. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdMRO2IvLYI
Metalshy
soo many mario games to choose from!
Dashie_Dashie: your sorry is irrelevant, no non image links.
seen firewind live :D
Listen to the song and then tell me that
;)
definatly not hotel mario
meanwhile, while meanwhile trolls the rules
Dashie_Dashie: song is also irrelevant.
Exact Plot to all current mario games: Stomp shit, Collect Shit, Fight Turtle, No secks with princess. Credits w/ flacidity.
does it count if you just paste after the /watch ?
CCCP: *shivers*
avast fluttershy's ass would fit as a perfect song for this drawing. :)

Night KwakLad
Gnight
dang my browser just crashed
Are some bronies really attracted to ponies?
night man
Some are
night night KwakLad
Gnight KwakLad
Some.
MASF123: if something exists, someone somwhere is attracted to it.
There willl be creeps in evry fandom
Well, you have to admit, the ponies are appealing.
MASF123: i think thats a myth
Yeah that R34
Eeyup.
If it exist s its a fetish no exeptions
NO FUCK R34!!!
No r34 chat
see the rules of the internet
Indeed.
depends on the picture but the normal look of them from the series, no.
Irts not rule 34
its rule 187
CCCP: thats a little excessive...
we need to stop that rule!!!!!
i think
/me embraces this freaky fandom.
187?
I'd love to show Rainbow Dash my rock music play list.
Whats that.
she would be pleased.
Which rule is 34? Humanized?
Porn of it
Can we NOT talk about that.
OH.
You can't stop Rule 34 without impeeding freedom of creativity.
I went to The Brony Network and found the chatters posting links of seductive pony pics and they were clopping to it
Rule 34: if it exists, there is porn of it, no exceptions.
well, i like slugbox's less ..erm, exposed pony stuff
Rule 87 if it exists there is ponies of it
emangamer: i understand that there are creeps out there but what if a little girls looked up MLP on imagaes?
R34 can suck it e_e
People will draw what they want and the best you can do is to get over it.
the actual Rule
no talky rules
EVERYPONY STOP!!!!
Um...can we NOT talk about R34.
It suckss.
Seriously.
MASF123: that's disturbing.
Calm down everypony.
Yeah lets stop 34'ing
no talking about it!!!!!
happy thoughts ^^
Listen to meanwhile
Which rule is the humanized ponies?
I was just stating what the actual rule was for the misinformed.
/me stretches
I need to find this forum. This place is too stiff and huffy.
drop the 34 nonsense, please.
Ok, ok you silly fillies, lets calm the Rule ___ Stuff.

@wrek gimme the link to this song
Yfw no one has used this room in like a day.

DashingRainbow: I'm a bit late, but oh well.
Awesome song.

Crazy TRAIN!

Oh, I;m too sexy for my shirt
limited airtime/speaking part
That's much better.
Wrek that is an amazing mane <3
00,10I need to stream some readline again.
orf orf orf orf clap ord clap ord clap atatatatattaattatat daawaawawwaw
For the time being, Fluttermohawk is best mohawk.
Amazing ponehh.
Meanwhile: Oh, well. I wasn't planning on sleeping any time soon anyway.
fluttershy needs to switch to having a mohawk
MirrorImage: well vinyl scratch has been given a name by the hub.
nah i got to sleep soon
after WE gave it to her first
that mane is wow words cant describ its beauty<3
gnight guyz
I was honestly expecting HEYEAHAYAH when I first herd that drum/snare
Oh it is this song lol
never said Vinyl wasn't a background pony
just 2 more hours until I can sleep.
she's an ascended extra
I swear I heard this song before...
Well VS is DJ Pon3 on stage, right
Yes
Vinyl Scratch is DJ PON-3
essentially
They're the same, yeah
Brb for a bit
00,10Fluttershy looks like she belongs in readline with that mane
Yes got renamed by the fans and it became her offical DJ name
a background pony can have a name, but if their existence serves no direct story purpose, then they're background
Derpy was originally a background bpony , too.
Vinyl is DJ P0N-3 when she DJ's basically...
*pony
ditzy doo used to be derpys name
derpy is a background pony
aw man, I should have pointed and laughed at the prudes from here. But the freakout has passed.
Pony should pony pony.
Ponyception.
at least not in a way that another pony doing the same thing couldn't further equally well
so whats wrek drawing?
Forever prudish.
we need epic dance off episode
but derpy's a hiogher ranked background
looks like fluttershy with purple hair
Derpy is the mascot of Bronydom.

I personally see pink.
someone needs their spectral perception slapped right
HI everypony
OHAI
My beard laughs at your weak constitutions.
This song makes me think of Biker Mice from Mars.
Hi operatorpony.
Color Blindness
hi DashingRainbow
highlights are pink
RainbowDashisbestpon: you better think before you mess with the pink...
<-- color deficient yet allowed to join marine corps
this is pink. pink is not defined by softness
05lookign at the percentages of the colour wheel that pink is more red than blue
As does my moustache.
Hi CCCP

Sumica could be worse, could be set up, but too late to use it
Aren't layers amaing?
/me is now shaving is head so that people look at his beard more.
idc but i want my punk rock sims 3 daughter to have that color/highlights
Erryday i'm layerin.
lol
youre really good at this
Why not stick a sign to your face that says "LOOK AT MY FACIAL HAIR"
What program is Wrek using?
Lag....
do a barrle roll
I remember when PSP didn't have layers
fun fact. Magenta is NOT a color
Dash: SAI
Ah, mmk.
Lol @Meanwhile
Magenta's not a color? Dafuq?
you should gimme the base and highlight color code thingy
and when PSP meant Paintshop Pro
00,10it's easly fixed unfoundbug, I set it up. then I stream redline after wrek is done.
13fun fact, magenta is the correct term for #FFFF00
well, i'm quite sure magenta is NOT a pinapple
I can't find any sweaters that say that.
13er
13#FF00FF
DashingRainbow: there is not color on the spectrum between red and purple
Must have been hell.
FFFFFOOO!!!!!!
therefor it is not a REAL color
That is weeeeeeird.
Who would win in a fight Fluttershy or Twilight?
Magenta, the word for fuchsia when you can't spell fuchsia.
sounds like a not-swear word
funfact I love Shizuka
Maybe if I braid my beard- wait, I won't do that.
DashingRainbow:
00,10everyone loves Shizuka
http://www.biotele.com/magenta.html
Irrelevant.
00,10but must be willing to face the wrath of Vivi
Too lazy to click links atm.
Meanwhile: magenta is not in the color spectrum
Lol
I think I like Reading Rainbow because of RD
Sumica: truer words have never been spoken
emangamer: tell somepony who cares.
dede dumdum dede dumdumdedumdum
Yes MASF xD
I REALLY LIKE HER MANE.
Meanwhile: I cares...
emangamer: forever alone.
well im free for the next 15 min
C'mon, Meanwhile..
^
Let's be nice here :{
13emangamer: magenta can't be made by a single wavelength no, but it is a distinct color
bastards kicked me outta the bg cuz i was wasnt playing n on stream instead
Reading is now 20% cooler.
now now, let's stay nice
13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magenta
Shizuka: http://www.biotele.com/magenta.html thats what I read...
and I heard it somewhere else too
Meanwhile, Meanwhile gets pinged twice
I can't be nice all the time. It's hard enough trying to do it as long as I'm in here.
13for instance i think the technical term for the color i'm using is also magenta, though putty puts it closer to pink
:\
Just try :{
Fact is I'm not a nice person.
oh green, you anomaly, you
00,10what are you an art dictonary?
oooh green dot
you guys should read this
Sweetie Belle? Where?
Green be my favorite color.
heh, anyone else think of the telnet application when Shizuka mentioned putty?
gotta go right now
so not pink and not purple
00,03Wow... I've learned something today! ^_^
Purple is best colour.
her hairs magenta/fuschia
Wheeew.
13that.... would be exactly it unfoundbug....
MASF123: wow. had to think to get that one
hmmm
Blue is best colour.
print screen it
BLACK is best
Lol. CountDoofus what a name
LOL
absolute nothing
RED is best color!!!!!!
sample the colour in paint programme
CountDoofus, as soon as you said that, I got it too.
check hexadecimal code
white is best cuz its EVERY color
Blue is best olor.
Pinkie Pie is best pony and blue is best colour.
*color
red
Dash is blue
Meanwhile, no.
Oh god damn it's 2am, completely lost track of time. Bye everyone!
Shizuka: did you know, the more you fear spiders, the larger they appear to be?
RD is best pony.
Rainbow Dash is best pony, rainbow is best color.
/me rolls out of chat
lol gumri
SonicRainboom: your opinion is WRONG.
why do we have to name things such as colours, cant re just refer to them in hex codes
bye Gumri
Bye Gumri.
no ambiguity then
night/morning Gumri
00,10Armour is best armor
Bye Gumri
DashingRainbow is best pony
No.
<3
DashingRainbow: I agree strongly
Yours are :D
Yessss
Anyway.

13i'm the one up til 4 in the morning...
I went with colors. xD
00,10like I am not?
7:09am
It's easier to cheat if you cheat creatively.
only cos non creative people can't think up decent excuses/stories
EEexactly.
Lyra = sumica colors, bon bon = somewhat Shizuka colors
Nice. Bronies were mentioned in the newest Rifftrax.
3:09 am here -.-
13so really neither of us are asking why we're up making chocolate pudding
13we just are
holy shit.... the PINK IS A LIE!:O
...Anyone heard of Equestria Online?
yay choc pud
I won't ask if you share
Heard of it DashingRainbow. Only keep up to date with it's rare EQD postings.
pinkie pie is hot pink
Yeahh...
Shuzuka is a very pretty pony. :$
Pinkie Pie is best pink.
00,03pfft, I lost control of my life at 3 in the morning once~
And also, they dont post a lot of updates e_e
Maybe I'd were a light pink tie.
136am is when i realize i have lost control
pinkamena... *covers face from potential punchs*
what if.... we onnly THINK we see pinkie pie?
its harder to read the text that has color overlay its easier to read the one thats just colored text itself
Confound these ponies, they drive me to make pudding at 4 in the morning.
Pinkamena is fuck yes.
4 AM Shizuka
pudding!
Shizuka: "What your eye actually sees as pink is a combination of red and blue light, or, to put it another way, the full light spectrum with the green light removed."
Pinkamena is best fanfic pony.
I once lost control of my life at midnight. I went outside and walked for 3 hours. I woke up on a bench in another village.
Hey, Wrek?
13yes emangamer, but that doesn't mean it's not a color .-.
4am is where i decide to stay up because i will not get out of bet in time for anything in the morning
my minecraft skin is pinkamena lol. i go back n forth from shadowbolt
%Shizuka is a very pretty pony in that picture. :$
or gir
bed*
this picture is fantasticly amazing and 20% cooler
Dat hair.
00,10I think my colors are a bit more great and powerfull then lyra's
Wrek, if you can read this, can you draw Pinkamena sometime?
13also i try to never be still awake past 6am... hazarding a system crash being up that long...
Brony4Life: More like 120% cooler!
wrek are you drawing a random pony or is just fluttershy with different hair
yeah
Jiff he's drawing Flutttershy...
I don't see what's wrong with the hair o.e
I wouldn't say that hair is different.
LOL! Look what I found: http://derpy.me/tu1V9
jffry890: my Minecraft skin is the Nyan cat
No qualms with the hair so far.
The reason it may look purple-ish is because Wrek is making it look like shading.
I like it. o.e
lol CountDoofus.
CountDoofus: thats pretty great
my mc skin is flutterborn
i love the hair but i was just wondering what he was drawing
why am i am watching this if its not saturday
btw im still waiting for the hex codes for base/highlights
is this pic the whole body of Fluttershy or just her head?
My MC skin would be Rainbow Dash. But I don't have MC. >.<
I bet that hair effect would make great tendons.
i once lost controll of my life. i was drunk like fuck, took the train home somewhat halfway sober at 8 am the next morning, missed my stop 3 times and slept on a train station bank. and appearently someone had puked onto my fabulous hair.
dat autotune
dont have minecraft O.o
i now know what a hobo feels like
BLASHPHEMY
NOT good
*headbangs*
Guys, should I get MC? Is it worth the money?
pleeease tell me what song this is
Hobo's don't feel good. Who'da thought.
only if you like creative sandbox games
rainbow.
Duh.
DashingRainbow: yes its more than worth the money
Dunno any Sandbox games
Awesome
ah, found it

I may buy it for my birthday.
G-mod = sandbox game.
MC... Minecraft?
05so uh
05thoughts?
Wrek, that's awesome.
gmod is awesome
Wub it Wrek
if you dont like playing creative sandbox (essentially 8-bit legos) then you shouldnt get it
pretty~
I fell in love with it <3
Is mayonaise an instrument?
nop
MC is mostly describes as "digital lego"
Wrek: doing good. Keep up the good work!
Wrek, can you draw Pinkamena sometime?
It's a picture, @Wrek
Wrek's already done pinkamena
:3

05MASF123, stop goign on my nerves
horse radish isnt an instrument either
As for the picture, thoughts are immense :D

I used to be addicted to minecraft but it lost its charm
LOve this song
TELL ME SONG

Why does this remind me of digimon
Ah...this song brings back memories.
I just realized the dots for the countdown for the Friday Stream are the colors of the Mane6.

daringdude - its on the digimon movie
OMG LOL
I have a new favorite youtube channel now ^_^
YES
Zecora is best demopony.

@Wrek: I think its perfect
we're all black.

00,10You are geting good with that new program wrek.

I'm English.

#FFB6C1 is lightpink

/me remembers when he learned that everyone one this one Yugioh Forum was black.
oh dear god
please dont link it
Sumica, link me to molestia
wow I learned this. A million dollars is a ton of money.
it was cool as hell.
I thought everyone knew this song
BIG BANG THEORY SONG
YES
i prefer pleasant pony dreams
really

wrek, to me there is something odd with the eye, placement maybe cant really put my finger on it
00,10same guy as the one I just linked.
BIG BANG THEORY THEME!

lol big bang theory
no, a million dollars ACTUALLY weighs ton

YESH!
What a great tme to come back :D
IM SINGING ALONG
Never watched Big Bang theory.
Sheldon is best BBT character.
sorry caps
mfw the chat lives in the fututure
Actually, as shown in Hearth's Warming Eve, Equestria is their country, not the name of the pony world..
Also, dat Fluttershy
ME TOO BRONY4LIFE XD
If I had a million dollars..
yeah, then eye kinda could be shoved a bit to the left
We wouldn't have to eat Kraft dinner
Otherwise, they wouldn't have founded Equestria.
I don't understand how everyone in the brony community are all like super fancy artists
^
Favorite BigBangTheory char is Sheldon <3
Only the ones who showcase it.
but we would still eat Kraft dinner - we'd just eat more
apparently, the woman that voices Zecora is called Brenda Chrichlow
google away
Lol
Chrichlow
Well i'm off
DashingRainbow: agreed
00,10and he has expanded the scout skin to include scootaloo Derpy and one of the G1's

What is so good about The BigBang Theory?
Bye Paradise92
05<lemur> I don't understand how everyone in the brony community are all like super fancy artists
no idea - never watched it
05>implying im super fancy
i'm guessing it's something about the ponies. they kinda seem to hold a strong attraction for creative people
well im out gotta be up at 4
or wanted to
05>mfw
RAWRity loves Big Bang Theory
Wrek: you are super fancy.
yOU ARE!
wrek, you are
i dont know how i would feel though shooting to kill a fluttershy in TF2
1,3Wrek is super-fanciest
keep up the good work wrek :D
Ponies have virtual MSG?
lol wrek you are a super fancy artist
Got a question for you TF2 fans. What's the whole thing with Rainbows making Scout cry?
00,10yeah wrek is leuberfancy.
DashingRainbow: i think its a line from the spy
DashingRainbow: when the spy dominates a scout he has a chance of saying "May I borrow your earpiece, this is scout, rainbows make cry! over."
Ohh.
Wrek this is the best Fluttershy ill EVER see
1,3so I've been wondering Wrek, what type of tablet do you use?
I need to find some way to put back into the brony community
xD Ohh
/me looks at Brenda Crichlow's imdb
Dashing: it's something the Spy says in a manner of a taunt. "May I borrow your earpiece? *changes voice* This is Scout! Rainbows make me cry! Over!"
Brony4Life: until the scientists finish that portal to Equestria and you see Fluttershy for real.
xD
Growing a moustache would be invaluable to the community
Time for me to go byebyes.

i cried my eyes out at My Little Dashie

So he makes robot buddies for himself, and they make fun of them.
finnaly the white spot is gone that was making me go haywire
the movies, and eachother, that is.

Been re-reading Bakuman this past week. Mashiro and Azuki need to stop making me want to punch them in their faces.
I KNEW IT WAS UNREAL SUPERHERO
slips into unconciousness
what I miss?
Seriously, this love story is one of the dumbest things I've ever read.
@wrek: you should do a picture of all the main ponies
Oh what a magical place

"I like you!" "I like you!" "Let's not see eachother at all for 10 years until I've become a succesful Mangaka and you're a super famous voice actress, then we can get married!" "Surely this is a plan for true love!" ugh.
d'aww, bird <3
too much Spike vision :P
I will admit the hair is very nice.
Sounds way smarter than Twilight.
^
so they went from Death Note to Bakuman.
00,10can it be TF timez now?
Tovler: you know, as shitty as Twilight is, it at least had SOME grounding in some semblance of reality.
05at 4am?
lol
1,3lol
@Wrek: oooh do avast fluttershys ass extended
ooh tf2
Just show us the new mlp maps :P
Wrek: could you share this playlist to Michael Cox?
4AM... not for me then :p
YES AT 4am.
Tovler: I personally think Bakuman's better than Death Note.
Derpy pic
i like the sound of that bass
00,10exactly wrek
Song sounds epic.
00,10I played it at 4 am =p
and whadoyaknow
someone micspam this onto the server
it is epic
Tovler: i thought you were talking about twilight sparkle
Sumica, then you made pudding because you lost control of your life?
micspam?
That's like going from Full Metal Alchemist to a manga about learning how to farm in college.
why would you need to mic spam it, just leave stream on
dat metal cover
so everyone can hear the awesome
Tovler: eh, not really. Bakuman's very mundane in it's setting, but the characters are a lot more enjoyable.
dat Myke - So Many Wonders is awesome
Wrek: do you have that song from epic cupcake time?
Or going from Elfen Lied to a manga a women's skiing long jump.
you know those "... For Dummies" books... does one exist for drawing?
/me plops in.
(gotta start somewhere)
And Im sure there is CountDoofus.
Tovler: taht'd be a big improvement, since Elfen Lied kinda blows whale chunks.
no tf2 Sumica?
Brohoof /)(\

Or going from Bleach to a manga about diving for exotic fish in Hawaii.
Brohoof you say?
RAWR

wut?
uh....
Dafuq?
Tovler: again, would probably be more interesting than what Bleach has been doing the past 3 years.
/me is terrified
Gotta go, be back soon

Or going from Naruto to manga about baseball. I do remember reading Bakuman, and it wasn't for me.

LOZ music
d'aww
dat derpinkie
Tovler: I disagree. I feel that gore and the like are done "right" when it's used to enhance the atmosphere of the story (see: Berserk). With Elfen Lied it was more that they just want blood and tits on the page in order to tittilate the viewer.
Derp.

best one = Rainbow Dash
While Bakuman deffinitely has it's flaws (See: Iwase's entire character, Mashiro and Azuki's romance) I feel that it's better than Death note in 2 respects. 1, there's a more diverse and likeable cast, where as Death Note basically just had L and Light carrying the story while the rest of the cast was rather useless. 2, the motivation of the characters is more relateable and endearing.

Dat text

and the one bfore?

you should show the skyrim mod that replaces dragons with fluttershy
O.O
LOL
whut!
Could someone explain what the hell this is?
and then heavy died of diabeetus
:O
ya fun mod
Death Note had the rather ambiguous moral premise of trying to fix the world through death and deciet. Bakuman's more about the struggle of the artistic process while trying to maintain mainstream success.
lol Luna face
did my Fluttershy just swear?
rofl
Yus.
YES
I must go play Skyrim now, cya :D
I feel that Bakuman's cast of character has been done before. Death Note was original.
How many of these videos are there?
show the one where heavy and scout visit ponyville
11,01Fucking ignored

thx
maybe. didn't play morrowind
Pinkie swear?
so much ponage
05next project, fluttershy with that hat n those glasses
Death Note was original, yes, but it had the issue of only having 2 interesting characters, 1 of which dies half-way through the series. This means there's very little keeping the plot going save a long succesion of twists. Bakuman, while being less original in its cast, fleshes them out allows them to bounce off eachother and act as foils to one another.
emangamer: Pinkie Quest
Yes please Wrek
/me is SOOOOOO BORKED
RAWRity: you and your text walls

also, does anyone think "Mysterious Mare-do-well was the weakest ep in Friendship is Magic so far?
^
I like dragging RD around by the tail
yeah shes done that twice on mine
i liked it
I say, Cutie Pox was the weakest episode of the season.
well it's enjoyable
Myster... Over a Barrel wasn't worse?
no
hey guys my friend made a fan fic
hell no
want the link?
Over a Barrel was GREAT
Over a Barrel had a good song though
RD is so cute especially when she sleeps on the cloud
I really liked read it and weep
fanfics are good
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/12429/Revenge
You guys want my episode ratings?
do a barrel roll
flutter_spin: sure
episode ratings?
flutter_spin: yes plz
how do we chage the person whos streaming
um
11,01[22:50:37]	otakon	also, does anyone think "Mysterious Mare-do-well was the weakest ep in Friendship is Magic so far? <- It was the weakest of S2.
Uh
Brony4Life: the streamers decide that.
we need a techie
Brony4Life: u are now streaming!
really?
no
I didn't update it but its for 41 episodes
Nittany_Discord: well I meant the WHOLE series so far really
1,3you have to pull their cartridge out of the slot, blow it out a few times, and put a new one in the slot
If Mare-Do-Well had been part of Season 1, I doubt it'd get even half of the flak it gets right now.
11,01I dunno compared to the whole season.
^
So judging from that alone, no, it's not the worst
At all.
Brony4Life: it will change if you.....BELIIIIIEEEEEEEVE
What kind of software would I need to make my own stream?
1(15)	02 (28)	The Return of Harmony Part 2
lol
1,3at least 5 internets
Daring Do needs to make a comeback
well hangon
Derpy needs a side series
CCCP: so true
hmm maybe
11,01I feel bad for the writer that her first episode was mediocre, but she improved with Hearth's Warming Eve.
CriticKitten: maybe. maybe not. But I honestly have to say that it's on of the few episodes that I didn't find myself enjoying.
Nittany_Discord: I'm ready when you are...
yh
mexican soap operas are violent
Nittany_Discord: what was her first ep again?
11,01No-one's even offered to restream me.
Nittany_Discord: I feel sorry for the shit she got, saying she was ruining the series.
I'm just going to type it out heh. There are a lot of additional info
11,01The Mysterious Mare-do-well.
hey streamers pls pick another streamer
Nittany: I think it's more that Mare-Do-Well took place after several solid eps.
1,3haven't seen you ask either Nittany :p
streamers for a party
11,01I didn't ask here.
oh it wasn't that bad really people over react to much
1: Return of Harmony Part 2 2: Return of Harmony Part 1 3: Dragonshy 4: Bridle Gossip
trixe wont stop staring at me
Nittany_Discord but...but...but... I got my other computer up and running
11,01No offense, but I'm not getting much attention today in some places.
5: Friendship is Magic Part 1 6: Friendship is Magic Part 2 7: Secret of My Excess 8: Lesson Zero
RAWRity: I didn't say it wasn't weak. Only that it's not nearly as bad as it's proclaimed to be. It's probably mediocre and would've been a middle-of-the-road ep for S1.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rpes8HekUw HA, I love discovering old anime songs.
Nittany_Discord: what's wrong man?
/me glomps Nittany_Discord <3
11,01Well, I was/am worrying myself to death.
11,01Over finances.
Nittany needs more wub
9: A Dog and Pony Show 10: The Last Roundup 11: The Best Night Ever 12: Boast Busters
well don't
11,01They always get me down.
but i thought you wanted winning
11,01I'm not making money and I'm nearly broke, so it's got me down.
But since it arrived during S2 when expectations were higher, combined with the fact that it preceded several other strong eps, that has led to people making it out to be way worse than it was
Nittany_Discord: well keep looking
*whining
11,01I don't have time for work.
man, if we dont play portal I'mma be pissed
13: Luna Eclipsed 14: Baby Cakes 15: Sisterhooves Social 16: Griffon the Brush Off 17: Suited for Success
11,01It's all tied up in school.
Nittany_Discord: well you have to MAKE time
Cutie Pox, Owl's Well, and Mare do Well at the bottom 3 for me.
this was a triumph
Nittany_Discord: you can't do school if your utterly broke
11,01I know.
im making a note here
18: Sweet and Elite 19: Party of One 20: Sonic Rainboom
huge success
11,01But when I have to use it all doing my thesis, what am I going to do.
it's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Honestly, I was less fond of the Rarity eps than of MDW....
Nittany_Discord: you have to make time damn it!
11,01There's another problem.
Nittany_Discord: theseus*
Hello!
some one become streamer and put on avast fluttershys ass
They have the same problem as MDW, except arguably worse in some places. >_>
00,10any one else want to play?
21: Winter WrapUp 22: Family Appreciation Day 23: Hearth's Warming Eve 24: Ticket Master 25: May the Best Pet Win
play what?
Sumica: I'll pass, it's late and if I do badly I curse out loud
11,01Even if I got one, it would have to pay a lot per hour for it to pay for all of my expenses.
Aperture science, we do what we must because we can ohai CantSleepMustRead, lol
I didn't like Owl's Well That Ends Well
my favorite episodes… hmmm
Sumica wanna restream Nittany_Discord so we cna play portal?
avast fluttershys ass
Pony Swag!
26: A Bird in the Hoof 27: Applebuck Season 28: Look Before You Sleep 29: The Mysterious Mare Do Well 30: Green Isn't Your Color
11,01$12/hour. Only sales jobs are offering that.
I've a being a hatred. I can only name my least favorite episodes.
Doesn't help that Rarity's flaw tends to be portrayed as the exact opposite of her element, which wasn't the intention. >.>
00,10running a tf2 server atm emangamer
Nittany_Discord: well dude, it seems you have to choose one or the other at this point
:3 Twilight reading dawwwww
dammit....
*of hatred*
11,01otakon: You sound like my mom.

11,01Which isn't helping.
for the goood of all of us, except the ones that are dead..
Nittany_Discord: well, not sure how to take that.
31: Fall Weather Friends 32: The Cutie Pox 33: The Cutie Mark Chronicles ... sadly I don't like the CMC that much
Nittany: yfw otakon is secretly your mother
I am not
but there's no use crying over every mistake, you just keeep on trying till you run out of cake
im starteing to like CMC more
11,01Eee.

kirz: So the new expression is "BY NITTANY'S MOM'S BEARD!", then?
Nittany_Discord: well good luck with that
mario_pony: :)

how long does it take to pick a streamer
11,01I don't have time to work enough to pay my bills.
Nittany_Discord: well you need to borrow money then and get your thesis done ASAP
i converted my dog to a brony
11,01That's my plan.
This chat got depressing
It's not the beard on the outside that counts, it's the beard on the inside.
00,10use connect in the console
CupcakeWarrior: it is not
I'M HAPPY
Im so depressed i hate life and everything in it
Nittany: If it's a school loan you need....get private loans through a bank. The interest rate will be lower than federal loans.
good job CCCP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU&ob=av3e
Yeah, so when they had the marathon I voted my episodes.
^ makes me happy
11,01I don't think a bank will give me a loan w/o a job with this economy.
My federal student loans have almost twice the interest rate. >.<
I'm even more depressed. I need to stop paying attention to politics
I learned an important lesson today from Ballad of the Brony: GRIFFINS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
everyone join red

11,01I would only need $1400 for the month.
every thing is hoorible and boring, Happines is just a distraction from life and life.... life sucks
this is what i worry about
If they would give me countless thousands to pursue my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, you should be able to pull off a small loan.
what will happen to me when i grow up
00,10be warned i ahve never tested it like this so it could lag to hell and back.
WE NEED A STREAMER THIS INSTANT OR THIS CHAT WILL BE TORN APART
Even without a job. It'd help if your mom will offer to co-sign, too.
Having a ton of children is the best distraction from life.
/me 11,01wishes WSI would pay me for doing my thesis.
1,3calm down Brony4Life
it will not Brony4Life calm down
11,01It's based on their work.
rawr
For some reason I really didn't like Over a Barrel. It seemed like things got worse and worse. The setting wasn't in Ponyville and that Applejack's cousin annoyed me to death
ok
why sir, this chat has never been happier and healthier *looks at the depressed faces* see?
For me, it was out of place.
11,01The person who wrote the paper I'm basing my research on was paid for doing pretty much the same thing.
11,01And then paid again.
don't worry be happy it will soon pass
IVE NEVER SEEN OVER A BARRLE
should we vote on what to see?
hey there, everypony
hi Tao-mell
what's streaming at the moment?
do a barrelroll
What the hell. Why is it that weathermen can be CONSISTENTLY wrong and still keep their jobs?
nuthin
hi Tao-mell
11,01Over a Barrel is meh, but Pinkie carries the episode well.
The owl episode dragged for a long time. I don't think anything "happened" in that episode
Nittany_Discord: I liked it
Nittany_Discord, student loans?
"Small chance of a mix of rain and snow today." I look outside, it's clearly snowing.
ima brohoof /)(\
11,01CriticKitten: *handwave* Computer models.
not even ponies are making me happy any more.
(ugh, this song always gets to me)
ugh...no portal I guess :'(
One thing bugged me about Swarm of the Century. Pinkie KNEW about the parasprites, but no one seemed to ask her what to do. It urked me the entire episode
11,01Nope. Sorry.
portulz
Howdy everypony.
flutter_spin: yet, Twitchy Tail gets them listening though
CCCP: your making me depressed :(
1,3*irked
Nittany: I can predict the weather better than they do with their computer models. It's winter, so, I PREDICT THAT IT'LL BE COLD WITH A CHANCE OF SNOW. GEE WHAT A SHOCK.
hiya Everlasting_Joy
its all in how you look at things
ohai Everlasting_Joy!
mario_pony: sorry
11,01Persistence forecasting.
flutter_spin: yeah, the episodes that revolve around simple mistunderstandings always bug me.
yeah. I mistype when I'm tired.
MahBoi777 This salutation is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
Howdy otakon.
you have a choice
How can they seriously keep getting on air every day and report something that's so wrong that you can tell they're wrong by LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW?
11,01That's nowcasting.
/me looks out window
11,01Try forecasting tomorrow.
oooh nyan cat
CriticKitten: bc it's a PREDICTION and it's not 100% accurate EVER
They don't get tomorrow right, either
Or the next day
Show Stoppers was... an embarrasment? I don't know. I guess I wanted them to get cutie marks or something. Just reminded me of the bad memories when I was a kid.
Its cold during winter. Proof that Global Warming is a european socialist kenyan lie.

Sooo for those wandering Sumica server ip is 71.53.161.58:27015 use console to connect~
otakon: Then why bother with 14-day forecasts?
11,01Yeah.
11,0114-days is a crap-shoot.
We can all agree tht the return of harmony was amazing?
If you can't get it accurate within 24 hours, why bother trying to predict 14 full days?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-sCrhRPCMg
CCCP yes.
11,01There are measures of accuracy (skill).
00,10cant seem to get scrncap to see fml now.
ooh. Thunder and Lightning tomorrow
11,01We're pretty damn accurate for 24 hours.
Not around here. ._.
Feeling Pinkie Keen would have gone up in rating IF she used her abilities in other episodes. To have her suddenly get these predictions killed the episode. Then to only see them in the Mare Do Well episode.
The guy I listen to on the radio has been wrong virtually every single day.
11,01Just because operational meteorologists are wrong some of the time don't mean they're wrong all of the time.
He also said we'd get 5-7 inches tonight.
11,01Especially when 3 models are telling them 3 different things.
/me looks outside. There's not even one inch.
I loved Feeling Pinkie Keen's moral.
11,01Where do you live CriticKitten?
Indiana, South Bend
good evening all :)

Howdy tgl1992.

They tend to predict stuff so consistently wrong that I almost don't wanna bother listening to their reports any more. XD
dat TF2
augh. my stomach I need meat the way I knead dough
omFg!!! I love Heavy!! Hes freaking indestructable!! (sorry for the randomness) :D
CCCP: are you emmo?

mario_pony: luckly
Howdy CuddlyKittens11
No one else going to share their preferences on episodes?
Nittany: This morning, it was 5-7 inches of snow and a snow warning.
I dont exactly have a preference.
flutter+spin: what do youmean?
Go Sumica go!
My kids were planning to skip tomorrow.
If I like it I like it.
guys
11,01Though I'd say they busted on that prediction today as well.
CCCP: cranky doodle donkey
ping me if you need me ok?
00,10need to drop stream badwidth.
What episodes you find best, worse, and why?
is ANYONE suprised that EqD has over 100million hits so far?
What!?!
11,01Are you still under a winter storm warning?
what server is this i see a scootaloo
otakon no.
mario_pony: i am a cranky doodle donky
How are you scootaloo???
hmm, I'd actually say that the first two episodes in the series were the worst.
flutter_spin: I liek them all, lol
Probably not.
Theres so much about TF2 that i need to learn :'(
only Pinkie pie can cheer me up
damn, mfw I'm only halfthrough Ballad of the Brony
When I'm showing my friends the series, I actually start with the sonic rainbom one
If we are, then someone screwed up XD
CCCP: hmmm maybe some cute kittens or babies or both will make you happy
otakon, consider that fact that it's basically where all the news goes, it has become the center of the MLP:FiM fannon universe.
indeed
I think MLP took maybe 6 episodes to get going with the older audience
mario_pony: rather have ponies
I wonder when it will get to 200 Million
MLP was supposedly an instant hit, according to Know Your Meme
CCCP: some filly ponies?
11,01Check your local NWS office's website.
Mentlegen.
mario_pony: mabey
Really? I thought the first two episodes were quite strong actually
11,01http://www.nws.noaa.gov/largemap.php
I didn't "hate"MLP FiM right off the bat when I first heard about it
CriticKitten: agreed
CriticKitten: well for intros it's fairly standard but good
I thought bronies were gay when I heard about it
^
Perhaps not aimed at an older audience, but....well....show is technically aimed primarily at younger audiences, it's just meant to be watchable for older viewers. >_>
11,01I never thought bronies were gay.
dat stream quality
When people mentioned watching MLP, I thought ".... my little pony is a tv show?"
mario_pony: :3
damn
went to work there
/me wants to embrace gay bronies.
its starting to make me happy
otakon: I thought it was pretty standard, sure, but it's a strong start.
I never thot bronies were gay O.o
eeyup
first time I ever saw like a little clip of the show, it was from a random YTP, lol
I had absolutely no prior experience of mlp until I heard about bronies
CCCP: http://fast1.onesite.com/capcom-unity.com/user/ragingbulletbill/0ca50ac87d3dd1abb573978b7238bdab.png?v=98240
I love haters of the show
00,10so how bad is stream?
okay, I am REALLY digging ballad of the brony
:)
How i became a brony?
CCCP you too?
I just knew it was a toy
I think 25% of bronies are gay. … nah I just made that up
ohhh i cant hold it back
?^
I love reading/watching the haters too!
Everlasting_Joy: i LOVE and Tolerate haters
indeed
Streams good Sumica
^
Who knows how it really happened. I remember seeing the Skyrim mods, maybe the Learn Your Meme video, then it just happened. I do recall seeing Season 2 Episode 4 live.
Haters: Y U SO SILLY?
love and tolerate
CCCP I especially love the ones who have never seen the show before.
It does everything your first two episodes should do. Introduces the characters with a fair amount of time spent filling them in, introduces a terrible threat to confront and a magical macguffin to defeat it with, and even does a decent job with the "stereotypical" stuff it does, like "the power was inside us all along".
Everlasting_Joy: i agree
Intesive Pony Unit -> Bronies are Fags -> Reaction to: Bronies are Fag -> Don't have bronies as friends: episode 1 -> Episode 1
I just watched an episode of mlp just to see how gay it was
I'll be back
Became a brony :D
Next thing you know, I am brony
^^
CupcakeWarrior: dont be homophobic
CCCP: http://newsimg.ngfiles.com/250000/250929_131483158391.jpg
Yeah, I watched one episode at a time and finished them all in a week
I watched it because CR implied that he liked it.
CupcakeWarrior: LOL, watchin an episode of something you hate? that makes sense
the night i watched my first episode i ended up watching all of season 1
I used to be soooo homophobic O__o
I'm not going to type my story out here.
Then I learned it was Laura Faust.
I pretty much marathon'd the show once I got through the first two.
Then my best friend came out of the closet -_-
Laura Faust? whos that?
To get through all of season one.
lol
Ravebrony: me too kinda weird
I'm like "OH MY WORD ITS POWERPUFF GAL"
mario_pony: YAY!!!! I dont care! about being sad shes soooooo cute :3 :D YAY YAY THANK YOU <3 <3 <3 YAAAA! i <3 life yaayayay
I could never truely be homophobic. I just can't hold fake grudges like that.
Hey, PPG was the Shit back when i was younger!
^
I mean, I wasn't
wow, dat mood chang, lol
totally
i didnt find out about Faust until a week after i watched my first episode
RaveBrony: it is STILL the SHTI
SHIT
^ damn right!
Hello LadyCanary :).
:D
Ohai Everlasting_Joy
I fished season 1 in one night
otakon agree 100%
Then I learned of the VA from the Bronycon. I'm like "OH MY WORD PP = FS"
oh LordCelestia canaries are YELLOW
OH what a wonderful place
yfw my favorite superhero is Black Canary, otakon.
and i owe it all to the...
OWND
I became a brony, finished season one, asked my friends if they had seen it, got laughed at, went on EQD, then found this website :) <3
Pegasus race if i knew the ground
LadyCanary: yh true, but have you seen LC's pic?
Yes :3

My girlfriend still wont watch mlp:[
I discovered EQD & Bronystate from the online chats posted about Derpy
i'd of come here sooner and never leave
well I wasn't saying it's bad or anything
YES i love every thing!
^
RaveBrony: i pretty much have the same story
LordCelestia: good job man
Now that MLP airs at 1pm, it'll be pretty hard to hide.
ithink i might be bi-polar

CupcakeWarrior: lol jk

LadyCanary: no
once upon a tiem, I made a sandwich THE END
flutter_spin: nope
o.o
My brother and I were going to play Star Trek Online, but had to come up with some names for our ship
When we met, we had the best ships in the universe
oh come on
3v1
His ship was the U.S.S. Bacon and mine was the U.S.S. Donut
LadyCanary: Actually, Date's Engrish is so hilarious because I totally picture Pinkie Pie playing Date.
"HAVE A PARTY!"
flutter_spin Ha! I love those names.
...
Somebody. Draw that.

Pinkie Masamune.
It's been done.
LOL S.S.Donut and S.SBacon are great names

I wish I had animation skill, I would've already tried it.
this one time at band camp....
And Oyakata samaaaaa will be Celestia, CriticKitten.
Did I just see Scootaloo?
My whole life is a story. I could go on for awhile talking about it.
Those mods. . .
i got a flute and....
OH GOD

How....how do you become a pony in TF2 o.o is there a place when i can read up Everything i need to know about this stuff??
"I, Twilight Sparkle, shall do my best to defend all of Ponyville with these spears of mine, Celestia-sama!" "TWILIGHT SPARKLE!" "CELESTIA-SAMA!" "TWILIGHT SPARKLE!" "CELESTIA-SAMA!"
I had a programming class in college. "Advanced Programming"
It was the worse class ever. I actually failed the class.
CriticKitten: What anime are you talking about?
Well ok, so about 3/4 of the class failed it.
and iiiiii willl always looove yooouuuu!!!!!
Our instructor was Mr. Mellon. We called him mellonhead
Oh dang O_o
Doesnt sound like a fun class...

Sengoku Basara. It's pretty much what you get if you take all the awesome in every anime ever and distill it down into its manliest form.
He refused to give out 100s, because "no one is perfect"
CupcakeWarrior: Sengoku Basara. Originally it was a game called Dynasty Warriors.
Highest grade you could get was a 99
Well guys, its been fun. See ya all later.
CriticKitten: Does it have an english dub?
The character designs were very different than the ones in the anime.
wake me up when September ends
Bye September!
/me is back
bye September
It does, CupcakeWarrior.
Farewell September.
And it's pretty darn good.

It's SO much funnier
Little High! Little Low!
Actually if you did everything he told you in an assignment, you would get a 75. If he liked what else you did in addition, you worked your way to a 99
The show isn't the same without Date Masamune's Engrish
Little Hey Little Ho
Anyway the wiiiind bloooooows
omg
The min passing grade of that assignment was a 75

MahBoi777 (\
All this talk of Basura reminds me that I need to watch Brave 10.
True, CriticKitten. Still, both are good. Oichi is my favorite <3
Aye
Youre awesome for knowing that :D
RaveBrony:/)
LOL
quien aqui abla espanol?
And I love Oichi! She's my fav character from Basara 3.
My ex and I actually wanted to go as Nagamasa and Oichi but THAT wont happen xD
He would give us code that would "benefit us". The problem was that the code didn't work.
I loved that movie
We would come back and tell him "hey, this code that is supposed to do what you told us doesn't work"
He would come back (and troll) "Yeah, did you figure it out? I told you I would lead you down the rosey path"
Though I also liked Nobunaga and Ieyasu in Basara 3, they had fun play styles.
The former wields a sword in one hand and a shotgun in the other. How can you not have fun with that? >_>
He would come into class, say "be right back" and run down some coffee. He'd be gone for 20min into class time
power up the bass cannon
fire
It was one of the reasons why I never did graduate from college, even though I went 5 years
CriticKitten: I havent played any of the Dynasty Warriors game, though I've heard such great things about it. Ive seen my ex play Sengoku Basara for the PS2.
Dynasty Warriors 3 & 4. 5 is cutting it
11,01Timed out.
;-; I just had a nostalgiagasm
connection dropout
crash ?
00,10Gonna lower number of bots
11,01I have DW 4.
Kinda, looks like it fixed itself
11,01*6
Whoa!
00,10but also crashed
11,01Server crashed?
Sengoku Basara is basically a derivative of Dynasty Warriors that "anime'd it up"
DW3 was all about pre-designed awesome weapons you could get. It made you overpowered.
With an EPIC THEME SONG.
Dynasty Warriors is a silly game
abingdon boys school <3
00,10gonna have to learn how to set a real server instead of just finding out you can join my bot match.
DW4 was very well balanced and less cartoony. You could also customize your epic weapons.
It made the fights much more flashy, the humor more absurd, etc
Power up the bass cannon...
11,01And I was doing well too.
FIRE!!
CriticKitten: eeyup, it's fairly good too
And it really does it so well
I never did get DW5/DW6. I was moving during that time.
Nittany_Discord: OH, so you'll play with him, but not me?
I see how it is
We definitely have to convince somepony to stream the anime some day.
:'(
11,01I would play if I could stream.
Nittany_Discord: I know, I'm beign a silly filly ,3

Oh noes
00,10ok server should be coming up now.

otakon: Probably a good idea
indeed
It's definitely up his alley too
LOL
DW2 was horrible. 3&4 were good. I think 5&6 had crazy interaction fights
do any of you mods have Dark Cloud 1/2? I would love to see that streamed
Oh hey, more Pinkie Date.

08,01so has anyone here seen Labyrinth?
EVERYTHAAAAAANG
08,01we watched it in here a few months ago
that was a weird film
;3;
LadyCanary: you know you want Bowie
...I aint gonna lie.
08,01do you remember the bit with the guards?
I think I only half-watched Labyrinth
He's a freak. Me gusta
08,01one of them tells the truth, and the other one lies
....Trixie von Karma. YES
LadyCanary: you crazy girl
I'm just a bit mad, otakon~
It's a classic logic thing
LadyCanary: why mad?
08,01she asks them "if i asked him (points to the other guard), would he tell me this door leads to the castle?"
mad as in crazy otakon
oh
well considering where we are
good lord, my brain has melted...
LadyCanary is best mental patient ^_^
it's pratically a REQUIREMENT of a fan at this point
emangamer: even more so than Barking Mad?
um
wat?
LadyCanary: you've done it before?
that makes NO sense
08,01so i just formulated that puzzle into propositional logic, converted it to conjunctive normal form, and solved it using the DPLL algorithm as an example of an instance of the propositional satisfiability problem
u ean screw loose? lol
*mean
well i ave to go to bed
08,01i put a reference to labyrinth in my bibliography.

Night mario_pony.
Good night mario_pony!
08,01otakon: basically, i solved it without using my brain (i used an algorithm instead)
08,01and included it in my essay
Because brains are for smart people.
LadyCanary: I think you would look really pretty
But thats how my brain solved it
^^"
Ish
08,01Dumorimasoddaa: using dpll?
LadyCanary: yfw I remember what you look like
Everlasting_Joy: I GOT BRAINS!!!! I just don't have anything useful to use them on atm....

Actually, I am guilty of skipping the themesong the first time.
for some reason anytime i try to ply tf2 it freezes durin loadin
So make that 99.99999999%

YourLittleDashie: also, next time use derpy.me to shorten your links
Ok Ill do that now...

emangamer: I didn't say nuthin, lol
Here's the plushie: http://derpy.me/xGTKf

=(
silly Tovler...3/4ths time is for losers
:'(
Link works for me?
sorry
it worked for me
doesn't even load a page for me
If plushies weren't so expensive, I'd buy one for each Mane 6
otakon: 75 dollar RD plushie that looks legit with 20 dollaars shipping
hmmm
nice YourLittleDashie
if I reload the page it works
hi PartyCannon
almost. 3/4s is for lovers. 1 letter off
I have to play cheap. $2 for blind bag RD figure will have to do
odd it didn't work the first time opening
Thanks <MahBoi777>
Tovler: nope... 6/8ths time is where it's at
so... no stream
YourLittleDashie: you just have to type the name, no marks required
Hiya Phase4 I'm afraid not
hi otakon
or also $2 for McDonalds RD figure coming up in a couple weeks
YourLittleDashie: try this
YourLittleDashie: press e and then hit tab
emangamer: cool beans
YourLittleDashie: yea saves plenty of time
the tab button is AWESOME
emangamer: Thanks
I assume you guys saw the stats graph on EQD. That is crazy
otakon: btw...I didnt like that video you linked...it didnt describe me at all
Tab... LIKE THE SODA
dat tab
LOL
YourLittleDashie: best feature ever
Phase4: Thanks
and now... TIME FOR RANDOMNESS
/me wave at everypony
you would not belive what is on tv here
I liek randomness
/me waves at Rainbow-Dash
ohai RainbowJack
RainbowJack: *
:'(:S:(;):D:|6_9
hey RainbowJack
emangamer: what video?
hello
hai thar RainbowJack
Hello RainbowJack
otakon: derpy reaction video
emangamer: I didn't do it to describe you, I linked it bc IT WAS FUNNEH!
otakon: you know my feelings about that scene
whats up Bronystate
Phase4: What's on TV?
http://youtu.be/vnwKFg1F-vI
sup RainbowJack
there are too many people with rainbow or dash in there name I get so confused
/me was just finding a link
RainbowJack: I'M FURIOUS
theres an octocat in it
It is crazy because I didn't know about the Derpy fandom until AFTER the episode
emangamer: besides, it said the AVERAGE brony reaction. You not enjoying one iota of Derpy in that scene is DEFINITELY not average.
Phase4: WAT
ikr
otakon: but STATISTICALLY it should describe me
and it didnt
so I blame you
After I saw the reaction post, I learned everything about Derpy
what ya mean MahBoi777?
emangamer: statistics and average are related but not the same
I just don't know what went wrong!
I be angry
otakon: but it still STASTICALLY should describe me...you cant say it doesnt add up that way
I didn't have a reaction, sadly. I just sort of smiled like after hearing Junebug talk
YourLittleDash thats Derpy's line
I NEED SOME ENTERTAINMENT
RainbowJack: I know LOL
/me juggles chainsaws
emangamer: seriously, you are one of the few that didn't enjoy a DIRECT SHOUTOUT TO THE BRONY FANDOM FROM THE CREATORS FOR THE LULZ!!!!
MahBoi777: OMG be careful!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obdLhRTfDFo There: Watch the lava lamp.
otakon: I didnt say I didnt enjoy it, I just found it forced and am afriad of the consequences of that scene
flutter_spin: I do love that video
/me accidentally drops one
LOOK OUT
MahBoi777: was it a bass?
flutter_spin: THIS IS 20% MORE ENTERTAINING: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqrd8R-b5SQ&feature=related
emangmer: whuzzat?
emangamer: HOW was it forced? it was completely unexpected and EVEN SET UP THE SCENE to encourage AJ to win the 1st Prize for the money to repair the Town Hall.
YourLittleDashie: that was....weird
otakon: everything PAST the roof was forced
emangamer: whuzzat?
*chainsaw flies towards me* AHHHH TELL DADDY i LOVE HIM!!
you want entertainment i'll give you entertainment http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhiJwfj0URs
emangamer: LOLX
MahBoi777: I found the derpy scene forced and was a afraid of the implications
emangamer: like wat? like AJ being ashamed of not winning the prize money and not wanting to admit it to her friends? I NEED AN EXAMPLE here
oh god what am i watching
that spliced show is still on
DeathStar: OMG I LOVE THIS SONG I SANG IT IN HISTORY CLASS IN 6TH GRADE!
emangamer: ohhh, lol
otakon: I mean breaking the ground or just fucking up RD... that was too much and made her out to be a walking diaster that everyone SHOULD hate
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SXpwah0KKo : Favorite Animanaics Scene. I still sing it today.
flutter_spin: that is a good one
DeathStar taught me about time zones, lol
:)
and now I know
emangamer: and yet OTHER characters with those VERY SAME traits are loved and treated as classic icons. The lovable klutz isn't a bad thing, Derpy at this point is like homage to Goofy I'd say.
otakon: I fucking hate goofy... and they OVER did it with derpy...
00,10Thanks for the help with UAC seems I had turned it off but the system had more updates that were precenting things from being done
I found some entertainment by opening this video in 10 tabs at once: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRGbrs83wRA
ohai Sumica
00,10ohhi
emangamer: they DIDN'T overdo it. have you SEEN the crap Pinkie pulls on a regular basis? how about RD's unbelievable resistance to injury hmmm?
YourLittleDashie: Mother of God......lol
otakon: read it and weep...HA read it and weep (see what I ddid there?)
Sorry I left on accident 9_6
lalalaaaaalalalalalaaaaa :P I love that vid
ikr?
it's so catchy and easy to remember
emangamer: like I said, RESISTANCE. not IMMUNITY, and no one was friggin yelling "THEY WENT TOO FAR!!! RD CAN'T GET HURT THAT BAD!!!!!
CUPCAKES
Sweet Apple Massacre
no YourLittleDashie
Friendship is Tragic
don't mention those plz
What conversation did I lose out on?
otakon: umm...I have no bucking clue what your saying
otakon: besides, pinkie is ACTUALLY funny
Fine... My Little Dashie
Pink Memories
The Wild Blue Yonder
otakon: no, what I say is funny, IS funny
OH WAIT
emangamer: I am SURE there is a fan out there that just thinks Pinkie is not funny AT ALL.
otakon: not possible
otakon: nope...
emangamer: oh yes
my humor is ALL humor
:3
hmmm, no kick?
I thought Derpy was a random pony trying to do something right, but perhaps takes awhile to figure it out. The deep voice was a derp from the VA, which ... adds to the derp of the eyes which.... I guess build character?
derp derp
flutter_spin: nah...not really
flutter_spin: well, Tabitha was trying for her neighbor's son, she didn't realize Derpy was a girl
I'm bsck
*back
emangamer: besides at this point it was just another shout out. Look at the Big Lebowski ponies in "Cutie Pox"
holy god theres a twilight parody on abc 3
otakon: I dont see the connection
xD
Phase4: WAT
I usually stand neutral. If Derpy does these things, it is something that Derpy does. I actually found it admiring that Rainbow Dash was doing her best to help out someone who obviously needed it
a show called 'you're skitting me'
good, they need to make fun of Twilight
emangamer: that was a reference ONLY OLDER VIEWERS OF THE SHOW WOULD GET. DERPY IS A LITTLE ADD IN FOR THE OLDER VIEWERS OF THE SHOW.
Phase4: LOL
otakon: I still dont see your point
otakon: we'll have to discuss this over skype one day
I'm so boreddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
:[
/me hands YourLittleDashie a paddleball:D
A horrible reference to the older audience is when Fluttershy blushed at the beginning of Cider episode. Majority of people didn't get it. I didn't get it. Only in chat were "oh she's naked, hahaha"
emangamer: no, nvm, your just being too thickheaded to see wat I'm getting at. you hate derpy, everyone else loved it, end of story I am done.
YourLittleDashie: http://youtu.be/_hnYKFQSsGA?t=26s
MahBoi777: YAYZ
i cant belive this is real
otakon: I doubt that, statistically :3
Phase4: LOLZ

Dismo: what are you talking about?
emangamer: I've said nothing more then what was already talked about in chat
Some people feel knowing what future episodes are about, even from synopsis, are spoilers
Dismo: well I dont know what your talking about
Dismo: so clearly its a spoiler
emangamer: Whatever you say.
flutter_spin: dat arm flail, lol
I dont take to spoilers lightly
So avoiding synopsis, video plugins, song leaks, or otherwise may ruin the experience
emangamer: How can I give spoilers?
you spoiled it......U MUST DIE, like that?
Dismo: I seriously have no fucking clue what your talking about
emangamer: I've only taked about what I've heard in chat.

YAY I'M A IDIOT!

Radical Girl scouts`-.-
Sounds legit
String_Shredder: oh no, ofc not.
Also, "All the rest are feminists, lesbians, or Communists"
inb4 they go after the boy scouts
Guys, we don't like X, let's call it communism!
The Boy Scouts are proudly anti-gay so they're all good.
That's good
String_Shredder: they are ATTACKING The Lorax film, Arriety from Studio Ghibli AND The Muppets, saying ALL of them are pushing liberal "agenda's"
What are you all talking about?
RaveBrony: FOX News being an insufferable prick
O_o
...
A center for RECOVERING GIRL SCOUTS?
Lol, what else is new? :D
WHAT.
Indeed.
Even worse, he wrote, only three of the 50 role models promoted by the Girl Scouts have even "a briefly-mentioned religious background." What's wrong with not being religious?
String_Shredder: not all of us
most of us
There should be a first quotation mark there
Jim: to the right wing, if your not religious your EVIL

Kammerjunk: <~Underdose> we're arrogant, you're ignorant
Kammerjunk: <~Underdose> get it right <3
xcanox: That's not even a generalisation, it's a stereotype at best.

Til his feet become bloody and tired

Buried deep in the pits of his heart
The lock of gray hair that she gave to him
Stayed clutched in his fist through the night
Dead or alive, she still yearned for him

completley different translation for me
So, D'angelo means… the angel?
D'angel face in the mirror,Capelli d'angelo, D'angelo prisonIn the mirror scene of violenceThe tremble without his embraceBarbed wire in the mirror velvetHis trembling like VestaA precious silence for the massesBlindness, the hope becomes ashesPass, breathing easilyThe show his thoughts on peace
Not exactly
o jeez

ofna01: no really, your stuff LOOKS JUST LIKE THE SHOW, it's really good.
and when i told them i drew it,they were so suprised
ofna01: also, I am already watching you on DA, are you ever going to continue that one comic story you started?
not sure
I should probably ask if that's something I'm allowed to say Ingwaz, but no one's online to ask right now.
I just made my mom a brony.... I don't even.
it has a LOT of potential though
nick: nice
also, brb biobreak
nick Watch ponies together
We do, just on different computers
biobreak? have to go to the little fillies room?
Pshh, my parents shun the show... :D
Yeah, I understand what you're saying, but it's not my business to disclose details, so I can't really tell you. :/
Ayup Ingwaz
She was also wearing a portal shirt at the time.
:o
My mom is the best, objectivly
Ok. :>
nick: not something you should really say online
?
you'll understand wen you're older
Ima play a quick round of TF2 to practice before Wrek starts drawing :P
