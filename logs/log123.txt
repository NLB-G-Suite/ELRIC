And wouldn't that really apply to all of 'em?
I would've actually though Rainbow dash would see in her other Everything she hated in herself
It really depends on their personalities
Nah. Rainbow Dash she's the talent and potential more than anything.
Well, yeah, RD's nature doesn't make her go for her counterpart
*sees
Oh well, I'mma readin' this chap now
Plus, she doesn't get the benefit of her opposite having a different name
Rarity is just a romantic at heart
I don't think you could;ve possibly kept her away from herself
the logs you say? http://www.drtoy.com/images/construction/clip_image038.jpg
Rarity KNEW she would fall for herself, and ASSURED her own success because she knows herself that well.

Season 2 begins in 6d:01h:44m:17s
and Spike's reaction to Elusive
would be awesome
well since i was beating up Fluttershy.. heck no
I have a feeling they would both tam up to break up Elusive and Rarity, and after failing, start liking each other instead.

Very nice story.

Its very good
by the story
alrighty
those are synonyms
.-.
8a Flutterghost...oh gawd
I don't think si
*so
Although, I like the "ButterBabe" reference
no hard feelings (turns from shipfic into sadfic)
because Spines makes a remark the Fluttershy's voice is just like Butterbabes
/me runs off to try and make an actual ponyself.
FallSilently: I might keep that
i saw they wanted voice actors, which would have been great to try out for
Hrrm
Darkblaze Gleaming
again, too overthe top
I just realized...
yeah?
XDX
haha
This means there needs to be an "Evil Enchantress - ButterBabe version"!
nah though i don't really like ships much anyway for the record.. combat me bro's
8ic
It MUST BE DONE!
Lordlyhour: wait, was that in response to Darkblaze?
Except it would be "Evil enchanter
yes, yes it was
…aww
I rather liked it

okay, i must be off again. back in about an hour

well some.. but not most in this fandom lol
lol dnater
shuttup
He's and evil enchanter, and a villainous dancer
He's an evil enchanter, he spouts evil banter.
I can;t think of a word, that fits and rhymes with anter!
Wow.
Lordlyhour: can I at least keep the Gleaming part?
Greaming is good
Merely A Mare deserves 6 stars and a commendation thing.
:3
I want moar.
gleaming
Merely a Mare?
/yess/
now
What's it about?
He's and evil enchanter, and a villainous dancer, he'll hypnotise you with his magical banter
Its technically a shipping fic, but its very light.
Continue song as normal I think
Its about Luna making amends with the element.
*elements
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-merely-mare.html
Hrrm
This fanon Luna is fantastic.
I skipped past it.
On account of the shipping
I was skeptical and skipped past it a few times.
But its REALLY good.
sure depends on the song
Unless the Writers REALLY went out of their way to bend for us (god I hope not) there is going to be a lot of fanon trod on
/me <----- Doesn't read shipping samesex shipping. Nothing against it, I just prefer het shipping.
Reeeead it.

*dismissive hoofwave* that's not the point
8ah
But it IS, Blacklight. You're being a picky picky-pants. :P
Don't Synonimise
…oh
/me quits Dictionary
go or something that is barely related
or not even related at all
i gotta watch that anime again.. i did when i was really young apparently but i don't hardly remember it
Can't think of anything.. But, you should do an Applejack with Blacklight.
?
Blacklight Something
Since Applejack is Applejack.
I think
And no, I'm not implying that. I'm just saying, Blacklight (Something else)
[04:43] Efreet: Can't think of anything.. But, you should do an Applejack with Blacklight.
I meant this ^
Four syllibles is a bit odd for a pony name IMO
a bit long
whatevs
He didn;t even specify WHICH applejack
not about to change it over that
oh
that's where Blacklight Gleaming came from
:P
Don;t change it in anything'
8mhm
Yeah, pretty much. You have a difficult name to convert, but it is also pretty gender-neutral.
Darkness' Radiance
(new suggestions)
thbpbpbpb
but another thing i got to watch.. is the mirai nikki anime whenever it happens
need cutiemark idea for a unicorn.
fffff-
just use a shortened version
Blacklight is usually taken, though
and then in any time you need to Pony RP
/me locates torrent for Lodoss
and I'm not about to Blacklight8241 or something
Drop the Pinkamena Diane, in other words. Just for fiction.
Just use Blacklight
Exactly Fall
Sign up as BlacklightShining, but just use the blacklight portion when RPing and such.
succinctly put
dropping the two Violets
Michael89pl: I wish
I do
I hid it on mars
when you finds it, Wow.
that leaves Darkblaze Gleaming, Darkness' Radiance, Jetblack Radiance, and Blacklight Gleaming
Phonetically, "Darkness' is very awkward.
(nine minutes)
And you don't have a single pomy who's name is possesive either
!s2
Maybe changing it to something like "Darkness Radiant."
Season 2 begins in 6d:01h:09m:05s
even then
Darkly Radiant?
It is a word that tends to reek of MarySue-dom
you say that—everything!
>:)
>:( *
How about just "Obsidian?"
blacklight shinging, sounding feminine
My name shall be...
nyus
That's nice
Lordlyhour sees no problems in thos
I wouldn't put a seconf word with "Obsidian," it's already four syllables.
Mason_Trowel seconds
Um, I meant to second Lordly's comment

Il y a quelqu'un?
I can't think of a cutiemark for myself .-.

I really like that
Lol
Hellew

If I make a character, I cannot unmake
Lordly, feeling a little alliterative today?
otherwise they walk ALL around my head, making dicks of themselves and asking me why Ineed to replace the,
Nah
And hmm
Just Paraphrasing Harry Potter
Peeves, specifically, when He was mocking Luna Lovegood
Hmm...now I really need to think up a design for Newton
...I am SUCH a nerd
Lordly: Harry potter is relatively mainstream.

Chose brown, since well.. My hair is a -deep- brown.
You could just call him Spiral.
A symbol like that makes me think he may enjoy researching symbols and runes
Well. I do like researching.
or hypnosis
A pony who's special talent is reading and researching on ancient symbols/runes.
They need one for those
Yes
Sure, the symbolic letters they use in the show are probably just to break the language barrier when taking the show to non-English countries, but still
Need a name for him. ffff-
Probably
But Spiral Horn is the one I have the guts to post
That may be too horn-ey
hah. Punny.
Hrm..
Bry Fireant
Eloszka.
Not sure if it fits with the talent
Spiral Rune?
That could work

I find the names hard to think of since they seem to relate to one's talent while remaining name-like

I need someone to battle me in the Polka-manz B/W
And then Phoe said "Gayest straight boyfriend ever"

Aww.
I know it's not real, but it's the thought that counts, right?\

*FIRES RANDOMLY*
Good show!
wat
That. is the single. best idea. ever.
Lordlyhour dances on the head of a pin
Lordlyhour said that, rather than did that
Don't think there's anything on the stream right now
Lordlyhour is now going to speak in Third person. Becauselordlyhour is awesome enough to pull it off
want my address?
I just thought of another punny pony. XD
:)
oh no....because then id actualy have to send you socks
:(
/me flips down sunglasses, while a guitar wails in the background. Because Lordlyhour just stoll all of its money. and its sunglasses
why are you teasing a poor girl?
Ha.
I'm on a school laptop right now.
because its fun
:D
I got to say, Magneto made the stream (puts sunglasses on) 20% cooler!!! http://yeahbutton.com/
but then i had a sad :(
Lol
Now these guys and a couple other of their frends want me to remove the junk to make the MBs much much more useful
If only there were five members in Friezas family
Because ponies
remove the junk!
you forgot the YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHH bit Kstrike lol
Because then it would have been 20% coola
I plan to capitalize on this, but if I do I have a decision to make
like when they filmed the kids undressing in their room at home
Capitalize? You mean charge for it?
Do I risk getting notorious and possibly lose my MB classes but make money?
Seriously, they should install adblock
the system is evil and fighting it is the morally right choice
I wouldn't try to make money off it. The school would be SERIOUSLY pissed.
I'll be charging them prolly 25 bucks for each unlock
Yeah, but I unlocked mine last year too
Definitely. EVERYONE would be pissed.
oh wait, I just pinged the mod...
yes?
oh
didn't mean to ping you
just passing by, have i missed something good?
*looks left to right suspicously*
It's not abnormal
/me snickers at the perils of having a real pony name....
I need to get a picture of the image of Cooler in the sun (from one of the DBZ movies) and give it the caption "This star is now 20% Cooler"
:(
LOL
...
Bahahahaha
I lol'd.
I remember that bit, Mason.
The amount of money you make won't matter. Not to a school committee mindset.
Umm...
Oh.
right.
also hai poni_
all the filthy, filthy.
...
Well, I'ma stop right there.
I need to run to the store quickly, I'll be back in 10-15 minutes
I can even pull it up right now...
ohokay. see you.
It's probably already in progress.
Stay safe RP!

But my bit isn't quoted
T.T
But unicorns aren't oppressed, nopony's trying to "cure" them or anything.
Nashy: maybe in a future they do...
lol :D
Definitely.
Nashy, it's not the unicorns. It's the Jewish unicorns that are oppressed.
...
in an alternate universe?
If only this were EaD
Unicorns are hated and feared for their magic!

He changed it when he entered Germaney
He felt that the name was too... weak for him

We need more official ponies
the lack of Ponies is making us all go loopy
I eat the standard meat fare. Cows, pigs, chickens, tuna, processed meat product with pepperoni seasoning.
!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/54695
meat is murder, etc
there
It won't be too long before we're killing each other, and using their cutiemarks for Blankets
just have to change everythign else now
hehe
http://bronydb.com/184
just have to change all my code lol
Well, I'm of the opinion that if it has already been murdered, I may as well make it useful.
8no silly
shoo shoo be doo
hey Synros THE mod
That is faulty logic.
8its Turgle...the doubter
/me shrugs
The more people buy meat, the more is produced.
8lol
:D
that is faulty logic, though I'm not vegetarian, that is stupid
The system is working, then.
yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM
I'm having a ton of fun on this /g thread
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Call Upon The Sea Ponies" - "One of my favourite songs of all time! &quot;Count Upon the Sea Ponies&quot; is from the My Little Pony special &quot;Firefly&#39;s Adventure.&quot;"
Thus by buying meat you are contributing to the killing of animals.
8i do
I never said the Cuitemark was detached, now did i?
(y)
I suppose I am.
BLEEDING BLANKET OF LEGS, OH YES
Oh, well.
Meat is awesome.
8EspyLcaopa please do not post such horid things
Shoo shoo be do
why fish-ponies?
why?
8scary s**t right there
Seconded
Eat meat if you must, but don't try to justify it with faulty logic.
I eat meat because it tastes good. I really don't need any more logic than that myself. I simply don't care if some animals have to get put down for it.
seriously though, i'm too lazy to be a vegetarian
Doesn't mean I'll stop eating meat, but to each his own.
but i'm too damn lazy to cook it
I hate vegetables is the REAL reason I could never be a vegetarian
or find easy recipies
I am extremely lazy.
uh
I like certain vegetbles
i like anime songs
But I;d never survive being a vegetarian
Amen to that Mason.
:/^ heart disease
But vegetarian food isn't harder to cook.
Just microwave some soy hotdogs or whatever.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Nz5mGKrB0&hd=1
watch anime and you'll find the songs that way lol
play games and you'll find songs that way:D
and lentil pies
heh
i really should become a vegetarian
i don't play and i don't watch anime :D
!moon
Grab my tail, Lordlyhours_CholestorlLevels!
still... could I really give up steak... probably, i don't really eat it that often anyway
Go watch Usagi Drop
^
You can cut down on meat.
I'll be back in a little while, I promised the budgie a bath.
usagi drop?
oook
It is only thanks to my incredible metabolism that I am only 136 lbs
Yes.
He's probably wondering when it'll happen.
i'll look for a torrent
i haven't seen usagi drop myself
See yiz.
8i prefer FMA as my anime of choose
To the moon with 'em aye?
it is surprisingly difficult being a vegatarian
A 5 year old daughter the rest of the family doesn't want to take care of.
especially colourful ponies :D:D
There's a lot of anime I like... very hard to choose a favorite
It's hard to be a vegetarian at restaurants.
I'm 200+ pounds. .-.
i'm 90 kilos
I weigh 65 kg
There is a massive amount of anime.
D_D
Nashy, yes, going out to eat is a pain
metric system ftw
I 70 Kg on this meat eater.
maybe Martian Successor Nadesico
and nashy.... 65kg also
...or Azumanga Daioh
not*
I MUST AWAY
5'6" tall, 136 lbs
Azumanga is awesome.
Yukari-mobile!
65-70? yall are tiny

whats that in kg
Pounds. Imperial weight measurement.
current favorite anime is One Piece

IT SAYS "LORDLY, LORDLY, COME TO ME. COME AND PLAY WITH THE PONIES!"
I really like Banner of the Stars, also
i can't find the torrent D:
o long, Lordly
*So
Hayfever: I cheat and eat meat sometimes. Mostly because if I eat out there's like 2 vegetarian options and I can't eat either of them.
eeeeyup
but remember I'm sexier
Oh, and Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi
What's the topic?
lordies
My brother attempted being Vegan. He said it was ricidulously difficult.

Sure is Hayfever.
Heeeeeeeeello everypony.

Certain writings can encourage someone to read more slowly without them realizing it though.
8inb4 to many people show up
How's it going?
I read fast and skip some words, brain fills them in.
I just reread if something wasn't clear.
Reading the tropes in depth, since they are written as though "in-character" it makes you want to read it "as the character"
Nashy: happens unintentionally for me sometimes, i guess the brain doesn't work the same for everyone
xD
Yeah, YMMV.
My brain is more machine-like than most.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yknRH8dRTBU

8wait IS, you have a seret basement thats..upstairs?
yep.
8ok...

...QuickTime
VLC
I prefer A.D. and B.C. though, I think it's silly to change it now...
something like that
VLC plays EVERYTHING.
can we please watch something else
my VLC doesn't like MKVs
Volume Liquidator Consumer.
mine does
No can do, Dash has taken over the stream
0^
I like VLC, Quicktime annoys me because for a site I frequent it makes a browser player and keeps me from easily downloading the files.
She won't stop until you're 100% seduced

:D
well it was more of a "hey" but still
eH?
**Eh?
>.>
She's "saying hi" to us right now, in fact...
with her eyes
uhhm ffdshow?
i bet
Isn't that a convertor?
LOL
.......... why Celestia why?
no its a... codecpackage
or something
it was akward
lol
8thats wat I did :p
it is
8oh
its the image
8:O
8RBD is best pony
^
agreed
:(
i had to use that one once with weird encoded mp4 files
gtg, cya everypony
no they dont nashy
I hadf that but I don't think it worked. Or I just don't know how to make them work
ffdshow is awesome though
ffdshow is basicly one codec that can playback anything
forget codecpacks, install VLC or smplayer
later brah
cya
nah i dont wanna make anyone jealous
you fantasised about Dash again, I take it
codecpacks are just a bunch of files that get installed to system32 and can't be uninstalled
8I'm sry I don't come with explosions, cars, and machine guns
flkkn lckhn:)
well just can just delete system32
they can be uninstalled
YEW NEED TO GO TWO DA MOON
i ahve all that
I haven't used codecpacks in years, ffdshow and VLC made them redundant
TUMBLR ON DUTY
i obce petted a rainbow dash once but it was expensive
once
youve been to equestria too?
EPIK
no hollis and queens
ooo
I've downloaded codecpacks but they didn't do anything. :<
i know QQ
she made me do things after it was scary
why can't i hold all these codecs?
Because they are not physical objects.
Oh another thing i should mention: drunk ponies are fuckiong hilarious!!!
lol
Nashy: unless you print them!
But then you're not holding the codec...
You're holding a printout of some representation of the data in it.
8what are you talkign about IS?
yep. she says she can handle it but i dont think she can
why can't i hold all these code?
I went to equestria remember?
:pokerface:
8oh
8right....
Why can
Why can't I hold all these?
yep
sry i meant to say RD
I want one of these http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTRKmjVUWY&feature=related

MIne seems a lot safer than that 0_0

Here's the prologue: http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d492spz
LUNA
Then part 1: http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d49a3n2
in case anyone has patience to skim through it, lol
make him fall for luna please
lol
everypony falls for luna
yes
ok
which of the mane 6
k luna ftw
*RBD
MAGIC
lol
read the prologue, it explains it: http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/#/d492spz
phew
makes more sense to the ponies now
yeah.
he doesnt know how he got there and the ponies never heard of humans before
which one do u think he should stay with and why?
duuh
Pinkie Pie
2- he is totally different from everything
3- she breaks the fourth wall more often than not
obv pinkie pie
but quite honestly
i was thinking either Twilight because she brought him into town, or applejack because she's the most down-to-earth pony of the group.
you should just put him to whoever you think is the best
IMO the most logical would be twilight
(fluttershy is too quiet, rainbow dash lives in the sky, rarity...well... idk.)
rarity would consider him ugly-as-hell
=p
and it goes further to cloppy things...
hugh
nice fic
/me taps Curly on the sholder and runs away
theres the whole song for you guys
is anyone else still here?
07oui
iyes
6hyes~
07yes
kinda
Kinda still here.
How would you handle an invasion of humans with modern weaponry? how would you defeat us? haha
Nuke at them = right back at us
: /
07nope
Nopony*
Hand to hand combat, they'd definitely have it over anyone not specially trained. There's a reason people say a hard hit was like getting kicked by a horse
ponies are horses
yeah we have knives and bayonets too
I suppose unicorns could handle weapons, holding them with magic, but it would probably be awkward handling.
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/memes-oshi1.jpg
Let's face it.
We'd lose because ponies are too cute to kill.
obv
why use weapons if you have magic in the first place?
07One magic to rule you all
07waaaaaait
07One magic-spell to rule you all
horn power
My fan-fic isn't going to have conflict between humans and ponies
07nahhhh
07I don't need rings
07I have magic
Because magic is stronger
lol Claymore Pony would be badass]
http://i.imgur.com/CtoOa.jpg
pure magic
altho its been like 7 months since I last read Claymore...
They'd need some battle Ponies to protect the casting Unicorns. :0
ohay
lol
:D
LOL
now THAT is awesome
well
yeah
its not really easy to be "stealth"
lol
I thought he was trapped
heh
:P
this is going to be boss
brb guys
Rarity IS Industry xD
gotta listen to that

07tell me in PM
why not link Fluttershy's stream
Stream at the Bronystate.net?
rather than streamception it?
07nah we like to bring her in :)
We're just trying to get something to work
07ohai flutterbro
or make her get rights to bronystate's stream or something
cuz streamception creates a huge delay

07poor Payne
Oh that's the one thing which is wrong with me
yes, thank you
/me hugs WhatPayne~
That doesn't sound fun
Yes. I can tell you they are the worst.
Best thing about migraine is when it goes away it feels like you have been born again.
I don't get migraines, I just get really bad headaches.
0wiw
0wow that was painful
0What do you use?
Uh, I have two medicines.

MFW I have no health thing.
Yeah I guess I have that one health thing too...
I have, umm, one sec lemme think
5 health things? Nah, more than that
All I know is I take 12 pills a day for assorted things.
And damn herospirit
I really have no health problems.
streamception is coming
...
Literally none.
O_o
was just trying to see if something worked first
how come you don't have health problems?
Meh, I'm not depressed, I just sometimes feel a bit down most likely due to my age.
Ouch, I'm sorry to hear that, herospirit
Dooo eeet
Aw, why not, Fluttershy?
They gave me radiation to kill my thyroid to fix it. Thyroid's growing back though, which probably shouldn't be happening. : /
:P
sorry?

aw, you shouldn't be ashamed, Fluttershy
Seriously, it'll probably be the best rendition of Sea Ponies evar
I didnt
[20:36] Meh, I'm not depressed, I just sometimes feel a bit down most likely due to my age.

Oh.
Then no.
I couldn't leave my family behind and just forget them.
Hmm, well this COULD be after Rainbow Dash saves everyone and gives them the choice
...I don't remember the third movie all that well :P
They made sequels to The Matrix? *hit*
Thunder_Dash: No they didn;t.
The matrix has no sequels.
2,14 for once, I agree with dari
Actuall
y
Second movie was great :P
Prefered the animartix to the movies.
I've only actually seen the first one, I just couldn't help but make that joke :P
....I can't get the shoo be doo song out of my head.
I take it you never saw it.
"Why can he use his powers in the real world"
Espy; SHOO BE DOO SHOOP SHOO BE DOO
"His powers extend beyond the matrix"
FJAPOKFAWEOPKF
2,14 MAGIC
They just couldn't come up with anything good.
I only ever watched the first movie.
I still think that the real world was a matrix too.
2,14 and they're just like "oh fuck"
Well they didn't really extend beyond the Matrix, he could just still hack into it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h5YmbhpI5c
I saw all the Animatrix shorts
Some were really good, others were pretty "meh"
"EVERYTHING IS A DOLLAR"

bye mib_28xl5a
/me has paid-for mIRC, likes it.
Yes, I paid for my mIRC
11'cause I can't use color text on mIRC
You PAID for mIRC?
Wow.
11or at least I don't know.
Weird.
11No, I didn't.
do you like bananas?
11oh.
I sure like bananas
But...No one pays for mIRC. :P
XChat I've heard good things about.
/me shrugs
Oh wait, maybe it isn't...
11I wish Mibbit would make their IRC usable off of websites...
11Xchat?
fluttershrug
mibbit is a web-client
Yeah, most peopel seem to use Xchat now.
people*
11Chatzilla's kinda popular too.
http://xchat.org/
/me uses KVIrc.
/me 11has only been using mIRC.
11That's all I've EVER used.
^
I've used bersirc, trillian, and pidgin before, too.
It handles all kinds of messaging clients including IRC
Here's a list of IRC clients: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison%5Fof%5FIRC%5Fclients
11XChat looks like an even Simpler version of mIRC.
I used to use BitchX, but it got really awkward when people saw the shortcut :P
11But would it let me post in color text like I'm doing now?
Not very hard. XD
11Coming from the code guru.
11No thanks.
Pretty sure you can use color codes in XChat just like in mIRC... I don't do it, though
11oh? how do I do color codes?
You can write a simple script to add color, otherwise.
How do I shot colour?
Ctrl + k
Can i shot you to the moon?
11HOLY SHIT IT WORKS!
Lawl
/me 11can use mIRC now. :D
Good.
:D
/me converts everyone to mIRC
WHOO! \o/
mIRC is for tomatoes
3Uh-oh, now I'm stuck using color :/
lol don't do that, or you'll be kicked :P
Nvm, fixed…I think...
11 Any Way to make this permanent? or do I just keep puting that code in?
I can give you a script for it.
11That'd be cool....but how do i put the script on mIRC? XD
Script ediot.
Look at the buttons along the top/side of mIRC.
11oh, I see it.
Hi Barry
11Awesome.
editor*
Hi Lord Celestia.
Colors are overrated anyway
Seems the author of On A Cross And Arrow is considering a sequel
are you a faithful subject?
to me*
well, i can offer you some bananas
lmao
imo
I agree.
/me 11googles for the script rather than waiting on Dari. :P
Pfft.
Script written by me is 20% cooler.
:P
But actually
CBA to pastebin.
11CBA?
Everyone is here a week early
I'm OK with this
lol
haha
well, not actually
but its fun saying MOOOOONNNNAH beeyetch
That may distract her :P
Wait. A sequel to On a Cross and an arrow?
It can be loaded into the Alias section of mIRC
lol
>alias
Lawl fail
and he doesnt care, lol
That's an IRCop.
:P
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat_operator
and IRC means "something relay chat"?
oh that answers it haha
11Hmm.
Alright it all makes sense now
lol
11The script is saved as a .txt file.
.txt is fine.
I like txt files.
Just copy/paste it :P
Operator 101: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/opguide.html
Also that script is a fail.
Because it's an alias.

it still says offline
POOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
how are you all seeing this?
http://www.dinkypage.com/bronystate-theaterlq
07nope
refresh the stream
07bronystate.net/theatre
oh moved again.
Yeah, normal stream has improved.
it says offline for high quality
OOH
9okay, I guess I'll be the one doing the talking
10MrChang you gotta refresh the whole page, not just the stream
Try refreshing the page.
Oh, i totally was digging through email
it's a little laggy for me for whatever reason
I'm lagging a bit, but I assumed it was due to my brother playing 360
9anyways, we wish to hold a pretty hefty event
Alright
GENTLEMEN
and celestia
9you already know of our famous movie nights, which take place on Fridays
*cough*
yep
>Lord
Right.
uhh
9since the premiere is next Saturday, this was our plan:
it still says offline for high quality
wahh
5by5 here
I missed whatever you streamed though
yep/
you...look...delicious
9Stream the movies from the movie night, then commence an overnight marathon of Season 1
GEMS
9Seth, I think you're in the wrong page LOL
yah, it lags for me.
9http://bronystate.net/theatre/
9there
9check that player out
high quality still says offline
/me refreshes
9for a sample of our actual stream quality
And as far as I've seen no one else has complained of any?
There we go, works for me~
07nope
/me 10is now in modchat
hmm, let me mess with scripts
but high quality says offline for me
Aww, Hero_Spirit.
there is no HQ atm
/me had one hesitation that lasted a few seconds.
6 but aside from that it is fine~
then again if this is LQ i dont think I could handle HQ
Hiya!
Alright
Why are you guys here if there's no stream?
There is a stream.
9well, here comes the pitch:
07there is a stream
RAPEEEE
10Swafft_fromlivestream there should be a stream. Refresh the page?
Hello SpaceBob.
NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
9we saw how Bronyville cooperated with you for their S1 marathon recently
6SPIIIIKE! ugh, dirt. . . AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
9but yeah
yep
hmm, we were planning that for a few months with them really. Brontville and EQD is really close
bronyville^
can you guys say something?
/me is watching fullscreen and enjoying it
I'm at my wits end
I guess just toss the copypaste and I can roll with it, his was huge because he had like 30 awards hah
the banner helped, but the way it was run was really built around making it exciting
It goes a bit fuzzy in fullscreen, but otherwise it's nice.
everyone is sort of burnt out
shes such a bad actor
lol
9Hero_Spirit, you probably should watch the Low Quality stream when it's set up
9dari
07Well it's not just a marathon, it's a full show
9I'm not streaming at epic HQ
07followed by the season 2 kick off
10natelyn it's not really built for full screen at the moment, this is standard quality for the standard window
Are you doing a podcast thing for it then?
Rarity be the best pony
they cant imagine rarity getting raped
its a kids show!
10wat do
what's prison
>Spike has pockets
who's prison?
OMG
[02:29] <Seth> Are you doing a podcast thing for it then?
how does Spike anticipate that the dogs have dogs?
MANLY SPIKE
Spike is pants
Podcast.
Gaaaaaaaaaaah.
I've seen it before, its defenitly good enough!
@manlymeter Spike
9oh, we kind of....
9improved it, you see

But back to the event
9ah, I see
are you just streaming episodes?
Pinkie! <3
9no, no
WEEEEEE!
Or are you doing a full on invite people/interview/podcast/livestream thing?
OMG look at pinkie lmao
9we're streaming two movies first (Brony Movie Night)
9that leads to the S1 episodes
Shit.
10a podcast which is seperate to our usual schedule?
9which in turn leads to the S2 premiere
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
6NNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
that made my day!
WE MUST TELL NO ONE
inb4intothebestnightofyourlife
anyone Mastur CHeef?
07RBD did you read about the marathon?
9which in turn leads to assorted non-pony show
omg.
omg guise
9which in turn leads to a rerun of last night's movie night
Wait, those gems are barely buried
HORSE PUSSY
9...which in turn leads to more non-pony material...which in turn leads to the rerun of the S2 premiere
^Shush!.
07Well.. i'm not sure about the partnership with the bronyshow.. a podcast might hurt our relationship with them
It doesnt make a bit of difference guys, Rarity's gone remember?
THe BALLS ARE INERT
9*ignore the the
>w>
theyre fucking dogs they should dig it
<3 Rarity
i was hoping there would be more bowie references in this episode.
9it's kind of a pre-marathon and post-marathon thing, I'd say
9the stream might be live for....
yep
6Okay. . .
6Seems he wants special things. . .
lol
07yep
Bronyville was a special case
not even "how could we get through this labyrinth of tunnels?"
inb4whining
6Maybe this is when we could showcase our guess that tune idea?
6And DA competitions?
a plain marathon is something a lot of people have been doing all summer
10or I don't think he'll comit
10commit*
Well yes
a lot of them don't have any interest in house, or older movies. I can see the swarms coming in for season 2 though
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
6What we do is pitch these things included in it
9well, we have been thinking of making a podcast as well, but we wouldn't have it prepared for the event
WHINING. <3
9hmmm...that said, we'd be elaborating a schedule for the event....do you think it could be visible in EqD?
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHINING
we might as well cut our losses
Well.
ANYTHING?
let's just have him display our schedule
Clearly we need to get on a podcast.
Yah I can post it up
same as always
10idd
Suddenly, she enslaves her slavers
>same as always
Meh.
Right?
I agree
Only works if you're shorter than three feet. :<
07I want to ask if other people / communities informed him about streaming season 2
10xD
;~;
woopwoopwoop
Hmm.
;O
do it.
that said
/me hugs Rarity "You're not ugly!"
Then he's all like "DAMN STRAIGHT BITCH"
He just smacked my favorite Pony's flank
Yah, as long as it's not too tall
I'll try to get us the most exposure possible
9roger that?
9*!
6.-. Did. . . no one see my suggestions. . ?
Ill tell you where they can't smack Rarity
07Seth, i'm just curious did any other communities inform you about themselves streaming Season 2?
ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAH
BEE-YETCH
BEEEYEEETCHES
Vio
RIDE
we can't prepare those things in a week
woop
fuck em up
fuck em down
no set communities, just random people on livestream/justintv
haha is that a regular show ref?
6Done before.
but if you can handle the traffic i'll send people here instead
are there gems on the moon?
These Dogs go down like bitches
I can tell you
Hiya Suffuri!
people barely, if ever, stick for drawing streams
we might as well stream a marathon of House
yes, but I'm going to try to ask him something
07ok
allo.
07i'll wait
give me a moment
Hmm
6People stick around for Fluttershy's streamception. . .
... people really seem opposed to free shit this week.
It seems to be askign a bit much.
07they do yes
Good thing they're not Lannisters.
asking*
damn lannisters
9will you be linking to streams using that method?
Goddamn Joffrey.
oh come on lethim finish that one
I could!
9as in, to posts advertising S2 streams, I mean
>i agree
PLAY ANOTHER :D
play the one with luna
(episode 2)
play episode 2 please
9well if you could link to our stream post with that, it'd be pretty rad O:
there
my favs
Now which one?
that's the most we can possibly get out of him...and frankly I believe that's pretty good.
and tyrion
:D
/me hugs Luna
Yeah.
07yea.. but we do need to look at our show... we lack communication with our community
/me gobbles
hmmm

I choose option 3

9well, the problem with synchtube, in my opinion as a seasoned streamer, is that it's just a stream, and not a LIVE stream
ME GUSTA
07live-stream > synchtube
I am disgraced that they even exist in my kingdom
yah

13Ahhhh
KanyeNorthEast: And mouths.
13That was one CRAZY night
thats another thing, if they were going to have a episode called "call of the cutie" you'd think there'd be ONE lovecraft reference
that would be me : D
KanyeNorthEast, a Lovecraft reference in Ponies would have made my night. No, my week.
Lol, how do i change my name?

07Feel free to apply to the team :)
Eheheh, I'll let you have it. :P
i cant stream =\
i've only 2 gb RAM
13Seth thinks its a good idea too probably. A good podcast really brings people in sometimes. :P
Feh the Hub guide says the same as my cable guide luna.
and i don't have cable anymore
07I lost count KanyeNorthEast
Enough to populate Equestria.
13Also, I dunno if I should feel bad or not, buuutttt...

13Oof!
how do you post a thumbnail for URLs
/me 13is tackled

I've never been fond of CrossBreeze as a mod for example. :P
13Me either.
07Well.. they way he got in.. was a little strange
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HePTmrV-og that's going to be me when season 2 ep 1 begins

13I hardly even see him around it seems...
07I added the vid to our playlist

thats going to be my expression when s2 begins
/me never voted yes on CrossBreeze :P
13AH!
/me 13is glomped by Decap
you're going to be 4 Filipino men?

: D
you gotta watch the shouting
the real part of that vid
they sure take their beauty pageants seriously over there
skip to 2:27 lol
do you just post the link?
And I can't tell if anything is on right now...
nothing is on
07nothing is on atm :)
13Ah, was wondering why my stream was perpetually loading.. lol

07oh?
Kanye: Same

GRETA
13Great news everyone! /professors voice

I got a paying job at a haunted house
07Ohhh!
13Sounds fun.
can it, eddie murphy
07post pics of Pinkie if you see her!
07She likes to roam around there I heard!
Perhaps we should just... Oh, that is... great. I guess. IN a paying way. \
/me 13now has the idea of going as Pinkamena for Halloween
I don't want to actually load up the episodes, but... whatever. </lazy>
'Tavi: DO EET
13;)
it does have one of the greatest B-movie lines ever, Kanye.
world domination?
Of course!
no...
Hey guys I'm back for a little bit
or do you mean "for me it was tuesday"?
http://images.cosplay.com/photos/12/1291975.jpg'
"For me... it was Yueday."
look at that beauty, luna
Tueday-- argh.
Hey guys I have something to show you: http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/Lord-Celestia-257993873
Face it- most colts look like fillies anyhow.
:D
and he looks very, very young
otherwise i'll just stand back here not blinking
?
hes too tall
he looks like a female..
the male ponies have very specifically shaped heads
His body is female >.>
http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/228/a/a/metal_gear_woona_boss_fight_by_egophiliac-d46qxbw.png
and her husband would look more of celestia's age
he looks like her teenage son
That's usually where the difference is.
The bodies are generally the same i thought?
Also HHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGG
yeahhhhhhhhh no
Teenage Celestia's son. Fic in there somewhere...
Colts and Stallions have thicker bodies.
It's really minor, but it makes all the difference.
Be right back then...
07http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/253/1/8/luna_the_bunny_by_europamaxima-d49grvf.jpg

07don't share with anyone!
Luna: D'awwww
07You won't see me in it again EVER!
Luna you look like you are ready to kill some one.
13Dat Luna in a rabbit costume <3

Be polite to the Mistress of the Moon. Or I might start biting.
'Tavi bites :3
It has a +9 strength enchantement :3

the one movie I desperately want to see streamed is kung fu hustle
hardly anyone i've talked to has ever seen it
>_>
Fine.
I'll go get my Cuirass of Strength +17.
07Mmmm...

/me takes notes

IT'S A GAZEBO!
100sided die
I AM THE DUNGEON MASTER!!!!
... I actually rolled a 20
>what
you don't have a 100 sided die?
why..?
It's not used in most games.
derp
/me only rolls his eyes. Even raised by ponies, sometimes he doesn't get them...
I prefer to use the cluexfour.
Kanye: Best be trollin'
But I know you are. ^_^
At least you have some common instincts... grrrr.
No, not that many
Only 1 or 2
uchiha..
are you referencing naruto?
I am back and KANYENORTHEAST DID YOU SAY KUNG FU HUSTLE.
yes, common mary sue tropes
yeah, kung fu hustle is awesome
KUNG FU HUSTLE IS AMAZING
-brohoof-
kung fu hustle is made by my people.
/me brohoofs Kanye and Nat
you're welcome, everypony
i wish I could find more people around me who've even heard of it
Guys, I fixed my picture
Have you seen Kung Pow?
Luna, I swear, i don't really like bunnies all that much. (however, I DID give you that pair of socks...)
/me brohoofs Hero_Spirit
it more acturately captures my manlyness
http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/Lord-Celestia-257993873
of course i've seen kung pow, its also amazing
:D
Lord: Now you've got it
oooohhh
change his color scheme and hair
Maybe a little TOO manly
:p
If he wasn't a douche and was built out
you can never be too manly
and extend his face.
Luna! <3
07SILVERMANE!
Luna!
/me is angry
no
And my work is done here.....
you can make him manly
give him a beard
its just relatively obscure
Hey, Luna! I've taken a picture to capture my manliness
http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/Lord-Celestia-257993873
Um... Luna...? >3>;
fair enough
/me hugs Fluttershy
extend his face too, it's disproportionate to his body
Has anyone here seen "Murder by Death"?
Fluttershy, RUN
Extend... his face?
/me is hugged, squeaks. "B-But I can't move... I'm being hugged!"
i dont think i had that option
GROUP HUG AROUND FLUTTERSHY EVERYPONY
Okay, time to sleep soon
you gotta extend it
/me hugs Fluttershy too
/me releases Fluttershy
/me hugs fluttershy again

/me gently hugs Fluttershy
how are you guys doing that anyway? is it /me or something?

GROOUP HUG AROUND FLUTTERSHY

/me group hugs
/me is amazing
/me is bombarded by hugs. "Ahhhhh!!! Silvermane I---blaraghgh...."
LUNA
oh hey, it works
/me rescues Fluttershy
He wouldnt be celestia without the long hair
and i dont have the option of longer face and horn
/me leaves
or mr.celestia, the husband
Yes.. the msne must needs be long...
/me sighs relieved
we should ask him if he still wants to mod for us
e-e; OUUUUUUCHHHHH stop pricking meee! ><
OH NOES.
/me Heals fluttershy with magic
07We already did
+50
I haven't really seen that but i've seen Clue
/me rolls 20 on dodge check
the movie based on the boardgame
HA HA
Luna Luna Luna Luna~
Take a message please
If I remember right Clue was a great movie
/me sighs... and howls at Luna, just because. It's the right thing to do.
/me goes back to eating popcorn.
OOH MEE MEEEEE
/me jumps around excitedly
07Fluttershy?
Fight Club would make a good A movie too
though i'm sure everypony has seen it already...
13Has he even been around lately?
If we were gonna watch a clue like movie how about we just watch Clue.
... with... anything
?
/me prepares canon
Good 'cause you about to go bananas
ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAH
OH NO
/me bounces popcorn off the protective shell.
BEEEEYEEEETTCCHHH!
/me is 100% moon.
*Maniacal laughter
/me blinks, then smiles at Luna. "Thanks!" Fluttershy then proceeds to hug Luna.
/me stares at the screen. This spinning circular thing is getting interesting.
Aw, more group hugs!
/me rushes over and squeezes both Luna and Fluttershy
come on everypony
hugs :D
that's how I say hellow.
/me "Ummmmmm"
hi
HEEEELLLLLOOOOOWWWWWWW.
you're a bum and you fight like an ape
seeing apes are 10 times stronger than humans
I can't stop listening to the Italian theme.
that is fairly good
"I like bananas." >>
Oh you do?
Would you like to find out where else you can find bananas?
/me hugs Fluttershy whispering: "your welcome dear"
ill tell you other places to find bananas
>> um....
would you like to know?
Wait, Celestia, are you actually Italian? Not just a name?
yeah^
Can you translate that theme sometime? :3

It's not on the moon, certainly.

pretty much lol
07How far did you get on the forums?
I see, someone linked me from eqd
more background ponies, more songs
http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pokmon-you-may-have-to-use-burn-heal-otherwise.jpg
I got most of the interviews done.
HAAH.
I got to say, Tacowiz...lol
Should be more users soon. We're changing names.
And I'm adding content. Whoo....
GUISE, DECISION TIME, and I need yer help
07well please vote on the applications if possible
which one?

No, no.
ok
Nothing published yet.
Then write away! write till you're competing with past sins
Is that part of the move to bronychan.net?
ERGH
Lol no.
xD
bronychan doesn't exist.
:p
DAMNIT RHPS
It was a typo.
hm, hopefully its magic technology or steampunk
and a step to the right
Decision: keep this oversaturated color and get this-
steampunk = automatically 20% cooler
Don't you stat Kanye. :I
issue, even.
Hero_Spirit: You doing the TIME WARP AGAIN?
Starting on the Twilight set of cursors.
Hot Patootie right now. :0
Ooh, very nice Nat.
Best be letting me know when it's done. :p
Luna's done. -.-
4 freaking loading cursors.
07I heard my name
Last one seemed kinda crappy, but it looks... nice in execution.
07show me
Uhh. I'll make a temporary dropbox link. Hold on
Haha whoops
/me loves dropboxes
=3
hi
07Oui
Hello
Zat is correct
Which version?
Madam
07Zat is correct monsieur
7 or XP?
077
Alrighty-o.
Wtf
Hello sai
err
'course.

/me thinks no-pony understood her reference
sadly I don't get it
Seems familiar Luna

07inb4 spaceeeee
helo rt
Linky linkaroo: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20458213/Luna%27s%20CS%20Themed%20Cursors.zip
It lets you set cursors from the right click context menu.
hello
07how does it work?
07can I get a preview?
The change cursor?
lol
07ah I see :)
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20458213/untitled.PNG
I'm still using XP.
07:D
Welcome to 2002
I have 7 on my netbook.
07Ohhh you use a netbook too?
07awesome!
I have a netbook that I got while in college and a laptop.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU~
Wait .4 like 400 mb?
07whats wrong dash?
Yeah, about.
07dash is out now ;)
07relog
They're all labeled in whatever position I use them in
Should I use the v2 versions?
Standard is the normal cursor, vert. resize is the vertical resize...
All versions have the same quality, it's just whichever you want to use.
Text select v2's click-area thingy is in the middle of the middle line, though.
4 minutes. I was right with my first guess.
Loading cursors, yeah.
And IMO, the moon in loading v1 is horrid.
Did you make the cursor the moon going through all its phases? that would be cool
the loading cursor I mean
Try it out o.o
Some websites use it, though.
I didn't make a handwriting. Nopony I know has ever seen it.
haha, cromartie high + my little pony
or would that be cromaretie high?
This cursor is nice. :0

That's kind of a suggestive name :I
just whatever + eastern time
12 pm for you
2,14 sorry, was a little tied up
but you should get on at 6 am for the stream
2,14 the Stream for S2 Ep1 starts at 6:00 AM PST
WHAAAAAAA
that is very early
Not really
then you'd have all saturday to anticipate it. instead you get to wake up early to ponies
2,14 best way to start the day :P
2,14 or you could just not go to sleep, and join us for our S1 stream :P
and then follow the fandom and its explosion the rest of the day
sleep is for the weak!

I am not sure if that is real or not.
yeah had a fealing it was something like that KanyeNorthEast
07Wow
/me drops a needle
personally I give it 3-4 seasons before they figure they should cash in and make a movie.
and then its all down hill from there
Movie could be good.
