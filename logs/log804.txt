i wish i could watch it... is it the same as Fryday movie night?
05,15otakon there's always saturday
04There is always Saturday...
04But you know...
04Yesterday was Thursday, Thursday
I have to work 5 to 9 tomorrow
05,15Yesterday was Thursday Thurdsay
05,15otakon that sucks
04I don't want this weekend to eeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEND
EMN is 7pm GMT I think.
On Saturday^
ok thanks
05,15you can't play any 90s fps without circle strafing
04Strafing's real easy! Ya just step to the side :D
05,15well yeah, but how do you move sideways!
05,15the arrows turn you!
04Step to the side, silly goose :3
05,15djblazekin I think that's just the console version
05,15and no mouse
Oh, sorry.
:(
you have to goe into setup
The first attempt is edible, but not very flavorful. Also, the texture left something to be desired.
sometimes strafe in those games is 'Q' and 'E' or even pressing another button in addition to 'A' and 'D'
Also may mix in some gorgonzola for extra flavor.
how can i send a message to someone???
It should autocomplete.
Oh.....
sillieh you
04WHAT IF
:3
04KEANU REEVES

One of them's in college. :D
Only kids I buy for are nieces and nephews
I dont like kids
I like kids well enough, but I don't think I'd be a good parent
not yet at least
Hubby doesn't like kids. XP
He no wanty at all.
Renting kids should be invented.
its called baby sitting and you get paid for it
Also foster parenting
That kinda counts as renting kids
I dont know how exactly it works, but I've never heard anything positive about it.
That means nothing. =P
hehe
i still act like a child sometimes is that bad?
not necessarily
I still do sometimes.
Sometimes to make my hubby laugh, sometimes to make him roll his eyes at me. =P
lol at work me and my work sis act liek 7 year olds sorta xD

yeah, well, it is a kids show...ment to sell toys....you would think from looking at the derpy brushies going for 100 bucks they would go....hmmm well, screw them!

yeah. the one that actually wrote her and liked her
i don't even see difference how it more or less offends somebody
There was no emotion in it at all
i don't get why they even need to change it
it's just stupid
are we talking about why they changed derpy's voice and slightly underped her eyes?
Last night I had a dream where an animated girl spoke entirelly in that iTunes edit voice.
the change was neccessary
There was no fucking emotion in that edit
I mean dont get me wrong I hate the edit too.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdVrOz379AI
oh dear\
She's not cute without the derp eyes.
Unfortunatley Soccer Moms seem to think everything offends people
hey hey hey stay out of my shed !
They just made it more frustraiting for community and character understanding.
hello once again
and Applebloom isn't as cute without the bow.

I think at this point Claire IS doing it on purpose.
In fact in the report on that I swore I saw a kid playing fucking Halo

Well I have bad news, truly bad news.
Let's ask Claire to come up with one.
maybe Wh~at! (~squeek)
HA
yes, ha.
why not?
it was a Elementary School
....and the other 8 just collapsed by themselves?
why not?
WHY FUCKING NOT?
I hope you burn
HOW FUCKED UP ARE YOU?
meh
because this this isnt 4 chan. talk about this somewhere else
Get out of here you twat.
I never understand why these people do these shootings
why
WHY
wait, you actually think civilians aren't killed in wars?
no

Wow... how insensitive can you be?
something about a nutter and a school
seriously listening to a live report of it
havent heard about it
http://www.breakingnews.com/
ouch
i think i am going to have a concussion by the end of the day
at least 20 down
thats sad
from all the head-desking
Unless one of you has a time machine there's really no point in discussing this.
no's gonna care about this in 2 weeks
they are ALREADY talking about gun laws, gun regulations, disarming everyone, etc
I point to Norway
Wow...fucking insensitive much?
eh, it's just the flavor of the day
well, probably the family of the deceased
let me put it this way
i could say the same thing about you gettin riled up
if guns are outlawed, the only people that are going to have guns, are criminals, and I seriously doubt criminals are going to be conserned that they are breaking gun laws
yeah agreed
all of them
and never make them again
really?
well why not?
can we drop this, it's geting boring now.
no guns seems to work for a lot of countries
Oryou know...get fucking security?
And this is fucking America, you expect for someone to not have a gun?
those countries have a vastly different culture than the US/Canada
bite me
a fucking 8 year old and 11 year old HELD UP A WOMAN IN A FUCKING CHURCH PARKINGLOT
saying anti gun laws in the UK or Japan works doesnt mean we should try it in the US
You could at least care you know
Why should we?
not really
i dont
Guns do not kill people
Nuh uh
people with guns kill people
^
they are just a tool to facilitate the process
gunpowder does
actually more direct, PEOPLE kill people
a gun is really a tool
Guns arent the issue, its people using the damn guns
people can kill people just fine WITHOUT guns
that's right
