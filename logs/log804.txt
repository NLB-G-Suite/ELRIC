it’s a prequel
Oh, i never watched LotR O___o

Do I need to watch LOtR first?
Or rewatch it
Didnt really care for it :\
havent watched them for years
well i don’t think so
You don't NEED to, but it's recommended.
i think that i have seen also a "b" movie with the same title :p
hmm
i will when im not in college
Buytoast: PREQUEL :|
actually the hobbit was written before LotR
05,15newfoals don't know bout my Hobbit
still, its a pre-requirement of being an internet peson
I watched bits and pieces here, but it didnt really interest me all that much.
I read the book
RaveBrony: That's understandable.
like watching star wars/trek, or watching MLP
stop trolling fluttercry
fluttercry: i do....

Jmo: djblazekins. they do weird shit with your mind
Then why are you saying random shit that doesn't make sense.
Dark92Enigma: how dare you censor uck, uck is one of the gods!
Is that u talking Wrek?
Shizuka: no mIRC love?
05,15mIRC works for me
If fluttershy had a dentistry, would it be FlutterSmile?
Irony
I'm thinking its Sumica cus Sumica is the only one who talks out loud.
/me gets into a C-130 and flies around
rehpaahrs
05,15I think for the most part we've all talked on stream at least once
Jmo: just joking at the fact there were two fluttercry 's....one with red / white text, other one with dual blue text.......DUH?
If I dont find whether its Wrek or Sumica talking it's gonna bother me all night.
fluttercry: minus Shizuka
^
/me runs out of fuel
Horrible.
if fluttershy was leader of a national socialistic government, would it be flutterhe... no im not doing that
AWW

TheGentleManBrony: I think it's both of them.

Ghosties looks like the answer is yes. hehehe.
05,15I mean....I guess there's soy bacon. But they wouldn't know what it tasted like to make the imitation bacon
04Bocon would never stand for someone eating more bocon than him D:

0,5Kekeke
BaconMane, I like that better.
BaconMane: those are my school's colors...

fluttercry: D:
I HATE MISSING BMN
otakon: WHAT? :O
i wish i could watch it... is it the same as Fryday movie night?
05,15otakon there's always saturday
04There is always Saturday...
05,15Sceptileknight that is Friday Movie Night
04But you know...
fluttercry: I have to work 3 to 9
04There's also...always Friday
04Yesterday was Thursday, Thursday
I have to work 5 to 9 tomorrow
05,15Yesterday was Thursday Thurdsay
04Taday it is Friday
so when is brony movie night?
been trying to get my mlg pro citrcut xb360 controller to work well with duke nukem 3d atomic edition
my boss KNEW I WANTED to have Friday night and Saturday morning off
04Tomorrow is Saturday, and Sunday afterwards...
05,15otakon that sucks
Sceptileknight: tomorrow, 7 pm EST
04I don't want this weekend to eeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEND
Sceptileknight Friday night, 7pm EST.
EMN is 7pm GMT I think.
On Saturday^
05,15I'm trying to figure out how to strafe in Duke Nukem 3D. If the arrows turn me, and the ctrl button shoots.....how do I move side to side
ok thanks
05,15you can't play any 90s fps without circle strafing
Anyone play portal 2?
04Strafing's real easy! Ya just step to the side :D
fluttercry: Is it not set up to use WASD as the controls?
04Silly flutter
Sceptileknight: i wish i had it
05,15well yeah, but how do you move sideways!
05,15the arrows turn you!
fluttercry: they release the source code for duke 3d a while back, if you want strafing look up one of the custom engines made for it.
is there virtical aim on the pc version or is it only on the console version
04Step to the side, silly goose :3
Fl00t4sh41, A or D
05,15djblazekin I think that's just the console version
05,15DocSane WASD is relatively new. FPS used to use arrows
05,15and no mouse
fluttercry: http://eduke32.com/
Oh, sorry.
fluttercry: Can't you just open the options menu and see what strafe is set for?
Kandarihu: What are you sorry for? :)
:(
I am making a second attempt at makign a bean loaf tonight.
DocSane: Best of luck! :)
you have to goe into setup
AJIsAwesome, giving fluttercry basic instructions for a game that DN3D predates.
And minecraft?
Kandarihu: Ah, I see.
04Oh Richard Cheese, y u so gud
The first attempt is edible, but not very flavorful. Also, the texture left something to be desired.
Ghosties: Becuase his last name is Cheese?
sometimes strafe in those games is 'Q' and 'E' or even pressing another button in addition to 'A' and 'D'
I've added in celery and mushroom to this one. First attempt just used carrots and onions.
04His cover of Black's Friday is great, and his cover of Just Like Heaven is even better
thelonepony: thats bad
there is now a hello kitty build a bear and chia pet
Also may mix in some gorgonzola for extra flavor.
Sceptileknight: i know, i do love puzzles, but yeah
how can i send a message to someone???
Sceptileknight: Type part of their name and push tab. :)
It should autocomplete.
thelonepony: thanks
i think he means private message
Sceptileknight Pm or just ping?
Oh.....
Then disreagrd what I said. :$
Sceptileknight: it was ayejay, not me
sillieh you
04WHAT IF
:3
04KEANU REEVES
04WAS A CAT
the ping thing that sound when you send me a message
fluttercry: oh my
Ghosties: :O
Sceptileknight: eeyup, you're new here aren't you?
05,15What if cats....were all actually dogs!
04Also
04flutter
Sceptileknight: you get pings just when someone types your name
04South Park did it
05,15We've been saying it wrong for years!
lolz, MLP has war and violence in it...docile my butt
05,15Ghosties I remember
04ChinPOOOOKOOOOMON!

so yeah
05,15Guys....what if The Phantom Pains....is ACTUALLY METAL GEAR SOLID V
04gtfo flutter
Sceptileknight: You should stay here during the weekdays. The streams are fun to watch. :)
05,15:(
i blame consoles for getting me too used to using a controller on fps game i'm even trying to get quake on the pc to use my controller
sometimes i pop out here when i am not busy
04The negative space above the title clearly reads "HALF LIFE 3 BY GABEN"
05,15HALF LIFE 3 IS A MYTH AND WILL NEVER COME OUT
D:
:O
fluttercry, like DNF
OH WAIT
i need to go see later
04Oh, you'll see
04It'll be worth the weight
Bye, Sceptileknight. :)
04See ya, Sceptile

05,15Yeah and look how well DNF turned out
bye
04...we
04...........we don't speak of that
fluttercry, indeed
Wii.
04Actually, I think DNF would be fun, especially since it's only like five bucks now
What if Fluttershy...wasn't a TREE?
05,15What if Borderlands 2...was actually a good game?
04And there's something hilariously charming about the biggest, baddest, most awesomemest, loved, wealthiest human being in the entire planet...who can't even spell his own name
05,15Nah, too far fetched
04g

05,15Okay...the Top Gun mission was pretty cool
There was a Top Gun mission?
04AIR BOSS JOHNSON
Ghosties: wait what :O
05,15Especially all the Val Kilmer guys that attack when you burn the net
oh wait, that mission
05,15and the Minecraft room was really cool
eeyup
Borderlands 2 was fun
still waiting for the level cap DLC however
being level 50 is no fun with no decent guns
Random Number Gods hate my ass

djblazekin: Towns.
CrystalPhoenix: Needs more googly eyes.
CrystalPhoenix: oh my...
googly eyes is best thing in the world next to bubble wrap
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: More Concept Art from Phil Ceasar
prove me wrong
CrystalPhoenix: This man speaks truth.
I might leave and play some Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition in a bit.
PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE HUGE BEAR EATING FROM THE REMAINS
Sumica, your townspeople are retards.
so is this game good?
neat song
alexxm|colt: micro managing TONS
you know what I want to see now
SO MUCH RAW MEAT!
ah ok otakon
Sumica, do you play very many first-person shooters that aren't called Battlefield or Call of Duty?
Derpy adorable stomping on bubble wrap
adorably**
wait....
BUBBLE WRAP
Sumica: Far Cry 3?
So, no chance of you streaming a playthrough of Duke Nukem 3D or Quake II?
O_o
Sumica: it's GOOOOOOOOOOD
Derpy....bubble cutie mark....bubble wrap....delivery service
Sumica: seriously even Yahtzee likes it, I have it and it's quite huge and awesome and open ended
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH how come I haven't seen this
where is the fluttershy yay comming frome
CrystalPhoenix: You just realized it now? .__.
well I just got bubble wrap in mind just now
Sumica: has NOTHING to do with the first two games, in name only sequel
and didn't bother about anything around Derpy really
XD Your cat sounds a lot like my cat, Sumica.
I still want to see Derpy adorably squishing bubble wrap
Sumica: yeah I know, but basically Far Cry franchise = HUGE open world shooter with lot's of freedom on how to approach the enemies
I'm gonna play Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic now. Later.
have fun CC..gone
is the gameloft mlp game any good
it's okay
It's fun for a while.
^
djblazekin: no.
but it has a LOT of timed based minigames
but the graphics are fitting with the show as is the music
I have patience with games like those, but when I realized that beating the game without purchasing anything without money takes MUCH longer than I realized.
it's just one of those stupid iOS games that tries it's hardest to manipulate you into microtransactions
aji: oh yeah
ahe AJIsAwesome oh yeah
i just took a shot of red wine now i'm feeling dizzy
otakon: lol hi
aji: DO YOU EVER TALK?
not really, lol
oh you do

6_9 sorry
i try to respond to highlights when possible though :3
ah
part of the job i guess
they don't bother me, though, so don't worry about it
And Princess Celstia costs $60 in the game. Prices are high.
wow

RainbowPengy: its not that bad, it only lags on games that have a higher quality resolution
SkunkTauri: She's not here until Saturday. :)
ok :)
lol those where prime example of good cops
that truck is Pinkie Pie - it is bouncy as all heck and it breaks physics
run people over! D:
On a console like the PS2 I thought all games were ment to run at the same res
like i said pcsx2 is incomplete and as flaw
jcelios: as the ps2 got older the games became more sophisticated and so did the graphics
the wii emulator run better on the same spec pc
then pcsx2
AWWW YEAH
Glitch time!
Stream froze for me
O_O Did that truck just....
yea it did
see, pinkie pie, right there

i love how in all gtas the most spawning car is the one you have
XUnfadingVirusX: cheat codes

probably the best professor ever

Silly Sumi, that's GTA, not Fallout

I miss the ammunation clerk
13really i just miss SA
he was so nice
http://derpy.me/SuDq9
they need to make a HD collection of the GTA series
I never wanted to kill him
13ooooo
i miss those crazy melee weapons
13my torrent has one of the SA multiplayer mods, never tried it though
http://i.imgur.com/HtpZs.jpg
like Katana or Golf Club... or dildo
13torrent is a few years old though so dunno if it's still tracked
13i know it's on steam :P
Got it before otakon this time.
SO why hasn't Rockstar made a GTAHD collection yet?
13has just been out of my price range every time ><
Katana is a good weapon for zombies
Hello.
Shizuka: wht do u mean tracked
seriously people would buy it up
Just look at walking dead
ride the rollercoaster
GTAIII, GTA: VC and GTA: SA
they would BUY IT ALL
13torrents are managed by trackers, servers that keep notes of who the peers are in the swarm
WHAAAT
^^
probs
Shizuka: u downloading red orcitrea 2?
13things are mostly moving towards distributed hash tables now where the peers in the swarm *are* the tracker, but trackers are still used to handle the initial setups
anyway off to play a bit of TL2
nyeh
i have a feeling that the gta stories kinda resemble scarface a small bit
TL2?

13maybe i just miss the cautious optimism of 1992...
Torchlight II.
Which is fun.
13there's a BTTF mod for 4 too

haseo348: i think the latest one, ask Sumica
dat translation:D It's like Hot Fuzz all over again
13SLOW DOWN, ARTICULATE
Sumica: what gta is this?
....Rasta is to English as Tolkien orcs are to elves. >_>
...I have no idea what happened, but I'm assuming Nico needs to get something
I've been eating REALLY cheaply for 3 weeks. It saves me about $10 a week. But it's a bit of a complicated matter. My mom's bugging me to buy Madsurge a copy of Half-Minute Hero since he gifted it to me for my birthday.
ok:D
He always needs to go somewhere and get something.
LOL
13eeeeee <3
13now i have two ender pouches on hot bar
I'm being a cheapskate and waiting for it to go 75% off, as I'd wait for anything else to be that low.
Right in front of the cop, Sumi? XD

Hanako: 4
cool
Uh, why is he pulling a gun on the burger guy?
/me has been playing that one again, oddly enough
Because he spat in his food
XD
Okay, as horrible as that was, I still laughed.
Sumica: cans you crash into a tree?
Kandarihu: Cheapskate is such a strong word... Can't trade steam games. Paying full price is like a luxery.
haseo348: What tree? You mean Fluttershy?
Sumica: stop for the lights
no a tree in the game
Kinixys, I meant as in gifting it to him.
....
http://www.fimfiction-static.net/images/story_images/48261.png?1347678678
...he would xD
Gettin' ballsy, Sumi?
Kandarihu: Right.

I love how you're doing this in broad daylight right outside their station and not a single fuck is being given by ANYONE
Because the cops are too stupid

That thing's as big as your character. ._.
NO
dammit Roman
Damnit Roman!
and then seks happened!
Goddamit Roman. I'm fucking busy
So is this before or after Niko kills Vlad?
And then nothing sexual happened at all. The end.
TheGentleManBrony, after
This is why you turn off your cell phone on stealth missions
Reikim: WROOOOOOOOOONG
Roman has fucking nothing to do with his time, does he?
It's sad when you can't use sarcasm anymore.
Anyway, Time to sleep now. Had to happen eventually.
Enjoy your stream.
Night, Reikim

Love this game and Saints Row 2
badman is cool, but Jacob is better
Badman - LC's Batman
Badman. Such a stereotypical Jamaican name
Can't imagine why.
I heard that there's a way to go through the whole story being forced to kill only two people from beginning to end.
um
I mean, not like they just heard a firefight upstairs.... :P
no
There are more kills than that
that you must do
....
Nicolas Cage?
:D
Are you sure he's not taking one?
but if niko dosen't kill them, they'll DIE.
LOL
Hanako, I'm pretty sure there are multiple paths in the game. Sumica obviously isn't taking the almost-pacifist run.
niko is best russian
AHHHHH
She gets out of her car to beat you up like she's some badass.

Get Shot.

fun thing about drunk driving
piswaser!
So Jacob starts beating the shit out of a dude and the cops get mad at you?
GET TO DA CHOPWA
the game pulls you toward the nearest solid object
The cops in this town are worse than incompetent. Even *I* can hit a guy at that range.
Sumica: COPS ALL OVER THE PLACE
The cops are more drunk and high than they were!
CriticKitten: NYC cops are issued guns with ridiculously bad triggers and they are not taught to shoot outside of academy
hey, jacob stoped smoking
anyone thats sober could shoot at that range, that was just sad.
most of them barely qualify
bombacloth
Hanako: Even NYC cops can hit the broad side of a barn, though.
not really
and no, i have no idea what does that mean
That guy literally missed from 2 yards away
The cops "He got his friend home! We have to leave him alone.
did you hear earlier about how they shot all those innocents
"No rookie. Its da rules!"
I did, but they still hit the perp.
eventually
lol
And the fact that they hit people at all means that they still are better than these guys.
Sumi you could turn on sleep mode or whatever. It stops the calls from friends and gf
If only rl was like that

Roman in a nut shell "TITIES! STRIP CLUB! COUSIN!"
You choose to go out with Roman, game is like "Um, okay, but you can totally cancel that if you want, you know."
Even the game thinks Roman is a fuckwit.
He honked his horn

carwash dislikes ur car sumi :D
Do what I always did in Mafia 2, just drift 180 and drive back towards the police. It always took them about a half hour to turn around.
that not right
I wonder what wouldv'e happened had the wash allowed it, what with the cops on his ass.
i don't think pay'n'spray takes it either
I was long gone before they could turn around
"Sorry mister, but we just can't do anything in this case"
Wow, the cops just PIT everyone BUT the player. my god, they really suck XD
No, PayNSpray takes it, but it can't do much
I think it would still look like ass
Sumica: maybe
it would be coated with a new layer of ass
"The best I can do with a wreck like this"
It's be...50 shades of shit
It would be a shiny metal ass though Sumi
double ass-tastic
check it Sumi, paynspray is near park
hey bro

I mean hydrant
08,01Alchemist: i don't pay tuition for university, because i'm scottish and going to a scottish university

08,01Ryunosuke: you say commie, i say progressive
Insurance? lol
08,01not from england, though
My political views: Extreme Far Left Socialist Liberal Communist
Progressiveness is cool with me
08,01if you're from england, you need to pay £9000/year for my uni
well... I think socialist programs are not a bad thing tbh
look at most of europe
08,01Alchemist: where's that?
08,01socialist != communism
Scotland voted for independence?
08,01also, socialism is awesome
08,01a_snake: we're voting in 2014
08,01i'm voting no, because scottish independence is ridiculous
Ah, I thought it was taking place this year.
however... here, we have dumbass redneck hicks who make foreign policy that does not know the difference
08,01we wouldn't be part of the EU anymore; we'd have to re-apply
Not gonna lie, I eventually want to live in a different country, I was thinking UK or Japan
and that is dangerous at best
involuntary euthanasia. NO,

Sketch_Toku_Brony: gta talk radio XD

08,01seriously, india has over a billion people
RainbowPengy: More like NPR
PLR is the liberal news radio
08,01that's just fucked up
WKTT is the fox news radio
08,01it's not even all that big a place
a_snake: also you'd be hungry in a half hour

08,01we need a mandatory IQ test
08,01if you get below a certain amount, you're made into soup

>steal car in front of cop, cop worried about car in middle of the road
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I thought it was a kid? XD

lol biker just rides by casually past uy w/ shotgun :D
*guy
Blista Compact is a fun little car
Kipkat07_USAF: I dont think so, im pretty sure most people on the chat have an IQ above 50
soulero: XD
50 is pretty lol so yea
old lady casually dropping her umbrella

I like having fun with the muscle cars, theyre good for drifting and burning out

Kipkat07_USAF: unaffiliated, but lean liberal
Goes to bed. Puts shades on.
if H2O is water, what is H2O4
oni_link: lol inb4 csi moment :D
H2SO4 is sulfuric acid
Sketch_Toku_Brony: its unavoidable XD
I actually thought for a little while I was a *shudder* conservative
>come alone
personally I dont fully like any of the major parties, but the less shitty shit is lib dems, so I guess I support them
Little Jacob is a bro
oni_link: lol ikr saw a really funny one of Dead Rising 2 w/ that :D
pony_7777: what is H2O4 I asked
Sketch_Toku_Brony: lol how did it go?
di-hydrogen Quad-oxide
the power of google?
:I
thought you mistyped
quad=tetra
thats not really something that requires google
billy was a chemists son but now he is no more, what he thought was h2o was h2so4
H2O is 4 drinking swimming bathing etc
its just duo, tetra,quad,quant affixes
drill em both
oni_link: it was the boss fight w/ a security guard who fell onto a saw table and Chuck wearing a SWAT suit w/ shades says "Never saw that one coming..." then cuts away to the YEEAAHH :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: hahaaha
It's a TRAP!
completely not a trap lol
OH. SHIT.
vat a twist
THE PLOT THICKENS!
theyre terrible at traps
love this mission
I mean really, its nearly solid
I don't know why people don't like Niko. He's freaking awsome
Everyone likes CJ
more
CJ was a pimp
niko is best character
make it a bun dem niko!
meh CJ's was cheesy imo
*story and his character
I liked the gang element
i liked SA for its cheats
oni_link: What? I though CJ was the least likeable of all speaking protagonists
yeah that was fun
niko is pretty cool, even if he was a war criminal and other-kinds-of-crimes criminal
oni_link: I dunno, the forced stereotypical ghetto gangbanger persona got annoying after a while.
SirGanjalf: everywhere I look, people tell me they like CJ the most
i liked CJ for his char. customization
Alchemist: yeah, thats exactly what Im saying
it was cheesy
and forced, soo very forced
those guys have a pretty bad aim
oni_link: Probably fanboys who think that if they like game, they have to like everything in it
stormtrooperaim.exe
and for Kipkat07_USAF :) : http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v83/i12/p6275_s1?isAuthorized=no
My favorite thing to do in these kind of missions is to call a 6 star wanted level and then when cops get here just hide
Cops and enemies fight for major lulz
I wish I had a better pc. Cant run GTA 4
i can run gta 4 decently on my laptop :)
my skyrim lags even on 800x600
hell, even on 640x480
Luckily it runs pretty decent on my not-so-high-end PC
i can run any game that released so far without problem :3
and the gang war stuff was cool
I can run fallout w/ minimal lag but skyrim runs soo laggy
been*
the lighting is what makes skyrim lag as hell for me
um jacob
sight~
twilight_sprinkle: try putting your shader and shadowing lower, that should help
but you know, very very small amounts that occur naturally
oni_link: gta isnt usually big on the stories, though Vice city's was better than SA's imo.
dat broken siren
xD only half the sound
Alchemist: I liked that one too but it had scarface written all over it
is this a cyclops squad car? :d
oni_link: is that in-game options? cause i have them all on low already, even got some lighting mod that helped a bit
III and IV are my favorites so far
oni_link: well I guess it was kinda the point.
gta4 is the only gta i beat the story so far
i never rly like those game
only had fun messing around with friends
Alchemist: yeah but it was too transparent about that
problem, officer?
i beat gta: sa, and the psp gta's minus chinatown
porbelm officer
the psp ones were great
oni_link: Story was ok at the beginning(that is, if you don't mind ghetto climate), but later after leaving Los Santos it has lost consistency. Some of the mission were James Bond shit - fun, but deadly for the plot
twilight_sprinkle: its in the setting iirc and have you also tried putting the draw setting lower and turning particles and water reflections off?
*missions
i loved the gta libety city stories theme <3
oni_link: thinking about it now, Im actually surprised noone raised an issue about the similarities legally :D
oni_link: i think so
Alchemist: yeah thats true o.o
If I get pulled over Im going to pull out a trollface mask and say "Problem?"
SirGanjalf: Yeah the desert. thats all i have to say XD
hi
dat ad...
Salivex! *imitates a tranny's voice* Now I can suck a LOLIPOP all night
oni_link: have you turned off anti-aliasing? edges look crap, but saves major resources
Kipkat07_USAF You and me think in the same way... that's why I have a trollface mask sitting in the compartment under the driver's seat in my car. LOL
XD
pony_7777: hes giving me advice :P
pony_7777: I was just about to suggest that to twilight_sprinkle , Im trying to see what can be done to free resources
serial killer in city... and worried about the nickname for him :D
pony_7777: but ill check that
thx for advice
twilight_sprinkle: youre gonna get jaggies when you move your camera but it should help the game run smoother
- start of brokebakc mountain -
yea what can you afford *stare at the car in the back*
Ok guys i think im gonna go hit the hay, see ya later for BMN :)
oni_link: hm well ill try it. werent there different kinds of anti-aliasing?
bye NocturnalBlade
twilight_sprinkle: also try putting model and textures to lower settings if you havent already. and if you have multiple cores, enable that in the settings. some games take advantage of multiple cores . theres different settings but to make games run smoother I usually turn it off altogether
and some game take one core by default
like all valve games by default
NOOO ALL THE NUDE MAGAZINES DESTROYED!!
nuuuuuuuuu the apartment ;~;
oni_link: well if skyrim can do that, ill try it, thanks
no problem twilight_sprinkle
sumi have you played throught this story already?
thorugh*
lolz
/me sings along with the radio
through
twilight_sprinkle: nope
ok
far from it
Im running on old hardware so I know what youre going through. I cant run skyrim at all XD video memory is too low and its soldered on
roman stop your bitching
not being able to run game sucks that why i made sure i could run everything
twilight_sprinkle: nope its not the end yet
oni_link: how far?
twilight_sprinkle: i think like less than a third of the way
aw poor roman
oni_link: ah ok
RainbowPengy: yeah, thats why Im saving up for a gaming laptop
never saw this far into the game before
poor roman
but everyone says I should get a desktop
gaming laptop is an oxymoron
cause its cheaper and all that
i have a custom made desktop
/me sings "Movin on up
costed alot but had no problem for about 3 year
now its nikos turn to have a meltdown
there used to be a glitch you can do with that wooden wardrobe. you climb it from the left and wiggle around and then you climb through the wall and fall through the map and end up outside, did they patch that yet Sumica ?
oni_link: desktops are easyer to upgrade
she sounds EXACTLY like my math teacher
and less easy to over heat too
that too
pony_7777: I know theyre more future proof
arent desktops tend to be cheaper than laptops with a similar performance?
If I wanted to build one that could run games out now at max, what would my budget be?
that car is called a Coquette Sumica
Alchemist: mostly better for cheaper
badger badger badger badger badger
oni_link: I guess 1000 usd
Man, I can't wait 'till GTA V.
better performance, if you know how to set up the guts
hello y'all
I think im gonna buy a prebuilt overclocked system. in terms of processors idk if i should go with AMD or Intel
hello?
oh this guy
oni_link: you should buy the parts and build/OC it yourself.
I was going to overclock my moms computer but she would have shotgun diarreha
hi eraykaan
and then he was on camera
'Sup sugarcube?
welp
I know for a fact I want to go with AMD for graphics
hoi eraykaan
niko is camera shy
"Sorry
but for processors im still unsure
what OS are you gonna use
oni_link: intel is better for OCing, typicaly
heh back to small-time missions
twilight_sprinkle: howdy sugarcube?
Linux is best OS
rly ?
im good eraykaan ,you?
im ok
but theres alot of game not compatible linux aint it ?
k eraykaan :)
I used to have a tower with an X4 black edition, that processor was nice :3 I think I might go with that again
Kipkat07_USAF: I cant be assed to learn to use it and win works just fine for the stuff I use it for.
Windows is good for steam games
isnt steam coming to linux?
yeah
it is
ubuntu only
Im gonna make a dual boot
once that happens Im completely switching to Linux. I dual boot vista and ubuntu
stalking
ewwww vista
Nvidia is horrible at giving linux drivers right? I dont really remember

Im fine with 7 , I was thinking of making a dual boot tower with ubuntu
yayyy movie night

how is it? looks like a complete redisign.
RainbowPengy, I never heard that.
@eraykaan
i couldnt hear what you said about the drivers Sumica , I had to answer the phone just then :c
i had win7 32 and now i have 64bit
let'ssquish some people!
windows 8 looks like the X-Box 360 Dashboard
squish
Im the one linux elitist whose a condescending arrogant elitist to anyone who uses windows or *shudders* apple...
squish
aslong as it the same version
ah thanks how come though?
ah so it takes up resources
Kipkat07_USAF: you using Gentoo?
*whispers*you know you want to squish people
pony_7777: I dont know coding language yet but once I learn that and pass the IT A+ exam Im gonna upgrade straight to debian
so would I be okay making a linux tower on nvidia hardware?
i know coding >_>
thats really the only reason I havent done so yet
If you are using an Intel system go nVidia. If you are using an AMD system go AMD. They talk to each other better that way.
Kipkat07_USAF: i have a deb machine. works nice. no lang. skills needed, really
asshole, stole your car
my back hurts
dat accent
ah thanks []DeadpoolDash
'If you areusing an AMD system go AMD'
well there goes your car sumi
lel.
pony_7777: I want to make sure Im a computer expert
Im seriously thinking of going with Intel and AMD now
Real smart.
:D
i mean nvidia XD
stepped on air. PINKIE LOGIC
Not talking to you.
intel + nvidia
lol
So I have about 600 bucks now, should I continue saving ?
yes
use POW block!
you don't need to do all that. I was IT for a year, no previous training.
I want to lay down because my back hurts but I dont want to fall asleep
should I?
Well thanks for the advice everyone
i paid mine 1000$ 3 year ago and no problem running any game so you could most likely get the same for less now

i couldnt see a single meteor :(
why not? I was able to see 2 as I was walking back to my living hall...
they were incredibly bright - I could see them through all of the light pollution?
random question mark was random
overcast here, no meteors :(
idk, i was outside 8 hours ago, when they were supposed to be at masimu, and didnt see any
and sky was clear too
there was a meteor shower ?
rip tv
*maximum
well, I saw two within the last 10 minutes of walking back to my room
so they're still there

Ninjazz: I had such a day myself yesterday. Nothing bothering, but just a string of irritating things making me grumpy and worthless for the whole night :|
/me kisses aniderp|bestcakeever :D
MadSurge: watch meteors, everything will be better

Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/b61a6700faac57aae062f3f74157f51c.png and what about this? Does this make sense to you? :D
Gold_Demona: hi!

Eeyup. Heck. You got problem, Mojay?

MadSurge, more sense than most, yes.
Gold_Demona: just finally started Black 2. Nuuuu old mons with the newer mons D: :D
MadSurge: Personally, I thought that was awesome. :>
still no sign of @ghosties >_< ... i WILL find him/her one day XD
Ninjazz: RariPinkie :D
QBAlchemist, one does not simply find a ghosties. One must hunt a ghosties.
MadSurge, cute.
Gold_Demona: I already got the water mouse :D
i'm good Gold_Demona you
Ninjazz: one has been hunting a ghosties for two weeks 0_o

but i couldnt help it :<
._.
you two would make cute couple :>
lol
I...what.
Someone is a yaoi fan I take
more of a yrui fangirl though
xD
aniderp|bestcakeever: ah yes, you like girls do you? :D
yes
I wouldn't say I'm a yaoi "fan" per se, but I do entertain thoughts of some oddball shipping. XD
i ship me and marceline the vampire queen o.O
she would be the best vampire wife ever <3
I do not have an emote that properly expresses my expression.
/me hugs her marceline plushies
plushie*
I draw the line at incest pairings though. That I don't find entertaining at all. >.>
oh i started this one story
about dead or alive..
ayane and kasumi.. i was writing it then in the game i found they were sisters..
but in my story they are best friends who are lovers..
ha ha time for wincest? >.>
i had no clue they were sisters until the end of the game..
so that was not my knowing,,,
whazup dudes
thinking of yuri pairs o//o
dude I met this fox and he gave me these special leaves
That's like Luke and Leia. XD
I felt a real deep connection with him man
luke and leia are siblings?
/me is shot
i know leia is a princess
anakin is luke's father
duh duh duh
aniderp|bestcakeever: Luke and Leia are twins
Their mom died giving birth to them.
Which was RIGHT after Anakin fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader
Gold_Demona: in one of the most contested prequels ever
:S
didnt anakin get burned alive?
aniderp|bestcakeever: that too
MadSurge: Personally, I take the basic story of the prequels as canon, but the movies themselves I ignore.
But he survived
Gold_Demona: yeah
/me licks someone
aniderp|bestcakeever: That's why he ends up in the big black suit when he becomes Vader. It keeps him alive. :P
He's a big bad cyborg
Eeyup
With breathing problems
remember the stream yesterday?
about the pink gun xD
Nope. I wasn't here
it was before i did my work
and the guy said the f word D:
I've been very little in here yesterday
i tried to watch yaoi before.. with someone but it was like not good since the one kid guy had big eyes o.O
idk if it was a kid/guy ..

That's cool. :>

xD
lol Yeah, gotta buy yourself some stuff while you're at it. :D
bring all the money!
you have a kid?
....And by "kids" I mean kids in their upper teens. :D
One of them's in college. :D
HELL no I don't have kids
Only kids I buy for are nieces and nephews
I dont like kids
I like kids well enough, but I don't think I'd be a good parent
not yet at least
what does the hubby say?
Hubby doesn't like kids. XP
He no wanty at all.
Renting kids should be invented.
its called baby sitting and you get paid for it
Also foster parenting
That kinda counts as renting kids
so much bullshit involved doing the foster stuff though
but your hubby was a kid once
I dont know how exactly it works, but I've never heard anything positive about it.
aniderp|bestcakeever: Um... so?
That means nothing. =P
hehe
i still act like a child sometimes is that bad?
Nope
I still do sometimes.
Sometimes to make my hubby laugh, sometimes to make him roll his eyes at me. =P
If you accept responsibility while doing so then its okay.
lol at work me and my work sis act liek 7 year olds sorta xD
but we can cause we are adults
we need some funn....
Im far too serious, but I cant change it.
my mental age is like 15 xD
Alchemist: you're still pleasant to talk to :)
im 20.. with a mental age of 15
My husband's really serious too, but I think I'm slowly corrupting him to the childish side. :D
thats normal right?
Ultimate proof: he watches ponies with me. :D
MadSurge: :) thanks.
I'm 27, with an mental age of 200+
but im fun to talk to right?
I'm 28, mental age caries depending on mood. :P
Vordox: whats a 200+ yr old mind like?
Old and decrepit. :D
Very very...

Have one hour of Anime Openings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqMY7CNQ73o
Talking about dragging someone to the bedroom reminds me of a fanart. But I wonder if it's SFW enough....

You guys want me to link it?
Suddenly silent
Contemplating huh :p
i need to find more derpy to save then put on timeline..

Eh, I think it's SFW enough. But at least I put the NSFW warning first.
I hope people still remember Johnny Bravo....
Do the monkey with me.

Alchemist he would be the master man whore
I was laughing for almost 5 minutes when I saw that.

Man I love Huey.
Oh here we go XD
paganism is good
lol
Charlie Brown.
looool
As long as there are no human sacrifices I'm fine with paganism :D
He's mixing little-known truth with politically correct nonsense, and other ideas that I honestly hope are just "Huey being Huey".
Nigga better pay what he owes hahaha

Oh yeah, because plastic pellets hurt sooo much
The joke is that's what your news actually sounds like.
I want to go to a white neighborhood and do that hahaha
Kandarihu: yeah
back, what i miss?
Meanwhile: my news? I wouldnt know since I don't watch that garbage?
I'd rather read an article
Should've probably aimed at that Kandarihu to avoid the confusion so that's my bad.
the news is always out for the shock factor. all they care about is ratings
AHEM
Implying they have any integrity.
snow!
Meanwhile, well they should still be held to a higher standard than they are.
Well, you're racist anyway so you probably would say that.
Meanwhile, I'm not racist.
So much tension between you two...
If I didn't know any better, I'd put you both on the shipping list!
That was horrible Scoot.
Mm.
Meanwhile x Kandarihu hahaha
^^
OTP
You're horrible, Jmo :|
Only to you.
All I cn say is that I agree with Jmo
Don't be such a Tsundere, Meanwhile~
you can't ship Meanwhile he already is part of a otp
I-it's not like I want you or anything. Baka.
oh is he SpeccyRush ?
K-kawaii...
SpeccyRush, I'm straight.
He wasn't even implying you.
^
oh my god who the hell cares
calm thine tits CTHULHU
oh my god family guy quote
Like you have anything usefuol to say CTHULHU

and?
/me is an irresponsibly white man
The Adventures of Ethnically Accurate Jesus.
Congratulations on verifying your worth.
Meanwhile, except that the Jewish people were caucasian.
...

*this
^-^
Scoot-Scootaloo~ <3
Kandarihu: WHAT? :D
Jesus must have been short and dark-skinned
That is, if he existed

unionyoshi
Morning, everyone
hiyo AttackWithHugs
'Lo AttackWithHugs.
how are things Dark92Enigma
YOU KNOW THE DRILL PRINCESS, I KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS KINGDOM THAN YOU'LL EVER DO, THIS IS THE 100TH TIME DOING IT!
AttackWithHugs! <3
alexxm|colt: been fine, bro...picked your movies yet?
:O The toads are unknown!
/me hugs oni_link, MadSurge and snuggles in Meanwhile's mane
Dark92Enigma the crow and the castle of caglistro
Rofl
lol
hahahahaha
They be trolling :D
weak baby bitch hands XD
Troll Matt.
alexxm|colt: cool! i'd like to reveal mine, but it should be a secret, right'?
YAAAAAAY
XD
i guess Dark92Enigma oh yeah i also got a couple of wwe dvds yesterday
Mario is srs bzns
I decided not to vote this time. This is the only time I DECIDED not to vote.
The toads are played by women!
alexxm|colt: Bret Hart and CM Punk?
Bret The Hitman Hart.
Dark92Enigma best of king of the ringn and best ppv matches of 2009 - 2010
It's because I'll be on the road during both Brony Movie Nights.
Kandarihu: that's funny, the ONLY time i decided not to vote, is when i got too late to do so.......and the movie i was about to pick got picked by somepony else.
the next week, however, i won
Kandarihu: so you know him?
Dark92Enigma, awesome.
btw, that movie was WFRR?
Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
so, Two Best Friends Play huh?
Dark92Enigma, probably not.
Dark92Enigma: GREAT movie
otakon: No, bad Game Grumps commentary
I picked WFRR
oh
OH WAIT, they are ALL bad~
Scoot-Scootaloo: wait, this isn't Game Grumps
None of the movies I've been picking have ever been picked by anyone else.
Scoot-Scootaloo: screw you they'
re funy!
otakon: yes, and i wasn't there to write the review, i was about to give it a categoric 10/10
otakon: way to be a super slueth
sleuth*
Scoot-Scootaloo: way to be a chicken
:P
0/10
Why do they compare those two series all the time? Theyre different
the only time i've won so far, is the pony episode A: Friendship Is Magic (Pilot)
Because they're similar.
same concept but different execution
I change my choice of A Movie from time to time. But my B Movie has always been the same time since it came out on DVD this Summer.
SpeccyRush: i know, and i wasn't there to congratulate you :)......Congratulations
so far, i haven't changed my A and B movies, but the pony episodes do change from time to time
thanks.. I guess
hiya Meanwhile
Definitely Maybe, Meanwhile :$
wow what a dick
hahaha
XD
Scoot-Scootaloo: DARK SOULS!
please?
That succulent Toad's ass :D
Never should the phrase "Succulent toad ass" be uttered.
Meanwhile: and yet you have :3
never indeed Meanwhile XD
:O
IT'S A CARTOOOOOOOON
and saved for posterity
um
whoa dem colors
it's the most wonderful time......of the yeaaaaaaaar
why is it inverse?
inb4 g-major
Scoot-Scootaloo: it would be scarier in G MAJOR
If ONLY I knew...
wow Cat is a cheapskate bastard
I kinda alwways hated this show :(
^
and hi everyone :)
i forgot who those VAs were famous for doing work as
'Lo Lil_B.
how are things Lil_B
hi Lil_B been awhile eh?
Didn't have Nickelodeon, so never saw this until adulthood
Hey Lil_B :)
i can't believe i'm gonna say this: but even when i watched CatDog before Spongebob, i can't unhear him everytime i hear Dog talk
I hear Ed Asner
hey its the Flying Dutchman
Ed Asner IIRC
thanks Meanwhile alexxm oni_link and MadSurge :)
what happend to the colares =
?
Scoot-Scootaloo: did you bleach the video?
Too much?
oni_link 2 weeks of no Internet :)
too much
Lil_B: THE HORROR
Lil_B: wow welcome back :3
there we go, still looks a bit bleached but good
otakon was ok, appearently I dfidn't even miss much :/
Good enough~
THE RABBIT
Just... shield your eyes a bit
eww
ugh
even the NAME sounds abyssmal
"Cutest, sweetest"
Rancine.... ew
He is obviously blind
I always hated that rabbit
and his niece or whatever
I wanna smack em with a bat
oni_link: me too, he's like the main antagonist
>I want to buy you
>Slavery
yeah such a scumbag
... in this Universe, Lifes of regular Citizens are Buyable...
also yeah if he buys them then doesn't that mean he gets his money back?
oh look it's Winslow
A smaller moustacheless version of Meanwhile
not too much smaller though
Who did Winslow's VA do?
Ba-dum tish.
Its very familiar
Rocko maybe?
Holy crap, its sun out here
yeah same here
and that MIGHT be Rocko
Doesn't Winslow LIVE in their house?
It sounds kinda like em
and he does
he has tunnels everywhere though
inb4 that's the real Santa
... I want to make these rabbits dissapear
forever
lol
THE HORROR!
NOOOO!
FOUREVER!
and of course they BLAME IT ALL ON CATDOG
bc EVERYTHING is Catdog's fault apparently in this show
yup
meh.
When in doubt, blame the freak.
I never liked that about this show
Seriously they blame EVERYTHING on those two
everything...
GLOBAL WARMING! IT'S CATDOG'S FAULT!
I GOT LEUKEMIA! IT'S CATDOG'S FAULT!
yeah I applaud the show for it's insanity and the message of being yourself but CD being the scapegoat for EVERYTHING turned me off greatly from it.
otakon: yeah that was always an issue for me too
YIKES
and then SLAVERY
hallo everypony o.o
it's nearly as bad as Cannabilism in "The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy"
Slavery Catdog's f-oh no, hang on that was the bible.
hiya LightTrooper105
Hey LightTrooper105! :)
GRAB HER!
/me slaps otakon and MadSurge with muffins
Meanwhile, no.
let her die
lol
well
that was fitting
ooh, muffins
Yes. And if you decide to block that out of your chosen circle of belief I'll start talking about the crusades instead.
that did improve her situation when you think about it hahaha
bye guys
Meanwhile: next you'll say the priest's got molesting kids from the bible when really they are just freaks
bye alexxm take care
later alexxm
otakon: No that's just freaks.
Meanwhile, the Bible only said that masters should be kind to their slaves.
Meanwhile: besides slavery has existed before the bible
bc well humanity wasn't but two hairs away from a baboon
mmm
True, but not on the scale it eventually did. The Bible says that sinners skin turned black, which led to the dehumanisation of black people, if you need the rest explained to you you're too young to be on the internet.
lol the bible is racist
Meanwhile: oh shit I forgot about that
a little late for that Scoot-Scootaloo XD
Meanwhile: that Mormon origins video said the same thing
Meanwhile, I don't remember anything about that. Sounds like you're making that up.
theye been going at it for awhile
Sounds like you should read your own holy book.
yeah, I know. Studying ATM
Kandarihu: well I know that is what the Mormon's believe
I has no religion hah
Meanwhile: I treat the bible as any other religion and myth book tbh
So take your communists beliefs to the PM's please~
lol
I could go on about how shellfish are evil and so are women who wear trousers, but the self proclaimed angry jealous god really nails it.
lol
And yeah alright Alej, done now.
Scoot-Scootaloo, this is a three way argument, now.
women who wear trousers are evil...
XD
Kandarihu: Not anymore.
So stop that shizzle
Scoot-Scootaloo has spoken
The exact line for sake of clarity is "Women shall not wear garments that pertain unto a man"
Well, it seems to be otakon and myself vs Meanwhile.
"For to do is an abomination unto the lord thy God" I think I got that right.
no one is vs. anything
he EATS SOAP?
Kandarihu: I can make it a two way when I click the BAN button...
otakon: yup
no one is arguing
Scoot-Scootaloo: seriously no one is getting their jimmies rustled
hahaha
That's what I thought :$
Scoot-Scootaloo, Meanwhile is saying things that I have to respond to.
PMs. Learn them
yeah I'm not trying to argue
I'm just commenting on the oddities of The Bible
And otakon... he's just otakon. No need to argue with him~
Luv ya, otakon <3
oh thanks Chick-Chicken
And I'm terrible with one on one debates.
one does not Have to respond
<-----oh god...
and KICKED
lol didnt she get preggers
and BACK
or not
But one has to get kicked for using bold text.
eeyup
hmm forgot to set auto rejoin
SpeccyRush, uh, bold still counts as a color code, I guess.
oh shiiii its arthur
Arthur?
SpeccyRush: bold is WHITE
really?
Oh I knew I'd be kicked for it
CTHULHU: sure why not?
Autojoin doesn't work if it's instant on here anyway.
ah
You got a PROBLEM with Arthur, nyuggah?
horrible song though
SpeccyRush, do you have Autojoin on your X-Chat? I can't seem to find it on my Hexchat. It's a different fork, I know.
NO TINSEL!
I freaking HATE tinsel
it's a pain in the ass to put up and take down
What's wrong with tinsel.
How fucking hard can it be to hang glittery string on a tree?
Kandarihu, honestly don't know don't use clients so much to know yet
I've got some on my bedframe it didn't cause me intense discomfort.
Meanwhile: if you want it to look right, you have to do it ONE BRANCH AND STRING AT A TIME
You do it weird.
othewise it clumps and doesn't hang properly
and it looks bunched together, also that is the most eloquent 4 yr. old ever.
lol tinsel
i dont use it
YAY CAPITALISM!
the talking what??
Should have told the guys in the fiftes about the horror the Green Menace instead of them worrying about the Red Menace
and i thought "grandma got runover by a raindeer" was bad
lol
I. HATE. MY. FUCKING. 10. YEAR. OLD. NIECE.
why VenHur
?
likamillion
...Don't ask...
...It just hell to me...
ah
um wat?
<-- Swedish :D
ohh
but does it blend?
All countries besides my own are awesome
VenHur: dude she's ten, you'll get used to it
George is Swedish?
Wrek's new name is George from now on.
no
and buster is awesome, he doesnt judge by smell/appearance
that's my name
HE CAN'T HAVE MY NAME
otakon: [eyes casts on fire, demonic voice] NO I WILL NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
VenHur: lol NOPONY BREAKS A PINKIE PROMISE
VenHur: oh does she happen to watch MLP? :P
otakon: ...No...
oh damn
otakon: At least...I don't think so...
VenHur: show the the magic
her*
VenHur, are your parents and her parents aware of whatever feuds you've had with her?
FLUGLEHORN!
FLUUUUUUUUUUUUUGLEHORN!
I never like Muffy
huh
hello
stream go poof for anyone else?
for a bit
Kandarihu: Well, I TRIED to hitted her with a mallet, I TRIED to make her suicide off a cliff ala Final Fantasy V, I TRIED to possess her mind with that's of a chicken's, etc, etc, etc.
lol the veginator
VenHur: dude have you tried GETTING ALONG?
the vagineers best friend
otakon: ...No...
try that
VenHur, how is she getting under your skin?
my little sister was like that
Mine too
when she was much younger
damn that is a LONG LINE
IKR
holy hell
Eeeyup
oh yeah right really?
I did that once
Narcoleptic Cashier
I want Arthur
lol and then he put her to sleep... good turn about though
*s boots
lol
and his hat
and watch
It's really up to the cashier to count the change, not the customer.
Kandarihu: eeyup
yup
I did that once
paid with nothing but quarters
i did it with nothing but pennies
I felt kind of bad about it
but money is money
The cashier looked pissed
not surprised, when I worked at DD you have NO idea how many people would get a small coffee JUST to break a 20
seriously they were 89 CENTS folks
lol
Remixception, that reminds me of an episode of Dexter's Laboratory.
InB4 Coinstar
The one where he has to buy a new lightbulb? or am i thinking of a different one.
Kandarihu: ...I just HATE her, HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE her!
oh look Uncle Fred
VenHur: breathe man
nom
lol
hello
otakon: HOW CAN I FUCKING BREATH AT A TIME LIKE THIS?!
VenHur: just remember, shes only a kid
I don't have the heart to take extra change from an absent minded cashier, if I realize it...
Remixception: you know they'll all eventually burn out right?
VenHur: yeah she'll grow out of it
?
Remixception: You dissappoint me sir
What otakon?
Ohai Dishwasher_EXTREME!
DISSAPPOINTMENT!
sorry i just woke up
like litterally 5 seconds ago
I like the sound of Roast Lamb
they eat meat?
CTHULHU: we do too you know
I love hummus
CAMEL!
it's probably like horse though
otakon: [eye twitch]
which means it's tough as hell
Girls have been known to mature faster than boys. Try to give her another chance. But do set boundaries, of course.
lol im listening to " i love the whole world" ....totally gonna play this on the 21st
VenHur: give her one more year, she'll start to grow out of it
otakon: ONE MORE FUCKING YEAR?! MY FAMILY IS STAYING OVER HERE FOR A FUCKING MONTH OR TWO!
VenHur, so you're visiting her, not the other way around?
Kandarihu: OTHER way around...
oh, its a Scoot-Scootaloo stream, yay
i only ask for one thin a year
VenHur, so she's visiting you?
i always though that singer was kinda hot as a kid o/////o
Kandarihu: Yes!
oni_link: dude, Minerva Mink. 'nuff said.
oni_link don't feel alone. I did too.
...Jessica Rabbit...nuff talk.
lol feeling better about that now, thanks guys
VenHur: yeah but that wasn't really a kids movie
goddamn
and those were pretty hot as wele
29 times now
oh no she didn't
burn
oh no she didn't
*well
oh I see
that escalated quickly
it's in parts on YT
Hell if you think about it, most of the Disney Princesses are hot too
too true
maybe
/me grabs otakon
Ariel
...After my family leaves...I need thousand of years of therapy...
seriously, she's NUDE FROM THE WASTE DOWN
but screw snow white
whoa
oh please don't sing
PLEASE DONT SING!
who?
well Snow White was the first, and during the 40's so VERY conservative
Dishwasher_EXTREME: you've NEVER seen Snow White and the Seven Dwarves?
ugh the songs hurt my soul
oh god...
Dishwasher_EXTREME: What the FUCK is wrong with your life?!
That mooon.
/me 's souls dies a bit
ive seen alright
that moon is creepy but majoras moon is still the creepiest
oni_link: no arguement
oh i almost forgot
agreed
I thought all incarnations of the moon were creepy...
/me slips free from Bronysith's grip
VenHur groovy dude

...It's a...white giant rock...in space...and it's looking at me...with no face...
...It always watching...ME...
O_O
I CAN SEE YOU....
Slenderman is always watching me.
ALWAYS!
If you listen closely, you'll hear talking on the edge of your hearing
When I see the full moon I think of Luna
they don't like being listened to
and you guys never watch me
Sun: you hurt our eyes
Hey Slendamann, whatcha doin' in a cartoon fo' kids?
Sun: you give us cancer

MC Vaginas back in this bitch
yes call a mod a whore that will end well
Ok I was watching the Morpha fight in OOT and I find it sad fucking Morpha on a N64 looks better and more fluidly animated than fucking Chaos from Sonic Adventure
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: that's bc Chaos was in a launch title
otakon: The thing is they made chaos because they wanted something only the Dreamcast could do
plus lower polygon count means usually more fluid animation
Yet N64 does that shit fine
yeah I feel you
but it's simple
Plus chaos looks plain retarded
well his final form anyway
lower polygons + low res textures USUALLY=better frame rate
gak
Funnily enough DX made Perfect Chaos look sort of worse

ide like to see an all luna ep, and an all derpy ep, but so far they have had all good to great eps
yeah... i miss the stream
PuddleJumper: Good luckw ith the derpy one...
the pinky one had me and my kid laughing my ass off
Soccer moms already had a fuckign fit with derpy being mentioned by name alone
i think i got a mlp plushie somewhere im our house :D
yeah, well, it is a kids show...ment to sell toys....you would think from looking at the derpy brushies going for 100 bucks they would go....hmmm well, screw them!
PuddleJumper: You know why they had a fit about derpy?
Arcium what plushie? c:
the same reason they have a fit about anything remotely contravertial? nothing better to bitch about?
PuddleJumper: They though she was making fun of retarded people...>.>
/me wants lyra
Because they think us disabled people are so fucking sensitive we cant speak for ourselves.
http://orendsrange.blogspot.com/2012/12/power-rangers-legends-ios-game-now.html#.UMto93fNmSp
I thought the reason Derpy's voice/appearance was changed is that one of the staff has a mentally challenged kid and she didnt know what derp/derpy means and she interpreted the name/phrase to be pejorative in nature.
i love derpy
allo bronystate
really new voice not so bad
Of course I just have spina bifida and possible autism so I might not be one to talk.
yeah. the one that actually wrote her and liked her
PuddleJumper: was it Amy Keating Rogers?
The editing for the derpy scene was so half assed
i don't even see difference how it more or less offends somebody
There was no emotion in it at all
i think she is fine the way she is. Shes cute and funny and it dosent matter. They should just let her be what she is, people can think for themselves
i don't get why they even need to change it
what purpose?
it's just stupid
Again, people are way too god damn sensitive these days
are we talking about why they changed derpy's voice and slightly underped her eyes?
ouo_ewe: SO we dont "offend" the retarded people
Last night I had a dream where an animated girl spoke entirelly in that iTunes edit voice.
btw Im happy that the episode even aired. It was a glorious day for the fandom. The scene being changed doesnt take away it's glory in my book. :)
it's a gen 3.5 plushie, oh god why'
Gray Controversy was a disgrace
Alchemist: They could have put some emotion into the editing though..
the change was neccessary
There was no fucking emotion in that edit
SpadeKyurem[WoW] You're not being disrespecting of my demographic are you?
nah, it went out the original way, these days its on the net forever. so why bother
I'm watching Santa Claus Conquers the Martians MST3K right now
I mean dont get me wrong I hate the edit too.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdVrOz379AI
oh dear\
Dan vs. fim updated a bit :p
SpadeKyurem[WoW], yeah tollerate shit motherfucker... There is nothing such a bullshit in age of Doom and Blood
im not being disrespectfully at all, she can be derpy just they way they put her and it changes nothing, shes still a loveable cute char
She's not cute without the derp eyes.
Unfortunatley Soccer Moms seem to think everything offends people
mah shes fine either way, though shes cuter with derp eyes
Just like Satan is in everything new for the Pope :D
hey hey hey stay out of my shed !
They just made it more frustraiting for community and character understanding.
Just like Sweetie Belle wouldn't be cute without the curled mane.
hello once again
Its about as retarded as parents complaining people on the internet and online games are being rude to their kids
and Applebloom isn't as cute without the bow.
ITS THE FUCKING INTERNET, DUMBASS
But curls are clearly disrespectful for people with straight hair!
squeeky bell will be cute so long as she keeps squeekin
SpadeKyurem[WoW], totally agreed, why they even didn't watch for his childrens?!
I think at this point Claire IS doing it on purpose.
so lame
PuddleJumper: well her VA doesn't seem to want to stop squeaking :D
In fact in the report on that I swore I saw a kid playing fucking Halo
TheGentleManBrony: oh she is in fact
<.<
Any parent who thinks people on the internet won't be rude to you're kid is a moron
if you won't your child see some stuff, it's your duty watch for this
*your
and don't blame tv or internet
Matter afact why the fuck are you letting your 6-8 year old kid on the fucking internet
Emergency edible BOOoots
THere needs to be a way to write a squeak.
Well I have bad news, truly bad news.
Let's ask Claire to come up with one.
There was a school shooting in Conneticut
maybe Wh~at! (~squeek)
26 dead
HA
Its on the news right now otakon
CTHULHU: HA?
yes, ha.
CTHULHU: don't tell me you're actually LAUGHING about 18 CHILDREN being shot are you?
why not?
it was a Elementary School
....and the other 8 just collapsed by themselves?
Who the fuck goes into a school and shoots up a bunch of children
why not?
WHY FUCKING NOT?
CTHULHU: Go to hell
CTHULHU, you're literally the biggest retard.
I hope you burn
HOW FUCKED UP ARE YOU?
meh
otakon: 26 dead is a terrible thing, and nothing to laugh about, but why don't people react the same way about ongoing wars?
because this this isnt 4 chan. talk about this somewhere else
Get out of here you twat.
Eli: bc it's SOLDIERS, not CHILDREN that have been gunned down for NO reason
I never understand why these people do these shootings
i cant help it im really dark.
CTHULHU: well at least keep it to yourself then
otakon: it's not like there are no civilians killed in a war, right?
why
Eli: no there are not
What fucking reason does ANYONE have to go to a school and shoot up kids
WHY
otakon: that's very naive of you
CTHULHU: bc it shows that you are a sociopath that has no empathy and therefore are a potential threat to others
wait, you actually think civilians aren't killed in wars?
no
I didn't say that
Buytoast: right?
what do you believe gumdrops flying around by shooting fizzy pop out their ass?
Oh god damn it Buytoast let him finish
i aint stoppin him
but he aint finishin
it's different than just a random person walking into a SCHOOL and gunning down 10 year olds
meh.
actually Otakon u did basically say that.
verbatim
CTHULHU: I normally would never say this, but I hope you fucking die
otakon: how's that diffrent than random soldiers walking around killing 10 year olds?
well, im a veteran, ive had my fill of dead anyones...im going back to minecraft
you did say that there are not civilians killed in wars otakon
joks on you i want to die.
Dude shut the fuck up.
you literally said that they aren't, i can scroll up and screen cap it any everything boy
Eli: bc soldiers USUALLY have orders not to shoot civilians and especially children
i mean damn
Buytoast: no I didn't
Stop trying to be goth because you're desperate for attention.
Its the same mistake I made.
CTHULHU: get counseling man, really
<Eli> otakon: it's not like there are no civilians killed in a war, right?[12:13:23] <CTHULHU> why[12:13:24] <otakon> Eli: no there are not
...
otakon: riiiight... they usually turn the kids into soldiers so they can kill each other
I fuckin painted my nails and hung out at the coffee shop all the time.
c'mon man
THAT WAS A TYPO
i did dident help
SUDDENLY A TYPO
I thought I just typed no there are
Buytoast: He makes a good point
honestly in a few days this shooting will be in the back of everyone's minds
so eh
what shooting?
Wow... how insensitive can you be?
Buytoast We're still thinking about the Aurora Shooting aren't we?
something about a nutter and a school
WHO THE FUCK GOES INTO A KINDERGARDEN CLASS AND SHOOTS THE PLACE UP
WHAT PURPOUSE DO YOU HAVE DOING THIS
Alchemist: Conneticut
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: the insane
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: dude take a fuckin chill pill.
otakon: when?
Alchemist: now
seriously listening to a live report of it
havent heard about it
http://www.breakingnews.com/
ouch
i think i am going to have a concussion by the end of the day
at least 20 down
thats sad
from all the head-desking
Also it seems common 90% of the time the shooter ends up killing himself
Unless one of you has a time machine there's really no point in discussing this.
no's gonna care about this in 2 weeks
they are ALREADY talking about gun laws, gun regulations, disarming everyone, etc
I always thought Connecticut was populated entirely by uber rich white people so I've just never given a shit about Connecticut.
/me parachutes into the chat & hugs everyypony
I point to Norway
Wow...fucking insensitive much?
God you people
eh, it's just the flavor of the day
TheGentleManBrony: Im from CT and Im poor
one guy, 100 odd dead BECAUSE NO ONE HAD A FUCKING GUN TO DEFEND THEMSELVES
like that whole dark knight rises deal
Meanwhile: is right. none of us were affected, and unles you plan to start a charity for the victims, there's no point
nobody is still crying over that
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: bc they're self destructive but they are too COWARDLY to just go out themselves I would think
well, probably the family of the deceased
but in the large picture it's all but forgotten unless someone brings it up
Ryunosuke: what if... he didn't have a gun?
TheGentleManBrony: but then again I lived most of my life in Florida
let me put it this way
You could be a little less insensitive about the whole damn thing Buytoast
i could say the same thing about you gettin riled up
if guns are outlawed, the only people that are going to have guns, are criminals, and I seriously doubt criminals are going to be conserned that they are breaking gun laws
Buytoast: Well at least I actually seem to give a shit about this
yeah agreed
so it's simple
we have to DESTROY all the guns
all of them
and never make them again
OH, Lets rob a bank, but no guns, THATS ILLEGAL
really?
well why not?
destroy ALL the weapons
otakon: yep. truer words have never been spoken
can we drop this, it's geting boring now.
no guns seems to work for a lot of countries
Oryou know...get fucking security?
Alchemist: however
This chat doesn't exist for your personal amusement, if you're bored you can piss off.
those countries have a vastly different culture than the US/Canada
bite me
otakon: i used to be far right on this issue but mow I kinda agree
Alchemist: you should see switzerland. even knifes aren't allowed, and we have next to no casualties. except army weapons...
a fucking 8 year old and 11 year old HELD UP A WOMAN IN A FUCKING CHURCH PARKINGLOT
saying anti gun laws in the UK or Japan works doesnt mean we should try it in the US
SpadeKyurem[WoW] weren't you the one who five minutes ago was saying how people are too sensitive? And now you're crying your eyes out about a guy shooting some kids, even though shooting happens every day and this just happened to make it on air.
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: dear lord
Ryunosuke: why?
Eli: cultural differences
What I'm saying is you guys sound like you dont give a shit about any of this
Ryunosuke: lol... guns are culture... that's so dumb
You could at least care you know
Why should we?
not really
i dont
who said we didn't care
Ryunosuke: what differences are those exactly? I dont think US/Canadians are more vicious by nature.
we jsut aren't spazzing over another shooting
Ryunosuke: guns are culture and you wonder about a shooting in a school?
Half of these kids were probably gonna grow up to be stupid wastes of space anyway.
just because we aren't ranting and raving about how horrible this is doesn't mean we don't give two shits
TheGentleManBrony: Wow...asshole
Eli: the US has had a culture where guns are predominant, ie. revolutionary war, Westward expansion of the 1800's, sport hunting, etc.
I don't care, but talking about it still isn't going to do anything. Yes it's absolutely tragic, yes it's not something that should ever happen in a civil society, but it did and no amount of "I am torn up about this" is going to make it better.
TheGentleManBrony: hey now... don't get too offensive
okay sorry Eli.
Guns do not kill people
Nuh uh
people with guns kill people
^
they are just a tool to facilitate the process
Ryunosuke: soooo the wars are now culture and were a good thing?
gunpowder does
actually more direct, PEOPLE kill people
and who invented gunpowder?
a gun is really a tool
Guns arent the issue, its people using the damn guns
people can kill people just fine WITHOUT guns
that's right
the Chinese
same can be said about a butterknife
a tool invented for the sole purpose of killing people so that argument is FUCKING STUPID
jesus
Ryunosuke: true but not 30 at a time in 30 seconds
and what is China?
you guessed it
Communist
Nuclear option
Ryunosuke: guns just make it too easy and too quick.
So what is on later?
Oh boy here we go....
This is all a Communist plot.
Gummi: no idea, movies on tonight though
But we will stand strong.
Buytoast: communists!
if you have a bigger gun than your enemy, your enemy isnt going to want to shoot you, or have serious reservations about doing so
Buytoast: no it's not, get that conspiracy theory out of here
Anyone know the movie?
Thank you Buytoast for trying to inject levity into this discourse
Buytoast: You're over patriotic bullshit is getting old
Buytoast I still think all people who wear glasses are suspicous, I mean, Hitler had Glasses!
*your
Ryunosuke: the insrugents are heavily outgunned. that doesnt seem to stop them
Ryunosuke: we all see you're in a pro war confirmation bias. you were raised like this right?
Gummi: no it's not
eli: I would say, if you are going to kill me, do it quick and painless, or else I will be VERY pissed off
I was jk...
CAN WE ALL JUST CALM THE FUCK DOWN?!
0,5Everything alright in here?
ohai BaconMane
yes yes
Ryunosuke: problem is just i'm not gonna kill anyone.
Everythig is terrible.
BaconMane: all cool
BACOOOOOOOOON GOTTA GET SOME BACOOON
BaconMane: HELP... US....!!!!
Buytoast shut up
this is fun
We're all ifne.
niether am i
CUTHULU
:D
Just this bleeding heart asshole who likes an outdated game won't shut up
Love it
what??
i will if i have to, i have no reservations about that, i would just rather not have to
I love cuthulu
TheGentleManBrony: I would so love ot hear you say that those dead children would grow up to be a waste of space to the parents of those kids
love you too
0,5Everyone calm the fuck down.
OH GOD OH GOD *grabs paper bag*
/me lol'd
well...that was effective :D

Yeah so okay.

0,5TheGentleManBrony, Cthulu, etc, I'm keeping my eyes on you. And anyone else who was being a dousche over this.
I dont think I've ever owned an apple product.
05mer eller mindre
I wasn't being a douche. I said one douchey thing.

ohai wrek

im a asshole not a dousche
(insert meme here)
Ryunosuke I guess that that's what they were going fore... but seriously, I would prefer iJobs over jObs
TheGentleManBrony: Which could be the worst thing you could say to parents who lost their kids...asshole
0,5Keep it up, my trigger finger is itchy.
Enough already.
0,5Or in this case, my boot.
/me is shot by BaconMane
let me ask this eli, is it okay to play CoD, PS2, Halo or any other FPS that simulates a combat situation? :)
Babs seed a bully and a bitch babs seed babs seed
SpadeKyurem[WoW] U think I'm gonna actually do that? I'm not goin to Connecticut.
great song
ever
i'm not gonna write "is kicked" ...
and i am being civil
0,5Stop talking about it, now.
Fuck
now I want bacon
Ryunosuke: I don't. but if you want to... do it. can't stop you
0,5Enough.
(insert crudely drawn pen15 here)
power man
so
What is the movie
Gladiator
And Mars Attacks!
Yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Seen mars, but what about gladiator?
Nice.
dunno, never watched all of it
Buytoast: that one is Tim burton right?
Ok I didn't know singing was spam.
watching the trailer now
hell if I know
Eli: I think so
0,5It was the speed of your messages, obviously.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en-GB&v=IvTT29cavKo

otakon: but without Johnny Depp
/me pets BaconMane
hi friend :)
Looks good!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaI7cy5OLAM
I think I like the music of Gladiator more than the movie itself :)
GREATEST SONG EVER
Alchemist: stealth bunny suit Fluttershy?
THANKYOU FOR LINKING THAT
05so ofc you love it
otakon: yesh
Oh snap it's friday isn't it.
:D::D:D::D
eeyup Meanwhile
ITS FRIDAY
FRIDAY
yeah not going further
Fucking forgot.
GOTTA GET DAOWN OR FRIIDDAAYYY
Wrek: I like everything he does practically
Wrek I think it's strange that he only got 1 Oscar in his career. For the Lion King Soundtrack
I think that trailer is fake tho... Gummi
^
Meanwhile, 'least you didn't fall asleep while doing the survey
he is. he could even convert me to classical
although sometimes I think he has to much of always the same elements
Heeere branches branches branches
SpeccyRush: Skills.
there was
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgTuOvX3zgg
Branches
CTHULHU: no for this year
Gummi: I dont think so. We already had one and I dont think they play the same card twice.
that was last years
Branches are best pony
Branches?
I vote for pony named branches
oh then no
Lil_B: Yeah, people can hate COD:MW2 all they like, the theme was still awesome.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AohFNsu-pWA
he worked on Modern Warfire 2, Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure
Alchemist: that's what I like to say about FFXIII
Alchemist I like that they got some Indie-Game Music Guys in the Blacvk-Ops II Soundtrack
COD? Maybe you meen ME3
Eli: I only played FF4 and I didnt complete it.
F*ck yeah to Sonic themes
A good theme doesnt nessicarily make a game good
Sonic 06 had good music, it was still shit
I will admit that Sonic does usually have GREAT music
ouo_ewe: he made the theme for me, cod, crysis 2
Alchemist: the FF music is quite epic in all of them. you should check it out
5 hours till the movie?
wow -_-
Well, the FF13 and 13-2 Music is... well produced, but I can't find some charm in it :/
I'll be in bed by that time.
05i might aswell stream something then
Gummi: i take it you're from europe too then?
Live and Learn is best Sonic music
yes
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: thats true, but people usually go all in and if they jump on the hate bandwagon they know no boundaries.
yet all of you speak english
si
Gummi: duh.
Well i guess i'm the only kid
:/
Sonic 06 is the only game that anyone can hate and I have no qualms about it
usually dissapointing things have good music
Gummi: Ich könnte schon Deutsch reden, but that would suck
like Sticker Star
Buytoast: Fuck you
oh look MUSIC STREAM GO!
05SpadeKyurem[WoW]: behave
Yes Sir.
Well i'm off now
Buytoast no, xD good m,usic in good games just gets outshined and overlooked by other things :)
Any last words?
bye Gummi see you later
bye Gummi ?
bye
Lol k
yay Wrek stream
aaaand gone :/
Who endad with GTA IV?
freakin youtube keeps changing my settings :[
Wrek these guys are so good live XD

Alchemist I hate that I can't change the startup page the way I want >.<

THEATHER SUCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!
hello there Chrysalis !
Eli me too, not my Style, but they are food :)
Lil_B: ...food?
Lil_B: not to mention that the design itself is bland, almost looks amateurish.
power metal is best metal
heya Lil_B
Lil_B: typos that make sense are best typos
got 3 Pings I I pressed the "page back" button >.< I must disable them if possible
hey Wrek did you see what i got from seeing these live?
05nope
05and im pissed
Eli Sabaton is best food
05casue the ticekts when they played here in umeå were sold out
05like
Chrysalis: bruises?
05the isntance they went on sale
BTW talking about epic music; I just stumbled over two steps from hell. I love it so far. :)
Wrek you know how he always wears those aviators...
05aye
05why do you think i got my own pair Chrysalis?`:P
have you seen he likes to throw them into the crows
crowd*
Alchemist found them 1 month ago when "Skylands" or what their new Album's Name is, came out
http://e621.net/data/50/91/509160283664372032aad87d4af93539.png?1355440257
Hey all.
Oh look, Wrek Sessions.
http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/KseiVO.jpg
hiya Chrysalis
Alchemist isntandly "bought" all Albums from the Piratebay for a "low-price"
got his glasses as he threw them :D
05haha
05awesome :D
05also
I am feeling very good today.
ikr
How about everyone else?
05ouo_ewe: no more saucy
meh
Lil_B: I "bought" my copy via a third party software from youtube :)
Wrek, you used to stream video games on the stream, as far as I remember when I last came here.
Alchemist ahhh xD I used to do that 2 years ago, but the Quality Loss I get via Youtube compression and downloading that is something I wanted to start avoiding :)
Wrek Isn't E621 very not to be linked unless you only got the image and not a said page like that?
Mattcrowley2a, he does Planetside sometimes
Mattcrowley2a: they all stream various things. Wrek sometimes streams games and sometimes the most amazing art
Thanks, both of you.
dat metal
Mattcrowley2a: and sometimes somethinglike that
Lil_B: many people say that the quality is mediocre at best. Luckily for me I dont have a good ear for music and I dont really hear the difference :D
05killerpony7733: it was still a safe image
Alchemist: Me neither, hehe :D
nothing can beat the feeling of a good guitar solo
btw what band is this?
Sabaton
I can play around with the presets in the media player (equalizer, effects etc) and it sounds good enough for me.
Dat headbang!
we need some blind guardian
Alchemist My Setup isn't the best eather, but I alöso just dislike the way I had to copy and paste ALL the Links there one-by-one and when it stopped on one song, I could repeat everything :/
Looks like a concert actively going.
Lil_B: you couldnt make a playlist of the downloaded songs?
/me missed school :'(
http://derpiboo.ru/182646
Alchemist that would also have taken rather long, I'm just better of finding the Album I want somewhere else and downloading it
ouo_ewe: thats slightly odd :D
05forgot to hide the 18 tag
yeup i think so.. :)
Ooo concert! Who are these guys Wrek?
nothing better to do
Sabaton
Wrek, how have you been?
Welp thanks oh powerful CTHULHU! :D
Oh, I thought the metal was for 18+
no prob

Lil_B: Aaah. I haven't heard any of the entried from RW5 tbh. I can't seem to find them on YouTube or I haven't been looking hard enough

Howdy MLP_Brovakiin!
Hm, Par looks a bit heavier in this show, Wrek.
05i want to sleep
05but i promised to planetside 2 tonight
05solution: loud metal and coffee
Invi U here?
Wrek: :).
Wrek: Howdy by the way!
Lil_B, yo dude ^^
LOUUUUD METAAALLLLL
05heyo
Aloa Everlasting_Joy !
Howdy Lil_B!
remember bobby's world? IT WAS A GOOD SHOW
Invi I just eccetentally found something!"
You are too young to remember. IT WAS A GOOD SHOW
Lil_B, wat?
05this part of this song
05so awesome
meh
Invi A 15min talk, with GEMA and Youtube Persons about why they don't get along with it, finally, I hope I'll get answers!
Invi in german!
Lil_B, since GEMA is a only german instutute: duh german ^^
Invi still! I'm happy!
I am the true Record_Discord
Previously known as Trollestia
Lil_B, I don't want answers, I want it to go away and stop bullying the public media :<
Cool story bro
Invi JA!
cachi01|phone: You know it
really a keytar?
05mhm
thats not metal
Is this Stalingrad?
Lil_B... are you tryin to tell me that it is leaving youtube alone?
And welcome to power metal CTHULHU
Invi no... unfortunatly :/
is there hope in the future?
Stalingrad wat
not a lot of power metal band use keytars
CTHULHU: ...And?
05probably why sabaton are so damned good
Well this one does
just saying
http://e621.net/data/4c/92/4c92565980a422dcb01cdbc713c91ef3.png?1347231077
Well, different. That's what they are.
Well this one does
CTHULHU: I'd like to disagree with you.
bbl, Dragonborn is calling me
Deal with it
Invi can't say yet... ... damn, its more than 30 min of talking... and probably still no solution at the end :/
I have never seen a band that loves their fans so much, and puts so much fun and effort into their shows.
blind guardian is better
Well that's your opinion.
^
wat i did now?!
otakon i need to play that dlc. I've only seen my brother playing it
05CTHULHU: really you gona pull that old cliche?
05*sigh*
cachi01|phone: it's pretty good
Lil_B, well GEMA is a political institution; meaning: much talk, no meaning, no action
okay out for now
what cliche?
And they are fan fucking tastic.
Invi nope, there is action, it's just the wrong action
05the "X is better."
05it doesnt matter
13but
13wub is better
Butt
Lil_B, what are they going to do?
05or atleast is redundant
13canary knows this :3
Wut
Invi I stopped listening to it now, it's incedebly boring :/
05best song
05ever
OOOH OOH OOH OOH
metal over wub, but i do like wub
05on their older albums
05by FAR
Invi instead I finally found what I was searching for all along: Soundtrack_Cologne: East meets West
Invi Part 1: Starfox and Starfox 64 /me goes insane
:D
Thousands of feet march to the beat~
It's an army on the march

13and that's all i remember
13tolkien is DENSE writing... the man never heard of paragraph breaks it seems...
