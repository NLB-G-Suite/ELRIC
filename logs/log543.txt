JRP2234: This is one of my all-time favorite games. It really requires a lot of thought to beat the first time you play it (as long as you don't use a walkthrough or anything like that)
Hello every one :)
Hey Cow334
o hai bronystate
im back
hi
What are we playing today?
Phase4 is playing RealMyst
Hello every one how are you all
hi cow334
00,02soo much word
00,02i'm sure this game is epic interesting and i should read all this
00,02but its soo much
00,02and i want to be solving puzles
Twilight Sparkle would like this game lawl
A lot of it is backstory to areas you'll visit later in the game, while some other parts of it (mainly the diagrams) will help out with puzzles.
Phase4: mabey you should read it when like you are getting into the game
00,02i figure some of this is for puzles
Phase4: Stragtey game I'm guessing then?
Shit that's alot of reading
Adventure/puzzle, cow334
00,02cow334, not a clue
How many books do you have to read?
Technically, you don't have to actually read any of them. Most of the books are burned, anyway.
There's only like 5 or 6 books in the library there that are intact.
OtakuTom: oh thanks
Why are they burned?
It's part of the story
Phase4: hmmm so you bought a game and you dont even know what the plat form is
lawl
00,02cow334, i've been told for a long time its good
00,02Shizuka recomended it
00,02must be something here
Phase4: It looks good but it also looks confuesing at the same time
00,02i am intrigued, but its a little much right now
00,02yeah
Is there enemies?
I said it a little earlier...this is one of my all-time favorite games. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good thinking game.
There's no enemies.
No time limit
Phase4: can you please tell me what the game is called
00,02realMyst
cow334: It's called Myst. The version Phase is playing is called realMyst
Is this game on ps3?
The original game came out in 1993 for PC CD-ROM
OtakuTom: wow even the name sounds confuesing
pc only?
It's been remade a number of times, including for handhelds.
There's no major console release (PS3, 360)
Is there any enemys on the game
no
There's no enemies. It's just you and the puzzles.
So whats the story?
Trying to find treasure?
Your character comes across a book with the title 'Myst'. Inside the book is a moving picture. When you put your hand on the picture, you are transported to this island.
HIYA EVERYPONY WAKE UP
So your trying to escape the island?
Hi Bronysithj
Phase4: from what u have just read about this game it has a HUGE history of versions and it looks real confuesing if you want to get into of this game you need to like no what is going on
From there, you have to discover the secrets behind the island, the writer of the Myst book, named Atrus, and his 2 sons, Sirrus and Achenar
Phase4: sorry i meant from what i just read
/me glomps Phase4
/me 00,02hugs Bronysith back
00,02stream working ok?
hai Bronysith
How are you tofay
The stream's been cutting in and out a little bit, but it's stable now.
Did you guys see the video about the guys threatining to kill a guy if there is no summer sale?
cow334: im good
00,02i have no clue if these levers do anything
Bronysith: awesome
Phase4 idk if it's fake or not
Everything you can interact with on the island is there for a reason. You need to figure out what they do.
I saw it on reddit
I'll be right bacl
back
im the only one who saw it?
ok then...
The tower rotation doesn't do anything for being able to access certain things. It will, however, give you clues as to the 4 locations it points to where the lines turn red.
OtakuTom Did you already beat this game?
Years ago. I've had Myst since it first came out back in 1993.
wow
Phase4:
l4d2 should work now
00,02i'm playing myst
NO
Lawl
YOUR PLAYING L4D2
spiderman.avi
Phase4: did you take the rasins
00,02??????????????????
Is...is that a rocket ship?
Phase4: make a program that turns the text here in to mssam voice
[wklmjhe]JRP2234 LFD1 is better
Phase4: ill give you cake
i dont has l4d1
Phase4: Do you want to know the secret to the elevator in the library?
[wklmjhe]JRP2234 Buy it
[wklmjhe]JRP2234 it's FUN!
It won't ruin anything else other than how to access more clues.
:D
Try 1337
i got it from new zealand to avoid the nerfed version
00,02OtakuTom, nope
ima go watch Ashens now
bye!
Oh look a dentist chair, I'll just sit in it.
hey there
Hey BrOnyxia
whats this? ;o
00,02enter number of marker switches
00,02i counted 7 or 8
00,02keep getting confused about that one
00,02BrOnyxia, realMyst
I hate to break it to you, but that's not the imager...
00,02OtakuTom, well that sucks
Phase4: ic thx
Whatever it is, it was cool.
my name is purple in his chat
lol
ugh, what a terrible dream.
;o?
I dreamt that I didn't get a newsletter email.
buwah, my OC re-colouring got added as a favourite by someone?
my worst dream was when i ordered the rd t-shirt .. i dreamt that i got it but it was messed up and i didnt like it
/me glomps Chrysalis
lol
What is this?
but it was awesome
:D
Phase4: l4d2 plz
TheRandomkid321: realMyst
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, no
Phase4: yes
00,02i *might* need a clue
00,02OtakuTom, the crap is the imager?
SOMEONE GOT A PICTURE OF ME!!! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3380/
I am a few seconds behind... not big deal.
Bronysith :D
The imager is right by where you started out on the dock. You almost walked into it a little earlier.
It's behind a door you didn't click on.
/me shreds Chrysalis s cheese legs into nachos
wtf
hoofs
not legs
Bronysith: dats not you
sith, you are messed up
hoofs
hooves*
hooves
ty Rain
TIME FOR PONYS
lawl
looks like a hard game
cow334: that is a pic of me
Bronysith: prove that its you
[wklmjhe]JRP2234: do you not know what the hell a joke is?
muffins
Bronysith: really?
BrOnyxia: it's nearly 20 years old, and is still one of the best games out there. It just requires a lot of thinking and exploration.
00,02well
00,02that did not help
00,02OtakuTom, its age shows
OtakuTom: yeah seems LO
:P *
There's a panel in there to enter the number of marker switches, Phase4. You have to find it...maybe you missed a button on the wall...(hint hint)
00,02holy crap thats small
00,02dats not fair
lol
WTF http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4341/
lololol
/me eats Phase4 s computer
I still think this game is better as point-and-click. There's so many things you can miss in this version by having free movement.
Today I made a snadvich... I went and bought everything I thought I needed. I went home, made one and ate it. And I thought surely this is not capable of restoring THAT much hp... Then I realised I forgot the new meat... Then I realised that I had made a vegetarian sandvich... then I realised I use ... way too much.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4808/ me when season 3 is released
i have some ambitions for s3
i got disconnected
:<
/me eats cow334
And did any one go to bronycon?
Bronysith: O-O you cant eat me silly filly
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1978/
bronycon appaarnt suck
oh god lol
um....okay then http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2432/
LOL
Bronysith: xD
Are you crazy ? Ill never go to bronycon , as cons go , after the huge success this time thees probably gonna be a fire every con now.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1023/
00,02i just want to check
00,02OtakuTom, do those switches EVER do anything
CELESTIA ONLY HAS 1 EYE
The marker switches? Yes.
00,02ok
00,02damn
00,02that throws that theory out the door
lel
/me throws Phase4 s theory out the door
I hate trying to be vague...lol
IF ONLY! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1927/
Phase4: do u like dubstep?
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, depends
o.0
i need a yes or nno
Any time I watch someone play this game, I just want to tell them everything about the island...not even the other areas of the game, just the secrets of Myst island, Atrus, Sirrus, and Achenar...lol
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, i like good dubstep, not bad dubstep
00,02OtakuTom, dont
[wklmjhe]JRP2234: every single dubstep song sounds exactlly the same
I'm being good, Phase :P
Phase4: o-o where are you right now in the game?
i attempted dubstep
00,02Bronysith, not every single one
00,02the few good ones are good
Like DANM you be in a nother demension
00,02i think i see
i dun like dubstep that much unless there are ponies involved
xD
this is Phase4 trying to figure out the game http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4756/
lol
D:
/me hugs Bronysith
/me glomps VioletGreySha
doesnt look like a 20 year old game
00,02do those marker switches are for the tower rotation
00,02Bronysith, ikr
They sure are
Bronysith: :3
Phase4: http://soundcloud.com/jrp2234/its-all-lies-jrp2234 i made crap omg
THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2225/
realMyst isn't 20 years old. This is a remake that was made to allow for full movement in the world. The original was a point-and-click...basically a complicated powerpoint or hyperstudio presentation.
hi everyone
ey Lil_B
Hey Lil_b
hiya Lil_B
thanks BrOnyxia OtakuTom and Bronysith :)

hello Vacation_Wrek dat delayed reaciton
hello Vacation_Wrek
I'm trying to remember if the old version had the metronome...haha...I think it was there, and I'm pretty sure you had to play it in time.
00,02well shit
00,02thats gona be a pain
lol
My speedruns ignore all of that, 'cause I know all the secrets and can skip to the end...lol
Phase4: http://fav.me/d54m684

That picture looks awesome
Ooooh...I remember now...
Yea...he's got it.
lawl i like trolling people on call of duty
Don't you hate it when you wake up with one of your own hairs in your mouth?
FairysHuff|KeepsFall: yup
*YAWN*
WAIT .... no that dosent happen to me
cow334: You must not have long hair
FairysHuff|Sleepy: well i do but i dont no how long are you talking about

cow334: Mine is past my shoulders.
....O-O wow

hai everypony :3
Phase 4: Welcome to the Spaceship Age
hi Spell-of-Gaming
hai Spell-of-Gaming
cow334: Not really. I died my hair something like 8 years ago and now it's falling out ^_^ Not very strong at all. Bald patch on crown.
*dyed
FairysHuff|Sleepy: sorry about that
cow334: Meh, it happens to most men. No point whining about it.
FairysHuff|Sleepy unlikely to have been the dye
FairysHuff|Sleepy: i guess then my hair is nice and smooth i liek it
Dumori: Never know. I had to have it bleached first
yeah
but 8 years is a tad on the long side
Dumori: Well it's been slowly falling out over that time.
it should be much more imediate if you ruin folicals that badly
Phase4: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0PdRBxCGbBZ best tut
Dumori: Well if thats so then I guess it must be genetic.
00,02well, this is interesting
On the topic of Dyeing hair
00,02different island
I would shave my head and be done with it but you just know some idiots are going to mistake me for some right wing racist just because of that.
00,02i think this is the stone something age the book refered too
I'm fighting the urge to dye mine two tone electric blue
FairysHuff|Sleepy where do you live?
i would want to die my hair but then i dont want to risk any thing
Dumori: When I dyed mine I dyed it shocking pink with deep blue 2 inch ends. ^_^
the shaved guy due to bolding is quite common here
Dumori: Scotland.
Ah
I'm S. Yorkshire
Hi everypony
hai Starlight_Phoenix
hallo
Hey Starlight_Phoenix
Whats happening here this fine day?
Dumori: You know how society is. I'd have much better luck finding work if I had hair rather than a skin head. O_o Society has strange views on appearance.
/me glomps FairysHuff|Sleepy
Socity can go fuck it's self tbh
Bronysith: *Cuddles and nuzzles* ^_^
Dumori: Yup.
it's a cretin
and a bigot
hai everybody, whats going on tonight?
What game is playing on the stream?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1559/
Starlight_Phoenix: myst
grrr
Which myst?
i wonder what yahtzee is going to review this week
Phase4: i should live stream u playing while i comemtate
00,02Starlight_Phoenix, realMyst

04Nothing much, think I'm gonna get some sleep though...I'm kinda tired

04Tired
Just two weeks till my birthday... Wonder what I should do for it...
Well later then ghosties..... sweet dreams

Ghosties: Sleeps wells
04See ya later

night ghos ahh he gone
night ghost
in and out
now im hungray
I suppose I could go to the Edinburgh Museum. Haven't been since it re-opened.
00,02there is a LOT going on in this game
00,02gona get some food, brb
:O what is this?
MadSurge: realMyst
Phase4: by alot you mean a bunch of junk, or a little bit of junk stretched out over a few hours?
MadSurge: Dude, wheres my crack pipe
FairysHuff|Sleepy: far out, dude
>mfw I heard "Staryu" in "Star U.S. Swimmer."
StupidSexyCJ: Once you discover what's going on how to go about the game, it can go by quickly. It's a matter of finding out everything and working out the puzzles.
OtakuTom: so a little form column A, a little from column B?
Yea, more or less.
Anyone have any ideas on helping me become more awake? O_o No caffeine though. Makes my heart rattle around inside my ribcage.
Once you know the final solution to the game, it can actually be beaten in a matter of minutes, which kinda ruins consecutive playthroughs. I speedrun the game now probably once a year, but since I can beat it so quickly, I've forgotten a lot of the puzzles.
FairysHuff|Sleepy: hhmmm well i dont get tired at all i recomend just getting a cooled bucket of water and just throwing your face in it
FairysHuff|Sleepy: (1 find a bear (2 poke it (3 ???? (4 Awake forever
it will work trust me
StupidSexyCJ: lawl
cow334: Tried that. Only wakes me for a few minutes.
FairysHuff|Sleepy: oh well hmm ill think of ideas and i will tell you when i am done kk?
StupidSexyCJ: Tried that. The bear liked it and just lay there.
StupidSexyCJ: Now we're a couple
FairysHuff|Sleepy: congratulations
/me sits on FairysHuff|Sleepy

Phase4: Like hmm like i want to know what am i so post to upgrade for my computer to make it load and play games much faster?
Yeh, they stopped making serious stuff
00,02cow334, storage, get an ssd if load times are your concern
It seems like you've got the idea for this island down, Phase. Now you just have to use it. I actually have to go for a bit, but I'll be back in about 90 minutes.
Heya everypony.

Irish_Pony: in the words of the medic "I HAVE NO IDEA"
If i where to buy this computer would it be able to play all the games i want and would i be able to upgrade it any time i want to make it play even better ? http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/shop/pcs/alienware-x51
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/24434127647/trolldadcomic-troll-dad-dinner-time

http://trollfacecomic.com/post/24428815980/r-i-p-andrew-khil-aka-trololo-guy-1934-2012
cow334: a alienware ? yes,alienware is the best pc for games
00,02there is nothing else like this game
Bronysith: haha true :D
sergio_scriptor: and i could upgrade it any time i want right?
like the core and stuff
cow334: i guess so,but im not sure about it
sergio_scriptor: oh but other then all of it if i where to buy it would it be able to play most games i would want it to?
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/25889059448/close-enough
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m52fg2oQQO1qf087qo1_1280.jpg
like skyrim portal tf2 lfd and more?
cow334: you could play any gmae,no mattter how powerrfull it would be
http://fav.me/d4v1tje FUCKING BUBBLES
sergio_scriptor: so that is a ultimate gameing computer?
cow334: take away skyrim and you got some good games
cow334: yes
AWESOME
cow334: for games there is nothing better then an alienware
sergio_scriptor: except a custom pc
Bronysith: skyrim is okay
sergio_scriptor, except a home/self made pc
cow334: nowhere as awesome as morrowing or oblivion
sergio_scriptor: awesome
cow334: it just has good graphics. THAT IS IT
Bronysith: indeeeed :) one of this days when i got more money i will order a pc bathed in silver
Bronysith: what do you mean?
Phase4: do you even you yourself know what the hell is going on?
sergio_scriptor: i have an awesome gaming pc that is like... 1500 bucks and i enjoy it very much
Bronysith: is it custom made ?
cow334: skyrim is the worst elder scrolls game
sergio_scriptor: yup
Bronysith: nice :) mine is an acer :'(
Bronysith: oh i thought you meant the computer i was like i dont want to get it then
sergio_scriptor: i have acer monitors
00,02Irish_Pony, nope
Bronysith: skyrim is awesome well to me
Wored a little on Art of the dress, Uploaded it to youtube, I think thats enough for now :)
00,02Irish_Pony, thats the beauty of it'
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/24353731067/trollface-close-enough
00,02its like discovering
Bronysith: so the computer is good right
cow334: yes it is
Phase4: if i were to buy this would i be able to play all the game i buy for it
http://fav.me/d55v3s5
cow334: what? alienware is okay for a pre built pc i guess. but skyrim is just like a vast ocean that is 1 inch deep. pretty, but no depth
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/shop/pcs/alienware-x51
Brony-FOREVER: hmm well to you i guess
00,02cow334, its a midrange desktop
sergio_scriptor: thanks for helping me out
cow334: and it is in no way difficult. so it is boring
cow334: no problem
Phase4: But i would be able to upgrade the cpu memory and stuff like that right?
00,02should run most games, dont expect to run the latest stuff at full though
00,02most likley overpriced
00,02cow334, dont worry too much about that
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/24330088999/science-class
00,02upgrades are all fine and good, but in practice you'll spend more upgrading then buying a new machine when the old one needs to be replaced
Phase4: oh well if i buythe computer i should just not worry about the stuff until it is actually needed then that us when i start to upgrade it
better you buy now cow334 the later you will need to upgrade/replace
Bronysith: what is your opinion on fallout ?
sergio_scriptor: ...
d3rb: okay
08,01it was a wonderful day at BronyCon
Bronysith: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4u9wzrciV1qf087qo1_1280.png
08,01but everything changed
sergio_scriptor: one of the best games i have ever played

08,01all i can say is this
08,01I AM SO. GLAD. WE DIDN'T CHOOSE LONDON FOR BUCK.

08,01god, i hate london
08,01i hate london so much
ONE PIECE OST FTW
08,01i will love and tolerate that whole city into the frakking sea
08,01cow334: cool news about the computer, btw
Bronysith: nope yur wrong
[wklmjhe]JRP2234: what?
08,01sergio_scriptor: it's not brits, it's just londoners
08,01possible southerners in general
Irish_Pony, i resent that
Irish_Pony: exept for mine(portugal) algarve is the best part :)
wait...no idont, tasmania is our south......screw the south
00,02cow334, the past few years, boards have changed faster than its worth upgrading for
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4yeu01GgR1qf087qo1_1280.png
00,02cow334, by the time its worth upgrading, cpu's were for a new board and your old one wouldnt take them
00,02i imagine the next few years will probably be the same
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/23926838481/on-the-8th-day
Bronysith: i was about to send that too xD
00,02then again, they're up to 1.3k pins and those changers were mostly to remove that problem
VioletGreySha: i love this site
its very lol
Phase4: computers are already at there peak with speed

00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, lolnope

Phase4: now?
00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, computers will continue to double every 2 years for the forseeable future
nice VioletGreySha
00,02and then superconductors will be discovered and suddenly 100x more powerfull
seems software seems to be the bottleneck for pcs atm
Phase4: now?
00,02>adventure time wiki
00,02>pony pictures
00,02lolwut
Phase4: well the "mesmerino" is going to be reales to public next year,so expect computers to increase their power by at least 10x :)
Phase4 I want my next PC will have the Ivy-Bridge, which is a Tri-Gate, do you think I need a big Cooler for the CPU when I only Game on my PC and make music?
00,02Lil_B, cpu's come with a cooler
Bronysith: nope :3
00,02as long as theres enough ventilation it'll be fine
some high end intel ones dont...go figure
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4e3phnLNQ1qf087qo1_1280.jpg
Phase4 I know, but sometimes the producers cheap out and it would be better to replace them
Phase4: l4d2?
God I hate Adventure Time :P
00,02d3rb, well if you're actually buying one of those its reasonable to expect you to understand coolers

And now, a break from insanity
08,01i'm getting ready for work, and literally the only thing she does for 30 fucking minutes is to follow me around complaining about things i've done 10 years ago and how much of a bad son i was
So tell her to bugger off.
With all due respect, of course.
08,01i did!
And she didn't?
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/18053419988/funny-comic
08,01she did not!
/me 08,01hugs User0
Scoot-Scootaloo: Ever seen the OVA of Hellsing? ;)
08,01Bronysith: it's fine, i'll just throw a bunch of rubber snakes at her
sergio_scriptor: if you tell your child that he or she was a failure, you do NOT want 'what is best for the child'. If you do that, you are a git.
08,01she's terrified of them
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzrzp2XGRj1r72kajo1_1280.jpg
/me has a troll face
08,01Bronysith: my brother once made her pee herself with fear, literally
08,01with rubber snakes
That sounds terrible.
...charming.
Lasharus: probable she said that so that he did not make the same mistakes again :)
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/18052458982/true-love
I find that unlikely sergio_scriptor.
sergio_scriptor: From 10 years ago?
Again, reminding someone of a mistake is one thing. Telling them they're a failure as a son is another altogether, and an immense dick-move.
^
08,01MadSurge: in the kitchen as well!
and, Don't die, dying is bad
great god damn song, Scoot-Scootaloo
sergio_scriptor: that's what I always tell myself

08,01sergio_scriptor: yeah, she does, she just is also forthright and headstrong
08,01and doesn't acknowledge the fact that i am my own autonomous, thinking entity
08,01indeed
08,01i did the worst thing the other day, though
RAAAH!!
08,01i got so pissed off with her that i shouted at her "stop being to fucking indian!"
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzplu2JPiw1qlja77o1_1280.jpg
08,01and was a bad argument after that
08,01real bad
08,01but we made up in the end
08,01honestly, i never get angry with anyone

Kammerjunk|Bday: :D
Everlasting_Joy: look at them sternly and threaten no treats for a week? :$

Kammerjunk|Bday: im 15 and i will make 16 in november :)
killerpony7733: remember, just because you can legally do it doesn't mean it is a good idea...
Dken2021: Thanks. Sure am. Finally free of Apple.

User0: I'm really just joking around :P there isn't too much to turning 18 here except gaining adulthood and full control of your life

sergio_scriptor: I'm not surprised, that is the worst temple in the game.
Ah.
Isnt the water temple the worst?
Spade-Magnes[R]: yep
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
How does link survive high falls and not break his legs?
water temple's the reason I haven't finish the game yet
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
/me the water temples not that hard >_>
Spade-Magnes[R]: Magic
Link's legs would explode on impact
or at least shatter into a million pieces
XD
Dken2021: me too
Darn, I have a status meeting in 3 minutes...

Everlasting_Joy: yeah, but still...
Sylandest: No, I agree with you, they are disturbing.
I always wonder how Link manages to make the items float in the air when he takes them out of a chest.
Oh and inb4 magic.
Everlasting_Joy: makes sense though. Shadow temple and all that

Oh cool! Were you the girl?

FMAB was awesome
japanese don't know shit about reality
but still more than the westerners
Dermathil: Japanese ftw.
indeed
* derpy_pony
i suffer from truman sindrome so reality for me is a reality tv show :|
Dermathil: wrong ping:P
Dermathil: if your talking about the short girl in black no, shes my friend i was the dude in the Brony shirt with glasses and a black napsack
still awesome
oh cool!
Glad to meet you there then
SOUL EATER
the music makes everything cool
Pain
I sense epicness
Dermathil: like wise, sorry if i seemed a bit indifferent was tired from the day
Pain is one awesome character
The naruto sucks
Dermathil: why.
It lasted WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too long
twilight_sprinkle: flashback flashback flashback
Too much filler
longer than bleach combined?
Dermathil: so it automatically sucks then?
Dermathil: all fo it?
You could...skip the filler
/me goes back to watching Naruto
Oh god.......
Dermathil: still more creative than bleach
Scoot-Scootaloo: can we later watch scrubs ? :)
Bleach sucks too
Dermathil: Naruto may have gotten repeptetive, but not all of it sucks.
oh look, catcher freeman
Gordon Freeman vs Morgan Freeman would be epic
Dermathil: and Pain is one of the best characters in any anime.
heh
Dken2021: It's "CatchAH Freeman"
nigga ? :O
sergio_scriptor: you must be new to scoots sctreams
Catcher Freeman. Man life was hard for us before Lincolncare
twilight_sprinkle: im not,but you never lose hope of something diferent :)
pretty sure the characters of FMAB are all better than Pain<
what the
is it just me or is the audio derping?
ENOUGH OF THE ANIME FLAME WAR
Dermathil: i dont know what FMAB is, but very few characters are as deep as Pain, and his view on life is actually realistic and interesting
00,03refreshing
everyone is alowed to have their own opinion on what anime they like
Kumagawa is better than all of them (admittedly Medaka Box is too clever for its own good)
08,01okay, i need to decide how i'm going to do my hair for this cosplay
08,01should i go with a wig or dyes?
I sense some hidden racism here
twilight_sprinkle: FMAB is fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. Watch that thing. 64 episodes of awesome.
08,01Bronysith: pinkie pie cosplaying rianbow dash?
:D
08,01Dermathil: thing is, my hair is naturally curly
while we are here...
memont
Dermathil: gurren lagann is 27 episodes of amazinblesness
08,01so that'd be hilarious
moment
got for dyes then
poor donald faison.
Bronysith: TTGL is badass brah
Dermathil: YES /)
i like that black guy
I always say that. Got a TTMLP poster from bronycon
/)
God damn it audio quit derping
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsqjfkXNQr1qa4x8wo1_500.jpg this....who the fuck did this? and let the press take it?
dat pinkie

derpy_pony: looks like Bronycon January 2012
*legit
:S :S :S :S :S :S :S :S :S :S :S :S
08,01but should i do actual dyes, or spray-in dyes?
there wasn't any wood like that over there
I assumed it were the last bronycon
I'm bored. What should I do?
08,01the good thing about natural dyes is that it would mean i could have it all ready before the con
08,01Dermathil: it's already pink
FairysHuff|Eating: stay at bronystate ? :$
FLASHIER PINK
FairysHuff|Eating eat?
sergio_scriptor: I'm already here. I always leave the chat on now.

AttackPony: Nope, that's just you.
Kammerjunk well it is one of the first lost episode creepy pastas
How long until a MLP lost episode creepypasta? :D
AttackPony using head phones?
AttackPony nope, no tiny voices
Kammerjunk: I don't think it's just me

Barbetos|Atwork: No, not yet
MadSurge: I'll bet you 5 bucks one already exists.

AttackPony: You're right. It's not just you. It's outside.
oh... god... dear god... :'( *faints*
They're coming for you, AttackPony.
There is no place to hide.
Kammerjunk: Creepy
I know many of you dont agree but also find scp-087 creepy (the never ending staircase)
Kammerjunk: OH MOLESTIA, HELP
looks good CrimsonPhoenix
I need somepony... to hold me...
Alchemist: That is a creepy staircase indeed. Have you tried SCP-173?
Did Scoots just laugh?
/me holds Kipkat07_USAF

/me clings tightly to Meanwhile
Scoot-Scootaloo: IHATEYOUIHATEYOUIHATEYOUIHATEYOUIHATEYOUIHATEYOU *sobs*
Attackpony: I havent played any of the games, just read the stories and saw lets plays.
BAATS! BAAATS IN MY FACE!
Scoots is barely holding back laughter.
who was phone
Scoot-Scootaloo: Im sorry...
THEN WHO WAS PHONE
Lil_B, Sorry to assume such fact, it just seemed that way with what you wrote
Alchemist: Let's play of SCP-173...creepy as shit
/me hugs Kiphat07_USAF
/me cries
And that's the last we ever heard from Scoot-Scootaloo
ok, that was creepy
If I had stream up I might know what just happened.
lol, people are asking about the phone
Is Scoots reading this now or is it pre-recorded?
Kammerjunk: He's reading it now
Scoots is laughing about being a troll :D
Oh, lol.
that was cheap, dead children and a goddamn screamer. boooo <.<
stop startin Scoots
Oh hi, Scoots.
WHO WAS PHONE
AttackPony: indeed, and I havent seen any LP that finished the game.
Meanwhile: TLDR, Creepypasta of Squidward's suicide
Yep twilight_sprinkle
I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD THE SMARTS TO PAUSE ;D
Lol.
AttackPony: Oh, that all? Meh.
Dat background voice.
Alchemist: I don't think anyone finishes those games...It seems to be never-ending
Who's yelling in the background?
Jim: Squidwar.
dat stor is ridicolous
Squidward*
Who's yelling in the background? :D
*story
whos in the background
ok so
whats happening right now?
AttackPony: the neverending staitway actually have an ending.
ACS13123: Scoots is reading Squidward's Suicide.
Kammerjunk: and there was a screamer?
Alchemist: Really? The let's plays I've seen never got to the end.
ACS13123: yep
AttackPony: at least one version does.
ACS13123: No, that was Scoots.
I hate screamers ;v
ACS13123: well, scoots did a screamer
Alchemist: The only one they have for playing now is 087-B
tut tut
DO IT
No one paused
apart from me
wow
:/
ACS13123: well after the screamer imma pause it now
Wait, a shotgun?
tentacles aren't suited to pull triggers
Where the hell did Squidward get a shotgun?
I've read that creepypasta
i expected creepyness, not cheap screamers
AttackPony: the weird Weeping Angel thing?
Hey everypony!
I dont feel hungry anymore
Kammerjunk: Uhh, internet?
hi Biglaw
MadSurge: SCP
twilight_sprinkle: I paused it as soon as the skull came up after the pokemon thing
hey Biglaw you sleep well
Heya, Biglaw!
Hey Biglaw!
and I don't get lost episode creepypasta
Jim: Sure thing, Timmy.
MadSurge: I've never seen Doctor Who
Im in popout chat right now :/
alexxm yeah
/me wubs pings
wheeee, creepypasta
ACS13123: i actually thought there might be a screamer, but i thought hey, this is bronystate :\
twilight_sprinkle: Consider that this was originally a written story.
AttackPony: I know, the weird thing that attacks those who don't look at it?
Written stories can't have screamers.
twilight_sprinkle, at least we're not playing Luna Game
twilight_sprinkle: dont EVER trust ANYONE, i got pranked at school, lukily it wasnt one of the BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ones, just a soft breeee~
Kammerjunk: Unless the reader screams
luckily*
which Scoot did
Kammerjunk: i know, but the video with squidward can, and so can scoots
CrimsonPhoenix: That game looks so silly.
CrimsonPhoenix: dunno what that is
ACS13123: whats a bree?
Kammerjunk, it's silly but there's shock values
twilight_sprinkle: my representation of the noice the screamers make
twilight_sprinkle: he means a loud scream
is this stalling out for anyone else?
Brée is a commune in the Mayenne department in north-western France
hah!
ah k
first game being a simple creepy picture popup
lolololo
trollol
this can only end well
Kammerjunk: dont be a smartass :/

Kammerjunk: you know a scream... but dont remember where from... wow... uhh k

Oh hey, is Clash playing in the background?

twilight_sprinkle: a guy walking through a door?
ACS13123: I really recognise that scream. It's from a film.
Master-Derpy: no this doesnt have a screamer
And this music ruins the mood.
this reminds me of Dolan
I see you guys are watching an Andy Worhol film.
WOOO TRIPPY SCREEEEEEN
I want a hug to make the fear fo away.
Master-Derpy: Dont listen to anyone, EVER

Did anypony here read the Lavender Town creepypasta?
/me hugs everyone, "hush now quiet now..."
this song supposedly killed kids
what the buck did all the streamers lose thier sanity at the same time?
Hey Very_Silly_Filly! :$
Scoot-Scootaloo: I dont trust you... *sets volume low and moves screen
I liked that one.
Hey Very_Silly_Filly :)
OK ACS13123 IS THIS GOOD:|
Kammerjunk: the thing with garys dead rattata?
twilight_sprinkle: That's the one.
Kammerjunk is it good?
Master-Derpy: YES, KEEP TALKING JUST LIKE THAT!
why are we watching teh Spectrum of the Lavandia song?
the video is louder than you scoot

OKIE DOKI LOKI
Invi: I liked it. Then again, it was one of the first creepypastas I read.
/me Screamer
BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
:p
Lil_B idk. analyse? :D
wait, thats not Lavandia... O forgot the name of the town...
Ok
I come to suddenly find Earthbound music
interesting
XD
I love /nick
do I hear talking?
Very_Silly_Filly, Earthbound??
That's Pokeon
Pokemon**
so much buffering
This place is weird...
Ahh, okay, sounds very earthboundy
Very_Silly_Filly thats the Poketmonsters
Oh god Scoot-Scootaloo ....
mew: Theres always talking, and if theres talking, you run
Sorreh
I showed you this didn't I? :P
ACS13123: Actually, "bree" is also the eyelid and the eyebrow.
Very_Silly_Filly interesting you said that, cause both teams worked on pokemon and earthbound
Man I remember the times when I used to read the SCP stuff right before I went to sleep the nightmare those things induced.
somthing is wrong
Lil_B it is Lavandia => Lavender town in english ^^
Kammerjunk: Stop ruining my fun D;
Quick_Thinker: Oh, you're asking for ponies, are you?
ACS13123: :D
Lil_B or something like that
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldhklbe9FX1qdm4jeo1_500.jpg
Activate the G3!
no im asking for anything happy not just ponies
the ufck
You want ponies? GO READ CUPCAKES THEN!
Oh hi ghost
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQ1Gc6-TTg
:'(
I was seriously scared of the dark because of Marowak's ghost
awesome :D
Guys, you all know this song alone caused so many people to hallucinate?
well i was gonna say does any1 else like the music until that..
And made people sick and puke?
They want Ponies guys
I think Scoots is reading the Creepy Pasta?
What's this? I don't see anything creepy from it.
YOU FOOLS
Quick_Thinker: Oh, but this is Lavender Town!
AttackPony: Use Headphones
can't hear him though
Vordox: i heard it made children suicide
Dken2021 its fuuny, everyone says Giygas from Mother 1 and Newtwo look somuch alike because the same teams made the games, and while the thing weith the teams is true, the lead designers were totally different XD
Vordox: wasnt that the porygon episode
twilight_sprinkle: Several factors, but may be a part of it
Vordox: I am. Still don't see how it's creepy.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: No
Rule of bronystate never ask for ponies, you never get what you want
Ehh doesn't work on me
well apparently im lucky it has no effecct on me
I can hear something underneath the music. Am I the only one?
twilight_sprinkle: A bit retarded, ey?
AttackPony: Listen to the tunes, carefully.
Dken2021: Theres one thing, seeing a Marowak= OMG A POKEMON, seeing a GHOST Marowak is like HOLY CRAP AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Porygon ep only induced seizures.
Kammerjunk: Yeah, just Scoot-Scootaloo talking
Vordox: well then i didnt here about it then i guess\
The other day, someone streamed a nice Metal cover to this song.
Very_Silly_Filly: But it stopped when the video buffered!
The thing is, this is offpanned Tunes
Very_Silly_Filly: i guess, but even many adults are oversensitive, let a alone children
Midnight_Splendor: and because of that Porygon has never been in the anime
Scoot-Scootaloo: can I ever trust you?
WAIT WAHT IF NOW HEAR ME OUT SCOOTALOO IS GONE AND WE JUST THINK WE HEAR HIM THE SIGNS OF MADNESSS
Wtf
Offpanned tunes causes headache, depression and nauseating feelings
Why cook?
Scoot-Scootaloo, the music is way louder than your voice
Quick_Thinker: conspiracykeanu.jpg?
I don't want aids
CrimsonPhoenix: thats a good thing... :p
This was in the original Pokemon release, as an experiment
eh, lavender town music isn't that scary, pokemon tower, true terror
Funny thing is the seizure inducing scene was actually caused by pikachu not porygon.
jk
we should write a creepypasta about Scoot-Scootaloo after this stream
Low frequencies are known to cause uneasiness
But it got changed in the EU release, but not the NTSC release
I always feared Pokemon tower
Vordox: Joke's on them, I already have a headache.
I loved Lavender town music
Dken2021 I remember the first time I encountered the "ghost" there
What is we watching?o.o
Vordox: I hear them but I still don't hear anything wrong. Maybe because I've never played any Pokemon games
Vordox: wat are you conspiracy Lyra
08,01well
Kammerjunk: If you guys REALLY want to feel it, Listen to the tunes, where are they coming from?
WELL
GabeMoist: like that weapon of Einstein
08,01i'm going to die in 2048
08,01when i'm 61
Midnight_Splendor, I know. It's so unfair.
Vordox out of the speakers
AttackPony: The younger you are, the more sensitive you are to it.
how come?
Plan everything
Vordox: My headset?
*ohai
Vordox: Also, I feel pretty happy right now. This song is relaxing
Vordox: I hear something that sounds like some kind of bass....
i have no clue where the tunes ae coming from but im not looking to far into it might drive me mad
That fortunteller crap?
Must..not..slap..flank...
Everyone loves Pikachu, and Porygon is technically artificial.
Vordox: you saying it has to be mono like a gameboy
AttackPony: That's a bass pan, it's...err....How to explain it.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Gameboy never was mono
08,01Dken2021: yes, actually. the numbers 61 and 2048 keep on appearing for me when i talk about death.
According to a fortune teller, I'm going to be shot dead in 2034
Vordox: I'm listening to it right now. Trying to locate where I feel the music. I never played much Pokémon, so if that has anything to do with it, nope.avi
Vordox: It only had 1 speaker
oh thank you buffer
DO NOT WANT
Vordox: oh i thought it was, since ya know one speaker
08,01latest one: there's a weird bug in facebook at the moment that's making @[1987:] turn into @[1987:2048]
Buffer is even worse
I do what I want so i'll die when I feel like it
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: It was stereo. >.>
I think
08,01which is a freaky coincidence
brb
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz the very first gamebody had a little text above the Screen "Det Matrix with Stereo Sound" XD
Vordox: It sounds like a relaxing tune in a way altogether
Quick! What's the name of this video!
08,01this sort of thing has been happening for years
Dot*
Hmm..
08,01maybe it's just because 2048 is a power of 2...
It always advertises itself to have stereo sound. I think the stereo sound can only be heard if you have headphones on.
So I guess in 2034, I'm gonna have to arm myself more than I already am
Stare @_@
08,01i'm not supersticious!
Sound: 2 square wave generators, 1 PCM 4-bit wave sample (64 4-bit samples played in 1x64 bank or 2x32 bank) channel, 1 noise generator, and one audio input from the cartridge.[33] The unit only has one speaker, but headphones provide stereo sound (for further information, see Game Boy music)
Lil_B: Vordox im thinking more along the lines of the gb color
lost the stream....
08,01but seriously, it keeps popping up
Weird, I always used headphone so no wonder I never noticed it
08,01i'm not even looking for it
Is it buffering for anyone?
but you're paying attention to it
It's buffering for me.
Scoot-Scootaloo Probably dced
Scoot-Scootaloo: I now am terrified of you. thanx
08,01Kammerjunk: i know how perception and probability works, and i've tried this
Chickens.
Does somepony know what the name of this video is?
Might play tetris soon
If he remember 17
the ghost took Scoot-Scootaloo!
Scoot-Scootaloo is scary guys.
Wouldn't he die faster?
o.o
i actually remember hearing this song and being terrified for some reason now i know why DAMN YOU NINTENDO]
08,01i've even made a note of the frequency of these numbers compared to others when i'm talking about death
I, for some reason, have 17 stuck on my mind. If someone asks me something and I'm even the slightest bit distracted, I just answer '17'.
09,01NO SCOOTS NOOOOO
so quiet

Don't...mention..Lavender...Town..
08,01ACS13123: when 700 children commit suicide?
Wait we're talking about creepypasta? That shit is never real, that's the point of it.

NewDCD: I'll give you a dollar for that thing and 3 for your noms
Do you think Pi is exactly 3?
ACS13123: well death is somewhat newsworthy
polis bil what are yo doing?
i dont mean to be rude but how ARE WE GONNA PAY YOU IF YOU DONT GIVE US THE PAYPAL TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY XD
08,01Vordox: saying a 3 classifications of sound frequency is proof of nothing
Lavender Town was like..... my creepy place...
WTf is lavender town about?
acs26: google.
Frequency can't damage you
You either hear it, or you don;t
are you high?
Oh. Oooooh. The Lavender Town suicides. I remember now. No that's just bullshit creepypasta. Don't read into it.
FlareChaser, Celestia will banish you to Lavender Town
08,01Vordox: it may be plausible, but there's no evidence towards or against its verisimilitude
D:
acs26 it waas a Town in the first Pokemon game, with creepy music...
Besides, wouldn't they MUTE the game?
Lavender town...my...D: NO!
Very_Silly_Filly: actually different frequences do have psychological influence
where's the doggie?
DCD is high as a kite
Very_Silly_Filly frequency can killy you if it is the right spectrum :D
Wow that Curtain Oo

dudzubehal
Invi: Air is not a gas, it's a mixture of gases,
Vordox: >It was all covered up by the Japanese.
Chicken.
Looks legit.
Very_Silly_Filly: Einstein had a sound weapon that made peopel suicide because of low frequency waves. i forget if thats a myth though ro not, but it definitely influences
Kammerjunk: Of course, what would YOUR corporation do?
The dog is all like,"Bitch make me a sandvich"
08,01Vordox: that's just people on the internet saying things; it's still not proof either way
That dog looks amazing

Dat doggie
Scoot-Scootaloo still better than Dolan.

Doggeh <3

Scoot-Scootaloo: no more screamers or ill find you and eat your entrails
Dken2021: maybe he knows how to put it back together :D

pony_2136: The insanity will come along shortly. Just stay tuned
pfft. The hobby I do it can sometimes cost lots of monies for repairs -_-
haha sure
Zetheross you must speak o.o
It's good foryou <3
I like taking things apart, just a bit hard to put them back together
>rear of the stick
Stop it, DCD!
o crap i played tf2 for 6 hours straght today
pony_2136: We're serious. Movie nights are the best. You see the insanity at it's best
i must.... i must. I MUST
bam wazzam
Yes, I can see the rear.
o.o
Ok yes the hobby I do yes I have to take apart them somtimes to fix things. :S
....OCTAGON
And yes I know what I'm doing :)
looks like my old contra board
He is playing with his joystick on stream. :o
Ponies47: Taking things apart is so much fun.
Apparently people like the beta lavender town music...
Barbetos|Atwork: I c wut u did thar
...
FlareChaser even though it kills people :p
Hard to hear your voice.
Yeah, exactly.
And then it combusts.
HEY LUUK IT IS A BLA LADE IN THERE
lawl
This is givin me a HardwarHardon
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT BETA LAVENDER TOWN MUSIC!?
Ponies47: When I got my third RRoD on my XBox, I took the bucker apart. Then I smashed the boards with a hammer.
FlareChaser: LINK
Meanwhile: Don't jind it.
WindWhistler: people like it... it makes me facepalm.
i fixed my x box
FlareChaser: Lemme listen!
WindWhistler: It's SO relaxing.
I think his mic is broken.
opeened it and re mounted the board
I helped fix a car engine
Must of jostled something
Oh wait, someone's streaming?
DCD
Kammerjunk: Yes it is. But the hobby I do I don't take em apart that much. When my stuff breaks I see I can get it fixed.
ah
sounds like your computer fan is blazing
WindWhistler: yup, dcd
Then I'll look it up myself
and you payed 60 dollars to open it up and show us its guts
WindWhistler: well, okay... may I remind you if you get a headache PLEASE for just a little help click out.
I am disappoint, YOLO is a word in draw something...
Lightning-Quill good guy NewDCD , He did it all for us :)
NewDCD is gonna break it :P
Biglaw how do you draw that/
00,10oh look 75% off all C&C games this week
Biglaw maybe its a Japanese Name :/
Sooo... shiney
And when DCD brakes it
/me drool
WindWhistler: FlareChaser is being a silly filly. It's not like it can drive you to suicide or anything.
epic
Dken2021 shoot someone, and put "YOLO!"
soooooo... im getting a fluttershy tattoo.... and im conflicted between which face to have
WindWhistler: ...I'm being serious, by the way.
Ooh, computer stuff.
Kammerjunk: well no, just it gave me a headache.
you should mod it
Zetheross: Have you thought about the Fluttershy heart?
FlareChaser: But it's SO relaxing!
yea
FlareChaser: What Song?
ACS13123: Lavender Town.
Kammerjunk: how the hell is that relaxing!?
but i just to have her basically standing and having a face she makes
Kammerjunk: Love that song <3
:p
i always wondered what was in this kind of stuf
FlareChaser: I don't know! I really just don't know. It's just calming.
Everyone loves the Lavender Town theme
It's awesome
True facts.
You know what's worth than square gates? Plus-sized gates!
Zetheross: squee face
was thinking the *over shoulder with one eye* look
lies
I'm really thinking about installing tribes Ascent... its a really fun game with retro gameplay
I might buy some games from Desura
Lil_B: Same
Lil_B, it's a good game.
The oldest game I played? Soccer
I've been playing that game lately.
00,03The Lavender Town theme froze all my interwebz :(
FlareChaser: During day = relaing and smoooth During Night = Oh god... whats that.. ahh... AHHHH oh... its just a wild pokemon.... phew... :?
tribes ascend is great
relaxing*
Scoot-Scootaloo oh noes :(
Scoot-Scootaloo: Well, what'd you except.
whats tribes ascend?
11,01The Lavender Town theme made my skin turn purple.
wat
Scoot-Scootaloo: Karma?
I'm sorry to hear that scoot-scootaloo
Nittany_Discord o_o wow
Lavender Town theme sounds pretty good backwards too
im gonna post a pic of the tattoo on bronyland
Nittany_Discord: I see what you did there.
Zetheross: Choose whichever face you want, just make sure it's the one you really want befor4e you get it
Nittany_Discord:Your an alien P:
Nittany_Discord, I think it's more of a lavender color
xD
lavender town is happy and calm compared to pokemon tower
....
Jim: Kandarihu I we could get a Bronystate Server or something I would get it immidietly XD but its a game you have to practice a lot before you get good and at the moment that kind of game is not for me :/
yea i have 4 tattoos already and i know about choosing whats right
hey Nittany_Discord
Hai Nittany_Discord
Lavender Town music gave me a headache.
Actually, Lavender Town at night should just have had the normal theme reversed.
hey Nittany_Discord u free?
hey Nittany_Discord hows your day been
Scoot-Scootaloo: I hope for your sake I dont dream about squidwards suicide tonight. I will most likely kill myself because of it/
FlareChaser, dude that's total bullshi
i always biked through lavender town, but the few times i sat down and listened to it i approved
Where's Nittany_Discord? :3
FlareChaser: Notice that we haven't heard from WindWhistler since.
11,01Hi Everypony.

hey Nittany_Discord u free?
Kammerjunk: You don't think P:
you feeling better Nittany_Discord
Lil_B, I mainly play the CTF mode because I like bases. But the Infiltrator and Technician Armors are pretty much a must on that mode. I'm getting the Steam Starter Pack while it's on discount.
And...I sort of have a stomach ache after watching it too...
Hey Nittany_Discord :)
11,01JRP2234[Web]: No. I cost $56
Kammerjunk: I'm still alive.
FlareChaser: Placebo is one hell of a drug.
09,01http://www.klisk.com/stuff/digi/trixieWIP.jpg
WindWhistler: Aww.
11,01Hey Ponies47
NewDCD: put shoes on ur head again
Its not a bad stomach ache, but its not good either..
oh mai
dat trixie stick
FlareChaser:And Me,still my paranoid self.
But I felt the effects of the first song just a few minutes ago.
11,01It was just an annoying pain.
I kinda got a headache.
NewDCD: I really want that.
stupid flash player
hey thats WhirlyWillow's art of trixie
Ponies :3
I'm going to try out this song it peeks mt interest
Also, this beta song is kinda weird.
Nittany_Discord: I know that feal. Stomach aches aren't fun :(
I hate the beta one..
God, I feel like throwing up.
anyone been keeping up with mane6.com and seen the work to fighting is magic?
Also, the software created images of Unown? That's kinda weird.
Zetheross yup, can't wait to use pinkie
Zetheross
11,01JRP2234[Web]: What do you want?

dari: Watcha talking about?
Invi I'm on with Xchat, pleased? XD
FlareChaser saying that Lavender Town theme gave him a headache and a stomach ache
Bullshit
I call placebo effect bullshit
Lil_B it was just a recommend ^^
Sounds like he needs more fluids.
And a sandwich.
/me doesn't like creepy pasta now ;~;
I swear it did.
I can only read one a day P:
GabeMoist now, that's poor programing
Wikipedia says
Gabemoist:Just more bullshit
"Placebo effect, the tendency of any medication or treatment, even an inert or ineffective one, to exhibit results simply because the recipient believes that it will work"
No*
>Wikipedia says
>lol
...
He thinks it's going to do something because someone made up some facts
>wikipedia in general.
lol
everypony was saying that it gave them a headache and then they come out saying it gave them a headache
Last I heard, there won't be distinct punches and kicks in Fighting is Magic. These are quadrapeds after all.
Invi well XD I just did it because I stopped watching the stream now And I wanted to close the site, watching random Interbewz videos now#
09,01is the stream frozen?

Well I'm gonna go take my dog for a walk. See you guys in a bit :)
My boyfriend just broke up with me.
11,01It's called unemployment and an economic depression.
D:
CryingCanary: Oh no...what happened?

/me hugs everypony
CryingCanary: Don't die, dying is bad.
No. I cant do that.
um what is this mother 3 or somthing?
dem damn exscuses, but it sounds like teenage relationships gone sterotypical
Zetheross: Don't be a ass
i hate em too just keep the head up
I cant explain everything of the situation, but it just hurts so fucking bad.
Oh, this is a long time ago when SuperBrony64 streamed Mother 3.
:'C
CryingCanary you have us, we'll always be here for you
CryingCanary: Afraid that's how it works. You've just got to wait for it to dull.
CryingCanary: I hope the best for you
/me hugs CryingCanary
/me 11,01hugs CryingCanary. The world sucks, but Bronystate will always be here.
Kandarihu: I was told it was SlurryMoon who played it.
Nothing any of us say can help the hurting. It will always hurt to some degree.
/me hugs CryingCanary `
CryingCanary: Forget him, he made a mistake but it's his loss.
I cant AttackPony. I care about him so much.
What is going on
Hover your mouse over the video and look at the top.
11,01Not saying that in vain, either. The world sucks for me as well.
just keep goin on what makes you win is to keep on chuggin along
Nittany_Discord: Amen.
So sorry to hear that CryingCanary :'(
/me hugs CryingCanary.
Wait. I'm seeing the webcam over this now. That's wierd.
CryingCanary: You'll get on top of it eventually. These things take time.
Sorry for making this into #depressedstate
11,01I'm already depressed.
CryingCanary: Take it a day at a time, dear. I know that feeling and it's rough but it gets better.
CryingCanary: can you soldier on?
11,01Don't worry about it.
Its okay. It helps to share I am sure, so yeah.
better that it was mutual than an explosion of doom
....
It wasnt mutual.
bronystateception
CryingCanary maybe listening to the smile song will lighten the mood?
For once...it actually wont.
So... What exactly are we watching?

Im too Pinkamena to listen to happy music.
Mother 3!
CryingCanary maybe watching ponies? Or listening to some cheerful music?
Just don't let the rocks push you around
well when i had to make my ex move out a few months ago giiiirl i could spend days talkin to ya all this stuff
Well, I got to go. Time to put some money into my Steam wallet.

ohhhhhhh shit son i wanna PLAY
IMPOSSIBRU!
Nittany_Discord: theres gonna be sequel?
sweet cammy
Well, we'll see how well a sequel actually does. I just wanna see what the story in Riptide will be about
ass
FIGHT!
11,01[15:06:52]	cow334	deadisland 2 has been anounced
11,01*shrug*
Nittany_Discord EL GASPE!
As long as we're talking about depressing things...I've got one for you guys.
Dead Island 2 is going under the name Riptide, from what I've heard from E3
i look at that main menu and think "NOW KISS"
Y'all remember my dog that has cancer, right?
..
WindWhistler :'(
Eh, Dead Island was apparently pretty meh.
Meanwhile I'm playing it, it's pretty good
11,01The amount of sequels is too damn high.
I forgot how much BS it takes to set up a match
Well, I was complaining about how my dad and my sister keep giving her treats.
See, to me, they're spoiling her. And I don't like that. It's not good for her either.
Dead Island had a great trailer, but a buggy game
lol very random
And my sister said: "She'd dying! Have you no heart?"
does announcer voice do the voice of garen ?
Now here's where I get really upset.
Of course I have a heart. I don't want my dog to be spoiled!
Nittany_Discord I've noticed a fair amount of "2" and"3" games in my gamine library
gaming*
Because eventually my dog is gonna get really weak.
drill her
Deadpool, you call a little girl falling backwards into a window great?
And because she's given treats on a regular basis
Nittany_Discord: Don't say that, they could do it
she'll keep going to my dad whenever he's about to leave the house
/me WindWhistler
hey, Vacation_Wrek. I finally lost my f2p status on tf2 :D
The trailer was supposed to be dark, its Zombies
okay I just had a creepy de ja vu moment
Now if she's really weak...she's gonna struggle to get excited...
I cans trade and get rarer items :3
and therefore she's gonna suffer...
.........and everyone's too busy talking about other things...
ugh great.
11,01The bugs killed it for me.
im listening wind
Well, time to do my usual thing and sulk in the corner.
WindWhistler: Have you tried explaing to your dad and sister that it's not healthy?
WindWhistler we're here for you, and I've lost two pets in the past, so I know how you feel
/me 11,01hugs WindWhistler
do you have the DLC outfits?
AttackPony: They're both incredibly stubborn.
the amount of sad in this chat is to damn high
/me is currently attempting to beat QWOP
My problem is, I don't wanna see my dog suffering in the future just trying to get excited for a treat.
11,01I beat QWOP
RAWRity: One does not simply qwop to victory.
My sister thinks she's not spoiled.
Thanks bronystate. I love you guys. See you later.
She doesn't understand why I'm so upset.
weellllll.... wind do you want to take away one of the things for her to get excited about?
dont be a stranger
11,01WindWhistler: I feel your pain. It hurt me just moving Katrina.
Meanwhile: well, I'm at 61M atm so I'm doing better than I've ever done before.
11,01Putting her in a cage.
11,01In a hot car.
11,01I didn't like it.
See you CryingCanary, hope it gets better
Zetheross: If she's gonna suffer in the future because of it, yes.
WindWhistler: And if your dog dies from all the treats, then what are they gonna say?
WindWhistle take lessons from Iron Will and get your point across.
Heh, seems everyone's got issues brewing these days. >.<
She'll be too weak, but because she would want a treat so badly, she'd be using up what little energy she has left
AttackPony: She has cancer. I'm not saying she's gonna die from treats
:(
I just don't want to see her suffer.
/me offers hugs all around.
take it from perspectives then if you will. id rather have my dog motivated to be excited than mope around waiting to die
CriticKitten: You'd be hard off finding someone without issues.
ping me if you need me.
Zetheross: If she looks like she's in pain just trying to get excited, I'd be pretty upset.
QWOPity have fun doing barrel rolls
I got -5 metres in QWOP.
CryingCanary will be fine
I know it's gonna happen eventually, she'll either get weak from old age, or from the cancer.
or both.
My friend almost did a flip in QWOP
Kammerjunk I got to like, 85 meters, then I fell
WindWhistler: I feel you. I lost my old dog to cancer.
11,01QWOPity: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-qwop.gif
yea theres not much to do in that situation, but if it was me id like my dog to still become excited at least once a day just so that they dont just... lie there
Nittany_Discord: well played
WindWhistler: But still, the fact that she's hurting herself getting excited....
Nittany_Discord: Is that a real game?
Procaster, huh? I should look into that as well.
11,01I beat QWOP, but I dragged my legs the whole way.
She was old. I'm glad she was put down, really. Better than letting her suffer for it.
11,01Jim: Not yet.
11,01I'm sure someone will make that.
11,01It's not hard.
The weird thing is, you wouldn't be able to tell my dog has cancer.
She acts just like she normally does.
But I know that sooner or later, it'll catch up with her.
off topic i would sooooo love it if they streamed fighting is magic on here
WindWhistler: What kind of cancer is it?
when its out
AttackPony: I don't know...but I know it can't be cured.
lollivestream
70M
Meanwhile: 'tis true, but doesn't mean it doesn't suck all the same
also you can get rid of that yellow circle people
WindWhistler: Ohhh *giant hugs*
wat is QWOP?
why does noone check the settings
CriticKitten: Oh I know.
Fortunately, she isn't getting worse...
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: try google
I'd like to see you try that stick out on Touhou Hisou Tensoku, but I gotta go now.
but because she's so old, her body's gonna give out eventually.
FPS is all over the place
:(
User0: but im lazy
You know, it doesn't really help when I'm also fretting over my grandparents' dog.
Now SHE has issues.
WindWhistler: I don't mean to sound horrible, but what would you do if it comes to a decision to put her down or let her keep getting treats if it keeps her happy?
She's the fattest beagle I've ever seen.
And WindWhistler: Our family lost our previous dog the same way. She developed a cancerous growth between her stomach and intestines that was making it harder for her to properly digest food and absorb nutrients. So she just sort of....wasted away in front of us.
It SUCKS.
CriticKitten: That's when you know it's time to put her down. Saves her pain.
So I know that feeling too well.
who is winning
I'm scared for when that moment comes...
80M!
I don't think I'll be able to take it.
I practically grew up with my dog.
i learned early with some family deaths that i dont want to talk about that things... people .. die
Hey there everypony. What we watching?
some streetfighter done right
bad timing
on joystick
WindWhistler: I'm sure that your heart will make the right choice. We had to put our dog down last February.
Kammerjunk: She was still pretty happy and tried to be perky and such. I think she knew and was just trying to put on a bold face for us. We decided she needed to be put down before she got to the point where she couldn't walk, because it wasn't right to let her suffer that way.
All this emotional stuff is too much for me. I'm going to go eat icecream or something.
I've had 25 dogs come and go sorry to say but you kind of build up a tolerance to it.
AttackPony: I hope so...but I just get too attached to my pets...and I'm already a pretty sensitive person as it is.
Well my dog got bitten to death by other dogs and was bleeding out before it died :(
i mean i dont think anyone would care that my pet snake died prematurely of an ailment, but i still cried hard
I've lost so many pets...and a few people too...
Dovah kiin!
WindWhistler: Yeah, my parents knew how much she meant to me, too. They let me keep her ashes.
Maybe ask your parents if they won't do the same for you.
just had dinner i miss much
Biglaw : ???
It helps, it honestly does.
Oh man, I'm getting teary eyed just talking about this...
Death is the finish line to the race of life. Be happy that he achieve his trophy with all the good moment he had to go through troughout the race.
The worst part is when you actually see them die...
WindWhistler: You needs a much bigger hug *gives bigger hug*
WindWhistler I lost a few pets, and a friend tried to take her life, it's hard what you're going through and we're here for you all the way
This conversation makes me glad I have the same emotional resonance as a steel cube.
if my snake i have now died prematurely like that id be crying hard, but because of peoples view towards them no one would care in fact some would cheer
I keep thinking about the moment when I come home, and she's no longer there to greet me...
Dovah I said that, because it would sound like Dovahkiin, Dragonborn!
Clipping through the wing.
Kandarihu you saw that as well
It doesn't help that I also have a gecko who's six years old...he's reaching his time too...
Biglaw: exactly
Funfact: Dhalsin wears those skulls around his neck, because they were the skulls of children who died from illness in his village, and he wears them as a reminder
WindWhistler: Just cry it out, honey. Cry until you can't anymore.
aww i had a leopard gecko
If I lose two pets around the same time, I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle it.
No offence but I think Dogs and Cats for deeper bonds with humans than reptiles...
*form
I think I might crack.
Yup. It would've made for a funny easter egg for Cammy's special to just break the wing off.
see
Not to sound heartless but everything dies it's a fact of life you just have to learn to live with it.
Eagle3302: When you're someone like me, it doesn't matter.
A pet is a pet.
WindWhistler: It's tough. Just know that she got to enjoy a pretty great life with you. Most pets can't ask for a better life than with their family members.
90M!
/me holds WindWhistler close
So much sexism in that series...
QWOPity daaaang
Dats far
so sometimes man it just falls upon yourself to cherish the memories and heal yourself. like i said no one cared that my snake died even some cheered
:(
"Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened." Dr. Seuss
i AM NOT GETTING INTO A RELIGIOUS CONVERSATION, BYE...
now thats not true wind idc what religion you are
Dunno about you, but I've had pets who I think were better people than some people I've known.
Okay im watching Code Geass and can someone help me with something?
NewDCD: not going good for you. :P
i still dont care they have as much significance as we do
Pardon caps...
Ok for the sake of the peace of the chat, don't talk about religion ok?
???
WindWhistler, I know the pain you feel. I had just the SWEETEST kitty around. I still remember when she was diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism and a kidney disorder.
NewDCD: Same thing as before, too high loud game, too low Mic. :P
Yes thank you
Oh hello Sagat
hi sagas :)
Kandarihu: that sounds awful...
hello killerpony7733 :)
Okay, I don't think I can handle much more sadness. Sorry for this. I just had to talk to someone about this...,
She lived for a bit over 4 years. She was not a very good patient.
You need to improve your pokes, NewDCD
Tip: dont have a bunny if you have dogs, a bunny of mine died of pure terror when one of my dogs barked. :|
its ok wind
WindWhistler: No worries. :)
WindWhistler: You can tel us anything. We are here for you
Damnit, why can't I hear NewDCD ><
if you need you can just chat me if it continues
Eagle3302: That is true.
Eagle3302: Possibly
hey killerpony7733 hows your day been
Can any of you else hear NewDCD ?
It may be all the pollution and chemicals we consume and contact...
Can someone answer a question I have regarding Code Geass please?
alexxm you silly filly i have been here for hours :D
Vordox: Not me
I noticed in the Bible, the first humans lived for almost 1000 years, and then slowly they began living less longer..until about 100 years.
Or next stage in evolution...
i derped killerpony7733
Of course you can make of that what you will
-_-
The thing is, a month after she passed away, her daughter was diagnosed with pretty much the same thing. And she lived for only a year afterwards.
Oh got
really? We're talking religion here of all places?
We do not want religious talk!
Hello lard ass
WindWhistler Well, medicine has advanced greatly in the past century
alexxm: Still you haven't asked me at anytime but it's been a good day done this and that
Hey, I'm just saying what I observed. I'm not trying to start a religious talk...
Dat Rufus
Just don't metion religion. At all.
Humans mix up too much we transfer defective genes, in the past the strongest survived. Now the ones with money's get all the benefits...
Geez...
WindWhistler: Yeah it's best not to start one due to the high chance of conflicting views
uuuhg
Guys, if we can all just keep our cool, religious discussions should be fine.
Om you sound like a zombie :D
That's all the proof I need
so what sort of stuff can the fat guy do
alexxm: Alot of stuff...he's one of the fastest
You are either strong or smart, if you are both then you have won natural selection...
killerpony7733: I don't wana get up, e_e but I'm hungry. So yes I am a zombie
/me has QWOPed to victory: http://i.imgur.com/JEG3o.jpg
is this street fighter?
hes good at in-air combos
killerpony7733: Like I said, I wasn't trying to start one. I was just pointing out what I noticed. In case there is any historical accuracy in it.
Vordox i'm not that surpriseed
WindWhistler, in the Bible, the people who lived hundreds of years lived before the Flood, afterwards, the ages rapidly decreased to about 100ish years
COngrats QWOPity
Om Well have fun with that :P
QWOPity: legit or kneesliding?
GabeMoist: Weird, before the flood?
User0: the fuck you think?
/me eats killerpony7733 brain, but is unsatisfied
Om ......what
good job QWOPity!
Dat Rakan's grip is OP :P
why did he just cover himself in oil
I doubt original humans lived over 60years, they would die of hunger, infection or get killed, their lifespan is nearly impossible to estimate.
alexxm: Sliding
qwop sounds like clop
Also everyone discussing avoid the god damn religious talk please
qwop is the best game
qwopqwopqwopqwopqwopqwopqwopqwopqwop
aparently there is a pinkie pie version... is that true?
killerpony7733: All they're mentioning is the lifespans of humans...
killerpony7733: Eyyyup
Vordox ok
killerpony7733, there aren't any arguements happening, we're just talking
Please stop telling other people what to discuss or not to discuss.
How to win at QWOP, QO WP QO WP repeat
People don't live for 1000 years there is absolutly no solid proof.
As said before, we can discuss enything just keep cool.
Any arguement can be made in here, as long as it keeps within the rules, and gives everyone freedom of their speeches.
Dovah cryogenics?
never have lived that long but there is a chance that they will.
To win at QWOP, slide
We can dance if we want to.
her custume and graphics disturb me

To win at QWOP, Mioonwalk

bye Eagle3302
Three Hour Dungeon
Dovah: Cryogenics are kinda....errr....impossible atm.
Biglaw: 1 year dungeon
as for people thinking freezing works, there's huge issues with that, due to the ice crystals tearing up inside people
never mentiond cryogenics.
One MILLION YEAR DUNGEON!
Isn't the life expectancy of humans starting to increase in certain countries?
what am i watching?
Vordox: Yep exactly
Dovah: In response to the person who said it to you
That would be me :p
Derpy kicks ass
Only frogs can live through being frozen.
its gonna be attempted with genetic engineering not cryostasis
im not saying aliens
Lil_B: Did you ever see the Freelance Astronauts winning at QWOP? :D
but aliens
Hey, everypony! :)
Or at least one species of frogs.
herro
how do i make faces?
Ohai RaveBrony!
KO
Life expectancy has been increasing for as long as I've been living.
If we're talking about ages, guys. I'll say Cell splitting
Time to QWOP!
BronyBro: Icon next to the chat bar
Well guys, I'm gonna head too to school. Be back in about 0 minutes
cell splitting?
Nittany_Discord: You lost your colour when you blew up
Tally-Ho!
Biglaw: Lets hope it QWOPerates
QQ since I am newish here: is it really necessary to type someones full name if you want to reply to them?
Bye AttackPony
11,01Got it back.
Zetheross: like frogs and snakes
I thought i was gonna watch my little pony
Dovah: No
Dovah: Type part of it and press tab
Dovah: type the first 2 or 3 letters and then press tab for autocomplete
alons'y
Dovah: You write in 3-4 letters of their name, then press tab
I thought there was only one type of frog that could survive through freezing...
oh ty
dat face
Ah, Cammy's theme music her.
here
What was it called again?
Wood frog?
I dun remember
I think Lungfish can survive being frozen.
not enough guile's theme...
Dat face O__O
I'm a new brony musician, I do I get my music out there?
And so can one species of cricket.
Zetheross: If you're talking about the frogs/Insects, they are kinda a different specie then ours
Cockroaches can survive anything.
so what did juri do?
/me can survive being frozen
WindWhistler: except for a hammer, I tested that the other day... (except not)
WindWhistler: they can't survive boots :D
^
im saying more than just a frog species can
TheSeaponiesofLiverp: You're a musician? Try to get in contact with EQD if it's Brony musics, otherwise, use friends or contacts.
They can survive seven days without their heads.
Fluttershy kicks ultimate ass shes at least 20% cooler than the rest of them!
Ah. Nothing like a nice walk with your dog. I'm back :)
its a seapony version of a couple of beatles songs
A chicken once survived years without a head.
Oh yeah, if you don't cut certain blood vessels, chickens can live without its head
their*
46 meters :p
I just finished "I get by with a little KELP from my friends"
Meanwhile: ninja'd. :(
TheSeaponiesofLiverp: Wellll. You could link it here when no stream is going on
i like trains
im saying that cryostasis wont be the way we live for hundreds of years its being attempted with genetic engineering, but idk about the sounds of that
ok chats getting wierd now
TheSeaponiesofLiverp: Cool :D
TheSeaponiesofLiverp: During stream time we may only link pictures relate dot he stream, otherwise you need to wait for people to stop streaming to send up the youtube/Vimeo here
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Eeyup
WindWhistler: proof that chickens have no need for a brain :D
TheSeaponiesofLiverp: Then you can ask for our critique, if you wish for feedback
I don't know how to get someone else a mp3 so its just on the band tumblr right know
MadSurge: doesn't their brain extend into their upper necks?
*now
MadSurge: Or rather, proof that SCOOTALOO has no need for a brain.
Fun fact, if you hold a chickens head to the floor and draw a line in front of it it will just lie there and stare at it.
/me cracks herself up
and its vocaloid
TheSeaponiesofLiverp: Well you could link anything here, band camp even if you are able to play it online.
a bit
WindWhistler: ;__; NO POOR SCOOTALOO
Meanwhile how did you find that out
The fuck is this thing?
alexxm: probably tried it himself
what is bandcamp?
Oh here comes bullshit boss :D
Dat op Seth
that seth slide
I don't wanna see men fighting, I wanna see GIRLS fighting! Play some Touhou!
alexxm: I read it somewhere then tried it with one of my chickens.
Needs more Wombo Combo...
What the hell is Seth?
that ain't falco
needs more Touhou
Meanwhile i take it that it worked then
I pretty much made the lyrics then used text-to-voice and put it to music
alexxm: Mhmm.
WindWhistler: I dunno who can play Touhou in the mods :D
Spade-Magnes[R]: Expermimental Ying Yang specie
WindWhistler, DCD should play Hisoutensoku
im 20% cooler than ever!!!
Cami should've farted right then
SlurryMoon can play the shooter Touhou games.
DED
WindWhistler, does he?
You sure you can take him, Newdd?
wtf am i watching?
NewDCD: ?
Well, I'm pretty sure he does.
09,01dunno, Seth always gives me trouble
WindWhistler, which has he played?
09,01and now add lag to that
GabeMoist, I was thinking that too.
Hehe
dont die bro!!
use air kick pressure
Seth is a bastard OP char. :P
rso intense!!!
I remember, on the superbrony64 stream on livestream, it always plays this one pre-recorded video...
Dat landing.
rnooooo!
USE DAT AIR KICK PRESSURE
We need the POWER OF THE MOOOOOOOO!
ur fucked
rko
Thats op
And I remember being told that it was SlurryMoon who did that video
awwwww
over over overKILL
Man, that is one tough dude
nice try
If NewDCD does 5 mistakes, it's over.
MegaMoonShine: No, he's cheap
seth is broken
:D
3Which video?
SlurryMoon: The one with Mother 3
I tried playing the Touhou fighting games, not good at them
SlurryMoon: Hai! Heard you played Touhou? =3
3Oh, yeah, that's me
Vordox: not even "mistakes"
:3
08,01wow fans: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0079PC0EI/laughing-squid-20
User0: It is mistakes
how i make fluttershy?
3And yes, Vordox, I've heard of Touhou :P
ko
Yeah, on that same video you tried playing EoSD, and failed superbly
Vordox: there is a tad bit of luck in there too
So is Seth just a combination of several character's moves?
Wow. That's one heck of a finishing move.
SlurryMoon: I expect to see you play Touhou later then :P
nice ass
User0: No, there's no luck
I've made it to Remilia in EoSD
That outfit looks terribly impractical.
be mr t!
There is no luck in the world.
It's all math and logics.
I made it to Yuyuko in PCB, but died in her second phase.
NOIOO!OOO!O!O!O!O
:O
It was hilarious.
:P
Wake up cancels, avoid those if you can, DCD!
I reached 100.7 meters!!!! Bet I didn't get the win screeeeen!!!!! FDFAF
colurful :D
EoSD and MoF, I made it to the last boss (not extra). That's the farthest I've gotten on Touhou games
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2726/ yup
Is there no stream right now?
ur screwed
UFO is my best game.
GabeMoist: On Insanity?
DAT AIR KICK PRESSURE I TELLS YOU
Pinkies4thWall|Sick: There is
wow wtf
Vordox, LOLNO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I beat Extra Mode three times with Sanae B, and once with Marisa A
:D
Pinkies4thWall|Sick: Try refreshing?
Pinkies4thWall|Sick there is a stream and i hope you feel better
Vordox: You mean Lunatic.
fuck that shit
awwww
Awww dude!
you got this
Ah yeah WindWhistler , lunatic, my favourite setting. <3
I was so proud of myself for being able to beat UFO Extra so many times...
And then I got a new computer.
op much
And now for some reason, all the games play much faster than I remember.
Please tell me Seth isnt unlockable
>:D
Vordox, I use lunatic to practice, then play on Normal
Especially SA
omg
This is one of the reason why I dislike SF4, it's too restricted to be enjoyed for me.
WUT
:O
i think you got him
I don't practice consistantly enough to win
not over til its over
NOOOO
seth is broken as all hell
I prefer measures and countermeasures play, that's where the mind games are the most fun. <3 like in Blazblue
Why is this guy so bullshit?
dat azz
Try someonr else?
well I gotta get back to watching Avatar: The Last Airbender.
BronyBro: It's his main
I'm on season 3. Gonna see if I can finish it tonight.
Okay. there. Firefox is being a fucking bitch right now, AND SO IS FUCKING GOOGLE CHROME
He seems to have moves from other characters, kind of like Necrid in Soul Salibur 2
oooh did not know thats how it worked
Soul Calibur 2
08,01alexxm: why?
So what is seth? A fusion of a bunch of characters?
noooo
WindWhistler: A:TLA was epic :p
hes a bitch
Seth is SO op
Spade-Magnes[R]: He's a experimental Yin Yang specie, created to absorb energies
Pinkies4thWall|Sick, maybe the fault lies with something that's running in both programs, like Flash.
Firefox has no picture, and Google only types like this: 012345678901234567890
nice
dead chat?
rawr
no derped
So many meaty attacks. D: never good against a cheap AI
Pinkies4thWall|Sick: Still better than IE.
DON"T START ME on that
i dont think you got this one :(
Nope
dou you guys mind if its vocaloid like singing
Firefox and Chrome are both, with all their flaws, several googolplex times than IE.
So...cheap
IE sucks glue
I have a bad lisp and not comfortable singing
/me jumps on Om.
I'd bring it up to Graham's number, but that's just overkill.
TheSeaponiesofLiverp: You can use any tool for making music, it's how you use the music tool that makes people like or hate it
Graham?
It's like you're fighting against everybody in a single fighter.
Alright, I'm gonna play some Touhou now, which shall I play?
do what i do when im stuck on a level SMASH ALL THE BUTTONS!!!
Oh come on
:(
ahrgg!
Spade-Magnes[R]: Basically, if you fill the entire universe at it's expected size with neutrons all containing 1 digit, Graham's number contains more digits.
GabeMoist: 6 :P
brb
You Got this :)
GabeMoist: Or 1-5
That is one cheap grab
Yup.
1-6, that's really vague
Om Blerg!
that move always sets you back :(
IE. tried it earlier. got like 50 "this program is trying to access your computer" messages in one minute
GabeMoist: Play EOSD
Kammerjunk: ever heard of googol? or googolplex?
ur dead :(
Denied
Dovah: I have. Graham's number dwarfs both.
killerpony7733: I was jumped by a wild GilDash e_e
...
Alright, EoSD it is!
Dovah: biiiiig numbers
GabeMoist: Good luc
Om: Yes you were. ;)
Kammerjunk: but.. but but... thats not POSSIBLE!!
FUS RO DAH!!!!!!
well this guy seems like a cheating AI
Maybe I'll beat Remilia this time
i be back later guys it was a great first time on bronystate :D
seth has mods.
Zetheross: Hope to see you again
Bye Zetheross
oh... i will be back.. haha
alexxm: No he's cheap
bye Zetheross
Dovah: Oh, yes it is. A googolplex is only larger than if you fill the entire KNOWN universe with said digit-containing neutrons.
not this time....
I see alot of mistakes that NewDCD does. :P
That teleporting is cheap
SONIC BOOM SONIC BOOM
Which he can turn
Vordox whats the differance?
Kammerjunk: how bout a googleplexianith??!?!
WTF!!
GilDash: Well, if you are done. I'll go back to the un-tackled Om now.
alexxm: Cheap gives you no chance to counter stuff, cheatin is where it's reading your buttons
Also, A(g64, g64). QED.
SONIC BOOM!!!!
alexxm: And right now, it's both =P
Om Best not to hope :D
thanks Vordox
BACK :p
So cheap cheating AI XD
Om: No tussling?
SONIC BOOM SONIC BOOM
I wonder NewDCD can't counter throws?
I just thought about something
killerpony7733: I can hope darnit!
Dovah: A googolplexianith can still be expressed through conventional notation of powers. Graham's number can not.
09,01still getting used to the execution downgrade of a stick
Oh, it's tha thard to do? bleh
09,01it's my second day with a stick, so yeah
any one wonder what the Brony Musicians used to do before ponies?
Om not when it's GilDash :P
NewDCD: It's going to take a month or so until you get back to good. ><
ACS13123, maybe Touhou remixes.
GilDash: Cant. Against teh rules, and I shouldn't rp in mane chat anyways.
ACS13123: I used to play in a school orchestra, and then I put down my violin for a while... (I only picked it back up to play pony...)
killerpony7733: Yup.

EoSD is breaking on me....
09,01also still trying to choose a comfortable grip
Returning to mission, just having this leotard. XD
NewDCD: How's the wrist handling goinG?
Thing is though, we never even probably HEARD of them before ponies :/
We lost sound.
09,01my hands are rather big so some common grips are uncommon
09,01I mean
09,01unusable by me
NewDCD: try wearing gloves?
You know what they say about guys with big hands?
Meanwhile: Big fate
Hard to buy gloves for.
:O :) :( :D
http://fav.me/d55ytsh :D
If you have too big hands, you need a upwards wrist grip, or if it's too big, even a downward wrist grab.
I think my brain just 'sploded....
I have rather large hands and I found biking gloves that fit very well.
HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA
08,01"i promise your applejack will not go up my butt"
There's many ways you ca handle a stick, you see. :P
08,01i love committee meetings...

And he proceeds to block it all
/me 08,01noms Vordox
Gah he's eating me! D:

08,01what happened was that one of our committee left an applejack blindbag at LAC
then he's going to eat us!
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
08,01i retrieved it
BronyBro: Alot, but don't emote spam :P

Nice rack
lol
09,01still testing different grips
So cute
You use 2, 3 or 5 fingers?
09,01not to mention that the whole execution downgrade obviously hurts my playstyle
The audio seems to be a slight bit ahead of the video.
NewDCD: what breed of dog you got?
09,01still experimenting
what audio? I got none
09,01I think I'm probably going with one for 3
Hehe, alright alright
09,01Samoyed
you beat it?
oh, duh... had it muted lol
There's audio, jus tshame NewDCD can't lower the volume of the game so we can hear what he says during mid game
livestream... no wonder
Samoyeds are cute and fluffy
I hear your syllables now, that's a upgrade NewDCD :D
:O

Hothothothothothothothothot

LONG KICK
/me licks NewDCD
hiya verypony
everypony
Try and undergrip it, having 2 fingers on one side and 2 on the other side, with the thumb on the top/side around it, that's a coommon underhand grip, if you are able to that is.
hai Bronysith

This is like looking at a kid with his new toy and testing out what works and what not. XD
kicks to the shin can knock people out
00,10oh how corect you are Vordox
There's so far....what...12 different grips?
And it's all about personal preferences.
heresy. One of those grips somewhere out there is the One Grip, the Grip to Rule Them All.
Underhand gives more snappy movements, but above grip has a better execution
etc etc.
So it's both playstyle and preferences really. I'll stick with my DPAD. :P

TheSeaponiesofLiverp: is your nick supposed to be "TheSeaponiesofLiverpool"?
Oh

Dovah: And some 3.5 etc

He seems to think that he is trolling by startin all the time.
Sumica: exactly
describing the kelp-culture of the 1960s
ASTRAL FINISH
00,10Google will help you with that Rainfall_Night
Watching Sokka suffer is so much fun.

NewDCD: YOU CAN DO IT
NewDCD: Try and fight Makoto? :P
I support the medical use of kelp...
Friendly Mushroom !
Hey Shizuka!

00,10the turbo and slow mo functions were kinda cool though.
Pinkies4thWall|Sick: DOn't even compare them...NEVER compare crappy SF4 for BB. :P EVER
I also have a version of "Strawberry Seas Forever" a seapony parody of Strawberry Fields
*twitch*
Vordox: SF4?
whats taht
did you know SeaponyMania of the 1960s inspired the genre of Seapony Rock?
Pinkies4thWall|Sick: The thing we're watching =P
I need something else to distract my mind. grr.
NewDCD: have you heard about the new SMP combos for BB? :D
like the Elvis song "Do the Clam"
Still don't know what SF4 stands for
and Sea Sea Rider
I thought Elvis' song was Blue Suede Horseshoes...

that's a good one, I may have to write that

09,01I used to like Nintendo

but Derpy's a mare ...
awesome Dovah
I'm so confused! @_@
i'm good TheGreatAndPowerfulT
13i don't see why steam doesn't allow resales, would just be a matter of moving the license
thanks for stream NewDCD
13course you would want to have something built in to prevent fraud but should be simple ja?
maybe the will at least in the uk
WindWhistler: That's an accurate depiction of how psychopaths work in society.
/me sits on TheGreatAndPowerfulT
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: how are you today?
not so sure in the U.S
Gutted for you.
13they're halfway there with the inventory
13just need to be able to take games you have and put them into inventory
Meanwhile: Oh. I thought she was acting that way on purpose. So she's really just has bad social skills?
they could just add a cut for steam and another one for the developer
what yo playing?
OW FUCK!
I'm REALLY beginning to dislike Bandcamp
Pinkies4thWall|Sick what happened
/me just burned his hand on his computer
lawl
that link killed Shamrocs xD
WindWhistler: She's a psychopath, she doesn't comprehend emotional reaction.
13or maybe like
hai Bronysith i'm good and you ?
name hime DOCTOR
13pay $5 to take the game from your library and put it in inventory
Pinkies4thWall|Sick: I got a 2nd degree burn from my laptop... still have a mark from it...
13then trade/gift from there as usual
Meanwhile: Oh, I thought that term sounded familiar.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: good. just enjoying the bronystate
well then
I now will never use bandcamp, because it doesn't work
User0: How do you burn your hand on a computer? Is it a laptop?
13so steam gets something out of it but doesn't make you buy a full price copy, and the original guy doesn't get to keep playing it
13just like real sales
WindWhistler: laptop.
User0: Ah. That's more understandable.
^this make it happen shizu
Is this topic a big deal in some way?
09,01>Catherine is $20 on PSN
09,01AWW SHEET NEEGA
oh wait Meanwhile is the leader of steam, make it happen Meanwhile
13or they could be all valve-y and say it's 10% what the game costs in the store at that time
WindWhistler: I halfway threw a router because my friend plugged in a very wrong power cable into it and it was REALLY hot.
yay.....
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/13735072988/troll-comics-extending-life
Ah.
13so like it would be $6 to trade away skyrim, but $2 to trade away l4d
nvm I found out what was wrong
User0: you could have been electrocuted there
13that wouldn't work... prices would just go up..
NewDCD: xbox price : ONE MILLION DOLLAS
oh vitural game trades/

fanfic writing is so tedious.. gonna go play skyrim for INSPERATION!
Should be glad people even buy anything anymore when it ends up on Pirate Bay within half an hour of commercial release anyway.
yep
13maybe $10 to trade out any game, which would encourage publishers to price under $10 so people buy a second copy rather than trade
And you better believe if I could download a pizza I would.

People still buy games because at the end of the day, we want the programmers to make -more- games.
They can't make more games if noone ever buys them.

Howdy ekips and MadSurge!

that was not expected
that shuttle seems to be made in china :P
CHUTE
how are they still alive
they'e not
there screens say K.I.A. ->killed in action
so they are dead
they were when i typed that
ekips: USA :D
8,6current zombie game is filled up, but you can still add me and I'll try to get people rotated in for the next one :)
Big day for Murica, spend the day drunk blowing shit up
My plans.
^^^
Barbetos|Atwork: And what's wrong with that?
Nothing
:)
Barbetos|Atwork can you send me the videos
Sure, but it probably won't be sfw
:D
I tend to lose my pants when naked
Barbetos|Atwork: that's how New Year's Eve went for my friends the last two years :D
hey Shizupuddle is anything planed for the 4th of july?
Or drunk even
13go see fireworks maybe
i ment in BS
That is the best typo ever. =P Its also true
its not supposed to shake like that right?
and then SAS craps out
Eh....
I wonder, how do they have a shuttle ramp when there is no city at all on the planet apparently?
huh, I suppose I should break out my flag at some point.
ACK 9 errors became 209 errors!
SPIN
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Hey, we blew shit up when we fought GB, so it only makes sense we'd do it again.
Do a barrel roll
13oh
Murica. Cause blowing up shit is awesum.
and 43 warnings became 269 warnings...
Everlasting_Joy: GB?
exact same houses as Pokemon
User0: quit programming and start debugging
And 269 bacame 599
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Great Britain.
WELP
i plan to sleep!
and so on, and so on, and so on
Everlasting_Joy: oh durr :p
hen3ry: believe me, I am
PULL UP!
Everlasting_Joy: yea, sense make it does
:)
coming in low is part of any landing. It's just something you have to do
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv5qzMtLE60
what is this?
they survived. Boo
oh wait...
darn
what is the game
"they survived" boom!
Hey I know this music :D
13i do not have anything planned no
who gives them permission to survive
garrys mod?
MadSurge wheres it from
isn't this music from Star Wars?
CMC gogogo :D
lander design is optimistic
The kerbals really need to make sea resistant crafts
I hear CMC theme
I find wider landers are easier to land, btw
Vordox: eeyup!
Vordox thats where its from?
alexxm: It's their Crusading Theme.
alexxm: yes it is
hey guys what would you pick out of these choices:minecraft singleplayer only portal 2 team fortress 2 or terraria?
thanks Vordox
gah, mosquito in my room...
awwwwwwwwwwwww yeaaaaaaaaaah
ekips: kill it with bullets
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: :D
this will end badly
ekips try to get it out with bug spray and a zippo lighter
later
moop
actually it's a reasonable design, so far.
I already loaded my laser to kill it
in kerbal Space Program. is there a warp drive option?
I'ma fir'n mah laz0r!
GarrettBrony: you can warp time but not travel faster than light
GarrettBrony i have no idea sorry
nice music :P
ekips: ok then 360 no scope yy ladder stall fakesey hadshot it
in one try
are they going to stream any moar BoB
I ballshot it, does that count Spectrum_Rush|Zzz ? :3
I wonder the budget the Kerbal Space Program gets. I could only imagine the insane amount of money it would take to get some of these ships off the ground.
Well, Looking at Star Fox 64 3D for the first time. Yes the graphics are nice, but for one, the voice acting just doesn't beat the original.
ekips: close enough :D
Oh who cares
This franchise made me listen to a ton of new music genres :D Isn't there reggae pony music yet?
wat r we watching?
fortunately they found most of these parts on the side of a road somewhere
what is this?
Everlasting_Joy: I think they tax the whole planet for it all so thats how they get the money back :D
Hey, how is everpony doing?
killerpony7733: :D
fine you?
BronyBro: Sumica's killing kerbals
and the ones they didn't are cheap. For instance the solid rockets are really just trash cans full of dynamite.
I really want to see this thing take off
BronyBro: we're watching Sumica play Kerbal Space Program
Everlasting_Joy since it seems to be the only thing on the planet it gets everything
mk
00,10wait, did I put an sas?
AKA watch sumica slaughter kerbals
no sas
hry EggWhite i'm good how about you
Sumica: nice one
nope
WELP
BronyBro: I'm good.
alexxm: I'm good.
so wat r ur opinions on derpy
00,10manual flight mode it is then
you mean the Derpy doll?
:D
でrpy位sごおｄ
you know those Kerbals can't fly a paper plane, much less a rocket...
wat could go wrong
i mean how they took her name away and stuff
damn sorry
this i will end in TOTAL FAILURE
:O
I changed the wrong program to Japanese
BronyBro I thought it sucked. But I am ok with changing her original voice though
BOOM
that looks like success to me.
lots of booms anyway
WUT
Awwww they lived
NO
And suddenly, they'll blow up. . . what?
Damn
not nearly enough boom!
it could have been 20%cooler but it wasnt a failure
The combine!
MOAR THRUSTERS
tis a nice design Sumica
no sas on lander?
it ain't landing then :D
how about we go on a rescue luna mission
this game is harder than anything i ever played
not bad...
I just reverted a few days worth of changes with about 8 mouse clicks...
bad idea Sumi.
lets see Lunas been rescued atleast 3 times by Phase4 on stream not sure about Sumica or Nittany_Discord
don't the central and side ones detach at the same time?
thansk GarrettBrony
yay!
Eh who cares
I missed every moon landing
i only ever played the demo though...
GabeMoist I did too
:O
00,10seem to have lost the center line rocket
hai everypony :D
my only experiance with this game is when its streamed here
howdy do?
bye people.
hey Michael hows your day been
/me hugs alexxm
alexxm: good
bye Pinkies4thWall|Sick hope you feel better
from what I see so for this game looks pretty fun to play. is It a AAA game of Indie?
/me hugs Michael back
bye Pinkies4thWall|Sick
00,10whole tanks of fuel I cant use
pony_507866: dubs, not bad
00,10it's indy
Hey guys can anyone tell me what the movie night time is in GMT?? Sorry I'm not sure how to find out :(
i hate it when that happens. my shuttle keeps having the same stupid thing happen to it
Space does not exist
yay. I guess if it was a AAA there would have been a lot moar shooting and day one Add ons and DRM
Baily: It's GMT -4 with DST in effect.
13don't look at the countdown timer above the stream whatever you do
Spade-Magnes[R]: You will never get to space.
Baily they're on at midnight in english time if that helps
What
erm
What
Shizupuddle: ok that one was kinda unneccesary >:3
alexxm: thank you that's perfect :D
TO EARTH
Iron_Edge: It was witty though... give a little credit.
Baily so where in england are you then
No, stop, what are you doing!?
User0: Witty is something we can all laugh at. She just cracked him with the whip of witt.
wat
Also is anypony elses chat white???
00,10any one can do a moon landing
now THAT is optimism.
alexxm: Habrough, near... trying to think of a big city you may recognize D: Grimsby maybe?? :L you??
Iron_Edge: I snickered...
mine isn't Iron_Edge
you're not even close to having enough delta V unless you use the chute, and you can't use the chute without detaching the legs. What now?
Baily i'm in croydon it's just outside of london
11,01I can moon land.
Freeeeeeeeeeeee
Freeeeeeeeee falllllin
Nittany_Discord: Its pretty dusty on the moon
11,01I know.
gravity :D
11,01They need me.
Nittany_Discord: All you have to do is just bend your knees until you hit a hard surface, such as a chair.
/me dusts the moon
alexxm: cool A friend of mine manages a Hotel near there, at least he did last time I spoke to him :P
Iron_Edge: Text is white on a black background for me
Iron_Edge: Also hi :)
at the last second, jump up.
ok Baily
User0: Your a techy with a mad mans desire for knowledge. You would chuckle at someone who broke there leg. >:3
Spinzaku!
killerpony7733: Well mine is revers
killerpony7733: White background with black text 0.0
Iron_Edge: breaking a leg is slightly more significant than breaking code (me accidently having 9 errors become over 200 errors is funny, on the other hand...)
Going way too fast
Iron_Edge: Interesting :D
BRACE FOR IMPACT
00,10had too much rcs fuel
WELP
:(
kapoof
00,10might have had a chance if I used the chute to stablise
chute would make it trivial.
/me plays taps
00,10nah the chutes have a weight limit
User0: See I dont even understand anything you just said about code. Cause Iz a blacksmith :3 but my point being was she could have just said check the clock. Not assault the new guy >:3
it slows you to about 20 m/s, from whence the RCS would have enough delta-V to get you below 10.
00,10unless you can drop speed below 13mps you die
screw the countdown
8,6I have to work :'(
Sumica, what about 13.1 mps?
00,10is that below?
Hi everypony!
User0: Thats like if you decided to do blacksmithing seriously and because what you do is chain mail...(rookie stuff) I tore you down and as you say wittly commented on everything you did.
User0: Just unnecesary. -lol
hai VenHur96
sup
Once you get below 13mps your gonna see some serious shit
^
User0: Or vice versa and I did programming and you attacked me over everthing I didnt know.....Which is everything about programming :D
You should atach MOAR THRUSTERS!!!
so 12.9 mps = safe and 13.1 mps = death?
00,10wait....
er
who stole his engine?
hey guys i just updated my fic of QuickThinker on FIMfic you can read it of you want to
Iron_Edge: simple answer, there was red underlines everywhere... and if I had Sumic a's response was pointed at me, I would laugh at myself.

LoyalDash!!! You have appeared!
bicyclerepairman, I have, and well, I got dared to do something....

Prismatic: nope...at first its auto kicks...then after 2 kicks..its a hr ban i belive?
00,10well if you did't insist on it having toes
08,01Magical_pablez94: depends on if it's a repeat offence
08,01Magical_pablez94: or if they're spamming in PM
08,01Kammerjunk: i might
00,10depends alot on the spam too
Kammerjunk, That's what I aaid
08,01indeed
Sumica, such as if it's Internet spam or literal spam?
00,10suppose i should have full burned
GabeMoist: :D
00,10content of spam
this flight seems to be going well
11,01Can't locate all of the plugs to my computers yet.
its a false sense of security
Sumica, that's the thing about cans of spam, you don't know what the content is
hi everyone
generally cans of spam have spam in them
it's this mysterious type of meat
hai flutter-scruff
they don't have to be identified further than that. "vaguely meat based possibly" is good enough.
http://derpy.me/8-Kly
So posting spam cans is instant ban then?
User0: Thats cause your not the knew guy. Ya' tech wizard violin playin, plasma genius!
lol
I suppose I should avoid that then
/me yells at Rave|FedUp
Hello.

This game is awsome : D
08,01GilDash: about 30 tabs
GilDash: Same that many tabs would kill this laptop
:D
killerpony7733: Sometimes 1 kills it depending on what. :D
User0: I think you would make an excellent smithy ^-^ but in all seriousness you've got some serious skill with your violin too. And you even litteraly made a plasma speaker. I've never even heard of anything like that. So maybe you should try something inbetween music/engineering IDK.
Are we going backwards?
yes
How da fauq does that work?
good morning everypony
you fire a rocket backwards, you slow down
User0: But if all else fails, look me up bro I can always get you a job in the forge with me ^-^
Iron_Edge: Don't worry, I already am - and my friend is letting me borrow his amp (and it works~)
/me sets the bass on fire
Iron_Edge: I'm looking for a distortion pedal possibly tonight

oh, and I shall leave on a terrible pun that I had today - I went to the dentist and gave myself a half hour for transit. I ran into no traffic and almost every light was green. I guess CAR-ma was on my side~
doomtellite, maybe
User0: boooo
now dont that look awesome
User0: Ugh.
User0: Not really a bad pun since it has some relevance
:P
Dem chutes
And no joke, I actually went to the dentist and got there 15 minutes early...
anyway, inspired to try a Kerbal-planet landing myself... time to modify my Munar ship
Fall faster

THE ITALIAN SPACE PROGRAM LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
hey Cypresswolf hows your day been

More like Soviet Russia then Itally...
Who's streaming? I know another Freeware game he'd love
Baked yam for a plot. Disturbing!
In soviet russia, the scooter rides you...
speaking of Italy....man did they lose hard to Spain
Sumica what happens if you add a SAS?
PASTA
^_^ I got out of Jury Duty early - BEST DAY EVER! - Nopony got chosen, all cases settled out - and the only way this would have been better is if I had remembered to take a blind bag pony with me
In Soviet Russia, the scooter rides the Scootaloo.
lol
Yankov Smirnov. He was funny once
I had 2 margaritas as soon as I got near my house - still feeling that tequila ^_^
And only once
Kerbals cannot properly into space it seems
I was going to hit Toys R Us, but seemed too late in the day - never really any ponies on the shelf whenever I go - going to check as soon as they open in the morning, then going back to Galveston

One is very dark and pointy, with heavy anime style and a dark storyline, space adventure, Has violin works that reminds me "I will survive". While the other one is about Agents that are undercover in blue /black suits, with Mechas that can "call in weapon" they use to fight the episode per episode monster.
