Technically, you don't have to actually read any of them. Most of the books are burned, anyway.
Why are they burned?

NOT HIS TURKEY (Hi Saturn!)
Saturn: really? "grabs popcorn" do tell
Dis gon be gud.gif
08,01i'm getting ready for work, and literally the only thing she does for 30 fucking minutes is to follow me around complaining about things i've done 10 years ago and how much of a bad son i was
/me hugs Saturn
With all due respect, of course.
08,01i did!
And she didn't?
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/18053419988/funny-comic
/me nuzzles Saturn again.
08,01she did not!
Saturn: might i suggest a machete?
08,01Bronysith: it's fine, i'll just throw a bunch of rubber snakes at her
08,01she's terrified of them
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzrzp2XGRj1r72kajo1_1280.jpg
Saturn: have her fall in a pit of rubber snakes
Saturn: then throw real snakes ontop of her
08,01Bronysith: my brother once made her pee herself with fear, literally
08,01with rubber snakes
...charming.
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/18052458982/true-love
Saturn: that sounds....lovely.....
Again, reminding someone of a mistake is one thing. Telling them they're a failure as a son is another altogether, and an immense dick-move.
Saturn: oh wow, lemonade mishap
Remember Saturn, this is how you tie shoelaces. Oh and don't eat dirt.
^
08,01MadSurge: in the kitchen as well!
and, Don't die, dying is bad
Saturn: you and me both
Saturn: dont say that,im sure she loves you man :)

Saturn: want me to punch her with snakes?
08,01Bronysith: nah, it's cool; we'll make up when i get home
Saturn: okay
08,01sergio_scriptor: yeah, she does, she just is also forthright and headstrong
08,01and doesn't acknowledge the fact that i am my own autonomous, thinking entity
Saturn: I know the type, moms like that are unapproachable when they're angry
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/18019093517/american-girl-at-heart-i-literally-laughed-out
08,01indeed
Saturn, you should really consider telling her that saying 'you're a failure as a son' is... somewhat immensely horrifyingly nasty, and should probably be reconsidered from ever being said again.
08,01i did the worst thing the other day, though
RAAAH!!
Saturn: well that is just the way some moms are anoying :)
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzplu2JPiw1qlja77o1_1280.jpg

11,01The amount of sequels is too damn high.
I forgot how much BS it takes to set up a match
See, to me, they're spoiling her. And I don't like that. It's not good for her either.
lol very random
And my sister said: "She'd dying! Have you no heart?"

Now here's where I get really upset.

Deadpool, you call a little girl falling backwards into a window great?
And because she's given treats on a regular basis
okay I just had a creepy de ja vu moment
Now if she's really weak...she's gonna struggle to get excited...
I cans trade and get rarer items :3
and therefore she's gonna suffer...
.........and everyone's too busy talking about other things...
ugh great.
11,01The bugs killed it for me.
Well, time to do my usual thing and sulk in the corner.
do you have the DLC outfits?
My sister thinks she's not spoiled.
11,01Putting her in a cage.
11,01I didn't like it.

also you can get rid of that yellow circle people
why does noone check the settings
Fortunately, she isn't getting worse...
I'd like to see you try that stick out on Touhou Hisou Tensoku, but I gotta go now.
FPS is all over the place
:(
Now SHE has issues.
She's the fattest beagle I've ever seen.
It SUCKS.
I'm scared for when that moment comes...
80M!
I don't think I'll be able to take it.
i learned early with some family deaths that i dont want to talk about that things... people .. die
some streetfighter done right
bad timing
on joystick
I've had 25 dogs come and go sorry to say but you kind of build up a tolerance to it.
i mean i dont think anyone would care that my pet snake died prematurely of an ailment, but i still cried hard
It helps, it honestly does.
Oh man, I'm getting teary eyed just talking about this...
The worst part is when you actually see them die...
if my snake i have now died prematurely like that id be crying hard, but because of peoples view towards them no one would care in fact some would cheer
I keep thinking about the moment when I come home, and she's no longer there to greet me...
Clipping through the wing.
It doesn't help that I also have a gecko who's six years old...he's reaching his time too...
aww i had a leopard gecko
If I lose two pets around the same time, I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle it.
No offence but I think Dogs and Cats for deeper bonds with humans than reptiles...
*form
I think I might crack.
see
A pet is a pet.

I am saying on thee animals side, humans get attached to any creature...

Yes thank you
Oh hello Sagat
She lived for a bit over 4 years. She was not a very good patient.
It may be all the pollution and chemicals we consume and contact...
Or next stage in evolution...
-_-
The thing is, a month after she passed away, her daughter was diagnosed with pretty much the same thing. And she lived for only a year afterwards.
Oh got
really? We're talking religion here of all places?
We do not want religious talk!
Just don't metion religion. At all.
Humans mix up too much we transfer defective genes, in the past the strongest survived. Now the ones with money's get all the benefits...
Geez...
uuuhg
Guys, if we can all just keep our cool, religious discussions should be fine.
That's all the proof I need

garrys mod?
isn't this music from Star Wars?
CMC gogogo :D

The kerbals really need to make sea resistant crafts
I hear CMC theme

/me plays taps
00,10nah the chutes have a weight limit
it slows you to about 20 m/s, from whence the RCS would have enough delta-V to get you below 10.
00,10unless you can drop speed below 13mps you die
screw the countdown
