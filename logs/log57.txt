I honestly though applejack's was more interesting
*drink*
i've seen enough hentai to know what's coming
*wing boner*
A unicorn powerful enough to hide the glow around objects she controls
Why does referring to themself in the 3rd person make me like a character so much more?
Great. My cat's making my apartment smell.
only Derpy Hooves can defeat Trixie
The saftey word is 'apple'
Tying up AJ in rope is MY job
*Takes a shot*
10no, it MUST happen

twixshy
AJ is hiding a horn under that hat
Now: how does trixie beat rainbow dash.

Trixie is just a lot meaner.

/me plays tag with Scootagoose

Trixie didn't even come close to that. This is bullshit.
all she did was hurt them

/me waves to the fillies as they walk up the trail. Rainbow Dash, her beautiful hair flowing in the wind, was wearing a beautiful Platinum and Opal necklace. Beside her, Vinyl was wearing her customary glasses, and had put on a warm saddle for the fall chill. It was clearly a Rarity design, as it matched her coat beautifully.
can she break reality?

0There's a unicorn behind her...
8HOLY FUCK
It'S ROMANA!!
I really wanted that fic to end well RainBroDash, but I realized that the ending it was given was far better than the fan service we wanted
she is loved by bronies
Dr.Whoof was in the background...
why is colgate a blank flank?
oh god
LYRA!
bonbon/lyra!
ugh that's... almost as bad as making FLuttershy cry
She kind of deserved that really, that's what you get for heckling somepony who's graciously trying to put on a FREE magic show for you.

0Death to wenches ARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH
10ReticentSmolder I think that's part of the reason why it worked so well. I didn't see it coming, and it gave the fic a lot of personality. It's definitely one I won't forget for a long time.

Trixie = Thomas edison.
And Trixie stole 40 cakes. That is 4 times 10 cakes. That is terrible.

GIVE TRIXIE A MOUSTACHE

Suddenly I feel so... easy to animate!
4Haha, yeah
6Noon.
/me continued: 'So, you girls ready?' Silver says, a grin on his face. 'Let's jam!' Vinyl says, excited. Rainbow Dash looks like she is about to explode from excitement. 'Where we going guys, come on, stop keeping it a secret, tell me tell me tell me!'

Godless pony killing machine.
Trixie: I was busy master....i mean.... WHAT DO YOU WANT?
4That multi cut image of Snips, Snails, and the Ursa Minor? We should take it and put "troll" above Snips and Snails and "mod" over the Ursa Minor
0The G&PT is naked ._.
02Any response manly? .-.
They need to replace Snips and Snails with Harold and Kumar inspired colts.
Trixie sure half-asses it though
Snails has a very deep voice for an elementary school kid

WE HATE HOW YOU SAVED US FROM A GIANT BEAR
Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that stupidly leading a giant rampaging monster to town where it could eat everypony I know and love should be rewarded, while simply trying to do your job and even trying to save everypony even though you know you'll lose should be punished with the destruction of your home and worldly possessions. Wait what?!

Afk a minute. Gotta take a leak.
Black Dynamite is best Dynamite
Hi all.
Warning smarning
bewbs?
Sexual content = "Plot heavy"
...
and so this one time...at band camp...
It's good nudity, not bad nudity like Borat.
Has the movie started? Is that why the stream is black?
Those PLOTS
0RATED-RP FOR MAGICAL PONIES
Isn't this like your favourite movie or something?
Keep watch, that was an exact ban
okay guys
4All Pony eps starting at noon, so...
8and this movie is FUCKING HILARIOUS
Eww... girls
make the announcement
Meh, whatever, I've probably seen worse. I sat through that Last House on the Left shit.
borat was stupid
Borat nudity? *shudder*
Wow, BLACK Dynamite!
0If you wnat RainBroDash I can recommend one of my favourite fanfics too
DSNesmit Ah dont have to leave nohow
MLP also had nudity
Hi, I'm Malk.
holy crap. FOUR chapters of Past Sins appeared on EQD during todays movie night.
lol @Maxaminus
i used to wonder what nudity could be
This movie is extremely black
Borat nudity was alright
are there any ponies in this movie
Loved Last house.
this better not be like deathstalker
8and everything you see thats "bad" is supposed to be that way
6It'll last until about 10:30 PM XD
bruno nudity = D:
nothing but black it seems
mib: HERESY
it's my mate and his twin brother's birthday, I'm getting wasted on monday
Black Dynamite's dick is Twilight Sparkle's horn.
We've had Borat, Combustible?
Warning: This movie has no ponies.... to my knowledge.
its probably just some 12 year old rtard so the exact ban is more then enough
8like boom mics in the top of the shot
tHIS FILM IS REALLY BLACK
02brb
0I didn't know this movie was full of niggers, look at all the black. ;) Nah, just kidding guys...

Hipster_Brony, how exactly will the lotto go tomorrow?
4We're gonna hold LOTR on August 26-28
/me Ghosties was waiting patiently inside the cottage on a futon, eagerly awaiting SilverMane. They had planned a romantic night out and dinner had been wonderful, but SilverMane had mentioned he had left something at home and wanted to grab it before they met at Ghosties' place. With a knock on the door, Ghosties called "its open," and Silvermane trotted in.
badly. in this case Shaico
@chaoming wow rude
6We just need a reason to do this, since we haven't yet and people have been demanding it.

Ghosties <3
Yes we do.
I approve of DJMidli
ChaoMing: i can appreciate racism when there's some humor behind it, but that wasn't funny at all

Actually, they had ALL the old costumes

Rainbow ranger?
SPONSA OCURISHIMASU

So DCD, are we watching a new series or just your favorite one?
What? Chat was dead and then suddenly EVERYONE, I musta been lagging a LOT.
well, they have to find actors that fit into the old costumes...
i vote for epic sax spike
Does OOO take as long to get to the good part (read the part when the rider henshins up and kicks ass) as the other Kamen Rider we've been watching? If so this would be a good time for me to go grab a drink.
LOL the HOBO

dat introsong....
APPARENTLY
does anypony remember that terrible power rangers knockoff from the 90s
the beetle themed one
9...I should probably redraw DCD Sparkle, even if I didn't make it
OOOS! OOOS! OOOS! OOOS! OOOS! COMEON!"
lol
No, DSN, but I imagine there were a lot of them, considering how popular it was
ugh, what was it called
Kamen Rider, saw it before but never heard about it.
9DSNesmith Yeah you mean Masked Rider
9it was SO BAD
I had one of the action figures
mcdonalds?
because I was young and didnt' know the difference
9the creator of BOTH series, Super Sentai and Kamen Rider forbid Saban from EVER touching Kamen Rider again
lol
beetle borgs, that was it
KAUNTO ZA MEDARURZU
DSNesmith: BeetleBorgs...?
damn
$3.5O DAMN!!
Wait, this was Bettle Borgs?! Wow I didn't know that
/me is frustrated
look at that
This is BB?
Also, Ankh likes popsicles
so wait is this the bad guy?
eating three ice creams at all SAME time
/me noms Ray.
He's one of the bad guy race
No no, Beetle Borgs was Metal Hero, not Kamen Rider, similar and same creator but two different franchises.
fabulous
I can tell how cold and refreshing these are
WTF
wait, he's a bad guy?
02Not in the mood, sorry
pfffffffffft
three pops, one mouth
LOL
NewDCD where does This show fit into the 18 power rangers series?
how impolite
This is a different series
oh, I guess I got confused
he's eating WITH HIS FINGERS
/rimshot
LOLWUT
PHALLIC SYMBOLS
unrelated to Power Rangers
9Dman, it's Kamen Rider, its sister series
9they just share the same creator
wait made out of medals
lolwut
Ice cream food is best food
I see
so
these dudes drop loot
when you kill them
it's like a popsicle
right?
Damn, they say medals more often than Battlefield Earth says leverage.
the yummy
the bad guys are called yummies
Cores
that explaaaaaains everything
Oh, Japan
I want an ice cream for some reason
9Yummies and Greeeds
so power rangers and SUPER SERNTAI are two separate shows, just similar?
9because they DEVOUR SHIT
really now?
9no no
or are they interlinked?
similar
9Kamen Rider and Super Sentai: different
hey look it's snips and snails in japanese form
9Super Sentai is Japanese Power Rangers
Armor Car? Do they mean a tank?
9or Rather
Shit
man there r times when i rmember growin up in japan was pretty weird
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
But i don't see seasons thar are the same >_< so
9because SS came first
WTF
it just crawled out of his back
what the fuck
That's a Yummy
>SS
OOZU
Monster of the Week
okay power rangers is silly, this is freaky
9Dman: footage from Super Sentai is adapted to Power Rangers
without the stick, the ice cream won't hold together
kamen rider doesn't have this five man band structure, does it?
;o
does anything that happens in SS happen / do anything in PowerRaingers and vice versa? so are they in the same universe, or they are separate universes but based off each other?
I'm using that line
somehow
9Kamen Rider is MUCH, MUCH MORE SERIOUS
Ever since I learned that I wanted to watch Super Sentai
9spoilers: I'm named after Kamen Rider DCD/Decade
Basic rule of thumb, if the heroes are in spandex it's Super Sentai/Power Rangers, if the hero looks like a bug it's Kamen Rider, and if it looks like a robot it's Metal Hero.
>implying the original wasn't a toy commercial
So is the arm the good guy?
>98 Kamer Rider episodes
WOW
He's...an anti-hero
I have no idea
raep face
kk
oh......shit
what type?
He's one of the Greeed
Oh of course it was/is, DSN
Meaning he's one of the bad guys, but has his own agenda
I meant a *new* toy commercial
What is with these shows and people in awesome coats?
OMG
9That girl's poni version is FREAKING AMAZING
Uh, shit
9DAT MOUSTACHE
So NewDCD, what does Decade do?
There are other tokusatsu as well of course, but Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, and Metal Hero are the three big ones.
She must have Popeye's Genes
What's with this show and awesome brass music?
9http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/300f480ea9391ec3ea0d9ed5127ddc5b/24988%20-%20Kamen_Rider_OOO%20artist%3AEgophiliac%20kamen_rider%20ponified.jpg
9JUST LOOK AT HER PONI FORM
Mmk.
I just did a little.
What's wrong?
9Dman: basically Gokaiger two years before Gokaiger, with cards instead of figurines
is she the one in the fabulous hat?
HER MOOSTASH
12o-o
12o.o
9as in, can turn into past Riders
Yay cosplay cafe
oh nice
12back
oh shit it's this thing again
Decade wasn't as marvelous as Captain Marvelous though. :p
F*** The Police!
Meanwhile
12how many gold things do you have from OoT
so does kamen rider have this color scheme thing?
wtf
these things feed
so strangely
yeah
9Spoilers: The Yummy feed from whatever their "contractor" desires
O.o
Eating money with his chest?
?
Yup
He must be taking a money diet
lol @ scream
9since this guy was made out of a guy who wanted MONEY, he eats money
9and so forth
9if you were used to make a Yummy
Last question before watching some of these: are all the power rangers seasons, like time / wild force ,ninjastorm/samurai etc etc, the same in the japanese versions?
it would eat ponies?
I am here to eat the bank!
D:
9he'd probably feed out of pony merchandise or something
12umm...
Oh I see.
that's horrible
10XD
Best example ever, DCD :D
So if I desire wiminz, what do I eat?
don't worry, guys, you're safe with me
12in my original file on N64 I have 100
12i bet you have all 100
Dman: No, not at all. They use the footage, but write their own stories.
WE MUST STOP IT FROM EATING THE PONIES!
12in 3D
hush, fluttershy, I won't let anyone eat you
9Dman: somewhat. Wild Force = Gaoranger, Ninja Storm= Hurricanger
I will take this Yen AND EAT IT!!!
Once you were healed, you'd get slapped with over 9000 rape convictions, Dari
12I have around 50 and around 30
9Dari: DON'T GO THERE BRO
Dee_Twenty ok i'll just have to watch ALL OF THEM
9JUST DON'T
XD
12oh
12OoT and MQ respectively
CAKE BOSS!
12must catch up D:
9their plots are pretty different most of the time
humans WANTED THEM
YES CAKES
Here's the other badguy
>plots
He is awesome
Cakes > Pie
SPLENDIIIIID
So, this is the main bad guy?
cupcakes>cake
meh, i dun care about catching up
There are many badguys
muffins>cupcakes
12Hey Umbreon :34
that's the general hierarchy
Car Ranger for example was meant to be more of a parody, Turbo however the plot was (intended) to be serious, and because of this it's well known as the season that nearly killed Power Rangers.
9OOOs
lol wtf
12-4
6This guy is a level of crazy that is just awesome.
also, why is he pouring icing
WUT
9BEYOND INFINITY, MOTHERFUCKER
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS
I CAN DO WAT I WANT CUZ I"M RICH
12also i don't care either
O∞
12i just said that for the kick of it
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOs
OOO
he can't be bigger than John Malkovich
or Stallone
9yes
or the bad guy from Judge Dredd
9I know
BIG CAKE IS BIG!
LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
9Cakeboss is AMAZING
Is Cakeboss his actual name?
Kamina is a pretty good ham
big ham
wow, they really want that blond guy to be bishie don't they
yes
9nah, it's his fan nickname
also, disappearing arm is lols
He likes cake, so evil people make's cakes, so from this I have learned that Cakes are made by Evil People and if that's true then Cakes = Evil
definitely
CAKEBAWS
wow this shit's pretty serious for a weird japanese fighting show
Eiji is frikken badass, btw
I was going to say, between that and Yummies it's hard to believe this is supposed to be more serious than Super Sentai. XD
04gold skulltula oh god
THE CAKE IS A LIE!
KEEIKII BOSSU
04those things are hell to find x-x
did they died
where's that weird cake monster coming from though?
KEEKII
12i agreee
scratch the cake, I wanted to write bug
so if you made a yummy out of a pony
SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCEEEEEEEE!!!
what would it be
I loved that expression
It's the yummy that was eating money
0.0
holy shit this is dark
veryserious for what it was
YEah.
EIJI is badass
0.o children getting shot in the face
okaaaay
9Kamen Rider is some SERIOUS SHIT, CAN YA CATS DIG IT
silly feeling's gone
Well if it was made of Rainbow Dash it would probably eat the Wonderbolts.
This is pretty dark, you know for Kids!
Happy hobo is not so happy
More Grimdark than one would think O.o
9Kamen Rider would make a great primetime show
9also
12i'm determined to at least get 30 though
applejack... would eat granny smith's hip
9SPOILERS: this is nowhere near as dark as Kuuga
xD
dear god pinkie
9or Kamen Rider BLACK
what would pinkie eat
pinkie would eat... sweets?
9this is actually pretty light for standard Rider fare
Pinkie would eat Dash of course.
Hmmm... Twilight would eat books and possibly friends, Rarity would obsessively cut up all the clothes in sight, and Pinkie would devour sweets and throw parties. So no change in Pinkie's case then.
Eiji ran up there, un-henshined, and is going to save people
Pinkie will eat anything
pinkie's yummy would feed on fun
pure fun
12I have over 9000 of them
/me runs
im heading out now, take care everypony wish i can stay for the rest of this x.x
12lol
NewDCD what's the difference between black and black rx?
12that was tasty
9Dman: Black RX is the sequel, as in think Black leveled up
12why didn't i put pepper on my mac and cheese before
oh ok. is that also dark?
dat physics
9Black RX is really lighthearted too
oh
12XD
wait so the arm left the other guy to die
9and Black RX was used for Saban's Masked Rider
HENSHIN!
TaToBa
Oh, this bit. They always transform just before they hit the ground.
TATOBATATOBA!
this kid's nose is strange
And now, the awesome sword
it's too low or something on his face
9DAT SWORD
TaToBa=DyNoMite
lol dat hand
SUGOI
do vending machines actually look like this in japan?
Wow, a sword
12Really though, I have around 25 on the 3D one
DCD is the big Kamen Rider fan, he'd probably know which one I'm talking about.
12:<
12i see
well, do coins look like that in Japan?
12i wanna build an unlimited lostgar
Pretty much, DSN, but they usually have panties inside.
NICE TRANSformation wow
Epic
9I mentioned it
0430 gets you waht
04*what
9oh
04the Giant's Wallet?
I want that vending machine
9you mean Kamen Rider Dragon Knight
9it's based in Ryuki
Yeah, that's the one.
AND IT COMES WITH COKE DISPENSARY
And now, more merchendise
12Xd
awesome
He must use a vending machine to get a power, I have to admit that is origional
04or is that 40?
wat. NewDCD have you seen every thing to do with powerrangers?
oh wait they aren't actually drinks
12XD*
FUCK. YES
drat
ROBOCANS
OCTOPUS
oh thats cool
I was hoping for a drink machine
Oh wait...
OCTOPI
9Dman: Power Ranger/Super Sentai ain't my thing
9I'm into Kamen Rider
ROBOCAN ROAD
so the officer is just dying right now?
Fuck I'm thirsty now
Seriously, Darf? That's a pretty inconvieniently specific power source
9Gokaiger is an exception because it's AMAZING
12i wanna get the giant's wallet
physics
ok but we're watching it now. so gokaiger is waaaay better than the other shows?
how do they work
Octopus? Can't be a Japanese show without a Octopus
the other SS shows?
12and yes 30
A giant bug! Its Star Ship Troopers all over again.
9not really, it just isn't my fandom
this thing is like a finger horror
12yay
anyone read Goblins?
I don't think Eiji thought this out
9I like some Super Sentai..the older ones actually
9like Liveman and Jetman
9SUDDENLY SKA
12D:
I'm inclined to agree, DCD. I only watched Power Rangers in passing as a kid, and on top of that I normally need to watch all the episodes so far before getting into a series. Gokaiger grabbed me right away, though.
dat ska
lol pwned
Skaaaaa!
OW
I like how this kamen rider is the only one that gets its own song when transforming
PWN
BUUUUUUUUNGI!
12thx
This show ain't bad either, it at least has some sweet music
tatoba
man, he is a rookie
Which movie is this?
so the plot is... go kill the fuck out of giant spider things and collect the coins
9series, Kamen Rider OOO
and the merchandise is even easier to make

Roara mistyped my name around noon
so what about the dying officer
Was he eating a banana?
9he basically BENDS REALITY with his slash
One hell of a Can Opener
Way to go hero, you just cut a building in half and killing anyone that got in the blades path
those are nice phones though
really purple?
glacy
so. NewDCD. which show/s would you recommend?
huh
/me throws ice
9so then the distortion is concentrated on the enemy
That's what it's called >.>

I'm gonna go naow, see you guys tomorrow

Lol
One of these days you guys need to stream spider's web as soon as the normal show is over and before everyone leaves.
Did anyone go to comic con?
dammit
umad
dashite: already happened last week
you finnally did it
Also thanks
Nope, they don't hold cons anywhere near Bumfuck Nowhere. :(
at least I think so, I wasn't there
6Dashite: No. It already happened and it's against our rules for any movie anyway.
So does it end?
Aw
9Dashite: it's been done
9or so I hear
Who's the one that wanted my Saw autographed stuff?
▼ ▼
▼
I must have missed it.
DAVE
I was there
IS
A
NEWFAG
Its the Anti Triforce!
Sup my bronies
just kidding.
Someone was interested in it last Saturday.
Someone streamed Spiders Web again? wut
Because I'm putting it up for sale.
Saw has fans? o_o
It's all good Korrisel
Yes.
night all
0lol
Friendshiiip
Aww
Yeah, I restreamed Spider's Web Aponymous. :P
so who'll stream tomorrow?
Sprinkles.
Purple`Prose
Of couse Saw has fans, heck I even saw saw
oH, he gone
I've seen them all.
9oh yeah
9Dman
9you still around?
I can't be here tomorrow, I've got a party to go to.
9still want those descriptions?
The series ended poorly.
I agree
I haven't seen any Saw movie
>Implying they won't make a dozen more Saw movies, excluding the inevitable reboot.
I saw saw four for saw five
But John Kramer remains one of the best villains of all time.
only watch the first two
I saw the first Saw movie, found it rather boring. Was shocked to find out that was Cary Elwes though.
they're more body horror, right?
DCD, I'd like those descriptions.
They're gore purely for the sake of gore.
Saw is pretty much just gore.
Any exploited memes from Jaws or Black DynamiteÉ
9okay
9*le cough*
The first ones were more psycological. As they made more movies, they brought it more gore.
Its also about traps
hm, I guess I can ignore them then
you dig?
oh hai
traps?
9http://i.imgur.com/hGW1R.png
9okay
There wasn't much gore in Saw 1.
The second one has traps
And a bit more in 2.
Woudn't mind Johnny English or BTTF
ho tree
johnny english? ugh
oh.....this thread again
Gore overkill didn't happen until about 4 or 5.
9if you like a good atmosphere and immersion on a show, as well as good plot and character development, try Kuuga
Thanks much NewDCD
Mhm.
0ACK yea i' here sorry NewDCD
0Ok reading
Elky: You don't like Johnny English?
not really
Anyway, I need to sell my autographed Saw merchandise so I can make rent for this month.
:o
0Sorry i was doing some work...on Chemistry B)
thou blasphem :p
0I wanna be a medstudent too ya know : D
isn't there a second movie out now?
9the same could be said for Agito, which is a very loose, direct continuation of Kuuga. It can be watched without watching Kuuga first. But if you'd like to see three riders in action in an all-around great piece, give this a try. Currently, my favorite modern Rider series
I have no idea
Second what?
I saw a trailer for a second movie.
So yeah.
Its not out yet
second johnny english movie, at least I saw posters
0ok, I really like epic battles and i do enjooy dark stories. These two sound good, but the others?
0: P
Wait, there's a second Johnny English movie, didn't know that
What about the second Sherlock Holmes movie coming out?
From what we've seen Kuuga streamed here Kuuga has a habit of going most of each episode before getting to the good part, read the part where he henshins up and kicks ass, so keep that in mind.
12out
the sherlock holmes movie was good if you didn't think too hard about it being sherlock holmes...
Man everyone seems so withdrawn now lol
9Faiz if you like GRIMDARK but not excessively, and misunderstandings. Oh, and fancy gear, Faiz could be said to be Kamen Rider James Bond in some ways.
What should I sell my Saw stuff on? Craigslist. I don't trust getting 100%+ for what I paid for it on eBay.
but do we need a sequel?
9Kuuga is basically PLOT, PLOT EVERYWHERE
That Irish jig in the fight was catchy as all hell, though
Rocky Road To Dublin by The Dubliners
The Sherlock Holmes series that was on a while ago was good.
I like story plot.
9kay, Blade is DARKER than Faiz, and uses cards. Watch this if you don't mind a depressing ending to a great story.
Even if I start the bidding at 80%
best 99 cents spent on iTunes in age
ages*
It was only something like 4 episodes though.
Crap I think my heart started beating to this tune
0depressing ending? : / I DO liek cards thou : P
Mine too...
lol Doc Brown
there was a tv series?
9Hibiki, if you like HIT THE BEAT KEEP YOUR BEAT. Or, in other words, musical-based Riders, as Hibiki mentors the young boy Asumu, in a coming-of-age story.
the uk gets all the good stuff
Elky: Yeah, I really liked it.
Was so disappointed at how short it was.
Oh yeah
9Kabuto if you like powered armor and HOLY SHIT THEY'RE MOVING SO FAST IT'S LIKE TIME HAS STOPPED OH GOD CLOCK UP IS THE BEST SHIT EVER
I think it might be coming back some time.
The Sherlock series my parents got me on Blu-Ray
Musical riders...
they're doing the second season in October
yay, the song is over
PEACE
The professor Layton movie is only in the UK
and also doing an interpretation of Hound Of The Baskervilles
whats up with this? are we between movies?
more like lord english
berb
awwww
bye stream
nooooo!!!!
Word to big bird Kaezone
There's a professor Layton film?
yep
Hmm, I didn't know that.
Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva
Professor Layton film?! WANT!
Streams done, Night everypony! See ya next week!
noooooo
night apon
I has on DVD
0NewDCD I wanna see so many of those via your descripsions now >_<
night apon
9Den-O, if....well, you like comedy, I guess...albeit sorta lame one at that. The greatest characters in that series aren't introduced till around the middle of the series. Deneb is fucking BOSS. Oh, it's also the cash cow of the franchise, and kids love it because it's "goofy"
Cya
9Kiva, if you're a tremendous faggot
9in other words
9avoid Kiva
9AVOID KIVA LIKE THE PLAGUE
9it's the black sheep of the franchise, and with good reason
Should stream Mr Bean episodes for the lulz.
You realise of course that means I HAVE to watch Kiva now.
Tell us what's what, DCD
9Kiva is....KAMEN RIDER EDWARD CULLEN
9okay no
9it's basically...Vampires. Or "Fangire"
9but yeah
I din't think they have full episodes on youtube
9it's not something you want to watch.
just clips
0why does it suck?
They have full episodes of everything on the internet. :P
9seriously, don't harm yourself like that
0vampires CAN be cool, even if Twilight is SHIT
Whoa, that's some heavy stuff there.
There's a ponified version of the Fangires you know?
vampires are cool
0I'm a big fan of animes, see, and there's one called 'Vampire Knight'
That scene where he is on top of his car is awesome hough
9yes, but Kiva is kind of....well, it's not the COOL vampires.
0it's good
No, Fez's are cool
0um...ok then : P
I need to choose Bram Stoker's Dracula just to prove it
9when I say Kamen Rider Edward Cullen, I mean it as in "the MC is just as bland"
Should stream some Doctor Who episodes then.
9in other words, it's very unlikeable
0uh ok : P
9the general consensus is that Kiva is boring as all fuck
9so avoid it
Coz Doctor Who is the shit. You dig?
0BTWi got all ur descripions in Notepad : D
I wanted to watch Doctor Who forever, but where do you start with a series like that?
what doctor who episodes?
Agree
9Decade/DCD, is pretty much the Modern Kamen Rider Party Platter
Lawl Dave.
0so the party's over
Well what would you prefer?
9he travels worlds, meeting Alternate versions of teh past Riders I've mentioned
The newer ones or the older ones?
9they are very different from their usual counterparts
9it's kind of like a fanfic...and pretty much survives on fan wanking, I guess
9it's not a good starting point.
O_o
0Lol haha
9save it for when you get to know other Riders.
0What are you guys talking about
Ehh, haven't seen the older ones, only when SPACE in Canada restarted the series from the...ninth Doctor, I think it was?
Pst, do the Doctor Dances.
9think of it as Kamen Rider Smash Bros
9anyways
9then there's Double/W
the reboot?
9think of it as Kamen Rider: Hardboiled Detective Edition
Dee_Twenty: I'll see if I can find it then.
9Good plot, great atmosphere, I AIN'T GONNA LET ANYBODY IN MY CITY CRY.
9and two people combine to form a single Rider
Legendary
combine? I'm sold.
9but yeah, Kamen Rider Detective Story
Eccleston is my One True Doctor. <3
What is the Doctor Dances about Dee?
0sweet
9then there's OOO, which is basically one of the most well-rounded shows I guess
0NewDCD what the hell are you talking about
I need to rewatch it myself, cause I think I missed a couple episodes that were key to the plot, lol
9also the combination is not as in GATTAI DA
David Tennant is my favourite Doctor. :P
9it's kind of....one faints, and the other's body is used
That's cause Tennant is awesome.
9sklar: they asked me for a guide as to what Kamen Rider series to watch
9NOW
9as to where to get these series
David tennant is best doctor
0...and youv'e seen all these! wow!
Eh, kind of hard to really explain without giving away too much, but basically the Doctor, Jack, and Rose versus zombies with gasmasks in World War 2 Britain.
Matt Smith is also good
0What the hell is a karmen rider
Blew my mind when I was watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and his name came up in the credits under Barty Crouch jr., lmao
0oh NewDCD i'm good with google
0i'll be fine
Believe it or not, I actually really don't like Matt Smith, contrary to most other people.
0i found the stuff you aired and downloaded it
9also
0episode 8 we saw then 9 right?
expept they are not gasmasks
9I haven't watched ALL ALL
Dammit Dari, are you me?
sklar: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamenRider
0lol k
9but I know my shit about each
spoilders
0haha sounds it yup yup
9also I haven't even mentioned the CLASSIC series
Dashite: Maybe I am. ;)
Freaked me out so badly, I fear that if I watch the new episodes with Tennant there'll be a plot to raise Voldemort from the dead each time
9from the 70s till the 80s
0yea got all ur descripsions in notepad
:P
0Elky Bug people?
trolols
seems like it
0cuz i'm tired and can't think so will do tomorrow. and i'll read ur fanfic and JUDGE !!!!!!
it's japan, so it's bound to be strange
So you want the Doctor Dances then?
If you are me, then what number am I thinking of right now?
9oh
9however
Sure
9if you want a GOOD introduction to the classic series
9go read Kamen Rider SPIRITS
9just do it
9Manga of the Year all Years
Might want to start with the episode prior to it since it's the second half of a two parter.
Give me a minute to close my 100s of tabs, otherwise I'll probably lag. :P
0Yea saw that in EQUESTRIDADILY
0Dashite fuck you and your numbers
Is it a old episode? Because I haven't heard of it
0probably will : P
9guaranteed to make you break into Manly Tears once every two chapters AT LEAST
0doctor dances is new doctor!
0not old!
THE NUMBERS SKLAR! WHAT DO THEY MEAN?!
what happens in doctor dances?
0Nicde NewDCD, challenge accepted
9so yes
/me presses it?
9if you want my advice
Manga of the Year all Years? I dunno 7 billion Needles was pretty cool.
Dang, I cant remember Doctor Dances
/me poofs into a dolphin x-x
12didn't say to press it
Ohh, damn
Spoiler: He dances.
I thought you meant tomorrow
:P
0I like cards, and I like timespeedthingy so those will probs be the first ones
:P
Niight
NO
9start with either Kuuga, Ryuki, Kabuto, or OOOs + SPIRITS
It might jog back my memory if I see it
Thanks for ruining it for me Dari!
0ok
Is that the manga that Madmax did fanart for with Pinkie Pie as the Rider?
I'm gonna have to crash right now, I'm still feeling sick
12goodnight?
Ok.
9then go around learning your stuff via TV Tropes and Wikipedia till you're a fan

Ziltoid: My internet's being a bit annoying, I'll see if I can.
Alright, DCD, if that's all you got, thanks a ton for all of the info. I always wanted to get into this live action stuff, but never knew where to look. At least now I'll have something to start with. So thanks.
With that said, time for sleep.
One thing I would add, if you like things like Kamen Rider, check out the anime Kikaider, it's incredible.

I always figured I'd like Dr Who but I've never really watched it

its only on bbc uk here and i dun hav that channel on my basic cable

0INTERNETS will provide jpony : D
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvuI88UA3FE
indeed
Computer, why u so slow, internet, why u so derp on me
Doctor Who varies in quality from season to season.
probably true of all long runners
except simpsons, it stays consistently bad
0Where do you reside, prince? UK? Germany?
UK
In this case it's due to the fact they change Doctors and companions every couple of seasons.
hahaha Elky
0I genuinely didn't know this
/me brohoofs Dman
I used to watch the Simpsons until like 10 years ago
Where are you? I'm England, Berkshire.
Out of the current series the season with Martha was my least favourite, admittedly that might be due to me being bitter over Rose...
Doctors come and go, it could take to a minimum as one season or to the maximum as the 4th doctor
Stream might be up, someone check?
it's up

0y
Once he started about 10 hours early.
So yeah.
I guess he'll do about an hour of preshow
0yea i've seen stuff like that weeks ago :P
10 hours whoa
Usually it's about an hour, he doesn't always do one though.
right
0yea twiceit wasn't on D:
10 hours, that could mean a nearly 14 hour stream
Sorry, I know the sound's quiet.
That's as loud as it goes.
0o sheet
um...
0ok just refreshed and turned on
?
tbh, I can't hear anything at all
maybe your speakers are off?
even with max volume
0i think if u move mouse the bars disappear
0should do
no, I hear something like static
all i hear is this high pitched squeaking noise
yup
0fixes it sometimes
0OR fullscreen : P
my headphone cord might be messed up tho
I hear absolutely nothing.
Ah.

...
If I put sound quality up highest the sound gets a little bit louder.
Not sure if my internet can handle it though.
do what you think is best
0:/
The sound would require more bandwidth than the video. XD
0'Do your best sonic'
if someone touches you in a place or in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable
go with it.
um well we could always do something else i guess..
0wat

0the doctor has food tastes, man
You wouldn't happen to have windows set up to make things quieter when it detects communication stuff would you?
0are you my mummy?
MFW 1000s of people ate custard and fish fingers due to Doctor Who for sure
Dashite: I dunno
how does one check something like that
I haven't set that up.
0ofc me included ;D
How would I find out if it is set up like that.
0i really REALLY feel thou that 9th doctor is so dumb and 8th and the rest
0compared to 10th and 11th GODLIKE GENIUSES
What version of windows?
0is what i feel
lol
I know it's "Control Panel -> Sound -> Communications Tab" in 7
03my name has 3 r's in it

It's been a long time since I've used XP.
i gots teh vista
03LOL what @ that comic
Tom Baker is the best old Doctor.
0windows 7 masta race
03and who cares, s is just another letter :|
i might be able to upgrade but im too lazy
also afraid of change
Tennant is best new Doctor and overall Doctor. :P
oh shi-
What is going on in this ep?
...Are you my Mummy?
Tennant? Silly Dari, that's not how you spell Eccleston.
BOOM
pyros errywhere
No. It's not, because Tennant is best Doctor. :P
0hahaha : P
MFW David Tennant hardly had any airtime. T_T
04:>
Haha.
No.
04slitherin
/me hides
0OH OF COURSE BRILLIANT! *goes and blabbers about SPACE and TIME and stuff noone understands really fast while building an atom computer or sometshiz*
04</harrypottergeekjoke>
0i have no fave, but i just wanna say i think 11th doctor is as good as others
0i really like it
Eccelston doesn't seem very...Doctory.
0it's ... like the DERPY of the Doctors
Plus Eccelston did NOT go out like a bitch.
0^ read
He's pretty rude, and doesn't seem very intellegent. :P
Doctor Who?
And he's FUGLY.
Awesome
0at least he went out like a bauws
Eccelston? Fugly? Get your eyes checked.
0'you were brilliant and you know what? so was I'
0YELLOWPARTICLES
You don't think he's fugly?
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
/me is a Doctor Who noob and has no opinions
He is SO fugly.
At least he didn't say 'I DON WANNA GO BOOM REGENERATION'
0he's EH and much older than he is
I saw a parody once
0looks
As opposed to "BAAAAAAW! I DON'T WANNA GO!"
0looks older than is
03you spelled it wrong
"I was brilliant. And you know what? So was I!"
^What CallingCthulhu said above.
although David Tennant seems like a pretty cool guy and also apparently was Barty Crouch Jr
Where was that from?
0David tennant's 'i don't want to go ;( ' was amazing
Chew the Ood?
David Tennant's exit was so awesome.
0nomnom
Are you kidding? He went out like a winp >:(
He survived all the shit that got thrown at him.
Being thousands of years old it's probably more correct to say he looks younger than he is.
Lots of people felt it killed any sort of grown throughout the special
Then right at the end.
Sacrificed himself to save an old man.
0OH MY GOD FUCKING FUCK THAT
04oh well I'm tired
That is some NOBLE SHIT.
04brb
He spent the whole special not wanting to die and then, at the end, he still doesn't want to die
0I LOVE THE MASTER AND THEY FUCKING RUINED HIM
At the end, he shat himself at the prospect of dying.
And then he whines like a little bitch.
I don't agree, though
Tennant was eaily best.
I think he definitely showed he was ready to go when he saved Wilf
'NO NO NO I DON'T WANT TO DIE EVEN THOUGH I CAN REGENERATE SO DEATH ISN'T SUCH A BIG DEAL I STILL DONT WANNA' -Ten
I can't even compare Eccelston or Smith to him.
LOL
He said himself.
so is everyone left on here from the UK
When he regenerates he changes completely.
Nope.
He's not the same person.
HE as a person dies.
hi
And becomes someone else.
With the same memories.
It's not the same.
:P
How are you?
0HURR DURR RUSSEL T DAVIES LAST FINALE IM GONNA GO OUT WID A BVANG MAKE SOMETHING SUPA SPECIAL
Yes, and Nine understood that and accepted it.
as am I
It's as though he dies and someone else walks off with his body and memory.
Ten did NOT.
I dont know
I'm fine I guess
Nine had no choice.
just editing
you?
He was already dying.
0>ends up ruining the whole master drums build up with DURR timelords sent it caross tiem
Yeah, fine too
10 went to his death willingly.
I like Star Trek The Next Generation even though it was before my time
I never got the innuendo the first time I watched this
not editing though
:P
Nine had plenty, just not save Rose.
He didn't have to.
:P
Yeah, and where Eccleston regenerated with grace and dignity, even excitement at the prospect, Tennant goes out crying like a bitch.
Same as Ten did.
I watch it at 4 AM on UPN lol
just sitting around doing nothing
Save Rose, compared to save Wilf?
I need to learn how to sleep normal
Pfffffffffffffff
SHOW ME YA MOVES
Nine didn't HAVE to save Rose.
sounds like me every day
Ten didn't have to save Wilf
He had to take the time essence out of her.
0ALLONS-Y MOLTO BENE
0: D
Exactly my point.
03did your shower spray?
0the heart of dat tardiiiiis
yeah?
What would have happened if she died with it in her? Would the Tardis even work?
I mean that's kind of what showers do
Would she screw up the whole universe?
0Hmm : /
Magic.
0yes
03so then your name was redundant
-S
...
Basically whatever Davies does? Magic!
Roara
one-word answer
oo
any plans for the weekend?
its time travel I ain't gottta explain shit
0^
:D
Dman: Ask the story writers. :P
celebrating the fact I don't have to work
that's about it
:P
you?
...
/me needs more art
It's not the writers fault. Pretty much every episode Davies wrote was shite.
The fact that Tennant CHOSE to face his regeneration just makes his whining about it make even LESS sense. If you didn't want to go then you shouldn't have sacrificed yourself you twit.
I dont know probably the zoo tomorrow and something else on sunday
'kay Pixiv ti- WHOOOOOOOA
._.
Ooh, that sounds fun
Vashta Narada? Angels? That's Moffat.
I miss going to the zoo
LOL
He didn't WANT to die.
yeah.....
But he also couldn't let someone else die when he could do something.
Because that's who he is.
I stress that the "whining" is overthought
lol
heroic sacrafice
^
sacrifice*
And he ended up whining about it.
THIS is whining.
0also 'you will hear 4 knocks and die'
'I DONNNNNT WANNA GOOOOOO.'
He's alone, he's saved the day, he's said goodbye to everyone
0then donnas grandfather DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUR KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK HEY ITS ME LEMME OUT OF THIS PLACE
And he still cries.
but I thought you WANTED whining
And he should have faced that with the same sort of dignity a heroic sacrifice deserves, he should have regenerated proudly knowing that he saved someone's life.
And here he is, at the end of it all, and he thinks
0man i love the show but i HATED 'next doctor'
He is walking to his death.
0WTF master eating humans?
He is entitled to be upster.
upset*
0MAN SO MUCH RAGE
Nine wasn't.
0yea 10th went out excellently at least
He went out with a smile and a witty remark.
Moorning
0even if the build up was awful
Ten had no one to impress though
0exactly
0what TTG says
9 had a witty remark, but he had someone to hear it
He has the FANS to impress.
What was Ten's wit? 'I don't want to go?'?
12rawr
0this bit is pretty grim
0look at his face bros
Who cares about wit when you're dying
Nine did :D
Nine was already dying.
People with dignity.
When he came out with his wit.
0nine was with Rose
0to impress her
Ten's last words were before he even had to die.
Yes, Nine CHOSE to die.
He had someone watching him, someone he had to make sure would not be traumatized by the death
*huggles a scalie dragon*
what's the point of dying if you can't enjoy it? - Rattrap
Nine had less choice than ten did.
0not really die, more like regenerate
Fuck's sake I've got no dignity to speak of and I'd STILL want my ass kicked if I went down crying like a bitch.
Nine had to make the transition for Rose as easy as possible
0yea ten had all the chocie in the world
heh Beast Wars in a doctor who chat
