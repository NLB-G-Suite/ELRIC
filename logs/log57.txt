Saw has fans? o_o
It's all good Korrisel
Yes.
night all
0lol
Friendshiiip
Aww
Of couse Saw has fans, heck I even saw saw
oH, he gone
I've seen them all.
9oh yeah
9Dman
9you still around?
9still want those descriptions?
The series ended poorly.
I agree
I haven't seen any Saw movie
>Implying they won't make a dozen more Saw movies, excluding the inevitable reboot.
I saw saw four for saw five
only watch the first two
I saw the first Saw movie, found it rather boring. Was shocked to find out that was Cary Elwes though.
they're more body horror, right?
They're gore purely for the sake of gore.
Saw is pretty much just gore.
9okay
9*le cough*
The first ones were more psycological. As they made more movies, they brought it more gore.
Its also about traps
hm, I guess I can ignore them then
you dig?
oh hai
traps?
9http://i.imgur.com/hGW1R.png
9okay
There wasn't much gore in Saw 1.
The second one has traps
And a bit more in 2.
oh.....this thread again
Gore overkill didn't happen until about 4 or 5.
9if you like a good atmosphere and immersion on a show, as well as good plot and character development, try Kuuga
Mhm.
0Ok reading
not really
:o
0Sorry i was doing some work...on Chemistry B)
thou blasphem :p
0I wanna be a medstudent too ya know : D
isn't there a second movie out now?
I have no idea
I saw a trailer for a second movie.
Its not out yet
0: P
12out
the sherlock holmes movie was good if you didn't think too hard about it being sherlock holmes...
but do we need a sequel?
9Kuuga is basically PLOT, PLOT EVERYWHERE
The Sherlock Holmes series that was on a while ago was good.
I like story plot.
Even if I start the bidding at 80%
best 99 cents spent on iTunes in age
ages*
It was only something like 4 episodes though.
Mine too...
there was a tv series?
Elky: Yeah, I really liked it.
Oh yeah
I think it might be coming back some time.
The Sherlock series my parents got me on Blu-Ray
they're doing the second season in October
PEACE
and also doing an interpretation of Hound Of The Baskervilles
whats up with this? are we between movies?
more like lord english
berb

9in other words
9avoid Kiva
9AVOID KIVA LIKE THE PLAGUE
You realise of course that means I HAVE to watch Kiva now.
9Kiva is....KAMEN RIDER EDWARD CULLEN
9okay no
9it's basically...Vampires. Or "Fangire"
9but yeah
9it's not something you want to watch.
just clips
0why does it suck?
9seriously, don't harm yourself like that
0vampires CAN be cool, even if Twilight is SHIT
There's a ponified version of the Fangires you know?
vampires are cool
9yes, but Kiva is kind of....well, it's not the COOL vampires.
0it's good
No, Fez's are cool
0um...ok then : P
I need to choose Bram Stoker's Dracula just to prove it
9in other words, it's very unlikeable
0uh ok : P
9so avoid it

http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/198/d/0/commission___my_little_vampony_by_egophiliac-d3xtt99.jpg
0so the party's over
The newer ones or the older ones?
9they are very different from their usual counterparts
9it's not a good starting point.
O_o
0Lol haha
0What are you guys talking about
9anyways
9then there's Double/W
the reboot?
with christoper ecclestion?
9Good plot, great atmosphere, I AIN'T GONNA LET ANYBODY IN MY CITY CRY.
9and two people combine to form a single Rider
Legendary
combine? I'm sold.
0sweet
9then there's OOO, which is basically one of the most well-rounded shows I guess
I need to rewatch it myself, cause I think I missed a couple episodes that were key to the plot, lol
9also the combination is not as in GATTAI DA
9it's kind of....one faints, and the other's body is used
That's cause Tennant is awesome.
9NOW
9as to where to get these series
0...and youv'e seen all these! wow!
0i'll be fine
9also
0episode 8 we saw then 9 right?
expept they are not gasmasks
9I haven't watched ALL ALL
Dammit Dari, are you me?
0lol k
9but I know my shit about each

seems like it
9oh

Ohh, damn
I thought you meant tomorrow
:P
:P
Niight
NO

It might jog back my memory if I see it
Thanks for ruining it for me Dari!

Haha.

/me hides
04</harrypottergeekjoke>
0i really like it
Eccelston doesn't seem very...Doctory.
0it's ... like the DERPY of the Doctors
Plus Eccelston did NOT go out like a bitch.
0^ read
He's pretty rude, and doesn't seem very intellegent. :P
And he's FUGLY.
Awesome
0at least he went out like a bauws
0YELLOWPARTICLES
You don't think he's fugly?
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
At least he didn't say 'I DON WANNA GO BOOM REGENERATION'
0he's EH and much older than he is
I saw a parody once
0looks
As opposed to "BAAAAAAW! I DON'T WANNA GO!"
0looks older than is
03you spelled it wrong
Where was that from?
0David tennant's 'i don't want to go ;( ' was amazing
Chew the Ood?
0nomnom
Are you kidding? He went out like a winp >:(
He survived all the shit that got thrown at him.
Being thousands of years old it's probably more correct to say he looks younger than he is.
Lots of people felt it killed any sort of grown throughout the special
Then right at the end.
04brb
He spent the whole special not wanting to die and then, at the end, he still doesn't want to die
And then he whines like a little bitch.
I don't agree, though
Tennant was eaily best.
I think he definitely showed he was ready to go when he saved Wilf
I can't even compare Eccelston or Smith to him.
LOL
When he regenerates he changes completely.
He's not the same person.
HE as a person dies.
hi
And becomes someone else.
With the same memories.
I'm American
It's not the same.
:P
How are you?
Yes, and Nine understood that and accepted it.
as am I
It's as though he dies and someone else walks off with his body and memory.
Ten did NOT.
I dont know
I'm fine I guess
Nine had no choice.
just editing
you?
He was already dying.
0>ends up ruining the whole master drums build up with DURR timelords sent it caross tiem
Yeah, fine too
I never got the innuendo the first time I watched this
not editing though
:P
He didn't have to.
:P
Yeah, and where Eccleston regenerated with grace and dignity, even excitement at the prospect, Tennant goes out crying like a bitch.
Same as Ten did.
I watch it at 4 AM on UPN lol
just sitting around doing nothing
I need to learn how to sleep normal
Pfffffffffffffff
SHOW ME YA MOVES
He had to take the time essence out of her.
0ALLONS-Y MOLTO BENE
0: D
Exactly my point.
0the heart of dat tardiiiiis
yeah?
Would she screw up the whole universe?
0Hmm : /
Magic.
0yes
-S
...
Basically whatever Davies does? Magic!
one-word answer
oo
any plans for the weekend?
its time travel I ain't gottta explain shit
0^
:D
Dman: Ask the story writers. :P
celebrating the fact I don't have to work
that's about it
:P
you?
...
It's not the writers fault. Pretty much every episode Davies wrote was shite.
The fact that Tennant CHOSE to face his regeneration just makes his whining about it make even LESS sense. If you didn't want to go then you shouldn't have sacrificed yourself you twit.
'kay Pixiv ti- WHOOOOOOOA
._.
Vashta Narada? Angels? That's Moffat.
LOL
He didn't WANT to die.
yeah.....
But he also couldn't let someone else die when he could do something.
been a long time since I've seen animals that aren't pets or deer
I stress that the "whining" is overthought
lol
heroic sacrafice
^
sacrifice*
And he ended up whining about it.
THIS is whining.
'I DONNNNNT WANNA GOOOOOO.'
He's alone, he's saved the day, he's said goodbye to everyone
And he still cries.
but I thought you WANTED whining
And here he is, at the end of it all, and he thinks
0WTF master eating humans?
He is entitled to be upster.
upset*
Nine wasn't.
0yea 10th went out excellently at least
Moorning
0even if the build up was awful
Ten had no one to impress though
0exactly
He has the FANS to impress.
12rawr
0look at his face bros
Nine did :D
Nine was already dying.
People with dignity.
When he came out with his wit.
0nine was with Rose
0to impress her
Ten's last words were before he even had to die.
Yes, Nine CHOSE to die.
*huggles a scalie dragon*
what's the point of dying if you can't enjoy it? - Rattrap
Nine had less choice than ten did.
0not really die, more like regenerate
!lightumbreon
Nine had to make the transition for Rose as easy as possible
0yea ten had all the chocie in the world
