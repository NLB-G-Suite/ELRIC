panda: Don't sleep to well
And now he is happy
:O and it's actually being relatively successful!
Om: ?
Magical_pablez94: Hmm?
a few more fuel tanks and triple liquid thrust should pull it off
lawl
Anyway, we're now in a serious mood, huh?
Om: "don't sleep too well?" ???
dat fuel
I'd say this is the most successful launch yet.
SPAAAAACE
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!
Magical_pablez94: That is correct sir
SPACEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
Om: ????????
Magical_pablez94: Yeeees?
D:
you should create a bomb :$
/me sniff if only Nittany was here Sumica to see this
reach for the stars!
Its been a long since I last visit bronystae
it just keeps going XD
they can see the crash site from there ?
when you entirely run out of fuel, detach /everything/ and just let your cockpit float
No, I came on here just as Nittany completed a successful mission
YamaTHou: Hiiiii! WB!
wb YamaTHou
/me looks ta Om , confused.
Oh god
oh god I would hurl
Wat...:D
SPAAAAACE
left tripping out
this thing is going to achive escape
yay
ARc???
lol
wat is this game?
Magical_pablez94: I don't know what you are so worried about.
and then they went hurtling off into space
are you causing that, Sumica?
Space is 20% Cooler!
lol
suddenly crash into the sun
XD
space needs more ponies
spinning away into space
Wait, what?
100.000.0
I'd say this is the most successful launch yet.
lol dat secibd ba==naught
because you have left orbit and are now doomed to drift away
/me hurls
You have no idea how far the sun is from the Earth
*dat second naught
Not for long... :P
100.000.0 yay
Sumica, at a rather fast rate too
you dont XD
look up?
you don't
XD
Theyre trapped in space for all eternity
It takes about eight freaking minutes for the sun's light to reach Earth. THAT'S how far it is
DETACH!
GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN!
meteorite
time to crash land an beach
orbit was not reached
XD
activate the parachute there
Naaah
11,02i liek chocolate milk :3c
yeah, i think you've escaped gravity
I do too :3
Now land exactly at the launch pad!
lol
SuperBrony64|AFK: I like potatoes
/me gives SuperBrony64|AFK cookies to dip in the chocolate milk
CHUTE
and then they drifted forever, the end
CHUUUUTE
you have to reach 88 mph
oh hsi SuperBrony64|AFK
OH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
meteoriteeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!
SuperBrony64|AFK, you need some oreos
SuperBrony64|AFK: I HATE CHOCOLATE MILK!

/me don't worry ev'rypony nothing caN GO WRONG!
/me hugs SuperBrony64|AFK
I've seen enough Sumica, to know where this is going.
SB64: NEVAH
Sumica: are you trying to build a pyramide and gain some pyramide powers?
Phase4: why are there 2 of you! wait a sec...SPAH!
Doth one require a separation stage, or is it included?
/me hugs Phase4 back :D
Sumica: aim for the moon

BEST PLAN EVER
NO! :[

Un-Nittany: do you need a dusting?
Eating Doritos... With Taco Bell hotsauce packets! :D
I need Fluttershy
DeathStar: ignoring me huh?
Sorry Kevin, fresh outta Fluttershy
Un-Nittany...darn we just ran out

Does second stage have stablizers components?
make sure your top boosters go off after the middle ones
richfiles: That's a odd combo. And this is coming from a pony who had Pancakes and soda for breakfest :P
Give me maid fluttershy

Mica: The PM has some music if you're interested =3
lolol
Discord did it! :D
Spectrum_Rush|Plushy: I am glad he didn't listen!
There are no pings this time
Sumica: That was literally, the greatest fail ever from you.:D
Dear princess celestia, today i learned a valuable lesson about rocket science ...
Meanwhile, my own ship is approaching an alititude of 800k
Bananas http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/321/062/72e.png
My god
GO GO POWER RANGERS!
Lift-off actually happened o_O
middle naut man always smiling
XD
LAUNCH
Polydunami: I'm surprised, probably, as much as you.
Umm
ITS PERFECTLY SAFE
uh oh
..................
DiDN'T DRop the rockets...fuu
Were those supposed to...?
explosion incoming
don't worry.... it'll burn off when it explodes
oh this is bad
That looks safe
Wow sumi
I'm not gonna say it
Best rocket ever!
my god, its going to work
That was cool...
Weeel
oh it actually worked 0.o
Woah, that seperation was aweosme.
you should have looked down to watch them fall
That worked poorly
I just hit 900k
It actually works U__U
so thats 2 successful launches for Sumica ,one for nittany
I have no idea what I'm watching right now
(squee) IT!
And yay for me who can't spell in the morning.:D
Still going ~800 meters/sec
Inquisitor: Science
dat smoke trail looking like a bottle rocket
Suddenly. The spanish Inquisition
It LOOKED AWeSOME so..meh :P
no body expects it...
:O
Om: No one expects the spanish inquisition
Sumica: XD
when fuel runs out, separate EVERYTHING!
moar?
Sumica: you forgot the seperators
Rain: SEPERATE ALL THE ROCKETS! :D
Guess not.
Phase4: but everybrony expects the spanish equisition
it was about 55k?
I can see Luna and Lyra
Sumica add more liquid fuel and you can go farther
ya
Barely
then booooom
the right one is stoned
Why use these kind of rockets? There's actually a better way to lift things into the space
105
Use the god damn non gravity force way, cheaper, easier, safer. BAH
speed up time! :D
you loose momentum...
some poor rube's gonna have his house flattened by the falling space debris... nice going @Sumica...
100.000.0 !!!!!
You should call the space sea ponies.
AAAAND
he's in space now
wow
150000 i think
Not enouh for 150k XD
and now it goes down
Sumica: nope
detach that explosive crap!
Uh-oh...:S
they are just 3 to 1 adaptors
That crash landing, prepare for impact!
I'd be worried if I could spin in reentry like that
i think he's got enough
HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT
*snap*
stupid 'chute why wont you open?!?!
erm...
ANYTIME SOON
YAY
Awwwww
that was fairly close
BOOM :P
And that was a success!
/me claps "WOO! He brought them home savely!
Success.
150k and noone dies? double WINRAR!
Impressive
Dawwwwwwww :(
I claim this land for spain!!!
Great run there Sumi
congrats Sumica. a winrar is you
add more fuel tanks at the top! :D
I CLAIM THIS LAND IN THE NAME OF ED! BRINGER OF BACON! :P
Poll: Would you trust your life to Sumica on a rocket into orbit?
I could go for some bacon...
maybe I might abduct my friends for breakfast in a couple hours
parachute?
you gona fire
....
nope
oh there we go
Eynope
Dumps a (squee) load of bacon on Inquisitor
Shoot the parachute for extra points
ONE MORE STAGE! :D
dont forget the strusts!
lool
lol
hole in the ground
can see the water underneath
om nom nom
also, remember the timing on the detachments
Phase4`, you seem to be behind a fair bit
Sumica: ^
Polydunami: probably am
on the plus side i can click refresh and skip most of the building
If you want, I guess
And I just finshed a 4th can of soda! :P I STAY UP ALL NIGHT! :D
Egad, going for broke, Ponies47? xD

Burn the atmosphere!!!
It's 2:20 AM and I'm getting sleepy
Pinkies4thWall: hahaha parafail

need to be as big as possibrule
http://www.pbfcomics.com/94/ What the hell just happened?
Shouldn't fins jut out between the frame near the bottom?
are you sure?
more aero dinamic
I was just about to say the same
Whoa
wtf
it's working
:o
why do you need to worry about aerodynamics in space?
Luna will be sohappy
the one on the right is not liking this at all XD
Inquisitor: Looks good? :P
NICE timing
Hi RaveBrony
Good morning everypony! :)
O.O

very very nice timing Sumica
CupcakeWarrior: Rocketman ...duh!
oh wow, this one will go far
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior, HiImSpike, Ninjazz, Ponies47, Polydunami, and OneTrickPony :$
try and not crash this time
because they're all dead from g-force
with the correct timing like that, I think you could add another fuel tank to the mix :D
thanks RaveBrony
Hugs RaveBrony back :)
He might make it to Luna
Sumica: if you start aiming now, i think you could make it to the moon
What is on stream? :o
This is Kebler Space Program
By Sumica

RaveBrony: yeaaaah maybe I shouldn't of drank 5 cans of soda so late :$
That's no moon
SPAAAAAACe
YOU DIDN'T KNOW!!! :D Bwahahahahaha!
To the mooooooona?

RaveBrony: I meant 4 cans
Lol!! :D
Oh nuts
oh no wibbly wobbly
tooo tha moon
Sumica, why are you ruining your best launch yet? D:
timey wimey
The one on the left
wibbly wobbly timey wimey
success
stuff
Best launch... Just no sense of direction at the destination! :$
He doesn't seem to be enjoying the ride
detach before you are dragged down
lol
doctor whooves
Even though he almost beat it anyway
5th stage
MOAR!
Shooting the moon again, are we?
can the shuttle go bigger
Wait
Yay! :(
yuss
yay
oh god XD
What?
great idea
Yes.
can you go 10?
lol
yay
make is massive
forego any safety apparatus... make the thing nothing but fuel and fire
:(
yeah
XD
"Go..go for the moon..hey now you're a rockstar, put a show on , get laid, and all that glitters is gold , only shootin stars break the moooold!"
inb4 you totally need more gimble
i cant purchace a copy of this game because the store bugs out
Is the ship larger than the launch pad yet?
put more thingies and the doohickies
Suspend 3 more in the middle with struts
one of these days Alice. To the moon!
lawl
I like the sound of that
risk equals fun:$
Make middle rockets
lawl
Say what?
its the sports car of rockets
very efficent
;o hi
whats this?
Cap'n must be tiiiiiiiny! :D
lets watch as it goes boom
Sumica: with an additional layer of them power thruster things you can might change your highest power thrusters to liquid fuel thrusters which help you one you left atmo
needs nos
Hello there Onyxia, this is Kebler Space Program by Sumica :3
holli jamoli
Pyramid of death... oh, it's the apallo 7
TOTALLY NEEDED THE GIMBLE!
You might get at least one more meter out of this
Sumica: the important thing is that it works
Friendship!
:O
I think the wieght of the rocket may tip it alittle
this one is going to get soo much height
:O
true test of this game would be to bring a precice low orbit tactical strike somewhere on the other side of the planet
did he reach first cosmicvelocityyet ?
not if it goes upsidedowny
turn it upwards so we can watch
Agreed
O.o
i see wobbly
as the stuff falls
uh oh
You need maor long ones!
Sumica, try to get orbit as well
Sumica: thats not a bad idea actualy
speed up time! :D
I see little moon
lets do the time warp again?
ooh my muffins 6_9
or maybe it's just a star
1 liquid fuel tank empty 2 to go ;)
WOO
Gogogo :D
To the moon!
To the far reaches of starvation because we wont be able to get back!
GO APPLEJACK GO
Shoot the moon! Get all the hearts!
funny if you see the friendship cannon

Whoa
now you might never return sumi D:
Sumica, look at the earth
That is nuts
To equestira
now deploysolar sails and get crew into cryo , on to Alpha centauri
I have to play cards again.. its been awhile
Sumica: i recon you could add another fule tank and start the liquid stage with the last solid stage
YAY Sumica
SUCCESS
100 k !
AUGH!
Absolute success.:)
owwwwww crap

Right, I think I will call it a night after the next successful flight.
Replace gimbal with fuel tank at top

Polydunami, and the enxt few flights are failures.
night Polydunami
you are placing singles
fins not needed at top
imb4 8-staged rocket
Not quite good night, yet
needs another stage
Fins look cool
Sumica is best rocket scientist
is sorry Polydunami :$
No worries
copy and paste stage
It's not something to worry about
can motors be suspended between first stage?
LETS DO DIS!
/me waits for failure
KIM JUN IL still me likie
I'm looking for a success, myself
time to go cave johnson on this rocket
Trial and error, lets go! :D

hiya Lil_B
Hey valoreins, this is Kebler Space Program :3
Hey everypony
you understand it Polydunami you have won the interwebs
Hey Very_Silly_Filly!
with fuel tanks on top, this would collapse under its own weight
I'm here with my new wrist!
hey Lil_B
IT'S AMAZING
hey Very_Silly_Filly what have you been up to
hiya Very_Silly_Filly
Right, then
i wanna try that game too sometime... looks strangely fun
Ooh, kerbal space programme
I'm not entirely sure. I'm gaining altitude now for some reason, after falling many, many kilometers.
wibbly wobbly timey wimey
strange but fun
hey Very_Silly_Filly
hai Ninjazz
I think this game is free?
Sumica, can you stream Avatar after this? :D
Arciuses?
Hello OneTrickPony. :)
/me foams at the mouth waiting
hello Ninjazz

Ohai HiImSpike, Lil_B. :)

The cartoon Avatar of course :D
Ninjazz: None fo y
Sumica: How many fuel cells do you have?
hiya Lil_B
:$
hello world and all of its brony inhabitants
Because for that, you're gonna want loasd

O_O
What just happened?
Absolute success indeed.
so what game is this
Looks like I'm in an extremely screwed up orbit o.O
Sumica: You connected stuff to thursters
oh...missed the best part
too heavy? XD
what happened?
try it again
"No brainwaves or activity , while the craft is in the air , its getting dark its getting light , we are sitting in a chair...." ok i cant think of any more
explosions
Legend of Korra rocks
You put things on the bottom of thrusters
Hay no
Le GASP! :O

<---- What the hay is that?
Weighs a lot

I'm calling out from scatman
I'm calling out rom scatman's world
:(
too heavy
What?!? I couldn't hear you @Sumica, over the exhaust!!!1
I keep telling you Sumica, it needs more rockets.
sorry i was trying to do a fluttershy yay and I got in the fluttershy zone
ClutterShy badabbadabbdabba dee ba da badda bo
that can't be good
it will leave a nice crater
:D
You're running on crappy liquid, and you're going fastest than you did with fuel
I lol'd
stream craps out right when "that cant be good"
it's ok, he can die 3 times and still have a heart attack
look at this worls... no signs of Civilisation whatsoever...
world*
Who's streaming anyway?
the first stage destroyed the start ramp and killed 82 rocket scientists
derpy_pony: Wat.:D
Sumica is i think Malavolent
I think Simica os having a little bit to much fun :$
dat laugh
Psh... Lil_B you don't need civilization to have a space program....
of course not, they are all dying because they are testing out their rockets
mine had a mechenical failure as I was about to land on the moon
*is
My parachute wouldn't come out
it fell off in less than 2000 km height....right over the start ramp
So I landed a bit rough and BOOM
little dude on the left
He already is in space
Sumica just will never know what goes wrong :/
This is way too much
:D
skadoosh
he forgot to use the toilet before start
Bronystate the website I go on everyday and spend any spare time here :P
Woooooow
Sumica, I think you can rest now
he looks so terrifed
spaaaace
Herbert's always terrified
it this thing supposed to bring them back to the surface alive?
So much space.
hahahha
Ponies47 somebody said something aout sleep? oô Hush now quiet now
whats the one on the far left scared of
carkeya
It takes bloody sex on the ship to make hhim happy
he broke atmo... everythings shiney cap'n none to dret
What's the point of this game?
fret even
Vinyl Scratch Tapes master recordings teaser has been released
still going XD
It is awesome
Malavolent bring Weathley back for Portal 3
man your ears would on fire going this high
alexxm: Seems legit.
And the guy in the middle, I forget his name, it takes a disaster of doom to make him even start to go dafuq?
damn you gimbles!!!
oh dis is bad
toooooooooooooooo tha moon
Let's find Luna.
what's the arc?
You need moar rockets :[
Lets do the time warp agaaaaaiiiin!
Sumica: theres a button to show your orbital path
wooow
Lil_B: *Feals sleepy* MUST STAY AWAKE FOR AWESOMNESS!
Sumica: It says K
these 3 pilots look like... their Jimmies are getting rustled
dat rollover
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuZPkKpQJ0c&feature=player_embedded

You went so much, it's gone into Km rather than m
G'day, everypony.
buck rogers
Hey GlutenFreeJenkins :)
Aaaaand we're going down.
Hello GlutenFreeJenkins!
his orbit's not decayed yet
pause and find the orbit trajectory
2.783 MILLION METERS
owww... Gravity is an asshole...
WOO! Go Sumica!
Land in England
dat lul
now they fall back
:P
there it is
Ooo, a map.
lol
/me hugs Ponies47 and TheRainbowDash
Never seen this before.:)
cool if equestria was a alien world
they will die horribly
2783 Kilometers :O
Hugs GlutenFreeJenkins :)
Parachuuuute
fucking stream, I missed most of the flight because it lagged
Jammy bastard
no death? boooooo!
:o
do you have the option to use the parachute
derpy_pony: Boo- RD:D
Rain: You missed the best one yet.
I wanna see the G
it doesnt open! yay!
crap
i think.... that there is an mlp:fim movie in the works right now
Is that 34 g?
movie?
Phase4: Please no.
absolute conjecture, dont quote me. but i think there is
Is that all?
suddenly, sharks
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was foing about 350 at one point
it would be a good way to make money, imo
Phase4: WAIT WHAT!?! :O
Malavolent: why not?
you can watch your grabbels crash and burn if you want HiImSpike, @Sumica's done it a couple times
XD
Apply for Nasa
Die?
If it's going to be in cinemas, I'm going
Phase4: Who is making it?
oh lawd yes!
Become a space engineur
MOAH G's
Phase4: you serious
Oh My! Luna shitting moonrocks, that's hardcore!
about the movie
You sound like Littlepip
ded
At Richfiles
ok, about the movie i mentioned before. I HAVE NO INFO, its a guess based of what i've seen coming out of hasbro
it's like I'm a real rocket scientists
this can only go wrong XD
I got the feeling that wont even lift off groung :|
add more wings!
My god.
can never have enough wings
MORE THRUSTERS!
uh.....
Where is GilDash when you need that pony?
Seperators?
I doubt that will lift...
Seperators?
Phase4: *Squees*
I bet luna is laughing at us saying you will never reach me
this will end well
TheRainbowDash: On vacation.
how is it going to drop off? XD
Please MTV, pimp my space shuttle!
Om: I know, but it's been way too long now.
and connectors Sumica
Fund it!
TheRainbowDash: It comes back monday or tuseday
liquid is too slow burning to get off the ground like that XD
soo many stages
is there a moon in the game?
He always need that friendly reminder... We are happy to oblige! :)
Yes
Phase4 I think a good Idea for MLP right know would be like a second show, but with more adult oriented writing and animation, while still keeping the original show around, so you can make even more money, without making X number of seasons for only one show
my life is like a fart....
Lil_B: hmmmm
Okie doki loki. Now I'm gonna go to bed. I hope. *Curls up into a ball* *Yawns* NIGHT NIGHT YA'LL
Hope next season has more luna
Sumica, clean the rocket and make it a tall pillar. Put a few thrusters on the side, about 6 on about 2-4 levels, then put some fuel cells around the top
:)
Lil_B: There are fanmade adult pony shows... if you know what I mean.
I did that and it worked well for me
Phase and with adult oriented writing i don't mean Midlife crisis or other stupid RL TV-Show crap :/
Lil_B: i'm not sure there would be enough of a market for that just yet
but it is an interesting iead
:'(
idea'
ponies having a mid life crisis would be worth watching
Good point
WHAT THE JESUS IS THAT
Phase4: tell us
would LOVE to see it though
this can only end badly
HiImSpike: tell you what?
idea
???
liquid doesnt have enough thrust for this XD
HiImSpike: i was correcting a typo
Can you suspend a triplet of motors from the center, rigged to the 1st stage by scaffolds?
Phase4 I know, I mean just as an Idea, with more "advanced" animation
VERY WELL THEN BE THAT WAY! No pony can't even say goodnight *Curls up into a ball and starts crying* :'(
@Sumica's only missing his Illudium Pew-36 Explosive Space Modulator
Lil_B: Have you seen the recent EqD discussion about animation?
ooooow sorry :'( Phase4
What about nyan cat?
Needs more stage in the center
/me is calling it, this isnt getting off the ground without a fight
its going to blow up
Adding weight, but no additional rocket power
I'm gonna say this one more time.... GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY!
going with Rain on this one
Malavolent only a little bit, because the first few posts made me think that the discussion is going in the wrong direction
Lil_B: considering we had 10K viewers for the season finally on just this site, and the number of views the youtube copies have. plus the pagehits on eqd
nuclear fire is worth the work
HiImSpike: It's going up anyway, isn't it?
not enough glitter :L
THEN MAKE IT BLOW UP NOW
Lil_B: its not imposible
That works too
YOU'RE A MADMAN SHIZUKA :D
night Ponies47
maybe
night Ponies47
oh god this wont end well XD
YAY!
Lil_B: The discussion itself is not as important as that short clip of ponies animated in different style.
night Ponies47
Phase4 I know, also a show like this would make MLP even more excaptable + grant even more new viewers
poor little green guts
Lil_B: I'd love to see more of it.
this can obly end it great success
5:21 AM
I hope it doesnt over heat D
Place them inside, I'd say
Dat Heavy Quote
If this lifts, I'll be amazed
next time eat a salad... ya dumb bib wearin dope
Brb, coursework.
TAHNK YOU! *Curls up into a ball next to Fluttershy* *Yawns*
streamers!
*Thank
Malavolent I have not seen it, sadly :/
what sumica said XD
Needs moar derpy.
Moar pylons
Lil_B: its dangerous teratory though, get the wrong writer and they'll just make a 'darker' mlp where things get killed and whatnot, completly missing the point
I dub this Design... @Sumica Challenger
it wont
needs moar fuel
are you just straight up building a tower into space
Challenger... Nothing could possibly go wrong.
sumi your rockets arent symetrical
Challumbia
inb4 this somehow works
Sure.
they are symetrical enough, damnit XD
Challumbiatanic
go foar iet
in after we mourn the dead
JUST LAUNCH THE FUCKING THING.
try it try it
Phase4 right, I don't wann see "Michael bays: MLP"... I mean, i would love to see really good action and everything, but no death and gore and sadness everywhere...
eh watev
What Thorn said
put boosters on the boosters
The_Greener: watch your language
Lil_B: http://derpy.me/OGFXd What do you think about it?
Is Bronystate going to marathon the mlp episodes before season 3 starts?
IT DIDNT COLLAPE!
Holy. Crepe.
boooo eve reference
My god, its an abomination
Michael Bay's My Little Pony: Regin of Buttercup Sprinkles!
oooooo
Uh-oh...:D
holy GOD
oh dis is wrong way
ITS WORKING
NOT ENOUGH GYROS!
SWEET JESUS ITS NOT BLOWING UP
wtf
omg omg omg
Has science gone too far?
It is using up way too much fuel.
is it going to crash
hahahaha
kabooooommmm
:D
ahaghahahahjahahah
Oh wait, nevermind.
Hahaha:D
Lulz.

I'm laughing so hard right now Sumica... that was brilliant
MAKE A PARTY CANON
My sides :D
I'm crying, AGAIN :D
Yeah, it had some trouble
:P
no worries, everything working as planned
Hahaha, that was funny as hay.:D
SRBs are probably too high to eject cleanly/
XD
It's funny, because real astronauts died that way
see guys it was perfectally fine
It was the best crash I've ever seen. :o
needs more conectors maybe/ Sumica
ikr
I noticed that
Sweet jesus.
I have eyes you know.
one too many liquid tanks
That it did
more fuel
IT GOT OFF THE PAD
Sumica: ikr
I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT AT ALL.
amazing
And it flexed liek a freaking snake!
:[
BAZINGA
and regarding the faces on the dearly departed.... that's the way I'd want to die... on the best roller coaster ride EVER!!!!
WHEN DID IT GET OFF THE PAD?
6_9
:3
I WASN'T LOOKING
Bazinga. I was.
Thorn a few minutes ago
Dat royal canterlock
#
HMM.
Inquisitor: last night before I went to sleep, it was Nittany_Discord playing this. So somewhere in the wee hours of the morning, Sumica decided to take over with the exact same game?
More=the answer
ITS NEARLY FUCKING COLLAPSING DUE TO WEIGHT.
it wasnt the rocket it was derpy driving it
Hey, Sumi! Turn on your pings! :D
Still room for more!
Just do 6 way symetry
my video has been stuck this entire time
Thorn: less caps please
He's been playin it for a little while now Kandarihu
Sorry.
Ninjazz: Hey Ninjazz, apriciate ALL the ponies!
Sucks for you, ClutterShy. :3
Ze pings.
inb4 ping spam
Om: Hmmmnah. :D

Hahaha:D
look at that thing
WOAH
boom
JESUS
Sh-yay-. :P
GLORIOUS
lol
the most amazing thing ever
Malavolent that looks really good. I personaly thought more of the animation-stile of Teen-Titans or the new Ninja-Turtles Cartoon, but if done right, I think everything should be able to work
Kaboo
WOAH
HWOOOAH
i just don't know what went wrong
:[YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME! :(if thats fine with you
Sumica: That was great
LOL.
Like that? Sumica
then it explodes
Relaunch!
:D
/me dies
Whahhhh Whahhhh Whaaahhhhhh
or just collapses on it's own!!!!
unstable
fail
o_o
ROFL
Wow...:D
:D
EDGE of stability
coool
bahahahahhaahhahaah:D
Sumica: You should play this game more often.
Lil_B: That is possible, I'd like to see more anime style, it would look great in my opinion. But hey, it looks good the way it is now.
Sumica: Perhaps lower the volume of the game?
HA1
Yep.
Rofl.
yay
Dude, be careful
yay
You are running out of Astronauts
the bottom rocket decided it wanted to be a drill
06tyesh
Just put a tiny vessel with 1 thruster and see how much it flies?
can't we see more explosions
Needs more rockets.
THEN LETS MAKE MORE!
mica connectors
06the people from the place where i had a jab interview called back
lol
killed 9 little green men in less than a minute Sumi
Sumica: just dump the first stage on the pad
*makes more astronauts*
How about attaching the three sections together?
Your survival and sucessful launce rides on the edge of quantum brownian motion variances. :) Enjoy your ride! :$
EXPLOSIONS.
06i can come on a 2nd interview, and have to bring my BAnk ID and ID cards
OWAOH
Aww.
IT WORKS
/me mah ears
06so that is good news
Wat....
uhhhhhhh
This won't end well.
WUT
Those little green men are called Kerbs
LOWER THE VOLUMEEEE
I was expectnf an exploasion.
That is impossible!:D
Malavolent I don't want them to change the show XD, i want them to make a second show with a different design and keep both :)
we have liftoff
volume what now?
dafuq is dat mothership?!
oh mai
Wait for it.
Wait for iit
this can only end well
OH WOW
ALL AT ONCE
Aaaaand no thrust
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
this might survive long enough
Dear god...
also, I'm away for now, I have to do a little bit of work :/
Lil_B: Sure, I wasn't talking about changing the current show, the fandom will still try to make different animation styles.
it nearly movex xD
Sweet jesus its actually working
I never knew a fanime would make me laugh so much
its glowing
ITS IN SPACE
too heavy!
No shit
ITS- ITS IN SPACE1
Spell-of-Gaming can you PM me the link please
Phase4: well atleast hes still going up
Phase4: Nonsense, it simply needs more rockets!
wat.
it has enough fuel to go to mars and back
SRBs are more powerful than Liquid rockets
Hey, I heard you like lift off. So we gave you liftoff after we got liftoff
So, is this going to run out of fuel?
it will leave the atmosphere
its the weight
hahahahahahaa
That's why they are called boosters.
Have a stomache
its one fat momma
this is exactly why we use liquid /after/ the solids
are we going to equestrian moon?
Bye, see you in max 2 hours
Always positive mica
See ya, Lil_B
Cya Lil_B
You use SRBs in your early stages, to break the gravitational bond. Then liquid to propel once in motion
that's why using liquid for the heavy work is a bad idea
bye Lil_B
oh bai Lil_B
later Lil_B
Is it in space now?
lawl
bye Lil_B
trolololol
If you get out the atmosphere with this load, you will go apeshit far

o.o
Or...or not.
Yeah, we're not going to the moon.
SORRY WOONA

Great! Thank you =3
Lambo: It's worth a try ;)

Ah well.
SORRY WOONAA
It's going to reach about...180k

SPAACE!
lets hope Vordox
SPAAAAAAAAAAACEEEE
Phase4: Phase4` didja get DC'd

I think you can lift off the throttle now
no, two clients
Well fine then Sumi: How about....280k :P
Save a bit of fuel
Wow. ;_;
ah
yay
woooooah
Vordox: he did 300k before
Oh feck it...
This is going beyond 500k...
do you plan on them coming back
I think you've left the field already
Vordox: more like 2.8 M i think
So... is there any specific goal in this game?
I just wanted to know who to talk to about possibly having some Magicka streamed on here while the 75% off sale is still going on.
DEAR GOD
you'd figure that momentum in space would mean that after a certain point the gravitational field of the planet COULDN'T snag you
mother of all celestia :O
And rescue Luna, right?
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooal!
and blow things up
but Inquisitor, gravity exists between all objects
ggeeeeeee!
no matter the distiance
You're tilting...
zoom in, Sumica
but the Further away from Bodies the weaker the field Rain
olol
whys the one on the far left scared
XD
to the sun!
tooooooo the sun
yay! :)
yay
TO THE SUN!
yay
to the sun doesn't quite have the same ring to it
gravitational force decreases with the square root of the distance
to the sun
GO TO THE SUN

oh gosh look at that distance meter
and it's almost 4am =p
so what happens to them now
SPAAAAAAACE
I've got to get this game :D
Stare at sun. YOur eyes can take it
remember the "save a bit of fuel!" advice?

Kelps. Kelps. Kelps. Kelps.
middle guy's still high on endorphens
oh god stop!
sure they're lost in space but the middle guy took a lot of pot bedore going
EXACTLY. ^_^
alexxm: It's for SCIENCE
Sumica: I noticed that the K changed to an M when you passed 999999 Kilometers
hahhahahhahahaha LOL
/me cant breath:D
How's the Orbit?
Middle guy takes a disaster to make sad
And that place is air-tight, too. :3
lolwut
They're gonna smell his farts FORRRREEEEVVVEEEEERRRRRRRRR
Now it's Megameters or something
dem faces
Yeah that's..errr...
lawl
Bye yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaals!
More Time Warp?
Sumica: check your orbit again?
Eventually, you're going to crash into Moon, Sumica.
XD
Kandarihu: It's in Kilometers...
bye Om.
Sumica: It's an orbit, there is no landing for you anymore...
it's just a jump to the left
your best chance is to crash into the sun
bye Om
earth is out of range
Cya Om...
Turn time warp on
34 days... they've starved to death
Damn it.
Time warp to 1000000x?
34 days and they are running low on cheese poofs
dang those orgasm can survive
ah, thats how your loosing speed
Land on the MOON, or sun. Whatever
Very_Silly_Filly: well, it had to change his scale now that he's exceed a million kilometers
-_-
dat fail typing
Dang
Moving back to Aphelion point. ;_;
Dat middle guy is my hero
wonder if we orbit enough, if we'll impact the moon
inb4 Sumica just lets it go and eventually slams into the earth
little alien guy hey did you pack food. Little space dude 2 woops, little space 3 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLUTTERSHY

Space, The Endless Frontier.
I swear middle guy is high. :3
They are green.... Photosynthesis. Recycled water... They are DOOMED TO FOREVER!!! :O
alexxm: They're fecked XD
cannibalism breaks out
Middle guy isn't high
they are freaking because they are lost in space
He had an accident at birth
Lol. ^_^
the astronauts have resorted to cannibalism, after smelling the wind #2 passed for the first week, his legs were the first to be sacrificed for the continued survival
The results make him have only 1 emotion: Happy
The middle one farted in their space suits
There can't be enough snacks in that command module to last them months. They should be dead of starvation by now.
they don't need food
Kandarihu: Don't bring physics into a game with Physics. XD
they live off fear
just open the air locks and end their misery
hahahahha Arentius
Mica: Now you wish you had some more fuels? :P

scootalo the magical chicken is the only food they have
LAWL
night Dark_of_Max
You're about to come into contact with something
how? friction?
one half of the orbit you loose speed the other half you gain speed ...
I wouldn't suppose you can name your rockets in this game, can you? Might I suggest Buster Machine 0?
Aaaaaand you're at Aphelion. :P
I didn't doubt you
Lawl
Sumica: you should try hitting the sun next time
I wanred you that you would escape
I never doubted you
chances to crash into the earth?
well after your rocket tried to become a drill.... we did have our misgivings
but it didnt go anywhere
Kelps.
just 3 little aliens afraid for their lives
Awwwwww! But Space Core!
This was a triumph.
THIS IS BORING NOW.

CometSurge: No, that was the none original pan of the clip.

I swear, that Applejack is practically behaving like a real pony might respond to everything that happened to her.
G1 apple jack is a dork :p
08,01Kandarihu: eating hay?
00,10Thanks, night all
Such a silly pony!
Kandarihu what do you mean
Rain: Who do you think you are, Kevin from Ed edd n eddy?
08,01i stroked a horse a few days ago
Dork in a good way :|
08,01it was warm
I used to ride horses all the time >_>
08,01what?
I meant as in looking on in utter confusion at the whole scene until she was out of the water.
08,01you guys just assume everything i say is innuendo...
00,10I horsed a stroke
08,01well, most of the time it is
Ok, seriously... where can i see the Take me On MLP video?
ugh. Why can't I sleep normal?
but then one day I spawned an irational fear of them and cant get close to horses anymore :<
08,01flutter_spin: what time is it for you?
Big_Macintosh_1992: youtube
6AM
so how many people here have gotten balloon party?
08,01flutter_spin: drink a load of caffeine
I was tempted to shoot this horse who kept harrasing the road
08,01that'll make you tired
00,02Vordox, you online?
Alright guys! For everyone who doesn't have it yet, Magicka is on a 75% off sale for 6 more hours.
Phase4: Eyyup
feck sleep :P
I don't like coffee
Vordox: No ta
00,02lol
welp its 7:15am nite ya'll see yas later
later Spectrum_Plush.
Coffee doesn't agree with me
Kandarihu, I would get it, but it doesnt like my graphics card, even though it is more than capable of running the game :|
08,01my god, you lot have as bad sleeping patterns as i do
bye Spectrum_Plush
I couldn't sleep. It was like 2:30AM before I could sleep
kk cya Spectrum_Plush
Bye Spectrum_Plush
I think imma go to sleep now see ya guys later :)
00,10oh I know, i can leave stream running
Rain: Even if it has enough memeory, it might not support SSE2 or 3 or whatever
I have crap sleep patterns.
bye OneTrickPony
See ya OneTrickPony
/me sleepily hugs chat
And I have to go out at 8AM
I blame time zone travel.
me
tooo
I blame the world for being round. :P
i can stream.......a banana
00,10enjoy
Rain: it seems to have a problem with my computer as well.
ugh
i blame bronystate for being awesome
it burns
00,02XD
Thanks Sumi. :D
08,01Vordox: every processor since 2000 (pentium 4 era) has supported SSE2.
Suddenly the hub
08,01wait
kk thanks Sumica
08,01i mean whoever said that
08,01Very_Silly_Filly:
08,01oh, damn
08,01i fail at irc
/me pushes Sumica to bed "sleeeeeeep, you silly colt"
So that's why I'd rather have this on discount than not.
00,02Sumica, i was about to take over but this is more fun XD
00,10nah have fun Phase4 i was just beeing suilly
My graphics card is absolute dogshit
O.o
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: yes it does
WHOA
CLOSE
whoa
00,10was making sure capture card was working for later
Ha she almost died.......wait
Almost DEATH IN A GIRL SHOW?!
00,02ah, k
08,01trust me, unless you're using some kind of VIA clone, it does
08,01or ARM, in which case SSE2 is completely irrelevant
I know it doesn't run games from 2000
Vordox, that happens all the time in many shows >_>
Rain: Yeah but Huuuub!
like when Twi had a piano dropped on her head
after an anvil
and a cart
00,02stream is up
Phase4: I thought you were too busy to play around and stuff. D:
Hey phase
00,02i was earlier
My Laptop has the RAM and the Processor, but the graphics card is so bad it can't run freaking games as early as 2000
da wub
Oh god
Phase4: Team Fortress 2 time again?:)
Streamception
Again
08,01oh, the graphics card is nothing to do with SSE
00,02TheRainbowDash, Nope
TF2, LEFT 4 DEAD 2 or what? :P
Ooooh!
L4D2!
OMW!
Ahh, okay
Oh, Left for Dead 2.
L4D2
08,01SSE is on the processor
Alright. I need to give this laptop some cooldown time. I'll probably be back in a couple of hours.
If only kirz was here.
Ho, shit, Phase4!
L4D2?
I thought all the SSE crap was ossociated with graphics cards because the system requires always put it in the GFX
Later Kandarihu
bye Kandarihu
08,01also, if your grpahics card has 32 megs of RAM or more, it should support games from 2000
terraria? TERRARIA!
my little ponies shooting is magic
GP4
I hear L4D2 Trailer
That sound in the BG XD
I can't run it because I only have a 64 MB GFX
But I happen to notice that Magicka is sadly missing from Phase4's game list.
hi everyone. phew.. So after seeing Promethius I went and saw Alien and Aliens with friends
ughh.... 5 days of making music non stop....ME IS VERY TIRED
00,02Kandarihu, ikr :(
It can't run Terraria, it can't run Fall0out
You know it's on discount, right?
5 days :D dude take a rest
Phase4: What client is that?
I need a Express graphics for it
Phase4: Going for a coop to see the game, or Versus for mass failure? :P
08,01well, SSE2 is to do with parallel data processing, and imrpoves gaming performance, but it's a feature of the processor
CupcakeWarrior: that looks like X-Chat to me.
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: what graphics card do you have?
A shitty GMA x4500
Phase4: You playing L4D2? Can i join?
It's Integrated of course, as it's a laptop
lol this minecraft server just got 24 core cpu with 92 gb ddr ram
But I have an Express slot in my Laptop
08,01a GMA x4500 should be able to run games from recent eras...
00,02thats more gore than i usualy tollerate
08,01i think maybe you have somethign set up wrong
[wklmjhe]JRP2234: :o
I still say, in comparrison to TF2, TF2 is more gore.
Most games from like 5-8 years ago need about 128 to 256 Mb
Phase4: stream don't capture the game.
Phase4: Yeah, no stream
00,02oh cool, borderless window mode
Vordox: I suppose you're right.
Phase4: You can turn the gore down
00,02i know it didnt, nothing much i could do though
LOL... I only have a GeForce FX 5200. My computer sucks.
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, THANK GOD
00,02i knew they nerfed it in aus but didnt know if the steam version was
You can set it to low so it's only textures
Yeah there's an option for that somewhere
evga gtx 240 is good for some games
00,02ok...
00,02i've never played l4d
In low, I don't think there's gibs unless pipe bomb
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: anything DX9 or under should work with that card
and its cheap
00,02kerbal finished downloading ^_^
08,01and it's apparently DX10 compatible
08,01but very, very slow
More SPAAAAACE?
and apparent, I've quadruple the minimum requirements
00,02wheres the gore option?
00,02there it is
Very_Silly_Filly: what you working with
options -> multiplayer -> gore
It's not on Video I don't think
00,02gore: low
00,02:)
Right, here's my laptops specs
00,02stream working?
YEP
Yes
Got visuals and all
ya huh
00,02Vordox, you host?
1.8 Gh/z dual core celeron processor, GMA x4500 GFX integrated and 4Gb ram
thats some prime ass menu navigation right there
give him time
Hosting Terraria atm, just let me check
Also, there's dedicated servers
00,02i think the x4500 was one of the first good ones
So no need for a outside host
Just create a new game.
I'll join if I may? :)
My tower has 1.8 GH/z dual core pentium 4 processor with an ATI radeon x6400 HD PRO and 1GB ram
00,02k
00,02this cant be that hard
Err Depends on difficulty
THer'es 4 I think
Very_Silly_Filly: thats pretty good
Set it to easy if you want pussy difficulty
My tower NEEDS more RAM
Campign is recommended
easy is like pasifism mode
1GB can't play shit nowadays
Der.
Wait, create a game
Derp*
Play with Friends
Create new Campaign
00,024 slots avaliable
:o
3 slots, with you :P
I really need to get L4D2....
:'(
More people interested? =3
I have L4D2, but my tower can't run it
00,02anyone else got l4d2?
I'll join you guys :3
00,02i'll invite ^_^
Ninjazz: You had L4D2?
I have it.
Yes.
So diddutz Phase4 Vordox
Time for my noms, be right back.:D
One more spot.
Okay, join then Ninjazz.
Cya soon, NommyDash.
00,02should i spam invites :P
XD
Very_Silly_Filly: Im working with 3 GH/Z with a i7 dual core 0900k, ASUS Zi250, 4 - 1 gig ddr3 ram and a Evga 570 gtx graphics
Hang on... Steam being finicky again.
They can join you and you can invite them
Do you have diddutz steam or Ninjazz ?
HiImSpike: Oh bugger off, you make me jelly D:
Steam.
Yes.
I has it.
So many friends, Phase4 I'm jealous.. :(
00,02someone just added me
00,02slots filled ^_^
00,02Capn_Gavn, ohai
Hold on, is that 1Gb of ram or 4?
noooo its my processor is only better evga sucks your graphics is way better
Who is Caaptain?
:P
hai
My graphics is brilliant, yeah
Spent 200 quid on it:3
Already taken the slot Ninjazz :<
Very_Silly_Filly: :)
hey Capn_Gavn hows your day been
hello Capn_Gavn
Vordox: Oh well... I blame Steam. :(
If I get the money, I'll probably build a laptop
kool :$
Try and fit 8-16 GB in, with mabye ani5 processor
Phase4: There is ONE thing with Official
00,02?
You can get bad servers and edited, modded and original servers.
(Ala TF2)
Vordox: That's on Best avalible
true their is no difference between i5 and i7
00,02ah
its been fine., mum had a guy over about renting the spare room
Offical is Valve server
You sure Very_Silly_Filly ? I've had some weird times when I got into something really weird. =/
00,02HiImSpike, there are differences, i7 is quad and has the virt extentions
i7 has a small difference, but the price is retarded
00,02Mostly the same though
Very_Silly_Filly the price isnt that bad if your after the advantages it offers
Chrysalis: Like what?
00,02and i5 is most likley a slightly faulty i7
Well, processor speed is fine for agaming atm
but for most users those advantages are negligable
a snail coul'd move faster than my loading bar -.-
Phase4: True but when coming to puff processing power the core is about the same depend but k processong power you get
:p'd
what was coach standing on
hey, i only needed 1 hour for the work :D
Phase4: Since you're a noob, I'd reccomend melee
I wish I had L4D2 uncensored...
Fucking germany
Lil_B what work were you doing
Could only buy censored version
00,02k
things like cache size are generally bigger on the 7s
Lambo is the steam version censored
alexxm it is in certain countries
kiddy land
alexxm: In germany you can only buy censored version of L4D2. At some point I will rebuy the game in UK or Austria or Switzerland, so I can replace the key with the support
Chrysalis odd i thought it'd be one version on steam
its because they dont have a proper "adult" rating in certain countries
as such they need to censor to sell at all
Mh, would you guys take MSI or EVGA for graphics card supplier?
brb
EVGA
MSI are a VERY good brand for cards
mine take some serious abuse and run fine
alexxm removing weeds, sweeping the walkway infront of my house, cleaning the floors on the first floor
EVGA has got this insane warranty deal. But I don't know whether that is any good in the end
Lambo how censored is it anyways
cards burn out in 2-4 years anyway warrentee or no
alexxm: VERY
alexxm: No gore. Zombies disappear. They don't looks limbs, or open bodies
Next to no gore
blood is removed, persistant bodies
I fucking hate it
Lambo /) from germany :D
I am an adult, and this government treats me like an idiot
true but the evga has more standing gaming time because the cool of the card wont make the game lag over a period of time
that's why I never buy games.
censorship
Lambo: i know that feel, australia is the same
hah "standard gaming time"
what a useless metric
So, whenever I be able to buy L4D2 uncensored for 5-10 bucks, I will gladly do it
We don't even know what censored means
they never test under actual gaming environments
I guess one reason I hate britain is because half of my owned guns are illegal to own :/
meaning it want lag to the heat of the card
Or take out to public rather
theyll run the card at maybe 70% tops
I wanted to buy the orange box 15 before my 18th birthday... i wasn't allowed to :/
how many guns do you have Very_Silly_Filly ?
I have 13
15 days*
True.
:O why?
asdasdasdasdasda
I like to collect
lol Phase4.
Most of them are quite old
crap
fair enough i guess
xRabidSmurfx: except when it comes to uncovered skin...your people are almost as prude as the arabs
I have a 1940's luger
From WWII
cool
to be honest, i probably would probably turn of the gore in L4D2 to get a better performance
Lil_B: It doesn't affect performance too much
l4d2 is both old and well written
Very_Silly_Filly wow... I don'Ät know much about weapons, but i do know how a luger looks
Of course Left 4 Dead 2 was one of the few games I could not get from Amazon.de Uk imported
you really shouldnt have any issues with performance
Gladly I got the Orange Box from the UK from Amazon.de
This game can run, but it takes 5 years to load everything
more the lag
Chrysalis every time i play L4D2 my PC gets kinda loud...
/me sobs in a corner.'
Chrysalis every time i play L4D2 my PC gets kinda loud...
Today Is the last day where I can return the MSI 560 gtx ti...
Lil_B well duh, all your cooling will spin up
/me hugs CrazyCherry whats the matter
Hehe
why so sad CrazyCherry?
If gore was on, thered be headless zombies everywhere
i run 7 fans in my computer, how loud do you think that gets?
EV'RYDAY I'M SHUFFLING!!!!
Chrysalis i know.. i mean in comparison to my other games
/me shuffles.
Chrysalis: I'm hoping to get water cooling for mine
which are?
CrazyCherry: omg me too!
Language isn't a major problem, well not as much as naked flesh. I saw an episode of south park the other day that said shit 162 times is what i the counter said
They need to hurry up and make water cooling for laptops
they wont ever do that
Chrysalis: what brand of tower you have
watercooling is definately not portable
true
HiImSpike i built it myself
nice
They'll make one ventually
I mean think how small storage is getting
No!
BRB Everypony going to relocate!!!
Very_Silly_Filly its a physics thing
and how hot laptops are :D
they can't
haahha==a
Man, I seek the day when I will only have SSDs in my pc
^
Lambo you can do that now
if your willing to payu
$$$
120 gb SSD is cheap already. But anything above is expensive as fuck
Chrysalis newer games are: Tropico 4, Port Royal 3, Portal 2, Amnesia, Duke Nukem Forever and ANNO 2070
give it a year or 2
Lil_B none of those are intensive though
Amnesia is terrifying
Shit, I want Anno 2070. I hope they will put it on Sale for 10 bucks later this year
Zombies are people too 3:
its a good game lambo
i did enjoy 2070
Anyone who hasn't already, buy the Humble Indie Bundle V. Pay more than the avergae and you get Lone Survivor
we should try to setup a big vs match
Awesome game
I can't run shit on this humble on ratthlebox
is 2070 that city building game
Chrysalis ANNO 2070 can get very intensive when I turn things up, i have it on the lowest possible setting... I really just need a new PC
or just upgrade it
HiImSpike: yep
kool
My Tower is very quiet
I can run every game I own on my pc right now on fullest settings
just see where your WEI is lowest and swap in a new one
Only has 1 fan, and it can keep the whole damn thing cool
Damn consoles are keeping me back
I've given up with consoles
what sort of hardware you got Lambo ?
Lambo theyv been holding PC back for years
Chrysalis my current PC as a cheap pre-Build one, it doesn't like upgrades, I will make the new one so i can Upgrade it easily
main advice, dont be cheap on the case
Xbox 360 runs L4D at a shit framrate
Only runs it at 45 FPS
d3rb: i5 2600k, msi 560 gtx ti (for now, maybe return it later today), 8 gb ram
while it doesnt seem important, a big case it essential
nice nice
nice set up Lambo
Would cooling fins affect PC temperature?
Phase4: I'd reccomend pills
not really
But my most precious things are my Beyerdynamic DT 770 pro
mine WAS good....when i got it :D
00,02k
Love the headphones. Although it gets creepy playing Dead Space
Mine was good when I got it
one with fan grills on the top will help more
good morning everypony
mornin
Good morning
hellp rdibp
g'day rdibp
morning, rdibp.
Morning rdibp
Lol, you lot are terrible
i want l4d2 so bad :(
HiImSpike in ANNO games, you have a lot of islands and you conolize them, you can trade with other towns, you can make war, but the main objective is to build a city on one island and manage the production of rescurces and roducts
boom baby
lol :D
I may get that new Asus mainboard with Thunderbolt, in a few weeks
hi rdibp ;)
Press E to close and open stuff, Phase4 =3
00,02but its soo hard :'(
Phase4: You're doing great!
00,02gore is still higher than i'd like
Phase4: Your team is so terrible :D
I still need a new PSU
Im still running a motherboard with ddr2 ffs, damn you lambo
Success!
00,02XD
325 wattage is definitly not enough
U can do it Phase4
Phase4: Nowhere near is what it is on high
Lil_B: thanks for the info I will watch some video of it later
Very_Silly_Filly: Low filly low :P
High has you blowing zombies in half
at lease 500 watts
I think that is the reason that one time my graphics went down horribly. Just not enough wattage
the quality is better
My laptop fan is crap
I need to get a new one
yeah
Keeps emergency overheating power off
when you go for wattage, NEVER go for one thats just big enough
more is ALWAYS better
always go for 50% ABOVE what you need
ive got 700
Be careful though
You could fry it
future proof
youll get more stable voltages and all your hardware will run longer
HiImSpike i run a 1k
i got 850 watt...i have yet to fry anything
Very_Silly_Filly nope
I don't know if i should wait untill DDR4 RAM next year or build one later this year :/... and should it run Win7 or Linux... all the choices :(
Does anyone know any good grahics cards for an express slot?
can never go to hi Chrysalis
:)
Lil_B go for ddr3, your harddrive will be your biggest bottleneck anyway
higher watt power supplies look cooler too
most important part
or corsair is also good
little expensive but good
Or you could just get a Falcon
true
All you need is around 2000 quid :)
d3rb quite a few are modular as well, which is really nice for airflow
Chrysalis I know, and the HD Prices still have to drop further, i was also thinking about putting a small SSD drive for the operating systhem in there, but i think i would blow my budget then
<3 modular, so much neater
you are a very silly filly Very_Silly_Filly :$
Gonna buy me a main SSD soon. 120gb for 100 bucks
Buy an external hard drive, they are cheap
ive got a 320 gig ssd
I will need SSDs soon, anyway, for my new camera
And just open it up and take out the hard drive
Then I will TONS of SSD
but thats just silly! :)
Very_Silly_Filly its still cheaper to buy the drives straight up
I bought a 500 Gb XHD for 50 quid
Chrysalis: are you working with 2 particions
Camera with internal SSd recorder -> http://www.blackmagic-design.com/products/blackmagiccinemacamera/design/
dont need partitions, i have 3x1TB drives in my machine
I had a 69 gig hard drive in my old laptop
3 t that huge man
damn, now THATS a camera
Having a Tape drive would also be neat, I have a Ton of Music, and a friend of mine recently lost 50% of his music because 2 of his older hard-drives died
My dads has around 1.5 Tb
My father told me he once paid 500 bucks for 5mb drive...
ive got 1.5 terabyte too
just replace harddrives every other year, they are cheap enough and data is priceless
d3rb: You mean, porn is priceless
all i know is my computer is a piece of crap
and a 1terabyte external
exactly
Lambo: My dad paid about 100 quid for a 50 Mb hard drive for his PC :)
haa bit old
I think this was in the 90's
I would say
Man, I wish I could go back in time with a Playstation 3 and show them early gamers our games...
Lambo: What, and get CoD in 1990.
No thanks.
you would be rich
thing is when you get to these sorts of capacities, you usually use it all

i wish i still had my first pc, pentium 1 166mhz, 32meg of ram and 1.9 gig hdd

Only recently I played Metal Gear Solid 1 on an emulator for the first time. It. Was. Awesome.

Sega is mine
I still have my N64 my first own console :'(
Evil_Spike: I was 10 years old, what could I do
The vectrex is from 1982

I still remember playing the Atari 2600
And I'm only 20

Obvious troll is obvious
Also nab the spas 12
It's an autoshotgun
Very_Silly_Filly: So are Left 4 Dead games fun?
CometSurge: Yeah
I'm also 20, I remeber that I played Donkey Kong Country when i was 6 once... othet then that, I mostly played N64 and some DOS games when i was small...
Phase4: I'd reccomend the tactical shotgun
It's an autoshotgun
zelda is s0oooooooooooo good
sumerpan 64
I actually loved it
Majoras Mask is best Zelda
CARE. BEARS. SHOWING. IN. ONE. MINUTE. SWAG.
So we are watching Care Bears?
My favourite zelda is OoT 3D, then probably Skyward sword
I am still not sure whether I should go for a PS3 finally. I still need to buy new PSU, more hard drive space, and one or two new monitors
sawg indeed rd5000
swag**
Skyward sword was really good
Skyward Sword has serious issues
Very_Silly_Filly: can't get them with this old laptop :D
But tedious as hell
No exploration WHATSOEVER!
Very_Silly_Filly Scyward Sword was good, i even played it again in hero-mode XD
mine was ocarina of time on the 64
I played links awakening
that was ok
Very_Silly_Filly:
Unfortunately console architecture is still so very different, so we can not have us PS3 emulators...
Twilight Princess is still my favourite Zelda game
But they are already using PC grpahics cards
08,01Lambo: well, we can
didnt like the swimming and riding
08,01really easily, actually
08,01but they'd be hella slow
I wish they'd hurry up and hack the 3DS, I cannot afford 35 quid per game
Time: 8 am EST/7 am CST/5 am PST. Guess what's showing on The Hub now.
true
Care Bears?
Forget what i said about MM, Link's Awakening, my first ever Zelda game on my own BW gameboy ;) THE MEMORYS!
08,01Lambo: that's what i said; they'd be hella slow
home improvement
?
In 10 years we will have decent PS3 emulators...
You need around 8-16 Gb of ram to run a PS3 emu
08,01as always, i made no claims to decency
you got the sd card
Anypony ever played Mole Mania on GB?
Course I have the SD card, I need it to play
my first gameboy game was Pokemon Yellow Edition I think - or Link's awakening
08,01Lambo: simply emulating the architecture isn't a problem. it's emulating it at a usable speed that's the problem. and yes, in 10 years, we might have hardware fast enough for it.
oh that reminds me i left my ps3 on
sorry ive got something called R4 which lets me play all games
My first Gameboy game was Tetris
Mole Mania was my first Gameboy game
pokemon for me
08,01either that, or do some kind of JIT translation on the fly
It is a highly underrated game, Mole Mania
The 3DS can't play 3DS games that are hacked
Mine was pokemon blue
Will somepony stream ponies at 10:00 later via The Hub? I want to see live television ponies where it's finally catchable for me. (It's at 10 pm here.)
what about pokemons?
08,01but that's be... kinda crazy
I even got threw the Color dungeon in Links awakening DX in on my old gameboay XD
I still have my old gameboy with tetris.
then...buy a ps3?
I even still have my old savestate, with 497 deaths
So do I
You can hack it to use the R4, but you can only play DS games on it
d3rb: Yes, but still need to buy some other things
But it's a Gameboy Pocket
08,01Lambo: then you either need a lot of money, or a time machine
But there's a number of 3DS games I want
08,01the latter kinda implies the former, though
In Aussie, Saturday ponies are at midnight.
make a money machine
And get arrested?
08,01i've always wanted to try my hand at forging money
Which part of Australia though, eastern or western states?
ok make an invisible money machine
Eastern. West is at 10 pm.
Forging GBP is pretty difficult
08,01i think forging coins would be easier
aud is pretty hard to forge
Which is for me a good thing, living in Perth
d3rb that prints invisible 100$ bills?
Forging US bills is quite easy
Euro bills is much harder
nah printing is visible but the machine isnt
British notes have foil in between the tissues
But there's only 1 layer of paper
If it's 10 am Eastern, What time would it be in the UK? SWAG.
R-Dash5000, I'm assuming you're TheRainbowDawn, right?
They banned £50 notes because they were too often forged
No. Swag.
On the bronies Australia forum
This was before they put foil in them
It's June 9th. June 9th is 6-9. 6-9 equals 6_9.

Lil_B: :$

I think
Source please
Airpuff yes, as long as the Alcohol doesn't somehow hinders something, it should be possible
Omg *-*
so are there still only 13 episodes or have more been ordered
Airpuff you would neet to let it that off a while, and then its only a matter of how much suger/water/beer, you need
let it stand off*
Ooh, granny launcher
6_9
so all the Carbonacid (the bubbles) get out
If MLP will have 79 episodes, just like 2 other shows Lauren Faust made, Season 3 will have 26 episodes or there will be a season 4 with 13 and a movie.
Lil_B: i see
R-Dash5000: link please
Phase4: Never take special infected alone
It's asking for death
00,02k
sometimes i think i do to much research when i see that I know more about MLP than a full brony :/
It's just my theory.
Take some pills, Phase4
SWUG.
00,02not sure what they do
Give you 50 temperary hp
Basiccally, short term hp
CRUSH. KILL. DESTROY... Uh, what next?
R-Dash5000: Full respect to you.:D
The answer is...... SWAG.
swag
R-Dash5000: Hay right it is.
Needs to be 20% more fabulous.
Will the saturday ponies be streamed today at 10:00 am EST?

Guys, here's a question: Should I get heroes of Ruin for the 3DS? I tried the demo yesterday and I found it to be pretty good.
Very_Silly_Filly, if you like it, go for it.
whats it about Very_Silly_Filly
It's basically a hack/slash for the 3ds
A mixture of WoW and D3
oh, I remember this place.
TAAAAAAAAAANK!
This bit is retarded on Expert
love playing as Nick.
mostly because I know I'm like Nick irl.
I'm like the most unseriously serious guy I know

Basically, I talk serious, like I'm not serious
Very_Silly_Filly hows your wrist doing

You thought the game would be scary, Phase4 ?
00,02Vordox, yes and no
I still remember your first reaction. XD
"BIG THING"
00,02all i knew is it was some type of team survival game
00,02XD
ill tell you what game is scary... amnesia
00,02yeah, it was coming after me so i was like "Screw dis"
Don't underestimate the special infected.
They CAN tear you apart. :P
so anyway what are we watching
i keep hearing about this amnesia game, is it good?

flutterfriend: Phase4 FIRST encounter with the game L4D2
hey Sylandest hows your day been

good sylandest
i got constantly molestd by the specials in that game
So Phase is streaming L4D2? Tat game is goooood
Tanks are bastards on Expert
morning, Sylandest.
Hi Sylandest
d3rb: If you want it to scare you, it will, if you do not want to be scared, meh
/me hugs everypony good morning
alexxm: I only just woke up, so i suppose good so far, hehe
so the game itself is ok or average but scary?
WallDives: have I missed much while I was out?
It's not scary
same here sylandest
d3rb: nONONONO the game is FRICKING scary
d3rb: It's GREAT for what it is, but it's ...kinda ruined by the fans
Sylandest, not really.
i just dont get scared easily
despite my name
<---
lol :D ok i'll keep that in mind. i know very little about it so that may be an advantage
d3rb: Then the game will WRECK YOU and SCARE you
It won't
Honestly
I played L4D1 at the age of 11
oi, Airpuff! You manage to find that charger cable? :D
Vordox how scary is it
i'm gonna see how much it is on steam now,
And thats apparently darker
alexxm: Depends, how do you play games
Sylandest: indeed o.o
lol this is definatly not as entertaining as the stuff like 2 weeks ago
After i fell asleep o.o
Very_Silly_Filly: L4D was the scary game, L4D2 is the "in the brighter things"
depends on what game it is Vordox
alexxm: Amnesia
L4D has less contrast and colours and everything
But it still wasn't sccary
Airpuff: haha, go figure. You didn't miss too much, though you still missed a couple good laughs here and there
L4D? dude i played that game in like 6 hours and didnt jump once
Over at BronyTV, The royal wedding is showing.
Sylandest: Aw.. :'(
/me hugs Airpuff
brony tv?
Good Morning Kids! :D
/me hugs Sylandest back
Airpuff: we'll just play some more later, hehe
$20 aud on steam amnesia is
im so behind on stuff
next pay day its mine
Sylandest: mhm :I
FlareChaser: morning, Flare! How are you today?
I don't find amnesia scary at all, so that probably says something about me
But hell
Any luck Ninjazz?
L4D isn't scary at all anyway
Sylandest: I am doing just great! how about you? :)
oh yeah lol i got 2 girls to feel my muscles the other day and im stronger than her x
Vordox: Ninjazz is not here...:S
ex*
l4d isn't scary because its more about shooting the shit out of everything
Errr...The wuut Sylandest
FlareChaser: I'm doing good, if a little sleepy, lol. I only just woke up
00,02hmmm
00,02Ninjaz is taking his time

Everypony, Go over to BronyTV for a live showing of the new episode of Korra at 11 am EST.
00,02simonli2575 says hi
Never used Melee weapons on expert
Airpuff: I don't own this game, so I would be the literal news who dies all the time, lol
*newb
Very_Silly_Filly how come
Always gone for the ranged because it's safer
I'll bbl everypony. Bye for now.
Sylandest: >.<
alexxm: On expert, zombies hit for 20 from the front
bye Obsidian
laters, Obsidian
I think using a melee weapon is a bit suicidal
Very_Silly_Filly ah right never played on expert mode before
It's hard
I can only just manage it
hey there
hello.
Tanks can 3 hit kill you from max hp
howdy, Cyrus_123
That explains a lot
Going to watch Korra?
*yawn* i just woke up and i went to bed at like 2 am

Where'd Phase4 go?
Best part about it: He's a brony.
someone start talking about linux, that might bring him back
what is that moving on the floor?
an axe?
/me starts conversation about linux
i like the part about linux where the things and stuff happens
What is going on in this game?
...its not working
openSUSE is best pony
ikr
So, as far as I know, Linux can use applications made for Windows, right? :P
i dont know
Not all applications
im intrested in it but the idea of a lack of compatibility is annoying
Not all of them
But you can install a virtual windows on it
/me yawns.....need more coffee
That's what I did back when I had a crappy mac
or run 2 partitions
Vordox: Just go without him, He'll follow
I'm not playing :P

08,01indeed
Very_Silly_Filly did you know him before bronystate
No
I think the box I got contains my Redwall kit :) or a very large pony toy
sounds good Lil_B
I've known him on Bronystate a long time though
alright then
Knew him before he became a techie, never mind a mod :)
As soon as I put that thing together, I can get some proper measurement for the Redwall project in minecraft
everyone: hover with your mouse on the "Bronystate Mane Chat" above the Chatbox and ready the text
Everything is bees

alexxm: the area I'm building the abbey is a huge forested area, on an island - hope its big enough, there are some extremely tall trees on the eastern edge that could be Brockhall, several cave systems under the island, and the northern part is snowy - last I played I was looking for a large sandy area for Salamandastron

11,01I just do.
http://i.imgur.com/ZQEkK.jpg
Kandarihu: Yes, Big Science. The notion that academia is a giant machone for extracting grant money that engages in conspiracies to fake findings.
Who said scietnists get mad money for being scietnists?
I'm just saying that this whole shoving the manmade climate change theory down all of our throats is nothing more than a plot to give absolute power over everyone's lives to the government.
He's ND he does what he wants.
11,01FillyFlam: Exactly.
Kandahiru: No, see, what you just wrote IS a conspiracy theory.
SCREW THE RULES, HE'S ND
Science doesn't benefit from this. It's throwing the scientific process out the window just to throw everyone's freedoms out the window.
|Discord|: i hate coffee too, and thats why i have to add milk and crap for it to be bearable
Just that huh.
Space Invaders tattoo rocks
Agenda 21 isn't a theory.

Nittany_Discord: that is the only way to drink coffee
Has everyone here read the alternative "Previous "elements of Harmony? =3 IT WAS AWESOME COMIC SERIES
will there be aquabats today?
I'm glad I muted Kandarihu weeks ago
Ahh the library.. if it was nearer I might have walked to it today.. but can';t do any proper walking :/
wht is this?/
Kandahiru: It, like the UN, has absolutely no power at all. None
You know the song that I put on goes surprisingly well with this PMV.
10Mm? Why not?
I love the library :3
how come Tovler
Kandahiru?
I just had my wisdom teeths out ^v^;
DocSane: Go say no to your authority, see how long you last?
holy fuck! goal for denmark!
and if my blood starts pumping it could cause me to bleed
Vordox: The UN has authority over me?
what is this?!
I tore open a large package yesterday and that was enough to make me bleed!!
derpy_pony WHAT?? :O
DocSane: You're part of a country taht endoorses in it, right?
alexxm: I'm not very good with his type of people
Bah grammar
backflash

alright Tovler
10Ah. I'm getting my wisdom teeth out quite early, next month actually
skype noises
Vordox: We endorse it only so long as it does what we want.
netherlands - denmark 0:1
Are they really bothering you?
Mods, could you please put a ban without a kick until Tovler agrees to unmute me? If one person can't respect my right to talk about important things, I don't want that sort of inconsistancy between who can hear me and who cannot.
all time favorite :)
:$ THIS SONG
2Augh wisdom teeth, I've been lucky with them so far
Er, a ban on me
Vordox: The US won't even sign on to the International Criminal Court.

10Somewhat, yes. On and off pain. My bottom ones are all the way up and my mother says it's easy and cheaper to get them all removed in one go, so.
sorry caps
drbrony: HECK YEAH
Vordox: Please name one instance where the UN has been able to affect anything without US troops to back it up?
Why are you guys even discussing this? Do you really think you're going to change the other persons mind? Come on.
I must know the name of this song. Now.
Litwick: This is Florence + The Machine, I think that's what they're called.
DocSane: Isn't that a bit...
Litwick: Cosmic Love by Florence and the Machine
ok im off for a while...i must that see...Denmark leads versus Netherlands...unbelievable
Litwick: Cosmic Love.
FillyFlam thats the band
anyone else laggign?
the stars will her in her escape?
nope drbrony
Vordox: I'm saying the notion that the UN is some sort of all-powerful boogeyman is belied by even a casual glance at reality.
Thats very true, despite that I only had the two bottom ones removed XD it's free for us though
thats it im breaking the fourth wall!
I hate my mother sometimes
lol
Twilight <3
i hate my mother all the time
The stars will aid in her escape is the name of this pmv
DocSane: I'm more suprised that you validate UN's only reason of changing things are through military means...Quite hypocritical to me, even as a base.
i love my mother all the time
i mean my dad
my mom is awesome
my dad is a dick
12~
13:3
I was supposed to be going to my dads on THURSDAY, and not only did she delay it, she's cancelled the whole fucking trip altogether
The UN isn't competent enough to pull of some elaborate conspiracy. They don't have to. They have bombs.
I know this is probably TMI but for me, I had a bit of pain but the main problem was food always got caught in one as it was coming in sideways, it was extremely hard to dig it out.. and if I couldn't get to a bathroom soon enough, it would cause abscesses >v>
I'd appreciate if the documentary UN Me were streamed on here.
NO DOCUMENTARYS PLEASE
12LOL
MrMaxaminus: The UN has bombs?
2AE :3
13Best thing ever ;3
13ohai all :D
Anyway to get that one taken out they had to drill it, the one on the other side just got pulled out XD
yes a lot
can you imagine watching a documentary? BORING!
MrMaxaminus: Are you confusing the UN with NATO, because the UN has no military forces.
whats this song?
but I didn't feel a thing and I was sedated, I found it quite interesting infact
omg buffers!
Lil_B: Cosmic Love
I heard them crack my tooth XD it was weird
Yeah you're right. I was being hyperbolic.
there were the Jews, the media, the illuminati, the Bush registration, now the freaking UN is too part of a conspiracy? Come on...
Epic Hug Time
my great uncle was the commander of the pakistani army but he was poisoned and i cried for a long time

Pardon me?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Protection_Force --- the UN would like to disagree with your statement that there are no UN military forces :)

hi sagas!!!!!!
hey sagas hows your day been
hello sagas
Did anyone else get an email from Nintendo about Animal Crossing?
no
Clearly Princess Celestia was behind Discord's breakout.
Nope
Cyrus_123: beggars can't be choosers
Tovler: nope
Tovler: IF this is bad news, I'm gonna be PISSED
I know it's unpleasant to hear about this. But you know what? There were plenty of stuff that were streamed earlier this week that was VERY uncomfortable, and I'm not allowed to even complain about it.
and thats why i work hard to not be a beggar
alexxm: pretty good so far. Got up and went to the dealership to take a car for a test drive. How bout u?
bad news is never good
11,01Animal Crossbreeding?
She was conspiring with the Zebra King to break up Twilight's wedding.
I'm not in the best of moods, better be good

Whos the next streamer?
i dont even care what we watch now
neewwwboornn cuuttiees

Tovler: What's this thing about Animal Crossing?
Tata Phase4
I'd say it's time to watch the sea ponies sing
In 3DS version if Animal Crossing, you can finally wear skirts as a male. Man, I'm still devastated.

BYE Phase4!
Bye Phase4

06Mine seem to be like, sloooowly deciding if they can be bothered to appear or not :?
brbs
alexxm: alright. The car had a few problems. The previouse owners never changed the belt after 100k miles, so that would have to be done. Other than that it went well
All I really wanted was for some Magicka to be streamed before the sale expires.
06how LAZY. and hi, and ok

oh magic conch shell what should we do?
10No pics yet
fffffffffffff

Get a new one
Nintendo makes movie things to tie in with the games that tie in with the movie that tie in with the games that tieeeeeeeeanofasfd'gersjgwej509b238-0r zwue-05tb ;9wzeut;8HAF*CK

lol
argh :/
?
I just hate that Pokemon, sorry
MLP hater
>:I
/me hide
nah
10I can't get too excited over most Unova legendaries
I don't enjoy Kledeo much either; Its design looks too weird
2None of the Musketeers have grown on me
10Reshiram, Zekrom, Kyurem are alright. Virizion and Cobalion sorta
I honestly only like Cobalion; Verizion maybe but it looks too silly
/me steals the magic conch
/me eats Biglaw
10You spelled Virizion wrong, stop thinking of the cell phone company :P
Hi all!~ o/
:p
hi Unnr!!!!!
THE SHELL HAS SPOKEN
/me sits down
anypony else wanna hear user0 play?
10Of all Unova legendaries though, Meloetta I dislike the most
hello all.
and stuff.
/me pokes Midnight_Tempest . Been a while, eh?
10I mean, what is that thing even supposed to be?
hello WallDives
I actually do dislike MLP as well, that is one of the reasons that Pokemon annoys me
but I can;'t stand the trio either
Dragonborn, Dragonborn,By his honor, is sworn, To keep evil forever at bay, And the fiercest foes rout,When they hear triumph's shout,Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray,And the Scrolls have foretold,Of black wings in the cold,That when brothers wage war come unfurled,Alduin bane of kings,Ancient shadow unbound,With a hunger to swallow the world.
no stream?

Poor netherlands. No pony loves them. T_T

Unnr, oi.
/me hopes that Euro has a better ending than champions
Unnr, true story.
I don't wanna be like the Netherlands!
10Tornadus because of bird sacred beast forme?
I wanna be like Germany!
Ambitious and Misunderstood!
Welcome to Bakersville!
I like the netherlands...
2The Djinns grew on me a fair bit before that, but that was a pleasant surprise
Oh god and that OTHEr trio, I'd forgotten them >v>
Unnr I'm Dutch...
then again, born there, so meh, whatever.
what is this bird beast form you speak of?
10http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/6/64/641Tornadus-Reijuu.png
mexico FTW
Bakersville Conneticut?
That place sucks
Wait, more Dutch bronies here? O:
10Genie trio got their own alternative formes, known as "sacred beasts"
Why do we even have that state?
I was looking forward to a Bayern Munich / Barce game for the finals
10Too similar to legendary beasts in GSC, eh
not MLP rerun?
2Formes formes everywhere
WHAT THE HELL
00,10I blame the death pyramid for my sleeping in.
let me check
10Landorus' sacred beast forme especially, it stands up like Raikou, Entei, and Suicune would
2That one sort of makes sense though, since he's a Ground type

:<
Desktop Derpy :)
I've been here for ages, and not seen you once, so that's why I asked
alexxm, lesson learned, these are horrible *nomnomnom*
Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowwolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West!
i notice that i no longer can keep up, eek!
12Sorry what are the pranksters?
TheHouseholdWarrior: You have my bow
wall.
6the genies
1,11Meanwhile: And I'm Harry Mcbuttes. In today's news, we have a textwall right above me.
Sumi: Facts may be nice, but don't have to be that blunt?
Alright, I'm here for the film
6I''ve forgotten their trio name, but I hate the term genies

PONY YES!
So much text walls
Lil_B: they are not as bad as these
Lil_B: Just checking ^^
Dawwwh :O
12ok so I'm guessing the story is that the weird genie type forms are reincarnations of their sacred forms? ov0
Movie?!!!
Derpeh doesn't sleep well :P
SO IT BEGINS
YAY :)
2I feel like the only person who liked the genie forms lol
Derpy is best sleeper

StinkomanFan: D:

Derpy knows how to sleep upside down

BRONIES BEFORE HONIES
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Luc Besson got the idea of doing this movie while working on his previous movie, La Femme Nikita. In that film's third act, Victor the Cleaner (Jean Reno) appears to deal with the aftermath of Nikita's botched mission. Realizing the potential of the character was underused in that movie, Besson decided to create a story that focused on the activities of such a
1,11character. Both Victor and Leon appear dressed in a long wool coat, sunglasses and a knit cap. The film's working title was "The Cleaner".

Leon is best pony
My mom is seeing this part for the first time, and she's not too happy to see a child smoking.
how old is she again?
13restarted browser since then?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Natalie Portman's parents were extremely worried about the smoking scenes in the film, and before they allowed Natalie agree to appear, they worked out a contract with Luc Besson which had strict mandates as regards the depiction of smoking; there could only be five smoking scenes in the film, Portman would never be seen to inhale or exhale smoke, and Mathilda
1,11would give up during the course of the film. If one watches the film closely, one can see that all of these mandates were rigidly adhered to; there are precisely five smoking scenes, Portman is never seen inhaling or drawing on a cigarette, nor is she ever seen exhaling smoke, and Mathilda does indeed give up during the course of the film.
RATS.

"You smell nice"
TOLD YOU HE'S BATMAN
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the scene when Stansfield (Gary Oldman) 'interrogates' Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco), Oldman smells the father, and gets extremely physically close to him. According to Badalucco, he had no idea that Oldman was going to smell him, nor that he was going to get as close as he did. Badalucco says that in the film, his look of discomfort during the scene
1,11is completely genuine, as he felt decidedly intimidated by Oldman, and the physical proximity between the two made him very nervous.

why did he leave his gun's there
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The pistols that Léon use in the film are Beretta 92FS's with AL-GI-MEC compensators added on. In some scenes, he affixes them with sound suppressor, with threads that extend past the compensator cuts to cancel out the escaping gases that could potentially escape and produce a loud gunshot. In the final firefight, one of Léon's Berettas is seen with a stainless

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to Patrice Ledoux, Luc Besson planned Léon as filler. At the time, he had already started working on The Fifth Element, but production was delayed due to Bruce Willis's schedule. Rather than dismiss the production team and lose his creative momentum, Besson wrote Léon. It took him only 30 days to write the script, and the shoot lasted only 90 days.
1,11Ironically, Léon is now generally considered to be a far superior film to The Fifth Element.

Besides, I was being silly
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to Jean Reno, he decided to play Léon as if he were a little mentally slow and emotionally repressed. He felt that this would make audiences relax and realize that he wasn't someone who would take advantage of a vulnerable young girl. Reno claims that for Léon, the possibility of a physical relationship with Mathilda is not even conceivable, and as
1,11such, during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Mathilda to be emotionally in control of the conversations.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to actress Maïwenn, part of the film is based on her romantic relationship with director Luc Besson. Le Besco (who plays the blond prostitute in the opening scene) was engaged to writer/director at the time the film was made. Le Besco had met Besson when she was 11, and had fallen in love with him when she was 15 (Besson was 32 at the time).

hi TheStrategyGuy
WHAT WHAT WHAT! :O
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When the film was first tested in LA, the version that was screened incuded a short scene where Mathilda asks Léon to be her lover. However, the audience became extremely uncomfortable and began to laugh nervously, completely destroying the tone of the film. The film received terrible test scores at the screening, and as such, producer Patrice Ledoux and
1,11writer/director Luc Besson decided to cut the scene for theatrical release.
seriously wtf
OH GOD NO
*good time to pause*
Nittany_Discord: yes it is.
