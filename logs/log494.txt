I wanred you that you would escape
I never doubted you

G1 apple jack is a dork :p
08,01Kandarihu: eating hay?
00,10Thanks, night all
Such a silly pony!
Saturn: 0_0
08,01it was warm
00,02Saturn, you dont have to say it that way
I used to ride horses all the time >_>
08,01what?
08,01you guys just assume everything i say is innuendo...
00,10I horsed a stroke
08,01well, most of the time it is
ugh. Why can't I sleep normal?
but then one day I spawned an irational fear of them and cant get close to horses anymore :<
/me 00,02hugs Saturn
6AM
08,01flutter_spin: drink a load of caffeine
00,02Vordox, you online?
feck sleep :P
I don't like coffee
00,02lol
welp its 7:15am nite ya'll see yas later
Coffee doesn't agree with me
I couldn't sleep. It was like 2:30AM before I could sleep
00,10oh I know, i can leave stream running
Rain: Even if it has enough memeory, it might not support SSE2 or 3 or whatever
I have crap sleep patterns.
And I have to go out at 8AM
I blame time zone travel.
me
tooo
I blame the world for being round. :P
00,10enjoy
Rain: it seems to have a problem with my computer as well.
ugh
it burns
00,02XD
08,01Vordox: every processor since 2000 (pentium 4 era) has supported SSE2.
Suddenly the hub
08,01wait
Saturn: Ikr
08,01i mean whoever said that
08,01Very_Silly_Filly:
08,01oh, damn
08,01i fail at irc
00,02Sumica, i was about to take over but this is more fun XD
Saturn: Mine doesn't, and it's 2011
O.o
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: yes it does
WHOA
CLOSE
whoa
00,10was making sure capture card was working for later
00,02ah, k
I know it doesn't run games from 2000
Rain: Yeah but Huuuub!
after an anvil
and a cart
00,02stream is up
00,02i was earlier
Streamception
Again
08,01oh, the graphics card is nothing to do with SSE
Ooooh!
L4D2!
OMW!
Ahh, okay
L4D2
08,01SSE is on the processor
Alright. I need to give this laptop some cooldown time. I'll probably be back in a couple of hours.
L4D2?
I thought all the SSE crap was ossociated with graphics cards because the system requires always put it in the GFX
terraria? TERRARIA!
GP4
I hear L4D2 Trailer
That sound in the BG XD
I can't run it because I only have a 64 MB GFX
00,02Kandarihu, ikr :(
It can't run Terraria, it can't run Fall0out
You know it's on discount, right?
I need a Express graphics for it
A shitty GMA x4500
It's Integrated of course, as it's a laptop
But I have an Express slot in my Laptop
08,01a GMA x4500 should be able to run games from recent eras...
00,02thats more gore than i usualy tollerate
08,01i think maybe you have somethign set up wrong
I still say, in comparrison to TF2, TF2 is more gore.
Most games from like 5-8 years ago need about 128 to 256 Mb
00,02oh cool, borderless window mode
00,02i know it didnt, nothing much i could do though
LOL... I only have a GeForce FX 5200. My computer sucks.
Yeah there's an option for that somewhere
00,02ok...
00,02i've never played l4d
In low, I don't think there's gibs unless pipe bomb
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: anything DX9 or under should work with that card
and its cheap
00,02kerbal finished downloading ^_^
08,01and it's apparently DX10 compatible
08,01but very, very slow
Saturn: Chances are, my setup is ballsed up, because my tower can't run TF2
and apparent, I've quadruple the minimum requirements
00,02wheres the gore option?
00,02there it is
options -> multiplayer -> gore
00,02gore: low
00,02:)
Right, here's my laptops specs
00,02stream working?
YEP
Yes
Got visuals and all
ya huh
00,02Vordox, you host?
give him time
Hosting Terraria atm, just let me check
Also, there's dedicated servers
00,02i think the x4500 was one of the first good ones
I'll join if I may? :)
00,02k
00,02this cant be that hard
Err Depends on difficulty
THer'es 4 I think
Set it to easy if you want pussy difficulty
My tower NEEDS more RAM
Campign is recommended
easy is like pasifism mode
1GB can't play shit nowadays
Der.
Derp*
Play with Friends
00,024 slots avaliable
:o
3 slots, with you :P
I really need to get L4D2....
:'(
More people interested? =3
I have L4D2, but my tower can't run it
00,02anyone else got l4d2?
I'll join you guys :3
00,02i'll invite ^_^
I have it.
Yes.
Time for my noms, be right back.:D
One more spot.
00,02should i spam invites :P
XD
They can join you and you can invite them
Yes.
I has it.
00,02someone just added me
00,02slots filled ^_^
Hold on, is that 1Gb of ram or 4?
:P
hai
My graphics is brilliant, yeah
Spent 200 quid on it:3
If I get the money, I'll probably build a laptop
kool :$
Try and fit 8-16 GB in, with mabye ani5 processor
00,02?
(Ala TF2)
00,02ah
Offical is Valve server
00,02HiImSpike, there are differences, i7 is quad and has the virt extentions
00,02Mostly the same though
00,02and i5 is most likley a slightly faulty i7
Well, processor speed is fine for agaming atm
but for most users those advantages are negligable
a snail coul'd move faster than my loading bar -.-
:p'd
hey, i only needed 1 hour for the work :D
I wish I had L4D2 uncensored...
Fucking germany
Could only buy censored version
00,02k
kiddy land
its because they dont have a proper "adult" rating in certain countries
as such they need to censor to sell at all
brb
EVGA
cards burn out in 2-4 years anyway warrentee or no
Next to no gore
blood is removed, persistant bodies
I fucking hate it
I am an adult, and this government treats me like an idiot
that's why I never buy games.
censorship
hah "standard gaming time"
I live in america
I guess one reason I hate britain is because half of my owned guns are illegal to own :/
Or take out to public rather
theyll run the card at maybe 70% tops
I have 13
15 days*
:O why?
asdasdasdasdasda
i thought americas headache was swearing
I like to collect
Most of them are quite old
crap
fair enough i guess
I have a 1940's luger
From WWII
cool
l4d2 is both old and well written
you really shouldnt have any issues with performance
/me sobs in a corner.'
Hehe
If gore was on, thered be headless zombies everywhere
EV'RYDAY I'M SHUFFLING!!!!
/me shuffles.
which are?
they wont ever do that
watercooling is definately not portable
nice
They'll make one ventually
No!
BRB Everypony going to relocate!!!
and how hot laptops are :D
they can't
haahha==a
^
$$$
120 gb SSD is cheap already. But anything above is expensive as fuck
give it a year or 2
Amnesia is terrifying
Zombies are people too 3:
i did enjoy 2070
I can't run shit on this humble on ratthlebox
or just upgrade it
kool
My Tower is very quiet
Damn consoles are keeping me back
I've given up with consoles
main advice, dont be cheap on the case
Xbox 360 runs L4D at a shit framrate
Only runs it at 45 FPS
nice nice
not really
mine WAS good....when i got it :D
00,02k
Mine was good when I got it
mornin
Lol, you lot are terrible
boom baby
lol :D
00,02but its soo hard :'(
00,02gore is still higher than i'd like
Success!
00,02XD
325 wattage is definitly not enough
High has you blowing zombies in half
at lease 500 watts
I think that is the reason that one time my graphics went down horribly. Just not enough wattage
yeah
Keeps emergency overheating power off
ive got 700
Be careful though
future proof
Does anyone know any good grahics cards for an express slot?
:)
higher watt power supplies look cooler too
most important part
or corsair is also good
little expensive but good
Or you could just get a Falcon
All you need is around 2000 quid :)
Gonna buy me a main SSD soon. 120gb for 100 bucks
Buy an external hard drive, they are cheap
ive got a 320 gig ssd
And just open it up and take out the hard drive
but thats just silly! :)
I bought a 500 Gb XHD for 50 quid
Camera with internal SSd recorder -> http://www.blackmagic-design.com/products/blackmagiccinemacamera/design/
dont need partitions, i have 3x1TB drives in my machine
I had a 69 gig hard drive in my old laptop
3 t that huge man
damn, now THATS a camera
Having a Tape drive would also be neat, I have a Ton of Music, and a friend of mine recently lost 50% of his music because 2 of his older hard-drives died
My dads has around 1.5 Tb
My father told me he once paid 500 bucks for 5mb drive...
ive got 1.5 terabyte too
just replace harddrives every other year, they are cheap enough and data is priceless
all i know is my computer is a piece of crap
and a 1terabyte external
exactly
haa bit old
I think this was in the 90's
I would say
Man, I wish I could go back in time with a Playstation 3 and show them early gamers our games...
No thanks.
you would be rich
thing is when you get to these sorts of capacities, you usually use it all

My first computer was a laptop from 1999
mine is a 1995
12 gig
00,02?

Nab one
and 512 graphics
Carebears is coming on soon lol
I still have my SNES in top top condition
No yellowing on it as of far
My oldest console is my Vectrex
Why did you let her?
Sega is mine
I still have my N64 my first own console :'(
The vectrex is from 1982
I still remember playing the Atari 2600
And I'm only 20
haaa
I'm not that old
atari serous
I have a few collections
all i had was nes
I have 3 collections of 3 different things
As well as clear memories of playing Impossible Mission on the Commodore 64
actually, Arcade is my first console...
00,02:P
00,02it was over by the time you said that
Never do that on Expert
hahahahaa
Also nab the spas 12
It's an autoshotgun
Every weekend I woke up at 06:00 to play Legend Of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Supermario 64 or Banjo Kazooie
It's an autoshotgun
zelda is s0oooooooooooo good
I was afraid you had said Superman 64 for a moment there
I actually loved it
Majoras Mask is best Zelda
My favourite zelda is OoT 3D, then probably Skyward sword
swag**
Skyward sword was really good
No exploration WHATSOEVER!
mine was ocarina of time on the 64
I played links awakening
that was ok
08,01Lambo: well, we can
didnt like the swimming and riding
08,01really easily, actually
08,01but they'd be hella slow
Time: 8 am EST/7 am CST/5 am PST. Guess what's showing on The Hub now.
Saturn: Show me one decent one
Care Bears?
home improvement
?
You need around 8-16 Gb of ram to run a PS3 emu
08,01as always, i made no claims to decency
you got the sd card
Course I have the SD card, I need it to play
08,01Lambo: simply emulating the architecture isn't a problem. it's emulating it at a usable speed that's the problem. and yes, in 10 years, we might have hardware fast enough for it.
oh that reminds me i left my ps3 on
sorry ive got something called R4 which lets me play all games
08,01either that, or do some kind of JIT translation on the fly
The 3DS can't play 3DS games that are hacked
08,01but that's be... kinda crazy
I even got threw the Color dungeon in Links awakening DX in on my old gameboay XD
I still have my old gameboy with tetris.
then...buy a ps3?
I even still have my old savestate, with 497 deaths
You can hack it to use the R4, but you can only play DS games on it
But it's a Gameboy Pocket
08,01Lambo: then you either need a lot of money, or a time machine
08,01the latter kinda implies the former, though
make a money machine
And get arrested?
08,01i've always wanted to try my hand at forging money
Which part of Australia though, eastern or western states?
ok make an invisible money machine
08,01it's really interesting, the kind of security devices they use on notes and coins
Eastern. West is at 10 pm.
Forging GBP is pretty difficult
08,01i think forging coins would be easier
aud is pretty hard to forge
Which is for me a good thing, living in Perth
Forging US bills is quite easy
Euro bills is much harder
nah printing is visible but the machine isnt
But there's only 1 layer of paper
french and american money seems not that hard
They banned £50 notes because they were too often forged
This was before they put foil in them
It's June 9th. June 9th is 6-9. 6-9 equals 6_9.

The UN isn't competent enough to pull of some elaborate conspiracy. They don't have to. They have bombs.
I know this is probably TMI but for me, I had a bit of pain but the main problem was food always got caught in one as it was coming in sideways, it was extremely hard to dig it out.. and if I couldn't get to a bathroom soon enough, it would cause abscesses >v>
I'd appreciate if the documentary UN Me were streamed on here.
