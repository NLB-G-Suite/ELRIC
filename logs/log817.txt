So let's see... the other ponies whom we've not seen their parents are... Rainbow Dash... and Fluttershy?

What about Scoots family?
HAHA
There's a MLP: FiM movie?
They are dead. They are pushing up the daisies. They have passed this mortal coil, and joined the choir invisible. They would'nt move if you put ten thousand volts though them-- and tat would offend Applejack anyhow. THEY ARE EX-PARANTS.
We don't?
thats so worng

DUDE I LIFT
lol
LOL
Q: Where are Applejack's parents?To put it bluntly, we just never figured it out. I just liked the feeling of them living with their Granny, but keeping the family dynamic tight and small. To be honest, I would like to simply say that they passed away somehow, but it's just it would have likely been deemed too sad for a kids' show and I don't think it would have ever been approved. There was brief discussion of them being traveling salesponies
who is your fav villain?
Hey, try command+F
Do you EVEN lift?

Record_Discord: it's older

otakon: Whatever
Record_Discord: erh sorry I meant to say it's short
The movie's not all that close to the book though.
looks awesome + 100% yahtzee approved.
i heard it was quick thinker
I wonder if THQ has any good deals on any of their Spongebob games...
otakon: Yes, BUT it has replayabiltiy
Record_Discord: believe me, one playthrough is enough if you are thorough
LordDerpington: thats because its an 80s book adaption movie

So, what are we watching??
Arnold hauls beams by hand because he's badass.
Record_Discord: not saying it's a bad game, but it's kind of a one trick pony is all, also reminded me a LOT of Bioshock
running man
THE RUNNING MAn.

05,15Is that better everyone?
otakon: I loved bioshock, I'll be willing to try that
much better

Is Arnold wearing a beard here?
05,15Richard Bachman AKA Stephen King
ApplejackSwag: dude
Quick_Thinker: ya
It's based on a book!
Richard Bachman = Stephen King, by the way.
ApplejackSwag: No rule 34 on chat
yes Ganjalf
k
he will shave
Ultra high security prison. Where one prisoner revolt, and one password gains you your freedom.
he's going for the Norris look
it does sound like Shin ra
CITY.
ApplejackSwag: have you read the rules, bc that is a bannable offense there man
Las Pegasus.
i've played Fallout 3 DLC the pitt and you are a slave in that or you can be a slave in a quest
It's based on actual events>_>
Quick_Thinker: they never put a collar on you
totally ganjalf
Oh yeah. The Pitt was kinda similar.
so i take it once they get far enough away the signa breaks or something
LordDerpington: The BradPitt?
MY LITTLE PONY
The title drop?
oh wait
so the collars dont go bomb
Sundaysmile: Cool, don't remember any other movie where he had a beard
The title drop!
Game show about fight to the death. Hunger Games.
dat music
Didn't he have one in Commando?
RosePetal: With a title drop in there!
Title drop.
LordDerpington: I'm pretty sure Fallotu got the idea for the exploding collars from The Running Man
The Running Man was written by Phillip K Dick, not Stephen King
ApplejackSwag hey! not fair some people got banned for such links
which came first?: Running man or Smash TV
Starlight_Phoenix: Running Man
ouo: I now right?
jdunk1971: No, it was Richard Bachman, which was Stephen King's pseudonym for writing scifi.
QUICK THROW THE COLLER!
Would you kindly
LordDerpington: and fantasy
darn ads
You can never get rid of a bomb when you need to
otakon: Would you kindly drop the title?
get adblock
Record_Discord: what title?
No "fire in the hole"?
Butcha.
otakon: The title drop
The Running Man
But Arnold played in other movie that was based on Philip K. Dick's novel, which was...?
BURN
otakon: Yeah, that title
Total Recall
dat pun
We're obviously watching Harry Potter otakon
Smoking like a boss.
SirGanjalf: We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, which became Total Recall.
Good answer jdunk1971, have a muffin:P
The new total recall has nothing on Arnies one
qoors
So...
Chinese Lanterns.
no were watching star wars the unexpected chamber of dawn
Blueberry or cranberry?
so...
We should have the Arnie Total Recall on Bronystate some time. Would you say it's a "B" movie?
blueberry
and extra muffin for mentioning novel title goes to LordDerpington
those collars in Fallout even look like these things
just a bit smaller
/me eats muffin.
its a good movie done in the style of a B movie
Tall Building.
Quick_Thinker: fallout only had that in F:NV with the Brotherhood quest
jdunk1971: ...blueberry?
/me regurgitates a muffin
80's limo
/me eats popcorn "anypony want some"?
So...
Nice retro limo.

smrtgy1: dude you can't have a 3 without the first two, which are PC only isometric turn based RPG's

Lil_B: Apparently Arnold once offered to do the voice for his character in the German dub of Terminator, but they turned him down because he has an Austrian accent, which to German ears makes him sound like a yokel.
Quick_Thinker: you mean racist barn?
Dumbass

Oooh, just in time for the pony episode!
@CriticKitten perhaps that's the point? That no matter how much you struggle, in the end you won't be able to change human nature and every victory is ultimatively pointless?
i just wonder if Army of darkness will be here
Top Gun was 80s and I took it more seriously.
wait..
Actually, I was hoping for the intermission and the lottery...
a fun movie, entertainy if a little meh.
Yay dishonored is almost done :D

i told the other stranger off xD
RainRunner hot
CriticKitten: well, implied. But damn, can't win against Kitten overruling. ^^
now for no need for batteries...
pony_300: in fact people all probably knew it was a lie but everyone was too afraid/ brainwashed to fight
we need Bladerunner sometime
get some steel panther out there.
What was Scoot streaming? I was sleeping, I just woke up recently
which time was that
ok can we watch another movie? :D
that riles you up
Black Swan would have been different with 80s music
ouo: Very :P
Suzano: We will in about 40 minutes
the one about the size and age and that..
super
I like how they ordered Ventura's character to fight Arnie with the silly costume so he refused, then they digitally made a mano-amano fight without the silly costume that Ventura's character wanted in the first place. :)
the final countdown too :3
thats what I thought

Although Dash's dickishness passed on over to Lightning Dust.
To be fair, every writer at the show has at the very least one character they just can't characterise correctly.
just like in Real Life
I'm all of those things
nope.
dash was never mean as much as just egoistic
back!
It's funny how you guys are talking like you invented the characters.
today i was at the mall
Dash is egocenric, not mean

Shizuka: What do you mean by "more encores"? I just checked the backlog and we haven't had Wall*E on here

Ponies that are are bored and not a sight of entertainment to be found

Meh.
Wall E was shown ages ago I remember it
I call for a re roll that involves mst3k

you gotta sign up for the newsletter snow
maybe they're not aware that's there's really no need for this teary despair
13but we never got that added to the list for some reason
So far I won only a screening of Applebuck Season, but Dead Alive/Braindead made it too so it's a moral victory :D
Before anyone bans me; keep in mind I suggested a Batman movie the last time I won the lottery
(-_-U)
Shizuka: right after Lesson Zero

Besides, there have been people who have won more than once
05but for how beautiful it is

Nostalgia critic is terrible
Hehe, I found Nittany's link to BronyState's rules :$ http://fav.me/d5dzyf5

i want to sign up for the newspaper
I mainly pick random films for my A though, it's my B that I want to see in here one day
What's up?
gonna take a nap, bye all
we should do voting as it's the most fair I feel.
whats wrong with the lottery this week?
Hahaha, thats it :D
the b movie..
That was too great.
05Snow: klick the link on the front page
fluttercry: So for the next four weeks do I just put N/A for my A vote?

Saucy ponies D:
But the B movie was my childhood.....
^
WAIT
Buytoast: nope. and honestly i don't care if you don't :)

05,15J_E_Smith71 that or say "inelligable"

follow that bird
sesame street movie
otakon: Follow That Bird is A-movie material.
Hazard: Follow That Bird
and that's the truth
NO, DON'T REROLL IT, IT'S A GOOD MOVIE
i dont see a prob with it
Oh good god.
The More You Know
Follow the Birds!
otakon: Tell that to everyone else.

No wonder it was voted as the B Movie.
Guys the b movie isnt bad A TOLL

to see if i saw it before
Hazard: Wall E

Follow That Bird: 6.3 on IMdB with 3 stars Wrek
yep

kewl
05relaxors
Meh
obese ppl have such interesting lives
3 stars? Seems legit.
I mean Pixar films are all As right?
While i dont approve of such art, i found it funny :D
Why did I even to ask that...
could have been better with the whole humans side but otherwise, grade a material
monsters inc isnt a b movie?
cars 2?
i keep voting that for b movie...
Cars 2 would probably be a B Movie.
Oh yeah...not sure about all of the,
indeed
Evil dead 2? :D
so.. can somepony tell me wich movies won the lottery I came right after the lottery here -.-
Oh! Is anyone else joining in the Winter Art Contest??
Be right back.
Bogy: Wall*E and Follow That Bird
Can I say something quickly?

i hope we get the dark knight rises for A movie one day. only got to see it 40 mins in :(
Suzano:

TV Movie? Remake? No-name actors? Perfect B-movie fodder.
nobody chooses b movies like gaston! XD
/me Sits :3
oh. ok, gonna vote for Follow That Bird next lottery as an A movie.
nobody rerolls like Gaston
dude, Jingle all the way
ehh we once had scott pilgrim vs the world as the A movie when its B, so whatever
Whaaaaat?
Never heard of this movie. Is it good? How cheesy is it?

i used to play in an abandoned ww2 bunker as a kid. most fun place on earth.

You're not far off RosePetal.

the rejected ending to Pixar's Up...
that's not an A
Lacey Plaza.
BroPony|Medic: I belive it's set in the 80's, when the movie actually came out.

05,15Sorry about muting the wrong chat
thelonepony|Halo3: guess i'll go with that then
SuperBrony64: you're wrong, Follow That Bird only grossed 13 million since it was released, ONLY 13 million in 19 years. That is NOT A movie material, although the opening weekend was 2.4 million. It's not an A movie, it's a B movie and should be put back on the llist.
It's ok fluttercry :P
fluttercry: i heard it's great :) saw until the climax, b/c my grandma
also, follow that bird is a b movie fluttercry
:O it's THIS movie!

Combustiblelemons: That's a better way to put it
05,15I don't think it is

The ads are invading again.

TO SPACE
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
$60 the rocket explodes
dem tabs

not enough engines
NEEDS MORE DAKKA
Appropriate music is appropriate
AND BREADLOAF
Where am i? guess, guess, guess!
On BronyState
hopefully the breadloaf will need minimal repairs
That shit
is gonna blow up
Or my name isn't Michael Bay
i've actually weened most of the bugs out of this design
most of them
"NOBODY'S GOING TO SPACE, MATE" -Wheatley
IS GOING TO FLIP
WHY IS IT TILTING?
this design is actually absurdly stable
i've no idea how
TheBucket, roll program
aka gravity turn
Congrats! You're in Space Phase4!
i'm turning it
right now, i argee with Wheatlety.
Uboa-San, nope, still in atmosphere
need music
http://tinyurl.com/bu2x44g I play this game way to much. ._.
Oh.
hi
Say hi to Space Core for me.
plays friday
Ponies47, o.O
gonna go far kid!
Ponies47, may I ask what you actually do to have fun .-.
hey
Modeabel..........
AdamTheDuck, Crash em.
/me dances
Ponies47, ahhhhh, and here I am thinking you played the game the way it was intended XD
It looks like a rugby paddle now.
Using space core as a power core XD
so Ponies47 whats the craziest thing youve done in train simulator?
AdamTheDuck, Buck that (squee)! Why would I wanna do that XD
Phase4, Are you in SPAAACE?
Ponies47, this makes so much sense now XD
now i am in space
anyway, time to play some FEAR
SPAAAAAACE
:D
enjoy Phase's stream everyone :P
:D
AdamTheDuck, I'm amused very easy :>
Wanna se Phase4? buy a telescope
10/10 would hire Ponies47 as a conducter
I'm a great train driver \:3/
isnt the ship beutiful
Michael Bay approves of Ponies47 as a conductor
i am the worst bus driver XD
i like trains
*run over by train*
hi
'sup
Can't sleep
clows will eat me
What we watching?
http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
Phase4: sion: go to where space angry birds live
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #534
your up late :P
bunnyfufu299, we're watching Phase set out to space to find the most curious ways to murder his little friends pilotting that ship
Not really haha
hai everypony :3
I hate it when I am so tired that I am afraid to sleep
so it just makes me even more tired
How does that even work?
This is pretty normal on weekends/days I don't have school
Ohai Spell-of-Gaming
oh I forgot, winter break
well, when you are tired your brain begins to become anxious and paranoid
so yeah
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Glitterface / Applejack's toys / What were you thinking / Muscle Pony Learns...
I'm bored, might as well go to bed haha
night
lol
night then
Did we murder them yet?
ok...
Phase, do you need to account for food supplies in the game?
hi
nope
:D
ohai aniderp|bestcakeever
Ohai aniderp|bestcakeever
It's my baby brother's birthday
maybe i getting pony calendar for chirstmas!
You can always play discord by thelivingtombstone
But no cake yet. .-.
I wanted to make the starve to death and then empty the rocket into space where their bodies will never be found again.
I'm a sick bastard
then it would fit
THROW THEM INTO THE SUN
EXILE THEM ON THE MOON
TO THE MOOOONAHHH!
Btw who do you think are the alicorns in charge of the other planets?
idk
Cadence is like the crystal princess or something
bah, close enough
only missing it by 28000 kilometers
play discord by thelivingtombstone
awesome song
Cadence. Crystal Princess...
or you can play the remix too
She could cameo in Breaking Bad
I think you will find it by looking up discord
freaking awesome song
to the moon?
He's going further I think
bah just throw them into the sun
Can Cadence make crystal meth?
dude
that is wrong
Her being the crystal princess and shit
Just a though, man.
that is so wrong
lol
that feel when heating problems and my pc abruptly shuts down
Drugs in a kids' cartoon
that feel when i was killing everything in sight on black ops2 at the time
so much logic
MURDER THEM
MURDER
MURDER!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait, WHAT IS UP WITH THEIR FACES?
bunnyfufu299, don't worry, i doubt this craft will survive the landing
Stream is a little bit delayed.
play discord by thelivingtombstone
or the remix
or whatever
awesome song
remix is better
ikr
Night everyone
night
Night? It's still 5PM.
Oh right, different time zone.
night
Yup, it's 3:16am where I am
THROW THEM INTO THE SUN GOSH DARNIT
If you like, I can send bunnyfufu299 into the Sun.
guys...
I suddenly have a craving for crunchy garlic snacks right now
._.
wish me luck in gettinf derpy hoodie!
*poker face*
this craft really wasnt designed for interplanetary things
it was intended to be powerfull enough for it
hi
but not to actually do it
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #534
It's a bot.
Oh
brb comitting seppuku
Dari uses RSS feed to check if there are new posts for EQ
why does this video keep playing
play discord?
aw
This is good enough.
lol spaceship
wow, i did a terrible job
At least they die a horrible death.
...
I'm a sick bastard.
hahaha! now they will brun in the sun!
i have an idea
surprise ike intercept
/me Sends himself to the Moon.
who wants to visit duna's moon?
O.O
make a very small orbit and make them go very fast
landing on duna it is
this is gonna be awesome
rainbow factory!
WOO!
Who wants bunnyfufu299 to be in the Moon Paradise?
._.
Prepare to die!!!!
:(:S
>:D
/me Turns on Godmode
Relax there are lots of bunnies on the moon
Are there?
._.
You want to see the rabbits david?

theres very little atmosphere on duna
so this will be rough
get ready!
BUURN, BABY, BURN
DIE! DIE DIE!
/me Delays landing untill 12/31/9999.
zoom in! zoom in!
need to land in a crater
chutes activated
deploy...
come on
well
crap
EET DOZ NUT WURK!
there we go
You cannot land on Duna until: 12/31/9999
LIIIVVVEEEEEE
ffuuu-
had to drop the engines
lol their faces
They
jebs happy
they are like "CRAP DID WE JUST DROP THE ENGINES?"
They're definitely not going back that way again.
bunnyfufu299, well if they didnt drop the engines they wouldnt have slowed enough to not explode
true
How do they get back?
yeah
TheBucket, uh......
They don't, don
't they?
that is how they die
THEY DON'T COME BACK
MUAHAHAH
Damn that's cruel, even by my standards.
i have done return missons from duna
its not so easy
and this was just me screwing around anyway
the really chalenging one though
is eve
YAY!!!!
THEY DID IT!!!
Why is the video, "Twilight found a -----------" so popular on Youtube? (----------- being Lyra Plushie)
We commenced landing.
lol
LOL
and through the magic of video games
i'll end the flight and they teleport home
:3
And now they die of starvation, millions of miles away from home.
o hai @Phase4
ohai KrazyNoobs
With no food and water visible for miles.
now a return misson requires a different capsule
Far away from any family they might have.
That sucks.
I'm going, g'night everyone.
nite
hello everypony
texasboykc09: Hello!
put a lot of engines on that
this wasnt intended for that though, this craft is for building space stations
bunnyfufu299, needs more engine
and make them fly at the sun
Phase4: is that you streaming
this could totaly make the sun
texasboykc09, eyup
bunnyfufu299, suns not that interesting though
Gaben just ate your favorite pony.
you get close then you explode
Wat do?
TheBucket, MOAH HATS
Then why the heck is Celestia hogging the spotlight?
We should go to the actual moon
and try to find luna there
guys... i learned something
my laptop dont like ie anymore
hmmm
aniderp|bestcakeever, wise laptop
i use chrome for all tabs now
aniderp|bestcakeever: why
and its not super hot
If celestia gets pissed, Then she would choke the participants to death.
i used both ie and chrome but chrome has adp now and its fine and didnt shut off yet
i remember building a rocket

Name of spacecraft?
Call it "Tip of the Spear" or something.

Let's hope that rescue mission goes well, eh?
Otherwise, you have two teams to retrieve.
Wobbel :P

That rescue mission's gonna wait awhile, I bet?

Ohai therainbowvortex
NEED A DISPENSER HERE, NEED A DISPENSER HERE, NEED A DISPENSER HERE, NEED A DISPENSER HERE
Meanwhile on Duna...

This looks so wrong.
TIMBER

"Smooth Dubstep - Happy VDAY - OfficialDJPon3 "
MEANWHILE ON DUNA
what the heck did i just build
lets fly it
YEAH!
Doit
What could possibly go wrong?
do t!
Yeah, I jinxed it.
if this works
Phase4: Why is the Stream a little bit Delayed?
how this game called?
even the kerbal guy is happy
Kerbal Space Simulator.
thx
booooom
dat lag
Seems pretty stable.
Uboa-San, just is
one more time!
Hear that?
now with sas!
daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn!
Wait
Phase4: Why I couldnt get on the Stream Question on Omegle? Instead i got some other Questions.
ITS ACTUALLY FLYING?
?
TheBucket, quite succesfsfully
this is impressive
there it goes
dat speech
noooooooooooooooo
booooooom goes the dynamite
Phase4: Spoke to soon :p
For a massive space rocket d*yay*, it's flying pretty good.
its fine
Hear that?
That was the sound of Michael Bay having an orgasm.
we can still make it to space
so basicly a two stage missile that exsplodes on stage 1 :D
im on omegle xD
a.k.a. Michael Bay having an orgasm.
Hello everypony
hi Moopy
hi
space space space
The Kerbil is pretty chill considering he had front row seats to a Michael Bay orgasm.
Well my mom took google chrome off so yeah
Ohai Moopy :)
Moopy: wut
ohai
yeah she did
ALLMOST made it to space
Your mom deleted Chrome?
Well she disconnected it because it makes the youtube videos lag and it makes it slow motion when it sounds like that
if my mom did that, she'd panic and tell me that she's deleted "the internet"
This is the best space program ever concieved.
....and ask me if i could fix it (aka reinstalling the browser) :D
well i had to make my mom do it
Ohai Moopy
Ohai AdamTheDuck
that close to space
imagine.. baby filly pinkie.. in her diaper xD
so close!
THAT KERBIL WILL DEFINITELY SURVIVE REENTRY
i wonder..
And i still can't see the stream on my screen so yeah
you think baby filly dash would wear a diaper or be a rebel?
and not wear one
TheBucket, its not re-entry that kills them
aniderp|bestcakeever, rebel :$
its the sudden stop at the end
oh dear..
probly wear on her head?
theres a thing there
Phase4: It's the searing heat of it, I know.
She'll be so much of a rebel and drink orange juice instead of apple juice :D http://fav.me/d57eoes
i must look at that thing
what about baby filly rarity
diamond diaper?
TheBucket, this game doesnt do re-entry heat
When i came in the chat i still don't see the stream at all cause its like a blocked black screen and all i can see is the Ustream thing when i just came in
That's a boring space sim, then.
but yeah, i found an easter egg
so
we need to go see easter egg
I guess fav.me doens't always work
that works a litle better :P
also D'awwww
daaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
have you tried reloading the stream, Moopy?
HNNNGG
Aeris?
well i did that a couple times and i still can't see the stream at all
Why did you convert Aeris into spaceship parts?
k, 1 and 2 are for engines, 3 is intake
and have you tried to watch it on ustream.tv?
+4 for the lulz
oops
booom
And see if i go and reload the stream its still black on my screen here
That was the sound of Michael Bay having an orgasm.
good luck
hey guys
hey alexxm
Ohai alexxm
car?
I feel considerably newer now.
how are things somepony_else and AdamTheDuck
alexxm, how you been?
I've never been to post-stream BronyState
alexxm, quite relaxing, all the shopping is done :3
cars?
well, hello there then theBucket
I think post stream bronystate is much more civil.
need new playlist
That's alot of tabs
ikr
that'd save a lot of time
i'm good texasboykc09
Phase4, what mission?
i spotted an easter egg
MoonBase Alpha is the best game for the pc's
Phase4, what is it?
no idea
thats why i'm flying there
The ships seems to flap a lot.
Flying or falling with style?
flying
with style
the falling starts later
with no style
So it's a combo. Good to hear :p
so thats why i was banking
I wish they update one where we can hear the pilot screaming and begging for his life.
this thing will reach 1.4KM/s at the higher altitudes
got to get up there first
post-stream BronyState seems like a nice place to be.
I might visit tomorrow/
TheBucket: it is
TheBucket, it usually is
phase, how did you get the fancy chat colors? :D
Arcium, magnets
seems legit
TheBucket, come back another time when you want to kill some time or just chat
k
look at dat speed
TheBucket: sadly, an hour before new episodes streaming we usually got trolls and jerks joining in.
passing 1KM/s
I can tolerate that, anyways.
New MLP episodes numb the brain pain.
TheBucket: Good thing is, they'll left after the new episode ended. And normality restored.
Well, if you can call this chat room "normal" :p
extra intakes are making a world of difference
uh oh
dat warning flameout
And it's all fun and games until someone presses the button to the improbability drive again.
Also, since you're new TheBucket
Phase4: Breath more, fart more.
flameout is incoming :P
TheBucket, welcome welcome welcome, a fine welcome to you! Welcome welcome welcome, I say how do you do? Welcome welcome welcome, I say hip hip hurray! Welcome welcome welcome to BronyState todaaaaaay!~
Hey guys listen umm.......im only going to be on here for 1 hour so yeah
i miss phasepony
^
not sure this plane can make it
texasboykc09, i do too :'(
Jet planes are actually a big hunk of metal having continuous flaming fart right?
Either way, we enjoy it, Phase.
yoah its to slow :P
Phase4, what happen to him?
texasboykc09, ffsplit doesnt capture him for some reason
look at that ground go
This flight reminds me of Ace Combat Electrosphere (or is it Stratosphere?)
I remember when CelestiaRadio had that racist moment, and people in the chat were saying, "It's okay, the episode is about racism anyway." I thought they were joking.
:P
racist barn
racist?
I don't even get it until someone explain it to me.
guess I have to watch the episode
hello KrazyNoobs
yeah, i don't think this plane can make it
DaringDerpy: Forget I said that
The advantage of using English as a second language.
I like how there were numerous references to slavery made duriog the last stream
THAT'S RACIST!
Everyone was all: Get back to work slaves.
Rarity channel never mention that.
oh, and hi texasboykc09
phase : land (/chrash) it with style!
thats a lot of speed
I think it only took place in the TS room.
i'll make it to the other continant
actually i'll run it to fuelout
its burning throuhg it rather fast
Java: I only came to the Rarity channel to spam with gak and florida for 2 minutes. I even got the guy talking on CelestiaRadio to say Snoop Gak.
?
gak is enabled?
>:)
i mean...
that G word is getting old already. Also what with Florida?
>: )
wierd
I know Fark love Florida. But it doesn't have its place here.
one engines producing more thrust than the other
Java to 90% of bronies, it was old after the first day.
yep
an episode about my least favorite pony
phase , thats wierd
The folks that come on over during the new episode, they love gak just as much as I do. Also, they said it was coming back Dec 14, but it was way beyond that already.
Liars
!cd
Episode 9 of season 3 "Spike at Your Service" airs in 6 days, 4 hours, 41 minutes, 16 seconds (Dec 29 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
I think it will be about Spike in Canterlot.
6 days o.o
......
Spike is best pony \:3/
Secret agent spike?
You think swainize will record here during that episode?
wings are having trouble working
Java: If you really want to know, go and read it on EQD
that engine trust
Could it be a James Bond parody?
Cloak and dagger Spike... I can see this happening .-.
KrazyNoobs: I want to be surprised :(
TheBucket, yes
oh damn
Spike is way too underestimated... I actually think he is a good character.
phase how long will you hold on?
KrazyNoobs: The good thing about young characters are that they always learn to understand the complexity of life.
That's why I love Sweetie Belle quote in Babs Seed episode.
java exsactly
Wait hold on a second im going to go reload the stream page hold on a second here
don't go to Sir Dragongobbler's Bulkhead of Horse Based Ascendance
"Why life's so complicated?
that's a terrible place
btw how do you reply?
about half way there
half xD
not sure we're going to make it though
i'm expecint a flameout and craft disintergration
I'm going to take a huge decision soon that will affect my life. I hope I take the right decision.
TheBucket, in chat
phase, i dont think you will be able to do it
Nope its still a blocked black screen so..........sorry
to much engine flameouts n such
At least we get to see an explosion
i did the refresh i did the reload and still nothing
there we go
Why not attaching rocket to the plane when there's flame out?
ye gods this is hard to fly
Java, heavy
oh
also this doesnt go to space
I'm not the one who built it.
yean send me that
like in here please
xD
But Richard Branson and Virgin want to make space ship that can actually work like a normal jet plane....
do tha barrel roll
:D
wait
we're here
yay
oops, nvm
xD
phase : where to land?

well, I think the most correct transslation would be Kreutzritter Burgen or something like that :P
I guess, yeah... not really sure
but translating titles always yields interesting results
is there anything going to be streamed?
no
all mods are asleep

Hey Dark92Enigma :D
Hi Havok!
how you're all doing?
Hahahhaah :D
dafuq is this?
what in equestria is that
brb.
hey thar Dark92Enigma Havok and DaringDerpy !
btw, i've noticed that Bronysith didn't show up here at all. He must be tasting the sour flavor of defeat
it looks friendly
Hey Lil_B :D
hey Lil_B :)
Dark92Enigma what happened?
how've you been Lil_B
time to do some grocery shopping
/me refeshes stream *what's so funny*
there is no stream
only paddels
Lil_B: Well, he always says ''Applejack will never get her song'' but she did!
applejack episode was worst episode
:O
Dark92Enigma I thought someone finally made him shut up and give him some sense
now i'm gonna say, oh hey, it's Brony-Applejack-will-never-get-her-song-bada-bing-bang-boom-paddy-waggy-francesca-the-third
You take that back now!
Phase4: Have some Satisfaction
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TvfR_bdOKE
DaringDerpy yeah... I really hated that episode yesterday :/
francesca-the-third-sith
*
btw, is it just me or does S3 has a Shitton of brony Fanservice?
it does. but i really liked yesterday's episode
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: GalaCon Vendor and Panelist Signups Open!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MwNWH4mMjA#!
and nopony laughed at my really long name
/me it's Tatopolous (whatever)
GalaCon... Europes biggest Brony-Convention... ahem... GalaCon had 400 Visitors, BUCK had 600 ...
not really
Electric_brony: I'm not an applejack fan.
haven't seen any fanservice in the episode yesterday
Have some more APPLEJACK SINGING
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1WtT6512oA
but the others were full of it
DaringDerpy: Wilhelm Scream, Babs Seed and BRAEBURN returning, AJ getting her song (for some, at least for me)
http://youtu.be/4sZuN0xXWLc
/me PS: Twi is still my favorite
A lot more Luna and and the return of Trixie...
I wanna hear Luna and Celestia sing.
You all know what's fun?
Ponies?
AJ's episode, the latest, is...
Best
Think about this, all other episodes, has been felt like it's been "fanserviced"...
However, this Episode...felt...
Season 1?
Dark92Enigma: nothing of it is really fanculture material
Say 1 fanservice moment in AJ's Episode
DaringDerpy: not even the Wilhelm?
One fanservice moment.
never heard it mentioned in the fandom
Noone comes with a fanservice moment
Therefore...
it didn't have the charm of season 1
Latest episode was the best. :P
ok, yesterday's ep wasn't the best, but i really enjoyed AJ having her episode
I haven't smiled once
Vordox: hold it!
hm...
ABLOOGALOOGALOO
Dark92Enigma: Bring proof of fanservice moement!
Anything happening?
Vordox: I will!
Dark92Enigma: Objection! THere is NONE!
falling stars? nope,
Falling stars is not a fanservice.
baby AJ?
damn
Baby AJ = How can that be a fanservice
We never seen her before in that state
Ever.
Falling stars = Symbolises AJ's parents, and was done WAY before it ever got created.
Lauren Faust's own words, so not fanservice =P
Return of Braeburn/Other Apple members = Errr. they are family, and all was coming so not fanservice =P
point taken. :( You win this round Vordox, this round :|
There was only one fan service I think...
You did mention Baby AJ, wasn't there any Baby Applejack in a precious episode?
Ah no wait, that was AB's picture books when Granny talked about it
Nevermind =P
hi
now we need to see the others as babies!
^
i bet dash wouldnt wear a diaper at all.. or on her head
baby aj was concentrated D'awww
but wouldnt fluttershy have one on and also one on her head?
if we ever see baby fluttershy....
Hai imma back
it may cause D'awwwsplosions
2 diapers on baby fluttershy
Phase4: shouldn't you be like... asleep?
a diamond diaper on rarity
Eli, bah, sleep is for the weak!
I should
Phase4: true, but i like to be weak from time to time
It's like 10pm where I am.
LOL

I meant, are you apathetic to it?
Ah

Hello all

hi
hi
And there are no signs of life anywhere.
/me 's corpse dances around
cachi01: Sorry for the Late Reply, but i played Yume Nikki since it was first posted on 2chan.
Think of me as a japanese man, But can speak english...
wow
one does not simply download indie games with just seeing a link to it
it might be creepypasta >.>
cachi01: Silly you! Creepypasta is just a Creepy Story, but i'm used to scary stuff so i wint get scared that easily.
wint*
wont**
wat bout sonic.exe
Was honestly creeped out but not as much, about 10% i was creeped out.
cachi01: I think I'll regret it in the future, but what is sonic.exe?
cachi01: A creepypasta where a guy named tom gets a cd from his friend kyle, it appears to be haunted when he first plays it.. I think you can read the rest on Creepypasta Wiki.
Malavolent: ^
To the CPwiki we go then!
(that sounds wrong)
Malavolent: also read the dontplaythis.exe!
Malavolent: If you regret it, then you shouldn't have done that.
or dot.exe
or life.exe
Or BEN (Haunted Majora's Mask)
or thiswillkillyou.bat
ben is an amazing creepypasta
one of the best ones out there. did u know that the creator is making an indie movie right now?

Luna: Whats so bad about your medical condition?

07,01it's a long story Uboa-San
Lil_B: Oof.
nice to see you again Luna, and I hope that you condition will get better in the near Future
07,01sadly it won't...; it will only get worse.
Everlasting_Joy wasn't as bad as it sounds xD
/me Resets the counter.
Lil_B: Fair enough. I've seen my fair share of explosions and have had pity on the poor soul who had to clean it up.
Luna well, I don't want to ask you what it is, if you don't want to, but I still have my hopes up that it will get better for you
Everlasting_Joy xD
07,01you have a PM Lil_B
/me starts to tear up
Somehow i would never want to ask and keep it that way to know that it's very bad atleast.
hi Luna!
07,01hey Dark92Enigma
Anyone watch the show Psych?
why you're crying aniderp|bestcakeever ?
nope
/me swipes a piece of aniderp|bestcakeever's cake.

/me 07,01offers her pineapple juice
thanks babe, but a mimosa sounds good right now
i'll be back
well... this will be the first chirstmas without having any pets.. without having my dog
i grew up with a dog and a cat now both gone so no pets ;_;
aniderp|bestcakeever: What happened to your Pets?
/me hugs aniderp|bestcakeever *been there, sis*
:(
/me 07,01thanks Dark92Enigma for the support
Finally finished the sonic.exe creepypasta.
The ending ruined it tbh.
someone should stream elf.. jusy saying
Malavolent: Next: BEN (Haunted Majora's Mask)
If you like,
Uboa-San: I think I'll watch the gameplay of the sonic.
Sonic.exe?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Pony Graffiti Invading Argentina
Uboa-San: Yep.
Malavolent: After that, If you want. you can read the BEN DROWNED Creepypasta.

THIS IS FUCKING GAY
TF2 JUST CRASHES

Lil_B: What happened to the Armrests?

hmmm, don't use spotify :/ buut I'd prpbably just reckoment something Classical , or from a Video game... or something classical from a Video Game, like the "New classic - Dwelling of Doom" I love the Atmosphere there, puts me right to sleep
07,01dont need sleep
Uboa-San now they are laying in a corner... they take away to much height so the cCHair doesn't fit under the Keyboard Part of the new Table
Lil_B: Have you tried to take them away?
Uboa-San well, they are away now, I got a Armrestless Chair now :P
/me whimpers from her chest hurting

Hi bronystate.
Howdy FillyFlam!
CriticKitten I recently found a Snapshot I took of Bronystate at the Tom Awardss, you are on it :P
hello FillyFlam
no FillyFlam, i wont buy what youre selling :3
wait... FillyFlam is on it too!
Lyra`: Aww, but I have this premium set of diamond-encrusted salt shakers with your name on it~
http://i.imgur.com/vculc.jpg
unf, ths girls voice in this music im listening too is seductve :3
nooooooooooooo
then its probably mine, FillyFlam
Lil_B: Wat?
http://youtu.be/mkdwUgd6iMA if you like old Synths
CriticKitten don't "WAT?" me! ... what's wrong?
!cd
Episode 9 of season 3 "Spike at Your Service" airs in 5 days, 23 hours, 8 minutes, 35 seconds (Dec 29 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
I'm guessing it'll be a spike episode
Nothing's wrong. Well, nothing apart from all the things that are normally wrong, plus the flu. XD
CriticKitten, im a medic, let me help :3
do you have the cure for the flu?
i do
cowvarkian look at that Bacon Sizzle!
>_ >
lel wat
Well considering the vaccine for the flu doesn't even always prevent it....no, he probably doesn't have a cure. :p
*she
and i do have the cure :3
are you a wizard?
Seems legit.
and/or from the future
07,01hey kitten
/me 07,01waves
wiith youre level of technology, yes, it would seem as tho im a wizard
hey Luna
*your
also, ive already drank too much.
well, I wouldn't expect anything else from you, Lyra`
my face is all red, and im feeling affectionate
07,01oh oh
I knew it. You're always drunk. And that wasn't even a joke.
of course she's always drunk
Lyra`: dont you always?
I can't wait till I get through in the Lottery , finally wanna see Metropolis getting showsn here http://youtu.be/cj8pmovHLvQ
most of the time i feel a vast superiority too all you mortals
but a tolerant superiority
oh you
Ninjazz have I already shows you the Picture?
and you should be lucky for it.
inb4 Lyra` snaps and kills us all
Ninjazz because you are on it too :P
Hey Luna. *waves*
It's funny how you say that when you're mostly on your knees.
pff Lyra` wouldn't find me in the magical Land of Hessen
Lil_B, oh? No I don't think you have. Also show me! I miss them days. :_;
Some superiority you have there
Ninjazz: http://i.imgur.com/vculc.jpg
and what do you do jmo?
I'm certainly not on my knees.
oh jaymoo, you don't even have legs
At least my particular dose of flu is down to just a very obnoxious tickling-cough and a minor-at-best fever.
the reason i am on my knees all day, is because i often have a shot or dying man im trying to stablize
Na, it's for other reasons.
my profession is a combat medic
Lyra`: didn't we all know that already?
and untill you have seen a mans lower face blown off by a grenade
Lil_B, holy crap. :_;
I've seen a mans lower face blown off by a blasting cap
or a man ran over with a track vehicle and his head pop, then have to scoop up his brain matter
XP
Uh-huh
how about you not talk to me, and move out of your parents house
dat jaymoo
what a fun profession
Na.
maybe when you have actually seen something worth making you live for
i'll accept criticism from you.
This is a really fucking dumb conversation.
it really is
Meanwhile: this is a conversation?
Pissing contests usually are.
Ninjazz I took it because this was the best moment I ever had at Bronystate, and I wasn't even visiting Bronystate for 1 month then
Hah.
nope'
Lil_B, really? Huh. That was... May wasn't it?
Hey Meanwhile finally, the last Guy I have to show the Picture too, (maybe also the last Guy who would care about it :/ )
probably both
Ninjazz I think so
picture you say'
There are starving kids in Africa who can't even read and they care more about this picture than I do.
Lyra` yes, the same one I have been talking about for aprox 15 min
link me :3
well, you have no eyes, so that makes sense Meanwhile
Meanwhile probably
Lil_B: took it becasue of silverscren?
Lil_B, thanks for sharing. Barely remember any of that though but maaaan seeing some of those again.
Lyra` well, it's just really something for the people who were there at the time, so it is probbaly nothing interestionmg for you, but I can't prevent you from looking at it anyway :P
Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/vculc.jpg
you could kill her
oh right
that one
Fuck Babes in Toyland.
Dark_Horst mainly because I was fascinatingly happy at the events of that time and I wanted to keep a reminder :)
Meanwhile xD
What was that one line? "I got you something you'll really like!" "Oh! A blender?"
00,10but babes in toyland was great it had furrys in go carts
I do
also sumica, dat comment
Food processors are what it's at.
hell ya
That guy from ABC Warehouse would.
Sumica I don't know if I should be happy or sad that I wasn't at Bronystate when this Movie got shown :/
Happy.
00,10that's like geting socks.......for your car
/me 07,01hugs Sumica
Be very happy.
/me hugs Luna
Meanwhile ok
/me is now as said
00,10I was indifrent.
00,10the movie was boreing but we also had a good movie
Lil_B: Look at this and be happy. http://i.imgur.com/gch73.gif
00,10and I had chillidogs
Ignore the 19 year old Keanu Reeves in Toyland.
babes in toyland was incredibly boring when it wasnt busy being stupid
best video ever
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLdmoX8UsRA&feature=share&list=PL20784B09DA54FBB3
I'm back.
its a baby with a moustach being drunk
also, electric swing
Meanwhile that would go well with the early 80's Synth Song I found a few mins ago
Lyra`: i'm sorry, but that medal goes to this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Gx8hYi0hQ
00,10welp I am beat from work so sleep now.
Sumica: i kinda liked that movie too
Sleep well Sumica!
i am beat from my late night partying
good night Sumica
im going to wake up
love you sumica
Yeah, it's one of my guilty pleasures
good sleeps Sumica
But Dark_Horst, that's not even http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl-rcmNLv8k
that was a prettty good video
i'll give you that
Which one?
Everlasting_Joy: the good one
the wizard one
I wasn't here Friday.
Or Saturday.
that was so wizard
I'll check the front page.
If only everyone made that deduction.
Meanwhile: To check the front page? Yeah, no kidding.
Unfortunately asking for common sense from the majority of this audience is like asking a chicken to lay square eggs.
its been done
Meanwhile: I was going to go with "discovering cold fusion", but that works.
Hence the point being that it's an absurd rarity.
/me parachutes into the chat and sits on a chair, smoking an old-timey pipe and reading the newspaper
sounds fun
I remember watching "Beavis & Butt-Head" when I was but two years old.
sounds like bad parenting
Are you nuts cowvarkian?! That's a good life!
I was watching Family Guy, South Park, King of the Hill, Beavis & Butt-Head, the Simpsons, etc. when I was 6 weeks old
I had a tv in the womb.
/me sells propane & propane accessories
/me sells apples and apple accesories
ok, I'm inactive now, I want to try out Empire Earth, got it on gog during the sale
The earliest memory I have was that time when I decided to pour milk into our Super Nintendo.
Lil_B: Which empire earth?
the first one + the add-on
aww... I have the second one
Ninjazz: How did that end?
me too, on Disc, bought it when it came out, but I hated it Kipkat07_Scarf
I remember my first rage quit: I was four years old and I had a game boy advance. I was playing rugrats and I lost all my save data. broke my game boy in half on my knee
Lil_B: you still has?
Kipkat07_Scarf I still have it :)
PLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqr5jzXleK0 <-- AHAHAHAHAHHAAH
I think I tried, but Vista didn't didn't let me... strange, I managed to get so many other and even older games to work, but Games between 2001 and 2005 somehow don't wanna Run on Vista
Ever...welp he went.
My earliest memory... eather hating Kindergarden or ... Playing Donkey Kong Country on the SNES somehwere... I haven't seen an SNES evenm since
Stupid chat crashed...
Everlasting_Joy, it broke. And my father got pissed off at me. Especially since he was playing it as I was pouring.
Poor Mario. Never saw the light of day again.
XO.
AWWW FUCK!!! My nose is bleeding
i lose a LOT of blood when my nose bleeds
enough to make me faint
flutter chu?!
Anon, he's not here
Kipkat07_Scarf: How much must that be?
a lot
but last night we were talking and we were having lots of fun
aww damnit... blood all over my damn keyboard...
hair deflates
he'll be back later anon
blood sucks getting out of your keyboard
this is NOT what I need when Im already sick.
Lyra`: wut?
how would crossover eddsworld and my litte pony
FUCK.... vision fading....
How do I shot web.
Kipkat07_Scarf: Go to sleep then
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Music: The Heart Carol (Aftermath Remix/Extended Cover ft. BluNoseReindeer) / Places That I've Never Been / ) Under My Wings
i would ship rarity and matt from eddsworld
well I'm going to go lay down so I can faint and not get my computer bloody
pony_1242: No.
Get well soon Kipkat07_Scarf!
I missed Luna. Oh no.
That reads incredibly sarcastic.
What?
The sentence looks very sarcastic to read.
^
Sorry.
Didn't mean any sarcasm.
No need to apologise, just the way it seemed.
sighs
so what now
g2g,

J_E_Smith71: just go with it, she wont hurt you if you dont resist
Maybe I should have made the joke when the chat was fuller...espically since I just popped in to make it before I go to eat
D:
I need some food too.
i like the actors in the cast of Star Trek TNG, they each are very unique
i just saw a car commercial where a car drives off a cliff, and the disclaimer sez "Fictionalization. Do not attempt. Cars cannot fly"
dat bolding
mcmiag how do you do the bold letters?
Dark92Enigma: its against the rules so dont do it

ikr?
Dark92Enigma: racist barn?

here it goes
poor applejack, they half assed her song
08,01Bronysith: you should see the bluray HD remasters
by the way, here you are, Mr. Brony-Applejack-will-never-have-a-song-paddy-waggy-francesca-the-third-sith, my full name is Dark-Say-what-you-want-about-the-episode-or-the-song-Twi-is-still-my-favorite-pony-92-Enigma
is there any way to suggest movies for next week or do we just type them here? XD
08,01they're FANTASTIC
there's the joke
and btw
Picard is best Captain
08,01AJ's song was shit, though
08,01easily worst song of the series
08,01with all the depth and appeal of a mouldy pancake.
come on, what did you expect from AJ's song (besides that it sounds wrong)
How quick to criticize what you have? Wow.
now that I've caught you!
Nittany_Discord: part of your cutie mark looks like the symbol for a cold front to me but whats the other part?
but as BaconMane said: what did you expect, it's country!
