my tablet can stream this without issue
One of the QA testers decided to be an asshole and leak it
STOP BEING A PUSS HUCK
Adventure!
the most i would do would be let a friend play it with me round my house
if i was a tester
that sucks
that's it ordering another
11,01Or, it's going through it's orbit.
No more BSUs means I'm going to forget about the project
Aight. Back to school with me for another 2 hours.

all we need now is the california raisins XD
WTB/10
OPUUUUUUUUZZLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
exactly
means less testers
No
Means no testers
period
Now a repeat of this
/me slow claps
Again for good measure
00,03So you don't forget..
sorry, I meant closed development
people making it still count as testers to me
Okay then
Anyway
Ffffff
Okay, kidz...
Go up to them, and say "BUCK YOU"
00,03Say Rarity is worst pony, then they'll at least pay attention to you
Melty Blood, you say? I might try it.
This kind of reminds me of Terranigma.
Although I hate practicing against CPUs...they're no fun.
Uh guys, what's this?
/me is experiencing a deficiency in Yankees from Connecticut and pre-medieval Europe
its more fun lol
imo
They had them sign something
And "NDA Agreement" I think they said
lol, then the leak is screwed
they'll have him by the balls on this one
The link was taken down in seconds of it being posted, but people still have it.
I doubt they'll go after the tester though. It doesn't seem like something they would do.
00,03AAND then I do a moodswitch
and there we go
OH HEY THERE IS THE LEAK
o.o
WOHO
Good
dat moodwhiplash
/me Can't. Stop. SMILING! :D
We really need this.
wut? :P

leak?
i just cant get it out of my head
My condolences to the FiM team...
someone call for a plumber?
OH NO BUFFER
DONT DO THAT NOW D:
I need this after that movie
NOW
Honestly, I'm surprised people would do this? You KNOW how this hurts developers.
/me smiles :D
I keep hearing that as Friendly Snoppy Friends of Mine.
I do hope they go after the leak though, if only to teach the person that actions have consequences
00,03Oki, I am done for the night!
00,03See y'all tomorrow!
they shoulda been more careful
they should but probably is just going to end in an agrement from both parts and no court involved

Taking money from him would be against the project's philosophy of freeness.
QA = quality assurance
Quality Assurance.
essentially testers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z13d3UgQ1U4&feature=channel&list=UL
I just feel sad about it. Those poor guys.
It's as much an emotional blow as it is a practical one.
why would someone leak it? people can't be patient anymore can they -_-
:(
try /mlp/
eww 4chan

I cannot be nommed right now because I am burning. With. Rage.
SPOILERS it was his sled
because some idiot leaked it, we have to wait longer
Yeah I know they're stronger. But this is the kind of risk that's been taken here.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-p0CIz9R04&feature=related
The worst part is that I can't even see WHY a tester would leak the build.
most of em have no shame
wow. The /mlp/ where FiM mediafire link is just... going nuts
I don't think you can quash that
oh man
i gotta get i on this

11,01Forgot about Maid Hour. Fucking panic attacks.
whois streaming
ATM, nopony
darn
To a certain extent, I could care less if other people play it. Rubbing in the fact that it was leaked and "trolling" about it --- that's harsh
I remember when people hated the CMC. Because, you know, how dare this children's cartoon have children in it.
/me is still simmering
OMG IT FINISHED
Is anything streaming, because I see nothing on my end.
This is glorious.
I'm not good with kids. Therefore I would prefer an episode without the CMC. Yet, they are cute and admireable
This whole leaked deal has made my night.
lol
cachi01:it's not worth it, its not even the full thing
:P
dammit
a kid is free to act like an idiot. An adult doing the same thing --- well, you can't
So...a dream episode maybe? That could work...
Hello everypony
Oh man
Why is the stream farting on my best enemy and my worst friend?!
O_o oh my...Opal?!?
It's a complex issue. Definitely not because I hate kids. I just don't like responsibility of something going wrong.
PINKIE. PIE.
WHY ARE WE YELLING?!
PINKIE PE!
I constantly get "You made my kid do this! Shame on you!"
PIE*
I hate that.

Hey is there a stream? I got nothing?
Neither do I
This is delicious

Someone leak Equestria Online or something

Is this like some strange version of My Little Pony
Omg! It is! :o
You scared the s:ot out of me with sudden stream o_o

Second, do you use an undersketch?

MOV?
GIGGLE AT IT!

/me giggles
/me giggles at the ghostie
why is everyone freaking out wha was on stream?

Only asking because I can't tell; it's hard sometimes to guess the process from the end product.
Well, all of those EXCEPT GW2.
except for the ones that aren't out or already ded
o.o'
LOL
'Lo?
It wouldn't be in theaters since it's based off of a fanfic
00,10would probably be boreing to watch though
but I don't know for sure . . .
also another thing is its a bad idea to make a movie based on that i mean sure the story has emotions and some confilcts but othe then that i cant see it working
Right now, Starcraft 2 is undergoing technical issues with 1.5
00,10Actaly i never said it was't me =p
00,10trololol

Oi, then knowing it would help

And no sarcasm there, it's a nice eraser, I wish I had an eraser like that
I already know how I feel about it.
I do want to do that!
get in the jar!
Okay
i don't :p i make smudges too often
stop that
Say you wanted to draw a head\
*strings
k
no stings. lol. THE BEES!
Found a little easteregg in GW2 today http://i.imgur.com/BuR1l.jpg :P
hahahahaah
Most commonly circles, triangles, rectangles, and their three-dimensional counterparts.
HEY WAKE UP
awake?
http://mylittledashie-movie.tumblr.com/
sooo skeleton ?
A bit like a skeleton.
A head would start as a circle, and then built on to make the rest of it.
An arm is two cylinders joined by a sphere.
ugh! I can't find it. It was a pic of Rarity in a potatoe
The torso is a bigger, squatter cylinder bonded to a pyramid-thingy by a ball.
Bye everypony
I can keep searching, if you want
*Ahem* Bai, everypony! ^-^
With a pony, it would look somethign like this: http://www.bmloeffelman.com/pictures/MLP/quick_undersketch.jpg
well artists dont matter you need DIRECTORS AND PEOPLE WITH FILM EXPERIENCE
Bitch and a half, I know.
and actors
I usually just look hard at it and take a wild guess.
Okay, okay, it could be good. It MIGHT be good.
Anyway yeah, undersketches.
*these
Fundamental artistic skill. Mastering the undersketch is a massive leap forward for graphic artists.
I'm just saying that the odds are that it won't be.
hey everyone!
Less important for classical or abstract/non-objective artists.
:)
If I could give you one tip, I'd tell you to use undersketches.
Seriously, they're that important.
Circles come out rounder, legs come out the right length, and eyes get placed properly in the head.
nothing much
With the right understanding of a pony's underketch, you can draw it in any pose whatsoever without reference.
dunno been use this one sometimes http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7bS-XNQmBnk/TeX7B0XqZMI/AAAAAAAAFTE/AWktwZT1XAA/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg

;D
Need to see
I don't draw ponies nearly often enough
i did read the rules i had some help from a good friend he told me to be chill i am postive you know him!
all depends on how much detail you're getting into :3
Ooh
That is a VERY good ref guide for ponies
lol
oh flutterecry eh?
ouvbhwrglvuehvgtwilight_sprinklegvnaerhveg

Although when actually drawing you have to make allowances for personal style.
My ponies always come out looking vaguely manga-ish...my fault for drawing the same thing for years >.>

What's the difference between a regular layer and a linework layer?
linework is a vector layer
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIaIaoZvfvA&feature=g-vrec
different set of options for it
regular is bitmap
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKiRIMDNj4A&feature=relmfu
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVxtyaATq8 Pay close attention to the Lyras and Bon Bon
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&list=ULYdbcr2KhD1Q&NR=1&v=4PjIhs72l0A
not really, I only pop one up if I need a reference for lighting
ALL the links
draw out some line from a light source, and since they're vectors they're going to give you a straight-edge unless you mess with them

/me Today I learned several things.
Thanks :3
:D
Fans of Looney Tunes qualify as furries.
brb
trust me
most celebrities are actually furry
/me Second, every team has a control freak, and when said freak is at the head of the project, well, you're screwed.
i now feel like an otter that has just plucked the tinyist swig in the damm, collapses and destroyed furtile farm land :D
nooo
Even if you give them a hefty legal document, they might not be thrustworthy still
Night everyone.
Wow, I have never actually watched the sun rise before :)

Would you?
is it bad?
Change subject to pigs and pigmasks
then good
PIGS.
I'm just stating my stand on this, I WANT to play it, but it's NOT out yet.
We've been told to drop the subject several times guys
I mean, why stop the Bite Size Updates?
Guys. DROP IT
Just like the Clean version of CMC Theme, or the cut of the Soundfiles etc etc from FiM, anything that's done by anyone should be respected.
Or we won't ever get nice things.
13Enough.
13Drop the subject about the leak.
Exactly.
aw ok :<

Yes please
uh-oh

oooh
I can't post some lindsey anymore
:<
is that good?
wait, LoL is a MMO?
LoL isn't even an MMO
No.
It's not. That's my point.
LoL is MOBA
Multiplayer Oline Battle Arena
. . . that is?
oh
.
sorry about that
Hai.
certainly doesn't sound like a MMO, and I don't play them
LoL is free
05not much of a stream
05but it'll do untill i gotta dash
there's no strategy in controlling one single caharacter
I never cared for LoL personally
character**
Much perfer SC2
I know the origin and all but I still can't see LoL as an RTS at all
O_O
Argue with Wikipedia, not me. :p
pfft, Wikipedia
I really dun give a crap how MOBAs are organized.
Clearly they should make a SoTC MMO.
Random music videos.
they actually called it Action RTS?
BS
I hate being wrong
though I was half right
yeah
whatever happened to tht anyway?
did anybody here play the leaked Fighting is Magic?
I did
no
but we should put a halt on the subject here
05no i got standards
05rather wait for a release
oh, sorry
That's fine
I did attempt to end it there
:3
Or in another channel
Fluttershy is best poney

pinkie pie is my fave :3

i think ceaser doesnt like being watched
Cab you color the dirt?

Lame
05oops
05yeah

05screensnapr is much handier
http://screensnapr.com/v/aLAoG8.png and inside the current side buildings
paint
screensnapr is just a ctrl1 and select from part of the screen
once my servers running again ill be using that for storage as well
I take picture of the whole screen. Then on paint I crop it
or you just http://screensnapr.com/v/zFjIz8.png

no need to crop
is the stream over?
05and no need to manually upload
hurro everyone
05nah itll be bac up soon

Caser.
Caeser&
Caeser* Fml
i left my old cause they lost emails from jobs i applied to
and the one saturn recommended, Gandi, only has sftp, and for somethings i do i need ftp
00,02Chrysalis, you can use gandi as just a dns host and have an external webhost
i have a domain already, i pointed to them as a host
Sad times when you remember old MMOs you used to play that have since died.
00,02free ones like 000webhost are fine for not hosting anything important
its my portfolio
and i use the php/ftp/mysql for program interop
Nah
00,02dont'
I got over it a while ago
Suure you did.
i do pay for my host
That is how I took a picture of derpy inside the snowglobe in episode 44 a friend in deed
Yeah
lolrunescape
oh wow, runescape
00,02Chrysalis, nfshost is good, service is great and you get ssh access

I had completed all the nonmem quests and I was lvl 55 then I forgot my password and the email I used's password as well
I just can't get into MMOs

Based on a book.

But then again, a lot of films have sudden endings

Movies tend to cut out many scenes that help with the plot from the bool.
They suddenly get arrested and that's it, the French win

11,01That the streamer is taking requests.
#vinyl_scratch
