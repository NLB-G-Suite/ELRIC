ship it then?
haha
if its a gift you have to have paperwork showing it is a gift and then it has to have some sort of value on it.
what's the worst shipping you can think of?
Worst shipping? 500 dollars for a plushie
/me totally missing hte point totally not on like purpose
Hi everypony!
Y u remind me ;_;
hai Kawaii
hehe
"Yeah those damn americans keep on trying to get into our country."
Still don't see how shipping could cost that much
Probably bad autocalculator
or fill a whole container
Har har har :P
with just one plushie

I've been on that site since like 2nd grade. The only reason I go now is for body mod advice.

Hey, everyone.
08,01Buytoast: i'm a good programmer
Good, how are you doing?
08,01Chrysalis: i'm indian.
Anything planned for tonight?
damnit
i'm, just giving up on it
you win Saturn
maybe treat it like a hobby
08,01at first i thought i was a failure
08,01because i suck at maths
08,01i mean
Audio engineering is fun when you get to do the shows
usually its all the in built PA system
which is a little dull
08,01but then i discovered programming
but when you get to do a proper system, then you see a famous person use it
its awesome
though ill warn you
evil*
Basshunter is a little.. enthusiastic
in thanking engineers
08,01with it
it isn't Saturn
but they have the need to make it like that

doing ok thanks
People have this strange desire to make it seem like their lives matter.
otherwise it doesn't make tehm special snowflakes
Fuck knows why.

Saturn excellent comment :)
08,01Friendship is Insidious

Go fgiure.

I'm ok with them
or look at tutorials

Saturn shhh
08,01easy
we need everyone to get pi's
I learned as a teenager by messing around with c++
just read some books

DAMN YOU KEYBOARD
i gave up on an academic career with programming, but i'm still learning with books
Rule 2: GoTo Rule 1
08,01okay everypony
I dont think I could ever do programming commercially, but as a hobby its great.
He's called Jack
Good night guys :)
08,01add screen, etc.
11,01I like programming, but I'm sure I want a career in it.
11,01*not
I'm going to be idle for a bit. Later! XD
08,01Ã©ek
11,01I liked making things as a kid too.
is there a stream on?
Bye!
I find it odd that I plan on building my own computer, but don't know a thing about programming and shit.
/me 08,01is on his mother's compuer
That's not programming that's more electronics
Saturn can STREAM now!?
08,01ASoftFluffyThing: they are completely disparate things
Don't need to know much to build a computer though
I'm not leaving i'm saying bye to soemone else :D
11,01Put some parts together and install an OS. Easy.
or some pliers
conveniently all the ports are different shapes
08,01Michael: out! get out!
those would be nice too
08,01:P
Saturn: xD
No it is a being
13testing again
huh still no stream
08,01bitch, it's a kernel
Putting a computer together with consumer parts is pretty trivial. Everything plugs into one another where its supposed to go.
08,01Lil_B: i use Xubuntu
I was told that ArchLinux was favorable
08,01because XFCE is <3
shizumobileblack screen atm
archlinux is good.
I hear sound!
08,01Vivix: whoever told you that clearly hates you
Hehe, maaybe~~ they were powernerds

Saturn I was thinking about Lubuntu, but I could try it

Its a romhack, kinda
I wish it did date pidgeons-
Bye, Socks. :)
inmense hiatus right there

Bye socks!
And yet pony fans are somehow reviled.
08,01Vivix: pigeons are delicious

I saw an image now!

And sometimes, they come with notes attatched :'(
Oh well, there's enough pigeons to go around, I suppose
08,01this was about 10 years ago
08,01then i tried Mandrake
Lindows? Never heard of O.o
08,01Vivix: now called Linspire
Never heard of that either.
08,01heh, ReactOS is a great idea

The only other OS I remember from childhood is O/S2

First computer I ever used for real was a Commodore PET.
I hearda bout that, but isn't it more or less completely unrelated to the old machines?
wow
Commodore PET? Hn, never tried one of those
I was--5-6 at the time
Anyone here having experience on SSD drives not showing up at boot configuration in bios?
11,01Didn't know Commodore was still in business.
They were purchased by somebody
08,01on an Intertec Superbrain
08,01used a zilog z80 processor
ohh tape drive
Holla everypony! :)
Had a staggering 8K or RAM running on a .5 MHz processor.
Saturn computer world moves crazy fast
08,01also, if anyone owns a TI graphing calculator of TI-83 or above, and below a TI-89, it uses a zilog Z80 CPU
It's--bizarre to think about
they are evil
11,01I've used a TI-89.
08,01the TI-89 uses a motorola M68000 processor
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET
Oh, sorry. It has 4K and a 1 MHz 6502 CPU.
boots with a one-inch heel
08,01i've harly ever used it
Tech talk... I expect I'll be lost before long.
08,01i learned assembly on a 6502 based machine
Assembly? Now that's something that always scared me away from coding
08,01unless you're doing x86 assmeply
hey there everypony
*your
08,01Vivix: if you want to learn assembly, learn MIPS32 assembly
It's like all the pressure goes to the ball of my foot
:D thanks
is there a stream
08,01Lil_B: ha! yes, i can sympathise with you there...
I was always fascinated by the step like- how programming languages are made, how you create them, but I never learned about it
*fairly
*=/
Sunshine and sci-fi movies
It doesn't help me that my ankles are like jello, and give out randomly while I'm walking in heels.
or gaming
08,01seriously, the height of technological adancement where i grew up was generally using top-bar hives instead of the dome ones...
Saturn I got an CD qwith an Emulator and a ton of old games... that got me interrested :P
Yeah, that happens to me too <_<
Everyone in my family of the gender male are nerds
My ankles give out randomly anyway, but with heels especially.
but- I'm interested in programming and computer, but- I guess I fell out of the nerd crowd ages ago-
08,01brb
my parents are nerds
nerd parents are fun
I don't think I'll be able to get to the gym tonight. (*BLARG*)
Hm?
Well I got a lot of the patterning from Cpp, but for JS I ask people when I'm stuck, and read up on W3C definitions
that's about it
Yeah :(
...I think I should gom out and plant potatoes...
I do read articles to understand Arrays and such- because that baffled me, and I did read a tut on drawengines to see--what was normal
but once you get commands and definitions and the--basic flow down, you just think "how do I solve this"-- it comes a bit easier
JS is easy though, I guess
Hard to master, but easy to--begin with?
aah

Yeah, I thought these would be okay since they're not like that
Turn into Optimus Prime and fight Megatron.
Do people just train themselves to wear them, or are they always this painful?

11,01No.
some tennis shoes can look nice >.>
That may be the way to go. Although if you want nice looking shoes, you could always consider flats.
I was gonna add the jacket to it
but I wasn't sure if you'd like that or not
Actually I tend to avoid flats because they give me blisters on the backs of my heels :(
11,01He normally doesn't wear the vest, but you're OK with drawing him wearing that.
Oh, that sucks.
You know I was going to say that it does..
I guess tennis shoes it is then.

the best one is need for speed world because its multiplayer and you can do whatever the fuck you want

Cola is yucky
You need something with..."TASTE":P
It did, in cola's case
I am really unclear about where the line is between normal and "prostitute boots" :P

Crysis?
Whats the fatal velocity for humans?
Yes
Timber.
MMMM dat destructibility
Was this before the frostbite engine?
... my expiriment just showed: with uncoherent noises in the backgrouind, the writing ability does decrease
I cant recall
you reach terminal velocity in about 14 seconds
Well crysis 3 or two has a bow instead of a gun

stop being jerks to the trees
You know I could be wrong but I'm not sure if lumberjacking was in the mission parametres.

Maximun pun
08,01fuck this noise
08,01anyhoos

/me goes to find a blanket
Well he died

Once upon a time.

oh wow that rifle sounded good.
Maximum overdrive.

They cemented the whole queens are evil shit
^
Maximum ALL the things!
MAXIMUM PONY
11,01Princess Celestia is legally a queen.
But logicly if NO ONE IS ABOVE YOU IN RANK you should be king/queen
technically you'd get a lot of unfortunate implications if both celestia and Luna were queens together
11,01But they'll never call her Queen Celestia unless she goes evil.'
08,01well
/me has a blanket now
since its a diarchy I suppose its okay if they're both princess'
08,01i'm a queen
right?
08,01so techincally, i outrank cleestia.
ello everypony
lol you would Saturn XD
i belive it Saturn
Saturn: Until they appoint her as "Super Queen".
no talking lions
Maximum Queen
Maximum Wubs
FAil
Those guys have pretty good aim.
Marketing
this must be crysis
11,01Saturn, you don't look like a queen.
Kings don't have the evil connotation I think.
BOOM
08,01Nittany_Discord: you've never seen me naked.
kings usually die
People usually die
they die being good
11,01And I don't want to.
People die when they are killed. Except when they don't.
twilight is royalty-in law
no
Scootalooooooooo

/me doesn't really care for cosplay
11,01Thought about cosplaying, but I felt too embarrassed to do it. I've also never been into conventions.
because I look like him
cosplaying scosts money
then again, I could always cosplay as a time lord
Regarding obscure pony cosplays, I have yet to see a Featherweight cosplay. Any other background ponies come to mind?
i could cosplay as myself
^
11,01Thought about doing it for Halloween, but I could only think of things I can't dress as.
thats about as far as id go in cosplaying
maybe get a lab coat walk around, thats the most id bother
GIMME 20 DOLLAHS
But seriously

08,01i was trying to figure out whether he was cold-reading or using another method
If it gives them ease-of-mind let it go Saturn

o_o
08,01which makes it even worse

Those are cuckoos, different animal

lol
I've never played Uprising.
:I
I've only ever played the first two games, and the gameboy one I've not touched in maybe fifteen years.
I recommend the 3DS one.
It has a LOt of variety in terms of weapons.
And the story is good as well.
And it has a great score
Any time is a good time for tea :)

13that's probably my favorite scene from rebuild 1 >>
"Ow, that really hurt. But hey, at least I'm not dead!" :D
there is none.
okk
we need to rewatch rebuilds before 3.33 comes out

Except when you have a digestive wound, probably colon or stomach. Otherwise, it's a good cause of peritonitis.
