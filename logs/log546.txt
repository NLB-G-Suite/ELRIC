cold, hard facts
11,01Theory: Unproven scientific fact.
Then download desktop ponies and spawn Fluttershy or get a fluttershy wallpaper
11,01A proven scientific fact is a law.
:P
MY LITTEL PONY IS MY IPOD WALLPAPER
in fact eveything at any moment has a alternate unverse where things happen for instance in this one i eat some food (in another dimension i may not and it goes off from there)
11,01Or a law.
11,01You can sign up for our newsletter.
"Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative."
11,01But laws trump theory.
11,01Scientific laws.
11,01Laws of motion. Laws of thermodynamics.
can we get pony music please?
or at least some happier tunes?
WITH EVERY action there a reaction
I have theories but not really scientific just Philosophical (I pretty much have a philosophical point of view in life)
Laws are simply statements of behavior within certain parameters. Many of those laws operate within theories.
i dont

there's a difference between temporary, justified snapping and real crazy, too...
Hay everypony
Long time no speak?
it is when you can sneak up on someone without them knowing
Rain......i dont understand that concept
Hypothetically, I see someone doing unspeakable things to my nearly 2 year old niece, and I'm likely to snap someone's neck. Normally that would be crazy, but in that instance, it'd be justified.
Rain: I DONT UNDERSTAND THAT CONCEPT IN THE LEAST
"Yes"
/me takes the fruit
well i guess I am sane cuz I never act out
/me takes the fruit away
I never do anything irregular
i am like I said before too sane

She was the bff of my twin sister

Hiya everypony!!!
a friend like pinkie might fix me I am the total opposite naturally
It can be lots of fun, but sometimes its just too much to handle
but not myself
can he/she break the 4th wall?
Where would the 4th wall be in RL?
Let's consider the implications of that :-P
4th wall*
A Twi-Flutter mixture is very easy to picture, actually...
I fit in rlly well everyone knows me I can accomplish anything I try but wat is the point in trying let alone living when we r slaves to society
You know, my grandmother on my father's side is marrying for the third time now. And she's 85.
fireworks popping everywhere o.o
Also, hello everypony!
It's like saying a fish in a river is a slave to the current.
I may have a bit of Luna aswell
we're discussing pony traits IRL
Oh yeah?
We are contained to the Earth, at least for now
yeah
well with laws a rules more comes with it
There need not necessarilly be mental limitations, and that's what's needed.

"fruit hour"?
-_(\
ever think maybe ppl r murderers, convicts, thieves, etc. from the implicatios of rules and regulations
:3
society and rules r one in the same
they come hand in hand
Rules and Laws are not the same thing, however.
Rules are governed
Laws are proven facts
Yes
why not kill each other if we can sensly kill animals then ppl all the same
but engagements traditionally happen about a year out

yayyyy lol
hey Polydunami!!^^
nvm
I'm getting deja vu here.
00,02sub06905, yeah, must be you
00,02its all correct here
has sound turned down :D
I'm getting sound
00,02XD
00,02sounds getting to fmle
dat calming music
she should watch more episodes with me soon (I have seen them all she hasn't)
00,02XD
00,02this is a decompile of version 3.66

00,02now
alright guys i'm going out for a while
baiii :D
"Spectrum" is next, right?
Oh man, I thought we were going to hear Beatrix's theme for a second.
g'nigh val- . . .
dammit, just mised
*missed
1 am and people still popping fireworks :D
Well I have a working drawing tablet
I was starting to get a little bit concered about my masculinity. Ya know. Watching a show intended for 6 year old females. But after looking through my baby photos I realised I lost my masculinity LOOONG ago.
Bah. Masculinity is for sissies.
00,02^
You also get a free card and reserved parking
club?
.
any catch?
:$
next is either "Spectrum" or "Everfree Showdown" . . .
I am a bad guesser
Oops
unless it's the preview vid
*v
*viches
00,02btw its online again
because my netbook sucks at paintchat
is it?
yep, it's the Trailer
But I guess
right now I can't seem to connect fully to it
00,02its not exactly efficent software

Damnit....
I killed my Jeb..
Two songs, one file
00,02oh
00,02Sumica, you meen its going to come out soon
on mp3
/me 00,02thought it was out now :'(
heh
I got alot of artists in my music folder
. . . "Ill Fly Higher" I believe this one is
Paintchat seems simlpe enough
3000 sub special
00,02cant wait :3
2000 sub special, sorry
but with the humidity it feels like 98.
00,02hmmm
00,02this is not helping
Night of Nightmares
Yep, it's THAT old xD
o hai everyone, doing good, you?
The Loyalest and Most Dependable - Applejack's theme
that's good! I am doing great
http://i.imgur.com/8nc4W.jpg
paintchat fixed? hooray!
I'm glad someone elses listens to these kind of songs.
Rain: want
cuz I'm awesome like that
3
Hm?
Nice.
04o-o panda...cheese?
04Oh, um, hi everyone
/me shakes head
This is a sensible design, albeit perhaps _too_ minimal to go for the Mun.
00,02dis one is allmost orbit capable
00,02needs more rockets
00,02Rain, it was a little larger than this
00,02was probably using quad
Hey... Planet earth is blue and theres nothing we can do.
04Ah, maybe sometime then
^-^
this is Lunar Nocturnality - Luna's theme
of course
00,02tri and quad are fundimentaly the same cradt
00,02craft'
00,023 stage, srb's on launch
00,10looks like some of the other things planed is weight and thrust calculators
00,023rd is the lander
Most successful rockets are going to be somewhat similar. Symmetrical, distinct staging, and a good lander design
00,02Sumica, that would be very helpfull
My lander's more complex than yours, but yours is absolutely servicable, and perfectly capable of minmus.
00,02cher3ry, you say that
00,02and yet both tri and Sumica's pyramid are mun capable
One sec
gotta load it up. Basically it's yours with three side half-tanks feeding into the central tank, and the landing legs are on the side tanks, to make it wider.
00,02cher3ry, i've thought of a design like that
00,02help with returns
also helps with landings. I can land on a fairly decent slope and still be ok
00,02Sumica, and it works and can be piloted to the mun
00,10yeah I know, I have taken it there a few times
00,10I have modified the desgine a bit
00,10I swaped out all the couplers with the ones that cover the nozzles
00,10added a bit more RCS and legs
00,02TheRandomkid321, not sure about mac
00,02i think there is a mac version
00,02.13 is free, this is .15.2
00,02Sumica, yeah?
00,10if you hook fule lines from side tanks to the nozzles on say a centerline booster
"I'll Fly Higher" - Scootaloo's theme
00,02Sumica, i did that with tri and quad
00,02gona do it on this one too
00,02wait
00,02do you meen draw from the connected tank or the whole assembly?
00,10say like on you currnt one on screen.
00,02yeah, thats the plan
00,10the booster attached to the fule line wont touch the tanks above it
00,10till the tanks the fuelline is hooked to are dry
00,10but you have to attche it directly to the nozzles
Anyway, my Munar lander: http://derpy.me/vpKCV
00,02i have silly plans for this
00,02ooo
00,02cher3ry, nice
light ships go out of control even with ASAS
00,02small one swings around
00,02heres where the silly starts
00,10I realy like taht some one made couplers taht hide the nozzles
yeah, thats one of the few mods I'd consider installing in my "clean" version. I have two versons, one modded and one stock.
just blow it up already
G'night
Ok this now looks like the pyramid of doom
"It's About Time" - Pinkie Pie's theme
"I have no idea"
He's reciting the music that's playing
Rain listing off the names of the AcousticBrony songs playing over the stream
oh
no
00,10this desgine looks famular =p
inb4 large explosion
00,10solids cliping, thats gonna be bad
And they also eject outward...
00,10they are gonna probably break
even dry that could be a problem
they are going to boom first
00,10all dem overheats
00,02well
I call hax
00,02that went well
oh theres the boom
againn
you ejected the liquids too soon?
again
00,10supprised the ejection charge on those center solids did't cause an issue
or did the solid ejection damage the liquids?
00,02JRP2234[Web], ikr
00,02cher3ry, not quite
00,02i meen yeah, more than enough
00,02but i want more
lol
it's still 68 years from escape
*love
lol\
00,02makes a prety paturn
00,02XD
that was long . . .
yeah that's my understanding
lemme check on mine
00,10oh boo, it never saved them
My goodness, the Sensorites are pacifist to no end.
it's 1:45 am here
00,02dis should go far
00,02Sumica, :(
00,02Rain, dat
I can't even find my escape path anymore, doesn't matter.
00,02WOULD BE EPIC
00,02and epic dificult
00,10easy fix, I just remake it
00,10but yeah no landing for that crew, it was just tons of SRBs
00,10is it leaning to the side?
color me surprised, it's not burning
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
it's rotating but that's ok as far as it goes
lotta vibration
should'e added some struts
he never braced the bases to each other did he
nup
00,02oh wow
00,02this has too much fuel
them's hanging free like redneck-balls
damnit, GalaCon is sold out T.T
00,02i'm looking at kerbin escape with the upper stage full
lol
you're titlting
"An Ode to Derpy Hooves" - Derpy's theme and 9000 sub special
personal favourite
yeah, he has no actual control over the bottom anymore, and not enough thrust to escape the bottom either
at least not safely
its going down ! oh nooo
highway to BOOOOOOM
Oh no
00,10oh dear
00,02well
00,02that was awesome
OH MY GOOOOOOOOODDD!!!!
dat panic eject
00,10almost got roasted by the boosters
yeah, Kerbin doesn't handle that situation well...
I'm back
:p
00,02sub06905, i have before
damn i missed the moon landing :3
00,10I realy want to try the whole spaceplane landing thing but I should probably give up on that idea
00,10unless i strap it to the ToP it's just not happening.
spaceplanes drive me batty...
00,02i cant build planes
00,02aparently i'm a master of rockets
huh
I think phase4's design is the only feasable shuttle method - strap the rockets to the sides.
00,02who cant build a plane
I was expecting an explosion
00,10Heavy 101 is the only desgine I got that is close.
central mount causes breakage
00,02cher3ry, you realy cant attach to the top/bottom
suddenly i have a "master of puppets" remake as "master of rockets"
mind you, I've never played this before
"Crepusclarity" - Twilight Sparkle's Theme
now granted, easier said than done!
00,10suddnly loud
I can't help you guys on these ones
this is kinda painful to my ears.
00,02this is kinda wrong for mun/minmus
00,02tri/quad are moon bound
00,02this is more of a interplanetary thing
00,02but theres no other planets
except there's only one planet
00,02Canadian_Brony, headphone bro's /)
Cnadian_Brony I don't liek the song volumes fine
I have headphones on too :D
Yeah
00,02hmm
remix of smile^3
00,02i dont know how to fly this thing
00,02and i didnt put enough rcs on it
but name of remix?
00,02Smile Song (The Living Tombstone's Remix)
00,02not liking this playlist much
00,02Rain, jk
00,02k'
00,02nah
00,02its drifting
use a bigger gyro!
00,02somethings slightly uneaven
the solids.
00,02the upper bit should be moon capable on its own
they're not perfectly symmetrical with the rest of the rocket's own drag
^
00,02yeah
00,02i have no control
lololololollololoolool
somehow its working
00,02upper part works fine though
RIP... Three aliens....
Kerbals are heroes!
00,02oh yeah
00,02this thing has tonns of fuel
Try to ille the aliend >:D
*KIll the aliens
00,02Canadian_Brony, it is
00,02i tend to drop tanks on the mun
I have headphones, a TV, computer, universal remote, but no phone
Ha ha.
at least not without mods
00,02der we go
00,02orbit
this is catchy
Dat orbit, very nice.
00,02cher3ry, i cant wait untill we can do that
I mean, REALLY catchy
song name?
Same. That'll make designing a lot more fun
00,02Canadian_Brony, pinkies lie
00,02so
00,02mun or minmus?
also this song is cool
/me is confuzzled
night peeps
I lpve dis song...
00,02hmm
00,02Sumica, oh, k
lol
00,10one is you are heading directly away from the othere is heading twords.
I am signign this song currently :D
/me is lip syncing instead
:3
/me is singing this at 2 am
I'm sure there's more fuel efficient ways to do it, but it's not a blindly stupid way either.
00,02waiting
00,02cher3ry, i'm not sure whats more efficent
00,02i just find kerbin orbit easier to aim
but that's math.
and a moving target
but that's still math :/
this playlist i starting to sound like my playlist :D
00,02WOAH
00,02dats an orbit
is*
No contracts? Good. I don't like putting my name around
00,02and allso setup lunar orbit
00,02which uses VERY little fuel
this seems deserving . . .
I think our moon is much more massive compared to Mun, tho.
00,02then drop the lander
00,02cher3ry, it is, but its less dense
and I'm back
hai everyone
00,02XD
how are you?
00,02^
00,02'sphere of influence' and all that
00,02physics engine cant do n-body's
screw physics, I'm Pinkie Pie
I'll stick to Chemestry, thx
*chemistry
00,02yeah
00,02i'm going to slow to zero then start falling
are you going to make it?
00,02cher3ry, it is imposible
I'm not positive it's literally impossible, but it's highly improbable.
00,02or impacting it
00,02eiter way, you need to slow once there
00,02or, in my case, speed up
ksp is the hardest thing ever, i cant even get into orbit
Bloomburg . . .
I'm gonna hit they hay NIGHT EVERYPONY! :)
00,02der we go
00,02lets try for landing
detatch the main vehicle!
prepare for landing!
/me Hugs #bronystate
/me was hugged
and naturally you have to land on the light side... and I think close to the prime meridian too.
not sure of the last bit
00,02good
00,02landing on the light side
derp
00,02cher3ry, dont HAVE to
that is all
00,02just very much prefered
00,02what with the lack of proper altimiter
yeah
well, I land by shadows usually.
my lander has plenty of fuel to do that tho
. . . eventually . . ?
00,02cutting it a bit close here
brb
hi Mister. Couldn't tell yah
CLOSE ENPUGH!
That's impressive there. Haven't managed that type of approach... might have to try it next time.
land aliens on the moon
*ENPUGH!
lol Kimple
*ENOUGH!
Prepare for landing...
. . . eventually . . ?
hey
00,02well
00,02shit
ouch
NO!
00,02i screwed that up bad
*boop*
lol
too much lateral speed. they survived, but are stranded.
Time for Nixon's speech
oh f*ck!
They came to explore in peace, and there they shall rest in peace.
spinning like a boss
I see...
00,10well at least they live
Is that supposed to happen *Points at screen*
Where are the enemy aliens?
00,02they could probably fix that
at least you made it to the moon
00,02Sumica, i think its the fith
My trip was worse
It was an impressive approach until the very end.
banishment is not a fun experience
00,02but yeah
No enemy aliens? This is great
This time brig DUCT TAPE!
that'll help
gonna visit California in about a week, can't wait /)^3^(\
hi
00,02hen3ry, /)
He was trying to LAND on the moon? O:
Okay..
I though he wanted to go THROUGH it
He did land on the moon, technically.
00,02Major_Frank, i allmost landed
00,02well, i allmost didnt break when landing
the legs broke off the lander, but...
00,02it didnt disintergrate
the main pod is designed to break off. Granted, that's for return, but...
00,02dis should work
00,02using the ones with thrust vectoring this time
00,02so i have SOME controll on takeoff
"some"
I dont want to look D:
it won't be enough
I make a fair amount of use over vectoring engines myself.
Looks promising..
straight as a bullet.
That's supposed to look like that right?
Yeah!
still a bit of spin to it, but that's fine.
. . .
00,02not sure how to get them out of there
yeah
00,02not realy moving here
00,02going up sure
oooh
that's interesting
00,02need the bigger rockets
Behold!
are you slowing?
can't tell from this resolution
Glad I aint on that ship...
00,02hen3ry, i'm speeding up now
00,02it wasnt slowing much
00,02sort of stabalizing
less atmosphere and gravity=higher acceleration and terminal velocity
00,02but yeah
00,02the thrust vectoring is a godsend
00,02i can controll the thing now
in layman's terms: the higher, the faster
Do a backflip!
00,02TheRandomkid321, i unno
00,02not my job
00,02well
00,02nvm
ouch
whoa.
erm... boom
Okay
*sich
*sigh*
/me Picks up telephone
it needs more cowbell
looks uneven
And I clikced on anpther ad :\
uneven burn rates tho.
I asked which couler was my favorite.
00,02should have more controll and power now
Good
00,02i forgot about fuel XD
I have 1 can of Coca-Cola left on stand-by
00,02theres gona be an uneven fuel use
00,02ah well
yup
KASA?
Okay
00,02forgot about the second set of srb's
00,02yeah
00,02srb's are still geting stuck in the center
00,02might have to remove those ones
00,02Lunar_Brony, wow
00,02actualy nvm
00,02its not tilting
00,02why ISNT it tilting
Magnets
SHould it tilt?
because you have vectoring engines
no air resistance to pull you to the side
Open a window in there
Might help
those engines can compensate for a lot of fault
Do i have to do everything here?!
I like this guys thinking
00,02:<
CRAP!
Already did
XP?
again
Didnt went acording to plan
-_(\
I might have done that
Sorry
00,02hen3ry, i didnt
ka-BOOOOOM!
usually that only happens when a bottom section detaches and proceeds to ram the upper section
I find the possible coincidance amusing
Offcourse
DAMN YOU VICTO- I mean DISCOOOOOOOR!
that can't possibly fix it.
00,02brb
strange things work sometimes
I blame the Nazis

00,02ok

I'm skeptical.
00,10is it geting bigger?

Uh uh
00,10drag chutes?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m12reofaLh1r1qdgvo1_1280.gif
no explosion, but this is a fail in itself
Huston..
he tried chutes to stop the central solids from getting trapped
at least I think that was the theory
00,02Sumica, i was trying to yank those srb's out
00,02they get stuck in the center
00,10ahh
00,02it didnt work
I feel belittled.
brb
night
mornin' bros, everythin' going good?
coffie?
I'm back
00,02hmm
Actually, it's a her.
00,02this design is not exactly ideal
only offer for download drivers on their newest parts... fuuuuuu-
00,02it can lift itself
00,02JUST
^
00,02it wouldnt be able to take of without the srb's
00,02i tend not to assume gender at all
00,02i assume you're all genderless blobs

/me is just a blob

00,02i have concluded
00,02i must construct aditional stages
aww
Oh no....
logical
00,02actually
00,02nvm
it's catchy
00,02i has srs idea

Or just any creepypasta for that matter...
Any ideas here?
i do

Yeah...
I know
ok, heres the "idea

04No, Lunar. You stay awesome.
Yeah, rap can be rather obnoxious.
Soem rap is good... SOME

00,02what do you meen
00,02oh
00,02yeah
00,02thats someone else
ouch
uneven thrusters
00,02huh
00,02left some of my boosters behind
00,02oh well
04Are you one of my fans, Poly? (reference)
at least at the base.
which is a pain
04Bah, oh well
04I was going for MGS
Dat song
Dayum
~
my way of trying to balance the landing pad, is to move the cockpit down until the engines are actually slightly underground, with the yellow just-barely peaking out from being buried, then match the others to that exact level
without a reference it's hard
04Eh, it's fine Poly
I've only played Sons of Liberty maybe ten years ago.
o__o
00,02why
00,02why does it not explode
uh... because it's a fairly decent design overall?
Yup. I still got it.
00,10what in the hay are you doing with that much fuel
rollin
00,02hmm
00,02uneven burn
that way the first-ejecting tank is constantly refueling the second tank to full, until it's totally empty
04Night Poly
Goodnight everypony.
04I don't put out on the first date, ya dig :I
00,02it didnt seperate the way i wanted to
00,02hen3ry, probably
00,02i think one didnt attach right
00,02note to self: start burns sooner
I'm out
04I don't know
:(
04I thought it would have been mid June
see ya guys
08,01yay
08,01blue contact lenses for my pinkie pie cosplay arrived today!
and hi Saturn XD
00,02well
00,02i wasted a lot of fuel
Awesome, Saturn/
Saturn awesome
WHY AM I NOT ASLEEP YET
08,01yes, i'm putting that much effort into this cosplay that i actually went to get contact lenses.
Saturn hey, me too :P
Saturn: I'd be jelly, but I already use contacts.
drat
i do hope you can get cyan lenses thoguh
00,02XD
00,02cher3ry
00,02dats the name
eh?
uh oh...
00,02gota wait untill the orbits intersect
I don't know anything about streaming...
00,02lol
00,02dat orbit
the site was apparently hammered constantly from 11 am to... whenever.
00,02Sumica, XD
00,10do you have the shuttle mod still?
lower cost, demand soars, server crashes.
00,02Sumica, probably not, i'm running stock right now
00,10ah yeah would need the coupler mod and the shuttle one.
Yay~
why did I buy a graphics tablet from a company whose webserver is apparently attached via a 56k modem? sigh.
I think it was actually a case of "oooh, that's not too expensive, maybe I'll try that..."
00,02for some reason
followed by "fuuuuuuu- i can't draw"
00,02toys, not show
00,02at 8:30 pm
00,02during the simpsons
lolwut
hmmm
ok this looks like a decent approach...
00,02dis is going well
INB4 pictures of Pinkie AND Fluttershy on a bike.
On one of those silly multi-seat bikes.
Oh.
Magic.
ow
00,02well
Allo everypony.
that... wasn't the technique.
Hey there, Meanwhile/
That went well...
00,02too fragile
00,02Meanwhile, no
00,02just stranding them on the mun
How is that moving?
gyros
although, that's clearly overpowered
00,02those tanks are mostly full too
00,02could have made it back
00,02with extreem ease
But then you fell apart.
00,02probably even made it to minmus and back
00,02infact this craft is easily capable of that
00,02but yeah
00,02boom
00,02:(
00,02should probably split before landing
at a distance of roughly 3.5 billion km from home
no
Now for something without context. http://i.imgur.com/o0qBn.jpg
those thrusters are too tall for the stock lander legs. I tried
00,02i'm gona cheat
Fair 'nuff.
00,02XD
00,02Sumica, bit much
do the pilots survive that?
00,10and is doing 4500m/s by the time it hits 60km
00,02ok
00,02attempt two
00,02i heard noise
I thought they had a maximum G force tho.
00,02huh
00,10problem is the g load must be damaging somthing or there is too much drag
00,02not sure where the stream is
00,10cause the oper sections colapses
08,01http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Higgs-Boson-Particles-/251100388854
08,01i lol'd
00,02it can work
Saturn http://www.ebuyer.com/390394-higgs-boson-higgs126
00,02Saturn, i did too XD
boomsound
27km particle accelerator sold separately
pff, I've got tons of Higgs Boson-like particles. 7297.35 seems pricy to me.
00,02A: Hello Superjordansales - I am letting the market decide. This is a premium jar after all.
My higgs bosons are part of me. They keep my bits together.
Saturn: I want to see if anyone actually buys them, though.
I shan't be parting with them.
For 7 thousand quid, I think I can spare 3 or 4.
Worst landing ever.
not the worst. At least they're within walking distance this time
I'm guessing the side-attachments are breaking
hai everypony :3
FairysHuffTest
dat boomn
Boom.
They lived?
HAI EVERYPONY :I
00,02XD
I procastinate too much, and it's apparently "killing" my studies
dat fuel line
I'm wondering if I have ADHD
lol 8 bit music ftw
And we get splosion.
00,02not sure how to make it work
might work with lander legs, just haven't tried it
mount tricouplers as low as they can go, then mount the legs (or wings) to the very bottom of those
er... side decouplers I mean.
uh... that won't work
00,02screw physics
physics isn't the problem here mate, it's the landing control.
hit G.
You can join NASA with that
wheels go up as legs go down
00,02hen3ry, watch
FairysHufftest
grrrrrrrrrr
?
00,02ok, probably cant see it on stream
Still trying to get my mIRC client to play a sound when I receive a message.
Aaaand fall.
00,02CrazyCherry, :)
gonna try sommit here
Try clicking that and going under "Highlights".
00,02its a hack
00,02but it works
And whatever else you want to ping you.
i*
See y'all later :D
Dat song timing.
00,02i sware the gyroscopes have stopped working
FairysHuffTest
Yo everypony
00,02i have no controll right now
...If it doesn't explode beforehand.
You got to the moon
I can send you a simple proof of concept
:)
KammerjunkStill no worky.
Lol
Music changing
I meant the other decoupler type
00,02this should work
That slaps me on the knee.
08,01my eyes are blue
Orly, Saturn?
Saturn: I'm blue, da dee dee da dee da.
Saturn: whered you get the contacts?
hitting on the Spice too much?
Saturn: How many pairs of lenses did you get?
success!
Looks like that *puts on glasses* didnt work YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
00,02hmmm
O.O
dem full HDs
DOWNLOAD RAM!
but this laptop sux
actually
My mouse sucks
Why are people celebrating 4th of july though :/
Because it's the 5th?
I really don't know, I don't celebrate it.
You wouldn't download a hard drive!
Whats sop good about 4th july I dont know.
Wooo moosic :3
independance?
July 4 is the Independance Day of US, I think. :3
I dont know whats a independance day is
Yes it is. Because the actual document was signed on July 1-2.
Meh
00,02Kammerjunk, good point
I drank 2 cups of hot chocolate
no wait, I got that wrong.
I need more
Oh hi, Ghostipedia.
MORE HOT CHOCOLATE
2+2=4
dang I'm getting AdBlocker+
Brb E-Ponys
And now I shall sleep for a bit because of medicationies. ^_^ Back in a couple hours.
183 + 214 = 397.
00,02its detatching them
08,01look at my beautiful blue eyes: http://ompldr.org/vZW5zNw
Saturn: How many sets of lenses did you get?
huh. That wasn't the problem I expected.
08,01Kammerjunk: 2
I tend to find lenses can grow annoying if you wear them all day, but that might just be my eyes.
Back E-Ponys
bit of a wobble but...
Boom.
(aguy:wb)
:P
08,01the lenses a bit clearer: http://ompldr.org/vZW5zYQ
08,01i'm spending faaaar too much money on it
cosplay
08,01i even got a plush alligator to attach to myself
Saturn nnnnnnnn pm me the link to where you got them from
08,01mm
08,01tasty
legs must be slightly off balance.
00,02i'ma put that aside for now
00,02code time
08,01sorry, i just ruined you day
but with that much weight, the legs have to be exact I think.
probably also another series of them at the outermost point of the triangle
08,01Kammerjunk: yum
....
wat
I just don't know the english word for pie-bread.
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, java
Hes scripting
00,02more commonly know as bad
bad java?
Dahec
00,02looking at ThreadPool.java right now
Hey, Java is alright.
...java rice. /derp
00,02DustyNomad, java sucks
Y?
I'd prefer to learn a more platform-centered language, though.
00,02DustyNomad, incredibly verbose, confusing and badly made librarys
00,02slow
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
00,02VERY ineficent with memory
I dont get it
00,02i dont think the language itself is the problem
00,02i think its programers suck
the tradeoffs they made to make it "universal" are an issue.
And yet, for some reason, Java still manages to create awesome games. :I
00,02thats the only thing in java thats worth it
00,02wish they chose a different language for android
00,02surely they could have used .net
00,02its a superclass of Thread, and does basicaly nothing but track thread creation
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, i dont see why that makes it dangerous
Open source is everybody's business.
00,02DustyNomad, odd, i can do all those things on my phone
you know like a ipad
00,02DustyNomad, yes. an android tablet
Yea
00,02the only real difference is the ui
...That, and it's not Apple.
Actually there are types
Piece of shit.
GIVE ME A AXE
DAMMIT
SURE
Lol
Its a piece of shit
I have never used Reddit.
apparently I'm getting a hand-me-down iPad this month. Never used an iPad before.
00,02what i want to do is catch exceptions and post them somewhere
00,02getting all sorts of strange behaviour and cant reproduce some of it
Ok you can delte history but you cant delete pictures.
Scribblenauts Remix is pretty much one of the few best games on an iOS.
00,02DustyNomad, it realy needs a proper file manager, theres none intergrated into android but esFileManager is fairly good
Kbsi
00,02Kammerjunk, depends, if i enjoy my job then no
Kbai E-pony
00,02given that i could never have a job i dont enjoy, i'd do it
00,02hen3ry, that
00,02wow
00,02hen3ry, that is scary
yes, it is.
00,02hen3ry, thats evil, NEVER do that
00,02wait
TooManyItems is way too useful.
00,02dafaq
Tekkit*
I dunno,it's just more enjoyable than Creative mode.
ALL the innuendos!
00,02this code
00,02the crap
00,02i dont see how this works
harvest moon was awesome
lol agreed
Also, "I can scare the shit out of my neighbour in 10 seconds flat."
doesn't it have to launch client-side most of those threads?
at least the UI
00,02i dont even
yeah...
00,02every now and again
00,02i look at this code
create an array of threadpools of the minimum of the maximum of... magic.
00,02see breif flashes of logic
Oh hey, I only have 110 tabs open!
00,02then i look closer and see more crap
00,02:'(
I used to have like, 150.
00,02hen3ry, 'shi-chan'
00,02its a decompile of the paintchat
huh. Never trust code from a -chan. Insist on at least a -kun, preferably a -san.
00,02figured it'd be ok sense shi-chan has more or less not existed sense 2003
00,02XD
I just can't.
00,02it could be worse
00,02we could be looking at M.java
Fair 'nuff.
I'm still trying to conceptualize it based on how I'd write it if I had to.
server side holds the "chat" and the "canvas," and everything else is client side, I'd guess.
bitshifting.
... fuck it, we'll do it live.
00,02lets not forget the abuse of the ? opperator
00,023.8k lines of obfuscated java
yeah. I'm guessing all of those have to do with the canvas part, but still, that's... that's not code, that's a code's abortion.
dat code wall
00,02hen3ry, plus theres unused variables and functions in the code
This coding is scary.
00,02which meens the compiler didnt optimize them out
of course there's unused variables and functions, the programmer couldn't have possibly kept track of them all
00,02yeah, but they should be optimized away
I'm not sure about that, but shi-chan may well have been stoned
00,02tool = (ToolBox)Class.forName("paintchat." + s2 + ".Tools").newInstance();
yup
00,02hen3ry, yeah, been thinking of that
also, fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-.
00,02stream working?
yeah streams up
00,02only on the second set of tanks
http://i48.tinypic.com/34qtemx.png
best photoshop ever
Seen supirior photoshop
Not many people talkin.... Kinda eerie...
yeah a bit
00,02well
00,02i screwed this up
http://lolmls.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/LOLMLS_073.jpg
Oh this is bad
00,02t
Serioulsy though... WHere is everyone? There where heaps on a couple of hours ago.
oh?
Well I would work on my creepypasta but I have van't concetrate with this in the BG. And I don't wish to leave.
huzzah the input devices have been doubled!
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, sure
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90WznJlh3Ew&feature=related
I am aprroximatly 8-10 seconds behind.
08,01hahaha
08,01i just had the best idea
08,01for taking my cosplay even further
thats normal, we're always a little behind the actual stream
08,01so i smell like a bakery!
just a teaspoon
08,01behind each eaer
08,01*ear
Saturn: wut
Saturn is cosplaying as Pinkie Pie.
08,01Spell-of-Gaming: pinkie pie cosplay
08,01it's going to be EPIC
00,02XD
hello every one
cosplay where?
how are you all
08,01TheRandomkid321: male
Saturn Okay
08,01brony uk convention
/me disengages Lurkmode.
I meant straned on the MOON!
Le Mooo
08,01hmm
08,01okay, i need to find an odourless deoderant
oh hello saturn
08,01wrek: i'm totally maxing out my pinkie pie cosplay
08,01i got blue contact lenses
Saturn: That should be awesome
08,01that's a good point
08,01though, actually
/me 08,01just remembered that his leave in conditioner smells of jojoba
08,01of dried fruit and flowers
Bye guys.... I may be on later
00,02hmm
00,02theres something on the moon
00,02i might go have a look at it when i manage a lunar rovar
00,02rover'
supposedly an "arch" there.
00,02two minutes till perapsis
00,02hen3ry, that too
00,02:D
you might not have an actual perapsis... I've landed at altitudes that high.
That would be awesome
00,02dis is a little close
00,022.8k
00,02i think thats a mountoune therei
00,02shit
00,02well
00,02nvm then
00,02once more with tri
00,02or program
00,02hmmm
00,02who's still here?
yo
Comic
00,02hen3ry, its hard
00,02i've managed a few landings
it looks hard.
00,02though i think its the controlls more than anything
I'm pretty sure my way is easier, even if it does burn way more fuel and take a long time.
00,02absolute pain
00,02cow334, k
whohoo
Lawl
00,02tri is my favorite design
00,02bout the same as quad, but two instead of three outer boosters
00,02i meen 4
00,02two instead of four
00,02stupid orbit
00,02i sware the rockets got less powerfull
00,02ders the intercept
Dat Higgs Boson
00,02cow334, i'd rather try land
00,02probably gona hit the moon anyway

hi
i found some neat trixie pics for you
although you may have already seen them
00,02like an arrow
00,02hen3ry, about to try land
that looks more like one of my typical approaches. 16km up and zero momentum except on the z axis
00,02XD
:D
I just want to point out that there should be no immediate explosions
:D
oops
00,02GODDAMNIT
backflip!
XD
00,02why you break on me
:(
00,02i sware this has changed

howd that happen?
00,02and lost my engine
00,02i have no clue

well that's embarassing. Got it into lunar orbit but because of a couple burn errors, ended up out of fuel.
good thing we got plenty more
actually my kerbals have a decent survival rate... if the launchpad doesn't get em, they usually land safely

Saturn: S'all good.
Saturn: are you busy? ;)

Alright, I'll wait then ;)

sorry ^_^
00,02thing is uncaught exceptions normaly kill the vm
Saturn have you ever heard of going too far?
keep up the good work
00,02which is excelent, but it wont let you compile if that scenario is detected
how was everypony's 4th of july? (if you're in the US :u)
terrific
in that case its actually the java compiler that detects uncaught checked exceptions
I was like "FAP!"
oops

08,01okay, i think i've got the proportions right

HIYA EVERYPONY
08,01and i don't want that
Saturn: use maple syrup instead dB
Saturn: egg would be somewhat okay, being a bakery and all...

08,01and spray it in as my hair dries
08,01actually, no

hey guys
00,02uncaught exceptions are not being caught by the uncaught exception handler
00,02theres reasons i hate java
00,02User0, this is code i've just added
hi everypony!
hey look, paintchat works dB bye
Oh you guys... http://i.imgur.com/wfG7I.jpg

http://johnjoseco.deviantart.com/art/This-is-Comfy-294185783?q=boost%3Apopular%20johnjoseco&qo=94
00,02why cant i catch this exception
http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=johnjoseco&offset=96#/d45v19j ogod, wet maned twilight and celestia
00,02^
oops gtg
be back on at lunchtime
00,02shana, i'm using setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler
00,02explicitly trying to catch uncaught ones
00,02User0, but java has no pointers
00,02only refferences
java has pointers...
precautions*
00,02shana, it doesnt have pointers
its a reference to how there is nothing there
00,02Chrysalis, yeah, but its not a pointer
yes it is
00,02references != pointers
in java everything is on the heap
00,02there is a pointer somewhere
00,02i dont contest that
just hidden
00,02not in the language
all the tableflipping
00,02Chrysalis, you could impliment it as an array index
00,02there doesnt need to be a pointer
00,02besides, you cant defer them
all that changes is the syntax
I'm writing some code for work right now and I have 11 errors and 578 warning...
00,02i cant say access 0x10 in memory
at assembly level a reference and a pointer are exactly the same
00,02Chrysalis, no they are not
00,02a reference is conceptual, it exists at the language and vm level
http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=johnjoseco&offset=312#/d47gvj6
/me goes to check is java references are different from the C++ references
cause in c++ they are definately the same
00,02c++ has pointers
and c#/java everything is on the heap, and you have to use pointers for those
00,02and c# has a stack
00,02makes it a crapton faster than java
http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/141834/how-is-a-java-reference-different-from-a-c-pointer
00,02shana, the default handler is for the entire vm
a java reference is a pointer but with compiler enforced type checking
same as c++ references
00,02shana, http://derpy.me/X0G71
00,02outcast looks old old
http://browse.deviantart.com/?order=9&q=johnjoseco&offset=432#/d496t69
00,02but very polished for its time
00,02infact i'd gues this is 2002 by the design
00,02at least 2002
00,02shana, ok, whats it do?
00,02"This handler is invoked in case any Thread dies due to an unhandled exception."
00,02shana, its a static function
00,02interesting
00,02doing'
00,02this uses ThreadGroup instead of Thread
why is stream about statics?
dat JJ
00,02shana, you sure static can be thread local?
00,02google is telling me otherwise
00,02http://codingclues.eu/2008/catching-exceptions-with-an-uncaughtexceptionhandler-in-java/
00,02everything i'm seeing says this is suposed to be global
00,02then why isnt it being invoked
00,02shana, subclass of Thread
00,02nope
00,02oh

Seriously?
They're atually making a Mass Effect film?
Oh, I thought it was the stargate movie from the look of it.
I just saw the pyramid when I came in.
wat
scientists
They were making a Stargate MMO but the games company went under.
or in english
also, they use this in atlantis
That all makes sense to me. Relatively simple.
only SGC has gate travel
due to their use of an independant system

00,10lol which dont even work on this network
00,10it dont stop the wormhole
00,10it stops people from coming out the wormhole
Yeah I know, but if the gate works like it does in the movie, it shouldn't kill them either.
ഃ
Since there's this watery like waiting room kind of thing.
it stops all matter from materialising
00,10oh the matter materialises.
oh yeah, it doesnt stopit materialising, it stops reintegration
/me has been trout-ed.
Mind = Blown
Sure you can
also, it would be impossible
you need to be in orbit or on a planet for the gates to connect
Hello
and 2 gates cannot maintain a connection in orbit around the same plane
one overrides the other
00,10that was one bit they never covered.
Then send one to the other while keeping the connection open
and they lose connection once they leave orbit
Bullshit
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/835/
00,10no i meen if the gate is open already
they can't
00,10I thought it was a gate that was opening
they gave it a proper name
How about we take all of these problems, and given them to Pinkie pie...
00,10he was playing with the gun when it happend
I think the official name for it is Gawoosh

they dont cover that for a couple seasons do they

How shit are their computers?
00,10apple IIE
Lawl
not easy shit
Also, this show is from year 2000.
Seriously
Get Bill Gates!
moooooop
The way she described it
It should take seconds
To us now, these are 10 year old computers.
00,10altho 2-3 a month would be around one a week
and align them to pre-existing systems (which are also moving) to get a target
They know how far away the planets move each year
50,000 * distance
Simple shit
Look at the laptop computer there.
Yeah really
00,10good memory
as the gravtiy from each system affects the overall movement
dear calesta, please send the aliens to the moon,
Yes, but you don't need the exact locations
Just a good approximate
00,10the metal in the gate amplifies the effect of a nuke
The way she said they were going to do it, it would take seconds
THat's a fact
00,10you get close it connects, it dont then you get busy signal
but all nerds do that
cern only just found the higgs partical
Unless she was dumbing it down for the benefit of O'Neal.
