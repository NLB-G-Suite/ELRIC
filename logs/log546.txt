Looked llike a light in the darkness of shitty CoD games
still does :'(
Like you wouldn't do it
Except BO2 that looks good
Ghost30k: well..tf2
I've only seen one part of Plague Dogs.
And it's insanely depressing
Bronysith: But that games been out for years
so any pony excite for X-COM enemy unkown by firaxis?
Ghost30k: yes. but it is fantastic still and doesnt need constant sequels
Quick_Thinker: oh yes :)
Some hunter finds one of the dogs and it's all happy
/me smiles, "Sorry, been rough...but I promise, if youbor any other pony is in trouble...ill be there to help...."
other then of course der riese
True fact there
build a resort on top of a mountain for a guy afraid of hights wat?
The he climbs in his hands and bumps his rifle
which actully did excist
and it blows off the guys face.
...Shit was terrifying
nice color scheme hitler. You have the visionary coloration of dog.
:D
der riese was used to hide a rumored experimentel projects like Die Glocke
>Find dead body
>Take gun
"Back home huh? Where did you live before you came here?"
> sell it on Ebay
Fallout 3 all over again
nice view
must haz pistol!
Take Hilter's home, get drunk. I can agree.
it looks beatuiful
Look at that view.
stand fast solider
...I wonder where Hitler's gun is now
Barbetos: Hell I'd wanna do that everyday just to spite Hitler
who knows
VACATION IN THE EAGLES NEST
V-day.
Maybe the Smithsonian?
11,01VE day.
wait where is hitler buired?
the thought never occured to me
Im sorry :I
11,01We were still at war with Japan.
^
Nittany_Discord: what a day :)
Quick_Thinker: he isnt.
Ghost30k I guess I am spiting Hitler right now. XD
Quick_Thinker. Nopony knows, the Russians took him
((Hey Coruscate ))
huh
/me quickly hammers the soft metal into shape, flattening and pressing the shoe over the anvil. "Well... I come from a canine country across the ocean, it's called Oilana."
/me nods and smiles a little relieved "Oh that's good then."
wow........
BOOZE
whats making him surprised can someone tell me oh that
wow
Holy crap
woah
just...woah
Hitler killed his dog before his died
Sweet celestia.........
IM GONNA GET DRUNK OFF THIS #$%#
wwwwwwwwwwwwooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwww
this must be Kim Jong Il's bunker
O_O Holy cow that's alot of wine - more than one could drink in a lifetime
StinkomanFan: okay, that is also bucked up.
Because he feared what they'd do to his dog
Don't tell Berry Punch >_>
I took Berry Punch to a Winery once
man thats a whole lot of cider *WINK WINK* *NUDGE NUDGE* *HINT HINT*
StinkomanFan: and maybe he had every reason to do so.
11,01I took Winery to a berry punch once.
She was like a waterbed when she came too
How did that go, StinkomanFan :)
:D Nice
soldiers useing skis to fight sounds fucking epic
/me nods, "Yea, im a good one I still think..."
Quick_Thinker: saynomore saynomore?
silly soldiers what about Japan?
You know one thing I'd never do?
what?
I wouldn't fight a doctor
win a war, get b*tches
Guten Toch, Ladies
StinkomanFan: why?
Cypresswolf: I thought it was Guten Tag?
War maybe hell, but it can have rewards
Doctors know more ways to kill a man than most assassins
StinkomanFan: eeyup
:) it probably is, otakon1
"A Canine country...?"
/me blinks
Stinkoman: medical? or else what if gordon freeman got up in your stuff?
adasdad, Medical
/me looks up from his work. "Something wrong, Mirage?"
:D
this must had been awkward as hell
Dark92Enigma: ikr?
Most people would use a brick on the skull
A doctor would hit you in the neck and watch you choke on your blood
pacific war was more terrible than europeon = /
In self-defense, naturally
"You said Canine right? As in... dogs?"
/me "Think, or know?"
StinkomanFan: glass marble, shoved in mans, you know, hole and smacked with a hammer. they bleed to death through there
points huh ? the army had a point system?
StinkomanFan: i forget where i heard this but it disturbs me
:D
"That's right, dogs." He smiles as he strikes the steel, looking up to Mirage between hits
/me adasdad House: ''Do i hit him again?''
"I didn't think dogs would be able to have their own country..."
poor deer
DEER!
Doctors man. You do NOT FUCK WITH MEDICS
AIM FOR THE HEART!
FOR THE HEART!
/me cocks his head. "Huh?"
Lol
FOR THE HART!

((Hi Berry and Crimson ))
"I didn't think dogs could be that intelligent to have their own country."
(( heya ))
no one got the joke
Hey Nelaj )
Dark92Enigma: "I just found him here, lying on the floor with a bump on his head. pretty sure it's lupis."
lol lottery
/me raises his brow. He pauses his hammering for a moment. "Couldn't be..." He cocks his head and chuckles, returning to his owrk. "What would make you think that?"
HOORAY
adasdad ''And i solved the case!''
"Think."
YAAAAY
wat movie is this?
thats gotta suck
ChronoClutch: Band of Brothers and its a television series not a movie bro /)

Shouldn't that statement ended in again?
I remember this one story about this Vietnam soldier who stole another guy's army tags and pretended to be a medic
i heard
I BEAT THE MLP FIM theme on HARD on Step Mania YEAH :)

/me gets up and sits next to him curious "Why?"
He did medicinal work for years without even going to medical school
11,01Yay Quick_Thinker
u have achieved life
thanks discord

And the only reason he was caught was because when he went home the guy's wife didn't recognize him
/me sighs, "just....stuff... I want to be good...have the right intention ....but I screwed up."
and killed
goddammit
Wow..
/me "How?"
anyway, I'm off to bed
.. Of all the things to get some one, it has to be a drunken bastard after a war ends... sorta

/me scratches his belly as he props himself up on a table. "What creatures? They're sort of like gnolls if you've ever seen one..."

im back:)
oh hello appledash6
Way to help medic...
/me sets his head down, "I was forced too. Look kid, I don't want to talk about this. Just know that i didnt want too."
i know a short cut yah?
and then he gets the shit beat out of him
Shamroc: Dam right >:3 You shoot one of your own you get your flank beat.
/me frowns "Oh...Sorry for budding into places I shouldn't. I...I'm usually cheery you know."
Spears.
dayum
"Hm." He takes off his cap and puts it on the table, rubbing at his shaved mane. "I don't know too much, so I never heard of humans. Gnolls though, nasty folk. Walking hyenas, wanna..." He shakes his head. "Bad things." He shrugs off his apron. "But yeah, canines are very familiar to me. I'm sure there's at least one in Equestria."
/me dances
Finish him....
DeathStar: honestly the worst time dear...

Your not worth the damn ammo....
"I wouldn

100+ Paragon points
Shamroc: oops...
DeathStar: <3
Death would of been too good for that guy,
/me sighs, "I am...or, was too...."
He gave him a worse fate.
Is it alright if we cut off around 2? I can go on, but I don't want to sleep all day, ya know?)
/me ask Deathstar to site down and not dance during scenes like this
Someone's getting the shit beat out of them, I think
AttackPony: He shot one of his own in the head nearly killing him in a drunken fit.
Liokin: Mmm.
my streams not working so I didn't know :(
AttackPony: So they beat the breaks off of him.
/me winces at the impact
oh sorryt then :$
/me "Oh..."
DeathStar...you can dance when the shows over dear
it's okay DeathStar
Shamroc: okey ^^
Yeah I have to get to bed soon too. )
DeathStar: Its ok deathstar ^-^ you were just doing what you do no harm in that :3
Liokin: I couldn't do it. I don't have the heart or the mentality to od it
We can finish the conversation and leave or put it on pause )
TheGreatAndPowerfulT....hmm
Shamroc what ? :p
not sure
/me shrugs "Don't let me get you down though....just ....just stick to white magic. Hurting ponies is no fun..."
Pausin sounds coo)
Im off to bed - Thanks for the stream - Goodnight Everypony
Night, cyber_pony13
Night cyp--aand he's gone

AttackPony: After seeing the camp I would have gone completely hollow inside. But Barbetos was right death is too good for him. Plus the guy he shot survived. So the ass whoopen willl have to suffice.
Morning, Canadian_Brony

Canadian_Brony: It's a good history film. It also teaches a few life lessons...heh.

Canadian_Brony: Ahh, a conasouer of history. That was a good film as well. the weapons were much more rustic though so casualty was about as common as a cold.

/me nods and rubs the back of his neck. "Thanks. Just in a day's work, really."
/me eyes Crescent quietly, sitting patiently and calmly in Flarias grasp
this is where we got our national anthem
Canadian_Brony: wow what a twist on the title who made it M knight? -lol
appledash6 the reason I never hear about it is because the first openly admitting brony in my school is a badass

holy buck scientist DISCOVERED THE GOD PARTICLE WHAT
-_(\
:(
11,01Supposedly.
:$
FLUTTERSHY IS NUMBER 1 IN MY BOOK
11,01They need to go find the graviton.
it will take years of research to confirm
true that
done
Nittany_Discord if it's even possible. It's all just in theory, remember.
11,01Gravitons aren't actually part of the standard model.
whens season 3
Theoretical Science is too theoretical for me
fudge
whens season 3
well if they can find that then we can have ALTERNATE DIMENSION OPENED UP YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
11,01I've been out of science too long.
TheKoreanBrony1354 around the time i start school again. September-ish
11,01I want to get back in.
oh
There's that word. I don't think people know what "theory" is intended to mean.
first things first scientist find Equestria it exist as does a fallout dimension
Wait i cant wait that long without seeing fluttershy:(
CK|Basara Theoretical Science is too theoretical for me. I'm more interested in factual science
cold, hard facts
11,01Theory: Unproven scientific fact.
So you don't believe in gravity, then.
twilight knows alot of science
Then download desktop ponies and spawn Fluttershy or get a fluttershy wallpaper
11,01A proven scientific fact is a law.
( this is my 1st time playing mother 3) oh wow! the mom dies already >_> just as fast as mia died in phoenix wright 6_9
Because gravity is just a theory.
YOUR RIGHT
:P
MY LITTEL PONY IS MY IPOD WALLPAPER
11,01There are laws of gravity.
in fact eveything at any moment has a alternate unverse where things happen for instance in this one i eat some food (in another dimension i may not and it goes off from there)
11,01Or a law.
There are laws within gravity.
Nittany_Discord therefore, it is a law for me to never admit into sanity or I will lose it.
. . . I think I just made a paradox . . .
But the concept of gravity is a theory, in the proper sense of the word, meaning "it's EXTREMELY likely to be true but cannot be 100% verified".
CAN U LIKE SIGN UP FOR BRONYSTATE
Rather than what people SEEM to think "theory" means, that being "it's just a guess"

Ah, here's the bit I was looking for.
"Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative."
11,01But laws trump theory.
11,01Scientific laws.
11,01Laws of motion. Laws of thermodynamics.
can we get pony music please?
or at least some happier tunes?
WITH EVERY action there a reaction
I have theories but not really scientific just Philosophical (I pretty much have a philosophical point of view in life)
11,01Don't start telling the streamer what to stream.
for instance im typing that typing goes to this chat
Laws are simply statements of behavior within certain parameters. Many of those laws operate within theories.
does everyone here beleive in god i do
i dont
not science
nope
i belvie in science
Yes I believe in God
inb4 *ponies*
i believe in ponies
lol
dmni
t
as well as ponies
same bronyism
11,01I do, but let's not start a religious discussion.
Also Ponies
bronyism
muhahaahah
Quick_Thinker: You really muct be a quick thinker if you don't stop to think about telling the stream what to do
The laws of gravity all operate within the overall theory of gravity, that doesn't mean the laws overrule the theory because they only are true IF the theory of gravity itself is accurate. So laws and theories operate with each other, they're not a strict hierarchy. :P
derp a derp
so do streamers ever stream episodes of mlp fim? or is there a place for that???
If ou are interested look up the hollow planet theory
gtg
bye evry pony
ChronoClutch yes, during Movie Night
Bye
g'night TheKoreanBrony1354
yeah dismo i just was feeling a bit blue by the music but thats not a good excuse
I am a Canadian 2
ChronoClutch /)
Ontario is where I am eeyup
11,01We stream ponies. Just not always.
Northwestern BC
heard its nice up there
Anyways, sorry, but that misuse of "theory" always makes me twitch. XP
11,01It's way late here. I'm going to bed.
It's 1:28 am here. Should I sleep or should I stay?
Amerucan :D
ChronoClutch not currently. Rain, rain, clouds, and more rain. Percipitation, not the Brony
Let's see. Just three more playthroughs and I'll have unlocked Oda Nobunaga. Just....three more. ;_;
in what game?
Canadian_Brony: I love rain :P
>_>
yeah sorry for the whole telling what the streamer to do its my fault and i derped
ChronoClutch rain can be good, but cloud cover is annoying
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Sengoku Basara 3. Damn game is gonna take me forever to 100%. ._.
grey skies all week long
Canadian_Brony: I have an interest in depressing tones
man is Step mania At the gala 20% cooler tough still cant get past twi's part
Oh, my bad.
so cloud cover and stuff I like a lot more than sunny days
I thought we had music playing, my mistake,
But I suppose a bunch of screaming Orcs is fine.
ChronoClutch everyone has their own tastes. The best thing I can name about Cloud Cover is an excuse not to do yardwork
lol
Good *looks at clock* um morning everypony I going to take a 10 hr nap see you all then. :)
evening Dovah
Dovah: adios :P
have a nice nap
has anyone played the Rythm Thief demo? man its fun :)
wats dat???
Sketch_Toku_Brony sounds fun. What is it?
oh god
i youtubed it
not for me :)
ChronoClutch what type of game is it?
I do not play those types of games they irritate me: WOW LOL etc
like a ddr i looked like
ya a lot of ppl dont realize this but LOL causes more anger then fun
i have a bunch of friends i play with
who can only have fun when they win
I play TF2 alot
i used to play fps and tps all the time
i lost interest eventually kind of like for LOL
i only play league cuz my friends play and I am a ringer
man still can't get past Twi's part in the Step Mania at the Gala 20% cooler
its this rythm based game coming to 3ds about this Thief named R (i think thats his name) and his dog Fondue trying to find this treasure left behind by R's father which leads to this conflict w/ a man claiming to be Napeolion resurrected,im totally gonna get it :)
Canadian_Brony: When I first started I played ever chance I got now I just l;ay back and play when I feal like it :)
*lay
*feel :P
ChronoClutch I used to be terrible at shooters in general. I started playing TF2 online and CoD with a friend, and I got a *yay*- load better
the demo is out now if ya wanna check it out along with KH 3D's demo as well
Canadian_Brony: i used to play halo 3 competively on the mlg circuit back when it was popular along with Rainbow Six Vegas 2
13i wasn't sleeping.. no..
FlareChaser Buck YEAH! :D
man i had a full wining bar and soon as i got to Twi's part it went POOF
and lost BUT I WILL NEVER GIVE UP HAVE AT YOU SONG
ChronoClutch I don't own a 360, and the last time I played Halo was Griffball on Reach
hehe, Griffball . . .
grifball is fun :P
I want to grow my hair out so i can headbang to music :D
Shizuka: well of course you werent
Lightning-Quill: my hair curls so I couldn't ever :(
gosh so silly
short hair for life
ChronoClutch I developed a good strategy. If a friendly is Griff, you can hit him in the back with a Gravity Hammer to send him flying half-way across the map
I used to have shoulder length hair but it slightly curls at the end
Lightning-Quill I got a haircut recently. She really thinned out my hair, so I can't headbang anymore
13no you're drunk, i don't have a problem oshifer..
Shizuka: never had a beer in my life...i think you need to sit down
I'm sorry to hear that. Good thing hair grows back
Lightning-Quill my hair was almost that long, but not quite
I should shave soon, to
*toio
**too
-_(\
13that laughing out loud on stream
eheheh i have long enoguh have so i decided to color it Twi's color and people liked it XD
BAAABAAAAAAAAABAAAAAABAAAAAABABA
shizu drinking cider again ?
13*hic*
I like my natural Dirty Blonde hair
I let my "beard" grow out during the summer. I don't really give a buck. Then school hits then I sort of care
in fact it's still colored like this
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: thats a yes..
and i have no regrets
it's non alcoholic cider ....
13don't believe anything he says
13HE WEARS CURLERS TO BED
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: GASP YOU DO! THATS JUST CREEPY
GUYS
SHOULD YOU BE BUYING STOCKS RIGHT NOW?
Shizuka talkin about shamrocs ?
brb
13i am not sure anymore..
Dirty Blonde hair is cool to have. Mine changes colour depending on the light and if it's wet
stocks?
Dismo calm down bro :p
also, I think I was playing tf2 with you earlier
I got dem brown hairs :)
Rain: You must have missed the Ad. :c
shizu needs to go to sleep
Dismo I steer well clear of the Stock Market
back :)_
you were a spy that got my spying thwarted
I've wanted to dye my hair but I don't like how colors turn out because I saw them on other people and fadeing happens
Rain: My nick would have been "Beyond"
Dismo, I have ad blocker
I dont have to sit through that stuffs
Rain: It was ON stream.
mrrrr
i am debating dyeing my hair black
Like, ON the streamers screen.
huh well i guess i got lucky mine only fades when i buck it up
oh well then my stream must have cut out when it happened
i agree with TheGreatAndPowerfulT.......
um no its still going
there's an ad?
I don't see no ad
Shizu....dear i think its time to go to sleep..
so quiet and boring today
It was there when he shcnaged the song
if i was to get a tatoo
wat should it be of?
Rain....shizu got drunk off non-alcohlic cider again.....
Bye guys :)

Ohai Caramel :P
If I had a Cutie Mark, it would be a roll of duct tape
Caramel haven't found your special talent/wat makes you happy? Me neither :P
i think mine would be (realizes that playing video games isnt a a talent but studying them to be a video game maker is)
jk, I don't actually use Duct Tape much
got that log or still reading
yay desktopponie conga line
video games make me happy
Caramel now you do :p i didn't know so i added the trident :3 i'll keep that in mynd for the next time
Shizuka...are you ok?
i have many ideas for games buzizng in my head thats why develpoers play ton of games ot learns whats fun and whats not
what would a Cutie Mark look like if your special talent would be learning to adapt in life's hardships?
any ideas?
a clover
maybe
No stream? LET THE VIDEO LINKING BEGIN! :D
A ditto
Shizuka: Kamishima!! >:C
yes let it

0,14off to bed, later dudes and dudettes

Shamroc Tom is a rock
DISH WASHET
TheGreatAndPowerfulT..well then there you go

sounds dumb but it may be possible
That would be epic

13believe me, he complains about everything about the community
/me shrugs
ehh can't keep everyone happy :p
Shizuka...question...why is he here then? if he dislikes the majority of the community...why is he part of it?
hopefully, the final product won't need water
no sense in being a part of somthing that you hate
^maybe try my link I think it is danceable
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8 MAN IM EVIL
ha
13you got me..
i seen that
so in away, dishes can be cleaned with wubs
13he wants to know where you got his OC trixie
creepypasta is how i discovered mlp fim btw
cupcakes
nough said
Hmm?
13[1:59:09 AM] Val: someone took the time to do without asking me
should have asked directly to me :p and i took that time
ChronoClutch I could barely read "Rainbow Factory". I will never, EVER, read Cupcakes
I owe my friend he's the reason I'm a Brony
http://twentypercentcooler.net/forum/show/3797?page=4
13well ja he knows it was you that drew it
/me will most likely read "Cupcakes" eventually anyway
i has everyone OC's
OwO
there r fan made videos
i watched them
i just heard fox say something about and thought WELL FOX IS ALWAYS WRONG SO MLP FIM LETS CHECK DIS SHIT OUT (the first episode i saw was lesson zero and i got hooked on Twi from the start i have had mental breakdown in school realate things NOT FUN
huh didnt realize i made a wall XD
i ask first for a reason if he had told me he didn't want it i would haven't draw it
but he did not respond me
the first episode I watched was, well, the first episode. I remember the day so vividly
Confound these ponies all over my screen
so yeah i keep on drawing
The episode starts. The animation is good, VA was great, and then the title starts up
nope
yeah they get annoying some times trying to stop them all (i had 144 on screen once it was a nightmare)
I only have 23
I scream, pause the vid, turn around and run directly into my closed office door.
why did you scream?
13<3
^
wait Shizuka did you steal one of my hobo hearts?
I NEED THOSE
13i have these lying around
.....im watching you....and counting my hobos
my grip onto sanity is so strong and yet I wish I could let it go
actually the inly oc i don't have is rainbrodash
13do not count your hobos before they hatch
Honestly I related to Twilight the first episode but of course boy version
yeah as well as me
Quick_Thinker because I when the opening started, I didn't want to believe I was watching a show my 6-year-old sister watches. I believed I was sane up until then
13that is how the saying goes ja?
what do hobos hatch into?
13i am not sure...
13train conductors?
ah and annual idiots night has begun
I then down half a can of Coca-Cola to calm my nerves
....depends on what kind of hobo i guess
I am related to Pinkie Pie when she was a filly b4 her cutie mark
it is now just after midnight on the west coast, and some moron is firing off what I assume to be a pistol.
. . . I'm an idiot
oh oh i has a bottle of coke in the frigde...not canned BOTTLE
its awesome havnt had a bottle of coke in forevs
I never care
It's 2:05 AM here in the Midwest :)
I just tried to drink Coca-Cola from an un-opened can
I do what I want
12:05am here
3:06 am
sup?
and im 16 and like it and had a firm grip on sanity but i didnt resist i loved it the first character i saw twi from the first word she said i thought well damn thats a pony version of me but a female
That's not idiocy, Canadian_Brony, that's just absentmindedness. We all do things like that from time to time
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs-RQk86drw&feature=autoplay&list=PLB27079BB81FD3C9E&playnext=1&shuffle=977712

Oh, and it is midnight, so...
any body want to syc this one with me so we can comment on it?

The funny thing is I'm a book worm. In 7&*th grade read over 200 books

ohai
i think i'll choose the next mod tomorrow must wake up early and go to the gym.....
isnt that Rainbow dash presents captain hook the biker gorilla ?
cher3ry I refer to it as "me almost believing I'm sane, and then my brain says otherwise"
Goodnight :3
13nacht trixie
well lighting i was reading complex books before mother fucking pre school
Like I said, it's not lack of sanity, it's just absentmindedness.
Rainbow Factory . . .
night night TheGreatAndPowerfulT...take those culers out of your mane dude
/me shudders
i understood the words and even used them many times
13we are discussing lack of sanity?
curlers*
lack of sanity would be _realizing_ the can is unopened, and proceeding to try to drink from it
13silly shamrocs i meant you :3
WUT
Shizuka yes. Yes we are. I tried to drink Coca-Cola from an unopened can
.....yeah my hair is long enough to put curlers in to...
13oh
i dont enjoy having it cut
13that kind of lack of sanity
eeyup

Did somepony say SANITY? *Eye twitchs*
THIS IS A PONY CHAT GOOD SIR NO CATS! unless its opal
you need to do that about 84 zillion more times to level up to being an axe murderer.
g'night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
13:3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3 :3
even then....meh
AHHH CATS
SO MANU CATS
13nya

this is now needed
I don't know if I am too sane or insane *shrugs*
amiright?
Sanity SANITY!! this is BronyState!!
DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED EMPTEH CHAT
ok i dont mean to offend anyone but does any one hear have a form of autism (i have aspurgers just wondering)
Canadian_Brony: could you, truly?
13shizunip?
ChronoClutch nobody here is sane
if you could, then yeah, I'd grant you lunatic status
oh god no..
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results , like voting.
I think I am sane :P
i dont have any...
go away
/me hides bags of shizunip
13i sense it~
yep too sane
Quick_Thinker I do
cher3ry I couldn't do it if my life depended on it. There is no point to life if you have to take it away from others
ChronoClutch: you do realize that by the recipricol theory of sanity that makes you crazy
nope no shizunip here
I'm stable I wouldn't say Sane
rain will you mind of i ask what kind you have?
wait wat?
Canadian_Brony: exactly my point, you can't do it, therefore you're not crazy-insane.
Aspergers
ahhh
so we are alike in a way
I'm sane don't worry *ear twitchs* Yep totally sane *eye twitchs* eeeyup *Smiles Lesson Zero Twilight style with eyes depred*
cher3ry yeah, that makes sense
......woo they are talking about mental desasiaues
i has adhd and add....
havnt really noticed either for a long period of time
so what do you like the most rain my favorite things besides ponys oobviously is Science and Video games
/me puts up a wall between himself and Ponies47
is it bad that i feel a joy being definably insane
wait . . .
The only thing that kept me sane was writing in my journal and I have lost it somewhere
low level crazy is ok and harmless.
and ponies47 is going insane.... shizu throw a fruit at him
Quick_Thinker, use punctuation so I know what the heck you just said, please. @_____@
um what do you like?
that good
I like trains.
that way he will attack you and not me
not a good time C brony
What's wrong Canadian_Brony don't you LIKE ME! :[ hehahahahaha *Smiles agian Lesson Zero Twilight style with eyes derped*
13rain rain~<3
Ponies47: don't make me use the Prozac gun on you again. :D
um ponies47 have you experinced mental breakdowns they are not like that just saying (i have had quite a few and even got a chance to record one damn do you snap)
cher3ry: What are you talking about? *Eye twitchs* UI'm fine *Other eye twitchs*
/me throws a bunch of fruit at Ponies47
Ponies47 . . . I don't know how to respond to that. How about I drop this conversation right now before I say or do something that I will regret
/me then flees
k?
Shamroc can you throw some fruit at me too? I'm hungry
and I don't eat cans of Coca-Cola
first one was when i thoguht i might fail the class and everyone laugh next min i knew i was sitting in the princapls office about to be expeled
Quick_Thinker: I have may have had a couple when my parents we're getting devorced :S
well, I like Physics, Psychology, Shizu, Math, being steathy, and being agile
/me Sniffs the fruit
/me Jumps back
Man I'm being pretty entertained right now.
FRUIT! :O
Lightning-Quill join the club
/me practices quite a bit on those last two
Canadian_Brony...you dont realise...ponies47 doesnt like fruit.....and it makes him more crazed....so have fun with him while i run
there's a difference between temporary, justified snapping and real crazy, too...
Rain: what is this stealth?
yes Ponies47, that is fruit. Can I have it?
Hay everypony
What club I'm just staring at the desktop ponies
Long time no speak?
so rain you like most the same things i do except for math (i like it but im terrible at it) and Shizu becuae that the first time i heard of it
hi RainbowBlitz
00,10Wait, you only said Shizuka once rain.
it is when you can sneak up on someone without them knowing
Rain......i dont understand that concept
the ^7 is implied, Sumica
Hypothetically, I see someone doing unspeakable things to my nearly 2 year old niece, and I'm likely to snap someone's neck. Normally that would be crazy, but in that instance, it'd be justified.
Rain: I DONT UNDERSTAND THAT CONCEPT IN THE LEAST
/me Looks at Shamroc "Whats wrong? Don't you like me?" *Ear twitchs* :(
Ponies47 I will take that as a
"Yes"
/me takes the fruit
Ponies47...im not here..im about 20 miles away...i fled the second i through the fruit at you
i try to do that when i have ot go to bed i sneak up th stairs and climb the railings of the stairs to my room
Canadian_Brony: Take it away! *Curls up into a ball and starts shivering*
well i guess I am sane cuz I never act out
/me takes the fruit away
/me is blown away by the seeming randomness of this chat.
I never do anything irregular
i am like I said before too sane
RainbowBlitz: you think we're random now, try it when we're actually crowded.
RainbowBlitz aww, don't worry, this is nothing. Wait until Movie Night
I've been here when its crowded.
Right now there's only a dozen or so people talking :D
And i dont want to be ever again :$
but Rain..honestly i do not understand this concept....its fairly new to me....how does one be "stealthy"?
rainbow here another thing to blown away with GET READY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8 BAMM
hehe
Shamroc: What are you talking about? I'm right next to you? *Stares at Shamroc with eyes derped and with a smile on his face*
Alright kids, Flare is gonna go to bed, goodnight all, I wub you all <3
night Flare
Ponies47...yeah im gonna flee now
Nighty night FlareChaser :)
g'night FlareChaser
Shamroc: WAIT!
I bucking love pinkie pie. She would probably be the only one to get me to party
So... new topic?
im not listen to that song it makes me hear other things
Bye :3
too true lighting quill
i love that song
cher3ry . . . naah
Pinkie IRL would overwhelm me into total Fluttershy mode, tbh.
when it gets to the Leave now part I can't help but smile
i love her as well she would be the person i would sing the songs with and skip around town jumping on roofs
mfw im the only one talking in here anymore
I'm listening to her right now XD
/me tries to throw himself at the ground and miss
how could u miss the ground
13not sleepy..
???
/me fails catastrophically
Shamroc, just no
so you float?
ChronoClutch still figuring that out
ChronoClutch: You would have to be distracted at a critical moment.
Rain..what
critical moment?
im not a social person in RL i guess in way this counts but not really anyway i have been to few parties and never danced or cheered however if someone came as a pinkie pie reincarnate I WOULD DANCE LIKE A MO FO WITH HER/HIM
It's very, very hard, considering it's listed in, if I recall correctly, under the category of "recreational impossibilities"
I changed my name her because I use Golden Cyanide as my other username but it didn't sound to appropriate
ChronoClutch yes, a critical moment. Read "The Hitchiker's Guide To the Galaxy"
i hate reading
tl;dr
u kno wats up
k, Dash.
cher3ry Arthur Phillipe Dent can do it
CRITCAL FAILURE *re roll skill used* CRITCAL HIT (LOL D&D jokes)
i only read when I think I might find something interesting
i did not hit her it's not true its bullshit i did not hit her... I DID NAAHT... ohai bronystate
Ok yes I have had mental break downs before. It was because my parents we're getting devorced :S
Canadian_Brony: yes, but just remember he didn't suceed until the entire Earth was first destroyed.
hi valoreins
valoreins are you TOOMY WASSO
Ohai valoreins :)
I broke down once when I was 7 never again
cher3ry welcome to Science Fiction
Canadian_Brony: Welcome?
who is tommy wasso haugh?
13wisseau i believe
13made The Room
13which was apparently terrible
i know haaugh
Canadian_Brony: I may have read HHGTTG before you were even born xD
cher3ry imma random-crap-saying kinda guy, yah know?
Oh hai kitty
let's eat haaugh
hi Unnr
13pinkie i eat HAAUGH you eat HAAUGH
13let's go eat HAY
Oh(ai) Canada
:D
Shizuka it was Wisseau, and it was terrible.
heheheh i broke down in school after fail a final test that sent me back a grade i then felt like i blacked out and awoke in the hospital terrified (they never told me what happened just that i was expeled and i had a large cut on my self)
Who has seen epic pie time?
The Room is an amazing piece of art
i seen all pony videos
and this was in 2nd grade
I watched it as a dare for "Truth or Dare"
. . . eesh . . .
Also, one of my friends is a walking, talking incarnation of Pinkie Pie
and it can be... trying
Unnr: my condolances.
I WANT TO MEET THAT PERSON NOW
Unnr sounds like my sister
She was the bff of my twin sister
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0JahhFkts Epic Pie Time a little crazy but funny
btw who has a granny here that are an incarnation of Granny Smith?
i need a friend like that
why am i still listening to lavender town theme in my turtle beach do i want ot have nightmares for weeks?
Hiya everypony!!!
she talks, skips, talks, eats, talks, laughs, talks, smiles, talks, gets emotional, talks, and TALKS
ohai CrazyCherry
hi CrazyCherry
Ohai CrazyCherry :)
a friend like pinkie might fix me I am the total opposite naturally
It can be lots of fun, but sometimes its just too much to handle
well I can make others happy
but not myself
imma Twilight Sparkle
and then there is the Pinkamina side, which can be even more difficult to deal with
can he/she break the 4th wall?
Where would the 4th wall be in RL?
Let's consider the implications of that :-P
um life maybe
Quick_Thinker she tries really hard
death
IRL 4th lies between the world of Life and Death
4th wall*
and C brony imma Twilight Sparkle incarnet but unlike her lucky enough to make good friends i cant
valoreins: If you met my granny you would like her. Shes really nice but the only I don't like about her. She's never quiet she justs talks and talks and talks :(
I considered once a fictional character who tries to break the 4th wall constantly, except being set realistically, there was no 4th wall to break, so she'd end up randomly talking or winking at walls.
/me what 4th wall?
WEll it would involve us being concious of any person and or life forms looking at us through the fourth wall but in cartoons it would be looking into the camera or speaking into the audience
Quick_Thinker I'm a mixture of Twi and Flutters, if you can picture that
A Twi-Flutter mixture is very easy to picture, actually...
I fit in rlly well everyone knows me I can accomplish anything I try but wat is the point in trying let alone living when we r slaves to society
cher3ry k, good. I don't have to describe it
Ponies47: oh i understand that lol, actually my granny from my dad's family is considered as noisy too lol
well im a mix of mostly Twi big time and a very little bit of Pinkie's imgination
society has no sentience of its own, ChronoClutch. One can go with the flow, or one can rebel against it and thereby try to change its course.
valoreins: Granny from dads side of the family as well. She's nice and a great cook. But when she talks uggggggggh -_-
You know, my grandmother on my father's side is marrying for the third time now. And she's 85.
fireworks popping everywhere o.o
Also, hello everypony!
It's like saying a fish in a river is a slave to the current.
I may have a bit of Luna aswell
hi Polydunami
Hye Polydunami :)
Hiya Polydunami!!!
he is contained to the water
we're discussing pony traits IRL
we all have granny problems huh :s
Oh yeah?
We are contained to the Earth, at least for now
yeah
valoreins: Yeah :S
There will always be physical limitations on us.
well with laws a rules more comes with it
cher3ry: There's another cherry on here?? :O
ohai Ponies47
Chimi Cherry Changa!
CrazyCherry: only during "fruit hour" - normally I use the nick hen3ry
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBIe0R2e-A&feature=related *Hides in corner*
actually everyone from this world could relate to at least a character from MLP
for the love of clestia if they do discover gods atom can the scientists put all work towards findinght e Equestria Dimension IT EXIST I KNOW IT DOES
"fruit hour"?
Ok, are you talking about law then, or society? because those are seperate things ChronoClutch
managed to make a friends with a brony at a park :$
valoreins: I could :)
-_(\
ever think maybe ppl r murderers, convicts, thieves, etc. from the implicatios of rules and regulations
:3
society and rules r one in the same
they come hand in hand
Was anypony else wanting to smack Shining Armor during the finale?
so far i have seen no bronys at my school (i wear a brony shirt that says bro hoof if you knw what i mean and still no repsonse)
ChronoClutch: thieves, perhaps, but not murderers. Murder requires two things - to kill another person, and to have a criminal intent when you do it.
also one comment on my flootershai shirt :3
for example i could relate to rarity because of desiring attention of my art, fluttershy for loss of confidence, and twilight for sarcasm
Rules and Laws are not the same thing, however.
Rules are governed
I mean, I can see having your sister not talk much about you to her friends... but not telling your sister you are engaged? That is so.... UUUUGH
You know, Unnr, Shining Armor's mind was being controlled by Queen Chrysalis throughout.
Laws are proven facts
Yes
but engagements traditionally happen about a year out
Canadian_Brony: I'm talking about legal laws not scientific ones
Ponies47: i never try to make people into bronies
and it was proven that Cadence loved him in a legit manner
so yeah....
http://youtu.be/abBuwuBlcnY
Ponies47: wow, how did you show them? at least for me i made a quarter of my class into bronies lol
cher3ry ok, nevermind. I can't help yah there. I stay away from political laws and crap like taht
*that
Remember that letter in Dragon Quest? The one that was never read before being burned in lava or something?
all of the spheres from anthology 2 including some deleted scenes
The state of mind matters.
who here thinks they are sane?
cher3ry: Ooh~!
mix up the chat, yah know?
CrazyCherry: yes? :D
What do you mean, Canadian_Brony?
insane?
Canadian_Brony, we're all insane
Sanity is relative
Polydunami good answer
valoreins: Why does it seem like everypony else always gets the good end and I get the bad part? :( But I tyed to show one of em the show but he wouldn't watch. The 2nd he watched the first part of the first episode and about about 1/2 of the 2nd part. He didn't like it :(
Ah. No stream. Yay.
hi Kencolt
My personal belief is that we are all operating under our own illusions for the purpose of our own enlightened self-interest.
00,02hmmm
no responses to my stand point I thought not ^_^
00,02ksp, dx:hr or myst
too true
hi Phase4
STREAM!!!
dat Phase4
Cya everyone, I'm headin to bed
I don't personally kill cows, and I don't think about the dead cow when I eat a hamburger, because it doesn't look like a furry cute creature.
00,02or programing
WOOO!!!
g'night SolairePony89
00,02i has a thing i want to impliment in paintchat
http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/ test your personality out
that's a mental illusion. If that illusion drops, I probably couldn't eat the burger.
GODDAMN POP-CORn
Dat Phase4 stream.
ohai Phase4...dnt kill anything too important today
u cant honestly ever get ur personality checked
00,10dat kerbal wallpaper
Ponies47: maybe they have different taste in cartoon...? but most of ppl that like MLP appreciates art. maybe because i studied at arts and design university that my friends also likes MLP, but that's just my hypothesis
Hi, all. Well, the fourth is done-- and darn it, the fireworks were just a WEE bit too far away for me to watch them from my house, and if you think I was going to walk nearly a mile in this heat in the DARK you are kidding yourselves.
Nope but it helps
You know, Lightning-Quill, I took that test a few months ago.
Not with my present state anyhow.
00,02Sumica, ikr
ChronoClutch: my point is don't feel like society is enslaving you, that's giving others power over your mind, and your mind is what it can't have unless you give it freely
ChronoClutch: if you don't like something in society, work to change it, even if just in small ways.
valoreins: (Sighs) I guess so. I would like some brony friends to hang out with but it never seems to work :(
i couldnt care enough
dat kerbal background
that's my advice anyway
dat linux terminal
i never meant in and of myself
For me, July 4th is just another day.
others get jobs and think they enjoy it
00,02was debugging an issue
Ponies47: well, good luck finding other bronies in your region :)
00,02turns out i'm dumb
Does anyone here knows about Quebec day?
Ponies47: soon, you will find bronies in your area :)
Ain't we all, Phase4?
00,02and my icons are all aranged wrong
but the truth is they only like these things from the influences that they grow up with
valoreins: I hope.
July 4th? it's already July 5th here...
look at the world around us it is a dieing ecosystem and wat we do to things that harm us is eradicate them, from my point of view the more ppl die the better but I don't feel that I am the one to take ones life away
Phase4 oooh, I hate that
As I said-- it's over in the US.
ChronoClutch: um... you might be talking on a deeper level than I'm prepared to handle at the moment.
lol
Except maybe Hawaii. Not so sure about that...
ya it is a pointless
ChronoClutch: I don't see a distinction between liking something because you "naturally" like it or because your experiences have shaped it.
discussion
What's this fruit hour?
Everyone has had experienced, and such experiences shape us all.
00,02i broke ti more
00,02it
ChronoClutch, have you watched the movie watchmen?
00,02will fix later
yep watched it
CrazyCherry: unofficial change your nick and do nothing else special about it hour, basically
I can see why you think like that then
11,02Shamroc: Hai :3
00,10Good job breaking it hero
00,02so
ohai SuperBrony64
cher3ry: Oh.
To all you bronies out there tonight, I bid you a plesant morning/evening/late afternoon
yours already fits the theme so it wouldn't make a difference anyway
HI MOM!
00,02everyone ok with programing and music?
Eyup.
Phase4 I'm cool
Phase4: oh hoho traking requests?
how is you?
00,02i may alt tab betwene kerbal
*taking
Ponies47: dosent seem like much of a problem at least its one brony
Phase4: I don't hear anything
Only if it's C or C++ or Perl. None of this fancy pants Java stuff.
Work calls, however, and I have a few tasks to do before it entangles me in its foul clutches.
00,02Ponies47, probably not
Phase4: Okie doki loki. That's fine
*hope
i went swimming today
00,02bronyradio is ok but i tend not to like the music
Yeah, I don't do well with pessimism. Not all the time, at least.
What is the meaning to life?

Anypony here like TMBG?
I don't get that reference

TheRandomkid321 read "The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy"
I'll say it again. I don't do well with pessimism.
What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
TheRandomkid321: Nope :(
African or European?
Phase4 /)^3^(\
Very good
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB27079BB81FD3C9E&feature=view_all
JUst don't put BronyDanceParty I find their music disturbing
I'm not sure, cher3ry. Is that African or European?
Phase4, if you have the Pony Music anthology, its hard to go wrong with a mix of makkon, DrDissonance, &I and notacleverpony
dat Kencolt ninja :S
Polydunami: Age before...whatever.
Ponies 47 Oh... Well anyways... Congrats on beating the most powerful country in the world...s leftovers... But still.... With the help of the french... Umm...
so i explained bronies to my uncle, he didnt seem to care
Hey Kencolt, age and beauty can go hand in hand.
Also, ChronoClutch, are you new here?
I never said anything about beauty.
00,02i still hate windows
The French were a great help. They only won one direct naval confrontation with the British in the entirel 18th Century, I believe, and that was at Yorktown.
00,02no job controll in therminals
It was implied, Kencolt
13Phase4: i know they let in too much light
00,02XD
wat u mean am I new? Wat would make you say that? I actually want to know :P
/me 00,02hugs Shizuka
I've never seen you before, actually. I was just wondering.
00,02oh, on another note
Polydunami: Was it? Was it really? For who knows what thought lurk withing the depths of thois old wolfs mind?

ShiningArmor: You should feal bad. But it's ok! :d
Ya know what's bullsh!t? Battlefield 3 premium. Not only does it cost as much as buying the game, Whenever you are killed by someone who has a premium account it rubs it in your freakin face... GOD I hate it.

I got alot of artists in my music folder
You, Malavolent?
. . . "Ill Fly Higher" I believe this one is
IS THAT SCOOT?
CrimsonPhoenix "Ill Fly Higher", Scootaloo's theme
Ninjazz: I'm tired as well. It's strange how you wake up tired if you sleep too much :S
Hell yeah
CrimsonPhoenix just a preview
Malavolent, is it strange if you get tired from not sleeping at all?
Paintchat seems simlpe enough
"Everfree Showdown" Vinyl Scratch's Theme
00,10yeah not yet Phase4 but it's part of the next build
00,02cant wait :3
Ninjazz: Well, not really :D But I know that feel, I was tired yesterday becuase I had been to a lan party, therefore I hadn't got any sleep at all.
Malavolent, was it fun? :3
91 is the lowest i've seen in Bronystate O_O
Ninjazz: You bet it was. I only have a netbook but we still played a load of great games. :)
I've seen colder temperatures, Darkts3.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG lowest I've seen was 89
but with the humidity it feels like 98.
00,02hmmm
00,02this is not helping
Wow. Only a netbook? Your options are kinda... limited, Malavolent. :S What did you play?
Night of Nightmares
Theme of Nightmare Moon and Halloween Special
Ninjazz: Batlefield 1942, Age of Empires 2, Alien vs Predator 2, Diablo 2, Warcraft 3... and that's as far as I can remember.
Right, back to more classic Doctor Who.
Malavolent, all I needed to hear. Sounds epic! :D
Have fun, Polydunami. :3

paintchat fixed? hooray!
I'm glad someone elses listens to these kind of songs.
Rain: want
Well I ragequit my drwaing and wrote BALLS TO IT over it... Go to paintchat if you want to see it... I didnt mess up heavy in any way though.
Malavolent I'm listing off each one as they come on
cuz I'm awesome like that
Canadian_Brony: Good for you :D
I saw a video about a rocket ship crash and wrote "DAMN YOU PHASE 4!" As a comment on the video
I particularly like ending of this song.

Oops what?
Ghosties!
04So I had Meunster cheese today
Hm?
04Best cheese ever
Hey there, Ghosties.
Nice.
Oh hey Ghosties
o hai Ghosties
Ghosties nope... panda cheese is better ^-^
Wait.... It hasnt exploded yet/// WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS!?
04o-o panda...cheese?
hi Ghosties
04Oh, um, hi everyone
Evening Ghosties.
easy cheese is best cheese
never say no to panda
Ghosties, you never seen the commercials?
/me shakes head
I once didnt buy panda cheese.... My sh!t got F^cked up.
hay Ghosties
TheRandomkid321, its Phase4 this time, that is why
TheRandomkid321: :O
Don't listen to panda, Ghosties. He's crazy.
This is a sensible design, albeit perhaps _too_ minimal to go for the Mun.
/me twirls a hoof around his head
04Oh, easy cheese is good too~
Ghosties, youtube will be you best friend for this one. Look up "never say no panda"
I liek coon cheese.
04...I don't want to see panda cheese :s
cher3ry, he has made it to minmus with something like that before
Something similar, sure, but I think it was just short of the delta V you need to get there.
00,02dis one is allmost orbit capable
00,02needs more rockets
00,02Rain, it was a little larger than this
00,02was probably using quad
Ghosties hahahaha its nothing bad its just a hilarious commercial where a panda fucks stuff up because people say no to him xD
I usually do Hex.
Hey... Planet earth is blue and theres nothing we can do.
00,02tri and quad have been my most successfull designs so far
04Ah, maybe sometime then
^-^
TheRandomkid321: we just need a bunch of koolaid mix
Lunar Nocturnality ~ Celestial Diurnality - Theme of the Royal Sisters
this is Lunar Nocturnality - Luna's theme
of course
00,02tri and quad are fundimentaly the same cradt
00,02craft'
StupidSexyCJ I was refrencing a song... Planet earth is blue nad theresnothing I can do.
00,023 stage, srb's on launch
00,02the first stage consists of liquid engines that are dropped somewhere in orbit
00,10looks like some of the other things planed is weight and thrust calculators
00,02second is another liquid stage
00,023rd is the lander
Most successful rockets are going to be somewhat similar. Symmetrical, distinct staging, and a good lander design
00,02Sumica, that would be very helpfull
My lander's more complex than yours, but yours is absolutely servicable, and perfectly capable of minmus.
00,02cher3ry, you say that
00,02and yet both tri and Sumica's pyramid are mun capable
00,02cher3ry, screenshot of your lander?
Yes, well, Sumica's pyramid is a big boomstick.
One sec
gotta load it up. Basically it's yours with three side half-tanks feeding into the central tank, and the landing legs are on the side tanks, to make it wider.
Phase4: make it go booom
00,10I still find it funny that every one doubted my monster tower could get off the ground.
00,02JRP2234[Web], that will happen on its own
Because we expected boom, Sumica
Celestial Diurnality - Celesita's Theme
00,02cher3ry, i've thought of a design like that
00,10admidtly it's slow as hell in the second stage
00,02help with returns
I played one of those interctive adds... 5 popups in a row.... I probably got a virus... but i'm on a mac.... :D
also helps with landings. I can land on a fairly decent slope and still be ok
00,02Sumica, and it works and can be piloted to the mun
00,10yeah I know, I have taken it there a few times
00,02cher3ry, true that, i have trouble with slopes in mine
00,10I have modified the desgine a bit
00,02this design requires more rocket
00,10I swaped out all the couplers with the ones that cover the nozzles
00,10added a bit more RCS and legs
What is this game anyway? Does it cost money? And is it for mac? probably not.
00,02TheRandomkid321, not sure about mac
00,10btw Phase4 cool thing I found out.
00,02i think there is a mac version
What is the game called?
TheRandomkid321: nothing costs money if you know where to look, *wink wink nudge nudge*
00,02.13 is free, this is .15.2
00,02kerbal space program
00,02Sumica, yeah?
00,10if you hook fule lines from side tanks to the nozzles on say a centerline booster
StupidSexyCJ You can get in prison if you know where to look...
00,10it will pull from the lines first before it pulls from the attached tanks
"I'll Fly Higher" - Scootaloo's theme
00,02Sumica, i did that with tri and quad
00,02gona do it on this one too
00,02wait
00,02do you meen draw from the connected tank or the whole assembly?
00,10say like on you currnt one on screen.
00,10if you ran a line from the outside tank to the center booster.
00,02yeah, thats the plan
00,10the booster attached to the fule line wont touch the tanks above it
I may buy it... COnsidering how much my sister buys online... I should be able to get a game...
00,10till the tanks the fuelline is hooked to are dry
00,10but you have to attche it directly to the nozzles
Anyway, my Munar lander: http://derpy.me/vpKCV
00,02i have silly plans for this
00,02ooo
00,02cher3ry, nice
00,02seems a little heavy though
can't see it, but there's a third pod hidden by the central core
It is slightly heavy, but I find that adventageous actually, I have a hard hand on the controls...
00,02thats true
light ships go out of control even with ASAS
00,02small one swings around
Usually I drain the side tanks landing. After launch, eject the side tanks for mass reasons, and plenty of delta V for a controlled return
00,10you dont have issues with that version of the SAS packing up on you once you break atmo cher3ry?
00,02heres where the silly starts
Nope, it works perfectly fine, Sumica
"Ponies are Cool" - Theme of Doctor Whooves
No difference between the atmosASAS and the spaceASAS as far as I can tell, the atmos ones just look a bit better.
00,10I realy like taht some one made couplers taht hide the nozzles
yeah, thats one of the few mods I'd consider installing in my "clean" version. I have two versons, one modded and one stock.
just blow it up already
I ate toast on my bed and now.... CRUMBS!
the normal SAS applys force to exactly where it is on the ship. the ASAS takes over your controls and litterally uses everything the ship has in movement to keep it pointing in the same direction
G'night
Ok this now looks like the pyramid of doom
Are you sure this will work?

oh
My favorite animal is a horse. I love horses.
no
ponys
00,10this desgine looks famular =p
inb4 large explosion
00,10solids cliping, thats gonna be bad
And they also eject outward...
00,10they are gonna probably break
even dry that could be a problem
they are going to boom first
00,10all dem overheats
what!?
00,02well
I call hax
00,02that went well
oh theres the boom
againn
you ejected the liquids too soon?
again
00,10supprised the ejection charge on those center solids did't cause an issue
or did the solid ejection damage the liquids?
what Sumica said
Phase4: needs more rockets
you probably have enough delta V with just the liquids anyway
00,02JRP2234[Web], ikr
00,02cher3ry, not quite
00,02i meen yeah, more than enough
00,02but i want more
lol
alex s is best troll
Ja wohl, herr von Braun :D
00,10that reminds me, I need to check on my extra solar mission
it's still 68 years from escape
I lve hungry jacks.
*love
lol\
i cant be botherd to walk to hungry jacks
00,02makes a prety paturn
00,02XD
that was long . . .
00,02Sumica, tell me what happens if you actually make it out
I still think your spelling is so cute Phase4 :3
00,02i imagine its simply a floating point number limit
/me 00,02hugs XAX :3
yeah that's my understanding
lemme check on mine
00,10oh boo, it never saved them
My goodness, the Sensorites are pacifist to no end.
Right now, it's 2,677,125,977,752 m from the sun, at a speed of 12,614.7 m/s
this guy's gonna explod so hard
it's 1:45 am here
00,02dis should go far
inb4 in an update it will add more solar systems and if you are good you can land on another planet and find another launch pad :3
00,02Sumica, :(
00,02Rain, dat
I can't even find my escape path anymore, doesn't matter.
00,02WOULD BE EPIC
00,02and epic dificult
00,10easy fix, I just remake it
00,02i think this rocket is trying to break
00,10but yeah no landing for that crew, it was just tons of SRBs
yeah, hitting the moon is tricky... doable of course, but tricky. But hitting another solar system...
hit he big red button!
Off by one millionth of a second of a degree and you miss
00,10is it leaning to the side?
pootis
color me surprised, it's not burning
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
This will make a pretty explosion
it's rotating but that's ok as far as it goes
lotta vibration
should'e added some struts
he never braced the bases to each other did he
nup
00,02oh wow
00,02this has too much fuel
them's hanging free like redneck-balls
damnit, GalaCon is sold out T.T
00,02i'm looking at kerbin escape with the upper stage full
00,02at leats i was untill i accidentaly hit space
lol
lul
you're titlting
personal favourite
yeah, he has no actual control over the bottom anymore, and not enough thrust to escape the bottom either
at least not safely
hey does anyone here use the SAI paint tool like Wrek?
its going down ! oh nooo
highway to BOOOOOOM
Oh no
00,10oh dear
aiight bed time for me :P
00,02well
gnight ChronoClutch
00,02that was awesome
OH MY GOOOOOOOOODDD!!!!
Phase4: have you landed safely on the moon yet?
Uh oh it broken u lost
dat panic eject
00,10almost got roasted by the boosters
yeah, Kerbin doesn't handle that situation well...
I'm back
:p
00,02this is a new rocket
welcom back Polydunami|DoctorWho
damn i missed the moon landing :3
00,10I realy want to try the whole spaceplane landing thing but I should probably give up on that idea
00,10unless i strap it to the ToP it's just not happening.
spaceplanes drive me batty...
00,02i cant build planes
00,02aparently i'm a master of rockets
huh
I think phase4's design is the only feasable shuttle method - strap the rockets to the sides.
Right, I'm going to watch some more Doctor Who.
00,02who cant build a plane
I was expecting an explosion
00,10Heavy 101 is the only desgine I got that is close.
central mount causes breakage
Phase4 me
00,10but the SAS fails on me
phase4 mar rokets
00,02cher3ry, you realy cant attach to the top/bottom
suddenly i have a "master of puppets" remake as "master of rockets"
mind you, I've never played this before
yeah, the SAS on the planes is borked
Sumica: you just need to balance the weight. once you lose atmosphere your wings can't keep you stable anymore, that's why you're on this atmos-SAS vs space-SAS thing
"Crepusclarity" - Twilight Sparkle's Theme

I can't help you guys on these ones
this is totally new to me
this is kinda painful to my ears.
00,02this is kinda wrong for mun/minmus
TheRandomkid321 turn down your volume
00,02tri/quad are moon bound
then go solar!
00,02this is more of a interplanetary thing
/me is wearing headphones, so suck it
00,02but theres no other planets
except there's only one planet
00,02Canadian_Brony, headphone bro's /)
Cnadian_Brony I don't liek the song volumes fine
throw science at the wall and see what sticks!
Phase4 /)
Canadian_Brony (/ headphones for the win brutha
I have headphones on too :D
SCIENCE
Yeah
TheRandomkid321 everyone has their own tastes
00,10oh this song. altho never heard it set to smile
what song is this?
00,02hmm
remix of smile^3
Where have I heared this musci before? MINE TURTLE!
this sounds awesome with Bass-enhancing Headphones
00,02i dont know how to fly this thing
Phase4: magics
00,02its too heavy for gyro's
like a rocket
gotta thank XAX for that
00,02and i didnt put enough rcs on it
but name of remix?
00,02Smile Song (The Living Tombstone's Remix)
just do it filly!
00,02not liking this playlist much
thnx Phase4 :$
00,02Rain, jk
00,02k'
00,02nah
00,02its drifting
use a bigger gyro!
00,02somethings slightly uneaven
the solids.
00,02the upper bit should be moon capable on its own
they're not perfectly symmetrical with the rest of the rocket's own drag
I don't like many pony songs... Some of the select few I like are Discord eurobeat brony. September Livivng tombstone. And any remix of alex s.
^
00,02yeah
00,02i have no control
lololololollololoolool
somehow its working
00,02upper part works fine though
RIP... Three aliens....
Kerbals are heroes!
of science
00,02oh yeah
this is one of the few songs where i like the remix's as much as the original
00,02this thing has tonns of fuel
What am I being thanked for, Canadian_Brony? :D
Phase4 try to burn it up before landing. That thing must be freakin' heavy
Try to ille the aliend >:D
*KIll the aliens
XAX you showed me some awesome headphones in, like, April? IDK, but I finally got my hands on a pair. /)^3^(\
chat derp back
00,02Canadian_Brony, it is
00,02i tend to drop tanks on the mun
Canadian_Brony: :D
I need better headphones than... headphones that came WITH a phone i got :\
I like this remix. It's alex s right? or tombstone? Any way I liek it
with that lander design you have to. What you have, just a single half-tank on that final stage?
TheRandomkid321 I need a phone for my basemant
I have headphones, a TV, computer, universal remote, but no phone
so close
Ha ha.
I'm not saying it's improper, but, we don't get to detach a lunar lander and return to Earth using the main ship like the Apollo guys did
at least not without mods
00,02der we go
00,02orbit
this is catchy
Dat orbit, very nice.
00,02cher3ry, i cant wait untill we can do that
I mean, REALLY catchy
song name?
00,02i have a shuttle like thing thats perfect for that
ARe there any headsets taht are compatable with computer and xbox 360? I need a new xbox headset since my old one was on full volume with a kid raging on cod... Bugger broke my headset.
Same. That'll make designing a lot more fun
00,02Canadian_Brony, pinkies lie
00,02so
00,02mun or minmus?
welp now I'm up to V11 of the mlp music archive
TheRandomkid321: i dont think so
also this song is cool
Minmus is easier to land on, you have the delta V for either.
00,02minmus is a pain to get to so mun i'm say
Phase4 k, thx . . . wut?
true, Minmus requires a couple adjustments.
/me is confuzzled
and it's 5 so I'll go to bed
night peeps
g'night CrimsonPhoenix
Darkts3 Okay... I thik an xbox one is in my top priotities.
00,02cher3ry, do you happen to know what those pink things on the navball are?
Pink, no, just the yellows
00,10the pink marks is homebase Phase4
I lpve dis song...
00,02hmm
00,02Sumica, oh, k
buck yeah!
lol
Discord!
/me would sing if it weren't 2:00 am
00,10one is you are heading directly away from the othere is heading twords.
I am signign this song currently :D
For minmus I find it's easier to just skip bothering Kerbal orbit, and just fly straight to a perip of 47.4, then make a north-south adjustment, then fly at 270 and do a collission course.
/me is lip syncing instead
:3
/me is singing this at 2 am
I huge ice cold glass of water, then Sleepy time for Dismo, Thanks for the streams. It was nice to see them after being gone for a month, Seeya tomorrow everyone.
night Dismo
I'm sure there's more fuel efficient ways to do it, but it's not a blindly stupid way either.
I would sing, but my grandparents would have my head if I woke up my lil' sis
00,02waiting
g'night Dismo
I like songs with singing in them.. Not just sounds and voice clips thrown together... But thats just me.
Canadian_Brony: lol
00,02cher3ry, i'm not sure whats more efficent
00,02i just find kerbin orbit easier to aim
There is an epic music video for this song... Fan made but awsome.
aand Im back. Hello everyone!
TheRandomkid321 I know what you mean. I like both lyric and acoustic songs
hi Alchemist
Well most efficient would be to find the direct vector and be heading on it when you escape, so that your periph was _at_ Minmus' zone of influence.
but that's math.
and a moving target
Cnadian_Brony Aucoustic is good... Just dubstep and techno remixees NO GUSTA!
passed my last exam, got a B and Im happy for it. Gonna lay down for an hour to celebrate :D brb
second best would be to launch at the magic time when Minmus crosses the orbital equitorial plane, so you don't need a N-S adjust burn.
but that's still math :/

this playlist i starting to sound like my playlist :D
00,02WOAH
00,02dats an orbit
is*
No contracts? Good. I don't like putting my name around
00,02what apolo did here was not impact
00,02and allso setup lunar orbit
00,02which uses VERY little fuel
this seems deserving . . .
I think our moon is much more massive compared to Mun, tho.
00,02then drop the lander
00,02cher3ry, it is, but its less dense
so the Apollo orbit was a figure 8 basically.
and I'm back
hai everyone
hi OneTrickPony
00,02i like how i'm prety much going infront of the mun and stopping dead
btw, I'm Canadian_Brony if anypony's wondering
00,02this will be totaly safe
Phase4 of course! How do you think I got up there?
hey OneTrickPony!
00,02XD
how are you?
The other thing is the physics hack the game uses. Until you reach Mun's zone of influence, Mun's gravity on your ship is zero.
00,02^
All this space travel Reminds me of this guys 24 hour stream which had some X-COm ufo defense... There where 50 people on chat why was I chosen *curls up in corner* The carnage....
00,02'sphere of influence' and all that
00,02physics engine cant do n-body's
AEIOU
screw physics, I'm Pinkie Pie
Which is not what Apollo dealt with... it's a gradual rampup of Moon's gravitational influence relative to Earth on a constant curve.
I'll stick to Chemestry, thx
*chemistry
00,02yeah
which is why it's almost impossible to end up in Munar orbit directly... may be literally impossible on a single burn
00,02i'm going to slow to zero then start falling
are you going to make it?
hai MahBoi777 srry I went to go get water, I'm doing fine how bout you?
00,02cher3ry, it is imposible
I'm not positive it's literally impossible, but it's highly improbable.
00,02any orbit that gets you too mun allso gets you away from it
00,02or impacting it
00,02eiter way, you need to slow once there
OneTrickPony: lol it's okay, that's good! I'm doing fine, got to see some fireworks last night
00,02or, in my case, speed up
ksp is the hardest thing ever, i cant even get into orbit
MahBoi777: same and they're illeagal here :3
Bloomburg . . .
You'd have to get to Mun and be traveling close to Munar's relative velocity at the same time... so it can't be at perip. But then your angular away from Mun is too high, so it can't be _too_ far from perip... a perip that just skims Mun's ZOI... maybe.
I'm gonna hit they hay NIGHT EVERYPONY! :)
g'night Ponies47
hai Ponies47
00,02der we go
00,02now i'm not going to impact
Goodnight Ponies47!!
night Ponies47
OneTrickPony: lol nice
eclipse!
gnight Ponies47! sleep well
00,02lets try for landing
detatch the main vehicle!
I have managed once to see a solar eclipse from the Mun tho. :D
prepare for landing!
have to land very very close to the Munar equator, but if you do, Kerbin will properly eclipse the sun
cher3ry that's amazing
/me Hugs #bronystate
/me was hugged
and naturally you have to land on the light side... and I think close to the prime meridian too.
not sure of the last bit
00,02good
00,02landing on the light side
derp
00,02cher3ry, dont HAVE to
that is all
00,02just very much prefered
00,02what with the lack of proper altimiter
yeah
00,02that REALY needs to be added to the game
well, I land by shadows usually.
my lander has plenty of fuel to do that tho
So yeah. Goodnight wubs and all that other (squee) :)
brace for impact!
darkside landings are very tricky... no shadow clue to tell you you're on final approach
. . . eventually . . ?
00,02cutting it a bit close here
00,02cher3ry, i find the shadow comes in too late anyway
I'm usually below 20 m/s when the shadow appears, but I have an extended landing sequence usually.
I almost never enter Munar orbit.
brb
So has he reached his objective?
lol what is this game?
kerbal space program, Mister
hi Mister. Couldn't tell yah
Kimple Space Program or somethin.
Kerbal.
CLOSE ENPUGH!
That's impressive there. Haven't managed that type of approach... might have to try it next time.
land aliens on the moon
*ENPUGH!
lol Kimple
*ENOUGH!
BRACE FOR IMPACT!
Prepare for landing...
. . . eventually . . ?
SO whne do you fight the hostile aliens?
What is he playing btw?
hey
00,02well
00,02shit
ouch
NO!
00,02i screwed that up bad
*boop*
lol
too much lateral speed. they survived, but are stranded.
Time for Nixon's speech
oh f*ck!
/me boops Major_Frank
They came to explore in peace, and there they shall rest in peace.
spinning like a boss
hey Major_Frank! Kerbal space program
I see...
00,10well at least they live
Is that supposed to happen *Points at screen*
Where are the enemy aliens?
00,02they could probably fix that
they will live to see luna
00,10this is what the third crew you have stranded on the mun
at least you made it to the moon
00,02Sumica, i think its the fith
Major_Frank: all part of science
Ahh science
My trip was worse
Explains so many things
and may i also ask what is with all the different theatres
It was an impressive approach until the very end.
banishment is not a fun experience
00,02but yeah
No enemy aliens? This is great
00,02point is the rockets not big enough
Thats one badass rocket you got there
Phase4 it needs more cowbell
This time brig DUCT TAPE!
that'll help
gonna visit California in about a week, can't wait /)^3^(\
TheRandomkid321 he is. How else is it holding together? I should know, my other Bronystate name is Canadian_Brony for a reason
You know what annoys me about this song (the original has a bit of it too, but it's smoother transition at least) is Fluttershy starts sounding too Pinkie. Yes, I know, same VA, but...
rdibp have fun there! Take lots of pictures!
What in the hoof is this?
Twi: Science
Twi the music, or the rocket?
Twi: Phase4 is the best at Space.
The rocket..
btw, hi Twi
hi
00,02hen3ry, /)
Phase4: (\
Twi just that. Phase4 is trying to land on the moon with a giant rocket that still needs more cowbell
He was trying to LAND on the moon? O:
Okay..
I though he wanted to go THROUGH it
He did land on the moon, technically.
00,02Major_Frank, i allmost landed
The landing was a lil harsh
00,02well, i allmost didnt break when landing
Major_Frank eeyup. He did land, but his lander disintegrated
the legs broke off the lander, but...
00,02it didnt disintergrate
hen3ry and the main pod fell off
no boom, no deaths - except from being stranded there forever
ANd thats when moonbase alpha comes in
the main pod is designed to break off. Granted, that's for return, but...
00,02dis should work
00,02using the ones with thrust vectoring this time
this sounds familiar . ..
00,02so i have SOME controll on takeoff
"some"
I dont want to look D:
it won't be enough
Did I ever tell you guys about that time I was drafted into a UFO defence program or somethin? We went half way across the world to help some citizens who where in danger... We had to abandon them though because our men kept getting shot... mostly friendly fire.
I make a fair amount of use over vectoring engines myself.
My core rocket is six regular rockets around a central vectoring one.
Looks promising..
so many words i can't comprehend xD
straight as a bullet.
That's supposed to look like that right?
Uhhh.
Yeah!
still a bit of spin to it, but that's fine.
AdamTheDuck just go with the flow. When that isn't enough, go straight to Google
TheRandomkid321:
. . .
00,02not sure how to get them out of there
yeah
00,02not realy moving here
00,02going up sure
oooh
that's interesting
00,02need the bigger rockets
Phase4 slowly, but surely
Behold!
are you slowing?
The slowest rocket of all time
can't tell from this resolution
Phase4 you need more cowbell
Glad I aint on that ship...
00,02hen3ry, i'm speeding up now
00,02it wasnt slowing much
00,02sort of stabalizing
I have a phase on my latest one where it does that for a bit.
less atmosphere and gravity=higher acceleration and terminal velocity
00,02but yeah
solid breakoff tends to cause that. although I've never carried my dead solids like _that_
00,02the thrust vectoring is a godsend
So... Whould we ring those guy's famalies now or what?
00,02i can controll the thing now
in layman's terms: the higher, the faster
Do a backflip!
00,02TheRandomkid321, i unno
00,02not my job
00,02well
lol no do a triple heal flipple
it also gets faster as it gets lighter because fuel's burned off
00,02nvm
ouch
whoa.
erm... boom
what happened
Okay
*sich
*sigh*
Do a barrel ro-OH MY GOD YOU KILT EM!
Who bought explosives on our ship?!
/me Picks up telephone
it needs more cowbell
looks uneven
And I clikced on anpther ad :\
TheRandomkid321 *cringe* I hate that
uneven burn rates tho.
I asked which couler was my favorite.
Major_Frank: it was aliens sir
00,02should have more controll and power now
okay im back
I have their famalies on speed dial sir.
Good
don't be silly. We have a high attrition rate in KASA, so we only send orphans.
00,02i forgot about fuel XD
I have 1 can of Coca-Cola left on stand-by
00,02theres gona be an uneven fuel use
00,02ah well
yup
00,02too late now
KASA?
Kerbal Aeronautic and Space Administration
Phase4 that could cause problems
Okay
00,02forgot about the second set of srb's
it means when the strong rocket's tanks are dry, the vectoring ones will still have a bit of fuel.
Oh god who let you build these?
00,02yeah
shouldn't be a big problem, just an inefficiency really
00,02srb's are still geting stuck in the center
Phase4 I see tilting in your future
00,02might have to remove those ones
00,02Lunar_Brony, wow
00,02actualy nvm
At least if they die on thsi song it will eb epic.
00,02its not tilting
00,02why ISNT it tilting
Magnets
SHould it tilt?
because you have vectoring engines
you in space
no air resistance to pull you to the side
Phase4 I'm not psychic? Crap . . .
Open a window in there
Might help
those engines can compensate for a lot of fault
Major_Frank I don't think it has windows
MAKE WINDOWS THEN
Do i have to do everything here?!
I like this guys thinking
00,02:<
CRAP!
Major_Frank yeah. Find a way to get up there and install windows
hit space too early again?
Already did
XP?
too late, it destroyed itself
again
Didnt went acording to plan
-_(\
I might have done that
Sorry
00,02hen3ry, i didnt
Windows on a spaceship isnt the best sollution
so what happened then?
Funny. Discord is currently playing.
ka-BOOOOOM!
I love dis song
usually that only happens when a bottom section detaches and proceeds to ram the upper section
I find the possible coincidance amusing
Offcourse
DAMN YOU VICTO- I mean DISCOOOOOOOR!
Discord did it
that can't possibly fix it.
No I take that back, it is Kerbal...
00,02brb
strange things work sometimes
I blame the Nazis
Hey why you hatin Lunar_Brony
TheRandomkid321 not hatin', I'm making a joke
obviously, it wasn't very funny
/me cant' write jokes
Good... Never underestimate HITLER! (-_-)/
And I wonder why at the end of the dya people hate my presence...
Awkward silence.....
TheRandomkid321 Adolf Hitler was a great man. Excellent military strategist, just not meant to be a dictator. It doesn't help that he became mentally insane, too
Well, I've finally finished the Sensorites serial in Doctor Who.
Lunar can you blame the guy? He lost a testical.
00,02ok
00,02lets launch
Let's try'
Huh? How do you know that, TheRandomkid321?
Read it
I'm skeptical.
the same goes for Napoleon Bonaparte. The strategy and dictating, not losing a testical. *shudders*
00,10is it geting bigger?
thats what she said?
http://static.fjcdn.com/comments/I+m+pumped+Ima+a+snake.+Mmmmm+yea.+You+like+that+_3be21af86508896c1c490d84b7956c17.png
thats what she said
its going to blow up again
The engine sounds i lil broken
damnit Foster
lol
00,10sounded like part of it did
Goddamnit link
Next time I watch Doctor Who, the gang shall be in the midst of the French Revolution :3
you're gonna have to move your lower struts, Phase4.
thats what they're getting caught on
Uh uh
00,10drag chutes?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m12reofaLh1r1qdgvo1_1280.gif
Quite so, Lunar_Brony
no explosion, but this is a fail in itself
Huston..
he tried chutes to stop the central solids from getting trapped
at least I think that was the theory
Try going up next time Pilot Phase
Lunar_Brony, are you Canadian? Actually, never mind, I know you're Canadian_Brony.
00,02Sumica, i was trying to yank those srb's out
00,02they get stuck in the center
Polydunami you answered your own question. Congratulations
00,10ahh
00,02it didnt work
Phase4 You don't say?
I have delepoped a fear of space travel after being part of X-Com alien defence...
I feel belittled.
move the struts, that's what they're getting stuck in I think
brb
gnight bronystate! thanks for the stream Phase4
Goodnight MahBoi777
00,02night MahBoi777
night
Night night MahBoi777
mornin' bros, everythin' going good?
I have not seen a message from ALicorn_Prince_Shane in a while.
I'm sleepy, brony_swan
coffie?
Hang on, anypony ever heard from TheRainbowDash lately?
Nope
I'm back
Polydunami not seen him around
g'night MahBoi777
00,02hmm
Actually, it's a her.
00,02this design is not exactly ideal
TheRainbowDash is female
MY computer got a random black screen... Its good...,W AT TEH BUCK HAPPENED!?
sup, Lunar_Brony
Polydunami though he was on yesterday apparently
this equipment maker is trolling me.
I thought, Chrysalis, that TheRainbowDash was female.
brony_swan not much. It's almost 3:00 am here
only offer for download drivers on their newest parts... fuuuuuu-
00,02it can lift itself
00,02JUST
Polydunami i assume everyone is male unless given proof
^
00,02it wouldnt be able to take of without the srb's
Lunar_Brony: its 4:51 up here
00,02i tend not to assume gender at all
11:51 in da morning
00,02i assume you're all genderless blobs
/me isn't a genderless blob
oh yeah, Polydunami.
/me is just a blob
I'm male, bro
Hmm?
TheRainbowDash changed his name.
i take the name "BRONY" to its deffinition
her*
Oh yeah?
human to be more precise
Goes by Loyaldash mostly now.
LoyalDash*
Or sometimes NommyDash.
k I'm back
Oh man, I really prefer LoyalDash
Ikr?
WHy was their a glass shatrd on the floor taht nested into my foor ?
It's original. :D
Nah im just bucking round...
Guys.
Anyways, he doesn't hand around in mane chat anymore nowadays.
what Polydunami
?
Who Ninjazz?
One of my friends dislocated her shoulder today.
She hangs out in another chatroom.
SPIN
to win
um
WEEEEEEEEEEE
O.0
She was in excruciating pain.
OWch. :S
Polydunami ouch. Tell him the brony community gives him our regards . . . or, atlest a Canadian brony does
Who?
I specifically used female pronouns.
too much info...
Wanna hear fun info?
Anyway, she's fine now: my friends and I were playing in a field just across from the Fire Dept.
Polydunami your friend who dislocated HER shoulder. Sorry, I'm tired stupid
*stupid tired
**derp
Good change it
I'm quite tired as well, it's nearly three in the morning here.
Kickstart my hearth!
Polydunami
. . .
acousticbrony please :3
same
00,02i have concluded
00,02that the rocket is still not big enough
Mister_Foster we listened to it earlier
00,02i must construct aditional stages
aww
Oh no....
im just glad its summer but night classes are gettin' anoying
logical
I love this song
00,02actually
00,02nvm
it's catchy
00,02i has srs idea
/me mumbles to the tune because I dont knwot he lyrics.
/me dance
1 hr left in my download.... grr.
Phase4 enlighten up on this "srs idea"
*us
Hmm... I want to make a slenderman Creepypasta...
Or just any creepypasta for that matter...
Any ideas here?
TheRandomkid321 I got nothin'. Too tired
i do
hmm...
care to hear
I'm heading to bed. G'night everypony!
Yeah...
cya Lunar_Brony
I know
ok, heres the "idea
stay awesome Bronystate
XD
Nuts
rap
04No, Lunar. You stay awesome.
Yeah, rap can be rather obnoxious.
Lunar_Brony already left.
Soem rap is good... SOME
TheRandomkid321: ok, the story i got is is a "zombie"story but its like a story of a lone zombie that lurks around a city at night in the darkness
O_O
brony_swan COntinue...
04I know, I just felt like saying it Poly
Poly wants a cracker. :|
Hush hush
MOAR ROCKETZ!
TheRandomkid321: this "zombie" is sort uninfectous style of zombie a..."deamon" if you will
/me shoves a cracker down Poly's throat "There, you want a cracker? HAVE SOME MORE CRACKERS!" shoves more crackers down Poly's throat
Careful now, I'll soon be known as Deep Throat.
that's not actually the best way to do the fuel lines there I don't think
04You mean the informant from the Watergate scandal?
gtg mates.... Bye.... And I'll think abut the creepypasta
TheRandomkid321: you care about this or...should i just write it O_o?
00,02still not enough rockets
00,02but meh
Well, yeah, I was making the reference.
I'm somewhat stilted in my delivery right now, being tired and all.
04:/ I was hoping you'd go through with my reference but I guess it was too...misleading
And by the way, this is NOT Phase4.
00,02?
he means the voice
00,02what do you meen
00,02oh
00,02yeah
00,02thats someone else
ouch
uneven thrusters
00,02huh
00,02left some of my boosters behind
00,02oh well
Ghosties, I seem to recognize that reference. Would you mind prodding me in the right direction?
04Are you one of my fans, Poly? (reference)
Who needs boosters anyways?
your thrusters have to all be at exactly the same level...
at least at the base.
which is a pain
Nope. I don't get it.
04Bah, oh well
04I was going for MGS
Dat song
Metal Gear Solid. Woo~
Dayum
~
my way of trying to balance the landing pad, is to move the cockpit down until the engines are actually slightly underground, with the yellow just-barely peaking out from being buried, then match the others to that exact level
without a reference it's hard
I'm not too well acquainted with Metal Gear Solid, unfortunately.
04Eh, it's fine Poly
I've only played Sons of Liberty maybe ten years ago.
Ghosties, i think i love you...
o__o
00,02tis rocket
00,02why
00,02why does it not explode
ima gunna go play a game er sumthin' and then...come back? i dont know. Im not realy tired so brb in an hour or so...
uh... because it's a fairly decent design overall?
/me glomps Ghosties for making a MGS reference
Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade, Death came with friendly care. The opening bud to Heaven conveyed, and bade it blossom there.
Yup. I still got it.
04<panda> Ghosties, i think i love you... <-- No thanks, brah o_o
00,10what in the hay are you doing with that much fuel
Hey there, Kammerjunk.
Same to you, Kammerjunk :S
Oh hi, Ninjazz.
rollin
00,02hmm
00,02uneven burn
00,02Sumica, going to space
hai Kammerjunk
ah, I know why it's uneven I think.
its your use of fuel lines
00,10ok what acounts for half the tanks
imma guess this song is called keep rollin
the best way to use em, I think, is to link the bottom tank of the first stack to eject, to the top tank of the second ejection stack, and so on
Okay, friends. I'm tired now and I think I shall head for bed.
Ghosties :( denied?
that way the first-ejecting tank is constantly refueling the second tank to full, until it's totally empty
04Night Poly
Gnight, Polydunami. Take care.
04Eh...I don't really know you, panda
Goodnight everypony.
night Polydunami
04I don't put out on the first date, ya dig :I
00,02it didnt seperate the way i wanted to
00,02hen3ry, probably
00,02i think one didnt attach right
My hex design does it that way... three stacks drain to three others, then the other three drain to the central.
I think imma head off to bed too see ya guys later
It's going to be a busy day tomorrow; cleaning up for my mom and sister coming home.
00,02note to self: start burns sooner
XD hahaha Ghosties, so... when do ya think you'll start streaming? ^-^
I'm out
04I dunno, who knows
hi Kammerjunk :)
04I don't know
:(
04I thought it would have been mid June
see ya guys
Heus, Lil_B.
and hi panda :)
08,01yay
Lil_B ^-^
04But I can't seem to get my guy to find the time to just help me learn how to stream
bye OneTrickPony :)
08,01blue contact lenses for my pinkie pie cosplay arrived today!
00,02well
00,02i wasted a lot of fuel
WHY AM I NOT ASLEEP YET
Speaking of summer, did anypony know anything about the Steam Summer Sale?
Ghosties, Phase4 could teach you... i mean... he taught me ^-^
08,01yes, i'm putting that much effort into this cosplay that i actually went to get contact lenses.
steam summr sale has it begun?
Quick_Thinker: Eeenope.
that's a line I never intend to cross... the idea of putting glass directly on my eyeball makes me cringe.
drat
i do hope you can get cyan lenses thoguh
Does somebody know how to reduce cracking noises in sound-editing? I'm already quite low on the Volume so thats not the thing causeing it :/
04Hmm, maybe, but I wanna learn from the best (no offense, Phase :P)
Quick_Thinker: Should have, were past summer sales any indicator, but hasn't.
00,02XD
00,02Ghosties, well its me, Sumica or someone who's name i cant quite remember
^-^ sorry Phase4, i tried
Oh hey, Command & Conquer 3 and 4 + Red Alert 3 is on sale.
I liked Red Alert.
00,02cher3ry
00,02dats the name
eh?
00,02hen3ry, so tis you
yeah what about me?
uh oh...
somepony is in trouble...
00,10Told you before Ghosties I could help you but DCD said he was gona do it.
00,02gota wait untill the orbits intersect
I don't know anything about streaming...
I really want a pony shirt and they are 25% of on welovefine... Its so tempting...
00,10wow, so I built a rocket that goes so fast it colpsed the rcs fuel tank.
is it still, Lil_B? I thought that ended at 6 pm pacific time
/me finally goes and googles this game so he can play it
hen3ry oh, then its over I think
Nin|MightBeSleeping kerbal...
00,02lol
00,02dat orbit
the site was apparently hammered constantly from 11 am to... whenever.
00,02Sumica, XD
00,02Sumica, i'd love to see that
bronies are the internet's native, organic, accidental DDOS
Kerbal Space Program, yes?
Nin|MightBeSleeping: yes
Ah.
00,10do you have the shuttle mod still?
hen3ry I wanted to do it yesterday, but the site was down or incredible slow all day long... I bet they just didn't know what went wrong
Lil_B: I expect that is the case. They didn't realize how much demand there was still out there waiting for a price break.
lower cost, demand soars, server crashes.
hen3ry I would ave already bought something, but I hate shipping costs... no pony shirts manufacturers in the EU :(
00,10I could pas you the save file Phase4 if you want to try it out. But I dont know if you have the mods to use it.
I don't blame you. shipping is teh pain.
00,02Sumica, probably not, i'm running stock right now
00,10ah yeah would need the coupler mod and the shuttle one.
Yay~
why did I buy a graphics tablet from a company whose webserver is apparently attached via a 56k modem? sigh.
hen3ry: Because keeping up with technology is silly.
I think it was actually a case of "oooh, that's not too expensive, maybe I'll try that..."
00,02for some reason
followed by "fuuuuuuu- i can't draw"
00,02they are showing mlp:fim ads now
00,02toys, not show
00,02at 8:30 pm
00,02during the simpsons
lolwut
hmmm
hen3ry: Do ho ho. I can't draw worth my life either, still bought a tablet.
i wonder what could of caused that
ok this looks like a decent approach...
00,02dis is going well
INB4 pictures of Pinkie AND Fluttershy on a bike.
On one of those silly multi-seat bikes.
Kammerjunk: I thought she asked for both, actually, so...
Oh.
how a pony rides a bike is a question best left... well, I guess she wants it answered now.
Pinkie, sure... but how's poor FS gonna manage?
Magic.
ow
00,02well
Allo everypony.
that... wasn't the technique.
00,02i blame the rocket
Hey there, Meanwhile/
That went well...
Ooh, Phase is killing Kerbal.
00,02too fragile
00,02Meanwhile, no
00,02just stranding them on the mun
Because that's so much better.
they survived. it's a fate worse than death since they cannot be rescued
How is that moving?
gyros
There are plenty of fates worse than death.
WHAT IS THIS WITCHCRAFT?
although, that's clearly overpowered
Eternal life, for instance.
they have eternal life
00,02those tanks are mostly full too
00,02could have made it back
00,02with extreem ease
Phase4: What a waste.
But then you fell apart.
00,02probably even made it to minmus and back
What a shame.
00,02infact this craft is easily capable of that
00,02but yeah
00,02boom
00,02:(
Morning ponyfolks.
00,02should probably split before landing
00,02unless i can get gear on the center
at a distance of roughly 3.5 billion km from home
no
Now for something without context. http://i.imgur.com/o0qBn.jpg
those thrusters are too tall for the stock lander legs. I tried
...what?
will that actually work??
Meanwhile: Shame Shizu is asleep?
00,02i'm gona cheat
00,02and use the bug
Kammerjunk: Shame? Not if I don't want to take a boot to the head it isn't.
Fair 'nuff.
00,10so yeah this rocket Phase4, it pulls 35g's on ingnition
00,02XD
00,02Sumica, bit much
do the pilots survive that?
00,10and is doing 4500m/s by the time it hits 60km
They're Kerbal, they can survive anything except explosions and water.
Okay im back
00,02ok
00,02attempt two
00,02using the bug
00,02i heard noise
I thought they had a maximum G force tho.
00,02huh
00,02they must have fixed the bug
00,10problem is the g load must be damaging somthing or there is too much drag
What??
00,02not sure where the stream is
00,10cause the oper sections colapses
08,01http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Higgs-Boson-Particles-/251100388854
08,01i lol'd
00,02it can work
boomsound
27km particle accelerator sold separately
pff, I've got tons of Higgs Boson-like particles. 7297.35 seems pricy to me.
00,02	Q: Why is it so cheap?
00,02A: Hello Superjordansales - I am letting the market decide. This is a premium jar after all.
My higgs bosons are part of me. They keep my bits together.
I shan't be parting with them.
For 7 thousand quid, I think I can spare 3 or 4.
Worst landing ever.
FairysHuff: test
not the worst. At least they're within walking distance this time
I'm guessing the side-attachments are breaking
Am I the only one who thinks Dashie is more cute than she is awesome?
hai everypony :3
FairysHuff: Test
FairysHuffTest
dat boomn
Boom.
They lived?
HAI EVERYPONY :I
Trying to get my mIRC client to make a sound when someone TABS my name so I know I'm getting a message. Though not having much luck.
Phase4: you may want to quit and restart, physics might be broken by this point
FairysHuff: Does this help? :P
00,02little bit more kerbal then back to programing
Spell-of-Gaming Sadly no ^_^ Still no sound beep.
Phase4: That's what they all say... :3
Spell-of-Gaming Must be a setting somewhere but I can't find it.
00,02XD
One does not simply play a little bit more Kerbal.
I procastinate too much, and it's apparently "killing" my studies
dat fuel line
Spell-of-Gaming: Actually, procrastination is a very common thing, and it has a perfectly reasonable explanation.
I'm wondering if I have ADHD
lol 8 bit music ftw
Spell-of-Gaming: Doubt it. However, if you got some local egghead to block dopamine receptors in your brain, you'd just work and work.
And we get splosion.
00,02i need landing gear
FairysHuff Test
Í just dont know what went wrong..
00,02not sure how to make it work
only way I know to land on a standard rocket is the .13 munar lander method
might work with lander legs, just haven't tried it
FairysHuff Test
mount tricouplers as low as they can go, then mount the legs (or wings) to the very bottom of those
er... side decouplers I mean.
uh... that won't work
both gear are operated by the same key.
hen3ry: It's funny how your name rolls off my tongue. I call you Henery
actually, the 3 is silent. :D
hen3ry: I know.
00,02screw physics
00,02i'm Phase4
Phase4: That's the spirit!
physics isn't the problem here mate, it's the landing control.
hit G.
You can join NASA with that
wheels go up as legs go down
FairysHuff test
00,02hen3ry, watch
FairysHuff: Test
FairysHufftest
grrrrrrrrrr
?
00,02ok, probably cant see it on stream
Phase4: They're floating....
Still trying to get my mIRC client to play a sound when I receive a message.
Aaaand fall.
00,02CrazyCherry, :)
gonna try sommit here
FairysHuff: In the top menu with all the icons should be one saying "Address Book".
Try clicking that and going under "Highlights".
00,02its a hack
00,02but it works
Kammerjunk FOund it but not sure what to do.
FairysHuff: Click "Add" and add your name.
And whatever else you want to ping you.
Well im need to get going now :)
i*
See y'all later :D
Dat song timing.
FairysHuff Test
00,02i sware the gyroscopes have stopped working
FairysHuffTest
good morning everyone :)
Yo everypony
ok, I have a method, it's almost as hackish, but it looks like it should work
Kammerjunk Done. Don't know if it's working though.
Salve, sergio_scriptor et DustyNomad.
00,02i have no controll right now
FairysHuff: Is it?
What?
Phase4: lol
DustyNomad: Hi.
Thats better :P
Kammerjunk *Sigh* No... ~_~
What weird game is this :/
Kammerjunk I'll try again
DustyNomad: Michael Bay: The Game.
DustyNomad: Kerbal space programm
Phase4 favorite game :)
So basicly build a rocket to go to space?
DustyNomad: yep
00,02sergio_scriptor, i'd say so yea
Yes. SPAAAAAAACE
Radial decoupler as low as it will go, attached to another radial decoupler, as low as it will go (floating in air at that point at the base...), with legs mounted to it as low as they'll go... and that gives you enough clearance to land.
...If it doesn't explode beforehand.
00,02DustyNomad, you CAN go to space
Nope
00,02hen3ry, i'm going to make what i think you meen
FairysHuff Test
You got to the moon
I can send you a simple proof of concept
FairysHuff: Tests be testin'.
:)
KammerjunkStill no worky.
Lol
Music changing
FairysHuff: Well, that rustles my jimmies.
I meant the other decoupler type
TMI Anyone know that game?
What game, DustyNomad?
Tales of Monkey Island?
I like Monkey Island.
Kammerjunk It would have helped had I clicked "Enable Highlights" *Double face hoof* ~_~
FairysHuff: Do ho ho.
00,02this should work
That slaps me on the knee.
Idk I forgot it but its a game where you have bowling balls you hit the mouse cat or whatever
Kammerjunk Now it works ^_^ LOL
08,01my eyes are blue
My eyes are red
hitting on the Spice too much?
success!
Looks like that *puts on glasses* didnt work YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
00,02hmmm
Kammerjunk Thanks for the help.
Yup. This is Kerbal Space Program.
Make the rocket spin around. :P
FairysHuff: No problem.
Phase4 GET THAT PONY MUSIC BACK ON NOW...please :<
O.O
My language teacher last grade just become our art teacher this grade. FML
Your ram is ded
dem full HDs
Dem almost full disks.
Consarnit, hen3ry.
I play tf2 diablo 3
DOWNLOAD RAM!
what? Great minds and fools, I say, and I can play either part.
but this laptop sux
actually
My mouse sucks
Why are people celebrating 4th of july though :/
DustyNomad: Because fireworks!
I heard you can download disk drive space. :P
Because it's the 5th?
I really don't know, I don't celebrate it.
You wouldn't download a hard drive!
Whats sop good about 4th july I dont know.
DustyNomad: Independence.
Wooo moosic :3
independance?
It's taken me two days and help from Kammerjunk but I FINALLY have my mIRC client set up ^_^ yay!
What
July 4 is the Independance Day of US, I think. :3
I dont know whats a independance day is
Damnit, Kammerjunk. :3
Wait a second... That Phase4 pony is looking TOWARDS the screen when looking at BronyState. But that means the BronyState screen is mirrored!
Spell-of-Gaming: :D
Yes it is. Because the actual document was signed on July 1-2.
Meh
00,02Kammerjunk, good point
I drank 2 cups of hot chocolate
no wait, I got that wrong.
I need more
Oh hi, Ghostipedia.
MORE HOT CHOCOLATE
the vote was on July 2, the signing was August 2. So of course they picked July 4.
2+2=4
dang I'm getting AdBlocker+
Brb E-Ponys
Yeah, but July 2 is the 183rd day of the year (Not counting leap years), and August 2 is the 214th.
And now I shall sleep for a bit because of medicationies. ^_^ Back in a couple hours.
00,02o i c
183 + 214 = 397.
00,02its detatching them
08,01look at my beautiful blue eyes: http://ompldr.org/vZW5zNw
huh. That wasn't the problem I expected.
08,01Kammerjunk: 2
Ah.
I tend to find lenses can grow annoying if you wear them all day, but that might just be my eyes.
Back E-Ponys
bit of a wobble but...
Boom.
I'm okay with caramel mixed with coffee, but that taste it leaves is just unbearable. :I
(aguy:wb)
Spell-of-Gaming: Really? I love caramel in coffee.
:P
What's even better, though, is mocha.
I LOVE mocha.
08,01the lenses a bit clearer: http://ompldr.org/vZW5zYQ
I believe you called my lander a bit heavy? :D
CARAMEL IN COFFEE? What the heck is wrong with people.
DustyNomad: Hey, it's good!
Caramel in ice cream is better
08,01i'm so excited abotu this cosplay!
08,01i'm spending faaaar too much money on it
cosplay
What
08,01i even got a plush alligator to attach to myself
The concept itself is pretty weird, but once you taste it, oh god so delicious. :3
What
DustyNomad: Yeah, caramel in ice cream is pretty damn awesome.
08,01mm
08,01caramel in icecream
08,01tasty
legs must be slightly off balance.
04I want something sweet to eat now, great, thanks you guys >:I
I eat caramel with ice cream nuts with ice cream vanilla ice cream blablabla
Ghosties: You should totally do that.
08,01Ghosties: pie and icecream
00,02i'ma put that aside for now
00,02code time
08,01sorry, i just ruined you day
but with that much weight, the legs have to be exact I think.
For some reason, I think the rocket counterpart of RCT3 is Kerbal Space Program. :P
Ghosties Poitatos?
probably also another series of them at the outermost point of the triangle
08,01Kammerjunk: yum
Ghosties A pie filled with hot ice cream some caramel and chocolate your favourite chocolate
The combination of cream, jelly and strawberry in that delicious bottom is just splendid.
....
delicious ass?
wat
No, strawberry pie.
So wait, what language is this, Phase4?
I just don't know the english word for pie-bread.
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, java
Hes scripting
00,02more commonly know as bad
bad java, that sounds right.
bad java?
Dahec
00,02looking at ThreadPool.java right now
Hey, Java is alright.
...java rice. /derp
00,02DustyNomad, java sucks
Y?
00,02interesting class
I'd prefer to learn a more platform-centered language, though.
00,02DustyNomad, incredibly verbose, confusing and badly made librarys
00,02slow
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What..
00,02VERY ineficent with memory
I dont get it
DustyNomad: Java. The programming language?
00,02i dont think the language itself is the problem
Phase4: You remind me of my 'friend'
Wut it isnt programming its for minecraft :P
00,02i think its programers suck
the tradeoffs they made to make it "universal" are an issue.
And yet, for some reason, Java still manages to create awesome games. :I
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, well theres minecraft
00,02thats the only thing in java thats worth it
hen3ry: I agree. The only reason I want Java is because I just got an Android.
00,02wish they chose a different language for android
00,02surely they could have used .net
00,02much better vm
00,02this class is strange and confusing, why does it need to exist
I used to do C and Perl coding, still occasionally will do stuff with it. But I don't touch java.
Android is can be pretty dangerous for someone who just wants a smartphone, after all, it's pretty open-source.
I want a hammer to destroy my galaxy tab. It cant delete images it Cant delete history When I'm watching videos I manage to press the Youtube Button and the other buttons and its a pile of shit
00,02its a superclass of Thread, and does basicaly nothing but track thread creation
Spell-of-Gaming: It can be pretty dangerous for anyone without common sense.
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, i dont see why that makes it dangerous
Open source is everybody's business.
00,02DustyNomad, odd, i can do all those things on my phone
Android is basically a stripped and heavily modified linux, isn't it?
No its a galaxy tab
00,02hen3ry, the kernel is modified linux
you know like a ipad
00,02DustyNomad, yes. an android tablet
00,02the core os is 90% the same
An iPad is WAY DIFFERENT from a Galaxy TAb.
Yea
a galax tab tbhats big as a ipad
00,02the only real difference is the ui
...That, and it's not Apple.
Actually, a Galaxy Tab is pretty small
Actually there are types
Small nd ipad size
Piece of shit.
GIVE ME A AXE
DAMMIT
Twilight? Get mah rope.
all I have is a plastic sword, will that do?
That is the best badass AJ line in the entire series.
A PLASTIC SWORD? Obvious kid
DustyNomad: I don't have an axe, but I do have a rusty iron pipe I once poked myself in the eye with.
Will that do?
SURE
*destroys the galaxy tab then dies because it exploded*
DustyNomad: Post that to /r/Android and see how much will you be downvoted to Oblivion.
Lol
Its a piece of shit
I have never used Reddit.
apparently I'm getting a hand-me-down iPad this month. Never used an iPad before.
00,02what i want to do is catch exceptions and post them somewhere
00,02getting all sorts of strange behaviour and cant reproduce some of it
Ok you can delte history but you cant delete pictures.
Scribblenauts Remix is pretty much one of the few best games on an iOS.
I used to know how to do that in C. Won't help with java tho :/
00,02DustyNomad, it realy needs a proper file manager, theres none intergrated into android but esFileManager is fairly good
00,02hen3ry, in c you handle sigsegv (on linux, something similar on windows or its exception whatnots)
of course, my C code was a disaster... bits of borrowed bad idea code from elsewhere too...
Okay, guys: Suddenly, your uncle/grandfather/whatever dies and leaves you with more money that you could possibly spend in your lifetime. Do you quit your job?
I can't wait until Scribblenauts Unlimited for Windows, though.
00,02in this you have a listener class thing, not sure exactly how to use it though
Guys I'm gonna go attempt to make a minecraft ore
Kbsi
00,02Kammerjunk, depends, if i enjoy my job then no
Kbai E-pony
like the anti-crash code I borrowed... which essentially copied everything in memory to a crash file, suspended user input, finished crashing, rebooted itself, then reloaded the memory. Nevermind the active memory was probably what crashed the damn thing in the first place.
00,02given that i could never have a job i dont enjoy, i'd do it
00,02hen3ry, that
What mods should I upload in my minecraft?
00,02wow
00,02hen3ry, that is scary
yes, it is.
I kinda like waking up every morning on schedule and working a set period of time. Choices are confusing.
and that was for a chat program... multi user environment.
00,02hen3ry, thats evil, NEVER do that
I know better. _now_
MinecraftCherry: What mods do you have? :3
Spell-of-Gaming: Single player commands and toomanyitems so far...
what you guys talking about?
00,02wait
TooManyItems is way too useful.
00,02dafaq
Spell-of-Gaming: I just thought of Tkkit.
Tekkit*
I dunno,it's just more enjoyable than Creative mode.
ALL the innuendos!
what song is this guys? and hi everypony :)
Salve, ninja_pony et Darkts3|Drawing|MLG.
MinecraftCherry: I recommend Minecraft Comes To Life, if you like simulation games like Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing
Et ave, Invi.
00,02this code
00,02the crap
00,02i dont see how this works
harvest moon was awesome
00,02it seems to restart EVERY running thread each time you start a new one
played that for days
Yeah, I absolutely LOVE having to wait for something in real-time.
lol agreed
it's java. that might actually be what it's doing...
Also, "I can scare the shit out of my neighbour in 10 seconds flat."
That sounds like a challenge to me.
doesn't it have to launch client-side most of those threads?
at least the UI
imm bored can anyone reccomand an awesome rts or a game like harvestmoon?
00,02ThreadPool athreadpool[] = new ThreadPool[i + Math.min(Math.max((int) ((double) i * 0.40000000000000002D), 1), 100)];
00,02i dont even
yeah...
00,02every now and again
00,02i look at this code
create an array of threadpools of the minimum of the maximum of... magic.
00,02see breif flashes of logic
Oh hey, I only have 110 tabs open!
00,02then i look closer and see more crap
00,02:'(
I used to have like, 150.
so who is responsible for the abomination?
00,02hen3ry, 'shi-chan'
00,02its a decompile of the paintchat
huh. Never trust code from a -chan. Insist on at least a -kun, preferably a -san.
00,02figured it'd be ok sense shi-chan has more or less not existed sense 2003
00,02XD
I look at that code, Phase4, and I try to comprehend it, but I can't
I just can't.
00,02it could be worse
00,02we could be looking at M.java
Fair 'nuff.
I'm still trying to conceptualize it based on how I'd write it if I had to.
server side holds the "chat" and the "canvas," and everything else is client side, I'd guess.
00,02int i6 = ai2[3] << 24 | ai2[2] / k5 << 16 | ai2[1] / k5 << 8 | ai2[0] / k5;
bitshifting.
00,02return i1 << 24 | j1 + (int)((float)((j >>> 16 & 0xff) - j1) * f) << 16 | k1 + (int)((float)((j >>> 8 & 0xff) - k1) * f) << 8 | l1 + (int)((float)((j & 0xff) - l1) * f);
... fuck it, we'll do it live.
00,02lets not forget the abuse of the ? opperator
00,023.8k lines of obfuscated java
phase4
yeah. I'm guessing all of those have to do with the canvas part, but still, that's... that's not code, that's a code's abortion.
dat code wall
Phase4: l4d2?
00,02hen3ry, plus theres unused variables and functions in the code
This coding is scary.
00,02which meens the compiler didnt optimize them out
00,02which meens thats not far from the original code
of course there's unused variables and functions, the programmer couldn't have possibly kept track of them all
00,02yeah, but they should be optimized away
the complexity of the chat is overwhelming
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: you mean too damn high
Java isn't my cup of tea, I'm afraid. I've never even tried to hello world with it.
fuck off youtube i do have rights to post MY FUCKING OWN MUSIC I MAKE
silly youtube
my crazy chat program at least used multiple source code files, and each one had a logical section of what the overall program was doing.
the amount of chaos in this java is too damn high
00,02my god
00,02hen3ry, shi-chan is secredly discord D:
I'm not sure about that, but shi-chan may well have been stoned
00,02tool = (ToolBox)Class.forName("paintchat." + s2 + ".Tools").newInstance();
00,02this software has a habbit of dynamicly invoking via class names
honestly it's sounding at this point more like a rewrite from scratch than a patch job.
yup
Crash?
honestly it's sounding at this point more like a rewrite from scratch than a patch job.
00,02internet death
Silly Internet.
00,02hen3ry, yeah, been thinking of that
also, fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-.
My tablet is model 504. The company renamed everything, and there is a model 504 of three different types now... each requiring a different driver.
00,02dats better
00,02stream working?
yeah streams up
00,02only on the second set of tanks
00,02this will go well
Still exploring the final frontier I see.

Bye guys.... I may be on later
00,02hmm
00,02theres something on the moon
00,02i might go have a look at it when i manage a lunar rovar
00,02rover'
supposedly an "arch" there.
plus all your debris of course.
00,02two minutes till perapsis
00,02hen3ry, that too
Phase4: whats if it is luna her self
00,02:D
you might not have an actual perapsis... I've landed at altitudes that high.
That would be awesome
00,02dis is a little close
00,022.8k
nevermind killing off hundreds of m/s of lateral velocity.
00,02i think thats a mountoune therei
00,02i cant spell

00,02hit space
00,02well
00,02nvm then
00,02once more with tri
00,02or program
00,02hmmm
00,02who's still here?
yo
what?
Decided I'll try landing it your style before bed, see if I can actually manage it.
dat VioletGreySha :3
Invi|room_cleaning: oh u ;3
I am looking at the list of people that will be at Comi Con
Comic
/me huggles VioletGreySha :3
00,02hen3ry, its hard
00,02i've managed a few landings
it looks hard.
00,02though i think its the controlls more than anything
I'm pretty sure my way is easier, even if it does burn way more fuel and take a long time.
00,02absolute pain
/me hugs Invi|room_cleaning back :3
Phase4: Crash in to the moon like a boss
00,02cow334, k

00,02tri is my favorite design
00,02bout the same as quad, but two instead of three outer boosters

Did mr silence die?
hi RX-78-SweetieBot
00,02stupid orbit
00,02i sware the rockets got less powerfull
Phase4: Dumb orbit...
Phase4 gravity maybe just got stronger :D
00,02ders the intercept
I got hungry. So I went downstairs and made a Sandvich.
Dat Higgs Boson
00,02cow334, i'd rather try land
00,02probably gona hit the moon anyway
00,02after this back to java or bed

ohai CCCP :)
hi
i found some neat trixie pics for you
although you may have already seen them
twilight_sprinkle: oh cool :D
User0 is dat Higgs Boson actually confirmed as legit?

Invi|room_cleaning: almost... almost...
User0 and that almost is exactly the point.
Invi|room_cleaning: "Scientists say the newly discovered particle mostly matches the description of the fabled Higgs boson, although more data is needed."
00,02like an arrow
twilight_sprinkle NIce! i actually havn't seen that before
00,02hen3ry, about to try land
CCCP: trying to link a few more but inet is being screwy
twilight_sprinkle: Fanon Trixie is awesome.
User0 i know the likelyhood is about 99.99994% but that is not confirmed
Kammerjunk: fanon? wut means?
twilight_sprinkle: awww
that looks more like one of my typical approaches. 16km up and zero momentum except on the z axis
twilight_sprinkle: Well, Trixie isn't a very developed character in the show. That leaves room for so much. For example, my personal headcanon is that Trixie just wants to be famous, by any means necessary.
Invi|room_cleaning: Phase4 might be adding more data to the research with his gravity research
00,02XD
:D
Kammerjunk: ah i see

hen3ry: and another 3 kerbals are slain...
good thing we got plenty more
hen3ry: indeed
User0: its probably the same 3 kerbals, but their souls are imprisoned for testing and they just get reborn in new bodies readied for them
actually my kerbals have a decent survival rate... if the launchpad doesn't get em, they usually land safely

Wow
This is actually so nice
I can't remember the last time BronyState was as quiet as this

Hai Lil_B
Lil_B: It's going good? D:
Hello whoever entered the stream :)
dont i get a hi
08,01i just spent the whole morning playing amateur chemist to try and make my hair smell like cotton candy, while moisturising it so it won't frizz up
Hello TheKoreanBrony1354
:D
Vordox yes, clothes are done (except the ... shoes?... on his front legs, I still can't get the hair right tho
The hair is a pain told ya :P
08,01i also found an odourless deoderant
00,02seems everything still works
08,01and i'm going to apply vanilla and almost essence to my skin and clothes
08,01to make me smell like a bakery
00,02but it should bug me when there are uncaught exceptions
Vordox no, I told you the hair is har, you told me the clothes are hard, but they were easy XD
08,01i was looking through my drawers for vanilla essence, and i came accross the almost
08,01and i thought "i wonder what this smells li-- HOLY COW YES"
Lil_B: The cloth was easy. :P
00,02now i just need to trigger an excaption
how do you make the live stream text in a small square
08,01i was also speaking to my brother, who used to be a biochemist, and knows how to make esters (artificial scents)
Vordox I'm gonna give you the link to the newest version :)
08,01Phase4: i did
00,02:)

so. What the heck is the person streaming streaming?
DrHobo: code
User0: code for what?
DrHobo: If I'm not mistaken, Phase4 is streaming himself cleaning up code.
DrHobo: paintchat
User0: oh
I haz glostick axe dB
08,01Honeybadger: a bit
Alright, I'll wait then ;)
anyone hear listen to superpony beat
busy
sorry ^_^
00,02thing is uncaught exceptions normaly kill the vm
00,02so theres none to test this
00,02and eclipse has this horrible habit of detecting that scenario
your not there yet
keep up the good work
00,02which is excelent, but it wont let you compile if that scenario is detected
sounds like java?
who hear likes dub step
how was everypony's 4th of july? (if you're in the US :u)
terrific
in that case its actually the java compiler that detects uncaught checked exceptions
DrHobo I only saw one fireworks display and didn't shoot any off

so, Phase4, your streaming dB
08,01okay, i think i've got the proportions right
08,01i'm using jojoba oil, honey, and strawberry flavouring
08,01this is in my hair
so anywho
HIYA EVERYPONY
08,01and maybe some egg white for hold
hi Bronysith
Gracie showed up in my town today - glitched when I tried to talk to her after getting the letter, none of the buttons worked - couldnt enter a house, or save - Resetti was MAD
08,01though then my hair will smell of egg
08,01and i don't want that
/me is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
08,01hmm
08,01i might put some egg white in an atomiser
08,01and spray it in as my hair dries
08,01actually, no
08,01i know what
08,01i'll comb it in, then atomise some more of the jojoba stuff on top
08,01to get rid of the smell
08,01i'll need to try this when when i'm home from work
I wish Resetti could tell the difference between purposfully not saving & the battery going out or a glitch like I just had
oh, god, I just hic-upped and burped at the same time .-.
It urt
ohai everypony

pretty accurate description http://derpy.me/eYuQD
User0 i intend to hide mine
What happens when you get resetti too many times - most I got was around 30 where he makes the screen blackout for a couple minutes
Chrysalis: well, he is trying it out on his own hair first, so I'm not as scared...
08,01MY GOD I JUST REALISED I DON'T HAVE ANY PARTY STREAMERS
WHAT
yeah, but i put alot of effort into my hair, eggwhite would kind of undo that
/me 08,01is actually turning into pinkie pie
Ha ha. Putting effort into hair.
I just let it grow and then get it shaved when it gets too long.
Streamers is a must for any dress
bet*
woo having to buy 3 damn packs of red hair dye
MFW i eat the food
And who know? Maybe in the years to come, we'll be able to change our hair colour via DNA.
Kammerjunk unlikely
08,01Kammerjunk: we can already do that

So, I bought Arma 2 only because I want to play the DayZ mod
hey guys
Hai alexxm
hey Jim how have you been
Sleepy ^^
00,02uncaught exceptions are not being caught by the uncaught exception handler
00,02theres reasons i hate java
Jim: I think that's the only reason anyone buys it.
Phase4: I'll try to look into that later
00,02User0, this is code i've just added
Phase4: what kind of exception?
Phase4: After spending all day writing code at work (and being distracted by bronystate), coding becomes a little less exciting...
00,02shana, null pointer
00,02its the only one eclipse wont yell at me for
hi everypony!
hey look, paintchat works dB bye
I wonder if there is an Eclipse pony.
hi LoGaN
Phase4: nullpointer exception is an unchecked exception, so the java compiler does not complain
hey LoGaN hows your day been
LoGaN: Indeed
i just woke up alexxm
Indeed
LoGaN well did you sleep well?
00,02i'm doing what this example does
yes?... stalker
Oh you guys... http://i.imgur.com/wfG7I.jpg
Phase4: hard to see code in stream due to low resolution
So I wanted to find an Eclipse pony. I found this instead: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t3KQjVPpLmU/T7lrFbBo2_I/AAAAAAAAAdQ/_acLEOjYYHE/s1600/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-solar-eclipse.jpg
Phase4: maybe nopaste the relevant part so I can have a look at it?
LoGaN: where did you find that Monocle face?
Bronysith: That looks pretty neat. The way Twilight is looking at Celestia, though, throws my mind in the gutter.
someone showed it to me i think it was crazycherry
00,02shana, i'ma try something else
Bronysith: thats cute
LoGaN: oh
guys i gotta work soon were setting up for the loht olympics
LoGaN: You're helping set up?
yeah
LoGaN: :o Good man
6_9
duh
loht = london?
derp derp derpy hooves
derpin around
Oh hey, I just found out I still have the image of Meanwhile confessing his love for Trixie. Huh, I didn't know I saved that.
Kammerjunk: Can't believe I tabbed out of LoL to read that.
Oh hi, Meanwhile.
Kammerjunk: Who is best hero?
no its my poppys last name and every year he invites the whole family and lots of friends to play games at his house its set up like the olympics but its not the olympics shana
00,02why cant i catch this exception
XAX: Methinks that's the wrong ping.
Phase4: Why can't I hold all of these exceptions?!
00,02^
Phase4: Exceptions - Gotta catch 'em all.
Kammerjunk: Me is tired derp
Phase4: You can't catch it because its just the slipperiest bastard out
oops gtg
bye LoGaN
be back on at lunchtime
bye LoGaN
Phase4: how does your try clause look like?
00,02shana, i'm using setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler
*stands on alexxm 's head*
Phase4: watch out, pointers can be pointy - take safety precausions before handling
00,02explicitly trying to catch uncaught ones
00,02User0, but java has no pointers
User0: Lol
00,02only refferences
java has pointers...
precautions*
00,02shana, it doesnt have pointers
Phase4: why is it called null pointer exception then :)
so what are we watching
00,02shana, i dont actually know, its a null refference exception
Cypresswolf what are you doing on there
Phase4: are you a c++ programmer :)
00,02no clue why they call it null pointer
00,02shana, nope
00,02know a fair bit about c though
Phase4 because when your programming a 0 is known as null
its a reference to how there is nothing there
00,02Chrysalis, yeah, but its not a pointer
yes it is
00,02references != pointers
in java everything is on the heap
00,02there is a pointer somewhere
Phase4 erm thats wrong, references ARE pointers
00,02i dont contest that
just hidden
00,02not in the language
alexxm: :) getting a better view, of course
all the tableflipping
00,02Chrysalis, you could impliment it as an array index
00,02there doesnt need to be a pointer
ok Cypresswolf so what are we watching then
Phase4: you can't do pointer arithmetic in java, but they are still called pointers in java.. pretty sure about that
your using a reference, so your using apointer
00,02besides, you cant defer them
all that changes is the syntax
I'm writing some code for work right now and I have 11 errors and 578 warning...
00,02i cant say access 0x10 in memory
00,02thats what a pointer is
Phase4: that's not true, you defer pointers all the time
at assembly level a reference and a pointer are exactly the same
00,02Chrysalis, no they are not
alexxm: *squints eyes* from what I can tell...a bunch of itty bitty squiggles
00,02a reference is conceptual, it exists at the language and vm level
thanks Cypresswolf
/me goes to check is java references are different from the C++ references
alexxm: ^_^ Your Welcome!
cause in c++ they are definately the same
00,02c++ has pointers
and c#/java everything is on the heap, and you have to use pointers for those
00,02the closest example of a reference in c++ is smart pointers
00,02and c# has a stack
00,02makes it a crapton faster than java
alexxm: watching Phase fix code for the paintchat :)
Phase4 Hey. Just though you may like to know that OUTCAST the 1999 pc game is on sale on GOG.com I just bought it.
thanks Cypresswolf what excuality was the paint chat
http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/141834/how-is-a-java-reference-different-from-a-c-pointer
Phase4: anyway, are you setting the exception handler on the right thread?
FairysHuff|Sleep: Oh hi :)
00,02dat is an old game
00,02shana, the default handler is for the entire vm
killerpony7733 Hallo. I just woke.
a java reference is a pointer but with compiler enforced type checking
alexxm: little place where you could draw pictures with others. never used it as it wouldnt work for me
same as c++ references
FairysHuff|Sleep: I woke up like 2 hours ago :P
00,02shana, http://derpy.me/X0G71
same here Cypresswolf i tried to see what it was when we first got the new format and it wouldn't work for me
killerpony7733 I woke, took my meds, 2 hours later I sleep again. And then I wake to buy OUTCAST ^_^
00,02outcast looks old old
00,02but very polished for its time
00,02infact i'd gues this is 2002 by the design
FairysHuff|Sleep: Thats good :)
Phase4: that doesn't set the exception handler for the vm...
Phase4: play nethack~
00,02at least 2002
00,02shana, ok, whats it do?
Phase4 It was ahead of its time. For the time that is ^_^ And was very well received. And for £1.39 more than worth the sale price
Phase4: it sets the exception handler for the thread that is spawned when you run it
killerpony7733 How are you?
00,02"This handler is invoked in case any Thread dies due to an unhandled exception."
FairysHuff: Good good slept as much as i could i was litterally exhausted last night
so what sort of game is outcast
killerpony7733 Why exhausted?
00,02shana, its a static function
alexxm I would explain but it would take too long. Just go to GOG.com
FairysHuff: All my energy just dropped to dead zero while i was attending someones birthday, i just began feeling sleepy and exhausted
Phase4: static functions can operate on thread local stuff iirc
thanks FairysHuff
Phase4: you should also have a Thread.getID or something static method
killerpony7733 Yeh. I get that a lot.
00,02interesting
00,02shana, you see thats what i was doiung
00,02doing'
00,02this uses ThreadGroup instead of Thread
00,02that wasnt working, so i'm trying to set the vm wide handler
morning everypony :)
I was going to play OUTCAST but I think I'll save it for making a blind let's play with. Will be more amusing that way.
why is stream about statics?
hi cachi01

hi Bronysith and CCCP =D
User0 Nethack?

cachi01: wrong pic though
00,02shana, you sure static can be thread local?
Bronysith: they laugh at my misery!
00,02google is telling me otherwise
FairysHuff: http://thegreatestgameyouwilleverplay.com/
Phase4: yeah, look at Thread.sleep or so.. but I noticed there is a setDefaultUncaught.. and a setUncaucht...
00,02http://codingclues.eu/2008/catching-exceptions-with-an-uncaughtexceptionhandler-in-java/
00,02everything i'm seeing says this is suposed to be global
cachi01: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6o2ybklzY1r3xauuo1_1280.png
Phase4: yeah you're right
Bronysith, In before everything goes wrong....o_O
oh hey TheRainbowDash
Bronysith: XDDD
00,02then why isnt it being invoked
Phase4: you said it uses a ThreadGroup?
molestia is my waifu
Bronysith: thats kinda funny yah
Phase4: does it override the uncaughtException() method?
00,02nope
Phase4: hmm..
00,02oh
00,02ThreadPool
now i want chocolate
hello
00,02ThreadGroup is the one in java

my logic senses are failing
/me fires a party cannon into the chat.

Entire team is babies.
PFFT THAT TIM FURTRAS 2 GEIM IS A COD CUPY DEAUGHGG
no it isnt
Gooby pls
sonicandmario05 he's taking the piss out of cod fans
Radu pls
As he rightfully should.
TF2 is made by valve which are the creators of steam :P
Indeed.
sonicandmario85: you dont say
Pfft, CoD games are good
Valve is controlled by GAY BEN
IMO yes they are good
Pfft, Disagree
also its 85 not 05
but there are some fanboys
That's why I will NEVER touch cod if I ever get an Xbox.
that say bullshit like tf2 being a copy of COD and that halo isjust COD in the fututre and shit like that
CoD is a copy of Quake
Or Unreal, whichever came first
Quake came before Unreal. I think.
Every game is 'copy' of some other game
Quake 3
which came first MoH or CoD?
Well yeah, there are no original ideas. Anywhere.
my first FPS was MoH rising sun
Meanwhile: Well, what is the Spyro trilogy for the PS1 a copy of?
Chrysalis: A copy of table tennis

Table tennis is a copy of tennis

Very_Silly_Filly: xd

AttackPony: Riding an exercise bike
AttackPony:riding a car XD
But then, what's a copy of just doing nothing?
inb4 being dead
AttackPony: ...
Aliens
Very_Silly_Filly: You sure it's aliens? You're not one of them, are you?
Very_Silly_Filly is best alien.
I am a British Alien
:alienguy: Very_Silly_Fillys
Ponies
WE'RE ALL ALIENS. This is now fact.
I WANNA BE XENOMORPH!
bronies are best aliens
I wanna be an Andalite.
Now that AttackPony has said it, it must be canon.
cachi01 it can be arranged that you'll host one
Cricket is a copy of throwing your rubber at some pencils you've stood up on their ends while someone else tries to hit it with their text book
Smashing^
alexxm: oh shit!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8t17iGqgc

AttacktheAndalite: It's good.
roblox and minecraft ftw...
FlyingShoppingCart: Oh, there is one thing more dangerous than you
Really? What?
Meanwhile: I'll watch it later since I have class in almost an hour and a half from now
FlyingShoppingCart: Yeerks.
Doooorks.
Shaddap Kevin
AttacktheAndalite: don't die, dying is bad
Not the yeerks! They're my arch nemesis since childhood!!
User0: I'm not dying....who said I was?
FlyingShoppingCart: Oh god YES! *brohoofs as well as an Andalite can*

Of course, there would have to be a way for the gun to activate the chainsaw bullets.
Aximili-Esgarrouth-Ishtill. Holy fuck, how do I still remember how to spell that?

Oh gosh, steam sales soon
AttacktheAndalite: Excellent!
Jim: It's accurate :d
Holla everypony! :)
Hello GilDash
/me glomps GilDash
jeu
Dat GilDash.^^
dat GilDash
AttacktheAndalite: Andalite? Sounds familiar. :S
hey GilDash hows your day been
howdy, GilDash! :)
GilDash: Animooorphs! FUCK YEAH!
AttacktheAndalite: I knew it. :)
Stargate, Ubisoft, Sparkle.Fade in to the left handof a sleepy man.How'd he fall asleep there?
GilDash: Hi gildy :)
GilDash: Ax is best socially awkward.
Help up the sleepy hooded man.That's what beds are for.Drag him cross the stone floor.
GilDash: aaaaand he's adorable as a human**
AttacktheAndalite: Indeed he is. :D
/me hugs you all.
Front shot then a shot from the ceiling.He could get carpet burned.Slow fade.
http://fav.me/d566q6x
Cut to white on a boat, I'm looking ahead.Holding on a rope.I am... nauseous,
GilDash: If he wern't an alien....hell, even in his natural form....NO, bad thoughts Attack! Aliens and humans do not....
this vid is so much win http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjdmYPvEQac
AttacktheAndalite: I'm sure he could morph. ;)
Nothing is quite as sad as watching a dude light a firework when it's stuck down his pants.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJjJY5YpKRI
Meanwhile: Or funny when he runs around screaming. :D
GilDash: Indeed.
Meanwhile: Or lodged in his ass.
/me glomps GilDash ontop of Meanwhile
/me did not ask for this.
GilDash: I meant a human and an Andalite in his natural form....
AttacktheAndalite: Well... don't tell him it's taboo and he might just fall for it. ;)
GilDash: GilDash: But it IS possible because Elfangor was Tobias' dad and he was an Andalite in a human morph, and his mom is human.
AttacktheAndalite: I'm struggling to see a problem here... ;)
/me watches The Newsroom to see what all the fuss is about.
ohai, bronystate
Tovler what happened
Hi Tovler
hey Tovler hows your day been
GilDash: So am I, excep the fact that you can't "surprise" an Andalite from behind because the eyes on the top of their heads turn 180 degrees
00,10ma god, almost an hour in to this scan and it's still on C drive.
Tovler: Holla! :)
AttacktheAndalite: Well, don't surprise him. Get to know him. :)
Sumica: How much space do you have on your C drive?
Sumica: want me to smash something? rivel?
It was yet another beautiful day of underemployment.
Sumica there is a reason i leave mine overnight, a full scan takes nearly 6 hours
Scan ALL the things.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3kcvKd7mXE (dang it NASA, get me to the Moon with Frank and Woona!)
*holds up gun to head* im sooooooooooooooooooooo bored
pwnie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6XLwIZCIQA
*pew*
Wow, I feel wierd now
I can complete a scan in like 1 hour :S
00,10C is 500gig, E: is 1tera, F: is 1tera P: is 8terra
GilDash: Aww, so no one-nighters? Dang. Well, at least Visser Three...no, that wouldn't be a good idea I don't think
:O awesome!
8terra :O
NICE
AttacktheAndalite: That would be a *terrible* idea. :D
600 Gb hard drive
Yet my PC is kinda old, do you lot have pretty much full to the Gunnels HD?
GilDash: Well there IS a fic of Visser Three and a human....'
00,10I think part of the problem is I never clearend my windows.old
my hard drive is 2 TB
lololo
I need a new computer
Mine's only 1 TB. :/
AttacktheAndalite: I'm not sure I want to know. Andalites are one thing, but yergs... :D
1Gb ram nowadays isn't good enough
00,103 of them are
/me gives Meanwhile 2 TB
AttacktheAndalite: Or was it yerks? I get confused.
lolziez http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jC8JIjW2cw
GilDash: I know EXACTLY where to find said fic
Processor = fine, GPU = fine
RAM = bullparp
AttacktheAndalite: Good job I'm far too busy to read it then. :D
GilDash: Yeerks. they can infest ANYTHING, human or not
valoreins: and a kid getting punched in the hand
>mfw a fandom I'm not apart of explodes in rage.
/me licks cachi01
00,10So you all looking forward to the movies?
ewww lol
Sumica: yes
Sumica of course :D
WHOS READY for the steam sales?
What are they?
AttacktheAndalite: That's why I'd stay very *very* dar away. :D
Arma 2, why you take so long to load?
Bronysith no wallet is ever ready for those
00,10got some great ones for BMN this week.
I'm home this weekend so I'm actually able to watch them
Bronysith: I sure am!
9.1 download
Grr, speed up!
00,10and then we double up on trilogys next week.
I'm still happy I found an A movie I could settle on.
what trilogy?
playing bronified songs in Rock Band 3 is awesone
Bronysith: Say, if Arma 2 gets on sale, wanna get it and play DayZ with me?
awesome¡
Back to the future? Naked gun?
But man, I've seen El Dorado to death.
Jim: maybe
We had Naked Gun already
Jim: Dayz looks fun but annoying
Indeed
Tov|Newsroom: its so awesome!
Ahh did we? I was away
The very idea of permadeath is neat
Gutted,
GilDash: An upside to having a Yeerk is if you had a crappy life, you can join them and you know, not be all evil and stuff. Like Mr. Chapman
Jim: i hope the half life colleciton goes on sale
I can already see the chat erupting when they learn the girl's name is Chell.
I bet it's the kind of game that is better to play with more people
What are we watching then? :S
Inb4 "why can she talk? :I"
i think imma play some deus ex
Very_Silly_Filly the abyss of my mothers soul
Road to El Dorado and Robin Hood Men in Tights I think are the movie night ones.
Not heard of it, what's it got?
AttacktheAndalite: I actually had a teacher called Mr. Chapman. :D
As you probably should know by now, I can't take CGI blood
men in tights.... oh my...
GilDash: He didn't have an alien in his head, did he?
/me licks valoreins
inb4 "Did that horse just talk?"
/me licks back Bronysith
AttacktheAndalite: Not as far as I'm aware, no. I did have the sense not to ask too hard though. :D
"Ooh, you grown a nice pair of boobs robin while you were gone" = my favourite line when he's feeling up a statue
GilDash: Define "ask too hard"
Dammit. went to sleep at noon, woke up now... I hate it when a whole day wastes away...
hi everyone!
Dat Alchemist.^^
hi Alchemist
*silence*
Allo Alchemist.
hi Alchemist"
hey Alchemist hows your day bene
!
Oh and btw, hai
AttacktheAndalite: Well... I wouldn't want to draw attention to myself, would I? ;)
GilDash: True but he WOULD know if he knew in a way, judging by how you act. Can't Yeerks also read other people's minds?
alexxm: its been great. I passed my last exam in this semseter today :)
AttacktheAndalite: ... I'm not sure I like where this is going... :$
good to hear Alchemist hope it went well
GilDash: It's not going THERE, if you must know. I know that Yeerks can tell you shit and control you. Not all are bad, though.
I've been up whole night studying for it, thats why I came home and slept through the whole day, which sucks. But, oh well.
GilDash doesn't like where something is going. The world must be ending.
Ikr?
AttacktheAndalite: I'd just rather stay the hell away... much safer. :)
Meanwhile, Well, there goes CloudsDale...o_O
well if you did well Alchemist you deserve the rest
Meanwhile: Slugs. Big, fat, brain slugs.
Oh, they're gonn'to have to glue you back together... IN HELL!
Dat FlareChaser.^^
Meanwhile: They also control your every action, including what you say.
GilDash: I think brain slugs are cute :D

00,10I would totaly put up with Vegas fry an egg hot over humidity any day
Well, the default answer is that everyone WOULD mind if I speak out on it.
Yeah well you say that pretty much every day.
The suspense of what you actually want to say has been killing me for weeks.
Really.
I've honestly been rather idle lately.
who wants to see a clown that could beat the crap out of you
Kandarihu: I know that feel, bro
I would like to see that
alexxm: me?
alexxm: It's bad enough seeing regular clowns.
00,10did't you already post that alexxm?

I'm halfway to a clown myself... only halfway - the pinkie pie half...
I've developed a reputation for complaining about everything, since that time that a lot of stuff that I found offensive was streamed in a short period of time.
User0, o_O.....uhh, Im'a just go over there.
13i am not putting on a clown costume..
alexxm: wut... the ...fu**
BUCK YEAH PINKIE PIE
Shizu, come on, do it for us.^^
And then there was that issue with Magicka that pushed it over the line.
13no :<
Shizuka: same here... that's why I'm the PP half... I don't dress the part
:<
Kandarihu: You've got a reputation for saying you would complain but you don't want people to take issue with it.
You're like the champion of being passive agressive.
Passive aggressive? It dat even a thing?o.O
OneTrickPony you said you wanted to see it
passive agressive? HCJVLAFJÑFERCDA
alexxm: it actually got kinda funny
Guess that became and old person saying while I wasn't looking.

OneTrickPony how did it get funny
I RETURN! With a full belly and a memory like a seive. O_o
alexxm: cause he's beating the crap out of everyone

Sumica: Should it not be a Kerbal on fire? :P
Sumica I don't have a cutie mark and don't know what it would be.
Sumica: is that taken by Phase4?
Sumica: i thought its a mutilated kerbal
FairysHuff: same here
Sumica: or a picture of rivel

What is Syndicate?
IS IT A GAME?
MasterBoss43: It's like Deus Ex but not.
WHAT IS IT?
yes, it's a game
13it is a fruit
TELLLLLLL MEEEEEE!
sonicandmario85, Errr, yesh, it is.
FairysHuff: Syndicate as in the old one? :)
sonicandmario85: Less caps lock
MasterBoss43 Think of it as a top down strategy Deus Ex
Meanwhile in tokyo, Chi chu chan chong?
Syndicate by of Shizu's logic is an apple.
Is Syndicate an instrument?
GilDash Yeh. I bought it on GOG.com ages ago
No Jim Syndicate is not an instrument.
Jim: fair enough
/me raises hand
FairysHuff: I really could do with getting some more things off of GOG. :)
Meanwhile, Err....I got the horse radish, but I decided to put dat away.o_O
no Jim syndicate is not mayonnaise
sumica theres some kerbals wanting to be slaughterd by you xD
00,10soon
GilDash I bought quite a few games from it. Dungeon Keeper 2 being another.

alexxm: How did that go?
The game is still in alpha?
brony_boy115 It's too short though
but you can pay 1$ now and it will count towards the 15$. So if you decide you want the game when it's out, you can pay the remaining 14$
00,10I dont think I am gonna be able to slow this one down

Seriously?
Nyst tv show
They're atually making a Mass Effect film?
Oh, I thought it was the stargate movie from the look of it.
Nah. The movie had Kurt Russel, not MacGuyver.

They were making a Stargate MMO but the games company went under.

also, they use this in atlantis
Man he looks so different. He really went from nerdy archeologist to chiseled jaw actionhero over the years.

That all makes sense to me. Relatively simple.

How trollish would it be to put the stargate horizontally instead of vertically, so that as soon as you went through, gravity causes you to fall back through it and killed?

00,10it dont stop the wormhole
/me stops a wormhole with titanium.
what now?
00,10it stops people from coming out the wormhole
Yeah I know, but if the gate works like it does in the movie, it shouldn't kill them either.
ഃ
Iris closed = people and things go splat
Since there's this watery like waiting room kind of thing.
it stops all matter from materialising
/me noms on Meanwhile
00,10oh the matter materialises.
00,10as a smear on teh back side of the gate
/me noms panda
/me noms on Chrysalis
oh yeah, it doesnt stopit materialising, it stops reintegration
just send a nuke through the portal... that will end well
so the matter can't form back into whatever it was before
/me has been trout-ed.
um. pinkie pie. what? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5626/
So what happens...When you get two stargates, dial the other on one, then send one of the stargates through the other.
Mind = Blown
Sure you can
also, it would be impossible
then a black hole is formed
you need to be in orbit or on a planet for the gates to connect
00,10what I want to know though is what happens if you try to go in to an inbound wormhole.
Hello
and 2 gates cannot maintain a connection in orbit around the same plane
one overrides the other
Sumica: ask pinkie pie
So you dial them when the two are far away
he was their king
00,10that was one bit they never covered.
Then send one to the other while keeping the connection open
and they lose connection once they leave orbit
Sumica they did didnt they, its suicide
What movie is this?
Bullshit
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/835/
00,10no i meen if the gate is open already
cause when a gate gets stolen a criminal suicides by throwing themselves into an inbound gate
what happens if a gate inploded
am i missing something what happened to his wifes kid
they can't
00,10I thought it was a gate that was opening
00,10as in the big fooooosh thing
A BLACK HOLE IS FORMED
i forgot what they called that
they gave it a proper name
Sooo many questions. All answered in the show. Buy the DVD box set everypony ^_^
ah hell.....
00,10O'neals kid shot himself in the head using oneals service pistol
How about we take all of these problems, and given them to Pinkie pie...
thanks Sumica

How shit are their computers?

00,10apple IIE
Lawl
not easy shit
Also, this show is from year 2000.
Chrysalis, it's simple
Seriously
Get Bill Gates!
moooooop
The way she described it
It should take seconds
To us now, these are 10 year old computers.
00,10altho 2-3 a month would be around one a week
thous the UNSC was created
00,10so they could go to a new world each week
:'( why does he have a clay face
you can calculate the interstella drift of multiple constellations
They know the original distance
00,10as if this was a show that came out every friday
and align them to pre-existing systems (which are also moving) to get a target
They know how far away the planets move each year
50,000 * distance
Simple shit
Look at the laptop computer there.
Yeah really
00,10good memory
is that a dell???
so can a stargate be destroyed
Yea. So, which -direction- did the planet move?
as the gravtiy from each system affects the overall movement
dear calesta, please send the aliens to the moon,
00,10yes alexxm
00,10when they blow up they blow up big
how can it be done Sumica
Yes, but you don't need the exact locations
Just a good approximate
anon3mous345: celestia*
Your amateur debates on amateur science amuses Twilight Sparkle. ^_^
oh tkx its hard to spell
00,10the metal in the gate amplifies the effect of a nuke
im back
So?
you can't just fudge something on that scale
00,10not much to fudge
The way she said they were going to do it, it would take seconds
Chrysalis: A smartass could do it with a calculator.
THat's a fact
true
00,10you get close it connects, it dont then you get busy signal
but all nerds do that
cern only just found the higgs partical
Unless she was dumbing it down for the benefit of O'Neal.
Reality is different, but this isn't, so...
that took em what 4/5 years?
l.a.v. yay
Chrysalis: not quite... they're close
berral role
weeeeeee
Do a barrel roll
they also fix the momentum issue with the freezing
when they upgrade the computers
00,10btw, most of this show was filmed in canada
Sumica: i thought it was in equestria
boob time
00,10no Bronysith, but there is a Fic for that.

In regards to the Higgs Boson story I would like to clarify that the scientific team who found it said they "BELIEVE" they "MAY" have found the Higgs Boson. This is science people. It changes all the time. Don't take it for granted.

Fou_Lou this is a series?
But Peter jumped off buildings because he thought he could fly, so he's got stupid covered
