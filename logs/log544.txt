no they aren't
And Korra seems to be doing well too.

So....would that be selfcest?
Thats why its called having "Past Lives"
:D
Wait, does the next Avatar appear after the previous one dies?
Just as every Avatar lived inside Aang
Sort of like the Dalai Lama.
Lemme rephrase that

i hate it when people see lol and think it's wow T.T
it looks...different
2,14 yes, it's LoL
and yes this is LoL
I guys I found Equestria
Its in Praetoria, South Africa
THis has to be a recording, from the webcam inset?
it's still as horrible as last time I played
wut?
05,15Sooo, it's like an RTS?
whats that song in the bg?
2,14 ChaosX is streaming this right now, and I'm restreaming it :P
Well it has it's own genre
2,14 and I keep saying ChaosX like a moron
2,14 Chaox* is TSM's Ranged AD
05,15I have neither heard of MOBAs nor played dota
DT!
Aww they ganking.
2,14 that's how they make money
MOBA standnif for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena
Who's TSM?
well, if no more shows, then cya guys
2,14 they stream their practice matches when not playing on tournaments
2,14 Team Solo Mid
for extended periods of time
2,14 currently the #1 ranked team in the world
Right.
2,14 and my personal favorites
05,15So it's from Warcraft....which means it's an RTS
05,15right?
Well it's not
cause you don't control an army but a single hero
LoL ISN'T from Warcraft, tho.
live-streaming a live-stream
seems legit
that's why it falls on its own category
MOBA
a mod in warcraft introduced the moba genre
hawaii is the 50th state
Hey that's a good song
and I think I've got myself something to do while waiting for season 3
Give me reasons why I should plat WOW
Alright that's all the influence I need
/me mains Sona
no fucks given
Meanwhile...captain teemo reporting for duty
with Luna
I enjoy WoW. Even now. Always can level an alt- somethingmof an altaholic.
Lol okay.

This music
It's not really the same kind of item setup.
there we go
you have a nice house
In LoL it's all passive +50 deathray or whatever.
There are some on-use items but for the most they're stat sticks.
04HAHA
yeah the items only give bonus's...or such...only a few items that have useses
04Canadian_Brony got kicked XD
OMG LoL
somewhat
Kill mobs, get xp, level up, unlock/upgrade skills. Each champion only has 4 skills including an ultimate and they're all fairly easy to understand.
Welp

Yayneigh.
Problem?
yeah! Hipsters wear propeller hats now
13rain rain~<333
hai Rain
And summoner spells are pretty much the same except not unique for champions, rather you pick the ones you want from a list at the start of the match.
Allo Rain.
Guys
I have bad news
hello everybody
oh hai Rain
I'd get into runes and flim flam but it'd be pointless because I fail at LoL anyway.
04Do you were thick rimmed glasses too, or tight button up shirts?

Yeah, I don't play much because the people on it make me cry.
Shit... now I feel old.

I'm 15
When I do play it's usually 1v1 with bots and a friend, and she steamrolls me every time anyway.
How are we 30 years behind?
I've givne my age out enough times.
04G1
YES
0,14that feel when the only reason I want to even approach LoL is because Riven >.>

13except AB+?
13never learned how the + and - fit into the can receive..
+ people can take + or - blood.
13we only learned the base letters.. O is universal donor, AB universal recipient
- people can only take - blood
needles!!!!!!!!!??
http://youtu.be/HOe1aVRjb_4
Great song
/me does not know his bloodtype
hate them blood sucks!!!!!!!
13and if + can take + or -, shouldn't someone who's AB+ be able to take AB+? :3c
13i think mine is A+.. i forget
if I'm wrong, don't blame me
13saw my birth certificate like exactly once..
AB+ can take any blood, it's the universal acceptor.
O- can be given to anyone, making it the universal donor.
/me is O- :3
Anybody on?
a +
i think
wooo blood types!
Rarest is AB-
second rarest is B-
Most common are A+ and O+
i though o was the rarest
13i'm just a O.. yes i'm only a O
positive
O+ however is the most common
04I'm straight up G, yo!

In the US, it's 6.6% according to the source I just linked
04I leave because the streets be calling me, dawg
peace out
no problem with needles if they go into my arms/legs/buttocks etc. I hate it when they try to stick a needle in my mouth.
11,02HXC
11,02Hai ^-^
There are instances though when the docs have to use type specific blood as far as i know.
well i gotta go... 21 hrs on ta net is really not gud 4 ma mind metink
ja ne
whey they have to match exact types, that's usually for more invasive things like transplants. For simple blood transfusion, you can always give O-negative whenever there's any doubt
11,02What are we all doing? :3
13discussing blood
http://youtu.be/l2X_D3ixlFI
I just used the same quote 3 times here . . .
yes you did

Or was it Read it and Weep?
http://youtu.be/n8Z6qiA0GR8
brb. I'm going to take a different approach . . .
Okay, I think I found the reason for Spiderman's inception in Ponyfanon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOb961sYXF8
If there is 20 degrees in my room and 3 degrees outside, I like to open the window to let those 3 additional degrees inisde :D
That'll be- *puts﻿ on sunglasses* 8 BITS! :P

11,02Indeed :3
IDK, that is a little strange.

I was going along with the joke
Okay, I got to the creepy part of this "Missing Frequencies" thingy.

Hmm, I think I could compare this show to Oh My Goddess.
Never said that was a BAD thing...
>wat
But both sides have their pluses for me.
Aka Rain.
>Mr
also, Algae studier?
Rain, I think you were just called a card :3
try fimfiction
Oh! Oh! Can I be the wild card?
thanks
Especially since it's entertainment of a trance. Which really isn't possible unless you're a hypochondriac.
:)
You don't know the meaning of phycology, Rain.
Yellop again everypony.
That's fimfiction.net
The same could be said to you, Rain.
thanks agiain
Okay then, explain to me how an outside imposed trance is possible.
I'm going to be a couple of minutes.
11,02Ghosties: IKR
did you not see her use magic to put him in one?
You're kidding me right?
do i really need a ancount
thats bullshit
also, in the real world, sugestive hypnotism
11,02EggWhite: Yesh please :3/
Why is the hypno circle in stream telling me to kill? O_o
Suggestive hypnotism? How do you do that?
/me noms on durians :3
...
excuse me for typing slowly
Pichonko
11,02I wish I had real durians to try :/
ever whisper into someone's ear while they sleep?
Ever give someone a roofie?
Sorry misa don't have any real ones :(
No, I want to eat one for real. With my mouth.
Or get them liqoured up?
yes
no actually
You know, something that isn't in a T.V. show?
i have like boss
stoned and or drunk is not hypnotised :\
no it makes them loose their inhabitions
But full control out of the blue would be Scopolamine.
Ok my nick did change... ignore me.
just hear that word recently, eh?
Which word? And why?
meh, whatever. this argument is going nowhere
Because you're losing?
pfffft
arguing is not a contest
and who's winning?
also, when debating something, being the loudest does not mean you are right.
Rain parlement disagrees with you...
its suggesting something to someone in a way that makes them believe it was their idea, not yours
Other than "whispering in someones ear when they're asleep."

Successful All Nighter
/me hugs everypony
Anyone going to say something in Renkoshima's defence?
/me is hugged and hugs back

/me is nommed on O.O;;
11,02:D
oh no no
or platonic chess which i assume is chess without sex but assume there has to be some difference between platonic chess and conventional chess
Really?
because I have arguments like this all the time
11,02:O
Because I'll bring something up that'll wallop you?
Well. most people aer doing it wrong!
/me motherofgod.jpg
Can we?
because most people run out of things to argue with
Neat trick.
ikr?
Rain I beg to differ!
/me has made an argument
I differ to beg!
fucking einstine there
-_-
/me wants to have a good time
Well, I was about to give you props for instigating the arguement, but now I'm convinced you're posturing.
I instigated? no sir/mam
.me dances

Oh look, a stream :3

Can we argue about pancakes then?
Yeah, I think I'm done for the night.
Then it's just a matter of time before they despise their guv'ment, try to quit or commit suicide.
awwww
that is how propaganda works
04Pancakes are delicious
back
04Just saying
^
Do we have an arguement?
/me shoots down the argument
Were we arguing?
imsorry
lol
And the suggstive hypnotism can be from the young and dumb believeing their guv'ment can't be trusted as if it couldn't have been trusted in the first place.

Well, there are certain shows which I like.
08,01meh
08,01i'm kinda bummed out
Saturn, long time no see!
Saturn: Why
08,01the lass i was trying to contact hasn't replied
Hey there, Saturn. I know that feel.
Saturn! want a nice picture to look at?
08,01so it's getting more and more likely that she's ignoring me
Or not.
08,01so i has a :(
:(
08,01Biglaw: aye
/me casts rejuvinate on Saturn.
http://fav.me/d561nr2 nice shot by moi
Saturn: Oh, same thing happens to me I can never get in contact with my friend, then I get paranoid that they are trying to avoid me
I hate it when that happens ;~;
You know, Saturn, one time I was flat out rejected by someone I'd developed a crush on.
08,01EggWhite|DurianTrade: i... did something
I never developed a crush on anyone since.
08,01that means i wouldn't be surprised if they wanted to ignore me
08,01she was hitting on me at LAC
Oh my
Saturn :3 thanks
Dang navit!
nabit*
Saturn, to some people, it's one way or the other. Could that be the case for this lady?
...
Good afternoon everypony :)
08,01Polydunami: i don't eve know if i'm just being paranoid about this, or she was actually offended by it, to be honest
08,01i mean
08,01we were kinda hitting it off
08,01and maybe quite well
08,01but nothing was said either way about it
08,01so meh
08,01i dunno
Hi everypony!
Heyp.
08,01she was really awesome!
Well, I'm not much of an expert on this kind of an issue.
Saturn: misa no know I suck at anything to do with socializing.
Saturn: Would it be possible to contact her in some other way in order to explain?
08,01>friendliest fandom ever
I think I'm gonna eat something soon
08,01>everyone claims to suck at socialising
I don't socialise, I entertain.
08,01Kammerjunk: i only have her deviantart and her e-mail
08,01Polydunami: a rejection would be fine! just not ignoring...
I do, most people can only get 2 words out of me.
Sometimes 3
We were good friends beforehand too.
Saturn: If you never meant to cause her offence, would it then be possible to explain that to her?
silly Saturn
08,01maybe she just hasn't seen my message
Alright, time to eat
brb
Oh ok wait there is a convention here, I was not informed.
08,01because ... honestly, i don't want to be, really
08,01no time for anything like that
I know how you feel Saturn
08,01i crush on people to easily
I was that way once, Saturn.
08,01it's like it's just an inevitable stage of frienship i go through with everyone i know
08,01male, female, gay, straight
I know how you feel about being ignored, but having a crush on someone, me no know.
...Or asexual.
Or polysexual.
You are tearing me apart, Saturn!
08,01i like crockery
Me
>.>
Pansexuality for the win!
08,01oh goddamnit, why do i keep spilling things on myself?
04Because you were laughing at me :P
/me puts up hand "high five anyone?"
Mostly
00,02Boo Ya
08,01Saturn: we need some external corroboration
Corroba-what
08,01whoops
08,01Polydunami: we need some external corroboration
hi everyone
08,01Polydunami: in whcih case, this is very relevant: http://ompldr.org/vZW1xdA
Whats corroboration?
I really don't understand
pansexual you say? :3c

08,01i'm only drinking coffee because i've run out of tea
Well, I enjoyed that breakfast

Omni is best prefix.

08,01they both mean "all"
Misa knows :)
08,01ah, okay
08,01i used to have a social circle of lots of Andrews
I like using Omnisexual rather then pansexual but pansexual is more commonly used.

get derpy eyes
00,02killerpony7733, i'm thinking that
00,02cloaking system seems like it'd be more usefull
00,02then again that uses energy
00,02too bad it wont recharge more than one battery
00,02EggWhite|DurianTrade, thing says it uses a lot
Oh ok wow that is alot.
Hey guys
ahhh, DE:HR
how is everyone?
00,02allso thinking of getting the typhoon system
I'm good
Typhoon is such a silly aug
i didnt like the typhoon whn i played
00,02but explosions
00,02but explosions
00,02^
the blow em up
Explosive /)
00,02^
lol
00,02EggWhite|DurianTrade, (\
00,02dem hacking addons would make hacking laughably easy
That gives twice as much explosions as typhoon
:D
00,02theres allso the two at once mele thing
that is AMAZING
wtf
00,02i dont know
yeah, no point going for extra cells
00,02it only recharges one of the two now
00,02multi-takedown or batteries?
but it wont if you completely drain it
00,02soo tempted to get the typhoon
the recharge speed are useful, but pretty much a waste of time to get the batterys
Do it!
Make things explode
00,02multi-takedown is probably a limited use thing
00,02bit'
Explosions
00,02i'd allso like the aim stabilizer
Yeah it helps get rid of all recoil
Remove ALL the recoil!
Fun fact, I always pick stats upgrades instead of flashy moves that do shit damage :D
hmmm

00,02ok

hmm..
00,02i doubt theres a difference
thers no actual karma system

no tranqa
00,02wonder if i can do both
annoyingly you can't do both
00,02as in i fail or just doesnt count?

Even if they did only a handful of trusted people would be allowed.

Ouch
o,o
ok
But TERA's combat was pretty decent, I'll admit, it's just not my flavor. *shrug*
Beautyfull..
I definitely prefer TERA's combat over, say, WoW's. But really, my MMO of choice is EVE Online.
the only MMO I really liked was WoW, everything else seems to bore me.
