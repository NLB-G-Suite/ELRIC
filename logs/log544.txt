Yeah!!
I'm asking owliciouc
otakon: what?

otakon: i have custom songs lol
08,01r63?

Discord is an awesome song, but I prefer the remix TBH
otakon: so i have this song on rock band
Hawaii has no BronyCon Me thinks...

Lunar_Brony: k thanks
When is BoB starting?
Feasttalon: soon I think
Lunar_Brony: how can you prefer the remix?
this is way superior
man, i can;t stand this song. I understand that it's beloved, but to me, it's horrible.
08,01otakon: i don't ping on the term r63
Point an laugh at Gilda
you pink on the term r\d+?
Poor Gilda
show a real vid 4 calestias sake

let's watch the living tombstone version music video
so very very hated
Lightning-Quill: nah
..though I am a sucker for accordian.
timstr117: It's called music
Lightning-Quill: this is better
Oh well then I will
u know who deserves love????
i know but why cant someone show a vid of mlp
pinkie guy
cachi01 it has a more technological feel to it. Also, I used it in a dance competition at school. Won first place, hands down
Why don't we watch Ouran High School Host Club?
timstr117: bc if we did that all the time it would not be the treat it is.
Lunar_Brony: FUCK YEAH DAT WIN /)
Feasttalon: Bishi fest? Hell, why not Hetalia in that case?
thats messed up
yay
cachi01 /)
timstr117: Yeah. It's bronystate not ponystate
Yeah!
Meh
08,01otakon: i may have been lying
Lunar_Brony: but i prefer this version cause of the feeling its an old arcade beat
08,01but you will never know
no to germany "invading" poland
and we really REALLY need to suppor
t
Best song ever :)
Let's watch the skyrim mod version. (just kidding too gorey)
pinkie guy his music is AWESOME
quick! We must get into the /media/TARDIS!
timstr117: not really, think of it this way. If your favorite food was served EVERY DAY for every meal wouldn't you eventually tire of it? Same concept, we keep ponies to a minimum so we don't get tired of them.
he doesnt get the love he deserves
2,14 it's hardly even a minimum...
Caramel: what's a minimum then?
2,14 a minimum would be like, only showing it during BMN
i agree with ponies47
well, it's not minimum if we don't count PMV's and G1-G3.5 showings
Double the Pinkie!
don't forget tea parties
i love this song, it makes me proud of becoming a brony
twi is best Pony!!!!

SolairePony89: keep smiling!
2,14 Well, there are plenty of ways to watch pony related things, plenty of synchtubes and whatnot. We try to bring a plethora of entertainment. If people *really* can't go that long without their pony fix, they're welcome to turn off the stream and sit in the chat
SMile Smile Smile

Caramel: aye

timstr117: wat?
I love this show
timstr117: not surprising
Every morning, I have Toaster Scrambles for breakfast. Every day, I have Yakisoba (or the Chow Mein packages that are almost the same thing). I don't really get tired of it. I don't mind a change of pace now and then, though.

Hey spits
2,14 hello spitfire
Heya Spitfire

Caramel: can you pleaaase stream loco or scootaloos wing or any song from pinkie guy pleaaaseeee?
8,6because I find this amusing as hell:
8,6On July 3, 2012, tumblr user cardiganponi made a post titled “IMPORTANT MESSAGE ABOUT BRONYCON ORGY” [1]. The message in question was to warn other bronies about the possibility that crabs was contracted by several members of the orgy.
2,14 no

Hey bros

Ohai Spitfire :) WHAT! :O
Caramel: can you stream( )
I want Fluttershy with a juice bos
/me thinks Spitfire would like to be a tree
2,14 timstr, I would advise you read the rules. The chat is meant to be civil at all times. If you can't keep yourself civil over something as incredibly insignificant as a stream, then leave.

AttackPony: Congrats!
timstr117 because vast amounts of MLP becomes tedious. Therefore, adding variety will either stop that from happening or slows down the process.
ok now it badass
The shape is okay, and the fabric is okay, but it needs to be about 20% cooler
i betcah did

.............goddammit
icybeauti nope stream is uo no buffer so no youtube
otakon rage is strong today
someone complained
Whew, we're safe
did someone ask for ponies?
get Valed on
Was it me?
:l
NOT AGAIN!!!!!!!!
^
When do ponies come back to tv :<
timstr117: protip SHUT THE BUK UP
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
he is pissing val off
Oh......-.-
Lunar_Brony: no, someone just complained about the content of the stream
I want new ponies
who ping?
I'm the quiet one so not me
and thus we get NO STREAM
Tom: you dont say
He's gonna have a bad time.
Beefchief never, they hate us now.
:<
Thanks Tom. Your always there for our updates :)
otakon why the buck would someone complain
Hey guys guess what
Beefchief: I know the feel bro.
when you complain
/)-_-) GODDAMMIT
Val doesnt stream
got it?
Lunar_Brony: bc they didn't like the music or some such
therefore
I want Discord back :<
dont complain
otakon -_(\
and you get a stream
otakon: timstr117 complained
Beefchief: Mabe he'll do a luna styled comeback.
but it's caramel. She wouldn't let anypony down
Does asking for something count as complaining?
Why do you think I'm silent all the time :D
yeh like an hour ago
or give anypony up, or hurt anypony
or make them cry
owlicious: you mean EGOOOORAPTOR?
The complainer in no way shape or form reflects the overall feelings of the stream from the general community.
owlicious: who is also Val. so no
oh my god
and i wasnt the only one
MY EARS
Wah!!!!!!
WHY MUST 10 YEARS OLDS BE GIVEN MICS
?
I prefer a Star Trek TNG "Tapestry" episode but with Discord and Fluttershy
So what's streaming? I'm still on Diablo.
I'm just confused now
O_O I just walked in, who's complaining? Is this timberwolf gonna have to bite somepony?
well confusion is fake
Hey guys, sorry for my absence. Was watching some Youtube videos...
I jsut want John to come back. He has one of the coolest voices ever.
confusion doesnt exist
it does. Clearly we need a separate chat room where we can introduce newponies to the real channel.
U DONT EXIST!
swear to god...the other team has 4 engis..and they arnt capping
WHy must thier be 30 sec ads?
Touche
Well, playing TF2 on a netbook isn't the most ideal expeience
hmmm.... Cake?
experience*
because that is how they make money
because mips is cruel.
dat lie pony_9944
You think they'll haver a "Make a pony and we'll put it on TV" contest?
and that is why u dontt haft to pay
Everything in this world isn't free, that's why.
icybeauti: maaaaaaaaaybe
Finished watching Anthology 2 - crashed in the last 20 minutes before
cachi01: Now that would be a hell of a contest. Especially with all the artist and all.
Stop posting things that would correspond with an Image I start daydreaming about it
Cypresswolf: the last 20 aren't the best though
:'(
icybeauti: or a pay about 300000 dollars and get your oc in the series
cachi01: Or that :D
LOL
otakon: yeah, it does wind down quite a bit
cachi01 Shut up and take my bits!
My mom agreed to take me to bronycon again next year. -victory screech-
Meanwhile: Val /was/ streaming, but people complained and now they have nothing
8,6nothing atm, someone was bitching it was but wasn't ponies, so Val stopped
icybeauti lucky you :)
my mom agreeed to take me to E3 and bronymexicon next year YAY
oh here we go
ominous sounding music . . .
I'm going to BronyCon next year even if I have to walk there
timestr117: Speaking of making money, I don't think Capcom is listening to thier decicated fans anymore, ever since they cancelled Megaman Legends 3, they keeps trowing DLCs and others at your faces! This makes me not want to buy another Capcom game ever again...
maybe i will be able to see HL3
Biglaw|TF2: Thank god I live so close.

Actually...I am the only one not SLIGHTLY freaked out by this...

I love that song though.
People, people, how long will it take you all to lern, they operate by collective punishment round these parts?

Isn't cthulu a giant eyeball?
There IS a meaning to this...G3.5 IS the worst generation.
no idea.
and now he trolls
tf2 sounds hilarious, the sounds repeat, in a funny fashion
like a bawss
hen3ry: "Hands of one, hands of all"
Feasttalon: it's more like a giant squid with tentacles for a beard
Now let's all just get down to the dungeon, and try and cheer up. After all, worse things happen at sea.
God
creppy picture EPIC SONG!!!!!!
Whoever kept pushing Caramel's buttons, I am innocent of your crimes.

icybeauti: They DID say that Discord ruled Equeestria in a state of chaos and unhappiness. They must have been referring to gen 3 and 3.5 :O
kidzrul434: Ahem...they're not ponies, they're Discord's ponies.
thats the point
Cypresswolf: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
Alright. This stream is effectively dead for the rest of the evening. To anyone who looked forward to seeing Band of Brothers, the people who were complaining about the stream earlier owe you an apology.

shaving with FREEZING WATER
Wonder what they do in britian for our independence day....
Xaiden yup
so dis one time, a friend of mine told me not to read Cupcakes, so I didn't. I got curious, so I went on Omegle question mode and asked.
Xaiden: eeyup, ep ...5 I think
Forget BCC, I'll start my own con, with hookers and pony rides.
I don't think they hav one
Dken2021: THANK GOD I LOVE THIS EPISODE
hookers!
icybeauti: Don't know for sure, but I think they celebrate getting rid of us backwards, cultureless Yanks
icybeauti: We do all the stuff we usually do every other regular day.
It wouldn't be a issue if the was a Duchy of New Brunswick
shnow
dis is what ensued: http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3170/cupcakesq.jpg
NO
hah
Yeah.....I went on omegele once....Not pretty.
I am in charge of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw!!
Then we fought them, won, then had a party.
oh dayum
Kencolt: except the war was underway for over a year by that point.
In fairness, he was mad and his son wasn't a great help
Thats rough
icebeauti: A political party. Ba Du Boom
derp
I'm just making fun of you.
For some reason, there was a stop light flashing like four times a second :p
o_o
get that through your head
I was on for 5 seconds....Ugh I hate that place...It's a bunch of professer oaks.
o_o
You can't ignore their girths
Bronystate doing anything for the 4th?
05,15Big_Macintosh_1992 you're looking at it
oh don't forget military of the French
05,15Band of Brothers awww yeah
fluttercry: oh
Oh, military stuff.....AWESOME!!!!
Mutterguy: True, France helped. Mostly to piss off Britain.
morphine!
Well, that's not the whole story either. We had some instances of real dumb luck. Like being the beneficiaries of the one French naval victory over the British within a century
nom
Morphine :D
Morphine!!
drugs!
Then the brits came back in 1812.
05,15for unrelated reasons
Two medics, one hole... oh mai
08,01Kencolt: nice
is it just me or are there new mods here?
icybeauti: to be fair... we attacked first in 1812.
Two medics, one hole, Uber Chain!
LOL STDs
DAMN YOU MIPS.TV!, i cannot see the stream! (probably due to weak connection.)
08,01Kencolt: that's awesome!
8,6there haven't been new mods in about 5 months
05,15superretroworld no you're just seeing some os us for the first time
Feasttalon: You rang?
superretroworld nah, you probably haven't seen them yet
Medics chain, tf2 reference
It would be cool to mod...But I have no webcam equipment.
oh
icybeauti: we started 1812 trying to get Canada, while the UK was distracted by Napoleon. And we by all rights should have been reconquered.
13are people startin
Our is based around a piece of paper that wasn't upheld until a century later
Kencolt: See the one in NYC
Shizuka: They're slags if they are.
dat shrapnel
hen3ry: and we burned down the white house
08,01superretroworld: i'm the last mod to have been promoted, so if you've seen me before, you've probably seen the othe rmods
OH BUCK
then they repainted it white
best time to see all mods, is during Brony movie nite
Shizuka: they already did dear, you missed the GREAT STREAM BLACKOUT OF JULY 2, 2012.
You didn't burn it down, a tornado put it out
Then we had the civil wa- Wait, britian wasn't there for that.
8,6being a mod does not automatically mean you get to stream
Shizuka: courtesy of Caramel bc someone was being a dick.
Shizuka: tf2 teim?
otakon: It's July 3, 2012
*somepony
besides, being a mod means you have to watch over rooms as well
you gotta work for that stream
Only certains stream, or the ones who have the time and equipment?
stop startin!
AttackPony: yar you right
you gotta want it
DERP
05,15Why is this series so good!?
UGHH BUFFERING

I started watching star trek the next gen today.
I haven't seen this show, all thanks to Bronystate for letting me see this...
back when dyke wasn't a lesbian slur, or was it back then?
Dken2021: It was back then, but now the younger lesbians use it.
Haku got shot once
/me sneezes
In the leg
At first, I was like "This is something like Medal Of Honor", but then a soldier shot me to the forehead...
bullet to the nvm
and that's how he became a guard
He took a bullet to the knee?
Twas a fun paintball day

Sweet!
I would like to be in that hole
So is this taking place in WW1 or WW2?
ww2

Boots got blown to hell
You can tell by the helmet design
Hello Everyone.
goddammit
LOL "liek everybody else"
hiya Ninjazz

Morphine was a blessing when I had my hip replaced. Knocked me right out. This was not a job for a local, I can tell you.
My feet are 13's
because WW1 was stupid
Haku wishes to see a first person shooter that takes place in Nam
Feasttalon: in this one you dont have to guess if the word hello is true a lie or doubt about it
I can't fit in no 9's
no one remebers WW1
KABOOM
GODDAMN WREK BOT
All i remeber from WW1 is s mask.
gas*
What about All Quiet on the Western Front?
Or how about a time traveling game where your forced to battle in several different famous wars
05,15506th PIR 101st Airborne E Company
otakon: got owned by the AASK?
05,15Why do I remember that
or the original big 4
lol
thats Verdune right?
cachi01: I hate that goddamn bot
More than that
lol
This sounds like a bunch of scouts and one medic
it is
I remeber 42 P sherman wallaby way sydney.
2 medics and a hole
they're paratroopers, not heavy infantry
Start out in Cold War, tt first to WW2, then to Nam, then the future, like Halo war
Incoming!!!
ARTILLERY!
dat Phase4 and his phaziness.
Dken2021: I do-- not that I was there, but I did study it. WWI was an excercise in NAtional Stupidity-- old simmering feuds in Europe-- which led to some of the bloodiest fighting, and set the stage for WWII, an excercise in insanity and inhumanity.
[SWAG]Haku: the closest thing i can think of is Radiant Historia, but that's only one war
is Sumica streaming?
00,02lolwut
no, it's Caramel
Exactly
dat adasdad is a spy
Spamming medic doesn't make me run any faster.

And then you go to a pre-gun war
See?
HERR DOKTOR!
"War is the old and bitter's way of getting the young and stupid to kill each other"
Scouts and one medic
Meanwhile How about doctor?
05,15Ouch

Oh splinters
SO they got supplies from that one Trench area right?

cachi01: I never really was on your side.
a little bit ago?
war is fear camouflaged in courage
05,15medic I know your Chains
adasdad: then im the spy?
It's just a paper cut.
Meanwhile Chiropractor?
and this is why being the feild medic is the MOST BALLSY JOB IN THE WAR
Looks like what's his face's wound from All is Quiet
medic: hmmm, because you like attention?
I know you know I'm Chains...
Wait, that's a type of doctor
FAIL
DashWithRainbows:Lol, that's not a doctor.
cachi01: we are ALL the spy.
Dat break
DUN DUN DUUUUN
Its just a flesh wound.
Blood on trousers? Thats the OWRST POSSIBLE THING!
SOmeone said something akin to this "Humanity is abhorrent in the fact that the old use the young to kill each other with" or some such
Tis just a scratch
this is the most Dramatic part of the war and scariest
Blood on trousers? Rarity is disappoint.
Flesh wound? Your whole arms off!
Meanwhile: :D
RainBowJack: yeah...battle of the buldge...

AppleDash
hurray Hooch!
check out the leg on dat Lt.
I know this part i have the hole series on 6 DVDs
DWR: That's a bit of a mouthful. Perhaps you could just go with "I'M DYING!"
ID rather fight in WWII Euro theatre then a modern war
I don't think he need to be told not to walk on a shot up leg
05,15The day they released this in Blu Ray I was all over that
why dont you clean the blood first its gonna leave a stain, hes getting heavy WHY DO I HAVE TO HOLD HIM
Meanwhile Maybe just "Help!" would suffice.
she sounds like FIW luna.
Well modern warfare is good if you have a tech advantage
05,15operatorpony and die? Modern times you have a better chance at staying alive
I think this was one of the few i've sat down to watch
DWR: That doesn't sound as funny though.
waatches a guy dying in a IRL war film= meh watches soup dying in mw3 = NOOOOOOOOOO!
Use bleach or peroxide or something, just don't get blood staineD!
fluttercry: ehhh.. I don't care.
cachi01: Plays MW3. = NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nice intestines bro
05,15Also, this series TOTALLY didn't make me cry

That one is much more serious than basic BSS
Caramel: too bad i dont have that yet
Feasttalon: you always hated it?
sleep is for the weak
anyone know if LadyCanary is doing alright?
Caramel To become a mod, one must stare into the abyss of the damned and not become insane. Or just pass several other tests.

Was that from when he was streaming SBB the other day?
Time just never seems to call for it
what is being mature?
Caramel: Well too be fair, you hired a staff of crazy people, then went to the internet where crazy is so normal that sanity looks batshit insane...

Dken2021 how?:/
I like that you didn't deny your ovaries.
fluttercry: Agreed

The only things that have given me any trouble so far have been Azmodan and that one despair guy during the hope angel thing.
8,6diablo is pretty easy to get to, especially if you're playing with people
05,15Spears is still alive
Lunar_Brony: THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PYRO FUCKING MANIA
fluttercry: It's about war, what'd you except?
Death idk, idc

hey TheHoodyNinja!
fluttercry: Erm, no
I'm gonna go,'night,everypony!
Night SpiderJack
05,15Also there is justification. You can't let the prisoners go, but you can't use resources on them.
Inb4 abuse of artistic license.
Hi MahBoi777 and Ponies47
05,15What else do you do?
SolairePony89: This is based on real facts- these incidents did occurr. And War isn't always rational. In fact, it very rarely is.
SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK
otakon: The AntiBronyBrotherhood. If I was a mod and I was streaming, I would be streaming how to deal with parasprites, because the antibronybrotherhood is trying to kill our love and tolerance code, and kill off the millions of bronies.
Hey there, TheHoodyNinja.
oh shit half-life fic
HI Ninjazz
PinkiePC|Messenger: buck em
05,15whoops

Ninjas are awesome.

All those updates and I'm not reading any of them.
Question: Has anyone here (from the US) ordered a shirt from welovefine?
GUYS
otakon: We need to warn everyone... they even have their own poster.
SolairePony89: We don't know his motives-- and again, that was what was reported. Weither is actually happened in history is uncertain.
the ABB has a Steam group
05,15SolairePony89 it's not that he wanted to. and like I said, nobody knows if he actually did it. But if he did, there was nothing else that could have been done with them. Fact is, the guy is a great leader
otakon: What?
Ponies47: Don't worry, my friend.
I think we shold ALL join
^^^
I was just about to say that
Midnight_Fyre: No. Why?

/me chases the shiny bouncy ball
05,15I haven't been on EqD in months
Midnight_Fyre: I forgot how much it was but I think it's between 4 and 10 dollars if you live inthe US
Anti Brony Brigrade/Brotherhood. Get all your brony friends to join and ask what the deal is yo, or you know... post ponies. But that is not really love and tolerance
Whats the name of this show?
I cann't agree. Joining such a board would be trolling them. And trolling them would be wrong. And anyhow, they won't getnearly as big as EQD anyhow.
Also, herro everypony ^-^
i just look for music i like and comics
I have EQD up all day erryday.
hiya BroKnee
AttackPony: Not too bad I guess. About what I expected
BroKnee: Band of Brothers
Hello there, BroKnee.
it would serve them right tbh
05,15Besides, Love and Tolerance IS our anti troll technique.
Should i continue playing computer? Or stay here with you guys?
Midnight_Fyre: Expensive if you don't have the money:D
oh look I come back and another ep :)
05,15That's why love and tolerance even exists
Hi BroKnee
I gotta be honest i feel unloved here
fluttercry: so, join the group and play TF2 with them?
hey BroKnee
fluttercry: Silly idea. I believe in ignorance.
AttackPony: True. Good thing I just started a new job
05,15You "kill em with kindness" as they say
well, looks like some bronies already joined

Midnight_Fyre: Sweet. I've been looking for a job sine I moved in with my sis almost 2 years ago. No luck yet.

Besides, wghat they have is a lame facebook page... and most posts are random.
check the comment
TheHoodyNinja: If I were totally ignorant why would I care?
Midnight_Fyre: I'm still looking
I saw it Barbetos
Meanwhile: If you do care, its because you were molested by a wolf when you were 5
wut?
Midnight_Fyre: goddamn good luck man
TheHoodyNinja: But what about the pancakes?
otakon: Thanks
otakon: So,... the only comments are an agrument about which is best pony. I'd say that fails.
Meanwhile: someone stole them...
Kencolt: eeyup... they won't go far.
/me sings Dykes praises
TheHoodyNinja: what.
Pancakes?
otakon: How old is the group?
Meanwhile: I wasnt looking for a minute and someone stole the pancakes :S

So a few days ago I bought those glittering Twilight and Rainbow Dash blindbags. Then I suddenly remembered how much I hate that glittery stuff that gets everywhere
Mmmm canadian bacon.
Does that mean your all figments of my imagination?
eeeeyope.
Ahh, bacon
The whoooolllee Brony fandom, its alll a dream.
moop
Poniesneverbeenmade
I dont want to wake up!
05,15Barbetos then who were those people I met at bronycon?
05,15What WAS bronycon?
A HUGE DREAM.
I did not go... =(
fluttercry: apparently i have very expansive dreams
Youreally shouldn't have picked the red pill.
I used imagination to go!
=D
I also bought a Twilight brushable and have come to the conclusion that I hate pony hair
That's sad. :I
And streams.
08,01i missed all the bronycon stuff
08,01i was away at the weekend :(
why is e3 and bronycon so close?
Barbetos: But mostly dreams I take it? :P
couldnt go to either
TheHoodyNinja: Palatte cleanser
I thought i had the choice
but then i had to go to dads
SolairePony89 man I WISH to dream about ponies. I am seldom that lucky
Ninjazz: Not so much a fire as a melt.
The roof, the roof, the roof was on fire
I get random dreams about trains and relatives that I don't actually have
I have had 3 dreams that involve ponies
05,15Barbetos. Do you like trains?
Kencolt, that's what I heard atleast. I wasn't there or even was watching the stream at the time. :P
Barbetos: I'm never that lucky. If I could dream of ponies I'd actually want to dream
and i dont remember any of them
Ninjazz: Pics on EQD, somewhere.
fluttercry Nah. I don't particularly feel anything about trains.
/me puts EqD on his to-do list "Ty, Kencolt"
05,15lol the "promotion"
are they just gettign rid of him? Or do that accually liek him?
Hey there, Saxy.
Woa, we still on livestreaman?
05,15it's like when you "promote" someone to the ice station in Antarctica
0,14oh hai Ninjazz
Promotion is to get outta there.

Spriggals: Although they haven't been able to spot it
oh SILLY ME I WAS WATCHING A RECORDING
dont worry
also hello everyone
Hey there, CrimsonPhoenix.
I did a Steam Group list for anti brony. The largest anti-brony group is Anti-Brony Federation of The World (ABFW) with 90 members. The search did turn up a large number of brony groups whose descriptions mention antibronies. Four of them are larger than the largest antibrony group.
hey CrimsonPhoenix!
Haku returns!
dat helmet
wb
so many dings
May I talk to the person that runs the livestream page of Bronystate?
wb [SWAG]Haku!
:D
Chat suddenly got quiet again.
indeed
Okay. Searching for anti pony turned up a 252 member group called Anti-Pony Association ((APA)).
eeeeyup
Haku thought that Chat was derping
go spears
Ohey there, [SWAG]Haku.
Yo Ninjazz
/me kicks a tumbleweed through chat
Kandarihu its kind of silly that there would be so many groups over something that, currently, seems to only be a passing fad.
/me gets hit in the face with a tumblweed
ow.
/me puts a bandaid on Ninjazz's face
Haku likes that guy
Ninjazz: u okay?
Aggressive tumbleweed
I think... Thanks, TheHoodyNinja. ;~;
Tumbleweed used Tacke
[SWAG]Haku: Tacke? thats a new one
soo SaxyPretender how has your day been?
tackel
=|
Poor Fluttershys :(
0,14pretty good
Haku just thaught it to Haku's Pikachu
0,14up until I found out this cosplayer I took a picture with at BronyCon was a NASA EMPLOYEE
We will hold the line.
0,14and now I am le sad ;__;
why are you sad?
that you didnt know
?
0,14yep
Well, for one thing, MLP FiM has had a fan following for a bit too long to be considered a passing fad. Secondly, most of these groups are quite small.

hi WindWhistler
It's a seapony parody of Strawberry Fields
WindWhistler . . . ugh, dammit
http://i.imgur.com/AiNMM.png
Anyways, I just witnessed one of the most awesome series finales ever to appear on the face of the Earth.
Where are they now? Oh you know, over there... and there... and there... and a little bit over there
Dang it Larson can't stop laughing
05,15yfw MLP won't have a series finale and will just end
/me attacks Sylandest with surprise hugs
HAH!
why are they still at that spot, youd think theyd at least move, or, y'know, stop the people shooting the artillery
Ninja attack.
evening, everypony-oh god! *is hugged by Ninjazz*
0,14oh hai Sylandest
>:3
/me hugs Ninjazz back :)
evening Sylandest
hay Sylandest
in heaven they are up to season 30 and are continuing to make new episodes
And no one is interested in knowing which finale I had just watched? :(
/me stands on Ninjazz's head
howdy, SaxyPretender!
you mods get cool text
howdy, Lunar_Brony and AttackPony
sorry WindWhistler what
/me 's head is being smooshed into Sylandest
Avatar.
But seriously, how did that series turn out so AMAZING?
/me glomps Sylandest
which one?
Ninjazz: most unexpected...but not unpleasant! :D
Sylandest! :D
Original or Korra?
howdy, MahBoi777!
WindWhistler Last Airbender or Korra?
Original.
afk
Korra x Aang
Sylandest: Hello again.
13http://xkcd.com/1077/
13done
howdy, Om! :)
Sylandest *muffle voice* what's that supposed to mean?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: theyre the same person...
WindWhistler: TLA? love dat show
now they aren't
Ninjazz: you have a very comfy head? :$
no they aren't
Aang x Korra
And Korra seems to be doing well too.
actually, they shorta are the same
So....would that be selfcest?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Aang was reincarnated into Korra
Thats why its called having "Past Lives"
His spirit lives within her
so thats what Shizu has been doing
Sylandest, *muffled voice* Ah. Okay. *resumes hugging*
:D
Wait, does the next Avatar appear after the previous one dies?
Just as every Avatar lived inside Aang
so... different people
WindWhistler: yeah Aangs dead
WindWhistler Yes
The only person from the original series is Katara
Sort of like the Dalai Lama.
13ah midnight before the 4th of july and someone's setting off fireworks
everyone else dead
Lemme rephrase that
05,15So when you say Aang x Korra, you really mean Aang x Aang.
Is the new Avatar born as the former one dies?
05,15Also, I hate that show
no I mean Aang x Korra
WindWhistler: yeah
8,6he's industrious, he got a box
/me hides behind flame shield
this scene
D=
fluttercry: DOES NOT COMPUTE.
/me explodes
I don't want to see legend of Korra my loyalties lie with aang
fus ro dah!!!!!!!!!!
fluttercry, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! One does not simply hate Avatar.
im sorry fluttercry you mean Korra?
How much longer is this?
/me implodes twice
Shizuka: farily certain i've been hearing fireworks all day.....either than or they are gunshots
10 hours
/me explodes, and then explodes again
05,15I simply hated it. Does this mean I can walk into Mordor?
0,14same here
-_-
05,15AND find Gondor?
enope
O__O
fluttercry: The Last Airbender? or the legend of Korra?
It means you. Will. Die.
but you can walk into Rodrom
fluttercry: Surely you must have SOME reason to dislike the show?
ANSWER ME!
You be asking for the impossible, fluttercry! D:
im going to label hating The Last Airbender as a disease
there's nothing that says you can't walk into Rodrom
05,15Both. I watched a few episodes of both and it just did not interest me
I can understand disliking it...but hating it seems a little out there without a good reason.
haters gonna hate
fluttercry: Isn't it a bit harsh to say you hate it then?
fluttercry: Which episodes? Not all are epic
Rodrom - (mordor backwards)
there's nothing that says you can't walk into (mordor backwards)
05,15Not harsh to me
Ah, I see.
welp i just yanked the power cord out of my moniter
fluttercry: ... no u cant judge cuz u watch a couple of shitty episodes.
That means your a bad person
Hate and dislike pretty much mean the same thing to you then, fluttercry
amirite?
I'm sorry, but what do you expect them to do watch the whole series?
05,15Well I did. It failed to make a good first impression so I have no need to continue down that path
8,6does it really matter if someone doesn't really care for something you may like?
05,15Now back to BoB
kirzstryfe: no but EVERYONE likes TLA
Ikr?!
It's just odd, is all.
"Stop not liking what I like!" "Stop liking what I dont like!"
8,6I've run into a few people that didn't really care for the show
hi guys, whats going on
I like Korra>Aang
kirzstryfe: Well, I wouldn't have said anything if fluttercry simply said he did not like the show, but the "hate" bit threw us off.
SeaponiesofLiverpool: your weird as hell then
I like Avatar.
TheHoodyNinja: you're*
Meanwhile: NO U!
2,14 and now TheHoodyNinja knows how I feel about pre-Gen4 :P
FIAH!
Because, you know, hate is a strong word.
I'ma Hoody Ninja
thats the WHOLE SONG
I still think you messin' with us, Val. :o

YAY Canada
Canadian_Brony you obviously didn't get the reference did you?
IshBestPony My serenety has dissapeared. The US has started 4 wars alone.
Canadian_Brony, I never said anything about the US but I was merely saying that NOT STARTING a war but PARTICIPATING in one means nothing.
don't say I didn't warn you
Canadian_Brony so you didn't get the reference?
From the South Park Movie

I wonder if Canadian_Brony can tell the difference between a joke and a serious?
fluttercry: Ah. The US did NOT start the Veitnam War, rather we came to aid of South Vietnam in an existing war. (And we negotiated a peace, that when we left, the North Vietnamese broke almost instantly.)
I dunno what this conversation is about but it looks stupid.
meanwhi- lol :I
05,15wut is this
and then lol?
LEAGUE OF LEGENDS?
Something about... war... war never changes.
so Caramel is streaming now
Oh gosh
Fluffs: leauge of legends
fluttercry it's something
This is random.
Suddenly League of Legends.
Meanwhile You keep taking the words right outta my mouth.
what is this?!?
2,14 this is the stream of ChaosX, TSM's Ranged AD
is this WOW
A real person is on the screen? WHAT SORCERY IS THIS?!
05,15Kencolt true.
what map is this?
05,15is this LoL?
i hate it when people see lol and think it's wow T.T
it looks...different
fluttercry: yes
2,14 yes, it's LoL
and yes this is LoL
I guys I found Equestria
/me not sure if Red White and Boom or hick fireworks
Its in Praetoria, South Africa
THis has to be a recording, from the webcam inset?
it's still as horrible as last time I played
Crank bot ? madness
2,14 nope, it's live
wut?
05,15Sooo, it's like an RTS?
whats that song in the bg?
2,14 ChaosX is streaming this right now, and I'm restreaming it :P
fluttercry: ever played dota?
Ever heard of MOBAs, fluttercry?
Well it has it's own genre
I dunno if I'll make it to teh movie streams this week u gais
Caramel who is ChaosX?
so a stream within a stream?
2,14 and I keep saying ChaosX like a moron
but it is inspired by a custom map from an RTS game
2,14 Chaox* is TSM's Ranged AD
05,15I have neither heard of MOBAs nor played dota
IshBestPony: dats okey gud fer yu
DT!
IshBestPony join the club. I'm staying at my Grandparent's house with limited internet
fluttercry, dota is a custom map from Warcraft 3
Aww they ganking.
yo is there any bronies in the 50th state of USA?
Caramel: question does EVERY freakim member of TSM have there own damed stream?
it's just dat the fekkin internet keeps goin out
2,14 that's how they make money
MOBA standnif for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena
Who's TSM?
well, if no more shows, then cya guys
2,14 they stream their practice matches when not playing on tournaments
Haku is off
2,14 Team Solo Mid
pony_9944: is that Alaska or Hawaii?
Meanwhile: its a group
for extended periods of time
2,14 currently the #1 ranked team in the world
Right.
g'night [SWAG]Haku
2,14 and my personal favorites
05,15So it's from Warcraft....which means it's an RTS
05,15right?
Well it's not
Caramel: getting this from twitch.tv?
2,14 eeyup
cause you don't control an army but a single hero
LoL ISN'T from Warcraft, tho.
I am going to bed now. Thanks for the stream btw.
/me tried swordfish today for teh first tiem
fluttercry, in a nut shell, you get one hero unit and must assist masses of friendly waves to destroy the "core" of the enemy base.
live-streaming a live-stream
night, Barbetos
seems legit
that's why it falls on its own category
MOBA
a mod in warcraft introduced the moba genre
nite Barbetos
fluttercry: The original DOTA was built from Warcraft modding. It's like tower defense minion farming hero battles.
g'night Barbetos
IshBestPony: anything like lobster or crab?
Canadian_Brony: We need to go deeper.
hawaii is the 50th state
Gnight, Barbetos. Take care.
05,15That sounds really complicated
fluttercry: But you only control your champion.
Shamroc it tasted like any old other fish
Shamroc nothin unique
Hey that's a good song
fluttercry: fairly simple...kill stuff..dont die....break the other teams base
AttackPony right. I'll see if I can get a desktop recorder working and post this all over Youtube
That sounds like if you took Pikmin to an extreme.
Shamroc: and cs!
and I think I've got myself something to do while waiting for season 3
WATCH ALL OF STARTREK NEXT GENERATION
CrimsonPhoenix and that is?
fluttercry, you also get cool abilities that work well against other heroes but can also get you creamed against others.
pony95901...which falls under KILL STUFF
CrimsonPhoenix buck yeah! I'm in!
Shamroc: yeah i guess...
Give me reasons why I should plat WOW
Canadian_Brony: Okaaay
Im bored anyone got a conversation for me?
Lightning-Quill, don't
It's a game that you can play. Not really sure why you SHOULD, bu there you go.
/me mains Nocturne.
Alright that's all the influence I need
/me mains Sona
AttackPony you told me to go deeper. Do you want me to commentate it too?
no fucks given
/me remains a spectator
Canadian_Brony: Sure, if you want.
blitz is dangerous
TheHoodyNinja, do you think that Celestia should get her own episode?
AttackPony man, you love to literalize sarcasm, don't you?
oh great, teh rednecks are shootin fireworks
Ninjazz, yes
Meanwhile...captain teemo reporting for duty
with Luna
I enjoy WoW. Even now. Always can level an alt- somethingmof an altaholic.
Canadian_Brony: Yep :D
Ninjazz: I just want a scootaloo ep ;_;
Canadian_Brony: oh you have no idea lol
Lol okay.
CrimsonPhoenix, around the samething, sure.
HatchetRyda: I don't recall your name being AttackPony
sorr, will go back to being quiet *squee*
*sorry
Which reminds me-- I need to do a few dailies. BBL.
Thing is I hate playing LoL.
/me waves.
HatchetRyda: And if you attempt to take my other name, I'll hurt you.
seeya later Kencolt
Because I play like a spazz, and people are mean.
they have sweetie belle, lots of applebloom, and we even saw DT's dad, but nothing relating to scootaloo
Bye, ken
spazz?
later ken
AttackPony: wouldnt dream of it cutie
yeah Scootaloo do deserve her own episode
HatchetRyda: Good. Now, fetch me some tea.
http://derpy.me/oha15
I actually like that little tomboy filly
kirzstryfe Shizuka know if val has a Cutiemark ?
AttackPony: *sigh* yes dear *goes to get fresh made tea*
...
If he does it's probably a trollface.
HatchetRyda: Don't you use that tone with me.
CrimsonPhoenix who doesn't?
finger, y u stiffen :(
Why don't you check the mod section in the FAQ or Rules or wherever it is? About us.

Megaman Ez
2,14 it changes as he gains levels
2,14 it's rather awesome
TBH, I have never eaten Canadian Bacon
i hide in the back with bows and arrows and such
it actually is
strange, eh?
me neither
Rogue KS
hmm randomly d/c
Archer more like it.
Mutterguy, that's normal
I play rogue, daggers poison and stealth.
Canadian_Brony I can't think of a clever way to say it eh so....aboot
Meanwhile: then what would shizu and kirz be?
ok im tire see yall later
thoug daggers and poison are for assasins
tiredd*
04Aaaaaaand the front page has been updated with a 4th of July post. Happy Independence Day everyone!
tited*
not with a external client
FUCK
IshBestPony I have never heard a Canadian say "Aboot" unless they're making a joke
13what are we watching
depends on which rpg you're talking about
Shizu is offense mage.
Kirz is meat shield.
Tank/paladin ?
Meanwhile: question are we talking about a WOW 5 man dungeon party?
Canadian_Brony still can't recognize dem jokes can ya eh?
played d&d once, dwarf paladin, DM immediately dropped me down a hole that was deeper than I was tall, without rope
kirzstryfe: ahahaha
IshBestPony are you Canadian?
Canadian_Brony no eh
13[00:32] [@Shizuka] what are we watching
League of Legends.
IshBestPony that would explain why you are overusing "Eh?"
Shizuka: were watching ^
he was a little pissed that he thought I was going out with the girl he liked (she had no interest in him) and that I was stealing his former best friend
Eh
04DEGRASSI
04IS THE BEST CANADIAN SHOW
04OKAY
04DEGRASSI HIGH, 1990'S
OKAY
I would give you an entire essay about "Eh?" If i wanted to
You never play LoL Shizuka
In memory all those who died in the Alien invaison...
?
btw this is the only pic i has of val http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/ValthePony.jpg
13nope
13to me
kirzstryfe: then why the fuu were you playing a game that he could easly kill you in?
13it is one giant clusterbuck
Ghosties never heard of it
TBH
04:I
the guy and the girl were both good friends of mine, so we were all playing
I dunno why but I thought it might be your kinda game.
04Well, no big deal
lol poor val...angry at everything
Canadian_Brony you have five hours to do a 500 word essay on it, chop chop eh
and Trixie, that's his basic character model
Ohai Canadian_Brony :0
:)
04My Geology teacher last semester was Canadian; one of the coolest professors I've ever met
and kirz went poof
in what year was ID4 supposed to have occured?
13i don't like having to split my focus so much
13this looks like micromanagement hell to me
Ghosties, what about Undergrads?
IshBestPony I have one typed out about Canadain stereotypes
It's less complicated than it looks.
13it's why i never play engineer in tf2... you have to focus intensely on every single pixel on the screen because they are all spies out to kill you
Shizuka: you are onlu controlling the big ones
That's very true.
IshBestPony I also have a book called "How To Be A Canadian *even if you are already one"
04What about Undergrads?
Shizuka: woulndt that make your sentry and glove a spy?
13just not fun to have to juggle that much information
what's an Undergrad?
Well, champions are all built into damage/tank/support/ranged/melee sort of sets and your job is to use them effectively, that means using the abilities and spending gold on items properly.
. . . did my chat derp?
1
2
13see... in tf2.. you can still be useful with only the stock weapons..
3
4
This music
sup bros, hows it goin?
It's not really the same kind of item setup.
there we go
you have a nice house
chat derp
In LoL it's all passive +50 deathray or whatever.
hi brony_swan
There are some on-use items but for the most they're stat sticks.
Canadian_Brony we saw you fine. you just didn't give us time to respond
04HAHA
yeah the items only give bonus's...or such...only a few items that have useses
04Canadian_Brony got kicked XD
Mutterguy really? Huh.
04For simply checking to see if his chat was functioning properly XD
OMG LoL
Is funny though
Ghosties so what? I reseted the chat
Imma hipster
who is he running?
somewhat
Kill mobs, get xp, level up, unlock/upgrade skills. Each champion only has 4 skills including an ultimate and they're all fairly easy to understand.
Welp
04You a hipster? Where's your fedora?
Meanwhile: dont forget the passive and summoner spells
Ghosties: Fedoras are too mainstream.
except lee sin
:[dark court in session!!! any pony over 18 say YAY!! if not say Neigh!!!
he is an ass
:p
Yayneigh.
Problem?
he and kick your ass into the nexus and WIN
Indeed. One ability has a passive affect until used during which time the passive takes a while to return.
YAY!!!
04Whatcha getting at, pony_9944
yay
00,10My fedora is on my Scout.
yeah! Hipsters wear propeller hats now
Ghosties somewhat. I listen to Simple Plan, watch MLP: FiM, and don't have my jeans far down enough for everyone to see my boxers
13rain rain~<333
hai Rain
And summoner spells are pretty much the same except not unique for champions, rather you pick the ones you want from a list at the start of the match.
Sumica, stylin'.
Allo Rain.
Guys
I have bad news
MLP is now mainstream
hello everybody
oh hai Rain
PinkiePieCopy no, it's MANESTREAM
I'd get into runes and flim flam but it'd be pointless because I fail at LoL anyway.
04Do you were thick rimmed glasses too, or tight button up shirts?
Canadian_Brony: Oh mmhkay
DIs song.
I knows it.
oh god not runes
I am PinkiePieCopy.
nice i think
i has no runes :p
here have .04% speed increase....for idk...800 ip? yeah sounds good

I'm summoner level like, 7.

04Well...fuck, we're like 30 years behind
Meanwhile: im like 16
i declare Shizuka the queen of the neeeeeeerd.
Yeah, I don't play much because the people on it make me cry.
Ghosties no and no. SOMEWHAT
Shit... now I feel old.
yeah that game...its rage bait
I'm 15
buck yeah
When I do play it's usually 1v1 with bots and a friend, and she steamrolls me every time anyway.
Meanwhile: yeah i do that too
dammit! Please don't tell me the stream is derping on me again!
How are we 30 years behind?
I've givne my age out enough times.

in vegas, yeah everyone under 21 does suck
0,14awww yeah, I'm exempt
I shouldn't be saying that because I'm fresh out the teenage years. It's probably because the teens you see today have no sense of "This is dangerous, let's not do it"
oh in Vegas?
Oh god I SOUND OLD
yeah he needs that alot....to prod the douches in mane
You know what's fun? Fire. You know what's more fun? A lot of fire. :D

AttackPony: you arent old honey, you is barely old enough to drink
you're point is invalid
"What happens in Vegas, stays on Youtube."

13nopony has even heard of riven here..
And I didn't even say hello yet
ShizukaI'm watching it, actually. Just unsure what it really is.
I watched
/me hugs Polydunami "mIRC helps"
Shizuka: I've hear of riven
True
cant wait to watch sum fireworks at the park :$
it was one of the myst cames
*games
I switched to Nettalk however.
My chat is messing up
hope it dosent rain on the 4th like last year -_-''
riven was a sequel to myth if i remember right
myst
Myst.
In fact I can't see who pinged me well refresh time
Rain: why not?
I gotta tell my dad I'm a brony sometime soon. Because when I gots pony shirts I want to wear them to when I go to Theme Parks with him :S
has been over 100 deg F for the past 3 weeks
and not a drop of rain
FINALLY!
13there was lots of rain last night... for a few minutes...
that's because it's all down here!!!
13then it was just hot..
Rain: but why no fireworks?
Dang it lost all my pms
bet that didnt help the humidity
http://youtu.be/pvKWW6eSrso
Shizuka I've gotten lotsa rain
ah the secret brony sencrome
Rain: everything :o
finally got to hear the magical sound of thunder again today:P
BOOM

Ah mah dad will find out one day that I'm a brony. ONE DAY -_-

G'night Cobellanez
Good Night
13ja .-.
night
13at least we have power..
you should do one of those....as long as asuka is fine and doesnt melt
13if the power went out i would just curl up and die..
/me pats Shizuka
oh I know exactly what you mean, Shizuka
Shizuka I know that feel, bro
I think I would litterally cook if the power went out @___@
Shizuka: you would die with no power :D, i would also :$
Shizuka: I would die without my power O_O
13there is that too....
Polydunami Y U give me your weather? All it is here is rain, rain, and more rain
13part of my brain dies when there is no power...
13i don't really talk to anyone in meatspace... even with my parents it's rare...
That reminds me of the time an icestorm nocked out the power for 2 weeks that was not fun
I'm going to see the forecast for my area.
13my dogs hear me talk more..
just imagine a worldwide power outage for 3 days :o
My mom says I spend way to much time on my computer. What? I only spend over 11 hours on it :P
hmm just like live free, die hard
13only over 11
13>wake up
or die free and live hard
13>internet
13>bed
Im the same way, Shizuka. I think a total of 12 people have ever heard me talk
i spend half of day sleeping :$
oh oops
Shizuka: What about eating?
Shizuka unless it's during school hours. Last time I had a power outage was during school hours. We all get sent home early and power is on in my house.
13when i remember to..
Shizuka: everypony who's played with me has heard me talk ;p
thank god for summer vacation :3
one of them thought I was a mute and almost freaked out when I spoke
1
. . . chat derp
13i had that happen a lot..
13like a lot a lot..
:$ heh
Okay, this is hilarious. Apparently it's going to be sunny the rest of the week for me.
Shizuka: Here's my morning/after I wake up. Crawl outta bed into mah computer chair start up computer log on to #bronystate and other (squee) the end :)
*afternoon
Why can't I be in Chicago or Minneapolis at this time? :(
People get wird reactions when I speak. They respond with "Dude that is not what your voice would sound lik"
Polydunami: I live in Wisconsin :p
I thought ^
Ponies47: Same here.
BYE :)
Oh my
13wake up.. log the time.. downstairs.. asuka on, connect irc.. brush hair.. stop moving until i need to..
AttackPony: WHAT! :O
So how about those Packers? :3
meh thinks 20 hrs on the com is giving mah head some pians
Ponies47: Get up, BronyState all day long
Ponies47 My parents will be gone in a month for a couple weeks, leaving me alone in the house. During that time, I plan to become nocturnal
thank god for high metabolism, right Shizuka? :3
Shizuka: I never brush my hair :P
my current schedule is wake up, then minecraft, then youtube, then bronystate, and sleep :$
13ja..
AttackPony: Yep :P

Canadian_Brony: I see
/me Listens to RUBBAHFUIT for the 100th time
What? It's funny! :d
I can't find my yoyo. wake up shower brush teeth internet guitar internet sleep
Ponies47: Actually, Bronystate all night because when I got to bed, I just add Zzz to the end of my name while I'm still logged in and go to sleep with the stream playing
Sleep, read, eat, ponies, read, sleep. REPEAT
And I thought I had free time. Well, it IS summer...
time to resume my ponies :$
bronystate... yay.... gah mah h34d hurts 84d
I dream ponies which I don't know if its good or bad
http://youtu.be/pJk-xvnKeKE
i have yet to dream of ponies
got desktop ponies?
What the hell?
AttackPony: I just shut off my computer and log off. I use to put my computer into stand by and keep me logged in as Ponies47|Sleep but then I found putting my computer in stand by doesn't lock it. So when I started it up no password screen which is a big problem because my step brother is always trying to get on it for no reason -_-
Lightning-Quill depends. I dreampt I met a Pegasister in one of my dreams. The next day, I met a girl in school I actually liked. Go figure.
Ponies47: That's smart.
AttackPony: Yeah. I hate my step brother and my step sisters -_-
I got desktopponies 2.4 and 1.5
1.4 not 2.4
Hello i JUST STARTED TO GET IN TO MLP
Ponies47 I have 1 little sister. It is her sole purpose in life to annoy me and be loved for it.
Oh yeah. Bronystate is the place I usually go to when I have nothing else to do.
pegasister....
Also, welcome to Bronystate xMLPxREACTORx!
hi zMLPxREACTORx welcome to the herd

Hello xMLPxREACTORx. Welcome to BronyState! You'll procrastinate forever
Rain I understand how you would see that
Indeed
LOL sooo true
I prefer to be called a Brony
Canadian_Brony: My step brother and step sisters have the same purpose -_-
being called pegasister feels like I am being excluded from something >_>
xMLPxREACTORx http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
I don't really care about being called a brony myself.
Rain: I gotta agree. I thi nk everypony male or female should just be called brony
*think
why don't we just stick to brony as being unisex meaning used for both genders
Oh hey a new Brony
thats what I use it as
note: wat is the female = of a brony?
My name's CrimsonPhoenix
I hate everything
pony_9944 brony >_>
CrimsonPhoenix: So you hate us? :(
xMLPxREACTORx: My name is AttackPony or AttackWithHugs
So you hate MLP
so would my friend be considered a brony if he likes the characters and fan made music, but he dosent watch the show?
Hate is useless to me.
Of course I hate you guys and especially you. I hate you the most.
pony_9944 unoficailly "Pegasister". Some just prefer brony. Tomato tomato (both prononciations are hard to do in text)
Stupid lampost

Well, that was incredibly eventful.
Times go fast when you're at lan party.

YEAH:D
oh yeah, happy 4th of july for every US bronies out there :)
/me celebrated 3 days ago
Good morning I shall communicate with you all later
I celebrated my country's independence three days ago too. I celebrated by giving blood :3
. . .
oh flootershai your so shy :D
. . . I found a can of Coca-Cola . . .
note is poisinjoke bad for us two legs???
I might go donate blood, there is red cross van every other month here for that purpose, but I think my blood type is the worst for donation (AB+) :(
pony_9944 yes, yes, yes, and YES
I would become . . . MAINSTREAM
MAIN
so anyway, got to spend some time with my niece the other day.
^keyword
/me hates needles :|
is there any other sites like this
she's 20 months old, and she already has a favorite pony.
I'm afraid so, Alchemist: no other blood type can have your blood.
unfortunately, it's a G3 pony lol
13except AB+?
hen3ry: :3c doesn't matter she's too young
I DID say no OTHER blood type... didn't I? :S
Ohei Shizuka!
13never learned how the + and - fit into the can receive..
+ people can take + or - blood.
13we only learned the base letters.. O is universal donor, AB universal recipient
- people can only take - blood
needles!!!!!!!!!??
PolyDurian: the red blood cells, I think they could still use my plasma and any other type can receive plasma from my blood.
That's quite true, Shizuka.
http://youtu.be/HOe1aVRjb_4
Great song
/me does not know his bloodtype
hate them blood sucks!!!!!!!
13and if + can take + or -, shouldn't someone who's AB+ be able to take AB+? :3c
from what I know, there's A+, A-, B+, B-, AB, and O
13i think mine is A+.. i forget
Shizuka: you can _always_ take the exact same blood as you already have...
if I'm wrong, don't blame me
So yes, AB+ can take AB+
13saw my birth certificate like exactly once..
AB+ can take any blood, it's the universal acceptor.
O- can be given to anyone, making it the universal donor.
/me is O- :3
Anybody on?
hmm.. whats the rarest blood type anyways?
just checked , im O - , CcD.ee , Kell neg. whatever all that means!
a +
i think
pony_9944: AB apparently :D
wooo blood types!
I'm IB positive. I be positive ain't nobody stikin' no needle in me!
Rarest is AB-
second rarest is B-
im just an O
Most common are A+ and O+
i though o was the rarest
JUST an O, pony_9944?
13i'm just a O.. yes i'm only a O
positive
Nope. O- isn't even that rare, it's just in very very high demand.
O+ however is the most common
04I'm straight up G, yo!
http://bloodcenter.stanford.edu/about_blood/blood_types.html
04Hardcore, fo lyfe!
13ogg lock
im just easy blood.... wahhhh!!!!
welcome back Ghosties
http://youtu.be/0kFT4iEE3k8
y u leave?
True, O- is not so rare, although I know only about seven percent of the Canadian population have it.
Hullo Ghosties!
In the US, it's 6.6% according to the source I just linked
hay Ghosties
I'm IB positive. I be positive ain't nobody stikin' no needle in me!
04I leave because the streets be calling me, dawg
peace out
no problem with needles if they go into my arms/legs/buttocks etc. I hate it when they try to stick a needle in my mouth.
And yeah, since O- is the universal donor, it can be used in emergencies like births (ESPECIALLY premature births) or car accidents when the blood type can't be checked right away.
11,02HXC
hi SuperBrony64
11,02Hai ^-^
dat SuperBrony64
There are instances though when the docs have to use type specific blood as far as i know.
Hey SuperBrony64, B+.
well i gotta go... 21 hrs on ta net is really not gud 4 ma mind metink
11,02You b dawg dat shit is for real mofo
ja ne
Google is still celebrating the "111th Anniversary of the Worlds Longest Covered Bridge"
whey they have to match exact types, that's usually for more invasive things like transplants. For simple blood transfusion, you can always give O-negative whenever there's any doubt
g'night pony_9944
11,02What are we all doing? :3
Google celebrates EVERYTHING. Maybe it's run by Pinkie Pie?
13discussing blood
discussing blood. Now, 1873 Romanian, that was a fine vintage...
11,02Mine is red.
SuperBrony64 discussing blood transfusiongs
I'm IB positive. I be positive ain't nobody stikin' no needle in me!
http://youtu.be/l2X_D3ixlFI
I just used the same quote 3 times here . . .
GIVE ME YOUR FRIENDCHIPS
yes you did
I dunno, SuperBrony64. When they took blood out of me, it was more of a darkish purple.
11,02O.O
mine has a slight green tint to it I think. Either that, or I've been staring at the screen too long
04He's a dark alien overlord. Kill him now.
dat nick.
lol
11,02That's because your hemoglobin lacks oxygen ^.^
I wonder if Spike has a scrotum or if his testicles are stored inside his body.
Polydurian that blood was deoxygenated
AKA, they took it from your vein
No, it's because it's the blood from my VEIN.
Yeah
04Man, you guys
*a vein
04Jesus
Even with my dad having a much better computer it derps from time to time. Back :)
11,02Dat Ghosties ban
Ghosties yes?
I noticed. But what can *I* do? :-P
04Not you guys, that...guy
04Bleh

Don't worry about it, Canadian_Brony.

yes, that was it I'm sure.

SuperBrony64 http://fav.me/d5615c9 what do you think of this?
http://youtu.be/n8Z6qiA0GR8
KiwiBoi777: if 15°C is half as hot as 30°C, then how many times is 0°C hotter than -50°C? trollface.jpg
you'll never be the Element of Petty Theft, Canadian_Brony.
Alchemist fifty
cher3ry I've known that for years
Alchemist: 50 degrees
Alchemist: your premise is wrong. Use Kelvin. :-P
cher3ry: we have a winner :)
brb. I'm going to take a different approach . . .
Canadian_Brony It's a trap!
I didn't go get three degrees to get caught by troll physics :D
I'm going to bed ,you guys. Nigth
/me hugs the chat
night AttackPony|Zzz!
nite nite AttackPony|Zzz
/me hugs AttackPony|Zzz
Okay, I think I found the reason for Spiderman's inception in Ponyfanon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOb961sYXF8
and i guess im doin the same, later yall
If there is 20 degrees in my room and 3 degrees outside, I like to open the window to let those 3 additional degrees inisde :D
That'll be- *puts﻿ on sunglasses* 8 BITS! :P
(Rimshot)
thats so big words :D
. . .
:p
/me grumbles curses under his breath
Canadian_Brony get caught?
04Spiderman's been around in the fandom for much longer than Read It and Weep
Canadian_Brony: What happened?
Actually Polydurian my theory is 4chan
A wild Ghosties appeared!
Oh yeah?
cher3ry: if you want troll physics listen to kent hovind.
Goodness sake, 4chan.
Biglaw yes, but I got away. I didn't have a can on me, and it's easy to lie to someone who's half asleep
04He was around since I became a brony, when a poster on Ponychan was posting as Spiderman
I have never watched 1960's Spiderman :$
Spider thread were around everywhere and while it amused the people in MLPG they possibly made crossover pics
Alchemist: no thanks, I already have to deal with troll medicine on an annoyingly common basis.
Ponies47 WHAAAAT
Ponies47 I failed trying to grab a can of Coca-Cola from downstairs without being notiched. Twice
04This was March or April of 2011
what type of pony would you want to be
ROUND 3!
Canadian_Brony: YOU FAILED! boooooooooooooo booooooooooooo
I would be a pegasys!
pegasus*
derp
Actually I remember Spider thread for a good long while ago
:p
Ghosties: then bless Spiderman :D
Ponies47 STFU, this one will work!
Heck I think before MLP
I garuntee!
btw whats the meaning of the whole spiderman meme in mlp? does it even have one, or is it just something that exists?
Biglaw: I have never watched 1960's Spiderman :$
Canadian_Brony: Sorry :(
What's the meaning of memes in general, Alchemist?
Ponies47 WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
the origin to combine the two though is undefined
Biglaw: You heard me :$
/me wasn't around to see Ponies47's reply
Ponies47: it's goofy as shit and it's hilarious :D
MadSurge: How long did it run?
No idea
Alchemist that's just it though, people knew spiderman was funny and with everything even spiderman got pony crossover
Canadian_Brony: I said 'Sorry :('
it was probably a big hit and spread
I dunno, you'd think shows would get tired after all that running...
Polydurian: the ones I saw are usually make fun of certain situations (like foulf bachelor frog, good guy greg etc)...
hmmm. Maybe I should watch an episode then :$
yes no maybe? :p
I killed the chat :(
yes
I'd say knock yourself out.
/me hugs Ponies47
but whats the point the spiderman meme trying to make and being embraced so much it wins a freaking cosplay contest at a MLP convention :D
/me Hugs KiwiBoi777 back
I often feel that way myself, Ponies47.
http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/60s-spider-man
Oh here's something interesting
it originate from /co/ like MLP
what what what
well the Bronies
Chat derp back
so yeah the origin must be back when MLPG was around /co/
hi every pony :)
Hey Quick_Thinker :)

that pic describes my situation
xMLPxREACTORx, those kind of question are best in PM for when you want to know more about a certain person
I have failed 3 times to smuggle 1 can of Coca-Cola from downstairs.
You need a new plan
sorry:'(
The third time was when I found out there is no Coca-Cola in the fridge
Don't need to be
or anywhere in the house
I'm just helping you really, those question don't get too much discussion
just jokeing:)
wow, no offense or nothin, but wow you're bad at swiping stuff. :D
/me 13finds a rain and curls up by the fireplace to sleep

04Goodnight, Shizuka

Yep.

Yep, Ghosties.
Ghosties can i haz your OC ?

MLD is over rated imo

hmm always thought wrek would have brownish hair o_O
Canadian_Brony: try using the tab button after typing the first few letters of one's name, it helps.
And how I became a brony if you're interested. http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Ninjazz
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG I tried basing it off of his dA ID
Rain, I like how you think
he is swedish, Darkts3|Drawing|MLG.
KiwiBoi777 will remember that
Once a pony hater, Applejazz was.

Applejazz I'm typing it out right now
I watched in episode of 1960's Spiderman :P

Yep, just one episode and you're initiated.
Typing what out, Canadian_Brony?
04Ah, well, welcome to BronyState! I hope you have a good time here and you enjoy your stay. Hopefully you'll become a regular ^_^
That was me with Doctor Who over the past week.
@ny 1's wunna haer the storay 0f hao I got introduced In2 Bronies?

Applejazz how I became a Brony. I'm typing it for xMLPxREACTORx
I hated ponies before I became a brony :(
^
Ghosties: do regulars get perks?

Ghosties: You know I am :P

04A regular. You know, someone who hangs out in the chat all the time
ok, not really. we get some pi tho sometimes.
like me >:D
o i really stupid
04Not like every moment of every day, but, someone that's here on the off days
I like being a regular. It's fun.
^
Ponies47: I was just indifferent :D what made you change your mind?
I'M SO HIPSTER http://www.fimfiction.net/user/CrimsonPhoenix
04And I've neeeeever met Quick_Thinker
I've become sort of an irregular visitor over time.
But now I LOVE LOVE LOVE PONIES! :)
00,02http://www.bronystate.net/paintchat/ can i get you guys to check this?
Hey Ninjazz!
well nice to meet you to Ghosties
Ghosties no one can be a regular without bronystate platinum and without going in the initiation :O
Hey there, MadSurge! *attacks with hugs*
04Nice to meet you, Thinker. Are you new here?
and i think some ponies can voutch i came here like maybe 2 weeks ago
Ghosties it was a joke, I saw a profile linked as well

Phase4 it don't work
04I didn't catch them, I jusst happened to see yours
04*just
04In any case, thanks for coming Thinker and we hope to see you here more often
Hmm... it's not working quite yet, Phase4.
I have already told my brony story. But if anypony wants to here it just ask. I don'y mind :)
I would ask to please investigate before mindlessly judge.
*don't
There was no stream and it wasn't no chat
is this like the only site for bronys
Nope.
most the time i just watch things of my own while ocassionly looking back at the chat for instance im watching PONIES the Anthology 2
xMLPxREACTORx, there's tons of site
00,02Polydurian, what os you using?
00,02Canadian_Brony, you too, same question?
what are they
My browser? Firefox.
Equestria Daily is another popular site.
00,02operating system
News stuffs.
yus
Oh. It's a Dell laptop.
Phase4 Windows XP Pro
Windows 7.
old, mind you
Ponies47: what made you change your mind about ponies? ;D
Lsoing your friends trust is the fastest way to lose a friend...
REALLY old
00,02hmmm
ForEVER.
...
bronystate, derpyboo.ru and EQD are the only mlp related sites I visit. Thats enough for me.
MLP reactor theres too many brony sites here the one most of them know Bronystate, Equestria daily and Equestria gaming
00,02Polydurian, go to about:plugins in firefox
04<CrimsonPhoenix> I would ask to please investigate before mindlessly judge. <-- I hope you're not talking to me, Phoenix. If you are what I'll tell you "it's no excuse that I didn't see theirs, I still caught yours and you should know better"
I've stopped visiting Equestria Daily lately.
me too
how come?
so anybody want to rate my fic since the stream is doing nothing>
thats like THE news portal for MLP
i never went there;)
if not im fine with it just want to know actualy bronies thought how i did XD
MadSurge: Classmate of mine convinced me to watch an epiosde. I was in solo when I did this I really wasen't hating anymore. My first episode was Lesson Zero I fell in love with the show about 5 minutes in. I spent the rest of dat weekend watch pony episode after pony episode. When I realized I was a brony you wouldn't beleave how scared I was
DAT WALL
00,02Polydurian, can you tell me what version of java you have? allso when you say it doesnt work exactly what do you meen'
:$
I had problems with the latest java release too, actually... uninstalled and went back to the last java version 6.
Ponies47: Once I heard the name "Lauren Faust" I knew it was a quality show :D
the only thin about mlp i cant see is the opening
MadSurge: Ah. I liekd Foster's :)
*liked
Hang on, I didn't realize you were talking to me, Phase4 :S
^
00,02Canadian_Brony, you too, what exactly is working/not working
well you think thats nuts watch the G1 intro XD it will kill you
00,02Polydurian, tis ok :)
What's this? about:plugins?
Ponies47: exactly. And the Powerpuff Girls :D
00,02Polydurian, its a list of plugins loaded into firefox
Phase4 I open the link and a lavendar screen appears. After that, nothing happens.
MadSurge: I loved that show to! :)
im bored so http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p-YAAK49bs&feature=related
Where would I find that?
xMLPxREACTORx you will get used to it, and then without you know it you will be singing the entire opening
MadSurge: Even with being a boy :P
00,02Polydurian, type it into the address bar
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5492/
00,02Canadian_Brony, well poo, i've had that issue and cant realy fix it :(
hi Phase4! how are you?
00,02mostly because i have no clue why it happens
00,02ohai MahBoi777 , i'm ok
Rain: O_O
Ponies47: never had the "it's for girls don't watch it" problem :D
i dont think that i will start to sing to it
Rain: WAT
Rain Spiderjack is best spider
Rain: oh my...
Dark if your bored do what i do WATCH PONIES the Anthology 2 ITS SWEET
Java(TM) Platform SE 6 U31
Phase4 I hope you find some way to fix it
Quick_Thinker: nah, ill watch some machinima
MadSurge: Yeah. Both my brotehr and I enjoyed the show my dad didn't mind us watching it either :p
Can I see that link again?
00,02Canadian_Brony, in theory its easy, in practice attaching a debugger is insanely painfull
*brother
kinda of fail but still a win XD
Rain: SpiderSparkle :D
Rain: Headpony!
00,02Polydurian, http://paintchat.bronystate.net/ ?
Phase4 tell me about it
00,02whoops
00,02Polydurian, http://bronystate.net/paintchat/ ?
Yeah
00,02the other one is nothing, ignore it
That
00,02>.>
00,02<.<
Ponies47: My dad was baffled by the amount of adult jokes in that show. And the Beatles episode :D
so anyone wanna stream or arre we gonna discuss the new adobe
MadSurge: Every show has adult jokes :p
Meh. One of these days I'll re-tell my brony story to ya'll :)
for instance Animaincs GOT TON OF ADULT HUMOR CAUSE IT TRICKED THE CENSORS
But I don't feal like it :0
:)
Ponies47: some shows have better ones though :P
Phase4, I have the applet on but I can't seem to draw anything.
Morning everypony *Yawns while hugging chat*
MadSurge: yep
00,02hmmm
Hey FairysHuff :)
Whoa
Hey there FairysHuff
Ponies47: Om Yo
Helling there, FairysHuff. Your mane is a bit, bed ridden.
Ohai FairysHuff!
00,02oh wait, Polydurian it let you log in?
mornin FairysHuff and hi Om how are you?
Yeah
heres mine i was surfing the internet bored and foundponies and deceded to not watch then watched i cant exactly remember but it had some ponies in it and i laughed at so i looked where i would find the clips watched and BAM brony
Ninjazz: MadSurge MahBoi777 Holla
Also, I can see drawings being made.
Ninjazz: Yes. It usually is ^_^
Helling? Oh mai. Hello*
00,02Polydurian, it might just be loading
MahBoi777: Going to sleep soo xD
soon
SOON
I can draw, Phase4.
tm.
lol okay
Well, not very well, but I CAN DRAW!
00,02excelent
SOOOOOONAAH!
XD
had to reconnect
Bouncy happy J-pop helps with waking up
Wait, why am I still a durian?
Name the best Fox cartoon
Better.
GO!
Also, hey FairysHuff!
so anypony want to try rating my fic if not its cool just want to know how i did in the eyes of a true brony unlike the bronies on FIMfic who just seem to be rude
Polydunami: Yo
>true brony
Not sure if there can be a "true" brony.
I mean... what is consdierd a brony?
+__(\ drat
/me Listens to What is Pootis? for the 100th time
What is a Brony?
one who is not an ass spreading kindess and joy pinkie style
Ninjazz: There can. A brony that encapsulates the virtues of the show.
A worthless pile of friendship.
WORTHLESS!?
Ninjazz: I try to do my best to do just that
^
FairysHuff, and if one just enjoys ponies?
/me Needs pony shirts to wear out in public
Ninjazz: Then their a hedge brony ^_^
god, you guys sadden me
rain i was listening to dracullas speech about what a man is and as soon as he said a miserble pile of seccrets your comment appeared CREEPY
Worst thing you can do as a fan is label someone else "not a true fan"
Polydunami, it's a reference :D please hold your rage.
the ref went right over you rheads
what would you do if you were in ponyvill
I know what the reference is, Rain.
FairysHuff, so are you saying that there are bronies that are quintisentially better than other bronies?
/me glomps Starflash
It's Symphony of the Night, correct?
hey Starflash! how are you doing?:)
Hallo MahBoi777.
ja
Pretty good :3
good!^^
well for one if i was in ponyville im sure pinkie would kill me thinking i would be able to morph back like the rest of her friends
/me is uneducated in your ways
Although I have a bunch of work to do today & stuff
Sup everypony :)
Ninjazz: Yes, obviously. If someone takes on the virtue of kindness via the show but another is just an asshole wouldn't you say that the person with kindness is better?
hi Liokin
good luck Starflash
anyone bored?
hi Liokin
So how are you MahBoi777 ?
I say the guy who made this is best brony http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw5492-13402168132442.gif
Starflash: I am doing awesome, can't wait for the weekend to get here
dude, that's creepy. </Spike>
Again, Rain, HEADPONY.
Ways you can celebrate "Derpy Day:"- Eat muffins- Hand-deliver a letter- Make derpy eyes- Wear a Derpy Hooves tee :P
MahBoi777: I can't wait for summer break to get here :T
Rain i will be haunted by that till the day i die for that i CURSE YOU >:C
FairysHuff, but that's human natue. If they are both bronies, they are bronies. One is a good brony and the other is an asshole. The difference? One is an asshole while the other is generally a nice guy/girl.
Starflash: how many more weeks do you have?
glad I could help, Quick_Thinker
I don't think I can make derpy eyes. At least, not on purpose. 6_9
i can :)
i would try to find a spell to transform me in to a alcorn of the type like luna
it feels wierd after a long time though
Ninjazz: Human nature sucks >_> Far too many assholes in the world. We need more people who take on the virtues of MLP
alicorn can backfire on you in so many ways MLP reactor
Quick_Thinker: Nice. You lucky ^_^
MahBoi777: less than one. Final exams are starting in 5 days
FairysHuff, wishful thinking.
Ninjazz: True ~_~
yeah but never fall asleep like it i learned the hard way my eyes were stuck like that for a week
/me pats FairysHuff on the back
Starflash: well I hope everything goes well for ya
Ninjazz: But nothing will change if people don't try.
how would it backfire
Ninjazz: Thankies ^_^
me too :')
:)
g'night everypony!
gnight Canadian_Brony
bay Canadian_Brony
Night Canadian_Brony
Goodnight Canadian_Brony!
Eh?
Night, British Columbian Brony.
well if it were a fanfic everyone would be sick of it quickly if it was to be bad ass you not all powerful pretty much your then a king having to look after the land so its not all raise the sun and lower the moon fun
FairysHuff, I'm sure people have given the show a chance. I know I have... but tbh, I don't do all of the virtues of MLP because it's from MLP. But because I've been taught to do it.
hen3ry, I'm the British Columbian Brony.
I believe Canadian is also from BC.
if you said "Eh?", I leave with this: http://www.flickr.com/photos/47063070@N06/4706853733/lightbox/
g'night all!
Gni... damn it.
One pony shirt I really wanna get http://www.redbubble.com/people/sirhcx/works/8913066-pinkie-pie-is-watching-you-forever <- THIS ONE! :)
Eh?
Night Can.............
SHOOT!
i wish pinkie was watching me XD
Ninjazz: People should hold the virtues naturally yes but the MLP show helps to reinforce those virtues when living in a society where lies and corruption are the way of life.
Goodness sake, does he even know that I'm Canadian as well?
wait they came out wrong
well he does if he saw the last couple lines on his screen before he quit
You gotta love that smile? :P
Time To Sleep, Goodnight everyone ~
/me watches Quick_Thinker intently O_O
a cat
gnight TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Gnight, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. Take care.
no wait, a fan, because I am on my side
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Later bro /)
See you T!
are you the RL pinkie pie Polydunami?
Ponies47: Best pony watching us? YAY
04Liokin, you've got some good drawing skills man
04I've seen some of your work, pretty neat
Ghosties: Thank you kindly sir ^-^
I'm a big Pinkie Pie fan. But I think everypony is best pony but for a few :P
Ghosties: Im always open for request if you have one.
I dunno, last time I looked in the mirror I liked what I saw ^__^
screw you dicord
Ghosties: Ships, OC redraws etc..
MadSurge: Pinkie Pie be watching with epic Twilight Sparkle smile? Guess so :P
FairysHuff, just crediting the show just because it gives off a good message is rather... silly. People can like the show for what it is but not have to follow the virtues. In the end... it's still just entertainment.
I would like to thank my Amatryptoline for my relatively good sleep.
open for requests hmmmmmm i want to ask but it will seem like being such a lazy bastard but seeing as how i cant draw for shiat
04Nah, it's fine. I just thought your Shizuka x Vi was pretty neat
Ninjazz: Thats the same as saying honesty is a quaint concept but useless.
I suck at art :(
Actually, I'm being narcissistic about that so never mind :S
well lets be honest the show also give some people some hope that all the world is not out to kill them when luck is down on them and about to finish them off
Ponies47: can only imagine what you were thinking during Twi's mental breakdown :D
Ghosties: Thanks I always appreciate comments.
04Not a problem
when i first heard of bronys i though yu were all trolls but you guy are so cool kids
(now how would i know that) I WAS TOTALLY NOT IN THAT POSITION BEFORE NAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
04>kids
fine guys
FairysHuff, are you saying that watching the show requires you to change yourself?
men
04Interestingly enough, a lot of our userbase are kids :P
Ikr?
MadSurge: Hmmmm. I wa thinking. Sheeesh this is for little girls? 6_9 And that's why I'm also a big fan of crazy Twilight! :)
mental breakdowns are very frequesnt with me
*was
can i ge that comment removed?
How so?
04Because a lot of the bronies I see now are teenagers
seriously i dont think i should have typed i have mental breakdowns offten XD
me
to
I forget when I joined the herd. But it will be 2 months on #bronystate on the 7th :0
:)
Well it's nice to see teens into ponies too <3
^
:)
Ninjazz: Not a requirement but a choice to take on the messages or not to. You can enjoy it as just entertainment but isn't that the shallow way of doing so? Or should we allow lies and corruption to be the social norm for our society? I don't think so. For example I've been actively encouraged to lie when applying for jobs. The idea sickens me.
04Feels like you've been here longer, 47
well i joined the herd but did not know about this site till i broused the web and saw PONY CHAT REACTIONS TO DERPY
/me yawns "morning everypony"
mornin EggWhite
same here, it was a youtube walk that clued me into bronystate's existence.
and then looked at the site and decided ehhh why not lets jump in this
am i in the herd wait what is the herd
Morning EggWhite :0
no clue XD
:)
okay to be honest
so i herd you like herds so i got you a herd you can herd while u herd... nevermind.
How is everypony doing on this fine day?
its our term for welcomeing you as a official brony
FairysHuff, this is a kid's show we are talking about. Not the cure to society's troubles. If I want to sit down at the end of a day and want to smile, I'll watch ponies. I don't watch ponies to be reminded that the world sucks.
xMLPxREACTORx http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3709/
We all love ponies right? But aren't there somtimes we're we just wanna say confound these ponies! I do :P
Ninjazz: Kids are the cure to societys troubles.
pfffft
>.>
kids are a part of the troubles
I hate little kids! :[
KIDS ARE TEH FUTURE
And bad mothers are the cause of society's problems, then?
heheh ^_^ And I thought I was cyncial.
One question: what is the CAUSE of society's troubles?
/me hugs FairysHuff
Polydunami, Monay.
Ninjazz: *Hugs*
I got Ninjazz'd.
...Flash crashed...again.
I'm a verb? XD
well i want ponies to spread to as many things a possible even once took my own liberty to spread the brony love to the COD community man did that back fire in my face like Aqua Puria (Aqua Puria is highly acidic water that has been known to kill most people AND IM NOT TELLING HOW TO MAKE IT)
Polydunami: The cause of societys troubles is this promotion of selfish greed and many other unsavoury characteristics which are seen as norm now.
Who promotes all of that, then?
yeah but if you try to spread hapiness it seems that your rejected and tohught as strange
Polydunami: Society itself. It spreads like a disease
http://www.redbubble.com/people/wesleyfung2/works/8757205-confound-these-ponies-insomnia <- MY KIND OF SHIRT! :D
Quick_Thinker: Exactly
Ninjazz: one sec let me check with Sweetie Belle.
Because crazy Twilight is on it :P
Speaking of RedBubble MLP shirts. Mine have finally been shipped. Should arrive by next week I hope.
seriously i did the craziest thing i have ever done i TOOK over my schools announcements for a long time and after a awhile i gained the schools love but as soon as i played SMILE via itercom i got beat up and thrown off a roof
Okay, then. What is a society comprised of?
EggWhite, will do.
FairysHuff: Gald to here
Quick_Thinker: OUCH! >_<
so in all reality Ponys have done much more for me than humanity and that is SAD
Polydunami: People who look to get the best they can for themselves. Usually by stepping on others to get it.
Hola did i miss ponies?
Ponies47: As am I
Or is it a movie
Hey Quick_Thinker, who MADE those ponies?
well Humanity kind of made ponies
Hey DerpyHooves_Lova :)
humanity has just looked on me and brushed me off as a useless parasite
Laurn Faust
why?
Ninjazz: Sweetie Belle says no but she will add you to the next version.
FairysHuff: I gotta order some shirts. They got to many good ones! :d
EggWhite, Yay~ :D
Ponies47: Yuss... far too many good ones. I limited myself to just two shirts. But theres were a great many more I wanted.
Im hoping i get a I <3 derpy shirt soon
Well, don't you think Lauren Faust is a part of humanity?
hell in a way i kinda of felt Twi's insanity in lesson zero no one belive me that a girl was cheating on my best friends and it back fired in the biggest way ever
Is it ponies or a movie, If its ponies im missing them D:
:S
nothing is streaming
Oh
lol
Okay, this really bugs me. Do you think you're not part of the humanity you seem to berate?
You know I think I have Insomnia. Because when I'm at my moms and poeple come into my room I get mad very easy. Maybe I should stop going to bed at like 4:00 AM :S

FairysHuff: EPIC

Ponies47: Yuss ^_^

Ghosties: Sigh...Why do the great ones always sell out.
Let ponies come to you. Don't chase after ponies.
it takes time why not watch some PMVs or some pony things people make
Anywho later everypony /)
04...are you talking about The Big Show from WWE?
Sorry EggWhite, you need a Bronystate Gold Account to fix the stream.
/me fails and explodes.
300085 times
Ghosties: Who else would I be talking about? -lol
is the stream bad for you all or just me?
I will pay any price for this...Gold Account.
DerpyHooves_Lova, sometimes there's simply nothing on the stream and we have to live with it.
for instance to stop me from going on a murderious rampage i listen to smile everyday NO ONE CAN RESIST IT so i think thats whats stopping me from trying to kill all the assholes in my school ..... that was crepy then i thought it would be
DerpyHooves_Lova. Nobody is streaming. we keep saying that.
Wait just a minute this sounds familier
If derpy is a mane six charecter in season three i will break my tv screaming yes
Quick_Thinker, that was not creepy
04I didn't know you liked WWE, Liokin
DerpyHooves_Lova: If you count the days until season 3 starts, YOUR GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME
huh >:?
Oh I remember I signed u for the Ponibooru Gold Account.
up
DerpyHooves_Lova, how could she be part of the main /SIX/ when there is already six of them?
no he will go insane it hasnt even been told yet if im correct
Ghosties: Talk with me sometime bro /) you'll find out a lot more about me -lol But im gonna head off for a little now. We'll have to chat some other time.
OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh

well i read the shit and just am taking precaution
... Wait, is this "Lavender Town 'Missing Frequencies' Mystery" video supposed to be dangerous?
i havent heard hte muisc ever since actully playing the real
I think that's just a creepypasta, Quick_Thinker.
its really repeative]
yes it should be it had a requienciy only kids and young teens could hear apparntly
Polydunami, there's a part where the music goes weird with the frequency design making the ghost sprite in pokemon
that's it
and Quick_Thinker you got it wrong
you think that repititve but imagine being a kid and playing it for the first itme ever and being terrified (so yeah i was one of those kids who got mentally scarred
there's was apparently something missing that his friend could catch since he was some sound major guy in college
Yep, sounds like a creepypasta to me.
oh i thought you had linked the actual one not that thing
it is a creepypasta
heheheheh :$
you have any other muic like that
Hang on, what do you mean, "actual one"?
Quick_Thinker, that IS the video I posted

11,02Quick_Thinker: ;~;
Those are the best kind~
SuperBrony64 so, did you see the picture I drew?
i like the mints ones more than anytihng

11,02Biglaw: Yesh :3
SuperBrony64: http://fav.me/d5615c9
I would just like to say that I loves anime.
well the internet is a nice and beatufil place kinda of like a minefield if you dont go boom you beyond happy however if you go boom well thats it
I just listened to Linkin Parks new album, and I must say its pretty good...
It could've turned out better :I
the picture
Reactor, I liked the finale. Really awesome use of disappointment in change.
I like anime, but I mainly read manga.
You're new sister in law is an evil bitch.

:D
11,02:D
Best. Night. Ever.
yes we are
well guys im going before i realize that im talking to internet people on 4 th of july ( i feel pathetic right now ) :'(
The last link I put up is a comedy anime based on the Cthulhu Mythos ^_^ So funny
11,02FlareChaser: Why? :3
SuperBrony64: Why, I feel welcomed here still. :3
Anime always hurts my ears.
night everypony
FairysHuff, that is the most hilarious synopsis of an anime I have ever heard xD
Quick_Thinker: Don't feal bad. Goodnight :)
11,02FlareChaser: Ofc you will be, you're the coolest :D
:O
Polydunami: But true ^_^ And even more hilarious than it sounds.
Thanks, SuperBrony64! :D
SuperBrony64 :( but... I thought you said I was?
11,02^.^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C5LJHXrO0o Anime based on the freaking Cthulhu Mythos xD
Silly Biglaw, everyone is the coolest!
the only thing did not get about the s2 finale was when pink one use magis so he would love her that means she is not any different then that evil queen
Which one is based on Cthulhu, then?
FlareChaser but... If everypony is cool, nopony is!
11,02Everypony is the coolest who comes here on a regular basis. ^.^
Polydunami: The actual Cthulhu god itself?
then we're all cool noponies. ;)
whats cthulhu
11,02Indeed :3
In a strange way, I dig what you're saying. But then again, the changling was supposed to be pure control.
xMLPxREACTORx, she used the power of love to snap him out of a trance.
Yeah, Cthulhu himself
IDK, that is a little strange.
Well, that change was fast :P
Or it :S
SuperBrony64 yay! And what did you think of the picture?
*itself
11,02Biglaw: Awesome!! I faved it ^-^
SuperBrony64 yay!
It could be say a spell of ICY HOT. Icy to dull the pain then hot to relax!
/me hugs SuperBrony64
Polydunami: I believe he's an end of season boss I'd expect. The main character is the girl with silver hair who is the god of "Crawling Chaos" ^_^ I can't spell the actual name
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93kBPeH1w8c&feature=g-all-u CRUSH KILL DESTORY SWAG!
Cadence can be found in any cold and flu aisle.
Boys have swag, Gentlemen have class
04^
Nyarlathotep, huh?
/me hates that word, "swag"
Rain, he was already out of the trance when she did her love spell thing.
Ia Ia Chtulhu f'taghn!
she used it to snap him out and then used it again to boost his spell
Polydunami: Yes, that one I can't spell. There are other gods from the Cthulhu Mythos in the anime as well
I understand
YEEEEEEEEEEEES
also, chrysalis doesnt force anybody to love her. she just disguises herself as someone who they already love
I may have to watch again, but I think the changling revealed herself after the real Cadence showed up.
OROCHIMARU!
BABY
Missed ya
For some reason, when it's 5 in the morning, my mind is a lot more logical
and focused
:I
Biglaw: you feel that change?
its a nice change.
Then what about that spell she used to make Shining Armor's eyes to go all 6 . 9
FlareChaser I call it the "Up All Night" effect
Polydunami: http://youtu.be/RQtqkxv609A
Biglaw: now, you see....chicken.
huh , get a website offline for the stream window . is there anything on atm ?
Well, well, well. That's an Elder God for you.
04No, Trixie
04The stream is offline
streamers need their sleep too
LOL
what?
streamers are just bandsof colored paper , what do they need sleep for ?
Yeah we all need are sleep :p
fuck trixie
Dor some reason, I love this time of day. It's just barely dark out
they do a lot of waving around, TrixieBaconMuffin. its tiring work
for*
http://youtu.be/tImkmgODoC0
Rain, I think you're just pulling stuff out of your ass there.
FanCamp that would be amazing to see
wait
no
ew
FanCamp. I was talking about how TrixieBaconMuffin was making a joke about the word "streamers"
I was going along with the joke
Okay, I got to the creepy part of this "Missing Frequencies" thingy.
lol
I think listening to "Smile Song" on loop is contributing to me being awake
weed i keep me awake
jk
When it first started, my head felt all tingly.
I was talking about the season finale and Chysalis, Rain.
llo
lol
btw , what anime were you discussing back there with mythos gods in it ?
Nyarko-san: Another Crawling Chaos
FanCamp. you are not good with phychology are you? If you notice at the end when she reveals herself, armor just stands there. he isnt loving. he is just a vegetable
/me is lip singing Smile Song :D
what pony would fuck and why
and he nods in agreement when she adresses him
Yep, Nyarlathotep is the cutest elder god I've ever seen :3
http://youtu.be/8vu6SOEnF7M
you clearly have not yet seen the chtulhu plushy
SAND CANYON.
wat.
BASS CANNON
WUBWUBWUB
Yeah, just looked up the part. Yeah, she does snap him out of a trance and the whole him being a slave after being weakened. But how is that big enough to use the word "phychology"?
Hmm, I think I could compare this show to Oh My Goddess.
Ok I'm done linking videos of awesome animes now. You can all go back to staring at mr hypno circle in the stream ^_^
What with a strong goddess falling for the average male lead and all.
Polydunami: Oh My Goddess is much more tame than Nyarko
I guess big words are not something you enjoy? I could have said brain workings
Never said that was a BAD thing...
>wat
But both sides have their pluses for me.
Polydunami: Neither did I ^_^
You truly are a card there Mr. Algae studier.
Aka Rain.
>Mr
nope, sorry try again
04Fuck the mole boss on Donkey Kong Country Returns >:O
also, Algae studier?
is there a site were i can go read fanfictions for mlp
Rain, I think you were just called a card :3
try fimfiction
Oh! Oh! Can I be the wild card?
thanks
Especially since it's entertainment of a trance. Which really isn't possible unless you're a hypochondriac.
Fine, just don't make a mess :|
:)
what? FanCamp?
You don't know the meaning of phycology, Rain.
are you just saying stuff to make yourself look like you kinda know what you are talking about?
what was the site name again
Yellop again everypony.
That's fimfiction.net
The same could be said to you, Rain.
thanks agiain
maybe, exept I do know what I am talking about
Okay then, explain to me how an outside imposed trance is possible.
I'm going to be a couple of minutes.
11,02Ghosties: IKR
what are the movies for friday movie night
11,02Road to El Dorado and Robin Hood: Men in Tights
hmm. assuming we are talking about Shining Armor's trance that chrysalis put him in, I would have to answer with
did you not see her use magic to put him in one?
Oh hey SuperBrony64, durian?
You're kidding me right?
do i really need a ancount
thats bullshit
also, in the real world, sugestive hypnotism
11,02EggWhite: Yesh please :3/
and no Im not kidding you. you obviously dont watch the show if you didnt notice that she used magic to put him in a trance
Why is the hypno circle in stream telling me to kill? O_o
Suggestive hypnotism? How do you do that?
/me gives SuperBrony64 a giant o durians
/me noms on durians :3
...
Chicken.
Lucky, SuperBrony64 :S
excuse me for typing slowly
Pichonko
Seriously, Rain. You are a weiner. I went and double checked and gave credit to what you said as to Cadence breaking SA out of a trance.
/me gives Polydunami a durian
11,02I wish I had real durians to try :/
ever whisper into someone's ear while they sleep?
Ever give someone a roofie?
Sorry misa don't have any real ones :(
No, I want to eat one for real. With my mouth.
Or get them liqoured up?
yes
no actually
nope
You know, something that isn't in a T.V. show?
i have like boss
stoned and or drunk is not hypnotised :\
But it does weakened their will.
And they are more likely to be okay with what you ask of them.
no it makes them loose their inhabitions
Well... This is interesting chat. Think I'll go watch anime ^_^ Nyrako crawling chaos here I come.
But full control out of the blue would be Scopolamine.
FanCamp and Rain said pretty much the same thing at the same time.
Testing Testing 1 2 3, 3 2 1 gnitset gnitset.
Ok my nick did change... ignore me.
Yaaay, light :p
just hear that word recently, eh?
happy fourth of july everypony
Which word? And why?
meh, whatever. this argument is going nowhere
Because you're losing?
pfffft
arguing is not a contest
Huh what argurment people were arguing?
I didn't notice.
and who's winning?
charlie sheen is winning
So says the fellow who says I don't watch the show in solemn victory of the word phycology
Lone_Lycan, in an argument, the spectators win.
also, when debating something, being the loudest does not mean you are right.
yay, i win!
I'd still love to hear what your suggestive hypnotism is.
Rain parlement disagrees with you...
its suggesting something to someone in a way that makes them believe it was their idea, not yours
Other than "whispering in someones ear when they're asleep."
Ok I'm gonna start an argument, umm platonic chess is better then Renkoshima
than
SuperBrony64 well, now I see a nice amount of light coming to the room, and I am happily enjoying the Smile Song :3 moo
Successful All Nighter
/me 00,02hugs SuperBrony64
/me hugs everypony
Anyone going to say something in Renkoshima's defence?
11,02Biglaw: Yay :D Moo :3
/me hugs Phase4 back :3
Rain, that sounds about right, but I'm still not convinced of your understanding of it.
/me is hugged and hugs back
/me hugs Biglaw back
/me :3
I think I saw this movie, Rain
EggWhite|DurianTrade ignorance kind of leaves me out of the debate
as it should
11,02all the wub ^-^
You don't know what Renkoshima is!?
/me nomz on SuperBrony64
FanCamp, that was like saying "oh I know what it is, but why dont you explain it just so I know that /you/ know what it is"
/me is nommed on O.O;;
Oh ho, so the evidence table has turned, has it Rain?
/me gives SuperBrony64 a cupcake
Mutterguy, that doesnt stop most people :D
11,02:D
/me noms on cupcake :3c
oh no no
Im not suggesting that, FanCamp
or platonic chess which i assume is chess without sex but assume there has to be some difference between platonic chess and conventional chess
Really?
Im just saying that Im going to stop here
because I have arguments like this all the time
and it almost always ends with "I troll u"
Biglaw we should combine my durian with you cupcake to give SuperBrony64 a durian cupcake!
your
11,02:O
Because I'll bring something up that'll wallop you?
nope
Well. most people aer doing it wrong!
/me motherofgod.jpg
Can we?
because most people run out of things to argue with
Neat trick.
ikr?
Rain I beg to differ!
/me has made an argument
get shown up and then redeam yourself by saying you were trolling the entire time?
I differ to beg!
fucking einstine there
You aren't just attempting to be contradictory are you Biglaw because that's not arguing.
/me has no respect for those that do that btw
-_-
I'd say an argument is over when one party starts taunting the other.
/me wants to have a good time
Well, I was about to give you props for instigating the arguement, but now I'm convinced you're posturing.
Biglaw we can have a good time...DANCE PARTY!
Has everyone seen the argument sketch?
/me starts to dance.
I instigated? no sir/mam
.me dances
/me dance
you doubted my understanding of psychology
Yay
Oh look, a stream :3
yay a stream!!!

because even if you thought "pfft, what a load of shit" when you first heard it, later you might hear it when you are starting to doubt what you believe in, and then it is helping to reinforce that doubt
Oh boy.... Rush hour
00,02not sure what to do
Night, Flare.
So what are you guys arguing about.
I don't even know anymore :S
I see no argument here
that ended a while ago
Can we argue about pancakes then?
Yeah, I think I'm done for the night.
Phase4 have arma 2?
well first you need an argument before you can argue, EggWhite|DurianTrade
00,02Biglaw, nope
Then it's just a matter of time before they despise their guv'ment, try to quit or commit suicide.
awwww
exactly, FanCamp :D
that is how propaganda works
04Pancakes are delicious
back
04Just saying
^
Ghosties words of a true poet
Ghosties: Pancakes are so good.
Ok umm, pancakes suck durian cupcakes rock.
to each their own, EggWhite|DurianTrade ^_^
Do we have an arguement?
/me shoots down the argument
Were we arguing?
imsorry
lol
And the suggstive hypnotism can be from the young and dumb believeing their guv'ment can't be trusted as if it couldn't have been trusted in the first place.
Ghostiessssssssssssssssssssssss
oo stream
04What are you, a creeper?
maybe :3
04Pft
/me is outside of Ghosties window
see you ever pony i am geting off
I really need to stop not sleeping at night.
04Creepy ass mofo
Don't be a stranger now, xMLPxREACTORx
k
I didn't mean it Ghosties, I was just trying to start an arguement and failing at it.
04Well clearly you fail >:I
anyway, when I get my job, Im going to send you monies to get your comp fixed so we can play some damn games together
00,02Achivment unlocked: Balls
Later, xMLPxREACTORx.
Eeyup
Phase4 got some balls
lol Phase likes playing with balls i guess :3
04Because cupcakes are teh suxors compared to pancakes
"So you like playing with balls, eh?"
Ghosties oh no... Fanfic called pancakes 0_0
What about durian cupcakes?
WOAH!!!! THE SUN IS RED
04-_- No Biglaw...cupcakes...like the real food
How in the hell do you make durian cupcakes?
04^First you take a cup of flour...
and add eggs
and milk
And add it to the mix!
and sugar
I do not know but I will find out and tell everypony.
Hullo everypony!

o__o;
Ghosties is fine
Slow down there Ghosties
Well, I've hanged out with the awesome-est people on Earth, listened to the smile song on loop for a few hours, and seen a red sun. Life is good
/me gives Ghosties a cherrie
if a mod is doing it lets all do it
Why not? Cherries are good!
LOGIC
04(wait, there should have been emphasis on the 'ie' instead of the 's')
Well, do it right.
yush
Ghosties just being Ghosties.
That's like a creeper ending the word.
04The moment has passed
04It is down
The sun looks like a cherry
04*done
/me pats Ghosties on the back
chat
derp
/me chats
04I did good, yeah Ninjazz?
Chat derp back
I dunno, one time I saw a baby's face in the sun.
I was proud, Ghosties. T__T
GOD DAMN YOU UDK; I'm trying to make a GAME here, stop Crashing
Polydunami: silly, you should look closely, its a clown
So very proud. T__T
04:D
Wait, never mind. I was watching a TV show when I saw the baby's face in the sun.
/me starts to spin.
Where's DeathStar to dance on everypony's head?
Bed. :(
She headed out around 10 minutes ago.
SuperBrony64 the sun looks awesome right now, it's red :3
BED
Polydunami DOES NOT EXITST
EXIST*
/me stops spinning
But I do exist... don't I? :(
Why doesn't Polydunami exist?
Polydunami you do, beds don't
one sec
00,02that bench
00,02its slippery
/me pokes Polydunami
You exist?
hey all
Dat wonderful feel, when you crack your toes
Hey APS
... Is that a trick question EggWhite?
No.
Chat goes quiet
Well, I exist and ain't nopony ever going to convince me otherwise :|
Ok I believe you, just checking.
Well, I don't know what else to say.
I would suggest dance party but it never works.
Yeah, this is usually the time I sign off and head for bed.
Gnight, Polydunami. Sleep well.
/me yawns
And don't get all existential on me about how the bed doesn't really exist.
Good night Polydumani don't let the anti-durians bite.
Well, it's 6am
Time flies
Polydunami
Yes?
Polydunami, the couch doesn't either.
I hate this key board
I spelt your name wrong
Oh boy, have I made a meme by accident?
/me looks at clock
correcting myself
Oh really? I didn't notice
5:00 AM :O
11:00AM
Ponies47 6:02AM! :O
Polydunami, it wasn't even there to begin with. o__o
I watched some Doctor Who today.
I experienced the Sensorites for the first time.
/me didn't watch any Dr. Who today
Ninjazz, I can't wait till I get to the first Cybermen serial
Sat on a train and talked to you folks today.
/me watched the stream, talked, enjoyed the company
Poor wall.
Polydunami, is that the one with the meme everyone getting on about? EXTERMINATE?
I don't know anything. >__<
DELETE
Ninjazz: mfw Dr Whooves is "canon" :O
your system 32 folder.
Doctor Whooves is thrid best pony
MadSurge, we'll see. We'll see.
hello bronystate
Please don't try to delete you system 32 though
lift ALL the vents!
Hello there, SirGanjalf.
Hey SirGanjalf
Ninjazz: being at least acknowledged by the toys it's really something, together with Octavia and Vynil :D
Polydunami, does it exterminate?
Sometimes
MadSurge, Hasbro is giving a listening ear to the fandom. Good, I guess.
Lovely.
Ok I really should hit the hay. Night ya'll :)
Ninjazz: is there something wrong? :O
Gnight, Ponies47. Take care.
Night night Ponies47 don't let the anti-durians bite
MadSurge, nope. Just too tired to give a proper happy responce. :D
Ninjazz: aww :D
/me casts untired on Ninjazz
So yeah night wubs and all that other (squee) :P
It's!... uneffective. ;~;
Ciao
:(
Night, Ponies47.
Ninjazz: I wish for another Derpy cameo :D
Hey Ninjazz, you can look up the classic Doctor Who serials online.
I'm a failure of a mage.
/me runs off crying.
Polydunami, that's something I plan on doing. Just to lazy to get started. :D
That's how I first started watching a week ago.
MadSurge, I think... it's best we leave that where it died off.
a cord stopped it?
Ninjazz: aye D:
Also, some of the episodes are missing. I've taken to reading the transcripts of those instead.
As in, lost.
Never to be found again?
Well, we hope that's not the case.
he just took that like a boss
Geeze, some of my friends are into Doctor Who. I feel like I'm becoming... a Doctor Who fan.
hello everypony
Hey yifle1!
I'm sure it's not all that bad, Polydunami.
Hello there, yifle1.
Hey yifle1
Hey, I never said it was a BAD thing
do anypony know a good 8-bit program
Nope.
Nope, sorry, yifle1.
its okay
Polydunami, is it a good thing?
i want to make mlp music
Well, maybe "fan" is pushing it too hard.
I don't really consider myself a fan of anything to be honest.
Really?
see everypony later
Like you're open to just about everthing kind of thing.
Bye bye yifle1
Cya, yifle1. Take care.
Well, there are certain shows which I like.
Doesn't mean I'm a diehard fan.
You know what I mean
Forever alone face.
08,01meh
08,01i'm kinda bummed out
08,01the lass i was trying to contact hasn't replied
08,01so it's getting more and more likely that she's ignoring me
Or not.
08,01so i has a :(
:(
08,01Biglaw: aye
http://fav.me/d561nr2 nice shot by moi
I hate it when that happens ;~;
08,01EggWhite|DurianTrade: i... did something
I never developed a crush on anyone since.
08,01that means i wouldn't be surprised if they wanted to ignore me
08,01she was hitting on me at LAC
08,01and i... kinda pulled a guy in front of her
Oh my
08,01als, Biglaw, that's a wonderful pic <3
Wow, a poster of John Lennon has the perfect quote for the picture
Dang navit!

Good afternoon everypony :)
08,01Polydunami: i don't eve know if i'm just being paranoid about this, or she was actually offended by it, to be honest
08,01i mean
08,01we were kinda hitting it off
08,01and maybe quite well
Afternoon killerpony7733.
08,01but nothing was said either way about it
08,01so meh
08,01i dunno
08,01maybe she was just pissed off with the party
Hi everypony!
Heyp.
Hi MultiStar101!
08,01i just don't know what to do!
08,01she was lovely and i really want her as a friend!
08,01she was really awesome!
08,01and i don't like the idea of her just... ignoring me forever
Well, I'm not much of an expert on this kind of an issue.
Oh hai MultiStar101
08,01>friendliest fandom ever
I think I'm gonna eat something soon
08,01>everyone claims to suck at socialising
See, I once had a crush on a girl and she sent me a facebook rejection.
I don't socialise, I entertain.
Polydunami ouch...
08,01Polydunami: a rejection would be fine! just not ignoring...
I do, most people can only get 2 words out of me.
Sometimes 3
We were good friends beforehand too.
08,01i made up a dirty song about 2 members of the BUCK committee last night
08,01Kammerjunk: how do i go about it, though? "i'm sorry if i caused you offence by kissing a guy in front of you; if i totally misinterpreted that and you don't care two shits that i did it, ignore this"
08,01EggWhite|DurianTrade: Brony UK Convention
It's okay, Biglaw: we worked things out.
08,01i'll give it a few more days
08,01maybe she just hasn't seen my message
Alright, time to eat
brb
08,01but... what is this? i mean, am i just worried, or am i actually crushing on her?
Oh ok wait there is a convention here, I was not informed.
08,01because ... honestly, i don't want to be, really
08,01no time for anything like that
08,01i crush on people to easily
08,01it's like it's just an inevitable stage of frienship i go through with everyone i know
08,01male, female, gay, straight
I know how you feel about being ignored, but having a crush on someone, me no know.
What about pansexual?
...Or asexual.
08,01Kammerjunk: ohai mark, how's your sex life?
Or polysexual.
Say what?
Or better yet Xsexual.
08,01i'm pan sexual
08,01i like crockery
04Pan sexual, eh? So that means you like personalities
Did somepony say polysexual?
Me
08,01was... that an anti-joke, Ghosties?
>.>
04Dead serious
Pansexuality for the win!
08,01oh goddamnit, why do i keep spilling things on myself?
04Because you were laughing at me :P
/me puts up hand "high five anyone?"
08,01Ghosties: sorry, yes, that's what i mean. i like personalities; gender and sexuality largely aren't a factor to me.
/me 08,01hi 5's EggWhite|DurianTrade
Let's see, having read yaoi manga... Nope. Polydunami is heterosexual.
Mostly
Yay!
00,02Boo Ya
08,01Polydunami: that's hardly a conclusive test!
00,02take that game
04Ohai Phase
Corroba-what
08,01whoops
08,01Polydunami: we need some external corroboration
hi everyone
08,01Polydunami: in whcih case, this is very relevant: http://ompldr.org/vZW1xdA
Whats corroboration?
I really don't understand
Hey Lil_B
Gee, I can't be smart at everything, can I?
pansexual you say? :3c
08,01EggWhite|DurianTrade: being validated by more than one party
tnaks EggWhite|DurianTrade :)
08,01Rain: pansexual brohoof?
thanks*
 /)
08,01(\
08,01hehehe
^_^
08,01i love the brohoof emoticon
08,01it's just genius
ikr?
08,01i giggled so hard the first time i saw it
XD
08,01this coffee is the worst
08,01i'm only drinking coffee because i've run out of tea
I always thankt that it should look more like / ] but /) looks better
Well, I enjoyed that breakfast
08,01but this coffee is terrible, even for coffee
Tea > Coffee
I like Omnisexual best.
Omni is best prefix.
ponies>coffee
Egg<Durian
08,01EggWhite|DurianTrade: pan is greek, omni is latin
08,01they both mean "all"
Misa knows :)
08,01ah, okay
08,01i used to have a social circle of lots of Andrews
I like using Omnisexual rather then pansexual but pansexual is more commonly used.
08,01Tall Andrew, Small Andrew, Chinese Andrew, Useless Andrew
08,01i was known as Unprefixed Andrew
00,02wait
00,02this room has no entences
00,02except the one i made in the wall
What's Phase4 known as, then?
Phase4: Magic
00,02how did the person get stuff in then
Phase4 it was covered up?
00,02and why is there a valve in there
inb4 damn
08,01wait, yeah, Phase4 is also an Andrew
Too late
00,02Biglaw, the rebar was rusted
I'm a Derrick
00,02yup, i'ma andrew
My brother is an Andrew.
08,01it's funny when we see each others' terminals
I'm special, my name is in the dictionary
08,01when i see his, i think "wait, i'm logged in to *what* machine?"
Phase4, because the goo monster lives in there and he travels through the pipes
08,01Phase4: never call any of your machines Hastur
08,01that'll get confusing
00,02lol
08,01or name them after Gibson AIs
00,02i've still got to name my laptop
I'm known as David in IRL.
But you can call me blarg.
in in real life?
Phase4, call it Phase5
00,02i have 3 machines right now
Double in
00,02laptop and two others
EggWhite, that's a nice name
/me is also known as David IRL :3
00,02ones satelite (cause satelite dish), other is silver cause the case is bare metal
Which one blarg?
my name is Rain irl
My name is just Sebastian however i am called by a nickname mostly :D
08,01andrew@hastur:~$ <--- if i see that on someone else's terminal, i'll start to panic
Polydunami: David highfive!
/)
00,02suddenly praxis
(/
/me forever a Derrick
00,02what to buy....
David /)*(\ David
00,02lol
Or brohoof tis all good.
You can call your computer Mr.Smith , then go find that fanfare from the show and put it as your startup sound. /) to anyone "who" gets that reference.
I call my computer Hal
I need a wake up shower, be back soon
I've stayed up too long
Phase4: Get dermal armor
I think I will head for bed now. Goodnight everypony!
get derpy eyes
00,02killerpony7733, i'm thinking that
00,02but being a stealth build, dont realy need it
Night night Polydunami, anti-durian = bad
00,02cloaking system seems like it'd be more usefull
00,02then again that uses energy
00,02too bad it wont recharge more than one battery
Phase4: don't most things?
00,02EggWhite|DurianTrade, thing says it uses a lot
00,023 seconds to consume one cell
EggWhite|DurianTrade: Cloak is the most energy consuming of abilities
Oh ok wow that is alot.
Hey guys
ahhh, DE:HR
00,02the upgraded ones will do 7 seconds
00,02ohai Chrysalis
how is everyone?
Hey Chrysalis how are you?
00,02for the lulz
I'm good
yeah, but imagine the gap that you just needed a small amount of invisiblity to get passed
leaves you so damn vulnerable
00,02but explosions
but you are stealth
00,02but explosions
Yay explosions
but stealth
00,02^
00,02EggWhite gets it
yeah, hes gonne stealth all the way behind them
the blow em up
Explosive /)
00,02^
lol
Phase = stealth bomber
00,02EggWhite|DurianTrade, (\
Get a rocket launcher and maybe a grenade launcher
00,02dem hacking addons would make hacking laughably easy
you should upgrade your batteries so you dont have to worry about energy consumption so much
:D
Oh and get a chicken.
phase late game they are essential
00,02theres allso the two at once mele thing
that is AMAZING
Phase4: That one is very useful
00,02Rain, thinking about that, but it wont recharge more than one cell
wtf
00,02or will it
00,02i dont know
yeah, no point going for extra cells
00,02it only recharges one of the two now
then upgrade your recharging?
00,02multi-takedown or batteries?
it only ever recharges the first cell available
Phase4: Yeah a good idea
so if you half use te first cell, itll recharge it
Phase4 Explosions!
but it wont if you completely drain it
the recharge speed are useful, but pretty much a waste of time to get the batterys
Do it!
Make things explode
00,02multi-takedown is probably a limited use thing
00,02but the batteries i use a bot
00,02bit'
Phase4 its pretty much everywhere
Explosions
00,02i'd allso like the aim stabilizer
Yeah it helps get rid of all recoil
Remove ALL the recoil!
Fun fact, I always pick stats upgrades instead of flashy moves that do shit damage :D
hmmm
i might cosplay to BUCK as Brittania
should i?
Where is BUCK?
manchester, UK
On sec don't know how far manchester is from cornwall.

Chrysalis: Why not? (you mean Hetalia, right? 6_9

I looked up some Toys R Us locations, Willowbrook & Katy Mills are the closest, but too busy and seldom have anything on the shelves when I go...
Cypresswolf:
looked them up for pony toys?
However, there is one in College Station some 80 miles out - mainly a college town so much more likely to have store exclusives
I gtg now ponies! Bye!

-lol for a second I thought that was a marajana bush or something -lol
Although...I did get weird looks from the cashier - that "Aren't you a little old for this" look -
trash next to food? seems legit
Cypresswolf: :D
food next to trash
08,01indeed
08,01my god, this weekend was great in terms of getting the committee working together
08,01everyone is all hyped up now
Got taste mate?
is everything coming to gether?
Picture this - Big guy in late 20's with a basket FULL of my little pony toy sets & nothing else at a time where most have just clocked out of work - filling up the conveyour belt with ponies - with several Moms & children behind me
Ducks =D
Cypresswolf: seems legit
Yeah, I can understand those looks
Haio, everybrony.
ello CountDoofus
Cypresswolf: -lol well thats one way to test your brony-ness
lol
*raises hoof in Victory* /)
(\
the only way i showed my brony-ness is buy wearing mlp shirts
Phase4: Horeee sheet! >:3 you just punch a wall down :D
by*
00,02that i did
Next week, I'll look for the rest of the vehicles & train car sets
Might even take some out of the box - :O - and ruin the collector's value - :O:O
/me likes his iPhone
Is anyone else tempted to let Derpy Hooves out of her box if they get one?
remote control car for pinkie pie :D

I have never been one for toys, preferring clothing articles and accessories, so what I see in a rare toy is the possibility for monetary gain.
My ability to kill the chat continues to amaze me.
I dont collect for monetary gain - practically everything Ive collected over the years are worth the same if not less than the day I got them - from baseball & comic cards to wrestling figures, and anime figurines
not even the artworks
Cypresswolf: As long as it's a somewhat special item you never throw out, it will eventually become valuable regardless.
i swear his voice reminds me of batman
I never asked for this...I'm BATMAN!
shes wants time in da sack
00,02>leave no wounds
00,02>meens no tranq or stun gun
00,02>punching is k
yup
00,02seems logical
cause bruises and broken bones could be from the fall
but the drug route, not sure how they explain that
00,02ok
00,02plant drugs or throw off building?
hmm..
Phase4: save before you do anything and try both out?
00,02i doubt theres a difference
thers no actual karma system
so its which you want to do
but i think you get more money for drugs
which ever seems eaiser
no tranqa
00,02wonder if i can do both
annoyingly you can't do both
00,02as in i fail or just doesnt count?
doesnt count
youll get the drug one
well, whiever first
00,02ah
00,02i'ma google the rewards
00,02rewards are the same
00,02"Planting the drugs, then dropping Chan off the roof will fail the mission."
00,02but dropping him of a roof
00,02has a chive
00,02oh, thats a bummer
00,02cant get pacifist after doing this
00,02probably failed pacifist anyway
you snapped a neck through wall didnt you
00,02off the roof it is
you failed it a long while ago
00,02right at the begining i had to shoot a few people
00,02ran out of darts
why not beat them
he dead
00,02Chrysalis, wasnt aware of how to do that yet
00,02might play through again
00,02might now
00,02not'
i did enjoy the pacifist run
far more tactical
you can run and gun this far too easy
oh hell be satisfied
lol
there was no point in that
00,02hmmm
00,02not sure what this is for
00,02'dirty job'
00,02take or no take?
take it
take that dirt
00,02k
:P
00,02lol

so has any pony heard any news on the phonix wright games last i heard it was still only in japan never to br brought to the US for the transluating it desrives
im sure fans however who are talented will be able to get it out
you should always fortify them
Quick_Thinker: i think it would be cool if they realeased a new version for any hand-weld console
they did ONLY IN JAPAN :(
Quick_Thinker: Japan...OBJECTION
the fans are protesting to this telling capcom if they bring it over to the US fans will buy those games
Phase4: always fortify the nodes you took over
i buy them for the awesome cases and fun i have figuring out the mystries
00,02GODDAMNITHACK
00,02Dark_Horst, ok...
awww come on phase its no fun to cheat but if you must hten you msut
come on, i did that hack with a controller
Phase4: HAAAAAAAAX
00,02GODDAMNIT
00,02there is no code
(mental note to self never get on this site as soon as getting up and having a coffe you spell quite bad)
00,02have to hack this
this game seems amusing, i think i might get it
Quick_Thinker: indeeed my friend :)
yup
Phase4 you have a couple of nukes, use em to get closer
when in doubt nuke
00,02not enough time to fortify
only $20 for the xbox version
nuke a couple nodes to get closer
i barely remember this game i borrowed it from a friends house and had a blast till i had to return it but then i just popped in SSX and its ALL GOOD :$
Quick_Thinker and Chrysalis :i think that is called the "g-man squad aproach" :found a lock door ? use crowbar,did not work ? shoot it,also did not worck throw a grenade,AGAIN ?!USE THE MOTHRFREAKING ROCKET LAUNCHER!!! *Does nothing to the door* "FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-

Quick_Thinker: oh but there was a cath...THERE IS ANOTHER DOOR ?!! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :)
TELEPORT AGAIN :D
lol
love how the police just sit there listening to a murder confession XD
Quick_Thinker: i think he was in the "Police academy" :)

Quick_Thinker: he found a time machine and went to the future :)
00,02mmm
00,02good
/me wondering where +Phase4 went
00,02food'
Quick_Thinker: sounds legit...for academy standards XD
00,02lol
00,02dat timing
man the way they see chat is quite strange
00,02restarting stream
00,02clear out some of that lag
Phase4: WUUUUT?! you need food ?! i thought you wore an amazing kerbal space gaming machine :'(
00,02that should be better
00,02XD
00,02sergio_scriptor, builds rockets and doesnt afraid of anything
aww now have to refresh and hope i dont get that anti brony add (no joke i had an anti brony ad appear on a Brony site XD)
Quick_Thinker: there are anti brony ads?
yep
never knew that
Quick_Thinker: lol
at least it looked at anti brony
it said if you like ponies then your a fag
what isv the point of that ad?
but then again so did if you like men then your a fag so some one could just cut the ad up and put whatever the hay they want in it
even though i dont think that in any way just saying
Quick_Thinker: dont worry,everyone in here knows that you are kiding :)
just like fox in way they dont do thier research
Quick_Thinker: on of these days The "Hub" will be so powerfull beacuse of mlp that hasbro will buy the fox channels :)
actually an interesting story my mother is a cable news actor and she got the privlage to show off brony con
:o
i actually got to brony con as a PRESS MEMBER
Quick_Thinker: lucky
it was pretty darn useless of a badge XD
Quick_Thinker: why is that?
Quick_Thinker: what advantages did it have ?
it got me in a few things faster then most people the interviews and the signings
Quick_Thinker: i guess that is good enought then :)
but other then that it just said press but hey i got my shirt signed by Tara strong my new fav celeb
the old one was the voice of discord
wish i could go to bronycon :|
its okay theres all kinds of cons in local places
like in my state there is one right after a con called Gen Con
I'd like to go to a bronycon, but too far away. may be years before I go to one
but other than that there are alot of Cons here
I don't think there are any cons in canada :(
yep just not that many brony cons
check the internet you might surprise yourself Big
Good morning everypony, and yes i've slept....

Quick_Thinker: i usted to know that...but i cant remember :'(
Over 9000, I think, Thinker
does Van canto count among them?
why did used to know that? :S
just through some boxes over the side xD
Throw more stuff around!
over 9000 hmmmm now where have i heard that
*eletric
Ps: Scandinavian Metal also includes our friends Germans. <3
and im a physocolgical freak studying the brain is my game (came up with it on my own nice huh :$)
Quick_Thinker: i just love natural eletricity,like lighting,and such,i think it's interesting
its still playing thats just awesome
oh they're german which some used argue counted as scandinavian...
Quick_Thinker: psychological freak ? then you must loves studying bronies :P
00,02XD
HOLY CRAP!? Did I see a Masterpiece moment in time on Youtubeu!?!?!?
00,02you pay him 5k

JIC*
Found a new german band I haven't heard of. :D Blind Guardian! Love their Valhalla video
seriously brony haters are able to be turned quite easily just have to make sure you have a point you can work with and build it from there
I want what those guys were drinking
on dead one knocked out XD
Quick_Thinker: you should like work with someone and make a "psychology ofbronies and haters" i would love to read that in detail :)
well i could do that but its harder to make a video or book then most think
I heard it! One of the civilians said Nin hao, or whatever the Chinese word for hello is
Quick_Thinker: trust me i know... :|
also its quite hard to get a publisher when the title is Bronys brains VS anti bronies brain
Quick_Thinker: im still writing the script for the first episode of me new internet series "The clopfic reviews" :| and im only half of the script written
Quick_Thinker: you could reales it independet...of course you would need the funds :|
i find it more likely to do a book then a vid i get quite shy in camera as i noticed the few times i make vids or livestream i take them down quite fast
really should go to sleep but im not tired :|
also the reason i study the human brain is to understand what makes a person mean and maybe shatter thier point and try to come up with a way we can live IN HARMONYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Oh noes!!! ImOkayWithThis|Ded is dead!
Quick_Thinker: :) dont worry books are great too :) :) :) you could wait just a few more years when bronies will be realy powerfull :)
i knoe thier great Twilight reminds me much of myself. The wierd thing is me having a mental breakdown like twi in a way made me interested in why i had it and then it spun out of control
00,02wow

00,02i wasnt expecting soo much combat
00,02Quick_Thinker, probably
well phase do what i do in my stealth runs LEG IT OUT OF THERE XD

Hello guys
Allo DarkStar.
welcome to aquard
Hello, DarkStar!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhjk5x54bsE Gotta stop worrying, about the things I can't control~
Hey DarkStar!
Ello DarkStar
why cant people suggjest mlp vids if there r no admins
Because who'd stream them? :P
anyone who can
Who has the power
The mods.
the admins should let people upload vids if there r no vids showing and no admins to upload
Even if they did only a handful of trusted people would be allowed.
good point
This stream...is awesome
The Legend of Buffer.
Part II
yeh now that we see his home page someone can hack him

Buffer Remixed
Buffer Unloaded
Buffering: The final buff
SHOW A VID PLZZZZZ :'(
Meanwhile: Unicorn magic?
Crono_brony: Magical magic.
If no one is around to stream, nothing is streamed. That's how it works.
i know
Meanwhile: :O How interesting!
no stream?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Nope.avi
I have a brony song I sang.... can I link it? It's my first one I ever sang
Lemme get my piano
http://dearderpyadvice.tumblr.com/post/26472660304/strawberry-seas-forever-by-the-seaponies
Its a seapony parody of "Strawberry Seas Forever"
Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo.

In the Grotto

If there's anyone here who hasn't seen Epic Pie Time they need to be flogged.
OMG
ah, scoot
anypony u mean?

MURICA!
YES
Mare-ica
FUCK YEH
Meeeeeeeeeeeh. Mute is my friend.
WE WILL FREE THE SCOODLALOO OUT OF U
twilight_sprinkle: I really do.
Meanwhile: aw im so proud of you, keep it up
BADASS
twilight_sprinkle: Not kidding, I think it's the worst first world country in the world.
Im just drowning in DayZ right now
EPIC SHOW AGAIN
Bosnia and Horsegovina?
^^^^^^^
and serbia
DROP THAT!
too tired for dubstep
Meanwhile: honestly, you need to learn more about other countries
:O
Saddlelaide, Australia
onfg i <3 this
Meanwhile: have you even been to Usa?
New Zebraland
yay
Doo doo dooooo doo doodoododoodoodoo
twilight_sprinkle: No, nor do I want to. Everything I can see about your country paints it in negative light.
what do you guys think of my song
Oh wait twilight_sprinkle have we had this conversation before?
Meanwhile: lol your opinion is hardly worth anything if you hate a country youve never even been to.
yes but we r coming out of it and china and the other places r going into resesion
so were ok now
what about Neighpal?
twilight_sprinkle: That's like saying I'm not allowed to judge artwork because I'm not a painter. And is incredibly stupid.
Meanwhile: yes we have, although ive been curious whether youve been to the country you hate so much. you havent. pf lol
Who's streaming?
Meanwhile: its like judging a painting off other peoples' reviews
Meanwhile: without even seeing it
Casablankflank, Marerocco
but were still in iraq so any country fighting in iraq is sorta ok
Machinaima? Ah...they sucks
money wise
blase men
:O DONKEY KONG
O__O
no pause plz
...ok
Meanwhile: where, on the internet? everyone is loud on the internet
not really only stupid young kids and red necks
Streamer just doesn't know what went wrong...
no mainly at obama
twilight_sprinkle: Reread the part where I said "I know not all of them are that bad" Since apparently you skipped it.
oh i think i did sry
twilight_sprinkle: Im sry but what country are you from?
Meanwhile: thats irrelevant really.
Retrogame Studios is the new Rare <3
Meanwhile: youre generalizing, so am i
DIE
t*world
who's streaming? :2
Is Scootie streaming?
:3
Everypony does
MadSurge: You mean scoot-scootaloo?
yeh none can if u do we got the largest suppply of nukes in the world
Meanwhile: youre opinions are based on false convictions and lack of experience.
russia second
Crono_brony: Yep, it's him :D
yeah its scoots
*your
RD is so jelly
More, yes!
no
u hav a good idea
Meanwhile: yep.
I request the Mortal Kombat one! :D
MadSurge: Wait, but looking at the users, i don't even see that he's online!
twilight_sprinkle: That's just stupid.
Meanwhile: you judge a country without even seeing it firsthand
Meanwhile: i already said why. youre just going around in circles ignoring what i say
im confused
Crono_brony: he might be streaming without entering the chat just to troll us :D
Meanwhile: youre the kind of person who thinks everyone who disagrees with him is stupid and wrong, i already realized that
MadSurge: What a trickster!
^
Meanwhile: whenever you argue with someone you always make it persona, and often use insults. people do that when they lack ways to prove their point
timstr117: if you mean "seriously think so", then yes
Meanwhile: you judge a country without even SEEING it, what would possibly make you think your opinions are worth much?
twilight_sprinkle: You've never met me, what makes you think your opinion is worth anything?
Okay gotta stop crying
:'(
Meanwhile: because im not really interested in judgin you, we're talking about a country here.
Vordox: :O why are you crying?
Vordox, what were/are you crying about?
Meanwhile: and answering a question with a question is another way to avoid using logic
MadSurge: I just imagined a whole flash episode for the final last stand of the alicorns
=P
Imagination flash episode
twilight_sprinkle: And yet you /are/ judging me in the same way I judge the country. By experience you have gathered from non-direct interaction.
wish I could animate
timstr117: yeah, every country has those people
ok disscussion over
Vampire Rain :D
Meanwhile: lol basically right now youre diverging this conversation into blaming me for judging you, which im not.
Vordox: same here, i also can't make music. XD
no u not judeing me
Meanwhile: and even if i Were judging you, that doesnt change anything
r u???/
Meanwhile: that doesnt mean im wrong about what i said
hi everyone
Hey Lil_B!
Crono_brony: The thing is, if I made this into a reality, it would probably one of the most viewed within weeks of most all MP things
yes u arnt wrong
D:
hi Lil_B :)
Haio Lil_B. Grab some popcorn and enjoy the drama.
yay TELSTRA IS BEING A DICK WITH ME FUCKING inTERNET
Meanwhile: honestly, youve never had much contact with slavs obviously. talk with serbs about their country, then youll see what real arrogance and nationalism is like
i swere i want them fired
This game looks cheap :D
Crono_brony: It would be the equilvalent to the ending of S2, just way better. :P
twilight_sprinkle: You're not even talking to me any more, you're more interested in appearing right to everyone else.
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pr7fb/
Didn't Michael from Roosterteeth play this game on Rage Quit sometime?
relevant
DED
LOOK OUT FOR ANT
now im confused so lets just stop
YES :D
Trollestia has affected this conversation. DAMMIT TROLLESTIA!
Two best friends play is awesome
This game is so horrible :D
^
Meanwhile: ok lets stop here and analyze our conversations. by now youve called me:a twonk, you called my opinions stupid, you said im more interested in appearing right. have i insulted you once? No.
"It's not raining men." :D
no
You guys ever see these two LP Silent Hill Downpour
StinkomanFan: I did
nope
twilight_sprinkle: And now you're appealing to the moral high ground because I'm blunt. In addition, you've said my opinion doesn't matter.
hi MadSurge MegaMoonShine and CountDoofus ;) which drama?
I heard this game really sucked.
FORWARD UNTO DAWN
Lil_B: Meanwhile and twilight_sprinkle are bickering
For a game that's suppose to be on this generation, it looks like last gen's graphics.
Ninjazz: What game? i cant see the stream.
ok lets ust go with that
Vampires, er.... nightwalkers will fuck you up
twilight_sprinkle: You're implying that an opinion can be proved, which it can't. That's why it's an opinion and not a fact.
Crono_brony, Vampire Rain... i think.
not bad
Ninjazz: Thanks! ^^
^_^
if u havent been to a place u shouldnt judge it
interface reminds me of metal gear
CountDoofus oh, I see XD
Meanwhile: an opinion can always be proved lol. saying "it cant be proved" makes opinions worthless and is just another way to avoid proof
twilight_sprinkle: Opinions /are/ worthless.
that is a really good point
/me smacks Meanwhile and twilight_sprinkle's heads with a rolled up newspaper "stop it"
IM'A VAMIYAH
Meanwhile: lol then keep them to yourself, no need to throw worthless thoughts around
twilight_sprinkle: You started this debate.
sure
i did
1, 2, 3 horrible game mechanics! A A AAA!
I would like to record such things to give people examples in how to argue/not to argue
i dont mean that sarcasticly
Meanwhile: and you also complain about racism. lol
twilight_sprinkle: And you decided to confront me about it. You could have ignored me.
HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY
^
true but i didnt
Whats on the Stream? I'm currently not on the Site XD
DED
Vampire Rain Lil_B
two bestfriends play more spesificly
Lil_B: Two Best Friends Play Vampire Rain
Meanwhile: well i didnt know you just like to form opinions without bothering to prove them, or even give them any value. thanks for telling me your opinions are wortthless,ill ignore you from now on.
im damnit, an Anime, I must join in an Instant
Stream broke for me
*youre
ok that is ok. bu tu should never ignor another persons probs even if u think that it doesnt matter
Meanwhile: cold is relative, bad example.
a lesson tought by twilight sparkle
Meanwhile: and no, there are facts, and opinions can be proven to be facts
timstr117: I was just going to point that out :).
Meanwhile: scientists had many opinions, some of which were proven to be true
that is true
DEAR PRINCESS CELESTIA, TODAY I LEARNED THAT WE CANNOT HAVE OUR OWN OPINIONS
^
twilight_sprinkle: In my opinion, ice is cold. And since ice /is/ cold, trying to prove otherwise is just silly. That's why it's a fact.
trolol
Meanwhile: what if scientists said: yeah we cant prove it, screw this
twilight_sprinkle: That's a hypothesis, not an opinion.
Opinions on the internet? Why I've never
Meanwhile: again , cold is relative. compared to absolute zero, ice is warm
Everybody's upset.
yes u r correct
OH DEAR GOD ARE YOU TWO STILL AT IT
Flame War!
yes we r
Meanwhile: well whats the point of having an opinion that you dont want to have value, hence be a hypothesis
twilight_sprinkle: You're just trying to twist the words because you have no actual response.
http://memedepot.com/uploads/2000/2397_bpfobu.jpg
We didn't start the flame war.
Peeps were hating on it 'fore I left my comment.
GOD DAMNIT STREAM, GET TO WORKING
no PIE WAR i got rainbow dash and apple jack :P
Meanwhile: omfg youre the one who started this bullshit about words "thats not an opinion, its a hypothesis"!
I WANNA SEE NICHOLAS CAGE BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF SOLID SNAKE
Everything was calm and peaceful this morning! Why can it not stay that way?
none use flame as a weapon in mlp
Meanwhile, twilight_sprinkle: Okay, seriously? I just woke up and somehow I can hear your voices in my head even though I've never heard them before.
Now we've moved to symantics. That's a great sign for any debate!
exsept 4 dragons
Hey.
Meanwhile: things are a lot more simple, if you have an opinion, that can be potentially insulting to others, prove your opinions and give them value, otherwise its just selfish insults
We are having some Bronies arguing, time to put them into the hugroom! FOREVER!
twilight_sprinkle: A hypothesis is the predicted outcome of study and experiment, and doesn't always end the way you might believe. An opinion is literally nothing more than personal feelings based on life experience and holds no ground in actual truth.
Haio Ethereal */me hands you a bucket of popcorn*
Well, stream is down, so this is very appropriate: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF44JBEC7Ps
/me eats some of the popcorn
ok lets just stop its getting old
Meanwhile: an opinion is a thought, not feelings.
Thanks CountDoofus
hey guys
twilight_sprinkle: dedicated flaming XD
hi alexxm
hai alexxm
Meanwhile: but read my previous comment, im tired of this word definition bullshit
twilight_sprinkle: Thought based on experience.
Hey alexxm!
Kammerjunk: OMG I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING
hey Lil_B Jim and MadSurge how have you guys been
Crono_brony: Fitting, innit?
Meanwhile: you have ALMOST NO experience
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm1jxC-xtyY
alexxm: O hai
Meanwhile: thats what i was saying, you LACK experience to prove this
Haio alexxm
Lil_B: I'll get the good ending next time I play Lollipop Chainsaw :D
Kammerjunk: This morning in a nutshell.
CountDoofus: OMG excellent !
twilight_sprinkle: yoou just ignored everything you saidyourself, and said something that is a random guess. Please stop this...
You're welcome.
I'm SO going to BroNYCon next year. I don't care if I have to sell a kidney.
hey |Discord| and CountDoofus how have you been
alexxm so far so good, worked on a little bit on an Orchestra version of "Art of the Dress" and finished a little Tune I made
08,01what?
Eagle3302: its not a guess,he told me he hasnt been to the country even
its getting confuseing so in gunna stop messageing about it
good to hear Lil_B
twilight_sprinkle: From what I have heard and seen and learned, I dislike the country, just because I haven't been to it doesn't render me automatically wrong.
08,01who is instigating it?
Oh, hey alexxm! I didn't see you come in.
Meanwhile and twilight_sprinkle.
Meanwhile: like i said, dont hate on a country publicly if you havent even been there
MadSurge the endings aren't really that diverse in LC :/ I mean the only difference is that mom is a Zombie or not at the end, in 2 Comic Strips :/
Meanwhile: emphasize on *publicly*
08,01hey now
08,01look
08,01this chatroom exists for a reason
08,01to chat about stuff on the stream, and be civil and friendly to one another
08,01if you want to argue, take it elsewhere
08,01this is not the place
08,01yes, this may seem hugboxy, but really, this is not the place for insults or flame wars.
08,01end of line.
And for but a brief moment, the entirety of BronyState held its breath.
Where was Gondor when end of line.
I hate this shadeof yellow -_-
/me checks the end of the line
I love that shade of yellow
Eyup. It's the end.
Yellow is best pony
well its easy to read
thats a shade? looks like simple yellow
true
I like bright yellow :)
Every colour is a shade.
And all was well in the land of Equestria.
bright yellow ftw
agree bright yellow
I just like bright-ass colors
I like yellow. It's noticable on a black background.
^
that's dandellion yellow
so is aany other bright colour
Bright yellow, lemon yellow, autumn yellow...etc.
...Green?
green is good
http://www.geekinheels.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/how_men_and_women_see_colors.jpg
08,01i'd like to point out that everyone will see the yellow as a different shade, depending on what client/os/terminal you're using
00,10inb4 color flamewar
Also whoever was streaming killed it :/
Chocobo yellow...
Red is best colour.
Hey Sumica :D
Haio Sumica
Allo Sumica.
Morning, Sumica
Deep Blue
Ocean Blue
/me AttackWithHugs
08,01also, that yellow is probably my least favourite colour
XD
well it stands out
Pink is best color. Because Pinkie Pie.
^
00,10at leaset it's not green. Greeen is not a creative color.
you ment Purple right?
CountDoofus: Pink is best color because it's pink.
My fav color is purple, but Pinkie is still best pony
wut?
so the newsletter still acting up?
Hey AttackWithHugs!
purple is cool
Though I have started getting other colors in my closet lately....
Like to wear purple clothes
Morning, MadSurge
What time is it in the US, btw?
CountDoofus: for me it is 11
CountDoofus: Which part cause there's different timezones in the US
FFFFFFFFFFFFF
CountDoofus: 11:38am for me
I FORGOT WHERE I PUL MLP ONLINE
StinkomanFan: Your download folder?
its 16:38 here
AND
What do you MEAN, MLP Online?
I don't have any of the patches :'(
Eagle3302: you british?
Wherever WeLoveFine headquarters is located. They're gonna offer a 25% discount starting from 12PM til 6PM.
Eagle3302: /) For Britishness.
The only online MLP game I know is in progress is Tales of Equestria or whatever it's called.
Wasn't MLP Online cancelled, anyway?
Kammerjunk, the beta was released yesterday
oh
(\ I am Polish and live in UK
00,10Kammerjunk, a beta for it came out yesterday. altho the online part should be in quotes
StinkomanFan, just go to program files and search/ or program files86/ or whatever, if it dont work dont tell me, if it work tell me.
Eagle3302: Close enough.jpg
XD
I just remember some guy working on it being on BronyState and saying that some bad stuff happened.
00,10yeah the team fell apart and the game split in to two games.
Kammerjunk i think i remember that as well
bronystate? Bad stuff? wut?
/me sits on Sumica
00,10oi, I am not a sofa
>MLP Online beta
"Finally, the moment has arrived"
I know how you feel Ford
>Only has singleplayer
Irish_Pony: Salute!
??
>Feels bad pony.
I swear they are remaking it
Bronysith, do you have some fixation on sitting on people?'
/me salutes Everlasting_Joy
00,10MLP "online"
under a different name
Sumica: look what i foun,,,noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
MLP offline
Eagle3302: Yeah, Legends of Equestria.
Sumica: call my therapist
It looks neat.
AttackWithHugs inb4 he sits on you now.
They're working on it Sumica
Thats it! :)
Eagle3302: It's in "pre-alpha", though.
Barbetos|AtWork: I'll kick him to Venus.
Not even the moon.
Kammerjunk: Last I heard, they moved on to beta.
No luna for you Bronysith
oh
/me sits on Barbetos|AtWork
Someone here wanted a MLP online game?
00,10I just dont see an indi group able to support an online server. Best I see is small local hosted shards of 6 players
Barbetos|AtWork: Forget the moon, I'ma kick him somewhere that has sulfuric acid.
Kammerjunk: It looks interesting...
AttackWithHugs: speaking of which, does Equestria think about other planets/aliens? :D
Sumica: I agree. And there's no way Hasbro would let them gain enough money off the game to support itself.
00,10only in the HiE fics MadSurge
Good morning everypony, or hello if it isn't the morning for you~
hai FlareChaser
MadSurge: You know.....I don't know. They might be afraid at first because they've never seen anything from another planet before. But on the other hand, it depends on what the aliens' intentions are.
Morning FlareChaser.
Haio FlareChaser
Morning, FlareChaser .
You all want an online....hur hur hur....
no stream?
Oh wait, college stuff...DAMNIT
eenope
http://youtu.be/LZOXxtXFIOc
I mean, it'd be awesome if Hasbro let the MLP Online team charge money for it to support their servers, but I doubt that'd happen.
AttackWithHugs: maybe all aliens are ponies :D
00,10Sorry cant stream atm, still Shuffeling files for friday.
Ah yes, I have such good friends here~
MadSurge: Maybe, maybe not. I guess it'll depend which planet they came from.
/me sits ontop of FlareChaser
But yeah, it could work if it wasn't an MMORPG. If you could team up like in Diablo 2 or something.
AttackWithHugs: or it turns out that ponies are aliens and Earth is just around the corner :D
inb4 everyday I'm shufflin
Wait, MLP:Online is out?!
FlareChaser: Beta is.
everyday iam hurr durr
MadSurge: What a world!
/me rushes to MLP:Online
Nyah! D:
MadSurge: Humans in Equestria? The madness! Lyra would be thrilled, though.
/me sits inside of FlareChaser
AttackWithHugs: ikr
FlareChaser: You'd be better off finding the EQD article for it. People overloaded their dropbox.
Hai everypony
Allo Ish.
FlareChaser, we love you too.
Bronysith: how...how is that possible...

Ninjazz: :O
And hey there, CrazyCherry.
Meanwhile: Wel I just got outta the shower so I totally have an excuse.
:p
Hi, CrazyCherry
Encountered a Final Fantasy-like fight in MLP Online. Did not expect.
Nice :P
Also, /glomp VioletVanilla
CountDoofus: :D
CriticKitten: Fair enough, you're excused.
Ah, MLP Online. That game cheated me something fierce.
Ohai VioletVanilla! :$
06c:
06MadSurge~
CrazyCherry: they tell me I missed out on seeing you come back...but now you're here! :) Where've you been?
Sylandest: Sorry... My mom has me on my toes. She says I have a Compyuter free month, that we agreed on, which we never agreed on...
Threw me in a fight against five parasprites and a cave bat (who apparently had decided to take up residence in a sunny field during the day time) who liked to wander over and take a chomp out of my pony's health bars.
CrazyCherry: ooooh....that bites. Did you find a way around it?
I had to run after AJ went down. :(
CrazyCherry rel
alexxm: I'm good.
WEird...why did POnychat crash?
CriticKitten: Zubat. Nopony is safe.
i don't think so Vordox
it did
The server didn't respond
Bronysith: I'm good, bro.
CrazyCherry: that is good
/me hugs CrazyCherry
/me uses magic to turn CrazyCherry into a cherry slushie
Meanwhile: He was like Zubat on steroids man. The paraspites dealt, like, ten damage per turn at most. Cave bat? Twenty damage per attack round. So between him and the sprites I was taking something like 40-50 damage per turn. >_>
Sylandest: Right now, she's not home, so I'm here.
And MLPO crashed. Awww :(
/me hugs CrazyCherry "Well, we're happy to have you back :)"
So I was like "lol no" and ran
/me hugs Bronysith before turning into a slushie.
CriticKitten: Ouch. :s crackhead Zubat.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s135yiBA0A
/me gives Meanwhile a CrazyCherry slushie
HOW MUCH PINKIE PIE Fan are you!? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0i-wtiZmso
Zubat? ah the memories of throwing my Pokemon Emerald against the wall after too many Zubat encounters~
I was like "how is that fight fair? I'm Lvl 1, man, cut my fillies some slack"
No thanks, I hate cherry.
CrazyCherry did you get rhe newsletter this week?
alexxm: Newsletter is still busted.
thanks Meanwhile
Sylandest: I feel bad though... She yells at me for this and takes this as playing a videogame....
alexxm: In what country do you live in?
CrazyCherry england
CrazyCherry: Nonsense, there's no reason to feel bad! She doesn't understand is all. I'm pretty sure I'm no video game, hehe
alexxm: Then I didn't
KMN
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=akLqFyZ0ceY&NR=1 wut is this? o_o
FlareChaser: you think zubats are bad? Black and White have stupid rock monsters that NEVER die in one hit, so they always get one attack in
Oh god @_@
Zubat without a one hit kill. That's just evil.
Pokemon...
YAY Barbetos Moonstuck
Why you gotta do this? D:
Sylandest: She takes everything I do on here as a videogame I play. Even if I would be doing homework or work on here...
/me buys 999 Max Repels
there.
FlareChaser: their special ability is "survive to one hit kills with 1 hp left
/me eats MadSurge ontop of Meanwhile s moustache
hate it when my chat derps
That's not much of a special ability.
Bronysith: wat.
"Die Less"
only three things are infinite. The universe, human stupidity and Zubats in a dark cave.
MadSurge, what would their cutiemarks look like?
- Abraham Lincon
/me throws Bronysith into a skip full of rusty needles.
Oh oh StinkomanFan You wanna do this the HARD WAY!
/me uses magic to levitate back ontop of Meanwhile s head
No thank you Vordox, I don't swing that way

EXCEPT AN OCTOPUS
fluttershy!
This song rocks.
What Russian song?
A collaborative Kerbal rocket?
this song. 1812 Overture is Russian
AttackWithHugs: 1812 Overture by Piotr Tchaikovsky.
00,10Russa lost the rights to the song when they lost to cold war.
Kammerjunk: Oohh okay
I thought we lost the Cold War
Sumica: Still pretty ironic.
Classic music rocks ^__^
Russia lost the cold war when Rocky kicked that one guy's ass.
Kammerjunk, there is a certain love of classical music in the USA. It's not just this song.
00,10kinda shamefull they lost a war of cold seeing as they all live in it so much
Hey! Boris Beterlov wasn't russian!
No one lost the cold war, M.A.D. doctrine.
He was Pottslovanian
It was part of Operation Paperclip. Right?
I wanna see the youtube comments for this vid.
Get yer damned facts straight
00,10Nah they lost it that's why they have mc donalds over there now. it's part of the terms of the loss.
This opera is so badass it's got cannons in it! CANNONS!
HERE WE GO
StinkomanFan: Was Pottsylvania a communist or socialist nation?
Drop that bass
THIS SONG was on V for VEndetta when he sploded everything

cachi01: same
cachi01: i mean
BaconMane, I say bacon colored.
00,03You are BORN PRO >: D
BaconMane: Strips of bacon for hair. I am seeing it and I think it would be appropriate, since your name IS BaconMane
BaconMane, I say Bacon colored hair
cachi01: the campaign is the same
"Thank god this battle took place on July 4th"
I say both.
Scoot-Scootaloo: so you wont ever be pro?
Indipendence day clip without Will Smith? BOOOO

BaconMane: Bacon coloured, Bacon hair just looks... Bacony ;)

DINKLEBERG
YOU AREHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
Sumica: I tried the browser demo of that game, and....I didn't like its combat, honestly. Which was supposedly the big advertising point of it. :/ I just like GW2's combat much better.
MR PRESIDENT
:D
00,10eh to each there own. I am still just trying it my self.
i have no comment
Is Tera F2P or P2P?
I AM THE PRESIDENT
someone put this guy in super robot wars
THIS
IS
and I'm a chicken lord.
kidzrul434: No, this is Patrick
DESTROY THE GRAND CANYON
rejected
Sumica: Yeah. It just feels awkward to me, but it's probably because I played GW2 first so I'm used to moving and casting at the same time. And TERA refuses to let you do that.
SUCK ON MY MISSILE PAWWWWWWNCH
So it was weird.
:O
who made kamina president
"MISSLE PUNCH"
Sumica: What's the MMO called?
Dat Guile theme
DAMN YOU HANDICAPS
Matt won <3
It's like they tried to hybridize standard MMO combat and action-adventure.
And NO MINECRAFT
^
Kammer: Sumica's talking about TERA.
Oh, are we talking about TERA?
They have more than 20k videos.
I kind of liked TERA.
00,03Ze outtakes
why isn't metal wolf chaos in super robot wars
One of the "big three" MMOs coming out, along with TOR and GW2.
Evenin' everypony :)
Sumica: how is tera so far? i heard the combat is good but otherwise it is average mmo
evening, Major_Frank
CrimsonPhoenix: I kind of liked TERA.
hey Major_Frank hows your day been
Kammerjunk, that's good to know
Hot. alexxm
Bronysith: you can test the game out in a browser, actually.
Really really..
but I doubt you were talking to me
Personally it wasn't my thing.
Hawt
CriticKitten: really? link please cause i cant find it
CrimsonPhoenix: I wasn't, sorry. goddammittabkey
why isn't metal wolf chaos in super robot wars
double tab key
00,10lol dont know still trying to make a charicter
I'd like to suggest streaming Tribes: Ascend. But besides not being allowed to make requests like that at all, the game servers are divided into regions.
tab has nothing to do with it you just went too fast
CrimsonPhoenix: No, it was the tab key!
I'm innocent!
Bronysith: http://tera.enmasse.com/demo
It sure is fun, though.
>MFW Dudly Do Right had an episode about a coming out party
CriticKitten: ty mao
Honestly, I expected more character customization options in TERA.
As for the game itself, it's kinda average overall. Combat honestly doesn't feel that fluid to me and I don't like it.
hmm
And the rest of the game is basically WoW from what I can tell.
Same quest system.
CriticKitten: Sure, but different combat system.
LAUGHTER
Yeah, the combat's supposedly the big draw.
Pat is dying there :D
But....I definitely like GW2's combat better. >_>
It's just more fluid. I like moving and attacking.
I didn't play GW2, so I couldn't tell.

Controls are pretty different. WASD movement, right mouse button controls the camera, and you either left-click skills to use them or use number keys.
(for GW2)
TERA's control scheme is different enough that it took me a while to get acquianted.

Ouch
o,o
why would you give the hulk access to giant robots
alexxm: because stupid awesome :D
DarkStar: Please at least click "Full-size image" first.
ok
MadSurge he causes enough damage as is imagine what he'd do with a mech
But Zecora in socks is neat. I have never seen that before.
alexxm: split Earth :D
But TERA's combat was pretty decent, I'll admit, it's just not my flavor. *shrug*
/me places a chicken on Bronysith
Beautyfull..
ART
I definitely prefer TERA's combat over, say, WoW's. But really, my MMO of choice is EVE Online.
indeed Kammerjunk
the only MMO I really liked was WoW, everything else seems to bore me.
Like I said, probably would've liked TERA's combat better if I hadn't tried GW2 first. But I was so used to the latter that it was so hard to adjust and enjoy it.
>MFW Gilda and SS/DT have the same level of meanness
According to Hasbro
WoW wasn't my thing. Can't convince myself to pay monthly for a game.

Gimme a second I remembered this one really good shoop
Queen Chrysalis is British!? o.o
Ginger but of course
So, what has more more items, RedBubble or Welovefine?
I thought she was Jeremy irons
lol sale hasn't even started and Welovefine's site is already dying. XD
FlareChaser: I assume RedBubble, but I'm not certain. Do you live in the UK?
FlareChaser red bubble has more i think, but we love fine gets money back to hasbro
Bronies are the internet's manual DDOS
AFAIK
Kammerjunk: No, but I have ordered from RedBubble.
FlareChaser: we love fine is much higher quality though :P
So! What's next?
FlareChaser: Alright. Well, as far as I know, the biggest difference is the way RedBubble and WeLoveFine imprint stuff on their T-shirts.
Hi, Good afternoon everyone
Alright, well lets see welovefine barely has any Octavia shirts...
So, who else found it rather silly to see how many other ponies they could meet as fillies?
Let me check RedBubble..
TheHreatAndPowerfullT Hiya! :)
hmmmm
hi guys :)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: hi there
tera is interesting
http://www.redbubble.com/people/calamity/works/8286851-assassins-creed-bronyhood Hell yeah.
Hello everyone
probably sucks because i cant read anything
What was the code for Pony discounts?
RESIDENT EVIL 6 IS AWEEEEEEESOME
Bronysith: What do you think of combat?
StinkomanFan: MLP4TH is what was said earlier I think
WeLoveFine does something (I'm very technical-like, as you can hear) to it so that the motive is seperate from the T-shirt. However, this also means that you should wash it seperately in lukewarm water.
INB4 WLF servers crash.
CriticKitten: well its hard to tell really. i mean definetly more fun than wow combat
As far as I know, RedBubble just puts it straight on the T-shirt.
oh god i can't feel my arms ...
StinkomanFan: confirmed via EQD
Bronysith: Agreed there, but it all felt sort of clunky to me
however the sale starts at 12 Pacific, 25 minutes from now
CriticKitten: definetely not buying it though
FlareChaser: do you know if the ship to mexico?
Like they were halfway towards a good idea but didn't commit
Holla everypony! :)
FlareChaser: i want that shirt
hey GilDash hows your day been
cachi01: Bleh, its not for sale...
/me mad.
alexxm: Same old, same old. :)
Meh. I have 2 Dashie T-shirts, a Luna T-shirt and a Twilight necklace. I don't need any more swag this month.
FlareChaser: FUUUUUUU
