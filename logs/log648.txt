11,02Alright, time for Doom :)
I hate avocadoooooo. T^T
Dat DOOM!
11,02What difficulty? :3
MEGA-VIOLENCE!
Thowse difficulties
*Those
Ultra-Violence*
>_>
05ultraviolence or no violence
Oh gawd now I want to play again.
05p*
Blasphemy.
D:
05Meanwhile I usually make it togetehr with some kinf of karé and pasta of some sort
11,02CRUD ><
05you pick up all tiems that arent health
05you kill all mosnters
05and you find all secterts
You lose score for picking up health? o.o
Now I want play DOOM. I only got it foh the 360 though. I cant go all old school.
05its the cheapest place to buy the WADS
How much?
11,02DArn :<
05SuperBrony64!
Such as?
11,02Having those health packs there hurt me though :/
05i believe in you!
11,02:D
He wears gloves.
11,02:/
Lol
He's a man. Monkies don't pull off the glove look.
D:
Dat moonwalk
11,02Doom 2 came out on the GBA
Constant Shuffle
:D
05and you wouldnt want that
lol
05so go ahead and get a purfect score! :D
No music though, fgsfds
^
>Playing on a controller
Ew, playing Doom with a controller?
Well, this IS an Atari.
I dont think id be good at DOOM, lol
11,02><
Do it with a keyboard, like a real man!
:D
Ded
This is like when I first tried to play Unreal Tournament...
05SuperBrony64: use strafe!
Nostelgia just hit me.
heh
Try turning the safty off.
05you CAN pick up health
05but they arent counted on the items percentage
nemnemnemnem
11,02:D
fun fact: most doom console ports were based after this port
11,02I missed an enemy? D:
Aw
11,02><
11,02But you said no health? :<
11,02Okie, I'll watch you, you wanna stream? :)
05i said health pickups dont coutn to the item pecentage
Dat clickety clackity Doom music.
11,02I did that entire level without any health...do I get bonus points? D:
05not according to the score. you aslo missed 2 secrets
11,02Well...lemme try again ;^;
05sure
11,02secrets*
good night everypony gota go beat the crap outa someone tomorow
05many secrets are revealed ocne you "beat the level and stand next to the end button
05instead of hittign the end button
05re-explore the mnap
11,02Okay :D
11,02So wait, you said I could pickup the items?
11,02health*
05yes
05you NEED
05to pick up everythign you can
05to get the items score
11,02OOOOOO
Moooooooo!
11,02I thought you said to get 100% without grabbing health :<
05heh
05well
05health pickups do not add to the item score
05casue its possible to beat without takign damage
05makes sense right?
You need the armor though man.
11,02yeah...but like that one passage, I think I need to grab the health in order to get by it to grab the other items :/
Supinhere?
05pick up aal times
05dotn hit the button
05then re-explore the level
o.o
11,02:P
11,02:O*
05careful
11,02Awww yeah :D
05toggle run
I went through every single page of them >>
I wants moar ;~;
05wait
05for it to raize
Ugh. Ive got updates. Brb
Unreal tournament?
11,02:D
05now lets see
05did you get the button at the very start of the map?
05where the armor was
11,02No D:
Huzzah :3
Dat wasteful use of ammo.
05hmm
To the side.
05the map is different here
11,02There's a button here?
Side of the stairs.
fun fact: most doom console ports were based after this port
05check sides of stairs
Not up the stairs, on the side.
Wut.
I guess button knew magic.
05hmm
05guess they removed that?
how cute
Probably.
05ok then
05sb if they removed that butotn
05you got them all
most doom console ports were based after this port
11,02I hope it was removed :<
05its ok
05lets check
05your score
It's probably removed.
Well, we'll see.
11,02AWWWW YEAH :D
05stream died on me
Same
05whats the score?
Affirmative.
11,02100% ^_^
05on all 3?
11,02Yeah :D
11,02gimme min, I'll fix stream
05yey
11,02And you can see :3
And it's up. :)
I already believe!
11,02See it? :D
Dem zeros.
Success.
Great success!
Congrats
05JRP: casue coop is for babies in doom
11,02Or Deathmatch :D
Dat music.
11,02Wrek* :)
For some reason, I like hearing it like that.
Ffs, the time when we had to choose which soundcard we had to hear things properly.
Or differently.
/me peace sign
05wait SuperBrony64"!
05LET ME SHOW YOU THE LEVEL ASWELL!
11,02I'll watch :D
Uh oh. Wrek's going to show off now. :P
Thanks for streaming
11,02Btw, here's the Atari Jaguar :3 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Atari_jaguar4.jpg
AVGN said it sucks.
You weren't on an emulator?
11,02AVGN can go suck it :)
I like AVGN when he geeks out and stops making jokes-
I do too.
11,02It became dental imaging equipment :D
Presents something more to appreciate than crude humor.
05ok hit refresh!
Dun did doed it!
11,02Vordox: IKR :O
VR Troopers.
Dat music...
Derpy!
Fisticuffs!
11,02Ewww...PC version looks bad :P
o u
Burn. :D
I can't remember strafing in doom
...
alt arrow?
I think you hold down control to strafe
This is REALLY making me want to play again.
It's been quite a while since I played doom
05oh right theres an ammo pack back up at the spawn
Ooooo.
LAWL
Dat insult.
This is the HL1 engine?
Oh nono
11,02Never trading them in for next to nothing in return and always keeping the boxes...until my parents threw the SNES and N64 boxes away on me ;~;
hl1 was based on quake engine
Is this Ultra violent, cause he's not dying... >.<
11,02I got my Atari Jaguar (with box) from someone with like 20 games (some with boxes), a few Jaguar CD games, 3 controllers and the rare A/V cable for the system for $200 ^-^
11,02Klumzeedragon: Awesome :D
11,02The Jaguar CD breaks easily, not the Jaguar system itself
I'm pretty sure they're not related, because HL1 is in ACTUAL 3d, whereas the Doom engine is faux 3d.
Boo-Yah MothaF***er!!!
11,02I don't have the Jaguar CD add-on unfortunately :<
The feck happened?
Spinal Tap!
I NEVER saw that happen...
Ever
11,02Chainsaw tiem \:3/
There be blood and giblets everywhere.
11,02I wish I had the Jaguar CD addon :<
Is this an updated version?
Cause I never seen the insta kill fist thing
FanFiction Has been approved and is ready to read!
Cause I never seen the insta kill fist thing
I prefer the REAL games
11,02Wrek is pretty cool :3/
No
Would you like a latté?
Did not know you could meat sheild in DOOM.
This isn't Doom, this is Doom + Expansion, Which doesn't exist. ><
Guys my fic is done!
You really do despise mods
No
Come on down! http://www.fimfiction.net/story/49494/Blueblood-Un-jerked
05lets hope the servers are up
Bah humbug.
That's putting it mildly.
AND, of course, for it's Culture
05its brutal doom
05its a mod
otherwise it would not work at all
Oh
yes
05nothing more nothing less
I think--you said that
/me wasn't paying attention
Yeah no clue
Good, then all is fine with the world. :P
Bah humbug.
Like the Wii.
whos streaming
Oh, I thought you didn't do roms.
Gutted.
Gnight, Clumsylizard. Sleep well.
HO SHEET.
Awww, no Planetside?
05beta servers are locked
Servers are down.
05they unlock later tonight
Goddamnit.
Bah, I can't hear over the sound of someones lawn mower. ¬¬
00,02i just tried to sign up for an itunes account without a credit card
OH SHIT QUAKE
I know these maps inside out :D
Waiwatiwatiwatiwati.
00,02its an absurdly complicated process
Quake?
/me opens stream
Quake! =D
[12:30] #bronystate Cannot send to channel - Message blocked due to repeating (+K set)
00,02Vivix, no its not :P
Quake? Only played 2 :O
Quake 2 is best Quake.
Well, it's first time I've seen it- probably just never done it before
But goddamn is Quake amazing.
Never played quake.
05only mod here is the openGL renderer isntead of software renderer
^
Two evil masterminds coming together?
Bah.
Apple is--alright, but a bit crueler
Duuuuuude. If Wrek-no, ANY plays Quake 2 on stream, the world is COMPLETE.
00,02Vivix, no, apple is jerk
00,02they do not care for the customer
00,02iphones are portable itunes stores
11,02Night all :)
00,02._.
Dat Phasereaction.
Well, that's creepy.
But not as creepy as this. http://i.imgur.com/Cv9JU.png
...
11,02What is that?
You sure you playing?
That's an ogre spider.
11,02And THAT's why I covered my hand over the image...
....
LOL.
Dat kick.
thought*
11,02A lot of people don't like spiders ;~;
^
00,02SuperBrony64|Zzz, i have a long list of things that apple products suck but meh
Besides, I got that picture from dari when he posted it in here last night.
ROCKETJUMPING :D
Mods get kicked occationally too
00,02also a much shorter list of why android sucks but thats mostly for technical reasons
hehe
Looks liek Dari has some splainin to do.
Everything has bad parts, and you just choose what's the most important to you
I can't really agree with or use apple products, but that's my perspective
11,02Dari likes insects :<
Spiders aren't insects.
00,02microsoft has been getting less and less evil over time
00,02but only part of it
I mean sure Gates was crazy teenager when they started-
This is an insect. http://i.imgur.com/4xEuq.gif
hehe
00,02Vordox, its called 'windows nt'
I payed my license for W7, and I never payed anything more- ever
Oh come on that's not fair.
00,02Vordox, it went nt->2000->xp->vista->7
to*
How about squid? Is squid alright? http://i.imgur.com/bPd26.png
I think that's either a mixup, or a onetime license or one use license thing
00,02Vordox, 2000 > vista
GASP
It's only a squid.
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma6d5nEjKq1ralkmro5_1280.jpg here's one
Same here-
00,02CrimsonPhoenix, XD
I have no idea why you had to buy it more than once, but I have never had to
When you play CS or CSS?
NO ESCAPE
yes, of course. I only use one disc that we share in the family, and we use our own licenses and keys
....except F
Bunnyhop I think he asked.
Yep.
I don't even own my own disk, only my serial
I use someone elses disk
also best insect http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9zkw35J0W1rybm7oo2_500.jpg
It's been used like--10 times
Weird-
Well I haven't changed computer on my own license yet, only reinstalled
but I've never had that problem. I bought the Home premium license foor.. 200 bucks?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma7kon5hHP1ro1r3fo1_500.jpg
Beautifull moths
Weird-
I hate moths. I haven't forgiven that one that flew into my mouth that one time.
...
but after xp era we bought everything, never had to repay
Weiird-
Should have sued it.
I might have to watch out for that
That's an automatic Liscence to Kill.
nemnemnemnem
I do too, well now that I can afford things I do-
I engaged in mild spastic flailing, but I survived.
Lol.
We bought one disk, and 2 licenses outside of it
/me slightly worried about eventual HDD failure now
No such thing as playing too much Quake.
yeah
Having the gun in the centre of the screen is very odd.
Yeah, it's pretty neat
Oh
It's a longplay then?
mfw.
Hey guys!
05MadSurge: if you mean the 666 armor
05its a powerup
SATAAN
Whos replay is it?
05yeh
(sp)
lol, Invincibility sphere. Pick up. Film negative everywhere!
hehehe
Wrek's a nerd, but he's not this level of nerd.
05ans this is the SDa's speedrunnign communitys try at 100% every level as fast as possible
Man- I haven't played Quake since..probably the 90s-
I still have my disk somewhere.
Crushed twice already
Ooh who's streaming?
Is this Quake?
Well, there you go. You're not supposed to be crushing it.
Cats always think they're starving.
Unless you meant "crashed".
:D
Cats <3
the noise is horrriible
And besides, my english sucks
tl;dr - it dun goofed.
^_^
No doubt more times we can count.
than we*
's not actually playing?*
nah
Just utubin'.
man the FOV is messing with me
Goodbye everypony!
Hehe I like it--kinda wide and even
Quake makes me feel like I'm leaning forward and running
Field of view
but yeah I think I prefer around 75 or 80
yeaah
o.o
... I don't even remember some of these levels.
Well, in UE you REALLY can't go close to the walls
I just keep to regular 90 FOV. That should be standard for most games.
I like it lower-
really? UE has like border around walls and such?
0545?
70 I think
55 I think
05right 55
Whaat?
55
Nice set of answers...
45. 70. 55.
Pick one damnit.
Considering consoles. >_>
05lesser FOV and bigger gun models
05sure you cans ee anythign as the player
Infact, CoD can actually give headaches at just how awkward its FOC is.
FOV*
05JunkerKun: yes
05CODS FOV is disgraceful
I honestly thouht it was higher
because I didn't get sick from playing it-
Me neither, but you can just tell. You don't have ANY peripheral vision.
Both have the FOV locked.
Consoles need it to function.
Play any other games?
Hehe
05good idea
05casue we are fucktards
Lazy fucktards at that.
Killing*
Yeah, hehe
My 2 favourite games :D
They're pretty fun games
05JunkerKun: then they shouldnt even botehr porting
Is it me or did sound get a bit quieter?
Interesting choice in song.
COD is like, it used to be something, but now it's like TF2 in war setting, or hldm in same setting
Ahh Power Rangers, my childhood...
Well, the old ones anyway.
More recent Power Rangers suck.
I didn't say it was a bad song. Just interesting.
I'm listening to Unlistenable- finally on spotify
The album that got Steel pole kicked off their label- despite sounding like it would be a massive hit in alterna world
but sometimes people hate on it for the most bizarre reasons-
True-
Though I've had way friendlier experiencer in cod than Ro2 or BF3, on the servers
Uhh, BF3 community is just as bad in my opinon :/
05games liek cod and BF3 shouldnt even bother with the SP. but they do and theyre disgusting
Kinda, I loved BC2 SP
05and keep the trash away from me
NO IT WAS HORRIBAD
Aah
but yeah, I'm all for more SP, as--MP isn't my preference
Only reason I bought BF3 was my friends, and honestly-
I didn't really enjoy playing it
If I tried to run it on my laptop, it would just explode
I only wanted BF3 because of Jets.
Hehe
I like driving around
but- yeah I didn't really enjoy the multiplayer experience
05was it bf2 that signed with destructible buildings?
05bf3^
bf3 said they would have tons of it, which was kinda nice but it didn't have enough
05and this is prominent in the multiplayer aswell?
no it's only prominent on select maps
05HAH
05love it
"It would ruin the player flow if the entire map was leveled" which I feel..is just augh
I want to level the map! I want to walk around in mud and cinderblocks when the battle is over
let me do it!
Except it's not always tactically wise to level buildings.
Only the vehicular building have destruction.
tactic smactic
in bf3 I never played with a single team that bothered with that-
Doesn't take a team to think tactically.
SPRAY AND PRAY.
Hehe
I like it when it works- but it just didn't happen
Ikr. The other day on TF2, our team had 6 spies out of 10 players.
05the teamwork actually works
05Vivix
Ooh-
Nice
Can't remember the exact details but they were in the hundreds
yeah-
How do the teams in Planetside work?
I kinda like it
Not saying it's bad.
05but theres a point where the code needs ooptimizing
but the sp didn't work at all, in either Armas, like.. AT ALL, and all the cars feel like they were written in 2001- no physics- outdated stuff-
it's--kinda terrible
053 factiosn
05imagine 200 a side
Figured that much out, I'm thinking more of keeping the teams balanced.
05some drive the tank divisions
I think MAG was the closest thing to this. Atleast the closest thing I can compare.
05some use the figther ships
05then there's dropships
Mobile Infantry wooooooot!
05its easier to understand if you see it
05everythign is player controlled
no npc? mmmm I like
05you can have squads
Though, I don't play MMO's, more player controll create for interesting events in mmo worlds
I have returned, and I have foraged eggs and toast. :D
05JunkerKun: easy, its called aim assist
05all consoel games have it
05that are fps
05and YOU CANT DISABLE IT
I think FPS on console is awkward- but I grew up with computers
o.o
I remember HL1 had aim assist
and you could turn it on and off
Also, aim assist.
05build in hackign if you ask me
But I turned that off.
Sometimes, you /can't/ even turn it off.
*dudes
05then if you want to pilot a dropship then go ahead
Tuurok? Oh yeah I remember that.
that and dinosaur hunter-
Turok?
Turok was fun. Never got very far in it though. :P
Hey Everypony! :)
whos streaming?
you can connect mouse and keyboard to ps3 for typing and surfin, but can you use it in games?
$40 :<
Awwww, yeah. Planetside time.
Damn...
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Oh cool
Do shit? There's a place for that. :P
Anyone gonna buy the Guild Wars 2?
05each squad has a squad leader
05most often the dropship pilot
05as i understand GW2 istn about leveling
I think I heard people say GW2 is about PVP with unrelated story snippets pasted in-
SC2! Yay~
Is it strange that I actually play GW2 for the story? o.o
:>
I only heard the description, the stories sounded like I wanted to hear more, but that you weren't told more
I have yet to actually try GW2 PvP.
But hey, I've played with friends =D
O hai :3
I am tempted to rename myself AdamTheDeer or something-
Oh man
I still haven't played that, actually
Guns of Icarus is quite fun.
Terrible disaster?
I just like Deer-

He is just that good.
But how did they know where to look?
Surely the battle field is pretty large
They might have not
well, they have strong evidence that they found it.
Known
They found it by accdient/ found in the search

he was a hunchback!
Wait wait wait.
XD
yus
Didn't he drown in a river?
....?
Pretty much.
Cause, you know Dari, MURIKA.
Oh wait
Lol you ment 2
NVM XD
Yes, they did say that America did pretty fucking good.
Wait
Not anymore. Now we actively seek them out and look like assholes while we do it.
Made things easier.
how Many americans are in here, since most would be adults/ in a farther state then me since its a school day
I am confuzzled...
I R Murican
I think we just wanted to get to Japan.
But had to get rid of the European theatre first.
Definately.
That's how I understood it. We joined in cuz Japan bombed our shtuff and we said "Oh no you Di'n't!"
XD
MFW the tsunami and earthquake in Japand and Americans commented saying "that's for pearl harbour"
......
>_>
...
LOL
Yeah, that's in poor taste
Not cool.
They already MORE than paid for Pearl Harbor with the 2 A-bombs we dropped on them.
But, I have to say that if we could have forseen the future, I don't think we would have dropped the bombs.
You're probably right
To be honest though, America is probably the least tolerant country in the western world.
XD
I live on a territory and I agree.
I don't really understand America's response to Pearl Harbour
Probably on account of that by global standards, America is 12 years old.
._.
And up to 200,000 people died in Japan after they dropped the atomic bombs.
The response doesn't really seem proportional
It's done. Yay~ http://knifeh.deviantart.com/art/Scootaloo-326771443
It doesn't matter the cost, it's the fact that they attacked, Dari.
appearantly, all of those seemed to conveniently forget that japan was nukes in response to pearl harbor
People do things in war that don't make any sense.
Think that's weird? Some people are saying the whole tsunami thing in Japan was "God/Nature's payback for Pearl Harbour."
*nuked
Which is just silly.
That and they destroyed CIVILIAN HOMES AND CITIES. they dropped their bombs on a harbor, killing less people. they bombed a city. DAFUCK AMERICA?
People are just stupid is all. >=/

05that went ratehr well

Seems legit.
i'd say we let russia go first this time
or china
Actually, that doesn't seem like a improbability.
I like random hugs :3
I mean, the world is pretty volitile as it is.
Well, we have won in other years as well
In years before 1936 we won quite a lot

Cuz my cats to come to see us when we come home.
Of course, when you leave the mobile food deployment platform is gone and they are sad. Then they take a nap.

Now if only we could stick bombs to pyros on TF2.
13i usually loaded up a transport, flew over, and as soon as everyone unloaded, went and crashed it into a turret somewhere
Implying there's any other kind.
Okay :3
Still, gluing sticky bombs to a teammate would be neat.
I wouldn't say that's any harsher than sticky bombs already are.

If you can get up close and juggle the sapper well enough you might be able to get the backstab while he's repairing but that's paramount to flipping a coin.
Hi, Good afternoon everyone
Allo T.
you're*
And that's basic.
That's like "Right click to zoom the sniper scope"

Most spies are incredibly stupid.

Razorback is the reason revolvers exist.
ikr
Really, razorback is the most pointless item in existence.
well, not realy. it keeps you safe from noobs
Noobs decloak close enough for you to hear them.
oooohhh
Its Planetside2.
reminds me of battlefield 2142
I have, don't really like it.
unless you are using the fez set wich makes the declock sound weaker
not realy, i sometimes use cloack and dagger with that
cloak*
Eh, I prefer to lurk quietly and wait for the opportune moment.

T: What's wrong with "Hello everyone"
Hello everypony!
I never watched any of the MIB movies. :D
All 3 were good, I thought the last one may have sucked but it didn't.
Agents, from A-Z
/me deneuralyzes myself
That reminds me, I swear the MIB has more agents than there are letters in the alphabet.
I pity whoever got M4.
Jeff is best six foot worm
Pfft, run over by hovertank.
He lives in the subways which makes him boss.
Not the most dignified of deaths.
It would be cool to work for them but knowing me...I'd end up neuralyzing myself instead of witnesses by accident
What's wrong with that?
I'd neuralyse random people on the street and have them swap lives.
Sending random strangers to peoples houses under the impression they live there just for the reaction.
Worth it.
Not really, no.
I'd be agent P
Wait, no I woulndn't.....
Agent M123
Yeah Ikr
Hiya~
Or was that the old dude at the beginning of the first one?
?
13canary canary~<3
yes
...
Agent PP
AGent? PP?!?!?!
Nopoe, bad puns would come from that
Clearly, you did it to be an idiot.
yup
I'd like to believe he's not an idiot by choice.
Agent TgaPT
T: They only get one mission a month.
meh
And whoever pisses us off goes missing for a while
Hahahaha
Agent E...for Elfangor!

Yours of course

Best MIB Agent ever is Agent PwnNee
That and I ALWAYS make a point to buy mechanical pencils

Nice going lady.
But think of the QUESTIONS, CK! Also that would involve logic.

Wouldn't there be glass in those wounds?

http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma9p8i1WsB1rywedzo1_400.jpg
Whoopsy :P
She doesnt sound too worried.
"Oh...he's unconscious"

He just crawled through glass and electricity
Seriously, she completely ignored the knees.
He's TOTALLY fine
And she only did one arm
...really?
lol wtfs going on :P
Would be disturbing
NO ONE CAN HELP ME
Translation gtfo
I dunno, she might've thought to take the jacket off ball it up over her hands and use that to get through the glass.
Wait
Okay, I'm back.

She's lying isnt she?

Nonono not the scissors
I'm turning away now.

In a bout of cruelty, the scissors ended up being safety scissors.
Let the torture begin............:S
LETS GET DRUNK!!!
You have.......mail

This...this is dedication.
He loves his son.
This is actually decent acting. Huh.

Too bad it took this long to get there.
that one made me cringe
^
Burned right in the finger stump.
I want to cry now.
... oh
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THIS IS GREAT!!!
*watch
oh thought he was gonna go for the saw
*clowns
I have been playing things like Mortal Kombat since I was 6 and this is really hard to watch
Floorboard PAENCH!
PAWNCH*
Where is his finder?
Not gonna lie, part of my finger feels real odd atm.
00,03wasn't he supposed to bite on a stick?
.....
cant even read that.. or see it
I've seen people get murdered before...but this is much worse.
The violence of Mortal Kombat is military in nature. This violence isn't.
ya
this is civvie violence
This is psychologically painful.
Anakin Skywalker: "Oh wait, wrong movie...SORRY!"
...Poor Ethan
right
made my teeth clench
That looked painful
:D
2,14 and they said scissors
and vid
00,03... I think Val would WANT us to hea him scream
lol
random achievvy
Butcher.
We said saw!
Nice.
but whatever
He should've used the sword from the beginning.
00,03hear*
I saw a lot of scissors.
That woulda been some poetic justice or somethin.
Caramel.....u know.... I could.just give u the location without having.to cut.your goddamn finger.....
It's not painful to watch because of the violence per se. It's painful because of the psychology behind it.
I saw Scissors more.
you din't use disinfectant
Self-mutilation is far more disturbing than violence towards others.
2,14 I merely asked which weapon you wanted
Well, if it wasn't scissors, it would've been the bone saw. It doesn't matter how he severed his finger. The shocking thing is that he actually did.
My pinkie finger is starting to hurt a little
2,14 some are easier than others
my head hurts now
The scissors would probably be more painful than the saw.
The scissors was just freaking cruel.
And stupid.
/me sighs in relief
00,03Alright dudes! I'm off to bed
Aww
o.v.e.r.u.s.i.n.g p.e.r.i.o.d.s?
...
You know, you'd think Ethan would at least call an ambulance.
and he's STILL in pain
And why is she getting involved?
She wants to help.
Oh no, rats!
Bears are scarier
That window is TOO DAMN HIGH!
All that work for, "It's too high..."
Oh shit

Please hurry.

Because idk
Just roll with it

They are best pony or their best pony?
Right, it's they're
;)
you're behind a gate.
Rats have been known to swim into plumbing pipes, and consequently, have ended up in toilets. Some unfortunate souls sit down without checking, and then...well, lets just say they usually need stitches.
yes
That's right.
yes lol
Pretty much.
Um
To Kanda
lol
I see. The cops are after the wrong man.
Oh no.
*WHEEZE*
They are coming

Goodnight CromsonPhoenix

Stop or I'll sho-ah screw it
Phew
Not pictured: getting zapped by electrified tracks.
^
Did they actually touch the tracks?
Oreigami
You didnt PRONOUNCE IT RIGHT!
...Wow, these people are idiots.
YOU DIDNT BRING ANY PIZZA!!!
Doesnt anybody recognize his first son died a while back?
I CANT EAT ANYTHING BUT PIZZA!!!
Why would he try to KILL his second son?
HA
"Get away from me woman!"
But, she can go and buy groceries?
Apperantly.
<-This is why he's a suspect.
Ok then
Oh great.
Split Personality, hoo boy

High four!
00,10hmmmm, did not realise you could shoot down doors
Yeah that'll go over well. "It wasn't me! It was my other personality!"
Have you seen him?
He's already destroyed.
Blake'd kick the crap out of you.
I'm kinda looking this up on GameFAQS. Not giving anything away, but we're at the halfway point now.
HALFWAY^
