BEST
REMIX
EVER
08,01bronies!
YES MASTER
/me 08,01hugs Fazana and TheDerpyShotz
/me is hugged
IM INVOLED!
I require items of nutritional value, brb
lolk
Ugh
why has a drive refucking named it's self to T from K
GOD Damn it
now a shit ton of stuff is broken
Dumori, least you aint for 8 drives renaming themselves, but i feel your pain for the breaking
I'm back
set some noodles cooking ^_^
I remember stuff happening like that
I used to have a FAT drive
but it changed to a bloody NTFS
08,01TheDerpyShotz: i is in lab and has no sounds
?
a lab?
which is better Ren & Stimpy or SOuth Park?
08,01Ren & Stimpy
all the way
Ren and Stimpy, easily
Kawack loads of my disc dr=ves and such are renamed too but they didn;t brake stuff
luckly
I had to resort my programs because my HD type changed for some reason
I have NO idea why
also I've grown 8 V drives
Ren and Stimpy
/me hugs 8TB EHD
ugh some one must have installed more V drives while I was away fro " fucking days
YAY
08,01Fazana: RAID?
Brb, noodles might be done
08,01if so, which level?
TB = terribyte
EHD = external hard drive
terra
Yeah, wasn't sure how to spell
Thank you Vivix
anyway, brb
I had 2tb, but broke hte storage drive-
I think he was wondering if you had it in RAID
08,01Dumori: lolwindows
08,01what are these... drive letters?
the dumb bastard of an OS
08,01trolololo
/me hugs windows
there we go "fixed"
...I think I just got myself the perfect job.
You'll excuse me while I go cheer now.
WHOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Grats'!
Cheers.
08,01yeah, try something like this in windows: mount -t iso9660 -o loop whatever.iso /mnt/cdrom
Whoo go Lasharus ,but what is the job?
Translator.
/me 08,01hugs Lasharus
08,01woohoo! you rock!
Windows isnt too good at anything--serious I figure, but It's the best at music I've used
Pays well, you can decide your own hours, no forced amount of assignments you have to handle.
Yeah I fixed it
Holy Mongoose on a cola mountain
As a language student, that seems to be fairly acceptable for me :P
I also told said V drive program to NOT use that drive letter
Sounds like a good job to me
08,01Vivix: hey now, it's great for somethings. windows is nature's way of telling you that you have more money than sense.
Indeed. So I'm happy.
Hehehe
I'm reading EVERYTHING on their site first though.
Because my main thought just now is "so... what's the catch?"
meh I got this Rig for less than the cost of it's GPU and CPU new
I used linux when I was younger, but I just defaulted to windows a while back
08,01though, y'know, it's fine as a desktop OS
Ah
OS and ram and MB and drives where free
only prebuit I've every brought and most cos it was such a steal
Nice
08,01Fazanaaaaaa
08,01come baaaaack
08,01i want to nerd out about harddrives with yooooou
hehe
x3
I wuse windows out of lazy
I accidentally bought 5400 rpm when I replaced my hdd
08,01i use linux out of lazy, to be honest
I cba to spend an hour every game install
Somehow, I dont think its all that slow
to get them to work
I would use linux if I knew good music software, just to streamline you know
Plus Steam on lniux is wacky at times
but, as of yet I use windows for games and music-
though music computers shouldnt have internet access
I used to run OSX Windows and Linux all on the same rig
I was too lazy this time to bother
hehe
ohai again
Also hackentoshes are harder and hardr to pull off
We used macs in school in studio and recording, but they would always crash the software or break down
hehehe
Even in the studio in the city we borrowed a mac, and it fried two audio cards
when was that?
I mosty used mack for working with iOS
2010-2011
as you need it to compile and sign
I think macs are great if you know how to use them, but a bunch of IBM lovers probably find ways to accidentally crash it
08,01to be honest, i get most my music through spotify, or on CD
08,01and i don't play games
Oh yeah listening to music its cd and spotify
08,01though i do have all 3 major OSes installed, just in case
yeah
I played games alot, but I kinda feel the gamer in me is getting bored with games
08,01(the third is BeOS)
08,01(just kidding, it's MacOS)
Lately I've found way more entertainment through books than in games
Hey, did you try OS/2 way back in the days? My father had it and I always thoughti t looked cool, but dont know anything about it
08,01(now you need to decide which of those two statements is more horrifying)
08,01i did!
08,01i thought it was pretty cool, actually
Didnt it have like voice commands, sort of?
All sorts of new strange things-
08,01i honestly can't remember
I dont remember much about it other than "Looks cool!"
08,01it was trying to be System 7 done properly, i think
Ahh
I miss being a nerd-
after music and gaming I fell so far out of the linux and hardware things, I dont know much about current systems
I'm back
Welcome back Fazana
I still build my own computer when Its time to upgrade but thats not really hard
Welcoma
Mmm... that was nice, yumyum
Since I started racing cars, my knowledge of computers has literally dropped
I derped at something really easy
What kinda races you do?
08,01Fazana!
One sec
08,01noooooo!
Hehehe
08,01D:
http://www.racingmodels.com/ekmps/shops/arendonk1/images/-center-march-ford-701-henri-pescarolo-south-africa-gp-1971-1-43-1181-p.jpg
I race replicas of these
Ahh
Since the real things are really expensive, we made replicas
Yeah
Plus all the safety stuff
My nosecone is tonnes different though
I don't nkow much about cars but, it can be fun to watch
Mine's like a modern f1 car
Ah, coo
Mines a bitch to turn, but it's speed and accelleration is good
so I can outpace most cars on straights
Yeah, it's alot- behind racing that I dont understand, you know techniques
Racing looks easu
But in real, it's really really really difficult
yeah
I got a new gearbox recently, and I still have to pay for it
Its a pricy hobby
Because my old one collasped in a fast corner
I'm still trying to get used to it :c
08,01Fazana: is your external HD RAIDed?
dad needed a new gearbox for his, (Valiant 67) and he had to eh put it together himself cause it was so expensive
I'm not sure
Lemme check
/me wants raid- terrified of loosing stuff
Nope
08,01Fazana: LVM?
Naerp
08,01do you have 4 drives lumped together as one?
Just storage?
08,01or 4 seperate drives?
No, 1 big
08,01and it's 8TB?
Yeah
0,5Hello
Helloo
0,5'Sup?
08,01must be RAIDed

My favourite nerd topic; Transistor vs tube
Hullo LordCelestia
well, it was a few months back
08,01oh, it's probably called a Dynamic Disk in windows
:P
Yeah
only mods are allowed to have colorfull writing?
If I got to have coloured writing, I would have it orang
I'd have pink
just--cause pink is kindof azm

08,01i'd have yellow!
Good morning, Everypony

"It's ring-shaped, it's gift-wrapped, it's basically useless, and it's really expensive," say Valve. "In short, it's the most accurate simulation of an actual Valentine's Day gift ever made available to the public."

09,01here goes
09,01I downloaded this animu because fuck, it has the most ballin' opening I've ever seen
09,01I'm going into this one blind
09,01so
i lol at the fact that i got yelled at by my mom for the laptop being broken, silly IT people it's not broken it simply has some screen issues :D
09,01LET'S GO.
Holy bit, they're serious.
09,01you guys getting signal right?
A hundred dollar ring for TF2 proposals.
yup
One word: darn
you guys have fun with TF2
what if
That reminds me
09,01now I know how I'm going to propose : 3
you had little tournament and someone streamed it?
09,01I kid, I kid
Anyone up for TF2 in a mo?
Fazana: I'm trying to get onto the Legion of Ponies server.
09,01CUE THE EPIC OPENING
NewDCD: Propose to Luna with that.
09,01this opening is what dreams are made of
I don't know any brony servers 3: send me an IP on "Fazana" on steam if you get in
09,01that'd be like proposing to my big sister.
Oh.
That'd be awkward.
what?
dancing fridge?
Fazana: Will do.
09,01dancing fridge is best fridge <3
Nothing wrong with a dancing fridge
welp, this is awkward
I have a bed with feet
at least it isn't a running fridge
I wish I had a Princess Molestia pillow cover.
I think I hit the whiskey a bit too hard last night...*locks bottle away*
why?
I want a RD bedding
But since I'm in a double bed because I like to stretch out, I doubt there's one for double bedding
Im starting to see inanimate object dance on the stream :P
09,01dat Curry
09,01the stream is lagging?
Teehee
I'm getting no lag at all DCD
09,01oh okay
Mini Stargate!
09,01because the inanimate object da-yeah
"Pony verb the noun" may be the best lyrics I have ever heard.
09,01INSTANT WAIFU, JUST ADD WATER.
Does it lead to Equestria?
Hell the ether just be throwing girls at your face these days
Maetstuh
Fazana: Uhh, are you the one with the elephant avatar?

just press the play button
what is it about?
if you have no stream
09,01so Shao is an alternate universe version of Luna?
Who cares what its about with the prospect of dancing furnature
looks like a good series to look for at Anime Matsuri.
well as long as the girl doesn't go all lusty for the guy, I'm game
09,01from what I gather, it's comedy, with no fanservice
Good point actually Dken2021
i really think this is some kind of hentai :S
an anime with no fanserviece....all my anime is fanservice
Trololol
09,01I love her protection tactics
>Your in danger >Smashes you into wall
09,01PUSH HIM AWAY, BREAK THINGS
a Japanense anime without fanservice is like Monty python without the hilarityt
what was that?
Suddenly, mini tank

Morning everypony :)
Good morning TOY_PON3
evenin to you
usually you can use minecraft Patcher to install mods
Wut...
TOY_PON3 - i've found like 3 of those, including a strange a few weeks back
NewDCD you streaming?
oops
We're not all on the same piece of earth, you know?
That guy fell slowly.
Shugogotten is like Ryoko, Washu, & Mihoshi in 1 ^_^
09,01I used to be a high school student like you
09,01then I took a Shugogetten to the knee
MirrorImage: I consider myself lucky to have found even one o.o
i like to fly into the wall with 20000 kph
do you want the fez to go with it?
Spy Cycle is best spy knife
hi TOY_PON3
MirrorImage: if you don't mind
hi derpy_pony
at least get your pants first >.>
welp
i don't have a spare, but i've got plenty of spare metal and weapons to craft one
that isn't weird at all
though i reserve the right to charge reasonably for it <_<
MirrorImage: Ummm at what charge?
what's next
is this a 13 episode series or is there more of it?
4ref - just the metal
well, back to studying cranes for me. be back in a few hours.
4ref?
Why don't you craft yourself a hat, MirrorImage?
that's what i'm intending to do...
what is a .jar file?
things are getting odd
MirrorImage: Do you want something in return for the metal?
09,0122 Eps + OVA
ideally - i'm willing to sit on an I.O.U. though
Well what is it that you want? Maybe I have it.
accept the trade and i'll take a look
Okay
09,01CUE AWESOME OPENING
at least none of them went in the knee area
full metal alchemist, it has nothing to do with alchemy lol
just warning you MirrorImage: I haven't had TF2 for long so I don't have many items
give me a sec to find your inventory then
k
09,01I USED TO BE A MAILMAN
09,01BUT THEN I TOOK A SHUGOGETTEN TO THE KNEE
O U
and then derpy took over?
MirrorImage: If you're willing to I.O.U. don't worry I'm a man of my word. Or in this case Stallion :P
I.O.U.?
I-owe-you - a debt basically
Yup
09,01BRO YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE OPENED THE SECOND INSTANT WAIFU PACKET
either way, i'm eying up dat Liberty Launcher
that and all those Mann Co. crates I would call even
K deal
Strange Liberty or normal Liberty?
normal, but i don't have the resources otherwise to make one of my own
09,01>give you hapiness
09,01BUENO.jpg
09,01LOOK
09,01DANCING FURNITURE

Hullo Wrek
Good day Wrek.
MirrorImage: Thanks for the hat, I don't have the money to buy keys anyways
ohai Wrek
09,01Celestia y u so haughty
/me hopes none of the crates had a Unusual hat
>.>
neither do i, but evidently those #38 crates are of interest to people because of Strange Dead Ringers
k
They started dropping
either way, i'm in the process of looking for a job, so i should have money *eventually*
princess molestia
09,01....Molestia and Luna. Pretty much.
yyep
Even though, who would give $100 on the new TF2 ring?
in a heart beat
09,01SHAO'S SOLUTION TO EVERYTHING: TOTAL ALL OF THE FURNITURE.
i've seen at least 8 of those messages go through Radu
08,01http://i.imgur.com/mBn3s.png
including one not 5 minutes ago while i was trading
Hmm
I wonder if you can actually find the rings.
you can't Kammerjunk
Thought so.
is it weird that the windows xp opening just played in my head?
would you rather I earworm you Pinkie's Parasprite Polka?
fluttershy hasn't wrote a letter hasn't she?
I heard it costs 2 buds+bills
nnop
Dken2021 - no, i don't believe she has
08,01i feel i must post this again: http://i.imgur.com/bjqoZ.png
09,01GET UP TASUKE I JUST BROUGHT THE SUN UP
though Twilight did write one for her back in Season 1
09,01dat feel when you kinda like clingy girls
09,01also Tasuke I'd ask for a gaming PC.
Holy shit when did I get a diamondback?
dude want nothing, is being mean, dafuq?
not too klingy though NewDCD, then they become yandere...
05i have way too many unusual items :|
05or strange
05the orange ones atleast...
Sell them
05for what? sueless hats?
05use*
09,01I wanna get
Wrek: I'll buy..or trade?
Refined metal, perhaps
sueless hats :)
09,01a No.1 Assistant Rifle like the one Wrek has
05i might have a spare one DCD lemme check
/me doesn't mind a useless hat
Well hopefully it aint not ghastly...you know what
08,01http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzewfzegTT1qm2frqo1_500.gif
09,01with that diet, Tasuke's gonna become Batman
05and perhaps if you dont know i used a nametag on a machina to name it #1 assistant, but you maybe knew that already >.>
Wrek: Are you willing to trade?
09,01well I hadn't played TF2 in a long time
09,01but I know that rifle is not one of the ones that was around when I used to play
05stopped playing it when i got hold of S8 and heroes 6 :|
09,01I only have the stock rifle and a Bazaar Bargain
05but a "bronystate" server got my interest back
Stock rifle is kinda good
09,01and I know it's not the rifle with the jarate shooting
09,01I liked the stats on your rifle
this anime is kinda awesome
anyways im out later everypony
09,0130 bucks
Goodbye TOY_PON3
cya toy
chats dead due to anime :/
09,01I'd say something but I dunno what to
09,01this is like Resident Evil 3: Nemesis
never played it
09,01only instead of having a tentacled monstruosity chasing you, you get a hot chick that might or might not be Celestia
05DCD i have a razorback that is strange (orange) if you want ir, cant find anotehr machina though :(
09,01s'okay, I'll try getting it myself
There is a strange razorback?
09,01Holy shit she can make furniture mechas
09,01I'd tap that so hard right now.
what the hell
05i can throw in a strange bushwacka though if you want one
09,01the strangeness doesn't affect the efectiveness of the weapon though right?
09,01Cause I got those
It counts the kills
05it counts kills
05other than that
05jsut the same
welp, there just went his house :\
Wrek am i missing some sort of mechwarrior/commander conversation?
05also anyone looking for a strange L'tranger to trade for anotehr strange?
05but yeah hop in whe nyou feel like it and you can inspect it and if you want it, no problem DCD

Same
this show is tied with mlp for me
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/113/

KwakLad: you are I think, this verson is better if you ask me than the first

/me has no longer got a soul
hiya Morty
hi morty
otakon okay we will see, thanks though like i said its been ages
i used MCPatcher to do it
glomps otakon and yellowquiet
/me dodges said glomp
:O
00,10I dont think MCpatch works with it.
and RD cant have my soul, Luna already has it
okay, brb
00,10I had to manualy install it
list of things to EAT, lol
i tried that
didnt work either
00,10also did you remove the meta folder?
my favorite line in anything ever is coming up

00,10are you useing the 1.1 version of it?

00,10no idea then.
:'(
00,10ARMSTRONG!
I know
ARMSTRON!!!!
woot woot woot
You downloaded the wrong file
armstron sparkle
if they only knew...:(
poor Isaac
There's an old versions section
download the 8.1 one
*sparkle* ARMSTRONG *sparkle*
ok
it's dangerous there for Al
00,10oh you minecraft is't release version
what are we watching?
lol at roys face when water hitted him :D
?
Full Metal Alchemist:Brootherhood OneTrickPony
oh
brotherhood=10x the other shitty anime
I like full metal alchemist
oh we're watching full metal alchemist?
brotherhood, aka the good one
roomate I had used to watch this, he didn't seem the type to like anime, but he seems to like this
lol
and the real one, considering the first one only followed the fantastic plot set up by the author for the first few episodes
FAIL
Lol
Mayor = mass murderer
GRASG
Why does the stream always stop on good bits
mine doesn't
no you fools!
hello
00,10boom headshot
now what?
it's not very effective
this...is actually kinda cool
damn, they revealed the blood rune early in this one
00,10yep
00,10this ep had to hook people
00,10action and back story all in one ep.
eeyup
good intro ep
00,10limit the pading of eps
also, this episode had to be filler. To show that it is a different series from the crappy original
indeed
@ Fazana i got the 0.8v and it still wont work
the whole series is only 64 eps
Have you deleted meta-inf?
the first anime series followed the manga for a while, so they had to start this one differently
that guy just pissed off ed
Do you have modlpader?
which is fairly short
oh you idiot!
i have MCPatcher
00,10blood is also water.
IMO, I loved Brotherhood anime better than the original anime
using his own blood to do alchemy
MCpatcher isn't used
i can figure out moduploader
tgl1992: me too
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/294/
You have to manually do it
gotta love Mustang
can't wait for new episode and manga chapter Fairy Tail :D
run Isaac!
RUN
blood glowing = fuck
nvm\
NOOOOOO
youdead
actually, later on I realize we should have been rooting for Isaac
00,10they dont call him King Bradly for noting.

otakon it didnt for me
it's being intrepreted wrong by the irc
I'm sorry

either that or tons of gold
oh im in browser atm
LunarKing: doesn't work that way
i know
just sayan
omg this show gives me so many orgasms per second
...Nice to know.
sloth
how big is your ops?
not sloth
soon to be sloth
paradise92: The real sloth is in this one
its not her
is this Brotherhood or the original?
yes the real Sloth
brotherhood
Brotherhood
this IS the ORIGINAL
in anime terms, i mean
this is the infinitely better one
not-brotherhood was the original anime
the anime was more OVA than anythign
well the first one was awesome
:(
what does OVA stand for anyway
the plot for the first anime made no sense at all
Stop. Stopping. The. Stream. You. damn. internet
MirrorImage: true, but it wasn't really true to the manga. I honestly find this series better
be back later bye everypony
LunarKing: Original Video Animation really
winry is a sexy bomb :D
thx
think of it as a "What if"
wtf was that bs with rose at the end of the first anime?
paradise92: not yet in this scene, but god her outfits
what if, winry didn't exist
noes!
the whole thing made 0 sense
well ed would be fukd
NO!!!
if Winry never existed yeah Ed would be fucked
the end to this series is the best end of any anime ive seen
and THIS is why Ed is short
yeah
I never drink milk.
but the end to the first one was sad :(
Um.,.. I'm short 3:
also, Pinoko! MAN! she was something back in her heyday
otakon - i'm so tempted to run with that statement literally...
It must be true
00,10the faces in this amuse me.
i want to cross over the gate and start doing alchemy :D
MirrorImage: do eet!
do you have another soul leeching you fazana?
mayeb thats why
Stew with milk in it
Adding pepsi to coke
seriously though
I only have to identities, Human form and Pony form. :3
these kids have GUTS
well
what pony are you fazana?
Turue Gutso!
dat red shift
one of them had guts
oh yh
THATS not ominous
00,10red moon, noting bad can happen.
and this is where it all started to go down the well
I'm a black Pegasus, with broawn mane and tail, with red eyes, that's what my Pony looks like
Sumica: don't forget the fish eye lense on the camera
30% of our DNA is the same as a lettuces lol
but if they never tried this? flasky would have owned the universe
Lawol
they never added milk!
LunarKing: we're 98% similar to Chimps in DNA structure
i screamed to them DON'T DO IT!!
Sumica - there'll be more than just a red moon shortly. the floor will be just as red
:D
too late
no its not rebound
om nom nom nom
00,10the deconstructing phase is much more creepy in this version.
paradise92: being metal has saved them like a billion times though
Sumica: oh hell yeah
THE GATE OF TRUTH!
ZA WORLDO
if you were given 1 wish what would it be?
also
dat eye
To be a pony 24/7
Or have a lifetime supply of cake
otakon: whats your interpretation? Is outline man God?
Morty: I'm not really sure
hello everypony
hiya RainBowJack
hello RainBowJack
Hullo RainBowJack
Haeylo

Sumica - an Ulrich abomination

00,10Nah they are named elrich =p
yeah, that spelling
Dammit, I mised it!
that's what you meant I think
08,01otakon: newest version of Android
Samasa: oh
Sumica - you m issed the pun
damnit TAB FAIL!
Sumica: I see the pun now
im on windows phone
brb guys

00,10problem was i was't using the right speling that this anime uses.
Sumica - ah, so you and me went for the same pun
dat sooloo
whats with the oh mys???
the gay star trek guy
um
it's George Takei
wait
Sad armour is sad
Mustang knows them in this early on?
or meets them early on at least
yep
damn, that is a BSOD if I ever saw one
00,10oh you dont like my ping?
*Facedesk
Damn this stream
omg i read that as somepony and was like O.o
00,10Is any one else geting bad lag or is it just Fazana?
just faz
Hello.
i
its fine for me
sometimes
but i think it is because of the distance
ohai Q-Ictiv
I'm a Brit, I'm pretty sure a few of you are as well, which would mean you would have the same
00,10yep Ed has defenatly suffered a BOSD
i want to eat this kankersore
in my mouth
yuck
6_9
and now he's not
try not to bite
just gnaw
/me noms cake
dat training
thnx sundaysmile :)
that's the one real perk you have from being thrust into the Gate Of Truth
yeah
you get to do alchemy without
a circle
otakon: not true. If you look carefully, you can see the answers to all questions, including ponies
circles, equipment or tatoos
00,10so many honorifics
I could sense a "seems legit" from Ed
Morty: true, but the COST MAN! the COST!
its worth it to know the ages of the man
e 6
yh, but that knowledge would probably cost you everything
ofc Ed doesn't realize he saw it coming
see
lol
owned
Best President.
yh, King is scary
Dear Reader!
Better than Obama
hmmm might be
King is best swordsmen
oh definitely
seriously though
King is best fighter?
why Fuhrer AND President in his title?
besides flasky
no
isn't it a little redundant
damn
!upsidedown
IT IS *sparkle* LUIS ARMSTRONG *sparkle*
o_O
O_o
O_O
o¯o are you feeling upside down today? i am...
;p
He's the President President
Haha
who is better than King at fighting?
ALEX LOUIS ARMSTRONG!
-_- not even close
Morty: Chuck Norris?
Morty: I think Izumi could probably take him
hmmm thats the one person who has a chance
I like the crayon outro
but i think he'd still win
serioulsy though, that intro gives out WAY too much info
Not for me
it almost ruins the damn show
I already knew what Equiv Extange was
what intro?
well I'm not talking about that
this one?
or the rain one?
Morty: no, the little intro before the opening we JUST SAW
the one with the Narrator
oh
seems legit.
eeyup
tis DAMN LEGIT!
i thought the rain one was pretty bad
you saw flasky
I don't think I've seen that one yet
Waz dis
otakon have you not finished this series?
it's Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood
my team fortress is about done ~_~
Morty: I've watched most of it
That's Nipponese I'm hearing
also, NOW this was the first ep in the original show
1st episode of the original
HE'S A WITCH!
BUUUUURN
00,10Smelt the witch.
he's lighter than a duck?
I doubt it
Sumica: O U
lol
dat assumption AGAIN
No, he weighs the same as a duck
poor Ed is gonna have to get someones ass
Heretics.
Cornetto?
Cornello
i hate cornello
I leik cornettos
I want one
i hate his kind
me too, asshole but you'll ALL see why
00,10creepy chirch dude
Rule #1 of Full metal alchemist, never call Ed short.
and is in the same category as bread, apples, and very small rocks.
Sumica: when ISN'T it?
rule #2 REAL MEN SPARKLE!
Smoke and mirrors.
Hi everypony, back from work.
i.e. Sig Curtis and Alex Louis Armstrong

so we've not hit the religious psycho yet?
"lolnope, don't believe in no god"
how blunt
paradise92: shes not Ishvalean in this one
I'm about to in a minute
Quite frankly, Chrome is pissing me off today
midgets have feelings too

she was a Ishvalean in the first series
Sundaysmile: lol

taboo in japanese is "kinky" in their language?
But isn't that what you are trying to do?
I am linguistically challenged
Sundaysmile: did he say hentai? I didn't catch it
I think he said kinky otakon
hmmm
Lol
almost just as bad
otakon did al remembered what he has done with ed when they got their you know what back?
nice minigun
He is Heavy
paradise92: I don't think so, not in the original
00,10dat sword arm
DAMN!
that was... quite a gleeful expression
Ed, YOU SCARY!
dat run was GREAT!
seriouly though
I wonder why they never introduce something like a "Golem" in this
That's what Al is.
though tbh, Al is practically a Golem
how can al talk?
/me crashes into chat
umm disembodied voice
through the seal
and what determines how strong he is? he has no muscles
00,10vibration of the metal
/me places a trampoline under Jim
Sumica: eeyup, and THATS why he sounds like a robot
im guessing hes speaking through the blood seal
/me bounces
he seems to have super strength, but how?
PEELZ
Morty: it's the material he's made of, thick iron and all
Lucky you Jim its not so crowded as yesterday i dont think you landed on anyone this time
much tougher then flesh and bone
Phew
00,10magic duh.
what determines if he can even lift his own body?
Vastly inferior metallurgy is inferior
glowy!
Morty: the armor can hold itself up
They forgot to draw how many fucks Ed gives
Imagination. Problem solved
hahaha leftovers....i love that cause i know what will happen to him :D

seriously, am I the ONLY one who sees Gluttonly as Ziggy?
its purposely ambigious
yummi
00,10I am trying to not see it.
Morty: considering that in this one Homunculi are created by other means
i hate it when the video stops but the audio proceeds ~.~
he really is nongendered
/me nods
A hermophrodite?
no
just no gender
he's like magneton
00,10a unic
since he can shape change and all
or legendaries that arent lati@s
Magneton? You mean like the pokkyman?
but he prefers a young male body
apparently
o.o FMA... AWESOME!
its ambigious
true
00,10brb, I just rememberd i have pizza
/me is jelly
Mmm... Pizza

ScootaChicken: nvm, the moment has passed
Anyone here ever see "Gosick"?
Hmm ok~
05i should study
You know, as much as I like Brotherhood, after rewatching the finale, I have to say that the ending is absolutely exhausting. It's like, 10 episodes long!
05but fallign asleep to FMA sound goooooood
Randomnerd: not me, never heard of it either
im going to marry Princess Luna one day
00,10lol wrek
05really my head is killing me, gona go to bed early
RAWRity: its better than the friggin ending to the original for sure, it's more indepth
call me creeper if you want, but one day i will marry her
way to go Armstrong
otakon original has no ending =w=
i <3 Princess Luna
Starflash: is does too!
It's a good show, otakon. It's a mystery series with horror elements, but it's very playful.
I have finished shopping. I will be making chili tonight. I like chili.
midseries stop =w=
00,10the ending was more of the movie
>_< so much lag...
Randomnerd: is was Gosick, right?
Kencolt yup

Well, you know what they say... There's always room for a Philosopher's Stone.
lol
00,10and much like jello you have to.......er spoilers
to get a philosophers stone is an evil thing... evil thing...
Midnight_Tempest: eeyup it is coming
Oh, that's why he saluted with the wrong hand... he is missing the right one.
Randomnerd: well...duh
oh i know otakon, i watched the original anime and the movie... loved that movie ^_^
ohai rawrity
Someone pointed it out before that he saluted wrong on the train :-/
Midnight_Tempest: ...that fucking movie.
05hey RAWRity, did you see trenchcoat rarity?
hello
Midnight_Tempest: Ihave the movie, gbut I haven't watched it yet
RAWRity: didnt like it eh?
hi derpy_pony
Wrek: already favorited on it and commented!
He could use the right hand-- but he'd be knocking himself out all the time if he did that.
Wrek did you color tcoat Rarity?
OH CRAP MY LAUNDRY!
brb guys
Morty: eeyup, it's up on his DA
coolness
Are they playing harry potter music?
yup, and that train goes to hogwarts :D
also, you know what's up on MY DA page?
now, READ IT. and GIVE ME YOUR OPINIONS.
but im watching anime... cant read... too long
A decent one too
i dont read fanfics
Midnight_Tempest: then set it aside to read later
cupcakes.....'nuff said
the continuity announcer sounds sooo pleased with himself
MasterBrony: this has literally nothing to do with cupcakes.
after that fanfic
i dont read any fanfics EVER
That's like saying you wont watch movie anymore after watching Hostel.
MasterBrony: remember... we dont talk about THAT fanfic here...
agreed
What genre of fiction does this fall under RAWRity?
with what nerves is al twitching?
Sundaysmile: Well, as of now it's just Normal or General fiction, later on the story gets a tad grimdark, but nothing gory or nasty.
/me rolls around in some wool. Me Gusta
/me begins contructing machine to breach 4th wall
she's a keeper
00,10spliting wood with his fist
SPARKLES
And looking good while he does it
Ah Winry, you become so meaningless during the finale.
why are empty coat sleeves so bad ass?
i just suddenly thought of Armstrong as Dragonborn... why?
00,10cause that would be awsome
Rawrity: are you sure you arnt thinking of the first anime?
the idea of Armstrong punching dragons to death is... epic
it's dazzling
Morty: I'm thinking of Brotherhood, most definitely. During the 10 episode finale, she really doesn't have anything to do.
Armstrong Vs. God.
armstrong would win
yeah I suppose that is true
Well, DUUUHH :o
she has wistful window looking
00,10well by then they had a rather large cast
Armstrong vs Pinkie Pie
thats just not fair Fazana... at least give god a chance
thats tough work for a female anime character
00,10it was like freaking ff3
God created this screwed up world, why should I give him a chance?
pinkie pie wins
Sundaysmile: that would be pure chaos and you know it
Sumica: yes, and while that certainly doesn't ruin the finale, it is a bit of a flaw when nearly every other supporting character got some kind of role.
00,10actaly this whole anime reminds me of FF3
Sundaysmile: Armstrong will have heart attack
05i have greek country bread buns sliced in 2 with sliced juicy cow, mozarrella otmatoes and ruccola
wow
Actually, God and Armstrong would become fast friends and Armstrong would be pleased with the quality beer God makes from nothing.
LOL
05with coke
MANLY TEARS
Wrek that sounds amazing
squish
LMAO
SPARKLE!
ACCEPT HIS EMBRACE
too hot?
@Wrek that sounds delicious
/me accepts Armstrong's embrace
Uhhh, I hear sparkles
once we've finished this series, we need to watch the outtakes from the Dub.
Grrrrr my internet is such a pain in the flank , should have never switched
"Grandma says we're having stew for dinner!" "FUCK YEAH!"
damned technophiles
Why Winry, there's Nothing wrong with that...
is this full metal alchmist
i wanna be made of automail... it would be awesome
Gotta say, the tech in this world still confuses me.
Brotherhood.
00,10it's steampunk it dont have to make sence.
does anypony here have a pic of Luna that would look good as a tattoo?
I mean, we have fully autonomous prosthetic limbs, but still drive Model T's?
Derpy is automail
00,10yeah my splash screen
my birthday is coming uo and thats what im tinking about getting
6_9
MasterBrony: If you want a tattoo, you should consider the stylized Luna from the Intro to the pilot.
ed is 15...i feel like ive wasted my life ;___;
Ed is 15?
He sounds like a 10 year old O_e
eeyup.
manly eavesdropping
Morty: To be fair, it's fiction. No one is this big a success at 15.
beiber...
@randomnerd thats a really good idea
00,10MasterBrony use this.
yeah but beiber isn't talented at anything
Beiber is a celebrity, few live past 40.
Morty: think about what you're saying. Do you wanna be Bieber?
oh Edward... why cant you tell that Winry wants you... BAKA!
Beiber's special talent is having a high voice
use what?
no I wanna be a writer ^-^
what is on stream i suppose...
Baka = idiot in Japanese
:3
Morty: then fuckin' write brah.
Likewise Morty
Eeyup.
very good Fazana... you win an internet!
Yat
Yay&
do you have a llink to that pic?
its very hard to make a living writing fiction though
I now have 9 internets :3
but here's just a little tip: Get an education in something other than writing.
i want to save it and print it
Morty, have a dayjob
00,10I dont recall where i got it from.
dawwwwww
00,10Shizuka <3
13sumica~<3
If you write for necessity and not for fun, you'll lose interest quickly
I used to have about 100 internets, but I gave them all to Fluttershy.
Because with rare exception, a degree in english will pay dick.
@sumica can you email the pic to me?
00,10it might have been e361.....
00,10yeah I could
00,10some one linked it to me.
sumica your ping...
00,10waaaaah!
-_-
lol
MasterBrony: Might as well search for images of Luna + Fanart
needs moar homunculus
Needs moar toaster
Sundaysmile: it depends on what you're writing, and the writer themself really. Sometimes being put under pressure can get a writer to really work hard.
I realized that Glacier is really the only option pregnant ladies have for cosplay :-/
dat Gluttony
00,10they could go as Glutony =p
Ow.
lol sumica
wtf iis this?
00,10well r63 Gluttnoy
no... NO!
Yeah... I hate myself for being an under-acheiver.
what is 63?
booom
r63: Genderswapped fanart.
i thought that was 65
Sumica... you have just given me a daymare... GAH!
00,10mission acomplished
no it's 63
Envy is immune to Rule 63 though, as it's not clear WHAT gender they are.
00,10Nani!
A female hargraive......*Cannot unsee*
What about the other Deadly Sins? Is there a Wrath, or Greed?
Rawrity: I have seen fanart where it is clearly a girl or a boy
r63 Mustang... i can see that
Randomnerd: yes. all 7 show up at some point.
isnt everything the reverse of nothing?
Personally, Greed is my favorite Homonculus.
00,10Greed is a badass
what's this show about
i liked Wrath myself
sparkle
my favorite homunculus is probably pride
what the hell is this
I hate them all.
This is ANIME
alexxm: Humanoid creatures called homonculi are trying to destroy humanity, Blond kid and the suit of armor are brothers trying to figure out their plan.
looks weird
That car had an epicface
There's a limit to love and tolerance and the homunculi push it.
It's pretty neat, actually.
Also, kinda sad I wasn't here for the episode with Nina.
00,10many tears were shed RAWRity
Twilight's human form....O_e
lol
00,10more or less
Oh, virtually everyone in this show is nuts. Just so you know.
that's what i thought Fazana
00,10she also has crazy recall
dat photographic memory
00,10will take a bit> 5 days later
what????
no transcribing montage?
with an awesome 80's soundtrack???
mfw I read that as pornographic memory, Midnight_Tempest
:D
00,10haha
how about when this series is over streaming death note
ooo
can i get yalls help figureing omething out?
00,10that's a long time from now alexxm
MasterBrony: sure
00,10it's 64 eps long
ok
yeah, from the look of it, we're not even half way through
are DJ P0n3 and Vinyl scratch the same pony?
MasterBrony: yes
DJ Pon3 is her DJ name.
00,10we are not even one seasion in RAWRity
DJ POn3 is a stage name.
00,10this is ep 7
thank you.....i hear both names and try to find two diff ponies
Sumica: shit, I'd forgotten just how much happens in this series.
inb4 Hermione checked out that book for some light reading
00,10dat head desk
lol al
best headdesk ever
Facehorn
00,10some how I picture Twi doing that sort of headdesk
bacl
Sumica: first spell she ever learned was the one that fixes tables.
oh look, Twilight Sparkles human couterpart
00,10haha
otakon: somepony beat you to that already.
I know
but i just got back
I did
ah, yes, and here's the BEST CHARACTER in the series!
At least that' ONE happy ending in this series
Full Metal Employment Agents
YAY
Hughes is best kidnapper
she was just the one street fighter move
whats the guys name?
Mayes Hughes, good guy
i think...
aka BEST CHARACTER
very devoted father and husband
RAWRity: what about barry ;__;
Hughes is awesome... *remembers what happens later* T___T
well, Barry is NUTSO though
Morty: Barry ain't got NOTHIN on Hughes!
Midnight_Tempest: me too ;_;
00,10IMPOSABROU!
LoLOLOL
Midnight_Tempest: tsk tsk, no spoilers
dun dun DUUUUNNNNN
duuuunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
they found ou the TRUTH
they read the necronomicon
Holy crap.
-50 sanity
also, I find it kinda funny that this show has so many characters that they had to dedicate an entire episode as an epilogue for the ending.
yh
00,10quick what's the 3 words for the Necronomicon?
Klaatu
Klatu, Verata....

00,10we already watched it
aww
i wasnt here

alexxm: alchemy experiment gone wrong
ok
00,10It was early on thought so I think it can be selected again.
Taken, shamelessly, from the original version of "The Day the Earth Stood Still", by the way, Klaayu's final command to Gort.
we need an evil dead marathon
Kencolt: eeyup
lmao
The reason you cannot create a human is because Life is priceless.
00,10dat ffffffff face
Sundaysmile: agreed, Evil Dead 1&2 plus Army of the Dead
TEARS!!!
alexxm: their mother died, and they tried to use alchemy to bring her back. It went tits up, and he had to sacrifice his arm to bring Al's soul back and infuse it into a piece of armor.
or just a bruce campbell night
Poor Armstrong :(
for dat chin
Seriously, Armstrong is a GREAT character
indeed
00,10lab 5 ......
Armstrong has no mouth. he talks by vibrating his moustache
Morty: lol
do we already know what movies are going to be on fri night?
beneath Armstrong's mustache is another Mustache
I wish I had that mustache
00,10it's made of people!
grow one
I CAN'T!
ok

He has a penis.

oh god, four alicorns
the Mary Sue has been doubled
But there are only four.
i never understood what a alicorn was

although Luna and Celestia aren't really that Sue-y
It still doesn't excuse Alicron OCs.
00,10the book is't really canon thought
VUVUZELA: It's a pony with wings and a unicorn horn.
VUVUZELA: it's a horse with a unicorn horn and pegasus wings
so like Celestia
yh exactly
Winry uses WRENCH. It's super effective.
Alicorn OCs just mean you went full retard. Simple as that.
13oh there is someone with the nick vuvuzela...
Right, enough venting.
although alicorn originally just ment a unicorns horn
whats that suppossed to mean ScienceLawnchair?
Shizuka: what now?
:|
0,5Whats that mean Shizu?
y'know, a couple days ago I saw someone with the nick 'rainbrodash'
It made me realise just how much I miss him...
Exactly what it says on the tin, MasterBrony
Oh wait
Not you again.
13was just wondering why we were in a loop of humorous definitions of vuvuzelas
you telling me im stupid?
/me based his name off of Kratos from God of War, figured he'd have to be an Alicorn as they're the closest things to dieties in Equestria
13but we weren't, it was just a ping
hmmm
Shizuka: dat misunderstanding
indeed
13eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
wait i spealk vuvuzela wrong????
13brain, fried
spealt
*
Shut up with the Alicorns already
Cheese and Rice
Stallion_of_War: if you really have to be an Alicorn oc, have your wings or horn chopped off
Cyborg is better Cyborn
No one cares
*borg
VUVUZELA: no, it's just that Shizu is tired and read it wrong.
i care science
i care
but tbh alicorn oc's suck anyway.
fuck it im going back to being moop
so dont trash peoples OC
Well, I going to call it a day and go to bed, Good night everypony. Have fun here.
ponys
Well... Kratos did get power-sapped...
Uhhhhghh....
night Scavemder
I'm really really high temperature
Goodbye everyone, take care :D
00,10dat bromance
bye :O
/me if all in Canterlot will deny me my vengance, then all in Canterlot will fall...
I'll trash whatever I want.
Sumica: literally
00,10indeed
Stallion_of_War: don't listen to the silly fillies you can be alicorn if u want
If you don't like it,then just deal with it.
who cares?
Grow some skin.
/me 's non-Kratos OC war pony is a pegasus
sciencelawnchair is mad cause hes an earth pony, and not a special one either
hey!
I don't even have an OC.
I'm a earth pony, we're plenty special!
lol otakon, read my staement again
00,10dont make me seprate you all
hmmmm
my oc pony is a mary sue and I couldnt be prouder
Earth Ponies are special in that they tend to have the least amount of Mary-sue OCs that can do everything ever and are amazing.
eeyup
im saying hes not a SPECIAL earth pony
oh
not that earth ponies arent special
THAT SPECIAL
why isn't the sound working?
he's Speshul
idoits
im writing a fanfic about what happens when two mary sues are in the same fic
lets CHARGE THE MACHINE GUN NEST HEAD ON!
basically the universe rips
OMG
Why does this war feel so much like the current one in Afgan right now?
Morty: fight to the death!
when worlds collide
Fazana: coincedence
00,10uh.....check your settings moop
I hope so :s
both of them are based off real mary sues from fics i read :)
Sumica okay
Alicorn OCs are stupid. Talking about OCs are stupid. You are all stupid. And now I'm stupid for talking about it.
-_-
leave troll
ScienceLawnchair isn't a troll. He's just testy today
Truth hurts, Morty. Ha ha!
0,5ScienceLawnChair, your opinion is fine and all, but please, keep it to yourself rather than troll.
0,5If not, take your trolling elsewhere.
*talking about OC's IS stupid* trolls have bad grammar
OMG so muce AWESOME http://derpy.me/ZTthW
I guess trolling really is a art
00,10morty stop instangating
Cool edit, bro.
And you lot are raping the English language
MasterBrony: stream, youtube links, allowed, not.
no they are scootachicken
dat Fuhrer
sciencelawnchair, do you want to go to the moon?
just not for big streams
They are considered rude, but not against the rules
and what are you talking about ScootaChicken?
00,10it's considdered impolite though
:)
Fuhrer Bradley > Hitler
Ha! Beat you to it!
Hey...
Can somepony help me out?
Morty: From everything I've heard from mods, youtube links aren't allowed during any sort of stream
Sumica just said
CCCP will rise again!!!
What's up Syndicate?
so did i screw up or not?
Fuhrer President? That's a bit redundant, isn't it?
:D
indeed, I just said it in a more TL;DR way.
Also, what do you need, Syndi-Cakes?
Okay, does anypony know how to prevent Steam from loading as soon as you turn your computer on?
00,10It's Fuhrer President King Bradly.
down with the old regime the left will rise!
@sumica did my link cross the line? did i screw up?
It's in steam settings Syndicate, can't tell you better sorry not at my pc
Okay, I'll attempt to find it.
MasterBrony: As I said, youtube links aren't allowed, doesn't matter what they are.
Steam settings, Syndi-Cakes. Should be somewhere in there.
Masterbrony you didn't even get kicked so im guessing you are fine
well, youtube links aren't allowed during a stream.
Gimme a minute
00,10Like I said it's considdered rude to poste youtube links but it's not a problem unless it's during events.
thats what i was trying to figure out
I'll do it without opening Steam
lol leave by window
00,10as in new eps schuduled events and movies nights
what qualifies as a legit strewam?
ed looks like charlie brown
Why there never any tongues when I need them? -_-
Steam -> Settings -> Interface tab -> Uncheck the box that says start on windows start up. Syndicate.
Yeah, I got it.
:3
why is this hard to understand? Links are rude during stream, not allowed during events
Thank you though.
:D
Good deal, then.
if the legit stream is on weekends, then what do you call the stream during the week?
00,10entertainment
We are so bored we are gonna die stream
^
Au contraire, mon capitan! Heeee's back!
Good afternoon everypony!!
so now im reall confused
:)
Heya RaveBrony!!!
:D
RaveBrony why hello there :)
i cant post youtube links during the week?
00,10so basickly any thing we schudule in advance is when the no link rule is in play
00,10but it's prefered by most to not post them when there is a stream.
so was this sstream scheduled?
ok
If there's a stream online, don't post youtube. It's simple as that.
Sumica So, like BMN and VRR?
00,10yep
ah, danke :)
Omg!! Woot, who is bringing us this Amazing stream??
00,10as well as new eps and any specal events like miazaki week.
Sumica I think
@sumica that clears it up....stream on, no youtube....but when IS youtube alright?
I would say NewDCD, but I'm not sure who is streaming.
MasterBrony: when nothing is streaming
When there. . .isn't a stream.
Yeah
or rather, when 'Loading Buffer: The Movie' is streaming
this conversation is making me stupid
so a person drwing qualifies as a stream?
Yes.
Yesterday there was no stream for like....5+ hours...lol
because let's face it, that movie's been streamed here way too many times
Oh yeah
the new Reverse Bel-air: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzfvfjsg791qezg8qo1_500.png
I was about ready to die yesterday
I mean, the original 'Loading Bar' movies weren't too bad
Image links are ok.
but the spinoffs and prequels have really started to get annoying
Haha
Always ok.
ScootaChicken: but the remakes sucked shit.
Exactly RAWRity, I dunno why they even did them in the first place
ScootaChicken: money money money
the 3D rereleases were a big enough cash grab as it was
now they're just milking it
videolinks are allowed during weekday streams, they are just rude because it implies that what's streaming isnt entertaining
it's funny because the Phantom Menace rerelease bombed.
Oh good.
Did it really?
For the love of- Just don't post links when sometihng is streaming. That is not a hard concept to understand.
i mean, THE VOW made nearly twice as much money at the box office.
and then he was the death
:\
:/
NOOOO!!! HUGHES
Okay everypony, I have a question.
yes?
Say that I am talking about WW2
00,10so sad
And mention the gas chambers and whatnot.

Do you think it is acceptable for someone to look at me and say: "Stop talking about the Jews, I'm a jew. Shut the f#ck up."
Hello ~
And just be an all around flankhole?
Syndicate: no.
Syndicate: willl people hate me if i tell them im an atheist?

They are.
I'm an atheist.

Greetings everypony.

Syndicate: well if you are talking about whole damn race of people negatively it isn't a dick move if someone asks you to stop I'd say if they belong to said group I'd say
Last night I called Superbrony64 a motherbucker and now I'm back to face the music
hiya Everlasting_Joy
StinkomanFan: um...why?
Syndicate: Just tell people to deal with it, and accept other peoples opinions.
StinkomanFan: why would you do that?
does any one know how to go back in time?
Take a deep breath and appriciate life.
SuperBrony64 is so loveable and silly
i said something worse to wrek...he took my innocence ;__;
It was late and I'd waited 3 hours to see a stream
The moment I was going to leave for bed GUESS WHO STARTED STREAMING?

00,10yep
btw, why is this called full metal alchemist? i don't se lots of alchemy here
...imagine that if you dare. Kitty in socks. >.>
inb4 Teacher beats their asses. again.
damnit al...
Dark_Horst: there is tons of alchemy
/me prefers ponies in socks
^?
/me puts on socks "happy now sumica?"
Screw socks, I prefer hats
00,10indeed
*Puts on top hat*
/me levitates in his fez and places it on top of his head.
now what?
bleeeeeh
*bleh*
00,10dat crowd reaction
:D
/me lights LunarKing's fez on fire
What the hell?
WHY!!!
owned
well, that was wizardy
Suddenly, hand out of nowhere
Matt Smith likes fezes, thus fezes are bad
It's very simple
:(
Fezes are awesome!
Says shes soft....dumps them on an island :D
lol
Nothing wrong with Matt Smith
That's harsh
dont kick me dari but i like matt smith. dont hate me
BATTLE ROYALE
there was an actual evil plan with the fez in the big bang 2
Sundaysmile: nah. there's nobody to be Noriko
Khaaaaaaan!
Okay, where is he?
david tennant i bestest doctor

00,10Dari is probably resting, he was up all night
scary thought...
i think matt smith is second
Sundaysmile: nah, Al's more the Shuya type.
dat pic :D
00,10nice catch
he was good too
5th Doctor is Best Doctor
/me cowers in the corner "dont let him find me"
:O
i'm getting the feeling that this shows's "alchemy" is referring to something competely different than what i heard in history class
String-Shredder: you're lucky, at least you don't live in the UK so dari can hunt you down
/me points hoof at String-Shredder
I think Dari actually knows what school I go to ;___;
00,10it's more magic then alchemy
/me picks up String-Shredder
what makes me sad is that i havent seen any doctors except for 9 10 and 11
Didn't 6th doctor also play willy wonka in the original chocolate factory?
Dark_Horst: kinda. In this world, Alchmey is kind of like Magic.
dat face~
dawwwwwwwwww
rape face
yea magic
Bunny.mov
dammit fox!
/me takes him and walks away
quick, kill that fox and her babies!
alchemy, as much as i know is a science of plants and things like that
eat the kits
then why call it alchemy and not.... magic?
you'll hve plenty of meat!
thats just me
eat the baby foxes!
Eat each other.
Dark_Horst: because Alchemy sounds cooler.
Your meat.
meat != fish?
cause it works similarry
i see
Magci is well...magic.
Alchemy requires items
yeah
00,10brotheryly nom
dat MEAT
lol

Pfft, Bear Grylls would have this licked in no time.
i <3 ponies.....
Zombies!

chocolate covered ants
somone draw Bear Gryllz as a pony!
formic acid
basically, they refer to "Alchemy" as reconstituting matter into something else. Like you can buy the raw materials and elements that constitute the human body, and then create a human body.
magic is using your own energy to create things out of thin air or control them at your will
/me sings the circle of life
alchemy uses items
element of piss
dat insight
Is this real life? :3
Dark_Horst it's fudementally different from magic. Magic is just to be able to do whatever you want, alchemy rearanges particles
dem capes
Minecraft IRL
alchemy is a crossform of chemistry and sorcery. which means mainly a lot of morons gassing themselves with lead while trying to fake creation of gold
00,10now they are eating all things
/me brings back String-Shredder and seats him in the chat
lol
hmm
what i've seen so far are flashy circles and hands out of nowhere. i'm not convinced
my stream froze
00,10Just what were you two doing?
10,02O__o
Circle of life folks.
10,02Nothing.
Dark_Horst: it's 6 eps in, you didn't see character development
10,02:>
quit pulling me around SuperBrony64!
00,10lol no it's 12 eps in
/me hugs String-Shredder
damn I lost track it seems

Silly idealists!
O.o
i should go to sleep

nevermind
Dark_Horst: the circles are their form of alchemy. Meanwhile, the Clapping hands thing is actually explained later.

13oh my... new minecraft snapshot just doubled the height limit
brb need to check my laundry
13http://i.imgur.com/RLiZd.png
um what's the point?
you go down, not up in Minecraft from what I know about it
heh, inb4 cities in the sky
um
CAN you build on clouds?
damn it LAG
13nope
13they move through blocks
so it doesn't matter
shizuka
so WHY double the height?
13because tall builds are awesome
13now i can build the Citadel properly
bugger all STUPID DAMN LAG!
Imagine a HUGE tower
do you the MLP mod for minecraft?>
13no..
the low ceiling in minecraft has been a problem many already run into
Shizuka - wait, new build goes to 256 blocks high?
13they're changing level formats
where's the information on this build?
I bought minecraft a couple days ago
the entirity of the extra height is going into the sky as well
13new format has height limit of 256 (terrain gen still works on 128 though) and some 4000 block types possible
my life has died.
shame really
:(
Shizuka - sauce plox?
:'(
Shizuka, jebs adding some of the forge core code into the main game
finally
13http://www.mojang.com/2012/02/15/minecraft-snapshot-12w07a/
13i've heard cubic chunks are still not in though, but from what i can tell air blocks will be compressed out entirely, so 16x16x256 chunks won't be sending that much more data
I guess Izumi doesn't have the GUTS for this sort of thing?
i need to buy the manga *:*
minecraft has oompa loompas now?
They have since 1.8
did i miss much
well, good night
im not looking forward to the next update mod wise, gonna take ages for everyone to catch up
Shizuka dat new save format
night LunarKing
Hopefully, the saves should convert
like when they added compression
just a load of standing time while they ported over
13yeah, the conversion will happen automatically
hoenheim is best hoenheim
imma go play minecraft
brb.
but ping me if you wanna talk :)
13it's not in the official release channel yet, still waiting on 1.2
00,10Technic pack needs to update already.
So glad they made Brotherhood. I think it turns out in every way superior to the original anime.
MasterBrony
yea?
:>
hi :>
Sumica, pretty much all the mods are updated seperately
hi?
whats up?
what's happened so far
why not just put the pack together yourself
its easy enough
i wub woo /)^3^(\
00,10Yes i know but none of them are updating.
i hate the pocket edition of minecraft. you cant craft anything!!!!!!!!!
really, BC/IC/EE are all 1.1
i wub woo too? /)^3^(\
and BC/EE just released major updates as well
back to minecraft
She's mad
00,10ah I must have missed that, havent checked in a bit.
heh, i usually hold back on moving between versions till Modloader, modloaderMP and forge are all over
Meow.
00,10will have to set that up here after work and see if I can get my server running again. Or just have wrek put them on his. Cause you know his server is cooler.
his server is also up now
AGH, tenticles
No pressure or anything.
Teeeeeeesticles..
I was thinking tenticles...........
though if in creative mode without admin, it boots you if you try to spawn in blocks
i love this guy
except if you had them before moving to creative

hey, thats the best I could do in 10 seconds
fair enoguh
I'm not friggin Rainbow Dash
I like Ling's Greed better myself, anyways.
otakon - what were you trying to do?
link him the Veemi stream directly
damn it so much FUCKING LAG
why not link him to the bronystate javascript file?
I don't know how
I have ZERO inkling on where to find it or how to interpret it
00,10this will be the last ep for today.
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=GuruGuruMawaru
neat trick
lol OP
no ponies
KILL IT WITH FIRE
direct link to current stream
Pretty sure I'd lose control of my bowels if somepony did that right in front of me.
how theraputic for him

I'll go back to my fics now.
00,10lawl oki Kammerjunk, have fun
hf Kammerjunk
Will do.
Cya.
Have fun Kammerjunk
i have a theory about greed going full armor
Yes?
i think it uses up stone power, just like healing
hmm maybe
thats the only reason he wouldnt use it all the time
Perhaps...
but if that was the case, wouldn't ANY of the homunculi have that limitation too?
Brohoof!
XD
Morty: why do you bring it up?
i was trying to figure out why he didnt do that vs wrath and thats all i got
seeing him use it reminded me
Morty: bc he can't heal and armor up at the same time
one has to come after the other
and he was cocky for another reason
otakon: why would he need to heal if he used it the whole fight?
Morty: he was COCKY
otakon i think im reffering to a fight you havent seen
he didn't realize what Wrath was is all
its near the end
besides
Heck yeah
and he definately respected his opponent
it's two chemical reactions
well two different chemical reactions
Boot to the bucking HEAD
so one has to take place before the other
Animie crap
LAWWL
i think they cant be used at the same time cause they both take up stone
:o
and that's all for today folks
That was good.
:$
housewifes FTW
But I want more :O
I liked the Brohoof.
I just joined
And that was it
more ! ^^
00,10Sorry guys I have work in an hour
Ultimate brohoof of doom ^^
Morty: still if that's the case ANYTIME a Homunculi uses their ability it would do it
You CANNOT leave us on a cliffhanger!
ok Sumica :(
Sumica: thanks man, that was damn enjoyable
:[
05well that was awesome
Sumica thanks for the stream :)
Ohai Wrek
00,10if the stream is free there will be more.

And now I have another series to watch all of a sudden
but the friggin mail hasn't shown up YET
00,10I work swing shift
how many seasons are there of FMA?
Kewl. Hopefully I won't miss episode 19. :3
Yeep. :D
for being a normal homunculus
Ep 19 is best ep. :D
Morty: all he does is harden his bones and flesh to diamond hardness
Sumica: at what time tomorrow ?
Such. Manlyness.
00,10depends on if I get up early or not
IF ONLY
Epic Battle Fantasy was a show
00,10and if some one beats me to the stream

GUYS.
indeed take care
me?
sweet dreams ^^
GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS
I had a horrible hearts and hooves day
08,01do you like fluttershies?
HEY
So did my friend
um yes
who doesn't?
there no stream?
I like fluttershies
wow
otakon, in greedling vs wrath, wrath had no way to hurt greed if he went full armor
I love them
MY BLINGBAGS THAT I ORDERED JUST CAME IN THE MAIL.
05why am I awake?
but he didnt
thats a nice fluttershy
Wrek: Because you can
Wrek because you love us
im just trying to find an explanation
NOW I'M GOING TO OPEN THEM AND TELL YOU WHAT I GOT.
05so if there's no stream i can sketch a little
I'm drawing manga! Practicing anyway... not that good.
05if wanted that is
1st: Pinkie Pie recolor called Flower Wishes
08,01why is fluttershy so appealing?
Wrek your drawing is always appreciated i think.
Morty: true, but he didn't bc he has COCKY and he underestimated his opponent. He might be able to go full armor and such, but he has to heal his wounds first to do it. And HEALING however takes up stone power.
2nd: CRYSTAL Pinkie Pie!
05well you need to tell me if you want me to sketch for an hour or so
08,01PartyCannon: but what gives her that *squee* factor?
Love that sqee sound effect.
otakon: go watch the fight and tell me he was cocky
hi
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=s2CXE9tDxHs#t=31s
08,01and why is that appealing to so many people?
Wrek i want it :p
I used to love fluttershy
Wrek!! Draw! Now!!
00,10Do it wrek.
plz :$
besides, ling was in control
but after that I simply ADORE HER
Morty are we talking first fight or Ling Greed?
/me 08,01feels that there's a sociology essay in here somewhere
3rd and Final: RAINBOW DASH!
Draw! Draw Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw!
...if only I'd gotten a Rarity. :(
greedling vs wrath near the finale
...
Morty: human bodies work a little less effectively then a Homunculus body that's why. He COULDN'T go full armor from what I know of the process of what happened
still no luna gear, and still no cheap UK shipping
Meh.
08,01hot damn, we're still watching FMA?
RAWRity where did you get the blind bags? and how much?
Yeah
05we were
otakon: he went full armor right after the fight
They really need to do some UK shirts
RaveBrony: Amazon for 3 bucks a pop. But...now the price has jumped up on em to like 8 Bucks a piece.
I would totally buy a Fluttershy shirt :3
I wonder if there are any UK shops that sell Pony t-shirts. I can't find any.

Whats up ScootaChicken
Lol!
dohoho UnFoundBug
im guessing Wrek is drawing?
What's with the other Pinkie pie with Suprise coloured mane and tail?
um
Pinkie was originally supposed to be Suprise
that's Suprise
I know that
i dont have any of the mane 6
But hey, does the OC have to be something like from pony creator?
But it isn't Pinkie
Thats why her first word was SUPRISE
I wish my name was as cute as the ponies in MLP are
i like how they use pinkie art on "flow wishes" but the actual model is different
Fazana: you refering to the purple Pinkie recolor?
that's Flower Wishes, apparently.
RaveBrony: no, but it makes it easier for us with ZERO computer drawing tools
I got a message, but I no can see :c
Ah, so it cant be just hand drawn? hmmmmmmm
Phase4: no, the model is the same.

Phase4: eeyup.
oh, so it is
pinkies hair looks a little pinkamena for me
...
looks like someone's got inspired by FMA?
alexxm: Pictureisunrelated is not good for your brain ^^
The point is, the pony on the left looks lie pinkie, but isn't Pinkie OR Suprise
05Sumica
I'm guessing those chips are man flavored, alexxm
00,10Yeah wrek?
I know
alexxm, thats actually a favorite wrestling move of children, as you can imagine...its very painful
Armstrong favoured :)
05cubernetics are hard to draw :C
05y*
00,10indeed
:o
They taste of manlyness
Fazana: yes. that's because to make more figures to be collected, they took the 5 basic pony models, recolored them, and came up with names for them.
You can do it Wrek!
Ahh
it's also why FLuttershy and Rainbow Dash have the same model.
00,10Big mac as Armstrong.
what happend to her arm?
anypony want to play TF2 with me? :3
00,10She tryed pony transmutation and payed the price to see the truth.
All I can say is "Seems legit"
Lawel
It epically failed
Sumica, what's your steam?
Is anypony going to play the Flutterrage sparta remix on here?
It's "Sumica"
I wanna
Wanna tf2
I do
I personally belive that Princess Celestia has too much power
-flies around room-
TF2
I beleive that Woona is underrated and underused
MEDIC
DOCTAR
Luna is best pony
by far
^NO
00,10check the bronystate steam group I am in there.
I'm not sure who's best
woof
DERPY IS
I bet Fazana pony is best >:3
No
I AM BEST PONY, DUH.
The best pony ever is
PINKIE
PIE
00,10Should show up if you look for sumica.
actually all ponies are equal
..
I'm not Joining, It'll make me "Obvious closet Brony is obvious"
WHO WANTS WAFFLES
00,10Any ways off to work i go.
Mee!
Wll none for you
00,10Wrek dont forget to send me a WiP on this please.
I'M NOT EATING THAT!
Rainbow: what colered waffles?
Sumica, do you mind if i add you?
00,10Go for it.
Simple
I'm gonna make a new spary for TF2
PIE FLAVOR

Try Kaspersky, works much better than AVG. I've had AVG in the past and half the time would detect the stuff, but failed to quarantine it.

NINJA: The Mission Force http://www.darkmaze.com/ninjathemissionforce/img/edglaser_sarahlewis.jpg
Syndicate: It's an axe and a mattock, it's pretty useful :3
Otakon: it's not like they're fast enough to get you anyway. You know you need a melee weapon and that's the bet of the best.
SuperBrony64: mine did too earlier, had a bunch of updates to install it seems
:D
Not a katana.
Lance
RandomNerd: mines an axe and a knife and a shovel and a hammer and a pick and a nail remover and the handle is wrapped in paracord. :3

The Crovel?
*jousts
11,01I just found out that I may haves saw a F5 tornado last year.
Yes.
I'd say a crowbar or a machete.
wtf a crovel?
Because utility is extremely important
11,01*have
CROVEL
pokemon blaze red is almost done downloading! :)
i would use a trench spike
And it's a crowbar
8 inch blade with brass knuckles for a handle
I LOVE PINKIES BREW SO MUCH!!!!
light wieght...
SOOOO MUCH
11,01I'm doing terrible today.
Crovel beats everything.
Hands down.
why isn't the stream playing?
CCCP: because you touch yourself at night
i can see that as one of the best
RAWRity: i touch my self in the morning too
A long crowbar, asid from being a useful tool, has a nice "business end", and no moving parts.
99%!
best time of day, CCCP
lmao
lol
What kind of Zombies are we talking about here ? the slow shambling kind or the "infected" type ?
But the Crovel is also a crowbar.
didnt think of that
do i need to break out the article about the ethics of killing zombies here?
taaaake oooon meeeeee

13too bad you can't stunlock the doom 3 mobs like you could 2
13do enough damage fast enough and they wouldn't get off a shot, best way to take on cacos was to spam them with chaingun
how can he not kill an Imp in one shot with the shotgun... just run up to them as the teleport in
13he hasn't memorized the spawn points :P
>_<
13plus not sure if you can one-shot them outside of easy diff..
I'd say Australia has more vicious creatures, even bicycles attack people
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1557/
13headshot maybe
you can... ive done it many times
saved my ass alot
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1869/
