/me is hugged
Saturn did you get the last vid i sent?
I require items of nutritional value, brb
lolk
Ugh
why has a drive refucking named it's self to T from K
I'm back
?
a lab?
08,01Ren & Stimpy
all the way
Ren and Stimpy, easily
luckly
I had to resort my programs because my HD type changed for some reason
I have NO idea why
Ren and Stimpy
/me hugs 8TB EHD
08,01Fazana: RAID?
TB = terribyte
EHD = external hard drive
anyway, brb
I had 2tb, but broke hte storage drive-
and I didn't understand Saturns message
I think he was wondering if you had it in RAID
08,01Dumori: lolwindows
I know Saturn
08,01what are these... drive letters?
the dumb bastard of an OS
08,01trolololo
there we go "fixed"
You'll excuse me while I go cheer now.
WHOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Grats'!
Cheers.
Translator.
/me hugs Saturn.
Yeah I fixed it
As a language student, that seems to be fairly acceptable for me :P
Hehehe
I'm reading EVERYTHING on their site first though.
Because my main thought just now is "so... what's the catch?"
08,01though, y'know, it's fine as a desktop OS
OS and ram and MB and drives where free
Nice
08,01Fazanaaaaaa
08,01come baaaaack
08,01i want to nerd out about harddrives with yooooou
hehe
x3
I accidentally bought 5400 rpm when I replaced my hdd
Somehow, I dont think its all that slow
to get them to work
I was too lazy this time to bother
hehe
Also hackentoshes are harder and hardr to pull off
hehehe
Even in the studio in the city we borrowed a mac, and it fried two audio cards
when was that?
2010-2011
as you need it to compile and sign
08,01to be honest, i get most my music through spotify, or on CD
08,01and i don't play games
Oh yeah listening to music its cd and spotify
yeah
08,01(the third is BeOS)
08,01(just kidding, it's MacOS)
Lately I've found way more entertainment through books than in games
08,01(now you need to decide which of those two statements is more horrifying)
08,01i did!
08,01i thought it was pretty cool, actually
Didnt it have like voice commands, sort of?
08,01i honestly can't remember
I dont remember much about it other than "Looks cool!"
08,01it was trying to be System 7 done properly, i think
Ahh
I'm back
I still build my own computer when Its time to upgrade but thats not really hard
Welcoma

I race replicas of these
Ahh
Since the real things are really expensive, we made replicas
Yeah
My nosecone is tonnes different though
I don't nkow much about cars but, it can be fun to watch
Mines a bitch to turn, but it's speed and accelleration is good
Yeah, it's alot- behind racing that I dont understand, you know techniques
Racing looks easu
But in real, it's really really really difficult
yeah
Its a pricy hobby
Because my old one collasped in a fast corner
I'm not sure
Lemme check
08,01Fazana: LVM?
Naerp
08,01do you have 4 drives lumped together as one?

i like to fly into the wall with 20000 kph
do you want the fez to go with it?
welp
i don't have a spare, but i've got plenty of spare metal and weapons to craft one
that isn't weird at all
though i reserve the right to charge reasonably for it <_<
what's next
is this a 13 episode series or is there more of it?
4ref - just the metal
well, back to studying cranes for me. be back in a few hours.

05DCD i have a razorback that is strange (orange) if you want ir, cant find anotehr machina though :(
09,01s'okay, I'll try getting it myself
There is a strange razorback?
09,01Holy shit she can make furniture mechas
05i can throw in a strange bushwacka though if you want one
09,01the strangeness doesn't affect the efectiveness of the weapon though right?
09,01Cause I got those
It counts the kills
05it counts kills
05other than that
05jsut the same
welp, there just went his house :\
09,01well I got the weaponry, all I'm missing from Sniper is that rifle you showed me yesterday. And maybe one of the knives.

wtf was that bs with rose at the end of the first anime?
noes!
the whole thing made 0 sense
well ed would be fukd
NO!!!
if Winry never existed yeah Ed would be fucked
the end to this series is the best end of any anime ive seen
yeah
I never drink milk.
but the end to the first one was sad :(
also, Pinoko! MAN! she was something back in her heyday
00,10the faces in this amuse me.

a circle
circles, equipment or tatoos
00,10so many honorifics

he really is nongendered
/me nods
A hermophrodite?

Morty: I'm thinking of Brotherhood, most definitely. During the 10 episode finale, she really doesn't have anything to do.
armstrong would win
Well, DUUUHH :o

Beiber is a celebrity, few live past 40.

Yay&
do you have a llink to that pic?
its very hard to make a living writing fiction though
I now have 9 internets :3
but here's just a little tip: Get an education in something other than writing.
Morty, have a dayjob
00,10I dont recall where i got it from.
dawwwwww
00,10Shizuka <3
13sumica~<3
If you write for necessity and not for fun, you'll lose interest quickly
I used to have about 100 internets, but I gave them all to Fluttershy.
00,10it might have been e361.....

the Mary Sue has been doubled
But there are only four.
which means that Celestia and Luna AREN'T the only Alicorns
.....just walks away
although Luna and Celestia aren't really that Sue-y
It still doesn't excuse Alicron OCs.
00,10the book is't really canon thought
Alicorn OCs just mean you went full retard. Simple as that.
Right, enough venting.
although alicorn originally just ment a unicorns horn

Luna-darned innuendos.
I'll go back to my fics now.
Cya.
i have a theory about greed going full armor
Yes?
hmm maybe
thats the only reason he wouldnt use it all the time
Perhaps...
but if that was the case, wouldn't ANY of the homunculi have that limitation too?
XD
Morty: why do you bring it up?
seeing him use it reminded me
Morty: bc he can't heal and armor up at the same time
one has to come after the other
and he was cocky for another reason
Morty: he was COCKY
its near the end
besides
Heck yeah
and he definately respected his opponent
Boot to the bucking HEAD
Animie crap
LAWWL

and that's all for today folks
That was good.

housewifes FTW
But I want more :O

00,10Sorry guys I have work in an hour

The Crovel?
*jousts
11,01I just found out that I may haves saw a F5 tornado last year.
Yes.
I'd say a crowbar or a machete.

Because utility is extremely important

CROVEL
i would use a trench spike
And it's a crowbar
8 inch blade with brass knuckles for a handle
light wieght...
SOOOO MUCH
11,01I'm doing terrible today.
Crovel beats everything.
Hands down.
why isn't the stream playing?
i can see that as one of the best
A long crowbar, asid from being a useful tool, has a nice "business end", and no moving parts.
99%!

But the Crovel is also a crowbar.
