No spoilers in the main chat, though.

And will last till around 7 AM - 8 AM EST
9tomorrow I'll stream some SRW Z2

hmm
9sometime early before the morning
`Fluttershy: hi
So when will S2 be here?
9before the movie night I mean
So, question: Best troll in Equestria: Trollestia, or Magneto?
It will last about 10 hours Season 1
9it has Gurren Lagann
i think im going to have to skip the marathon
theres only like 8 hours of show
hey `fluttershy
i need to get sleep if i want to wake up before 10
Assuming each episode will be 22 min
Tough question...
Trollestia!
wait
ok ill be idle for a while, i need to make my bed XD

9DAT GUNBUSTER
hey everypony
lol if I want to watch this marathon i'll probably have to sneak into my parents room in order to keep the internet on late at night
Why must you torment me dcd
Why will you need to sneak into your Parents room?
So curious, being as i recently just became a brony. Hope i don't offend,if i ask what you guys like about the show?
they're internet nazis -.-
they have a physical
timer
on the router
welcome to the herd
The Plot :P
IrOnLoRe: what isnt their to like?
there
ps2 is pissing me off
how did I just make that mistake
i need sleep
staying up reading fanfiction multiple nights in a row = bad plan
Me too... but I don't think I'll be able to get any
Sumica: You try getting a PS3 instead?
welcome, personally, i like the fact that its intelligent humour, contains nonarbitrary but smart references, and its everything a cartoon should be
You can't play PS2 games on a PS3, silly pony!
I dont play enough with em any more to warent geting it.
Coopmore: also ITS OVER 9000!
Not the new ones ;)
TerraH: Not the new ones, no.
meh
my not playing it in so long is probaly way it's derping.
that too
are you talking about a ps2?
I think the fan-base enhances the enjoyment of the show. Apart from the more...vocal weirdos there isn't anything that the fandom does that isn't awesome in some way
TerraH : Explain why I can play PS2 games on my PS3 then?
TerraH: If you had the original PS3, then yes you could.
whats being played? or supposed to be played?
I still have mine and it functions fine
9why won't Aeon Genesis hurry up with the Alpha 1 translation
/me trys a diffrent disk.
oh they took away the crosscompatability
9it has Gunbuster too
9and Eva
with the slim
and i think actually
SuperBrony64: As far as I know, the old ones barely played any of the old games, either. They were having too much trouble with that
anything but the original release
the slim is awesome
cant play ps2 games
i have a slim too
TerraH: Haha, no they weren't. I owned one and they worked fine. They removed it because the hardware to play PS2 games natively was keeping the price of the system too high.
god xboxs
dumb ps2
why won't you work
also i dont think you're ps2 should have proken
odd a ps2 that wont play ps2?!
broken
SuperBrony64: Ah, is that the problem. I never payed them much attention until the price went down
The new ones can only play PS1 games and PS3 games. There is the possibility to emulate PS2 games one the platform, but Sony hasn't done research with it yet.
OH GOD THE NOSTALGIA
i played battlefront 2 recently
and nearly died from nostalgia
hey guys, add me on steam, coopmore
...
games?
The original PS3 basically contained a full PS2 system on the motherboard.
Coopmore:
Battlefront.. Star Wars Battlefront?
...ok back to old game i guess
9also Sumica
9in SRW Z2
They condensed a ps2
shutterfly ?
You'd think they'd be able to figure out something better...
TrollightSparkle: yes, battlefront 2
and put it into the ps3
Coopmore: the steam games u play
then added something that recognizes the system differences
9one of the battle quotes for Simon and Kamina when using the Who-the-Hell-Do-You-Think-I-Am Kick is actually both of them yelling "SUPER INAZUMA KIIIIIIIIIIIICK"
lol nice.
Fuck yes.
<3
They were able to emulate PS1 games on the system perfectly so you can play original PS1 games on the new PS3s, but they haven't done anything to make PS2 games play emulated on the system.
Shutterfly a ballslods
yeah so it seems to be acting up with ps2 games
load
like 40+
lol ballslods
Epic-chat is so dead its almost painful.
alright
i only play lfd2 and tf2
Thanks for the welcome btw, and yes i agree with you coop,I never expected I'd like it as much as i do. I must say a lot of the fan works, are good also.
are the stars moderators?
Sumica: Throw it out the door and pick up another PS2 on the cheap :P
i have a tone of other pc games though
cant run tf2 on this crappy laptop so i play ut2004 on the crap comp
and ps3 games
yeah it's looking thatway
Coopmore: ah
good ol playstation logo the memorues
and audiosurf and stuff
MUTANTPANDA521: Moderators have colored text.
ps2 that can't play ps2 games
i just have too many games
might have to show anime or noting.
re4
nice, shadowbolt coopmore
0ya i got a warning for accidently using it..
yeah
I have a lot of PS2 and Game Cube, and Wii and N64 and Super Nintendo and Nintendo and Gameboy and DS and a few PS3s
how did you make the lightning
0never use color text?
is that in ascii?
its reseverd for mods awolf
Color text is only for Mods.
0aww, but i wanted to use black text
Plus it's just annoying if everyone used it.
problem with ps2 was it wasnt compatible with the ps2 games
I have three bookshelves worth of anime :p
AND the new Trigun movie
i copied from the leader, silentthought
bleach
portal 2 is a good game
old ps2 is old
always a few of us on the brony servers
Correction, Portal 2 is an excellent game.
lol have you guys seen the portal 2 endsong my little pony crossover?
theres a remixed song w luna
yes
It's set the bar real high for what I expect from a game today haha
i think it may have been on eqd at some point
portal 2 was good, but i think yahtzee was accurate, it just didnt live up because portal one was just too SURPRISINGLY good
0Dead space 2 all the way
Coopmore:…what?
theres a remixed song with luna of everything
portal 2 caught the world by surprise Coopmore
/me brohoofs MUTANTPANDA521.
*1
too much was expected of it
osu
like dnf. it was fantastic
wtf i _cannot_ type tonight
DEAD SPACE 1 IS BETTER -_-
never mind
srry caps
Is Dead space 2, any good?
0TrollightSparkle brohoof back'
Both Dead Spaces are better. /discussions.
Coopmore: I didn't expect any of what it brought in the game.
its amazing
i did not mean to compare to dnf
I have Deadspace 2... but I haven't played 1 yet, so I should get on that
Has /any/ game lived up to its hype lately.
?
uh
its great, but i thought it was too easy
0No. People overhype ALL the things
Well, we'll see about BF3.
TrollightSparkle: yes
bf3
um not that i know of
I thought that Mass Effect lived up to the hype...
the great thing about portal 1 was that all the walls were white
EA will ruin BF3.
slamost
Coopmore: Wait for DLC to come out for difficult tests.
In fact, they already have.
BF3, Uncharted 3, Rage..
Nittany_Tiger: thats quite the ultimatum
I hate publishers.
Although Rage doesn't look.. great.
so it wasnt merely trial and error, but true puzzlingness
cod mw 3
Nittany_Tiger: hard for games to exist without them
Nittany_Tiger: EA has been publishing Battlefield for the longest time now...
Ew MW3.
No offense anon.
MW3 is going to be alto more like cod4
anyone heard of just cause 2?
yes
Heard of Just Cause, wanted to play it.
call of duty is not an inherently bad game, but its community ruins the game
TrollightSparkle: its worth it
its great, but as tb said, its have gun shoot man
Shutterfly: I have Just Cause 2 on OnLive but I haven't really played much of it.
agreed coopmore
But many publishers are abusing consumer rights and milking gamers.
TrollightSparkle: the game is the most massive game i've over seen
I agree, an it's match making is bad.
most basic of game
games
It's a fun game that's very similar to the sandbox style of GTA.
Shutterfly Is it multiplatform?
Just Cause 2...
Coopmore: i just like the massivemenss
All you need to know
TrollightSparkle: not sure, i have it on ps3
Is that a parachute and a grappling hook
TrollightSparkle: Yeas it is, Xbox 360, PS3 and PC
BEST TRANSPORTATION EVER
Then yeah, probbaly.
Natleyn: indeed
you have infinite parachutes
I almost wish I had something like that at college.
that appear out of nowhere
The best transportation was the grapple hook in Goldeneye :p
0guess what is the best thing ever....oreos
Getting to class would be so easy.
its great in itself, and i love its local, because generally the people there are within punching range, so they arent acting like anuses
0The parachute obviously repacks itself.
the game completely disregards any realism
Oreos AND milk. Let's not leave that out.
There was no grapple hook in Goldeneye.
but somehow has reasonable physics
except when it comes to your character
Unless you're talking about the Nazivision version.
TrollightSparkle: Lets put it like this: You can surf a 747.
also the voice acting is deadly bad in an unapologetic way
There was a grapple hook in Nightfire, and Tomorrow Never Dies(I think).
0TrollightSparkle oreos and milk is gross..
the best transport is pigs in minecraft
Natleyn :O
Yeah there was. You culd swing around like Spiderman... I did it all the time
0grappling hook will rip your hand off
oh yeah u can do nearly anything
0so who likes driving helicopters in bad company 2?
cant wait for Skyrim!
helicopters in bf2 MUTANTPANDA521
battlefield 2 is still fun XD
What game is this now NewDCD?
I'm intent on trying Elder Scrolls and buying BF2.
0jets in BF3 shutterfly
MUTANTPANDA521: I KNOW
MUTANTPANDA521: i dont know why they took them out for bc2
and
1
elder scrolls is a great game of you like rpg's
I love RPGs
disgaea 4
the games and the rocket propelled grenades
the new one will not have classes so you can be what ever you want
0mass efect 3 all the way
You playing The Legend of Dragoon?
0effect*
Chrono Trigger!
so if you were like a mage and you want to be a theif then just do theif stuff
yes
Haven't played Mass Effect either.. I'm such an outcast ._.
0best rpg ever
TrollightSparkle: its a good series, but they're half movies
and it can be good fun, like knife fights, or pistols only and stuff
Mass Effect is such a wonderful series. I can't wait for 3
THEY NEED MASS PONY!
YES!
lol
there's probably already a fanfic
0BA *like*
TrollightSparkle: Me neither.
Or PONY FANTASY 13!!
battle pony 3
FF13 was.. alright.
lmmfao
i think my little pony may have the highest ratio of fan content hours to canon hours ever
modern warmare 3
I played the first Mass effect, just a little bit anyway.
I never cared for the Final Fantasy games. I was just naming a random number
Dead Pony :D
(Dead Space)
ff7 was the best in my opinion
grr u beat me to it!
Dead ponies aren't cool.. ._.
0TrollightSparkle *like*
Necromorph ponies on the other hand.. :P
how about pony space rather then dead pony
9oh hey guys
9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21AG8HWhk&feature=player_embedded
TrollightSparkle: dead space is just like STOMP ALL THE THINGS
Sounds better BA
Oh god... Dead or Pony... (dead or alive...)
9<3 enjoy your nightmares
damn it basically crashed
NewDCD: Redeads FTW
Haha Dragoon!
GOD no screw redead
to obtain items from people in deadspace you have to stomp their bodies
Dead Space 2 Shutterfly.
those give me the most intense jibblies
That game was awesome
when they explained that mechanic as a tooltip i was like .... why
0Pony Age?
PONYFRONT equestria is where the war is
In Dead Space 1, you just killed the necromorph and they would sometimes drop stuff.
0(Dragon Age)
deadspace 2
0pony space is much better than dead pony
u just curbstomped everything
that was what said
Meh, I'm not a fan of video games that are solely meant to scare the hell out of you.
Guitar Pony and use all of the remixes and fan music
im telling you PONYFRONT!
TerraH: is a win
amnesia is a game i would never play
Ponyfront sounds good.
But I am a fan of the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask. Go figure :P
ponerria?
Pony of Honor :3
0legend of PONY!
SuperBrony64: i still have my four swords somewhere

I need to thank them a million times over.
somepony
same here, i heard about it from ponychan cause of tomorrow's livestream
Ok, and it's supposed to be Legend of Dragoon then?
You could just use an IRC client and see everyone's name as a separate color.
SuperBrony64: too lazy
:P
*ahem* Whoever is in charge of this, if you're reading this, thank you very much, I appreciate it a lot!
Fluttershy77: are you trying to act in character as fluttershy?
I think he's too into his game :p
Naw~

That was me being nice.
DCD is in charge, I am just running the stream right now

Eep!
OH MAH GHOD!!!
Hugged by a stranger...
wait whats the 'aside' command
or whatever its called
ITs a Castle!
the natleyn hugs fluttershy and the like
you just type /me and your message
o3o
Just clarifying on something, Princess Celestia and Luna are both classified as Eagle Ponies…?
^What?
what? no they're alicorns SuperBrony64
Alicorns
Oh okay lol nvm
/me love this
lol, eagle pony
that what I thought
equals
Misheard the intro from the first episode.
/me loves this
a.k.a. pegacorn i think
but that just sounds dumb
Earth pony/Pegasus pony/Unicorn pony/Alicorn pony
But wait, that doesn't sound anything like what they said in the intro
They were like "There lived two Eagle sisters"
Unless I just misheard something lol
Regal
Anyone else Excited for the Chaos Dragon??
Oh OH OOOOOOOHHHH
:p
Oh um
Well
I like to remember it by thinking of Luna.
im sure theres a transcript somwhere
Since she was on the moon
where...aliens live..
Alicorn...
but um
XD
you don't have to say it like that
if you don't want...
I thought Alicorn was what the unicorn horns were made of?
'alicorn' also means the material that makes up
Luna is the best at Space! XD
unicorn horns
yeah
Alicorn is actually what unicorn horn is made from (at least, according to wiki)
its both
i always read that as "allcorn"
A pony with a horn and wings is normally referred to as a pegacorn or a unasis
Okay well um
because they have all the pony parts
Thank you all very much.
I'm glad you are all so friendly.
hi
Super muscles of a Earth Pony if thats a thing
Fluttershy77: bronies are generally friendly
MLP WIkia just says she is classified as a Winged Unicorn…that's good enough for me lol
That's what this community is all about! love and peace!
I'll be back here for the friday all-nighter
But until then.
Radical Fluttershy77
Have fun
It's time for me to lay my sleepy head
Good night then.
It's time for me to go to bed.
Good night Fluttershy!
Hush now
Fluttershy77: HUSH NOW QUIET NOW

Nope.

Goodnight T-Twilight? no...
Tomorrow.
That's what's in the engine car. It's full of magic :p
"MAGIC! *snort-snort"
How do you make friends on here?
Willzack, lol that was one of the discussions we about a week ago :P
Ask?
Can you save them as friends?
Oh, I don't know...
It's just a joke turns out lol
Don't think so...
oki gonna try and fail at a diffren dame for a bit, perhaps somthing with less quick time.
im pretty sure its alicorn unless a huge amount of fanficions are wrong
What if they don't want to be my friend?
Alicorn is the material that unicorn horns are made out of
They are
Case closed :P
Sure you'll be fine :)
/me waves a goodnight to the chat.
They will, Fluttershy77

Hockey is fun ^^
Sometimes it hurts my hooves.

That's what my friend was having trouble with as well until he opened his up and cleaned the lens
Dermathil: isnt it kinda a large place?
/me will continue to wonder on the matter after a night of sleep though.
I don't know how to wonder aloud.
Oh, night! :)
Anyone else here from CAL?
An endlessly looping PS start screen?
So.. now good night Dermathil?
G'night whoever is sleeping, lol
Willzack: if cal as in california then yes
Shutterfly: eeeyup, but most of the population is in the southern end of the province.
Dermathil: true, due to the climate
Sumica: Just open up the PS2 and expose the disc drive. Once in, wipe the lens with a Q-Tip and some rubbing alcohol in a circular motion. Then wipe again with a drive Q-tip in the same motion.
/me hugs Dermathil goodnight
when we visited disneyland

Nope.

/me is female
I bet my friend 5 dollars there would be twice the male apperances
/me knows 3 mods are female
Fluttershy77 is female...

When I get back on
TrollightSparkle: PoL music?

Shutterfly: Is there a parental timer with your internet?

SuperBrony64: its a physical timer on the power cable in my parents closet

billaxle ok
FORTUNATELY I don't have to work until 10 AM on Saturday.
Use X-FER!
Shutterfly Im up for a pony marathon to celebrate season 2!
lol
How long is the Marathon?
Until season 2 airs
Whoa...stream sputtered
9am
Huzzah!
About 9.5 to 10 Hours.
lol
TwilightSparkle: its going to be terrible when we get massivly cliff hangered after all that isnt it?
its a 2 part episode eh?
yes... yes it is
Eeyup.
YES shutterfly
9.5 is 24 episodes
10 would be 25
lol
They're technically about 22 minutes long, not 30 minutes lol
expect around 10 hours with breaks
That's where I get that figure.
Very true
so i guess 10 hours total if the new episode is right after
Billaxle: its 22 min each so 572 min aka 9.53 hrs
Multiply 22 minutes by 26
You get about 9.5
there will be breaks at eps 9 and 18
wait
Or 9.5 hours after dividing by 60
are there 24 or 26 eps in Season 1?
26
26 Episodes
*is scared of playing story of the blanks*
and they're completely out of order XD
lol ok, nevermind.
26 glorious eps
Tritoch OH NOES
youtube poop rotted my brain :P
this is an interesting reorder
Alright thanks.
I played Story of the Blanks; it triggered my "Zero Life"/Adrealine rush
Who else is going to be playing the metal version of the CMC theme during the talent show episode?
BrB, Bio...
Billaxle: as in AP bio?

>>
Without spoiling a thing, how many are completely clueless about what Season 2 is going to bring?
SuperBrony64: i've kept myself intentionally in the dark
I got spoiled some but I'm more of a "I'm gonna wait and see"
Shutterfly: I like it. I think I'm going to re-order my episode collection to reflect it...
i dont understand anyone who hasnt gotten a single thing spoiled for them if they frequent any pony site
FF4?
no...
whenever theres a hint of spoiler i instinctively ctrl w
I can totaly spoil the eps as i watch it all one min before you =p
Terra...
TerraH: i did that too XD

Equestria Daily, as one of the largest Pony sites, keeps spoilers away like crazy.

THIS IS HALO
FF3/6
It's blazblue. :|
Terra is FF6
This is FF VI

I think we should watch the new order of episodes tomorrow... or tonight...
Then I broke under and watched it :(

And changed in pitch
TerraH: im sure they'll show the marathon in regular order

/me facepalms as he forgot that this is IRC
Shutterfly: Like?

Shutterfly: Well duh, Ponies come first.

hush
and memebase
well at least im not as bad as RBD

Here's your Pony fix: http://youtu.be/ZzIg0s7eKxs
Trolls die in the silence
we probably got rid of him via not saying anything for a straight minute
eeeeeeyup
hi
darn
so anyway, who read lauren fausts interview?
that was great
me KanyeEast
i concur
she's quite the character
did she say she wasn't on the production staff anymore?
she is KanyeEast just pre-production though
but theres also and audio interview with what you could say is her 'replacement'
Her Team is good enough to make it epic
and he seems like a boss too
and its not as if
she animated it
from what i've seen, probably even MORE epic!@\
wrote it
lol Billaxle thats the hope
but probably
when has a show gotten worse in season 2
don't answer that
there is going to be a chaos dragonpony
its more than just hope, lol.
usually a reasonably good show doesnt go downhill production wise till like season 4 at elast
and this show is epic win
or if they make a movie
so i dunno
swhoah a movie
i dunno how that would work
9>Spend 4 bucks in a 0.3 mm Mechanical Drawing Pencil
probably some epic adventure story
9>3 days from the purchase date, it jams and is rendered unusable
9Fucking Staedler
PONIES
NewDCD: writing utensils are serious business
no wait
still not ponies
dayum, that sucks NewDCD
Billaxle: that is pretty unlucky
i personally like pens though XD
i haz fountain pen
Mechanical Pencil > pens
i have a pony irl
I prefer the manga pens i can buy online : P
i keep it in my house like a dog
KanyeEast: we're all entitled to an opinion
like a fountain pen, but with an actual point indstead of a ball
yeah
its fine to like pens, I use quite a few myself
a nib its called
it lives in its own room
its alluminum
just the whole "un eraseable" part
KanyeEast: it is a problem, i hear they make a magical potion called white out though
the nib isn't changeable
it is
yeah but when you're trying to take like 400 notes a second
if it breaks i can change it
So perhaps this guy should be BlueBlood? =p
its a literall fountain pen
unless you swap out the nib from an evirely different pen
9can't even find my Oh-Fives now
using capillary action
its a changeable nib...
locke? why are you adventuring with an english philospher from the enlightenment?
its designed with a ink release part attached to the nib
a
u kno like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen
and uses ink cartridges
yeah
exactly
Why do they even call it a fountain pen? It doesn't even shoot out the ink like a fountain...
its not like calligraphy pens imean
well
where the nib is just one small metal peice stuck in a hole
those are slightly different
lol
cause those have
a specific nib
GOD I LOVE THIS THEME!!! >.< *NOSTALGIA!*
just a dif nib really though like a broad one allowing a range of line thickness
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE PONIES
If Nintendo just went straight to CDs for their Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy would have been on the N64 and possibly on the Gamecube.
9I'll have to use an Oh-Seven
9*groan* I hate Oh-Sevens
9too thinck
9desertponi: the marathon is tomorrow
FUCK THAT
SHIT STARTS NOW
desertponi: just ignore him
NAME HIM RARITY
just ignore that guy
OKAY
He's trollin NewDCD.
9I know
HE WAS TOTALLY RARITY
or just love/ tolerate him
Haha finally
Edgar is totally Applejack anyway
Was just like "Any moment, the ban hammer is gonna come out..."
SuperBrony64: the sad thing about trolls is they tend to get a kick out of getting kicked XD
and his brother is Big Macintosh
same you know the 6 letter only for names
9yeah
9but that's a warning kick
Shutterfly: Maybe so, but there's always the permaban hammer.
9if he bothers too much I'm placing a ban
When is he allowed back?
Which I believe is Gold Plated and has diamonds on the handle.
in 1000 years
he WAS annoying, but i can tell he wants the stream. lol
they should get banhammered to the moon for 1000 years
That's quite a long time.
lol, thats how it works on my mincraft server : P
its not like he was trying to plunge the stream into eternal darkness or anything
9he already is
That's how they do it for Xbox Live permabans. They set the ban-lift date to 12/31/9999 or something.
KanyeEast: brohoof
/me brohoof
Epic Brohoof
hold on who's getting the banhammer?
noone, Yet...
Desertponi is about to Coopmore
Or was...
oh god star trek
ah i expected so

thats may favorite episode KanyeEast
Haha
9so yeah
Kirk being all awesome
…now I want to be kicked :(
9kicks are more warning-ish than anything
spok: very perceptive creatures
spock
i was like "HUH?!? Whaddidido?!" lol
9yes
Lol, didn't know you could kick yourself...
9I am so alpha I can kick mysel
meta kick
9*myself
Mods, i'm happy for you and all. and i'mma let you finish. But snacks being banned was the best mod action of all time
Kickception, lol
of all time!
Careful NewDCD! You'll upset NewDCD into giving you a permaban!
9LE GASPER
Is that Chrono Trigger or Cross being played?
Damn, resorting to French I see. God, can't understand it at all...
lolololololololololol
I thought it was Final Fantasy..
Its FFVI
oh ok
the font and castles look similar haha
It's the Final Fantasy, last one.
hehe
/me seems to have forgoten where to go next
we should TOTALLY Do the PSX Chrono Trigger after this!
I miss playing it, but I can never get past that clown boss thing..
I have the DS version is quite good
We should do Super Mario Galaxy 2 if you ask me, after this :P
I'm waiting for the clown boss in THIS game >:}
or galaxy 1
its saoundtrack was saweet
Coopmore:…Or Galaxy 2 *narrows eyes*
or a playthrough of this hilariously badly translated pokemon crystal http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ_bhwCgtXg
go shopping!
you need shitloads of potions!
or perhaps galaxy one... *twitches*
haha those badly translated games are as fun as watching MLP with youtub's Closed captioning on
but this one
is god aweful and the commentators are good
"WELCOME! IT'S ELF'S WORLD!" Hahahaha
its a chinese bootleg version from vietnam
REGISTER Axlgh
Then the rival was a monster XD
translated to engrish
it gets pretty epic
ah here we go
I will Collect all the Monaters!!!
theres this part where the rival calls you trashy and talks about how you take trashy strolls
I have the psx of crono, it came with this game
Totally,
but
wait for kefka scene
Do it after that
never played it though =p
oh, then this is going to be goood!! >:}
theres like 56 parts now though XD
they call the main character, they chose girl, eggie XD
you need to go to the other towers and talk to the little girl
and whenever you place an item in the back its like eggie drug back f*ck
SWEETIEPOO
Geh. x_x
drug is potion XD
the translation is so bad
Sorry 'bout that. This froze up
And Whoo! Birthday time for me!
Pokemans are a hell of a potion
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! >:U */end Cake Boss*
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday.
HAPPY BIRFdAY!
happy bday?
ugn bbl

Oooo tasty!

so are like half of you watching the pokemon lets play? cuz i'm still watching kefka fantasy
Hello? >:

the only appropriate youtube videogame stream is of sirronlionheart
Ghod

<-- is Billaxle
WHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!! >:}
I hear my ringtone, but it's not coming from my phone o.o

bastards stole our idea
Hello Vanilla.
Haha, they copying us.
Hello ;w;
Um, is there a way on turning off that imageshack watermark on the video?
It's.. a bit in the way..
Dont you mean the Scyfi channel?
lolz
syfy now
I don't really know >: All I see is a yellow frog
I.. I suppose ;w;
Hellow.
laskjlgiajdrloyjalsdrkjtlaskyds ;-; i just want s2
hey o!
Dr. Who For the F***in Win!
they should stop playing all their "original movies/shows"
I'm not sure Vanilla, sorry
In how many hours does season 2 start on here?
It's okay ;w;
and yes, dr.who is amazing
1 day and about 7 hours I think..
Wonder how many people will be here for the marthon.
Ok
I thought the watermarks only show up on the video if you mouse over the video
Thanks.
i bet we hit 1000+
more like
OVER 9000!!!!!
that wouldn't make a bit of difference
@Sumica - No sadly.. ;w; Maybe it's just in my case. Mine is just there.. all the time.
because the stream would become inert
I'm just gonna say that the movie was a bad idea
a very bad idea XD
you guys should stream The Room at some point! lol
oh god, theres been a glitch in the game matrix
eh?
oh, it hought it was just repeating
it was
Chocobos out of F***ing Nowhere!
lol
the best kind of chocobo?
Deffinetly sleeping through bladrunner and mlp movie
so where does kefka get all his amazing unstoppable powers?
Castle Lagaan!
lol so whos stream are we watching then?
waking up for the season runthrough, and then watching the new episode. Then working for 11 hours.
Sumica
Oh joy
i have no idea anymore, lol
Uggh…I'm hungry again :/
I never really liked Kefka...XD
Drink water? ;w;
Jon Irenicus is my favorite rpg villain of all time
Sumica! you can do Chrono Trigger anytime you feel comfortable now. :]
Mine was probably...Kain,does Kain Highwind count?
He was technically both good and bad...
or how about Kane?
Kane?
I ate a 4x4 at In N Out and I'm still hungry :/
Oh I love these~ Cutscenes during a fight!
from command and conquer
THAT WAS FRIENDSHIP, BITCH!
why are they chatting in the middle of a fight?!?!
Cuz' FFVI is awesome
very polite enemies
Idk those machines could like...eat them
nomnomnom
What is this I don't even?
lol the bad guys have nothing better to do anyway
will wait for stream to catch a bit up then will swap games after a hort break.
Surprise buttsecks?
gah,
That's not even funny...
why is that your name, lol.
XD
Because it's an awesome name
love the sound blaster btw
Are they livestreaming themselves playing Final Fantasy?
i didn't even know o_0
lol DCD
lololololol
Terra reminds me of Fluttershy..
In a way, Terra annoyed me during Dissidia though
too emo
Couldn't play her worth a crap but when you fought her she could kick your ass
NewDCD: And so begins his story...
and yeah,too emo
nothing makes me more annoyed than unlikeable characters in an rpg
9you know
like morrigan
Which is why I don't touch Dissidia
9when Duodecim was just released
Morrigan...Morrigan....Dragon Age?
9I wanted to draw humanized ponies as the cast
I never played Dissidia.....
yeah, dragon age morrigan
wait
god she annoyed me
NewDCD: That's not a bad idea :P
When did we start playing Mario Kart?
thats what made me not like playing dragon age
Can anyone here see what I'm typing?
half my party members bitched when I wanted to do a side quest
oh ffff bumped the cahnnle button.
We playing Mario Kart? Where?
Yeah, sten even attacked me once -_-
channle even
9like, Big Mac as Laguna, Rarity as Sephiroth, RD as Lightning
9ect.
Chrono Triggah!
sten/morrigan: God I can't believe we're saving X even though its obviously to our advantage to have allies
9I actually tried drawing Caramel as Laguna
9but it was so horrible I decided to scrap it
Rarity as Seph?
r u serious?
I knooow...Sten attacked me in the Shale quest....
Speaking of which, anyone wanna play Mario Kart Wii?
so i chilled with alistar and the church chick
if any of the main 6 are Seph, its Pinke
9>Pinkie
9>Sephiroth
9>not Kefka
because they're cool
typo
9get out
Lilyana, lol she's awesome, if I'm not mistaken she's in DA2 too....
que?
9also
.....You know.....
9Exdeath is Fluttershy
9OHOHOHOHOHOHOH
DA2 kinda sucked though...
Oh Ghod...
I've never really seen Gurren Lagann.
lawl
NewDCD:…how…how could you??
you know has likeable companions? The nameless one
if any of you played torment
But after seeing the Super robot wars attacks, I really REALLY want to.
Nobody wants to play Mario Kart?! :O
Torment huh?
Y'KNOW WHAT? SCREW IT. PLAY SUIKODEN 4!!
9also
Planescape Torment
lol
9Celestia as Cosmos duh
9and Twilight as WoL
Never heard of it :D
Gurren Lagann, is really good Vergil
Earthbound
WoL, from the trailers, looks like a traitor :o
OOOooh!
Dragon Quest 8... <3
9I'll stream the compilation movies on Saturday
Earthbound is nice!
All I really knew about it before seeing the SRW stuff was that apparently you got manlier just by shouting "Who the hell do you think I AM!"
Wahg!
optimus...decepticons?
Wh.. what's this?
HUB
thats a transformers I haven't seen before
lol!
...
lol
What? Who? i don't even..
Haha, random TV.
Hub too
I bumped the channle button on wintv
But apparently, there's a lot of bad ass battles I haven't seen before.
Wouldn't it be great if there were playing My Little Pony at that moment
<333 dat ps2
Know what was an awesome game?
classic ps1 is classic
too late for that SuperBrony64
Dark Cloud
I miss my ps2 ;w;
Dark Cloud 2!!!
Chrono Trigger?
and yeah, me too Vanilla
Sumica: Never too late for PONIES!
I love playing mount and blade
slash Dark Chronicle
chrono cross
but to me it just becomes "Berserk the game"
Dark Cloud
too late time wise
CRONO TRIGGER! DO EEET!
I'm so confused
Dark Cloud was one of my favorite games
Crash Bandicoot?
Also Demon's Souls
HAve we had a vote for Earthbound yet?
Toan was a very likeable character
so was Xiao
ME Earthbound
If not I vote Earthbound infinity times.
Sumica is like, a minute ahead of use
yay!!!
us* if not more
lol
Chrono Trigger?
Dragon Quest?
o:?
Dragon Quest? <3

Never had the pleasure of playing this game before.
I'm okay with this
sup bronies
PREPARE FOR EPOCH!!!

and DBZ styling
Hey Josef.
Nice.

Chrono Trigger
The music in this game is amazing.

Ayla.
Awww, yeah.
Lol that guy reminds me of Omega from sonic
Ayla

oAo;;;
Random pause?
why it stop
idk :o
D:
Cause I control all that you see and hear

Let's just go to the Corridor of TIme level and stand in the lobby. JK
Well make us see and hear good stuff dang it
instead of black and silence

indeed i do but they are a pain to set up so i wont mess with them right now
I wanna join in the the 2PM EST stream.. but by that time it'll be 2AM from where I'm from.. ;w;
at least we get to see the cutscene again! @w@

9>Ayla was hawt
9finally
9a man after my own heart
but Vanilla, does season two start at 2pm east, or just the movies start then
gonna warn you all I have never played this
It's cool Sumica, just enjoy it :D
what are you talking about, Josef? ;w;
i knew a guy who basically killed everything with Ayla's Dino Tail
Are you talking about season 2, or the streaming here?
Damn straight, NewDCD,

like, he literally 1-shot early lavos with it
I think he means the streaming of Season 2 on here?
ep 201 will be live at 6am pst 9am est
tommorow
No.. ;w;
on saterday the 17th
Ayla had it goin' ON.
x slash :D
hey Sumica, what time central?
aw shit thats like 3am here
but ponies are worth it
Um.. I think you've mis read something.
8am cen
currently 10:45 where i'm at
pm
Lol Josef, yeah, I stayed up till 3 am for the Bronyshow Mareathon
if you were in the original room you would recognize me ^_^
hey again all
Hi people
any other germans in here?
You guys are gonna stream the new episode, right?
Oh hey! your back just in time for EPOCH! : P
PonyFace: thats right
sweet
sweeeet :D
:)
called it ^_^
/me glares at the froggy watermark
PonyFace: at around 6AM PST on saturday
What did I miss?
Well, i have to get going guys, I'll talk to use later, have a good Night,
is the running concensus
Nice
well super brony
they streamed episode 2
night IrOnLoRe
Night IrOnLoRe
early
I've got a facebook group with about 200 bronies looking for a place to watch.
and now youll never see it again
Josef: what do you mean?
Probably 20 or so will actually tune in here.
Haha, I was gone for like 5 minutes
im just kiddin around
tomorrow is going to be so awesome
oh lol
cant waitttt
SuperBrony64: what's the video quality like for the live stream of the episode?
hey guys..... ive been thinking
hard to tell when all i've seen so far is like 64 color games XD
Tomorrow night to Saturday morning
what if it sucks
like really bad
WELL wtf is this
Josef: it won't :P
....
It won't, I asked Lauren Faust myself :D
i think imma need some 5hour energy, lol
i know it wont
but like
what if it does
and she replied on dA :D
Shutterfly: Should be better than before, they're using a better stream application.
alright
I want to say it will be pretty good, but it might not be HD quality.
and Josef why would it be any worse?
Bearable till someone uploads the HD version on YouTube :P
I need muffins...
Cuz Lauren quit pretty much?
lol im so used to my 720 p torrents and 1080p dvrs XD
remember the star wars prequels
I just want to see the new Ep, when it happens, as it happens, lol.
WHat is it exploded, and then exploded again?
She went from being head of everything,to nothing :P
mib_s8e07m: Ditto, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse...
why would those be any worse than the amazing originils
Surprise: she's still part of the pre-production staff
yeah but thats all
WHat if TYPO
she was over almost all of it
lol
she stepped down A LOT
A lot of people say the SNES version is superior to the PS1 version of Chrono Trigger.
SuperBrony64: I hope they come out with a game like the show soon.
Surprise: its not like she did animation, script, or anything esle but managment basically
you also forgot to grind out 5000 gold : P
Actually if I'm not mistaken she was head storyboard designer (or something like that)
mib_s8e07m: Same here, but if the creators don't then fans will.
Surprise: she gave the show direction, the 20+ rest of the staff isnt going to suddenly make a u-turn
she was partially that
I know that, but still
However, if they don't have any say from the creators on making the game, then it will be pretty bad like previous MLP games.
^
THE NEW EPISODE HAS A CHAOS DRAGONPONY!
THAT IS ALL.
lol?
wut
Willzack: lol yeah the new villans look cool
But here's hoping they work with the people who actually make the show!
Lol yeah
no spoilers about Q
actually I think he has a more normal name than that
But I'm also hoping for a Mario-Kart-esque MLP Kart game
and yeah
no spoilers
i feel kinda dumb im the only person who put their actual name
its not spoilers because its shown on the HUB website, lol
...
Josef: lol its fine
Actually it is Willzack
Really?

Willzack: its still spoilers
because people want to be suprised tomorrow
It's says "MLP Season 2 SPOILER"
and yes...i say tomorrow
yeah
is the name of the show
because today is FRIDAY
fine, sorrry
oh my god Kanye
you don't know what you almost just started!
Anything revealing the plot even if it's just saying Fluttershy saying hi to Angel is considered a spoiler.
Its not 7AM yet thought
though*
Rebecca Black is everywhere >.> <.<
well 9 AM is when it starts on eastern time
It's not tomorrow, it's on Saturday
also spoilers are an insta ban apparently
today is friday

so it is tomarrow for me too
okay, sorry. won't happen again
Shutterfly: This. Don't spoil anything during Movie Night or you'll be gone.
Sibsy plays Rebecca BLack in the Storyboard room every Friday.
you guys are in the future
Not to you though Shutterfly, just making a public statement :P
oh right, thats a good idea actually

SuperBrony64: i was like... whut

ctrlx: stay up all night tomorrow, duh
i plan to buy 10 energy drinks
Obviously the latter.
Willzack, I'm sure everyone has seen the episodes before that will be here, but I wouldn't do it for the sake of those that haven't watched the show yet and are interested.
ctrlx: i say the former
oh and i'm buying cereal and milk so I can eat it while watching the new episode
SuperBrony64: i agree wholeheartedly
GOD KANYE GENIUS IDEA
KanyeEast: favorite companion in dr who?
Note to self: Go to store tomarrow...
because its Saturday morning and to do otherwise is blasphemy
in nu who? rory
i need a tie breaker
lol rory is a boss
I haven't seen enough of the classic who to form an opinion
i can never decide
ctrlx: the former is better unless you've not seen all the episodes
KanyeEast, eat cereal in a GYRO-BOWL! :D
but I hear one of the doctors has a robot dog as a companion
oh god gyro bown

Its like you can eat rasins on a roller coaster!
A CMC gyra bowl mini meme happened a while back,
ctrlx: watch this with us?
Uh-oh, I foreshadow something bad happening
Surprise, bandwidth limit
She's not going to reappear..
Theres enough energy in that pendant to punch a hole in the univers!
that would never happen :)
universe*

Teleporters always do that to me.
i really don't want to continue working on my program. threading is pissing me of

SuperBrony64: wait is actually
apparently green riding balls is stronger than green standing.
whoa u can pick the colors u want XD
lol, anyway. BrB, Bio
what game is this
Chrono Trigger
Really?! *reads listing again*
Oh hi chick I came to save.
I can see then arranging to get Applejack and Pinkie Pie, but Rarity or Twilight is just too busy to be bothered.
Oh, here is for those who wish to die by CUTENESS OVERLOAD: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/57427
'Boy & girl colors available, glitter pony, my little pony or western colors.'
dawww
If I was a kid at the party, I'd be pissed.
how did i even end up with almost 240 mlp related songs
240?
yeah XD
I have over 400 and 26000 pony pics to go through...
That's like bringing a bunch of rodents wearing red pants and calling them "Disney" characters.
oh god
did u see video of the my little pony live show
facepalm
>SuperBrony64 uh thats pretty much what disney is
guh
he means real rodents in reality
I know
XD
with red pants
it'd be pretty odd XD
check out my pony wallpapershttp://www.liveshare.com/#&id=1614721&tab=following
Something aint right about the cathedral >.>
oh yeah i have those too actually
im using the twilight one currently
On the front page of Ponibooru there's a funny image, but it's suggestive so I'm not posting the link. It involves Applejack and Rarity and it is teh lulz
where?
im on teh front page
oh under the QC banners?
same i dont see it
is that the comic one
look before you sleep
haha, nice one
oh god
the comic one is epic XD
pretty win
how long till season 2 ep starts
lol yes
yes it is shutterfly
It starts 9 AM EST on Saturday
or 8 AM Central :D
whoa the live share thing is epic too
i are be australian
ikr
ep 201 is 30 hours away
201?
lolwat
s2e01
i only thought there were 27....including season 2 episode 1
aka 201
lol
this ones cool
they are so gonna blame me for that.
like the pink floyd album cover
http://www.wallchan.com/images/sandbox/21922-mlp-prism-my-little-pony-rainbow-dash.jpg
who knows a realy good file sharing site
mediafire?
OOh ooh! Piratebay :D
need a better file size limit for free
you mean torrenting?
mediafire then
how big?
demonoid, if you're looking for torrents
There has been a fatal error
like up to say 500mb pere upload
Marle.exe will now terminate
im not sure
media fire has a good limit
Error while close Marle.exe
200mb
i was using
try rapidshare?
ah damn they only go to 200 yeah
suddenly the universe broke!
lol
i doubt many places will do half a gig for free
Piratebay if you know how to use torrents
and science chick with the exposision.
Piratebay will if you use it right :D
what are we watching?
Get u-torrent
and then DL all pony
OH GOD ITS CLONING ITSELF
yeah but that requires me to have it constantly seeding unless others seed
from Piratebay
torrenting is easy enough.
i know
Stop the presses!
oh fu think that is keeping the boxes locked
is that counter to next stream broken? every time I've come in it's said now but nothing is ever streaming.
is easy
New wallpaper: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/58683
Use piratebay or ISOhunt
thing*
it is easy but he's trying to distribute
not get himself i thin
think
yeah
i want to upload
Mediafire or youtube?
only 2 i can think of
he said like 500mb files
what kind of files anyway?
ponys folder
surely not music or video for that size per file
its a bit oiver 200mb
Billy,do you have 26000 pony images like I do?
No...mine is 6.27gb in the pictures themselves...
SuperBrony64: i set that as mine too XD
i have about 8 gigs in brony pics, lol
swoah
i don't have any
Shutterfly: Haha, I love it! BTW, careful when looking at the other images. A lot of spoilers.
i just have a lot of music
i have 6.something gigs in pony pics
2.7 in music
and like 8 in video
no music...
how do u have that much in music?>
mines 217mb but i havnt dowloaded any folders just selected one by one
FLAC files?
i just like lurking ponychan, lol.
lol yeah Will
I have practically every picture ever posted to Ponychan...
i have like 3 gigs in music acutally
lol didnt even realize
i want to upload them
lol, ok. maybe i don't have 8 gigs then
but i can safely say
u can partition it billy
it may be outdated though
that i have more ponychan images on my HD
god i dont wanna update this
XD
than i have of any other kind of pics
why do u even save them to your hard drive?
wtf
all of you
i browse for them
why do i have a 34 folder in my pony folder?
and like them
but never saw the point
i have some nice ones
of downloading them
34 of ponies should not be allowed =_=
actually, i just realised
what's the benefit
there is a folder with more pics than my brony folder
but its my pron folder so i didn't really count it, lol.
Willzack: tmi
lololololololol
Oooh I have an Epic folder in my pony folder....
OwO
Willzack: also im not getting any answers
oki geting bored of Crono. so time for some random.
Yay random
aww yeah
to what questions, Shutterfly?
lets watch the hub? :D
XD
whats the benefit of downloading the pictures when you can just see them again on the internet
lol, yeah. Random hub Stream
to browse them when on an airplane or something?
having them all in 1 place,shutterfly
if you think you wont find them again
i guess
theres also _bookmarks_
Anyone here?
some images get deleted
^_^
thats true
seriously, chances are you might not see the same image again

DRAGON QUEST!
The SNES was one of the best systems ever made.
The SNES was THE Best system Ever Made!
what about the N64? XD
: P
It had some amazing games for sure
Shutterfly: Lol, nope, not even close.
N64 was great, but i had a PSX
but the games on the n64
oh god my aunt
had a dreamweaver
i was like
DreamCAST
Eh, I remember back when I had my n64, I regreted not geting a playsation due to lack of games.
lol
ohyeah
i was like 5 XD
If Nintendo came out with another console with exactly the same specs as the SNES and told developers "Make games for this now!" I would be happy.
dream cast
lolol
snes had some great music.
but in retrospect i wasnt sure how it even existed
in 3-d space
its like magniets and rainbows
you cant explain that
how did it work?
although rainbows come from rainbow dash clearly :P
Well.. there's a lot online now...
and nyan cat
im uploading my pony folder in two parts but australia has poor internet so upload are going to take some time

/me braces for spam
Hey again Kencolt.
how is the guy going to be streaming the show does he have a tv tuner card or somethin in his pc
Which since I'm by nature, fierce-- and occaisionally furious-- makes sense to me.
Yes the guy has a capture card billy
swoah how have i not seen this yet
sweet
sounds good
What IS this Download-playnow thing at the top of the window?
This shit is Awesome
Some day I want to be the guy....oh wait I am the guy
Hold on to your Butts
this is kind of wierd too.
Kencolt: An ad.
how can this even happen???
wait whats this video called?
Ponies the Anthology
"Friendship is not available in your country" this and this "Friendship is Magnets"
PONIES: The Anthology
it's coppyed from the AMV hell format.
Ths first time aI ever say that episode that songe came to mind.
btw this is the video that got me started on the path to Brony
Time to watch, DE MAGICS!!
same here, sumica!
katamari XD
oh god this is too epic
YT betrayed me and recomended it to me one night
Every time I watch the anthology, I tell myself I should rewatch Pi during this part, and forget about it once the video ended.
I watched it, then watched it again,showed it to my guild watched it with them. Then went and watched ep 1-7
Rarity sidespitting.
dat horn
oh look it's friday here now.
lol about time sumica
2 hours behind me....
oh hey yeah,
Oh why, yes it is
Happy Friday everyone!
it just became Friday!
Yeh FML when I have to get up at 5am for all of you so you can see ep201
Oh, look. It's Friday.
Sittin in the front seat…sitting in the back seat...
lollooolol
NO!
None of that -_-
sleep? whats that?
XD
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBEE95EB3074C83F
None of that either.
Chili Bowl.
THAT should SO have Fluttershy adding, 'Just chillin. drinking a Bud."
Yesterday was Thursday. Today it is Friday. Tomorrow is Saturday, and Sunday comes afterward.
GINGERS HAVE SOULS!
Nu-uh
lol
lol wow stream is soooo far behind me now.
XDDD
lol
Haha, Secret Butt Fun.
I love this part...
I am on the FOREVER part already
They don't really care for you~
I like the Apple Blossom song
!
LAZOOOOR!
yeah same brony
Apple Bloom is the best pony btw.
No.Rarity or Vinyl Scratch
not sure which, but one of them
/me likes AJ
No, Rainbow Dash
Or at the very least, the best Filly.
She's decent. Won't bite her.
Or Fluttershy....
Rainbow Dash is too overdone
who the heck is vinyl scratch?
DJ P0N-3
Rainbow Dash is 20% cooler than anypony else.
mmm
Appeared as something of a BG pony in one ep.
Grim, your logic is old XD
yeah, thats what i was trying to get at, lol
That doesn't make it wrong.
lol rainbow dash may be cool,but thats no means for best pony :P
Lord of the Ponies
WHOOOooo are You!
lol CSI Ponyville :P
?
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBEE95EB3074C83F
Gildaaaa -_-
lolololololololololollollol
Dear princess celestia
lol
And I ran~
this is the only part i would remove
Applejack really hasn't had a defining moment...
CSI vegas takes a whole new twist when you know where they are.
Fluttershy had Dragonshy
idk, i think riding RBD bareback was pretty defining
Rainbow Dash had the Rainboom
lolz
AJ had Applebucking Season?
It wasn't defining at all though
defineing moment of shipping perhaps
well i gtg for the night
other than "she over works herself."
cya all for the marathon tomorrow
FOREEVVVUUUHHH!
cya
bye Shutterfly
See ya Shutterfly
Rarity had the dress episode
Pinke? Pinkie?!? PIIINKKIEEEE!!!!!!!!!
And the diamond dog episode
I have to miss all the fun.
Latter, Shutterfly
G'night
Itreally does define AJ, tho-- it shows how she just will not quit. EVER.
lolololol
Twilight had the first 2 episodes
stupid work and needing it to pay for stuffs.
I love the Pinkie Pie/Woody Woodpecker crossover
Fluttershy had that photo episode too
Sumica: Apply for a job with Ponies
Pinkie just won all around
fyi this song is called "Maccaron Chaccaron"
I dont think I can pay bills with bits
GO GO POWAH RANGAHS
Offspring ftw
ITS OK CUZ I LIEK THE ABUSE!
inwayb4 SPACE!
Willzack: Yeah and the top comment for the video on YouTube says it all "The most retarded song on the planet"

Sumica, you might wanna get that fixed with google
google bronystate and it sends you to dinkypages
idk if its just the fact i LOVE this video, but i think WRoundup is the best 8-bit MLP song. :/
I followed the RD.net link
google tends to updat it's self when they send out scans
linked here from Ponychan
i also think that EQD said something about dinkypages too
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBEE95EB3074C83F
could be wrong though...
So the new episode is gonna be live on Saturday?
8 am for me
so sumica, youve chosen the next stream vid right?
what about australia
yeah I am some ways ahead now.
Pinkie and the Brain... short and brilliantly timed.
What time is it there Billy?

Yes,yes they did...And I can...
Rocky, Madam le Flour, Mr. Turnip, or Sir Lints-a-lot?
In fact...I'm breaking it right now.
Look behind you. >:)
Or is that just what I WANT you to think?
yyrtetwdxbk

Does Pinkie control the vertical and the horizontal?
ARRRHH what a Surprise!
the stream is loading forever. what do?
Yes
I'll put it this way
Pinkie controls energy, Yin and Yang
I control Wuji, the lack of all energy :D
=D
(I mean, look at Pinkie's family, It makes sense right?)
if you can see this message, say something
I can see this message and I'm saying something.

question: is there a repeat on saturday of movie night?
uh
saturday IS movie night
oh wait
no thats tonight..
woah, season 2 spoilers are an instant ban?
would it be a spoiler to say that it involves ponies?
SPOIL =D
i did't kow that!
spoiler: the episode is NOT live-action
What time does the streaming start of the show?
depends on where ypu live
you*
NJ
NJ? XD?
*SPOILER ALERT*
The episode takes place in Equestria
i can't think of any pony puns for NJ lol
also just a note, the jersey shore is not what NJ is like lol
New... Jockey...
well i know that tomorrow at 3pm im gonna watch that episode (europe time)
Though that wouldn't work with no humans. :P
thought what wouldn't work?
humans? i thought there only was ponies here =D
by ponies you mean no bronies? u mad? lol
Jockey is a horse racing athlete. I was making a terribad joke along the lines of "Fillydelphia"
I thought Fillydelphia was kinda clever :3
Yeah, I was referring to my joke as terribad :P
I love the puns on the show.
I'm totally wearing my "Phillies" T-shirt when I go to my first meetup, just so I can joke about it.
oh. yeah it was eh. but i love the shows puns. but the title drop in sentences hurts sometimes
example: You're not getting the lesson 'my little ponies'
Aw, I like the title drops, I think it's cute. :P
maybe im just a dumb colt like that
lol
Haha, nah, to each his own.
Just because people have different tastes doesn't mean either side is wrong for it. :P
you're right :3 well g2g. be back later. got to get to morning class. luckily i only have one class on fridays. im a college freshman
Later, RadicalEdward2 :)
I'm done with classes for the day, just need a nap before BMN
kk. we bye bye pinkie pie :D
Whoa. Hello everypony.
First time seeing this many people here this early...
dayum, almost 50 and still this is the morning
Ohay WhatPayne
Hello. And I know, right?
yeah, WP
Yeah, 12 hours left until BMN, more than a day left until S2 premiere
I get the feeling this BMN will break some records...
Nah, why would it?
25:30 'til S2 premiere
I mean
Could this be the BMN with over 300 Bronies?
Hopefully it won't break any servers
Yeah, hopefully
it's not like it will be followed by an entirely new episode from the entirely new season...
...
...wait.
I wouldn't be surprised if we get more than half a thousand viewers.
indeed
It's not like there will be a full Season 1 marathon followed by the S2 premiere...
I just hope i can stay alive until then
Can't complain about Blade Runner either, really...
it's 13:23 here
It's not like they already yesterday posted the "flier" of this weekend's events
Someone will have to start the MAGNETO call in the Gala episode
yeah that too RP
...to be honest, I've never saw BR.
12 hours 'til Blade RUnner
Saw it once. Was pretty meh...
Into the gala metal things,into the gala have some magnets~
XD
Well it's not as good as the book
Nothing ever is
but still very good, I thought
Takuanuva, that movie is awesome. One of the best hard Sci-Fi movies.
Must not forget the magnets
So RobotPinkie, how you doing?
I don't say it isn't good
At the MAGNETO!!!
The best sci-fi movie of course is Brazil :P
RobotPinkie: Best Sci-Fi movie is 2001.
Ugh no it is not
If only because of how great it was for the time it came out.
Best sci-fi movie of course is Lost in Space, the 2000 or something remake
You know what im looking forward to? Seeing the pre Gen4 MLP movie.I hope it's the same one as what ObscurusLupa reviewed on TGWTG
^^
And I'm doing alright, WhatPayne, how u?
Pretty fine actually. Just got depressed when I read todays news...
Andrevus: did the movie he review have the Smooze?
i think it had.And it's a she
So it is the same movie.
Also: Best sci-fi movie is Highlander 2
Anyone plays "Osu!" ?
What news, WhatPayne?
Best Sci-Fi movie is Robowar
Nah, the best sci-fi movie is The Man Who Saves The World
If I'm serious though, I think my favorite sci-fi is Forbidden Planet.
Um. Nothing particular in the news. Just that in the past six months or so the news have been filled with pending crash of the European Union.
I realize it's not in the same class as 2001, but I enjoy it more.
Takes freaking long enough
I'm trying not to worry about the economy too much...
I'd like to read some different, happy news for change.
Rainbow Dash always comes to save you right before you hit the ground.
Still sticking to my 2001 as best movie. Why? Because it was the novelty of the thing. No sound in space, it has a feel of grandeur and majesty that most modern sci-fi movies don't have anymore.
Yeah. I mean there is nothing one can do from the bottom when it come to economy when even the people at the top cant always do something.
I agree, Dermathil, and it's probably in my top 10 movies of all time. I just have a very strong nostalgic attachment to Forbidden Planet :P
http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2270/1963789531_f6942837d6_o.jpg <-- Now that's a clue bat.
when does stream start
Did you guys know Princess Luna likes to play Taiko? XD
Hat, in 12 hours.
That's Dokkuro-chan, isn't it?
ty
Magneto will be at the gala too?
RobotPinkie: Yes.
Don't hate me but my favorite Sci-Fi movie is District 9.
We hope, EspyLacopa
It's been a while since I watched that.
And her club, Excalibolg.
my fav sci fi is Moon
Nevr seen D9, WhatPayne.
MOON!!!
It was pretty damn funny, I think
Moon is my second best favorite
It is in my top 10 sci-fi movies
She's ranked #25 in my country as a top player
Clint Mansell did such a great score for that movie.
District 9 divides people. Some absolutely hate it and some love it.
I need to watch it
I imagine I'll love it
same
Which?
Same goes with MLP:FiM some people (us) love it some people hate it
D9?
Though I also imagine that the moon is made of cheese, so...
Yeah, WhatPayne
D9 changed a bit halfway through
Right. Word of advice. Don't go watching it expecting anything.
I-ma-gi-naaaaa-tion
i like the action though
Someone has to put Moon as a B movie someday.
Keep open mind.
I don't really expect anything, except that it has something to do with aliens. :P
Oh god that movie.The Biology teacher warned us about that one
Moon as B movie?
That's the spirit RobotPinkie
it had bad moonrover effects but they weren't terrible
Well it had a small budget, and wasn'T very manestream, so it would fit B
might even sneak luna in on a special directors cut
Only problem with moon was that the dust did not behave correctly in the vacuum
...of the moon.
So... Eraserhead would definitely be B-movie
Source Code was good too, same director
It's a cult classic, AND it had virtually zero budget
Starship troopers would probably be up there with my favorite Sci-Fi movies...
omc
Oh man, that comic on EqD...
And Aliens
Starship Troopers seems like a movie MADE to be bad
WhatPayne, you missed Starship Troopers back in June, then
No I did not.
I was here.
you were there back then?
Darn, I didn'T think you were around that early
lol I love Starship Troopers
Yeah. I've been here since sometime may.
I know it's over the top and silly, but that's the charm
Not 24-7 but for the BMN's
And don't sweat about it. You can't always remember everypony.
Oh and which comic RobotPinkie?
The bug hunt one.
dayum, means you've been around for as long as I have, WhatPayne.
I guess it's an alternate theory to how S2 might start :P
Few can say they have
I guess I have been :P
its strange how they are airing part 1 twice consecutively
But it was sometime August when I started come here daily.
Quick question, will the stream start at the same time it always does, or will it start earlier due to the marathon
?
Same time as usual Rodman
/me meows at Luna
That comic makes no sense...
:o
LUNA!
07hello people :)
LUNAAAAAAAAAAAA
ohai Luna
gonna stream early today?
What doesn't make sense? It's just like normal, except... uh.... with Derpy.... and Aliens reference...
Hrmmm.... Anything streaming right now?
I think not, Suffuri.
But it was so out of character.
Unless Luna starts to show House MD and the IT Crowd this early in the day
Anyone know if you can watch the stream on an iPad?
Trying to test that out but can't without anything streaming.
No show streams this week, I don't think
Say Luna. Will you start streaming House again next week?
/me struts
...
07not sure yet, we will see :)
Oh okay. Thanks.
why isn't bronystate an international TV channel by now?
Good question.
Mr.Hat
/me tips
Alright, well I'm gonna get some sleep in now.
:D getting ready for tonight?
Yup
I just woke up two hours ago
See you around, everypony <3
Sleep well

The sexiest reading of a meal ever.
uh oh getting to tongue bits
ahhahaa
best fanfic reading ever
is it clopfiction if its with muffins?
I don't think so.
XD
I think its just a really awkward way of saying she ate a muffin
the ending... :D
off to classes
Muffins?!
This... has to be shared
share it with all
and enjoy the responses
anyway, the actual reason i logged on (being my first actually)... is will bronystate stream work on the PS3?
it might be possible to use a laptop's wireless link with a lecture room projector to broadcast this
well, its for my lounge. and some bronies and I wanna watch it together. Though I suppose I could plug my PC into the TV
Dammit. I accidentally cut off the power to my modem.
i don't have a PS3 however you could test it in the pre-show
Who's doing the preshow?
yeah, a test would be great.
also, is the countdown accurate? Cos my viewing it'll be at 3pm GMT
or my GMT is +2
07The mobile stream will only be up for the Season 2 premier
countdown seems bugged, at least for me
07Mane - Show starts at 7 PM Eastern
Where is the countdown?
http://www.ponycountdown.com/
btw
40 minutes until exactly 24 hours
^
Sounds about right to me.

Luna will you be doing the preshow?
07Most likely WhatPayne

what server is this chat under?
best picture ever
PonyChat.
BPE indeed
Content Warning A Disturbing Lack of G4 Ponies
lololololol
Watch out for the smooze!
But there is a lottery drawn? what by who where etc
PonyChat is the name of the room, but its not the name of the server, is it?
I'm trying to open this chat using Mirc, and I'm a bit of a noob
The room is #BronyState
so i need to search for it manually?
Hi there fellow bronies. Mind helping me out, how long till the first show starts? Or what time does the show start for +8 GMT?
...search for it?
uuuuuuuuh
Hi guys?
Just type it in for a new server. irc.ponychat.net
Heck, if you're already on mIRC, connected to another server, just type in: /newserver irc.ponychat.net
http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6961/poniesponieseverywheres.jpg
so.....
...hi?
hi!
@boomer, what exactly do you want to know the start of?
YAR!
there will be two movies, then the whole of season one, and then s2e1
...so, ummmm......
Blade Runner
what should I say?
About what?
In this chat?
8AM then
no wait
i can do this
We talk about ponies in this chat.
Twilight Sparkle is best pony.
5AM
And Season 2 Spoilers = hit with ban hammer.
that's it
ah
"it said 'newserver' is an unknown command
so...
when's season 2 again?
how aboooooooooooooout.."Hay guys what's going on in this chat box?"
in GMT?
5am then? Okie dokey then, thanks for the help Lupal. @amahran +8 GMT
twilight and luna are best ponies
LOL
8 GMT, okay then...
and it will be streamed here, right?
the actual s2e1 you mean? thats 1400 GMT
Do a google search for mIRC slash commands.
i thought the commans would all be the saem for every IRC client
LupalFillyus: Check the link in the channel topic. 1300 GMT.

MFW?
My Face When
hey dari, facny seein you
Just me or SF dead again?
well, it didnt help that it was out of commission for about a week
it has just been neglected by the admin
I mean I can't load up the site, would have told SR, but I don't think he's on.
Just AFK
I may be looking for a Skylanders forum, when one one eventually is created
suprised there hasnt been on yet. I havent found one though
Ah, so I take it you're anticipating it then?
I'm pretty disappointed by it.
I'll be buying the game, yes
9hey dari
Yeah DCD?
9...what's SF?
I dont know why anyone would be dissapoint... its just a game
1 minute and 24 hours to go
It's a forum.
THE GAME
if a pony game was made for console, people would eat it up, no matter how bad it is, lol
24 hours to go
Skylander as in the Spyro game?
yes
he negative response to it is sickening to me
I'm disappointed because it feels as though my favourite childhood game is being shat on again and again.
Cool. I've played the Legends trilogy, that was nice.
07Just curious
people need to get a life if they can spend that much time on the internet complaining about a game that isnt even out yet
07How many Euo-ponies are online atm?
07euro*
I am!
^
Night everypony, its 1 AM for me
The new one, errr, I've expected it to be better. But its Spyro, so what the heck. I still love him!
07Night Mauran
prince, that seems to be everyone's assessment
and i can understand that
but yall need to get over it, lol
Look at the bright side though, an official Spyro figurine
today's video game market is always gonna go towards the next generation, not the people who 'remember the old games'
I'm not gunna bash people for liking it, but I'm fed up of people calling me a 'hater', saying 'you're not a true Spyro fan' and other bullshit like that just because I don't like the look of this new game.
no, i dont buy into that either
if you dont like it, you dont like it
just stop complaining about it, lol
mr hat is gona already
damn
Hello
not talking to you, just in general
Yeah, I understand.
Well, only 23 hours and 58 minutes until Season 2
i remmeber when i played the originals when they came out. Most of the joy was built into the anticipation of playing them, not the game itself
so it doesnt suprise me too much that Spyro fans tend to judge the game before playing it
That post has a Majora's Mask theme
The EqD post
MFW EQD broke my script somehow.
lol
Nothing's gone wrong with it for weeks.
Now suddenly this.
<_<
*shrugs*
lol
hmm...
9dari, what script?
My EQD script.
i loved my childhood memeories, and I can always go back to them thanks to youtube and nes emulators
9ah
9I was worried for a second there
but as far as the rest of my entertainment, I always willing to try new things
Whyyyy, invalid passwordddd
Neh
Meh*
which is entirely how i became a brony
You could also use the Wii Virtual Console
I think
Wii? I'd rather not, lol
jus curious, prince. you mind telling me how old you are?
My Little Alicorn: return of the Alfalfa Monster!
I trust her opinion enough that I was willing to give it a change without any preconceptions.
that's important
I'm 16, birthday's July 6th.
too many people click links wit the prenotioin that its a stupid cartoon
9he's 16, and also a genius when it comes to coding
ah, see im 25, and I blame the Skyander's fued on the fact that older fans seem to be able to pass changes better because they've already seen their childhood stufs smashed to pieces arleady
so they can deal with it better, lol
speaking of which, I still cant figure out how to get here using mirc
I find no server called ponychat
With mIRC just type /server irc.ponychat.net
0because its not on mirc by default.
In the text box
Then /join #bronystate
ok, i tried newserver command cuz someone told me it would work
Thus I Came
Or type /server irc.ponychat.net -j #bronystate
9hey guys I think I'll stream some bootfighter once this download of mine is done
0thats what she said. :|
To be fair, I haven't used mIRC in ages.
Indeed
I think Spyro was a game that was doomed to failure as soon as its original developers no longer wanted it.
0most of the time id refrain from stupid childish jokes like that. (if you can even call it a joke) but right now im too bored to care.
hazah!
true Barry
0i believe the line is Huzzah!
11Well its 1114pm here so I'm Tired as ever
the problem liesw with people having a problem with future developers trying to push Spyro in the ground
07Get some sleep DerpDeDerps
and while the later games arent as good, I dont like to throw the baby out with the bathwater
the LoS was 'that' bad
Insomniac didn't dump Spyro.
They never owned it.
i know
15I mustn't For the Ponies.
That was aimed at Barry.
but they stopped making their game
has this spyro discussion been really going on for around 12 hours?
...No?
sorry guys, I'm back...
Okay now is my Colours o?
*Off
0just about every game nowadays is mind numbing. no thinking, no skill, just run into the wall till it gives way.
unfortnautely, the Spyro fandom is at it's all time lowest morale. I'm hoping Skylanders is a good enough game for people to enjoy him again
i left with people talking about it i think.. then i come back to people talking about it
0and thats what bothers me.
sorry, its just two of us talking purple dragons, lol
Purples Dragons are Best Dragons
"can't sleep.. talking about spyro"
Hopefully, Skyward Sword will be the diamond in the rough of gaming
We can hope.
0then again even the games i heard were "hard" were still not much of a problem.
Like what?
0anypony ever play the megaman zero games?
Nope
0ever play megaman x?
i never played megaman games
Does a Mustered count?
0no, mustered does not count.
I now see that I quoted that Wrong :P
0its hard to give a good example for what megaman x/zero games play like.
I think you meant the condiment mustard.
They I do Believe so
*I Believe so
Damn it lack of Sleep You Win Again!
yep
it always does
07Poor thing
Hi Luna!!
07Hello Barry
>mfw Cereal Velocity posted something called "Dawn of The Final Day"
Saw that :P
0i cant think of any games that were hard besides i wanna be the guy.
the: Wasn't demons souls hard?
"In 24 Hours that Moon will Screw us over"
0never played it. i dont think i even have the platform for that
me neither, but I heard it was very hard
what if they've been playing us this whole time with spoilers and junk
and it turns out they air a rerun
?
Hub be trollin
nah, impossible.
Them Hubs they done lied to us!
ok ok, not possible
Can't speak about it here though.
Or They exploded.... TWICE
spoilers are insta-permaban here.
Right so
Dem red kites be flyin' over my house.
anyway, it seems like they arent gonna continue with episode 3 after this. I guess they wont air episode 3 until late October
0i think the word for that is a reploding.
Damn Dirty Red Kites!!!
But red kites are cool. :<
INB4 people thinking I actually mean a red coloured kite.
They Kill my whole family....
*Killed
0most games i find to be pretty lame by design. like pokemon. now, i know alot of ponies like it.
0but the way i base a game is how well they let skill give you the win over how long you have been playing.
Pokemon has some rather odd ones....
squirtle squirtle
Pokemon blue, you can't knock it.
0monster level 50 vs your level 20? sorry, but no matter how good you are. you have no way to possibly win.
:P
Aw god damn it
Like a Washing machine....
0that seems lame to me.
the: Lawl, a level 20 can easily kill a lvl 50
A lvl 20 can easily kill a lvl 100.
FlameTard GO!
my lvl 10 Spyro could kill anypony
0but games that say, you have no upgrades? well, i guess you COULD win on this huge monster....but only if you have some real skill to fight back with.
Take it Easy son now!
i wish they had pony characters in Skylanders. that would be schweet
the: Pokemon is more about tactic than realtime 'skill'
Different kind of games bro.
0i feel that skill should take priority over level.
0pokemon isnt really tactics.
Well, you only need tactics if you play pokemon competitively I suppose.
And it is.
0its a strategy game
>tactic
i never liked Pokemon, honestly
>strategy
Same thing.
0no. no they are not.
I disagree.
:P
0strategy is where you plan out the fight, i send this move out, do x dmg, take y dmg finish it with o
0they send out monster 2 use attack does x dmg and my monster one will likely die.
I've always wondered,How they can talk perfectly Fine while in the Sea...
0a tactic is something you can adapt and change at any time.
0they are very good swimmers.
Well played...Well Played indeed...
0strong enough swimmers to fight off the pokemon in the water with them
Yeah, pokemon you can plan in advance, but there's realtime changes as well.
Indeed
8okay...how much time do we exactly have before the stream starts?
Bai
lol
Silly Person Colors are For Mods!
24 hours remain.
Interesting.
07Wrong
0723:28 :P
Well EQD got it wrong.
:P
Dat Moon Will Screw us over soon...
"one more day until social life ends" lol
wellll.............
Hello?
how is that wrong?
0the moon never stopped me.
How much more time left?
0i didnt like the moon time limit. so i glitch the game
23 and a half
07ticktockticktock
No in the Video :P
0i let the moon hit, but was out of sync for the milisecond of impact cutscene.
ah
0everypony died. besides me of course
it said it would be on at 7et right?
3 days....3 DAYS....
0then i went on to save the world.
so... 11 and a half?
0everypony left alive lived well.
0that being me.
0i guess im not much of a hero.
Then we all had Cake.
the cake is a lie
0there is only neurotoxins
River is A SPAIH

To get in some testing before we the show actually starts.
It isn't aired at 13PM EST like previous year?
0new chat system?
so...the movie involves the G1 MLP?
G1 is Better than G 3.5... UGH
Yeah.

Pontang: That's what all the channels were for. ;)
0details please.
I was ready to watch tonight :(
Ah
aaaand....is the G1 good or bad?
You'll see.

=3
9the movie itself is said to be entertaining
well, G1 was the stuff that inspired G4
yeah, the movie is okay.
0is it the other pony server?
fat bot is the same as driver fat XD
Hey Dari, I don't know if this is for everyone as well, but on my screen the imageshcak domain logo is present on the top right of the stream
No, we're staying on this network.
0alright good.
G 1 Deemable compared to Er "Other"
9Rodman, refresh
9you don't get the watermark?
0because i quit the other server after purist took the name i had and gave it to another user. -_-
So now they air it Saturday morning, lame :(
I don't care as long as it's not G 3.5

Indeed
Anon, just close the page, open again and rejoin chat
I really do not like Mio very much. I remember her singing the opening to Aura Battler Dunbine, didn't like it either. I did love the ending, "Byston Well".
Aww yeah, TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN ACTION
GO DAI-GURREN
Changing name is "/nick name", though it might be turned off by now.
what is this game?
I Swear that Clock will Explode at the Start of S2
Super Robot Wars Z2, Happy-Kah
Happy-Kah, Super Robot Wars Z2
Meh, Dunbine was depressing.
NINJA'D!

Lol Princess Luna is ranked #23 among Hungarian Taiko players WAT
You're supposed to say Jinx.
GO DAI-GUARD

9SIMON VERSUS GETTER G DRAGON
I'm familiar with the kana, but I haven't really studied much kanji in the past year.
9LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
GO SIMON!!!!!
GO SIMON!!!
Super shades are go
I'm on the same level as a 3rd grader or something... so it's not exactly all that impressive
i had to clear out the cookies from bronystate.
GO DAI-GUARD
who's staying up all night?
/me shall try
I'm going to attempt to stay up all night
I shall
Can't promise anything :P
Can one do anything less?
if i can stay up all night for no reason, i can stay up all night for Ponies
9wow Amuro
I'm prolly not gonna do an all-nighter. On Saturday I gotta help move crates after the S2 streaming
I have to stay up all night.
9how the fuck did you get hit?
The RX-93 is boring, give me hi nu. >=O
Too much shit to do.
9the enemy had 14% Hit Chance

LUNA BANISHMENT PUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0claiming that followup and spiking is BS and im cheating -_-
9we....
9MOON BANISHMENT PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH
mooooooooooooooooooooooon
oh right. Not luna, but moon.
TO THE MOOOOOON!
9Fun Fact: That mech is called the SOLAR Aquarion
hehehehehe yeah
Celestia's mech
She banishes to the moon, not luna.
Sunstroke Star, the evil mare in the Sun.
what game is streaming?
Super Robot Wars Z2
do area attacks exist in this game?
9yeah, they do
9frankly they're not too practical most of the time
Dai-Guard time?
9"Gundam and Ganmen...Why so much Gan Gun Gan?!"
=| No 7 a.m. post on ED.
soon...
Gan means face in jap
It's Popo's mech!
so yeah
9"Help meeeeeeeeeeee!!"
I think Gundam was originally supposed to be Gundom (Gun Freedom or something). Essentially, it's supposed to be 'cool' since it's directed towards children (Year, I wonder how the hell that worked with Zeta Gundam anyway...)
LUNA
9Luna! Prepare the Sol Graviton Crusher Punch!
damn that robot is fabulous
9naw it was always meant to be Gundam
9because a Gun with the stopping power of a Dam
They changed it to dam. =3
But is it piloted by the FAAAbulous Ginga Bishounen?
/me quits his no-pony fast early
dat jetpack
The Yatate team combined the English word "gun" with the last syllable of the word "freedom" to form the name Gundom.
/me 0doesn't like some of the rules for the server, but sees why they are there.
Bunny-mech, go!
/me notices that the had to manually click on the white color.
9Bunny? More like Dreadlocks
(due to the /me not being reddis)
uwaaaaaaaa
*reddish
where is Dai-Guard?
he didn't attack?
0wait, if i use a /me command i need to edit the color? XP
9Rainbow Dash would totally pilot this
nah
9becaus the Brasta is so fast ;W;
/me certainly doesn't.
indeed, NewDCD
9and the Spigot, it is a Rainboom
dodge
the: nah, it just suggests that you tried another color but had to change back
9ohai Ledouche
0oh wow, this is lame. its been 4 hours in game with my sign up saying im joining a MLP FiM guild and i have gotten no replies yet :|
Well, atleast Code Geass had Flow.
=s
Hm? Which game?
i just hopped on
Dat Colors
9yeah
9that song is still sexy as fuck
FLOW = awesome
9DAT EVIL LAUGH
0maplestory. the game with the worst moderators ever
it's not his day
i didnt know a game for this was out
Flower was awesome
0its basicly the worst run game ever.
why does it say rainbow dash is the best pony when she is certanly not :)
9Crowe Broust says: "Ammo conservation? What's that?"
I really liked the opening and ending songs for the first season of Spice and Wolf
mmm, apples
wow, he really went to town on that guy
Clearly Pinkie Pie is best pony.
yes
:P
It's time somthing was made there
0rainbow is the best pony
apple jack is my fav
I love all the Mane 6 so much, though
9"CHECK!"
There is a difference between "favorite pony" and "best" pony'
pfft how can flying beat teleporting and destorting reallity?
0hey, can you keep a secret?
http://images.4chan.org/a/src/1316181841297.png <-- *snerk*
Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are my favorite ponies
9Pon, C.C. does all of the pilotan I think
my favourtie are pinkie and rainbow
Yeah
same, but pinkie is "best"
but Rarity is indisputably best pony
9also his "Tactical Command" Menu is BOSS
But he shouldn't be in there.
Meh
0dont tell anypony, but the secret is *whispers* i have a crush on rainbowdash *endwhisper*
No way, Rainbow is best pony
9Kallen, Burai, Jewgi, Tanuki and Todoh are pilots as well
never!
Pretty sure people are just kidding when they say "best pony"
*GAAAAAAASSP*
9oh also Spinzaku, but he joins you only for a short while
I don't think anyone mean "objectively best"
0Shhhh!
Every pony is best pony
SNIPING TIME
9also
9this game:
BOOM HEADSHOT
=3
9REALITY DISTORTIONS UP THE ASS
the game! noooo
wait
MISSED SUCKA
there we go
Now you hit him
HEADSHOT
in the body
Whoa, that's long range
;x
Aquarion special thingie?
PUNCH HIM TO THE MOON!
9man I should watch Legend of the Galactic Heroes
9but it's so long
NewDCD: it's amazing. :D
Rarity, works the harderst, she the most mature, and the most creative. She is the only one of the ponies to have created and run her own business.
Yang Wenri is my favorite character evar.
NwDCD, my exact problem with One Piece
:>
applejack maybe didnt create it but she works very hard
wow you are just kicking so much ermmmm butt
omg
9enemies fighting enemies
9cool
She works hardest during harvest. Rarity works that hard all year round.
lol, the skull thing looks soooo cool
9man those Ganmen are FUCKED
And Rarity sings
0rainbowdash needs more solos.
pinkie sings
Essentially, LOGH was probably an inspiration to the likes of Death Note/Code Geass.
nope, fluttershy is just a lazy loner
Not to mention Rarity's biggest fan is a GODDAMN DRAGON
true, rainbow's solo at the gala was awesome
a baby dragon
And she rescued herself when she got kidnapped.
A GODDAMN BABY DRAGON
>mfw chat turned white and blue for the first time for me
well pinkie was a pet alligator
through being a bitch...
he has no teeth:3
Pfft, Fluttershy has a full grown dragon wrapped around her finger, SilkAMV :P
pinkie WAS?
wait..
wait
sorry
It's Pinkie Pie.
but who knows, maybe she was
You never know with that party pony
Before or after she made equestria?
i mean she did create Equestria just by looking at a rainbow and having a party
pinkie can distort reallity
lol
Silk: Both.
After, I think
What the heck are we looking at?
That's just how Pinkie Pie rolls
I'll go play some TF2 to pass time
Pinkie Pie invented parties.
See you guys later
Stonegaze: SRW Z2
Indeed
didn't SilkAMV work on ANthology?
She's just that awesome.
See ya, Rodman
pinkie pie einvented everything... including celestia
Yus, that is me
O____O
@Dermathil The-what-now?
9Pinkie Pie built Mazinger Z
Who invented who first, Celestia or Pinkie Pie?
did you spoil season 2 for yourself? just curious, i won't
Stonegaze: Super Robot Wars Z2. A massive game that is a crossover of all the robot animes
Pinkie Pie no yuutsu. ;x
i did... i couldnt control myself around season 2 content
Dermathil Ah, okay thanks.
this gmae is getting intence
yay back to black
Oh, you're the one who did the Pink Pony section, right?
Pinkie Pie is a dimension-distorting, reality-shifting party pony
alright guys, I'm leaving in about 10 minutes for class.
i had season 2 spoiled for me though thumbnails
It was unavoidable. I would have had to breaky myself away from the whole ponynet to avoid spoilers. It was a question of which would kill my soul worse. Spoilers, or avoiding ponies.

9ALL OF THE FUCKING ANIMATION BUDGET
9RIGHT HERE
Oh Amuro,. I no like you.
AVOIDING PONIES
I was going to wait until tonight to stop looking at ponies but I woke up too early today.
impossible
0iv basicly stopped watching anything pony related as well
i didnt see a single spoiler! *proudface*
I've gotten some very slight spoilers, but yeah, I'm NOT avoiding ponies.
=I
You sure, NewDCD? I am pretty sure that Gurren Lagann's combo took a big chunk of the animation budget too.
0to avoid s2 spoilers
Holy crap that was awesome!
Avoiding ponies is worse than death
somebody spoiled Discord for me cause i linked him AppleDash pic
ye
9Dermathil: it's a running joke on the SRW fan commmunity
Loran == Hayate
Only the overall premise for Episode 1-2 is spoiled for me.
=x
ooooooooh
hahahahaahah
<infoserv>
0pm me that appledash pic :|
<InfoServ>
grrr
Knowing that Discord exists is a bigger spoiler than what he looks like.
it's the one out of last night's drawfriend
hey guys, don't forget that spoilers= insta-permaban here
why do u ppl like appledash?
thats f***ed up
i like AppleDash
Who are playing this game?
<3333
i LOVE TwiDAsh
appledash?
Cause they had a tiff in Fall Weather friends
i fucking love TwiDash
Stonegaze: NewDCD is playing
I like 90% of shipping >.>
0wait, you mean the kissy one?
nah, the best ship is pinkie X gummy
wtf?! dash isnt gay...
http://www.rrr.org.au/assets/gigantor_tetsujin_28go-thumb-550x393-24903.jpg <-- Is this guy in Super Robot Wars?
9like the quality, buster?
Ah.
But only the creators of the show know about Season 2, so there's nothing to worry about.
People love de-angries
i've read 80+ lesbian ship fics
I'm just a romantic.
yay
9Espy: not to my knowledge, but Giant Robot is
clarent, dear god...
Twixie's my preference.
0dash is shipped with everypony and everything.
i knows...
Only ones I don't like incest ships
the nest big ship
GO DAI-GURREN
dash adn that one tree
(And other problematic ones)
incest ships......
?
There are people who ship AppleMac and Princest
GO DAI-GUARD
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
well.... i'm working on shipping Fluttershy and Bloomberg
I don't really read shipping, unless it's peripheral or parody
0which tree? fluttershy?
9BA BA BA BAAAAAA
YES
Hopefully the mods will create a #tab where spoiler can be accidentally said.
9BA BA BA BAAA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
Too much info!
BA BA BA BABABABABABABABBABA
Tovler: You can make your own.
Like #ponyspoilers
I'm a fan of everypony-mac personally
I like Fluttermac
and talk to myself like a crazy person.
i don't like straight shipping. <.<
i dun know why
9BIG O!
9SHOW TIME!
Not because I'm opposed to lesbian Fluttershy, but because they're just such a cute couple
BIG O TIME
because your a heterosexual guy
wtf is wrong with u ppl
0i read one where fluttershy groomed dash's wings.
Dat lip sync
pony porn?
0and made her POMF hard.
you're talking to someone who was a bisexual furry a year ago
0no, no sexytime.
Pinkie_Pie2: Who said anything about porn?
We're talking about shipping.
0just shipping
I don't read ship-fics. Well, I don't read fics that much but I did like The Night After.
still, pony lesbians?
So?
yay
AWW YEAH GO CROWE
9My Little SRW: Teamwork is SPIRALPOWER
i dont like clop-fics
0i do :|
NewDCD: epic victory
i love clop-fics, i just don't clop
90% of the developed characters in the show are female.
wtf
0as long as it includes dash.
Of course we'll have lesbian ships.
i clopped to ponies once, i was ready to kill myself
Closest thing I read to a ship was "Of Two Minds" where Twilight got stuck in Trixie's body.
sure we can have, but not like them
0dash is pretty.
thats just effed up
Was pretty interesting.
Dash is beautiful
What's so wrong about that?
is derpy hooves a he or she?
She.
Pinkie, just go read lesbian ship fics.
/me prefers calling her Ditzy Doo or Bright Eyes.
no!
i was gonna say man or woman, but she is neither
you might understand...
lol
i like te cupcakes tho
Eugh.
I much prefer Derpy Hooves.
hey guys, just wondering, who has seen that picture of filly pie eating her tail?
how did we go from giant robots to shipping?
Yeah cupcakes entertained me.
This baffles me
0i liked the idea of cupcakes.
But it didn't ruin pinkie for me
Derpy seems kinda mean for an actual name.
hello
0but i didnt like the idea of dash being in cupcakes.
oh god, who said one of the forbidden fics?
pinkie can be ruined :D
cant*
i've never read Cupcakes
Cupcakes is like a separate canon in my head that has nothing to do with real ponies.
never plan to
read it
I haven't read Cupcakes and I don't intend to in the near future.
its good
0"one" of the forbidden fics?
9BURESTO FAIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
0there are others?
BREAST FIRE!!!!!!!!!!
I will never read cupcakes
For Grimdark horror, I prefered the one where Rarity went completely off the deep end.
read cupcakes, just dont make it mess up pinkie
0nightmare to remember?
The one where she made the perfect stallion.
Anyone ever eat schadenfraude pie?
OH SNAP
REINFORCEMENTS
Grimdark Rarity? Do want. Can has?
was that guy who died an ant eater?
O NOES, more
If you read cupcakes, you will lose any grain of sanity left in your soul
SilkAMV: Let me find it again
Ooh man, shit just got real!
i can't read any of this :'(
DAYUM
oh snap
lololol
eyup
AWW SHEEEET
it just steped up a notch
oh no
i read cupcakes.. it was really not plausible so i really didn't get affected by it.. if you really think it's possible you probably have problems of your own.. just saying
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOOO
OOH SNAP
Rainbow-Dash, i laughed the offended page, will cupcakes affect me?
ONE OF THE FOUR GENERALS
Someone is drawing a comic of cupcakes. He's up to the part where Rainbow Dash wakes up.
That's the general witht he flying fortress, right?
yes espylacopa
9FUCKING ASSIMILATIOOOOOOOOOOON
...how can anypony draw that?
UPGRADE
AWW YEAH
ASSIMILATIONS
9GURREN LAGANN CAN FLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Dunno, it didnt affect me, but its still really.. Disturbing, if you think about the little details, that is.
wait... waht
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Ah, yes. Prince Charming: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-prince-charming.html (Warning, this is one scary grimdark)
cupcakes is ok, maybe even good, but its not excelent
YES
i thought this was code
YES
YES
This scene will go down in history!
ULTRA COMBO
ya i was smiling through it until about half-way.. then it was just kinda uncool
The only disturbing thing about that fic was the grammar, at the time I read it.
WHAT GAME IS THIS?!?
sweet
Who the hell do you think I am!!!???
Clarent: SUPER ROBOT WARS Z2
Clarent Super Robot Wars
The grammar WAS atrocious, though, so... English majors beware
I said it like 10 times already
imma try to beat Halo by the time season 1 stream starts.
http://whatever.scalzi.com/2006/09/26/how-to-make-a-schadenfreude-pie/ <-- Have some pie.
unless it's way early
when is the stream?
?
Wow, that's considered a challenge?
ALRIGHT GUYS, I'm leaving
wow this game jsut got 20% cooler since its a crossover game
What difficulty?
Cyall at the BMN!!!!!
bwahaha this rarity fic should be good
Take Care!!!

It's a shame Gundam X didn't get the full 50 episodes it was planned.
They really cut it too short.
9yeah
9but it still is one of the best series in the franchise
DCD: You guys going to set +N soon?
The last 10 episodes felt like the last 10 episodes of Ideon.
It's probably my favorite non-Tomino Gundam series.
Of course, it's 1. Victory, 2. Zeta, 3. Turn-A
9dat Chirico
AW Gundam X would be 4th
Oh Chirico, you so cool

0is the pony movie 3rd gen?
8.5
The movie is G1
8 hours and 20 minutes, about, I think
0or which gen is it?
It's the SMOOZE
Nothing can stop the SMOOZE
8 hours
?
i can beat Halo by then
0alright
right?
Is this pokemon?
I'm so happy with Bjornfot for picking that movie. omfg
How do you confuse pokemon with giant mech combat?
FreezwFrame Well in that case I'll be facing an all-nighter here in Spain.
Troll
Perfect way to start the S1 Marathon.
S1 marathon?
tonight?
Yes.
:O
Yup
Oh well, I can sleep on Sunday.

oh yeah how long till the marathon starts?
After the two movies.
07after movies :)
how do you confuse pokemon with lord of the rings?
Not sure, after the movies
kaaaaaaaay
thanks
Sleep can wait~
Bjornfot had the best trollpick ever.
9also Dari you here?
Yeah.
My brain is full of pony, and I love it
lol sleep if for noobs!
lol
9can you fix the HQ Popout?
Will they be live streaming Episode 1 of season 2 here? The channel that airs MLP in canada isn't airing season 2 until who knows when...
Justin: Yes.
07yes
9yes, we will be airing the episode live
The Movies starts at about 12:30 am, that's after midnight and the S1 will start around 2 a.m. FML
Thank you!
9at quality comparable to the game running now
Perfect
Freaking airman
What time does the episode air here on the east coast?
PUnch him to the moon!
9 AM EDT
I'm talking the time at CET (Central Europe Time.
if i was to sleep now, how long would i have before i should wake up?
9unlike Rock
9I CAN defeat Air Man
lol, i am sorry i am sure all these questions must be fustrating
Which is 3 PM CET
It's at 3PM CEST, Stonegaze
Stonegaze> could you tell me how many hours there is for that =D i kinna live in Europe so i wanna know when i need to be on =D
wow, nice video quality!
9oh wow the flight pack raised Gurren Lagann's armor to kingdom come
i am in ireland
It has Gurren Lagann too owO
Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland?
Baka-Neku I'm trying to do the math on the time variance between CEST and EDT.
is that a sword crotch?
The movies start today at 11 PM GMT, and the season 2 premiere airs at tomorrow at 1 PM GMT
It's at 2PM in Ireland, Happy-Kah
i know in my time season 2 starts at 3 pm tomorrow
That's 12p.m for me. Hurray
07Baka-Neku where you from?
oohhh that is awesome, thank you!
9HOLY SHIT THAT IS NEW
denmark =D
Nyst: This is why Gurren Lagann has the best mechas.
07ah :)
9...well holy shit.
i am in northern ireland but i am irish and british
Heh
i have both passports!
I am in Spain.
Well, yeah. Each of the four nations that makes up the United Kingdom of Great Britain is quite autonomous.
It would be funny if they put the IGPX mechs in the game just to get their asses kicked
i like to say i am irish tho,
and that's why you shouldn't say GMT, Espy, because now he thinks it starts an hour before it does :P
Stonegaze should't you have around the same time as me then?
Well I'm off for lunch. See you all at the movies.
I dunno
Because people forget that Brit time only coincides with GMT when it's not Summer Time
;p
Bah, that's their problem.
Well, see you all!
9Time for FRIENDSHIP CANNON
tomorrow gonna be loaded with people >_<
Ohai everyone
I say GMT, because it /is/ GMT.
Well, not just their problem if everyone sees it that way...
9Pony Version of the same attack: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/318120f0fcbcb8fe9688e1d67b9f16d1/17871%20-%20applejack%20attempt%20crossover%20rainbow_dash%20rarity%20super_robot_wars%20twilight_sparkle.png
i never understod GMT talk xD
neither have i
lol
GMT is also the name of a time zone, which is where the confusion lies.
9man, Simon
9hang in there
If it's 5 PM GMT, and you're timezone is GMT-5, then it's 5-5 PM in your timezone, thus Noon.
i know i live in -1 somthing somthing
Is that really a mech?
i live at +0 gmt
i think
lol
Gurren Laggan needs some healz
What throws people off is the abomination that is Daylight Savings.
9it's kay
9I think Simon has the Guts seishin
thought it looked like Getter Robo
When you set up your computer, you set your time zone as GMT relative. DST is not taken into account.
And you kinda have to keep Daylight Savings in mind. . .because there are large parts of the world that don't use it.
Not going to say anything more about it, people see GMT as UK time
even the half of the year that it isn't :P
So who likes ponies?
Actually, you set "automatically detect DST" as well
dam i have no idea about any of this, and i live in the uk!
lol
How have you been NewDCD?
RobotPinkie: No one in here.
Aw, I'm alone? :(
:P
only reason i know it's 3pm for me is i calculated the time on the countdown =D
I thought it was a given, since we're all here.
and yes, you do, FreezeFrame. :P
0can i request a vid to be streamed?
9pretty cool, thank ya kindly
Yes, I was being sarcastic
9King Gainer vs. the World
Well I meant you set "automatically set to DST" :P
GURREN HAX
Whether or not you like ponies, FreezeFrame, that I cannot say!
9time for your favorite attack
Hi.
Giga Drill Breaker!
i think some of you saw my thread on ponychan
about the surgery
well
it went through perfectly
/me did not, for he does not go to ponychan.
Morning everypony
Hi AllisZero

0this is awesome http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIfHKfyRO5Y
OMG 22h to S2 ><
Dude, 12 more damage and you could have killed that unit.
Rarity is my favorite pony
And my favorite ship is Rarijack
i recovered in 10. seconds. flat. (Just exxagerating. it took about a minute to fully recover.)
Q is my favorite pony?
9CHIRICO MANEUVERS
Damn, I suck at old school games.
My favorite ship is Twilestishy Diane Cake, still
9notasinglefuck.VOTOMS
The cake is a lie, RobotPinkie.
ADVENTURE TIME
Lol I thought he did that to the 12 damage robot
No the cake is ALIVE!
phew. Just read the Lauren Faust interview.
The cake is a DELICIOUS truth, if you've watched through the end credits, EspyLacopa!
the cake is a pie
Heh
Apparently, the new stream software stops if you go to a different tab?
the cake is pinky pie
lolol nice!
Or it was just a coincidence
i think coincidence
Soarin' x Pie is best ship
lol
mine works fine
Go Leeron.
lol, there is a guy called the and his name keeps linking in the text
s***, I forgot that Archer aired last night.
Wait RobotPinkie aren't you supposed to be napping?
Twixie ship is best ship
I did nap, WhatPayne
9Big O! Acccccccccccccction!
Cast in the name of god, ye not guilty
AppleShy <3
Oh... Had good nap?
2 hours of sweet, sweet sleep... actually I had a nightmare, but that's beside the point :P

0did it have black snooty in it?
Which was the series with the Goldion Hammer in it?
9GaoGaiGar
Well that's nice (not the nightmare part) but that you had good nap
You mean Hokey Smokes?
lol for me The is invisible..... his tekst is white and i have white bagground

Wow, the robots look much better now.
I hadn't noticed that lol
and now, i want pizza
I just had pizza yesterday.
sundenly, hunger
But let's have a pizza party to commemorate Season 2.
totally!
PIZZA DAAAAAAAAY!
Just finished a large pizza, good stuff.
I might have pizza tomorrow after S2 premiere
fffffffffffffffrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt.
lolol
i had a large pizza on tuesday,
i couldn't eat it all in one go
cold pizza <3
Send someone to the moon :3
Cold pizza is the best thing ever.
NewDCD, are you up for some BlazBlue later?
Pizza to commemorate Season 2? Hell, if this were a bar, drinks and food would be on me.
take them off!
9DAT DYNAMIC KILL
lol
I remember one restaurant I went to, they had a spinach pizza using ricotta cheese instead of the standard mozzeralla and tomato sauce.
It was delicious.
What kind of veggies, SilkAMV?
cool guys don't look, am i right?
it sounds good
Olives tomatoes and peppers
Isn't that Shinn? The whiny, partly sociopathic brat from Gundam Seed Destiny?
More veggies than cheese really
tho there was a lack of slow motion
They really piled it on
i don't like tomatoes but the other 2 are nice
9Yeah it's Shinn, only he's really cool in SRW
Aw, those are GOOD veggies though
9kind of how Shinji is actually pretty badass in Alpha
9IT'S ALL ABOUT POSITIVE INFLUENCE FROM CHARACTERS OF OTHER SERIES
Yeah, but they're all up in my pizza. Doesn't even taste like pizza anymore.
Aw, then it's not fun
9but yeah
YOu could do like Pinkie, and put candy corn on your pizza.
lol, tastes like a tomatoe and cheese toasty with veg
9SRW was a massive rewrite of SEED Destiny
I don't know what SRW or Alpha is. By Shinji do you mean SHinji Ikari?
9people actually called Kira and Assram on their bullshit, for one
9yeah
9SRW is a big series
9Super Robot Wars
Yes, he meens shinji ikari
Does anyone know when they will be airing season 2 live here EST? If nobody's sure, I have no problem leaving the room open the next day.
Filled with robots of every single mecha series.
Super Robot Wars: Massive crossover between a massive number of Mech Anime.
9 AM EAST
EST*
Thanks you
On Saturday 17th
I can't keep all these different gundam continuities straight . . .
I don't know if I can forgive Shinji for being such a pussy in Evangelion
23 HOURS LEFT.
9Shinji wasn't a pussy
9he was 14
9he was still a brat
RobotPinkie: Shinji is just like every other 80s mecha protagonist.
Yeah
*22*
9can't blame him for being scared of piloting a giant robot
He was a realistic character. Whether you like it or not.
9but in SRW
Evangelion is basically that, an 80s mecha made in the mid 90s.
0721:52 :)
No, but there was 0 character development. Not realistic
Now I get it. The spoiler ban is for right after the show airs.
Hey
9thanks to people like Kouji, Ryoma, Guy Shishiou....ect.
I still need to watch the End of Evangelion and the Rebuild Series of Evangelion.
9Shinji actually had positive role models
Granted, it's Evangelion was nothing special as people like to claim.
Everything happened all at once in the last episode, when it comes to character development. If you call that realistic, whoa boy.
awww this reminds me of a song
Man, the Rebuild kicks ass
9and decided to reject Instrumentality and basically told Gendo to go fuck himself
The rebuild series is actualy really good.
-it=s
9hell, Gendo ended up going SON I AM PROUD
I gotta play alpha eventualy.
9one of the Alpha games is translated
Here's an AMV I made of it in two hours http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG2-XY6jYIM
9Alpha Gaiden for the PSX
>_>;
brb downloading.
I love hiw Japanese voice actor
his*
Sebiale: same
Wait, isn't that the one with only bandai originals?
and "like every other 80
But I loved in Spice and Wolf.
He also did Death the Kid.
and "like every other 80's mecha protagonist", no
In Soul Eater.
Just... no...
wait
9naw you're thinking of OG
9DAT BEAM CONFUSE
No, it's the guy who did Light.
This battle seems pretty one-sided.
Lawl
Always get those two confused.
9I'm just that good
9Does this remind you of anything?
9RAINBOOM ATTACK
there is something very sexual about what just happened
i've got a question
lol
why is this show worth watching?
i tried watching the first ep but it wasn't very good
does it get better?
im talking about mlp
9which one?
yes
it does
i mean a lot of people are obsessed about it
Umm, can someone give me the time and timezone the first ep for S2 will air?
9well the first two eps aren't very indicative of the quality
Fukuyama Jun played Lawrence in Ookami to Koushinryou.
9 AM EDT (GMT-4)
9I'd recommend you to start with Ep 03 or 04
They did take a but to hit their stride
Tbh, I haven't heard him in anything else.
But the show makes me inexplicably happy doe some reason
Yes, watch the first 6 episodes or so, mib_g4xeru
okay
for*
thanks for the tip
Episode 4 did it for me, try that one
9and it's also not for everyone
Thanks Espy :)
9even if it's liked by a lot of people
9it's okay if it isn't your taste
hi
bEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAMU
are they free-standing?
or is there a big plot
Episode 5 was the one that made me realize I cared about the characters.
And it's currently 11:14 AM EDT.
mostly freestanding
DAWN OF THE FINAL DAY
Mostly yes.
Free-standing for the msot part
24 HOURS REMAIN
They're slightly intertwined
They mostly stand on their own, yup
9SCOOTALOO F. SEIEI
there is some overarching plot, but it's not essential
I never had a problem with ep 1/2. Not as good as the others yeah, but I never thought them bad.
Oh look, Setsuna . . .
as long as you watch the first ep first, and last ep last, you're good
lol, i can't find the video and we are completly off topic now
lol
Well, I love the first 2 episodes now...
so bleh!
9yeah I like the first two eps too
I swear it was 6 am in some timezones.
My only problem with the whole season is not enough Luna
I remember not liking the first two episodes. But now that I'm into the show I love them.
But it gets a lot better with more context
9but they are not a good starting point for everyone
i'll drink some beer and watch them
thanks and bye!
The first 2 are great in my opinion, they are fun to watch.
So it's EDT for sure?
Exactly, SilkAMV
17:15 here :D
hallo
Am I the only one who saw the animation error in episode 2 where it shows 6 elements of harmony on the pedestal on my first go?
shinji
Yes.
That stood out like a sore thumb.
No, there was a video about all the errors
but I've seen plenty that the video didn't point out
Some people just don't want to acknowledge the difference between GMT and BST.
Me too, SilkAMV
I didn't check the whole thing, though
It's 4:15 pm in GMT though...
I don't find errors because I don't look for them.
but they missed my favorite mistake... the double nostril
and apparently it's 11:15 EDT now
Yes, yes it is.
the first 2 eps were like totally serious and stuff and the rest were just like yay ponies!
I don't look for mistakes, I just happen to notice them, lawl
You /sure/ you're in GMT right now?
When you edit ponies they errors are hard not to notice
Do you observe Daylight Savings where you are?
Because GMT /never/ changes due to Daylight Savings.
Seriously, Espy, the time zone is called GMT, their current time is BST :P
9there's an easy way to keep track of the time
9http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/eastern-time/
9when it's 9 AM there
9it's time for the ep
time zones screw me up, and I university theoretical maths >.>
I can't believe so many ponies are gathered here already...
I love having no class on friday :D
9>ZakuPony
9you are already my very best freeeeen
OK!
But BST is GMT+1.
I shall set alarms :D
Friendship accepted
hmm.. anyone have the link to the pony countdown handy?

Haro
Haha, yeah it's pretty easy to remember once you see it
I like the random Rarity being dragged across the screen, too...
6Here is a Philosoraptor trivia for everypony. . .
6Why is Octavia's cutie mark a Treble clef, when the Cello is a Bass clef instrument?
Click on Celestia on RobotPinkie's link
Because she's pinkie's sister
Because Mexico?
omfg VioletVanilla
Whose to say that equestrian cello's follow the same rules?
cello isn't her favored instrument
Oh who the hell called himself "the"?
You just blew my mind
Maybe she got her CM from a different instrument, but had to play the double-cello-bass for the gala?
Click on Derpy
lol Derpy
lol, click on Twilight. . .
Planck time. . .
oh god and to think i thought she couldn't get any nerdier
9BYE BYE
Manly robot right there.
mecha*

Wow! This is AWESOME!
i like how these robots dodge
OMFG i was just watching then suddenly Rarity
wait, what link?
Ohlol
can you click on the traveling rarity?
...What is that thing that spike is holding up when you click on him?
Click on the sun
a qr code
<3
and then Luna links to some Luna inspired music.
How did that do less damage than Big O's goddamn punch?
Yes, yes, I realize that it's a code. But what does the code /mean/?
let me check
oh god click on the teacher Cherilee i think was it
9LET'S GO
It's a website code, isn't it?
9NIA WRIGHT: ACE SHIP CAPTAIN

Solarboy: You should see Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.
Click the parasprite, then click on Pinkie :P
Now there's a giant mech.
Yeah, I really need to.
LOL
lol so many easter eggs
ORE WO DARE DATTO OMOTE YAGARU!!!
Gotta catch up with fairy tail first though.
anime or manga?
JIBUN WO~!
dude Click Cherilee then Scootaloo
If you click the sun beside Celestia it tacks to a new page
Fairy Tail? Anime.
Oh god, or just keep clicking the parasprites.
boo
What is the name of this game?
lol
9Super Robot Wars Z2 (Break the World Chapter)
Super Robot Taisen Z hakai-hen
LOL
10
Is there translations?
9Amuro Ray ALWAYS FINISHES HIS ENEMIES IN STYLE
Cause I really want to play this.
9there are for a few games in the series
Don't think there are
9but this is the newest one so there isn't
There are no translations yet for this one.
I keep missing Rarity
dang
Hello, hello!
can you translate all of it?
or click Spitfire if you think it's taking too long for S2 to get here :P
Haha
9I just know to navigate themenus
lol
wait, who the hell is that pony in the back?
9because I learned with the games that have been fantranslated into English
sup
lol awesome
....
neat
I suddenly wonder what will happen when Spitfire's speedy countdown ends.
does this include robotech?
9it has Macross Frontier units
9so Sorta
sweet
9if you want Rick Hunter/Hikaru Ichijou
suü
9get Alpha Gaiden for the PSX
I've never liked how all the gundam series always have the main mech have a similar design
9it's been fantranslated and included Macross DYRL
this guy looks like the sleve of a brown and yellow jumper
I'm gonna try and see what happens, EspyLacopa
9TRANS-AM
I mean, it looks good, but it gets kinda boring
awesome
9SCOOTALOO F. SEIEI
9CUTTING THE WAY TO THE FUTURE!
I wonder why the main car in REDLINE is called the Transam?
look! you tell me that doesn't look like a sleve
9Because Japan loves Trans-Am
It's like... only an hour or so left of my Spitfire countdown
ohay ValtheJean
2,14 howdy
9This attack: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/8cf081064fbf91cfde15d50b9ca0c620/19727%20-%20gundam%20rainbow_dash%20super_robot_wars.png
2,14 lol DCD, did you shop that?
Awesome
9naw
9I just found it in Ponibooru
9someone apparently did a lot of Z2 Pony Attacks
2,14 ah, oh well
2,14 o rly?
9no Valks
I'mma go look for SRWZ translation
2,14 sadface.jpg
9if it existed
9I'd have it
2,14 lol
Nice, a lot of bronies here already!
9so far only Alpha Gaiden, SRW 1, SRW 3 and SRW J have been translated
Oh, this isn't a lot.
2,14 I looked up vids of (think it was called) Alpha...I squee'd at the SDF 1
9OG 1 and OG 2 were localized for the GBA
9and that's it
9it's enough to learn how to play though
We won't get A Lot until around 7 or so, when the movies start.
We'll probably hit around 200+ users then.
9yeah, Alpha Gaiden has the original Skull Squadron
Alpha 3 is my personal fav
2,14 so much want
Final move against the boss should be the Moon Punishment Punch
9I have something better planned
9...If Garrod decides to charge up
Final move: Taste the rainbow MF
wait how did he only take 10 damage
better than moon banishment?
9because I used a defensive Spirit Command
9yeah
What could be better than that?
9but he didn't decide to charge
2,14 wait? are you streaming now?
2,14 OMG MUST TURN ON MAI STREAM
2,14 I saw Big-O!!!!!
TIME TO TASTE THE PAINBOW!!!
9ah well
9time for PHOTON BEAM
2,14 you know, I used to be "meh" about Mazinger...but he's really started to grow on me
9of course he did
9he's the first Super Robot
2,14 I was wondering that....I had my suspicions
really now?
2,14 but since I'm not too fluent in super fighting robot lore I figured I wouldn't say anything :P
Thats awesome
9well if you don't count Tetsujin
9he's the first PILOTEABLE robot
Didn't expect to see SRW on here... I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
FUUUUUUUUUU-
Tetzujin is also in REDLINE. Suddenly I'm realizing how many references that movie has.
2,14 I must get this game...I want it....so badlt
2,14 badly* even
9OH SHIT THIS EVENT
Really? I watched Redline but didn't get that reference.
9http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/0c570ed967488396d9801da2e10217ec/18453%20-%20Getter_robo%20Sweetie_Belle%20apple_bloom%20comic%20mecha%20robot%20scootabeam%20scootaloo%20super_robot_wars.png
9THIS IS NOW IN FULL EFFECT
LordGenome?
He was the Machine Head racer
The redline champion
Hmm
2,14 heh...scootabeam....
9SCOOTA BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
is his name Ryoma or something?
SSSSWWWWEEEEEETTTT!
9YES
9His name is Ryoma
yup
/me 2,14 wants to see Big-O smash someone :P
This game is so delightfully over the top.
YEAH!
GURREN LAGGAN!
My Japanese isn't all that good, and I don't remember much of Getter Robo
2,14 YES
It's funny how Dai-gurren is too epic for this game
2,14 BIG-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU COMBINE THE MOST HOT-BLOODED SHOWS IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!
Now imagine if Kamina was in this.
He is.
9he was
2,14 I have no idea how this universe is stable
He was
But Kamina died
9he just died already
Forever.
TO bad this game doesn't have vs mode
2,14 no universe could possibly be this awesome and not explode on itself
But avenged himself
No he didn't :'(
9Val, there is Equestria
This universe runs on the power of Awesome.
2,14 ah, good point :P
9now if we gave Equestria mechs....
So, allow me to ask.
Why the SRW?
9FIN FUNNEL RAPE
Unlike places like Trigun and Equestria, which are made of Love and Peace.
DON'T the universe couldn'
t handle that
Fuun Saiki.
I've distilled an elixir of lead and pomegranate
So, who's using what pony in Fighting is Magic?
/me 2,14 still thinks Talgeese should have been more than just a cameo in this game :P
Dunno. I just came for the SRW.
nearly fell asleep wearing my contacts
I came for the ponies
I'll be using Rainbow Dash SilkAMV
It's a shame SRW Z2 doesn't have such a kickass OST as OGS.
I'll be using Marshmellow poni. I got her in the personality test.
9Sig: you're now imagining Folka and Kyosuke in Z2
0my brother hates when i say "everypony" or "anypony" or "somepony"
I am best poni
0that makes it more fun to do so
2,14 the: you should call him a silly filly :P
Pinkie Pie is objectively best pony. :P
2,14 Oh! I like this guy
Hehe.
Alteisen was FTW.
2,14 he is teh snoipah
No, it is Rarity
0he basicly called me a colt cuddler.
Lamia in Z2 would be awesome too.
Gilda is best pony
9DAT DYNAMIC KILL
0im going to start using all pony talk when talking to him.
2,14 you could say his effectiveness
uhh no
Still though- WTB moar translated SRW's.
Also, lol at your MOTD.
2,14 *glasses*
Gilda is best gryphon
2,14 got halved
Did you leave it on purpose? XD
9YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
...
Magneto?
0MAGNIETO!
I think everyone can agree on that one.
Magneighto
0he is a river serpent
magneto XD
his last name is magnet-
therefor he must kick ass
2,14 oh dcd...is that guy the main character from the anime you showed us?
Rarity built her own business from the ground up. She devoted her entire career and to making other people look better. Yet she threw it all away without hesitation to make her friends happy.
2,14 the one with the green beam
Trick your brother into watching Season 1.
9yeah Val
2,14 I thought I recognized him
:p
So just to clarify, is the stream starting at 2pm or 7pm?
Hmm.. is Gundam Deathscythe in Z2?
9GARrod Ran
"Gainer" or something?
or Sandrock?
2,14 7pm seviper
9it is
9I just didn't deploy any Wing units
You're the player?
Where my Epyon at?
Alrighty, see you guys tonight then
Think you can show me a Giga Drill Breaker in a sec?
2,14 see you then
There's no Giant Robo in this, therefore it's not perfect :P
9indeed
2,14 but it has veritechs. Which means I love it :P
Don't get me wrong, I think this looks awesome
9Giant Robo
9is in Alpha 1
but there are some mechs I'd really love to see in it
9but then the creator died
Daitarn.
9and the copyright holders were a bitch
Yeah I know
9and didn't want it in any more SRW
You've told me :(
Always are.
Same reason why we don't get more translated SRWs.
2,14 you'd think that if the creator was okay with it in life that there wouldn't BE any copyright claim
I'd think the copyright holders would /want/ more money.
9it's the same with Eva
9if it wasn't for Anno
2,14 considering the idea BEHIND copyright is protecting the ideas of the individual responsible
9Eva wouldn't have made it into SRW
Yeah, but the company doesn't like asking for copyrights lmao.
9he just fucked shit up saying "NO WAY IN HELL MY EVA WILL BE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE GETTER AND MAZINGER. DEAL THE FUCK WITH IT"
SRW fans to stingy copyright holders: "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!"
9*WILL NOT
The one thing I love about Evangelion are the giant robot fights
I love SRW for one thing-
They made Shinji not a bitch.
9I've told them the story
RobotPinkie: god forbid, that's the only thing Evangelion had going for it (And the music)
He went from a crybaby in Evangelion to a cool person in SRW.
2,14 don't think I've seen this ship before
9Rejectan Instrumentalitan, Telling Gendou to fuck his shit uppan
I take it you don't agree, Pontang
He was made into a classic SR pilot
9it was more like
or was that serious?
9he went from normal person in Eva/Alpha 1
You couldn't handle half the stuff
Oh no, I liked the fights. =s
9to fucking badass in Alpha 3
lol I can't tell :P
Yeah, that.
2,14 Oh I like this bot
9Pontang only likes reals
Yeah, animations are awesome sometimes in Eva
2,14 he's like...a samurai mecha
I have this song on my computer.
9Eva is kind of in the middle of the Real/Super Spectrum
Some of the robot battles blew my mind
But I never got the hype behind Eva.
Transformers would be under Real Robots, yes?
NewDCD: I love RahXephon.
=3
but good god the story, I just can't stand it
Hmmm..
9that's a tough call
I'm not sure.
They're big enough to be supers.
They're about as big as Grungusts, aren't they?
I respect that some people do, but I just can't
0i need to go to bed in around 3 hours or so right?
0in order to wake up for movie night
Also, I love the Getter.
9nah Sig
the real reason people watched evangelion was all the nude scenes.. and the music
9they're kind of Gunda-Bing
I also wub Brain Powerd
9*Gundam-Big
srsly
SRSLY love Brain Powerd
I'll be back
My memory's failing me-
9Brain Powerds are reals according to J
I suppose when I've watched so many 80s mecha that Evangelion wasn't particularly special.
What is this. I don't even.
J, NewDCD?
RObots.
9SRW J
Ohhh, cool
9their stats are Real-type
2,14 is it just my internet, or is anyone else getting stutters in the stream?
Stat-wise they'd be reals, yeah.
Really rarely @ Valthe
no I'm getting them too
Eva is NOT the greatest anime ever
Same here, Pontang
Me too VAltheJean
2,14 oh okay
Hope the episode doesn't lag
I much prefer Gurren Lagann over Evangelion.
But I suppose it's inevitable
9the obvious explanation:
it's more of a Character Study
I LOVE Gurren Lagann
Getting stutters from time to time, yeah, sound's off though for poni most of the time :P
9Getter is too much POWER OF EVOLUTION for the stream to handle
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/memes-kia-rage.jpg
2,14 lol
That's why Z2 is awesome.
the reason i haven't and most likely won't watch evangelion is the nude scenes
Did you hear Getter's theme in Alpha?
I enjoyed Gundam Wing a lot, too, though I know it's not as good as some other Gundams
9Wing was bland as fuck for me
The robots were just really nice, though
Ehh, it's not as bad as SEED.
I love Zero, omfg
9well it's hard to be as bad as SEED
That's all I can say about it.
One of my favorite mechs
SEED Looked cool, but I heard it kinda blows hardcore.
How about Mobile Fighter G Gundam NewDCD?
9G is great
SEED becomes quite the drama around episode 30. Then it drops to hell.
Damn...
Didn't the getter pilot used to have better Go Nagai sideburns, though?
Am I a bad person for liking 00 Gundam?
That is what irks me about SEED. It had potential but threw it down the drain to be stupid.
Or did they ditch that in Z2?
9Getter is fucking shit up
Well, there's plenty of other Gundams to watch
SilkAMV: it's not bad at all.
9Sig: he does have them
No, SilkAMV
9it's just ahrd to see on the mugshot
Is Domon Kasshu in z2?
Gundam 00 is the only one that caught my attention at all
2,14 though he's gona need to get a resupply soon
I hear so much crap about it I don't get
I mean the bigger ones.
But I'm more of a fan of Tomino Yoshiyuki than I am of Gundam.
Why didn't people like it?
That's like.. not attached to his face.
I like TTGL, Code Geass, and Evangelion
Not exactly my favorite mech series, but really good I thought
9Gette is pretty much the precursor of Eva
lol some Gundam fans are VERY picky about their Gundams, SilkAMV
Getter is cooler though.
9DERP
9I mean
Simply 'cuz of old time's sake.
2,14 not a big gundam fan myself. But all I know is that Talgeese (versions I,II,III) is badass
9Gurren Lagann
Geass Jumped the shark too many times for my taste. And not in the good way TTGL did.
hello?
2,14 and thus deserves my love :P
But yeah, after I watched L-GAIM, I was hooked on Tomino.
I've pretty much only heard crap about how bad Wing is, which is why I tend to mention that I like it :P
:D
when is next stream/
SilkAMV: many mecha do sadly.
?
I'm turned off by GaoGaiGar because one gy I encountered besically told me to stop liking Gurren Lagann because he doesn't like it
2,14 the next BMN is 7PM EST today
Tell him to eat a dick @ Flutteryay
NewDCD, are you up for a match in BlazBlue later?
uk time?
2,14 holy giant rock monster batman!
9GaoGaiGar is great
9and Gurren Lagann is a love letter to mech anime in general
9specially supers
I did tell him to eat my ex-boyfriend's choe actuallty
*actually
9GL is much more enjoyable when you know what it's tributing
Which BlazBlue, crono_flash?
Use faith on getter 'fore he dies, lol.
*chode
I have Calamity Trigger
9Garrod y u no charge Satellite Cannon?
2,14 BIG-O!!!!! ACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9also I gotta do some Homework after this LOL
I can play either of the PSP games
9long stage is long
Aw, I only have PS3 version
Dude, NewDCD, are you emulating this or do you really have your PSP hooked up lol?
Haha, was kinda hoping for a fight, there :P
it's his PSP
Hmm.
I don't even have a PS3 yet:P
He has his PSP hooked up
9PSP + Remotejoy
9no good PSP emulators yet
This irc...
lol
That's a shame.
And hello :D
I'd grab SRWZ2 but my PSP's a bitch.
:)
Hi!
Analog nub's f00ked.
SEASON 2, LESS THAN 24 HOURS
'Lo.
MY BODY IS READY
9you don't need analog for Z2
9Wow
I know-
9 5 more HP and WHAM, BAM, STRAIGHT TO THE MOONAH
But it's fucked as in it keeps moving left.
So it interferes with every game I play.
Worst moment to happen, too. I almost finished GEB.
I'll be back later, catch everyone at the pre-show
9you can disable your Analog with CFW
Top of the morning everypony!
<-- has no CFW.
Oh my god, Bronystate should do a marathon of TTGL
2,14 hello superbrony
I actually have to buy all that crap.
It's not morning anymore
Well, not since 10 minutes ago
9Flutteryay: tomorrow we'll air the two movies back to back
MOOOOOOOOOOOON
xfd
damn
NewDCD: I'M SO THERE
5 HP.
NewDCD: In realtime?!
Again.
Still haven't had time to finish watching Kamen Rider Kuuga
PONY AND GURREN LAGANN, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANYTHING MORE AWESOME?
9yeah around 9:30 PM EST
What series is that guy with the extending moon punch from?
9Espy: Genesis of Aquarion
I do, Flutteryay.
Ah, Aquarion... I saw the first episode once. Not sure if I should watch more of it.
Pony, Gurren Lagann and Getter Robo.
Touche!
9oh
9RIGHT after the premiere
9I'm streaming Mazinkaiser SKL
And a few million other mecha things, too!
Wow, so many people here already
A friend linked me here. Said that there were robots.
MLP for SRW?
We're here in case there's a 200 person limit
9God I'd play MLP SRW so hard
CaptainSig: Did you notice the GIGA DRILL BREAKER the Pegasus ponies did in Winter Wrap Up?
9and then Big Mac piloted the Alteisen
Friendship is Giant Robots
07there is no 200 person limit here
I did not.
I didn't see too much of the pony stuff, actually.
It's when they clear out the clouds
The things I saw were pretty cool, though.
Oh I see
9fun fact: we're preparing a chatroom surprise
I saw it.
Yay
2,14 DCD: SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
You mean at Rainbow Dash's introduction?
NewDCD: Is it free candy?
I'll youtube it.
At the very end
9something like that
Yeah I guess most people are here because of the giant robots, but personally I like ponies a bit more :(
9it might or it might not involve Giant Robots
I like Ponies and giant robots equally
9I'll never get tired of Amuro's dynamic kill
NewDCD: We get our own Giant Robots?!
9LASTO SHOOTINGU
I prefer robots, but I'm still sticking around for the S2 premiere.
yay
"Frank Sinatra has finished downloading." Oh, fuck, yeah.
9dat Scopedog
ohai
Scopedog used to be Scope Doggy Dogg
In a way I'm waiting 'till a troll shows up.
Wanna see how stuff goes down when they do.
i heard on facebook that this site will be streaming the the first episode for season 2? :O
9if a troll shows up
They are loved
9I'd go MUGEN PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWNCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
9yes, yes we will
2,14 that is correct crakcerjack
xD
Samurai Champloo's awesome.
:D!
9we're the most hot-blooded stream in the internet
You've got SRW.
'nuff said.
Hello, how is everyone doing today?
However I'm very much expecting it to lag like a mofo
Like a donut in a garage, Ironlore.
Hey IrOnLoRe, pretty good.
i was super excited because my best friend and I don't have the HUB and we have been searching all over for a stream :D
This stream is 99% hot blooded and 1% manly tears
9I don't believe it will. Also we have an LQ stream for that
Lol Robot xD
Two separate streams for maximum damage?
LQ is for mules
Manly Tears.
9wow the stream is really behind
So all I have to do is come to the site and you'll be streaming it?
...We need Folka and Fernando up in this bitch.
2,14 you got it crakcer
Crakcerjack: Yup
:awwyeah:
9brb refreshan
It's like the internet does the work for you. You just sit back and internet.
SWEET!
Dai-Gurren.
I hear the Gurren Lagann theme!
Yeah.
Dai-Gurren rocks!
still really behind
That's a vocal-less version of Sorairo days.
:D
I love that song
Used by every TTGL pilot.
Hmm…I see we're watching more robots.
If you want I can link you it later.
Quite good, quite good.
9guys
9gonna go offline for a second
guy.
NEVER
NewDCD: I guess we'll live with that :/
NEVER NEVER NEVER
Take a 20-minute call while Wireless Tether is running on your phone
9we're live again
NEVERRRRR
my ear is burning
Wow, that was literally a second...
FOREVER!
"Eat this!" "NEVEEEEEEEERRRRRRR!"
*Stu screams*
pudding at 4am?
9AW SHIT IT'S AN AREA ATTACK
Haha, yeah.
9>misses
9ahahah oh wow
2,14 >mfw that hasn't even come close to happening yet
Ha.
Lucky bastard.
ohai
:D
:D
Hey mixon, WE FINALLY HAVE A STREAM FOR THE FIRST EPISODE!!!
:D
IRK?!
Yay!
I row knight.
Is there something wrong with thr stream?
:yay:
lol
It keeps stopping every few seconds
Huh? no.
Not for me.
I gotta say that Breast Fire's a lame ultimate attack.
I'm not getting it. "The stream is currently offline"
Huh, 99,800 health eh?
me either
I really hope Ghost doesn't do a show today.
NewDCD: Do you understand what either of them are saying?
I don't want to be tempted
Try refreshing, Jessim?
I set it to low quality, and now it's fine
IM A MELTING POT OF FRIENDSHIP
Your PC couldn't handle the girth of SRWZ2.
I'M A NICE GUYYYYYYYY
omg 24 hours till season 2
Yeah.
07wrong
^
I am your host, the man they call Ghost. I'm a goddamned racist. I'm a goddemned PIECE OF CRAP!
0720hrs 33 mins
Less than 24 hours.
You mad, Flutteryay?
yep, Season 2 starts at 12:30pm Heh heh heh
Yeah, I'm kind of confused at the times. Is this going to be played live at 9AM EST, or after the fact at 2PM EST?
Nah that's a song DJ Alex S made
2,14 Tek: live
it's called Melting Pot of Alcohol
sweet
so..... what is this game, it looks sexy
SRWz2
mib_qpitb7: Super Robot Wars, I believe.
mfw, Ghost appears in Season 3.
Lol.
too bad they dont have the hub on UK TV
Super Robot Wars Z2, yeah.
Think like a million robot animes combined into one disc of awesome.
what time does it premiere in australia?
Or in this case, an UMD.
What console is this on? The GBA still?
CRITICAL
Ha, no.
It looks too high res for GBA
PSP.
PSP
looks like PSP graphics
Oh, makes sense.
this game's cutscenes are awesome... if only it was in engrish ;_;
It's for the PSP.
Which mlp episode should I watch before I start schoolwork?
my screen says that the broadcast is offline
boastbusters
A cool one.
Herpderp.
winter wrap up
2,14 anon: refresh
Switch to low quality ^
Mib, try watching on LQ.
trixie <3
Low quality just shows a cartoon playing :P
Can you fuse Dai-gurren with Gurren Laggan to make Tengen toppa?
I haven't seen boast busters in a while.
I'll watch that one.
valt I did and it still says it
9yeah the LQ Stream ain't live
Nope.
Z2's part 1 of Gurren Lagann.
NewDCD: Oh, okay.
2,14 then I dont know what to tell you, it's working fine for everyone else. Are you using bronystate.net?
so, is there a way to change my name, didn't even mean to choose this D:
Gurren Lagann + Flying Module is the final form of it in Z2.
The next one's been said to do TTGL S2 though, with TTGL.
2,14 you'll have to /quit and relog with a different name
Maybe even STTGL
Or you could use /nick?
alrighty, thanks
nice
im using dinkypage.com/bronystate
2,14 that's why
Anyhow, I'm going to bail now.
Later, everyone.
2,14 use www.bronystate.net
9wow
Wrong site mib_se1x83 .
for some reason I can't stand gundam
9that was...nice, Chirico
9a lot of damage for a Real
why is the stream stopping ever few seconds?
Not a a clue.
im back
Flash just crashed for me.
lol vidoe game
aha, name changed
I was thinking it was just my crazy-slow internet
yesh
9let's hope that makes everything better
you might be able to get him to half health before noon.
It stops every now and then for me as well. It's normal most likely due to the increased volume of users.
that sludge monster... he just wont die
what the hell is he anyway?
So um, why is this screen showing robots fighting, but the popout is playing Megas XLR?
9because the popout ain't live
MEGAS Y U NO IN THIS GAME
Ah okay, thanks
9not yet at least
lolmegas
Megas is too OP for this game.
SilkAMV, he'd be overpowered like hell
2,14 I'd love to see megas in one of these games
Haha :P
2,14 especially because that means Glorft would be fightable enemies :P
Megas just needs to press the 'win' button...literally
Plus, friendly fire would be on as well
Not only for AOE attacks
ALL ATAACKS
2,14 also, just imagine his dynamic kill: teleporting a soda bottle to the enemy's computer
*attacks
Every time an enemy survives he just hits the next button
'Win' 'Bigger Win' 'Biggest Win' 'Epic Win' and so forth
I take it I'm the only one who wants to see NewDCD finish Tomb Raider Anniversary :P
The attack list would be epic though
For missile attacks "Fire Missiles" "More Missiles" "Even MORE Missiles" "FIRE ALL THE MISSILES!"
moar dakka
Reminds me of stuff from Megas XLR
And when all else fails, punch it with your fists.
That's what we're talking about
Heh
Megas in this game
His fists also shoot guns and missiles.
When do the ponies start? just asking.....
As do his feet...or any part of his body.
9oh wow the sstream caught up
Aquarion
9I think the skipping is over
2,14 ponies start after the movies tonight trouble
Megas isn't in this game for the same reason this game hasn't been brought over into english language.
2,14 nah DCd...I'm still getting it =/
Oh! so not until 5-ish?
To awesome to do?
9ffffffffffffffffffffff
I'm still getting freezes too,
And that reason being which EspyLacopa?
^^^^^^This
I can deal if its too much trouble
9I'm going to try streaming something else after this
9and see if it's just SRW
I don't seem to be getting lag.
And lol at how many anons there are i nhere.
Hope Pinkie breaks more fourth walls XD
Surprisingly, me neither
in here*
9so no skipping?
07neither am I atm
9because dari, that worries me
2,14 I'm still getting it, but it might be my internet
hi
07it's Val of course!
Nice, new CGR review
2,14 :<
no I'm getting it too
07Val's provider is derpy net ;)
Hmm, I get a couple skips here and ther actually.
And now it started to skip for me
2,14 no! It's just they decide to do stupid maintenance all the time!
Super attack time!
hi everybrony!
07see derpy net :)
2,14 it should be fine NOW though =/
9FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
Rainbow Dash's favorite genre of music is WUBSTEP.
wub wub woo wub wub woo wub wub wubwubwubwubwub wub wub wobwobwob bwooooow bwubwubwubwub bwooooow bwobwobwobwob
95 people
I love this fanon so much that I might name my first son Fahnon.
Hey, Steam is making Portal free until September 20th!
6Derpy Net Services! Where they give bytes, we fly kites!
That still ain't close to the limit, is it?
07exactly
Oh, they're doing that sale again?
Getting some hiccups here too.
Big mech is big.
9SuperBrony64: THANKS FOR TELLING ME
He's crossing the streams!
Are there any orbital frames in this game?
Yeah getting some random pauses as well.
07yep me too now
NewDCD: Np, apparently they're doing it because classrooms are using Portal for educational purposes.
lol
07what is that thing btw...?
2,14 they're also doing it because they know everyone already HAS it
It's also randomly stopping, so I have to press play again.
ValtheJean: Lol, that too.
mabey
9the only other Vidja series I've seen in SRW is Virtual On
9I don't
9I'm poor like that ;___;
2,14 you never got Portal?
2,14 like...did you not buy the Orange Box?
Oh snap, they got Megas XLR in Low quality stream.
I'll be watching on two streams just in case.
9yeah. Gonna get it now though
im pretty sure pinkie will evaporate the fourth wall in season 2
9Megas is just a recording though
GIGA DRILL BREAKER
I bought the Orange Box on Steam when it was on sale for $10
GIGA DRILL BREAKERRR!!!!
I'm having the same problem, it's pausing but that's cause, of my computer.
imagine
9also
9this battle: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/e5360f4d3fb3833cb9dddcf61f9af958/18532%20-%20Nightmare_Moon%20super_robot_wars.png
lol, these guys dont take damage
bazillion missiles come at you, and you take a step back, and take no damage, even though everything in a mile radius is turned to glass
XD
LOL HE MISSED
Do they have Gunsword?
mib_s7vje4: You should see the attack that shears off half the mecha and it's still standing afterwards. :P
Haha: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/58869
9Gun X Sword is in SRW L I believe
so many quits
ohai zaco_mobile
So many
neat
it's the beeping i tell you
*click*
sup
9he didn't miss
Damn you slow connection!
9he just SHOOTS TWICE AND HITS ON THE THIRD SHOT
9it's just his style
lololol
Next time Nadesico is in a SRW they should have Gekiganger 3 as an actual unit.
ahaha
Kayube, FUCK YES!
Nadesico's crew + Gurren Laggan
does that thing have a massive sword cawk?
BEST! CROSSOVER! EVER!
when's season 2 a'coming
I had a tooth pulled earlier and the gause is bugging me something fierce
derp
every time i see that time thingy for zelda i always hear that sound.. i'm not sure what it's supposed to be but it's like a gate closing or a portcullis or a bridge or something
'lo
i need to get a fill in
something really heavy sounding anyway
but i am afraid of needles
I know the feeling
it was the sound that went along with it though so it makes sense lol
I just close my eyes really tight and imagine the poking is a bee
lol i have a full panic attack and nearly faint if i get one, fun!
gahhhh i am afriad of bees too!
bees, my god
or a potato chip the poked your mouth
imagine a wasp then
Their in my eyes!
lol that is a good one^
jk I respect bees
The topic in this channel is gonna make me scrap
2,14 that's the one thing keeping me from going to Japan
2,14 the Giant Hornets
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knLCbS02T1Y
/me shivers
Lol Val
; D
wasps are even worse than bees!
9time to finish this
2,14 dude dari, have you seen those god damn things?
end it!
Eeyup
Yeah they've practically taken over Tokyo, Val :P
2,14 they're like....the size of your hand!
>has had wasps, bees, hornets, etc fly around and land on him all his life
>has never been stung
2,14 GET THEM OFF ME! I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ON ME
wow
2,14 AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2,14 well, I've never been stung either
lol i would run away flaling my arms and screaming
2,14 but I'm deathly afraid of it
If you leave them alone, they won't do anything to you.
:P
2,14 considering my mother is allergic to them
/me adds to his list
>attack RainBro dressed as a giant moth
/me 2,14 is going to murder you dari
>attack Val dressed as a giant hornet
i have never been stung either, but also horribly afraid of them
Dari, Japanese Bees are huge
Basically spit acid fire
And could murder your ass if you got close
Anyone want to see a size comparison, so you know how big these giant hornets are? :P
Rodman: I know how big they are
Sure
2,14 I'm not afraid! I have my +9 Trident of Hornet Repelling
2 inch wingspan
It's not fun. I've had an entire nest swarm my face.
Besides anything that evolved in Australia, those things are high on my list of horrors to avoid at all costs
You can probably see them on wikipedia
Don't look at this, Val http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/wong/gianthornet2.jpg
I have gotten stung before, it's not that bad only hurts for like a sec.
Those things look evil
Yeah, they're pretty big
>2 inch wasp
beest
>full sized human
the stream is lagging on my end...
IDC about them.
they looks sooooo evil
2,14 yeah well, you're forgetting about the venom dari
9gonna restart the stream and try streaming something else, k?
Does anybody else's stream lag?
2,14 okie doki loki
Yeah they are RobotPinkie.
yes
wait, he's almost dead
lots of lag
Average.
finish off this boss first
Though I agree that bees and such aren't anything to be afraid of
I get lag between every few seconds
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4MqTCIDKhU
This man disagrees, RP
Hornets you need to fear
^ Nope
I keep getting dropped
MY stream shut down.
Hornets are just big wasps, nothing to fear about wasps.
They will sting the eff out of you for no paticular reason
When is the times for preshow requests?
Unless you happen to be alergic.
nicolas cage is a horilbe actor
2,14 which is why I'm terrified dari :P
dang dude.. close your mouth before you make me feel like i'm swallowing bees
Well, AllisZero, the bees being a danger might have something to do with the thrashing and screaming.... :P
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/174/201/UlnNI.jpg?1316102478
9we're live again

9your job is to tell me if this lags
9begin.

9wait
9forgot to tweak audio source

Lawl
9okay
Yeah, pretty much
9NOW We're live
9starting
2,14 yeah still getting stutters
Stutters for me as well.
lag
Same
If you see a bee, just nudge it out with the morning paper or something.
lagging like a mofo
it is a little laggy for me
Oho, what show is this?
I burned my popcorn :D
i have killed 3 wasps
Yeah, getting lag
there's a bit of lagging here and there, good thing it lasts a few seconds
THis is odd. The strem didn't lag few hours back.
There are a billion more people on it now, probably, lawl
smegma?
what's this anime? also, lag, lag everywhere.
i like her
They're fighting Robotnik!
Machine Island!
smegma is nasty dstuff
Yes, it keeps stopping/starting.
What is an anime? A miserable pile of chibi?
^
lag
Well don't know about the miserable pile part. But name would be cool
shup
everypony
9Mazinkaiser SKL
lol
9it's 3 eps long
What up, MrChang
brb
uh
how come it says invalid PW for my name?
yeah quality is excellent, but it has some lag
Hope this lag gets fixed before the movies start.
RobotPinkie it's basically, Japan animation. Though chibi characters, are a huge thing in them now.
9MrChang
Me too
9there were password resets
yes, DCD?
oh
What's that RobotPinkie?
9go to the help and ask for help
#help
What's what, WhatPayne?
9#help
You too
Oh, I hope the lag stops before stream time
Right, that.
9AND THEN DAT OPENING
It's pretty bad right now.
UKfag.
Reporting in :D
I AM AN UFO!
So, are these mech in SRW?
9not SKL
9but Mazinkaiser is in several
what are we watching
i wish i could play the song of double time.. after playing the suns song.. then i would not have to go to sleep once again before season 2
9also I'll stream this full series post-premiere
9since it's three episodes and all
Streaming 720p from NASA without a problem, just tried.
So no, it's not my connection :P
dang lags!
IT'S MECHA-GUTS!
Btw. DCD when can we request preshow stuff at #Vinyl_scratch?
I hear an awesome song
yeah! guitars!
9okay
9dari
Having some big stutters on low quality stream, could be because my laptop suck bigtime though
9can you take over?
2 hours and 30 minutes left to showtime, in Spitfire time :P
lolol
I kind of have a lot of stuff to do, but I could just play youtube requests I suppose.
Don't bother with the spitfire time
nothing happens
9just for a while
lol
I take that back, those were some of the cheesiest vocals I've ever heard.
9I want you to take over to see if the stutters are just me
Oh okay, thanks SilkAMV
why am I watching the intro again?
Hmm, now it's playing smoothly on my end.
9all yours
lol, japanese metal
Ok
Starting up FME, gimme a minute.
2,14 you have thirty seconds
2,14 WORK FASTER
MFW coding/making site and streaming at the same time, GTFO with your 30 seconds
2,14 :P
When will season 1 be streamed?

2,14 right after the movies
S1 will be streamed after BMN finishes
BMN?
Brony Movie Night
Stream's up
YAH PMVS

9no stuttering
9phew

9I'm glad!
Need to resize
Ohoho
Anyway, this is awesome.
2,14 lol, same here dcd :P
No stuttering here either
I now need to favourite it.
9that said, Dari, how many KBPS you streaming at?
u troll...
350
Not using your method ATM, busy.
9Crisis averted.
No lag for me, woot it's working fine now.
9can you restart at 550?
We doing requests in #Vinyl_Scratch?
Yeah.
9since that's the standard
At DCD
Hey guys, Dawn of the Final Day: http://i.imgur.com/2Pyrz.jpg
this is perfect for me aswel, whereas the anime had terrible lag
9 550 video I mean
IT WENT DOWN RIGHT BEFORE THE GOOD PART
Wait, are we talking about the IRC lagging (I just got here)
Stream, RandomExtra
Ok, stream's back up.
4nope, the stream
It will start skipping because I'm gunna open Flash.
Ah, my IRC was just slow in connecting, so I thought we were talking about the IRC.
If it isn't currently.
9yeah it's working fine
9just me!
9phew!
This stream works well.
9crisis averted, gents
Yeah, works for me too
So far, so good.
No lag here yet
0my bad (think it's back to normal)
Nice
9it isn't
9so it's just me
0works fine for me
Well, the frame-rate is in the can but at least it isn't skipping
WhatPayne same here
Framerate is crap because I'm doing a lot of shit.
9>110 viewers
<_<
9>still a ways off from the premiere
9we're gonna reach critical mass
2,14 dari keeps bogging down his computer with all teh pronz :P
9but it isn't skipping
We're gonna need a bigger boat...
9that's what matters

9SPITFIRE KO
i love it!
NewDCD, my body is ready.
MFW voice still not better
<_<
9is Sig still here?
The stress tests failed to capture the sheer number of people this stream is going to end up having.
>_>
9cause this is specially for them http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/cca1ab40a399e68cbbb32d5ca0132878/18063%20-%20Apfelteisen%20Eeyup%20big_macintosh%20super_robot_wars.png

Hmm.. Im done with Dead Island.. This stream has my full attention now
All GTFO to the ones we agreed.
Rarity? Silly SilkAMV, that's not how you spell Trixie
:P
huh i can reach EQD
07zomg
Hey everypony!
Now all I need is Herospirit and RDash
07waaaaat
I'm just glad the skipping was just me
I was REALLY worried
07me too..
I can't remember...was it Luna or Celestia?
i have a question for somepony to awnser plz!
Herospirit not here yet?
07go ahead
Luna was the mods one, Celestia was the admin one (still not entirely happy with this system <_<)
ah
Nope, havent seen him.
07ohai Luna
i wont be able to watch the stream of season 2 premire so iim trying to get a screan recorder program going
Im sure he will suddenly pop in just any time now though
That's weird.
Woona within Woona? WOONACEPTION
I'd be surprised should he not.
07yerrrr
but so far i cant find anyting that will run past an hour. i need something to run at least 10 hours or mor
07something like that :D
or more
anypony got any ideas? cant find anything from google either... TT-TT
Sixthgate: Oh wow, I'd just wait till the episode appears on YouTube.
0dat flank
0=P
YES SCHOOLS OUT EARLLLLLY
In 10 hours could you expect the episode to be on youtube anyway?
O.o oh. Whoops! XD
lol rarity looked like she was flirting with rainbow there
If you want good quality for that long you'll more than likely need to pay for a program.
idk....? im gona be at work and i cant watch access the brony state there due to firewall crap
Snapz Pro X works exceptionally well, but it only works on a Mac.
rarity pony may be best pony, but rainbow-dash is out of her league >.>
0yeah, I give it an hour from airing at the most for it to be on YT
now rarity will make a man out of-AW MAN
And you get a free 15 day trial for it
Hurray Pinkie Pie song!
*knows all the words*
07Oh god Woona sounds so adorable too
what the heck?
0who here doesn't?
Im scared to turn my volume up.. I expect something like a screamer
SOOOOO
:P
XD
Thank you very much everypony! i think ill just wait for it to come YouTube cuz i have a downloader for that. XD
well I'm Canadian so I have Treehouse TV
I can sing this song.
ohhhhhhhhh boy I'm excited
and its still a little less than a day for season 2
it says for Sunday the 18th, the next episode is Trinidad Stilts
that makes no freaking sense
YEAH
LOVE THIS ONE
I know not everyone is too keen about the whole S1 stream, but I am super excited about it
unless it's a later episode
wait wut? episode 2s name is trinidad stilts?!
I've been purposefully neglecting my pony addiction for this event :P
no
It should be The Return of Harmony Part 2
that's the point
http://treehousetv.com/watch/shows/MyLittlePony/default.aspx
oooh

2,14 lol dari
Sixthgate Don't worry about it. I got bit misty eyed from it as well.
This is pretty damn much effort put into a side pony that only had 2 lines in the entire show so far
We may have a problem
[18:30] *Rainbow-Dash* Curses. The stream derped. "Max connections from your IP"
*crys rivers of tears like pinky pie from episode 2*
07sooo much me!
...guys, I think something just went off in my pants.
That vid made me think about my old SNES.
O.O
that's because luna is best alicorn even with 2 lines
woona!
Luna is best pony methinks
Derpy Hooves is just as popular and she only had one line :P
DONK
I rly hope luna comes back in season 2....

No offense to the header.
07She will

So many hours left to wait
that this vid has been on loop for like the past hour?

Just a feeling I have.
We need a time bot for this room to tell us how long till Season 2 premieres.
Would this count as A or B movie?
07Labyrinth?
We don't have a countdown bot?
0A I think
Dari What are the numbers for?
Traffic lights
I've never even heard of the movie.
I mean teh Mane Six numbers.
Yes. Traffic lights.
lol

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
What a troll
I prefer corridor of cupcakes
07evil flash I tell you!
XD
True dat
u know that one skit where applejack jumps off that plaform to help dashie get in the air faster than she can take off?
Otherwise it takes your computer down with it.
Quick question, what's the cap of people for this stream/chat?
lol love this pmv
No cap.
Flash is not evil, MLP FIM was made with flash.
0sweet
someone took that same skit and put the music to JackAss the movie to it
This music makes me wonder; is MLP FIM known at all in Japan or on 2chan?
9cap is HOWEVER MANY WE CAN MANAGE
ya
9which is probably in the thousands
And I'm sure during the time MLP was being made some of the animators learnt once again to save often.
Rainbow-Dash: Wonder why Season 2 took so long to premiere? Now you know...
BECAUSE FLASH WILL RANDOMLY CRASH ON YOU LIKE A BITCH
hmmm, the chat popout doesn't seem to be working
Thats true..
PinkieThePie: If you're on www.bronystate.net it should
OMG WHAT
LONG LIVE THE AGE OF BRONY
either that or pinkie pie comes out the screen and crashed your flash
i am, but when I click it all that happens is a blank windo opens
oh hey pinkie
Ohhh
So...why is the vid slightly off center?
I know why.
Just asking.
PinkieThePie: Don't worry about it
0Alright, I think ima go shower and head to bed. so i can be awake for movie night/season 2
0later everypony

Flash isn't happy with you today. Did you forget the sacrifice?!
oh, i did'nt know that
Great song
Unless of course I go full Cupcakes in the process
07Dari
07get ABP
Holy shit, a pony in my well!
the human looks like a human applejack
really, I don't expect the movie to be TOO unbearable. At least it's not "The Princes Promenade"
Pretty sure I did download it.
The orange pony with her is applejack.
lolol she does!
Don't play with vital airbubbles like that!
right as she said Nightmare moon it shows her reflection in the hourglass
shoo be doo
07hmm which browser are you using atm?
07chrome?
thats so freaky!!!! *shivers*
Be glad it's just G1 and not G3 or worse... G3.5
firefly
I didn't even know gen 1 existed until now, an i am glad. No offense to you ponies out there.
SHUSH
Firefly was awesome. I'll give G1 that.
G3.5 WAS NEVER MADE
no, it do not believe in magic!
Ok...so g1 is mind crushing but not soul crushing
I'll probably switch us over to our new chat system in about 5 minutes.
So...
so we got that.
Get ready for that.
so is discord like one of the original bad guys from one of the earlier pony seeries?
:>
im 25 and what is this
/me is ready
Firefly was RDs beta design.
Rainbow Dash is based on her
She has to be awesome
Yeah.
already ready!
G3.5 never happend! >.>
G3.5 did happen.
Has Megan tasted the Rainbow yet?
3.5?
shoo be doo
snititai I'm afraid it did
Not for long though.
IT CANT SEE US IF WE CANT SEE IT
I know v.v
3.5 is canon
Is RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE G3 or G3.5?
3.5, uh
ug
canon?
....lots of pink credits.
3.5, Flutteryay
3.5 needs to be shot out of a cannon
sixthegate look up "Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel Adventure"
both actually
Oh god
samurai jack
can somepony describe all the generation quickly?
...Oh god jack.
sam jack
Oh snap! Samurai Jack was da shit!
okai ill look it up
lololol
Here's all you need to know about 3.5:
Heck yeah, Samarai jack.
Magic apple sword.
don't watch it
ever
Yes.
sam applejack
anon: G1 flat characters but fun villains
but a silly pony wielding a magic apple...
what really bugs me about 3.5 is that they replaced the cookies that sweetie belle made, in the opening, and replaced it with fruit
more like samurai applejack
I don't think that G2 even had a show (although I could be wrong on that)
G1: Great, but old. G2, Better looking, but more girlish. G3, New design, crap stories. G4, BEST EVER!
Heres what you need to know about Samurai jack
a lame attempt to ban all kinds of sugary stuff
Watch all of it.
A pony show with a sword at all sounds pretty wild. Even if it is an apple sword. Do they stab anyone with it?
G2 stupid, silly stuff
thank goodness that Pinkie Pie is a sugar fiend
Applejack always dresses in samurai outfits from feudal Japan
Yeah.
G1 had the SMOOZE!
G3 Lowest common denominator shit that spoke down to it s viewers
G4: BEST DAY EVER
You can't stop THE SMOOZE!
http://mylittlewiki.org/w/images/9/9b/Untitled-10.jpg
Smooze
G2, followed by G3 and 3.5 and Newborn Cuties
G3.5 somehow DUMBER than G3.
?
on the list for worst
The Smooze was an awesome bad guy
...*Tilts head*Whats this...
but G2 is the least watching for me
Rainbow Dash was the fashion pony.
G3.6 NEWBORN PONIES. nuff said
Put all my stat points into STR?
what's the difference between G3 and G3.5?
lol this is funny
mainly because I can GET the stupid kiddie stuff, but I can't stand the teen girlie talk
Rainbow Dash always dresses in Style
What about 4.5..?
lol
G3.5 the ponies are, um
@anon G.5 is worse
worse looking
3.5 is called "chibi ponies" as they changed the art style to make them look "cuter"
These are perfect lessons.
*G3.5*
hey guys guys hey
I'll toss in an image
07https://adblockplus.org/en/
its a riddle
http://capinaremos.com/files/2011/09/nao_tem_dica_no_nome_RA.jpg
really?
hello there
you know what g.3.5 needs?
If there is a G4.5 or G5, I wonder if it will still be good
Tell me what it is
Isn't a pony already a chibi horse?
Blasphemer. Nothing is cuter than G4 Applebloom.
pony tits
usually, 3.5 is just called 'crap'
Or G4 filly Luna.
newborn cuties though is worse
damn right ntonio9 :P
art and content
got me a full minute to realize
An actual horse must look like a freaking viking to these ponies.
...What if they did a spinoff of FiM, covering Celestia and Luna's childhood?
for a good recap of the non-FIM generations, check out this: http://miburl.com/HDqnAC
Or in the current day
ok....who told me to watch "Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel Adventure"
nothing is cuter than fluttershy!
espylacopa that would be interesting, but I think it would work best as a mini-series/TV specail
gosh, it's that guy. i hate the guy.
What your country can steal from itself.
sixthgate that'd be me
g5 will probably be bad because lauren faust wont be working on it
WHAT THE FUDGE DID I JUST WATCH?!?!
EspyLacopa you mean like that?
http://imgur.com/l5LXx
I really want to know the artist of that img
If the art, setting, names etc stay the same, it won't be G5 will it?
sixthgate G 3.5
>_>
RAWRity......
Is the thing off air?
I make it a point to not clickie the shortened URLs.
omg pokemon and ponies
2,14 PONYMON
It never hapend
u mad bro?
EVER
oh
its on imgur
...
Also, my money on when this peters out is that they'll make a G4.5 where they do the same, just with
I dunno, G1-G3 are pretty similar visually
for anybody else?
hang on
You're watchin' My Little Pony?? SO?!
3D CGI models
oh
TT-TT
http://i.imgur.com/l5LXx.jpg
direct link
IM sad bro
well, shit
Zephirdd: That image is all kinds of awesome.
Robotpinkie actually G3 is noticeably "shinier" than the others
So...whats the request chat again?
That's awesome
I just wished I knew the artist
#Vinyl_Scratch
yeah i noticed that....
or Vynil_Scratch
dunno how you write it
That's right.
RAWRity: So you'd say they're not similar to G2 and G1 visually?
07We are not taking requests at this point :)
07this is just our playlist
I just realized that we had 127 people. During the preshow...:O
G2 didnt exist on TV afaik
Just curious for later.
it was just toys
Fuck
RandomExtra: Yea, just imagine how many there'll be for the main stream
Have to open flash again.
Hey thar everypony
Incoming derpage
hm...
/me is ready
it
07hey TreyLove
is showtime but the broadcast is offline?
Hey thar TreyLove!
/me tacklehugs Luna
robotpinkie yes and no. They've similar in the design of the ponies, but as they were mostly computer animated, it had a very different look to it, being more glossy and vibrant with the colors
2,14 what URL are you using treylove?
/me is eating soup
But when Luna, when???
TreyLove: Make sure you're on www.bronystate.net
I'm back.
... The chat speed...:O. This'll be fun.
For a little bit, anyway.
hrm. dinkypage.com
Yeah, I heard the site was doing movie night in celebration of Season 2
/me considers the possibility of him drinking soup
brb then
2,14 we always have movie nights
Shall I redirect dinkypage and co.cc to .net or what?
2,14 but
2,14 this week, we're streaming all of S1 after the movies in honor of S2
i'd say yes dari
Okay, I still think they look similar enough. G3.5 was a pretty radical departure visually
cool
Hmmm... Since Dinkypage still has Veemi, I say that it'd be a good idea.
redirect them
okay
why not
:\
Anyone wanna play Super Smash Bros. Brawl online?
Ok.
a lot of people have the wrong addresses
is audio going to be off during streaming?
I got nothing better to do
as in not lining up?
/me adds it to his epic shit-long list of things to do
well im gone everypony! see u tonight if able!

2,14 Fridays are 7PM, Saturdays are 2PM

0I love the MvC3 video Maximilian made with this song
lauren would make one of the best drawfriends ever

that's what I'm saying is that the stream does not appear to be broadcasting
Damn lag...
6THAT WILL NOT GET YOU YOUR PRECIOUS NICK BACK!!
If I registered my nickname, how do I sign in as that nickname?
Song name?
Luna's about to take over.
ok
Since my Virgin hate me
my ISP*
now the chatbox is anoying placed below the video
Okay, I'm seeing a fluttershy song that's lagging horrendously now. That's progress.
it fits
Jigglysaint are you runing no script?
I got a fever, and the only perscription is more Ponies!
thats weird, changing ports isn't working either, and I've restarted the phone

Isn't it /ns not /msg?
the nostalgia critic is a BRONY

maybe if I go directly there instead
Funny thing, Luna: I was talking to Apple Cider about his last show with Eurobeatbrony
Alright, identified!
/me prances about proud to have his name
Now that Luna's in control, we're about to have the best party ever!!
Lyra are you registering all the nicks...?
hi everypony!
sweet
I got something
the stream is lagging
I know the stream is lagging.
wait
I've said.
Luna is in control?
what's on the stream right now?
My ISP is being stupid.
FallSilently: Nah.
SUP PONIES
Ok after nuking my internet Everything is better
no kidding
Luna is going to take over.
stream this:
She won't have ant lag.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGTuXIqf880
I already had Lyra and VinylScratch, and it appears I no longer have Octavia. Heh.
any*
Maybe there are too mane people watching?
how do i get the chatbox and the stream to be next to eachother, not one above the other?
07nah
*many
Luna
You ready now?
are they stream something from the cartoon network?
07I took over ;)
2,14 DesertRose: zoom. Ctrl+mouse wheel
just irc.ponychat.net
6Luna is now in control~
Hurray for Luna!
2,14 she is...*glasses*....assuming control
If anything from cartoon network, let it be dexter's laboratory
thats better
Real client. Much better.
:D
hurry
i mena
hurray
Luna... yay
yeaaaaaaaaaah
try something else
IN DEXTERS LAB
Haven't seen Dexter's in more then 6 years I think :P
lag again?
is this being streamed from youtube?
I did
07yes it is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGTuXIqf880
The fact that I like this show was even further clarified in the faust interview with EQ daily.
Dexter's Laboratory was the best
Test Test
or the cupcakes horrorcore rap!
ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
Are you taking requests Luna?
like fluttershy.whatever
WHOOO, i'M IN CHAT AGAIN
also Ed,Edd and Eddy that was a legend show
woo, i *love* this song!
07not yet
Just read that interview :P
Luna isn't in control yet for me.
<3 this song
When she namedropped some of the staff as working on Dexter's Lab, Foster's, and Samurai Jack
there's a music vid for this? YEAH
I love how we're all basically watching someone else watch youtubes here.
:|
okay that's not it
I was like "This now makes perfect sense to me."
I am getting something totally different
Dexter was awesome, and so was Johnny Bravo, and Courage the Cowardly Dog
Could somepony tell me if there's a limit for this stream?
lawl rawl
07there is no limit
.......................tell me this isn't a twiluna vid?
Brilliant
2,14 limit? no. there can be as many people as there are bronies :P
DAMNIT SEAON 2 WHY U NO COME QUICKER
oh god Nightmare Mode.the first time i actually can swallow watching this one
is youtube not loading fast enough for the streamer? cause i think i'm catching all of the video but it's choppy.. and it seems to play at a normal speed
Normally I micspam pony songs on tf2, so feels nice not having to send it this time :P
...1.2 gigaviewers?
Wait Luna is a "reaper"?
LAGS
i used to sing this in the shower when i was on an internship in germany
zaco_mobile: is a reason for disconnection/no connection given? Like timeout or something?
I hope there won't be any lags tomorrow :/
LAAAAAG
I wonder if that's why there's lag
make it stop!
Or does my connection just suck?
2,14 the lag is because of dari's ISP
Luna: no limit.. oh.. oh my... I'm just thinking about what will happen when 10000 people show up
my flatmate asked me waht i was singing (my shower singing was kinda infamous in the flat)
2,14 we're switching streamers in a second
so i had to explain ponies to her
sorry has blade runner been on or am i early?
Wait who controls the stream?
Internet service provider = ISP?
Who controls the horizontal?
this is lagging becaue someone is donwloading piracy movies
I dont think its the stream lagging, seems to be the youtube buffer thats the problem
Who controls the vertical?
And te vertical?
Doctor, the lag has come back.
ARGH
timing out
she was amused, but thought i was silly and, to her credit, tried the show, but didn't like it
Please, stop talking about the lag, it'll stop in a couple minutes.
okay who can see the stream and who can't
Doctor do you hear it?
it's so much nicer than the UK
/me goes to get an Arizona Tea
I can see it :P
I WUV FWUTTERSHY
The sound of beeps?
15Well, considered the amount of people on this stream, and the average upload speed of an average guy, it's almost a miracle we don't have MORE lag xD
The lag, isn't that bad for me.
The lag isn't that bad. Just undeniably noticeable.
Stephen Magnet!
Gig: it's being CDN'd
zaco_mobile: You could try increasing the timeout time. I see some Verizon users had to do that. There are mixed claims of Verizon blocking all common IRC ports or filtering the traffic somehow. I'm not really sure though.
2,15 gig: first off no colors :P. Secondly lag is unrelated to the people that show. It only compares the streamer's upload speed to your download speed
mib_ocxusq, blade runner is later
wait what?
Jon: doctor who?
2,14 the number of people only effects chat speed
you mean it won't work for Canadians?
LUNA
lol
<3 that desktop
lol i see Wowhead
nice background
Best desktop ever o.o
lol luna background showoff
Doctor Whooves please
0I know that the upload speed shouldn't depend of the amount of connected people
is this nightmare mode?
i want that background
6Luna is magical~
/me comes back with a gallon of green tea
well now we know LUNA has asumed control
ultimate mlp please
hm.....yes!!!
W00T
I'm in Canada and it works fine, so I don't think that's a problem.
yes chedd
Tea :D
I think this will last long enough
hmm
did you get that?
LunaTheForgotten: this is a wonderful idea
/me goes to get tea himself
I'm in the lands of nether
The song was sounding nice and ..now its meh with the voice.
how many liters is in a gallon
and I allowed everything in Firefox

Nothing?
LunaTheForgotten: honey

So every time luna calls Celestia 'tia' my mind goes 'Aunt+Niece=Big sister???"
Dunno, just decided to work

I wish I had it to spend on plushies
I'm still here for another hour...
If you were gay, that'd be okay.
Then I'm only coming back around 11:30
this is the reason why rainbow dash is connected to gay
pm
0so, can the Avenue eQestria musical just exist already?
If you were queer, I'd still be here
It exists in our minds...
0lol
to be honest, i think pinkie's probably gayer than dashie
I'll be back around 6 or 7
Year after year!
Because you're dear to me
hi DesertRose
0How does this work so damn well?
i would?
And I know that you
Would accept me too

Welcome to your Doom!
0I AM
PLOT HOLE!
Nah, still thinking about stuff for the game
6Dat plot
@Puppy I'm already wearing my pinkie ears
Well she didn't know that one
I like the idea of Blueblood being batman, but I like Luna being batman more
0more plot hole?
Going to start working on it more after I get this ponymation done
to be fair at this point she didn't know that was a sonic rainboom
HEy
She didn't know it was a SR
plot
SHE DIDINT KNOW IT WAS A SONIC RAINBOOM
but she didn't know it was a rainboom...
Ok. What are you using for the animation?
So thats the explaition
0Dat hole
I can't hear "plot hole" anymore :(
THAT DOESNT COUNT AS A PLOT HOLE
lol
HS THOUGHT IT WAS A RAINBOW NOT RAINBOOM DURP DURP
THE HELL DID IT SAY ABOUT RARITY?!
Flash CS4
she had no idea thats what it was!
That's not a plot hole how could've she known THAT was a Sonic Rainboom?
though she didn't know it was a Sonic Rainboom
that mayor
Nice.
Um, it's not a fucking plothole, because she didn't realize it WAS a Sonic Rainboom until the events of Cutie Mark Chronicles
13beeb
that's what i said
Lots of beep.
Hello
agree with mac
Is Photoshop CS4 any good. Am thinking about "upgrading"
thats what i said too
gah the lag! it infuriates me!
0yeah <3
YEAH
FUCK THAT ASSHOLE
0O.O#
0my favourite
MLP HAS NO PLOTHOLES
0Or, because she's pinkie pie
YES I AM
NEW SCREENSHOT FROM THE FACEBOOK

I think it's decent enough, for my needs at least
0I don't lag, it's your side, sooooorry ^^
gah!
Not as stable as CS3, but still
0(And I'm on another continent, so weeeel.)
STOP SAYING "PLOT HOLES"
Nice topic. really
I've been using CS2 for ages.
Hey :D
It's dirty.
LOVE THIS VID SO FREAKING MUCH
I know it's my side and that's what pisses me off >:(
Bronystate is showing the season two premiers, right?
i can't wait for the new content as season 2 happens
BRONIES FOREVER
:P
07yep Hexalan
This is my jam!
2,14 yes hexalan
And I have heard CS4 is the worst adobe release to date.
live?
0mfw The appears in system messages
07yes
yes i am proud to be a brony
0I love you guys.
CS5 is even worse
0*BROOHOOF*
love this song
Hilariously derailing one-liner
gah
/me is proud too
I need to enlist my sister to record this
isn't pinkie pie time all the time?
YES I AM
This should be our anthem
Hey guys i just joined up ^^ what are we watching?
This song is the national anthem for Bronies.
0let's shout it out today. I'm a brony!
Just that I'm using CS4 for some compatibility issues
I am proud to be a pony ^.^
/me brohoofs everyone
I love this song so much
*brohoof*
squee
SQUEE
New screenshot from facebook has a glaring animation error. The entire season needs to be postponed 3 weeks to correct it guys, sorry :( http://i.imgur.com/DDvqn.jpg
"I am hularius and you will qoute everything I say!"
*mansqueal*
awesome
hey fillies, what's up?
squeak
Really CS5 is even worse. Someone at adobe suggested skipping CS4
im never ashamed to be a brony
Any idea why I'm watching Megas instead of ponies?
i shout it out everywhere
I think squee is the wrong onomatopaia for that sound
not that I'm complaining
this sing is...kin da cool actually :O
it's too sharp
argh
try "gwee"
Megas, what?
I'm going to be gone when it shows
Well thanks for that info. I think I'll go to either CS4 or CS3...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eh4iLM372k
i want merchandise in germany already
LOL what should be streamed? The video of ALL animation errors in season 1!....eh no thats like 72 minutes
*squee*
I looked on the HUb showing scheldule

07Val
Image is a spoiler guys. Careful.
07get ready
2,14 my fave song?????
I've got nothing on the page, and Megas on the LQ pop-out
/me squees with excitement
07after the next one
makes being a brony 20% cooler
Premiere is decent, but Adobe screws up with Flash especially
MyBodyIsReady: what about photoshop cs5?
it shows the same eosode happening 9:00-9:30 and 9:30-10:00
So... we have a theme song now?
I CAN'T SING ALONG WITH ALL THE SONGS.
is that supposed to happen?
You love this song too, ValtheJean? :O
omg I am shock
love this part
THIS IS AWESOME
2,14 my body is ready
play all the songs!!!
I CAN
TAKE A URSA ANY DAY
*cheers for twilight*
I need to learn to play this on guitar
Dunno really about After Effects, Dreamweaver, Premiere and Photoshop that much, since I mostly just use Flash from Adobe
Photoshop CS5 is fine, I really like its Black and White filters
0My pony is ready

brohoofs? Naw nigga I do the "rainbow dap"
0Long story made short
0Everyone need to refer to a standard

Squeee!
Should I revert to CS3 with AE or go to CS5?
0Most of a time, to an idol or to an group (= creed)
I got pony toys!
lol this is funny
Ha!
WTF happened while I was gone
LOL AJ : DJ AMNESIA HERE WOKE UP 5 DAYS AGO IN A DITCH wow awesome
well, it's not technically correct, but discrimination against nations is usually referred to as racism
Oh this song is pretty cool.
LOL!
MC Public Urination :D
0So YEAH, we're all fucking racist, deal with it and leave us alone
Topeka did change its name to Topikachu in the late 90s

MC I get side-tracked easily

Cuz Megas is almost as epic and ponies
gingerbrony666: Look up

07nope
If i hadn't heard this so many times i would be ok with it
0It won't
this song isn't even japanese...
Lag is one thing but jumping all over the video?
0'cause the server is dispatching it
0Long story made short
After Effects is probably a poor choice for that, so I'd say Flash is your best choice
0I know Puppy, that's the worst part
Nu är vi här med Caramelldansen!
0He will only upload it once
0...thats awesome :D
wtf
0Oh there it is
I guess I should ask if Flash is easy to learn.
what next? nayn cat?
0And then you will download it from the server
Best.....Animation....Ever
0(Kinda like youtube)
lol this sint fitting
0wtf

erm
IKR, WhatPayne
Serspring: Pretty much, just remember it's 9 AM EST.
