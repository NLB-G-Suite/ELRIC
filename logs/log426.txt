WTF R THEY ON THE MOON ?????????????????
02nope, single lens reflective
Wait, is that the discussion now?
oh dear.....
07SLR/DSLRs use a mechanical flap to control the amount of light that goes into the sensor/film
Single-lens reflex camera - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera
07in addition to the aperture, etc
03so basically SLR has removable lens, that's the diff?
02yep
07no
02there's more though
He fess up?
HAHAHAH
me sides hurt
07there are point and shoots with interchangeable lenses
6heheh
6aperture
DSLRs you are p. much guaranteed like more control like ISO, apeture, shutter, etc
I remember Veggietales
GTA moon
hey
HAHA
I ate veggies.
gta moon??
PAS can have controls like that, but it's not guaranteed (i look for models that do)
epic
xD
damn you guys!
hahahaha
i left
03so how do you tell the difference just by looking
it got borin
DSLRs also may have RAW output mode, raw sensor data, more control, etc
<Digitalis> I know dat feeling
13wat...
Oh yeah
11,01Lol.
Righit
I was laughing to hard xD
13that's just dumb
Whoops
lol
???
that was fun
can we play somethin like tf2
or l4d2
11,01The moon is fun.
or l4d
d'aaaw
That was... a thing
The moon is a desolate wasteland.
that was.....epic XD
the moon is awesome
Hmmm...
DSLRs are usually bigger than PAS
look at some photos of both and you'll see the form difference
do it
Egad
11,01Oh.
dat RD theme...
RD
11,01OK.
LETS DO THIS!
LEEEEEROY!
leeeeeeeeeeeeeroooooooooy
11,01PW sillyfillies.
JEEEEEEEEEEEENKINS
Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah!
02They’re a lot faster and have greater accuracy then other methods used by point and shoots
look at my avatar
it rocks
?
shit nooooooo
@raritymeter
hmm
6 You are 82% rarity. (52)
Huzzah
BALD
bahld?
BOOM
huzzah
hazah?
itititit
hyes xD
xxxxxxxx
1,3that just looks like a really bad plan right there
HAHAHAHA
02Also, dSLRs usually have a CMOS censor, which is a lot bigger than CCDs found in point and shoots.
that moonwalk
Actually WATCHING the tutorial?
I'm watching, this time
How do I shot asteriks
GTA moon
02Nikon used to use CCD, but that changed a few years ago
02now they only use CMOS
LOL
*cough*
02for their dSLRs
Well, you can't run people over or control the Lunar Rover's radio.
Believe me, I TRIED
lmao! xD
aaaww toovad
too bad*
SHIIIIIIIIIIIII SD
02Canon has never used CCDs in their dSLRs
hahahahahahahaha
sheeeeeyt
XD
02so 1 up for canon there

No wrath?
It seems he's a bit preoccupied.
But I surely do need a source on dat tasty "Oh my"
Singularity + Throw = TO THE MOOOOOOOON
I was just worried, since the last pony that came back after being banned was immediately banned again.
Welp, too bad for pablez

Oh my.

To be perfectly honest.
Yeah but if they like ponies i wanna be friends
^
If I see some dude I don't know creepin on me and following me everywhere
I usually sit there quietly and occasionally laugh at there jokes
I would ask them to leave also
I'm going to have to ask everypony here to leave.
Well if he's doing nothing more than just coming up and having a conversation, there's no real reason to just be all "Eww, go away."
At: not that you do that
At: Just an example
And you just sit there for 45 minutes with them?
yep
Kinda explains why...
*weird
i dont know wat i could say to them tho
whatre yall talkin about
You could say, "I liek poniez" :3
lol
At something topic related or about school or something
Ask them why they like it and if you should give it a try
^
...
No comment on that lie.
Hmmm. Nah.
The truth, may it spread across the land!
lol i guess i could pretend not to know about it, say i'll give it a go, then the next day know everything
Real men prefer Rarity.
/me is a real men
At not next day, give it time ;-D
/me nods in contentment
At: Make them make you join the herd, then they'll feel acomplished and associate good feelings with you

Pretened you don't know about Ponies?
Blasphemy!
one does not simply pretend he does not know of ponies
That seems dishonest
BOOM HEADSHOT!
Hi everypony.
Honesty is more important than anything else
At you can ask them about their favourite pony
U mean ask "who is best pony?"
lol
:3
I wouldn't do that...
Have you done archery before?
But yeah...
Few times.
Hi!
Best pony, you say?
/me cough Rarity cough
IMO RD is best pony
Well to be honest, if they're really the kind of people you want to hang out with, they won't see you as pointless because you don't draw or write fanfics or anything like that.
after that its a close battle for pinkie/twilight for me
/me sighs
^
mornin everypony :) i leik ze trains
One does not simply say "everypony is best pony"
Since he is made out of everything
^
At: practice? I made a pretty good fic
Well you can if you want to. It just takes practice.
But Rarity is best pony!
brb
PINKIE IS BEST EVERYTHING
