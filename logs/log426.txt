John Laster and others at the top are actually fans of Hayo Miyazaki
you are not supposed to be talking about us
They like the in-universe version of Doctor Who, anyway.
Shamroc awesome :3
6the way you said it sounded like he was a megalomaniac
lol
6anyways I was saying
02I didn't mean it that way LOL
wat
6relevant: disney owns pixar, but Lasseter made it clear that pixar would be its own thing
.
I know Troy would be
dat changeling
02sorry if it sounded like that though :x
Abbed would be a closet Brony
Spell-of-Gaming: Ponies :D

03and I put packing peanuts on top
03Just not going to seal the box until I have the video cable
wat
?
Im turning in. got to get an early start tomorrow - got an email about defective safety harnesses, so I need to go job site hopping to check them all
you can fight like a krogan, run like a leopard, but you'll never be better than Commander_Shepard

Lol
03long story short I'm getting a first-gen PS3 that can play PS2 games and wanted to get rid of my third-gen one that doesn't
02but you won't be watching real HD without a proper cable
03and Aurora was looking to buy a PS3
first real safety inspection job :) glad Im being put to use after those long weeks of OSHA training

SunderlandPony89 - I refuse to watch any of it... the commercials are just...

Twi_Fi: Nooooooo!

Oh, Goddesses, I would cry at a live action Avatar film.
Holy crap.... Dr. Horrible's ending was certainly.... depressing.
My freind thinks im weird for watching mlp, yet he watches level up. Although he isnt much of a gamer
Shizuka - You're absolutly bucking right!

rainbowloyalty, <Moonbase Alpha
I never had this problem before, although I haven't installed a lot of games on my Steam. Just Star Trek Online, Portal and Team Fortress 2.

13that would be why
that's a rare plushy crimsonphoenix
there's now a reason
the original video Shizuka is on moonbase alpha
it's a handmade of course it's rare
13steam accounts are free, but you can't add friends or initiate chats unless you buy something on the account
what plushy? D: I wanna see
Vinyl: Well, I came to the conclusion that would be completly normal for a Brony to feel becasue, what the ponies experience from the show is something that every human desires... and to experience that for themselves, with their own eyes, their own feelings, and being able to actually communicate with them... Its something that just seems, right...
seeya
Okay. What's the server name?
13not sure if that's as simple as putting $5 into steam wallet, but there you have it
so whats this game about?
I'm up and running for this game.

Phase4 : make bronystate text-to-speech please and thanks
Different game? Okay
07SLR/DSLRs use a mechanical flap to control the amount of light that goes into the sensor/film
hey SuperBrony64
Single-lens reflex camera - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera
The historic 1949 Zeiss Ikon VEB Contax S, manufactured in Dresden, the first pentaprism SLR for eye-level viewing. A single-lens reflex (SLR) camera is a .
what are they doing right now?
07in addition to the aperture, etc
03so basically SLR has removable lens, that's the diff?
02yep
07no
So what happened with Spectrum_Rush last night?
i laughed too hard at that, Shizuka
Shizuka has me in fits of laughter
02there's more though
Oh god Shizuka xD
He fess up?
HAHAHAH
God that mousetrap one got me haha. I'm laughing so hard.
me sides hurt
07there are point and shoots with interchangeable lenses
6heheh
6aperture
I WATCH VEGGIE TALES DAMMIT Shizuka
potato
POTATO!!!
DSLRs you are p. much guaranteed like more control like ISO, apeture, shutter, etc
Steedius: dat feel. i know it
I remember Veggietales
GTA moon
hey
XAX: I'm glad I'm not alone. <3
HAHA
I ate veggies.
gta moon??
hahahahaha
im playin with them
PAS can have controls like that, but it's not guaranteed (i look for models that do)
GTA IN SPACe?
epic
Oh god now I'm crying
Oh hey Rocklobster I saw you on the stream
xD
damn you guys!
hahahaha
i left
03so how do you tell the difference just by looking
it got borin
07and the SLR part is the mirror that reflects the light entering the lens over to the viewfinder
DSLRs also may have RAW output mode, raw sensor data, more control, etc
Digitalis: Huh?
<Digitalis> I know dat feeling
PAS almost certainly don't
13wat...
Oh yeah
11,01Lol.
Righit
I was laughing to hard xD
13quit drops you from the game
13that's just dumb
Whoops
runs so slow for me
lol
???
that was fun
can we play somethin like tf2
or l4d2
homage, You are second best OC ever
where is the microsoft sam voice go??
11,01The moon is fun.
or l4d
d'aaaw
That was... a thing
02dSLRs also have focusing points on a reflective mirror that you see when you look through the view finder which are called AF focusing points.
Nittany_Discord, You guys had me in tears
The moon is a desolate wasteland.
that was.....epic XD
07basically if it's a point and shoot, you're looking at a digital display or through just a couple pieces of glass
the moon is awesome
Hmmm...
11,01Try to get into the next game.
DSLRs are usually bigger than PAS
look at some photos of both and you'll see the form difference
do it
Nittany_Discord, I wish I could, but I have school in the morning. Can we do a game tomorrow?
Egad
11,01Oh.
dat RD theme...
RD
Nittany_Discord, Actually I can play one game!
11,01OK.
LETS DO THIS!
11,01Join Bronystate.
LEEEEEROY!
leeeeeeeeeeeeeroooooooooy
11,01PW sillyfillies.
JEEEEEEEEEEEENKINS
Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah!
02They’re a lot faster and have greater accuracy then other methods used by point and shoots
look at my avatar

Wait, what?
1,3that just looks like a really bad plan right there
I'll never be steamfriend with Nittany_Discord :'(
HAHAHAHA
02Also, dSLRs usually have a CMOS censor, which is a lot bigger than CCDs found in point and shoots.
that moonwalk
im sry for u
Actually WATCHING the tutorial?
I'm watching, this time
How do I shot asteriks
Jaketehsnake, use BUNNY HOP everywhere!

*Buy some apples!*
u all obv kno this already but the guy who founded valve and steam he is a brony and so is Notch
Spectrum_Rush: I love that gif.
alexxm: i'm ok.... i woke up sooemthing like 20 mins ago...
:)
00,10Still think Notch is just trolling
03LOL what
02XD
Notch never really said that he is a brony...
11,01But most of the major publishers are akin to record labels and movie studios as they're ruining games to further their control over them.
Just, "I like the show"
dun dun dunnnnn
00,10pssssss Nitt, video ended
Kinda like my situation.
11,01I know.
Idk, Notch wanted to settle a legal issue via Quak deathmatch, seems like a cool guy to me.
Spectrum_Rush: i'm fine! :$

No. Someone found out that the DLC was infact on the disc.
@pony
/me cries
03http://i.imgur.com/GPyKX.jpg
But you needed to download something to unlock it. blah blah blah
@pokemon
10 Meanwhile is a/an 4 Salamence
I don't even know what that is.
00,10Framework for the chracter on the disk
02http://i.imgur.com/WkzuR.jpg
11,01Someone used a code to unlock part of the DLC.
Me neither.
@pony
12Twi_Fi is 12Spit8f7ire
Part?...
Okay
That's better.
00,10yeah the frameworks that tells the game there is DLC charicters
Applejack is the most loyalest of ponies.
That's why she is the element of....
STAN PEE'D!
11,01Argument of early and on-disc DLC is that it's parts of the game removed to milk consumers.
02http://i.imgur.com/97W2e.jpg
dot dot dot
00,10Yeah people complained they removed parts of the game to then re sell them and charge you for data you already had.
/me checks steam
06Seems legit
11,01I won't be surprised if that actually happens.
This here award thingy.
11,01Especially with online passes.
Am I the only one whose stream is lagging a bit?
03so is it better to get like 2 hours of sleep before waking up for the day, or to just stay up?
11,01*sigh*
Some lag.
...
nope Radu i was around the trophey
Damn it...
alexxm: Oh you.
Damn it.
DAMN IT!
00,10Then again I have always thought DLCs suck
what Radu
06red bull
02any amont of sleep unless it's only like a few minutes is better
03no.
Nothing... Nothing :3
03@ energy drinks
11,01Lag.
02amount*
00,10they used to call them expansions
*bleeeeeeeeeeep*
what about stuff like shivering isles Sumica
LOL
That was good.
At the end.
I miss expansion packs.
11,01Me too.
00,10and you got ahell of alot more bang for you buck when it was expansions
haha u guys do u remeber in ep 2 s1 where the mane 6 find out luna is celestias sister and they are all leaning foward and Pinkie falls over?
Nope
14hi :3
02I've pulled a few all-nighters thinking the same before, makes you feel like a dead person all day XD
03exactly
You know?... I REALLY hate EA right now...
/me needs to rewatch episodes.
11,01I miss gaming before publishers starting fucking customers over with DLC and bad DRM.
00,10wth is shivering isles?
03I'm almost done with this paper
/me stares at Twi_Fi
03should be done in less than 15 mins
That revelation was AFTER Pinkie took a nosedive, IIRC.
03and I need to get up at around 7:15-7:30
11,01And abusing licensing.
03it's now 5:00
14I stayed awake for ~35 hours once
14o.o
the oblivion DLC Sumica
Sumica: Expansion to Oblivion.
00,10never played it
NOW that was DLC
11,01And draconian/Orwellian EULAs.
o.o
14I slept for like 16 hours the night after xD
Twi_Fi: watch from 19:52
11,01And online passes.
Prince_Shane: i do.
11,01The last few years of gaming has gone to hell.
Onlines passes piss the HELL out of me...
00,10Supprised no one called me out on haveing me2 dlc's
06my pers. record is around 36 too
03I always sleep for like 12+ hours if I can :P
06slept till 5PM next day O.o
The nice thing about playing WOW is they never ask you to pay for their DLC. Which are called patches.
But Sumica, you have me2 dlc.
Well, I never played any of them, so you're kinda doing me a favor.
14lol
Prince_Shane, nah I remember.
14I don't like sleeping too late
Prince_Shane: i love that scene just 'cause there's luna. it's not that hilarious.
14I love waking up at dawn :D
nah i laughed at pinkie
02If I realize I’ll only get a few minutes sleep, then I’ll go ahead and pull an all-nighter.
11,01Sumica, you can take over if you want.
00,10if it makes you fell better i did't pay for them
00,10oki
Sumica is a thief.
14but Summer pisses me off, because to wake up at dawn I should at 5am <.<
That does make me feel better actaully.
02but I think 1-2 hours is legit
haha Twilights stomach in ep 3 sounds like dubstep
Makes sure that EA doesn't get anymore money than they actually deserve.
11,01I feel better when I don't buy games from EA, Activision, or Ubisoft TBH .
00,10I preffer the term Privater
/me donates money to EA.
11,01Or THQ.
2k all the way!
Ubisoft for me is fine
14I don't trust my brain when it comes to "yeah I'll sleep only for x minutes/hours"
I thought THQ was alright.
14or "I'll just close my eyes"
14:P
11,01Nah.
11,01They use online passes.
02LOL same
Ahhh.
Damn it!
11,01And on-disk/Day 1 DLC.
or is that take 2 now...
02next thing you know
the one thing that pisses me off is when u go to rent a game and u put it in and go play MP and it says u need a online code i end up flipping a couple of tables
11,01THQ is almost dead though.
02brain goes into troll mode
Lol
so long the game is good
Yeah...
Man, I am going to miss Company of Heroes and Dawn of War when THQ goes under.
02"I'm going to sleep for 6 hours instead, you mad?"
I really miss the days when ID was king...
THQ is dieing =( no more saints rows
oh wow
14xD
or Id*
03I can't do that though
Like there needs to be any more Saint's Row.
11,01Saints Row 3 was a blast.
03gotta turn in a paoer at 8, and then I have a midterm at 10:15...
00,10yep shes is allll *bleep*
03*paper
hah
Every time I see gilda I can only think of two words. Fried Chicken.
Saint's Row was pretty cool.
saints rows are so bucking fun
00,10Redfaction killed THQ
kicking people in the balls
02what's your paper about? o.o
One of the few games that could actually be called a game.
Whenever I see Gilda I think eagle lion.
ow
and the awkward moment when ur character does the ball kick animation to a girl
Tourettes Pinkie.
03sociology x.x
00,10Arma
02:x
Ahhh. Indeed.
00,10Gorilla was awsome
THQ is only good for 40K games now
11,01Geurilla was awesome.
Gorilla was freakin awesome.
14well, that's easy
03no it's not
03it's about a book I haven't read

03anyway
00,10I love the sledge hammer
Sumica: would a hostel movie ever be shown on BMN or EMN?
00,10hard to say.
14"WELL IF YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME SUCH A SO HARD PAPER TO DO I'D HAVE GONE OUTSIDE AND MAKE SOME SOCIOLOGY BY MYSELF. THE END"

Scions have such a range it's unreal. And how do those guns even work damnit?

Seduce the queen of the changlings sounds like a plan....
Sumica nu nuke overkill?
*no
Scions are trully OP.
Need the nuke for the next bit.
never acknowledge the glitch Sumica
DISCORD. (I say: IF we win......you must take your sorry a$$ back to Hell........and also you will have to pay OUR rent!!!!)
Dark92Enigma: you said that yesterday
It's ironic that the Scion's giant shoulder is literally full of brain matter but it can't figure out where Shepard is.
Dat irony.
Dark92Enigma: busted.
Scions are limited to bad AI.
obviously it isn't very good brain matter
11,02Night all :D/
but.. its useless if you have so much brain matter yet you never use it

we never see another giant husk in ME3?
i hate that.....THING
Where was Gondor when the proto reaper opened up massive?
Spectrum_Rush pablez94 I TOLD YOU! DISCORD IS BACK!..........
How the hell did human ooze turn into that thing?!
I HATE HIM!!!!!!DISCORD U'LL GOING TO DIE ON MY HAND!!!!!!!!!!!!
and BTW logic, who needs it?
Combined genetic and nano materials Ninjazz.
Ahhhh...
millions?
/me shudders
Cyborgs...
the human race has billions, we can spare a few million
only millions?
WE ARE THE BORG
/me starts tracking da room using magic but cannot find that fucking caos lord
Ninjazz super Cyborgs ^^
Reapers are mechanical, but the 'metal' that builds them is made of organic material taken during that whole blending thing from earlier.
Indeed, Invi.
Spectrum_Rush: I am Locutus of Borg, you will respond to my orders
i wonder how creating metal from flesh works...
Must take ALOT of material to turn into metal.
Well, tens of thousands of humans gets you that far.
DISCORD. If you win the rock off..........then you must take Spike back to hell (Spike: WHAT!?) Me: Trust me, it's the only way....(Spike: what are you talking about?) To be your little BI%&&&&&&&&&!
valoreins: there are a lot of metal in the human body
calcium.. iron, sodium poatssium...
Daayuum.
True, but it isn't just the metal in the body they use
where can I get that Sea Pony Lyra? my Desktop Ponies doesn't have it
Dark92Enigma: r u crazy?!??!??
desktop ponies they kill
with teh cute
it's not a lot but they did use millions of people and thens always the carbon
poniez are evil
pablez94 You never heard Beezleboss? (Tenacious D reference)
i think if it has calcium in that giant thing... should it be look a little... bone-like?
Just some, Invi.
Presumably they knit the base elements of the body into a structured form using the same type of nanomachines that they use for the blending process.
Dark92Enigma: nope.
yah
nprob
Meanwhile, have you.......done this?
seems like it has too much iron in that thing
Ninjazz don't you know the song ''poniez are evil''? ^^
well that's assuming it's calcium phosphate
pablez94 Check it out, you'll see what i'm talking about........
/me stares suspiciously at Meanwhile
I don't believe I do, Invi.
They are an amalgamation of flesh and metal at the very basest state, like melding an alloy to a cell.
is the Japanese one OK?
genetic + destiny = genestiny?
Man and machine meet...
OR REMAIN STANDING
Pinkie is Twitchy
TECHNILOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL
:P
man and machine procreate, result manchine
Hmmm. Someone is eating all the bandwith. Brb

/me keeps focusing

/me *snapflash revives Dark92Enigma *snapflash
That really sucks for the Collector General, it gains sentience again, just in time to have it's face blown off.
uh?
did i do that?
the revives have been doubled?
Did......
Did he do it?
Twi_Fi: who?
Shouldn't have kept the base.
k
Dark92Enigma: are u ok?
Why do I feel that the Illusive Man has his base in that place just so he can use that star as a desktop background?
Cause money can buy anything.
Say it.
Dat Shepard.
OMG
Also hi bronystate.
Dark92Enigma--: answer me!!!!!
Allo FillyFlam.
FillyFlam, welcome.
his eyes...
I love his eyes.
hi FillyFlam
the base was blowed up, so the base can be used as, what? mass to hurl at enemies?
wait.. did the illlusive man already have a Husk eye?
Hi FillyFlam.
pablez94 Yes i am.....but for some reason, after i died, i couldn't go back to my first acccount so i'm using this one
Locutus: didn't blow up, had a radiation wave shot through it. Killed all life in the place.
why did you save the collector base?
Dat Martin Sheen
ohhh
You tell us, you're Commander_Shepard.
lol
He assumed control of me
This bit made my heart leap.

8,1the rush you get when you hear the procession approaching, with everyone costumed and painted and in character, and the drumers drumming, knowing that you are responsible for making sure that the May Queen can lead her procession through the crowd... it's awesome, but also nerve wracking
Sumica

Shepard is overcomed by the situation.
8,1even though I know it's just a performance, when you're out there in the middle of it, Beltane feels so *real*, as if the people taking part really are the spirits that drive the seasons
Shepherd is looking deep into your soul!
He knows not how to react.

Sumica: why banning pablez94 again?
don't abuse it too often ^^
I like the Mica ping more :3
^
Howcome I don't get yayed ? :s
You did.
Knowing his "writing style" I actually think he meant to apologize once or twice, Sumi.
Dat George Takei.
i got a ding not a yay
Don't abuse the pings, that's why some ponies were recently banned.
But the stream is a few seconds off
Oh
Sumica got a special ping system
Yeah, I think he's using mIRC.
Yes, indeedy!
It's probably some strange mod coding voodoo, Gunthler
FillyFlam: Seems legit :D
mfw when we still talk about Sumica
's pings
NOOOOOO
silly fillys he explained the ping thing earlier
Hey, don't look at me, I just got home.
Now, if I'll ever be a mod, I'll put it so the ping sounds like Fluttersquee
Kammerjunk, welcome.
/me looks at Kammerjunk.
Comatose.
O hi, Kammerjunk

How does sumica do the woah? :D
Oh hi.

I feel sorry for the one banned pony.
Anyway, rofl Kammerjunk, that was clever. :D
Why did he/they got banned anyway?
I love GilDash...
Radu, abusing the pings.
Radu: Because ping spams are not magic.
8,1Xera: nothing, just hey
Oh my.
Radu: ping abuse
Oh, hello there.
Radu: Lots of pings
Mica, the laythorugh is like your 5th?
PSA: Ping abuse....it's wrong.
Oh, George Takei. You so silly.
^
Sumica: Sorry about the pings earlier!
and know you know
oh no
/me waits for it.
I knew he was back...
/me oh my
No wrath?
It seems he's a bit preoccupied.
But I surely do need a source on dat tasty "Oh my"
Singularity + Throw = TO THE MOOOOOOOON
I was just worried, since the last pony that came back after being banned was immediately banned again.
ok he save then
Welp, too bad for pablez
Sumica: Thanks!
or whatever
Radu: It's George Takei on a TV commercial.
I forgot the name.
Oh my.
spamtastic
Let us have a moment of silence for pablez.
/me burps
anyone ever had fried spam?
Hmmm. Nah.
lolno
Kammerjunk, that predates his Big Bang Theory "Oh my"?
His spelling was atroshious.
Hey! Anypony recognize this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ALsvU50wQ
You ponies are terrible!
I know Twi_Fi <3
Oh.
:P
Wait, what?
RainbowAsh: Fairly certain, yeah. I can recognise that "OH MY" from anywhere.
Kammerjunk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ALsvU50wQ

Sumica: Hell yeah she did.

Just look at her.
Augmented *Snortsnort*
She didn't ask for this.
Ninjazz: cant regognize her
IKR!

the Reapers must think "Oh it's the Normandy, we should completely ignore her!"

A little laggy here and there.

Slight lag, but better.
Same, but that's normal for me.

This is the only time I have ever done a quick kill.
FALCON PUNCH!

Is that heavy melee thing specifically a biotic power, or do all classes get it?
Um not sure if it's Just Nz but if the Governor general or monarchy is present i think God save the Queen is the anthem to usse.... not sure though
"I think the Alliance sent backup." YOU DON'T SAY.

The hay just happened? Did the game skip forward?

Damn, game, you weird.

Toodles
In other news, Troll 2?!?!? Seriously????
FAILURE
busy drawing 6_9
That bad, Twi_Fi?
Never seen it myself.
Twi_Fi what is troll2?
I'll bbl. Bai.
MFW I read that as Panda.
i hear zecora talking..
Cya RainbowAsh
In school I found a bunch of people that like MLP as well as me so I decided to sit with them. I didn't mention the fact that I to like MLP, I just sat there and talked. They got annoyed and told me to go away. I really want to be friends with them. What should I do?
c ya rainbowA...gone
My life is ruined
Troll 2 is the B movie for movie night.
Tell them you like MLP...
Antrophology isnt updated
:(((((((((((((
Patience, Rodonies.
D:
At: sing random song, just like Pinkie says
XD
yeah, the song always works
^
cat ./Viri > /dev/bag/masterball
I have heard that Troll 2 is really terrible.
so is wrek sober?
At: They seem like kind of a-holes to me.
So, I sad.
To be perfectly honest.
Twi_Fi: if its as bad as the room, itll be fun
Yeah but if they like ponies i wanna be friends
FillyFlam: Depends on what At does when hes near
^
twilight_sprinkle, clips from Troll 2 are often used on youtube like the Room.
Twi_Fi: i kno
If I see some dude I don't know creepin on me and following me everywhere
I usually sit there quietly and occasionally laugh at there jokes
I would ask them to leave also
I'm going to have to ask everypony here to leave.
Well if he's doing nothing more than just coming up and having a conversation, there's no real reason to just be all "Eww, go away."
At: not that you do that
They dont move, they sit down at a table for 45 mins
At: Just an example
And you just sit there for 45 minutes with them?
yep
Kinda explains why...
At when you just sit there with unknown guys and just laugh with them instead of speaking, that appears a bit weitd to them
*weird
i dont know wat i could say to them tho
whatre yall talkin about
/me does ritual to raise bot from the dead.
You could say, "I liek poniez" :3
lol
At something topic related or about school or something
Ask them why they like it and if you should give it a try
Slam your fists down hard against the table and declare the truth, "Twilight Sparkle is best pony!"
^
...
Only spell Rainbow Dash correctly.
I don't want to instantly say i liek ze poniez, i wanna become friends first
No comment on that lie.
At do as if you are a non brony and ask them out about the show, then admit, that you are a brony ^^
Ninjazz: tis the truth
Hmmm. Nah.
Twi_Fi: That wouldn't work
Twi_Fi: Since pinkie is best pony
The truth, may it spread across the land!
lol i guess i could pretend not to know about it, say i'll give it a go, then the next day know everything
Real men prefer Rarity.
/me is a real men
At not next day, give it time ;-D
http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m35mzzPqef1r81w4ho1_500.png C'teno is Double!
Rarity is my 2nd fav, but Twi is my fav
/me nods in contentment
At: Make them make you join the herd, then they'll feel acomplished and associate good feelings with you
^
:3
At and don't just sit there and laugh ^^
I wouldn't like to have to pretend not to know the show and start from scratch tho
I totally should become a shrink, you know
shrink = psycharatist?
Oh well, Back to tending my fluttershy on my minecraft :3
yes
k
@pony
/me fails
Pretened you don't know about Ponies?
Blasphemy!
i see them drawing pictures of ponies and theyre really good at it so if i said that i just watch the show and nothing more they might feel as if im pointless
one does not simply pretend he does not know of ponies
That seems dishonest
BOOM HEADSHOT!
Sounds like a tight knit group, At.
Hi everypony.
When my friends bring up bronies, I tend to play dumb.
Honesty is more important than anything else
Hi BronyJenkins.
BronyJenkins, welcome.
At you can ask them about their favourite pony
So in other news, I'm going to go do archery-stuff.
U mean ask "who is best pony?"
lol
:3
I wouldn't do that...
Have you done archery before?
who are we talking about anyway
But yeah...
Few times.
At no, who is FAVOURITE pony ^^
The students asked teh Buddha, "Who is best Pony?"
Hi!
Best pony, you say?
LiquidFire, welcome.
Best pony is Badass Twilight
Hi LiquidFire.
/me cough Rarity cough
IMO RD is best pony
Well to be honest, if they're really the kind of people you want to hang out with, they won't see you as pointless because you don't draw or write fanfics or anything like that.
after that its a close battle for pinkie/twilight for me
/me sighs
Randomnerd and the budda answered everypony is best pony
^
/me why its me obviously
Invi: Congratulations, you have acheived nirvana, :)
Vinyl Scratch is best pony.
yh but i wish i could draw awesome pics or write good fanfics rather then just like the show
mornin everypony :) i leik ze trains
Discord is best everything
One does not simply say "everypony is best pony"
Since he is made out of everything
Attention! Attention! Twilight Sparkle is best pony!
^
At: practice? I made a pretty good fic
Randomnerd but I like being alive :(
Well you can if you want to. It just takes practice.
But Rarity is best pony!
brb
At: what says you cant do the same?
PINKIE IS BEST EVERYTHING
Hi guys! :3

But clearly demoting someone else's favorite by saying "X pony is best pony" is clearly insensitive.
YAY Fallout 3
I might go to school with bubbles and walk around like a tortoise all day
THE X-PONIES
