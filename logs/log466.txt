Well, the least I can do is download this torrent myself. I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't.
this guy sounds just like the battlecruiser portrait in StarCraft
Is anyone else getting some sort of error on the IRC?

"In ancient Greek mythology, Europa was a Phoenician princess whom Zeus abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull. He took her to the island of Crete where she gave birth to Minos, Rhadamanthus and Sarpedon. "
CupcakeWarrior: I switched to Iris
Ahhhh
WindWhistler: Try updating flash
If that were the case, the stream wouldn't be working either.

GOD DAMMIT LITWICK. WHY AE YOU LOOKING AT THE TEARJERKER PAGE.
All hands to lead-sheilded safe areas
Is the streamer accepting requests for anime to stream?
If you want to see tragedy, this whole dub is a tragedy.
oh Hi chef
/me drinks Litwick's tears
/me has some good anime in mind
dat dialogue....
If you know what I mean
Why...so...idiot...
Oh...my...
.............O U
oh u
lol..
UUUUUUUUUUH
that laugh
xD
uhuhuhuhuhuh
Wind_Whistler: I have some suggestions for some anime too.
That sly dog him ;)
Oh you
yeah just sit on my lap like this
00,10and this Tragedy of a dub had a big part in why anime became popular in the states
Wait, what kind of stupid laugh was that...:D
THATS WHAT SHE SAID
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Kandarihu: I wasn't expecting destroyed earth, I was just hyperbolizing. I dunno if you could tell, but I wasn't being serious.
Sumica: I thought that was Akira?
Visuals and stuff, and story has a good pace.
Sumica: doesn't make it a good dub.
Wow Sumi
./* Swag Swag Swag Swag ./*
Sumica: xD
BRB going to search for something edible in the kitchen :P
Litwick : http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Boatmurdered
Sumica: we should watch garceys wing once..
Guys
I am the night http://i.imgur.com/c2aDy.jpg
00,10no anime before 97 was a good dub
It's hard to debate with people who aren't being serious.
the Sage says you're not an anime fan unless you've seen Akira...
Kandarihu i've seen tragedy in animes like the original Saint Seiya....so i know tragedy........What kind of tragedy, btw?
/me slaps Airpuff
Sumica: OY NO YOU DIDN'T!
CupcakeWarrior: D:
Sumica: Sailor Moon!
Tragedy = Grave of the Fireflies
DB-DBZ!
00,10it was a terable dub.
"Did I mention he is on fucking fire!?"
everypony im gonna go out to dinner soo yeah be gone till i get back
Kandarihu: in the future, please note that the grammatical correctness and vocabulary level of my posts are directly proportionate to my sincerity.
Sumica It was decent, which is alot better then most.
WindWhistler: Im an anime fan, and I havent seen it
CupcakeWarrior: Same here. Just saying what the Sage said.
Not sure if I'll remember.
dat shocked face.
Very few dubs were truely good in terms of voice acting.
Sumica: Now I feel like going through all dubs in the 80s and 90s just to find ONE example. :P
That is quite possibly the best hyperspace sequence I've seen in a good while.
Immediately now or later now?
Dat blue guy sounds like he's speaking through a microphone...
If Kinnikuman would have made it to the US....it' would've been a hit
.........this anime is weird
Dark92Enigma: intact?
00,10then again we probably use diffrent critiera of good.
Dark92Enigma: There is Ultimate Muscle....
Kandarihu: dubs in any language tend to suck.
lol...
MACROSS ISLAND?!
Which I think is some sort of spinoff
Woah...
Since the guy looks exactly like Kinnikuman
why does the black chick have the least detailed eyes?
im back with oreos!!
WELCOME TO FUCKING BOATMURDERED!
"Its covered with ice captain."
xD
xd
WindWhistler I've seen it, and it's a sequel to the original
Okay, I gotta admit, that's a pretty cool idea. :)
00,10yeah alot of them
Sure no masterpiece though
pyrocatboy: mwahaha
Airpuff: Yeah, now my haying windshield is blocked with ice.
Still a better love story than Twilight
why are their hairs floating?
Tend to. But Cowboy Bebop and FLCL go against the trend.
ummmm.... wat is this?
"We're dying, so romantic"
TheRainbowDash: xD
isnt hostility romantic?
...
lol
ARE....YOU...FUCKING...IDIOTS?!!?
UH OH

DuskStarshimmer: you tell ME, PRINcess.
HHAHAHAHAHAHA

FLCL is... interesting.
XD
My ears are bleeding
>_> Yeah maybe in a book
Riiight.
that was in a han solo voice, in case you couldn't tell DuskStarshimmer
He's got swagger.
Did he just....poke her silt?
HELLO EVERYPONY! :)
my bleeding are ears
You'know.. all english dubs.. are just so........ so.... just so..
Hi Ponies47
Kandarihu intact?
Ohai Ponies47

Airpuff: Some are hilarious
WindWhistler: most of them sound terrible
So wazzup?
Airpuff: try watching a spanish dub, they're a million times worse
Airpuff: That's what makes them hilarious
I dont normally say hi to people, but when i do its you, Ponies47!
If you want an example of "Being so bad it's good", GTO. XD
Do you think Kinikkuman could make it to the U.S. without being heavily edited like Dragonball Z?
DuskStarshimmer: han solo. of the han dynasty.
rdibp: YAY! How come? :)
Airpuff The dub for Black Lagoon is awesome.
you know.
Kandarihu: nope
china.
do you know that meme?
pyrocatboy: yeah, one of the good ones.
LAUGH BECAUSE WE'RE ALIVE
why all the hooks?
WindWhistler btw Ultimate Muscle is good.....but some characters name (dub change name) left me uneasy to say the least
do these people laugh at everything?
WindWhistler: Laugh because we almost died!
its a carneval Mr. Krabbs
HAHAHHA NO!!! Y U LAUGHING?
Laugh in the face of DEATH!
I'm a purist. EVERY character name change for dubs leaves me uneasy to say the least.
00,10Computer......plot?

/me laughs in the face of DEATH
pluto a planet?
oh captain my captain
This captain is scary xD
:P

!pokemon
/me starts sobbing, "I dont know these referances"
lol cachi01 xD
why are their only women on the bridge, except the captain? ~.~
brings cachi01 back to life
Dark92Enigma: Considering all the other anime they showed had so much to censor out
^w^
ekips: Best Crew Design ever.
YES!
HAHAHAHAHHA
ekips: the capt is a pimp
DuskStarshimmer: (big mac voice) you oughta be ashamed of yerself
Yu-Gi-Oh....One Piece...

Ponies47: thx :D

We're lost in spaaaaaaaaaaaace

/me sobbs harder
WindWhistler yes.....probably the ONLY good thing 4kash ever did......

cachi01: no prob *hugs*
Oh yes...hug each other...now smell her a little
Petrified_Discord: DANGER WILL ROBBINSON, DANGER!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Why did 4kids pick up shows that they would have to waste money censoring?
WindWhistler: I heard a very hard-to-believe rumor that 4Kids presented an F-Zero anime intact.
Like a baws.
thanks Sumica!
omg..
hey we wanted to see what happens next episode
lol
WindWhistler: trolling us?
00,10muhahahaha now you have no idea what is next
star wars?

Sumica: Which is good. :P
WindWhistler.....btw Kid Muscle is VERY similar to a certain WWE Superstar
Sumica: WHY DO YOU TAUNT US?!
Sumica: Lord of the Rings?
Its like a nex experance this time

Sumica: Is this the last one planned for tonight 4 in a row is quite a handful.
i liked kid muscle...
How many eps will we be streaming tonight?
no Next episode preview?
Irish_Pony: Remember spiderman?
00,10yeah
over 9000
Dark92Enigma: I think that should be the other way around. Remember, it's never Japan that makes things similar to other countries.
Guys, my day's not going so hot. Help me out?
sumica stream 60's spiderman
my day is over
Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
this intro... xD
And honestly...It's not a bad anime, I enjoy the pace, the action is decent, the characters are so animish, and the graphics isnät BAD at all!
MASTER SPAAAAAAARK

TheGreatAndPowerfulT... T what... WHAT!???
I'm dealing with it, it's AWESOME so far! 6/10
There's thunder storms here :'(
Sumica: Thats fine, its not that bad for its age.
inb4 someone complains that Sumica called it a cartoon
IT'S AN ANIME :P
WindWhistler how about Kevin Mask......(sarcastic tone) I wonder which wrestler it was based upon.........

I also love this cartoon :3

00,10tit's been ameracanised, it's a cartoon
Cartoon anime what's the difference
.. thats bad.

I liked the 3rd pokemon movie best
First animation of any kind you ever saw?
Dark92Enigma: Well, I actually don't watch Kinnikuman or Ultimate Muscle...
no
CupcakeWarrior: I liked the manga the best.
rdibp dunno, i have asked that question too
Anime can be anime for it's style, cartoon can be cartoon too if cartoomed. :P
00,10that I recall
CrimsonPhoenix: there is no difference, thats the joke.
I LOVE THAT GUY'S MOUSTACHE
STOOPID
WindWhistler However, John Cena was ABOUT to be the V.A. for Kid Muscle
DAFUQ ^

Dark92Enigma: Cena, BOOOOOOO~
Rick field...? You mean RIck hunteR?
Dark92Enigma: I have no idea who that is. :|
Dark92Enigma: i loved kid muscle but JOHN CENA VA?

Cirno is not as much of an idiot as everyone makes her out to be
She just has a one-track mind...

Cirno had a game where she even FORCED Marisa to give up...
just like any other child
DO NOT MISTAKE HER POWER
She is Nr 1 for a reason
Their actually transmitting tactical data on unencrypted channels? we should sshow them who thier dealing with - Cortanna

There is a unicorn on the annoying orange show
Vordox: They had a tie actually
She just touched it again didnt she?

cachi01: it's from the manual for Phantasmagoria of Flower View. A diagram of the HUD had 9 points on it, outlining various indicators. The 9th icon pointed to Cirno and was labelled as baka.
Creepy..

She's smarter then she looks Sumica. :P
WHOAAAAAAAA
HEElloooooo Minmay

THIS WAS A KID'S ANIME?
Next episode: Water shortage

why does a shump have a storyline?
lol
Buffer
y u no go naked
its about dat curtain, not story.
Dat dialogue >.>
.......showering in who knows what...?
When did that become unacceptable :(?
sumica do that thing again
They heavily edited this anime but they didn't do anything about the fanservice. I find that ironic.
...
WallDives: Because Japanese games must have a story
portions!
nd dat yay
Minmay reminds me of Pinkie Pie, but mre mellow..... <.< HOLY CRAP
00,10suddnly she is smart
Then again, I don't remember that from Toonami.
Im surprised Touhou 14 hasnt been announced yet
00,10she thinks to save the food
Nature scout?...
there is soo much nature on this ship
in space
in SPACE
WindWhistler: I retort with almost every other fighting game and shump made in japan, made by Cave, Treasure, or Capcom (in fighters).
seems legit
CupcakeWarrior: just give it 7 months
CupcakeWarrior: Apparently Reimu and Marisa aren't gonna be playable characters anymore...
CupcakeWarrior: im sure it will be annoounced
Okei.. seriously... wtf....
00,10btw that was the reactor coolent water pipe
WindWhistler: What makes you say that?
I remember they painted swimsuits on all of the nude scenes of Outlaw Star and Tenchi Muyo. I'm not a fan of nudity, so I liked that.
WindWhistler: WTF WHY?
Sumica: Figured...
Whoho, radiation poisoning.
Well then again, the date that news was released was on April 1st.....
omg
SPAAACE RAAAATS
xD
but it seems like the Japanese fans are buying it...
WindWhistler: oh god true or false?
WindWhistler: You scared me for a second
^
SPACE SPACE
00,10quick, molest her
So much lag
cachi01: Well, with all the Japanese fans on board, I'm a little nervous
needs more space core
Star trekin' across the universe. *sings*
00,10woops scoots steped on the remot
Org.. i mean Ordeal
They will come super close!
Just like Burnie Burns. Can fall alseep anywhere in seconds
Airpuff: Its getting so close to your faveorite day!
Om: i know.
Om: ?
Biglaw and Bronysith: finished the 2nd chapter. I was also doing some of my homework, so that is why I finished it so late.
Om: but i dont mind tuesday tomorrow though ;)
"The Long Wait" Sounds exciting!
Airpuff: ...why
WindWhistler: last touhou i got was unthinkable natural law am i missing 1??
Holy crap, I finished the annoying orange show, and I am still alive!
Yes, I'm a purist who, nonetheless, doesn't mind seeing stuff like that censored. But I can't stand it when violence is toned down or names or music are changed. If I sense any sign that the script is anything less than a faithful translation, I sweat.
WallDives: Airpuff dislikes tusedays...Normaly
00,10you want to help me scrach the pain on your plane?
Om: cuz i aint got band practice xD
00,10Paint*
How...do you count day witout sun, Sumica?
ITS FRIDAY FRIDAY

I'm so glad there's a likable tengu now...
her eyes are like the udnerground ponies of g1
WindWhistler: thx going to download it now
Exotic kind
Ten Desires was WAY too easy
Airpuff: Ah yes, the Trumpet I assume -_-
CupcakeWarrior: WHAT
Om: Wanna blow it? ;)
xD
CupcakeWarrior: I STILL CAN'T BEAT IT
SBL28
CupcakeWarrior: But I get the feeling that it's because the fps rate is 61 instead of 60...
Phantasmagoria of Flower View is the only Touhou game I ever beat. And I kind of cheated to pull it off.
WindWhistler: By that, I mean it is easy on the easy difficulty
build a city inside a ship?
Ever since we went from XP to Windows 7, I haven't been able to beat any of the regular Touhou games...
Kandarihu: i've only beaten lotus flower story
....
You mean Lotus Land Story?
no kidding!
DEEEEEEEEEERP
xD
WindWhistler: IN was the easiest imo
Kandarihu: yeah that fail xD
Airpuff: I cant think of a witty retort -_-
CupcakeWarrior: I thought PoFV was the easiest
Om: I thought so xD
ohno, give the airlock controls to the dumb girl
For a little while? xD

00,10and heres why
Final episode guys =3

Mark Hamill? geez, he's taken a blow since Star Wars.

Brony is a uni-sexual term
SparklyWaffles: o___o
SparklyWaffles: i usually do that into a napkin...
Rainbow: From a YTP. You'll see that video if you stick with the stream long enough.
hey |Discord| i got a strange shortstop ;p
but everyone at my school defines it by gender D:
party soft :)
Rainbow: somebody said flutershys emo
FlareChaser|Assassin: How about....non
SparklyWaffles: Stay outta mah shed...
In english, the male terms also serve as the gender neutral equivalents (because our language lacks it) - therefore "bro" includes sisters.
Nittany_Discord: I think that when no one is streaming you guys should play some sort of Pony fan music. Only because this morin no one was streamn for a long time.
/me hugs Mish, Your a brony to mee
Our streamers are pretty fond of it. XD
CrimsonPhoenix: yes :|
FlareChaser|Assassin: some rammstein, korn or juds priest
*hugs back*
lol
cachi01: good idea.
shame on mishs school
Also FlareChaser|Assassin Your waifu would be disapointed
When I see this, I am reminded of the final chapter of "World of Ponycaft", in which we learn that FLuttershy is a resto druid partly because she wants to help her friends with her healing-- but mostly because she really wants to be a tree.
ehh i party harder X)
yae

Well, a guy calling himself a brony is a brony. A girl calleing herself a brony is a brony. A girl calling herself a pegasister is a brony called a pegasister. And a guy calling himself a pegasister is... slightly off, but love and tolerate anyhow. :P

re use moar animation
I'd settle for a virtualization machine, Shizu. Virtualize me into Guild Wars 2 and just leave me there.

NO NOT MY FIRE D:
13DaringDude: the wings are much smoother, it's just stream is compressing it out
oh okee
Admittedly, an attack that requires shouting out its name is kind of a useless attack because it gives the opponent time to react.
>_>
let the boys get themselves stupidly killed, you're useless in a fight anyway
lol
that makes sense
9/10 arrows available
mips is working amazing today with me
:O AWEESOME
TROL
13and actually that's much more impressive cause it means stream rate is catching freeze frames as though they were real wings beating, that's pretty awesome

I love throwing parties at Yumi <3
13of course they come close every episode
derp
yes
13but no, no character is killed off
Litwick and that's how ''A Simple Wish'' was made!
hi
why does everyone but Aelita get destroyed in the virtual world? What happens if Aelita finds the tower and saves everyonne, yet people are still around in the virtual world?
Ooh Eeh Ooh Ah Aah Ting Tang Walla Walla Bing Bang! :P

00,10I figured it all out they are in teh computer so it's nano time
ya cus zana wont hert flutershy
Shimmer: muhhaha :D
13Woodenfan: generally the heroes get derezzed before aelita sets the tower, but otherwise the mechanics of the reset button are such that they go to where they were at the start of the loop
fail
Also why kill Yumi? He should kill Odd.
YES, Ami
?
13so they'd derez and be back at school or whatever
lyoko

You may fire (again) when ready
oh THATS how lazors work
That wouldnt stop the lazer!!!!! It was already shot!!! :D
reuse!!!
13yeah, season 1 lacks an overall arc
Lasers work EXACTLY like this
13it'll pick up though
......how can you stop a laser after it's already fired?
lol
EVERYTHING IN THIS SHOW IS 100% ACCURATE.
Shizuka does it get better?
That's what she ----OH COME ON!
WindWhistler: magic

dis is a good video

Aw shit
WindWhistler: They can't until Xana is is stopped. WHY that is, who knows?
I saw this again lol
lol
best movie
13WindWhistler: it's later revealed that jeremie activated the supercalculator and woke xana and aelita up, xana promptly got to world domination
bad ass
guys what's your favorite manga?
this is epic
I could so see it being turned into a movie.
Dark92Enigma: Ooh Eeh Ooh Ah Aah Ting Tang Walla Walla Bing Bang! :P
lol
None as I don't read Manga
I can imagine a real movie being made.
13but it also caused our heroes to meet each other, so they'd rather just defeat xana than go to before they knew each other
oh ok thanks Shizuka.
no i no like sun
i like night
but they seem to retain their memories...
friendship is worth possibly dooming world
Ponies47 Call The Witchdocter!
lol
Witchdoctor*
I think my favorite 3 are Fairy Tail, One Piece, and KHR, in that order.
so couldn't they still be friends then too?
13but also it typically seems the reset button only has a range of maybe a day or two
NI
Dark92Enigma: lol :P
ok Shizuka, does that get abused at one point?
Shizuka: Besides, if they hadn't met, Jeremy would have prolly found the darn thying and there'd be nothing to stop Xana.

Why do I hear Haruko making weird noises in the background?
Shizu: *patpat* That's normal for Comcast.
Shizuka - do you have any options other than Comcast?
Sounds like their having sex
he had a brow job
13dialup
TABITHA? AT EVERFREE NORTHWEST?
But I have no MONEY
EVERY noise Haruko makes is wierd.

I'm not livin in the northwest, IM IN NORTHEAST BEETCHUZ
11,01Shamroc: I'm lacking some food.
13satellite is twice as expensive at a quarter the speed
Nittany_Discord: here have a holograpghic meatloaf
Sumica Do they show the..."That" scene about his dad in the mind...or they removed that in the anime?
Shizuka - and infinitely more reliability
that head
Sumica they do
13less
Vordox: they do
yae
7.59 pm. 1 minute to go.
wait
Seriously that's like THE FIRST big event that Tabitha will attend
but less
13since satellite fails if there's a cloud in the sky
Comcast works fine for me. The Xfinity service is pretty reliable.

CupcakeWarrior: I'm probably going to have multiple fangasms while reading this. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS TO RELEASE

I swear. Every time I use chopsticks, I have to learn as if I never used them before.
i learned to eat with chopsticks a bit quickly o.o

PLOT
AAAH A LIGHTNING JUST STROKE
0,14I think this is a Getter Robo reference
ok
/me is comepletely freakin' lost.
0,14well, the design of human!Atomsk
SaxyPretender: I think he's Lordgenome, personally.
Again, why do people find this show confusing, they explain the plot quite well
0,14...works for me XD
ok
Sumica: Is there a hidden meaning to this show?
no
It's 11:01 here. Bed? Nah to early :)
no
CupcakeWarrior: Drugs are fun
mitamaking: because they waited until the very last episode to explain anything
yay
yay :)
nom nom
yay
Well timed yay
0,14well, you gotta let go sometime
It would be too boring if everything is explained from the beginning.
That crunch is absolutely brutal, somehow.
Explain is a rather... generous term.
dat yay lol
NO
There's no mystery if everything is given right off the bat.
this scene

Ouch
owww
wtf lol
wthf
lol
0,14XD
11,01SunderlandPony89: Was showering.
But frankly, I'd appreciate if the big explanations came in the middle. Like, spending half the story with mystery. And after the big reveal, have enough time to see what the protgonists do with their knowledge.
O__O
WTF
O__O
name sake
0,14sheild your eyes kids

O+o
that 4th walll

Nittany_Discord: Ah. Well, I have a video that you're gonna LOVE http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-LE0ycgkBQ&list=PLD03DDFBA7359DF71&index=28&feature=plpp_video
Ha! That's funny.
0,14SunderlandPony89, no video links during stream =P
oh goodbye fourth wall, nice seeing you
dat plot
And I thought Pinkie broke the 4th wall enough.
11,01SunderlandPony89: Seen it.
Samsa: I know, I know, but I had to post that at least once
The fourth wall exploded
0,14dat X3 face
The fourth wall has been smashed to dust and pissed on.
The perfect ending. =3
ewwww
Pinkie is JEALOUS.
The fourth wall was torn down early. I think only Naota still thinks it's partially there
Kencolt: Nah, Pinkie wrote this show.
Nittany_Discord: I thought of you as soon as I watched it, so I just had to let ya see it :P
00,10Pinkie is haruko
0,14O_O
You're father
00,10just she looks this way in this universe
0,14never thought about that...
raep
Sumica: O____O Suddenly, everything makes SENSE.
rape
-3-
Sumica: seems legit
D:
00,10why do you think I pointed out her pink hair
11,01EA isn't the only company I hate for ruining gaming.
Guitars crossed. Symbolic?
aww dat hug
0,14awww
Nittany_Discord: whos next?
0,14he missed her ;___;
YAY
That bond...
Well I know FLCL was required viewing for all Avatar the Last Airbender workers, I wonder if it is for MLP: FiM
Reikim: Not nearly as much as what's to come.
11,01There is no "next."
Kencolt: True dat.
Nittany_Discord: Well yeah, but they're the worst in my opinion
Is it tuesday morning? Is the disaster coming?
Nittany_Discord: I hate EA too :|
What disaster?
puppy
dem eyes
...OH FU
and yeah dem eyes
ok
SunderlandPony89: the great pony war
You know what's amazing about this series? Despite all the craziness, this is still a coming of age slice of life story. It has something for the people who only care about the intangibles.
11,01I hope you're not buying EA games then.
Why, yes. SHe HAS gone batchit crazy mode.
jpan
StupidSexyCJ: HORY SHEET :P
:O
Kandarihu: This show is life in a nutshell. Crazy, but in the end worth every second.
socks
:O
00,10So gunbuster or diebuster......
lips
Sumica: Gunbuster hands down.
I think FLCL is overrated but nice
Sumica: The trailer! =3
Dat Ass
oh dear
lol
Reikim: indeed
0,14it is, SunderlandPony89
nice car
Nittany_Discord: I hope that EA isn't publishing Lollipop Chainsaw or The Witcher 2 then
lol
Diebuster... is that also by Gainax? I know Gunbuster is.
right hand drive car on top of that
Gunbuster is, in my opinion, far superior to Diebuster
Lollipop Chainsaw is EB Games
11,01Gamers that buy from companies that they hate don't deserve to complain because they are part of the problem.
Kandarihu: It's the sequel.
er, left hand i mean
*WB Games
00,10Die buster is gun buster 2
Ah, okay
I want Lolipop Chainsaw for some reason
CupcakeWarrior: Tara Strong
...
Oh god
CupcakeWarrior: You want to listen to Twilight talking like a Valley Girl.
You know what I hate? .....Skyrim.
That symbolism Sumica...
If the reviews for Lollipop Chainsaw turn out favorable I'm gonna pick the game up
ok
Size doesn't matter.
I just want it because it looks silly
She's got a naruto stuck on her face.
I have Lollipop Chainsaw reserved, but I like No More Heroes
00,10takes a long time to get to england in a rowboat Reikim
ok
Heh
/me 's favorite game is probably WoW right now..
Sumica: ...Trying to figure that one out...nope, nothing.
http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120325180216/sonic/images/5/5c/Mordecai_and_rigby_y_u_no.png
meh fav game is AC
00,10you said size dont matter.
00,10I gave and example where it does
Animal Crossing or Assassin's Creed?
Sumica: Oh! I was referring to the whole soup-size thing on the episode.
mitamaking: The latter.
This show is insane
ewwIT HUNGERS
Yeah. She's gone nuts.
that cig
This scene is really disturbing in a way.
Let's go find the neeext one
lol
Reikim: This whole show is disturbing
CupcakeWarrior: Except where it's just insane.
She has no real idea tat she's going to destroy the world...

There's a serenity to this song as well. I'd say the usage of it makes it epic.

0,14I Think I Can
I think I can!
Im guessing that was symbolic somehow?
COME HERE NAAOTOOOO!
CupcakeWarrior: Everything in this show is symbolic.
00,10her comes the chills
Epic song!
I put toothpaste on my nipples.
Duel Wielding guitars
00,10every time I see this bit
00,10I get chills

Pirate King, He isn't Luffy
dual wield. win.
Wait how did he get the powers?

This show makes no damn sense

I THINK I CAN
Total Eclips of the heart is playing on the wadio

And which part of Atomask CHOSE HIM does she not understand? Like anything here is understandable.
0,14and this part <3

suddenly everyone came!
bye world
0,14notice his nose ring
lol
steal all the things
and then the world exploded
:O

I dont see how anything that happens in this show is symbolic
0,14it is
The world exploded from the massive climax
0,14trust me
So awesome, he creates his own gravitational field.
fark i need to download that touhou torrent before it gets replaced
wow
0,14the nose ring on Atomsk is like the bracelet Haruko wears
or hmm, maybe i'll just wait
Gainax animes always defy the rules of physics
And that is symbolic how?
Most animated things do
CupcakeWarrior: most animes seem to lol
what a trip
whats trhis show calld
It is him becoming a man
geeky-brony: FLCL
0,14this is FLCL, geeky-brony
geeky-brony: Fooly Cooly(FLCL)
CupcakeWarrior: We're not sure. It probably involves Freudian psychology or something.
thax
Yeah probably
0,14and has been said, this show is a big metaphor about growing up
lol
How Saxy?
SaxyPretender: Along with a couple of other things, I'm sure.
00,10the action is jut to smoot it out
11,01Too bad he doesn't get his brain back.
I see now
0,14despite Naota trying to act mature, he never really does
Nittany_Discord: those things are useless anyway
Everything's OK everybody! I have my guitar!
0,14growing up has a lot to do with coming to terms with the world around you
11,01But you need a brain to live.
00,10he has a brain
SaxyPretender: And knowing exactly who you are.
0,14^
If our world was this weird it would be more fun to become a man
0,14bingo
poor guy being a kid nd all
ok
>Nothing amazing happens
Afternoon everyone :3
00,10it's just spread along the side of his skull
>Bullshit
His brain is on the other side of the N.O. tunnel. And I guess it always will be.
afternoon XAX!
Hello XAX
plonk.
How can he say that nothing ever happens?
0,14dat sad note
o hai XAX
11,01I actually remember that (ignored).
Well that was...... something
such a gewd anime
good afternoon everypony
Hey hey hey XAX
Ride on Shooting Star is still my favourite ending theme of all time.
/me glomps DeathStar
11,01Too bad he never gets his head fixed then.
afternoon DeathStar!
Gainex makes the most *bucked* up animes
Afternoon DeathStar
0,14I always interpret that note as her maybe coming back soon
What a climax
Hey hey hey DeathStar
0,14Yeah yeah yeah, Ride on Shooting Star
dat engrish
0,14kokoro no koede
SaxyPretender: This anime is the best kind of anime. Where you keepp wishing it could go on, but you know that it doesn't need to.
SaxyPretender: That if it did, it would ruin it.
0,14so true
0,14it's kinda like life, i guess
Reikim: I don't know, I think a little more may work
I dont like this anime because nothing is ever explained, and none of it makes any sense whatsoever
SaxyPretender: True dat. Nothing lasts, but while it does, it's a blast.
Welp I think I'm gonna go to bed. GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY! :)

Night night Ponies47.
lols
0,14thanks, Sumica

Sumica: I don't agree. Most anime is based on a manga, and many of them end well before the manga does.
00,10no prob SaxyPretender
wat
mmmmmmm burritos
0,14now, I shall brb, for it is shower time
lol
I hate places like this...
Sumica: Man, you just brought back some of my best memories. Good night, and thanks so much.
00,10that's because anime can be produced faster then mangas and they run out of story to copy
00,10so they make up an ending that never fits
Sumica: that's why there's filler.
lol
And then the ending of the anime gets f'ed up
lol

It's like a switch. You EXPECT the fuzzing off, and wavery stuff you see so often in TV and Movies-- but what really happens is it's one moment, the surgeon is saying to relax and the next moment that you know about you're in a different room instantly-- like someone changed the channel.

To be honest, I like Annoying Orange, but making it into a show in Cartoon Network is going waaaaaay too far.
I don't mind Spike :)
00,10I meen there is a reasion they say a car has like 500 horse power
Spitfire, not a good elper
Sumica: how can a car have horse power?
Night guys, I gotta head out!
00,10cause it has the same power of 500 horses
Sumica: cars powered by ponies? XD
Why not OVER 9000!?!
ok
:P
gnight SunderlandPony89! sleep well!
Sumica: yes, but that means a car is equivalent to 500 horses. how can a pegasus be equivalent to more than two pegasi wings?
Over 1000 wing power, 20 ponies missing, can't make 600, what?
1,3wing power is a common misconception of feather power
no

This is the only game where you can do the 2 player games with one person
Since you hold each controller in 1 hand
ok
SuperBrony64:
considering the food they give you I think it's a good deal

03how do you learn? I think you either like it or you don't o.o
you have to learn to withstand the flavor
03that being said

start small and work your way up
milk actually helps somewhat with that
03I also can't eat food right out of the oven like some people can
SuperBrony64: dats shoo cute

11,02But I'm not SB ): I'm his sister.
11,02Be nice to me. lol
i have so many tabs open
oh shnap
The ORIGINAL version of this was one of the first video games I've played.
i needs him to do somthing for me
I've never played this :I
Weegee
/me puts on hipster glasses
yoshi put on a few pounds
I've played the original version of this before the PS and N64 came out
I call bullshit. It's IMPOSSIBLE to get to 1st place on the first lap in this.

I never played the SNES mario kart

Mfw people still think that's how the theatres work.
Terraria server is back up for those interested. =3
Meanwhile: rofl, ikr? :D
geeky-brony: silly new person it's the same in all theatures
geeky-brony: it's the same
nope nuthing in the other thitr
Meanwhile its not all that funny
ok
it saddens me to see someone like geeky-brony, who thinks each theatre is different
geeky-brony: that's not how they work....
we should distribute information
^
geeky-brony all theatres have the same stream and chat
Rain: It saddens you to see new peeps?
thats creepy
even i knew that when i first got on
but they auto join different rooms when they are busy
im new here this is only my secont time on
obv
PM me if you want to joint the fresh server. =3
no, it saddens me to see people who dont realize that the chat client and the stream are in no way connected
That's a fair point.
whwhwhwha
the chat isnt part of bronystate. it is from ponychat.net
rilly
But a lot of the folks who wind up here haven't seen ponychat before.
i havent
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gvjHGJEe0
bronystate just has a few channels set up on ponychat.net and the chat client that is embeded in the site auto connects to those channels
I want Silverscreen's trivia back.
ok
Und on that note, it's actual bus time.
See you folks later.
bye ^_^
bye Meanwhile
later
Meanwhile: Ponies.

say again?
to your what?
oh bog
*bag
^
that
I found...2 and only cause I got them into it XD
and i got a pair of headphones that i can put my own picture in the side of, so i have rainbow dash's cutie mark on the sides
that's...interesting. What headphones are they?
google "phillips design your own headphones"
SHL8800
cool
not that it would help me, I can't wear headphones at work
BBL, tea time
inb4 stream
who would be streaming?
none of the streamers are awake/available
If i didnt have a 128kbps upload speed, i'd happily bribe someone to give me the stream key and keep you people entertained at this hour ^_^
XAX it ant gonna work
XAX, sorry, doesnt work that way
I know :l
I was being silly
/me can hear the crickets chirping in here
ahhh~~~
such a good sound~~~
hello?
http://9gag.com/gag/4198921?ref=featured
lol, 9gag
there. have fun
This~ This right here, when the chat is quiet, this is why I joined that other channel. For more of this~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`
but they also know how to hold long conversations too
What channel is this?
I will not say
:<
You arent in another channel on this network :<
/me whispers "I also went there to get away from the new users a few months back"
exactly, XAX, because I knew people would try to /whois me
naughty naughty
Rain you mean people already did and found that "other channel"
yeah, I know they probably already did while I was in there for 6 min
but, gauging the average maturity level of this chat when Wrek draws something a little saucy, I am going to have to say that the channel would be ruined if any of the new users found it
i scored a 7!!!
/me sighs
heh. we got told to come back in here when we were in another channel the other night
/me sings and dances
Why must you think of us this way, Rain?
I will have you know I am level headed and such.
XAX, hipster
because I see comments like "Omg, Wrek, really? What is wrong with you?"
/me sighs again
silly people D:
ooh actually, speaking of Wrek, wonder if hes seen sabatons new album yet
i have been interviewed in informatics 10 minutes ago and i scored a 7! yeah!
er, what?
the channel I hang out in sometimes is 18+ nsfw
"!interviewed" "informatics" and "scored" dont really belong together
heh, lemons
Chrysalis: ?
which means that we can talk about anything, and they arent very happy to have some 14 year old come in and call them freaks for liking a little more mature chat.
understandable
you get some crazy convos in NSFW chats
yeah, but not that often
btw.. igotta go now i'm at school and using the laboratory computer to chat :D
the chat isnt dedicated to NSFW
cya pablez
its just a possibility for it
Rain: I figured that but still :P
Chrysalis: cya in 3-4 hours :D
the option is nice, and generally with the option of nsfw older people stay there, which actually reduces that chance of nsfw
^
"mature"
i hesistate to use the word mature usually
Why can't people appreciate saucy art? D:
again, maturity level is higher in that channel, and by maturity level, I dont mean nsfw stuff, I mean maturity in a mental sense
growing old is mandatory, growing up is optional
^
they are (usually) more grown up in there
anyone kno if theres places where i can get my headphones repaired
now i'm curious what channel?
not going to say.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: RMA?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane usually you either do it yourself or get new ones
That depends on the headphones
Tavi its against the rules to advertise other channels
so while we can talk about it, we cant actually name it
i have urban ear headphones
I for one wouldn't just buy another one, but then mine are >$300
warrentee
wow, fail spelling
that, and I dont want another "bronystate invasion" as they called it last time.
mine ar 150$
when i move my head or the cable
the sound cuts in and out
and iheards its broken wiring
how old are they
buuuunch of people coming in and either asking for porn or calling us disgusting XD
yoy can't send them back to Urban Ear?
Can you at least PM it to me Rain? I probably won't join too often, anyway.
Life_Essence: but i need like a reciept and bla bla bla
just curious Life_Essence if i can send em to a fix shop
as an Aussie living in the country my options for anything are pretty limited
probably not the best person to ask XD
promise to not make me regret it, XAX?
you wont
regret it LIKE A FOX
ooooh, we've got this notion
that we'd quite like to sail the ocean
so we're building a big boat to leave here for good
we're not keen on sinking
so that's why we're sitting thinking
yay my mom is baking a cake! :D
inb4 lies
cause we built it too big and we've run out of wood
The cake is a-- damn you and your inbox's
DUND UN
AUTOCORRECT
XAX, inb4 you grow to like that channel more than this one and dont show up in this one for a few months
inb4's*
\
:D
Rain: shuddup :<
:)
:\
6_9
Rain: This room has been the place I join daily for about 3 months now. I probably couldn't just leave it behind.
Then again, if it's as great as you say I is... >_>
Morning Ghostie
04PEOPLE OF BRONYSTATE
s
04I GIVE YOU
04RASPBERRIES

BLASPHEMY
04YOU IS TART
04Hello Chrysalis
I'm sure I've been called a tart before
04If you've been called a tart, then I find that funny
04Since it's technically an insult
I know
04But who the hell calls people tarts these days
/me mixes it into his ground beef and makes raspbergers.
see we don't have tarts here
pop tart I mean
04Pop Tarts are okay
My outdoor education teacher calls me "Ginger-face brother of Jesus"
-_-
04Such an upstanding outdoor education teacher
my workmate calls me Mr. Rophone
first name Mike
cause I have an afro
Better than my old chemistry teachers nickname for me
I got stuck with being called napalm
I wouldn't mind that
