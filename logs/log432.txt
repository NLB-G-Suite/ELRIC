By the way, the GED is stupidly easy
I've always had a natural aversion to cheating. It's a pride thing.
If I have to cheat then I have failed. I blame it on my parents.
HUnh-- OI took a GED myself-- never even stepped into high school. Lived in the woords for three years instead. Then after the GED, hit college and got a BA in COmmunications, wityh a minor in journalism.

YYZ is best instrumental
Wow, the crew is made up of a bunch of bastards.

By this evening, I should have Rarity's chapter finished and start roughing out Pinkie Pie's
i cant wait for the rebellion expansion! :)
How much fuel does that ship use?
Must be expensive.
http://i.imgur.com/717MY.jpg
first capital ship is free

bummer
Duties?
:)
k never mind
Was it mine?
if you didn't recognise the title... probably not
Mine is 'To Befriend a Mailpony.'
oooh
A play on 'To Kill a Mailman.'
Is it the computer for the ship?
/me might might play fall from heaven. I want's to play the mercurians
Cox needs to fix their HUB On Demand.
I want ponies on demand on my wide screen TV
kk
I think
Most of On Demadn is free
that the graphics are utter crap compared to similar games and still use way to much rescources only makes me dislike it more
Do I hear a TV in the background?
lol
oh hey, i saw ghostin the shell
I'm now a bit torn.. After this, I ether want to write a fic focusing on Celestia and Luna or a romance focused on Rarity with the song 'Uptown Girl' as insperation.

It broke
Ether way I'm going to upset some fans.
/me cries.
oh
the ponies appearantly dont want
NOOOOOOO
ha!
/me sees bit of Galatic Civilizations in this
Unicorns used to control them before and in this story, their immortality won't be something they enjoy.
Blow up the sun
DO EETT
/me controls the sun.
Mee
it got away, those pirates must be pissed
How do you define it?
seems ok
visually
immortality, connections to the stars (we did thsatfor cebturies) and then there's the whole uniting traits of all mortals in themselves thing
wait it says ur playing halflife 2
haha
regenerating shields for the win?
uniting traits of all mortals?
BOOOM
it's a Blackbird!
haha
I am lost.
yes. there've been depictions of higher beeings being hybrids of sorts. don't ask me about examples, i'm not that good, but i remember having read aboutit. you might want to look at indian religion
Fact 1: Celestia and Luna have lived for longer than 1000 years. However, they were not part of the three nations during Equestira's founding.
Do you disagree?
alicorns are pretty much the ultimate being, unitiing the traits of all 3 pony races.
Excatly.
Dat planet development.
or episode 10
Not really
Not the home world
But moving on.
gasp
brb peeps
haha
he can do it!
Fact 2: Celestia and Luna move the Moon and the Sun (though the latter it's more of turning the planet to face the sun but in any case.) However, we know that Unicorns used to do the same thing without the power of the Sisters.
He just has to believe.
time to taunt the pirates for a third time!
:P
Do you Disagree?
Knowledge acquired?
Knowledge is power
build more overlords!
I'll take that as a no.
HAHA
Do you disagree?
00,10FUn‚Ñ¢
F U(n)
F.U.N
Trademark? does that mean i cant have fun anymore?
Then they weren't immortal.
you can have fun, just not FUn
00,10F.U.N.E.X
and the thing with the omnipotence is pretty much something the more odern religions cameup with
Yes.
We are.
Is it?
Its does remind me of starcraft
purple needs to go. they got access to the neighbouring system
I bet Twilight can make herself immortal.
Yes
Being a master of magic and all.
I think she could.
Wouldn't make it an Alucorn trait then, would it?
You read the same comic that I did, didn't you?
project starwars
fun with tractor beams
by force
Do we really know that?
All we know is that they lived for a very long time.
We can make the 'assumption'.
However, we have no facts.
/me wants to be immortal.
NO, you don't.
And I can prove it.
oh noes
Exactly.
...
/me manly tear
Got too into it.
/me seriously wants to be immortal.
No evidence to prove it. No evidence to disprove it.
All a matter of faith?
aww
Maybe it's faith that makes them Deities. Well, if it can't be proven or disproven. Then this is all pointless. I'll write it how I want to.
actually ancient mythology has been full of features that would define luna and celestia as gods. maybe of lower rank, maybe half gods even, but they do have deity status
I for one don't disagree with any alternative theories.
and that's my point of view, and i'll defend it with a pitchfork
opy, Trixie worked in illusion and show magic. She never showed and abilities to put her in Twilght's league.
Maybe a lover?
The only thing that suggests that Celestia and Luna are viewed as deities is when ponies say, "As Celestia is my witness!"
Lopy*
That actually reminds me of the way that European Kingdoms treated their royalty
'As the Queen as my Witness'.
they had it coming
I know. And it's pretty silly.
Mooien everypony :)
oh, intresting
Close enough.
But as you are immortal, you won't age.
nostalga*
Now.. imagion you start forgetting
You start forgetting the ones you loved.
Memories are already fragile.
Their faces covered by the fog of time. You start forgetting little things, then more and more until you an't even remember their name or face.
^
Freddie mercury had it right
being immortal gives you lots of times to accept the facts
Trufact.
it fucks the whole schedule
One bad thing about immortality is out living the planet.
Heh, I was afraid this would go over a few heads.
taking a break I assume
Not really. I speak from personal experience.
I see
Immortality AND invincibility would suck.
I put someoen I loved with every fiber of my being into the ground. And now I spend many a sleepless night trying to keep my memories of her intact.. and I'm lossing.
Get used to loss? Get used to it.
I don't want to.
Well, most people assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect...
Maybe time is not simply linear.
I'd never want to get used to forgetting about someone like that. Get used to going to funerals. Get used to making myself move on and relearn how to live without them around.
I lost track of all this. Where are we in the conversation?
Why do you think Celestia and Luna stay up in their towers away from everyone?
They are distancing themselves from everything.
Hmm.
time hasent been really proven to exsits
02FFFFFFFFFFFF
02I got to stage 5 of SA
02;-;
of course they keep to themselves
it'S the logical curse
*course
taken out the pirates yet?
grrr
...if time was proven then time travel might be a option
errk
Anyway, I'm starting to get depressed.
why?
And I'm not in a depressing part of my stories yet.
good rewards though?
usaly if u go back in time ....its already happend before you even go back
Cryin's not for me. 'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'.
Would'nt we have time travelers coming to now if time travel were possible?
because its alread happend
They say we do, but they are clever. they dress up like you and me.
Well, theoretically, time travel would include moving faster than the speed of light.
the rule implys that if you go back in time the pardox is it has already happend before you go back in time
i iz back now

Which race has the strongest ships?
Lets just consider everyone is evil.
But for legitimate reasons.
Think this, guys.
WAR
Nothing is good about it.
Except it frees nations and peoples.
Ursups dictators and stops mass murders of people.
It just happens and you HOPE in the end, SOMETHING good comes out of it.
Well, the real good guys are the ones constantly being slandered everywhere.
American Revolution, Civil War, World War 2
Or do you want individual cases from each of those?
Oh?
Why not?
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/nyregion/at-92-movie-bootlegger-is-soldiers-hero.html
You can't just explain the "need" for war.
Yes I can.
Well, capitulating to everything just means you have no say in anything.
Exactly.

bah
Ouch, shot in the liver.
Huh?
You mean like Livecast, Shoutcast or the like?
livecast, yea
Twitch.tv
Well people use it for a lot more than that.
I was just thinking that it'd be a great idea for for like CBS or USA or something to stream movies and tv shows and have chatrooms... well, basically like this!
:'(
/me starts having manly tears.
its exactly why they dont do it
because its a good idea
if they do that for free, then they won't have the monies
anyway HI :)
i remember this
BOOM
swimming that far..what is this Grand theft auto?
He is the superman!
actually swimming that far isn't that hard
if you've got training
lol
and to be fair, he seems to be in pretty good shape
yeah, IF youve got training
Playlists like these need intermissions built in.
Twitch.Tv and the like already have a business model for people ot make money off of streaming
And then explosions
I haven't trained for a couple years, but I'm pretty sure with 6 months training I could do it
he good at thieving
and triathlon for fun once
you are a crazy motherfucker
inoright
everypony I know believes I'm a weak nerd
hmm
but the techniques stay
I still swim decently fast easily
used to swim 2h15m a week
+ the occasional competition
..thats the good news...do they have great news?
lol
Dat food.
If that is really food.
suriviving in jail like a boss...
ewwww

Hospital food is the worst
but then again, the only army food I've ever tasted was from the french army >.>
Not even sure if thats actually food
It's illegal to swim in a business suit.
yeah, hospital food is horrible
I like hospital food...
but Ill eat anything...
the one time I had to stay at the hospital, I chose to let myself colapse from hypoglycemia rather than eat the bs they gave me
hmm
