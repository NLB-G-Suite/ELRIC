SunderlandPony89: my hell actually began in high school. in my retarded high school we had more homework than physically possible to do
WHAT IS THIS THING?=??
Woah.....
/me hugs Kandarihu|Mourning

This is the only one I knew ever since she was a kitten. All the others we adopted when they were already adults.
Like you guys didn't already?:D
RD metalocalypse
Cat in my house died 2 weeks ago, not mine but my brothers, that was sad to be around
twilight_sprinkle: I always got around that by not doing my homework.
twilight_sprinkle: I get a pretty OK amount of homework. I very rarely get swamped with homework
Dken2021: Hmmmm, that sounds like a great idea!
dat horrid grammer :P
COOL
:(
OH GOD NO
sorry to hear that Kandarihu|Mourning :(
11,01Gunthler|Narrator: Wut?
TheRainbowDash hmm?
SunderlandPony89: grammar
Reikim: yeah. in my country cheating wasnt a big deal, so everybody cheated
WHY IS THERE A g3 MY LITTLE PONY PERSONA FOR FIREFOX?!
Dken2021: About Dash metalocalpase.
Thank you everyone.
twilight_sprinkle: What? You cheated? I just didn't do my homework. Never had to cheat :)
lolz, nathan has the normal dad experience
hahaha Murderface
Ahhh, got 21st Century Schizoid man on my phone :)
Nittany_Discord: Oh.. Dat Dashie vid :D
oh yes.....
Reikim: EVERYONE cheated, not a single person didnt, it was just impossible to do the stuff in time otherwise, the school was stupid-hard+ we were in honors class
:D These guys aren't the brightest :).
Poor Toki
twilight_sprinkle: I can't even imagine a school that hard.
so..... anypony here from texas
I never cheated, then again, I didn't pass high school
complete avoidenss of family
Reikim: yeah it was retarded
I will always remember her for her tenacity, her love of heights, and her love of sniffing plastic.
Hahaha:D
mitamaking: you failed high school?
Dropped out
Yaaah, somevon clearly knows da Norvigen aksent.
and failed
ouch
twilight_sprinkle: I'll admit, even though I dont like cheating I probably would if I got as much homework as you did
JUST GO INSIDE!
I didn't do homework
wow, his dad is s dick
i still got homework...
....
well i can always do it tomarwow
how fun
SunderlandPony89: if you grew up in my country you would do it simply because its not a big deal there. sure, on final exams it is, but other than that it isnt.
AJTheMightyGamer: That is why I had to get a GED
twilight_sprinkle: Where do you live then? I'm kinda curious
By the way, the GED is stupidly easy
ah,
I've always had a natural aversion to cheating. It's a pride thing.
mitamaking how easy is it?
Reikim: Same here
If I have to cheat then I have failed. I blame it on my parents.
SunderlandPony89: plus in my school before that i didnt cheat, others cheated off me. but in that school everyone cheated
Chrysalis persona for firefox ftw
I didn't pass High school and got all but like 3 questions right
HUnh-- OI took a GED myself-- never even stepped into high school. Lived in the woords for three years instead. Then after the GED, hit college and got a BA in COmmunications, wityh a minor in journalism.
Same here Dken2021
I have a question
Nothing wrong with that Dken2021.
Yes, my life at times has been strange.
Are there pony desktop icons?
Reikim: im in college now and i dont cheat, i dont need to
i am almost done with my freashman year, things are getting rough
Kencolt was apparently Robin Hood as a teen
Pride and goody goody :P
Where?
High school was harder than college too
Reikim: my high school was just crazy hard
whoops
want me to find it
^^
RAWRity: this
Digit|Skyrim: sure
Well, I did study arhery and fencing in college.
twilight_sprinkle: You'd think that a school that hard would crack down more on cheating.
hold on
Archery.
:o at Metelocolypse
DICK LEVEL: OVER 9000
:D
YAY!
Kencolt: at some point or another, you'll have to explain the whole "living in the woods" thing.
??? is this
Reikim: the nice teachers didnt punish us too hard if they caughts us, but our class was pro at cheating, youd be amazed at the schemes we had
what is this i dont even?
RAWRity: Actually, the details are rather private-- I'd rather not explain.
banana
twilight_sprinkle: I'm probably going to regret this, but...what schemes?
LOL
Ponyville, the town that is friendly to everyone, unless your a zebra,griffin, or anything non pony
Reikim: I'm actaully interested too
Come fellow Bro State folks, let us dance to the song of our people.
Reikim: "oops i dropped a piece of paper" "can i go to bathroom" telephones, calculator passing(with notes inside), cheat sheets hidden
Ponyville is full of racists
A zebra comes to town, afraid of her for no reason
lolwut
for now I'm just going to assume Kencolt is this guy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colton_Harris-Moore
POnyville is full of ponies, and ponies are easily frightened.
Anyway we all know Fluttershy is black
true
Reikim: originally i didnt cheat much, but then somethhing happened to my health, and i couldnt work 24/7 any more
The town is full of idiots
11,01Lightning outside.
She's yellow
about the scared easily thing
^
Reikim: i still always did my best in hw tho
RAWRity: Nope. Not even close.
but hey, whatever your headcanon perfers
Reikim: its not like i didnt work hard, it was just physically impossible to do everything
Kandarihu|Mourning: Explain her Flutterguy voice
lol dis vid :D
oh lord
twilight_sprinkle: ah, I see. That's interesting, though. You don't often hear about other schools' schooling methods.
dat trixie!
I mean for no reason ponyville was a total dick to fluttershy
That was the effect of the poison joke. Would it be nearly as funny if she had the voice of a male tenor?
THis isn't the best treatment of this song. The best I ever saw was an AMV from El Hazzard.
Reikim: my country was corrupt to the core, it was ordinary
Reikim: *is corrupt to the core
Kandarihu|Mourning: I think Vanilla Ice would have been funnier
Not to mention Luna finaly comes back and they think she's nightmare moon...what the hell
twilight_sprinkle: On this side of the Atlantic, our education rates are always falling. Half the students are lazy, stupid or both. Including me, but I made up for being lazy by having a knack for making the teachers not hate me.
twilight_sprinkle: You consider your school corrupt?
Snakes n' Barrels. . . Too obvious.
02wow HML never knows what he's talking about
/me hides
oh my...
1,3sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)

Man, Flutterguy is exploitable
hi Petrified_Discord
Reikim: heh, i never tried making teachers like me. they generally liked me, but my physics teacher hated me
TheRainbowDash: *waves and hugs back* Just dandy. Urself?
Sober musicians? no thanks. Some of my favorite songs are ever are about drinking.
Haha!
Reikim: and she kept giving me crappy grades for it
hello everyone
hai Bluestrom_S
I love it "sober rock and roll", that's like a PB&J sandwich without the bread.
hey Bluestrom_S

Petrified_Discord: Awesome! Finished the first chapter of my fanfic, and got ost of my stuff done already.:)
ello Bluestrom_S
Hello Bluestrom_S! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
Hai Bluestrom_S
TheRainbowDash: Fanfic, you say? *interested*
SunderlandPony89: again, its not a big deal in my country
Petrified_Discord: Yeah, I can send you the link in PM, if you're interested to read it.
hi TheRainbowDash good how about you
twilight_sprinkle: Here, it's as easy as being that one student that isn't an idiot and doesn't look for trouble. Also, actually paying attention. Being half-Chinese helped get me good grades, too :)
TheRainbowDash: Totally, goatee
Bluestrom_S: Awesome! Finished part of my first fanfic.
thats good
Planet piss
SunderlandPony89: the most corrupt thing in education was with the inttroduction of the country-wide final exam. all the teachers worried that the students would get worse grades than in school which would make it look like the teachers were giving too high grade
gotta a link?
Reikim: I generally do find history and literature in school interesting myself
SunderlandPony89: so what they did was give WORSE grades so they can always say "yeah he didnt study, but he prepared well for finals"
break ALL THE LAMPS
Reikim: dem asians
twilight_sprinkle: That's so...I don't even.
yeah, to hell with the lamps
Reikim: yep

completelife: Oh, you noticed.
Later TheRainbowDash.
bye TheRainbowDash
Cayan oh, yea, but bare;y watched it then
welcome to the heard
...I'm new here and I knew that loool
completelife: New to the herd or new to Bronystate?

c ya
03but I have a tracking number which may or may not be updated more than once
bye bye rainbow dashe
11,01Thunderkins.
Cya TheRainbowDash
dat japanese
completelife: well each streamer can be identified by the pony in the corner for instance caramel is ValtheJean's fav or somthing so you see it alot...
dafuq
dat super robot wars
SO APPROPRIATE :Dhttp://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3feginsUh1roepq0o1_1280.jpg
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3feginsUh1roepq0o1_1280.jpg
imma try to brush FS's hair
2,14 Dken: try Gurren Lagann
tracking info gets updated somewhat sporadically
I'm going to start downloading Kawata Shoujou, can't load Bronystate anymore so bye bye
good luck mario
Bye TheRainbowDash!
and make it look like the shows
Petrified_Discord: LOL
Oh and everyone should try TTGL
interesting Shamoc
I did it a couple weeks ago and I managed to mess it up a little DX
Cya and have fun mitamaking
ValtheJean: is it ur favorite anime?
2,14 nope
oh, just saying super robot wars since I hear this song from it
I'm not even going to try with Pinkie Pie because I'll be really upset if I mess that up too.
ValtheJean: whats ur fav anime?
Hmm... Spiral Power-- and a spiral horn... hmmmmm.
completelife..also for chat if you wanna do the ping thing hit tab on a partially complete name of someone in chat or just spell it correctly...
Fun fact: The giant Kamina thing is 52 BILLION LIGHT YEARS TALL
so... much.... awesome
CupcakeWarrior: fun fact....you said that last time
I LOVED TTGL
03well
so....why are ponies worshipped anyways
I did?
Shamwow:
I didn't know light years was a measurement of distance
03USPS makes it very evident that "delivery confirmation" is exactly that rather than "tracking"
completelife: because they are gods
Shamroc: Sorry I dont remember that
Fun fact, this fact isn't really fun
is completelife new or something?
no wait, messed that up
03for Priority Mail sometimes they update it more often since it's "priority" but LOL
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyg1clC0ge1ro9en2o1_1280.jpg
completelife: I didn't know they were
.... Dken2021 it is the amount of space light can travel in a year
oh complete loool everypony has their own reason for liking ponies
Shamroc yea, just realized that when I typed it
ValtheJean: whats ur favorite anime? :3
Dken2021....lol
saffron souffle i dont really get that
hot-blooded pinkie ftw
imjustaderper: Yup
I get goosebumps everytime I watch this
MahBoi777: ikr?
What's amazing is somepony had to THINK of this!
xD
Kencolt: And the best part is it ends in FUCKING FISTFIGHT! :D
Kencolt: eh, everything is being ponified
And then the universe collapsed 0_0
2,14 Twilight_sprinkle: that's kind of hard to say
SunderlandPony89: I thought so.
2wb
Man the Japanese can be just awesome
lol yep
so..whats the difference between a "brony" and a "pony"
wat
completelife...brony=human pony=small version of horse
lol
TTGL is so badass that the final battle causes a big bang
completelife: What's there to not understand? I bet everypony in here bronies or pegasisters it up in here for a different reason that's their own.
......
LOL
dem glasses
2./late
so confused
What the buck did I come back to the chat to find...?
that souinded like link
I love how this video is what got me to watch Gurren Lagaan in the first place
...awesome thats what Unicorn_Gundam
Unicorn_Gundam: One of the best things to stream
what the buck am i watching?
ooooh
Exactly what I want to know..
network ban i see
I watched GL because I heard it was awesome
One thing I dislike about the Gurren Lagann dub: the guy they got to do Kamina was not nearly intense enough.
Digit|Skyrim: who?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m13hg5L35e1ro9en2o1_500.jpg
dem colofull explosions
I thought links weren't allowed during the stream..
Woah.
Digit|Skyrim: a ban u say?

Unicorn_Gundam: image links are fine

Guralagan
This show is f*yay*king badass
SaxyPretender What seems to be the problem?
2,14 Kencolt: and that's exactly what we're watching
MahBoi777: can i see a picture of you :3
RAWRity: Whats wrong with that episode?
Episode 4?
and surprinsingly I'm not muting cause that opening music is awesome
and its a good one too
0,14bombed midterm = bleh
Just pointing it out, ValtheJean .
They didn't do a bad job with the dub, but during the screaming scenes the jap dub is noticibly better :)
i hate the hate the intro -.-
Is this 3 or 4?
Please be the dub
CupcakeWarrior: the fucking animation. It's so horrendous I thought my computer was fucking up.
2,14 so I stuck with the dub
SaxyPretender: its only a midterm, you can still fix it
I gotta say I love the way the english Kamina says "Fly piggies!"
When in the Japanese version it's like someone is dying
...oh wait not first?
ValtheJean: the dub for GL is pretty good, though Kamina needs wome work.
RAWRity: Thats the 5th episode
2,14 yeah, it's not bad
I thought
mario_pony: one sec
SaxyPretender Ah, I feel ya. I did that as well this semester. First time.
hey.. what show is this again?
Gurren Laggan
WHY IS SHE IN A THONG?!
ah, thx
...or something that's basically one
I do too Val. I usually don't watch dubs at all unless it's an anime I watched as a kid
because fanservice
Gurren Lagaan. It's about hot blood, insane action, and truly absurd fanservice.
dat..... never mind lol
MANLY SPIRIT SOLVES EVERYTHING
Kencolt sounds like my kind of anme
sounds like high school of the dead
In other words, as far as she's concerned, this is normal everyday attaire.

RAWRity: HE did BWG?

No ghost stories was accurate...

EPIC!
Ewww...this doesn't sound like Gurren Lagann...
Yoko is my new favourite anime girl....
up his butt and out his nose? damn that sounds nasty
best description of TTGL I've seen: "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is what you ge when you ask Studio Gainax to produce a saturday morning cartoon."
dat ending
i thought he was gonna say "why don't we save that nasty stuff for the bedroom?"
you fuzz balls
oh hqi der MahBoi777 :)

0,14one of the songs has a hidden message that confirms it
stalkaminer super robot wars
best kill eva
/me explodes
if he wasn't gay that would just make him even weirder
REAL MEN LOOK AWAY FROM EXPLOSIONS!
Oh, come on. No-one who acts THAT sterotypically gay can actually BE gay!
SaxyPretender: not like it was apparent from the start or anything...
Kencolt: he's gay
Sunglasses make awesome weapons. Remember that Resident Evil movie? The ONLY good part was when Wesker threw his glasses at whats-his-face :D
DaaAAAAaaA
DRILLS FROM EVREYWHERE!
/me sweeps up Midnight_Tempest's bits into a neat pile

So many explosions

0,14later AJTheMightyGamer
otakon...but overkill is fun
nighty AJTheMightyGamer
so many drills im thinking wrong
i told you that everything was explosions
Shamroc: like I said, NO KILL LIKE OVERKILL
You have yet to see overkill.
moar yoko plss?
0,14also, Ep 4
DaringDude: calm yourself
otakon..........what? im confused
0,14aka the one that everyone hates
lol
Giga Drill Break, y u no Giga Drill Breaker?
Shamroc: the saying goes "There is no kill like overkill"
is it some kind of BLAM episode?
0,14nope
otakon..is that a good thing?
Shamroc: i.e. OVERKILL is good
0,14but the animation is
AWW YEAAA
I don't hate this one-- I just find it insanely depressing.
SaxyPretender: isn't it that sketchy stretched style I see from time to time?
i just dont like the intro
:D
stalkaminer: I love the intro
... Kencolt that means it's good writing..or somthing
I love this intro song
Kencolt: agreed
ikr
0,14iirc, the guy who did the animation for this ep also did some segments for FLCL
stalkaminer: I can see that. If it weren't for the visuals, it would be kinda out of place
Dken2021: the extended version during the final fight is awesome
0,14as for those loving the opening and don't know the title
FCLC ftw :)
0,14it's Sorairo Days
dammit
u have point
SaxyPretender: I'm pretty sure he also did some stuff for Samurai 7
dat fail spelling
It means, Shamroc , that it introduces a character that is honest, idealistic, and at the same time, one of the great jerks of history.
Kencolt: yep
that elongated, sketchy stretched artstyle that is very loose.
VERY loose
/me nyans someone
I wonder if BANDAI likes bonsai trees...
As I recall, FLCL was what Gainax decided to do in order to cheer up their animators after they had to work on the very depressing, very stressful final 1/3 of EVA
0,14^^^
RAWRity: pretty sure
have all the faces?
FLCL was the awesomest anime to ever awesome...ever
animating this show does looks hell difficult
0,14also, I regret not getting into Gurren Lagann earlier
Why do the dubs always have less...oomf than the original? Not just English dubs. Is there something with dubbing an already-made show I wonder... 6_9
Here's something random again
Yeah I liked FLCL a lot *u*
Petrified_Discord: I don't know
0,14I could've had a Revolvtech Gurren Lagann
also it's because it's something redubbed and usually localized
MANLY!
argh that artstyle!
oh my, I can see the animation drop
0,14yep
woahhhh
Ah the animation, THE ANIMATION!
so sketchy so.............ARGH!@?!
he looks diffrent
This is when I realized there were multiple studios animating TTGL :D
Even if they don't localize it, dubbing over it makes it lose some of the original meaning that the animators intended.
Ya'll know that tab at the top of the side of mac 'n' cheese that seems impossible to open?
I didn't notice it the first time i saw this
xD
02I should change my nick to LOL and get mad at people every time they nick alert me
Petrified_Discord: depends on the dub really. there are some dubs that work even better than the original japanese. For instance, Death Note's dub is, imo superior.
Digit|Skyrim: me neither
bububuuu
/me hides
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME! :[
lol
and then he killed him
the end.
twilight_sprinkle: enope

good afternoon everypony did you all miss me?
ada boy da boy ada boy lol
howdy DeathStar
lol
/me glomps DeathStar
hai DeathStar
I prefer dubs because you dont have to read the screen, and therefore, you can actually focus on the show
Petrified_Discord: but as far as your question, there's lots of stuff. Some shows are just difficult to translate, or they have themes that english speakers aren't familiar enough with, or the director doesn't totally understand the material, or the voice actors aren't as experienced.
/me sits on Aurora
SaxyPretender: she did a GREAT job as Haruko, nearly spot on as the original
pop
/me hugs MahBoi777
puff
my point being, you don't need to change your name to something stupid for that kind of reaction
Dubbing a show is HARD, is what I'm saying.
yes what RAWRity said
oh hai DeathStar :)
RAWRity: Yeah...you kinda need the perfect storm to get a good dub
CupcakeWarrior: not always
/me hugs DeathStar :3
oh hai DeathStar
Gattai!
0,14yep, but dubs over the years have gotten better
hugs DaringDude
WHY ARE THERE SO FEW FRAMES OF ANIMATION!?
And that's if the dubbing compant doesn't decide that it's for children
jeez kamina looks so weird
otakon: If I have to READ it, then I cant focus on the show
DeathStar: chat just wasn't the same, lol
dat infinate rock supply
RAWRity: The Japanese seem to have similar problems with US toons-- which is why they rarely import any animation.
Holy shit
Same here SaxyPretender :D
gohohohoho
*are hard
SaxyPretender: indeed!
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
CupcakeWarrior: you lack discipline if you can't read and focus at the same time
MahBoi777: I'm sure it wassn't :)
0,14they already announced the cast
I nearly died when i found out they were doing a dub
and I didn't miss much :D
CupcakeWarrior: I do it all the time
RAWRity: Ever seen Baccano or Kenichi? Those are some pretty good dubs :)
bomb!
tbh I'm not really looking forward to the P&G dub
CupcakeWarrior: it'll never happen
02true XD

changing nicks to common words is really annoying, and it tended to break stats
I don't want to see what they're going to change. Just like how I'm really really not looking forward to the dub of Deadman Wonderland

You can't fool me, Dken2021. That's from Doctor Who.
02well, once I changed my name to someone but that was a joke
but back in the day? oh LORD are there shome shitty dubs from the 90's. Especially the original "Akira" dub. Oh GOD that dub.
rofl
0,14also, Kittan has BROOKLYN RAGE
Is this the episode with the bad animation?
/me dances
Kencolt: not really, they're pretty good Ganman fighters
the animation in this episode is....not great
oh shit more girls hitting on im
Monfang what you're thinking is TARDIS
otakon: its not a problem, i can check the stream at any point during the show and itll be fanservice :P
Oh.. they sound the same
ah yes, the "oh crap the budget ran out" episode.
I meant OUTSIDE of a Gunman!
I STOOOOOOWLE EEEET
@ RAWRity: I just left an animu board that had most people raving about how ~amazing~ dubs are even for crap like Soul Eater
SHOUT COMPATITION!
I honestly cant tell the difference between this ep's animation and the last one's
twilight_sprinkle: NO IT WON'T ITS NOT NOW THERE WAS NONE IN THE LAST EPISODE WATCH THE DAMN SHOW! AND GIVE IT A CHANCE!
/me dances on Petrified_Discord s head
There are only three stars in the sky?
CupcakeWarrior: it changes between kamina and simon
Ohai DeathStar

The animation is still good on this episode imo
I have NO idea what tha was for

twilight_sprinkle: argh
I'm Kiyal...I'm Rainbow Dash

DaringDude: Go watch Ikki Tousen :D

I'll take glasses girl
03yeah
the page looks loaded, but it doesn't bring anything up
03hm
so many boobs
03apparently they changed it to .nl
03LOL
...long eyelashes? What...?
youtube awaayyy!!!
RAWRity: ALL THE BOOBS
03wait
otakon: i am, whats stopping f=me from constating a fact
DaringDude: no, you want fanservice watch Eiken. You'll swear off Fanservice forever after that.
03they just blocked USA from accessing it
03great
That is what Gainax is known for, and that's what they stick to. Just look ad Medaka Box
0,14I like the Manly yelling the best
lol lyra
otakon: dat typo by me
yummy? bitch you serious?
Ive seen so many dubs I recognize all these voices
if you want fanservice watch Queen's Blade. Just sayin'
:D
is that a pink beastman
02I wouldn't want to be the owner of that site LOL
/me dances
otakon: Eiken isn't even fanservice. it's fucking AWFUL
Saffron_Souffle: The first episode has a character that shoots acid out of her tits
Saffron_Souffle: at least that has story and some character development
so hungry..lol
RAWRity: it is, but the bewbs :3
/me likes Kirika to his shame.
Yeah I know Cucake LOL She's actually my favorite character out of the whole series.
I can see where they saved some animation
Queen's Blade is a crappy show, but it DOES get the fanservice stuff right. In that I can actually imagine somebody getting arroused by it. Eiken is just horrifying.
I watched Eiken once, it terrified me
Saffron_Souffle: Cattleya is mine.
OH GOD
what...
0,14dat voice
Saffron_Souffle: Shes my favorite too
Melona's acid tits made me lol until I cried the first time I saw it
DUFUQ IS THAT
0,14it's Derek Stephen Price
Oh crap, it is
who is that?
ugh.... Queen's Blade
that and I thought she was really really cute
hair balls?
the HELL?
funfact, this episode was directed by the guy who made "Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad" and "Paradise Kiss"
lol
:D
what am i watching right now
dafaq just happened?
/me dances
02people from the US not being able to use it might keep it safe though
Moogles AWAAAAAAAY
I KNEW IT!!
lalalalalala
ALAALLALALALLALALLA

Sylandest: Beastmen were taking a nap and they mistaked them for food
LALALA

lalaalalalaaalalallaa
ALALALALA
i don't evekn know what i'm watching anymore
lalalalalalalllalalalalla!!!
otakon ya thats a lil to much fanservice
llollolololololol
Space just got 20% Cooler?
SaxyPretender: indeed

tf are they riding, moogles?
LALALALALALALALALALALAAAA~~
bum, bum bum bum bum
one of them yells "Yolo!" and they all die.
yes dogmoogles
otakon: I figured that, but my sleepy brain had trouble comprehending
03and it works fine there
DaringDude: you looked it up didn't you?
03it redirects to multiupload.nl which also doesn't work here
maybe...
/me dances
03though FML all the links are dead
03ps3free-ps3keys-master.tar.gz <- I need that file
lol
DaringDude: Komoe should make you a little uncomfortable
You know what show is worse than Eiken though? Ikki Tousen
lol
derp
lol
dumbass
0,14>.>
0,14<.<
In Ikki Tousen, the girls' clothes seem to be made out of toilet paper or something
RAWRity: argh, it's not even fun to watch
02remember what happened to magaupload Aurora?
Tenchi Tengo is bad as well
O_o
/me coughs akwardly
dat mustache
They dissolve at the slightest touch
Ikki Tousen was fun to read though.
/me goes back to his corner and plays with his knives
tbh the last modern animu i watched was Deadman Wonderland so I don't know of these fanservice-y animus with their slice of life boring also fuq k-on i am above the moe
/me notices SaxyPretender cough awkwardly
lol
02that's why they should block the US
though I only say Ikki Tousen because it's longer and ongoing. for pure, vile, despicable anime, the go to show is "Master of Martial Hearts"
Girls Bravo has way too much nudity
Saffron_Souffle: please don't say animu you sound like a idiot
...lol
Midnight_Tempest: awesome knives
03not really.
ha animu
then again, I like almost anything based on Romance of the Three Kingdoms, so...
03if they aren't located in the US then it's not a big deal
/me 11,01combines
High Scool of the dead had unnessisary fanservice
Nittany_Discord: with what?
*school
lick
....what tounge larger than body..
Zombie fanservice?
02megaupload was in China LOL
Dken2021: yet it also had great action scenes
ewww
/me dances on Midnight_Tempest s knives
I love how Kamina gets the concept of spiral energy before ANYONE ELSE!
um.
Dken2021: ive heard its a good show for all its fanservice
03no
MahBoi777: you dont know bro... ive only shown one pic of my knives... hmmm, i should take a pic of them all
Dken2021: Zombie fanservice?
Because Master of Martial Hearts is shitty, cheap fanservice for 4 eps, and then AWFUL DISGUSTING HORRFYING PLOT TWIST FROM NOWHERE for the last episode.
02oh
DeathStar: u so silly ^_^
I liked high school of the dead, and suprisingly the fan service did not bother me
sure, xombie fanservice
CupcakeWarrior: no, the living girls got big boewbs
*zombie
Midnight_Tempest: :)
11,01I hate ecchi animes (with assloads of fanservice).
^
also, tildes~!
then we have the uK blocking sites that aren't located in their legality circle
*UK
02well that was stupid of megaupload
~~~~~~~~~~`````
0,14...that unintentional pun
"assloads" fitting
13>ecchi animes
fanservice?
13>assloads
13what you did there
I don't mind fanserivce but the anime that has a million pantyshots and boobs everywhere getreally annoying really fast.
13we see it
dat dog thig
bwhahaha
11,01There are some really nice stories, but the constant fanservice ruins them.
why was it stupid?
^
11,01Lol Shizuka. Didn't mean it.
Nittany_Discord: I liked Green Green
02having anything in the US
Midnight_Tempest: oh yea, I remember that pic lol
why
DED
Nittany_Discord: too late, no take backs
03right, but that's all the government can do is block stuff, they can't take the site down unless the servers are there
hey otakon
03and there are ways around it
DOOOOOOODGE!
that and a certain show put me off anime for awhile
yes twilight_sprinkle?
dude, go back in time a bit...before the megaupload thing, people didn't even forsee all of this blocking drama.
03there are ways to access TPB from the UK, people are just paranoid and lazy
MahBoi777: yeah, and that is only 1 of about 12 or 13 knives ive got... need more pics
otakon: nothin?
Nittany_Discord: Please tell me you didnt watch the dub
02that's how the government was able to crack down on them
MANLY COMBINING!
11,01Almost got into this zombie one.
twilight_sprinkle: nothing what?
There was this one thing that someone convinced me to read that was about these people who stole boobies and made women flat chested or some crap and I didn't get past the second chapter.
/me combines manlily
Dken2021: what show put you off anime for awhile?
otakon: nothing is nothing, it is the absence of anything
I can't even remember what it's called either.
Nittany_Discord: Even I think the dub is terrible
Nittany_Discord: i read the first couple chapters of the manga...i liked it
twilight_sprinkle: the HELL are you talking about?
dat bed
also I WANT THAT BED
also, for anybody who's a fan of rock, definitely look up the anime "Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad"
Sylandest rather not say, I think there are either fans her or people that hate it so much
it's fantastic.

However do take care that if your SACD is multi-channel (not all are), you choose one of the mch formats, not 2ch.
03So not that?

otakon listens to the wind
Kencolt: Unless they have parents that make them learn history
it's a heart
I don't listen to any music nowadays.
Hmm...how can i leave a note for someone?
0,14I liked Caravan from Rush
No one?
Nope.

CupcakeWarrior: oh, tha's nothing. recently i saw a facebook-convo where some girl thought the third reich was just a fairy tale to scare little kids

SaxyPretender I like Fly By Night :)
03hm
03yeah these 5.1s are kinda useless
but for some reason, the actual messages were english
0,14that was the other single right?
Dark_Horst: Dear GOD. THose who do not know the past...
I like Red Barchetta.
Ehhh. I watched the History channel and the Discovery Channel often. Its alot better than the other channels I get.
YYZ is best instrumental
Are doomed to repeat it, Kencolt?
oh yeah, blame the new kid
Kencolt: Are doomed to repeat it
probably didnt spell that right, dont care.
0,14I once asked a Rush fan for some recommendations
Wow, the crew is made up of a bunch of bastards.
Twi_Fi: eeyup
I like a lot of Rush's songs *Notice how I didn't say alot*
As though I needed to complete it...
Kencolt: you just wanna smack them with the biggest history book you can find
This is kinda why I didn't like this anime.
ok
0,14and i was introduced the Different Stages version of Dreamline
SaxyPretender: 2112 was awesome
Too many bastards...
0,14I need to listen to 2112
Ninjazz, yeah, I can see that now.
Rush is awesome
0,14and a LOT of Rush's repetoire
yeah, they never lift on something THEY ARE GREAT AT DOING.......
0,14I love what I've heard, but I'll admit I haven't heard a lot ;__;
The probably when I listen to music is that I rarely remember the names of songs or artists.
SaxyPretender: have you ever listened to Coheed and Cambria?
Then we see SOME kindness... They spit in his face again.
I meant to say for money dammit
0,14I've listen to a couple of tunes
Ninjazz: it gets worse
SaxyPretender I watched the documentary for rush GASP Movie night idea!
"We have stupid ideals and we're mad at you for not knowing about and accepting them." Seems legit :|
money money money
http://sa-cd.net/search/dire+straits < the reviews about the multich version are kinda rubbish if you say the multich is an upscale
0,14the one that stands out the most is Welcome Home >.>
otakon: For pete's sake...
but the stereo version might be an imporvment?
Ninjazz: well it gets better afterwards though
0,14aka the one C&C song that EVERYONE knows
the hell is this guy?
It has to. This anime would be unbearable if it didn't.
SaxyPretender: Roll the bones is pretty different.
MahBoi777: The root of all awesome=money,cough i mean ponies
03http://sa-cd.net/showtitle/3030 <- it's this
I can't wait until the boy snaps and seeks revenge.
yes
Ninjazz: what? I cast of insufferable bastards? Have you ever seen Black Lagoon?
otakon: Some...
0,14I think I've heard good things about Roll the Bones
SaxyPretender: c&c? as is command&conquer?

I'm gonna give you guys a teaser. I'm rather proud of this paragraph:
"	She shakes her head rapidly to get the negative thoughts out of her mind, her blond mess of hair bluring around her in a yellow haze. “Focus Ditzy. If you want good memories, you gotta make them. Like good muffins they require hard work and focus. Especially blue berry muffins. And banana nut muffins. Chocolate chip muffins.” She licked her lips as her mind wondered to food, her wings
heading home to see if she had any made before snapping out of her muffin daze with a hoof across the cheek. “Focus Ditzy! Mail first, muffins later.”"

/me watches everypony @_@
I would happily listen to any music. Except for modern pop/rap.
Twi_Fi: Can't wait till they say that
Oh hey Troll didn't I see you a few minutes ago?
I like most music as long as it isnt rap or country
Troll: Ypol
I grew up on metal.
/me likes all music :)
there was a time... long ago... that i could sing like that, with that growl
Polydunami: Hai, yah i come and go ha
And what ever Doom played at the time.
One of my favorite genres is Noise
I can not tolerate modern rap or pop. I simply can't. It's not in me.
I dont even know why
MahBoi777: yoyoyo
I mean, you seem similar to a future form of Ninjazz. What's up with that?
A dubstep remix of country metal rap music, would you listen to it?
no
Polydunami: Hmmmm?
Troll: Hey!:D
:P
I am no way associated with the future or past form of myself.
i has 3 fav genres
I like ponies
it wud be awesome to meet ur future self
You know what's awesome? Monster - Aviators/Omnipony
Ninjazz: That could be said with everypony too
If you like dubstep that is :p
Ninjazz: That's right. Somepony was posing as your future self just five minutes ago
/me puts an awesome face on Troll
alternitive and dubstep
Thats funny
Polydunami: Lies!
I can't believe I'm so popular that people want to cosplay as my future self *sarcasm*

CupcakeWarrior: I'm okay wiht the parts that don't involve Misha speaking.
/me sighs
though at least her hairdo isn't so god damn ridiculous anymore.
Is RAWRity playing The Feelz again?
Ninjazz: yes. this time the Feel of the day is anger.
anger at THE FUCKING TILDES.
/me glomps Digitalis from out of nowhere.
Daayuum!

PONIES. PONIES EVERYWHERE
/me hits Ninjazz
Pinkies4thWall, welcome.
Ow.
/me hits Ninjazz
what's sad is, there's a song I really like that's called "~" and I can't listen to it anymore because of that.
/me huggles Midnight_Tempest
ow.
Hello Pinkies4thWall :)
Digitalis: ^__^
:D
HELLO Pinkies4thWall.
Have something against ~?
hi Ninjazz, Polydunami, HELLO Twi_Fi
~~~~~~~~~~~
Where did {-_-} get to?
RAWRity: Wahahaha~
yfw it was Pinkies4thWall the whole time
{-_-}
So I was poking around doing research when I stubled on Reddit and noticed that people were arguing against Fleur de Lis' name because it has three parts, breaking the pattern of Pony Names. And I couldn't help but think.. "What about Pinkimania Diane Pie?"
I don't even get why people do this~
Ask Nyria
Monfang|Writing: People are stupid, bro.
seriously, if anybody here is a fan of hardcore punk, look up the song "~" by Touche Amore. it's awesome.
^
BAH
/me has been logged in for over 12 hours. Fun fact.
:D
its okay Digitalis
/me hugs Digitalis
/me huggles Ninjazz ^^
Ninjazz: i have...only ..a few...Seconds...Princess Celestria gave me a message.. to tell you....NuuuuU
"And if actions speak louder than words. I'll be the most deafening noice you've ever heard."
/me bonks Future...
Damn...
Get on with it, Future-Ninjazz!
Wait
O_O dat TARDIS
gone
It's sorta like people thinking that Rarity's accent is real. If you actually watched the show, you'd know that it isn't.
Nyria started a random PM conversation with me just for the sake of talking. Such a polite person :o
Heh. I'll look it up, RAWRity.
i say when its a future
Future-Ninjazz disappeared right then and there
/me sets up a Time Lock on the chat
Okay everypony.
Where was Gondor when Future-Ninjazz could say whatever he needed to say?
Let's stop time.
Monfang|Writing: i'm still trying to figure out what accent it's supposed to be in the first place
couldn't*
And now that was {-_-} as Future-Ninjazz this time
Her real one or fake one?
both
Chinese
My birthday is in less than four minutes
who here has worked with pony rigs in flash before?
(´･ω･`)
How old, Polydunami? ^_^
Polydunami: HAPPY BIRTHDAY
As she grew older, she took on a fake one that would belong to something more of a Southern Bell.
aha
Doesn't everypony change their accents when they get older?
Or just me?
13http://screensnapr.com/v/9p944Y.png just need to add a railing
I don't have one due to watching so much TV rather than talking to people in my area.
Everypony hug Polydunami
/me hugs Polydunami
Pinkie don't need no freakin railing.
Twi_Fi: sort of. it's more that, if you move or are around new people who speak differently than what you grew up with, your accent/dialect/way of speaking changes over time.
/me bonks Troll with rolled up newspapers.
If your location changes, then your accident might change do to you addapting to the new dialect.
lol, thats awesome Shizuka
Shizuka: haha
I wish I could change my accent to anything I desired.
Shizuka: that part of the video you were rendering the other night?
13yep
this grooveshark site is AWESOME... ive been looking for a place that had decent jazz in ages.
i have somewhat of an accent. though it coes on and of however it damn well pleases and everytime i try speaking it on purpose, i fail
Polydunami, is it time?

....
...
Monfang|Writing: eeyup, it's an affected accent, specifically a mid-atlantic one associated with high society types who made frequent trips between the US and Europe.
Argh, iris is bloody finicky on Firefox
Polydunami_: Here is your birthday present http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/96934

Da fudge?

/me runs.
Then why does she run?
Shizuka: to be fair, I've registered my nick, but I still find people using "rawrity" here on occasion.

13hm... twi_fi[2] is an impostor
why?
Dear lord, Val.
iris + firefox = a finicky relationship
Anyway, I am now 22 years of age
People don't want my name. They get calls from bill collectors and bounty hunters.
HAHAHAWHAT?
Val just feeling trollish or something, or did someone want ponies? :l
You gotta believe me everypony! I'm the real me!
That reminds me, I need to find a date place for me and Samus.
Polydunami: I'd suggest just using the link to the channel on ponychat's site, and keep it open in another window

:D
haha!
00,10wait, I dont know if RX-78-SweetieBot should be watching this
I learned that from watching Mezzo Forte
Man, I didin't want to thnk about that.

/me reckons he's seen the old guy in Megaman
haha
/me goes to google Mezzo Forte

I don't know how to feel about that vid.
I think he broke
lol
Lawlz
xD
lol, batou borked him
Someone needs to wear pants.
i love when batou says "hi" to the guy in the restroom
needs less clothing
What would be the nice way that Rarity would call a crash? A rough landing?
00,10also RAWRity thats why you get the realy advanced ones. that clean them selves
Twi_Fi: Im sorry i cant keep them on
Twi_Fi no they don't
All right, learned something new O_O
What's that.
Sumica like how ovens clena themselves?
I can't say on chat...
Monfang|Writing: Sound about right.
*clean
00,10exactly, but you can tell them to go outside and do it so they dont stink up the house like a self cleaning oven would.
plus there's maintenance. what happens if your sex robot's orifice motor breaks down?
then you're stuck humping a hole, like a glorified fleshlight.
Thinking too far into this.
Her outfit doesnt give her much protection
Seriously, iris can just stop crapping out
RAWRity, OH GAWD!
tell her to order new parts duh
Goddamnit
HAHA!
xD
i want a cyberbrain
me too
me three
nuh uh.
hello everypony
screw cyberbrains, they get hacked too much
Hai LightTrooper105
Hello LightTrooper105.
I dont want a cyberbrain cause I dont want to get hacked
any solar flares and you're cabbages
awww, looks like Daniel Ingram wasn't nominated for a Leo after all. Somebody doing the announcement made a mistake.
00,10that's what firewalls are for
firewalls get broke
i want military grade cyberbrain with equivalent firewalls
!dns 7086.in
Resolved 7086.in to: 98.232.197.62
!whois 7086.in
quick thought: you're in the middle of using your sex robot when their orifice motor busts, and it's clenched. You are now stuck inside your sexbot.
00,10then they have the whole cybermaze
Everypony here seems to be implying that organic brains cannot be hacked.
totally out of Megaman I swear
section 9 gets their asses hacked too
Sumica: firewalls = loops, loops = slowness
Thinking far into that, RAWRity.
Too*
RAWRity: Tell that to the doctor
all the streams are playing the same thing :(
00,10I have met plenty of people with slow brains
/me waves
That was kinda creepy.
lol
hmm
00,10tr that's cause they are all the same stream with diffrent chats
hacking eyes is scary shit
/me waves back at Mutterguy.
anyone know any brony dance remixes?
or originals
tr are you new here?
only been here once
tr Eurobeat?
Welcome tr ! :D
Someone else get him the video.

thanks
o.o
haha
any other good songs?
/me pours tr a mug of royal cider
Newcomers' custom
;)
00,10GTB vicecity
another thought: something malfunctions, and your sex robot stops self cleaning. Eventually, while in the act of operating it, you find this out when you hear its...swishing around...inside.
/me chugs the cider
What?
tr: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23666722/fillydelphiaradioPOPUP.html
/me notices the same 3 treea
No welcome video?
*trees
00,10RAWRity you are asuming gravity would not tend to that.
ah thanks lopy
np
00,10Smartcodes of the future
another thought: corrupt or perverted engineers or builders install a hidden camera in your sex robot, and your O-face ends up on the internet.
RAWRity, I can see that actually happening.
^
00,10why would they need to install a camera, it has eyes alredy
00,10just would need to hack the bot
yeah the eyes record...EVERYTHING
Sumica, true.
because cheap chinese workers
another thought: people create facebook pages for their sex robots, then tag themselves as "In a relationship"
and they can
Has Rainbow Dash ever crashed though a window?
00,10how about this, they hack you brain and make you the sexbot.
Okay seriously. To hell with this bloody embed
Sumica: then they have to feed you though
Goddamnit :[
I think all the times she crashed into Twilight's place, it's been though an open window, right?
there are several episode dedicated to robot relationships
and allow you places to poop/pee and whatnot.
also, STDs.
yay
if they're robots
Basically all the issues you run into with regular prostitution.
why would they need to do bodily functions
00,10cybords dont get std's
well if it's warm and wet yes they do
the get computer virus
Cyborgs get SDD's
00,10exactly
hmmm think about this
sup bronys
if they are cyborgs
Sumica: I'm fairly certain there's at least one storyline in the Teen Titans comic book where Cyborg gets gonorhea, actually.
Sexually Downloaded Deseases
Hai nettrilex
Ha
do they secrete fluids
/me rimshots
do they warm said fluids?
00,10dosent make it correct
RAWRity, Self cleaning
if so they would need a fuel source and fluid intakes
Yes, motor oil, lubricant
This chat......

All I'm saying is, the whole idea of sex robots is kind of shitty once you think about it.
00,10in this universe full cyborgs are just robots with a soul
Lithium Flower WOOT!
Goodnight Midnight_Tempest ;)
night Midnight_Tempest
RAWRity: Ain't ganna stop it from being made.
*sigh*
bye Midnight_Tempest!
RAWRity: Even so, I'd still prefer a real woman
if the cyborg vagina is wet and warm they are fully capable of capturing diseases granted their tissues are consumable by said virus
full conversion cyborgs have the original donor's ghost(memories)
Ah, Ghost in Shell. aka What ergo proxy WISHES it could be.
00,10realy it's the same for any "sextoy" RAWRity
Night Midnight_Tempest.
if they are composed of some latex they are incapable of holding diseases for a long time
and could be cleaned out though some means
00,10lets just say it's frealy as hell to find "toys" in a friends dishwasher
i love the music from Ghost in the Shell... and night again

Fun fact that might send you to listen to 'This Day Aria' again. During the second part of the Chrysiall's part where she sings 'But I still want him to be all mine!'. She closes one eye and focuses one on the camera.
and that'a the way the cookie crumbles!
Mutterguy: lol
You know, I should rest up for tomorrow; it's going to be busy as you can expect :3
Think about how that would look straight on, someone looking at you with one eye. Crazy, yes?
Goodnight everypony and I'll maybe see you tomorrow ;)

Ok, I'm done for the night.
Tomorrow, flashback and the letter.
It's not night time.
4X stands for eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate
It is here.
3:47 AM
sword of the stars is 4X, for example
11,02I'm a pony, but I like pretending to be a cow ;~;
SuperBrony64: O U
Susu.. think MOO, Civ, Alpha Centuri and Masters of magic those are 4X
silly filly
Monfang, mah gawd!
"Microsoft will reportedly debut a new Xbox 360 and Kinect bundle with an initial cost of $99 "
By this evening, I should have Rarity's chapter finished and start roughing out Pinkie Pie's
Sumica: can you customize ships here, or is everything stock model?
yay
moo..
there might be a case for this to be called real time 4X game
i cant wait for the rebellion expansion! :)
How much fuel does that ship use?
Must be expensive.
http://i.imgur.com/717MY.jpg
Sumica: naw, i'm talking about modular shipdesign by plaer. ingaem and all. there's an interesting game coming up which has that. legends of pegasus is it called, i believe
first capital ship is free

lolol xles
bummer
Monfang, Duties?
Duties?
:)
k never mind
What?
I was thinking of a fan fic
sumica are you a fan of megaman?
Was it mine?
if you didn't recognise the title... probably not
sumica not even the nes games?
Who is talking? And no I mean the girl not Sumica.
Mine is 'To Befriend a Mailpony.'
Twi_Fi: The game
oooh
Lopy, yes, but who?
A play on 'To Kill a Mailman.'
Is it the computer for the ship?
Sumica: you might want to check out sword of the stars 1. but don't buy it from them. the guys who made it do not deserve your money
Ah, I see.
yay
/me might might play fall from heaven. I want's to play the mercurians
Sumica: Sooo.. u goin be playing diablo3 on the 15 :D :D!
Cox needs to fix their HUB On Demand.
I want ponies on demand on my wide screen TV
kk
personally, i don' getthe diablo 3 hype. i plaed the beta weekend and the gameplay seams rather bleak
Sumica: Then what games DO you like?
Monfang: they do have ponies on netflix
I think
RX-78-SweetieBot: yesh
Most of On Demadn is free
that the graphics are utter crap compared to similar games and still use way to much rescources only makes me dislike it more
Do I hear a TV in the background?
lol
oh hey, i saw ghostin the shell
I'm now a bit torn.. After this, I ether want to write a fic focusing on Celestia and Luna or a romance focused on Rarity with the song 'Uptown Girl' as insperation.
Da HUB
Monfang|Writing: Daayuum.
we watching ponies? i just got back lol
It broke
Ether way I'm going to upset some fans.
It's broken!
/me cries.
oh
the ponies appearantly dont want
Ether it'll be the ones who think Celestia and Luna are goddesses or the ones who ship Spike and Rarity together.
Monfang|Writing: Sounds good to me on both sides.
NOOOOOOO
Though now I upset people who refuse to accept Ditzy Doo as a name for our favorite mailpony
ha!
Monfang: actually, living for thousands of years and controlling celestial bodies is pretty much the definition of gods
lawlz
/me sees bit of Galatic Civilizations in this
Monfang|Writing: Dem rabid fans
Blow up the sun
DO EETT
Because who would enjoy watching their friends and family slowly grow old and die as you don't age a day?
/me controls the sun.
Mee
Monfang: doesnt change the fact that they are deities
sumica it should say "you are scrolling" "you clicked" "this is a game"
Dark, what is your definition for 'deity'?
it got away, those pirates must be pissed
How do you define it?
seems ok
visually
I would define a god as a being that could fundamentally alter my reality, not as an illusion.
Death wish i guess lol
wait it says ur playing halflife 2
haha
there've been a bunch of deities who didthat last one in human mythology
regenerating shields for the win?
so, what game is this?
uniting traits of all mortals?
BOOOM
it's a Blackbird!
haha
sumica how are u playing half life 2?
I am lost.
yes. there've been depictions of higher beeings being hybrids of sorts. don't ask me about examples, i'm not that good, but i remember having read aboutit. you might want to look at indian religion
Dark, I'm not sure what you mean exactly. But lets look at the facts that we have, ok?
JRP2234. wat
/me tags Twi_Fi, found you
Silly Sumica, Valve can't count to three.
Fact 1: Celestia and Luna have lived for longer than 1000 years. However, they were not part of the three nations during Equestira's founding.
Do you disagree?
alicorns are pretty much the ultimate being, unitiing the traits of all 3 pony races.
Excatly.
Dat planet development.
or episode 10
Monfang: true, they have bot been in hearthswarming eve. but i'm still having trouble with that, seeing how it completely screws the legend that we herd in episode 1
Not really
Not the home world
But moving on.
gasp
brb peeps
Okay SHane377|Shower.
haha
he can do it!
herpaderpA
Fact 2: Celestia and Luna move the Moon and the Sun (though the latter it's more of turning the planet to face the sun but in any case.) However, we know that Unicorns used to do the same thing without the power of the Sisters.
He just has to believe.
time to taunt the pirates for a third time!
Sumica, name the scout derpy
:P
Do you Disagree?
Knowledge acquired?
Knowledge is power
which game is this anyways?
Where your eyes don't go, a filthy scarecrow waves his broomstick arms and does a parody of each unconscious thing you do.
but yes, many godly beings have been uniting things that have been divided on mortal planes. the ones thatt seemed haf animal for example. also, the original depictions of angels also also do not specify their gender
build more overlords!
I'll take that as a no.
Monfang: i do see your reasoning
he's the best scout ever
This game reminds me of something, but I don't know what.
Dark blue and purple
HAHA
Fact 3: We have seen that Celestia is defeatable, meaning she is not all powerful. And that Luna did not know of the attack on Canterlot, meaning she is not all knowing. Omnipotence and being all Powerful are traits of a deity that they lack.
Do you disagree?
Sumica: "FUN"...........THATS MY LINE!!!
00,10FUn™
F U(n)
F.U.N
Monfang: many gods have been killed by mortals
Friendship is Magic: http://macromeme.com/dog/pig%20and%20dog.html
Trademark? does that mean i cant have fun anymore?
you can have fun, just not FUn
00,10F.U.N.E.X
and the thing with the omnipotence is pretty much something the more odern religions cameup with
Omnipotence and omniscience do not a god make.
Yes.
We are.
Then what do?
Dark_Horst, Monfang quit fighting lol
Yes, Sumica, it's srs business.
Is it?
What traits have wee seen that makes them dieties? All I see is a horrible curse.
Sumica: game designers recon that we are dumb at puzzles and makes them really easy
Its does remind me of starcraft
purple needs to go. they got access to the neighbouring system
Yes
Being a master of magic and all.
I think she could.
Sumica: do u like nes?
Wouldn't make it an Alucorn trait then, would it?
You read the same comic that I did, didn't you?
Monfang, though not the only path.
project starwars
With the next generation of the Elements of Harmony?
what we DO know about celestia and luna is that they can live forever, if nothing interferes wi
fun with tractor beams
by force
Do we really know that?
Monfang: The next trixie episode, she will be stronger then twi
Monfang: we can supect it
All we know is that they lived for a very long time.
We can make the 'assumption'.
However, we have no facts.
NO, you don't.
And I can prove it.
oh noes
Exactly.
...
woops
/me manly tear
Got too into it.
Lopy, Trixie would never be stronger than Twilight.
/me takes a deep breath and relaxes.
she was so young
Monfang: keep in mind thogh, that we also have noevidence to rule their deity status out
No evidence to prove it. No evidence to disprove it.
All a matter of faith?
Dark_Horst: That's the same argument I hear in religious debates, and I won't go into that further.
Vermilion: The fans want it
ohia SuperBrony64
aww
Kammerjunk: Excatly what i though.
poor scout
Maybe it's faith that makes them Deities. Well, if it can't be proven or disproven. Then this is all pointless. I'll write it how I want to.
Now, Twi_Fi
actually ancient mythology has been full of features that would define luna and celestia as gods. maybe of lower rank, maybe half gods even, but they do have deity status
I for one don't disagree with any alternative theories.
Monfang: ....
and that's my point of view, and i'll defend it with a pitchfork
Do you have friends or family you are close to, Twi_Fi?
opy, Trixie worked in illusion and show magic. She never showed and abilities to put her in Twilght's league.
Maybe a lover?
The only thing that suggests that Celestia and Luna are viewed as deities is when ponies say, "As Celestia is my witness!"
Lopy*
sumica u has minecraft
That actually reminds me of the way that European Kingdoms treated their royalty
'As the Queen as my Witness'.
Did i hear Minecraft?
Monfang: Yeah, that's pretty silly.
It's hwo they spoke
Monfang, yes.
they had it coming
I know. And it's pretty silly.
Mooien everypony :)
Well, good night everypony imma going to bed TIRED
Because it broke the second Commandment to use God as your witness outside of special situations.
Monfang: actually, the egyptians where the ones that saw their kings as gods
Sweet dreams, Lopy.
Night Lopy.
Monfang, that's true.
what is this game?
Invi: Deus Ex: Invisible War.
oh, intresting
Close enough.
I want to see Wrek play Invisible War some time.
Sumica I've heard it is good, but monotone. is that true?
who am i "barrr barrr barrr carbon tax barrr barr
Everyone you will ever love will die one day, and you can't stop it.
You will watch them all be put into the ground again and again and again.
Monfang: Doesn't matter, had sex.
Monfang, yes, but that is already happening now, except I am aging as well.
Monfang: i would laugh and be lost in nostaga
nostalga*
Monfang you might want to read Duties then. It's on EQ daily
Now.. imagion you start forgetting
You start forgetting the ones you loved.
Monfang: welp, you can either dwell on what you've lost, or look forward to what/who you'll meet next
Memories are already fragile.
Their faces covered by the fog of time. You start forgetting little things, then more and more until you an't even remember their name or face.
Monfang: But in all seriousityness, I would jump at the chance.
Monfang: if your forget then it wont bother you
Do you really think it wouldn't bother you to forget someone you gave your heart and soul to?!
^
Monfang: nope it wouldnt hurt at all you know what they say
Freddie mercury had it right
sumica after you play me3 or should i say get the color you want can u play the first one again
They might deal with it a few times, Twi_Fi. But you'll have to deal with it for the rest of existance, over and over again.
Sumica: idk, I look forward to my dreams
never knowing the sweet release of death.
Monfang: that's where acustomisation sets in
Who wants to live for ever? although under his circumstances it was rather sad
sumica why not
Monfang: time heals all you would eventually forget completely and it wouldnt bother you anymore
Actually, Susu, there is a sleep schedule called the "Uberman's sleep schedule", which is basically being awake for 4 hours, then sleeping for 20 minutes.
Kammerjunk: true, but miss one of those naps and you're screwed
Trufact.
it fucks the whole schedule
Heh, I was afraid this would go over a few heads.
what about the lack of REM cycles?
sumica you plan playing me3 today?
Twi_Fi: so you cant die of even outside forces or is it an old age thing
Monfang: don't you think that you're sitting on your arguments a little too ahrd
taking a break I assume
Not really. I speak from personal experience.
Fattonie: Your mind basically forces itself into REM when you fall asleep to catch up with what it's lost to make up for the deprivation.
I see
Monfang: elaborate?
I put someoen I loved with every fiber of my being into the ground. And now I spend many a sleepless night trying to keep my memories of her intact.. and I'm lossing.
mfw a lone spy won the round for blu on payload race http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4596/
true. but you're a mortal being
Monfang: So did I. 'Twas my dog. Can't have been older than 8 when she was put down to cancer.
and forgetting because the brain damge gets healed over
in our short live span, we don't have the time to get used to loss
Yes. So one day I will die and be free of it.
Get used to loss? Get used to it.
I don't want to.
Well, most people assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect...
Maybe time is not simply linear.
sumica time dont exist
I'd never want to get used to forgetting about someone like that. Get used to going to funerals. Get used to making myself move on and relearn how to live without them around.
Monfang: lloss is an important part of life accept it
Twi_Fi maybe. It could be endless or it will end somewhen
sumica there isent a beggining of time
Monfang: if it bothers you so than distance yourself from everything...
JRP2234[BACON]: Depending on your beliefs.
I lost track of all this. Where are we in the conversation?
FlootahShy what is time?
Why do you think Celestia and Luna stay up in their towers away from everyone?
They are distancing themselves from everything.
Monfang, I can see that.
Hmm.
time hasent been really proven to exsits
Of course, no living thing with a soul and spirit can stay away from some sort of contact for long before going mad.
Monfang: when have we jumed from them being deities toWNATING to be deities?
02FFFFFFFFFFFF
02I got to stage 5 of SA
JRP2234[BACON]: Time is relative, but you can still observe the progression of it.
02;-;
of course they keep to themselves
Kammerjunk i think for a few thousand years, it might be awesome, but soewhen it would be just a pain
it'S the logical curse
*course
taken out the pirates yet?
don't read stuff into that grammatical error now
gotta spend crystal to make crystal
grrr
...if time was proven then time travel might be a option
errk
Anyway, I'm starting to get depressed.
why?
And I'm not in a depressing part of my stories yet.
good rewards though?
Monfang: idk this conversation is getting me into a speculation mood
usaly if u go back in time ....its already happend before you even go back
Cryin's not for me. 'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'.
Kammerjunk lol
Would'nt we have time travelers coming to now if time travel were possible?
Kammerjunk wait for the countdown to extinction
im saying if you go back in time you cant change the future no mater how hard you try
because its alread happend
FlootahShy, who says that hasn't happened?
They say we do, but they are clever. they dress up like you and me.
Well, theoretically, time travel would include moving faster than the speed of light.
xmasskills, ah yes, that story.
if you went back in time to visite your self ..the pardox is that you would have already met yourslef
Well Time Travel is heavy regulated.
Kammerjunk: it could happen you never know maybe employing a worm hole could produce time travel
the rule implys that if you go back in time the pardox is it has already happend before you go back in time
Even republicans who normally hate regulation understand that Time Travel needs to be heavy controlled. Though most want it shut down period.
i iz back now
xmasskills: We don't really know jack about worm holes, if I recall correctlly.
correctly*
im back
I think a 15 yo is rewritting everything we know about things like that.
xmasskills the wormhole would destroy itself by light feedback
Welcome back Shane377.
I know he is rewritting E=MC^2.
I always wonder what if all historical events are just time travellers interfering with past people
Twi_Fi: just curious are u a guy?
Twi_Fi: or...?
Twi_Fi is an 'other'.
lol
Herm?
Invi: i have been lead to believe that wormholes are not very well studied maybe it could be possible
An other?
this kind of reminds me of free space 2... if it was a stategy game
Kammerjunk: a Shim?
Which, oddly enough, is a viable option on some registration sites.
wierd
I'm a *buysomeapples*
weird*
like i said if someone has already back in time, it means its already happend of what the person does. the pardox is the person who did it must goback in time to do so....its a loop
Twi_Fi: which are u lol
hmm?
/me can't say....
Do ho ho.
xmasskills wormholes are indeed not very well studied, because we didn't find one where we are able to study. But I've read books about singularities => Wormholes too
lol yd i get kicked is it cause of nick
ramming speed?
if so ok
00,10chage it fast i recomend
did
Invi: yea but they are not studied therefore anything is possible
When danger reared it's ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled...
Kammerjunk, lol.
whose seen Dress.mov
Memememmemem
I have!
lol
not me
i lolled at RD
sumica what is your say in the time travile pardox
Shane377, have you seen magic.mov?
xmasskills quantumphysics says too, that anything is possible but very unlikely. So the calculations of Hawking have a very high chance to be true, but they don't have to. It are only calculations.
Fair 'nuff,.
how bout u beep my beep u dumb beep HA HA HA SWAGGG
well said
dat cough
FlootahShy: ill watch it now
:D
dat drink
Invi: Well, quantum physics also say that until observed, a cat in a box must be considered, for all purposes and intents, simultaneously dead and alive.
I don't like quantum physics.
Quantum physics is magic.
Hello everypony ;P
Hello Resonantwaves.
Invi: hmm but i guess nothing is certain and any progress in that area is probably going to happen many years from now
Is it that quantum mechanics? I'm not even sure there is a difference.
Salve, Resonantwaves.
Hi
Remember me?
hi
lol hi
Kammerjunk quantum physics is awesome and you speak of the Schrödinger-cat. I liek that cat :3
-__-
04why are we so quiet today
lol
xmasskills if time is endless, everything will hapen. truely everything.
I love pulling a Schrödinger on my friends every chance I get.
Don't you think you had enough kid?

i knew it
Invi: if time is endless does that make parralell universes a possiblility erg srry bout spelling
you couldn't resist ^^
I couldn't escape from the ponys
xD
one does not simple quit being a brony
They were everywere
xmasskills: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse
lol FlootahShy crush kill destroy swag lol
lol
A parallel universe.....with ponies!
everytime i went on youtube they would always show up on video suggestions and stuff
I'll show you my multiverse (;
*gasp*
and my brony friend kept on sending me pony shit
ok!
lol
^ SO True
One of the multiverse hypotheses in physics is actually "Universes with different physical constants." I imagine fanfic writers everywhere rejoice.
Ponies!
Kammerjunk if the multiverse is real its possible that mlp actually exists in another univers
but i relise why he sent me the shit
xmasskills, YES!
xmasskills there are already parallel universes, in some of them, life exsists, in some not. some only exsist a few seconds, other last forever, so that is another sphere of ''everything''
lol what?
who is streaming?
xmasskills mlp can't exsist somewhere because 2D lifeforms are not able to live :(
sumi
except gems...
xmasskills: If the hypotheses that there are universes where physics have different constants, I would imagine so.
ok. What game is this?
called it!
Kammerjunk they only have different physics constants
if you have played zelda lttp and metroid prime 2 echos you might have a better idea of parllal worlds
I think he said Sins of a Solar Empire
Invi: Yeah, I was just throwing words out, seeing how far I could make it before somepony called it.
^^
xmasskillsx I tried to stop being s brony and then i failed :D
Ello there, everypony.
hmm would the universes that only existed for a few seconds do they dissapear completely or do they become a void
Oh hi, Malavolent.
Hello Malavolent.
Fattonie that'd e right
branes
What game is this?
.....
wait a sec
xmasskills it stops exsisting; dissapear completly
because i'm not here, Drake
thats it
also PMing me here is a baaaaaaad idea
04:I
04why
because I'm not on here as much as I'm on my own net
it go bye bye?
lol thankx
I'm always on there, but I'm not always here
due to school
bya dshannon
and CGI:IRC limitations
Can someone tell me what game this is?
yes
+ I can see what goes on here using my script there
be on less chans!
-_- not me the dreadnaught
/me hides
/me shrugs
is it fun :3
04o-o
I suppose you're right
I am on 161 channels, across 23 networks. I have 9 olines, 102 ops, 11 halfops and 11 voices. I have non-abusive power over 1310 people.
yeah okay
They're coming to take me away, ha ha...
Invi i know that know lol
I'm on about 11 chans?
To the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time and I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats and they're coming to take me away, ha ha!
I used to be on more
cut down on a few chans
what if all this speculation on this chat leads a brony scientist to create time travel
I limit myself so that i can be responsive.
this is more philosophy than science
also, less scrollback reading.
ambush?
thats a fat ship
lol
Yeah, I keep urging you ponies to become quantum scientists. I want my portal to Equestria, dammit!
ehm, indeed.
ehm: well that depends on perspective
somewhere (over the rainbow?) might be a Universe where Ponies in the 3rd Dimesnion are real :D
if you have played metroid prime 2 echoes it gives a good idea of parllra worlds
Philosophy with experimentation becomes science.
Well, they can't all be designed like a super-fortress
Invi: Did anyone say Brony space program?
Invi: No, it's somewhere beyond the sea.
Somewhere, waiting for me.
Twi_Fi: true true
LOLOLOLOL FlootahShy
What if MLP was created by the governmentand on 12/12/12 ALL BRONIES will be mind controlled to be soldiers :O
what if atlantas was an ancient pony civilisation
dude....you do realise you could also be saying there's a g3.5 pony universe too?!
Shane377: i'm guessing you finished it?
you fool!
yes lol FlootahShy
Though discussions about the possibility of time travel and parallel universe could lead to ideas for experiments that could lead to grand discoveries.
Malavolent we could do it like the Star wars guys in the book: send a few people in a random direction and see what happens xD
Oh, I thought it was exploding
D:
nooooo
Im waiting for Diablo 3 :(
Twi_Fi how?
*dies*
xmasskills: don't you think that's a bit much?
also... those credits
I'm waiting to follow the worms.
Invi, discussions could lead to considerations of new ideas that others had come up with that weren't considered before.
wait is that an AI? or is this multiplayer?
Fattonie: no he knew to much i had to make certainhe stayed down
Invi: Yeah, we raised 2000$ for tv spot, space program can't be that much worse, right?
For a moment there, I thought you said "Let's make a little hard-on on them."
lol
xmasskills *cough* *cough* All I wanted was Diablo 3 *cough* *cough* *Dies or reals now*
xmasskills: nah, something just tells me you like stabbing things a little too much
ohhhh sexy
Twi_Fi that's right. discussion lead to new ideas, but this is so far in fiction, that we are not even able to find the right conditions for experiments.
AI
it's too special
/me suffers mental breakdown
o.o
hi Resonantwaves ^^
Hello :D
Invi, yeah, if we knew more about higher mathematics we could make some more reasonable arguments.
You know what I want? Virtual reality
xmasskills just joking brah Im wearing a bullet proof vest made of doughnuts :D
I really want proper virtual reality already.
HELLO Resonantwaves.
Hi Twi_Fi :D
Twi_Fi and that's exactly the point: we only can make calculations, but we don't know if they are true. it is very likely that they are true, but they don't have to be.
Invi: 2+2=3
D:
NoOoOo D:
Kammerjunk: not true everyone knows 2+2=fish
/me screams "whyyyyyyyy!?!?" :P
2+2 = 42
Kammerjunk quantum fluctuation makes it possible :D
macro is important
2+2 = 3000
I din't get to sell him my doughnuts!! :D
Oh hi, SuperBrony64.
2+2 = 100
2+40=42 42=answer to question of the universe, question of the universe =2+2
is there ground battles in this game?
how's the sexy space station doing?
11,02Ohai O.O
11,02I got disconnected :/
I wish I knew more about mathematics and theoretical physics.
Mooooien SuperBrony64 ^^
so 2+2=42 is question and answer to the universe
I want to buy this game, but I need to save my money for a new recurve bow.
:/
11,02Moo :O

11,02I don't get them anymore, but the one time I got them recently to get Pony toys (before I knew they could be bought separately), it sucked because you only get 10 french fries, the apple slices are dry, and the buns of the cheeseburger were stale...also it wasn't a pony toy I got :I
/me is trapped in limbo cant be revived
we are the pirates who don't do anything; we just stay home, and lie around, and if you ask us to do anything, we'll just tell you...we don't do anything
@Ninjazz I feel silly :P
SuperBrony64: Not... Cool. :|

@dedxmasskills-holy shit i thought ur dead
So close to breakfast. I wonder what kind of bagel I'll get this time?
oh wow i didnt know the voice of Queen Chrysalis voiced Trixie O.O in MLP

I should have went shopping.
Now I can't make any foods.
or Cadence Confederacy
Invi: their the muscules that control ur bending and twisting of ur wrists
what food do you have Twi_Fi ?
Its would be called the Chrysalis Hivemind
gotta be SOMETHING
d3rb, mushrooms and an orange.
Shane377 uh, wat?

A long time ago, when Celestia and Luna were still very close sisters, Discord arrived in Equestria. This time not to just cause a little bit of chaos.
But to sow the seeds of love.

Ninjazz: Well, the New Lunar Republic weaponshield actually says "Vivat Nocte", but that's gramatically incorrect.
I love planetary bombing. Just thinking about the damage you do...
But yeah, it means "Long live the night."
Kammerjunk: I am not in support of any of the warring factions so I wouldn't know.

The worst kind of pirated

When I was just a baby, my mama told me "Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns." But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.

So, did I sleep through the end of Mass Effect 3?
may not advise that
Food is my enemy.
I shall eat it!
Twi_Fi: Why so? Toast is food too, and so as nom.

I want toast but no toaster, what do?
Twi_Fi: You got a microwave
Yes

Twi_Fi: You know what to do.:D

yay
yay genocide!!!
yeah, I was disappointed to see that in physics class
or generally seeing stuff in space...
We should ask SpaceX to do experiments on what something blowing up in zero gravity would really look like.
everypony should have one
So the support has gone up from 35 to 242 since i last saw it
Sumica i like that star was explenation better: they shoot energy which maifests slowly in light, so it appears like a ''bullet of light'' ^^
I do believe that he is massing a fleet in the next system.
... i watch too much star wars...
According to NASA,wherever the explosion comes from is also the center of gravity, so most of the exploding mass collapses back into it's source.
Kandarihu|Mourning in space yes.
Kandarihu|Mourning but if the explosion is strog enough it doesn't collaps
still not a damage upgrade
cleansing is magic
thats it?
Well, by my theory, if the explosive force exceeds the gravitational effect, then stuff should at least be DRIFTING away as long as the force lasts.
Mutt you mean the battle for the Deathstar?
so close
I'm sure NASA has thought of this themselves.
will pursuit?
Is there a good faction to play as in this game? Or is this it for this game?
There are three.
Ah, okay.
But I can't really differentiate among them.
So they're all evil?
Ehhh.
Well...
Yeah, what Sumi said.
Basically, Humanity is best pony.
Woot? What s this?
Mutterguy do you mean the fight for the deathstar?
I wasn't able to follow what Sumica said while the crazy lady was spouting potentially mission-critical information.
lol
^
He meant the factions, Sumi.
Oh. I thought he was answering my questions over dialog.
Oi, anyone around here live near the woods in the south?
Supposedly, basically all race is fighting for themselves.
So, evil vs evil vs evil?
I want to compare experiences
Eyup.
Kandarihu|Mourning like in real life ^^
Which race has the strongest ships?
Invi: not like in real life.
Lets just consider everyone is evil.
wait, what do you mean by evil?
Kandarihu|Mourning ok, mostly like in real life
But for legitimate reasons.
LIke True Evil or just bad according to social standards?
Not like true evil.
Think this, guys.
WAR
Nothing is good about it.
Except it frees nations and peoples.
Ursups dictators and stops mass murders of people.
Monfang: Yeah, that's what they say.
It just happens and you HOPE in the end, SOMETHING good comes out of it.
so can diplomacy *snickers*
Monfang: How many times does that really happen though?
Well, the real good guys are the ones constantly being slandered everywhere.
Or do you want individual cases from each of those?
You need to think on both side of the coin, Monfang.
Oh?
You can't just go to war and make everything better.
Why not?
Well, thats the hard question isn't it.
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/nyregion/at-92-movie-bootlegger-is-soldiers-hero.html
I like this guy already
You can't just explain the "need" for war.
Yes I can.
Well, capitulating to everything just means you have no say in anything.
Exactly.
Capitulating?
There are things that are worth fighting for, such as freedom.

Pony way = anniliation of a planet
I like this song, but TDA is still my favorite.
love is destruction !!!!!!
derpy_pony desintegration spell xD Spaceships are unicorns ^^
You did it, OtakuTom?!
Think of all the familys you are killing with this song...
well, I guess if a wedding involved a starbase blowing up, I'd say it was the best too
hello all, what game is this?
/me smiles
Another great song to kill familys to.
My name is Pinkie Pie.
pie
hello!
the "love's in bloom" chorus sounds too much like KC & JoJo - All My Life to me
And I am here to say.
Sumica are you going to be blowing up any planets? like COMPLETELY?
She (unintentionally) did a perfect impersonation of Rainbow Dash..."Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh" before saying yes XD
Thsi song hates you sumica
Sumica 20% cooler space?

Sumica can you build a Superweapon too?
Monfang|Youtubin, there was a time where many fics were bombed with poor reviews.

Monfang|Youtubin, it might not be a similar incident, but someponies are just jerks.
Build the orbital friendship cannon
I'd take poor reviews over no reviews.

blurrrrrrrggghhhh
G'morning Monfang
pony_3598: yes
Or afternoon, I forget which.
pony_3598 and ghostbuster_EXTREME, you both seem to be, like, one pony!
Ninjazz: I've been here for a bit now, but thanks nonetheless!
ghostbuster_EXTREME but often you sound like one
Winter Wrap up, Winter wrap up!!
Can I talk to him?
I wanna talk to him.
Please~
Winter Wrap up, Winter wrap up!!
thats because hes...
My pleasure, Xera.
...me
Probably because they are the same pony.
Creepy.
Twi_Fi: they are.
*gasp*
I love this song <3
:O
/me well what fun is there in being one pony/ Twi_Fi
Stick to one client, ghostbuster_EXTREME.
Literally, they have identical IP.
So do ether one of you consider yourself a troll?
DISCOOOOOOORD
I would never pretend to be more than one pony on chat.
There's no either one, they're just one dude.
ghostbuster_EXTREME is a changeling
i find this very....
....interesting being in 2 place at once
Whatever did we doo
The sun is in the sky!
Could you please stick to one nick?
ok
This song. :)
It must be a strain on you though. Why not pick one and use it. We would hate for you to get a headache from it.
Cupcakes...... *Shudder*
i like the metal version better ^^
It's not exactly hard
Yes!
To juggle chat clients if you line them up
there pony 3... is gone
/me sings along, is too Pitchy.
There you go, must be a lot easer for you now.
Thank you
Dressmaking's easy!
I mean, it's just typing
though you can't hold the illusion if someone uses /whois
pony_3598 just left without saying goodbye, how rude.
prepare a victory song
so im not a troll ok...
Ok
That was odd.
Oh I know, pony_3598
is a jerk
Kazumi Evans has a wonderful voice :)
Twi_Fi: He's still here as ghostbuster_EXTREME
Guys, Ghostbuster says he isn't a troll.
So please stop calling him that.
Twi_Fi he is a changeling
ghostbuster_EXTREME is a troll!
@DISCORD---->http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=xPfMb50dsOk
Captain_Obvious said so, it must be true.
ghostbuster_EXTREME: Why do i not believe that?
ghostbuster_EXTREME, you may not be a troll, but I suspect that pony_3598 may have been.
/me sees epic space battle then realises a 3rd is mines
/me there is some excellent chaos in this chat hahaha~
so many clones... hello again, Spectrum_Rush
Twi_Fi: Not sure if grasping the situation...
heh...because i said your friend was dead
good morning all
pewpewpewpew
ghostbuster_EXTREME is a douchewad!
hai ehm
Hey Litwick.
Allo Litwick.
Litwick, welcome.
Ghostbuster, why did you say that?
moin Litwick
Hi, Litwick

Meanwhile, :D, sorry I was having too much fun.
Needs to about 20% cooler.
Dat Meme
ghostbuster_EXTREME: Not only once or twice but 50 fucking times. It's not funny you know??
dat Captain_Obvious
Water is wet!
Cherry, relax. No need to loose your temper.
well sorry...
Monfang: lose*
Ha.

Meanwhile is a grammar nazi!
i will read it
Water is wet, the sun is hot, and ice cream....is delicious.
CrazyCherry: you're actng..well crazy stopit
:D
flutter_spin: I did :)
There, Ghostbuster appologized.
lol some peoples these days on facebook
Here comes soul.
Twi_Fi not every ice cream....
ghostbuster_EXTREME: You're forgiven, but i'm still pretty mad.
Aren't we taught to accept apologies?
fool you are Randomnerd. I didn't post it yet :P
make me facepalm so hard some times
Invi, HOW DARE YOU!
Does anybody play SoulCrash?
Shane377: Yeah, I've given up on Facebook.
Remember when Pinkie Pie meet Gilda?
I only just started playing the stream, what the hell have I gotten myself into? Hahahaha
Break a l-derp
Twi_Fi how about ice cream with liver taste?
lol i was talking on a school page made for my year lvl
Scootaloo cannot sing!
Invi, okay, you may have a point.
come on... if you dont care then dont pay attentiom to me n
I like liver!
D:D:D:D:
horrible song!
What is this singing...ow.
noooooooooo
I could use another liver, come to think of it....
Forced horrible singing at its best.
make sweetibelle sing
Gilda was very mean to Pinie Pie but she still threw the Griffen a party and was kind to her.
people really need to understand and indentify all levels of trolling on the internet
Any forced singing is horrible.
You require more minerals.
This is how I really sing......
Monfang and dto Fluttershy :(
needs DJAlexs remix
Never said it was bad.
Good day everypony =O
bye guys
Airpuff, welcome.
moin Airpuff
HELLO Airpuff.
Bye ghostbuster_EXTREME.
I know you didn't, I said it was.
Bai Ghose xD
Bye Ghostbuster.
Allo Airpuff.
and hence is while i prefer this stream to chat
ghost*
bya ghostbuster_EXTREME
Hes leaving?
Bye ghost...gone.
bai Airpuff
lol..
im not leaving xD
w8 wut
And that's how you deal with a troll
lol woops
Hahaha =)
lol
I always figured the way to deal with trolls was to ignroe them completely.
ignore*
Grr.. its killing me... im stuck at my picture.. not good with shadows =c
Rustled jimmies get in the way of everything.
CUTIE MARKS!!! :[
theres different levels of trolling i believe
Shadows are the obstruction of light!
Shane377 indeed
Hey, does welovefine.com ever have sales?
Just scare the troll by hacking him or something
So many ponies leaving, first pony_3598 and now ghostbuster_EXTREME.
trolling in general = the act of feeding of the hate of others
/me bonks Twi_Fi with a cinderblock.
Love Tolerence and mostly acting like you are a marshmellow
again, DISCORD ?
/me quite Shane377
-_-
What does a marchmellow do when you squeese it?
ouch
Monfang, sings.
Monfang: Squeal.
Randomnerd: I know they have promo codes, but idk about reg sales
dat pinkie song
DISCOOORD
Monfang: They make dresses.
Well I'm out. C ya later
NOt a Rarity Marshmellow. the kind you stick on a.. stick.
Bye Invi
BYE
Bye, Invi
l8r Invi
Bye Invi.
bye invi
What's brown and sticky? A stick.
bye Invi
What is this place, filled with so many orcses
/me wut ehm ;/)
These songs must mess up there throats
A marshmellow bends, it allows the pressure to be applied. But once it is gone, it goes back ot it's shape.
my gen of people are right in the middle of trolling and create yet half of people dont understand it
bai Invi
Fattonie: Thank you, I'll have to keep an eye out then. I don't wear graphic Tees, but I'll definitely buy the Cutie Mark Polos

You are never far away from a rat!
okie...
Dat dirty rat!
Captain_Obvious : define far?
You're fighting against AI, right?
And my dog is to morbidly obese and can't hunt/ track for shit
I couldn't imagine actual people fighting for this long.
Degu aren't rats but they are rodents, and I'm never far away from them. Because I wub them.
Mutterguy: the opposite of near.
Atleast by themselves.
Hmm. I need to word that better.
Ninjazz: People fight for a long time :(
Randomnerd: Yeah... :/
Donuts
Doughnuts, rather.
Has anyone played skull girls?
People are soooo violent, makes me glad to be a pony.

Do I have to be the one that asks it?
/me sighs
Meanwhile, is there anything you don't hate?
I hate this neighborhood.

You know what I don't hate? I don't hate Pinkie Pie.
You wanna get stabbed?

I do like vests.
I hate getting stabbed.
I like Pinkie Pie.

Da Fuk you say about mah momma?

Do you think Spike would grow if feed with Twilight's magic? Ya'll remember during the cutie mark episode where he gets a huge surge of magic and he grew into a gentle looking dragon.
nope
i dont care
chuck testa
Possible.
mhmm
Let it be done!
How'd that be for a season opener. We get a little bit older spike.
twi is vry magical unicorn
lel
If he is a 'baby' dragon, then his next form would be a 'kid' dragon
hes like, a ten year old baby
00,10such a cute little troll that was.
He just grows doest he? It not an aging process.
lel
...
teenage dragon running around breaking things
According to Zecura, Dragons naturally grow as they gather a horde.
*whorede
HOwever, we saw that Twilight was able to grow the hatchling Spike into a giant dragon with a surge of magic.
no, I think its horde
*whorede
i wonder how Zecorangot to the everfree forest?
For the hord.
Hord*
>_<
Damn it.
LOL
ok...
I was making a sad sad joke.
isn't she from africa thhough?
...
well. im super litteral
It's alright.
so?
Africa doesn't exist in Equestria
WAT
but Zebras are from africa
how do you know Monfang?
and africa is far away from equstria
Because Equestria doesn't exist where Africa exists.
WAT
We just don't know where Zebra's come from.
Zebras*
the real equestria is in africa :p
^
God damn you, fingers.
^lol

Work mostly in chicken
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hi, good morning everyone
Raise chicken Raise
hey
HELLO TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
I hate that show.
chicken arise
zecora seems to be a good charecter
GMorning everyone
mhmm
Zecora needs more screen time.
HELLO TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
mhmm
...
Zecora is billy witch doctor dot com's pony
ARISE CHICKEN
she's like the wilson to the tim that is the mane 6
But, you can see her FACE!
Btw, what was Applebloom good at during their episode? i know Sweetiebell was the singer and Scootaloo was a dancer, but I can't remember Applebloom. Wasn't it designing?
k ima go sleep naow
oh yeah
heh, wilson...
Monfang|Youtubing: Yes
set building
Night ponyj.....gone.
Applebloom should be hanging out with Rarity then.
Monfang|Youtubing: Ikr.
Applejack would hate that
Ehhh.
"You got her speaking all fancy like you."
Applebloom seems to be good at constructing things.
Where do you get that idea?
Their 'table'?
seem fair
And then, in the heat of the moment, when Rarity and Applejack are arguing, they both ki...
>.>
No!
Hmmm.
redoing the club house and tips on the set creation to Sweetie Belle
Shhhh
It was my idea and there is no shipping allowed in my idea!
I see nothing wrong with this ship. Net it sail!
/me throws boot at Twi_Fi's head
i hate them all....
/me drills a hole in the ship
ouch
/me patches it
they love you too ghost.
/me the ship is now made of diamonds
I bet you like AppleDash
floatable diamonds
/me gets diamond drill bit
Everyone likes AppleDash
I don't like any of them
/me shoots Fattonie
Thank God.
no i dont
I'd make up an original character if I ever have to ship them
/me dodges bullet...because I can do that
fine then
I patch the whole with my mind
THIS SHIP SHANT SINK
:p
MY CAT WON'T STOP SCRATCHING ME AND HER CLAW GETS IN MY NIPPLE! OWWW!
I think the worse shipping is when people write self-inserts and pair themselves with one of the characters.
what
That is all.
ok
ouch
...
/me is confused
*cough*
Twi_Fi: I would tend to agree, but I am currently reading one that is actually making a good amount of sense.
No bull shit at all in it.
sure
There are exceptions to every rule.
/me misses GilDash
Ninjazz, what's it called?
And it kinda helps that the main ship is Octavia.
But those only reinforce the rules, not change or break them.
...
bah
Twi_Fi: Sketchy Salad Synphony
It aint bad.
there are some funny vis here
hmmmm
But, its pretty long.
how long
If Gilda got one more episode, then GilDash would be valid. But for all intents ad purposes, I see Gilda as being long and forever gone.
Ehhh. Around 15 chapters.
Not everyone comes back, folks. Sometimes a bridge burned is one burned for good.
gilda is dead
imo
How sad....
I hope that Trixie stays FAR FAR away.
there r fic that r longer then that
I like trixie >_>
I want her fans to cry.
I really do.
The cry. :/
Srry man.
I think people need to stop treating Trixie like she has any magical talent.
Season 3 premier.....Trixie returns!
dun dun dunnnnnnn
She's a stage majicion. She does tricks and illusions.
It's bound to happen...
OH GAWD!
Monfang|Youtubing: No way man. She's insecure and deep down she just wants some love!
who is gilda
The idea for a fanfic just flashed into my head!
Or maybe she's a brat?
And it was NOT GOOD!
can't she be both?
Want me to beat it out of you?
What ever. I hate her.
i like how most people remplace canon for their oen head canon
*head fanon
ohai TGPT
who is gilda
The Griffion
Dashie's friend from flight school
...
The girl one
I stand by what i say a head canon is diferent to a head fanon
We have another griffon remember?
hai ninjaz

Oh ya.

00,10dat song
or thats later
lol
unsure
After me and my dad had a argument about my new computer he later figured out I was right
Well it is a fact that it is not the better shooters who live longer, but the ones who know how to use cover.
What about Die Hard?
Sumica: LOL
Ya'll know the scenes in cop movies and shows where the amazing shooter gets a tight grouping on a target and he survives most of the shoot outs because of it?
yoko and simon, sounds like castlevania
I am so happy right now
Well, that goes against facts. Really, it is the cop who was smart about what he put between him and the one shooting him that survived the most.
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa. Do I share birthdays with freakin Pinkie Pie?!

oh come on
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Daniel Jackson is DEAD !!
again
Twi_Fi : 'Tis but a collapsed lung.
Tumblr doesn't work for me :(
now its time for AppleJack Daniels
yay
So much violence.....
bah
Ouch, shot in the liver.
is there any entertainment media that utilizes streaming shows on the internet?
Huh?
pony_300 hulu, netflix?
You mean like Livecast, Shoutcast or the like?
livecast, yea
Twitch.tv
like we're doing right now even, watching Burn Notice with others
Well people use it for a lot more than that.
I was just thinking that it'd be a great idea for for like CBS or USA or something to stream movies and tv shows and have chatrooms... well, basically like this!
:'(
/me starts having manly tears.
its exactly why they dont do it
pony_300 they're too money grubbin to do that
because its a good idea
if they do that for free, then they won't have the monies
i'm bac, but i'll only be on for a short while
mmk
wb Litwick.
welcome back LightTrooper105
er... Litwick
/me joins and sees a Helicopter...this should be good
anyway HI :)
hai ACS13123
i remember this
BOOM
badass
on the otherhand, maybe this isn't such a good idea; if they found out a way to earn money through streaming, they'd probably start trying to lock down streaming so they're the only ones that can do it
true
swimming that far..what is this Grand theft auto?
and then he swims miles of ocean
he is..... BADASS
actually swimming that far isn't that hard
if you've got training
I swim that far everyday!
lol
and to be fair, he seems to be in pretty good shape
yeah, IF youve got training
damnit I need food, but I don't want to miss any episode of this
Playlists like these need intermissions built in.
Twitch.Tv and the like already have a business model for people ot make money off of streaming
And then explosions
It's what Totalbisket does to keep the chat craziness down.
5 miles is ok
5 miles in a suit, now that's a lot harder
Uakh, you swim race?
he good at thieving
Twi_Fi: used to
and triathlon for fun once
you are a crazy motherfucker
Uakh, damn!
inoright
everypony I know believes I'm a weak nerd
and a weirdo
I've lost muscles and stamina in two years obviously
hmm
but the techniques stay
I still swim decently fast easily
Uakh, that's good.
used to swim 2h15m a week
+ the occasional competition
..thats the good news...do they have great news?
lol
Think I should draw Chemical Plant next?
Dat food.
If that is really food.
suriviving in jail like a boss...
ewwww
so why did they arrest him in the first place?
surviving*
food in the army is way better
Dont drop the soap
HAPPY BIRTHDAY PINKIE!
Hospital food is the worst
not sure ekips
but then again, the only army food I've ever tasted was from the french army >.>
Not even sure if thats actually food
It's illegal to swim in a business suit.
yeah, hospital food is horrible
I like hospital food...
but Ill eat anything...
I'm gonna draw chemical plant now
so does this guy become part of the main cast
the one time I had to stay at the hospital, I chose to let myself colapse from hypoglycemia rather than eat the bs they gave me
hmm
lol
wow
I think ive seen this one before...

Dat Tensen
Slidy doors that require metal bending to open. It's the perfect prison.
mhmm Monfang
Well, for anyone who isn't a metal bender.
I'm kinda on the cop's side on this one.
im not
so is metal a element in the series now
Of course, they make sense.
No
haha
Zekorra
Metal is an extension of earth bending
shrug
no, its just advanced earth bending
alexxm it's an advance form of earth bending
its a bendable
same here pyrocatboy
Metalbenders don't bend metal. They bend the impurities in the metal
Smug face
thanks Dken2021
WHOA WTF
Your mother.
YOUR MOM
Sorta like blood benders don't bend people, they just bend the liquid in the person's body.
like lightning bending is just fire bending
White lotus...
Monfang: i thought they bend the metal becasue it's a pure form of earth?
blood bending
Heat lighting
Awww.
en.ntunhs.net/IPInfo/EN/57/32.htm this link is dead, it brought me to an error.
they bend their blood
:3
Back
Naga
bloodbenders... they be bad
meh
Nope, Dark_Horst. According to Toph, it is the impurities. You can't make a pure metal. it's impossible
herostar: given that SCP's are creepypasta, I'm unsurprised.
welcome back LTB
Wb.
Plantbenders are the same. You can't bend plants, but you can bend the water in the plants.
Unamused
water bender is best bender
okay, theres too much bending.
lol
Can't keep up?
ALL THE BENDING!
just fucking earth,water,fire and air
Giggity
She's strong.
Should watch the original series, 8470
You can bend the warmth within a person too. but lesser degree. ;)

HISS!
@dken I did saw the entire first avatar
PAPARAZZI!

When a fire bender makes lighting, they are making heat lightning. I'm not sure how that works exactly. But it isn't like cloud lighting.
KORRA!
Ninja dudes
well, its still a power source
NINJAS
god damnit it ended
pom pom pooooom
Oh look, it's that guy from the anti bending poster.
Something like a rapid increase in the local heat makes a massive static discharge.

NLABLALBLALBALABLALBALALBLBALBLALBAL

va I mean
for your interest, general definitition: steampunk is the concept of a world in which the combustion engine was enver invented. and with the usage of steam-engines, the culture also somehow stayed in the victorian era
what are the odds of figuring that out
lol
dat music
/me hugs Shamroc
Dat creepy cult.
you can't used black VA twice in 1 episode
13!espeon
haioh

00,10it's multytech
Incoming TWIST
can we stop arguing about avatar being steampunk or not?
Monfang: those are what define steampunk
/me cant wait for the new bethesda game
According to who?
03hm
Allll the eons
And now he's crazy
Monfang: according to every steampubker on the planet?
And this why Liberty is STUPID
dundunduh
03actually I answered my own question
03it will be a pain to do but I'll do it
03XD
I want elder scrolls 6 to let you explore tamriel
Monfang: according to every written definiton of it?
13?
And you can link me to where every steampunker in the world said that?
03hooking up an Xbox 360 hard drive via SATA to my computer
That's totally possible.

WAIT! That's the AVATAR MOVE?!?!
^
ZAP
Not specifically.
how is this steampunk monfang?
somehow he knew it
he cant bend anymore lol
cowvarkian: yes, but steampunk doesn't require that there's some steam, steampunk requires that theres NOTHING BESIDES steam
inb4 Amon is the real Avatar
Impossiburu~
It is an old style with advanced technology mixed in.
How much you want to bet this guy learned it from fire lord ozai
lol, yeah I know Dark_Horst

Wow Sumica...just...wow
you're still wrong Monfang
LIke he didn't like hurting bendres. Just wanted equality
i want to be on your back
02LOL, they're both the same
'It's powered by water and steam'
I guess Ill stop feeding you Monfang
Amon hasn't done anything wrong
yet
00,10keep in mind even if I dont show the ep live i will still get them to show later.
But seriously who wants to bet this guy is a relative of fire lord Ozai and thats where he learned to take beding away
bending
and when is that?
Sealing away a part of what makes a person who they are is wrong, MahBoi777
right after movie night?
00,10when i can
DaringDude: Interesting idea, but makes no sense.
