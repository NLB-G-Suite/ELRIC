Spectrum_Speed: You were kicked for excessive capslock. You should really read the message.
05im not banning you, im kicking you. stop breakign the rules.
^

Kicking must hurt
I forgot about this again lol
yo yo yo wuddup shibaru
05I am dead serious.
No not really

lol
Spectrum_Speed: Welp argue with a mod if you want, See how it goes
Spectrum_Speed dont go against a mod, you will lose
I know :D

Yup
lol
I've been banned from over 50 chats
Spectrum_Speed: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/ This will help.
And i wonder why
Can't imagine why.
thats not something to be proud of
No it wont
I downloaded a bunch of shit for it too
Spectrum_Speed what did you do?
haha
Cap sentence
i wish i could find that pic of wat happens when argueing with Wrek
I HAVE A DRAGON SIM
05if you have been banned form 50 chats, then give me 1 reason not to ban you on the spot.

but i didn't do anything
wtf is going on?
/me glomps Wrek
Yup
Bronysith Spectrum_Speed did a silly and annoyed Wrek
Bronysith: fun times
Chrysalis: really? ill get my popcorn
banning me for a rule is approved but banning me for nothing is pointless
lol which sims are u playing?
05times up, what is your reply?
Let me get my popcorn.
Technically he hasn't committed a ban worthy offense yet.
I dont have a reply
more herdmind
oh dearf

*grabs popcorn*
sims 1 complete collection
holy fuck wrek
/me eats icecream
cool
Wrek nuuu!

Chrysalis: thats my special flavor ice cream
11,01*shrug*
ive only played the sims 3
And he hits for six! :D
how many souls has collected this chat so far ?
darn it
may I ask who the music is by?
Chrysalis: boot to the head dear
and hes OUTA here
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL
and simcity 4 if that counts as a sims game
SCOOOOOORE
Welp good riddance if he got banned
Chrysalis: rage quit?
und now i can change back :S
and buffer
/me watches Spectrum_Speed fly out of chat.
More than I feel compelled to count.
Chrysalis: would that be bbbbbbBANISHMENT
05"I HAS BEENZ BANNED FROM CHATS 50 TIEMS!" "so you cant follow rules?" "CORRECT!" *ban*
poor Spectrum_Speed :(
cool
11,01Now it's 51 times.
Wrek: Who is the music by?
someone make that a meme
05Sabaton
someone
or that
I'm watching Bambi
To be fair, he WAS warned... A lot
Ban hammer?
Thanks
Wrek: perfect logic if you ask me
Wrek: Oh and claiming to have made one of the drawings he linked and his brother the with the other
no problem
Wrek he might of been joking?
CCCP: what is this "joke" you speak of
killerpony7733: still saved the AJ pic :D
thank you Wrek its good to be able to use my nick without getting confused for that guy
or exaggerating
CCCP: That's still no excuse.
picture is definatly looking good
lol nice
CCCP he was given ample time to show why he shouldnt be banned
11,01Even if he was joking, it was in bad taste.
Chrysalis: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0g93FEuCFuB
^
oh shit
MadSurge: Yep but it's just stupid and being a douche taking credit or giving someone credit that did not make the drawings
11,01Acting like he's proud of being a rule breaker.
i honestly dont know why he was banned though :C
Chrysalis neither can i
killerpony7733: no doubt about it
CCCP: Because he was breaking rules on purpose and refused to stop
it is good day =D
Nittany_Discord: IKR?
I told him to read the rules
uhmmm
CCCP: He was warned multiple times, and he persisted anyway
SuperBrony64!
mourns Spectrum_Speed
/me hugs SuperBrony64
/me glomps SuperBrony64 and Chrysalis
ohai sb
/me goes to the end of the chat chasing a tumbleweed
I didn't cry this time
I guess
MadSurge: So in my eyes with the attitude and how he tried taking credit for art he did not make, Seems like a pretty good reason for ban
Ohey SuperBrony64 :D
Hi SuperBrony64
Hi, SuperBrony64!
Gold_Demona yeah so have 100's of other people here
/me watches in mild amusement.
hi
killerpony7733: or at least a kick, but he really asked for the ban :D
that are still here
like me
CCCP: Also what killerpony7733 said
Und as usual I am confused by folks who start talking to people before they've managed to say a word.
/me uses a tnt brick on the tumbleweed
ikr
Meanwhile: :D
Und whats und mean?
CCCP: dude was alcapsing not heading rule reading suggestions and annoying evryone about nick stealing iei mine we tryed to warn him to chill out but he never listened
and
Hey SuperBrony64!
Und is German for and.
MadSurge: Pretty much. but yeah he was just painting a huge bulleye target on him
argh i cant pick the color i want for my room :P
I think most of it is just people trying to fit in tbh.
killerpony7733: and he didn't discord the banhammer :D
Spectrum_Rush he honestly wasnt that bad at all :/
Then there's the tryhards who just want to feel like anyone cares.
i'm german i has an excuse
05i can respect if you do not agree that i banned him
/me kicks the tnt back to kirzstryfe and disappears in the horizon chasing the tumbleweed
05but done is done
Purple
^
05no point in arguing
Pretty much what wrek said
ya but theres a couple different purples :P
okay :/
Tru dat Wrek
Apple turnover.
and a really sexy navy blueish thing
I agree with Wrek anyway :D
the pastry kind of pastry
he also lied about things, so not exactly trustworthy
AJIsAwesome: MUFFINS
or the edible type
I'm surprised I don't have many purple themed rooms
Wrek: I'm not. But just to let you know this guy said he has 4 computers so he might come back on a diffrent computer :S
AJIsAwesome: do cookies count as apstry?
Spectrum_Rush: Yeah taking credit and giving credit to someone who did not make the ART he linked
*pastry
kirz you need that explosives mod with the nuke in it.
Ponies47: just as long as he pretends that he's somone else
05inb4 he comes back and claims he's the one streaming
05>:3
hey I do that all the time
Wrek: Always seems to happen
Let me rephrase that. Favorite sweet?
always liked that bit of spiral detail you put in the horns Wrek
Wrek: Oh you! XD
Chocolate.
and i also have to pick another color for the other walls unless i want the same stupid sky blue for the rest of my life, and i dont want that :P
shokolad
Chocolate <3
Wrek: I really like your attention to detail.
Chocolate! :3
or i could just paint all of the walls purple, but it might be too dark :P
AJIsAwesome: hte pastry kind
idk
AJIsAwesome: ikr? Wrek is amazing at this
/me doesnt like chocolate though
well
I like some chocolate
One of the best artists I've seen out there.
AJIsAwesome: Look at Wrek's other work on DA it's amazing!
Ponies47: I'll take your word for it.:)

Two, One to hold it and One to draw an OC and wtie a backstory

I'll tell you why
So get run down by a car, stolen by crazy scientist and turned into a decoration you could wear on your head.
To get to the same side... >_>

Why did the chicken walk into the Buckminster fuller wireframe?
Why did the ponies became My Little Pony?

Evil_Golakka it didn't >_>
Chicken is always babby

To get to the other side!
Ponies47, hoy

I keep meaning to buy that bastard game

Golakka: ... If Zen is involved I guarantee there will be catastrophic problems.
G3.5 SWEETIE BELL or gtbo

Where's otakon? Not seen him recently
I cannot tell you anything about "The super secret "BUCK me harder!" plan...

Golakka: You know, Pony Zen.
Just rest assured, If you enjoyed buck 2012...
CrimsonPhoenix: What about SimGrettina?
OHAI EVERYPONY :D

hi BrOnyxia
BrOnyxia: Hello!
AJIsAwesome, he knows that everyone's always gay for Breaburn
My body was't ready for BUCK 2012

...
CrimsonPhoenix: You saw his new video, right?
For food
Hey BrOnyxia!
AJIsAwesome, yeah
I don't know why Darth Chicken crossed the road; it's too dark on the other side for me :S

>What's a Breaburn
2013 will be huge
Evil_Golakka, before I leave for tonight

Golakka: Quite possibly...

Oooh
Therefore, breaking the rules
Haven´t heard this one in ages
I got my nickname from the Greek language but I'm actually Canadian, eosforos
Golakka: That's nice. I prefer Braeburn personally. :p

GigabitHarmonie_Mobi i'm good, just a combination of recovering from buck
and gettin ready to move house
Guys
I'm giving blood this coming Sunday
Yesh?
Polydunami: O.O
Polydunami: Good for you! :)
no big deal
I'm back with pizza and a few chips
Polydunami: Sweet!
Polydunami nice! I would, but IIRC I need to be 18+
Some Micro chips
Serenity: What topping?
Welcome back Serenity!
I think that's the case
18+ and yeah, checked out
I get blood taken from me, like every month or so because of the medicine i'm on >.>
not really
Meanwhile: Not much.
Beautiful
Didn't think I would.
Oh, you mean mentally not a big deal. That's true
Polydunami: It's always nice to see others helping out. And don't wory, it's painless. :)
Hello ShadowQuill!
You are a good artust
GigabitHarmonie_Mobi: Hi!
Actually, this will be my third time giving blood :$
Oh, and I'm 15, but yeah
GigabitHarmonie_Mobi: Are you using an iPhone, then?
how much do they take from you?
So GigabitHarmonie_Mobi, how's Vivi? :3
Half a litre
ok then
ShadowQuill: Haha, iPhone, nice one.
ShadowQuill: No actually, on my laptop.
AJisawesome: Margarita
Now brb, for chat is ded
Hmm. The blood transfusion unit thing came to our school recently too...
I might as well give blood; I'm a universal donor after all :$
Ponies47: Last I heard she was having hard drive issues, thus her absence. :(
GigabitHarmonie_Mobi: Then why does it say Mobi? I thought you were trying to spell out mobile
Polydunami: Fair does. I'm still waiting on my next one. Had an opportunity on Tuesday, but thought it would be a bad idea after just coming back from BUCK...
XAX: O.O
As in phone
brb

Polydunami: That and the fact my last was in June and I've to wait 4 months.
Four months?
ShadowQuill: I did, but it's too long. I meant mobile as in laptop.
Polydunami: Or was it 3? :S
kk
Wrek: whatcu rolling on dark souls?
I usually have to wait two months before I can donate again :P
I
GigabitHarmonie_Mobi: Same, I'm currently using camp internet, runs out tonight
Accessing this site through a shitty lapto
Polydunami: I dunno. Point is I first donated before Download and that was a bad idea, so I thought I'd avoid a repeat. XD
Yet it's somehow still better than El shitbox
I understand
Is Colgate gone
Ill brb
Then again
Serenity: A camp? :) Are you enjoying some camping?
El shitbox is worse than anything
GigabitHarmonie_Mobi: Yeah, 2 week trip
People need my blood :P
1 WEEK AFTER TOMMOROW
Caps
Colgate on Bronystate keeps telling people to change their names to incog
Polydunami: We get the blood vans at my workplace anyway, so it's really easy for me to do so. And I get off of work for a little while. ^_^
Hmm, once again with the alcohol, huh?
Nice
Serenity: That sounds nice!
We have a bank come by every couple of months
Polydunami: What's your blood group, if you don't mind? Mine's "O-".
Well, it seems serene I guess
Same here, gildash :3
ShadowQuill: Why?
All the jockos are back at school now I'm sure
What game are you playing GilDash|Gaming? :)
O- for me.
So no noise
I just got back from mowing the front lawn. Someone tossed an empty bottle of some alcoholic beverage in my lawn, as I found when I was out there.
*"O-"*
Polydunami: I thought so when you said "people need my blood". Universal donors FTW. ^_^
AJIsAwesome: I don't know. BaconMane says that you will be banned forever if you change your nick to that
^^
Back
ShadowQuill: Alright.

I do have to wonder how hard invisibility charms are, given that the cloak is meant to be rare.

Meanwhile: Isn't it supposed to be the third Hallow?
The cloak is special, though
Wait, his hand's sweaty? Don't grab it!
CriticKitten: its also a plot hole
13WOOO my livestream was verified
Nobby growths, for her pleasure.
CriticKitten: Yeah, so indeed might be one of a kind. But apparently you can put it in cars.
all the strenght
Meanwhile: So presumably it's stupidly rare, which begs the question of how the Weasley family can afford it....
Meanwhile: i'd imagine that a cloak that moves all the time is a lot harder to do than a car which has a fixed exterior
Shizuka: Great, what does that mean.
Shizuka what does that get you?
strength*
I think the cloak doesn't wear off, however

13it's a weak excuse to get harry into the hospital wing to have a dobby encounter and witness the first basilisk victim
the scary part is not only re-growing the bones, but re-integrating everything else to the bone

Why is this so hilarious?
I mean yes, it looks cool, but any real reason?

flutter_spin: Oh. Ok.
Imagine that
"Devestate spell" is simple?
VVT? someone explain please
13tSparx: no the disarming spell is his signature since harry never aims to cause harm
what i'm wondering, why are there no spells to conjure, say, a cruise missile?
13thus why it succeeds against VVT whenever they meet
05,15Trailer scene!
It might sound cruel, but I look forward to when she passes everything down to me. She told me that herself.
Shizuka: and it ends up putting him in jeopardy because of that fact
Shizuka: I know he uses it a lot, like at Voldemort during the fleeing of Privet Drive
disarm = kill
What a ass
"Only disarm!" barrel roll
FUS RO DA
Sweep the leg
05,15Sweep the leg!
XD
Sweep the leg.
Wow he said Bonkers?
Shizuka: But when I think "Harry's Spells," even though he probably uses expelliarmus most, I think of Expecto Patronus

05,15Is the kid that prefers perl sitting in the corner alone?
You don't think they know BASIC?
Shizuka: Hermione is so totally an assembly hacker
13see it's "ay" when it's spelled "eh?", but eh otherwise
fluttercry: No that kid's beating the birch.

13i'm pretty sure we never see nick on screen again
05,15I think you're right
lol, "Can you try your best to unban me?"
13in fact i forget if he ever shows up in the books either
the spiders!
Isn't he at the ghost deathday party, Shizuka
moar spiders
13yeah but that was before this part in the book
Guess he totally ignored Wreks message.
I know he is in the books
Hah!
Shizuka who? I missed something
Oh wait, really?
05,15He's in the books, but I don't think he's in any of the movies after this
I know he was in the 5th book
I thought that was in Goblet
WHO?!!?
Canadian_Brony: Nearly Headless Nick
13nearly headless nick, after that basilisk attack i'm pretty sure he exits the series, book and movie
but wat about the bees, the BEEESSS!!!
WHERE IS THE EVEDENCE
GET THOSE FUCKING SPIDERRS AWAY FROM ME
Why are you bothering to take him to Dumbledore?!?
Shizuka yeah, he does
They just acuse him and they dont have any fucking evidence
dat pass

"SherbetLemon" is a great dumby password
You KNOW he's just going to ruffle Potter's hair and throw him out
Lol :D
i want an enchanted ukalayli
respond, i'll try then use the unban command
13i'd have to look though... i forget who harry goes to in deathly hallows to learn about the grey lady
Shizuka: He makes one or two more brief appearances in the later books, but you're right about the movies.
Shizuka: He shows up in Phoenix.
since you are no op then say "i did all i could"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hurdy Gurdy
13he goes to luna in the movie but i forget if it was luna or nick he goes to in the book
i did not intend to do that nor am i sure how it happened
/me eats some Sherbet Lemon
Ah yes.. the hall of presidents is always good for a nap
were near the middle of the movie
Shizuka: Harry wants to know if he'll ever meet Sirius
I went to Walmart and the lady in front of me was buying 50 Shades of Grey
' ghost
Shizuka: If that's the case we could assume the Basilisk actually kill-killed him. How would you apply the potion to a ghost?
05,15Okay I looked it up. He's in the books.
13ah that too
...with her husband
05,15but not the movies

/me pours polly juice potion into Nittany_Discord s throat
05,15I blame this series for the recent surge of anglophiles. and by anglophiles I mean teenage girls that think the accents are sexy, but have never actually heard most of the real accents and think everyone is cockney.
I love how they all just drop their glasses on the ground and let them smash, when there's a table next to them.
13CriticKitten: well crouch!moody prepared polyjuice months in advance, it takes the hairs/DNA to activate so presumably he could keep a years supply ready
Eww, bad cockney accents

:D
fluttercry I am so lucky I have never seen any girl like that
13and we don't know how long moody was brewing for deathly hallows

fluttercry I am a young adult male, and british accents are hot. Not cockney, but like, south London's great, Manchester's fun
Shizu: But Snape implies that the supplies were stolen RECENTLY.

Celestia Damn it Slenderman
WHAT RP???
WHAT THE HELL IS RP???
lol
Just to be clear, by RP do you mean going in-character or using the Me command
lol
How do you do itallics?
Slenderman role-playing
By Celestia's and Hagrid's Beard!
Slenderman: '/me' is baically RP
/me uses the /me all the time
Little know to the wizard community, Dumbledor introduced the Hogwarts Scarf because he was a secret fan of The Doctor
Holy hell
oh my gosh
/me isnt RPing though
I was bored. Hoo.
Its overuse of it
Major: gamer_luna's in Dashiesauce
Dr_Nick "/me" at the beginning of your message. Just don't overuse it
^
-__-
ohai DeathStar
/me tottaly doesnt overuse it
/me is bored and using /me to /me me
im eating ice cream
=_(\
o u
/me thinks that /me is great for speaking in the third person. Because illeism is fun.
Do you people have death wishes?
Who's doing the commentary?
Und dann people were dingbats.
I must appreciate the use of illeism as a word!
Slenderman Rifftrax
Oh.
But seriously, what's wrong with using Me?
/me thinks that being kicked for speaking with /me is bloody silly
not hermione!
Nothing until it's used excessively.
05,15Okay, next person to use /me gets a timeban. this is getting stupid. Let it go for a while
Nothing, but the OVerUse of/me is a problem
Illeism is one of the great underused words.
so tempting
11,01It's not that hard to not type /me
So who shall be the first victim?
see there voices get deeper
05,15If you do it to tempt us. Enjoy the permaban
Let's play to quiet game

Well, his fault for doing it, lol
Crossbow!

To be fair, the statement was made, cowvarkian was tempted, and knew what they were getting into
13IT'S THE FUZZ
he has the dawnguard dlc
Any other takers?
He was expecting people from student loans
13CHEESE IT
RUN
Shizuka dem slogans
oh shit, almsot typed in /me
I guess I just don't see why it's a big deal. It's one thing for Slenderman to come in and be all slender-y. But if I wanted to talk entirely in the third person, just as me, tSparx, why not?
My my here comes the fuzz.
reminds me of miles edgeworth 2
So will there be any other suckers to take the /me bait?
What?
13the phuzz
I heard a ping?
Spademagnes[R] no
05,15Because it's annoying. and most of all because the mods said so. Which, if you'll read the rules, is reason enough.
I hope not
13wow
Indeed
13fudge's actor
You know that I Nebbacanezzar.
13between here and phoenix he gets... OLD
13like that kind of aging that implies fear
13very nice
Fudge looks like he would make a good Bilbo.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Andy Price Interview on Celestia Radio Tonight!
Shizuka he also has the best line in phoenix
11,01Glad no-one flushed the toilet of secrets.
Nittany_Discord: i did though...
13Nittany_Discord: SO MUCH CLOGGING
05,15Xbox brah
Shizuka: Supertoilet.
13ah yeah he could be a good bilbo
Nittany_Discord: lol
So how the hell did people avoid flushing the secret toilet all these years?
I'm playing xbox brah :D
fluttercry I'll respect what the mods say. I'm not gonna be obstinate. I just hope the mods never tell me to stop using wink-smileys or something, 'cause I will get permabanned :/
11,01Bronysith: No!
The toilet of secrets secret is that it is, in fact, SUPER TOILET!
13i don't see martin freeman as bilbo... H2G2 ruined it for me
11,01Shizuka: Supertoilet of SEcrets?
1 hour left :$
:D
AAAH! NOT THE SUPPER CLOGGING TOILET OF DEATH AND DOOM! ...I has to say that.
SOOOOONG
Seriously, how did they manage to avoid flushing the special toilet
Oh god :D
13he's looking at us!
flluttercry: Their is nothing in the rules that says no roleplaying. The only related rule is no trolling. Trolling and Roleplaying are 2 very diffrent things
Harry Potter: The Musical
13WARNING FOURTH WALL BREACH THIS IS NOT A DRILL
harry potter ytp?
Haha :D
VenHur: the only person who agrees is sweetie poo
what is this
HE KNOWS
05,15Slenderman it's been a rule for a while. There is also a rule that says if mods say don't do it. then don't do it.
Shizuka and it isn't Pinkie Pie? TO THE BUNKERS!!
Dubbletroll knows!
Pyroid: Rifftrax of Chamber of Secrets.
dat cap
-__-
hahaha
13keep to heavy, let others play spy
Pinkie Pie and Deadpool could tear down the fourth wall
I still don't see what your problem with role playing is but whatever.
true^
Slenderman: There is a seperate chat for RP I think
Shizuka: Oh shi-MAN ALL BATTLESHIPS! IT'S A CODE BLUE!
YES
Presumably Fawkes is playing pyro.
miles edgeworth 2 alot
WHERE
13Slenderman: because bronystate is not your personal RP channel, make your own to spam RP everywhere
Slenderman: If you have a problem, leave.
05,15That music is pretty mysterious
I don't

the music is very mysterious

05so much crossover
11,01All of these storylines.

Why is this so fucking funny?
Wonder if one of those trees is Fluttertree?
13they keep that summer blockbuster vacation gag up through phoenix i think
I cant stop laughing
Spademagnes[R] Rifftrax
13at least through goblet
dat forest
Shizuka: You showing all of these?
so many spiders!
Pinkie Pie would start laughing her ass off right about now
13hope so
She has no ass
05,15yay!
SPIDERS?! Why did it HAVE to be SPIDERS?!
Pinkie has a flank and plot
Shizuka: You'll clip into the weekend at this rate though yes?
13might stop at goblet since riffs are a pain in the flank to sync up... and if comcast died midway we'd be out of luck
BIG DIFFRENCE
I love "Chamber of Secrets" on DVD cuz it has a game on it where you drive the car out of the forest. SO MUCH FUN
13you can't really pause a "real" rifftrax or you lose sync
Spidereses
Plot break.
earth defense force all over again!
Hello :) .... wait Harry Potter? did we see th-... oh its a riff :)

Is Aragog bigger here than in Hallows or is it just me?
Hiya Darf14
This is hilarious :D
13aragog sounds like a bag of potato chip being thrown against a chainlink fence
Well, Pinkie would laugh her [insert appropriate Brony-talk here] off
05,15Meanwhile he's bigger
hai Darf14
syncing these is a pain i'm guessing Shizuka ?
Hallo Darf14
hello :)
13it really is
Yah well we have to deal with it.
13you only have dis to work with
13mike does a "1, 2, 3, pause" thing for some cue at the start of the film to get you close, but you're always like two seconds off by the time dis shows up
could be worse, Harry might see 60's spider man
minecraft needs a siege mode
well Shizuka let me be the irst to say you've done a wonderful job doing so
I'm back and------WAIT! WAIT! Harry Potter again??? YES YES YES
13within a couple dis lines you can get it synced, especially after watching a few times (so you see what shots line up with riffs), but yeah
05,15Isn't there a thing on the site that syncs for you?
13the rifftrax i show are presynced videos from torrents
NOT THE SPIDERS
Wb Dark92Enigma
Spiders! Spiders Everywhere
having 360° field of view might be a little pain in the ass with basilisks around
13they have it but it's a DVD player
G'night everypony! :)
Horrible flashbacks
Spider Clowns... The horror! THE HORROR!
Night GilDash.
Shizuka: Yeah, I assumed that the rifftrax and video were one file
Gnight GilDash
GilDash: Night!
OH THIS is a Commentary video

Goodnight GilDash
13so if you have a file rip you're SOL with the autosync program

Dark92Enigma: But with a commentary for the LULZ!

eeeeeeeeeyup VenHur
GilDash: it's only 5:06 pm
Dark92Enigma: Yeah, it's a funny commentary made by a duo by the name of rifftrax
They should have brought that giant spray of Raid with them

Darf14 Arachnophobia, if you care
I think death would be a better fate than Azkaban
13the car really should have had a cameo in the climax battle in hallows
back to the forest!
^
SO that's why he didn't come back
13like
Shizuka agreed!
11,01Shouldn't give cars their own mind.
13come out of the forst
05,15That would have been fantastic
13with a bunch of mini coopers
13X3
YES
^^
It had babies?
BRILLIANT!
The car is too OP to be in Deathly Hallows
Shizuka: It could've driven straight into Voldemort after driving on the bridge while it was blowing up
Shizuka: Totally agree!!!!
i'd trust him
Shizuka . . . minus the mini coopers, but otherwise yeah
Running *next* to Neville
This is why Hogwarts should have a good law system... and Phoenix wright
That car went back to the forest, because Fluttertree needs it.
13magic car in the magic forest for five magic years? it could have kids!
XD
Oh no......please don't be like Evangelion.
Shizuka . . . hmmph
13X3
how did they not notice that before
AJIsAwesome: In what way?
13AJIsAwesome: naah voldemort never achieves godhood, not even close
:D
05,15WoW fanfics?
13influence sure but not raw power
Pheonix Wright is best lawyer
tSparx: Have you seen the movie?
Is Voldemort actually made up of the dead remains of Harry's mother?
Shizuka you mean "VVT", right?
13tSparx: End of Evangelion... probably shouldn't look it up if you don't know
Snake? Snake?! SNAAAAAAKKKKEEE!
HA
13SORRY VVT
AJIsAwesome: No, just the main series
Shizuka chances are, he might've found a fellow female
tSparx "VVT" get it right next tiem!
tSparx: lol?
AT THE FOURTH WALL
05,15AJIsAwesome is it the scene I'm thinking of that was really "F***** up"
THEY'RE STARING AT US
tSparx: What Shizuka said.
well everypony im gonna hit the hay night everyone *leaves box of muffins enjoy*
flutterchu: Yes.
g'night Thunder-Crescent

Darf14: Sorry, your Snake is in another castl- *looks at Hogwarts* Say, WAIT A MINUTE!
Gnight Thunder-Crescent
13that is hideous typography on that page
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, you could make one :P
Thunder-Crescent: Bye!
Why are we calling Voldemort VVT? Harry makes a big deal that we should call him by his name. Except the seventh book >_>
build a castle, construct canons
:D
05,15what was the retcon, I didn't catch it
13you never ever stick a picture in the center of a block and have the text continue through it
why are we watching harry potter i just joined
Shizuka IKR? It makes it impossible to read.
Dat thick plot.
When they said ''what they're <---- staring at?'' I THOUGHT OF THE FOURTH WALL
again
13fluttercry: that the basilisk kills by looking at you but TECHNICALLY none of them REALLY looked at it
the thick plottens

The DARK arts.
AJIsAwesome: i did but she moved

you could treat it as a minecart except with blocks
Voiced by Mike Tyson... LOLWUT?
13personally the brilliance of minecraft is working around the scale and level of detail you can get out of meter-cubed blocks
^
Ikr.
^^^^^
Tyson!? *plays Punch Out*
Whats this i hear about mike tyson
LOL
11,01Hell, just doing anything with the engine.
Actually, quite the other way around: Myrtle voiced Tyson in the Punch-Out remake for the PS2
greatness comes from overcoming limits

Dark92Enigma don't push it
[01:17:43] <Nittany_Discord> Good. ^.^
[01:18:26] well rules are ment to be hold i know all about it since im a OP on the Brony channel and stuff, and thats also why i asked since i knw how anoying it is to see people even if asked breaking the rules time after time
[01:21:17] <Nittany_Discord> Sad is OK.
[01:21:23] <Nittany_Discord> Blood and gore is not.
[01:21:46] I don't like such things my self
Reminds me of a Indiana Jones Temple
05,15Don't push it
05,15Woah

Baka-Neku: Because I'm blind haha
05,15wut
I spoke too soon :D
:D
11,01Baka was just PMing me about image link rules.
I just got a very large text-lag recover
Surely you can avoid creepers by making note of the fact that blocks aren't detached from the world.
Tom Riddle? Oh its all too easy, its obviously the Riddler!
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
^
hah, Tom was pinged
so wut happened up to this point? started at the guy gettin his head bashed in with a rock by ron lol
and he responded
is super afk?
I wonder if this guy would've played the Riddler in Batman Forever.......
PinkieSpice probably
ah
Sketch_Toku_Brony: So Tom Riddle is a ghost who lives in a journal Harry found
I had something to tell him ;A;
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Now they're down in a big dark tunnel with a giant snake and Mr. Riddle
PinkieSpice he'll be back.
Jim Carrey fits the role, but what if THIS guy would've played as him <--
ah ok thanks tSparx
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Np ;)
man, this L.A. Noire game is fun
shooting people, running over citizens, stealing cars
why is it so laggy and choppy?
i am the law
No! He is "VVT"!
HERE COMES THE ANAGRAM
Oh yeah, why is he VVT?
WWWWWHAT A TWEEEEEEEEEST
ah SNAP
I am lord smellywart
So if he could actually /use/ the wand, why didn't he just kill Harry with it?
I don't get this VVT thing
LOL
What a Twist! :O
mrganaa
dat twist
Where do those letters come from?
its a anagram of his oringal name
Meanwhile good point.....
tSparx we saw the riff of the 1st movie last night. Hagrid said he was "VVT", so we picked it up.
i am so sorry D:
i wanted to hear it
Ah, I see.
PinkieSpice: DUN DUN DUUUUUN
Guy Fawkes
Loyalty
fawkes to the rescue
I was in&out last night

Philomena? When did you get here?

Still, where does HAGRID come up with VVT?
A SONG BIRD.....AND A HAT IN A CAT
the hat will win against the snake
Speaking of giant spiders, there's one on my floor. Brb.
Meanwhile: Haha, gl
dat is a huge... animal
Meanwhile tell Dr Smith i said hello!
Meanwhile: Don't let it near your face!
thing you have to be carefull with in minecraft when adding blocks is wether or not its functional on its own
ROAR
dat trip
Meanwhile: just kidding
thats a bad way to word that
Phoenix > Snake
haha I used to have heelies :D
MY EEEEEEEEEEYES!
you cant just slap a 'do this thing' block into the game
I wanna go rolleskating now xD
05,15Also, I found out the hard way that if you have mods with nukes...don't set off 45
How cunning
XD
MLP_Brovakiin: I never understood the point in heelies.
lol i knew it
Is it a rule that you alos be stupid when evil?
i am signed up for the new comic book anypony else getting it
ouch
dat pun
ugh, I feel like I should put in a semi-long explanation of how snakes track their prey.
grate
so here it is
but yeah, blocks have to be componants for things
spitfirecolt: What comic?
Barbetos: Not always.
dat teeth
with tongue
DEM TEETH
Just ask the Spiral/Helix King
Sorry
the new mlp comic coming out in nov
Apparently the snake doesn't have any sense of smell
SONIC says ....I'm over there
everything smells the same down there
<-----
raw sewege
lol
Barbetos: Or Jigsaw. VVT himself is pretty smart, though Riddle isn't.
spitfirecolt: I heard about that. Maybe.
CriticKitten: plothole?
ill be right back
if you make a 'do this' block you prevent anyone from being clever and combining it with other blocks
I do like smart villians, and there aren't enough of them
i preordered the boxset
^ box set for what>?
Buytoast: Maybe to you. Animal senses, especially smell, tend to be pretty good at that sort of thing. :p
Get it? I'm over there! <---- NEVERMIND
tSparx: I like fun villains the most.
:D
11,01How is he alive now?
EXTRA SUPER ALIVE!
Oh look, a MacGuffin
soul stealing is all the rage
magic sword!
05,15I read Box Set as "Bot Sex".....damn my eyes
Snakes use their fork-like tongue to "smell" the air, and special sensors under its eyes to track prey thermally.
AJIsAwesome: Well actually my fav villians are morally ambiguous ones. Magneto etc. (though he's pretty evil), Rossiu from Gurren Lagann
Nittany_Discord: IT's supossed to be a memory......magic i guess
(for a few eps)
Frostmourne!
so why didn't voldemort just use basilisks to attack in the last movie
i mena hell
he could've kill them all
i liek poniez
Nittany_Discord technically, he isn't. Think of Moaning Myrtle, just more life-like.
Buytoast: That shit's expensive!
one you cant bring something ded back
tSparx: Obviously Discord for me and Hades from Kid Icarus Uprising. Know any fun villains?
05,15Dat Mr. Bean
Buytoast: Also they're really rare
Buytoast: Obviously he only had one small snake, an army of shitty wizards, and absolutely nothing else.
stab stab stab
FATALITY
Absolutely. Nothing. Else.

CCCP Not my thing, I personally don't care. Just letting you know ;)
SHUSH
that should happen to the Twilight books

Thats a good point, what if the book suddenly fell in a fire or something?
13WAS one of the horcruxen
ah i see
tSparx thanks
*gasp* SHE'S SUDDENLY TALLER! :O
I love how they have to explain later on that the book was destroyed so stupidly easy because basilisk blood is LYKE SPR DANGEROUS YO
oh crap this error
SB64 I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark and say you are SuperBrony64, but because you're mod account is logged into one computer, you're using another computer with a similar nick. Is this correct, or are you playing silly with us?
Anyway, I'm off, later everypony :)

Goodbye SB64

cept im not sure how it would EXTRACT THE POSION
THAT explains EVERYTHING :O lol
13and healing phoenix tears are never mentioned again
Shizuka eeyup
Shizu: They call it the Aeris Effect
http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/334900_o.gif
lol dat phoenix have a lot of strength
Or is it Aerith? Either or
13i thought the aeris effect is a certain macguffin works every single time EXCEPT when needed most
05,15Is it just me, or is a lot of HP writing VERY lazy?
basilisk venom is one of the few things that can destroy hocruxes, throwing it in a fire or a toilet wouldnt have worked
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
13i.e. phoenix downs
Shizuka they were used for this chapter........and never mentioned again Aeris Effect much?
Nittany_Discord: needs more phoenix down
ASScabin lol
shizuka that's always been my understanding
11,01Phoenix down maid outfit. So soft.
Break a thousand rules.......get awarded?
11,01XD
LAWL
But
13well they mention aeris more as they interact with the lifestream i thought
Nittany_Discord: you are welcome
But...

05,15just sayin
tSparx: IKR?
13nah
13ff8 did
:D
Shizu: It can also be neatly utilized by bringing an extremely powerful macguffin into play to rescue a character, only to never use it again because no one else is important
00,02what the shit
13never managed to finish 8
how many dillects of klingon are there?

00,02'bonjour', an apple thing
Hey, ff9 was awesome
:[
DoctoDoctorWho: How is KONG doing?
05,15After 7 it just went bad
00,02wants me to close xchat before i can uninstall it
i thought FF8 and 9 were fime
ff8 was fine, but the fandom over 7 ruined the searies i think.
flutterchu: 6 and 7 are the peak of final fantasy
Never liked Final Fantasy.
13Phase4: eeeyup welcome to apple!
00,02how does that even work
i liked FF4 on PSP,fun game
how did we get into Final Fantasy?
I like FF, just wasn't into it.
just askin'
I was looking at the Guest Riffers, and I was jawdropped that Weird Al and the TGWTG crew was guest stared on Rifftrax!
no clue
Shizuka: You take that back. I've got no problem with FFVII, but 8 (and 9) had a fantastic story, great soundtrack, good gameplay.
fluttercry: 6 and 7 are the peak of Final Fantasy man
Canadian_Brony: BECAUSE of the Aeris Effect
13bonjour is apple's networking platform i think, probably has hooks into the NIC that xchat is holding open
05,15FF6 is best FF
Dark92Enigma . . . and that is?
IM EATING TACO'S BE JEALOUS
flutterchu: yup. and chrono trigger is far surperior to that
138's music was okay but... ughhh they needed a new protagonist than Cloud part deux
I'm dead serious, I has proof.
Albus the wrost discord. :U
fluttercry: and chrono trigger is far surperior to all final fantasies
05,15Yes
Dark92Enigma: kinda quiet, its actually sorta bland compared to bronystate but I keep an eye on it, :3
I agree that the best FF's were pre-VII, but
FF6 AND FF7 ARE BEST ONES
i think a lot of people just hate on FF8 because of spoony and have never actually played it
lol is that David Bowie from Labrynth? :D
11,01I never played most Square RPGs :<
05,15Shizuka also drawing magic.
13cloud's character development was good and did great with the flashbacks and his faulty memory
11,01Except Super Mario 64.
:P
Bronysith, FF3
13but we really didn't need his personality all over again with squall
=_=
11,01I mean Super Mario RPG >(\
Eulshy: that is final fantasy 6. the one with kefka
/me kicks the sleeping SuperBrony64
Shizuka: or every character after :S
Canadian let's say....Deus Ex Machina used at the climax of a movie......never used in any sequel.....pretty much frequent in Final Fantasy. Hence the similarity
13haven't played any of the other FFs
My favorite Final Fantasy is Chrono Trigger
;A: darn you. Right when I have something awesome to tell ya.
13VVT
Bronysith, i ment the actual FF3
6_9
I feel heart broken
Well, actually, my fav Square game has gotta be Threads of Fate
00,02Q.U.B.E shows up as 'My Game Long Name' in the add/remove programs thing
hi ShadowDash
13lul
PinkieSpice: We're trying to take it easy with the RP. We went a little overboard today.
Shizuka: you havent played final fantasy 6?
hi
Dang my brothers laptop and his broken battery which will loss power right away if you unplug by mistake >_,
*>_<
g'evening everyone :)
HI
hai ShadowDash

Hey PinkieCupcake

hai PinkieCupcake
lol AJ
And he would have gotten away with it too, if it werent for us meddeling kids and your house elf.
AJIsAwesome: ??? how can you go overboard?
Canadian_Brony in Final Fantasy. Hence the similarity
ShadowDash: Hi!
Hello PinkieCupcake
00,02Shizuka, yeah. 'BestGameEver' on the bottom bar thing
PinkieCupcake: Bonjour!
Canadian_Brony: derped again sorry
hai PinkieCupcake
PinkieSpice: We overused it.
Dark92Enigma yeah
Shizuka: is there a chance we could see the Third Harry Potter? :P
nevermind
alexxm:I'm doing fine
dat cruelty
I'll google it later
Why are pony haters such bastards?
I Am lloving this:D
So many hellos! Lol
This
Is
FUNNY
ShadowQuill: Why're people such bastards?
Canadian_Brony: Aeris effect = Deus Ex Machina used for a climax of a movie, but never used in the sequels
because the ponyfags that force ponies everywhere never stop
Meanwhile: MLP haters
/me scolds AJIsAwesome for overusing the /me comand
ShadowQuill: No, people.
11,01But Audiosurf is awesome.
People are bastards. Just the way people work.
brb
Dark92Enigma ah
and it gets annoying to see everything shitposted and derailed by fucking ponies
Meanwhile: Pony haters are not people
Canadian_Brony: hence the similarity to Final Fantasy
Buytoast: -_-
Dobby in socks
AJIsAwesome: everyone knows it works best with moderation. :U
Dark92Enigma okay
ji dont like people
freeeee

ShadowQuill: You'll find that yeah, surprisingly, they are.
Let's drop this now, guys.:S

Use the horse (no pun intended)

ShadowDash: Are you Sean?
I don't want an end that's "sticky"............:S
Oh nope, here he is.
fluttercry: that and people who say "i love the elder scrolls series, skyrim is my favorit...whats morrowind?" or "i love fallout series, why they call first one fallout 3?" or my personal fav "i havent played the original zelda on the Super Nintendo"
polish my doornob if you know what i mean. *Wink
PinkieSpice: Teh lulz
Welcome back Black Knight
PinkieSpice: YOU KNOW FOR KIDS
lol
She lives! :)
TO REHAB
11,01Bronysith: Nothing wrong with those gamers. They just make bad consumers.
05,15Bronysith Oh god them. One of my friends is like that "Oh man I love the Fallout series. I've only played 3 and NV though"
YES YES YES
The first Zelda was on nes
Bronysith I like that last one.
:)\
It's one thing if you've never been able to get your hands on an SNES, but another if you're like, "Blech, 2d games."
Back
Bronysith, i love fallout 1 and 2
Restraining order LOL
Fallout 2 was my favorite :D
I made Aperture Science in Minecraft
Zelda = Famicon/NES, Zelda 2 = SNES, yes?
Wb Ponies47 !
Lol.
Thanks Dark92Enigma
BA DUM TSS
fluttercry: i at least tried out fallout 1, pretty kewl
11,01"You only hate EA because it's cool to hate them."
Wb Ponies47
05,15Zelda 2 was also NES
05,15LTTP was SNES
Zelda 1and 2 nes
Welcome back Ponies47 :3
Same here Eulshy, FYI someone made a Little Pip mod for FO2
AND THERE WAS SO MUCH REJOICING
11,01LTTP is the earliest Zelda game I played.
the FIRST legend of zelda
Nittany_Discord: I hated EA before it was cool
gotcha
11,01Lotsa fun.
hi 47. Welcome back! *hugs*
Ponies47: Welcome back!
XD
lol
wb Ponies47

Wind Waker was my first Zelda game.
And all the modern ones
erliest one i played is zelda 1
of course Hermione would hate having no exams
Oh yeah, y'know, education
WOO!
Screw that
so pretty much the first one
11,01I gave EA too much leeway before they went bad.
/me played Ocarina of Time
Darf14, even though the story is based on F3
So were talking about zelda?
eeyup
Hagrid best pony. :D
I've never played a Zelda game.
11,01I didn't boycott them until this year.
eeeeeeeeeee
EATTTTTTTTTT
Dark92Enigma: We're trying to take it easy with the RP.
Derpy, you so random...
EAT Everything!
fluttercry: i also hate how popular skyrim has become. i mean everyone and their mother and their mothers pinkie toe knows exactly waht skyrim is
AJIsAwesome: Ok. :(
The only EA game I play is Skate
Skyward sword= best zelda game imo
lol
05,15Bronysith yet you mention Daggerfall and they're like "wut"
Bronysith: why is that a bad thing?
/me has played all the handheld and wii zeldas
:D
/me 11,01tries not to get into yet another EA rant.
05,15Skyward Sword was crap
Dark92Enigma by "easy", he actually means "Don't use it at all due to the high risk of ban"
WT
Dark92Enigma: It's okay. Just something happened earlier that we're trying to take it easy.
oh
fluttercry: like this one asshole at my school who hates games and bullied gamers and one day a girl stands up to him and he gets pissed so he goes "FUS RO DAH"
Dark92Enigma scratch that
F?!
man i forget how uplifting the first movies were
But I like Skyrim! I played Oblivion back in its time (and Nightwind Dale & Bladur's Gate before), but I like the new stuff too.
Canadian_Brony: Vinyl?
CLAP CLAP CLAP
and then after the 3rd WELL THINGS WENT depressing
fluttercry I actually liked Skyward Sword

05,15One of my friends the other day acutally said "Nobody cares about Counter-Strike. It' not popular"
SuperBrony64:
ShadowQuill: fluttershy as best pony:twilight as worst pony
05,15I could have stabbed him

Hey! Twi is awesome pony!
11,01fluttercry: CoD player?
whats wrong with beliveing in something thats more then LIKELY FAKE
fluttercry: Probally a Call of Duty noob, not to offense your friend or anything.
He's a fictional book character! He's not going to pop out of the book
xDDD
harmless, because witchcraft and magic are total crap
fluttercry he is just mad all his CoD buddies are leaving him for a far superior game.
I'm Catholic, and there are many times I just facepalm at the stuff the church does. The reaction to HP was one of those many moments
ShadowQuill: oh no not anher argumeant
05,15Yup. CoD player
http://i.imgur.com/X3EvK.png
and pinkie
oh yes, i ran around awakening sea-trolls after i read the first book
knew it
fluttercry: heres a true story. when i was in 6th grade and oblivion was fresh off shelves, i was talking with a friend about it and an asshole comes up "you play that game? wow you are a retarded fag" 6 years later when skyrim is released, same asshole "OMG SKYRIM IS SO AWESOME"
this reminds me: apperently pokemon teaches kids how to summon demons
you mean to mtell me you didnt paint pentagrams everywhere?
Meanwhile: nice pic of yourself
Does anyone think RD is best pony?
its a freaking movie,damn loony parents and other people
everyone knows magic is fake BUT FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC so does that meant LE GASP
harry potter got me into human sacrifices
It's harmless fantasy! That was just like the Salem Witch Trials.
05,15People are stupid. They start with the sequels, then complain that the others have terrible graphics
05,15WHY IS IT ALL ABOUT THE GRAFIX
these ccrazy overreligious people
fluttercry: false gamers man
moo
tSparx: which reminds me why i'm not a Catoholic anymore.......
Does ANYONE here think RD is best pony?
11,01Harry is a male witch?
flutterchu: mindless consumer zombies
Pyroid: That
This woman. Is special.
fluttercry, because games now a day are so chalengless they have to fall on graphix
nah man Twi is best
Scholastic ink.
05,15I'm the only person I know IRL that plays older games. Every time I try to show my friends older stuff, they just bitch about the age.
11,01He's breaking gender roles there.
Nittany_Discord and cross dresser!
11,01:p
fluttercry: why cant i murder everyone in the new fallouts or elder scrolls games? i can kill kids in fallout 1 and 2, so awesome
A MAN ACTED DOBBY :D
SuperBrony64: I know ur there
fluttercry: The problem is that year by year, technology inproves, CGI counts, and nobody gave a crap on Toy Story.
05,15Mega Man? People bitched about the difficulty.
I'm actually sick of HD games.
Ah-cult.
"there are 2 things that are infininte, the universe and human stupidity, and Im not sure about the universe" Albert Einstein.

fluttercry:Because most critics are stereotypes jk
Nobody loves Rainbow Dash? :(
Everyone has their own take on the ponies. I love them all!
ShadowDash: i do
11,01fluttercry: It's just how bad the mainstream gaming industry is.
lol religion
ShadowQuill: I like dashie, not fav tho...
well, this is a downer
11,01And the average gamer.
fluttercry: I put Super Metroid on my PSP and everyone at school asked why I was playing such a sucky game....
I have my favorite and least favorite, but even my least favorite pony I still love love love <3
LOL THESE NIGGAZ ARE CRAZY
fluttercry: I guess they only played Mega Man 9...
ikr Eulshy
lol
05,15soulrider95 that's one of the best games of all time
NO ONE AGREES WITH ME
11,01Easy games with 9000 tutorials that cost way too much to make.
Take a few key words here and there and you would think they are tlaking about bronies.
I'm sad now
what aree we listening to?
Super metroid was a epic game
catholic Nutjob radio?
i know that i loved crysis 1. good action, good tactics, overall awesoem gameplay and amazing graphics. games should be more like the forst crysis
Now that game is the deffinition of HARD.
ShadowQuill: I did,
Nittany_Discord: have you played Dark/Demon's Souls?
fluttercry: i really dont care about that people will like what they want I like older games, but they dont have to
fluttercry: ff7 taught me the most important rule in gaming... PERIOD
11,01"You died two times in a row? Let me tell you how to play the game again!"
Witchcraft is tax exempt
05,15Like Egoraptor says. New games are all "MEGAMAN MEGAMAN THERE IS A HUGE HOLE DON'T FALL IN IT"
Credits needs to be smaller
hell yah
DoctoDoctorWho: Thank you then! :)
11,01otakon: There are exceptions.
fluttercry not all the time
"How to concentrate"
fluttercry: contra
fluttercry I would expect good graphics from a newer game, but I prefer gameplay mechanics and whatnot. Who cares if it looks like real life when a simple task forces you to search a 50-page instruction manual.
fluttercry, can we watch egoraptor?
tax exempt, therefore were reimbursing them?
otakon ah man i LOVE Dark Souls,demon's souls was kinda linear
Most of my games have easy tutorials
I think this is Anglican Chuch radio, but idk
fluttercry: thats why skyrim sucks SO GODDAMN MUCH HANDHOLDING
ohai otakon
Guys I'm sad now
hahahahahahahaha *gasp* uuuuuuhhhhhhhhh whatthefuck
11,01Of course, I hated TF2 originally when it didn't have a practice mode years back.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: um... Demon's is NOT linear, Dark is
fluttercry: That counts for Mario too in some overworld levels.
Spademagnes[R]: Why?
harry makes jesus cry
what the fuck?
Spademagnes[R]: Bout what? :(
11,01Tutorials are OK.
Nittany_Discord: I'm watching a let's play of Star Control II - Ur-Quan Masters, and it's really in depth. I wish games were that good today.
who is that megabich talking=
11,01Excessive tutorials are not.
otakon how?
Meanwhile: Depressing, right?
This has opened my eyes.
Keledo is coming out next week and I cant go to a gamestop and get it
Save me Jesus.
Forgive me for reading books.
05,15....this chick for real?
DJ Jesus died for your spins.
Nittany_Discord TF2 was dieing before F2P and tutorials
11,01And I hate how game manuals have all but disappeared.
Spademagnes[R]: Keldeo?:O
Omg, the internet.
Pornography?
same here Spademagnes
What?
Hide yo kids.
How is that relevant?!
PORNOGRAPHY
Lol pornography
Porn at school? Where are these sites?
Star Control came with a starmap.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: you beat the first level then you can access the other levels in whatever order you want in Demon's Souls. In Dark Souls you more or less have to beat everything in the same order.
11,01I used to have fun reading about the game and what to expect.
....Any one is paying more attention on the credits rather than the lady's voice?
I wanted that freaking pokemon...
Nittany_Discord: and then there are games in which tutorials are essential to knwo what the hell is happening. like eve online
Search Harry Potter receive porn. Sounds legit?
THESE PEOPLE ARE FKING IDIIOT
Bwahahahahahahaha, oh wait your serious?

11,01Canadian_Brony: Yep.
this woman is nuts
Funny, I remember that the onion did a report on Harry Potter that it teaches kids about witchcraft and people took is seriously..... man people are Idiots
otakon..really?

Yeah. Never make heroes out of Warlocks. Go for Paladins instead.

My kitten is confirmed for brony I guess. O.o
11,01I think it comes from RPers where alicorns are frowned upon for being god-modded characters.
where Luna gets chased by a butterfly and it scares a crap out of her
05,15Nittany_Discord nothing wrong with Allicorn OCs the problem is the ones that make theirs the most powerful ponies in the world
Nittany_Discord: She's overrated.
:'(
08,01you can see so much tonight
08,01i went out with my binos
why does the most horrifying things always eat the victims?

What is this
11,01Those were fun days.
bye Ponies47
13Dark_Horst: it is, but the challenge of the game stops being "you against the paddle" and more "you against the field"
Nittany_Discord: see you soon aniki
tyunnmjturmfuymtm nt
Wait, so it was back from when you were an itty bitty twinkie Shizu?
My arm spasmed
This is what it would be like if you where droppin' acid and playing pong at the same time
http://cheezburger.com/4714265856
This game is highly recomended for Hippies, and for those who have artificial high.
super epic pony
*pong sorry

/me falls over from diabeetus because he remembered that filly Shizu pic ;_;
11,01If you still can't find anyone after I take a shower, I might join.
Shizuka: count me in
I need to see the filly Shizu pic!
is adventure time any good?
05,15I've never played MvM so I have no idea how it works or if I have to download anything
Need filly shizu nao!
13tf2 fluttercry
Should've updated automatically fluttercry.
This is what's Pong was played back in the 60s.
fluttercry do you want me to send you a link to the wiki page? That will explain everythign you need to know about Mann vs Machine
Dawwww

Shizuka: nice your OC <3

THANKS, Shizuka!
05,15I mean if all I have to do is open TF2, then I'm down for a game
>.>
AWWWWWWW!! MY EYES

http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h217/Hotaru_Malus/hnnnng.jpg
13so kirz, meanwhile, me, buytoast, fluttercry
I've heard it before
13sixth?
Shizuka, you looked sooooo CUTE! I want to hug that thing!
Shizuka:
Shizuka: me
otakon: dafuq? http://cheezburger.com/6520121856
me me
Shizuka: I would but we're eating dinner soon
\
Shizuka: me please~
kirzstryfe: dont be bashful for something you made
13shamrocs and dark horst duel to the death!
who's shizu
If my TF2 worked I would totally play.
/me shoots Dark_Horst
i win
flutterchu: really? fucking really?
flutterchu Shizuka
Shizuka: i can wait, busy mining in eve anyway^^
Shamroc: stop startin
this music somehow reminds me of "hunt for the red october" for some odd reason
hush
You want me to flip a coin for Shamroc and Dark_Horst?
Meanwhile: yes
flutterchu: *facehoof*
Meanwhile: too late
Meanwhile: random number generator
if i wasn't on my laptop i'd gladly play with you, Shizuka :)
13i think i still have like 8 lives at this point but you'll see me start losing them one after another
Shizuka: i'll wait until shamroc gets bored
m
13without the AI doing much
otakon: what do you think of kingdom hearts 1 and 2?
has anyone ever seen that movie?
I would like to, but there's no point reserving a spot for me cuz TF2 will probably crash.
05,15dat never ending preparing
Bronysith: great games, get them
im not sure if any of really feel sad for thinking-ooooohhhhhhh the streamer
otakon: i already beat 2 my brother
fluttercry: Tell me about it.
Bronysith: simple but likable characters and stories
13each level the music pitches up and the influence of the field gets more intense
i think i've seen some of the hunt for red september
otakon: spent 3 dollars on it at a flea market...30 hours of gameplay from story alone
13you can see it in the particles that whip around
Bronysith: you RUINED IT FOR YOURSELF THEN! goddammit you NEVER play the sequel
before the original
otakon: what? i did play the original
who else is starting to get a seizure?
I'm Batman
otakon: i just recently played the 2nd one
Bronysith: yes, good game not as polished as 2 but still good
good thing i didnt download this
08,01i don't know why, but suddenly, i just feel like breaking down in tears
i'll join if there is place
08,01i think the whole... everything about this weekend has just hit me
13it's funny how you need the sound to play this well
THIS VIDEO IS CONFUSING
13there i went
Bunny_Striker: more along the lines of "creeped the buck out" but you know thats just me
Shizuka: Oh, so the ball goes with the "current" in the background? Like the way it flows?
13yep
I have no idea whats going on but I find it entertaining....
13thus the sucking in and jet mechanics
otakon: i played and beat kingdom hearts 1 so oh so many years ago i beat it. havent played it for a while so when i played 2 it was a bit hazy lol
Shizuka: Help, I'm dying
Okay I was searching around for this image to show during the Sponebob episode, but didn't find it in time: http://denver.poniponi.com/media/large/1415__safe_comic_princess-luna_princess-celestia_filly_moon_butterfly_flower_artist-flausch-katzerl.png
08,01Meanwhile: aye, but stress too
13so i think we have a team
Shizuka: Ah. This game makes sense to me now.
13give me a sec to switch sources
08,01and emptiness; i feel like there's this huge hole now that BUCK is over
I wanted to play Plasma Pong, I looked at the site and it's got down for copyrights from Atari? What the heck?!
08,01guess it's time to start plannign for the next one...
JESmith that's adorable

Shamroc did you try to enter? I've seen this before

Nittany_Discord: The pinkie shepard?
kirzstryfe: I was about to join but someone took it at the last second x3
my friend thinks Medics and Pyros are a waste in TF2. I'm currently showing him this.
Kirzstryfe how where they stealing spots I thought it was first come first serve?
11,01Spademagnes[R]: Yep/
nope
OH THE STREAM CANNA HANDLE IT!
im soo laggy when i watch this
Shizuka said the team, apparently nobody was paying attention
^
Nittany_Discord: People need to learn to grow a pari and stop bitching about ponies
11,01Even if I didn't like ponies, I would tell those people to get over it.
Kirzstryfe how did they steal the spots?
Medics and Pryros are useless?! Time to prove your friend wrong
*pair
Fire fire fire..................
Darf14 I'm showing him this.
so much fire
08,01okay, everypony
08,01i need your advice
08,01i want, nay, need, a chrysalis plushie
08,01but it needs to be absolutely perfect
08,01and i'm willing to spend a *lot* of money on it
man it takes forever to get into a match
gimme a couple minutes
This plushie was going to be perfect...
This plushie is going to be perfect, the kind of plush of which he dreamed since he was small.
08,01can someone recommend me a plush maker to commission it, or link me a currently running ebay auction
i already have one ^^
11,01Too bad that one plushie maker had to stop making plushies.
but ill look
$2000 was the first I found
11,01Due to badly-written trademark laws.
O__________O
11,01Wish I could sell something for $2000.
every plushie will gather around, itll look lovely on the shelf, what they dont know is that i got it for freeeee
You could look up that one guy who made the RD plushie that went 4 nearly 3k
08,01Major: hmm... it's nice, but not... perfect
11,01Once I get money, I'm replacing a fragile Fausticorn I had that shattered.
he should heal up
.....NV
Darf14: she's fine
Darf14: Shizu is playing the Pyro and she's a GOOD pyro
Darf14: if a little axe happy
huh didnt know Shizu is playing
lol poor Caramel
Darf14: she's streaming
o.o
11,01Steam is screwy today for some reason.
How'd that person get up thar. o.o
Nittany_Discord: it's working fine for me
OH I was wondering
oh man i wish i can link this video but that would be braking the rules
has anyone here heard of Dins' Curse?
bc it looks good
Nittany_Discord, has it been causing other programs to run slowly?
for those who can't/won't get Diablo 3
11,01Oh, it's updating.
11,01No, it wasn't starting.
Better than Torchlight 2, otakon?
11,01And right when I killed it, it started updating.
CriticKitten: probably not, but it's a indie game and it's only 9 bucks
My mom had trouble with Open Office earlier. It also had problems starting.
nope never heard of Dins Curse
11,01I won't buy Diablo 3 because of the DRM.
I for one welcome our robot overlords
AJIsAwesome: aw I was about to post that :D
Nittany_Discord: well Din's Curse is all of that hack n slash goodness with NO DRM, it's a indie title and there is dynamic quests. Your town can get attacked while you're down in a dungeon and if you don't defend it you have to start over ...but with your gear/levels intact.
08,01AJIsAwesome: i quite like the top of that one, but not the bottom
DoctoDoctorWho: that's sold :P
11,01Wasn't White Dove shut down?
1 tank? No problem
11,01Though she may be back up.
13wasn't shut down, just had to stop having prices on dA
Major: one could always request another,
08,01Pikachu: no offense to the person who made that, but it looks like someone has just dribbled mint choc chip icecream... down... nightmare... moon... i'll be in my bunk
sold, sold, not for sale, sold . . .
I have to admit, the robot Spy is good
my com freezed
Major not for sale tho
Canadian_Brony: just using it for an example :P
oh
well nice my stream froze up

08,01i dunno what i'm looking or really; all i know is that i'll be able to tell when i see it
otakon: I thought I was the only one seeing that
11,01Hi Caramel
Major: it's just that the stream can't handle Shizu'a AWESOMENESS!
howdy
hi there Caramel how are you today?
hi Caramel
hiya Caramel welcome back man...why don't you ever have colors anymore?
tired :P
hi Caramel
otakon: I've explained that like....4 times now
Hallo Caramel
Hello, Caramel.
otakon: She is so awesome that Swag, Class, and Epicness dont have shit on her! :D
Caramel: eat some coffee ice cream
Caramel: you have?
^
my computer died
so I don't have mIRC any more
curse those giant demoman
Caramel: oh...crap yeah...sorry my memory is shot
NO!
BBL, dinner
Darf14, Ikr?
13looks like the fail stream was mostly from the net graph
but hey, last day of work was today
Shizuka: can you turn it off?
so now I just have to pack for friday
could be worse, it could be giant scouts
Caramel: yay! then you...pack for Friday?
Darf14: I hate giant scouts, too fast
Darf14, you into mvm anbd want to halp me design my mvm level?
Shizuka: quick tip, if a bot is about to jump in, airblast it, no matter what it is it can be airblasted :P
Major: she IS Pyro personified I think she knows that tactic
im not much of a level designer but I can help as much as I can
yeah, I leave for university again on Friday
Caramel: well good luck man, that means we won't see you that often around here doesn't it?
nah
otakon: always helps to make sure :$
if anything, you'll see me more
Caramel: yay!
since I wont be working 7:00-6:00
Haha,that's how I do college too, Caramel
I think I'll stop saying yay
it's unbecoming for a 28 year old hobbit to say yay
Darf14, I'd like ot get a bucnh of ppl on my tekkit server to build the level, then I'll just model everything up and I wont hacve to create soo much :D
Caramel: how much are you being paid for it? :P
So its an open invite, anyone who wants to help design my MvM level, pm me
enough to pay for college, not nearly enough to justify the work I put in
where da robot women at
ok :)
I cna host it as regualr minecraft too if tekkit is unknown to anyone intereted
DuskStarShummer: im playing minecraft right now XD
man, those demos are evil
i just had 2 screamer's in happy wheels im scared im shaking...............feed me :'(
poor shizu didn't stand a chance
Oh and thanks for the Makkon suggestion last night. I've been perusing her/his channel, and some of those songs are just incredible
And the rest are still really awesome
flutterchu: shhh its okay, I feel your pain :(
....oh wait , this stage has a Heavy + Medic Combo >_<
rapid fire demos are the reason I hate playing pyro :P
mass soldies scare me to death
Dat Caramel
Major: this is....2 screamers not 1
dat phony
O.o
flutterchu: I delt with 2 screamers :P
brb and hiya SuperPhony64 :P
Sadly Grey didnt make a Robot Engineer
SuperBrony64: why you have no colors? :P
Hai otakon :3c
Caramel: doesn't everyone get access to Blast Resistance?
yeah
Major: yes but this is on happy wheels can you imagine
or is that only the Heavy
Major: Cause I nekkid :3
okay so just stock up on some
flutterchu: What's happy wheels?
SuperBrony64: O///////O
brb gotta get the dog to stop chewing on my door
but honestly, I hate investing in resistances
just because it's situational
whereas straight up damage or health on kill applies to all
AJIsAwesome: a flash game http://www.totaljerkface.com/happy_wheels.php
AJISAWSOME: ITS A GAME
I reached up to Level 13 in Plasma Pong.

PaladinDrakkenwolf: eeyup, they're easy but the medics are a pain.
Oh guys guess whut? My math teacher is a brony <3

Meanwhile: well you should stop posting rhetorical nonsense
And a awesome one at that :)
otakon: Demoman is the answer for the medic problem
thats awesome Mishia

PaladinDrakkenwolf: bah, Heavy with Penetration and fire rate boost

0,5ah yo yony ah yu yoke n yoke
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Ikr? i spend an extra 2 min. after class to talk to him. Tomarow im inviting him to my Minecraft serv. If you wanna see him, he says he plays Tf2 on poniponiponi serv. at night on weekends
Meanwhile: your point? You've also called me a White Knight and other such derogatories but it doesn't bother me. :)
:< but i know not his Gamename
otakon: Is he being mean? :(
he's Meanwhile
otakon: That /was/ my point, way to miss it. Still, that is true and I guess you are who you are, more power to you.
it's IN his nick
00,02Shizuka, looks like he's sleeping
And Mishia, the clue is in the...yeah that, thanks.
Which is which?
if he wasn't Mean, his moustache would shrivel up and fall off
Mishia i would like to but my PC is garbage so i probbly wouldnt be able to run ANY game on it lol :$ thanks for the offer though
SuperBrony64 or SuperBrony64_
Exactly.
Meanwhile: I know. I was hoping there would me no rudeness...
Meanwhile: Oh I didn't miss it, I just ignored it :)
Sketch_Toku_Brony: its k:)
otakon: Close enough.
Well then Mishia I shall try not to hock phlegm at you.
XD
Shizuka: okay seriously can you teach me or something how to effectively play Pyro? I tried and I do NOT get the same results as you on even a small run.
otakon: stay mobile learn the flamethrowers arc and practice the airblast.
No no i just dint want any hostilities because i have been playing on my fav. server where one guy will not stop killing me and only me. Apperently, my name he dosent like
Meanwhile: well thanks :)
13otakon: don't die
And if all else fails, pyro car.
Mishia: don't worry about Meanwhile we go through something like this about once a week.
otakon: She could teach you, but she'd have to charge
Shizuka: thanks :P
lol
otakon: *hugs*
lol
oh yeah i got a question i had a whole summer without ponies and the olympics were on did you guys stream the olympics
Shizuka: * hugs as well*
Shizuka: thanks for the stream
Hugs for all!
RWARRRGH
flutterchu: the opening ceremony got streamed in hopes of seeing the Doctor.. it was not to be.
Mishia: not for Caramel he has issues with hugs.

don't care so much anymore
*removes hands from caramel anyway*
hmmm not sure if improvement or not
caramel is best transpony
but anyway, going afk to play some ME3
bbl
Shizuka: Upgrade your burn time and damage.
yay!

Wat,
We are VICTOURIOUS
im done with tf2 for today, one spot will be open :>
:D
victory hug http://derpibooru.org/75250?scope=scpe3125a2fdbbd5d9f1698be5f970a7a7aef2641afa
13i find burn time/damage isn't worth it
13if the bot is alive long enough to be taking the damage/time, we're losing
00,02^
Shizuka: unless youre good with the Axestinguisher
hate drawing feet
13better that they don't get past me at all
hands too
00,02i came to the same conclusion when i tried pyro
13i'm good with ax combos normally, but this is too many people at once to try it
13W+M1 is more effective
05,15I'm loving this
W+m1?
yeah its best saved for the harder modes imo
0,14drawing Lyra art? XD
otakon: Run forward and shoot.
This game has always been and always will be about spam
so...damage all the way?
oh
otakon: It's known as the pyrocar.
oh
It has a song.
so that is the pyro car
0,14...this song is going well with Gangnam Style
lol
:P
well yay first kick of the night...goddammit
trying an actual human figure, something I've never really done before
0,14ah
Gangnam style is like Guiles theme... it goes with everything
0,14indeed
I wonder if the console versions of TF2 will get MvM
and hai Saxy :3
well im off, bye everypony :)
lol
trying to get the positioning and perspective right on the legs/feet right now
not sure why I was kicked for that

well that was fun
not that
anyway bbl
will community be streamed today?
13can't find the thing where the kid is pyroing with a steering wheel
pony up boys
superretroworld: ask Caramel
superretroworld, I hope not
Caramel: are you going to stream some Community later?
Caramel is a male...and I wont tolerate trolling to imply otherwise -_-
Shizuka: i am that one pyro who hops into battle and sets everyone aflame
...I wasn't trolling
otakon: I can if you want
I just think she's cute as a transpony
Caramel: well superretroworld was wondering
god

11,01Can't do it? Don't approximate my name. :)
You know, I read some griping about the SYMPATHY system, but imo, it's working pretty nicely.
my tongue feels weird
it may have something to do with the fact I've been sucking on a toothpick for half an hour
Canadian_Brony: Rub it with sandpaper.
I suppose it could use some work, but there's always room for it.
Flootahshy done that before. It wasn't pleasant
Canadian_Brony: What? Why?
Truth or Dare
I'm 15, k?
that probably doesn't help
was it something I said?
O.o
05,15I'm leaving after this game so if annyone wants my spot they can have it

13i am crouch jumping
Three answers, that answer my question regarding the previous one.
crouch jumping is only half of it
00,03You know what this game needs? Dragonforce
13probably can't just det jump up to him, i barely make it up to the platform
05,15Well that was fun
00,03Dragonforce and MOABS
0,14...

11,01Scoot-Scootaloo: I never said I hated consoles.
Hello
hi Cranberry_Scotch
me too i like consoles
11,01I dislike where the Xbox is and the PS3 is going.
^
Consoles are way better than PC :)
What do you mean?
SuperBrony64_: You're wrong.
ohai Meanwhile
SuperBrony64_: In fact you support nintendo so you're extra wrong.
SuperBrony64_: In fact you're you so you're extra extra wrong.
Nintendo isn't bad
I predict a heated debate about consoles vs. PC?
You are the wrongest wrong who was ever wrong about not being right.
ah there we go
steam must hate me
00,03We need to get some console games all up in here, like what SB already does :D
Wait what
SuperBrony64_: stop
11,01I probably won't buy a next gen console even if I have the money because of how badly console manufacturers are locking them down.
Hammer time
Something about supporting Nintendo being wrong?
13they are so silly
Meanwhile takes one to know one.
11,01I hope the rumors turn out to be false.
I liek silleh :3
Canadian_Brony: By that logic it takes a pedofile to know onel
only portal and gears im into in the new era
Canadian_Brony: But somehow I doubt they look for that during jury duty.
You'll have to enter quarters into the new machines.
Meanwhile you don't understand the concept behind the saying, do you?
Meanwhile wait, yes you do.
troll
I do, which is why I understand it's silly.
Deal with it, eh.
Meanwhile, take a look at that sentence full of wrongs...unless those negatives are all in order, which they very might well be.

0,14maybe
If Nintendo were so bad, why did Sony and Microsoft try to copy the concept of the Wii?
JRP: How? O.o
I just find it odd how all 3 3Gen8 consoles seems to have some varient of the "personal touchscreen" motif.
Kandarihu I know nothing about what Microsoft and Sony are doing.
SuperBrony64_: 9999999999999999999999999999997999999

00,10oh hi kirz
0,14XD
mitamaking hell yeah
<3
/me dances around trowing fake snow everywhere
that was a fast wave
Congrats, otakon, your love of getting kicked has become a minor meme.
MINOR?!?!?
I salute your internet fame.
CCCP: i wish for more ponies
00,03If only he were here...
CCCP:its hotter than shit here
So can you beat this mode?
superretroworld you shal get, A G3 Scootaloo
otakon's logged in but he's ignoring us.
Reikim I've been here for 5 months and I would've thought his obbsession with kicks should've been in the Annual Tom Awards!
0,14thanks Shizuka <3
mitamaking yes. The bots aren't endless
what am i watching 0.o
Shipping him should've been, but nah, that one got axed.
CCCP:not even december yet
CCCP: NOOOOOOOOOOOO 6_9
Reikim forgot about that one
Admin/Mod most kicks award goes too........
Canadian_Brony, it was considered, but we wanted to stay away from memes centered around individual people
Jingle Bells
!Jingle Bells!
He would've won, though.
13anypony recognize the tune?
0,14...sounds kinda familiar
I don't think otakon could beat Shoo be doo
kirz|art I still get a chuckle from it being considered.
00,10is it the sound of one hand claping?
00,03Through the Fire and Flames?
0,14almost wanna say something from Alice in Chains
Sounds like something from DOOM.
Sumica . . . yes.
13that was MAP25 doom 2
sonicandmario85 ITS HERE NOW!
styx?
I KNEW IT!
ded
The problem with trying to avoid memes centred on individuals is that this is an IRC and therefore the majority of memes will be based on individuals. Meanwhile's moustache, otakon's kicks/ships/potato/hobbitness, Shizu's noodle, and so on, and so forth.
CCCP:no.....its not
ah
ok
00,03...Shizu's noodle?
otakon's potato?
Scoot-Scootaloo ban noodle
MONKEYS
13scoots keep up
00,03Ohhhhhhh
mitamaking can't help you there
My moustache is a meme?
what is the ota kick count total - is anyone keeping track?
Meanwhile O_______O
otakon's connection is legendarily bad. We like to say it runs through a potato.
00,03Sorry, I thought it was a communism term :S
yeah
sonicandmario85 Forget Months!
their overrated
so who's ready for GW2, and have any idea which server would be good to start on?
forget time too
But really, otakon's got the record for most memes per individual.
CCCP: weeks though are awesome
dammit . . .
1 day, 20 hours, 11 minutes :$
I don't intend on buying it...
Slenderman: till what?
hi Slenderman

0,14Ouch
Sorry, I was watching a clip of the turtleman before he actually went on TV. I almost cried because I was laughing so hard.

Canadian_Brony: I would have gone with Zoidberg, but good job

A girl asks him out - a girl he liked
And he turns her down to play Skyrim.
Valentines day just makes me more lonely :'(
CCCP, Capitalism is tolerable when the government tolerates it.
Canadian_Brony: *gasp*
ah, that one
yeah...
epic music for the final wave
Slenderman:UNLEASH SCP-173 UPON THE WORLD AND LET EVERY ONE LOOK AT HIS BEAUTIFIL FACE THEN HE WILL KILL EVERYONE GJIOFHGIFGHIUFDIU

11,01Dovah: Sadly.
Dovah: *you're Sorry, the grammar nazi urge is itching me...
This seems pretty easy
Oh god pun unintended
Democracy is said to be the worst form of government
Hey, at least you're being put there.
Dayum
I'm currently stuck in friendzone because I'm a bloody coward.
which is funny, because everyone she's dated since we've met has thought that I was sleeping with her while they were dating >.<
Kawaii_icybeauti, indeed. NoKo is pretty much an extreme example, but communism has ALWAYS resulted in dictatorships to one degree or another.
11,01Malk: Except for the the rest.
Malk: But look at wat communism does to people.
Except all the others that have tried
why doesn't anybody ever say "pun intended"?
You guys are MURDERING that tank ._.
...
I really gotta restart my computer.
Cypresswolf: I got a laptop for my birthday so no
/me laughs
Yep Nittany_Discord you got the quote
Because the pun isn't intended
That's actually really funny.
*sigh*
she's had 3 serious relationships in the time I've known her, all 3 thought it
CCCP:look at SCP-173S face...
Im going to try and join the server
That spy was a robot all along
/me plants mistletoe everywhere
SuperBrony64: ?
Doesn't seem like a very secure friendzone, then. That or it's just males being customarily stupid, which...is normal.
do i hear rob zombie? yes i do hear rob zombie
*razors
My birthday is 4th July
so everypony MUST kiss
Canadian_Brony: How Canadian
/me looks up
o.O
not sure, we get a long very well and have what some of our other friends call "a wavelength"
I think you're overlooking the real question here Reikim.
everypony must kiss!
/me looks up and sees mistle toe
maybe its just me - I have 5 others in my family and my parents get us at least 2 gifts each year, plus a few things from my Aunt & Uncle from Austin, & my Grandma - end up getting over a dozen things every year - more junk for the pile
Hm?
>.>
Which is of course
oh god
<.<
WERE you sleeping with her kirz?
RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
we just get jokes in the same way and think along the same lines
-_^
nope :P
*flees from the house*
HAX
Did the game just restart?
Just checking~
wha song is this
Beam me up, Scotty!

You forgot the followup question.

/me leans in close
hadokun
Does it get harder?
Are you sure?
lol
DAT PYRO
11,01Fluttercry turned a girl down for Skyrim? I guess it depends on if he liked her or not.
He liked her.
why aren't you seeing that twisted fantasy world?
U see Meanwhile and Shizuka, who else is in there
Apparently he'd liked her for a while.
*I
Launch date comes around, she asks him out, nope, Skyrim.
Just buy me a steak dinner and I'm happy :)
mitamaking depends on your game mode. Waves become increasingly difficult and maps each have set waves.

00,10I am geting a full server message
00,02Shizuka, would have turned itself back on
11,01Oh his TF2 server otakon.
13i think they fixed the player size
Sumica yeah, I'm not spectating
CCCP otakon and his mcnuggies are also not acceptable presents
...
11,01Not here. There's no sane reason why we would kick idle people in chat.
I'm watching the stream, though
Nittany_Discord: besides them just clogging up the chat when they NEVER EVER EVER TALK?
Crawket!
kick all the idle!
you go Shizuka, thats some nice airblasting
IshInsertRandomNick it was.. a picture i spent 2 months on it :'(
11,01Not really a reason to kick them.

Scoot-Scootaloo: hell spectating ir probably better quality then the actual stream atm
o.O
otakon spectating in-game?
00,03shaddup :|

Canadian_Brony: yes
:D
00,03I don't have steam :(

My OC has a cookie cutie mark, because I like cookies
My oc has no cutie mark
13blaaank flaaank

Love this anime
tSparx: thats not a good thing?
soooooooooo MUCH! :)
Dovah : Japanese voice actors >>>>> English ones
tSparx: seems odd as you spend more time reading what is said and not looking at the actual show
That's compounded by the fact that I'm not quite as intimate with Japanese ;D
Dovah: It works out, trust me.
00,10as dubed that is
Hellsing VA > everything
00,10also this is a complex show so english helps

wait shizuka is in twin cities?! why didnt i know that when i went there 4 months ago?!
You neverf asked.
13because shizu does not meet people from the internet
tSparx: HOW DARE YOU OFFEND ME WITH THAT LAST ONE!!
tSparx: :S
AdamTheDuck: :5
silly shizu i'm not from the internet i'm from your neaboring state
Which was supposed to be a backwards S, but looks like eyes wearing pumps
tSparx: good
HOLY SHIT
/me is sitting in his chair, whispering, softly, "Winter wrap up winter wrap up"
ah cool GitS
/me is sleeping on a couch because my brother is being a dick
moo
Shizuka you should, alot of the people here are quite nice IRL
13that's what they said last time
judging from the what, 6 i met
great sample size :P
Chrysalis, one can't be too careful these days.
There was a 'last time'? :/
thats what conventions are for
13it is hard to get that trust back
Incredible math!
well im off 2 bed,night everypony ;)
13i am not sure if i ever will
OK. These lyrics are... silly.
/me hugs Shizuka
Nigh Sketch_Toku_Brony !
Goodnight Sketch_Toku_Brony
/me glomps Shizuka
Shizuka: what happend?
WHat?!
my brother is a dick, making me sleep on the couch
/me sits back, prepared to listen to a life lesson from Shizuka :P
13it's not something i enjoy reliving..
Man, this is so funny
Oh my god...
*pushes AdamTheDuck off his chair*
This...
I know it.. but where?
SKillet!
/me throws tSparx through a window
/me noms on Bunny_Striker, tastes like a rainbow
SKILLET!!
I'm back mates ^_^
angry!T-Sparx = fantasticness
Welcome back TheRandomkid321
Shizuka: If i was completly uncareing id still ask but im not, so i wont
Bunny_Striker: Defenestration of all me's are not allowed.
00,10perhaps I should finish up some more Dickshep
They finally have AJ emotes. >_><_<
/me hugs Shizuka, 'cause internet hug is best type of hug.
I should be doing my assignment...
00,10be right back
if one has bad experiences meeting people on the internet let it be a life lesson to always carry a S&W .500
TheRandomkid321: Key word is 'should'. Let future TheRandomkid321 deal with the problem and let present TheRandomkid321 have fun :D
Dovah: Couldn't just not meet people from the internet IRL?
tSparx: then you wouldnt be able to go to cons
Anyway, future TheRandomkid321 will be blaming past TheRandomkid321 so it won't affect present TheRandomkid321.
AdamTheDuck *ellipsis*
Well I mean without an army of fellow, good bronies to protect me
AdamTheDuck: Stop!
tSparx: Ok :D
AdamTheDuck: When T-Sparx tried this
AdamTheDuck: She almost destroyed herself
AdamTheDuck: Time travel isn't somethign anypony should try
good morning everypony
So I told my mate I was a brony. He said I'm going to grow up to be a rapist. He was joking of course... I hope... and also once his gay cousin tried to rape him...

Chrysalis... Oh *shoop* now I have Slendy AND The Cops to worry about? SH!T D!CK F^CK C0CK!

Hello everypony.
hello Polydunami
Konichiwa Polydunami-san
Oh my, is it afternoon where you are tSparx? :O
No it's like 2:30am, haha.
Dat 2nd option :D
"Oh.
"
Oh. Then I don't think it's quite correct to wish someone... "Kon'nichiwa" at that time :P
It is 12:30 Am. Do you know where your children are?
I have no children.
Yet.
I don't know what I felt like saying that.
*why not what
...... I see that it's kinda dead here too....
Polydunami: I was under the impression that Konnichiwa could be used at any time of day. I recognize there might be a better word, but.
i don't have any children. and if i had, they'd be at school oder kindergarten, since it's 9.40 am over here
Confound these time zomes.
I was told that it was to mean "good afternoon" or something
*zones
Maybe it was "good day"
Polydunami: I'm pretty sure it means "Good day," and is a general hello. There are several more though, haha, and the most general would be moshi-moshi
Oh.
somepony_else: Bist du Deustcher?
jepp
Deutscher*
Konichiwa: "Good Afternoon"
Saberyshy Gladly corrected
Moshimoshi: "A way of saying hello, but only through telephones or cells.
Good morning Bronystate! :) Dickshep Sumica in action?
Not just calls! I've been told moshimoshi on chats too.
Hey MadSurge
Yeah, that's Sumica alright
:3

Where did Fluttershy come from?
tSparx: that's sumi's ping

tSparx: I was lead to believe it was through any electronic media, but I was just being safe by saying it waqs through phones.
One of them, tSparx :P

Sabershy: Gotcha ;)

Wuut should have seen that coming.

MASF123|The_Jinx: Addicting and leaves you in a high mode (sugar rush) or in a depressed state (sugar crash), has to be bought, can be detrimental to your health, even leading up to death
MASF123|The_Jinx: used to find ot if you're just playing sick. and hypochondrics
BroHoof: Wnjoy your nightmares when it's done O_O
Don't see much difference. >_>
