Snakes use their fork-like tongue to "smell" the air, and special sensors under its eyes to track prey thermally.

O__________O
Saturn: hows this? http://fav.me/d4ynfr0
11,01Wish I could sell something for $2000.

Oh and thanks for the Makkon suggestion last night. I've been perusing her/his channel, and some of those songs are just incredible
And the rest are still really awesome
dat phony
O.o
yeah
but honestly, I hate investing in resistances
just because it's situational
whereas straight up damage or health on kill applies to all
Fact: Piss can make a tank take more damage
