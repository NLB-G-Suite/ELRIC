DocSane: turns out your name isn't your real name
O_o
Dr.horrible is best pony
11,01Silverscreen!
ShiningArmor: then you cant really make a good educated opinion on what the best anime is
He should Play Apple.Mov or Magic.Mov
I found Barq's to be the absolute best :3
dat feeling when u know that the AVGN movie is almost done
So how has everypony been since I have been gone? :)
2Yummm <3

Silverscreen: did you know he did a quick bit about mlp?

ShiningArmor: Go watch Gurren Lagann. It's free on Youtube. Then make judgments.

07lol
mibimibmibmibmib
If there's one way to lose me on an anime, it's overpeppy high-pitched openings filled with dancing.
GarrettBrony: But we streamed the ENTIRE SERIES on Monday.
Paladin_Drakkenwolf: Of course i will ;)
00,10we just had FLCL like monday
/me Eye twitches
0,5=====
Reminds me too much of Haruhi
OH
Reikim: its an exceptionally random slapstick comedy type of anime, its hilarious in short
Sumica: stream LAIN!
00,10dont have it
Sumica even episode 4? that was a trip
what is this?

......Again... WHAT THE...FUCK!?

BYEEEEEEEE
Reikim: yeah...i never really get away with watching something else when i'm here
ohai Arti!
a hai Celestia
Whats wrong with his face?
Silverscreen: What happens when you give one of the best anime studios a truckload of crack.
lol
^v^
11,01This sounds like the VA for Ed in FMA:Brotherhood.
Dem coughdrops
Well I have to go for real soon
Silverscreen: It's a rather famous mindfuck anime, filled to the brim with strange and confusing imagery, where effectively everything is a massive metaphor for puberty/growing up.
1,11...ah.
^^
Reikim: this is what happens when you do that
Did you enjoy the honeymoon?
I knew it sounded like edward...
Reikim: >Gainax
guys BRB im taking a bath
00,10....... I think you are right Nittany_Discord
>one of the best anime studios
>what
those eyes
RAWRity: How is anything that goes on in that a metaphor for puberty?
lol
Nittany_Discord: vic minogana or something
CupcakeWarrior: It's complicated.
dat eye!!!
Spectrum_Rush: Got it.
CupcakeWarrior: that entire 3rd episode is a metaphor for the menstrual cycle, actually.
Dat strangle
RAWRity: How?
lol
lol wtf :D
RAWRity: what was that, the cat one?
CupcakeWarrior: just...watch that ep with that in mind.
:O
YOu'll see it.
owlicious: yes
WHy do I picture naruto though...
lol
GET MAD
Um. Okay then.
RAWRity: Ive seen that ep three times, I dont see any sort of symbolism
Dat headbang
:(
wow
Oh it was so awesome :3 today is my last day
YEAAAAHHHH RAGE
:D wtf
?
CupcakeWarrior: It's there if you know what to look for.
This is awesome!
i like trains
head butt everything!
i love jpan
Triple kill!
:3
O_O woooh
:S
i love this show
mips! Stop sucking so hard!
:3
Why do people like this so much? Its just random things that make no sense
CupcakeWarrior: exactly
random things are best things
I am going to design a website that'll hold all our wedding and honeymoon pics.
because what fun is there in making sense?
CupcakeWarrior: it makes sense if you pay attention a bit, and its basically like pinkie pie, its hilarious even if it is random as crap
That way I'll have nice online albums as well as real ones
awesome! :D
Lots of people make the mistake of thinking FLCL is "random" or weird for the sake of weird. Not true. It's more "Hey, we've got a rather simple coming of age story to tell. Let's doing it in the most hyperactive, strange way we can, and let the animators run wild!"
If everything would make sense, Pinkie Pie wouldnt make sense
agred MahBoi777

And then I was a demon
LOL at this http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?blog=5139;sa=topic;id=243

Huzzah!
/me leans against LadyCanary and offers her a brownie
streams over?
:(
huzzah
KaitoThePony: I have a very different theory. Derpy and Ditzy are identical twins. Ditzy is married, happily, and makes soda pop for a living. Thus the bubbles. She has no sense of direction, though... Derpy OTOH has a perfect sense of direction which is why she works as a mailmare. Those ain't bubbles on her flank. those are map co-ordinates.
mario_pony oh that movie's out already?

I missed Articuno
I'm rather worried about this guy.
Hello FlareChaser|Octavia
awwwwwww
MahBoi777: hi....
Twi_Fi: herro
I have no idea what even happened
03can you help
Door is now plot-relevant. Expect it to open by the end of the episode.
yup
Noted
Yeah but fireflies are a poor light source.
>java
sorry, nope
hmmmmm
03well
03I dont'care about syntaxes
03it's the logic I need help with
03:/
03recursion is killing me
03I have everything else done
well
03:|
lol
what are you currently using for the recursion?
03I haven't written it LOL
03but my teacher said it should only be 4 lines
._.
03I have like
03public boolean mazeTravel(int x, int y)
03{
03	if (maze[x][y].getValue() == (mazeSize * mazeSize))
03		return true;
03	mazeTravel(x+1, y);
03	return false;
03}
real natural gas in its natural state is odorless. Nice of them to not use the rotten egg smell trope
Wow, less pings for me when I say hi today, weird.
she gona die
03and I think I'd do mazeTravel(x, y+1) and so on
03but I dunno if that would actually help
boolean? oh right
03o.o
huzzah!
FlareChaser|Octavia: get out
03well
inb4 she dies lol
FlareChaser|Octavia, kinda late.
00,10momo: lolnope
FlareChaser|Octavia: It's because you're classier.
lol bugs
heya HML
that momo
hahahah momo
dat nom
LOL
03I figure that way I'd just do a while(!mazeTravel)
03or something
Reikim: k :3
FlareChaser|Octavia: We don't dare bug such a classy mare.
ah yeah while loop
go where ever the wind takes you... man

lol :D
What are you guys watching?
ewwwwwwww
dat protein
03the other problem I see
Reikim: mare? my good sir! I am a stallion!
03is printing it

03the path should be like
unless you follow the wind into the tree
03Start-2-3-4-8-7-11-15-Exit
lol.
tehRequital|Spitfire: stallion.
03so thing with recursion
03if I have it print each time
bah
genius!
03it's gonna show it backing up?
03so I'm not sure how I'd print the final solution
03:/
huh, i heard this
07yes.
EGGZ are the solution
hm
oh no
fun fact
lol
we do this
NOOOOO :O
*GASP*
dark
funner fact, we don't use real eggs
Why do I sense something evil in the works?
FlareChaser|Octavia: Rly?
03yeah, it took me most of the day to get that stupid maze to work
03due to loop nesting
haha
I was just about to mention Xchat crashing Mint really badly
what the wa
the gas in your stove is odourless, they add the thing that makes skunk smell to it
fire temple
00,10ok so you do understand
03but I finally got it xD
and then it crashed again
:D
woah freak much
Dunnnnnnnnn

He makes weapons for the fire nation?!?!?!
03want me to pastebin my code? :P
nah
03it reads in the file and works fine
I don't want to look at java
lol
03All I need now
11,01He makes fire nations for the weapons?
03is for it to give me a solution
03to the maze
03XD
Ohlawd
lol
he makes nations fire for the weapons
00,10I offered.........my arse
He makes fire for the weapon nation?
that sounds delicious!

Hmmm....
Hi Flair
label the exit "room"/value as the final value
FlareChaser
00,10times up
aang objection pose
murder
03what do you mean label it as the final value
diing ding
hi CupcakeWarrior :3
:(
/me 11,01dusts Sumica
and if the user reaches it, it gets changed to "true" or something
so like
03that's what that initial return true
/me sneeses
03I already have that?
secret doorz
03	if (maze[x][y].getValue() == (mazeSize * mazeSize))
03		return true;
11,01You know you like it Sumica
03the value is 16
Awwww
while (endroom == false):
secret dorz ftw
03It just displays as EXIt when you print it
03:P
kill him! kill him now!
slap
0.0
so when it's not false
air slap
why does the fire nations guys always wear dresses
wind slap
Bitch slapped.
it exits the loop
Buck you fire nation.
and after the loop is a line that says "finished" or something
03does that qualify as recursion though?
Aang has mastered the long-distance bitch slap.

mmmmmmm fish
08,01my recipe involves white wine
never tried hake

too bad the fire nation is too incompetent to actually use the things well.
08,01which goes great with hake
03hm.
i may have had it and never known about it
MahBoi777: umm ok
03OK it gives me "end reached"
/me hates fish
i dont like fish in genneral

Fish <> meat
i prefer stripped Seabass

but fish is delocius
00,10I dont trust seafood this far from an ocean
08,01Luna_of_War: food, dear. no need to be a bass about it.
The fish was delish and it made quite a dish.
I have yet to eat hake. Usually, when I fish, it's either a fishstick-- or it's tuna, and uncooked. Big time sushi addict, you see.

/me realizes the truth and that the answer to life is "There is no Spoon" ~ The matrix
13slacker
mmmmmmm jelly
Shizuka: SHHHH
08,01and no, that wasn't a typo
hello

Nomnom
Jam = seeded fruit spread

sokka x princess shipping
00,10you would think waterbending would be kinda dull entertainment to a nation of waterbenders
but Shizuka, they are doing it artistically
She's a princess... and she's the moo OHH MY CELESTIA SHE'S THE HUMAN VERSION OF LUNA!

Then can't he just suffocate all the enemies?
08,01i love being up at this time
that awkward moment when you get in the van, but theres no candy....
Activity = Sxeteimz
Luna_of_War: I demand fanart of Princess Yue and Sailer Moon riding Luna

Sylandest: I'm fine, cant say much for those I know.
Sylandest: great, as usual lol

Those looked more like sabers then broadswords.
inb4 sexism

To be fair broadswords of different styles
03I've missed a bunch of quizzes
Ah

They're Chinese broadswords
That's cool

Katara IS Kana's granddaughter
Silly Katara, women can't drive. I mean, waterbend. <_< >_>

cinnamon is nice
lolwut
except featureless
good MahBoi777
that was a very grim attack
Ingwaz: part of their ability derives from the sun and from the natural heat surrounding them at all times. It is quite literally a power that draws itself from the rest of the world

hmmm....
08,01but who do you feel a personal connection to most?

The scary thing about this show is that Dan is usually got it right.

08,01Ingwaz: would you saw you identify wiht them the most emotionally?
RAWRity: Are you still writing the meanwhile fic?
I'm the most consistent and straightforward, and probably the most likely to be called "boring"
CupcakeWarrior: yes.
And the split toe sock is called a tabi. FYI.

Oh Hello SuperBrony64
Howdy SB!
Congrats?
/me gives SuperBrony64 cookies
SuperBrony64: Guess what?
Hardware failure?
08,01do you think that to be a fan of the show, you need to have had problems or insecurities that allow you to identify with one of the main characters?
THis is historical fact, actually, Except for the cookie part. Japan never had cookies-- or biscuits-- until the advent of the Wast,
/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head

Calm down FlareChaser
FlareChaser: It is simple! in a non-simple way :3
ninjato
Kid_Cobalt: TL;DR.
lol
08,01Ingwaz: but do you think it's an awesome show because you can identify with the characters, and if so, does that relate to problems you've previously had in life?
Just because I don't have a problem personally doesn't mean I can't empathize with a character that does :)
^
Oh sheet xD
08,01interesting responses so far
thats... kinda the plan
wat
exactly
/me picks up DeathStar and gives her a big hug while looking over at CupcakeWarrior, "What? :3"
lol
13elise is jim
00,10I like the show cause it made me laugh
ohai SuperBrony64!
Oh, and I never answered the first part. Discord. 'Cus making sense is dumb.
/me looks over at DeathStar "Also, Hai :3"
She had a derp face.

I've missed you SB64!! How've you been!

08,01though, you could say that violence is the basic vulgarity, common to us all
lol
11,02FlareChaser: Awesome :D
FlareChaser: I dont think she would draw clop for you
08,01though you could say that about sex too...
lol

Why not just just let Dan die?
08,01Spectrum_Rush: i off-topic a lot
Dandance.avi
clever decoy
08,01it's kinda what i do
lol
Like...he does nothing to help society.
Let him die.
Loud noises
08,01Ingwaz: <3
TRIPPY
he be tripping yo
00,10why not ponies
whoah man
lol
WELL, hes high.
Drug trips: For kids!
Tank Monkeys!
lol
lmao
no Pinkie pie's
whaa
08,01i tend to identify with twilight the most, even though pinkie is my favourite character
lol
Wait-- THIS TIME OF YEAR?
flying monkeys? this time of year?
08,01because i've had similar problems, being the lone nerd with no friends
them kids dont giv a fuc
08,01and i value friendships, a lot
/me can fly
You know what I find really sad about this mint install? The fact that my year old bloated win7 oem install was able to keep all the programs I wanted running without crashing or freezing :|
lol dan
11,01I also identify with Twilight.
Applejack is best background pony.
00,10and LA trafic gave no fucks
and I actually had an uptime that was reasonable for a laptop :D
Nah, Octavia is :3
08,01there was a point in my life, when i just started uni, where i'd never really had any real friendships before, and suddenly started making friends
Oi. Use a GUN.
this show needs more jack :)
wow
I mostly identify with Fluttershy. And a bit of Rarity as well.
lol
Who said Dan wasn't a Ninja?
do ipod emulators exist?
lol wut
The nonja is nittany
dat explosion
ninja*
lol
Am I high....?
pffft
that's why we're all here >_<
xD
hahahaha
@-@
bitch be tripping balls :O
uh wat.
i need to make more non internet friends...i like my internet friends, but non internet friends are different in their own way
08,01and that's my theory about bronies really; our strong connections are forged by not only the message of the show, but an introspection that we share in acknowledging it as something we want to identify with
Define it
Bad trip, man! Bad trip!
emulators *on* an ipod?

Or emulators that emulate ios
:p
something that can allow you to use ipod apps on your PC
08,01Ingwaz: not even that, just as a commonality
03I don't think so
ok
:D
Lol :3
:D
whump
Close Enough
Yeah, being interested because you identify with something in th show doesn't really make you "better".
FlareChaser|Octavia: check your notes
At the end of the day the undeniable fact is that the show is just good. Really good. And good HAS no demographic. :)
08,01john de lancie generalised this even more when i was tlaking to him about it the other day, saying that this need to be together, to identify and to introspect, comes from the bad things that happen in our lives; that is a common underlying cause. i'm not sure how much i agree with that, but it was certainly interesting to hear
VioletGreySha: ...Okay.... >.>
YOU TALKED WITH Q?
08,01CupcakeWarrior: i don't really want to be
Wait...you were talking with wait WHAT? :O
Switch to Android already.
there are android emulators for PC
/me com on down to BronyState, where we dicuss the psychological nature of why we are here together.
and even virtual machines of android ;D
suddenly fanboy pandamonium
08,01Ingwaz: con stuff; can't talk aobut it too much at the moment
i don't know if there is an ascension app for android
makes sense they'd communicate
D:
twilight_sprinkler: wanting to escape is normal. but thats generally not the only reason
08,01RAWRity: he's not set to be a guest there yet; we're still under negotiations
/me doesn't know what BUCK is... :/
08,01Brony UK Convention
deep coch
Petrified_Discord: British Brony convention
Petrified_Discord a con in eurpoe
oh, the uk one
Petrified_Discord: you dont know wat the buck BUCK is?
...umm...
:|
Thanks everypony :)
FlareChaser|Octavia: yesh?
He crazy
lol
woah
Sylandest: what?
08,01i'm sorry if i come off as being all boasty talking about JdL, but it's just that a lot of my life this last week or so has revolved around him and the bronycon documentary, so it's what's been on my mind the most
panicked
>poison
they should just port it to gingerbread and everybody will be happy
lol
sorta
poisoned and dead
FlareChaser|Octavia: I thought you had a question or something :$
>Defibrliator
Sylandest: nope! :P
I wish I had money to go to cons
It's true. He didn't say he was sorry.
13RAWRity: works for the infected!

08,01y'know, until someone just mentioned me being in the docu just now, i'd never even considered that i might be, except in the background doing BUCK stuff while he's filming the con. i've more been concerned with actually getting him here rather than whether he'll want my opinion on anything
FINISH HIM

it was also Carl Sagan who said that if we ever meet with an alien life form, we may not establish communication.
If we find a growing planet with life, I vote we make ponies the domanant life form
he old
we will compete for resources. communication doesn't make sense
Because that life form would either be too advanced or too backwards compared to us, but it wont be on par technologically.

There's an eBay auction for EarthBound that's like... 1,000 dollars.
console games... boring PC ftw ^3^
04$1,000 for Earthbound?
04Sounds about right
o.o
EarthBound is pretty rare
04It's that good of a title
04And it's incredibly rare
It's almost as rare as Nintendo Championchip League, if that's the name.
04So couple its cult pheonemon status with excellent gameplay and rarity and you have quite an expensive title
I love how they put out all the religious things on the original Mother, when they have religious games like "Noah's Ark" on the NES. :P
04You gotta love it :P
Um, it's a lot more complicated than that.

the derpy toy? why yes, it is a derpy
i'm still amazed
04Huh, never knew
Kandarihu: There's an actual "Nitendo's Seal of Approval" Noah's Ark game. And guess what?
Konami made it. :P
I'm going to look it up on Gamefaqs right now.
04They even have muffins on the box
04Sweet baby Jesus
it is awesome isnt it
04Very much so
04Although
04It looks like pre-G4 Derpy
AVGN's review of Mario 3 is pretty weird as hell.
There's a Robot Jesus with machine guns. I was like "what the hell"
well, it's the standart mold they keep using for that size
I see. The only Noah's Ark game I knew of was the SNES game with the Wolfenstein engine.
Oh, hello everypony.:)
ohai TheRainbowDash
04Looks like Kandarihu and myself both learned something today
You know what? The only reason I even HAVE an NES is because of Wisdom Tree. And I had to send that NES to them just to have it modded to play their games.
Kandarihu: That's awesome. So did they do it?
Yup
hay TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash hallo
any1 here watch blue xephos?
I do. :P
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I do, but not really anymore.
TheRainbowDash: they made a minecraft version of Hunger Games
Alicorn_Prince_Shane same with TheRainbowDash
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Ah, I've seen that. Pretty cool mod indeed.
To be fair to Nintendo, some of Wisdom Tree's games, the platformers in particular were pretty bad. But the games that were based on other games were alright.
The last of their NES games, Bible Buffet had a big thick booklet with questions and answers. At points in the game, players were presented with the NUMBERS of the questions and prompted to answer the questions according to what's in the booklet.
huh, have i dcd or is it just quiet
Chrysalis: Yeah, just quiet.:D
wow
I understand that having all that text in the game would've made the rom impossibly huge and required them to render text in ways their programmers just couldn't handle.
Wait, hello.....?:D
hey guys, check this out http://9gag.com/gag/4322435
man wonder who has to clean up all the bits after
no... really?
I think so Dark_Horst....
Hello TheRainbowDash
Yeah, now you just a dead pony.
Hello Twi_Fi.
04Dead pony?
Mhm Ghost.
04Does that mean they'd become ghosts?
No, no, no, no...:D
04Well that sucks
Too bad then.
o.o
04So then, what happens to them
They just die, that's all.
so just darkness?"
04That's not too bad
Yeah, it isn't, I have to admit.
ok..
LightTrooper105: It is super quiet in here.:P

So sleepy, and I just woke up.
/me gets ~5 hours of sleep everynight O_x

TheRainbowDash: Likewise.
Got out of bed 15 minutes ago.
Somehow, when you sleep a less amount of time, you feel more awake in the morning.
Cuz your body doesnt have time to go into complete shutdown i guess :D
lol
so true http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJcbn2b92AI&feature=g-vrec
No, I better get my plot to the kitchen and make me some tea.
Carpathia: Lol!! :D

/me pokes Ghosties
good point
04What?
or asleep i guess
Mmm
Ghosties: just checking if ur there
04Ah
Ghosties: Remember me telling you about MTA? do you think there could ever be a bronystate MTA event? Servers on that game can hold hundreds of people, and it's heaps of fun.
mta as in multitheft auto?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4zmmIasbV0
d3rb: mhmm
Got cooling unit yet, Ghosties?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iqv9ukUtDI
08,01mornin' all
08,01or rather, afternoon now
Morning Sat AM
Hai :2
08,01ALICORN_PRINCE_SHANE ZOMG HAI
08,01hullo xax and d3rb!
08,01and Vordox
YAY!
Dat brohoof
I got the "And"
08,01so i just went to the doctor
08,01(\
so jelly Vordox
04<Vordox> Got cooling unit yet, Ghosties? <-- No, not until mid June
08,01and he was like "have yuou been under any stress recently?"
08,01and i was like "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
Gah chat derp
:D
ughrh
so just a little bit of stress
WHY IS MY TEST NOT SHOING
08,01just a teensy, tiny bit
Trying to do a "smack"
text*
08,01anyhoos, apparently i have "sluggish bowels"
O.o
*Hm
wat :o
what are we doing
Ghosties: My question? D:
\test
Aha, so that's why...
08,01long story short, i now have a large amount of laxatives sitting on my table
08,01more than i need, surely
...
08,01so someone is going to get pranked.
Erm....
lol
?
>_>
I'm happy I have a stern stomache, all know alot of grapes are laxative to the body
get yourself sorted first......then pranks
Didn't work about 5 caskets. XD
08,01oh, also, you should all watch Sketchy Sounds' stream on Everfree Radio tonight
08,01i'm going to be jammin' with him on it
heh? no stream yet?
Weird, why is stress causing bowel hardning. That's weird symptons if anything
:o
08,01aye
08,01if no-one's streaming, i'll put it on
my favorite flavor.... EVIL~
08,01XAX: the horror! the horror!
evil
XAX: Oh, I'm back, and wow, that was...amazing.
TheRainbowDash: Any time? ._.
XAX: Wait, huh?
04<XAX> Ghosties: Remember me telling you about MTA? do you think there could ever be a bronystate MTA event? Servers on that game can hold hundreds of people, and it's heaps of fun. <-- MTA?
TheRainbowDash: Never mind, lol. Glad you had fun
08,01Vordox: university and organising a convention
XAX: Ah, I did.:D
d3rb: it's always lurkfest. Even when there are lots of people chatting.
say MTA some more.. not sure what it is :P
04Ohhhhh that
very true Kandarihu
04I dunno, not sure how many people on BronyState would be interested in something like that
04Espcially since it's technically an older game
I'd rather do fun stuff Xax. that doesn't involve killing, theft and immoral gameplay moments. :(
gta is awesome though
D:
what's an MTA?
^lol
multi theft auto, mulitplayer mod for gta, not sure whic one though
04Which came out in mid-'00's
04Actually, more like early 2000's
All the more playable, then.
it was closer to mid
sounds fun. i think i have my old gta's lieng around here somewhere
Ghosties: Which means it's cheap, which means most could buy it for an event :D
042004
04So mid 2000's
<.<
>.> Create a chat social pony game...Hur hur hur... Oh wait, need PHP connection derp
pony based mmorpg
thats where the money is
04It's not about how cheap it is, XAX
04It's about if people would enjoy it
I suppose
I wonder if it's possible to have a quadroped character on Second Life.
04It's a bit different from GTA IV
/me has never played a GTA game newer than SA
wat
should get 4 XAX its pretty good
There's not much to do in MTA. Basically a deathmatch.
04GTA IV is more "realistic"
/me has never really played any GTA game, but isn't really opposed to it.
....oh, got to go everypony.
ehm: There's a server called CIT. it's a RPG server.
04Truly a grand old time
TheRainbowDash: :( Bye bye
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/28474/Call-for-Action-- And if you haven't heard, I already started a 3rd story.
04Or is it "grand ole time"
GTA SA was pretty much the most played in internet cafes in my country years ago.
Hope that you enjoy it!:)
bye TheRainbowDash
dam it cachi isnt on
Ghosties: PRefer the original GTA myself. :P
bai TheRainbowDash
04Oh god, the original GTA?
04As in the top down GTA?
gta 1 and 2 are good games
Vordox: best soundtrack, hands down
04Ugh
04I just couldn't get into them
ehm: Eyup, original wise.
^^
The only one that comes CLOSE to that BGM is...
so many hours wasted on gta2
04Funny enough though I want Retro City Rampage
04Which looks just like the original GTA games
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4JvKl7nvL0 <--- The only song that ACTUALLY was good, and it lastedd for seconds ONLY, urgh
what no way
The people at Pokememes call the Pokemon fans who prefer the older generations "genwunners"
justice-waters of nazareth
04Okay, so, do you mean, like, best original GTA IV song or best GTA IV song period including radio songs?
That rhythm, bass, tunes....<3
it was on electro choc
Such awesome song
Exluding Radio songs, of course.
04Ah, good
Otherwise it would be no chance. D:
04Because I was really going to beg to differ
Originals are what counts, as that shows what the maker of the games can do
And not rely on outer factures.
factions
ah ok
factors...derp
But this loading song....<3 LOVE IT
Ghosties: u heard the TBOGT theme song?
04I don't know what that is
the ballad of gay tony expansion
04Ohhhhh
04No, I haven't
04But I have played the DLC
I AM going to revolutionise the gaming industry with Memory Gaming within action platform, I DECREE IT! huzzah! and stuff
I have to say, my favorite RPG is Earthbound. It somehow introduced insta-battles where you can instantly kill lower-level enemies, which makes it less annoying. :P
Hey ya'll
Vordox: Goos luck :o
Ghosties: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIu1bTFLlaY
ohai Monfang
hey Monfang
Good*
thats the song Ghosties
Xax: Thanks, going to take 20+ years :P
Wanna help me find a word?
08,01love's in blooooom
I heard it once, it's something like 'shishay' or something
Monfang: Sure.
08,01love's in applebloom
It means to move your hips back and forth in short motions
No
Like a girl would do to take off their panties in a sensual manner
._.
i dont....i ...what
08,01hmm, idea for a fic...
08,01with grown-up applebloom
/me 08,01likes writing about the future of ponies
Monfang: Not in my vocabulary...
I don't know what I heard then
08,01there's this one i started where pinkie is old and has a granddaughter
I'll just use wiggle
08,01and fluttershy is the only other one of the mane 6 still alive
08,01but is a bitter and jaded old mare
Equestrian Pie was damn depressing.
08,01and blames pinkie for the death of rainbow dash
08,01unjustly, i might add
but sounds interesting
Guess what I"m not going to read.
08,01d3rb: i like sadfic
it sounds good
What I found heartstring-playing was Pretty in Pink
dat story
/me lurks
Hai everypony :P
hey Airpuff
Airpuff: Saw you come in :<
XAX: .. aw.. =c
08,01my two favourite fics are Days of Wasp and Spider (which is a wonderfully written sci-fi fic about ponies and particle accelerators), and Romance Reports (which is an equally wonderfully written sexytimes fic, but has excellent characterisation and development)
08,01i also liked Macintosh
08,01which is just epic
08,01and Binkie Pie, which is absolutely freakin' hilarious
08,01Ancient Blunders was off to a good start too
08,01but i think it's been abandoned
O.o
xD
08,01hey Airpuff
Found a Caramel fic before. Without shipping.
:I
08,01Spell-of-Gaming: those... exist?
Why is the chat so .. dead? =c
i come back and i see yello
it was worse before Airpuff this is pretty active atm
/me sneaks up behind Airpuff
/me grabs Airpuff
D=
/me struggles
/me hugs Airpuff
To be honest, the shipping community was more demented before MLP:FiM came.
/me lurks around the chatr

Alicorn_Prince_Shane: hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane back :P
Phase4: hai

Phase4: .. okai then :P
Phase4: iz u had a enough?
08,01i've seen some absolutely adorable and well written non-sexytimes shipping fics
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, just dont feel like playing it tonight
wait a second... did someone imply there are fics out there with caramel that dont ship him with big mac?
Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade, Death came with friendly care. The opening bud to Heaven conveyed and bade it blossom there.
The original Mother was pretty much grinding and grinding.
Dark_Horst, i think i read a pinkie x caramel one
or was that bluenote
hm. i beleive i remember a caramel x twi that i saw on eqd. once
Caramel is the most used shipping victim. :I
im baaaaaaack
:)
Vordox: .. aww..
:3
Hey!
well, never read much shipping anyway
Vordox: thats adorable
I know Airpuff =3
im more for the ones with story arcs
Pretty sure I saw a Bill Clinton x Fluttershy clopf-- yeah I'm gonna stop there.
Hi!:)
Vordox, dat comic
:')
That's why I love my friends more then anything, nothing material, nothing money...Comes close to enjoying life with them.
Hey! Airpuff:)

And this show, has big marks on that.

08,01Vordox: that is one of the best things ever
/me brohooves /)*(\ Phase4.

Ohai Luna

That's great news, Luna! :3
EU makes a good choice oonce more, Luna?

I see your joy and raise you by CISPA.
08,01Dark_Horst: boredom dictates that i attempt soemthing like this
^
07,01has nothing to do with a global treaty :)
Just as SOPA was.
08,01woo, ACTA's dead! \o/
08,01rejoice!
yes, but one of those made it into the EU parliament
/me 07,01is a pirate
im just ignoring CISPA and SOPA and ACTA.

We had a relatively huge protest to ACTA here in Denmark. It got 20 seconds of air time on the news.
Vordox already did. Were friends now!
08,01the Pirate Party in the Berlin Parliament has a Pony Time in order to instil harmony and cooperation, instead of arguments and animosity
lol?
08,01they sit down and watch an episode of ponies
pirate party is best party
07,01that's awesome
You know what the fun fact is...
Our country's not bothering the ACTA stuff
/me 07,01will vote for the PP
His fav pony is Scootaloo
oh, the pirates. well then it doesnt really surprise me
behind pinkie parties that is

Oh yeah, when is Obama getting impeached?
Luna: the german PP ofc
Any new news?
Hopefully, it's done.
pirate party. you gotta love em. how many other countries have their internet community represented in the parliament?

Luna: i saw it taken down recently
07,01lol?
casued quite the ruckus
Dark_Horst: what
or is it back up`?
PB is awesome, they've been sued so many times... but still.. they always come back unscathed xD
07,01TPB won't be taken down
07,01and yea it's up
http://www.impeachobamacampaign.com/ =3
It's there. I just went on it.

07,01Speaking about Obama.. he did not bring much change...
looks like the servers derped for a few days and everyone went berserk
Change?! Ya got change?!
Luna: if elections would change anything, they would be illegal
07,01lawl
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ok Look for "Ruoska" gema blocks it for me xD
k
Meh. I rarely use TPB anyway. I use isoHunt and the likes.
the two party system is a giant hoax
Luna: Change? Lawl I see what u did thar
it give the people the illusion they have influence. but no matter who they choose, they're all after the same shit
VioletGreySha: by>?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: dats teh band name
Anyway, as for ACTA, we still have Cispa to worry about, and something else, Think it was PIPA
VioletGreySha: ahh k
Luna: wana play DD? :)
Vordox: PIPA wasn't really ever anything big, IIRC. Haven't heard a lot about it since SOPA.
VioletGreySha: thats good
07,01sure
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: IKR?
Kammerjunk: It's a switch and bait. Learn the system
Innit always, though?
\o/ hello everypony!
hay ninja_pony
Kammerjunk: For most time, but most of us people in the world is starting to learn it :P
Kammerjunk: That's why I have a very critical eye against most goverments, my own included.
If the goverment is trolling, they better ready their asses when they demand the "no trolling" rule.
I don't even like my current government. They're allegedly socialists, but they don't do a good job of anything.
Then again, Moderator did a TERRIBLE work. BUT do remember that there's factors to take in, World Economy for example caused the huge 15-20% Unemployment

Hey guys! I got a new better cast on my wrist so I can type again!
Is there a rumor flying around the internet that they're gonna make Kingdom Hearts HD collection?
Hai random bronystater Scarlet =3
ohai Scarlet
loll Onyxia
/me sleeps DeadpoolDash
yaya Scarlet
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ;o? wai?
Most of the fics in Equestria Daily don't interest me. :I
lol
04I keep hearing about a Kingdom Hearts HD collection
/me sleeps
04And I will tell you now
04I would so get it
04IF
04And only IF
04Kingdom Hearts one and two are the Final Mix versions of each title
I IZ GET NAO
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: well i wont but i think i could... :D
Ghosties: YES.
04Because NA didn't get that shit
I'd buy that
04And I am disappoint in Japan
Onyxia: give it a shot
Ghosties: Sure they are bring a HD collection, After 3D, Full Homecinema, BLU RAY collection, then HD collection.
If they include the DS games and the original mobile game (with the DS remake), MORE BONUS POINTS.
04For that matter they should include Birth By Sleep Final Mix too
Ooh, and the GBA game, too!
04So if the HD collection had the Final Mix versions of KH 1, 2, and BBS I would definitely get it
lol
/me has never really played any KH game, but isn't really opposed to it.
04Eh...not too big on Chain of Memories :I
04Nor am I big on that DS title
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: maybe sometime later coz now im learning this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=577sva6TkMw at 0:16
04But BBS felt like a proper Kingdom Hearts game
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: its hard stuff so it will take a while lol
So who is streaming the void?
YOU ARE Scarlet
You are a Temo mod
0-0
NOW STREAM FOR US!
04There's quite a few KH HD collection images
BE OUR ETERNAL STRESSRELIEF!
*tries but fails*
Ghosties iz u get scared easily
You have failed us, Executus Scarlet.
:(
You're still a bronytater though :) /) to Scarlet
If they put the Woody and Lightyear summons and more of the beta stuff seen inside the ROM of KH2 Final Mix. That would be good. :3
(\ Sweet.
04Huh
04One of these pics of the box art apparently makes it seem like BBS, KH 1, KH 2, and Chain of Memories are included
04http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/5/56679/2006963-2ld7qrp.jpg
08,01http://zero.milosz.ca/ <-- HAHAHA OH JAVASCRIPT
Lawl Ghosties
Do you REALLY want to buy that?
KH is awesome.
08,010 == [] is true
04Yes
04Yes I would buy that
im back
Ghosties: If you buy it...it's the end of KH
with ice-cream..
04...um..okay?
Ghosties: How often does collections mean the end of a series?
Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix with English crack ftw :D
derp
04Metal Gear Solid HD Collection
04God of War HD Collection
04Both of these saw new titles
That's called "Milking and making the series die out" :P
Got a new mattress. Best sleep ever.
04Suuuuuuuuuure
04Because the MK Kollection a few years ago meant that MK9 was a total failure
04Oh wait
04It wasn't
08,01Spell-of-Gaming: it's because of type-coercion
08,01== is type coercive in JS
Ghosties: There are of course exceptions
08,01which is why there is... sigh... ===
Like...several years(10+ years) that have some new steam into them
08,01PHP suffers the same problem
That's... just what the hell.
04Then you can't rightfully say that HD collections or any collections for that matter always justify the end of a series :P
08,01there is abolutely no reason ever for === to exist
Ghosties: Are you saying GoW is a good overal series, or just rehashing?
:P
08,01anyhoos, off to sort out STUFF
04I'm not saying they're good, I'm saying that there are more titles coming out in that series
04There's a difference between loss of identity and the end of a series
Hardly...
Ghosties: Well for me. I actually say that the milkin causes it. :P
04Look
04Let me give you an example
04Silent Hill
Milking it while it's hot, and milking it for easy money decades later. Atleast decades later can be a big hange.
OH GOD
04Never once had a collection series introduced to NA
04And yet it's STILL GOING
04Admittedly it's pretty damn bad these days
04Oh wait, jesus
ugh. Why did I even bother reading up on a discussion about shipping. *sigh*
04The HD Collection
04Fuck
04See
Whhut?
Ther eis one?
04That's how you know things have gotten bad
i hate shipping
04(or that I've been up all night :D)
i hate shipping too
04I'm a huge Silent Hill fan and I freaking forgot that there was a HD collection for Silent Hill
04Because the HD Collection was done baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadly
Ghosties: Of course, Silent Hill had a ..."Bumpy ride
I've only played Homecoming.
Frankly, I don't care about shipping these days but Sparity is kinda... idiotic.
But there are some that are new types of followup on the series
(Like Shattered Memories)
04Homecoming is terrible
i played them all
04The worse in the series
only SH game i ever played was 4
I know.
14hello
Ghosties: Read Silent Ponyville? :o
hi
Dominooo
04I haven't
04However
ghosties u going to see the new movie
04I honestly believe Fluttershy should have been the protagonist in the fanfic
O.o
As the hero?
14I'm so tired
04No
04As the protagonist
/me flops on his bed
But I guess I can't stop the fanfics. The only genre of fanfic I like are slice of life and adventure. I don't like any others
Ghosties: Silent Ponyville 2
Same here, Viri
Starring: fluttershy
04There's a bit of a difference between "hero" and "protagonist"
>_>
04Also
04I was talking about Silent Ponyville, XAX :P
04As in the first one :P
/me flops on the... classroom desk?
The first one was great
14xD
14good thing is that I have nothing to do tomorrow
03DROP ON THE DECK AND FLOP LIKE A FISH
04However, someone mentioned Silent Hill 4 and I must say that game was GREAT
Anyways, exam idle
03and now to go to class
Protagonist means main character, while hero means... hero. Am I right? :P
14except a stupid poetry to memorize
14see you
Silent Hill 4...
Which part was that again?
04Hero typically implies that the main character can do no wrong, or is without flaw
I can see how it can get mixed up. Usually the main character does overcome something.
Oooh
[1] != [1] but [null] == [null] makes no sense
04Silent Hill 4 was The Room
It was good?
04(Not *that* Room, BTW)
I heard quite a few people saying it was bad
04Yes
04Very, very good
In comparrison or stand alone?
04The atmosphere was surreal and eerie
Never played it. I don't like horror.
04If you compare 4 to 3, then 3 wins in Gameplay
04*gameplay
04In fact
Why are there Clockwork Nurses in Homecoming?
I need to play a Silent Hill game.
043 wins in gameplay for all original titles
Well the gameplay of SH has never been it's good part, it's storytelling is the reason the series has lived so long
Ever watch Zero Punctuation. I love his take on Silent Hill series
04The nurses in Homecoming are based off of the nurses in the movie
Movie?
Ghosties: Really?
So ghosties, you are a fan eh...
HEre's a hardcore question
Did you cry when Lisa's true fate was reveled?
Hello :3
lol Phase.
14how are you?
Ghosties? D:
Sleeeeepy~ T-T
I liked 4
its more specified value cannot equal another specified value, but 'no value' must equal 'no value'
the way everything slowly goes to shit in the real world as the story progresses was freaky
but yeah, I agree Phase. Doesn't make sense.
14aww x3
14same
x3
04Yeah, Spell. The nurses were based off of the nurses from the film
04Which were actually based off of the nurses from Silent Hill 2
Ghosties
04Did I cry when Lisa's true fate was revealed? No, but I did think it was an emotional scene, one that I'll remember
Blast from the past HERE! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm2w4aSpiqs
Yeah, I agree.
It was shocking. :(
One of the best pieces o emotional breakdowns in plain view in Game Storytelling from the earlier era of PSX.
04Definitely
04Still though
The only original monster on the Silent Hill movie was the janitor.
04I like Silent Hill 1, don't get me wrong
04I just don't like it anymore than 2, 3, or 4
I know
I'm watching it from a storytelling view. :)
Not from a "Game per game" basis
04See
04The thing about Silent Hill 4
Only else thing that gets close is when Heather finds Harry....
04Was that it was just one humongus mind fuck
Sadly, I never got ahold of the 4th. :( So don't know much about it
04It doesn't typically follow the..."atmosphere" of typical Silent Hill
04As in there's a lot of lighting, you don't have a flashlight, your inventory is reduced to a number of slots, and there are recurring creatures, Ghosts, that chase you and can't die
rawr
14and Soital
Luna, you there?
So is the Silent Hill movie worth "buying"?
07,01i'm here
Sounds like Shattered Memories. :P
04No
04Well
Luna, skype
04Maybe
A different aspect, we can say
04If you're a big fan of the series, then I would say at least rent the movie if possible
04Or borrow it
heya Viri
04Don't buy it until you've seen it
04Because it was pretty bad
Is it based on any of the games, or is it it's own tangent?
Own tangent, I think
04It takes a lot from the previous games
Loosely followed.
04The entire soundtrack is comprised from songs in the games
04But uh
04Yeah, the film loosely follows Silent Hill 1

14o.o
Sega Toylet
;p
The only thing pissing me off about that movie, is Cybil. :P
04Where Cheryl, known as Sharon in the film, gets lost in Silent Hill after a car accident
If you know what I mean as a character fate.
04Bleh
04They turned Cybil into something not Cybil
Agreed.
not to mention her part of the story at the end. ._.
THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE THING.
04But at least it somewhat follows canon
04I mean
04She does...well...
Well yeah, it WAS A choice, if I remember.
04*Spoilers*
04So I can't say
Yeah I know
I get it, Ghosties. It was a choice that could happen, but why choose THAT for the movie, damnit.
*another spoiler incoming*
04But the official canon for Cybil is ultimately followed through in the film
O.o
The sequel to the movie follows on how the hell did the kid escape from the underworld.
It was the OFFICIAL CANON!`?
Pyramid head was introduced in SH2, yeah?
04No no
04@Scarlet: Yes
LOL wow, nobody with A-G names
04Pyramid Head was introduced in Silent Hill 2
What did you mean by official canon then?
04Anyways, the ultimate fate of Cybil is followed through
04...I'll just say it
04Cybil died in Silent Hill in the first game according to canon, and she ultimately dies in the film too
14wb
...
THAT IS F*CKING BAD
She was my FAVOURITE!
>=(
04According to word of god, Cybil is no more
04Sorry bro :/
Ghosties: That would later on be confirmed TOO canon by the sequel of the Silent Hill movie. :I
%"#/%)=(&/!(/%=)/!)(!!!!!
04:<
So there is 2 SH movies?
Even too much canon exists
04Yes
04There's another film coming out
04It's in development...maybe post now
04Follows Heather Mason and her father, Harry
04Now
04Mind you
04It's the same continuity from the first film
04But I feel like there's some serious retconning going on if that's the case
Let's just hope the story is decent this time.
:I
04I mean
04Holy shit
12hihi
04And yet
04According to the second film
Ghosties: I think the plot involves on how the hell did Heather escape from the underworld. :I
04Who is now Harry
04And what the fuck happened to Rose?
WRITERS
04Bleh
04Fucking fuck
Sounds... easy to follow.
04It's confusing
Cyyyyybiiiiiiiil! *Gushes tears*
12!pokemon
Soital, you are a 10Diglett.
04Sharon and Rose, at the end of the film, escape Silent Hill *the town* and come home
04But
04They're not in the real world
04They're still ensnared by the fog reality of Silent Hill
04So
04How in the world
Oh guys....Silent Hill stories ARE f'cking hard to follow. :P
Just like Homestuck. FUCKING TIME TRAVEL SHIT.
They both used the "Clear Skies" shout.
Spell-of-Gaming: Homestuck is EASY to follow imo XD
04And I can't help but the crew spoiled a very important tidbit of info
04....wut?
04Really guys?
lolwuut
04You're just gonna let that shit go?
HAAALLLOOOYWOOOUUUUD
04You're just gonna put it out there like that?
04You couldn't save that for the film?
Writers, did you get inspiration from Homestuck? :I
04You couldn't at least have had some kind of neat twist?
Sounds like overconfidence.
04Sounds like they dn't know what they're doing...
Ghosties: Follow the game and not the movies. :P Movies have alot of issues with continuity, you should know that by now.
04but eh...maybe it'll be better than the first film
At least it's the other way around, or else. TROPETV TO THE RESCUE
PrincessLuna: whats ur oponion on the fans saying ur sister and discord were oncew together
04Of course, Vordox, but the film was brought up and so I felt compelled to speak on it :P
Sometimes, liscensed games are just bad.
Ghosties: But you get into the slums of movie knowhow then. :D
Silent Hill 2: The Movie: The Game, I hope this happens
In case you want to know about the movie, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SCENES imo of Silent Hill, so BIG SPOILERS! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC8i6kUI-R0
This is what you can begin to see.
my order for the Derpy toys are processing now, I"m thinking on sending the 2nd to my Aunt Alison in Maui - I told her about Derpy Hooves when I first got into the fandom last summer, she loves that pony :)
!pokemon
O:
AlAlicorn
Vordox: how did u like that link i sent u?
I HAD HUGE VOLUME ON
04You wanna know why I think 4 was really one of the best in the series? Because it felt like an experiment, and you can see that with the intro to the game. The title intro feels...ambitious and different...new...avant-garde, I'd say. And I believe the game follows that same feeling and style, it feels like if an art student got a hold of the Silent Hill license and make a Silent Hill
4game.
Vordox: LOLOLOLOLo
Thank you for NOT scaring me, but making the FULL FUCKING HOUSE hear it when I had my Stereoes in...
Vordox: soz
lol soz Vordox
i gota test something so have a stream about the Wii
suddenly stream
PHASE!
Phase4: What kind of test? PUZZLE GAME? :P
Also Ghosties There is ONE character I Would love to see more off, it's the Hermit Woman who can live in Silent HIll.
hmmm, we must be the backup
The only one I find interesting
on the'
is there a stream?
100!
Yes
No stream here, Phase4. :P
ah crap
down to 98
04The hermit woman?
The quality of the stream makes the canvas hard to read though, Phase4. Can you increase the sharpening?
The woman that lived outside the church
04Oh, you mean Anna?
HOLEY SHIT HE TORE HER SKIN OFF LIKE IT WAS CLOTHES
Ghosties: Think so
04^
04Yeah
04I don't think you'll be seeing Anna again :I
Scarlet: Yes....Yes...
Scarlet: I was just... oh my god what
Why not Ghosties ? D: Something happened to her?(Don't spoil in case)
Dat stream
there we go
04Scarlet...already did
what do we have here?
aparently i had the steam open three times
DO NOT USE GRAY ON GRAY TEXT IDIOTS
You have HIGH education and IQ
Think
but, i have a few questions.
woot Scarlet ?
Wasn't the SH main a guy?
04Main?
Harry yes
04Ah
04Yeah, Harry was a guy in Silent Hill 1
Pyramidhead was in SH2, not 1
04Wait, what are you asking?
The movie has a female main.
04Right
Scarlet: Ah, that's another character that has alot of screen time. Only :P
04Ohhhhhh, are you asking why Pyramid Head was in the movie?
Yes, ghosties
04Because
04Fan service
lol
*cough*
Ghosties: Actually, JANITOR IDIOT
Ghosties: Not to mention the REALLY stupid way they explain him....If you knw what I mean, Ghosties . ._.
04There was zero reason for Pyramid Head to be in the movie
04He's an executioner that punishes people
I commented on drf's profile
04They're not flawed characters
EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE IT!
lol no
14o.o
buthi
butthi
but hi
ffs
14butthi
stuf
stuf
stfu
can't type today
LOL butthi
14xD
I think the appearance of Pyramid Head in the movie was purely fanservice
04And I hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE his design in the film
I hate how the sudden fanservice. :I
....
Ghosties: THIS.
LOLWUT reaction there Ghosties
WHY NOT
04Fucking anime girls LOVE him now and shit
Ghosties: Wasn't there a way to explain it based on Harry's "being there"?
Ghosties: anime fangrils loe anything without a shirt
hiii
byee
*love
Nono, I mean WHY Pyramid head EXISTS cause of Harry
(Game wise was it then?)
no u
drf go check your profile
04Pyramid Head doesn't exist for any one character
link it
StupidSexyCJ: Visual novels are guilty of this. :I
don't judge me
>phone
I'm bored
I think he did, I remember it being explained somewhere and I got pissed and stopped reading. ><
04And you're thinking of James from Silent Hill 2, because that was PH's introduction into the series
I judge you all I want
Thanks
08,01so much red
:O
That's all I wanted to know
08,01<3
you can link by profile name?
04Silent Hill is serious business
It was something like "Harry" or "James" had some issues of consciences that MADE PH to be existing?
that's the link I got...
04Right, you're thinking of James
...
where the fri=k
*c
did you get that
That's terrifying..
04And on that...I don't believe Pyramid Head was made for only James
that's about as good as the show itself
:P
Well, it was explained at that time. Not the following and merely got retconned or something.
04I think Pyramid Head manifested because James wanted him to, because he wanted to be punished for his actions
O:
YES!
That part.
14o.o
04It wasn't that James *made up* Pyramid Head
so ghosties what is your fav sh game
042
o.o?
lmfao
o.o
Ghosties: I think there's a Barbie doll coming in the new Silent Hill game.
04I know, kinda expected since everybody and their grandmothers love Silent Hill 2
I was just... what.
is that on the hd collection
04Yes
14I like the show
i will play it then

Phase4: how long is this? :P
I think you forgot to take your love pills this morning
none of those people are me
you need to go back to your dorm and eat 5 of them
Spell-of-Gaming, bout an hour
04Then get it for the PS2 instead, the HD collection is riddled with bugs and glaring graphical inconsistencies
I would have to be really high to find talking colored horses amusing
LOL love pills

I know that, but it was a gereral burn of your favourite Explorer ;)

this isn't working on it
:p
drf, have you watched any of it?
why did you provoke me with that :P
cus'
it's lulzy
it wasn't meant to provoke
04Ah, yes, that's right. I thought you said you had the game already on Xbox :P
it was meant to make everyone go wtf
even better
Phase4: Why does it sound like WII is a pretty solid system...
04Still, get it on PS2 if you can
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17036030/lolidonteven.gif
GO GO GO
Vordox, because in theory it is
i will

O.o
I like that you add "theory"
The Wii is some serious shit.

It seriously prints money.

Wii was smart making this system, let's see how good it holds up!
Nintendo's partition system was genious.
i give it 1 yr before the wii u gets hacked
14old joke :(
heh
next week the wii u gets unveiled
When was this, Phase4?
Nice timing ffor this then TheSpitFirecolt

Not hack it
Spell-of-Gaming, few years ago
good time for a new system since nothing is coming out
I should do that too
...that's kind of a lie.
I can upload mine :D
It depends on the game if it has "Castlevania syndrome".

Garbage data.

uggggggh math homework
The only reason why Mother 3 is far from being hacked is because of the compress data.
JRP2234[iPhone], you there?
:O
14drf
Yes
Phase4: You're teaching hackers here on Bronystate? XD
14have you ever watched a MLP episode? :D
Vordox, indeed :)
Well the goverment of USA DID say we were WORSE then terrorists, let's show them. :P
I don't usually xD
and I used to HATE mlp
Like REALLY hate it xD
playing pirated games on the wii == worse than 911
seems legit
But I tried it, and I liked it :P
XD
mainly what I hate is the fact that it's impossible to go anywhere online without seeing MLP stuff
Phase4: What the hell.
12not even fox and the hound? =o
14lol, drf
14I feel the same way with minecraft
no other TV show is that bad >_>
For goodness sake man...
14don't get me wrong, I like the game
Minecraft isn't as bad
14BUT STOP TALKING ABOUT IT ANYWHERE
14X_X
14same thing with portal
as I only see the images on gaming sites
14I love that game, now shut up Dx
people post MLP stuff EVERYWHERE
this here is talk about the kernel on the starlet
opinions.jpg
see
12a lot of things get overhyped thats all
standard unix variant
I don't mind opinions
and eh, haven't seen FatH since I was like 5
but once people start shoving it down my throat
I don't like movies like Bambi though
THAT'S when I get annoyed
14^
same here derp
the fact that it's a custom kernel is strange and a bad choice as you will see here
and you're doing it atm drf
hence my hatred of bronies
12hmm didn't know that =o
or at least on some level
so derp
anywaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
What is hollywood?

flutter_spin, hacking the Wii
mfw Chocolate Buttons in the pantry
Hacking the Wii with the Linux
nice. So what motivated you to show this?
*insert table flip here*
its always Korea.
'the ps3 security system is strong' his face when he was in the ps3 hack talk
They can hack a console, they can't push a button, WHERE IS THE WORLD GOING TO!?
Hello LunaLookin
which i streamed a while ago
I just finished reading an article about Koreans demanding money refunds because they couldn't log into Diablo 3. Korea is having a fit with Blizzard right now.
Vordox: Touch screens can be annoying sometimes
With the small buttons and all
Spell-of-Gaming: Who the feck uses touchpads...?
anyone who loves their iphone
Vordox: ...Apple.
I laugh at those :P
And Android.
like ... sigh, my mom
and uncles.
Hello chrysalis
Hiya twi_fi
the homebrew channel is an excelent bit of software
and every console should have a vendor suported version to allow user code
hi
ohai Mish
Hello Mish
that dude is cool. He has a handless mic :)
All did, then Sony got rid of it
:) I have a god 45 min. before the school bus arrives
Sad truth, Phase
chrysalis, xbox doesnt
Hm?
you can develop on the pc but cant actualy get it onto the console without paying for a licence
interesting vid. I don't think I learned anything new, but neat.
Good morning, all.
dat video womt show up
G'day WallDives
WhY aren't you guys LEARNING?
<.<
and the ps3 one was more limited than it needed to be
The hakcers.
Good morning everypony
Hackers?!
0-0
hardware hackers
who got hit?
When did dat happen?
Phase4: Why are they so dumb they cannot see what consequences they are causing, Phase4?
this was from 2008
Even after proving it over and over and over again
when they hacked the Wii
ah.
Vordox, because managment afaik
Management for what?
Why must I get tired just before leaving for work? I wake up 2 hours beforehand, wide awake, and before leaving to work I want to sleep.
Why would anypony want to hack anyone? For the ching ching?
:( my mom won't let me stay in school during the last extra mounth of school after 8th grade graduation
A simple "I want to add this background" causes hug gaps into the gaming society ><
hey guys
managment in microsoft nintendo and sony
less sony than the others but still
now I can't stay to visit the highschool with the rest of my book club :(
Phase4: No Ididdn't mean like that. ><
hackers are not a market they target, which is a little silly
hi alexxm.
Remember the Half Life Source code f'ckup? LIKE THAT
hey WallDives what have you been up to
alexxm: So, Orton is suspended.
This is the same thing, happening over and over again
I hate that I have no idea what anypony is talking about, so I'll just shut up and listen
yeah i heard about that WallDives what did they get him on
is there a stream going on
Crap! Bus COME BACK!
the ps3 was a special case, after they removed linux hackers poured into it
and thus it was hacked
lol Mish. There was a stream.
alexxm: dem drugs.
several times
and some realy stupid bugs were found deep in the system
so how long is he off WallDives
allso bootmii is better than the stock bootloader
less likley to brick
alexxm, 2nd offense, 60 days.
default bootloader bricked ~1% of consoles on one or two of the system updates
/me licks alexxm
Do you think they just finally gave up on fixing all the bugs and released it, due to pressure of producers?
huh lot of people have been caught lately WallDives
/me hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane hows your day been
good alexxm
Stream just buffered for meh
yeah, i'm not streaming anything right now
stream just ended. I gotta' go anyways
alexxm, not really. Just a shallow roster, either because of lack of prepardness, or because FCW has a lot of their talent atm. They're in a rebuild phase.
04Oh god, Bushido Blade
have some music
04It's been sooooooooo long
04Whoa, whoa, whoa
04>FCW
04Someone is either a smark or a mark
04More than likely a smark
Quiet day in the prison camp today is it not?
04And then WallDives doesn't speak :/
Hello Iron_Edge
sorry Ghosties.
Twi_Fi: I love you....
Twi_Fi: Your name :)
I'm more casual, but I folow.
Iron_Edge: Thanks :D
WallDives: /)
follow^
04You know FCW
so, I guess i'd be a "smark" by definition, since I look at dirt sheets, although I just take it more as a show as is, than anything serious.
I do.
hey Iron_Edge hows your day been
I also know OVW, and I've been to some ROH events.
alexxm: Meh
04Ah, so then you're like my friend who doesn't really watch the shows every week but follows the stories and angles through the net
WallDives: Oh....thats kool ignore me...
sorry Iron_Edge.
Ghosties, I do watch the shows every week.
04I've never been to Ring of Honor, though I'd like to
04Oh?
WallDives: no no.....too ******* late...
Stream is down? D:
04Then I wouldn't really call you a casual :P
/me likes this song
Vordox, its what now?
Oh, playing song, dang
Ghosties, there was a championship match near where I lived.
Nothing, I just found a great song. =3 That I wanted to share
actually, the day before a RAW was there.
Dream Evil: The Chosen Ones.
Iron_Edge, sorry, 3 different conversations.
04Speaking on the indy feds, I'd love to go to CHIKARA sometime
i would go to a ring of honor show but i don't think they come to england
yeah, true damn story.
WallDives: /) <----thats all I did.. but its kool guy..
Iron_Edge, (\
WallDives: *Rejects your bro hoof*
No stream, or did mine derp? :P
Ghosties, yeah, I'm pretty firmly planted in former JCP/WCW/FCW land.
Spell-of-Gaming: Your derpin bro.
04Never heard of JCP, though it does sound familiar...
Ello there everypony.
Ghosties: JC pennies....-lol
hi Malavolent.
Hello Malavolent
no.
Malavolent: /)
o hai Malavolent
Jim Crokett Promotions.
Iron_Edge: Oh wel... (\
the predecessor to WCW.
Malavolent: Thats how I say hi.....problem bro????
04OHHHHH
04Jim Crocket
hey Malavolent hows your day been
Iron_Edge: Not really, should it be a problem?
04The territory
yeah.
04Now I know what you're talking about
dat South Ohio.
alexxm: Hey, quite okay, how about you?
No stream, I see?
:P
Malavolent: Nah, I'm just pulling your tail guy. :)
i really started getting into wrestling last year to be honest
i'm good Malavolent
04No wrong time to get into wrestling
04Plenty of things to look at in the past
04For when you have a shit present product
Ghosties: Explain something to me then
I was in-and-out. I watched WCW and ECW when I was younger, after the buyouts, I kinda dropped off.
04Yep?
Ghosties: Is that stuff real?
hell no.
04Define "real"
Ghosties: Cause some of the punches look kinda if-y to me
old undertaker matches started it for me so i got the undertakers dvd
04Some of the punches can be real
real enough for injury, not real fights.
04But that's called
04"being stiff"
04When you actually connect attacks
04The injuries are real (typically, unless it's part of an angle)
Ghosties: I mean the most painful thing i've ever seen is someone getting a broken arm
04But the animosity or whatever? The "hate" between one wrestler and another is purely for show
04The feuds are fake
04Or rather scripted
Ghosties: Aside from that. For giant men with hercules bodies they dont seem to genuily hurt each other at all. If ever.
04The feuds are scripted
04Well that's called "no selling" if they don't react to getting "hurt"
Hogan is famous for it.
04So is Warrior
so's undertaker
so is Taker, Goldberg, Warrior...
04Oh god, Warrior is soooooo famous
04Actually
Ghosties: Ehhh.....Then why is it millions of rubes will pay out the whazoo to go and see a LIE
04I'd consider "no selling" to be a part of Taker's gimmick
same here Ghosties
04He "rises from the dead" after seemingly getting hit with a particularly "devestating maneuver"
although, Warrior is more famous for being nuts.
04Because, Iron_Edge, for the entertainment
Ghosties: Wow
yep.
didn't he actully change his name to warrior WallDives
alexxm, he did.
Why do people see films, they are fake too
Ghosties: your the first person to actually give a legit reason for that question.
NO STREAM? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qLlyqR19gU
Good day everypony :P
04You don't watch to see two men fight, if you want to see a real fight then watch boxing or UFC
Hello Nerom
hey Nerom hows your day been
ohai Nerom
hi Nerom.
I was at Bellator 2.
Heyall :)
04But yes, pro wrestling is theatrical
04It's a play, of sorts
Ghosties: Thats kinda boring to a point though. In UFC one guy falls on the ground then they lay there in the missionary for awhile beating each other with there hands up until one guy is hurt to bad.
i actully went to a show this british promotion did near where i live
04Well that's why pro wrestling is typically faster
04In real fights it's meticulous
Ghosties: Atleast with wrestling they throw each other out of the ring and stuff.
Iron everyone enjoys different aspects of it
04The action is slow paced, because acting too fast means that you're going to make a mistake and get punished for it
yeah.
04That's a real fight in boxing or UFC
04Especially boxing
and god help you if you miss a takedown.
04But in wrestling it's all choreographed
04There are specific spots that wrestlers will do
Ghosties: And thats what kills me about it.
To about 60% yes
And all the talk is BS
Ghosties: I want to see completely random acts of violence. In a ring. With wrestlers.
In wrestling that is
its entertaining, though.
04Haha
04Nah
Indeed
its also entertaining when they botch.
04Sorry
04Go watch TNA if you want just random spouts of violence
04That place is a fucking mess
But to much comersals for my taste
TNA is getting better, imo.
Iron_Edge check out some hardcore matches then
Ghosties: -lol-
04At least they got Russo out of there
lol i will lol the day some one streams UFC
04God
well, cou could also watch these two fight. a lot more entertaining than wrestling, if you ask me http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwNVQvygCNQ
Also, Ghosties, you watch Botchamania?
04YES
04All the time
This is awesome Dark_Horst
04I was about to say that you have a point, that botches can be *hilarious*
Japan is crazy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deC2uxu0XA4 :P
04Especially if you know the context behind a certain botch
right.
04But sometimes botches can be really dangerous
04Sometimes they end up getting actually hurt
dont forget Brawl for All.
04What was Brawl for All?
like that pedrigree that turned into a piledriver Ghosties
that was the reason why I didnt watch attitude-era WWE.
WWF, whatever.
I'm not a big wrestling fan but then again if you saw me in real time you wouldnt think I have a twilight sparkle plushie.
Ghosties, a shoot-fight tournament.
04Ah
04Those
Life is fun with stereo types. There natures little secret holders.
Russo!
04WWF doesn't promote those anymore
04Er
04WWE, rather
pretty much ended the career of Dr. Death.
04Poor bastard
that man was AWESOME.
04He's dead now too
yeah, sadly.
04Yeah
Ghosties: Ojh the irony.
04Eh
04Maybe
he survived cancer, then it came back.
04But I don't really laugh at wrestlers dying
throat cancer at that.
04I've been a wrestling fan since I was a kid
04I'm 24 now
Ghosties: same here.
I cant say I feel bad for people who smoke and get cancer.
23 though.
04If you want pure entertainment, go WWE
04If you want...whatever the fuck TNA is, go TNA
Honestly, it says on the pack "this will probably give you cancer....cancer is bad"
04If you want pure wrestling, legitimate wrestling, go ROH
Hello valoreins and Onyxia
04If you want referential self humor and wrestling that doesn't take itself too seriously, go CHIKARA
ohai bronystate :D
;o
hi
Like I said, TNA is getting better, though.
valoreins: /)
Twi_Fi: when did u see me join? mIRC?
I'm actually suprised to hear that Vocaloid concerts have singers backstage, which is really cool.
04Because there's nothing like selling an invisible hand grenade
hi Onyxia, valoreins.
Onyxia: /)
hey valoreins and Onyxia hows your day been
Hello Dken2021
04Oh my god, it was the most amazing thing I ever saw in my life

The singers who provided their voice on a Vocaloid, I mean.:P
hahaha.
Twi_Fi: sweet :P
ohai Twi_Fi
Ghosties: -lol- wow that was a random statement.
04And they actually *slow down time, including the commentators*
04Everybody goes and talks in slow motion once the grenade is tossed
does chirkra do region free dvds Ghosties i want to check that out
04I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did
I was just dropping by, I should be working, bai

Hai everypony!
|Discord|: /)
hey |Discord| hows your day been
http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/30/politics/romney-unicorn/index.html
howdy, |Discord|
o hai |Discord|
Phaaase!
cowvarkian: oh my sweet celestia
the fact that that is on CNN makes me smile.
good to hear |Discord|
panda I agree. Still though I can't help but wonder why the media hasn't asked about this sooner.
it be satire panda...
Iron_Edge 350kbit/s is the maximum I can get in my villige XD, mabe I should buy 30miles of Fiber to connect it to somewhere...
Do you remember a certain 3D short movie about sackboys, but in 3D movie with a big "Robot cat/dog"thingie?
panda, the birth certificate was verified.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/eabnzsfgzegqeu5817yuzq2.gif
Nothing is being streamed? Why?
cowvarkian: god I hope so
And thse sacks had souls in them?
WallDives: when? :p
he was born on a base in Panima.
|Discord|: we just finished a short film, should be up again in a moment
Panama^
Sylandest: What short film was it?
heck yeah, 2 new Albums in the Indie Music Bundle :D
do you honestly think that people are asking if romney is a unicorn?
WallDives: XD so it was just a douche and terd sandwich election XD
Lil_B: -lol- they tell you that technology is the fututre. And then stuff starts failing. Meh
|Discord because they're having one more drink at the sunken norwgien
he's obviously a pegasus
|Discord|: Elephant's Dreams, I believe it was called
cowvarkian: Obviously
cowvarkian: its just satire of the "birthers"
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/apdhj-h7qkcb8yz1nmj77q2.gif
Romney's dad was born in Mexico and he ran for President.
I know StupidSexyCJ
Sylandest: Ah sounds nice. Wonder if they would ever stream stuff from newgrounds?
RAWRity: -lol-
yeah, I know panda...
panda, proof: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hawaii-verifies-president-obama-birth-records-arizona-elections-chief-ken-bennett-article-1.1083039
|Discord|: dunno. Ask Phase or the next streamer to see if they'd be up for it, hehe :)
I WILL
and that, as they say, is that.
ill brb
WallDives: That only proves how vast and deep the coverup is.
Phase4: Would you guys ever stream stuff from newgrounds?
I DID HA
WallDives: ah i see... so it was recent... hm... fishy as fuck though...
|Discord|: so you did. Now you see if Phase answers, lol
Mares and Gentlecolts, I present to you...The McScootaloo: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/k7jlj1shyusr2m54qrjnlq2.png
people only see what they want to see. Legally, all the proof is right there. Debating anything without the evidence is a waste of time.
Im pretty sure phase4 is now a vegetable asleep on his keyboard -lol-
RAWRity: What madness is this?
MADNESS
/me orders a McScootaloo
That's right, YOU CAN NOW EAT SCOOTALOO
WallDives: true... but... its a little wierd that it NOW comes up when he is running for reelection... tbh he should have been impeached a while ago >.>
:c
Well, the Obama-ate-dog people proved how stupid the whole dog scandal is. hopefully this unicorn thing will have similar success.
|Discord|: the power of a good marketing campaign and the effectiveness of the internet combined
RAWRity: this taste like rainbows....
panda, on what grounds? you cant have Kenyan dual citizenship.
Scootaloo: -lol-
nope, just eating
Sylandest: It is to powerful...My brain is going to explode!
Iron_Edge: wait... you licked a pony?
rainbow factory is to blame for the spread of McScootaloo
MMMM, poof*Brain explodes
panda: Dont judge me....:c
Iron_Edge: JUDGE JUDGE JUDGE
WallDives: I dunno... and yes you can... cant you?
|Discord|: *sad face*
did it taste like raisons?
yes
Iron_Edge: ULTIMATE JUDGE
Iron_Edge: i wont judge you ^^
panda: Then all my Wubs to you ^-^
Iron_Edge: but... I cant accept all your wubs!
Iron_Edge: considerin Pinkie goes around lickin nearly everypony in town, I can't say ah'd judge you
|Discord|: *curls up in corner*
panda, NOPE. Kenyan immagration law says that to have Citizenship, YOU MUST renounce all other citizenships from all other countries.
Immigration^
Iron_Edge: My wubs are locked in a stero
panda: Then you will drown in them like the rest...
Iron_Edge: Ma hearts a stero it beats fro you so listen close!
Sylandest: -lol- its addicting
WallDives: hm... so... he was a kenyan citizen... but renounced it.
OH OH
|Discord|: hear my thoughts in every note?
|Discord|: Wow.....that qoute was actually beautiful...
...
Naked face eating zombie? Please don't be black, Please don't be black...
how do i immigrate? *spideyshrug*
Sylandest: Come make me your radio!
panda, no, his father was, he lived there briefely (his family was missionaries or something similar iirc), and he was born here, as the documentation shows.

Sylandest: This small ID was set for you so sing along to my stero!(GYM CLASS HEROS BABY!)
Iron_Edge: :D
just kidding.
>.>
|Discord|: haha! I've heard the song too often to not know it
WallDives: well... i know mexicans who have "birth certificates" so.... it doesnt prove anything to me :(
They are now trying to make it Illegal for scientists to measure if the sea level is rising, because coastal counties would be harshly effected by rising sea levels.
Phase4: Could you stream newgrounds stuff if you wanted to?
Same :3
THEY ARE TRYING TO FIX A NATURALLY OCCURING PROBLEM BY IGNORING IT
:(
13Good to hear~

Airpuff: army video on scaring away birds for plane safety
/me hugs Airpuff
panda, if you have reason to doubt, go ahead, but hard evidence will always crush theory, until disproven.
Sylandest: Then when they get into the engines it will GRIND EM UP!
My friend's dad actually does this stuff for a living.

cowvarkian: hehehe! :D
Sylandest yes... I think :?
alexxm I was just joking XD
Lil_B: then its all for the better, hehe. If anything, you can say that you know ponies all around the world XD
ah right Lil_B
I think I would say people Sylandest, unless I was talking to other bronies
cowvarkian: yes, you're right there, lol. Good point
xD
brb
Sylandest there are at lest 2 Gilrs in my class that really like Ponys and horses... but only RL ones and they have never heard about the show
/me jumps on Sylandest.
/me catches CrazyCherry and hugs :)
well then Lil_B
Lil_B: well, its a start...maybe? :$
are you sure we're watching a show for girls then Lil_B ?
/me hugs Sylandest back.
Lil_B: ... i see possibilities..
CrazyCherry: told ya everypony would be here for ya, didn't I? ;) hehe :D
Sylandest well, one of them I really like, and I think she would be the kind of girl who would give this show a chance, but the other one... never XD
thats... good?
Lil_B: Give it a go! Might be it turns out ... unexpectedly good? xD
Lil_B: then show it to the first gal and see what she says, hehe. Its better to try it with someone with an open mind than someone who would outright reject it from the get-go
Sylandest: Yeah.
Good evening everypony.
