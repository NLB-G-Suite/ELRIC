>user named ya
00,10press play
Eli: it is extremely overrated
this is awkward
Gregwil7 was going to, but I'm out of money so I'll wait a bit
vampire sweetiebelle?
Bronysith: it's still a good rpg, right?
Eli: it just doesnt live up to the hype, but hey doesnt mean it is not enjoyable, have fun
Lil_B, have you actually played Warlords Battlecry 3?
Well I'm in the EU so yeah...
/me almost has a heart attack because of dogs barking
Invi no
aw
CrystalPhoenix: Gah so adorable
Eli: eh, personally i think fallout is a better RPG series
mew is bad driver,apparentlly.
Bronysith: it is
Bronysith: if i would go with the hype i would have bought it years ago.... i just like good rpgs
btw, heck out this motherfucker of a salad http://www.wolff-catering.de/WebRoot/Store3/Shops/62168388/4A23/B9D4/7D54/81B6/E1E8/C0A8/28B8/335E/fleischsalat_m.jpg

and yes, that is pure sausage meat
Eli: it is good, not fantastic, just good
Gregwil7: what, is there a ban or something?
Different release date...
ahh...
Gregwil7 you may wanna look at the Zombi-U WiiU Bundle, comes with Zombi U and the Pro Controller and the Deluxe version, 399€ (would safe abou 30-50 € if you wanted to get Zombi U and the Controller anyway
Eli: if you want fantastic, get fallout 1, 2 and 3, and new vegas
german cuisine. leave it to us to make something completely devoid of vegetables and call it salad
00,10lol "pure sauage"
What baffles me the most is that Japan get's it last
later all. Im going to go play skyrim
WAIT
Bye Jageman :)
00,10wrek, sausay Tavi
Bronysith: isn't that more fpsrpg?

Eli: skyrim is FPS
FP SHOOTER?
Eli: i mean, first person
Okay better
can be shooter, if you use bows :D
Sumica: we call it the fleischslat.
Argh
Bronysith: it's the shooter part that really bugs me...
It has amazing physics too
Eli: fallout is just an overall better series
Specially when you're on a Horse
00,10bless you Dark_Horst
Bronysith: opinions.
Horses are fucking Wizards.
spike is best pony? what?
Also
Sumica, translated it means meat salad
Mod it to hell
MOD.IT.Otherwise it sucks.

LPS is like a refreshing chill reggae remix of MLP, with a cool milkshake in my hoof. :3
LPS is a bit less girly than most other girl shows but not as good as MLP
i gotta make food for myself

Does ANYONE here live in Italy?
Nope, im from denmark
nope, germany
i come from that crystal copy lake mirrof water thingy

Well Steam ins't good too i guess because the internet keeps falling
Btw whos streaming right now?
Right?
00,10basickly it's like poking a hole in your firewall for certen programs
Jmo: I think MadSurge does
Imo I know one who does, why u asking?
Gold_Demona, isn't MadSurge from Italy?
alexxm: clicked the links? that andre giant guy really doesnt like hulk hogan
Yesh Jmo
Italy is wolves and bears and mafia
Sumica, can you tell me how to do it :C
I need to talk to him
united states of equestria
i cant wait 22 hours to play AC3.
00,10not in detail cause the how to depends on your hardware and the program
Bye everyone

00,10then I just pick the program from a list
Malmortius: i'm not sure, I have a computer with decent internet, yet ACII and ACB run like molasses going up hill

Welp, I got some housewife stuff to do. Cleaning the house and whatnot. afk for a bit.

*yawn* mornin' folks
HAH!
Haio MirrorImage

6_9 : Yum yum c:
first you jiggle your tail, oink oink oink, then you wriggle your snout oinkoinkoink then you wiggle your rump oinkoinkoink then shout it out oinkoinkoink!
hey MirrorImage
no, bad princess! BAD
ill be back in 2 hours, hope Wrek is still streaming then <.< i hate it missing his awesome art streams xD bb everypony :D
:P
Hai guyz :D
I mean :)
Dammit make the same mistake every time
i'm a pony
So who's this guy supposed to be? Slendermane?
@justin, who?
THe drawing
oh hey, wrek stream
/me facehoofs and it makes a CLANG snound*
Or am I looking at somethin different from everyone else?
no, i don't think you are
Cause if I am my computers once again an asshole
what? snound? lol i mean sound
05back
05was gettign a bit chilly so i had to close the window
So what is this drawing?
grab a blanket
Oh lemme guess you live in the Midwest like me? :)
ssssllllllooooooowwwwwwwww mmmmmmoooooootttttiiiiioooooonnnnnn
Whats with the new video player?
are you guys still streaming? what is it now?
Justin - turns out Mips is vulnerable to streamjackings
so no more Mips
Oh I see.
Fucking /v/
don't think it was /v/
whats a /v/?
I was told it was /v/
It wasn't /v/ for gods sake.
It was the GNAA. /v/ has nothing against bronies.
This has been explained multiple times.
Sorry.
didn't get teh memo
guys what's a /v/? or the GNAA?
the GNAA are the assholes who hacked the stream yesterday
do they usually do that?
*eats a muffin* *spits it out* WHUT?
s
hijacked not hacked
damn it
muffin_mix: one is a board on 4chan. The other you should google for yourself.
05it wasnt /v/ and it wasnt a hack
05it was a loophole in mips that caused it
*REVERSES* oh. *eats muffin*
05they didnt even have to hack anything
@Wrek don't split hairs
/me splits 100 hairs
Justin - the point is that a "hack" sounds so much worse than a "loophole"
/me hops up and down for no discernable reason
Touche
/me can't do the slash over the e
When did it happen? I overslept the episode.
Like between 9:00 and 9:30
05no
DaringDerpy - they got it one during the opening scene, and did it again overnight at about 1AM EST
05sayign it was a hack gives the responsible ones muuuuuch more credit that they deserve
http://xkcd.com/932/
wrek, i think your text is red
MirrorImage: ok, thx
05nice observation
Yeah. We should probably tell these uninitiated ones what the hijack image consisted of
GTG
Wrek: Im surprised you haven't gone psycho yet for answering the same questions for over 24 hours now :D
Wait I know...
this is Deadpool!
or the guy from Assassins Creed
Altair or Ezzio ?
The guy you play as
Never played Assassins Creed so I dont know.
Justin: you play as both
The dude with the cape
What he making
lolz
ac 1 was boring...but part 3 seems to be awesome. from the trailers. you can command fregates and stuff
mfw people still aren't over yesterday's failed attempts to take over the stream. :P
i am
I was just tryna explain it.
I wasn't here
I really don't give a shit.
What's in the past is in the past
So fuck it
naaa. if it happens again, it's not in the past
It wont.
We have a new player.
GOD HIMSELF CANNOT SINK THIS SHIP!
/me is an atheist
Justin : this pony ? http://i55.tinypic.com/2psqclw.jpg
fiddlesticks?
Yeah his crazy ass.
her*
ok...
that's Octavia...
you're shitting me
who else do you know who would use cello bows?
octavia is puts the laughter in slaughter
Didn't notice those.
-is
/me is still an atheist
lawl
:D
I still think its Deadpool
she is too awesome to laugh
never heard of them, Justin
05i.. what
05the fuq
Daring Derpy: Which rock do you live under?
Is it Tom?
not a gamer nor tv consumer, Justin
Comic reader?
not really
only real books
Oh you're a hipster aren't you? :P
no, I did this before hipsters were cool :P
r/nick muffin_mix
smooth -_-
Kevin Spacey: WRONG
05good one on ya
no nick for you
Hell yeah
05so far so good yes?
BRB
So is it Deadpool or not?
05why would i draw deadpool?
Cause he's frikkin awesome?
So who will this pony be, Wrek?
05not reason enough
Or will it remain a surprise?
Mare-Do-Well?
I think it'll be Legolas
it has no nose. like spiderman
It has the same neck shape as Legolas
:|
r/nick muffin_mix has returned!!
if deadpool needs to be drawn he will call you and tell you , 4th wall breaker you know !
Its Legolas
Wrek is drawing again? Cool
yep
either robot or hindu
L kiek Wrek
ninja robot
or the spot for the horn ?
Thanks for that
horn...yes
I needed a good laugh :D
d
oops
Robot ninja zombie pirate pony.
from outer space
Samus?
Ninja Pony, or super sentai/power ranger pony?
Samus teh unicorn?
I wonder if this will be saucy or not
not plot dominated enough
That's a really sharp horn
horn of death
hm...
Wait is this the vector drawing style I've heard about?
i know exactly what to do
/me plays LoZ majora's mask*
/me plays Smashing Pumpkins
Babs' favorite band.
Wait I know!
eats a muffin
yum yum
:D
Hai everypony
hi
Dat collar bone

Hai DerpyMuffins :)
hai gyus
Oh yay, Wrek stream
Who he drawing?
Mare-do-well, maybe?
NMM?
No one knows and he refuses to say anything
good evening
It's a unicorn
Hai Diamond_Tiara_2012 :)
Horn is too short to be Alicorn
my whole apartment smells like peach now. but no foamsplosion in the bathroom.
mission accomplished
It's a mare
i belive i know what hes drawing but ima keep it a secret for now
A super long sexy tail would work well here I think.
Judging by the width of the mouth
What mouth?
i think it might be a pony
no rectangular snout
female
I hope its a pony, I liek ponies :P
huh?
I like apples
ARGH wheres the stream site again?
It is a pony
a pony is fine too
Derpy: also, do you remmeber the last time wrek has drawn a male pony?
A unicorn
* DaringDerpy
now that you ask, Dark_Horst...not really
:P
and somepony link me the site again?
Great and powerful OC pony
Wrek likes his sauce
So where's Shizuka?
in my basement
She got some long legs though
she's here mostly at 0400 utc or so
fyi guys this pic is more than likely a twilight sparkle
yes
the legs!
ON AND ON
LONG LEGS! <3
Inb4 it's Vinyl
who you drawing? do you take requests whoever you are??
Rarity.
pinkieclone: it's Wrek
It's Vinyl
Rarity.
Rarity
ITZ BLUEBLOOOS
;)
i'm getting 3 different answers D:
Mar doe well Twilight?
Dat Sumica OC
Why the gravy soaked fuck would Twilight be white?
spidermare
i bet its derpy
It looks like Rarity kinda.
its twilight crossed with somthing. not gonna say what though quite yet
Mare do Well Rarity?
Rex_Mundi I see you finally found it
you say that becasue white
and no its not mare do well
it has a white jihab
is this guy only gonna draw this?
not to be rude ^^
probably a ninja
o wait
it might be rarity
Maybe a power ranger
it makes more sense to do a rarity
ITS A PUMBLOOM
im being dumb now so ill shut up
Cause Rarity is underappreciated.
Rarity is class
Rarity needs love
No naturesfury you're not being dumb.
I'm listening
:)
Hi, Good morning everyone
same here
Hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
hi
Rarity is best pony
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
hai TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
rarity is second best mule :)
Now how is he gonna fit the mane in?
DudeFromMinnesota na during FRIDAY movie night. when jessica 1st came out. wrek had a lil insperation moment
/me pets naturesfury
*hugs Wrek*
DudeFromMinnesota: with the magic of layers
Its okay, your not dumb naturesfury
naturesfury what the gravy soaked cheese covered hell are you talking about?
Sumica earlier said twilight cross with jess. jbut a rarity cross makes more sense
DudeFromMinnesota: who framed roger rabbit
is a movie
Im in love with Rarity
I like her greed ^^
Rarity is hotter than Jessica
Rex_Mundi: just like spike
Rex_Mundi: I like her songs best ^-^
what i like about rarity is that she'S so woidnerfully flawed
Fleur de Lis was better than Rarity
wht is this shitty music
Rarity is sexiest pony
^nope
she's greedy but tries not to. and fails every so often :D
Rarity is hot indeed
/me kicks DerpyMuffins
wipergone2 Complaining when wrek is streaming? tsk tsk that's not good for your health
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Sombra's Revenge / Apple Family Float / Art of the Match / Orange you Glad / You've Done it Twi
But her personality is her best trait, like all the mane6
I believe it's buck DoctoDoctorWho
a big, dazzling diamond :3
would it be worth it to by Heartfire or Dawnguard with Skyrim?
killerpony7733: wht helth
Complaining about the music? That's a paddlin'
killerpony7733: health*
Mexican death metal ftw!
mexicans only make peruan flute music
wipergone2: if it does not match your taste, you are invited to shut it and step out
^
Disrespecting the guy who's streaming? That's another paddlin'
Sombrero likes mexican metal
never heard it, YokusaHHart
DerpyMuffins: For pony biology that would be correct but as far as the slang for the word has evolved it would be really awkward.
Indeed
Rarity isn't sexist pony
Maybe best whore
And ponies can still kick I think
But that's about it
She's only a whore in the fanfics
stahp dahpi!
I will eat you.
You should read Like Fine Wine
Everyone
every Rarity fan
Insultin mah ponies, tsk tsk
Rarity is sexy pone
I get a homosexuality vibe from Rarity
awwww shit son /me takes out lighter
/me takes out lighter
wat
DerpyMuffins: Oh now ya fucked up!
Let's face it, Rarity is more into mares than RD is
wisdom of the day: raubtier is german for predator
This ould be Celestia...
still don't understand anything
*coud
What was Fancypants doing in Ponyville? Rarity.
DerpyMuffins: and you draw that conclusion hoooow exactly?
DerpyMuffins: wait, I see what your doing...
ah
she be trollin
05how can you call this shitty?
What am I doing exactly DoctoDoctorWho
of course
but even trolling needs grounds
Who said it was shitty?
Who said this was shitty?
^
05wipergone2
ya who called this shitty?
Get him!
my guess? bieber fan
wipergone2: :|
DudeFromMinnesota: I dislike the Fancypants/Rarity ship (Rarepants?), I think he is too old for Rarity and is too minor a character. I friendship those two.
mmkay.
Dark_Horst: u calling me bieber fan?
Ya they are best rich friends, :P
Rex_Mundi: sides, he'S already getting golddigged by fleur
wipergone2: i did
Fleur = Trophy wife
Dark_Horst: yeah... also, Fleur is nice
If you guys haven't notice, mares outnumber stallions in Equestria
^
Dark_Horst: fail troll is fail
Fleur = One dimensional dumbass.
fleur is expendable
Wait...are these guys German or Scandinavian?
wipergone2: troll? you came in and complained about the music. thatw as a conclusion
The population is like, 80% female
Fleur is a harlot, nothing more
wipergone2: also, i dont think you know what a troll is
DoctoDoctorWho: and mostly nude
DaringDerpy: -.(\
Dark_Horst: i do
Daring DoctoDoctorWho /)
I like Fleur
naturesfury: hm?
DoctoDoctorWho: remmember season one? clestia'S lust dungeon was a widepsread theory back then
Are these guys German or Scandinavian? I'm so confused.
swedish
Incans
Wrek is swedish
I'm like the only Non-Scandinavian in my state.
Oh so as a Swede he probably wouldn't have gotten my Simpsons reference then?
I'm Scandinavian too
DaringDerpy: The interesting thing about equestria is that I view it as what the world may be like if and sorry for the religion ref here, eve never bit off the tree. They make clothes for purpose and for occasion, but otherwise dont have problems with nudity.
DudeFromMinnesota: i'm pretty sure that show is everywhere
She needs a long tail. I rather like long tails.
I bet you do
I really liker her tail
like
DoctoDoctorWho: they have winter fur. humans don't.
I really like her ho-OH GOD THERES BLOOD EVERYWHERE!
and that is why fluttershy
Sup dudes, what we watching?
Fluttertree
Socks: wrek be drawing
Hai Socks
a unicorn
HELP ME!
OC pony-unicorn-mare do well
DudeFromMinnesota: try cleenex
I CAN SEE MY SMALL INTESTINE!
Diamond_Tiara_2012: It might be rarity
Hell, it could possible be Celestia.
anything I can do to hekp?
help
Wow, I just brought 6 games on steam
CALL 911!
DaringDerpy: The ponies in show dont grow winter coats, and its just like with human society. If there is no nudity taboo, we will make clothes for a purpose.
nothing more
Edible boots
we normally dont wear clothes
DoctoDoctorWho: status symbols
milieu symbols
Nudity isn't taboo in Equestria
Because clothes are pretty, duh
At first when Sweetie Belle said that I thought she said "edible boobs"
Things got awkward
that sounds very disturbing
DaringDerpy: there are many different reasons, but the need to be clothed at all times is null and void.
Clothes are a luxury in Equestria
Only rich ponies wear clothes
^
Edible boobs
DoctoDoctorWho: it solves a few problems society still hasn't worked out otherwise. the whole sexual stuff
It's teats
I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits
All boobs are edible, it's just that few people like canabalism
Ponies don't have 'boobs'
DaringDerpy: Exactly! Im beggining to think we are both on the same side of the arguement here,
I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits
05oo this is a good song
Hi :P
Hai Ditzy
hi
/me hugs Ditzy
DoctoDoctorWho: probably
i think i know that one
I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits
oh and i notice he now has songtitles on display
sweet
^
Where Muffins
Actually, its only ponyville that is nude all the time, all the ponies in other towns all wear clothes
I want burnt juice
Rex_Mundi: cloudsdale
Rex_Mundi: not really
Brains
pony brains
there'S quite a bunch of unclothed ponies in canterlot
Rex_Mundi: Generally just hats
Rex_Mundi: that western town
ZomBEEZ
and almost no crystal pony had clothing
Grape juice
right
dunno about manehatten, i think that was an equal spread
Rex_Mundi: Oh yeah, AAAAAAAAPLEOOSA!
makes sense, it being a metropolis and all
now that I think about it, Fleur was the only female canterlot citizen without hat. how naughty!
Crystal ponies aren't actually made of crystal are they?
no :|
DudeFromMinnesota: they are if you ask the crystal heart
It makes sense only the rich having clothes, have you ever seen a second hand clothes shop in equestria?
FUN
MUFFIN WHERE MUFFIN :(
FUN
DudeFromMinnesota: Nay, its only a magic effect that makes them sparkly that wears off.
FUN FUN FUN FUN
FUN
there is no poverty in equestria. probably an oil sheikdom
I like muffin
DaringDerpy: haha, oh theres poverty alright.
No Celestia just kills all the homeless
Hai Derpy_Hooves
DudeFromMinnesota: :D
Rex_Mundi: it wears off after they leave the empire boundaries
hi
I swear there is like 6 derpys here
turns them into stone
we never get to know if it doesnt stay intac in the crystal city
All the derp :P
Tom
Sorry.
what is sorry in Swedish?
I find the 'Clip clop' sound the ponies hooves make to be super adorable.
resistance is futile. you will be derpified
I WANT A FLUGELHORN!
like that?
The DerpBorg, I smell fanfic!
I want cake
/me scribbles
DudeFromMinnesota: then she stuffs their bodies into her tlailaxu meat tank and forms new pretty mares out of the raw material
Demaa
*steals socks*
I find pony squees to be overrated
Its kind of their shtick to be crystally, so I assume it doesnt wear off unless the crystal heart is compromised, wherever they are
at least that'S my theory about the high mare to stallion ratio
Veggie salad
/me squees like a little girl when ponies do something cute :3
*fleischsalat
....
meat salad?
Really?
squee
Maybe its like G1, the boy ponies are off on a race around the worlds
The squees are like the wilhelm scream, overated and overused, but I love it anyway :)
Dark_Horst: Or you know, they just have a high female birth rate, that too
Or half of the mares are actually drag queens.
DoctoDoctorWho: with celestia? nope
actually guys
DudeFromMinnesota: really
Like Bon Bon and Lyra
actually drag queens
DaringDerpy + ponies http://i.imgur.com/nnHjE.jpg
actually drag Changlings
and I'm back Bronystate from working on a test :D
all the males are in the military. must be a young agg draft in equestria

How is it possible to be a drag queen with no clothes 6.9
There were soooo many Lyras and Bonbons in the crowd last episode

naturesfury: you serve your time, then your out. Unless your talent is the gaurd
I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits

Rex_Mundi: those are called geldings
Everyone sing with me
I would like some milk from the milkmans wfies tits
wifes*
I honestly think the Equestrian gaurd is just a formality, and they have a real functional military in reserve
dinner time in europe
i actually dont know that song
DoctoDoctorWho: I want to see their battle mages
Milkman by Aphex Twin
seeing how ponies know trenches, camouflasge and tanks, that is a valid theory
Tanks? WHen did this happen?
they have machine guns
when did they have a tank?
And bullets
is Wrek drawing Slenderpony?
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353836450505.png have some feels
they talked about tanks twice
Tank the turtle?
Socks: mentioned in rarities song art of the dress. also, RDs pet tortoise is named tank
Ahem, "He'll need to go fast as a bullet to keep up with me!"
Bronysith: :(
Emergency Edible Boots. Discuss
Bronysith: Oh. Them feels.
They mention the word tank, not acctual tanks
What is he drawing?
Gasoline: we arnt compleatly sure yet
A white horse?
Okay
NO WAY :O
Socks: well, she was careful to design a dress that wouldn make rainbows flank look like a tank
NullRadix: You mean you don't have those, what happens if your out walking and you get hungry?
seems to be a horse
i'm pretty sure they were talking about the war machines
maybe a goat
I has money on SlenderPony
not sure yet
My little gelding, castration is magic
horse pun
Nothing else would make sense in context
o ya
Dark_Horst: But the word tank could mean somthing different in equestr... hell what am I doing, ponies driving tanks would be awesome :D. This is now canon!
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353860020315.png
what are the shows for next week any1 know?
dafuq?
Canon, Tank :P
How long you been on 4chan Bronysith
If AJ has a pickup truck, than Equestria can have tanks
I'd like to know it too. Who won the lottery?
Rex_Mundi: where?
cinderella(1997)
i remember that one
thx
is b movie
Cars are cannon now
And Air Force One is A movie I think
canon
DoctoDoctorWho: Toys only, her truck has a cardbord cutout of Twilight in the back.
Ah
Bronysith: saved!
Cars are cannon, in mad max.
pretty sure aj still has an old CM-8 "big apple" MBT in her cellar
she seesm the type
right next to her truck
Just found a huge pin in my bed O.O
wat ya drawin?
so far its a unicorn
Dat1FuglyMuffin: thx

DaringDerpy: Np
Socks: someone wants you dead

Bronysith: its bad....
As in posting?
Dark_Horst: Its similar, but no
Socks: rules don't apply when you get away with breaking them
:D
DoctoDoctorWho: give me a top screenshot and i find you the right one
:)
Dark_Horst: Its model was never specified, but this is an altrenate history pic, so panzers dont exist
This is why I love nerds, you find out people are obsessed with the most wonderful things :)
Note, tanks are larger than they appear

DoctoDoctorWho: this one seems to do
DoctoDoctorWho: also, if remember correctly, the whole bunch had a distinct german vibe to it. alone from the names
DaringDerpy: Amestris was distinctly resemblent of the third reich, but better and cooler.
the uniform in the pic looks like an ss coat
DaringDerpy: might be worth a look
DoctoDoctorWho:

French
SpeccyRush: I get on with Wrek. For now.
it dont work on quakenet thingy..
I don't think so DaringDerpy
this song fits so well to the last jappleack comic lol
There's an ad saying I could earn 300 an hour working for google, legit or no?
No
legit like the free candy van
didnt think so
THE FREE CANDY VAN IS REAL.

300 an hour is like earning as much as what low league footy players earn
DerpyMuffins: hm...

Bye guys
Cya DoctoDoctorWho
cachi01: A cat mabye?
Cya DoctoDoctorWho
Serenity: i bet it was dinkleberg
Dinkleberg is the blame for everything
"St-Pierre and Miquelon is not a part of the EU customs territory. The EU has a customs agreement with the PTOMA overseas territories, of which St-Pierre and Miquelon are part. The regulations and duties applied in St-Pierre and Miquelon are not the same as those applied in the EU. For one thing, there is no VAT."
ptoma?
meh
Actually, the reason for this whole problem is fried chicken bitch watermelon
A.K.A dinkleberg

DerpyMuffins: Mine's mostly filler. It's utterly shite this year.
GilDash atleast you past the 50k mark

joker4383: a mixture of stupidity and people who cant grow up
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whl91kKmu5w
DerpyMuffins: I always manage the 50k. I just feel inadequate about going as high as even 100k.
people thinks thats called trolling?
Pffff
DerpyMuffins: Oh, and don't think I've forgotten you story. It's on my really long to-do list.

Paper: where you from?
Mexico
DerpyMuffins: I manage no more then 1500 per hour and I've only managed 2 hours per day this month. :S
ah, i'm mexican too :3
GilDash it's good to pace yourself
DerpyMuffins: You realise 4 hours a day is the equivalent to half a day job, right?
but i live in the states
atm
H.M.S. Rainbow Dash has achieved orbit!
GilDash good thing I don't have one yet
Kipkat07_USAF: KSP?

DerpyMuffins: I still want to know how you manage more than 2k words in an hour. :S
I think we all think that the timer on the carousel was a bomb
GilDash easy, get in the mood to write
DerpyMuffins: I can't physically type that fast.
H.M.S. Rainbow Dash is reentering Kerban atmosphere

Hai Sonny
i see we are watching...a black screen...
hi DerpyMuffins ^^
DerpyMuffins: Do you touch type and use all your fingers by chance?
GilDash: yes I do, it helps a lot
DerpyMuffins: Yeah, I can barely touch type and I use perhaps two fingers on each hand.
http://derpy.me/uxsTM cool O.o
GilDash that might explain a few things
DerpyMuffins: Perhaps I should learn to type properly?
GilDash: nah it's overrated anyways
typin sux
DerpyMuffins: +170k words says othewise. :p
GilDash: do you honestly want to be typing that much though?
DerpyMuffins: What I'm typing is shit anyway, so I might as well type a lot of it.
What else is new, GilDash :p

Wrek: hi
Juess what i learned? In a G1 tie-in comic book, the origins of he baby ponies are explained. There were created by a pony looking into a magic mirror that creates a baby version of the pony. So that explains why there is a character called "lickity Split" and a seperate character named "baby lickity split" who looks exactly like Lickity split, but a baby.
No kick yet?
Pardon my language. But seriously, if you're gonna do that, go to fucking /mlp/
Someone get me the shotgun >:I
MAY I AY I WANT TAT BOOK IN THE CORNER THAT READS "Cupcakez" ON THE LABEL

Rex_Mundi: Huh, guess that explains the s3 ep
LadyCanary: Are none of the other mods on?

Thank you Shizuka <3
Thank ye kindly.
BRB I WANNA TAKE A MLP PERSONALITY QUIZ
Socks: but you still are negated into growing veggies :P
DoctoDoctorWho: Its explains something about G1 that the show doesnt, if you diddnt know about the comic, then your just supposed to except the fact that some of the ponies seem to clones or something
Alright alright.
ah :c
Facebook memes are the best aren't they?
Socks: I'm kidding of course :D
/me facedesks.
thats where all the personality quizzes are.

Pfffft. Facebook. Nobody cares about Facebook anymore

DoctoDoctorWho: Hmmm... I dont think so...
UNBELIEVEABLE RETEST
MadSurge: But soon...
Socks: SOON

Prince_Lightstar: Stop allcapsing. It doesnt make you cool. Makes you look like an attention seeker.
Prince_Lightstar, What's with the Canterlock?
Wrek is still drawing unicorn?
Rex_Mundi: They cant have both thought of the same exact concept
Yes, Socks?
05love this song

LadyCanary: I AM AN ATTENTION SEEKER
Yeah I kinda have a problem with all capsing ._.
I thought ALLCAPS was against the rules too...
Socks: I love these race banters, should write them down :D
Wrek should draw a pegasus :3c
also Civ5+GOTY+DLC 75% off
DoctoDoctorWho: Sure they can. The mirror pool doesnt give you a baby version of yourself anyways.
MadSurge: Deffinitely :P
Prince_Lightstar: I AM A DISRESPECTFUL ASSHOLE
What is this song, Wreky?

Maybe its Rarity?
idk why
I think judge doom was scarier than g3 pinkie
its a case of we havent replaced the shingles in 15+ years and the rain water has gotten through a few places, making those spots a bit rotten - only one spot, around the edge of a skylight, has mold, luckily over a room we dont use, blocked off now til the roof is repaired
Ahh, I see what's going on now.
g4 pinkie made g2 face
You guys are good... Too good I'm bored bye :P
i want to press the button :'(
How many of us here are females?
i wish there was a button >:
G3 Pinkie Pie was sickeningly stupid, but judge doom was a fricken Psycopath.

We repainted my bedroom this weekend. It looks great :3c

Rex_Mundi: u mean like ur hat
So Prince_Lightstar is the young one here?
GilDash: G.I.R.L., Guy In Real Life
DoctoDoctorWho: :D

http://i.imgur.com/ZYhVgh.jpg <probably the closest thing we have to a regs picture, despite the fact that its mostly mods
Rex_Mundi: it is amazing how very suggestive that sounded B)
/me doesn't even know what Black Lagoon is
05lets see if this wokr
05s
Yes lets :)
Sorry
This may sound weird, but the title Black Lagoon reminds me of what the book series "X from the Black Lagoon".
excited
Dark_Horst: Haha... :)
<3
Dat Intro
Very stuttery?
WAIT.
Bang.
Now I remember this. I saw a trailer for this from Funimation.
Dis intro...
DAT
SONG
what are the chances that one day someone stream hellsing ? also what anime is dis ?
This show is about schoolgirls and magic and demons and stuff right?
Don't people say that this is the modern equivalent of Cowboy Bebop?
Black Lagoon
Rex_Mundi: Not even close
Vordox: But its anime!
Rated E for everyone.
Rex_Mundi: Then you're too shallow to go deeper into what kind of Medium is Anime
oh shit it's sunday
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD!?
oh cowboy bebop?
Rex_Mundi: You'll see what this is
No haseo348. Black Lagoon.
Vordox: I know what this is! :D
whoops.. looked like it...
Wrek: I'm not sure if I should compliment people for thinking this is Cowboy Bebop quality, or scold them...
05the animation sure is but sory wise... eh i jsut enjoy it for what it is
05compairign it to otehr animes ruins it
05t*
I've heard people say that this is the modern equivalent to Cowboy Bebop in terms of acclaim. Would they be correct?
05i wouldnt know
Wrek: Yeah that's the feeling I have, but.. You got to admit one thing, this MAY be the "Cowboy Bebop" of the modern times. <.<
Wrek, have you ever seen Death note?
05Malmortius: Sumica is the amine guy here
That would be the best streaming anime, wrek. DEATH NOTE!
Who hasnt seen Death note?
oh
Ew.
why does it say Wrek at the bottom
Malmortius: Too much talk to be streamed
I wanna see Roberta :(
Wrek produced this anime
05i basicalyl havent seen anything anime besides the few sumi has streamed
Malmortius: Because Wrek's streaming.
MadSurge: cause he'S streaming
05and this one
Overplayed and overrated. Black Lagoon please.
Wrek: So this is your anime virginity for streaming? :P
Ok then Rozen Maiden
Malmortius: Wrek is also an animater on MLP FIM, its why he draws so many ponies.
Dark_Horst: tab fail :D

/me nods in agreement to AdamTheDuck
AGreed, AdamTheDuck.
Hey I got an idea..

How about we shut the fuck up about Cowby Bebop?
I kinda wish that Wrek was an animater for MLP FIM, that would be interesting
so whats Black Lagoon about?
and talk about G >.SAK?
Yep, Zawan.
This anime is interesting..
AdamTheDuck: ...howd you get a hold of those logs?

Yes.

05haseo348: becasue that would be unfair for the ocmpetition
05you see the mods have kick counters
05having the autoscript for gak on then is cheating
05;)
oh..
....dat catgirl figure.
Wrek, oh you :$
Having an autoscript on at all is cheating. :p
haseo348: because Saturadys is the streaming of episodes, last time the kaG commercial was 4 times in a row

And that's how you use a rifle
CriticKitten: Yes, that's the credits.
CriticKitten: nope just zuul
Ok... Apparently its over...
She really needs to tie those laces.

Oh, so this is where I've heard this song from.
Dark_Horst: Mind Pattern
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: PMV: Fighting for Equestria
i just got clever bot to agree to heavy BDS&M
I'm quite enjoying this, actually.
LadyCanary thats not very nice
So, are the side rooms supposed to be open?
THIS Bridge!
<3
They shouldn't be Eddmario
animebrony: To be fair, idiots having been plaguing here all day.
dem vocals
She has all the weapon
ture but... c'mon, how often do people give you guns? also, they dont make the best throwing weapons
I like how light and right sound exactly the same.
Weird, I don't recall watching this anime before, but I know I've heard the song. Hrm.
harrumph
fffffffffffffffff
Suddenly English.
cachi01: Harrumph!
lol now english :D
o.o
Aww...
HA
:D
oh thx
GilDash: idiots? Not the regulars I hope :D
Ok... Enflish I'm cool with this...
Apparently the side rooms are open, even though they're not supposed to be.
And then magically Japanese?
Eddmario: They are not
CriticKitten: :D
05didnt remember that its beign silly having eng audio as nr 1
MadSurge: Nah, looks like newbies.
Oh, apparently dubs arent good enough!
GilDash: thought so
Socks: Very few are
But I dont like to read!
silly english
<--- Mangrove Heaven, eh
MadSurge: Bringing their 4chan ways here. Tsk, tsk...
Vordox: Well they are for me.
Wrek: if the english dub is passable, why dont we just use that one`? easier to follow chat
Eddmario: No they are not, you can't join them :P
Vordox: But then a lot of them are just as good, depends on anime really.
Splash.
what she said!
Vordox: And some are better!
>he's pissy because his life is ruined
Dark_Horst: cause japanese is better
Hey YO wuts up everypony:)
Vordox: then why can I join em?
Hi, scout19_tf2. :)
Is he going to end up becoming a badass in his own right?
>she's like "that gun is expensive, bitch, get over it"
hi scout19_tf2 :)
Hai scout19_tf2 :)
Hello scout19_tf2
Eddmario: Refresh Bronystate
Besides, with dub I can chat and watch at the same time.
Try again to join it
GilDash: we all know you're the king of sauciness here ;)
that's an ugly shirt
Vordox: I did. It's still opened and automatically put me in it.
Hi scout19_tf2 :)
how've you been scout19_tf2
MadSurge: I can be... depending on what I think I can get away with. ;)
Eddmario: Using a special Irc?
MadSurge and GilDash: :D
I like her a lot already. No whiny boy-teen drama while she's around. Now we need to strategically place characters like her into every Final Fantasy game....
Vordox: Not that I know of..
a special IRC
alexxm: ive been good:$ just bought another mlp shirt
or a "special SCP?"
scout19_tf2: Nice! :)
Rose`: Which SCP?
So, I heard you guys got hacked yesterday...
AJIsAwesome: GilDash and I met at BUCK :3c
MadSurge: Nice. :O
Eddmario: So you're the one?
05801-J
did that board cannon use a battlefield firing sound?
:P
i know i hearrd that before
La Style~ :D
0,5J-108
AJIsAwesome: Yes, you should try and come this year if you can.
Vordox: No, just seeing if a rumor is true or not
Eddmario: The day before actually, no biggie.
Eddmario: you tell me http://imgur.com/M20Ff
Eddmario: They did get hacked on Friday by GNAA
The Bronystate PR department does not sustain any rumors of a hack, thank you for your concern
GilDash: It depends. I'll try my hardest to.
AJIsAwesome: GilDash dons awesome hawaiian shirts!
MadSurge: :D
"hack"
how have u been alexxm
cachi01: O_o
according to the mods it wasnt a hack
hafta?
05there was no hack
some dipshit simply god his hands on the streaming key
hijack
i'm good scout19_tf2
05jsut a simple hijack due to mips not hiding its stream keys
AJIsAwesome, MadSurge: Yes, I am the one in the hawaiian shirt. I shall try again this year. ^_^
The mods are just trying to deny it
The PR department has spoken, There was no 'hack'
Bronystate wasn't hacked. Only the stream was.
... =__=
05this "hijack" has happened many times before we use it when we switch streamers
hack nope. just hijacked
People don't understand what "hack" means. >_>
05not even the stream was hacked
Wrek: im guessing that'S why i havent seen mips in the window since then?
Either way, we were invaded
GilDash: I'll try to be there again :)
05yes
Well, it's hardly a hack.
So, did one of the mods forget to close one of the side rooms?
Hijacked, my friends. Not hacked.
05calling it a hack gives the guys behind it waaaay too much credit
^
What does Hijacked mean?
But hack sounds more epic :/
It does
DinkyDoo: ttaking over
Socks: True dat.
And it wasn't all that epic, ergo they don't merit the credit
saying that was a hack was like saying youre hacking someones facebook account if they leave it open
taking*
DinkyDoo: lets say you are driving a boat and then i suddenly take it from you and i use it
Socks: but it wasn't epic:D
What Rose` said.
nice poster
DinkyDoo: taken controll of
Rose`: lol
Crissy and Sarah aaah yeah :D
can we get a clearer view of the pin up poster
Oh, and by the way some boobs in the background, just to remind you this is an anime.
DinkyDoo: I would say hijack is taking control, and hacking a complete override with no solution to the problem.
Punch.
*taking control for a set time period
SOmetimes it's nice to laugh at the iggnorant trolls :D
Oh..
DinkyDoo: If I hijacked a vehicle, I killed/incapacitated everyone on it and took controll
*ignorant FTW :D
DoctoDoctorWho, you don't have to kill them to hijack the vehicle
05they didnt even do that
05its like this
05im driving
<---- Rock is one of my favourites due to a reason you'l see soon
05adn they tried to grab the steering wheel
AdamTheDuck: I said or incapacitate
05and we pucnhed them
05and continued driving
Like in GTA?
^
Hacking requires skill
Gasoline: yep
Wrek: Don't you try grab my steering wheel. It won't end well. XD
Black Lagoon?
Socks: but no sill was used
GilDash: :D
But Wrek, in your case, you could use your axe :3

since they saw him as a god
Get down on your knees?

Daygon: Black Lagoon

:|
Metronome: no vidoe links while a stream is active soo aka not now
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Blast from the Past #15
cigars everywhere
What if, It's not a video link but it links to youtube?
bang
Metronome: If it links to YouTube it's a video link.
Metronome: NON-IMAGE links are not allowed
05no non image links during streams
Its kindaearly to speculate on the quality of season 3 after the opener and 1 episode. Remember the fit people threw when Cadance first came up ? Turns out shesan awesome throing implement.
It's still not a non-image link.
Learn to follow da rules.
Metronome: Anything except for an image is prohibited when a stream is on.
Metronome: NON-IMAGE that means everything thats not an image is not allowed
<--- Someone's been busy
Why are we arguing about this still >_>
Metronome: it also leads to video scren that reads video no available, so it's clearly a video linl
It's SO simple.

Meulin: Inb4 you know that Hussie is an Anime fan
complete with anty chopper torpedoes lol
OH WOOPS
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Too main stream? what do you mean
Forgot that part:P
there's nothing wrong with anime... i just wish this wasn't the only thing on this website
k
Meulin: Only thing..?
You must be new
well, whenever the mods stream sci fi you just start complaining again
hm
Meulin: ikr
Has John Fitzgerald Kennedy appeared in this anime yet?
but i have a bad attention span... something has to be REALLY interesting for me to stay...
051: im not an anime fan 2: dont complain while i am here, its bad for you. 3: you complain no matter what we stream whether its me streamign olde cartoons, sumi with anime or me and shizu with sci fi
Meulin: it isnt
Mods stream pretty much anything
05and dont get me started on when we show gaming
05peopel cant get their asses out when that happends
WOO ROBERTA
...is this place going 24/7?
Tyr: been waiting eh? :P
Is this anime worth watching....... the only anime on hear that actually semmed interesting was "the Boondocks"
Meulin: Of course not
i love this arc
http://i.imgur.com/I7kfw.jpg
Which was hillarious
well both Roberta centric arcs
Wrek: if u dislike it why r u showing it
LOL
Actually, what I think would be great, is if we streamed streams of snowboard resorts, and watched all the people wiping out every now and then. |D
05scout19_tf2: didnt say i dislike it either
05also
sigh
00,10hmmm ping?
05ever since i got back to streamign we keep it pretty much 24/7 with soem exceptions
/me complains about the amount of complaining\
Wrek: It's bad for your health. :(
Ohai scout19_tf2 :3 I had fun today
Ah Roberta <3
but if you keep it going 24/7 then doesn't it get boring...?
Must...cosplay...
<--- Tabitha St Germaine is that girls VA in English, go find it elsewhere. :P
sigh
05Meulin: nope, because the content is so varied
best part about anime
05had it been 24/7 of ponies
13wreeeeeeek you promised you would finish vivi's maaaane
Meulin: Making the same comic for over 1400 series must be boring too?
05liek some want it to be
Meulin: You need to think bigger, longer, better. :P
05this site would be so boring id kill people
they never mention that people walk around in weirdo outfits
I used to like Anime more...
05Shizuka: oh fu-
HoodyNinja: awsome:) wud u do
Meulin: Find the better anime then
I've seen a lot of freaking anime
05with that settled
Meulin: There's plenty of in the pool that's increasing, just find the good ones when digging and stop letting other people bend you into things you may not like
scout19_tf2: I played tf2 wif you ;~;
Meulin: gurren lagann?
Meulin: Tell me when you have over 18 years of Anime behind your back =P
05Meulin: time to stop complaining about oru content just casue its not to your liking
I'm a tumblr pony and that is how it shall always be
speaking of which, Vordox, have you seen scoffette?
hmph
Rose`: Sadly not
Meulin: and this has to do with what?
Wait, who the hell is complainin?
HoodyNinja: u did:) wut server

Just AFKed TL;DR^ Wht's going on
./)_-

Meulin: You go into someone's house and complain about their things
Meulin: I'm sorry, but that's just plain rude.
we are all searching for scoffette, Metronome
052 can play the obnoxious game
Meulin: Also you need to learn whining/Complaining/Criticizing/Feedback
HoodyNinja: well i ushually go on jegion of ponies

Wrek: is that your personal kill score?
fuck all of you and your crappy streaming and even crappier modding. No wonder this website doesn't have more popularity, the only good thing about it is the Saturday streams. Other than that, this place is nothing but a cesspool of whiny and annoying idiots. Bye.

BULLETS MADE OF FRIENDSHIP AND TOLERANCE

HoodyNinja: were u on ma team:)
Wrek: Don't you have anything to do today? It's already past 2 am. :P

WHOA
Oh shit
Jeez the PHRASEOLOGY of the woman
WTF
:O
This is CRAZY........
yeah
better than the other way round
Anime is awesome because it is easily made, highly entertaining, and it goes forever. Pokemon is at over 700 episodes now, i think.
KrazyNoobs: Easily made
ROFL
KrazyNoobs, uhh, I hate those animes that last forever
80 episodes per year with Pokemon? Has to have been easily made.
05>easely made
05>red lien took 7 years to make
05riiiight
Wrek: I already laughed at him. :P
They start out good, but they get crappy. Like Pokemon! I love Pokemon when it is old, but new Pokemon sucks.
all it wud take is one bullet, ONE BULLET:[
She can shoot while driving
hey everypony :) back
Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
Welcome back, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)
Roberta > Terminator
Some animes with huge amounts of special effects, such as this one, would be hard. As stated by me before, Pokemon is easily made. 80 episodes per year, which does diminish its quality.
/me glomps Sketch_Toku_Brony
heller Sketch_Toku_Brony:)
HERE IT IS
THE SCENE
where did she got that?
.........
...
/me glomps HoodyNinja
Those weapons. WANT PLS
they totally did not just reference terminator
Ow ;~;
Why you glomp me
hmmmmmmm
they'Vebeen referencing it all episide
Hello Sketch_Toku_Brony
Cus I like you.
Its me Justin lawl
05this is jsut gettign goood
ONE BULLET:[ :[ :[
Roberta is Best maid
IKR
scout19_tf2: This isn't TF2
she goes abosultely BONKERS in the secodn season
The less episode per year, the more time to work on an episode, and the better quality it will be, as demonstrated by Season 3 Episode 3 of MLP:FiM. Ep 1, 2 sucked, and 4 didn't meet my expectations. Season 3 has 9 episodes to redeem itself.
KrazyNoobs: LAWL
....
Vordox: :P wut
KrazyNoobs: Boy, go back and read up on anime from the beginning. please
/me facedesks.
I was talking about ponies. I moved on from anime.
dUDE.
The new season just started.
KrazyNoobs: Yeah but you talk about things you don't know, AND you say you KNOW how they work and everything
Dont judge just from the first few episodes. Shut it.
What do you mean by that?
05shh
KrazyNoobs: Go create your own ponies if you're disatisfied, everyone else does.
05maid is beign badass
05focus on that
LadyCanary: you could be more polite you know
KILL HER:[
I love ponies, I have no idea why you are saying I hate them.
I hope the next Episode doesnt suck:'(:'(
./)_-
WHO SES DEY HATE PONIES :[
05wat
I love every episode, some just don't meet my expectations. I enjoy all of them
05just
KrazyNoobs: Create...your...OWN.
KrazyNoobs: so what is it precisely that made the pilot suck, hm?
05<Vordox> KrazyNoobs: Go create your own ponies if you're disatisfied, everyone else does.
05he didnt say that you hate them dude
05as for this discussion
05drop it already
05jeez
05jsut enjoy the show isntead of arguing over the new episodes quality
05they are jsut fine
/me 08,01licks Wrek
new topic.. incoming Revy VS roberta
...
AWWWW YEA she ded
Wrek is best Mod
oh shit
WHAT
/me licks VenHur
It's clean up time.
oh wait, fail tab :$
/me licks Venus :P
I loved the new episodes, I just thought they could have been better. It was mostly the villian, I wanted to see more personality. That's it, I still thought it was an excellent episode. Why do you think I hate it? I said it didn't meet my expectations, but, for one last time, THAT DOESN'T MEAN I HATE IT.
05KrazyNoobs...
05i gave you one chance
drop it
05to drop the topic
05you didnt
Why yuu nuu stop lickin' meh?
Okay, I'll drop it.
Sorry
...I'm back!
05too late man
Welcome back VenHur :P
Wrek: da hammer
welcome back VenHur

Oh here we freaking go.

05i feel merciful today
Wrek he quit :V
Black Lagoon AND a final warning
let it drop
its da show down
05twilight_sprinkle: which is why i told them to drop it
Wrek: If you feel so merciful, then why you no attack 4Kids's HQ?
<--- HOW CAN THEY MISS
Vordox: not really aiming
because in anime, if your not OP, your UP
Vordox: pointing a gun at someone(ESPECIALLY AKIMBO) at night anf firing is NOT aiming
*youre and *youre
Rose`: You're wathing the wrong animes then :P
so much death
they dont miss , theyshoot each others bullets out of the air
Hooo. o_o
Wrek: i know im just saying i can see how it would be hard to drop something after being treated rudely for no reason, didnt want him to get banned for it
hiya LadyCanary

CCCP, would you like to re-read what you just wrote?
i'll give you a few minutes.
CCCP: if not from a moral standpoint, from a breeding standpoint it causes more problems from conception than not.
I need to find my Tank Police series - havent watched that in ages
aaaand this chat is going in an awkward direction
Rose otakon it has been almost disproven that that is not true.
otakon: Not to be WITh it, but if it's safe sex? =P
CCCP: back up your points
SHOW US THE STATS
CCCP, have you SEEN some of the people on the british isles?
CCCP: bullcrap, that's why "pure" breed dogs have so many health issues
Stat it up mate
tiny island = tiny breeding pool
Vordox: thats implying the bible
You know you've dun goofed when Rose` is the one chatting words of wisdom.

There will probably be a nuclear war in a few years too.
I CANT WATCH!
WHYYYYYY do they hesitate
Kurra: bc kids
Sumica: not my intention, but sure XD
and theyre still more compassionate and less annoying than jersey shore
<---- Chang is stronger then Revy and Roberta, combined
ITS RAINING MEN
Hallelujah
I love the lack of bloodshed in this anime
Lmao!
LadyCanary: Hallej....dammit
HoodyNinja: LACK!?
If you actually saw the twins in your house, what would you do?
otakon, these guys live to make Platoon look Children's Television Workshop. WRYYYY HESITATU
00,10the guy pulls a mini gun on a warewolf and turns it to paste
otakon: maid girl shoots up a bar- no blood
HoodyNinja: and lack of tits,could definitely use some more of that
DinkyDoo: fucking run like a little bitch
offer them hot pockets
00,10DM says nope still not dead cause it has to be silver bullets
Kurra: still
HoodyNinja: you mustve missed the scene where they were bathing in blood
indeed, I guess
Sumica: oh bullshit! paste is PASTE
twilight_sprinkle: I saw that, but people don't bleed when they're shot
I would ask to join them just so I wouldn't die. If they say no, I RUN LIKE THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO END.
pff
not even AKMs
0,5Soooo
meow
DinkyDoo: yeah that doesn't work on insane twincest
0,5You need a whole militia for these kids?
So what if the world ends next moth?
BaconMane: they are THAT dangerous
you do
Hey, one of them has an anti tank rifle.
I herd that AKs were great to maintain, horrible for accuracy
CHANG
THIS IS SPARTA
he said duck
CCCCCCCP: At least we went out with ponies
no one moved.
NO ONE~
damn Chang knows his stuff
HoodyNinja meh
:I
How are the twins even dodging those bullets?
...GO BOSS CHANG GO
that magazine cant hold that many bullets
00,10they are like TR players
She's so cute <3
Dark_Horst: it's modified
Kurra: Extremely reliable but really heavy ammo
05^^^^^
also all those bullets would go straight theough that car
Hi Kinixys hi Cypresswolf-
Watsap?
thank you.
Watsap :D
00,10could be armored car
otakon: the only modification that would keep that machinegun firing would be hammerspace
oh okay then.
Hi CCCCCCCP !
Hello CCCCCCCP - so many C's
Dark_Horst: bah ask RX when you see him next, he's a gunsmith
dammit Eda PUT ON A TOP!
FUCKING
GODDAMMIT TOMBOT!
lel
05^ cute
that terminology
C is for CCCCCCCP, that's good enough for me - :P couldn'r resist
I saw a Honda delivered to a dealership once, wa SCARY how the 7 bullet holes or so just kept going through the car, where it was hit. Through bodywork, plastic, seats, out the other side. Through the length of the Accord....
WHAT IS THIS ANIME ABOUT
00,10you know I bet a duel grinder Max could stop them twins
HoodyNinja: guns and lots of them
It's awesome, but confusing
Cypresswolf :P
Sumica: who?
about the only thing that stops a bullet is engine + car, not just engine alone even
Sumica: We must play childrens card games with them
Kurra: phonebook armor works for most rounds
05we could jsut sweep with our lib sumi
only if you pair phonebook with a hard layer. Phonebook alone well..
Seriously WHY ARE NONE OF THESE GUYS WEARING ANY KNID OF BODY ARMOR?!
Are these twins old enough to drive?
this guy is smart
and that's NERA anyway which... well, isn't bad :)

Oh well it's netgear, otakon , the hell do you expect?
nyehs
DarkColt: good point, don't look a gift horse in the mouth I say
It's like saying you went to buy from Sony and expected it to play ripped DVDs.
lol
turns out disney world is selling mlp toys
Honestly, it pissed me off when I wanted to watch my vids on the big screen after editing and couldn't because the damn DVD player sucked so bad
pinkiebrony: O-o wut
they get sued like
ALL THE TIME
/me listens to Avast Your Ass
They have the money to get sued like that
MLP SUED THEM
I don't blame them
00,02Mutterguy
pinkiebrony: Dysney has the mean as lawyers though
Wait; isn't it Hasbro that would sue?
00,02press enter
but they get sued anyway
You're a genius Phase.
DarkColt: yesh...
they werent allowed
Hasbro's stock is rising actually; it's funny, for my Economics class I'm using Hasbro as my main stock for my project
but they get sued anyway
they werent allowed
I chose it due to season 3 coming out xD
hmm?
Hmm.. maybe should buy some hasbro stock.
Wouldn't be a bad idea; though it may just be temp
If you're looking to buy, wait till after season 3, and between season 3 and 4, buy the stock
noes
my stream
That's when they'll probably be at their lowest, as well as after Feburary.
MY STREAM DIED!
DAMMIT!

I'll probably wait till next year to see what stocks do.

How does a pony hug?
/me twilightisbestpony
Is it physically possible?
second part is mandatory
DarkColt: with their front hoves ^_^ I'v seen it done
You know what this game needs?
Needs more sand
depends on your definition of hug i guess
DarkColt magic, ooh!, with whimsey!
Deacon: hah
: O well then
whats this game??
They got that one arm bro-hug going on
DarkColt: and ponnies don't need no physics
meeshluvderpy: Desperate Gods, google it it is free
Wait a second... if Pewdiepie was a brony... would he bro-hoof?
yeah pewdiepie rocks
depends who he's brohoofing to
oh cool
All the pewds
haha
This stream needs to do Dwarf Fortress some day
The bro army, of course!
so when are the pony streams here
Pewdiepie can go burn in a ditch.
(Que Nostalgia Critic 'of course'...)
:C Why do you say that?
meeshluvderpy: two eps on friday/saturday, and the new ep on saturday
He only sees his viewers as money and he is annoying.
SpadeMagnes[R heh up until the 1st round of goblins..
all day saturday or certain time
meeshluvderpy you mean when ponies are streamed? well it's mostly on special occasions here, like new episodes
Dwarf Fortress, where losing is fun!
ok cool but is the episode played only once during air time or throughout the day never been in a stream to be able to discuss the episode and looking for the right place to do that
M'kay, well, it's late; nice chatting with you all! :3
Toodles.
Peace~
bye DarkColt

so are there different rooms here i thought i saw some different sections
GabeMoist: Desperate Gods
meeshluvderpy: the stream is the same in all rooms
as well as the chat?
no, the chat is different. don't know if the side rooms are even open now. usually only during live episodes.
But outside of episodes, only the main chat is used.
no stream:'(
scout19_tf2, there should be one, try refreshing

but looking into doing youtube shorts in the future
AdamTheDuck: I told you guys the bank of Allegr0 was still up and running
oh it was? :D
AdamTheDuck: your Allegr0 dollars are safe :)

Stallion_of_War, keep dreaming
ohai alligru
Maybe we can befriend the buffer
I've never seen this game before, have no idea whats going on.
Allegr0, go befriend buffer
It's so nice to wacth people play a board game I don't know how to play.
watch*
Is it wrong for me to find this game kinda boring?
GabeMoist: trust me...with the internet connection my university's been shitting out...the buffer's been my friend a lot lately
It'd probably be more intersting if you knew, anything, about it...
From my standpoint right now, it doesnt look that interesting
/me I'ma use my power of cuttin' things in half, with my axe.
inb4 Allegr0's OC is has a buffer ring for a cutie mark
Just downloaded the rar. It's a free game. It has a howtoplay text file attached
/me and summon funnel cakes
has*
AdamTheDuck: oh god no...
:$
in tech news though, I did buy a new mobo during black friday :D
Allegr0, certainly your university's internet isn't worse than my university's internet
AdamTheDuck: But is it animated?
I...have absolouty no idea how this is played
I thought MTG was bad
I wish A Game of Thrones was on Netflix streaming...
Triple_Aught: it's easy to roll the thingies and flip cards and move them about a bit
The first one to give Shizuka all their stuff wins?
Triple_Aught: the winner is the one who lookes like they know what they're doing
Heck, it's been years since i've seen D&D played on a board
this is a whole new element
/me licks otakon

y'all are weird :P
AFLAC
I need to find a game of something, if just for the fact that I can play the "Fallen fate" character idea I have.
space ducks?
Apparently ducks have tongues too.
FFS I WANT A SCYTHE
Ducks can sing good opera
QUACK
moo!
/me doesn't see any D20s
Nopony else knows of Critical Hit/Major Spoilers podcast?
Isn't it kinda redundant to play a board game on a computer? I mean, I thought the whole idea of an RPG is to enhance the reality instead of...well...this.
Reality for those who don't exist in the same relative demension in time/space
Moo, I'm a horse :3
/me is war
moo moomoo mooooo moo AdamTheDuck
I'm a space station ^_^

/me throws a rock at Phase4 then
DeathStar: GO back twenty years
There's a lot of British people in star wars yes? Jedi Master Tennant and Master Cumberbatch?
Triple_Aught: okeys ^_^ at least I won't have to worry about running into my past self
/me slaps DeathStar around a bit with a large trout
I find it funny how David Tennant is doing the voice for the lightsaber construction driod
DeathStar: Not to worry. I was ony 10 or so back then
/me slaps Jmo around with a small whale
Whaaaaaaaaale
Triple_Aught: I was not born....
DeathStar: Ouch
given Sonic Screwdriver:Docor = Lightsaber:Jedi
*Doctor
Stallion_of_War: the sonic Screwdriver is not a weapon though
DeathStar: This will help explain things: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Wars
It's very good at opening doors
though
Triple_Aught: I apologise. it's my job to make people eather feel old or feel tall... though the tall part only works irl :3
/me is roughly 6'
/me and 21
I'm 5,1... I think... I dunno.. darn not metric units
DO YOUR JOB NOW :[
and 18 \:D/
i think i'm about 5'4" 5'5" ^_^
DeathStar: Google is your brain; metric -> imperial
x cm in inches
then /12
DeathStar: No worries. I like to dance between the late x Gen and early Y gen : )
It's about 30 cm a foot
Stallion_of_War: but I can't remember my metric size... because I only remember my imperial size from someone converting it for me...
lol Imperial size...

Hello Sketch_Toku_Brony

Sketch_Toku_Brony hello
<--- wtf is with that card? XD
Is this Triple Triad?
What is this?
How about as a random nonpartisan judge, I officially declare Shizuka the winner as streamer.
Or we could roll a dice
Yeah Shizuka is awesome.
Brohoof for Shizuka
1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 for the four players
ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony
No? Not accepting my brohoof? ok
well that actually wouldn't work as you can't roll a 1...
Did anyone miss me at all?

twilight_sprinkle, why? .-.
I'll just bring the kettle and the teapot.
AdamTheDuck: well apparently gta 4 didnt do so well on pc, and judging by that pic, itll take one monster of a pc to run it
00,10if time permits tonight I might stream some KPS
00,10presumine it runs better now
Probably jog around the mall to get my cardio up
Then get in line
Maybe snort some coke

lel u so phunny
If Disney makes SW 7 like they did Tron 2, I'll bring my Camelback full of Red Bull to stay awake for tht mess

Okay Im done
McFarlane was just a guy in the right place at the right time
I might respect the show more now...just...get rid of Meg and Stewie and make Peter actually funny.
I mean its not terrible. It's gotten a little better.
That episode where Meg is kidnapped had me laughing my ass off.
But thats just my opinion.
I still want to see Ed O'neal from Married w/Children and Peter go at it in a fistfight
These marbles look like olives <------------
Sometimes opinions are better to be kept to yourself.
What's your problem?
I have no problem.
/me pulls up a chair

Stop on by some time
We live in the rich white part of Minneapolis.
Well not rich
the middle class white part of Minneapolis
Come on over to the west coast. Ever seen a dead body full of holes?
Two cops shot last week on San Jose
I think I've smelled a dead body. I used to visit my dad in New York all the time.

SuperBrony64:
Phase4 - looks like a tax increase
Phase4:
anyone
?
Amazing how I pay an extra 30 bucks on my car registration when this state finds several million dollars for the parks.
I MADE MY APPEAL
howcome im still banned
you got a response?
?
After the4 fact of course
Yeah I agree with you there.
Phase4: It's new taxes to will go to funding education in California
But dude
MirrorImage: dose it sound like a tax increase? dose it smell like a tex increse? dose it taste like a tax increase?
Watchthat money dissappear

I prmise you
We need to balance out the landscape
00,02ah
DeathStar - only if you make >250k
we can't have all skyscrapers
from a quick google search, that's what i gather anyways
I'm not rich. Hell, I scrape together 25K a year
MirrorImage: actualy it wouldn't affect me at all... because I live in new zealand :3
until school is done
Phase4: wht game is this
bum deal bro
Wipergone2: desperate gods
can i have a go
Its not that we need to stop tax increases its that we need to stop giving taxes to DUMBASSES WHO DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEYRE DOIN!
I do four years in the service, come home in '06 from Japan, monitor effing the DPRK and Russia and shafted in taxes
nothing new
Now why the hell are people discussing politics here?
Oh you were doing service in Japan, huh?
Musta been rough :D
Cause they have nothing better to do.
Cuz it's late, i'm drunk, I'm going to get up at 0350 hrs and fight to keep a roof over my head

08,01who's playing audiosurf to shitty irish pipe music?
08,01;P
Venus, Shizu is :P

08,01sounds like an irish chanter
/me 08,01used to play the chanter
08,01sounds like a dying duck
08,01attach it to full bagpipes and it sounds like a strangled cat
or it sounds like a chinease pipe music or something
08,01sounds nothing like chinese pipes
well it does to me
Sounds sexy
08,01well, you're wrong
but not really
08,01it's a chanter
hmmm
08,01and then shizu wasn't streaming anymore
A lovely song to go to bed to

08,01well, i like Airs, which that was one of, i just dont' liek chanters
08,01even though i'm scottish
13shcottish
08,01at some point, i should stream the songs of my *other* people
08,01indian music.
00,10what a strange game bug
13dots not feathers
08,01eh?
00,10if I use launch struts on my rocket it creates too much presure in the bod of it and it pops the crew cabben off the top like a wine cork
08,01oh god, i need to pee
/me 08,01runs
13moderately distasteful joke when discussing indians to ask "dots or feathers"
Eh?
08,01oh
13dot or feather
NZ still uses the eskimos and Canada hates us for it :D
/me pokes SuperBrony64
actually I don't know anyone who call them indians outside of mentioning the game cowboys and indians
*term
Mutterguy: no we don't only for the eskimo pies P:
00,10I call them hey you, unless i know their name
and the sweets
HOW COULD YOU FORGET THE SWEETS?
it's so much fun chewing off an eskimo's head >:)
Sumica: that reminds me of this girl in my sisters year in high school. her nick name was "oi you" or "oi"
08,01so, is anyone else doing Offensive December?
offensive december?
Offensive December? .-.
08,01well, i just made it up
08,01but it's a great idea
didn't know there was such a thing.
Offensive October rolles of the tounge more
08,01it's a celebration of inappropriate comedy, throughout the month of December
08,01the object is to be as un-PC as possible
wow really
this sounds good
^
08,01i'm trying to think of some good t-shirt designs
Sounds like a bit of fun :3
13this won't end well..
Shizuka, it never does :$
08,01two i'm going to run with

08,01also, the "TEAM PALESTINE" t-shirt
that last one MIGHT be a little too far
08,01i'm trying to think of more
Specially as team Gaza is better than team palestine
08,01Chrysalis: there's no such thing as too far during Offensive December!
Venus: we need a map of the world with the sheep shaggers clearly marked XD
08,01DeathStar: now there's an idea
DeathStar so derby marked then?
So what you need is muslim/neo-nazi focus groups?
Venus: ooh ooh! or what about "jesus would love you if he existed"
08,01i could even do it just a map of the UK, marked "sheep shaggers" (highlands and wales), "pakistanis" (bradford), "dwarves" (yorkshire), etc.
Venus: And you?
how about a 'What would Hitler do?" t shirt?
08,01Mutterguy: i like it!
08,01my god, i am going to hell...
Venus dont forget to mark manchester as mutha buckers
XD
Yes you are Venus. Yes you are.
Venus: but you're going to hell in a shirt satin will be jelly of
satin?
Actually if we want to even more offensive we need more misogny and rape. but that's not my department
08,01i'm not drunk!

Uncle Mario knows what's best for you.

lol
11,02You can only reply back to them with the following three messages: 'I understand.', 'I did not violate the terms of the Miiverse blah blah.', and 'I have edited my Mii, Mii blah blah now uncensor it'
You left me at a cliff-hanger
wow
SuperBrony64, maybe a song will cheer you up http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=mFFw-jItguo
That's right boy, you better understand.
SuperBrony64: fried chicken watermelon

Misunderstandings, can we?
AdamTheDuck: that this is adorable in every language :O
oni_link, ikr :D
oni_link, except English :|
totally AdamTheDuck XD
english has the worst version imo
It didn't even have a song ;-;
It didnt... and the VA is annoying :|
11,02Part of the reason I'm upset is that I drew a picture and they deleted it because of the quote.
;~;
13?
13oh
13it's nintendo
SuperBrony64 that sucks :|
/me gives SuperBrony64 an internet cupcake to attempt to cheer him up
00,10I seem to recall that comeing up with the nintendo approved comments discussion we had way back when they anounced wiiU present facebook
00,10sucks they would do that
11,02They did, but their censorship sucks.
11,02It's even worse than censoring the Sopranos on cable TV
you serious??
11,02I'll show you the message I posted that they deleted.
11,02Alright, refresh embed
00,10hey Phase4, is it bad that I have to move my rockets to the runway to launch them?
"With the new Wii U message system, talk to your friends and make new ones online! Warning: Posts must have the words Mario, Nintendo or Wii to be sent without termination of your account."

13FUN IS MANDATORY
13THE COMPUTER IS YOUR FRIEND
aw come on!!!!!!!
those pics are great and they were already censored
damnit
11,02What's wrong with this?
nothing

"With the new Own U administration system, FUN will be focused in a Nintendo friendly environment!"
00,02Sumica, thats a sign that you're doing it right

IM sure you would XD

11,02Hey aniderp
Hello aniderp
11,02Take a look at these messages that I'm allowed to send to them
00,10you would probably get a nice 350dollar paper weight SuperBrony64
I got kicked from brawl's online services for that on an older console
because of the taunt messages
11,02I would like them to explain to me what's wrong with the message I posted.
its dumb :I
you did nothing wrong
it wasnt vulgar
it wasnt offensive
and it was clearly censored
i missed what happend..
But did it have the word Mario in it?
aniderp, SB's post was deleted because apparently he was violating the Miiverse Code of Conduct.
If not, you broke the rules."
"apparently"
mariomariomario
11,02Here's the Miiverse Code of Conduct
apparantly cartoon violence is offensive *shrugs*
and it was implied anyways, not shown
wow those guys are stupid
and not aimed at anyone
maybe its infringing SuperBrony64 ?
11,02Why wasn't the Beavis and Butthead drawing removed then?
^
It was his 2nd drawing that was removed.
Not the first
I guess someone got "offended"
how do you make friends over the wii u connection wouthout sharinf fc?
this makes me mad , not to mention that I saw that Metro is getting the plug pulled
SuperBrony64, are you able to write a ticket to ask why it was deleted?
11,02My ticket is 'Hey my thing didn't violate the code'
11,02That's all I can do from what it looks like
which is dumb
13yeah i doubt you'll win that
they make it so one sided
13consoles!
you cant even appeal
This is why Im saving up for a good PC and laptop. consoles upset me now
11,02This kind of thing makes me not want to post messages on Miiverse anymore.
I can see why
Hey SuperBrony64 do you have the box that has the Wii U phone number on there to call them talked to them about that drawing you did?
11,02Wii U Phone number?
yeah
11,02You mean the comment ID?

13"I Mario wanted to Luigi contest Peach my drawing Pikachu getting removed Kirby"
"A beepa a doopa a babba a barrow."
oh that was great Shizuka XD

SuperBrony64 what did they delete?
Then click on this: http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/435318-gak One of the reasons I love Bronystate.
11,02JRP2234: They deleted this...
Sumica: hmm... I guess I never noticed
Damnn.... should have seen that one coming. :(

11,02No, this that has 'Deleted by administrator'
KrazyNoobs: if that word is in anything you post, it auto kicks XD
nintendo WHAT THE FUCK
I know, I have had a few experiences, two with typos.
That's in the picture I put up.
I got a paddlin'
SuperBrony64 what else
Did anyone actually look at that picture? I just experienced that.
LITERALLY EXPERIENCED IT
Gawd, I love Bronystate.

omg
lel
SuperBrony64 30th i can get wii u
11,02Awesome :D
SuperBrony64 show me the message they sentyou
At least we don't get a paddlin' during the new episodes. I thank you mods for that, we FEED OFF typing the g-word into your chatroom during a fresh new episode.
SuperBrony64 i missed it
11,02JRP2234: They just said it violated the Miiverse Code of Conduct.
11,02Not specifically what I violated.
ring them
very unfair
Be right back... and yes, I could leave my system unattended. My brother is at school camp for 2 weeks.
My other brother respects my privacy, and my little sister doesn't know how to type.
SuperBrony64 weby show us the controller
with the webcam
how many zombies are there with me? xD
chat ded
00,10hmmmm the panic button on the mechJeb seems to be the blow shit up button
11,02On the plus side, I bought a USB cable today that allows me to charge my Wii U GamePad from the console itself rather than the AC Adaptor.
k
wait, the gamepad has an AC adapter?
is that what comes with it?
11,02Yeah
not a fan of those :I
SuperBrony64 show us the controller
webcam
at least theres a USB though
11,02That cable I bought today advertises that it works with the 3DS and DSi, which it does not as the connector is different. I messaged Nyko (the one who made the cable) about it today on Twitter. The post I gave earlier was the response when I brought it up. They apologized that future box art wouldn't have that error on it.
and a new cable on the way I hope
11,02Nah, that cable is just meant for charging the Wii U Gamepad.
oh
11,02The connector looked similar to the 3DS and DSi so they thought it would work with that too.
ah so they dun goofed bad
SuperBrony64 we like your face
this is true :3
hm
im getting wii u in 2014 :P

/me licks Moopy
eww why did you just lick me?
Because you taste like moop Moopy .-.
Ummm ok
Ducks cannot extend their tongues past their beaks. It's duck anatomical fact.
Therefore, ducks cannot lick anything.
/me ish an internet duck >.>
and how do i taste like moop?
-pokes the duck-
Your argument is invalid.
-pokes dolan-

AdamTheDuck: full of d'aww
/me wants a pet cat named Octavia :3
How are actions preformed, such as, X did [something] to Y? Do you need special priviledges to do that?
I am not too familiar with the multiple functions of PonyChat.
/me asks if KrazyNoobs means the way I am speaking right now?
-says yes, knowing that he has miserably failed at trying what AdamTheDuck did-
put /me in front of a message
/me rolls around the room
/me Hi!
/me simply tells KrazyNoobs that it is simple and all one requires to do is to type /me before typing
/me Gives a huge thanks to AdamTheDuck and aniderp
/me flails his arms about as he runs around chat
/me types /me before a message
/me slaps SuperBrony64 around a bit with a large trout
/me needs a dispenser in this very spot
Try not to go overboard on the /me though
/me AdamTheDuck created a monster on this chat.
Extreme RP is bannable.
Just kiddin'
But seriously, it is a pretty cool function.
I do
we started to decorate the room
Moopy, nope.
hmmmmm
wish i can help
/me puts on his coolface
shall we finish decorating bronystate?
yup
i can putting tinsel up
its shiny :>
Now when are you guys gonna do something with Hearth's Warming Eve?
we are
gyrobowl is the topper
^
on the tree
our tree not up yet
my tree over here is already up
In Australia, we just decorate our native Norfolk Pines. THey grow up to 35m (around 110 feet) high. Always fun to decorate.
the base is but
need to be put together
Our class had 5 trees in our vicinity. The 5 out of 19 bronies in the class took one of them and did JUST PONY.
i need a pony on the tree
derpy ornament and dash ornament
Although the Year 3s asked if they could join in, and they brought their sh--ty G3 ponies in, and started hanging them up. We had to tolerate them, but we were pissed.
The tree was once beautiful, but now honestly sucks. Us Year 12s had a good tree, and the Year 1s and 3s wrecked it.
i need a zelda tree.. and a pony tree..
We used hand-made clay pony ornaments. They looked like crap, and we also used McDonalds pony toys that we had.
aniderp: this is relevant to my interests :3
it is?
aniderp: yes
i love zelda stuff
/me snuggles her zelda blanket
Anyone here still going through school? If so, any bronies in your class?
me too , I have a triforce wallet, I want a link plushie though
there are some bronies at work i guess..
5 of the kids in my Year 12 class are bronies.
well Im in between jobs so this question isnt for me lol
lets see.. marissa asks me if i watch the episode on saturday
that count?
pony spin(vinyl on record) my freind likes that one
its like filly vinyl on a record going along to watch out here she comes
One of the marine biologists I work with at UnderWater World Mooloolaba (wierd Aussie names) like G3. She hates what happened to the show, so I hate her.
haha wow
least vanessa dont play g3..
she plays g1 sometimes..
What I mean is, she loves G3, hates G4. I hate people like that, but still tolerate them... hope no g3 people in here that i offended, if so, sorry
sea ponies shoo be doo
The first G1 promo was Okay, I guess.
The second one still was barely watchable, but not too bad.
The third one and all of the G1 from there on, in my opinion, stunk.
But really, how could someone actually mindlessly sit at a screen and enjoy something that had little effort put into it, and was a marketing scheme for 3 - 5 year old girls? The first two episodes of G1 didn't stink too bad, but from there on, I didn't like it. G2 was quite interesting, with the urban setting, but still sucked in my opinion. No offence to those whose childhood consisted of mainly this. With G3, I don'
I thought there was no G2
^ I miss Val correcting everyone ;~;
aw :<
btw, my little sister watched G3 all the time when she was 4, the same episode over and over again. It was called Starsong's Song. I would go for a thirty minute bikeride everytime she watched this. I became fit.
wow
G2 existed, but it wasn't anything special. Just like G1 ponies, except in a retro-urban setting, with houses, tvs, radios, gyms, shops... everything a little girl would enjoy, but not us.
This is stupid.
Too much 'icky romantic' stuff in there too.
That's what I told my friends as a youngster.
RawketLawnchair: beep boop son
youre on "Off the Air"
But really, the primary focus was... *inhales dramatically* ... boys. The girl ponies had crushes on the male ponies, but the male ponies were huge jerks, so the morals were warped and completely wrong.
Beep boop.
/me boops oni_link
beep o.o
I am a robot
brb
/me KrazyNoobs catches his breath after his explanation... wait, he typed.
/me he rested his fingers. THERE>
11,02Mooo \:D/
Mooooo
/me Tips the cow.
11,02O.O
/me realises he said that to an admin. Puts a gun to his head.
11,02D:
okay lets tone down the RP in here
11,02nuuuuuuu
11,02Also what oni_link said
oni_link, ^
Remember, excessive RP is bannable.
What's wrong with italic?
:D
why does Duke Nukem Forever suck so much :I
its trying too hard and its too little, too late
SuperBrony64: Where the streams at
Pinkie is funny sometimes heh fun fun fun fun fun

Thanks to FiW
I liked her from Season 2 Episode 24 to Season 3 Episode 4 so far.
SO MUCH ADORABLENESS With G3, I don'

Sweetie Drink from a straw... that's a paddlin'
LOL

11,02RawketLawnchair: Refresh embed
http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/435318-XXX replace the XXX with that gooey stuff
gunthler: Im going to take a shot in the dark here and say RD is your favorite
probably, oni_link.
lol
/me avoided a paddlin
SuperBrony64: I refeshed everything. NO streams here. . .
Good morning Bronystate! :$
The new stream doesn't work for me.
Hey MadSurge.
AdamTheDuck: I actually like Scootaloo in this episode but I still like Sweetie Belle and Applebloom more
I like Sweetie Belle the most out of the CMC :3
All I've got is the Twitch embed.
is good pony :3
Finally, an RD gallery without that... shot... that /mlp/ likes from S2E07... *shrugs at the thought of it*
SuperBrony64: Me too, Ive been refreshing and I dont has stream :<
I don't want to --- i-s-d- r------ ----
11,02What browser are you using?
Firefox
I like this picture of her, but /mlp/ ruined it. I thought it was a good picture before it was defiled in such a manner. http://archive.heinessen.com/boards/mlp/thumb/0042/18/1346300462472s.jpg is the picture, putting aside the meme that got attached to it, do YOU think it's a good picture? Reminds me of a cat.
11,02How bout now?
now I got it!
11,02Sweet :)
Groovy
Yup
BO2 is up.
KrazyNoobs: Its like meh. I personally like the one where she's messing with the guards
dat emblem :3
Same. /mlp/ tied a disturbing meme to that picture I just put up. http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-to-cum-inside-rainbow-dash here's the meme if you are curious, but it has iffy content.
Pinkie giving Rainbow Dash an epic hoof
KrazyNoobs: I can see by the link
careful now
Yup... cannot unsee
Aw, crap, I see what I did there.
/me slaps himself.
SuperBrony64 weby
I still think (here comes a paddlin') gak is funny.
You should probably investigate further into ways to prevent chatroom guests from mentioning that g-word. They can just say g a k, or say g - a - k. If I get a paddlin' I would know that you guys are responsible, and have it under control.
No? Should probably get that fixed. An easy way for offenders to say that.
well yeah i think its meant as an anti-flood mechanism
thats it really
just so there arent text walls full of that word
and cause im guessing people are getting tired of it
I might get this game but for 360
Can't run it on PC and all my friends own 360s
Kaboom
I can run MW2 and MW3 but I kinda don't like those games
/me rolls around ded chat
11,02crud
I love the explosions that occur with 2000 people spamming with that word during a ga-k commercial. The comment you say with g-- g-- -ak only is around for 1.5 seconds or less. I love BronyState.
11,02>more points
11,02>2nd place
woot woot 2nd
/me will be right back after these messages. *4 --- commercials in a row*

and then someone rage quit and disconneted :I
brb
11,02Now then, to see if Nintendo relisted my post
here we go
im abck
*I'm back.
By the way, what do I do if the stream will not work for me. Do I need to download any specific plugin?
11,02No, just go to the link provided in the stream embed
looks like this isn't going to get re-upped :|
/me tried again and it worked. Fails to withdraw previous comment.
/me will now stop abusing RP
thanks
lol
is this a resistive touchscreen SuperBrony64?
11,02Yeah
no
NINTENDO WTF Y NO CAPACITIVE TOUCH SCREEN
/me dies
00,10that might just be the strangest thing you have said
/me is already in love with the RP function... cannot... stop...
But I have to.
SuperBrony64 complaine to nintendo FOR NOT PUTING A PROPER TOUCH SCREEN ON THE CONTROLLER
The only thing I complain about
is complaining
Another thing I complain about
is the paddlins you get when discussing g-k.
Actually, I like it.
It's good at any time except during the episode. Us bronies NEED to g-kspam during a new episode.
Well damn I wasn't expecting much but I did better than I thought for this year's Famicompo-mini (achiptune competition) . I placed 33rd out of 48 entries for the originals section and 62nd out of 90 entries for the covers section :3
/me is not sure whether anyone is here or nobody cares
Latter.
Im going to upload my entries to my YouTube within the next week :3
SuperBrony64 wake up
The whole chatroom is asleep. LOL

If it helps I am biased against asus because their after purschase support sucks

Bronysith, a step ahead of you <3
Buytoast: he was doing it for a convention
i love the whole world i lovve the clear blue sky
well then he could've changed at the bathrooms there
You love my pretty picture I posted? ITTTZ PRIIIITTTTYY
he's already clamoring fora ttention there, why does he need to do it everywhere along the way
cause it is funny
and u just jelly cause you cant do good cosplay
man i freaking love this commercial
the only time for dressing up is for either a prade or halloween
some should cosplay as g-k
or if you're doing something illegal i suppose
or conventions
or for fun
/me mixes gak with water and asplodes
now you don't need to do it for ceonventions
you can if you want to
/me gets a paddlin'
but then you keep it there
hell im probably going to dress up as phoenix wright-the wig and people will not even know it is cosplay
Buytoast: you just jealous cause you cosplay terribly
its always a good time whoa o oh
you start putting that stuff in everyone's faces when there's no context and you're just being obnoxious
i dropped my phone in the pool again D:
I am cosplaying as gak for Sunshine Coast Bronies Hearth's Warming Eve in Brisbane.
boom diiaada boom diaada boom diaada boom diaada
Buytoast: considering you are insulting every convention goer ever, yea, im defending them
like Emo McPissfoot in that picture there
/me gets a paddlin'
not insulting them all
they wanna wear it when they're there fine
speaking of ponies..
but you go onto a train or some shit and start acting like the character there
well you're just disgraceful
...what
how is that?
you wouldnt be saying that if it was like deadpool or something
Holy shit it's just a cosplay you little bitch. Get over it.
^
/me is obsessed with jelly.
Frekin honestly Buytoast, nothing but shit comes from you.
/me covers KrazyNoobs in jelly and takes him to bed
oh no, he has an opinion! I know I'll insult him! that'll show him!
/me http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/433/245/37c.png
boy
Opinions are sometimes better to be kept to yourself.
/me puts on coolface
Jmo: like racism?
Hey guys
Applies to everything.
/me covered Bronysith with gak and got a paddlin'
/me loves BronyState
/me is undecided
/me NEEDS AN ADULT
/me is an adult
just saying, if you can't handle other people's opinions
/me poops on Bronysith
well maybe you shouldn't speak at all
quit it with the RP
I can handle other people's opinions, but when you start calling my friends not nice names of course I'll jump your neck.
/me quits RP
So back the fuck off and drop it.
i wasn't insulting your friends
Jmo: how much you wanna bet if it was some sort of hot chick he wouldnt be insulting
see, now you're just making stuff up
Buytoast: actually you were
Bullshit, you were insulting him.
so your friend is that fella in the picture?
No shit.
/me got eaten by Slender Man.
YEA
well see, now you tell me this after the fact
Buytoast: doesnt matter, you still insulted him
doesn't change anything, except that now it's jsut a personal vendetta for you
so you'll just grasp at straws
and that you're just an asshole
^
/me is waiting for someone to comment, "Well that escalated quickly!"but then realises that joke was old 2 weeks ago.
Buytoast: if it was some hot chick in cosplay you wouldnt be insulting it
but that's not something i kept a secret
everyone knows i'm an asshole
if it was some hot chick doing the same thing then yes
BIAS
with lots of hats
anyone who clamors for attention like that
an asshole with lots of hats
i'm not a big fan of
/me NEEDS A DISPENSER HERE!!!
Implying that he even wants attention.
It's just a fucking cosplay.
If he wanted attention he would do something like Gundam or something
something that is really fucking out there
boy, you guys are ignoring everything i've said about it
this must be like talking to a rock feels like
/me rolls around the lights
I'm listening to special k.
/me is waiting for the flame-war to end.
Jmo: what is with this piece of shit?
Not even gonna bother with him anymore, waste of time.
Jmo: wanna go get lunch?
Lunch at 1957, seems legit.
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, THANK YOU

Jmo: or food or something, idk

Steak on a BBQ. mmm.

opinions are like acid to you
i luv what music brings ,cause i just love to sing , except for one part , like justin beiber's fart, i luv the whole world , just not the crzay parts , boomdeyadaa boomdeyadaa
considering you arent a real cosplayer at all, your opinions are nothing
http://ponceysounds.tumblr.com/image/36552956606
wait, so you have to have intricate knowledge of something just to have an opinion?
do you know how utterly stupid that sounds
hey relax dude , cosplay are cosplay , you like it
ok
you dont like it
ok
be relax and groovy
pokemon white 2 the adventures of gyrobowl

hey man just chill , this is a friendly place and all
this is the internet
Friendliness is not welcome
this isn't a friendly place at all
where have you been for the past hour
well this is a friendly place when we make it so , how are we going to do that if you guys dont just relax and chill out
readying for work :S - should be leaving now, but this 4 day weekend has made me a touch lazy.....lazier
and all of this tension for a matter pf personal interests .come on relaxx
*of
as long as I get there around 7, no one's gonna care
its past 7..
its 7 30 here
not here :) I'm an hour behind you
oh
Buytoast: 'Emo McPissfoot', eh? I'm flattered, but I'm not sure if you can really talk on the whole 'emo' front, seeing as you're essentially a less amusing, less likeable version of Meanwhile.
Whoops.
and heres the man of the hour "drum roll" ScootaChicken
hello
Morning
Bronysith: I just felt it was unfair that you and Jmo were defending me all on your lonesome, I'm a big boy after all, I can look after myself :P
ScootaChicken: you werent here though mate
Well I'm here now ^_^
ScootaChicken: and i hate seeing people insulted for their hard work
>hard work
what work?
O_o...that's quite a switch - playlist chose a Tenacious D's Beelzebub after Winter Jazz Up ended - Damn You Playlist >_<
>clothes from my wardrobe and poorly applied makeup
Lel.
oooooooooohhh
i'm guessing that's the guy from the barefoot picture?
ScootaChicken: considering you were walking around everwhere, barefoot
the cosplay thing
Bronysith: Hardly a big deal, I did DofE :P
walking barefoot is not that bad
ScootaChicken: but your feet were murder right?
Weren't too bad to be honest.
so did he just come here to whine about me not liking him playing dress up or what?
*sings aloud in an overacting manner*
Buytoast: theres opinions, then theres insulting people for what they enjoy
Buytoast: Do you see me whining?
you were a bit ago mate
although i do have a question for ya
were you on a bus or a train?
cause i don't know of many trains with cushiony seats
:3 That's enough of that....I think my brother heard that one :D
Calling me 'Emo McPissfaggot' is hardly going to get me to think you're a paragon of virtue and goodwill.
i don't care
relaxxxx dudes. like you said this is the internet and there something that peple like and others that people dont
i don't even know who you are
And I was on a London Underground train.
ah
fancy ass train
looked like one of those luxary shuttle things
Hardly, most underground trains smell like piss and boozy vomit.
well yeah
i take the L to my classes
but your trains look better than mine
What country do you live in?
MURIKA
I dunno about trains in MURICA, guessing they have plastic seats then?
the ones i ride do
heck we dont even have quality buses here
Sleepy chat - Wake Up http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo1d26Y5LiY
Basically every bus and train in England has fancy cushiony seats, which is nice I suppose.
/me clings onto someone
damn
dont make me go to work ;_;
Shiiieett
/me drags aniderp to work
nuuu
only thing i rode on with cushiony seats was that one shuttle to that comic con thing back in march or some shit
now that was comfy
Although they really aren't as comfortable as they look, seeing as they tend to have chewing gum stuck to every seat.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
damn man, don't dissipate my illusions of granduer
