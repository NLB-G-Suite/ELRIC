Scoot-Scootaloo: I'd call that sleeping xD
Half the chat hardly talks anyway

Oh my Gosh, you're right Buytoast! The Murrikan way of winning an argument!

No, there's a chatroom.

Opinions on Mandopony, is he a pedophile?
Why would you even bring something like that up?
O_o
ive heard it going around alot
Go ask somewhere else.
Whos Mandopony?
This isn't the place to be asking that, at all.
^
youtube MLP musician
Oh
=_=
RaveBrony he did loyalty
He hangs around with appleblooms voice actor
But yeah, not the place for that :L
shes 13 i think.
Malmortius: I seriously doubt he is.
Me either AJ
but
alexxm: I shall go look that up, lol
from Creber herself
The worst thing Mandopony done is acknowledge the rumours..
If someone is accused of being a pedophile, its never forgotten.
feel kinda bad for the guy.
Malmortius then why spread lies
im not spreading lies. What the hell?
I woulve never known had you said anything :(
was looking for a bit more info
or opinions
ohai everyone

DarkColt: I just got that :D
Ugh, that mane detail.

Stunning
Mmmm

^
^^
I can't wait to get a tablet so I can make slightly less crappy art
Agreed.
weeping_pegasi82, get a (Wacom) tablet :p
Viking pony is probably my favorite. Now that is some detail.
^
Agreed
Candybar bumtaze :333
Lolwut
A candybar.....and tazing someone's bum?
Oh god theres more! <3
or a candybar tazing someone's bum?
It's a Deus Ex joke.
Oh.
My bad. :$
that would explain why I didn't get it
See, when he played Deus Ex a while back, he gave candy bars to little kids.
Iwant just a better PC to handle good DAWs to make my music in a better way
And then bum tazed them into the water.
o_o
Like a sir.
:D
Lmao
:D
05love that song
is that you drawing again Wrek?
eeyup
Nice
I need to get a tablet so I can draw
:\
QuinnThePegaSistta: you could do it with a mouse like I do but....
my mouse drawings look like poo
With a table you'll have a steadier hand.
Got it, w00t \ o / ALL the headshots!
lol
I can't draw for my life
I write, but I can't draw
oh trust me they do
That's actually pretty legit
I guess it just takes practice
Damn so he does legit draw every strand of hair
Some people are realist/perfectionists O_O
Also; am now up to episode 47! xD
Gaaaa Potty break brb
I prefer drawing cartoons, my realistic stuff looks like crap
well actually you could say I like creating new stuff
05more badass music :3
yay~
:3
Wrek of course
But you usually play badass music :o
somehow its more unusual if wrek were to play something not-awesome
Ich bin back!
Teglo, you know I love this right?
You know that right?
I love this!
When I get a proper job I'll come up there and harass your northern ass!
I never throught I'd need a Youtube-Uploader, but they leave me no choise :/
how many layers do you think wrek has going on there?
A lot :3
...Oh hey! I remember you Manearion!
Yo Lady!
:D
No wait that RD smily does not accuratly represent my reaction... :)
That's better!
^_^
sounds friendly
Brilliant orchestral death metal!
I believe I've heard of them.
Ever listen to Death, Manearion?
Oh yes!
old school that~
:DDDDDDD
Yayayayayayaay
Any favorites?
But wherever I turn in metal, I allways keep coming back to Finntroll~
muffin
Trollhammeren!!!
Oh yes!
And Ett Norrskensdåd <3
The whol Ur Jorden Djup is a brilliant recdord!
LadyCanary dat tecnicchly correct spelling xD
XD
All their albums are actually really good!
To be honest, Mane, I havent listened to a great amount of them.
um.... here's a question to get people talking: Octavia or Vinyl Scratch?
Octavia
Though I do plan to download some Raubtier today.
AND scratch
Ooo Raubtier xD
Those are some angry ass mofos.
I prefer octavia
weeping_pegasi82: Both? :3
/me query Magical_Pablez94
...
oops?
AJIsAwesome: -_- sure
Vinyltavia <3
...uh. hi
hey Invincible
weeping_pegasi82: What's wrong?
hi, new to this websight
I ship them. I ship them like the 1776 English fellt.
good evening
*fleet.
AJIsAwesome: the point is to pick ONE
Hey Invincible , welcome! :)
hi
Welcome, Invincible! Make sure you read the rules ^_^
^
Hai Invincible :)
I have small comic somewhere here to describe that...
Well, welcome Invincible! Make sure to read the Rules and FAQ and I hope you have a great time here! :)
okey dokey wokie!
So that you may have an enjoyable time.
welcome Invincible
yay I said hi to him first!
http://fav.me/d50uihp
Should answer the question.
*waves to the fellow bronys*
:)
*and pegasisters*
Mane, your pony's facial hair is most glorious
brony can be either boy or girl
:D
Meh, brony is a unisex term imo
I just made it similair to mine~
yeh, i prefer brony dispite being a girl
He's supposed to represent me after all.
At least you have a cutie mark XD
Indeed!
I am blank ;3;
A jaws harp. First instrument I ever learned to play.
cool
D:
Awww...
Interesting Mane.
Ive got to draw my CM
my flank was blank
huh
A lot of people seem to have blank flank OC's... Knowing your talent is not very easy!
yeh.....so.... who here is a blank flank?
I like a lot of things @_@ metal, dolls collecting, plushies, etc.
metal and doll collecting? I didn't think they went together
I love to much music to define as certain genre! But I was brought up on scandinavian folk music so I seem to return there wherever I go.
I am a collector too
Ah, I remember when Wrek played some of that on his stream, Manearion
Dude, metal and My Little Pony was not thought to be very compatible.
then again cute ponies and grown men didn't go together
Yeah, defining yourself into a stigma seems kinda dull.
^^^^
Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners :3
Just like what you like.
/me spits out water. Excuse me Derpy_Hooves?
^
I know a show with cute ponies
Derpy_Hooves: I know, right? :O
LadyCanary Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners
"I'm metal, so I do metal stuff" "i'm pop so I do pop stuff." "I'm artsy so I do hipster stuff."
And Wreky, I love that little bit of hair you're working on <3
Manearion: Well screw that.
I'm so horse I do horse puns
Yes Teglo I will marry you and have your children.
O_O
:|
but ponies ARE metal
go look up "my little pony meets emtal" on youtube
Derpy_Hooves: alltime10s? :3
yes
listen to that!
Dude, CyrilTheWolf <3
Ponemetal.
lets see, epic music, drawing..... looks like a wrek stream if im not mistaken
...
yeah well, also his name in the corner B)
The only pony related song I ever made is very much not metal xD
That detail on the headphones. *swoon*
But I listen to a lot of metal now. Fall and winter is metal seasons!
Even some Gorgoroth if in the mood.
Hm...they sound familiar.
M'kay; I'm finally up to the end of season 2
Norwegian black metal at it's best.
>:C I AM READY!
Oooh :3
Gaahl may be a pretty silly and pretentious man, but he's got a delicious voice <3
And another random question Manearion: Do you like Mercyful Fate/King Diamond?
Have barly heard them to be honest!
Ah
Brb checking out.
For Mercyful Fate, listen to the album Dont Break the Oath.
Bue Manearion :)
And King Diamond himself, The Family Ghost is a favorite song of mine.
*bye
ha. look at tht http://derpiboo.ru/106613?scope=scpe16b29325d433e53e532eed0a64f29765d12b8e2f

Manearion: IKR?!!?! I would kill for King's falsetto
....uh, hi! im symphony, a pegasister and this is my first time talking to fellow bronys!!!!
It's pretty sweet!

*Sparzanza
Vordox: Um, you sure about that? :D
i mean make pictures
AJIsAwesome: Yes, everyone can draw.
<-----Art goes there
In your name LadyCanary ? :P
You draw Lady?
Vordox: just not as good as wrek can
weeping_pegasi82: Of course not
Noone can draw as Wrek
I'm gonna go. I don't want to see this until its finished.
But he can't draw anything else. :P
Oh goodness no, Manearion. I am awful artist xD
I can't draw
.....SABATOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
bye Jageman
Bye Jageman
Haha, Sabaton!
cya
Im trying to improve my drawing :\
You're in the army... Now.
That's great Ravers!
I would do very bad things to Joakim (sorry Wreky xD )
I need to get into drawing. :D
T_T why is BBBFF so frekin' sad?!
Drawing is so much fun!
art is were it's at today
I can tell. :D
Somehow I have forsaken all my artsing missions and been playing Minecraft nonestop...
Good lord that game is addictive!
Good colt.
/me pets Manearion
compare and be amazed
Dark_Horst: Don't
Lol :P
Well then :P
Vordox: how come?
05this will be interesting
Dark_Horst: Not even the same goal on each picture
Wrek: hey
Vordox: evolution of style does not have to be connected to goal
i really dont get your thought process right now
Dark_Horst: Noone does.
But what I mean is that the artstyle are different based on what/how they were draw
Not on HOW they would be
...Raubtier? :3333
Vordox: i'm pretty sure there's something called learning involved
i saw the streams when he started trying new styles
he said so himself
that evolved into this
Dark_Horst: Yes...but is it the same then?
If it evolved?
=P
you know what else evolves?
pokemon :3
Vordox: yeah, that's kinda the poitn i'm pointing out
Dark_Horst: Well your point is invisible to me.
=P
Wrek: nice editing skills
Vordox: you'rs isnt very visible either
Dood. I bet 100% that Wrek is streaming :P
Okay, so either princess cadence is a real... well, you know. Or someone is impersonating her.
hello everypony
You'd be correct!
Hello, Rocket
Hello Rocket
Hi, Rocket. :)
AJIsAwesome: Aw sheet son
Hello Rocket
Dark_Horst: Heh, double lost cause.
hey Rocket

No one said Hello to me, well... I didnt start with a hello :/
:C hello BronyDarth !
HI BronyDarth
Hello BronyDarth
Hai BronyDarth, sorry :$
hello BronyDarth
Hai Rocket :)
hi BronyDarth and Rocket
ohai MLP_Brovakiin :D
How to get famous on Bronystate: Say that everyone forgot to say hello to you, its amazing
=____=
i feel used
:D
Theres no such thing with getting famous here.
^
^^
finally i can watch wrek drawning
just mildly noticed
^^^^
^^^^^^
I'm crazy famous.
spam alert
Lauren Faust has nothing on me.
No wai
ttly
somehow I doubt that
=P
Hello everyone.
Dude I have like... 50 followers on Tumblr! I'm like the Jimi Hendrix of everything!
The most ironic part about this chat room. It was a coincidence that I had Darth in my name, now Bronysith is my best friend.
Manearion: I've only heard about you today
But that's the shape rules, when it comes to the real drawing his perfected for himself would be...
Hello Slater
god damnit i wish i could draw like wrek :E
I didnt see you Slater :P
Rocket, don't we all?
Hello Slater
Rocket practice
So you think Weeping
So you think.
05meh this got boring
Vordox: yeah, his style changed. artistic development. still dont know why that other comparison was a bad one
It's Okay BronyDarth
well anyone could draw like wrek if they practiced
I can draw better than Wrek, I'm gonna post a picture, beating the crap out of wrek!!!!
Chrysalis|BL2 i did some gak at paintchat .. is that practice ? :D
I can't draw worth shit
weeping_pegasi82 people could draw as well as wrek#
For colouring.
a really, really, long
When did this become a contest?
time
but NO ONE can draw like wrek but wrek
^
^^
Yay Audioslave <3
I draw liek Tyr :D
AJIsAwesome: The original versaion, and reprise for BBBFF is so sad, I can't stand it xD
Vordox: yeah. soooooooo?
Oh this is soothing
Can you guys critique my work that I made in Illustrator?
Dark_Horst: Let's say I'm one who follows rules. :P
sure
Vordox: picking up new techniques and methods is an integral part of artistic development
Rules of art/shape/Blend/Form/Colour etc etc
Slater: go ahead
What program do you use Wrek ?
Instead of seeing a whole picture
Rocket: he uses SAI
Vordox: what are these "rules of art" that you speak of
weeping_pegasi82: Keep mind i don't use Illustrator that much
Slater: ok
Vordox: different styles can be compared just as well, if they're not from the same phase of that evolution
Goddammit looking good so far Wrek
shame we can't see her eyes
best part of Wrek's work if you ask me are the eyes
What program is this?
otakon, ikr
otakon SAI ? whats that ?

Dark_Horst: And that's why I said you brought up a bad comparrison, since you did not focus on what has evolved imo
Adobe corel SAI painter
DarkColt: I know, right? :O
well, it may be froma dobe, but it'S called paint tool SAI
Ok, everyone, who's best at drawing, me, or Wrek? My drawing: http://imgur.com/d8HMy
BUt that's cause I dislike catergorizing when it comes to no borders.
AJIsAwesome: WE SHALL LOVE AND TOLERATE THE HELL OUTTA HER! >:C
Dude, Paint Tool SAI is not adobe!
Vordox: everything has evolved. that's the point
^

your gonna have a bad time
I already beat him dude.

Manearion so whats that ?
WREK I WILL BREAK YOU
Manearion: suspected that
And I will have a good time doing it!
Competing aginast Wrek is bad for your health :$
When did this become a competiton in the first place?
Look at my drawing.
If you didnt.
Dark_Horst: I can't say evolved, rather changed with that comparisson
wow. Wrek is talented
I think no one saw my drawing.
Punkie_Pue, well I'm more talented :P
I wish I could contribute to the art community.

ALLWAYS TABLET GRRRR
How does one love and tolerate a changeling?!
Well, I'm not using fancy stuff as Wrek is using, I'm using real stuff, like MS paint :P

Wait, this is the final episode of Samurai Jack?
Everyone knows the bad guys loses, in the 90s, the bad guys always won.

Dark92Enigma: I didn't give away any spoilers! :O
The last episode involved Jack and a baby.

Buytoast: I thought it was?
Yo everypony! :3
g/\k
... thats... so odd... that I asked about "has this series a finale" on the Finale withoput knowing it >.< toda was a strange day
How long do you think this show would have gone on for if it didnt end prematurley?
no, the last one is the baby one
there we go
Hi, TheMonstaMuffin. :)
DarkColt: just a heads-up :)

How long do you think this would have gone on for if it didnt end prematurely?
who knows
oh i saw animation bug >.<

This legitimitaly looks like Chuck Norris vs. Bruce Lee.
And it ended atwhat 4?
Is this the final episode?
TheMonstaMuffin: Nope.
Actually...no.
Last episode where Jack and AKu fight.
Nope,avi
52 Episodes and 4 seasons
AJIsAwesome: Oke

This is the last time we see them in battle
otakon: No, i'm talking about this episodes.
*episode

hold on
otakon: Still running!?
TheMonstaMuffin: hiatus
otakon thought it would be finished by now
i doubt it'll ever be finished
dont do spoilers!
TheMonstaMuffin: Genndy needs financing
From what I heard the head animator of this got sent to the starwars clone wars cartoon
So it effectivly ended this
would be really wierd to have the last version of aku sound different
The show is currently on a hiatus. and Genndy himself stated that he's still working on the finale
lol fail
this is hand drawn ?
It happens, remember how LONG it took for the Prince and The Cobbler to be shown?
OH GET THIS!
05pretty much
Jonh Dimaggio was THE SCOTSMAN!
SpadeMagnes[School], Well.... You know, Disney already had CloneWars, now as they are making the new Star Wars movies, I guess this show would come back?

Haio, bronies
Hi, CountDoofus. :)
hiya CountDoofus
GENNDY, you're awesome
Hello CountDoofus

What ever makes people happy, not my determination to say whats wrong or right
08,01otakon: actually, according to quite a few religions, it makes you damned, and let's just say i can implement the dirty part myself
SpadeMagnes[School] exacly
Deacon: he's stressed out atm
08,01ekips: well, that's the plan; but see above
Deacon: his mother doesn't understand him
ah
I hate religious crap...
VenHur i m deist
Well there is nothing wrong with religion

just some of the people
Well, touche...
what Deacon said
who take the messages too literally
0,5Im not Deacon im bacon
Nyahh see
08,01well, it's less that my mother doesn't understand me, more that she's a homophobic, bloody-minded, 2nd rate thinker with no more graph of reality than a flattened teaspoon
otakon: It depends on how you exercise your religious believes?
08,01*gasp
PHIL LAMAR <3

Iroh is gone
...CGI one.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Throat cancer
SpadeMagnes[School]: And the last time we hear him, ins in the TMNT CGI FILM
Wait, whos Mako..?
VenHur: last project he did before cancer got him
SpadeMagnes[School]: IS*
DinkyDoo, VA of Aku
So thats Aku and Joker gone
DinkyDoo: famous Japanses descent actor and VA
CONE!
And truly, we're inspired
DinkyDoo: guy who also voiced iroh on avatar
08,01ekips: thanks man
Oh..
DinkyDoo: and Iroh from avatar
Oh..
08,01aye, it probably will
UNCLE IROH IS BEST UNCLE!
sorry I know that was random
otherwise, a smart man once said "The Solution to a Problem always starts with tha assisination of someone"
lol this one
08,01until then, i'll solve my problems with laughter, alcohol, and pills
I LOVE this one if only for THIS scene
me too
08,01maybe two out of those three at a atime
Alot of people say being gay is immoral.. but I dont see what the big deal is, if it makes them happy, not my problem
i'm a fan of the caffeine alcohol combination
aoooooowww
SpadeMagnes[School]: I say let people live how they want as long as doing so doesn't hurt others or themselves.
Aku dollars?
it's Mos Eisley
08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: see, my mum's argment is that because gays are chosing not to reproduce, they are of no use to the human race, and therefore are immoral and sick
Agreed, otakon.
I agree with otakon, leave oput the pills, laughter and alcohol solves most problems. :)
Samurai Jack is best pony.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Googooplex actually
I LOVE THIS BIT!
Just cafe for me
otakon: me too1
XD
otakon: me too!*
08,01Slumberwatcher: wait, leave out the pills but keep the alcohol? isn't that a bit hypocritical?
and the music too
08,01well, maybe not hypocritical... but something like it
play the same song!
Besides..isnt there a thing called adoption?
ekips: maybe it's a natural reaction to overpopulation?
Any one else getting a Star Wars vibe from this scene?
08,01ekips: being indian, you'd think she'd get this...
VenHur: eeyup
man I love this music
08,01oh boy, that made me laugh
otakon that's what I thought too^^
VenHur: A la Cantina?
otakon: Same, lol
Dark92Enigma: Eeyup.
what kind of nerve does he have?
...Jerk fish
asshat
YOU SPOILED MY TEA!
ORLY?
2 googooplex
What the hell is this guys problem?
The fuck is a googooplex?
SpadeMagnes[School]: bounty hunter
1 million googooplex
All the googooplexes
LadyCanary: birds eat fish right?
SpadeMagnes[School]: if I were to guess... some huge sum
SpadeMagnes[School]: their monetary unit
Not sure of canaries do
LadyCanary: lets find out?
googolplex folks, not googooplex http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex
DAT SWORD.
08,01AJIsAwesome: oh don't worry; i'm not suicidal
how much is a googolplex
XD
/me almost forgets to put a pillow for SpadeMagnes[School]'s feet
and she just keeps dancing
THIS SONG!
Dark_Horst: No non image links.
oh look,it's Chewie
lol, tiny
Awwwww.
tiny wookie
Baby Chewie!
chewie
yeah, dis you
LadyCanary: i really dont think text falls under that clause
08,01i just prefer popping opiates to drinking alcohol; it's arguably less damaging anyway
AAAAAAAAAAAA
Leeeroooyy!!
Well, reproducing is certainly not our only purpose, but it is a good thing.
And if your mother says the only use humans are to reproduce, what the fuck are jobs inventing things.....and other shit
/me 08,01hugs AJIsAwesome
Oh damn, not the hat
08,01i'm touched that you care
LadyCanary: we say non-image to include audio and video
RaveBrony: he'll make another
/me hugs AJIsAwesome
Ohhh right
My bad.
But text-intensive images seem to be okay.
/me also hugs AJIsAwesome :3
08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: want to make a racist joke... want to make a racist joke...
raging wookie style?
Hah
/me hugs Dark92Enigma- and MLP_Brovakiin back. :)
man, aku'S economy must be deep in the cellar with that rate of inflation
lololololooooooo
I fail to see how ANYONE could say humans only use is to reproduce
08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: she's not so much a retard, as completely blinded by pig-headed arrogance
Lots of Star Wars refferences in this episode...
Dark_Horst: he's EVIL ofc it is
Crazy round man
NO MONEY FOR YOOOOOOOU
lol this guy
SpadeMagnes[School]: Older generations are just set in their ways and are afraid or disapprove of change
08,01to the level that she will actually *make shit up* to justify her stupid views
Who the hell thinks the only use for humans is to reproduce?
08,01instead of looking at the evidence and basing her views on that
SpadeMagnes[School] governments and religious people
Oh boy.
AdamTheDuck: D'awww :3
We're popping poppies and drinking alcohol?
Sounds a little like Tom Kenny...
08,01actually, i think she might be on the low ende of the IQ scale: she tries to dupe the *scientist* with made up, unsourcable bullshit
VenHur: on Coffeine?
scientist?
08,01that's just retarded
Dark92Enigma: Eh dunno.
08,01Kandarihu: i check
08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: me
Oh shit yogi bear
How's everything? /

Is everything a fucking robot here?
08,01hey spight!
-And schlange is German for pensi

SpadeMagnes[School], only the things that are going to die.
SpadeMagnes[School]: almost

no it's not
russian bear
hydra bug
"Bitch sliced my favorite hat!"
IT'S HUNTORR!
Schlange is german for snake
I KNOW THAT GUY
08,01i'm okay tonight, i guess; just had to vent
hey it's that bounty hunter from dexter's lab
From Dexter
eeyup
Aww

HUNTORR!
Cute elephant :333
Penis is german for penis.
LadyCanary: dont' get used to it
Oh damn, so ded

Oh my god, it IS Huntorr!
it's eyes have smiley faces
RAGE!
Oh, I get this episode, I think
AdamTheDuck haha
AdamTheDuck: its true
Y'know, from that one Dial M for Monkey episode...
jack has an awesome warcry
Call Samus
Get Boba Fett
AdamTheDuck: Bill Nye
CALL BOBBA FET
FETT
Call Captain Falcon
anti-jack
SpadeMagnes[School]: /)
Fett is also german for fat
VenHur: which one?
Dem faces.
Reused clip!
which makes the character of boba fett uninteionally funny in the germna dub
....OMG.
he mad
I WANT SOME!
Who wants a piece
Jack hardly ever loses his cool
Dark93Enigma: I think the episode with the same name as the villain.
In one episode of the Powerpuff Girls, Bubbles said that SAME THING.
Jack is now Bubbles.
cue rage
oh fuck
._.
oh snap
08,01AdamTheDuck: hehe, that's so true
LadyCanary well they are in the same universe
It's like Falling Down
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE!
Not the sandal!
:[ YOU'RE GOING TO LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE MEEEEEEEEEEEE
Wut
Oh shit
Evil Jack Attack is COMING BACK!
negative jack
LadyCanary: Shout-out? :O
HOW DOES THIS EVEN WORK
SpadeMagnes[School]: Magic
True, Deacon.
magic
SpadeMagnes[School]: /)Aku(\
how the fuck doe electronic wanted posters do that?
VenHur: oh wait, i remember Huntor now
IT WAS A SANDAL
too much flashing
it's the future, they can do that
His sandal had no possible dna on his
Mad Jack
enter the negajack
VenHur: sorry, missed some of the chat because of my lil' bro
I don't think magic alone explains why this is happening.
Really milked the whole 'transform' bit there
Hope no one had seizures.
Of course, the obligitory evil clone cliche
VenHur brbrbrlbrlrblr
SpadeMagnes[School] it may had actually, would have to analyze it
Every show has to have one of those fucking things
I am thou. And thou art I
oh, this gonna be good
CLONES are usually cliche
VenHur, white and yellow is okay. It's red and blue that causes siezures.
QUICK! HAVE HIM STARE AT PAINT DRYING!
^
So how the fuck did they get a entire clone from a single sandal?
looked deep withing him. from a sandal
SpadeMagnes[School]: magic
otakon: best plan ever
that'S one deep sandal
Hay guys could you send me your e-mail address on query and I will send you one message because I want to check if my mail server works correctly?
I think more than magic would be required from a fucking sandal
SpadeMagnes[School] it's the future, plus Aku is magic :P
SpadeMagnes[School]: it's MAGIC
ooh
with whimsy?
with whimsy
left, right, left, right, left, right
SpadeMagnes[School]: yes with EVIL whimsy
noo, his pyjamas!
oh yeah, and overcooking a cake usually MAKES WISHES COMING TRUE
00,10how did he get his shoe back?
Gets cut with sword, says it hurts. Doesn't bleed?
Magic
You may "think" that , just as wellas may "ignore what you think" when it comes to frickin MAGIC
Is it back on?
animation error!
sumica: had a spare, why are you lower case?
SpadeMagnes[School]: [It's time for Venhur's Usless Knowledge!] I suppose the monitor must of copied the sandal...which SOMEHOW hold Jack's DNA, combined with...dark matter, I suppose?
dat hair
LurkerBrony: Magic sword
BADASS HAIR!
sweenie todd hair
Hah
Ok I understand a clone, but hpow the fuck did Aku CLONE THE GOD FORGED SWORD!
sumica: Magic. [snort snort]
._.
I can accept that it was caused by magic. I can accept that dead skin cells from Jack's sandal allowed the electronic wanted poster to magically produce an evil clone of Jack. I don't understand WHY an electronic wanted poster would magically produce an evil clone of Jack.
SpadeMagnes[School]: evil polar opposite copy
the SWEENIE TODDS HAVE BEEN DOUBLED1
..He now looks like Akuma.
hit the trees with a sword until they catch fire!
ok, that was random
Kandarihu: MAGIC GODDAMMIT!
the poster was made by Aku
Hey again. /
Aku has magic
Aku can do anything he wants
ello Spight
hiy Spight
SpadeMagnes[School]: molecular contruction
otakon, that only explains the how. The WHY is what baffles me
Magic explains everything. End of disscussion
00,10damn charcoal forest
the poster is more like a portal than a poster making a clone
Gah my stream stopped
how many times is he going to cut that sleve?
Hay guys could you send me your e-mail address on query and I will send you one message because I want to check if my mail server works correctly?
Obsidian: can it explain why kids love cinamon toast crunch?
Obsidian: broken down magic is nothing but another form of science. arcane science
Dafuq?
o_o
God damn it...fucking stream
AAAAAAAAH
Screaming!
um okay
the voiceactor had fun
rawr
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The whole clone cliche happens EVERYWHERE, you got this, Shadow Mario, Cosmic Mario, any clone of the Sonic The Fighters fighters...etc.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAA
VenHur Don't forget Dark Link
this is so epic
they're slashes caused a SONIC BOOM
Dark Samus
LadyCanary: SHUN GOKU SATSU
tunguska
*ching* *ching* *ching*
Heh.
Inb4 the solution is not fighting
Oh yeah, him too.
Metal Sonic, Shadow

Times like this, Fluttershy would NOT want to be a tree
make them suffer
ZEN TIME!
don't soothe them
Enlightentment throught burning tree reflections
dammit man, you're as bad as teh small horses when they didn't punish teh demon horse child
I guess the tree thing is a sort of way to say some "Save our enviorment" bullshit?

SpadeMagnes[School], indeed. It's terrible
tara strong was in avatar? it says she was azula's actress in the ember island players

And Aku is just like ''LOLOLOLOLOL''
Would I be going too far to say I think Aku sent the army to attack?
Aku just made an LOL face BEFORE it was cool.
but Jack can't ignore innocents in danger
btw, it IS tara trong. just looked it up
SpadeMagnes[School]: no but this time he didn't have anything to do with it

This cartoons would be more interesting if they showed blood
My favorite shipping is Derpy x Doctor Whooves.
Athgaar: you said there was an Avatar reference here. where?
Bronysith they're both monks
Athgaar: The Last Airbender is even worse though :D

the only MW i played was MW1, i missed MW2 and 3 aswell as BLack Ops 1 - 2 cause its all the same, nothing new xD
cant speak for that, never played it
7I had a dream last night where I went on something of a psychotic rampage and killed everyone I know.
05i will not buy a game that glorifies war, after playing spec ops the line
7It was pretty damned fun tbh.
05and MMS game*
^
Wrek: Thank you
It's likely that they'll make Call of Duty 5, MW4, and Black Ops III since the franchise is so god damn overrated!
are they not high enough level to use the flight ability that other guy had
Thank you for heeding that game
Dark_Horst: yup, anything after that in terms of Infinity Ward was just $60 DLC
/me has only played MW1
if so shouldn't they go back and get more levels
I liked Black Ops 2 better when it was called Modern Warfare
Wrek: only war against demons and interesting aliens
Wrek: So you're not going to buy the expansion? :P
magmablock: lol
Wrek: what'S mms game?
dat rock
05modern millitary shooter

I'm confused..Planetside 2 is not a modern military shooter?
wrek
05warfigther was my focus with that comment

05ekips: nope its a scifi mmofps

05arma 2 is a simulator
MY
ARSE
BF 1942 still the best for me
oni_link: Yeah... Shame it took me so long to realize that. It's why I won't pick up BOII, and whatever comes next.
Wrek: well, it tries :D

Dark_Horst: i did not see ai run around
CountDoofus: I heard the campaign was broken and you have to install a 1-2 GB update just to play it
Just got back from school :3
Vordox the greatest weapon ever
Oh. Well sod that.
/me hugs thelonepony back
05you cant even leave a room without gettign isntantly killed by the out of bounds mechanic

Ohai VenHur :)
/me hugs thelonepony back
how can suck a flimsy looking stick brake rock?
wipergone2: i've played the scenarios. the AI usually just zergs the objective. no tactics or taking vocer at all
05if you are too slow the AI does your objectives for you
Trollestia strikes again
QuinnThePegaSistta: YOU DO NOT KNOW THE POWER OF BO!
*cover
QuinnThePegaSistta: magic

He's trying to teamkill.
Wrek: oh yeah, I remember seeing a video by TotalBiscuit about that. Linearity.
Wrek: is dayz good
05havent played it
i mean did u see videos of dayz
wipergone2: it'S worth the money
I played DayZ
05aslo i quote yahtzee: "warfigther... bwhahahahaha
definately
You want to cry, play it
also played dayz
CountDoofus: Also I noticed that with EA lately, the Medal of Honor games are crap in terms of polish and build quality so just wait for the next battlefield game if you're going to buy from EA
AdamTheDuck: i know tht
pony_ridiculously long number: you can change your nick with /nick *insert name here*
wipergone2, fun if you don't mind the fustration
don't just blindly trust yahtzee though
DAT STOCK SFX PAIN SOUND
AdamTheDuck: it'S more relistic than any other game that tried
wipergone2, you need a lot of patience
time gate!
AdamTheDuck: manages to capture the survival feeling like no other
Dark_Horst, yes but that is ArmA in a nutshell.
GO JACK
Dark_Horst, not just Day Z.
dat stock pain
Athgaar: I dislike Yahtzee's
reviews
Come on, Jack.....
05Athgaar plase, everyone knows that yahtzee is but a comedian
not the bo staff!
You're gonna hate me for this, but I've never played a BF game, other than the 1942 demo. :$
Dat stock grunt
AdamTheDuck: so? dayz is tstill good
wish Black Ops 1 was dropped in price :S kinda annoying,borrowed it from my cousin and some of it is fun im liking the campaign
05pelase*
why don't they just run inside and funnel the statues through that small door
CountDoofus: wow... hahahaha
05doesnt mean he doesnt have valid poitns from time to time
08,01why the *fuck* do i have a sudden craving for treacle tart?
Dark_Horst, depends, some play like it at first then get annoyed and stop playing all together
klingons
Wrek: Ever since he talked SHIT about Nier
Dark_Horst, some end up liking the fustration.
nope, he stayed]
I stopped listening to him
08,01AJIsAwesome: treacle tart.
battle cry
Vordox: whts nier
AdamTheDuck: simple slution: be better than the other guys
08,01AJIsAwesome: you certainly may
fate of the world or two new friends?
wipergone2: Best game 2010
oh
that's why
08,01oni_link: it's a tart, made with treacle
when i wasa a kid, i didnt watch this because i thought it was too boring
Vordox: bullet hell?
Dark_Horst, that sounds simple until you meet a guy that has a gun and you don't.
wipergone2: Yes and no =P
:| that didnt help hahaha I'll just look it up
CupcakeWarrior I guess because there wasn;t as much talking
?
08,01oni_link: okay, y'know treacle?
yeah probably
Dark_Horst, there is no morality in Day Z. Everyone fights for themselves, I can't imagine real life being like that.
05CupcakeWarrior: and now you realized how wrong you were? :P
ahhh dammit I missede it'
08,01and you know tarts?
AdamTheDuck: so? that'S the game. you always have to expect loosing everything out of the blue. that'S what makes it interestig. if you cant handle loosing, dont play arma
or dayz
Vordox: trixle is powerful
Wrek: Of course :3
CupcakeWarrior: And now had you learned the error of your ways? :P
AdamTheDuck: the loose everything gameplay is the reason dayz became so successful
Dark_Horst, I never said I hated Day Z or ArmA, I actually quite enjoy it.
other games dont have that
Anyways. I'm about to upload my next comic :3
08,01AJIsAwesome: no, treacle
AdamTheDuck: i didnt imply you did
08,01AJIsAwesome: the stuff you get from sugar cane when you process it into white sugar?
thus his journey continues.....
Got to hand it to them, this show had balls
08,01you do know what sugar cane is, right?
05and for finisher of the jack segment
05a 2 parter
<-- Wrek If he went back in time, THEY WOULD NOT BE DEAD
derp
endless journey
08,01it's the brown bit of brown sugar
05while i finish my drinl
05k
i aku
AdamTheDuck: yeah, that'S a reoccurring problem. becasue,a fter all, it'S still a agme
And yes, I do know what sugar cane is. :)
2 parter? Well time to stop doing my homework.
08,01AJIsAwesome: no, golden syrup is completely different from treacle
You know if he took the portal then they never would have died either way
Dark_Horst, indeed.
so how many episodes are there in this?
AdamTheDuck: there's nothing of worth on the table for a digital bullet
also we learned that with minecraft
08,01for one, treacle is black, and golden syrup is golden
give the players the ability to be docuhebags and they will be just that
see ya guys later gotta go
Bye AssertiveFluttershy1
Bye AssertiveFluttershy1 :)
08,01AJIsAwesome: treacle is like the brown bit of brown sugar, but as a syrup
seeya AssertiveFluttershy1 :D
take care AssertiveFluttershy1
byye AssertiveFluttershy1
Cut half my little finger, used tape = Healed after 2 weeks
Half a pound of tuppany rice , half a pund of treacle , thats the way the melody goes , pop goes the weasle. Half a pound of heroin , half a pound of treacle , thats the way the story goes , out comes the evil!
I AM GOD
how can you undo sth that'll never happen when you prevent it?
bye AssertiveFluttershy1
08,01seriously, do you not get treacle in the US?
Bye AssertiveFluttershy1
ooh, this one
invi: time travel
Backstory episode
Ohai Invi :3
who listens to celstia radio
/me noms on Invi :3
Stan Lee? really?
odin?
Athgaar, yeah but can yur really undo sth that has never happened? ^^
hai thelonepony ^^
dat spiderpig
at least here
i've taken up the habit of shooting people on sight in dayz too. you just leanr that everyone you dont kill will kill you. liek that one time. there was another player with me in the school building, unamred. i even helped him, shot the uombies onj hs ass. 5 seconds later he killed me from behind with a crowbar he found
srlsy, odin?
*zombies
08,01huh
SLEIPNER
what's wrong with Odin?
does this show get an ending or did it get cancelled before they could end it?
*sleipnir
Dark_Horst, my point exactly, it's just shoot on sight in Day Z :/
08,01oooooooooh!
08,01it's called "molasses" in the US
Dark_Horst: Want me to use Swedish rogiinal word? :P
Dark_Horst, as a mod it's fun I guess, but I wanted a simulator.
AdamTheDuck: wasnt like that when the mod was still new, i beleive
molasses tart?
CupcakeWarrior they were gonna do a movie for a finale, but;s it's been in development hell for years
ive never tried molasses
wut, odin, y u no use odinforce!
Dark_Horst: that mod sounds fun, I gotta try it sometime. Is it true that disc copies of Arma 2 have a sticker on them that says you need it to play DayZ?
sorry but I'm gonna say ew to that one
AdamTheDuck: well, that'S as close as you will get. also, it IS a simulator
<-- Dat Gungnir :P
Dark_Horst It has gone that way since it became very popular but it has been more friendly but thanks to the enflux of COD kiddies and lord knows what else plus hackers which are common has made it like that
euifhikrmtgr45tg
r
rgergerg
erg
only way to get any closer to actual survival play is strap a rifle onto the palyers computer shat shoots him as son as his toon dies
is this Aku?
Probably
...
wtf
But I can get behind using Treacle instead
Aku is just a SMALL PIECE of his power?
05mhm
not the symbiote!
invi: yes, you're right, the concept of undoing something that never happens only makes sense in certain temporal models, namely those that imply that the timestream exists in a sort of "meta-time" because the writers couldn't wrap their heads around the inherent timelessness of existence outside time. In short, yeah, a valid question
Aku is all that remains
Treacle sounds like a pokemon :)
Maybe he's like Cell in that a small remaining pieece regenerated into the real deal again
It does :3
also
is killing floor fun
<--- now THAT's a story
COmpared to TTGLL

hey Cypresswolf
Hello AJ -how are you
Agreed, oni_link.
<--So Samurai Jack need to go back in the past BEFORE the dino died to stop Aku... LAWL nice going Jack
Why did they still live there?
Deoxso: it's Samurai Jack
hey Cypresswolf

I'm fine, Cypresswolf. HOw about you? :)
ohh ok
Hello Cypresswolf
Jack's mother!
how've you been Cypresswolf
jacks dad in action
The Emperor
dis gonna be good
lali-ho Cypresswolf and Deoxso
The Emprah!
You can see where Jack got his sense of duty
Hi Cypresswolf :)
Vordox my point was aku it's just but a piece of a bigger evil that was destined to bring the end of the world
dat beard
05actualyl not jacks parents
why does the stream cut off and make me refresh sometimes?
It would of makes a lot more sense if this episode aired first.
wonder if the animators had any deas behind his family crst
Wrek: they are so! stop lying
Haio Cypresswolf
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Aaaand what I read from the Google thing you said, had nothing to do, nor any connecton to shape size form or even the design itself to do with what we saw =P
Jack's ancestors then?
his parents' parents?
05something liek that
Deacon: Yup.
oh wow, i didnt realize the stream had watermarks now
AJIsAwesome: tired - started out slow and did nothing while we thought it was going to rain on us - ended up running 1000 ft of pipe altogether - 400 of 4 inch pvc
Vordox implying evil can't shape shift or present itself in any other forms
Cypresswolf: Oh, wow. :O
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Wrek: they certainly look the the ones in the spirit flashback thingie
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: So it would be same if I would have said Gigyas?
well... besides the hair
We saw Gigyas in the show?
Horse of the North Star
it's me or this spikes reminds me King Sombra?
wassup yall
Ugh... Having trouble naming my next comic... anyone feel like helping? :)
Michael: other way around, this was out WAY before then
Vordox more or less
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: so it was a joke for a reference... gotcha. :P
brb need more pizza
CountDoofus: What's it about?
Sooo
I have a question
ask
ask away
Go for it.
how do you reply to comments
time to check on my food, re-heating lasagna from yesterday and garlic bread (I love when my dad cooks)
yes
So...Jack is Professor Utonium's ancestor? :P
the thing i dont like about this show is that no one talks
type part of the name like nek then tab
aji: like this
nowm imagine all the corpses at the tips of those spires
All alone
AJIsAwesome: think that's something? Wait til we get to the part where the main power's going - that requires 6" pvc, and much longer :) multiply that by 2, and take account they have be 6 ft under all the way :) that'll run anyone ragged
no wait
CupcakeWarrior well it's trying more emphasis on action and visuals
05thats cool and all
but that's fine
Cypresswolf: WOW. :O
05BUT WHAT ABOUT CHINICHI?
the bravest dog to wander the earth
Chinichi?
Wrek: Chinichi...will lives.
aji: how about now
Chinichi will be doing all the digging :)
Wrek: We'll get you a new Chinichi
that horse has no hooves.....

Did the episode explain wht those green things are?
AM
AKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
so....Aku was a tree....
^
Deacon: Must be the polar opposite of Fluttertree
Metronome: what green things? Oh the stuff he shot into the pond? A poison
aku/fluttershy. fo it
*do
then that means Exdeath is truely evil
NO AKU IS NOT FLUTTERSHY
Deacon: the first fluttertree
Oh, nice going, Jack's father, you ACCIDENTALLY created the shapeshifting master of darkness.
Deacon, an evil tree
Fluttershy be jealous of Aku's MAD TREE SKEELZ
Aku is best tree
VenHur: don't forget the Shogun of Sorrow
uguuuuuuuuuuuughughguhuh
THAT WAS A GOOD NAP
now remember, Aku is just a TINY TINY part of a much GREATER evil
I think it's because they can't deal with what people do. Like the other day when I was playing black ops 2 with my friend he said. "Oh wow. That guy has a ted emblem."
i love akus design, looks badass xD
/me 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck!

otakon: one would have to conduct research
A WII MINI
your mom is a Wii
I like how the gods didnt help jack after here and let aku take over the world

Vordox: that's been done
Why Nintendo

Metronome: THIS is what they did, they're busy still fighting the HUGE EVIL
hi fluttertree

Sleipnir
but the big evil was annihilated
CrystalPhoenix: ONly more succesful.
didn't you see the first part
Buytoast: it comes back
08,01Dark_Horst: can any self respecting furry honestly tell you, looking straight in your eye and from the bottom of his heart, that he has never wanted to get jiggy with a dolphin?
wii mini... wat?
Buytoast: it alway comes back
Dolphins don't have fur
Vordox: also, wrek usually draws femal pon... r64 sleipnir! that'S IT!
oni_link: it's a smaller Wii system, think like the PS1 redesign
08,01magmablock: a mere technicality!
I agree with magmablock
05... you weirdos
ever since i played Echo the Dolphin, i knew my destiny was to pork them porpoises

/me This isn't even Aku's final form
yeah, you feel that, dontcha princess?
how've you been _Princess_Woona_
RaveBrony: hmm good point but you'll see

That was close.
CupcakeWarrior: he doesnt win
God how many fucking forms does this bastard have?
VenHur: if she'd been watching, she would've taken off at the start of the shaolin ep xD
The only good spider is one who is currently eating a fly, or dead.

Wait, so is Jack fighting Aku (I think thats the monsters name...) or not? I was gone for a while..

Pshh, its clearly his mother, DUH

O_O
Metronome jacks dad would be long dead where jack is
Then I serioused
05i can use the same argument that his fatehr doesnt look like his father, hecneforth istn jacks parents
i think the slight difference in appearance simply stems from them both being older in jakc'S spirit flashback
05but his anscestors
ATTACK! :[
05jsut as valid as "it looks like his mother"
Wrek: you know what? I'll just go get photos hold on

Wrek: Aaaaiieee! You're making my head hurts!
He needs to use the spinning cyclone attack
Where the hell did all thise armor come from?
05also thats not really aku
SpadeMagnes[School]: Fallen warriors.
honestly, it's likely it isn't his father because the empire isn't in fucking ruins when his father is around
Hold B to charge your sword

nice bag of holding
the only fun thing about WoW these days are Monks
now those are fun
how deep is that sack?
I have fun as a paladin
But yea Monks are fun
While I am just a brony I find it rather phony To love all of the ponies in the show I have my one pony, don't think that I will ever need Other ponies to make my life complete There is one pony I care for I know she would be there for me Twilight Sparkle, my one and only Like a book on your shelf, I would never get lonely You taught me what true love was like (My one and only) You know I
want to be your Spike (I'd do anything for you) I love you more, than you could know No other pony will I clop to, no way Twilight Sparkle, my one and only Like a book on your shelf, I would never get lonely And though you're only in a show I hope that you could know You'll be my one and only Forever Forever
i mean yeah cupcakes is bad but it intoduced me into mlp so i really thank that fanfic lol
suddenly Snake
Wrek: Wasn't there ONE episode where Aku was...nice?

Cypresswolf: updraft was too strong
How is Pandaria? I really don't want to get sucked into WoW again, but temptation is getting hard to resist.
it's eh
My tv keeps playing the 1-800-contacts comercial
I like Pandaria
I heard that WoW started to sucks when the Wrath Of The Lich King was released.
Monks are pretty fun and the music is really good
THUD
but other than that its meh
lol
I liked WotLK
not suspicious at all
Cata trashed it
SpadeMagnes[School]: The overdramatic one?
The new loot system for LFR sucks
Buytoast: I have fun on my hunter. But my hunter is a 7 foot tall wolf-woman who willingly wears a mailokini-styled armor. And is PROUD of it.
VenHur: I thought that was one of the best expansions according to my friends
Kencolt: ... you dirty old man :P
SpadeMagnes[School]: i once watched 5 hours of 1-800 comeercials :I
hell, i might even replace my shaman with my monk
/me has never played WoW or plans to
and i've been a shaman since BC
so in WoW what do monks do
RUN!
Buytoast: And otakon -- bvecause I freaking CAN.
I heard of better MMOs, like Star Wars: The Old Republic, and Star Trek Online, DC Universe...and so fourth.
LOL
Kencolt: lol I know
Oh please...didnt SWOR tank?
SpadeMagnes[School]: that's why it's F2P now
It is F2P now
just saying
I would get it if my PC could run it
celestia is trying to murder jack
LASERS!
I got Guild Wars 2, but not too overly fond of it.
DEADLY LASERS!
uhh
I think the writers were on some sort of zelda marathon when they wrote this
Deadly rays
Kencolt: what the hell is mailokini styled armor?
YokusaHHart: IKR
bad Celestia! dont kill Jack
Not to sound like a WoW eliteist but everything seems to try to copy wow
google doesnt know that word
Why do I have the feeling Jack is trolling... someone?
Dark_Horst: think bikin but chainmail
<--- Woulnd't the gold...melt?
ah
an solar death ray sphere, how delicious
Vordox: Magic
take that princess celestia!
EAR RAPE (im wearing hedphones)
BAH
With wimsy?
Vordox: magic
Dark_Horst: Look up Magahowl on the WoW armory and see. Spent more than a bit of gold keeping that look up.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Nah its just MMOs have a very bland formula. Meet a person, collect x amount of droppable items, get to this place, kill that guy. and it keeps repeating
what happened? i was afk.
Except for me, WoW keeps me interested
mawage
SOmehow
oni_link: Guild Wars 2 is better
MAWAGE IS WHAT BRINGS US TOGETHA
mako is such a cool voice actor

*think
otakon: gotta try GW2
I think he knew
Deacon: he's very trusting
although WoW is on its last legs lore wise becuase they've had to start making new stuff

Aku is best villian

Kencolt: well screw me, appearatnly i forgot my account iformation xD
Getting loot in LFR is fucking impossible

Dark_Horst: Can't help you there. But you can google Magahowl-- apparently it's a totally unique name on all servers.
people who dont deserve it get it
<--- now I know why Aku is slow
TREE
Buytoast: The article about the new system said as I saw, EVERYONE GETS A EQUAL CHANCE AT LOOT
Hey there, Panda :)
Bull shit!

MLP_Brovakiin, AJIsAwesome, I got wind of a stream... but... perhaps I was late for the arts?
Did aku just drop the f bomb?
And you wont get the same gear you already have, and I got a cloak,used a coin, got the same cloak
and hello RaveBrony ^^
Panda: You were. :<
SO LIES
AJIsAwesome, did he finish?
Kencolt: ah, found it
Bronysith eh, all he did was shifted the continents around a bit, no one, (except that one villaged) died from it
Kill him, Aku!

Dark_Horst: And why not taqke advantage of them? (Freaks the orcs out no end.)
nope.

Im so fucking confused how Aku lived
[Enginer nope face]
SpadeMagnes[School]: well he has to be either absorbed intot he sword OR completely cleaved not a single piece can survive or he'll just regenerate

SuperBrony64 doesn't play gamecube games, no thanks

LyraHeartstrings: Painttool SAI
/me holds Scoot-Scootaloo back
Scoot-Scootaloo and Wrek is best pony.
I have one question
hai tehlonpon :3
05how about some techno to fit vinyl eh?
btw the console does not support wifi connection and it doesnt has gamecube compability so no big deal
How much would a in good condition Wind Waker Disc go for?
SUre, Wrek. :)
And Wrek's hands are like... 5 little unicorn horns
On the Xbox version of Dishonored - You cannot blow up the leaking whale oil storage tank in the Flooded District :( - Makes no sense! It's flammable for chaos sake :|
Wrek, sure thing :)
SpadeMagnes[School]: 20 bucks
thanks, cause im looking into drawing ponies myself :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: I'm confused. How exactly would my comic contain spoilers?
Hey yo wuts up everypony:) awww yea Wrek stream:)
I doubt its that cheap
I fail at drawing ponies D:
05i give the best
Wrek: INB4 rage because apparantly Vinyl only does dubstep
05this is live techno boys
SpadeMagnes[School]: $25-30, maybe
what's up scout19_tf2
Cypresswolf, still disappointed over no explosion? :$
LyraHeartstrings: I hope you do, drawing ponies is fun and addicting
Because no one wants to read canon things before the whole story is out , CountDoofus :P
oni_link: I don't see her as just a dubstep DJ.
What about Kirby Air Ride?
Err.. it make more sense in my head...
AdamTheDuck: :S yeah....
AJIsAwesome: thats good. alot of people in the fandom don't agree though
SpadeMagnes[School]: OMG DAT GAME
Deacon: just waiting fer da weekend:)
i dont see her as dubstep or electronic dj
right now im trying to learn how to use gimp so i can draw ponies
I still have the disc in good contition
Wrek: You call this Techno?
scout19_tf2 aren;t we all :D
I'm... still confused. But, if you say no, I won't argue :p
I'm drawing fail ponies on Paint.
she never plays dubstep or electronic in the series so HA IN YOUR FACE FANDOM
AdamTheDuck: but there's a PC version - There better be a Mod where you can blow it up!
cachi01: indeed XD
Cypresswolf, this is why I love PC :3
:p
Deacon: yea pretty sure 100% of chat is waiting
11,02Apparently the Wii Mini won't be able to hook up online...
Its lame allready
05Vordox: yes
oni_link: I understand where they're coming from, but I see her as doing other styles of music besides JUST dubstep. I mean, I don't have a problem with her being a dubstep DJ, it's just that I see her doing more than just that as well.
05i call this proper techno
SuperBrony64: yeah no online and no gamecube
SuperBrony64 and it's canada exclusive
SuperBrony64: and canada only
can you play RainbowDash Presents:Rainbow Factory
SuperBrony64: and lacks backwards compatibility
Well now I dont care
Wrek: I'm not sure I can call this Techno, or proper, it's more like...
...
SuperBrony64::'(
wtf is that genre
BlackRose: he is drawing atm
11,02But...I want it now for some reason O.o
i know after
Why the fuck did Nintendo take out the gamecube compatability for the wii?
I guess because they're getting rid of those services the online wii games, maybe...
AJIsAwesome: me too. I mean a DJ in my eyes isn't supposed to stick to one style anyways
SuperBrony64: What does it do? Is it just a mini Wii?
SuperBrony64: yeah it looks cool but its lame so noo dont do it lol
BlackRose: Technically, it's Rainbow Dash Presents Captain Hook the Biker Gorilla
oni_link: Agreed.
SuperBrony64: because its nintendo. RESIST!!!
AJIsAwesome: yep
SpadeMagnes[School] because majority of consumers don't know you can also play gamecube games in the first place
theres a original one lol
I saw the best thing in a toy magazine
AJIsAwesome: but no internet and no backwards compability
A sega genesis with 8- games
*80
cachi01: WHAT? :S
I am so getting that thing
eeyup
SpadeMagnes[School]: Im interested :o
I'm going to make another few runs through Dishonored, then go back to playing Red Dead Redemption - havent played that in a couple years, left off on a mission in Mexico where you're to steal a train or something
SpadeMagnes[School]: holy shit how much?

It has all the genesis games
SpadeMagnes[School]: i had one of those the controller looked like a sonic face
I saw the sonic games,
There was an atari one for some reason
AJIsAwesome I think it's a pirate
SpadeMagnes[School]: but its not the genesis. its ot the same
dat backround music:D
But who the hell would want that?
Deacon: Ah, okay. I see what you mean.
after this you should play Rainbowdash Presents Captain hook the biker gorilla
SpadeMagnes[School]: the genesis toy i had has 40 games
AJIsAwesome a well polished pirated console though
SpadeMagnes[School]: 18 dollars i think
This Sega genesis I saw has 80
I dont have more than 5 games to myself for Xbox - RDR, Skyrim, Fable Journey, LFD2, and Kung Fu Panda that came with the system

RDR <3

SpadeMagnes[School]: yep
SpadeMagnes[School]: Yeah, I think with the E.T. game
Fable Journey was pretty good, like the story line - can't wait for Fable 4 :) Darn shame I have to wait at least anothe year
We should stream E.T :P
OH GODS NO
scout19_tf2: might do PF2 not sure which server. add me! look for _oni_link_
ugh
SpadeMagnes[School]: well it wasnt all ataris falut people back then stole other peoples games and put a new label over it
oni_link: u mean tf2
it was E.T., plus the lackluster games that were on in, heck, there was even a dog food company that made a game on the atari
I have to do this stupid multi-media report on the cold war...
scout19_tf2: yeah but I might play on the PF2 servers
and E.T was like the stake in the coffin
not sure which ones though
so E.T did fuck up the gaming indestrie
E.T. is one of the worst games ever............but it fucking printed money in its time
oni_link: kks:)
And R.O.B recovred the industry
:P
05Vordox: still doubt me?
no it didn't
Skyrim I havent played since summer - I love that game - the glitches are fun <3
Wrek: About?
Good old R.O.B
but thats why we have japan to back us up...
:D
LOL ==> R.O.B <== LOL
this drawin again
R.O.B is best pony
Not to mention Daikatana. Fail game as well.
good as a toy. horrible as gaming companion
the funny thing about the E.T. game, the producers made double the copies than atari systems because they belived everyone would buy it twice
Deacon: and they were right
Hey he salvaged the gameing industry, cut him a break
http://i.imgur.com/26hqR.jpg
my neighbor I let borrow the game, got a dragon glitch where the animation stopped - it just floated around in the sky, never attacked, never landed
Cypresswolf: write a creepypasta about that
dat goggle texture
Confound these ponies. They wont GET OFF MY PLANE!
hey may u put this up on a pic site so i can use it as a spray on tf2
Wrek: You mean the current music is techno? :P
I thought it hilarioius - as for a creepy pasta....I dont think you want to read anything my depraved mind can conjure up
need to play tf2
Eventually I'm going to have to figure out what to do with all the fucking Gamecube games I have
05ofc
Cypresswolf: You'd be suprised, the internet could eat it up
SpadeMagnes[School] insulation
SpadeMagnes[School]: give them to meeee
Cypresswolf: yess i want lol
im in need of gc games
so do i
I already got metroid prime 1 and 2, that's pretty much it
VEGGIE SALAD
One of my stories - a writing assinment in my early college years was about an author who wrote snipits of stories, but none were finished - I chose one about a mysterious rug - I turned it into a demonic thing - first eating the pets of the household's new ownder - one part invovled the owners finding their missing cat's severed front paws at the edge of the rug
dat wall
i only have megaman x collection...

Hey Wrekie's streaming! :D

This is Wrekie right?
whitney houston? i havent seen make a new song in years...
donutpop365: aye it's the Viking
donutpop365: Yes, yes it is
haseo348: you know she's dead right?
WHAT???
donutpop365, no this is Patrick
yeah
I kinda got the idea from a Dr Seuss book I remember as a kid - I think I called it "Bug Under the Rug" - cant remember the title of it, it was about a boy taking you on a tour of his house, and mentions on one page the thing he's most afraid of is the bug under the rug :)
otakon: NOOOOOO
she passed on a while back
poor whitney houston:'(
haseo348 yea sadly
I'm certain of it
Will always be impressed, Wrek you work insanely fast :O
The story I called "Bug Under the Rug"
lol jk yeah i know...its a tradegy
If my dream of being a game programmer doesnt work out, I could always try voice acting, I can mimic voices pretty well
its funny because every time i go to school i pass by where she died....
Does it smell like weed?
not really that funny
speed painting im guessing
Hi everypony!
rainbow: Real-time painting
haseo348: must of been a depressing walk to school

Kawaii_icybeauti: Lucky you! :O
THere's a bit of snow here

SpadeMagnes[School]: We have quite a bit of snow :D
3
I used to read A LOT of scary stories when I was little :D scared myself on more than enough occasions, I can tell you - slept with a bat in my hand most nights - turning the light off required planning - how to make it back to the safety of the bed, without getting grabbed by the creatures in the darkness :P
FAIL
it never snows in california...
Well, not much, but still, I didn't have to go through a 2 hour practice today, so I'm happy.

She's looking lovely Wrek ^_^
That reminds me of a book I never was able to find in my yourh - it was an encyclopedia of sorts about all manner of creatures - werewolves, banshees, vampires, etc
Kawaii_icybeuti: oh well i live in nd and sometimes it goes to may:D
L_Y_R_A: Woah, let's ease on the insults...

It is indeed looking amazing Wrek.

Buytoast: pandaria bad?

Hey, can soemone tell me the name of the video that was abridging that anime, the one where they say "Stop startin!"
Is it bad that the when I saw book about vampires I immediately thought Twilight?
this new patch
they keep kicking shamans in the balls
Cypresswolf, pfft, we're all weird here on BronyState :P
Kawaii_icybeauti: Evangelion One-shot. :)
thank you!
Buytoast: to be fair, they were completely overpowered in vanilla XD
I shall see this "monster" with my own eyes
now they've made it so people can completely stop you from using your totems
ALL MY MINNESOTANS!!!!
And I never use totems Im a fucking Paladin
dat bass
ALL MY MINNESOTANS SAY YEAHHHHH

but the shaman master radce is suffering
*silence*
HAEY YAS SNATOSENNIM YM LLA
but monks are still OP
:D And don't get me started on R L Stein's Goosebump series - lets just say I've read Every. Single. One. :)
Arent the new expansion class always over powered?
NEIGH
Cypresswolf: I considered reading them, but I never could find the time. :)
Wrek, your OC has Ai or Adobe Illustrator for its CM, but you work in Sai yes? Sometimes in Ai?
NEIGH... I mean, if its okay with you...
aye?
Wreeeeeek
Scoot-Scootaloo: That's a bit mean. :<
I'm trying to have fun here.
AJIsAwesome: Wait... I'm nice?
The only change I have a issue with is the fact my jugement no longer gives me mana when I use it
YNOP STEB SI YPRED
AJIsAwesome: As long as it involved spookyness, I loved reading as a kid :)
Shizuka, shizumobile are you the same? Two accounts, or actually different?
You just told L_Y_R_A to ease up on the insults and now you're insulting me.
*tseb
Murrikans can't hae fun, we're Murrkikan!
lrn2whois
lol
I'mm Minnesotan first.
So my only reliable mana regen is meleeing mobs
You know who else is Minnesotean? Kim Jung-Il
shizumobile: Got it, same.

Wrek: Ai CM? Use or used to use Illustrator of Sai?
Its all good homie
MUXIKO >_>
instead of*
Why would I kick myself? I like being here.
Random thought - Anyone remember the movie Tom & Huck with Jonathon Taylor Thomas? I've always wondered, but never found out, the story the character Muff Potter, played by Michael McShane, told that endend with "All of them were dead, and all of them.....were smiling"
Again only paladin change I dislike is the fact my judgement cant be used to help regen mana
Wreeeeek, vivi's mane? :3

Scoot-Scootaloo, I cant even get the log-on button up.
now that u talkin bout DK counttry Canadian_Brony i think i need to get back to playing DKC3
BlazeAngel: have you tried plugging your computer into the power outlet?
What about uninstalling/installing it?
Bronysith, HMMMMMMM
Speaking of DKC, I still need to beat DKC Returns. I love that game.
but im too lazy to turn on my snes :I
AJIsAwesome beat it, still trying to wrap it
Scoot-Scootaloo, tryed that too, I did just about every logical option.
I need to 100% that game
.
i still need to beat DKC 3
What is this music???
AJIsAwesome in order to truely wrap DKC Returns, you need to beat it 200%
I wanna know :3
I kid you not
All I need to do is beat Mirror Mode and Time Trial, but they're very difficult. :D
donutpop365: techno, apparently.
Canadian_Brony, so play it twice 100%?
CountDoofus: Is it not more house techno ish?
BlazeAngel basically, yes. Get through all the Golden Temples and do it again in Mirror Mode.
Eerrr sorta...
BlazeAngel: you have to use the force
ehrmagerd mirror modes r mah wurst enemie
Canadian_Brony: Mirror mode confused me beyond beleif. It surprised me actually.
Dunno. I dislike genre names. All I care about is if I like it or not, no matter what style of music ;)
^
CountDoofus: :D
sounds like asian music.[or at least foreign]
nope
Asian? .-.
Nope. Techno music.
What makes you think that?
=_=
it just seems different
/me starts to say a certain saying, while someone in the distace trains their sights on me. "All people are equal, but some peop-*BOOM HEADSHOT*
butler: have you ever heard asian music?
You mean it differentiaites from the usual techno you've heard?
*differentiates
no
this sounds nothing like asian music
/me hides his rifle
sorry
What pack is has he downloaded to add on to his program?
o.o
/me pulls the bullet out of his neck, choking on his own bloo- Oh. I can't roleplay. SORRY LOLLOL but really, Im not supposed to.
Zacklego: what?
Then again, he IS Swedish...
There are mulitiple classifications for Techno. Dubstep, , EMD, and Trance are the ones that I seem to find a lot of.
He has far more tools than the standard program. What has he added on there?\
You see what I did there, BlazeAngel?
Drum N' Bass and Trance, too. :)
Kandarihu: Eh, yeah.
sumi
ca
tfish
Light RP is okay, iirc. It's when it gets intensive, or disturbing when it's a problem. Right?
somethin' like that yeah
Yep, Kandarihu. :)
It's usually discouraged here, since it tends to get that way sometimes.
Kandarihu: yep. for example there are some guys with names like _Scootaloo_ and they start acting like if they were the character
actually that happened yesterday lol
I Love me some Vinyl Scratch :)
tl:dr
Kandarihu: lol that would be cool
err

you get some shit where you tote garrrosh around and get a new town built and stuff
Ah Vale of eternal blossoms and enternal fps lag

Wrek: Your picture is turning out AWESOME.

/me I can't believe I'm going to miss Shizustream...
SpeccyRush: I'm not pandering, I was asking what she was streaming. Besides I can pander if I want
Shizuka: (Cue Thriller Dance) Cause this is FILLER....FILLER time....an hour and a half is just too short for a rifftrax.....WHOO HOO
lol

ah the intro, it has begun
otakon: for me it is. it's so funny i can't get enough of it
Well, my days start early. Enjoy shizustream everyone

otakon: point taken.........but i wanted to change the ''an hour and a half is just too long for uncreative minds'' whoo hoo
Haibane Renmei? where hae I ...
I honestly wouldn't mind Rifftrax of Batman Forever, since I saw it already and it's terrible anyway
OH THE ONE WITH THE WINGS

Dark92Enigma: eeyup

Ponies47: how old?
Dark92Enigma: 15 :P
Oh well. I'm not paying enough attention to this anyway. I've been thinking I should just try downloading the episodes I missed in the session so I can be in continuity again.

at the tacher
they were smoking
Ponies47: you're younger than i thought :D
Ponies47: i thought you were my age (20)
oh and i still cant find a name for your OC, sorry Ponies47 :/
wait
all haibane just grow from cocoons suddenly?
Dark92Enigma: I get that alot. My voice is really deep. So it makes me sound older. If you have ever played TF2 with me you would've most likely heard it
spontaneous generation
oookay
BlackRose: you know......no, i shouldn't joke on this anime, since i'm starting it
So it's a people egg.
I guess so.
eeyup
BlackRose: i was about to say ''You know....for (....)...'' you know it
thelonepony: I can't think of anything either. I was just thinking of calling him Forty Seven. But nah. Gotta get more creative
so she's in the egg
...
Eggceptional observation.
shes in the cacoon
Ponies47: shame, even though i get all of the TF2 references i never got the chance to play it
gotta go, my mom wants her PC back, bye
welp by Dark92Enigma
Ponies47: could of call him crimson forty-seven, but its stupid, i know

Shizuka: Duct tape fixes everything, ask the Minmatar :)
wat is this magic
otakon: just got that -__-
whats this?
okay how come her wings didn't grow in the cocoon?
13wait
Duck tape, wire, and headban for halo, they will never know

I thought you already explained!

Prince_Lightstar: I disagree, hate it
Well thos're ugly looking.

OH GOD, KILL IT WITH FIRE
13just wait

looks painful to be a angel
That is gonna hurt like HELL when they pop out
BOAT
otakon: its a good game once u get the hang of it
Also, thanks for clearing that up, Shizuka.
whats the name of this anime?
wow that don't look good
woah

There'll be blood and gore EVERYWHERE when they pop through the skin
Seriously. ._.
http://www.ravestats.com/public/fen/faction-fleet-tempest-3.jpg -- Tempest Fleet Issue (Minmatar ship) Uses lots of duct tape
I dont wanna become an angel now ._.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Haibane Reimei
otakon ah whats it about?
Those aren't going to pop they're going to explode.
CriticKitten: we have a spoiler
If this is what it takes to become an angel then fuck that shit.
13CriticKitten: don't spoil for ponies if you've seen this
Prince_Lightstar: That'd be impressive since I've never seen this show before
Sketch_Toku_Brony: no idea, all we know is some girl fell threw the sky and then ended up in a cocoon
so they're not human
and now I'm getting stutter
otakon huh that makes sense :D
Well they have wings and halos
"Nobody knows what we are." You have white feathered wings, golden halos and you're all girls. The FUCK do you THINK you are?!!
Theory is they're dead.
wow....that bucks!
But I'm assuming they aren't just gonna magically pop out and glow all pretty
Hrrm

Thats it Im becoming a demon, Im not going through this shit :P
Skizuka: Mother of God...
Shizuka: ONE?! How many episode are there? :O
Though, I am surprised. That wasn't as much blood as I expected.
1313
Major: you'll get bat wings
13half season series
That looks like it's pushing the blood back into the wings
what happened to her hand?
Please tell me this is the only episode of this anime you're showing tonight.
Considering how massive those wings were when they popped out, there probably should've been a lot more blood. O.o
nope
charcoal grey is beautiful?
Hi guys :)
13reki fell off a step stool scrambling for first aid kit
Shizuka: ah thanks
Fuck you otakon, they are.
still not nearly is bbloody as the first few minutes of the first ep of elfen lied
Fuck
otakon: She wrapped it in gauze for the girl to bite down on so that she could go through the pain easieer.
/me throws a Twi plushie into the chat

O_O
:D
twilight_sprinkle: But that's not much of a fair standard
now what's happening...
Wait, did his wings shrink?
They were HUGE before.
otakon... skype
"Ring"? It's a halo, you dumb bitch.
Panda2: okay
XD
13hm, the wing sprouting i could handle, but mess up my hair? i think not!
mah cat is attackin mah dog
Shizuka: IKr? :D
Shizuka, that is only because you are female.
Nopony messes up Shizu's mane.
CriticKitten: not a standard, just saying theres a lot worse out there

That's not even long enough to take a piss.
Finally a fucking intermission@
Well since that was an episode 1, maybe I will get lucky with what is next
hey Every Pony! what are we watching?
So Shizu, is that all the blood for this series, or are we to be treated to a lot more wings bursting out of people's backs in a furious blood spray?

New Rozen Maiden anime next year
13what, episode 4?
Actually, does anyone else want to play Torchlight II with us?
And now for something completely different.
Bigger questing parties are more fun.
Reikim: Sure.
I've read the first manga volume of this. Me likey.
^
bye guys :) time to watch a WiiU unboxing video
idk what this is about, but i aint passin up a chance to spam. DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU FUN FUN FUN FUN
Just got announced earlier this week
Fuck this shit, I'm OUT!
i'll be back soon :)
CriticKitten: Add me on Steam. I'm using this nick for my Steam username.
I never watch this, but I know Desu comes from this :)
I've never played before though, so hopefully I won't drag the group down much.
Sorry Rei, I never bought I-Wish-I-Was-Diablo 2.
DESU
Rozen Maiden is good too
SUISEISEKI
Not as good as Haibane, but few things are
onnichan!
'S okay, Critic. We just started too.
So how much anime has been shown so far tonight?
Reikim: Found ya, invite sent.
man, thats fancy
13i completely ruined this series for myself by using the OST as oblivion/morrowind music
First time watching this. Hm.
13it sticks out so much now
My favorite anime film of all time is Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise.
^
LadyCanary... omg... you are missing the desu
Shizuka: What have you shown so far tonight?
Shizuka: :D
Shizuka: ikr, i made the mistake of playing skyrim with mlp background music
13just haibane 1 and now this
good
I've done something similar, Shizuka. I often play DOOM with Pony music in the background.
I watched the anime of that for a while, LadyCanary. Was sorta weird.
13debating pulling down haruhi from my archives while this runs
I suppose I logged in at a good time, huh? :)
the flcl anima and manga are soooooo good:)
Shizuka: it's out there enough for this lot
Do it Shizu
Haruhi?! YES, PLEASE
13elfen lied is off the table for a while
But the anime was just...too much fanservice. At least in the manga there was a good bit of fanservice here and there, but the anime just took it like any other cookie cutter anime.
I've never seen Rozen Maiden.
Shizuka: they won't be able to take it
Chiiiii?
LadyCanary: The anime took out a lot of the fighting I heard too
The doll moved! Its Goosebumps all over again :O
Yeesh, even as a male. I'm kind of iffy on fanservice :|
CLANNAD HO MAH GAWD YES!!!
Clannad is the best anime EVER.
Clannad? Sure, why not?
13dubbed though
We managed that bloomin' movie last week, what was it called, the one with the zombies.
is the stream playing anything?
13not *terrible* but it's no bebop
Oh God, no dubs.
I can't stand the Clannad dub.
...GOD NOT CLANNAD
;3;
fail
I'm afraid I would be too used to the Japanese version :S
I generally like dubs, but the Clannad dub is unbearable.
CriticKitten: I created a server. It's called Bronystate. Password is "ottercan".
/me giggles
Shizuka: Only a few dubs are Bebop quality, FMA, Black Laggon, feel like I am forgetting a big one
Okee. Installing atm, should hopefully be pretty quick.
13ghost in the shell
Hmm, not so fast Kaiba-boy!
Or One Piece, for that matter
LadyCanary, THE FEELS!
Floats in the Gel.
13my parents don't believe me that kids like jun are common in japan
card games on motorcycles.......
Jun?
Boast in the Bell
Which is why I don't buy Sentai Filmworks' crap.
Sign here as well
Jun-kun~
13toast in a well
Still gone. And I have zero interest in this series anyway.
the anima and manga of flcl is good
I know, but...
13tiny plot hole here... where exactly is he getting the money to order all this stuff
Hmm...
The dub is just so... >_<
13IT STARTS... oblivion town music here..
....internet?
In my mind, it's the most blatant violator of my robot-girls taboo. So bah
"No you don't have to pay anything." Sounds legit.
the anima and manga of flcl is good
Oh dear
Cursed doll? Gimmie!
FLCL is GAINAX's second-best work. Best is Gurren Lagann.
Host in the Mail? :)
So. What do you mean, kids like Jun?
This kid is weird.
13Polydunami: hikikomori, he never leaves the house
13not for school or anything
brb
Jun-kun~
Yes, I was
Oh yeah, that character -_(\
I was thinking that.
haventseen gurren lagann
13from oblivion i could probably hum most of these background musics .-.
Jun has bad hikikomori, it is actually a solid plot point
Shizuka, you could just use the term "shut-in". It works as well as "hikikomori".
tentacoos!
maxx: ahum.... WATCH IT
13it's more specific afaik
I watched Ano Hi Mita Hana... blah blah blah. Long-ass name :S
....those glasses. O.o
Polydunami: Best show since TTGL
I recognize this music
?
xxxHOLIC so good
School?! GTFO!
So where are their parents?
13and some of the music probably leaked into a music stream at some point or another
xxxHolic is good, stinks I liked the dub
/me pings Panda2
Because that kid needs a good kick in the ass.
Wait until the lolis- er, I mean, Rozen Maidens come in. Shit gets crazy.
DeathStar? yeah hun?
Oh dear
Ah, here come sone now.
DE
DON"T OPEN IT YOU IDIOT!
Shinku is a b****
SU
:O
YOU BAKA!~
13there's some good feels in this series, some bad feels, and a good amount of slapstick once multiple maidens arrive
He now has a pedoboner.
13and of course desu
._.
what the hell
Anyway, I've not been on Bronystate very much lately.
Pretty dollie.
Also, What the hell is going on?
Now thats is a very big doll
oh god
not really
...
Polydunami: stuff
Stop fondling it, pervert.
creepy
im kind of just as clueless as you
OH GOD
otakon.... dat you?
oh shit its weeeeeeeeeegeeeee:[
13wind... wind.... KILL ALL HUMANS
That thing is a bit TOO real looking. Those sorts of dolls creep me out.
Panda2: no it's Eleanor Roosevelt
someone hold me..
especially since i just dont watch alot of anime to begin with
http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/DeeKayL/1258753512287.gif
He just screwed a doll, teehee.
and am therefore not on stream
It moved, quick, throw it.
This is actually pretty funny here
and then it punches him
Dang its brok- OMG ! Its alive :O
Why did that remind me of when Negi cranked Chachamaru? .////.
someone hold me ;_;
CREEPY!
ieve seen enough horror movies
13shinku is not amused
RAPE
DESU
RUN!
...
kick its ass
.....RUN!
kick
O_O
Bap.
the desu comment is more disturbing.
And that is why they creep me out.
Okay, that was cute.
AHHHHHHHHHHH
... Desu?
dat bitch slap :D
WUT
oh shit
He was never heard from again
lol that was the weakest slap ever
13Panda2: desu doesn't kick in for a few more eps
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
run its madd
I know Shizuka, preemptive if anything.
he didn't feel you up
:O The toys are alive *cowers*
although he did peek at your undies
Hmm... I recognize Shinku's VA...
...oh hes alive, its not a blood thirsty doll after all.....dang movies lied to me
otakon, to your standards~
incoming desu t minus... whenever
13the dub of this featured most of the tachikoma VAs
You spun her right 'round, baby, right 'round.
wow, fast delivery service
Something tells me that Jun's trash can is filled with jizzwipes.
13Darf14: ohhh just wait :3
help
?
13well... actually you'll probably have to wait a while, i forget if suiseiseki arrives the same way in the first season as she does the second
Slap
Bap.
XD
Is this Desu the anime?
and I'm back :)
lol reminds me of Dr Maki w/ his creepy doll from OOO :D
Wait, desu? The famed desu?
13anyway at least in the second season, suiseiseki (aka desu spam) arrives by crashing her doll box through the window and smacking him in the head
13CLOWNS
I need to try that. Whenever a human picks me up, just a light paw slap. "You are carrying me incorrectly."
...CLOWNS
OH GOD THE CLOWN
DESTROY US ALL
Pennywise?
DESTROY US ALL
i need to be held now :<
Don't worry, I have tangelos. Clowns hate tangelos.
13his window needs repair like once an episode
It's... a clown.
Pfft.
/me holds aniderp1
A random clown doll appears! Run, Fight, Item, Pokem- err I mean Doll
"It's regretable, but you're going to die."
The manga really makes you forget exactly how small the Maidens really are.
13clown is secretly gambit
Meanwhile: EVERYTHING FLOATS...if its density is lees than or equal to the volume of water :D
yay other me pinged out
Have you seen Traumend Shizuka
The anime makes it more noticeable.
13yep have that in archive too
OH ****! That Clown doesnt buck around! :O
MY DAD WAS RIGHT!
What did you think of the end?
Okay, now he's just taunting Jun.
/me faints
Damn, Yu-Gi-Oh players are really hardcore nowadays
Gambit the Clown
AW SHIT, NIGGER.
CLOWNS ARE SCARY AS HELL!
13this and haibane i've only gone through once though, haibane cause the end is a tearjerker and this because i ruined the music with oblivion
so swear allegiance to a doll
This is why I dont own clown dolls :O
or die
fuck you clown!
Kiss my hand
/me slaps aniderp around a bit with a large trout
yeah GREAT FUCKING CHOICE
13otakon: it's srs bns, you'll see
jaymoo ;_;
thats right, kiss my wring
OMG, it's rozen maiden!
(For the record, no, I am not racist. I just find the word "nigger" to be funny in some cases.)
:3
this pleases the don
Toys are serious buisness.
Suddenly magic
Seriously he's swearing allegiance TO A WIND UP DOLL!
13done pulling haruhi from archive, need to look up which ep is first chronologically though
Magic. *snort snort*
^
And now Jun is married.
13otakon: just wait
13in this ep, dolls are srs fkn bns
13er series
Rozen maiden....
That doll has guns.
Shizuka: like umm
Zatch Bell? :)
Wait, why go by chronological order with Haruhi?
note to self, dont order dolls from that company
>rape
wat the HELL
uhhh dolls? O_o
is going ON!?
yay
13otakon: the core of the series is convincing jun to not be a recluse
13among other things
dang! That clown is only worth 10XP
otakon: Those two dolls used Leech Seed on the clown and killed it
those are some creepy dolls...
13also the dolls draw power from their kids
Will sleep with one eye open tonight >_>
creepy
He's her manbitch.
13this is why you read the fine print before ordering a spirit artifact
yup
Basically, they are betrothed to each other.
I can't wait for the new anime, the desu meme will return
YAY SHE'S AN ENERGY VAMPIRE
13not every day you see a clip show of the episode you just watched
Man. Bitch.
and she's SUCKING YOU DRY
Awww! D:
He is stuck with that ring..... FOREEEVEEER!
Pfft.
She's got a hole too, if you know what I mean.
dammit I don't want to miss the stream
Darf14: :O
bitch
So basically he's her bitch now
Dolls drinking tea?
otakon: Bow chicka bow wow
give her boiling hot tea
Scoot-Scootaloo: oh God
So yeah! Night y'all!
Tbh if you boil a kettle and the water fails to be boiling otakon I'd be impressed.
Night Scoots!
Seems like he kinda got screwed on this particular contract....but then, that's what happens when you sign a contract without reading it
If he goes to school with Shinku...
Shizuka: thanks for the stream
:D
13also his parents never show up
Looks like I'm delayed for a bit and won't even be able to know what's next.
hi
I'll bbl, playing TL2
...and I gotta go now.
wait Middleschool? wow he dropped out very early
13suddenly shinku
Shizuka: I want to say.... dead?
Such a cute dollie <3
13mitamaking: nah she just said it, they work overseas
Spin spin spin
Jun-kun~
13apparently that means you leave MIDDLE SCHOOLERS in charge of the house
what a demanding boy?
That thing screeching is really getting on my nerves. *mutes*
teeheehee
parents of the year
DOLLS! D:
Rape?
HE GON RAPE IT
Hah. The human is the DOLL's servant.
Bap.
....
Humans serve dolls, man how the tables have turned
>rape
http://i227.photobucket.com/albums/dd91/coelhosa/SuiseisekiAndHinaIchigo.gif
Oh now he's going to play tea party.
Denied
Man, this guy is a brat and his sister's a whiner.
13oh yes, every scene suiseiseki is in at the house is slapstick
Fantastic going overseas parents.
13you're going to *love* the stairs episode
:D
Shizuka: Oh yes
D'aaawww
Yep. This music.
Feels.
Stairs episode is 22 of the funniest minutes ever
Very light feels.
But still feels.
13oblivion town music and morrowind exploring music, is good for both worlds
NJET!
13BUSTED
LOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
OMG He plays with dolls! :O
LOLOLOL
13ladies and gentlemen our first desu
I like the fact it doesn't keep it secret
A talking doll.....so awesome!
She thinks the Rozen Maiden is his fuck-buddy.
Shizuka, episode later my ass.
13well
xD
13it's not suiseiseki
13who ends every other sentence with desu
dem eyes
So what's the deal? Is she an AI or something?
hmm...no Desu yet, maybe in the future :)
Paaaaaauuuuuusssse
It is every sentence
13hm... i think fmle just derped
NOOOO!!!
This broadcast is offline, apparently.
13hit play, we're still up
The stream just derped out.
Just as I come in.
There we go.
Just hit the refresh button ON the stream.
Awesome, Dark92Enigma

How many free periods do you have...
Every Wednesday I finish at 1:20
ScootaChicken: I'm in school. :P
Fair enough.
Ahahaha
Dabi at school
Oh it's the 28th

It's insane.
I am alright~
08,01my god, i've recently found i have an absolute *love* of Calvin and Hobbes
08,01it's so cute!
Jmo: Okey ;A;
08,01it's just the best comic ever!
I know, right? (if you know somewhere you can read them online please share!)
Just get the big collection books.
They can't be too expensive.
08,01i wish i could afford this: http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Complete-Calvin-Hobbes-v/dp/0740748475
ITS TOO HOT
I had one, a long time ago, but it loaded one strip at a time and slowly
Oh shit, 45 quid.
08,01if anyone wants to buy it for me :P
Thought it would be less expensive than that, given how old it is.
Hello over Feminin Bronies!
08,01ScootaChicken: reduced from a £100 RRP
I'm bored
watching ritalin'd by tomska
damn funny

Australian complaining about heat. Pussssies.

Sliverfish: Sounds like where I grew up. It was rarely over 45ish, but 35 degrees with near 100% humidity is a killer.

Otakon is tsundere towards Daribot.
Dang. Well I can't think of any more ships

MadSurge: lol.

SuperBrony64 x cow
JRP2234|Zzz: go away, you're sleeping!

He's too busy bitching about the heat.
LIttle wuss.
But I love heat!
Otakon x whatever woman he wants
OTP
Me x me
Kandarihu: Otakon x Anything is an OTP.
Otakon x Rivers will always have a place in my heart, if only because of how tsundere he is.
ScootaChicken, otakon hates being shipped in the way that he's usually shipped.
'Baka river gaijin! You know I'm never going in you! I mean, not like I don't, um, like you or anything...'
o////o
Because otakon ain't never goin' in the river.
Good lord.

Oh wait there it is!

Hi P0N-3!
bacon and applejack
I am a girl. I just got really drunk and puked.
actually
Lovely.
To know.
am in a bitchy mood right now.
bacon and applejack sounds like a good breakfast
Want a hug?
That's too bad. :<
I could go for some bacon and applejack
I do want a hug. D:
/me huggles P0N-3
Only hug you'll ever be getting.
Aww. *hugs*
/me eyerolls.
/me hugs P0N-3
theistic deities
08,01Ryunosuke: the Calvin and Hobbes argument for God
sounds redundant
]mo I want more hugs from you in the future. Just putting that out there.
Dat art
its looking good
*hugs Gold*
.-.
Fine.
actually
What's wrong, Mojay? D:
that brings up a question
08,01when other people are present, he is a stuffed animal
She wants more hugs in the future.
So needy <.<
I am so bucking drunk right now, omg. I was so drunk, i had a shower because I could feel the sick coming on and I wanted to be close to the porcelain throne.
08,01but Watterson has said that he is neither "imaginary" nor "magical"
basically a scientist
/me pokes AttackWithHugs
05got it working AttackWithHugs?
08,01from one reality (calvin's) you see hobbes as that causal actor who is alive and affects his environment
Wrek, nope. I'm downloading Chrome now. Hopefully that works
I hate being this drunk. Mixed drinks are eebil.
:)
08,01from other realities (everyone else), hobbes is just a stuffed animal
Why did you drink in the first place P0N-3
I mix and I drink. That's what I do.
05...
Why drink in the first place though?
05my RP senses are tingling
I am... DJ.
P0N-3: Then it's your own fault for not exercising restraint. :P
Oh god.
hey wrek
Just nooooooooooooooooo.
Well duh, I'm not denying that Gold.
I just lost control of it is all.
/me noms Jmo
Because, you know, judgment and drinking.
Now the question is: Are you ACTUALLY drunk or are you just playing a character that is drunk?
08,01for an atheist, God is the equivelent of a stuffed toy: a comforter that does not exist in any causal context
/me huggles AttackWithHugs
/me gives Jmo and cookie and waits for Chrome to install
I'm really drunk and it really really sucks,
uh huh
Ohai
Daaaaabiii~
flafi <3
<3
or as MIB put it
ohai der. <:
08,01that is to say, belief
Ewww it
it's a stinking dabi
It really, REALLY sucks. I was sick and it as was chunky.
das nawt wat u sed last nite ;D
08,01anyhoos, that's just my take
It all depends on what one expects out of a higher power, I think.
P0N-3: You're way too coherent to actually be drunk. :P
Bitch please, I wouldn't even touch you with a 50 feet pole.
foot*
No, I've just been typechatting since the nineties.
I can still type coherently. But slowly.
foot, feet, toes, hands, fingers
P0N-3: So've I. And I've NEVER been coherent while drunk.
Nose
agen u touched dat 50 foot pole last nite
;D
Well whoopdie doo.
You have no pole.
08,01Ryunosuke: douglas adams?
Living alone sucks. I want a hug irl.
08,01ah
08,01hahaha
08,01that just sounded adams-esque
08,01i could imagine ford saying that to arthur
true that
Just doesn't really make sense to me
I was just sick but I STILL feel awful.
What is this.
The point of view at which you look at it.
Just be thankful Uncle Sam guided him to the land of the free.
08,01remember, belief doesn't need to be justified by objective reality
Wth man.
08,01if such a thing exists
10:30 here
Oh goddess whatever.
I feel like a truck ran over my head.
Buytoast, I see you're in CST
08,013:30pm here
But that makes it a personal thing, something in your mind. Then your 'god' might be different from someone else's 'god', even though you claim to worship the same one
^
Oh wow I feel like I'm going to be sick again.
NOW THAT IS ATTENTION TO DETAIL!
... a'www
except for one small fact
God is not absolute :)
is the stream broken for chrome?
Ryunosuke, well, he kinda is.
that is like saying water is absolute :)
Oh goddess I'm in hell right now.
Wrek: dammit man that's what I love about your style, attention to DETAIL!
This is pretty awful!
08,01much like my dad, come to think of it
God looks different to everyone
08,01which itself is telling
that's all there is to it
water flows and ebbs, changes properties into ice or steam at the drop of a hat :)
and God isn't a he or a she, God is God
I fffff... I'm not drinking any more. This is stupid.
I don't want this to happen again.
P0N-3: good on you
Wrek: wonderful attention to detail mate
Energy drinks, from now on. No more liquor.
08,01otakon: exactly
Liquor is really really bad.
P0N-3: it is, stay away from it
I will!
But you're equating God to an imaginary friend in a sense
Something that only exists in your mind
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
P0N-3: not really, just in great quantities does it, like anything else, is bad
stick a cupcake in my eye.
fosters home for imaginary gods
Gold_Demona: good analogy
twilight_sprinkle: my kind of place
Where as God is supposed to actually exist, I dunno what the right word would be, in a different plane of existence
Spiritual rather than physical
and your both forget god is well god. he isent limited by your thoughts. he can be anything aand everything
No, Ryunwhatsit, I'm convinced liquor is really bad.
otakon: even if you get hit by lightning for taking the last cookie?
night all
twilight_sprinkle: it was worth it
JRP2234|Zzz: morning and bye
Ehh, again that seems to be as though I could say "that square is black" and you say "that square is white"
I might as well smoke weed. I never see potheads going through this.
It can't be both
.-.
05of fuck
05hit maximum layers for the image xD
Wrek: o dear
Wrek: lol TIME TO DO IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY!
why would they make a layer limit?
Time to start merging layers, Wrek? :D
I'm gonna be hung over now, I just know it. And it's going to suck.
wrek how much?
water
lots of water
infernap12: it's just that the program can't support more than what he has... and it's like 30 layers
08,01anyhoos, i've gotta go work now
08,01see y'all!
also hi Phase4
What do you mean twilight_sprinkle?
by they i meant the programs developers
Wrek: love the attention to detail man
Has anyone here been through this>
infernap12: bc they couldn't make it support mor than that
This is why I came here.
P0N-3: keep hydrated it'll help
I want people to relate to me...
Been through what?
P0N-3: and eat somthing
black and white can be determined
Ahahahahaha
Black is all colors
P0N-3: Yup. Hangovers suck.
Has anyone not been through it?
White is absense of color
by the amount of light that is absorbed
I have had something to eat, hence getting chunky when I got sick.
And I've been downing water.
I haven't been through it cause I don't like drink at all.
fgt dabi
Ryunosuke: If I died
And went to heaven
And saw God
I think the water actually made it worse.
Then would that not mean he exists
Not just for me, but for everyone
I had way too much Lambs 151.
If I died, and that was it
Nothing
Would that not mean he doesn't exist
For everyone
Can I have your stuff then dabi?
He might exist as an idea, a belief, fine
P0N-3: Water is the only true fix for it. Because it replaces all the water that the alcohol took out
or u were nughty
Even though you're poor as lel.
But imaginary friends are also real in that sense.
hey guys
heya alexxm
Yeah, Gold_Demona, well I think the water jsut increased the surface area of the alcohol.
And I absorbed it super fast.
how've you been naturesfury
welcome to the debate
I got sick pretty quick,
And yet once you die, there's no coming back. You can't send a message to the living detailing what happened.
P0N-3: Increasing the surface area doesn't increase the content
hmm
Well I sure got sick.
what Kandarihu said
P0N-3: Did you drink any AFTER you got sick?
they should make an internet in heaven
alexxm: very good. got some1 to draw my oc pony for me off of dev art :)
Kandarihu: That doesn't matter though
P0N-3: just keep drinking water and eat something
Yeah I've been drinking water since then.
Good. Keep at it
This isn't my first time round the block, guys.
twilight_sprinkle: well it's another plane of existence it doesn't work that way... it's like comparing steam to plasma
P0N-3: and yet you came here for advice
otakon: it was a joke
I came here for compassion. >.<
twilight_sprinkle: twas a lousy joke
loladvice
;~;
compassion... on the internet
:)
lol
P0N-3: you get no compassion, you're own fault for drinking too much
P0N-3: My advice, either don't drink so much, or man up and deal with it
Jmo: set him straight Aussie
Ryunosuke, it's more likely than you think
You're own fault
Ahahahaha
Well hey you guys have been throug h the same thing, you know how this feels.
Lawl Wrek
That works too
XD
compassion.exe not found in internet/bronystate
What happened, someone drink too much and whining about it?
05yeah
I feel really crappy and I just want a hug.
Grow some balls.
You reap what you sow.
05dont complain about drinkign untill you've been in a snaps contest
P0N-3: once, I have been hung-over exactly once
I learned not to do it again :p
I've been hung over many times. YOU try being a DJ and see how it goes.
>_>
P0N-3: I was rather more busy being passed out over a toilet seat instead of bugging people on IRC. :P
well wrek has oktoberfest :)
P0N-3: yeah but I did it to myself once to experience it. I prepared for it. The key is to drink an equal amount of water that you drink to liquor AND afterwards. The Hangover is mostly caused by dehydration from processing POISON
05see dari?
05roleplaying
People feed you shots. It happens.
P0N-3: then stop drinking so much
I once drank so much my bathroom smelled like puke for days.
Gold_Demona: ew
Ryunosuke, that's Germany :D
You're lightweight Dabi.
Gold_Demona: TMI man
Bitch please
I've never been drunk.
Lightweight.
i thought wrek WAS German :p
i dont even drink
P0N-3 wants relatability? I'm relating
Ugh. I'm not a lightweight.
Ryunosuke: no that's Vivi, Wrek is Swedish
Cause you're too young child.
Ryunosuke, no he's Swedish
ahh
got it
Ryunosuke: remember Wrek is the resident Viking Overlord
05no if i was german id have an accent like dark horst
lol
Jmo: You don't even drink
true dat
Jmo, I'm only too young till 18 Jan 2013
Anyway I'm gonna sto[p drinking so much.
Just beer for me from now on.
Cause I don't like alcohol.
Durrr.
and actually IIRC, Vi isn't even "German" she's Austrian(sp?)
But I've drank a wine cooler in about 10 minutes
well... I wouldnt say just beer
Shots are teh ebil.
Let's get a fucking beer bong in you and see who's the lightweight
but take it in mderation :)
Bitch please.
05sad thing is
and not all beers are the same :)
Has anyone here actually DJ'd?
I'm Australian, I'll still be standing.
05but id like to give it a shot
Drinks are like, on the house.
05did ratehr well at buck
Wrek: but.. YOU'RE A VIKING! I thought you lot LIVED on mead?
P0N-3: Vivi does when she gets the chance to, not been on lately though
Wrek: Ahahaha, we should play the Black Dynamite drinking game together
I swear people feed me drinks just to see if I mess up.
05definetly
GOD that was a great movie
Every time someone says Black Dynamite you drink
05also dari
05check stream :3
To be hones tyou only need that one rule otherwise it's ridiculous
Checking, sec
I never want to see another shot again, this is terrible. Even worse is how many times I've thought the EXACT SAME THING.
Now for sure, NO MORE.
Fuck me Wrek
ew dabi
I have literally no idea how you do that shit
not in here
P0N-3: I give you a week
I'm tired of getting sick, Otakon.
Wrek: your skill, I am jelly of it ;3;
Just energy drinks now, that's it.
P0N-3: well dude the key is ...NOT THAT
P0N-3: WATER! NOT ENERGY DRINKS
i want
I'm a girl, not a dude....
Yeah, that's all well and good to say otakon
Wrek: daaaaayum dat Vinyl~
But I just don't get how a blank canvas ends up as THAT
It's fucking crazy
And it's working again. Just needed to get off the page for a bit
P0N-3: I never said otherwise, but seriously WATER, not energy drinks
And yeah I've been drinking water.
Cure for hangover is more alcohol, for real
Practice you newbs .-.
tail is still flat though
Oh god I still taste the sick!
P0N-3: keep drinking water, energy drinks are bad
Wrek: tail still flat, trying to remove a layer to detail it?
05yeah
05im compressign things that i wont change
I should probably just go to bed.
Wrek: you could try taking the tail, putting it in another new page, alter it there and then paste it back it
P0N-3: That might be good too.
in*
Yeah. I'll talk to you guys later.
I never thought that there would be a limit for layers when you're drawing something.
Thanks for talking to me, guys.
Love you...
copy cut the tail, paste on new page, alter it, copy cut and paste it back in the pic
.-.
P0N-3: feel better though, remember WATER and eat something
Oi
what program is this?
hiya spight
is tht pony wearing socks
infernap12, Paint Tool SAI
infernap12: it's Adobe SAI iirc
Adobe SAI.
wipergone2: yeah, socks on ponies is a thing
And yes, she's wearing socks
:O
wipergone2: why aren't you?
:3
That, was, so, bad, potato.
I'll eat something when my stomach settles, Otakon. Thanks for caring. Seriously, it's nice.
i wear socks
dem ponies love their socks
otakon, Paint Tool SAI :3
is socks canon
Don't you just hate it when the curve won't cooperate?
AttackWithHugs: okay
wipergone2: I think it is actually
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF SOCKS ARE CANON?
last ep made it canon
how did pony wear socks
I think they are, since it's just about everywhere
Didn't Rarity wear socks in the Too Many Pinkies episode?
Real ponies actually look relly weird wearing socks,.
The socks just highlight how freakishly skinny their legs are.
That detail on the headphones cord, Wrek. :D
P0N-3: Real ponies would look weird with technicolored fur, too. :D
That is true.
dem darn technicolor donkeys
I'd like to draw my OC wearing socks but I can't seem to put it on paper for some reason. It looks awesome in my head, though.
I don't like Babs Seed because she was insensitive to a donkey.
She made him teh sads.
Maybe I should draw my OC wearing socks. I've already drawn her sleeping several times. XP
that donkey had some swag goin n
*on
Babs Seed is a bitch.
I hope she gets better,
She did at the end of the episode
I hope it lasts
It should
Since the bullying thing was just temporary
Um.
Just a thought?
/me slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
the shadow on the cord looks weird to me
but eh, what do i know
"Too cool for mules" *donkey* "Oh well FML"
AttackWithHugs: is it a fluffy pony? :3
We should remember that Babs seed, along with Applebloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie belle. They're all kids still.
Mule ≠ Donkey...
so they're gonna make stupid mistakes a bit
is play on the phrase to cool for school/ to school for cool
yeah I was thinking that, they're kids.
Gold_Demona: that mule got offended this time :D
tiara and silver spoon are also kids, so they might get etter
Might
huge emphasis on might
but probably not on screen
MadSurge, yes. She's not a giant fluff/puff ball but she certainly has a really fluffy coat. Must be something she uses.
Phase4: hi
MadSurge, which explains why her cutie mark is a couple of pillows
Nah, Tiara and Silver Spoon's special talents are having inheritnces.
AttackWithHugs: awww <3
dat mane
They're special talents involve being spoiled brats. =P
their*
6 dat grammar fail
MadSurge: hi
I'm not going to spell inheritances prperly, too drunk.
Hi wipergone2!
I thought you were going to sleep .-.
MadSurge: dat mane and socks
Their special talents are being over-privileged.
^
P0N-3: I thought you were getting some sleep?
wipergone2: that's a pretty good Vinyl :)
Yeah I should get some sleep.
I'm pretty tired now.
http://imgur.com/Q1zxR
P0N-3: hi
Hi
AttackWithHugs: D'awww :3
AttackWithHugs: :D
I drew that for a friend in about 10 minutes
I'm gonna go to bed. I gotta go to bed.
I'll be back later, guys.
Peace out, bronies.
Night!
Night P0N-3 :)
Nini. :D
bye P0N-3
Love you guys., See you later.
AttackWithHugs: AAAA :D :3

Faaabulous~

0526 minutes for my download to finish
05hmm
05strange
what dl?
05didnt know they made 6 season of that show
Fluttershy beat Machamp? :<
05im downloadign 6 seasons of more nostalgia
YEs
finally wrek is drawing again :D
Wrek: What are you downloading?
My Machamp's a hugger.
Gold_Demona: :).
05just more cartoons
Now you've got me anticipating, Wrek. I'm really curious now
Wrek what tablet do you use?
05intous 4
ah
Love the design on the glasses :)
Wrek: season 6 of jack?
05jack only got 4 seasons
:C
Wrek How long have you been working on this?
05maybe...
0512ish hours by now?
05constant work
Gold_Demona: well duh, Fluttershy is a flying type. :D
05spread through 4 days
ah
Im curious how do you start ? , no need to answer now.
lol MadSurge
MadSurge: Oh yeah! That's right. XD
Wait, does flying type rape fighting?
05i sketch a detailed outline and shape
MadSurge: I don't imagine her attack would be very high though. =/
Serenity: yes
05then i fill it with the base single coat color
05so no outlines
ah
Yeah
Oohh, didn't know that
05and then i shade forth the shape
Poor fighting type
thats my problem , i make linework ...
and then fail removing it
Gold_Demona: yeah, but assertive Fluttershy is scary :D
MadSurge: Maybe she's got super high special attack. :D
05the headphoens turned out suprisingly realistic
Yeah
What I don't get, is why can dragons rape themselves :L
Gold_Demona: :D
Those headphones are amazing
They look awesome from this distance
Serenity: Ghosts can also
Really? Thought it was a normal effect
Serenity: And uh, can we find a word other than "rape"? :<
That tail is going to look amazing :o Love the shape of it.
Sure
Serenity: ... What?
Serenity: Ghosts are weak against other Ghosts and Dark types
Dragons are weak against other dragons and Ice types
Gold_Demona: why normal and ghosts are immune to each other now? :(
MadSurge: I have no idea
One sec
I must look it up
woah Lots of playlists xD
Look what up?
"Invaders must die!" How very appropriate for PS2.
:p
evening
heya Eli
Hi Eli
Howdy Eli!
Hiyo Eli
i see i came right for prodigy
Gold_Demona: they're also weak to Psychic attacks
otakon: Who are?
I hate rock types and ground types SO MUCH
Gold_Demona: Ghost types
otakon: Wrong
I love my rock and ground types
otakon: Poison types are
Gold_Demona: -_- TO THE WIKI!
otakon: Ghastly line are ghost/poison
When you're an electric type, they are a HUGE pain, espeically when dynamicpunch constantly misses
otakon: Ghost types are not weak to psychic, but poison types are
brb
Reconfiguring bouncer
Gold_Demona: then why is Confuse such an OP skill in the first game?
Gold_Demona: dat ultrabugged Psychic type in G1
Wrek: didn't you use the pattern on these socks on one of your recent drawings?
otakon: Because we didn't have steel and dark types to offset the Psychic type
Gold_Demona: seriously it's super effective against EVERYTHING and the first time you fight a Drowzee it's a goddamn nightmare
otakon: 'cause the first game was broke as hell
^
Your mother is broken.
/me slaps SpeccyRush around a bit with a large trout
otakon: The first game wasn't very balanced. Psychic types were godly in that game.
I never had a problem with the first game and psychics
Don't think I used one when I first played and I got through fine
otakon: The Ghastly line were the only ghosts back then, and they were all part poison type. So of course they were all weak to psychics.
ooooooh
Wrek do you use textures or did you draw them details yourself?
05Eli: same technique
it's been so long since I played I forgot about that
05different pattern
otakon: Ghosts and bugs were supposed to be strong against Psychic, but due to a bug Ghost was double weak to them instead of resistance, and bugs were pretty much worthless
otakon: If you look at ones like Misdreavus, which are only ghost types and NOT poison, they are NOT weak to psychic.
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large tuna
As I said
Gold_Demona: odd never noticed till now
Never had a problem
And I was probably 8 or something
So it can't have been that hard
Psychic is my favorite type.
otakon: Serebii man, best source of pokemon info.
Wrek: ok. looked the same from far away
Gold_Demona: i usually go by my memory of the old guide really and Bulbapedia
Gold_Demona: Scrafty is a godsend against Dark, Psychic and Ghost :D
But I love two Pokemon in particular
But everyone knows normal types are the superior breed.
Gyrados and Geodude
My entire team is normal type and I feel superior because of it.
Buytoast: yeah when it's the only thing you can get
Buytoast: have fun getting whupped by a single Ghastly
otakon: I love gyarados. It's the only pokemon who has a quad-weakness and still kicks ass.
... the strongest type is dark.
05pfft
Normal types don't only know normal type attacks you know.
Gold_Demona: quad? really? I thought he was only doubly weak against Electric types?
How uninformed can you be?
05types itnroduced past G1 are fanon
Buytoast: but it's the majority of their attacks
Gyarados is badass
Wrek: my man!
Are you le serious?
since darkrai is strongest pokemon ever. some might not like it, but it's just the truth
otakon: It's called quad-weak because the effect is quadrupled.
You've never used a normal type I'm guessing son.
I know Surf, Ice Beam, Crunch...
You name it
Pfft
Gold_Demona: ah, well he kicked ass in my games but I never had him fought against Electric types
otakon: Just regular weakness is double effect.
hell, even got a solarbeam
It evolved
Only had half health
Gary decided to turn up
Killed all of his pokemon with newly evolved gyarados
Darkrai: puts you to sleep and then gives you damage -In percent- of your health. your health doesn't matter. darkrai wins
Fuck yes
you see?
and then he gets HYPER BEAM!
normal is superior
nobody can beat my Snorlax
05nothign beats jacks water beetle
nor my Slaking
I'm just that incredible
damn if only we could have an online match ;_;
lol and stream it
That'd be cool.
I don't like battling people though, so I'd mostly be spectating. :P
i haven't played in ages, but i don't think anything will ever be stronger than darkrai
I never use legendaries because they're broken as hell.
Gold_Demona: Well, they're OP.
If anything.
Everlasting_Joy: That's what I said. :P
damn nice picture
Gold_Demona: ... Can you not tell I am hardly awake?
lol
I need to get me some lunch.
hell, i ahven't played in a while either
but i know i'd win
i have a Porygon
I can't lose
Buytoast: Kill everything with seizure attack?
05brb
:D
Pikachu was actually the one causing the seizures
^
Porygon throws the BEST rave parties.
It was Pikachu shocking some missles that caused it.
I never watched the episode, so I really wouldn't know. :P
Porygon is really pissed about being misblamed
Episode where James has tits
^^^^^^^ :D
Best episode
:P
Yeah
i liked the one where tentacool and tentacruel ripshit up
and that crazy old biddie is shootin rockets at them and shit
not exactly, for a time it was, but then it was released in a mutilated and cut form
Was the tentacruel ep banned because of the twin towers?
hi guys. nice collar, Wrek
more wasn't showed for a very very long time afterwards
Sure, PM me it

Wrek: thought as much, the animation is rough.

otakon, yes he did
...
Plank did it
I forgot how odd this show was
I always loved the odd background noises.
05dem deus ex glasses
^
08,01oh! Ed, Edd, and Eddy!
I read some article on Cracked about TV show theories and that everyone's parents in Ed, Edd and Eddy were dead
05AttackWithHugs: i remember reading that too
good thing those tv thories are stupid as hell
AttackWithHugs: I hate that kind of bullshit theories
And that the character's clothing represents each decade, and Johnny had cancer
AttackWithHugs: Not true, we see Ed's mom's hand and Eddy's dad's hand.
In later episodes.
yup
The Plank is a spai
05what a sucky water gun
Actually, the Spongebob one might be bullshit but the explosion they show in every episode is a real explosion
and psychological breaking in 3, 2, 1
A little Chinese water torture.
I can't recall it much but something about the bombing of Bikini Atoll
I get it Water boarding
dafuq
HE NEEDS TO PISS
Please, everyone knows this is all Eddy's dream, who is really old and is remembering his childhood :D
SpeccyRush water boarding is brutal

Good.

how've you been somepony+else
SWAG
05yeah sicne peopel cant keep their mouths shut
hey alexxm :) a bit tired but ok
05its made very simple
05to talk about unaired episodes
05at all
Well you said the next epsiode would be popular, someone asked why, so I was expecting you to explain
Which would most likely be a spoiler
It was just a reminder
05^
Ya thanks for catching me in time
Wrek: flag Trixie as a kickword :D
...
MadSurge
*facepalm*
What the fuck part of no spoilers do you not get?
MadSurge, so if someone said "Meanwhile x Trixie is OTP", they would get kicked just from Trixie?
YED
Well...
Hm...
ed best pony lol
Rick Krispies! Now that I had your attention, Hello everypony!
they're ponies ^^
Hmm, I guess that would be suspicious enough for the kick script to be a spoiler in and of itself.
...ponies?
madsurge. this is what we call conclusive spoilers
Hi, VenHur. :)
hi VenHur
Someone should make a crossover if it hasnt been done already.
Hoi VenHur
how about we all just drp this conversation??
Ah, whoops <_<
Yeah, it's fine Tiggles
It's like chastising someone for spoiling, but also pinging them so the morbidly curious might scroll up just to see what somepony said that's a spoiler.
Punkie_Pue, a crossover of what? There's nothing that doesn't have an MLP crossover now
^
Hi AJIsAwesome, somepony_else and AttackWithHugs!
/me wonders if there's a Macross/MLP crossover.
Not a crossover, but someone should animate it with mlp characters. Poor choice of words
it's just a cradel
TIP IT OVER
Now I know you guys are wondering, "What the hell is Rick Krispies?"
VenHur, the relative of Rice Krispies?
*who
Or maybe just Macross Equestria, following a Giant Immigration Fleet inhabited entirely by ponies.
suddenly vantriloquist dummy
Well, it started off yesterday, I was watching a fireplace video when somebody posted some Rice Krispies comment.
I replied back, but little did I realise I made a typo.
05master juggler
how is he...
J_E_Smith, that's interesting news.
haha
:D
And that's how Rick Krispies was borned!
J_E_Smith: That's pretty cool. So we can expect MLP to be seen at Chuck E Cheese?
VenHur but where did "Rick" come from?
dat compression
05those errors are in the rip
AttackWithHugs: The typo.
05'tis not the stream
welp the video just went crazy
which considering the scene fits perfectly
I accidentally made a "k" in the end instead of "e".
VenHur, aaaah
Oh yeah I was there for that. It was hilarious
Or maybe Hearth's Warming Eve being reimagined in the context of the Macross sequels, with three seperate fleets populated by separate tribes and all fighting over the same planet.
AJIsAwesome: Sometimes, but I think just a short clip during intermission when they do. I was actually there last month to grab a Chicken Cibatta and they ran an Aquabats clip
Or last week
My Shockwave Flash had crashed... -_-
J_E_Smith: Ah, I see.
http://derpiboo.ru/125445?scope=scpe7f6cb56586abf0fea9a91e3c3a12958827846ca3 i found a triple crossover
VenHur, just be glad that what happened to me didn't happen to you.
So yeah, I accidently made a meme yesterday, Rick Krispies.
never eard of it
tell me more
It's an common thing to me now, like a cartoon gag.
VenHur, congratulations
Rick Krispies, only the Krispiest of the Ricks lol VenHur
dat art
Dat solution
Rick Krispies, God of the Tacos!
05last ep methinks
To Rick Krispies! *toasts*
hahah
A doughnut
VenHur that should be your ping.
WHERE IS HIS FOLKS!?
Oooh the photos one!
oh my
I dont think the parents ever make an appearance.
That's a sexy mantis
^
^^
Actually, Kandarihu said to me yesterday that Rick Krispies should be a person's name. I lol'ed when I readt that.
Polaroid camera
MadSurge: my favorite one of all time is when the ed's break the physics of reality trying to solve things
VenHur, who now?
MadSurge: it's also my fav :3
A meme that I accidently created.
Too bad Polaroid doesn't make cameras anymore. Them things were fun.
VenHur: Actually in Tim Burton's recent movie Frankenweenie there's a character named "Rzykruski"(Sounds like Rice Krispie)
^
J_E_Smith: Now I know!

Im scared of broken glass

08,01which, to you yanks, is british for elevators
What is wrong with you
I don't think I've got an irrational fear of anything
I like bananas as well. They're a great fruit.
epic jump is epic
But bananas are awesome
He has to be a jedi to jump like that lol
Well, you know where you're not gonna find any bananas..?
anyone here watches octor who?
...
Me!
You hate bananas because they're yellow?
meh, doctor who got lame ages ago
who is your favorite doctor?
ace: I used to watch it
I like the tom baker one
VenHur: so you hate mmmmmbananas?
Why would you hate that?

You guys with your irrational fears and dislikes
wut?
So weird. :P
This episode has too much talking. What is this, Naruto?!

Wrek: Or the Hub and the media are evil. They didn't do these many spoilers last season did they?
I'm not
havent you noticed, its looks like his eyes are on the sides of his face
but dabi, what about your dislike of matt smith
05J_E_Smith: they did
i have to go, dinners :d
08,01i don't particularly mind looking at plants
08,01i just *hate* touching them
Oh
Huh
08,01this is why i never do gardening
08,01i don't exactly have a small garden either...
i love his smile
08,01i usually get my brother in to do my gardening for me
08,01pay him in alcohol
05garden as in scrotum?
He just Jacked shit up in there, lol.
08,01Wrek: those things aren't even similar!
twilight_sprinkle: Eh, I have reasons for disliking him though.
05i blame english
Make brother treat the roses > Give him alcohol to sooth the pain from getting spiked by the roses a thousand times > Profit
08,01VenHur: linden lime, or fruit lime?

Yeah
08,01ah, okay

yay Wrek , thank Luna you came back cause i think the chat was going nuts :D
08,01oh, i know what that is
True - Standard chat won't see the emoticons
05i can guess the casue but i dont know for sure
ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)﻿
youtube! why you no bookmark my videos?!?
08,01it means that something crashed out real hard in windows
08,01probably a bug in a driver
At least it just BSoD'd on you, quickly and dramatically.
05oo awesome
08,01could even be a fault in a high area of ram, or an overheating cpu
Rose`:The new Youtube start page is driving me nuts
05this water has jsut enough lemon it it not to be sour at all
08,01most likely a driver fault, thoguh
05jsut tase of lemon<3
<3
05and seeing how big the image im working on it
05s
05casued it
My computer went out VERY slowly. My Video Driver kept crashing over and over again until I killed Firefox.
:o
Go Chrome or go home

08,01Wrek: nah, that wouldn't have done it
08,01your computer would have just started swapping like a mofo
Hi Everybody :) (This is still The_Engineer)
anyone here watches game of thrones
Nope
05Pyro: both seasons have been streamed here
So I'm running a full Virus Scan. Arbitrarily no gaming until it's done. I might have to forbid other things too.
really!?
08,01though i guess if it was swapping out of the hard drive, and it had a read error, that's more likely than other hardware failing
well g2g see ya guys
dosent game of thrones have nudity in it?
The_Engineer_FROM_TC, what is TC?
Bye Pyro :)
08,01but a driver bug is most liekly, still

The_Engineer_FROM_TC: Then why not name yourself TCR Engineer? :)
ummm
Wrek, yeah. and the 132 other people in here ^^
