11,02Disc 3: Aboard the Nautilus
*here
11,02This show is about these two kids and their adventure out in the ocean.
11,02It's inspired by 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
More "Made by Hideaki Anno"? YES!!!
I know OF Touhou...
I know of Touhou, but I haven't played any of the games.
i've played touhou, ambivalent about it
Hmm...
Manzai?

I actually have been meaning to watch Nadia.
THIS is based loosely on 20K leagues?
REALLY!?
11,02Aye

This is anime is mostly good. Mostly.
Sadly it's 1:42 AM here
I feel young here in terms of t.v shows
bye all, take care I'll bb tomorrow
11,02You think they would just create a random character called 'Captain Nemo' for now reason :3
00,10I thought it was based on macross, cause it has captan global
guess I am the only boke lover here. :'(
11,02no*

0,5MASF123 >:I
I believe the very first time i wen't here i didn't read the rules, But did sometime later however.
^Everyone can make mistakes
i'm having a thought but i has the dumb today
0,5MASF123 have you read them since then?
Haha. Wow. Another wacky derp moments from yours truly. :P

lolwow
...
This won't end well.
The picture was drawn by someone else
oh...ok...I guess cavier rhymes with something in Italian?
I prefer the American version...
lol.
Well, unfortunately Season 2 isn't released in Italy yet...
Which one? Feeling Pinkie Keen?
Ovviamente
^
Sure
after all, the rules are talking high
ohhhhh thanks Rainbow doesnt really follow her element got it
But that is called, "Selective hearing."
well, how many of you believe that those characters really exist somewhere in the universe?
Where Pinkie's tail twitches and Twilight can't explain it
Season1 Episode 15
i think pinkie keens lesson is not to turn into Rabidash
Twilight wants to prove that Pinkie's Pinkie Sense makes no sense?
And Twilight doesn't believe her sense
Although the lesson might be "you don't have to understand/overanalyse something to enjoy it"
Also hi
<<<<everypony look
Those credits. . .
It's overall about how you should atleast show respect to those that believe in it, or even cause you can't understand or explain it,

Why? You listened to his songs, you decided you dont like, why does it hurt you if he continoues to make those songs. there are very scenarios where you have NO control if you want to listen to his songs or not...

I used to think you were all clopers
11,01They've been doing it for a long time.
they were still games
i wish people would let me play it in my club
not wallets
xD
11,01dinky: Seriously?
lol
he HATED working on NFS
11,01Chrysalis: Because of publishers that abuse them?
developers used to make games
now they follow task lists
11,01Thought it is.
the rise of gaming has ruined it for gamers and developers alike
/me Dances
more crashes?
/me spins
damn
SUUUUUUPERRRMANNNNNNN 666666666666664444444444444444
05and the indie market
11,01I think indie and kickstarter is the future.
11,01Because greedy publishers that are exploiting the market are killing gaming.
"what? yeah, I ship ponies." *drives delivery van for hasbro*
05steams system for allowing games is fucked up
/me dances to the rhytm.
11,01Publishers are crashing the market.
let us only play good games like bastion and other indiegames
SUUUUUUUUUPEEERRRMEAAAAATBOY
hmm
11,01I would stay out of the gaming industry.
05raidign at the same time ill explain in a bit
they are incredibly tough to make
gaming industry is a hit business. like movies
11,01Until it crashes.
all the fun has been sapped out of it
well its hard to make it in every indrustry
Well, there's the indie gaming market.
..
Barbershop cortet
11,01MaxTheBrony: Go indie.
well this is kinda good
intresting cover

and the xbox is incredibly out of date now
YOU ARE A GREAT SONG PICKER!
11,01Angry Birds is not crashing the market.
no, but it caused a HUGE push towards the mobile market
yey :D
Always...
Its anus now
Boo yah!
if theres one thing i hate, its mobile gaming
xD
I Dont
I like moble gaming
I I I I DON'T DON'T DON'T DON'T
i hate it more than bieber
Kinda
You ofc mean "Avast, it be Fluttershy's plot!"
11,01Mobile gaming is not killing the industry.
11,01That's a change if anything.
Yeah
its just a change like from cartridges to discs
except the platform is far far worse
in every way
11,01EA-like publishers are ruining those games all the same.
Well many don't approve the gameing on mobiles
less power, less finesse
and the most god-awful control system ever invented
05the problem plaguing the indie market is funding though
05henceforth kickstarters are awesome
awwwwwwwwwwww (squee)
Load like
because they wouldnt sink the time into making a decent one
11,01EA kind-of ruined them.
Nykkes64 was fast
those endings, were appalling
05i mean come on
05EA are worse than the bank of amuriica
Eargasm right here
yeah the endings wernt great
05fucktards
but they at least didnt leave a taste of manure in my mouth
