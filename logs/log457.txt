00,10oh i like it
I'm looking for receptions to this anime
Thank god.
So Red's name in Japanese is Akai?

The f**k.
athw
nice melons
oh yukko...you are hilarious

Sumica: its a simple story but still epic
FlareChaser|Octavia: you should make a tank, tanking is more fun than dps imo:P
this show is just too awesomely random
"Theuy're so bouncy and round. Canm I squeeze them!"
Suika
Dan: Alas, I love healing though :P
His body is ready
superretroworld: not for me
Why is there a spring attached to her.
FlareChaser|Octavia: healing works too, I hate healing :D
japan
SuperGotenks1989: shes a robot
I want a talking kitty
japan. Full of wonder
Dan: You shall heal from now on!
superretroworld examples for EPIC: Dragon Ball, DBZ, Saint Seiya (original), Kinnikuman, Yu Yu Hakusho, One Piece, Sailor Moon, etc

OmegaMetroidBrony: Yes we know
Thanks Pegasus_Gunthler. :)
Dark92Enigma: Ponies! :D
stream's getting glitchy glitcchy goo ya know?
Woodenfan: i would suggest watching it from the beginning, while its not absolutely important, there are some references to previous episodes in the future episodes
Dark92Enigma: I guess I was too hopeful in expecting a genre shift, maybe something darker, but NOPE. TNA's getting a lot better now, however.
My sister is watching thsi with me
ok thanks Ingwaz
...
I liked Fluttershy in the tree costume
Woodenfan: not to mention if you enjoy the few episodes you've seen, you'll most likely enjoy the others as well
The return of Dickshep... Oh how I've been waiting for this moment! :D
Canon Fluttertree
Is anything streaming or is my stream just busted?
I still think it'd be neat to have
Who's Dickshep?

00,10was just beeing pissy cause it was just updated
Ninjazz: XD
when an arrow and a knee love eachother VERY much...
Night OmegaMetroidBrony. And I keep a Valve nightlight on just for that :P
EA sucks. Fact.
Ninjazz: I wub Rainbow Dash, heard the news yet?:D
CupcakeWarrior: I bounce between the two IRL, honestly.
WallDives....i was eskeptical (i spelled it right, right?) about Roode's heel turn at the mere beggining of his title reign....but now? He pretty much became THE MAN TO BEAT, if you know what i mean.....he proved that he is championship material
then again, I jumble the JP and US names anyway.
Derpy_Hooves: Lyra died D:
TheRainbowDash: No, what news?
TheRainbowDash: I really just cant wait :P
TheRainbowDash: Oh I didn't know TheRainbowDash loves Rainbow Dash. Did you know that I, in fact, love Rainbow Dash too. Only Rarity sits on my screen more. ;)

WallDives ......i remember a promo when Booker T went to TNA.....Roode interfered and stated ''My name is Robert Roode, and i'm the future of this company!'' He's pretty much the present of the company right now

I think I feel stupid for not watching the avengers with my cousins that one time
Neither have I, but I dont really care about spoilers. Probably wont ever see the movie
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYUP
Why was there so much hype over the avengers? Its just another superhero movie
I saw avengers with some friends. When the credits started, they started getting up. I just stayed seated and said "Where do you think you're going?"
CupcakeWarrior I guess crossovers?
Why wouldnt you leave during the credits?
CupcakeWarrior: It's better than it sounds.
cachi01: the Hulk is just badass
0,14ouch

I was going to watch it with my old friends from back in highschool, but some had to cancel so we all canceled :(
but the hulk is so low tier...
CupcakeWarrior: THIS ONE HAS MORE SAMUEL L JACKSON
shir
Somebody cant take a hit~
CupcakeWarrior: because it's a superhero movie that's been built up in film canon for nearly 5 years, is written by a guy who's kind of a Nerd Sacred Cow, and has made buttloads of money.
MahBoi777: fave part was when hulk randomly punched thor xD
XD
and the movie reminds me of return of harmony lol
CupcakeWarrior: also, every marvel movie has a stinger/teaser for the next movie in the credits.
interesting bomb bye the way
and has shitloadds of easter eggs
RAWRity: Whats the next movie?
Sumica : lol i clicked on my pony songs and i played Super Speedy Cider song
lol
RainBowJack: that song gets stuck in my head really easily
y not octavia
Dan : yeah just like Day Aria is in my
Also, though it's not in canon wiht the other ones, the director of Hot Fuzz is working on an "Ant-man" movie.
Sumica: What class are you?
RAWRity: There is an ant superhero?
Adept

Biotics so Adept
CupcakeWarrior: XXDD nooo he can increase and decrease his size

sounds kinda lame
there wasnt a tornado
internet however did go out for a bit around here
:P
but if it's edgar wright, then it might be alright
CupcakeWarrior: it's by the guy who made Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, so it's kind of assured to be both silly as all hell, and awesome.
MLP has some very sticky songs...
Ebeny
Dan: i love the hole song because it reminds me of the little mermaid
RainBowJack: how?

if u recognize the following song then u r awesome

0,14man, that's longer than my 1 hour shower
RAWRity, oh yes, it was before WMC, right?
SparklyWaffles: That's a long shower! Dang! I shower in like 5 minutes. :P
Because, technically, Spider's Web was never WMC'd
My showers only take 20 minutes
SparklyWaffles: oh...that makes sense, I thought you liked it.
11,01I'm back. I had to leave before my cynicism tripped.
11,01I hate hating.
dat inception lol
I'm sure Bronystate will love you RAWRity
rather, the dyed hair, you said you liked it.
You need to love more, Nittany_Discord.
11,01But I'm not given many reasons not to.
lol
Only 2 films have been WMC'd: Epic Movie and Babes in Toyland
Hey Nittany_Discord *hugs*
Sumica : yes but have the network thing for ME3
11,01My hobby was destroyed, and I'm just VERY pissed.
Nittany_Discord: You can count me pissed too.
Yep.... WELL. I now officially have blue hair.
Spider's Web would've, but we didn't have WMC yet
Mass Effect 3 = Epic Fail
Ninjazz: what happen?
11,01I bet ME3 is fine.
SparklyWaffles: I would make Shizune jokes at you, but you wouldnt get them.
13ping
Hai Shizu
Ohai Shizuka
0,14vooom
The ending
RAWRity: Same reason as Nittany_Discord's. My favorite hobby... Turned so... Corporate.
everypony is critizicing ME just because of the ending
11,01The problem is not bad games. It's good games ruined by bad business practices.
WallDives: lol
a nother dead Turian
Nittany_Discord: what happen?
what are your problems with the game?
11,01And people that actually defend those terrible practices don't help.
11,01RAWRity: it's a long story.
EA's business tactics is bad and they should feel bad
Oh god Nittany is ranting again
eh, guess i'll go to bed then, nighty everyone, and remember: If the movie's directed by Edgar Wright, then it will be alright.
11,01I'm not.
My hands are blue :(
Sumica : did Garrus get a face repair?
11,01I left so I wouldn't rant.
0,14later Dken2021
11,01And I'll leave again if I start.
02drf had iPad dreams D:
11,01Because I don't want to ruin the stream.
11,01And ranting isn't helping the problem, so there's no use.
Sumica : his Armore seems nice agian
Nittany_Discord: well, if you don't want to rant, feel free not to tell me. I'd just like to know. Been out of the loop.
well everypony i have to go to work Sumica goodluck
wat would happen if cyborg shepard joins forces with sweetiebot? :S

Apparently Bioware is going to fix the ending now
Midnight_Tempest: um HHGTG day

Midnight_Tempest: "Dont forget to bring a towel"
Wahaha~
SaxyPretender: psh, this ain't nothing. Its just ancient ruins threatening to collapse on your head. I'd be fine
I played Infamous 2 first. :P It was because my bro got a PS3 for XMAS and got it with the PS3. I do have the first but I haven't played it yet.

I still can't wait for the inevitable MLP movie
:D
Petrified_Discord: that's epic
CrimsonPhoenix: wait what?
Petrified_Discord: I remember that one! It was wicked good
panda please note inevitable
meaning there's no mention of it but I know it'll come
CrimsonPhoenix: I didnt ever think a movie would be inevitable XD
though*
thought*
no stream?
SOON
nope
or is it telstra
:D
just the buffer show
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm not sure if I want a movie of MLP or not...it depends on who does it, and how they do it
has anyone seen otakon lately? :(
panda: nay, i have not
I haven't
no
:( I hope hes ok
panda: perhaps he's merely been busy?
why what happened?
Sylandest: xD perhaps :) he is otakon btw
Sylandest just imagined a 90 minutes lenght of the same style but better quality animation with a deeper more engagin story
imagine**
Tranformers, Battleship, and Clue, MLP is totally next hasbro thing to get movie
if it's Hollywood though....
CrimsonPhoenix: I know, I want that too! But it still stands. It depends on who gets their hands on it and the story for it. more focus on "who" gets it
HASBRO
may Faust be with us
lets hope that HASBRO(ny) doesnt sell out to holywood :( it would ruin everything
panda: i am aware he is otakon...lol

hi ACS13123
holy hell, fluttercry and I came to bronystate on the same night :O
I cant make it to the movie night tonight... or tommorrow :O i dont even know whats being streamed...
I always miss movie night:S
I'm not certain I'd want to make it either, even though Samurai Cop has been cancelled
Yeah, movie nights can be a slight hassle
yus
I might be able to show up tomorrow, but I can't next week
First three days of June, I'm away
so, what exactly was wrong with samurai cop?
Samurai Cop? lol never heard of that
me neither
whats this?
Dungeon Defenders
Oh hey coyboy :)
Polydunami seems to know what it is
hello coyboy
hi coyboy
hello :)
hay coyboy
Actually, I've never heard of the movie until it was announced about 1 or 2 weeks ago
ah
I just know that it was preemptively cancelled
im sure I've heard of that film from somewhere
And now the million dollar question: what are we doing in place of the B movie then?
Samurai Cop sounds like a movie that wasn't very popular, but I dunno haven't seen it:P
G3 episodes?
xD
seems legit
Yeah, maybe that would be better actually
we could show G1 episodes
night
-
Samurai Cop getting cancelled makes me want to see it more...

dont know about you people, but I honestly like G1 G2 and G3
gnigth DaringDude! sleep well!
Sleeping, DaringDude?
zzz... so tired
Night DaringDude
I don't mind them
wub u all :
bye DaringDude
I mean, sure the earlier gens can get a little grating for me, but still
Rain: lol, it's funny to see the reactions when mods stream it
dont mind them either, which makes it fun for me when others cant stand them
Oh yeah, that too xD
i like G1 and G2
I haven't seen much of either
Just G3 and G4
G3 is bareable
I find the reactions annoying. Its a tv show, get over yourselves and stop yelling things like "my eyes!" "Oh god make it stop!"
shit like that is just immature
I was like that once :S
true
Dis game i dont even know the name of...
In a slightly joking way
I like being immature
Dungeon defenders
:P
being immature can be fun sometimes
it can also get the shit slapped out of you
I like having fun sensibly :3
lol red orchestra free weekend on steam
lol
just seen a trailer for Samurai Cop looks like a funny cheesy b movie
Rain: that's true
pffff who needs sensibility?
It's like leaving a bag of burning dog poop on your neighbours doorstep, hmm?
*neighbour's
I've done that before:D

00,10good god almost 50bucks worth of dlc's

2,14 it's worth it
I haz no money
2,14 one of the DLC

MahBoi777: yo dawg i heard you liek space. so we put space in your space so in space for space in space so when you go to space you have space for your space in space when u space
:D
lol Pinkie is best weapon
so it just gives you a rainbow unicorn, Caramel?
i still prefer twi gatling, but pinkie was the user so yeah
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: O U:P
2,14 well, you have to earn it
lol MahBoi777
2,14 you have to complete the assault missions in order to unlock it
does it let you get anymore ponys?
yah
a beter every difficulty
Caramel: want a cookie?
2,14 the pony look varies depending on the difficulty you beat it
2,14 the rainbow one is for beating it on normal
beat it on hardest and what do you get?
Roid Rage lawl
2,14 don't know, I can't beat any nightmare missions yet
ah
2,14 hell, I can't even beat insane yet
i think it was a black badass pony
inb4 its princess Celestia
maybe NMM
:3c
could be the other way around... RD is a decent fighter, harder levels might reward with obstensibly weaker ponies. Flying dresses or bunnies, anyone?
levitation is the only way to travel
that awkward moment when Ghosties was on my friends list before he was on Caramel's >_>
2,14 meh

Hello every pony just wondering what are your opinions on the older generation of MLP?
Personally I think G2 is besat gen
*best
I won't complain about em lol
Funny way to spell G3.6
00,02coyboy, g1 is underrated, not good but not bad
00,02g2 is meh
oh my mistake
00,02and i prefer not to talk about whats betwene 2 and 4
lol^
:D
04Pilot for G1 was awesome
lol
04Best Pre G4 thing there is
00,02^ Ghosties
to be hones pilot g1 is actually really good
04You had demons and monsters and RAINBOWS OF DARKNESS and shit
Pilot is obligatory for new BronyState attendees
00,02i dont think anyone else is awake
haha i loved the 80s shows
00,02phase stream?
04It was like a metal cartoon for little girls
and 80s horror style villains!
they always had demons and monster
monsters*
Phase4 go for it :)
no matter wut show
dat description of G1
04They may as well have had Dio's "Rainbow in the Dark" playing throughout the film
WOOOO Phase4 stream!!!!
lol yeah good old cheesy cartoons
I love that song
04I'm actually not really a fan of metal
04I kinda grew out of it after high school
is there a stream
just imagine that firefly pony teams up with He-Man
one does not simply "outgrow" metal
what Ghosties said
04I did, CJ
Ghosties: i forgot to ask hows the Ghosting going
yes, yes they do, StupidSexyCJ
Poni, poni poni, StupidSexyCJ
00,02mfw i stream to the wrong embed

StupidSexyCJ: u heard party with pinkie
Umm what does this do? OH BALLS TO IT IM GOING BACK TO SAFARI!
dj alex s?
TheRandomkid321: i just lost all respect for u
Shane, hmm, i dont think so
another question every pony. The MLP fanchise is bigger and better then ever before so eventually a video game may be made of MLP. So if there ever was a video game of MLP, what video game genre do you want it to be and who should develop it?
ill link u it after stream
coyboy: My Little Investigations
00,02trying to see whats breaking my thing
omg base cannon
i love this song
TOO MUCH WUB *explodes*
this song makes me think of Perfect Dark for some raison
it's just mah bass canon1
lol if I was being serious I would want a point and click game made by telltale since they are very good at making adaption from comics or movies to video games
mah ears lol
incomming lalala
you mean a game besides fighting is magic?
00,02ok
00,02this video is causing frame drops
00,02why
LALALA incoming DUCK AND COVER PEOPLE
Ah safari. This is much better than that. Mainstream chrome stuff.
:D
lalalalalalal
T+BEST GREETING EVER
lalalalalalalala
dat LALALA
But... No video... Only sound?
all bronies please stand
Hi Vinyl.
this place doesn't have enough lalala
00,02STOP DROPPING FRAMES
One of Chrome's advantages is that it has Flash player built-in, IIRC.
My safari has been a dick latley. Just because I force it too hard.
Oh, and I just joined reddit yesterday
i see lalala
I can't stop coming
but i hear somethign else
Just out of curiosity. RUle 34 doesnt have viruses. Right?
00,02o_O
TheRandomkid321: Nope.
:I
ANyway Im on a mac... JUST FOR REFERNCE
/me snickers

d3rb: i think it is
wait. its good but buffery
00,02d3rb, yup ^_^
wow....i've never seen one lol
The screen switching on Linix is waaaaay better than Window 7's
looks pretty pimp
*Linux
00,02nope, broken
lets just blame apple
SO uhh. Everyones bufffering right?
I blame everything on publishers
ya huhh
i'm buffering
everythiiiiiiing

thesilence.... ITS KILLING ME!
00,02:P
lol

SCreen ception.. DUHN!
screenception
00,02yeah, this is not working so well
00,02which is anoying :(
Hm... school's coming for me, looks like I can save money to get those Steam games on my wishlist
Thsi time. I have made sure that this glitter gue is non-toxic... NOM!
damn what OS do u have
thegt90: Linux
lol Spell-of-Gaming
witch one
Well, ask Phase4, not me
:P
00,02thegt90, archlinux
thefinebros blocked videos made by other reaction videos :o
so Phase4, what is the advantage of a linux system? not trying to start a my os is better than your os debate, i really know very little about linix other than i belive its less compatible with stuff (which may not be true anymore)
If ya dont know your OS here. thsi will help ya... But who the buck desont know their os? http://www.moanmyos.com/
lol bewbies
umm....
valoreins: If I'm not mistaken, they were releasing a new React series
Haven't check their channel, though.
Spell-Of-Gaming yeah. Elders react. The first episode is out. its nyan cat :3
00,02d3rb, its fast, open, and gives no fucks. you ask it to do something and it will do it
yup, turns out a channel already has elders react videos before them
...Elders react?
sweet
PFFFFFFFT
Heyo guys
HAHAHAHA
lol
00,02d3rb, srsly, you can pry out parts of the boot system and replace them
but then thefinebros became dicks and blocks all stillcosmo's videos
Elders react is my favorite of all the reacts mainly because its got people who i respect... Elders... I get beat up daily...
They need an elders react to my little pony FIM.
00,02allso linux has sane file permisions
and you've lost me, im not a computer noob but I'm probably very casual by your standards
So.. No stream anymore?
00,02d3rb, ever had that problem where you just cant open or share a file? none of that on linux, its super simple
Its gawn. FOREVAR
Ill brb guys.
I'll look into linux a bit more, educate myself

I think I'll be installing Linux if Windows quits using 32-bit
So, whos gonna stream now?
why would you want 32 bit? 64 is more, more is better....probably
Yeah
64 is best nintendo
^
True
Maybe if I wasn't lazy to install 64-bit :I
Brony123, we dont normally stream 24 hours of the day here
00,02i know
00,02lets watch pony
:D
D:
Plus, not all programs support 64, yet :I
hooray for Phase4
YO YO YO WHAT ABOUT DEM PONIES
Wait, so you install 64 bit?
but 64 bit windows still can operate 32 bit programs
HUURRAHH!
YES
OH GOD so many ponies

If you can't fix it with duct tape, it can't be fixed.
Good thing I quit the Ponymon wiki before it became full of shitheads

I don't really have a fav episode. Even the bad ones are pretty :$
these bloopers kinda ruins the show for me

Fun fact: Ponyville is late for spring each year, because they perform that music number for every newcomer.
I'll quit the wiki EVER EVER EVER EVER
Ponymon? What's that?

Ponymon is a fan project, which is not bad. Actually, it's awesome

=.(\ how obvious
00,02nice footage of 70's melbourne there
I would laugh so hard if this song was replaced with the Pokemon Bike Theme or Earthbound Bike Theme, which still has the video.
00,02XD
Spell-of-Gaming: Wait, how do i paste it into paint? Like, just press the paste hot key and it'll paste, or do i need to find it in a folder somewhere?
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, i'll have to do that sometime
wee
Nabronyan: You can use the paste hotkey
Ok, but that didn't work.
And I don't see it in any folder

Too much education at once
Phase4: the stream seems to buffer every time you change video
Anyone notice my name btw
Needs more Animaniacs
Here is EXACTLY what it says :

00,02XAX, it will do that
Nabronyan: Have you reseted?

00,02later RainbowAsh
When this song was popular, no one at my school could say no if i asked them if they had it on their phone >_>
Nabronyan, yup, but that's weird
what is he actually saying there?
Later RainbowAsh
Wait, Im playing Dusk. Should I be playing Dawn?

Wait, when I went to download the Emulator
It said I may have needed to download uh

Nabronyan: Do you have DirectX already?
i do

But I dunno if I do. Should I DL it anyway?
Nabronyan, I say do it.

Phase4 thanks. I recently saw some of this special coding competition videos, and they have similar style
Ghosties: cough newborn cuties
Wrek, give them the biggest tea party if they ask for ponies.
Invi: I want you to stay alive to see "ponies".
Well, I have to go in 14 minutes anyway.

at least g3 looks like SOME effort was put in, lmfao is ear poison
Hello ponyloverforeva
Phase4: for example
Even better, my new car's ready. :)

Phase4: cool story bro needs more ponies

Erry day they're bufferin'.

Malavolent lol
They would be very surprised I watch G3.
Hello everypony

00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, the movie was ok
d3rb: I never herd of it untill there song
<_<
?
Its just like the original, but with lyrics like "Put your hoofes","we will make you loose your mane" and "Mister Discords in the house tonight"
|Discord|, g1 isn't half bad, if you compare it to other shows of the time, and if you skip over all songs but sea ponies
Lil_B: YOU KNOW IAM
Lil_B: "Put your hooves!"
Combat Arms anypony played that before
i guess i got an advantage being from melbourne, still they took our dance and destroyed it
this sounds ... peaceful

Lil_B: "Mister Discord's in the house tonight."
...what's this?
Well?
00,02i love this music too

Lil_B: ;_;

Eurobeat: But of course we all have our Wishes

I would like to hear something from Koji Kondo

imagine bstate 2nd anniversary
that would be cool
the rainbow dash and scootaloo picture is freaking me out
24/7 ponies
like the Nazo no Murasame Jo Main Theme XD
serch rainbow factory (INSANE)
click the first thing
then thats the image
Eurobeat i hate that fic
i do to
rainbow dash will never kill scootaloo
yay
I never really read a fic, I'm not much of an reader :/
even if she felt like it
screw scootaloo
..
00,02pony_911, :<
Oh yeah, old timey music
dem smooth beats
I heard that tune in Parodius first!
What song is this?
Trixies Funhouse is worser then the factory fic
and the cupcakes fic
i read it before i felt like puking
my vid keep buffering every 2 seconds !! ARGHHH:[
Phase4: You streaming? =3
Vynil's grandma was a jazzist :D
00,02VDXRetrotainment, yup
really?
Mind if I do one single request?
so, we're in radio mode?
well... Octavia COULD use her contrabass to play Jazz
Rainbow fun factory?
im wtaching that right now.. o-o
Eurobeat: don't read those fanfics. They'll never be canon and just gross you out.
rainbow and factories just dont add up
actually, i found cupcakes not half bad
i found trixie needed money
dancing offbeat to the song, good video XD
00,02VDXRetrotainment, feel free
MadSurge, I thought it was a defining element of fanfiction that they never would be canon... at least not intentionally
MadSurge btw whats canon is it the song?
Phase4: imagine 24/7 ponies on bstate 2nd year anniversary
Well, i read a "Clopfic" once, because i thought it was hilarious
then she cut applebloom or scootaloo in half with a chainsaw
rainbow factory was... strange, trixies funhouse or whatever was plain overdone and decidedly gross. but cupcakes actually did something right
Dark
what?
Lil_B: that's the only way to take bad fanfics for me :D
ddam it google
Did you read trixes funhouse?
why did u close bstate
did you puke?
WHY NO NEW PONIES?!??!?!
i dont get why cupcakes gets so much attention, its pretty average
when do we get new ponies?!
the only fic that i finished is "my little alicorn"
Guys, lower volume D:
MelaPonie: ur such a troll
pony_911, "canon" means facts of a fictional world as defined by the stories themselves and maybe word of the creator. The opposite is "fanon",i.e. what watchers would like to believe to be true in the world, but what hasn't been defined yet.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane, i r no troll...
i think i might have glanced at it. think i stopped after a few paragraphs and did something else
when do we get new ponies?
MelaPonie: shuddup... troll
MadSurge yes, I just like over the top Stuff, that doesn'Ät take itself seriously
MelaPonie: in september
Trixies Funhouse... isnt fun
/me licks Alicorn_Prince_Shane
MelaPonie: ISH
not for a long time MelaPonie
d3rb, the popularity of cupcakes is purely meme-driven in my opinion.
its in a warehouse..
RainbowAsh ...so basically its mean good then
o hai claude
:*(
HERE IT COMES!
u in english class again Claude
september :*(
could be worse i guess!
Epic new age classic music. <3
I LOVE THAT SONG!
Lil_B: excellent :)
OVATIONS!
:D
dat MUSIC
Spiderjack is really funny
but i prefer "Beethoven's Virus"
NEXT PART
GO
Octavia approves!
watch it its so funny XD
Dem fingers...
Next part! TRUMPET
DAT HARPIST
dude... what do you call that?
COME ON RAMON!
And FINISH
pony_911, for instance, Pinkie having spent her childhood on a rockfarm is canon, because it was mentioned in the show. Scootaloo being an orphan is fanon, because, while her family is never shown, it has never been really stated outright one way or another.
my stream is frozen still i cant watch anything:[
Lyra could play like this... if she had Fingers... (wtf am i saying i don't even like all those background ponys?!)
my little pwny
Sayaka! Compensate. <3
muahahah
any idea if that'S a genre?
does anypony had a spare $5 lying around? i really want poker night at the inventory on steam. dem tf2 items you get from it...
This makes me wish I had taken my violin lessons more seriously
i play the piano
RainbowAsh: Same. :(
pony_911: try ztrl f5, probably wont fix it but worth a shit
shot**
:D
pony_911: :D

o-o
can someone link where to send in lottery stuff......
00,02trip time
MadSurge, because lack of love and tolerance. Bronies in general wish they wouldn't be treated badly by the mainstream, but treat r34ers just the same.

I wouldn't mind if a pegasus has pyrokinetic powers
after singerplayer the finished
well of to play tf2
:o
Pyro pegasi? You been reading Crisis:Equestria Spell-of-Gaming?
TO MY LITTLE MERCERIES
pony_911: not to be confused with PLAYING online, just most games require you to be online in some form.
actually, imma go wash up real quick...be back in a little bit, everypony. Don't go getting into trouble now!
05so no one here owns D3 and would like to play with me?
Spell-of-Gaming: i fire lazors out of my wings
I don't even know that, Meanwhile
bye guys
I cant afford D3.
Wrek: i would loved to if i had it
Spell-of-Gaming: Fair enough.
Bye pony_911
bai pony_911
WallDives: I am with you there.
how much is D3?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :|
? Twi_Fi
I'm just Earthbound-obsessed. :P
Wrek: I have it but....i dont have a character/havent played it yet >.>
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: About the lazors coming out of your wings.
RaveBrony: what.
haha Twi_Fi
You have it but you...haven't played it?
05RaveBrony then make one
05(on EU)
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
RaveBrony: I only own Diablo II...
Error. Unable to resolve. Rebooting.
Getting Diablo III soon.
Spell-of-Gaming: the cutie marks as a alicorn but a alicron oc is op
/me is gonna be a Demon Hunter
hey um who's the one in charge of bronystate emails?
quick question. the ToS doesnt allow talking about drugs... but being strictly technical. alsohol is a drug. so... would it be okay to talk about recommendations about alcohol?
Ill see what i can do...i dont even know how the game works yet x_x
I'm not sure if any one mod is assigned to handling the bronystate email dshannon.
"the ToS doesnt allow talking about drugs"
RaveBrony: Wrek will teach like a new language
ah
That's false
it does not prohibit talking about drugs directly, but it prohibits encouraging illegal actions
well
Meanwhile: u gonna curl the mo?
RaveBrony: its easy! all you have to do is: clickclickclickclickclickclickclickcCLICKCLICKCLICKclickclick
Wat.
Alcohol is not illegal (in most places), so, for most people, talking about alcohol is 100% okay.
Meanwhile: ur mustache
and thats how you play Diablo.
If you encourage a minor to drink alcohol, that might be an issue.
just checking ^^ thanks Kabaka
/me jumps backonto Alicorn_Prince_Shnae
My moustache curls itself.
Meanwhile: lol
Claude: lol
Meanwhile: lucky, mine wont.
I did my exam :3

Claude: howd u go
Claude: how d'you think you did?
v well
Claude: did u fail?
jks
I think I'll get 17/25
Yeah, that is a weird area for international communities.

Cake
CAKE!
You all like ponies? lolwut? ;)

IIRC, U.N. Owen is a bias used to describe a person who invites 10 random people to an island, killing them each.
Spell-of-Gaming: Awesome book :D
05all songs playign are from sabatosn newest album
Sylandest: Its from sabaton Lejonet Fran norden

nope
stream is running fine, Sylandest.
must've lagged out
lol
Lag!
Lag, the best excuse for being a moron on WoW
Om: ehehe :$
hrhr
Lag, the reason me winning a fight leads to me being caught in a 33 hit combo.
Did something wrong? it was lag
bleh.
Lag: The alternate excuse for "My sister/brother did it!"
Precicely
Spell-of-Gaming: now if only it worked at the workplace...lol
never heard that one (probably because it wont fly)
"Why are you not doing your work!?"
Uhhhh lag?
"Oh, that's okay then."
..
Om: :"I lagged out, sir! My internet's playing up!"
Did someone say Lag?!?
Om: "Fix your internet, Johnson! *tableflip*
Sylandest: lol
you know whats annoying? when the only people playing have a ping of 200ms.
I bet.
Not much you can do about that tho.
Having a ping of 200ms bothers me sometimes
WallDives: I remember playing on my old computer, like way back, I would have so much trouble moving in Dalaran. I avoided it like the plague, lol
haha i just had a awesome idea
in a fighting game, thats a slide-show.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: do tell
100ms is rough. 200ms is unplayable.
some pony put the tone of their alarm on their phone to the shooo beee dooo sea ponies
and puts message saying for when alarm goes off the sea ponies are calling
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: rofl. That would make for some interesting reactions where I am
Sylandest: why lol?
HIYA EVERYPONY!!!!
hey sith
I remember the incomprehencably large lag spikes you could get in WoW. Somewheres up at 8000ms -_- I don't think it was really that
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Well, my region isn't exactly full of brony-friendly folk...lol. I might get a bible or something chucked at me
Allo Bronysith. Break your caps lock?

VioletGreySha: neat =P I can just take em from the picture though =P

Alicorn_Prince_Shane: protip, I REALLY dont care. I'm poking fun at you.

Om: Beacuse the us wants to be "unique" xD
Meanwhile: No kidding.
Blowdown: cause their special
Luna: totally agreed :D
Luna: we are indeed a silly place...
Om: It's probably the diet.
alexxm: It's been okay.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: hard to breath to
Airpuff: Oh were unique alright. Not sure if thats good.
I mean, I finally got the meters to feet... and inches to centimeters
Nerom: u learn quickly

[Desktop]JRP2234: and [WUB]JRP2234 so much JRP
oh god those things
They are so tasty
:c
I need a cup of tea. brb.
I find one thing odd
Om: I dont like how the US gouvernment strive to become the "top" of the world though, pumping out more than enough atomic bomb to blow the world to nothingness.. Its the Us and Russia xD
/me makes Meanwhile a cup of tea
of all the things that are now infested with bronies, Guildwars2 does not seem to be one of those things
need more coffee. brb
Nerom: diggy diggy hole
who should we kill first
I'm a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
alexxm: :O
I think I'm gonna go play me some league of legends...I'll be back later, everypony. Ya'll have fun now! Don't cause too much trouble!
though, lewis>simon
alexxm: kill Ninjazz|PingWenNeede first

Airpuff: If you belive some of the conspiracy theoryies, the US does far worse than that.
Bye Sylandest
why him Ninjazz
c ya Sylandest
bai Sylandest
if you believe some of the conspiracy theories you're probably paranoid
what Twi_Fi
Om: xD
Ohh tea I want some :P wonder if we have some at home... And if my half litre mug is clean
alexxm: I saw you ask, "Who should we kill first?"
/me hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane, Invi, Twi_Fi, and alexxm
does far worse than what Om
alexxm: So I was shocked.
Blowdown: there was a conspiracy theory about geogre bush or bill clinton giving arms to bin laden that turned out to be tru
sorry Twi_Fi
Blowdown what if you are agnostic about some?
I'm agnostic about all
and so is everyone else
/me hugs Twi_Fi
/me flicks his hair
actualy, scrap that
agnostic only covers nonbelievers that can't proof shit
alexxm: Use atomic weapons as a threat.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane hey I'm still in there
alexxm: :)
but in the end, noone knows
thanks Om
oh soz Invi
/me catches Invi
alexxm: But I don't really want to get started on a debate about goverment.
no, let's start one about religion!
just leave it their then Om
('-')/
never argue about politics in a chat
How small is invi O.o if he fits in Alicorn_Prince_Shane's mane
Back.
the government totally sucks....
Nerom: haveu seen the pic?
Nerom I'm not small, Alicorn_Prince_Shane's mane is huge
nope
hey Meanwhile hows your day been
cachi01: The government always totally sucks. Everywhere. Fact of life.
the sad part is that noone can do better
Politics and religion are two topics that are sure to create chaos in chat.
my mane is the same as mustafa's
the government is destined to suck, it's just their job to make it suck a little less
What if talk about politics and religion at the same time!
:D
haha Meanwhile
religious politicians, dear go dno
do you mean mufasa Alicorn_Prince_Shane
alexxm: soz patato potato
Well that pic don't say much about yer size
-if you know what I mean
religion is the worst tpoic
that's what she said?
How bout them PONIES!?!?!?!
Nerom: thats me
Neat

We're having some kind of meta conversation here.
PONIES where?

We're discussing the discussion of things. >_>
wait i thought ya had a horn
they swear by celestia
what do you think we are Invi
Invi: yea its called Friendship
Invi: Friendship
With Celestia as my witness!
Friendship, we must study it!
I think they worship celestia as some kind of diety
Nerom: i decided to make it a pegasi cause OC alicorns are siri
not quite, but kinda
Nerom: plus im not super powerful alicorn
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :O
applejack needs to be a pegasus
What have you learned about friendship today,fillies and foals?
if u give pinkie pie wings shits gonna go down

I learned that strawberry laces give me heartburn.
Well true.... I can say the same I have not even showed th wings on my oc yet.. he has a cloak. ;P
Invi: that fillies love my mane?
lol Nerom
Meanwhile: ouchie
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: you should look into surprise, you'll like it
Alicorn_Prince_Shane was that really new to you?
Invi: shhh

Alicorn_Prince_Shane: She's called surprise, hold on
why don't people like it when you threaten to put them in the cage of justice
Nerom: is that u
Blowdown: lol k
Twi_Fi you will learn something today, else Celestia will send you too the moon
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: mind the RP. and dont mess with my coffee.
In child/ foal form yes
Invi: TO DA MOON!

/me throws coke on WallDives
Nerom: An alicorn with red eyes. Very original. /sarcastic face.
how hard is this game
/me flying tackles Meanwhile
alexxm: so hard that u already lost it
Invi: Actually a new day has begun for me seven minutes ago, so I'm already screwed. :(
As a rule of thumb I generally hate OC's anyway.
Nah its not... also th eyes on that pic sucks I will prob change it
/me is hit by a low flying Claude.
Meanwhile: want to see my oc?
alexxm: It's perdy difficult, but it's really difficult on Nightmare
/me hugs Meanwhile
now time to get some tea
Twi_Fi no it counts 'till now ^^
Not as much as I want to disect a frog Bronysith.
thanks Suprise
/me gives Meanwhile cookie *(/

Sylandest: I bet I could turn you into a unicorn pretty fast. ;)
WallDives: i knew an englishman named brandon bates. so we called him Master Bates
and someone whose last name is Handwerker.(no, this one is serious. poor guy.)
Om: Just put the prefix "pro" and the word "creation" together, Ommy. ;)
GilDash: w-what? But I like being an earth pony! And how would you do that anyway?
WallDives: I actually knew a guy called Richard Head. Blackbelt in Tang Soo Do too. :D

Sylandest: Stop thinking literally for a minute. ;)

Meanwhile: one does not simply know what the fuck u just say?
I have a game to coach tonight...
Airpuff|Drawing: let go of him
Airpuff|Drawing: NOW
Dken2021: :[
Sylandest: That is your job.
/me shakes his head at Alicorn_Prince_Shane "No."
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: help...meep...*still hovering in air*
Airpuff|Drawing: if thats alright with u :(
cachi01|FFXIII-2: FFVI and FFVII are best final fantasies.
Airpuff|Drawing: filly
Bronysith: FFT gets no love?
Bronysith: yeah i know
Bronysith: I'm gonna let you finish, but FFI was the best FF of all time!
Bronysith that's not how you spell Final Fantasy IV
cause FFT was awesome. 12 was good, although gambits can go die.
/me grabs Airpuff|Drawing and seperates the grab between the,
WallDives: X is one of my fav plots. but i did not like the combat
/me hugs Airpuff|Drawing
i haz cookie Airpuff|Drawing
Dat plot.
Also, Phantasy Star NEVER gets any love.
ALL THE FF's WERE BAD..... ...joking :3
Meanwhile: one does not simply mount a plot
FlareChaser|Octavia: u best be
...
Bronysith: I love Final Fantasy :|
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY choose between kefka and sephiroth
Yeah actually I never liked any FF.
we'll see about that Bronysith
kefka
/me giggles at Alicorn_Prince_Shane and takes the cookie before keeping on moving Sylandest around with magic
KEFKA is best villain
WallDives I liked that game on the dreamcast, if only I had a way to connect to the internet
I don't really like JRPG's.
EVAER
/me dragged away by Airpuff|Drawing "Um...do I get any say here?" :$
/me levitates Airpuff|Drawing and put s him in candy mane
Dken2021: I mean the original tetrology. Phantasy Star 1-4.
KEFKA IS THE MADDEST and best joker
not PSO, although I owned that.
Bronysith: Kefka is a good villian, Dark Falz is best villian.
WallDives: oooh the hours i logged into that game
oh
/me keeps on moving Sylandest around with magic "No. You dont have a say"
yo
WallDives: WRONG kefka destroys the world
Bronysith: Lv186 RAcast at server shutdown.
flutter_shy: hi there
what about Golbez? he's pretty much the final fantasy's Darth Vader!
In soviet russia, world destroys kefka
Airpuff|Drawing: wittle Airpuff|Drawing wanna sleep?
lol
and darth vader's pretty cool
bronysith hi
/me glares at Alicorn_Prince_Shane "No. Im playing now."
/me dances on Sylandest "hi Airpuff|Drawing "
Dken2021: yes. but kefka is best video game villain
DeathStar: what did panda say?
Airpuff|Drawing: play nice with Sylandest
Bronysith: Dark Falz destroyed 5 planets, was sealed, woke up after 1000 years, destroyed a star system, leading to another series over 4 games.
/me waves at DeathStar "Hai"
DeathStar: >.< why is everypony doing this to me? XD
Bronysith: he hassn;t replied
/me hands a gun to Sylandest whispers ' just in case"
Bronysith: kefka is best FF villian, Dark Falz is better.
WallDives: Kefka wanted to destroy the world cause he is incredibly bored
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: one minute, im an anonymous pony, the next I'm everypony's plaything...*sigh*
Sylandest: because we love you!
WallDives: what game is dark falz froma gain?
Bronysith: Phantasy Star.
Sylandest: thats Airpuff|Drawing for u
DeathStar: awwww :)
WallDives: ooh yea
Sylandest: You werent the only one to get that treatment.
wat da video
/me stares at Alicorn_Prince_Shane before setting up a protective barrier of wind around himself.... "Just in case".....
also, Phantasy Star predates FF.
alexxm: i am impressed
so, theres that.
Om: true...but I seem the only one as of late, lol
guys
You are once again reminded that this is not an RP channel.
/me wubbles Airpuff|Drawing
/me owns the SNES version of FF3.
I think I might play TF2.
:|
thanks Princess_Molestia
Sylandest: No one is happer of that, than I.
FlareChaser|Octavia: do it. do eeet
alexxm: prepare ur anus
Meanwhile: lol
/me puts down Sylandest ..... "Im bored of this.."
Om: well, if it makes you feel better, I guess that makes it ok :) lol
its TF2time
Idk why that's funny Alicorn_Prince_Shane.
FlareChaser|TF2: could i join in on the fun?
/me is back on the ground "oh ty celestia..."
/me glomps Bronysith
Bronysith: the secret butt fun?
Bronysith: you have a duty to fulfill
Airpuff|Drawing: can i have him?
Meanwhile: im gonna love and tolerate the shit out of u
It isn't. And if folks don't knock it off they're going to get kicked into space.
Sylandest: Sure it does. Have fun now
Princess_Molestia: could i plz go and play tf2 first?
/me teleports to the top of Sylandest 's head and dances with DeathStar "Nope" before he giggles
Bronysith: but yeah, sure :|
fine Bronysith
Meanwhile: theres 2 types of rp 1 shitz and gigglez 2 the srs wierd shit
Meanwhile: kicked quicker than John Terry from the national team.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i have two ponies dancing on my head...I now sympathize with you and your mane usage...XD
/me gets off Bronysith
zing!
Meanwhile: and if u check the rule it says "Excessive"
/me dances with Airpuff|Drawing awww ok
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Neither of which are allowed in here in excess.
It's been going on for like half an hour -_-
Sylandest: Airpuff|Drawing DeathStar lower the RP k
Bronysith: he said yes
DeathStar: aight whats ur skype name?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: sure thing, np :$ sorry if I bothered anypony
Meanwhile: if so ur in the wrong place lol
/me lowers the rp
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: What?
I has no idea whats going on here..
/me lowers rp and returns to drawing
see Meanwhile if u want to get something done u have to say it nicely
shouting only works if ur in the army
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Being nice isn't the point, the rules are.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: would u kindly come over here
which we are obv not in
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: it also works if you're a coach.
/me runs away
dat too WallDives
run, Alicorn_Prince_Shane, run!
your goind to love me :[ :P
flutter_shy: we already love you, silly filly
Meanwhile: stop being such a nanny calm da fuck down
:P
Sylandest: speak for yourself.
hai hai hai
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I'm perfectly calm, I just want the rules acknowledged.
hi Derpy_at_work.
Meanwhile: its called "fun"
The mods didn't put that list together so you could ignore them.
Meanwhile: remeber it says excessive rp
WallDives: well, I do! I love everypony on here, without question
By the way Meanwhile if the mods dont tell us that we are crossing the line you have nothing to support us getting kicked to space. Just ask next time
Sylandest: lies, hearsay, and shenanigans, and you know it.
You will not win this argument.
" Bronystate is not an RP channel, and as such, excessive Role-Playing is discouraged. "
see it says excessive
Excessive being anything more than hugs generally.
And you've been more than excessive.
Meanwhile: There is nothing saying Rp isnt allowed to a certain degree
/me sighs
WallDives: no really, I do! Though shenanigans are fun...
And I've ignored you up until now Airpuff|Drawing.
Meanwhile: go twirl ur mustache someplace else
Just use some discretion, if you guys want to RP, you can do it elsewhere
Sylandest: btw, its fun and funny as hell to yell that IRL.
I've been twirling my moustache in here for a year, and I will continue to twirl it here.
Meanwhile: Excessive is pointed more against roleplay that are against the ruels and might be and offence
Meanwhile: Fight the power!
WallDives: Shenanigans? I do it at work when there's no customers and my co-workers are bored, hehe
lol
haha Sylandest
Airpuff|Drawing: Don't assume your interpretation of the rules is somehow more correct than mine.
Meanwhile: lighten up
Meanwhile: well i do, beacuse rp isnt against the rules
Sylandest: no, I mean yelling "LIES, HEARSAY AND SHENANIGANS!"
Do you not see dari's message up there? ^
WallDives: oh, i see...I'll have to try that next time, lol
Airpuff|Drawing: its excessive which u do sometimes
Meanwhile: shuddup
05close battle
this is obviously gonna turn into a shit storm
05hate those wasps
It obviously won't if you just read the rules and follow them.
so every shuddup and watch wrek
Wrek: dont we all?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: mind giving me an example then?
I call leeroy jenkins on this situation
Meanwhile: just watch the dam stream
Sylandest: hell, I did it yesterday after getting caught in a combo. "lies, this is all lies, lemons, more lies, hearsay and shenanigans!"
go wrek go!
Wrek: -lol- I thought they were fireflys. But yeah I deffinetly underestimated those bugs and got owned....a lot.
Meanwhile: We follow the rules that is why we can rp here, beacuse we dont cross the line.
WallDives: you got caught in a combo? how does one do that?
Sylandest: play fighting games.
lawl, whatchyou streaming Wrek?
and screw up.
WallDives: aaaahhhh, now i get it
Airpuff|Drawing: Yes it does cross the line at times
sometime Airpuff|Drawing it does
05dispeys herkules
Derpy_at_work: diablo3
Derpy_at_work: omg...I love your name.
eg just b4
Sylandest: where do you think I got the name from?
Airpuff|Drawing: Excessive rp is generally anything that goes beyond a brief exchange. Excessive is a dialogue and played out scenario.
WallDives: I actually had no idea...some things slip by me, hehehe :$
Meanwhile: well its wierd the mods dont kick for that then Meanwhile
Meanwhile is right in my opinion.
Sylandest: actually, NO ONE has caught it without me pointing it out.
What constitutes excessive is at the discretion of the mod, and what he said fits that.
WallDives: well, what does "walldives" mean then? I'm curious now
some people notice it, but don't mind
If you guys want to RP, why not take it to another channel, and not risk annoying mods and other members in here?
i say its up to the streamer
it's up to both the streamer and the mods, Alicorn_Prince_Shane
I'm not always around to see what you guys are doing.
Or I would.
the mods are here to keep this chat pleasant for all
Perhaps for the sake of these kinds of exchange that rule should be expanded upon.
If you want, I can outright ban anyone I thin is being excessive
Then we won't have any repeat offenses.
Because I've seen people kicked time and time again for excessive RP, and not take notice of it.
thank you Blowdown, and thank you Kid_Cobalt :3
We do, but you don't seem to be taking heed of it.
The mods don't have to give anything.
tbh some people dont understand theres 2 kinds of RP first theres in for shitz and gigglez and theres the srs nonsense
If you want to RP, do it elsewhere.
Airpuff|Drawing: You aren't helping your case any
That's a warning.
Airpuff|Drawing: just shh
Meanwhile: actually, yea, mods do have to give warnings
the cave of burrowing horror sounds like a pleasant place
According to whom.
They'll warn you out of courtesy
alexxm: its quite nice, i vacationed there once
Airpuff|Drawing: no point arguing with a mod
Meanwhile: just because they're above us doesn't mean they have their own rules, they have to be fair when judging a situation
But this is their chat and they enforce the rules here at individual discretion.
Airpuff|Drawing: u'll never win
alexxm: Good place to build a summer home
Derpy_at_work is a op in a channel called #ponyroleplay - that is a channel specifically made for RP. If you want to RP do it in a channel such as that.
Airpuff|Drawing: just stop\
whats it like Om
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: just beacuse she is a mod i have no reason to just give up and no i wont. Im jsut talking my case here.
05each and everytime someone RPs in here, i tell them to stop. they stop for 1-5 minutes and then they are back to doign it again
I am a mod, I can enforce the rules however I see fit.
05over and over
forever
05so its tehir own fault
righto Airpuff|Drawing but trust me no point aruging with a mod
so you can in fact ban anyone that breaks a rule, immediatly, even if it's a minor offense?
05Alicorn_Prince_Shane. there is a difference between arguign and discussing
i understand Airpuff|Drawing ur voicing u opinon
alexxm: Dark, sometimes quiet. And a bit musty. Neighbers don't bother you to much
note to myself: dont battle atlas in his full power mode
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i have no reason to stop arguing with a mod if i feel it is right
actually.. yea you do
Wrek: im trying to say to Airpuff|Drawing hes not gonna get anything out of it
ive learnt the hard way
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: if a mod can "enforce" the rules in ANY way they see fit it is redicolus. No matter the autority of the mod, they should follow the lines of the rules or else they might as well not have them at all.
why is everypony arguing?
leave me out of this
well
Well put it this way Airpuff, you have been warned now, if I see you RPing here beyond what I view as acceptable, I will give you an hours ban.
i dont want to piss the mods off
ded
oh shiz, wrek died
ded
Them lazers get you alot wrek
LAZERS!
cachi01|FFXIII-2: discussion of rules
as soon as you break a rule, the mods are in their right to punish you for that, however immediatly banning for a minor offense isn't something a mod can just do... if they did they probably won't be mods for long
oh
-if- you have been warned though, then it's just your fault
I knaw on old car tyres. It helps strengthen my jaw incase of a bear attack.
lol TheRandomkid321
Airpuff|Drawing: This will sound rude but. Shut up.
Seconded.
hey TheRandomkid321 hows your day been
gonna have to agree with him there, you're argueing for the sake of argueing, not a good thing
SO who eb streamin?
wrek is
Wrek be streaming.
Om: lol i dont care. If she dosent follow the bottom lines and take excessive rp ans rp in generall its redicolus -.-
Wrek is

05the problem is when theres the "wingboner from touching exampledude1" and so on
05you get the point
Ninjazz: rough day, i take it?
lol
Airpuff|Drawing: Yes. You made it my problem, and I don't apriciate that.
Airpuff|Drawing your point is irrelevant, you've been given an ultimatum. You need to accept that.
how come Ninjazz
Airpuff|Drawing: Note the rule that if you have a problem with the rules that you discuss these in PM's or emails
hey Airpuff|Drawing you have a DA account?
someone tell me when people are done playing pitchabitch.
Sylandest: Something like that...
walldives never!
alexxm: Losing friends and stuff...
/me hugs Ninjazz
Ninjazz: we're here for you, bud
Dat GilDash|Fajita
/me hugs Ninjazz
Lol all im saying is that its stupid to take rp as excessive itself.
my watch broke. NOW I HAVE A POCKET WATCH! but seriously I need a replacement. I have been looking into pocket watches. See if I can find a moderatly cheap one.
Thanks guys.
/me hugs Ninjazz

Hey... Let's stop arguing...

Airpuff|Drawing: Then shut up. It you would be so kind.
WallDives: Wasn't that much of a spam.
Airpuff|Drawing: honestly, did you even listen to what has been said so far?:| no offense, but you're just making a fool out of yourself by this point
The point of this wasn't to be rude.
Knock it off.
/me Alicorn_Prince_Shane "Help me up pwease :3"
Ello there, everypony.
Blowdown: I've heard all that has been said. All i am saying is taht it is bad for the mods to be able to bend and use the rules completely in their favor
/me is bored of Xbox

the problem is that people dont know how to moderate themselves...
/me hugs Claude
No thanks Claude.
cachi NICE what is it?
rofl
Hey FlareChaser|TF2 you alive?
I haven't reacted to your case, I'm mostly pointing out that what you're doing right now is -not- the solution to your problem
whatever. I'm not having any of this. get me when things cool down.
TheRandomkid321: worstseedever
TheRandomkid321: no joke thats the seed xD
Blowdown: The only reason im still going is beacuse some people in here are being assholes and are taunting me to keep going saying that my case and arguments are shit. That is why i am angry. If you cant argue with someone without going for a personal insults. dont comment at all
TheRandomkid321: and its pretty cool
>:/
Ok then
Meanwhile why you no ant cookie
TheRandomkid321: there will be a pit with sand and rocks infront of you
That will be my final word in the matter.
Try fluttershy. On the PC edition it used to e a crescent moon shaped island with a single tree on it.
TheRandomkid321: get into the pit and get rid of the sand
Airpuff|Drawing: Creampuffs, is now the final word.
TheRandomkid321: u should find a dungeon
Alright simmer down folks.
/me simmers
Meanwhile: Yes master.
chachi. Seems a lil suspiciou... HEROBRINE!
Om: what?
Meanwhile: what's simmer anyway?
/me is dutch, blame him
TheRandomkid321: xd silly filly herobrine is just an old pony tale
Airpuff|Drawing: Creampuffs, they are filled with cream around a beacked flakey bread crust
Okei..?
I... feel... sick...
I've just played Story of blank flanks.
Pretty creepy for 8 bit MLP game.
ah, my general workday, thank you:D
how come TheRandomkid321
Does anyone have any good first person shooter gaems for OSX?
chachi01 NO HE IS REAL!
Malavolent: come on story of the blanks isnt creepy
05TheRandomkid321: yes. look up aleph one
story of the blanks Malavolent?
alexxm I- I dont know
Malavolent: luna game and dreamy rainbow those are creepy
Story of the Blanks. I quite liked that.
05at source.bungie.org TheRandomkid321
cachi01|FFXIII-2: Those are both games?
cachi01|FFXIII-2: Those arn't even games... Just screamers.
alexxm: Yep, it's a pony game.
i thought it was a bit too short Malavolent
Ninjazz: luna game 0 and 4 are games
dreamy rainbow 3 also is a game
cachi01|FFXIII-2: Hardly...
Where have I heared this song before?
I'm hesistant of looking at "creepy" pony things since last time :'(
alexxm: Yeah, it is but it's still pretty neat.
Good idea, Blowdown. Just no natural...
what did you see last time Blowdown
Ninjazz: Aye its a bit creepy.
a bit? :$
Theres a pony coming right at me o_o
Malavolent i have a theory at cutie pox is connected to what happened i story of the blanks
Hug it Gunthler
Ninjazz: Only a bit
alexxm: What is cutie pox?
What would consider alot? :$
Ninjazz: 30bits
lol
I found Rainbow Dash :3
that thing applebloom got when she tried to get a cutie pox from a potion Malavolent
You crazy, Om.
-pushes Meanwhile- Bother!
:$
Ninjazz: but I wont pay more than 10
I am Meanwhile, the potions master.
alexxm: Oh yeah, that disease.
alexxm: How are these two things connected then?
Om: How come? :S
brb
Meanwhile : Lets have a beach party! IN LONDON!
Meanwhile, at the potion masters. Are heroes-
There are no beaches in London.
Ninjazz: I'm broke xD
Plus, I hate London.
Everything is too large. And grey. And fast. And not green.
Yes, green is good.
my story of blanks theory: long log time ago ponie without cutie mark at an mature age were considered as useless so they got banished they created a town and killed everypony that had a cutie mark (u know the ornge pony that is good at finding things) the town then turned into a ghost town tormenting everypony that found it :)
o_o
Okay....
Dat wall of theory.
Om : Greed is good.
pyrocatboy: Greed is fake.
cachi01|FFXIII-2: I've read what the story of the game should be. I can PM it to you, if you want.
Om : So greed is cake.
Malavolent: sure :)
pyrocatboy: only if a psycopathic robot promises it to you.
still playing diablo 3?
FUUUUU ATLAS IS REALLY PISSING ME OFF
alexxm: Cutie Pox isn't contagious, is it?
Malavolent: Don't think so.
hmm its 230 am here should i go to sleep
Follow the butterflys. Follow the butterflys. Whee! la-la-la
Malavolent: Bet it tastes delicous.
yeah Alicorn, do so.
we don't know if it is or not and conserding the town didn't seem to know what a cutie mark was Malavolent they wouldn't either
Wait, where do you live alicorn? It's 12:30 PM here! :s
In China or something? :p
alexxm: Yeah, that makes sense.
There should be a fanfic about this.
Story of the Blanks? :S
/me drinks expired gorilla milk.
Yep
I was under the assumption that it ALREADY was a fanfic. :S
It is?
eww pyrocatboy
I don't know... I only heard about it after we just got changelings canon. They tried to make similarities and stuff... :S
I see things have cooled down.
I think Story of the Blanks is originally part of the halloween creepypasta stuff.
12SO HAPPY
/me glomps Ninjazz.
Hey Hey Bronystate!
12I found Tales of the Abyss for 3DS!
hey N4X
Oof.

Hey GilDash.

Meanwhile: I actually like the Story of the Blanks.
I got on EQD!
DitzyHooves: what news?
So do I.
Ninjazz: How ya feeling? :)
DitzyHooves: is sethisto dead?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane : What? It does a wonder for me bowels.
GilDash: ahh, your back. enjoy your meal?
Las Pegasus confirmation
GilDash: Terrible.
Wow
Sylandest: Delicious. ;)
Sylandest: you're&
*
Ninjazz: Aww, what's wrong? :(
GilDash: hehehe
lol pyrocatboy
Oh, wow, male/male shipping fanfic on EqD.
DitzyHooves: where? I dont see it.
GilDash: I got back from the graduation ceremony a couple of hours ago...
hey N4X hows your day been
Ninjazz: And...
how was the cermony Ninjazz
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/05/las-pegasus-truth-comes-out.html
Wow, the stream is completely dead
MadSurge: refresh.
Las Pegasus is apparently confirmed as Las Vegas
Ninjazz: How did that go...
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
Great so far,and tomorrow is going to be even better : Getting a 500€(yes euro) check and camping with my buddies,gonna be SO AWESOME!:D
THEY MUST PAY THE REEEEEENT
I am Ditzianne Doo.
ah.
I was the one that asked MA Larson the question
05MadSurge: klicked play?
Airpuff|Drawing: I hear you've been causing trouble. :|
lol
Wrek: all I get is "We are doing maintenance, will be back soon"
05on limeV?
so now we know we need to ponify Los Angeles
On LimeV
but I forgot my manners once again : Hows your been so far alexxm ?
GilDash: if thats what you call it.. lol I call it a halfassed argumentation -.-
/me turns the lights out.
GilDash: dont start it again
good N4X
How bout Los Appleles?
thats a great thing to hear alexxm
GilDash: please, dont kick this up again...
GilDash: Well... We sung... Waited... Then when she gave her speech and stuff we were already kinda... emotional. Then she started doing names, you know? Then she named me and one particular quote just made my ears water cause I already was feeling so crappy. Once a brother always a brother... I just kinda... didn't have words for a while.
I CANT Seeee!
Airpuff|Drawing, Alicorn_Prince_Shane: It's a really easy system. Obey the mods. There is no argument. :)
Om: open your EYES!
GilDash: there was a fuss earlier, but its blown over
GilDash: cough ok'
and See!
Ninjazz: What's wrong with that? :S
WallDives: ...Oh wow! Thanks!
I'm a poor colt, I get no sympathy
/me hugs DitzyHooves
DitzyHooves: you do, and thank you.
GilDash: It kind of hit me in a soft part... :S
Ohhh
Om: Yeah, you're *real* slow today. :D
GilDash: I understand that you have to obey the mods, which i did, but i have no intention of... nevermind. I wont take it here.
Ninjazz: Everything hits you in a soft part. ;)
I do commissions if anypony wants any
GilDash: Don't have to point it out again :(
/me hugs Ninjazz.
Ninjazz: has a soft spot NOOOOOOO
Airpuff|Drawing: PM me if it's that important.
The soft spot. If you know what I mean.
message me if you want a link to the place to ask for commissions
/me appreciates DityHooves
Meanwhile: u mustache doesnt count
ur*
Dat GilDash
guize how do I perform the song of time?
Your*
WEll DitzyHooves I would be quite interested actually
GilDash: Depends whatcha think of important, but your "follow the mods" policy makes me thinks its otherwise =P
Meanwhile: DILIGAF
Yeah you kinda do.
Airpuff|Drawing: It's the simplest solution. And the technically correct one.
GilDash: I guess. but all rules and communities must have room for change. Just not all who understand that -.-
get me when this is over...agian.
again^
GilDash: I'm just saying that this entire year I just didn't do what I should have done.
WallDives: Will do!
If i remember ._.
Ninjazz: Eight years baby. At least you know now. :D
ALL the whirlwind mobs!
Ninjazz: Huray for insight! albeit late...
Om WallDives no reason to be rude.
GilDash: I guess so... :S
Ninjazz: You'll be fine. :)
Airpuff|Drawing: Don't interperate it as rude. :)
interpret*
Airpuff|Drawing: I'm not being rude. I just dont care for rule arguments. I deal enough with that IRL.
Thank you!
GilDash: you and me will have to look after him for a time
:<
never mind can't do it
if it comes off as rude, sorry you're offended.
WallDives: well dont coem and join the discussion at all and start a personal assault on me then.
Sylandest1: I look after *everypony.* ;)
/me hugs Ninjazz.
WallDives: And yes, you did assault me personally.
GilDash: don't I know it...hehe :$
WallDives: Get back in your box its not over yet!
Airpuff|Drawing: dont know how, but whatever, sorry.
Thank you...
:S I just hope we'll switch back to the other stream client soon, because LimeV is completely dead to me...
WallDives: No problem.
Oh lawl at EQD
Airpuff|Drawing: Can I insult you again? If thats alright.
Sylandest1: Oh, I think you've yet to find out exactly how comforting I can be. ;)
i do stuff like OC chubbies ($10), oc pony ($15), pony fashion($15), ponified song lyrics ($10)...
Om: What?
i'll be back later gonna get some groceries
ponified song lyrics?
Airpuff|Drawing: I'm saking if I can insult you as to not be rude. Cuse you are so sensative.
GilDash: meep!
I always wondered: Derpys "real name" is Dity doo,and she's a pegasus...And if,(!)IF(!) Daring doo wasn't just a ponytale...are they somehow related?
Om: ~Chocolate sauce!~
Om: Why do you want to insult me?
Derpy's real name is Derpy nowadays N4X.
Airpuff|Drawing: Can I?
I have a better headcanon that fixes that problem, wanna hear it?
Om: Sure go ahead, but its at own risk
Om: ~Lots of chocolate sauce!~
No/
Airpuff|Drawing: I don't like your ideas, RP if you want but you will take the consiquencess. What you drawing?
GilDash: DISREGARD CHOCOLATE AQUIRE ALLCAPS!
Cutecenaras are renaming ceremonies
Om: ~CHOCOLATE SAUCE THEN!~
Om: Thats not an insult, you are simply giving your opinion of Rp.
...... :P
Om: and im drawing Lyra
Streaming?
Airpuff|Drawing: Fun~
xd
Well Meanwhile : In Winter Wrap up she was mentioned as Ditzy,so I guess "Derpy" is just some kind of Nickname.Because cmon! Derpy? I love the name but given by the parents?!
at a cutecenara a pony can choose to pick a new name, most pick one related to their cutie mark
Om: Yep :P
which is why so many have names related to their cutie marks.
Airpuff|Drawing: What's Lyra doing? ;)
N4X: No confirmation on whether or not the referred to "Ditzy Doo" was actually Derpy though.
GilDash: Empty threats.
GilDash: Smiling shyly x)
/me hovers chocolate sauce over Om.
Om: Oh really? ;)
GilDash: Yes.
Airpuff|Drawing: Why, have I just hit on her? :D
She used to go by one name and at her Cutecenara she changed it to the other. But ponies still sometimes call her by her old name
GilDash: Nope xD
/me drops chocolate sauce on Om.
Om: Told ya. ;)
DitzyHooves: decent, however it does not explain why the ponies that are shown before they get their cutiemark already have their name (aka twilight sparkle, pinkie pie, RD... etc etc
Airpuff|Drawing: Yeah, it'd be terrified smile otherwise. :D
No confirmation except "that clearly was her name and anyone saying otherwise is creating an illusory world for themselves", that is.
GilDash: That's nice. I'm glad you had so much fun.
Om: You're covered in chocolate sauce....
ahahaha GilDash xD
GilDash: That I am.
Om: You look delicious...
CK|Ded: Yeah that sounds real compelling.
If it weren't so very clearly denying logic I might even like that idea, but yeah.
GilDash: That I do.
Om: I've yet to have a dessert...
/me rolls around in the dirt and makes me gusta face
Also, unless I'm mistaken, which is quite possible, I do believe ditzy doo hasn't been actually adressed to being the one we call derpy, it was just assumed. There is no mention in the show that actually attaches the name to the face
Meanwhile: It's somewhat more compelling than pretending they're different ponies with absolutely no form of evidence beyond the willing suspension of disbelief.
the writer confirmed that she IS the same pony
Om: ... You really think that's going to stop me. I've eaten worse. ;)
CK|Ded: That and the fact that Derpy is referred to as "Derpy" on screen.
Meanwhile : When "The Last Roundup" was censored: We got a decleration of one of the creaters (Don't know which right now) and It refers to "Ditzy" was changed to "Derpy" by order from one of the producers I think. Also in Winter Wrap up : Only Derpy would fly north instead of south 2 years in a row...or would anypony else?
CK|Ded: Who's the one with the suspension of disbelief here exactly
DitzyHooves: it is, and we know it, however in the show it hasn't been mentioned once
GilDash: What? That was for pleasure value! ALLCAPS!
Meanwhile: Still you.
so in fact, following show logics, ditzy doo can be a completly different pony
/me noms Om's chocolate covered body.
Ditzy Doo was mentioned first. -during winter wrap up
she was mentioned
dinky?
Mentioned, never IDd.
however no face was attached to the name, not show wise atleast
GilDash: Say that ten times fast.
it didn't show her tho
Om: Too busy licking right now. ;)
actually from show canon, dinky probably isn't derpy's daughter
GilDash: Doooo eeeeet
No, not really. XD There is zero evidence in the show that they are different ponies except this comical asspull of "well you don't see them both in the same frame at the same time so obviously they're different"
she's more likely carrot top's
CK|Ded: That same logic beats your argument.
Om: When you're all nice and clean maybe.
It's a fan theory that has zero weight behind it.
what's a fan theory?
GilDash: Fine. Hury it up then, we have toung twisters to say!
that Dinky is Derpy's daughter?
There's zero evidence that they're the same pony besides "Well Ditzy Doo is apprently a bit dense, and so is Derpy, therefore Ditzy = Deryp"
Maybe
The plan was that the crosseyed pony we all know and love was going to be named ditzy
Well it's kind of a fan thing too
However, from purely watching the show, there is not a single piece of evidence that Ditzy = derpy
how bout we just call her Derpy Ditzianne Doo
Meanwhile: Except for the writers kind of admitting that they changed the name. :p
Om: Oh, I've got some far more interesting things to twist my tongue around. ;)
Meanwhile : The Evidence they are the same is : The Name was changed from Ditzy to derpy in TLR !
CK|Ded: So they changed the name, meaning that Derpy isn't Ditzy.
she marries the DOCTOR thus her last name becomes Hooves, thus Derpy Hooves
GilDash: Thats just creepy.
Om: Creepy for some, kinky for others. ;)
you're not getting the point I'm trying to adress
SO Ditzy=Derpy...I think
Meanwhile: That's a fantastic fantasy you live in.
from writers point of view, they were the same pony
But...?
ditzy = derpy
GilDash: Okay. Compromise then. You are creepy.
however, from show point of view, they never have shown the cross eyed pony to be ditzy
there were going inital gonna call her Ditzy
Om: That's not a compromise. ;)
they were
another thing about the cutecenara naming ceremony is Diamond Tiara
What you are attemoting to establish is that Ditzy and Derpy are both one pony, but apparently they aren't. Because canonically a Ditzy Doo and a Derpy have both been established, ergo, they aren't the same individual.
They're clearly the exact same pony. It would make a lot more sense to claim "Derpy" is a nickname for Ditzy, given show context.
Does anyone know anything for a sour stomach? :S
shouldn't her name be Diamond Rich?
Anything good I meant.
GilDash: Its not? I have been lied to. I blame Ninjazz
There is no end to the skydive through clouds in LOZ: Skyward Sword, it's like the world is made of clouds :3
Ninjazz: Alkalines. :)
Om: :(
im back
CK|Ded: unlikely, if they called her derpy they would have done so in the winter wrap up episode too
GilDash: Can we use kitchen names? :$
for being a nice person
Om: You should be taking your lessons from me, not him. ;)
not completly impossible, ofcourse
Ninjazz: Base. :D
Blowdown: Except now you're mixing IC and OOC contextx.
Ninjazz: Chalk?
*Contexts
I'm gonna say her name before she renamed it at her cutcenara was Spoilt Rich and changed it to Diamond Tiara
GilDash: Not helping! :D
What you are attemoting to establish is that Ditzy and Derpy are both one pony, but apparently they aren't. Because canonically a Ditzy Doo and a Derpy have both been established, ergo, they aren't the same individual.
GilDash: Jealous?
DitzyHooves: then Shining Armor's name should be Shining Sparkle
I'm taking it literal here, IC Ditzy is not derpy, period
ooc clearly ditzy is derpy
Ninjazz: How about some bicarbonate of soda?
GilDash: i walk away for two minutes and i come back to this. What did you do?
no, at the cutecenara, they can change their names
Om: Me? How the hay could I get jealous with all my numbers? ;)
If we all agree from show point of view that ditzy magically changed name, that's just silly and working around the point
Sylandest1: I dont know what the hell happened.
Sylandest1: Interacted. :)
But the Hay what is up with the Bubbles after all?!
Um, no, the two aren't completely different answers. If, OOC, the writers say "they are the same", that doesn't mean that IC they aren't. In fact it means the exact opposite.
GilDash: I dunno? Why don't you explain how?
It's not impossible, just highly improbable
GilDash: so thats what you call it, lol
Cutecenara renaming ceremony is a reasonable conclusion
Blowdown: What does "derpy" even mean in proper english? Clearly Ditzy/Derpy is not "derpy" :D
Om: I just said I don't know. I think it's an impossibility. :D
CK|Ded: Wrong. Anything on the drawing board cannot be set as canon until implemented as such.
http://derpy.me/lPSe6
MadSurge: derpy is not proper english, as far as I know
its like getting a new name when a person becomes an adult.
Sylandest1: It's a form of interaction unique to me. ;)
they do that in some cultures
GilDash: Improbability, havent you seen Hitchickers?
and I don't feel like I'm getting my point across
alrighty, everypony, I'm stepping out to get some exersise. I'll be back in an hour or so. Ya'll be good now! GilDash, behave while I'm gone
oh well, it doesn't matter
Canon says a Ditzy Doo and a Derpy exist, therefore, two ponies.
Meanwhile: I'm pretty sure the writers of the show know better than a few of the show's fans what the reality of the world is.
bye Sylandest1.
Om: You have an infinite imporbabilty drive? :O
Grr Bronysith thats the 4th pirate today xD
Cya Sylandest1.
CK|Ded:
GilDash: I am one!
Derp is a neologism that was established by several movies,shows such as Southpark
Stupid enter key.
WallDives|Unlikable: oh, by the way walldives, you're not unlikeable. I like you :)
Sylandest1: Can't promise anything. ;)
CK|Ded: we understand what you're trying to say
Blowdown: exactly, so the claims of her being offensive are dumb :D
Meanwhile : Canon says? Can I read that somewhere?
/me hugs Ninjazz, GilDash, and WallDives|Unlikable
Oi, WallDives|Unlikable. That tag is a lie.
"At birth, a samurai was given a name by which he would be known until his coming of age ceremony."
Om: If infinite imporbability... and it's improbable you and me... ;)
Ninjazz: would u like to see my oc
/me hugs Sylandest1.
MadSurge: spongebob squarepants is a good example why the claims are dumb
Sure, Bronysith.
GilDash: Aye.
N4X: If you watch winter wrap up, we have a named Ditzy Doo. And the legendary overshadowed Applejack episode names Derpy. Two names, two ponies.
Blowdown: Apparently not, if you're still insisting that reality isn't reality. If the writers say this is how it is and are not lying (and there's no reason to assume they are), that's Word of God and trumps IC canon.
pinie pie is staring at me though the tv
the tag is moreso for the mail I receive on a near-daily basis.
Om: So, you could speed things up between us. ;)
GilDash: Nope.
CK|Ded: listen, I understand what you're trying to say and I believe you're wrong
Are we talking about Derpy Hooves again?
CK|Ded: however, we both aren't able to convince the other, and we both believe we are right
Blowdown: yep, everyone in that show is dumb as a brick and they're not considered "offensive"
'Fraid so Kandarihu.
Meanwhile : Never thought that "Derpy" could be a Nickname for Ditzy? Because shes just so...clumsy
CK|Ded: this discussion is therefor tedious and not usefull, so lets stop it
GilDash: It only workds when i have no idea what I am doing.
N4X: There's no reason to assume that's the case. That's an entirely fanon interpretation.
CK|Ded: lets just believe whatever we like to believe and enjoy the show
Alicorn_Prince_Shane bring me your finest wenches
Om: I'm pretty sure I can take you to that state. ;)
not to mention she's also cute and cuddly :P
GilDash: Not when i am on a drawing high.
Lol ditzy is Derpy..
No arguing that
Meanwhile : I totally don't want to argue but you have a kind of Black/White view on this
and I do feel that should go for the rest of you too, N4X / Meanwhile and some other people that were argueing about it.
Blowdown: Derpy is still Derpy to the fandom anyway, and Ditzy Doo isn't that bad of an "official" name :D
Airpuff: Apparently there is. >_>
/me gives DeathStar to alexxm
Om: You're actually in a good mood...? :O
Hey alexxm :) how was the report on bronies?
Fanon has absolutely no bearing on canon material, and it never will.
what do you guys think of that headcanon?
GilDash: Weird, I know!
MadSurge: I don't dislike ditzy, it's a fine name
Well, the whole franchise of Squarepants runs on nonsense. Derpy Hooves is popularly characterized as a dimwitted klutz. But I do understand how this can be offensive to those sensitive to the mentally disabled.
it fits nicely
/me hugs Om. :)
I think Om took my good mood.
I am not an idiot
alexxm: hi
WallDives: Would you like some good mood? ;)
WallDives: Did you want it back?
Well Blowdown : I guess you are right,but I think it's enjoyable to talk about Ponies on a Brony chat....isn't it?
Blowdown: hear hear.
hey DeathStar hows your day been
MadSurge: Well.. Why dont you just call Ditzy Doo, Derpy then? =S I mean.. It is the same pony. Whatever you call her she is the same pony..
What they hay?
I just act silly to cheer up other ponies, I thought everypony knew that
Om: considering how horrible things go when i'm in a good mood, its probably better I dont.
/me hugs GilDash "you only get this one:
alexxm: ok
Om: ... :O
...
No freakin
Kandarihu: fair enough, however basing a whole franchise off of retarded people(not my choice of words, I'm aiming at your "soccermoms") still is a lot worse than derpy
way
Om is cracking. lawl.
if somepony gets a sad letter, I cheer them up by acting silly
Om: Are you okay? Feeling ill? Do you need to lie down? :O
I know DitzyHooves ...I know It's just unfair :(
GilDash: IM INVINCIBLE!
Airpuff: but I do call her both Derpy and Ditzy, she's still an adorable clumsy pony :D
hey
hi Kaworu.
lolz
N4X: I agree I enjoy discussing ponies, but this discussion is going nowhere
Om... actually hugged... me... *squee*
i was scared before
According to Faust the name has apparently settled on Derpy Hooves, which in terms of canon material would make Ditzy Doo a different pony.
and that's a shame
Yeah, Blowdown. Derpy > Spongebob.
Hello Kaworu
i was banned from the server
Kaworu: Naughty boy. ;)
Ninjazz: Boo!
why Kaworu
Argh!
Crackle's a guy right?
why you do this, Om?
the usual things...
the banned ip
he's kinda cute
Blowdown: Wait a minute
crackle's a... uumh
Ninjazz: Cuse.
something!
to prevent abuse
Ninjazz: If you're feeling jealous... ;)
/me hugs GilDash
and protect the server
Meanwhile: No, that is misinterpretation of the writer's intentions just to satisfy the ridiculous notion that they are two identical-in-appearance ponies. >_>
/me hugs alexxm.
n4x a whole minute? gee you're demanding:D
Om: The worst kind of reason... :|
but if you ship me with Hayseed turnip truck, you are going to pay
Ninjazz: Aint it tho?
but i took out internet key and replugged it...ANOTHER IP
Kandarihu: dimwitted klutz = sound pretty much like Snails for me;)
i trolled the dns blacklist
CK|Ded: Meanwhile please guys, let's stop this useless discussion:)
GilDash: Yes, dammit. I feel like crap and my damn stomach is making me feel worse.
/me holds Ninjazz and kisses his cheek.
Om: Yes. It is.
let's just all believe what we like to believe, and ENJOY PONIES
CK|Ded: Ditzy Doo was a moniker that may have been Derpy's name at one point, but that is no longer the case. She has been given a name and what may have been is irrelevant.
GilDash: Are you laying down? Try drinking somethin
Ninjazz: There, there... :(
>///o
If the writer has said that the character formerly known as Ditzy is now Derpy, the correct interpretation of this statement is "same pony". You're free to keep believing something else, but that is not how the writers said it.
GilDash: Lol that was for Ninjazz
*to me
Om: I'd much rather you just lie on top of me. ;)
Regardless, it's an incredibly dumb thing to argue about.
Om: No. Just sitting on my damn wheel chair stool.
CK|Ded Thank you !
GilDash: Hmm, sounds like a sugjestion. Sooooo NO!
guys, stop textwalling with no new relevant information
CK|Ded: Which is the words of someone who knows he's lost but is determined to be stubborn about it.
you're just repeating yourself now
see u later guys sry
i was happy
Om: I was telling, not asking. ;)
Ninjazz: Lay down and get sum soda!
Om: I has no soda. :(
GilDash: No you werent.
Ninjazz: Go get some!
Meanwhile: Now you're just trolling. But I'm not five years old so I'm not going to bite. Sorry to disappoint you.
Blowdown: wat?
Om: It's 3:06 in the morning! :(
CK|Ded: You mean you weren't trolling me with literally everything you said?
CK|Ded: Ditzy = Derpy Is all i say :)
ok, this chat doesn't like me, I'm blowdown and my name is already in use
Ninjazz: Aw, go to fucking sleep already. :D
eep. friendship problem. i wish twilight were here. this is her specialty >.<
Ninjazz: I see no problem.
Ninjazz: /)
hi guys im back.....so why is Meanwhile and CK|Ded fighting?
Om: Want to test that theory. ;)
GilDash: I just took a nap. :$
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: (\
Ninjazz: u live in aus?
Ninjazz: It's 3 in the morning. GO TO SLEEP!
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Close to it.
Fighting? Nonono, I was explaining, Meanwhile is fighting. So now I'm just not responding. :p
hey cachi01 what have you been up to
miconesia?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Eyup.
just for reference, I'm the same guy that told you to stop argueing, not some random new dood
Also why are two ponies apparently making out in the middle of chat
?
GilDash: I just did the results were, your moma so fat she needs a swiming pool to wash her socks
alexxm: hi! umm nothing lately lol
I'm not fighting, I'm explaining 'accurately with actual information'
CK|Ded: lol wut
GilDash: I don't feel sleepy, so, no. :P
you were both argueing, and long overdue too
Om: Good job I fell far from the tree then. ;)
let's drop the issue and discuss applejack, which is clearly best pony
GilDash: Science is power!
Ninjazz: I'd like you to go to bed anyway. ;)
pipsqueakthepirate: there is no overdue* to a discussion xDD
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
pfft accurate is a exxageration
PINKIE PIE IS BEST PONY
Ninjazz: Dooo et.
Airpuff|Drawing: yes, there is
GilDash: Then I'd miss all the fun... :(
I distinctly recall seeing people talking about making out "things" during that whole discussion. :|
Meanwhile bring me your finest wenches
:o <---- u cant argue with her
Airpuff|Drawing: the point where people are not bringing new arguements to a discussion is where the discussion is overdue
pipspeakthepirate: Nonsense, it takes two to argue.
pipsqueakthepirate: It is when the arguments start getting pointless. I agree then. But not any clear line
Ninjazz: Tsk, that's where the real fun begins, silly. ;)
Om: Science... you're starting to sound like pony_zen now... ;)
I apologise CK|Ded I got rather gung ho in that and it was uncharacteristically unpleasant of me.
Airpuff|Drawing: the arguements were pointless for quite some time already, whatever the line is, they crossed it big time
GilDash: Who?
pipsqueakthepirate: ah they've reached that point. Then i agree xD
pipspeakthepirate: And reiteration of a point not being listened to is not an argument, it's reiteration. An argument would require going further than that.
Om: Another number of mine. ;)
Okay guys sorry for starting this fluff...how did we even got here I...I just don't know what went wrong
Om: I've met him.
GilDash: Ohhh, what color is he.
GilDash: Or she
Om: Actually, that's a lie. Not a number. A *name.*
GilDash: or it liek you
CK|Ded: I already told you, I see what you're trying to say, and I do believe so does meanwhile
/me kisses om.
I get into plenty of arguments so I know the difference. :P
See?
Ponies making out in chat.
I wasn't just imagining that.
I apologise CK|Ded I got rather gung ho in that and it was uncharacteristically unpleasant of me.
GilDash: You forgot to capitalize the O making it a proper noun
im still dumb founded by VioletGreySha s drawing
/me magically swaps everypony in chat's genders
/me kisses Om more for corrections.
dafuq DitzyHooves
lol
what is this disscussion about? O_o
uh
apparently about genderswap!
Ditzy and sex
cachi01: stuff
:D
GilDash: You forgot to square the root sum of the O
What the?!
thanks for the boobs DitzyHooves
Ninjazz: I'll have some of that last one, please. ;)
cachi01: wether or not dizty is derpy.. or something..
How did we got there Ninjazz?
everyone who hasn't yet, read "two peas in a pod"
Anyways, need to take off. That discussion sorta threw me off-track and I wanted to get some stuff done today. >.<
Airpuff|Drawing: oooh ok lol
GilDash: He said and. Why chose?
in one universe Ditzy is Jenny, the doctor's daughter
Om: I wonder what you'd taste like with marshmellows in your ears...
Seeya CK|Ded.
lol DitzyHooves xD
GilDash: seriously, wut?
in another she IS the doctor
2 peas in a pod is getting loads ofm popularity
12D: ?
cya CK|Ded
cachi01: srsly?
1. We never will find her true name
N4X: Well, one half the chat was arguing about Ditzy being Derpy while another part was just playing around like frisky ponies... Other than that I have no idea. :S
GilDash: That is what my friends on my skype group think I taste like ._.
pipsqueakthepirate: What? :D
Om: We sure do! XD
Om: What, marshmellow?
the "doctor" is in fact her companion
GilDash: Aye.

/me swaps her position with Meanwhile.

Meanwhile: No, you. :p

Anyhoo, I need to go mow the lawn. Back whenever.

and wrote books about her adventures
