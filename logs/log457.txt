whats this?
Dungeon Defenders
hello :)
Actually, I've never heard of the movie until it was announced about 1 or 2 weeks ago
I just know that it was preemptively cancelled
G3 episodes?
xD
seems legit
we could show G1 episodes
night
-

dont know about you people, but I honestly like G1 G2 and G3
I don't mind them
I mean, sure the earlier gens can get a little grating for me, but still
dont mind them either, which makes it fun for me when others cant stand them
Oh yeah, that too xD
i like G1 and G2
I haven't seen much of either
Just G3 and G4
G3 is bareable
shit like that is just immature
In a slightly joking way
I like being immature
Dungeon defenders
:P
being immature can be fun sometimes
it can also get the shit slapped out of you
I like having fun sensibly :3
lol
*neighbour's

I've seen it done in movies
I've seen it done in the Simpsons

If you encourage a minor to drink alcohol, that might be an issue.

kefka
KEFKA is best villain
I don't really like JRPG's.

not PSO, although I owned that.
oh
yo
In soviet russia, world destroys kefka

and darth vader's pretty cool
also, Phantasy Star predates FF.

Excessive being anything more than hugs generally.
And you've been more than excessive.

Just use some discretion, if you guys want to RP, you can do it elsewhere
lol
Do you not see dari's message up there? ^
05close battle
05hate those wasps
I call leeroy jenkins on this situation
and screw up.
05dispeys herkules
eg just b4
If you guys want to RP, why not take it to another channel, and not risk annoying mods and other members in here?
i say its up to the streamer
Or I would.
Perhaps for the sake of these kinds of exchange that rule should be expanded upon.
Then we won't have any repeat offenses.
We do, but you don't seem to be taking heed of it.
The mods don't have to give anything.
tbh some people dont understand theres 2 kinds of RP first theres in for shitz and gigglez and theres the srs nonsense
If you want to RP, do it elsewhere.
That's a warning.
According to whom.
They'll warn you out of courtesy
05each and everytime someone RPs in here, i tell them to stop. they stop for 1-5 minutes and then they are back to doign it again
05over and over
05so its tehir own fault
05Alicorn_Prince_Shane. there is a difference between arguign and discussing
actually.. yea you do
ive learnt the hard way
why is everypony arguing?
leave me out of this
well
i dont want to piss the mods off
ded
ded
LAZERS!
as soon as you break a rule, the mods are in their right to punish you for that, however immediatly banning for a minor offense isn't something a mod can just do... if they did they probably won't be mods for long
oh
Seconded.
gonna have to agree with him there, you're argueing for the sake of argueing, not a good thing
anyway...

No/
Cutecenaras are renaming ceremonies
...... :P
Streaming?
xd
She used to go by one name and at her Cutecenara she changed it to the other. But ponies still sometimes call her by her old name
No confirmation except "that clearly was her name and anyone saying otherwise is creating an illusory world for themselves", that is.
/me rolls around in the dirt and makes me gusta face
the writer confirmed that she IS the same pony
/me noms Om's chocolate covered body.
she was mentioned
Mentioned, never IDd.
however no face was attached to the name, not show wise atleast
it didn't show her tho
Maybe
how bout we just call her Derpy Ditzianne Doo
you're not getting the point I'm trying to adress
from writers point of view, they were the same pony
But...?
they were
Anything good I meant.
There is no end to the skydive through clouds in LOZ: Skyward Sword, it's like the world is made of clouds :3
for being a nice person
not completly impossible, ofcourse
