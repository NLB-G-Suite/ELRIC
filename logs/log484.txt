Om: well, if you ever feel the urge to sit down and read a good mystery, I recommend those three. Some of the biggest influences on my writing from those three
Shizuka....your comp really doesnt like runing ANYTHING
Shizuka Reminds me of when you stream.
An interesting fun fact from my liner notes. When this first premiered, they wanted to keep it a surprise that Hikaru would be piloting a Valkyrie, so they produced a special opening that omitted any sight of him in the cockpit.

03god, I should be sleeping but I gotta wait for laundry
03I have to go to a job interview in the morning :/

Gamer_Luna: me to

03I dunno if I mentioned to you how my current college works
033 months of school, 3 months of a job, repeat

I got it now... there was no space between png and guess
LOL
head rolls off
03and the last job I had, as much as it was fun, the company was kinda struggling so they can't really afford to have me back :/
just looked so wrong
The sound effects were redone around 2006.
Shamroc okay no more talking about that

How old is this anime?
1986
early 80s
O.o
Macross originally broadcast in 1982
tests?
Seems older with the animation quality
lol
03http://imgur.com/gallery/LzTqZ <- OMG, I Must try this
It's from 1982-1983
You haven't seen anime from the 70's, then.
idiots. all of them.
Is the dub from 1986?
Dub was made in 1985-86
12That sucks DRF!! I can't remember if you told me or not
I see.
00,10show was aired in the states in 82
i loved this show

SEXISM!
oh my lord
LOL
00,10it was late 70's in japan
she said it
that was so blatant
Sumica: No, it was broadcast in 1985
sexism
lol
Ah hell....sexism
Sumica: Trust me on this
it was aired in the netherlands around 88-89
I can really tell the emotions she's express from her facial expressions
Om: lol
03well it's kinda misleading, and I'm a bit annoyed at my school
Sumica: the original aired from 1982-1983.

arguing is his weakness? Send more women?
lol Shizu
the thing at the time was if something was aired in NA in said decade, it was aired a decade prior in Japan...
00,10but I recall seeing it on TV early then that.
03last semester they were like "yeah, you don't need to go back to a company if you don't like it, as long as you do the one term there"
Shizuka: :D
03well they want everybody to stay at the same company for all 4 years
Shizuka: LOL
Midnight_Tempest: This one didn't have a huge lag.
totally Shiz. I have been thinking that ever since I heard the FIRST announcement of the Wii U
except transfromers
Hi cuno :3
Just keep bickering, and the alieans will fall
lol
03so when I told the company it was just a one time thing, the co-op managers were all "why do you want another job again?"
03so yeah, applying to any places I can
Sumica: It couldn't have broadcast in 1982, since Macross was still on Japanese TV then.
hehe, I can think of a few things
Mind if I link to the AniDB on this?
DocSane: maybe not but it was more of a joke than a true fact... though the lag could still be several years at the least
Om: seems legit
12k and hi :>

MahBoi777: I think its the best plan yet.

Yes, he has.

Well, they need to bring hardcore gamers into the fold. All the hot 3rd party titles are for the 360 and the PS3. If the Wii U isn't as well represented as the 720 and PS4, Nintendo might go the way of SEGA.
Nittany_Discord: I think its tomorrow.

pfft. They already announced that "Wii U" is the official name

Well, all of Adult Swim's cartoons are done in Flash, so is MLP FiM
Never like Matalocalypse. The only Adult Swim show left that's any good is The Venture Brothers, and that's hardly ever on.
I owuld watch MLP if it were on adult swim

What's great about this movie is these are actual helicopters flying around actual LA. No CGI
Polydunami: Personally, I have no opinion on her.

DaringPineapple: You could use vocaroo.com
00,10Oh hi Dari
I like her voith
13the NPCs are just cool with it huh
KiwiBoi777: fruit = EVIL! :O
fun fact: almost all 80s movies sponsored by tobacco companies, getting their ads into film sometimes in strange ways
Shizuka: nope... every day thing apparently

No worries, they don't like human smells
Camping is for pussies, i go out without a map or supplies and SURVIVE
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: not yet

ima remember that one for awhile
i dont think there is enough Afro...

Gaben is a true legend
from the games he's made
Gaben is a BAWS
to the fact he is one of up.
us.*
he's clustering dozens of online games into dependency on one piece of software
and if that went bye-bye
MahBoi777: It's about a huge calamity that destroys THE ENTIRE world. You play as a kid who is basically trying to fix everything and save whoever he can find.
those games are fudged
But he treats gamers with respect.
bs he does
Ninjazz|Challenge: oh, well that sounds cool
MahBoi777: Check it out sometime. It's AMAZING.

"...a new class of antihero whose ability to hack into any connected system..." << they have to handle this very carefully though
I'm excited for Halo 4 and Bioshock Infinite

secshun
...
Shame on Ubisoft for not announcing Beyond Good And Evil 2
The stream is black
Why is stream black
I can't see a thing, only sound
Now I can tell why you all are so excited for Watch Dogs... And to tell you the truth... I am too.
same
phase
stream omfgdogs.com xD
Guys, Guys, use your imagination. It looks so much better
WHY IS STREAM BLACK
04It's like a radio play
BECAUSE OUR ELECTRICITY HAS BEEN BLOCKED
EVERYPONY TAKE COVER
E3 has got more interesting things now. Dishonored. The new game by Quantic Dream, Beyond: Two Souls. The Last Of Us. - and at last they announced fucking Zeno Clash 2!!!
Even the gunplay seemed cool. It had just the right amount of cinematicism with out being... over the top.
And those abilities...
I have no idea what any of those games are lambo
I'm ashamed
Well this sucks
Is the video supposed to be black?
Straisin: D: Wha-
The soundtrack makes it sound like its awesome, wish we could see it :(
wadda
All that in what basically looks like Grand Theft Auto but more in depth and character like.
I will go get sum wadda
With abilities.
Wow, Watch Dogs is like Park Chan Wook meets GTA
Or Johnny To, rather
gnight everyone take care
you too
/me hugs MahBoi777
/me grapes mahboi
Watch Dogs is definately a game to watch.
/me hugs Ninjazz|Challenge and Straisin
Ninjazz|Challenge: get back to ur challenge
But back to ponies.

Ninjazz|Challenge: dont u have to watch em with in 24 hrs?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Already past 24 hrs. I'm just finishing it now because it would seem like a waste.
Ninjazz|Challenge: so u failed
lawl Ninjazz|Challenge
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Meh.
Ninjazz|Challenge: all that work for nuttin
Who said nothing?
All the points are imaginery.
Ninjazz|Challenge: lol wut did u get out of it
Nothing.
Lol
You don't get anything other than a huge head ache.
lol
But I did this cause I wanted to. :P
Okay, Watchdogs could be interesting
Indeed, Lambo.
http://tinyurl.com/84w6jtc

I havn't had any glitches here. Music sounds nice and smooth
00,02why does this channel allways go silent during my streams ?
00,02like, if i dont stream its more active on average
Phase4: needs more picture
00,02ikr
00,02sry bout that, this is just filling time until psychonauts downloads
00,02which is a problem, as thats 2 hours away
are the visuals fixed with that?
Srry, Phase4. I'm trying to get this stupid challenge done before I collapse from exhaustion.
fun levels in that game, btw
00,02broken on windows
00,02btw, there is a linux version of psychonauts :)

Hey there Resonantwaves.

Phase4: Do you have a playlist of this somewhere?
00,02nope, this is all local
00,02queued in vlc
whats vlc?
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R677MV--WI << dis song
Hello there, Gunthler|Zzz.
00,02GuntherDW, the best media player
00,02Gunthler|Zzz, tab fail XD
VLC is quite popular. I'm using Windows Media Player Classic, though.
00,02meh, vlc is better
When is Balloon Party gonna come out?
00,02i *think* its actualy possible to stream from vlc
I see no difference between either. :P
00,02might try that later
00,02Ninjazz|Challenge, try vlc
I have... I still need to find where I put that installer.
00,02it is a better player, and works on all major operating systems
00,02wait what?
Hmmm.
00,02oh, nvm. i derp read
baloon party came out :o
I also forgot it's free...
already o_O
Right? It is still free, right? :S
yes :D

XD
Where can I download, Resonantwaves?
Oh hey, my episode ended.
they give 2 ways to download :p from the bandcamp :D ill see if i can find the link
04HAH, my hunch was right
And that concludes the team's attempt at a crack pairing. I don't see why everyone hates it so much, I liked it! The song was nice too, in fact it's one of the only songs that I can sing perfectly lyric for lyric. Off to... A Friend In Deed. Inb4 Smile Smile Smile
And what would that be, Ghosties?
04They did change Ellie's look in The Last of Us once the team for Beyond got Ellen Page to voice and model the leade character
04*lead
Huh.
/me goes to google

How long should 511MB take to download?
DuskStarshimmer: yesh filly

Phase4, unless you know some way to speed up electrons
02wb
It says it's gonna take about an hour to download 511MB, that doesn't seem right...

Rarity.
No...
Rainbow Dash
Twi is...
/me sighs
Rarity is my favorite though. :|
ehm: Doesn't matter over here. It's always cloudy anyway.
Ninjazz|Challenge: *scrolling through tabs on safari* o_o
Ninjazz|Challenge: to me Rarity looks more like a picky bitch though
You know what I'm talking about :D
Twi is best pony =3

Rarity is the best pony for she is the most generous
And looks great in socks
Wait who doesent
gilda
/me hides
ehm: Also, I never get up before sunrise.

Ghosties: Yes?

I don't even know what that is.
Kammerjunk: As do i. Its just a Little strong at the moment...
/me eats Invi
Ghosties: What I've seen so far, it's like I am alive, just with duo core gameplay
I should do that
04As in, I agree with you Vordox
Oh, FA, forgot I had an account there
Maybe Ishould actually post stuff there, but that'd turn it into my dA account

Because that's the reason I moved away from the original one, I am soo tempted to switch back
Drake
Ghosties: Tomb Raider looks immmersive, as for Last of us = Liking the new mechanics, NOT TO MENTION THE Inventory <3
Salve, Shimmer.
12blah
/me hugs Airpuff and Alicorn_Prince_Shane

12Omg I SOOOOO nearly said EW IPOD just then D:
LOL!
Ghosties: And her voice, from the hear of it
LOL
Ghosties: She sounds like a old woman :P
12Im sorry, I do it IRL all the time because of DRF
I'd use something better but >funds
/me licks Vordox
Woc: ....Are you Nittany? :P
No, i am Woc
He's a cow.

I enjoyed how the moment where Ellie threw the brick got more positive crowd response than the whole microsoft conference
Im the opposite of a cow O__O
Oom.
12I dont actuallymind people using them by the way but I just love saying EWW (apple product) etc
Although the iPod dis
You can't hide from me!
I am ok with the technical difficulties as long as derpy is here
12it's addictive
!ooM
Shimmer: Yes, IT*S NOT JUST AN ESCORT ANYMORE <3

00,02oh way
We can't go any deeper than this...
12Anyone else find it weird that my old form is attacking my new one in that photo? XD
04OH YEAH, I'm still paused at the awkward toilet moment in Rapture

Ghosties: You might want to kindly scooch outa there.
Haha XD your old one might have been better :P
00,02dis is jrp's swag
Indeed.
Vordox: you shouldn't complain, sure they didn't come with anything new really but be happy they didn't ruin the good old recipe :p
:D
Fuck logic
04But that's not how it works, Ninjazz :(
00,02and now to fix d3rb's problem
Shimmer: The Good Old recipe isn't good?
/me fucks logic
Ghosties: How do you suppose you get out of that then? :S
/me feels violated
LAWL PHASE
You are late =3
Vordox: your opinion is tolerated
actually im pretty content with all this but i wont say no to more derpy
04The correct phrasing is "Ghosties, would you kindly leave that toilet?"
Fun fact: In Latin, 'ludus' means game, play, fun or entertainment. It also means school.
Ghosties, would you KINDLY leave that toilet.
?*
Thus, it can be concluded that school = fun!
LIES
unless your latin
04So much emphasis on "kindly" :P
Shimmer: The Good Old receipt was never good....GoW is EXACTLY like Nightmare Creatures, WHICH WAS RELEASED BACK IN THE 90s! For Celestia's sake
dat tf3 server spam
I just wanted to make sure you would do it. :D
Galloran: Roman.
...
The romans spoke latin.
hey Ninjazz|Challenge ....whats the challenge refer too?
boy i will cut you
Latin*
.....stupid teamspeak 3 getting all up in my brain
Cause we all know that you would do it IF I say KINDLY.
Vordox: again, your opinion :)
d3rb: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ultimate-brony-challenge.png

ehhh maybe in 2 weeks, when its the semester break
/me claps for Ninjazz|Challenge
and I don't have impending finals
good luck man
ty
Thank you, d3rb. :$
Shimmer: The only difference is AoE attacks(Which...funnily is old as feck in gaming) and QTE...."Press this to win" :P
...
Ninjazz|Challenge: I did a marathon with around 25 other guys and girls (Mostly guys) the week before S1. Took just about 10 hours.
'Twas fun.
lol
that can apply to ninjaz and dshannon that good luck thingy :)
the week before S2*
looooool
Ghosties: As a Game Designer, I am crying lightly for how the graphics has evolved. but for gameplay... ;_;
i have wasabi crackers anyone want some
just got beatdown by luna
XD
nice
Kammerjunk: I got this, chat, and 52 episodes to separate my attention to.
Vordox: ...Graphics? Evolved? Sorry, I couldn't hear you over consoles.
Ninjazz|Challenge what episode are you up to now
geting your ass kicked by ponies
Kammerjunk: MegaTexxtures, Paraphraxes, etc etc =P
like a baus
alexxm: S2 E20
:O
:[
Ninjazz|Challenge is that it's about time
Hello everypony :)
damn, nice one. all easy rom here then
Indded, alexxm. Good one.
Watching both series, however, has nothing to do with how much of a brony you are. I have other things to do. Like eat.
hey AlienEd27
hey AlienEd27 hows your day been
Hello AlienEd27.
04What's all the hub bub about series?
hi AlienEd27
Indeed, Kammerjunk. I'm just doing this cause I happen to have the time.
ohgodwhat
wow
OHSHI
SO MUCH PONIES :D
04Doing what, Ninjazz?
Ghosties: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ultimate-brony-challenge.png
your pc must be decent Phase4
My face is full of ponies but I don't mind
00,02lol
00,02d3rb, it is quite good
Shimmer, doesnt that hurt?
having ponies inside your face...
No, ponies are soft
derpy has a wingboner
I like the music
Ninjazz|Challenge: "one can watch ponies while eating/using restroom" - I have a desktop computer ._.
smartphone?
Kammerjunk: I suppose that is for lucky laptops users. :$
that handicap XD
same here Kammerjunk but you can always bring meals up and invest in a bucket
I do have a laptop, but it's an awfully old HP.

Ninjazz, i did that already
00,02those ponies lag the game too much
00,02:(
Ghosties: Playstation All Stars.
Congrats, Galloran.
Oh wow, I won the bronystate lottery again. And I wasn't even there.
huzzah derpy the resource hog!
It wasnt to hard either
Anywho, sleeptime

^dat koala Phase4
It isn't. It's just watching ponies all day.
00,02is the image ok?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :youdontsay:

You get 1000 points.
00,03Oh hai
http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm8/ThikJerseyChik/CaptObviousCat.jpg
Your pc isn't good until it can run 5xcrysis 2 games, render a 1080p movie and browse justin bieber's twitter at the same time
Phase4: DDAT KOALA
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo!
06i see you
06sittin at your desktop
00,02ikr
14hello
Ghosties: You went away D:
14o.o
04I'm back
I'm front
wb Ghosties
Where you been?
04Kitchen
Ghosties: TWo things I wish to discuss with someone, and you seem to have the correct mindset to see where things are going.
Livingroom
Not going to say anything.
Shimmer: If your PC can run Crysis 2 x5, you need to stop using NASA's work computers.
Ghosties: Let's begin, Wonderbook? Thoughts?
14m-me?
/me looks around
04Should have had the Guildmaster from Fable narrating
Oh shit
dont get me started on him
04BUT
Kammerjunk: why? It's not like they use them for anything useful
Ghosties: I meant, as a tool?
06noU
04Guildmaster is awesome
04Oh, as a product?
be that as it may
Shimmer: Oh no, not in the slightest.
his fucking voice is engraved into my mind
14xD
14how are you? :P
And that was It's About Time. Rather average episode. People say that it's a Twilight episode when Pinkie was actually the star of the show. Off to... Dragon Quest.
Vordox: Wondahbook looked like an april's fool joke... at least it turned into one with all the time they spent presenting it
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/319/253/644.gif
04Gimmicky and nobody will buy it
Ghosties Shimmer: I see good value and possibility in it
04Save for maybe a Harry Potter fan
Ghosties: Maybe not for what it was developed for but still some value that can be had.
04Gimmicks
04That's exactly what it is
Ghosties: Those Gimmicks sells. :P
Ghosties: Well, conflicting, but even I see that's some value in it, just not for what it may be now though ,bleh
04But they're degrading to a core player
Ghosties: And now, the important question: Sony All Stars. :P
04No core player is going to buy it
04Alright
04All Stars
04What do you ask?
Ghosties: Worth of it's existance? :P I say no
why no?
Sony All Stars? Sonic vs. Sonic?
04Without Crash Bandicoot it's terrible
Oh right, Crash Bandicoot was fun.
XBT FUCKING SLEEP SO i'M GOING HERE.
d3rb: Even as a gameplay, it's stale, boring and pretty much a huge watered down version of Smash
I don't even know what makes them think a Big Daddy is an Allstar.
I played the original crash games :^P
so epic http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/319/574/5fb.png
i find it funny how not many can say the same these days
04And even if Crash will be unveiled later, they should have unveiled Crash at E3
How'd I get xbt when I meant to type Can't?
http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/319/575/019.png
Ghosties: And really...All characters I saw in the previes was...Parappa...That's it.
have you played it Vordox...
04Parappa was it
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/319/577/6f3.png
04Parappa was good
06good
06:3
06you?
04But fucking Big Daddy?
14^^
d3rb: Playing and seeing has alot of things :P
04What does Big Daddy have to do with Sony -_-
yeah big daddy, wtf
Parappa was fucking Big Daddy?
00,02i used to be a heavy like you
14I'm great :3
Exactly.
Ghosties: Big...whatever.. Sly and Parappa = Mascot worthy
00,02then i took an arrow to the everything
00,02:P
04No sir, not in my book
04Crash Bandicoot
04He's the original mascot
00,02^
/me fus ro dah's Phase4
04He's the heir
00,02thats a point
00,02where is crash
^
04Crash was the original Sony mascot for the Playstation
I miss Crash
Ghosties: True, Crash almost did become Mascot of Sony
04He was
00,02and sonic for that matter
Crash was cool.
00,02you know
00,02besides ssbb
04He was considered the mascot for Playstation
Ghosties: He never was officially.
Fu Phase4 I slammed my headphones on my head when I heard the tune
crash & cortex should be in it
04But to every game around the world he was
00,02Shimmer, ^_^
00,02awww
Ghosties: Yep, true
What of N.Brio
00,02music stopped
the stream be back
Noes
Ghosties: And now, WHAT characters would be good to have in All stars to pique interest? :P
04Spyro
04And Crash
Ninjazz|Challenge: 1 does not simply fus ro dah
HELL YEAH
yep
04Don't care about any others
Spyro is legend
What Ghosties said
04Just Crash and Spyro
I say: Gex, Tomb Raider, Spyro, Crash, Nathan Drake(Why not),
04Well
04Gex
Though, i hate that they fucking put Spyro into a new game
04I would have to agree
and completely changed his look
gex i disagree
04Gex would be awesome
wasnt he on other pl;atforms?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Where was Gondor when one couldn't simply fus ro dah?
04Lara Croft...maybe
Ratchet&Clank
:^P
^
Shimmer: OH YEAH! Those
04But Lara is gonna be multi-platform, if I'm not mistake
04*mistaken
Ghosties: She did start out as a Sony
but lara started on sony
04I thought Lara started on PC?
no
started on Sony
Tomb Raider started on sony so I went wtf when they said it's gonna be xbox exclusive for starters
04Hmm, ah well
Ghosties: Also.. What about the Original Syphon Filter Guy? :P Logan
04Nope
That would be awkward... I mean look at Lara now.
Ninjazz|Challenge: everywhere
04Not recognizable
the problem is all these characters may have been on the ps1,2 or 3 but are not all owned by sony so it would be a pin in the ass to get rights for all of them
good morning people :)
CLOUD needs to be on allstars

04Oh god
144 days of school left, and I still have three test to do xD
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: One does not simply go to everywhere.
hi viri :3
Ghosties: Unless you played it I guess... What if we put in Jak and Daxter, which compliments Ratchet and Clank?
04If they get Cloud then FF fans would burst a tit if Sephiroth didn't make it in
14HML :D
YAYZ
Ninjazz|Challenge: hwere was gondor when one could not simply go everywhere
RC vs JD is one thing i want to see
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Mordor.
get tifa and cloud, ff fans will buy 3 sopies each
copies**
04Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank I also agree too
04*to
Ninjazz|Challenge: i wonder who i should wub more Invi|eaten or Airpuff
Agreed as well.
There'll be no FF characters för certain, no way SquareEnix would allow it
04But not as four separate characters, only two
06ohai derp
yup
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Why are you telling me this? :S
06i still have like, 2 weeks left :3
04Save available character slots
especially RC
06tests incoming~
being that they never really seperated
Ninjazz|Challenge: cause ur my friend
Ratchet and Clank AS one character.
So we have Parappa, Gex, R&C, Spyro, Crash, J&D...
04Vordox
04You're forgetting though
Alright then, I'll just be screwinf around tumblr. ping me when you need me
Ghosties what are you talking about
Ghosties: Who?
14aww
04Snake was in fucking SSBB
Solid Snake?
Ghosties: That's Japanese. :P
04And -_-
04So?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I know that... But why tell me?
Ghosties: Also, you know the backstory of WHY he is in it?
the game needs an r34 skyline to represent the 300 skylines on granturismo :D
It dates back to even Melee for god sake. <.<
04I've heard that Kojima pleaded with Nintendo to have him in...that's just hearsay, of course
Ghosties what game is this your talking about
Ghosties: It's..."kinda" true
04To advertise and market
04Super Smash Bros Brawl
06i love google chrome
06"you first visited this site on the 9th of June, 2015"
06:D
Can Nintendo do anything against that?
Medievil, Oddworld?
Ghosties: And once Third party came in, Smash may become a world hit once more(Which it is)
MEDIEVIL!
<4
<3 YES
14o.o
And Abe from Oddworld is kinda...err...I'm not saying he can't fight but...
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8u5/
He's kinda out of the place
04Okay okay
04I'll admit
04I defeated the Master Hand with Snake as my final character
So whp wants a hug?
04But that's only because
04Solid Snake is just far more badass than any other character in that roster
Ghosties: You know he's a Grand Top Tier. :P
00,02lol pyro song
Litwick: Do you have Flame Body?
:d
Ghosties: Brawl is good, but compared to Melee it's not. Waiting for Project M
Nope, Flash Fire.
/me gets hugged anyway
04I know I sound incredibly immature saying he's better than Mario, Donkey Kong, etc.
04Don't care
04Solid Snake
04Your argument is invalid
Snake is cool.
sweet.
Even as a Nintendo fanboy I agree.
snake > all characters....EVER
Ghosties: Hey, once Dave got into the game, F*CK logic and just have fun
Ninjazz|Challenge: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8uv/
lol, shane
Alicorn_Prince_Shane lol
Let's see...WHOELSE famous characters from Sony can we take a liking to...
ehm: /)
Pyramid Head?
o/
Vordox what about crash bandicot
04Oh lordy
Shimmer: True.. But he would kick everyone sarse :P
Already mentioned
alexxm: Already mentioned
04Pyramid Head in All Stars :D
/me attacks Alicorn_Prince_Shane with hugs
Vordox: heaps of characters they COULD use...but getting the rights
04Now that would be hilarious
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :)
d3rb: Don't care. :P
ah right Shimmer and Vordox didn't know
00,03Whre was Crash Bandicoot? >: (
i know, i want to believe it will be an awesome game
Pyramid Heads 3rd super: Brings the darkness to the whole arena
04In the mean while *goes to listen to Turtle Woods from CB2*
00,03where*
Scoot-Scootaloo: We're discussing "Fan favourites we want from Sony's good game era"
04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADVk0vDYz80
KLONOA!
04Just listen to that
what about that vampire guy from soul reaver
04Pure awesome
GOOD old Klonoa!
pony_1471: OH! Soul Reaver guy = Good bet
00,03But I liked the Bandicoot games :(
Probably a Helghast soldier too cause Sony loves its Killzone.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Everyone wants Crash in All stars =3
Vordox was onimusha ever on other consoles apart from playstation
alexxm: Yes, it jumped over to Dreamcast, then to Nintendo as well
Hia everypony!
04Crash Bandicoot 2 is on my PS3 hard drive
Cervantes from original Soul Edge
hey |Discord|
04Because Crash is just awesome
ah right thought that would have been a good choice if it didn't Vordox
what about 1 and 3?
Ghosties: I have 1, 2, 3 and CTR on my hard drive :p
hey |Discord| hows your day been
alexxm: True, would be a good addition, kinda fits the whole place.
/me hugs d3rb alexxm
Shimmer: you has ps plus dont you
alexxm: Pretty good so far
Nop
ohh ok, i got it, they were all free one month
ALUNDA!
Alunra*
BAH
[21:14:31] <~Articuno> !chatstats
[21:14:37] <~Articuno> !chatstats
[21:14:40] <~Articuno> :(
[21:14:46] <Drake> :/
[21:14:49] <Drake> usually it works
well "free", paid for ps plus
d3rb: nah I bought them all, long ago :)
[21:14:56] <Drake> wait
Ape Escape..but kind of wrong element imo
how about someone from tekken
it got broken, I'll fix it when the server comes back up
the song is calling me
Jin Kazama for sure
alexxm: Too mainstream, and that's Konami
Or Capcom whatever
Vordox as far as i'm aware tekkens only been on playstation
I would have Cervantes from Soul Edge but guess he's not famous enough :)
alexxm: It did start out heavily on that yes
Tekken 6 is on xbox too alexxm
14Articuno :D
But fine, Tekken = In then, :P
Any of Tekken, whatever, no character etc etc.
oh i didn't know that Shimmer
so many characters potentialy...please dont screw it up sony, i want it to be a great game
tekken is made by namco
Shimmer: Soul calibur(Formerly Soul Edge) started out on PSX
04Tekken 6 was terrible
not konami or capcom
I know Vordox
04But I'm a weird fighter fan, so yeah
If we REALLY bring out the guns...Resident Evil Character(Any)
Nemesis
04nah
random tyrant 001
:D the nemesis
Ghosties: Imagine Leon :P
Wubs all around.
04Meh
04I mean
06i love my email alerter sound
04I absolutely *love* Resident Evil 2
06it goes BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD!
04But we wouldn't get believable Leon
Nemesis with his killer tongue (literally)
Ghosties: He showed he can do melee stuff in 6...after all. :p
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8xa/
dat twilight
2nd best song
I came on the stream the right time :)
o.o
Woodentoaster = Epic
LOOOL! Just saw Colim McRae racing on this list.. <3 I miss you man.. I really do
seconded, YokuPony
Colin*
hey YokuPony hows your day been
this guy did much for the fandom
14xD
04I just hate how Capcom repackaged Leon
04He was so much better in RE2
04So much more believable
Ghosties: He was "in character" :p
04Had more character
04And he didn't sound boring
alexxm: Walked to my local store....in heavy rain....with the flu -.-
OH!
04Paul Haddad had an awesome voice
For All Stars = CROC!(But he was on N64 too)
12LOL
/me hugs YokuPony
04It felt very much like it could have been a thing for Leon
:)
04But now we have Paul Mercier
yeah croc wouldnt work
04And we just have to accept that...or rather I do
/me sighs
/me pats YokuPony on the back
04Yoku...why man?
/me brohooves at Ghosties to cheer him up? /)
14homeworks x.x
12SOITAL!!!!
14hi Soital :3

12Rar ~
WOW! Was Duke Nukem on PSX?!?!?! ADD HIM FFS!
Ghosties likes hugs instead. :P

Ghosties: we were low on essentials (bread, milk etc.) and I was the only one in the house at the time...
"Blow it out your arse"
Moar Toaster :)
12Wow.
sigh, i wish Vordox
....
alexxm good, but I had a Test todaym which didn't go so well, I couldn't learn yesterday because of my headache :/
hi everypony
04Man, Yoku...no car?
12I am disappointed, I just found out that Andrew has taken me off his friend list on Facebook.
/me mind controls Ghosties and makes him brohoof Shimmer
Saw that coming... :D
Hello Master-Derpy
hi Master-Derpy
Ghosties: Nope, learning to drive never interested me
Hey Master-Derpy!
12o.o did he ever give you a reason?
hey Master-Derpy what have you been up to
12This is only weeks after I saw him at the shops and asked him if he was coming to our wedding or not.
12Nope
Hey Twi_Fi!

14o.o
/me facehoofs
12Strange :/
Hello Ninjazz|Challenge :)

Hello d3rb :)
12I am a bit hurt by this in all honesty >v>
04Still, Yoku, you couldn't have waiting until someone got home?
And why not...Kingdom Hearts.
Ghosties: Ninjazz|Challenge http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8y9/
oh and hi Twi_Fi XD
hey Twi_Fi hows your day been
06ahw, things like this happen
Hello Lil_B :)
12Been friends for years.. since I was 16
Hope you two are happy together Arti x3
What....
Yeah that sucks
;-;
Vordox square enix and disney double copyrights
Hello alexxm :) . It has been okay.
14:(
@ the andrew thing
12How about texting him and asking?
hey Twi_Fi
he's STILL not said anything?
06and knowing internetsites like Facebook, Twitter, Hyvex etc, its all silly .-.
Ghosties: I could have, but I doubt they'd be home anytime soon :\
alexxm: They still are Exclusives to Sony =P
Soital, won't help if he doesn't reply
But I like hugging Ghosties. c:
(except for one GBA title)
Vordox: ever play katamari damacy (spelling?)
12Well, he invited me and Xai to his engagement party a couple of months ago
12I supppose...worth the try?
I have to get that small screwdriver from my neighbor again, something is still not right with my little Casio Keyboard :/
12we couldn't go but we told him why
oh yeah, what happened at the sony conference?
12ahh o.o
Hello Alicorn_Prince_Shane :)
why is my screen saying "we are doing maintenance"?
Huh.
oh he's gotten engaged?
12then after that, I sent him an email asking if he could make our wedding (a bit last minute) but no reply.. none at all
14maybe he was busy? :(
Phase4: http://t.qkme.me/35rfe2.jpg
Owch
Rayman should be on allstars
Right.
Shimmer: True
louder!
12and then after that, I saw him at Morrisons so I went up to him and asked if he got the email, his reply was "oh yeh I did, I dont think we will be able to make it though sorry" so we said goodbye
yay
12Next thing I know, off his friends list :/
Shimmer first game i got for the ps2
There are many factors yo consider...
04Saved that, Shane
To consider
also, when does the Nintendo conference start again?
:)
14D:
3 hours 46 mins Lil_B
Ghosties: which one the one does not simply hug Ghosties ?
04File name: even boromir agrees
4 more hours Lil_B
12and yeh he's engaged to this girl he met right after he cancelled the Newcastle meet
how about the guy from uncharted
Mary Kate & Ashely Crush Course <---- LAWL! MUST VOTE!
well, I didn't know Andrew that well, but it's incredibly disappointing when people don't explain themselves.
Heh
04The picture
Ah, that gal
which is 11 PM in my place
sony owns digimon right?
Ghosties: k
alexxm: Nathan Drake is confirmed for allstars
12I sent him a message just now saying "Bye then :/"
valoreins|Work wow, soo soon? thanks
Shimmer sorry i didn't know that
http://www.buzzlol.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Meanwhile-in-Australia.jpg
np
From experience I know that it can take months before you feel ready to explain anything, but then you damn well do it, rather than just pull the goddamn disappearing act on someone you've been friends with for ages!
Apparently, he doesn't speak to ninjas, but when he does... he speaks to me. :)
alexxm: No need to be sorry mate
pony_1471 no Toei i think,
You know...Megaman's most X titles are PSx.... <.<
12I agree
derpy_pony: thats my internet cable
14same
030
12He's my oldest friend
what is he playing
12Has he stopped talking to you ever since he's been engaged and you didn't go?
12I only saw him a matter of weeks ago.. I don;t get it
Cole from Infamous
has dead space been on xbox
12Well.. no.. he had not spoken properly to me in ages
I think so yes
14people are weird sometimes
O.D.T <3 Must have characters..ALL 3 of them!
r we streaming e3
right thanks Shimmer
also the newsletter is messed up
hello everypony
Lottery will be held on Friday....
hi somepony_else
hey somepony-else hows your day been
http://t.qkme.me/35rfe2.jpg
Intermisssion will be held on TUESDAY
14something similar happened to me, but in a much more complicated way xD
OH!
14I still miss him, but heh...his loss
Parasite Eve
hi Lil_B and alexxm .)
what is this? :D
I think that might be a typo
12Viri one day I will reply to your huge message :>
12XD
One day I will an hero and everyone will cry
14ok xP
12He's taken Xai off as well it seems..
And then I can laugh at everyone and go "Y U NO CRY HARDER"
o_O
Nariko from Heavenly Sword would be an awesome char for allstars
Hello somepony_else
Intermisssion will be held on TUESDAY?
hi Twi_Fi
Arti he still has you on Steam, but i've no idea if he's even on there
or whatever
LAWL that bad interview by Sony XD
12has he deleted his FB, thats a possibility?
they did so bad Nintendo is the winner by default
are we streaming the nintendo conference?
12Nope it;s all there lol
(please say yes)
i hope
heh
12Thats how I realised he'd taken me off, I went there and it said "Add as a friend" D:
12Oh I see :/
maybe they've got something planned for tuesday...
who wants to watch LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE?
mhm :/ facebook isn't all-important, but when someone has been that dodgy with you for ages then...
04...man, if Crash isn't in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale I'm going to be *incredibly* disappointed and won't feel the urge to buy the game
12He might be hurt you didn't go to his engagement even though you had a valid excuse
Indeed
04So "No Crash, No Buy"
12and if he;s a stubborn person...?
Crash is THE icon char for PS
after whatever happens
Hard to say
Ghosties: I'm not buying it unless they ACTUALLY CHOOSE people that HAS characters... ._.
12He's not like that
12Trust me
04And I'd much rather have OLD Crash, please...new Crash is really, really creepy
12Okies :3
04He doesn't even look right
TAI FU!
12It's a bit odd though, I hope you get a reply =<
are u streaming ghosti?
14same
12I personally think that he knows we've drifted apart and instead of coming to an agreement about it, he thought he'd just silently take me off and hope I don't notice >v>
04HOLY
04SHIT
04Tai Fu
Crash with supers: aku aku and his go-kart
04Oh my god
12but I replied to basically all his FB updates lol
04...holy fuck
>.>
04It's been...
04years
Ghosties you okay?
04Jesus
04You mentioned a name I hadn't heard since my childhood
04Fuck
04Great
04Now I wanna go on a Tai Fu binge
You have NO idea how long I've been into gaming and games. :P
suddenly childhoodgasm
Holy shit I had to google it cuz I forgot the name
Tai Fu was awesome
/me whispers to Vordox "Whats Tai Fu?"
Could be.
Meh, that's nothing. You should see what happens when people mention that one card game show from 4kids.
12Even if you drifted I wouldn't delete a friend of mine I haven't spoke to for a little while, it's not like you had a huge argument or something o.o
/me leans over to Lil_B and whispers short."A beat em up game with 3D element back on PSX, it's like that Kung Fu Panda, but about 15 years earlier"
12Yeh.. well I guess he wants to completely forget that part of his life
12I see :/
And with a kickass skinny tiger instead of a fat panda
04Man...Tai Fu...wow
unfortunately some people are very avoidant, and prefer not to address things that could potentially be upsetting.
04...I wanna play it again
dis song :D
Emulatortime!
Calm down Ghosties ...these are just "Thoughts" on All Stars
/me Whispers back to Vordox "Thanks... I gonna google that real quick"
04No no, I know
isn't it supposed to be Tai Chi?
/me nods happily at Lil_B
04I'm just saying I wanna play Tai Fu again
not Tai Fu
Invi: and Airpuff meet Twi_Fi <-- thats ur grandmaw Airpuff and Invi
04HAH, I still remember the tagline for the game!
Ghosties: You know there is the whole PS2 era too...:P
Ghosties: you should totally screw TF2 and go stream some Tai Fu
O_O
Oh
14!weather cologno monzese italy

14o.o
Hey ImOkayWithThis.
For me, Digimon is the MLP of Anime. It has Real Emotion Drama And Tension and it takes its Audience seriously
The silver snakes always lost
yo Ninjazz|Challenge
14I remember they DDoSsed a hosting website called Aruba because they could steal all users' credit card informations
Twi_Fi: if u havent seen it http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl8uv/
:)
Same For Detective Conan, for a Kids Anime it was amazing
14but I could remember wrong xD
DRF said that the host/hetzner thought he had a virus (Most likely dream world hax program) so his account went byebye
:s
14oh

00,02i'ma play prop hunt

14reporting to cyber police?
DDoS has nothing to do with security tbh

00,02too much lag for anything else
Airpuff: its a quick meme lol
you can't protect against DDOS really.

00,02heck, lag interfears with that too
LOL Viri

Ghosties: They didn't abondon it
Abandon*

uh oh
It DID come back after all.
lo
I so BADLY want to see it and have no idea where to watch it
they have better things to do than sift through 600k lines of DDoS logs
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :D:D Awesome
04But it wasn't Tai Fu ;_;
:D
can i join what sever is it
04It was a spiritual successor
04Like Bioshock to System Shock
Ghosties: And now that Kung Fu Panda is big hit...Maybe Tai Fu makes a cameo or becomes a part of it?
time to sleep
I wonder if its normal if i scream at this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ljjOTbLjg ?
14I guess so x3

DitzyHooves: Old news, and no links during stream
04Huh, so Dreamworks actually was the developer while Activision was the publisher
/me hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane
It's the Star Wars Trilogy like you've never heard it before! Join voice actors Billy West, Tara Strong, Maurice LaMarche, John DiMaggio, Kevin Conroy, Jess Harnell and Rob Paulsen as they re-create the magic of the Star Wars films
The ACIII demo was really good :)
DitzyHooves: Most of us already heard the full thing
So BG&E2 is on it's way?
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17036030/lolidonteven.gif

One beatiful day,I was driving with my dad.And then I remembered the number 5.And I suddenly forgot how to draw it,it explains that im stupid.
they do multiple voices
04Also, ACIII was fantastic
Kandarihu: There was a Trailer once...
like the first scene Bubbles= Darth Vader
04Though I admit, I'm actually more excited for Watch Dogs
Lil_B: Bubbles as Darth Vader. That is all.
or something
14watched :D
04But that naval battle was BADASS
My opinion on AC3 was changed immediately.

I still have to finish AC2 Ninjazz :D I'm looking forward Rayman Legends and Last of Us :$
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :|
Invi same here (after all we live in the same country XD ) thats why i can't really tell other people about MLP

E3Surge: AC2 was great. Last of Us looks amazing.
E3Surge: look forward to the ending of AC2, it's awesome ^^ and also get the sequel, brotherhood, it's a vast improvement to AC2 imo
And for SEVERAL years now
Lil_B yeah. I live rather at the countryside here. I guess i am the only one who knows about MLP in the whole town ^^
Lil_B: some also for CCS and earlier, like Sailor Moon, Jam, Care Bears, ... and fans of Gadget Hackwrench or Babs Bunny
/me throws potatoes at Alicorn_Prince_Shane in rage
Airpuff: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pl95b/

Just so you know Ghosties ...Sweden is currently one of the biggest indie scene coming up in these next years :P

Not to mention, there is ALOT of game making even during School Courses in High School

Everyone knows Wii graphics vs PC graphics is a good argument.
Wrek|Dusty: dat jajamensan xD
I do NOT care about graphics
04I figure you must have heard me talking about how awesome Sweden is for making great horror games
Vordox yes, both just have different stiles of controlling,
I personally think graphics are fine
04Wait, Vordox is Swedish too, yes?
indeed
Ghosties: Eeeeyuuuup
04Haha
Wrek|Dusty when you play amnesia, do you set up a webcam? :)
04Well yeah, you guys and your country rules
Invi: its a sweedish expression for.. yes.. pretty much.. :S
I live near Sweden, we're on the same planet!
Ghosties: It's currently on the downswing, but we're trying. :P
Anyway, back to E3, I also was fairly impressed by Watch Dogs
04@Invi: Then Wrek would be PEWWWWWWWWWWWWDiePie!!

I like eating pasta in chinmneys covered in cherries
Wrek|Dusty: The voice would be enough. :D
Jim: and im serious about it being chimmy cherry sauce. i am dead serious

04Even though the main character for CC does have blue/purple hair
apparently
So it's not Chrono Trigger? :P
Ghosties: chrono trigger has my fav rpg combat system with the co op attacks
I can upload firmware onto it
Vordox: nope.avi
Ghosties: So you like RPGs?
which it installs
04Nope, Vordox
04Yes, E3Surge
Ghosties: Alright. Hmmm
ddwrt.
Ghosties: okay have you played star wars knights of the old republic?
I don't know about RPGSs but I sure love Rocket Propelled Grenades!

That is so good to hear, Wrek.
R.I.P trololo guy

041999
Lil_B: chrono trigger has best rpg mechanics for me with the co op attacks and same screen battling. no going PSSHSPOSDFHPODS then another random screen
Ghosties: lol day of lavos
05though I miss Rip Torn but meh
INB4 They're running Windows XP and are a part of a botnet :{P

Blue Purple, the late era of PSX...
...
An we talked about Swedish people before...
LEgend of Mana?
04Nope
Wrek|Dusty: FFVI or FFVII have you played either of these? if so which do you like better?
No wait, that main char is Brown/Light haired
Bronysith I can fully understand why people like CT, with these Combo Attacks and such, I'm personaly just didn't liked playing it.
Name a game that sucks that was released in 2011!
04Man you just can't stop getting autokicked :D
05FF is not my kind of game
05never liked any of them
Lil_B: ughhhg. *gags* everypony is entitled to their own opinoin
Who's getting autokicked?
Wrek|Dusty: understandable. whats ur fav rpg of all time?
04Vordox
I'm trying to write how I talk :P Short and easy bursts
04Right
04Well
You SURE it's SquareSoft...?
04Yes

04I'm looking at the cover of the game right now
04And it says
04"Squaresoft" on the bottom
Well, any ideas of what you should do now? xD
05elderscrolls probably
morning, everypony! :) *yawns* how are we all today?
Ghosties: Parasite Eve? :D
Hai Sylandest :)
/me crash glomps Sylandest
hiya Sylandest
04Not Parasite Eve
Parasite Eve has a female lead in Light Hair
moin Sylandest. may i offer you a coffe?
Ghosties FF9 or the Bouncer (or whatever it was called)
04Bouncer was PS2, main had brown hair
Threads of...fate?
/me hugs Airpuff, catches Bronysith, and hugs Invi
04And FF9's character had sandy blonde hair
04Not Threads of Fate
Invi: I'd appreciate a tea instead, if you don't mind, hehe
Lil_B: FF9 was not my cup o tea. FFX had a good story but FFVII and FFVI had my fav combat system in all final fantasies
Then I have no idea
06www.livestream.com/lusgamehouse o3o
Hello Sylandest

Invi: I will accept juice :)
Except for IS.
04I'll give you another hint Vordox

TheRandomkid321: so your a cod guy huh? everyone is entitled to their own opinions
04You're the long time gamer around here
/me hugs TheRandomkid321 why
TEXT WALL INCOMING!
Maybe in the future the writers of mlp will run out of ideas or the series will decide to make a new gen were mane 6 r old people and cmc r mane 3 and they go on pointless adventures like in g2 and its all cgi animated.. then bronies stop becoming bronies and the whole thing dies out and becomes for girls again.. god what a day that would be!
04I expected you to know all the obscure titles :D
08,01Invi: pun?
00,02eh
08,01who said there was a pun?
00,02lets see if amnesia streams
Ghosties: I know of them. But not pinpointing them :P
Oh
04Hehe
Brave Fencer was made in 1998s.. XD
Ghosties: not an ACTION RPG :D
Invi: perhaps the pun was in there being no pun at all? :O
04Yeah, I was wrong about that
04It was 1998
Bronysith. I am a cod/battle field guy. I have tried TF2 but I just didnt like it... probably my mac cuase it takes 5 minutes to load a map.
08,01Invi: meme?
08,01who said there was a meme?
00,02i have bastion and superbrothers swords and sorcery but their very single player things
04I consider BFM an RPG
Not sure on how the game was. But dat hair XD
TheRandomkid321: i dont like cod or bf cause its mostly catered towards little kids and its the same game every entry and BF3 catered towards noobs with the ultimate shortcut pack
RPG blue/Purple(WOW IN A JAPANESE RPG) <--- Dem clues man
If you want to hit a DAMN AWESOME GAME Ghosties
08,01Invi: 9gag?

Good luck to you, Phase4.

Ghosties: Letter Clue; starts with Sh
Wiis are for fags. JK I am just quoting a show.
Sylandest: ahhhh. that would be fun
TheRandomkid321: i dont care if your joking or not. DO NOT USE THAT WORD!
Evil_Spike: Platformers are the shit :$

Im popout. See if that helps. It helped ONCE!
Hello pyrocatboy
/me doesn't find Amnesia scary at all.
it glitched out when i made it to the water part, and i never played it again :P
04A horror game is only as scary as how immersed you are, and often times getting stuck will take you right out of that immersion
Dat OCD.
Seems okay now... My wallpaper is distracting me though
Ghosties: Truth that is
00,02no, seriously, where do i go
Daniel4: google.com
Daniel4: its in that room
You need to fisnd stephano!
Daniel4: want me to tell you?

Morning all.

Wrek|Dusty: hah!

Bye, I'm back in 90min XD, ready for Nintendo (well, as long as I don't see some people reasoning again about why the WiiU will fail because of their new controller, not thats it impossible, I'm just saying that the arguments are so wrong about something so inpredictable)
so what movies did you guys pick for lottery this week... (the contest)
SirGanjalf: mostly impressive gameplay.
Lil_B: laters! Take care! :)
bye Lil_B
I am applying a Luna THeme to my Google-Chrome.

Sidekicks - that movie with nuchaku and Chuck Norris
There was scream?

I didn't hear anything.
So no bros can tell me if stephano is in justine?
cachi01: Yeah, the fight scenes were intense
Sylandest oh sorry thats just what i picked for the lottery this week
Horrible graphics, in my opinion. But I guess the Graphics aren't what's important in a game.
alexxm: oh, so...wait, have we picked already or are we still picking?

Minecraft.
Manecraft
craftmine
Mine Little Pony.

BARRELS!
NeinCraft
Minecraft does have better graphics than this.
Minecrosoft

Wrek|Dusty: Dont have any oil?
Hmmm...I suddenly can't connect to Steam to continue adding friends, nor can I view the stream...
