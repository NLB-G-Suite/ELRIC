03well they want everybody to stay at the same company for all 4 years

hi everypony
Saw that coming... :D
12o.o did he ever give you a reason?
12This is only weeks after I saw him at the shops and asked him if he was coming to our wedding or not.
12Nope

14o.o
/me facehoofs

Hi xP
:P
Guardian's Crusade!
12thanks
12I am a bit hurt by this in all honesty >v>
04Still, Yoku, you couldn't have waiting until someone got home?
And why not...Kingdom Hearts.
06ahw, things like this happen
12Been friends for years.. since I was 16
Yeah that sucks
;-;
14:(
12How about texting him and asking?
he's STILL not said anything?
(except for one GBA title)
12I supppose...worth the try?
12we couldn't go but we told him why
12ahh o.o
why is my screen saying "we are doing maintenance"?
Huh.
oh he's gotten engaged?
12then after that, I sent him an email asking if he could make our wedding (a bit last minute) but no reply.. none at all
14maybe he was busy? :(
Owch
Rayman should be on allstars
Right.
louder!
12Next thing I know, off his friends list :/
There are many factors yo consider...
To consider
:)
14D:
Heh
04The picture
which is 11 PM in my place
12I sent him a message just now saying "Bye then :/"
http://www.buzzlol.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Meanwhile-in-Australia.jpg
np
From experience I know that it can take months before you feel ready to explain anything, but then you damn well do it, rather than just pull the goddamn disappearing act on someone you've been friends with for ages!
Apparently, he doesn't speak to ninjas, but when he does... he speaks to me. :)
12I agree
14same
030
12He's my oldest friend
12Has he stopped talking to you ever since he's been engaged and you didn't go?
12I only saw him a matter of weeks ago.. I don;t get it
12Well.. no.. he had not spoken properly to me in ages
14people are weird sometimes
r we streaming e3
also the newsletter is messed up
hello everypony
http://t.qkme.me/35rfe2.jpg
14something similar happened to me, but in a much more complicated way xD
OH!
Parasite Eve
I think that might be a typo
12XD
14ok xP
12He's taken Xai off as well it seems..
And then I can laugh at everyone and go "Y U NO CRY HARDER"
o_O
or whatever
12has he deleted his FB, thats a possibility?
12Nope it;s all there lol
(please say yes)
i hope
heh
12Thats how I realised he'd taken me off, I went there and it said "Add as a friend" D:
12Oh I see :/
maybe they've got something planned for tuesday...
after whatever happens
Hard to say
12He's not like that
12Trust me
12Okies :3
04He doesn't even look right

04Now I wanna go on a Tai Fu binge
You have NO idea how long I've been into gaming and games. :P
suddenly childhoodgasm
Tai Fu was awesome
Could be.
12Even if you drifted I wouldn't delete a friend of mine I haven't spoke to for a little while, it's not like you had a huge argument or something o.o
12I see :/
04Man...Tai Fu...wow
unfortunately some people are very avoidant, and prefer not to address things that could potentially be upsetting.
04...I wanna play it again
dis song :D
Emulatortime!
04No no, I know
isn't it supposed to be Tai Chi?
04I'm just saying I wanna play Tai Fu again

aurgh.
14:(
04Not "made" but certainly published it
I can't get into the server atm
14is there anything you can do about it?
Well, yeah DDoS attacks aren't very pleasant, but I don't .. argh. I'm sorry to hear
14increasing security?
:)
"You've won two pendants in the Temple Games. WHO's going first?"
00,02i'ma play prop hunt
14reporting to cyber police?
DDoS has nothing to do with security tbh
14(I think that's the correct name)
you can't protect against DDOS really.
lol reporting to the authorities?
o.o
Abandon*
uh oh
It DID come back after all.

04And it says
04"Squaresoft" on the bottom
05elderscrolls probably
04Not Parasite Eve
Parasite Eve has a female lead in Light Hair
04Bouncer was PS2, main had brown hair
Threads of...fate?
04And FF9's character had sandy blonde hair
04Not Threads of Fate
Then I have no idea
It's not MADE by SquareSoft then
Saturn: .... really?
Saturn: REALLY?!?!
Published, YES; made, NO :P
Saturn.. slowpoke
04Published and made by Square
Saturn: I actually sang that un tune to the theme song
I decided to check up a games list of SquareSoft

04I meant Tetsuya Nomura, sorry
00,02meh

04I consider BFM an RPG
RPG blue/Purple(WOW IN A JAPANESE RPG) <--- Dem clues man
08,01Invi: 9gag?
08,01who said there was a 9gag?
Saturn: deny all the things XD
Yeah it's a shame BF3 is going down the same path as CoD now.
Even got all characters up to 255(The Very end of the game)
