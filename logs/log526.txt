Bye MahBoi777
what movie is this??
FATALLITY
wait isnt like half of japan covered in radiation
what show is this
Ninjazz|Observant: Waaaaaaat!?
The internet?
I used to be a adventurer like you, I used to wonder what Friendship could be, but then I took a Fluttershy to the heart.
bloodybrony: they werent nukes obviously
/me hugs AgentKalim, Lil_B, Ponies47, alexxm, Om, Ninjazz|Observant, Reikim|Spy, and Starflash
bloodybrony: Yes. It's called UV radiation. It comes from the sun.
4chan and reddid was all over it
Om: Hmmm?
^_^
Next stop: YOUR DOOM
lol i supose that answers my question XD
Ninjazz|Observant: eat some toast.
Seriously though, I think ive fallen in love with Fluttershy, shes my current pony crush.
what movie is this??
Om: I have tea. :S
Dat writing
Ninjazz|Observant: So close.
x3
that was too easy
well this kid is evil
:(
TIGHT security
Strange. Fluttershy, Twilight and sometimes Rarity are the ones most susceptible to pony-crushes. Dash gets a few, Applejack gets none at all, and Pinkie...well, most people treat Pinkie as a hyperactive younger sibling.
i feel like derpy hooves
:3
Nyria may i pm you?
Panda: Of course ^^
Spy: you mean you feel like Derpy_Hooves?
Panda: I smell the fur of a Panda man!
Reikim|Spy A while back my pony crush was Celestia
Om xD whats up
Rex_Mundi: That's quite unique. Never heard that one before, though Luna is also popular.
hey i have a crush on pinkie
the missles were fired by the united Mothers of the World in an attempt to make Japan less wierd
no, i feel ingored and forgotten....
shes so happy
poor applejack
i wana wife like that
Lil_B: And they failed.
D:
/me gives some love to Spy
Panda: Nothing much. Layin on my couch, wathing a socialy awkward japanese
If you don't like Luna and/or Derpy your not a true brony O_O
ya i like boath
Om haha well im just drawing ^-^
Reikim|Spy Mothers tend to make bad decitions that lead to nowhere
BBBFF in law?
Panda: Fun stufs!
Oh, wait, am I still a spy?
/me de-spies
BBBFF in law
Om hehe kinda...
My brother is not my BBBFF :|
Better.
Panda: Not so much?
BBLBFF
BBiLBFF
Reikim|Spy- Celestia is pretty, and powerful, with a great voice
LochNessCheez that was my first thought XD
celestia can lift up the frigging SUN
whoa!
its white!
Om haha wish it wasnt as suggestive of a request xD it makes wrekys stuff look tame xD
what?
Panda: Ahh. That kind of drawing :D
Well, I don't think she physically LIFTS it
MLP Blindbag?
where did he get the drink
hey guys
Goodbye :'(
Om yeah... my first one xD i mean i did draw some sugestive pony stuff... but never posted
Hello there, alexxm.
ROOOMAAAAAAAAAAAAANCCEEEEEEEEEE
Ninjazz :)
I can't believe "Brave" was such a letdown for me
waitwhat...pony crushes? :D
and then she fell
Reading Maxiburgers blog, the page about "the stair" master, it seems the Japanese really like Fluttershy a lot too (and thats no surprise)
Panda: Yeah. I would belive that.
Panda :3
and then he pushed her off
I heard romance?
Rex_Mundi: You mean Tsundere? Or Yandere?
that was a joke, right?
Om haha why you put it that way? They were all requests xD
I just realised
twilight_sparkle i was just about to say that, they boath fell and then the boat leaft without them
derpiboo.ru is full of hardcore nsfw stuff... I dont mind suggestive, but those are over the top for me.
Ninjazz ^-^
You can always put on a filter on derpiboo.ru
Its the Internet.
Panda: I'm sure *all* of them were :)
hey Ninjazz hows your day been
And yeah, there is a filter... right?
AgentKalim: I know, and now I do :)
alexxm: Good.
This guy looks so slimy
the guy was like: Whoa! this guy has the same phone as I do, this means that he must have lost his memory too!
seriously, pony-crushes, this is a joke, right?
Om no they really were... i dont have that good of an imagination
lion king :3
Panda: Don't sell yourself short mang
Look boi, Central park
Spy: You haven't been here long, have you?
ha! $700? I didn't think her car cost her that much to fix
Vordox- The words "too cute" and "moe" were used. And one guy said he wanted to marry Fluttershy
no...
Om im not D:
does the stream keep buffering for anyone else
but how did you know?
alexxm: It's "Stuttering"
Spy: I can tell.
Actually, the stream is giving me a "this website is offline" message now
Panda: Okay oookay. Just draw happily:D
Which is weird, but I am getting some white backdrop on the chat
So... maybe its just me
WAIT HOW NEW IS THIS MOVIE
Ohboy 9/11
flutter_spin yeah i just got that
alexxm: a bit laggy for me but no buffering
flutter_spin: Now that's not mormal.
*normal
They refed 9/11, oh mah gawd. D:
Spy- loads of people get pony crushes, its normal
9/11 bring your plane to work day
/me 11,01hugs flutter_spin

/me laughs so much he falls of his chair
Ah, I see it's been long enough that we can make dark jokes about 9/11 now.
Ground zero. How romantic.
woot! Nit hugged me
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
Panda: One reason I don't really take requests, among other reasons.
any ideas why you're getting that flutter_spin
it doesnt really sound normal :D
sooooo... what'S this show actually about?
/me hugs Nittany_Discord "Hug me goddammit"
oh...now
Om hehe i dont mind, it actually broadens my drawing style

08,01more Eden of the East?

08,01Reikim: several other animes
yeah, a bunch of weirdness
i guess nobody wants code geass..
this eden of the east is awesome
08,01none of my scifi has downloaded fully yet
Lil_B no I didn't, actually. Thanks for the heads-up
next episode plz :)
...?
YA SHOW MORE I LOVE THIS
i still dont really believe it
08,01Code Geass, Ghost Stories, Elfen Lied
Next ep plz
Elfen Lied.
elfen lied?
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
yes please
AgentKalim: np :D
My vote.
08,01oooo
08,01misfits
type 1 if you vote for elfen lied
of is it?
08,01Vordox: really? since when?
I vote for eden of east :)
/me kicks router
08,01Vordox: i'll need to check up on that
"What you do this time?"
elfen lied, and if not then eden of the east
Spy- Trust me, people get crushes on fictional characters all the time, pony crushes just happen, and then dissapear after a short time.
how come Vordox
11,01Elfen Lied has too much nudity to be shown on here with a normal stream.
alexxm: It's too graphical
I thought so.
Hmmm.
meh
Ghost in the Shell. There. That's all I need.
Elfen Lied is too graphic.
/me has trouble, he cant stop laughing
08,01Panda: of course
Nittany_Discord: that bad, huh
08,01shana: nah, it's because my harddrive is failing
sluttering?
08,01it keeps getting read errors
So yeah, my vote's for Code Geass, just because it's fun to see the Lancelot tearing through mooks.
11,01I love Elfen Lied though.
:P
Wasn't the first 5 min of elfen lied rated the most violent intro in anime history.
is this a amv or the opening
Nittany_Discord: same.
Midnight_Splendor: No, not even close.
08,01that should be a bit better now
MLP has more nudity than a porno! think about that ^^
whooooa
08,01shana: heh, quad core i7 :P
ok, I have stream now.
true dat
11,01MLP is reverse porn.
Eden of the East?
11,01More clothes are sexier.
Indeed.
Socks~
TrixieBaconMuffin: SFW nudity even :D
huh
it's all about nekkid ponies
Nittany_Discord: That suddenly makes perfect sense
Nittany_Discord best irony ever
Nittany_Discord: Theiss Titillation Theory.
Hello Everypony !
suddenly it says this website is online
Nittany_Discord: Ikr, it's like a paradox
Nittany_Discord so THATS why socks are so risque
So anyway, what did we end up watching?
08,01how's it now?
Hello !
oh come now, we all knew that Nittany_Discord ... right?
ok there
hey Alister[S] hows your day been

Vordox: We aren't talking about silly humans.

Ah, more Eden of the East

08,01Vordox: 2 secs, i'll fix that
So what is this anime about?
Ninjazz: I'm talking about ANYTHING :P

08,01how's it now?
Ninjazz: Check nature for god sake, more clothes has ALWAYS been sexier, no matter what.
and apparently is a nigerian prince! he's got 8 billion in his bank account
flutter_spin: do you want a recap on what happened?
LochNessCheez how many details does he need?
ALL OF THEM
I'm still unsure if I want to see it shana . More wanting of a synopsis of the series
LochNessCheez: Seems legit.
If anyone needs a recap, this: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast?from=Main.EdenOfTheEast Should just about cover everything you need to know.

/me refuses chicken
hey Bronysith hows your day been
Reikim: I was tinking of finally getting that YT downloader program and get the episodes like that :D
/me dodges Freefall29 s pathetic attempt of a glomp
alexxm: It would be the Twitter and Facebook pages to my talk show.
Rex_Mundi: Fluttershy is <3
LOL
/me is sad. :'(
Om: Hey, can't blame a guy for trying. If no one ever tried, no one would ever get anywhere.
Smart dog.
MadSurge: Nonono, you just stream it off of watchcartoononline. If you can watch the stream without lag, you can stream it right off of there.
Panda: No. You belong to Rarity. Not the other way around. Just like me. Just like everypony.
i dont think that will happen to me, it sounds to weird
Lololol, more ground zero
GilDash: I'm fine with that, at times.
/me Hugs Freefall29
Freefall29: Why?
What's with the music in this anime...it's hurting my brain...
Ninjazz im... im... a slave???
her eyes are... creepy
Om: I'll keep that in mind. ;)
Panda: To a goddess. ;)
localiation :D
Ninjazz: Fool! I belong to no mare! Especially not Rarity!
is there actuall a ground one anywhere? or two?
Reikim: :O will do, sir/ma'am!
/me hugs Freefall29 whats the matter
I fear I have made a mistake.
Reikim: You've never been given the choice.
now hold on there Ninjazz , I belong to Luna and noponyelse
Ninjazz hm... :) me gusta
oh no. Amnesia? ugh.
well Ninjazz... I tried to glomp Bronysith and I missed. for that I am sad.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Luna approves of it, though. :<
Om mistake?
cool phone.
Reikim: Rejected. Rarity overrules.
Panda: Yes...
Reikim wait... we belong to fshy now? O_o
Freefall29: Try one more time.
BOOOM
what, no boom?
Ninjazz xD
/me glomps Bronysith
Ninjazz: Countered: Fluttershy could totally beat Rarity in a fight.
What are we watching?
what
/me dodges Freefall29 again
Reikim: Yeah... no.
flip a switch. There has to be an explosion
well I tried
Ninjazz: You have no idea.
hey Reikim whatsaup? pierced the heavens lately?
Ninjazz: ha, you triggered my trap card. Now we all eblong to Twilight
/me hugs Bronysith ;)
Reikim: We can solve that ourselves once Fighting is Magic comes out.
Ninjazz: Luna is Princess of the night and overrules anything you say
AgentKalim: when does it come out anyways?
:P
AgentKalim: Suggeston taken. Ninjazz, as soon as Fighting is Magic comes out, we are settling this.
Rex_Mundi, i dont think so, it is 1000000 times to wierd
Reikim OBJECTION! Fluttershy may have her rage on her side but Rarity has powerful magic.
*weird
ppfft
Reikim: I don't play fighting games.
I'm not sure, somewhere later this year?
MadSurge- aint she the greatest. Everyones heart belongs to Fluttershy
You know how many people use their phone during a movie?
Panda: What powerful magic? Finding gemstones and light telekinesis. Yeah.
http://i.imgur.com/HLQlh.jpg
Reikim have you seen how op fshy is in FIM
Ninjazz: :'(
flutter_spin: a lot?
she's cute.
/me sighs "Blind fools. Once Queen Rarity establishes her throne... You'll all see" >:3
Panda: She needs a nerf, yeah.
Panda: Actually Pinkie Pie is far more broken.
I just hope fighting is magic is balanced.... as in the mane 6 are given the most powerful moves
arnt
Reikim telekenisis is what jedi have... fshy is f(squee)d
Ninjazz: Please, Spitfire's got my number first. ;)
yeah, like a lot...
yeah, um... Pinkie Pie is second strongest sorceress.
possibly first
Reikim how is pink more broken? Fshy just stare kills everyone
Ninjazz: a classier world for a classier princess! :D
Ninjazz, do you ponycrush on Rarity?
/me pokes Ninjazz http://www.ebay.com/itm/170865117082?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_4502wt_1188
seriously! stop talking about these "pony crushes" im laughing my head of!
they have jammers?
GilDash: She's too busy going for all the members of the Wonderbolts and Dashie to have time for you. :(
Rex_Mundi: More or less obsessed.
Hello everypon3...
Ninjazz: Tsk, she always makes a little time for her favourite. ;)
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz holy shit i want!
Panda: Oh! I thought you were talking about Rarity being OP. Yes, Fluttershy is completely OP, and will be nerfed shortly. Don't worry, she's just enraged because Angel's not around yet.
hello legacyofvrak
GilDash: And just who would be her favorite? :S
What's Up?
Bronysith: :D There's so much true with that!
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Grargh!!!!
Hi there, legacyofvrak. Please enjoy your stay and remember, your soul belongs to the Elder God. :P
personally. i'm not a fan of fighting games
lol
Ninjazz: There are some thing you shouldn't ask me things
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz holy cow thats awesome
Ninjazz: Tsk, isn't it obvious? :)
Yeah :D
thinks
totally Bronysith
why does the dog have wings
Reikim haha, so she stares down everyone, extracting information from them telepathically and roasting their brains? O_o
Everlasting_Joy: very much so. WHATS WITH ALL THE ALICORNS?! and they have to be related to celestia or luna in some shape or form
What anime is this?
GilDash: Nope. Hasn't it always been Rainbow Dash?
legacyofvrak: pokemon
Hey everypony :)
Ninjazz- I understand, Rarity is usually my favorit most of the time. rarity is high class!
Hey again everypony, what are we watching? :o
RaveBrony: pokemon
Bronysith: that's why I don't want to make an OC :D
Hi, RaveBrony
Ninjazz: She's her No. 1 fan, not her favourite. ;)
this is what i think about pony crushes: it is weird, im sure it will never happen to me, and it is very funny
Rex_Mundi: Indeed! And incredibly fabulous!
MadSurge: my oc is not of the pony creator. it is actually drawn
Bronysith: =_(\
LOL! Bronysith - you see the new Dan Vs Fim Chainsaw Lollipop video?
Panda: If you think that's the only thing her stare does to you, you're in for a nasty surprise. Asuka's little moment in Evangelion looks light by comparison.
this guy has a phone. he means business man
He, AgentKalim :)
08,01Vordox: i do not
flutter_spin: wtf
What's boradcasting? Some anime show?
Bronysith: thank god :D
Hey... it seems like Digimon.. not Pokemon ¬¬
Reikim no.... that.... looked like it hurts! O_o
GilDash: I'm pretty sure RD would want things to be a bit more than just number one fan and considering RD's personality... I don't think you got much chance. :$
Spy: inb4 you develop a pony crush
It's Pokemon? Well, it doesn't seem like it...
08,01Vordox: i'll look it up
Oh
No it's Fullmetal Alchemist
like i said before Ninjazz ,person who makes that plush does commisions, save your money
Well i never watched that show before
you never watched DBZ? :O
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I will. :<
Yeah Freefall29 ...
ping?
oh, nevermind
By the way, whoever posted the Dan Vs. comic.../)
Ninjazz- and dont you just LOVE Rarity's accent?
I couldnt really get into DBZ
:\
Bronysith: digging the skunk stripes :)
But I dont like it very much
legacyofvrak: dont, i didnt like it, imo its very primitive
No, i never really did get much into anime...
MadSurge: eeeyup
WHY IS THAT JAPANESE WOMAN SO EASY AND AIRHEADED. urgh I cannot feel sympathy to her. EVER.
Rex_Mundi: Her voice was one of the things that I fell in love with!
I dreamt my brother walked in as I pulled up a pic of Luna wearing socks. Worst awkward situation ever.
Oh yeah, someday, someone has to stream Madoka on here.
^
lol flutter_spin :D
I return from unconsciousness once again for the third time today. ^_^
Ninjazz: You know it's a fake accent, right?
That dog is way too cute :3
hai guys
whats it about Reikim
*listening to Tron: R3C0NF1GUR3D - Fall
FairysHuff: Welcome back litterally.
Hey EpicPwnTime3
in the future there will be card games on motor bikes
Spy- it will happen, your heart will be claimed.
GilDash: I know every well.
Vordox: *Cuddles*
whoa
lol
no
GilDash: It's her voice though. :P
Freefall29: its motorcycles you dildo
Oy dont be so front. :p
you didnt get the reference Bronysith
Ninjazz: I know. She's worked really hard on it, I can't fault her. :)
"Look. I can call myself!"
alexxm: it's about magical girls fighting witches! :D
Freefall29: yes i did
Freefall29: its CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES
Is it just me, or does that car look a little...3D?
fail :D
I'm back and this time i am LIVE From North Carolina!
xD
hey EpicPwnTime3 hows your day been
alexxm: Er...it's complicated to explain. Especially without spoiling it. The best description I could give it is "An absolute, soul-crushing deconstruction of the magical girl genre, liek Evangelio did to humongous mecha only with cute girls and magical powers."
it will not
GilDash: How bout dat singing voice? ^_^
just needs a finger
he said motorbikes last time I remember it
madoka?
toooooooooooooooooooot
alexxm:*like Evangelion did
FUUUU-.
thanks Reikim
Is anypony else getting a white stream box?
So I tried out Krater a little bit. It's actually quite good and amusing
Ninjazz: Eh heh, yeah. :D
refresh Pinkies4thWall|Sleep
Pinkies4thWall|Sleep: refresh!
:D
Any good fan-made human versions of Rarity's dresses out there?
I guess you have to watch this full episode to get it, because i really don't.
Great music, well worth buying the special edition for. And they have alot of amuxing one liners. ^_^
alexxm: I'd recommend it highly. It's only about a dozen episodes too, so it's not like One Piece where you have to sit through 500 episodes and STILL not be finished...
what's Krater?
05Sumica
BRONIES HELP! THE REPLACEMENT TV THAT I USE TO PLAY WII AND XBOX ISN'T WORKING!
/me is not brony enough to get a pony crush
flutter_spin: did that twice with the embed and once with the url. didn't work
05got plasma tech on the way. soon i have pålasma turrents guaring my planet >:3
KABUKICHOOOO! <3 FROM GINTAMA.
Wrek: what game is this? or is this real life
Birds.
WreK: Meaning wtf? :P
Spy: Waaaaay ahead of you then ^_^
I'm screwed
Bronysith: Real life
Rex_Mundi: yeah, hangon
kidzrul434: tried turning it off and on again?
Yeah, I wouldn't put it past Wrek to own a planet. OR plasma turret.s

OH SHIT
Ohai Wrek :P

he doesn't even have a mistress
Dat knife.
Ow. . .

What a rookie mistake.
Policeman got stubbed by a random woman just being random, NICE COPS and stuff
Is Wrek on? Or is he gone?
05got around 15 guass cannons aswell
0510 battleships and 8 cruisers
05gauss*
hess full of coolaid!?
Umm, i thought that you couldn't post links while there is a broadcast?
seems ok
Wrek: EVE online?
did nobody saw the stabbing? or want to help him?
OH YEAH
Wrek: Ah you are ^_^ So I gave in and bought Krater
Hay everypony, Hay wrek.
Skype activated.
Wrek is probably gone :- l
flutter_spin- thats cool, but I meant real life dresses.
oh, like you can buy?
how do i send a message supposed to get to a person so it appears as a "pling" in that persons chatlog?
This is odd.
the third day in a row.
I come in and we're watching anime not ponieez xD
Yes this is very odd
Worst police ever.
13you have to sacrifice a virgin hard drive
?
hi Shizuka how are you?
RainbowBlitz: We stream EVERYTHING

And everyone is walking away like they've seen nothing.
flutter_spin- nah, just want to see what they look life IRL
poo and i was starting to like that guy
6....and drf isn't here
Woo~
Wrek: Yes. It's not ground breaking but it is fun. Great soundtrack, well worth the special edition. I listened to it while napping. And the characters have some parody one liners. Like the warrior guy will say "If it bleeds, we can kill it" in an arnie voice ^_^
Good stream everybody, good stream.
t'was a great show
suddenly Strg^C ?
lol Bronysith , well its the latest from the DAN VS FIM Archive

FairysHuff: Yes quite

Alright, what's gonna broadcast next?

"but the food weve stored is running out, and we cant grow in this cold"
/me throws Fluttershy at RainbowBlitz
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: *Shrugs* Cause I don't ^_^
and even though I love my boots this fashion's getting old
we're singing winter wrap up again
/me takes fluttershy home.
08,01diddutz: it's because it's bigger on the inside and makes funny noises
"and even though I love my boots, this fashion is getting old"
She's mine now.
ALL MINE
Nooo Fluttershy he's gonna do bad things to you!!!
We already sang Winter Wrap U ptoday. How about the pet song? :)
Why are we singing winter wrap up again?
hey guys
*Up today
I'm going to keep her.
Rex_Mundi seriously, for me it is rather IMPOSSIBLE
FOREVER
: throws self at self :P
yeah, we already sang it before
the time has come to welcome spring, and all things warm and cool
I'm tired of waiting for S3 :C
Hey alexxm :)

Heyo!

am i missing out on a stream?
08,01FairysHuff: yeah, mine's on its way out
LochNessCheez, :CCC
I don't know pet song. I always found that song more of a .. chatter than actual song
stream derped out
08,01that's why the video would sometimes stutter
alexxm: Yea no stream atm
GilDash: I was pissed off at the time but it's been two years. I have mourned.
08,01VioletVanilla is setting up
Spy- you still want to talk about pony crushes? Well, everypony here who has/had a pony crush, say so now!
08,01she'll be streaming in a minute
TRADING CARDS!
o:
Vivi! :D
Yeth!
what episode # was that?
flutter_spin: on motorcycles
FairysHuff: Well, I guess that makes much more sense. :)
We were talking about MLP cards before
the last one
thanks TOY_PON3 and Ponies47 had to deal with some internet issues
Wooo!
alexxm: That's all bad
08,01FairysHuff: it's just stuff i've downloaded
been dealt with
alexxm: Okie doki loki. That suckz :<
08,01FairysHuff: no biggie i lose it
I'll buy a couple packs, but $2 for what.. 4 cards and 'a stick of gum' isn't worth it
what i mean is that it sound litterarly IMPOSSIBLE
Trading cards? SO AWESOME (Insert dashface here)
http://fav.me/d4xdrzz THIS IS STILL THE BEST THING I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS
Indeed
btw owlicious
what?
you spelt Owloysius wrong
Spy- it happens
CrimsonPhoenix: CUUUUTTTEEEE....
chat derped for me again =/
Anyone know if Magic the Gathering will be available on Android Market place? I know it's coming to Apple I Pad
damn
owlowdjsjdjf
LochNessCheez: You're both wrong, its owlowicious
see now I can't spell it
is the stream derping for anyone?
hey everone. i'm back
really?
oh how i do love youtubes captioning system, as 'twere http://derpiboo.ru/19101
so the wiki was wrong?
LochNessCheez: Yeah.
FairysHuff when is it coming for the ipad first i've heard of this
Hey Eztio-- welcome back :)
I used to be a huge card collector. Now that my cards sit on the shelf, I'm not big on doing it anymore
So the site is broken on my Firefox browser, but not Chrome. that's fucked up
damn again
hey Ezito-- hows your day been
alexxm: Not sure. But I think it may already be out on Ipad
Was that Owl one of the things Hasbro dictated to be in the show?
/me found out that SuperBrony64 has Halo
no idea
CrimsonPhoenix: :D
I might finally be able to get a cell phone :D
alexxm: it's been good
08,01the correct spelling is Owloysius
Lauren faust said that its spelled owlowicious but it would have been closer to the real name if she'd spelled it owloysious.
Pinkies4thWall: It's the exact opposite for me
EVERYONE'S WRONG!
08,01as it's a corruption of the name Aloysius
EVERYONE IS PINKIE
Wait what.
EVERYTHING IS WRONG IN THIS WORLD; EVEN PI ITSELF!
How many Kerbals died last night?
TOY_PON3: on chrome are you getting white embed windows?
My name is Blue Leaf, that's that.
EVERYONE IS WRONG! IT'S canterlock!
08,01FairysHuff: yes
Pinkies4thWall: Yeah
Eztio--: probably over a 100 died
RainbowBlitz: CODE RED!
e_o
CANTERLOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
So if there are 137 cards total and you get 4 +1 for like $2... kind of expensive for me
TOY_PON3: by chance do you run Win7?
EVERYPONY RUN FOR COVER
Don't forget everyone. Pet Owls on youtube. Check it out.
I have to go... Bye everypony
I still dont trust that Owl, I expected it to start hooting evil at the end of the episode.
Pinkies4thWall: Yes ._.

You watching Pinkielicious, Blue_Leaf ?
who has a mac?????
TOY_PON3: did your win7 recently install an update?
flutter_spin: Not at all D:
I hate apple. Overpriced dookie
NO
Pinkies4thWall: Not that I know of
mac computers are pretty cool but just arent that powerful
^
i'm a pc

Mac's are good for professional work, but for entertainment/gaming.... hell to the no
hmm. mine did, and Firefox was working just fine prior.
http://dan-vs-fim.tumblr.com/post/17096740111 pffft
Alien ware does the job for that
I would only by a Mac ever if I wanted to do music composition or DJing. And even then I'm pretty sure I could run that off a regular laptop.
*buy
I use Firefox for ALL my heavy browsing.
i allways use chrome
Pinkies4thWall: That's weird
flutter_spin: ;_;
I use ROyal Mail ^_^ HAH!
Eztio--: ^
Okay...okay...silly question here...WHO HERE USES INTERNET EXPLORER?
GREATINGS... from the past. I am communicated to you from the year of 1999. Now tell me, what are thes PONIES you speek of?
funny. I have Chrome, Firefox, AND IE installed
I has a HP Pavilion 754n. It is a old old model :(
i don't think may people do...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ&feature=channel&list=UL
Pinkies4thWall: But do you ever USE that last one?
Rex_Mundi: When you get back to 1999, buy me some Apple stock kthxbai
Reikim: lolno
So..my question is...what is with all the weird things going on in TF2?
i have a pavilion dv5
Pinkies4thWall: is there a difference between normal and heavy browsing?
Pinkies4thWall: /)
Rex_Mundi: there seems to be a bad connection. they are spelled pony's. not ponies. its 1999 so that explains it
06Reikim: You can, music production though the software on a mac ist normally more preferred~
Apple does some good things, but they just demand so high licensing fees that nobody adapts to their Technogogyls (like the Thunderbold-Cable)
/) Reikim
/me glomps VioletVanilla
hi VioletVanilla
VioletVanilla: how are you today?

I see dead ponies... e_o
i wonder wat VioletVanilla tastes like...wat?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I think Vivi is the only mod I haven't actually met yet. Properly.

Vivi: I make a habit of not assuming somepony's here unless they speak.
Ninjazz: did you like the rarivid?

Pinkies4thWall: I didn't catch it. :(
CriticKitten: That's pretty much it

Pinkies4thWall: Because IE sucks?
Shockwave crashes a lot in my chrome browser

Lil_B: I refuse to accept IE and remain steadfast in my fotress of Firefox.
08,01and they were laughing so much that she couldn't scan item through anymore
Ha.
Reikim: should try Chrome
I am also a steadfast proponent of Firefox.
sagas[A]: Have, don't like it
Anyone else go see "Brave"? I want a second opinion.
Anybody here get any strang looks whilst buying pony toys/
Reikim I don't want you to switch XD the best browser usually is the one you are most familiar with, I'm, just saying that IE9 isn't bad XD
Okay, bye everyone, I'll be back later.
Reikim: Well to each their own. I feel the same about Firefox
I give the award of "Shittest program known to man" To google chrome XD
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: pretty much

alexxm well...
08,01i can't wait for it to be finished
Im still creeped out by that pic of lyra with the human and the suger cube, and the fanfic it is based on. Why did people on EqD think it cute?!
08,01Saint CriticKitten
Rex_Mundi i don't know what picture you're talking about can you PM it to me
The holiest of all kitten saints.
alexxm- NO! I dont want to look at it again! Sorry.
oh yeah Rex_Mundi . Totally. I couldn't stand looking at it
flutter_spin, soon, we'll see this whole piece all assemble
Blessed are the kittens, for they shall inherit the earth.
flutter_spin: woah imagine that was the animation...
Rex_Mundi how far back in equestria dailys archives is it then?
08,01that video gives me chills
I can't wait CrimsonPhoenix . I couldn't quite tell from the animation if Luna appeared to be 'stealing the kids (evil)' or just having an adventure (good)
Read the story in the blog
flutterspin- have yoy seen the fanfic? its like reading "cupcakes"
yeah. When I watched the Animation Kakumy , I thought "wait a second, I've seen this before"
or heck in the video description
alexxm- just a few days back
YAY MINE TURTLES http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI5_sQ8O-7Y&feature=related

Even her tests are graeshful!
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: YES A SONG ABOUT MINE TURTLE!!!
^
Ooooh, pretty colors
CrimsonPhoenix: that was...
The worst part is that 90% of the people thought the pic was adorable.
WWOOOOOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/32933/Farewell-Scroll my latest fanfic, heh
Suddenly all the violet and gold
I love these type of art
Rex_Mundi: Which picture?
Rex_Mundi: SHOW ME
whoa man... pretty colors man.... maaaaannnnn
Whats that godamn music?!
hallo VioletVanilla :3
ACID TRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP
Circus music+Chiptune beats, nice
Rainbow- the one with Lyra, getting petted by a human, licking a suger cube.
Rainbow: so that's the stuff doing that man? bummer
This song sounds...
I don't know, something special...
My take on EQD has worsened over the past few months.
is this why mario eats shrooms?
reading a bout flutterbunny
BRB
I don't know Jony_216 but I love it
Rex_Mundi: Can you show me the pic?
its just a few days back on EqD
this sounds something from portal 2
HOW DO I FIND IT
...What's this?
Bad trip man
You dont want to find it
Rex_Mundi: How come
This music stream~ :O
06c:
now it has wubs?
Ha, I knew it :3
I gotta lay off these groovy syringes man
flutter_spin: that frikin Lyra...
I don't get it, Vivi lives in the same country as me but i still get most lag when she streams; confound that technology ...
/me hugs VioletVanilla
yeah, well someone requested the pic
flutter_spin- thats the one
Back :P
I'm usually good at finding stuff :P
(btw, whats the actual musical Term for "Wubs" ?)
VioletVanilla: lol where do you get these tripping scenes?
They're just wubs. :P
flutter_spin: THe Lyra part of it is adorable, the human part... disturbing-ish.
Distortion?
Lil_B: Bass
what lyra? in human???
yeah Rain
flutter_spin- EqD should get better once season 3 starts.
No pony songs?
Probably because I find Lyra to be adorable.
ehh, don't care for this song
Who streaming btw?
Violet stream
I am entranced...
Lil_B: wub = wobble bass~
Kakumy: VioletVanilla
You can usually tell by what is streaming :P
Oh..
This sounfs familiar.
Starflash really? and the higher wubs?
Lil_B: I don't think there is one, so wubs are wubs, but i allso heard the term wobbles
sounds*
JUST MAH BASS CANNON!!!
Kakumy: also known as ViVi
Sunday is usually Violet's Radio Stream
I think the higher wubs is the same but pitched :D
When I saw that white blob, I thought of Celestia.
hai guys!
so what's a monday like?
diddutz ok, thanks :)
She cleans them... with WUBS
Rainbow- the pic is not really the problem, its the fanfic that its based on.
Well, most days are random, but my schedule has Monday as Wrek's Drawing Day
Lil_B: like me and Starflash sayd wubs= bass in the simplest of terms
Rex_Mundi: Oh... oh dear Celestia save us.
still wobble though :3
normal bass wouldnt sound this weird~
well i'll find the terms through-out the week then
i liek deadmaus
Yeah, its more like whoever is on...
/me raises his weapon.
I like Skrillex :P
meh
Someone gonna pick up the bass? It's been over 5 seconds.
The bass has been dropped.
Rainbow, it's supposed to be dropped, leave it be.
10asdf
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: you're right wubs are bass, but bass is not a good term to describe wubs
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz but Bass is such a big term, and i was more thinking about just the Dubstep like wubs
10Good, I am still connected
Well nothing to do so bye guys :D
bye Kakumy
Bye, Kakumy
Take care Kakumy.
Starflash: But the 5 second rule!

dang it! Why did one of the thousand random thoughts that rushed in my mind had to be "I wish I was Luna's socks"
flutter_spin: It works for those with a foot fetish.
I don't though
WOOT this song
this remindsme of a nightmare
Oh this :D
Or... Pony socks are hawt. Ever though about that? Hmmm?
VioletVanilla Are you doing your radio show right now? If you are, why am I missing it?
YAY! :)
DashWithRainbows: Tune in, nooowwww
DashWithRainbows: Get in here!
damn it all. derpy i love you so much but please STAY OUT OF MY COMPUTER
ponies in socks doesnt always have to be fetish. Theres some innocent and cute ponies in Socks art out there.
Whatever you're streaming, I still haven't gotten more than one and a half seconds of it.
socks. socks everywhere
06DashWithRainbows: Because you are not watching c;

i think it's just wmp visualization
Oh boy, my parents are arguing -__-
08,01so i've been reading about UAV drones today
08,01the things they can do with unmanned aircraft now, it's simply amazing
Dis cord
Dat cord too
Bronysith wut.
0,14fun fact: UAVs require three kills to call in :3
so random
08,01Bronysith: well, i postulate that in 10 - 20 years, we'll no longer have commercial airline pilots
06ITs not wmp visualization X3
SaxyPretender unless you have hardline bro.
who wants to bet some UAV's are made in China >.>
SaxyPretender: *Facepalm.
0,14touche
Spy Planes > UAVs.
SaxyPretender: Then it's two.
06MadSurge: ): Listen to the musik und be happy <3
08,01Bronysith: i don't think we'll ever have self-aware computers
*swedish spitfire voice* "Soarin's apple pie"
so, um... interesting stream
LochNessCheez: Ikr.
Luna's war ftw
0,14also, dat sad feel when jet pilots won't be relevant thanks to UAVs
08,01well, i certainly see the role of pilots being reduced from flying the planes to manual control if things go wrong
VioletVanilla: If I stay out of it they leave me alone, they're still loud though :D
08,01and not all flights having them
SaxyPretender: i hate to think of it
0,14ikr?
SaxyPretender: But less pilot error.
eewwww dubstep
pilot error is pretty low
SaxyPretender: Sadly, the same can't be said of the soldier.
unmanned flight =/= flight
you could go a thousand years flying once a day without crashing
0,14but that means a Top Gun remake in the future won't be culturally relevant
:(
D:
08,01SaxyPretender: see, silver lining!
you'd probably choke on a pretzel, though
0,14no, that's bad!
VioletVanilla: What is the name of this song? I want to find it.
08,01Everlasting_Joy: i think you're wrong there
0,14I liek Top Gun ;__;
You think the Mane 6 could ever visit a Japan-like area of Equestria? That would be neat.
06Luna (Alex S Remix)
VioletVanilla: Thank you :).
08,01Everlasting_Joy: have you seen what they're doing with robots these days?
and then a giant reptile could attack... did that
but SaxyPretender, you are a top gun.
08,01look up BigDog
Virtually everything that gets remade anymore is ruined. >_>
06Everlasting_Joy: (:
0,14also, all your faces when they are making another Top Gun movie apparently
"facepalm" at my previous comment sry violetvanilla
08,01but yeah, the military are going to have autonomous "soldier" land drones in 20 - 30 years
DashWithRainbows: i am # 49 on the ace combat global leaderboard. does that make me a top gun?
SaxyPretender: Not sure if good or bad thing at this point. :S
not exactly robotics, but there is the HULC exoskeleton too.
There might be a pony anime someday, like how Powerpuffgirls got one
08,01take it from someone who is familiar with the state of the art
SaxyPretender This can either go well or completly burn in a huge falling fireball of scrap metal.
and the TADS system on the apaches.

sagas[A]: if they get the idea they are suprerior then their creators, they won't like taking orders from what they find inferior.
Geez, transhumanists are a strange brand of people
Hey everypony
They are deterministic... for now
/me glomps Very_Silly_Filly
Nittany_Discord: What if it goes in and alters its own coding?
Finally healed everything
08,01VioletVanilla: we already have self modifying and self adapting programs
11,01Then we're screwed.
Hey there, Very_Silly_Filly! How is the hand?
The stream is working fine for the most part.
After around a month, my injuries are healed
Woo
i.e. Viri
Ninjazz|Observant: Hand's been fine a while, but a few small scars around it
BR34CH - by BlackGryph0n
like Flame and Stuxnet
VioletVanilla: computers can calculate and process, but they still can't really "think"
Im fine with AI's taking over
Teaching a computer how to program itself to adapt to a situation is more time consuming than just programming it to adapt to that situation in the first place.
*malware
VioletVanilla: Just because it'll take a long time, doesn't mean it'll never happen.
Very_Silly_Filly: Better than last time we last saw you though, at least?
You guys forget about howmuch bullshit have to put up with computers, im not worried about advance AIs
So it's not so much that it's impossible, it's just pointless.
08,01seriously, take a look at the state of the art in computer science reserach; some of the things that scientists are doing in the field at the moment are downright scary and straight out of science fiction
Im fine with this
Sounds good. ^^
08,01VioletVanilla: programs already exist that right programs, though
08,01*write
11,01VSF: Your hand is repaired?
06They write them ja but they only write what they are supposed to
00,10damn you mips why must you do this to me during Vivi's streaming
08,01CriticKitten: psht, this is science
Nittany_Discord: Around 90%
So then no. :P
what song is this?
BRB :P
11,01Does it work well?
Ikr Sumica :<
^
Yeah
08,01VioletVanilla: yes, but then, when you combine the two concepts, you can have programs that write entirely novel programs
well, there's watson, and what they're working on after that
08,01and this kind of stuff *does* exist now
My point is that it's easier to just tell the little robot drone how to cross a river than to program it with the ABILITY to program itself to learn how to cross a river.
DAT BUFFER
they're planning to have that as an assistant
Vive l'avancement!
06its buffering?!

today watson... tomorrow terminator style rebellion

Very_Silly_Filly: :) it's nice to know your wrist is better! Is your hand better?
:(

Teaching a computer to do something is called AI in a sorts isn't it?
/me peeks into room. I HEARS MUSIC.

0,14oh hai LadyCanary
It's LadyCanary!

VIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!
08,01honestly, i don't think computers will ever become self-aware
Hai LadyCanary! <3
06Sweetest bird!
dat LadyCanary
2 Years ago a Developer said, the Future of games will be determind by who makes the best AI, I don't think we will see true self aware AI, but I have been wrong before
/me hugs LadyCanary und Shizuka
Not buffering for me this time.
Yes those adaptive programs may only adapt in the way they are programmed, but its a start. Your brain is limited too. Its dependant on the balance of certain chemicals.
/me blushes ^^" Hello everyone!
is that the WMP visualizer?
It first has to recognize what a 'river' is, the real world is far too complicated for an artificial mind to comprehend, way too many variables. Any advanced AI would just seem autistic.
SaxyPretender: yeah, let's wait out on sentient programs
^_^
Hoooowdy there, LadyCanary. I remember you from way back.
06Its not wmp visualizer, its a programme called G-Force
back from dinner i miss much
A computer first needs a personality to become self aware.
I finished Zelda OoT Master quest yesterday
:O Whoa! AgentKalim! I remember you!
/me 13hides in vivi's mane
the goal is self awareness, not imitating humans
I'd like to know where mips.tv is hosted from. Whenever I'm having problems, a speedtest might be very helpful
oh yeah, g-force. true
Rex_Mundi: HEY! are you suggesting i'm an AI?
hey LadyCanary hows your day been
Pinkies4thWall: Yaes :3
/me 11,01hides in Shizuka's mane.
/me nuzzles Shizuka <3
11,01Hi LadyCanary.
/me hides in Very_Silly_Filly's mane
hello there LadyCanary
/me is put off by some ponies' thinking.
Dat mane hiding.
alexxm: Uneventful.
'dem selfaware ponies
/me hides in his own mane
Hi LadyCanary! Got more cosplay trivia to share? ;)
sagas[A]: the thought process is, but its backed up by an even more complex biological/biochemical system. an awesome combination :)
MadSurge: ^^" Not at the moment. Just that I wanna learn how to sew and stuff ._.
First, they need to program AI to not be retarded in some aspects
Not enough processing power for an AI to not seem bumbling trying to comprehend the real world. Its a pointless waste of time and money trying to creat something self aware, its a task beyound us.
I created my first advanced AI recently, and it's still a pain
Alchemist: Well isnt an advanced enough thought process all thats needed for self awareness?
BREASTS!
LadyCanary: and how are things?
Hi everypony!
I programmed a platform AI that can jump up platforms and see you from a distance
FairysHuff where
06icybeauti~ c:
Well...today is my special somepony's birthday, MadSurge <3
hey icybeauti hows your day been
Alchemist: So shouldnt computers eventuall reach that level?
Hey there, icybeauti. :)
Hiya icybeauti
08,01Rex_Mundi: oh, i don't think it's beyond us, i just think we'll wipe ourselves out before we manage to do it
alexxm: Here *Touches moobs*
sagas[A]: you need a hardvare to run it on and it seems that the current technology is far from sufficient.
Heya VioletGreySha Hi Ninjazz|Observant Hi LadyCanary and i alexxm.
08,01Alchemist: the way things are going to go is neural nets on quantum computers
LadyCanary: :O happy birthday to your boyfriend then!
icybeauti: i guess not me :P
06VioletGreySha <3
08,01and that may sound like sci-fi jargon, but i've worked with both
^_^ Im gonna make him cupcakes today~
i phone 5 is weired e_o
I meant VioletVanilla
Ohai icybeauti!
VioletVanilla: :3
Transhumanists are naive to the 10th degree.

Hey MadSurge
06Still buffering. . ? ):

hi icybeauti :)

I want quantum technology :c
VioletVanilla: yep
Hey Lil_B
VioletGreySha ~ hallo there.
Rex_Mundi whats a transhumanist never heard of them
VioletVanilla: A bit, but it will manage.
VioletVanilla: eeehhhh not really
I cant wait for the teleporter to be created
/me hugs Starflash
/me hugs VioletGreySha back~
:3
Freefall29: so we can become fat for good :D
hey VioletGreySha hows your day been
Time for a party.
This calls for a party!
party. pinky pie style
MadSurge: I wouldn't use a teleporter, unless I was going ages away
I have to leave the chat
alexxm: one word that describes it: Diablo 3
spys sappin mah teleporter
Well just finished a 3 hour TGS podcast I've been watched in bits over three days ^_^ Now to watch another.
so good then VioletGreySha
*watching
Why does the releated box get filled up with this stupid pony shit.
It isn't intresting.
Very_Silly_Filly: yeah, that's what I would use them for.
a good question is: how to give an AI the ability to find a solution to a problem for which it was not prorammed for, without giving him the instrucions to solv the problem.
Ain't no party like a Pinkie Pie party
05Chrysalis: the preliminary lsit is done: http://open.spotify.com/user/joish/playlist/0FDICVUwvEjQaauzVjRzf0
Pinkie's Lie insane version by Glockenzero
because the Pinkie Pie party don't stop
alexxm: i dont know if its good that i dont do anything then play it xD
Everypony knows the hookshot from Zelda? I want one :)
Did you guys do the movie raffle yet?
This song is VERY familiar. why?
I could get places so easily with one
imagine if there was beer at pinkie pies parties.... scary I know
Bronies deserve to be shot and killed.
icybeauti why not the portal gun
lol^
shut up SCP
sagas[A]: I didnt say it wont ever reach it, only that it needs more time.
No,
Vordox: It's called Party with Pinkie by Alex S
SCP: Unfortunately for you, I happen to take more than a few bullets to knock me down
I doubt any sane person watches this show.
Vordox: it's "party with pinkie" :D
Nightmare: Aha
Oh, DJ Alex
Very_Silly_Filly: i want the double hookshot
SCP how do we make your life worse
Imagine if there was a BEAR at pinkie pies parties O_o Scarier I know
Alexxm

you just said that in a hive of brony's.... SCP
SCP: you fail at trolling
Back
A bear with a GUN!
You can make my life better by stop filling up youtube
Eztio--: Double longshot would be beast
and go to another website and filling it up
god damn it.
SCP: then why are you here with us insane peiple??
hey Ponies47 your in time for the troll
That's it?
Meh I feal like taking a shower so be back in a few :P
sagas[A]: unless someone hits a big red button attached to a couple thermonuclear rockets first :D
SCP: its not our fault the show is awesome
SCP: We're not insane, we're just different
The thing is
Youtube is bad because of ponies
It was better without ponies.
How so?
Hey, youtube was bad in '10
Very_Silly_Filly: what i realy want is the fierec Diety's mask.
08,01and i'm back
Because it didnt get spammed.
Alchemist: :D If we made it through the cold war i think we'll be fine
08,01anyhoos, yeah
*Holds up hand* I'm insane. I have a letter from a psychologist proving it.
SCP: no, it was bad even before ponies.
SCP: Cool opinion bro
No
SCP: then stay off meme sites like youtube. go to any non meme spreading website
Eztio--: Pah, screw that, where's my Triforce?
The game
08,01neural nets are awesome: they're like logic circuits that learn
FreeFall
I don't care anymore,
yeah and teaching them is a pain
Bronies can die in hell and fuck off.
Very_Silly_Filly: Gannon took it
SCP: then why on god's earth are you on bronystate.net
SCP: you too :D
I don't know what to tell you. Hating on us isn't the answer.
Eztio--: Did he? I'm gonna blow him the hell up

08,01heh, trolls
okay, but you usually have a very specific goal in mind when using it
Awww SCP is gone. I was going to give him my sweet sweet lovin.

OHMYGOD

Ok, my Father would love this XD
WOO~
VioletVanilla: i love you
Burnout! anyone?
paradise city. :)
SCP perceives the prevalance of MLP related Youtube videos as an annoyance and he thinks that he can stop it by coming here and telling us to stop.
As much as I dont like GNR, I have a spot for this song <3
Nightmare: eeyup!
instant feel good for everyone: http://derpy.me/R0yX1
08,01it's like... what the hell do you expect to achieve coming into a brony chatroom and hating on bronies?
world peace?
08,01do they think we'll listen, or just ban them?
08,01there's no point to it
lulz?
Mips is lagging during a good stream :<
Lulz and ponies
08,01FairysHuff: ha! yes!
e_o

ObservantGunny, the problem might be on your end.
trolls are fun, especially when they leave because they sucked at trolling

Oh hey there LadyCanary~ ^^

Wrek: I do not :(. I don't think I'll get it, but I can link to it for others to find it if you want.
06Enjoying the bits you can see. . ? ):
/me hugs VioletVanilla back
Eztio--: trolling trolls is great ;D
Most definately.
welcome to the internet.jpg
I wouldn't consider someone like that a troll. He's just objecting to the entire Brony community.
VioletVanilla: I've got the music, and that's the best bit. :)
yet Troll TRolling skills have dimmed down
Is dat tr00?
WTF http://derpy.me/ou49y
VioletVanilla: Yes! Best bits ever!
trolls pretty much insult fan bases now... they used to try to be as offensive has possible. I guess the flame has died a bit
I was wondering if the community would be interested in a scheduled weekly Worms (Steam) stream that random community members could participate in?
Bronysith: i though it was a pinkie pie launcher
Bronysith he seems so angry about the situation as well
He's obviously an anti-brony who is having a lot of trouble using Youtube without running into Pony related videos in the suggestions. That guy's at wits end.
Coming to a brony stream does not fix anything, though.
we should do a steam event some time soon. counter-strike source?
I would like a Audio only option for the Stream XD not thats i don't like the visuals, they are just a bit too bright at times for me :)
If he comes back troll him by pretending to be gay.
http://derpy.me/0fu3T
06Lil_B: I will work on that for you sweetie (:
Copy that
FairysHuff: that would only help his argument dude
Kandarihu: it's not our fault if ponies go with anything and are awesome. :D
Ninjazz|Observant I agree. But I think that to him, it might've seemed like a good idea at the time.
FairysHuff: trolls accuse brony's of being gay... act gay would support their argument
Freefall29: Why? Nothing wrong with being gay. And it would drive him mad even more
Ace of Spades?
Hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooome~
Freefall29: homophobe are you?
Freefall29: So?
MadSurge: I agree with that too. I'd imagine that he might take his anti-brony crusade to Equestria Daily.
dammit my flashplayer crashed again
Bronysith: no. not that
Nothing wrong with driving trolls mad, if you ask me. Live by the troll, die by the troll.
Kandarihu: I can see his view point. Coming here to deal with his problems head on. Maybe even vent a little, but in the end... it was extremely foolish.
i'm just not gonna give trolls more cannon fodder
WHAT THE FLYING FEATHER is this the flinstones? http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/23033-your-argument-is-invalid
Freefall29: thats why you say. "YEs. how about you come over sometime"
being sarcastic
/me loves directly controlling the visualizer und changing colour tot he rhythm
But yes. Back to the weekly scheduled steam worms stream idea. Any mod interested in hosting it? And what does the community think?
ok Bronysith ... I still think its not a good idea
Freefall29: dude. it just pisses them off
/me hugs VioletVanilla ;)
Must be supahtr00
:p
Wait I just realized..
Kandarihu: ty. like how i say i dont care for this day aria
True enough.
06Rain~ <3
/me missed VioletVanilla <3
and he believes we're the ones making pony videos on youtube?
Kandarihu: not a popular opinion but im not trolling
05well Kandarihu: come into a brony site join the c hat and claim they should all die is pretty much trollin'
OMG RAIN! Rain!!!! <3
ewwww pinkie pie
YAY

You know what? In recent weeks, my church has started using some sort of visualizer for Praise & Worship. Although it doesn't seem to be responding to the music.

So which mod would I talk to about organising a weekly scheduled stream for casually playing worms and having fun with random community members?
CCCP: hay :P

how much does worms cost on steam FairysHuff?

Und dann Pikmin. Still waiting on the "Set them all on fire" button.
This cat of mine. When my mom and I adopted her 6 years ago, she's been absurdly clingy. She just wants to be loved at all costs. And she's finally figured out the best way to get it. Just napping within arms reach of the guy who spends his life in front of the computer.
I would love to see a mario/sonic game that isn't a olympic game.
O_O
Dont have one... I dont have access to poniess except on Weekends. D:

Evidence seems to suggest that the Wii U will be a bit over $300.
ARE YOU JOKING ME? I JUST BOUGHT THE ORIGINAL 3DS!
AND WHY NO PURPLE
Im going to miss this chat. I dont like Jobcorps, i wanna AWOL out. I wonder if I will?
IT PROBABLY COSTS A LOT OF MONEY
Glad I didn't buy the first one. I will take this one
SO I WON'T BUY
Probably $350 or sommat.
WHAT?
ONLY $200?
AJIsAwesome, it's a bit useless really
just $199.99
NINTENDO, Y U SO STUPID?!

199 is much better than 300
00,10that 3ds xl looks like a pain in the wrist.
True

But how many bits is it? i hear the jaguar has 64 bits.

Gee. I remember when everyone was loving on this guy
His body just isn't ready
He looks like a neanderthal. As smart as well.
right now
same shit in 2010
The reason the previous console did well is because it was sellable at a profit even for the original sticker price. They can't profit per unit sold at $200.
Then let Reggie learn more than a single intonation CrimsonPhoenix.
nintendo and his handhelds feels like milking the customers to me since the first DS

11,02This game is better than Diablo 3
anything is possible if you use mushroom body wash
I am not sure if I follow.
They should give you the feature of turning those coins into money in real life.
Goldfinger
SuperBrony64: i guess
Meanwhile: King Midas is jelous.
brb
SuperBrony64, did you just try to start a Diablo III flamewar?
Gold mario gold throws gold fireballs that gold turn gold blocks into gold coins. Gold
JUMP ALL OVER DEM BLOCKS
do you get coins for records
00,10so more or less they are taking modevation from automadic maro and turned it in to a game mecanic
SuperBrony64: I heard that ET for the atari > Diablo 3 C/D?
inb4 has lotsa lives from so much coins
WHat am I doing?
that's very convincing...
you dirt whore you mario
...
SuperBrony64: Too strong statement
SuperBrony64 - I could cheerfully punch you just now, but I'll be nice.
The pegasi of Florida cause it to rain right now.
true, but Valve wins on quality
SuperBrony64: Inb4 flamewar
Jew Super Mario Brothers 2
:D
AgentKalim: xD
And I do mean CHEERFULLY. I would be cackling gleefully.
SuperBrony64: i do agree with you ther
AgentKalim that is what they should call it.

NINTENDO IS FINISHED
Nintendo is going the DLC route?
It's called DLC, you derpbeast.
HOLY
SuperBrony64: No, you're trolling.

Nintendo selling DLC?
Sumica: The power of nostalgia
Shit not nintendo too
9_6
Hope it's free DLC

GIVE INFO
NAU
maybe it;s not that expensive
Is this tigger seriously presenting DLC as something new and exciting?
I hope...
GIVE ME FIRE EMBLEM INFO
not sure if online stores = dlc
I'm stunned. I've never expected Nintendo to start doing paid DLC.
11,02Nope, I'd buy a Nintendo game over anything else out there or even the Wii version of a multi-console game.
He said "full-featured" twice in the same sentence.
WHERE IS SHIGERU?!
Too long to wait!
Yep hell broken free. Nintendo is selling DLC
SOMEADMINPONY HELPPPPPPPP :P
he's serious. I once bought a nintendo 3ds, and pinkie jumped out of it. I have the confetti to prove it.
Y U NO LET MARIO DIE.
He's right though nintendo is better than all other game platforms, i admit.
Wow, a re-re-re-re-re-re-re-release.
Meanwhile: sonic needs to die first
Bronysith: Ikr.
Pinkies4thWall: Too many games to not be counted. :P
$2.99?!
Meanwhile: i mean they need to pull his plug. hes already dead
Bronysith: Dr. Robotnik would assist in that.
Meanwhile: Why let it die when it still makes money?

CriticKitten: Sadly that's Nintendo's answer.

Puppeh and Kitteh!

Meanwhile: I don't blame them. Every game company does it.
IS DIS the asian peter molyneux?
Bronysith: yes
sagas[A]: probably
Does this guy exhibit ANY emotions?
CriticKitten: I really hate the industry.
00,10nah they would never alow that on there network sagas[A]
sagas[A]: you can add images to the sd card, so it's possible in theory
Lasharus: Emotions distract him from his cue cards.
Lasharus: Give him a Wii Fit board and you'll see it.

Black 2 and white 2 are sequels to Black and White? Stone me.
00,10yeah you could send it via other networks but not nintendos

Nintendo have to keep in mind their pacing, making sure the money is correctly facing.
REALLY?
To be fair?

it's okay, there'll be more dictators.

You cant ignore Oak's girth. Also, he forgets his grandson's name
hid body is ready
Rainbow: Congratulations for catching the joke.
Sumica: /)
Why can't they make a Pokemon game with its combat based on the show?
...are you just... playing this... again.?
Thank you.
But he is reliable. He comes as soon as you defeat the elite four
All right
game time...
That element of character creation needs to be reimagined.
But will you remember them all?
SuperBrony64: You're a hired hitman for Nintendo aren't you? :P

WHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA???
This game is made for me
/me 's moustache ignites Bronysith on contact.
11,02And all those games I have on my Wii practically ._.
/me hugs Bronysith
Vordox: Can a redundant redundancy?
hm?
Vordox: How about a female man?
Meanwhile: Errr...what?
SuperBrony64: game time?
I wonder if Nintendo ever thought of porting the Virtual Boy games to the 3DS
Rainbow: A female man....doesn't exist..?
/me needs batteries for wii controls
Vordox: I am no "man". WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?
Has anything changed in 8 years in this chat room that I should be aware of?
SuperBrony64, as a rabid fan of Kirby I simply do not care, I NEED THIS for collectiong
CriticKitten: Oh...Okay you win.
/me dons appropriate sunglasses.
CriticKitten: The queen of Rohan/

10Impossible to compare since none of us were around 8 years ago.
Vordox: How do YOU know?
Articuno got married
00,10and you will buy them all again cause it's a package and you want the extra fetures SuperBrony64

Vordox: Oh, I'm male. Just not a man. Kitten, remember? :D You shouldn't have said both.
00,10so normal day in london
I see that nickname thieving (which is where my original name "Articuno2" comes from) is still forbidden. Good thing, actually.
Right, I think I've spit enough bile for one day, I should probably go to bed before I actually offend someone.
hmm rechargables
11,02This game, you only have one life with each survivor, once he dies, you play a new survivor who has to go through the entire level again and even have to fight your old self.
CriticKitten: I'm confused about you now. ._.
Celestia Save the Princess
Anypony that lives in the UK knows this song

SuperBrony64 thats what i like about the premise
O_O
OH SAVE US CELESTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
G'night all! :)
long live our do you have to fight all of your old selves?
SuperBrony64: are you sure it's just the level? It would make more sense if you have to go through the whole game with a new character.
ded
bye GilDash
Night GilDash
11,02When you're scanning the environment or looking at something in your inventory (i.e. the Wii U GamePad screen), the game still happens around you so you're at risk if a zombie comes up to you.
The queen is the final boss
I like the look of this game, then I realise it's for Wii U.
Lame.
/me would actually like to see those chat logs.
I like the old theme. It was sad and Tobuscus made a literal of it.
ZombiUUUUUUUUUUU
11,02Kandarihu: Well...if you had one life the entire game...that would suck :I
that soldier went down like a boss!
00,10lolwut, a baonett on an m4?

At least it's a new IP.
Paper mario
SB64, who wouldn't you just cut off your own head when you know that Your dead so that you don't come back as zombie
And back to sequelage.
*covered my eyes when it zoomed in on him
10k? Why would you think I'd have them?
SuperBrony64, You had oly one life in Comixzone
00,10yeah it can Irish_Pony, but a better use of the under rail would be an m203
and gosh that game was awesome
oh hey its the zelda ripp off sequel
The zombie said HUUURRRRP
This game is supposed to be scary, right? Save files are a safety net. Take that away and ramp up the difficulty and you'd have a justifiably scared player.
wuut is this...?
I don't.
mecha
Darksiders 2! YUS. I'm looking forward to this game.
Well, this looks interesting.
00,10if they call it invincable how come I can see it?
Wait, Darksiders 2?
Oh.
I saw this in School
Bored now.
Meanwhile: zelda, prince of persia ripoff

hi Custard
Sumica: that would be more for the M16 since its more accurate :P
So where is GamepLay?
Well that's hilarious.
I'm just saying that there are some people on this site who have been here as long as me.
Hi CCCP :)
DESTRUCTION AND MAYHEM MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA
Wow. I hope we get to do that in gameplay.
10Search may help you find what you need
11,02Oh look...Shadow of the Collusus

The first time i saw The original Dead island tralier was in History class

SuperBrony64: with trace amounts of color
SuperBrony64: GoW, Castlevvania LoS, Raziel...yada yada yada
11,02In Technicolor :3
I'll try. But my memory from when I was 8 is very vague in terms of random chats I had on the internet. xD
00,10did you just refer to accicray being an issues with an m203?
This is not Shadow of The Colossus.
JUST LIKE WITH YOUR MOM LAST NIGHT
is this a shadow of the colossos sequel?
SuperBrony64: did you just copy my post ^^
SuperBrony64: Guess what, RAZIEL still kicks this guys arse.
00,10You know the m203 is a grenade attachment yes Irish_Pony?
how old ate these "latest peas"?
*are

god of war, zelda, prince of persia, and portal rip off
11,02TrixieBaconMuffin: No ;~;
i get the feeling they're a few months old
What is wub?
so you play as death in this game
10Yes
-.-
Rainbow: They get you kicked?
Rainbow: they are both not trees
Sumica: dah, M16 + ACOG + M203 = One Man Army :P
Pro-tip: If you have to name more than three games to state what it's a "rip-off" of, it's probably not that much of a rip-off.
11,02Who wants to see an annoying "gamer"?
Irish_Pony: You played too much COD
or worse
yes
10Aurora admitted to forgetting about them
Vordox: Nope
00,10so how much rope should I give Rainbow?
SuperBrony64: We can see you already.
SuperBrony64: thats me
Dohoho
SuperBrony64: so every gamer?
CriticKitten: Pretty much that, yeah.
Since original IPs are stupidly hard to come by, and unique gameplay even moreso.
SuperBrony64: yes
11,02:<
SuperBrony64: yes
Meanwhile: silly its me
CCCP: They both come wet and fierce, and when they leave, they take all of your stuff.
SuperBrony64: can we see How to annoy?
/me hugs SuperBrony64.
... I don't remember what my nickname was on this site before Articuno2, but it's possible that I was using "Tharthandorf" or some variation.

I have instant dislike of this girl.
SaxyPretender: Of course she is. She attracts dem male gamers...
00,10Reminds me of that chick from Xplay back when she got the job
HOW IS SHE HOLDING IT?!
YEAH PULL THAT ARROW ISN'T IT SO STIFF?
woman game reporters make me think of AMAZEBALLS
She says "a bunch" when there are only 4.
Yeah, tell us HOW much of a gamer you are
She's got a lot of these guys coming at her.
OH MY GOSH
OH NO
Jesus woman, shut up and play.
SHE CAN DO GOOD HAND WORK
Show us the game, we don't like you at all.
wariobot

CASUALITY
LOL
Oh man
Casual
Can we have her run over now?
Overly excited, breaking fourth wall
so about darkstalkers one you played as war and in darkstalkers 2 it seems you play as death does this mean its going to be a 4 part series one game for each horseman
what the hell is it anyway
thats like a "shoot arrow here" sign -.-
I'M Back..................
This is how you can tell the difference between a normal gamer and someone trying to act like one.
I think I remember someone with a "Spectra the Rijolt", and some person who tried to wile his way through my name snatching shenanigans back then. Aside from that, I have no clue.
MIB 3 was AWESOME!
Wb Dark92Enigma
Haha, yeah, that over-the-shoulder-smile-at-the-camera was SO natural and spontaneuous

"Seamlessly"
Yeah, I have my doubts too :P
So there's actually a new console as well, not just a gamepad ?
More money i guess ...
There goes my bowel control...........there's the joke
TAP ALL OVER DAT SCREEN
00,10well they are chargeing 200 for the 3ds XL
Nittany: No, they'd have to call it the "Wii ON U" to deserve a urine joke
screw you dad
I guess the only person I can know for sure has my chat logs from when I was 8, would be Articuno. I guess I'll ask for them when I have the chance.
Urine trouble
Just nintendo? :P
FUCKING BUBBLES!
Can i see your Wii U

11,01Trouble with your Wii?
11,01:p
i just realized that the control sticks are on the top...
so about darkstalkers one you played as war and in darkstalkers 2 it seems you play as death does this mean its going to be a 4 part series one game for each horseman

Alright, I'll do that. Thanks.
00,10somg such mastery of the indistry standard controller setup of the last 15 years
omg ITS A FCUKING CONTROLLER WE GET IT
"Comfortably"
are the trigger analog or digital?
Did they record this on moonbase alpha?
Why on earth are they advertising every single aspect to this thing that we all already know about?
Woop de doo, you made a controller with a screen in it.
PULL DEM SHOULDER BUTTONS
FUCK THAT SHIT, This kid has BUBBLES!
FUCKING BUBBLES!
P.S. They certainly wouldn't be anywhere on this modern version of the site, as the whole site was done over a few years back. I even had to re-register in 2006 :(
how are control sticks n the top a good idea
why is headphone jack on top?
OH MY LUNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ITS A GIANT DS we fucking get it

Perfect for taking control of the TV when it is in use
00,10hope they have a lock on those
NOW TELL ME HOW TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN DUMB AD!
Right, enough bile spewing, this is idiotic to an extreme. I'm going to bed.
This sounds like a kindergaten lesson.
Gyroscope you say?

11,02"Standard since the Nintendo 64"? You had to buy a Rumble pack for that...
"Standard"
11,01It would be worse if you hit the power button by accident.
Rumble + Motion sensitive. This will end well...
rumble + creativity of developers ? ... hmhmmmmmmmmm
Meanwhile: Not their job to be creative with the tech, that's the game developer's job.
Standard since the Gamecube... for Nintendo
Even more important?????
seems legit
weeee jew
I want my peace when playing a game

I remember having a Gamecube... it was fun.

Meanwhile: Well we haven't seen that many games. What I've seen, though, was pretty decent.
streaming ads :D
00,10yes the option to buy the rummble pack is standard now SuperBrony64

SuperBrony64: Inorite?!?!

00,10or better yet it comes standard with dead pixkes just like the gamegears that they retooled to make those things

japanese soda tastes wierd

AJIsAwesome: They got that back in Project M, and L cancel, Dash Dancing...EVERYTHING from Melee is back ALL OF IT <3 AND they changed the balance all over the place.
Vordox: If your going to main Mewtwo, i suggest watching vids of Taj for inspiration
0,14I respect the Smash scene (when they don't have their heads up their butts about some things) for being hype about their game
Taunt
It's not even supposed to be a competitive game. That line of thinking is precisely why they're screwing up the formula with the new one: to cater to you crazies who want SSB to be a Street Fighter or Tekken instead of a fun party game >_>
XD
lol
And I!!!!!!!! WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU!!!!

10'Parts of accounts'?
SaxyPretender: smash is about SMASHING your controller
Saxy: But the whole reason they're making the change is because people bitched that Brawl wasn't "competitive" like Melee was.

New Smash is by new developer

SaxyPretender: Imo that would be very hard, the only thing i could see as improvement is new characters
13what kind of shot
13:3c
Junh LOL!!
0,14that's why there's so many mods that replicate Melee gameplay
@Skylands My whole account wasn't disabled, but that portion was.

@Skylands Yes.

Why so much hate for Brawl :(
Pew pew pew pew

10Huh? Do you have a screenshot of it?
I respect Project M, but nothing beats Melee
Reikim: I love Brawl.
well, it would actually be nice to be in bed with someone else because it's quite cold atm
0,14limiting it to two player only? that's a bad move
(winter)
Reikim: It's a bad competative game
pew pew pew pewdiepie
LOL
well
Wait...Brawl was meant to be competitive now? *is blown away*
LA LA LA
we're driving home now
Vordox: Then play Street Fighter? SSB isn't a competitive game. >_>
SaxyPretender: part of the appeal of smash is 4 people murdering eachother at once right?
Games without meta = No chance to become big or classics.
from the portair?
STREET FIGHTER HAS NEVER BEEN COMPETATIVE
From what game is Ike?
I shall finish Madoka if my DVD player doesn't die
0,14...
Urgh, headache...
I agree saxy. I really enjoy 2v2 and ffa just for fun
Vordox: so wrong
and then we can discuss sexytime later
/me runs
0,14Street Fighter IS competative
@Skylands No, because it went away once I redid EVERYTHING in my profile. It wasn't a ban, either, so I'm a tad confused.
SaxyPretender: Which version? Since...err...Ex2?
0,14I run a fighting game club, i should know =P
Vordox: Poongoo
He beat Diago
Lol
well, in 8 years, stuff has happened to the site
so what now?
SaxyPretender: So how many Tournaments, INTERNATIONAL, have you played in? :P
HE PERFECTED HIS LAST ROUND
so much hype
I really hate the nonsense that SSB has to be designed to be competitive, instead of just, ya know, a fun game to goof off a few hours in.
maybe your awards got deleted due to corrupted DB or something
Saxy, you just broke the first rule of fighting game club
Vordox: Funny thing, that. I assume you're talking about multiplayer fighters, because otherwise I'd point to Metroid, Legend of Zelda, etc...anyway, you don't need meta to become a classic.
0,14SF4, while not being my favorite SF game, is pretty freaking food
0,14*good
Reikim: THey have Meta games
Pretty freaking food.
lol
10I see your award
/me remembers super mario sunshine
I like AE
i just do
@Skylands It works now.
Vordox: Meta only exists if there is multiplayer competition.
SaxyPretender: And then I bring up the data of characters winning and losing
Reikim: Wrong
Lawl
Ive got Pc version
Reikim: Speed runs Mario 64, andd other games.
Because it's that same strand of broken logic that is producing a 2 player SSB. You "competitive" folks are getting your wish, so why aren't you happy? SSB will be "competitive", just like you wanted. >_>
just killed an assist trophy
ssf4 ae
Vordox: That counts as meta? Wow. Learn something new every day, I guess.
CriticKitten: We liked Melee for it's Meta and competativeness.
Reikim: Meta is bringing out the very end of the game.
Metaknight? HELL NAW

Oh!
I never got to play competitive Melee, so I never experienced the meta. *shrugs* I just enjoyed beating up my friends.
Really?
CriticKitten: True, but it didn't have stupid stuff(Tripping)
He got banned from tourny play after Apex 2012
Throw a bunch of Nintendo characters in a game and let them kick each other's asses. It's not supposed to be a competitive fighter title.
10Yes
SaxyPretender: New comers Meta. :P
CriticKitten: Yet Melee became a big hit for it's competativeness?
Yes
yes it does
Its HUGE
CriticKitten: You know what's not meant to be competetive? Staring contests. But there are world championships for that as well.
11,01Go Derpy_Hooves!
Vordox: By your logic, I guess Brawl wasn't popular then.
O WAIT
gg
0,14actually, long time runner from freaking Dustloop were saying that
11,02gg :3
So yeah, inb4 bronies develop a massively convoluted meta for Fighting is Magic. Not that I'm complaining.
It outsold Melee didn't it?
noooo
@Skylands Anyway, there was a Lugia that came before the Lugia that is called Lugia on this site, and he basically destroyed everything. That's why around 4-5 years ago, I had to re-register.

Nittany_Discord: It's a good game, and very popular.
@Skylands Does he still visit this site?
Vordox: I'm pretty sure Brawl outsold Melee and has higher ratings. Your argument is invalid.
For me this game got old fast =/
10Not that I'm aware of
still, this game is epic
Melee was better
CriticKitten: Oh, he's going to tear that argument apart...

CriticKitten: Sales figures actually tend to enrage them further, because of this stigmata that "If it's Popular, it Sucks"
Lol
KREENG
Vordox: I suppose that depends who you ask. But that's sort of besides the point, isn't it? You said the title wasn't popular, and sales figures are the best way to measure that.
CriticKitten: Is Wii Fit the best controller ever, is Super Mario Bros 3 the best game ever? Is PSX the best console ever, is ....you see wher eI am going? Outsold has nothing to do with Quality of the game. NEVER mix those up, EVER
CriticKitten: See what I mean?
Vordox: You're the one confusing the two.
to the left of me is a bible
Big gay starstorm
CriticKitten: No, I have an eye for quality, not for quantity
can I preach the word of god to protect myself?
Vordox: You said "popular". Popularity is directly related to sales.
so close
I'd rather have a great arse game foor 10 hours, then a weak game for 100 hours.
to the left of me is my phone, hmmm...
Brawl outsold Melee, ergo it was more popular.
CriticKitten: Popular based on it's endurance of time
Well, you're right Skylands, a lot has changed in 8 years.
CriticKitten: Thereby connected to the quality of the gameplay.
To the left of me is either my cellphone, or my teacup
Vordox: That's not even a thing.
SuperBrony64: do the giant jigglypuff glitch :3
CriticKitten: not competetively though.
CriticKitten: Although I do in fact agree on certain points. There are some crap games that have sold very well. On the other hand, popularity does not equal quality, which should have been the logical coutnerargument.
I played Melee almost every day in the cafeteria at college
Why are people arguing about brawl and melee?
FaithHeart: <3 Who didn't.
00,10So basicly the only people safe is the guy with one of those plushies.
Reikim: If he had said "quality" I'd have been fine. He said "popularity".
:P
I was obsessed
00,10You know the one i meen
and I kicked ass at playing Peach
!skylands
well, technically Daisy
oshi
11,01He hides in the slot.
10!rukario
/me now belongs to Skylands for 9 minutes
So tough shit, he's wrong. Brawl WAS more popular by virtue of sales. Its quality as a game is another story.
@ Tharthan no he does not
noo oD:
!nick
User error: Access denied.
Sumica: which plushie? the brony fanbase is both scary and cool
oo
Use the right terms when arguing from a fan perspective. :p
you are denied to me!
Sumica: Not that plushie!
00,10the scarry ones
I am invincible
10You are Heavy
CriticKitten: IT WAS POPULAR BECASE OF MELEE
XD
Can we stop arguing Brawl and Melee? :( I love both those games and I'd hate to be forced to choose...
Sumica: well theres apparently two plushies now :'(
You're counterarguing yourself in the SAME sentance, CriticKitten ...
Da
00,10yes I know
Haha
Reikim: I wouldn't bother to choose. They're both good games.
VZZZZZT DADADADADAA BRRRRRR
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Vordox: No, you're contradicting yourself. You said Brawl wasn't as popular, which is wrong.
Nice counter
11,01Sales = popularity? Not really. People might like it /then/, but hate it afterwards.
i liek SB streamz :3
darn
gg
11,02gg :)
Nittany_Discord: ^
@Nick Have you been here for 8 years as well?
11,02PartyCannon :D
XD
was trying to use star storm :3
Lol
CriticKitten: Melee lasted for...well still, brawl was turned down within the first 2 year.
Mr. gayman watch
do giant jigglypuff glitch :3
Nittany: And that's what ratings are for. :p
CriticKitten: Check Super Smash scenes, those who play the game till even today
not that long :P but I have been here for five
what is mr game and watch from
11,01Ratings aren't too trustworthy now.
but yeah I do know who that guy you mean is
Vordox: You're arguing a pointless point.
Nittany_Discord: take all my ^'s
CriticKitten: True, it is.
I think I joined here in 2007 it was
@Nick It stunk when he did that, man.
alexxm Game and Watch games
alexxm: some of nintendos very frst games. Like early 80's
sqoitle
thanks Celes_Chere
CriticKitten: But I am not backing down on this, cause I know I'm right, I own both brawl and Melee, and I still see people talking about Brawl being a good game, yeah it IS a good game, but nothing compared to what it's based on from Melee, which caused Brawl to become what it is today.
IVYSAUR
thats a big "map" for Smash bros...
11,01I'd go with user reviews really (not metacritic bombings). Avoid major names since they could be padded reviews.
History, Analyze the fanbase, the forums ALL of it and see for yourself.
someone go pet the kitty
Vordox: Whether you liked Melee or Brawl is really irrelevant. The point I'm making is that it's folks like yourself, ranting about how "uncompetitive" Brawl was, that produced this new game in which the game is a 2-player competitive title.
yeah well thats long in the past now
Fun fact, your argument is pointless.
This makes me want to play Earthbound so bad :3
@Nick He blanked the whole goshdarn page and replaced it with something that I don't remember.
So you're getting exactly what you asked for.
this was a bad decision on my part :3
At the cost of the party-based nature of the game.
CriticKitten: No, then it would be Melee.
@Nick Yep. Just trying to be on a clean slate, since there was one fellow who did remember me.
Vordox: Brawl would be Melee if Melee hadnt came out in the first place.
11,01Ugh.
/me shudders
11,01Arguing during a stream.
^
lol charizard cant even fly
I'm having fun with some bots
Okay, have we finished?
Nittany: SB's winning, nothing to cheer for.
:P
Too bad my Wii is poop
I'm rather annoyed right now that I don't have a working Brawl disc...
i would be playing on stream
i hate chat derps 6_9
Vordox: No, what you asked for is a game that's more like Melee. So you're getting that.
I never did like the stamina mechanic. It kinda makes you lose flexibility (Charizard getting tired, so you /have/ to switch to squirtle)
ask Phase4 though, he knows exactly how good i am :3
You wanted a competitive title. Now you're getting one. So what's wrong?
suddenlyt
suddenly'
this was my worst game yet x3
So, are there any big changes to the chat system that I should be aware of?
Oh god we're still arguing
Derptopus.
xD
lol SB
MFW Phase4.
Reikim: Were we arguing? I'm sorry....
Togepi!
ohai DashWithRainbows
CriticKitten: How the buck do you get MELEE; 4 PLAYER FAMOUS Team Coop gaming competativeness, INTO a 2p 1v1 SCENARIO with the basis of Brawl into a competative Meta game tournament, YOU JUST DON'T WE had the game, WE WANT it bacl....
Phase4: ty ^_^
Ohai tech boy 4.
I wouldn't know not compared to back then D:
Vordox: You're getting exactly what you asked for: a competitive fighter
Step 4.... I dunno, muffins or something?
CriticKitten: No we are not.
gayyyyuuuuu
The four player part just "reduces the competitiveness", you see.
^
The rules were: no spamming, no name stealing and (I think) no unnecessary pinging.
CHARIZARD, WHY CAN'T YOU FLY?
Since it's a competitive fighter and not a party game, right?
gg
11,02gg :)
Hi Masterboss43
Brawl is competetive. Very competetive, in fact, almost as competetive as Melee, but the hype is not even close
hey MasterBoss43 hows your day been
So it should obviously be just two players to make sure it's competitive.
Hello MasterBoss43
FaithHeart: you fool Charizard is a dragon he cant fly... wait a minute
LOL
XD
alexxm Good actually. :)
that ended terribly x3
so why does he have wins?
lol charizard clapping
if he can't fly?
CriticKitten: I give up, this is pointless, we won't back down, Your knowledge versus my knowledge, this is just getting me a headache on a high level.
FaithHeart: Swag

So...is stream dead?
There was one that got me. They had a prison on the moon. The prison was named after LUNA! :O
Reikim: yes
Vordox: ?
Reikim: Chat derped, what said in PM?
`\(°.o)/´
no one here?
rio: we're here
rio: Where here :P
Jun gained a level
Ponies47 the moon has been associted with the name luna for centuries
so they streaming ?
Jun is now level XF!
Ponies47 Haha, that prison you mean. I still get nightmares from the villians tounge :P
anyone ping me?
if so, I missed it
alexxm: So has it. Guess so.
MasterBoss43: That was nasty. :s
Vordox: tl;dr allcaps is not the mark of good argumentation and is the equivalent of yelling louder than the other guy to prove you're right. Something I've tried to teach a lot of people - both IRL and on the Internet - to little success.
/me believes junh1024-XEF would like to learn fissure, but already has four moves. Would you like to delete a move to make room for Fissure?
anyone get a chance to play fighting is magic at bronycon?
Ponies47 Yes..... It will always freak me out.
What moves do I have?
rio: ...they have a demo?
MasterBoss43: Yeah. :s
Reikim: Emphasis exist for a reason.
i heard it will be at the next one
Reikim: Or that word wouldn't exist. :P
0,14haven't heard anything about that, rio
Ponies47: But i am used to watch horor movies so it freaks me out but not that MUCH.....
/me believes junh1024-XEF has: Splash, hydro pump, water pulse, and curse.
Vordox: That's not emphasis. That is egregious and blatant use of force in place of logic.
10Splash
and i have been thinking what if we did something like the MJ dances but instead get the SMILE SMILE song to play a times square new york XD
M_BISON_YES
But anyways. Men in Black 3 was good and you should see it. :)
nonono
detel curse
Reikim: egregious?+
all the other ones are VERY USEFUL
Yes! Tip : Get alot of popcorn, says future guy.
including splash
10Jun, you're doing it wrong
no
MasterBoss43: I've only watch a few. But yeah that was just gross *shivers*
you're doing it wrong

WHUDDA WE WATCHIN =3=
rio: NICE!

Gawd is this argument still going on.

10No
DerpyIsQueen: buffering wheel.
If the new Smash Bros has just ONE thing, I will forgive it of all of its sins, no matter how bad they are.
Lol
DerpyIsQueen: THE BUFFER SHOW! :)
It must have....
Midna.
Vordox: Flagrantly obvious, overused and all-around bad. True emphasis comes from the use of appropriate terms and organization of sentences, exactly as I did there.
Ponies47: i would kill you if i didnt value my own life lol
ZOMZ I LOVE DAT SHOW XD
DerpyIsQueen: Where watching a black screen, just like 100 black people i mean..... (I am not racist)
YES!
YESH!
That Buffer is getting it on with that Loading Bar's girlfriend... OH DA DRAMA
You hear me, Namco Bandai?
/me zoomface
still trying to get a an automatic ice cream maker though :'(
It is men in black we are watching XD
Bronysith: Why? :P
ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM
Oooooh!
MASHDA
CriticKitten: They made Dark Souls... they know wth they doing
MasterBoss43: Yeah, extreme close up edition.
/me hugs rio
If Midna is a playable character in SSB U, I don't care what you do to the game.
Ponies47: it was a quote from mib3
10wat
I will buy it.
Alright
Vordox: Allcaps is not the only way to add vigour to your words. If you're writing well, then emphasis should come naturally to the sentence, as read in the reader's mind.
Instead of granting +1 internet for lulz quotes, I believe one should grant experience points equal to or lesser than that quote.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Gonna chip in here and say Dark Souls sucks.
Bronysith: Oh. You saw it to?
Meanwhile: no it doesnt
Ponies47: it was good. boris the animal was hiloarious
Vordox: There's a reason why the majority of writers do not abuse the capslock key, and those that do are frowned upon as amateurs.
Okay, here
Typing all of it out,though... -_-
Meanwhile At Ponies47: Yo get mah suit.
http://www.mazda.co.nz/why-zoom-zoom
No, I'm serious. I will forgive the sin of it being 2-player only. I'll forgive any sin it commits....if I get a playable roster with Midna on it.
XD if you get it, used ur both names
:D
11,02MasterBoss43: A letter? O.O
Bronysith: IT'S JUST BORIS! But yeah it was good :)
Databse facts points that Brawl had a big fallout of their fanbase over the last few months, mostly being dropped within the full gaming scene with competative in focus, and mostly is a casual game that has no big reward for fighting games, Melee however still stand tough today in the most scenes, that I travel to atleast, and even have big tournaments, solo as well as team based combats.
/me pokes everypony
CriticKitten: My god yes. Also, a 2-player Smash Bros? On which concole?
That emphasis?
TEXT WAAAAAALLL
so anypony see the post on equestria daily about being able to make a song with the offical song composer
Why? Because Midna is the best fricking pony.

Okay, here's the story: A buffer whell decided to take a stop to the ever black forest. He decided to enter the evernight forest because his girlfriend was cheating on TV static. The end.
Vordox: Link, references, and citation or it didn't happen.
Reikim: Supposed the Wii U version they're making is 2-player only.
*Moopy has joined chat* hey guys i have calmed down with my parents
11,01Did SuperBrony64 get the letter J?
Hey xxMoopyxx good. :)

Nittany_Discord: =/
Nittany_Discord Yeah, from me. 6_9
Reikim: And I will forgive that sin, ghastly though it is, for Midna.
/me falls over
xxMoopyxx: Just got back from seeing Men in Black 3 :)
Reikim: Smash Boards, international gaming scenes and stuff? Really?
CriticKitten: ...Nah, I can't support that. I mean, there's already option for two-player battles, and tag-team battles add another layer to strategy. Even for Midna (whom I love) cannot make up for that.
Vordox: No references, not truth.
anypony wanna help me with spreading love and TOLERENCE TO THE XBOX LIVE COMMUNITY PINKIE STYLE :O
/me crawls after Meanwhile
I will still buy it if I can has Midna.
rio: Sorry. I have PS3 :p
Midna is the closest thing I'll get to a waifu. :p
Reikim: YOu don't see me picking up a dictionary for your explanation of words, right?
first game im spreading love to is MW3
Vordox: You should have.
LOL, nice rio
starting out dangerious
Vordox: Besides, the situations are not comparable.
08,01CriticKitten is mai waifu
rio: Good luck! :)
rio: good for you... keep it away from Halo tho
Reikim: Urgh, do I have to...I'd rather trust a person then trust the internet itself.
Well I got nothing to say, so goodnight everypony.
11,01rio: You mean troll and annoy them?
After that I vote we spread love to GTA.
Bonus points if Midna plays like Oichi from Sengoku Basara, with shadowy hand attacks.
11,01That's not loving and tolerating them.
Heh men in black i've seen that befor
And not sex love -_-
Vordox: Hearsay is rarely accepted in law or science.
trololololololol
no play songs and anyone who sends me hateful messages just respond in a nice calm and repectful manner
Night everypony.
08,01sex?
/me hides in a tree.
11,01Play songs to annoy them?
Nittany_Discord: to be a true troll on MW3 is be on PC and play MLP theme song all the time during matches
what did i miss?
So yeah. I've crafted genius here.
Night ZappyTheUnicorn :)
Vordox: You..have learned proper Internet research techniques, yes?
11,01That's not loving and tolerating.
Midna, with a moveset straight out of Sengoku Basara. :|
08,01what are you fokls watching?
Haha, Reik...
08,01RustyMeat: you're the one with rusty meat
are you saying that your a dirty clopper?
Don't bring up law
Or rules, or justice.

OK then got any clue how else we can spread love and kindness to them?

Ow!
You know, if Namco is making SSB Wii U....they could share some of THEIR cast of characters for the title too....

Is the chat room usually so quiet these days?
Reikim: I know what I know, that's my world.

i already did it with black ops with my other brony friends any msg i got i responded with love and tolerence here one for exp *U SUCK MY ^&$^ YOU NEED TO GROW UP YOU LITTLE $^$#@ AND STOP WATCHING MY LITTLE GAYONY
Vordox: I'm not waving away your point, not at all. I just refuse to take it as fact until I have my own information. I do respect that you likely have more experience than I at actual competitive gaming. And now is probably the best (and safest) time to break this apart and move on.
SaxyPretender: Bandai and Namco own a LOT of characters too.
it's pretty much either quiet or the opposite, not much inbetween :P

/me jumps over it
SaxyPretender: But then it would be a Soul Calibur game...

Na na na na Naaa naaaa
It'll be a day one buy.
/me hand runs after Juliet.
not exactly everyone on call of duty one for PC accepted it
I see... the chat room back in the day was like New York on a Sunday; though I live in Rhode Island, so I can't be certain.
CriticKitten: Which Midna? Adult!Midna, or Imp!Midna?
hey did you guys see the pinkie pie licous?
yes
/me takes off running
Im going to do that sing the call of
oops
i herd she was huffing and puffing in the background
I wonder...
/me cart wheels into Juliet's back with his leg stumps.
xxMoopyxx: Yeah, she does.
:p
also any time i got the song SMILE SMILE one time everyone in a SEARCH and DESTROY EVERYONE SANG WITH IT
Reikim: My ideal model for a Midna character is a Zelda-esque character. Imp form uses shadowy hand attacks, or transform into the twilight princess and have shadow magic opposite of Zelda.
Huh? It didn't work.
then she moved the camera
I'm in <censored>
I mean Virginia
XD
Use her hand to throw around shit
CriticKitten: That would be nice. Still, I remain resolute: if they removed four-player support, I would refuse to buy the game.
/me is knocked flat on her face and loses her grip Meanwhile's legs
Or I suppose you could do a transformation during Final Smash, like with Samus.
Hairhand is best hair
Annnnnd my computer froze. But anyways. YOU SILLY FILLIES! I'M NOT GOING TO BED :D
Either or. Both models work for me.
/me watches as they fly towards the cliff edge
so what would happen if hasbro made an official fighinting game with all their IP'S?
hey sumica whats up man
It's only 7:27 PM :p
Reikim: I dunno if I'd buy or not, in all seriousness. If it lacks four players, it's a lot less fun.
So is the stream ever gonna come back up?
Reikim: Especially since you could easily do a five player game. Gamepad plus four Wiimotes. >_>
SpeedyBolt: Well duh :)
00,10Very little atm
ponies47 you forget that everpony is some where else around the world
11,01Ahh! It's water!

Hell, I'd like MORE players rather than less.
Oh ok :$
Hey ponies47
rio: True but it's only 7:28 were I live :P
Gamepad, and then either Wiimote or 3DS connected play. Up to 8 players.

The Wii U theoretically can support that many Wiimotes IIRC, and the 3DS is getting a connected play function with the Wii U title, so....why not go for TONS of players instead of two?

mah mom just found a kitten and brought it home, it's nothing but bones and hasn't eaten yet:S
so anypony gonna get ZombiU :|
CriticKitten: I think there's an upper limit at some point. Maybe six.
You know when I was at the movies I was gonna go into the lobby and walk around and say I WATCH MY LITTLE PONY! I'M A BRONY AND PROUD! Or just sing the MLP theme song outloud. I never got the chance :(

Reikim: But assuming it's six, two gamepads and six Wiimotes (or one Wiimote swapped out for a 3DS). 8 players.
so do you guys think the playstation smash bros will be good
CriticKitten: I mean, an upper limit on how many are actually feasible in a game like that.
ponies47 i have a plan after bronycon after they all leave hack the montier in times square to play SMILE SMILE and well everyone do the HOKIE PONY
But my mom was organized my bedroom and she freakin organized stuff around my computer stuff
I think I've just struck genius.
alexxm: meh
I wonder what would have happened if I left my session from 8 years ago open until now...
Nittany_Discord: Meh. I'm very random. :P
/me ponders.
rio: LOL! :D
and now it looks all straight in here in my bedroom
/me idly grabs Juliet's arm in his sleep.
why does it keep telling me i need a program to run a stream?
rio: you just might get tazed because of it
xxMoopyxx: I like clean rooms. I cleaned mine a few weeks ago and it looks nice :)
xxMoopy mess it up
11,01My brain needs food.
11,01It is shutting down on me.
xxMoopyxx mess it up
shut up i didn't mess up my rom it looked dirty
Nittany_Discord: EAT A BAGEL.
Nittany_Discord: Quick! Get some food! :d
Meanwhile: O_O
i mean room
i know also it would be considerd an act of terrism and probly go above fedrial offence
Meanwhile: LIKE A BOSS!
sorry xxMoopy
Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston
Reikim: I suppose, but I still support 8-player SSB.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: What.
CriticKitten: That might just BARELY be workable...I still think the upper limit is six, though.
xxMoopyxx: Ah I see. Sorry :s
In terms of code or playability?
so anypony wanna guess the ep for season 3 when the CTC get thier cutie marks?
rio: meh
rio: THEY NEVER WILL! MUHAHAHAHA!
The Wii U should be able to support that many, so it comes down to the playability for me. And I think you can make eight player brawls work.
well thats just uncalled for :'(
But heres a another thing my mom just figured out that i wiped my boogers all over the bean bag and they said if they see 1 more booger on there there going to kick me out of the house if i don't listen to there house rules god dang it
xxMoopyxx: wth
rio: I'm sorry. I was joking. They will get there cutie marks sometime :(

Nittany_Discord: It wafts through the air lazily, drifting on air currents like it has no care...
Reikim: Oh well, I'd still be happy with six as well.

Anything's better than two.
SaxyPretender: Is there anything wrong with saying hi? :(
CriticKitten: Agreed.

02yep
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Lol:P
from my play through of 1/3 of the quantum conundrum, i've discovered that its a little fidgity, jump is strange, and needs a little work. but the puzzles are portal quality and even the fidgity ones feel great to solve
The proper spelling is kumquat. In other words, it's almost as silly to spell as to say.
(Rimshot)
:D
Lol!!! :D

MasterBoss43: Yummy! :d
03it's made digitally
Wait, what?
not really
LOGICAL steps to the conclusion!
:D
03so digital -> digital would be basically what it should be
What the hell.....
this seems legit
03not digital -> analog -> digital...
he developed a human!
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m62xj9Tnhj1qj26eao1_400.gif this is hilarious

lots of audiophiles believe analog records sound better than CDs
That is amazing~
Ponies47 *Gives a glass of juice to Ponies47*
i actually understand all of wha the is saying i might need to be a dective
03yes, but what part of digitally mastered are you missing
Comeone derk! :D
are CDs 24 bit 96 KHz?
03most hip-hop beats are made on a computer.
xD
03SACDs are
/me runs
/me floats idly around.
/me digitally re-masters a video and puts it on VHS
that format died

That made no sense to me. Someone pls explain?
xmasskills: NOt connected to the stream, careful.
He says Pentagon funny.
03it's still around, just not common

Someone please explain this software to me

03kinda like laserdisc :P
03they still made them in Japan for years
Laserdisc actually is dead
Sagas: very very intricate of a solution that defies the very existance of safety causing a conclusion to be made based on logical setps
ELI5 pls...
or something
the last one was pressed in 2002
03well yeah
/me sighs.
Who wouldn't want to be buried at sea?
03because digital is better
worst guy to follow someone

03but people would have said laserdisc was dead in the late 80s too
it is a spy

Bronysith in truth, yes, but it still is pork
Lunar_Brony: but not bacon

skynet not that bad they can be stopped AM cannot
Uhh buffah
rio: it programmed ellens mind for her to be obsessed with sex
i still want to be an emo
Naah buffah.....
Bronysith which is why we call it Canadian Bacon. You could put Canadian inf front of anything and make it different
rio: am toys with everyone. skynet just kills
i thought it made her try to rember the rape she had *spoliers for a game*

sagas[A]: i still want to be an emo
Every day im buffering
Reikim: It's randomly disconnecting. Lag is irrelevant.
flutterchu: why?
Fluttershy+horrbile and grusume medical impossbilities+pikachu= "flutterchu"

.-.

sagas[A]: emo's are mosly lke me i hate freinds and i hate having fun and i want to be the first emo brony on the internet and i actually learn somthing from my little pony

Ghosts. Have you tried giggling?
....why is Harry Potter surprised that ghosts exist?
Dude's met tons of them

Cloud we will love and tolerate, but the mods will kick you out of the chat for disobeying the rules. This is a chat room, after all
wb Ponies47
Alister[S]: So Ive done absolutly nothing productive today :)
Thank you MahBoi777 :)
sagas[A]: Me too !
ITS A TRAP
Haha! Ok, once I find out how to change my name :P
:)
Nittany_Discord: theres this dude who turns game titles into pony game titles, and Im gonna be featured in one of them :)
and ur face is a face
sagas[A] ssounds like my kind of day
Alister[S]: The only thing worth mentioning is that I created a skype account
Love and tolerate is a silly saying.
i just told you how `-`
sagas[A]: add me !
I swear to God, I hate this love and tolerate bullshit
Lunar_Brony: The best kind :)
but ur face will be less of a face when i majke thaat face less of a face
Alister[S]: username?
0,5Love and tolerate is WORST motto
sagas[A]: alizzer96
:D
It really is.
/me glomps LordCelestia
11,01Irish_Pony: Cool. You're going to be in a game.
LordCelestia: No it's not. I like it :)
so what should the motto be?
LordCelestia: what about support our troops?
Nittany_Discord: well the cover of it :P
If it was Prof. Chronotis, I know EXACTLY how he disappeared.
SuperBrony64 why are you always afk
0,5You like the worst motto then Ponies47
Bollocks
rio we are awesome. Deal with it

Lol
LordCelestia: :(
irc n00b

JRP2234: he's probably busy >.>
Oh great xD
What thee buck?
nice
0,5*poker face*
08,01LordCelestia: i think it's a good motto, but not a good rule to live by
11,01Love + Tolerance is cool if not used to excuse actions that aren't involving love and/or tolerating.
08,01as in, i like the spirit of it
11,02Therefore, your argument is invalid :I
Alister[S]: sent it :)
0,5Wrek says no allcaps
Implying anyone agreed to the policy.
sagas[A]: Thanks
12Hi Shiny_Mew =)
ITS A TRAP DOOR YUGI
Hi
sagas[A]: if i even look at them i get suspendid for not staying with them (a kid broke a computer screen once at my school and all he got was a peice of cany) I LETERALLY GET IN TRUBLE FOR STANDING UP TO BULLY'S
Dat kick.
Lunar_Brony: nice, but that'll never catch on
Can we just watch the stream?!

How about love and understanding?
03but it won't power on if I have everything polugged in
:>
/me hugs SB64
03I unplug the DVD drive, it's only using 150W*
The love and tolerate stuff just arose to infuriate the haters who were against MLP fandom in the early days.
/me hugs SuperBrony64
03DVD drives don't use 100W >_>
/me Hugs SuperBrony64
I'm scared!!!!!

0,5Love and tolerate? Nope. Hate and deter.
diddutz1: Where!?!? :O
I can tolerate you, but I will not love. Sorry, I'm straight, no offence.
LordCelestia: seems legit.
LordCelestia: love hate, hate love....
flutterchu: You might want to seek help
LordCelestia: how about...crush kill destroy swag
Love doesn't have to be romantic or sexual, you know.
Ponies47: on stream, the room for the child, on the bed there were mlp blankets
DocSane: I'm taking this conversation as seriously as it seems to merit :D
Car is ded
sagas[A]: how can i seek help when i have to stay with non brony bullies

Cod is the common.
Cloud: Why yes, this is the place to hat bronies. Can I have my hat right now? :3

11,02Cod tastes better than Batteredfish

Y U TECHN00B
Cloud: I want a hat too
08,01so i'm going to stay in scotland
