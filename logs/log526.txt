of is it?
08,01Vordox: really? since when?
/me kicks router
08,01Vordox: i'll need to check up on that
Saturn: It's too graphical for BrS, has been discussed with the other mods.
"What you do this time?"
Saturn, may i speak with you for a second?
11,01Elfen Lied has too much nudity to be shown on here with a normal stream.
Hmmm.
meh
Elfen Lied is too graphic.
Saturn: could you try enabling framedropping? may make it more bearable..
08,01Panda: of course
Saturn: There's stuttering ALOT of it.
08,01shana: nah, it's because my harddrive is failing
sluttering?
08,01it keeps getting read errors
:P
Wasn't the first 5 min of elfen lied rated the most violent intro in anime history.
is this a amv or the opening
Saturn: ooh thought it was slow cpu..
whooooa

Saturn: The sound is skipping frames to catch up with the visuals
ALL OF THEM
Saturn: Now the audio is WAY ahead of the ideo XD
If anyone needs a recap, this: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast?from=Main.EdenOfTheEast Should just about cover everything you need to know.

08,01how about now?
its missile!
What's this anime about?
The frames are skipping and leaving the audio behind again
hey guys
Saturn: Audio way behind and MASSIVE stuttering on the visuals. Whatever you did made it way worse.
Saturn: Might as well go back to watchable like previous episodes.
WAIT

Now it's fixed!
Spy- Pony crush
Saturn: It's fixed!

06Freefall29~ (:
I used to have plans, but then musik stream. Oh well.
dang it! Why did one of the thousand random thoughts that rushed in my mind had to be "I wish I was Luna's socks"
I don't though
WOOT this song
Oh this :D
Or... Pony socks are hawt. Ever though about that? Hmmm?
http://th05.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2012/103/a/c/luna__socks__by_lerauxart-d4w1jp6.png um, of course I do
Whatever you're streaming, I still haven't gotten more than one and a half seconds of it.

i think it's just wmp visualization
Oh boy, my parents are arguing -__-
08,01so i've been reading about UAV drones today
Saturn: fun things
08,01the things they can do with unmanned aircraft now, it's simply amazing
Dis cord
Saturn: how are tehy going to rape us?
Dat cord too
0,14fun fact: UAVs require three kills to call in :3
08,01Bronysith: well, i postulate that in 10 - 20 years, we'll no longer have commercial airline pilots
06ITs not wmp visualization X3
Saturn: and self aware computers, either
0,14touche
Saturn: EITHER AM or skynet...i pray for skynet
Saturn: Would people trust in that though? We might have an airline piolet just for people's faith.
08,01Bronysith: i don't think we'll ever have self-aware computers
Saturn: I honestly hope they're not stupid enough to make planes WITHOUT any manual control in them. I don't wanna leet haxxorz crashing my planes remotely.
Saturn: Would you accept their use by the police?
Saturn: As a tool of law enforcement
Luna's war ftw
08,01and not all flights having them
0,14ikr?
unmanned flight =/= flight
0,14but that means a Top Gun remake in the future won't be culturally relevant
:(
D:
you'd probably choke on a pretzel, though
0,14no, that's bad!
08,01Everlasting_Joy: i think you're wrong there
You think the Mane 6 could ever visit a Japan-like area of Equestria? That would be neat.
08,01look up BigDog
06Everlasting_Joy: (:
08,01but yeah, the military are going to have autonomous "soldier" land drones in 20 - 30 years
not exactly robotics, but there is the HULC exoskeleton too.
There might be a pony anime someday, like how Powerpuffgirls got one
and the TADS system on the apaches.
05Everlasting_Joy: got spotify? putting some of my fav metal songs on a playlsit there that you can sub
:(
08,01Alchemist: yeah, exoskeletons are awesome

ugh, dat buffer :T
11,01If a computer can program itself, then we have a shot at AI.
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/20768/alicorn-butterfly_cutie_mark-crown-dialogue-duo-eq
11,01True AI.
11,01I don't know.
Computers dont have souls
Whats wrong with self awareness?
11,01Create a program the shuts down the machine if it programs itself too fast or too much.
06Computers can never program themselves, because the amount of time it would take for a programmer to programm it to programm itself would be decades, even centuries
Hey everypony
They are deterministic... for now
Finally healed everything
08,01VioletVanilla: we already have self modifying and self adapting programs
11,01Then we're screwed.
The stream is working fine for the most part.
After around a month, my injuries are healed
Woo
Teaching a computer how to program itself to adapt to a situation is more time consuming than just programming it to adapt to that situation in the first place.
*malware
Yeah, the stitching is just about gone
08,01VioletVanilla: programs already exist that right programs, though
08,01*write
Saturn: Do any of them do anything useful? :P
BRB :P
Few stitches need to go, but it feels fine
11,01Does it work well?
^
Yeah
08,01VioletVanilla: yes, but then, when you combine the two concepts, you can have programs that write entirely novel programs
DAT BUFFER
they're planning to have that as an assistant
Vive l'avancement!

today watson... tomorrow terminator style rebellion

Saturn: ^
Not buffering for me this time.

06Saturn: Sorry. .. I mean that ><
/me blushes ^^" Hello everyone!
is that the WMP visualizer?
^_^
06Its not wmp visualizer, its a programme called G-Force
A computer first needs a personality to become self aware.
I finished Zelda OoT Master quest yesterday
/me 13hides in vivi's mane
the goal is self awareness, not imitating humans
I'd like to know where mips.tv is hosted from. Whenever I'm having problems, a speedtest might be very helpful
/me 11,01hides in Shizuka's mane.
/me hides in Very_Silly_Filly's mane
/me is put off by some ponies' thinking.
Dat mane hiding.
'dem selfaware ponies
/me hides in his own mane
First, they need to program AI to not be retarded in some aspects
Not enough processing power for an AI to not seem bumbling trying to comprehend the real world. Its a pointless waste of time and money trying to creat something self aware, its a task beyound us.
I created my first advanced AI recently, and it's still a pain
BREASTS!
Hi everypony!
08,01Rex_Mundi: oh, i don't think it's beyond us, i just think we'll wipe ourselves out before we manage to do it
Saturn: looks like it
08,01Alchemist: the way things are going to go is neural nets on quantum computers
Saturn: At our current rate, we'll kill ourselfs in the next decade
