I was expecting make-up. Wow
show us the nasty side
That was some damn good makeup
They did such a great job with his face.
wait were those bones? how is that even possible
and thats when 2face is bourne xD
He really shouldn't be able to talk with that.

One of the best Twoface designs I've ever seen.
Two Face's design is pretty awesome in this movie.
all dem moneys
nice
Never really liked how clean cut the two faces were in other incarnations
Whee, that looks like fun.
that money pyramid
moneh
All. That. MONEY.
weeeeee
Thats a lot of money
and all that money was spent on dents face

Let's keep that side out of the light.

05,15Also, take into consideration killing a DA's girlfriend is a lot worse than a crazy man in a suit
Get those people out of there they are gonna get blown up.
Wtf?
05,15So it does make sense
i dont care
13it's cute when guys try to figure us out then get all mad when they're wrong
The irony in that comment
Dat theme song.
It's cute when you think you're that complex.
01,11The only thing the public would see is the DA's assistent dating an extremely eccentric and extremely stupid rich man.
damn shifty ladies
:D ^
oh alright
:o
01,11If anything, she'd be SAFER dating him.
That explains everything. :D

Poor Harvey Two Face.

05,15Then you're up a creek

01,11otakon: THEN WHY THE FUCK IS SHE DATING MOB ENEMY #1?!?!
Chaosssss.
I think we figured out that Racheal should dated more normal guys
its fair
05,15Silverscreen because she has the protection of the law and not a billionare in a suit
its beer?
It seems to work in this context.
this such a fun conversation, it's definetally going some where, and not in circles >_>
it's just random
You die
Far Cry 3 isn't even out yet.
this man watched Return of Harmony one too many times.

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: The Lost Tribe
That scene was also accidental improv is there nothing Heath can't do?
that was NOT CGI
They actually blew up a real hospital for this
Two Face escaped.
Good thing he didn't get to the hospital
and rumble
ahem rubble
Future 2 face baman ?
Ledger was just that smooth.

Ledger decided to stay in character and play it like it was meant to happen.

Dating Dent WAS SECONDARY

I wish Scarecrow was in this scene

13notice how we linger on the civilians working it out
You want to blew the crew and guards just like that too?
13and not the prisoners
nice suit
I'm sure we can trust Joker's word
dat suit
She trust me.
Yeah :\
he is a clown trust him
He punched her..
KO!
I wish she was in DKR
KO!!!!
Don;t talk to him about hospital bills
she'll live
pawnch! XP
Another 'Live'?? Nerf that coin
Too easy
13which would imply the prisoners reached the same decision as the civilians, use the detonator but no one wants to be the one to do it
It's hard to tell rowdy from rioting as it's happening
And another thing that buggers me: It's JOKER'S plan. How are they sure that he didn't connect the detonators to their own boats?
hi DoctorDoctorWho
FIVE MINUTIES!
I mean, THAT WOULD BE THE JOKE
Fun Fact; They aren't. :D

Oh yah guys, I'm not gonna be here for Euro BMN. Going to visit my parents for the weekend.
Wouldn't that of been awkward if he missed with some of those sticky bombs?
o_o
DOO EET!
A real officer takes down the entire enemy contingent with just a tazer
Tell the SWAT that the doctors are bad..... nah lets fight them >=)
only because they haven't LET THEM BLOW YOU UP
We should recreate this experiment between ponychan and 4chan.
How do you ambush a SWAT team? Isn't their job to apprehend traps?
Never mind.
this is such an awesome setup, the clowns are hostages, while the doctors are the killers
Yeah right

Snipe him now!

Stupid SWAT officers are stupid

Never mind, they not ded.

screw batsignals
The axe was a little over the top.
come to think of it, how they kinda wash all this under the bridge in the 3rd movie is kinda disappointing.

01,11Sqallken: you don't know how the justice system works. One flaw in the prosecution could fuck up an entire case, and since Dent was responsible for 90% of the mob force being on trial, that's 90% of the criminals in Gotham running the risk of being let go.
Mare-Do-Well is the hero that Equestria needs, but not the one that it deserves... Man is she not the one it deserves... :(

05,15I have seen any episode more than twice, but Lesson Zero is waaaay overplayed/overrated
Oh, when'd we find out?
I like my Superhero movies Avergery
thanks!
Awww, look they decidcated it too him.
We should totally check out the "How it Should have Ended" for this. :D
agreed
we should have a rule on Lesson Zero
When are the movies and episodes released?
one showing every month at most
THUMBS ALL THE FUCKING WAY UP!
wb
hmmm I agree
MY THUMBS CAN'T GO ANY MORE FUCKING HIGHER
despite loving that Luna ep
Lesson Zero's still the MOST overplayed episode though.
talking is fine for me also, it may have been 2.5 hours, but it sure didnt feel long
IT'S LITERALLY TOUCHING THE MOON SRSLY LOOK OUTSIDE
When "Luna" comes on, I leave until it's over. It's played that often.
That's why I've been puttin it on my lottery
next?
I corrected them
I'm picking "Sleep". It's a severly underrated episode.
Also Ennio Morricone
Sleep?
Look before you sleep, S1E8.
Oh!
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE Do
*derp*
xD OMG baman and piderman
But (Why so)seriously: 9/10<3 - my 2nd favorite comic book movie
05,15I've been picking Owl's Well that Ends well, even though I don't particularly like that episode either
i'd likr racheal to come back as a hero
Things at the bottom?
Not people/
Watchmen
helpful as can be ponies simply signal S.O.S
05,15come to think of it, I only REALLY like most of the S1 episodes, for the most part the rest are rather meh.
makes sense I guess but I've never seen Watchmen
Well, skip!
05,15......I like trains
:O
I want to confess something...
xD
that intense noise :D
That ep is just... aah :D
^:D
I still think Spiderman 1 my favorite superhero movie
wtflarp?!
time for ponies
Mhhm
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
whats next?
thats ok, fans and non fans of FIM are welcome :)
Tank time
PONIESSS
PONIES!
pony time
PONIES
PUNIES
OHMAI
05,15This fandom has a tendency to overdo things
Why the things at the bottom?
WORNG ORDER
PONIES !!!
PONIES
PONY TIME
Czech
^
WOOHOO
catgroove
WOOOO
Oh look. Lesson Zero.
Sorry kids, it's pony time!

Ponies need to sit down lower
Wrong pony order.
Ponies watching ponies
Oh shit my favorite ep
OH!
Metaponies
*sigh*
Wait, I thought Wreks episode was the second one
aahhhhhhhh
still cant stand the intro song
01,11inb4 france/friends spam
Lesson Zero after TDK? Brilliant!
Crazy Twilight time
inb4 france
Yo dawg....
not enough checklists
They George Lucas'd the intro
Oh yeah, there's Applejack's hat :D
this is a top 10 episode in my book :D
I would like Spiderman 3 more if there was a Spiderman 4
05,15and think that absolutely everything is amazing and nothing is bad ever.
Everyone suddenly turned the volume down when TDK ended
Fraaaaaaaaaaanceee!!!
Frieeeeeeeendsss
FRANNNNCE
Freeennzzz
Lmao!
FRIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMDS
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN
3rd favorite episode for me :)
5th Fav
Don't have a favorite episode.
well, a lot of people, not just the fandom, have this weird relationship with the idea of quality.
no bye lol
^
Like 5th favourite to me
awwww he left
the clock is ticking twilight
goddamnit rainboy dash DOWN IN FRONT
I thought Let the Best Pet win was first
:O
No.
Time for OCD.
Mhhm
she has OCD
^
05,15Remember that Luna's Lament cartoon? How bad it was yet everyone flipped over it all time?
Like, for most people, they never seem to think anything could be middling, or average, or flawed but still entertaining. Everything either sucks, or it's a masterpiece
DON't BE TOO HASTY!
yep
Horrible OCD
OCD
OCD is a bad problem
rainbow dash anyone?
Yes Twilight, that would bother me too!
Luna's Lament?
Daw. My kitty just curled up in my lap. :3
oops twilight
AT THE ATOMIC LEVEL!
two twoiloight eps today then
:\
05,15Something like that I don't remember the name
she could've given the 13th one to spike
hmm
05,15Most things fall into the middle catagory for me
I liked Fluttershy's Lament <3 never heard of Luna
*Luna's
you cant devide 13 by 6 oO
down in front a bit :)
nice spike
Suddenly TAZ
13Fou_Lou: two for each mane six, one for spike
wait is this Lesson Zero?
He'll be feeling that later.
Oh wait this is Lesson Zero huh.
Fluttershy's Lament actually helped me to look up the show in the first place :D
......it begins
I thought this was the time travel episode.
Suddenly nuts
13yes
u just had to say tht spike ...
FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Sanity level: -5
fuck yes! Never watched this episode through
Yeah, Spike, that's from writing sure;)

13it's for his own good
:D
TUESDAY!
Ask for an extension
http://derpiboo.ru/102713 all from this one episode
05,15Then I probably got the name wrong, anyway, there was a cartoon that had TERRIBLE voice acting, yet people flipped whenever it was on and acted like it was the best thing ever
I put my calendar on the wall
me no like dis ep
24
not Tuesday! :O
DAT SUN
Sun is buffering.
TARDAY:O
13nissan
Poor Spike - always taking Twilight's abuse
01,11This episode alone proves that twilight's OCD.
THE CLOCK IS TICKING!
Tuesday is now the second to last day of the week, huh.
TARDY
O_o
Ponies have 7 day week confirmed
Or possibly
Tuesday: My most hated day of the week.
Why'd Spike go down there?
You send her a letter every week....execept for when the season's not going because you're not doing everything every week
the drama xD
and shes still not a queen
It would be the moon Twillight
I suppose it's worth noting, at the end of the day, does anything anyone else says matter?
You can't overthink this!
they beat them
or she could have just you know, ASKED FOR AN EXTENSION :0
This has been me lately.
magic...Kindergarted :O
13it's not demonstrated that list making is a compulsion, just efficient at ensuring things are done
The horror! THE HORROR!
Meh
ONE MILLION YEARS MAGIC KINDERGARDEN
Because Teachers always have it out for their students
13people like misusing OCD to mean any attention to detail
no not kindergarten... TO THE MOOOOOOON
i never make lists. ever.
just...just make something up Twilight.
wait why are the mst3k pony still there?
05,15people misuse a lot of mental disorders

I would make lists, but it would take me all day to get it right.
Oh Spike
Yep.

Yes, because you stop searching when you find it

but it also scares me.

THE WORST POSSIBLE THING
Here's an idea. Only let them vote for one episode a week.
05,15OKAY
x4 zoom
Pinkie Pie, you shouldnt have seen Twilight in the first place
13only seasons 1-3 ofc
05,15but only pre-movie episodes
Some people submitted G1 eps.
Trady
trolololololololololololololol
OH, you mean the pony :P
her hair is fixed?
Rainbow entrance
Basically you'd end up cycling through all 52 eps in a year.
let the trooling begin
If you're going to do it like that why don't you just remove episodes from the lottery entirely and just play them in order?
Go away Celestia, no one like you.
dat BGm from a movie
And then, for the first ep, you could make the timeout on eps longer.
1 MILLION YEARS DUNGEON
:P 3

She's not a pony. She is a horse
Luna is best pony
Yeah, where
d that come from?
male a.k.a. stud
But again, people never read.
Where'd that come from?
How are we to keep track of all that?
IDK where that came from lmako
:D
SuperPInkie!
Fuck off spike
Pinkie sure did a superman pose ther.
How many times do you think it'll get rerolled because no one noticed the "Month long time-out"

Don't let them get you down.

*throws spike in water*
What's next?
13there's a reason the intermission is 20 minutes
inb4 +m
Did they enslave Spike just to be their scribe? How do they have a written a language!
Don't forget including a link to all these rules as well as what's been shown in the previous month (for ponies) or year (for movies)
Spike DID have some useful advice for Twilight in this episode.
+m is tomorrow
If people have to hunt them down? They're not going to read them.

did anyone noticed twilight hair went to messy to fixed
Exactly.
It feels good to be back on here.

IT'S ARTSY
Yep.
The Room is the most hilarious bad movie I've watched yet. Don't touch me matherfaker.

Brb. Bathroom.
Lets do it again this time with no distractions.
Waitt.
There we go. :D
darn
01,11To someone who's had experience or is interested in film production, this is actually quite interesting to watch. Also, it's quite realistic.
xD
booooooooooooooo
lol Booooooooooooooooooooom.
think of it ... like a drive in theater but with an inn
This movie is pissing me off :D
I imagine the drama amongst the cast is just as realistic.
well shit
No more boom da boom prop.
Wes is working for free.
They can't afford anything else
Stanley Kubrick would have had the scene 50 times by now. And he'd still be demanding more takes
then he;s still overpaid. :P
well it's not opened
just the can
the cna smells bad
:D
is that it?
Kubrick I think would shoot it at different angles until he found one that is interesting.
I <3 this movie.
ooooh rumors.
I dont even know the movie ._.
I tried applying for some jobs at film studios considering I live in California, but that never got me anywhere or anything in return, and I'd stumble across a few from time to time.
05,15I'm....not sure how I feel about this. I'm very interested in filmmaking, but I feel like this is something I'd watch on my own one afternoon, not with a bunch of people
A Showtime sitcom about making movies

geez. how often does THAT happen?
I hear that in voice acting for animation, the VAs can be expected to do about a dozen readings of each line, and then it's decided afterwards which reading to use. Badly dubbed anime tends to go with only one reading.
Glad that everyone is ok.

yeah or that
11,02But I am playing this on a Wii though
Hat gamecube, but it's played in the Wii
:O I can get this on Wii :O
Or is it just the disc
Hat you can also emulate it for free!!!
it doesn't work in later Wii Models?
wait, you can't play gamecube games on newer wii models?
if you can't that's horseshit
horseshit
that's just shameful
i know the wii u can't
Then how can you play SSBB on wii then?
but still
11,02Wii U supports Wii games.
That's terrible
brawl is a wii title
i know but wiimotes suck for brawl
man, i'm glad i have a 2006 model
11,02ikr

11,02You can buy a refurbished one, or find one that contains a Wii Remote w/ Wii Motion Plus.
i am genuinely upset now
11,02NOT the one that contains a Wii Remote Plus though
well, at least they still sell gamecubes for about 20 bucks
at least at the store i'm near
Gamestop sells gamecubes for 30$
I liked the Gamecube

goddammit frankley
Metroid Prime?
Metroid Prime woop woop.

I liked 1080 avalanche, you could connect several Gamecubes and race about 14 players at once
/me has never played nor heard of 1080 avalanche
got it for about 5 bucks and didn't touch it for months because i thought it was some shitty halo/resident evil knockoff
sorry :$
^^^^^^YES
yup yup
I bought Metroid Prime Triology about 2 years agon, but I can't force myserlf though Prime 2 Echoes -.-

i need to leave now even though i barely talked (that's unusual)
player*
ten good reasons
hello all
really!???!?!?!??!
take a guess :P
why?
I want it 2
Huh, someone else that has a decent amount of games.
yes, why?
in time my friend...
if I feel like it :P
and i wont say i have 300+ games.. 25% maybe dlc
oh lol
/me watches the watch
:)
XD
hmmm..
oh
Denied.

lol never mind
connected by console
Oh just the all the best RTS games COME OUT

Heya everpony
oh, was starting to think I was the only present here O_o

o.o
at one of the popular fics on fimfiction
i just got back from Borderland 2
which is?
i'm trying to figure out this c++ linked list shit
it hurts
pointer to next element
and these nodes
a linked list is an array that can change size
it works by every element (node) having a reference to the next one in the list
you start from the beginning and count through following the references
seems easy enough
"how to outsmart a bullet"
"by saxton hale"
Thats a weird rage...
p=p
O no...
y u complaining
o.o
sophomore in the university
well back to cooking
yeah, linked lists, trees, heaps and other things
were those pikmin?
hey guys
heap is just a large non-continous piece of memory
i think alot of the problem is i forgot alot of this shit over summer because i was a complete dumbass
you didnt teach yourself over the summer?
i kept putting it off
Saxton hale
With ponies
And custom taunts
in other words, i was a complete dumbass
