6Alright.
STARE
/me is a bit blonde but does that mean a redirection? they enter the domain name and get transferred to the free host?
get over here asshole
No.

KOYANINISQUATSIIIIIIIIII~
They are two different services.
The Moon's regular phases make it a very convenient timepiece, and the periods of its waxing and waning form the basis of many of the oldest calendars
07-Listens-
lol purple
no wings?
The service we are paying for is the computer hosting our domain
It forms the basis of our modern calander
Twilight's VA doesn't do here singing either
6It requires a bit of computer and server/client setup knowledge to really... understand.
Pretty sure most of the singing voices are different from the talking voices...
6Though dari put it as simply as possible. XD
how about flutterturret?
07I see
it exists
i am unaware of flutterturret
:o
too quiet!
I'll see you guys later too, I've gotta go get a shower, than finish up my NaPoWriMo for the day, then bowling.
One or two sigRainbow Dash sings herself I think
but flutterturret is aware of you
/me nukes moon.
http://miburl.com/UkI9Sf
07NO!
I wouldn't be able to kill a Flutterturret...
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/127f50710563de166b6a3bc94a98b8cf/26779%20-%20.jpg
07not my home!
pinkie needs at least 20% more songs in s2
see flutterturret ^_^
Needs Twiliught and Rarity solos, though
ohhhhh
I missed The Stare? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DAMN YOU LUNCH
get it now, hehe
1 day probably.
07I like to return there once in a while
Oops.
Please walk in front of my laser- if that's ok with you i mean, because um... *squeal*
If you mean IRC>

Val could too, but he hasn't got his desktop.
6How many do you think it'll hold across both servers?
I have no idea.
14I can
I sent a voice message back home, but they haven't gotten back to me
This BMN.
14But not until after I move soon.
inb4 stoned jokes
But I had to get our information set up with the IRC opers.
TWILIGHT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
mibbit IRC opers*

Because otherwise mibbit wouldn't work on our server.
DEAR PRIMCESS CELESTIA

Lawyer badge
The very fist moon rover
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Lunokhod_hires.jpg
=D
I know a lot of people have been asking for a full S1 stream before S2
XD
XD
=D
If she saw one of them cocks, she would laugh at how silly it was.
6Yes, but I was hoping to do that very close to S2...
6Which wouldn't give us much time.
ugh
^
*true
The very first moon rover looked like a steampunk war tank? :0
no, isee three
well yeah, we could do it the week of S2's premiere or something
like monday-friday
It's Soviet.
Fluttershy knows her cocks
just drug them
lol
also, this cockatrice just went basilisk on their plots.
I bet she's seen many cocks
6But we need to make sure it's up and running ASAP.
lol
snail
6We don't have the kind of time for that.
Snails why?!
hmmm good point

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC8zz95rm8s
"You don't know man,you weren't there"
Fluttershy has a +9001 charisma modifier.

UMADRARITY?

Now for mood whiplash, TIME FOR RE-ANIMATOR!

In the way that you scare the children into intimidating you.

Hello boys and girls... come a little closer

I'm the reanimator...
I'm only here to give you guys moon trivia
Spectrum:this movie is amazing
10I'm not sure how well we can draw in a crowd at EU times
10on a weeknight
07and creepy...

The reanimator.
/me 14mutes
6It could be somewhere inbetween.
The Reanimator right?
Awesome
guys no spoilers
thanks
6Like, 5 PM eastern instead of 7.
this is very nonbat.
they were advertising another irc server
WTF
Moon teim
with lots of lines
SPLODE
ER IST TOT
SUDDENLY, EYES EXPLODE EVERYWHERE.
LOL.
That was probably the tamest part of the movie
And thats how Equestria was made.

Corny opening titles are corny.
*glasses*

wat
this intro is my fetish
Dat picture
good night/afternoon/morning guys
07hmm
=D
Maybe his eyes did that because he watched this movie?
any sort of well known trilogy or series could work
6We could do one of the other movie series we've got...
yeah amma go too, don't think i'll like this
later guys
before I leave
like Star Wars for example
07pirates?
Zephirdd:YOU MUST STAY
6Star Wars.
07harry potter
Not on PUURPOSE, Rezo
/me hugs Luna
6HP is too long.

Tranquility: Re-animator
byebye
07thanks for the hug :)
6Pirates is bleh.
14Ouch
07hmm
14Pirates is good
6Without the last movie, that is.
I'm all for Band of Brothers, but I'm not sure how many people know about it
wat ?
6I mean, they're still working on the Pirates series.
/me hugs a random person
10isn't band of brothers really long?
6They're making a fifth right now...
6BoB is incredibly long.
My hug!
6I think best bet is Star Wars.
You don't need them but it helps
well, it's divided into hour-long episodes
yet, it is amigo's channel
hi
and yeah, Star Wars is very recognizable
ground up moon rocks are also deadly poison too.
That re-animator song stuck in my head.
it's causing no harm on this network
also, there are zombies on the moon
14So it might work.
Is the acting intentional?
M-m-m-moon zombies?
07^
05it has my vote aswell
10which star wars films?
6All six.
all six?
SHE IS EX-FATTY.
This movie is just silly
yep, moon zombies
women as doctors
14Always Luna ;)
6Starting with Ep IV, of course.
10adnasfdadf
6Original trilogy, then prequel trilogy.
14Lmao
well they are :P
and elaborate moon bases
lol
The weak of stomach or sanity should leave
IV-VI
RobotPinie: Wat
and with good reason, if you ask me :P
This movie made twice its budget when it came out
Dat sweat
pottsi: http://dpaste.org/1pk0c/
log from ~15 minutes ago
Blame the 'Based on Lovecraft' part.
6If we do Star Wars we have to do all of them or it'll seem lazy.
Mars was all over this shit
Though I never saw the appeal in Lovecraft's writing
point.
Mars bars?
IT MOVED
05in order
Poke poke poke.
05and gotten the whoel chain of events
Dumb gracity
This was considered a romantic comedy on Mars
*gravity
nothing wrong there
10so wait, which order?
he owns the channel
05(though might be obvious)
And assumed to be non fiction.
Lazer
We need to go back to the moon and go to Mars.
EWWWWWWWWWWWW
Herbert West is boss
ok np
his*
14Dat music
Grant machine?
14No
14Latest EqD post :P
Go, West.
I'll check it out
Because everone can rip on how shitty the prequels are then.
/me runs to EqD
lol
Good night everypony!
Suddenly sex
though most can do that anyway.
Braindeath
night mazoot
14G'night Mazoof
/me hugs everyone
AngryJohn9000, we are not unfeeling, but it is his channel and his rules..
14*t
6FUKKEN CAT
6OUTTA NOWHERE
10they're just films
i understand
Night Mazoot
Pussy'd
:P*
inb4 best cut ever
10people take shit way too seriously >.>
oh hey porn
epic cut.
WTF
COCKBLOCK
Suddenly, pants
This isnt ponies
cats are the worst cockblockers ever, speaking from personal experience
Aww.
I am disappoint.
10I get a bit annoyed watching older films to be honest, despite appreciating the old films when I first watched them, I can't re-watch them really
The sexiest part hasn't even happened yet. :/
6So... vote on showing them in order release?
Subtlety is overrated.
that's why I don't have a cat ^_^
6As in 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3.
Fuck, you need an Artix account to play?
aye
6I vote yes.
ohh ok
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 makes more sense to me.
my ex's cat hated me
10well I think it makes more sense 123456
05I too vote for 123456
Zombiebutts are the best
animals like me
especially dogs...
10lol
Kill it! Kill it!
Damnit West, I was role-playing!
DAAN STOOOP I DONT LIKE IT
STOOOOP
DAAAAAN
*falls down stairs*
05becasue people are douchebags
lol xD
Sex and cats don't mix
6People don't even like the remastered versions of the originals.
10I mean, why would they be annoyed at the order?
I missed the cat, didn't I?
Herbert Moodkiller West
ponies and ponies and ponies ...
Yes
6So if we show them out of order release, they'll flip, because it kills suspense. In every way.
10the order makes no indication of preference or anything
10and also: implying suspense in star wars ACTUALLY exists anymore?
And rainbowy ponies and sunshiny ponies
you'd be surprised
Star Wars isn't aging as well as you'd think
and clouds full of ponies
Rezo, was that "yes" at me?
6There are plenty of people that haven't seen all the Star Wars movies...
which makes me a sad pony
6Especially not in the order they were intended.
Star Wars is only average anyway.
6Which is the order they were released.
123456 makes more sense, but 456123 is more entertaining.
Might spoil the movie if I elaborate.
10well the prequels don't -ruin- the story of the 456
like, they completely do
I'm probably the only one, though...
No. For that tiger thing
*drip*
12<prince-dari>: Star Wars is only average anyway
12^heresy
*drip*
6They do. They really do.
as I said, Empire Strikes back is completely ruined if you know Vader is his father
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
TA DA
skag re-animator
MAGIC
Well I'm not that bothered.
6Most of it is completely ruined.
You haven't
Either way then.
thanks
10how could someone not be familiar with vader being his father, and want to watch a star wars marathon? O.o
Suddenly, Skull
6-_-;
uuuuuuuu pretty
EWEWEWEWEWEEWEWEWWW
Wait 'till the end :P
because they know star wars is popular but yet never took the time to watch it?
mmmmmmm
they shower nice feelings and hugs from THE SKY!
toupe
Neat.
BONESAW
6Because maybe they want to watch them because they haven't seen them all?
Everyone knows Vader is Luke's father.
EVERYONE.
10^
Because "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
6Doesn't matter.
tell that to my older sister when I showed it to her a year ago...
14The music is silly and addicting like Nyan Cat too
And ponies and ponies and ponies and poonies....
poonies?
6Showing them out of release order would be like showing LotR with Two Towers first.
ponies.
:D
dat song
10O_______________________O
6It's not how they're intended to be watched, frankly.
*snaps pen*
well, I think we should just vote it and let that be done with it
snap
lol
we aren't going to change anyone's minds
that song, totally ruins the mood of this movie and its awesome.
10well you guys seem much more adamant than I am
Yeah, I'm not bothered.
10me neither really
6Alright, vote. Prequels first or order of release.
10I'm just giving my opinions
14lol
10well didn't we just say that a vote is kinda pointless?
6We did not.
6At any point.
not going into this alone, dawg.
lol, they banned me for complaining -.-
need that music
14Not sure yet. XD
Does it cost money, though?
:P
14Its free
Creepy...
whats free?
It's an account that lets you play all of the games on their website.
I might try it, then.
how long is that movie?
eh
10Yeah but it might not be sensible to weight my honest opinion the same as one of yours, since you seem to be much more sure of yourselves
Westurbating.
>.<
05I see the point, though i cant decide, do whatever I fold.
http://miburl.com/UN5cZ3 HOW LUNA ENDED UP ON THE MOON!
14I dont care either way. XD
"Its just a lot of little things" "ponies!"
okay, I may have come across to blunt. If the vote says 123456 I'm fine with that, I was just saying my opinon on them
i would pay money for that song
poor kitty
05aye
pspspsppss
07doesnt matter to me
05just to have something to go on, 123456
6I'm saying 456123
10well again. Don't weight my opinion the same as yours
Combustiblelemons:OMG HOW DID YOU KNOW?
west is a douche.
Cats are tomatoes.
10so I might aswell say I don't care, to even it out :P
And my cat's here.
05jsut voted for personal preference
6>personal preference
sbsbsbsbsbs = cat call
07come on people there's more to discuss
dat bg music
05>correct
That's not how you call a cat!
looks like that pussy *glasses pull* got fucked up
14RAAAAGE
let's just move on, and put a poll on the forum shall we?
07So we see ^
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaah
10valthejean, mfw that solves nothing :P
6We need to decide NOW, Val.
oiy
6No polls that'll only delay it.
07ok vote do eeet
07now
Guess that cat won't be blocking any cocks any time soon.#
071 minute *sets timer*
10again, is anyone -opposed- to 456-123?
6 456123
10instead of a vote
05then its settled
07456123 it is?
05lets continue
07done
it suffocated .. in my fridge
BLACKMAIL
6 456123 it is.
6Done.
JARATE.
6When do we do it, and how?
07so much discussion :D
glowstick juices
afk
6Monday-Tuesday at 5 PM Eastern or Tuesday-Wednesday at same time?
buy that it suffocated
6This week it needs done.
DID I HEAR JARATE!
10doesn't it need to be 3 nights?
11Monday is Labor Day in US.
6Indeed it is...
07Do we have everything ready?
10what does that mean, is it a holiday?
07infrastructure / technical that is?
it basically means no one works
AND I AM IN
11It's an odd holiday.
and no one has school
is his falls down stairs
Time to make a pony
11We Celebrate a day of labor by not going to work.
6Which is why I think Monday-Tuesday.
THAT is how you barge into a room!
rofl
ahaha
10yeah we have the same, may day bank holiday
i won
6At 5 PM Eastern.
ty
07No house next week :)
fail.
well if we're going to get through 6 movies we may need to start earlier
is it even possible to find that scary
6That's why it's at 5, Val.
MEOW
6Instead of 7.
6And no episodes.
dat noise the cat does
10well all the EU/UK young'uns are going back to school this week
07^
6So it's 456 on Monday, 123 on Tuesday.
07I lolled
All film cats need this Meow SFX.
6Again, that's why 5.
10 3 films per night?
Beating up on a cat :< Someone call PETA!
That's one strong cat.
6Any earlier and they won't be back from school.
it doesn't need to be scary when it's this cool
Sounded like a RC plane to me.
6Splitting it differently would be weird.
epic cat
Problem, PETA?
wut?
wow for a second i thought the cat was laughing
05So it's 456 on Monday, 123 on Tuesday. <i agree
same here
10I guess the minimum damage is that EU people can't watch part of 5 and/or all of 6
is anyone able to stream them?
11Sounds good to me.
07Wrek can you make a poster?
07banner and all that?
05in less than a week?
07:D
05ouch
Herbert West: tells bad jokes

"
Oh that reminds me, HAHA you euro people dont get silverscreens movie trivia
14o.o
I was here yesterday
Dat motif.
11We could just show a random movie or streaming for Labor Day and see how that goes.
I saw it all
Soon Britain shall take the moon, for our glorious empire.
14We cant stop here. This is bat country.
why is a guard down there ? does bodies get stolen ?
MEATBALL.
10google tt0274518
I havent seen the queen on mars yet :/
Aw, Adventure Quest really wasn't all that good :(

The bodysnatchers

Same thing to most americans honestly :D
Lawl.
came*
14:P
14And everypony came...
14But anyway...
10hehe
Like when people say "America" they usually mean North America
Which is very odd, considering they know about Scotland, Ireland and I assume Wales.
I call it the US :P
14Hmm, random movie for labor day...
into
14Nah
yes i think u
I call it AHMURIKA, TBH
Poland cannot into spcace.
6True...

07:D
It glows, therefor, it works.
14Lol
6Trololol
lol. Mtn. Dew = miracle cure
MOUNTAIN DEW WAS THE ANSWER ALL ALONG
I have never seen that film.
14Luna seems to like it... :P
6I suppose we could go with Season 1 if we do it all day Monday...
07:D
I intend to continue that way.
11Season 1 All day Monday
10hahahaa dari
if only those Fighting with Magic people had used us for their stream...
Hah.
More moon facts
That'd have worked.
6Whatever happened with them?
14:P
I have no diea
Rainbow Dash
idea*
10brb need a drink
this movie
The newly formed Moon would also have had its own lunar magma ocean; estimates for its depth range from about 500 km to the entire radius of the Moon
6Did they do a release yet?
14Didnt they just kinda forget about us?
reviving the living
lol
hmmmm
05again and again and again
6Well, they're one of the things on our list of business for this meeting.
11We're going off topic

14I was thinking on the mod pics.
Ok.

LUNA, YOU'RE BRILLIANT]
okay, roll with me on this
Nice timing rex
Sumica's stream has been worked out, yes?
11..
we advertise a global "Hey look at our streaming the Hub Quality"
10hmm

Best day ever.

Herbert West: Like a boss
10just no.
14Lmao
07hahahaha
10:P
07troll

Otherwise no one would ever trust us again.
XD
annnd lose 1d10 San
Herbert West: Professional Comforter
haha
10it can be HUB and/or just random TB
10TV*
11SECRET BUTT FUN!
14:P
10since we can just change channels
05hmm
6I'm sure people would like to see Regular Show if it's on...
but I'm sure lots of people would be interested to see if we can ACTUALLY stream the Hub (or various TV in this case)
6That's the point, Val.
lol
lol
6We can show SOME HUB, but we'll be showing everything live TV.
with that being said, we'll need to let our S2 streamers know
05so some hub streaming
"HI THERE!"
05sprinkled (lol) with movies?
geez he really was going to tell her every creepy detail
07yes but there's much more in the agenda
07we need to speed up a little
"No respect, no respect at all!"
05okie
CREEPYDOC!
6So when are we doing this?
14Also need to make sure our live streamers are available of course
CREEPYDAD!
6Thursday?
6To get the word out?
10I guess
I CAN NOW NEVER UNSEE
07we first need to make sure our livestreamers are informed
should we get on skype and see if any of our streamers are online?
11Wednesday.
Reeeespeeeeect

THE STARE
07maybe even get them a subforum
07streamer forum

6Alright... I think we can move on to the next topic.
SHOVEL TIME
07sprinks how you feel about the subforum?

Wait, Drawfriend is this early today?
6I could set it up quite easily.
I haz shuvel
This isn't normal...

6But regardless, next topic.
07no wait
07head
YEEEAAAAHH!
Yes.....
SERIOUSLY.
07ok
This movie is about to get A LOT weirder
COME ON.
Nittany_Tiger:cause herbert dont give a damn
he was gonna steal the one thing West really enjoys
"Kill me"
"Later"
XD
Then Herbert does something really dumb.
this is awesome
ASSSSSS
sssssssssss
I wouldn't want to do that.
Though.
You
well i feel fine
WEEESSSSSSSSSSSST /Flapjack
he STILL hasn't learned to strap them down?
lol
wtf am I watching
Now, this movie takes a turn to the REALLY fucked up.
lol elky
also, how far in the movie are we?
6First off, gotta find out what's going on with the Fighting is Magic team.
bout halfway
THE HEADLESS HORSE
ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies
We're around the end.
6Who was it that originally contacted them?
how can he inhale without lungs?
I hope, we're at the good part
XD
Damn thats easy
THAT'S HOW
Yes, this is getting to the good part :P
I don't think we contacted them to start with.
injecting mountain dew revives decapitated heads, I guess
I said that already ;_;
6We contacted them to start with.
11I was the first to contact the Fighting is Magic Team.
6Silver, could you re-contact them at some point, just to ask how things are going?
11Basically they said that they'd occasionally update us and eventually give us a date for the release.
6>occasionally update
looks like he...lost his head
11I can do that.
6>haven't herd from them
6Alright.
badum tsss
YEEEEAAAAAAHH!
man, I am on a roll today
du dun dun
HAAHHAHAHAHHAHA
bwaahahhaahahaha
creepy laugh
... seriously?
6It doesn't need to be immediate.
/me is cheerfully pwning ponies on Pony versus Pony
Oh no.
14Well, if we dont need it before S2, then...
05what cotavia said
the music makes this hilarious
derp
stupid body
10just saying >.>
is it just me or is the head snoring
14But if we dont need the banner before S2 starts, then I saw we try and get her to make one for us. Would be awesome.
yep
6We need to discuss everything that's just been floating about.
bloodgasm
07exactly
AWWW YEAAAHHH
I'm unfamiliar with Mad Max's work, could I get a link?
14Also, great publicity to be done by her
he's taking a...bloodbath
ho HO!
doh ho ho
More moon trivia
6Silver, it'll look like a revamp'd version of the .co.cc site.
geez, just get the stapler and fix yerself
>mfw 'Ponies and Ponies and Ponies and Ponies and...'
suddenly mind control
The more you know.
O.o
it's twoface
Also
half face!
seems legit
10vertical banners?
07including the news letter
Break time.
No, THIS seems legit.
10any fears about the window getting too wide?
>20%
Best guard in the world
14Theyre going to be re-sized to all fit on it properly.
Full of headdy goodness.
10ah ok. But I assume they won't be used on the theatre page much then?
Wait ... where was he going?
10because everything on that is landscape really
6Not on the individual pages, no.
Take a break
oh right
Ponies and Ponies and Ponies and Ponies
10oh I see
10brbrbrbrbrbrbrb a drink and some crackers
11...
07GG just logged on
and ponies are cool
So...Are we getting a domain then?
6We are.
We really need to sort that. Sort of...Now.
Ignore that 45,it never existed
6We just discussed it...
MOONSPEAK!
6Like, already.
Yeah, but we didn't DO anything.
6We're getting a .net domain.
dohohoho
herbert west crater
Wiki copy pasta
We didn't discuss paying for it.
6It's a dollar a year. -_-;
07not a dollar :o
6From 1 and 1.
that's one overprotective papa
6Whatever stupidly low amount.
lol
sort of
11yes?
huh?
Anyway, having a separate page for each room would be a bit of a fail.
6What's the problem with that, exactly.
INB4 terrible things happen
6Dari, I plan on making the pages themed per room.
RAPE
rape
:I
RAPE
I saw that it was made by the adventure quest guys...
I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING
boobies?
>:|
i approve
6Then they wouldn't be able to join if it's full.
Rap?
Here's the good part :P
whoa
DO NOT WANT
omg the look on his face
It still seems like a fail.
To me.
wow, it must be cold in that room....
Heres some plastic rap
Because the whole traffic lights system is pointless then, the users don't need it.
http://blog.fabmagazineonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Vita-Wrap-Plastic-Wrap-305m.jpg
MY FETISH
.....
and by servers I mean rooms

West is such a straight-up pump
*James bond reference*
DAMN

SHOOT EM IN THE HEAD
It's close to miiiiiiiidniiiiiiiiight...
His own head is his evil cat.
unlimated powaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
6The light system is the best working system for the moment.
you mean "this is how Equestria was made"?
Close enough
6A LOT of people have problems with that idea, dari.
lolwut.
Best guard ever
cmon shoot em
DAT GUARD
nothing unusual here
lol
the guard: "Fuck. I'm this high?"
go, rent a cop, goooo
6Many, many viewers have voiced their opinions on it.
I JUST RELIZED SOMTHING GUISE!
"What the fuck did I just walk into?"
14I can understand that.
guard: dayum I must be trippin' balls again
Best fight scene
SPLAT
oh damn
Seems legit
OVERDOOOOOOOOOOOOOSE!
OVERDOOOOSE
OVERDOSE
LOL
OR AT ALL FOR THAT MATTER
oh shit
6Val... we're really not.
glow stick juice OD
he just OD's on Mountain Dew!
6It's a fairly easy setup and it's easily maintained. -_-;
lol?
Oh he's going DUAL Syringe.
Well thats, disgusting
wat
Wat
COCAINE TIME
that guy's got gutts
oh damn
I think we should actually do something about the domain instead of just talking about it.
no guts, no glory
i'm not going to sleep this night at all
and then everyone died
Smokers got West!
NOOO
oh shit
Shit shit shit!
NO NOT WEST

CRAB BATTLE
Leave West to die. Worst L4D group ever.
Ewww, I got brain on my hands!
dat music
and he runs away
TO GET AX
he's just been...disarmed
I gotta axe you something!
that reminds me of a crappy horror named Cabin Fever or somewhat
Yep. Not his day.
me gusta
FFFFFFFFFFFFF. Pony versus Pony; to get from lvl 3 to lvl 4, you need 27 exp. To get from lvl 4 to lvl 5, you need 640.
SHE IS EX-WOMAN.

EVERYONE I KNOW IS DEEEEEEEEEEEEED
I ACCIDENTALLY THE EXP CURVE
MOAR BOOBIES
necrophilia time
Anyone else at level 4 yet? :0

Some mountain dew?
ideeeeeeeaaaaa
I'm not familiar with her work, but if she's well known then it can only help gain viewers
^
THAT'S OKAY! I DIDN'T WANT TO SLEEP ANYWAY!
looks like he's going to do the dew
bad idea
MOUNTAIN DEW TIME
best idea
dat bg music
I thought she usually did comics or something.
THE END
AND THEY DIED
and then everypony came
*Applauds this masterpiece*
I tried googling her but all I got was weird 80s films :P

Speaking of re-animator...

14Yeah, shes very good. And very nice.
I've actually seen that pic twice before.
it's FOREVERRRRR face.
yeah i think it was on a EQD drawfriend
I posted it around the beginning of the movie.
Wait, did somebody write a fanfic involving ponies and reanimator?
14Well, not sure if anyone contacted her for a price yet.
6Somepony contacting her.
14Supposed to do that.
if they didn't they need to
AND THEN THERE WAS TRAFFIC CONE

Now, ENDLESS HEAD BOBBING!
/me headbobs.
^
I guess West got the right amount of Dew with the head.
14Thats cool.
14Shes creative, I'm sure we can trust her to do something great.
ahh ok
dat headnod
14Someone with a dA account could contact her.
West survives in the sequels i heard
He went to reanimate Cthulu?
cause ponies
it's like rickroll- no matter how many times you hear it it doesn't get old
It's awesome.
10we have a BMN dA account
something very rare from music
6lol wut?
14That works.
name of song>
6Since when?
?
West escaped and went on to make more mistakes against nature
By haddaway
14I didnt know about it either. lol
Clemson won.
Was Beyond reanimator a musical?
Theres a sequel to that movie?
I knew we had one.
14But we've kinda done that with two of three groups now on sites. Made them without everyone knowing. :P
Several
2 sequels, i thimk
*think
Charackters
were they any good or was it the same "sequels suck"
are the sequels good ?
ung, I hate getting off topic but sprinks they're asking if you're taking requests. Should I link them the requests page or tell them you're not taking any?
07alright next item?
imho, the sequels were ok
Hey
SON OF A BITCH, SNIPS
Tell Gravekeeper to get cracking on his next chapter! :p
West used fiber!
I'm surprised someone noticed me
14So yeah, just someone needs to contact her and get a price and we'll move from there.
6One moment.
ITs ok
I never get noticed
Moskau?
MOSKOW MOSKOW
k then
MUST DO MOSKAU
no i've got one actually
I'm not on there. I lurk though.
lolerror
Or not
kthc
Ooh
kthx*
inb4business
:D
do that.
pleeeease.
wow, you should make an account :D
10did some research
ok I'm starting to be fed up with taht one too
Oh this is just as good
I've been lurking off and on since BronyCray mentioned you guys
trixie=huns?
I could do that if you'd like. Though I'd need to either make a DA page or get access to the one we own
hehe, yeah, there's a couple of writers on there
3 or 4
I'm guessing this from Mulan.
10>DCD's personal dA page >watchers >*CSImadmax
14I think I remember him mentioning that now.
07we have a DA account + channel
10yep
Well it has to be a suitable banner.
and then the Bang Shishigami inspired one
noone? okay :(
Bah, I need to be more active on there though
We should have some basic guidelines.
10we should also mention rough size / dimensions
10and the text that goes on it
They had Gym in school in the oriental times?
He's an incredible singer (mostly because he was in an opera school at a young age).
Maybe in his native language.
^ Yup
i coudn't believe it till i saw it
It is the best thing. Seriously.
Yes, Nittany
Chan was born in america wasnt he?
No
6Our current banner is 600x300
I saw one of his concerts on TV once.
Is he singing this?
Shows how much i know
I'll check his singing... later
also, no
My roommate has a bunch of Chan's CDs
10should we migrate away from the whole 'movie theatre' theme?
He actually released a whole bunch of albums in China
10BMN has been our main attraction up until now, but in a few weeks it won't be
chan was born in poland
10we'll just be a pony stream site
Poland?
Really
6Uh, no, we're known as a theater-esque site.
10general pony and pony accessories* stream site
6That's the whole point.
14I think maybe it should stretch a little further horizontally
HNNNNGH
Srs?
buffering.
HERCULES MUSIC
He was born in Hong Kong
lol
BUFFER!
6I dislike buffer.
play snake whilst you buffer!
unless it loads
I think our plan is to branch out.
dat buffer
Oh lord
10we're known as that, but we're also moving into the S2 thing, and becoming less of a one-attraction pony
*reads description below*
Huh, On Air.
Those eyes!
D---> Oh My
Who's streaming?
0.o
LOL
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
D----> I Think I Require
D-----> A Towel
this song... do not like
14Honestly, I dont know about -biggest- media site, but he wants to incorporate things like draw chats and such and archives
>brain parasite that takes over rats' brains and makes them walk towards cats to get eaten
WHY DO I NOT WANT TO CUT MY EARS OFF?
is it bad that this is oddly catchy?
THis song, in my head, FOREEEEVVVVVVVVERRRRRRRRRR
10seen that, hilarious
14...
you've mentioned that before dari, but we *really* need to stay focused
i don't like it :/
By all rights I should hate it but... I don't. =/
same
Maybe it's because Rarity...
Yup it's catchy
I think "I cant decide" is FAR more catchy
By the scissor sisters or somthing like that
When I have nothing to contribute with the current conversation I go off topic.
Yeah
10:3
Andcreepy
Yep
For Pinkie, of course
WIth pinkie pie and dash
I don't have anything to say on the MadMax topic.
there is sorta
14lol
6And yet why would we have a banner that includes future things in it? It makes no sense to advertise for things that you don't yet do.
Search Pinkie pie cant decide
http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpvm4g489b1qmkva0o2_500.gif
yeah
10I never said put 'BronyState: #1 S2 stream site'
well depending on how steep the price is, we could do a theater related one now, and then do another later down the road
14We could try to vaguely point at other things? I dunno lol
10just maybe move -away- from the theatre thing
zav kinda made it longer than it needed to be
There should be one for the whole song.
10idk, it was just a thought>.>
http://www.leethacker.com/images/4vw7qsn0e1lf308if85o.png
the plot is my favorite part *Creepy wink*
Well have the text "BronyState" and don't have it themed like a theatre.
I just got back, I immediately regret it it
Welcome back i gues
lol
T_T
song
OH I CANT DECIDE
voted for nm
We're not even known for streaming a lot now.
WEATHER YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE
notsureifokaywiththis.jpg
6lol wut?
Brace yourself for later, there's only going to be one request I'll make
and of course it'll be sea poies
it's too femenine!
SHOO BE DOO
SHOO BE DOO
it buuurns!
well, this is something to note:
people may not know about us now
but when S2 hits
o_O
MUAHAHAHAHAHA
nooooo
notsureifwant.png
10well it's a balance between our old-school movie theatre image, and the whole newfangled S2 style we're implementing, and we're expecting a huuge load more viewers
it's going to explode
My request is Moskau
10Sprinkles is deaaaad D:
I request Moskau or Pinkie Pie cant decide
^
I request money
ditto
SHHH....
lots of it
seems kinda boring to me
don't say that. Gabe's watching >.>
6Yes dari, but you don't advertise as doing something you don't yet do.
now that is something I agree with
We won't be advertising anything.
10just not dwelling on the movie theatre thing
XD
Not movie specific.
they announced it for 2012 I heard
6Which is why I don't want to give any guidelines... at all.
...
After the world ends
fck, I just lost the reason to live ._.
Well it should have the text "BronyState" on it.
11...
6It'll be professional, because frankly why wouldn't it be?
07and could be used for other communication channels?
My reason to live is Season 2
How about after "Meet the pyro" comes out?
That works.
6>said that was the plan ten minutes ago
6Seriously guys... >>;
14Well, there we go.
07alright next item
meh.
>.<
14I still think though it sohuld be stretched maybe a little more horizontally. But eh.
And season 3, and season 4... maybe even S5 :D
6FAWK BUFFER
That's the unoficial greeting of BMN.
yfw there won't even be S4
XD
lol
but I'll happily back down to discuss other things
saved by the buffer.
6;-;
10:3
Why are we talking about Season 5? We should be pondering Season 12
Whats the deal with all these girly songs broski?
DAT BUFFER

6BUFFER WHY?
lol
Is this Rarity hour?
YEAH
Possibly
I approve of Holding Out For A Hero
NO
I WANT TO SEE EXPLODING MONSTERTRUCKS GAHRHAHRAGH!
Girly songs to a show with a primary demographic of girls. Revolutionary!
keep loading, loading, loading
14The script is good and simply when its actually working.
10what about it? Is it in need of changing?
FACKING BUFFER!
6lol BUFFER
DAT AD
Buffer: No more Rarity
dat ad
It only doesn't work when I'm not here.
07.. did you see the topic on the forums?
:P
14*simple
this is okay.
epic ad
14lol Dari
well, for one we've had complaints about picking anons/afk'ers
07come on please i'm not posting for fun on there...
wtf... G3 IT BURNS
dat ad is a link to a website thats unsafe
To the ladies? sonofa...
10sorry Luna i find it hard to keep track of everything everywhere >.>
Night of Pony?
14About the anons, I dont mind. People afk, eh...
inb4buffer
O GOG
i scanned it lol
AWWW YEAHHH
WHY
lol
a bottle of jack .........
noooooooo
I am fully convince Kesha's musical career is a parody
noooooooooooooooooooo
Ugh, Ke$ha
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
......
10what thread is it in?
I tried to close the ad... lol
If they're AFK we move over to the next person.
Why does it matter?
well, as bjorn put it, a lot of anons didn't have a movie in mind, and got frustrated
AWFUL SONG
FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU-!
UMAD everyone?
6Honestly I'd like to take anons off the script, if possible.
FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
14Then we skip to next person.
GOG WWWWHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYyy
Well, her name has a dollar sign in it.
WITH BIKINIS ON TOP
YES
Fing Buffer!
Not possible.
TERRIBAD
*trollface*
WHERE ARE YOU!?
I MAD
They're aren't 'anon'.
/me mutes stream
WHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHY?
6Then we'll just skip them when they come up on the list.
6Agreed?
They're just randomised names mibbit comes up with.
07YES
11They're mib_randomname
She's probably just being made popular by her labe,l not her talent.
COME TO ME BUFFER
I don't mind this music.
tbh I can't actually bring myself to hate most of these stupid pop songs
10some people might get annoyed with that
it's tolerable ^_^
6It'll require a script.
Buffer hates us
10they might not have picked a name yet
I know I should
i can Elky :D
LOL DRAMATIC READING
10and they may still want a movie recommended
Streamer is all "Problem, Bronies?"
6-_-;
We should listen to "Rainbow Factory"
OF THIS SONG
In other words, Ke$ha = corporate whore.
6No based on movies.
but I really hate those pretty boys with a guitar trying to seem sensitive
ya
Elky: Everyone does.
I know.
14I agree its kinda unfair to just take them out of the lottery. But I know its also pretty simple to just pick a name.
it would require a bit of revision to the lotto mind you
but we basically have some way of submitting recommendations for movies prior to the stream
Do ponies have deoderent?
More pop stars need currency signs in their names.
SorenxSoarin
just call me The YenTender then
make it happen
... meh. The best thing about this song is ponies.
6No requesting ahead of time.
DOB is awesome, anyone read that novel thing he wrote, Bartender? It's hilarious.
6Just... no.
... that's just wrong elky
this was bad and you should feel bad
10why not? D:
6It's as simple as no.
Oh wait
umad viewers?
oh gawd is that an d for G3.5 pony?
*an ad
Play Nao
10makes sense I guess
AD, Y U NO G4
Play it play it play it!
Bohemian
PLAH NAOUH AHGHHGHGERGHA
does it bring any more bias than when mods are selected for the lotto?
WE'VE BEEN TROOLED
nooooo
6BUFFER WHY?
awww yeaaah
omg
Not the sea ponies.
NOOOOOOO
Well, I have nothing else to say.
Okay now we're just being punished
BUFFER FTW
14Its random.
XD
10that's not bias at all, since it's random
SHOOBE DOO
No
NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO Y U BUFFER?
dammit
OH MY FUCKING LORD
DAMMIT
WE'RE SAVED
NO
NO
I wanted sea ponies :(
>zombies exist
moar like SHOO BE DON'T
THEY HAVE SHOWN MERCY!
every day I'm bufferin'
10O.o
....
14Since everyone, including the mods are picked at random, its not biased.
lol
Silly Pony is the best one ever.
The Gods of Buffer have taken pity upon us!
6Knowing the movies ahead of time may bring up the idea of bias, even if we're not.
oh, don't think you've escaped
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCYM
DAMMIT
no one likes my joke :-;
ha.
SCYM
wanka!
6People can go "HOW DO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT OUT OF THE LIST/PUT IT IN THE LIST MORE THAN ONCE?"
Herbert West wouldn't be stopped by buffers.
well I was just saying for the list, the actual randomization could still be done in stream
Pretender: that pun gave me cancer
6Doesn't matter.
all in a day's work
Cause sniper does
11Sprinkles, are you doing requests?
6Not at the moment.
6I've already stated this.
I can't help being "punny"
Let's vote.
6Dari.
>Any other alternate system, or just the current system
6I'm not done talking about it yet.
11Current system.
CODEFAIL
6FFS
6Let me finish guys.
oooh.
buffer
UGH
10dari haitian voodoo is crazy
oh yayt
which one is this?
This stream is buffer
OH YEAH!
yep yayt
buffer!
*troll buffer*
FUCK
Y U NO REFRESH
wow that sewwtiebell look
that helps right?
derp
6I'd like to have a script that opts them in. That way we don't have people afk or wanting to be skipped.
I don't like that version.
they can't it'll take to long to buffer
6Why not?
Oh well, at least I downloaded all those songs.
07<< netherlands
Well,I'm back
< germaney
<Russia
< germany
classical music time.
<Doesnt even know where the netherlands are lol
Assume people are stupid.
10true
It's a good assumption.
6It'd be a button.
6Just a button.
<Poland
A button...?
<California
Man, i need a damn map
<< Sweden
How are you planning to implement this?
(best country)
<Slovenia
ಠ_ರೃ quite.
< England
<New Hampshire
I'm from America's Mitten. :D
<New York
all background ponies are horrible
germany
/me 11sighs.
<NYC
there really is no 'best'
ELFY TROLOLOLOL
Elky shall burn for that.
moon cannon time?
OR MADAM
Well now you've told us the way you'd rather do it, can we vote?
I HAVE NO IDEA
yes.
10GamerGodJones I'm from england :P
only seapony!Lyra is good
Music playing Pony with Bow tie, horrible? I don't get it.
14Personally, I'm fine with our current system
USA has best weather.
derpy/bonbon?
all other bg ponies are just one little step above OCs
USA is doomed.
6I have no issue with the current system.
I agree
6However viewers seem to.
yup
England got boring
6And that's my concern.
We're doomed, but still have best weather.
we rule
11I haven't heard any complaints.
07Well if we all agree on keeping the same it stays.
>inb4 bankruptcy, social collapse and civil war.
07let's move on
11And half the time that I do, it's just that they're bitching because they aren't selected.
Should get a Trollometer
10xD
Civil War? Hated that comic
14lol
YES!
Honestly, that would be nice.
6Well, that's it for now.
ok now pray to the gods of buffer to have mercy!
I'm one of the people help making it more fun :D
NOOOOOOO
14Ponies!
6We need the streamers here to discuss it, dari.
6So... we're pretty much set.
I mean website wise.
:Darthvaderno:
derp
BRB EVERYBODY I NEED TO USE THE URINATION STATION
JUST A PSA
as do O
nooooo
as do I
if we can't have sea ponies, we won't have anything else
6What have we not discussed?
10I want to know about this mod/admin thing and the mod teams
That is inexcusable.
buffergod, you buffer then
them*
...
doing*
/me grabs a pitchfork and menaces towards the buffer.
6The light system, dari?
How do people navigate to the different rooms?
10gamergodjones.. no, just no
are
Do they click the main 6 pictures?
6Yes, dari.
11Brony Show constantly advertises BMN
Do the pictures get locked when the rooms are full?
6No.
hello
How should the traffic lights be made?
11We can make an official partnership with them and support each other.
Everybodies sanity slip.
6Silver, can it wait a moment.
6Flash preferably.
back
/me 11quiets.
6Whichever is easier for you to code, dari.
Cat lady picture incoming.
IMHO RArity and Twilight are the most sane
10nope :p
i didnt at all
lol
D:
*Cries*
i liked when you were away
6Yes.
(essentially rendering the frontend pointless)
someone was away?
i am a cruel person
you want to give her a hug :(
6How does that render anything pointless?
FOOLPROOF TRAP
^
10the majority of recurring viewers anyway
6Who cares?
Um. . . did any mod get that?
rarity is a brazilian stripper?
Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie have the best sanity slips.
lol
...
I got myself a soda too
applejack doesn't even really have one
:D
We need to have a contest
6And if they don't pay attention to the lights, it's their fault if they whine about not being able to get in when it's closed.
oh man, THIS part
this one as well :D
No ive said wierder
it's like theres another me on earth
11...if Dari was good with CSS, clicking on the picture could change the style and connections while keeping it on the same page.
10well just saying something is their fault doesn't help that much. you kinda have to assume a lot of people are dumb enough to get it wrong, and failsafe it as well as you can
PREETY RUDE? IT WAZ DOWNRIGHT DEEZPICABLE!
out of curiosity
because she's Pinkamena?
would we as mods have the ability to transfer people to other rooms?
But yeah I can have multiple style sheets and switch them.
6Yes, Val.
6Well, not forcibly.
/me 11is just tossing random thoughts out to feel like part of the conversation.
I did the for the konami code on the front page.
Eh, makes sense.
that*
Switches out style sheets.
yep.
How boring, he was my favorite
hold on actually. someone made them ponies
But the problem is it'd also have to switch the HTML.
And I'm not sure if I can do that.
6I'm just trying to keep this easiest for everyone, since we have little time.
Got pics of it?
I'm getting sleepy
Wow that sounded creepy, anyway
I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I'VE HAD ENOUGH
/me buffers
Dat buffer.
/me explodes
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GHwuZjgTcvU/TlfpuekLF4I/AAAAAAAAABg/ih38fJxUyp0/s1600/party_of_four_by_frostheartissiamese-d3k0vip.png
there you go
BUFFER, Y U TERROR
pinkies "friends" as ponies.
/me lol
That is great!
I dont like his colors
Dunno if everyone's alright with that.
needs to be saved!
6Works for me.
07works for me
14Sounds reasonable.
Yes.
looks
6If it's not full.
The first join is automatic because of mibbit though.
Just a though...
well I suppose that could be okay. Though we should add a FaQ to our page
Whichever room URL you're on.
explaining this to the viewers
You can join any of the rooms from it.
Rendering this WHOLE system pointless.
SHE STOLE MY SONG
6Not really.
SHE'S SUCK A BITCH
Because they can access any of the rooms from any of the pages.
Such*
thought*
watch out...
Pinkie > Buffer
smooth jazz fluttershy.
6There'll be a theme to them all in the future.
I prefer Piknie turret version of this one
Does anybody know if there is a Reanimator pony fanfic? or do i have to go annoy ponychan
suddenly, Timmy Turner
no not this
Theme won't match the room you're in necessarily though.
Because you can join whichever you want.
6Won't matter.
herospirit, agreed
6It's for the enjoyment of the viewers.
/me 11is lurking at this point.
the end ^_^
dat fluttershy face
11if that's the case, I redirect you to my previous suggestion:
suddne;y, buff... nah it's boring
Where would it be then
aww :D
11Do it like Ponychan does. Give a Themes option tab.
Spike is best pony. :/
Because i cant find anything ever, its like a curse
nice place to buffer
That can be done.
11Simple and easy.
theres a macro of that!
Hey, I think every Pony is Best Pony.
oh this one
half my brain is full of pony macros D:
6We'd have to have a list of rooms off to the side, though...
damn you buffer
XD
have you buffered I beg?
But Pinkie said Twilight was Best Pony in that song.
07buffer likes to buffer us tonight
11It'd be a part of the FAQ
6We could do one page, tab for themes, and invite only rooms.
6Not a part of the FAQ.
6Because we still need them to know if the room is full or not.
VIEWER IS NOW FURIOUS
Gonna buffer soon.
critical hit!
And hostnames if necessary.
6That works.
REFRESH STREAM we are already past the buffer
/me hugs Luna for no real reason
please let this play buffer
hugs for luna you say?
11I like that.
/me hugs Luna for an actual reason
/me sacrifices virgins to the buffer gods
/me hugs Luna
room*
Sells food at a place where there is free food.
More moon trivia?
07sec looking at sat pics
6...what room?
TOO MUCH HUG, NICENESS OVERLOAD
I'd buy those appletastic treats
/me hugs Luna
derpy
11a mane room that has no cap.
6...NO.
Room which everyone can join, but there's a throttle of 1 message every minute or longer.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzDy22hCVZA
She only has pie, and one is Soar's
I've still got plenty left
6Trottle?
6...okay then...
inb4 best part
11Throttle*
GGgala: Interestingly enough, it says 3503:14:02:20 until next stream.
inafter best part
6Gimme a second.
10so like a slow room?
10I dunno how well that might work though
pinkie!
Dashie's part > all others.
10maybe just for off-peak times
Off-peak is when it definitely wouldn't work.
10but at peak times it'll be a flood and a half
10oh, why?
as she takes time just for MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
GGgala: Perhaps...
The moon...is the oldest object orbiting the earth
See I got that off the top of my head
He was there
Could be older asteroids out there.
They don't orbit the earth.
some do
Comets at least.
No comets do.
well not comets i guess
lol Twi's face
10yeah I suppose
Ooh,and here is a picture of some moonrock
I definitely like that idea
I have epic spelling yo
10if only to say 'let's go to the RD' room
especially considering we're going to be dealing with massive numbers
I don't remember that in the Bible :0
(INB4 you don't and think I'm an idiot)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VAMC_Goodwill_lunar_sample.jpg
Pouty Dash.
10I completely agree dari
YOUMADBRO?
10otherwise I'd be in all rooms anyway
rarity is mad.
6RainBro, we're trying to keep them all Pony related...
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/VAMC_Goodwill_lunar_sample.jpg
No "COME OUT" spam?
WOOHOO
If we get the domain I could probably have everything running by the end of tomorrow.
COME OUT
awwwwwwwwwww yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I'm surprised too, herospirit.
bad touch
yarp :0
11Ponyville
10I know, but I was just giving my opinion
there we go

6I'll do the domain when we're done with the meeting, dari.
my favourite ^_^
07everything...
07wow
The moon is the home of the clangers
Winter wrap up, winter wrap!
Also, shall we have a help channel?
Dumb mosquitos!
GGgala: Could it have anything to do with addblocker?
6-_-;
11So: Pony Theme Tab, A tab with Rooms and "Traffic lights", and a mane room.
07:D
*adblocker
Ahh.
YO BITCHES LAY DOWN A BEAT. It's time for the Winter RAP up!
11Nopony can be in more than one room at a time.
"toot" is fairly fulfilling
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN BBBEEEEEYYYY-EEEETCCH
11oh

I can't wait ^_^
Oh.

Luna whats wrong with 666?
Me neither
night Elky
6So we can have everything on one page.
6Silver, those banners are for the rooms.
GGgala: Yes, though I've had no problems with it before.
How do I screen cap?
Lol
i still dont see any problem with it
Although there's still a debate whether it's 666 or 616
I won a raffle with the ticket 666 :P
Ok.
11k
its actually a birthmark
DecapKing is the Antichrist
OH MAN, DAT 80's metal
613 I mean. I think
666 is 666 backwards
My technology classroom's # is 404

Shiggy: Lolwut

its definitely right

Ponies Ponies Ponies
6Wrek, you'll be making the themes once the banners are done, but that's a future thing... as it'll be a project.
Got a screencap of the 666 Pinkamena results.
GGgala: Yes, though I think it is an older version.
Ponies Ponies Ponies
Equestria Equestria Equestria
6I've thought a lot of this out... =/
PONIES ARE REAL
PONIES ARE REAL
Well,that doesn't work
PONIES ARE REAL
PONIES ARE REAL PONIES ARE REAL PONIES ARE REAL
Pinkie: eschatology is cool
yes they are.
MAAAARVEEEELLLLL
10i mentioned the teams/mods/admins :P
We need more WISHING power!
"real ponies are real
they live in fields and have a low intelligence.
Cool.
07I also have a thing
Nope,still doesn't work
GUISE DID YOU KNOW YOU AER WATCHING PONIES IN A STREAM?
6It's (tentatively) for Thursday, dari.
TIME TO GO TO BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
6We need to talk to the streamers.
/me falls asleep
live TV stream
Oh I remember.
of the Hub and other things
6It'll be a live TV stream.
Yeah, I liked that idea.
6Alright, the teams/mods/admins thing.
6It's purely for the sake of organization, for one.
buffer returns.
Yes
yes it does
Then whats applebloom?
solthas: huh. have you considered just using an IRC client?
07RP*
queen of country
Luna is the reason i dont get a hug cause 666 is on the bottom of my foot?
6The mods are well, chatroom mods.
Most of these are on musieums but one is missing
6That don't have to worry heavily about the craziness of organization and day-to-day tasks.
:O
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r509sR2TdFg&feature=related
i took it
Wiill you be the one t ofind it?

We need to restart our moon program.
I screencapped that image http://postimage.org/image/32g6g3gf8/
14Aww
agreed Nitanny_Tiger
lol
gah, mispely
11...
Only reason we're not going now is because we're broke and not in a race with anyone.
is something playing tonight?
10regularly*
10but ok
CASTLEVANIA BIRDS!
il
I heard it again!
Meh, I'm not bothered about not being included, opinions gunna opinionate. :P
6Everyone still has the same amount of say on subjects as everyone else.
6Dari... I just forgot to add you to the list. XD
6Because you really should be.
Of course, that was one war, not two.
Yeah probably
Night ponies, have a very pony night
ARHG i dont care about the moon
Ok.
later
No offense tho
Shush Gamer,you'll upset luna
Luna is off the moon aint she?
Luuuna
Still hers
It doesnt apply to her anymore
maybe she got homesick?
6Wrek'll probably get put on the list if he keeps up the good work.
Well living there for 1000 years, probably means she paid off the mortgage.
10I've never not been enthusiastic about it :P
6The more you try the further you'll go.
WOOT
The "Cheese" would kill you if you ate it
She knitted
she probably built a city maybe
bye robotpinkiw
Like eating sand,but worse
or a moon base!
14Yeah... I wish we could just all be equals...
lol
She posted ponies
14SOME of us dont get the chances to do more.
More like eating little bits of glass actually
6...come up with ideas and whatnot.
10I give input on a regular basis, just saying, like.
yehs
that reminds me- hobo with a shotgun- anyone seen it?
really, really gory though.
6You were told to forget about helping with the mane site?
reanimator gory?
6By whom?
14I can't remember now.
reanimator gory
14It was near the beginning of when I joined.
Quite gory.
Oh
6Nopony's input is ignored.
10after it being confirmed by more than one of you 'core important mods'
Nvm.
I haven't seen that other movie.
Anyway,more trivia about the moon
10So I've not put in enough input?
6We all ARE equals. Everypony's say matters just as equally as everypony else's.
ib4 20% cooler
Aand there it is.
07exactly
14I spose.
10I'm just puzzled, to a humongous extent
wow, no 20% cooler turbochat?
I'm surprised myself
tuuuuurrrrbbooooo
budget? it's free D:
2,14 meh, it's the post show plus not too many people online right now
10about why nopony seems to think I do anything around here
I havnt seen turbochat in a while actually
wow no 1spammed 20% cooler
Not even last night
10>nopony
10xD
6I think no such thing.
Her's a picture of all the different land marks on the side of the moon you can see
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Moon_names.svg
loloolololololoooolloollololoololo
10then why am I a lesser moderator?
2,14 plus, I like it when there's no spam :P
LMAO
/me reminisces back to last week's epic LOTR chats
lol
XD I knew someone would do that.
6Because you haven't expressed interest to help in day-to-day organization.
6That I know of.
10well I have
10there you go
/me saw it coming, still loves it.
snails is a genious.
/me 11is just here.
magic
Very well.
carefully
10I'm in a partial agreement, but that's probably emotional bias
Craterception
I don't think it's really helping us work together.
She plays them very well and very carefully.
Its 8:pm over here
uh, PM
its 7 pm here
. . .
07Actually there's a way to become involved.. some channels are not being used at the moment
a crater within a crater?
we need to go deeper...
14It just makes some of us feel less important or like we're not helpful enough. When we want to be more involved in the first place.

I was born then :D
Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth.
07more frequent contact with candidates
LUNA CONTROLS THE SEA
07sure
also, the ground rises and falls due to this tidal stress.
LUNA CONTROLS EVERYTINHG

The moon also regulates the rotation rate and spin axis of the earth.
i'll be on laterish

6I need to make a list on the forums of all the places we have groups and whatnot...
05that typign failed
Uh, is it post show right now?
10yeah the only one I don't read frequently is the forums
6There already is, Val.
and has storms on it
an imaged signature?
10frequently enough*
07there's a ton of things to pick up and manage
6Oh, imaged?
Instead of rotating like a spinning top,Uranus rotates like a rolling ball
6That would look nice.
Seriously what's going on right now?
well if you wanted I could start working on one
Uh oh.
the afterparty.
Nothing
Pretty much

I accidentally the Dash's face
Okay.
10Like, if there's one section which I should read, which is it?
Nyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyan
10Because I read a lot of it, and it all just seems to be dotted around
07newsletter / ideas /
07feedback /
Um...I don't see those sathi >.<
6>implying this isn't an old playlist
It does spin like a ball instead of like a top like most other planets though
Ti..

I forgot how faint Uranus' rings were
As you can see,Uranus is screwed up
Did you know that gas giants larger than Jupiter have been found to orbit their stars at strange locations relative to their parent star?
Like one as close as Mercury?
is to our sun?
Has unanimousdelivers done anything in the past few months?
WHY DO I KNOW IT.
well everyone I gotta go see ya
someone has a lot of time on his/her hands
This song?
07one moment
Chrono Trigger.
seey!
That would be why I know it

Ciao Applebloom.
bye Applebloom
That's nothing, one year on Pluto is about 216 years on Earth, isn't it?
yep
07We're gonna make a list
That "so" face freaks me out
07put it up on the forums
XD
*scrunch scrunch*
strangely close to their star nittany yes
or with elliptical orbits
07So that you all can get involved (if you want to)
Yep.
wow
compared to jupiter
07Alright?
07guys?
As in having gas giants far from their parent star is a special case.
05to me atleast
6I shall brb
We need more Ponified versions of TouHou music :P
07me too
made of litium
is this un owen?
lithium*
You are all quite strange....
proto-planet*
our sun absorbed it though
14Whats the site use as coding anyway? I've not done site coding or maintenance in a while now...

as you are the one that writes clopfics
10xD
Not java, javascript.
14HTML is easy... Java not sure if I've done enough. I guess I'd have to see it.
Our sun didn't absorb our moon... yet
hero XD
Didn't know that.
6Yeah, javascript... >>;
14:P
6Anyway, brb
Astronomy interests me a lot.
2,14 oh....what is this vid called again?
I haven't kept up with it since leaving Clemson.
Yeah? Well at least I write about relations between consenting ponies.
make that 5 million emmett
the male genome is dieing out
ok ok
scaring you all now ^_^
Yeah, as soon as 1 billion years
both acutally

y u no stream
it's going to go supernova soon
I like ponie
The sun won't explode.
/me knows they wouldn't die off just like that.
Oh dear.
It doesn't have enough mass.
I know, Barry.

13Secrets
13-.-
If we manage to NOT kill ourselves off by the time any of this happens, we'll probably be able to handle it. :0
alright?
you won't need a telescope to see it though. it'll be like a second sun.
13Consider this a threat
Damn.
The sun won't explode.
3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/596.png
YES IT IS, Barry.
MOAR SECRETS
Saturn interests me most of all
OH WOW
supernova*
"Or should we say, tanks"
yeah, but how much energy does it use? :P
yep.
and how easy is it to aim?
05enough to blot out the sun
"The ATL is intended to strike up to 100 targets in rapid succession"
That's how easy it is to aim.
13More?
We...are...having...a...pleasant...conversation
the future man....the future
05hmm dari, link?
Stars with masses 15 times greater than the sun have supernovas at the end of their lifespan.
6Buffer... buffer everywhere.
>future

13Are you sure that you want more Herospirit?

14Ehhh... lol
They are going to showcase the laser later this year.
2036 may be when one hits us D:
Everyone is fucked.
14I think we'll have viable time travel too at some point perhaps.
05thats how equestra was made?
10well, forwards, right?
14Technology is infinite.
10not backwards surely
(even if it is as cramped as the ISS though0
13*cough*
according to hawking
All of the secrets
Oh jeez, this song.
we'll most likely kill ourselves off in the end
10we're plateauing hard
travelling to the future is impossible
It won't explode.
I don't really feel like crying right now. =/
14Fuck Hawking lol

10valthejean I think it's travelling to the past that is impossible, not the future?
14He isnt the know all end all to everything. :P
Ok.
that or Aliens take over
Traveling to the future is possible.
?
Barry1: heavier metals.
10yeah
I swear he said it was.
err, sorry
14I think it may be evnetually.
I got that backwords
10xD <3
And I thought electrons did travel through time anyway?
But it is still burning
It's just hot from being the center of a star.
(MFW I talk about things I have no idea about)
Oi, we got two silly fillies in here. One talking about the sun, the other about the moon
13Hmmm
13Nah
Good night
lol'
14Though it stands to reason, why havent we see it in our past yet. Or maybe we have and just havent noticed.
astronomy fascinates all of mankind.
They disappear and reappear simultaneously in different places or something.
ahh this song.....
10dai they travel still at reasonable speeds
I wanna go to mars already damn it
and i just came
It is.
neutron stars are epic
wtf is in the background
Before we go to mars, we may colonize the Moon
Can I be a JRPG villain?
my favourite kind of stars ^_^
um, not really barry1.
Here it comes...
I need a sword larger than myself and either spikey or flowing hair
They abandoned the moon colonization program to concentrate on mars instead.
THE BEST AT PARTIES?
They want to skip one of the stairs's steps
And there it went.
the moon could be colonized though
10this is why I'm taking physics
Barry1, look at the pictures of the universe.
:P
10:D

What's that thing that behaves differently when it's observed and when it's not?
I'll show you Barry
lol
There's an X-ray shot of the universe around.
why does worst pony have best part?
Oh, that ^
who's worst pony?

ok
I chose physics, maths, chemistry, and further maths.
wormholes herospirit- possible or not?
http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/xallsky_rosat110.jpg
Possible, but unsafe
6Fuck yeah maths~
agreed
worst main pony
We'll see. XD
10I was livid
very dangerous to try to traverse wormholes
Worst feeling ever.

it's possible, if you do it right

10it was two thirds of a percent or something stupid
Pinkie Pie is pcool
But if we were to put a base on the moon, we could still use to I think it we'd just need to chemically alter it. Think there was to much H in it
i am best pet
15I really want to say I'd main Twilight, but she's not really my gameplay style....
doh
If you do it wrong, the whole thing collapses
7In all honesty, it'd be AppleJack
3Rainbow Dash
7I think she'd fit my fighting style best
10I can't do anything with it yet
3I got a connection here mind you
only millions of times worse
any ircops available to do a webirc ?
I read that somewhere.
3Being the element of loyalty myself and all...
15and Twilight's zoning, which is about as far from rush down as possible.
You can't throw matter into a wormhole.
you can't?
Maybe not even energy.
why not?
Also, wormholes tear you apart when you go in em
Don't know.
COUNFUND THEM
15I may end up as a RD player myself, as I'm assuming she'll have DEM AIR COMBOS
well we don't know that Nittany
Shortly after saying it stopped making me cry, I burst into tears at Twilight's verse.
anti matter rockets anyone?
everything is speculation
14Which is why I dont use FB, bleh lol
It's probably due to the stress matter puts on space-time.
It screws with the wormhole and collapses it.
i already have it configured in my ircd then upon reading more i noticed i was supose to talk to an ircop here to relay the info here
15xD
3C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER-EAKER-EAKER

That's just scary. XD
anyway- goodnight all :D
3Unless this has some relation to a certain fanfiction
I might go back to physics for my Ph.D.
7This channel is now Spiderman channel?
10oh yeah dari I made a coilgun as a project for my personal statement. Bitches loved my personal statement
Good night.
Possibly.
All we know about space-time is in Einstein's equations.
and you just need my server name and the webirc password right ?
Wut O_o

Ahh, the luxuries of being young and having parents pay for everything for you. :P

It's Valve
10also, I tend to only eat when I should eat anyway. Saves money, burns fat-> win/win
14Betch!
10dari my parents are shit-poor XD
10they're the ones that have no money atm
3Not really....
Plus mods.
14I'm only 100 pounds, if I loose anymore weight, there wont be anything left...
10I'm trying to live off them :<
Yeah, but I doubt my laptop's fast enough to get enough enjoyment from it
3But if we want to run on that theory
Also, they're porting over the L4D1 campaigns to L4D2
13>.>
7Actually, I had nothing to do with that
14You be a lightweight too.
...Whoops wrote out loud
05which still doesnt make sense to me
10but I've lost 24 pounds recently
not to mention it's too expensive right now, and I've already got a Wii on Layaway

Do people seriously play Valve games on consoles?
7mfw I couldn't give it back
I just want to play online.
10Wrek.. Is it bad I have a fanfic for that?
14Sounds hawt
Yep.
Blarglarg I'm off to the bathroom.
14I want in on that action.
05not really
7I just wanted to see if I could take it
The large ones at least.
14:P
A certain "Blizzard" comes to mind
Square is in my good books right now thanks to Deus Ex.
Well, I can understand playing Valve games on the PS3 since the online there is free last I checked.
14Is it bad I wont write fanfics?
14*dont
Denied. :(
But that was a recent development, wasn't it?
^ No
:P
10not really, although when I do read fanfic (which, recently, isn't often), it's only ever exclusively shipping
Some of it draconian (Ubisoft).

I can't believe Ubisoft wants to bring back Always-on DRM.
Since everyone hated it online.
*at first.
14Streaming guides?
And all games afterwards.
Until Ubisoft patched it out.
they did?
Yep.
Ubisoft doesn't care.
i uninstalled after i got annoyed with that
well not literally
but that is the next step
literal killing
05yesh
soap*
isn't there some way to get around that?
With piracy, yes
It did.
I mean, I don't condone piracy, but you could probably crack the DRM without resorting to theft.
10:3
LITTERAL KILLING,THEN RE-ANIMATION.
And Ubisoft never told anyone about it.
LOL
THEIR WORLD DOMINANCE SHALL SOON BE WITHIN GRASP

>=C
On a related note, I found the nicest beer I've ever had recently.
05who?
>implying I've tried that many beers
They did that years ago with AQ.
But still.
Bdat wasn't meh, it was my evil twin!!
come play, my lord
15pic*
Affligem beer.
6YOU'VE GOT MAIL
3Looks fine on my end
:0

Those monks have been working on it for 1000 years and they've got it RIGHT.
15There's nothing there to click for me

10meh, I don't like beer really
eeyup...ya saw frahday

DAT ENTER ¬¬
Yes I did Applejack :3
=D
They only have the Mane 6 confirmed
3X2 INGNORANCE COMBO!!!!
Then you clearly haven't tried this beer.
:P
and Twilight is cheap...
lol cheap
Is there a recording of the stream yet?
is it..
3*Headdesk*
she teleports and shoots a gigantic beamu
At least one of those is confirmed to be a non Pony.
3sjalf;haibo;ficoad;s
yes
6Alright dari, I registered it, but it'll apparently take a day to process.
3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/115.png
lemme guess, spike
also, Trixie
Ok.
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/fighting-is-magic-livestream-recording.html
We don't know. The Mane 6 is all that's confirmed.
there
the whole recordin
The fuck.
10well it's cider
... welp, I think I just had my world rocked.
3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/375.png
herospirit: She teleports, shoots gigantic beams, use "mines" and most of her attacks are long ranged...
I found out somebody hates the Derpy/Dinky fanon relationship.
10not even alcohol
4you really suck at posting pics DE
And 3 hits and she dies.
3!?
Not "is indifferent to" or "doesn't care about".
but if you close the distance you can completely fuck her shit up :3
Actually hates it.
3All my pics are coming up Decap
Denied_existence, yfw no longer ignored
while her only competition has been Applejack - an in-your-face fighter
what's p?
up*?
3None of them are links
spike basically is a main character
Rarity can probably do both
7RainbroDash yfw you're not hidden
4they dont show up at all
remember the bitchslap move?
ye
10and significantly more manly
xD
>manly
>children's drink
:P
/me has no idea how E_N can see him
05i passed otu for a minute there
05ohai
3IDK
D_E I can't really comment
Lol :3
14lol :P
xD
I don't know what's in her head, and it's not my place to criticise
3I didn't think you could
no, I mean on a personal level
adnasdfn
Anyone jumps at her, they'll likely die
and also E_N don't speculate
<3
similar to Twilight's book
3E_N also cause I'm kinda eccentric
10yes dari, exactly
/me brohoofs Applejack
10more manly
10scrub
Yeah, that makes more sense
basically, D_E was just a little bit trigger-happy and a tad loopy
I want to see the CMC as one character
pah.
Three little fillies ganging up to fight off the older girls
14Wrek I know that feel
3He's pretty sad, but I can't tell you why. Patient confidentiality you know.
answer MADIC!
MAGIC
i don't get it...why they call emo Pinkie, Pinkamena?
Pinkamena is part of Pinkie's full name...
3Good
when her default mood was emo-Pinkie
And she was all ):
3He doesn't want people bugging him about it anyway
i would be a playable character, but i chose to be a lover, not a fighter
well pinkamena is her actual name
exatly..
fun fact: fluttershy is into bdsm
THAT BOY NEEDS THERAPY.
http://i.imgur.com/rrVTa.gif
stay the fuck away from her
she calls herself Pinkie cuz it's shorter i guess =P
like*
brb
She would likely use Angel
yeah, because they're tested for a while
and summon little friends to help
Animals
lots of animals
to see if they can hold their own
playlist over, wanna watch gic?
her STARE HAS TO BE A MOVE!
D_E is a prime example of this, he needs some tweaking :)
Animals for specials, Angel for her regular attacks
Is the streamer online? :0
6Why does this playlist keep turning shuffle off?
eheh... itt lv3-super speculations
3I trust him completely
damn songs stuck in my head.
E_N
7and Dari
7and most mods
Trixie would probably be close-range control
as well as Anti-air
Trixie's level 3 would be smoke and mirrors, totally
3Also Dari, those angels were fucking creepy.
Heheh.
Dem angels.
No, her Level 3 would be her Stage
4there were angels?
:)
give her time...
/me is now Away
11
And then there may be more
as they think of more
I have a strange habit of calling Lvl ones "supers" and Lvl threes "ultras"
Hey D_E.
meh, do something else then :P
YFW this gif: http://i570.photobucket.com/albums/ss148/emmzlife/Doctor%20Who/Angels.gif
15:0
probably Dash's Level 3
brb
>three times
3Oh gosh
4whats creepy about that?
O_o
D_E, PM
7Oui, zat is correct madam
Dat_Pon-3: it was that bar at the bottom
We're talking about Fighting is Magic at the moment :0
as to when - no word
THERE IS TOO A WORD
"soon"
They used it every single time someone asked :P
can we just watch gic? :P
I think it's just a playlist set to random
no idea
0_o
GIC?
hello random Queen
7desemsitization is always good
I really want the main music them from "Frontier Psychiatrist" seperated from the rest
LOL

I'm genuinely dumbfounded.
but used much more jokingly of course
13Basically its not even showing in the list of installed programs
13Any idea how I can fix it?
No idea outside of pirating, Pinkie. Sorry. =/

14That anime girl on the far left kinda reminds me of a character from Rozen Miaden.
6Really good Arcade Shooter
14Ah. Never played it.
DeathSmiles? What's it for?
6You can find it for Xbox.

Just once, i'd like to join one of these streams, and have the events make sense.

They give you a few templates, you make at least two of the portraits they need and send them in. The best part?
Like a boss?
Really?
13...
Like a LAGGY INTERNETS.
Due to streaming.
13I think Operation Anchorage is missing
LOL

It needs to be done.

Ramming into other cars wasn't really...effective in Hot Pursuit as a Racer, and that was a bit of a letdown
i did for a little bit
Did at one point
Yeah, ramming as a Racer was pointless
as its main point

...I think he left.
Probably just jonesin' for pony, I'd guess
hes one of those overdramatic preteens
13^
lol most likely
:D
It's weird, the whole community aspect of ponies came after, for me.
Hey Turtaguin
if you havn't figured it out by now i was prinncess
and I'm pretty sure everypony is still alive.
13Made me lawl
Prnicess______
Too much GTA4 for me!
13Ahh, okay Turt. You were clever too. :P
they shuold make gtaPonies
I think I need to request a Password Reset for AndySQdancer and don't know how--password was changed when they hacked into the server and I never got it changed successfully.
hey, i just found $25 in my pocket, score!
13GTA pony edition would be... interesting
13Thats hawt Turt
Those $80 quickly turned into ponies, though...
lmao
lol not quite
aww
13lol Turt XD
Haha
13Alfalfa :P
lmao
fucking roll that shit!
13DOH HO HO
6I'm an... Alfalfa... monster. =D
duddenly, alfalfa
suddenly*
YES YES YES YES
With a Link pony who's a unicorn
and zelda is celestia
awesome!
I'm lazy and busy though, but eh...
kokiri can be earth ponies i guess
Easy to spot a non-kokiri, then
yeah
gerudo can be pegasi
I guess Unicorns would be Hylians... that'd work
and hyrulians unicorns
hylians*
alicorns?
lmao
sure
lol Gorons could be buffalo, perhaps
maye gorons could be male ponies?
buffalo
that works
ohwait, the sheikah could be zebras, of course
yes!
/me writes this down
...not sure.
Hmmm
sheikas could be unicorns
nah, i like the idea of sheikah zebras
this could really work
Would be a ton of work though...
definately, but if we sell it we would make sooo much money
lol that might be getting a bit ahead of ourselves
also little girls too
Which nick?
brb, the chocolate milk, it calls me
Pegasi would serve a pretty Rito-like role, really.
yeah
yuo have to awake the mane six
yeah
I dunno, I might make some proof of concept thing either way, but I know people are already working on Zelda-like pony games
business*
lol I don't think that would work
why not?
No way a hobbyist could do that
lol I don't think it could get that far, even :P
stores*
Just making a proof of concept thing is a lot of work, but I need to do something like that for school fairly soon either way.
yeah
if we decide to see this thing through we are making a huge commitment of free time
Haha, like I said, I doubt that could happen
you never know, shoot for the stars
or the moon, in this case
I'd need to have a lot of people smarter than me help me out
wait, i just thought of something
since its a cpoy of legend of zelda, we would also need intedo's permission...
or at least them being the size they are I would assume they would
Not really, no...
There are plenty of action RPGs out there
yes but if we use the name link and zelda, we would most definate;y get sued
I wouldn't use any names if I tried...
lol
Any owned names, I mean.
yeah, ik
Got the map code mostly done and very nice Zelda 1 like screen transitions
we can think on it, but we do need to decide
lol right now I can't do anything, I work and study
yeh, it wouls have to be a summer or 2 long projecgt
Id like to talk about this agin sometime
alright, night Turtaguin
night!

how DID that happen anyway?
I car-jacked a cab to get back here.
of course. it all makes sense now.
and you survived.

yes
but i have gone to a channel frequently and someone is always logged in as owner/op but is not there
I dont remember.
Pinkamena is in my blocked users list.
it allows you, the channel owner, to set others to be automatically voiced, halfop'd, or op'd

Actually, I guess those would be a bit too large.
Plus they have protection them
To large?

You can zoom in on them twice
Besides, they said they would release them later
Besides
I would need portrait sprites, fighting sprites.. ect

Terribly, boringly mediocre
