12helloooo
Wrek: wut r u talking abut lol
Not sure if sarcasm....
lol
is he kidding us?
not sure
hai lati
I think its becuz i didnt say anything after "Wait...." :'(
we've been linking youtube, so...
and hope your area is ok Rukario ;(
12hiya! :D
12o.o
05implyign i read caht when drawing
lkj
it's all ur fault RaveBrony, lol jk
D:
boooooring
Lil_B: It still sounds nice. What I'm afraid of is that in the Czech dubbing the names will be translated too. I don't know if you know even a little of czech language but it would sound horrible.
:/
one does not simply get bored in bronystate
Refreshed the whole page no stream D:
nnnnnope
Malavolent also, Sweete bells version of "Hush Hush" in the german version sounds awesome, but i think thats also because the Cutemark Crusaderas have adult voiceactors http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Wp0Y4Asr4
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4926/
Refreshed, pressed play, and still nothing (If it helps)
((Why is everypony talking like there's a stream?))
/me zzz
idk
just the buffer show for me
lol Michael
Litwick: I think Wrek is trying to stream, but im not sure >.<
just gotta get through 1 hour...
yay for new toys
i just see the adventures of the buffering circle
There was a second I thought there was stream, but nope
Lil_B: That is pretty neat.
This is the most beautiful spinning circle you've done, Wrek. It looks almost as if it's moving
Malavolent I know what you mean, in the Preview trailer of the dub they had some names Translated and it sounded horrible
cachi01: Oh man, I love that show!
whats it doing today cachi01
cachi01: eh, it got boring after the first 3 seasons
Look at the buffer go!
:D
FillyFlam MahBoi777 xD alexxm he is doing the usual rolling till he gets tired lol
Lil_B: Something like RoseKuchen? :D
the buffer is chasing its tail
G1 buffering was better
lol
Oh man, again? I think he's addicted.
05i like the lack of "stream died" yells when it happened then
we are broffers!
Lil_B: or RosenKuchen? I haven't practiced my German for some time.
Dat compliment
Hmmm? Oh...
I haven't seen any stream since I walked in
bro + buffer = broffers
since 14:17 actually
lol cachi01
/me bursts into flames and explodes
i c wat u did thar
05youve missed aprox 30 minutes of art and pink floyd then
05cause no one told me
ohhhh. ok wrek
lol
Dayum shame.
Malavolent the one I remember was that they translated "The Mare in the Moon" to "Die Stute im Mond" it's true that it's 100% accurate translation, but it stull sounds so wrong
Best Bruffer Friends Forever
hey
Damn it! >.<
Wrek: stream be down
Ive only been here for 10 minutes tho D:
:'(
Wrek: I'd just assumed you'd stopped. I was too busy elsewhere. :D
Who will be streaming next then?
everyday i'm buffering
Lil_B: As long as they don't translate pony names, it's quite okay.
I assumed it was just me
/me dances
Morning all
hai XAX
i lurk... i dont watch the stream much anymore...
Lil_B: lol sounds like die slut im monds!
/me is not ok with this
mornin XAX!
Moin XAX
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
Hello XAX! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
how are ya?
RaveBrony: you'll be alrigth.
Hey XAX!!

/me backhands mips.
Wrek: Oh, alright then. Just needed this to be cleared up to me.
WAIT best part is coming
TheRainbowDash: Ive been awake for a whole... 5 minutes syne
:J
XAX: Good 5 minutes since?:D
just youtubing atm
5 minutes maybe*
what do you do at work?
10I hate when BNC is down
real pros don't need bouncers
Eh.
Malavolent I'm just happy that they just didn't tranlated some Names, but I'm still pissed at some Translations of songs... I don't like Winter Wrap up, but it didn't hat to get butchered like this :/
My throat is killing me, but other than that, I guess.
ouch
Lil_B: It's pretty hard to translate it right, though. I'm afraid of our translation of song, but we usually translate foreign songs pretty well.
IT support for now
05sorting the problem
Lil_B: For example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6I9LkXS4uQ
10I can't leave my laptop on 24/7
12instead they have cows
I just started last week

Bronysith: Holla! :)
Oh hai Bronysith

Malavolent That song sounds awesome in ALL languages : D

Bronysith: Oh, cool.
/me hugs TheRainbowDash

/me hugs TheRainbowDash back
Lil_B: I still like it most in Czech and German (where it is singed by cold voiced singers) :D

05so*

who's this group?
GilDash: lazars :D
lol...howd you get the job then?
it's a lot better than my old job though
Whats this?
/me slaps panda.
05i jsut said
hey panda!
:(
AHHH deja vu how i hate u
Bronysith: I know that feel
Wow, this is an experience.
I'm a CS major; it's not like I know nothing about computers and IT
My stream still doesn't work.
It just takes a while to get used to this particular system
What is this, a Deadmou5 concert? Theres lazers all over the fuckin place.
Malavolent: hit the magic refresh buttton
ALL the colors @_@
05this is 1994
Thorn: way better. a pink floyd concert
cachi01: That was the first thing I've done :|
05deadmasu was probably still in diapers
ahh
like I don't know everything about how the school's software works, stuff like that
Malavolent: lol click play
I originally wantd to be a CS major
it's an on-campus summer job
deadmou5? seriously?... that just saddens me that people dont recognize pink floyd...
there's not really an application process
Ok, refreshing helped.
10Yes
panda: Don't steal my lazer bit ite
10Scan through them
Midnight_Tempest: ikr :(
I ended up changing cause there was just nothing where I live for computer job seekers
10Read offline PMs
/me slaps Om.
Its a joke.
oh, really?
Malavolent I'm really waiting for the dub of season 2, The writing and acting is better then in Season 1 and I'm really interested if they can keep the quality
Wrek: You like Pink Floyd?
Inb4 I'm the Seapony of heavy lifting
/me regrests nothing
Deadmou5 uses a lot of lazers.
where do you live, if you don't mind me asking?
lol
Pink Floyd FTW
Thats why I said it.
05the only and I mean ONLY good part of the swedish dub of S1 was soarins appel pie
CS is needed pretty much everywhere I thought
/me waits for the lift command
05the rest is utter shit
people now a day see a kiss concert and they thnk its freaking lady gaga
that's obsessive lol
the audience must have sunglasses
And Spitfire.
Hellooo !! Bronystatee !!! long time no seen !! ^.^
cachi01: dont make me cry.
Wrek: Saw that on YouTube :D
Lil_B: Well I've got exactly 1 week until the release of Czech dub.
great... my eye is beginning to become blurry again... fffffffuuuuuuuuu
hai Icy
Oh hai Icy
hi Icy.
Wrek: I do not need to be reminded of stupid sexy Swedish Spitfire. >_<
hi Icy
hey Icy!
hi Icy
hi Icy!
For the B movie, can it be toy storryyyy? :3
Midnight_Tempest, go to bed, and make sure the air in your room is hydrated
also drink water
Thorn: No way. Toy Story is an A movie.
05and actually contains oxygen
DuskStarshimmer: i woke up a couple hours ago...
aww.
toy story is a freaking super mega duper A movie
Midnight_Tempest, then its probably dry air
cachi01: Exactly. :)
or general sleep deprivation
Well, how about the biggest tea party
Lil_B: Oh, a correction, they will air Czech episodes starting on 11th July. They plan to translate Pound puppies too. But god, they've written My Little Ponny.
I live in California
DuskStarshimmer: maybe... but why is only one doing it and not the other... that makes no sense
05this ligthshow<33333333333
THAT would be a b movie.
i think thats a B movie Thorn
must be seen from spaaaaace
When I was trying to find work I was told that if I wanted to continue with my major I would have to relocate to find work
Midnight_Tempest, *shurgs*
WHISTLRS
Lookat all dem lazers!
I don't even let it log anything because I wouldn't read it anyway
*whistles while moving head*
aka lazy 5ever
So what are you doing now instead?
10No. I like to know what was going on while I was away.
/me applauds
Malavolent I'm also interrested in the choices they will make for the voices... Discord for example... The guy who voiced Q in Star Treck was a brilliand fit, his voice was freaking amazing for this kind of stuff and very fitting for Discord, but he died 3 yeahrs ago
cant see s##t
so beautiful
Annoying, aint it? *whisles*
so I was looking for an alternative, found out they are building a prison in my city and they will be hiring a bunch of medical professionals
Lil_B: No, John De Lancie is very much alive and well. :D
im planning on getting a rozio game capture card is it worth it?
lol
Lil_B: Germans surely have someone, who has Discord like voice :)
DISCORD IN A RED SHIRT.
That probably sounds bad but its a prison/mental facility
I CAN JUST FUCKING PICTURE IT.
X3
heh
GilDash I was speaking about the german Voiceactor for Q XD
Hey everypony! I'm back!
05love that lightshow
hai Biglaw
hey Biglaw!
Lil_B: Oh, sorry. :D
Welcome back Biglaw! (waves and hugs)
hi Biglaw!
DISCORD. REDSHIRT. STAH TREK.
:O
Damn!! Love the pic Wrek!
dat pic
/me cheers like a crowd
:o
yeah, we usually talk about you behind your back
/me hugs TheRainbowDash back
I started uploading a 600mb video to YouTube last night at 11ish. It's 7:54am now and it's 57% done
anypony here went to the iron maiden somewhere back in time concert???
Love my Internet
it was freaking amazing
So since last year ive been working on it, most of the CS classes I took couldnt be used for medical so I really got set back :/
amazing pic
whoa awesome pic
i want a red shirt with discord in a red shirt
05horrible quality
dat plot.
and there was this eddie robot
it was AMAZING
ah, that sucks
05much better
PLAY A MY LITTLE PONY SONG.
dem dire straits
don't ask for ponies
Thorn NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
<3
Thorn: dont make demands.
PFFT Thorn first u will have metal then u will have ponies
Before I entered college everyone told me I'd have plenty of time to decide on a major and if I wanted to change it 25 times it would be no problem
And then STAH FOX.
catchy tune
Thorn: Careful what u wish for
indeed
cause you might get what you ask for, not what you want.
and how many times did you change?
I don't see why because that is totally not true =/
With discord as peppy.
Wrek: Woah, how long have you been working on this piece of art so far?
:D
^
never
10Totally
05so far..
05looking to 18 hours
wow
unless you can count originally being "undecided"
Wow, 18 hours? Geez man....
DO A BARREL ROLL.
thats a lot of work
I could see them saying you could change but all it does is set you back another year/2 years
nah
press Z or R twice!
/me eats a burrito supreme and a chicken supreme in a car thats supreme
Mfw Wrek can complete a masterpiece in the time it takes me to draw a decent eye >.> rofl
I was undecided when I first went into college
/me does a barrel roll
How the hell did you do that Wrek :D dat tail is awesome
Wrek: Well, 18 hours well spent. It looks astounding.:)
BAAARRREEEELLLL ROOOLL
amazing
RaveBrony Wrek is a boss
^ indeed
MLP FiM dubbing hall of shame: http://youtu.be/lz6uYZV5tYY
Thron are you playing star fox?
....
nnope.
Starfox... I played that on the SNES <3
One of my friends was a chemistry major for two years and decided he didn't like it
I need to learn how to do that shine thing he does.... well, first i need the program he uses :D
love Starfox.
So he switched to CS
hey Biglaw
05time i could have spent making sure i graduate
/me likes watching
05but fuck it, drawing ponies :P
Hey Bronysith, hows it going?
LOL
Wrek: :D
Wrek /)
/me likes watching Wrek draw :3
Wrek: disreguard education post ponies
Wrek: /)
Wrek: Draw ponies, sell ponies, profit.
dunno
he's going to graduate with my class because the professors gave him special permission to take classes before he had the prerequisites for them
I'm sure hed have an easier time finding work as a chem major
haters gonna hate
I don't quite understand the point of that
Wrek who knows, you could make money selling prints on dA
Then Hasbor takes your ass down Malavolent
BECOME A PONY
*Hasbro
Hasbor!
I don't think so; like I said, CS is needed everywhere
yay
Draw Hasbro, sell Hasbro, go to jail.
Lol Hasbor
wtf
if it's important, you'll hear about it later
pretty much every company has at least a small IT department
Hasbor the mortal enemy of Sumerpan
http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/05/24/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ponify-all-the-cards/ make it happen :P
if it's just talk, it's not like you can join the conversation
and if you absolutely can't find work for someone, you can work for yourself as a freelancer
OmegaMetroidBrony: LOL:D
that's probably what I'm going to do
:3
I dunno, I just dont get leaving a computer on just for that
flutter_spin: they still lose to flashhulk.
Meanwhile, I turned off the video volume.
:D
Wrek http://i.qkme.me/36f4am.jpg
I'm willing to relocate after I graduate, though... so that helps my chances a bit
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: *cheers* How did you know he was?:D
I dont know if discord is cute in the card...
morning all
I REALLY DONT KNOW.
Oh hai Alicorn_Prince_Shane

OmegaMetroidBrony: nonsense, I can quit anytime I want:D
I have an anti-brony friend.

OmegaMetroidBrony: Pegasister is not a term.
OmegaMetroidBrony: Nice job!
Memme are you german?

Closet brony Biglaw?
Lil_B: Nope.
05tail is fianlly done
OmegaMetroidBrony probably.

Looks good, Wrek :3
i almost get a friend to turn into a brony
great Wrek
ooh
Wrek, Me Hoofsta! Two hooves up!
Wrek: It looks much better now she's leaning on something. :)
Wrek: Is it normal that I still dont see the stream?
he admits he likes the show and that its funny
looking good Wrek :)
Memme ok, i just thought because a "Memme" in germany is a weakling XD
Wrek: Looks good.
/me gives Wrek a sleeping Twilight filly for all of his hard work
is Wrek drawing this?
GOOD MUSIC!
Lil_B: LOL

See ya later RaveBrony.
I'm also kind of workin on my other friends.
Blowdown: yeah, its...not good.

WallDives: Give 'em time... ;)
GilDash!
Irish_Pony: Hello, Irish. ;)
Oh hey ZappyTheUnicorn i didnt see ya there! :D but yes, to portal 2!
to make it even worse, Applejack and applebloom had no accent whatsoever
Wait what....
RaveBrony: :D
I would like to get someone to see it, but I'm not forcing anybody, plus this really isn't a "thing" various people know about, nobody here has ever heard about MLP (other then the Toys)
Dis music :D
NEVER watch dubs to other languages.
It will make you puke.
ok
take your word
NEVER.
05italian intro is the exception that makes the rule
Memme: im mexican and the mexican dub is pretty good check it out :)
swedish spitfire, too
oh myyyyyy
True dat Wrek
Italian intro is swaggin
italian intro....has my respects its the best intro ever
SWEDEN!
I don't like the Swedish one.
But I haven't watched them all.
05note that he said spitfire Memme
Yea, I haven't heard it.
I'm actually amused by any language I do not speak, so I'm biased
i can somewhat understand the italian intro
gotta go dinner
DINNER
Agghh! I don't need to hear about Swedish Spitfire!
Michael: Bye.
is the italian intro on yt?
Get dem noms Michael
italian is kinda like spanish so i can understand it a little
i dont get it ZOMBIE! Oh /.m,a./fsdaj
Gonna check swedish Spitfire out.
Brb.
ef]eC>X
Blowdown: yep its in sethisto's channel
lol Memme
well,the german version had also no accent for anyone, but when you just don't have such a "country" Style of accent in you country, then there is no point in emulating it, it will just confuse the kids
Wrek: you must make things so detailed dont you :P
sadly though, the dutch have a country accent
Evening everypony
Irish_Pony: It's all in the details. :)

TheRainbowDash last year, we had to go all the way to the 30th
/me has 2 weeks plus 3 days of school left
Not like I could do better...
I know someone who did that; apparently you can charge ridiculous rates and people will actually pay them
05no, i encourage it
who would critize this?
Apparently meepsheep is in #brony
56 missed messages on tumblr whaaaa
Biglaw: My school year offically ends on the 8th of June.

TheRainbowDash you lucky filly you

Wrek: thats what we call constructive criticsim :P
Airpuff: Grimaces are always bad... :(
Wrek what band is that?
/me kisses Airpuff on the cheek.

Bronysith: Buried was good, a good movie for chat talking purposes, 8/10.
Nabronyan: Wrek is streaming, you may need to refresh.
/me steals the 5 million money

No sarcasm was intended to be in that sentence
We're okay with users talking about it, but if it gets too crazy or we start hearing complaints or anything questionable, we'll start paying more attention to the channel. That said, the premise is probably okay.
Not one syrupy drop of it.
hi guys
it'll be discussing different sorts of drugs, and users' experiences
Ever since I got into spyro ive been picking up any spyro stuff if I find it cheap enough
Heya diddutz

LordCelestia :O
02ah
Not really. Just abide by the TOS and be mindful of the fact that we do permit users 13 and older to use the network (presumably with adult supervision if that young). Like I said, if things do get out of hand, we may ask you to hide the channel (+s) or close it entirely. It's a controversial topic. But we are not fans of censorship.
hai LordCelestia
okay, don't tell us, I can't be trusted
k ur majesty
trust me
02I thought that was the better one
Invi: I know it's no use trying to fall asleep when I'm bickering
LordCelestia: In mane chat? Sure...:D

Hello Shizuka! (waves and hugs) How are you today?:)
guys did you know that uring the early 1990s, Nintendo employees were obliged to let doctors remove the Sonic Hedgehog gene (yeah there is a gene called sonic hedgehog) from chromosome 7 with chemical therapy. As consequence, many employee offsprings were born with green pigment and outsize tongue.
oh you wont believe the stuff Ive got then
13busy
hai Shizuka
Dora the explorer is more retarded than derpy >.>
they were the inspiration for yoshi...
and they are dead

...so there was this guy who liked his girl very much. but he wanted to do something special for his proposal. so he forged her a ring. from a meteorite http://izismile.com/2012/05/15/home_made_wedding_ring_forged_out_of_a_meteorite_45_pics.html
Why not Shizui?

Ive got a nintendo promo letter that was given out to some people on their mailing list

forge her a SWORD
Oh wait, I do have a copy of Blue, but I don't trust it since it deleted my save
i rarely download stuff so :P
Meteorite ring? damn that has to be worth a wedding
13redesigning a site of mine
LordCelestia and RainBroDash: You two are terrible people and you should feel terrible.
cachi01: Today, I learned that yes, you can fight over an open window.
Dark_Horst Now thats MANLY AS FUCK!
the envelope had silver/gold artwork all over it
I don't want any food.
would be kinda hard to find enough ore for a sword, me thinks
would it be a power ring Dark_Horst
The Pirate Bay, the most notorious online haven for copyrighted content, came in at an unimpressive 13th place, with 10,245 requests for takedowns of links to the site.
icybeauti: :D

Michael: D'awww
Hi
another question crossed my mind
Michael: Pinkie s fluffee
scenario:
Kipkat07_Mare: hrm, general issue then is that your file is corrupted, remove and reinstall
>person A has done drug X
>is willing to try it again
Wrek: She's beautiful. A really good job, mate. :)
IKR
is it ok to recommend them an activity?
brb
Spyro Orange gba
great job Wrek
thats it lol
Dat awesomeness.
WE'RE FREE
and they made the same game and bundled it with another
Wrek: Id you don't mind my asking, how long did it take for you to reach that level of skill?
Byootifull!
i think discussion about drugs is prohibited by ToS... right?
SO BEAUTIFUL
ha! first to comment!
awesome... oh, the back rounds
I got clearance for limited discussion =]
Not explicitly
I mean, not that...its good that I commented first...
0512 years of drawing, 1 year of drawing ponies
I feel really bad for saying it, but I really don't like it much :|
the channel topic is: Everything drug-related | NO selling/buying, it will result in a ban | Don't encourage people to use a certain drug (e.g. "this shit is nice, you should have some")
05thats right
excuse me for the language in the last part :3
>You may not promote information that you know is false or misleading or promotes illegal activities or conduct that is defamatory or libelous.
Wrek: Huh, I wouldn't be getting there any time soon then. :D Still, a really good job, Wrek. :)
Encouraging illegal activity is not allowed. Just stick to that.
05my 1 year bronydom anniversary is in 3weeks...
05:3
:D
I've already had mine back in Feb.
/me hugs GilDash
yeah, that would be the easiest thing to do
back again
Ok Wrek do you want us to get you a cake with a surprise in the middle?
/me hugs alexxm.
mines some time in august
Self Improvement!
I've only been a brony since... midway season 2
so it's not ok to recommend them to do X while on a certain drug, while they're willing to try it again without having that information prior to their decision?
05right now i want a painkiller and some music before i go to bed
mine is till march next year lol
Oh my god, that background..:)
Go to sleep Wreky <3
Winter Wrap Up was the most recent episode when I got into the show.
Ah, you finished it while I wasn't looking.
Ah, see you later then Wrek. (waves and hugs)
aren't you acting against your own rule there?
05not yet
Wreky, its bed time for you.
Wrek: Thats quite the accomplishment. And superb drawing as always sir.
I became a brony the week after Secret to my Excess
I'm going to try League of Legends one more time >.<
i became a brony sometime in august
/me saves the Wrek picture :D
hey look guys.
me
for now, I see it as being "don't tell people who've never used drug X before to use drug X"
I found it weird at first... first ep watched being sweet and elite
D:
FlareChaser|Octavia: are you any good at it?
i became a brony after Lesson Zero
Blowdown: I dunno.
do you.. have an elo?:D
wat
encouraging to take a drug at all is encouraging illegal activies, i think
FLARE REMINDED ME OF ANOTHER FUN FACT the league of legends champion is called varus and he is an archer. varus is also the name of a deformity in the knee!!! COINCIDENCE?
that's like a skill level in ranked games
cachi01: Skyrim ref? :D
cachi01: he's an hitman using a gun.. not an archer

Kid_Cobalt: By all means go ahead! Im always looking for more art of my OC :P
Woodenfan: this is fantasy... they have elevators... why not moon cannons?
In Silver's defense, he breaks the game and throws you up there.
NOW brush her hair?
Creepy

Fuck off I'd have stabbed her with damn fork at this point.
GilDash: Oy, you really can put everything into the gutter eh?
Lol??
You just said you didn't want your hair brushed! >_<
I thought they'd have lesbian romance
Irish_Pony: may i comment on your picture? =O
Om: I can give it a bloody good go. :)

Shit or ship?
i would stab her with a spoon
Irish_Pony: He will be in the same genral pose. Just sketched...and slightly modified.

I just realized: I'm the minority in a lot of situations: for example: Rarity's my second favorite pony, while everyone else ignores her.
Wait, is this show

Firaga: DISCOVERY KIDS Y U NO EVOLVE INTO HUB
Canadian_Brony: not really, they only air it at 10 am on weekdays
I saw a panty shot there =P
Firaga I see

Canadian_Brony: O_o into nickelodeon? but why?
Sphycopathic? Don't you mean telepathic? I know what I said!
00,10dat glare
not for me, cable provider gets hub, but my parents won't get the channel. Not a big deal, since MLP is the only show I'd watch.

cachi01 I heard you're hiding from Rainbow Dash...
Bronysith: probaly controling the night
Airbenders, culturally, were a monastic order, and thus for the most part males kept their heads shaven.
