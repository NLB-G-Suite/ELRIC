thanks =]
how?
do anyone knows where to find a relyable amc livestream for the 5th season of Breaking Bad?
I never had that problem with mine
because when I got my first one I was like 10 and my brother was 8 and we didn't know how to take care of disks
ohh
Just keep in mind it is a dubious topic on any IRC network.
I threw out all the boxes the games came in when I was little
I know
:P
and we just bought a boxed set of all three
/me is now alone in home
I regret it now cause I'm looking for them and they cost a lot

durfsupercenter
02which one?

the demo mode one
0,5Listen to my plan of secrets
02ah
Not really. Just abide by the TOS and be mindful of the fact that we do permit users 13 and older to use the network (presumably with adult supervision if that young). Like I said, if things do get out of hand, we may ask you to hide the channel (+s) or close it entirely. It's a controversial topic. But we are not fans of censorship.
okay, don't tell us, I can't be trusted
k ur majesty
trust me
A plan of secrets...Yeah I can't keep secrets :D
what's top left?
0,5Dont ask why

I bought it years ago, it was real cheap at the time
top right, is that the poster that came with Season of Ice?
02fine, I won't call you durf
As long as you aren't encouraging illegal drug use, since that /would/ be a violation of the TOS.
/me is a Jose :(
02instead I'll just call you durfy
lol
#define encouraging for me
02:3
I dont know where that poster came from
oops
wrong one
0,5So remember
"you should try that, that shit is awesome"
lol
it looks exactly like the poster I have
is it a bet?
0,5"dont call my name alejandro"
where did you get it?
They should paly the song as a joke
changed channel topic accordingly
-_-
0,5Maybe maybe not >:3
05YES
