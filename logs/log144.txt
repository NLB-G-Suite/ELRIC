Shrubbery.
Nuff said.
To make it easy, make them standing up and then turn them (what looks to me like) 45 degrees to fit with the cursor
I'm adding wings TO the cursor.
animating on a 45 deg angle has too be a bitch
Back.
Thanks
I had the shittiest day at school today.
Except custom pony cursors with custom animation based off of everypony's character would take years and artistic talent.
On my schedule, anyway.
A day ago, I sprained my wrist, I got sent home
:(
:(
And i went back to school after that day
Why am I reading the B'awwwww thread?
I cant cary shit
Cause its my right arm
My right arm=Strong arm
My belt was hanging out
If I lost my right arm....
I... oh lord.
My shirt tail was dangling
My pants were hanging
I looked like a mess
o.e
I dont know why.
i refuse to read fanfics
A friend of mine sent me there.
busy tryig not to cry here sorry
I read the first piece
I just left it
Like I said
i was like.."This shit is fucked up"
Tears, everywhere.
I was sent to the infirmary because some kid gave me an "Armshock" by putting his knuckle in my elbow
Thats not why it was sprained
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgkrBTryVCfmAARA5ZCMTY4nTa2ta2-mhmdpxvipEoA/edit?hl=en&pli=1#
wow
that kids a douche
I had the shittiest day. Period.
He is too.
i'm sure some of hte fics are amazingly well written but i just don't like playing with the characters that much outside of the show.
also, do you have a cast?
i did give everyone that link to all the sad fics rigt? http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/436613.html#436613
I know.
And when i got that armshock
I felt it in my wrist
REad the alternate endings to recover
It felt like i was being shocked in the wrist
I reposted anyway
damn
It's still sad, too
Theres always trixie
I mean, She only appeared in one appisode

I'll stick to bothering Fluttershy on her DA page
My DA page is a ghosttown
Mine has like 3 or 4 things on it
Mine has more deviations than comments.
Mine has a profile pic
if ghostbusters had guns it'd be called ghostbursters
Mine has 0 comments since I last checked
I'll give you some comments

Hey Luna

Oh man that EQD post seems EPIC
the ponies get trapped in dwarf fortress
MeteorVenture but would RD find winning fun
I mean lossing
:\
she wouldn't win either.. but she wouldn't lose
yeah but Dwarf Fortress' tag line is lossing is fun
i think the misspelled "fine"
"i'm this plan can't possibly fail.. losing is fine too"
x3
07,01>mfw reading EQD
07,01Oh yes yes yes yes !
07,01rumor...
close enough for me
Luna in a Halloween episode?
not going to get my hopes up until the tv listing is posted
....Isn't ep3 supposed to air on something like Oct22?
07,01well ep 3 is confirmed
07,01oct 15 >.<
I thought that E3 was on the 15th
NOOOOOOOO
in other words it's DEFINITELY a rumor
Tonight is the Wicker Man, right?
nah idk i'm just making puns

hello
I might try D&D one day.
Not today though ^_^
Oh, Luna, would you like to see the thing I made?

Did you like the picture?
07,01I like it yes
I thought it was pretty good but why aren't they sitting together?
Thanks, and I couldnt use too many ponies
And didn't want the theater to seem empty
I didn't think there was such a thing as too many ponies :P
I'm just wondering why the mane 6 aren't bunched together that's all.

and zoo,ing doesnt fix it

zoo,ing is something completely different

anyone know how to fix this?
stream is up?
not for me
err got disc
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh, did you guys see the episode 4 rumour?

we did
I'm about to cry
2,14 is any sidebar open? like bookmarks or history?

06,15My Tifa Lockheart Advent Children figure can't fit on a pony, due to her skirt-like thing. What's there to misunderstand? :P
there now that makes sense.

(shh spoilers)
lmfao pinkie
not everyone beat the first disc
Tifa cried for her. Also Twilight knew the other 5 only for a day, yet they were the best of friends
humans take longer to become friends
Stop taunting me with games I have never played but know are awesome!
D:
in the advent children parts
they went the same direction with lara croft
they don't have the poofiness
wai not
says whom?
says espy.
I did?
espy is invalid
It's a throwaway joke due to the Celestia toys.
More likely it'd turn everything she says into sounding like she was an evil tyrant. (the joke being on us)
also hello everypony

06,15You'd be surprised how many don't know about that movie, really.
Still waiting for Ghandi 2 to come out.
06,15lawl
The 'a' movie for saturday though...not sure if I'm that much of a masochist.
i agree
its even worse because I loved avatar the cartoon
^ I can do that :D
I was thinking about doing it for my recent one, but since it's an ad it would be an inside joke
Unfortunately, my editing skills are limited to Vegas.
yeah, you should check out the dubs for avatar.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYRxf13tIg <-- More Transformers music
do i need to repost the newletter link...?
lol i know
06,15I wish I could be, but I'll be out of intarwebs reach, mostly.
Heh
2,14 :(
Go ahead, I'm helpless with pictures anyway.
there has to be some sort of scenario
hmmm
Yeah. The representation would be either their nick taken literally or an OC pony.
like the first picture i made, the setting was a theater, because the movies are watched in the "theatre"
it could be a comic?
havent tried my hand at comics yet. well ther is one i made, but not really worht mentioning
i thought a poster too
*looks at val*
as he always makes them i think
heh, someone actually made a "master" pony with the delgado master.
Some would be easy, such as me. However, we'll end up with like six Rainbow Dashes.
yeah
with the goatee
I have a splendid Idea
I'd look weird with a goatee.
Go on, Celestia.
Ill make a DA thing with ideas for every REGULAR member. People can leave comments on there (or here, but i might not see it) of people for me to do
you mean like a request page?
Yeah
sort of like a "are you evil enough to grow a goatee"
I can totally pull off a goatee.
Did it.
owned.
I wish I could grow a mullet too.
Aw, it fell off
Mullets = awesome.
If only cancer fell off.

I'm still trying to figure out how to get this Avatar the Last Airbender anime that is mentioned.
did you check all the anime websites?
Yup
2,14 the last airbender anime is actually very good
I agree 100%
2,14 I can't say the same about the movie :P
Link please, Val.
blame it on the shamalyan
The movie is shit. The show is awesome.
Avatar was my favorite show

the face stealer ftw.
can we stream the rifftrax version plesae?
OSHI, it seems like HydraIRC DOES have functional colors!
06,15Haha, oh I wish...
its a good one, don't worry
and UHF is that.
i remember when P&SWG was the giggest topic on /a/a
/a/
What's the movies guys?
I don't get p&swg. whats the appeal?
Avatar movie... I was dissappoint.
besides all the fanservice whatever
I do like rrrrrules though
lol
RRRRURRRRRRU
http://anime-media.com/category/avatar-the-last-airbender-episodes/ <-- Cause that's not the anime, that's just a mislabeling of the nickelodeon series.
Because ponies.
i tried zooming in and out to adjust
Doesn't work either
someone forgot some xhtml coding~
basically yes
/me chats with a dedicated IRC client
now thats like a meception
memeception*
dpm
:(
Just a rifle.
You do realize that the chatbox under the stream is an IRC client, right?
oui
Totally an IRC client.
speaking of french. Would you guys ever stream wakfu?
Totally an IRC client
I'm with Espy on that
http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
That would have been pretty good actually espy
06,15BUCK YEAH!
Even if it ended with Zuko at a gravesite, it would have been an interesting way to end the series.
/me laughs
/me should subscribe but cba
Heya
Yea, but that's a different issue.
IF youre interested, that is.
plus they would do their racebending
no I was working.
Clearly if they were going to do the show justice they would have gotten a different director.
or just animate a movie...
its hard to imagine making bending look cool/realistic in live action
HD Avatar the Last Airbender animated feature?
I am disapoint I missed the supprise anouncment.
I still laugh every time I think about that night
no the real live movie
I believe
well you could just show the concentrated air or the effects of it blowing
I don't want to see that
I really with he does that again some other time
Oh yes, it can be done, and it could be done well.
I want to make him do caramelldansen.
XD
(10th time today)
Is there a stream?
harharharhar
Would also require teaching the various actors proper martial arts.
instead of the martial arts experts they had for the animated series
Home says we have Bladerunner for the 3rd week now :p
yeah dari needs to fix up that front page
that and they picked the right arts to fit each element
yeah the moive was terribad
All I see is a spinning circle with a blue bit in it.
oh and espy I think I can find something you'll like
the stream isn't up yet
I know :p
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrYjhf98pqQ&feature=related awesome song in one of the movies tomorrow. Luna don't watch it. You'll just cry

06,15Cant' promise it'll work, Denied_Existence, but here you go: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xchataqua/
Hey guys, in the actual show, is depressed Pinkie actually a different color, or is it just the lighting?
lighting i guess
Pony generator is a bit limited on hairstyles imo
I'd still say that Colloquy over X-chat port if you're a mac user
I found one for mac
It is xchat aqua, but slightly different
I drew mine. I reckon the wings a bit wrongly drawn though
Oh no clue if it's good i just know I saw a mac version.
pegasi ponies are best ponies
ill be back later guys
gotta go do somerthing
Denied_Existence, Colloquy. I know you won't be dissapointed
I never bothered with mac cause i cant build one my self or at least could not at the time i picked.
06,15Hmmm, okay. I do like X-Chat quite a lot, personally.

But SP is awesome...
i really dislike south park
LONLEY ISLAND
SOMEONE REQUEST IT
South Park's WoW parody's already become legendary.
ya there is
Besides, they'll most likely poke at the fandom rather than the show itself.
They might want to continue on that.
there is?
Where's my pony WoW parody
I'm watching them ASAP
2,14 none whatsoever
well on oct 5th we get more SP
Dari would give us an update
