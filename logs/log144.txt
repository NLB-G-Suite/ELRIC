OH GOD
And we've lost Dashie
a thing that's just for me
HOUSE IS FAMOUS IN CUBA
07,01of course he is!
I repeat we have lost dashie
it's kind of hard to explain without understanding my mentality
which is really messed up
ghosties is equal to or greater than a mod
basically, I need certain things to be kept sacred from the rest of my life
something that not even my friends know about
ah, I think I understand Jiggly
but I told some of them about the ponies
Jigglysaint: I know that feel, bro
there is one person where it's fine
she's cool with ponies
but she's also a trusted friend
there is another girl
We've all had that emo phase Jigglysaint
she's very disabled
04HAHAHAHA
I'm just recoverig from mine
04Oh man

Hey Nittany
Oh wow! Psychonauts is now available for Mac on Steam :3
/me is very sad right now
So many people coming and going :s
Darn.
LordCelestia: Lot of work?
Psychonauts = one of the best games ever made
CloudRunner: THIS.
mfw it's barely 9:45 and I'm tired as bloody hell
I dont have school tomorrow :P
ive been hurrying to show it to Luna and Robot, but now they left.
and i was almost done too
What did you do?
You ca show it to us
can*
Flaria needs 100CCs of pony STAT!
DAMN IT
Nah.
I have cursors to make.
Don't need distractions :3
Eff that, 1000 cc's will do the trick.
Flaria: You'll have Ponies AND YOU WILL LIKE IT
So who here has streaming privilages?
:O !
i dont have wireshark installed
Kencolt: You missed House.
Oh you and your wonderful cursors Flaria. :3
;-;
CloudRunner, aren't they grand? :33
we... seem... to be out of stream.
CloudRunner: ehh.... I'm not sure when I wanna notify everyone of them anymore.
/me sighs
ABANDON CANOE!
I'll tell ponies after I finish the mane 6, I guess.
Hello!
Baaawwwâ¦I like the Equestria Daily logo :D
Then I'll have templates for all the standard cursors and I can get them out more quickly.
o hai BonBon
i'm going to sleep
goodnight!

yo?
YEAH
What should I do for Link Select cursors?
Link Select is based on pony species, ie; pegasus, unicorn
Unicorn has glowy magic.
Guess I'm off too... nothing more to do, haven't got a slue...
What about the other races? :l
Pega needs flapping wings
Pegasus flies?
Earth pony trots?
Pegusus should just get unfurled wings
Pegasus wings sound good.
What about Earth Ponies?
Now that is hard...
one hoof raised up?
like some sort of pose
Good news. Grandmother is doing pretty well.
It has to involve the main cursor in some way, though.
Nittany_Tiger: Congrats!
I'm gonna head to bed as well everypony
Good night y'all
Nittany_Tiger: Good to hear!
Lagmobile they look like standard cursors but with pony colors and what not
Night AllisZero
Oh
Nittany, awesome!
Thanks everyone.
Nice Nittany
Oh NT that's great news!
/me hugs AllisZero goodnight
Sleep well, Allis!
Also see ya around AllisZero
You too! <3
Bye Zero
Night all
So are they similar to your twilight and luna ones Flaria?
later AllisZero
That Rainbow Dash comic *sniff* WHY DO PONIES HAVE TO DIE?!
waht RD comic?
Flaria Pega needs small flapping wings and earth sprouts a tail that flicks every now and then
must be memories
need... more... ponies... for... pitcure...
aww
CloudRunner: I'd add a tail, but... then they'd all need tails.
Is there some sort of wave of deprssion spreading in the brony community?
Oh wow, there's a MLP Online?!
And then I was sad. ;_;
No. Uni gets magic glow, Peg gets flapping wings, Earth gets tails
that ones old news SuperBrony
They just released a demo today though...
What about a simple horse shoe?
for the earth set
I... hrm.
Bad idea?
07,01Alright guys have a nice day / night
I'm trying to go for something that makes earth ponies special....
It doesnt work well with the setup
07,01See you all again tomorrow
/me hugs Luna goodnight for reals
07,01i'm leaving now
Night Luna!
Sleep well!
Good morning Luna
lol
Bye then
But they just specialize in things that those with magic or flight don't.
inafter Night Luna :(
Generally.
brb
Earth ponies will be hard to do...
yeah xD
Once I get ONE, I get them all, but dang, it is friggin hard
I'm sure you'll think of something..
Why do you have an Earth Pony's face tilted up so their nose points to the link
dont*
I still think a tail will be the best way to go.
CloudRunner: Tail is backup atm.
SuperBrony64 because the cursors look like normal cursors with pony colorscheem
So what's the difficulty then with the link click pointer? Flaria just needs to pick a color then?
there is a special animation that plays though
like with unicorn ponies there is a magic aura that appears when you hover over a link
SuperBrony64: Everypony has a custom colorset, for one
Two, they're supposed to be color scheme based
Oh okay.
Only Busy or Working in Background actually includes pony stuff.
I wish I had a gif of the link cursor to show him.
Well, Link Select is pony race based, but still.
TO EQD
You know that he auto posts EQD updates, right?
He's asleep right now.
now I do...
/me pats CloudRunner on the back
Wait! He lurks in his sleep!
o.o
first comic is awesome
Comic 2. Pinkie is bound and determined to get some of that chocolate rain. :p
/me checks back for "kick me" sign.
/me found a sign that says "Error 404, kick me not found"

Hi Fluttershy`!
Flaria, mine was a dslite and was dark sparkly blue on top and flat black on the bottom and i had a skullcandy sticker on the top
Oh good, now that you're here, fluttershy`, take a ganer.... at THIS!
ctrlx: Cobalt! I had the same one! Minus the sticker...
also broke the powerbutton so i had to rig it up P: i used my car key most of the time to turn it on/off
Mine was a birthday present, too....
i can't for the life of me figure out where it could have went to.
SuperBrony64: John Joseco?
oh wait yeah
That's the artist yeah
oh my
i need a fork
08,1hey...
Forks are for humans.
:p
Did anypony come up with an idea, or did nopony say anything?
Fluttershy` = best pony
I can't think of anything at the moment Flaria, soery..
And that ladys and gentelmen is how you brown nose
Fluttershy is indeed the best pony :P
Flaria what are you talking about?
idea for who?
Earth Pony Link Select.
orite
Unicorn has complicated transparency magic wavy thingy
right now i can only think chimmy changa and how messy it is to eat
I am having one hell of a time with thinking of one...
WHO WATS MORE SOUL CRUSHING?
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/436613.html#436613
Pegasi are going to have wings (How I'm going to do that is going to be a moment of miracle)
I do I do!
Flaria, maybe just one wing?
and if you want to feel better: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/469387.html#469387
ctrlx: It's more that I'm just not a good artist and this stuff is coming out awesome because I have time and dedication and it's pixels
The tread starter...
screw it heres a link to everything http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/465129.html
Flaria, you do good work on them though ;D
I have the time, dedication, stubbornness and equipment
Y'know, 1000 monkeys in a room, they accidentally shakespeare
Flaria Have the wings tilted at the same angle as the cursor
Well yeah.
I'm definitely one for symmetry.
Shrubbery.
Nuff said.
To make it easy, make them standing up and then turn them (what looks to me like) 45 degrees to fit with the cursor
CloudRunner: Wait, what?
god damn this really is depressing... http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131632724574.png
I'm adding wings TO the cursor.
animating on a 45 deg angle has too be a bitch
Back.
Lagmobile: Yeah, that sure is one sad sadfic
Welcome back SploogeTheFish
Thanks
CloudRunner: I will stop at /NOTHING/ TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS FANDOM
I had the shittiest day at school today.
Except custom pony cursors with custom animation based off of everypony's character would take years and artistic talent.
On my schedule, anyway.
SploogeTheFish: Why was your day bad?
:(
:(
Flaria yea, but animate the wings separate from the cursor (so it is easy to animate) and then mold them with the cursor later
And i went back to school after that day
And i feel like im like..Disabled
Why am I reading the B'awwwww thread?
I cant cary shit
FreezeFrame: Link?
Cause its my right arm
My right arm=Strong arm
FreezeFrame because a good cry never hurts
CloudRunner: I build the first cursor with wings until it's to my satisfaction, then I destroy the base and color-code whats left
SploogeTheFish: Oh no! That's terrible! D:
My belt was hanging out
If I lost my right arm....
I... oh lord.
My shirt tail was dangling
My pants were hanging
Flaria is a techno wizard
CloudRunner: True. But I'm already completely gone after just a few.
I looked like a mess
if i lost my right arm i'd still be using it anyways because i'm mean to myself :x
Though the Spike short story did the most.
I will have to read that when I have more time...
I still remember my first time reading the cupcakes document
SploogeTheFish, you'll get the hang of it. :3 you're just not used to your other arm
o.e
Why would you ever do that SploogeTheFish?
wait what happened to your arm splooge?
I dont know why.
i refuse to read fanfics
A friend of mine sent me there.
busy tryig not to cry here sorry
I read the first piece
/me hugs Lagmobile
I just left it
Lagmobile, i know that feel bro
Like I said
i was like.."This shit is fucked up"
/me joins the hug with Flaria and Lagmobile
I've become a faucet since becoming a brony
Tears, everywhere.
god damn sad fics...
Happy and sad and insane.
I still think im an early brony.
I became one in august
ctrlx That is what I was doing (to avoid head canon) but then a youtube vid got me to read Bubbles.
Only to be a closet brony for that whole duriation
Oh lord, Bubbles.
CloudRunner, idk what bubbles is.
I was soul crushed for days
right, you were saying splooge? your friend set you to the ifirmary?
ctrlx: When you wanna sad, read it
My summary of Cupcakes: Epically written story, but based on a very controversial topic.
It's a sadfic about Derpy as a filly
one sec ctrlx I will get a link
Flaria, all i need is the pic :x
SuperBrony64: This.
ctrlx: It's a text doc, not a pic
Bubbles?
Flaria, the bubbles one or the link that Lagmobile showed?
ctrlx: Bubbles is a sadfic about filly Derpy, and it involves some very depressing stuff.
I was sent to the infirmary because some kid gave me an "Armshock" by putting his knuckle in my elbow
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgkrBTryVCfmAARA5ZCMTY4nTa2ta2-mhmdpxvipEoA/edit?hl=en&pli=1#
wow
that kids a douche
I had the shittiest day. Period.
He is too.
He is a dick to everybody
i'm sure some of hte fics are amazingly well written but i just don't like playing with the characters that much outside of the show.
CloudRunner: has the Bubbles link.
SploogeTheFish, shoot him with the friendship cannon
I will try that
also, do you have a cast?
SploogeTheFish: What a jerk.
i did give everyone that link to all the sad fics rigt? http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/436613.html#436613
SploogeTheFish: Let me hug him.
I know.
Follow "Bubbles" up with "Today, Tomorrow, and Forever" and you will not want to live anymore.
And when i got that armshock
I crack backs with my hugs, sometimes more. Never permanent damage, but... he'll be aching from my love.
I felt it in my wrist
and the sad fic feel better ... http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/469387.html#469387
yea Lagmobile you did
REad the alternate endings to recover
It felt like i was being shocked in the wrist
/me is scared of FLaria now.
Bubbles' alternate ending is, in my opinion, better than its original.
I reposted anyway
SploogeTheFish, do you have a cast? if so, what color did you pick?
RAINBOWS!
My cast,I chose dark blue.
damn
It's still sad, too
there is no dark blue pony :(
ThePretender: I'm actually pretty scary sounding, but you know how I am. :l
I wish they had rainbows D:
I never really liked fanfiction in general
Theres always trixie
Flaria, how scary sounding?
SploogeTheFish, that's true
then my friends gt me writing and now im a little more tolerant
But im not really a fan of Trixie
I love Trixie!
She so hammy
I mean, She only appeared in one appisode
*episode*
So dis djpon3
so did vinyl scratch and her appearance was only for like
and octavia
Most ponies assume I do martial arts, I'm quick and flexible and, once, I was told I looked like I was in the mob. :l
5 seconds?
Eeyup.
and screwball
Flaria, are you?
DJ-PON-3 was only shown for like a straight 7 seconds, And she was never featured in an episode ever again.
5 seconds
but is obviously the best pony
and then teres a that animation glicth where blues turneed ito a cyclops for exactly 7 frames...
ctrlx: No! :(
>mfw Flaria might be mob material
brb
I have that look, though, of professional crime, I suppose.
Flaria, pony mob? ;D
Flash mob?
Pony mobs for MC?
I wouldnt want to hurt one.
D:
Pony mob I'd join in a heartbeat.
guys!
let's form our own secret society!
the pony mob!
DO IT FILLY
sounds good to me
/me calls dibs on boss
That kid who gave me the armshock, Im not gonna fight him
we can go around
and make FRIENDS
lol
I'll burn him to the ground with my friendship!
ctrlx "make" friends
He's going to love me.....
I can fight and everything, I just hate hurting other people, Whether its emotional or physically.
Don't worry Splooge
*cracks knuckles**
/me calls dibs on head boss
the pony mob will take care of him
he'll be sleeping with the seaponies
with love!
/me calls on Second in Command
I hate being a dick to other people. Im just born with it.
Splooge you and I bro.
I am a professional dick
Oh god, that suicidal fluttershy pic
I generaly dislike being mean, but when I have to be
It takes me alot to get pissed off
I like being an asshole XD
WHAT is going on here.
Warning: really, really depressing. http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131637992725.jpg
Clicking for the hell of it.
DO I need to settle a conflict? With my moon canno!?
*cannon
I'm a short fuse, so to say. :l
look at ALL the depressing pics
Im a fuse..Thats like 1.5 miles long.
FreezeFrame I...
I...
Ow...
Most of the time, I'll banish sadness to the moon.
No,
My soul hurts...
leave that to me!
Yeah
:D
My fuse? 10 feet. But I hold it in, so yeah. :|
I did warn
YES
I WOULD
Pretty much:)
Oh no! That Bubbles story...
/me counters with Soul Crusher!
*cries*
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgkrBTryVCfmAARA5ZCMTY4nTa2ta2-mhmdpxvipEoA/edit?hl=en&pli=1#
Permission to make an inappropiate joke about fuses, everyone?
Honestly, Ive never had a girl talk to me yet. But i dont really care. Its gonna come up sooner or later.
go for it
I dunno if I wanna crush my soul. :/
ooh, newsletter
My fuse is 8 inches long, and when it's set to blow, it's spectacular.
Newsletter!
/me hugs SuperBrony64
I've seen Avatar Airbender movies
movie*
sry for the name spam.
Well. Looks like the bubbles doc is just another violent MLP fanfic. :l
if it were on my computer, I'd THROW IT ON THE GROUND
Flutterguy Just remembering "Today, Tomorrow, and Forever" Sends me into an abyse of sadness... :(
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME?
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
Lol @ Flutterz
Flutterz: This
I MIGHT ACTUALLY CRY
ThePretender what?
Splooge: Bubbles isn't overtly violent
not at all
The last movie for Sunday
is WHat Dreams May Come
but it will make you cry
Speaking of depressing
do it
I've seen parts of it, ans it's soooo moving
Lag spike :/(
Bubbles is just... cruel.
Can anybody like..Summarize the bubbles doc? Im sorta tired and i dont want to read it all.
Back
I'll PM ya
I felt so bad for Bright Eyes
what i miss?
Welcome back, Lagmobile
it's really short, Splooge
Nobody summarize
Good lord why are there so many sad fics?
it would literaly ruin it
Causd people are depressed..?
indeed, CloudRunner
and whey do i keep reading it all?
Damnit.
Lagmobile because crying clenses the soul
I guess so...
Summary: Baaaaaaawwww Derpy :(
I always feel better after a good cry
Imma try to fill this bucket...
and Celestia knows there are a ton of bronies who desparately need their souls cleansed
Sadly I cant cry over real people.
YES I DO
thanks for mentioning.
You want a sad derpy one? I got a sad dinky comic http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131633592530.jpg

08,1M-Morning, everypony... -yawns-
Morning Fluttershy
08,1Mmm...
No sleep?
08,1No, no, I just seem to be an early riser. I woke up at 6 this morning... which was 2 and a half hours ago
Hey Fluttershy`.
08,1Dari! -glomps-
Hmmnh I see
I hate waking up well before I wanted to.
I had to wake up at 6
So that is like 4 hours earlier than I wanted to
08,1I'm sorry Revolver :<
Meh
It was ok
I had a red bull
I woke up at 3 in the morning breathing fire
08,1o-o; you did?
I went to bed at 3 in the morning
No antacid around I stuffed my mouth full of ground coffee
I didn't know I wasn't supposed to swallow it, but oh well everything is experience
Ohai Fluttershy`
I've gotten less than 24 hours of sleep this week total
08,1sigh. too much red bull for you methinks
Nag
*nah
Just an insomniac
/me 8huggles him tightly. "You need moar sleep!"
I know the feeling brah
Nothing I can really do about it
Went to bed at 10, can hardly stay up on my feet waking up at 8
08,1...that's 10 hours of sleep
I actually feel perfectly fine right now
"Im not a channel operator"
Yeah, 10 hours of sleep that feel like four
08,1why?
/me 8pokes Hat
Not sure. Probably restlessness or a bad bed or something like that
I'm trying to kick myself
08,1ooh, a kick in the mornin' always feels good
Not when it's in the balls
Then it sucks
Oh Fluttershy u so
yellow
I can relate
08,1why yes I am yellow
08,1XD
I actually got kicked in the balls this morning
Lucky Im not a bucket hat today
Been over 10 years since I got last kicked in the nuts. No female friends really helps staying clear of those
Scratch that
No friends really helps staying clear of those*
I got kicked by a female friend
My guy friends dont hit below the belt at all
08,1I have no balls :3
Yes
You must not be from the UK then Revolver.
We figured that out
I a
You have wings though
*I am not
that's a fate that guys don't wish on even their enemies.. girls simply don't understand
Not at all
Friends over here beat the shit out of other, because theat's what real friendship is about. :>
each other*
that's*
What is wrong with my spelling today...
Friendship sounds violent
08,1I'm not sure
08,1I'm so glad I'm a female in real life. I have chesticles instead of testicles!
We do that here too
Just don't hit below the bElt
Lawl.
08,1XD
Well, you're lucky then.
But
We do chokeslams and such
08,1Why yes I am. I like my breasted body >3>
Yeah, so do us guys
And I probably like it too
Lawl at the immediate male reaction ^
08,1Hahaha ;P
I'm suprised you didn't say anything Dari
So much for fluttershy's timidity
in a room full of guys.. that topic should probably not be brought up.. in a room full of girls that topic should DEFINITELY not be brought up
I don't make comments like that about my fellow moderators.
Outside of mod chat anyway...
>_>
08,1SHOWERS
08,1and watermelon!
XD
08,1So many crazy things happen in modchat... e-e
and that was only partly a joke.. seriously..
My comment wasn't
08,1Speaking of watermelon, I had the most amazing watermelon Italian soda yesterday~ It's my favorite
Hmmm
Watermelon soda
FUND IT
I don't quite like watermelon anything, besides watermelon itself
It's funny because I generally don't like fruit, and when I do I prefer processed stuff
AllisZero: GTFO, right now
Fruit is the shit.
Apples in particular
No, watermelon in particular.
Watermelon is fruit-God incarnate.
I don't eat fruit or vegetables, Dari
Y U SO UNHEALTHY?
08,1mfw I started another watermelon debate (at least Vi isn't here with her opposing pineapple argument right now lol )
lolwat
Maybe why I feel like I'm 70 sometimes
Anyone like angel bunny?
Watermelon is the only fruit I eat
I love Angel. XD
He's so funny.
08,1I love Angel o-o
08,1<3
watermelon is a fruit? i thought it was obese
Angel is awesome
You thought it was what...? O_o
Okay so that's one slashfic on the bin...
08,1Obese, apparently
just something to see what comments i would get tbh:P
it's not unusual to be loved by watermelon
08,1watermelon = diabeetus?
Yeah he's on crack
enjoy having that song stuck in your head lol
Soooo. What's being streamed tonight?
I can't stream tonight
EspyLacopa: Stoofz

08,1well it's... mod movie night...

Still a bit crazy Fluttershy`?
http://www.youtube.com/user/stoofz <-- Stoofz?
Sometime we should see Moon and Miracle Dogs Too
08,1lol
08,1I'm better today
Good.. Good....
08,1I kinda went off my rocker yesterday, I know. Stupid female hormones.
08,1All men in here! Be glad you are not a girl!
It's ok
just a minute ago girls were lucky
We all just really want to be ponies
08,1Lol. Girls are lucky
08,1but we just have a monthly punishment for being gifted with our bodies
rainbow week sounds awesome.. too bad it's probably not pony related
08,1colorful emotions

08,1eh, closer to four to five days
i know less than i thought i did
It makes stiff
*stuff
08,1yes, yes you do

Looking at what FIM is achieving, what Avatar was
08,1I know what it is at least >>
07,01goodie
Sometimes I feel bad I chose the career I did
Wow that's an amazing weakness to be vulnerable to a colour
07,01Anyone else noticed our newsletter with the line up for this weekend?
Golden Age Green Lanterns was weak agains wood

immune to bullets, but that Baseballbat was dangerous
Hence the scout
Golden Age GLs must be wary of the Ents.
He had also a ridicolous costume
Hmm. Would an Entish Green Lantern still be weak to Wood?
http://www.comicartcommunity.com/gallery/details.php?image_id=33072
EspyLacopa: I know, but still. I never thought I'd be stuck with a blue collar job like everyone else out there, as opposed to going into the creative field
Buuut I guess we do whatchwe gotta do
there is now a living planet that is a green lantern

Before the week is over, i believe we will see a Avatar Pony picture
if you could be one pony from the show for a day, which would you want to be?
07,01from FIM?
yes
07,01Luna
I love Fluttershy but I'd probably be Twilight
What are this week's movies?
07,01http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
I would choose Doctor Whooves
Big Mac
07,01if you want to receive the newsletter let me know
I'M A GROWN MAN WHY AM I FANTASIZING ABOUT BEING A PONY
A whole bunch of movies.
AllisZero: Because Equestria would be an awesome place to live.

also an alternative to Whooves, I would want to be Blueblood
Celestia knows, I could be a nicer guy than him
wait I AM a nicer guy than him
on that T-shirt is no Rarity, therefore it's not FABULOUS!
If I were to get a pony shirt, it'd probably be this one: http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=737

Oooo, Kamen Rider the First in glorious DCD Quality?

She's got a name, thus is ineligible

1st or 2nd encounter HD
07,01okidokie
07,01second it is
Hey
hey
just rediscovered it
Why is Pinkie an Archer?
Pinkie warps Reality all the time
so what better role for her
...Caster?
the artist likes Pinie
Pinkie
he also made the Silent Ponyville series
That the series with the guy wearing a pyramid hat?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-silent-ponyville.html Read it if you want
It has my endorsement
FLUTTERSHY IS SO CUTE IN THAT COMIC!
Fluttershy is always cute.
She has the magicks.
hey, I've got a square screen and I used to be able to see both the IRC and stream by scrolling out...but it won't anymore
does anyone know what movies are on tonight?
also a good question
...Idunno :(
I didn't even know they /made/ square screens.
Its to quiet..
i know, i thought something was wrong with my internet
Thats why I said something. It usually only gets this quiet when I lose connection
same, hey is the chat on bronystate below the video on your computer?
No, it will go beside it if your resolution is high enough
strange, its that it was fine yesterday but now its below
oh well, when it comes to the stream, i will just have mIRC open instead
Hm
greetings, I have RETURNED
I'm back
yay~
Erm
One of my questions in my schoolwork today
Its a fill in the blank question
But anyway. PONIES
Appleloosa train much?
07,01that was fun Dumori!
Hey Luna
07,01hey revolver
Indeed it was Luna
i hope that luna episode post is true
Oh man that EQD post seems EPIC
i'm just going to assume the most awesome idea for an episode is the one that's true
Luna and Celestia sing a duet?
the ponies get trapped in dwarf fortress
oh god
MeteorVenture but would RD find winning fun
I mean lossing
:\
she wouldn't lose with her cloud construction skills
she wouldn't win either.. but she wouldn't lose
yeah but Dwarf Fortress' tag line is lossing is fun
i think the misspelled "fine"
"i'm this plan can't possibly fail.. losing is fine too"
x3
07,01>mfw reading EQD
07,01Oh yes yes yes yes !
mfw Luna gets her own episode
07,01rumor...
close enough for me
Luna in a Halloween episode?
not going to get my hopes up until the tv listing is posted
Well, it does kinda match up, so I'm trusting this one for now.
then i will go full on luna fan mode
....Isn't ep3 supposed to air on something like Oct22?
07,01well ep 3 is confirmed
So ep4 is Oct29. . .
that's a true rumor
07,01oct 15 >.<
I thought that E3 was on the 15th
NOOOOOOOO
in other words it's DEFINITELY a rumor
Ah.
Tonight is the Wicker Man, right?
nah idk i'm just making puns
but i bet it will be awesome, mostly because ithink its because the Bronies really wanted a luna episode
/me wants a Luna episode!
Anonymous: No, tonight is UHF
UHF?
07,01this weekends line up, also if you want the newsletter in your mailbox PM me

07,01What Dash said
Maybe later, I usually just look to the front page for these types of things, but that hasn't been updated lately.
ooh i have wanted to see that supposedly terrible avatar movie
UHF be a Weird Al Yankovic movie.
Ohai guys
Ohai

Kamen Rider and UHF
07,01Badumtish
Hi everyone
Ohai
hello
07,01Who wants the BronyState Newsletter? Please PM me!
Huh. D&D Online is adding the Artificer class.
I might try D&D one day.
Not today though ^_^
Oh, Luna, would you like to see the thing I made?
07,01sure
I wouldv'e added more ponies to this, but it could'
ve easily messed it up
07,01lol
07,01did you see our newsletter LordCelestia?
The rarity one?
07,01yea
07,01and the art contest
I don't think I read the entire thing, ill be sure to
Did you like the picture?
07,01I like it yes
I thought it was pretty good but why aren't they sitting together?
Thanks, and I couldnt use too many ponies
I didn't think there was such a thing as too many ponies :P
So I threw in the mane 6, princesses, pinkies, octavia, and a few others
and discord. even bad people enjoy a good movie now and then.
I'm just wondering why the mane 6 aren't bunched together that's all.
x3
love that pinkie is in 3 places, was the 1st thing i saw
^what dash said
anyone notice that the TF2 cupcakes song parody made it to the most viewed on youtube?
Seriously?
Film and animation section*
even so that's based on most views.
damn right it should
I reckon 20% of youtube is now pony related.
Nice. ^^
soon the whole internet will be 20% pony
then the world, and then the universe! (somehow)
Right now it's 99% ads, 1% other.
Hey, I started my own movie night early (Phineas and Ferb: across the 2nd Dimension). WHO'S READY FOR THE WEEKEND?!
Sandvich?
SANDVICHES!
So moist and delicious^
SANDVICH!
I'M COMING FOR YOU
SANDVICH!
This... did not just happen!
:3
Heavy. How. Do. I. Make. Sandvich?
.........................................
X'D
the guy who made that deserves +9001 internets.
Scout's reaction at the end makes it 20% cooler.
im just going to watch modception and then some engineer trip
Modception?
The stream is on? :D
What's the Scouter say about his Internet Count?
It's 1006.

Oh, I can't enter that contest. I don't have THAT much artwork. Plus, I can't stream.
07,01well you can work on it ;)
I wipe my system of pony once weekly :S
if i could draw then i would enter pictures
Therefore all art ends up deleted.
any one got a link to the line up
I just have all my pony files on backup. just in case, y'know, somethin happens.
you guys shoudl really post the news letter on tyhe home page
that too
oH oh oh
Bronystate is sponsoring a contest?
2,14 yes we are!
Doctor doctor, give me the news
I need ze infos
2,14 to any and all Brony artists who may be interested
2,14 the contest officially begins October 1st
2,14 so the rules and whatnot will be posted then
I might just enter that.
2,14 any and all are welcome :P
If only my scanner didn't break :/
>MFW I thought it was already october.
2,14 use GIMP :P
2,14 nope, still September :P
i better start learning to draw ponies then, i got a random idea the other day
I have a few ideas
I get ideas for comics, draw them out, then realize the storyline sucks :/
Hey guise what's going on here?
2,14 well, trial and error is the only way we progress ;)
I get ideas for comics
Combustiblelemons: Work on them regardless, because it's better than having a great story and never doing anything to put it into motion.
draw them and go shit my drawing is SHIT!
06,15'sup bronies
Hey Pinkie.
A honest suggestion from someone who does just that.
Hi robotpinkie
Hi RP
'sup RobotPinkie
ohai robotpinkie ^_^
hey RP
;__;
Sorry there whatpayne, we're discussing the artist competition
06,15Gots me a haircut and a fashion style AJ, now. Oh yeah... some days are good.
Haha nice
lol awesome
whut, you have long hair?
06,15Time to put my Tifa figure on a poneh
Why thank you Combustiblelemons. That's nice. What particular competition?
06,15I HAD long hair, not anymore :P
I'm not sure, ask val or luna about it
what colour pinkie?
*what colour is your hair
WhatPayne: the competition mentioned in the newsletter
2,14 basically, it's going to be an art competition officially starting tomorrow
2,14 all the info will be posted on our DA page tomorrow
06,15My hair is dark brown, I guess.
Ah. Well isn't that nice. I will check that out.
hi guys
http://tinyurl.com/BronyStateNewsletter
hi zephird
there the link WhatPayne
where are rarity's eyes D:
gah! They got me all pumped for pony with the first two episodes and now they take it away so soon! I need my new ponies damn it!
2,14 that's how all of my newsletters have been done :P
I suppose it makes sense now I think about it
2,14 the eyes/extreneous details are taken out so it doesn't draw too much attention from the words
don't worry fengor, 15 days without pony is tolerable
I hope episode 3 doesn't get delayed though
we done 4 months without pony, we can easily conquer 15 days
^my thoughts exactly
gah my chat is below the stream
and zoo,ing doesnt fix it
zooming*
zoo,ing is something completely different
same
anyone know how to fix this?
stream is up?
not for me
err got disc
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh, did you guys see the episode 4 rumour?
2,14 I'm not sure...are you using firefox?
same here InsertCupcake, when stream is up, im just going to have mIRC open
yes
we did
im using firefox
I'm about to cry
2,14 is any sidebar open? like bookmarks or history?
yes Zephirdd_ buts it is just a rumor
nope
DWR: DON'T SAY THAT.
i'm using chrome.
it must not be.
so wait until proof is posted then go full on luna fan
Chrome, Y U FAIL ME NOW D:
2,14 I dunno, sorry everypone :(
>is blaming chrome, not val ^_^
so glad i figured out mirc just incase this would happen :d
I know what will fix this! annoying shrunk windows!

who?
RobotPinkie
WUT
2,14 she can ride chocobos
what.
what is streaming that Tifa came up in conversation?
06,15Is anything streaming?
2,14 no stream yet :P
who the fuck is Tifa?
I ain't seen Nothin' yet
Aeris Gainsborough > Tifa Lockheart
Tifa out of nowhere.
Revolver, Final Fantasy 7
No Final Fantasy 7 fanwars
so that explains why I don't know who they are
i dont even play Final fantasy yet i knew who that was
(has never played FF)
06,15My Tifa Lockheart Advent Children figure can't fit on a pony, due to her skirt-like thing. What's there to misunderstand? :P
Princess Garnet Til Alexandros The 17th > others
whats with the bronystate site
there now that makes sense.
06,15Cloud Strife fits perfectly on my fashion style Rarity, so...
the chat's below the stream window now
RobotPinkie
LAWL
Tifa and Aerith/Aeris were good friends. I don't get the hate for them
yeah some technical problems.
dari will fix it soon ^_^
06,15PERFECTLY: http://i.imgur.com/5e3w3.jpg
Tifa and Aeris knew each other for like a month
then aerith
yknow
kicked the bucket
(shh spoilers)
lmfao pinkie
not everyone beat the first disc
06,15You know you love it, Combustiblelemons :P
mfw I'm hidden in Fallout while I'm shooting an enemy with an Anti Material Rifle
Tifa cried for her. Also Twilight knew the other 5 only for a day, yet they were the best of friends
but they're the elements
makes me almost tempted to buy my own ponies to see what action figures I can get on them.
humans take longer to become friends
plus, Tifa and Aeris were competing for Cloud's heart
especially if there's a whiny guy in bwtn
These are humans in VIDEO GAMES! Also they were good sports about the cloud thing
mfw I just found out how awesome it is to snipe in Fallout New Vegas
Stop taunting me with games I have never played but know are awesome!
D:
in the advent children parts
tifa looks alot lot better
then go get Fallout New Vegas and the expansions if you think that it's awesome
06,15I really like AJ's hat, except that it's pink...
they went the same direction with lara croft
I really want to slap the designers of hasbro toys.
they don't have the poofiness
but real life string can't do that
Even a kid could notice they're off colour. Colours are the first things you learn.
Hmmmm. The idea of Poison Joke turning Celestia pink. . .
wai not
Celestia hates pink?
says whom?
says espy.
I did?
espy is invalid
It's a throwaway joke due to the Celestia toys.
More likely it'd turn everything she says into sounding like she was an evil tyrant. (the joke being on us)
also hello everypony
anyone see that dashie wonderbolt on EQD?
the toys were made before the final version of the characters were ok'd
06,15I dunno, Celestia should be SLIGHTLY pink... too bad they made her like Pinkie Pie pink...
sold for $600.
Hey master
When does this 'special' night start up anyway?
^Soon.
whats so special about it? >.>
2,14 it's our six month anniversary silly filly
:D oh yeah!
Confess that you secretly obtained the entire 2nd season leaked and you're going to show it!
I think I've been here since the first one actually
2,14 <.< >.>
*hipster cred*
2,14 YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF
06,158PM EST, says the newsletter
06,15No idea what that means
/me 2,14 hordes all the S2 episodes
/me walks up to TheMaster "Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave before you find out too much."
2,14 that means it starts at 8PM EST you silly :P
BAD ValtheJean
06,15Ohhhhh, see THAT makes sense :P
Pinkie says you gotta share D:
No! you'll never silence The Master
just listen to these drums
so it would be around 1am maybe for us robot?
If you find out too much, then I'm gonna have to send you away. And you know where that'll be. :D
or earlier

I've seen you send plenty of perfectly powerless ponies to the moon already though.
also how did your drawing go lordcelestia?
I finished it, it came out better than i originally planned, i guess.
you monsters are going to show 'that' movie on saturday?
06,15Man, I really like how the Hasbro toys look, apart from their crazy accessories and colors that are wrong.
even i'm not that evil.

if you feel like taking a look
man im on fire today with these links!
Dash is our derpybot of bronystate.
Man, I wish I still had windows movie maker and youtube downloader. I know the most AWESOME song to play in the background when discord is defeated, a track from the transformers 3 OST. It would make it like 20 million percent cooler

thats a great choice for the B movie.
The 'a' movie for saturday though...not sure if I'm that much of a masochist.
i agree
Combustiblelemons it's even better. watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nff3Bj09glk&list=FL4XR30kDJY1eUdxH7O1ZCCQ&index=1#t=01m16s
its even worse because I loved avatar the cartoon
We need a picture for Bronystate which has all the regulars represented in some way.
^ I can do that :D
that would be awesome Trollestia
Sunday is a good choice. I love Hamlet with lions
I was thinking about doing it for my recent one, but since it's an ad it would be an inside joke
reminds me of the inception trailer music lordcelestia
Unfortunately, my editing skills are limited to Vegas.
What is this ridiculous "anime" that was mentioned talking about? Since when did the japanese make a cartoon about the airbending avatar?
06,15>yfw I didn't even know what movies are supposed to air on Saturday and Sunday
yeah, you should check out the dubs for avatar.
2,14 clearly you need to read the skype chat more pinkie :P
06,15Kamen Rider and UHF though? Oh hell yeah....

do i need to repost the newletter link...?
06,15I can't be here those days, is more the problem, Val :(
What? Skype?
I may help out with that poster trollestia
I'm still looking for avatar the last airbender in the original japanese.
But I was definately considering putting the regulars into my art
TheMaster: There is no original japanese.
lol i know
06,15I wish I could be, but I'll be out of intarwebs reach, mostly.
Heh
2,14 :(
Trollestia, you wouldn't be upset if I did it, would you? This idea's been floating around in my head for a while. I almost put a Robot pinkie in my picture but i couldnt find one.
what would the masters cutie mark be...drums?
Go ahead, I'm helpless with pictures anyway.
LordCelestia: how about if they have an OC, you could put that in and their name from chat above (just shooting random ideas here)
there has to be some sort of scenario
hmmm
I'd just be a burning lemon I guess >.>
Yeah. The representation would be either their nick taken literally or an OC pony.
it could be a comic?
e.g. a state named Brony
I was thinking just a big poster.
havent tried my hand at comics yet. well ther is one i made, but not really worht mentioning
^read my mind trollestia
Who made this weeks flyer?
i thought a poster too
you mean the newsletter EspyLacopa ?
*looks at val*
i think it was ValtheJean
...And yet you still know what I'm talking about.
as he always makes them i think
heh, someone actually made a "master" pony with the delgado master.
Some would be easy, such as me. However, we'll end up with like six Rainbow Dashes.
the master as in from doctor who the master?
yeah
thought so.
with the goatee
I have a splendid Idea
I'd look weird with a goatee.
Go on, Celestia.
go on LordCelestia
so would I. would be nice to grow one just to brag
Ill make a DA thing with ideas for every REGULAR member. People can leave comments on there (or here, but i might not see it) of people for me to do
you mean like a request page?
That sounds good, I'll make a dA account.
Yeah
sort of like a "are you evil enough to grow a goatee"
I can totally pull off a goatee.
Did it.
owned.
I wish I could grow a mullet too.
Aw, it fell off
Mullets = awesome.
Like cancer ;___;
If only cancer fell off.
So wait, I thought I saw something about this weeks BMN. What are we showing?
http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
its a weekend marathon of movies evidently
thats the newletter

Unlimited Movie Works?
07,01not only that...
and other stuff
07,01on the Sunday schedule during the post show i'll stream Episode 1 & 2 of Season 2
KING OF STREAMERS, DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH FILMS?
I'm still trying to figure out how to get this Avatar the Last Airbender anime that is mentioned.
Ah.... now I'm saddened.
did you check all the anime websites?
Yup
you may have to rely on the dubs. even though they're obviously not as good
olol
Nah, that can't be what the newsletter was talking about, that's a nickelodeon original series.
Hopefully you can find a site which has them all on espy :S
stupid baka gaijin, what do they know about animation.
2,14 the last airbender anime is actually very good
I agree 100%
2,14 I can't say the same about the movie :P
Link please, Val.
blame it on the shamalyan
The movie is shit. The show is awesome.
I chased up the last airbender on the internet
Avatar was my favorite show
Ohai all
same
06,15I thought the Rifftrax version was pretty funny, ValtheJean :P
>isn't on bronystate.net
hey Dermathil !
I wish it was still going but it had to end.
but im still saddened -_-
2,14 lol
i remember when it was the biggest topic on /co/
^lol
the face stealer ftw.
can we stream the rifftrax version plesae?
OSHI, it seems like HydraIRC DOES have functional colors!
What is this UHF thing for movie two?
06,15Haha, oh I wish...
its a good one, don't worry
King Bumi and his secret club full of old people.
I loved the part with the fall of ba sing se
basically. weird al made a movie
and UHF is that.
i remember when P&SWG was the giggest topic on /a/a
FFF
/a/
What's the movies guys?
I don't get p&swg. whats the appeal?
Avatar movie... I was dissappoint.
besides all the fanservice whatever
P&SwG is about shock appeal.
2,14 I think my favorite part was when it took 7 guys doing a very exotic dance to lift a tiny little rock going at 5 mph
I do like rrrrrules though
WHAT THE HAY
lol
RRRRURRRRRRU
why is the chat and stream no longer side-to-side?
^^
question question,useless question..is something streming now?10m i'm watching the loading animation XD
http://anime-media.com/category/avatar-the-last-airbender-episodes/ <-- Cause that's not the anime, that's just a mislabeling of the nickelodeon series.
Because ponies.
i tried zooming in and out to adjust
Doesn't work either
someone forgot some xhtml coding~
so we have to open 2 windows to chat and watch similtaneously.
when stream starts, just have a window with chat in it or mIRC
didn't any of you take computer science three? srsly, you're dealing with a master here.
basically yes
/me chats with a dedicated IRC client
now thats like a meception
memeception*
This is gonna be so awesome. Unfortunately, I've got to go out of state to pick up a gun.
IRC is going to be my chat backup
dpm
:(
what type of gun Trollestia ?
woops. don't do it trollestia!
Just a rifle.
You do realize that the chatbox under the stream is an IRC client, right?
oui
Totally an IRC client.
speaking of french. Would you guys ever stream wakfu?
lucky that I managed to modify my hydraIRC client to allow it to connect here
Totally an IRC client
I havent ever had any problems With Chatzilla if anyone wonders about it
Chatzilla <3
I wish the Avatar movie had been about Zuko finding his mother, post-series.
wait, what are the movies this week?
I'm with Espy on that
http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
That would have been pretty good actually espy
There ya go, Dermathil.
KAMEN RIDER!!!!!!!!!!!!
07,01>mfw Dermathil is not part of our newsletter :o
06,15BUCK YEAH!
That's SO NewDCD's idea
Even if it ended with Zuko at a gravesite, it would have been an interesting way to end the series.
>mfw I never thought of taking the newsletter since I rarely check mails and trying to get derpymail before
hey Sumica
/me laughs
Hi sumica
Heya
yeah but regardless of what the movie was about. Mnight would be directing it
Tonight is apparently Kamen Rider the First and then UHF.
Sumica, were you here last night to see my picture?
Yea, but that's a different issue.
IF youre interested, that is.
plus they would do their racebending
no I was working.
Clearly if they were going to do the show justice they would have gotten a different director.
06,15Kamen Rider is awesome... It's one of the reason I stuck around here at first, because NewDCD was streaming KR Black...
or just animate a movie...
Ah, i see.
its hard to imagine making bending look cool/realistic in live action
HD Avatar the Last Airbender animated feature?
I am disapoint I missed the supprise anouncment.
DCD had me forever when he sung numa numa live
For what?
TheMaster: Hardest part I think would be doing good realistic airbending.
06,15Haha, oh man, that was a good night, Combustiblelemons :P
I still laugh every time I think about that night
What with air kinda being invisible.
no the real live movie
I believe
well you could just show the concentrated air or the effects of it blowing
I don't want to see that
I really with he does that again some other time
I love the real sow too much
Oh yes, it can be done, and it could be done well.
I want to make him do caramelldansen.
XD
Combustiblelemons: oh god yes
/me is listening to Pony Swag MEGAMIX
the advantage of that is that 1.aang is the only one who can. and 2. he doesn't airbend a whole lot
SWAG
(10th time today)
Is there a stream?
i wanted the mods doing skype stream to sing carameldansen
harharharhar
Would also require teaching the various actors proper martial arts.
thats true, and they hired the guy from kingdom of the crystal skull to do coreography
instead of the martial arts experts they had for the animated series
hey EmmettBrown
Home says we have Bladerunner for the 3rd week now :p
kingdom of the crystal skull: I was dissappoint.
What's sad is they had a proper martial artist helping them when they did all the animations in the cartoon.
Hi Dermathil
yeah dari needs to fix up that front page
oh, and instead of hiring people to just write real chinese caligraphy like in the series. they just scribbled fake chinese
that and they picked the right arts to fit each element
Sokka was awesome.
yeah the moive was terribad
and...we could talk forever about the racebending
I hope the fake chinese actually read something funy at one point
All I see is a spinning circle with a blue bit in it.
oh and espy I think I can find something you'll like
FRIENDLY MUSHROOM!
the stream isn't up yet
I know :p
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrYjhf98pqQ&feature=related awesome song in one of the movies tomorrow. Luna don't watch it. You'll just cry
06,15I love the picture memes from that night, too, Combustiblelemons
you know I think the casting call the ruined/set the tone for the entire avatar fiasco was the katara call.
oh this is new, theader is on top of the chat window again and zoom dose not fix it.
06,15Especially the "They told me I could become anything" pic :P
I wonder what I should do facts about this week.
whatever the girls name was. basically she got it because her dad was some millionare
>mfw next week It'll be officially the 6-month anniversary of my arrival in the Bronystate background
I made that one pinkie ^_^
as well as the "gryffindor" one.
06,15Haha, I know, I remember you telling me. It's still that awesome :P

But it's mainly poularized through YTP
true.
i know it's CDi
Hey everyone
I WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN WITH A COMBUSTIBLE LEMON!
LordCelestia
what dash said
These quotes are what ALL true warriors strive for!
-_-
"I'm the man who's gonna BURN your house down. With the lemons. I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon, that BURNS your house down!"
THAT
I'm stuck with this name forever :/
but its a good name....
That, mah boi
Is how you do it
inb4 someone makles a weegee quote
Oh god no, not weegee
Cave johnson lines get old fast.
It's a-me, Luiiiigi
Oh yes
You fools
*coughing fit* "The point is, if we can store music on a compact disk, why not store a man's intelligence?"
*foals
06,15I've been lucky enough to not get too much Portal 2 quoted at me
Mario Mario and Luigi Mario
Did you miss me?
Ive missed you.
06,15but then now here I am, and people are quoting Portal 2....
Let's do the Mario! Swing your arms. . .
RobotPinkie: Deploying smooth jazz in 3... 2... 1...
dat wall climb
Robotpinkie, you misspelled "unlucky"
from side to side!
/me stares at EspyLoopa
/me stares at Weegee
"Not that song."
"Don't look away, and most importantly, DON'T. BLINK.
06,15No, I definitely mean lucky, I enjoy it in the game :P
since I have this name for everything, someone makes portal 2 references daily to me.
06,15Played through it 5 times already, I think.
take on step, and then again
Blink, awesome episode
/me stares at herospirit
DIE.
5-6 times played through
COME ON, LETS GO, COME ON, DO THE MARIO!
Blink was my first DW episode :/
I swear, I've memorized almost every line from both Portal games...
/me counters the stare with The Mario
herospirit is turned to stone mid-dance
"No."
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65uNCLBTje0
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Super Mario Brothers Super Show Credits - Do the Mario!" - "Super Mario Brothers Super Show Credits - Do the Mario! Watch Mario dance like never before in the credits for the retro tv show!"
I've memorized how to complete every portal 2 level in the minimum amount of time
06,15Not sure what my first Doctor Who episode was, but it had Tom Baker in it....
*gasp* oh my god, what happened to herospirit!?
YOU CANNOT STOP ME
06,15...and it was the 80's, I'm pretty sure... :P
I've only actually seen 3 or 4 episodes. My little brother, of all people, introduced me to Dr. Who
"There is a pony farm at the bottom." "IM COMING FLUTTERSHY!!!!!!!!!" *Jumps into pit*
Denied_Existence Lol right?
my friends a big dr who fan so he talked about it every time a new one aired
I wish it came on at a time I could see it though :/
06,15You know what annoys me in Portal 2? No matter how fast I am, there's one level I'm not allowed to finish... :(
My little brother is obsessed with it..
speaking of TV shows, there was a new Big Bang Theory last night.
RobotPinkie, which one?
does the game bug out on you pinkie?
I can think of more than one level...
06,15The one that cuts short, to the escape.
actually, that one can be completed.
My iMac would never "bug out"
I'll be back later, when the stream's starting. So bye for now everyone.
the turrets don't explode so I get trapped and have to restart the game
bye Flutterguy
Cya Flutterguy
bye flutterguy
06,15Playing it on PS3, haven't gotten any bugginess, really
I play it on ps3 too, I think my discs scratched or something
06,15Aw, damn... :(
I never put discs away :P
06,15I hate scratched discs...
gonna drop stream here so it's clear for luna when she needs it soon.
ok
preshow and such
either that or it had a flaw in it's factory production
it's pretty hard to scratch a blu ray disc
I'm not really a console gamer, so I don't have to worry about scratched disks ^.^
WHAT WAS THAT FACE
wow, that emoticon looked really wierd...
06,15I don't think I have a single scratched game on PS3, though on 360... probably...
lol PS3 is awesome
i love it
06,15Old PSX games that are scratched, I have a lot more of. :P
*starts console war*
/me thros the first Gameboy
/me doesn't have a ps3
There is an easy way to resolve any console war:
I think the best era for games was around the early 2000s
With CDI
be a PC gamer instead
Concosle war bah we all know the PC is the best
CDI is best console
/me walks out
NO NOT THE CDi. IT BURNS.
YOU DARE BRING CDI INTO MY LAYER?
YOU MUST DIE
Dreamcast was best console.
nowadays its all graphics and FPS games T_T
Ohai Octavia
agreed 1000 times yes espy
13Hai thar
hey Octavia
Diablo III isn't a FPS.
ohai octavia
Hai
OCTAVIA, can I get your signature?
13I saw that LordCeleatia, thank you. :)
13I look so disgruntled though. XD
I'm your biggest fan
Well,
Where can we find out the movies for tonight?
I will strike you down demon hunter
http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
there's the Program
Octavia, i made you look indifferent to show how weird everyone else is acting to show your normalness (normal person would usually be annoyed by the shenannigans too)
So in a way, its a good thing.
/me bows "I aim to please Mylady
13Ah, I see.
Shenanigans is a funny word.
13I rather like the term Tomfoolery myself.
Actually, soon I'm going to figure out a way to put all the bronystate regulars into a picture together
06,15Best console of course is the Sega Genesis.
...Loopa?
No way!, SNES is best console ever
what have you been doing with tom the rock octavia?
XD
OMG i just realized its actually lacopa
xD
>yfw you don't know what I look like, LordCelestia
06,15Genesis 6-button controller is best controller of all time.
Best console is No console.
then tell me a pony-sona that you would look like
or upload one
Nnnng
I'll figure something out.
I have a ponysona :P
Would you not need pictures of them first LordCelestia ?
PS1 dual shock controller is best controller
so basically, regulars send in OC's to LordCelestia?
Yeah
basically, yes
Well, for me it's arcade sticks all the way
Yeah. to my email or my DA page
Mouse and keyboard is best controller.
already got my OC
Keyboard is nice for typing.
but no trackball mouses, please
for your oc, you used the Pony creator from a guy on DA?
06,15I love my PS3, but the Dual Shock isn't exactly the ideal controller :P
Might want to Poke a mod on that one LordCelestia
@DashOrCrash on FPS keyboard and mouse are the best of the best
I wonder if anyone entered the official MLP OC competition
I prefer Dualshock over X360's one
so you know it gets promoted.
poke a mod? why
I don't have an OC
I have a Ponysona already?
do I need permission or something?
I used that pony cerator to quickly to colour and perportion tests
So yeah, anyway, how long till BMN?
Dualshock is FTW
if you already have a ponysona, show me
but I draw my OCs
or send me it
anyone play MGS4?
I played it
I played it
Hey RobotPinkie, what irc client are you using?
did you kill psycho mantis?
No but if a mod is promoting it it would get every one to notice cause it would be during a +m or somthing =p
06,15Me too, MrPoniator, but I do think they could do better. Softer curves, more ergonomic design...
I beat errybody
so did I
Yeah, true
Ok if I use the Pony Generator on DA?
06,15X-Chat, Denied_Existence
well, I'm gonna go eat dinner and play minecraft until the stream.
They should take the sticks from the X360 pad
I have a lame one but it need more work hell I only have a crapy dolled version electronicly right now LordCelestia
Does that work on mac?
Those has a nice grip to them
Later, everyone!
06,15I think there's a port, yeah
I also saw the hidden picture where this kid uses his controller as a neck massager
Denied_Existence, get Colloquy if you're on Mac
06,15Hang, on, lemme check
cya in a bit DashOrCrash
the setting might be Celestias throne room with the cannon
is anything streaming?
or somewhere else
maybe the moon
It's the best Mac-based client, I'd say
it is RobotPinkie
who knows? :*
Lol wat r powneez
What about on the sun?
Ok if I use the Pony Generator on DA LordCelestia?
o_e
06,15Cant' promise it'll work, Denied_Existence, but here you go: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xchataqua/
Hey guys, in the actual show, is depressed Pinkie actually a different color, or is it just the lighting?
lighting i guess
Pony generator is a bit limited on hairstyles imo
Flaschen, if you do that, send me your pony code if you want to be posed
I'd still say that Colloquy over X-chat port if you're a mac user
06,15Oh, you might have a better version to link, then, Sumica. I'm not all that handy with OSX.
I found one for mac
It is xchat aqua, but slightly different
I drew mine. I reckon the wings a bit wrongly drawn though
Oh no clue if it's good i just know I saw a mac version.
LordCelestia im just going to send you the code as well, but i need to update my OC a bit
pegasi ponies are best ponies
ill be back later guys
gotta go do somerthing
Denied_Existence, Colloquy. I know you won't be dissapointed
I never bothered with mac cause i cant build one my self or at least could not at the time i picked.
06,15Hmmm, okay. I do like X-Chat quite a lot, personally.
It works!
Lemme switch over
06,15I use Linux though. :P
It doesn't take that long sumica to build your own OC
I use X-Chat and Irssi on my Win7 computer, but I just wish Colloquy was for Windows too
5 minutes max
Oh i did that some time ago Combustiblelemons
Howdy y'all
oh right
sorry, misunderstood what you typed
I think that's what step 3 no?
Oho, something be streaming.
Eugh, Halloween.

PINKIE AND THE BRAIN
so what are we watching
Yay
06,15Ohay Bjornfot
pinkie and the brain xD
DSNesmith: Kamen Rider THE FIRST
RobotPinkie!
It's always been that way for me Bjornfot I just use the links at the bottom.
Ahh I miss that show
Animaniacs FTW.
06,15<3
Bjornfot: It's because I'm changing things.
Refresh, clear your browser cache, restart your browser, whatever.
It's fixed now.
YES!
mk
=D
Classic
WHERE BE MAH PONY SWAG MEGAMIX?

derma, luna takes no requests atm
xD
dawwwwwwwww
ok, but you dun goofed on teh link now
oh the frames are sideby side again too, Nice Dari!
yay
the link to teh thatre is /theatre istead of ./theatre
>now using HydraIRC and popout stream
Bjornfot: ...What?
YES!!
another great one
YES YES YES!!
favourite song right here
The only link that's derped is the bottom 'theatre' one which you shouldn't need to use since you're already on that page.
which makes you go to ./theatre/theatre if you are in ./theatre
That reminds me I need to put this one on my phone
I'll fix that whenever.
still, it's ugly
Well, I have much more pressing issues to deal with.
I've always wondered what this song was
That's bottom of my list.
yeah, i can imagine
NARF!
this is awesome
Sumica, i got this on my mp3 and i listen to it every second throughout school
yeah I like that luna puts the video name in there now.
You must have pretty much to do if you're hiring tech people...
sumica ^ this
Filly, Gentlecolts ... you will allways remember the day where you allmost caught Captain Pinkie Pie!
emoshy =p
emoshy <3
Well I'm not always around, so having more than one person to deal with things would make it easier.
Man, I can barely remember any of Pirates of the Caribbean XD
omg im glad i ripped myself from uncharted 2
to come for this
07,0180.000 views
Yeah, like saturday... *cough*

Hey Polarfire.
ohai Derathil
*does the jensen dance*
and the idiots wont sell me borderlands or darksiders D:<
discord didnt ask for this
Hey Dari <3
Bjornfot: Naw, that's clearly intentional. See, they heard that you like theatres, so they put a theatre into your theatre so you can watch the stream while you're watching the stream.
Thunder_Dash: please click this link for the special events movie listings
Anoyone seen adam jensen doing the safety dance?
http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
It needs to be a thing. NOW.
on sunday, luna will also stream episodes 1 + 2 season 2
Ohh, okay
Thanks :)
his shuffle is in time with the music :D
OH DEAR GOD. THAT movie is being shown on Saturday? XD
you will need an email account to do so.
so many freaking movies this weekend =3
x3
And I was planning to catch up on work D:
i plan on atteding EVERY SINGLE ONE
That movie made me cry. xD
CosmicDashie cleared my weekend for this,
Me too
I don't think I'll sleep all weekend
lol me too dash
Which movie?
I'll do what I can
The Last Airbender.
Yeah
It's soooooo bad.
I haven't seen it yet
lol nt as bad as babes
and yeah I'm going to buy myself some energy drinks tomorrow
I hadn't even been aware that the Last Airbender had an anime.
can we veto it and have the finaly of the show please
The one scene I saw made me weep
babes was scary bad
x3
True, Dashie, but it is still pretty painful
hmm
it's more a westan animation with anime trates
westan
Combustiblelemons, do it hardcore mode = no caffeine/energy drinks
OH GOD!
ive never seen the last airbender
or sugar
Yeah, but it said AVATAR the Last Airbender
and i never watched the cartoon
Last Airbender? The M Night Shamalayan one?
Dashwithrainbows: nobody will like me without energy
yes Thunder_Dash
hey LordCelestia
The Cartoon is good
Oh boy... XD
Hi
I get... Very angry.
the moive is SHIT
I think the film's sheer SHITTINESS is best summarized by one scene in the movie, and I will point it out during the stream tomorrow.
The earthbending one?
Is the stream going now?
it like they took the very base of the cartoon and made it bad
okay then you better buy some E.D then lemons
pre-show LordCelestia
ooh, imma watch!
I wasn't offended since Toph wasn't in it.
Gabe: YES.
grr darn you bronystate u guys make me lose sleep between movie nights house and my ps3.... arrgh
Well it was only book one Tovler
That scene made me sad
but its worth it
So, discord shuffle: a meme or a temporary fad.
decide.
meme
xD
That scene was an insult to the audience's intelligence.
mem
fad.
Fad.
Temporary fad I'm thinking.
I still cant belive they put that song in a Car ad.
meme
YES
Fad
Yep, and she's never gonna be in the movies.
TIM CURRY IS PERFECT
I think I just broke cleverbot...
2,14 haha! Came back just in time for RHPS! YES!
AND THIS FITS PERFECT!
Simply because it's part of the first episode of season 2.
It might make meme
Woo!
07,01indeed it does
He would have made a good Discord voice, too.
whoa this is perfect.
Oh my Gods, this is... I have no words
hey val
But yeah. Will save it for the stream, so as not to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie. :p
2,14 hello
crap. I just realized I didn't get my Discord singing Toxic Love.
06Tim Curry <3
Dash is like -_-
val did you do the rarity newsletter? =D
But that scene in particular is where I almost left the movie
This song is hilarious :D
06,15Ohay ValtheJean
2,14 I did indeedf :P
2,14 indeed even
(and I've never walked out on a movie, but that one got me awfully close)
So, where be we sending in requests tonight?
/me claps for val
HI VAL!
another smashing job
2,14 hai sumica
=D
2,14 why thank you cosmic :D
is it me are are ponies slighty creepy dead on
so very happy I saw the rocky horror show with you guys :P
Hi Val
2,14 hello thunder_dash
07,01RHPS was awesome
but val i has one question
2,14 it's always nice to hear your work is appreciated :P
2,14 oh?
Y U NO USE RAINBOW DASH
RHPS is always AWESOME
06,15Indeed it was, Luna
xD
2,14 RBD was one of our previous newsletters :P
o
The ponies do look too human when staring at them face front.
aww
i missed it
2,14 we haven't even gone through half of the available ponies for our newsletters :P
sadface
06,15Kinda too bad we didn't have this to play then.
well i wont miss another one =D
Val, I'm waiting on that Caramel edition :P
i love your work on them newsletters
2,14 glad to hear it :P
RHPS was so bizarre it was amazing, IMO
Rainbow dissapproves of transvestites.
yes the newsletters look realy good.
2,14 lol RDash, I have the template, but I doubt the others would approve of my using it :P
I need to sing up to them
2,14 thanks sumica :D
lol
Yes, this song
also... WHERE IS GHOSTIES??? D:
WEIRD AL
2,14 how appropriate, given the movie tonight :P
Yeah
YES!
thinking the same ValtheJean
Oh that reminds me Weird Al concert on comidy central this weekend.
He said Lord. yeay
Luna: We should play the "Discord, Agent of Chaos" vid.
Lordin' over the accordion
Really wish we get that possable Werid Al cameo in FiM
yeah same
love this one
That might be too much
LEO!
Nah done well could be awesome
I want it to fit not be forced though
Weird Al in MLP:FiM would be awesome.
well yeah every thing if done well is awsome
06,15Me too, Dumori
Especially if he took part in a song.
zomg how am i supposed to be a groupie without ghosties??
Sumica, he said he'd be okay with doing a cameo if he was asked
just cant see them pulling it off with out forcing it.
They did Q
sumica: they might surprise u
Werid Al is nothign to that...
I doubt that they'd cameo him in same failed way that the Simpsons usually do it.
True they did pull of Q by making hime the focus of 2 eps. and it was great.
so then according to my horoscope, I'll find my head on a stick? ....k
lol

Love that line
No matter if i win A or B, i choose Shaun of the Dead. :P

David Bowie made this movie awesome. all the parts without his are just sort of meh.

06,15Though if I ever win B-movie pick, you're in for some awesome....
so my selection from last week will be shown next week, thats good to hear
06Combustiblelemons: THE ICE MAN COMETH! >D
Why is that RobotPinkie?
Wickerman is being saved for a special occasion payne
2,14 >implying any B movie choice could be better than mine
Don't you dare, GabeMoist! lol
I may have to go into exile for that though...
Combustiblelemons, relly?

Really, I was not aware of that...
06,15That would be an awesome troll.

Well then I have huge list of movies.
Next week it'll have been SIX MONTHS that I'll be having Cube as my B movie pick. I'm one patient bastard.
yeah, I was mad
I picked wicker man
Bjorn knows how to troll for b movies
Suddely thiking we may need to amend the worst movie rule.
and they're like lolnope
Well, I was gonna pick something good, but since babies in toyland apaprently beat me...
Wait, is the lottery tonight?

07,01no lottery this week
Herospirit, lottery is next week
i aim to
06Slap that baby~

/me didn't see a single freaking babe in toyland
Aight.
Transformers (80's Version) would be my choice
Happy half-birthday Bronystate!
i didn't see it either
Banings for the people that pick the movies that make it in to worst movie =p
And I thought spiders web was bad.
I was thinking I might go for one of the animated titanic movies instead of Star Wars for B movie, but I may not be allowed back for those movies...
tacowiz has been redeemed
gabemoist, please, no
no one deserves those
2,14 >implying I'm not waiting to find out who voted for Babes so I can ban them
where is tacowiz nowadays, anyway?
That would be WehPie, Valthejean
or MehPie
not sure which
ohai LunaTheForgotten
val, we're backing you on that ban decision
2,14 I WILL FIND THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Plan 9 from outer space would make a good B-movie though.
I'm not
I'm back just in time.
xD
I do not support this
worst part is that they didn't even watch it with us
I love this PMV.
YESH!
Hi dermathil.
NIGHT OF PONY

06,15Don't be so mean to whoever picked it, ValtheJean :P
they picked that awful movie and left us alone to watch it
oi mellow song to a 200bpm song.

Okay then my B movie is either Soylent Green or Lord Of War
Crazy japanese. lol
Gay Niggers From Outer Space!
Damn japan, you crazeh!

Transformers (80's Version) for B-Movie!
The Room is what all true B Monies strive for!

DCD, we just attributed the 7 deadly sins to ponies.
Are we bad people? :0
:P
yo lag, remember streaming preshow at school once?
MYSTERIOUS AS THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON
BEYATCH
You applied 7 sins to 6 ponies.
GENIUS
Since 2004, Japan, China, India, the United States, and the European Space Agency have each sent lunar orbiters.
we added Spike
And one Dragon, of course
spike is 7th pony
:D
:( Last pizza of the year for me.
we must do that again lag
oh heya DCD glad to see you made it
Spike is rainbow dash
spike fits well for lust.
THE DARKSIDE OF THE MOON ISN'T MYSTERIOUS
so you counted her twice.
YES!
wooooo

ten bucks says there's a comment that says "thumbs uf if you tried to close the Magneto sd"

Yes i do...
06,15Pretty sure it was a mystery in the 15th century, EmmettBrown....
that was funny
Who else was there while they did this?
So much lultz were had :P
I was here when it happened
RBD!
Silverscreen,I did just try to.
Be nice RobotPinkie. Some questions are mysterious at times. :P
gayest straight boyfriend ever

Nah,I'm sure the chinese built a firework to the moon or something
So this is where the Magneto thing came from.
indeed Dashite
Ah now I can see the video :)
magnetos minions XD
xD
Aponymous: Nope
The one thing it was missing was a pony named Magneto!
#join
06,15Chinese astronaut myth was awesome on MythBusters....
Magneton is best Pokemon
are we gonna see magneto in season 2?
The Magneto came from one of the analysis of the scenes.
I saw that too robotpinkie
/me plays original pokemon.
CLONE ARMY!
dari: you are mistaken
nope
It didn't come from it
the girl is a closet brony
/me wants to play Pokemon Stadium but doesn't have his N64 anymore QQ
The "Evolution of a Scene" was a reference to the meme
it started here dari
Into the gala, metal things~
06,15You're stealing my schtick, I'm the one who plays Emerald during pre-stream :P
Emerald!?
pokemon?
Sorry, my Robotnik-fandom comes up again. When I see Emerald I automatically think I must have it.
scootaloo =D
awesome.
I actually just found my Pokemon Yellow the other day.
Ooh good, I like this one
Designer jeans, lol
06,15Pokemon Emerald... right here on my GBA SP, yup.
So Magnetos how do they work?
Magic
Magic
Emerald was the best.
It's not a Chaos Emerald RobotPinkie. Bored now. :P
Yellow was best.
Combustiblelemons that is so true
06,15Getting bored of space?
I'm sad, because my PokÃ©mon Emerald didn't saves anymore )'=
Pokemon black and white ran out of steam.
/me is so hungry =(
Magnetos work like Cheetos
My crystal Doesnt save anymore...
plus I hate 90% of the new pokemon
My GBC Silver doesn't save anymore.
D
Neither
*XD
06,15Aw, that's sad LunaTheForgotten :(
Which sucks, I absolutely loved Silver
This is awesome.
White was my favorite. I feel alienated since 99% of people disagree.
It was so much fun when it did save though.
MY GBC doesn't work...
lol
And DS lite can't play the old games...
I still have an original GB
I cant find my gba charger >_<
I've got TWO GBCs.:P
eats so many batteries...
It'd be like that carlsberg joke with the bikers.
i lost my SP :(
/me is glad she still has original DS.
I lost my charger for my SP
T_T
Grape whistles
Wow./
Love is........whistles
...this one's a bit TOO blunt for my tastes.
IM GOING TO GRAPE
I think that's a worser feeling
My SP just quit working one day.
YOU*
Excadrill is the most badass pokemon (raises shields)
I don't mind political incorrectness, but this just seems to be incorrect for the sake of it.
nope latios is badass OMP
YES
<3
Magneto is best pokemon.
IMO*
Mind you, perhaps I'm just too serious.
Garchomp, y u so fast?
oh this
That was the point, Lasharus XD

07,01>mfw 20 mins...
Luna
So,I blended Luna with rainbow dash,and the moon suddenly cahnged into this! http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Aitken_Kagu_big.jpg

your such a grapist
It has Prison in it
I was about to ask are we going to listen all of it?
My favorite Pokemon was always was Lapras.
oh goodlord 20 min?!
20 mins of my ears bleeding rainbows...
....At list I think it was

Yeah, this is a 20 min megamix
This is some good swag.

thanks luna
awwww
06,15Torchic is best.
suddenly rarity
While this is a great song, it is just too long
that is alot of rairty
so much swag
Time for potty break then.
How long is the pre show?
But I want to hear Pogosama still. he's awesome.
I'm gonna call my creation a SONIC RAINMOON
Another reason why White version is the best: Cloyster went from meh to AMAZING
not a fan of pony swag.
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Aitken_Kagu_big.jpg :D
Cloyster was a B***H to beat.
I got Black :P
Cloysters a freaking asshole...
i got every ds pokemon game :x i just love pokemons
I always OHKO'd cloyster.
REMIX AIR HORN
Pony swag is uncanny. So much effort went into this song.
The last Pokemon game I bought was Pokemon Sanp for 64.
*snap
I wish I could collect so much things like I did with PokÃ©mon
You should buy some more.
ibringdalulz is awesome
Ta Gallade with leaf blade but if he was nknked out i had nothing...
POKEMON SNAP! I remember that. So much fun.
BRB.
*I mean MLP FiM stuff
I should really find a way to turn the moon back to it's original colour
the mane 6 would be my ultimate pokemon team
Psh, I still watch the damn anime.
swagberg is awesome
I already caught flutershy in a pokeball
@MeteorVenture pokeponies! nice
But the new anime sucks...
there msut be a pony parody of montgomery mini mall.
must*
PROTIP: there's a cresent moon outside right now
pokemon firered/leafgreen elite 4: my lapras saved my team from certain wiping.
everyone is awesome
There's one of the rappers that sound creepy, but apart from that they're almost all awesomely good.
xD
Not in canada
Anything after season 5 of Pokemon sucks
its late afternoon here :P
(Which was the end of Johto)
07,01enough swag?
no
Ya im good
enough.
That's an opinion
more swag!
xD
Next song please
I'm gonna saaaaaaay.... yes.
Less swag
moar!
I'm using a huge torch,mirror and telescope to see the south pole of the moon.
enough
**has sound muted**
06,15I just don't think the other people on this megamix are as good as Maros or Swagberg....
But then, I'm a 60's music man, not exactly rap. :P
I have this on my ipod
im good
awh
agreed, robotpinkie, but there are a couple of them that are pretty good
RP, I actually think pogosama is the best in the gang.
this again :3
/me yay
oh well
also, LAST VERSE is awesome
Galaaaaa
I hope nothing bad happens when south park makes a parody of fim.
wait... we saw this already
this is all good
ALSO, Y WE WATCHING THIS AGAIN
im confused
This song is awesome. Who cares?
07,01request Derma :)
Which still doesn't explain why it is now a SONIC RAINMOON
Oh this one's great
does she say "care for a diamond" at the beginning?
I do decect som Pirates influence on this one.
I love this.
Lots of bad things will happen if Matt Stone And Trey Parker are involved...
my favourite of all time
Reruns aren't an issue unless they request babes in toyland.
Detect*
In which case guns shall get involved.
06,15Yeah a couple of them are alright, but I think there's a gap in general between quality from one verse to the next.
also, Luna, I thought maybe the megamix could've been played in the post-show so moar time available
...Didn't we play this earlier?
oh no.... south park better not parody mlp
I play this when i practice with my cutlass.
07,01i'll see what I can do...
or we will be done for
yes EspyLacopa but its so awesome it needs to be replayed
But SP is awesome...
i really dislike south park
hey Spazturtle
This reminds me of lonely island for some reason
... The upcoming Luna episode is basically a remix of the Zecora episode? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about Season 2.
If South Park Parodies MLP, that only solidifies the fandom and spreads it even more.
sp better stay 100ft away from mlp and bronies
I miss when South Park was funny.
No-one wants to help me fix my sonic rainmoon?
LONLEY ISLAND
Tovler, NO SPOILERS.
06,15I dunno, I don't see why they'd parody MLP
SOMEONE REQUEST IT
Im lazy...
They parody a lot of suddenly popular things RobotPinkie.
why are there no lonely island pmvs D:
South Park's WoW parody's already become legendary.
ya there is
Besides, they'll most likely poke at the fandom rather than the show itself.
They might want to continue on that.
there is?
Highly likely Silverscreen.
Where's my pony WoW parody
Well,the Brony culture took off when south park was in it's mid season break,so they haven't noticed it yet
no sign of Sethisto posting anything yet, guys?
So what's up? Anyone know when the movies are starting?
I'm watching them ASAP
2,14 none whatsoever
South park parodies popular stuff all the tim
well on oct 5th we get more SP
06,15Yeah, true, but the WoW parody wasn't really disrespectful as such.
Have not seen any thing DCD
so well see
Dari would give us an update
DERP: 8PM EST so half an hour
Hey DCD, did anyone send the message to Sethisto?
2,14 yes derma
1am for UK bronies out there!
Duly noted RobotPinkie.
South Park to me, just ...is. I barely even think about the episodes.
whew
DCD: Thanks... so what's on tonight, anyway?
Not it isn't!
I hope I can stay awake for all of this
Derp, KAMEN RIDER THE FIRST
And who knows, perhaps if they parody MLP, they'll do something similar.
>portrays WoW players as obese nerds with no lives
http://i51.tinypic.com/35iyu10.jpg
/me brohoofs DashWithRainbows
>not disrespectful
It's half 12
Theres a shy ronnie pmv
that said it was still hilarious
:D
ah those old promos
I'm guessing emmett suggested this
filly to the future =o
I come back to a great parody.
/me nods
It's not so much a parody of WoW as much as a parody of the general view of gamers DSNesmith.
lol
yeah they did
But Sethisto posts BronyState events half an hour after they start like 95% of the time
Only two more years till hover skateboards! Yay!
RAINBOW DASH IS THE DELOREAN
IT WORKS ON SO MANY LEVELS
y does seth not watch bronystate?
06,15I think that's a fairly accurate portrayal of some of the more die-hard WoW-players, DSNesmith|afk :P
or u could try sending to phoe or cereal
Oy, RobotPinkie, I've been playing WoW for over 6 years now. I'm not obese, thank you ever so much. :P
Back to the Future.
phoe and cereal would be less busy
http://arch.413chan.net/88_MPH-(n1305317365454).jpg
Or you could send it to the mooooon
Oooo, Kamen Rider. I think one of those was shown here before. If it's what I'm thinking of it was... interesting
I know mad from cn already made a parody of fim.
I was fat before I started gaming.
Black to the Future
trololol
NO
wait,
YES
Oh YES!
i guess we already skipped the topic but imo south park just seems like a bunch of edgy stuff for shock value that isn't even shocking
13Trolololol
06,15Haha, read again, Lasharus, I'm not saying ALL WoW players are like that... Besides, every WoW-player I know thought the SP parody was hilarious.
This meme died when Family guy parodied it
And I know this pony maplejack started to get popular lol.
I suggested this
yayayayaya yayaya yayaya hohohohoho
Be greatful you foals
06,15None of them took offense :P
:P
Grateful*
trololololol
E/I trolled the trollers by not allowing them to troll.
/me plays WoW almost every day :|
Yeah, so did I RobotPinkie, and I know you didn't intend to call me obese. But I'm good at randomly taking offense for comedic effect.
the WoW SP episode was hilariousw
And by that last statement, I completely ruined it...
:P
ive never played wow
:p
/me has many 85's and 80's >.>;
one of my favourite episodes.
Me neither
I've played WoW going on 4 years and i found that episode hilarous.
Octavia: You finish the Firelands yet?
The only way this meme could be saved from the Family guy effect is if the guy sang it again
I don't play wow.
13No. lol
just FYI
13I just got back into WoW a little bit ago.
06,15I'll play along with the joke next time, Lasharus :P
NOOOOOO
eeeeeeeeee
NOT OCTAVIA!
13Yup!
Fair enough.
But I do think the priest tier 13 looks nice.
woooooooo i get pizza again
Favorite weapon is Zin Rokh, Destroyer of Worlds.
I stay away from MMORPGs as much as possible
brb guys
WoW, WoW everywhere.
Trololololo
In that case, i'd best prepare a WHOPPER of an insane fit.
last thing i want is to be addicted
13I was playing WoW during vanilla, BC and Wrath too. I was hawt in Wrath. Downed the LK on heroic 25m. :P
inb4 20+ hour days of one of the MLP MMOs
2,14 omg me too tavi!
I'll see if I can get pizza for tomorrow :D
I'm impressed Octavia.
LordCelestia. Remember. I suggested just video just for you and Trollestia
We got fairly far, but didn't quite manage LK heroic.
Lol
Everyone was baddass in LK
Only managed heroic 10m LK. :/
inb4 a nyx pony in the fim mmo
Never really got into the raiding scene in WoW myself.
Too much work, not enough fun.
i need to read that fanfic.. really

07,01How are you all?
Meanwhile, you're a jerk.
I like how I absolutely know all the words of this polka, yet have heard manybe one of the original songs.
Trixie reminds me of people i hate.

The off-beat emphasis. Used a lot in funk and such.
Applejack gets a lot of screen time already
/me hopes this special BMN is gonna cheer him up.
she still seems 1 dimensional though :/
Canis Miner
makes you kinda want to snap the fingers.
She isn't.
Oh alright, I rememeber
06,15Yeah but she hasn't had an episode about how awesome she is, Combustiblelemons :(
Discord do want
It's awesome
Tf2 needs more ponies.
that's true pinkie
yes it does
inb4 20% cooler
Tf2 needs more blenders.
I like the vocal harmony at the end of the song
Back.

/me gives blenders to everyone!!!

It's like looking at the arc
Wait! isnt that fly guy from "spider riders"??

Reading: The bane of existence then Silverscreen?
Water crystals save the day!
And then snow gingerly fell on Hoppa's head

No video links
Everyone should watch Watership Down as a child.
ok...he's not suicide guy anymore...so he'll be kamen copy-guy i guess
Sonic X is a good example, even though the original version was fairly shitty to begin with. :P
13No, we havent played Watership Down yet. :P
power rangers failed after the original series
he just tried to jump the roof, NOO NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM OR RESTRAIN HIM IN ANY WAY
watership down, traumatizing children since 90-whatever
Disney shoveled it into crappy time slots

Power Ranger will never die.
