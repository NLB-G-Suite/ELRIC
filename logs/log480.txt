Fun Fact: A straight man is a word for a person in a two person comedic team who is supposed to be the serious person.
00,10oh yeah
05,15Last thing we need is some soccer mom getting angry with us
04We need a ToS, absolutely

Gamer_Luna: Erm...I was love sick...
00,03mmmhmm
05a yes to gettign a ToS.

Om: :[
11,01Yeah.

0,5yesyesyesyes
pikorar: How the fuck does my relationship work with anypony then? :D
pikorar: now I know
0,14works for me, how would we implement it though?
Irish_Pony: Something a matter?
i knew pikorar
That ornage thing on their table looks like a Trapinch.
11,01But aren't those legal documents?
basically: connect to the stream, agree to the ToS
O_O?
orange*
I learned that from taking the SAT.
04At the beginning of every log in to #bronystate?
/me activates lurk mode
wha?

...OMG YES http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-pokebenders.jpg
COOKIES
The SAT actually taught me something rather than just testing me.
cookie aye
so, what did i miss in last 2 hours bronies?
the logistics can, of course, be handled later
ohai Alicorn_Prince_Shane and Dken2021

sorry Eddmario
nice wheels
good, that's all for that
hai Magical_pablez94 :D
How do those wheels work :O?
that's all for my points
04Could we possibly include the rules in the ToS
magic
More hot things
So that's how Derpy drove sideways.
Gamer_Luna: well Ninjazz told me you missed me, and something else <3
whoa there pikorar
absolutely
04So then THEY'D HAVE to look at them
11,01Yes.
05aye
I may have missed this.. but what was the response on resourcing?
it also means if they got kicked
pikorar: Do I really have to say it? :D
pikorar: i haven't in last 4...:D
they'd have to re-read it
05but we will still have them on the separate place
hey Alicorn_Prince_Shane hows your day been
11,01So they have zero excuse for rule ignorance.
alexxm: having just woken up awesome atm
Reminds me of the Auto Axe from the Fallout 3 DLC The Pitt
Depends on what you're trying to say, GilDash.
Luna: if people feel like they aren't being organized well, they're instructed to tell the admins
all the testosterone
Irish_Pony: What did he tell you?... <3
lol indeed
Um.
thanks Val
/me hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane
I get freaked out if I don't have a haircut every 3 weeks.
GilDash: so, how r ya?
Gamer_Luna: He told me you liked me... <3

FUUUUUUUUU- Time out...

fun fact: blue eye color is not really blue.
Gamer_Luna: <3

Alicorn_Prince_Shane: O.o
pikorar: My hair is beatiful. Well. I think it is.

The stream is probably 7 seconds behind anyway...
nonono listen
Irish
what? free kids? where
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: 22:25 am.. x)
00,10but we have no way to enforce either
or,,
the agreement is that they are either of age, or have permission to log on
RAWRity: Boomer
lol we're watching commercials? :D
10:25 pm* xDDD
RAWRity: I'd hit that. WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER!
so in other words
Irish_Pony: <3
RAWRity is that supposed to be misty
Airpuff: how is it 2225 am
04If they say they are of age
And then he kills 2 hookers.
they agree to know what they're getting into
04But aren't

alexxm: eeyup
04Then they're the ones that fucked up

04...but how do we enforce that?
who does pikorar
Gamer_Luna: Btw did you see what I drew for you on your DA? <3
did she say jaffa cakes?
we dont
After this myth busters I may just get a bubble wrap fetish.
04It's not like we have a legal team...
it's just a measure to protect ourselves
05but by stating it
thanks RAWRity
its just frustrating
pikorar: I'll go find some for you. ;)
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Im not useally using Am/Pm.. only 00:00 - 23:59 :P
pikorar: .....k lol\
00,10we have them identifie a picture of VHS tapes
05they know what they are gettign themselves into
1,11We've always had that overhead. Only know we'd be protected from it.
Mmmmm... So bubbly. Pop pop pop all night, baby.
We just write down a ToS and have a button that says "I agree to the ToS"
Airpuff: k
I thought I found the problem with the HDTV but no it was not
hey Gamer_Luna i saw your pic, its very nice ^_^
pikorar: I'd rather be popping cherries. ;)

Irish_Pony: No,I'll go check :)
/me wraps pikorar in bubble wrap

some caps most likely went bad
adam is now a discord worshiper

I liked the alcatraz myth they did
00,10hard to tell beta from vhs with out sence of size
GilDash: That's just rude.
okay, but now the discussion is done, we're good

Invi: Advertising within the channel's own shows?
no i meant i wanted mythbusters
er.. Mythbusters!
Fun fact: Bringing pick-up trucks to a biker gang fight is a good idea.
YES
that's so true
Wrek: because Dead Space was the first work of fiction that used a lullaby on a horror situation :D
00,10Man of the team only find out about upcoming events around the time the viewers do

this isnt CoD
How do you guys do that?
Wrek: :P
I love me some juice... ;)

CoD isn't this
yes
If I was the leader of a biker gang I would just drive a pick-up truck with bullet proof glass because no one would expect it.
00,10We need to be posting events on the fourms so every one knows one is coming up
GilDash: it looks like they didn't me my help btw :D
Kari does have nice mellons
Invi: Your guess is as good as mine.

aaaaaaaaannnnnnndddddddddd iiiiitttttttttt
Princess_Molestia it's Sumica's ping noise
!yay
Dat 100 XXX! times
00,10I read through srs many of the events in the last 2 months never came up at all
no more "Fun police"
ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
pffff, built a 12.7mm pistol, then i'll be impressed
Princess_Molestia: the streamer has a diffrent noise for when she is pinged
MELONS
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/epic-fail-x-ray-fail.jpg <- How did someone even manage that
hell, if you really want to, do fun police in G
lemons
KIWIS
GilDash: what about the 2 of us? :D
Shamroc: he
This totally proves she's a lesbian.
I see now
WAT?!
Insert_cupc4ke: Someone get a DNA sample. I'll grab a TARDIS and go forwards in time to when cloning people is easy.
Grapefruit
melons make for good armor
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: derp
Strawberries
We'll each have our own Kari
hi Princess_Molestia how's ur day been? :)
Apples
BOOM
This myth test is stupid. It's a waste of perfectly good watermelon
We have a new body armour... made of melons!!!!!!!
Oranges
it all goes back to communication
It feels as if they had to do way more work just for this episode than a "normal" episode :D
I would eat those watermelons and instead of spitting out a black seed, I would spit out a bullet.
communicate
Eddmario indeed
^
Dat magic o.o
if people don't respond
Kumquats
It's been good
no, you can still eat the melons.
don't give up
KEEP reminding them
Magical_pablez94: I have tryed EVERYTHING! He has listened to 3 episodes Lesson Zero, Party of One, and Swarm of The Century. He has also listened to two songs Winter Wrap Up and Smile Smile Smile. Well the thing is he really wasen't paying attention and he said it count's as watching when he just LISTENED to them and wasen't paying attention. He's freakin 16 and he can act below has age alot. He can't even sit still
They should keep shooting
Bananas
put it in different channels
/me dat wall of text
do what you need to do to get it out there
Papaya
pikorar: o///o
Im waiting for my friend Tax to come back.
pikorar If you can spit them hard enough, you could kill a amn
you can still eat the watermelons
*man
Mangos
lol cover ur self in watermelons
I have alot to say somtimes! :$
13awards show was brought up a week and a half before the deadline, so it moved very fast to getting that committee of me and kirz and saxy
the melon has wounds
there's still some good watermelons
dat bullet
Princess_Molestia: happy to hear :D
Holi cow.
00,10I presum all the events are at some point brought to the admins yes.
That's better than in my dreams
xD
OHHHHHHHHH
Eddmario: I'm not a spitter, actually. Spitters are quitters.
Tomatoes
04You'd think that...
pikorar: I'd rather you spit out seeds... ;)
13trilogy was just an off the wall idea i had on the list i hammered out, but we're at june, suddenly it's happening
they should be, yes
ideally: this is how it should work:
Peaches
a team comes up with an idea for an event
GilDash, what did I just say!? Spitters are quitters! >:L
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/epic-fail-nevada-has-its-priorities1.jpg
Ponies47 i can't rellay sit still but i'm a brony
the Teamleader brings it up in the TL chat
pikorar: Hey, I'd be there to mop it back up. ;)
Pears
we discuss it, the admins present it in SRS and the forums
Of course the bulls didn't break the dishes; dishes aren't me
we get the organization handled IMMEDIATELY
04Ideally
Ponies47: you made a big mistake. u should make him watch the FIRST episodes not some of them taken randomly...
Limes
Kari has a nice hole there
02Well, got to go everyone~
oickaxing
00,10Yeah that's kinda another point Shizuka but it's not on the ajenda
02Nini~
*pickaxing
GilDash: ... With your tongue. *TKFW*
I'm pretty sure the Chinese Digger myth was that they'd put vases on a table and if they fell over then someone was digging underneath
Palmagranates
Is it possible to shoot a Barret 50. cal through a 10 foot thick block of ice?
bai
nope
Cherries
xD
pikorar: That's the idea. ;)
Magical_pablez94: Yeah but here's the thing. He really didn't watch them or listen infact I don't think he was paying attention at all.
Princess_Molestia hows your day been
good alexxm
Grapes
00,10too much planing seems to happen at the last min. we keep pushing things back
D'aaaaw!
XD
TOO many commercials
Goats are so silly!
agreed
Tangerines
13from my point of view, let's face it, the forums are deaaaaaaad
oh wait thats not a commercial?
00,10yeah
05oh look our human side is showing
GilDash pikorar: Get a room.
11,01Our normal forums?
nope
I like male bags.
not the beer!
Cantelopes
no why the beer
13yeah mod foums
WHY ARE THEY WASTING BEER?! :[
waste of good beer
NO! NOT MY BEER!!!!
13forums is spelled with an R.. but anyway
A waste of beer...
pikorar: what does that mean?
/me cries
13we all have skype open all the time, so naturally that's where our discussion takes place
is this some kind of cruel joke?
wow, a lot of ads here
We like this room, Om, because it's more spacious.
NOT THE BEES
Ponies47: cause he doesn't know what he's watching at... he just knows that's a cartoon for little girls that casually likes to his brother...
Lemons
/me kisses Irish_Pony.
NOOO! NOT THE CANS OF-Wait, it's beer? Never mind then.
well, this is a committment thing essentially
that boy needs therapy
I am a shark, GIVE ME YOURE VIRGINS!!
they could have given the beer to me
if we want to forums to live
GilDash: i wondered the same... :'(
Raisins
GilDash it's for science. science created beer and destroys it again
yes but with the amount of offtopic chat in there
PinkiePry: o hai
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/21402779.jpg
we need to use them
Should play pony music while commercials
lolwut
oh crap PinkiePry is here
SRS chat is no longer SRS
obviously, we can't make any of you use them
CCCP: Whatever you want it to ;)
I am the epitome of alone
Invi: That's a sin!
11,01The forums can be used to storm things.
stuff gets missed out on
wut?
04How about
pikorar: O_O
11,01*store
true
GilDash not if it's shitty beer
pikorar: I think I've got a good idea. ;)
ohai PinkiePry! how have u been?
04We just don't make Skype for BronyState business
PinkiePry: nuthing <_< >_>
04Make forums just BronyState business
hi PinkiePry
Gouda
00,10I dont mind chat taking place in skype so long as we keep the important bits saved on the fourms
Invi: ... Okay, you kinda have a point there.
yes please
TOO MUCH DMAN ROLEPLAY
:D
Why the hell does anyone live in AK?
I would vouch that
*DAMN
what am I watching.
I've been here for hours -_-
13forums are too slow for all the communication though
hi everypony, how are you this fine evening?
Dat slow mo
roleplay is fun though.
allo AlienEd27, good
04But then the unnecessary bits are filtered out, Shizuka
well, as Nittany said
Hi AlienEd27! I love you!
/me is the next level of performance
11,01Things can go slowly in Skype as well.
atleast PinkiePry is normal
the forums are used to STORE the information
hey AlienEd27
^
we should have a RP day
1,11forums are for finalized business. Skype is for discussing that business.
if something is discussed on skype, we store it on the forums
Bollocks I need caffiene
all of them have sexy face
good idea
CCCP: nope
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: normal?
04Funny
13which is what we had threads and such to do
Magical_pablez94: True. THt's what all none bronies think. I just don't know how to make him sit down and just watch a freakin episode.
CCCP: I'm not RPing.
Airpuff: shhhhh
pikorar: love ALL the things
13but we haven't used them have we?
05i like the philosophy better. the forums STORE info. the skype discusses it
04I made that already for the forums :D
*That's
11,01Hence my point.
MY MOUTH! THE CRYSTALS DO NOTHING!
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: :S
pikorar: i know
"Blowers"
05that*
ask him nicely?
Ze Goggle Do Nothing!
Bromance much pikorar? 6_9
13we've all had access to the forums this whole time, but like i said, they're dead or dying
The word "love" is getting played out, I may move to admire later, much more sensual.
drug him and tie him to a chair?
04I already made a "BronyState Important Business" thing way back
well then, let's commit
yep
right now, let's commit
04Where people would put down important info
check the forums regularly
pikorar: Well, you're the muppet playing it out. :p
lolsolsols
lsol
oh no
infront of a tv that plays nothing but mlp?
;s
what Pajaro
Irish_Pony: Almost done :)
04And what's the punishment if you don't check the forums regularly?
AlienEd27: Whatever "mance" you think it is.
03o.o
!pokemon
nothing.
04That's the thing, how do you make people check the forums
Bronystate fails
Gamer_Luna: Cant wait <3
plan and simple
00,10again with the punishment
Bork bork bork!
pikorar: I like you saying "love" , don't change it :(
no need for punishment
04Seriously though, Sumi
we can't run the site if people aren't committed
00,03>RP day
0,5No punishment
/me rolls
it's peoples OWN responsibility
Ponies47: tell him about the story without saying the word PONY then make him watch the first episode with you near to him, making a commentary about the quality of the cartoon and things like that :D
hey, at least you still have your vocal chords
00,03lolnope
04Why have all these things if there is no reason for people to do it?
to be INFORMED
pikorar: Wark wark wark!
/me is socialy awkard
04Why enforce rules then?
04If you do nothing, then people will do whatever
doo dee doo
the guys who need voice prothesises are kinda more fucked
0,14Except even when people are reminjded to check the forumsl, they don't
/me hugs Aliened27
AlienEd27: I am too
04^
WORT WORT WORT! HALO FTW!!
04Exactly
GilDash: Ctrl-F. Quick Replace: "r" with "n". Enter.
13negative reinforcement is vastly inferior to positive reinforcement
04What would make them do something
AlienEd27: think you are not alone with that here ;)
05yes but i dont think there's a lack of committment val, jsut a lack of urge to use the forums
Do they really need to show this same Mythusters commercial again adn again?
04Saying "Please, guys, check forums" wouldn't work
/me hugs AlienEd27
13you set up a situation where we resent visiting the forums just as a way of avoiding punishment
AlienEd27, MahBoi777 Dont worry. Not all in here are.. at that level xD
i guess everypony is then!
how the fuck do you do that
then what would you suggest wrek?
Acleps yes
Gamer_Luna: Ill brb, Ill miss you <3
04Then, tell us, what would you suggest Shizuka
pikorar: It's no fun on your own. ;)
you agreed to the philosophy, so why not do it?
dat science
Myth Busted. Just like all the cherries in the world.
light beer and regular beer? lol
13pastebin, profuse use of pastebin
face plant
04Ummmm
If they throw whisky I will be really ticked off.
Airpuff: lol ya'll are fine, I mean irl
13have everyone make or link accounts, keep things unlisted
04After what happened yesterday...
04I uh
Irish_Pony: I miss you eery second until you come back <3
dirtnap
/me drops da base
YAY DROPPING THINGS.
i only seen "light" beer in the US.
/me nuzzles Airpuff
04I don't feel so comfortable with pastebins anymore
*bass
Well...
Magical_pablez94: I see. Get's me thinking. Good thing he doesn't know what the first episode is all about. But I'm pretty sure as soon as he see's ponies he's gonna run off. I think I might need some tape. :3
MahBoi777: I guess :P
... WHAT!?
somepony made an error
just watched teens react to prom... LEGASP
the US is a funny place
13that was a case of failing to notice the privacy setting
04Yeah
/me nuzzles CCCP
Gravity makes objects fall the same!?
Hugs CCCP back :)
Tory understands
we are all humans
13which is why i say make or link accounts
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: IKR
even they're ashamed they're wasting beer
DO NOT DROP THAT BEER!
04But I still am incredibly wary of pastebins now ><
pikorar: Serious science.
/me huggles alexxm :3
and he learned from it
lol Kari
pikorar it does
WASTE!!
:'(
Fun fact... This is a stupid myth bust because all object drop at the same rate...
why do they even test this?
04That's another thing though, Shizuka
04You're trading forums for pastebins
11,01Did someone outside of our group find something?
/me hugs CCCP
of course its a stupid myth
well duh
04One medium of communication for another
:D!!!!!!
pikorar: Nope. Air resistance on Earth.
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
04What's the difference
But we already no this...
..........
Invi for shits and giggles
04How would pastebins work better?
:'( waste of beer is cruel
13pastebins can be brought up from the person they are relevant to
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I wouldve bet he was a closet brony during the teens react to bronies video
Poor beer :'(
YOU COULD GET DRUNK WITH THIS!
who was having trouble convincing their friend to join the herd?
pikorar: Okay, my argument is gone. :D
Y u watse cider :(
YAY DANGER OF GETTING HIT WITH GLASS SHARDS.
13and only when they are relevant
really?
04Can't forums work the same
/me hugs Ponies47 "This is madness"
GilDash: that just means they have a different terminal velocity, but they accelerate at the same rate
wow
13clearly they aren't
lol why?
04Especially if we were doing individual dept. sections
Alchemist: So given a long enough distance...
:O
04And you think pastebins will?
and why is that?
Hah, GilDash. Finally something that I took from science class that I actually remember acurately.
04Let's face it
the bass?
13believe me i'm all for actually using the forums, but the point is we. are. not.
04It's all about convenience
potty
/me bursts into flames
yea dropping stuff
TOILEETS
04What would make people do pastebins
Gildash: one will hit the ground faster. Yes.
pikorar: What's the number?
dropping toilets from cranes. FOR SCIENCE
why are the forums not being used?
DROP THE BASS!
04Where's the motivation
they should drop a bass guitar
/me grabs Invi and Airpuff
13we're already doing google docs for a number of things
drop dat bas
i have farted
Pajaro those are really expensive
The only class I can remember accurately is sex-ed.
04We could try for google docs
I'm dissapointed in the sound that the piano made when it feel... On cartoons it makes a fun piano-sound, but there it made no awesome sounds
13pastebin grants nicer urls that we're more likely to look at
Hugs Airpuff 'Madness' This is NOT sparta! It's a waste of beer. :'(
so
04That does seem to get more attention
05i could try to use the forums more sure, but it would be more convenient for me if it was under bronystates roof rather than effing zetaboard
alexxm: heheh fart
GilDash, what do you mean?
PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON!
Sexy...
flat
6_9
/me grans Alicorn_Prince_Shane nuzzles him and slaps alexxm with him
that is kinda disturbing
Oh my gaaaaah
*grabs
sexy Tory
it's just a link Wrek?
he sponged that like a pro
pikorar: G. What is the number?
sorry Invi
Put the bra back on!
question for the techs
poot
the forums are just meant for the staff
Ponies47: if he acts like that.. solution is one only: thalk with him about why u think MLP is that awesome. u dunno? just think harder something will get on ur mind. then say him to watch at least this one more..( the 1st one) then say if he likes it or not. obviously u have to show him 1st and 2nd part of it :D
04Though we talked about that one other day, finally making forums public and more convenient
lol why u slapping alexxm invi?
13Luna: for me, there's no new information there that can't be brought up in SRS to get fresh opinions
wait they had to break a crap load of stuff to prove ma=mg, a=g?
Is it possible to make an invisible forum?
04What would be the point if nobody used them
or hell, how about this:
wha
thank goodness
Alicorn_Prince_Shane he farted in the chat
10Why do I keep DCing
lol
i farted Alicorn_Prince_Shane
. . . dang it
twilight_sprinkle: Yes. =_(\
Effing brilliant!
13at this time, hosting our own forums is a matter of cost and administration
lol Invi
can we make a tab on the main page that is only visible for us when we're logged in
yes but Shizu dear you do agree with the amount of offtopic chat / non serious chat in SRS?
YAY FARTING.
YEAH Flatulence
ATTACK Invi ATTACK
and that tab just links to our zetaboards?
Kinky...
ponies are kewl
that's disgusting
GilDash: I still don't follow... I must have missed something... G as in G forces? What?
GilDash: this show is so stupid imo..
13yes there's a lot of offtopic, which naturally arises from realtime chatting
13breaking a train of thought to take it to G is difficult
04Which is why I agree with no more finalized business in Skype
Um... Girls are humans, right? They pass gas, myth busted.
Magical_pablez94: Anthor problem he doesn't like talking. TO BAD! :[
YES. GIRLS PASS GAS. MY MOTHER DOES IT EVERY FUCKING TIME.
1,11Why not just put a link to the Zetaboards in the topic of our Skype groups/
13we're slowly getting better at it, but that's how it is
pikorar: G as in G. =_(\
pikorar: no, g as in gravitational constant

Ponytail LYRA
1,11?*
0,14you gotta take the good with the bad in terms of Skype
topic links haven't been working
Oh. I have no idea. I never learned that.
twilight_sprinkle They felt like it. They already knew what would happen.
13that's a different problem
03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/homework-class-test-you-will-never-use-this-again.png
13topic links are worthless in skype
pikorar: You know. 9.81...? =_(\
parachute panties
TL's haven't been using the projects google doc
13i'll show you why
I'm liking these ponies with ponytails
0,5I have the forums in my bookmarks tab
oh god ponytail Lyra is adorable
GilDash, I'm taking Physics this next year...
love that Bon Bon cap ^_^
pyrocatboy: its a waste of money
No GilDash, I don't know...
13is there a link in the leads topic now?
Dken2021_: Lol
Science!
Oh my Gaaaah
We are still doing SCIENCE?
Im back
CrimsonPhoenix: So much tail 6_9
d'aww CrimsonPhoenix
pikorar: g = 9.81 would be a good thing to bring with you. =_(\
not anymore I think
^
0,5Skype topic links are pretty useless
/me throws science at a wall
facehoof
Ponies47: close him in ur room and tie him to a chair. take a SPAS-12 and aim to his head and start saying that if he wants to survive to u he must watch it.
0,5I will admi
Well I have yet to learn it, GilDash!
0,5*admit
MahBoi777: it sticks!
dat ass
05i jsut feel its handier to have everything on the same place. maybe thats why eqd is so popular, it has everythign on the same place
04What about making the forums public
/me uses Invi-powers to enter lurkmode
pikorar: Now you know. :|
twilight_sprinkle: Huzzah!
13i'll use SRS as an example since the banlist is there
It's as flat as her chest.
04That way we'd ALL have a reason to go to the forums more often
O_(\
05,15It's still there, just all the way at the end, and I have my skype window small so I don't see it
twilight_sprinkle Who cares? Its for SCIENCE!!!!
11,01Part of the reason is because some of those topic links get cut off.
/me pokes GilDash
pikorar: You've learned more complicated math than me, but I know more physics? That's starnge...
CrimsonPhoenix, is she gonna do Derpy too?
9.81... Okay. I'll put that on my list of numbers and call it later.
pyrocatboy: this show is pseudoscience
BUTTCHEEKPEEP
At some point possibly
I guess Acleps.

Magical_pablez94: I don't have a gun. I'll just tape him to my chair. I'll make him sit in my chair and then quickly tape him to it. :P
i respect her more for this
Adam is getting off on this, isn't he?
EqD is popular because it was the first fanbased site
that's all
pyrocatboy: they make too many compromises to prove stuff anyway
pfffffft
XD
pikorar: interesting...
Adams tirade forced her fart
13http://tinypic.com/r/2uti8h3/6
:D
11,01I use URL shorteners.
04Let's stay off EqD
13there is a link in the SRS topic
Since when was there a female that enjoys working in engineering
13i do not see it
13ever
hehe Ty :3
10mfw GilDash tries to out-physics people by quoting G as 9.81, when we all know G=~6.674E-11N(m/kg)^2
toot
pikorar: SD? I haven't had to use that in *years*.

yeah, I would prefer to stay away from skype topics
RainBroDash: What? :S
13if we're going to need immediately usable links, then there's one place to put them
10My connection is fine
RainBroDash no that is g not G as far as i know
dey bleuw eet up reel gud
GilDash... Now you know where I'm coming from with science.
She had a microphone.. in her ass? o.o

10Blame Xanbreon
but going back to the question I asked before
KA-BOOOOOOOOOM! :D

Airpuff: I was thinking that too :S

twilight_sprinkle First they test the myth with all exact details of the myth. Then, when it fails, they try to replicate the results of the myth.
i might enjoysome korra but hell it's avatar.
GilDash: other G
Ponies47: no seriously talking just take that headset off from his head. turn off his computer the TV the xbox/ps3/every fucking stuff dat may distract him and start talking him seriously. he will listen to u. i'm sure he will. remember: never make he live this like a MUST. it have to be an his won choise to watch it. brony brother or non brony brother:D
04I say either we work to make the forums public, therein meaning that we'd all have a reason to be there every day or we come up with some other idea
/me grabs Invi and Airpuff " look avatards on"
MahBoi777: I just find the Avatars voice ANNOYING
10local gravitational field acceleration ('little' g) at the average surface of the earth=g=9.81. 'big' G is the Universal Gravitational Constant, as used in the law of universal gravitation and general relativity Invi + GilDash
GilDash: capital G is gravitational constant
What's up with all the text walls today?
/me giggles at Alicorn_Prince_Shane I
Oh Mah Shoe
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytRm_p03xSQ
GilDash: small g is for earth
The last time I learned anything about gravity was 7th grade, during my middle school physics class, since then I've had biology, chemistry, and 2 earth sciences.
Sumica, I finally got the whole series on my computer! It's awesome
I've seen it already!
RainBroDash: Okay, so I forgot how to capitilise. :D
RainBroDash: dat science wall
05sicne we want to have a public forum anyways
yay
/me 10is being pernickety about capital letters and you can't stop him
13honestly i think part of the onus falls on admins here, in that they are present in all groups and could easily compile a pastebin of important business from time to time
It's a long long way to Ba Sing Se.
08,01i've just been reading the backlog, and can i reiterate my point from earlier: forums are a *terrible* way of storing info. to store info, an ideal solution would be to make a wiki.
Pollution!
oh bumi
my eyes hurt :(
Ponies47: his_own*
*Persnickety.
pikorar: What's earth science? :O
dat sewer
13critical problem with a wiki, training in formatting
dat poo
RainBroDash: no youre right, we were wrong. we misquoted, and i feel ashamed.
if you could work this wiki idea a bit out
But the girls in the city, they look so Prettaaaaaaaay!
RainBroDash: Also, I did refer to it later as little g as my brain kicked into gear.
sewer sneaking
lol sokka
Ello Olly
/me wonders what persnickety means
/me heals CCCP eyes with magic
RainBroDash ok, then i swaped g and G accidently ^^
i'm interested in talking about it
howadoin
sokka gets covered in shit
Magical_pablez94: Yeah he's gonna kill kill me if I do that. :$
that right there is the story of my life
Magical_pablez94: yay! :3
lol sokka
cachi01: Fussy. Padantic.
04I'm not keen on a wiki, honestly...
05hmm
hello everypony
why does sokka get no respect
O_O
Acleps: Learning about the eco-system, the atmosphere, tectonics, etc.
we need something
08,01Shizuka: using something like dekiwiki or mediawiki, it can be done wysiwyg-ly
lol
A MONSTER
xD
Noms on Muffin0
one way or the other
easy for you katara, you're a water bender
GilDash: what does fussy and padantic mean xd
CCCP: *hugs you*feelin' better? :)
pentapus
05i'd like to see how it would work before i give a definite answer, but im happy to try out
pikorar: Oh... We have that in biology :)
08,01it'd be just as easy as posting on the wordpress
hey Muffin0 hows your day been
alexxm Because he Sokka
Magical_pablez94: yesh :)
awwww
baf
so mcute
how does he know what they are
Cutest things evar! :)
:3 so cute
Oh shit
they're sucking my face!
*bad
cachi01: Go and find a dictionery.
GilDash: whats a dictionary? :D
Ponies47: it's just an example... pretend to talk to him seriously, like if he was an adult. and he will listen to u.
GilDash: dictionary XD
lol
RUN BOI
08,01if you'd like to see how a wiki works for internal organisation on a real project, i can give you all a temporary read-only access account to the BUCK wiki
lol
that acting
04But wouldn't the wiki be public
13thing is, wordpress is using markdown, cause it's the easiest markup format that won't wipe out the tag overrides i needed on our pages
08,01Ghosties: no
GilDash: What is that magic? 6_9
cachi01: Sweetie Bell or Applebloom.
give him the oscar already!
13i think there are three people on staff that know markdown..
So many zombie references
dat sewar friend
alexxm: bad
04And yeah
evil hags
Gamer_Luna: Are you trying to muder me? Because thats way to adorable....
04You'd have to train everybody to use the wiki
GilDash: oooh that! thx :D
how come Muffin0
04So
dose rymes
05in fact this is out of my knowledgebase, ill stay quiet.
04That's something ELSE people would have to do
13i tried training for markdown
04It's all about convenience
13no one listened
my dog had a stoke and cant stand
11,02I personally don't see what's wrong with using the forums to share information. Although it's not used right now as often, if the topics are posted with a good name and posts added that give useful info are edited into the first post, it should all be fine.
azula has friends?
GilDash: lookslike i only have spanish dictionaries and my english dictionary is at school :l
11,01Train me for markdown.
08,01like having a wysiwyg editor, as i said
Muffin0 :(
more like... slaves
Luna, how are you.
Shoot!! When did this start!?!
aren't they more of aquantences?
/me hugs Muffin0 sorry to hear about that
K, not watching this, don't want to spoil myself second season :D
I didnt refresh D:
Irish_Pony: Oh you "Kisses cheek"
04I'm for the forum in all honesty
that bumi
pikorar: I prefer pentacles.
pikorar: thanks, now I kno
Gamer_Luna: is that cute but...hem...needs to be depixeled a bit?
Isn't the earth partly metal?
04We already have it, we already use it (albeit barely)
nah, more like people who have debts to pay to azula
emo girl is emo
Muffin0: oh im so sorry dude :(
Gamer_Luna: <3 *kisses back*
You cannot fathom the amount of fucks I do not give right now!
not friends
13i'd support a wiki but i see it getting as little use as the forums
08,01a forum is a really bad way of storing information, because when you want to look something up, you need to think temporaly
04Why do all the extra work to make a wiki
im still hoping she gets better but it dosnt look like it
Aw baby!
Magical_pablez94: Hmmm. Yeah he's 16. He's gotta start putting down the video games. He spends HOURS playing video games. I have this one plan to pony up his computer. Good thing I'm outta school already. He's not :)
>Pinkie's first word is "surprise".
RaveBrony: it just started don worry lol
You are bleak woman! xD
pikorar: Yes, yes I can. I worked in customer service for a year. :D
08,01it's horrible from a usability standpoint
until now
04Why do all the extra work to make a wiki
forum use dropped when the ban list went to the google doc
That...blew my mind in way too many ways
Hey look! It's Marvin's girlfriend!
MahBoi777: Asin, the start of the stream?
bleak woman is bleak
11,01That
08,01Ghosties: making a wiki would take like 30 minutes of set up max, and maybe a day of info population
did he take down that boulder with a wooden stick?
RaveBrony: no the start of Avatar
chat derped?
GilDash, is it true customer service people put people on hold just for fun?
no, with air
04You'd have to get people to train
1,11I use googledocs for schoolwork all the time.
http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e100/wanderingwhimsy/PONY/QUOPONY.jpg damnit who is that pony, no tennis player i know has facial hair like that
no CCCP
Well, that game of L4D2 was...interesting.
/me hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane .. "She is scaring me.." :'(
Ponies47: hey if someone is playing videogames let him play videogames!!! or else ur gamer anger system will activate and bad stuff happens
MahBoi777: Oh, ok. Yay! :) ty :3
13Ghosties: then the onus needs to be on you and the admins to keep up on the training
alexxm: i know now
08,01Ghosties: but there'd be no training! i just said twice it can use a wysiwyg system!
pikorar: No. We do it because we don't have authorisation, or because some of us are just really thick.
05never used a wiki in that manner before, sounds interesting
RaveBrony: no problem:)
*sigh* nothing ever happens.
Magical_pablez94: Yeah,I can't draw crap on MS paint :$
Well GilDash, I will be your customer. Now service me.
dat music
RaveBrony: /)
uh oh, aangs in trouble
08,01oh
that tai lee
08,01okay, maybe i should explain that
Iron_Edge: (\
Sumica: is this live too?
00,10and wtf is wysiwyg?
what you see is what you get
11,01What You See Is What You Get.
Ponies47: REMEMBER : DON'T GIVE THIS LIKE A MUST TO HIM. IT HAVE TO BE AN HIS OWN CHOICE!
08,01wysiwyg = what you see is what you get
freak!
pikorar: How may I help with your enquirey today?
cuck norris can do that with his hair!
Is this Twilight Sparkle?
yay
04...that sounds incredibly vague
08,01so you don't type tags or markdown, you click buttons
/me feels geekish :3
GilDash, yes I have a sexy problem I need to get worked out.
08,01like a word processor
All of the flexibility O_o
cachi01; Problem is he spends WAY to much time playing video games. He has never dated a girl and he's 16. I'm 14 and I've already danced with a girl :)
Gamer_Luna: btw is not that bad! at least i understood it was Irish_Pony :D
FUN FACT: the mods enjoy being called Sexy.
fuddy duddy = funny?
0,14seems like something super simple
I wanna date that girl! She is so ... jumpy! :)
08,01it shows you the format as you type
pinkie pie
13it is
and then. . .
08,01yup
0,14just type and go?
Pinker Pie.
pinker
Twilight what are you doing in Avatar?
08,01yup
oh look avatar
11,01Yep.
Magical_pablez94: So true :)
...
pikorar: GilDash isnt a Nurse silly
04So then we just say SO LONG! to forums
0,14works for me
04yeah
We have a WYSIWYG system at the Wiki at work. Nobody knows how to format the Wiki, but aside from advanced things, it's brainless to use.
04okay
Magical_pablez94: of course... :$
wordpress is WYSIWG right?
13wordpress is using markdown
tai lee = impersonation of pinkie pie
ahh
Airpuff: x that girl
13which is close to WYSIWYG
Ponies47: let him lol actually 16 is a very early age to start having a serious relation
Gamer_Luna: of course i had to...he shown his own OC something like 20000000000000 times... :D
well it's simple to use
pikorar: he?
/me blushes Thanks Alicorn_Prince_Shane :)
08,01okay, if admins/TLs want to see how we use the wiki for BUCK, pm me later
pikorar: Can you tell me the nature of your problem, sir?
FlareChaser: you like your OC? ^^
/me boops Airpuff " np"
/me hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane
13normally wordpress would be WYSIWYG but that was incompatible with the style overrides necessary to make half the site work
O_O
Nothing, you jelly?
dang it bumi
Bumi consulted the magic conch
And then he did nothing. The end.
soo... King Sumi os like France?
08,01aye
Ponies47: plus i spend all day playing videogames and i already dance with a girl also lol
VioletGreySha: love iy! <3
08,01this'd be completely separate, thoguh
Dken2021_ you'll understand
/me sits on the ground showing no expression
/me waves Ima be right back! Cya later Gais :P
WHOA
00,10kinda sorta not realy
bye Airpuff
I would prefer using the forums, they are already up and running.. maybe some finetuning left and right
/me hugs alexxm
Bai alexxm :$
bai Airpuff
00,10he gave up so his people could be free
but we do not have re-invent the wheel
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i made flares OC xD
bye Airpuff
Sumica: whos your favorite avatar character?
11,02Honestly, it sounds like a lot of effort ditching one system in favor of another.
Airpuff: See ya. ;)
there are more pressing matters
omg cool VioletGreySha
/me is lost in all the technobabble
Yeah cya all a bit later
GilDash: Yes, one of my wires seem to not be working, I think it needs some stimulation.
^^
:3
Sumica: You're sexy.
cachi01: True. He's so negative he say's he's never gonna have a girlfriend. I think he got mad when he found out I danced with a girl and she was really CUTE to. :$
Airpuff: Happy tuseday
ewwwww
08,01Luna: i disagree. a forum is a fundamentally unsuitable system for information storage and retrieval.
it's a plaque!
I just don't see how switching the medium will change people's willingness to use it
yay!
Airpuff i'm not leaving i thought you were
00,10Iroh and toph
put one of thoe=se things on your dick
STRUT
Dat old man.
/me wonder why this show didn't catch on in Japan.
04Forums would be better
And then they all died because penta pox is a real thing. The end.
04We're wasting resources on a wiki
hes good
pikorar: Okay sir. Have you tried restarting your system first?
because now instead of not checking the forums, people just wont check the wiki
xD
04Wasting training on a wiki
Sumica: very good choices
13but ghosties
04Just use the forums
13with a forum
04Why is that so difficult
Yes I did GilDash.
08,01Ghosties: resources? you mean the tech team working for a day getting it going?
13you have to think "when was X talked about"

Ponies47: seriously: i have a whiole summer vacation to make he change his mind. don't waste it with musts. they never work. didn't with me won't won't him. i know the kind of kid. almost as me. 2 years ago..
L4D time
13you're thinking in the wrong direction
ZOMBIES!
zombies?
dey drunk
ZOMBIES
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo
thanks for the games guys
zombies
08,01exactly ^
THE PLAGUE, RUN AWAY RUN AWAY!
Ponies47: lol ooh so he is negative then uhmmm well just uhhmmm damn i dont know how to solve negativism lol
04We already have a system in place, why waste resources and time and training on something like a wiki
ZOMBIES OMGMOMOGMOMGOMGOMGOGMGOGM
Rombies
13if i think "i want to know about X" i first have to know when X was discussed
imagine if they started killing them
o_o
ZOMBie tiem
they be in truoble
ITS MIAMI!!!!!
xD
overkill XD
pikorar: I need you to go into your control pannel and tell me what ports you are having problems with, sir.
PLAGUE
ding ding ding
I like the amount of zombie comments :D
cachi01: Agreed :)
08,01Ghosties: there would be minimal training, and i'm not sure what "resources" you're talking about other than me and shizu's time
Erryday ahm pentapox.
no touchie
04It would be about as used as the forums
/me has pentapox
Starting a realtionship just for the sake of having a relationship is the worst thing one could do.
04We already have a system in place
little babby
11,02When the forums gets used to its full potential and actually checked regularly, then I'll be in favor of hearing how much better Wiki is than the forums. Right now, the forums aren't regularly posted on and checked. I'm almost certain a lot of our problems will solve themselves if people just use the forums on a daily basis.
04You're trading one thing for another
Magical_pablez94: Okie doki loki :)

Ponies47: promise me u won't.

FLOPPSIE
Gamer_Luna: Holla! :)
Ponies47: u know which kind of promise :D
08,01so how about killing two birds with one stone and setting up the wiki *and* making sure we use it more?
YIPYIP
04How about
Bronysith: Lol

04YOU USE THE FORUMS MORE OFTEN
/me sickly moans because pentapox
FOOD
04...sorry
04But seriously
Gamer_Luna: i saw your jacki chan pic, its very nice :)
GilDash,what would you like me to draw? :)
08,01because forums suck
04Why do you want to switch out one thing for a system we already have in place
04Now that's just base
PARKOUR!

BABBY ADVENTURE 2
13we didn't need to go to wordpress
08,01it is, but it's basically the point i'm trying to get across
13we did
moin VioletGreySha :3
/me ruffles Ponies47's mane "that's exactly what i hoped to hear!"
:3
04We had decided on wordpress from the beginning, Shizuka
twilight_sprinkle: Thank you :)
alexxm: its anime what do u expect
08,01moving to a better system is better for everyone in the long run
pikorar: Can you tell me what your order number was, sir?
That fart noise.
VioletGreySha how is it going? ^^
04When we were in talks about 2.0 we wanted to do wordpress from before the new year
/me nuzzles Magical_pablez94
Magical_pablez94: Now I gotta go brush my mane agian :( IT'S ALRIGHT! :)
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
Yes GilDash, I think it was 0000069.
13but why spend effort on doing it when you could have stuck with the old site
04Yes
Bronysith anyone can die
inb4 death.
04Why spend effort on something that we don't need
alexxm: not the babies lol
pikorar: Okay... You ordered this from us 3 months ago, is that right?
04When we already have something that we can use
Invi: good good my mother sits behind me while i skype and drink energy drinks xD
13you're missing the point
the old site.. needed a new face / better backend structure
personally, I'd have to agree that forums are a horrible way to retrieve information
Set the net on fire.
Yes GilDash.
god azula
04I just don't understand
FIRE makes everything better
Invi: and you? :3
13why did we go to 2.0 rather than stick with the old site
/me ruffles alexxm 's mane too. ":)"
BRILLIANT
Azula is such a tool.
13because the new was a better more effective way
Gamer_Luna: I'd ask you to draw my OC, but I have no idea what she looks like. :D
08,01honestly ghosties, i'm not getting your argument here. shizu and i would set this up, we would use it, end of. no using up some finite resource, no work done really by anyone else other than us, and pretty much no training if we do it right
Hi everyone
Such a sadist
03http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-keep-your-head-down2.jpg
release the hounds
04That's what you're saying in theory
allo ShiningArmor
Release the everything!
lol elephant
They're living in the olden ages... I had no idea they even regarded personal safety.
That's one awesome circus
elephantbear
hi ShiningArmor
hey ShiningArmor hows your day been
Meanwhile: the contrary actually, she was manipulating the girl into joining her
04The wiki doesn't seem to be the be all end all to our communication troubles
/me noms Ponies47's mane
BRB I gotta go brush my mane
13is 2.0 better than 1.0?
GilDash: I'll draw anything pony-related :)
hi ShiningArmor
Gamer_Luna: your OC is next on my list just for soem information ^^
OMG BABY
08,01it's better to use the right tools for the job than to use bad tools "just because they're there"
Boomy is the name of my mine turtle... *Explosion*
twilight_sprinkle: What a story Mark.
VioletGreySha I am just watching the stream ^^ my parents already sleep since 3 hours....
13^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
BABBY ADVENTURE 2
04Look at what I said, it does not seem to fix our communication trouble
dang it
OMASHU
Meanwhile: tell that to the writers
13we're tech, we know what we're doing
04It's not that
VioletGreySha: Yay! :)
Yes, because kidnapping is always a clever plot.
Invi: ^^
10http://bulk.destructoid.com/ul/23241-Kyubey.jpg
okay, how about this
twilight_sprinkle: I would but they, like me, don't really care.
08,01yeah, i agree ghostie
04You think it's better from a technical viewpoint
going back to what super said
pikorar: Right, well... We can arrange for a new shipment to be sent to you for next Tuesday. We will collect the old products from you at this time too, so please be prepared to return them to us.
the question should be "why aren't people using the forum", for me, it's because 1) nobody else is; and 2) forums are a pain to search through information
04But think about a communication perception
let's focus FOR NOW, on the not using it issue
they didn't even watch their son
08,01but what i'm saying is that while we're at it, we introduce this system so that it's easier to use for everyone
:O
pikorar: dat plot
once people start getting that act together
Azula did all that stuff so she could have that girl join her team
and USING the forums
lol wut?
let's open up the wiki discussion again
ShiningArmor: eeyup
Gamer_Luna: you know when I first met you, i thought you were an angel, but then I realized you were not an angel, you are a goddess...<3
stick
ye ShiningArmor
Yes GilDash, thank-you.
1,11I think Ghosties issue is that how will this work when we have more and more information to add and spread to the mod group?
04Work on a wiki, which means expending more work on a system that won't be used just like forums after six months
/me wacks sakka
Gamer_Luna: How about you draw my OC and you together. You have free reign as I've no idea what she looks like. :)
but for now, let's resolve the BIG issue
o hai ShiningArmor long time no see
give him your weapon, sokka
yeah, let him play with a weapon
hi ShiningArmor ! how 're ya? any good news?
EVIL BABEH
yes let the toddler play with the sword
YOU SO CUUTE
04None of you are seeing the big point
/me 11,01sees that this is going nowhere
04Explain to me
Hitler was a baby once.
omg birdy
It does.
pikorar: Is there anything else I can help you with today, sir?
But he always had the mustache.
oh wo wo cewt

03:ED
04And
03*:D
04We already have a system in place
0,14low risk/high potential reward works for me
04It's already active
i thought he came right out of hell as an adult
GilDash: No sir, just put me on hold for the rest of the day. I like the music.
nah, hitler was born with a moustache and his uniform
04Saxy
Irish_Pony: that's saccharine...
04You would be for BronyNation then
ShiningArmor: ikr
11,02I'm all in favor of making the forums more active for now and then if it continues to be a problem, we'll consider going to the Wiki option.
08,01Ghosties: wiht all due respect, i'm not sure how much you can comment on the "work" that needs to be done setting it up, when me and shizu know exactly how much work will be expended on this, and have taken that into account
twilight_sprinkle: and teh heil salute
:P
NEIN
YAY
don't jinx it
TRAP!
DEATH!
Irish_Pony: You are the sweetest guy ever.I love you,my shining armor <3
Bronysith: ye lul
Fegelein!
@Saxy what do you think about all the items that need to be copied over?
Hitler ALMOST became an Artitst... and ALMOST an architect... but the unversitys refuses... i would have reatced the same way
bad joke?
huuuugs
baby hitler always hated juice.
emo girl is sooo emo
0,14copy + paste?
hey, Babies arn't evil, it is what they experience that defines their future actions
04But it just feels like you're swithcing out one gamble for another
lol
Sure, go to the fire nation to die.
LOL i thought she said Kill me in
GilDash: So,I can make you an OC free hand?
goodluck with that
pikorar: I'm afraid we don't have a switchboard, sir. I cannot put you on hold.
"I have a good feeling about this."= everything will go wrong
tried that for the BS2.0 launch
you came to omashu at a difficult time, at noon!
Ryunosuke there is a difference between emo and depressed
08,01Ghosties: there are two separate issues here. one of usage, and one of tooling
Gamer_Luna: You've got free reign. Just keep in mind she's one hell of a flirt. ;)
05im willing to give the wiki a go
Hitler was angry as a little kid, when he learned that juice could not be burned, because he hated juice.
Omg shes like rarity
hen3ry he liked really concentraited jouce
only much more evil and bossy
GilDash: You don't say?
04No
04It's communication
08,01i'm not saying using a wiki will fix the usage, but it *will* fix the tooling
05and worst case ghosties can say "told you so"
New Ozai? Bad name :)
GilDash: I can work with that ;)
04Look at this from a team player position, not a tech one
Well then, GilDash, just sing to me.
08,01Ghosties: yes, and that encompasses both those problems
lol
team rocket
OMG i thought that was a pig o-o
hai bumi!
shits about to get srs
Gamer_Luna: Who needs armor when all I need is a steel heart that you create....<3
HI EVERYBODEHH
Hi doctor nick!
hey bumi
0,14also, that doesn't mean I support BronyNation, that's more like high risk/mid potential reward
hi Thorn
HAI Thorn
bumi got swwag
04You're talking about it from a technical viewpoint though, prove to me that a wiki would be better than a forum
hi Thorn
thornberry*
04Because I honestly see the wiki dying in less than half a year
:3
Well that's nice.
BYE BYE
04It'll end up just like the forums
hi Thorn
Dat king :D
bye ShiningArmor
bai Bumi
04Where we start and then stop
hey Thorn hows your day been
00,10I am confused. They are saying they will do the work yes?
Im not leaving
BUMI SWAG
that bumi
good.
13Ghosties: i want to know about trilogy events, i currently have to wade through a time-based forum to find a thread that might be relevant to it
pikorar: I'm sorry sir, but I have other customers to deal with. If there is nothing else I can help you with I really must be going.
08,01Ghosties: it's better because information remains canonical, from any source, without having to think temporally
04We have an idea and then it stops because we get bored and just go back to skype
i said bye bye because bumi left o-o
13compare
Aang says fuck yo shit.
been makin a homestuck rp.
13i want to know about trilogy events, it's there on the front page because it's a current thing
this is awesome!
i hope hes bending to fly up like that
Litwick: eeeyup
Irish_Pony: You have a way with words,my love. <3
lol bumi
Back. With my mane all brushed and neat :)
omg dat son of a bitch

Bumi is best king.
Ice Ice Baby
Gamer_Luna: <3

FINAL FUCKING LI
...to teh foot
WHITE CELESTIA
badass
FINALLY
Irish_Pony: I <3 you
Irish_Pony: i need ur OC image right now, ni jking please post it to me
04You're not going to change my opinion on this, the forum is just a much more convenient means because we already have it. If you want to do a wiki, fine, but I foresee it dying inevitably
0,14and given the fact that it's word processor easy, I don't think we need to worry about training
PWNED
pikorar: It's the pigments/flavourings...
04It'll wind up just like forums
04Dead
HAND TO THE FOOT
no*
04And because then we'll be back here
08,01Ghosties: that's a separate issue; the usage issue. as i said, what i'm talking about with the wiki won't fix that. but while we fix that by saysing "use this more", we also put in a more usable system
04Saying
But GilDash... It's not juice.
how does water trip one?
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
so the kid became part of the resitance
13how about this
Aang when azula jumped: O FUCK
04"Oh, wiki is dead, well, let's try something else"
13we make wiki
Gamer_Luna: I <3 you
pikorar: No. So the juice... has been destroyed. ;)
FINALLY A WHITE CELESTIA TOY
-------------------------------------------
08,01Ghosties: you're not getting the point
WEEEEEEEEEE
13we fill the wiki with stuff
wheeee
that wud be fun
13we point at the wiki and the forums
yay! :)
Cart surfing
13and ask "which one is more useful"
FTW
13THEN
13we decide which to keep
Cities with giant slides? I wish I could live there! :)
---------------------------------------------BAM--------------------------------------------
back on topic
pikorar: Furtheemore, whilst fire can't "burn" juice, it can destroy it. :)
Minecraft should be like this
08,01it's not about tryign a wiki to fix the usage problem, it's about using an appropriate tool and implementing a policy of usage
YES
04We were already on topic, Kirz -_-
CRASH INTO TEH CABAGE MAN
Well GilDash, that's all fine and dandy, but hitler was more of an "all at once" sort of guy.
05besides having a wiki will all the guides and ban lists and fuck all seems like a good idea anyways
why was the city bulit like this
MY CABBAGES!
alexxm: for transportation
JUICE CAN EVAPORATE ^_^
04It's about apathy and convenience
Hitler loved to concentrate his juice before he burned it. See what I did there?
Egad! she can duck
a white celestia toy that turns pink *hasbro trollface*
pwned
thanks Bronysith
13the forum ban list failed because you either had to get one person to update the first topic, or read everything to find something relevant
DOUBLE PWNED
TRIPLE PWN
04Convenience and communication
08,01yes, and using a wiki will fix the latter of those two, ghosties
hope i didn't misspell that
04That's what you say
o.o
chi blockage
ULTIMATE PWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
08,01the convenience, i mean
13you don't believe us?
APPA TO THE RESCUE
04You can do it, go ahead
PRESSURE POINT!
Is this lagging for anyone else?
Damn! :D
04I just don't think it'll work
yay came just in time for avatar
Dat tail.
04I just foresee it dying
pikorar: Amongst his greater failings.
Chi block Appa I dare you
pony_9996: not for me
kapow
EPIC! :O
04And then we'll be trying to find another excuse to use for failed communication
you know sokka is actully pretty badass
shet
FAIL
04Pardon my bitterness
all I care about is the using it issue getting resolved
FAIL! :O
Where's cabbage guy when you need him?
Like his hairstyle, GilDash.
as far as forums or wiki goes, I could care less

SHIIIIIIITTTTT
THE CRIMSON CHIIIIN!
manly chin
08,01Ghosties: as the organiser of a large event, large society commities, and of large software projects in the past, i can say with some amount of authority that a wiki will be a better solution than a forum
thanks Bronysith
Where is cabbage guy? This would be perfect right about now :'(
Like a Bumi
04Go ahead
pikorar: Where have I heard that before?
DAMMIT OLD GUY

04He started on BronyCon
REAL :| MAGIC!
lol
cachi01: yup
04copypasting
:o
041 Now, one thing I see as in issue at this current time is BronyCon. We were given passes to go to the convention, but I have not seen any word of what hotel or what times or basically any of that important stuff. In order to even get there, we have to know what time and how many nights we get to have the hotel. Additionally, since a few of our teammates are going to meetup at BronyCon,
4shouldn't we have at least a little something planned, like a stream of the event or a group local multiplayer gaming stream, etc? Please give more information and ideas.
CCCP I'm gonna embrace your face with a concrete block.

11,02We're about a month in advance of the event now, seems like a long time beforehand to really plan much. However, it couldn't hurt to at least setup the group.
Gamer_Luna: Have I told you how much I love your eyes? <3
04I know Scoot, Slurry, Super, Nitt, and myself

Dinner :o
Vordox: Lol!! :D
I wonder what's for dinner.
0,5Some people (few, but some) actually have wondered why I can't go. Main reason is my parents wont let a complete stranger (to them) drive me across the northeast.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: x that guy over there
His name is in blood red, like the blood of my enemies. How could you not see it?
Bronysith: x Princess_Molestia

pikorar: There was too much blood.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: how did you know i love her?
11,01And your parents don't know you're a brony, so they definitely won't drive you there.
0,5Can't go myself cause I don't have a car yet. Also, my mom doesn't know I'm a brony and she will obviously ask me where I'm headed.
interior crocodile alligator
1,11I can't go because I can't afford the travel, not to mention I have family commitments for the 4th of july that I think would get screwed because of it.

hey Dark92Enigma hows your day been
00,10this ep needs more banjos
SOME GIRL
pikorar: At least they don't have a redneck accent :P
IN A DRESS
Sumica: eeeeeeeeeeeeup
10http://newsbusters.org/blogs/lauren-thompson/2012/04/10/youtube-new-channels-cater-lefties <- Ew
GilDash i was just messing with you
Tea party?
:(
They kind of do, Acleps...
Sumica: it needs moar bacon
04Okay, let's move on to his next point
Gamer_Luna: nice
/me flee
Goddamn troll swamp.
00,10and pigs in overals
MY PLANET NEEDS ME!!!!!!!!~
MORE BANJOS! :D
Sumica: and blunderpusses
Cottencandy: Tea parties?
042 Next, I noticed we still have not done much concerning that "Downloads/Community Projects" section I proposed a few weeks ago. This would allow us to get more acquainted with other members of the fandom. We could review and backup any willing participants in this program. Some people and projects already in line for review and post are Flaria's cursors, MrEvergreen's pony game, and
4possibly some custom Desktop Ponies of our staff members' OCs created by a small group of people whom I have met: Flaria (known for making cursors) or Vordox (a spriter for 10 years, the creator of a current custom Desktop pony of one of our staff members, and the one who gave me the idea to create more Desktop ponies in the future) or one of herospirit's friends (works on making sprites of
4Pony Emblem, a crossover of Ponies and Fire Emblem). I'd like to see more thought put into something like this in the future.
1,11You all get some way to keep in touch with each other and plan the trip out. Take pictures, get a video or something, or stream if you want. That said, next point.
00,10trust in the heart of the swamp
Sumica: needs seapony lyra
Its Harold!
whoa. tree
Gamer_Luna: Thank you. <4
Gamer_Luna: <3
Its like the heart of the cards
Sumica: super special awesome swamp
Use the treephone
YAY
13a downloads page would be trivial to implement, but you would want enough content on it to make it look like it belongs
Acleps: Um... Then you should talk to my redneck friends.
the force
03and to keep "family" in their name
03for as long as the channel exists
GilDash: Welcome :)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH
GilDash i was just messing with you
Pajaro: what about the force?
alexxm good so far, thanks.......you heard about Orton, right? Word is that two more WWE superstars might have failed the wellnes policy
swamp thing!
My mother can use youtube now
13having just flaria's cursors would look a bit sparse, or worse
03I was a bit surprised to see some random religious speaker after watching Harry Potter
alexxm: I'll be messing with you... ;)
ded
TANKK
aaaaaannndd tentacle monster
She's a leftie :s
rape
it is within that tree
04I kinda like the idea of a downloads page
/me kisses Gamer_Luna.
as in, she is left handed
:D
Swamp thing is unhappy.
pikorar: What do you mean? Don't they have an accent?
who else Dark92Enigma
10Oh u
Cottencandy: Gamer luna? I'm a fan of her!
oh hey, a hentai monster
Gamer Luna nice pic
04But yeah, more material would be needed before implementation
05,15Yeah me too, but I agree that we'd need to have a lot more content to put into it
00,10damn katar is bad ass in this one
:P
13i've been thinking of reorganizing the nav menu so that paintchat isn't on the main bar, under a menu if anything
Evening everyone
The churches are holding TV for ransom these days
I've seen enough hentai...
13the menu is a bit of a navigational mess at the moment
it sounds interesting
PrincessLuna: hello how are you?
00,10first time we get to see her bend after training
evening PrincessLuna
katara became more awesome in the ep
Ohai PrincessLuna
Yes, they do, Acleps, and their accents are varying amounts of "southern".
Sweet.
Bronysith: damn gurl, you sexy.
run
/me steals alexxm 's leash "Giddy up GilDash !"
YEEEESSS I FOUND MY PHONE CHARGEEEEEEER
Evening PrincessLuna

11,01Johkapid (Wishdream) is supposed to create a desktop pony of me. I haven't heard back from him.
rape
03yeah :/
pikorar: I see... But then what makes them rednecks? The way they live?
03apparently it used to be owned by FOX
Hai Wrek?
13so the main point of contention is how much is under downloads
GilDash: Wipes away kiss.I didn't need that
alexxm Don't know....that's all i know at the moment
03And they sold it to Disney
alexxm: Busy, finally moved most of my stuff out of my apartment T_T
PrincessLuna: oh im fine. just excited about paolini writing the prequel to the inheritance cycle!
05pm
SEE YA LETER WALLY GATOR
03and apparently they have to air that stuff

PrincessLuna: Ello.
Bronysith: I know :D
Swamp Thing is best DC comic hero. suck it, Batman

PrincessLuna: i think he said its going to be about Brom
Petrified_Discord: 6_9
Bye byr Dark92Enigma :(
04Wait until more content before deploy
/me hugs Gamer_Luna.
*bye
0,14I guess, maybe pictures from artists could be featured as wallpaper?
1,11The current navigation isn't that bad. :/
Gamer_Luna: Of course you do. I wouldn't do anything less. :)
/me nibbles on Gamer_Luna's ear
02http://newsbusters.org/blogs/lauren-thompson/2012/04/10/youtube-new-channels-cater-lefties <-- lol how stupid
02who cares what hand it caters to
Bronysith: That would be awesome :) I think Brom definitely had an interesting lifestyle, especially with the fall of the riders
I know right
:p
Ponies I'm not going.....i made a Wally Gator reference
13it's disjointed, mostly on account of us having a wide variety of things that need to be one click away
pikorar: So what would you describe a redneck to be like?
Face plant. See what I did there?
02that's not ever new worthy
00,10hydro blade
02XD
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21423116
Irish_Pony: That tickles!
02even*
04Okay then
those ambidextrous people won't care
PrincessLuna: yea. i loved him and when you learned his secret in brisingr. hello!
:p
13rules and FAQ could be under about us, though they aren't because no one would read them then
lyra that is danerous get out of the water
02news*
*ahem*
Ponies47 I'm not going, i made a Wally Gator reference
04Moving on unless there's some other reason to continue on the downloads
13but anyway, downloads can happen, resolved that we need more to put there
FlareChaser nice
YA DON't SAY
10Politics, not hands
boom like a boss
naked man
FlareChaser: Please. Try Twilight or Fluttershy...
03LOL @ that former playboy model talking about her daughters losing their virginity
SO?
03don't ask why I watched that
:P
045 Also, I see we are needing to figure out our summer. This, my friends, is Summer 2.0. The summer that will outdo the previous one. A hard feet I know, but with enough planning we can do it. We'll need to prepare what exactly we should do for this summer. This summer will set the grounds for tradition in future summers. June, July, and August are our months. We need to plan for each day
Dark92Enigma: O. I walked away for a sec.
4within them. Games, movies, muzik, and whatever else we can dish out to make this summer the best one ever.
:D
1,11Desktop Ponies, artist wallpapers. Music selections. Flash game files.
Acleps: Well, they usually wear camo hats, generally have shaved heads, they're usually very bulky, or very tall and lanky...
wait wat?
Um...no. You just tried to kill us. :|
04So, sounds like he just wants more of an idea of what's going to happen for Summer
/me pokes Petrified_Discord
*Hugs Fluttercute* She's so cute :)
Huma huma huma huma huma huma huma
Just a regular guy that tried TO KILL US
13well since the one idea from my get-out-of-my-head brain dump, trilogy month, is going forward
FLUTTERSHY
Cottencandy: WHO VOTES FLUTTERSHY?! Anyone?
Enlightened old swamp guy.
PrincessLuna: Yeeeeeeeessss? :)
13the only other real idea i had there was more gaming events
And, Acleps, they usually drive a pick-up truck, go hunting and love mud balling.
13L4D2 went well i think
04Yeah...I'm kinda inclined to believe that...that's about it for now
04Unless, yeah, more gaming events
Petrified_Discord: I unno 6_9
PrincessLuna: Hello there. ;)
03http://www.theblaze.com/stories/red-bull-pulls-ad-depicting-jesus-using-his-own-name-in-vein-faking-biblical-walk-on-water/ <- LMAO
02what I find funny is the fact that most left handed people like me use their right hand on the computer
seems legit
whoa... TREE!
1,11TF2 streaming. I can join that one. It'd be fun as f*ck.
02XD
03do they?
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21423189 very punny.
02yep
WORLD TREE
Sumica: ty for all the desktop ponies!
GilDash: Ay :)
05TF2 i can join
03my grandpa is left handed and he puts the mouse on the left of his keyboard
03o.o
05i love tf2
GilDash: Seems i got away with it pretty unscathed :P
/me listens hard
11,01The My Little Investigations dev stream I want to do.
04But this point could take all day, so, maybe decide something now?
Hello, everypony!
only thing with game events, need more people for them, can't do another mod vs viewer l4d event
PrincessLuna: O hello your majesty *Bows down*
Gamer_Luna: I wub you <3
If you ever met a redneck, Acleps, then you would want to punch his/her mouth. They're annoying.
04Okay, TF2, MLI
Airpuff: You weren't the one who put it on...
Or this FLUTTERSHY ------->:(
deep
You can feel everything growing.
Hye hey hey sagas
hey sagas hows you rday been
pikorar: That's what I thought. Plus beer. Rednecks love beer. (at least that's what the tb has taught me)
Colonel Quarrich should blow that tree up.
allo sagas
04Oh
PrincessLuna: K :D
not enough mods for the number of games to cover everyone, gets tiring fast
04Uh
1,11And if we get the streamer to go Spectator mode on TF2, it'd make some good shots.
troll swamp
GilDash: But im the one who grabbed it and said "Giddy up" xD
Acleps: moonshine.
pikorar: TV*
The Fluttershy talked! :( yaaaaaaaaaay
Irish_Pony: I wub you too,honey. <3
13i discovered gaming department is building up a list of viewer's gaming accounts, and they're listing what games they have there
Petrified_Discord: Say wha?!
yep
pikorar: That's homemade alcohol right?
it has been linked too
04Kirz had been talking about possibly doing a BronyState Autumn banner
Cottencandy: Princess Luna?
11,01A member build up that list.
02Left handed people are better at using their right hand then right handed people are at trying to use their left hand
Matrix
Gamer_Luna: *kisses* <3
Time is an illusion, true facts.
13so given that could easily build up a list of multiplayer games that most people could join
04So that could be done this Summer
11,01I don't remember who.
Hey
I thought time was a social construct
PrincessLuna: Your the best princess! :)
queen luna!
The X's? haven't seen that show in awhile
alexxm: Tiring. Didnt get much sleep
11,01But I would love to have that list linked on our site.
I have no idea Acleps, but I hear rednecks talk about it all the time.
03also, way to generalize BlueFlare

Octavia <3
So, we're Steam buddies now. Cool. Thanks
Magical_pablez94 a male rainbow dash?
13again
or when E3 is up
13at the time, it was only the art contest
Magical_pablez94: No idea, I don't know him from the show D:
you know you are a brony when you can all these ponies there :3
13which had ended months prior
Magical_pablez94: Fluttershy obviously
Dken2021_: no way
1,11right.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aiu_L4b79DcrdGxyZmlmN0x5MjBxWi14ZkpNVFc5a0E#gid=0 I fixed it guys
11,01If you want what games to play, we discussed that during our last game dept meeting.
*can name
Magical_pablez94: Its Irish_Pony
Ponies47: say Sumica, yay. Sumi, WHOAH. Mica, OH MYYYY.
FlareChaser: :)!!!
so you didn't include it?
11,01I have it on a list.
13at the time no
13it has been three months since
I miss the science...
sagas: easy reading from title uh?
because it was agreed the artist's spotlight page was there to stay...
13if you want to yell at me for it, the window of relevance is long past
I should call the seaponies just so they would come here, and I'd get to see them suffer a slow painful death due to lack of water. THAT would be the best day of my life.
She blinded me with...science
PrincessLuna: ....the amount of princess's in this chat is too damn high!
13it can go back
Pinkies4thWall: Didn't know dat
stream?
13but would be better if there was more to put on it
FlareChaser: :(
FlareChaser: Nonsense
so we just add our gamer IDs to this thing?
I understand that
Acleps: And then we could watch Evil Dead. It would be amazing! :)
Acleps: :( But I like the sea ponies, they're the only pre-64 pony meme that's worth mentioning.
its not that damn high!!!!
Magical_pablez94: yep. I could tell though even without the title though
but I'm just not sure where the communication was
Did anybody see the Teens react to MLP?All the girls said no to a Brony boyfriend!I would love a brony boyfriend.
wat
oh. yeah it is
LOL
GilDash: Only if we watch Buried.
why the call was made without any discussion
FlareChaser, it's not high enough
ah buck it, gonna get pizza for my family
ok so I can't register myself?
Sorry, Acleps, I said 64, I mean G4, derp.
the amount of adorableness is NOT HIGH ENOUGH.
PrincessLuna: You're an amazing Princess. FlareChaser has no idea what he's taling about. :)
13because there were three days to take the site from a blank wordpress install to fully functional
11,02Moo ^-^

/me flails his arms in excitement
GilDash: Not for me. And that is the only fun I am concerned abouty
Cottencandy:Hello Princess Celesitia,Luna. Cupcakes Anyone?

What a story whoever you are.
1,11We're off topic.
OH MY
04Okay so
1,11Next point.
yes that's the main jizz of that controller
12Apparently I'm a 12-15 year old boy too
Cool!
My TV is a small screen
oh wow splitscreen
04Let's sum up the Summer Slurry thing real quick
LETS DRAW PONIES
The controllers are cool, but what are the features of the actual system?
Nittany_Discord: don
12fun times~
DAT LINK
drawing skills may vary
DAT LINK
11,01Don?
DAMN Pinkies4thWall
I am still not interested in all this damned motion control crap.
04Artist spotlight, game streams, MLI, favicon contest
04Okay
04Next
Nittany_Discord: 't know aquat about consoles, elaborate?
Booo Link
I share Yahtzee Croshaw's opinion of E3.
NINJA
Everypony type in who you love most in this chat! :)
I like to don pitahs
046 And here's this: team conduct. I have noticed a few people here misbehaving and acting rudely. Now, I know it's not as bad as some things, but it's something to note and really should be toned down. We don't need people ignoring our own rules and abusing power. It's unprofessional and is just plain wrong. Know what's right, get things done, and have fun.
Meanwhile: Which is?
Gamer_Luna: You <3
That's kinda cool..
sagas: don't get it sorry... may u explain a bit more simply.. im not that good at eng :d
THEY NEED TO WOK TOGETHA!
Looking at this I might have a future as an English language spokesperson..I'm German but I'd do better than him at least.. :/
EVERYPONY! I WUB EVERYPONY! :)
^^
GilDash: That it can piss off because it's pointless.
NINTENDO IS A GENIUS
DAT SENSOR
Gamer_Luna: That's a though one... ;)
Nittany_Discord: yeah, the enter key on my laptop is a sneaky bastard
11,01Dark_Horst: There are some bad rumors about the next gen Xbox and Playstation.
I don't like touch screens, have to friggin clean them everytime
Meanwhile: promotion time?
0,14Gyro sensors?
pikorar: By our powers combined!
http://www.mindistortion.tv/iwantyoursoul/?i_am=Derpyty
so six axis
Meanwhile: Fair point. :)
Cottencandy:As my friends say "I will not be a doormat"!
0,14it'll detect food?
Nittany_Discord: as far as I'm concerned, they ruined the Wii and 3DS with the whole "bricking the system for custom firmware" thing. If Wii U is clear of that, I'll be a fan of theirs again.
he talks so slowly.. :/
I have a feeling that the 2 screen system won't work for everone, end there will be a lot of problems with it...
Irish_Pony: You <3
and phone tech
Dat binoculars
ps4 is coming out end of next year
silly saxy
and always useless
1,11First of all, I want to say that there's a difference between abuse of power and playing around with each other.

Derpyty: u fucking soul stealer!
/me kisses Gamer_Luna <3
Hi everyone, is this E3 we are watching?
Magical_pablez94: What?
Nittany_Discord: i think the worst of all is that the next xbox wont read already used xbox games
duh fuq
00,10inb4 some one steps on controler and shatters screen
it's the pre-show CupcakeWarrior
13that's a razor thin line though
lolol i stole Magical soul
11,01Bricking the system?

Nittany_Discord: which i think its a fuckig stupid idea
Sumica: It's made from Nintendium though.

Gamer_Luna: Irish_Pony u 2 are fucking cute u know?
SuperBrony64 the double screen
not much that was shown last year SuperBrony64
you should have some hops or something so this kind of madness doesn't happen again
D:
Sumica bulllet proof is somthing software will never be
11,02CupcakeWarrior: yes
11,01Xbox wants to ban used games. So does the PS4. And then Sony has a patent for hardware that interrupts your games for ads.
1,11We're a site of fun, not stuck-up business bullshit. Unless it's a serious official stream, we don't have to put on as much of a serious act.
Magical_pablez94: eeyup <3
Magical_pablez94: A little too cute for me...
GIBBIT BACK
05something i have failed sadly
OMG SuperBrony64 YOU WALKED AWAY?

Why you no make a better console?
Magical_pablez94: G'night. :)
Dat feel when I will miss the Microsoft and Nintendo presentation
s
nunchuck...
NO
Cottencandy:*sees a book* Ugh! I hate reading!
I love the noonchuck controller
there will be a delay stupid lying spokesperson
13how about this
11,02woah
Irish_Pony: You have the cutest voice <3
GilDash: u're rough and we all know it :D
11,01And Sony wanted to do game registrations (which meant that you can't play your game on someone else's system).
Magical_pablez94: sleap like a rock
13if anyone comes to you with a complaint of power abuse
HORY SHEET
11,02xbox
CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP
asgjkladfghdsfghl'as
wow
df'gh
What was dat sandvich
Dat controller :D
well, that
0,14wow
13think very critically about how you've been presenting yourself and others
i know chopnese
Magical_pablez94: I can do cute too. Nopony seems to want it... :(
00,10looks like old sega
Om:thanks
s a real dickmove from sony
11,01I'd rather go Nintendo or nothing.
Magical_pablez94: You said you'de make my OC next time we meet. I said Ide hold you to it.
lol xbox controller
Nittany_Discord: So if I buy a PS4, the games will have ads in them?
0,14that looks pretty sweet
that's totally not a dualshock controller
dat wii u pro controller looks nices
1,11For example: I stopped kicking other mods during BMN nights because I know it's unprofessional, but if I show up, like Wednesday during a random Let's Play stream, I'll just play around with my mod abilities.
Gamer_Luna: You are the cutess thing <3
AKA xBox controller copyright infringer 2.0.
11,01CupcakeWarrior: Don't know.
Nittany_Discord: I'll use PC games only if they enable that. :|
me gusta
to go with that
Owao = overall :D
13see it from their perspective, because they may not be seeing it as someone having fun with others
no one should be afraid to make those complaints
so much Ikea
GilDash: i do, dear that's why i usually am kind with u. *cuddles*
So you'll need more than 2 hands if you want to have the new controller, and the old Wii controllers
Cottencandy: <:(
When does the Wii U come out?
My Wii is not in my living room... Whatchu talkin' 'bout!?
and then the wii collected dust for 3 years
yes, it meant loads of people spent money, used it for a few weeks then let it gather dust
Nittany_Discord: I can imagine it would make sense to have a console that would interrupt games for emerency announcements, such as evacuation orders for natural (or less than natural) disasters.
00,10and more tvs were broken that year the nany other year
13if i'm a viewer see a mod show up out of nowhere and start playing with power, that's unprofessional and lowers my opinion of the staff as a whole
xd
is every theatre streaming the same thing?
Irish_Pony: You are the most sweetest person I've ever met,sweetie <3
Distand locations aka. the bathroom
13we can be playful
04Have balance, boys and girls; be fun, but be serious when you need to be ;)
11,01Kandarihu: I actually would like that.
I'm not going to put any names and whatnot (though we all already know I'm talking about myself), but if you feel like someone is being rude to you, just tell them
Pajaro the theatres are just for the chatrooms
Wii U does what WE DID. Haha. :)
if there's a reason behind the fun kick and it's not just "hey, I can kick another mod, let's do that", then it's ok
Gamer_Luna and Irish_Pony: D'awwwwwww
ok. free samples for everypony.
Must... not...l look... at chatroom... some poeple are beeing stupid again...
Wii U does what (Wii/We) did. I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!
again: communication
so i can clop and play at the same time? NINTENDO I LOVE YOU
"INB4 i play wii u on the john
11,01A game interrupted by an NWS warning. I like that a lot.
in a bitter wa?
Who has a Wii in the reading room?
Nintendo has something that almost no other Console have, except very very few exceptions, Local Games.
1,11True, but really if it's not during an official stream, they can't expect us to act too official and professional.
no, please keep explaining
competting?
13but they do
Gamer_Luna: Then its true, the gods have blessed me with a angel....<3
11,01That's WHEN you want to interrupt a game.
THANK YOU!
04Yeah, they kinda do
sagas: what do you mean with "hold" i a yes or a nope?
The Wii U is single player only, right?
13it's the same channel on and off movie night
Nittany_Discord: We *all* know that'd be abused.
11,01Not to sell you something.

and if you have no friends?
what're they calling the multiplaer network? wakka lakka zoot zoot YOinK?
04Okay
04Well
From my country
I speak more than 1 language
04Um
And language?
CupcakeWarrior: FEPIC
COOL!
DAYUM
I prefer harumf
woah speech bubbles
04So the last of Slurry's topic is uh
GabeMoist: ^
ever since I lost wii sports, the mii channel is useless
/me laughs lightly
I SEE Gaming Scenes increasing options!
11,02Thanks Nintendo for kicking the crud out of the Xbox 360 and PS3 ^-^
Also, Wii U. Oh god. They'
I am so going to video call everyone
NINTENDO I LOVE U+
They're gonna highlight that all of E3.
SuperBrony64: Havenät they always...?
;_;
it's a gun
SuperBrony64 are you serious? you LIKE this?
Hey Curly <3
Cottencandy: * wings start falping *
I have absolutly no desire for this Wii U. They're gonna have to try harder than this
dammit im going to be forced to buy a crappy Xbox 720 just for halo
how can anyone like this
Chrysalis: Some people have no taste.
SB64: Only took them 8 years.
miis love guns
04Alright
hey ^^
I want a gun
how's you?
did he just say..
I'm okay :o
so yeah... it's a 3d interface for lobbies
i refuse to belive that people can be excited for this
05,15what did I miss? what does it do that's so amazing!?
Miiverse
I'm intrugued by this...
Console wars are amusing because they will always be inferior to the PC.
Mebers?
no shiiiit
Oh yay, I can watch the Sony presentation to see if the PS4 will be any good
the miivers
the Miiverse looks a lot like Nintendogs
woooaaaahhh
wooooah
Been busy starting up a company >.<
Dirty console playing peasants.
04Well, he said to skip Brony Funds
So, is the Wii U going to support HD?
Cottencandy: :(
/me is insanely bored now.
Yes.
fluttercry, Mii Wara Wara
you don't say :O
fluttercry: Awesominity...
Kandarihu: Yes
mind blown
I'm not impressed by this at all, and the controllers cannot be practical, they have to cost at least $70 a piece.
kandarihu: ya
Lies down next to Irish_Pony to watch this <3
Pc is still best
pikorar: I'd put the price much, much higher.
^
Kinda lost track of everything else
Gamer_Luna: Aww you...<3
05,15Mii...Wara....Wara?
Darkts3: That's not a console, silly
This looks like a waist of money
When is he gonna announce Nintendogs U?
also, Why is this announcement sounding more like a Training Video for people working at a Restaraunt?
04But it is an important thing to discuss since it's related to BronyState in a way...
Cottencandy: :'(
PC is both best and worse
fluttercry: it's basically the new iphone. ask SuperBrony64
Darkts3 +1 to that
Ohai fluttercry
Vordox: yes it is
11,01Yeah. That's his child.
11,02pikorar: You do realize an Xbox 360 controller is $60...right?
pikorar: Someone just said they would be 200$
Wii U supports 1080p and apparently the internet. So it's finally caught up to the last generation of consoles after only 8 years or so.
fluttercry: it means Mii rabble rabble
fluttercry: you just missed the worst commercial nerd ever :D
fluttercry: *wii wara wara
SuperBrony64: You do realise that the wii is for little girls...right?
CK|MoarDed: Ikr
hey fluttercry hows this day been
how about you?
04Yeah, but he intended for it to be with BronyState during BronyNation
DerpSurge: BEST Commercial GUYS ;)
let me fuck us?
04At least I believe
Congrats, Nintendo, you're only about a decade behind the curve.
CK|MoarDed: not true.. xbox 360 and ps3 run on 720p
2!pokemon
Ran, you are a 4Mew.
04I don't want to put words in his mouth
Teckest
2:<
RAWRity: Welcome to Nitendo Sports Bar. May I take your order?
SuperBrony64: Well then take that and put a screen on it. Maybe $150.
Darkts3: They have 1080p
04So then...do we discuss Brony Funds later when he's around?
if such a touch pad thingy dingie breaks, it will be very expensive
how the hell is a touchscreen simpler
slow tyoing is slow
than a damn keyboard
channel guide
The PS3 is for folks who didn't want a car, Xbox is for frat boys, and the wii is for middle aged women and small children.
sagas: yeah, I'd like a console that doesn't use SD cards for memory.
11,01Depends on if we can get everyone back together when he's around.
Fuck this is gonna be worse than the 3DS
13SuperBrony64: for that price, i could buy six games, lolconsoles
get glasses
I <3 This Gun
that'S probably becasue their tv sucks
=/
so many drawn dicks
>3
Darkts3: Assuming you're correct (and I don't think you are) then that makes it still a good 5-6 years behind. >_>
I <3 Gamer_Luna
so its a bamboo tablet in disguise?
11,02Shizuka: Why can't you let me have fun ;~;
/me hugs SuperBrony64
Dat Wrek ping timeout
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior back ;A;
YAY FLIPNOTE
RAWRity: Best I can do is a thumb drive memory
/me rallies to SuperBrony64's cause
Because dirty console playing peasants.
Crap, I missed Mother's Day
if i would write handwrite, nopony would understand me.... xD
dat flipnote
Nikki! :D
To Your Mom.
I don't want stronger feelings
I'M ON FLIPNOTE HATENA
miiverse keeps sounding like a bad word in my ears
I <3 Irish_Pony
dat pictochat
YOU CAN NOW DRAW PENISES ON YOUR FRIENDS' TVS! HOORAY!
oh wow, damn smileys
does this help me play games?
SuperBrony64: So many "non console" people understand the joy of consoles here. :( Cause they do not have the upbrining of the amazing eras of Console and the experience coming from it.
11,02SCREENSHOTS
13<3
*scrolls down, see dicks* uhhhh moving on

ZOMG WOOOOOOOOO OSCREENSHOT
Cottencandy: * flys* Who perfers a MLP episode then this video?
RAWRity i will make you proud
I take it Sumica doesn't like Nintendo.
04Motion to postpone Brony Funds until Slurry returns?

Sumica: We shall call them...emoticons! :O
Naked?
0,14OMG
0,14OMG
00,10sumica dont like bulshit
They're naked?
From a country whose schools still teach writing by hand to a country that types everything out on computers from kindergarden, I'll bet.
yea
how is this company still making money/
Naked.
Cottencandy_111: shut up dont ask for MLP
0,14I SEE A DOUBLE RAINBOW OUTSIDE MY WINDOW
buddon
13second
nekkid
Wii U is naked.
SaxyPretender: What does it mean? :O
this sounds like an absoulute piece of shit
ooo look a mario game how could anyone have guessed
Wii U: IT PRINTS MONEY!

11,01Yep.
O.o
SaxyPretender: QUICK TAKE A PICTURE
SaxyPretender: :O

SaxyPretender So intense?

00,10oh good my friends can see my failures
NO, GIVE SPOILERS.
No! Not spoilers!
spoiler alert
I SEE TROLLING moments here on WII U XD
xd
spoilers
Cottencandy: Fine! we stick with this dum video!*Flys off*
Sumica: that's half the fun
i like how he advertises stuff that has been used by gamers for years already as TOTALLY NEW AND VISIONARY!! one could think he'D be working for apple
Pffft, empathy
Em pah the?
As if you could possibly spoil anything Nintendo does, because they've done it all already.
04I agree as well...anyone else?
empathy between players
CK|MoarDed: Spoiler alert Bowser kidnaps Peach
empathy. in actuality, hate
I agree
*BOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM*
So now everypony can see how many times SuperBrony64 dies at Ray-Man
Sometimes i think Nintendo isn't that great, but then i look at Microsoft and Sony... and i see they Nintendo may isn't that special, but still better then the other 2
yup, nintendo are in lala land
all this for the price of 100000000 dollars!!
I heard that Portal is gonna be on the Wii U.
done with Slurry?
11,02:<
Vordox: potential trolling, EXCELLENT :D
SOSHAL VINDOW
SPOILERS: Nintendo will be releasing a wii game, a mario game, a zelda game and many many more stagnant IP's
Bobeh: just maybe
riving room
Cant wait to play Batman on Wii U
04No...
Mii game*
00,10problem is this is all based on japanise culture
04He mentioned forums
with the Wii wara wara, insults can be even more personal!
04But
so is the small game a controller
RAWRity: I rather watch him fail and rage at Remix 10
04Since we already said a mouthfull on that
13public ones i think
11,01What gaming IPs aren't stagnant?
00,10it wont transfer well at all to the states
0,5Already discussed
12:O
Sharing across time and space
0,5oh
I thought we discussed the forums enough
Sumica: I agree.
12!POKEMON
Soital, you are a 7Cobalion.
Cottencandy: Did I heard Portal?
04Is it public?
Sumica: and that's bad how?
Sumica true dat
Thats why we need ones
04I don't think so...
0,5Not sure
You forgot to mention that they're also making a new Smash Bros.
let's keep the forums for BN or something
inb4 privacy invasions
Sumica or europe
dem cuts lol
like Dishonoured and last of us
Sumica: Who cares about that "USA" That's so faulty and not even a country anymore?
Sumica: what, they don
mebers
11,01There are very few new IPs nowadays if you exclude the indie scene.
13yeah, that gets rolled in with BN
04But then PS has forums
04I dunno
t have discussion forum or games there?
04We'll figure something out
oh no, DONT get involved in my single player
yep
04ANYWAYS
That is precisely why I replay older titles
get the hell out of my single player
13at this point it would just be a matter of cost and administration, and whether the public would use it
Cottencandy:*Falls* uh oh. *BOOM!*
11,02Space and Time? O.O Time Machine
Vordox: the scary thing is that might be a reality by the time Wii U comes out.
Holy SHIT! THEY HAVE A SPECTATOR MODE!
04Now Slurry is done
04So
00,10I cant speak for europe as i dont live there.
11,01The economy is swaying against new IP adoption.
/me invades Chrysalis' single player :3
wii u it allows time travel
1,11public forums were originally jossed because we were already having issues keeping mod strength up with doing everything else at the time. I don't think that issue has changed in the slightest considering our discussion on that topic earlier.
OMGOMGOMGOMG
Everyone will be able to watch you clop :P
DAFUQ WIIU CAN TRAVEL IN TIME+
Browser are the keep to Mebers
Wow... they are making people be less and less social in real life by making it easy (nearly mandatory) to communicate with random people online...
They should have gotten hologram Carl Sagan to do this.
00,10wii phone!
browser based? so its completely bull then
That's awesome!
Regardless of Time? Nintendo has Time Lords working for them
11,01Spectation in SP?
Miibirth?
Nittany_Discord too risky, which sucks
Sumica: We're embracing quality and diversity, and not something like Xbox :P
PC?
04Nittany is up next, are you ready?
11,01You know why that is bad?
SHWEE DEE ES
Dayum.
/me drools
I can play WiiU with Emperor HiroHito
the MIIverse and the Pro controller sound amazing
0,14XD
11,01My only point is communication.
Nittany_Discord: Because it is shit
11,01But, yeah.
:p
One moa thing!
I got a 3DS
Nitt: There is? I love sometimes just spectating other games, this is for options and possibilities to do something of a more competative gaming
They're trying to be more like Apple
The wii u is going to be SO AWESOME
breaking news, nintendo discovered the internet
0,14I hope this'll be up later, i gotta catch up because DOUBLE RAINBOW
I'm sure this is how most of would sound speaking a different language too.
Sumica: why would it not transfer to the states' culture?
Map of the known Miiverse
one more thing
00,10and :to beanounced:
11,01Because the console can have forced always-on DRM.
prince-lemon: How do you catch updates so quickly?
jackiiiiiie
miiverse=skynet
11,01It's an excuse for it.
Not to be mean but...could they not have hired a spokesperson with a less heavy accident?
Nintendo 3ds... UGH MY EYES
game machine?
00,10diffrent mindsets in gamers Dark_Horst
SaxyPretender: you'll probably find it on the internet somewhere.
Cottencandy: *Walks to them* Netx time, Warning me if I heading torws a mountine.
game machine for me is irrelevant
TVnternet
STOP TALKING AND SHOW US GAMES
family + game machine is not an equation that should ever have a solution
Dat game machine/TV relationship
in effect the fam and the net
The relationship between the game machine and the TV doesn't NEED to be changed. You plug in the cords, the end.
just as long as it can play good games
:|
Nittany_Discord: :D That will never happen.... Right guys?.... Right?
/me remembers the wii want to play wii advertises
Games is only in two days
Chrysalis lol
this is all about Wii U
LOL Batman has no family, he can't experience Wii U like us.
pikorar: I hope that will never become popular
wowwwww
pikorar: x
00,10the miiternet
D
Ohai Shigeru
Chrysalis: It's always been a focus of NIntendo, just check at NES; GAmeCube and more....Compared to PSX and Xbox. :P
04Well, you were talking about having to repeat ideas in SRS
Great
What a nracisits.
04And you didn't like that
Now your paedophille grandfather can watch you through the TV!
Wow! So it's just like Windows 7!
So if you want to watch porn on the small screen
You can watch porn from your video game controllers now
why would i wanna do that?
No games? Then I'm calling it a night.
oh god everyone will see your porn
It plays on the big screen!
anad your folks can see you browsing porn
That acually sounds kinda cool...
I guess this means Tueday's Press Conference will be nothing but games.
DAT BUFFERING RING
NOOOO
Vordox, its something i always hated about nintendos recent pushes
Morning everyone.
11,02Hehe, nice :D
it does but i dont need that on a games console, that would be a cool tv remote
Falls alsleep
Hi XAX
That means you can watch TV AND watch TV at the same time!
allo XAX
11,02Hai XAX :3
family gaming always feels like just dumbing down
Chrysalis: Gaming sociality
SHARE ALL THE PONIES WITH WII U
11,01I don't know if it's just me or if it's a global problem, but there have been many times where I've posted ideas and topics in Skype that get ignored.
Allo XAX
tada PORN
Goodnight Bronystate, see you next time! :D
dat fanfare
hmm Watch Bronystate... with the wii u controller?
HOLY CRAP!
11,02twilight_sprinkle: Hahaha
So you can watch porn on your Wii U and use the curtain to block it from the TV!
._.
Dat fanfare
soooo i wont be able to clop discretely???
04Because things get washed away in Skype
Gamer_Luna: How can you fall asleep! Gaming stuff is on! ;)
SuperBrony64: I am so excited right now
Goodnight DerpSurge! Love you!
hey XAX hows your day been
OH MY GOD..Powerpoint!
04Because of realtime communication
So many people are gonna get caught with porn using this.
Well now im gonna flick shocker images to the TV while people are watching baseball or something
ya...we can watch porn
11,01Not always.
This idea is such a derp.
in reality: everyone spams the television screen with their shit
11,01Let me finish.
00,10.....so how many housholds will make use of that function?
GilDash: Its just Nintendo.
11,02Mario and Zelda O.O
04Go right ahead
CupcakeWarrior: Mii too
Sumica: I will.
11,02I'm listening ;A;
Sumica: none
pikorar: O U STOP IT :D
Mario and Zelda, why won't they die?
lol
Sumica proabbly as many as still use the balance board
You mean, great solution, right?
Miyamoto? <.<
Sumica: but it'll make for cool YOutube Parties
problems not programs
MULTIPLE PROREMS
GilDash: I can't understand the crap his saying :|
/me gives SuperBrony64 a Mario and a Zelda
I can't stop lovin' you, DerpSurge!
Probrems
Gamer_Luna: Listen better. :P
Gamer_Luna: can i hug you?
Darkts3: you can't chat on the IRC though. Wait. Did he mention a built-in keyboard? Or does he still want us to draw all our text?
/me plays with Mario and Zelda ^-^
Om: Whilst I'm not a fan, I know other people might be.
You realize how he hasnt given a price point yet? This is gonna be fucking expensive
11,01Sometimes for example, I'll ask to confirm a time for an interview. I get no response. I bring up an idea in the game dept. No response.
Ghosties: hello
wii beliete it can help!
Sumica: probably 3. and they will bash each other'S heads in ebcasue everyone throws something else at the tv
seconjd best quote by shigeru myamoto
sagas: LAWL!, no
wii believe it enables
"We believe...but we have no proof."
GilDash: I just like his accent.
sagas: I hope so, that might make it unsuccessful.
/me hugs Ghosties
smile smile smile
Alone together.
Wii U is best money printer
00,10guess i am one of the few that is asking why on this system.
MOAR empathy
sharing of more empathy this guyy REALLY doesnt know gaming
sagas: Consoles seem to be getting more and more expensive, so it's not a big surprise
Sumica: This is awesome
reckon the internet brower will actually have flash?
Sumica: You aren't alone.
I've got to go eat everybody, I'll be back!
Sumica: it'S like giving a remote to every family member and unleashing them at primetime
11,01It's like I'm talking to a wall or in an empty room.
/me nods
Bronysith Why?
http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nintendo_direct_pre_e3_2012/en/index.html
Cant wait For Crysis 3 in E3
It's a current Gen console. Wii U should only be $300.
Oh Nintendo
11,01And it slows things down and causes problems like missed events.
together better
/me scoffs at computer screen
Om: Well, I'm impressed he's speaking as well as he is. Gotta be tough.
Together is always better. <3
inb4 stalking
Together better? Uh...you need a verb there dude :/
best slogan ever
Gamer_Luna: nvm
13talking off the top of my head here, but i think that's a problem with authority
So...it has internet?
Acleps: But this isnt a console! ITS A FUCKING CONSOLE ACCESSORY!
Alone together?
13as in
Tov,but then you have the conotrollers
13who has the authoritative answer for X at the time
WOOP DEE FUCKING DOO.

Meanwhile: eeyup.
If there is a way to describe Wii U, it's "overpriced iPad functionality that existed five years ago"~
/me stalks CupcakeWarrior
Sumica: possibler
Petrified_Discord: Lol
/me is paranoid now 0_0
Acleps: This is getting out of hand

Cottencandy: *sighs* " As the pony walks down into the forest, The sun was going down. If only she had wings she could fly Out of this forest and grab help. But as unicorn, she can't fly. So she's stuck in the forets." I hate to it but, I LOVE THIS BOOK!
I wont
Dokuso?
Om: There are natural born English speakers that I understand less thant him. :D
DSI IS OKAY
04Kinda have the same problem with Art
he wants your family to watch when you play with yourself
13bystander syndrome too, it's likely we're all thinking "someone else knows"
Ohai MahBoi777
Dat Big Brother Nintendo
0,5See Nitt, I cant often answer your question in the podcast dept
04Exactly what Shizu just said
Who is streaming this?
00,10I dont know any familys that are gonna be able to make use of all this stuff
04"Someone else knows"
hey Petrified_Discord:P how are u?
GilDash: try living in kentucky. The accents are atrocious, lol
Is getting bored,so starts to play With Irish_Pony 's Hair
Please don't.
0,5because It's not my decision most of the time
the WiiU IS NOT ONLY THE GAME PAD, it is A NEW CONSOLE, because it needs MORE POWER for MODERN GAMERS!
04"Someone else will handle it"
sagas: I know... PS4 might cost nearly a thousand dollars. That's getting ridiculous
Sumica: So?
MahBoi777: howdy!
Nitendo: The Apple of the console video gaming world!
wiiuwiiuwiiu
11,01That needs to stop.
hey Sylandest!
Please provide something else besides the Wii U for E3, please.
MahBoi777: Not bad. Back on the grid after visiting old people :)
13indeed
PLEASE.
04I agree fully
MahBoi777: how are you today?
04But
WELCOME
sagas, please never say that again :/

04How do you make people talk?
lol
Gamer_Luna: Oi! *ruffles her mane*
11,01I know people are AFK, but I'd like timely answers to things.
TWEETING?!
Sumica: There is one thing you don't think about or are missing, options and diversity is never a bad thing, it is tere to be used only if you find it intersting enough to do?
lets spam it
tweetah
11,01I don't know.
XD
Petrified_Discord: that's good
I give no fucks about the 3DS. JUST TELL ME WHEN B/W 2 COME OUT IN THE US.
If the console is off, can I still play games on the pad?
GilDash: Never heard it before :\
04That's our problem ._.
Lil_B: You know it's true!
11,02YES
THANK YOU SO MUCH NINTENDO
04Negative reinforcement is bad
compreete
04But
bye Japanese guy!
tWIItter
THANKS YOU
Sumica: Just saying "who would use it all" is like "Playing every game" or "Watching every art" or "Seeing every movie"
I know Sumica, especially when they don't know it can connect to the internet
/me hugs Nintendo
04I mean
wow
Five bits says I don't care about anything that shows up at E3 at all.
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425350
04What else do we have?
Sylandest: I'm doin great, how about u?:)
13a third motivator is "i think i have an answer, but i don't think it's final, but everyone will think it's final"
THAAAANKS
00,10it's reinventing the wheel and calling it the miiwheel
/me hugs Nintendo
Sumica. The options and diversity is never a bad thing,. Really.
I hate the 3DS, DSI'S FOR EVER!
Irish_Pony: My mane is always ruffled :)
/me marries nintendo
well that was enjoyable
Sumica: Meel?
MahBoi777: tired, but happy to be free from work
13(see, trilogy month >>)
Well, at least the Wii U has promising online features.
11,02One more time :3
It was live?
Japan ftwwww
11,01Lack of feedback on ideas is causing the gaming dept problems.
YES
I cant wait till this thing comes out
Om: A thick Scottish accent can be nigh on impossible to understand, even in England.
04Do we maybe reassess teams?
YESYESYES
/me explodes
Acleps: If it gets that expensive, I might be willing to lay down the money and finally build my own gaming PC
lol
urghhhh
Tov, really, promising, theyt all look abysmal
Sylandest: finally free lol
wow it was live?
Wow.
everything i saw today is exactly the same stuff i coukd do with a laptop and internet
Gamer_Luna: Well then I can do this then...*kisses neck*
huh it was live
SuperBrony64 are you really /that/ in love with nintendo that you're willing to spend money on that crap?
i dont get how that'S innovative
Back to A:TLA?!
It all depends on total centralization to Nintendo's servers.
>_>
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425350
GilDash: Thick anything is hard to understand.
just old gen tech with a bit of a spit shine
YAAAAY
MahBoi777: eeyup, I am! :D
Sumica: There was so many new ideas into this, that has only been marked as "minor things in gaming" but they are putting more effort and visibility into it. And as for social aspect of it, it's quite a grander new change within gaming to make it more of a market ware
IT LOOKS AMAZING
WOO
So basically Nintendo E3 will be exactly as predicted: Wii U.
Well that was shit....
Meanwhile: Dont diss the Wii U, its awesome
11,02Meanwhile: ;^;
CupcakeWarrior: It's spit in a bucket.
Wii U is terrible
Sumica: Etc etc Console console Social etc local etc no internet etc etc... :P
CK|MoarDed: and some games TBA
still wont play dvds
13i think wiki will be helpful here, being a document everyone edits and discusses on, so that you can say "hey i think x" at one time, but it's not taken as set in stone then and there
Cottencandy: uh whats this *turns on fan for 10 secs and has her mane looking like a mess* Well, I know what it dose at lease.
I remember when E3 WAS the surprise. There was no pre-E3. *sighs* :/
Om: My point that he was easier to understand still stands.
13we have a tendency to just run with something instead of examine it to see if we can do better
sagas the Price of their producs in releation to what they can do, is better then ether Apple, Microsoft or Sony
i have to agree with meanwhile on his opinion here
thats a shame
cachi01: Many of which STILL aren't out. Don't forget that.
11,02inb4 Super Mario Galaxy 3
11,01Yeah.
I cant believe anyone DOESNT want the Wii U
THIS JUST IN: WII U IS A BIG FLOP!
Meanwhile: y u no liek?
04As long as you can make sure that it's not finalized, that it would be in a discussion page
GilDash: I never dissagreed with you on that.
Petrified_Discord: good times
inorite, SuperBrony64
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425437
at least they're taking advantage of the internet, but sadly the majority of consumers don't even know it can connect to the internet
I finally reached platinum status on club nintendo
11,01And ideas can die when not followed through.
Irish_Pony: "Giggles" Irish,you cutie <3
04"Possible Solutions"
Cottencandy: Rarity? Are you thier
13right, and would go out to the main page when ready
11,02Earthbound 3DS!
WANT
Gamer_Luna: <3
I WANT SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE 2!
Pinkies4thWall: Try because it's utterly pointless.
00,10yay they watthered down the pc and internet and boxed it up all shiny and new and want to charge me for it again.
i dont like the Wii so i know i wont like the Wii U... its just another gimmick that nintendo is making to get your money... and of course people will buy that crap...
SuperBrony64: how do you do that?
notice how he didn't mention what the launch games will be
SuperBrony64 in fils-aime's dreams
Sumica: What...?
What Sumica said.
i hope they annouce a 3ds lite
SuperBrony64: 3D Giygas. :O
GilDash: Just that some words sounded funy xD
cachi01: aw man I loved that game
Sumica: PC is NOT A FRICKING CONSOLE! IT'S A FRICKING PLATFORM
CupcakeWarrior: there's nothing new about tat thing. it'S a notebook with internet, stuffed into different shape
04Alright, so then that means the wiki would have to be made very soon
Meanwhile: alright, who is your god?
11,01At best, we need to work on timely communication on time-sensitive problems.
11,02Sumica: Moo ;~;
Because we'd much rather have this long drawn out speech during the conference in front of millions of watchers. I doubt 100k saw this right now.
Sumica: They are NOT the same
Don't get me wrong, if it's cheap enough I might be interested.
04If we're really trying to get this thing going, then let's not wait
SuperBrony64: Moo
Dark_Horst: So? Its till going to be awesome
Pinkies4thWall: I have no God.
But no price point yet. So I'm not interested yet.
11,01Yeah.
Lil_B: I dont know... I feel they are targeting the inexperienced casual users with overpriced and under-powered hardware just like Apple
13similarly, an idea gets brought up, maybe a brain dump or two on details, but then we don't discuss until SURPRISE it's time for the idea to happen
going to bed! Good night everypony :)
0,14>rainbow gone
Personally, I fear too much centralization. I don't have a Facebok account. I hardly ever visit Twitter. I have extensions on my Firefox to limit what Google and the producers of tracking cookies know about me. So this honestly scares me.
Om: He did very well at least. I can imagine how hard it would be.
I still have my DS Lite from launch day. Fuck yo various incarnations! :D
night Airpuff
Airpuff: Aw. :(
Airpuff: Happy tuseday!
gnight Airpuff! sleep well
Meanwhile: you don't play games?
/me hugs Airpuff.
Are we gonna watch something else?
0,14>forgot to take a picture of the rainbow with my RD blind bag
in other news, pinkie pie graduates from loonytoon acadamy http://derpy.me/zIgFt
Om: Thanks -.-
0,14I AM A FOOL
04Well then that's just motivation on the thinker's behalf
13then we start scrambling for details
Im guessing me and SB are the only ones who like the wii u then?
sagas: Sony will make a console which they can make the most profit out of. They wat it has been going is that they get more and more expensive
you people are all sheep... following the herd towards some new shiny thing that will most likely suck...
04That would mean they would have to dump their idea in the discussions page
11,02I want the Wii U now ;A;
GilDash: I know when I learned German, my accent was...Not the best xD but that was a while ago.
04Before it's time for an idea
sagas all of these companys are scummy, I just feel like Nintendo is the least scummiest
Midnight_Fyre but. . .it's so shin
SaxyPretender: take a pic of RD, post it link it, and call it good.
*shiny
CupcakeWarrior you two are the ones who need shipping to the men in white coats, and padded walls
11,01Should we start posting ideas on the forums/wiki?
soooooooooo now what?
Om: I really should try learning another language sometime...
CupcakeWarrior: that's like taking the engine and weels from a car, putting it into a boat and saying"that'S awesome"
13which should work well
04If we're doing wiki
0,14hmm, might have to do that
SuperBrony64: No one else wants it except us D:
SuperBrony64 timetravel in the future is technically possible ^^
0,14also, I'm interested in Wii U
I''l wait
Pinkies4thWall: I'm unfamiliar with that expression so pardon me, I'm part of the glorious PC gaming master race.
04Then the wiki should be up son
04*soon
Dken2021_: that's the Acme Looniversity. Did you miss out on Tiny Toon Adventures?
/me hugs SaxyPretender
Midnight_Fyre: funfact: whenever somebody calls people sheep or sheeple, they immediately lose all credibility.
13i think that's one of the biggest failures of the current forums, that all ideas are in one section
11,02Time travel is only possible when the Wii U comes out ;A;
Ran Ran Wii U!!
13things get lost
Kandarihu it's been awhile since I watched the show ok?
13we go to comment on some past thing and everything else gets pushed down
I want the WiiU to fall and break a hip.
GilDash: Its supposably good for your brain.
04You'd still need organization for the wiki too though
11,01I'm so used to forums that I don't know how a Wiki will work for real-time discussions.
SuperBrony64: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2107/
cachi01 why are you waiting at all
Wii U is a time machine?? awesome
>:U
its terrible
I just wonder how you will train everyone
I want the new SSB
13for the wiki, it turns into proper categories that don't care about when you commented
Chrysalis: NOPE IT LOOKS AWESOME
cachi01: If you are that huped for it, you will be disappointed
Meanwhile: I can see we're done here. PONIES.
Dken2021_: me too, but I still remember it.
sooo... when'S Sumica cominf back one?
but that's a different discussion
Pinkies4thWall: Ponies indeed.
*on
00,10You are right they are not the same. they are selling you a wattered down version of it
PONIES!
sagas: i dont care if ithas a zelda game on it I WILL BUY IT
Om: Well, there we go then. I should pick it up in no time. ;)
:\
So, I'll bet if the middle of the screen weren't white, we'd be able to see the buffering circle?
Cottencandy: Who likes Portal
sagas: except for the cd-i............
02LOL
what is next?
/me hugs Sumica. Why all the hate?
02I thought I was the only one who stalked Nintendo.co.jp XD
I cant wait! :)
13i think that's a probable reason we don't do idea threads much at all
GilDash: e_e not sure if there was a joke in there.
00,10hate what hate.
Sumica watered down, and covered in wool just in case you hurt yourself on a corner
cachi01: It looks awesome, but now you'll have the chance to find out IS it awesome. It might be useless after all...
dislike?
honestly super smash bros is the only reason i'm intreasted in this consle
well... looking up pics of the wii u and i have to say... it looks absolutely retarded... like the merging of the Wii and a DS...
Well, maybe we will see a Pippin 2 by apple this year :/
alexxm me too
inb4 when I buy it, I end up only using it for the internet
JUST GIVE ME ZELDA :[
cachi01: The zelda game will probably be playable without the wii u. The wii u just seems so gimmiky
seriously, people complain about drm and all that, then companies come out with crap like that as a console
CottenCandy: CUPCAKE AND TEATIME!!!!!!!!!
Om: ... Neither am I. ;) is becoming muscle memory for replying to you. :D
MY BODY IS READY
/me is still salivating
Chrysalis: The Wii U is NOT BAD :<
CupcakeWarrior: It is.
^
NO IT ISNT
It is.
CupcakeWarrior i know, its terrible
GilDash: Great now I'm just going to be getting confued.
10for Skylands
it isnt
04So, with that, I'm hoping that not only Nitt's point but the COMMUNICATION OVERSIGHT will be effectively resolved
More
aye and a rights structure
its not bad im just not interesting to me
Dark_Horst: Laptop is hardly handheld
11,01I just hope for timely communication.
I might camp out to buy this
Chrysalis: No, its a console ACCESSORY. Making it even more pathetic
04^
04So then
and thats if im being generous
Why is the Wii U bad? *ignores answers*
CupcakeWarrior: Lol
Cottencandy: DOSE ANYPONY WANT CUPCAKES OR TEA?
04What does that mean for SRS?
sagas: Why would they be available for older consoles? If it would be only for Wii U, Nintendo would force all Zelda fans to get a the Wii U. That's what Nintendo wants
Om: So am I, if it's any consolation. ;)
PinkiePry: what, you bolt yours to the table?
02nonono
02for Cube

Gamer_Luna: Of course <3
SuperBrony64: i think u have a little prob with the capture card
Ohai Wrek
04But no doubt ideas would be brought up
hi Wrek!
sagas: Oh... Well, if you ask me, I would want to get the Wii U if it turns out to be awesome, and not THAT expensive
04So then just make sure the idea is implemented in the wiki
04?
um whos going to stream?
allo there Wrek
Cottencandy: I guess... I'm hated...*Turns grey*
05hey

/me runs
04Works for me
nom nom nom
04Hopefully it works completely, though
I don't hate it. But I recognize that it's using technology that existed at least 5 years ago and am not buying into the blind notion of it being revolutionary and new.
RAWRity: They gotta force people to buy it someway and nostalgic fanboys have deep pockets
04Alright, well
/me gives wrek a pony
05sorry
Discored Cottencandy: I'm the hated one....

04Hmm...6:40 PM...not too bad
well, i myself woldnt need one. even if they were cheap as bananas. it's not like you could play fallout or battlefield on thaz thing
（￣へ￣）
But it has gyro control so I guess that makes the WHOLE thing gimmicky
ooooh new harvest moon game

Princess_Molestia: You're in and out a lot these days, your majesty.

Knowing what you know now, how much would you be willing to pay for the Wii U?
0,14$200 or so
GilDash: If you know what I mean
Discorded Cottencandy: I perfe a apple.
sagas: an overripe banana

GilDash: Now that had to of been a joke
sagas: up to $325
Hai
Dark_Horst: Sounds reasonable
sagas at least $250
599 US DOLLARS
cachi01, Kandarihu: wow... That's strange
I eould pay NOTHING! Because I'm not buying it :|
Kandarihu: yeah i know but i mean there is a equestria in africa

hey Herp_Derp hows your day been
/me glomps CCCP
ONE MILLION MONEY
CupcakeWarrior: Why does my sister always molest ponies?Whendid this start?I think it was after he trapped me in the moon.maybe?
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior
$300 I'm expecting it to only be a scosh more powerful than the HD twins
What're we talking about?
More than $300 is a rip off for a new console in this economy, especially for technology that has existed this long.
Please stop sending me mesages for a while, my hooves are full atm.
Gamer_Luna: Not sure
Pinkies4thWall: ALL the money
Is it the cost of the Wii thing?
CCCP: What's wrong? :(
CupcakeWarrior, Om: Oh, Princess_Molestia knows what I mean. ;)
Discored Cottencandy: WHERE ARE THE APPLES!* Turns evenmore greyish color*
Because if so, I'll take if Nintendo pays me.

awwwww
cachi01: Umm... I know about lyra, and I know what a plushie is...
11,02^-^
Whereas Sony is the opposite: they use cutting-edge technology, often before they've worked out the bugs. So they have their own host of problems.
11,02all the wub /)^3^(\

/me would use the lyra plushie as a cup holder
I just hope won't sell the Wii U for a loss like they're currently doing for the 3DS.

hey Resonantwaves
XDDDDDDD
NETFLIX HAS PONIES!
SuperBrony64: I wub u :3
Pinkies4thWall: Because people are willing to pay over $250 for an untested piece of hardware. It basicly adds a touch-screen tablet to the Wii. Thats it. I feel we did the same thin with the 3DS whne they released it for $300!
Nittany_Discord: I wonder if it'd hold beer? :S
NETFLIX YAAAAAY! :)
Gamer_Luna: Oh look movie! <3

pikorar: I hope you enjoyed your dinner :3
11,011/3 to 1/2 fail rate.
sagas: Except that $300 is closer to what it's worth. Go look up the price of a Wii and an iPad, put them together, I bet you they do not cost $300 bucks total at retail.
Acleps: it has a hole in well u must see the pic

Nittany_Discord: They *did* replace a lot of them. And my old gen 1 xbox 360 still runs to this day.
all the graphicswhores fanboys will explode in laughter at that article
dat Chobits
WHO
Doctor Who!
02I always wanted Nintendo to make a real controller like that :P
Doctor whoRE
Indeed I did, Acleps. Indeed I did.
YEAH!
uuh who
:3
ewww this show
yay
does anyone know if the simpsons are on netflix?
kinect/move?
YES!
:P
AAH BBC 3:
yay
11,01They did extend warranties.
Not Chobits.
cachi01: Yeah, I understood from the description. My imagintaion did the rest :/
ive actually never seen this show!! :P
what?
nop.avi
What a tease XD
11,01Still have gone through three of them, though.
O U
D:
NOO!
Stop teasin'!
Acleps: xd
I don't want to see Chobits
03I never said the other companies didn't make shovelware
oi... what was that?
Discored Cottencandy: PLEASE ANYTIME BUT LOST TAPES! IT GIVES ME NIGHTMARES!
sagas: you forget that it costs money to make things like this with expensive components. that factors into the price
Oh god
03but at least most XBL Arcade titles are worth getting
DOCTOR WHOOO!
03unlike WiiWare
only have 2 seconds, but HEY ALL :)
11,01But now I have my third PS3 failure.
05So. My point was to see if we can "update" the webchat client to show kicks and maybe even bans. this would sort alot of confusion on many points. a few that come to mind is that people will actually see kicks. and they will see the reasons. they will stop asking "why was he kicked" and so on becasue they can now read it themselves. since they aslo can see the kick reason its much easier
5for the regular user to determine if mod to mod kicks are joke kicks mainly due to the message that they come with are there. so that will save some explaining to otehr users and otehr users may have an easier time aswell. and when people are kicked then? I have noticed that 90% of the time they either rejoin and go "WTF WHY WUZ I KIKKED?" due to them being too lazy to read the kick message.
Gabriel Iglesisas? Yes.
5IIRC right now its black text on a dark grey backround so i can to a certain degree understand why some cant be bothered reading it. but if at all possible have the kick message (in white) be "you have been kicked by X [because]" then a checkbox (or something) that says "I have read my kick message" or something. and then you can hit OK and be on your way. combined with the possible future
5ToS and rules update. jsut something that will generally improve some of the flaws I personally find with it currently.
PARKS AND Rec?
i agree with this
eh?
DOCTOR WHO!
0,5HOLY TEXT WALL BATMAN
GOOD MORNING USAAAAA
11,01Current-gen consoles were just poorly made at the start.
I'm fine with Dr Who
yeah I know but people just like to single out nintendo because...its nintendo I guess
OR MLP
cachi01: ikr
DR WHO!!!!
CK|MoarDed: I dont know I can trust Nitendos prices after the 3DS. They literally had to come out on stage, lower the price by $75, and hold their head in shame
did i read star trek?
also i hate the new look wii u controller too its fatter :/
noooooooooooooo
cachi01 I got a feeling that it's gonna be a wonderful day

So much Patriotism... :P
Kandarihu: I just hate the show in general

Dken2021_: the sun in the sky has a smile on its face

Kandarihu: u are ameriican?
This is exactly like Family Guy
GOOD MORNING MEXICOOO
sagas: And they're selling the 3DS at a loss. The console costs them more to make than they sell it for.
I want to see what the anime is like
Puts head on on Irish_Pony 's neck to get comfy :)
CCCP: yes.
dat man
but back to that pro controller, damn...what were they thinking?
Kandarihu: :o i am too
Gamer_Luna: <3
03they weren;t.
face
I'm not sure if we have control over that or if it's a feature of the embedded client
lol
XD
11,02Kandarihu: What are you talking about? This is like the first time I've played this show in months
sagas: $300 is about right for Wii U's functionality at present.
Irish_Pony: <3
I DON'T WANNA WATCH THIS!
haha ITS ELVISH!!!
ok so now that I ate, what's going on in here
lol
Japanese
O_O
best part coming up
=DD
THAT"S AN APACHE
xD
XD
and he's dea
/me wonders if he should un-ignore Kandarihu.
Stupid
Lol.
:D
It seems slimmer O.o
lol
haha
And he's dead.
well crap
still I will say the 360 is the most comfortable to hold controller so Im happy in a way
o.o
02inb4: people thinking they're gangsters when they pick on new stuff
XD
or at least just longer
Denied
11,01Kandarihu: Why do you complain so much?
05well something gotta be done becasue as it is now its too faulty in my oppinion.
and ded xD
Discored Cottencandy: I perfered Watching someone playing Portal prelude then watching this crapo.
o_o
13to my knowledge, we can't set lightIRC to show kicks, which is a problem
XD
13Iris however does things properly
CK|MoarDed: Ill hold my judgement until I see it come out for a while and is reviewed
but for someone who tries to try different things I find it appaling they would do that with the pro controller
/me 11,01hugs StupidSexyCJ
Nittany_Discord: Think he's a pure realist
13two issues with making it default, one less important than the other
XD
1,11So, we need to switch chat clients again?
0,5Didnt Phase4 says this would be easy earlier?
Ow
13first is only lightIRC has the pony emotes, i for one wouldn't miss them
0,5Or something?
XD
His son wanks. Explanation.
dat hand
/me is hugged
8,6Charger!
NERD!
Elf power.
Awww yeah
Hygiene is best
and o hai Nittany_Discord
13second is that i get conflicting messages from ircops about whether switching is okay
CeilingKirz: AHHHH
0_0
STOP MAKING FUN OF ME!
Worthy hygiene lol
oh its Dan!
SuperBrony64: could you at least play The Goodes to balance out the bigoted ridicule? Oh, that show got canned early. Didn't it?
FlareChaser: lol
CeilingKirz: why u in my ceiling?
Hey look, it's me.
13from one i hear that making Iris default is perfectly fine, even with our spikes
I cast magic missile into the darkness
04Hmm
dat worthy hygien
NO, NOT THE TROLL KING!
dem ballons
sweater meat
LOL sweater meat
04You guys are talking about the webclient that's embedded, yes?
13from another (rumor anyway) i hear that someone's very against it, for server load
Bronysith: CeilingKirz is watching you clop to ponies.
-_^
dem fake bewbz
lol
02People go baww whenever someone makes something different, then they do the same when they re-use something old
=/
xD
02lol
11,01I should give you $5 for that drawing of me despite it not being 100%. I've grown to like it.
FlareChaser: nooo
/me noms FlareChaser and Octavia
Oh XD
XD
lol
FlareChaser: hes watching me buck with Princess_Molestia
FlareChaser: you can clop to things other than ponies?
Nittany_Discord: lol thank you
XD
rofl
:D
He takes a lot of balls to the face.
hey everypony:)
sagas: You can do that, just don't claim it's not about that price. $300 is probably about right. :p
Okay. I went too far with that.
02anyhow, bbl
test
ow
SANDVICH! :D
pikorar: i see what you did there
hey optimus-spike24
hai optimus-spike24
Hi optimus-spike24! I love you!
Well time to play TF2 D:
Blender sandwich.
I know
hi optimus-spike24
HI optimus-spike24!
Discorded Cottoncandy: Oh Really Discord?
xD
gamers nowadays
lol
Nittany_Discord: glad you liked it
xd
11,01StupidSexyCJ: Do you have a dA?
dat kick
hes a brony
CeilingKirz: did you say you want to be part of the vid or just support it
Hey hey hey optimus-spike24 :)
11,01I'd link you on my Tumblr with the image.
who got kicked CupcakeWarrior ?
Nittany_Discord: Who doesnt have a DA?
Logic.
11,01I don't.
dat fish drive
SuperBrony64: That "My family is perfect" sense...XD
Dat psychosis.
lol
Irish_Pony: me.
Nittany_Discord: WELL GET ONE DAMNIT!
Fish XD
i dont have a da either
CCCP: Someone named himself wreks bitch
04Guys?
05known issue that i jsut found by testing is that the join a cahnnel window pops up in front of the kick reason
Nittany_Discord: dat answer
13if it turns out the ircops are fine with us making Iris default, that would solve our kicking problem
klaus becomes crazy
CupcakeWarrior: wow
04We are talking about the embedded chat client in BronyState, yes?
lol
05yes
13yeah, lightIRC is poorly designed in that regard, yes ghosties
Discorded Cottencandy: I'LL GET A NURSE!
04Ah, okay
04Because I'm using mIRC
11,01I don't do Art. I found use in having a Tumblr blog, though.
04And I can see kick messages :D
Seeing as how everyone in Nintendo took a huge salary cut, I'm guessing Nintendo doesn't have a lot of money stored away.
....
klingon wedding.... that could be interesting
uhhhh what
13those of us on our own clients obviously don't have the problem :3
tbh the pro controller will have been a direct response to those 'hardcore' militants who spat their dummies out and kicked all over because they just want to keep the way they play games the same, I mean the medium is lik 40 years old now and we're still using buttons and controllers
/me follows Nittany_Discord on Tumblr
XD
BANGCOK
13but we're the minority obviously
04Yeah
...That one kid sounds like Dan from Dan Vs.
CK|MoarDed: Im just skeptical about a console accessory that costs more than the console itself.
conclusion: the webchat client needs some... modification
04It would be too much to ask them to get mIRC
Wreks_bitch, change the name
9,1indeed. Additionally, Shizu...Iris equates to a higher server load?
The reason I hate this show is that the protagonist is a mockery of a lot of what I identify with.
04They'd have to pay
???:Anypony Discored?
DAT PORKCHOP
13that's what i'm a bit hazy on dcd
And to think, Im a fan of the Orioels :)
05CeilingKirz: sorry
1,11Can't you embed something like miRC though?
Uh hello?
so they got what they wanted and then they'll moan its a 360 rip off...not denying it isn't because it is but you know there's no pleasing them
13my memory is terribad, but from maker i hear that it'd be perfectly fine, from rumor i hear kabaka is strong against
sagas: The console is going to cost $300, not the accessory. :p
Kandarihu: lol
hello everypony
lol
??????????
just reading the comments on IGN daily makes me laugh, and wanna slam my face off a wall
hi Wreks_Slave :(
11,01http://nittany-tiger.tumblr.com/ <- see.
/me follows Nittany_Discord
13you can't embed mirc, mirc is a standalone client
snot's a red shirt, how swell
I'm out! PEACE!
11,01Chatzilla is fre.
hey Wreks__slave hows your day been
11,01*free
best impersonation of shatner
Lolwat.
02Well it’s smart of Nintendo to have alternative ways on playing
dat japan
chekov. right
9,1also wouldn't mind lost pony emotes, but inb4 viewer backlash
02makes it more user friendly
YAY GEEKS!
11,01It's not as straightforward to use as mIRC though.
Nittany_Discord: What is with the black guy all green?
The wii u costs more than the wii, even though it requires the wii to work
chatzilla is just a client though?
11,01And it required Firefox.
awwww
11,01It is.
02of*
Dat delusion.
we are talking about the web ui right?
Bronysith: probably
13there's a ton of embeddable clients, i recall bronystate used mibbit at one point?, but iris is here, ponychat official, does what we need
Stan is a brony
13yes luna
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I don't even
Bronysith its likely
=/
Bronysith: nah he is an otaku
11,01Irish_Pony: Read the caption.
sagas: Um, dude, the Wii U is a separate console. It's not just an accessory.
:D
there wasnt a pony in there..not all is lost
Algebra
XD
yeah, but why didn't they just keep the old wii pro controller? since wiimotes will be compatible too
bwahaha
and yea we were on mibbit
XD
lol
sagas: So wait... The Wii U is only a controller?
in the old days
Nittany_Discord: dat Maid Discord drawing
oh wait scratch that sorry it'll be wireless controller xD
Bronysith: maybe an otaku but not a brny
even chatango :P
I'd X her Y
Discored Cottencandy: Back. Thing acting up with me.
Acleps no it's a system
13heard about that
02yeah XD
prior to thatr
No. Wii U is a separate console. Otherwise it couldn't do 1080p >_>
or is the wii pro controller wireles? I dont have one since I use my GCN controller
11,01StupidSexyCJ did that drawing.
The Wii U is Black. I'm so proud.
Dken2021_: Yeah, that's what I thought
Acleps: no the wii u is the console. The gamepad is the controllrer
/me glomps StupidSexyCJ
05one could argue that if ponychat "forces" the use of light IRC, their services are not enough
02it's wired
wii u is black? awesome!
9,1Chatango was first, but not IRC though. Stupid DCD knew naught about chat clients.
??????: COTTENCANDY STOP THIS BAD BEAVIOR! YOU'R NOT LIKE THIS!
Acleps alot of people were confused when they first revelaed it
xD
13not so much forcing, there's always a link in the corner to swap to Iris
Hawt
cachi01: ikr!
11,01If I opened donations for a bronyfunds outfit, I wonder if I could get the amount asked.
CK|MoarDed: Acleps: I thought it was just a controller
13but we bring a lot of traffic, especially on pony episodes
04Yep
xD
right well then yeah but still why didn't they keep the old design? This new one is gonna cause flamewars extroadinairre
13and can you imagine the spike for the premiere, they're probably already panicking about it
Xd
11,01I only need $150 total.
Stress zits?
/me has a dream that we will judge a console not by the color of it's shell but by the contents of it's library (and respect for the rights of it's users of course).
11,01Less.
Shakira's new single "WARA WARA" coming soon
/me flees
Kandarihu: HAHA
sagas: Nope. It's a console that features a new controller. It just happens to be backwards compatible so that Wii controllers work with it.
11,01Kandarihu: I know.
Acleps but the zombie nerd loser had a blacks Wii U Game Pad
I LOVE THE FISH XD
weeeiiiird fish
???: COTTENCANDY! STOP THIS! YOU ARE NOT LIKE THIS!
/me is glomped
04Yeah
11,01Back to the days of gaming when you owned what you bought.
I have a dream that Nintendo go into administration. If only.
13i vaguely recall they changed the lightIRC embed to better handle us, so despite assurances from maker that Iris should do fine, we'll want a definitive answer
04But um
The Wii U Game Pad had its own name, btw.
/me agrees with Kandarihu
testing Nr 2
Cottencandy_111: stop RPING
eww
CK|MoarDed: Are you sure?
05wreks_puppet
04Even if we don't miss the pony emoticons, surely the viewers would?
i have a dream that Meanwhile will admit to his love
of
I have a dream that CCCP will get hit by a bus.
Meanwhile: i have a dream that EA goes under as well as all call of dutie companies
0,14...it would cut down on emote spam
????: rping?
Meanwhile: :3
Bronysith: T'is a fine dream.
11,01Or at least you were treated like a human being when you bought a game.
dat jockstrap...MY EYES!!!
lol....
13there's that too, but less spam, and honestly it would make for clearer communication to me
....
Meanwhile: I have dreams where you get married to Trixie
0,14so I guess that could be an explanation to them
Dat son
Well, in any case, the most advanced gaming console I have (and probably ever will at this rate) is purple.
seems legit
Stan has a black son...
/me avoids trip
13kind of like skype, i have skype emotes turned off
:3
Bronysith: NOOO infinity ward also makes new games besides cod!
xD
00,10emote spam is kinda infrequent as it is though
D:
02well, the GameCube controller was a lot like the PS2 controller and they didn't have any problems
XD
CupcakeWarrior: dude that's creepy.
Meanwhile: i love valve and blizzard really. they are good companies
=/
Stan has a black son named Darnell....
cachi01: too bad. they are linked with cod
Meanwhile X Trixie forever!
Acleps: Black controller white console. seems unlikely
13if someone does (hug) or whatever, i don't see what they see, they could be thinking something totally different than what i am (not by much but you get my point)
Bronysith: I like valve more but I do like Blizz games.
ppppfffftttttthahahaha
11,01Infinity Ward has never made anything but CoD.
xD
Bronysith: yeah actually the created cod
TACOS!
Taco king is pissed.
9,1Saxy has a good idea
Meanwhile: valve is awesome
logic
*3 secs later* Cottencandy: wa? What was I doing?
Taco King? That must be SB
....
taco rage
XD
11,02^-^
13i think some of the pony emotes are making faces or something, such that when people use them they're implying something in addition to the base text we see
WOWO
oh god
XD
....
Oh god that pun.
DAT JUICE
dat jew joke
SuperBrony64: Stop beating up aliens!
Ive seen enought hentai to see where this is going
11,02okie :<
Dis role reversal.
13but yeah, filing under emote spam could handle it too
11,01I think Treyarch has made games before being stuck as a CoD dev.
:o
05,15For some reason, I really want to go west again, just to eat at Jack in the Box
LOL I want to see more taco king in future episodes
I HAVE NEEDS!
Nittany_Discord: yeah they made the siderman games
:(
Nittany_Discord: spiderman*
oh god
UUH
Hey Acleps, what time is it over there?
11,01The movie tie-ins?
Dat teeth grind
xD
Nittany_Discord: yeah the movie videogames
pikorar: 2:00 AM. Why?
DAT WINDOW
(ﾉ `Д´)ﾉ
dat innuendo
11,01Ooh.
Taking pride in not molesting patients
dat molesting unconcious patients
02Wii U Pro Controller looks like you mixed a PS3 and xBox 360 controller together
13it's not that it's harmful, i mean there's emote extensions for just about every client, lots do it by default
04I just don't know, I think viewers would get really pissed at the lack of pony emotes
Because, Acleps, what day is it over there?
02pretty good idea if you ask me XD
fluttercry: I've only lived East of the Mississipi river all my life. So does Jack in the Box only exist in the western states?
dental plan
05as for Iris. what cons does it have compared to lightIRC?
I just found Princess Molestia's dream job!
/me my dog licks my foot
O_O
pikorar: Monday for Acleps. Same for me. :)
pikorar: Well... Technically Monday...
Lisa needs braces
Gamer_Luna: Oh?
13it's marginally less user friendly, i think you have to enable the join/quit filtering
Teehee, he is going to look like a nerd now
dental plan
Wara Wara is gonna be the new meme XD
That sickly sweet scent of my fathers love with a gypsie
If this show had cutaways...
xD
13it exposes more about the underlying protocol, like messages from the server
PAPA RAPE?
I thought so, Acleps, I was just curious.
13but that's useful
oh god
Irish_Pony:
08,01i use it on other sites, and generally always switch to it when i'm using the chat embed on BS
11,02I remember getting messages asking for more Applejack emotes time after time again...so apparently viewers like using them.
04Is there anyway to keep the pony emotes whilst still having a client that would allow for the viewing of kick messages?
<3
xD
08,01and generally i'd agree with shizuka on those points
05any way to modify the default settings?
cachi01 is best rape
pikorar: Okay... You're not sure what day it is?
08,01yup
Don't you have school, Acleps, or are you out for summer or something?
08,01well, wait
Gamer_Luna: <3
Oh come on!
13yeah it remembers your settings in a cookie
yay im a rape! lol
A mosk?
???:ok who never wants Discored Cottencandy again.
SuperBrony64: ...Isn't the text just mirrored?
dat bullying
13for emotes though, no idea
O_O
08,01there are some things that you can only configure servers ide
XD
08,01*side
lol
XD
shoot me D
well like I said hte 360 controller is actually really nice to hold
:D
xD
XD
We have no leads so this week we'll be raiding a mosque!
13unless lightIRC changed so that kick messages weren't immediately obscured by the join window
13which i'm not sure can be done
but come on you can't deny that's far too similar looking to the 360 one
Oooooooooooooooo.............
:0 >: (
to be its own thing I mean
Acleps: Lucky!
:(
Am I hearing the voice of Patrick Stewart or an impersonator?
KARMA BITCH
:O
11,02Vordox: What text?
:D
ima back everypony
=/
xD
:D
Kandarihu: nope its stewart
SuperBrony64: The encoded text.
hiya Michael
>: (
:$
You're so lucky, Acleps, my mom is home all the time, she's a stay at home mom, and I have 4 days until my summer.
hi Bronysith
/me noms on SuperBrony64
sagas: Why? How's it with you?
>)
I'm cramming for a math test, Acleps.
/me hugs Bronysith
overkill
13also, kick messages aren't just for the benefit of the person getting kicked
13other people can learn from them
Dat godmoding
Princess_Molestia: are you almost done with him?
dat voice
dat freaking overkil
13but i'm not sure lightIRC shows kick messages to the channel or not
xD
I suppose we should talk to the ponychat admins about this
Princess_Molestia: Can I be next?
cachi01: no kill quite like overkill
Acleps: Im on summer break, but I couldnt sleep in a late as I wanted. Had things to do
to see what the options are
Fatty fat fat.
pikorar: My mom works, and my sister's is out of the house often.
is the fat kid a young peter griffin
Just how much hate and ridicule can be crammed into this show? This is, like, the polar opposite of MLP
ITS DAN!!!
02well, you don’t want to sacrifice comfort and functionality to say it's your own thing
he has a Trixie toy
sagas: I have nothing to do for the first 2 weeks :).
nice
Le wuut?
????:DISCORD! WHERE YOU MESSING US PONIES AGAIN!?!?!?!?!
13i think losing the emotes would be similar to us locking the side rooms, a short period of outrageous outrage because omfg it's different, then people see it's not so bad and are fine with it
ELVISH
the guy over there looks like trixie
RAPE
CK|MoarDed: i need to learn to speak elvish and the ancient language
05i think so too
-_(\(\(\(\(\(\(\(\(\
Acleps: You lucky SOB. I have practice four days a week
hahaha
DISCORD!!!!
xD
/me is nommed on O.O
"oh god, I want to hit you!" :D
04I take it we're not the only ones that use pony emotes in chat clients
I get stress zits as well.
omg
1,11Sorta like how the outrage of Youtube and Facebook were. XD
Litwick: Most people do
lol
pikorar: What do you have on the test?
DID YOU MESS WITH COTTENCANDY?!?!?!?! DISORD!
....xD
So I just looked in the mirror and I found a bunch of gre hairs O_O
05aye
grey*
sagas: What practise :O?
0,14Cottencandy_111, calm down and cut it out with the allcaps
better than sex X
pikorar: Cram harder! ;)
........ k.
04We're not the only brony site or brony chat that uses pony emotes...are we?
TIOTE
what.
O_O
tio
11,01I don't know.
TIOTE
Acleps: I play highschool football. I have practice 4 days a week
05dunno
...
Dat back.
13for chat we could possibly be
xD
Haha
XD
dat alien biolgy
Cottencandy: So what did I miss?
04Because if we're the only one that uses that
11,01I'm thinking if BronyTV does.
02tbh I don't think you could make shape for a controller that's more comfortable in the hand
xd
Okay. That was funny
Oh they're going to Bronycon
04I would be against getting rid of pony emots
sagas: Sounds tough... :/
04And just let people rage over OMG WHY KICK?
lol
....wat
02a shape*
xD
...
08,01okay, so apparently, Iris can use grphical emoticons
Q is going be at Bronycon
lol
neckbeards everywhere!
04SUGGESTION
08,01but we may need to get maker to put that in on the server
Acleps: It can be, but I enjoy the sport. Helps keep me in shape.
LMAO
oh god
LOL
I might go to BronyCon :)
XD
04Bring pony emotes over to Iris
13for me, emotes aren't really our core engagement though, the awesome chat is, and that stream box over there
Reference
04AND
Dem agents
He's making a documantary of it
xD
04have kick messages
pikorar: Everyday stuff I've never heard of :). I can't really help you out then...
Not even to watch!
13with time i think they'd get over it but that's me
Documentary**
11,02Dat BronyCon
pikorar: Crap. I used to know all of that. Still would if I had the formula written down.
lulz
xD moulder and scully
aww not even to watch?
GilDash, you're going to make it so difficult to study.
This guy.
04I'd really like to keep it because it's strictly BronyState for now, unless someone else uses it
probing is magic
pikorar: It is her specialty. You've only just begun :D
kurt is best ex
pikorar: I don't see how...
I would like to Irish up my drink
sagas: Yeah, sports are fun :)
XD
8,6there'd be an issue at first, then another at the start of s3, but everyone would get over it in time
Acleps: So what do you have to do in 2 weeks?
Well GilDash, I know them like the back of my hand, but I also have to explain them in a "statistical manner" so I have to understand them in depth.
04I'm just saying
04Why not have both?
13if we can work out to keep it in iris sure
/me hoofs Irish_Pony a bottle of whisky.
04Best of both worlds
dat debate
His, Sylandest, his.
Luke Skywalker vs Frodo. Frodo is toast.
13but not the end of the world if it ends up not being able to come along
Im gonna have to go with Star Wars on this one
this debate is a loss cause

wat
/me 11,01drinks GilDash
xD
Dat joke
Nittany_Discord: O_O
pikorar: Yeah, I did know all of that a long time ago. I still don't see how that means I'm distracting you.
lol...
Dang
:o
Nittany_Discord: Hey! It smells in here!
nerd rage
omg
08,01aye
sagas: Probably some work on a video. I'm not sure tho...
:O
you monster....
DAT SPIKE
xD
04But we'd really switch to a different chat client so people wouldn't be like OMG WHY WUZ I KICKED?
ded
Star Wars kid.
11,01It depends on what's better in the end.
GilDash: You were consumed
STAR WARS KID
zummmm
08,01i think kick messages are more important than emoticons
LOL
lol
GilDash... The quote "cram harder" doesn't make it easy for my concentration.
Obvious reference is obvious
wow
XD
04We'd get rid of something unique to us...?
Now if only that as funny
08,01aye
w/e we have the Laser disk untouched version on Piratebay
04Just so we could appease some angry viewers?
04Really?
But I do enjoy it, GilDash.
pikorar: Cram faster then!
Acleps: Oh interesting. What sorta video?
No difference, GilDash.
xD
08,01i'ts not just about angry viewers, though
:o
pikorar: Cram deeper?
wat
1,11No, it's so we don't have to worry about stirring drama in the chat.
da ring
0,14yep
04What do you mean?
Damn1
rofl
0,14people see why someone else was kicked
XD
what a nerd
GilDash! Please!
05its not jsut about the angry few
02!ping
pwne
13i assume otakon uses his own client, but consider someone getting kicked by the autospam
!pong
0,14they learn not to do that
lol
pwned*
haha
08,01it's about our responsibility to being open with our users
pikorar: What? It's good advice!
frodo wannabe lol
(I love it when you talk like that, GilDash)
04...you're not explaining though :I
9,1let's just agree to looking into the possibility of porting the emotes over to Iris
04Other than a few angry users
1,11Someone gets kicked. They con't see why. The come in, bitch up a storm and cause issues, and suddenly we have to ban them because they don't get a kick message.
pikorar: o_(\
Dat Whitehorse Comics.
dat heartless
13if they can't see it, it just gets worse, perpetuates that hyper strict jerk ness we mentioned last allstaff
xD
WMD?
08,01yeah
0,5I could care less about the emoticons imo
04Ah, okay
Smoooth
WMD?
04That makes sense then
Ok, who wanys a pice of me now?
pikorar: That's what I'm here for, baby. ;)
08,01plus, if they don't know what they were kicked for, they don't konw not to do it again
04But still
LMAO
Princess_MolestiaL ME
WMD?
son now we are a family again
04I don't want to get rid of the pony emotes
me possibly
08,01which is unfair on them if they then get banned
sagas: A video with a fighting scene. It's kinda hard to explain the story, but basically someone steals a person's item, and he fiights them and gets it back
13and @silverscreen, you can't solve that by just telling them before the kick, the message is gone after the kick
lol
and de end
04They're unique to us :O
lol
Princess_Molestia: me please ive been waiting my love
05not only that. kick messages arent even shown in chat. so OTHER users may go "hey why did dat user get kicked? i like him" focrign me to explain why
has fallen asleep on Irish_Pony
Bronysith: That sounds kinda desperate.
13^
0,5^
Meanwhile: I AM!!!
04I get all that guys
Gamer_Luna: <3
Ive go an idea
Bronysith: Oh well ok then.
04But maybe I'm just the only person here that likes the pony emotes
05ok just makign sure ghosties
11.•10«11WB10 (Drake10) 11WB10»11•. 10- As long as you clean up after him then sure
04I mean hell
b y e b y e
02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
That cop at the end makes my day.
02sigh
bye Pinkies4thWall
who is actually that cop ath the end of each episode?
Acleps: So a beat-em up? Please do share if you decide to make it!
04It's really neat, we don't know of anyone else that uses them
11,01Kick messages can't be seen in our embed.
another one?
seeya Pinkies4thWall
04At least not in chat
11,01I can see them.
lol dat molestia queue
08,01Ghosties: we all like the emotes, i'm guessing. but there are more important things.
He's the friend of the world~
sagas: If I see you I will :)
9,1let's look into porting them. I have a gut feeling it's feasible
02I only got 8 minutes into that video and now it won't play :@
05i like them to, but id rather have the kick messages
04More important than ponies? PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT
00,10I like them as well ghosties.
umm???
11,02I know for a fact that people bugged me about them before.
05agree with DCD
oh no CCCP and Dken2021_ i'm talking to the guy in the blue jacket
1,11I like them, but I prefer avoiding bans and drama over keeping them.
04So
11,02But imo, I find them annoying.
Pinkies4thWall oh
Princess_Molestia: Can I have a pic of you? ;)
Pinkies4thWall: ohhh!
04It seems that users do like pony emotes
00,10I dont see why we dont have an AJ one when other sites do though
Acleps: Ill hold you to it!
Michael a molestia queue. srsly?
08,01plus, if any of *us* are using the chat embed (which i'm certain some of us to), we can't see why people are kicked
04But then people want kick messages shown
04Maybe
sagas: It will have some jokes that you probably won't understand tho, but it'll probably ok
"Wipes eyes"What are we watching next?
04We should ask the users?
05<Sumica> I dont see why we dont have an AJ one when other sites do though
Look me up, Gildash.
GilDash: You could use google. xD
/me gives Dken2021_ and CCCP each a muffin
11,02Sumica:...MakerDusk told me they were going to add them months ago...
05so others do use them
00,10but I have to say the logistics are more important then the emotes
0,5I cant even see emotes
i dont want it
:O
0,5cause of mIRC
/me noms muffin <3
08,01what Sumica said
00,10yeah i have seen them all over the place
0,5so honestly I don't care what happens to emotes
Om, Princess_Molestia: Aw, no fun. :(
/me nomz Pinkies4thWall instead
/me gives Dken2021_ CCCP's muffin
11,01I don't see emotes either.
Invi: yup
Acleps: Ha well Im sure you can explain them if I dont! :D
!ping
!pong
9,1 they'd obviously choose the emotes though
NOOO-
13like i said, it's not our core engagement, if we can keep emotes then great, but if not, we're gaining more important things
04Maybe we should ask the users in a poll? Like "Which do you prefer more? Pony emotes, or viewable kick messages?" And whoever has the most votes gets the win?
0,5^yeah
double the noms!
/me breaks
0,5wqhat DCD says
sagas: Yup :)
0,5They wont care about whats obviously more important
13that... wouldn't be much of a contest ghosties, people don't care about people getting kicked, unless it's them
Princess_Molestia: Sister,whenand why did you start molesting?
:o
08,01Ghosties: honestly, i think at this point you're taking you're beating a dead horse here because you personally like them
Could we please just watch some Dr Who?
Ghosties, so the poll would be "do you like pictures" vs "do you give a shit why that random guy was kicked"
08,01that's just how it seems to me; i may be wrong
04It's an adaquate polling
Gamer_Luna: Oh no not again!
pikorar: Wait... did you say your summer vacation starts in 4 days?
PARKS AND REC,PLEASE?
Superbrony64: I HAVE AN IDEA
no need for a poll imho
04"Would you rather keep pictures, or find out why your friend was kicked by a mod"
00,10Caramel will rage at this but alot of the fanfiction sites use the emotes for comments areas
Please no messages now.
9,1let's agree to this. Let's cross that bridge when we get to it. If porting is doable, we would have discussed emotes vs. messsages in vain
11,01Only one defense for emotes: It's a pony touch to the chat.
Just CHOOSE ONE ALREADY!
04^
13Ghosties: it's easier to rage at us than be informed
11,02DECISIONS
Doctor Who please!
SuperBrony64: Can I has request?
03well brb reboot
Decisions everywhere...
superbrony64: you should start from episode 1 and keep going
I'd only rage at it if you were suggesting I start going to these fanfic sites
COMMUNITY please?
eh
yes
05ok
05so
11,02Irish_Pony: Yes? :3
lol bush
Yes, Acleps. I have tomorrow, when I take my math test, then I have my Programming I exam, then after that, my Engineering I exam, then I have to go to school for some stupid reason and then I'm free.
05no more about the emotes vs kicks
Could set up your kick alias to send the user the kick message in a /msg
I havent watched this in years
Instead of changing anything in the chat
04My only thing is that I just don't like the idea of getting rid of the emotes but if it means for better efficiency in the chat by switching over to a different client, then so be it
04But
05lets put in the log that if portign is doable we port.
04If we can do both
still no flying cars :(
13so resolved, we will attempt to switch default chat embed to iris, and attempt to port emotes
04Then let's do both
this isn't that old Dan_
Wii need U
04Yes
:p
pikorar: Isn't 4 days kinda....random?
Snuggles closely to Irish_Pony since his my comfy pillow <3
SuperBrony64: Episode 7
00,10I kinda see the poll being stacked in favor of the emotes, most cause the only people that will anser it are the regulars and they are the ones that will know why some one was kicked
/me wants his flying car
lolol
by years I mean 2 years CCCP :)
SuperBrony64: :3
04I only said the poll because then the viewers could decide
Dan_: oh
Anything else for Wrek's list?
We come to this site as a fan of a show about love and tolerance. So we watch a show about hate and ridicule.
04I figure they'd like to do more interactive stuff
Gamer_Luna: <3
08,01the viewers don't know what's good for them
Ikr Kandarihu.
0,5But Ty
How is it random Acleps? I would have 5 days but I'm exempt from my math exam. Well I will be if I can pass this final math test.
9,1we want the whole chat to see why though. Still: bridge, cross later.
04ohai HML
pfft bush
08,01or what they even want, most of the time
Hi Drake
Kandarihu: so true
0,5Are we letitng the users "vote" on anything else we discussed here today?
Pillowgun
Pillowgun?
bush is worst bush
heye verypony! I'm back!
08,01well, it's true
Dat Strange Pillowgun
i want a pillowgun
oops
I WANT ONE
hai Biglaw
Everypony*
:O
pillow gun seems legit
My last Sony console was the PS2 as it actually had a huge selection of games for everyone ;D
04I won't deny that...
1,11Ghosties, function and quality come over design and special effects. If we have to get rid of the emotes to allow us to mod better, the emotes are going.
200
pikorar: Well... school ends here on friday or saturday... ALWAYS.
00,10sad but true
XD
04Yes
13now now, we're resolved
lmao
04I...have to agree.
13next point
04Bacon
rofl
xD
04Favicon contest :O
04I have so many memories with my PS2
So I'm not alone on this? That's good to know.
05its been decided then moving on!
04Kinda...
Pillow gun! IT SHOOTS PILLOWS!
0,5I mean for our own decisions
Well Acleps, we're different, and we don't have school on Saturdays.
Man, the recent season of Family Guy was best season since the reboot. The dog was no longer insufferable and they toned down the Meg bashing.
04Ratchet and Clank, Kingdom Hearts...
0,5But ill take this to SRS
Yesssss
04Next is departments
Jak and Daxter ftw
04Individual ideas are done
oooooh
04XD
burn
04Lit is up first
And Acleps, this is an exam week, it's different because you can be exempt from some of your exams.
04With...
041. Chance to write articles on things such as reviews, news, opinions, really anything so that the Lit Team is doing more than newsletters and FAQ rewrites
xD
02Ratchet and Clank ftw

05,15Correct, I figured that could be discussed in more detail in the mini meetings. When do you plan to start having those?
:D
I love these childish CIA bits
Chilling out to some Zeppelin.

04Mini-meetings?
D:
I just got baby powder all over my laptop
NO
B++
NOOO! :(
13as i noted in a short talk last night, everyone has the ability to write a post for the front page, and there are categories for each department ready and waiting for posts to go in them
XD
Lol
I wonder how this show must've changed when Obama took office.
XD
11,02IT'S NOT MILK TIME
05,15what we discussed in the beginning of the meeting today, where departments have weekly meetings and discuss them in the TL meetings
Kandarihu not so much
hai SuperBrony64!
SuperBrony64: ITS SILLY TIEM!
crazy roger
Dollywood still exists and is still a cogent theme park. Cool
11,02Hai ^-^
SuperBrony64: then what tiem is it?
dept meetings would be at the discretion of the dept lead
i know where Osama Bin Laden is!!!! :D
hai SuperBrony64
Well.. I think we need to make sure first these mini meetings will happen
CCCP: the ground?
Roger is wearing Peter's clothes
See it's funny cause Catcher in the Rye was awful.

Meanwhile: the pacific ocean

Never seen this before. What is it?
CCCP: close enough.
04Ah
:3
04I suggested Wednesday
04I mean
/me shrugs
xD
CCCP: somewhere at the bottom of the Atlantic
:pL
11,01My notes say Wednesday.
04I guess each department can have their own day a week for meetings
Pinkies4thWall: Atlantic??
hehe
At least I know one mare that wouldnt hang up on me <3
:D
Water
Pinkies4thWall: hmph, likely story.
:o
atlantic is on the east
Nice face.
fangasm
O_O
hmm
XD
LOL
Dark_Horst: my brain just exploded from your sentence
Well, this show started when the president was the butt of every joke. Now everything about the current president is off limits and any negative comments are regarded as racist. So things HAD to change somehow.
GET AWAY BUSH GET...AWAY! NOW EWW GO
lol
XD
AAAH ITS BUSH
08,01i have work in 8 hours, so i'm afraid i must bid you all goodnight

08,01do you want to just do that in SRS or something later? or quickly now? (sorry to whoever currently has the floor)
dat face
XD
Was there any talk about how when Bin Laden was killed by a Navy Seal Team, Obama took all the credit, and his supporters were making it out like it was some hugely difficult decision and a courageous move for him to say "go"?
That's racist.
hello DeathStar :)
hey DeathStar hows your day been
LOL
Mexicans :p
Hello
:D ALL THE FUNNY
/me also loves Mexicans
doritos are delisous
BURRITOS ARE DELICIOUS. :3

Good think Scoota-Scootaloo didnt hear that
Kandarihu: Can we not bring up stupid politics?
I got to poop stan
wow
/me is mexican.........and hates bush lol
=/
05,15Alright. So things I've already come up with are having a point/counterpoint section, where two poeple can talk about their opinion on some controversial topic in the fandom. Also Slurry mentioned this but reviews of movies we watch would also be something that viewers could look forward too each week. Lastly, having people just write about something they like or dislike about the show
5,15or the fandom and having a place to talk about it.
xD
Dat mirror.
wutthe heeeeeeeeelll man
This seems like bush
XD

03hey, that's not to far off
03*too
04Flutter
05,15Yeah these are really rough ideas now and will be fleshed out more after meeting with the team. As for FAQ rewrites, that shouldn't take too much work.
04What about reviews of movies?
he hears your testicles
Smells like peppermint.
dat drunk bush
13but having, say, a page for op-eds, where it's made from a category of posts, *should* be doable
:D
xD
dat peppermint'
05,15Movies that we watch for movie night
04Because I already said I'd do a review for Strike Commando
Like a Bush.
xD
/me does the skull and bones
do do do do do
/me 11,01dusts Irish_Pony
dodododo
nice shooting tex
04Would that be posted in newsletter or just on the site?
04Or both?
wow
time to troll
O-O
I'm afraid I have to turn the volume down for the rest of the show, probably until sb switches to something that's not by Seth McFarlane.
>_>
..........................................................................................
13make a category for reviews, tag appropriately
the same way i like Gamer_Luna <3
10.
These jokes just makes me hate the guy even more =P
11,02ABOVE THE SINK
<_<
11,02ABOVE THE SINK!!
13our front page feed could end up becoming a mess, but it is possible to filter by category
Dat drunk
Oh yeah here they are
05,15It could be in both. Newsletter to call attention to it being done. But host it on the site.
Ruffles Irish_Pony 's mane
04o-o
SuperBrony64 Moo!
Someone should stream Mock the Week one night. ;)
/me bitch slaps frank
GilDash: Ikr.
00,10put a post on front page and when the back log is working would be cool to have links to the reviews on that
GilDash: oh my god yes please
,
Gamer_Luna: Oi! *licks neck*
GilDash: What is that?
wat
.....
0,14Irish_Pony, cut that out
Skull and bones like a boss.
13tempted to mark that as a full rewrite of the backlog, given how much i've learned since doing it
Om: An amazing satire show. :)
/me does skull and bones aagain
SuperBrony64 doo doo doo wa do doo doo
10Stupid BNC
Touch it.
GilDash: About?

^
ahhaahhahahahaha
Stupid Dog

13point is, anyone can write, and we can all make categories, which are listed on the right side of the page
03oh god, so many interlacing problems
OOGABOOGABOOGA
He has too much blood in his alchohol system!!!!
10Courage, lol
lol good ol' bush :D
SuperBrony64: You know such silly shows :3
cachi01: nope just ponie
xD
s
13if you file your post under a category, people can filter by that category to see it, or it'll be in the main feed as well
Ja :3
/me dances
slap
Om: the news, basically. Its an amazing show
xD
Dolly <3
Joleeeeeeen!
Well ok then.
05good song
13so for instance, clicking newsletter will get you all the newsletters (and just the newsletters)
dat pun
Agreed Wrek
10Why does my left ear always hurt around this time
Om: Basically anything in the news. It's absolutely fantastic. I think you'd like it, and I'm not just saying that.
Sylandest: Ahh. I don't get TV so I gess I wouldn't know
;-;
D:

03because people are talking about you

Sylandest: It costs more money...
04So then a category for Reviews which would then have its own page on the site?
xD

1,11and yeah, Nittany pretty much summed up the process right there.
<333
xD
lol
dat anagram
;AW;
horny midget that plays it self
13but a recurring thing like interviews should definitely get something consistent for intro/outro

Interesting way to get the plot going

logic does not work that way
/me hugs prince-lemon
11,01And we have a question sheet we follow. Our only impromptu questions are during the post-interview "bonus scenes"
1,11Set up a google doc of all projects and then give everyone away to see them, either through Skype, Email, Wiki or forums.

1,11Make contact with whoever you want to interview. Make set-in-stone times for interviews. Once we get the interview, we get one week to edit the audio and get it ready for publishing. We focus on one project at a time, that way we don't get mixed up and confused.

03they took the *uncensored* version of this movie, then censored it?
00,10the all peeing nutt
11,01I'm fine.
RaveBrony timed out
13it's not any different from, say, windows sound recorder
03oh wait, maybe not
11,01The windy part of the storm passed minutes ago.
13it's just better and does multitrack editing
1,11Separate what we have at the moment equally among the team. I want at least one interview to show on the stream by next week's BMN.
RaveBrony2: wait 2 minutes and ravebrony should timeout
cachi01: Oh, ok
it happens lots of times to me lol
11,01Winds looked to hit 50mph out there.

We got our oral task for english, and it's basically just a dialogue no more than two minutes from the entire Othello play, Koso
grammar is ded
Kandarihu: spike is a dog in this show though, but he must still have dragon instincts
GOD DAMN IT
her mouth is on the side of her head
Angelica = Tom sawyer~
This is whining! :P
[Dashie]: Shes a psychopath

Pajaro: it wont be the same in englsh
There's the choice of the very first scene with Iago/Roderigo
08,01i don't think we finalised anything
05yay i am lunas telepathic abillities

Nyria: yeah :/
CeilingKirz: If you're interested, the Server is up =3
OK CACHI
Nyria yep, they were trying too hard
go on strike!
Occupy the Front Yard
damn unions
lol
STRIKE! :[
And then at the end of Act I Scene III with the "Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies!"
This is how you explain Labor Unions to children
:[
I just realized there necks are SUPER skinny.
That one is nice as well
lol
THE FUCK?
as I've said before my personal favorite is the "gardners of our will" scene or whatever...and LOL
11,02Haha, if they do that today, they get fired.
yes
And the other show, the animal show with the smashing guy~ I forgot the name but I love that show~
i oick REPTAR
REPTAR
Well, outsourcing only happens when companies can no longer afford to hire local workers.
2 votes for Tommy, 1 for Reptar.
yeah that scene is Act I Scene II
Reptar! Fuck yeah! :D
er
all of them
III*
Reptar can be vice president of union
SuperBrony64: A sad truth...
08,01okay, i gather we were goign to have a live stream event at BUCK
Reptar of coarse! :D
Also the "Reputation, Reputation" scene with Iago and Cassio is good
|Discord|: the impressive part is when u realize they have necks lol they r so skinny they are invisible
slavery
08,01does BS have a presence at EFNW?
04I can Ctrl+F right now
08,01because that's the same weekend
04EFNW?
OMG,who remembers Kenen and Kel from Nick? :)

What the hell are they going to spend money on, anyway?
rugrats has politics?
hen3ry: I think you mean overthrow the burgoise
SuperBrony64: are you doing the netflix? aka shows that we are watching?
I feel like this is occupy wall street in a nutshell~
08,01and i take it you've not contacted them either?
yeah
SparkleButt: diapers
.....jar brakers

Also the kneeling scene
08,01fair do's

SparkleButt: they wan't them because they're shiney
I love that scene
wow
Adult problem in a kids show
I think this is CCCP's favorite episode
man I love the 90s
I don't need dimes! I need $20 bills! :D
You know what? They should just quit and start their own lemonade stand.
one LEMONLAID
04I haven't, but I would assume Super would probably go since he's close to the Northwest, as is Val
sagas: lol
xD
Dumb fabric
08,01it's just that, seeing as botha re the same weekend, we may be able to run an event there, and one at BUCK simultaneously, depending on what we decide to actually do
Fail
11,01I think EFNW is sold out.
shes poisening it!
lol
08,01it is, yes
HAI NS! :D
I dont want your damn lemons what am I supposed to do with these?!!!! Anyone get it?
HE GONE! :O
I WANT FUCKING LEMONAID NOW >:(
haven't said hi to you in days D:
Where Iago is like "Witness here you ever-burning lights above - You elements that clip us round - Witness that Iago doth give up the execution of his wit, hands, heart, to wrong Othello's service..."
They don't need to protest her stand like that. They just quit. But okay. They're infants.
BlazeAngel: lol
beesines
THAT LEMONADE HAS FEELINGS.
:|
yeah
MY BUSY-NESS
I've been busy
My buissyness is ruined
04Hmm, then I doubt doing anything now would be of consequence however it is something to remember for the PR group
^
but yeah Kosoveon
when life gives you lemon
idk what to do
:<
YOU DON'T MAKE LEMONADE
11,01The mod of Dr. Adoirable couldn't get into EFNW because it's sold out.
inb4 they murder her
they did all the work and no money

11,01*can't.

GOD
04I imagine we'll get a rundown of cons and then plan on contacting from there
YOU MAKE LEMONLAID
She then retired to the Bahamas on her golden parachute
So she closes down the factory and walks away with the profits

The part where Iago echoes Othello is done in the armoury
08,01we're under agreement with JdL and the docu crew not to launch ours until theirs finishes on the 11th June
I GOT SOME GUMMY WORMS IN MY VAN
[Dashie]: ooooooh that solves lots of questions i had like 8 years ago O_o thx
dummy worms
RIPTAR
WHOAAAA
08,01thing is, europeans aren't really donating to them
Knew it.

and Othello threatens to kill him is done at the beach
08,01so we still think we have that market
Oh my

08,01well, "market"
Biglaw: *flys into the air with you hanging on and rainbows flying out my ass* ADVENTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUURE!
This episode is just... -_-

08,01demographic is a more appropriate word
*rubin

Philomina.
After the jail scene
lolwutwrongchat
BlazeAngel ADVEEENNNTUUURRRE TIIIMMMEEE!
omnomnonom
08,01next friday, as in the 15th?
04As long as BronyState can be a big thing for BUCK
MMMMMMMM
Jakina, lovely name
Which is a bit weird but actually makes more sense tbh
guud
GUUD
08,01well, eurostream
phill has secrets
CHEW CHEW CHEW
08,01so the 16th
lol
Also the bloody handshake in that part was good
SECRET BUTT FUN
04It would be good that we could have such contacts with the International Community
/me 11,01chews
lol
/me gets into a corner and plays metal at high volume while saying ''dubstep is a lie, pop is a lie, JB is a lie''
I NEED AN ADULT!
lol
chuky is wanted
You earned a watcher, Biglaw
08,01i fully intend to have BS as big at BUCK as you want it to be
11,01I adult a need.
kids kids! you're acting like highschoolers!
lol
and heh, I'd love to do Hamlet with you :p
dubstep is nothing but the truth
CHUCK WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU IN A DRESS?
I could see how they could fall for chuckie, but phill?
sagas thanks!
04We plug to get JDL down at BUCK
oh i was worried
Ive always wanted somebody to draw me in pony form. I tried doing it myself, but my artistic talents couldnt do it.
YOU DRUNK?
jk
08,01honestly though, I need you guys to decide what you want to do and how to implement it. i'm up to my eyeballs in con stuff as it is
04That's us doing a good thing for the Euro bros
How did that work?
yeah
wait did that just happen?
cachi01: Metal is the way. \m/:[\m/
chucky??? in spanish he is called carlitos lol
What the fuck.
The mirror scene is god damned awesome, and the part with Hamlet and Polonius where Hamlet is like "Words, words, words!" is hilarious
inb4 GET THEE TO A NUNNERY
So why cant boys wear dresses? I find this cartoon to be homophobic
08,01prince-lemon: are you coming to BUCK?
lmfao
<.>
08,01how many BS-ers will we have there?
Blaze allow me to offer my services
"To be, or not to be"
so the moral of the story is not to wear dresses
sagas: Mmmmmmyes quite
sagas: i ki nd of agree
they crashed into mt. fuji
GilDash: \m/ :[ \m/
04I think Dari and Olly are trying to go
fatasses
04I know Olly is
I love how so many adaptions of hamlet
*kind
Yeah
^.v
08,01aye
-_^
cachi01: Fuck yeah. :)
sagas: wow :[
Wrek grab my beard!
have him hold yoricks skull while saying that line
04And I'd love to go
04But
04No monies ._.
As for numbers of BS members, I think at least...
mmmmmm kidney pies
when the two belong to two different scenes
hehe, they haven't seen the internet yet~
08,01oh, also, wrek's a guest of honour
They would be commiting a hate crime nowadays
11,01[Dashie]: But it's fun.
what are they, stormtroopers?
also I'm almost tempted to choose Act I Scene III just for the sake of saying "Put money in thy purse"
08,01so that's 4 of us
dem jews
JEWS
11,02Dat Einstein
hey!
yeah that's kinda weird
the to be or not to be is in act III, while the yorick's skull is Act V
Maybe 5 BS regs
Most ethically varied park ever
yes you haveto run from people lol
but Branagh's version is hilarious
08,01aye
0,14^
yeah
Not 100% sure who is going, and who is thinking about it
SuperBrony64: Grab my beard!
04Meanwhile should totally go

THE HORROR
00,02^

0,5lol
PinkiePry: idk
Branagh does Polonius' death well
08,01i wish shizu could come, i want to give her 1,000 glomps
CLAN OF THE DUCK
08,01anyhoos
I feel these Scotish babies should have beards
Scottish who wear kilts are secure in their masculinity.
Luna you locked it I think
I love the clan of the duck!
Oh my

Fuck ya! Our Scottish neighbors!!!!
lol
^-^
08,01if you come to me with ideas, i can give you the yay or neigh

XD
Those bullies... YOHOHOHOHOHOHO
Nittany_Discord: Just do it!
:D
lmfao
08,01most likely the former
he does
BOOZE

04Well, let's get PR going
I knew they were cross dressers...
04They've got a lot to handle
And they all grew up gay.
04Anyways
these parents can't keep an eye on their children for one second
Irish_Pony: I know someone Scottish IRL who always wears a kilt. No underear either, like the real thing. :D
04What else is there?

Irish_Pony: You can say fuck us, but you can never fuck our freedom!

DIPERS FUCK YEAH
Hey SuperBrony64, Grab my beard!

Nittany_Discord: Your lucky
And then Hamlet is like "Oh... you might pass him on the way to the attic as you see the rats" when Claudius asks him
:[
11,01Didn't even catch these references.
Dan_ scotts
Dashie YES
Nittany_Discord: lol the f is besides the d so u can mispell it

Nittany_Discord: i know
Irish_Pony: Moved away from him ages ago, mind. Still, it were awesome when he got drunk at parties. :D
Dan_: they're scottish
GilDash: Give it your best shot!
when i was little the credits for this scared me
yes XD
04Kirz thinks that we should only crack down on the worst offenders instead of blanket ban RP
sagas: Don't tempt me. ;)
cause i thought it was blood
XD
Dan learn your accents
the mel gibson version does the scene well too
oops, did I say irish? lmao
GilDash: lllllllluuuuuuuuccccccckkkkkkkyyyyyy!!!!!! :(

11,02Thanks for tuning in everypony ^-^
I WANNA WATCH FUCKING DRAKE AND JOSH
GilDash: For FREEDOM!
Not yet
13second!
04But I still think the mod team needs to really really really have restraint as well
Well, it is more of an issue with people not being able to use /me responsibly
Haven't had much time
11,01This is back when cartoons took risks and no-one got mad.
04As in
I meant scottish

GilDash: Grab my beard!

DUDE HOW DO YOU PICK THE SHOWS AND STREAMS?
04Yeah, the RPing I'm only concerned about within the team is Nitt and maid hour
/me grabs BlazeAngel's beard.
I liked the setting for Branagh's version
from the mod side, we've done hugs, noms, glomps, fruit, and maid, but nothing beyond basic fun
Dken2021: very.
Miss_Rainbow: you don't pick the mods do
the castle itself was such a troll

04I don't think he cares to venture back in BronyState
13anyway... i think we just have to keep a close eye on when people are abusing /me RPing
lmfao
0,5Silver does not
to troll or not to troll, that is the question
/me shot
hahahahaha
lmfao
04All I ask from Nitt is that he just takes better care to not overdo maid stuff

I'd say that all the people who chicken out on anything that can possibly be offensive to homosexuals, they have a fear of homosexuals, right? Perhaps that is true homophobia.
