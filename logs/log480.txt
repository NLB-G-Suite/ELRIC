0,5Oh
0,5yes
EEEEyup
0,5definitely yes
05yes
00,10oh yeah
04We need a ToS, absolutely
^
00,03mmmhmm
05a yes to gettign a ToS.
11,01Yeah.
0,5yesyesyesyes
0,14works for me, how would we implement it though?
11,01But aren't those legal documents?
basically: connect to the stream, agree to the ToS
O_O?
orange*
I learned that from taking the SAT.
04At the beginning of every log in to #bronystate?
Jamie is best jamie :O
/me activates lurk mode

the logistics can, of course, be handled later

Hot.
omnidirectional wheels are magic
hawt
I'll be getting people together to organize it and whatnot
I haven't gotten a hair cut in two and a half month... My hair feels terrible... :(
nice wheels
good, that's all for that
How do those wheels work :O?
that's all for my points
04Could we possibly include the rules in the ToS
magic
More hot things
absolutely
04So then THEY'D HAVE to look at them
11,01Yes.
05aye
it also means if they got kicked
they'd have to re-read it
11,01So they have zero excuse for rule ignorance.
Luna: if people feel like they aren't being organized well, they're instructed to tell the admins
all the testosterone
Um.
thanks Val
I get freaked out if I don't have a haircut every 3 weeks.

Today on BAD COSPLAY: http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-leave-cosplay-to-japan.jpg
Dat irresponsible commercial.
0522:40 then
04Are we sure that's safe?
FUUUUUUUUU- Time out...
not in here
The stream is probably 7 seconds behind anyway...
nonono listen
or,,
the agreement is that they are either of age, or have permission to log on
lol we're watching commercials? :D
10:25 pm* xDDD
04If they say they are of age
And then he kills 2 hookers.
04But aren't
04Then they're the ones that fucked up

00,10oki
did she say jaffa cakes?
we dont
04It's not like we have a legal team...
it's just a measure to protect ourselves
05but by stating it
its just frustrating
00,10we have them identifie a picture of VHS tapes
1,11We've always had that overhead. Only know we'd be protected from it.
We just write down a ToS and have a button that says "I agree to the ToS"
I thought I found the problem with the HDTV but no it was not
it really is the mainboard
04Nah
04VHS is too easy
lol
I liked the alcatraz myth they did
okay, but now the discussion is done, we're good

00,10We have alot of events that never seem to be anounced to the mod team outside of the group that comes up with it.
no i meant i wanted mythbusters
er.. Mythbusters!
Fun fact: Bringing pick-up trucks to a biker gang fight is a good idea.
YES
00,10Man of the team only find out about upcoming events around the time the viewers do
FUCK YES
this isnt Co
YES FUCK
tori should keep the beard
05DerpSurge: OFC IT WAS /FANBOI
D
1,11^ eyup...
this isnt CoD
How do you guys do that?
CoD isn't this
yes
If I was the leader of a biker gang I would just drive a pick-up truck with bullet proof glass because no one would expect it.
Kari does have nice mellons
13largely due to them being discussed in SRS
ooh
nice melons carrie ;)
Dat sexual Harrassment.
I also really like Kari's mane
You type in "yay" and a sound clip plays, how do you do that?
especially with that hat on <3
we NEED to keep SRS SRs
no more off-topics
^
and if someone mentions something is derailed
aaaaaaaaannnnnnndddddddddd iiiiitttttttttt
Dat 100 XXX! times
00,10I read through srs many of the events in the last 2 months never came up at all
no more "Fun police"
ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
pffff, built a 12.7mm pistol, then i'll be impressed
MELONS
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/epic-fail-x-ray-fail.jpg <- How did someone even manage that
KIWIS
This totally proves she's a lesbian.
I see now
WAT?!
Grapefruit
melons make for good armor
Strawberries
We'll each have our own Kari
BOOM
Oranges
it all goes back to communication
It feels as if they had to do way more work just for this episode than a "normal" episode :D
communicate

Dat magic o.o
if people don't respond
Kumquats
It's been good
no, you can still eat the melons.

00,10I presum all the events are at some point brought to the admins yes.
xD
OHHHHHHHHH
Tomatoes
04You'd think that...
13trilogy was just an off the wall idea i had on the list i hammered out, but we're at june, suddenly it's happening
they should be, yes
ideally: this is how it should work:
a team comes up with an idea for an event
03http://chzfailnation.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/epic-fail-nevada-has-its-priorities1.jpg
Pears
we discuss it, the admins present it in SRS and the forums
Of course the bulls didn't break the dishes; dishes aren't me
we get the organization handled IMMEDIATELY
04Ideally
Limes
Kari has a nice hole there

00,10too much planing seems to happen at the last min. we keep pushing things back
D'aaaaw!
XD
TOO many commercials
agreed
Tangerines
13from my point of view, let's face it, the forums are deaaaaaaad
oh wait thats not a commercial?
00,10yeah
11,01Our normal forums?
I like male bags.
not the beer!
Cantelopes
no why the beer
13yeah mod foums
waste of good beer
NO! NOT MY BEER!!!!
13forums is spelled with an R.. but anyway
A waste of beer...
/me cries
is this some kind of cruel joke?
NOT THE BEES
NOOO! NOT THE CANS OF-Wait, it's beer? Never mind then.
well, this is a committment thing essentially
that boy needs therapy
I am a shark, GIVE ME YOURE VIRGINS!!
they could have given the beer to me
if we want to forums to live
Raisins
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/21402779.jpg
we need to use them
Should play pony music while commercials
lolwut
I am the epitome of alone
wut?
04How about
11,01*store
Gouda
yes please
TOO MUCH DMAN ROLEPLAY
:D
I would vouch that
*DAMN
I've been here for hours -_-
13forums are too slow for all the communication though
hi everypony, how are you this fine evening?
roleplay is fun though.
well, as Nittany said
/me is the next level of performance
11,01Things can go slowly in Skype as well.
the forums are used to STORE the information
^
we should have a RP day
1,11forums are for finalized business. Skype is for discussing that business.
if something is discussed on skype, we store it on the forums
Bollocks I need caffiene
good idea
04Funny
13but we haven't used them have we?
04I made that already for the forums :D
*That's
11,01Hence my point.
MY MOUTH! THE CRYSTALS DO NOTHING!
"Blowers"
05that*
ask him nicely?
Ze Goggle Do Nothing!
The word "love" is getting played out, I may move to admire later, much more sensual.
drug him and tie him to a chair?
04I already made a "BronyState Important Business" thing way back
well then, let's commit
yep
right now, let's commit
04Where people would put down important info
check the forums regularly
lolsolsols
lsol
oh no
04And what's the punishment if you don't check the forums regularly?
03o.o
nothing.
04That's the thing, how do you make people check the forums
plan and simple
00,10again with the punishment
Bork bork bork!
no need for punishment
we can't run the site if people aren't committed
00,03>RP day
0,5No punishment
/me rolls
it's peoples OWN responsibility
00,03lolnope
04Why have all these things if there is no reason for people to do it?
to be INFORMED
/me is socialy awkard
doo dee doo
0,14Except even when people are reminjded to check the forumsl, they don't
04^
WORT WORT WORT! HALO FTW!!
04Exactly
13negative reinforcement is vastly inferior to positive reinforcement
04What would make them do something
05yes but i dont think there's a lack of committment val, jsut a lack of urge to use the forums
Do they really need to show this same Mythusters commercial again adn again?
04Saying "Please, guys, check forums" wouldn't work
13you set up a situation where we resent visiting the forums just as a way of avoiding punishment
i guess everypony is then!
how the fuck do you do that
Acleps yes
Myth Busted. Just like all the cherries in the world.
light beer and regular beer? lol
13pastebin, profuse use of pastebin
face plant
04Ummmm
13have everyone make or link accounts, keep things unlisted
04I uh
dirtnap
/me drops da base
i only seen "light" beer in the US.
*bass
Well...
just watched teens react to prom... LEGASP
04Yeah
Tory understands
we are all humans
13which is why i say make or link accounts
even they're ashamed they're wasting beer
DO NOT DROP THAT BEER!
04But I still am incredibly wary of pastebins now ><
and he learned from it
lol Kari
WASTE!!
:'(
Fun fact... This is a stupid myth bust because all object drop at the same rate...
04You're trading forums for pastebins
11,01Did someone outside of our group find something?
of course its a stupid myth
04One medium of communication for another
:D!!!!!!
04What's the difference
But we already no this...
..........
:'( waste of beer is cruel
13pastebins can be brought up from the person they are relevant to
Poor beer :'(
YOU COULD GET DRUNK WITH THIS!
Y u watse cider :(
13and only when they are relevant
really?
04Can't forums work the same
wow
13clearly they aren't
lol why?
04Especially if we were doing individual dept. sections
:O
and why is that?
04Let's face it
the bass?
13believe me i'm all for actually using the forums, but the point is we. are. not.
04It's all about convenience
potty
/me bursts into flames
TOILEETS
04What would make people do pastebins
why are the forums not being used?
DROP THE BASS!
04Where's the motivation
they should drop a bass guitar
i have farted
13pastebin grants nicer urls that we're more likely to look at
04That does seem to get more attention
05i could try to use the forums more sure, but it would be more convenient for me if it was under bronystates roof rather than effing zetaboard
flat
6_9
that is kinda disturbing
Oh my gaaaaah
*grabs
he sponged that like a pro
Put the bra back on!
poot
04Though we talked about that one other day, finally making forums public and more convenient
Is it possible to make an invisible forum?
wha
thank goodness
10Why do I keep DCing
lol
. . . dang it
Effing brilliant!
13at this time, hosting our own forums is a matter of cost and administration
can we make a tab on the main page that is only visible for us when we're logged in
YEAH Flatulence
and that tab just links to our zetaboards?
ponies are kewl
that's disgusting
13breaking a train of thought to take it to G is difficult
04Which is why I agree with no more finalized business in Skype
1,11Why not just put a link to the Zetaboards in the topic of our Skype groups/
http://fav.me/d529ybg
1,11?*
0,14you gotta take the good with the bad in terms of Skype
topic links haven't been working
Oh. I have no idea. I never learned that.
13that's a different problem
03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/homework-class-test-you-will-never-use-this-again.png
13topic links are worthless in skype
parachute panties
13i'll show you why
I'm liking these ponies with ponytails
0,5I have the forums in my bookmarks tab
13is there a link in the leads topic now?
Dken2021_: Lol
Oh my Gaaaah
not anymore I think
^
facehoof
0,5*admit
04What about making the forums public
/me uses Invi-powers to enter lurkmode
13i'll use SRS as an example since the banlist is there
It's as flat as her chest.
04That way we'd ALL have a reason to go to the forums more often
O_(\
11,01Part of the reason is because some of those topic links get cut off.
9.81... Okay. I'll put that on my list of numbers and call it later.
BUTTCHEEKPEEP
At some point possibly
I guess Acleps.

Sorry about that :$
04I say either we work to make the forums public, therein meaning that we'd all have a reason to be there every day or we come up with some other idea
What's up with all the text walls today?
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytRm_p03xSQ
I've seen it already!
/me 10is being pernickety about capital letters and you can't stop him
13honestly i think part of the onus falls on admins here, in that they are present in all groups and could easily compile a pastebin of important business from time to time
08,01i've just been reading the backlog, and can i reiterate my point from earlier: forums are a *terrible* way of storing info. to store info, an ideal solution would be to make a wiki.
Pollution!
oh bumi
my eyes hurt :(
*Persnickety.
Actually Saturn
dat sewer
13critical problem with a wiki, training in formatting
dat poo
if you could work this wiki idea a bit out
sewer sneaking
Ello Olly
i'm interested in talking about it
howadoin
04I'm not keen on a wiki, honestly...
05hmm
hello everypony
O_O
Acleps: Learning about the eco-system, the atmosphere, tectonics, etc.
we need something
08,01Shizuka: using something like dekiwiki or mediawiki, it can be done wysiwyg-ly
lol
A MONSTER
xD
one way or the other
pentapus
08,01it'd be just as easy as posting on the wordpress
awwww
baf
Cutest things evar! :)
Oh shit
they're sucking my face!
*bad
lol
RUN BOI
lol
that acting
04But wouldn't the wiki be public
13thing is, wordpress is using markdown, cause it's the easiest markup format that won't wipe out the tag overrides i needed on our pages
08,01Ghosties: no
dat sewar friend
04And yeah
evil hags
04You'd have to train everybody to use the wiki
04So
dose rymes
05in fact this is out of my knowledgebase, ill stay quiet.
04That's something ELSE people would have to do
13i tried training for markdown
04It's all about convenience
13no one listened
11,02I personally don't see what's wrong with using the forums to share information. Although it's not used right now as often, if the topics are posted with a good name and posts added that give useful info are edited into the first post, it should all be fine.
08,01not necessarily! there are ways of make it intuitive to use
azula has friends?
11,01Train me for markdown.
08,01like having a wysiwyg editor, as i said
more like... slaves
Luna, how are you.
Shoot!! When did this start!?!
aren't they more of aquantences?

Isn't the earth partly metal?
04We already have it, we already use it (albeit barely)
emo girl is emo
You cannot fathom the amount of fucks I do not give right now!
not friends
13i'd support a wiki but i see it getting as little use as the forums
08,01a forum is a really bad way of storing information, because when you want to look something up, you need to think temporaly
04Why do all the extra work to make a wiki
Aw baby!
>Pinkie's first word is "surprise".
You are bleak woman! xD
08,01it's horrible from a usability standpoint
until now
04Why do all the extra work to make a wiki
That...blew my mind in way too many ways
Hey look! It's Marvin's girlfriend!
bleak woman is bleak
11,01That
did he take down that boulder with a wooden stick?
04Training, Saturn
no, with air
04You'd have to get people to train
1,11I use googledocs for schoolwork all the time.
13Ghosties: then the onus needs to be on you and the admins to keep up on the training
08,01Ghosties: but there'd be no training! i just said twice it can use a wysiwyg system!
*sigh* nothing ever happens.
dat music
08,01oh
that tai lee
08,01okay, maybe i should explain that
00,10and wtf is wysiwyg?
freak!
cuck norris can do that with his hair!
08,01so you don't type tags or markdown, you click buttons
/me feels geekish :3
08,01like a word processor
All of the flexibility O_o
08,01it shows you the format as you type
pinkie pie
13it is
and then. . .
08,01yup
0,14just type and go?
Pinker Pie.
pinker
08,01yup
oh look avatar
11,01Yep.
...
0,14works for me
04yeah
04okay
wordpress is WYSIWG right?
13wordpress is using markdown
tai lee = impersonation of pinkie pie
ahh
13which is close to WYSIWYG
well it's simple to use
13normally wordpress would be WYSIWYG but that was incompatible with the style overrides necessary to make half the site work
O_O
Nothing, you jelly?
dang it bumi
Bumi consulted the magic conch
And then he did nothing. The end.
08,01aye
08,01this'd be completely separate, thoguh
Dken2021_ you'll understand
/me sits on the ground showing no expression
WHOA
00,10kinda sorta not realy
I would prefer using the forums, they are already up and running.. maybe some finetuning left and right
but we do not have re-invent the wheel
there are more pressing matters
Yeah cya all a bit later
:3
ewwwww
08,01Luna: i disagree. a forum is a fundamentally unsuitable system for information storage and retrieval.
it's a plaque!
STRUT
Dat old man.
04We're wasting resources on a wiki
hes good
because now instead of not checking the forums, people just wont check the wiki
xD
04Wasting training on a wiki
04Just use the forums
13with a forum
08,01Ghosties: resources? you mean the tech team working for a day getting it going?
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiwPPlvtNOY
04Timestamps
dat sick formation
04It's all there
L4D time
13you're thinking in the wrong direction
ZOMBIES!
zombies?
dey drunk
ZOMBIES
thanks for the games guys
zombies
08,01exactly ^
THE PLAGUE, RUN AWAY RUN AWAY!
04We already have a system in place, why waste resources and time and training on something like a wiki
ZOMBIES OMGMOMOGMOMGOMGOMGOGMGOGM
Rombies
o_o
they be in truoble
ITS MIAMI!!!!!
xD
overkill XD
PLAGUE
ding ding ding
Erryday ahm pentapox.
no touchie
04It would be about as used as the forums
/me has pentapox
Starting a realtionship just for the sake of having a relationship is the worst thing one could do.
04We already have a system in place

04YOU USE THE FORUMS MORE OFTEN
/me sickly moans because pentapox
FOOD
04...sorry
04But seriously
GilDash,what would you like me to draw? :)
08,01because forums suck
04Why do you want to switch out one thing for a system we already have in place
04Oh please, Saturn
04Now that's just base
13Ghosties
03http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-you-only-have-windows-im-way-ahead-of-you-i-got-windows.jpg
03LOL
13Bronystate 2.0
convient
and of course the toddler still lives
BABBY ADVENTURE 2
13we didn't need to go to wordpress
08,01it is, but it's basically the point i'm trying to get across
13we did
:3
That fart noise.
13but why spend effort on doing it when you could have stuck with the old site
04Yes
04Why spend effort on something that we don't need
04When we already have something that we can use
13you're missing the point
personally, I'd have to agree that forums are a horrible way to retrieve information
04I just don't understand
13why did we go to 2.0 rather than stick with the old site
BRILLIANT
Azula is such a tool.
Hi everyone
Such a sadist
03http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-keep-your-head-down2.jpg
release the hounds
Release the everything!
ALL OF THE ANIMALS
They're living in the olden ages... I had no idea they even regarded personal safety.
That's one awesome circus
elephantbear
04The wiki doesn't seem to be the be all end all to our communication troubles
/me noms Ponies47's mane
BRB I gotta go brush my mane
OMG BABY
13^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
BABBY ADVENTURE 2
dang it
OMASHU
04It's not that
Yes, because kidnapping is always a clever plot.
10http://bulk.destructoid.com/ul/23241-Kyubey.jpg
okay, how about this
08,01yeah, i agree ghostie
04But think about a communication perception
let's focus FOR NOW, on the not using it issue
they didn't even watch their son
:O
once people start getting that act together
and USING the forums
lol wut?
let's open up the wiki discussion again
stick
04Work on a wiki, which means expending more work on a system that won't be used just like forums after six months
/me wacks sakka
yeah, let him play with a weapon
EVIL BABEH
yes let the toddler play with the sword
/me 11,01sees that this is going nowhere
04Explain to me
It does.
But he always had the mustache.
oh wo wo cewt
0,14if it's as easy to implement as Saturn says it is, it's not exactly a waste of work if it doesn't get used
NO WAI
03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-troll-untitled31.jpg
03:ED
04And
03*:D
04We already have a system in place
0,14low risk/high potential reward works for me
04It's already active
04Saxy
04You would be for BronyNation then
11,02I'm all in favor of making the forums more active for now and then if it continues to be a problem, we'll consider going to the Wiki option.
:P
NEIN
don't jinx it
TRAP!
Fegelein!
bad joke?
huuuugs
emo girl is sooo emo
0,14copy + paste?
04But it just feels like you're swithcing out one gamble for another
lol
LOL i thought she said Kill me in
goodluck with that
tried that for the BS2.0 launch
you came to omashu at a difficult time, at noon!
08,01Ghosties: there are two separate issues here. one of usage, and one of tooling
05im willing to give the wiki a go
Omg shes like rarity
only much more evil and bossy
04No
04It's communication
04Look at this from a team player position, not a tech one
08,01Ghosties: yes, and that encompasses both those problems
lol
hai bumi!
shits about to get srs
HI EVERYBODEHH
hey bumi
0,14also, that doesn't mean I support BronyNation, that's more like high risk/mid potential reward
bumi got swwag
thornberry*
04Because I honestly see the wiki dying in less than half a year
:3
Well that's nice.
BYE BYE
04It'll end up just like the forums
bai Bumi
04Where we start and then stop
that bumi
good.
13Ghosties: i want to know about trilogy events, i currently have to wade through a time-based forum to find a thread that might be relevant to it
13compare
Aang says fuck yo shit.
http://theshhas.deviantart.com/#/d528n5i
been makin a homestuck rp.
13i want to know about trilogy events, it's there on the front page because it's a current thing
this is awesome!
i hope hes bending to fly up like that

Ice Ice Baby
Freeze baby Freeze
13i'm with saturn and we could put this together in less than a day i'm certain
FALCON PAWNCH
curses, floor hands!
FINALLY
04You're not going to change my opinion on this, the forum is just a much more convenient means because we already have it. If you want to do a wiki, fine, but I foresee it dying inevitably
0,14and given the fact that it's word processor easy, I don't think we need to worry about training
PWNED
04Dead
HAND TO THE FOOT
no*
04And because then we'll be back here
04Saying
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
13how about this
Aang when azula jumped: O FUCK
13we make wiki
-------------------------------------------
08,01Ghosties: you're not getting the point
WEEEEEEEEEE
wheeee
that wud be fun
13we point at the wiki and the forums
Cart surfing
13and ask "which one is more useful"
FTW
13THEN
13we decide which to keep
---------------------------------------------BAM--------------------------------------------
back on topic
08,01it's not about tryign a wiki to fix the usage problem, it's about using an appropriate tool and implementing a policy of usage
YES
why was the city bulit like this
MY CABBAGES!
JUICE CAN EVAPORATE ^_^
04It's about apathy and convenience
pwned
04Convenience and communication
hope i didn't misspell that
o.o
chi blockage
ULTIMATE PWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
08,01the convenience, i mean
13you don't believe us?
APPA TO THE RESCUE
04You can do it, go ahead

Is this lagging for anyone else?
Damn! :D
04I just don't think it'll work
Dat tail.
04I just foresee it dying
Chi block Appa I dare you
kapow
EPIC! :O
04And then we'll be trying to find another excuse to use for failed communication

04Pardon my bitterness

FAIL! :O
as far as forums or wiki goes, I could care less

Use the treephone
13a downloads page would be trivial to implement, but you would want enough content on it to make it look like it belongs
Acleps: Um... Then you should talk to my redneck friends.
the force
03and to keep "family" in their name
03for as long as the channel exists
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH
swamp thing!
13having just flaria's cursors would look a bit sparse, or worse
03I was a bit surprised to see some random religious speaker after watching Harry Potter

aaaaaannndd tentacle monster

04I kinda like the idea of a downloads page
as in, she is left handed
:D
Swamp thing is unhappy.
10Oh u
oh hey, a hentai monster
Gamer Luna nice pic
04But yeah, more material would be needed before implementation
05,15Yeah me too, but I agree that we'd need to have a lot more content to put into it
:P
Evening everyone
I've seen enough hentai...
13the menu is a bit of a navigational mess at the moment
00,10first time we get to see her bend after training
katara became more awesome in the ep

03yeah :/
03apparently it used to be owned by FOX

04Yeah
Leemuget.exe
04Wait until more content before deploy

04Okay then
those ambidextrous people won't care

13rules and FAQ could be under about us, though they aren't because no one would read them then
02news*
*ahem*
04Moving on unless there's some other reason to continue on the downloads
13but anyway, downloads can happen, resolved that we need more to put there
YA DON't SAY
10Politics, not hands
boom like a boss

03LOL @ that former playboy model talking about her daughters losing their virginity
03don't ask why I watched that

Acleps: Well, they usually wear camo hats, generally have shaved heads, they're usually very bulky, or very tall and lanky...
wait wat?
Huma huma huma huma huma huma huma
13well since the one idea from my get-out-of-my-head brain dump, trilogy month, is going forward
FLUTTERSHY
13the only other real idea i had there was more gaming events
13L4D2 went well i think
04Yeah...I'm kinda inclined to believe that...that's about it for now
04Unless, yeah, more gaming events

/me listens hard
11,01The My Little Investigations dev stream I want to do.
Hello, everypony!
If you ever met a redneck, Acleps, then you would want to punch his/her mouth. They're annoying.
04Okay, TF2, MLI
Or this FLUTTERSHY ------->:(
You can feel everything growing.
04Oh
04Uh
The Fluttershy talked! :( yaaaaaaaaaay
yep
it has been linked too
11,01A member build up that list.
03Instead, the channels feature the defamation of Christians <- now that, I can't argue with :P
Matrix
13so given that could easily build up a list of multiplayer games that most people could join
04So that could be done this Summer
Hey
I thought time was a social construct
queen luna!
The X's? haven't seen that show in awhile

She blinded me with...science
13it can go back

I understand that
Acleps: :( But I like the sea ponies, they're the only pre-64 pony meme that's worth mentioning.
its not that damn high!!!!
but I'm just not sure where the communication was
wat
oh. yeah it is
LOL
why the call was made without any discussion
Sorry, Acleps, I said 64, I mean G4, derp.
the amount of adorableness is NOT HIGH ENOUGH.
11,02Moo ^-^
NEED MOAR BABY PONIES
Acleps: ... That's a *hard* compromise...

WORDS
11,01PrincessLuna: is best pony.

04Okay
04Next
Booo Link
I share Yahtzee Croshaw's opinion of E3.
I like to don pitahs
046 And here's this: team conduct. I have noticed a few people here misbehaving and acting rudely. Now, I know it's not as bad as some things, but it's something to note and really should be toned down. We don't need people ignoring our own rules and abusing power. It's unprofessional and is just plain wrong. Know what's right, get things done, and have fun.
That's kinda cool..
THEY NEED TO WOK TOGETHA!
DAT SENSOR
11,01Dark_Horst: There are some bad rumors about the next gen Xbox and Playstation.

lol xbox controller
dat wii u pro controller looks nices
1,11For example: I stopped kicking other mods during BMN nights because I know it's unprofessional, but if I show up, like Wednesday during a random Let's Play stream, I'll just play around with my mod abilities.
AKA xBox controller copyright infringer 2.0.
11,01CupcakeWarrior: Don't know.
me gusta
to go with that
Owao = overall :D
13see it from their perspective, because they may not be seeing it as someone having fun with others
no one should be afraid to make those complaints
Cottencandy: <:(
When does the Wii U come out?
My Wii is not in my living room... Whatchu talkin' 'bout!?
xd
is every theatre streaming the same thing?
Distand locations aka. the bathroom
13we can be playful
11,01Kandarihu: I actually would like that.
I'm not going to put any names and whatnot (though we all already know I'm talking about myself), but if you feel like someone is being rude to you, just tell them
if there's a reason behind the fun kick and it's not just "hey, I can kick another mod, let's do that", then it's ok
ok. free samples for everypony.
Must... not...l look... at chatroom... some poeple are beeing stupid again...
again: communication
1,11True, but really if it's not during an official stream, they can't expect us to act too official and professional.
no, please keep explaining
competting?
13but they do
THANK YOU!
04Yeah, they kinda do
The Wii U is single player only, right?
13it's the same channel on and off movie night

Been busy starting up a company >.<
Dirty console playing peasants.
Cottencandy: :(
Yes.
you don't say :O
mind blown
I'm not impressed by this at all, and the controllers cannot be practical, they have to cost at least $70 a piece.
^
Kinda lost track of everything else
05,15Mii...Wara....Wara?
This looks like a waist of money
When is he gonna announce Nintendogs U?
Cottencandy: :'(
11,01Yeah. That's his child.
11,02pikorar: You do realize an Xbox 360 controller is $60...right?

Pffft, empathy

I agree
*BOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM*

done with Slurry?
11,02:<
SOSHAL VINDOW
riving room
04No...
Mii game*
00,10problem is this is all based on japanise culture
04He mentioned forums
with the Wii wara wara, insults can be even more personal!
04But
04Since we already said a mouthfull on that
13public ones i think
11,01What gaming IPs aren't stagnant?
00,10it wont transfer well at all to the states
0,5Already discussed
12:O
0,5oh
I thought we discussed the forums enough
12!POKEMON
04Is it public?
Thats why we need ones
0,5Not sure
let's keep the forums for BN or something
inb4 privacy invasions
dem cuts lol
like Dishonoured and last of us
mebers
04But then PS has forums
04I dunno
t have discussion forum or games there?
04We'll figure something out
oh no, DONT get involved in my single player
yep
04ANYWAYS
That is precisely why I replay older titles
13at this point it would just be a matter of cost and administration, and whether the public would use it
Cottencandy:*Falls* uh oh. *BOOM!*
11,02Space and Time? O.O Time Machine
04Now Slurry is done
04So
00,10I cant speak for europe as i dont live there.
/me invades Chrysalis' single player :3
wii u it allows time travel
1,11public forums were originally jossed because we were already having issues keeping mod strength up with doing everything else at the time. I don't think that issue has changed in the slightest considering our discussion on that topic earlier.
OMGOMGOMGOMG
Browser are the keep to Mebers
00,10wii phone!
That's awesome!
11,01Spectation in SP?
Miibirth?
04Nittany is up next, are you ready?
11,01You know why that is bad?
SHWEE DEE ES
Dayum.
/me drools
I can play WiiU with Emperor HiroHito
the MIIverse and the Pro controller sound amazing
0,14XD
11,01My only point is communication.
11,01But, yeah.
:p
One moa thing!
I got a 3DS
They're trying to be more like Apple
I'm sure this is how most of would sound speaking a different language too.
Map of the known Miiverse
one more thing
00,10and :to beanounced:
11,01Because the console can have forced always-on DRM.
jackiiiiiie
miiverse=skynet
11,01It's an excuse for it.
Cottencandy: *Walks to them* Netx time, Warning me if I heading torws a mountine.
Someday, they'll be able to connect the brains of families into a videogame device.
TVnternet
STOP TALKING AND SHOW US GAMES
in effect the fam and the net
just as long as it can play good games
/me remembers the wii want to play wii advertises
this is all about Wii U
wowwwww
00,10the miiternet
D
04Well, you were talking about having to repeat ideas in SRS
Great
04And you didn't like that
why would i wanna do that?
No games? Then I'm calling it a night.
11,02Hehe, nice :D
it does but i dont need that on a games console, that would be a cool tv remote
Falls alsleep
That means you can watch TV AND watch TV at the same time!
family gaming always feels like just dumbing down
SHARE ALL THE PONIES WITH WII U
11,01I don't know if it's just me or if it's a global problem, but there have been many times where I've posted ideas and topics in Skype that get ignored.
tada PORN
dat fanfare
11,02twilight_sprinkle: Hahaha
._.
Dat fanfare
soooo i wont be able to clop discretely???
04Because things get washed away in Skype
OH MY GOD..Powerpoint!
04Because of realtime communication
ya...we can watch porn
11,01Not always.
This idea is such a derp.
in reality: everyone spams the television screen with their shit
11,01Let me finish.
11,02Mario and Zelda O.O
04Go right ahead
11,02I'm listening ;A;
lol
You mean, great solution, right?
Miyamoto? <.<
problems not programs
MULTIPLE PROREMS

we need subtitles =/
You realize how he hasnt given a price point yet? This is gonna be fucking expensive
wii beliete it can help!
seconjd best quote by shigeru myamoto
wii believe it enables
"We believe...but we have no proof."
Alone together.
Wii U is best money printer
00,10guess i am one of the few that is asking why on this system.
MOAR empathy
sharing of more empathy this guyy REALLY doesnt know gaming
I've got to go eat everybody, I'll be back!
11,01It's like I'm talking to a wall or in an empty room.
/me nods
and then they witnessed the american Wii universe
http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nintendo_direct_pre_e3_2012/en/index.html
Cant wait For Crysis 3 in E3
It's a current Gen console. Wii U should only be $300.
11,01And it slows things down and causes problems like missed events.
/me scoffs at computer screen
inb4 stalking
best slogan ever
13talking off the top of my head here, but i think that's a problem with authority
Acleps: But this isnt a console! ITS A FUCKING CONSOLE ACCESSORY!
Alone together?
13as in
Tov,but then you have the conotrollers
00,10perhaps it's my merican thinking
WOOP DEE FUCKING DOO.
controllers*
If there is a way to describe Wii U, it's "overpriced iPad functionality that existed five years ago"~
/me is paranoid now 0_0
Acleps: This is getting out of hand
0,5^^^
*iPaid with
I wont
Dokuso?
DSI IS OKAY
13bystander syndrome too, it's likely we're all thinking "someone else knows"
04"Someone else knows"
hey Petrified_Discord:P how are u?
Please don't.
0,5because It's not my decision most of the time
wiiuwiiuwiiu
11,01That needs to stop.
Please provide something else besides the Wii U for E3, please.
13indeed
PLEASE.
04I agree fully
04But
WELCOME
twitty
/me applauds heavily
04How do you make people talk?
lol
11,01I know people are AFK, but I'd like timely answers to things.
TWEETING?!
lets spam it
tweetah
11,01I don't know.
XD
I give no fucks about the 3DS. JUST TELL ME WHEN B/W 2 COME OUT IN THE US.
If the console is off, can I still play games on the pad?
04That's our problem ._.
11,02YES
04Negative reinforcement is bad
compreete
04But
tWIItter
THANKS YOU
04I mean
wow
Five bits says I don't care about anything that shows up at E3 at all.
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425350
04What else do we have?
THAAAANKS
00,10it's reinventing the wheel and calling it the miiwheel
I hate the 3DS, DSI'S FOR EVER!
well that was enjoyable
13(see, trilogy month >>)
Well, at least the Wii U has promising online features.
11,02One more time :3
It was live?
Japan ftwwww
11,01Lack of feedback on ideas is causing the gaming dept problems.
YES
I cant wait till this thing comes out
04Do we maybe reassess teams?
YESYESYES
/me explodes
lol
urghhhh
Tov, really, promising, theyt all look abysmal
wow it was live?
Wow.
huh it was live
i dont get how that'S innovative
Back to A:TLA?!
It all depends on total centralization to Nintendo's servers.
>_>
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425350
YAAAAY
IT LOOKS AMAZING
WOO
Well that was shit....
11,02Meanwhile: ;^;
Wii U is terrible
still wont play dvds
thats a shame
11,01Yeah.
I cant believe anyone DOESNT want the Wii U
04As long as you can make sure that it's not finalized, that it would be in a discussion page
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425437
11,01And ideas can die when not followed through.
04"Possible Solutions"
Cottencandy: Rarity? Are you thier
13right, and would go out to the main page when ready
11,02Earthbound 3DS!
WANT
i hope they annouce a 3ds lite
11,01At best, we need to work on timely communication on time-sensitive problems.
Because we'd much rather have this long drawn out speech during the conference in front of millions of watchers. I doubt 100k saw this right now.
Don't get me wrong, if it's cheap enough I might be interested.
04If we're really trying to get this thing going, then let's not wait
11,01Yeah.
0,14>rainbow gone
I still have my DS Lite from launch day. Fuck yo various incarnations! :D
Are we gonna watch something else?
in other news, pinkie pie graduates from loonytoon acadamy http://derpy.me/zIgFt
04Well then that's just motivation on the thinker's behalf
13then we start scrambling for details
04That would mean they would have to dump their idea in the discussions page
11,02I want the Wii U now ;A;
04Before it's time for an idea
*shiny
11,01Should we start posting ideas on the forums/wiki?
13which should work well
04If we're doing wiki
0,14hmm, might have to do that
0,14also, I'm interested in Wii U
I''l wait
04Then the wiki should be up son
04*soon
13i think that's one of the biggest failures of the current forums, that all ideas are in one section
11,02Time travel is only possible when the Wii U comes out ;A;
13things get lost
I want the WiiU to fall and break a hip.
04You'd still need organization for the wiki too though
Wii U is a time machine?? awesome
>:U
its terrible
13for the wiki, it turns into proper categories that don't care about when you commented
Dken2021_: me too, but I still remember it.
but that's a different discussion
*on
00,10You are right they are not the same. they are selling you a wattered down version of it
PONIES!
:\
13but it's mostly that everything is in one category subject to being bumped down when comments are made
02LOL
I cant wait! :)
13i think that's a probable reason we don't do idea threads much at all
dislike?
well... looking up pics of the wii u and i have to say... it looks absolutely retarded... like the merging of the Wii and a DS...
seriously, people complain about drm and all that, then companies come out with crap like that as a console
MY BODY IS READY
/me is still salivating
^
NO IT ISNT
It is.
it isnt
More
aye and a rights structure
11,01I just hope for timely communication.
I might camp out to buy this
04^
04So then
Why is the Wii U bad? *ignores answers*
04What does that mean for SRS?
02nonono
02;3
Still: The WiiI is NOT an Hand-Hels device, It is a console you connect to the TV, that has this Tablet-Thing as an Controller... there are 2 different things...
Wut?
buffer buffer
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425437
lol
AND BUFFERS.
11,01It should be used for important matters.
Wii U is best pony
I don't even see how its hateable.
11,01What movies won the lottery.
04But no doubt ideas would be brought up
04So then just make sure the idea is implemented in the wiki
04?
um whos going to stream?
Cottencandy: I guess... I'm hated...*Turns grey*
05hey
13yep

04Works for me

04Alright, well

13to my knowledge, we can't set lightIRC to show kicks, which is a problem
XD
13Iris however does things properly
13two issues with making it default, one less important than the other

04You guys are talking about the webclient that's embedded, yes?
13from another (rumor anyway) i hear that someone's very against it, for server load
-_^
lol
02People go baww whenever someone makes something different, then they do the same when they re-use something old
=/

XD
BANGCOK
04Yeah
My DVART http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/
conclusion: the webchat client needs some... modification
04It would be too much to ask them to get mIRC
9,1indeed. Additionally, Shizu...Iris equates to a higher server load?
04They'd have to pay
DAT PORKCHOP
05CeilingKirz: sorry
Uh hello?

just reading the comments on IGN daily makes me laugh, and wanna slam my face off a wall

11,01Chatzilla is fre.
11,01*free
best impersonation of shatner
Lolwat.
dat japan
chekov. right
9,1also wouldn't mind lost pony emotes, but inb4 viewer backlash
02makes it more user friendly
11,01It's not as straightforward to use as mIRC though.
The wii u costs more than the wii, even though it requires the wii to work
awwww
11,01It is.
02of*
Dat delusion.
we are talking about the web ui right?
13yes luna
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I don't even

11,01Irish_Pony: Read the caption.

lol
even chatango :P
Discored Cottencandy: Back. Thing acting up with me.
Acleps no it's a system
13heard about that
02yeah XD
prior to thatr
No. Wii U is a separate console. Otherwise it couldn't do 1080p >_>
or is the wii pro controller wireles? I dont have one since I use my GCN controller
11,01StupidSexyCJ did that drawing.
Acleps: no the wii u is the console. The gamepad is the controllrer
02it's wired
??????: COTTENCANDY STOP THIS BAD BEAVIOR! YOU'R NOT LIKE THIS!
xD
Hawt
13but we bring a lot of traffic, especially on pony episodes
04Yep
xD
13and can you imagine the spike for the premiere, they're probably already panicking about it
Xd
11,01I only need $150 total.
Stress zits?
11,01Less.
/me flees
11,01Kandarihu: I know.

/me is glomped
04Yeah
04But um
eww
05wreks_puppet
of
0,14...it would cut down on emote spam
????: rping?
dat jockstrap...MY EYES!!!
lol....
13there's that too, but less spam, and honestly it would make for clearer communication to me
....
0,14so I guess that could be an explanation to them
Dat son
seems legit
/me avoids trip
13kind of like skype, i have skype emotes turned off
:3
xD
00,10emote spam is kinda infrequent as it is though
D:
02well, the GameCube controller was a lot like the PS2 controller and they didn't have any problems
XD
=/
ppppfffftttttthahahaha
11,01Infinity Ward has never made anything but CoD.
xD
TACOS!
9,1Saxy has a good idea
logic
....
taco rage
XD
11,02^-^
13i think some of the pony emotes are making faces or something, such that when people use them they're implying something in addition to the base text we see
WOWO
XD
....
DAT JUICE
dat jew joke
Ive seen enought hentai to see where this is going
11,02okie :<
Dis role reversal.
13but yeah, filing under emote spam could handle it too
11,01I think Treyarch has made games before being stuck as a CoD dev.
:o
I HAVE NEEDS!
:(
UUH
11,01The movie tie-ins?
Dat teeth grind
xD
DAT WINDOW
(ﾉ `Д´)ﾉ
dat innuendo
11,01Ooh.
Taking pride in not molesting patients
dat molesting unconcious patients
02Wii U Pro Controller looks like you mixed a PS3 and xBox 360 controller together
13it's not that it's harmful, i mean there's emote extensions for just about every client, lots do it by default
04I just don't know, I think viewers would get really pissed at the lack of pony emotes
02pretty good idea if you ask me XD
dental plan
O_O
Lisa needs braces
13it's marginally less user friendly, i think you have to enable the join/quit filtering
Teehee, he is going to look like a nerd now
dental plan
If this show had cutaways...
xD
13it exposes more about the underlying protocol, like messages from the server
PAPA RAPE?
13but that's useful
11,02I remember getting messages asking for more Applejack emotes time after time again...so apparently viewers like using them.
04Is there anyway to keep the pony emotes whilst still having a client that would allow for the viewing of kick messages?
<3
xD
05any way to modify the default settings?
08,01yup
Don't you have school, Acleps, or are you out for summer or something?
08,01well, wait
Oh come on!
A mosk?
dat bullying
13for emotes though, no idea
O_O
08,01there are some things that you can only configure servers ide
XD
08,01*side
lol
XD
shoot me D
well like I said hte 360 controller is actually really nice to hold
:D
xD
XD
13which i'm not sure can be done
but come on you can't deny that's far too similar looking to the 360 one
Oooooooooooooooo.............
:0 >: (
to be its own thing I mean
:(
KARMA BITCH
:O
:D
=/
xD
:D
>: (
:$

overkill
13also, kick messages aren't just for the benefit of the person getting kicked
13other people can learn from them
Dat godmoding
dat voice
dat freaking overkil
13but i'm not sure lightIRC shows kick messages to the channel or not

04Because if we're the only one that uses that
11,01I'm thinking if BronyTV does.
02tbh I don't think you could make shape for a controller that's more comfortable in the hand
xd
13reddit uses pony emotes, something of a metagame out in the other subreddits
04I would be against getting rid of pony emots
04And just let people rage over OMG WHY KICK?
lol
....wat
02a shape*
xD
...
lol
neckbeards everywhere!
04SUGGESTION
08,01but we may need to get maker to put that in on the server
Acleps: It can be, but I enjoy the sport. Helps keep me in shape.

XD
8,6there'd be an issue at first, then another at the start of s3, but everyone would get over it in time
04I'm just saying
04Why not have both?
04Best of both worlds

08,01i think kick messages are more important than emoticons
LOL

04We'd get rid of something unique to us...?
08,01aye
w/e we have the Laser disk untouched version on Piratebay
04Really?
xD
08,01i'ts not just about angry viewers, though
:o
wat
0,14yep
04What do you mean?
Damn1
rofl
0,14people see why someone else was kicked

08,01it's about our responsibility to being open with our users

04Other than a few angry users
Dat Whitehorse Comics.

WMD?
08,01yeah
0,5I could care less about the emoticons imo
04Ah, okay
Smoooth
WMD?
04That makes sense then
04But still
LMAO
Princess_MolestiaL ME
WMD?
son now we are a family again
04I don't want to get rid of the pony emotes
me possibly
08,01which is unfair on them if they then get banned
lol
like Saturn said though, the more important thing is them seeing why they were kicked, not the emotes
and de end
04They're unique to us :O
lol
13^
0,5^
04I get all that guys
Ive go an idea
04But maybe I'm just the only person here that likes the pony emotes

That cop at the end makes my day.
02sigh
04It's really neat, we don't know of anyone else that uses them
another one?
11,01I can see them.
08,01Ghosties: we all like the emotes, i'm guessing. but there are more important things.
He's the friend of the world~
9,1let's look into porting them. I have a gut feeling it's feasible
05i like them to, but id rather have the kick messages
04More important than ponies? PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT
umm???
11,02I know for a fact that people bugged me about them before.
1,11I like them, but I prefer avoiding bans and drama over keeping them.
04So
11,02But imo, I find them annoying.
04It seems that users do like pony emotes
Acleps: Ill hold you to it!
04But then people want kick messages shown
04Maybe
"Wipes eyes"What are we watching next?
04We should ask the users?
11,02Sumica:...MakerDusk told me they were going to add them months ago...
05so others do use them
00,10but I have to say the logistics are more important then the emotes
0,5I cant even see emotes
i dont want it
:O
0,5cause of mIRC
00,10yeah i have seen them all over the place
11,01I don't see emotes either.
!ping
NOOO-
0,5^yeah
/me breaks
:o
08,01that's just how it seems to me; i may be wrong
04It's an adaquate polling
PARKS AND REC,PLEASE?
no need for a poll imho
Please no messages now.
Just CHOOSE ONE ALREADY!
04^
13Ghosties: it's easier to rage at us than be informed
11,02DECISIONS
03well brb reboot
Decisions everywhere...
I'd only rage at it if you were suggesting I start going to these fanfic sites
COMMUNITY please?
eh

04If we can do both
04Then let's do both
Wii need U
04Yes
:p
04I only said the poll because then the viewers could decide
Anything else for Wrek's list?

Oh yeah here they are
05,15It could be in both. Newsletter to call attention to it being done. But host it on the site.
04o-o
Someone should stream Mock the Week one night. ;)
00,10put a post on front page and when the back log is working would be cool to have links to the reviews on that
