and snort them
And then turn it into a fucking space station

It should have been aimed at MonsieurLeFlour

And then use it to blow up some star systems
But he looks like such a nice old man

great rolling jafar on bluff and disguise checks
And then use it to destroy an ancient alien civilization

there's always lasers
ooh dear I shouldn't take it out
Youtube keeps throwttling my bandwidth with them

that would require touching
And's its pissing me off
4But the carpet touched them first
Well I have something that throttles so hard, it ends up throbbing
0I mean, it's a flying carpet. That ought to be worth a few bits.
he hasnt touched it yet
If its in the cave then it counts as treasure
MAH CRUIZER

13I'll be honest, I'm not in the mood for tuning in right now, no offence .w. I'll save the link for when/if I plan on tuning in a bit later
lol
I'd sell the carpet for a kebab
11lol, Benjamin
6The wall looks like GIANT FRIENDLY MUSHROOMS
ruby pupils
4By Darf14's logic, the ground in the cave is treasure and therefore they would be dead the moment his foot touched it

yes.

11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The second Disney animated feature to use fully rendered and textured 3-D CGI moving backgrounds in combination with the traditionally animated character animation, a technique that was expanded upon in the Disney short Off His Rockers (1992) and previously in Beauty and the Beast (1991).
11This led to the creation of "Deep Canvas" a brand-new technique created by Disney 7 years later for use in Tarzan (1999), which allows 2D hand-drawn characters to exist seamlessly in a fully 3D environment.

What about the Magypsyies?
She'll stay in the fridge overnight

Ashman wrote an initial treatment for the project and collaborated on six songs with

Yeah rube I'll try and roll up a char tomorrow morning or be for I hit the hay I'm pooped loong day

Damn, I can barely walk. XD
Nope. Someone added a sequel. "Muffins"
lolwhy
damasta: . . . . . . . . .
Cause they can, I assume.
Because the first was great. :P
I mean. O_O Uh.....
And the first was mediocre.

Damn you suck Rarity...
Derpy, you need a nick for Rarity and RD
alrigth cool
Wait, if Rarity doesn't like mud unless it's imported, how did she and Pinkie play tic tac toe?
damasta: . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Its a running joke
Fluttershy must have a thick hide.

If you couldn't lose in Tic Tac Toe, you couldn't win either
Hey guys I'm new to this channel, Question: Where should I put fanfic wishes?
That, or Diamond_Overlord_Rarity
Bon-Bon Overlord Lyra??
Apples_Overlord_Applejack
Orchard_overlord_Applejack?
Only if the other person couldn't lose either.
Nikita: Fanic discussions mainly happen in #EquestrianStudy
it's hilarious that Fluttershy's voice partly causes the avalalanche...
but if they're just short little blurbs or ideas you can discuss them here
LOL.
0Fluttershy, you're such a loudmouth....
Damn quick time events...
Lol, I was explaining "The fanfic that shalt not be named" to a friend who hasn't watched the show, and they thought I was explaining one of the episodes. xD
because she's so quiet.
A common element of cartoons, a loud voice doesn't cause an avalanche, but a semi-quiet sigh does
Applejack is good at sticking her hoof in other's mouths.
Question, if you were forced to smite any one pony from the mane six, who would it be?
13!pokemon
Rarity
STOP TAKING MY IDEAS!
Rarity
MAHHH

and the sigh is usually done in relief
Rariy.
Nopony likes her.

0Well, this'll be interesting
Hoses
because its a blu-ray, so the stream couldnt handle the quality
hah i got Isukra tho XD
Ah, ok.
6Okay, press play everypony.

Also I'm really sorry I didn't get that script done.

the only problems we had were counting, and one guy who kept spamming "PENIS"
I thought that party was next week, not this week, so I ended up out of time to write the script. :S
With a gun left over from Battlestar Galactica.
12o-o
6Well, this is where the lag started last time.
...is it normal that I don't know what's going on?
THE CAMERA GUY KNOWS GOOD RATINGS WHEN HE SEES IT
6Yes.

nah medics can heal all :D
0So how long is this movie?
I was thinking though about this script, voicing and devoicing 200+ people would spam out the chat a lot.
For muting/unmuting non mods.

Suddenly: SLIDESHOW

Is it not possible to downscale quality?
And the lag in intense. It's barbaric, but hey, it's home.
IS THIS MOVIE CURSED OR SOMETHING?
6They might be, Arc.
I think the movie file might be causing it
8I'm Neil Patrick Harris, your argument is invalid
I can't find it.
EPIC FAIL

Quick! Crush these rocks and turn them into a gel!
OMG it took me forever on the pinbal parts lol
But it looks great on walls

I have a helmet
so it cleans toxic stuff.
With portals in it
ok
Yeah.
8... not quite
btw how do i logout?
Unless the problem is bandwidth capping then increased bitrate should solve it?
This is especially annoying when trying to do the timed missions.
:(
Hasn't lagged for me.. yet.
0How bad was the lag last time?
you /ns logout
In the future Argentina takes over the earth.
Or just exit the client

Live ammunition? Is that a good idea? O_o
On a completely unrelated note, I'm installing Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 for PC.
8nope.avi
thats a waste of good ammo
In order to make that related, we need ghost recon ponies

of course its always a good idea :D

Oh yeah, I used my alternate account for this, because Ubisoft SUCKS AT SERVICES
6Coffee is coffe
it's glass from the future
that actually affects taste?
Ego much?
6That's all that matters
0>Implying coffee doesn't already taste horrible
i dont drink coffee i wouldent know
8except you steered us into a damn asteroid!
0coffee from a glass mug is actually dangerous.
why
Coffee rules.
6MonseiurLeFlour, you have disgraced yourself
All you got to add a cup of sugar to that cooffe
0since the heat might cause the glass to shatter
wut that^
8glass can shatter at high heat
It was nice working with you all.
Guys, guys. It's cool. It's space glass...
0The end
that was a short movie
YAY, now I can play Ghost Recon!

0The exterminatus! It does nothing!
they use nuke warfare you will see

8nuke it from orbit, its the only way to be sure
0Tyranids vs ponies
What's a carriot?
Too bad they do it in the 3rd movie
you know what i just noticed?
charriot*
Great Timing Carl
=/
Ah
The question is, do you hijack it by pulling the carraig, or the person riding it.
They're using the same banner for the third time!
13That movie was amazing ;w;
0Not even hive mind is immune to the magic of friendship
They're not Google.
I think this is the new "default" banner.
0Tyranids fought ponies in the third Starship troopers?
8DRAMATIC RIP
We have a default banner?
I like it
What is it good for?
WAR!!
Oh god a dead pony
Also, what's wrong with google? > : (
It's an innuendo isn't it?

It's um, honest?
they had that les paul banner

6...GAWD THIS MOVIE IS LONG
0Psychic powers are a no-no
0Do your part
I was thinking about what if Google did a MLP FiM doodle if the show becomes popular enough for that
0Buy War bonds
how?
I wish I had some cigarettes right now
/me 6has been cyndered.
Not long enough.
I don't like the corruping little girls part. this is the 'bright' side f the fandom
For the show's first anniversary or something, maybe?
6Still another hour...
bye guyz
Why do people hate OC ponies again?
nido, someone has to do it.
seriously?
6Yep.
aww
Yah, the OC ponies here are awesome!
0Eating bugs is heresy
hey look it's Bart again
6I've seen it twice already, so I'm not even watching.
Whats the nexzt movie after this?
It's their Mary Sue/Gary Stu-ness that sets people ff
6This is the last movie.
Hi Danfish.
6After this is post-show.
oh
?
Mary Sue what now?
6Which is whatever I decide to stream, really.
8IM FROM PONYVILLE AND I SAY LOVE EM ALL
0"We are gonna nuke these bugs kawabunga"
I'd still have three hours of giant bugs than three hours of Blue Man Group.
6Mostly PMVs
To me carmen doesnt look...
Mary-Sue = cliche, cookie-cutter, possibly god-mod OC
0The only way to kill a hug is through hugs.
whats the word
smart
can even be Canon char if badly written
Oh that
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue
Maybe I've been hanging out in different bits of the fandom, but I haven't noticed a lot of godmoding among OC ponies.
Some, sure.
well, it's ponies. XD
now in the SONIC fandom...
8dumb bitch
XDD
Well, most people tend to give their ponies wings and horns
Ha
Sonic OCs
all foot soldiers don't have smarts, they don't need them anyways x3 only combat smarts

REally?
I had a Sonic oc, then he just became an oc
0Rifle = brain
Hip fire for the win
And I think that's something only Celestia and Luna should have
quite
Yes
Okay what does OC mean?
0Fight for the honour of your unit!
Hm. I haven't noticed a lot of alicorn OC ponies. Once again, possibly just different bits of the fandom.
original Character
looks like MC lost
i know a lot of Sonic OC's and the good ones aren't Mary-sue-ish at all but still, the inexperienced ones...
Alright, thanks
Disregard rank, aquire bruises
Hi
0This movie gets so much better when you think Imperial Guards VS Tyranids.
lol
LOL
they form some weird ass imperial world I guess still
*from
Mmmmmmm *rolls arounds on the groud*
0I thought she said forget it, Rainbow
lol xD warhammer
0Imperial Guard and Imperial Navies don't mix
Also, Steampunk ftw
I would rather just stick to the ground if I could draw
i'm on apples, cupcakes, pies, muffin, cakes, coca-cola.
I think most people know not to make alicorns and such
6Warhammer 40k is win
i'm on everything.
what going on with the video quailty
i love the 40k games
0Tyranids are win
0Why so heretic Le Flour?
For the most part, most oc ponies have been decently thought out, I've not seen many alicorns or wildishly outragous ponies
I don't really get the whole RP thing anyway
worst time for lag
0Heretics have more fun
ikr
6Tyranids are AMAZING
If I had an OC pony I would stick to being earth, seems normal for me.
Some in the Drawfriend are overdone, though...
like the Death Pony
Nightmare... your sister...
0Dem zoanthropes
/me points to Celestia
Although I don't have an OC pony because of two reasons
chaos soldiers
0Heresy Heresy Everywhere!
I prefer to be human
And I can't draw
What about my sister?
hell no don't you lag on me, what with your awesome spaceships and stuff!
I prefer staying anonymous anyway
0Well, S10 Ap1 Lance, can't really compete with that
Something like a "Death Pony" is gonna be incompatible with canon any, doesn't matter how over-the-top you go with it.
YOU ARE THE SAME BEING
6Dude, I have a friend that will RAEP you with tyranids.
6Like, epically.
/me 6watches Icy with a look of wtf on her face.
I'd be a unicorn, because magic is awesome.
The army should have brought a giant can of Raid to the fight.
Same
I prefer science
My OC is Earht Poni
0Francis voice: I hate Necron Monoliths
I'd just like to state for the record. I'm not streaming when we do LotR.
And NOT just because of ponies
Though it seems like most unicorns can't control their magic nearly as good as Twilight
Nope.avi
Living in Equestria, though, the careful study of magic IS science.
Hey it's ODST... wai...
No, they just specialize in one aspect
remember laser tag and knife throwing and you'll live
Twilight is, for all intents and purposes, a theoretical physicist.
What mistake
I'm trying to minimize my OC's because while i have more freedon in their personalities than canon, i need to be extra-careful
But like spike said, Twilights talent is magic in general
0quick! Throw your knives at it!
More like a practical physicist
0shit's on fire
Most unicorns are I can do everything. Unicorns are supposed to excell above all at one specific skill
lol
kablamo

TS's Element should be Logic

She can use her talent to do the talents of others better than they can

Also, most pegasi are people like RD
Logic isn't a part of Friendship.
Twilight can do everything, but that doesn't mean she can do it well

Where are all the people who don't really care about the flying aspect
oo
kk
lol
Like fluttershy
6incoming SCARABs
marine rush
We have quite a few earth ponies
i usually only see pics of OC;s
What is the discussion topic?
0produce more medivacs
I dunno
fluttershy is an outcast of pegasus
It's like D-Day all over again.
MuffinS!
i love how they had no real plan
CivPony... I would play that.
Need more supply
OC Ponies
4DCD should probably be available for that
Earth ponies: Superior in strength, stamina and durability
That's the topic?
they thought they could just go in and shoot every bug to death on their own home planet
marine rushes don't work lul
0you call that big? I faced a Bloodthirster, now thats big.
4...where did Silver go?
not the civpwnies again
Best pony race?
Unicorns, intelligent, magic
No, I won't bring it up
0BANELING BOMB
That's the topic, I guess...
nuke fire :D
They do have a plan, and it involves charging at the enemy
Why are you writing in bold?
But it's still in the topic thing
Pegasi; speed, extreme personality
WHY NOT
Extreme meaning... well, look at RD and FS
You see I don't like that.
by the way fair warning, this tarren player sucks :D
0They should have standard bearers
X-treme
SHOOT THE LEGS
I could have sworn he was just here.
Fluttershy isn't extreme at all, flutterage and stare aside.
THROW KNIVES
Fluttershy is an earth pony with wings.
0Needs more tactical genius
0le lag
6DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
but she's extreme on the OTHER END
dang lag
And you can have my big gay dance. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5-lzRnsUE&feature=related
0SHOW THEM YOUR TATOOS!
Extreme as in, TOO calm and quiet
fluttershy can be pretty extreme.
No pegasus can do what Fluttershy can.
Well, any argument for unicorns OR pegasi could also apply to alicorns, so they're objectively the "best". Pretty exclusive club though.
More Speed and Dexterity
She doesn't like speed.
extremely psycho.
Wat
Pegasi are light, fast, agile and they can FLY YEAH.
Whoops wrong chat.
i'm on apples, cupcakes, pies, muffin, cakes, sugar.
hana ha haaaaaaa
WAT
HUH?
I need to go now. Have fun everypony. Thanks for the stream
To be fair, Luna and Celestia are goddesses :p
0take care brony
but they're not OC Ponies

0so is there nothing after this?
Hello?
Alicorns: We rule you
they mad bro
hi, lemons
You'll miss the best part. :<
OBEY
Nightmare Moon is hot.
I would only be a pegasi for the convenience of flying, not because of the ADVENTURE
did Cave Johnson Send you?
._.
0Is that bart?
0Antlions everywhere!
yeah
Although that would be awesome.
Yep, Alicorns are the best type.

I welcome my new alicorn masters.
0did he die?
where's life's manager?
yes
lemons, are you different?
Alicorns are basically uncorns with wings. Their defining aspect if their extreme magical ability.
0Sweet
I need to see him...
IM am your MUFFIN OVERLORD
he got ripped to pieces xD
Celestia doesn't even bother flying most of the time.
0there is still a chance!
In a place called #EquestriaAfterDark
Go blow them up for me
Thaluka is right
celestia has other people to fly for her.
Alicorns is pretty much all of them.

Run Away!
Uhh I'll wait for life's manager to go someplace else

Adult dragons, thus far, seem completely useless. They sit in a cave with treasure like Smaug.
We underestimated their ability to kill us in horrible, horrible ways.

RD naps all the time to make up for the allnight raves.
No clouds means you have to come down sometime
Pegasi should also be very light in comparison

Darn it
they can grow their own crops silly
Revolver: We have floating islands, duh.
what's stopping them lol
Really?
clouds are part of a nutricious breakfast
Revolver: Although, if we can STAND on clouds....
more like an heros
I see the elemtns of Harmony as the manifestation of the 5 emotions that make up frienship. Magic simply binds the world together as the 6th making it the odd one out. Which then in turn makes my theory rocky. Anyway, the elements would've first come into existance at the dawn of society.
Okay lemme explain this, we CAN grow food in the desert, Appleloosa proved it. We also have supply trains coming from all over equestria, and not everyone will listen to your embargo.
Don't forget the unicorns are with us too.
They're just not as good as earth ponies at farming.
okie dokie loki
Delayed post, but I was afk
Ivan...
xD <3
WATER AND SUNLIGHT make trees grow
I was wondering during "Sonic Rainboom" how the pegasi can keep simple things like clothes from falling through the clouds when they hand them up in their cloud furniture.
without that your trees die
without those trees you die
8OH
But... the Pegasi food spply is produced by the Earth Ponies. If they all die at the war, all Pegasi will starve before haing a chance of planting.
And we have plenty of BOTH

Bitch slap
u can still get water in the desert

Nightmare_Moon: eeeexcept where did Celestia get that spark of friendship? And also, why did she allow knowledge of five but not six? I'm not sure.
6...
0they need some siege tanks
But, what is unclear is this, is it required to be a unicorn to harness the element of magic? If a Pegasus or an Earth pony weilded it, would they be suddenly magical unicornesque critters?
Sprinkles is insanely fast.
aren't the ponies destorying the natural balance of nature by intervening ?
You know what Imma find the clip of the origin story.
i win the war
or firebats which ever
how?

6It's because it's currently generating in the Rs, and the trip I need is in the As.
I am so living in the everfree forest
yeah, me too. But it's 2 weeks!
Floating islands? dafuq
Plants + sunlight = photosynthesis = food for plants
and fair enough haha
[17:48] Siriusgamer: hey man
[17:48] Siriusgamer: one of my friends is a bronie
[17:49] Siriusgamer: how do i handle this situation
[17:50] MortalPenguin0X: ...
[17:50] MortalPenguin0X: Dunno
[17:50] MortalPenguin0X: IF he doesn't try to convert you
[17:50] MortalPenguin0X: everything's fine
[17:50] Siriusgamer: he did
[17:50] Siriusgamer: hes like
[17:50] MortalPenguin0X: then run like hell.
[17:50] Siriusgamer: YOU GOTTA WATCH DIS SHIT MAN
don't forget about all the land you guys abandoned ivan
[17:50] Siriusgamer: and im like NO MAN
True, everfree is also a good base
a normal day in Xfire
we use that too
you're stuck in a useless desert.
6I have more Rarity trips than any humen could possibly need.
Clouds move on their own
Revolver: Or GIANT MOUNTAINS or something...
You can't have a safe base
without clouds
Revolver: No, the don't.
Celestia changes that bro
the lag is ruining it...
I've already had one decent one generated for what I wanted, and I use that. Just looking for some more if I ever want them
*they
We are experts at ground combat
and so many undiscover thing that ay ion the everfree forest
Intro doesn't clear it up - there is a scene with only 5 elements however
if not....
So fighting us without a cloud base is suicide
6I use my DONUT one currently.
let me recheck the intro
well lets just say it isn't safe in the everfree forest
are you kidding me? That's 14 times this thing has dropped me today!
We'll manage
8i like the donut one
We did in the desert
you'll all be mauled to death by creatures one by one.
Revolver: We CONTROL the clouds. We are the Pegusi. (/DUne 200 referance over)
AND UNDER THE OPRESSIVE RULE OF THE UNICORNS
you just need to use your survive skill and youll be fine
I wanted one with rainbow in it, managed to get raINbow.0s
Clouds aren't natural in the everfree
What are "Pegusi"?
so all is good so far :3
You should know that
*Pegasi
So, you're now banished to the everfree forest
RD said so
0Searching for one with Rainbow right now
Ivan is right
My name is too long for a tripcode
9 letters.
Our bases are in the everfree and the desert
0USE YOUR KNIFE
Pegasi can't control weather on wild places such as Everfree forest
*sighs*
Revolver: Places you can't control?
6Trips generate 10 letters
Rafasde: You're extrapolating
Reload !!!
that are dangerous
I am? How? Please tell me.
We send rebels to infiltrate equestria and sabatoge important strategic locations in pegasi adn unicorn territory
Hi everypony!
and kill ponies.
0in the future, you don't need to reload
AVeryStrange: In the opening sequence, they show the pedistal with the 5 elements, they never show her using 5 or 6 though, which I can only conclude, the elements of harmony were always on the pedestal in the Everfree Castle minus the 6th.
Clouds not being "natural" by their definition does not imply pegasus ponies are unable to interact with/control them
well hide then
0PROMOTIONS
In the future armor is completely useless
Combustible lemons sends out CELESTIA!
Living in the everfree forest wasn't going to be easy
OP
OP
SHE IS OP
yes rip it out
Getting my name specifically for a tripcode would take too long is what I'm saying
CELESTIA used BANISH TO THE MOON
Ergo, Celestia did not use all 6 to banish me. She only had the magic to banish me, not cleanse me
last game of today's Dreamhack SC2 matches is underway D: D:
0in the future heavy weaponry isnt used
let it bleed
0in the future, you don't need to aim.
best idea :D
Very, but they IMPLY that they're different and something about not control on the show.
12Did you get my text Nick? ovO
Why pull it out?
FLAWLESS VICTORY.
O_o
I USED NOT CARING ABOUT HER, SO I'M NOT BANISHED
Nightmare_Moon: That's pretty much what I got from it as well, but right after the pedestal scene is the five as gems arranged with a sixth in the middle
0why not save the sarg?
SCREW YOUR RULES I HAVE ACTUAL STRATEGIC THINKING
oh, dari, where you from dude?
Rafasde: What?
because he wanted to get shot
just random question :P
Revolver: Rebels to GOD TOO? HERETICS!
You lose accept it
I assume to allude that there is a sixth
8Looks like they got...
8*puts on sunglasses*
Hmm, that could be it
8fired
you're all in space.
11HIPSTER: YEEEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
I'm from the UK.
just die Hipster
0YEEEEAAAAAH
noooooooo!!!!
or the moon
lol
Revolver: REVOLVER used ULTRAMARE-INES!
Find a stronger source of magic to fight her!!!!
victory.
Rainbow says something about Everfree weather
brb
8so much hate, rainbro
I thought so, someone said before. where abouts dude? I'm south, Berkshire
Why would she banish her source of FOOD
<3
It seems logical that there were only five at the time, since yeah, otherwise Celestia would have had the power to undo NM
(@Hipster)
best acting evar! :D
0Let go of your hate
*sighs*
I live near Reading.
Also, I just noticed in the creation myth scene Celestia's hair turns blue the very scene after my banishment, I can only conclude that her role in raising both sun and moon gave her rainbow hair.
And how does she know who to banish?
nothing stops the other ponies from farming...
Something about not controlling or other stuff, I can't remember right now
0Just shoot her already
8DAT OVERACTING
0you had barely any screen time with her
We hide amongst the civilians
15 times dropped...
Nightmare_Moon: Oooh, that's a cool interpretation of it and a nice catch
ohoho, not far from me dude, I'm like one train stop from reading
Is Celestia really that big a tyrant?
o-o
She's a god
0<- bristol here
You can't decieve a god
Maybe we should put Spider's web in our movie lineup.
she sees all
She is more of a god in the sense of Roman mythology
ohai anoponymous, didn't realise you were UK too :D
0yep :3
Rafasde: I don't remember it being that they weren't controllable, rather, it was naturally occuring weather. I think we need to find the clip.
Where they can die, and be tricked and all that
Or if you're following fanfics, She ascended during her 1000year tenure
^^
/me spams Nick
eurobronies ftw
Can see read minds or have foresight
arc is sadface
isnt it already?
I still win.
lmao
She is like a roman or greek god, SHE CAN DIE AND IS NOT PERFECT
AVeryStarge: I'll watch the episode later to see that.
shame on you for where you were born :D
*Strange
:C
I believe it was bridle gossip?
She can't know who to banish
Yes
Great
No ponies on the TV in UK yet though. :(
:c
0and no merch
DARI, IN JULY
and when she banished Luna she had to use the elements of Harmony didn't she
Cartoon Network
july
PONIES
Then we take over the whole of the UK.
0No ponies here in Sweden either. Don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, though.
Earth ponies are banished to the moon, she sends all ponies on trains to be carefully examined
Well, luna is harder to banish
0and no 90% of custom pony merch
I'm so excited
There is POnys in Canada
one by one she banishes the few that hide
/me eats tins of spam
That works so well in real life
ponies on cartoon network?
yeah arti
8worst funeral speech ever
replied to it :3
cool
And I'm being dragged to dinner by supernatural forces, I'll rule your night later.
Ponies on cartoon network. In july.
>inb4 ww2
*sarcasm
and she waas my Fuck buddy
0 100 000 people died in 1 hour: nobody cares. One guy dies - throw a funeral
lolol
That never works in real life
Hitler wins with 6m casualties with that tactic
11RainbroDash: You mean the'yll actually have something GOOD to watch on CN?
that was also the only body they recovered lol
i don't have cable.
I like how in "The Sun is Tired" Celestia admits she only meant to lock her up for 1 year. That's headcanon for me.
6They didn't have the bodies for the others.
cn hasnt been good in forever
regular show
i use internet for everything.
Yes silver! for the first time in 9 years or so
>implying he did kill all the jews
12Ahh thanks!
0One dead person is a tradegy. a million dead is statistics. Don't remember who said that.
12Ok got it :>
0Stalin
0stalin
http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png
ohboy
Godwin
0So that's who
suddenly SS
But going on CN should get MLP the ratings it rightfully deserves.
Quit Stalinin
She died for their sins
Wait, are we comparing Celestia to Hitler?
He didn't get a chance to finish his business
That's awesome
well it will give MLP some fanbase in the UK at least
Apprently
DUnno
though im scared we'll get a bunch of screaming 10-year olds trying to join our chan
just praying for more brony exposure
lol texting
i use msn more than text :b
:B*
If left to it he probably would have done.
wouldent that not be a good thing
kinda
like with what arcesious said
What's stopping celestia?
Wasn't Hitler a no-no in daily?
0I prefer it to be private
0tbh all the fanbase we care about already got hooked up from the internet
He would never have killed all the jews man
yep im stopping that now.
It's just not possible
there are already 15 people already *shrugs*
0i dunno why people care about television at all
15 year olds**
Same with celestia, you can't find EVERY SINGLE PERSON EVER
i dont have a tv
Arc, the UK is a horribly place full of tryharding internet 'cool kids', so prepare for the most horrible few weeks of your life as ponies become 'cool' when it starts airing
calling it now
Or in this case EARTH PONY
0same
Ohai Arti
0i have a tv cable but no TV lolz
oh dear
my god
Back to P. Best unintentionally funny line of the movie.
Okay, I blinked and missed this, what's this about Hitlestia?
Commander Lemons, are we still at war? Over
just keep them out of /rp/
0so i dont even pay for tv licence
So why r were killing Earth ponies?
and i'll survive
I think I've won rafa
ponies being cool?
Ivan declared war
I win by banishing them to the moon.
Its when you put your guard down that we will strike
0Ponies are already cool
I don't like to base how you treat someone or think of someone on their age.
cool, but in an uncool way
to us yea
You may banish me, but my brothers will carry on the task
>with tiny numbers
0They could be and call me a hipster, I don't really want fags, faggin up mah pony.
They gots a bunch of noobs
but i mean cool as in
OH MY GOD IMMA WEAR PONIES BECAUSE I WANNA BE COOL
0ponies already suffer from getting into mainstream. (see fawx news)
Sir, I think that something wrong going on with me... I'm starting to think like an... Earth Pony!
kinda cool
like that
Cool
*moon banishes rafa*
i don't discriminate based on age.
wow it certainly didn't take long for the hate to take over, did it?
Guys what you think? http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png
Dude, Celestia can't just banish like that.
13I don't need to text that often because I'm usually able to just talk to people online xD
It take alot of power to do that anyways
0i wonder what took it so long
I think she can.
but i know from experience to expect the worst of anyone younger than 14
06^
[22:59] <Arcesious> though im scared we'll get a bunch of screaming 10-year olds trying to join our chan
I wonder what the ratio is to RPing as Unicorn/Pegasus/Earth Pony.
Alright then how about this
It's cold in here Ivan.
06but of course, everything has its use :p
im not a hypocrite
Celestia moon banishes you.
You may think to highly of your tyrant queen lemons
0nah, its not hate, I just couldn't think of a better word, I just prefer it to be obscure.
im speaking from experience
I doubt she has the power
>luna helps
Flammerrunner how r u going to breath?
Then mentor them in the way of ponies.
Why would Luna want all these shmucks on her moon?
While most 10-year olds on the internet are annoying, I've met several that were much more worthwhile to talk to than any of the other people claiming to be 16 and older (though I'm always sceptical).
True dat
11My consern is that we'll get a flood of 4chan-like kids into Ponychan that don't know the meaning of the words "nice", "Responsibility" or "Opinion"
she needs company
unfortunately, 10 year olds do have a high capability to follow crowds. and one quite popular crowd in the uk is the 'cool internet kids' who chill out on Reddit making rageface memes
mentor them to me more intelligent
see the black curve thing in the helmet?
they will maybe get into ponies.
if you look me in the back they're open
OMFG r pony getting moar cancerous
She's already back on earth/equestria
Everypony is welcome. Everypony is loved. Our sites have moderators to take care of bad behavior.
also now they'll respect her darned moon.
I know a few younger bronies who are fine as well, yes.
Just like people "respect" Alcatraz?
She can teleport us back
have you seen her all this season?
none of my friends even like ponies :(
Plus I still think you don't have the power, but if celestia does then why not luna?
but ponies brath from the front of there face dont they?
If she wanted to... what's saying shes on your side?
they think im some sort of manchild for watching the show h
But Luna is not in the moon...
*breath
I never stepped foot on reddit.
combustiblelemons: She's been alone for 1000 years. She went to the royal "companionship" chamber and Celestia can't get her out.
Banishment for a 1000 years
0I expected to see more bugs in this movie.
*hipsterface*
only my extremely annoying friend likes ponies
0I agree with RBD
That's what
And you are ignoring the issue
STOP THINKING LIKE AN EARTH PONY, YOU FOAL. Soryy. Had to do that.
*Sorry
But you have no use
jkjk
How do you know that Celestia CAN banish us all
06D:
0i dont have a facebook account, beat that :P
06<3
Those kinds of people would generally dismiss things like MLP as being 'beneath' them.
Special beam Cannon!!!!! * destory the Moon*
I don't even know our exact nubmers
me neither
From my experience most kids seem to start to mellow out and mature at about 16-17
0*hipsterglasses on*
Friendship
*numbers
11Misery: You say that like it's a bad thing.
!Espeon
Celestia is a Sun Goddess... of course she cans!
change your color back prince x3
14-15 they're usually okay too
^my point exactly
0atleast we might be able to say "I like ponies before they were cool and sold out"
11There's nothing wrong with keeping your inner child.
i suppose it isnt a bad thing lol
I don't have facebook, though I'm getting it because it make it easier to stay in touch with people who I'd otherwise lose contact with.
8dari is a mod, he aint gotta explain shit
I'm learning, Commander.
She needed teh elements to help her banish ONE PONY
If she can move the sun she can teleport ponies to the moon.
She needed the Elements to banish ONE GODDESS OF THE MOON.
11I don't give a damn if I'm 35 and in a bar, if Lion King starts playing on a TV, I'll sit there and watch it.
8good idea dari, thats the best way to use it
0white background is a little annoying tho
I fail to see how the show being more popular is bad. It means more income for the creators and more seasons for us to watch
Celestia's either a gambler or has some sort of omniscience given that she was banking on Twilight (read: introverted nerd) going and making exactly 5 friends in a 12 hour period.
Goddess provides resistance.
8dealwithit.jpg
There ... no moon for her to banish anypony to
0ofc, cos lion kind is awesome
(Okay wait it was closer to 24 but still)
And you honestly think she can banish millions upon millions of ponies?
i think its more of the idea of the fanbase being polluted
sorta
I'm not saying that staying in touch with your inner child is bad
Without even know where they are?
eeeeeyup
one by one bro
Don't you need a specific target for magic to work?
0its not so much it being popular, more fear for the chan for me anyway.
what are you guys talkin' about
Ivan, she can RAISE THE FRIGGIN' SUN. Of course!
/me flees
how hard can it be just find all no winged no horned pony there
8the day we start excluding people from our fanbase is the day we stop becoming special
i like what i like, i don't care if its main stream or not
VERY HARD
11The problem isn't that it'll be popular. The problem is that the fandom may attract the wrong kind of people.
Raise the Sun OOOOOR move the Earth. You choose.
We are scattered EVERYWHERE
Tests will be carried out
And we aren't just Earth Ponies only
exactly, like silverscreen said
i thought MLP was MS bullshit till i sat down and watched the first episode out of curiousity
I don't see why it matters though.
11Not that we'll purposely exclude anypony.
*sighs*
That's just our main rank
You are just earth ponies.
You get annoying people in every fandom.
Problem is she needs the elements of harmony, doesn't she? Aren't two of those held by earth ponies?
i never saw mlp as a show for little girls i just think its a great cartoon
We have a few, only a few, rebels from other races
Celestia controls the rest.
True true
not to cut in, but Dari has a point.
I'm not worried about the chan. The mods over there are great. Honestly I think there's a lot more diversity in this little fandom than we might think. There's nothing wrong with adding more
I just hope we don't labeled very badly
Controls?
Fimchan and /co/ seem to take care of most of the less preferrable kinds of bronies at least
but the elements are incomplete
yep
11But like I said, I don't want any 4chan douchebags coming in and being all "I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG MY PONIES ARE BETTER AND YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING AGAINST, 'CAUSE THEN I'LL TROLL YOU, RAAAAAAAAAAGH!"
mind control
Barry this is an open discussion, please feel free to get stuck in :P
As in mind-control?
Prove it
0i first discovered MLP when watched g4, so i had no bias at all
how else does she enable harmony across the land
you still need to and I destoryed the moon
16 times dropped from the broadcast, lul.
Benevolence and wisdom?
@Silver, i hate that whole 'LOL IM TROLING AND THE INTERNET CANT STOP ME CUS IM TROLLING LOL'
I first discovered it online
Well for one thing WE ARE F*CKING REBELLING
when behaviours such as stealing are seen in the show
My first episode was Pinkie Keen, in fact
8who cares what we get labeled as?
erego you can't uprise
^
you are all celestia's mindslaves ^_^
11I don't care for the hugbox label
I don't think that's logically sound
At all
Personally, I think if we get hung up on who the "real" fans are we're going to just destroy the community with drama
._.
People you don't know or care about label you. notasinglefuck.jpg
let whoever is into ponies join, I say
inb4 Bitch ponies from Call of Cutie
I don't mind the hugbox thing
The worse we get labelled, the less likely my friends will consent to try and accept the show and watch it with me :/
i give everyone hugs
Here's to 20 million page views before Season 2
>_>
regardless of what generation they started in
ikr
YEAH
/me yawn
20 MIL
20m is too easy
Lemons, why Celestia would be on our side?
Okay, back to war
8exactly, dari
0one of reasons i started watching MLP is because if of how badly labeled it was on MLP
they're really concerned about what everyone thinks, I'm only really concerned about what they think tbh :P
/me 13also yawns
50m is a challenge
i don't care about labeling or what people think of me, im me thats all
13;;
0just to piss people off
Indeed.
Evening how is the lag tonight?
because she's a pegasi?
proceed on mission
11It's when people start getting derogatory about it like calling all of us coltcuddlers and crap like that.
No... she's an Alicorn
She is an Alicorn
yeye^
8sathi: about the same
and its her job to make harmony across the lands?
the show is good, that why you are a fan
yea
so she has to stop war
And pegasi are puppets to the unicorn
aww any idea what's causing it?
8yeah
so she must win
sadistic fun time here :D
8its because its blu-ray quality
11Sathi: It's because of the vid's quality
Love and tolerate the shit out of them, then
Silverscreen: I couldn't care less that they think that though.
06Yay :3
Ivan, sorry but Pegasi are not.
8and we think sprinkles might have a bandwidth cap
Who's to say she just won't kill both our races and leave the Unicorn?
Ah I see
It does have lag, but I'm not sure anyone is watching it anyway.
After all if she wants harmony, just get rid of both problems no?
8SECRET BRAIN FUN
we're too awesome to be culled
who says she'll kill us all
Unicorns aren't doing anything
Seems to me that if you want a race to be your "puppets", you don't give them strategic race-only bases that would require significant magics to even attempt infiltration
i don't care what people think of me...
Who says she'll kill US all?
earth and pegasi
13Since I have nothing better to do, I'm gonna find a looooong quiz to do on dA to entertain me for a while |D
NOmNOMNOMONOMONOMNOMONMONOM
why would she kill them both.
6I don't think it's a bandwidth cap.
0*siiiiip*
6Because the lagging is on my end.
0Delicious brain, you must drink it.
Why not? She needs harmony and we are both fighting
06Good luck :P
Who says that Celestia will have only one side at the battlefield?
BRAINBUG WINS FATALITY
*help
12DA has quizzes?
^its hr job to make harmony in equestria
So I wonder how long it'll be before we hit 1 billion pageviews. :3
0The Knife was ultimatly effective.
6THE WINGEST BONER
She'll be neutral, or kill EVERY FIGHTING PONY, in my opinion.
a long time b- man
LOL so true about the knife
EXACTLY
BOLD AND CAPSLOCK: NO
Wait...They have a plan?! Does not compute!*brain implodes*
She has to do something
13Journal quizzes :3
I already know I'm rather eccentric anyhow.
Orders of magnitude dude
xD
Even if you COULD get rid of us, she would only set her sights on you
13My journal is filled with them LOL
Sorry DJ.
0plans? Thats not how humans do things!
12Oh those!
why?
We're like 1.2% there already. :P
12I haven't done one in ages!
ah yes the lag beast is back
you're uprising
Hip fire FTW!!!
I finally did it
8JOHN RICO: SAVER OF HUMENS
12I'm gonna start a thread on TST for that >3
True, but you are also fighting
we're defending her
spray and pray
11where sound go?
0aiming is for sissies
I met giovanni in SS :)
13Well I just found one that's "202 things about yourself" LOL
12(jk) But if anyone wants to, go for it ovO
therefore she takes our side.
It seems that scenes of high actions are also full of lag
It's after all this that the seaponies rise to power, right?
06o.o
12LOL!
Who's to say she won't see you as a threat later?
action*
12Link, Angel?
12Pls?
Wait... the Earth ponies are attacking Celestia?
8not detective carter!
0inner censorship
13I haven't even read what the questions, I just picked the longest one I could find |D
...because we defended her....?
And the Pegasi are defending?
yea same as last night
eeyup
12Nick ffs I havent finished the game yet
12SPOILERS
look at the government, it is DOMINATED by Unicorns.
6AND THEN BLACK GUY DIED
yay lag
I just had an idea...
hahaha you sure?
i give lag hugs.
^ivan loses
First us, then the Pegasi
Oh... so of course she'll help the defending side!
in every way his uprising is flawed
so it will go away.
Dam he had only 2 days until retirement
What if Hasbro had a contest in which your OC pony gets animated into an episode?
11Darf14: You win an internet.
The Royal Guard is dominated by Pegasu, by the wat.
Woe?
as a background pony.....
Every way >implying that you beat me when it was just supplies
*way
I'm not a fan of OC B-man
ivan2294: I see that as a function of the unicorn tendency to intellectual pursuits, which always lends itself to aristrocracy through wealth and public position
8silver: its almost like parts of this movie are unnecessary
*pegasi
yes but you don't have celebi either >
I lol'd
*Wouldn't that be awesome

So really the race division is a byproduct
/me runs!

That'd make the pony semi-canon
13do eet
I keep hearing and reading about "an internet". What is "an internet"
13:P
I have no problem with the Pegasi, only the opresssing Unicorns
I'm not going to argue any more, I;ve won.
ok now I have celebi
>impling you won
Unicorns aren't oprissing
OK everybody time to take another planet
Won what?
It's just something people say.
*opressing
does anyone have a Kyogre frome HG to trade?
ah
0Damn it! Bart lived!
Meh I don't see a problem with unicorns
its another meme that everyone use
0it looks dirty
Besides, you only one because of your stupid OP Celestia
ITS AFRAIDDDDDDDDD
>mayor mare is an earth pony.
0too suggestive
8ITS AFRAIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I just wanted a regular war
So this is where the weasel thing comes in.
But you just HAD to pull the over-powered card on me
0FEAR US
Holy shit it AFRAID!!!!!!
:\ I can't tell if all y'all are having as much fun as me or actually fighting here.
nah, this is fun
sorry there avery
0did she get impaled?
she doesnt notice the whole in her shoulder anymore
hole*
Although it was more fun when we were on equal footing
why did they just fucking nuke the place?
*yawn*
Yep, that's pretty fun.
Okay. Just so long as it's all good natured ^_^
6Look! It's drill sargeant!
You beat them by nuking them from orbit.
0The adrenaline rush takes away the pain
or artillay fire or something like that?
heh don't worry it's almost over now
And now I leave. (P.S. Viva la Luna rebellion)
But I think that we're having a draw here, Commander Lemons
Penetraned
Oh wow. I just ate a chip that had a perfectly round circular hole in it
I think we have a flawless victory
The only trump card you have is Celestia, you must be pretty desperate to pull that one
CENSORED
The adrenaline rush is coupled by the most powerful pain killer in the world
>defeat one brainbug on one of the many bug controlled planets
12Looks awesome, I will start this at some point XD
>win war
The censor bar! IT DOES NOTHING!
nope.
Then prove it
0and we will break your hand!
Ivan, why are the Earth Ponies attacking the Princess, anyway?
As I explained you'd slowly die one by one in the forest
no your arm not your hand xD
wait wat
Not all earth ponies
for three more movies
and as I explained you'd slowly die in the desert
Just most
confusing ending
0The ending
0it means nothing!
there we go.
As I explained we have a supply system and orchards
Why are most of the Earth Ponies attacking?
well... that movie was okay.
OPRESSION FROM UNICORNS
not great though.
0Its so shitty
which run out and need water....
0notice THEY'LL win, not WE'LL win
Man, this movie just confuses me.
0the irony
propaganda war film
hehe it's a b movie for a reason
I love this movie. XD
Supply SYSTEM
So bad it's fun.
which we have in the skies bro.
oh gosh
Unicorns aren't opressing...
oh gosh
Its a good B movie in my book
0yay
11yay
WOO!
it made me laugh though out the time
YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS
Also, Deserts still have water
....yay....
BTW, Celestia is an Alicorn. Not an Unicorn.
i love this song!!!!!!
That's just propaganda Rafasde
*Inhaled deeply*.....yay
0yay yay yay
0yay~
8I I I I DONT DONT DONT DONT
which will run out...
But she leads the unicorns
0*volume up*
LOL anyone else got video/audio desync?
Yo
11ahhhhhh!
Water doesn't run out
max volume
...no, she leads all races....
11~*
it does.
11ahhhhhhhhhh~
And underground lakes are HUGE
Arcesious: I'll join you.
>and run out.
well be careful
Eventually, but then the rain happens
Now that's a cheer.
don't let it go over 12 decibels
Plus we also have the everfree
*pegasi control the skies.
over the desert.
No clouds get through
There are no clouds in the desert, true...
no rain.
My dad's probably wondering what the hell I'm doing. XD
We still have the everfree to provide water
desert earth ponies die.
Lemons = Pegasi both control AND generate new clouds.
lulz
exactly
Stupid =
11Tell him it's a special porno
*:
why, ponies of course!
D:
And we still have rebel bases and outposts hidden across equestria
0i still dont get the title though
What about the natrual clouds?
And we have a supply network
Because it's based on a song called "Avast your ass".
it's based off of a song
alright, i have a few more slots open for the D&D MLP campaign who wants to join
That's only in the everfree Nick
Pegasi controls all weather
yay~
11anoponymous: it's a parody of a song called Avast Your Ass
0ah
0i see
6It's slightly desynced because of the fact that I have to run sound through VAC, dari.
except over the everfree forest
0need to check it out
such an amazing parody
My dad said he'd watch an episode of MLP sometime.
it could cure cancer
8dari, awesome
Episode 4
so if we only water in designated areas where you aren't you die
niiice dari :D
best choice
SirSprinkles: Why bother running it through VAC?
for someone new.
You don't know where we are, aside from the desert
if you go into the everfree forest you have to constantly defend from monsters
btw arti about things to do in Newcastle, have you heard of the life museum?
And then I posted my idea for an OC pony to be animated into the show on the MLP FB page.
http://www.life.org.uk/
6Because otherwise you'd hear everything that goes into my mic. And I'm in a cafe.
This is a guerilla war, we are EVERYWHERE
Okay, quick question from one who hasn't been paying much attention...
8best episode to convert imo is fall weather friends
Oh, I don't have mics plugged in/turned on unless I'm using them.
please just surrender
I've been there lots of times now and its really cool, they have a 3D motion ride and upstairs games room thing
Earth pony should go to the Everfree forest to make a base
NEVAH
...what they hay started this war?
12Yes we walked past it
ask ivan.
12ovo
Hey, my cancer's gone.
6I am using mine.
I ACCUSE THE UNICORNS OF OPRESSING OTHER RACES
Which one was fall weather friends again?
And the pegasi are helping them
Ah.
what was the plot?
episode 13
well I remember it going in 18 it was nine pounds
8the one with the race
Commander Lemons, I require permision to retire.
oh
oh yeah. question time. Best episode to convert someone who would probably be skeptical and timid about watching MLP?
And your proof is...?
IRON PONY!
12WHAT!!!
i remember now
Permission granted
12No way, sorry
you've fought well rafa
Government is full of Unicorns
well if you ask me episode 4 is better
dragonshy or the one with trixie
12The younger lot arent gonna be able to afford that I'm sure
Thank you. Good luck and farewell.
*RD salutes
While we all work for them
for conversion.
12That really sucks >v>
*salutes back
yeah 9.95 now...
0I've converted with the pilot, Bridle Gossip and Swarm of the Century.
12-v-v-v-
11PINGAS!
*big boss smusic plays*
Luna: DReam mode?
i love this one
Twilight OBama
I see a lot of people say Party Of One.
okay then
so sprinkles you going to try to fix your sound or what, x3
AMMMMMMMMMMMMREIA FUCKYEAH
I'd go for Bridle Gossip
lol fail
I've been there too many times too to warrant that price I'm afriad
>slavery >dogs putting collar on rarity
You do know how guerilla wars work right?
yep
i starve you out of existance
lol amereia
That doesn't work
8party of one seems kind of girly to me though
Not in Guerilla wars
we survive in pegasi only or unicorn only areas
y'know I only realise aside from shops and bars there really isn't much to do in Newcastle
Tahts why you go to the everfree forest
thats why they should watch dragonshy
So I come home from work today
8fall weather friends reminds me of old cartoons
dragons are totally alpha and stuff
hmmm
and my rarity brushable is nowhere to be found
11I prefer Winter Wrap Up for conversion.
8NFL
where they get mauled by ursa majors
turns out my mom threw it away
Awwwww....
WHAT.
:(
They can't kill us all
what can earth ponies do about ursa majors
Nothing.
>zecore >immigrants
11porno = Rarity XD
I wonder why you can't find your Rarity brushable
Hmmmm
/me burns it
D:
And we live everywhere
hey twottle you there?
she is also a pegasi
11:D
I have this one too
0ah, love this one
No, no I'm not...
i dont even like the song in this one but the video was so well made
6This is by far my favorite PMV
:D
There you go, pull stuff out of your a$$
0classic, never gets old
Apart, the songs are all horrible...
lol
Please I just want a normal fight
together... amazing.
0true
You just want to fight, period.
I enjoy strategy and tactics
Just saying ive won this
BUt what about Love and Tolerence?
perhaps we could do the hancock again? since it'll not be sunday we'd have more time
:(
>all stuff is grown in CLOUDS
11This is a good vid. The editing is spot on.
You do win with celestia, but I want to see how far I can get
also there's the baltic art gallery like I said before
wait till the RBD parts
CLOUD cities are watered
Fairway Bunker has no need for love -or- tolerance!
What do you think I'm made of?
NOWHERE ELSE IS
We live everywhere
EVERY
WHERE
they're hilarious.
this vid i agree is epic, but I dislike the songs :P
You don't know where to water
earth ponies cant stand on clouds
yup
bye
And where to not
11Goes to prove: Ponies makes everything better.
Also, you work for the unicorns remember?
if i only water a cloud which earth ponies cant get to
then what?
agreed
0ayep
>twilight could make them stand on clouds
6The songs picked for the individual ponies are just perfect.
I think all unicorns could do the same
Twilight isn't that powerful
SPOILER: [secretmessage]That portal Chell shot onto the moon is what let Nightmare Moon out.[/secretmessage]
And not all unicorns are as powerful
Pinkie's section there was just too good.
lol flame
Heh, Flame
they can only use the magic to help with there speical talent
they help each other out?
Also, you are assuming that Celestia is will to starve innocents
*willing
Remember twilight helped the rest out
She isn't that powerfull
all earth ponies are fighting right?
Millions of unicorn live all over the place
Not all
Luna: Dream Mode next?
those that surrender we will allow back
ITS A GUERILLA WAR
pwease?
those that surrender we allow back
under containment in POW camps.
Would celestia really approve of that? I think not
Equestria is Earth in 30XX
I think so
how would you stop the unicorns from using magic?
That doesn't sound like harmony AT ALL
12I think I have some plans
6It's in the list.
and 30XX is the year Portal 2 takes place
ergo
Violent ponies dead = harmony
...
tell plz?
Portal 2 takes place in Ex-Earth
:3
awesomes
Equestria
called it
i had it in my mind this would be the next one
wait i don't have this one
link please?
BBL
6That image is creepy.. o.o
That's what makes this war difficult for you to win, you are ASSUMING Celestia would just stop supplying her people
6Along with ze music.. D:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1FE7yHGcAw&NR=1
12Art gallery is one, so thanks :> the others are anime stores, the shopping center, bowling alley for arcade games and lunch of course. But for the next day Im not sure
And move everyone onto clouds
...
Bro, you're uprising
I win
Where it will be overcrowded with terrible conditions
oh my god
besides i'm the tactician
this playing twice at once
it's really cool.
lol
it's pretty easy to expand cloud cities
Exactly, you don't choose what celestia does
just add clouds
this is way too cool.
i love this one its so good with rarity
Hmhmhm
YOU can't do anything beyond your own power
MEDIC!
both are out of sync
So I send all surrendering ponies into POW camps
but really cool sounding.
done.
6ZE EVIL!
hi ^^
Assuming Celestia would just listen to you is foolish

No, but she may not listen to your plan either.
lol

6SPAC! :D
6'
12Well Im really sorry but I gtg :(
sorry couldn't resist :3 but next day perhaps the metro centre?
awr ok :<
I think if it meant restoring peace it would
Besides, fake surrender
12Yeh thats what I was thinking but dunno yet :>
have a good night
and I'm giving them a chance
POW CAMPS
try playing two of this song at once
12Thanks, you too!
in different tabs
12Tlak to you about it tomorrow night
out of sync
you know what those are right
Breaking out, converting others.
it's amazing.
11I do it all the time.
...
I mean there really isn't a lot to do in newcastle like I said
ill try it now
Infiltration
they're on land
11awesome echo effect.
we're in the sky
Defective unicorn and pegasi
thanks speak to you tommorow too!
Someone give me an idea of what to draw...

GHOST RECON PONIES
Celestia mind control
wow this sounds
DRAW THOSE
cool
hello all

zsfdai8ouhj YES

So have I won?
Weird Al should be a brony.
Pony 2033 drawings
make it happen.
I got what I wanted
MUST BE DONE FLAME
6Shneeeeeeeeeeee
6Weird Al apparently commented about this video and said he liked it.
whats that ivan?
And that was to make you so desperate as to pull out Celestia again
...
he posted it on twitter i think :P
Someone drew a pony version of Weird Al
I have returned
I beat you until you HAD to use Celestia
sup lemons
besides i need a cover for the fan fic i'm writing
weird al confirmed for brony
hi cog
So good enough for me
^_^
12Sir, I do not want this
Yeah, but that doesn't make him a brony.
not really
idd :P
Right....
why would they defect ivan
give me one good reason.
6He will be assimilated.
6Why not dear sir?
11Feel Good, inc. :D
Because some will realize their opression
i wish this part was longer
i liek the idea of ghost recon ponies!
http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png :D
Not all are as cruel as you
BUT THEY'RE IN POWER
D:
Not all are as CRUEL AS YOU
12It's not space
Also, pegasi are not in pwoer
Gyro Bowl > Space
So they have even more reason
yep they are
6SPACEUS FTW
no, government is dominated by Unicorns
Why are they uprising by the way
-MAYOR MARE
The whole reason why we are rebelling is because of that
GOOD THING I'M NEARLY INDESTRUCTABLE
= EARTH PONY
6YOU ARE NOT.
>implying Mayors are important
12D:
yes they are
Also >implying that's enough proof
they get to decide how towns are built
If a war happens between Nightmare Moon (Luna turned back) and Celestia
they get to control their town
Yes please!
That is one, ONE POLITICIAN
damn i'm joining Nightmare Moon's side
ONE POLITICIAN IS NOT ENOUGH
Shame it did not get played yesterday
what's to say theres not more?
flawed bro
Nighttime forever, and we lose the sun's energy
completely flawed
There probably are, but NOT ENOUGH
Government is mostly Unicorn
says only you.

Yep?
7Oh, and the eye's uncoordinated with the other one, which is slightly open. O_o
So I told them gyro bowl was my God.
the skies are no longer under their control
7And now she's awake. :U
they're running out of resources
THEN WE WORSHIPPED
7Yeah, I think she is, Nick.

But we aren't a conventional army like Gaddaffi's troopes

yes cog?
stop feeding the parasprites
Only Derpy can spill her cheerios out of a gyro bowl.
alrighty then.
More like a terror group
I won this war about 30 minutes ago now
Also, Why am I a parasprite?
Only because of Celestia
6I have a list, adding to it as I go.
Which is good enough for me
did I say you were a parasprite, ivan2294?
6Interesting...
You implied it
o gosh this video..
And I'm assuming Lemons took it that way
GYRO HARD!
GYRO HARD!
how do you know? what gave you the implication that I implied anything?

Pegasi are best pony species
THe only trouble I really had was trying to get you to understand.
i downloaded the ponybeat album but it didnt have this song :(
Yes.
I actually like the metal part at the end of nightmare mode
Same here, you never seemed to understand
Sio i went nuclear.
You disgrace the gyro bowl.

Celestia = instant flawless victory anyways.

Mind = blown
0i know its THE song of filly's synchtube channel
Exactly, and my goal was to see how far until you pulled that card on me
We must find a official theme then
high pony casualties, not dealing with you properly...
indeed
/me 6looks it up out of curiosity.
High pony casualties is right
tuuuuune
-for your side
You wanted to banish us into space
lol
You included ALL EARTH PONIES
-for your side ^_^
0 deaths on our side
Not true
;3
We had some Pegasi and Unicorns amongst us
11MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
------Argument finishes here-----
mooooo
6I ish curious.. :3
6This song is so amazing it gives me goosebumps.
Look
Okay I got the last line so I don't care ^_^
Google chrome makes it so dang hard to download youtube videos...
i'm getting tired of explaining the same stuff over and over again
Same here
none of the addons work.
Just don't count on sleeping tonight
Are you all done being Fox News?
Your definition of flawless is different though
so I have to use a conversion site...
i tried chrome
Free: HUZZAH!
...BUT YOU KEEP BRINGING IT UP-
i like firefox so much better
Whatever...
its over free
Yeah
well of course. google owns youtube, they don't want chrome to support something that cripples their site's moneymaking ability :D
0BE A MARE
I would use firefox, but for some reason it wouldn't let me view the video on firefox.
6And I'm supposed to go pretty soon.. :P
6I switch between Chrome and Firefox on a regular basis.
but I prefer chrome anyway
at the moment
ARGUMENT = DEAD.
OKAY
bye guys
pony discussions resume.
/me 6is enjoying the music from one of the videos.
I go for whichever seems to be working best for me at the time
bye lurker
i like adblock on firefox
for some reason it doesnt work the same on chrome
Bye.
Hmmm

11Laggy lag! LAGGY LAG!!!

Does it bother you?
Ignores are like a giant blanket
giving me more time to improv a guitar backing
renewed / refreshed everything
but im forced to use it atm.

covering the other person
0restart!
0:<
>betterthanexpected.jpg
just' wonderin is all
Hah.
MKAY.
at least to ME it's not annoying
but if anyone else complains, take it off, k?
Alright.
HI
never really concentrated on the backing for this. DAT SLAP BASS
6Idk why but I'm kinda laughing even though I'm slightly creeped out.. o.o
Hmhmhmmm
11So...
So, anyone liek poniez?
0aw, it was skipping for me :<

O_O

pinkazid...
DJ PON-3 :P
0Ponthree apparently
0canon
RainBroDash! You have thwarted my schemes! But alas! I am to return very shortly and with greater force and malevolence!
6I'm weird.. o.o
;)
I could do with some popcorn right now blankflank ;_;
<3
cya later
11Anoponymous: It was Hasbro, not the show makers that did that.
Me too
So am I
you're like my evil nemesis now
honey roasted maybe
xDD
I have a huge box full of them downstairs
Full of bags
0oh well, we can only discover that in season 2
I've done nothing but watch crrepy stuff so far this summer >>
11So it can be a conflict of interest between the company and the creators.
oh boy
0if theyll introduce her again
That Topic has given me cancer
i really hope they do. she's my 2nd favourite background pony
0until that i'd consider it canon
/me passes around popcorn
the giant argument mongoose?
6Aaah..the joy of being weird.. ^^
11Who else here thought DJ Pon-3 was a colt? *raises hand*
D:
I give up
6My friend'd probably like this.. :P
*raises hand*
*hugs mongoose*
Send it...
I hadn't really considered her gender either way until I saw that she was female.
Oh, BlankFlank and His Popcorn.
If only it were that easy BlankFlankBrony
0i thought RD was a colt for a looooong time
sorry bro ^_^
0lime 3-4 episodes
Really?
Also, why such an insulting name?
I just thought she was female, she looks it
11seriously?
I knew from the start all the main 6 were female.
11I just figured she was a dyke.
Though loads of people seem to think RD is male for some reason.
Self-descriptive.
How old are you?
0i didnt do any research before watching =)
29
BlankFlank has no talent.
0so i was kinda clueless
Surely you must have your mark by now
Nor did I.
I just watched it.
*takes a hanfdful from blankflankbrony's popcorn bag*
fix'd
Kill it.
11The only research I did was seeing the endless fanart on FA and DA
That's not how you spell Videogames
Eh, I have some idea of what I'm good at, but I'm not sure what to do with my life. Hence...
11oh, and a few PMVs
6Slender Man may stalk you,﻿ but Chuck Norris stalks Slender Man. Wtf. xD
tried art?
Kill it with fire
6Oh,I will :P
i'd not seen anything
Hi
KILL EVERYTHING WITH FIRE
6Youtube, y u buffer?
Hello.
just went straight in
if all else fails, try manure shovelling after horses
0I started from /b/'s ponythreads, no not much info was around back at the time =)
I'm watching Adventure Time, lol Lumpy Space Princess.
ew /b/
brb
manure is suprisingly valuable
Never been on 4chan.
xD
LSP is like totally
11They're holding that pose for a while.
I thought Rainbow Dash was male at first.
OMG
lol
0see
Only Chuck Norris is that bad ass
oh ya on the fucking moon!
Adventure Time
It's alright by me
I always thought she was female. O_o
hmm...
So timothy are you ready for ADVENTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hey
6xD
wat
11THE F*CKING MOON!
*Not related to adventure time
-got back from london 2 hours ago by the way
xD
lol
i love the intro song xD
Hey lady
11***************
hey
Lady
Hey lady. Lady.
brb gonna go do some cooking
*whispers* Ponies
ivan2294: ENOUGH.
and put my chocolate in the fridge :3
nut lol
Okay
*but
Thankyou
11I love that Luna Gif
0way to memorise the date of the human landing on the moon
... why is your name not capitalized?
nut lol?
Who what now?
Zeke likes nuts ^_^
oh this one is awesome too
back
walnuts ftw
Peanuts, walnuts, hazelnuts ...
11I really hope they don't fuck up Luna's personality in Season Two.
i have... lets see... 56 pony PMVs saved now.
11She's my favorite outside of the Mane Cast.
Pistachio is where it be at b*tches
*brohoofs zeke*
But she has no personality to ruin yet? O_o
0yeah indeed Silverscreen
0actually I have a lot of concerns abour derpy too
Cashews?
I'm scared what they'll do to luna
Filburts?
Cashews are good
WAIT
meh.
0so with lyra and bonbon
I hope they don't call Derpy "Ditzy Doo".
WE GET DERAILED SO EASILY
She only had two lines so far. There's not much personality to get from that
eeeyup
Spelling Mistake = New topic
I don't really bother with fanmade stuff other than art.
6http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v323/vehura/Slender%20Man/SlenderMan05.jpg ftw. :P
lol
I roleplay Luna all the time so I already have expectations...
lol
wow...Psychoshy has gotten 20% creepier
olo
I'm allergic to pistachios D:
Sup AgnitioExMachina
Awwww...
Hi Agnitio
sup
A character that is a cross between Fluttershy and Twilight is my ideal idea of Luna's personality.
Meh.
11Arc: I know. :P
We were just talking about nuts
Exactly, it's a personality from fans. We'll see if Hasbro keeps to the fans, or if they generate an entirely new personality for her
Cool
eeyup
0I am almost certain canon representation of Derpy and Luna wont match fan's expectations. The only question is - how badly
I prefer pistachio all the way
surprisingly short story, zeke said nut lol instead of but lol
I don't think something so major should be decided by fans though.
0i hope it wont be too bad
oh boy
11Anoponymous: thus my statement: I hope they don't fuck them up too much.
Things like that tend to end badly.
Kill it.
Nice story bro
and thus this topic was born
this has been done too?
YOU HAVE TO SPELL IT RIGHT
IT'S SPELLED SPIKE
anyone seen the pokemon pony pmv yet?
*derailed*
BE
BEE
crap, it cut it off!
Bees discuss

Yeah.
gah!

BEEEES
THE BEES! NO NOT THE BEES ARRGH GOD THEY'RE IN MY EYES
6Idk why but I always feel bad when I close the cleverbot tab and I've been talking to it..
topic overflow
Bees? Birds and bees and appletrees, and hot nuts?
0not screwing anything and fueling fandom for more theories and ideas
6It is him..
I'M COVERED IN BEES
And that is how you start a new topic
^_^
are you ready for the summer
How'd it get burned?
Are we sure we're in the right room for this topic?
are you ready for the birds and bees

4We don't have any new mail, Silver
It's just brony
6Beef.
female bronies = fillies.

okay seriously, what should be the female name for brony? Filly is too common in the show
brony is gender neutral
yep
oh yeah, Filly
Eh. I put a post in Daily /oat/ about it, that's why I asked.
Bro implies male
They used it in Equestria Girls
srony
lol
It is, they mentioned bronies and fillies in Equestria Girls.
Sisny

Name's already in use? You've gotta be kidding me.
SMELL?
11KHAAAAAAAAAAN!

I might set up an IRC network sometime just for the enjoyment I anticipate experiencing from said activity.
"Fillies'
I guess filly = girls
well they own their own houses ivan
11BAAAWWWWS!

Learn to slang, bitchoy
Yet pinkie is refering to herself

Perfect timing.
XD
dang skype
filly = female pony
and her friends
foal = young pony
bronies is for male and female ADULTS

Ghost Recon finished installing a while ago
So I shouldn't be on here.
...
APPLES
6KILLER SKYPE
bye
6*icypoke*
okay big last question, no one else for the D&D campaign?
11What was that PMV called?
2033 ponies anywhere on the internet yet?
6Which one?
6The last one?
the mane six have been described as mares before.
11The one with the apples.
that game = most underrated one ever.
11Yeah.
12Wb
2011 the year of the Pony
And Faust has confirmed they're basically young adults.
6Friendship is Randomness
wb kosovo
Anypony have any ideas for bonuses/penalties for Pony Classes for D&D?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo
Metro whut?
Oh, gee. -_-
Lemons
i've been asking the same
It's pretty fucking awesome, I must say.
13Just gave my dad his Father's Day gift :P
METRO 2033
IS AWESOME
13Just after midnight, 'cause that's how I roll
= most underrated game ever released.
i'm writing a crossover fanfic about it
lol
See, I was thinking more like EPs get a bonus feat
It has an AWESOME plot.
12Ah, what did you give him?
thanks nick and nightsead :)
Unicorns get higher intelligence
derpderpderpderp
And Pegasi get higher dexterity.
13A big box of chocolates xD
Original content for AMVs or GTFO

Anyway, relink for spam's sake: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo and I'm off to a birthday party.
12Box of chocolates are always good :3
11lol
guys, ponies
well, you do love your dad, so i guess its appropriate XD
You guys know any good free emulators?
2 anomalies collide to create a portal to equestria maybe
I want to emulate me playing some old games
we need to pony
I mean recorders
w.e.
PC games
Yeah, gonna type up a D&D mod for Equestria Campaigns; care or not.
where the mutants go through
so I've been experimenting with MLP design...
is equestria doomed?
...I've come to the conclusion...
11SWEET!
which is cog?
...that Humans cannot be drawn in the same way that the Ponies and other critters are drawn...
LO.
11no one man should have all that powah
...they get too creepy looking...
/me is sending his Dad a prom picture XD;
Uncanny Vally, huh?
TRY HARDER
*Valley
It's called Uncanny Valley, actually
eeeyup
12derp
Uncanny Valley TO THE MAX
huh?
After the Nightmare Moon / Celestia war, "The Fire" started
well, not the max
11So...is everypony just silently watching this?
whats uncanny valley?
but pretty far down there
making everyone live in the newly made metro stations
yes
I am
Yes
6I'm attempting to not get RAEPed by Skype sounds.
Google it
I've been browsing ponychan and ponibooru, sorry.
13I don't have any pictures from my prom LOL
11Kinda kills the purpose of a chat, doesn't it?
03I didn't go to my prom
03:D
The uncanny valley is an inverted bell-curve, where the more realisitc something is, the more creepy it gets
13mainly because I refused to have pictures taken of me |D
ahh
but of course, it comes back up further along the curve
0possibly ^_^
I did, but only because I had to do so for my ASB
The more realistic yet obviously fake it is
about it
<Lightning_Quickhoof> See, I was thinking more like E
wait
dean't man tha
the creepier
03ASB?
damn it mIRC
quite
i click something and it copies
associate student body
0jus checking eqd
03wtf is that
0oc drawfriend post....
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt2uuz8n6aA
there
so that when you get to "Real Life" level of realistic, it seems normal
Lol
the people who plan events and stuff
0send it to the moon
11Cool.
was reading a thread
detail makes everything creepier
we must see real life ponies
what is this vid called
Full explaination: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley
not always, Lemons
Thanks, Blank
i'll be the treasurer for mine next year :B
well the more you add the creepier they become
11I myself was checking the Brony State Gmail account, of course, so I can't say too much. :P
...to an extent
/me has TVtropes bookmarked
0PONIES The Anthology
WKR?
03what grade are you in? o.o
:p
NO! no tvtropes
if you keep adding details, you'll eventually come out of the valley, just on the other side
that is my drugs
12834 grade
on the "Real Life" side
LoL, Tree Trunks from Adventure time in makeup.
thanks
or near to it
DAMMIT THEYRE THE SAME SONG
gonna be a senior next year
what?
6NOT THE BEES
I wonder what I could do with all the time I wasted on TVTropes.
NOTTHEBEEEES
LOL
Cleverbot's a she
MY EYEES
03your prom is for juniors too? o.o
11NOT THE BEEEEES!
lol
yep
Take over the world?
Likely.
you could have pressed this button
is that our stream motto?
11oh! do that "cage breakdown" Vid after this.
NOT THE BEEEES
for some schools around here it's sophomores too
oops
03weird
But anyways, I've come to the conclusion that Humans have little chance of ever appearing in the show in a way that remains consistant with the rest of the show's art style
lol
oh yes, the Cage breakdown!
i could have evolved with all that wasted time
11RainbroDash: Pretty much, until we actually watch the movie. XD
03here you have to be a senior or dating a senior
i think that will do it
11NOT THE BEES!
03but ew high school relationships anyway
11IN MY EYES!
lol
I never sign up for the lottery, because I'd crumble under the pressure of choosing a film
i hope humans never appear
haha
Fiddler: Does this mean that the time spent on TVtropes is the only thing keeping you from turning into a pony?
but I will for that film
from now on
si
11Awesome.
03I'm serious
so we can have turbo chat going NOT THE BEEEEEEES
that would be -sick-.
11My next choice for BMN will be Sapceballs. :D
:D
/me hides
11Oh god.
Good move
11the turbo chat there.
hahaha
eh, it could be interesting if it remains canon and completely 100% fictional and no where near any pre-conceived notions of humanity
classic
11It'll be so horrible.
xD
B movie ofc?
what point could humans have appearing in Equestria?
basically, you could have humanoid creatures, but they couldn't be Earth-Humans
Yay!
i'm downloading GIMP
add to the show...?
are we watching ytp now?
I don't know
it sure looks like it...
11Arc: no, it's a PMV
03I seriously hate Apple
03my friend wants me to put songs on his iPod
11It's better than YTP
03and it took me like 5 minutes
03to get it to work
what point could Ponies have in appearing on a screen in our everyday lives?
what is ytp?
11Youtube poop
Youtube Poop
To make it better.
oh
6If I ever get B movie, we're watching Hobgoblins.
03not to mention iTunes itself is a pile of crap
Some YTP is better than some PMVs though.
they reaffrim our humanity
that's besides the point
12Was it an old iPod?
03it's a Nano
asdasgjusiggG Silver imagine if we both won the lottery, and the A movie was the Wicker Man, B movie was Spaceballs
I rate things individually, not as a whole.
11XD
03the generation before they made it the size of a postage stamp
that night would be amazing
12Ew Nano
6You has no proof!
03ew ANY iPods
I want Derpy vision
11Applebloom knows of band camp.
0Spaceballs is a B movie?
0wut?
Not the bees!
11Spaceballs qualifies as either.
meh
6The Battle of Algiers for A movie.
:P
She told me herself
what's GIMP like?
so much skype noises rape :D
would like to see a nightmare on elm street on one of the nights x3
11Since it's a parody, it qualifies as a B movie. Since it's got a good budget, it qualifies as an A movie. :D
does it actually matter what movie you pick if you get to pick the A movie?
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
6It happens as soon as I go to type in here.
I think the only thing that puts me off looking it up is the name
0well, its one of the best star wars spoofs =)
it's like photoshop more crappy.
12iPod touch is spectacular though
oh
03no
03it's a pile of crap
btw i made this in Paint.NET, what you guys think? http://i53.tinypic.com/izmcmb.png
I have photoshop ^_^
03he has one of those too, it freezes just as much
really? csi?
6It told me that it was a he.
REALLY?
Not bad, Flame.
wow...
11It's the song itself, not CSI
She lied
thanks.
12I have one, almost never freezes o-o
6He did not.
I guess, if anything, having them there would add to our knowledge of what Equestria's like - does it cover the whole planet, and any other creatures like Griffons and the like just live there within it? or are there other lands ruled by other the creatures (humans-humaniod like creatures included)?
ew deathnote
11HE MUST PAY!
:<
it's better than those crappy OC characters seth posted up
03you got lucky
by a long shot
Wait, CSI what?
I still have yet to look at those
brb
As art, they're not bad.
11Who Are You is the theme song for CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

6xDDDDDD
Looks terrible .v.
PERVERT! *slaps*
Furry litte creatures seem to defy gravity.
Rev, if you can;t even walk down, without going back upo to just even comment among people who really want you to go dwonstairs..
I set mIRC to default. The text is what it's supposed to be, but ugh, that background.
Curse you Derpy!!
6Le pwn!
I am completely confused
King is the bestest mimiga ever.
Derpy is right
yes, she is...
lol!
Nope
Use a CRT or sunglasses when using a computer? :D
Can jump as high as a basketball goal without even trying.
...but even so...
Makes testing a lot more fun.
*Shows King*
Why would I do that if I can just make the background dark?
...Applejack is still the best
XD
*King just stares at camera*
King should have a game dedicated solely to himself.
6*icypokeofevilness*
Like Edgeworth
06Kind of slow yes ~
Yesh.
But that ruins everything else :<
I am behind this notion.
Rev...
COmeon
Then you'll want Windows to have black backrounds
or at least...she's the best of the canon...
d'awww
I'm active now, so why aren't.
CS is more important to me than RP.
It does. XD
CS?
They're shoing a show about kittens on Animal planet
Cave Story.
Oh yes! *rolls around rubbing my arms*
13Well, I'll probably go to sleep when you do
have fun with the topic war!
Then you're doing it wrong
-_-
:p
13Getting a bit tired myself xD
6May I also say that I'll hopefully add you quite soon. :3
Cave Story...
Why?
6D:
I personalized the crap out of my laptop. xD
What?
Is the most amazing platform game ever.
Set the text to black and profit, it's a great idea for everything to be black XD
EVER.
OF ALL TIME.
I couldn't read it, then. :P
/me 6pulls the poke away immediately.
IT ONLY CAME OUT IN 2005.
Get portal 2
OH, Ihirda, if you dislike bright...just turn off the computer, all problems solved!
/me FLEES
And you're talking aobut it in a PONy board..
6Ze PS3
of ALL of the ponies, though, canon AND fanon....? I'd have to say that [----] is the best pony ever...
AND THEY HAVE ALREADY SCREWED IT OVER WITH A WII VERSION.
I guess i won the topic war!
13Genius advice
LMFAO
Like Starfox COmmand?
Dont follow that advice
:
:P*
yeah
That was fast.
Screwed over some of the SF stuff
Not at all, I have everything set to dark colours. o:
6What's it like?
Well complainers need my advice to set them on the right track ;p
add a few hundred lamps aimed right at your eyes :B
Granted, the Wii version's MUSIC only sucked, and you can fix that, but still.
then the colors will actually seem darker by comparison :D
CPU version's still free.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BEIt0L43V4&feature=related
3DS version is coming.
02lmfao.
/me is watching Tanled
I love the final cave
More then I love hell
Tangled
Pretty damn fun and funny
My right eye is very sensitive to light outside, so I actually have to close it when wear glasses sometimes ;P
I set mIRC to default, then just changed a few things. Now text colour's what it should be.
6:O
There we go!
But isn't the white text too bright :<
Sellin' hidden blades in EAD
/me 6looks it up on YT
No, the text is grey.
Much better XD
:O
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9aG2qU9okk
Oh yeah, back to this fanfic I'm writing...
Y u dun liek monochrome
... cog
srs?
wat?
Hello HML
11GEEEET OOOOUUUUT
That'd defeat the purpose.
Hay guys
Hey.
That properly scared me as a kid
...
?
Final Cave is much better than hell.
Derp
And there's Bazul, the clueless guy about Mother 3...
wtc, Derpy?
Good god, hell.
/me sets Ihrida's laptop to 1 bit colour
hey, I have a right to be clueless
He does.
D:
*derp*
Derpy, you are SO random!
:)
11So that was a season finale?
Hii
I have all the settings just right. No touchy.
Besides, everything I told him, he never got the reference..
0,1Whee
Derpy, you are SO oatmeal!
Now set 0 = White and 1= Black
x.x
excuse me as I google it for a second time
/me OATMEAL le gasp
This way, everything should be white and black ;3
/me le gasp le gasp
That'd be so boring. .___.
ohhh, I know the game
i think i forgot to google it the first time, and then forgot that I forgot
Well it stops all the brightness ;o
/me yawns softly
lol
13Lowering the brightness of the screen itself works fine too
Or something, pink is much brighter than white :p
I have dark colours. I don't need all black. XD
White looks brighter to me.
I misread a "I hate dark colours"
I feel accidentallied
/me feels sleepy
/me is speechless*
I
You
WHAT?!?
Then see a eye specialist, you need help!@
will be back after movie see ya
I have contacts
enjoy
Yellow is the worst
I see an eye specialist often.
Yay.
yet I must watch my batman animated series dvd!
O.o
lol
Rev, ready to come back down?
soooooooo, what do you guys think of the Pixelart post? :3
Contacts are tacky
13Laser eye surgery, do eet
Glasses FTW
6A very minor case of serious brain damage? o.o
Beast, that's what.
I'm too young.

My eyes aren't ready for lasik.
I love that part
lol fail
okay, there we go
o hai there Vividkinz
6I must say..It does look quite interesting.. :3
...
They haven't stopped changing.
13I wouldn't get laser eyes surgery myself
Hi bazul P:
13paranoid they'd go wrong |D
haha look at their hair
I'd be nice to play witha friend
He didn't post the link to the map though :(
which was kinda the main thing
I would, if I could without fear :P
I'm paranoid it'll hurt
but I asked again
Me too, but I'm doing it anyways. XD
The pixelart looks impressive... too bad I've never played MC.
13My cousin had it and apparently it doesn't hurt at all
*salutes* Heil CogWeaver!
okay, ONE last change...
you should :3
OKAY!
okay, we're DONE
13they put something on your eyes that numbs it
LEAVE IT
OATMEAL!
Which is why I dislike contacts, too dangers to be stuffing things in your eye :x
6:3
/me le gasp
*dangerous
my dad had it
:o
:3
Nice
/me le gasp le gasp
6I like how the room's falling apart :O
he said it was not nearly as scary as people made it out to be
[/legasp]
/me le muffin
How did it go?
What's dangerous about contacts? XD
oh god...
6This came out last year,right?
13you DO have to be fully awake during the whole procedure though :P
Derpy, you are le oatmeal
true
13and you apparently see everything they do xD
Hmm...eye scratching, infections..cleaning, hard lenses
but my dad is like the most fidgety person ever so XD
Replacing them all the time :P
WHOO!
Came out in april
C'est amusant!
11I actually hate Kenan's hairstyle like this. :|
Hard lenses like
lol, I wanna see Fire's reaction to that...
Rev...
Don't exist anymore.
"Derpy is oatmeal...WTF?!?"
Hard as in old contacts
I have been listening too Pinkie Pie's WHOO for FIFTEEN MINUTES!
FIFTEEN!
11Considering the movie we've recently watched, that's just creepy.
Which are very...uncomfortable :<
You're supposed to take them out every night, and put in a new pair every month.
13Ew contact lenses
Takes care of all problems. XD
ONE FIVE!
6Ok..Just want to know for price and shizzle :P
I can wear my glasses 24/7 and keep them forever/over 2 years
13what if you get something in your eye and you feel the need to rub your eye
FIVE MULTIPLIED BY THREE!
contacts are amazing
/me Le Came
lol wat
thank god I got that right
6people panic about them
6but
Nope.flv
SEVEN POINT FIVE MULTIPLIED BY TWO!
6they're not bad
$60 here
I've had a cyst on my eye from them. Not because the contacts sucks, but because I slept in them.
13I daren't try them, I hate putting things in my eyes ;;
6it's the first week that's torture
You should panic more ;D
contacts sound uncomfortable
ah
Pff, I rub my eyes all the time. xD
15
6I cried the first time
6Carp. >.<
i pressed enter and then thought "wait.... that's wrong"
6but after that it was whatever
FIFTEEN!
6kind of like how diabetics can take shots like candy after a while
I had no problems at all, except getting the things in.
Totally worth it though
I'm gonna go ahead and shamelessly promote myself here: http://bloodisgood.org/minecraft/pony/#/-1408/64/128/-3
6weird analogy but yeh
Pfft, eyecysts from something that is supposed to help you see
NO, NOT FIFTY! FIFTEENokay we should stop using caps now...
Ironic XD
I have tiny eyes. x.x
6yeh I actually play with my contacts by rubbing my eyes
11Is this an auto playlist?
6and forcing them up into my eyelid and letting them slide back into place
Bad Bazul.
Or you could pirate it.
:P
we need suggestions on who to put in two of the corners
13Gah, I can't watch diabetics take shots at all x_x
6Wait,I'll look it up on some site
That sounds..disgusting
why so bad Bazul me?
6Meh.. :P
Because I said so. >:U
6my boyfriend is diabetic, so I have to leave the room when he takes shots
I got a cyst because I was doing it wrong, not because of the contacts themselves
11>.o
Then taking their blood suger >.>
Why is it disgusting? O_o
6I have a major needle phobia
:'( ok...
11god...that's...so accurate.
I slept in them for about 8 months and never hanged them.
6...
Arrrg
Same here
o.o
6YOU SLEPT IN THEM?
WAT
6LOL
*changed
FOOLS
13In fact just the thought of injecting yourself with a needle makes me feel uncomfortable .w.
I did. XD
6that's horrible
Now I don't, obviously.
6No auto playlist.
6yeh
Get glasses if you want to sleep with good vision
:P
6Just clicking whatever I see.
11ah.
Having an eye cyst scareds you out of that
6iI've slept in contact all of 3 times in the past 6 years
I can't wear glasses
dude...what's with the wall off in the distance? it looks baws
6 59 euros.. D:
Whynot?
O.,o
I have a pair
6and those were all at sleepovers when I forgot to bring my contact cases and solution
I can't wear them anymore
inflation of cash :D
Hmmmmm
6I have glasses, I refuse to wear them outside of my house
Get a new one?
I did
thats the Citadel
I wear my glasses all the time, lulz
02^
Everything looks wrong.
glasses are cool
13I have glasses now, I only wear them when I REALLY need to
Get a job... like I did... I hate my job... *sighs*
11Again...that's frighteningly accurate.
the Royal Citadel
i dont know why some people find them to be uncool :B
soon to contain temples to the Princesses
02Glasses 22/7 here,
or maybe I'm just that nerdy I dunno XD
13I get self-conscious about what I look like wearing them ^^;
Everything looks smaller and farther away, and I can't look sideways withoiut not being able to see
See, when I'm reading/using the laptop, I would like to have vision correction that I can take off in a instant
12[18:33] <Ihrida> Everything looks wrong. <-- Then you don't have the right ones ;x
I can't wear them.
I got new ones
I see...
6glasses are uncomfortable for me
I made sure my lenses are big, so no big issues :P
I should hope so
And when I complained, they gave me another pair
XD
oh god
6plus, I wear sunglasses A LOT
you should make a shrine to Lyra
Half-life 2 + MLP came to my mind
6Meh..So far I think to get PS3 with the two games I've chosen to get it's about 406 euros..Idk if I could get it yet -.-
Phoe commands it
I'm too sued to contacts to wear glasses now.
We saw Aurora, those pictures
Ville 17
*used
6and i refuse to get UV sensitive glasses
hmmmmmmmm, perhaps...
13Can't remember the last time I wore sunglasses |D
haha
but she will need a village of her own
I want a pair of UV Glasses LOL
13I just squint in sunlight and hope for the best LOL
6What other games do you have with multiplayer and stuff? :P
Well, just for my right eye
we have a lot of work to do right now though
You just delayed EP3 another day.
My glasses are UV sensetive. It was free.
EP3?
YAY.
our mane projects are this 65k block pixelart, the citadel and 4 giant 3d ponies
Wat
We have ponies. We'll survive.
02Wat.
Half life episode 3.
6I haven't given the job thing much thought..
ah
My glasses are like over 400$
13I could've gotten UV sensitive glasses if I wanted to
Marvel vs capcom 3 and tf war for cybertron
Half Life 2: Episode Three has been delayed another day!
Mine would have been if I didn't have awesome insurance.
13chose not to because I knew I'd hardly ever wear them anyway :B
i use to wear glasses for reading
They were only like, $100.
6I'm highly photosensitive unfortunately
Since I have a special pair, one lens is convex and the other is concave LOL
02I have a 50$ one. It has leasted over 3 years |D
6I can't drive without sunglasses
Pinkie Pie is angry that she has to delay the party too.
*BLINK*
*BLINK*
Awesome Ray :>
Long term glasses FTW
in fact from my last doctor's visit my doctor said i might need glasses
So every time you delay EP3, Pinkie gets angry.
I thought they said that EP3 wasn't gonna come out and they were gonna make a "new" game mixing the Apeture Science and Black Mesa stories?
D:
/me brofists HML
I wore glasses for.... 5 years. Then got contacts and can't go back. xD
not that i mind
I dunno
.
That would be soo awesome :)
6I want Kel's hat.
My glasses are are 2 years old
but its a big change from years and years of not needing them
The sequel to Ep2 is delayed.
Maybe 1.5yrs, I forgot already
02mine are over... I can't even remember xD
6Hmm
You forget they're there.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- *kicked*
My first pair is bad now, my eyes have gotten even worse from 3 yrs ago XD
I ruined so many pairs of glasses because I forgot I was wearing them at night....
Space huzzah.
I got into the shower with them on a few times... XD
Shame, but my current pair is silver frame with black arms :p
02I have had like 4 or 3 pairs of glasses
/me thinks about actually kicking Vividkinz for effect*
All three have great multiplayer
*Balrog besides the Space Core in space*
I've had 8.
hmm...
nah
Lawlwhat.
6:O
Despite all the time I spend on the computer my vision is still pretty much perfect.
12I've had 0 :D
2 so far, planning to keep it at 2 for another 2-3 years :P
02my eyesight changes often... for the worse ¬¬
Please.
Yeah
?
Hey y'all
please what?
sup
Glasses are epic, even if you don't need them ;D
Nm you?
11Yes, that is a nice hat.
My dad has better than 20/20 vision according to his eye doctor. He's on a computer all the time though, so by the end of the work week, his vision's blurry. xD
Noob question: What's the percentage sign next to certain people's username?
06Good night
nnnope
night
night ;3
:3
Night.
12Ah, I have 2 pairs of sunglasses
Well, honestly mvc3 is my least fav, but it's alright
%- half mod
It means they're of modship/adminship
How can you have better than 20/20? I thought 20/20 meant perfect vision?
02Lazor Surgery is even more EPIC
yes
@- full mod
12I just don't have the kind people need
Alrighty then.
11Worthy of Michael Jackson. XD
It is perfect vision, yes.
Shoot da whoop on your eyes XD
Shrap
6TF looks quite cool
He can see better than people with perfect vision. He can see reeaaaally far in other words. XD
Ohay vivid. You're here too?
Lucky
jsut in case you know
Surely that makes him long-sighted?
Hay Bazul :)
Transformers?yeah, love the multiplayer
Someone hilited me?
I can see far, but my eyes make it blurry all over XD
02W/o glasses I can barely see my hand xD
He's farsighted, yeah.
O hai Bazul sup
worship in advance = get out of jail free card
11o.o
The whole Minecraft server is here
lol, yeah
/me is nearsighted and farsighted, kinda
Which is why his vision's blurry from using computers.
6What?
we can be in two places at once
Or just plain astigmatic ;p
Yes, I am.

Vividkinz: ~ = chanowner, & = admin, @ = op, % = halfop, + = voiced

Revolver: Not that.
because I heard something about a sequel for the 3DS

Revolver: I can live with that. it's like Rarity's a troll.

why the hell would sticking gems on dresses make them awesome??!
I'm not a troll.

I'd rather save for years.
Rarity isn't a fail at life.
Fluttershy - Supercute!
Fluttershy is supercute.
agreed
02Btw Kosovo, Get a new Wii, Ike's sword and CP's fist need more blood.

But... I'm not... that cute... am I?
Wait for the Wii U

The new Nintendo console's cominbg out. </3
that sealed the deal for me
as in getting a new wii
still getting a wii u though
eventually
XD
02yay~
I hate when Nintendo releases a new system RIGHT AFTER I get the older one.
02Screw the 3DS I'll save for the Wii U
Yeah of course you are!
you DO know the new SSB game is going for both systems :P
02I know, but still
02xD
i think I'll go with the 3ds version
02...
I want a 3DS for OoT. Nothing else.
hey
02How do you dare?!
i like the portability D:
/me pulls his staff
Wii U > Wii > 3DS
there are a lot of games coming up for it that I am looking forward to
Sorry, but yeah
02Nah
;>
Oh my, I've talked too much on the IRC.
most of them no one knows about XD
Back to lurking.
Fluttershy
you're cute
02Wii U > 3DS ~ Wii
but i still ... uhmm... "like" Derpy.
N-no....
02And I killed the chat, I'm awesome
Nope
:P
Now go clean your scales
:P
HD Zelda <3
*blush*
02I haven't played a Zelda game >(
Hardcore gamers on a nintendo system <3
and honestly I am also getting a wii so I can play skyward sword
which is looking more and more awesome to me
Monster Hunter = <3
02Every time that I get my hands on one, SOMETHING happens to the console and/or the game
02MOSTER HUNTEEEER <333
I have Tri
02Ihrida, Do you play?
02sidusvkdn
monster hunter tri
how is it?
:B
But I don't have a PSP anyhmore
SO GOOD.
02HR?
EW PSP
Uhhhh
Kill it :<
Somewhere between 10 and 20
Have you played a PSP?
02mine is 14 or 16
02anyway.
02Let's play... now
Once, I laughed at how silly it was
.___.
i actually have a psp that I inherited from my dad
I used to make fun of the PSP
CDs, on a handheld
i've played like three games for it
HAHAHAAAH, no
Then I got one and sad faced at my ignorance.
and have like 11 I got on sale for super cheap XD
Never had a PSP, but from what I've seen they're the best handheld console.
Monster Hunter Freedom Unite was life changing
Now I need a new PSP for 3rd.
02I'm neutral at PSP's, Haven't played one. Won't jugde
Pfft, best at being slow XD
I have one
Pff
Mine was my fastest cconsole
tbh completely honest, DS>>>>PSP
PSP GO sucks, and the unhackable ones are terrible
....
You must have a crap PSP
*to be
Yeah
Gos are awful
no UMD drive.
AKA most PSPs now :P
UMD is terrible anyway
I have a DS, but to be honest compared with the PSP it seems pretty poor.
Like, the disks can get scratched and broken
If you're an idiot, yes.
I had a case for UMD's
XD
02XD
I still do, actually
I don't need a case for my carts :p
Me either
And I lsoe them
Often
its an impressive system for what it does
Why waste more money on a case? XD
And if they get wet, they break
Not exactly
the psp has its perks, i admit
02I would love to have a PSP (original), but over here they're rare and expensive
but when it comes to the sheer volume of the game library
I dropped quite a few games...that have dropped in water
boredom :(
If I want a Nintendo handheld game
the ds is the better system
They all still work XD
The DS is the way to go
If I wanted Final Fantasy or action
PSP
DSi XL is better
wtf that was unexpected
02DSlite is the best IMO
PSP actually ahd about the same am ount of games
3DS is the best :B
/me flees
Most just aren't largely publicised.
True.
I can't afford one, though.
XD
If you wanted a decent and cheap touchscreen with tons of games, and BC, get a DSlite :P
Lol.
hi again
DSLs are so cheap now, it's greagt
I never even use the touchscreen.
Hey.
*great
$99 I believe
Hello
new
And no, Rarity0, I will not take back what I said about RD
$99.00 now, yup
just decided to check back in
Neither do I, but it's still fun to play with :>
How much is a PSP?
I only said she was "not quite as awesome" in relation to AJ
About the same price, I believe
not that she wasn't awesome herself
12Ew PSP
but that AJ was still better
the game I play most often on my psp is lunar
I haven't had one for about 6 months
AJ is the best pony in the whole canon
130$
Mine broke
that's about it
but not the fanon...
lolol
Not $130
Unless you go for Go's
02DSi XL's and Dsi aren't easily hax-able. that's why I still love Dslite. And the funfact is that I have a DSi, lawl
and Go's suck
02[/late]
I saw them $120 half a year ago
> Not hackable > Slow UMDs > Thumb thingy
Silly thing really, and a sorta bad battery life :P
PSP's are hackable
02PSP, ARE easily haxable
Not the new ones
Or so I've heard LOL
Same battery life as DS'
02So true
UMD's are fast unless your PSP is crap
And new ones aren't hackable YET
lol
also, Twilight IS cute...but so are most of them. Twilight = Average
02So is the 3DS
And the DS isn't easily hackable?
UMDs will ALWAYS have loading times
We already said it was.
^
lol, an actual tree
02@Price, it is. But the DSi - DSi XL aren't
My UMD's loaded über quickly
It was about 3 seconds
Everything is easily hackable.
Well the DS loads in 0
Beat that ;p
Same load time as a DS cartridge
You just need good enough people to be bothered to try.
Ihrida, don't be silly
02Well, actualy my DSi takes from 3 to 8 secs to load a game
I'm not being.
XD
I actually had both.
And used them borh
02and that's due I'm playing games with a R4
Regularly
R4s are meh
/me speaks like a turret* HellooOOoo?
I'm never buying one :P
02(R4 with Wood Firmware ftw)
My DS Lite
(Silly Piracy)
Actually has a common defect
It's a white one, and the white ones had a problem with the hinge
http://www.gamespot.com/features/6159832/under-the-hood-psp-load-times/p-2.html
The screen doesn't stay up anymore.
How is everyone who is still present?
02Same my DSi, My L and R bottoms are almost broke. Most of DSi's L 'n' R Bottoms break =\
Yet again, My PSP loaded at the same speeds as a DS. XD
Maybe I just had an awesome one
Well you must have a modded one
I didn't
I used official firmware
where...did everypony go?
Actually, official firmware was the death of it.
gg\
What happened?
What?
I hadn't charged it in forever
just waching
See this is why Sony is stupid now
And I didn't plug it in
It was updating
And bam
XD
Ew Sony
My Warranty was done
7o.O
They went from here to The Outer Limits.
Good, it deserved to die :D
Not really
Ihrida: what happened?
Yeah really :>
Boomed?
My PSP was 10x better than any DS
And much better games.
The Outer Limits?
I am pretty sure that The Doctor was just outed as a mod on /meta/, but I can't tell if it's trolling
Sony used to be a good company
I don't know what happened to them
they got cheap.
/me was just shot
???
They failed with the PSP and PS3
I have an old Sony television set in my room, from >10 years ago
Fl-Fluttershy?!?
Never failed
The PSP and PS3 are great
lol again
They tried too hard after the PS2 :P
Just expensive
the psp...eh
Ihirda is a sony fanboy *cough*U
i mean like
Only the cable socket got loose and fell out once, but after a repair it was good as new
Not really. XD
like I said, it has its perks
and superior graphical power
I just like good things.
the ds has the superior library
and that's in the end what matters
Like I said earlier
Uhm... hey!
I don't even like Sony, nor do I have a PSP, but I still prefer it to the DS.
They have about the same amount of games
*Was not the culprit*
But the PSP's games weren't publicised
I run across games I never knew came out.
So the My Little Pony Facebook page acknowledged my idea...
Wait...
Hold on.
i am very familiar with the psp's better titles
Sony failed to advertise.
/me is dying
but the thing is, the good titles on the ds appeal to me a lot more than sony's do
what idea?
The only reason why the PSP sold...was due to the graphics lol
That's where the entire argument lies, really.
title appeal.
02You haven't played GoW right?
personal taste
and for me it's the ds, but I'm not saying the psp doesn't have its fair share of good games
/me is a useless bystander to these events
I prefer slightly less childish games, which the DS lacks greatly.
Hust a sec.
they have a few, but not many that appeal to me.
02That game is the definition of awesome. even though I have only played it like 4 times.
/me died
Who knows/cares?
*just
I perfer slightly less adult/violent/shooter games
:p
http://www.facebook.com/mylittlepony/posts/233802666637178?ref=notif&notif_t=feed_comment
I revived her, though...
That idea.
I personally don't like GoW
how did she die?
the ds has a LOT of rpgs
I revived her!
which I like
I only like a few series of RPG the DS carries
02true, DS RPG's are awesome (Valkyrie Profilee <333)
The DS has BC with the GBA :P
And the Wii lacks practically any RPG's
why is it backwards
Which has even more RPGs
Hey, I have a question.
If they make that a real contest, that'll be awesome.
that is true
The GB = <3
Also, there's a rainbow outside my window.
I have every model of Gameboy though.
What is it Fuzz?
I don't need a DS for Gameboy games, so I don't use it for Gameboy games.
the world ends with you is one of the ds's best games
Derpy, why are you always changing your nicks?
:/ My chat window is glitching.
4I'm too busy paying attention the crap that permeates /oat/
Once sec.
but thats the thing...it wasn't publicized enough
02GB <3333 GBC <33333333 GBA <3 GBA:SP </3
I have Final Fantasy III for the DS
6I heard so much about that game
i get bored....
6never played it
She's Derpy, I guess.
6kinda want to lol
it's awesome
to not do copy write things
in every way
right right, she's oatmeal
How do you pronounce "Lyra?" I would assume it's liar-uh, as that's how the instrument's name is pronounced, but I'm tempted to pronounce it leer-uh since it's a name...
6what was so awesome about it-
o
6k
ok then
thanks
sequel for the 3DS = <3
well
But yeah.
I could go on forever XDE
FF6 3DS plz
I think it'd be a cool contest.
-E
02Chrono Cross, I really need to play that game.
I pronounce it "Lie-Ruh"
idk
With the way Square is
but the story for one is really good, the soundtrack's awesome, and I'm a huge fan of the gameplay
Pretty sure it's with an "i" sound.
many said it was too complicated, but I found it pretty simple
FF6 will end up PSP only like the FFIV collection. This would irritate me.
and I HATE complicated and convoluted rpgs
Fairly Oddparents?
I loved this show when I was little!
I pronounced it lyra with the short I sound.
ff6 needs more love
ff4 gets all the attention
=/
It hasn't aired on Nick regularly since 2006. Ohh, and umm, hi!
FFIV gets no attention
hi
FFVII and FFX do
ff4 got a DS remake
It's on Nicktoons Network now
and a psp collection
and a wii ware sequel
The DS remake didn't have the sequal.
lol grinch
How do you get outed as a mod anyway? I thought they didn't tell anyone?
I doesn't get that channel.
The PSP collection has all of it.
and that is true @ the FFVII thing
I agree with Cog
I like FFVII
XD
I'm saying that FF4 has more attention
I don't like X
not which version of it is better
And I don't understand the lack of interest in VIII
I wonder if I'd ever have any reason to say it out loud anyway. I don't know any bronies IRL.
Ah. What about The Hub?
This show is super nostalgic for me. I watched it regularly from 2000-2006ish...when it stopped airing regularly.
I dislike VIII
and VII was very good
I watch MLP FiM on YouTube. Duh.
I've been trying to find a copy of VI Advance for so long. </3
FF7..never played
I pronounce it like "F-oh-ih-ss-th-ee-b-eh-ss-t-p-oh-n-ee"
ff6 advance <3
I should download the ISO or get it on Amazon
I bought a copy on this website and it was fake
FF6 SNES > FF6a
Spongebob Squarepants still airs regularly on Nickalodeon
I don't have a SNES
Veen over this.
*Been
ff6 advance has the better script
which I care more about than the music
Ah
which is still good anyway
I wish they'd release it on the VC
Not only is SBSP nostalgic for me, but I still like i---well, I like seasons 1-3.
same
I'd buy it instantly
I have I on the VC
if I still had my wii
I'd buy chrono trigger on the VC
Chat = DEAD
I like to catch Family Game Night on The Hub, too
it was weird, i think it was just !!RainbowDash trolling
Gotta go to work, no time to check it out, but just saw some random Pony stuff
I want it
http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2011/06/bt-comcast-mr-album/
My wallet's full of dust.
mmmmmmmmmk
/me attempts to revive chat
Did this already get posted? I didn't watch the video but it has ponies
...
The Doctor was talking about mod communications and wrote "we" instead of "they"
I am dumb. very very dumb.
Ponies.
Oh.
So like.
so people started saying he was secretly a mod
...I tried.
I did some kind of RP hours ago and decided to actually log the thing.
Who was I gonna play Tri wit, again?
Wouldn't the right thing be to tell Vicky the truth, that you don't want to be her friend, rather than making her WANT TO KILL YOU?
another I'd buy would be bit trip runner
mmk
then !!RainbowDash said "it's OK, you can tell them the truth" after he denied it
...And put it on a google docs document.
m....k
but now that a bit trip collection has been annouced for the 3ds I'm content
I like Bit Trip Fate
This rp involved um...
I can't afford a 3DS or I'd have no complaints. XD
Who heard Skype noises just now?
A bit op processing and handling.
XD
*of
I could get Link's Awakening DX again. <3
...
6I have my Skype on.
which reminds me, i need to download that
?
I'm trying my hardest not to say shipping yet I just did right there.
Was it Ray?
all that's on the GB VC for the 3DS right now is link's awakening DX, super mario land, alleyway, and radar mission i htink
Oh.
k...?
Hurray!
02Nickalert much?
so...
so far I've downloaded super mario land, and that lasted me like two hours XD
I figured you meant you had to edit it for language, since this is a PG chat room and all.
...how're you dumb..?
02Oh Chrono Cross.
Now I can't um....
I thought Hipster Brony was the stream runner/broadcaster person?
Ray
02And yes With me (@Ihrida)
ponies!
Were you the one who wanted to play Tri?
Oh
Okay
....?
I just plugged it in
XD
Because I actually LINKED THIS into the main chat.
Nah.
i wanna play tri eventually
He just sat there as Vicky died. Coolio.
Sprinkles does the Saturday stream.
sounds fun from what I've heard :B
wait...wut?
02Warning, my WINternetz may stop our plans
6And last night's stream.
6But usually it's DCD.
/me doesn't follow...*
02(aka: Disconnection every 10 secs)
I want to get a PS3 just for Monster Hunter 3rd HD
And now I went a couple steps up the creepy ladder.
I have no other interest in the PS3... xD
Well
Because I ended up creating shipping between kirby and pegasus.
The possible re-release of FFVII
I saw something about that recently
I need a stiff drink.
I lost interest in the PS3 when it lost its origional features
And to play my PSP's old PS1 games
Who's DCD?
6NewDCD
6He's the usual streamer.
6Posts in Green.
4DCD is our admin
...
...right
k then
4And usual streamer
Well, this did give me an idea. 20 questions?
woah i remember this
nah thanks
oh. okay.
(also, that was a question, so you're down to 19 :P )
I remember this so it must be from before Poof was born, as that's when regular reruns stopped, I think.
FFVII is actually quite good
That was all I used my PSP for in its later years
Hahaha
i just wish that all the attention it gets could go to ff6
FFVII, FFVIII, and FFTactics
Well now I feel like a loser AND I'm down one question.
I had planned on getting IX
? ? ? ? ? ?
eeyup!
And now you're down six more.
mah work here is DONE
/brick'd
FFVI is the best one... XD
yup
/me just got banished
Only problem is
It came out on the SNES
Palkia, Dialga, or Giratina?
if im right shes a fairy hunter..
Giratina
giratina
6palkia
6She is, IIRC
6no in all seriousness, giratina
6i just wanted to be diiferent :>
I was gonna say bad things about Palkia
But I thought you were serious
whooooo
ok, 4 Giratina, 1 palkia and one dialga xD
is this a survey? XD
/me shot
not exactly. Doing an even in Soul Silver
Gira
:3
lol yup
I had so many PS1 games on my PSP. I miss it... </3
lv. 1 Giratina FTW
:P
6I love palkia though
6giratina a bit more
Rawr?
lol
alright, I'm taking Giratina xD
tbh giratina was one of the only gen 4 legendaries that I liked
aside from shaymin and darkrai

the game was fail
7Well, at least you got your answer. :)
I almost threw my laptop over that game.
http://spikeroll.zxq.net/
7Not too bad if you play it normally. Excruciating if you're trying to get one specific eeveelution.
Why the hell would she do that?
What's her motivation?
Crocker wants to harness the power of fairies to rule the world.
I only have a laptop, so it was excruciating regardless.
[20:31:00] Mongoose|Postal2 kills fluttershy
/me cries
I luckily got what I wanted. XD
This girl just wants to KILL THEM.
haha
ikr^
...What's her motivation to KILL THEM?
7Ah.
7Everyone wants the Espeon. O_o
/me leaves, unloved
6because espeons <3
for obvious reasons
:P
I figured they'd have problems getting everyone their eeveelution.
everyboidy loves fluttershy
I love fluttershy...
She smells magic?
02No love for flareon
Does she smell friendship too?
I like Fluttershy.
/me is now dead
I think shes hardcore
6flareon is my least favorite
7Aw, it's floofy. :P
6jk, no leafeon is
/me performes CPR
7My least would probably be Vaporeon.
I hated Flareon in Gen I
oh no you don't
vaporeon <3
It carried over.
6^
She did not love me
6vaporeon <3
7If only it got Flare Blitz. D:
So I shot her in the head.
I like Vaporeon
XD
6...
...
6flareon doesn't learn flare blitz?
7Nope.avi
that was my eeveelution
It's boss

vaporeon <3
She broke my heart
I wish i was home

6wtf lol
6flare blitz + flareon's attack
i will make you wish that was all that was broken
Jordon Von Strangle is notified when someone finds out about the existence of fairies
6that should be obvious
6wth
8wow, i really should pay more attention to this chat
7Yeeeeeep.
Wasn't he notified?
7Poor Flareon, still doesn't get any good moves for 5 generations.
Oh dang
/me runs away
thats interesting
Not only is there an error with a character's motivations, but there's a GIANT continuity error.

He runs an internet forum.
ahahaha
I love Fluttershy
7Hmm.
Oh boy! Racist accent!

Oatmeal?!

I will flush you out!
6after all, fire type is one of those primarily sp attack types
7I just noticed Flareon's HG/SS sprite is the same pose as the Sugimori art. O_o
Can you show an older episode? Like a really early one?
Lets see if the next one has some more mistakes.
7Yep.
6it rarely works as attack
6I can.
6And I will.
Yay!
Thank you!
I swear the car that kills people is from an old film.

And it should be quite simple to take over your dimension. Stopping your nightsky will send all your scientists into a great big mess, panic will ensue in the streets when suddenly there's no sun. Oh sure the green houses will have light enough to grow food but prices will sky rocket

You're gonna nuke me? I find the notion of willingly destroying an eniter region for a single target entirely wasteful

Your Skype is so damn busy. O_o
bloody sprinkles
lol bloody sprinkles.
It has a dual boot with some netbook OS my friend put on it
So you'll probably be nuked a few times at once.
So it loads the menu to choose an OS
6Its because we're organizing a Pony D&D group.
Ponycraft next?
nightmare moon, SHAKE MY HAND

If you select either it will start loading it and then just shut off about 5 seconds in
oh, mods, what's our order for next week? is it Ponies -> Ponies -> A Movie -> B Movie (lol B movie, more like bed time)
6I have one other thing, then ponycraft.
Cool, cool
And at the same time, any collateral damage will be blamed on all countries firing causing the world to plunge into a nuclear war.
I can't even get the recovery console

So what happens if we just surrender?

Oh the simplicity of the design leading to such terrible destruction... It's amazing your species has survived as long as it has.
8so we dont have 2 movies in a row with no intermission

Ah.

I seez your point.
/me 12can't stop dsjbaksfg.bjs spazzing out @3@

8that would be a hell of a grind
/me is trying to think of other good fan-based pony vids.

YAY

You just shook the hoof of our future overlord. Through the internet at least.

i found this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNWR4j0aAl0&feature=related
the chance of an alien enemy attack earth is a great thing
I didn't really get into moonbase, but I tried it. Didn't do multiplayer, probably why.

Of course, he called my moon stupid, so... he deserves to die.

I can't speak from experience, but isn't the surface cold and boring rock as well?
lol
Did you spend your time moving the rocks to make your image visible from Equestria or was that more of a magical effect?
Rarity has more class than the girl who is singing this.
A crush on my sister? Please, she banished me to the moon. Would I destroy her now? Probably not, The elements are powerful stuff.
Those were craters, John.
The surface may be boring, but the sky was simply beautiful.

10Hi Newberry, long time no talk
Why i find Nightmare moon with a mustache attractive?
in fact why i find Nightmare Moon attractive?
Evil, powerful, manipulative?
All villians have this certain attractiveness about them.
Maybe celestia kept moving 'the sun' in the way to burn up the metors as they got close
All attractive traits.
14Yes, same to you
12Danny~
I used to use it back in my WoW days err'day, just sat grinding or PvPing and chattin'. Then I used it intermittently for raiding, but I quit WoW. Only time I've used it recently was to chat to some ponychan peeps who made a skype thread
This song uses the F-bomb a bit too much for my liking
04yes because nobody said anything before your entry, drf
nope
and hey
14I've been quite busy, but things have settled down a lot now
skype is nice to chat with people who don't want to use phone time
10What have you been up to?
ah nice
I've been busy too
10Oh

14I've been working on school applications and autiditons and then band then finals, then went out of town and it's been reallly busy :/
you guys
04LL will be consumed in her 3DS
Well technically, I'd need to be banished into the moon to prevent my powers from just wisking me back, it would certainly explain why I wouldn't be able to escape until the alinging of four specific stars some 1000 years later would be my only means of escaping
@rubenflonne yeah it makes those long drawn-out conversations a bit easier to do too. those ones which you usually have while doing something else

I watched it with Yaridovich
12depending on how Skyward Sword is, this may only happen one more time ;-;
and when there's the whole silence during the Books part
suddenly HUGE OBJECTION OUT OF NOWHERE
wait, why speculate. NMM, do you have meteor summoning abilities?
OBJECTION
xD
What's the address for mIRC for Mibbit?
For me to have been trapped on the surface would also have to mean I had been weakened to such a point that I was unable to return myself until 1000 years later with the aid of said stars.
So, there's nothing actually on the moon? No ancient ruins of unknown civilizations that existed eons ago?

04k :3
I wasn't a mage
04JUST LIKE LANCES IN MH3
"It's part of the game, if you don't like it, don't play"
CoB FTW
I'm always warrior or thief
See, all good people are from Finland.
04Mages are BA
11SECRET BUTT FUN!
The Dudesons, CoB. :P
But dude
Because I never rely on my team mates to keep them away
/me flutters
I know they're BA
12YOSHI!!!
Draogn age has nothing
04Even more so in DA2, but they got nerfed.
on Arcanum
But close combat they'll fucking kill me
listen it for half a hour
2o:
0end of story, no argument, we disagree on it. now then... huh, what am I watching?
8sorry, but Linkin Park stinks
8feel free to disagree
2hi Isukra~
EVERYTHING got nerfed in DA2
/me 4doesn't like Linkin Park
04So I chose warrior
4Sorry Silver : /
12hi soy sauce ^-^
04Which is AWESOME
11it's fine.
I remained Mage
11I like it. :)
/me 8brohoofs Ghosties
Dude Warrior got nerfed too
2ohh
2breeeeeeeeeee
2<:
/me huggles
because no dual wield
if everything got nerfed does that mean nothing changed :0
4*brohoof*
I had to go to Rogue
0that makes 3 of us
12lol
8Too mainstream
12i knew that'd give me away
No
04But the warrior is still better than the mage.
8manestream*
2LOL yeah
it means everything changed
0*double brohoof*
0is this dr horrible?
http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=xwyIR598a_s
!Isukra
04Just because he now deals so much friggin' damage
Yeah, everything changed
In a bad way
/me flees
6I like some of their stuff, but some of it is horrible.
Drake; Get Arcanum
I don't like it when people don't like things JUST because other people like them.
4But I don't hate Linkin Park for being "too mainstream." I just think it is bad music
That makes no sense to me.
6It's really hit or miss.
brbs
BU
^ is stuck in my head
0i don't like the music at all honestly
04eh?
0Linkin park that is
Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura
8i know ghosties, i dont hate them for that reason
Your computer can handle this without you pissing over your space
8i dont actually hate anything for being too manestream
04Why?
Well one
6The extra ingredient is SKYPE
what is this?
its one of the best RPGs that have existed
0YES!
8its just that most people dont like what i do
And its from the creators of the original fallout
8rubber scootaloo
with a story that gets you interested
4Well, I did think it was because of your hipster status :P
0It is a mixture of Lauren Faust awesomeness in one video
In RPGers oppion
04I'll pass. I'm saving up to get a small HD TV for outside.
0YES
/me 2floats about
0YES YES YES YES YES
04Then I can FINALLY SEE THE TEXT IN ME2
Upon release, Arcanum had mostly positive review scores, receiving two Editor's Choice Awards from IGN[5] and GameZone[7] with scores of 8.7 out of 10 and 90 out of 100, respectively.
wow
http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=7YC4Kz1rmY4 This one used to repeat on its own. :(
woot :)
SNOWY
Then they changed it.
So bored.
:D

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4OjDcDlzAw

0so much nostalgia!
I was pleasantly surprised that I could construct Molotov cocktail bombs from garbage. Insanely cool - Gamezone review
Niceeee!

IIRC there's yet another way of causing auto-loop on youtube now from the poster's side, but they still left the old way broken. :x
I keep repeating it over and over again, RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE~
its not totally updated yet
theres actually 13000 nodes
but its waiting to log them when they come online
you need only 1.2 GB
The Mission Impossible theme
its interesting how popular it is in china
The unthinkable has happened.
8honestly, i think its silly that anyone could dislike something just because a lot of other people like it
out of, what, your hundred?
Yea?
0mission pinkpossible
I like a shipfic
what? rainbow dash not in style?
oh
which
Rainbow Dash is always in style
Total Drama?
0meh, this show.... too much hype
besides, why don't you just have ME2 for PC?
0too many seasons
And she is always 20% more in-style than anyone else.
04o-o
Round 3.
04Because
Oh, soaring hearts
04My computer
04is shit
04and can't run anything
Well
And right now I'm just going WTF
do you have a mac?
Don't recognise the theme tune for this show.
WHY DO I LIKE A SHIPFIC
04It has difficulty running Spore on it's highest settings.
http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=xwyIR598a_s
04NO
Don't know
0ummmm
Ivan2294 cause shipfics can be just as good as regular fanfics.
0captain planet
04well
Captain Planet
04I do
Ivan2294 thats why.
bitch
And Europe
/me could not resist
Mac-bitch
04But my school gave it to me
2hi Kosoveon~
School-mac bitch?
True, but I don't like non-canon relations usually.
lame
Why would your school
macs suck
give you a computer?
04I use it for schoolwork and storing my anime, whereas I use my Windows for everything else.
It's troubling to think about Ivan, but apparently there are good ship-fics out there.
Hell, I was surprised that I like fanfiction at all.
Macs are only good for internet
0and Sir Sprinkles, with the power of skype
04For 'educational purposes'
I'MA GO
SEE YA'LL LATAH
United States - Armed Forces Europe, Middle East - Apo
The power is mine!
04Every student in out school gets one.
2bye Ihrida~
From that island south of Nigeria
WTH
Don't know
the power of heart and everybody else gets like super powers
School can afford to give free computers?
I worry that if I start to reaf fanfic I will have 0 free time
in Australia
*read
0worst. power. ever.
04Not free
right
04we have to pay in our school fees
John316 there are many better uses for youtuberepeat
Australia always gives out computers
You run out of it eventually.
:O
well
And also, don't worry.
0uhhhh...
0speed racer !
Oh don't worry about that John... you can stop when there aren't any more fics to read ;)
04Once we finished year 10, we get to keep ou laptops.
we have the free but shit
government laptops
Then it's just desperatly waiting for the incomplete ones to update.
If you are super picky like me you'll rarely ever read any
ahaha
Speed Racer!
Open the door
We just don't get computers, lawl.
Drake; and you're in..?
0easy one there :D
get on the floor
unless he can cause massive heart attack then were screwed
04We come from a catholic/private school so...
We have dells at our schools
04Year 10
I only ever read episode-like fics
lol
and everybody do the dinosaur
what fanfics are a must read?
no fucking wonder
Emmi!
Progress: Luna
private schools are shit for their computers
0I actually figured out before they said speed racer, but they said it before i posted...
14wow. Our school doesn't care if we have computers or not.
Or whatever the correct title is
04I've had this thing for 4 years
Friendship is....
I wonder how light pegasus has to be to walk on clouds
04And it still works and has 33GB left.
Luna vs X is the common term
Hi
Power Rangers
That's also a good one
But official is Progress.
You are a poor computer guy
Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
0oh hey, there was a kid and a monkey in your trunk i'm sure they're alri-- OH SWEET MOTHER OF GOD!
what GB did it originally have?
I greatly enjoyed Paradise.
14They dont even care if we live in a cave with no technology.
SHUT UP
0...
shit
Serious shit.
I have 217 GBs left
Also, if you want something that's good, but does not tamper with canon-content too much
04I dunno
Mongoose. Fallout: Equestria. Do it.
0MARTY!
Lower Deck Chronicles
04Based on what I have in my laptop atm, I'd say around 50-60GB
The first one, at least. The lack of set description and character action during dialogue is less noticeable in the first Progress one
and I have a VISTA
0 1.21 GIGAWATTS!
Kaboom!
now I'm superior to you
Alright
t-sar
a vista
an HP Vista
KABEWM!
I have meaning to read
is superior to you
it
04...since when did I care?
LOL VISTA
04I have a computer. It works. I am happy.
Speaking of Back to the Future... WHERES MY EPISODE 5 TELLTALE?!
It's short, sweet, and funny.
0derpy standby oh my god that's great
False happiness
You can't have ME2 for PC :P
04ok
rofl
I have vista too
I upgraded to 7
then went back
.-.
04I really don't care about having it for PC.
Why'd you go back?
04I have it on 360.
oop, laptop battery dieing. g2g
For my computer I stuck with XP.
bye
dat flank
don't those things have a ring of death?
Seriously though; just scan the archives. Most of the stuff on EqD is of decent quality, the 5 stars are a good read, and the 6s are pure gold.
Noo
Got Vista on another computer, it's stupid.
No*
Youtuberepeat should be used for good, not evil
all alone
Like so: http://www.youtuberepeat.com/watch/?v=CguoLKFKILU
people always assume that
luna's goodwill tour is likely my favourite, but unfinished
OHQI
but, the ring of death
ir really is excellent
soooooooooo alone
ohai :3
was mainly that first and second batch of xboxs
Is Goodwill tour still updating?
0wait a second... do I hear sonic music in the background? or is that me going crazy?
after that
and now they all fwee of it?
the xboxs were fine
The majority of them
I'm sure they're all good, but I prefer to keep MLP as MLP-ish as possible
of course theres always defects
But I hayed how PS3s can't play PS2 games anymore
*hated
ik
hrm.
2OHQI? o3o
I don't get that either
now I can't even play Hitman
I have to buy a ps3 sadly
Well then you'll hate Paradise.
So stuff like Fallout or Junior Speedsters Forever feel kinda out of place
;-;
hey just free
2and hi HML~
cuz
Sly 4
0oh god
nazi
lemme find the ones I like real quick
Get sly 1-3
I still have my PS2.
I have them
(:
Good
Played them all
I think goodwill is, there has just been a long delay
you are worthy
dammit dash
oooh, paradise was that "it's a dream" one, right?
Trust me, I can get into ANY story and be hooked instantly
except for the first
0the fact that I'm jewish makes me thank Rainbow dash right now
of Sly 4
well
WHAT
I have the first
That's why I rarely ever test stories
I don't like it
really
And Pinkie Pie
0yep
To see if I like them
It was sloppy
and Fluttershy
and animation poor
0hold on
but hey, it got better
2nd and 3rd were awesome
0there we go
hm.
2nd was its height
I can understand that Ivan...
hay guize
3rd..eh
0bunny census
3rd was short
And maybe even Mayor Mare
it also seemed forced

Hell, once my Middle School Librarian gave me a completely random book about an owl or something, and I read it allday
why is the panda a good guy?
yep
he was a villain in the first one
0.... bunnies reproduce at such a rate that they pretty much multiply
Indeed
And that movie Legend of the Guardians: The owls of Ga'hoole
i'm at the great wolf lodge and i swear this place should be marketed to furries :V
My middle school teacher gave me a bunch of random romance novels.
lol
I want to know what happens in sly 4 though
Was expecting the song.
0this is me at a sporting event
Lawl.
after sly lost his memory
I heard there was a book, and next thing I knew I had read all 15 books of the series
I was like
oh shit
lol
0except for that part
They can't finish the series like that
:O
the first trailer just made me think
cock block
just like Skyrim's
it pumps you up
but ultimately, it's a cock block
0brony hitler is top reccomended
before the real thing
I'm surprised I haven't started reading my other 2 Clancy books I have yet to read
OWLS
6Skype wins
My standards are too damn high. Most of the time I either don't like it, or it's good enough for me to give it a shot but reader fatigue sets in a little while later. I've got maybe 4 or 5 fics that I really like, and that's it. :E

Jose Gonzalez is a good musician
Buffering
Skype is eating your bandwidth.
:P
0dangus internet. stop failing
...
nah
6Apparently
STFU SKYPE!
ahhhh, managed to watch 22 episodes of MLP with my friend, that should turn him brony in no time
0this may or may not be skype's fault... it can screw up internet connection
for me though
0in some cases
I can't wait for SSB4
Luigi's Mansion 2
That circle is Youtube buffering the video
and....
Pikmin 3
Space oddsey is pretty sweet.
0I know...
*oddyessey?
IDK HOW TO SPELL IT
0but Skype can do horrible things to internet connection
Why is Luigi's mansion getting a sequel?
There are so few fics out there with good set description and physical character interaction/description during dialogue. x_x
idk
oO
It's going to be for the 3ds
It looks win
0uhhhh...
Needs... something
MLP isn't a show about talking heads; ponies do stuff when they talk.
Reshiram?
Lugia?
Fluttershy?
odyssey*
Halsemon?
So, has anyone done Ghost Recon ponies in the few hours I've been gone?
Toripter?
0come on random knowledge of random things... you can figure this out
Thanks Retsamoreh

Indeed... what is this?
/me throws all of them in

No problemo.

Dr. Foal
Stop crying D<

Oo
Also, FYI Meat Boy is a boy without skin, so Meat Boy pony can work
Huzzah Super Meat Boy.
It's like me crying that Rome Total War would get a remake

Love that game.
sorry about that.
0lazytown... haha

Not. good. enough.
i don't know
pony yarn kirby
BAM
Although I would pay money to see that.
Darn
Kirby can be ponified... just get him to eat a pony.
0*shrugs* It would be nice to have a brony conversation without having to reload pages on ponychan
But he'll just gain the abilities and a hat
Not become one
......That's vaugly scary to think about.
Hmm.
M
K
yarn kirby turns into a pony
Ponies
MORTAL KOMBAT?
8too much talk = this chat on friday nights

God dammit i keep dying on OoT XD
Missing wat
And get scolded by Fluttershy.
oh excuse me
04XD
0gotta love aladdin though
Meat Boy can't because the squareness of his body cannot be imitated in ponyform well

Although he has hands
8dari, shame on you

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/
8its a fantastic movie

Most things that are ponified are humans anyways
0such a good moviea
but he has to know :P
0movie
8this means nopony ruin it for him!
Which means I still want GHOST RECON PONIES
Yoshi could probably convert easily to a spike-like creature, or vice versa...

Ponify F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon)
Those were great, awesome music to accompany then too
shit will get better someday, right? hehe
oh just one last thing i don't think i will be able to make it next week
04I could care less as long as the game plays the same way as it should >.>;
How to ponify that
FINALLY
SOMEONE KNOWS

bloody sklar, why not? :P
wait
How you know FEAR?
MAGIC
0:(
6I have no real worries about things. What doesn't kill me, etc.
Lawl, it does sound like chanting though.
I looked it up, but I know it stood for something
Loved the 2nd game
Just forgot what
Is the stream offline?
Bleagh. FEAR wasn't all that good a game.
be at my dads but i love him more than any movie
6Yes.
First Equine Assault Recon
4Final Elite enemy
6I'm leaving in a minute.
Well, you know. First horror game
Outline
Aww, oh well.
4Fury mode on it!!!
I remember the hype about it, never played it though
SHUT YOUR MOUTH
However I don't see how it's offensive.
i get you sklar, if I could choose to see my dad instead of being in the stream I would xD
Nightmare Moon, that's a win.
you're forgiven
Okay
;D
Hey, calling it like I saw it. Did not match the hype.
Yooooo
How about Tom Clancy HAWX
guys i'm tired
That also stands for something
can i snuggle twilight
others did >_>
I forgot what though
and Chime
Google
is your friend
I would be suprised if it WASNT edited
4Well it's nice that people are worried about you bro, and it's nice to see people care
alright bye also sklar is pretty much my user name everywhere so if you see it somewhere else chances are its me
high altitude warfare experimental (squadron)
anyway, gonna grab a drink and shtuff. if you're gone before I get back, peace out Sprinkles, see you later
HAWX Squadron
Ponify that
also thanks for love bye love you all
0okay sprinkles... try and see if you can figure a way to get money... I'm sure there's a place where you can work somewhere....
greetings, all
High Altitude Warmare Experimental Squadron?
Or is that too little
Also, Ponify BATTLEFIELD 3
Modern Warfare = Modern Warmare
i don't see the little
Hmm, I wonder if I could set up a system where you request videos and then they get streamed automatically.
6Mane problem really is the lack of ways to contact me. No money = no phone, and that's all any place bothers to do when contacting people.
Battlefriends 3
wait.
If I can work out how to make browser addons, probably. :o
that sounds stupid.
too little ponies
i think that's kinda the point
6dari: probably not a good idea
Cattlefield 3. It's a herding sim for AppleJack.
As in not enough pony
4Ever considered getting a PO Box, Sprinks?
Why?
6They wouldn't send me mail anyway, Ghosties.
Lol, Applejack playing farmville.
DOOM 3
Ponify it.
So no one else is going to stream?
Battlefield 3 is gonna be SO AWESOME
Well DCD could if he gets back.
not much in doom to work with
Rainbow dash will explode from the awesomeness
4Hm hes a hard one
6And because we'd have to set it up so the mods would have to approve the videos so we don't get the same video a million times/inappropriate videos, dari.
Even she cannot handle it
YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID
I remember when I used to stream.
04Muslim fundies probably went "It sounds like us praising Allah REMOVE IT."
OH
BOOM 3
ie sonic rainboom
4And then he died
What up, party ponies?
Apple BOOM 3
4All of them dead
No. Can't do that. Doom and Ponies just don't mix.
(Apple) Bloom 3
4Will this mean that you won't be able to mod and stream much longer, man?
Red Faction
Even trying makes my brain recoil in horror.
hey mine worked!
DO IT
Dead id good
Inappropriate videos on youtube?
6Oh, no, I'll be fine.
Maybe if you have them shooting friendship beams instead of bullets
One time, in a lucid dream, I spawned a bunch of locusts and made them eat an entire town's residents alive.
6I use a cafe wifi, remember?
Red Apple?
It was glorious.
:D
...
"I need a hug... a really, big hug!"
we all do
6I mean things we just generally don't want, dari.
I hope you never gain the powers to do that in RL retsa
Ok.
Geez retsa... your imagination is a disturbing place...
I was quoting Doom
Command and Conquer
Really? You guys must have really boring dreams.
no kidding
Nightboomfer... you can't quote Doom. There's no dialogue there.
No, just less horrifying dreams.
The Doom Comic I mean
It wasn't that horrifying.
Ahh.
YOU ARE HUGE
Ponify C&C
x.x
Retsa is an awful person.
And quake
In all honesty, I'm more afraid of washing machines than I am of giant hordes of locusts.
4I love wind
And Starcraft and Need for Speed and Burnout
6>>; /oat/ needs to move a bit faster so I can leave.
4Fun to knock everything off the edge
Omnious chanting != Muslim prayers
I'm not surprised though, and whoever made the song shouldn't be either.
Me too
YOU ARE HUGE, THAT MEANS YOU NEED A HUGE HUG! HUG AND CUDDLE... HUG AND CUDDLE... Here comes the Night Pony, choo cha cha BOOGIE!
And World of Warcraft, E.V.E. Online
Muslim Prayers != Evil
I'm sincerely scared for my life right now.
May I ask why?
Lol Night.
2LOL
It's called a joke.
People will complain about pretty much anything you do now.
You're making my think of Pinkie on a sugar rush with that.
Being in a country with a sizable Muslim population and receiving channels from a Muslim country, I have heard and see those a lot of times
And I know what they mean, more or less
NOTHING EVIL.
Ponify Portal
Pinkie is always on a sugar rush.
Portal alraedy has been
4 2 mana gems 2 armor and 9 Xp gems
See "Better living through science and ponies"
Half-life, Counter Strike, TF2, and Day of Defeat
/me hides\
4Thats all i need
THE TERROR OF THE BLACK HISTORY...
The name
Pony Fortress 2, easy.
And the others>
*?
Seriously, people are getting too sensitive.
Day of Banish, lol fail
Yeah, Leafeon
Half-pony, Counter Spike, Day of... Pony...?
Okay, I'm back for like, four minutes.
03people ARE too sensitive
Day of Banishment
Basically, Allh is Arabic for God
03it's like when people get butthurt over me saying I don't lik eApple
/me hides
Closeenough.jp
*Allah
"Hey Rainbow Dash, I found this neat sugar, it was all wrapped up in this nifty plastic bag and everything! It tastes funny but it makes me soooooo happy!" *snort* OOh, I got a nosebleed!
Pony Effect
:l
:l
Okay So how about Command and Conquer?
Wait, where?
So you don't care when people say that Weird Al sucks?
And ponify Starcraft and Warcraft
I shudder at the thought of ponies on crack.
As different names
Oh good god, another dimension.
ahh finally, i found the right chatroom
Pinkie Pie in the streets of NYC.
Pinkie Pie on cocaine... reality would collapse
Ponify C&C
Pinkie Pie on crack would ensue not only the destruction of our world, but the creation of an entire DIMENSION.
Don't be silly Games4me. Animated characters are hard-wired to avoid drugs.
OH I KNOW, PONIFY X-COM
OUR
DIMENSION.
is doomed?
Not all of them.
X-COM!
YEAH!
A pony dimension?
Any time they even see the things, they're forced to come to gether in a nonsensical PSA to denounce the things.
Only the ones made for kids.
You know that Kirby power when he eats a sparkly lollipop and the theme music gets like twice as fast? Yeah, that's what I think of when I imagine Pinkie on coke
No, our dimension.
X-Com: UFO Defense PONIFY THAT
I just get fed up with you saying it all the time.
lolz
Woops, brb
At least 5 times every single day "EWW APPLE".
also
Ivan, I'll do it.
Jsut the name
I LOVE that game.
And if Cartoon characters avoid drugs, explain Michaelangelo from the Ninja Turtles
/me Sits on LL
.-.
lol, I've never seen that show
_^
/me sits on LL as well :3
P-Com: UFP Party.
UFP stands for?
Unidentified flying Pinkie.
04nyaa
TOTEM POLE
Know what? PONIFY TETRIS.
a Flying Pinkie Party?
04XD
WE ARE DOOMED
How could it be unidentified, AND known to be pinkie?
Hell yeah.
Wait, but then you identified it
Lying Black Sheep, Sorrowful Virgin, Wounded Lion, Swaying Scales.
PONIFY TETRIS
YES DO IT
Outline: My point exactly.
Pony tetris = Kamasutra for ponies
/me 's brain explodes.
/me feeds it to Nyan Cat
Ponify Command and Conqure
MIND F- *RIMSHOT*
Or Dune 2
Or quake
I got it all
Need for Speed?
[1,0You0,4Tube]: Bronies Everywhere | by Doomwad765 | Length: | Views: 9,047 (135 likes, 7 dislikes, 4.09 Popularity)
Burnout?
Do you guys think Retsamoreh is better for a villian or protagonist name?
Well, burnout would be easy.
Burnout:Equestria
Also, that game would SUCK
Mario Kart would be better
/me gets ignored
Rainbow Dash Road
/me takes it back
Double Reading Rainbow Dash Road
Rainbow Dash already has a need for speed, so a Poniefied NFS would just be regular NFS, but you get to fly ponies.
Hi
Retsamoreth would be good for an Anti-Hero. Happy?
Can we possibly add anymore references to Double Reading Rainbow Dash Road
Couldn't say Retsa. It could go either way.
It's neutral enough that you're free to do what you want with the character.
03seriously the pony fad needs to die
Eh. I was just looking for some opinions on it. EVERYONE I've asked has said it goes both ways.
...Don't feed Retsa
^
03this is like the only place I know of that cares that much
Colt Recon: Advance Foalfighter 2
^
03none of the other IRC networks, nobody I know IRL, nothing
Rainbow Six?
03I don't care if you like it, just stop making it a fad kthxbai
All of my other IRC networks have bronies on it.
Who said I was trolling? I was actually looking for opinions on it.
Hi
lol
And all my other forums.
03then you need to find new networks.
End war? Splinter Cell? HAWX?
^
Or make a channel and keep it there
not here please
We need to ponify all of these
03that too
Almost every name is neutral. You can turn it in any direction.
Pony Hawk's Equestrian Wasteland
All I'm saying is... this is a pony chat
Lawl, you guys enjoy complaining.
lol
Good one night
Not really.
PONY HAWK
YES
THAT NEEDS TO BE A FANFIC
How can you ponify ENDWAR
But then again Drf is a mod so he can do what he bloody pleases
XD
Hmmm
/me flees
Tom Clancy names are hard to ponify aren't they.
yup
Rainbow Dash 6
/me shrug
What.
The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Dead or Alive, Sum of All Fears, The Bear and The Dragon.
Goldfinger
Ponify that
Coltfinger
done
It's a james bond movie
ponies dont have fingers
Hunt for the Red October was ponified at some point. I forgot what it was called.
Ehh. We need more pony terms.
Goldhoof then
i though Goldhoov
hoof*
I just want a better name for Rainbow Six: Vegas 2
A lot of these pony conversions are starting to sound same-y... and that's not a good thing.
Ponified
Rainbow Dash: Ponyville 2
And that's why we derail it
Well this is some eventful silence. This is better than me posting MLP links, just nothing? Well that's stupid.
So, anyone play Ghost Recon?
*Failed attempt at Derail*
Got the entire series on steam for 20$
i have a demo, that's it
I got GRAW 2 from Ubishop for four bucks
I played one of them... Advanced Warfighter 2, I think?
Duke Nukem Forever, ponify it
nao.
Duke Nukem 1000
/me gives princey a cake
Not a bad game. Tough though.
Duke Nukem *Pinkie Pie* FOREVER
Duke Nukrestria Forever.
Hmm.
Mates and I only managed to pass the last couple of levels through attrition.
Leeroy Wingkins
^YES
I just remember that for no reason
Not sure if a lie or just tasty.
Episode 16
One of the contestants yells LETS DO THIS
And then Twilight mentioned something about 15 barrel rolls in a row.
ive no idea what ur talking about
lol
ohai
episode 16 of FiM

Leeroy Jenkins ponified

Nevermind
Wrong scene
Good morning, in fact.
I have kleptomania, but when it gets bad I take something for it.
Creepy as hell

@Superev1 : I'm glad I was here for that.

Late but
Who is? You is! Applejack
BORED
So who here doesn't afraid of anything
NEED CONFLICT
Maybe DRF can stop being critical :|
all the ponies in this town are CRAZY
I blame insanely catchy technomusic
I doesn't afraid of anything all day long.
02the heck?
Yes it's really badly done, I don't care. :E
That is just terrible Prime
so since we're doing old meme now, The Game
I know it is, Ivan
It's not even a ponified fear
?
Wait .... WHAAA * two hours* AAAT ?
Not close enough.
Although I can easily imagine Fluttershy as a replacement ALMA
I cannot ....
I see your meme Nightbomf, and raise you with I Can Haz Poniez?
All your base are belong to us
I suddenly want to discuss potential Horror games with the main villain replaced with ponies
Dancing Baby is a pony.
I am more pony than you can handle.
GBYE@!@!
awww
wait
What is a good Pinkie Pie horror game?
0huh, it's 12 15 for him... he must be exhausted
:(
Fluttershy alma?
WHAT THE HELL.
ikr
Yes
:/
Eh what? That is creepy.
speaking of
Rainbow Dash has a Posse. (20% Cooler, 10 seconds flat)
I'm looking for that silent ponyville fanfic
Because Alma is quiet
Oh god new sticker idea
I started reading it this monring
And so is fluttershy
LeTiredDCD, you here?
And if you've ever played the end of F.E.A.R. 2
Yeah, I suddenly regret associatting anypony with FEAR
I played FEAR and seen FEAR2
i prefer the first one
Point Man FTW.
Look up the ending for the 2nd one
FEAR ponified would be FRIENDSHIP
Hum... i think i'm going to sleep ... it's 6:17 am after all ....
For the new lunar republic !

Whyy not?
ITS AWESOME
I dunno then, I'd stream something for you guys but it's pretty late (early) here.
AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE SAYING OR WHAT MOST OF THOSE ANIMES ARE!
that pic is repulsive
wow
KILL IT
Does that count as scootabuse?
Nightmare_Moon: ... wow
KILL IT WITH THE PLASMA CUTTER
That's actually quitte the impressive pic
:o
Why did you link that? :S
Line Gun or Pulse Rifle work better against those little jerks
03it takes multiple people to keep a fad going.
03and it's about time it stopped.
hi
WHY
lol i got my new phone, t'iz boos
It's not even a 'fad'.
boss&
/me doesn't get it
Some people just like it, so what?
It'll stop when people stop liking it
Is pokemon a 'fad'?
yeah :|
-_- wow i suck at typing today -_-
It WAS kinda
Get what?
Aww, appearently, linking ponified horrorgames loses my specialness.
Now it's more of a way of life
/me runs
What specialness?
voice
I just remember it fondly as one of my childhood games. :/
the link? was it a reference?
burn
yes
Dead Space
Voice?
tis a game of great
It's my first :3
Scootabuse saddens me :<
;-;
Gold~
<Nightmare_Moon> Aww, appearently, linking ponified horrorgames loses my specialness. <-fording platforming games is more fun. http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5743/fordthatzone.png
Someone said ponify horror games, So I linked them Dead Pony
Lol. Even as a nightmarish beast from beyond, Scootaloo doesn't have a cutie mark :)
RE4 > Dead Space
RE5 > Dead Space 2
I think you mean
RE4 < Dead Space
hmm
RE5 < Dead Space 2
that 2nd pic had no ponies, shame on you
RE5 was an absolute disaster, I heard.
HL2 > RE4&DeadSpace
there correct
RE5 is NOT better than deadspace 2
no way
^Win
(RE4 < Dead Space) < (RE5 > Dead Space)
the halflife series has never been a horror series
we don't go to ravenholm
I could argue RE4 is better than the first or both of them
I started with blue. (: I loved that game.
but Dead Space did some really cool things with HUD and intereacting with teh enviornment
So is the pound puppies reboot any good?
its k
I wish I still had it. :(
Blue ia actually pretty nice
Gold was amazing though
"the halflife series has never been a horror series" Neither has Dead Space
I keep seeing the ads for it but I always leave after watching MLP
Also, ZekeS|AFK, you betrayed me, after giving me a +
:3
Or Resident Evil
And I still have Blue >:3
agh whats RE?
/me flees
oh nvm
Yeah, I had gold too, my sister had silver.
lol
I think the battery died in my blue.
I got GS and C
Then I lost it. :'(
aaaaaaaand silence
I will grant you that DeadSpace isn't as much horror as it is gore and startling butt...
Deadspacecertainly has more atmosphere than RE, and it takes place in a VACUUM
I had crystal too, yeah.
its more horrifiying than halflife
In shelter 17, we must rely on the one free puppy
So yeah RE5 > RE4 > Dead Space 2 > Dead Space
Hi
I haven't played any of those games D:
hey bronies
sup
Ivan, you placign RE5 at the top of that saddens me greatly
Portal 2 is a horror game!
hi
Why?
Its RE5 with COOP
CO-OP > EVERYTHING ELSE
oh, well okay
:c
Sorry, What Retsa>?
RE5 was shit, it's back to the same nonsense that made RE 1-3 bad
if you think that way, sure
ok why are we talking about video games when we could be talking about ponies?!
Portal 2? Horror?
03this is a much better conversation
RE4 was okay by my book
RE5 = RE4 With Co-op
Not even close mate.
03and I need a screwdriver that can open GB games
03so i can replace the battery in my silver
RE5 is bad how?
If we have ponies that control the sun and moon, are there ponies that control galaxies?
I like wings, so pegasi ponies rule
EXACT SAME GAMEPLAY WITH TWO PEOPLE
Greetings everypony

hi

>Better conversation
sapce ponies
Wut?
03it doesn't have to do with MLP
ew
:(
03automatically better
There was no conversation before, I just posted a link and you jumped on me.
Or maybe a galaxy sized pony with a planet sized pony inside of it and a moon sized pony inside of that
No scary games anymore.....
drf, you need what is called a security screwdriver
Amnesia being the sole exception
03can you link me to one?
that will look like a smaller inverted hex yead
Also my friend has a screwdriver to open them.
*head
Nightmare_Moon: Cyril approves this message
Amnesia oh god
I might have the right bit on my screwdriver set
Amnesia.. now THAT is how you build a good horror game
Ponify Anmesia!
Oi
http://d.facdn.net/art/missmab/1306039259.missmab_bird_call.jpg
how?
I agree with dari
bah, the whole "ponies controlling nature" thing is full of scientific plot holes, dont even try to figure it out
Drf wtf with that "better conversation"
03well
03it's like
It had the pacing Dead Space lacked, while it had the scary monsters RE lacks
So it's agreed Amnesia > Every horror game ever
In terms of horror
