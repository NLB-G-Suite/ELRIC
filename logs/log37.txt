that actually affects taste?
Ego much?
6That's all that matters
0>Implying coffee doesn't already taste horrible
i dont drink coffee i wouldent know
8except you steered us into a damn asteroid!
0coffee from a glass mug is actually dangerous.

Coffee rules.
6MonseiurLeFlour, you have disgraced yourself
0since the heat might cause the glass to shatter

It was nice working with you all.

how?
I wish I had some cigarettes right now
/me 6has been cyndered.
Not long enough.
I don't like the corruping little girls part. this is the 'bright' side f the fandom
For the show's first anniversary or something, maybe?
6Still another hour...
bye guyz
Why do people hate OC ponies again?
seriously?
6Yep.
aww
Yah, the OC ponies here are awesome!
0Eating bugs is heresy
hey look it's Bart again
Whats the nexzt movie after this?
It's their Mary Sue/Gary Stu-ness that sets people ff
6This is the last movie.
Hi Danfish.
6After this is post-show.
oh

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue
Maybe I've been hanging out in different bits of the fandom, but I haven't noticed a lot of godmoding among OC ponies.
Some, sure.
well, it's ponies. XD
8dumb bitch
XDD
Well, most people tend to give their ponies wings and horns
Ha
6*icypoke*
REally?
0Rifle = brain
And I think that's something only Celestia and Luna should have
quite
Yes
Hm. I haven't noticed a lot of alicorn OC ponies. Once again, possibly just different bits of the fandom.
looks like MC lost
Alright, thanks
Disregard rank, aquire bruises
Hi
lol
LOL
*from
Mmmmmmm *rolls arounds on the groud*
0I thought she said forget it, Rainbow
lol xD warhammer
0Imperial Guard and Imperial Navies don't mix
Also, Steampunk ftw
I would rather just stick to the ground if I could draw
I think most people know not to make alicorns and such
6Warhammer 40k is win
i'm on everything.
0Tyranids are win
For the most part, most oc ponies have been decently thought out, I've not seen many alicorns or wildishly outragous ponies
I don't really get the whole RP thing anyway
0Heretics have more fun
ikr
6Tyranids are AMAZING
If I had an OC pony I would stick to being earth, seems normal for me.
Some in the Drawfriend are overdone, though...
0Dem zoanthropes
/me points to Celestia
Although I don't have an OC pony because of two reasons
0Heresy Heresy Everywhere!
And I can't draw
Something like a "Death Pony" is gonna be incompatible with canon any, doesn't matter how over-the-top you go with it.
YOU ARE THE SAME BEING
6Like, epically.
I'd be a unicorn, because magic is awesome.
Same
0Francis voice: I hate Necron Monoliths
I'd just like to state for the record. I'm not streaming when we do LotR.
And NOT just because of ponies
Though it seems like most unicorns can't control their magic nearly as good as Twilight
Nope.avi
Hey it's ODST... wai...
No, they just specialize in one aspect
Twilight is, for all intents and purposes, a theoretical physicist.
I'm trying to minimize my OC's because while i have more freedon in their personalities than canon, i need to be extra-careful
More like a practical physicist
Most unicorns are I can do everything. Unicorns are supposed to excell above all at one specific skill
lol
kablamo
*trollface*
TS's Element should be Logic
*aren't
Twilight is hax
ships*
Dunna
0lol
Dunno
0shitcluster
Also, most pegasi are people like RD
Logic isn't a part of Friendship.
Twilight can do everything, but that doesn't mean she can do it well
...sayin'.
oo
kk
lol
Like fluttershy
6incoming SCARABs
marine rush
We have quite a few earth ponies
i usually only see pics of OC;s
What is the discussion topic?
0produce more medivacs
I dunno
It's like D-Day all over again.
CivPony... I would play that.
Need more supply
OC Ponies
4DCD should probably be available for that
Earth ponies: Superior in strength, stamina and durability
That's the topic?
not the civpwnies again
Best pony race?
Unicorns, intelligent, magic
No, I won't bring it up
0BANELING BOMB
That's the topic, I guess...
They do have a plan, and it involves charging at the enemy
Why are you writing in bold?
But it's still in the topic thing
Pegasi; speed, extreme personality
WHY NOT
You see I don't like that.
by the way fair warning, this tarren player sucks :D
0They should have standard bearers
X-treme
SHOOT THE LEGS
I could have sworn he was just here.
Fluttershy isn't extreme at all, flutterage and stare aside.
THROW KNIVES
Fluttershy is an earth pony with wings.
0Needs more tactical genius
6DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
but she's extreme on the OTHER END
fluttershy can be pretty extreme.
More Speed and Dexterity
She doesn't like speed.
Wat
Pegasi are light, fast, agile and they can FLY YEAH.
hana ha haaaaaaa
WAT
HUH?
I need to go now. Have fun everypony. Thanks for the stream
To be fair, Luna and Celestia are goddesses :p
Flamerunner = Pinkie Pie
but they're not OC Ponies
The Racer Pegasi, not the Fluttershy Pgasi, of cours
bye
ANDDDD
0Bye
0so is there nothing after this?
Hello?
Alicorns: We rule you
OBEY
did Cave Johnson Send you?
._.
0Is that bart?
0Antlions everywhere!
yeah
Although that would be awesome.
Yep, Alicorns are the best type.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u0FKJJclZM&feature=related
0did he die?
where's life's manager?
yes
Alicorns are basically uncorns with wings. Their defining aspect if their extreme magical ability.
0Sweet
I need to see him...
he got ripped to pieces xD
In a place called #EquestriaAfterDark
Go blow them up for me
Thaluka is right
celestia has other people to fly for her.
Alicorns is pretty much all of them.
why dont they just use the bojoomikaz or somtang
8RUN AWAY!
Run Away!
Uhh I'll wait for life's manager to go someplace else
hay everypony
Over Powered
Hence, why only Luna and Celestia are one.
FAll back !!!!
ff lol
0"we outnumber them? Run!"
man that place is awkward
just nukes
8evil cameraman
There are only two alicorns in Equestria AND the two are godesses
0bugs have old media
0Ravener out of nowhere
*spontaniously combusts*

Cameraman is gonna get a field promotion too
Alicorns: We rule you
the tarren player forgot to build medics or else this plan would have worked xD
/)^3^(\
originally, my oc could earth bend, you know special connection with the earth and all
oops i killed muffin_overlord_derpy
Time to rethink the Charge and Die tactic.
0Cameraman but no unit standerd beaer?
Pegasi: We eat for you
>Insulting name
0The didn't bring enough manticores
>Bully Pegasi
Earth Ponies: We work for you
Nooooooo
Derpy.
That camera should have a gun
>Bully Pegasi voice actress
Pegasi: F*** THE POLICE
0Charge and Die tactic is turning out as planned
lol i jst didnt wanna use rainbow dash cuz i knew somebody would already have it
LOL I LOVED THAT
Pegasi = greatest pony race.
0especially the Die part

he shoulda died
0Not many people seem to have died

0yeah, lots of work to do
Dragons are a pony race?
Did they even bring food?

funnywaytospellPinkiePie.jpg

"Spike is the best pony. Of course!"

0seems working to me
No angel is the best pony!
f*k Sh* Stack?
With the same/similar personality.
Whoever the best pony is, it is NOT A PONY
I agree
We underestimated their ability to kill us in horrible, horrible ways.
:D
Atleast they didnt lie to the people like they did in starcraft
hes a dinosaur
that name is a reference to Lao Tzu, isn't it?
brb learning Spiderwebs on Guit.
guardians of treasure?
But they sit on a sofa, not in a cav.
0There are always more Imperial Guard

Good job. Wake him up during the painful surgery.

nah, RD's just lazy
I went to get some sleep at 11 AM. XD
*naps
0exactly
Yeah, Rainbow is lazy
Rainbow dash should also be stuffing her face with the hunger of a thousand Pinkie Pies.
Deserts have no clouds
But she doesn
RD naps all the time to make up for the allnight raves.
No clouds means you have to come down sometime
Pegasi should also be very light in comparison
ergo Rainbow Dash is just a lazy pony
wasted bullets :D
Cool.
RD is an awesome pony.
0just to make sure
RD is the best pony

How dare you all >:(

sand isn't the best for digging tunnels through
AVeryStrange, that's a good opinion of yours.
Did it worked?
especially dry sand

0Ponies are good for the men's morale
Deserts aren't entirely sand, ever been to the grand canyon?
Then you have the whole young bussinesspony angle.
That doesn't count >=(

Yes it does
i was one of those assholes during the school year
AND you have her reason of going to the gala.

aren't the ponies destorying the natural balance of nature by intervening ?
0Disregard flamers, allow cover saves.
i win the war
or firebats which ever
how?
You haven't answered anything I said
Starving how?
...
We have orchards
6I've been running my tripcode generator for 2 weeks, querying a 10-letter tripcode, not case-sensitive.
They should have turrets of something
and supply trains
6No results.
Nick, in their world the nature does her balance herself only at wild places.
how do trees grow without sunlight
xD
you run out of food eventually
orchards GROW
Not really unlucky.
Revolver: Sieg Heil!
= Everfree Forest
ok
AVeryStrange: Its very easy to simply assume sister didn't have the 6th element when I was banished, or else she would've released me from Luna right then and there.
Revolver: Like I said, FLOATING ISLANDS>
6It's because it's currently generating in the Rs, and the trip I need is in the As.
yeah, me too. But it's 2 weeks!
Plants + sunlight = photosynthesis = food for plants
and fair enough haha
[17:48] Siriusgamer: hey man
[17:48] Siriusgamer: one of my friends is a bronie
[17:49] Siriusgamer: how do i handle this situation
[17:50] MortalPenguin0X: ...
[17:50] MortalPenguin0X: Dunno
[17:50] MortalPenguin0X: IF he doesn't try to convert you
[17:50] MortalPenguin0X: everything's fine
[17:50] Siriusgamer: he did
[17:50] Siriusgamer: hes like
[17:50] Siriusgamer: YOU GOTTA WATCH DIS SHIT MAN
a normal day in Xfire
we use that too
6I have more Rarity trips than any humen could possibly need.
Clouds move on their own
You can't have a safe base
without clouds
Revolver: No, the don't.
*they
We are experts at ground combat
if not....
let me recheck the intro
well lets just say it isn't safe in the everfree forest
are you kidding me? That's 14 times this thing has dropped me today!
We'll manage
Revolver: We CONTROL the clouds. We are the Pegusi. (/DUne 200 referance over)
AND UNDER THE OPRESSIVE RULE OF THE UNICORNS
I wanted one with rainbow in it, managed to get raINbow.0s
Clouds aren't natural in the everfree
What are "Pegusi"?
You should know that
*Pegasi
0Searching for one with Rainbow right now
Ivan is right
My name is too long for a tripcode
9 letters.
Pegasi can't control weather on wild places such as Everfree forest
*sighs*
Revolver: Places you can't control?
6Trips generate 10 letters
yep but theres wild animals in it
Reload !!!
that are dangerous
I am? How? Please tell me.
We send rebels to infiltrate equestria and sabatoge important strategic locations in pegasi adn unicorn territory
Hi everypony!
and kill ponies.
0in the future, you don't need to reload
well hide then
0PROMOTIONS
Living in the everfree forest wasn't going to be easy
yes rip it out
let it bleed
0in the future, you don't need to aim.
best idea :D
Very, but they IMPLY that they're different and something about not control on the show.
12Did you get my text Nick? ovO
Why pull it out?
FLAWLESS VICTORY.
O_o
oh, dari, where you from dude?
because he wanted to get shot
You lose accept it
I assume to allude that there is a sixth
8Looks like they got...
8*puts on sunglasses*
Hmm, that could be it
8fired
11HIPSTER: YEEEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
I'm from the UK.
0YEEEEAAAAAH
noooooooo!!!!
or the moon
lol
Revolver: REVOLVER used ULTRAMARE-INES!
Find a stronger source of magic to fight her!!!!
victory.
Rainbow says something about Everfree weather
brb
<3
It seems logical that there were only five at the time, since yeah, otherwise Celestia would have had the power to undo NM
(@Hipster)
best acting evar! :D
*sighs*
I live near Reading.
Also, I just noticed in the creation myth scene Celestia's hair turns blue the very scene after my banishment, I can only conclude that her role in raising both sun and moon gave her rainbow hair.
nothing stops the other ponies from farming...
0Just shoot her already
8DAT OVERACTING
0you had barely any screen time with her
We hide amongst the civilians
15 times dropped...
ohoho, not far from me dude, I'm like one train stop from reading
0<- bristol here
Maybe we should put Spider's web in our movie lineup.
she sees all
0yep :3
Where they can die, and be tricked and all that
/me spams Nick
eurobronies ftw
Can see read minds or have foresight
arc is sadface
isnt it already?
he is american
I still win.
lmao
AVeryStarge: I'll watch the episode later to see that.
shame on you for where you were born :D
*Strange
I believe it was bridle gossip?
Yes
Great
No ponies on the TV in UK yet though. :(
8arcesious: http://cdn.wg.uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/america-fuck-yeah.jpg
0and no merch
DARI, IN JULY
Cartoon Network
july
PONIES
Then we take over the whole of the UK.
0No ponies here in Sweden either. Don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, though.
Earth ponies are banished to the moon, she sends all ponies on trains to be carefully examined
0and no 90% of custom pony merch
one by one she banishes the few that hide
/me eats tins of spam
ponies on cartoon network?
yeah arti
8worst funeral speech ever
replied to it :3
cool
Ponies on cartoon network. In july.
>inb4 ww2
*sarcasm
and she waas my Fuck buddy
11RainbroDash: You mean the'yll actually have something GOOD to watch on CN?
that was also the only body they recovered lol
i don't have cable.
6They didn't have the bodies for the others.
regular show
>implying he did kill all the jews
12Ahh thanks!
12Ok got it :>

Quit Stalinin
She died for their sins
That's awesome
Apprently
DUnno
lol texting
:B*
If left to it he probably would have done.
wouldent that not be a good thing
kinda
What's stopping celestia?
He would never have killed all the jews man
It's just not possible
there are already 15 people already *shrugs*
0i dunno why people care about television at all
15 year olds**
Same with celestia, you can't find EVERY SINGLE PERSON EVER
i dont have a tv
calling it now
Or in this case EARTH PONY
0same
oh dear
Okay, I blinked and missed this, what's this about Hitlestia?
Slowly one by one they are drained in numbers
just keep them out of /rp/
0so i dont even pay for tv licence
and i'll survive
I think I've won rafa
ponies being cool?
I win by banishing them to the moon.
0Ponies are already cool
I don't like to base how you treat someone or think of someone on their age.
cool, but in an uncool way
to us yea
>with tiny numbers
They gots a bunch of noobs
but i mean cool as in
0ponies already suffer from getting into mainstream. (see fawx news)
Sir, I think that something wrong going on with me... I'm starting to think like an... Earth Pony!
kinda cool
like that
Cool
*moon banishes rafa*
i don't discriminate based on age.
wow it certainly didn't take long for the hate to take over, did it?
13I don't need to text that often because I'm usually able to just talk to people online xD
I think she can.
but i know from experience to expect the worst of anyone younger than 14
06^
Alright then how about this
It's cold in here Ivan.
06but of course, everything has its use :p
Celestia moon banishes you.
I doubt she has the power
>luna helps
Flammerrunner how r u going to breath?
Then mentor them in the way of ponies.
Why would Luna want all these shmucks on her moon?
11My consern is that we'll get a flood of 4chan-like kids into Ponychan that don't know the meaning of the words "nice", "Responsibility" or "Opinion"
she needs company
mentor them to me more intelligent
if you look me in the back they're open
OMFG r pony getting moar cancerous
She's already back on earth/equestria
Everypony is welcome. Everypony is loved. Our sites have moderators to take care of bad behavior.
also now they'll respect her darned moon.
Just like people "respect" Alcatraz?
She can teleport us back
have you seen her all this season?
none of my friends even like ponies :(
Plus I still think you don't have the power, but if celestia does then why not luna?
but ponies brath from the front of there face dont they?
But Luna is not in the moon...
*breath
I never stepped foot on reddit.
Banishment for a 1000 years
0I expected to see more bugs in this movie.
*hipsterface*
only my extremely annoying friend likes ponies
And you are ignoring the issue
STOP THINKING LIKE AN EARTH PONY, YOU FOAL. Soryy. Had to do that.
*Sorry
But you have no use
jkjk
06D:
06<3
Special beam Cannon!!!!! * destory the Moon*
I don't even know our exact nubmers
me neither
From my experience most kids seem to start to mellow out and mature at about 16-17
0*hipsterglasses on*
*numbers
11Misery: You say that like it's a bad thing.
!Espeon
Celestia is a Sun Goddess... of course she cans!
14-15 they're usually okay too
^my point exactly
0atleast we might be able to say "I like ponies before they were cool and sold out"
i suppose it isnt a bad thing lol
8dari is a mod, he aint gotta explain shit
I'm learning, Commander.
If she can move the sun she can teleport ponies to the moon.
8good idea dari, thats the best way to use it
0white background is a little annoying tho
I fail to see how the show being more popular is bad. It means more income for the creators and more seasons for us to watch
Celestia's either a gambler or has some sort of omniscience given that she was banking on Twilight (read: introverted nerd) going and making exactly 5 friends in a 12 hour period.
Goddess provides resistance.
8dealwithit.jpg
(Okay wait it was closer to 24 but still)
i think its more of the idea of the fanbase being polluted
sorta
Without even know where they are?
eeeeeyup
Don't you need a specific target for magic to work?
Ivan, she can RAISE THE FRIGGIN' SUN. Of course!
/me flees
8the day we start excluding people from our fanbase is the day we stop becoming special
VERY HARD
11The problem isn't that it'll be popular. The problem is that the fandom may attract the wrong kind of people.
Raise the Sun OOOOOR move the Earth. You choose.
We are scattered EVERYWHERE
And we aren't just Earth Ponies only
I don't see why it matters though.
*sighs*
That's just our main rank
You are just earth ponies.
You get annoying people in every fandom.
We have a few, only a few, rebels from other races
Celestia controls the rest.
not to cut in, but Dari has a point.
I'm not worried about the chan. The mods over there are great. Honestly I think there's a lot more diversity in this little fandom than we might think. There's nothing wrong with adding more
I just hope we don't labeled very badly
Controls?
yep
mind control
Barry this is an open discussion, please feel free to get stuck in :P
As in mind-control?
Prove it
how else does she enable harmony across the land
you still need to and I destoryed the moon
I first discovered it online
Well for one thing WE ARE F*CKING REBELLING
when behaviours such as stealing are seen in the show
My first episode was Pinkie Keen, in fact
erego you can't uprise
^
you are all celestia's mindslaves ^_^
11I don't care for the hugbox label
I don't think that's logically sound
At all
._.
People you don't know or care about label you. notasinglefuck.jpg
let whoever is into ponies join, I say
I don't mind the hugbox thing
i give everyone hugs
Here's to 20 million page views before Season 2
>_>
ikr
YEAH
/me yawn
20 MIL
20m is too easy
Lemons, why Celestia would be on our side?
Okay, back to war
8exactly, dari
/me 13also yawns
50m is a challenge
13;;
0just to piss people off
because she's a pegasi?
proceed on mission
11It's when people start getting derogatory about it like calling all of us coltcuddlers and crap like that.
No... she's an Alicorn
She is an Alicorn
yeye^
8sathi: about the same
and its her job to make harmony across the lands?
yea
And pegasi are puppets to the unicorn
aww any idea what's causing it?
8yeah
8its because its blu-ray quality
11Sathi: It's because of the vid's quality
06Yay :3
Ivan, sorry but Pegasi are not.
Who's to say she just won't kill both our races and leave the Unicorn?
After all if she wants harmony, just get rid of both problems no?
8SECRET BRAIN FUN
we're too awesome to be culled
Unicorns aren't doing anything
earth and pegasi
NOmNOMNOMONOMONOMNOMONMONOM
why would she kill them both.
6I don't think it's a bandwidth cap.
0*siiiiip*
6Because the lagging is on my end.
0Delicious brain, you must drink it.
Why not? She needs harmony and we are both fighting
06Good luck :P
BRAINBUG WINS FATALITY
*help
12DA has quizzes?
^its hr job to make harmony in equestria
a long time b- man
EXACTLY
BOLD AND CAPSLOCK: NO
Wait...They have a plan?! Does not compute!*brain implodes*
She has to do something
13Journal quizzes :3
I already know I'm rather eccentric anyhow.
Orders of magnitude dude
xD
Even if you COULD get rid of us, she would only set her sights on you
13My journal is filled with them LOL
Sorry DJ.
0plans? Thats not how humans do things!
12Oh those!
why?
We're like 1.2% there already. :P
12I haven't done one in ages!
you're uprising
I finally did it
12I'm gonna start a thread on TST for that >3
we're defending her
spray and pray
11where sound go?
0aiming is for sissies
13Well I just found one that's "202 things about yourself" LOL
12(jk) But if anyone wants to, go for it ovO
therefore she takes our side.
06o.o
12LOL!
Who's to say she won't see you as a threat later?
action*
12Link, Angel?
12Pls?
Wait... the Earth ponies are attacking Celestia?
8not detective carter!
0inner censorship
11I just realized....all that stupid shit with the ferret at the beginning of the movie...that was a wasted subplot/Deus ex machima.
...because we defended her....?
And the Pegasi are defending?
yea same as last night
12SPOILERS
look at the government, it is DOMINATED by Unicorns.
13http://quizzes.deviantart.com/art/2-202-things-about-yourself-15472843
I just had an idea...
hahaha you sure?
^ivan loses
First us, then the Pegasi
in every way his uprising is flawed
Woe?
as a background pony.....
Every way >implying that you beat me when it was just supplies
*way
ivan2294: I see that as a function of the unicorn tendency to intellectual pursuits, which always lends itself to aristrocracy through wealth and public position
*pegasi
yes but you don't have celebi either >
I lol'd
*Wouldn't that be awesome
>>*
/me runs!
0add another genocide to humanities honours.
06tempting
That'd make the pony semi-canon
13do eet
13:P
I have no problem with the Pegasi, only the opresssing Unicorns
I'm not going to argue any more, I;ve won.
ok now I have celebi
>impling you won
Unicorns aren't oprissing
OK everybody time to take another planet
It's just something people say.
*opressing
does anyone have a Kyogre frome HG to trade?
0Damn it! Bart lived!
Meh I don't see a problem with unicorns
its another meme that everyone use
0it looks dirty
ITS AFRAIDDDDDDDDD
>mayor mare is an earth pony.
0too suggestive
8ITS AFRAIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I just wanted a regular war
But you just HAD to pull the over-powered card on me
0FEAR US
:\ I can't tell if all y'all are having as much fun as me or actually fighting here.
nah, this is fun
sorry there avery
0did she get impaled?
hole*
Although it was more fun when we were on equal footing
why did they just fucking nuke the place?
*yawn*
Yep, that's pretty fun.
You beat them by nuking them from orbit.
0The adrenaline rush takes away the pain
And now I leave. (P.S. Viva la Luna rebellion)
Penetraned
I think we have a flawless victory
The only trump card you have is Celestia, you must be pretty desperate to pull that one
CENSORED
>win war
The censor bar! IT DOES NOTHING!
Then prove it
As I explained you'd slowly die one by one in the forest
wait wat
Not all earth ponies
for three more movies
Just most
0it means nothing!
there we go.
As I explained we have a supply system and orchards
Why are most of the Earth Ponies attacking?
well... that movie was okay.
OPRESSION FROM UNICORNS
not great though.
0notice THEY'LL win, not WE'LL win
Man, this movie just confuses me.
0the irony
propaganda war film
Supply SYSTEM
oh gosh
Unicorns aren't opressing...
oh gosh
0yay
11yay
WOO!
it made me laugh though out the time
YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS
BTW, Celestia is an Alicorn. Not an Unicorn.
*Inhaled deeply*.....yay
0yay~
8I I I I DONT DONT DONT DONT
But she leads the unicorns
0*volume up*
LOL anyone else got video/audio desync?
Yo
11ahhhhhh!
...no, she leads all races....
11~*
it does.
11ahhhhhhhhhh~
And underground lakes are HUGE
Arcesious: I'll join you.
>and run out.
well be careful
Eventually, but then the rain happens
Now that's a cheer.
don't let it go over 12 decibels
Plus we also have the everfree
*pegasi control the skies.
No clouds get through
no rain.
exactly
Stupid =
11Tell him it's a special porno
*:
why, ponies of course!
D:
0i still dont get the title though
And we have a supply network
it's based off of a song
That's only in the everfree Nick
Pegasi controls all weather
yay~
0ah
0i see
6It's slightly desynced because of the fact that I have to run sound through VAC, dari.
except over the everfree forest
0need to check it out
such an amazing parody
it could cure cancer
8dari, awesome
Episode 4
niiice dari :D
best choice
if you go into the everfree forest you have to constantly defend from monsters
http://www.life.org.uk/
This is a guerilla war, we are EVERYWHERE
8best episode to convert imo is fall weather friends
Oh, I don't have mics plugged in/turned on unless I'm using them.
please just surrender
I've been there lots of times now and its really cool, they have a 3D motion ride and upstairs games room thing
Earth pony should go to the Everfree forest to make a base
NEVAH
12Yes we walked past it
but the entry fee is pricey :\
12ovo
Hey, my cancer's gone.
12How pricey?
6I am using mine.
I ACCUSE THE UNICORNS OF OPRESSING OTHER RACES
Which one was fall weather friends again?
And the pegasi are helping them
episode 13
well I remember it going in 18 it was nine pounds
8the one with the race
oh
12WHAT!!!
i remember now
Permission granted
12No way, sorry
you've fought well rafa
Government is full of Unicorns
12The younger lot arent gonna be able to afford that I'm sure
Thank you. Good luck and farewell.
*RD salutes
While we all work for them
for conversion.
12That really sucks >v>
*salutes back
yeah 9.95 now...
0I've converted with the pilot, Bridle Gossip and Swarm of the Century.
12-v-v-v-
11PINGAS!
*big boss smusic plays*
Luna: DReam mode?
okay then
AMMMMMMMMMMMMREIA FUCKYEAH
I'd go for Bridle Gossip
lol fail
I've been there too many times too to warrant that price I'm afriad
>slavery >dogs putting collar on rarity
You do know how guerilla wars work right?
yep
i starve you out of existance
lol amereia
That doesn't work
8party of one seems kind of girly to me though
Not in Guerilla wars
we survive in pegasi only or unicorn only areas
y'know I only realise aside from shops and bars there really isn't much to do in Newcastle
Tahts why you go to the everfree forest
8fall weather friends reminds me of old cartoons
hmmm
and my rarity brushable is nowhere to be found
11I prefer Winter Wrap Up for conversion.
8NFL
Awwwww....
:(
They can't kill us all
And some of us are good with animals
Nothing.
>zecore >immigrants
11porno = Rarity XD
Hmmmm
Fluttershy is NOT the only pony good with animals you know
/me burns it
D:
And we live everywhere
hey twottle you there?
she is also a pegasi
11:D
I have this one too
No, no I'm not...
she sets all animals against you
:D
Not with the animals at Celetia's palace
Apart, the songs are all horrible...
lol
Please I just want a normal fight
together... amazing.
0true
You just want to fight, period.
I enjoy strategy and tactics
Just saying ive won this
:(
11This is a good vid. The editing is spot on.
You do win with celestia, but I want to see how far I can get
NOWHERE ELSE IS
We live everywhere
EVERY
WHERE
they're hilarious.
this vid i agree is epic, but I dislike the songs :P
earth ponies cant stand on clouds
yup
bye
And where to not
Also, you work for the unicorns remember?
agreed
0ayep
>twilight could make them stand on clouds
I think all unicorns could do the same
Pinkie's section there was just too good.
they can only use the magic to help with there speical talent
they help each other out?
*willing
Remember twilight helped the rest out
She isn't that powerfull
all earth ponies are fighting right?
Millions of unicorn live all over the place
Not all
Luna: Dream Mode next?
ITS A GUERILLA WAR
pwease?
those that surrender we allow back
under containment in POW camps.
Would celestia really approve of that? I think not
Equestria is Earth in 30XX
how would you stop the unicorns from using magic?
That doesn't sound like harmony AT ALL
12I think I have some plans
6It's in the list.
ergo
...
tell plz?
:3
awesomes
Equestria
called it
i had it in my mind this would be the next one
wait i don't have this one
link please?
BBL
6That image is creepy.. o.o
6Along with ze music.. D:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1FE7yHGcAw&NR=1
And move everyone onto clouds
...
I win
besides i'm the tactician
this playing twice at once
it's really cool.
lol
just add clouds
this is way too cool.
Hmhmhm
but really cool sounding.
done.
6ZE EVIL!
Assuming Celestia would just listen to you is foolish

ONE POLITICIAN IS NOT ENOUGH
Shame it did not get played yesterday

the skies are no longer under their control
7And now she's awake. :U
they're running out of resources
THEN WE WORSHIPPED
7Yeah, I think she is, Nick.
But we aren't a conventional army like Gaddaffi's troopes
12<3

Only Derpy can spill her cheerios out of a gyro bowl.
alrighty then.
More like a terror group
I won this war about 30 minutes ago now
Only because of Celestia

0oh well, we can only discover that in season 2

oh boy
0if theyll introduce her again
That Topic has given me cancer
i really hope they do. she's my 2nd favourite background pony
0until that i'd consider it canon
/me passes around popcorn
D:
I give up
6My friend'd probably like this.. :P
*raises hand*
*hugs mongoose*
Send it...
I hadn't really considered her gender either way until I saw that she was female.
If only it were that easy BlankFlankBrony
0lime 3-4 episodes
Really?
Devin Fox's girlfriend gave him cancer
Also, why such an insulting name?
I just thought she was female, she looks it
11seriously?
I knew from the start all the main 6 were female.
11I just figured she was a dyke.
Though loads of people seem to think RD is male for some reason.
Self-descriptive.
How old are you?
0i didnt do any research before watching =)
29
0so i was kinda clueless
Nor did I.
I just watched it.
*takes a hanfdful from blankflankbrony's popcorn bag*
fix'd
Kill it.
11The only research I did was seeing the endless fanart on FA and DA
11oh, and a few PMVs
i'd not seen anything
Hi
6Youtube, y u buffer?
Hello.
just went straight in
if all else fails, try manure shovelling after horses
ew /b/
brb
manure is suprisingly valuable
Never been on 4chan.
xD
LSP is like totally
11They're holding that pose for a while.
I thought Rainbow Dash was male at first.
OMG
lol
0see
Hi Lucas
oh ya on the fucking moon!
Adventure Time
It's alright by me
I always thought she was female. O_o

walnuts ftw
11I really hope they don't fuck up Luna's personality in Season Two.
i have... lets see... 56 pony PMVs saved now.
11She's my favorite outside of the Mane Cast.
Pistachio is where it be at b*tches
*brohoofs zeke*
But she has no personality to ruin yet? O_o
0actually I have a lot of concerns abour derpy too
Cashews?
Filburts?
Cashews are good
WAIT
11Prince-Dari: She has a fanon personality that, IMO, is spot on for the little bit of character we've seen.
meh.
I hope they don't call Derpy "Ditzy Doo".
6http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v323/vehura/Slender%20Man/SlenderMan05.jpg ftw. :P
lol
lol
wow...Psychoshy has gotten 20% creepier
I'm allergic to pistachios D:
Awwww...
Hi Agnitio
A character that is a cross between Fluttershy and Twilight is my ideal idea of Luna's personality.
Meh.
11Arc: I know. :P
We were just talking about nuts
Cool
I prefer pistachio all the way
0i hope it wont be too bad
oh boy
11Anoponymous: thus my statement: I hope they don't fuck them up too much.
Things like that tend to end badly.
Kill it.
and thus this topic was born
this has been done too?
IT'S SPELLED SPIKE
*derailed*
BE
0the only way they can get away with it is to have very subtle Derpy occurance

RARITY IS #1
My point.

I don't care where Rarity is.
Rarity = annoying
Applejack is not amazing. Impressive, maybe... But not amazing.
Why, thank you.
It's <3 for my eyes.
I mean, only EMOS use them :>
Rarity is a whining...
Yeah

Do you want whining?

CS is more important to me than RP.
It does. XD
CS?
They're shoing a show about kittens on Animal planet
Cave Story.
Oh yes! *rolls around rubbing my arms*
13Well, I'll probably go to sleep when you do

LMFAO
Dont follow that advice
:
:P*

That was fast.
6What's it like?
Well complainers need my advice to set them on the right track ;p
Granted, the Wii version's MUSIC only sucked, and you can fix that, but still.
CPU version's still free.

[/legasp]
How did it go?
What's dangerous about contacts? XD
6This came out last year,right?
13you DO have to be fully awake during the whole procedure though :P
13and you apparently see everything they do xD
Hmm...eye scratching, infections..cleaning, hard lenses
Replacing them all the time :P
WHOO!
Came out in april
C'est amusant!
Hard lenses like
lol, I wanna see Fire's reaction to that...
Don't exist anymore.
"Derpy is oatmeal...WTF?!?"
Hard as in old contacts
I have been listening too Pinkie Pie's WHOO for FIFTEEN MINUTES!
FIFTEEN!
11Considering the movie we've recently watched, that's just creepy.
Which are very...uncomfortable :<
13Ew contact lenses
Takes care of all problems. XD
ONE FIVE!
6Ok..Just want to know for price and shizzle :P
I can wear my glasses 24/7 and keep them forever/over 2 years
FIVE MULTIPLIED BY THREE!
contacts are amazing
/me Le Came
lol wat
6people panic about them
6but
Nope.flv
6they're not bad
$60 here
13I daren't try them, I hate putting things in my eyes ;;
6it's the first week that's torture
You should panic more ;D
contacts sound uncomfortable
Pff, I rub my eyes all the time. xD
15
6I cried the first time
6Carp. >.<
i pressed enter and then thought "wait.... that's wrong"
6but after that it was whatever
FIFTEEN!
I had no problems at all, except getting the things in.
Totally worth it though
I'm gonna go ahead and shamelessly promote myself here: http://bloodisgood.org/minecraft/pony/#/-1408/64/128/-3
6weird analogy but yeh
Pfft, eyecysts from something that is supposed to help you see
Ironic XD
I have tiny eyes. x.x
6yeh I actually play with my contacts by rubbing my eyes
11Is this an auto playlist?
6and forcing them up into my eyelid and letting them slide back into place
Bad Bazul.
:P
13Gah, I can't watch diabetics take shots at all x_x
6Wait,I'll look it up on some site
That sounds..disgusting
6Meh.. :P
I got a cyst because I was doing it wrong, not because of the contacts themselves
11>.o
Then taking their blood suger >.>
Why is it disgusting? O_o
:'( ok...
11god...that's...so accurate.
I slept in them for about 8 months and never hanged them.
6...
Arrrg
Same here
o.o
6YOU SLEPT IN THEM?
WAT
6LOL
*changed
FOOLS
13In fact just the thought of injecting yourself with a needle makes me feel uncomfortable .w.
I did. XD
6that's horrible
6No auto playlist.
6yeh
Get glasses if you want to sleep with good vision
:P
6Just clicking whatever I see.
11ah.
6iI've slept in contact all of 3 times in the past 6 years
I can't wear glasses
dude...what's with the wall off in the distance? it looks baws
6 59 euros.. D:
Whynot?
O.,o
I have a pair
6and those were all at sleepovers when I forgot to bring my contact cases and solution
I can't wear them anymore
inflation of cash :D
Hmmmmm
6I have glasses, I refuse to wear them outside of my house
I did
thats the Citadel
02^
Everything looks wrong.
glasses are cool
13I have glasses now, I only wear them when I REALLY need to
Get a job... like I did... I hate my job... *sighs*
11Again...that's frighteningly accurate.
soon to contain temples to the Princesses
02Glasses 22/7 here,
or maybe I'm just that nerdy I dunno XD
Everything looks smaller and farther away, and I can't look sideways withoiut not being able to see
I can't wear them.
I see...
6glasses are uncomfortable for me
And when I complained, they gave me another pair
XD
6plus, I wear sunglasses A LOT
6Meh..So far I think to get PS3 with the two games I've chosen to get it's about 406 euros..Idk if I could get it yet -.-
Phoe commands it
I'm too sued to contacts to wear glasses now.

02Wat.
6I haven't given the job thing much thought..
My glasses are like over 400$
13I could've gotten UV sensitive glasses if I wanted to
Mine would have been if I didn't have awesome insurance.
i use to wear glasses for reading
They were only like, $100.
6I'm highly photosensitive unfortunately
Since I have a special pair, one lens is convex and the other is concave LOL
02I have a 50$ one. It has leasted over 3 years |D
6I can't drive without sunglasses
*BLINK*
*BLINK*
Long term glasses FTW

The sequel to Ep2 is delayed.
Maybe 1.5yrs, I forgot already
02mine are over... I can't even remember xD
6Hmm
You forget they're there.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- *kicked*
My first pair is bad now, my eyes have gotten even worse from 3 yrs ago XD
I got into the shower with them on a few times... XD
02I have had like 4 or 3 pairs of glasses
/me thinks about actually kicking Vividkinz for effect*
All three have great multiplayer
I've had 8.

Hay Bazul :)
Someone hilited me?
I can see far, but my eyes make it blurry all over XD
02W/o glasses I can barely see my hand xD
He's farsighted, yeah.
11o.o

/me is nearsighted and farsighted, kinda
Which is why his vision's blurry from using computers.

Trixie = Also Awesome, Twilight = Cute
Gigyas?
Trixie=Fail
i had to sell my wii and a bunch of other games to get a 3ds
I would never sell a system for a system.
Fluttershy - Supercute!
Fluttershy is supercute.
agreed
and I am
But... I'm not... that cute... am I?
Wait for the Wii U
:D
when I heard the wii u isn't supporting gamecube software
that sealed the deal for me
still getting a wii u though
eventually
XD
02yay~
Yeah of course you are!
02I know, but still
02xD
i think I'll go with the 3ds version
02...
I want a 3DS for OoT. Nothing else.
hey
02How do you dare?!
i like the portability D:
Wii U > Wii > 3DS
there are a lot of games coming up for it that I am looking forward to
Sorry, but yeah
02Nah
;>
Oh my, I've talked too much on the IRC.
most of them no one knows about XD
Back to lurking.
Fluttershy
you're cute
02Wii U > 3DS ~ Wii
but i still ... uhmm... "like" Derpy.
N-no....
:P
:P
HD Zelda <3
*blush*
which is looking more and more awesome to me
02MOSTER HUNTEEEER <333
I have Tri
02Ihrida, Do you play?
02sidusvkdn
how is it?
02Europe or America?
But I don't have a PSP anyhmore
America.
02HR?
EW PSP
Uhhhh
Kill it :<
Somewhere between 10 and 20
Have you played a PSP?
02mine is 14 or 16
02anyway.
02Let's play... now
Once, I laughed at how silly it was
I used to make fun of the PSP
CDs, on a handheld
i've played like three games for it
HAHAHAAAH, no
Then I got one and sad faced at my ignorance.
Pfft, best at being slow XD
I have one
Pff
Mine was my fastest cconsole
tbh completely honest, DS>>>>PSP
PSP GO sucks, and the unhackable ones are terrible
....
You must have a crap PSP
*to be
Yeah
Gos are awful
no UMD drive.
AKA most PSPs now :P
UMD is terrible anyway
I have a DS, but to be honest compared with the PSP it seems pretty poor.
If you're an idiot, yes.
I had a case for UMD's
XD
02XD
I still do, actually
I don't need a case for my carts :p
Me either
And I lsoe them
Often
Why waste more money on a case? XD
And if they get wet, they break
Not exactly
the psp has its perks, i admit
They all still work XD
The DS is the way to go
PSP
wtf that was unexpected
02DSlite is the best IMO
PSP actually ahd about the same am ount of games
/me flees
Most just aren't largely publicised.
I can't afford one, though.
XD
If you wanted a decent and cheap touchscreen with tons of games, and BC, get a DSlite :P
Lol.
hi again
I never even use the touchscreen.
Hey.
*great
$99 I believe
Hello
$99.00 now, yup
just decided to check back in
Neither do I, but it's still fun to play with :>
How much is a PSP?
About the same price, I believe
not that she wasn't awesome herself
12Ew PSP
I haven't had one for about 6 months
130$
Mine broke
that's about it
but not the fanon...
Not $130
Unless you go for Go's
and Go's suck
02[/late]
I saw them $120 half a year ago
> Not hackable > Slow UMDs > Thumb thingy
PSP's are hackable
02PSP, ARE easily haxable
lol
02So is the 3DS
And the DS isn't easily hackable?
We already said it was.
^
02@Price, it is. But the DSi - DSi XL aren't
My UMD's loaded über quickly
It was about 3 seconds
Everything is easily hackable.
Well the DS loads in 0
Beat that ;p
Same load time as a DS cartridge
You just need good enough people to be bothered to try.
Ihrida, don't be silly
I'm not being.
XD
I actually had both.
And used them borh
02and that's due I'm playing games with a R4
Regularly
R4s are meh
/me speaks like a turret* HellooOOoo?
I'm never buying one :P
My DS Lite
(Silly Piracy)
Actually has a common defect
http://www.gamespot.com/features/6159832/under-the-hood-psp-load-times/p-2.html
The screen doesn't stay up anymore.
Yet again, My PSP loaded at the same speeds as a DS. XD
Maybe I just had an awesome one
Well you must have a modded one
I didn't
I used official firmware
where...did everypony go?
gg\
just waching
And I didn't plug it in
It was updating
And bam
XD
My Warranty was done
7o.O
They went from here to The Outer Limits.
Good, it deserved to die :D
Not really
Yeah really :>
Boomed?
The Outer Limits?
they got cheap.
/me was just shot
???
They failed with the PSP and PS3
Fl-Fluttershy?!?
Never failed
The PSP and PS3 are great
lol again
They tried too hard after the PS2 :P
Just expensive
the psp...eh
i mean like
Not really. XD
like I said, it has its perks
and superior graphical power
I just like good things.
Like I said earlier
Uhm... hey!
They have about the same amount of games
*Was not the culprit*
But the PSP's games weren't publicised
I run across games I never knew came out.
Wait...
Hold on.
/me is dying
but the thing is, the good titles on the ds appeal to me a lot more than sony's do
/me revives Fluttershy_RP*
The only reason why the PSP sold...was due to the graphics lol
That's where the entire argument lies, really.
title appeal.
02You haven't played GoW right?
personal taste
and for me it's the ds, but I'm not saying the psp doesn't have its fair share of good games
I prefer slightly less childish games, which the DS lacks greatly.
Hust a sec.
they have a few, but not many that appeal to me.
/me died
*just
I perfer slightly less adult/violent/shooter games
:p
http://www.facebook.com/mylittlepony/posts/233802666637178?ref=notif&notif_t=feed_comment
I revived her, though...
That idea.
what's "childish" is subjective really
I personally don't like GoW
how did she die?
the ds has a LOT of rpgs
I revived her!
which I like
I only like a few series of RPG the DS carries
02true, DS RPG's are awesome (Valkyrie Profilee <333)
The DS has BC with the GBA :P
And the Wii lacks practically any RPG's
why is it backwards
Which has even more RPGs
If they make that a real contest, that'll be awesome.
The GB = <3
Also, there's a rainbow outside my window.
I have every model of Gameboy though.
the world ends with you is one of the ds's best games
4I'm too busy paying attention the crap that permeates /oat/
Once sec.
but thats the thing...it wasn't publicized enough
02GB <3333 GBC <33333333 GBA <3 GBA:SP </3
6never played it
She's Derpy, I guess.
6kinda want to lol
it's awesome
to not do copy write things
in every way
How do you pronounce "Lyra?" I would assume it's liar-uh, as that's how the instrument's name is pronounced, but I'm tempted to pronounce it leer-uh since it's a name...
o
6k
ok then
thanks
sequel for the 3DS = <3
well
But yeah.
FF6 3DS plz
I think it'd be a cool contest.
-E
I pronounce it "Lie-Ruh"
idk
With the way Square is
Pretty sure it's with an "i" sound.
many said it was too complicated, but I found it pretty simple
and I HATE complicated and convoluted rpgs
Fairly Oddparents?
I loved this show when I was little!
=/
It hasn't aired on Nick regularly since 2006. Ohh, and umm, hi!
hi
FFVII and FFX do
ff4 got a DS remake
It's on Nicktoons Network now
and a psp collection
and a wii ware sequel
The DS remake didn't have the sequal.
lol grinch
How do you get outed as a mod anyway? I thought they didn't tell anyone?
I doesn't get that channel.
The PSP collection has all of it.
I agree with Cog
I like FFVII
XD
I'm saying that FF4 has more attention
And I don't understand the lack of interest in VIII
I dislike VIII
and VII was very good
FF7..never played
I pronounce it like "F-oh-ih-ss-th-ee-b-eh-ss-t-p-oh-n-ee"
FF6 SNES > FF6a
Spongebob Squarepants still airs regularly on Nickalodeon
I don't have a SNES
Veen over this.
*Been
which I care more about than the music
which is still good anyway
I wish they'd release it on the VC
Not only is SBSP nostalgic for me, but I still like i---well, I like seasons 1-3.
same
I'd buy it instantly
I have I on the VC
if I still had my wii
I'd buy chrono trigger on the VC
I want it
http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2011/06/bt-comcast-mr-album/
mmmmmmmmmk
...
I am dumb. very very dumb.
Ponies.
Oh.
...I tried.
I did some kind of RP hours ago and decided to actually log the thing.
Wouldn't the right thing be to tell Vicky the truth, that you don't want to be her friend, rather than making her WANT TO KILL YOU?
another I'd buy would be bit trip runner
m....k
but now that a bit trip collection has been annouced for the 3ds I'm content
I like Bit Trip Fate
This rp involved um...
I can't afford a 3DS or I'd have no complaints. XD
XD
*of
I could get Link's Awakening DX again. <3
...
6I have my Skype on.
which reminds me, i need to download that
?
I'm trying my hardest not to say shipping yet I just did right there.
Oh.
k...?
Hurray!
02Nickalert much?
...how're you dumb..?
02Oh Chrono Cross.
Now I can't um....
02And yes With me (@Ihrida)
ponies!
Oh
Okay

I just plugged it in
XD
Nah.

He just sat there as Vicky died. Coolio.
02Warning, my WINternetz may stop our plans
6And last night's stream.
/me doesn't follow...*
02(aka: Disconnection every 10 secs)
And now I went a couple steps up the creepy ladder.
I have no other interest in the PS3... xD
Well
The possible re-release of FFVII
I saw something about that recently
I need a stiff drink.
I lost interest in the PS3 when it lost its origional features
And to play my PSP's old PS1 games
6NewDCD
6He's the usual streamer.
...
...right
k then
4And usual streamer
Well, this did give me an idea. 20 questions?
woah i remember this
nah thanks
oh. okay.
FFVII is actually quite good
That was all I used my PSP for in its later years
Hahaha
FFVII, FFVIII, and FFTactics
? ? ? ? ? ?
And now you're down six more.
/brick'd
FFVI is the best one... XD
yup
/me just got banished
Only problem is
It came out on the SNES
Palkia, Dialga, or Giratina?
Giratina
giratina
6palkia
6She is, IIRC
6no in all seriousness, giratina
6i just wanted to be diiferent :>
I was gonna say bad things about Palkia
whooooo
ok, 4 Giratina, 1 palkia and one dialga xD

/me shot
Gira
:3
lol yup

/me hides
10Hi Newberry, long time no talk
All villians have this certain attractiveness about them.
Maybe celestia kept moving 'the sun' in the way to burn up the metors as they got close
All attractive traits.
14Yes, same to you
12Danny~
This song uses the F-bomb a bit too much for my liking
and hey
14I've been quite busy, but things have settled down a lot now
10What have you been up to?
I've been busy too
10Oh
Books - silence - Twilight does not approve.
12his entry hmm? ;3
I like books

Never watched that.
12well
14I've been working on school applications and autiditons and then band then finals, then went out of town and it's been reallly busy :/
you guys
Well technically, I'd need to be banished into the moon to prevent my powers from just wisking me back, it would certainly explain why I wouldn't be able to escape until the alinging of four specific stars some 1000 years later would be my only means of escaping
we should edit the team america
vid
I watched it with Yaridovich
12depending on how Skyward Sword is, this may only happen one more time ;-;
and when there's the whole silence during the Books part
suddenly HUGE OBJECTION OUT OF NOWHERE
OBJECTION
xD
What's the address for mIRC for Mibbit?
For me to have been trapped on the surface would also have to mean I had been weakened to such a point that I was unable to return myself until 1000 years later with the aid of said stars.

4Hm hes a hard one
Even she cannot handle it
I remember when I used to stream.
OH
BOOM 3
4And then he died
Apple BOOM 3
No. Can't do that. Doom and Ponies just don't mix.
(Apple) Bloom 3
4Will this mean that you won't be able to mod and stream much longer, man?
Even trying makes my brain recoil in horror.
hey mine worked!
DO IT
6Oh, no, I'll be fine.
6I use a cafe wifi, remember?
It was glorious.
:D
...
we all do
6I mean things we just generally don't want, dari.
I hope you never gain the powers to do that in RL retsa
Ok.
I was quoting Doom
Really? You guys must have really boring dreams.
no kidding
Nightboomfer... you can't quote Doom. There's no dialogue there.
No, just less horrifying dreams.
The Doom Comic I mean
It wasn't that horrifying.
Ahh.
YOU ARE HUGE
Ponify C&C

Retsa is an awful person.

Omnious chanting != Muslim prayers
I'm not surprised though, and whoever made the song shouldn't be either.
Me too
And World of Warcraft, E.V.E. Online
Muslim Prayers != Evil
May I ask why?
Lol Night.
2LOL
It's called a joke.
You're making my think of Pinkie on a sugar rush with that.
Being in a country with a sizable Muslim population and receiving channels from a Muslim country, I have heard and see those a lot of times
NOTHING EVIL.
Pinkie is always on a sugar rush.
Unless you are those "MUSLIM is EVUL! ALLAH is THE DEVIL!" types

Pinkie Pie in the streets of NYC.
Pinkie Pie on cocaine... reality would collapse
Ponify C&C
Pinkie Pie on crack would ensue not only the destruction of our world, but the creation of an entire DIMENSION.
Don't be silly Games4me. Animated characters are hard-wired to avoid drugs.
OH I KNOW, PONIFY X-COM
OUR
DIMENSION.

Not all of them.
X-COM!

A pony dimension?
Any time they even see the things, they're forced to come to gether in a nonsensical PSA to denounce the things.
Only the ones made for kids.
No, our dimension.

In shelter 17, we must rely on the one free puppy
Hi
I haven't played any of those games D:
hi
Why?
Its RE5 with COOP
CO-OP > EVERYTHING ELSE
oh, well okay
RE5 was shit, it's back to the same nonsense that made RE 1-3 bad
if you think that way, sure
RE4 was okay by my book
RE5 = RE4 With Co-op
Not even close mate.
03and I need a screwdriver that can open GB games
RE5 is bad how?
If we have ponies that control the sun and moon, are there ponies that control galaxies?
