IT'S RARITY
Wait, wasn't Black Dynamyte the one with B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D.?
Horses are faster than trucks
I still haven't seen feldmarschalk Von Rommel
he's joking pinkie i think
It lives in your nightmares?
g3 is that ghastly crap
It was daring do in disguise. She's spying Indiana Jones so she could copy those moves
Hey. I'm havin trouble with my stream freezing rather often. I've refreshed more than enough times. What do?
hey is there a list of all the symbols somewhere :P I was trying to figure them outbefore and I got kicked :P
yes it is!!! discord must have came again...
rarity is waaaaay hotter that that thing
I see poni uploading on youtube or something
g3.5 is the continuation by a different set of pople I think
And Eddy Murphy?
Oh god, why did I start thinking about Turkish Star Wars upon hearing the music. :(
and g3.6 is newborn cuties
dun dun dun dun, dun dun duuun!
ponies are faster then trucks
hey everypony
WHY
hey polaris

Black Dynamite is the film with Black Dynamite.
Faster than 1930s trucks

dis part is classic

Obviously it has more horsepower
You missed it
Sounds legit.
Rainbow Dash would get the ark back in ten seconds flat.

*guiles music plays*
that was something els
g3.6 doesn't exist, and FIM couldn't get 20% cooler
YOU SO RIGHTEOUS BLACK DYNAMITE

There was a G3.7, but it was never released since it caused instant death and all other episodes of it were sent to the moon
Sweet indiana jones!
Look at your truck, now back to me, I'm on a horse

The internet needs a sarcasm font

Caramel as that guy on screen now
HOOOOOONK
Pinkie was going to be a pegasi and fluttershy was going to be a earth pony

i just dcant remember
John Rhys-Davies

So much interesting trivia here
He played Gimli
diddutz: failed to get idol, going after the ten commandments, egypt, nazis, and some thing else I don't know about
secks time
YAY!;)
It's effective...
Right now, I feel the urge to just summon a pony from nowhere and snuggul with eet :3
LOL
He was also in that Jack the Ripper game
that lady = rarity
The ark = Sapphire Statue
Watch out Indy!
XD
towell = towell
Spike is Kagome's mother?
RAAAAAA

Alright, lets get this out of the way. Meanwhile, is it or is it not medical related?
I wanna snuggle with ponies
I said RAAAAAAAAAAAA

did he really play Gimli?
It is absolutely medical related.
He said WAAAAHHHH
Again, this musical theme

Hello SuperBrony64.
rarity and daring do...

Deleted scene: Indiana Jones points at his dick.

Indy is baby!
She was asked to include sweetie belle and Scootaloo

Daring do is hamtaro

Indie's HP: 10
Elbow fetish
lol D:
Even if you can't SEE it, you can tell by the voice.
Hi SuperBrony64, your 64 is showing
Eeyup
points to his junk
Oh I saw that in South Park!
These fucking hypocrtis. These action hereos do not show the slightest sign of pain while fighting, and then as soon as a woman touches them, they whimper
LOL
:d
10,02Dken2021: D:
it is movie night SB
yea
:S
*points to dick*
i guess i never paid enough attention to the voice
And Lauren thought the CCC should have had a spin off show
here
Ok the history of seaponies goes as follows : In the near future FiM will include seaponies and they will be awesome. Bronys will invent timetravel and in an atempt to make earth more like equestria, wipe out dinosaurs and spread the genetic blueprints for ponies and seaponies. those will then in the future past inspire thecreators of MLP.
:D
11,01Hi SB64.
<3
/me covers his 64

I imagine it's the adrenaline talking during fights.
Lambo: it's adrenaline

Paradox Loop achieved

you need to go to the doctor Meanwhile ~
Okay, I sleep now.
No, it is "I want the lady to lay me."

And you're upset because some guy you hate got 1 million bucks while you got Roids
Meanwhile: wash with warm soapy water gently and pat dry. try to keep it aired out
Hush now quiet now

A show staring the CCC would have been amusing
Her kiss killed him

What was that fire?
It's time to go to bed

WHAT'S IN THE BOX
The ark doesn't like swastikas
God hates nazis
burn baby burn.
Indy jones got an amulet, the place gets burnt down, bitch is useless and gets him almost killed twice, he finds snakes, and my ropesnake, gets the staffm finds the ark and you get the point
If coincidentally someone I hate got a million $ I'd kill them.
My connection just dropped, and now I can't even use my name anymore :[
Rats have ships
like I said, god does not like being in a nazibox
it was the fire of ominous foreshadowing
rats OWN ships
Indy's hp: 100

dammit story
i love how no one notices him
Elation turned into crushing despair in a second as Dash’s jaw fell open, along with everypony else’s. This was it, she realized - this was how it would end. And the worse feeling of all was that if the other pony had no qualms about dropping a thousand bits on an auction, then Dash never stood a chance from the beginning. Even Rarity was surprised; few residents of Ponyville had that kind of coin to drop and she could not imagine any of th
in the year 1936 they only had parts of europe
WALL OF TEXT, GO!
"Can you think inside the chimney?"

Wait, did they just say that and I missed it, or is that from somewhere else, owlicious?

By poo
they did nazi this com- oh.
Alright I admit that was stupid. I'm sorry
Tauen
well it's a little difficult
Das boot
I believe black ponies are zebras
:)
Indy can breathe underwater
Das Boot crossover
Tauchen !
There were plans for an episode centered around Big Macintosh. The episode was supposed to have little dialogue coming from the star character. However, it was dropped for a probable number of reasons (namely, that silence can get very boring).
this music makes anything interesting and dramatic
DAMN he can hold his breath!
dat boot
Tauchen das Uboot
y
:P
oh.... yea
you go ahead and do that
Twilight-Sparkle: darth vader

xD
just in CASE u forgot we are dealing with NAZIS
but yeah, if that was the case we'd all have 'roids.
heres the FLAG again
lol
It could've worked. They did a whole episode of Dexter's Laboratory with only two lines of dialogue in it.
they were black, skrmshssh
Maybe it's all secretly and erased from history
i whould play it when i walk to make the day epic
this is better, you will watch pony later
Nazis are magic
lololol :D
okay, moving on bc this is killing the chat
not the litteral color, but race
Indy held it up.
Indiana Jones can beat up Chuck Norris with his mind
Amlado fromage
i somehow wonder wether the sole reason that Indiana jones got so popular was the ammount of nazi symbolism in it :P
I heard Faust got criticized for racism for that and it was the biggest bs ever
05,15why...why are we talking about roids
Dexter's Lab was a genius show, but it also wasn't totally supposed to be marketed to little girls.
stealth increased to 91
Yay for swastika, enen in ye'toilet!
Or how ever that line went
But that was back then.... people want so much nowadays...
Meh

Because I refuse to accept Cancer as an answer
why not?
Germans are very strict
of course, help hammer in the point with the sudden german
he is retarded
Gentlemen
HELL yea
If you really listen for it, there's actually a pretty big difference between a "german" accent, and a "nazi" accent.
aww, second try...
but I think there isn't much left so maybe I'll watch it to the end
those are the times
pwned that pony

And it won't even allow me to SEE the email.
honestly, fluttershy's current level of assertiveness post-episodes.
yesh
lots of 2's
anything happening or are we concentrating on ze ponies?
;)
Photo Finish is best guest character in my book. So much eccentric energy
Spike, tough love baby
One would not courouse for such a terrible remark
elvis costume?
ok im back
I loved that outfit idk why photo didnt
baby blue saphires!
and then Elvis
the mayans obviously predicted 2012 to be the year of games
Stupid Ad
She looks so cute

Love is strong with this one : |
It's the Elivis outfit
00,03>little ponies
Jim: GW2 for the win, i reallly hope i get into beta, although i cant say if i do :S
seems a lot like her assertiveness in certain episodes like Dragonshy or Stare Master
doctor whooves
Why? What games are coming out?
Only ponies! :3

Silently judging you

Luna is not a sadsack, she's not evil, she's just... slightly a more muted, non-evil version of her evil personality
I wonder if HL2 episode 3 is finally going to be released this year
EspyLacopa yep but is kinda hard to do that in chat don't you think ?
Would you kindly go get stepped on by a Bigdaddy or something

lolz the firt pony fic i read(i'm still reading ._.) was the ballad of twilight sparkle
ujelly?
and Berry Punch
Only once so far.
BLUE SNOWBALLS?
Fuuuuuu!
Filly is girl
I've never read fanfics until this show came, how odd
Bonbon probably has multiple sisters each with the same cutie mark
Spoiler: Bon-Bon had a new voice in the most recent episode
wait, that was a continuation on bob bon's voice!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: At least it wasn't Cupcakes.
NO! Fluttershy is worst pony
That was the best picture

DA MAGICKZ
Cream was soothing Rain thankyou for asking.
o..o
i also prefer that bon bon voice
wat ep is this??
Glomp is like a hug-tackle-slam, right?
You would think she would be well known for fucking saving the world and Princess luna
dat cult of personality
Or Spiderses.
read past sins, its worth it

Fluttershy is cool...but Twilight and Pinkie are awesome :)

there are lots more girls than boys in equestria, something i noticed
thats not for kids
This episode. . .imagine if New Fluttershy was there.

Know that if I feel worse in the morning otakon the doctor is going to have to wait, because I'm going to come over and crack you in two like a fortune cookie.

no that I hate fluttershy or anything :$
I'm still under the impression that Bon Bon's cutie marks are actually lozenges, and the's a Voice Actress for MLP's biggest hit, My Little Human
true :O
o...o...am i missing anything
Trixie is the best pony, and Fluttershy is the worst
ballad of twilight sparkle was like the first thing i read i was cracking up like a maniac the whole time and now i like trixie O_o
<.< Why did no one ever find out luna was freed?
Wait for it...

A drug cartel with a samuri's sword.
FUCKING AD
Katana and a wakizashi.
My money's on the guy with the sword that won't break.
Cynder yelled
Gilda is a bitch, a bully, and a thief.
We have the technology

Poor quality katana is worst katana
"Root"? Like "Prick"?
DUN DUN DUN DUNDUNDUNNN
Damn add, during a machete fight,,
machette u need to hold one backwards
though he is good when the movie is purposefully bad
this would probably be a whole lot cooler if both actors weren't so god damn old and fat.
But i COULD forgive gilda
cheap ass katana
I know right
one hand now
thats it im buying this movie later
a segal fight that he hasn't won in 5 seconds?
Is this the first time Segal played a villain?
better defense
Only selling them together? As the three pack?
Use the other hand to cast spells!
this is too epic not to own
I could forgive Trixie before Gilda.
possibly
Meanie vs Goodie. GO goodie
Noo
im back
I don't even care about Gilda.
Trixie was just a boaster
I dont want another dumb chop chop, already have him and his counterpart
Dat asian
Trixie puts on a show for her livelihood.
MACHETE
Gilda was just mean.
oh I'm not selling it
Trixie was just a showoff and thats all
NOOOOOOO
Dammiy

Gilda is just that way naturalluy

are they rare?
:D
What a twist
Stabby stabby.
get owned
All of a sudden, Trolled
Gilda was cool! But we all know why not that many people like her :D
Cant find a stupid eruptor anywhere
If Gilda did come back in a future episode a different griffon, would she be forgiven?
No
pwned
staby staby
like a boss
He got own'd badly
like a baws
i wanted to see a ks .-.
But still
Que Puto?
the rare stuff is the skylanders posters
buffering... it will find the most exciting parts, EVERYTIME!
= fuck
Well played... Lets continue
tough guy!
Trixie was a stupid arrogant bitch, and I really don't understand why people like that about her.
Is that supposed to hurt?
Seagull is atually a Highlander.
Staeb staeb
no
not a 1up was given
STabbed through the guy, this is nothing.
but lol
He, He just got stabbed...
That come with the game?
I really have to wonder how Rainbow became friends with her
Jim: it should hurt
you take too long to die
RaveBrony, I like her. And I do feel sorry for her for losing what was probably her only friend
Get stabbed. Ignore. What?
no
But he's acting like it doesn't
I was going to stab you, butt fuck it
lol
yelling is for the weak!
Didnt think so
I thought he was saying "What a bitch"
Now that is badass
ouch
LIKE A SAMURAI
We're bronies, if a villan changed of course we'd accept them.

Seppuku

Aircrafter: I was not aware.
Don't you remember? Pinkie is preten ding to bescared ffrom the beginning. She mentions it later

1 bushel of asparagus = 1 bit. 3 tomatoes = 1-2 bits. 1 cherry = 2 bits. How does economy even work in ponyville?

Dark_Horst, they seemed to have loads of them in Dodge Junction
The Famine hit Ponyville pretty hard.
angel is a pilock
Hotpotat0: maybe she works as a veternarian part-time
I have to paraphrase Spoony here. Flutterhshy is one heartbreak away from becoming the chick from "Audition".
Goats are canon
Lol maybe
rainbow works for weather
rarity is a designer
angels mad bro.
That's not how it works mr. cherry merchant
ok
DICK

Lol they have no jobs... except AJ...
twilight probably has an allowance
fuck angel
DAMMIT ANGEL.
Rarity earns her by designing clothes

rainbow dash works on weather

Rare: as i said, frontier import
ANGLE IS A BITCH
spolied asshole
Just odn't mention the cherry.
1 cherry = 2 bits and 3 tomotoes = 1 bit?
applejack has the farm
yes, yes you are.. but an adorable one
seriously, did Flutters forget the stare
Angel, you Bastard.
My little... goat... ... ... something is... ... milk?
Name it: NOT A COCK SALAD
Bits logic
Rarity has her boutique, Applejack works the farm, Pinkie works at Sugarcube Corner.
spoiled little shit
SOMEONE MAKE A GAME ON KILLING ANGLE
Yes you are Fluttershy.
