03[17:51] <TimothyA> because you only get 2-3 years for rape, and 20+ years for pirating some music
/me screenshots, saves as yaoifangirlsinanutshell.jpg
13the truth comes out~

That is impressive, Saturn
Saturn thats a little harsh
14msn, y u not send messages
14:(
12msn isn't working for me

mine are completely hiddne
08,01but a lot of people don't
14I can't even see some of the users sometimes
hidden*
14what the heck is going on
12I even downloaded an odler version thanks to drf
12but even that isn't working
\
14maybe I should download the newest version
12NOPE
14I'm fine with the 2009 version
14xD
08,01completely legitimate
an unfortunate amount of people just arnt aware of everything that can be got for free
Saturn: yes it is
12but my computer doesn't open it
08,01sagas: how?
12something about
08,01it's publically available info
Saturn no its not, WHOIS lookups are free and legal information you put up
sag*
sagas*
12"this application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem"
12I have tried reinstalling
124 times
you CHOOSe to put it up, and you can easily have it hidden
12yeah I have
Oh hey, it works for Saturn.
12theres some CLEAN Repair thing
12not sure how legit that is
but that was publicly available in all likelihood
is this Brian May?
08,01Chrysalis: see, that's the problem right there
08,01it's not the looking up, it's that this happens in the first place
12but I got that working
There's nothing wrong with stalking. Unless you get caught.
08,01"online privacy" is an oxymoron.
wtf
you're kidding me
12when I got rid of EW mcafee
03Soital
03LOL
12whats the point if its just msn not working
12XD
good point RX-78_SweetieBot
03because
Saturn: um... you might want to stow that
03your computer is still f***ed up
yes i might have a job
12LOL
03you just happened to get it to not break for like 10 seconds
03:P
This is why I never want to piss Saturn off
03hmm
Saturn: that topic, just move on.
08,01otakon: it's an important topic, i think
03do I want a Lemmings character or a supernova for my avatar picture
That is one resiliant goblin
Saturn: not for here
08,01i'm a firm advocate of online privacy
08,01otakon: i'm sorry, but are you telling me how to do my duties as a mod?
Spam that 1 key!
08,01okay, maybe that was unfair
08,01but i would like to know why you think it's an inapproprate topic in here
Saturn: I mean I read it wrong.
Saturn has never been known for being particularly appropriate anyway.
Saturn: still, like politics and religion let's leave it be eh?
darn
08,01i'm always appropriate in here, in accordance with our rules
08,01otakon: well, i disagree with you there
08,01just because something's contraversial doesn't mean we shouldn't talk abotu it
You get kinda pervy, tbh.
08,01Meanwhile: not really. i make innuendous jokes a lot, but that's different.
Lemmings
:P
lol
13Why is Optimus Prime in the list of "people you should know" on my FB
How.

O__O

03*LOL
13pff
13i was paranoid before it was cool
14uhm
I noticed.
14I'm getting annoyed
14I'm on the TST forums
Saturn youd also have a reason not to do it
the poor guys on mac
14but for some reason it keeps logging me out
14:|
hes suffered enough
^
06there oo
05is dangerous
03for mine it's a 1, for yours it's a 10 etc
13it's always cool
06it's like
08,01Wrek: when someone exposes their OS as, say, WinXP...
13gives you lots and lots and lots of ways to doubt yourself in every way
13.w.
05Saturn: good point
06how many trophies you have. it goes up as you collect them
12LMAO
08,01Wrek: it's just helpful to an attacker
12its K
12same
02.w.
06i have no idea how it actually works
14xD
03o.o
03well
13rain rain~<3
I feel less safe now
03you have way more than 10 trophies? LOL
06LOL well yes, it doesn't increase every troph
08,01if you're really paranoid
Uh, I like to use the one I have for skype :3
06it takes more and more the higher you get, like a korean f2p mmo!
/me hides
08,01to be honest, it's more relevant to servers
Use piglatin?
how do you do that Saturn
Want me to upload a headshot of the image?
If you're really really paranoid go live in a cave and avoid contact with anyone.
it'll only take a couple minutes.
03that's odd
02*WB03(Light_Latias03)02WB* - <Light_Latias> 12Chaos, panic, and disorder. My work here is done~
13i live in a house and avoid contact with people, does that count?
03as I literally have exactly one trophy
03and it's a bronze one
08,01it may vary for other clients
03I got PSN to work and such, go add me

Nothing for me either.
i have heard this song befor

13I don't have to use that anymore but I think that's how I originally fixed MSN a few years back when it wouldn't work for ages o.o
Hey isn't Alien on later?
Least you can sleep. =__=
yes
Wait I think they are showing aliens not alien
No Aliens is tommorow.
It's trilogy season, 3 movies over 3 nights each week.
<Gil> 10 hours sleep is prity good, i dont see why you would be dissapointed with it
This week, Alien, Aliens, and Alien3.
wohoo Aliens
05but not alien 4
\m/
05cause alien 4 sucked
lol
D'oh, i missed "Alien":/
12but they're backed p on my pendrive
Just like there's no 4th Indiana Jones movie.
When was Alien on?
Alien hasn't shown yet.
12so evenm though I've uninstalled everything
12its still there
AvP does not count
lol
11,01It's name.
05AvP isnt toooooo bad
IT IS NAME!
05its neat fight scene action for 1½ hours
Not tooooo bad but not as good as any of it's source material.
05dont expect more of the AvP movies than they really are
Still though, between Alien or AvP, I would rather watch Alien.
05i kidna liked the latest one
^LOl
Why is there a movie tonight?
8,6Alien
8,6because we feel like it :p
oh yeah trilogy
Alien? tonight? I didn't missed it? :)

alienz
GODDAMMIT I CRAVE PIZZA!
brb gonna ask Craig if he wants to split a pie
Facehuggers mutate into Praetorian facehuggers which can then mutate into a Queen from impregnation in a host.
And I think the Praetorian alien caste can mutate into a Queen with the absense of one.
I just pulled the elastic string out of me underwear *me gutsa*
is there actually a Xenomorph-Pony-Crossover?
13so I'm eating that outdated pasta we have

05"untill the fillies round up at me"
Goodbye people
08,01decisions, decisions
Saturn!
Saturn yes?
08,01i'm look at postgraduate study programmes
Go ahead Saturn
Saturn ok....
Saturn
08,01i'm really interested in the way programming is taught in to kids
Saturn ^-^ it suits you :3
08,01and how we can get schools to churn out more competent programmers
/me 13hopes saturn isn't talking about american schooling cause that's a lost cause
08,01and how to invent programming languages that facilitate an easier way of creating programs, but for beginners and professionals
American education, oxymoron amiright.
lol
08,01GilDash: i know that, let me explain the problem
05actualyl make BASIC fun saturn?
13stalking is bad mmkay?
05ok
:D
05wish me luck
how do they teach it now Saturn
A lot of people I know from my grade don't have any manners. I really hate when people don't have manners.
08,01which is largely the case now
08,01panda: i'm saying it should be just as important as physics or chemistry, which are also electives at most school
08,01yes?
08,01that's me
DUN DUN DUUN!
13saturn might be okay with it, but i'm not
08,01bet you don't know my middle name
13don't be spreading personal information here
08,01sagas: i'm pretty open
ive noticed
no it's not
a'wwww
Saturn: :'( How?
13sagas: Again, Saturn may be okay with it, I am not. Stop spreading personal information.
awww now you made me sad :'(
Is it me or is that boss dropping corpses?
okay
and COME ON I CALL HACKS!
08,01BlazeAngel: no time, unfortunately
08,01anyhoos, as i was saying
Saturn: Jah, tis be okay
all those damage damage fields taking up 90% of the battlefield
it's bull
08,01one option would be to get a Teaching Diploma and become a teacher
08,01i'd do that for a while, being on the front lines as it were
08,01get some real experience with it
08,01unfortunately, this isn't very well paid
13on top of his license to kill
oh my
NO BUFFER!
13you can't license silly
13that would be..
/me 13lowers her glasses
13silly
http://puu.sh/AieG
classes r hawt
08,01aye
I'm calling it
someone goes evil
08,01but, then again, i'm not sure how beneficial that'd be to my goals
08,01another option is to do a Masters in Education
08,01then maybe a PhD in Education
08,01that'd be 2 or 3 years
The dr......Grab a TARDIS and star traveling...
08,01then after that, do a PhD full time
08,01in fact, thinking about it, that's a really good option
02Nini everyone~

ouyga ouga whatta whatta
08,01panda: teaching diploma -> work as a teacher for 2 years while doing a part-time Masters in Education -> work a further 2 or 3 years as a teacher, maybe dabble in education politics -> do full time PhD in CS relating to programming languages

12USJ?
03yeah
12lawl
No no no I stole his name for a sec
08,01fork() and exec() is a retarded way of goign about spawning processes
Mine
Saturn well exec is good but fork? XD
/me nods at Saturn, then pauses and shrugs.
Meh, i like fork
12ah
/me sings
get to fork all the programs
UM
At the bottom of the user list
Volbeat is best rockabilly band.
08,01instead of fork(), there should be something like emptyprocess()
08,01does the same thing, but has an implicit exec()
08,01and blocks until it can exec()
I think I'm getting my rule books mixed up, is roleplaying allowed?
They should make a special room just for roleplaying.
Whos streaming next?
YEAH
08,01Iron_Edge: fork() duplicates the currect process, copies the memory, and retains all open file pointers
metaphor*
icebeauti that would be good
Excessive? I can deal with that.
awww I missed Wrek's stream :(
I just came up with that :)
Saturn: Ok now I see. But whats an excecs then?
GoodbyeWrekHaveANiceDay:)

Good
superdestructor
Good Idea
fluttershy approves of this movie aparrantly
cool
00,10Fluttershy does not beling in this movie.
I thought most people like to stop the Alien series at Aliens, not Alien 3
Stream is a bit laggy for me
00,10George taki would be ok though
I never noticed the dipping birds in the intro before
:/
00,10this is Directors cut
cool
"watch out for the headhumpers gordon."
great
Fluttershy loves animals.
6_9
even aliens
If the Alien kills Fluttershy, we riot
why does he have a mug of coffie next to him ig he's wearing a helmet.
/me pushes random buttons
My ears did not like that scene
silly man
Oh crap, Aliens.
are ou sure
do the aliens drink coffie?
yes
welll mabe
Well, one of those movies. :P
Even Aliens needs coffein sometimes...
Ooooh, good movies!
BOO

Oh, lord, how old is that cigarette?
KITTY!

That cat is best pony
00,10keep in mind this movie was made in 1979
Ty :3
O.o
/me pulls up a recliner
This is the second scariest movie ever made
Me too.
11,01 Sound is off.
Evening, everyone.
Are you an alien?
Nice to see you all enjoying the classics.
I've heard bad things about it, but I want to watch it anyway.
13is that an alien?
Son, you gota condition.
13is that an alien?
The Thing can be kinda scary
no.
beep beep beep chucka chucka chucka
PROTIP: The room is an alien
pretty lights
Tat room confuzzels me
Over 10 megabytes of memory.
He is using a computer in the COMPUTER ROOM
Steel_Thunder: I thought the only thing The Thing had going for it was the special effects. I thought the rest of it was pretty ridiculous
THE MATRIX..
oh wait nvm
not me
dem computers from the future
Why are we running Winux 1995?
How come we don't have computer rigs like this?
11,01Yes.
YES I'M BACK IN TIME!
11,01I missed VioletVanila's stream. I am sad :<
This was the first R-rated movie I ever saw in the theaters.
this i R?
cool
I R this~
00,10this is the first one Alien.
depends, was this movie made in the 70s?
no he dont die first, actually he is pretty kewl
1979
2000 i think
Somewhere in the 79's
Indoor voice~
also, this movie STILL LOOKS GOOD
Know-it-all androids >,>
Stupid freaking contract.
2000 i think
I have not
I haven't seen it
Ush I hit the 9 by accident ?\>_<
/me 11,01shares
But...
contract=death
I have never seen it all the way through
.....sigh *facehoof*
00,10some how they turnd off the sound of the computers
where is steel thunder?
Then suddenly HALE 9000
To be fair, though, I believe sailors are obligated to render assistance unless they themselves would be put in peril.
Eh, Avatar had faster fluidity, this is more suspenseful
i think everyone has seen this movie :D
I hated Avatar
Which one?
witch 1
once you get past the cat people it's just boring
alien, this movie
00,10ofcorse,
I though Avatar was pretty average. Entertaining, but average
cool
as long as Avatar was, it still felt like there were holes and that it was a bit rushed
Avatar was pretty but had kind of a weak plot in retrospect.
Avatar was boss in cinemas but on a tv it was crappy
Aww
11,01Alien 3.
Resurrection doesnt exist >_<
3, Resurrection never happened
Avatar looks really weird at 60 fps.
I heard that most people stop at the second movie
its a good stopping point anyway
00,10Resarection never happend
Just watch the first two movies and forget that anything else was ever made.
Just the little part?
Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, and the AvP movies do not exist
I find it hilarious that most spaceship engines you see are just lights instead of actual pyrotechnics
like Pretator 1 was the only good one
Sadly the first Aliens movie I ever saw was Ressurrection and I hated it
the best movie from alien is alien 2, in my opinion
I think i have not seen ressurection
is the most i liked it
yeah, call me uncultured but Alien is 80% buildup
13Randomnerd: no no that was the ship in Alien
they press r twice
little
I walked into that one...
:~$
Good old Vector Computer Graphics, surely this is the future:)
:P
00,10demn navigation christmass lights
lol
Look at them buttons
xDDDD :D

I still think vector graphics look like The Future(TM)
Hmm, them landing a spaceship reminds me of the time I landed planes perfectly in Wings of Prey
why does the future have somany buttons
13how do you confuse us.... one of us types in a pretty pastel color, and the other streams anime from time to time
lol
02Nice!
No, I mean just the words, not the people
OH NO!
00,10great landing
derp, lets just ram the ship into the ground
/me 13waits for that to go over everyones heads
Painc!
lol

10 point landing
nuuuuuuuuu
Why a straight answer? Why not a homosexual answer?
I give that landing a 2 /10
Still I liked it
00,10did they land on a spike?

Pinkie "Would anyone care to join me in panicking? No, okay! ....AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!"

That's using Windux 95
They're*
13no duct tape on mars
oh
00,10nah win 3.1
Duct tape for Ducts. Makes Sense
13they forgot how to make it
linux/unix does not
I doubt they have MS DOS or something
Matrix
13sure, don't you see the demons?
HE CAN READ THE MATRIX NUMBERS
Run the debug program
Hes the chosen one! :O
This is The Matrix before The Matrix was The Matrix

let's go spaceeeeeeeeee
spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccccccceeeeeeee
02I think I played it too fast though
the only complaint I have about this movie really is that it takes a bit too long for the alien to show up
gptta gp tp s[ace
SPACEEEEEEEEEEEE
I dont know a single name of a single pony
00,10they landed

Nothing in this fandom should give me nightmares - but then again, I have already read [REDACTED]
03I have my GameCube at home
03I really just want to make the most of this thing
03XD
actually i saw a review he was apparently not even a clopper..
It sold for like 600
02I'm going into IT
03why?
Magnet gun is best gun

10Everyone wants to

Hi Everypony
03IT is awesome, that's why

PLEASE stop the talk of the plush. I already have nightmares

ppl on wcd might want one to rip SACDs
^
are you making things implode
?
Magnets - How do they work?
i want it for gloves.
Besides, apparently IT jobs pay pretty well.
10Not in America
some
03<junh1024-XD> ppl on wcd might want one to rip SACDs <- how do you rip SACDs on 4.11?
IT is a very broad field
xD
10IT is like, just a bit higher than working in fast food or grocery
can it run unsigned packages?
03no.
03you need CFW
03:P
Hugs
02eh, they make the most money in America
Hi Everypony
Tacos
03er
h-uh
Hm.
programming jobs play higher?
03PS3MFW requires the keys
03same keys that sacd-ripper needs
10Jun, yes
oh
03the reason 3.55 is the higest CFW
10BlueFlare
03is because 3.55 is the highest with leaked keys
03if someone leaked 4.11 keys, we could make 4.11 CFW
this gun is epic
Do you?
02Skylands, I'm in school for IT
02>.>
dentists and actuaries should make lots of money, too
Magnets are fun
10IT does not make the highest wage or salary
Huh...
That was weird
10I'll be using Jun's example
10Dentists make WAY more than a basic IT employee
Mear mortals can't handle that much wubs
DUDE
Ooh.
They're dentists.
11,01sagas: I know.
02IT makes about $20,000 - $150,000/year depending on the job.
02It’s a VERY broad category
Dat plan
"Broad" doesn't mean "rich"
the thing is, noone wants to be dentists, 'cuz customers don't like you
10^
and IT itself is very broad
I thought they were the same?
There's programmers, network admins, computer repairmen.
I know.
dentists also have one of the highest su*cide rates, apparently
S&D
actuaries are highly skilled in both maths & calc
err
stats & calc
brb guys
Oh, it came back.
BOOM
d:

That repair ability is pretty cool.
inb4 it's renamed to ICT
