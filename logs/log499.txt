I used to be fat, but then I started PTing
sagas: >supporting shipping
14oh please, I did that yesterday :(
Hi everypony! I found something out today, my town is so small, the town hooker is still a virgin. No joke. :|
/me runs
06no murders here
06nope
06none
13YAAAAAY
BlazeAngel: -___-
doesn't matter to me if people think I look disgusting
12;3
BlazeAngel, then she's not very good at her job
RX-78-SweetieBot: Im fine with shipping
lol
suddenly his ability to organise makes ALOT more sense
I used to be quite the round kid, until i entered puberty :3
GOD WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT VIDYA GAME?!
otakon: Killin
MahBoi777, are you proud of your rolls? Lol. How much do you weigh?
Well it looks like Diablo probably a shit ton of monster murdering.
08,01owlicious: open source projects mainly, but also some stuff hiring for companies in the past
13need fud
Where where?
03http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/koma-comic-strip-the-same-strategy-as-last-year-then.jpg
03XD
Why are we dicussing weight?
oh
No clue
But here we are
Springfield: three fitty
*fifty
8,6I declare that it is time for a glomp pile on Shizuka, anyone absent shall be punished
02LOL
13uh oh
/me glomps Shizuka
/me glomps Shizuka ...
/me glomps Shizuka
Shizuka: WAZZZZUUUUUUP
/me glomps Shizuka.
/me glomps Shizuka
/me turns around and glomps kirzstryfe
ATTACK!!!
03hm
I can get behind glomping Shizuka
/me glomps Shizuka, but is also drinking beer
03slightly random question:
Yeah, I wouldn't be able to carry you if you were injured. It would take two strong medics and a litter to lift you
/me glomps Shizuka
14lol
03do trophies auto-sync when you're signed into PSN?
/me then proceeds to glomp kirzstryfe
03like if I earn one while signed in
You're a burden in your current state, bro
14I remember when playing COD wasn't a joke
Do you have a rascal?
14memories~
Or some other kind of scooter?
/me glomps Shizuka
Springfield: LOL no:D
Springfield: youre a dick, bro
03also
03http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/koma-comic-strip-the-elder-scrolls.jpg
03:D
/me jumps late on the Shizuka glomp pile
06my favorite part is when they whine for them to change things, and when there's a slight change in the new cod they complain about that
02you've been playing with a Cod? D:
I walk like any normal person
How am I a dick?
Did you know there is A Le Mis fighter?
03hm
I'm being honest
06cod community PFFFFFFTHAHAHAHA confirmed for confusing
03apparently it's like
03"waiting for the sync something something"
13Cod is a fish and nothing more
sagas: it don't bother me lol
06and I think they synch
Sugar-coating things helps nobody
13>:/
MahBoi777: Twice my weight almost xD niiiice~
03well
Springfield: Your making a spectacle of his weight
But that's his choice to live his life how he wants
So?
03I disabled auto-sign in
06at least they seem to do for me
03because >hacked console
He brought it up
Lol
When I fell down all I do is watch Pinkie Pie and I feel better
MahBoi777: Its still not a nice thing to do
Om: YEAAAAH
03so when I sign in does it sync or do I have to like, actually go view trophies
/me glomps Shizuka a little on the late side.
what about weight?
Hey, panda.
It's quite a spectacle unto itself, sagas. :P
sagas: it's fiiiiiiine, I'm happy:D
06i think it should do automatically. i never wait for that dumb "synching trophies" bar to move
08,01Springfield: you're being disrespectful, even if you believe what you say is true
02dunno
03k
14I liked the first COD
03not that I really care about trophies
14buggy as hell, but still fun
/me 13is flat now..
03just curious
14and COD4
14<3
03and who knows how long this will work
13The fish had bugs in it? D:
/me 08,01pumps Shizuka up
/me repuffs Shizuka
/me glomps Shizuka anyway
03Sony will probably force more updates and block custom firmware or some crap XD
with?
lol
/me uses Shizuka as a rug
14xD
08,01Ninjazz: that's not dirty!
13misread firmware as fishware
sure
13I should sit down
08,01how was that dirty!
13:<
8,6lol
I'm in shape, round is a shape
06your head is full of fish
02fiskware

08,01:P
/me 08,01hugs Ninjazz
13your head is full of mess
13>:/
Anyone here play Diablo 3 on Hardcore? Server derped last night killing a bunch of HC characters apparently.
Ninjazz: You, are dirty in the head
13so much ping
06Not denying that~
Om: Shush. >.>
Brainleak
If he's happy the way he is, that's just fine
08,01Springfield: well, if he asks you to stop, then stop.
I wouldn't dare playing Diablo on hardcore
Ninjazz: no
Springfield: I appreciate your concern for my health though
02your head is full of brown stuff
/me runs
08,01or i shall swing the mighty hammer
/me yottabop Xanbreon
kirzstryfe: What?!!?!?
/me flips Espeon
tish tish~
its long, its big
/me lands on Xanbreon
and it hits hard
06Ta-da~
The mighty BANHAMMER!
/me opens the ping sound bar, emails a virus to Shizuka that plays the ping sound, over, and over, even when the computer is off.
8,6hammers are better when they can't see them coming
Ohnoes~
/me ejects his en bloc clip
Hammah
PING
05quiztime: what is the translated statement on the swedish coin, 1 krona?
/me gives Xelispeon and Xanbree party hats
Bah nvm
but then how do they see their name written on it
03but like
03http://i.imgur.com/bfzMB.jpg
03you know that's legit
I'm not using that name
03>no disc needed
03still has proper trophies and all
08,01Springfield: no, i'm just saying that if it bothers him and he asks you to stop, do so.
lol
03Now I need to do this for more games
08,01that is all
Yay party
14katamari?
12well that sucks
03yeah
14wasn't that a Nintendo game?
03I only own like
12no idea why its not working
03two PS3 games
kirzstryfe: I think its better when they see them coming and they whimper before it
03and LittleBigPlanet is stupid
03and requires a disc
03>_>
08,01BlazeAngel: *inside* of... eewww
03but Katamari can be converted to hard-drive only
03you need a hacked PS3 of course ;P
08,01BlazeAngel: i thought it was only Lyra who could do that
Oh god why
BlazeAngel: ewwww
THE HORROR!

06because it has all my pointless trophies and online game progress stuffs!
08,01i was tlaking to the guy who made That Lyra Plushie (tm) the other day, and i sent him that link. he didn't seem too amused; he really doesn't like the brony fandom, and made the plushie as a troll. i think it annoys him that we took it in our stride.
06but feel free to add Indefinatrix if you want anyway :P
BANG! Work da bolt

06i could rant for hours on it but i remember doing that in driving games
I like how the music ends and it's just the sounds of steel on flesh for a few seconds.

Who wants to go shooting with me?
02http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/video-game-memes-doesnt-matter-had-pikmin.png
08,01Chrysalis: that's true
06msn has been dropping messages for no reason for me for months so i use it as little as possible
mine are completely hiddne
08,01but a lot of people don't
14I can't even see some of the users sometimes
hidden*
08,01especially people who don't really know about it
14what the heck is going on
12I even downloaded an odler version thanks to drf
12but even that isn't working
08,01they just register their domain and have no idea
Springfield: Lol
\
12at least firefox is working now
14maybe I should download the newest version
14but I'm like NOPE
12NOPE
NewDCD is watching you: http://derpy.me/LIuCl
14I'm fine with the 2009 version
14xD
08,01sagas: it's totally not sketchy at all
06exchange mario with CoD and "more gold" or whatever it says with more explosions and it's more suitable~
12thats what I want!
08,01completely legitimate
an unfortunate amount of people just arnt aware of everything that can be got for free
12but my computer doesn't open it
08,01sagas: how?
12something about
08,01it's publically available info
sag*
sagas*
12"this application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem"
12I have tried reinstalling
RX-78-SweetieBot the old kamen rider series were kind of goofy wern't they
124 times
you CHOOSe to put it up, and you can easily have it hidden
13google that error message?
08,01there's absolutely nothing wrong with google stalking, in my opinion
12yeah I have
12theres some CLEAN Repair thing
jsut people dont actually look into everything thats involved with the internet
12not sure how legit that is
but that was publicly available in all likelihood
is this Brian May?
08,01Chrysalis: see, that's the problem right there
alexxm: not really any more than the current ones actually.
08,01it's not the looking up, it's that this happens in the first place
12It said the same exact thing for firefox
12but I got that working
WTF, searching for my username, result 3 is fimfiction
There's nothing wrong with stalking. Unless you get caught.
08,01"online privacy" is an oxymoron.
wtf
you're kidding me
12when I got rid of EW mcafee
03Soital
03just reinstall Windows already
03LOL
12whats the point if its just msn not working
12XD
good point RX-78_SweetieBot
not sure if im comfortable with this
03because
03your computer is still f***ed up
yes i might have a job
12LOL
03you just happened to get it to not break for like 10 seconds
03:P
alexxm: good for you! :)
08,01otakon: stow what?
/me hugs alexxm
03hmm
08,01oh sagas, i doubt you could do that <3
08,01otakon: it's an important topic, i think
03do I want a Lemmings character or a supernova for my avatar picture
That is one resiliant goblin
08,01i'm a firm advocate of online privacy
thanks otakon a cafe i gave my CV to called me back about it
If you look up my nickname, Google thinks that you can't spell.
/me hugs RainbowJack
08,01otakon: i'm sorry, but are you telling me how to do my duties as a mod?
Spam that 1 key!
if you look up my nickname, nobody knows how to spell owlowscious
08,01okay, maybe that was unfair
08,01but i would like to know why you think it's an inapproprate topic in here
otakon: That calls for a paddling
WHOIS sagas
GarrettBrony: you may never know
darn
GarrettBrony: you have to /whois for that
Wow, 3 searches on google and i found my address on google from my username
08,01i'm always appropriate in here, in accordance with our rules
08,01otakon: well, i disagree with you there
08,01just because something's contraversial doesn't mean we shouldn't talk abotu it
You get kinda pervy, tbh.
Guys, it's just a simple whois. No big deal.
08,01Meanwhile: not really. i make innuendous jokes a lot, but that's different.
Lemmings
:P
lol
13Why is Optimus Prime in the list of "people you should know" on my FB
How.
14o.o
06because facebook
03LMAO
holly shit! The /whois command is scarry

Seems harmless to me sagas
He kinda is.
13see kids
12you want to know whats funny
08,01sagas: CTCP VERSION is scarier
03and LOL paying for premium pictures
12this one person I never got along with
13this is why i paid extra to hide my domain info
/me sees nothing
06i might have broken everything as i try to accept it while appearing offline hopefully not
14OMG THUNDERS OUTSIDE
12in high school

03XD
08,01CTCP VERSION reply from sagas: lightIRC.com 1.2.3 Build 101, Feb 16 2012 10:26 on Mac OS 10.6.8
12its like are you that desperate for friends
In other news, now chat is paranoid.
...Yeah y'know that seems like a good investment.
06then I think it worked
O__O
08,01thanks to that, if i were a hacker, i'd now have an attack vector
03wait, what
I am? 6_9
03appearing offline what LL
03*LOL
13pff
13i was paranoid before it was cool
14uhm
THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP TELLING ME IM ON XP! :D
I noticed.
14I'm getting annoyed
facebook GOLD account!
so, what are the vulnerabilities on mac os 10.6.8? is there a mailing list?
14I'm on the TST forums
08,01this is why the server hides all your IPs
05because knowing your OS and the date
the poor guys on mac
14but for some reason it keeps logging me out
14:|
hes suffered enough
Dont worry Shizuka being paranoid was never cool
03also what's the little gold trophy thing
^
06there oo
05is dangerous
03for mine it's a 1, for yours it's a 10 etc
13it's always cool
alexxm: Oh so you use Virgin for you internet
13keeps you sharp
06it's like
08,01Wrek: when someone exposes their OS as, say, WinXP...
12ugh google why are you so useless
lol Shizuka is now Icebox
hows it dangerous Wrek
13gives you lots and lots and lots of ways to doubt yourself in every way
8,6DWR_Drawing, do you have an avatar you use regularly, or should I pull the one from your DA?
13Viri I misread your comment about thunder as "OMG TSUNDERES OUTSIDE"
yeah sagas
13.w.
06how many trophies you have. it goes up as you collect them
12LMAO
08,01Wrek: it's just helpful to an attacker
12its K
12same
02.w.
/me picks up Shizuka and walks her over to Wrek and then hugs both of them tightly
06i have no idea how it actually works
14xD
03o.o
Yeah. Because that's how I want to live, Shizuka.
03well
13rain rain~<3
I feel less safe now
03you have way more than 10 trophies? LOL
08,01if you want to be safe, spoof your real details
06LOL well yes, it doesn't increase every troph
08,01if you're really paranoid
Uh, I like to use the one I have for skype :3
06it takes more and more the higher you get, like a korean f2p mmo!
/me hides
08,01to be honest, it's more relevant to servers
Use piglatin?
Want me to upload a headshot of the image?
If you're really really paranoid go live in a cave and avoid contact with anyone.
it'll only take a couple minutes.
03that's odd
08,01alexxm: from my client i did /ctcp sagas version
13i live in a house and avoid contact with people, does that count?
03as I literally have exactly one trophy
03and it's a bronze one
03hi LL
08,01it may vary for other clients
03I got PSN to work and such, go add me
08,01(i use irssi)
/me runs
Barbetos|AtWork: of-yay ourse-cay
This counts as contact Shizu, so not really.
Shizuka: you too?
13see
8,6can you send me something over skype or through imgur? need a small picture I can toss on the newsletter
13now people understand
arbetos|AtWorkBay siay ightray
Om: Why do you use comcast? In Washington I think
13why i don't have a mic
02<%Espeon> it takes more and more the higher you get, like a korean f2p mmo! <- True Story

sagas: ._.
Shizuka: but it would be nice to actually TALK TO YOU once in a while...
oooh Shizuka has a twitter
8,6anytime within the next hour or so, so no rush
I'll do it via skype.
Best to get it out of the way now.
Om: The internet is a fun place, isnt it?
probably another Shizuka, it IS a pretty big internet.
13and now comes the stalking
Om: O_O
otakon: You are talking to her. Even if she answers maybe once every year.

I don't care much for facebook either
CrazyCherry: You pinged me first.
well that can't be good
Omg, what is this song? and by who??
O.o
Rain: no
or any other social site
Rain: it's Diablo 3
Rain: It's Diablo 3. So no. Not at all.
13Chrysalis: i appreciate your lightheartedness about it, but don't be so creepy
/me puts Meanwhile 's Face in Book
13or i will destroy you
ooooh
6makin breakfast
and hiya Rain
6late breakfast
/me hugs Rain
In fact it's very much the opposite of free.
8,6that never sticks Shizuka, and I can basically do the same stuff with +h :p
who the hell said it was Lemmings?
Well it is free if they have a pirated copy out yet...
so does diablo 3 get repititave
13what kind of breakfast? :D
hey RaveBrony!
alexxm: it can
Rain: I thought you were joking because of the ":3c" face.
Hiya MahBoi777! :D
13also thanks for reminding me how hungry I am
alexxm: it's kill, loot, sell, repeat ofc it does.
8,6D3 is great when you have people to play with and bullshit
hey Rain hows your day been
alexxm does a bear shit in the woods?
08,01i'm not too fussed about having my details available on line; in fact, i encourage the sharing of my contact details
alexxm, /every/ game gets boring if you play it enough
RaveBrony: how are you?:D
kirzstryfe: and the servers are working
6hash browns and frog-in-the-hole
/me hits Meanwhile 's face with a book and says '' now thats a Face Book''
good, alexxm
8,6it's more about the craziness that happens with the people you're playing with :)
08,01i think if someone wnats to contact me, they should be able to
MahBoi777: Good, and you?? :)
hey RaveBrony hows your day been
also, hello otakon
/me hugs otakon
6and chocolate milk
13frog-in-the-hole?
08,01but i advocate the choice of whether that should be the case or not
and I understand, Meanwhile :p
kirzstryfe: My enjoyment of a game should never be dependent on others
8,6and watching Midnight_Tempest pick up every piece of white loot that drops
14eat :D
RaveBrony: I'm doing awesome, excited
kirzstryfe: ya
Hiya alexxm, my day has been pretty good :P got ALOT done on my OC drawing :$ how about your day?
6basically
Yeah. That's kind of how this game I just bought is like.
Yeah Rain, sorry about that.
HIYA EVERYPONY
13OH wait, is that what we call Toad-in-the-hole here
8,6why not? it's great to play with other people
13xD
MahBoi777: For what?? :o
6you take a slice of bread, cut a hole in it
kirzstryfe theres always one
back at college RaveBrony
kirzstryfe: its awesome
Bronysith: One of these days you have to sort your caps out.
6put it on a buttered pan, pour scrambled egg in the hole
6cook
6profit
Meanwhile: WHAT CAPS
RaveBrony: goin to texas and Florida next month
13oh, nope xD
the reason i never finished Dead Island is one of the guys i played with looted everything
alexxm: Well that sounds like, fun :D
13thought you meant toad-in-the-hole
03inb4 take a box, cut a hole in the gox
03*box
Bronysith: seriously.
even if it was for a different class
Chrysalis: dead islands is terrible
8,6it's funny, if you drop white loot from your own bag and he's offscreen when you do, he'll stop to pick it up because he thinks it's a drop :3
Meanwhile: like this?
13sausage inside a yorkshire pudding
13:D
Bronysith: better.
MahBoi777: Lucky!! I would LOVE to go back to Florida....
03sausage is right
/me runs
sagas, some games are best with friends. If you refuse to play a game just because it is better with friends, then you need to learn how to have fun with friends
Bronysith its not, its just not what was advertised
its a fun game
kirzstryfe: You're evil. I like that.
RaveBrony: I've never been to Florida, I can't wait ^_^
Rain: Not better with friends, but requires friend to be fun
kirzstryfe is there bag limits?
MahBoi777: Where in Florida are you going? :3
MahBoi777: Its just some hot pininsual
farm some low level and drop the lame whites that drop early on so he has no space
13I want to say I suddenly have a craving for them but it'd sound dirty no matter how I worded it :<
brb guys gonna check out a review
o.o
Just watch out for the zombies in florida
03hah
I was JUSt listening to that song :D
13also
Pick a song!
scary
6I wish I could have yorkshire pudding more often
One does not simply pick a song.
13I've been craving corn on a cob for at least a year now
YES!
13still haven't had one
Oh Fallout 3
Yes.
whats it called RaveBrony
RaveBrony: ummmmmm, we're not sure where we'll be stayin just yet
INKSPOTS FTW!
sagas: Why did you look up my infromation anyway >_>
/me wants to set the world on fire
8,6there are, but he still picks them up :3
12tacos
Om: good, I need a sunburn
12NEED TACOS ;~;
13it be traditional to have them with Sunday dinner here every weekend, you be missing out D:
<3 old timey music!
alexxm: The one with "We Are Warriors" :D
Colourful in here today.
This other game I'm playing is kind of like Diablo, but it's less focused on hack n Slash and loot and more focused on magic. It's said this game is best when played with people who aren't very good at it.
MadSurge: not that old
8,6wait, MahBoi777, where in Florida?
MahBoi777: Oook, havent heard that often
Om: Because I could and you seemed like the one who would be most affected by it :D
yeah RaveBrony
13then again we haven't had a homemade sunday dinner at my house in years due to lack of time with my parents
MahBoi777: Oh, haha. Well hopefully it stays dry for you! :D
I'm back. :)
xD
wb GilDash
Shizuka is like, shy squared.
All that fire in the background.:D
13eating it at restaurants is fine too, I guess -w-
LoyalDash: it IS Hell
alexxm: Im not sure of the song name :P I know the song from a WoW vd i just watched :D
otakon: Oh...>_<
13QUIT TALKIN' ABOUT FOOD, YOU'RE MAKIN' ME HUNGRY
/me just wants to start a flame in your heart

alexxm: THE FUCK
After fallout equestria I can never think of fallout the same again.
alexxm: Wtf!?!
Or mlp for that matter
Thanks for that alexxm, not like I needed to sleep tonight anyway.
Barbetos|AtWork: goddammit that story made me teary eyed
8,6^5
alexxm: what a funny clown
8,6^2 is too low
/me just wants to be the love you love
/me quickly hugs GilDash "There, you got your poison. >_> Now stop spaming me with sad flutters"
Meanwhile: your moustache is more horrifying.
You know what? I shouldn't even be talking about. Just not mentioning the title isn't good enough.
13YOU'RE weird! ~ :D
03oh wait, now it's back
thought you'd like that otakon RaveBrony Meanwhile and MahBoi777
14lol
Om: ... Thank you. :)
o_o
loved it
13I should eat
otakon: You want a gif of me doing that instead? I'll put on some clown makeup too.
/me rests head on Om.
kirzstryfe: you can tell Nittany_Discord that I'm still at it. I'm still causing trouble, even though I know better.
alexxm: Youre so thoughtful <3
Om: I needed that. :)
Meanwhile: no thanks, I'd like some sleep this month.
^8
13my mood is being odd right now
GilDash: Why. Not feeling well?
13TOO LAZY
13TO GET FOOD
13comes from having bad experience with internet getting personal details
lol
Om: Dunno. Maybe I'm just overtired.
13just remembered we have outdated pasta in the fridge
13not sure whether I should eat it or throw it out
/me hugs Shizuka.
GilDash: Hmm. I know how that is.
so what now
Well, I'm not AT IT at it, but I'm talking about that game that I'm not supposed to bug the mods to stream.
GilDash i know that feeling too :)
sorry about the clown guys
13when the people you spent your emotionally-turbulent senior year of high school with suddenly say "hey is this your phone number can i call you? can i send you something?"
Derpy is NOT amused http://i.imgur.com/6smMQ.gif
Om: Yeah. If I fall asleep on you I'm sorry in advance.
13It's pasta salad, chicken and bacon, expired on the last day of May
it was a delightful clown alexxm
Er, every time I try to set things right, I make things worse.
13I've eaten outdated stuff before, buuuuut I dunno~
8,6internet + (-penis) = stalked
12WHY WOULD YOU EVEN THROW PASTA AWAY
12eat it now
12>:/
13apart from bees and similar imminent threats, i have never been so afraid in my life
GilDash: I doubt you would be, but alright.
13CUZ IT COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE ME SICK?
Sad but true facts.

13that burn on the back of my wrist that I thought wasn't even all that bad is still there
13and it's been over 2 weeks since I did it |D
12Actually
Om: That's what I mean. :S
12AE
damn sagas
12whats your version
lol CrazyCherry
alexxm: I know! Scary
sagas: See if you can find anything on me
13I dunno how to find out LOL
GilDash i know how it is to be tired to hell and not being able to sleep :D
8,6got bored, spammed color :p
GilDash: I see. The mantinace people woke me up today. -_- I don't know how you are going to force yourself to stay up.
05no one here has eharded these songs before? :o
I can't say that I have.
you can always plug in music and sleep like that :3
Om you would be surprised how some people can stay awake
version 14 lol
My stream derped
12ugh thats the one I downloaded
or stay awake nvm
killerpony7733: I know I would.
12hmm okay
Om: I'd say coffee, but I don't want to rely on caffeine. Already had enough of that crap at the festival.
12lets see
Shimmer: Are you in New Jersey?
Nop
GilDash: Good, its not the best for you anyway
i like the music btw :)
Shimmer: THis is more difficult
Wrek: I may have, but my memory is about 2 days long -lol- so at times its hard for me to remeber things that dont pose any signifigant change in my life. Ex. Dentist appointment versus watching the season 2 finale. I forgot the dentist apointment..
Om: I usually don't drink it.
13try this
05ok atleast someone here MUST have heard this song before
sagas: I expected it to be :p
13right click on windows live messenger and go to properties
13then compatibility
somepony else
doesnt ring any bells
GilDash: Good. You know. You could just go to sleep now. And wake up whenever tomorrow and just sleep a bit more?
Nothing for me either.
nope
i have heard this song befor
Well, if one person in the chat has heard this song before, it isn't me.
sadly I cannot recall -lol-
13try it on compatibility mode for Windows 98/Windows Me
Om: I can only sleep a maximum of 10 hours at a time... it's really annoying.
13I don't have to use that anymore but I think that's how I originally fixed MSN a few years back when it wouldn't work for ages o.o
Hey isn't Alien on later?
Least you can sleep. =__=
GilDash why? 6_9
03or just stop being lazy and reinstall Windows already LOL]
yes
GilDash: Just because, or another reason?
I believe so
killerpony7733: I don't know. Go ask my body.
Score. I love that film.
Ninjazz: Mr. Insomniac.
ohai everypony!
Om: Not really my choice... :S
Om: Catchy. ^_^
Wait I think they are showing aliens not alien
GilDash: I read. I can, and have sleapt for 12-14 hours before. Just because.
No Aliens is tommorow.
GilDash ah i see my problem is once i sleep i just can't get up no matter how many times i wake up and try to sleep again
hey Biglaw hows your day been
alexxm boring :p
It's trilogy season, 3 movies over 3 nights each week.
<Gil> 10 hours sleep is prity good, i dont see why you would be dissapointed with it
This week, Alien, Aliens, and Alien3.
wohoo Aliens
Om: If I try to sleep again the best I can do is a sort of trance like state. It really sucks. :D
05but not alien 4
\m/
05cause alien 4 sucked
Wrek: There is no Alien 4. Don't be silly.
lol
D'oh, i missed "Alien":/
12I've deleted chat logs
12but they're backed p on my pendrive
What?
GilDash: When are you planing on nodding off then?
Just like there's no 4th Indiana Jones movie.
When was Alien on?
Alien hasn't shown yet.
12and Windows live is actually still there on my programmes list
Wrek: um, you mean Alien Resurrection?
what about A v P
12so evenm though I've uninstalled everything
12its still there
just_me: suckage, next
AvP does not count
otakon: DO NOT SAY IT'S NAME.
Om: In 2 hours or so.
just_me: no. just...no.
Meanwhile: Exactly
just_me taht is a even worse movie
Ridley Scott make that AvP garbage? I don't think so.
lol
Meanwhile: Alien Resur-shot-
11,01It's name.
05AvP isnt toooooo bad
IT IS NAME!
common A v P isnt that bad
05its neat fight scene action for 1½ hours
GilDash: That is still an aweful long time to stay awake when you are very tired.
Wrek: what about the other one?
Not tooooo bad but not as good as any of it's source material.
05dont expect more of the AvP movies than they really are
Tell me im not the only one whos like this, but i love to sleep with rain, just so theres a sound to focus on instead off just silence, anyone?
Still though, between Alien or AvP, I would rather watch Alien.
05as for the predator movies
Besides arguably Predator 2.
Wrek it is a movie made of cliches. there is no originality in there
Meanwhile: agreed, however Predators was fun
wait, what?
05i kidna liked the latest one
8,6tonight's movie will be shown at 7pm EDT, about 3 hours from now
^LOl
ACS13123: I like having background noise myself
kirzstryfe what movie is it?
Why is there a movie tonight?
8,6Alien
sagas: It's trilogy season.
8,6because we feel like it :p
oh yeah trilogy
Om: It's fine if I can find mental stimulation. Talking, walking, etc. Work for example... I'll be falling asleep at my desk tomorrow, I just know it. :S
kirzstryfe: Yaaay...
Alien? tonight? I didn't missed it? :)
Nittany_Discord: that's his Rage, it powers his special abilities. It'll refill when he goes back into combat.
also, NICE!
kirzstryfe: Some terraria till then? :P
/me dusts Nittany_Discord.
Really.
otakon: Same, if itsquiet, i take much longer to fall asleep
lol Nice Alien on tonight. Well I will be on. Is it the directors cut?
Om yeah i been in GilDash's position before i kept awake for very long even super tired and i just ended up sleeping in the afternoon
are you showing one each night or all tonight?
I haven't seen ALIEN in YEARS
:D anywaaaaaaaaays
/me 11,01dusts Meanwhile
I am SO watching that
8,6working on the newsletter atm, no fun for me :'(
kirzstryfe: EDT TO EST?
kirzstryfe: but newsletters are fun!
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
Inb4 comparing facehuggers to sexual organs.
kirzstryfe: D: awww, maybe later then?
awwww dont wurry once its done your free right?
GilDash: Ahh. Not sure I could provide mental stimulation for you.
/me 11,01dusts sagas
/me puts dust on Nittany_Discord
oh, never mind
/me pets kirzstryfe ''you do an important job atm''
killerpony7733: I think we all have.
Aw. Thanks though kirzstryfe, it would not be the same here without the news letter.
7est
Om yup
/me throws a a bag full of dust at Nittany_Discord
Meanwhile: The whole movie is a metaphore for rape
8,6EDT is EST during daylight savings
/me dusts Nittany_Discord's clock, its a bit off
kirzstryfe: There, There.
Meanwhile: um, have you seen them? Also, the Alien itself. Dat head....O__o
sagas: Ikr.

/me dusts Nittany_Discord
whats EDT to GMT
/me dusts Nittany_Discord again
8,6and 3 hours from now doesn't change based on your time zone :p
otakon: I own the directors cut boxset of the Alien films, never question me on the contents.
killerpony7733: I'm literally nocturnal. I easily fall into a wake at sunset, sleep at sunrise, and find it hard to move from that.
oh lol
nvm
just_me: just three hours from now
hhisky
Alien is on par for my favourite film ever.
GilDash: Sunlight is very sleep enduceing =_=
Meanwhile: makes sense for you
03hm
You know it, Om.
otakon: What're you implying?
/me imagines a Xenomorph with a Guy Fawkes mustache "That's you Meanwhile"
03I could have sworn there was an easy way to get PSN-encrypted videos and stuff to play without actually having the rights to them LOL
Om: ... Look, I don't pretend to know why my body is like it is.
Ninjazz: I wish I had a big window faceing the sun...
GilDash i'm a bit both if i get a bucked up sleeping pattern built up like staying awake during very early morning going to sleep in the afternoon etc
Evening everypony
GilDash: That wasn't sarcasm :I
Meanwhile: mine has got to be Spirited Away
hello PrincessLuna
i ho PrincessLuna
otakon: That'd work except I'm fairly sure none of the xenomorphs exist in a male state.
Om: And over the ocean too... that would be one hell of a view.
i liek ponies
*hi
evening PrincessLuna
PrincessLuna: Evening
otakon: :D what a nice image you gave us
Hello PrincessLuna.
Meanwhile: um, they're drones
Ninjazz: Yeah.
Meanwhile: well tbh, I always thought the only female was the queen since she's the one that lays the eggs.
/me hello PrincessLuna! Hows your day been?
otakon: Aliens work like insects, and all an ant hives workers are female.
Meanwhile: No all workers are male
otakon: much like ants, where everyone is a genderless drone except males and queens
PrincessLuna: Evening. ;)
Meanwhile: not only that, but the Xenomorphs themselves take on the genetic characteristics of teh organism they infect.
That's a fair point otakon.
the only one allowed to reproduce is the queen though. that is what you are thinking of, otakon
yeah
sagas: Good, I am going out tonight...being treated to dinner and a movie :)
otakon: But then queens are born the same way.
PrincessLuna: Sounds like a perfect night out!
PrincessLuna: Oh your lucky! Where are you eating and what movie?
PrincessLuna: Where to, and what to see? Sounds good at any rate.
Meanwhile: so if a Xenomorph infected say a Gorilla, it would be different. Like how the Predalien is different then the typical human one and even breeds differently(though completely ineffectively if you think about it)
otakon: we're talking gender here.
._. dis Aliens discussion
sagas: Well I think it's an Italian place...sort of small but the food is really good. And I think we are going to see Prometheus
otakon i guess it would only work with a queen
PrincessLuna: Congrats :)
Like I said, don't question me on how the aliens work in canonical sense.
alienz
sagas: And no, we're both wrong. Most worker ants are female with a handful of male drones.
Meanwhile: well yeah but I thought I'd bring it up anyway.
otakon only a queen would alter the shape and it is much longer in the organism
PrincessLuna: Lucky! Hope you enjoy it!
Invi: by far
GODDAMMIT I CRAVE PIZZA!
PrincessLuna: Sounds wonderful. Hope you have a good night out. :)
GilDash: Thank you :)
brb gonna ask Craig if he wants to split a pie
hey PrincessLuna hows your day been
Facehuggers mutate into Praetorian facehuggers which can then mutate into a Queen from impregnation in a host.
alexxm: Good, how about yourself?
i'm good PrincessLuna http://i.imgur.com/pYdNB.gif check that gif out
And I think the Praetorian alien caste can mutate into a Queen with the absense of one.
alexxm: ...creepy O_o

GilDash: I belive I said "more", besieds I don't mind you NOT trying to abduct me whenever you are on.
YEAHHHHH!
/me kisses GilDash on the muzzle.
hm, tx
Om: I'd never abduct you. That's not my style. :(
6yup

GilDash: What word would you use then hmm?
T'is a horse of thunder.
good night everypony

Night RainbowJack
Iz a tunderhorce gooby
Om: Seduce. Nothing more, nothing less. :)
RainbowJack: Night bro /)
GilDash Besides more fun to Seduction ;)
Night Iron_edge /)
GilDash: Seduce implies you wanting more >_(\
Hell yeah Metalocalypse!
oh hello Iron_Edge! I didnt see you there! Hows your day been?
Om: Not tonight. Everypony gets a free pass tonight. :)
I love this song!
sagas: I've just been observing for the time being. And cant complain. How about you?
GilDash: Oh good. So I can make all the jokes I do when you arent here.
Those gigantic demons O_O
Iron_Edge: Im doing well thanks:)
Om: Tonight only. :)
GilDash what free pass? :O
What game is this?
GilDash: Fantastic. If I think of something I won't filter it then
icybeauti: Diablo 3
hey Iron_Edge!
05sooon done
This is diablo? I didn't know, I thought it would be different.
Om: You shouldn't filter around me anyway... :(
/me runs then jumps in the air with hoof raised /)
killerpony7733: Stick around this week. You'll see me in action. ;)
GilDash: Did I say that?
13!pokemon

Iron_Edge: (\
13<3
GilDash as in????? i'm almost afraid to ask but my curiousity makes me
Gotta love the kloks
Rain: yes and it FITS the game atm
huh, is the lack of something really its negative
DeathKlock always fits
internet + (-penis) = stalked
BLOOD CLAN!
killerpony7733: That would be telling. ;)
surely it would be Internet + 0(Penis)
Dethklok is...I don't know if I should say best band ever....
Dunno, hate math.
...what.
which makes no sense
so Penis = !Stalked?
icybeauti: wel, considering they ARE NOT REAL I would say no.
6daiyousei~
killerpony7733: You know how there are private mesages you can send. And you can type ANYTHING you want there?
GilDash ah..... oh gildash :D
/me carefully distances himself.
otakon: Brenden Samlls does IRL shows
Om I kinda do but never do it
icybeauti: oh
hey, i'm just examining kirzstryfe's math
What is this music?
Classic music :$
/me tackles Lasharus before he can escape
it's familiar
killerpony7733: Gillysuit does. Let your imagination free
/me teleports away.
Archmage, remember.
I might have heard this in my childhood. My parents ike classical music
Om actually don't remember how to do it >_<
no RP
:P
8,6holding onto you, so teleported with you :p
good
AND THEN IT ROCKED
I'm goign back to volbeat music
/me noms on Chrysalis
Octavia approves of this rock
nvm
o.0
COINCIDENCE!
i'm not cheese!
8,6I'm nomming on you, your opinion is negated
I think it's ok in here because we're not as...slow, as mane chat.
8,6pretty sure you all know how to stop before it goes to far
6huh
6that envelope glue tasted better than normal
Exactly.
GTG PONIES!! BYE!!
8,6which is the main concern with letting RP happen in mane chat
So tired. I need a nap -_-
Later CrazyCherry
bye CrazyCherry
Bye capslockCherry.
Bye CrazyCherry! See ya later!
07that
07uh
Indeed.
CrazyCherry: Later /)
Om: go to shleep
07lol
6I'M SORRY
8,6or even worse, if it was allowed in RD >.<
CrazyCherry: Don't come back to soon~
Meanwhile: Herp.
/me hurls Kirz away from him telekinetically and teleports away again.
6I'VE ALWAYS LIKED ENVELOPE GLUE
That channel that bad?
6well
6jk not true
6some of it is too bitter
MahBoi777: I might very soon ooh -_-
8,6it gets bad sometimes
/me hugs CrazyCherry goodbye.
6ths one was like
6swet and sour
Iron_Edge: (\
6sweet
CrazyCherry: See you in a week. :)
:(
o-o
youd think people didnt read the rules sometimes
I love this song! It's funny how I found out about this band when the opened at gigantour.
oh wait
6I'll go to my corner now
I wont be on for a week!
8,6if there's a scene where someone can make a crude comment, it's usually made in RD first
/me hugs GilDash back.
Sounds like exactly not my channel.
14ow
14headche :(
13when I was little I used to looooove envelope glue |D
But then, I'm a magic-fanatic and something of a recluse.
CrazyCherry: derp.
Twilight suits me. :P
13I'm a bit meh on it now though
14someone massages my brain Dx
8,6:)
LoyalDash: Now you invite me. :D
so long as i get s1 luna
Ninjazz: To what?
8,6ugh, hate writing about myself
Ninjazz: Oh, derp.:D
13if they haven't made them already
You just need enough of an ego for it kirz.
Om: Hang out.
It's why my fanfic's coming along nicely. :P
13flavoured envelope glue needs to be made
You the newsletter mod spot this week kirz?
(Actually, had writer's block for ages, but whatever :P)
8,6yeah >.<
/me tackles Ninjazz
Ninjazz: -_^
I'm sure it'll be fun to read. :P
ooh we get kirzfo
Om: Don't think too much about it... Oof.
Ninjazz: Yeah. Okay.
6that needs to happen
Om: It's really best you don't ask I think... :S
I forgot how much this dude sounds like elvis....
6I'd be all over those apple flavored ones
6..
6ok that would be a bad idea
13LOL
13envelope glue addictions
icybeauti: Oddly enough I was just thinking that same thing :D
07|D
13IT'S A THING
8,6it's not going to be very long, seems the rest of the staff got long-winded in covering their stuff and I don't want to have to extend the height of the image a 2nd time
GilDash: Alright. I wont push it further if you say so.
Iron_Edge: I saw them live. It was cool eharing him talk there.
GilDash: Stop implying thing. =__=
lol
I don't like spiders
Om: Just saying. If you don't really like me acting up then... :D
Ninjazz: Stop reading into them. ;)
GilDash: I wouldn't say I hate it.
Inb4 5 lines.
:p
hello everypony
Wait isn't the music volbeat?
Om: You see, you give me as many mixed signals as I do you. :D
Hey everyone? :D

Om: I... damnit, stop trolling me. :D
Fair enough. Whatever works best.
Madsurge... well.... im both a mare and colt here :3
Om i know what a pumpkin is :[
panda: :S
*:D
GilDash: What? I am no troll.
It doesn't work in mane chat does it?
panda lol :D
Using /me for colours that is.
panda: Then stop asking question and get into a kitchen :)
13idunno
icybeauti: I knew it! :D
I obviously don't intend to find out because it'd set off a chain.
Om yes sir:D
MadSurge: Yeah, I do act girly in ehre lol
mmmmmm pumpkins
Myrei :D hiya

Om: Sometimes I wonder. :D
How are you?
hi Myrei

icybeauti: a girl that watches MLP? MADNESS :D
hello Myrei
i feel loved XD
GilDash: With good reason.
MadSurge: It is madness. But the ponies are amazing.....
13SuperZuro64: Change your nick and do not impersonate mods.
13You have ten seconds.

Shizuka readies her ban hammer
im impersonating a mod? O_o
Kirz xD dat message?
icybeauti: Indeed. Btw, who's your favorite?

Om: Yep. You're never quite straight with me, are you? :D
MadSurge: Rarity

Dat kick message.
oh <_<
im clueless
icybeauti: Good choice! :)
Lil_B :D
GilDash: I am as crooked as a snake in a rock tumbler.
05"untill the fillies round up at me"
panda HWAT?! how did <ou see me?
How do you impersonate a mod? You can tell who they are by the colored text....
icybeauti: used to hate her, but her hammy moments are hilarious :D
Goodbye people
Lil_b im psychic :D
bye ACS13123
08,01decisions, decisions
panda: Yet you cant make a good sandwich -_-
MadSurge: I love the whole fashion thing she has and she acts like me. Afraid to get dirty and all that.
08,01okay, i need your opinions on something
Om :( im doing it now
/me is scared of panda
Om: That's so crooked I don't even know where to start. :D
08,01i'm look at postgraduate study programmes
I was intrigued by your talk of internet privacy and decided to go full stalker on you
GilDash: I thought it was a good analogy.
08,01and i really want to be involved in education, particularly computer science education
Madsurge you crash?
08,01i'm really interested in the way programming is taught in to kids
icybeauti: chat derped, what was your last message?
08,01and how we can get schools to churn out more competent programmers
MadSurge: I said she acts a lot like me. She's into fashion the way I am and hates classless people. Plus, I freak out when I get dirty like her lol.
08,01and how to invent programming languages that facilitate an easier way of creating programs, but for beginners and professionals
I with Shizuka on this one.
lol
08,01GilDash: i know that, let me explain the problem
Icybeauti omg... i think i love you
GilDash: So hasty.
Wrek but i thought basic was fun :m
/me glomps panda
08,01panda: that's not what i mean; maybe it was a bad way of putting it. the way programming and computer science is currently taught in schools is beyond bad.
icybeauti: Well I try to be at least decently classy, unless I really know people and start jokingly act sloppy and stupid :D
13stalking is bad mmkay?
05ok
Indeed.
:D
05wish me luck
Om: Brain =/= functioning tonight, okay? :D
A lot of people I know from my grade don't have any manners. I really hate when people don't have manners.
Break a leg Wrek.
I just did it because i was bored
I am back bronystate! And I have brought tons of jimmys for Wrek to Rustle!
GilDash: I think its functioning just fine
alexxm: Let me explain: THIS IS A MOUSE! THIS IS THE SCREEN! YOU CLICK LIKE THIS!
08,01which is largely the case now
hey BlazeAngel what have you been up to
icybeauti: how so? Disrespect for other people or filthyness? :D
icybeauti oh yeah thats bad
08,01panda: i'm saying it should be just as important as physics or chemistry, which are also electives at most school
Andrew Bell
08,01yes?
02*WB03(MysticLugia03)02WB* - <MysticLugia> 12And even with help, I am yet not able to get that what I want
08,01that's me
MadSurge: Disrespect mostly. I heard there were kdis picking on a special ed kid the other day.
DUN DUN DUUN!
Im scared how much ive been able to learn about you
08,01bet you don't know my middle name
so, WHO is that?
oh it's Diablo
13don't be spreading personal information here
08,01sagas: i'm pretty open
icybeauti: :O no respect for such assholes.
ive noticed
no it's not
Everyone! I am looking (or at least hoping) for a minecraft buddy or crew! Seriously, Im getting bored as buck spending the nights in my ass-looking wooden house alone. Anyone?
08,01sagas: the cat's dead now, unfortunately
a'wwww
Blazeangel, im down but... i have a cracked minecraft :(
awww now you made me sad :'(
MadSurge: I know! When I heard this, I was about to cry and was so pissed.
Is it me or is that boss dropping corpses?
Meanwhile: well he IS the Lord of Hell
08,01sagas: discuss this with me in private if you want
sagas: don't be sad, get glad
08,01sagas: i'd love to know wha tyou found
otakon: Still, corpse bombs? I saw enough of those in Warcraft 3.
icybeauti: my fav(s) is Pinkie/Fluttershy btw.
okay
Shizuka, define personal info :3
sagas: Listen to smile smile smile if you're feelign down.
Meanwhile: it IS Blizzard
and COME ON I CALL HACKS!
08,01BlazeAngel: no time, unfortunately
otakon: Whelps.
08,01anyhoos, as i was saying
what is it with blizzard and weaponized corpses
08,01i have a number of choices right now
MadSurge: I love fluttershy a lot. Ever since I read cupcakes though, my view changed a little for pinkie though...
all those damage damage fields taking up 90% of the battlefield
it's bull
icybeauti: and that would have made me actually angry, while I usually have a ton of patience.
Why is that demon fat? I would think they would work out for a job like this
08,01one option would be to get a Teaching Diploma and become a teacher
icybeauti: Wanna come play Minecraft with me? :3
08,01i'd do that for a while, being on the front lines as it were
08,01get some real experience with it
08,01unfortunately, this isn't very well paid
08,01panda: computer science, but yes
13on top of his license to kill
oh my
Shizuka: how about a license to be silly?
NO BUFFER!
otakon: REVOKED!
Shizuka: What about a licence to ponehs? :3
pony_1664: Work out for dropping bodies and making circles on the ground? Doesn't sound like a LOT of work
otakon: Forever buffering.
13you can't license silly
13that would be..
/me 13lowers her glasses
BlazeAngel: I don't have mindcraft, sorry :(
13silly
Shizuka: silly....DAMMIT
http://puu.sh/AieG
classes r hawt
Shakaran: Mr. Waternoose REALLY let himself go
Shakaran: Cannot unsee
Shizuka, do you have the computer game by the name of minecraft? :3
Shakaran so thats what happened after the film mr waternose became the king of hell
yAY THEY WON!
08,01aye
and then Lea became evil
I'm calling it
someone goes evil
otakon: inb4 it's you.
08,01but, then again, i'm not sure how beneficial that'd be to my goals
otakon: Is it Lea?
Meanwhile: nah, it's your Moustache
08,01another option is to do a Masters in Education
BlazeAngel: I almost guarantee it
08,01then maybe a PhD in Education
otakon: what, not the rest of me as well?
backpack so organised
Meanwhile: it's just so fiendishly magnificent.
Meanwhile: No, only an evil moostache.
08,01but then, what i *could* do is become a teacher, then do a Masters in Education part time
08,01that'd be 2 or 3 years
13BlazeAngel: never heard of it, is it new?
The dr......Grab a TARDIS and star traveling...
08,01then after that, do a PhD full time
08,01in fact, thinking about it, that's a really good option
02Nini everyone~
14night :3
08,01then again, i don't know if i want to do a Masters in Education or Comptuer Science, to be honest
Oh no :S
wait... Tyriel?
this is NOT gonna be good
Choices choices choices....
this can only end well
it's NEVER this simple when it comes to Diablo
I got a jury duty summons - july 3
oh snap what a twist
I KNEW IT!
Oh hey look otakon you were right.
Wrek, your music is going well with my game of Uncharted 3 :3
hell, final year BSc is easy in comparison
Cypresswolf: -hugs- Dawwwww
No no, I am sure its fine.
08,01though really, maybe what i'd do is a Teaching Diploma, then work as a teacher for 3 years while doing a part-time masters in Education, then a full time CS PhD in programming language design
wait.... AIDAN was the dark wanderer?
13BlazeAngel: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
08,01actually, that's a really good plan, i think
language design?
what difficulty is this?
otakon yes
GODDAMMIT I KNEW IT
NO BUFFER NOT NOW!
Shizuka: I'll go with plan B - answer the question in a way they wont pick me :P
whats up every pony
Oh dear.
That's not true! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
welp, poor Lea
hey xxMoopyxx hows your day been
13BlazeAngel: http://youtu.be/B8A01RmPAxg of course i know minecraft
And hi xxMoopyxx
The designate.
oh uncle deckard
she's been corrupted
/me explodes
good i stayed up late last night
STUPID BUFFER
Why's she talk to herself.
My 3rd summons in 4 years, I only had to sit on the bench in 1/2 so far
Shizuka: *explodes*
Shizuka, stop teasing the poor guy :p
dat lack of colour!
13awwwww
i assume what just happened isn't good
Dude, your color....
Meanwhile: A lot of characters do that
White and black
Shizuka: The point is, wanna play it? Good one, ;)
He is now a regular jackoff like us
Black and White
MegaMoonShine: True. Talking to the audience rather than themselves really.
13eenope
8,6she is quite sneaky about that
MahBoi777: Raceist.
man mouse smoothing is Sooo annoying
Meanwhile: I have the same problem :D
08,01panda: i think so
Shizuka: Shizuka?
Om: wut, Black and White sounds better, HOW is that racist?
Meanwhile: I talk to myself a lot and it's kinda annoying
But I already have..
MegaMoonShine: Ikr.
Om: It's alphabetical. :)
MahBoi777: That's reverse racism
08,01Lil_B: i think you're right that they see it as unnecessary, but as the world changes over to our generation, this will change
GilDash: I knew you would say that.
08,01because computers are the world now
icybeauti: I don't see color
08,01put it this way: there's a reason that computing is one of the highest paid professions
MahBoi777: I just like calling everything raceist. And watching people stutter
Om: Why me specifically? :D
MahBoi777: Sounds better
08,01everyone needs peopel who know about computers now
Om: ah I see
05uhm
8,6Rain is so hipster :p
08,01even in minor senses
05how to start cinematics?
GilDash: You are a writer, and I know you to some degree
13rain rain <33
EAT IT, Meanwhile! >:D
Om nom.
Since we are in a fast pace technology era, we need to learn about computers in a more educational light.
8,6lol
<3 Shizuka <3
go to login screen i think
Om: A writer who doesn't write, and not as well as you'd think. :)
Rain: Tastes like defeat. ;n;
13a writer who doesn't write?
The cinematics in this game are so awesome
13sounds like me..
>:3
Shizuka Funny, I'm writting now...
hey, can somepony help me out with some TF2 stuff?
GilDash: But you still value some degree of orgonization.
08,01panda: teaching diploma -> work as a teacher for 2 years while doing a part-time Masters in Education -> work a further 2 or 3 years as a teacher, maybe dabble in education politics -> do full time PhD in CS relating to programming languages
?
my latest fix to a problem, was to uncheck a box that someone had checked because "shouldnt you always check the boxes"
What tf2 stuff, RaveBrony ?
Shizuka: Let's form a club. Bonus points if you haven't read in years either.
13nope i've read, i've read a lot
Jim: Some questions, lol.
I lvoe readins.
05gah this annoys me

Om: Ideally yes, but I've not the effort to bother with it normally.
GilDash: Dude.... your reading now. *facehoof*
8,6wait, so you have to be logged in to do everything in d3 except watch the movies?
Jim: One, do your weapons harm teammates?
BlazeAngel: I mean novels and the like. Haven't read one in 3 years now... that's actually really depressing. :(

:O
06Well now I have been gathering musik for you all c:

Violetvanilla there is a ggg there? I wanna go!!!
So is this mod a streaming mod?
RaveBrony: Achievement milestones have some item rewards, but otherwise you can find items entirely at random.
I would love to become a mod and stream stuff
VioletVanilla you have to tell me when you in are in Hessen, wo I can get an autogramm from you :3
Icybeauti you and me both ^-^
VioletVanilla: I have lived in the Netherlands for all my life, and I have mastered my English. (No I havent)
06Om: I am, I head the audio/visual department, I run the radio show that has been missing for a bit unfortunately . .
i never herd this befor
Meanwhile: Really? But i never get any items :'( plus, is there some 'random join game' button? Cuz...im lost with joining
052 more songs from this album
05then im done for then ight
I hope they have sad man's tongue on that
VioletGreySha: Ahh, I joined here shortly agter you left It would seem. Looking foreward to hearing your stuff.
Ok :)
VioletVanilla finally a reason for me to spent the 40€ for GalaCon... still not sure thou :/
sorry, but no matter how hard a death metal band can be, I still cannot get over the fact that with a name like Volbeat, I am going to see you as a pokemon type of band :)

RaveBrony: There should be a button that has something like "Start Playing" on it, that'll give you a game mode menu, pick one and you're off. Otherwise there's the server browser.

Wait, is CCCP here?

Chains=chains :D
Happy happy birthday to you and you today!
hi CCCP
hey cccp
hey CCCP what have you been up to
12USJ?
03yeah
/me is watching Code Geass
12lawl
No no no I stole his name for a sec
03just started season 2
08,01fork() and exec() is a retarded way of goign about spawning processes
Chains stop chaning your name to cccp and vice versa :D you aren fooling anyone xD
Birthdays? YAY :$
Mine
GilDash: I Like the uniquness of each individual.
Wrek: Alrighty then, ill catch you sometime later this week i suppose :P
Meh, i like fork
12ah
/me sings
get to fork all the programs
Om: I'll believe that when I see it. :)
/me had serious talking with parents about.. stuff
UM
/me glomps VioletVanilla
Discord is here...
it was good alexxm until I discovered for the first time ever today the cupcakes video :(
/me hugs coyboy
At the bottom of the user list
08,01panda: if you don't fork(), what process exec()s?
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior
GilDash: You rely on your sight to much it would seem :)
Volbeat is best rockabilly band.
Om I agree but people are to some point losing uniqueness over time atleast in my eyes
08,01instead of fork(), there should be something like emptyprocess()
Volbeat the band>Volbeat the pokemon
killerpony7733: Look deeper.
Om: I'm nocturnal, which means lot of darkness. So no, hearing, smell and tactile takes a lot of work too.
08,01does the same thing, but has an implicit exec()
08,01and blocks until it can exec()
I think I'm getting my rule books mixed up, is roleplaying allowed?
08,01or spawnprocess() would be a better name
05aaand im done
They should make a special room just for roleplaying.
Whos streaming next?
YEAH
There is a rule against excesive roleplaying Chains
Thank you sir for the stream Wrek <3
GilDash: Oh yes, I forgot how releven primary senses are when you use sight in a metaphof.
08,01Iron_Edge: fork() duplicates the currect process, copies the memory, and retains all open file pointers
metaphor*
icebeauti that would be good
Excessive? I can deal with that.
night Wrek thanks again
o/ wrek :)
awww I missed Wrek's stream :(
I just came up with that :)
Thanks for streaming Wrek.
Enjoy your documentary Wrek!
Gnight Wrek
Bai Wrek
Yeah Wrek, it was great. Later!
enjoy your show Wrek
08,01Iron_Edge: exec() executes a new program, overwriting the current process
GoodbyeWrekHaveANiceDay:)
lol, Chains, learn to spacebar :p
Om: I bridge things too easily for my own good. :)
How do I spacebar?
One does not simply space into words.
08,01so the convention to spawn a new program is that you fork() your current program, then detect whether you're in the parent or the child. if you're in the child, you exec()
LearnToWhat?IDon'tKnowWhat"Spacebar"Is.O_o
08,01killerpony7733: no idea
GilDash: I think it might be somthing you learned to to for your own good. As a result of something that you lacked in a particular time.
thanks for the stream Wrek
Om: I won't even begin to debate how that might not be the case...
I have to pee!
Congratulations.
>.>
GilDash: But you want to.
06An empty stream? (;
how many of you guys enjoyed the symphonic metal I requested last night? btw I'm metalzeldapony
Dat auto kick.
Indeed it is empty
VioletVanila yup
Om: I hate those kinds of debates. They never lead anywhere good.
What debates?
/me is reading the rules. "What counts as a non-image link?"
ViVi is a silly filly.
GilDash: When have I ever lead to something good anyway? Hmm?
Violetvanilla it was sumica :D
06Youtube videos, such as those~
08,01panda: because the code is the same in both. the object of it all is to spawn a child process. say you're the bash process, and you want to execute ls as a child process, with the same stdout and stdin as you're using
Chains: A link that isn't purely an image.
A duuuuuuur.
A gif?
Chains: videos or fanfictions
Om: You'd be surprised. :)
A song?
Chains: gif counts as an image.
Hello
GilDash: I would. But not tonight, as you are.
It's really a common sense thing.
08,01you fork() to create a new bash, which maintains your currently open stdout and stdin in the child
Hi omnom aka chains :D
hello OmNom
08,01but you want the child to be ls
hai OmNom
panda stfu
Omnom :D why!
08,01so you exec(ls), which overrides the code and data in the child with the ls process that's beign started
Hi OmNom
Om: I nearly never get surprised, Om. :)
I see a person named Om...?
Great. Now I'm guna get fake pinged more -_-
08,01Chrysalis: that's exactly my point!
08,01panda: sure
08,01it's a stupi way of doing it
08,01why copy your process, when you're just going to override it anyway...

"Oh yeah, we're totally joking around! We totally don't despise nerds. That's why we made every 'nerdy' character in the show an asocial moron who does nothing but play into every stereotype about geeks from the last 30 years of entertainment."

Don't mind me, it was a poor joke :(
/me is the type of pony that loves to drink, be abused by his friends, fight hate with hate, and sleep in a barrel
I bet if I did quit coming here no one'd notice.
Irish_Pony: Sounds like a bad story there... :(
Wow that sounds really depressing.
Sorry.
Irish_Pony sounds fun can i help
VioletVanila: do you actually use your pony songs remixes? And if yes, do people realize what they're dancing at? :D

:D I recognize this one too
hi guys
06This ist the remix I did~
06Feather :3
GilDash: That sounds bad.
06Also Aurora does the forums lie or is your birthday today (for me living in the future, from 25 minutes ago) ? :P
Om: Well, it's not good! I seriously thought I saw a zombie at one point. :D

6oh hey, reversing numbers
/me notices the chat went silent to listen to the song.
ahhhh silence
GilDash: You did. It was yu xD
Silence you say? KZIJMFDKVM
Om: Not in the middle of the road, Om... :|

10so HAH
GilDash: detailssss
6I used to have teal
6but changed since a lot of people had it
Om: Even worse when you consider we were on the *motorway* where there are no people on the road.
06It's pretty much illegal for me to not have this text color when I have this name.
6and then all of a sudden people are purple
10WAIT IT'S AURORA'S BIRTHDAY TOMORROW
06I used to teal toooo so yeah
6BUT ANYWAYS thanks espeon
6yeah it is feather
6I've been fairly DL about it since
06Also because all ponies are dancing!

hhehe
/me has not an OC but still dances
Can't dance, doing ratamacues.
Om: Nah, in Britain it's illegal for people to be on Motorways. Makes sense, seeming as the limit is 70mph and there's a no stop policy.
/me tries to get the party starting with trying to nudge ponies to the dance floor. "Piiinkiieeee, start em up!"
/me dances in the VIP Mod-only room :p

Is it me or does this look way better than Avatar?~
Michael: I've seen it but it was YEARS ago
Then suddenly HALE 9000
What did i miss
Nyria: it's not just you, it still looks good
To be fair, though, I believe sailors are obligated to render assistance unless they themselves would be put in peril.
Eh, Avatar had faster fluidity, this is more suspenseful
00,10that is the end of the event Calcos323
Nyria: it certainly looks more real
i think everyone has seen this movie :D
I hated Avatar
Randomnerd: Yes, they are. International maritime law
Which one?
witch 1
ChaoMing : with SPACE clauses that screw engineers out of their hard earned SPACE DOLLARS $$
once you get past the cat people it's just boring
Sumica: KICKASS! Will it be the extended edition?
alien, this movie
00,10ofcorse,
I though Avatar was pretty average. Entertaining, but average
what did i miss
SPACE Dollars, the best kind of currency for SPACE
Sumica, you've just made my night
Diglett: nothing interesting
cool
00,10keep in mind that's not till august though
Man, I keep forgetting how small LV-426 is.
as long as Avatar was, it still felt like there were holes and that it was a bit rushed
Avatar was pretty but had kind of a weak plot in retrospect.
Diglett: It just started so not much
Avatar was boss in cinemas but on a tv it was crappy
Don't care, Sumica, it gives me something to look forward to
13but it had robot knife fights
Sumica so, what else are you showing? Will there be a list on the newsletter?
Nerom: exactly
Cue the vector graphics...
So is the last movie of this trilogy Alien 3 or Alien Resurrection?
Aww
Fleta: 3
Fleta Alien 3. THERE WERE ONLY 3!!!
I was expecting a hyperspace jump thingy from Star Wars
Fleta: should be Promethius
00,10this weeks news letter will list next weeks trilogy
11,01Alien 3.
Resurrection doesnt exist >_<
3, Resurrection never happened
Avatar looks really weird at 60 fps.
thx Sumica
Seapony Lyra playing with a rubber ducky TOTALLY adds to the tention of the movie
Darf14: neither does Alien 3
Fleta: We don't talk about resurrection around here
I heard that most people stop at the second movie
Sumica so no valve stuff will ever appear then?
Lol, I didn't like Alien 3 but loved Alien Resurrection. Weird I know, but I also watch MLP too :D
its a good stopping point anyway
00,10Resarection never happend
Colt_of_Personality welcome to BronyState
So that's the Nostromo, yes?
Just watch the first two movies and forget that anything else was ever made.
Just the little part?
Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, and the AvP movies do not exist
13wasn't that the guy that predicted stuff?
I find it hilarious that most spaceship engines you see are just lights instead of actual pyrotechnics
like Pretator 1 was the only good one
Sadly the first Aliens movie I ever saw was Ressurrection and I hated it
the best movie from alien is alien 2, in my opinion
Shizuka: Nostradamus
I think i have not seen ressurection
They did a barrel roll -shot-
is the most i liked it
Nerom: spare yourself
yeah, call me uncultured but Alien is 80% buildup
13Randomnerd: no no that was the ship in Alien
Nostromo is a reference to Joseph Conrad
they press r twice
Michael I've only seen Alien, but that was years ago
00,10fire tends to melt the models ChaoMing
That is true
for some reason, channels absolutely LOVE to air Alien Ressurection rather than any of the first 3
Shizuka: lol
little
Is it the one where they clone that woman with the alien?
I walked into that one...
Canadian_Brony: it's a great movie :S
/me 13is operating on only like three brain cells else there would have been a longer chain of puns there
Nerom : Yup
:~$
Good old Vector Computer Graphics, surely this is the future:)
:P
lol
call santa
Look at them buttons
xDDDD :D
Am I the only one that keeps confusing the words Sumica and Shizuka?
Fleta: I quite like that one. and I have never seen this one before
needs more busy talk.
I still think vector graphics look like The Future(TM)
Nerom, you're in for a treat
Hmm, them landing a spaceship reminds me of the time I landed planes perfectly in Wings of Prey
00,10Most confuse the genders too Calcos323
Remember This is suppose to take place AFTER Prometheus
Shizuka you remind me of me when it's 5:30 in the morning and I'm staring at the Food Network clutching a 2 litre of Pepsi. Good times . ..
why does the future have somany buttons
13how do you confuse us.... one of us types in a pretty pastel color, and the other streams anime from time to time
Looks like Santa got a bigger sled
lol
Nerom, then we're like the only 2 in the world who did like it :(
02Nice!
No, I mean just the words, not the people
Oh my God, a giant rock!
Shizuka: so, you stream anime right :3
space tuning
OH NO!
shit what a crash!
00,10great landing
derp, lets just ram the ship into the ground
/me 13waits for that to go over everyones heads
Painc!
what about the button
8,6don't confuse their genders, Sumica is female and Shizuka is a robot
lol
go panic
10 point landing
Lol Fleta It was good not just as good as the others I have seen
nuuuuuuuuu
Why a straight answer? Why not a homosexual answer?
I give that landing a 2 /10
SPACE collisions
Still I liked it
00,10did they land on a spike?
11,01And kirzstryfe has tasty colors.
kirzstryfe that explains alot . . .
seems like it
*rimshot*
Pinkie "Would anyone care to join me in panicking? No, okay! ....AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!"
THEY LANDED ON SPIKE?!?
Litwick: Or an answer that's mostly straight but experimented in college?
HOW COULD THEY
So much damage from landing on a friggin' rock.
00,10re rout all ducks
Calcos323 my thoughts exactly
9/10 but only because of the lighting effects and these fire sparkles :D
REROUT THE AIR DUCTS
wat
11,01Also, crappy landing.
Dat Technobabble
Calcos323: naw, they landed on Henry, Tom's 2nd cousin
reroute*?
13better than landing on planet bob
otakon : The ducts need rerouting? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
in the future, wind chimes still exist
in the future, you can hardly hear what the other guy says on the phone while on an uncharted planet
Look at all the flashing lights, that means the ship is broken
why do they use aol
00,10beats my mun landing
Fleta: use duct tape! and they need MOAR RAILINGS!
Land on creepy planet, create instant haunted house.
@Diglett, they're not
WHERE ARE THE RAILINGS!?
just patch it up with Duct Tape. It'll be fine
That's using Windux 95
They're*
13no duct tape on mars
oh
00,10nah win 3.1
Shizuka: how about WD 40?
Duct tape for Ducts. Makes Sense
In space, nopony can hear you order duct tape
Nah, Windows has a user-friendly interface
13they forgot how to make it
linux/unix does not
so, combine the two
c:
The ship need railings installed to prevent another crash
Shizuka this is Mars?
2000 meters? We can use the SPACE CAMARO!!!
00,10matrix beta
I doubt they have MS DOS or something
Matrix
13sure, don't you see the demons?
HE CAN READ THE MATRIX NUMBERS
Run the debug program
Hes the chosen one! :O
This is The Matrix before The Matrix was The Matrix
try @echo off del "System32.exe"
Shizuka . . . now I'm really lost
:P
Yellow Matrix > Green Matrix
he can see the matrix
13don't worry, i have no brainpower tonight
Shizuka who would have guessed
dat shake
spoiler: he can read the matrix because he is neo
Space
Yellow matrix is the only weakness of the green matrix
let's go spaceeeeeeeeee
spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccccccceeeeeeee
Michael: SPACCCCCCCCCCCE
02I think I played it too fast though
the only complaint I have about this movie really is that it takes a bit too long for the alien to show up
Space is fun
gptta gp tp s[ace
SPACEEEEEEEEEEEE
/me sings "it's a beautiful day in the universe, a solar eruption would make it worse"
SPACE ELEVATORS
Holy shit i knew it was a bad idea turning my headphones extra loud
00,10but this is not space
Real spoiler: He can read the matrix because he is an agent
I dont know a single name of a single pony
gotta go to space
00,10they landed
02Now I'm stuck waiting for the next Zelda game :/

They're in astronaut suits, so lets just consider them in space still
the xenomorph has landed
Suddenly LUNA
GOOD SPACE CONTACT
They're no where near the moon, though
02fun game to replay though
/me is geeky enough to know that operators read Matrix code.
this is not the moon :(
00,10axe you
Im afraid they wont meet Luna there since theyre not on the moon :(
I dont think there on the moon

But they meet Chrysalis sooN!

I already know that LL is gonna keep pushing me to finish this game XD
Ok theres three units on the ground, Ill position this unit over there whi- .... ugh ive been playing too much Xcom >_<
In space, no one can hear you make stupid remarks
Distortion: Ohi Bro
what, is swearing obsolete in the future or something?
Dat dat creates reality paradox
most likely it will take me along time X3

When this movie came out, it looked like nothing that had ever come out before.
ChaoMing: Scalloped Potato
it's like i'm watching the Blaire Witch Project or somethin

Thats right go on for Science!

Hi Paladin_Drakkenwolf

00,10could be worse, it could have gone to a buffering circle
Do you guys think they have 1-1 upgrades yet?
Hello Paladin_Drakkenwolf
Dat Darth Vader breathing
Randomnerd O YEAH!!!
hai Paladin_Drakkenwolf
Canadian_Brony: like I said, Scalloped Potato level of equipment
Huh, why am I hearing Darth Vader?
That's because the monitors were hooked up by grade school teachers.
Hi, Paladin_Drakkenwolf
Sumica: PLEASE DON'T JINX IT
hiya Paladin_Drakkenwolf
Aliens was pretty cool for realizing that video screens would be 16:9
Sumica: In the future, Mips runs all video.
00,02i think i read about this movie
I hope they have some Marauders in their unit composition
else ez 2-2 roach rush
otakon I hate scalloped potatoes. The texture is just revolting
00,10firebats all the way
And they climb into a vagina to discover a giant fetus...
Canadian_Brony: I like them
why didnt they have flat screens
8,6this was from when the franchise was about horror, not action

Practical effects are so much cooler than CGI
LOOK AT THE CHEST!
.....Aliens
00,10it's a Zentradi
Just to clarify for everyone this is NOT the same alien ship as in prometheus
Midnight_Fyre: so agreed
that is a life form?
MAN, will you look at the Lazy Boy!
How many of you saw Prometheus and are depressed on how it connected to none of this?
how can something be fossilized without being pressurized and fertilized?
it's a skeleton
KA-BOOM
Some of us haven;t seen it yet, so please don't talk about it.
Phase4: I predict they will have 2 sequels before the first Alien
Same type of ship though. Same aliens
I wonder if he exploded twice
00,02ah, k
00,10might have had presure before it landed
Distortion that makes me very angry. I didn't watch it, but if it has nothing to do with this . . . ugh
So a Alien...killed by and Alien?
ChaoMing: magic
an*
SPACE magic
ChaoMing: dry rot really, plus the Space Jockey was from the looks of things had a exoskeleton
RivaLZ seems legit
dat face
your right\
13space jockey..?
What's more amazing than finding an alien corpse? A hole in the floor.
she looks bored
omg a giant hole
Shizuka: not THAT kind of jockey
00,10"it's a warning"
13it floats around giggling until it finds a ship to attach to?
THEN HEED IT!
When dealing with HR Geiger is one of the few times you can actually use the term Mind Rape litterally
Dunnnn
One does not simply fossilize without being surrounded by carbon, space is not carbon-based :|
SHOO BEE DOO... oh, this is space
Shizuka: no, that's the other thing in this movie
CALL UPON THE SPACE PONYS!
00,10ChaoMing who said the ship has no air?
13those are just headcrabs
13applied directly to the forehead
owlicious: Call upon the "space" ponies?
ChaoMing: well, the equivalent of fossilizing in a no atmosphere environment
brb
Hmm, I see your point
yeah, a cave in a SHIP
SPAAAAAAACE(!!!) ponies
I think there origional mission was to find the space core, but instead they found a ship
otakon: So, they said fossilized when they meant dessicated.
030
but they're in a spaceship, it has to have an atmosphere
Sanctum
seems legit
DocSane: I think so
But it's a dry heat! << Aliens reference :D
else they'll be forced to be in astronaut mode the entire time they're there
DocSane: but that's kind of the same thing
Fleta: yeah, you want that after you live in Florida.
ChoaMing, the MOON has an atmosphere but we can't breath in there either!
Dagerous air
brb
EGGS
00,10leather like egg?
Bad sign #1

They're not on the moon, and they're in a spaceship/space station

what i miss my computer took me off
Darf14: Like I said, this movie breaks the trope.
Secret Butt fun....
See, this movie is brilliant because it makes you think Kane is the main character and then kills him.
I say use fish faced woman as bait
Then you think Dallas is the hero, and they kill him.
SHE HAS THE RIGHT IDEA
Darf14: Because he didn't die first
SURPRISING BUTT FUN! I'm back
Why would you pack a shuttle that can't fit the whole crew?
oh right
:'( aww man
Funny thing is........I was born in Dallas
Ripley is the best hero ever.

you can actually do that in the AVP game from 2011. you grab a soldier from behind and your tail slides up his butt and out the mouth
Shamroc: badder than Samuel L. Jackson by far

If this were Star Trek they'd have caught and studied it by now.
This message will self-destroy in 10 minutes
I love how complicated the scuttle controls are.
Derpy_Hooves: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Paper clip appears "so it looks like you're trying to distruct the the ship"
Tovler what makes you say that?
Who the hell made this self-destruct mechanism?
00,10no one button to destroy ship
"SELF DESTRUCT SEQUENCE ACTIVATED"

imb4 alien interrups self-destruct process
bah the slef destruct siren on resident evil 2 was way better
Hello Everlasting_Joy
aaaaaaand now a scene which would only be explained 30 years later in Prometheus
So all the steam in the coolant system is purging as a result
Why do i feel like a pack of cigarettes would suddenly be useful?
why are the Self Destruction Activation Systems in sci-fi films so stupidly planned?
hiya Everlasting_Joy too bad you're just in for the END of Alien
Oh God, Mike Nelson as Captain Janeway
Darf14: But what about boomer?
Hello Everlasting_Joy
hai Everlasting_Joy
#Colt_of_Personalty Think of the timezones! D:
0,14also, in case you didn't know already, Metroid was very inspired from this movie
*Starts stop watch* lets see how accurate those 10 minutes are
Allo Everlasting_Joy.
Irish_Pony Not quite. Just lost one of his/her lives
metroid was inspired by alien
Boomer will LIVE!
oh, hello Everlasting_Joy
Fire!!!
otakon: Meh, I'll live :).
5 minutes in space is MONTHS (or at least the length of a full season) according to DBZ
SaxyPretender: I can see that
Canadian_Brony: this isn't, and considering the company it was probably planned so people couldn't steal the ship
Dat extended version o_o
Zerg Creep
oh god
DArf14: YAY!!!!
SaxyPretender: Huh. The more you know.
dat nest
00,10Ohhi dallis

Laters Everlasting_Joy :)
Bwah ha ha
otakon: tell me
What the fuck...

Panda: you really don't want to know
Panda: Not just any LYra plushie. THE Lyra plushie

RustyMeat: that weapon was preorder only
Oh, Red Faction.
otakon, sagas just show me please
Omg, that is hilarious! :D
13rts isn't my thing .-.

So that is what its for

otakon: im begging you
Sumica: oh neat
TASTE THE RAINBOW MUTHAFUCKA
otakon: No the Lyra plushie. It shoots lazers
Panda: really, no. Stop askign
TASTE THE RAINBOW
derpyyy: Farting rainbows.
Panda: Just.... No.... Its a Lyra plushie with a built-it hole in the back made for a penis
nice
Rainbow Dash looks quite pale O_o
Toots!
It's mostly chilled. The guy I'm with is just staying at the office waiting for a job, so I'm allowed on my computer until we go out again.
sagas: omg that thing -.-
Am I gonna have to link to the plush again?
I'm going to get paid for my summer placement work thingie
Airpuff: Yes.... That thing....
do it :D
Lucky, I'm not getting paid :<
/me finally googles Lyra Plushie
Its not for a penis
sagas: what?
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN........AWESOME MUSIC
Granted, it's not real "work" anyway
There slippers silly filly
I got kicked last time for linking it
really derpyyy ? looooool
I wonder why
:D
:p
Well, I'm doing my thing for a month
10Drake, do you want to go into IT or something?
Dark92Enigma: just click the link?
oh that is awesome. I want one
Panda: I just told you. Its a Lyra plushie with a hole in its butt that the creator intended for a penis
that or mittens
mon-fri, 9-3:30
wtf?? oO
damn...
Art contest? Sounds fun
NO SAGAS NO
03http://i.imgur.com/CrAMN.jpg
IT IS NOT FOR A PENIS
this game looks familiar. what's it called?
03Playing Pokémon Pinball on a PS3
sagas: but why...
WHOA!
debug, red faction blankety blank
03that game looks awful on large screens
hax
It's for your golf clubs
nonono
Play it on
Gameboy player GC
:P
Derp1999, red faction blankety blank
03>PS3
Panda: He was a troll and he did it to anger bronies and make them look like perverts
Nothing in this fandom should give me nightmares - but then again, I have already read [REDACTED]
friendly fire!
03I have my GameCube at home
nice santa
03I really just want to make the most of this thing
03XD
03it's a 32GB flash drive
Pinkies4thWall For a second, i thought it was the actual background song for the playthrough! LOL
@Skylands maybe, but I've a lot to learn about the industry first before I make a decision.
03that I did my PS3 game backup on
Cypresswolf|SCP-2012: Cupcakes?
DuskStarshimmer, thanks.
The funny thing is that he offered to remove the hole if the buyer requested it
Panda: The creator hates bronies.
So was Mr. Toots a dlc thing or was it apart of the game from the begining? That would be pretty awesome considering this game came out June 2010, a few months before g4.
actually i saw a review he was apparently not even a clopper..
oidrf do you still have your 4.11 PS3?
sagas: and someone actually bought it
It sold for like 600
Panda: I think so
Om: :(
Well, I'm going to be working in a pretty professional environment, so I'm happy
A pokemon fan made that plushie? I'm so proud
i think they bought it to be funny
02I'm going into IT
03why?
sagas: That info was supposed to be classified - You know too much :O
Magnet gun is best gun
:O
10Everyone wants to
10lolredundant
sagas: wow... so... it was meant to troll bronies?
Hi Everypony
Tov|YoutubeMechanic: Which plushie?
03IT is awesome, that's why
02^
PLEASE stop the talk of the plush. I already have nightmares
Panda: He knows the most
lol
fail
sagas: :D
that plushie is terrible -.-
ppl on wcd might want one to rip SACDs
Cypresswolf|SCP-2012: Its not that bad. I enjoyed it
sexy nightmares?
02I might look into a job like Network admin or something
10Or because all of us are people with no lives who use the computer all the time
The Lyra Plushie comes with pants. Its no white dove but it still looks good.
^
Airpuff: That plushie was probably baught by a brony that will use it for different purposes
are you making things implode
Skylands that's pretty much it XD
?
Magnets - How do they work?
Like I said sumica Magnwt gun is best gun
/me 11,01dusts Tov|YoutubeMechanic
i want it for gloves.
Besides, apparently IT jobs pay pretty well.
Vat game is this?
/me dusts Nittany_Discord "You always get so dirty..."
some
sagas: ok... look... if i didnt know of the hole and that the creator was a anti brony, i would have bought it
Stallion_of_War, Red faction gurrilla
VioletVanila: YOU'RE HERE!
IT is a very broad field
xD
10IT is like, just a bit higher than working in fast food or grocery
can it run unsigned packages?
03no.
03you need CFW
03:P
Hugs
Hi Everypony
Tacos
o hi VioletVanila
Wow internet lag
so MFW didn't work?
03er
h-uh
/me hugs Vivi
10BlueFlare, "they" who?
Hm.
programming jobs play higher?
03PS3MFW requires the keys
Panda: Yeah but the creator stated pretty explicitly what its intended purpose for in its description
03same keys that sacd-ripper needs
10Jun, yes
02people who work in IT
oh
03the reason 3.55 is the higest CFW
/me gives Vivi a million wub points
10BlueFlare
03is because 3.55 is the highest with leaked keys
10that's not true
03if someone leaked 4.11 keys, we could make 4.11 CFW
03I made my own 3.55CFW earlier, so yeah
sagas: who reads descriptions :D
10stop pretending like you know what you are talking about :P
this gun is epic
Stallion_of_War: no, she deserves a BILLION
Stallion_of_War your going to crash the wub market if you keep doing that.
o-o
Do you?
02Skylands, I'm in school for IT
02>.>
Stallion_of_War: million..?!
dentists and actuaries should make lots of money, too
Magnets are fun
10IT does not make the highest wage or salary
sagas: indeed :D
Airpuff: By comparision, you get two
Huh...
That was weird
Stallion_of_War: ...
03yeah, stuff like software development makes more
10I'll be using Jun's example
10Dentists make WAY more than a basic IT employee
Mear mortals can't handle that much wubs
DUDE
well duh
Ooh.
They're dentists.
Yay for breaking the laws of entropy!
I'd turn my lyra plushie into a way I can put chalk on my pool cue.
Stallion_of_War: she is no mear mortal!
11,01sagas: I know.
/me 11,01shakes off dust
10I'm telling BlueFlare because he thinks IT makes the most
otakon: I know, that's why she can handle a million wub points
02IT makes about $20,000 - $150,000/year depending on the job.
02It’s a VERY broad category
Dat plan
All the power in the house shut off, except for the one with the internet connected.
"Broad" doesn't mean "rich"
Stallion_of_War: Are we talking vinyl scratch wubs or <3 wubs?
the thing is, noone wants to be dentists, 'cuz customers don't like you
10^
and IT itself is very broad
Om: lol.. must be fate
Om: What great luck!
sagas: both?
I thought they were the same?
02LOL. That's what I mean Drake
There's programmers, network admins, computer repairmen.
I know.
dentists also have one of the highest su*cide rates, apparently
Stallion_of_War: I can accept that
S&D
Vivi is sleeping?
actuaries are highly skilled in both maths & calc
Om: Now you have an excuse to wast time on the internet!
err
Mawwiage: Twoo wub
10My dentist is an old guy
stats & calc
brb guys
Hell, people in software tend to make more money than people in hardware, but I think people in hardware have a more reliable income.
Oh, it came back.
BOOM
d:
It *is* late in her part of the world.
okay otakon we will miss you
What a strange thing
possiblt
02Okay, let me ask you something Skylands
02do you know what IT stands for?
Vivi also gets 20% extra wubs on everything because of her beautiful voice
That repair ability is pretty cool.
inb4 it's renamed to ICT
what I am doing is somewhat IT related
Sumica: how much environment is destructable in this game?
Om it just means ur power is being gay and shiitty
Because FUCK entropy...
Yup. Apartments are great
Information Technology.
:D
02Information Technology yep
Entropy? LOL im pinkie pie
Cya HML
Idiots Telephoning
YAY DETROY
/me walks
*destroy
02http://www.cbsalary.com/blog/keyword/annual-salary <-- that should say everything
yup
02those are some common IT jobs
yes
YAY! DESTROY STUFF! :D
02and I know that some IT jobs only pay like $12/hour.
02but it's also about doing what you like
otakon: You should see the backup wubs she has from being AFB for so long! We had to invent a new number called Vivillion just to count them all!
Moar Destruction!
USE THE PONY!!!
Stallion_of_War: that's a lot of wubs
sure :D
A goose!!!
OH I LIKE HOLES
10Cool
Pinkies4thWall: :D wow
/me reminds Pinkies4thWall of the Lyra plushie
*black hole
just watched the pilot of angel beasts, it was awsome
SHAME SAGA
dammit
Pinkies4thWall: well you did mention loving holes....
sagas: not that kind of hole!
lyra plushie is Om's fav hole ^^
well, it wasn't specified
/me crawls into the Lyra plushie
/me PING!s
Stallion_of_War: hahahaahahahahaha
sagas, i have little tolerance for antagonistic behavior such as that
Panda: Better than your faveorite.
13i was much more bland when i did a lab with routers.... named them after doom 3 labs >>
:3
13delta was the one designated to fail ofc
Or was one named Sumica ... can't remember
Om: what my fav? O////o om plushie?
Pinkies4thWall: Sorry it was too good of a joke to pass up on
>_(\
sagas: no. that was a BAD joke
Shizuka: but you werent mods back then ^^
Pinkies4thWall: You know it was funny
Too bad they were virtual routers, or I could have actually dusted Nittany_Discord :D
02Also, low salary is to be expected whenever you’re new in a career
no. it was more insulting than funny
brb
Pinkies4thWall: Its okay. Obscene things can be funny
:(
Why is my Skyrim updating?
./)
will angel beasts have any more shows, or is it offically cancelled?
Why do you think I'm doing work placement.
Sumica, how can you shoot so many women and children?!!
Stallion_of_War: Because Bethesda wants it to
Easy
Just don't lead 'em so much, ponibas
score!
If I can barely stand Pizza Hut for money do you really think I could have a career I dislike even if I'm being paid $150,000+?
/me brohoofs ponibas
late =p
sagas: Is it going to give me DLC content?
sagas: don't let me catch you doing it agian
PING!
*again

/me hugs Pinkies4thWall back
Skylands, go finish the Articuno merchandise page, now.
0,14I had rice with beef and a salad
02[19:27] <Skylands> IT is like, just a bit higher than working in fast food or grocery <-- fast food only makes like $7.50/hour LOL
Om: something the matter?
0,14a MANLY dinner
02old but I just had to say something
Otherwise I'll drone on about all my problems to you.
/me is interested in SaxyPretender's dinner
SaxyPretender: no... take off the salad :D
SaxyPretender: Sounds delcious
All my diners are manly dinners
10Meh
Especially my Brian Blessed style JAM SANDWICHES
10There's so many more items to be added on this page than the others
SaxyPretender: Im so hungry now, I would do almost anything for that meal right now
Do it now so you don't have to later.
Panda: That yours?
Panda: Ponify ALL THE THINGS
sagas: i wish and Pinkies4thWall hehe i know right :D

Ponify is best script

Potty break!

02also, who are you doing work placement for Drake?

Misses cole...........*scrunches up paper*. A goose!!!!
Who is the air bending pony, Panda?
ELEPHANTS ARE RUNNING ACROSS THE FLOOR UPSTAIRS!
Cypresswolf|SCP-2012: nipped cat is best cat?
or is that my sisters??
guys, what is this?
Pinkies4thWall: Yesh! ^_^
hi :/
i once spilled almost a cup of catnip on the floor
Guys, what should I name my AR-15?
Buddy went BATSHIT BERSERK
Yay your back CCCP!
sagas: the airbender pony? uh...kora?
hi sagas
/me hiugs CCCP
Ponybender is best bender, cuz they can bend ponies out of thin air. :3
Assassin's Creed II removes the HUD for screenshots automatically?!?!
/me hugs sagas back
sweet!
and now she's silent cat - in a paper bag
Panda: But Korra isnt an air bender yet and shes from the water tribe?
CriticKitten: oh gosh i wish I could pony bend ^^
Lalalalalalalaaaaaaa
sagas: thats not air its water btw
Cypresswolf|SCP-2012: did you see my previous 2 comments?
sagas: Technically she is an airbender, she just has a bending block
02oh, I just read up
02derp :x
Panda: Oh that makes more sense. I feel she should have her own Avatar-esque cutie mark symbolizing all 4
Hello Everypony !
sagas: eeeenope :D
Alister: :D hiya
hi Alister
Hello Alister
Panda: Inorite
:3
Hello Alister! Hows your day been?
Dat ban
Pinkies4thWall: :D - My cat tried to knock the entire container out of my hand when I was sprinkling it earlier - and jam her whole head into it
sagas: Glowy eyeballs?
yay
There are only two guys but I don't mind.
hi Alister
JRP2234[iPhone]: Who got baned?
sagas: just ok , kinda boring at school
Sector Q
Stallion_of_War: ?
Cypresswolf|SCP-2012: she needs to be medicated
Hey Alister

Alister: Still at school in June?

And speaking of Avatar, I still gotta watch the new one, don't I? Whoops. XD
I'm back

I would be playing God of War III right now IF THE REFUB WORKED!
Stallion_of_War: Oh I was thinking like a circle with each element as a quarter

02work placement might be a good idea for this summer
Alister: hey...
02although I do already know what they do
FlareChaser: hey.. ? what's the matter Flarey ?
Pinkies4thWall: I think my cat has been over medicated - she's crazy all the time, actually a bit more mellow with cat nip...
hiya FlareChaser
08,01sagas: just not feeling very sociable
Cypresswolf|SCP-2012: is she fixed?
08,01but also kinda lonely
