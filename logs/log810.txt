i got a question about movies
Almost ded
13Mike: You can stop spamming now.
Me and scanty dont follow Rururu's either
Squallken: ask away~
Shizuka: Sorry, boredom is spreading
allright
13then be bored somewhere else
That death scream
oh hey its BlitzenAngel
Shits on fire yo
BlitzenAngel: Wilhelm Scream. That is all.
WAIT
WUT
i shall take BlitzenAngel away
13suigintou what are you worried about, you've mastered levitation if your top half isn't connected to your bottom half
Dont do eeet
13you should be happy
13oh
Bronysmith: Didn't I tie you to the wall?
13never mind
I was looking threw the list of movies Bronystate has but on, do movies labled with "C" C-movies, are they never allowed to be played again?
DED
13Squallken: yes
put* on
Like Babes in Toyland
:3
13and epic fail
Squallken: C movies? depends if it past the 6 month period
and Epic Movie
Later everypony :3
Bye Ponies47 :)
bye
I understand Epic Movie (and those like it) but Babes in toy land?
jingle bells batman smells
HEY! Rozen Maiden... which season?
Squallken: yep
its that bad
13last ep season 1
Yep, WMC movies are the best movies though.
I ahvent seen this in YEARS
No the best movies are borderline WMC, but can be joked about
like MegaShark vs Giant Octopus
What if I have no religion, BlitzenAngel?
BlitzenAngel: Applebells?
13festivus poles for everyone!
BlitzenAngel: lets not talk or get into religion, dont want to start a flamewar
:S
Oh, when is the news letter coming out? I want to enter the survey to have my movie choosen
Squallken: "C" movies survive-- but are rarekly requested. WMC covers movies that EVERYONE WHO WATCHED THE STREAM agreed tat they shuld never darken our monotors again.
DashWithRainbows: Then... uh... fish
there
13five minutes into epic movie we knew it would be WMC
I dislike fish >:l
idk I thought Babes in Toyland was funny, bad but funny
BlitzenAngel: ...CRAP I CAN'T THINK OF ONE! can i get some help?
he has magical fingers that make her happy
Tis the season to be naughty falalalalalalalala
Shizuka: what is WMC?
Shizuka: pre-showing i already knew it was going to get WMC'd
13JUN
Nauughty~
RDash5000: Uh... Yours is tough
13WHEN A GIRL ASKS YOU TO BRUSHIE BRUSHIE
13YOU SAY YES
thelonepony: i like naughty
id touch her hair all ngiht long
same~ ;)
Shizuka: are you asking to brushie brushie?
BRUSHIE BRUSHIE!
WMC is like having every tooth pulled out of your head. I know. That happened to me, and now I wear dentures.
13jun is now a brony
BlitzenAngel: might have to make a new one from scratch
now this must be redubbed with PONIES
xD
Shizuka: When ANYONE asks for brushie brushie, you say yes
Squallken: die, for bringing that up
If I ever have twins, I'm going to split them from birth, and I will always tell them that they have an evil twin, and that they will need to train so they may fight to the death. At their eighteenth birthday, I will give them a good luck and push both of them into the Chucky Cheese ball pit then lock it shut.
ok ok ill shut up
Mike: the hell is wrong with you?
you know what? EGGNOG5000 BITCHES
...
/me protects otakon from the stupid Mike
Is that a dolly in your pocket or are you just glad to- OH GOD STOP HITTING ME

otakon: I guess I'll have to turn them from 1080p to 720p. First world problems
/me uses otakon as a guard from the feels
i always watch on 360 anyway
/me slaps BlitzenAngel around a bit with a large trout

13hey that's my chair pose haruhi
13get your own
shizuka, I know you have said in the past you have no plans to show the movie of this..... but it would be a good addition to one of your streams
You. Now.
13for those confused, japanese buildings are rarely heated because of the summers
00,10george george; george of the jungle
:D
13buildings are designed to be very open and ventilated, which makes winter way cold
watch out for that tree
Sumica: irrelevant
13< is it me or did yuki look much older in that profile shot
Shizuka: depends on where in japan you are, tokyo is the main location for these shows however
00,10clealy you did not hear the base line from it in this song
Shizuka: she did look much older
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: Proud to be a Brony
awwwww
Sumica: Hmmm. I am not paying attention to the stream, so yeah.
00,10then how would you know irrelvancy?
Sumica: It was irrelevant to the current conversation/stream.
oh dear
Besides the bassline
00,10the stream you said you were not watching.
Haruhi is Les Yay for Mikuru
I wanna drink eggnog
Sumica: Define not watching.
did she just ask if she got bigger?
Kneesocks: you and me both.
O_o yeah definitely Les Yay
Sumica maybe he is so irrelevant he can sense something he is not even watching
yay fan service bunny suit
Sumica: I have it up, along with the chat, I'm just not paying attention.
00,10clealy a god among men
EggNog5000: Yay
ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD MASK
Kneesocks: i kinda have an unhealthy addiction to eggnog...
is eggnog alcoholic?
Poor Mikuru
twilight_sprinkle: it can be
I have some in mah fridge
hm k
twilight_sprinkle: not by default
twilight_sprinkle: only the alcoholic kind.
eggnog drinking eggnog? cannibalism?
suddenly Kero?
kk, then imma buy me some nonalcoholic eggnog
DAMMIT SHOW STOP TEASING US!
13yuki just broke the fourth wall
;_;
13looked the audience in the eye like "WHAT you pervs want to see that stuff?"
animes have to have delicious 4th wall breaking
otakon stop looking after 14 years old anime girls
i think im going to explode otakon s general vacinity in 50 seconds
better run
no thanks
/me takes cover
1, 2, skip a few

AIEOU
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: You haven't seen the good kind yet
SHUT UP
that still scene
Mike and you have ?
twilight_sprinkle: John Madden
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Maybe
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
999
Mike i'll take that as a no
ASS
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: get guild wars 2

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: e621. That is all.

basukimen ASS
Bronysith nah i wanted at first but i would not play it enough
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: fair enough
yay filler..
...
meow mix
Mike so you are basicly telling me to go watch porn ?
13this shot alone is saving so much monty
i guess that's what happens when you hit f5
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: sounds about right, id suggest not listening to him
so is there any point to this?
hot pot
lololol
nope
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: e621 isn't videos, it's a site of all around porn imagery.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: It has all.
13Enough.
13You start discussing porn I'll ban you faster than you can say "but wait".
What is a bit off to us-- is this is exactly how Japanese Standup works. And they love it.
it ain't me the one directing people to that page but i'll shut up
13i know trixie
13this guy's been riding the line all night
13Mike: Shape up or GTFO.
Mike: you must be new here, post ponies
/me protects RoboGerbil from the bad Mike
not really something to say with the site he's been bringing up...
RoboGerbil newfoals can't poni
Shizuka: TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Usually my antics bring more lulz than hate. This night I'm off on that scale.
/me glomps kirzstryfe
kirzstryfe: oi, whats going on?
FEGELEIN!
oh hai kirz
00,10it must have a negitave range
hey
13suddenly kirz
The only one allow to do anything like that is Lyra`, Mike
:)
/me shields kirzstryfe
13you're just in time for the feels
Shizuka: hes mine
working on a picture, so no stream atm
sup kirzstryfe
Hai kirzstryfe
hui kirz
hiya kirz|art
hoi kirz|art
oh look the camcorder is back out
hi kirz
Hey guys. Street Fighter x Mega Man game tomorrow.
fire hazard that one, no ground prong on the plug or on the outlet

Bushed
the game comes out
Dat card game
13haruhi being caring
13BUSTED
/me glomps otakon onto kirz|art
these guys are mine~
kirz|art: hiya man
so many outfits
00,02ohai kirz|art
/me glomps Phase4 as well
I seem to have a range of confrontation with bronystate.
0hai Phase4 :3
Nice colors Phase4
Mike: why is that?
Mike: considering you broke like 3 rules in 5 seconds
kinda funny that movie has the role reversal
00,02and then everyone noticed
we cant allow this to happen
last time I was neutral when we were watching FLoyd
:3
13trademark kyon facepalm
Don't like colors Phase4?
Phase4: y u take cloths off?
awwwww
The time before was pitiful because of talking about dying dogs
13and that was haruhi
heh shes getting wet gaiz
and several before that varying from lulz-bringing to hate, ounting today.
that screen shot
wait....That was the ending?
13so
13have your kleenex ready?
feels?
for season one it was
my eyes are ready, my body isn't
13that was chronologically the last ep of haruhi
first time i heard about haruhi was about a Carameldansen video
I SHALL GATHER THE BUCKETS
my feels wont happen
that was kind of wimpy for an ending
i may be gone for awhile :\
00,10that's not carmadansen though Bronysith
Mike: It's really simple. We're dealing with a wide range here. Including, at times, even kids. So, we have rules. You should READ THEM. Just a suggestion.
actually heres the question...was that the last story for the first novel Shizuka?
/me steals Sumica s shins
13iunno
i'd have check that
00,10that came from a diffrent show
13and now
/me smashes Sumica s shins
13feels: the motion picture
omg noooooo not the feels!!
my body is ready
must hide!!
00,10this dont look like Air
Kencolt: I read them. I find my actions flow with the conversation.
the most powerful of feels
Ponyo time
yay! Sumica agrees that Air gives the massive feels
00,10the I was keeping up with traffic excuse wont work with cops either Mike
i dont want the feels!! :'(
Mike: Just trust the davice of your elders. And believe me-- I AM you elder. Heck. here, I'm pretty much everyone's elder.
hell, any key visual novel turned anime, minus little buters, gives massive feels
13unless you use a bus sumica
fuck school!
*little busters
goodbye... maybe for awhile :\
don't be sure of that kencolt, there are some elders in here
Kencolt: I am aware of your age and being my 40 year superior.
I'm 55.
ewwwwwww anime
I hate anime
13ew a teenager
then leave
the_real_pony_1604: I'm fairly secure in that.
..
fine then cya for ever bronies
i though teenagers loved anime
okay, you win aganst my 32
http://imgur.com/VXqIe,OD5Zs
Sumica: Wasn't an excuse, but an explanation. I wasn't trying to get out of anything, I know i was guity of said charges, just explaining.
remind me again how many series shown in the states are animated overseas
Mike: ground youself to release said charges
/me takes twilight_sprinkle to bed
twilight_sprinkle: wat
get it? ground? charges? eh....
Mike: terrible physics humor
twilight_sprinkle: ah i get it nao
/me takes twilight_sprinkle to bed for punishment
Goldframe: THe majority, these days, are key-animated here, and filler-animated overseas. Others are imports entirely. MLP is, in fact, unusual in that it's entirely animated on the NA continent.
Bronysith: but i dont wanna .-.
twilight_sprinkle: I was assuming it wasn't a pun
Goldframe: Then again, apparently, it's alsothe first time anyone used Flash to good effect.
true
needs more persona
Kencolt: WHat about Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends? Didn't that use flash well?
and it is a....... bad name
Korea, in fact, has a HUGE in-betweener animation industry. Japan and the US use various studios that fill in the bits-- and very well, indeed.
Mike: Yes-- but not to the almost insane intent that MLP has. You catually get, often a 3D effect in obviously 2D animation, almost unprecidented in Flash.
well black wings
i'm getting lag herre and there. What's happening to her wings?
lovely
AssaultWithEmbraces: she's "sin-bound"
guilt of what?
/me s shadow enlarges over otakon
no
sin-bound?
How/
no idea
Kencolt: Sweet.
I read it from the wiki
/me shadow gets bigger over otakon
I've missed most of it sadly
my damn stream keeps skipping
13it means you haven't been forgiven for what you did before becoming a haibane
HAAAAAAAAAM
/me air crash glomps otakon
/me dodges smoothly
was it revealed yet what she did?
oh that must be it
/me emits nuclear fallout
she was run down by a train
Bronysmith: No physics breaking
I keep looking at spinzaku gifs
spinzaku gifs ftw
xD
/me puts otakon in a blender
I don't blend
what is rakkas sin?
/me drags Bronysmith to the glue factory
no idea
so this is another purgatory anime?
13Mike: You're done. I'm not going to warn you again.
goodnight guys.
Mike: dude you might want to stop
night EggNog5000
bye EggNog5000
Bye EggNog5000
i must not know something about glue factories..
Night eggnog
twilight_sprinkle: glue is made from animal bones, usually horses or pigs
See? Nopony listens to their elders.
Shizuka: I'm sorry, then, for wanting bronysmith to stop with the endless /me
Kencolt: no offense, but age isnt everything you know
otakon: is howls moving castle any good?
yes
Bronysith: Iliked it
yes it is
well it IS miyazaki >.>
Bronysmith: Howls moing castle is awesome. Watch it.
well that's creepy
twilight_sprinkle: It's all I GOT. I don't have my teeth, a proper nervous system, and one of my hips is fake. My eyes suck. Age is my main thing.
what the hell?
I DONT EVEN!?!?
Mike: faggot
Bronysith: stop that, he's right it is a good movie
twilight_sprinkle: That and s few experiences that aren't shared here-- but I'm willing to share.
what happened to her?
Kencolt: well, whats important is knowledge and morals, not age :P
Bronysmith: Pls stahp
did she take off her wings or something?
i dont even know!
Lyra`: she's sin-bound, basically means she's not been forgiven for her sins in her past life
:o
Mike: you keep purposely mispelling my name, you stop
I have no idea how this show really works though
oh, okay :3
I've missed most of it
/me pushes EVA-02 ontop of Mike
taylor smith
Kencolt: not saying you dont ave those, just saying its whats important
/me grabs twilight_sprinkle and takes off in megas
if you reference anime, chances are, youre a twat muffin
*popular
13Bronysith: Stop spamming please.
Wait... I didn't even notice that. Sorry.
Shizuka: yes mam
twilight_sprinkle: And as for knowledge? Heh. I'm the guy who fills in the holes. A lot. But hey-- mainly I'm old (for here).
Kencolt: Innuendos are fun.
Push meAnd then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction Push me And then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction Push me And then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Push me And then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Push me And then just touch me Till I can get my satisfaction Satisfaction
Kencolt: well again no offense,but remember to keep a bit of modesrt too
asdf
holy fucking shit
Dat spam
13...
*modesty
twilight_sprinkle: Not as old as Granny Smith. She's as old as dirt. I'm only as old as rocks-- I haven't been ground that fine yet.
god
what in the hell is going on here tonight
Why is chat always bad when Shizuka streams?
13ponies starting to work out what reki did
whoever references bad music needs to die by the glorious satanic powers of ham
Buytoast: run
Buytoast: I know right...
Kencolt: Rocks are younger than dirt because dirt is squished and melted to make rocks.
I do admit though, Satisfaction is one of Ben Benassis more interesting works
i mean i know it's still the weakend but i mean c'mon, it's the last vestiges of it
Oh no
She's not going to
Mike: Geologically unsound. "Squish" and "Melted" only leads to Composite and INcindiary rocks. Dirt comes from the slow erosion and crumbling of stone and rock. You argument is incorrect.
darnit
bitches need to stop breaking
Buytoast: nothings really going on
Buytoast: I think Shizuka is less lenient to me than the other mods, thus protecting me from bringing lulz
slime train?
Shizuka doesnt tollerate my shit
THE FUCK IS TAHT THIGN!?
i love it :3
NOOOO
Kencolt: Your argument was flawed from the start.
otakon: whats ur fav miyazaki film?
well shit, she angered the Smokey Progg
her wings are white again
that's what you get
13DerpyMuffins: I'm starting to wonder myself. Makes me want to not stream.
Bronysith: Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind
Mike: It would bere, were it an argument. INstead, it's an established scientific definition. Look it up.
otakon: dafuq
Bronysith: dude it's like one of his best movies
actually no my favorite is Spirited Away
otakon: i gotcha, just the name, dafuq
otakon: spirited away and princess mononoke are my favs
god they are so fucked up
Shizuka, have you seen madoaka magica?
ennething by miyazaki is fucked up
has she been forgiven?
or otakon, really, whoever wants to respoond
*respond
and for some reason people love him for that
Kencolt: Impossible. Your starting statement completely implies all dirt is older than rocks.
13AssaultWithEmbraces: as pointed out in the previous episode, you can't forgive yourself, someone with the reason to has to forgive you
so where did she go?
13on
heaven level 2?
Mike: The opposite. I stated that I was younger than dirt, because I had not been ground down yet. Ever check you reading comprehension skills? Because, seriously-- you aren't reading what I'm writing.
lol
13i think mike is just trying to start a fight
best use of halo
you saying mike is startin?
oi gendo
stop startin
Kencolt: We're arguing exactly the same thing.
twilight_sprinkle: your mums a slag
Mike: IN other words, dirt is older than rocks-- yes. BECAUSE IT GOT GROUND DOWN. But they are technically the same age, at the core.
HARUMPH
Bronysith: no, yer ma's the slag!
twilight_sprinkle: oi you startin something?
Bronysith: oi start stoppin
Dont be startin with me, im the fookin japanese military
Kencolt: >Not as old as Granny Smith. She's as old as dirt. I'm only as old as rocks-- I haven't been ground that fine yet.
so is this girl not forgiven yet?
Precisely.
Kencolt: We're arguing the same thing.
Mike: the fact that you bring ponies into your arguement about rocks and dirt upsets me
13being forgiven removes the black mark of being sin-bound
13but you don't leave the town until you're ready
ah ok
that makes more sense
Shizuka: god why is this so feels?
so, I guess they hang around and talk to each other, until someone finds a reason to forgive the other?
that was touching. THanks for playing it.
hi
i have a feeling that my wings would be like a negative of dalmation print
lol
13in case you missed the earlier eps, it's strongly implied that the dream a haibane has in the cocoon is their last moments somewhere else
pretty much Tassadork lol
13so given that, three guesses how reki ended up here
13and the first two don't count
jumped from a plane?
it's called skydiving
whos streeming next??
oh no, Shizuka is leaving us
well, there is alot to be said about Rakka also
its called tactical insertion
if reki is the main girl that is
Kencolt: Dirt is ground up rock, at the simplest explanation. Rock in itself, is dirt, compacted or solidified from a solution.
Lyra`: ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
Thank you for the stream Shizuka.
welp thanks for the stream Shizuka
Mike: so...dirt is dirt huh?
nope
hi
00,10nice stream Shizuka
hello vinyl-scartch
Thanks Shizuka
Thankies for the stream, Shizuka
thankies Shizuka
no, dirt is ground up rock if organic material in it
hi vinyl-scartch
also I'm gonna vote "Meet the Feebles" for B
oi Sumica are you the fookin japanese military?
what sre we watching
otakon: die
Thanks for the stream shizu
Bronysith: nto yet :3
dont see how else she couldve ended up falling from that height other than a plane
Sorry if chat wasn't with par with your expectations Shizuka
Shizuka: Face it. It's another one of those nice, moving, and often WTF animes you are so enamoured of... for which I am usually thankful. Good stream, but I must admit, I never got into Haibane.
cliff
otakon: i know, i swtill have use of you
00,10Stop start'en Bronysith
13i have pretty low expectations of mane chat but it always manages to sneak under it
13Kencolt: innit though :)
Sumica: still gettin that for ya man, from the bastard himself
vinyl-scartch: we are watching shizuka's outro video thing
Shizuka, thanks for streaming.
Shizuka: hey how about something out there next time... maybe like PS&G?
but yeah thanks for stream Shizuka
^
13the moving ones are what i keep in my library, the more mainstream ones like bebop and death note i get through like once and never go back
I may have to actually watch Haibane from the start
otakon: whats with you and gainax?
13stand alone complex being the exception because tech
you still have expectations for this chat?
we need to fully watch code geass, we always stop at 8 eps or so
it has a lot of feels too
Bronysith: what? I like PS&G
otakon: gainax is the DAFUQ of anime
GitS: SAC was a good series
Buytoast: at least for some people
excuse me while I die from happiness
Bronysith: not all the time
Shizuka: And yet, you have yet to show Lain.
and then THE PADDLIN'
otakon: most of their shit is DAFUQ
13true that... i grabbed lain once but was too wtf'd out in the first episode
Bronysith: Evangelion was the only real one
and then that SuperBrony64 stream :3
Lain = WTF
13might have to reacquire some time
Kandarihu: Assuming we are watching and paying attention.
MY FANFICTION IS ACTUALLY GETTING ATTENTION!!
weeping_pegasi82: yay for you
otakon: anytime you watch something of gainax you will say dafuq in 1(confusion, 2(utter awesomeness 3(what the hell is going on
yes yes yes yes yes
meh, eva is the best thing that company made
weeping_pegasi82: want a cookie?
Bronysith: FLCL evokes all three
yes yes yes... yes
psh
twilight_sprinkle: LIES
GunBuster
sorry just excited
twilight_sprinkle: Gurren Lagann
Shizuka: The thing about Lain is... well... it actually starts to make total coherent sense. IF you can see it.
Goldframe: Gunbuster is good too
you should show dokoru for the lulz one night
otakon: i didnt like gurren lagann, or die buster or gun buster
twilight_sprinkle: O_O
/me shuns twilight_sprinkle
Shizuka, when do you find time to sleep?
HOW CAN YOU DENY HOT BLOODED NESS!?
but eva was pretty good
otakon: i cant watch FLCL
What if... we DIDNT STREAM ANIME o_0
Bronysith: why not? it's awesome
otakon: because i dont like purely hot bloodedness
otakon: cause i ate my own hand
13still need to get ffsplit to work with ustream, need moar gaming with this embed
lol u srs?
Bronysith: .... dammit
Abenobashi is more WTF than FLCL
otakon: if it had more to offer then i would like it, but it doesnt
otakon: i ate my own hand and then it grew out of my head, i couldnt watch it anymore
twilight_sprinkle: okay for ONE Gunbuster is NOT pure hotbloodness so your argument in invalid
yeah, and abenobashi has full frontal underage nudity
Bronysith: you need help, I'm putting you back in regulars for therapy
at least with FLCL you can keep track of what's going on
Shizuka, next time I see you streaming Left 4 Dead, I'm going to send you a friend invite.
otakon: you put me in there and ill kill you in your sleep with a wrench
the_real_pony_1604: really? I have it, I never noticed under age frontal nudity
otakon: well all of those shows have attempts at a providing more, but i didnt like them
the boy, full frontal at one point
Mike: bah scrub, i can pay attention to chat and dubs
Goldframe: Even if you have no idea WHAT is going on, in FLCL you can keep track. You're just never certain of what you're keeping track OF>
the_real_pony_1604: you'd think I would remember that
but I like Abenobashi
hell I think I'll pick it up on BLuray if they have it
Mike: you need more varying exposure to bronystate streams
Gurren lagann is probably my fav work of gainax
it is just a flash of it right around the bathhouse episode
otakon: Get on my level, pleeb
Gurren lagann is my fav anime, with NGE in a close second...i have no idea why NGE is in my top three though
Mike: what is that supposed to mean?
otakon: i dont get it, i dont understand why NGE is in my top three fav animes
eva has glorious mindbuckery which is why i enjoy it
after the bathhouse explodes or whatever. it is just a floor and some busted walls
Bronysith: no idea
Mike: The first rule of Bronystate is you are at the mercy of the Mods, except on late Fridays and Saturday afternoons. Any other time-- there is NO TELLING WHAT SHOWS.
daris streams <3333
anyway brb, need to hit the john
have not seen it for years but I remember finding it odd back in the day
13well we really only have six streamers
otakon: cause it is indeed a good anime, but not the best, maybe cause it is really fuckgin serious
13used to have more
speaking of Evangelion
Shizuka: who are the streamers?
what does it take to become a streamer?
when the hell is 3.33 out?
i need my depression
DCD didnt restream JOJO on thursday ;_;
Mike: Try making it for a Vivi stream if she ever comes back
Otakon: I was referring to the ridiculousness of the word scrub
13Bronysith: it's already out in japan
13 favorites in 2 days!! *squee!*
in the states? 2-3 years
13will hit australia first in 2013 then finally get over here
hey I used to live in australia!
Shizuka: yay, i cant wait to see it
Shizuka: i would stream if someone let me :)
13imdb has an unconfirmed release range of january 2013 for the states, but will probably much later be
goddamnit
ah well
ooh, january would be nice
at least ill have guild wars 2 and PSO2 to satiate my wait for 3.33
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/img/as_spy.png
13rebuild 2 dvd took like a year to make it over here
I am setup for streaming but no one wants to watch me play minecraft. HAHAH
00,10pssssssss, Shizuka
im listening to eva 3.33 ost right now :3
Kencolt: Also, wat, by varying streams I thought he meant different streamers. that was irrelevant.
Shizuka, why does australia get stuff like that first
its wierd
we already watch someone play minecraft twice a week
13oh also sumica, new camrip on that site i linked you before
00,10dibs~
13:P
Good morning everypony :)
00,10lost said link
hoi NocturnalBlade
its hilarious how the nostalgia critic got blown to hell by the guy who voiced shinji
hello NocturnalBlade
Oh, wel.... have to check a few boards, do a couple of dailies I've been leting slack... laters.
this one Sumica http://www.youcannotredo.com/ ?
Bronysith: lol nice
13soundtrack is up to FLAC level too
NocturnalBlade: It's 11 pm in minnesota.
/me waves.
13yep that one
oh dammit I haven't dl'd the new ep yet
Mike: 12 o clock here lol
TO EQD
Lyra`: no why?
bye ken
otakon, do you listen to tegan and sara?
cya ken, hope for more comflicts.
otakon, do you drink out of a nalgene bottle?
/me hugs Mike twilight_sprinkle and texasboykc09
goddamnit why do i like Evangelion, i seriously dont understand why it is so popular
Bronysith: because mindbuckery
if you answered yes, to two or more of those questions, you might be a lesbian.
Lyra`: ... where have I heard these before?
science doesnt lie.
most likely cause it has hot girls in skin tight clothing and "mechs"
Lyra`: ...Spinnerette?
yup :D
lol you read it too?
my favorite page of that comic <3
00,10unit 02-dash.......I see that geting used
you know i do!
lol
NocturnalBlade: I seem to be hated today because Shizuka is less lenient. Thank you for that.
I like it
best lesbian super hero EVER!
13Mike: Or it could be because you're trying to provoke everyone
one of the few apparently
Mike: what you mean?
and shes not a lesbian super hero. shes just a super hero. who happens to like girls.
Shizuka: I'm pointing out flaws. It's their decision whether to reply.
Mike, don't point out flaws. It doesn't come out pretty.
^
i learned that the hard way
NocturnalBlade: Bronysith was spamming and I tried to mess with him, which Shizuka didn't approve of.
meh
mike, just add an extra I to your name
ESPECIALLY if the flaws are about a person. Then you just asked for trouble.
and the word snow
become, Miike Snow
i cant agree with that AssaultWithEmbraces
Mike: you revealed PM logs
while in this case it felt like Mike did go overboard
^
and it felt more like trolling tbh
yeah dude that's messed up
and revealing pm logs in mane chat is something im personally against too
Mike: disclosing pms are against network ToS, you /could/ be k-lined
PM logs are sacred
hell even LYRA knows that
Bronysith: Ah. My memory of rules tends to be hazy, you know.
Mike: no excuses, you should be lucky you weren't banned
Mike: ignorance is no excuse for lawbreaking
mostly because if my PM logs got out, i might go to jail >.> <.<
Lyra`: same
Lyra`: .... you scare me sometimes filly
hey, its legal in australia
but still AssaultWithEmbraces ,i cant agree with not revealing flwas. people should accept that they have flaws and try to improve it. like my parents told me, people who truly care about you will tell you about your flaws, others will just play along
Lyra`is crazy but likeable ^_^
otakon: sometimes?
thanks NocturnalBlade :D
Otakon: Again, I'm not pleading not guilty with this.
otakon: shes like the female version of me
twilight_sprinkle: I know. But revealing a person's flaws for the purpose of making fun of them is what I was getting at.
...
oh hell no, Bronysith
no Bronysith she is WAY beyond your level of odd
:D
How's that slurping Blade.
otakon: hence why i love her
well good for you
Jmo: do what now?
with a bit of saxton hale thrown in.
Lyra`: So you're a tiny head with a big nose?
NocturnalBlade: i think hes saying youre sucking up
Ding ding ding ding.
We have a winner.
mike, dont cross me.
but i dont see whats the point of sucking up to an ordinary user
so i dont think he is
Lyra`: Sorry, couldn't resist.
:3
otakon: i think we need to take cover
unless im unaware of something
no
twilight_sprinkle: ah
no we don't
or evil older sister?
and that scares me
we do
hell speaking of him, anyone hear from the silly Scot today?
not today
my aussie powers werent tingling so i dont think he got on
i think he was on a bit today but im not sur
Well. Signing off. Bai.
bye Mike
good ridance
good riddance
YOU FUCKIGN NINJA
herdmiiiind

CriticKitten: run

CriticKitten, hai :3

Well it's not me, obviously, I'm never wrong.
Shizuka: PULEASE. Ive known dis bizwitch long enough

Sumica: DO IT
id rather not see it

what up CriticKitten
twilight_sprinkle: shut up and enjoy one of the most overrated animes ever
Nasty cough. Won't go away. 'tis part of being a sickly lil' thing.
13doitdoitdoitdoit
Shizuka: i knew you would say that
13just not the camrip, still pretty bleh quality and looks like it's on its side
Bronysith: but spoilers will make that harder
word for word
twilight_sprinkle: ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
but eh i dont really care for spoilers that much, so i guess whatevs
i read that as *catnip, Shizuka
Bronysith: ...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcrga9bBj7o&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=142
this entire chat is just like
beep boop
imma cloud
entire chat is ded
all the juice is gone
everything is made of rubber
and before you even ask
yes
not the juice
yes it is
The juice was gone before you frikkin began drinking
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEROYYYYYY!
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: how goes paying 15 dollars a month?
Good
Mmm, much better. Cough medicine tastes nasty, but it at least helps with that dry throat feeling. ^^
guild wars 2 has the potential to destroy wow
AHAHAHA
No it doesn't
Oh everyone fucking says that about EVERY new MMO
It gets fucking old
MMO?
i know XD
Massive multiplayer online
I don't even care too much about WoW anymore but even I know nothing can kill WoW.
Besides, it's doing that fine on its own.
They said that about The Old Republic didnt they?
<3
what?
GW2's player count is already dropping, and they didn't even break three mil. But it's doing well enough and I'm happy with it. :p
TOR killing wow? even then i knew was bullshit
Blizzard is almost as evil as EA
<3 <3 <3
Except Blizzard actually semi cares for its players
Activision-Blizzard you mean
gawd, that was funny when that happened
TOR was never gonna kill WoW either, because it IS WoW
KrazyNoobs: dont go breakin my heart now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLeqLaIFNx0&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=149 Go go His World
Well yeah, the Old republic basically copy and pasted wow's abilities into its game.
Even the interface is identical, seriously, they made NO efforts to conceal it.
yay
a video
CriticKitten: That bad huh?
dat sumi?
eeyup
hmm....should i or should i not...
Shizuka: get your plot in here
Spade: It's got a "retro" mode for the interface that is identical to WoW's.
I dont want to sound blind but I have not seen one MMO that felt like it could tear me away from WoW
....
the hell is this?
That's about as blatant as it gets
otakon: sneak peak of 3.33
first six minutes of Eva 3.0
who is streaming?

00,10it's the new build of Kerbal
Sumica:

00,10docking the hard way
so the whole world is tang now?
no
13asuka just committed an orbital GET OVER HERE pull
otherwise they would be too
DerpyMuffins: bye
Why is The Hub hiding information on Season 3 Episode 8?
the whole world looks like it is tang otakon
13well
00,02needs more engines
13shinji did kick off third impact at the end of rebuild 32
13er
132

00,02why would you turn off the engines

Shizuka: he got kaput though
Shizuka: just so he could get some of that rei
13she just needs to slow it down for reentry it seems
00,02Sumica, NEEDS MORE ENGINES
13THIS THEME
13SO MUCH
besides they got ground crew
oh yes this theme~
lol im rocking out to "I will survive
<--- Which version is this?

goddamnit i love gainax
otakon: actually i love/hate gainax

13remember
13you feel every hit the eva takes
eeyup

13so yeah
Earth is best tang
Awesome

GODDAMMIT GAINAX
otakon: WELCOME TO EVANGELION i will be your host

DAMMIT
Except that Asuka is alive.
/me flips table
shizu, just pray that they don't screw it like like they did with End of Eva
13TheGreatAndPowerfulT: 13 minute camrip is out from somewhere in the middle of the movie, 30 minute camrip is out near the end, both are pretty awful quality
otakon: need i repeat myself a 3rd time?
Sumica: show Dead Leaves please, I need random to clear my head
SUMIADVENTURES
oi Phase4 i can haz pm?
otakon: its gainax, what can you expect
Sumica: So what crazy shenanigans are we getting into today?
otakon: probably one of the best anime companies out there...god why do they piss us off
00,02twilight_sprinkle, asking to pm someone kinda riuins the whole private thing
hello Sumica
screw dead leaves, redline
Heading to bed. Cough's still there but not as bad, hoping will be gone by tomorrow.
Sumica: I found one on YT a while back, hold on I'll see if it's any good
Phase4: well i just wanted to make sure you were here :P
Goldframe: we've seen it like 500 times though
So any ideas what shenanigans Sumica is going to be up to tonight?
Swingset
probably BUStin up some innocent people
Since I'm off my suggestion ban, Ore Imo. I think you'll like it, Sumi.
otakon: i love gainax for gurren lagann
love/hate them for evangelion
Belive in the you that belives in me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6suX5z40dkg Sumica here for a full YT posting
ugh.. dead leaves is a weird movie
Sumica: look up
yeah but how the HELL did she get into space?
Sumica: So what wacky adventures are we going to do today?
and why was Shinji apparently in space when he was ... well you know he was IMPALED by a Spear of Longinus?
FINISH THE JOB
Sumica: you cant kill gods messenger!
get away from me
Officer
No problems here
otakon: mechs require space travel at some point
cause
Gurren lagann is awesome
wait thats not wat i wanted to say
I love how Sumica nonshelantly rammed that officer
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
WELP
Sumica: Clearly <_<
now where was i
oh yea
Gurren lagann is awesome
evangelion is fucking weird
FLCL is just...what
FLCL?
What?
Fooly Cooly
05,15Woohoo! All my IRC ping sounds have been changed to Persona 4 related clips. Tonight is a complete success
fluttercry: orly
O_O
/me slaps fluttercry around a bit with a large trout
05,15Now when people say my name, it goes "ACE DETECTIVE"
fluttercry: but as of now, persona 3 is better
Why buy a Vita?
05,15lies
what do all think with my first oc with the worlds longest mane http://i.imgur.com/te4us.png
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: so i can play alot of my playstation network games on the go
I swear, if I ever get this game, I'm modding out the WEAZEL NEWS.
13Sumica: hit complete scan first
13if you have mp3s or shortcuts to mp3s in there
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: but again, might be a GIFT to me so i wont complain if i get it
13ah there you go <3
Can you mod a nuke into this game?
hey KindOne
Does it also take flacs?
13yeah that's how i loaded mine in, better than rollercoaster tycoon 3 where you have to put the files in there
13it might take flac, details are in the readme i think
13Sumica: ikr, i was like "whoa awesome" when SA could do shortcuts too
Ohai fluttercry *hugs*
fluttercry: but why do you hate persona 3?
13oo is this a main quest mission or a side? haven't seen this before
I have a Steam folder on my external HDD now. So I'll be installing this game on the same drive as all of my music, then.
05,15I don't hate Persona 3. It was a lot of fun. But 4 was better
fluttercry: so why do you hate persona 3?
05,15Also, a "recent Places" icon has shown up on my desktop and I can't delete it.
13Sumica: did you do the playboy/that other guy mission yet? that's the last one i did
13the holland play or something
fluttercry: is it because you got your ass kicked in persona 3?
13oki :P
13well fun <3
whoa
fluttercry: i know i am currently getting my ass kicked in persona 3
05,15Bronysith what part of "I don't hate Persona 3, I thought it was fun" do you not get?
fluttercry: cause you fucking pulled a Kenye west XD
"yo persona 3 im happy for you and imma let you finish, but PErsona 4 is much better"
05,15tis the truth
fluttercry: dont spoil persona 3 for me
or i will do to you what 4kids did to one piece
I'm back~
wb thelonepony
Shizuka knows whats up
05,15also, Dwayne is way better than Playboy X in GTAIV
oHai texasboykc09 :)
/msg MemoServ READ NEW
damn
13yeah i kept dwayne alive, gta wiki says he gives you better options going forward
Bronysith: So..butcher it mercesiclly?
Bronysith, your chat is writing checks your body can't cash... but I still agree with your sentiment.
Bronysith: Yohoho, he took a bite outta of Gum Gum.
fluttercry: dwayne givs back up :3
13:P
05,15That he does. PlayboyX only gives you some money and I think maybe a jacket
Sumica: do you know how long it took them to make this game?
13midlife crisis is the only SA track i have loaded in
Sumica, are the Nanoha ED themes in the mix?
13radio x was the best
13say it with me, saaaaaaaage
05,15I hear GNR radio
05,15or is in JNR
05,15I can't remember
Vordox: who took a bite outta of gum gum?
fluttercry did you get rid of the "recent places" thing already ?
Vordox: where are they?
13the camera looks drunk
13wobbling a bit
05,15TheGreatAndPowerfulT yup
Camera go home
k
Nothing goes with vehicular carnage quite like "Make a Little Wish" and "Spritual Garden"
You're drunk
13OH i know why
....
fluttercry: so yea, spoil it for me and you know what happens
you guys... =P
13it's to make sure the image isn't static, to prevent burn in
05,15"What do you call 4 geniuses soloing at once?
13but the HUD would do that so...
05,15"Jazz"
Shizuka: Burn in?
thelonepony, it's a line from the terribad opening to the One Piece dub.
Kandarihu: 4kids dub, the funimation one isnt bad
^
13SpadeKyurem[WoW]: CRT tv/monitors and i think some plasmas have this issue where if you leave one image on the screen too long the pixels get stuck
Bronysith, so I hear.
05,15I liked the conservative talk radio show in GTA4. It made me laugh
Kandarihu: no seriously, the funimation one is really enjoyable with great voice actors
How they ask a kid to end world hunger one? i love that bit
13WCTR was better, I Say You Say was more fun than the hyperstereotypes they're using in PLR and WKTT
05,15I liked the hypersterotypes though. There was no moderation. Either everyone was a hippie, or a gun nut
05,15"Science is a four letter word in my home. The only time science is okay is when it's about turning a million ungrateful foreigners into glass"
i liked running over old people in gta4
Bronysith: Good on ya, getting rid of the old farts
13the little genius kid getting spanked on PLR is kind of funny but usually i have it on the user track station
131992 music was so much better :P
05,15Xbox doesn't have the user station.
13:<
05,15So I usually flipped between Lazlo, WKTT, and Liberty Rock
13and ogg lock
05,15It certainly wasn't as good as the old Laszlo, but it was better than some of the other stuff.
i hope GTA5 is going to be on PC
05,15Also, I'm super excited for GTA5. It seems that their going for the "Buddy crime action/comedy" feel
fluttercry: but GTA4 was good
hi everypony

Shizuka: hi
fluttercry: dont make me blend you
/me 13sticks a giant funnel in her ear
05,15Fun fact: I'm actually hard of hearing in my right ear due to a bad infection when I was a baby
yeah
fluttercry: how bad was it?
fluttercry: im hard of hearing cause of a vanhalen concert
sitting us right next to the speakers and forgetting my ear plugs
totally worth it
05,15texasboykc09 bad enough that I have to constantly ask people to repeat things
05,15Also, no game will ever have a better soundtrack than Fallout 3

05,15It's always weird in GTA games when they use british slang
WELP

Only british slang I know is Twat
05,15Grass

Only the Russians know the ways of the sunglasses.
Meanwhile hates everything

BOOM HEADSHOT

05,15RUN FORREST

YOINK

Niko my cousin, you must run!
Bronysith: He's hacking slashing and wackin!
So fucking catchy

COUSIN LETS GOBOWLING
05,15That's GTA for you
yes but it onl takes a second to use a cheat Shizu
13true
But Sumica doesnt cheat
13i've used the health/weapon cheat more times than i care to count
daaaamn
05,15I usually don't cheat until after I've beat the game
^
Is Shizu accompanying Sumica in the destruction of Liberty City tonight?
I never cheat on my girlfriends.
I THINK I CAN!
nnope
More Pillows
Wait wat?
13generally i cheat and play as though i don't
Fix the damn car
Different kind of cheat you say?
MOAR PILLOWS IS BEST!
Huh?
13so godmode but still take cover etc
Shizuka: for shame
What's more pillows?
AssaultWithEmbraces: <3
the music
05,15I wish GTA4 had the cheat to make the citizens riot
AssaultWithEmbraces: the song artist lol
13Sumica: no cloverleafs? phoenix was like that
Riot mode?
05,15SpadeKyurem[WoW] everyone started killing each other
13SA's story had los santos start rioting at one point
Shizuka: phoenix wright?
fluttercry: sounds like the best thing ever
13referencing the 1992 LA riots over a similar cop corruption case
That game was AMAZING in other words
13there was a cheat to force the riots on any time
Aw yeaah
05,15GTA3 had that mode too
What?
I dun remember that
05,15People would walk around with M60s and shoot everyone
Waaat?
I never seen that
Sumica: So you got a suit and a new car what are you gonna do now?!
05,15State of Emergency
how long is it takeing fo it to download?
*for
i want the vita so i can play persona 4
Who stole our car?
13Sumica: is it actively going? steam tends to stop downloads when you start a game up
ok, you?
13right :P
doing ok thanks
Where the fuck did our Pimping car go?
05,15HE STOLE A CAR! SHOOT HIM
13dat Air
13tori no uta remix?
god i love shadow of the colossus
Maybe this is just me, but Skype makes my games run like poo
such a perfect game
oooh, it is
13guess i should get air huh :P
it was pretty active today
10? for jo right?
hello everypony
ohai Zeus
Hi
you're not Zeus
13this is nice mix
Shizuka, do the shortcuts have to be for individual files? Or would a playlist suffice?
Sumica: Swingset shenanigans?
uh huh
13Kandarihu: has to be the individual files
Bronysith sh. Don't ruin it for him (he paid me good money to act like he is)
Shizuka, okay. I guess it'll work out.
13and then you could still copy the actual files in if the shortcuts don't work
05,15I think sunglasses are only in the Russian store
05,15same with hats
Why only the Russian store?
Ima listen to babs seed while you play.
13i've had a couple tracks just not play when the radio gets to them, i think it's because they're too long or maybe the filename/tags have something it doesn't like
we just need something to talk about haha
Its.. Kind of funny actually.
lol
Barbetos: I'm blasting City escape watching this
It fits amusingly
13dat nope
sorry, I havent been in the best of moods lately :(
Sorry for text wall. Pedestrians riot
While playing the game, press Down, Up, Left, Up, X, R1, R2, L2, L1. If you entered the code correctly, a message will appear. Note: Saving the game will make the effects of this code permanent.
Huh
05,15SpadeKyurem[WoW] LIVE AND LEARN
GTA 3
this in game radio is sadly better than the crap i hear on the way to class
it's ok, hope you feel better soon :)
Live and Learn is great but I dont think it goes with everything
It isnt Guile's theme
Zeus: he's running the custom playlist atm
13GTA4 really needed an interstate like SA
yes
13somewhere you could just open up the throttle and go all the way around the world
oooh, this the original version I hear?
Goldframe: ...still better
or is it from the movie?
13speaking of more anime to show maybe i'll show akira soon since no one votes for it
PHYSICS
13oh sumica collision detection is HARD :P
05,15TETSUOOOOOOOOOOO
PHYSICS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY
http://i.imgur.com/QphxY.png what do all think of my second oc?
Dethklok woooo <3
13even though every game engine implements rain as a cylinder around the camera which should easily be able to hull check for a skybox above it
Oh, COFFEE!
05,15Akira was actually one of the first anime things I ever saw
thanks
the first anime i ever saw was sailor moon
http://i.imgur.com/UX4Ikh.jpg Love this game so much.
13that offramp is horrible design
I think its just the stress :/ I still havent finished all my moving yet
fluttercry: wow what a way to start
my dads b-day is in a few days too, been thinking of that alot more
:(
I think my first one was Ronin Warriors
05,15Well dressed man walking into a dirty basement to buy guns. Seems legit
either that or the old DBZ ocean dubs
first one i saw was sailor moon but the first one i paid attention to was elfen lied
Code Geass was my first
05,15Shizuka's colors are gone O///O
Technically, the first anime I watched ws Go Lion. But I had no perception of it being foreign. The first anime I watched while being aware of it being anime was Sailor Moon. And that's when I fell in love with anime.
actually
hm
actually my first anime was speed racer
Shizuka is nekked
i always forget speed
05,15Cowboy Bebop was the first thing I saw. Then Akira. Then Princess Mononoke
code geass is a load of Meh
ja but my eyes are not liking my pink atm..
code geass>gurren lagan
05,15dat Full Metal Alchemist
L'arc, nice
death note couldve been the perfect anime, if it ended after L died
ah FMA
this the full version, Sumi?
Bronysith: lets agree that FMA is the best?
FMA: B was better though
Death note is just a breeding ground for yaoi fangirls
05,15FMA was great. I haven't seen Brotherhood yet
it was far from perfect before l died
Zeus: huh? fuck no, it is great, but not the best
I saw Conqueror of Shamballa
first anime i saw was shaman king though
oh i haven't seen that either
05,15Nope. I've been busy with Evangelion and Black Lagoon
Brotherhood is just FMA's version of Hellsing Ultimate
i watched FMA but felt it ran waaaaaaay too long
fluttercry: brotherhood is better imo
Brotherhood is like a side-story to the original
BROTHERHOD IS BEST!
52 eps is just too long for a single arc
Shizuka: Brotherhood is 65 eps but it's GOOD well paced
Evangelion and Gurren lagann are my fav animes though, short and sweet and utterly awesome
gah
It sorta goes more in-depth into everything that happened imo
except evangelion, just pure ass
fluttercry, Brotherhood is the source material handled properly
Shizuka: c'mon GIVE IT A CHANCE!
Kandarihu: thank you
Ive just been trying to keep my mind on other things
Dat rubber burning
do you have the movies too Sumica ?
ive never even seen FMA
05,15As long as Brotherhood doesn't get like Bleach where EVERYTHING is filler and boring. I'm okay with it
and The Sacred Star of Milos ?
Pretty loud stereo system in that car
fluttercry: brotherhood follows the manga more than the original
twilight_sprinkle: it is fucked up
Brotherhood follows the manga more as opposed to the first fma series
Da shoes
Its probably the shoes
Bronysith: more than eva?
05,15It might be the glasses or shoes
i forgot what anime i first watched...was it sailor moon? hmmm
twilight_sprinkle: i mean, not as fucked up as evangelion,
and then the clothing store was across the street
fluttercry, FMA = DBZ. FMA:B = DBKai
niko is haruhi
That parking
Oh how nice of dem
No you let him live
You killed da black guy
twilight_sprinkle: 8 year old kid lost his body due to trying to transmute their mother back to life, he lost his entire body, his brother lost an arm and a leg
I saw IT ALL
no you shot the bouncer lol
Kandarihu: that sounds terrible to me....
05,15I wore the Obsidian suit with black loafers
Shizuka: if niko was haruhi then the world would have ended awhile ago
The glasses!
twilight_sprinkle: the brother with his body transmuted his brothers soul into a suit of armor and now they try and find a philosophers stone to try and get enough power to get their bodies back
Wow
bye everypony
Nice parking.
back from filling my swiss account
sees ya texasboykc09
Bronysith: hm, well at least he has armor
05,15lol
BONK
I meant to say that the first anime went off in some strange direction halfway through, that just doesn't live up to the original. FMA Brotherhood is a straight adaptation of the original
twilight_sprinkle: he has no body, he cant eat or sleep or anything
you gonna sit through the whole interview like a champ?
Thats how I take off my glasses too
Before O go to bed
I cant sleep ;_;
You left us
D=
Bronysith: how is he not dead then?
Megic
thelonepony: why?
05,15It's the glasses. You can wear any suit and shoe combo but no glasses
twilight_sprinkle: cause his real body is held in the place between worlds waiting for his soul to come back and they can rejoin
NocturnalBlade: becuase of this place of course :P
05,15The suit is fine
thelonepony: well if youre not tired then its ok. if you are, just relaxing in bed is good too
why can't you just TAKE THE GLASSES OFF AND PUT THEM IN YOUR POCKET
The game can't handle your classiness level
You probably have to go back to a hideout and get rid of them
what Shizuka said
Ohai everypony. Damn Niko, you're looking snazzy.
twilight_sprinkle: edward used transmutation, sacrificing his arm, to seal his brothers soul into a suit of armor so he didnt lose him
/me is bein sneakeh
thelonepony: lol ^_^ i understand completly lol
05,15dat Shizu is a spah!
Shizuka: Where are your colors, why are you nekked
twilight_sprinkle: again, these kids were like 7 when they did this
ohai Petrified_Discord
Bronysith: hm well still, ive seen more messed up things
Shizu well its cause it is stuck to his model
Hi Petrified_Discord :)
Free ride
twilight_sprinkle: yea, evangelion XD
YELLOW CAR
05,15TAXIIII CAAAAAAAB
Blasting off again?
but seriously, fuck FMA
kill everyone in a bloody rage over suit?
kill everyone in a bloody rage WITH a suit
^
Daaayum, Niko
Drive from broker?
No thanks
lol
it's a nice suit
it's very well starched
More like you can't see without your glasses :I
gta 6 felma's revenge
and the Sumica was jhonny bravo
^
I can't see shit without my glasses if it's more than 5 inches away from me
>push guy
>get cops
lol I was about to say the same thing
!!!
lmao
Hooray for nearsightedness
05,15lol
05,15HE PUSHED SOMENE! KILL HIM
stop you violated the law, pay with your blood
lel
They only shot him LIGHTLY
so 1 pint or what?
Lel, indeed
how much blood you want?
you're in deep shizu now Sumica
1 pint 2 pints?
Sumica: does this bug you? does this bug you?
never should of shoved that dude now you got the national guard after you
05,15Obviously it's because you are a terrorist
that is did Sumica that is did :D
he is brown
oh oh i know this track
gah where do i know this track
oh duh
portal
05,15push a guy.....swat team shows up
lion king
How is the helo not keeping up?
05,15Is this Portal?
ooooo, so close
no its lion king
what would the world be like if everyone drove like this?
couldn't hear the lead synth cause volume is down
Yes fluttercry
fluttercry: what if i used this evoker?
05,15lol, I love how my ping is ACE DETECTIVE so now when I ask stupid questions, when I get answers, my ping makes fun of me!
i think this is the ending song of portal 2 minus the chorus part
Or get good exercise
If you don't have a car
Oh nice
05,15dat Final Fantasy 7
OH YES
Aw,,,,]
Lame
final fantasy 7 <3
what would niko's resume look like if he did it legit?
lmao
is tht portal 2?
STUPID COPS
that was 7? thought it was 8...
But he's in a suit!
Shizuka: FALSE
BAD DAY BAD DAY
05,15No that's 7
never did finish 8 the PC port was so rough around the edges
Fatties!
05,15It's the boss music
Final fantasy 7 is my fav final fantasy
tied with 6 of course
05,158 is terrible no matter where you play it Shizu
naturally
those who fight further i think is the name
i played through 7's port twice but probably wouldn't do it again without vm or maybe an emulator
jakie chan adventure reference for the win
now for approiate music!!!
that's a stunt jump but you need the whole road to clear it
So, whatchya talking abou?
FF7 is a great introductory into the final fantasy franchise
05,15this mix sounds like Manheim Steamroller lol
typical day on patrol for that guy
then ff6 is the best one in the series though
He was drunk and sent home mica
drunk on duty lol
it might be OCremix
and of course, chrono trigger kicks all of the final fantasies ass
i only played ff7: crisis core which was great
cause chrono trigger is perfect <3
yeah pretty sure it's OCRemix
05,15Chrono Trigger was fantastic
fluttercry: perfect
i like what OCRemix did with the doom OSTs
that's actuually the blackmages
fluttercry: i cosplayed as crono for dragoncon, funtimes
http://cheezburger.com/6880355840
memebase sucks
05,15I also really liked Legend of Mana
fluttercry: dont you mean secret of mana?
05,15No I mean Legend of Mana
fluttercry: seriously, for a moment i thought you were going to say legend of dragoon
Which GTA is this?
05,154
Thanks.
Secret of Evermore? AMIRITE!?
05,15A man who does not eat pork bun is never a true man
Final Fantasy movie is worst movie
No.
SpadeKyurem[WoW] which one. There are two.
fluttercry: have you played legend of dragoon? no? START PLAYING IT
YOU KNOW YOU WANT A HOT DOG
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: advent children?
the one that has nothing to do with Final fantasy
spirits within
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: oh, that hsit
Spirits with in has everything to do with it
bad movie but good for what it was
XD
AssaultWithEmbraces: no what?
Dat Portal song
no u
There was absolutly nothing Final Fantasy related in that piece of shit
Wait, can you install custom music or something?
05,15Is that metal Want You Gone?
suddenly want you gone rock version
Shizuka: what in the glorious name of dai gurren is that supposed to mean?
was that a rock version of Want you gone?
AssaultWithEmbraces: lel
I actually took a class tha was taught by one of the people who worked on Spirits Within
By bus
BUS

so lots of things conspiring against her coming back
-pretend theres a bomb and you can't go below...
Shizuka: keep telling yourself that...

Shoot the faggot

While wearing a t shirt
I've had the pleasure of witnessing Vivi's last 2 streams. And they are my most favorite streams

DAMN YOU RAILINGS!
every security guard needs to do some insanity workouts
So what was the point of the interview if you just killed him...?
Seriously why are all the guards fat
NO WITNESSES
05,15hitman
SpadeKyurem[WoW], too many donut places
some files needed to be grabbed as well
because we all know fat guards = great meat shields
05,15pony_4908 to take files on a corrupt police commisoner
05,15Also, the Bank Robbery mission in this game is one of the best missions of any GTA in my opinion
Rommulus: also, barbeque
Barbeque indeed.
STEALING A COP CAR GENIUS
All them people
wy is everyone running on da road
05,15Nobody will ever suspect
I'm gonna head off to bed, night
Because all cops drive like Niko
you didnt need it
You lost your brotershood.
YEEEHAW
Pfft
nice jump
Sumica: The losers of hoods
Is someone keeping track on the number of hoods lost?
So... you'll get shot by an officer for shoving someone, but not going on a vehicular rampage? :D
All the cops have to do is follow the trail of hoods.

05,15I wish you could steal the airplanes but yeah, very legitamate reasons for not being allowed to do that
:D
fluttercry: what reasons?
he was in the airport thats a violation of the law
fluttercry: terrorist training :)
05,15SpadeKyurem[WoW] think about it. Jets...New York
The hell is Niko driving?
I am just waiting for the day of GTA : Earth
true
there's only one aircraft
Or... there would be very obvious limitations on WHERE you'd be able to fly, right?
lets hope GTA5 is
GTA4 is a smaller world than SA
GTA:Sim City
this is GTA $4 ?
its also great for six star getaways
Hey, they're talking about you in the news!

They are talking about you
05,15I liked the comedy club in this game with Ricky Gervais and Katt Williams
05,15Especially Ricky Gervais
NOOSE is best SWAT

Why do we get 4 stars for just stealing this shit?
fluttercry: but in Ace Combat Assault Horizon nothing is done to prevent you from flying an F-22 into the White house.

SpadeKyurem[WoW]: just asked that lol
FUCK YOU POLICE
baracuda

05,15The DLC added Frankie Boyle to the club

Just Cause 2 has a massive world with plenty of room for long airplane flights... Except the individual locations aren't as detailed as this.
05,15and now we're playing SA
your car is basically a tank
radio x
dis song reminds me of gta sa~

Zeus: I thought it was twi
Doesn't sound red and black enough.
Alright, driving on the wrong side of the road is one thing, but running that redlight was just reckless. Be a considerate assassin.
00,02Chrysalis, that seems to be a common theme, techno musicians being nutjobs that is
Its the brony community, I doubt if there ISNT one
What is it with people making their OCs black and red?
there
twilight doesnt have the grit for assassination
Black and red show a distinct and dark past.
Phase4 his way of thanking me for being the tech for his show involved a rather drunken kiss
And it looks kool.
05,15Yup they have
he seemed more so than most
only russiacolts do
Looks like you got yourself in a... JAM!
Zeus: she will. trust me she will.

By Angry Ponies, are you talking about some version of that Angry Birds game?
05,150,1 undercover mods

I love beating that guy senseless.
Terrible
love this song
hmmmm
uh...
i don't
should i?
recoloured birds!

the anime is good too
thought i did
I've heard it before
this sounds familiar
fair enough
not paprika
Sumica: oh i remember seeing this intro, it was the one with the laughing people in the intro?
but it's different :O
SuperBrony64: http://derpy.me/yvQ1O
twilight_sprinkle: it is
this song sound familar
the song of a thousand loops
Goldframe: ah k

blood cot
blood clot, bamba clot, DO THEY SPEAK ENGLISH IN RASTA
okay that's a good look for niko
niko professional mediator
still not as good as biker CJ though
They do not
:D
its really wierd to see these guys arguing and somehow its all nico's job
lolol
05,15Little Jacob was the best character in this game
or can't use a jetpack like CJ
< dude where's my car
why would she want coke anyway, dr pepper is better
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
why cant elzabatha just get a new one out of the vending machine
The gremlins strike again.
or barqs
i alt tabbed away from my rocket
it went missing
best canned root beer ever
05,15Pepsi>Dr.Pepper>Coke
meh pepsi
^
mica llalalalalallalalalalallala
cream soda <3
I prefer Mug root beer to be honest.
never tried barqs tho
have you guys seen those coke freestyle machines
05,15You guys have no idea how much I love pepsi
with like ten thousand flavors on a touch screen
orphan tears...
coke raspberry is actually pretty good
05,15Shizuka are those the computer ones with like a million flavors?
wish it were a can
do you want to hear the story of angry ponies?
yeah
05,15Yeah we have those around here
05,15Raspberry Coke and Orange Coke is really good
orange coke? wut
coke raspberry reminds me of when mountain dew did that flavor contest long ago and had a raspberry flavor that didn't win
ive not seen those unfortunately.i would use my creativity to make a vanilla with vanilla soda
Niko drivers no survivors
No you've got it all wrong
cause vanilla ftw
Raspberry lime Dr. Pepper.
05,15We have one in the Five Guys and one in the Wendy's
cherry coke ftw
orange is a bit strong, coke lime was like coke+sprite and really meh
Vanilla Coke
mmmm
living w/ pinkie logic is better. you should try too
my preference is the correct one
vanilla coke is good, cherry-vanilla Dr Pepper is fantastic
05,15All the flavored cokes except for Lime were good
Vanilla makes everything better
Raspberry.
ice cream
coke
Lime.
05,15Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper tastes like original Dr.Pepper
Dr. Pepper
05,15this song....where have I heard it
but Cream Soda is good stuff too
dat white wedding
mica isent this song in the game?
also Dust
fluttercry: i think in sa
everytime i hear this song i mistake it for take on me
though after sports nothing tasted as great as orange fanta
i tend to get it mixed up with rebel yell until the lyrics kick in
05,15Orange Fanta is good, Grape, not so much
years of mom listening to the album in order throw me off :P
man, i dunno why but i cant stomach fanta anymore
grape drink is usually pretty eh
now crush
wish they'd bring pepsi blue back
05,15I can't drink too many fruit things though, they make me really REALLY sick
grape fanta is meh, but i do love grape juice
05,15especially juices
take care theres a gook around every corner
05,15If you give me orange juice or apple juice, you're asking for trouble
blue raspberry is the best flavor ever made
perfect amount of sweet and tang
^
blue raspberry is pretty good
my favorite fruit is pinapple, boy do i love me some pineapple~
strawberry is a close second for my favorite flavor
05,15Combine that with my penchant for getting motion sickness and you have a recipe for terrible roadtrips
but grape is right up there too
05,15Stupid Hotel breakfasts
only time i get motion sickness is reading in a car
chain link fence thats not bulletproof?
what is this magic
Good morning Bronystate! :$
good programing
how the hell do they know where you are?
hoi MadSurge
What was that a bullet the the heart? pfff like I care.
HE SHOT ME!
Snipings a good job mate
Good morning MadSurge
MadSurge: top o the morning to ya
HE'S OVER THERE!
05,15I get sick just 5 minutes into riding any moving vehicle. Planes, boats, cars, buses. I can't stand them
What about trains?
Buytoast: they're seeing the killcams duuh
05,15and trains. I rode a train to Bronycon and I felt like crap when I arrived
damn shame
cnt get sorrounding when your a coward!
love the tains
/me has been on a total of three plane trips, been on a boat twice, never been on a train
except when the beligerant drunk people get on
fluttercry: even bycicles? :D
and the crazy homeless people
05,15I never learned how to ride a bike, but I assume the same thing would happen
i do get motion sick in cars sometimes, but opening a window usually fixes that
biking is mostly about using the wheels as a gyroscope
only in ksp can you make a vehicle more unstable by making it weigh less
night vision scope would be nice
SURPRISE MUTHAFUCKA
niko doesn't have enough certs for one
Shoot the boats.
They know too much.
05,15I can usually take being in a car, because it doesn't take long to get where I need to go and I can stop. But buses...oh god. Just riding the bus to the store is enough to ruin me for the rest of the day
my pet!
to be honest, i'm scared of riding in a boat or plane
I love boats and planes :D
05,15Scary part about planes is taking off and landing
you capsize at sea your dead
you crash from the skies yer dead
Cant stand buses however
love takeoff, landing is a bit meh
05,15once you're in the air, everything is fine
i would be fine with public transportation but theres too many weirdos there
i can imagine how fluttercry will feel after a rollercoaster ride
takeoff is VROOOM and just when you think you can't go faster VROOOOOOM and then you're in the air
i like rollercoasters but only with shoulder harness
oh
05,15Landing is like "OH GOD WHAT WAS THAT NOISE I'M GOING TO DIE"
can't stand lap bar only ones
05,15Lap bars are scary
WEIRDOS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT EH?
You callin me out?
air is fun... when i don't feel like i'm going to fly out of the car
hey mica do you havce a webcam?
i would use public transportation but i'm miles away from everything... there's one bus line through this area and it only stops at like 5am
DAM IT
05,15I live a few minutes away from Busch Gardens, and the roller coasters are fun, but this one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo's_Chariot doesn't have shoulder harnesses. You have a lap square, not even a bar, that holds you in.
ONCE AGAIN I WAS FOILED BY MICa PLANS
time for NOOSE action
mica so they ported t6he gta 4pc to steam?
fluttercry: do you walk everywhere then? :D
05,15no I ride. I just take dramamine all the time
dat chopper
wow took you all night to complete da task
05,15This is all you have holding inside Apollo's Chariot http://www.qcministries.com/images/extreme/2009_busch_1_600.jpg
did he just say "you're dead fred" ?
please
Phase4 theres a meet up in mebloure on the 21st
wow wtf is with my grammar
fluttercry: your internal ear must be really sensible. Also that looks pretty unsafe
maby im still a bit tired
its alright im a professional Niko
some many dead people
its pretty amazing how this game manages to be both a fun more-or-less realistic shooter and a freeroamer, previous gta shooting always felt more like an arcade game of sorts
SuperBrony64 where are you?
05,15Now Alpengeist, that's a rollercoaster I can get behind
Hmmm, so I'm new to this whole thing so I honestly have no idea what to do...
goin truckin

08,01MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
/me looks up rite of spring
I don't know why, but I always aim to run over the hookers in these games.:D
hm this isnt so scary
ive heard creepier music
Ambrosia_Firehoof13: they drop tons of money, maybe?
dat portal music :D
Honestly I think it's just fun MadSurge.
lol
Ambrosia_Firehoof13: it's not like these games' civilians do anything to not make you want them dead :D
True.
Will they ever make a GTA with a woman as the protagonist?
Or a Rockstar game
I think that would be interesting.
That guy walks funny.
we should learn to speak like jacob and have rasta hours
lawl
I dont know why but playing City escape or Speed Highway is fitting somehow
its harder than japanese i bet
Japanese is actually pretty easy as I am finding out
Just a lot to remember
im terrible at memorization >.<
I lived in Japan for six months a few years back.
That is why mankind invented SRS
thats good to hear ive been mulling over taking a class
You can not learn Japanese without a good Spaced Repitition System
Ambrosia_Firehoof13: did you like it?
yup
Sumica: Why does everything look grey?
Trust
The grammar is pretty straight forward and almost no exceptions
Oh yeah. I loved it! I was there for Martial Arts training.
get off the phone your driving!
Fail!!!
WELP
:D
That trick was off the rails
The trains will deal with that
se what happens when you talk and drive
According to my SRS I already know 666 Radicals, Kanji or Vocabulary
Run Bi*** run!!!
thank goodness some other car was there to break your fall
Not much better though.
planning to play chicken with the train sumi
?
well if you were master chief you could just flip it
What are we driving on?
the edge
PHYSICS
WHY U NO WORK
GTA physics is best physics
Bethesda Physics is best physics

Dead hooka!!!
Oh nevermind...

I would totally do that car...

Who is streaming anyway? Shizuka?
and no shits were given that day
nope
Sumica then?
Yay! :D
footpaths are overrated
the road is lava
that took them a while
Talk about car hops.
liberty city: this is why you dont hire fat people as cops
they cant run
STOP OR I'LL WHEEZE
Who needs insurance.
swingset?
perfect soundtrack for destruction
What havent we done in a while?
Shizuka: is that a jimmy neutron ref?
no .-.
k lul
FLCL right?
yupp
oh god this?
Zeus, this is happening, deal with it
Run 'em over!!!
Phase4: yes boss
Physics....
What the heck just happened?
hmm im thinking the swingsets are worthy of godhood
master chief it
>where do you need assistance
>the swingset
>sigh... okay sir, but we're not responsible for property damage
this is odd
Run forest run!!!
wheres the truck?
is it illegal in the USA to walk around with a firearm in your hand?
hey look the mach 5
I mean, owning a gun is legal, right?
their there is five minutes or your money back
Yes, aim for the cops and hookas.
Alma: depends on the state, a few have concealed carry laws, i don't know any offhand that have open carry
the cop doesnt care XD
good park
"But do not worry, 3 of them are just for hunting."
probably a hunter ja
different guns for different ranges and game
"So, what about the other two..."
defense
food
Because everyone owning a gun protects civilians from each other and the government
Explosion!!!
Alma: it's a deterrent, better for it to be there when you need it than not there
Busted....
What is mica
baby dont sumi me
love the music
I am pretty sure it has more to do with the gun lobby doing a pretty good job of convincing everybody that guns are necessary
OMG
THE SWING SET
Alma: yes because only law abiding citizens commit crimes
Why is this guy so obsessed with this playground
cops having his coffee
to busy to enforce the law
*cop
cop needs to get out and play more
Why would you even have a fat policeman
And it still lives...
swingset was not amused with your antics
nice shot
this car can take a beating
HOW IS THIS STILL DRIVING
HOW
i like ur wrek
got a few dings she'll run fine
its a glitch
as long as the wheel can get some friction on the ground, it works
its funny cause the cops still cant catch you
I also never understood how the police in the USA can do car chases. Just let the helicopter chase him
'Tis but a scratch.
^
wtf mica
YOUR CAR
Alma: because a helicopter can't detain
In every other country it would be illegal for the Polica to endanger the public by having a car chase
Seriously half the car is missing
HOW THE FUCK IS IT DRIVABLE
police car can spin you out or corner you, a helicopter can't do that without severely endangering the pilot and anything in the vicinity of the helicopter
its a part of the swingset glitch
I don't think it's gonna get much farther...
Flip it!!!
Alma: id talk to a us cop bought dat sort of thing see what he says
FLEE
I actually do would like to hear their response
Run Forest!!!!
Nope
Lowrida!
In PayDay The Heist the police is putting the lives of the hostages more at risk than the robbers^^
i miss how SA did motorcycle hijacks
just kick the guy off the seat
ALL HIS PANTS ARE LOW RIDAS
niko's all polite, has them pull over, step off, then drives away
Alma: on the same level I would get your research from games nd movies
the vice city story game had a neat motocycle hijack where you jump and kick the driver with two feet and land in the seat
wouldn't*
Sumica: More swingset shenanigans?
oh sure enough, and then rebel yell X3
sumi wants to confuse me about which billy idol song is on
Zeus: lol, yes, I do believe this game is completely accurate
So why is this swingset so glitchy?
Alma: lol i mean wouldn't
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: you can see what it's doing when he collides, for some reason the swingset is a physics object
but part of it is pinned, and when you slam into it you're pushing it into the world
I'm guess someone in the coding department forgot to fix it
physics and collision engines want it out, which causes it to snap
it's all glitch
or for all we know it's intentional
will it still work without swings?
Shizuka: Yea programers love to do that shit
WOAH
i cant really imagine them not finding this
those are some neat seats
WELP
NICE SHOT
WEEEEE!!!
AND HE STICKS THE LANDING
do a barrel roll
nah, you aint seen nothin yet
gently does it
my guess is the swings are physics objects that are pinned to the world, but the frame isn't, it's just pinned to the swings maybe
50 bonus points!
/me gives Sumica 10 points
Phase4: well its for fun i would leave it if I were them
nooooow were talkin
but at such a height that it's on ground, maybe the swings were supposed to be destructible like light posts
Zeus, probably what happened
I want to see a future GTA. In New New York
^
FUND IT
but because the whole thing isn't pinned like the rest of the playground, it's a big tension glitch
the new feat in german engineering, the crapmobile
And you are playing Bender
How is this car driveing at all?
yeah dude
that and carmagedon
This object stopped being a car a long time ago
Sumica: inb4 giant ramps at the airports again
how in the hell is that still running?
they need a carmagedon cheat
Goldframe: lots of love
Goldframe: its a part of the swingset glitch
lol
unless they're building the physics engine from the ground up for 5, i'm sure wheel friction will still be a thing
whether they bounds check it for negative values or not is a different story
fear the zombie car
I would have bought Max payne 3 but then I found out about Social Club...
That patch sounds dreadful.
Cool guys dont look at explosions
they just turn around and walk away
Yay!!!
lol
cool guys dont have eardrums to ruin
i like how the swingsets idly make noise
They have cool guy errands to walk to
their meer presence is bugging out the physics engine
Did anyone else hear that random girly scream from the game?
niko's got a little captain in him
Ambrosia_Firehoof13, it happens
It's funny too.
new brand of beer captain niko
Run fatty.
I am excited for Watch Dogs
Hey yall
Sup?
hoi Moopy
you can see where the frame is pinned, right up in the middle A frame
hoi
That did't work as well as you wanted it to.
so i wonder if it works even better if you push the left or right leg out of line
Curb check!
Dang hes still not here? jeese
Is this the only swingset in the game>
?
there's five i think?
but this is the only one with good results
I wonder why
WOAH
or there was another one in the new jersey side but sumica hasn't unlocked that zone yet
nice
Nice.
that looked painful
And you live through the hell!
Best flight ever.
I wonder why this is the fucked up one
your blood will forever stain that wall be proud
wtf..
killed by swingset
WEEE!!!
well from what i've read, they're all glitchy, but this is the only one with good positioning and angles of attack to launch you a good distance
critical mission failure
i think you fell through the world
the others just punt you around the playground from what i hear
Hai guys
do they ever come?
Annoying secretary voice,,,
Alchemist: hey dude
Shizuka: where did your color go?
woot! Through the Night!
Outlaw Star?
outlaw star right?
yeah

Its almost 3 AM and I'm watching Sumica stream, what am I doing with my life...
this song was in that pmv
which i know little about
PFFF
SpadeKyurem[WoW], pony
there needs to be a mod that removes the jungle gym from the center
FAIL!
let you get a running start to the swings
SHIIIT
Shizuka, why stop there? remove the walls too
ITS GOOD
aproach the swingset from any angle
no-one really needs a spine
video game physics for the win.
Spongebob moment... My leg!

NIKO WUT R U DOIN
niko wat r u doing
niko

stahp startin mate
He runs funny.
Someone needs to mod the city to launch you at will
we need to get sumica the super heavy bus mod
mornin' everypony
Hey sumica you should do a jackass stunts in grand theft auto on that game
Just bump into anything and you fly
mornin SirGanjalf
why does it seem like he is floating a couple inches above ground when wlking?
*dances*
Niko is so dead
SirGanjalf: hey dude
no playground is safe o_o
Press "B" to do a barrel roll.
WEEEEE!!!!!
WHEEE
yeah, that playground is def not EU comfort :D
whoa
SHIT
Death to you.
/me yawns
kabewm
niko the grey, I am niko the white
its odd, hitting the swingsets hard seems to do less than hitting them gently
Blah, blah, blah.
somehow i am still awake 3 hours after i thought of bread
theres probbaly some specific position that causes the flinging
Shizuschlafen: Stop loafing around
Finally, fire truck
The fuck
Shizuschlafen: bread makes you sleepy?
IS GOING ON
hey they came
He may needs some buttering up.
woah, they're fast

the worst incident in munchkin history
....or had
uh what is that i hear in the far background there?
mica again\
last weekends episode was so average
the writer has apparently only seen lauren's notes and the first 2 episodes
i have my skull candy ear buds plugged in my computer speakers here
if she actually knew much about the show, she would have written RD as being nervous as phuck before she got that letter, instead of LEL SO CHILL I GOT THIS.
Well, it is officially 4:30 in the morning and I've gotta get open my restruaunt at 10am. Goodnight all!!!
XAX: didnt seem that out of character to me
^
Sumica, https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/ksp/Bugprobe.craft
XAX: it was the same person who wrote Mysterious mare do well, Dragon quest, Hearth's warming eve and Putting you hoof down.
why does it keep doing that :/
mica lazy
the door in front of my desk that leads outside is open, and there's a cold wind out.
but it's still hot.
;_;
Alchemist: Exactly.
XAX: I dont really have that many problems with those episodes.
ship
Sumica, launch, turn on sas and rcs, then press h
XAX: to each his own I can see where your coming from
yeah. opinions be opinions.
XAX: I actually liked Hearths warming eve and putting your hoof down.
k
Hearths was alright
moah engines XD
infact
also theres a debug menu where you can force this to work
the only episode written by MMW that i didnt like was mare do well.
i like canon history lessons so Hearth was a treat
XAX: but I agree that wonderbolts academy wasnt an outstanding ep.
Did Wrek finish the picture last night?
holy crap
this craft will go somewhere

i like the giant engines in the background XD
yeah
it has to be EXACTLY centered
you can use the keyboard shortcut for symetry
x and shift+x
two symetry then line them up
you placed a few more than 1 :P
that should make it interestingt
A solar flower? :D
not exact enough :P
it'll probably hit the bug either way
was fairly close
lol
yeah, something you've installed has stuffed its up
bugs gona be fixed in 0.18.2 so
that looks scary
Ooo
is it always fireing?
Thrusting during assembly... Isn't that dangerous? :P
they do look nice
looks like its suposed to be covered in some kind of shroud though
check the resources
lol
strange
XD
check if you've got any power
yeah, i think your sputnik probe is broken
this is how it behaves if theres no power, should spawn with 5 though
Hello Gold_Demona! :3

Vivix, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DOL55oVh1M :P
I'm really starting to love When The Clouds :3
spight: If I were on the PC, I would link you a google doc with links to all of the episodes in 1080p (except 3) with no hub watermarks.
But I'm not on the PC.
So bad luck. :c
:(
/me licks XAX
Well, feel free to link me any time you get on it.
iTunes and dvd of s1
This is my bouncer, so I'll be on all day.
though, s2 and s3? youtube-
Unless, of course, the host server goes down and my FRIEND doesn't make sure my server comes back up. ._.
Hmm, anyone know where I can buy season 1 on DVD? .-.
AdamTheDuck, ah it sounds good~~
Not at walmart apparently.
I just got mine, Amazon.com
I wanted to get it as a "gag/Iwantyoutowatchthis" gift for my cousin
Still Ustream

I wouldn't mind seeing that image with more of my time

Cheer up, maybe Derpy will cheer you up http://fav.me/d57b6ki

Why/how did you lose the laptop?
im in trouble
i hate people i hate people i hate people
Well.. :(
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cu7HxG6-88
is good song
You shouldn't hate people aniderp|bestcakeever
You should lick them instead
i cant lick people
aniderp|bestcakeever: Would you mind giving details instead of vagueness? >.>
You probably shouldn't lick people en masse, actually.
they will say im not a pet but im a wolf
You'll end up spreading disease between people. :(
well my mother got mad and took my laptop
then i took if for few mins yesterday to log off my things
and she said i stole it >.>
now i lost it for today/tonight
And now you're sneaking on? =/
i cant deal with the seperation...
It's not that bad if you can find something else to keep yourself occupied.
i guess she dont care if i cry :\
Gotta run. Bye :I
Bye Ponies47
how do i get on the pony irc on my ipod?
like this irc
aniderp|bestcakeever, download an IRC app, although I don't know of any decent ones
i tried to come on here using quakenet and it didnt work
I don't think iOS has any decent IRC apps. :(
Why did your mom get mad, aniderp|bestcakeever?
she blames me and my father
spight: colloquy is the one I'm using
its alright.
aniderp|bestcakeever: For.....?
then my fatger was odd last night and said he loved me
Blames you for what?
stressing her out
im more stressed than her :\
But what did you do?
Question, how old are you aniderp|bestcakeever?
Gold_Demona: I turned 16 2 days ago and what is this
I didn't know your name was aniderp XAX.
lol
20
XAX, you were born after The Lion King came out. :(
;_;
Jmo: .-. themoreyouknow.jpg
spight: You just blew my mind...
well she said i do trash and i sorta did but like my ipod was in my hand..
There are folks here younger tahn The Lion King... ._.
than*
Yeah.
^^;;
When did Lion King out? 93-94?
i didnt wanna drop it then my dad threw the bin in after me but it hit my ankle
there were folks in her who weren't alive a the same time Kurt Cobain was. :(
lion king mufasa ;_;
/me was, but don't remember Kurt
Why does everything look awesome/cuter with a hat? .-. http://fav.me/d5oe04w
heh
Because the top of every head looks dumb.
e
I like fluffy heads-
Fluffy hats
the top of my head is dumb?
but work wont let me wear hats ;_;
in the summer
how do i get my mother to cave in to letting me have it back?
better make sure to keep your hair long, then!
it is long
Hi guys
aniderp|bestcakeever: Be really nice and do stuff for her? I dunno.
i tried
she still mad ;_;
Without crying?
Hello _Dark_Moon_
but isnt crying a guilt thing?
Don't expect to just have the magic words or something to make her cave in.
/me facedesks
so what's going on?
aniderp|bestcakeever: guilt thing?
i tried please a million times
"If I cry will she feel guilty"
i did the cans and bottles ad made me feel funny
/me pushes a pillow on Jmo's desk
Jmo: that does'nt work on anyone i know e_e
have you tried calming down and figuring out why she's upset in the first place, then doing something to make up for it? '-'
^
You'd still be without for a while
i tried
i cleaned my room a bit >.>
I got a new mouse pad today. It smells nice.
You cleaned your own room?
aniderp|bestcakeever: what's the prob? i only arrived a sec ago :P
And you expect that to actually make her happier? :Dc
yes ;_;
>_>
You can't expect immediate results. Have you tried asking her what it'll take to get the laptop back?
well the bins are in the closet
since she wants them there >.>
why is my life hard? :\
Try cleaning elsewhere. She sounds like she's just stressed.
Agreed with spite :\
Try to do something that will let her take her mind off of something at least.
she says im lazy..
i work mon-friday
how is tha lazy?
Uhh I need to get some sleep /).(\
You don't do anything at home. Moms usually equate that to lazy. =/
Night everyone...
night Ducky
Niight adaam
I'm sure you need sleep.
AdamTheDuck: night
who needs sleep?
my father wouldnt let me take a walk yesterday :\
/me hugs aniderp|bestcakeever
I am out of the house alot so i don't bother my parents .. :\
I don't even live with my parents, so I don't deal with any of that. =/
its causde i was crying and wanted to take walk
Only other person I live with is my husband
I live with a roommate.
I play alot of football so im always nearly out
aniderp|bestcakeever: When you say you cry, is it crying "to make them feel guilty" or is it actual genuine crying?
i was actually crying
Cause guilt trip crying never ever ever ever works.
i wanted to leave the house yesterday while i was crying
he wouldnt let me :\
I got really drunk at Ren Fest and ran away from all of my friends while I was having a panic attack in the middle of the night.
Then my phone died... ._.
11,02Night all :)
SuperBrony64|Zzz: night
Night super
Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
Sleeping? it's like 1pm where i am
Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
Right in the middle of the UK, _Dark_Moon_ ?
_Dark_Moon_: It's 2:20am Tuesday here.
Im in Ireland.
CUM ON STEP IT UP
lol
I live in Texas, but I go by UTC in everyday life. :Dc
It's 1pm Monday here
do you think my parents care about me? :\
Yes
If they didn't, they would let you do whatever you wanted.
^
thats why my father didnt want me taking a walk?
There was probably more on his mind.
We don't know the whole story.
If you're crying and upset, it's not normally safe to go outside and take a walk.
My da does'nt let me go and play football in the rain e_e
You don't know what's going on on their side of the field, so all you're seeing is your own problem.
But i guess it's a good cause, i'd prob break my leg on the ground out there in the frost :P
Im a goalkeeper so i don't leave one half of the field :\
me upset and crying means i p[robly wouldnt come home until the night tbh :\
I'm talking about parents
then they would actually worry about me :\
Oh right.. i get confused
Gold_Demona: if it was my mom it would be one quarter my fault, three quarters her being pissed about something else :D
aniderp|bestcakeever: That's childish
i would be at the park..
Making someone worry on purpose is childish.
And it serves no purpose
well if they mad then i wanna leave them alone..
Then don't interact with them. Let them cool down for a while. Do some chores while you're at it.
If my parents are mad i leave them alone for a while and make it up to them somehow.
If my parents are mad... I just sit on the computer like I usually do.
Also, being outside while your crying and upset makes you an easy target for crime.
it would be?
inb4 why not use it instead of sitting on it
Lol xax..
well im depreseed if i dont have my eletronics..
or my laptop
aniderp|bestcakeever: That's something you're gonna have to fix.
how?
All i need is football, peeps and some sleep to make it the best day ever.
i need them though...
aniderp|bestcakeever: No. You need to get that "need" word out of that figure.
how? D:
they calm me down..
Find another outlet.
Practice moderation
^
It's really, really easy to get addicted to electronics.
moderation is going to work for a bunch of hours then coming home and being on laptop for rest of night
or is that not?
What you need is a wider range of activities.
handhelds?
im getting confused.. im just gonna sit back and hope something makes sense to me
Honestly, my kindle does wonders for getting away from the computer for a bit
aniderp|bestcakeever: Books. Crafts. Puzzles.
i dont get the freedom other people my age do :\
Nobody does when they're living with their parents.
^
so videogames is all i got
Try to take a break from them whenever you can.
Between games of League of Legends, I do a quick work out normally.
Or some chores.
Chores are a good way to kill time. Plus it's productive
Not only does it get my mind off of the game for a bit, but I come back and do better in game since my blood's pumping harder. '-'
I started taking swimming lessons again
I want to swim..
I'm just not confident enough to be without full clothing. ._.
I don't. It's too cold where I am right now.
I love swimming during winter.
/me sighs
Tiresome but it's the only sport I like to practice :D
i shoudl go ;_;
If only my apartments would keep the pool clean. :(
aniderp|bestcakeever: later :(
aniderp|bestcakeever: Well, good luck. =(
aniderp|bestcakeever, have a good day.
maybe i get it back tonight hoprfully..
or im gonna cry and sleep depressed when i get home
aniderp|bestcakeever: best of luck to you, bud.
/me hopes she will have a good day a work..
Well that session is finally over. Lovely.
08,01hmm
08,01i should really work

08,01spight: no such thing as too happy!
Nice
Practice happiness in moderation
08,01though, i came out of the other side of happy the other day
/me stifles an inappropriate comment.
08,01i was at a brony meet, and i think my brain just overloaded with happy, and i suffered crippling depression for most of the next day
Yeah
I have this weird curve of happiness with my life
After I go to a con, I'm happy for a few days.
Then I realize that I hate life because I can't be the same way irl than I am at cons.
Then enough time passes and I forget that I like cons.
08,01ah, post-con depression
Then I go to another
08,01it's odd, because my con is such a big part of my life, it often spills out into my real life
08,01in fact, most of my IRL friends at the moment are people who work for BUCK

05aaand home
ohai Wrek
05the question i asked
05what the name of that part of css is
05it was on the test :C
Hey Wrek!
05so i had to guess
05im probably not acing it now
05casue all otehr questiosn i could answer >_>
Awww :(
08,01Wrek: what answer did you put?
05tag
08,01i think it'd be more "attribute"? but srsly, i have no idea
05attribute is what you put afterwards
05say background-color:
05and the value is then #FF0000
05;
08,01isn't that a property?
05its been called attribute for the goign of the course so :|
08,01hm, fair enough
08,01this is an area of computing that doesn't interest me in the slightest
05i cant blame you
Are you asking what "background-color" would be in css?
08,01html/css is a horrible design methodology
05no im askign what the name of #example would be
Selector
05thank you
05in other words
05no ace
:(
I only know enough html/CSS to tweak a pre-existing skin to do what I want. =/
08,01Gold_Demona: same, pretty much
05i liek it cause it lets me do http://i.imgur.com/yS4F7.jpg
05horribru
I like it because I don't have to manually create the UI
Oppression, with two s
05dat typo
I've done that enough. html or other serialized UI formats ftw
08,01html/css needs to be replaced, but i'm not sure with what
back :\ what's going on?
08,01hell, HTTP is kinda horrible too
We're talkin' codey stuff
05what does the HT stand for again?`
08,01javascript should be replaced with a goddamn bytecode interpreter
Hyper Text
05right
It's almost like HTTP's horrible because it transfers HT :P
coolio.
05tp is trans protocol right?
05and ml markup language?
yeah
Back off of my JS :(
05i cant do java
It just... had a rough childhood
Ok?
05ive managed to implement it to anotehr site i made
Java's weeeeeird. >.>
08,01i do actually like some things in javascript
05but i cant code if from blank
hi
08,01people give it a hard time, but it has some pretty nifty features
08,01but i hate that it's what browsers force a programmer to use
Honestly, the biggest problem with the whole system is that there's no unified interpreter for any of it
05but this
05http://i.imgur.com/TXqPw.png
08,01a bytecode interpreter with access to the DOM, or whatever other primitive system, would mak emore sense in this day and age
05this i can do
05:D
08,01Wrek: HAVE MY BABIES
Problem is how difficult such a change would be to adopt
05thats only 33% zoom
Wrek, you beast. That's looking awesome
05its in A2 size 300PPI
08,01spight: aye, exactly
hello
hiyo
08,01i think at best, what HTML *should* have been is an intermediate language
Imagine just being able to use the local machines environment to run code./
08,01aye, exactly
05i kinda like CSS
05but i hate jumpign between html and css all the time
Just edit the stylesheets on the fly with Javascript~
05albeit since i began usign css my html has onyl been a set of divs
05nothing more
08,01though sanboxed native execution is trickier than just sayin g"here's a VM spec to generate to. i don't care what language you're coming from."
Yeah
Installation of browsers would need to become more demanding of environment
x.x
05but yeah still pissed that i didnt remember selector
Ok
05if i had
Time for work.
05id ace the test
See you guys
I'll send pictures of my rarity hoodie. :O
08,01and instead of a markup language and a styling language, have a data language (JSON!), and a template language
05speaking of test; writing code for hand is tedious >_>

08,01there, solved.

Hello Bronystate *coaths*
/me stabs Suzano for some entertainment
whoa... old game is old?
Hi :P
Suzano: It looks like Doom right?
to be honest havent seen doom 1 XD
XD
For some reason i cant' stop playing Timesplitters 2 lately :\
I'd say Doom 1 holds up today, it just has a charm that a lot of games don't have
Socks: first fps i suppose? and it's not overadvertised crap like Call of Duty
It wasn't the first FPS, I think wolfenstein was first, but that doesn't hold up and is genuinely quite dull, Doom just has a charm :)
yeah... same as Duke nukem 3d.... Duke Forever had balls of butter
Pffft, Wolfenstein 3D or gtfo.
Duke Forever.. development for like 15 years and it was still really bad :\
ot wasnt bad... it was TERRIBLE
Can't say I'm surprised, or disapointed, I mean Duke Forever went into production a year after I was born, I have zero attatchment to the series.
It was disgustingly terrible.
and i was getting sohyped
Suzano: ikr, i bought it thinking it's gonna be the shit and it turned out as one of the worst games i ever played
Dem loading screens right?
Don't even want to talk about the damn loading
The whole gameplay altogether felt like a sega genesis :\
Wait for price to go down and reviews to come in before buying a game!
Rule of life
the levels were linear as hell to
THe only one you need
My all time fav game : Sonic 2
/me can't stand sonic games ¬_¬
I realy enjoyed Abes oddysey and Abes Exodus for PS1 :D
Not sonic 2..
I never did like the new Sonic. he lost his old feel sort of.. now he's a douche
Put sonic in the hands of a good writer and he's a good character.
Socks: true that.
He's just never been in the hands of a good writer...
Instead he's in the hands of friggin' Sega writers who are people pulled off the street :\
Hello all, how are we this fine morning / afternoon / night?
I don't like platformers where you can't take your time and explore everything because the game expects you to run to pass some obstacles :|
05fuck
Nice going, wrek :)
bad luck Wrek, better luck next time.
MadSurge: Agreed
MadSurge: I don't mind that if it's only for like a couple of levels in the game
Hi Rommulus
Or if it's a Sonic game
Gold_Demona: well yeah, but not all the game
I have alot of old games i can get alot of money for
/me has no old console :(
how are you Socks?
The oldest system I still have is my SNES.
I left my Genesis at my mom's house when I moved out
If I could choose 1 old console to have I would choose n64, the games on that were aweseome!
And my old NES went to my cousins in Colombia years ago
I still have the original Metal Gear Solid 1 for PS1 with manual, case and both disks in perfect condition..
Rommulus: I iz gud :) How are you?
Gold_Demona: or at least, the game should be completely based on the idea of running and not make side rooms you have to stop to look at
I am pretty damn good actually, had a lovely nap and have been studying anatomy.
/me was born into the PS2 generation
Nappy naps :)
Now come on to see Wrek streaming ^.^
MadSurge: Like Sonic?
When was PS2 made again? 2001?
Gold_Demona: ever heard of Chelnov-Atomic Runner? *obscure games ahoy*
Nope
Never heard of it
Been up to anything today Socks
snake, snake, snaaaaaaakeeee
Not really, staving of the many hours until my inevitable death, is cool.
Gold_Demona: the whole game is like that, the protagonist always moves on his own, he can stop for about two seconds before the scrolling catches up to him and pushes him off to run again
MadSurge: Sonic was'nt a scroll screen platformer
Oh well, I guess we all kinda go into that mentality for a little while every once in a while.
_Dark_Moon_: I'm talking about another gam in fact
Oh which one?
:P
_Dark_Moon_: "Chelnov-Atomic Runner"
Now that you think about it.. if i sold all my old consoles and games i'd get atleast 300 something
Oh, never heard of it.
05this was the first game to incorporate dual weilding in the fps genre
Which game is Wrek playing?
_Dark_Moon_: doesn't surprise me
Oh crap.. steam validating my acc
Socks: Marathon
Why of crap Dark?
THanks :)
MadSurge: When was the game made?
/me hugs MadSurge
I only played Sonic and Shooter games at a young age
I use to play Spyro and Sonic games as a child. So fun.
Wrek: I think Shadow Warrior and Blood both had dual wielding
omg spyro the 1st part wasepic
Spyroo now i remember :D
but coulnt get one dragon free
wait
Crash Bandicoot 2
/me is away: nap time
_Dark_Moon_: the arcade version is from 1988, but the Genesis version is from 1992 and is more polished/coherent
05it also has the best weapon in fps history
I forgot about Crash Bandicoot
05the WST-EM combat shotgun
Same here.. i LOVED CB2
05a sawed off shotgun with a 1 hand reload
I still have Crash trilogy with team racing
052 barreled
However there was 1 game that topped everything for me and is still fun to this day
I have played it so many times over it isnt funny
The motorcycle level in Crash 3 .. omm
Digimon World 1
/me loved the crash bandicoot series
Who does'nt :)
Rommulus: I've only played Digimon World 3. What's the first one like?
<3 digimon
I got 100% complete in Sonic 2 :O
I mean
Digimon World 1 was amazing! it topped all games afterward. Especially World 2 which I was SEVERLY dissapointed in
Crash 2
I still think it is the best Digimon game to date.
hello internet people of the world
Hello pony_3940
The people of the internet world greet you.
I was really upset when they made Crash talk in the newer games :(
I might have to find the first game and try it out then. Cuz I really liked the third one.
THEY MADE HIM TALK!
thanks my new kind of friend who i'll never have any kind of personal friendship with
He should'nt talk.. he's crash for god sake D:
Making Crash talk is like making Gordon Freeman talk.
hello there pony_3940 :)
It just isnt right
05i think atleast 1 here will recognize the rocket laucnher
05no?
CF
XD
It looks familiar Wrek but doesnt ring any bells sadly.
Im just gonna call it Boss
nyeh?
To me it sorta looks like the Soldier from TF2 :\
05Halo Combat evolved
so who here really fancies megan fox?
derfurg
and that would be were I seen it before.
I never actually played any of the Megaman series, how was it?
Steam "validating" me to check im not a bot.. if i bought a load of games why df would i be a bot?
this game looks like a duke 3d/shadow warrior/redneck rampage clone.
Im not really into Megaman/earthworm jim really.. i never found those games fun
do you guys prefer games or girls?
girls. all the friggin' way
05this game is basicalyl halo's grandad
good lad do you like football as well?
Girls? What are they?
is that even a question?
Yeah mate im a keeper
Rommulus: the megaman games are great. i belive megaman x street fighter is out now for free.
Are they like... a new game?
Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
Is it bad I like Megaman but only completed 1/2 and 9/10?
what kind of level
?
Whaddaya mean?
Scoot-Scootaloo: All of my love
Are they like boys but wierder?
MadSurge: no, not at all.
And what the hell is Football?
scoot man turn the xbox off and get yourself a girl friend and dark as in the kind of team you play for?
Scoot-Scootaloo: They have a bit more in places and a bit less than others
Scoot-Scootaloo: :O:O:O:O
Football that is :P
How can u not know de footbaalzz?
Do you mean Handegg or Soccer?
Best sport in the world
Dual wielding shotguns like a boss.
Soccer/football
Because murrika
Is Wrek shooting or juggling shotguns? :D
Pony39
Murrika!
Scoot-Scootaloo: Trolling all the peoples :P
You play footie bud?
pony_3940: Are girls like Xboxes?
Scoot-Scootaloo: No but they do drag you away from the Xbox.
You remind me.. flex some of the guns on the pitch during the match :D
EWWW then I don't like them >:/
And ded

Hate when girls try to drag you from football

We already have a keeper
If he gets injured,
JRP2234|DooM: Halo, Combat Evolved

Wrek: It's impossible xD
HI Alchemist

My roommate threw some sodium chloride at me. Thats assault.

Alchemist, why'd they do that?
AssaultWithEmbraces: chemistry joke.
Alchemist: Aaaah I see what you did there!

AssaultWithEmbraces: i think this is Marathon
sodium chloride.. what does that do again?
That means I solve problems
_Dark_Moon_: nothing much besides making your food...saltier :D

oh yeah sodium chloride is salt :3
yup
I tend to forget these things
i don't have a good memory cause of a whack to the head or something like dat

the rest is overrated.
Im interested in football :L
Hey guys

_Dark_Moon_: and you play in the a league. thats good, no?
Yep. Two leagues below Premier which is the best you can be in
well then you are good at it. So dont mind if you dont know much about chemistry is what Im saying. :)
Hey~ you sexy things~
I actually have all honours in school too :)
All either from 70 - 90 in grades usually.. cept irish
i bought this game for a wrek a while back :3
it was in exchange for a very nice commisssion of sexy proportions
_Dark_Moon_: Im from Hungary and we have a completely different system for middle school (age 14-18), so I have no idea what the honors mean :D
Lyra`: oh my :3
Hello
bicyclerepairman <3
Honours is if you get a grade above 70
ohai Lyra` and Sparkle ^_^
:3
/me ahem
_Dark_Moon_: out of what? Our grades are 1 to5 with 1 the lowest score (below 50%) and 5 the highest (above 905)
dat Scoot-Scootaloo
*above 90%
Agh im sorry, we just have from 0 - 100% grades. No A,B,C,D,F etc
Any grade above 70 is a Honour see
Any below is a pass
But below 50 is fail

AssaultWithEmbraces: so uh, this is your modus operandi, right? http://i.imgur.com/wtMep.gif :D
i leave in 2 hours ;3
Wow, turns out im getting dragged into running errands with my father... ill bbl...
Hey
08,01Lyra`: you got an op?
on vacation yet?
nope. :(
you know i did :3
Guys who's on steam?
two more tests
:/
and I have to finish a project by 1 today
next week = vacation?
08,01Lyra`: be safe and don't get shot/blown up/etc.
After my test on tuesday
im just going to indiana
Wrek is, however he is afk atm _Dark_Moon_ so he put on some afk music for us.
which is pretty early in the morning, so I'll have most of that day free
oh yout real close then
08,01Lyra`: ah, okay
whats the worst that could happen, that i cant kill, seduce, or barter my way out of?
hi everyone :)
your*
yeah
08,01Lyra`: muslims.
I'm not happy about my grades though =/
hi Lil_B
MadSurge: YEp
I really just could not make myself care this semester
Lyra`: I was just in Indiana yesterday
salam alah melekum
08,01my god, that was actually horribly racist
Well its also because your professor was an ass right?
it was
thanks BladedWings :)
Im gonna go play some football
Later everyone
08,01i apologise to any muslims in here
your comment was bad and you should feel bad
that's definitely part of it :P
thsoe are the nutjobs ones
Later _Dark_Moon_!
most of my teachers annoyed me this semester
A job
especially the systems dev one
huh?
But I'm even having a hard time getting a job
i didnt get kicked for italics?
that was the last time I'll ever have him though
thast odd.
Are your grades passing?
08,01Lyra`: most clients don't support italics
really?
08,01AssaultWithEmbraces: why can't you get a job?
Yeah, they're not terrible
08,01indeed.
but not good either
i'll hire you AssaultWithEmbraces :3
any experience being a maid?
sans clothing.
:D
just lie.
always works
the worst I'll be getting is the low C in systems dev
Lyra`, no experience at all
say you worked on a farm
or something
you helped your parent growing up
08,01or become an escort
My dad worked at the paper mill
stay out of my teritory
Mom worked at a UPS Store
but jobs are so competitive nowadays, I'm worried they'll look at that as a sign that I don't work well in groups or something =/
08,01Jmo: why not?
That's just wrong.
08,01there's nothing wrong with being paid for sex
No nononononnononoooooooooo
:D
In your mind.
I like not having an STD
good girl
Will you be getting any kind of externship?
thast why you only offfer service to those who look clean
having one ruins all the fun of getting one
08,01well, some STDs have non outward sympotms
I had sort of an internship with this startup mobile app company
08,01which is why you never have unprotected sex with a client
besides i get tested once every 2 months
but due to some legal issues that didn't end up working out very well
legal?
That involved you?
I guess some of the employees decided to basically steal the company from the owner
???
I was not told anything about it
they fired you?
so one day I just stopped getting their messages
08,01Alchemist: i could probably tell you more about the business than you ever wanted to know
pretty much
08,01but not in here
._.
I still don't really get what happened
Thats just fucked up
08,01Lyra`: i have several
well, im clean, youre clean, and im infertile
I see that Wrek it Ralph is streaming
Ahhh, Alchemist Do you work in a GMP Laboratory?
c what I did there
emailed the owner a few months ago to try and find out why I was apparently fired and he told me all that
lets talk.
08,01i approve
AHEMMM
sonicdude558 awwww U
I don't exactly understand how employees can steal a company
Here's an idea, how about you move on from this shitty topic as children are around.
What are you floozies talking about now~?
I don't either ._.
08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: floozying for money
could ask SR about it
Jmo, shush
Lil_B: if you mean good manufacturing practice then no.
No.
that does sound like something he'd know about
Heya everyone :)
I am very tired
aaaaw but it was entertaining me Jaymoo~
and hungry
I can see...
My only guess was that the employees had more stock than the owner
You wanna talk about this shit, take it to PM or another channel, honestly.
08,01okay, i actually have to agree that we're getting a bit carried away here
Hiya MLP_Brovakiin
Ya think?
which gave them the power to do what they want with the company
Alchemist sry, I ment GLP :P But I did work in a "GMP"- Laboratory once :/
soooooooooo whats going on right now guise?
Wrek it Ralph isn't streaming anything
ah, that would make sense
he is streaming
yes
Hi everybody :(
i stand by my original assessment of: Jmo, shush
about to draw#
Lil_B: well then i do :)
I'm not sure if they had stock though; it was a really small, informal kind of company
08,01though, personally, i don't think it's a topic that should be off-limits for the ages we get in here
hi The_TCR_Engineer whats up?
Lyra`, go away before I start saying shit about you.
but is he streaming anything? No. He is streaming a image.
08,01Jmo and Lyra`, both of you cool it please
08,01enhance your collective calms
I am calm.
So how bout dem ponies
keep calm
this is their website http://sniffitapp.com/
I worked on the business section of that
and _____ on.
Lil_B: but I have to note that its only GLP on paper. If we did everything according to the rules we couldnt accomplish much.
Alright. BOTH OF YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP. Either talk about something instead of spamming the chat with your bullshitting
He is streaming music
I hear someone eating chips..
Alchemist good thing my school isn't... today I had to clean a lot of Glass-Stuff like Flasks for an Upcoming Analysis and When I was finished, the whole rooms had a slight HCl-Dust ...
WREK ARE YOU EATING CHIPS/
wb Wrek
Oi.
Oh hai dere
How do you take your tea Wrek?
okay the hell is going on in here?
I like tea with milk and sugar :3
otakon, best leave it alone
Lil_B: its a pain in the ass to be honest and it does more harm than good.
let the hate flow through you, Jmo
05earlt grey
05hot
There is no hate.
Wow they are still fucking at it...
08,01Lyra`... i asked you to stop
Alchemist yeah :/
ahh alright
kay :3
08,01<3
^-^
you forgot the tea at the beggining Wrek
05on stream
05you can see the 100% detail
https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6878364416/hAC80487C/
Goddammit world of warcraft why am I permanently banned and get refunded on my cash after buying the wow box and the addon ;.;
Lil_B: we already have to wear foot bags all the time, we should store the gas canisters in a separate room all the time if the canister is not in use, a non certified person couldnt even enter the lab without supervision etc. Its too bureucratic.
05how the hell do you manage to get banned on wow
05:|
I DONT KNOW! I have a email saying they cant upgrade my shit
Wrek it Ralph... It has a nice ring to it
so thye banned me permanetly
Say huh?
05sounds like a scam mail
Banned from who what now?
SCAM EMAIL?
There is a lot of that stuff going on now, scam emails
Was it WoW or D3 or soemthing?
08,01The_TCR_Engineer: they don't generally refund you when they ban you
This notice is being sent to inform you that we are unable to successfully process the recently requested electronic upgrade for World of Warcraft account (my email). As such, this account has been set to the account type which it was at before the electronic upgrade and no charges have been processed for this.

Not sure. I really don't trust "blizzard" emails anymore
Also the next thing is
In addition, in order to protect the security of both this World of Warcraft account and your payment method we have disabled access to this account to prevent potential abuse.
The last one I opened my account got hacked.

WINDOWS.
Spifore?
BEST OS.
Spifire?
SPITFIRE
Spitfire
JESUS
Alchemist There was one analysis which I had to do about once a week, and everyxtime I had to recalibrate the Scales (if that's the correctb word) every time with mini-weights stored in a little chest xD
lol what is wrong with you ThunderBlaze?
brb
otakon: Just woke up apparently
/me glomps otakon
Bye everyone
Later Engineer
GMOD TIME! HAHAHAHA
Lil_B: and the footbags are compulsory because the lab deals with biosensors and silicon wafers which are really sensitive to dust, but then why the hell do we have to pass an airlock to get into the lab?
oi oi otakon , whats up?
Sooo... who's OC is that?
im back to guild wars 2
Alchemist yeah, it IS rather Nuts
ThunderBlaze: That's Wrek's OC
He likes to paint and draw? neat?
Is that wrek doing the picture?
Yep.
Damn he's good
You should see his stuff
I wish i could draw like that XD
DX
If only Spitfire kept her voice her original one i would be in love but it was a major turnoff for me
The new voice they gave her
>turnoff
You should listen to the Swedish Spitfire...
XD
>pony
I actually like the Swedish Spitfire
I SEE A PIE!
05good
she must be expecting Soarin
05casue she's the oen who asked me draw this one ;)
^
wait
@Wrek: Wut?
THIS IS A COMMSSION FROM SWEDE SPITFIRE?!
05not a comission
05request
well still nice
oh
neato
Don't know if you should trim the wings though... Well it's your art so you do whatever I still like it either way Wrek
With a voice like that, how can you refuse?
So how long has Wrek been at it?
Since the episode aired pretty much
this pic alone?
yesterday
yeah
my god
about... 8 hours or so
he's VERY detail oriented
DX WORK DAMMIT
but we've seen him crank out good stuff in less than 3 hours
spleeesh
05the program cant handle all these pixels xD
Photoshop.exe is not working properly at the moment please try again.
Nope it can't
Would you like to report the error?
XD
SAI can't handle Wrek's skills
oh god
Huh.. I usually get a middle finger when I get computer problems
if only all of the brony artists coud do that
...
umm...
ThunderBlaze, but then it would get stale. Every artist has their own art style
Wait... did it crash?
Yep
/me was away for a few mins
05its tryign to process
Alchemist: first episode and it's an A+ right away! Impressive :$
oh ok
05im not touchign it right now
05its usign a gig of my ram
not even PS can handle spitfire and Wrek's skills :D
@Wrek: It's nest not to do that not to touch it at all.
dammit Wrek it's just too massive
Wrek, please don't crash your computer.
Yeah, I hope it didn't crash, destruction of hours of wroks because of a Crashing Programm is Probably the biggest "I don't wanna do this anymore" Faktor I have when making music :/
INFECTED MUSHROOM!
BUCK YES!
That would suck, all that lost work
Love your taste of music
If you would ask me I am an EDM Pony
That's all i listen too
You say Lady gaga I saw Daft Punk
You say Slipknot I say Bloody Beetroots
This is when I take a screwdriver out of the drawer and theatrically put it down on top of the PC case. that alone frightens my comp and starts working again properly.
Alchemist: XD!
I bet you guys that some r34 bronies have made this one scene...
I'm just saying
*Put's hooves up*
ThunderBlaze, not the place to discuss that.
agreed
AssaultWithEmbraces: Aren't we all adults here though?
oh, it works again :)
ThunderBlaze: my comp knows what its like to be getting "fixed" by me. It looks something like this: http://derpy.me/Rhpwp
08,01ThunderBlaze: technically, no
ThunderBlaze: you cant just assume that lol...and mentally, no :D
08,01our age limit is 14
ThunderBlaze not everyone. Plus this is mean't to be children friendly so theres other channels for such things

Scoots time
ok guys i must be off to class, goona be there all day so see yall later tonight ^_^
05Barbetos|PonyMan: listen to this song on stream for a quick while
Bye BladedWings :)
05it explaisn your condition
Somehow the Babs Seed song didn't stay in my head O_o
kay
Anyone like Ed Edd n Eddy
We do!
http://www.derpibooru.org/185409
You gotta see this!
MadSurge: It did not for me either, untill I started to listen to the Silva Hound remix
05atleast when the singing starts
Which is in the style of Trap aparently.
ThunderBlaze: I love john joseco's style :)
Trap = rap, hip hop, and some other genre I can't think of.
I know same
/me doesn't listen to remixes on his own
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: The Legend of Cadence: Crystal Heart
... trap?
Thats what it says
/me shrug
It sounds gross to me. The name of the genre.
But the song is still good.
I guess.
How are traps gross? O_o
I'm digging these lyrics~
08,01hmm
The Lyrics start and then I get customer
Sooo. I missed it.
MadSurge: maybe I think i know what kind of traps he meant...
08,01and then my exec profiler decided it was broken
oh nvm
never heard about trap as a musical genre...
but then again there are more musical genres than songs tbh.
dat paradoxical logic
Gold_Demona: i was sarcastic :D
I'd like to see the genre that has no music in it. :D
Gold_Demona silence music
Sarcasm? What's that? How do you prepare it?
05oo this is a nice song :D
How dpes it taste?
Gold_Demona: well its called ambient :D
Gold_Demona like... just an Album with a unwritten Disk in it...
Gold_Demona: do you eat it?
Looks like it is going to be one of those days. I start to think our internet went down, all the while this stream is running.
I am smurt it
or asn Album amde with LSD, so there will be no music, but you think there is mussic because you are hight Oo ... I stop now It has come low
ok, I'm off for now, see you later
08,01there are only two works of silent music i know of
And they sound different? O_o
08,01one is John Cage's 4'33, whihc is 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence
08,01the other is Mike Batt's Minute Silence
Songs like that make me wonder
08,01interesting fact, the estate of John Cage has sued Mike Batt over Minute Silence, claiming he violated copyright by making a derivative work
nintendo is what genisisent
Sounds about right.
modern art is confusing sometimes
08,01well, it's not all that confusing
08,01the whole point of 4'33 is that the ambient sound of where you are is the music
08,01so it is, in effect, aleatoric
Johnny Cage sued someone? :O
I always thought he was some kind of nut-puncher :/
o fuck
LOOK AT WHAT YOU PEOPLE
IM DISGUSTED
a angry birds movie
you people did*
JRP2234|DooM: to be honest, it doesnt even phase me :D
It wasn't me. D:
08,01Alchemist: is this an actual thing?
08,01JRP2234|DooM: is *this* an actual thing?
it was bound to happen

:D
lol last week before break
Its blocked for being "Dubious/Unsavory"
same
05aaah
05this is a good song
its the last week before the exam period for me.
hahahaa'
Lots of Dubious/Unsavory stuff on there
Gold_Demona: Yeah thats what I meant
I WANT PONY-SHIRTS DAMMIT
Depends on your definiton of "unsavory"
Em
soulrider95: In other words, NSFW :P
Meh.
oh god
not nsfw
05but dad also wanted one
not safe for woona?
You have awesome parents, Wrek. :D
LOL :D
xD
yes
Yes, that
08,01damnit, i meant a.
08,01it's an adjective!
I love how dumbasses always blame video games when people get shot up
/me 08,01gigles
08,01which is like a giggle, but spelled wrong
I wonder what an unsavory looks like
08,01Gold_Demona: a bit like a sweet, but bitterer
Oh did anyone see the new THQ bundle on amazon?
SI
05fun fact
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Nonono, this time they're blaming lax gun control laws.
Thanks to YOU
05the gal that sang this was on LSD during it
Oh he's getting the wings now sweet
... Damn they look soo soft
IWAT TO TOUCH THEM
dem feathers :>
Why can't I get a pony to snuggle :<
Gold_Demona: and the lack of God in schools.
This one chump on tv thinks we can get rid of mass homicide by not getting our kids to play violent video games or see violent movies
HAHA
sexual ed edd n eddy
Right....
I hear there was a lot of blame put on Bioware this time around.
For the shootings
I probably would go on a killing spree if I couldn't relax with my violent media....
What? Bioware? Seriously?
Yeah
How?
hahahahwhat?
Oh yeah, the older brother played Mass Effect, so logically it was biowares fault
Speaking of violence
there always is. Lobbyists are prey on easily scared parents.
THe guy who they thought did it had a like for Mass Effect on his facebook
those dipshits again?=
Anyone here gonan play TF@?
TF2?
"hurr durr, computer games make kikllers, derrrrp"
seriosuly, i thought that fad was ovee
052 of the largest school shootign in US history
anyone?
05occured 3 years before pong was ever invented
I wonder if they would ever blame pony.
Why do people think just because he played a damn game thats why he shot people up
Who ever they are.
05you cant blame video games
it's bc he was mentally unbalanced
not bc he played a video game
And just the other day I shared a facebook post that said "If video games really influenced people, then the majority of Facebook users would be farmers."
Getting ready for raving here...
Waiting for drop
When motion pictures were originally introduced, they had the same "they be bad" as video games have now....
I play that game, you don't see me freaking shooting up schools do you?
Pulls out Glowsticks
Gold_Demona: lurking?
I mean GOD I was in HS when Columbine went down
aniderp_work: Kinda
I made mention of it talking to a friend
I just finished college when that occured
I got pulled out of school for psych evaluation
can i have hugs?
I play plenty of violent video games
aniderp_work: yes
/me hugs aniderp_work
I don't feel like shooting people up
Lol I have to get a psych eval next week
/me hugs aniderp_work
idk if i can have my laptop tonight ;_;
HUG ALL OF THE PEOPLE
i'm pretty sure we all know that video games are the last thing that are even remotely to blame
/me hugs aniderp_work :3
Wrek what group is this?
/me huggles everyone
I've never had to go on a psych eval despite working with dangerous stuff most of the time...
Soccer moms just need a scapegoat to blame
@Wrek: What group is this?
fisting cows! yes
wat
mrcreepypasta reads about fisting cows
" he played counterstrike. therefore, counterstrike amde him murder people" by that logic we cant eat bread anymore. i'm sure the columbine shooters ate bread. bread makes killers
We must Destroy all of the bread
breathing makes you kill people
Breathing makes killers bro, everyone is killer
THINKING makes you kill people
or hey, they went bowling before the shooting, right? bowling makes killers too
i've heard they even wore clothes
I also love how they blame guns for killing people
Well im off to play Tf2 if anyone want's to join
OH FUCK!
Not the people who fired the guns
I WEAR CLOTHES!
Did you know that 100% of people who drink water die? It's true. >.>
yeah, its like saying that hitler and stalin had mustaches so beware of people with mustaches
i'm dangerous!!!!
GUNS ARE BUILT FOR KILLING DUMBASSES
OF COURSE THEY KILL PEOPLE
Al right later
Coworker trying to make sure his phone is working, recieving texts and what not. I send him pics of pony.
=D
You know what? The further we get away from filing Minority Reports on entire populations, the better.
To quote Larry the Cable Guy: "If we can blame guns for killing people, then I can blame misspelled words on my pencil."
actually, guns dont kill people
Gold_Demona, good quote
people kill people
i kill people
with guns
aw yeah
more accurately people with guns kill people :D
they just as may use a toaster to crack your skull. whatcha gonna say then? toasters kill people?
jon lajoie
toasters are dangerous shit Dark_Horst, dont joke like that
The only thing I'll agree with is that a gun's purpose is to kill people, but it is only a tool. Ultimately it's the person wielding it who decides how to use it.
i once battled a sandwich to the death
ducker almost got me
Goldframe: Alot of people fail to see that
*fucker
the brave little toaster?
We also hear about people stabbing people all the time, but we don't hear anyone demanding that we regular knives.
regulate even
Gold_Demona: thats because it takes effort for someone to kill 70 people with a meat cleaver than with a rifle6handgun.
True
Alchemist: you think killing peop,e with a gun takes no effort?
you obvipously never fired a gun
Dark_Horst: Spray and pray
It takes LESS effort than a cleaver
Depends on the gun.
Dark_Horst: no, no, I say its EASIER to kill more people in less time than with a shiv.
I've heard from people in the U.K. "We haven't had a gun incident like this for decades, because we banned all guns." Well I'd like to ask these Brits what homocidal maniacs use to kill innocent people.
can i be held?
oh i got a muffin today
Dark_Horst: Im sure handling a gun takes some skill and effort, but come on. a gun vs a knife?
This song again. =D
Gold_Demona: guess what muffin i got
aniderp_work: booberry? :>
yes!
boob?
:D
08,01Kandarihu: we use knives
08,01er
08,01they use knives.
derpy lovers her muffins
08,01or explosives
08,01or black market guns
mostly booberry :P
I like muffins. :>
08,01or legal guns, like hunting rifles
See? Bad guys use whatever they can get their hands on. They don't need guns if they want to kill a lot of innocent people.
I want a muffin irl now. :<
/me gives muffin
:D
i didnt eat it yet
im saving it for later
08,01guns don't kill people, bullets do
I dont know what is a booberry muffin but it sounds delicious :D
Yeah! Let's ban all bullets!
08,01i know because i saw a documentary on BBC 2
Also I ask how will not letting our kids play violent video games or see violent movies get rid of mass homicide?
watching Wrek construct the wing makes me wonder…. on a pony where does the hair stop and the feathers start is the wing all feathers or is it a mix?
you know what?
aniderp for president!
You could possible kill anyone with ANYTHING
free muffins for everyone!
BAN EVERYTHING
and sea ponies
Yey :D
Hell I bet you could beat someone to death with a Rubix Cube
Gold_Demona: dont forget your vice
In 2007, some lunatic attempted a massacre in Akihabara, Japan. He started his massacre with a big Semi truck. And when he could no longer kill people, he got out and drew a dagger. He stabbed as many people as he could with that.
Nobody's allowed to have anything ever again ever because everything's dangerous!
can i have derpy m\plushies?
okay lets make a list of ridiculous objects to kill a person with
banana
Alchemist: Rubix Cube
Kandarihu: a derp killer?
Alchemist: Banana peels
This is starting to sound like Black Ops 2 music...
um
oranges
WHY So many people are leaving the fandom?
What?
Dark92Enigma: they do? :D
good for them
forks are dangerous
/me just saw leaving the fandom 101
Dark92Enigma: Probably becuase of R34
that's why
So are spoons. They hurt more
oh
Dark92Enigma: oh god why?!
08,01r34?
the person next to me is watching ponies///
artist, I think he killed about 17 people in total. But we shouldn't be ranking people like that as more kills = better, though.
08,01r34 has always been there
08,01don't blame it on porn
^
r34 has been around forever and people are only NOW leaving the fandom? O_o
That's like blaming killing on guns
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Stubborn as Ponies
a 3 year reaction time is slow even by my standards
guys ;_;
Kandarihu: hmmm, i don't rank people that kill, i just say yay less population!
i gotta go :<
bye aniderp_work :<
aniderp_work: you have to work
i dont :D
bye aniderp_work! Hang in there!
ill try not to explode tonight
maybe i get it back tonight!
Gold_Demona: i blame it on people who create guns
ii doubt it ;_;
bye till tommorow maybe :<
MFW I put on a CD I haven't listened to in years and still know pretty much all the lyrics
My biggest concern about yolo is that so many people will ise it ironically, that it'll just creep into common parlance. Ohai guys :)
Hey everyone
Haio _Dark_Moon_
And haio Socks
So what's going on?
Dunno, I'm drawing :P
I only came back from gk training.. woah im wrecked
08,01mfw there's an Amanda Palmer song called Do You Swear To Tell The Truth, The Whole Truth, And Nothing But The Truth So Help Your Black Ass

YAY urgh finally finished comission, finally can get back to bronystate XD

Wrek: woah Wrek.. very impressive.
Kurra: link? :D
I can't wait to see this pic when it's finished. :>
/me is very jelly of Wrek's talent

Does anyone know how to tell if a finger is broken :\
Socks: same here.....
Same here

/me must hip his horns to Wrek's artology.... o.o7
I wish I could draw or paint or something, all I can do is write stuff :(
Dem eyes
Socks: I can't write :<
Hi Kurra!
I can write, but not very well. >.>
_Dark_Moon_: Oh colt, what'd you do now, let me see it....
Sad 'tings
I do art but wrek's drawing.. it makes mine look like stick figures..
Gold_Demona: :D
I can do 3d stuff, but not living things, so no ponies :<
Diving around and it won't move anymore :(
/me ' drawing is stickfigures
Don't feel bad _Dark_Moon_ , just keep at it and growing in arts....
what you mean diving around?
I can vaguely edit sprites... ish
Im a goalkeeper, so i dive around the 6 yard box to save shots, you see.

I landed on my finger
Oh oh, GOOD ON YA FOOTBALLER 8D!
And now it's all messed up..

UCD?

University College Dublin
DUDE :o
Dudee what :3
Gold_Demona: That's not football :[
Don't you have a team medic? Ask them no? Maybe you injured a nerve, which maybe is why you can't move it?
Socks: I agree, but it has no other name. :P
It happens all the time
It is at best hand prolate sphereoid

05onyl damage you can ever get is carpel tunnel
08,01carpal tunnel sucks
I always break my thumb back into place and put the glove back on and continue
:\
05compared to broken bones, damaged nerves adn overal damage?
08,01especially when it stops you doing something you love and makes you choose a career in computer science instead of blasting out cello metal on a stage
08,01i mean, um
08,01yeah
08,01fuck carpal tunnel
05cello metal...

At some point, i'll be a famous goalkeeper/player :3
Esports and sports are completely different things, so stop comparing them.
/me will buy the PS3 football game with _Dark_Moon_ innit X3
Footballers (even bad ones who never play) still get payed 15,000 a week o.O

05these 256 layer limits is annoying me
05feel like codign a drawing progream?
05xD
I still think the drawing is friggin amazing
05srsly though i hate this limit
Wrek: i suck at programs like that so im just going to pretend i know wat u takin about k :)
week, can you build things like the wing, outfit, ext in another project and then nest the project into this one? that would reduce the layer level greatly
week = wrek
how many layers ya got left Wrek ?
I think he's nearly out of them
PIE!
:D Wrek put in an Applepiiiiiieeeeee
i baked you a pie :D
oh boy what flavour :O
05i know that the_real_pony_1604, but i dotn want to merge thigns i might want to edit later
PIE FLAVOR:|
*guitar solo*
you should be able to open the project and still edit it. granted it might be a little strange feeling.
MAN.... i missed my x-mas part caus im sick
cause*
Wrek: Can't you save some layers as a separate project before you merge them in the main one? Later on, you can edit them in the new project and replace the old merged layer in the main one.
epplepaj
Äppelpaj
yes
dat detailed pie
all the way

I just finished building my computer, won't need upgrades for a while
Not even 256, 248 XD

:P
05my new builts usually got for around 1600
05but i have hardware for 2200 actively in use
dude
2000, I think is the perfect number
To get everything running smoothly
Drew: Mine runs amazing and wasnt 2k
05smoothly has nothing to do with it :P
:I
05sure you get good harware
05but it wont run more smoothly
Well, it has to be able to record well
the gtx 580 starts at 240. that's money
my 570 is tri-slot and cost 300 :3
the thing weighs a ton
05cheap and runs pretty much as well as an I7
I have a AMD FX-8120 overclocked to 4.3 Ghz
never gets above 115F too
oh god what did i start o.o
I'm too much of a noob to know about this...I'll just find a video on youtube about building a gaming computer XD
05feck
05im currently memory locked due to sai taking ages to save
I'll just buy a computer.
Prebuilts are horrible for the price you pay IMHO
05cant close any programs :C
Or i'll just USE the computer I has :p

Also, it's serenity, not very_silly_filly ^^

No kill like overkill soulrider95
05point is
Drew: You need around that to run a server

Brb going to microwave some food

Wrek: what's the frequency on your CPU?
64GB of ram
64???Why? You only need 12 for gaming, max, and 16 for anything else

You use ammo for currency?
Interesting

only the military grade ammo
Why does a kid want ammo anyway?
the cheap russian ammo is only for shooting >:D
YokusaHHart: So he can shoot shit
Why else do you need ammo?
they pulled that bait shit in skyrim too
2 Tables at the Table... only one is scripted for you to sit on... Hwy have the other one than there anyway?!
that's his payment?
one lousy smg mag=
IN THIS GAME, military grade ammo is used as currency
I'm guessing Ammo is currency?
Yes it is
ITS A TRAP
doestn seem to be much ammo in the future
*there
WAZZZUP
on the hardest difficulty ammo pickups give you like 1-3 bullets XD
ooh deus ex
oh wait no, metro?
Lil_B: not if you ask fallout^^
this game is awesome
shame the sequel might not see the light of day
Chrysalis: It will be, they are taking pre-orders
Dark_Horst well, Fallout seems te be build up again after "The Fallout" to have some Weapon and Bullet Manufactoys :P
only one i know of is pittsburg

WREKKY plz read chat :<
Minecraft :P
YokusaHHart: Sounds like a plan
ooh wreks playin with BigScreen
so Im going to have to destroy tons of stuff on my hard disk -.-
why
Kipkat07_Scarf: The FBI's not coming to your house are they?
i gtg everyone
cya
Bye Snow :)
Bye Snow
00,10remember use fire, tey can still recover some data if you ues magnets
cya Snow
/me has stopped falling in bronystate
because Im near positive I have a fuckin virus. I never got my antivirus updated
Dat livstid i krig :3
Sumica or just use a free-ware data removal tool
Can you system restore it to before you think you had a virus?
00,10takes too long
that way you keep the drive
Sugar_Flanks if you kept backups
Welcome back :3
00,10they can abbort the data wipe
heres a hint
I could use system restore but I dont want to have to reinstall Linux and all my steam games
dont keep crap like that on a pc
Kipkat07_Scarf: Gotcha
wanna destroy data? smash hdd with a sledgehammer, burn the rest, dump in river
and my mom would fucking kill me
Kipkat07_Scarf you dont need to
only way to be sure
steam is portable
Kipkat07_Scarf, so it's just a virus and not an FBI raid?
00,10oh I thought we were talking about a panic button
00,10not just simple virus removal
i have no idea what we're talking about
yo momma
i just read about magnets and thats the first thing i though of^^
Wrek, I was waiting for someone to start streaming Big Picture.
So thank you
Kandarihu its just an interface
Chrysalis, but it's a nice front-end.
I have done desperation HDD wipes before. I once destroyed my entire Windows account because my uncle was coming over and was going to stumble upon my pony folder
so?
00,10big picture would not show up on stream
Kandarihu: why were you waiting? it was in a steam update
everyone got it
front ends dont do anything
anyone else have a black screen?
Yeah....
I've heard a nice Story about somone who doenloaded Movies and just sold them for a few Bucks on DVD, and the day the Police came to his House, he Slipped a Slim Sheed of Metal out of his PC, which caused a small amount of higly concentrated Acid to ruin his HD enough to not proof his Guild xD
Kipkat07_Scarf: that i'd call paranoid
00,10hmmm, I see only darkness
Kipkat07_Scarf how bout oh i dont know
Dark_Horst: it was
a password
Wrek: it isnt capturing the game
or an encrypted folder
you know, something easy

00,10yeah if you have write to zero programs
I dont think wrek can see/hear us
00,10it works jsut fine
Lil_B you can get programs which overwrite it with random bits several times
clears all the magnetic memory
Kipkat07_Scarf: try something like TrueCrypt?
though its a bad idea usually
Chrysalis: I tried looking but I couldn t find free ones
generally recovery is only ever a good thing
if you have stuff you want hidden that badly
don't have it
Chrysalis yeah, there are a lot that can do it, I'd probably use CCleaner because I know that they don't have any hidden Spyware or other unneccesary Stuff in there
or store it remotely

There are already giant sewer wererats... I don't see how this could get too much worse.
Kipkat07_Scarf: make sure you're logged in with administrator rights
this game reminds me of fallout
Im on the only accont
*account
its already admin
DUN DUN DU NNNNNNNNN
its like the mix of fallout/fear/doom
noppüe
not fallout
you know
fallout would require it to be open world
radiation and stuff
mutants
i mean the style of the weapons reminds me of fallout
00,10pump action flash light
stalker had all that too
fear scared the living :P out of me the first time
and nothing to do with fallout
The gun is HAUNTED!!!!
hey folks
hi triple
what is this :>?
drugs
Metro 2033
metro 2033
oh
dark_horst claims the name is drugs lol
00,10fear was not that good a game for me. my sound channles were backwards
name of it? no it is drugs :3
/me BREATHING LOUDLY
00,10I never looked the right way when I heard sounds
Stallion_of_War: go and try breathe in a gas mask
its never turn the right way after hearing sounds
:>
those damn sever wolf thingies
roaring all the time
BRB
wait i meant to say
its never the right thing to turn the way you hear the creepy sounds
Solution: Use a gun; and if that doesn't work, use more gun
nope.avi
and if thats doesnt work ... run
what if run doesnt work either?
and if that doesnt work ... SPY SAPPIN MAH STUFF
here is your answer
more gun always works
but then
suddently
UBERCHARGE MOTHERFUCKER
only solution for ubered demo is running
that vuy laughs like me
*guy
I need to get new headsets :'( my left ear sound doesnt work
i'm really starting to liek the setting odf this
if onyl the sound mastering woudnt be so fucking horrible
revolver rifle?
thes epeople seem to really like revolvers
i think the shop guy is heavy from tf2
FER BAYBEYZ
every sentence ends with babies
is russian
has awesome guns
but he is not fat :<
heavy*
i dont want to be offensive :3
conversations have WAY too much range
well they are in a dark cramped tunnel
you hear folks who are like at the other end of the damn station
what do you expect....
soulrider95: irl you'd have to scream to be that audible
and they are russian, they talk loud :<
it was especially noticable at the first station
cramped or not, you dont hear people through three walls
im back :P
Lets not argue the realism of a game with mutants :3
I think it might be a bug, I don't remember it being like that in other playthroughsI've seen
careful? wat
but yeah this game is great :)
seems linear thoug so far
hope that changes
well its suppose to be linear
sorry to be mean but.... his AK sucks
whats this game called
jcelios: i never seen, played, even heard of this game :3
Metro 2033
its Metro 2033
thanks
its trying to tell a story, not create a sandbox
or not
it's got that distinct russian bleakness unique to classic russian literature
the game is based on a russian book of the same name
ah that makes sense!
lol
see? that's why linear elvel design sucks
:I
oh mai gawd this gaim is laik K.O.D and it suck
:l
Not every game can be open world :<
I don't think linear vs non-linear game design is as simple as one sucks and the other doesn't :I
This one is more about telling a story of human survival in a wasteland, and creating that atmostphere.
he problem is that this is extreemely linear
games CAN be linear if they give you certianf reedoms
its not THAT linear.....
like human revolutio
n
I've played much more linear games
AHHHHHHHHH
god im tired... ill be back, later
it didnt let him jumpo a gap that would have been in jumping range
Bye dashoftherainbow
that is a flaw in level design
wanted or not
yes, but if it was TOO free, then how would they tell the story?
possibily, that doens't only happen in linear design though
well
soulrider95: ask fallout. or skyrim. they manage
Dont get me started on bethesda games
soulrider95: or deus ex human revolution
Skryim is the most boring PoS game I've played in a while
invisible walls and unjumpable gaps etc. there a symtom of a broader problem in game design
"sandbox" like Far Cry 3 does not let you go to the second island until yo do all the missions
soulrider95: well, play the Morrowind or Oblivion then
Skyrim is just bland
soulrider95: pos?
oblivion has the same problem
piece of shit Dark_Horst
morrowind is horrible antiquated
Pony on Stream
http://i.imgur.com/i2J4Q.jpg
you people have obviously no idea about games
fallout is just a better overall series than elder scrolls
Wrek: you need to change your filter
but skyrim is still good
fallout is elder scrolls with guns
it's exactly the same. they even use the same engine
well considering fallout came before elder scrolls, you are wrong
they should add an option to this game as a DLC that would let you turn off the breathing noise
oh and the gamebryo engine that bethseda uses is just horrible
appearantly you have never touched falliut 3 or new vegas
WREK YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR MASK FILTER
Dark_Horst: im talking about the originals
Bronysith: we're not
dem QTEs
pretty hard to talk about the fallout series as a whole in terms of game design specifics considering the difference between the first and second vs the third etc.
Dark_Horst: well when you say fallout, you are referencing fallout 1
FO2 is best fallout
say fallout 3 or new veags
new vegas is far surperior to fallout 3
Bronysith: nope
because new vegas was written by obsidian
i love fallout 3 mostly because of Galaxy News Radio
Bronysith: it has different strengths
its bnot superior
it has better gameplay
The writing is better in new vegas
new vegas has better gameplay elements, fallout 3 managed to capture the athmosphere way better
yes
but i came to play a game
the story is better in NV but radio is WAY better in 3
not stare at a picture
that doesnt make it surerior by default
athmosphere is vital to every game
tetris?
not as important as the actual FUCKING GAMEPLAY
and ther i though we were talking about the last two centuries
11,02Sleepies tiem is over \:D/
3 and NV have bassicly the same gameplay
SuperBrony64: Yay :D
but 3 has THREEEE DAWWWGGGG
/me gives SuperBrony64 a cookie :3
thats why it wins
00,10Superlazy64
I'm serious, batman carries a sample of kyptonite around with him
/me noms on the cookie :3c
he's ALWAYS prepared
and would totally win
11,02I not lazy ;3;
what are you guys doing ? :)
Bronysith: then again the tiny gameplay improvements new vegas had werent by far enough to outweigh the half assed western setting they used for it
haha
watching other guys play Breathing Simulator 2012
arguing which superhero could beat which in a fight (aka which videogames are "Better" then each other)
nice :)
when i played vegas, i didnt quite feel like playing fallout. that's what 3 did way better
so is like STALKER
wasting ammo like a BAWS
STALKER is like this game but almost completely open world
5/6 bullets in the air
however the story isnt good
*isnt as good
you are so screwed lol
11,02I'm on hold with the Apple Store to see if they have Apple Pies in stock O3O
i didnt know radiation can gut you like that
water op
mmmmm I <3 Apple Pie
11,02...three calls ahead of me...people must like their apple pies as well...
11,02This is what happens when you give Applejack all your business

Kipkat07_Scarf: what did it say?

I personally prefer immersive games with a plot. Plot better than 'here are terrorists. Kill them.' I like fantasy, RPG, RTS, roguelikes, and more.

bye SuperBrony64 \:3/
lol
glitch?
Yeah, this is a tricky part.
impossibru!
Yep the game loops if you don't evert
haha lol
evert?
explain!?
http://www.weebly.com/uploads/6/8/1/6/6816583/4459036_orig.jpg this is...what
Change the level
so you can't change modes at will you have to find a place to do it?
how are those marked?
nah , break blocks till you have a clear path , go back and switch to 1 level happier where the bushes dont kill you
Gnight everypony :)
LunarSpectrum: when he changes the world graphics
00,10he needs to back track
Bronysith: BAD TOUCH!
goddamn metroid style backtracking
Night Michael :)
00,10clear blocks
Night Michael
Sumica, for the medium ending?
Sumica: actually now he can do it
rolf
goddamn i hate backtracking in gaming
Wut
dafuq
wat
hax
The game disagreed on what constituted the guy's head
this game cheats
least it isnt mario with lives..
HAAAAAAX! *flings monitor*
LunarSpectrum: infinite lives, yep
05NOOOOOOOOO
ahh ja
WREEEEEEEEEK
aw
derp
once he gets to that tunnel he has to go back and shift down
so what the hell is the deal with Big picture?
...
steam for consoles isnt it
00,10it's steam on you TV
Makes Steam look prettier I guess
Oh.
Bronysith, it's a nice spiffy frontend to make it all console-ish.
ypur*
nova should make a until i rage series on this game.
Wrek: NOW kill yourself
your**
salty365: dat grammar nazi fail
Make it back here without dying
ik ik

lol
00,10oh is that the trick?

wrek you have more patience than me
I would have rage quit by now
rage quitting is fun
Sumica: yep, because it loops
especially when you set your enemies on fire
it ok to rage quit (especially this game)
00,10I would have guessd clear the path then shift the mode
00,10ah in a way I was right
Sumica: now he can shift and still have blocks
so... now what?
what is this I am watching Wrek play?
He keeps going
And look! progress!
I am so confused..
Wrek, go left at Eversion level 4
the_real_pony_1604: Eversion
how many "modes" are there and what are the differences?
8 in total, and you'll have to play the game yourself i you REALLY want to know
LunarSpectrum: modes?
MadSurge: the differences in graphics
things get happier and happier
LunarSpectrum: some stuff gets solid or dangerous in different modes
God, my eyes.
Happyest mode , all plants are grown and block your path and you can walk on clouds , the darker it gets the more plants wither and enemys get first depressed , then monstrous
Even Pinkie Pie'd think this is too much
oh..ok..
ha
00,10gah this hurts my eyes
and when its at worst mode, the plants kill?
SO PINK
Time for the true ending.
AND HAPPY END :$
yay
off the cliff
/me shields Sumica s eyes
happy ending?
super slow
HAPPY END
woah

lol?
is that windows xp? :D
mybe even 98 :P
Brb, gonna do something <_<
Phase4 awsome comic
GOTY
Gotta love Half life
course
and the portal series
Fallout with 1 intelligence 10 strenght
XD
7I don't know I'm really sleep-deprived recently that tends to make me a smidge more unhinged.
do portal
valve has done great things
In the original, if you have low intelligence, you could only grunt
Doom is awesome as well
7Or at the very least, stops me censoring my thoughts so much so a more full extent of how unhinged I really am is revealed to the world, in its rainbow-speckled glory.
never played the doom series
FALLOUT
they looked...kinda boring
7... Not that you would want it rainbow /speckled/
7I don't think I meant speckled.
They can get pretty intense
Killing floor is awesome
is dat windows XP
ZED gun is neat
http://i.imgur.com/g0vvD.gif
05its actualyl win7
7fuck yes
OMG original doom!, I have floppy disks of it!!
7This episode was amazing
05but having the basic theme makes everythign faster and stereaming easier
7(although Dash and Dust were clearly fucking the entire time)
ahhh
Very true!
I liked it, I dont know why so many people hated it.
interesting interpretation there
ha
People hated it?
I thought this was one of the fan favorites
I love this game...
well i saw a lot of negative comments towards it
a lot more than positie.
I also love how bronystate isn't blocked at my school :P
hm
confound these darn adds
I really liked it
7I ship all the ponies.
ha, the guy that did the blocking is a brony :P
got slightly annoyed at Rainbow Dash for not admitting to any of the wrongdoing herself and blaming it all on that other girl
7I mean Dash is clearly besotted with Twi, but that doesn't mean she's not going to take what was clearly an opportunity on a silver platter for some very athletic sex.
But it is a kids' show...
...they are transluscent?
wat
Who?
http://i.imgur.com/gFCOE.jpg
gotta love the classics
Hey everypony
I haven't seen someone play this well before O_O
and so, we are DOOMed to meet
Serenity that was bad
and you should feel bad
:D
Aww, be nice
:'(
Fluttershy is impossible to be hated when she cries
7... I think in my head I stopped thinking of them as ponies and simply started thinking of them as characters a long time ago, which makes it a lot easier to ship them without feeling weird.
05look ma! no strafing
Hey guys!
Look bastard, no miniguns! (In my terms, that's an extremely good feat)

Anyway, nighty night. everypony

7welcome to the internet?
00,10cause yeah CJ is scarry looken
and 30% of the pictures are censored due to "questionable" material.
alexxm|colt: the two that come to mind are the ghost car and flying to liberty city, both are kinda true, thought the liberty city area is above the hight limit on planes and its a small area
05yay
05took me long enough :|
Yaaaaay!
what wad is this wrek?
05first of the master levels
7... I'm sorry but 30% is a pretty good percentage.
ohhhhhhhh
05on ultraviolence
7 60% would be closer to average
05no strafe~
Par os 30s :o
7 85% would be something of a bad batch
I guess you have great masterdoom at this game then.
wow, what websites are you looking at for ponies? o.o
aaawwww
I wanna make that now
would totally buy.
make one for me plz :P
jcelios: that i know of wads can't change the par times
well first I have to learn how to crochet :P
I don't know where id put it. but id find a place.
05thye cant
Hmmm… seems like a lot of work
lol
they can change the level title and graphics with some haxing, but not the par time, that's hardcoded
I still want to make those plushes
7I'm off for the night, fillies and colts.

Dark_Horst reversing gravity hower
easyt
that would've just fired them into space
easy*
but yeah
spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
thsoe are wonky arcane mechanics
no but if you can reverse gravity
why not just nullify it
or, reverse it slightly
redirecting a force is easier than removing it?
because of the runic dismorphism in the untethered void
then point it into a cloud

Canadian_Brony: same
I'm getting bitched at for "being on the computer too long" even though it's been 7 hours since I've been on the computer
seriously, computer =/= xbox
i used to have that problem too
atleast you have a computer
not being on a computer is overrated
but then my guild sent me a new computer as a gift
She bitched at me before bc I didn't have a job on how I spent my free time
00,10so is gorden still a 4foot by 3foot cube of hitbox?

Ruby on rails is awesome
No it is not :(
I hate it so much
Lol
Such a perfect Kleiner
I guess I don't need to worry about college stuff until next year
But applying sucks
Science jokes...
Especially when your parents constantly ask you 3 times a day if you've been accepted yet
I don't know what it is, but RoR just never clicked with me
always some kind of unsolvable error
Ugh, yeah, I remember going through that
I had that and "how many jobs did you apply for today?" like at least once a day
I'm back~
Lol

it would be awesome.
Okay

I considered your idea of putting ponies on his desk
Now I need to get Pianobar to work
and I stuck them onto some computer screens here
Dont do it gordon >_>

Kandarihu: I will do as soon as I get a good computer

"It's your fault, Gordon:|"
BREATH
Is paper microwave proof?
well once again gordon has ruined everything for everyone
of course not :P
Or does it burn up or melt or something?
give him da kiss of life
it wont burn.
this is why we cant have nice things, gordon
breath!:'(
Socks: well, these guys well point out stuff and say it in the chat so you're not safe :P
Oh yeah. He dosen't need all that blood that's splattering the ground or anything.
So could you put a picture inside a microwave and have it last a while?
dammit gordon, i told you not to press that button!
A little CPR and he'll be able to just walk it off.
yes
I thought paper plates couldn't be used in the microwave :o
I use paper plates inside the microwave all the time
that's what I've always heard but I dunno
omg is gordon really dueling G-man with a crowbar battle?
and now he's just throwing stuff around
Same
are you saying you went your whole life without using paper plates inside a microwave?
Wow
XD
I guess so
Okay
you have not lived.
as if he wasn't already?
Take some chinese food
Put a ton of the rice and chicken on a paper plate
You'd better not be screwing with me
Gordon!:$
Microwave it
Holy Schrodinger's cat, Kleiner!
I'm going to be so mad if my microwave burns because of you guys :P
Pizza Pocket onto paper plate, consume said pizza pocket, throw away plate, no dishes to clean.

Oh, Gordon. First caserole, now headcrab...

Second image: has chinese food in the picture... But last I checked ponies were not wizards
Or maybe they are

Wrench? That's Oposing Force!

how hard are zombines to kill
Zombines are from science and outer space and they hate humen beans.
poor guy
harder then regular head crab zombies
welp
he's dead
oh dea
If only Gordon Freeman had that Gravity Gun at the time of the Black Mesa incident.
he's gone to live underneath aperture science
DA CROWBAR
Gordon is now 20% cooler!
TLS HANDSHAKE FAILED MOFO
Gordon is now unkillable.
?
!!
That's what Pianobar keeps telling me
great, now maybe he can actually do something for once
nope
What a polite program
Gordon makes chuck norris look like a coward
yet he still just watches people die without helping
Seziure>_>

Gro Godon!
I mean: Go Gordon!

I saw The Hobbit last night.
im just sitting here laughing
He helps, by killing them before the zombies do
I realized that Radagast the Brown = Fluttershy
a serviver
how was it DocSane
DocSane :O
...That's kind of helping... Right?
You want to do a TLS handshake? Well oka- BEEP BEEP ERROR
DocSane I never thought of that before.
Oh the irony killed him :)
ded
neva mind hes not a serviver
Hopefully....he heh...:$
It's pretty good, just don't expect a dead on retelling of the book.
creepy fact: the headcrab zombie sounds are actually reversed and distorted clips of people begging for help and crying in pain
i see your point
what is TLS?
i've heard that, it's pretty disturbing and pretty cool
"Gee Gordon, looks like your MIT studies really pay off"
:O
It's basically a security check that certain programs use
Pandora
DocSane and he has absolutely no social skills whatsoever.
Does anyone else wanna see Pinkie kicking ass with a crowbar fighting zombies?
sure
why not
In soviet russia.... ahh i got nothin :S
oh
I saw a gravitron diagram :)
translation: use the crowbar
Why am I so sad? XD
So, I noticed the SpyroChat login has a firefox and opera ad
Canadian_Brony: And he travels around in a sled drawn by giant bunny rabbits.
is Opera any good?
...wtf, is that snow?
Canadian_Brony: Fluttershy does that, right?
Opera is great on mobile
yeah, it's giving him hypothermia
DocSane . . . umm, no . . .
I've used it a little bit
Seems alright
You are one crazy freaking horse charger...*snicker*snicker*:$
snow so much snow
I don't care for it on desktop though
Canadian_Brony: Well, I bet she would if she could.
I prefer Firefox
Thanks Waffle :) Being normal is too boring anyway
"Danger Explosives... hmm, should i hit that with a crowbar?"
Firefox ftw

I mean, I know it's that Black Mesa thing. But is this live-stream
Is this Black Mesa?
he just... exploded!
?
yeah its a live stream
In case of alien invasion: break glass
Rommulus: yes
Shizu you playing through a second time?
I only get annoyed by it when it's yet another song about beer and/or trucks
Third actually
Oh.
oh it IS Shizuka playing the mod
yay
who else plays fps around here? =P
Me
:D
Shizu freeman that is who.
aka 99% of country music.
Who are you?
XD
Well shizu doesnt have a face >.>
Barbetos: I do.
anyways going home, will be back in an hour.
There was this recent country song I heard talking about this guy and a prius
I am ROFLPIZZA of course. The one and only.
beware crowbars
a prius? that's definitely different
You don't -really- play games till you stream on bronystate by my logic.
ill have to find the song
Its all been a lie this far.
God, I wish I could.
South Park reference.
my internet is terrible D:
I once saw a shiny new prius on my college campus with a "We are the 99%" sticker...
TACO TACO BURRITO BURRITO!!

No hard feelings
Is this black mesa, or is this a fantasy? Caught in a vent shaft, no escape from alien zombies.
Prepare for ASSIMILATION

You are excused

Anyone want some McD Fries?
ThunderBlaze: toss one here
fuckt hat
id rather have 5 guys fries
SnowdenTittles: Throws one though webcam
Kinda wish you could jump just a tad bit higher so that not every single solitary jump had to be a crouch
Gorden lets fucking everyone get murdered
Hey, it's the

Boom Headshot!
Snowden|Tittles: No prob
WHAT HAPPENED
lag?
Used one boolet? Reload whole clip!
Loading...
yah lag
oh
XD
Still have all the extra boolets
Boolet.
it is science
I just remembered that happens with Portal
I have only played a few games where you use a clip and it uses the whole thing if you reload early
I hate those. It's so... URGH
POWER AT MAXIMUUUUUUUUM
00,10now she can solve 800 problems a min
and more often then not it was a mod for quake 2 and it could not keep track like HL1 becuase of limitations from the engine.
Is wrek streaming this?
cya
Nope
Its shizuka
She plays the cool games.
XD
Did Gorden actually learn to use those guns or did he already know? I didn't realize combat training was necessary to become a physicist?
So does Wrek
i like 80s rock music
Hisin: There's a shooting range at Black Mesa
Hisin: not normally, but at Black Mesa...
...
Not bad...
SOUND THE ALARM
Hisin this game has a weak story as far as that short of thing goes. There are training courses aparently
Wrek plays cool games, draws cool stuff, and listens to cool music. Shizuka is an all-around badass in everything.
At Black Mesa, you get on the job combat training.
lol. what a bunch of hams
Dat run
I like all the streams =P
HEAD HUMPERS
Scoots are particularly fun though.
Probably to fight the abominations they create every tuesday
...
I would not say Half Life has a weak story :(
I am a Valve fan
personally
i dont get the hype of half life
I even have Dota 2 but i barely play it
Every Black Mesa employee is provided with a standard-issue crowbar.
Handle without care
ROFLPIZZA: XD
you rebel
Bronysith: did you play it around the time it came out?
so... whos on?
Anyway half like 3 is vapourware its never gonna come out, just like FIinal Fantasy versus 13
me
I'm still here
final fantasy is dead
life*
going to be making dinner soon probably
ROFLPIZZA no no no that is a VALVE employee
Barbetos: True
Hisin: Valve is probably waiting for next gen
No, Valve employees are given manditory knob implants in their heads.
well im off to play some games, cya :)
Valve is making childrens games now
True story
If they are waiting for the next gen it better be the best next gen game that ever will exist in the confines of space and time.
my leg!
Agh! My ovaries!
00,10I had alot of fun with those turrets and the train
My epidermis!
Guk! My duodenum!
/me protects Sumica from the turrets
One time in Borderlands 2... " I used to be a vault hunter like you but then i took a bullet to the knee" TRUE STORY!
00,10stuck the turrets all over the front of the train
Not a joke they actually did it
Yeah i got that to thunder
ThunderBlaze: yea, borderlands 2 is just one big meme
00,10and ust cruse the rails
In HL2, I ended up carrying four turrets around with me in the prison.
ThunderBlaze: it is one big breeding ground for internet memes
Ow, my liver! Ow, my lasagna!
Bronysith sooo.. in other words... a bunch of crap.
=D
Dat range
Barbetos: a bunch of overrated hyped up shit
Set them up at the end of the level with the turrets that were in the room already.
I thought that was a shotgun for a second there
It was absurd. The combine couldn't touch me.
I'm here
But then they did.
DUN DUN DUN
Meth check your skype
Anyone here collect Pony cards
Ponies? What's that?
Borderlands is the most addictive PS3 game ever I only stopped playing it because I started playing something more addictive: Minecraft.
Mincraft is addicting
Linecraft.
the NSFW community is much more enjoyable than the SFW part of the bronies
Who is ready for the end of the world this friday?
I gotta admit But i needs monies for that

RDR was frikkin awesome, i wish i hadn't broken mine
What about GoW
I bought Two copies of RDR
I loved the franchise before i went PC gaming
My brother lost his though.
Or it was stolen.
Or something
I dunno
too bad theres no pc version of it
or it was stolen... I dunno >_>
