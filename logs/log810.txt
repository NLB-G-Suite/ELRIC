hi
i have a feeling that my wings would be like a negative of dalmation print
lol
13in case you missed the earlier eps, it's strongly implied that the dream a haibane has in the cocoon is their last moments somewhere else
13so given that, three guesses how reki ended up here
13and the first two don't count
jumped from a plane?
it's called skydiving
whos streeming next??
its called tactical insertion
if reki is the main girl that is
hi
dont see how else she couldve ended up falling from that height other than a plane
13Kencolt: innit though :)
^
I may have to actually watch Haibane from the start
13stand alone complex being the exception because tech
it has a lot of feels too
GitS: SAC was a good series
excuse me while I die from happiness
and then THE PADDLIN'

Abenobashi is more WTF than FLCL
yeah, and abenobashi has full frontal underage nudity
at least with FLCL you can keep track of what's going on
the boy, full frontal at one point
but I like Abenobashi
Gurren lagann is probably my fav work of gainax
Gurren lagann is my fav anime, with NGE in a close second...i have no idea why NGE is in my top three though
eva has glorious mindbuckery which is why i enjoy it
after the bathhouse explodes or whatever. it is just a floor and some busted walls

either that or the old DBZ ocean dubs

i always forget speed
code geass>gurren lagan
L'arc, nice
05,15FMA was great. I haven't seen Brotherhood yet
I saw Conqueror of Shamballa
oh i haven't seen that either
Brotherhood is just FMA's version of Hellsing Ultimate
BROTHERHOD IS BEST!
52 eps is just too long for a single arc
gah
It sorta goes more in-depth into everything that happened imo
Ive just been trying to keep my mind on other things
Dat rubber burning
ive never even seen FMA
05,15As long as Brotherhood doesn't get like Bleach where EVERYTHING is filler and boring. I'm okay with it
and The Sacred Star of Milos ?
Brotherhood follows the manga more as opposed to the first fma series
Da shoes
Its probably the shoes
05,15It might be the glasses or shoes
and then the clothing store was across the street

05,15I get sick just 5 minutes into riding any moving vehicle. Planes, boats, cars, buses. I can't stand them
damn shame
except when the beligerant drunk people get on
and the crazy homeless people
05,15I never learned how to ride a bike, but I assume the same thing would happen
i do get motion sick in cars sometimes, but opening a window usually fixes that
biking is mostly about using the wheels as a gyroscope
only in ksp can you make a vehicle more unstable by making it weigh less
night vision scope would be nice
Shoot the boats.
They know too much.
my pet!
05,15Scary part about planes is taking off and landing
Cant stand buses however
05,15once you're in the air, everything is fine
i would be fine with public transportation but theres too many weirdos there
takeoff is VROOOM and just when you think you can't go faster VROOOOOOM and then you're in the air
i like rollercoasters but only with shoulder harness
oh
can't stand lap bar only ones
05,15Lap bars are scary
WEIRDOS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT EH?
You callin me out?
hey mica do you havce a webcam?
DAM IT
05,15I live a few minutes away from Busch Gardens, and the roller coasters are fun, but this one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo's_Chariot doesn't have shoulder harnesses. You have a lap square, not even a bar, that holds you in.

hey look the mach 5
I mean, owning a gun is legal, right?
Yes, aim for the cops and hookas.
Alma: depends on the state, a few have concealed carry laws, i don't know any offhand that have open carry
the cop doesnt care XD
good park
Once we had an american exchange student and he said he alone owned 5 guns in his family
"But do not worry, 3 of them are just for hunting."
defense
killing animals for sport...
food
Because everyone owning a gun protects civilians from each other and the government
Explosion!!!
Busted....
I am pretty sure it has more to do with the gun lobby doing a pretty good job of convincing everybody that guns are necessary
OMG
THE SWING SET
Alma: yes because only law abiding citizens commit crimes
cops having his coffee
*cop
cop needs to get out and play more
And it still lives...
nice shot
HOW IS THIS STILL DRIVING
HOW
as long as the wheel can get some friction on the ground, it works
^
wtf mica
Alma: because a helicopter can't detain
HOW THE FUCK IS IT DRIVABLE
I don't think it's gonna get much farther...
Flip it!!!
FLEE
I actually do would like to hear their response
Run Forest!!!!
Lowrida!
In PayDay The Heist the police is putting the lives of the hostages more at risk than the robbers^^
ALL HIS PANTS ARE LOW RIDAS
niko's all polite, has them pull over, step off, then drives away
wouldn't*
Alma: lol i mean wouldn't
but part of it is pinned, and when you slam into it you're pushing it into the world
I'm guess someone in the coding department forgot to fix it
physics and collision engines want it out, which causes it to snap
or for all we know it's intentional
WOAH
i cant really imagine them not finding this
those are some neat seats
WELP
NICE SHOT
WEEEEE!!!
AND HE STICKS THE LANDING
nah, you aint seen nothin yet
gently does it
my guess is the swings are physics objects that are pinned to the world, but the frame isn't, it's just pinned to the swings maybe
50 bonus points!
nooooow were talkin
but at such a height that it's on ground, maybe the swings were supposed to be destructible like light posts
^
FUND IT
And you are playing Bender
yeah dude
that and carmagedon
they need a carmagedon cheat
lol
whether they bounds check it for negative values or not is a different story
Cool guys dont look at explosions
they just turn around and walk away
lol
cool guys dont have eardrums to ruin
i like how the swingsets idly make noise
their meer presence is bugging out the physics engine
Run fatty.
I am excited for Watch Dogs
Hey yall
you can see where the frame is pinned, right up in the middle A frame
hoi
That did't work as well as you wanted it to.
Curb check!
Dang hes still not here? jeese
Is this the only swingset in the game>
?

Blah, blah, blah.

The fuck

then i took if for few mins yesterday to log off my things

now i lost it for today/tonight

It's not that bad if you can find something else to keep yourself occupied.
i guess she dont care if i cry :\
Gotta run. Bye :I
how do i get on the pony irc on my ipod?

its alright.
then my fatger was odd last night and said he loved me
stressing her out

it is long
Hi guys
i tried
she still mad ;_;
Without crying?
but isnt crying a guilt thing?
Don't expect to just have the magic words or something to make her cave in.
/me facedesks
i tried please a million times
/me pushes a pillow on Jmo's desk
have you tried calming down and figuring out why she's upset in the first place, then doing something to make up for it? '-'
^
You'd still be without for a while
i tried
i cleaned my room a bit >.>
yes ;_;
>_>
well the bins are in the closet
since she wants them there >.>
Agreed with spite :\
i work mon-friday
how is tha lazy?
Uhh I need to get some sleep /).(\
You don't do anything at home. Moms usually equate that to lazy. =/
Night everyone...
Niight adaam
I'm sure you need sleep.
my father wouldnt let me take a walk yesterday :\
its causde i was crying and wanted to take walk
Only other person I live with is my husband
I live with a roommate.
i was actually crying
Cause guilt trip crying never ever ever ever works.
i wanted to leave the house yesterday while i was crying
he wouldnt let me :\
Then my phone died... ._.
11,02Night all :)
CUM ON STEP IT UP
lol
It's 1pm Monday here
do you think my parents care about me? :\
Yes
If they didn't, they would let you do whatever you wanted.
^
thats why my father didnt want me taking a walk?
There was probably more on his mind.
We don't know the whole story.
If you're crying and upset, it's not normally safe to go outside and take a walk.
My da does'nt let me go and play football in the rain e_e
me upset and crying means i p[robly wouldnt come home until the night tbh :\
I'm talking about parents
then they would actually worry about me :\
i would be at the park..
Making someone worry on purpose is childish.
And it serves no purpose
well if they mad then i wanna leave them alone..
Then don't interact with them. Let them cool down for a while. Do some chores while you're at it.
If my parents are mad i leave them alone for a while and make it up to them somehow.
If my parents are mad... I just sit on the computer like I usually do.
it would be?
inb4 why not use it instead of sitting on it
or my laptop
how?
All i need is football, peeps and some sleep to make it the best day ever.
i need them though...
how? D:
Find another outlet.
Practice moderation
^
It's really, really easy to get addicted to electronics.
moderation is going to work for a bunch of hours then coming home and being on laptop for rest of night
or is that not?
handhelds?
Honestly, my kindle does wonders for getting away from the computer for a bit
i dont get the freedom other people my age do :\
^
Try to take a break from them whenever you can.
Or some chores.
Chores are a good way to kill time. Plus it's productive
I want to swim..
I'm just not confident enough to be without full clothing. ._.
I don't. It's too cold where I am right now.

Tiresome but it's the only sport I like to practice :D

08,01but you just can't butter everyone's toast
Yeah, some folks don't like butter. :D
05aaand home
05Saturn!
05what the name of that part of css is
05so i had to guess
05im probably not acing it now
05casue all otehr questiosn i could answer >_>
Awww :(
05tag
08,01i think it'd be more "attribute"? but srsly, i have no idea
05say background-color:
05and the value is then #FF0000
05;
08,01isn't that a property?
08,01hm, fair enough
08,01this is an area of computing that doesn't interest me in the slightest
05i cant blame you
08,01html/css is a horrible design methodology
Selector
05thank you
05in other words
:(
08,01Gold_Demona: same, pretty much
05i liek it cause it lets me do http://i.imgur.com/yS4F7.jpg
05even if as saturn said
05horribru
I like it because I don't have to manually create the UI
05dat typo
I've done that enough. html or other serialized UI formats ftw
back :\ what's going on?
08,01hell, HTTP is kinda horrible too
05what does the HT stand for again?`
08,01javascript should be replaced with a goddamn bytecode interpreter
Hyper Text
05right
coolio.
05tp is trans protocol right?
05and ml markup language?
yeah
Back off of my JS :(
05i cant do java
It just... had a rough childhood
Ok?
05ive managed to implement it to anotehr site i made
Java's weeeeeird. >.>
08,01i do actually like some things in javascript
hi
08,01people give it a hard time, but it has some pretty nifty features
Honestly, the biggest problem with the whole system is that there's no unified interpreter for any of it
05but this
05http://i.imgur.com/TXqPw.png
05this i can do
05:D
08,01Wrek: HAVE MY BABIES
Problem is how difficult such a change would be to adopt
05thats only 33% zoom
05its in A2 size 300PPI
08,01spight: aye, exactly
hello
hiyo
Imagine just being able to use the local machines environment to run code./
08,01aye, exactly
05i kinda like CSS
05but i hate jumpign between html and css all the time
Just edit the stylesheets on the fly with Javascript~
05albeit since i began usign css my html has onyl been a set of divs
05nothing more
Yeah
Installation of browsers would need to become more demanding of environment
x.x
05but yeah still pissed that i didnt remember selector
Ok
05if i had
Time for work.
See you guys
I'll send pictures of my rarity hoodie. :O
08,01and instead of a markup language and a styling language, have a data language (JSON!), and a template language
05by*
08,01there, solved.
08,01you can thank me in beer
You
Me
I get cold beer
You have warm beer
ten minutes
^
08,01haha
08,01<3
Oh yeah
:(
08,01got wrek'd :P
I thought JSON just carried data
HTML just carries data too honestly.
HTJSON
08,01anyhoos, i'm off to write a branch predictor simulator
Kk. /
hm
well, I like it how it is now
The system is fine.
The browsers have ruined everything, though.
I wouldn't know- I never did html before past few months
/me screeches
05i prefer mead really
All my interaction with JSON has been via faye-
05theres this awesoem tavern in stockholm Saturn that has awesoem mead
I only had mean once, didn't really think it was amazing
05homebrewed from one of the out of town viking villages
I don't either
I can drink it, but I don't really -- feel a need to

ooo .. it looks like Doom
<3 Doom
Hi :P
to be honest havent seen doom 1 XD
XD
For some reason i cant' stop playing Timesplitters 2 lately :\
I'd say Doom 1 holds up today, it just has a charm that a lot of games don't have
Socks: first fps i suppose? and it's not overadvertised crap like Call of Duty
It wasn't the first FPS, I think wolfenstein was first, but that doesn't hold up and is genuinely quite dull, Doom just has a charm :)
Pffft, Wolfenstein 3D or gtfo.
ot wasnt bad... it was TERRIBLE
It was disgustingly terrible.
and i was getting sohyped
Dem loading screens right?
Don't even want to talk about the damn loading
THe only one you need
I realy enjoyed Abes oddysey and Abes Exodus for PS1 :D
He's just never been in the hands of a good writer...
05fuck
I have alot of old games i can get alot of money for
/me has no old console :(
how are you Socks?
I have megadrive, SNES, NES and N64
The oldest system I still have is my SNES.
If I could choose 1 old console to have I would choose n64, the games on that were aweseome!
And my old NES went to my cousins in Colombia years ago
Nappy naps :)
When was PS2 made again? 2001?
Never heard of it
Been up to anything today Socks
snake, snake, snaaaaaaakeeee
Oh well, I guess we all kinda go into that mentality for a little while every once in a while.
Oh which one?
:P
Now that you think about it.. if i sold all my old consoles and games i'd get atleast 300 something
Oh, never heard of it.
Socks: Marathon
THanks :)
omg spyro the 1st part wasepic

Digimon World 1 was amazing! it topped all games afterward. Especially World 2 which I was SEVERLY dissapointed in
THEY MADE HIM TALK!

To me it sorta looks like the Soldier from TF2 :\
05Halo Combat evolved

08,01Lyra`: be safe and don't get shot/blown up/etc.
oh yout real close then
whats the worst that could happen, that i cant kill, seduce, or barter my way out of?
hi everyone :)
your*
yeah
08,01Lyra`: muslims.
I really just could not make myself care this semester
salam alah melekum
it was
Later everyone
08,01i apologise to any muslims in here
Saturn: ye bee loking for the word islamist
that's definitely part of it :P
thsoe are the nutjobs ones
most of my teachers annoyed me this semester
A job
especially the systems dev one
huh?
But I'm even having a hard time getting a job
i didnt get kicked for italics?
that was the last time I'll ever have him though
thast odd.
08,01Lyra`: most clients don't support italics
really?
08,01AssaultWithEmbraces: why can't you get a job?
Yeah, they're not terrible
08,01indeed.
but not good either
any experience being a maid?
sans clothing.
:D
Saturn: Trying to get my first job and I have no job experrience
just lie.
always works
say you worked on a farm
or something
08,01or become an escort
stay out of my teritory
No Saturn, just no.
08,01Jmo: why not?
That's just wrong.
08,01there's nothing wrong with being paid for sex
No nononononnononoooooooooo
:D
I like not having an STD
good girl
having one ruins all the fun of getting one
08,01well, some STDs have non outward sympotms
I had sort of an internship with this startup mobile app company
08,01which is why you never have unprotected sex with a client
besides i get tested once every 2 months
but due to some legal issues that didn't end up working out very well
legal?
Saturn: it seems like you have a working business model. would you mind if i joined? :D
That involved you?
I guess some of the employees decided to basically steal the company from the owner
???
I was not told anything about it
they fired you?
08,01Alchemist: i could probably tell you more about the business than you ever wanted to know
pretty much
08,01but not in here
._.
Thats just fucked up
08,01Lyra`: i have several
emailed the owner a few months ago to try and find out why I was apparently fired and he told me all that
lets talk.
08,01i approve
AHEMMM
I don't exactly understand how employees can steal a company
Here's an idea, how about you move on from this shitty topic as children are around.
I don't either ._.
08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: floozying for money
could ask SR about it
No.
that does sound like something he'd know about
Heya everyone :)
aaaaw but it was entertaining me Jaymoo~
and hungry
I can see...
My only guess was that the employees had more stock than the owner
You wanna talk about this shit, take it to PM or another channel, honestly.
08,01okay, i actually have to agree that we're getting a bit carried away here
Ya think?
soooooooooo whats going on right now guise?
he is streaming
yes
Hi everybody :(
about to draw#
08,01though, personally, i don't think it's a topic that should be off-limits for the ages we get in here
but is he streaming anything? No. He is streaming a image.
08,01but yeah, let's change subject
this is their website http://sniffitapp.com/
I worked on the business section of that

He is streaming music

Saturn:Licks back
I think I have a problem. I can't stop listening to Babs seed
/me explodes
http://www.derpibooru.org/185417
Somehow the Babs Seed song didn't stay in my head O_o
kay
We do!
http://www.derpibooru.org/185409
You gotta see this!
05atleast when the singing starts
Which is in the style of Trap aparently.
Trap = rap, hip hop, and some other genre I can't think of.
I know same
/me doesn't listen to remixes on his own
... trap?
/me shrug
But the song is still good.
I guess.
How are traps gross? O_o
I'm digging these lyrics~
08,01hmm
The Lyrics start and then I get customer
Sooo. I missed it.
oh nvm
never heard about trap as a musical genre...
Saturn "An Excellent Planet"
but then again there are more musical genres than songs tbh.
dat paradoxical logic
I'd like to see the genre that has no music in it. :D
Sarcasm? What's that? How do you prepare it?
05oo this is a nice song :D
How dpes it taste?
I am smurt it
ok, I'm off for now, see you later
And they sound different? O_o
08,01well, it's not all that confusing
08,01the whole point of 4'33 is that the ambient sound of where you are is the music
08,01so it is, in effect, aleatoric
Saturn: of course not all are confusing, but some are.
I always thought he was some kind of nut-puncher :/
o fuck
a angry birds movie
you people did*
It wasn't me. D:
08,01Alchemist: is this an actual thing?

Saturn: it is
Saturn yes
Saturn 2016
it was bound to happen
ikr

Soccer moms just need a scapegoat to blame
fisting cows! yes
wat
mrcreepypasta reads about fisting cows
" he played counterstrike. therefore, counterstrike amde him murder people" by that logic we cant eat bread anymore. i'm sure the columbine shooters ate bread. bread makes killers
breathing makes you kill people
THINKING makes you kill people
i've heard they even wore clothes
OH FUCK!
I WEAR CLOTHES!
i'm dangerous!!!!
GUNS ARE BUILT FOR KILLING DUMBASSES
OF COURSE THEY KILL PEOPLE
=D
actually, guns dont kill people
people kill people
i kill people
with guns
aw yeah
more accurately people with guns kill people :D
jon lajoie
*fucker
We also hear about people stabbing people all the time, but we don't hear anyone demanding that we regular knives.

you obvipously never fired a gun
It takes LESS effort than a cleaver
Depends on the gun.
can i be held?
This song again. =D
yes!
boob?

08,01Kandarihu: we use knives
08,01er
08,01they use knives.
08,01or explosives
mostly booberry :P
08,01or legal guns, like hunting rifles
See? Bad guys use whatever they can get their hands on. They don't need guns if they want to kill a lot of innocent people.
:D
i didnt eat it yet
08,01guns don't kill people, bullets do
08,01i know because i saw a documentary on BBC 2
You could possible kill anyone with ANYTHING
and sea ponies
Yey :D
Nobody's allowed to have anything ever again ever because everything's dangerous!
can i have derpy m\plushies?
okay lets make a list of ridiculous objects to kill a person with

I think he's nearly out of them

You use ammo for currency?
Interesting
yup
only the military grade ammo
Why does a kid want ammo anyway?
Why else do you need ammo?
they pulled that bait shit in skyrim too
that's his payment?
one lousy smg mag=
I'm guessing Ammo is currency?
Yes it is
ITS A TRAP
doestn seem to be much ammo in the future
*there

00,10yeah if you have write to zero programs
00,10it works jsut fine

well its suppose to be linear
sorry to be mean but.... his AK sucks
Metro 2033
its Metro 2033
thanks
its trying to tell a story, not create a sandbox
or not
lol
see? that's why linear elvel design sucks
:I
oh mai gawd this gaim is laik K.O.D and it suck
he problem is that this is extreemely linear
games CAN be linear if they give you certianf reedoms
its not THAT linear.....
I've played much more linear games
AHHHHHHHHH
that is a flaw in level design
wanted or not
yes, but if it was TOO free, then how would they tell the story?
possibily, that doens't only happen in linear design though
well
"sandbox" like Far Cry 3 does not let you go to the second island until yo do all the missions
Skyrim is just bland
morrowind is horrible antiquated
Pony on Stream
http://i.imgur.com/i2J4Q.jpg
but skyrim is still good
it's exactly the same. they even use the same engine
oh and the gamebryo engine that bethseda uses is just horrible
dem QTEs
its bnot superior
yes
not stare at a picture
that doesnt make it surerior by default

not as important as the actual FUCKING GAMEPLAY
and ther i though we were talking about the last two centuries

People hated it?
well i saw a lot of negative comments towards it
a lot more than positie.
hm
I really liked it
7I ship all the ponies.
got slightly annoyed at Rainbow Dash for not admitting to any of the wrongdoing herself and blaming it all on that other girl

7 60% would be closer to average
05no strafe~
Par os 30s :o

Bye guise
/me bounces excitedly
YES

also, nice background
Well, its hard to explain
Yesh :)
That pic makes me sleepy
:)
If it's hard to explain
She is most likely NOT flirting with you
I need more caffiene.
Its like we are always talking to each other, and she acts differently than other girls - Like shes always smiling, she jokes around with me, we have a good time. It is also different than being nice
Cause she always talks to me
MERNCREFT!
Welcome to high school
