how do you guys use those pony head icons
DerpyPie.... I think we r related
<---
Motherfu-
you're also a combination of Derpy and Pinkie Pie
click on the smiley face
ultibrony: click the smiley next to the chat entry window
pony faces are automatic for emotes
ultibrony: You just type the associated smiley like : ) for :)
etc
Relax. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. At least until the mods decide to do it again.
O_O
Your right:O6_9
eeyup
ultibrony, click the smiley face
Fuuuuuuuu
One does not simply use pony emoticons
ofc you do
:O 6_9
like this
0,14I hope we hear a story from Ghostilee

11,01Stop.
PINKIE
YES!!!! YESS!!!!!!
I thought in G3 they called Rainbow dash Firefly.
PINKIE PIE IS BEST PONY (AND DERPY)
WRONG
F YEAH PINKIE PIE
Firefly was G1
firefly was g1?
yes
LUNA IS BESTEST PONY
yes she was
touche'
I <3 :P :O
that's who Faust based RD off of
mfw
Agreed
well i take it the movies not starting for a lwhile so im out
Pinkie was based off of Suprise.
In G3 Rainbow Dash was called Rainbow Dash
but she couldn't USE Firefly bc of copyright issues
Thanks i loved that yes i wassnet here from the start
so she used RD and made her a pegasus
and she always dressed in style :D
RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE.
:3
She could use Applejack though.
and made Pinkie a Earth Pony
in G3 RD was diva
swag
hey a;;
Dashie_Dashie always dresses in style
swag.mov
all*
What are they talking about exactly? :|
11,01Faust couldn't use some G1 names and styles.
In G4 G3 Rainbow Dash is called Rarity
G3 pinkie pie was earth pony, but her G1 character, Surprise was Pinkie pie
11,01Else, Pinkie Pie would be Surprise and Rainbow Dash would have been Firefly.
in pegasus form
Eeyup
stuff idk
She could only use Applejack from G1, G2 of or other gens.
eeyup
suprise would have been awesome
This is probably a good thing. Were Pinkie a unicorn-- the mind recoils. Someponies should not have magic.
yeah
Kencolt: your not kidding
Scary thought
Sweetie Belle is best Crusader
:S
I agree
sinkie + magic = discords world - discord
:S:S:S:S:S:S:S:S:S:S
awww
*pinke
i stopped watching a while ago
Everypony is best pony, thine pony should have the same respect as your favorite.

HAY BACON STRIPS!
LordCelestia is now legally and morally obliged to sing under punishment by ponntless and nonexistant law!
We must pay tribut to the patron god of meats. Baconus.

Lul what is it about?
not Baconus, Hamus
Bring forth the vegetarians for SACRIFICE!

Hamus is his Roman name
You put that meat in your mouth
carmine: ohhh bacon
No sex ref
how do i enter the house?
Baconus is the Greek.
and greek is cooler
TOY_PON3: smosh refrence?
yes
except for Hephastus. Vulcan was the better name.
10,02Was their favorite video games discussed?
Hey SuperBrony64.
Somehow I can't see Celestia presiding over the ritual slaughter of pigs. Ponies will, sadly, never know the joys of bacon.
amish rock farm
:D
thats what you think
WHY DO I KEEP GETTING LAG!?
hmm
10,02Ohai :3
Have we ever seen anypony eating anything meat?
08,01I'll ask.
otakon: Because you keep leaving to get drinks
bacon is probably like kokaine for ponies
oh har har
question: will the mane6 channels be closed again tomorrow?
:D
ponies are vegetarian.
Out of interest, and tell me if it's none of my beeswax, but what's the basment for?
ponies don't eat bacon :o
probably
probably
if Pinkie ate bacon, she'd explode
damn
twice
and what are there favorite pony episodes
they shouldn't, but they do
I was hoping for a definite answer
I've got a question. Have you guys got any favourite songs in the show? If yes, which ones?
otakon: can you do that?
dooo doooooo
can ponies do that, can they explode twice?
ask a mod
from an op, or something like that
yes
just like otakon ahouldn't drink, but does
Derpy did
once
pinkie can
can we just watch a movie?
the remaining bits would explode.
twice
pinkiederp: go do something the movie is COMING
drink what? cider?
will the mane 6 rooms be closed tomorrow
ik
yes
one sec, I'll find out
cider's good. even before it's been pony-approved
patience, pinkiederp
but im lazy
I have a drinking problem
and impatient
I'm THIRSTY
I have a Pinkie problem
Probably.
otakon: you need help bro...

moop: your lucky the mods didn't catch it, they'll kick ya for it
in case he doesn't, what was the pony episode that got them in the fandom?
It's not lupus.
otakon, go back to your drinking
lmao
I shall
A kick might help his memory
otakoThat's just what we say to our sure dead patiences... YOu've got two weeks to live
/me licks everypony
/me is licked.
Because the later entries suck in the final fantasy series.
08,01I'll ask anyway.
Oi SuperBrony64, did you come in, see my hello, then ignore my question after wards?
otakon: if i get kicked 1 more time i'll get banned:'( thats a hudge fear of mine i even had a nightmare about it last night lol
I thought I saw a wolf on the highway yestreday. Turns out it wasn't canis lupus.
I personally loved FF9.
anyone tried watching mlp while high?
*clings to 6 for dear life*
moop: Umm how many times have you been kicked?
10,02lol Nooooo >.>
4 was my favorite, but final fantasy 5 had better gameplay
And by that you mean "Yeeeeeees"
just me?

moop: kicks reset after time
But I forgive you.
Final Fantasy 6 was BEST FF game
period
otakon : Oh thank god

Mods are like the internet police
None of them did that well-- they made money, but were modest successes. then cane FF7 on the PS1, which freaking EXPLODED.
pony_666: Find out

TOY_PON3: you can't post R34 here, don't mention it again please

Give him two lips, like roses and clover...
what program is that?
/me glomp attack
0,14...whaaaaa
/me pokes SuperBrony64
10 was alright. 10-2 was....different
LooptyHoop: Chrono Trigger is ageless
And tell him that his lonesome dtimes are over!
SaxtonPretender?
FF X was, tyruly, a breakthrough graphically. And I liked the battle system...
what program is that?
6_9
It's a game
10,02O___o
Am I only one not to play FF?
GO ON!!!
08,01Went ahead and asked

PINKIE PIE
13why do you keep mass pinging...
Yup 666

I will admit i've never played a Final Fantasy Game
Well, that was nice :)
The Big Brony House*
/me didnt get pinged because SB
bc he loves us apparently
Shizuka because group hug
YES YES YES YES MOVIE IS ALMOST ON
moop and me together alone
/me loves the glomp love
give the SNES ones a look.
Me neither.
prepare for lag
And, I dinged again. What in the wide world of physics is going on?
*cracks knuckles*
First FF I played was 7
Glomp piles of wub
/me likes the way moop thinks
what is this I don't even
Sometimes I do not want a hug.
This is one of those times.
pony_666: you need emulators, I can give you a place to find them
pony_666: we are forever together alone
did you think Sephiroth was the coolest ever?
:)
FF 7 was good
but so much EMO
^
dude he just sounded like homer
I bought my original PS1 specifically to play FF7 and Lunar: Eternal Blue.
try final fantasy 4, you don't have to level grind that much in the beginning
simpson that is
otakon, like emulatorzone?
bloomberg
I like kingdom hearts bc i'm cool
/me joins with the rest of the chat giving one massive, visible-from-space style hug to Meanwhile.
Kencolt: Lunar remake was perfect
FF4 is tough though. Be wary
bloomberg: why do u like the way i think?
I think I broke SuperBrony64.
FF6 has a larger story and cast.
o___O
well the DS version that is
pony_666: nah, CoolRom is better
Y U No Liek Black Holes?
Wait-- no, I mispeak-- I played Lunar on the Sega CD. It was a LONG time befoer I got to play it on the PS1 remake.
Dashie_Dashie: Y would you do that?! :'(
I don't like black holes
i tried emulator before, but my pc crashed
I played FF7 once, and I don't remember names, characters, plot, the bad guy, or anything else important. But I do remember that the main guy had stupid hair.
the original snes version was pretty much easy mode
/me retracts his previous moop-related statement?
Kencolt: I said the remake was perfect
Hehehe
That was the US version. They dumbed it down and took a lot of features out.
Rarity is now marshmellow.
Could i get arrested if i tld u guys here that i pirate games?
Dken2021: the US FF4 WAS on easy mode
/me repels hug with the force of dispassion.
Party For One is best episode
what episode are they talking about?
bloomberg: :'(
moop no, just don't say it out loud
Rarity is best marshmeloow
Btw the program is TINYCHAT
u guys beleive colliding black holes makes wormholes or what?
Lesson Zero
what movies are we watching friday
oh btws
But the GBA version they put all the stuff back in and got a better translation.
I can't quite agree, Otakon. Visually better, smoother-- but the bosses were way easier on the PS1. the Sega CD version of Borgan was a BEAR to beat.
europonies are awesome
I LOVE The Last ROundup
Mine is Lesson Zero
/me gives Starflash a Eurobrony brohood /)
I just wanted to spread the luv with hugz
GBA was an awful port though
Nope
any ep with CMC is best ep
Jim (\
:(
Kencolt: you obviously never fought the last boss at level 49
Mine is also Lesson Zero
And Zophar-- oh WOW, was Zophar tough on Sega CD. Drive you CA-RAZY.
The CMC in the talent show was so painful to watch :(
Blazing Saddles, MY PICK!
My best weekend was IP man
bloomberg: Y U NO LIKE MY THOUGHTS?
you should be able to ping everypony with "Everypony" or something
/me gives MrDrProfIshBestPony a brohoof /) "That was so nice of you"
Top Secret!
Kencolt: he was TOUGH on PS1!
dumb fabric

@SuperBrony64 what are we watching friday
otakon: Y U so lag?
Trust me-- I have both versions. (Still have my Genisis and CD somewhere.) In comparisions, Zophar was cheese on PS1, but steel on the Sega CD.

Yes
What movie are we watching?

Nittany_Discord: legit?
where have i heard this song before?
11,01BronyState Gold gives you the stream + pony ep.
*gold
11,01Only $5 month.
Derpy elevator music
I'D LIKE A MUFFIN NOW...
Nittany_Discord: Sounds legit
How anticlimactic.
lol
TAKE MY MONEY
WHERE DO I PAY?
gonna take this opportunity to potty
$5 gold per month is less math 1 gram
is this winter wrap up?
11,01We'll have a PayPal set up soon.
Nittany_Discord: gold membership to what?
Hmmm... so, it's basically what we get now, except you have money to buy candy with?
11,01Bronystate.
GN everypony
id pay 5 bucks a month to get auth so I could kick the people who spam shed.mov
good night Rainbowjack
Do you have any idea how much weed I could get with $5 a month?
how long is this intermish?
Nittany_Discord: It gices us the Stream and Pony eps? How is that different from now?
gives*
11,01It isn't. We're just charging for it.
Wait i have to pay to go on BronyState?
@ Nittany_discord are you serious? i that legit?
/me dusts Nittany_Discord's face.
They get pocket money for mcandy. That's how it's difgferent.
Paying for Bronystate?
man, i get like half a gram of weed per moth instead
Mods, why nou download Desktop ponies?
Ictiv the difference is now they're scamming you out of money
i think its more to help with bills they have to pay
Guys.
I think it's trolololol.
MrDrProfIshBestPony: :|
dari
I feel trolled...
this intermissions been goin for like 90 mins
?
Dairy.
yes?
Yeah I supposed as much
#bronystateregulars, I...
That is why I brought it up
11,01We need our money, so we decided, after much deliberation, that we will charge for stream.
O U
:P
@ Nittany_Discord i will trade you $300 for admin powers
<batman> wha?
I never knew.
11,01K.
sounds legit
Trying to bribe the mods?
is that street(school) price for us.. $10 per gram?
not trying
Potassium.
So if we don't pay, we can't ... wait, what? So what does silver get?
Nittany_Discord: I'll pay but only because I love Bronystate
]succedding
i'll njust send y'all weed instead
11,01Silver gets you chat.
10,02Thanks for taking questions, great interview.
0,14...why do I feel scared
i'd buy pony buy the ton if it were a drug
Nittany_Discord: so those who don't pay won't get to watch streams?
wait are we SERIOUSLY going to have to pay?
i'm broke
Nittany_Discord, but I haz no moneyz
11,01Oh well.
yay a movie time
THank you Mr. SuperBrony64.
no they're trolling
10/10
:(
So 5 bucks for chat and stream?
for the love of Luna tell me shes trolling
Because now you're afraid you'll look out your window and it'll just be dari in boxers.
waz pup
If they're trolling then who charged my credit card?
pony_5943 we know they're trolling
...
she's trolling right.....RIGHT!!!
/me is so confused
11,01MasterBrony: I'm not a girl.
Nittany_discord says we are going to have to start paying for brony sstream
I cant tell if this is a joke or not
Legally it has tobe a troll. TO charge any fee would violate so many copyright laws Bronystate would be burned instantly.
Nittany_Discord: you are now!
no money, only weed and alcohol, so I send you 1 gram per 2 month
I guess it doesn't matter to much anyways. I'm here because I'm sick.
11,01....
@Nittany_discord sorry
/me 11,01dusts off MasterBrony
11,01No problem.
whats happening my movie wont load
I'm seriously wondering if this is serious or not.
Afraid, you mean looking forward to? ;)
I don't mind paying
0,14it's not =P
Maid_Discord: sowee
im am totally worried right now
Okay
im....im...really sc..scared do i have to pay now?
meh... i wouldnt pay
/me i totally worried right now

Meanwhile: I just looked out.. is Dari a mad man with a knife, dressed in clothes made of Pony Doll hair?
Oh wait
The movie isn't streaming yet. Patience.
That's not a knife
Dude.
/me is confused.
I usually spend 5 bucks or more at school snacks a week
Noise from outside my parents basement meens I should probably go now
10/10 if trolling
I'm looking forward to seeing how you'll get to this floor level, but if you do I must warn you the window opens outwards.
i can watch the episodes anytime, but i like bronstate for the chat
Were you looking in a mirror and not a window Ictiv? :<
that's a ceremonial butter spreader thingie
heh. I still can't believe Toonami Aftermath is still live-streaming after all these years
yea
TOY_PON3 do honestly think the mods would do that to us, the ones that aren't daru
Dats not Dari, dats probably SB
see you guys next week

Which is why I prefer Dragonshy or Secret of Excess
SMOOOZE

Maid_Discord: i think you're right, but since pinkie was originally surprise for FiM, shes pretty much canon

Same here Saxy

SaxyPretender: Good for you :P
my favorite episode is either The Last Round up, The Return of Harmony part 1 and 2, or Sonic Rainboom
I have chocolate truffles

Rarity going crazy turned me off on that episode.
MY DOG IS STANDING ON THE SHIFT BUTTON
There was also Star sparkler instead of Twi or Rarity, and Firefly was Rainbow dash, And somepony else was Fluttershy.(Posey)
LOL

flutter-spi: i kind of liked that episode but i think i would put it at like 30

I like ballet
i mena nutcracker
11,01WTF? They're packing...
0,14...that's some...tight tights
something is off here
Baby Cakes had the unique (so far) distinction of Pinkie Pie learning a serious lesson. And learning it well to boot.
Thats what you call a nut cracker!
Another film? Cool!
Other than that I found the same twitter account belonging to someone named Dariana
and white powder
BA DUM CHING
Really guys, there are men with extreme boners and you're talking about Baby Cakes?
I guess because it reminded me of the Incredibles extra scene of the babysister taking care of the superhero
Pinkie Pie made baby cakes work
Like...3 times by affiliation to random people who mentioned the name in their tweets

The ponies of equestria probably made a conscious effort to change this -considering that having a stallion with three or four mares was terrible sexual arithmatic.
Hardware store FTW

They say their clothes are an important part of their identity so they don't want to wear a uniform.
I know english is bad, but it's the most commonly used for business

Good lord. Like a hand in glove.

And I dislike new Offspring, too.
Sumica: it's not padding if it's EXPLAINING why they're fighting, explaining WHY the characters do what they do is better than just "THEY'RE EVIL!"
It went from "Mad shit" to "PARTY HARD"

Simon: good, it's damn depressing
0,14...unfortunately, it was the ep where Asuka got mind screwed using Ode to joy
my god so damn DEPRESSING
big robot thingy Simon
13video is giving away every major plot point of the series
0,14which put me off
Shizuka: eeyup
oh yes, that
13but there is a severe lack of asuka :<
Shizuka in such quick succession and most of the series is psychological anyway
okay brb
10,02I personally have no clue what is going on O__O
My brother gave me a video which is part of an Eva movie, he said it's the most discusting anime he've ever seen
japan SB japan
This show was weird anyways, Saxy. You had to really like it to get through it.
SuperBrony64: you're no the only one.
13there she is <3
Do you ever, SB?
13was
13is <3
BOOBS.
SB has all clues about wub
00,10and then shiji rubed one out on her
10,02My mind is basically that 'LA LA LA LA' video 24/7
._.
0,14for all I josh about EVA being "QQ some more the series", I do respect the series
Occupy #bronystate.
Sumica: Well....did any girl in that show manage to NOT get laid by Shinji?
13eva is "It Got Worse" the series
00,10rebuild is better
13^^^^^^^^^^^^
13canary~<3
SuperBrony64: I'd feel bad for the doctors if you ever had to get brain surgery.
Ay finally
SuperBrony64: your not the only one.
;^;
0,14I've heard Rebuild is more optimistic
open up your head
suddenly more mods
suddenly
Shizuka: yh, by the factor of 100
LALALALALALALA
My computer was being terrible....
why do these robots bleed?
0,14meaning I'm willing to give it a shot
Mortyirc: not robots
13rebuild is amazing and a half
Also, I havent watched Eva, but I can sing the theme pretty well.
00,10We could watch it here if DCD would ever let me
13unfortunately it's movie length...
10,02You know that feeling, when you lean back in your chair and the moment right as you know you're about to fall back over? That's how I feel all the time.
Good night everypony... I've been here since 5 AM, with only a break to buy ponies at Target and get Burger King... My brain is full of buck. :$

How about just put all of season one on.

Twilight room was fine. Think Pinkie Pie room was good too. Chat was calm on spoilers
Pretty hilarious-- and seeing the CMC actually fix one of their mistakes was granting hope.

The marathon was kind of surprising for me. Luna Eclipsed got first place.

otakon: really? i might be able to find it... gimme a moment
so is Super Mario 64
a game
I've been wanting too play the original Fallouts but never had the chance.
bioshock is a game
herostar: it's a FPS heavy on story with customizable weapons and powers called "plasmids"
it's pretty good
and cheap
I don't like horror, which is why I stayed away from Bioshock and Amnesia
What sysem do you have flutter?
Who pinged me?
otaken i ment the ones after Oblivion and Fallout3
dear god i know skyrim but not bioshock
lol
Bioshock isn't horror
