I side with val, not much of a fanfic person myself
0,14Val left? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ok then
to sign up for the newsletter I have to contact an operator, right? - any volunteer Operator wants to sign me up?
08,01I decided on my name as it was a childhood nickname.
3ValNOOOOOOOO

DAMMIT
MmmHmm
And?
how do you guys use those pony head icons
<---
Motherfu-
you're also a combination of Derpy and Pinkie Pie
click on the smiley face
pony faces are automatic for emotes
etc
Relax. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. At least until the mods decide to do it again.
O_O
Fuuuuuuuu
One does not simply use pony emoticons
ofc you do
:O 6_9
like this
0,14I hope we hear a story from Ghostilee
thanks
xD
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9

11,01Stop.
PINKIE
YES!!!! YESS!!!!!!
PINKIE PIE IS BEST PONY (AND DERPY)
WRONG
F YEAH PINKIE PIE
yes
LUNA IS BESTEST PONY
yes she was
touche'
I <3 :P :O
mfw
Agreed
In G3 Rainbow Dash was called Rainbow Dash
Thanks i loved that yes i wassnet here from the start
and she always dressed in style :D
RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE.
:3
She could use Applejack though.
and made Pinkie a Earth Pony
in G3 RD was diva
hey a;;
swag.mov
all*
11,01Faust couldn't use some G1 names and styles.
In G4 G3 Rainbow Dash is called Rarity
She could only use Applejack from G1, G2 of or other gens.
This is probably a good thing. Were Pinkie a unicorn-- the mind recoils. Someponies should not have magic.
yeah
Scary thought
I agree
:S:S:S:S:S:S:S:S:S:S

First FF I played was 7

This is one of those times.
did you think Sephiroth was the coolest ever?
:)
FF 7 was good

simpson that is
I like kingdom hearts bc i'm cool
FF4 is tough though. Be wary
FF6 has a larger story and cast.
o___O
well the DS version that is
Wait-- no, I mispeak-- I played Lunar on the Sega CD. It was a LONG time befoer I got to play it on the PS1 remake.
/me retracts his previous moop-related statement?
Hehehe
That was the US version. They dumbed it down and took a lot of features out.
Rarity is now marshmellow.
/me repels hug with the force of dispassion.
Rarity is best marshmeloow
Lesson Zero

europonies are awesome
Mine is Lesson Zero
I just wanted to spread the luv with hugz
