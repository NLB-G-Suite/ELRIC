Midnight_Fyre: so the dinosaurs can live
Fun Fact: There are only 15 minutes of actual dinosaur footage in the film: 9 minutes are Stan Winston's animatronics, 6 minutes of it is ILM's CGI.
Pinkie, that's not a T-Rex. That's a velociraptor.
cue theme song
Ghosties: no---n-no shit :D
it's funny how these are still one of the most realistic cgi effects
Funny how all the cartoon parodies of this implied the dinosaurs were all done with animatronics.
Midnight_Fyre: They simply could. And they did so -because- they could.
No, it's a ULTRASAUR.
i have trouble figuring out if its a puppet or if its CGI'
So, how did they do it?

Thats right, engneer them all female so that if someone can simulate a sex cell the dinosaurs will be able to carry children

Fun Trivia: Except for some very brief glimpses in the opening scene, the adult velociraptors - often cited as the most memorable dinosaurs in this film - don't make an on-screen appearance until over 103 minutes into the movie. Nothing about the sounds they make though

Why didn't they kill it before sending it in? Answer: a) The dinosaurs are picky and only eat live prey, or b) Mr. Millionaire doesn't even care.

Whether cows lived or not, they're herbivore meat.
Why does everyone care about the cow, we do the same thing in slaughter houses
HIS SHORTS
They ain't that big either
Reikim: I think it's a little of column A, little of column B.
The raptors aren't THAT picky.
magmablock: we shouldn't create dinosaurs in the first place
This scene is genius, btw. Gives you a taste of their danger without showing you them at all, leaving it as a big reveal.
no the raptors
Shizuka: no problem :)
Awesome reference Shiz. Love that movie.
Precautions :D <_<
Lionel?
Based on Bleach logic, we never saw the cow die, therefore she's still alive.
You think they'd start with just one raptor.
Oh Mai
Shizuka, the twister stole all the cows
The big one. She knows the maths
Clever girl
Exept for Twist
futtershy would is going all crazy at this very momment
ads...
Because they wasted what could be meat for us.

All_the_homestuck_po: I already said that!
Lunac: thanks :)
Hey Fluttershy, want some co-- I MEAN oranges?
I wonder what happened to the eaten cow. .__.
she is planning exactly how to kill you.

You know what? It would make more sense to just drop the cow into the pen without lowering anything down there that would be retrieved after feeding time.

Would Jurassic Park have served dinosaur meat?

The former was for the daytime scene in which the creature fails to appear, and the latter for its nighttime escape, in order to accommodate Stan Winston's robotic t-rex.

Better than most zoos

THEY SPEELED SOME OF THESE NAMES WRONG AND SOME OF THEM ARE FAKE
awsome jarasic park!
I dont know why.
ITS SPELT WRONg!!!!
If only Samual L Jackson grabbed a gun to fight dinosaurs, then this movie would be 200% cooler

Yeah, Malcon... be the hero...
Fun TRIVIA: In the shooting script, it was written that, during the Tyrannosaur's escape, Malcolm would simply get out of the car and run away, much as Genarro had done moments before. In fact, this is how Malcolm behaves in the scene as written in the book. When the time came to film the scene, it was Jeff Goldblum's idea to make his flight more heroic, by having him distract the Tyrannosaur so Grant could save the children

That cliff has an extremely high stealth score.

....oh shit that's a long drop
Shizu: Spike, The Friendly T-Rex?
that ass
Fun Trivia: The full-sized animatron of the tyrannosaurus rex weighed about 13,000 to 15,000 pounds. During the shooting of the initial T-rex attack scene that took place in a downpour and was shot on a soundstage, the latex that covered the T-rex puppet absorbed great amounts of water, making it much heavier and harder to control.
Booty
Oddly coincidental how the T-Wrek is missing.
I have really small arms... and a really big head, I just have to question the thought that went into this plan...."
:O: Maybe he wants a party

Sumica, awesome. Maybe they'll just make a fake tourist out of goat meat and beef, skin it to look like a human, and animate it with cheap easily digestible electronics so that the other tourists don't realize it's fake. When the T-Rex eats it, the real tourists will flip their lids with excitement!

Fun TRIvia: The computer in the back of the computer room with the many (65536) red LEDs is actually a real computer: The Connection Machine CM-5 made by Thinking Machines. It contained many SPARC 2 RISC processors and the LEDs were added to make the machine more aesthetically pleasing than their previous models. Unfortunately, it was not actually a very good supercomputer and the company failed not long afterward.

Well.. you let Arnold stroll down the road...
FUN TRIVIA: The gun that game warden Muldoon uses is an Italian Franchi SPAS 12, a commonly used gun in films due to its aesthetic modern appearance.
Shizuka and they keep asking where it has gone?
And you'd be T-reex-ninja chow
Goldburg speaks the truth
that's prophetic actually
oh yeah
Shotgun time

stupid geico... GO AWAY!

if you cant hear a 50 t tank you cant hear a 5t dino

youre gonna need a fucking 8 guage to take down one of those fucking things
That's not a regular shotgun. that's the UBERGUN
Always take the shotgun.
Shizuka: WHY?
05,15tavi_lover7 get adblocker

Ghosties: But the real question is, would it make them invisible?
Ad Block is your friend
Progressive is BETTAH
04tavi_lover7: get adblock plus
IshCleverGirl: good thing the dinosaurs are part of the wicked witch of the west family
USE ADBLOCK.

tavi_lover7: they always had ads
a XaiphCo product
honestly, if I was in a park like that, I'd want at least.... at LEAST... a squad automatic weapon x.x
team of 4, auto shotties, and a large extremely strong creature? its l4d3, theya re the survivors and the t-rex is a tank
Shizuka: yes, but now you cant use it either
yeah i got no ads
Shotgun + raptors eyes = problem solved, thick hide really not the issue
Shizuka: what if he stole them?
lolnope
Adblock is best
more like shotgun vs t-rex eye's
Goldblum stop lying down like that!!
It's 2012 and people still dont have Adblock :|
Lol sexist
He tries to be galant
I am old?
nierd
he's a guy, your a girl... could get sexy
Shizuka: so now we are BOTH screwed
So awkward.
Old man + Sexism = comedy
i'd have to get a premium account to get rid of those adds
Moar Adblock spam!
I think he was going that way
XD best pony XD
04Well, do you think a scientist is going to knowingly try to recreate Jurassic Park?
13yep

Why don't everyone have a gun?

Cachuck!
Shizuka: whatever, WHY IS THE RUM GONE?

13so your argument is invalid
Lol that scottish sexism
But she insists on going into the hunting grounds
not with hammond i hope
shhhhh. be vewy vewy quiet. im hunten dinosaurs
Fun Trivia: The first generation shotgun stock was designed so that a spring loaded stud mounted on the interior of the stock locked into the rear sight. By pulling this stud rearward it clears the sight and the stock can be unfolded. Muldoon can clearly be seen depressing this stud when he is hunting the Velociraptors moments before his famous "clever girl" last words.
At the theme park, with the raptors, is where I'm going to be~
time to start walking
they're the ones that interrupt the movie
Shizuka: well i stole your face
That hat is SO bad ass

Why did he leave a loaded shotgun?
It annoys me to no end
Quick use a step ladder

FuN Trivia: At one point Lex is hanging from a floorboard between stories. She looks up for a moment. The stunt double looked up accidentally while filming and Ariana Richards' face had to be superimposed in post production.

Fun Trivia Alternative: In the original script, the T-Rex skeleton in the lobby was hooked up to pulleys like a giant marionette. In the ending, Grant was going to man the controls and act as puppeteer, using the skeleton's head and feet to crush the raptors.
we all love you to trex
quietest helicopter ever c:
IshCleverGirl: just because this is the internet doesn't mean I have to believe everything on it

SHIT'S OVER
hmmm it's 4am should i still stay up for rat race
There was a BOOK!?
Fun parallel situation of prop: The helicopter used in the movie was later involved in an accident in Hawaii in March 2001. In the accident, the chopper dropped ten feet to the ground, bounced back up and then tipped on its right side.
THE ICE CREAM
I wonder what they did with the island. Did they wait for all the dinos to die? Did they firebomb it? What happened?
Get a good look
he stays to die
When leet dinos owned j00.
he IS best pony
00,10they did in book Shizuka
YES, star wars marathon
and herold the helicopter saves the day again
btw lost world was better than original. just sayin.
Shizu: Would make too much sense, silly filly
Just realized that one of the cars got away.
the island was burned down.
00,10well not nuke
The nightmare is over
So when they get away and tell everyone about this, why doesn't the government just firebomb the whole damn place?
:(
And then they all went home and nuked the island from space
I was on the T-Rex side.
i said that during the beginning
00,10but firebombed
in the book he just kind of dies like a chump
yeah, by michael crichton
all of it was the mosquitos fault
Vordox, that's real??
has heart attack and dies
@Shizuka: Because it's an island. Those dinos aren't going anywhere
cowvarkian I didn't say you have to believe everything on the internet, just everything I say
tomservodoctor42: dont worry, I got them right here!
:'(

IshCleverGirl: >.> no, thanks
Back
Shizuka: not unless they learn to swim
by a wing of B-52's with Napalm.
firebomb right Sumica ?
Yay
I prefered the ending where the T-Rex eats the chopper
Vordox: Lawl you said ass.
Shizuka, they're counting on the life not finding a way to produce that critical amino acid.
cowvarkian: Well, I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals.
And Dinos get extinct agin
FUCKIN' MOSQUITO
