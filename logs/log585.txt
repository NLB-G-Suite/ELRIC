Seriously, this Paul guy is awesome...whoever he is...
Sumica: Hey Jude
O U
RAWRity BLASPHEMY!!!!
He is like a hundred years old; so of course his voice would be weaker.
:D
sagas: Paul didn't write imagine
11,01Hey Sumica.
VenHur96: Paul McCartney, Beatles you know.
Meanwhile: Just Love and Tolerate :)
08,01VenHur96: can't tell if trolling
00,10hey nitt
VenHur96 ...
Paul McCartney's really getting older, sadly.
04It's Paul McCartney, one fourth of the legendary Beatles
Look at this.
Obvious trolling is obvious
CCCP: I know but he often covers it
HEY JUDE!!! <3
Paul either looks younger, or it's 240p
His music's bloody timeless though. :)
Don't be messing with me
Needs moar Beatlebrony :$
Where's my lighter, i need to wave it in the air
/me waves her hooves in the air
I greatly dislike the Beatles

LoveandTolerate: :I No. Go away.
He really is past his prime
Bigjack: 240p live stream

SuperBrony64: don't leave!
Don't let the door hit you on the way out SB.
I bet there's someone on Wikipedia updating the pages of all the famous people involved in this opening ceremony :)
Mandelbrony: Awwww
Makeshift cauldron
EVERYPONY WAVE YOUR HOOVES.
08,01sagas: how the fuck do you get to antisemitism from "hey jew"?
Someone better get this on video, and send it to youtube
Meanwhile: stop that ya snarky one.
He's 70!?
did I miss the A movie
Acleps: It's probably already done
04I'm not really a fan either, but I have to give every ounce of respect ever to Paul and the rest of the Beatles, living and dead. They really blasted a landmark into the foundation of sound and music
So are we all awake now for moovie night?
but seriously though, I've never felt the Beatles' music actually justified the reverence they recieve.
*waves cellphone for the lack of lighter*
VenHur96: Try listening to Beatles in reverse. It seems [redacted]!
Stay SuperBrony64!
He sure doesn't look 70!
Wish Joh and George were still alive. :(
I adore the Beatles.
So... what exactly is this place?
Who the helll is Paul McCartney?
He can't be 70! Unless that's a wig or he dyed his hair...
The wait is worth it, the first pony episode contains copious amounts of Sweetie Belle :S
trollhunter: No A movie yet

What about Maxwell's Silver Hammer?

Paul was 64 back when he was 64! :$ props to you fans who get that.! :)
Eulshy you didn't just ask that
RAWRity you listen to Bieber, your argument is invalid
Eulshy,... really have to ask that
it was something of the era RAWRity
party soft!
you damned juds
*kids
When I'm 64!
Agreed. I don't like them, but I respect what they did for music. That being said, they aren't all that great in terms of skill, and not the best band ever
Eulshy: He was the bassist of the Beatles but when they broke up, he had his solo career
If you hate The beatles, it's safe to assume that you're probably a douche bag.
dat lipsync
holy shit I'm bleeding!
God bless the Beatles!
08,01sagas: that's not being anti that religion or rae
Ryunosuke: lol juds
08,01*race
otakon: even within their own era, there were bands doing what they did, but far better
HERE IT COMES :D
SkeksIshPony: Just proves that bad music can get large fandoms.
brb, gonna go find Elushy
CCCP: Yes sir
and we are still feeding him
Stop singing and get on with it already!

SkeksIshPony: 1: I don't listen to Bieber. 2: I can guarantee I'm more informed on music history and music in general than you.
08,01NaNNaNNaNNaN
Hey Luna~

NANANANA
So what exactly is this place?
08,01hey jude
where is Luna :x?
Eulshy*
FUCK YEAH!]
Lucid: Fair enough, they're not the best band ever or anything. But the contributions of that band are hard to discredit.
Meanwhile: You need to style your moustache like Paul had his in 1967
it's otakon. He has to tell us everything.
why did they choose this song?
Tyunosuke: Bazinga
still :)
HEY JUDE!!! :D :D :D :D
CCCP: i hate the Bea... i hate the B.... goddamnit youre right D:

Apply pressure, if it's small wash and band-aid, if it's a large laceration then wrap it in gauze and get the fuck over to a clinic.

That's some loud audience interaction
He ALWAYS manages this with Hey Jude.

This isn't British without the Doctor
11,01Who's OC are we watching?
IDK, but Sonic and Mario will make another game

Damn you, Paul McCartney!
woohoo...
VenHur96, how can no doctor be a good thing

Mr. Bean!!!
Russia for the Winter games? Makes sense, as they're probably one of the few countries with a consistent snow season at this point.
01,11Mr. Bean
We missed james bond?
Master Disco summoned him, hahahahaha
04Mr. Bean is better than The Doctor
ok admins, that's enough olympics for now

sergio_scriptor: Oh for crying out loud, no one cares.

JAMES BOND? WHY DIDN'T I COME EARLER@?@@??!?!?!!

THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED
No doctor, I am disapoint...
Wait.. Mr. Bean was there?
Reikim: eeyup
Ghosties: RIGHT ON
Doctor Who....
or was that the misheard lyrics?

Doorman: No, YOU missed James Bond.
Meanwhile: i care :'(
Ghosties, you make me giggle. With disdain.

/me couldn't give two shits about The Doctor but Mr. Bean is the fucking shit
When did James Bond figure into this>
Ghosties: No, Mr Bean IS best Doctor

sergio_scriptor: Ok, so no one important cares.

So we had James Bond, Mr. Bean, but no Doctor Who.
You mean his name is Blackadder?

01,11I bet it's warm down there.
Meanwhile: that is just mean :'(
lets watch first mlp episode then movie ;D
So othat cauldron design
it got a little iffy in the middle, but pretty good overall
There was a TARDIS sound effect somewhere in there
Have you not seen Mr Bean as the Doctor Ghosties?
Did you know Mr Bean once did a Doctor Who sketch?
James Bond and the Queen jumped out of a helocopter
04Wait, did Pierce show up...or was it that new guy?
It's brilliant
Completely epic
Seriously wat da hell

CCCP: Oh I certainly do that.

04I remember seeing the one with Sarah Jessica Parker on Disney years ago when I was a little kid in the 90's
Mining...for glass.
dat voice crack
i doubt that was a voice crack
This song upraged me for a reason, why Celestia didn't has her own song yet?
this is INCREDIBLY beautiful

"Hocus Pocus"
also known as sand
cant tell if its supposed to be creepy or not
I...
that wasnt a voice crack, it was intentional
And then the children died...

/me fails to compute
HOLD ON IT'S PONIES AND WARRIOR CATS.
Hey all

RANDOM QUESTION: If you woke up in this world out of nowhere and managed to get away from all of thes... "native creatures" what's the first thing you would do?
how long is this movie? 40 minutes?
Oh no, there is a female Gelfling.
wait... did the master even tell him what he's supposed to do with the shard once he finds it?
PinkiePieYoshi64: find weaons
/me checks
PinkiePieYoshi64: Find a portal to Equestria.
find shelter?
BOOTAY BOOTAY BOOTAY
Anyone Japanese in here?
PinkiePieYoshi64: or burn anything that gets near me
lol? Right now it feels like it will be over in 20 minutes
inkBot: The script didn't extend that far
PinkiePieYoshi64: shoot myself
PinkiePieYoshi64 monolog
04So the female looks like a male and the male looks like a female
/me raises hand
inkBot: He told him he had to shave the world with it
xD
inkBot: I don't think so
yep
00,10so much jrpg
damn....
CriticKitten XD
wow
ok, that is AWESOME
04Yep, Sumi is right
Dat CGI.
...Really?
im back :)
THAT'S AMAZING
04This is totally a JRPG
11,01Ghosties: And dress the same way.
what is this moive called again?
VenHur96: THE FUCK YOU SAY
01,11That's not CGI.
Nope... No CGI
in the US on a student visa
Ghosties: Rule 63, my friend.
daym...
ah!
Are you really Japanese, RAWRity?
Wow
VenHur96: that is ALL physical effects
seems legit
RPG game movie
no cgi here, buddies
Hey it's the Astro Orbiter ride at Disney World
What Silverscreen said.
The Dark Crystal.
How is this CGI?
dogface
I heard a woah
00,10it's only a model
/me lied
...Was not expecting that.
They actually built that thing
Well, I love JRPGs
Yea thats not cgi
ITS NOT CGI
This is all mechanical. Your mind is now blown.
SCIENCE!! :D
Yeah I thought so
04HMM? HMM?
Oh, sorry....
are they pretending epicycles exist?
VenHur96 its 83 ... I daubt its CGI
the puppets are damn good
whats zit for?
None of this is CGI. This is all hand made.
04That's not CGI
u dont know?
HE LOOKS LIKE A FUCKING REAL-DOLL!
04That's a prop..a model
1982 all special effects were more done by hand drawn animation or real made stuff.
No CGI
So, no Japanese chatter, therefore no Japanese sexy time
my fuck this movie is stupid, but interesting
dat duck
....are they in that one planetarium from FF7?
Oh, it's a 1983 film...my bad.
11,01Moving and chopping parts offf.
Zanon: physical effects are awesome
oops, it's a binary star system.
Reikim tentacle based sexy time = japanese sexy time
04Such a JRPG
I sense Yoda...
00,02this is an impresive bit of footage
owloysius: actually it's three stars
gahhh
Ah Dark Crystal, 1 of 3 animated dark films I like that were made in 1982
Tentacles do not imply sexy.
CONJUNCTION JUNCTION WHATS YOUR FUNCTION
00,10so this kid is the avatar
spinny spin spinning things spin spin spins
There sure are a lot of bodies in that system.
Whoever made that THING should of wonned an Oscar!
i can't deal with the three body problem
I suppose the five o'clock shadow is spreading, leaving the whole world in darkness, Silverscreen
Squallken: wait there were more?
Do 3-star systems exist?!?
sagas: maybe
:P
Reikim you clearly haven't watched enough hentai
That thing is ugly.
Does anyone see Wander from the male "Giffling"?
04Ask me what time it is, I dare you
maybe 2 stars rotating around a center?
6_9
Dari: And the shadow is making the world die, obviously
Are we in a hentai here?
END OF THE WORLD...... or the beginning....
WORRRRLD
END OF THE WORLD!
/me checks
....which is it?
ABANDON ALL HOPE
well ones i liked
if you think so
brb
00,10she sounds just like every other religon
Death Reliqs!
I certainly hope not
why not both
END OF THE WOOOOOORLD
Ghosties: What time is it
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Jim Henson personally trimmed twenty minutes from the film after a disastrous preview in San Francisco. Henson also ordered many of the character voices re-dubbed to eliminate some of the invented character languages to make the film more accessible and the plot easier to follow.
2012
Puppet hentai would be creepy, to say the least
BIG CHANGE!
04It's 8:25, silly :D
No, end and beginning are NOT the same.
IN MY PANTS!
Puppet hentai si best hentai
Technically, yes Sagas. A triple system with planets, however? That would be something to see.
00,10take your pick
is*
04I'm not going to understand this movie
CriticKitten: every ending is a beginning
damn...
CriticKitten: End of one thing is the beginning of another.
04I just know I'm not
is that glass
so many soul gems
dat's a lot
11,01What's the function of the world-ending conjunction?
This guy is new Yoda
dont know
take them all
:D
main character points out plot hole
.....
she knows everything about nothing
/me stares
movie says stfu
Egh..
if theres tentacles, its japanese sexy time, period, no questions asked
"Questions, too many questions" Somehow I get the sense that was Henson's response to the audience after watching this movie
I can't unsee that now
no time
04I wish neither was dead
Take them all, try each one.
Nittany_Discord: 2t^2+9t
00,10thing a majig is ticking.
04Hah, probably Critic
01,11It'll all make sense at the climax.
CriticKitten: What the hell did he expect!?
Cut the blue wire!
11,01That's an expression.
04I wonder if Jin was the basis for the female lead in Avatar
Take all three!

We were paying more attention to the wings

You can't cut a torrent off at the source, because there are potentially thousands of seeders.
And trust me, the only thing that'll happen if a company finds a torrent is that they'll sent a Cease and Desist warning to the website hosting it, and that'll be it.
he got crabs
CRAB. BATTLE!
whoa
crab battle
now hes gonn get beat do deth
01,11This would be a great scene to put Dave Chapelle's "We are the crabs" song over."
They'd have to monitor the activity of every internet connection in the world.

Those crabs can't hit crap
He's screwed...
like what happened with Ponychan.
seriously, HOW did he get out of there?
HOLY SHIT
Yeah, escape into the LAVA PIT.
Lava
Torrents are addresses guiding systems to link up and share data. You can't really monitor that.
What I missed?
er, not ponychan
nearly there
That place looked nice and cool
As Nittany_Discord was saying earlier, condoms. This is why you use them
Because you're seriously not in any worse place than you can be right now.
Silverscreen: Especially because of the ''Death by Lava''?
and then he died
OF COURSE

EspyLacopa: he's never climbed before
I've been torrenting for forever though, and never gotten anything
If when a mystic or skexie dies, a corresponding opposite dies
fizgig is cute, I don't know why, maybe because he's fluffy
RX-78-LazyBot: all ISPs are dicks
All the msytics should just kill themselves

Ogra, best person!
she has life 3 on her
Nittany_Discord: dude we saw people get the LIFE sucked out of them.
this reminds me of the never ending story so much
01,11RANDOM EXPOSITION: When the Crystal was cracked, the ancient beings that guard it and the land were split in two: The mystics and the skeksis. The Skeksis took the negative, cruel and greedy personalities of the guardians, while the mystics were righteous and peaceful. The Skeksis, too enthralled with their power and the pleasantries of being cruel, drove the mystics out and took
1,11control of the crystal’s tower.
just not her turn yet
FIZGIG LIVES!!!

And if anyone knows where the line rests, it's RAWRity
Also, I'd like to note that in the picture there, Rarity already has her make-up applied. Implying she's been...waiting.
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Pre-production work revolved around Brian Froud's designs without a finished script. When Froud originally presented Jim Henson with concept drawings for the crystal, Henson seemed totally perplexed. When Froud asked why, Henson said he had no idea what the designs were for.
9.4/10
dat background
01,11[CONT.] As it turned out, Froud had misunderstood Henson during early production conversations - Henson intended the film to be called "The Dark Chrysalis," referring to the Skesis dominance over the world. Henson, however, loved the concept art and integrated the idea of the crystal into the storyline.
8/10
Ghosties: I was about to say WHOA when the hell did the Rangers get involved with this?
No Jim and Frank didn't do the voices they just worked the puppets

secret of nimh is awesome remember seeing that as a kid when it came out.

Meh. That movie had little to nothing good to offer beyond cliches it probably wrote. xD But it really wasn't that good. 5 or 6 out of 10.
/me just came in the middle of the movie.......the visuals and the character design were interesting, but the voice acting was poor, there was unnecesary filler, and............i really need to look at it again before doing a full analysis........ This is the Angry Fanboy, signing off
Drive ssafe then! :)
04The whole credits should be nothing more than Jem staring into the character like earlier

SCOOTALOO
13i am also trying to not go insane
NICE DRAWING
00,03Darn right we get to see Scoots play the piano!
I figured since Fluttershy was a model, she'd have a slim, fairly flat-chested build
PARRRIS
00,03MLG PART!
Grown like a particularly adorable patch of moss.
Shizuka: what?

MLG?
DERPY

sometimes you wonder why they haven't got their cutie marks yet
BRB
00,03Like Scoots, I too suck at singing :P
Scootaloo is best singer
Applebloom's cutie mark should be a hammer and an apple blossom like it is in For Want Of a Dawn
How did Applebloom NOT get her cutie mark from doing all that work on the clubhouse!?! O.O
I hear it's frightening if not severely traumatic on both a physical and mental level.
trollhunter hopefully
FouLou I closed the site right at the moment you rplied... I only heard the ping -.-
THEM ZONG?
Scoot-Scootaloo: I went bowling Scootaloo-style today.
Jesus was a carpenter. Apple Bloom special talent is Carpentry. APPLE BLOOM IS JESUS!

Spike is a snarky little guy.
Apparently "NO!" makes everything better.
>Walks in without saddlebags
My cutiemark would have to do with digital logic. I love games, robotics, electronics, but I have a CRAZY knack for routing digital logic without the use of a computer to do the work for me. :$

I notice the mixing with Technomix about 20 secs beforehand
Back. How much of the Movie Night did I miss in the last 3 hours

13it was like $1 during sale though
13so much +m
RAWRity: the demo is from what that site said
Didn't even have that much when I got around to buying stuff in the sale. :/
01,11Yes, a few aspects are old hat and cliche, but the story is creative and original, the design is enjoyably dark, the characters, while kinda cliche, are enjoyable and at least a little memorable, and above all, it has this sense of timlessness to it, just like almost any project Henson's been a part of.
Five minutes left for the mission!
Where was Gondor when random +m

0,14I just know Max Von Sydow from the Skyrim trailer and Judge Dredd
Godon's alive?!
04Because for bronies to know Flash Gordon would require them to be over the age of 25...and there are hardly any bronies these days that old
Phase4: Sure.......
Phase4 yes

It's Flash Gordon. He'll punch you at lightspeed.

Hot fail
RAWRity: what is the catch?
otakon: Actually, to be honest, I don't has the comics, but judging that this is an B movie, the comic series must of lasted... 30 issues?
pinkyspice: But some PCP it will be the same
04It's just how I've seen the fandom sway in terms of age
i think it's out...
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Sam J. Jones was cast in the role after being spotted by the mother-in-law of Dino De Laurentiis on an episode of The Dating Game
wat is dis
but I am waiting on my $25 gift card
VenHur96: actually it was a long lived series
have they remade this in BluRay yet?
04Started out 20 somethings, and now it consists of many late teens
Only to find out later that she's actually a drug addict, and Fairy Dust is a dangerous hallucinogen. Now you have to choos between pushing this young girl away and helping her with her sickness, or feed into her fantasy to pursue a relationship
struck by the worst disaster of all... buffers
NEW*
hot girl
otakon: Oh.
Ghosties, i'm 37 :p
It started as a serialized comic strip, then became radio serials, then film serials, then this movie, then a really shitty tv series on the SyFy channel
...Well, at least it's not Yume Nikki.
one of the endings has her dying of a drug overdose
ahem
00,10old man
I love the border on the screening
04I'm not saying older bronies aren't around :P
/me breathes in
shut it kid
ha
I know a brony the same age as my parents
Dude this thing just started buffering out of nowwhere.... I have no idea why- it was working fine all day
Ghosties: Oi. I'm at least not a teenager...
That sounds incredibly sad.
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA:Kurt Russell auditioned to play Flash Gordon. According to an interview with Russell in Starlog magazine from August 1981, Dino De Laurentiis really wanted Russell for the part, but he ultimately turned it down because Russell thought the character was lacking in personality.
00,10so tell me ponibas was the t-rex as fearsom as they say?

Freefall29: Alright, I'll try, I gave on on IE because it's sloww...... but your right, flash doesnt work right with Chrome
Actually I think it would be hard to tell.
That leads you to finding a shy girl who's tormented by older girls bullying her. To win her heart, you find the lead bully girl and choke her to death.
The standard for B Movies is still Strike Commando
Midnight_Fyre: me

'make love to me'
MrBen: yeah, from the right angle it looks like her.

Also setting Madoka aside from Eva is that Madoka puts the clock back together, only with the parts tuned up.
Amazing beard, I'm envious.

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Nicolas Roeg was originally going to direct, but didn't due to creative difference. One of his proposals was to excise the trademark cliffhangers and melodrama, seeing Flash as more of "a metaphysical messiah."

With Bokurano, there is no possibility of a complete happy ending

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Sam J. Jones' dark hair was bleached blonde for this role, and Melody Anderson's blonde hair was dyed brown. Flash was also supposed to have blue eyes, but Sam could not wear the contact lenses.
wait
DON'T SMASH THEM
Black sheep was fun
epic movie doesn't exist
Epic Movie was crap
lol on that second one
0,14and of course
Halloween 07 was crap
0,14Babes in Toyland
13don't deny it, epic movie is on par or worse than elfen lied in terms of the damage it does to your mind
really?
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Arnold Schwarzenegger was turned down for the lead role because of his impenetrable Austrian accent.
Cirque Du Soleil Approves this
13no not really
well maybe I can take it then
01,11ARNOLD!
That is why you fail
Its a Trap!
My mind is scarred by Epic Movie
But the type of damage it does is different
There we go
so is this that dark crystal movie?
otakon: haha yeah the sheep one was hilarious
You're in the jungle, Flash.... you gonna' diiiiiiie!
arnold schwarzenegger should have gotten the role
Woodbeast
Fluttershy would love this place
Nittany_Discord: ouch why
There's also Spider's Web
13elfen lied is... okay you know how in l4d2 when you melee kill a pile of zombies your screen is all covered in blood
13it's liket hat
Arnold was going to be Flash Gordon?! ....CONFOUND YOU HOLLYWOOOOOD!
Woolbeast!
Woodbeast... That name. -_-
Maybe, I hate melee in L4D.
they are pacifists
wow
Just stick your arm in the same hole he did.
So, I take it it's too late to suggest Resevoir Dogs as one of the movies?
so what is this exactly?
Spoiler alert = The wood beast is the physical manifestation of Sam Jones' acting
i can here arnold saying "i am flash gordon" right now
oooooooooooooooooooH THE JUNGLE! WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE IT I'LL BRING YOU TO YOUR shanananananaKNEES! KNEES!

Wasn't this parodiedon Drawn Together?
You gotta catch'em all
This can only end in death.

Screw the rules, I've got a mustache!
You used to be able to shove without fatigue.

01,11It's like Russian Roule-damn. Ninja'd
Metapod Roullete
Um, sir.... we forgot the beast. He's still napping off that kid he ate earlier....
13l4d2 ruined it
we all know that flash won't die
But they actually added that in before 2 came out.

ouch
Dat pain hole
bad acting
ZUUL MOTHERFUCKER ZUUL
Shizuka: why not make a mod that makes TF2 into L4D?
Too late, you didn't pray hard enough!
He's immune
PaladinDrakkenwolf: no I was quoting Drawn Together
On account of you could all crowd in a closet and spam melee and everything would drop.
He is FAKING
The Pyro would own at L4D, let's not kid ourselves.

Trolololololololololo............SNAP, FLASH! SNAP!

Would Resevoir Dogs be an A movie or a B movie?

Silverscreen: well you can't swing on a vine with one hand.
I swear they added it to campaign as well.
Flash Gordon

11,01Pleasure quicksand?
Rodents of unusual size? I don't believe they exist
Game Over
and sucked it
his white hair
He fell into a pit of wet concrete
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Most of Sam J. Jones's dialog was dubbed. This was down to the fact that Jones had had a falling out with producer Dino De Laurentiis over lack of payment and refused to go into the recording studio to loop his lines.
00,10and that's the second time he died
The End
Movie Over!
and his mouth was open
Shoo be doo Shoo Shoo Be Do
The faster you move, the faster you'll sink

I saved you so I can kill you
OM NOM NOM

Why didn't he just let him die?
dun dun dun
saved by the Hawkmen
Freud would have a field day with the imagery of this movie
11,01Fart ship!
variancies in rate of fire and recoil and damage per shot and even just the sights
Lexx
13i like that l4d1 has fewer guns, l4d2's differences mean the "gun that instakills at short range but is useless at long range" could also be extremely slow to reload or spreads so wide it's even useless at short range
DOHVAHKIIIN
What a Phalic ship...
it's my lucky day
desertman: he wanted to kill him himself
05not sure if penis ship of bugface ship
Wrek: I saw bug
bugpenis ship.
Welcome to Hawkmen's cave, motherfucker
I hear Hawkmen and I keep thinking of the comicbook Hawk Man.
Me too.
This guy is everywhere!
i didn't know dr doom was in this
he sleeps standing up?
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: All the main actors were signed for multiple films but the sequels were never made since the first movie didn't do as well as expected.
Hi!
Wrek: Penis ship with bug eyes
Dr Doom is Omniscient
I was not able to save my l4d sprays D:
Buffer
00,10it reclines when the door is closed
looks like a Pimped out Doctor Doom
Cloudsdale again!
13or the rapid fire gun useful for all ranges could be a heavy hitter with ridiculous spread or a nice balance of spread that does hardly any damage or a stupid three-burst thing that's useless in any situation outside sniping
oooooooooh
That city must have a massive fuel bill.
this scene! :3
Wait a schmuck.
Darf14 with C3PO golden armor
More like a budget Darth Vader
Is that Timothy Dalton?

Trial by Kombat

Brian Blessed.
He looks more like DR DOOM
TRIAL BY BRIAN BLESSED
13or the pistol that sounds like it's made from plastic, exchanged for the pistol that instakills but holds just over a fifth the ammo and fires and reloads stupid slow

Don't worry, Luna won't let that happen
Dude! You've known him for, like, an HOUR!

Sparta Kick HIM!
More guns is always better to me.

13that's why i always go with the standard assault rifle... i can snipe at range or spray and pray, i'm not locked into one type of fire
CriticKitten IT'S like the'yre rushing the cliches

CriticKitten Agree
Fatality
Woah.
SHIT SPIKES!?
I guess they've been. SPIKED

13which means you could be out of ammo for the AR you've been dominating the field with and now you're stuck with a three-burst thing that won't protect you when you inevitably get swarmed
LOL
CCCP YOU!!! :D
damn this is great
FINISH HIM
One of those spikes didn't retract
13the only time in the entirety of l4d2 you can choose from everything is the gun shop
CCCP: I see what you did there
Dark92Enigma: bA DUM TSSSS
YOU SCARRED HIS MODELING FACE!
This movie is awesome
Poorly is the answer.
Indiana Jones would have already won this fight

13you run dual pistols if you're sniping, crouch and stay slightly behind the pack as you move from choke to choke
spiky but fun

He's not dead yet
It's 1980 after all. The PG13 didn't come about 'till the second Indiana Jones movie.
