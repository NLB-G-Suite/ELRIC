There was a TARDIS sound effect somewhere in there

Did not like voice crack. 2/10
that wasnt really a voice crack
I don't get this....
Mining...for glass.
dat voice crack
i doubt that was a voice crack
This song upraged me for a reason, why Celestia didn't has her own song yet?
this is INCREDIBLY beautiful
shouldnt thw movie air ?
"Hocus Pocus"
also known as sand
cant tell if its supposed to be creepy or not
I...
that wasnt a voice crack, it was intentional
And then the children died...
this is INCREDIBLY.
/me fails to compute
HOLD ON IT'S PONIES AND WARRIOR CATS.
Hey all
04Because people hate Celestia and think she's a LOLTYRANT or some shit
No movie night?
This reminds me of the pied piper.
There's something strangely elegant about a well-done voice crack in a song.

You can't cut a torrent off at the source, because there are potentially thousands of seeders.
And trust me, the only thing that'll happen if a company finds a torrent is that they'll sent a Cease and Desist warning to the website hosting it, and that'll be it.
CRAB. BATTLE!

now hes gonn get beat do deth

He's screwed...
seriously, HOW did he get out of there?
Torrents are addresses guiding systems to link up and share data. You can't really monitor that.

Meh. That movie had little to nothing good to offer beyond cliches it probably wrote. xD But it really wasn't that good. 5 or 6 out of 10.
/me just came in the middle of the movie.......the visuals and the character design were interesting, but the voice acting was poor, there was unnecesary filler, and............i really need to look at it again before doing a full analysis........ This is the Angry Fanboy, signing off
Drive ssafe then! :)

SHIT SPIKES!?
I guess they've been. SPIKED
:D
13which means you could be out of ammo for the AR you've been dominating the field with and now you're stuck with a three-burst thing that won't protect you when you inevitably get swarmed
LOL
damn this is great
FINISH HIM
One of those spikes didn't retract
13the only time in the entirety of l4d2 you can choose from everything is the gun shop
I've always wondered how sniper rifles fit into the L4D gameplay style
YOU SCARRED HIS MODELING FACE!
This movie is awesome
Poorly is the answer.
Indiana Jones would have already won this fight
I mean, you can't effectively put down a swarm with a sniper.
damn
THE SPIKES DO NOTHING
could be worse, the platform might have flaming carnervous kittens
00,10quick give him a ball
AHHHHHHHHH
Savior of the universe!
THAT LINE
Well, that's a non-sequitor....
I would be scared shitless of them spikes
It's not bad in bottlenecks because it usually goes through a couple of zombies and it's a one hit kill
Only situation I could think of would be a tank, but you'd have to be a damn good sniper.
spiky but fun
