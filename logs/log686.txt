i prolly wont get ME3 till they drop origin
I can't believe they had Kal'Reegar die off screen
"You guys have 1 year to make this game"
NOW GET BACK TO WORK SLAVES
05making up as i go
How do people use sai like this? I can never get my lines straight.
Or to have that curvy look
lots of practice most likely
And maybe a tablet, i guess.
If I try to draw slow, my tablet makes wobbly lines. =I
I always use lots of lines then erase and clean them up
I don't like doing a lot of erasing cuz it takes away the smoothness.
yeah, that would drive me crazy
Cuz stroking quickly is the only method I've found to make smooth non-wobbly lines
i would never get anything done
yep
If you are looking for a tablet I recommend the Intous 5
LOL
I can't afford an Intuos. :<
That's why I have a Bamboo
I want an Intuos 4, because rubber tip...
I wish I had an Intuos
/me kisses Jmo's fish
the wacom works fine for the casual user
What's the difference between intuos 5 and 4 though? 4 is still more expensive around here
It's one digit higher.
:>
The Wacon Intuos
Wacom*
Wacon.
lol
hehe
That reminds me
https://images.4chan.org/vg/src/1349176131445.jpg
05hmm
Kerrigan
I'd say intuos 4 then, but I'm guessing there are newer ones that also have no touch
well ill see you mothertruckers later, going to go to school
Most of the time you can turn off the touch.
/me has the Cintiq24X on her list of "Things I'm definitely buying when I win the lottery"
Hehehe
I rest my hand all the time and havent had an issue
there is a sensor in the pen that the pad keeps track of
I don't use Sai
I use Photoshop
Are you cereal
<..<
I use Paint.net
cause its free
Only pros use MSPaint
:>
Paint.net isn't flexible enough for me. =/
I like sai, but there's no 'god skills' setting
I didn't like paint.net because none of my shortcuts working
tons of content packs out there to make it user friendly and add features
Hehe
Dat accidental link
Photoshop? Yeah
It's intended use gives it a hefty pricetag
Photoshop is one of the few things out of my price range.
I liked Painter 11 when I tried it
around..500 bucks
Elegant :3
I've decided to go with sai because i got it free from some /b/ronies.
Sai costs 70 bucks, buy it or don't use it
PIIRAATE~
Then again, I don't need that grade of software now adays~-
Alright guys, going to school, talk to you tonight.

<,<
dont hate me for it, but i realy like the taste of blood ._.
I don't think I have much to say here. :P
It is pleasing to many-
I don't like the fact that it is blood, but it doesn't taste bad
Belts, leather belts never--I did chew on it
FINALLY!!!
The tough leather felt good against ma teeth :/
but, leather tastes wonky, like blech
i didnt chew for the taste. Just the texture.
hey guys
hiya shocke

Well, welcome out of the hospital then!
Did you suck on battery acid?
i know...
A thing, less disgusting, we used to do, was run out into forest and get sourblades, and mix it with juice,, mmm
chewing on foil :3
Oooh I can't do that- teeth explode
i had pneumonia not battery acid.....:S
/me rolls out of this conversation
;3chewing on foil :3
hehe
My friends sister used to be obsessed with eating hair
and whiel we were playing games she'd creep up on me and nip some out and eat them
I used to be obsessed with eating ice.
/me is chewing on foil
I hear it's a very common thing.

11,02I had a dream that I met someone at the door...I too told him my name, but they wouldn't let me in...
11,02No, I only kid ><

11,02My dream was just weird -~-

11,02Don't remember it exactly though

The worst dreams, well, not WORST, are the ones where you buy something, or get something, and wake up totally disappointed that you no longer have it
05but i hope you'll enjoy any ways
I wouldn't agree.
/me strokes Jmo's face

I once fell asleep in group therapy- noone said a word when I woke up
Because a newspaper doesn't sell if it says that everything's alright.
Depends on the paper, some papers like to do happynews

Hi
how are you?
I keep forgetting I autojoin when I turn on this computer :P
HI
I'm alright, you?
Hi*
ello many peoples
same
hm?
>:l
You have an irc program?
yeah
which one?
I used to use a lot of other channels besides this one
icechat
ok
huh
I'll see if I can get it to work when I get home
05yay for playlsits
hey
The UI is kind of ugly until you customize it
05madness combat
Never would've though of that, I was thinking of something completely different.
Hey.
It's not Bieber
It's Miley Cyrus >:l
wubs
You'd know.
ROfl
she cleans them
with wubs
The only way to clean dishes
I kinda wanna find another irc I can go on when things are going slowly here
Theres a ton of em out there
do you just go through spyrochat.com?
well it seems
yeah
the dishes got wubbed clean
mibbit itself used to be a pretty good web-based client
But then it removed epic-chat from the list...
(im not good at that joke)
:/
why?
No one knows
it just disappeared one day
Theres no way to request it to be readded?
there might be
I guess he didn't bother for whatever reason
aww
05gotta turn autoplay off
heavykhin
seems legit
^
Could you email them or something?
20% cooler =D
I've heard this song too many times
My guess is Mibbit probably requires a certain size to be on their list
yeah maybe
Maybe we fell just below their threshold when they removed us
yeah haha
interesting
9 channels where people can actually talk
and I'll guess like 15 users total online right now
Because I don't think anyone can beatbox this
not everything at the same time ofc...
there's a disabled girl I know that could beatbox this
technically there are 11
but I didn't count the ones that aren't meant for people to talk in
probably
like #services and #bopm
I can eat cereal
well I guess if you count all the log channels there would be 14
and #staff-opers would make 15
http://derpy.me/okYqk
Yeah, it used to be quite a bit bigger
likely story
intertubes.
You mean.
oh ok
Dat Catgroove!
I think mibbit lets you do that...
guess it doesnt work on phones
08,01my little dried fruit: prunes are delicious
/me 08,01thinks he might be addicted to prunes
it might be some limitation of spyrochat.com/mibbit also
Saturn: mmm, dried prunes
Saturn: Prune juice is a warrior's drink.
08,01Mega_Milk: imagine a plum, but not gross
oh
Word
Saturn: But I liek plums....;^;
SR said in #epic-chat yesterday that he's surprised this server is still even up
Plums are the fruit of the gods
Because he stopped paying the bills like 8 months ago
^
Plums are not gross. D:<
08,01Mega_Milk: you be wrong in the head, son
05Saturn!
05check stream

oh wow
Saturn: http://fav.me/d5a752j
08,01oooooo
Oh you laughed. Don't deny
-_-
o.o
damn, that means this place could disappear anytime?
somuchumadwatdowit?
We need a backup server
thats kinda scary
Good idea
I have another irc server we can go to
Shit, gotta go, l8rs
Because I'd want to embarrass him.
Its not on any irc list
/me hopes it's not darchoods
no
We tried to merge with them once and it went pretty badly XD
What's on stream?
If we need some backup plan for the channel, I can work on that
I'm not watching
We could always talk to SR and see if he can change the spyrochat.com widget to point to a different network
Well gotta dash
Laters
Could leave a message here in the topic as wel
Saturn: plums are deliscious.....http://derpy.me/D2u42
Not sure
I don't really want to start making some other channel copy without him knowing
Oh we'd have to talk to him first for sure
Don't tell anyone I said this but he'd probaby flip out if we didn't :P
But then again I really don't want everyone to not know where to go
05PengWin: i knwo you are here! >:D
lol
We'll make sure everyone knows before we do i
Yeah
Isn't that the blonde chick from ATLANTIS? I'm back
but he'll probably have some network suggestions of his own
maybe
and we might have to remind him a couple hundred times before he actually changes spyrochat.com
ECHO!
haha
Woooooooooo!
We're mesmorized by Wrek's drawing. :3
:/
When we actually make the move
change the location
k
lol
o_O
05this is definetly one of my top techno songs
It should be fine
05enjoy!
yeah
I dont think it allows you to go somewhere else
/me bops head to music
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients
yeah I'll figure it out when I get home
we might not even need to move for sure though
maybe when we talk to SR he'll decide to start paying the bills again
or something
Or maybe he literally only meant one of the servers and the other two are still fine
/me Aprreciates the music
Not sure which ones he actually paid for
If hes on today, lets talk to him about it
yeah
You can't just make the channel?
Twas zoomed in earlier :)
maybe that's just epic-chat...
:<
Yap
admittedly I haven't been to many other networks
Point Being?
Nothing. Just that HE'S DRAWING HUMENS

Risking a BSoD
whats a BSoD?
00,10Yeah PS@ wont work on it.
00,10I think it just laughed at me too
Looking good again.
oh ... how can I not rekocnise a Phrase like BSOD because one letter was lower case >.<
I know :/
00,10short words in acronyms such as "to" "of" and "it" are not capotlised.
Whenever I type out acronyms, I only capitalize it like it were a title
00,10who said I care?
^
Well the fact that you bothered to explain it kind of implies.
00,10nah i just know it dont meen i use it
00,10one might say I could care less
yaeh dug!
I hate it, correct.
/me cetches some popcorn and a folding chair
00,10dis gonna be good
it's just that I hear it everywhere is it just generally wrong or is it just that you don't like it?
00,10exactly dari
The phrasing isn't wrong, but the meaning people think it has is.
00,10it's a phrase that is in a transisin
'I could care less' means that you care an unspecified amount.
I have to go to work for an hour
oh hi all :D
see you guys
cya
cya
They could care any amount, apart from not at all.
I don't get the saying either.
Because the phrase itself means they care somewhat.
wut
00,10I could care less, but that would require effort

he should have done the same like they did with robocop
00,10but he did't
We haven't decided a network
I dont have a problem putting money into it.
I wont just stop paying the bill lol
00,10so many quits
I guess that changes things a bit
but ill let you decide on stuff/
if you want to make that decision.
still, more people would be nice
Like I said, if this was a pony room it would be much more active. :P
hard to keep a dying francise active.
we actually do have #bronies still up :P
Have you seen darkSpyro lately?
this anime looks fun
It's thriving
full of kids and trolls, but still very alive
/me too busy watching stream
Those aren't netsplits
I havent seen anything spyro
00,10no they are not
brb
I don't even care about spyro much either, I just want the forum to stay alive
I posted a thread there, but I guess they don't appreciate my attempts to bring the spyro community together more
dont advertise spyroforum there lol
Yeah, the two forums have this really competitive mindset about each other
mention SF there and you're going to get burned
Just like if you mention darkSpyro on SF
If he feels more comfortable with the revolver, that's his weapon of choice.
Yeah I guess that does draw people in
I don't know why I even care anymore lol, I would just be sad to see Spyroforum die
I hate prosecutors
lol dat vote
yeah

Maybe next year.
Cool. PSO2 is coming out for Vita
Unless you founded a board purely based on Skylanders you wont get any Spyro activity lol
Oooof course
American release i can taste it
well we wouldn't want that
I personally have nothing against Skylanders, but I don't have much interest in playing it either
it's just focused on a different group
Yeah
Does he not have an electronic brain too?
which Idc that's business
crazy how angry people are getting about it though really...
00,10it works on the PSP but need to figure it out for vita
I dont know anything about it.
Ive seen it in walmart and thats it.
they're all like "how dare they ruin Spyro I hate them forever"
LOL
And I'm just like... how do you think I felt when TLoS came out?
XD
00,10but it's games list is realy limited
LoS could have worked had the developers actually given a shit
I still haven't played DotD
00,10but seeing as some developer leaked a ISO app for it
00,10so realy I can install just about any thing on it

"I killed a famous rapper. Then I found the other rappers that his fans liked and killed them too"
Not that I'd have anything to lose if I wiped my laptop, but still
lol
I ated a taco, then finds another taco and I ated that taco too.
ugh job interviews...
Why doesn't his mouth ever move?
I'm hoping I can just work from home and never have to do one of those again
not going to them.
Ill make sure i ask lots of awkward questions.
that dont relate to the job.
You're awful
I would hate you :P
NICE JOB
00,10dat brain reboot
previously he had called like 10 times
and wasted like 10 minutes for every call he made
with a fist
asking dumbass questions
thanks
and wanting to put different tires on his trailer and all this dumb shit
wait...
now he comes here today
and he stands for 2 hours with a tape measure measuring every little detail of this little $900 trailer he wants to buy
seriously, wasting my time
0.0
he did it wrong you need to kick him in the head twice
I should just tell him to go somewhere else
oops
I can sell like 10 $6k trailers in the time that he wastes my time
WORST CRIMINALS EVER
...Well...that was anti-climaxtic.
Oh yeah my job has 0 to do with computers or tech.
00,10it's only the start

And a spectacular start, too.
Send it in a non-iphone comaptible format
"Call me on my iPhone about the order you want to place"
"----Sent from my iPhone"
I always remove that dumb signature
LOL
alright I admit it I did buy an iphone
but the last thing I do is talk about it
He would probably call and be like "Umm, this doesn't work on my iPhone..."
YAAAAAY
Reset ZA WARUDO!
YESH
Trip to sugar ube corner :3
XD
cube*
he showed up and was all like, "oh those guys across the freeway have this trailer for $100 less and it has this and this and this"
"why dont you buy it then?"
and I walked away
Lolwat?
is the stream over?
Celestia, stop doing that to the stairs!
haha
good job
awwwww
I don't get those customers that try to match prices or whatever
DERPY <3
oh do I actually have to use the <insert nick> <>?
well the thing is I know my prices are the lowest
Why would you go into one store and complain that another store is selling it cheaper?
woooooh
D'aaaaaaaaaawwwwwww...

00,10pot80 "/nick newnamegoeshere"

ha
kind of
ahhh
its going to be a slow winter though
i think.
maybe ill sell a lot of enclosed trailers.
or maybe ill go broke. well see.
00,10so all you did was make a longer name....
derpy*
How did you ever get into selling trailers?
and I just kind of went with it
00,10but I like my current Vhost
we are years and years a head of everyone else.
well I thought people did this when they were afk or summing?
there is a limit
::p
00,10well you can,
00,10you dont have to though
I meant giving the "newnamegoeshere" nick. Registering it and giving it a self-depricating vhost.
http://laserpointerforums.com/f57/punked-thread-77828.html#post1119546
00,10Vhost are tied to the log in though
He doesnt like me either though
00,10so if I use the name it's gonna be my host
hahaha.
dont read the thread it was made by a nutcase.
I see.
I wasn't planning to :P
Glass eyes sees the problem with their crime plans
I remember you were talking to me on gmail one time and just kept saying shit about lasers
And you just ignored me and kept rambling
lol
That set up with tying Vhosts works in multiple ways.

Oh, RIGHT. The glass that he drank from
00,10they dusted the othere guys crotch for prints
also wtf is with hot topic and ponies
ha
I refuse to support hot topic financially.
See I don't get that
I'm not part of the hot topic culture or whatever
PHYSICS!
But I don't care if I give them money if I like one of their shirts or whatever
Have you been to a hot topic store?
Pretty sure they have a license for it anyway
Hot topic and welovefine make all the pony shirts
probably cafepress too.
:P
Yeah, I've been to them plenty of times
It just feels like a place things go to die.

Probably BLOOMER

Because that's the meaning of the name
Bouma, I think

/me writes down: ''October PAWNCH''
*nearby turret explodes*
#MindBlown

Wow. THat sucks.
Oh man, I can't watch this now.
Oh hey, its Eureka 7
Eureka 7?
Yep.
What's it about again?
Not sure.
I was told that its a awesome series but I must have tuned in for the wrong episodes
Hey all
2,14 it's as simple as that
But is it as awesome as TTGL?
/me ADVENTURE HO!!!!!!!!
2,14 they are two different animes
whos a ho
What's up?
2,14 with two completely different focuses
i know that
Dat snort
2,14 yes
Okay.
Does it suck?
JUst wanted to know.
2,14 my opinion on the matter would be bias
2,14 since I dislike english dubs
I don't mind English dubs, as long as they don't suck.
Its really whichever you hear first
Though Beebop did have some pretty awesome dubbing
ok thx
machine spirits? thats heresy. The emperor would not be pleased.
At the start he is
Yep. His transformation is actually pretty awesome as far as character development goes
/me bonks everyone
if gainax knows how to do one thing its make endings you remember
/me is wearing a mettaur helmet
darn
or the movie movies?
tv show
but you remember it
MISILES!!!

*^
shinji went full kamina/simon
You're talking about the rebirth series, right?
I doubt that statistic was compiled from any form of research. At least I can't see anything that says there was any research, just people spouting it as fact and not citing any sources.
yes. The remake movies
Rebuild
okay.
Rebuild
Whoops.
Dangit, I always get that wrong. :D
Can't wait for the last movie, though.
I can't wait for the 3rd one
THE AMITA DRIVE!! DUN DUN DUUUUN!!!!
NGE is pretty overrated though
though its hard to imagine how they'll top 2.0
Well i'm a sucker for unique takes on ideas
FAIL
That climax :D
Dat Fail
One Piece
!
/me dances with music
2,14 it's alright...
really fucking long series
I was going to suggest you stream Strong World. The 'movie'
screw the 4kids version of it
One Piece is my favorite series of all.
Its worth it though
Long, but still going strong.
poison suction cups :3
Loving every bit of it.
Its not really the same sort of shonen that naruto and bleach is, I doubt it'd have gotten very popular in the U.S.
Hello everypony! :)
Thought I was missing BMN....then i realized its Thursday :D
well the episodes stretch things out, reading the comics is more fun
hi
Everything I say is a lie
hi
See heres something else though when people talking on skype sometimes there messing around with something in the background
Shh, no spoils. but yes, that was pretty intense
the whole whitebeard war arc
NEVER
whats this?
Yes it did
IT DID
Whitebeard is the one character that I think is immune to rule 63
don't deny it :)
Because, just try and imagine a female whitebeard
you can't
Whitebeard's body repels estrogen
Er, the Void Slot
I do know that right handed tools can be dangerous for a lefty, particularly power tools, but I doubt there's any real data to support the claim that 2000+ lefties die from right handed tools a year.
but thats ponies
A male derpy? Hm, I haven't seen that
Also Whitebeard has best power ever
ive searched and not find
I'm both clumsy, and a lefty, and have used right handed tools before. I haven't died yet.
earthquake powers taken to hax extremes
One Piece?
It REALLY sucks that the One Piece games did terrible in the US. I loved Unlimited Adventure.
shhh
not eveyrone has religiously watched one piece
and I thought that was sort of weird
Alright. I'm getting out of this convo. I can't keep talking about it without spoiling
Okay.
Okay.
I'm just following the anime and he ... DANGIT!
read the comics
I hate Akainu.
He's a pretty neat villian though
He is.
once*
I can't decide whose the most hax though. probably Kizaru
I can sort of hear it
ding ding
dinners done
:)
Yeah Luffy's Japanese voice can get a little.........overexcited. :D
odd place to hug
AMITA DRIVVVVVVVVVVVU
Where is she?
EUREKA!!!!!!!1
>_>
<_<
Don't worry. Missiles have never killed anything in anime.
:D
Yep.
ROSE CRATOR

Guessing they're the enemies?
/me cant wait for xmas
Unit 1 has gone berserk
/me wants to get a WiiU
Too bad the Wii U won't play Gamecube games.

um
Not in NC
The gamecube is rediculously resiliant. I dropped mine down a flight of concrete stairs and it still works fine
A long time ago when the gamecube was first released

Hi guys :)
did optimus get uglier since the last movie?
or did that happen in this one?
zing!
Prime's kills in the third movie are pretty gruesome
That's how it works. In act 3, Optimus ends things in about 10 seconds. Also, surely you won't need those extra weapons and power later on.....OH WAIT
And that Super-transformer died after 10 minutes......making this scene: ENTIRELY POINTLESS
05,15Does it have explosions?
well they have to make room for his mobile weapons platform trailer
Good song incoming!
