the problem is that its BARELY above minimum wage which is not a livable expence here, the management sucks 90%. so basically you are overworked, and underpaid
lol
/me hugs SlurryMoon so tight because he hasn't seen Slurry forever
walmart is evil, the brony shirts are proof!!1!
himself, hahaha :D
I have worked at walmart, I have the right
These are actors, right?
Wait is SuperBrony streaming this? Inb4 he fires up Netflix and plays the South Park Wal-Mart ep afterwards
dat grammar
destroy the heart of the walmart
I think people need to calm down about the while brony thing.
that being said
*whole
they do provide cheap goods
eijei, pls, y u no humor
:3
AJIsAwesome: what happened?
We're attracting to much drama, and it's not giving us a very good reputtion.
/me hates walmart

It lies behind the plasma-screen TV's

/me hates Pinkies4thWall
AJIsAwesome: i was joking, i agree that bronies overreacted
03 This is Penn and teller
Evil smiley? :<

SlurryMoon! I havent seen you, in like... FOREVER
Whoever is streaming this,thank you
go away wallmart

03 They're showing about how bullshit Walmart hatred is. There's also a religion episode, but I'm kind of tired. SB can show it if he wants.
PETA, nothing; why the hell am I seeing similarities to WBC?
to put it this way
I need to get used to YTs new layout
thats bullshit
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Walmart had a bronys tshirt, but it was Generation 1. Bronies are overreacting to it.

minimum wage is 7 something
my store started at 8/hour for day shift, 9 for night

:S
49th ward, but the window said 48th ward?
Panda, /)
ASoftFluffyThing (\ for unknown reasons
Panda, your being offended to that word. I'm offended too. But here is neither the time nor the place
ASoftFluffyThing: agreed
I never found that word acceptable, IMO. But again, this isn't the place.
but SB, the "new" and "U" on your name... are they a reference to the "WiiU" or the "NewU" machine in borderlands that spawns you after you die?
11,02The word isn't acceptable in this chat. No need to discuss it.
Got it.
and SB, I have a panda you should see!
hey guys
hey
ASoftFluffyThing: Fruit: Grapes. Vegetable; Potatoes.
11,02Panda: My name was made before Borderlands 2 came out. I never even heard of them until you just brought it up. :)
how goes?
11,02Panda: O.O
tired, you?
What's this?
the newu machine was in the first one SB... I think...
Panda: aren't you an xbox player
>?
Cranberry_Scotch, penn and tellar: bullshit
I saw something on my recent Wal Mart about a Cashier Olympics. That would've been cool to see.
03 naw
03 Panda, Wii U was announced like 2 weeks before BL2 came out
Pinkies4thWall, I play evertyhing, even women... JK on the last one.
ASoftFluffyThing: hmmm i like MMMBananasfor fruit and between Corn on the cob
SlurryMoon, BL1 has been out for years...
03 release date of Wii U announced, I mean
man im pissed..
same
So whats going on?
why
So much yummy fruit and veggies everyone likes
why ?
Panda: Borderlands 2 on xbox?
03 oh, well, I haven't really been playing BL1 lately
Borderlands? What's that? :P
03 I forget, whatever, no it's about Wii U obviously
Only joking :$
Polydunami|reading: Best game to ever happen to me
but yeah, the NEWU machine was in BL 1
and omg!
Shizuka!!!

/me hugs Shizuka
hallo from new smartphone ..
Wuts wrong brony2447
/me loves cucumber, zucchini, watermelon, honeydew melon, grapes, pineapple, oranges, granny smith apples, apricot, and lettuce
13ikr
hey Shizuka
Ohai shizumobile
This is priceless.
13lul it doesn't understand colors
im pissed because i just spent 3 hours making my commentary 2 hours compressing and an hour uploading and it was too long. that Fu*king pissed me off
Shizuka, which client do you have?
13andchat atm
Shizuka: not smart enough for colours
they took my video down
aww
Hi Shizuka.
brony2447: wait what?! :O
over 10 hours down the drain
COmmantary for wut brony2447?
brony2447: which video?
:[
still working out this keyboard actually
super speedy cider squeezy 3000 commentary
what is your degree in?
Shizuka, also if you're using IRC on your phone, AndroIRC doesn't recognize color either. I don't think.
so im really pissed
Prediction isn't half bad though
Didn't use AndroIRC for long
brony2447: why was it taken down?
Wait, 3000?
DeathStar: cause apperently its "too long"
13so many new things for shizu to learn ><
I'm probably gonna go to bed soon
13brony2447: have them send you a text, that's pretty much all you need to be allowed 15+ minute videos
how long was it brony2447 ?
http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-papas-pancakeria/index.html
I am kinda of that thought
life is just one big lesson Shizuka
its the entier episode
13this is irssi Kandarihu :3
No non-image links during stream, please. :)
Shizuka, I see.
my fro is bigger than the sign
brony2447: too long?? wait for where?
NO! Shizuka is learning! NO! we all gonna die!
unless they have pony pics :3
Shizuka, AndChat takes a little getting used to.
13might try to figure out irssiproxy again
DeathStar: youtube
a) they do provide cheaper goods, which means more money to spend elsewhere. but my bias is based on experiences while working there
13may or may not be worthwhile
brony2447: but they have full movies on there! how long was it>
Bai from me now :
?*
DeathStar: like 23 min
lol
Shizumo.... dammit
"shizumobile"? :S
13i'm still here though :3
Seems you're getting the hang of it, Shizu. :)
ah alright
I've even seen videos exceeding 3 hours on Youtube
sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
but... I liked that there was double the Shizuka >.>
DeathStar: its just a episode commentary
Night, kirzstryfe. :)
It's a little nervwracking at times though
Heh that plug to their own DVD
brony2447: but... I'v seen videos on there that are over 24 hours long!
night, kirz. dream of ponies tonight :)
Night kirzstryfe
night kirzstryfe
night night kirzy-kun

I also shop at Wal-Mart every Sunday on the way back from church.
13emotes are kind of a pain on that keyboard >>
Night Kirz - oh well
DeathStar: i dont even know, im just pissed
Shizuka, what phone was it? O_o
QUERTY keyboard?
13htc one s
ah
I see
I like this guy's haircut :D
13never used a smartphone in my life so learning a lot :3
Shizuka, do you use the default keyboard?
13for the moment
Android?
Sooo, is this video pro- or anti- walmart?
man, does anypony wanna play some tf2 it makes me feel better
anti mostly
Pinkies4thWall, its anti walmart hatred :)
The weekend after last, mom and I took a look at Aldi's. The place was cramped, and I didn't see enough savings in what they had to justify everything else.
well, I didnt like the keyboard that came with it, so I installed an app that changes it. it may prove useful for you shizu XD
11,02Smartphones are awesome
^
Pinkies4thWall, it's pretty much pro-Walmart.
^
^^^^
13ja i see me liking this a lot :3
wish i had a smartphone :\
/me smiles
13will spend tomorrow figuring out how to load on music and such
man, does anypony wanna play some tf2 it makes me feel better (come on guys? plz?)
D:

Shizuka: what phone?
Shizuka, go crazy X3 You have the powerrrr!
/me wishes he had a cell phone

So Penn speaks and Teller never tells?
13OO

brony2447 Welll what all games do you play
13we are watching p&t bullshit?
The union angle. This is probably pivotal.
ok
13awesome :D
yesh
Shizuka, yes
NewSuperBronyU i feel sorry for me dad :<
i think I heard him say a total of 7 words... tops :)
Shizuka: Yeah on Wal-Mart no less (gee I wonder why...)

Arcane: all i have right now is tf2 and...*sigh* moonbase alpha

Or gadolinium, the 64th element :3
Pinkies4thWall: on xbox..i cant play xbox on weekdays tho
i remember when Nitt stream Moonbase :D
11,02Better?
the problem is
I heard a USB disconnection. That was over stream, right?
walmart DOES have unions
but NOT in the US
Kandarihu: Yep. :)
I remember when Shizuka streamed I-Fluid
i thought it was from my end
I-Fluid?
11,02Polydunami|reading: Antimony? o.o
Kandarihu: yeh it was
Antimony with the symbol Sb?
11,02Oh :3
thought my keyboard somehow disconnected. it could only use usb port rather than the conventional port >.<

NewSuperBronyU i feel sorry for me dad :<

Is there an episode of this about Agenda 21?

You sure?
You sure you want... PONIES?

IM NOT WATCHIN G4 AGAIN
No one ask for ponies >_>
lol
G3
Actually normally I wouldn't request Ponies, but they had their anniversary (Even though it's no longer the 10th)
<_<
Maybe show some FiM to celebrate the anniversary at least
*sits on his flank*
Dat personal atmosphere
Taking this argument to its logical conclusion?
11,02poniez? o.o
No Poneis >_>

How about Katawa Shoujo?

11,02'...look both ways across the street.' lolwut
Ponies on BronyState? <_<
Oh, hey! A Dollar Tree in the background
Yeah, that's kind of not safe for work, Kandarihu.
And besides, SuperBrony's one of the few mods to actually show random FiM eps (Though I haven't seen him do it recently)
SAW then? o.O
"i want to play a game"
what are these Ponies you speak of >_>
.....good point SB
Even though I SWEAR I saw breasts on this stream before
No ponies here. <_<

Yep no ponies on bronystate <_<
and then jigsaw gets glomped by pinkie pie after saying it
No ponirs at all <_<
but they spook easily
Polydunami|reading, it's more SFW than this. The only porn part is in the last chapter, and it can be automatically skipped.
Right
no cloppers either
<_<\
only human porn is acceptable :P
You're talking about Hanako's route, Kandarihu?
Kandarihu - depends on the route actually

NewSuperBronyU: lol probably
lol
Now, I know Lilly's route has three sex scenes.
o.o;;....
NewSuperBronyU, indeed. Computer illiteracy could be considered a disability. But forcing software vendors to cater to it would only make it worse.
Those stupid people need to park on the right spot >.>

Kandarihu - hence, Windows 8
Bah, I'd get kicked before I get into the fleshy details :P

Just general tiredness or a motive in particular brony2447?
MadSurge: i dont wanna get you beriddled in m emotions right now
anyone who claims to understand apache/php is lying
brony2447, "sleep is for the weak", take notice how weak can be used in both an insult and a way of describing that one is tired.
AdamTheDuck: and yes that kind of emotion
thanks for asking!
Damn my linguistic mind... I find myself analysing unncessary sentences.

Phase4: badass

MadSurge: Most of our "tv watching" happens on the internet. :P
Wait a minute what if valve made the game called ponies vs machines or is that already out?

Wrek: :O can't wait to see what else you draw!

BoroBrony, bad because now I'm going to neglect my homwork once again to watch Wrek draw :$
Yo

AdamTheDuck: Homework's for nerds anyway. (says the nerd)
ha ha :D nice AdamTheDuck

That drawing reminds me of an earlier image I posted

AdamTheDuck have you seen my little Dashie
Femspai?
Why of course BoroBrony
what did you think AdamTheDuck
Background Pony>My Little Dashie
That all the many tears were shed on that night I read it.
Calling it now, Wrek is drawind Applejack
*drawing
AdamTheDuck, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4648/
i read it last night and wow so heart touching
CrimsonPhoenix, oh you :P
AdamTheDuck, no seriously Background Pony is far more better
Haven't read Background Pony. :/ "Goodbye my Friend" is just as sad I think.
im here for a while
Huzzah
Ohai Bronysith
what is Wrek drawing now?
Bronysith I'd bet my bits on PS2 infiltrator? or something
I think it is one of the characters from a game he streamed yesterday
Seriously like each single chapter of Background Pony is thrice as sad as My little Dashie
hmm sailor moon pony...
oh god sailor moon
not only that but you learn something deep from each
that was my first anime
What about Sailor Moon Kerbal? :D http://fav.me/d5fbivg
Gold_Demona, that drawing is still ACE :D
lol XD
I've got half a mind to make more Sailor Scout drawings of that nature. :P

holy crap theres a lot of sailor moon ponys in google imsage search
my gosh all this pony art on /mlp/ is really quite good
Are there any sightings of clearly female Kerbals? If not, they're probably just kerbals with lipstick and big eyelashes :D
lol
MadSurge: I don't think there are any distinctly "female" kerbals. I took my best guess at mine. XP
I'll blame you for the fails I'm going to have for my end of year exam scores Wrek. Totally worth holding off my work. :D
Gold_Demona: well yeah, that's about as accurate as I expected :D
worth it,*
what? wreks doing something not boring? (checks stream) hmm nope still boring
RoboGerbil: y u no leik wrek stream?
Harsh
Not cool, dude :<
If you don't like it just mute and look to something else :(
anyone think the kerbles remind you of the minions from despicable me?
heh i just have a separate window for each, and yeh i just closed the stream window
05if you find me drawing boring then sure by all means jsut close the stream
DoctoDoctorWho: I thought they looked more like the Megaman Servbots :D

whats with chat and assholes lately?
Obligatory image: http://i.imgur.com/I7kfw.jpg
Bronysith: It's actually been kinda mild lately. =/
Gold_Demona: 2 days ago a guy was complaining cause val was streaming Final Fantasy 10
Who the hell could complain about that.
Dafuq.
At any rate I'm not seeing very many kicks/bans while I'm on
wasn't it something about the logic of breathing underwater?
actually nvm
I think i had a temp ban at one point
noone answer that
Gold_Demona, there was a ban a few hours ago, someone kept spamming >.>
flutterlove

lol, Like I said. While I'm on. Guess things get quiet when I'm on. XP
Wrek: how is Ze plushie?
i just found a /mlp/ thread that will cause the wrath of the viking god here
05just figured id practice soem human
05its meh ^_^
05as for the plushie
05eez awesoem
05she's having touble standing though xD
no comment on that one
what did you do with her? 0_0
jk
That's ok Wrek. I suck at humans too. :P
hey all
I have better luck with gargoyles, oddly enough. XP
Ohai Rommulus
Hiyo Rommulus
05one of her legs got a gap in the padding so the leg beds when applied weight to
05nd*
what are you drawing
did you buy the plushie or make it?
05practicing some human so im drawing an infiltrator
cuz you could slide a wire hanger into the legs for added support
05got it as a gift
cool
XD
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349939742313.png
not aloe
is this from a game?
DeadpoolDash|GW2, Planetside 2 I think
was curious cause ME3 has a class with the same name
and mass effect in general
who talks about ME3 anymore?
me
hmm thought EA messed that one up too bad
ME3 multiplayer is pretty fun
yes it is
i always seem to get matched with retards though
Ohgod im at the last episode of doctor who that has Rose in it :c
PC or console?
Want a tissue diddums?
XAX: rose was best assistant
RoboGerbil: Ikr ;_;
/me still like the ME series despite the shitty ending.
/me belatedly thanks Gold_Demona for llama
lol ^^
the ME series was great until they dropped the ball with ME3, I blame EA
Yeah
i prolly wont get ME3 till they drop origin
EA is always to blame
If you ignore the ending though, ME3 was an excellent game, IMO
I can't believe they had Kal'Reegar die off screen
EA is most likely the reason why the Ending to ME3 sucked
"You guys have 1 year to make this game"
"but sir it requires a minimum of 4" "I DONT WANT TO HEAR IT"
NOW GET BACK TO WORK SLAVES
05not from a game
05making up as i go
How do people use sai like this? I can never get my lines straight.
Or to have that curvy look
lots of practice most likely
And maybe a tablet, i guess.
that almost reminds me of a 40K model
Anyways, hey everyone.
In general I have a hard time getting smooth lines without making quick strokes
Hello oGriofa :P
If I try to draw slow, my tablet makes wobbly lines. =I
http://imgur.com/t7dhU Wrek
Gold_Demona: Do you use tablet or mouse?
Wibbly wobbly timey wimey lines~
oGriofa: Wacom Bamboo tablet
I always use lots of lines then erase and clean them up
I don't like doing a lot of erasing cuz it takes away the smoothness.
So I end up doing "quick stroke + undo" until I get the line I want
Gold_Demona: What would you suggest for a tablet, money isn't an isssue, I've been thinking about buying one, I'm good at freehand drawing so maybe i could do a tablet.
yeah, that would drive me crazy
Cuz stroking quickly is the only method I've found to make smooth non-wobbly lines
i would never get anything done
oGriofa: I honestly would recommend Wacom. I have pretty much the cheapest model they've got, so that might be most of my problem, but it's WAY the hell better than the cheapo-delux-brand tablet I was using before.
Gold_Demona: And how do those work, they just hook up to the computer right?
yep
If you are looking for a tablet I recommend the Intous 5
usb
LOL
oGriofa: Well yes, you can just plug it in and use it, but it works even better after you install the drivers. :P
I can't afford an Intuos. :<
That's why I have a Bamboo
I want an Intuos 4, because rubber tip...
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
I wish I had an Intuos
You and your rubber tip.
/me kisses Jmo's fish
the wacom works fine for the casual user
FUCKING HELL Phoenix Wright Is such a great game series
I want that rubber so bad! The tablet I have now is like drawing with a ballpoint pen
What's the difference between intuos 5 and 4 though? 4 is still more expensive around here
It's one digit higher.
:>
oGriofa: Yeah, if money's not an issue, then I'd say go with Intuos
The Wacon Intuos
Wacom*
Wacon.
New tablet brand.
lol
hehe
That reminds me
Wacom Knockoff brand from korea or something. :P
Demaa, when is new strip being made ;~;
No but Intuos5 has touch, right? But last time I saw it it was almost 200 dollars cheaper-
Jmo: As soon as I stop being distracted by Pok?mon White 2. XD
Poop.
Im going to cheak out some reveiws.
https://images.4chan.org/vg/src/1349176131445.jpg
oGriofa: It depends on what you get I think. Some have touch, and some don't I think. Personally I don't want one with touch.
05hmm
05who should i turn this sketch into
Hey Wrek. Do you know about a site called Pose Maniacs?
05and nope
Wrek, what's that girl from Starcraft?
Kerrigan
It's a really good site to practice the human form. LOTS of poses free to use as reference.
Gold_Demona: Im going for one that only lets you use the pen, my computer is already touchscreen, but its definatley not for drawing.
Wrek: posemaniacs.com in case you're interested.
oGriofa: what is your intended price range.
I'd say intuos 4 then, but I'm guessing there are newer ones that also have no touch
Rommulus: about 100 to 350, so im the range of good ones, i think thats reasonable from what ive seen.
Wrek: Zero suit samus XD
oGriofa: I'd say eyeball a few different models and look at their features. Typically if they don't say "touch" then they don't have it.
well ill see you mothertruckers later, going to go to school
Intuos 4 on kelkoo (price list in norway) XL costs 1000 dollars, dunno what a M or XL costs in other countries
Bye Bronysith
Gold_Demona: Yea, I like to rest my hand while I'm drawing, so id like one without it. :I
oGriofa: Same here
Most of the time you can turn off the touch.
/me has the Cintiq24X on her list of "Things I'm definitely buying when I win the lottery"
Hehehe
Gold_Demona: If i cant rest my hand i suck at drawing, I have muscle issues that make me shake.
Jmo: Typically though if there's a model that's exactly the same but without touch, it's cheaper
True, just saying though ;D
I rest my hand all the time and havent had an issue
there is a sensor in the pen that the pad keeps track of
Id have to ask a pro sai drawer about the settings they use to sketch and make fine art.
I have that mark on just under my wrists anyone who plays a sufficient amount of time on a PC
Ask Gold_Demona or Wrek.
Ask Wrek?
I don't use Sai
I use Photoshop
Are you cereal
<..<
I use Paint.net
cause its free
Only pros use MSPaint
:>
is wrek the one streaming, just making sure.
oGriofa Yep
Paint.net isn't flexible enough for me. =/
Yes Wrek is streaming
I like sai, but there's no 'god skills' setting
you have to download the user made stuff
god skills setting?
I didn't like paint.net because none of my shortcuts working
Vivix: God skills? :I sorry im new to this. Ive always drawn on paper.
You know, a lot of people look for that one setting in art program that makes their drawings instantly good
tons of content packs out there to make it user friendly and add features
Vivix: Never heard of that
Vivix: Oh i see, thats dirty.
Sai is pretty good on lines and souch out of the box, so to speak, but--settings overall are just preference, so I wouldn't advice asking anyone about anything but practical, like binary line vs not binary
Gold_Demona:Maybe because they want it a secret.
oGriofa: LOL maybe
Hehe
Dat accidental link
I cant justify spending $999.99 on a piece of software for what I would use it for
Photoshop? Yeah
It's intended use gives it a hefty pricetag
Photoshop is one of the few things out of my price range.
I liked Painter 11 when I tried it
around..500 bucks
05hows it looking so far? :|
but~~ I couldn't get the oils and such to work the way that I wanted, so the functions I were left with weren't better than Sai
Elegant :3
I've decided to go with sai because i got it free from some /b/ronies.
good so far wrek
Sai costs 70 bucks, buy it or don't use it
Lookin' good Wrek
oGriofa: Yeah... Photoshop is the only software I allow myself to pirate because the price is ridiculous
PIIRAATE~
Gold_Demona: Where do you even pirate that? I can never find it.
Gold_Demona: I guess ive never tried..
oGriofa: torrents
I used to pirate it, but the online part has kept me from doing that with the newer versions
ima buttpirate.
Jmo: No.
DeadpoolDash|GW2: That's why I never use the online part.
I stopped pirating the day I could afford things, still can't afford adobe software though
Oi I am what I wanna be.
Then again, I don't need that grade of software now adays~-
Alright guys, going to school, talk to you tonight.
laters
/me waves
Bye oGriofa
Bye Gold_Demona
I think the newest ones check with their master server to authenticate it
woops wrong person
Rommulus: I'm not leaving. O_o
bye oGriofa
DON'T LEAVE US Gold_Demona ;~;
The horror.
If I want to run Cubase 6, I have to put in a usb dongle that is authenticated online, like a key
Saw your post before I saw oGriofa's XD

Hello RaveBrony

/me helps AdamTheDuck with homework
Hey RaveBrony!

Ravebrony i heard you like raves
did someone said homework!?
:O
Yes Snow, good ol' slab of maths homework.
Ewwwww math homework
HOOOOOOOOMEWOOOORK! HOOOOOOOOOOOOOMEWOOOOOOOOOOOORK!
Ravebrony :D I have never been to a rave! Are they fun?
/me has also never been to a rave... or any dance club thing for that matter...
We're roleplaying
Ponies47, may I ask if you have tried one of these clubs out? I mean, a friend of mine is in an archery club, and that seemed very interesting.
/me clubs, but only with metalhead friends :D
the closest ive ever been to a rave was DDR :D
/me drinks lipton
/me drinks nestea
Adam, i want to do Archery, but i have a stress problem, so i'm homeschooled
AdamTheDuck: No I haven't. Nor do I want to. I see no point in after school activates so I don't do any of them.
archery is awsome
i do that and swordfighting
relieves stress so much =D
I also don't go watch the games for the football teams and such
I could care less about that
Me neither, I don't really like to spectate sport
Snow i can do all that with my ps3 :D
try doing it IRL
^
Snow, those are 2 things i've wanted to do since i was little
But yes, being active in it is fun.
Does the sword have a glowing pink ball on it? :D
I tried archery on a field trip i went on, i was the best there
ehm....no
:3 who wasn't here last night - any newcomers?
they are real steel swords
are they sharp?
kind of
Is this fencing you're talking about?
but we must be protected
Ravebrony thanks
With the foils and such?
no, not poking each other with stick-i mean fencing
lol
its not that
i mean real swords with real armour
its REALY heavy
Snow you're a knight? :O
basically, LARPING
if you say it that way
BEHOLD Snow! KNIGHT OF CELESTIA!
I've never heard of a school that taught ACTUAL sword fighting. That's interesting/ O_o
/me is a unicorn
a knight? ok....
:) Just for today, if anyone says they're new here, share this with them http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cG_PDCFncE - And tell me their reactions when I return :D
/me Doesn't like trying new things
May I ask why they're so concerned Ponies47? You do have friends at school right? (intended to be said in the kindest way possible :/ )
its not in school actually
BEHOLD Snow! UNICORN KNIGHT OF CELESTIA!
its after school
Snow: I count them as one and the same cuz you're learning it AT the school
I've given you all a little spark of madness, dont lose it :)
silly Jon Snow, go play with your wolf beyond the wall in the black
then yes, some schools teach that
Snow, if i could, i would duel you
YESH, I love Dumbo! :$
Cypresswolf, dat quote /)
AdamTheDuck: (\
I like to do that kind of stuff, i still have my old nerf swords xD
AdamTheDuck: No I don't have any friends IRL. I'm acting how Twilight did in the first episode but insted of books it's computer
the closest ive ever gotten to being a knight was playing with a broom stick :|
ofnai01: you can try, but im quite good at it
Cypresswolf: I love Pink Elephants On Parade! :D
vivix: yes, but not that unicorn
Cypresswolf: HA! :D
I must away - to delay further would be...well, madness :)
Aww.. but she's so cute
Vivix: Awww!
I wish i could go trick or treating
:(
Yay someone likes her

Wow. Saxton Hale says the scout is fast?
http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/b/b5/Saxton_Hale_killingsomeone05.wav
Scout probably felt awesome dieing to those fists.
I hear being Hale with only one Scout left is the eleventh layer of Hell.
Oh yeah?
especially if its a scout
Snow, where do you find the Dominated lines?
I heard it was being a midget, overweight, italian plumber who has to rescue a princess over and over and over and over....
Gunpowder, gelatine. Dynamite with a laser beam.
From a over sized fire breathing lizard.
Analogy for satan maybe?
You decide!
ofna01 at the same thing, but at the end of the page, there is voice command lines and responces
Barbetos: You have to admit, though, that Mario is very qualified.
Barbetos: http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/4/42/Saxton_Hale_killingspree02.wav
Qualified for everything.

http://tf2wiki.net/w/images/a/a6/Scout_specialcompleted03.wav
Kammerjunk well Mario is a masochist I am pretty sure. Hell the poor guy goes on vacation and STILL manages to rescue a princess.
From another midget no less
Oh yeah, he's definitely a masochist.
ahem scout?
http://tf2wiki.net/w/images/2/2e/Scout_domination13.wav
scout?
Yeah?
http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/c/c7/Spy_DominationScout06.wav
how much time have you spent playing scout?
I have over 150 hours on medic. So many PUG matches. <<
100+
I used to play Scout a lot.
out of my 350 hours
But then I found out just how fun the airblast is.
D:<
Kammerjunk air blast? Try flaring soldiers out of the air
I played with some crazy good puggers in my time.
My god.
I use the Degreaser, Detonator and Extinguisher.

I want to get that movie shown on here for a BMN
I have never seen it
RIP Shwiggan
Huh?
Shwiggan is a pretty cool guy.
He's not doing vids anymore as far as I know
His last one was a week ago
So that must be recent
Also, Charlie Chaplin is the man.
http://tf2wiki.net/w/images/d/dd/Scout_misc05.wav
Oh, I didn't even notice he made a new video.
/me stands up and claps loudly and whistles
at scout: http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/3/35/Soldier_taunts12.wav
So I got halfway through the Dictator video, but then YouTube was all "nope.avi" in my face.
Kammerjunk: youtube or Flash Player?
YouTube. The "Do you want to use your full name?" thing popped up and stopped the video.
never got that message
Kammerjunk: you mean like this? http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/b/bd/Engineer_no01.wav
nope.wav
Just so.
This is really random, so sorry. I find it funny that one of the pins on my CPU broke. I finally end up over clocking it and my computer is MORE stable than it was at stock.

I have never overclocked anything.
I hope Shwigzero never goes to machina. That would kill his awesome videos, like so many before it.
It would.
http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/2/2c/Engineer_negativevocalization12.wav
why dismissed?
Machina was great in the begining, but now its an oversaturated mess.

/me pats Vivix

wood is so damm tasty
You people are mental
Kids do weird stuff-

Wood taste is the bane of my pencils and the terror of drumstick
Charming topics :D
Nooo time for class :[

Later~
I dont like class!
I dunno, I kinda prefer that metal taste over wood.
Hehehe class
Suckers
Ugh, ill bbl, lol.
To be honest, I'm not even much for the wood taste.
I did suck on coins at some point, but Coppery always tasted weird to me
.____.
Really? I think metal tastes great.
/me was an adhd kid, that has to be said
Well some of it- I guess
/me flips table
Kammerjunk: go lick ironman
Something wrong, Jmo?
Y'all strange.

Sucking on coins, chewing on chairs/tables.

Chewing on sheep wool
ALLOFMYWAT.

A cartoooooon! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIrGgo1oo9c
According to my mom, and some memory of the taste, I ate cat food and said "Meow meow I'ma cat"
Iron does taste pretty good.
>__>
You scary browniestaet.
hehe
You got a say in this Gold_Demona?
On a some-related note, I love sucking on an open wound.
Love that metallic taste.
Jmo was a normal kid ;__; while I ate scissors and ran around pretending to be a dinosaur
says the person who slaps everyone with a trout >.>
Jmo: I stopped paying attention. o_o
;__;
What're we talking about?
They eat materials!
Well if the wound isn't too big, it's kinda soothing
Gold_Demona: Sucking on metal and wood and stuff.
Wood, metal, iron, wool!

I don't think I have much to say here. :P
/me walks in chat sees the phrase "Suck on wood" Walks out of chat...
It is pleasing to many-
Snow: Yeah, me too.
I don't like the fact that it is blood, but it doesn't taste bad
Mega_Milk: Welcome to! We're talking about sucking on and/or chewing materials!
Kammerjunk: -lol I used to chew on belts but that was about it.
Belts, leather belts never--I did chew on it
FINALLY!!!
The tough leather felt good against ma teeth :/

i didnt chew for the taste. Just the texture.

I used to be obsessed with eating ice.
/me is chewing on foil
I hear it's a very common thing.
11,02o3o
Suddenly, SB.
You wanna input something as well SB?
Everypny chew on SB!

/me chews on NewSuperBronyU
Schocke: Valedico!
Ice? Like just ou there winter ice?
11,02I had a bad dream and now I can't fall asleep again O~O
Vivix: No, like ice cubes.
/me is chewed on D:
oh yeah- yeah that is kinda nice
:3
Aww NewSuperBronyU poor thing
Walking out of the room, getting fresh information, or moving, is best aid against bad dream and going back to sleep
11,02Fresh information?
Yeah, like- talking to someone, reading something- listening to something
Just wire yourself up to the Internet.
Delicious information.
change your topic and yeah, current state of mind
whenever I have a bad dream or a bad day or any bad news comes my way. I drink milk :I
11,02O~O
/me noms on Mega_Milk
:3
11,02:3
05home now
Whenever I wake up from a bad dream, I'm kinda too lazy to get up.
05also
05i wonder if its a coincidence
I freak out from bad dreams, so I have to walk around or do something
05that i saw a police car drive on the road as i was biking home
<,<
Wipe the harddsk.
I'll just slap you silly veeveex.
Polisradio Wrek
harddisk*
05oh
hi everyone :)
05most of you lack context
Salve, Lil_B.
That man at your door?
05there was this random dude that knocked on the door before i left
Creepyguy
The hobo that wanted your plushie.
05he mumbled a name and a company and directly asked to come inside
The hobo with sheep hair
^
05i told him no and locked the door
05readying my axe
If they ain't invited, they ain't coming in.
Wrek: Smart man.
Ah yeah, I remember you mentioned him earlier Wrek
yeah
Suddenly Gold_Demona.
05but yeah
~shazam~
05police on the road downhill
Did I ninja you Jmo. :P
05i wonder if coincidence
Retro City Rampage is so awesome >.<
05so!
05still no stream?
You don't have police on twitter or policeradio?
Na, you've just been so uiet.
Till now.
Eenope.
05then i can continue
quiet*
05where i left of
(For some reason, police here has twitter, and put up random updates like that)
05untill sumi si ready to ps2
11,02I had a dream that I met someone at the door...I too told him my name, but they wouldn't let me in...
Was taht your nightmare?
Vivix: That doesn't sound very effective.
Well, it's just for small tidbits of info
the music that playes during the Biffman chase (Batman Parody) is a really really hidden 60's Batman Theme xD
11,02No, I only kid ><
Hehe
The worst nightmare I ever had was just a falling dream.
05gona continue on this drawing <3
heh. Stream literally picks up where it left off
All actualy police stuff go over their internal communication, but thigns like "Hey, the fire is out" or "Situation is fine, suspect apprehended" goes on twitter
I was drowning after beeing chased by a Rock
Russian knows someone here
I feel off a big tower of boxes and just kept falling forever.
?
11,02My dream was just weird -~-
fell*
11,02Don't remember it exactly though
I had a dream once, that I was looking at my own shadow, and it got more and more demony-
everytime I tried to wake up, it got worse ;__;
05i know its not ponies
The worst dreams, well, not WORST, are the ones where you buy something, or get something, and wake up totally disappointed that you no longer have it
05but i hope you'll enjoy any ways
I wouldn't agree.
/me strokes Jmo's face
A wise Wrek once told me. Too much pony killed the brony.
>.>
MAH FACE.
11,02Vivix: Wii U ;^;
I once dreamt I got a crybaby wah, ( I was 15) and I got up and looked for it
You dreamt about that? Ooh
11,02No o.o
The dreams I can't stand are the ones where your voice refuses to work, and if you actually put the effort to MAKE it work, you wake up actually saying it in real life.
Damn you're bad at the guessing game veeveex.
It's--the weirdest dreams- cause that tiny moment before you are fully awake, you're convinced you have it
I dreamt, I guess. I don't really know what.
11,02I did dream a few weeks ago about the Wii U though ><
Jmo I haven't slept for ...20 hours ;__;
11,02About having one
EXCUSES
Your own fault >.>
Ah yeah, that's what I meant to ask, I'm not good at speek today
;__;
11,02;~;
if i dream something that can realy happen that will happen to me
how2speek
NewSuperBronyU and than there are good dreams :)
/me hugs Jmo and cries
creepy
btw something is wrong with YouTube
Speak better good today!
05also
05on ym meetign
05we talked about bronies aswell
Gold_Demona: I have had that happen to me a loooong time ago when I was in highschool -lol I fell asleep at my desk and was trying to speak in my dream but couldnt so I tried and tried and eventually yelled and I actually yelled outloud and woke myself up and everyone looked at me -lol
05showed some of m y work
05she'd read about the min the newspaper
05(my job coach)
How'd it go Wrek?
I assume she had read something completely different than how it is.
Oh dreams where you are trying to do stuff is weeird- falling asleep in public is..emberassing enouh without jerking around mumbling stuff
I once fell asleep in group therapy- noone said a word when I woke up
Because a newspaper doesn't sell if it says that everything's alright.
Depends on the paper, some papers like to do happynews
where everything is super
naked drawing is naked
05it went well <3
I want to see a paper with only the text "HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY". No content, no pictures, just that.
Hehe
lol
Most of the brony stuff in Norwegian news I've seen have been positive
like inquisitive, misinformed, but happy
Kammerjunk: Just a headline and that's it?
Walmart and target ew
Yup.
lol XD
That'd be funny
11,02I go back sleepies -u-
Not even who wrote it, just the headline
Sleep well SB
suppi!
*glomples*

Sweet dreams, SB.

Sounds somewhat familiar.
hey
Hi
how are you?
I keep forgetting I autojoin when I turn on this computer :P
HI
I'm alright, you?
Hi*
ello many peoples
Hiyo Hoody|School
same
Damn it, I can't remember what it is from but I know that I've heard it quite a few times before.
HOLY CRAP PEOPLE
allo HoodyNinja
hm?
We're not people made out of crap nor are we holy.
>:l
You have an irc program?
yeah
DashWithRainbows: Technicality!
which one?
I used to use a lot of other channels besides this one
icechat
ok
No one ever knows what it is, but it works okay and it was the first one I found
so I'm used to it
00,10server are up now wrek
huh
I'll see if I can get it to work when I get home
05yay for playlsits
What was that song from then, Wrek?
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
hey
The UI is kind of ugly until you customize it
05madness combat
hii
Ah.
Never would've though of that, I was thinking of something completely different.
Go listen to your Bieber DWR.
Hey.
It's not Bieber
It's Miley Cyrus >:l
wubs
You'd know.
ROfl
she cleans them
with wubs
The only way to clean dishes
I kinda wanna find another irc I can go on when things are going slowly here
/me slaps Jmo with baseball bat
Oh man, I love this song when I'm hero on PF2
Theres a ton of em out there
do you just go through spyrochat.com?
well it seems
yeah
the dishes got wubbed clean
mibbit itself used to be a pretty good web-based client
But then it removed epic-chat from the list...
(im not good at that joke)
Still not as clean if SaxyJanitor done them.
:/
why?
No one knows
it just disappeared one day
Theres no way to request it to be readded?
there might be
I guess he didn't bother for whatever reason
aww
05gotta turn autoplay off
heavykhin
seems legit
^
Could you email them or something?
20% cooler =D
I've heard this song too many times
My guess is Mibbit probably requires a certain size to be on their list
and we're too small
yeah maybe
Maybe we fell just below their threshold when they removed us
Now we're way too small though XD
i found another brony at my college because of this song: he was beatboxing this
yeah haha
interesting
Was his name god?
9 channels where people can actually talk
and I'll guess like 15 users total online right now
Because I don't think anyone can beatbox this
not everything at the same time ofc...
epic chat is only 9 channels?
there's a disabled girl I know that could beatbox this
technically there are 11
but I didn't count the ones that aren't meant for people to talk in
probably
like #services and #bopm
I can eat cereal
I never realized is was that small haha
well I guess if you count all the log channels there would be 14
and #staff-opers would make 15
http://derpy.me/okYqk
Yeah, it used to be quite a bit bigger
likely story
if you do /list you can see all the channels that aren't private and how many people are in them
F*cking school internet
intertubes.
You mean.
oh ok
Dat Catgroove!
I think mibbit lets you do that...
inb4 my head full of derping pony heads
So bored ;_;
Ponies47|School: School buddies!
guess it doesnt work on phones
08,01my little dried fruit: prunes are delicious
Snow: more like a spinning sixties' Spiderman
/me 08,01thinks he might be addicted to prunes
Barbetos|AtWork , try putting in "YOUR MOTHER" to that guy in dewford town
it might be some limitation of spyrochat.com/mibbit also
it's been a while since I've used that so I can't remember what works and doesn't work
Hoody|School: School stinks. :<
08,01Mega_Milk: imagine a plum, but not gross
oh
prunes? eh, I would prefer white cranberry
Word
SR said in #epic-chat yesterday that he's surprised this server is still even up
Plums are the fruit of the gods
Because he stopped paying the bills like 8 months ago
^
Imagine plums but better
Plums are not gross. D:<
08,01Mega_Milk: you be wrong in the head, son
05check stream
08,01Wrek!
05drawing chicks
with dicks
ZING
oh wow
Barbetos|AtWork: -_-
08,01oooooo
Oh you laughed. Don't deny
08,01nice, wrek
-_-
o.o
damn, that means this place could disappear anytime?
somuchumadwatdowit?
Sounds that way :(
We need a backup server
thats kinda scary
This computer is quiet as hell...
I'm kind of nervous being on ponychat at school.
Ponies47|School: I have da volume at full
Good idea
I have another irc server we can go to
How come, Ponies47|School?
Shit, gotta go, l8rs
what server?
everyone, ping Hoody|School
I know the admin of the place too, I'm sure hed let me add a channel there
Because I'd want to embarrass him.
Have fun, Hoody|School.
Its not on any irc list
/me hopes it's not darchoods
no
We tried to merge with them once and it went pretty badly XD
looking amazing so far
What's on stream?
If we need some backup plan for the channel, I can work on that
I'm not watching
But I don't know how many here would be going to the new channel
Wrek be drawin'.
Ah
We could always talk to SR and see if he can change the spyrochat.com widget to point to a different network
then everyone who uses sc.com would just go there by default
Well gotta dash
Laters
Could leave a message here in the topic as wel
What would SR's thoughts be if we did that though?
Not sure
I don't really want to start making some other channel copy without him knowing
Oh we'd have to talk to him first for sure
Don't tell anyone I said this but he'd probaby flip out if we didn't :P
But then again I really don't want everyone to not know where to go
05PengWin: i knwo you are here! >:D
HAI WREK
lol
As soon as we get the ok on it ill start working on getting the new channel made in the other irc server
We'll make sure everyone knows before we do i
Yeah
Isn't that the blonde chick from ATLANTIS? I'm back
I would guess he probably wouldn't mind since it sounds like he doesn't really care about this network anymore
but he'll probably have some network suggestions of his own
maybe
and we might have to remind him a couple hundred times before he actually changes spyrochat.com
chat is quiet
ECHO!
haha
Woooooooooo!
We're mesmorized by Wrek's drawing. :3
:/
When we actually make the move
ill just have the new link on the topic and nothing else
huh what? i wasnt paying attention to the chat, too busy watching *drool*
So are we gonna change the location of this place, or keep it here and make a new one?
change the location
k
lol
Dis chat so silly :D
o_O
if anything goes wrong, just message me through spyroforum or youtube or something
05this is definetly one of my top techno songs
It should be fine
05enjoy!
Making new channels is pretty easy
But how are you going to get to the new irc channel?
Your using spyrochat.com right?
yeah
I dont think it allows you to go somewhere else
/me bops head to music
It doesn't; you'll have to get a client until sc.com gets changed
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients
I used to use chatzilla; I remember it being really quick to install and easy to use
yeah I'll figure it out when I get home
we might not even need to move for sure though
maybe when we talk to SR he'll decide to start paying the bills again
or something
05atleast Gold_Demona appreciates it ^_^
Or maybe he literally only meant one of the servers and the other two are still fine
Indeed I do. :3
/me Aprreciates the music
Not sure which ones he actually paid for
If hes on today, lets talk to him about it
yeah
O_O I just got on this and look what i get
I'm going to talk to the admin on the other irc server I go to and see if its ok to setup a channel there
what's wrong Pink3 ?
Wrek Bah, sorry mate, doing homework so I had to mute the stream.
Dat Virginia (you know what i mean) And by the way who is streaming?
You can't just make the channel?
DWR pls
Gold_Demona: I am ALWAYS mesmerized :D
Twas zoomed in earlier :)
I thought most IRC admins encouraged new channels
Joomay nu thanks
maybe that's just epic-chat...
:<
Is Wrek Streaming?
Yap
admittedly I haven't been to many other networks
I thougt so
Pink3: HE'S DRAWING HUMENS
Point Being?
Nothing. Just that HE'S DRAWING HUMENS
lol
Oomies.
Gold_Demona understands me :3c

Well the irc server I go to is sort of private
http://searchirc.com/
:{
the admin is a friend of mine and runs the place
Ah
I would rather ask him before I do anything
I'm sure he would give me the ok but id rather find out first
/me arranges the blocks
Play the Pewdiepie song

00,10and was useing the enmy tanks as cover for my tank
haha
I like Lady Gaga's music, personally.
00,10I watched 5 tankers locke them selves down with FF trying to kill me
ooh, let's move to iPocalypse
:P
05hehe
I dunno what that is haha
Gold_Demona: it's not too bad, and there's plenty of worst singers in pop music :D
Just one of the networks on the list that had a funny name
Yup

00,10I think it just laughed at me too
Looking good again.
oh ... how can I not rekocnise a Phrase like BSOD because one letter was lower case >.<
00,10it's supposed to be that way Lil_B
I know :/
00,10short words in acronyms such as "to" "of" and "it" are not capotlised.
Whenever I type out acronyms, I only capitalize it like it were a title
What Sumica said.
Since when do you care about writing things correctly Sumica? :P
00,10who said I care?
^
lul
Well the fact that you bothered to explain it kind of implies.
00,10nah i just know it dont meen i use it
00,10one might say I could care less
yaeh dug!
I hate it, correct.
/me cetches some popcorn and a folding chair
00,10dis gonna be good
it's just that I hear it everywhere is it just generally wrong or is it just that you don't like it?
00,10exactly dari
The phrasing isn't wrong, but the meaning people think it has is.
00,10it's a phrase that is in a transisin
'I could care less' means that you care an unspecified amount.
I have to go to work for an hour
00,10people are forceing the defenition to be changed via miss use
When what they mean to say it "I could not care less", in other words, they don't care at all.
oh hi all :D
see you guys
cya
cya
'I could care less' could mean anything EXCEPT what they intend it to mean.
They could care any amount, apart from not at all.
I don't get the saying either.
Because the phrase itself means they care somewhat.
wut
00,10I could care less, but that would require effort
I look at chat
ok :/ It messes with the heads of people who have to leartn the english language :/

Gah this Genesect I got in Black 2 is good and bad at the same tinme
*time
O.o
black 2?
Pokemon Black 2
I have White 2
Playing that right now
Oooo, Pokemon.
The OT for my genesect isnt "technically" mine
I stopped after emerald and such :(
So it counts as a traded, so unless I have badges it does what it feels like
Pokemon lost its appeal after Gen 3 for me
RaveBrony: Same.
I did too, but I picked it back up when HeartGold/SoulSilver came out
Exactly
ehh remakes
And I'm also nuzlocking gen4, which actually makes it more interesting to play.
Just isn't the same :<
Just gotta keep Genesect away from fire types
havent played past platinum
Got rid of the pervy old man? Do not want :D
Jmo: HeartGold isn't just a remake. It's an improvement
Jmo: Which is saying something cuz Gold was my top favorite before then
hm
Now HeartGold is my favorite
Fairo
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout

alexxm let's say Macho Man perfectioned it
The guy who played mario died right?
As a child, I can't begin to count how many times I tried to open a secret warp zone by plunging my bathtub drain.

Dken2021 wasn't that years after it had been said they were his kids
yeah dont take the pitch fork.....
There where did Jr come from?

Since when do Mario and Luigi plan anything?
yea pretty much
THey just wait around untill peach is in trouble.
Mario and the black knight :P
Bowser Jr is Bawser's only child. The other Koopa kids are just... well, random Koopa kids. :P
a Maccaroni minute....
In some cases Luigi waits for Mario to go missing or be in trouble instead.
How long is a macaroni minute?
Just to mix things up.
SpadeMagnes[School: Jr. came from Birdo.
00,10is it like minute rice Gold_Demona?
Gold_Demona, about hals an inch and 60 seconds ^^
how is this plan working
*half
I'm italian and I can calculate exactly how much a maccheroni minute is.
The eternal conumdrum is wether birdo is male or female
Invi: Oooooh, ok. That clears it right up. ^^
Sumica: Hmmmmm
SpadeMagnes[School: No. Birdo just is.
Hey
Wait. Are there actual other human beings in the mushroom kingdom? They happen to be roman?
wut?
and a maccheroni minute is almost 42 minutes and 7/9.
fight a three headed snake with swords => no chance against lions. wat?
Peach needs to invest in some security
Et tu, Mario?
dem lions
SpadeMagnes[School aren't mario and lugi the sercuity

Give the toads some AK47's or something
that toad voice
Get the castle fitted with cannons
few coins = enough to build a orpahnage
They're GOLD coins tho. :P
/me shows everyone a stone football
alexxm: And yet, Mario spends hundreds of coins on his drugs.
irl Luigi looked like my english teacher...
Look its a football!
the price conversion must be very high in that area

Freak out.
Wasnt mario modeled after a landlord or something?
Would it of been that much of a stretch just to build a set that actually allowed for them to walk by that window?
LOL Transylvania

XylemTube: accept challenge, play minesweeper
XylemTube: Restart explorer.exe
Why is a coffin in a plumbing buisness?
Halloween ep as requiested
I ordered a dead guy in a tux. Where is Meanwhile anyways?
How did who ever put it here, even get it inside?

Still banned?
Luigi looks like an alcoholic
Barbetos|AtWork: banned from what I hear.
Huh. I wonder who issued the ban
Not gonna point fingers
its probably for the best
Jmo: Hooves then
is Yoshi ever gonna show up
Wow. Meanwhile's still banned.
The not pointing of fingers that is, and probably the banishment
SpadeMagnes[School: He didnt ever show in this serires
needs more Yoshi
Mama Luigi
Applejack2012: He doesnt appear in this series.
Royal cow sells for a normal cow
Yoshi doesn't show up in this series until the Super Mario World season. This series takes place during Mario 2

Gold_Demona: Later kid.
00,10it's to hold extra clips Mega_Milk
05Mega_Milk: i prefer a gal with something to grab than skin and bones
:P
Wrek: IKR
So a woman with a spare tire?
Wrek: Your speaking my language sir.
would it be hard to move it?
05Gold_Demona: maybe
no
Nope, we'd just have to agree on a new network and make a new channel on it
Ok, later all
thing is if you don't feel pain you'll still get hurt you just wouldn't know it
...Oh, that son of a...
05right i was gona sleep
I have no problem with it, just remember telling me where to find it :)
this channel?
yeah
00,10it's no longer self defence if you reload
...This is getting good...it might not be so bad after all...
whats wrong with this network lol
its not like we get 1000 people in here
05Sumica: not even if all the first shots miss?
what did you decide?
00,10he put 12 round in to this guy wrek
Sumica: this is true
05i meant generally
05im not watchign stream
he should have done the same like they did with robocop
00,10if you miss yeah
We just thought since like you said the bills aren't being paid for the servers anymore it might be better to move somewhere more stable
00,10but he did't
We haven't decided a network
actually what happened was, the vps provider where this is hosted gave me a big credit for some downtime
Also this network is dead so it's not like it's doing us any favors to be here
so its been living off the credit.
I dont have a problem putting money into it.
ah, I see
I wont just stop paying the bill lol
00,10so many quits
I guess that changes things a bit
but ill let you decide on stuff/
if you want to make that decision.
still, more people would be nice
Like I said, if this was a pony room it would be much more active. :P
hard to keep a dying francise active.
we actually do have #bronies still up :P
00,10wonder if netsplit or bored chat.
Have you seen darkSpyro lately?
this anime looks fun
It's thriving
full of kids and trolls, but still very alive
/me too busy watching stream
Those aren't netsplits
I havent seen anything spyro
00,10no they are not
brb
Bronysith: I'm starting to grow into it...
I don't even care about spyro much either, I just want the forum to stay alive
I posted a thread there, but I guess they don't appreciate my attempts to bring the spyro community together more
00,10but often chat goes realy quiet when the server you are on splits from the rest of the network
dont advertise spyroforum there lol
So I've been trying to bring more activity into it
Yeah, the two forums have this really competitive mindset about each other
mention SF there and you're going to get burned
Just like if you mention darkSpyro on SF
the reason why darkspyro is active is because theres guides and stuff there.
If he feels more comfortable with the revolver, that's his weapon of choice.
Yeah I guess that does draw people in
Kandarihu: He's speaking with a lawyer. There gonna use EVERYTHING against you.
I don't know why I even care anymore lol, I would just be sad to see Spyroforum die
I hate prosecutors
Mega_Milk, I know.
lol dat vote
Hi, hello, howdy and what not
yeah
Hi pot80
needs more young people.
pot80: Sup.
to stay up all night and post useless dribble.
Mega_Milk not much
00,10I realy need to see if I can get video out to work on my vita
haha, you mean like us 6 years ago?
yes exactly.
00,10want to stream legend of dragoon
Sumica: 0_0
fun times
Sumica: dont wipe once on the first disk
00,10nice
my 3d printing forum is kind of getting popular
>mfw I forgot BanzaiCon was started today through Sunday
Sumica: would you be able to do that?
Maybe next year.
Cool. PSO2 is coming out for Vita
Unless you founded a board purely based on Skylanders you wont get any Spyro activity lol
i cant wait till PSO2 for PC
Oooof course
well we wouldn't want that
pulling the race car.
PSO2? I may never played the first or that one...but I love it from the aspect of the gameplay.
Bronysith, I've been playing the Japanese version, and it's pretty sweet. Gameguard spoils the experience, though.
I personally have nothing against Skylanders, but I don't have much interest in playing it either
Kandarihu: ill just wait till english version cause i dont feel like translating moon speak
it's just focused on a different group
Yeah
Does he not have an electronic brain too?
the franchise focused down on a different generation
00,10I would have to find a way to hack it so it can use the usb out as a video feed
which Idc that's business
crazy how angry people are getting about it though really...
00,10it works on the PSP but need to figure it out for vita
I dont know anything about it.
Ive seen it in walmart and thats it.
they're all like "how dare they ruin Spyro I hate them forever"
LOL
is the vita pretty good sumi?
Bronysith, I use an English patch so that most of the important text is English.
And I'm just like... how do you think I felt when TLoS came out?
00,10I like it so far
XD
well let's see they were ruining spyro anyways as it was so why beat a dead horse
00,10but it's games list is realy limited
Sumica: How does it play? Pretty smooth controls?
LoS could have worked had the developers actually given a shit
the last spyro game I played was a new beginning.
i just want a PSP for Final Fantasy Dissidia
I still haven't played DotD
00,10but seeing as some developer leaked a ISO app for it
unfortunately most developers these days don't care about overall content just meeting a deadline
00,10so realy I can install just about any thing on it
Bronysith: That is my favorite game on psp.
I'm thinking about buying it and a screen recorder and posting it on youtube for lolz
00,10yeah it's real smooth
00,10great screen

Alright. Time to switch computers

I can hear pling sounds and I don't know where they're coming from and it's scaring me.

Saluta, BaconMane.
Hi BaconMane.
guten tag BaconMane

Applelicious with Big mac is better ^^

Oh. I just realised the 'pling' sound is from Facebook. I just don't have enough friends to recognise the sound.
That sounded better in my head.
...Not what I expected...
/me noms on BaconMane
k
this music sounds like it could be in a video game Sumica
00,10indeed
But that pic is funny :P
Yeah. I guess there's no stopping the new PMVs from coming out. I'll just have to wait until my fast is over before I can watch them.
What are you fasting for?
00,10major, like a cyborg
mirrors edge anyone?
Kammerjunk, anything primarily MLP related. Mainly episodes, PMVs, and music.

Invi, Batou? Also cyborg.
What I missed?
0,5Nothin
0,5nothing at all
00,10batou and the major are both full cyborgs
In other words, the only natural parts of their bodies are their brains.
Holla everypony! :)
sup GilDash
Everything else is artificial
hi GilDash
i thought it was told that major actualy has a ful lcyber brain too
00,10guess togusa is more of a brunett
00,10they all have cyberbrains
Hi GilDash and BaconMane and MadSurge
ASoftFluffyThing: Holla! :)
it's all good lol
taoumi, cyborgs' brains are inside a uranium casing called a braincase. Combined, it's called a cyberbrain.
hai GilDashy ^^
So what's going on in the anime, despite that I know it takes place in 2032.
00,10I think you meen titanium
Invi: Holla! :)

Kandarihu: yes and i had thought major had switched cyberbrains and bodies severl times t othe poitn whe .... major had forgoten the origional body

*1:40 actually

AND NO ANSWER
00,10but yeah that's why the major is so good
00,10she's been one almost all her life
it's implied that she's the girl...but not told so
So why was this episode nothing but that?
back story MadSurge
MadSurge charachter building

There was a character? *shot*

00,10I get a bit of play in then it crashes out
Sumica: so is the Individual Eleven arc finished?
My heart just melted.

4/5 times i can't log in
alexxm: these guys are great animators
Sumica: so slow :(
i know Bronysith
It's a fan-animation. A damn good one at that.
and derpy has kamina shades
And asian pony
To save me from going through the whole conversation from this morning, what did Spryorocks say? :P
WOO it logged in

Sumica copycat :P
^
He said we could move it if we wanted to, it's up to us
Chrysalis: skype?
roselucks pissed
who wants to be a picture perfect pony?
ok
is someone here Facade7733?
But he hasn't actually stopped paying the bills
me ö.ö
00,10killerpony7733 is Chrysalis
Vordox: just wat i was thinking
oh
oh haha
Sumica I am what?
Scoot <3
Maybe that's why it's still here
Just hasn't had to for a while because there was some downtime and they gave him credit
hello :)
00,10you are Facade7733
ah
ekips: but I like swimming. And makeup is terrible with water
So eventually it will go down?
what?
Sumica I know haha.
He said he wouldn't stop paying them
ah right
Chrysalis I'm Facade7733 i PS2
00,10Chrysalis was asking who it was
IN
how are things DaringDerpy
In that case we dont have to make the move then
I guess I misunderstood yesterday lol
MadSurge you'll have magical water-proof makeup of course
can't complain, alexxm :)
ekips: and I'm a man :D
?
So, 3 episodes so far.
i wonder when theyll get proper flightstick implemented
MadSurge and?
:P
00,10I was gonna say MadSurge
MadSurge, that didn't keep the whole band Kiss away from makeup >.>
00,10wrek got his working Chrysalis
hi. did i miss any PEs?
/me looks for the log
*EP
just got in here
i cant help but think this song could be the intro to some Mecha game
Invi: true, but they weren't trying to be pretty :D
about 2 i think Dark_Horst
MadSurge, yes they were trying xP
00,10it would go great with an Armored core game Bronysith
Sumica oh yeah
i can get it to work
Can you only connect to one server at a time?
Sumica: THATS THE ONE
Sumica: I'll go the Major way and become a femcyborg :D
but theres so much more that could be fone
done*
No, you can do multiple
throttle control for one
what?
00,10yeah wrek maped his all out
So you thought he ment the irc server?
MEGA GAIZ
00,10has throdle and roll
Chatlog from yesterday that caused me to think the network was going to die at any minute :P
So what's this show about?
Sorry for the nick alert
huh
i can only get throttle up and down
not analogue control
magmablock: cyberpolice
asian matrix that sounds awesome
neat
00,10he did spind alot of time manualy maping it
00,10but it realy shows in his flight now
00,10would like to see hem try fighter now
00,10him*
doctor_whooves127 it sounds like a bollywood blockbuster :P
magmablock, it's a future in which cybernetic technology and advanced AI is blurring the line between human and machine.
yeah
supprisingly adding some deadzone REALLY helps with flight
I'm back......stupid hiking boots......
i shot someone down earler
Sounds interesting. I've always had an interest in that sort of thing
i was thinking more like china
btw, are you guys in PL tomorrow?
could be
lol
no worries
I was just making a joke really
I see
BTW, is anyone else here looking forward to Indie Games for Good?
dat Einstein hair
Chrysalis: so you up for some planetside2 after sumi is done streaming?
00,10would like to play some tomorow before movies
HE IS BRAINWASHED
GREAT JOB GUYS
7I like the idea that you exile people.
he everyone :)
Now that I think about it I haven't talked in #epic-chat in forever
Herro Lil_B :3
Kandarihu maby but big games developers can come up with exelent games once in a while
howdy Lil_B
what are we watching?
So it probably seems pretty creepy that I was just lurking and overheard all that
hi Lil_B
Lil_B: Ghost in the Shell
00,10ghost in the shell
hah
/me hugs MadSurge Sylandest and pot80 :)
yay free hugs
pot80, I'm talking about the IGG marathon. It's coming up on October 19th
I've heard the name, but never watched it, only the Movie Revie by the Sage
Spyro chat will live on :D
Sumica: so is this like a mystery anime or something?
Bronysith, this has it's fair share of action.
yay!
00,10scifi/ thriller/action
/me hugs Lil_B back
7You keep believing that
its over NINE THOUSAND!!!!!
IT'S OVER 90000
oh
aw, are you threatening them?
cute
what's oline?
7... I wasn't
Sumica: its strange the similarities my book has with this anime... AND I NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE
Kandarihu oh hope you don't mind if I ask what IGG marathon is (guessing something that everyone knows about but me XD)
7my point was that the chat has died before and it probably will again
Well it did slightly come back to life
00,10just wait, the big story starts becomeing more clear this ep
i dont know it either
pot80, Indie Games for Good. Are you familiar with Desert Bus for Hope?
oh
hive mind?
Kandarihu umm... nope
Guy had a small face
I still have NetworkStaff3
7hah bless them they still think SR is a god.
Whatever that entails I'm not exaclty sure
The crow was calling them names :D
But you got oper about the same time as me so you probably still do to
SR owned the servers
00,10and then things start to show them selves
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
00,10so all the crames they spoke of earlyer in the show these guys are the ones that did it
If we need to to upper-privilaged oper-y things
00,10crimes*
ok thanks that makes more sense now :)
like gline and such
hello
As you know
Sumica: so why are they doing all this?
00,10to insite a revolution
True fabian form. Heating up the world so that they can reshape the world to their own hearts' desire... those scoundrels.
I have root to the server so...
13ponies missed an opportunity for mica
I can always modify stuff.
But once I login things might not work anymore.
13or sumi rather.. i keep forgetting your pings..
Okay, at this point they're just comparing sizes :D
What do you mean?
like everything just goes down?
I dont really know what im doing.
"I did the biggest crime!" " NO, I did the biggest crime!"
Its a joke.
oh
har har har.
I assassinated the president,then brought him back to life and assassinated him again!
When I ran ubuntu on my laptop I accidentally formatted it one day. No joke.
^
wait what?
how?
00,10oh yeah well I huged a pony
I also ate his dog
I was trying to secure-erase a file
D:
but it accidentally the whole drive.
Sumica: Horee sheet your hardcore....
AGH, IDENTICAL WOMEN
His name was "Dog".
and ubuntu isnt forgiving it lets you mess shit up.
00,10robots
that's exactly why I'm scared of terminal stuff
I mean, it was a pretty dumbass move on my part
"I killed a famous rapper. Then I found the other rappers that his fans liked and killed them too"
00,10they handle the simple operations such as flying planes and security
Then why make them human? Just make them two arms and ahead
Flying a plane is simple?
Not that I'd have anything to lose if I wiped my laptop, but still
but its pretty funny to be able to say you accidentally formatted your computer.
lol
funny, but not good to say at a job interview or anything
00,10multy use MadSurge
I ated a taco, then finds another taco and I ated that taco too.
yeah that doesn't exactly happen everyday
ugh job interviews...
00,10that way they dont have to buy a whole new platform for diffrent uses
Why doesn't his mouth ever move?
Imma be giving the interviews
I'm hoping I can just work from home and never have to do one of those again
not going to them.
Ill make sure i ask lots of awkward questions.
that dont relate to the job.
00,10it's explamned later magmablock
how do you change your name? Do I have to log out and come back in?
You're awful
I would hate you :P
00,10use /nick pot80
I'm going to hazard a guess that he has some kind of radio in his brain or something
pot80, /nick <whatever>
You can change your name with /nick...what, do I have to demonstrate?
NICE JOB
OK so this nutter comes into my shop today
00,10dat brain reboot
previously he had called like 10 times
and wasted like 10 minutes for every call he made
with a fist
asking dumbass questions
thanks
and wanting to put different tires on his trailer and all this dumb shit
wait...
now he comes here today
and he stands for 2 hours with a tape measure measuring every little detail of this little $900 trailer he wants to buy
seriously, wasting my time
THE HELL
0.0
he did it wrong you need to kick him in the head twice
MadSurge, indeed
I should just tell him to go somewhere else
oops
I can sell like 10 $6k trailers in the time that he wastes my time
major artery
he's dead.
WORST CRIMINALS EVER
I like people who know what they want and are ready to buy, which is 90% of my customers
This one vendor won't shut up about his iPhone
...Well...that was anti-climaxtic.
Oh yeah my job has 0 to do with computers or tech.
00,10it's only the start
LOL
"I have the new product list, email me on my iPhone"
Yeah no point in ending a story were everyone just kills themselves lol
And a spectacular start, too.
Sumica: what start? They're DEAD
Send it in a non-iphone comaptible format
"Call me on my iPhone about the order you want to place"
00,10the guy in white did't die
"----Sent from my iPhone"
I always remove that dumb signature
LOL
Sumica: :O
MadSurge: There are more followers of the organization as well I would guess.
Sumica: I know, but he's ONE guy.
alright I admit it I did buy an iphone
but the last thing I do is talk about it
MadSurge, they totally screwed up the refugees before they did it first.
people always ask oh is that the new dumbshit phone, im like "yeah it sucks though."
and I start talking about what it cant do.
He would probably call and be like "Umm, this doesn't work on my iPhone..."
then they shut up.
YAAAAAY
Reset ZA WARUDO!
uhhh......?
I did fire one customer though a few days ago
YESH
Trip to sugar ube corner :3
XD
cube*
he showed up and was all like, "oh those guys across the freeway have this trailer for $100 less and it has this and this and this"
im like
"why dont you buy it then?"
and I walked away
Lolwat?
its so hard to watch this and not bust out laughing
is the stream over?
Celestia, stop doing that to the stairs!
haha
alexxm: Nope
good job
I should probably be ready to go into fast-mode every time Sumica finishes with an anime episode.
awwwww
I don't get those customers that try to match prices or whatever
DERPY <3
oh do I actually have to use the <insert nick> <>?
The next time I am all alone at work in the foundry. Im gonna do that -lol
well the thing is I know my prices are the lowest
Why would you go into one store and complain that another store is selling it cheaper?
woooooh
D'aaaaaaaaaawwwwwww...
<3
makes no sense
00,10pot80 "/nick newnamegoeshere"
everyone hates me because my stuff is priced so low
I actually got threats from my competitors.
Imma make em go broke.
hahaah
am i doing this right?
newnamegoeshere: Eeyup
Then once they are broke, imma raise my prices.
and have a moinopoly.
newnamegoeshere: yep!
00,10like i havent seen that joke 50 times
newnamegoeshere, yes. Next, change it to something sensible.
/me ekips
whoops
Looks like you got your shit sorted haha
00,10one of these days i am gonna nick lock that name
derpy appears
did it work now?
ha
kind of
ahhh
its going to be a slow winter though
i think.
maybe ill sell a lot of enclosed trailers.
sorry Sumica, I just couldn't resist
or maybe ill go broke. well see.
i'm sorry dery... but i wouldn't use your post
00,10so all you did was make a longer name....
derpy*
How did you ever get into selling trailers?
Or just register it and give it a silly vhost?
My dad and I started the business a year ago
and I just kind of went with it
I lied though, I use all my computery talents and stuff to make stuff more efficent
00,10but I like my current Vhost
we are years and years a head of everyone else.
well I thought people did this when they were afk or summing?
there is a limit
::p
00,10well you can,
00,10you dont have to though
Sumica: for some reason, this song gives me nostalgia of Zone of the Enders, probably it was a giant mech game
I meant giving the "newnamegoeshere" nick. Registering it and giving it a self-depricating vhost.
http://laserpointerforums.com/f57/punked-thread-77828.html#post1119546
00,10Vhost are tied to the log in though
He doesnt like me either though
00,10so if I use the name it's gonna be my host
because I almost made him go broke.
when I was selling laser stuff.
Sumica, I see.
hahaha.
dont read the thread it was made by a nutcase.
I see.
I wasn't planning to :P
Glass eyes sees the problem with their crime plans
I remember you were talking to me on gmail one time and just kept saying shit about lasers
And I was like "you know I have no idea what the hell you're talking about right?"
And you just ignored me and kept rambling
lol
That set up with tying Vhosts works in multiple ways.
so I'm going to do some h/w now bye
pot80_hw: later.
http://i.imgur.com/BGF65.jpg
DaringDerpy: already ordered :D
Doc be shipping himself with that guy.
00,10did he say rarity
<3
Id appreciate it more if he said Applejack
13>japanese not great a true to life faces
13>anime
send it to EQD "Possible Pony reference in Ghost in the Shell"
13i see what's happened here
00,10lol ekips
In that case, shouldn't most of the cyborgs have Big Eyes Small Mouth faces?
00,10I figured it all out
thats kind of what I do.
00,10Kuze, the white coat guy from the roof. is secretly tougsa
I mean, just look at my block of text above ^
00,10batou is gonna snap a neck
:D
Yeah I noticed
That means its a slow day.
made me feel like a moron sometimes though hah
00,10I can see him just grabing that guys head and poping it clean off his sholders
lip prints really?
so as usual, 50% ponies, 25% work, 25% helicopters
on the glass.
Oh, RIGHT. The glass that he drank from
00,10they dusted the othere guys crotch for prints
also wtf is with hot topic and ponies
ha
I refuse to support hot topic financially.
See I don't get that
pot80: put /nick (nickname)
what would the point of smokeing be w/ a prosthetic body?
I'm not part of the hot topic culture or whatever
PHYSICS!
what is up with that dude's eyes?
also, lawsuit from hasbro against hot topic for making pony toys in 3… 2… 1...
But I don't care if I give them money if I like one of their shirts or whatever
Have you been to a hot topic store?
Pretty sure they have a license for it anyway
They dont have them in canada, but i went to one in the usa
taoumi, his human brain can still be addicted to nicotine
Hot topic and welovefine make all the pony shirts
probably cafepress too.
:P
Yeah, I've been to them plenty of times
/me gangnam styles on [SWAG]DisplasedAcorn
I have a Pikachu shirt from there
oh god no
It just feels like a place things go to die.
00,10opppa!

[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn: you arent swag haku right?

/me stops starting
And ded

What is this..
00,10ghost in the shell

Bronysith: on YouTube*

a) our bbqs are better
MadSurge: ive seen the series several times myself :P
b) chillidogs suck
00,10would have to get english one
himself: no spoilers then :D
Chillidogs are delicious
i take extreme offense to that Chrysalis
Sumica: first season in on youtube officially
A. Because I would be surrounded by LIberals no matter where you go B. If any state is gonna collapse first it's gonna be California and C. I simply am not a westcoast guy :P
*in eng dub
That is a serious life goal -lol
MadSurge: you havent seen it?
It rains here 80% of the year
so........first ep?
Sumica: HOWD DID I GET UP HERE?

00,10you all want english?
chilidogs are the second best food
I don't know yet
Sumica: Im fine with whatever.
himself: I plan to see a ton of things, but then I get lazy
I think the english dub has been streamed here already
I would so prefer rain to the winters we get though
west coast society is dominated by many things I don't want to be part of
Fluttashy Rap :L

Sumica: you owe me one semesters worth of tuition
himself: really silly anime about a guy going to the titular school where everyone's nuts and a box robot is always mistaken for a human :D
those are the only states that are somewhat close to having a balanced budge lol
so we have to compromise somehow
owned
my evil senses are tingling
my dad wants me to move there
Chess is boring :s
MadSurge: lol, i think i saw an mlp crossover pic of that anime :D
MadSurge: idk, i find it fun, to play at least

I'm just weird that way I guess that I like hot weather
everyone here loves winter
I think they're crazy
I love winter
it's awesome
himself: first thing that happens, the guy drops a pencil, another guy picks it up and instead of giving it back bites off one end
See?
D:
Everyone!
wut
MadSurge: yeah i saw that bit on a site :D
I'm use to it
Maybe you'll see what I mean if you move to wisconsin
beein in it forever
himself: then picks a ton of other pencils and does the same in one bite :D
Everyone here hates the winter, except me :P
MadSurge: yeh:P

What's up?
2,14 with two completely different focuses
2,14 to say one is better than the other is ignorant of what they try to do
whose that voice actor? Sounds almost like Luffy
I am back with a rendering video
alexxm: That's an NC reference, from the nicktoons episode
i know that
Dat snort
giant surf boarding robots
yay more japanese animes
Caramel: Did they ever make an English dub of this?
chicks dig giant robots, its just a fact
2,14 yes
Okay.
Does it suck?
JUst wanted to know.
2,14 my opinion on the matter would be bias
2,14 since I dislike english dubs
I don't mind English dubs, as long as they don't suck.
best dubs are cowboy beebop and big O. And I say this knowing that they were on adult swim
i like the english dub better
Hi everypony! What are we watching?
Its really whichever you hear first
Hi, CrazyHippie! :)
Hi AJIsAwesome !
inb4 love interest
Though Beebop did have some pretty awesome dubbing
eureka seven ,it seems
chat is lacking pie
ok thx
/me tosses a pie into chat
at least that's what the blackscreen just read ^^
Well he's not whiney like shinji or simon so as a giant robot protag he's got some things going for him
TheMaster: HEY Simon is not whiny
machine spirits? thats heresy. The emperor would not be pleased.
At the start he is
TheMaster: he becomes more badass than anything else though, cause unlike shinji, he grows a pair
Yep. His transformation is actually pretty awesome as far as character development goes
he becomes a god
and yet he's still nobody ;-;. dat ending
/me bonks everyone
if gainax knows how to do one thing its make endings you remember
/me is wearing a mettaur helmet
TheMaster: that NGE ending was crap
darn
which one? tv show ending or the movie?
or the movie movies?
tv show
they ran out of money
but you remember it
and they were scraping the bottom of a barrel
MISILES!!!
the redo of NGE is amazing though
2.0's ending. Oh mahn
6
*^
shinji went full kamina/simon
TRANSFORMERS! THAT ROBOT ISN`T IN DISGUISE!
You're talking about the rebirth series, right?
I doubt that statistic was compiled from any form of research. At least I can't see anything that says there was any research, just people spouting it as fact and not citing any sources.
yes. The remake movies
Rebuild
okay.
Rebuild
Whoops.
Can't wait for the last movie, though.
I can't wait for the 3rd one
THE AMITA DRIVE!! DUN DUN DUUUUN!!!!
NGE is pretty overrated though
though its hard to imagine how they'll top 2.0
Well i'm a sucker for unique takes on ideas
Bronysith: True.
and NGE changed how giant robot animes worked
FAIL
That climax :D
Dat Fail
PWNIES!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Caramel do you like One Piece at all?
One Piece
!
/me dances with music
2,14 it's alright...
really fucking long series
I was going to suggest you stream Strong World. The 'movie'
well, the movie actually made by Oda
screw the 4kids version of it
sonicdude558: THAT NEVER HAPPENED
One Piece is my favorite series of all.
Kandarihu: it is really fucking long
Its worth it though
Long, but still going strong.
poison suction cups :3
relatively slow start, but once it gets going
Loving every bit of it.
right around the Arlong arc, then after that its just golden
Jigsaw vs Pinkie
Its not really the same sort of shonen that naruto and bleach is, I doubt it'd have gotten very popular in the U.S.
AJIsAwesome: i am more impressed by the 26 episodes of Gurren lagann more than every other episode of one piece
Hello everypony! :)
Thought I was missing BMN....then i realized its Thursday :D
well the episodes stretch things out, reading the comics is more fun
If someone dies, I doubt the first question that comes to mind is "was your loved one a lefty?"
Hiya Ponies47!
Bronysith: Well, that fine by me. That's your opinion, and I respect it. :)
hi
Everything I say is a lie
Hi bro Ponies47
though some pretty awesome one piece episodes are out there. The whole water 7 arc is in my top favorite parts of the series
Hi, Ponies47! :)
Sogeking is probably the greatest super hero to ever live
AJIsAwesome: dont get me wrong, its a good series, just incredibly drawn out
and we'll never know who he is
I just told you guys a paradox
how are things Ponies47
hi
See heres something else though when people talking on skype sometimes there messing around with something in the background
Bronysith: That's okay.
Ok alexxm. You?
TheMaster, the difference between... well, Bleachato... and One Piece is that One Piece is being planned out with an end in mind. The other series were being made without that.
i'm good Ponies47
AJIsAwesome: dat feel when luffy is seperated from his crew
Bronysith: Yep.
Bronysith, we should be careful not to spoil.
* | CCCP hugs aji
Shh, no spoils. but yes, that was pretty intense
Favorite ark has to be CP9 so far.
the whole whitebeard war arc
the 4kids dub never happened
NEVER
/me hugs CCCP back <3
whats this?
Yes it did
IT DID
Whitebeard is the one character that I think is immune to rule 63
don't deny it :)
TheMaster: :D
Because, just try and imagine a female whitebeard
you can't
The timeslot in which the 4Kids dub held might as well be the void timeslot.
Bronysith: what is the 4kids? I don't beleave that exists at all >_>
Whitebeard's body repels estrogen
Er, the Void Slot
I do know that right handed tools can be dangerous for a lefty, particularly power tools, but I doubt there's any real data to support the claim that 2000+ lefties die from right handed tools a year.
DeathStar: you got it right
TheMaster derpy hooves is immune.
but thats ponies
A male derpy? Hm, I haven't seen that
DeathStar, they made 8 episodes and they got the license taken away
Also Whitebeard has best power ever
ive searched and not find
I'm both clumsy, and a lefty, and have used right handed tools before. I haven't died yet.
earthquake powers taken to hax extremes
TheMaster: i like blackbeards power better
sonicdude558: no they didn't as they do not exist! ><
So any knowledge of what went on during that timeslot is strictly forbidden. Genocide of innocent people is preferable to public knowledge of that travesty.
One Piece?
It REALLY sucks that the One Piece games did terrible in the US. I loved Unlimited Adventure.
TheMaster: cause then he just friggin takes white beards
shhh
not eveyrone has religiously watched one piece
DAFUQ???!!!
Luffy knows Haki, right?
and I thought that was sort of weird
Alright. I'm getting out of this convo. I can't keep talking about it without spoiling
AJIsAwesome: ja
Okay.
Bronysith: Has he mastered it yet?
We'll have to see when he fights someone serious
Okay.
AJIsAwesome: idk
someone like akainu, who deserves several fists to the face
Thank god I can say Aloha Friday tomorrow
read the comics
I hate Akainu.
He's a pretty neat villian though
He is.
a non lazy admiral for ocne
once*
rawr
is the robot an AI?
I can't decide whose the most hax though. probably Kizaru
my god, this is Luffys VA isnt it Caramel ?
I thought so myself
howdy everypony how are y'all
I can sort of hear it
ding ding
dinners done
:)
Yeah Luffy's Japanese voice can get a little.........overexcited. :D
But its infectious. Luffy is best shonen protagonist
odd place to hug
Wipe your nose. :D
AMITA DRIVVVVVVVVVVVU
suddenly shiny sparkle sparkles
did somepony say Twilight Sparkle?
Luffy alone has tons of hilarious moments, usually shonen protags are serious and play the straightman
Where is she?
EUREKA!!!!!!!1
>_>
<_<
way to kill your robot Renton
Don't worry. Missiles have never killed anything in anime.
Petrified_Discord: are you sure
oh u Sweetie Belle
brb my dinner is ready
And the chat quiets down...
:D
Yep.
ROSE CRATOR
FISH
SKY

So what did he do?
I also would support a stream of wakfu
wakfu?
oh you mean dofus 2.0
odd quiet agsin
again
damn it ponies
Yes, the tv show is great
:'(
What is it, Bronysith?
no ponies
too much r34 art of ponies
AND I LIKE IT
must resist...MEOW!!!!!!!1
2,14 not in this chat Bronysith
ok
These aren't the pics you're looking for...
Move along now.
I like turtles :3
lowl
pony artists have some of the best pics ever, wrek knows how to draw really well
No one "lowl"s like Gaston!
i shall bury you alive aji
D:
indeed
Not even Gaston does anything like Gaston.
AJIsAwesome: that was for you
CREATURE CATS MEOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
No one gets bored and leaves the chat like Gaston
Bronysith: :P
So~.......

I don't know this one. :D
/me facepalm XD
Those guys look like they belong in a gundam show
I think we're good with just 3 notes
18 years old and I never knew this one by heart. :D
Petrified_Discord: fa a long long way to run~
petrified discord its facehoof
dynamo2814: What if he's not a pony?
dynamo2814: facetalon
hmmm true
Fa la la la....la la la~......
Renton, believe in me who believes in the surfboard
So, a needle pulling thread
we're done with that gag now, no more nazi musicals
Unless its the producers
la a not to follow so~
why can't we have nazi musicals
AH
Now I see how that crater was made.
it's NOT a nazi musical it's a musical containing nazis
Ti, a drink with jam and bread
Renton! Your surfobard will be the one to pierce the heavens!
surfboard*
and that would bring us back to do!
Just wait amu...
It will happen
do do do...
it looks like rainbowdash set off a nuke
i-is that? an A-T field? wait...still wrong anime
I'll just stay away from right handed power tools. XP
Guessing they're the enemies?
/me cant wait for xmas
Unit 1 has gone berserk
/me wants to get a WiiU
AJIsAwesome: A military in an anime? Nooooooooooooo
/me thinks he will use a WiiU more than a Wii
The video game industry is going to crash unfortunetely
Too bad the Wii U won't play Gamecube games.
no matter
I got a black gamecube from a garage sale :)
LUCKY! D:
um
black gamecubes are really common
Not in NC
The gamecube is rediculously resiliant. I dropped mine down a flight of concrete stairs and it still works fine
A long time ago when the gamecube was first released
Petrified_Discord: Same thing with the original Nintendo DS.
fact there NOTHING here
http://www.foddy.net/CLOP.html
2,14 petrified_discord: that's because there's not much in it
2,14 trololololo
And then I sold it in a garage sale :(
Caramel: o u :P
PeachStreak: Your URL is.......interesting. :S
My Gamecube is damaged. Whenever Controller 4 is sent a Rumble signal, it is suddenly dead.
i have a silver gamecube
I still think it's funny that there's been like 50 iterations of the DS and I've still got my Lite from the day it came out
Purple here. :P
My favorite pmv got taken off youtube
which made me sad
The malfunction really makes the MGStTS battles against Psycho Mantis a lot more frantic.
oh hey its Caramel s fav vid
Bronysith: Silver gc ftw
2,14 Derpy_hooves*
AJIsAwesome: a deceiving URL but pretty fun and challenging game
2,14 this is hardly my favorite video
PeachStreak: Ok.
I gotta beat him before he starts reading my input on the 3rd controller, or he becomes VERY frustrating to beat.

Eddmario: Sounds delicious.
Ooh, nice Eddmario

13oo veep debate... ryan is going to destroy biden so hard..
2,14 I'd offer to go longer, but my 3 hours is up
Austin: Don't hate people just because they don't like what you like.
Austin: Don't get your jimmes rustled there are tons of non-bronies you just gotta deal with it
Ryan FTW
hmmmm VP debate... not old enough to vote so FUCK IT :$
Is that debat on now?
Oh that's right! I'm 18 now. I can vote!

Doni have a right to if they call me and i qoute "you fag cock sucker. go drown in your pony orgies"
sorry for the language.
Please god let my vote count for Romney
I'm expecting Biden to come out swinging.
but thats what they said
Austin: That sounds more like a hater than a non brony.
13hm
13would anypony be crushed
Ponies47: DOn't say anything about it. I'd lke to see it for myself.
2,14 yes
13if i streamed bayformers 2 rifftrax
Ryan, for all his supposed qualifications, is usually pretty damn vague when you try and press him for details.
Shizuka: Nope.
AJIsAwesome: well, theyre still non bronies. and they suck
Ponies47 i saw it as well a bit too much hype for not a large payoff
Shizuka, nope
AJIsAwesome: I'm not going to spoil it silly.
13i mean the only transformers i ever see in the lottery list is for the G1 movie
13soooo...
Thanks, Ponies47.
Oh, the Thank You Project finally aired?
13imma do it
oh yeah and before i forget i may or may not have saved PixelKitties life by giving her a bag of cheexits
That was a brilliant way to spend $12,000, wasn't it?
Ponies47: did you jsut get on?
Let's not get on the whole "commercial" debate.
Last time it got a little out of hand.
Quick_Thinker: They coudl of done better. Did you get that poster they were giving away if you donated $15 to charity? You could only get it at the con
take care everypony. I'll be here for Movie Night tomorrow :)

Night Dken2021 sleep well :3
Shizuka: He did?
Shizuka he did?
bye Dken2021
and kind when they see ponies
Shizuka: He did? :O
13yes in fact, transformers was THAT bad
Dayum.
WOw.
Biden is actually extremely smart, experienced and just says whatever he feels like which leads to his gaffes
Is it bad I LIKE the song Linkin Park did for Transformers? :$
huh i've seen this piece of poo was it really so bad that i forgot the opening
This is the second one?
I've never seen this, is it as bad as eveyone says it is?
^ who cares if its the 1 2 3 4 they all suck
Ponies47: Is it bad that I liked the idea of a brony commercial despite the fact that we don't really need one?
13to note again, rifftrax has done the third bayformers but i don't have it
I hear he is good at debating. So I'm somewhat worried.
AJIsAwesome: I didn't say I liked the idea. I said it was meh
its sweet tooth
in the year 3490 robots rule the earth
Ponies47: I know. Just stating that I liked the idea.
So awesome the Transformers 2 riff
man i have to be honest the Hot Wheels movies i thought would suck but they are acutally pretty damn awesome (even has 2 MLP VA's)
hay guys
Gah had to refresh
countries pffft bs im not part of a country im a citizen of Earth
Hi, Rustymeat. :)
Who pinged before?
I did.
ive never seen this movie
Kandarihu: Ryan is a jackass. Anyone who idolizes Ayn Rand is a jackass.
One of the few good things about the movie: Peter Cullen
and compared to this they are the godfather of movies for cars
yay rifftrax transformers
Im a citizen of earth not a nation
"Crisco" :D
Shh, don't mention Ayn Rand. Paul says that he's rejected her now, even if he made most of his staffers read atlas shrugged
Which is kind of cruel
hi everypony
Ping? I heard a ping before? Who pinged me before?
The_Awesomeness: Good luck with that when you have to file your taxes or travel to another country.
Because its such a stupid book
Ponies47: I did.
NOOOOOO h tapped over his birthday party
bye
AJIsAwesome: You said? (Mah chat derped agian)
What were the ratings for this movie?
How did i forget this movie so much
5 minutes into movie, Michael Bay.
Yep :3
DocSane, they were saying that about Mitt Romney too.
this movie literally absorbs your brain, I don't remember any of this
transformers rifftrax? sweet :)
TheMaster: Every year at Passover, when we get to the reading of the 10 plagues, my uncle asks us to name any modern plagues. I usually go with the complete works of Ayn Rand.
13TheMaster: i've seen the riff for this probably six times.... hell i watched it the other day... i don't remember any of it either >>
AJIsAwesome the rating is watching this causes a full frontal lobotamy
AJIsAwesome: 5.9 on IMDB
5.9 WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
13that high o.o
I haven't seen one of these movies in a long time
Kandarihu: Spouting bullshit forcefully doesn't make one a good president. It just means he can lie convincingly.
Ponies47: I said "I know. Just saying that I liked the idea. Just that there was a lot of disagreement and hate on the idea of one."
wtf
21% on RT
twin jar jars, hah
CAUSE ONE JAR JAR WASNT BAD ENOUGH
TRANSFORMERS WITH COMMENTARY?! ME GUSTA!!! also hi
hi RDash5000
DocSane, he wasn't spouting baloney forcefully. He was speaking about reality.
13almost makes this bearable
AJIsAwesome: I didn't say I hate it either. You'll just see what you think when the time comes
Hi, RDash5000! :)
13i still can't stand twilight though
didnt like the room get a 2% on RT
Ponies47: Okay. :)
13i love how utterly pointless this entire scene is
yet i like the Room Birdemic and any other bad indie movies more then this
Kandarihu: No, he really wasn't. And I had to live with that fool as a governor. He lies as naturally as breathing.
im glad i joined :P
in that segment, Buddha is setting up the bomb
What was the point of the parachute? :S
13truck falls out of plane and turns into robot.... then immediately turns back into a truck on the ground... and then five seconds later is robot again
Cypresswolf: :D
dont get the problem. liked the movies. at least the first one. probably becasue transformers was never big in germany and i completely missed it
Shizuka: I was going to ask "The pony or the movie" but that has to be one of the most cliche jokes to make in this chat
Hey.
Hi, oGriofa. :)
13Dark_Horst: pretty much what mike just said here
sup oGriofa
Hey oGriofa
So, to everyone i was taling to ths morning, Im getting the wacom intuos 5
talking*
13the movies focus so much on the humans, who are just horrible actors all, and the transformers themselves are... also horrible
ohai oGriofa
man i want to know if Rifftrax is going to do Avengers (AMAZING MOVIE but would be funny to see)
DED

Shizuka: Is Peter Cullen's VAing terrible to you too?(Or maybe I'm just thinking he's good out of nostaliga of the old 80s cartoon)
13again? :3
Since this movie had terrible ratings, how did the third one receive?
my mom never gets that emotional
^
UGH
13J_E_Smith71: it's about what i'd expect from prime, though my canonical optimus is the beast wars optimus so :3

13today i learned that a smartphone is hard to hold compared to a flip phone... my fingers are all "i can't support this against my head ><"
Smith71 its so bad we are being more MATURE THEN THIS MOVIE that point in life where a movie makes you mature
This movies feel so sleezy to watch.
so far it seems like they're trying to make this movie as awkward as possible for families
13i... wow...
you know your movie sank an all time low to the bottom of the artic ocean right next to the titanic
13i just realized this is the first time i've actually paid attention to the dialogue here
Shizuka: It's not that hard. Once you get use to holding it :P
I CAN SEE EVERYTHING!
Shizuka: lol
ATTACK OF THE APPLIANCES
fuck this is so terrible
wtf
a dick cannon .. meh too mature for this 3yr old attention span movie
AJIsAwesome: Well the third one did *slightly* better, 6.9 on IMDB and 36% on RT
J_E_Smith71: Okay.
I truly despise this movie's theory that any damn machine can become a transformer.
night guys
Nighty night alexxm :)
Night, alexxm. ;)
*:)
good night, alexxm
hmmm i think i'll take thier theoy to a higher degree and ignore all the Twilights and the Transformers
this doesn't make any sense...
at least the third one is better.
Wait, why didn't he get here earlier? :S
is it sad when the rip off of your series (transmorphers) IS BETTER THEN THIS
Wasn't he in there in the first place? :S

There's a giant robot shooting missles in my front yard and my neighbors somehow never notice O_o
Cypresswolf: I know, right? :S
13if i remember right, lebeef admitted he haaaaated this movie, and i think the main reason it sucked so much was it was written during the writers strike
so even the actors hate it
Wow.
wow
man this movie is that fuckin bad
Shizuka: Oh God the writers striike
I'll bet that multi-million dollar paycheck was worth it none the less
I remeber that
so.... did they hire monkeys to write the script?
not the vacume :(
REJECTION
i mean im being honest i do like lebeef in certan movies but this ruined his acting carrer for life
Pointless clothes change is pointless? :S
how much did Labuff make for this movie?
three fiddy
transformers 2. aka a softcore porno with robots

p4ngya: Movie logic begs to differ.

DoctoDoctorWho: Yep.
WAIT......TRANSFORMERS 2?
DAFUQ BAY!?

FUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
13i think the only part of this entire movie i like is that tree throw, using a rock stock sound effect
Nittany_Discord: AHH that tickles
MICHAEL BAY APPRECIATES NATURE!!!
I'm back..........
pulse of the maggots
stupid hiking boots
hi Dark92Enigma
Welcome back, Dark92Enigma. :)
THIS MOVIE IS LIKE THE ENDING FOR ONE FLEW OVER THE COCOS NEST (hint its a sad ending to Jack Nichalson)
hi Dark92Enigma :)
2,14 why do I feel like I'm in a bastardized version of HL2: Ep 2?
sup Dark92Enigma
hu Dark92Enigma :)
as much as transformers is.....eeh it has the best kung-fu i have seen in a movie
Good thing I never bought any haha
RDash5000: NATURE GOOD! HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE!
Goddammit Michael Bay
look how much they move
No movie needs THAT MANY EXPLOSIONS.
MY GOD.
ASoftFluffyThing: Agreed.
taoumi: but kung fu panda!
This movie supports the natural wildlife for protecti-FUCK IT, LET'S DESTROY EVERYTHING WITH TWO GIANT ROBOTS!
Lets see who can figure out who's winning?
ASoftFluffyThing: moar dakka motherfucker
FALCON KICK
13i'm not even sure who's fighting
STOP SHOUTING HE DIES EVERY FUCKING MOVIE
This has just turned from Bayformers to Explosions: The Overkill Version
more explosions? no such thing.
Autobots, Y U NO HELP Optimus? :S
/me cachi01 I DIED FOR YOUR SINS
2,14 well obviously bots with color are good, and bots that are gray and lifeless like a CoD game are evil
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350005242982.jpg
man they are even making fun of the music
2,14 perhaps Michael Bay was making a metaphor for the gaming industry?
FATALITY
lol yep
thats a new one too
Shizuka. As Caramel says
SERIOUSLY, WHERE are the other Autobots?
13that's all it takes to kill optimus?
I remember that my friend though Prime was scary in these movie
13even optimus primal put up with more than that
Shizuka: I know right? :S
waht did it take it kill G1
Weak.
nothing can kill a prime except a prime or like 3 normal transformers
Caramel and the explosions mean how the gaming industry is slowly blowing into piece? :O
/me OPTIMUS PRIME: I DIED FOR YOUR SINS
I never liked optimus anyway.
waht did it take it kill G1
2,14 so now, if these robots are alive, does that mean PETA will protect them?
Shizuka: True
hey every pony
Caramel: ...Am I the only guy on the planet to like Call of Duty from the story's prespective?
I'm back! :3
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
hi rainbowvortex
13Caramel: humans are alive but peta doesn't care about us
yes VenHur
2,14 PETA cares about living non-humans
That's EXACTLY what I thought when I saw him die in this movie. HOW can he be killed SO easily? :S
all though the story is crap
2,14 Life is only precious if it isn't intelligent
WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU GUYS?
robots were always alive we are just to socially backwards to recognize our computers as synthetic lifeforms
The funny thing is, the store I went to had a game for $25 I think, and you could walk for literally 10 seconds to the store across from it and they had the same game for $5 haha
press X to Optimus
VenHur I don't mine the story I like parts of it
X
waht did it take it kill G1 Optimis
Shizuka i just realized you don't have a @ in your name
It would of been freaking hilarious if PETA gave the Bayformers trillogy a bad name.
but it's ok
13no i don't..
Their prices are pretty nuts
13the @ is the op flag
oh
i cantwatch this anymore guys, goonight.

Someone should kill the orange and the green robot...
http://static.fjcdn.com/gifs/Directed+by+Michael+Bay_cf942d_3305635.gif
nope, lets kill off good characters like Jazz and Ironhide
THAT PYRAMID'S A SPY
Caramel: have you seen this movie before?
2,14 nah
SPY
LOL
Silly Caramel, this is Transformers, not Power Rangers.
No
It's not a transformer
2,14 after the first transformers, I swore a blood pack to never watch another
Huh.
they wouldn't have given me much for them anyway I'm sure
Caramel: Oh hahaha, oh sure, the pyramid's a Transformer, let's see how Michael can pull THAT one off. Hahahahah.
I watched them to laugh with mah friends
Obsidian: well. grass explodes in both of them
Wow
2nd and 3rd ones were pretty good
RDash5000: i would but my headphones crashed
2,14 if I guessed that right, then Michael Bay is more predictable than I used to joke about
dark92
Caramel At least you didn't make a Pinkie Pie Promise
2,14 and that saddens me
And yet somehow you want to watch the sequel, why?
SUDDENLY LOGIC
2,14 hey, it's a rifftrax, it doesn't count :P
michael bay is a horrible hack that shouldn't get anymore money...ever
Caramel: The pyramid isn't a transformer.
2,14 my blood pact is still valid
Caramel: seems legit
jumping out of planes is fun
no, really

yes. those are thermal sights. they have the zoom built in
GAME OVER MAN, GAM---AlienWarhead said it first
Guy's screaming all like "I CAN'T TAKE IT! I DON'T WANT TO BE IN ANOTHER FUCKING MOVIE LIKE THIS!"
...I think I got it right.
that second scope there was completely superflpous
VenHur: i don't blame him
1 man alone
besides, thermal optics are huge
for every typo I've made - I blame this movie tenfold
Cypresswolf: This movie makes you lose IQ points.

yes
/me So we cut to people firing in the desert… And…firing in the desert… And then…FIRING IN THE DESERT!
2,14 >implying CoD isn't already a Michael Bay creation
He would replace the exploshions in the movie with rainbows and ponies.
RDash5000: thin to no plot, overload of special effects
lol
some how aliens would attack
The explosions, just.......
Because you know...war have those and shit.
/me tulio.gif
Dark_Horst: soooo, every michael bay movie ever made?

05,15Iron Man would make this so much better
RDash5000: yes.
iron man would have ended this already

Okay
And…firing in the desert… And then…FIRING IN THE DESERT! and MORE FIRING IN THE DESERT
05,15How could it be anything other than that?
However you gotta give it up for the CGI in this movie
I haven't seen it.
so, they're attacking a bunch of armored ground targets.... and no a-10s?
05,15Also, y'all have 5 minutes to finish your surveys
2,14 CGI in a Michael Bay movie is like Water in the Ocean. You expect it
surveys?
2,14 a lack of it would make people very concerned
Dark_Horst: i know right?
KILL THE RED AND GREEN BOTS DAMNIT
I didn't get the email.... Guess that's what I get for having 789 messages sitting in my inbox.

i mean, for fucks sae, their unit was especially founded to kill giant robots
AJIsAwesome: ...I meant a GOOD horror classic, and that's it NOT 3D.
you'd think the'd have armament that actually dos something
NOT YOU

05,15...............................

but i would give it to ryan
PEW
THE HELL?
and that was easy
WEAK
B1 time
2,14 well duh Shizu, he couldn't even kill the racist brothers
that was WEAK
which begs the question why they didnt fire that thing earlier
Shizuka, THANK YOU for telling me the name of trackmania
NOW SHOOT THE MACHINE
he presented himself much better than biden, and you'll agree when you watch it
So....reload>
Someone just get Conker to destroy him, he can kill him by smashing his robo-balls with cinder blocks

05,15POOOOOOOW
I don't really know anything about him
StinkomanFan: Sadly no
It was a pretty even debate
POW
HAHA
No, the other refference from that giant robot's you know whats.
Biden tried to be more aggressive but I think he came out way too smug
YOU ARE DEAD
AFTER EFFECTS AFTER EFFECTS AFTER EFFECTS
FIREEEEEE AND EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE
NOT BIG SUPRISE
as they put it
it looked like a cranky old man against a polite young man
i agree, he seemed very smug
And Michael Bay messes himself so bad it goes everywhere
i like how in the first movie two a-10s and a spectre couldnt kill scorponok and yet a bunch of bombs kill a whole troop of em
better than Obama looking down the whole time probably...
pump the blood out of his body
I don't think it will help them that much
We need to get the Mercs from TF2 to fight these giant robots
it will depend on the other two president debates
Dark_Horst: fuck logic
this beyatches aint got shit against a level 2 Hyperion loader robot
05,15It's not a Michael Bay movie without slow mo CHOPPAS
They're better at it than the army and the navy combined!

2,14 Robot Strip Mining, is that the transformers equivalent of cannibalism?
13just when you thought optimus prime couldn't be worse of a visual disaster
if they don't start presenting the true facts on that shit they're gonna be in for a world of hurt

Optimus prime died. lets save him with magic: the movie
:D
Smokin'
:D
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHASE HIM?!
WHY?!
/me LOLS
Hi guys :)
did optimus get uglier since the last movie?
hi Malmortius
or did that happen in this one?
Hi, Malmortius. :)
hi Malmortius :)
zing!
Prime's kills in the third movie are pretty gruesome
That's how it works. In act 3, Optimus ends things in about 10 seconds. Also, surely you won't need those extra weapons and power later on.....OH WAIT
hi Malmortius :)
and so Jetfire's sacrifice was easily forgotten
So, when are we watching MLP :)
And that Super-transformer died after 10 minutes......making this scene: ENTIRELY POINTLESS
Malmortius: tomorrow
Yeah just throw away your awesome armor upgrade Optimus
Malmortius tomorrow
They actually recently opened a new ride based off the Transformers films at Universal Studios
05,15Does it have explosions?
well they have to make room for his mobile weapons platform trailer
^ i can legally set this on fire
Aww come on, the armor was freaking awesome, IT EVEN COMED WITH WINGS GOD DAMN IT!
Good song incoming!
i am optimus prime
VenHur: and it was shed after what 3 mins
bun dun bun dun bun dun! bun dun.
7 minutes Bay, you can still kill the racist bots
transformers transform
AND ROLL OUT

Cypresswolf: YAAAAAY

05,15Sounds like Linkin Park to me

Sweetiebot is not as good a singer as Sweetiebell
fluttercry: Eeyup...
this is the best cover ever
OH GAWD SCOOTALOO FOR THE CREDITS
killerpony7733; Most LP songs are generally pretty good. Some are just whinier than others.
inb4 the Racist Robots are the heroes of the third movie :|
05,15Oh you mean someone is singing over it? I didn't notice
fluttercry Both transformers movies atleast the 1st and 2nd had songs made for em
Les watch Bayformers 3 riftrax!
fluttercry: Funny thing? LP sounds AWFUL live.
PMing yourself by accident how does that work? i just did it lol :D
05,15Not surprised
CriticKitten: ikr
Inb4 Michael Bay annouces a fourth movie.
CriticKitten Not too bad but i enjoyed the concert i was to
VenHur: NO
JUST NO
05,1521 Guns? I think you mean Telephone Line
The robot singing over these songs? He sounds pretty close to LP'
Live, anyways.
05,15Look it up. 21 Guns ripped off Telephone Line so hard
They're that bad.
Disembaudio needs to sing in every Rifftrax Credits
2,14 Michael Bay's Art School Senior project was a fastcam image of a nuclear mushroom cloud. He received an A for his excellence in cinematography
YAY SONGS IM NEVER GONNA HEAR!
VenHur: NO! PLEASE NO! He has milked a great franchise FAR ENOUGH
EEVVVEERRR
It really surprised me when I first heard them live, how bad it sounded.
CriticKitten: i like 'em. personal opinion i guess.
RDash5000: I like the band. They sound terrible live, is all.
Caramel, really?
The Transformers ride is pretty much the Spider-Man ride, if you've been on that
they are rebooting the Transformers movies by the way
2,14 rofl hell if I know. I was making a funny
/me 's ears explode
:D Karaoke Inferno!
Transformers was an amazing series, but then the Fire Nation attacked.
So I guess this is how Scootabot sounds
CriticKitten: never seen them live
Caramel, that would make a lot of sense if it was true
DeadpoolDash|GW2: how dafuq can you reboot something that is 5 years old?
05,15GOOOOD ENOUGGGGGH
2,14 god...this guy is almost as annoying as that idiot who screams the FiM songs
Yayyy lets watch MLP!
THIS IS IIIIIIITTTT
easy, with different people running it
Caramel: you mean Yaplap?
2,14 I dunno what his name is
Slen: THe drunk guy.
Stream something scary next
did i just see a request for ponies?
Caramel: yaplap
Caramel: solrac or yaplap
cachi01: I can answer that! It's called "The Amazing Spiderman"
Caramel: IT GETS annoying after a while, gotta admit
AJIsAwesome: is dat Yaplap?
carmel is he a orange pony
CriticKitten: oh yeah :D but hey it was good lol
I think you guys are thinking of the Drunk Guy who sings X.
05,15I don't know what you people are talking about. This sounds like these songs always sound
Spiderman, Spiderman, Your friendly neigborhood Spiderman
Caramel, you mean that drunk flim flam song?
I think his name is "Baconhair"?
Yaplap is amazing.
2,14 no, I'm talking about the guy who makes the songs like "At the F***** Gala"
Caramel: yeah, yaplap
ooooh
05,15I wish I could get popular on youtube by screaming into a mic
cachi01: Somewhat. It's somewhat better mostly because it beat the original trilogy, which is honestly worse than it seemed at the time.
Caramel: but Yaplap is awesome D:
the writing in the Transformers Prime series has way better writing then the movies
Yeah that's Yaplap
Ah, thnb that's Yaplap.
*then
05,15How is Yaplap awesome when all he does is scream songs?
Caramel: Oh the one who PUTS F-BOMBS in all of the song?
YAP
05,15Please explain
LAP
2,14 yes, so awesome that he screams his bowels out as an insult to a show with actual intelligence
SONGS*
fluttercry: because it was pretty damn funny
fluttercry: Because...screaming shit is awesome.
05,15I fail to see the humor in that
the first time that is
I know, right? *I* can scream songs. It'd sound about the same. *shrug*
ALL THE MILITARY
it's just funny for some
fluttercry I thought he was funny in Brony Reacts, but I never watched his videos
2,14 it's funny, fluttercry, in the same way that the Autobots Fart jokes in this movie was
personally I couldn't care less about those versions
fluttercry: I sung one of his songs at the talent show at my school :D
Yaplap is funny for some, not for others,
