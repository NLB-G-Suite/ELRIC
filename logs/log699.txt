Pikumen have wifi though.
/me shrugs ''never played Pikmin because my parents thought it would be too violent when it came out''

Funny because Nintendo admits they failed with the 3ds

With clinging lovingly to men on atvs

I am waiting.
Why are you not running?
Me?
Yes, you.
I am not afriad of ne thing
I guess that's going to change soon. :D
Except the possibility of no more pony.
That is the only thing that I am faid of
YEAH!!
SCREAMING!
So afraid, your 'a' has gone walkabouts.
JUST OPEN THE DOOR GRANDMA!!
The fed ex man is here

Well. I have a keyboard to install on a laptop
Be back later

Panda: Holla! :)

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: The Late Twilight Sparkle
Wow... four minutes and only a bot post? :S
:O
I know, right?
Hello GilDash :3
MadSurge: Holla! :)

Hello
/me sets Socks on fire

allo!
/me writhes on the floor in pain
11,01Hey Bronysith.
Moopy: Hmm... ceiling. I'd imagine the roof beyond that, and then there's the sky...
wha huh
Up is the opposite of down.
Astute observation there!
Anything you know is wrong, black is white, up is down and short is long
Oh I know, I am an astute observation machine.
But of course, no one makes astute observations like Gaston.
And a bloody sarcastic one at that. :p
well anyways sorry i left the chat last night i went to bed and i almost got caught but i didn't whew that was close
the little plastic tips on shoelaces are called aglets, they have pure sinister purpose
Sarcasm is great :)
Dken2021|Pokemon: What? You mean so you can actually tie your shoes?
The whores and the politicians will look up and shout "Save us!" and I'll whisper "I'm on rainbow road."
Can we get rid of the bankers too?
Nittany_Discord: so how are you today?
11,01I'm OK.
11,01Wishing I could run.
so im guessing wrek streaming right?
mmhmm
Nittany_Discord: your legs broken?
Nittany_Discord: Injury?
Sweet
The whores and the politicians will look up and shout "Save us!" and I'll whisper "No." Then the whore will turn to the politician and ask "What'd he say?"
i was feeling sick yesterday
Because really can you hear someone whispering from the top of a building when you're on the ground? Because I can't.
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350664531124.png
11,01GilDash: Maybe. Having foot pains. Been soaking my foot. It's helping.
ohai wrek stream
who is streaming and is this his fighting theme 4 real?
Chrysalis: get ur sexy plot on planetside 2 and skype call with us bro
her*
Oh shit.
Nittany_Discord: I've got my ankle acting up, but that's because I've been running too hard. Now my knee's acting up as well, and I've no idea why. -_-
i mean her
Meanwhile XD
Found lapiz lazuli, redstone, and gold
Bronysith Are you guys still in a call cause i'm not in it anymore. Had a quick shower before going into the game
Bronysith once im patched
11,01GilDash: Yeah. Irritates me since I want to get in shape. I'm still doing other exercises, but I don't get the same burn as with jogging.
killerpony7733: the call ended
This is why I need a new PC. :(
Chrysalis: okay
Bronysith Ah for what reason?
i don't know what was going on inside my stomach but i was barfing and i didn't feel any good so yeah
killerpony7733: Wrek is om nom nomming
Nittany_Discord: I've only really got running for now. Thinking about swimming and getting back into kettlebelling though.
The reason you're ill is because you've angered the lord.
Meanwhile: I'm the Lord in my own house, thank you.
And he has sent an angel to infest your digestive system until you repent.
Bronysith Well good timing i guess. So i'll have my hair dry in just a bit
Meanwhile: dont you be getting religious on us
Meanwhile: i thought you were smarter than that =_=
I'm sure no one will be offended by that sentence at all Sith.
Heh wrek getting back on the mic
Bronysith no call
Meanwhile: but someone might start something. then we would have to stop it
Chrysalis: cause Wrek is om nom nomming
kk
just signing in now
but i feel better anyways
You have been disconnected due to lack of faith.
Faith in what? Microsoft? XD
and what? let everyone wail on you while afk?
Praise be to Bill Gates. Amen.
hmm wrek still eatin for now then?
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350626568937.jpg
time to kill
05still logging in and all
Wrek: well the skype call is off
eeyup
So how many of you have accepted Bill Gates as your lord and saviour?
He's a good guy, but he's hardly my 'lord and saviour'.
I saw a rainbow yesterday and it was bright and awesome
Repent unto Gates and he will forgive your sins. And then he'll fix Windows.
Meanwhile: I don't believe that one damn bit. :P
Ikr? that was the most unbelievable part of this spiel.
05raptor jesus is my lord, sexual lobster is my prophet
I mean, how do you fix Windows? Honestly, even the most deluded would see through that. XD
Raptor Jesus I'm familiar with, but I've never heard of Sexual Lobster.
wrek has the best music
I think I've heard of sexual lobster once or twice.
simple, you get some glass, some metal, and some tools
Holy crap, I made a pun in that Windows joke and never even realised. :S
I can see through Windows.
So can I... I laugh at the Mac users on the other side. :D
What the hell?
ASoftFluffyThing|MC: quiet frankly, i dont know lol
Oh my god, water EVERYWHERE
There isn't water in hell.
not?
But there is in mineshafts
And I lost where I was going
It'd be quite interesting if hell was actually tepid.
That depends... what would you do whilst in hell?
Roast chicken.
watch infomercials for all eternity
Robot hell seems awesome
Dark_Horst<3
sup
Wasn't there a guy who proved that the hell is frozen? :D
Or you know, play a few rounds of poker with Robo Santa
Robot hell, hm?
it's like hell, but for robots
Are you sure it's not hell made out of robots?
*forget
O_O robot hell?
Infinite amounts of redstone, I guess?
Aye. Robot hell... the singularity in motion...
Panda, what now?
What would hell made of robots even look like?
Mechanical
robotical
But probably full of rusty robots
Who haven't gotten a nice dosage of WD40 in forever
geez it was a pain setting mirc
Wandering over the battered husks of Wall-E and a bomb disposal robot and the animatronic T-Rex from Jurrasic Park?
Invi, I dont like robots and if there are in hell... I'm gonna praise a god XD
hehe
Panda: but what if god is a robot
Nah...I don't think Wall-E would be in there
Panda, brace yourself, robots are coming the next few centuries :D
Now Jaws, maybe
Robots are already here.
twilight_sprinkle O_O no
that too
The singularity is in motion...
Invi NO!
I must be near a mineshaft. I see diamon and gold
ASoftFluffyThing|MC: and maybe the T-rex from Jurassic Park
Panda: your computer is a robot, ,just without hands or legs :P
BladedWings, or maybe the Jaws from Jaws 3D
wow
And Jaws 3D was and is a HORRIFIC mess
Robots aren't sapient yet though.
Hell, he shard didn't even look real
GilDash: or maybe thats what they want us to think
Anyone seen the trailer for the Jaws 4 movie?
Spielberg's shark was robotc yea but it didn't look it
The tagline is "This time, it's personal"
hey wrek this music is great i love it
Meanwhile: No and I don't think I want to, the movie is that horrific
this is a movie about a giant shark. "This time, it's personal."
I love the implication that somehow this massive fish is somehow looking for vengeance.
I think that's the one where the shark follows Brody's wife or something when she travels someplace
I don't know.
I only saw the NC review
Beware, if you wrong a shark it's descendants will hunt you down.
Panda, technically, a snack automat is already a robot
My name is Jaws Montoya, you killed my father. Prepare to die.
:D
Anything that works without a human directly controlling it and is programmed is pretty much a robot.
Meanwhile, they killed the baby shark AND the mother shark too
I was going to ask if anyone knew a good place to download the Remastered Dragon Ball Z episodes, but since we're not allowed to post links right now, I won't
9 hmm
Colour boot to the head.
Cranberry_Scotch: You can always get someome to PM the links to you.
True
Meanwhile: Mmm, tastes like lime...
ASoftFluffyThing|MC: then daddy shark is pissed :D
Fuck. Valuable redstone gone
for sharks family honour is a very important thing.
ASoftFluffyThing|MC: how is it just gone?
ah lasagne... fraking delicious
Mmm... lasagne...
It was directly over a large lava bed and it fell in
Got some of that in the freezer, actually.
oh...well that'll do it XD
ohai Eli
GilDash: it's better fresh :)
hi twilight_sprinkle
GilDash, what Eli said
Eli: It was fresh before I put it in there! :D
Could hardly let it go to waste though, could I?
/me slaps GilDash around a bit with a large trout
depends on if spinacjh was in there >.>
/me cuts Panda into two with a herring. Then makes a shrubbery.
Invi: no spinach ever touches my lasagne
Spinach? In my lasagne? Are you mad?!
ikr? there is a store which sells that stuff...
too late Wrek lol
spinach isn't even healthy
I like spinach.
Spinach is delicious
I can stand it, but I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan...
Makes for an awesome salad
my mum accidently bought it and I thought the lasagne would be scruffy
GilDash: Same here.
Invi: my mom somethimes puts it in hers... makes it more "italian"
Actually, I like practically no vegetables at all... now, FRUIT on the other hand!
GilDash you muffukka! you just killed an endangered animal!
hmm, spinich e?
*eh
Meanwhile: ever have spinach artichoke dip
No.
GilDash, fruits are sweet, vegetables not ^^
Panda: Umm... hang on a sec...
GilDash: i like some vegetables. but yeah fruits are better
/me sows Panda back together.
sews.
Panda: All good? ^_^;
fruit ftw
Meanwhile: Knew I'd spelt that wrong. Thanks SpellCheck! ^_^
Np.
Meanwhile: Do you still bother with colour at all? XD
now excuse me while i go downstairs and get me another serving of lasagne
Meanwhile is best spell check
^
Eli: Lucky git...
Can I ask for 10 seconds of silence. Something awful has happened. Big Tex, the Texas State Fair mascot, went up in flames, and is now gone.
Meanwhile: oh shit, thats ur cutie mark
RIP Big Tex.
=((
GilDash: No, I've just pretty much accepted that an entire nation was raised to spell it wrong.
Thanks gusy
=P
Barbetos: Crap, that sucks.
Meanwhile: I know... such a shame, isn't it? And just think, we almost had them...
i dont remember if it was a fruit or vegetable, but a while ago i remember seeing on discovery science, a show where they were talking about a food that can taste like anything that is your favorite food, somehow related to yer brain
GilDash: Why would we want them.
wb [Alpha]
twilight_sprinkle interesting
last time I try that
Meanwhile: ... Manual labour?
twilight_sprinkle: i would like to see this food
[Alpha], try what?
GilDash: Eh, maybe.
I'm just ripping music from Spyro 2 and there are also speeches in all the languages and the deutsch sounds so funny :D I think I'll play the game in deutsch
Meanwhile: I would suggest cannon fodder, but we don't need any more friendly fire. :D
twilight_sprinkle, how would it taste if you have no favourite food?
Hahaha
10 mins of ps2!
Invi: like nothing i assume
right now, i don't need my favourite food. lasagne is close enough
GilDash: wow :\
BladedWings, or everything at once?
Invi: i think that would be overload lol
Eli: whats your favorite food?
twilight_sprinkle: It's a joke... :p
twilight_sprinkle: i don't think anything can copy a good chicken curry
Invi: perhaps depending on somethingyou crave or need
using colred text in mirc
twilight_sprinkle: Oh gods yes...
Good evening
ohai MecidTheGermanBrony
evening MecidTheGermanBrony
twilight_sprinkle: Sorry, that was for Eli, not you. XD
Hi, MecidTheGermanBrony. :)
Eli: but the way it works, i think, is that your brain copies it, so it can i believe. although i dont know or remember much about that
/me eats donut
[Alpha], yeah. apparently you haven't read the rules ^^
Yeah, coloured text is an auto-kick.
twilight_sprinkle: the texture still wouldn't work
beep beep im a cloud
meow, i am a dog
Woof, I'm a crocodile.
Moo, I'm a fish.
Eli: but youve tasted it before, and youre eating something, so perhaps the brain could replicate the taste by memory
baaaa, i'm a girraffe
Eli: it probably doesnt work perfectly of course
AJIsAwesome|MK7: whats mk7?
Mario Kart 7. :3
Squeek, I'm a butterfly
I prefer to discover the rules. Makes it interesting but I already have at least some common courtesy when it comes to chat due to prior knowledge
ah k
twilight_sprinkle, what stuff would taste like that?
Caww, I'm a mouse
[Alpha]: heh same
twilight_sprinkle: i don't think i have that good of a memory. which is good. everytime i taste chicken curry it's like a whole new dish
*what stuff was it?
Invi: what mean do u
twilight_sprinkle, that stuff that tastes like favourite food
afternoon all :)
hai Ryunosuke
ohai Ryunosuke
Hi, Ryunosuke. :)
Invi: its own taste? idk, im not sure that can be easily determined if it tastes like anything
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH
hoi Ryunosuke
that's what i think of CSI miami
and what is that foof of all foods called?
*food
well hmm
Food Squared?
I *love* chicken curry. My favourite's a dipiaza at the moment.
Invi: i dont remember, i saw it on discovery several years ago
*Dopiaza
patches \
patching all day every day :)
Shrimp Pasta, possibly my favorite dish ever
twilight_sprinkle, aw, then i'll ask the allmighgty google
Invi: dont forget to offer your sacrifices
GilDash: looks good. i prefer it with rice tho. good old indian way
Eli: Can't be arsed with rice. Double naan breads for me, please! :D
I'm already in the temple of the internet, twilight_sprinkle. the sacrifice is sanity and social life :D
Invi: good, good, that is the internet's favorite foods
Sanity? What's that now?
twilight_sprinkle: i thought it was souls....
well I already dislike mirc
[Alpha], I use Hexchat
Gangnam style , love it so much
Eli: that too, innocence in particular
Is it any better?
best song of 2012
[Alpha]: i dont like mIRC, the only advantage it has is you can see name changes and kicks/bans
xD I found a bacon salt for vegetarieans to tatse the bacon
Bronysith: it's funny, and the dance is kinda cool because everyone can do it, but it's not a good song
Eli: it is not a good song... it is an AMAZING SONG
Does anyone know the name of a movie where someone is in a hotel room and every time he tries to escape he ends up in the room again?
Bronysith: yeah, opinions
Hat, no, you?
well I'm getting rid of it now
I'm trying to find it
Hat: groundhog day?
It's a horror film
Bronysith: skyrim>dark souls
Bronysith: skyrim is 22nd best game of all time btw, according to ign
i think it was 22nd
and IGN said that Black ops has the best video game ending of all time
I'll just use normal chat
not a reliable source twilight_sprinkle
Hat: 1408
Bronysith does it?
Well, there can be no best video game ending, IMO.
Bronysith: its one of the best sources there is
Hat, do you have more info?
Hat: 1408?
That might be it thanks
I'm curious how a story progressed when it's all just in one room
done with my music downloads
Hat there's a tropew called the bottle episode
*trope
(yes I'm always downloading music)
Tvtropes to the rescue!

that was a joke guys calm down
Nobsi: not funny
:D
Bronysith it wasnt meant to be funny
Will it be worth playing F2P or will you have the absolute worst equipment
Nobsi: jokes are meant to be funny
So, the chat window in the stream isn't loading for me. Is this a thing that is your problem or mine?
Johnny Guitar <3
I'm curious what everyone will say when I'm buying them though :P
Who is burping :|
Bronysith i could copy a entire wikipedia post about jokes and youll never read that they are meant to be funny
Is that figure your trying to get supposed to be real valuable?
this backround music dosent really match the setting
Nobsi: joke/jÅk/ Noun:	 A thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter, esp. a story with a funny punchline.
"I'm buying a pony for a friend in Canada" "Okay..."
Wikipedia :S
its fallout music, it fits everthing, no exceptions x)
What about tetris?
Nobsi, what is then the purpose they primary serve?
i found rule 34 stuff of ps2 xD
yeah thats too retro
Nobsi: Alternatively, if you would prefer a wikipedia article...
A joke[1] is something spoken, written, or done with humorous intention
Nobsi: its r34, no exceptions so not really surprised
really wut is rule 34
scout19_tf2: if it exists, there is porn of it
scout19_tf2 no exceptions
NO EXEPTIONS
....:S
DArn it too skow
Nobsi, how about VGA cables?
34,2 is There will be a Ponyfied version of it, if it exists, no exceptions
Why get it then? :P
To add to the collection?
I know if that rule :3
if u dont find anything you are forced to create some by yourself
oooh~ how tropical~
there's no rare or valuable pony stuff yet
Nobsi, nope I aam not :D
the show only came out a few years ago
Sing it Wreky :333
Invi cmon follow the rules
go wrek xD!
"I swear its not for me. Its for a friend."
YOu broke the RULES!!!! anybay, let's talk about about Fight Club and /b/
Nobsi, no. anarchy!! *poke a juicebox so it spills* mwhahaha
Lil_B Dont you dare! :D
anarchy forever. smash the system
I am enjoying Breaking Bad right now
Lil_B you got a achivement!
...
... damnit, I have no Wall space left to pin my Archievment too :/
Lil_B Now buy some shit on Sbox live son! xD
lol, exactly
Is like game going be laggy like every MMO I've played
the s in sbox stands for shit
hahah :D
^^
dead
nope
bff... I Still use the the Satelleview to uplaod my highj scores... now THATS a reference nobody here will get
see? ^
Hey someone can tell me WHAT acually is buyable when this game is released?
no not to you to me
will it be outfits or also other stuff?
Goku=360 (reliable but dies alot) PS3=Vegeata (tries to be the best but comes up short) Gohan=WII(had potential to be the best but is not) PC=Piccolo (powerful but overlooked)
lol
PC = Overloocked?......SON YOU WENT FULL RETARD x)
yeah...
If some of the pony stuff does get rare ill probably join you SR in collecting some of it
dont go full retard
what's wrong with an overclocked PC?
Console shitstorm is just so intense that pc seems to be overlooked in some places
lol
well
theres collectable cards that are selling for $300 each
actually... if you look at it percentage wise, the PC is a bigger market than the console market, but I don't wnna make a PC vs Consoles argument here, I like both and use both
Is it just me or will windows 8 make our ppc's to smartphones?
http://www.ebay.ca/itm/My-Little-Pony-Foil-Rainbow-Dash-Trading-Card-F37-Very-Rare-/200819317447?pt=UK_Toys_Creative_Educational_RL&hash=item2ec1c39ac7#ht_500wt_1413
im afk for some hours i need torchlight 2 to cast away the time
OK who did that Zoidberg sound? xD
that one went for more.
ciao Nobsi
bye Nobsi
I havent touched a console since the wii came out.
why would you want to cast away time?
o3o
daymn...it just looks so damn ugly
I don't think win8 is for smartphones.. thats windows phone 8.
its like a spit in the face for every Pc Purist
People will love it because its bad
Brad[Laptop] you have a point there sir ^^
LadyCanary: ^3^
wtf...
and touch stuff
I'm just shocked lol
I can see it working well on tablets
but I dont like how they locked down windows RT
they went walled garden apple approach
I wont pay full retail for a collectable
What's with everything losing mouse support lol
Poor little guy just wants to fit in.
they should make a Windows: Gamer with improved performance but less App, and smerhphone bullshiaaaat
Lil_B, I hate that touch trend thingy >.>
If I can get it extremely cheap ill go for it
Ive been able to do that with most of the collectables Ive purchased
Apple is doing it right, eexcept the performance
and the price
but the thing is some collectables are fan-made, and selling for hundreds up to thousands.
OMG!
its not even official merchandise.
and the sueing
the actuall Issues Win8 has are actually rather small in number, but they are all major, and easily fixable/changeable, but Microsoft refuses to
Spirituell Sequel to Nine People, Nine hours nine doors!!!!
gimme a Mac which is not too fucking expensive and has the performance of a gamer pc and ill instabuy
For MLP?
yes
also it should support more games
oh
Invi youn don't know half of the Sueing Stuff yet, believe me
Can the soldiers be killed inside the transport like in the trailer
Lil_B, that's what you think ^^
Ive had lots of problems with my retina macbook pro.
So many accents on stream~
I'm not too interested in fan made stuff because it could lose value
actually, the Windows "Surface" Tablet with the Keyboard costs more, than an Mac-Book
Dat Love in an Elevator
What is this vidya garm, it looks like a CoD ripoff.
LadyCanary: Ikr, it's an international stream!
you buy the fan made stuff because you like it, not because of future value.
Planetside 2
LadyCanary, whoow
ScootaChicken: its called planetside 2
ScootaChicken PLS be sarcastic
PLS
I don't always buy stuff because I like it
I buy to resell in the future
/me giggles.
Ive bought video games in the past and never opened the packages just because I know it would be worth more years from now
ScootaChicken Go to fackin' bed.
All the new one are just ripoffs.
Hey GilDash|Cooking, was my accent really bad when speaking english? :D
yay i found a way to play games AND being online in irc
Ashy Poo, why the feck did you leave the group.
Because
This more looks like a BF ripoff, but done better
;3;
ScootaChicken CoD MW doesnt eeÂ´ven have vehicles
reasons.
I planned to get some of it graded soon to make it official
But why wub woo ;_;
Lil_B, does it have a reason that it is that expensive?
Ew, gay.
/me pets LadyCanary ^^
:|
Lol rammers
:D
it would be fun to get one of these for cheap. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Microsoft-Surface-Table-/251169129813?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3a7ad8c555
Invi as much reason as apple has for their prices
Besides ScootaChicken, how recent have I been talking in the group?
ScootaChicken: Btw theres a difference between the same GENRE and a ripoff
Barely once a few days.
everyone has their thing.
I buy stuff because I enjoy it.
Lil_B, what really? nothing new on that thing? maybe it's because no one wants to buy it ^^
So how's stuff LadyCanary? :)
Fine.
woop, finally found the Kung Fu Hustle OST! in FLAC nonseless!
wb LadyCanary ^^
08,01what are you playing?
Most the time the conversation is about things I don't have a single clue about and well, I just got bored enough to quit it.
hi LadyCanary :)
Chat derp.
08,01now i want to play doom
08,01but it's only fun when people are watching
DashWithRainbows: Fair enough, but the chat is interesting enough most of the time for me to want to stick around.
08,01Bronysith: sure, but i'll need to find a working source port
DashWithRainbows, then start an own conversation about things you have a clue with one of the 110 other ponies in here ^^
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Pony Coloring Table
Plus I like all the people in the group and it's an easy way to communicate with all of you guys without needing to PM each one of you to find out how you guys are doing.
Ask Derpy, Nobsi!
Or resort to going on IRC, which I basically never do these days.
I'm on IRC more than Skype nowadays
could anyone bake me some muffins?
and ship them to me?
unless I'm at college.
Nobsi: i could, but they would be for me
well guys i must be off to class....have fun with BMN and i'll see yall later :)
LadyCanary is best Black Canary cosplayer
^
...No.
bye BladedWings
Surge, no.
Nobsi, i could, but they could have a bit fur when they arrive...
... oh part of the Ziegeunerweisen is in the Movie ? Must pai more attention
I made this for bronystate. http://i.imgur.com/OkLP6.jpg
Since it's the school term I'm talking with IRL people a lot more, which means I basically never use IRC anymore.
Nothing to do wat work
LadyCanary: but you're so goooood ;3;
Yeah but if you can make some money too why not? :)
Invi I just wait for something that takes my interests to come up most of the time.
Make images with phone XD
Lil_B, wat sin Zigeunerweisen?
Neil is forming a social life?
Because IRC is basically just for internet people, but I can talk to internet people on skype as well so YDK.
WHAT IS DIS
DashWithRainbows: I've always had a social life :P
hello everypony ^^
Dont even try for the flattery, MadSurge. Seriously.
I bought a video game this week for $2 dollars and its worth $90 online
cool
I DIDN'T GIVE Y'ALL PERMISSIOn
Hey everyone! XD
:)
Invi comming right up!
hi pot
LadyCanary: But you're so goooooooood
Its just not somethig i want to get into because I don't understand the market.
LadyCanary: why u so mean ;_;
I'm not a fan of the series but its stuff like that that I dont pass up :P
pot80: *
ijulkisa hey
ohh yeah that makes sense
Im not being mean.
O lol :P
You really have to know what to look for
Lil_B, dat song thar?
/me polishes MadSurge's armour.
exactly
Hi everypony :D
>_><_<
A good example is the atar 2600
ScootaChicken1: Zip it.
/me vigorously shakes Lil_B 's hand
DashWithRainbows: ;___;
What is best faction
Atari*
Hello ^W^
Invi yes itr's a song, by mozart even I think
:(
Neil, I call shenanigans on that claim.
there are 4 versions
oh okay
:|
LadyCanary: :33333
and they all look almost exactly the same lol
but one is worth way more than others
DashWithRainbows: You can call shenanigans all yew want boyo.
Spam everythere xD :O
i already do.
I*
OK, by :$6_9
ookay?
Don't change nothing though
I like buying and reselling stuff in games
This game looks epic
oh hai Sonny ^^
but I won't do it with real money
Like 2142
seems kind of risky
like if you can't resell whatever it is
Thats why if you do you buy it at the lowest price possible
risk = reward
Hey everyone, What about a Bronystate Clan or group or something?
Thats what Ive done for years
for planet side 2
There already is one
Yes! But I don't have beta
Wrek made it.
Sometimes you do lose money but you make up for it with something else
I was going to sell all my pokemon cards but they're not really worth anything
Sign me up!
Link link
it will be released soon and Scoota...thx :3
I might be interested
What do you have?
Sorry Neil, legal people only.
jo Sonny :)
that was fast Lil_B xp
We should definietly make it after release, we could make a TS and rule everyone so hard ^^
I dunno, I'll have to look through them again when I get home tonight
I have a few foils
I only collected the first generation cards
and one "eX" card or whatever
Invi was earlier I think xD
Just make sure to feed your pickachu.

CCCP: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/68f1218e29e738d96fae5cffd6625d10.jpg :3c
DashWithRainbows i dont think this game needs very high specs
I'd like to have a desktop anyways.
Laptop is good and all
aaaaah youre on a laptop
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Nintendo-Pokemon-Pocket-Pikachu-Virtual-Pet-Giga-Tamagotchi-New-battery-/261094533074?pt=Electronic_Battery_Windup_Toys_US&hash=item3cca7267d2 $60 for a used one
i get it now
Yep.
Wait...who has that German-esque accent?
DashWithRainbows: i recomend custom built. want a list of supplies?
MadSurge <3
i know how awkward it is to play on a laptop
even if its super good
Bronysith Already got the list sorted.
Just get a mouse, it's not that bad.
DashWithRainbows: okay, you going to build it or is someone else gonna do it for you?
its because its got value for kids who used to have one who have kind of grown up and want to remember them.
Going to pay my friend's dad to do it.
i dont want to wait 4 hours anymore could we start the movie now?
But I'll be there to watch him do so
Lolno,
It'll help out with my IT course.
LadyCanary don't know, I have pretty much all german Bronystatlers memorised, but only by name
DashWithRainbows: thats great, how much you spending on it? i had to spend WAAAY lot more than i wanted to
It's about Â£450 without a screen
going to use a HDTV for my screen though
Is PS 2 Bloody screen, Halo, or Medipack?
Screen turns red, need a medic to heal you.
nice, thank you
or a new screen
You have a shield, much like Halo's it will recharge.
wow this game seeems so perfekt
right now
Well
There are some problems
Huge, f2p, Original
like what?
such as unbalanced teams on servers
i have chocolate chip cookie :3
oh
500+ players on one team, others have to split the other 500
yeah but with this huge teams thats just way to hard
I like waffles
More boredom gives you more pics http://i.imgur.com/e0BHp.jpg

DaringDerpy is right
so people keep spending money on them
DaringDerpy, depends on the beer
Invi: Mario, Link, Kirby, and Pikachu
Go to Vodka instead.
Or whiskey.
Preferably the latter
Invi made in cooperation with namco, they are getting help from the Tales of Series Guy
NewSuperBronyU: :333
mitamaking, no one special yet?
Meep

mitamaking: Whatever, I'm not gonna buy nintendo just to play pokemon.
NewSuperBronyU: did you do anything for the birthday of the NES yesterday?
mitamaking: They're quite rare where I live.
Where is that?
MeElectronic, klipsch, skullcandy (they are alright but have duarablity issues) koss, sony etc
might be worth a try....the bronies here are the less creepy part of the fandom
DaringDerpy: Indeed.
Invi I wish :/ but alÃ¶most, the Pocket version :3 , for free anyway xD finally, I can Play my games in 4 shades of green and fiddle around with the coinbtrast again
contrast*
mitamaking: Czech republic, middle of the Europe.
Perferably headphones that don't go over the head.
what word contains one letter, begins with an e, ends with an e?
Oh, well good luck getting any game systems there

Suddenly, Scoot-Scootaloo and his non-HLGness.

Kanto Symphony is amazing.

11,02Barb|LoverPony: No ;~;
Aw

As soon as you can
11,02I forgot ;A;
NewSuperBronyU What games are you going to get with the WiiU?

11,02DashWithRainbows: I just said it ><
NewSuperBronyU yeah :) I really want that controller, I think it's good to have the Stickst on the Top
ZombiU looks okay, but I think they could've came up with something more original.
11,02mNew Super Mario Bros. U, Skylanders Giants, Call of Duty Black Ops II, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed, and Nintendo Land :)
Invi Wackelkontakt somewhere within the System, I don't know, I never had the chance to open it to examine it
BASICALLY EVERYTHING
11,02Lil_B: Yeah :)
I just went up to look at the list, not bad SB.
The problem with ZombiU to me is it sounds like a single mode in a bigger game
Lil_B, yeah i know that feel. that's what i just fixed
11,02DerpyWhooves: :P
...
11,02Anyway, shower time and then lunch! bbl :3
NewSuperBronyU man it'll be hard to decide eather watching you or Video Games Awesome whith the first look of the WiiU
NewSuperBronyU is apparently rich, if he can afford all that.
NewSuperBronyU your name is different :3
11,02CCCP: Yesh :3

I prefer PC over gaming systems.
Please don't ahte me.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOOA SuperBrony.

I like CoD, but not the people playing it.
11,02Lil_B: Video Games Awesome? o.o
...Huh...Okay, i'm not THAT suprized...I'm just going to be inside a box now...
The PC players for CoD are a lot better though.
NewSuperBronyU yesm, I <3 them

/me goes inside a box and screams

It's good :3

Phew...I needed that screaming out of my lungs...
11,02Oh wait, I just checked their site, I've seen them before o.o
kung fu hustle
NewSuperBronyU check them out if you have time, they are funny :) and the main guy has a normal and reasonable view on gaming (but mostly doesn't show it because he wants to Troll the people in the Lifechat xD)
DaringDerpy, B movies don't have to be bad
11,02Starflash: :3
Man that new Bond game sounds horrible
05still me on stream?
/me hugs NewSuperBronyU

What is that game? :>
Nightfire was so good

Heya, Lil_B ^_^
LAVENDER TOWN KANTO SYMPHONY

NewSuperBronyU: Mario or Zelda?

It is a cheap way out
1.9/10...that's what I meant, CCCP
D:
awww... because in the Minds of Nerds, it's impossible for 2 different things in the same field to coexist...
What if he likes both games equally? they're both very good :)
Isn't the point of B movies to either find a good B movie, or a horrible one
lol
Lil_B, have you seen the United nerd force from weeble? ^^
I'm actually going to watch BMN todday, I got Coke and I will at least get through the A-Movie (because the B-Movie is about 190 min long
Whoa

How long is this really? Does it last until showtime?
/me hugs Nittany_Discord ^_^
But I don't WANT to regress :(

Seriously, anyone, any incling as to how long this lasts?
Nittany_Discord: It's alright. It brings up bad memories for you. We understand. :)
cowvarkian: bullied?
I was bullied in Elementary school for no reason
It got a lot better in college and it was easier to make friends
While i'm never bullied, I feel incredibly sorry for all that suffers in thier lives. [gives a purple thumbs up] Say no to bullying.
LunasGuard: yeah that
This is two and a half hours long, Meanwhile.

Yeah but still, 2 and a half hours?
Never had a bully. Infact, people thought I would have been a bully. Proved them wrong by just being a shy, quiet guy. >_<
LunasGuard: :'(
During school, I gave as much as I got.
holy crap, i go to a catholic school...it sucks
Sumica: Sumy, you're my hero.

Sometime, I feel like "Why Can't We Be Friends" played in my head if there's an act of bullying.
I don't really get bullied, which is kind of surprising given that I'm half Asian, have emo hair and look like a girl.
pls
sonicdude558: wat
Yeah i'm like this guy. But i overcame the exploding part and all and learned self control
pls stawp
You'd have thought that I'd be a goldmine of piss taking, but apparently not.

sonicdude558: That's not somehting to joke about. :S
Fuck you, I'll bully all I want.
What's the significance of the image on screen right now? Two feathers with "You are not alone"?
And for also making Sprit Day on the Year of The Pony.

CCCP overstereotypical -.- Bronystate is the only Brony releated Site I go to every day
Its been raining all day :D
Nittany_Discord: what's happening to PT?
Pony releated*
I love it!
What is this on the stream? Just turned on the audio
It's a discussion about bullying.
Lil_B yeah i guess, i honestly find the show pretty overrated too, doesnt mean i dont like it
Well, Dark_Horst, it seems people don't like to acknowledge PT's transsexuality.
It's "Bullying Awareness Month", so it seemed appropriate.
oh boy
IO think most of the time I'm just an observer :/
11,01Dark_Horst: There's recent stuff involving Canterlot Gardens.
CCCP dude, I'm the first to admit, that I don't like half the episodes
Ah
:o
11,01And there's her/his transexuality, so she gets that.
who's talking?
Lil_B im suprise
Lil_B: wuuuuuuuuuut:O
This story sounds like one of those greentext stories on 4chan that ends with people opening doors.
And getting on the floor.
Anyway thanks for listening if you guys are not actually listening I love you guys and the fandom even though both have flaws both are great
And walking dinosaurs.
I was never bullied :I
Nittany_Discord: people harassing con guessts?

dari your hair is so bad.
Haaaah
CCCP yeah, seriously, unless I have a chat to riff about it I can't take some episodes. not that they are badly written, but it's written for a younger audience, and in some sceneces, THAT really shines through

I mellowed out in 11th grade.

sonicdude558: Love and tolerance is a somewhat flawed slogan. I don't hate it though.
Fokkin drop 'im 'enry
Ah
'Enry is well 'ard.
THats understandable.

The world is a huge, frustrating and complicated place.
Hello everyone
but some act like it is
USSR :o
hi USSR
Hi, USSR. :)
you!
Is this live?
I was seen as a weird until one of the cutest girls in the school fell for me :$ All the whiney bitches left me alone after that :D
It would be NICE if there was a place like Equestria.
how are things USSR
*weirdo
Oh dear, I don't seem to recognise this person :S
Okay, LC's story is way too meandering, could someone who was actually listening summarise it for me?
11,01For a few years in high school, I hated everyone.
I could've came in as SFSR, haha
hey USSR
good evening ladies and gents.
But things are fine
CCCP: The morals are deep but this show isn't really deep, in my opinion.
hi Alchemist
Im going to wait it out for the stream
Randomnerd: True, very true, but fear not, there's some things that made our hearts glee with a golden sunshine.
sonicdude558: I don't know, I'd love to have this recorded so I can listen to the whole thing leter.
First time here
Hi, Alchemist. :)
CCCP yeah, they are not deep, the timeframe in which tehy have to come up with the Storys AND the the aimed Audfience doesn't leave room to make something deep! and I hate peoples arguments "Just look at the References!"
Hi Tom :)
CCCP: Ikr, it's supposed to be for everyone, not just adults
Welcome to bronystate, USSR!
Why would someone watch a show for the references
Hi USSR and and Alchemist :)
what is going on in the stream?
11,01Thought anyone trying to make friends with me was doing it to troll me.
I still hate everyone.
AJIsAwesome|MK7 yeah iguess
We're all about fairness and equality, USSR >:3
We know :D
Tom? Where r u
BetaMane
bullies dont expect opposition
hai Lil_B :)
Hat: I agree. We shouldn't watch a show JUST for references.
Like video games...if it weren't for the comercial success of the Nintendo Entertainment System, we would of had E.T all over the place.
Lil_B: yeah lol
Nittany_Discord: I know that feel :I
I feel the need to make sure you know, it's integral to my character.
11,01Some did.
Hi Rarity
MadSurge i know and i love it for that and thats its really entertaining
11,01I had one real friend in high school. I have no idea where he is now.
Hello Rarity...
It's like going to a restaurant and ordering a roast dinner so you can taste the seasoning
Don't think so, VenHur; we wouldn't have video games in the first place
CCCP: Exactly.
hello
Oh, is this Shizu? :3
Hat: :D
Hat: don't you do that?
Polydunami: Canary.
Polydunami: It's LadyCanary
Oh :P
Ohey Das me
ohhh... now I can hear LadyCanary
Polydunami: She can't speak.
CCCP: Yesh, me too :3 it's like the Powerpuff Girls again
wtf. I remember something. i was bullied by my teacher in 4th grade

[Alpha]: seems legit
ello Scottish-geeky-schoo
Oh, I hear a Canary on stream :3

He's the reason I don't trust teachers
hi Scottish-geeky-schoo
hello AlienWarhead
[Alpha]: Your story reminds me of Matilda.
Oh so this is the person I first barfed on :P
hai AJIsAwesome|MK7
dat threat
They were closer than my own brothers :D
hi CCCP
[Alpha]: well thats psyschological trauma
O.o
*psychological
CCCP: PPG was for kids but had stuff that passed right over kids' heads :D
Psychological trauma is the worst kind of bullying, in my opinion.
Aww Yeah! I'm Back ^_^
[Alpha]: But more seriously, bullied by your own fourth grade teacher? Damn, I feel sorry for you.
Welcome back, Cypresswolf. :)
13Polydunami: protip, if you think it's me, it isn't
I understand
MadSurge ikr
i was constantly bullied in school. didn't affect me tho, because i didn't realize i was bullied :) it was funny
Shizuka: >.> in this segment the buddha is not shizuka
Lil_B: do your labs look like this: http://i.imgur.com/tZGoT.jpg http://i.imgur.com/trkgX.jpg
hey welcome back Cypresswolf
until 4 or 5th grade I didn't really had friends because my ADHS was really strange, after that there were some bullies, but mostly it was not having friends/not much friends that hurt me (and the accational bullying)
Who Is Streaming?
it's fine. I'm gald I don't remmeber much anyway
Hello Cypresswolf....Happy 2nd Anual Sprit Day.
Pink3: Scoot-Scootaloo.
God I sound horrid ;_______;
I've seen a whole "bullying by a teacher" thing on the news. A child with Autism was pushed and shoved around and called nasty names. It was horrible
LadyCanary: You sound fine. :D
Don't worry LadyCanary, you don't >_>
Shizuka: we still have to hear your voice :D (not that you need to, mind you)
LadyCanary: you sound a bit nervous
same in my school
Im stammering a lot >_<
Just got here, She's talking about bronies?
I honestly don't like my voice either. :D
I was nervous.
Metronome: Bullying.

Metronome: I'm guessing bullying
AJIsAwesome|MK7: how are you my friend
i hate my voice
Hallo Scoot-Scootaloo, i respect you for being a pegasister /)
LadyCanary: I like it. And I hate my voice too :D
LadyCanary: its not that bad.
Everyone knows bullying doesn't exist
Thank god
It's just banter
Speaking of bullying, that one Youtube video with the elderly bus driver... :'(
Lul
Pink3: He's a dude.
Says Dari
LadyCanary everyone Stutters when talking about a difficult Childhood, it's just the damn feelings and memorys that are coming up
Hey was anyone gotten crap for being a brony in real life, I think someone here said that

My Dab
Nowadays, i stand up for anyone if i see they are being bullied

DashWithRainbows: lies

Scoot-Scootaloo is a pegasister. Your arguements? Invalid.
DashWithRainbows: theft is totally banter
How old is Scoot-Scootaloo
AJIsAwesome|MK7: but seriously, i was bullied like hell. but i'm really, REALLY oblivious. i don't even notice if i'm being bullied
Pfft.
Just kidding...
DashWithRainbows: especially the petty kind
Scoots is 12.
11,01What's it like being a girl Scoots?
poor canary
We threw Dan Goth's bag in a tree once, it had no brances but it somehow got stuck in the top of it anyway. they had to go get a ladder from the janitor.
Alchemist well, the work places I was at looked like this
Because he plays CoD
who's streaming?
DashWithRainbows: totally
ScootaChicken: Top bant
I'm Oblivious to bullying
Quality par.
LadyCanary.
How old is Scoot-Scootaloo
At least now
[Alpha]: hey, me too

Im not streaming.
Oh...
That's just my voice on stream.
00,0310. I am 10 years ole
Pink3: Old enough to be legal.
XD
WHAT
Eli: I was bullied a small amount, but that's mainly because I was very introverted as a kid. In fact, it was until my freshman year in high school that I managed to get ANY good friends.
Scoot-Scootaloo Ten and a half.
YOU FUCKING LIED TO ME YOU SLAG
Lil_B: I was just wondering if you uni had this kind of new environment.
a 10 year old is a mod wut the fuq
Meanwhile: he's a fetus?
Scoot-Scootaloo: U SAID WAT?
And I'm perpetual jailbait.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Im eleven, it is good to know there are young bronies out there :)
ScootaChicken but the biggest factor is
cowvarkian: Yes. He's chatfetus.
Pink3: He's joking. :D
he is capable of becoming legal
I'm about sixteen...
Meanwhile: seems legit
you are forever jailbait.
18
Goddammit I sound RETARDED.
18 here.
LadyCanary: not nearly
I know Dari is 6 years old.
im a potato
AJIsAwesome|MK7: ;\ who would joke about that?
AJIsAwesome|MK7: i had some "firends" all the time. but since 4 years now, I have a friend. a real friend. i would catch a bullet for him
LadyCanary: Don't put yourself down like that. :(
LadyCanary: Kinda, but you'll get over it.
Are we listening to the same person, LadyCanary? :3
LadyCanary: Better than looking retarded?
Gah LadyCanary, I want to slap your bullies SO BAD now.
LadyCanary: Shucks...you don't really sounded that bad...
Oh dari. Oh dari. You wonderful wonderful man.
Lil_B: our uni has old stuff (I think I sent a pic about that too a few weeks back), these pics I sent you are from the science academy's biophysics lab.
11,01I sound bad as well LadyCanary .
Thats horrible! :(
11,01I sound like I have a cold.
:(
Bant.
Nittany_Discord: don't you?
ScootaChicken: DAYUM
Eli: Same here. I would sacrific my very life to save my friend.
AJIsAwesome|MK7: we're about the closest you can get as straight guys. like JD and Turk
11,01And I talk too low.
It's not horrible, it's just bant.
God.
Alchemist its more like a collage, or a high-school, and yes the new rooms look as white as this, but with more room and tables xD
:P
11,01My mom is ALWAYS criticizing me about that.
Scoot-Scootaloo: You Did Lie D: Cant believe u
*sacrifice
6am. I'm done. You banerin' bullies have a good one.

I never liked my voice as a kid. I always hated it.
Polydunami daww
Awwwwwwwww yeah/
Yaaaaaay Saxy
Dari, you ruined the surprise.
Oh, sorry bro.
I ain't your bro, brah.
AJIsAwesome|MK7: I have a hard time with my voice it is too deep
why is evry pony talking about how thay sound
Huh. The new survey got caught by my spam filter.
wait if this isnt live when was it recorded?
Saxy isn't even here.
Noooo, Now I can't vote.
AlienWarhead: Lucky you. I was targeted BECAUSE of my voice.
Scottish-geeky-schoo: because we can
11,01I think in July CCCP.
I also had a rough time with my voice...never speak most of the time...
cowvarkian: ok
Nittany_Discord thanks :)
I don't get why Saxy would get bullied.
He'd just be all like 'ARE YOU OKAY?'
Plus, I was a crybaby and I was very sensitive as a kid.
Because he looks like Indian Elvis?
AJIsAwesome|MK7: wut O__O
I guess you can say i'm unsocial, a lone wolf, a man with a few words, or all three.
MadSurge: What do you mean?
ScootaChicken <_< >_>
AJIsAwesome|MK7: me too
Saxy would just jacket them to death.
<.< I remember when someone thought I was threatening them with a bookmark
0,5Aw I missed my part
AJIsAwesome|MK7: what's wrong with your voice?
0,5I mean HELLO! :D
BaconMane: hey
11,01If I have kids, I will not tolerate them being bullied.
Now I'm sad. This weeks newsletter, and the survey link with it, got caught by gmail's spam filter.
Eli: If someone would tell me to shut up, even as a joke, I would break down crying.
hi BaconMane
Hey BaconMane!
Hello BaconMane.
Hiya BaconMane
Nittany_Discord: Same.
Nittany_Discord: Good luck with that
hello BaconMane
Nittany_Discord: why would you
heya BaconMane
And now I can't put in my raffle vote =[
Reminds of a time when this kid used to bully me because I was a teacher's pet. I would always get candy and he would take it from me.
AJIsAwesome|MK7: I got made of a little because of my voice, also my weight, my glasses, and other random stuff
AJIsAwesome|MK7: oh. not that hard i guess
Yeah..
ScootaChicken: Because http://i.imgur.com/c3prC.jpg
Its been in my spam for the past 2 weeks
I remember when someone thought I was bullying them, because I was saying that you could stab someone with their bookmark...
My mom found out. She threatened to kick the little kid's @ss and his mother's
AJIsAwesome|MK7: but i'm still very sensitive. but now i use that for being just a galant nice guy to be around :P
And yet, the 'lottery completion' email isnt spam. O_o
MadSurge: My voice wasn't that deep. It was very high pitched and I HATED it so much. I still don't like it today.
Meanwhile: Groliuous.
If I had kids of my own, I would be like a sensei to them, and teaches my little tykes on how to roundhouse kick bullies in the face.
cowvarkian: well dats fuqed up
im a potato
Violence never solves anything. Except this, it totally solves this.
AJIsAwesome|MK7: I'm not very deep either :P
if I had kids, I'd teach them to Bustah Wolf them
im a tomato
Eli: In fact, the only TRUE friend I had was 3 years younger than me.
Not the RP
er
scout19_tf2: yeah. and my school made me so community service
s
If I had kids (which I won't because perpetual jailbait) I'd teach them how to take the fecking banter.
He was basically one of the best and only friends I had.
Anyway AJIsAwesome|MK7 thanks for the talk I'll probably be back for movie night, later
*do
WOOP! the new Wrek it Ralph TrailÃ¶er has Dubstep XD
Bye, AlienWarhead. :)
USSR: lol
Oh yeah, and what else can I say..
Lil_B: :D wubwubwub
ScootaChicken: Just teach them to be a banter GOD.
:D
AJIsAwesome|MK7: my friend is 1 year younger. but if ppl look at us, they all think he's older
Bullying confrence. I love it...:)
Hi everypony
Hi, Kawaii_icybeauti. :)
hi Kawaii_icybeauti
cowvarkian: schools back then suck
I think i'll let my little tykes watches a ton of martial arts movies I liked and loved, espectially Jackie Chan.
That way, they'll be prepared.
Hai Kawaii_icybeauti :)
Hey Kawaii_icybeauti!
Hi AJIsAwesome|MK7 and Scottish-geeky-schoo MadSurge and Colt_Brovakiin
Hey everypony :)
Oh yeah, so who's talking right now?
Yeah, I'm a lean, mean, banter machine.
Hello BroPony.
hi BroPony|MEDIC

Hi, BroPony|MEDIC. :)
Heya BroPony|MEDIC
i know that feeling...
im a sad pony
Matt Smith can't handle my bant
Scoot-Scootaloo: Scoots is.
/me yawns
Matt Smith banters dari just by existing.
first I noticed my friends being diffrent was when they all started smoking.
He's the D to the A add an R and then an I, cos ain't no other bluds can par that fly, he's banterlicious.
uhhg rap
inb4 kick
:P
My friends left me after one of their friends told them they didn't like me. The worst was when I sat down at their table and they left like I was sick or soemthing..
ScootaChicken: You yenius
Dayum, ScootaChicken laying down that verse
Yeah, all my "friends" deserted me. They wouldn't keep secrets about me, they made fun of me (even though they knew I hated that), and they would alienate mme.
well everypony i have to go going to hit the hay
/me bows
Eli: Never trust smokers, never trust 'em.
I gotta say... that was SO COOL. coldeven
I alienate myself
then you did it right. you stayed yourself. i did the same, but yeah it turned out well
*my "so called friends"*
See, I've got good friends
AJIsAwesome|MK7: i had that happen to me
Did this start at 4?
I totally binned one of my friend's stuff the other day
Highschool really is that bad?6_9
Not entirely my own fault
But he forgave me. :P
08,01you're such a *good* friend, Dari
Metronome: For some people, yes.
Middle school was my experience with hell
^
yea nowim not looking forward to highscholl
I HATED Middle School.
Middle school will kill you.
A lot.
REAL friends are the ones who accept you just the way you are. i get some strange looks sometimes, but my best firend hangs out with me nontheless
Best advice I can give for high school: roll with the punches
Meanwhile: another time we agree on something
He didn't go and get it, and didn't ask me where it was
Eli: Agreed.
So they cleared the bins
i liked middle school more than i like highschool ;/
I read all through middle school. So I was fine
And it was gone the next day
:P
im a serviver of middle school
CCCP: that means you were the bully
Going to work... be back later
Thanks god I never attended Middle School...
Middle School is so insignifcant
and no pony is talking to me
hi guys, whats this bullying?
THANKS. FRIGGIN'. GOD.
Eli: real frinds help you out and warn you when you are about to do something stupid
pot80_MCproject: Interview about bullying.
yeah, people take advantage out of my interests like halo
lol
Middle school: it's basically useless
oh ok

Hello everypony.

hi Canadian_Brony
Hey there, Canadian_Brony
Hi Lil_B scout19_tf2 :)
Hiya Canadian_Brony
Hi Canadian_Brony :)
Eli: I mean serious stuff that could hurt him/her really bad
Hai Canadian_Brony :)
CriticKitten: what ddo you teach?
USSR have i told you that i really like your name?
thelonepony: how r things

Eli: not just mischief
Who's streaming?
Scoot-Scootaloo.
Canadian_Brony: hello dare
Algebra and above, cowvarkian.
Alchemist: in german we say "zusammen Pferde stehlen" to steal horses. it's like being very close. and if he asked me to steal a horse with him, i'd do it
Bullying is character building, the real world is tough, it won't treat you nicely, and you won't survive in it if you think everthing it goign to be all 'flowers and rainbows'
High school level.
CriticKitten: ah, ok
CriticKitten: Really?
haha CCCP USSR this stream must be soviet controled
Yup.
going*
It is....
k thx AJIsAwesome|MK7
CriticKitten: Jeex, where the hell do you live?

The soviets control everything....FOREVVVVER

Naw, it's not that
Scott standed up to bullies. Like a goddamn boss!
It's pure laziness

We're just lazy. We parrot the information to please, and we drop it and move on to the next thing.
Kawaii_icybeauti: *on
wut?
I think real friends is when you know, if your friend asked you to break the law with you, you would do it, but you know he would never ask you such a thing
what he say?
Eli: sure they would
Jose :P
lopez
whats hping with stream
Your name is stupid and you're Canadian.
Bullying interview.
True fact.
Meanwhile: you're welcome
Wow. Total dicks.
'Your name is stupid and you're Canadian' is one of the greatest things I've ever heard.
AJIsAwesome|MK7: ah
Hallo Guys,I need some Dr Phil action for a sec, one of my friends doesnt like that i am begining to hang out with some people more popular than him (i know popular isnt neciscarily the koolest) and he wants me to lose all my riends except him,even dump my gf,which i suspect he will aask out if i do so. And the "more popular" people are actualy my friends. And he is my gfs close friend,that fact, he could probably convnce her to break
why are people so striotypical?
tl;dr
wat
pot80: Society.
Because people suck.
Geeze, people are fucking picky.
Bottom line of the world
pot80 because everyone is a steriotype :3
Ooooh
Pink3: talk with him. you can't do that. he can't do that
Kind of the reason why I want to move into the woods :/
Hearing this depresses me
Pink3: choose the other people over the one guy
I hate, that in 99% of all Bullying, is just to show of for others and to "be funny/though" I know so many bullys who would be so normal human beeing when you approach them alone, but when we were in groups, they act so obviously just to show off -.-
That explains it
the only thing i have against canadains is der driveing
CCCP: not really its just part of peoples traits put them into steriotypes, noone is an exact steriotype
Metronome: But it's necessary to bring up. We can't keep this stuff unearthed.
It brings memories of my experiences.
Pink3: thats something I cant give you advice on. Sounds more complicated than just a few lines in a chatroom.
Pink3: if he's your real friend he wouldn't ask something like that
WAT
Hahahahahahaha
.........
dafuq
Pink3: Just apologize to him and ask why.
oddd shcool
HAAAAAAHAAAAA
WTF?
Lol
wat
cowvarkian: But remember he can convince my gf to dump me probbaly
wut:O
There's a guy at our school called Jack Benda, I think that Scott is pretty acceptable compared to that tbh.
Pink3: i do not know but hers one thing never let othe pepole ruel over u
:P
Wait...WHAT?!
VenHur: apologize for what?
Masterbating makes you popular?
Uh...
Scottish-geeky-schoo: Ik :)
pot80: i guess
that is sick.
ScootaChicken: I say wanker...
Pink3: yup
Wht did he say? wht's with the WTF Comment?^
what the hell?
Oh geez ....:S

I hate the masturbation question from bullys, whatever you answer with you are always wrong -_-
Wht did i miss D:
I thought this was going to be dull, hell was I wrong!
f
Lawl Meanwhile
Sometimes I look abd at my really really sucky awful friendless schooltime... and than I hear other peoples Storys... and I think to myself "Through all hell you have gone... its nothing compared to this..."
pot80: this is why you fucking walk away
Oh -_-
11,01Funny how EqD is advertising a lingerie site because they sell pony costumes.
I remember a time when you were the most f*cked up person in the world if you watched porn.
Just caught a taki with my mouth :P

If you weren't gay you weren't popular?
Nittany_Discord: Celestia's Secret.

If you weren't gay, you wont' be popular?!
j/k
what are you talking about?
pot80: why should you care?
In my school it's the same thing...people having sex at 13...*sigh*
WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY IS THIS MADNESS?!
this makes me happy to be in my school now...
Can't win for osing.
Human thinking at its best!
Eli: I am trapped with a bunch of immature sixth graders, too bad im not a genius, so i could go 2 high school, i would suspect they are more mature than theese chldren
13it's why we can't have nice things
When I was in school it was being gay that made you uncool. It's all topsy turvy now.
[Alpha]: sure
Did that guy just say 'Spermenting'?
Ya can't win for losing...
ScootaChicken: sure

Hi, Pinkies4thWall.
I have a mission for you
Every brony i've seen were very nice :/
We should love and tolerate each other. But if that doesnt work I just ignore. It's just dumb to be caught in a flame war.
Oh, this is a screwball chatroom :D
bronies are a cult
RosePetal: No.
bullying is bullying, it doesnt matter if its a brony bullying, or a jackass or mother teresa...
Why can't no one loves My Little Pony? It's the greatest damn thing since tacos was invented.
A good cult, CCCP
Love and tolerate is not something to apply to real life.
Polydunami: We're ALWAYS a screwball chatroom. :D
in a show to do about friendship? Hell I've had decent conversations with some trolls after rationalising with them but I would never be able to do that in real life

G3.5 (I skipped this, ZOMG WHAT THE FUCKING BARBECUE?!): And the Oscar for "Worst Generation" goes to...
OH GOD
cowvarkian: If I have it's been removed to make room for RAVING FURIOUS SEX.
A pony dating website :D
NewSuperBronyU|AFK: Nice. :)
Meanwhile: hah
/me noms on thelonepony

I will never forget that.
tired as usual, you?
Meanwhile: I hope you won't
00,03Blame Violet, Canary! D:
That stream at one point had the phrase RAVING FURIOUS SEX be relevant.
:S
NewSuperBronyU|AFK do you lucky nomming on ponies :3
08,01huh, apprently heartsandhooves.com already exists and is somethign else
Scoot-Scootaloo: Can I blame her for the RAVING FURIOUS SEX?
08,01we need a new name!
Oops
This happens for every fandom. You can't deny that.
So right>_>
11,01SpecialSomepony.com?
RosePetal: True.
/me 13smacks scoot
08,01Nittany_Discord: that works
08,01and it's not registers
SCOOTS. WHY. NO.
i always thought that, but when i said own character everyone told me i'm stupid...
08,01LET'S DO THIS
.3
im not drunk enough for this
i dont think its good to be serious about that sort of thing
give me a few minutes
....OH GOD NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Lyra`: I doubt that
Aww Lyra` you missed it, there was RAVING FURIOUS SEX.
/me cries forever.
:O
11,01Hi Lyra`.
AND I MISSSSSED IT :<
Or I will be forced to find you and end you
It can be an OC if you draw it.
hi Lyra`
oh hai Nittany_Discord~
:P
LadyCanary: You okay? What's wrong/
Pfffft.
/me 08,01puts an arm round Canadian_Brony, "spaghetti! spaghetti everywhere!"
sup Lyra
damnit daribot.
Everyone always asumes that OCs are Mary Sues or Gary Stus. But if they are well written then there not. People need to know that.
hai scout19_tf2
Skeeta
/me doesn't like spaghetti
>implying good OCs exist
ScootaChicken is that a registered website? :|
Lyra: wuts goin on
Polydunami: It is now.
implying? :s
08,01huh, apparently angrysex.com is available
11,01Kids who think that OCs need rules. Maybe in RP.
*ridiculous
Pfft
Pffffffffffffffffffffffft
>implying that every Oc is Mary Sue.
08,01she's a red and black alicorn
08,01who is celestia's cousin
Would changing Twilight into an alicorn and calling her Quuen Eos count as an OC?
Lyra`: Based on yourself is it?
DO HO HO
08,01and bearer of the 7th elemnt of harmony
how did you know?
:P
shes a blue earth pony, and i have a picture ;3
Lyra`: random guess
My OC is glorious: http://i.imgur.com/dFSkn.jpg
His name is Pon Jeremy.
AJIsAwesome|MK7: Because here's where it gets TOTALLY off topic
LOL ScootaChicken
Wht is Mary Sue?
He's the sexiest mofo in Equestria bitches.
doing homework, gonna idle for a bit
LadyCanary: AH. Okay.
Mom's spaghetti
Canadian_Brony: spaghetti means spaghetti
my OC is probably the only Chemist Pony
TT_TT
EVEN TWILIGHT HAD SOMETHING GOOD IN IT.
NO IT DIDN'T
hold on
I created my avatar, people bully my OC all the time
...
ScootaChicken....wtf is that?
cowvarkian that doesn't help.
>implying Twilight is good :|
08,01my OC's CM is a cornucopia
Hahahahahahaha
Canadian_Brony: you're welcome
BRB going to kill myself.
Twilight is best pony
08,01it's a pun
Meanwhile it's still warm when you burn it
Metronome: An OC character added to fanfics that oversahdows the main cast, can do no wrong and is perfect in everyway
LadyCanary: cool
[Alpha]: My glorious OC.
LadyCanary you will be missed :(
:) <--- this Twilight is awesome
^
A taco is best pony.
BEHOLD
Thx
MY OC!
http://tinypic.com/r/1qod5h/6
4 The info
08,01because a cornucopia is also called a horn of plenty
also, theyre is a reason its cropped
Lyra`: That's RAVING FURIOUS SEX alright.
V is best
;)
Oooh, Shizu is playing some Bejewled lately...
Meanwhile: hah
It depends if the OC does not have any flaws then it's a Mary Sue. And if the character just learns things easily then its a Mary Sue.
Lyra` why is it on a bed?
CCCP: because sex
That's REALLY pretty Lyra` :3
08,01Shizuka: i had a dream about you a few nights ago!
AAAHAAAAAA
o.O
Cool
used to be a furry?
OH MY GOD
no
watch the chat go
cowvarkian is right
WHY DID YOU RECORD THIS.
Bronies and furries are like, totally the same thing.
00,03Paleo used to be a fury. Go say hi to hm
08,01Shizuka: you were beating the everyliving *crap* out of soem zombies
Is RAVING FURIOUS SEX a meme yet?
ScootaChicken: nearly
00,03furry*
dari: I'll work on it.
Oh God no, not furries
....?
Furries. Furries everywhere.
Scoot-Scootaloo: I AM FURYYYYYYYYY
there are too many foxes...
I'm pretty sure RAVING FURIOUS SEX is a meme Dairy.
He got tired because there was too many frickin foxes.
Woo furries forever!!!
gtg, cya
Oh my fucking god.
if you want the full picture of my OC PM me
>furries
i like how noone notices the blatant similarities between our community and the furry fandom
Dari, techically, bronies are furries.
well... I know Furries xD yes, there are many Foxes xD
i prefer he used to be a fury
Meow :3
NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPE
he was so mad
Pinkies4thWall: Well no, they aren't
he WAS fury
I thought this was going to be totally dull, but it proved me wrong. It's fucking hilarious.
sumerpan says that in this segment RAGING FURIOUS SEX
I don't feel like I want to see it :S
cowvarkian: That's now a thing, it's happening.
I'm pretty sure i'm not a furry...I don't even have a Gardevoir on my Diamond and Pearl team... >_>
furries are fine people
....
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_leobr7Z7mO1qchw13o1_500.jpg -- twilight was mentioned earlier, this is in responce to that
:)
/me facedesks
how do furries taste?
08,01so we're all furries
^No
08,01CCCP: much like anyone else
So no, we're not furries.
By my definition
11,01Furries and bronies aren't exactly the same.
^
I don't clop to ponies.
And I don't care if your definition is different.
00,03Gardevoir is mah waifu~
That's what furry has always, and will always mean to me.
RAVING FURIOUS SEX with a horse. That's a furry.
Furry Likes Human animal things, Brony likes MLPFIM TV show
05tehre are furries
:S
05that are also bronies
05but msot bronies are not furries
prince dari some furries arent interessted in porn at all they just like the anthro art style :P
IIRC, Silverscreen is a furry
Meanwhile: thats not really a furry...thats beastiality
hold on
08,01i used to be a furry
oh hell messaging froze again
Canadian_Brony: He is.
08,01my character was a comet moth
cowvarkian: What's the difference.
THen aRrrow to the knee?
Every Fandom has this.
^
Irc op I know is a furry
Meanwhile: ask a furry
08,01i just liked RPing on MUCKs
what about the otakus?
pot80: Furries not being interested in porn is an oxymoron by my definition
be a furry, be a brony. who cares? do what you like. live your life like YOU want not the others.
http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o206/Chiese/1138673128104-1.jpg --- which are you?
08,01i have no interest in animal porn
'There's a lot of people that can't take criticism very well'.
inb4 emangamer
Okay, So I had a Gardevoir and a Lopunny on my Diamond Version team...
cowvarkian: I don't want to get too near one of those, that's hazardous to health.
Wut?
08,01scout19_tf2: well, i changed because the furry community became shit
Meanwhile: then fucking use google
Dark_Horst: Not even humanoid, only human. Speech alone is enough to qualify as anthropomorphic.
08,01believe it or not, the furry community in the early 2000s when i joined it was much like the brony community now
cowvarkian: I 'aint googling nothing with the word furry in it. that's hazardous as well.
I know a brony who is also a furry Wrek. Really nice fellow.
Which OC is BaconMane talking about?
08,01it was a lot less creepy
...And yes, both of them are female, thanks you very much.
Oh wait, the one that isn't MoonDasher.
i honestly dont get one thing though... how are dragons concidered furries?
DOHOHOHOHOHO.
xles: that'S why i took lion king as an example
11,01LC used to have an alicorn OC.
08,01scout19_tf2: no it wasn't
CCCP: no, scalies
LC?
OH.
No they are called reptiles
Nvm.
I don't like furries because to me that's just going around telling people your sexual preferences.
And yeah, that's totally not sarcasm :P
08,01Polydunami: i know... i already see the shit setting in
Lord Celestia
08,01it's how communities go
I don't want to know
cowvarkian but then why do many furries like dragons?
What you do in your own time is fine
But don't tell me about it
:D
^^
oh boy
Not bronies, 'cloppers'
08,01the furry fandom is not all about sex
Would be the same as furries.
08,01in fact, for a lot of them it's not about sex at all
^satur
My think can't brain today.
im not a clopper, but i liek to sleep around
Sumerpan message of the day. http://i.imgur.com/mOldy.jpg
Dark_Horst: By your definition
wierd but amusin :P
Lylat Wars
By mine is does, explicitly.
11,01Hey. My old meme.
I used to be in the Total Drama fandom but I left it because I could not stand the people flame warring each other over shipping because the now bad writing in the shows.
And you understand exactly why people have that perception.
mfw about 45% of the fandom are cloppers
I'm not a clopper, I'm double dog promised i'm not.
Yeah I have seen some good picture that depict the Main 6 as humans.
Dark_Horst: no
And THAT'S not a lie!
its not bad though
08,01but i claim that i was
No comment.
Dark_Horst: Didn't say that, but I don't like people who go around calling themselves 'cloppers'
08,01but not by your definition
11,01CCCP: Source?
cowvarkian: tell him that
Wait, can the people talking see this chat?
Dark_Horst: no
Dark_Horst: Because what you're actually doing there is going around telling people about your sexual preferences
11,02dat dari
brb bathroom
Which is just no on.
MOO
That's some weird shit
Pinkies4thWall nope
dat SB :3
Keep it to yourself
cowvarkian: why do you no me then?
not*
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom
08,01infernap: exactly
Well, Mlp universes can be whatever they want. They can be out of control.
Just to be on a fair note here, as much as I loves the Total Drama series, it's NOT a game show, but rather a parody.
Dat AFK NewSuperBronyU|AFK
08,01it has nothign to do with sexual preferences
11,02AJIsAwesome|MK7 :3
08,01it's part of it for some people, just like in this fandom
11,02Dat meh o.o
Wait...what's going on?
That's a theory.
I'm gonna follow you because http://i.imgur.com/mOldy.jpg
I guess you wouldn't call Lylat Wars a furry game because it's not pornographic :P
I still remember the drive to GalaCon... with the 2 Girls on the Backseat Cloppoing... well, just saying "ClopClopClop" over and over again
Nittany_Discord well i did an anonomous pole once about 100 answerd and almost half said yes. but agian its not very accurate.
08,01but to tar them all with the same brush is just naive and silly
dem dats
and if regular users had that kind of discussion they would get warned by the mods
das NewSuperBronyU|AFK
Meanwhile: AHAHAHAHAHA
11,02Lyra`: O.O
Hah
ASoftFluffyThing we're discussing fandoms.
sorry dariy, but now you're being biased
I know some people love HTF but they hate the gore. They perfer love stories. That's there opinon then.
You think the word means something different to me.
i dont enjoy it as much as MLP, but i do follow a certain furry web comic
CCCP: Then again, that's only a 100 people.
There is nothing about maturity in it.
I still want a mlp plushie
11,01I can't even hear myself here.
Canadian_Brony: Oh.
08,01so there's a disparity there than can be misleading
xles, you forget that dari has his own definition of furries
Hey, you don't get to choose what everyone else defines you as.
08,01as i said, by your definition, i was never a furry
well to urban dictioonary
Testing Link, www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MgWtfBBq&feature=related
08,01that doesn't mean i was never a furry
yeah, the Furry Community (the way I expirienced it) is just like the Brony Community in many many ways
Everyones out of character. Because of theories and people's opinon. They can do whatever they want I guess.
to me, liking anything anthromorphic considers you to be a furry by definition, be it anime, stories or anything. That being said, just like ANYTHING THING ELSE, there is always R34
sorry took a while to get the image
08,01it means that only by your definition i wasn't
AJIsAwesome|MK7 i know i was just bored and had nothing to do and i recently saw the EQD what kind of brony are you and 25% there said they clop
11,01Scoots, remind me to speak up in future interviews.
>definition
>biased
Bullshit
What is a biased definition
that's what you keep telling us
It's not based on opinion
11,01Metronome: No video links during stream, please.
if you like SPC, you are a furry
That's jsut what the word means IMO
11,02sex is bad cause my mommy say dont cause it bad an also i had to clean my rom dat day but got in mor trubl so no comp :(
Definition isn't opinion.
whats SPC?
What is your opinon on cyber bullying?
I think this chat needs more RAVING FURIOUS SEX
yay moms goin out ;)ima throw a brony party
And since it's a made up word, you can't tell me what the definition is explicitly.
Samurai Pizza Cats
I have to get ready for my pep rally, I might come by later becasue my game doesn't start until 11am. Later everyone!
i should finish my oc... it's lying around for ages now
Quick question, what do you call a furyr interested in the "sexual" side of being a furry, we have "cloppers" what do they ahve?
CrimsonPhoenix: The drama is glorious, shh.
/me doesn't know what's going on besides the chat discussing fandoms
bye Kawaii_icybeauti
There is no 'right' definition.
just because SB, wanna run that by with more vowels
That's not a video link D:<
Bye, Kawaii_icybeauti. :)
All words are made up, dari
and more constanants(*sp)
ScootaChicken, as if they'll listen to me
Eli feed it before it starves
08,01you said it's not opinion
00,03As of now, we all have OC's
he doesnt even notice
00,03;_;
What are they even talking about anymore?
@_@
Scoot-Scootaloo, I dont
08,01then you said it's your definition "IMO"
Scoot-Scootaloo: I don't. :S
Lil_B: it's probably dead then
08,01which means "in my opinion"
Scoot-Scootaloo how so?
Eli noooooo
The urban dictionary has too many definitions for furry :(
11,02Chrysalis: Cnt by nymr :(
[Alpha] lol
Canadian_Brony: I'll change the topic when we've finished talking
I just saw a my little pony commercial that was advertising the princess cadance doll
This stream was surprisingly well timed :D
00,03The people on the stream, I mean :P
hi weeping_pegasi82
Did I remember my fire-retardant clothes today?
Funny story, this guy named BigEd came onto a MLP stream and lined the comments with the word faggot. He made one mistake by pasting his link for his livestream. Man we went over there and all used the name as BigEdisabitch and put Bronies forever bitches.
The Kingdom Hearts fandom is even more crazy. The majority is basically fangirls and yaoi. The females get constanly killed because they get in the way of their fanon which I find really stupid.
Lil_B: ah no. it can't die. it's an alicorn :P JK
hey CCCP
and not to mention the houndrets and thousands of people who are both Bronys and Furries xD
Ok...ay
The definition I hold isn't based upon opinion.
08,01and you're wrong
But it is my opinion that that is the definition.
Eli mine is a Humble Earth Pony... WITH CHEMISTRY!
Two completely different things.
good to know
lol remember when people thought Princess Cadence was annouced and people hated her.
Kingsom Hearts Is BEST GAME EVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
but really all fandoms are really weird, so i think our fandom isn't that bad compaird to some others.
08,01so yes, you can continue using that definition
I'm going to go shower and get myself some food, and when I come back, hope the topic has changed. K?
well i gots to go c u guys at movie nite :$
08,01but that defiinition is wrong
Lil_B: keep mine pegasus. because the ability to fly is one of the things i wish most
I don't have an OC. [Dun dun duuuuuuun!]
In all honesty I got nothing against furries, cloppers or whatever
I love Kingdom Hearts but their fandom is crazy.
There is no correct definition.
CrimsonPhoenix: The heirachy, dealwithit.jpg
CCCP yep. all fandoms are weird, contain weird people, and do weird things :)
11,01That blog is still dead.
^^^ Huh?
According to what?
me neither
This convo
ScootaChicken, it's hypocritically stupid
I love Kingdom Hearts, but what RosePetal said is true.
^
lol "no absolutes" argument.
^^?//
11,01And that OC is almost gone.
Eli I wanted mine to do magic, but I said forget that! I do Chemistry and so does my OC!
08,01i.e. the ones who identify as it
08,01as they are defining what it is to be a furry
08,01in their action
I think this has turned into semantics.
so, this is fun
I'd say it's more majority.
i dont like the home stuck fandom
Brad[Laptop]: no shit
really
Back on topic again.
I hate kingdom hearts, for the sole reason that micky mouse is in it.
....
RosePetal: there was a topic?
And you can't tell me you know exactly how many people use each definition
but i like hommestuck :/
Seriously, Rocknrollpony- ?
That's quite picky, Rocknrollpony-
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: The Brony Show to Interview Brony Documentary Head Laurent Today!
CCCP: I've never read homestuck. What's wrong eith the fandom?
Ok
I thought there was never mind.
But Mickey Mouse is fucking awesome.
Thats...pretty stupid.
Lil_B: i love chemestry, but my school right now doesn't offer anything like it
I love kingdom hearts :)
Lil_B: besides, magic is almost a scientific element in Equestria
Good morning everyone. :)
Ryunosuke: That's different
Hi, AdamTheDuck. :)
no, not really
Is it?
That would make it generally accepted
AJIsAwesome|MK7 its a fandom... its just very odd in some areas :s
Not correct.
There is a difference.
Well micky mouse in a game is great, just don't like cross overs.
He's one of the main highlighted characters in the animation studio department, Disney's mascot, and an importaint piece in animation.
nothing against alicorn OCs. but they just look silly most of the time
RosePetal: It hasn't been confirmed.
Because we all know that it all started with him.
08,01which is not correct
08,01that's all i'm saying
and so you are making a general accepted definition as opposed to what is actually true? :)
Well, I disagree
Isn't the sexual "furry" preference defined as a "yiffer"?
im back
i really just dislike things like the .MOVs and stuff like that
MadSurge yeah, but Still xD
I'll just go back on Background Pony....much more entertaining
what gildash said
Speaking on general internet knowledge here...
BTW,Are We even Discussing the Talk Show?6_9
The Mod sessions :P
GilDash: it is
08,01that's up to you
What did i miss? Had to pick up my younger bro
GilDash no
With this
*Podcast
Eli: hm what kind of school level are you in?
Rocknrollpony: I loved the SNES game, Mickey Mousecapede, Mickey Mania, The Illusion games, etc.
just as there are cloppers in the Brony community, there are Yiffers in the Furry community
You missed RAVING FURIOUS SEX.
I have in 3 years never heard the Term "Yiffers"
Yiffers? 0_0
I just enjoy the porn...
yiffers
XD
some people like to sexualize everything. its going to exist everywhere.
And no, I wouldn't consider you a furry.
Rocknrollpony: I hates Magical Mirror and Disney Party...because it's another Mario Party wannabee.
08,01fair enough, that's your prerogative
Lil_B: it's not widespread. becasue many people confuse definitions. like we're seeing right now
11,01Yiffers are the porn lovers of the furry community.
shana: uh... how do you say that in english. no idea. one higher than high school
I never even HEARD the term "yiffing" until I watched the CSI episode xD
This is weird :S
shana: it's just a sucky school
0,5Oh i get it. Surries, Yiffers. Bronies.... clopp...pers....
Technically a word to discribe a groub of people with similar interessts has to have a definate definition in order for the group to be accurately connected and represented by that interesst, in that way furries are an interessting community as the have a vague connection to each other but have created a group based upon it :P
08,01just so long as if someone says they were a furry, you need to understand that they're saying they were a furry under their own definition
And with that I'm going back to lurking and watching this chat unfold. XD
I licked that micky mouse game on the gamecube or n64.
after walking my dogs i come back to takling of furrys and yiff 0-0
Eli: kantonsschule?
And I already knew about furries :D
well, by porn I mean drawn shit
08,01as they might not know yours
Nittany_Discord but lets be honest most furries are yiffers or at lease it comes off as that
*Liked
05yiffers = cloppers
shana: you're swissÃ¨Ã¨Ã¨
But, the crazy fangirls love the villians. Go on badguyconfessions blog on tumblr and see all the things the people typed in. Some are just weird.
05furries = bronies
05we have more in common than you think
:o
shana: ???
05stay open minded mah bronies
Eli: yep :)
Wrek: hmm
^D:<
Rocknrollpony: Mickey Speedway USA? Oh that was good...
Wrek: makes sense
Wrek: people dont know how to be openminded sometimes man
and yes, that's right
Wrek: I'm fine with this
RosePetal that works the other way around you know
But guys, I thought all bronies were cloppers?
True.
the furry community is VERY similar to the brony community
Dark_Horst yeah, but even within the Furry Fandom I've never heard the term yiffers
so it's really ok for mods to discuss that kind of topic but not for us users?
ScootaChicken: ikr
Eli: I noticed youre hostname a while ago, you're the first swiss I noticed :D
Stigmas are bullshit.
good or bad
shana: duuuude! first swiss brony i meet here. it's a WMS wirtschafts mittel schule
So I'd rather just use the definition of it I have so as not to associate people who don't deserve that stigma with it.
Wrek: You're telling me that the largest community of cartoon fans in the world has something in common with bronies? Inconceivable!
Moring all
But again, it rips off another thing from Mario, and that's Mario Kart...
Played that, it was indeed awesome
11,01Can't believe how terrible my volume is.

Genius.
i also really don't like some of the "memes"
Lil_B: i did. i once read the word appeared witht he description "the nosie you get when you rub two foxes together"
FINALLY.
Yiffers..never head that one before

AdamTheDuck: no dont nom me
Yeah, fair enough
gentelmen-geeky-scho, what argument have I woken up to on BronyState? :$

UBER
UBBR: what's your point
AdamTheDuck: idk i just came back from walking my dogs and then i see somthing about yiff furrys and porn
...So...uh...who liked wrestling...?
CCCP: what memes do this fandom make?
gentelmen-geeky-scho: good for you
VenHur: brohuf
VenHur: it was not very effective
cowvarkian: yup
d
XD
I think "Yiffers" is more a word used by people who don't know much about Furries, most just say "yiffing" or something like this, but nobody gets called a "Yiffer" , but yet again, I don't really communicate with Furries, There is only a lot of Stuff I read and witness
Eli: hmm wms doesn't sound like they offer much science stuff.. I went to a "kantonsschule" which had some pretty decent science program
Didn't the characters on the show bullied other characters? Remember in Putting your Hoof down when ponies were being mean to Fluttershy? And what about Ponyville Confidential? I'm surprised there are no fix fics on that episode but yet Mare Do Well and Canterlot Wedding have all kinds of fix fics because none of the characters apologized.
0,5No moar text walls about it
Yeah, wrestling sucked these days, I have watched WWE, it sucked, don't know about WCW or TNA though...
Lil_B: the problem is that even the community itself cant really agree on the terms
Sorry.
GILDA
Alchemist like... erm "20% cooler" "The fun has been doubled" they just seem forced they dont really make sense and arn't tjhat clever
UBBR: New guy? :O
UBBR: good luck with that
Gilda is best Gryphon.
Or am i just missing something here?
shana: yeah, i wanted to enter one, but i blew it. now i'm doing my BM at taht school and that's fine too
HavokOC: Baconmane.
Ooooooh
Dark_Horst probably that :/
>.<
[wall of text of whatever UBBR is talking about]
Gilda is worst friend
:3
I wonder if the bully episode will be about The Mane Six being bullied as school fillies
CCCP: I thought they are just terms thrown around. I didnt realize those were memes.
VenHur: did you here that da wwe is taking down all the atitude era stuf down on youtube
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3HErOOaAfs&feature=g-all-f I know about no video links and whatever, so sorry in advance, but this is brilliant background music for this stream.
00,03If you're wondering why there's a skip, its because I need to wrap this up...
shana: last year, after that i have to do a 1 year praktikum and them i can do a fachhochschule or something else
Lil_B: there is a site though dedicated to that word. so it must find some acceptance inside the community
thanks you *sniff*
ScootaChicken: Hahahahahahaha

pony_2780: most people do every single night. Except for amputees.
shana: yep they do
Eli wtf, how do you accidentally type Â¼
BronyCon was eh. BronyPalooza was probably one of the greatest moments of the summer
08,01Rex_Ivan: sssh! if you say that the joke doesn't work!
I shared a bed with another brony once.
So... is Raving Furious Sex, the sex bronystate needs? O.o

Not toy sized...

Just look at how clever some of those sorting mechanisms out. Not even the build, but just how clever the idea is.
wut u men Eli ?
Im going to guess contraption hax
<.< inb4 this guy makes robots for skynet
pony_2780: forget it. did you think of a name yet?
I don't know the name, but try searching lego rube goldberg machine on youtube.
when I was really really young I used to dream about endless marble mazes
no, Eli im lazy
imagine the maker putting this on his resume
inanely complex contraptions for legos
imagine having to take this thing apart
WE HAVE CIRCULATION!
is this even legos at this point? or is it just robotics?
So badass
That crane arm is amazing! It looks so good!
:o!
and im sitting here drinking julebrus

alexxm: apart? bah, ridiculous
Lyra`: lego has a big production wing in robotics
and then it all starts over
Holy jesus...I mean, Holt celestia...
Is this some kind of cruel joke?
Lyra`: they call it mindstorms, i think
Aaaaaand it loops back :$

VenHur: Red Herring!
Pony_2780 I'm doing Steel Reserve beer. We can make a game of it if you like ... but I may rather not
how many days is 600 hours
wish they added how much that thing cost
It doesn't look like any of the parts get clogged either. That means the speed the balls move at is consistent too. Amazing.

Sith, you did that already.
That's why I like "Fall Weather Friends" it's not focused on her being blindly arrogant. It's her and AJ both letting their competetiveness get the best of them.
