I'm going to filter out all the vowels.
6Just, a TON of random wordfilters.
>:)
>:)
6On completely random words.
4Exactly
4I think April Fools would be the ideal day to just screw with everybody by using a ton of wordfilters
6TRUST THE MUSHROOMS
6I filters to "I'm from the barnyard"
I'm going to wordfilter all the pony names other than Rainbow Dash to worst pony. :P
8DO IT DARI
8DOOOOOOOOOOO ITTTTTTTT
6Also, MBA related filters
6Random things filter to it, but it all filters to something else
Derpy button is best button.
8nope
8this is best button: http://instantbutton.me/buttons/ds2_20110710044121.html
6"mod" filters to "supreme overlord"
Lawl.
Hai
8sprinkles should wordfilter to sprinkleberg
6YESH
13Hay guise.
13If you wanna see me shit myself.
8...
13I'm gonna livestream Amnesia tomorrow.
13Around 4-5 pm est
13:3
8ummm
8we all have to be here for mod interviews tomorrow
13Is it tomorrow. I thought it was today.
8yeah, wednesday
8we're interviewing metal link at 4 and sathi at 5
13M. THEN I SHALL RESCHEDUEL.
12LOOOOOOOOOOL
4Amnesia, eh
8actually, lets take this over to the mod channel
6Ovo
but yeah, i want all of us to be here, or as many as possible
It wont be hard to change the time.
i mean, sathi is basically a shoo-in
Don't wanna count our Scootaloos before they hatch, however
yeah, but still
;o
she would have to majorly fuck up in the interview to not get hired at this point
shes older, has mod experience, has been to every single BMN, and is in europe
tiga1124
AND SHE'S A GRUL
that too
*ahem
*gurl
and honestly, thats a pretty significant benefit
Granted, yeah, that's a really good starting point
because she has a different perspective on things
I care more about personality and how they'd handle situations. :3
She has most of us partway into letting her in already
But still
12!Pokemon
It's not the questions part that bothers me
I have no worries there
12.-.
It's the pictures
12!pokemon
Lati, you are a 11Woobat.
All it would take is for her to bomb the pictures part
and I wouldn't be too sure about her
But if she's modded before, then I guess there shouldn't be too much concern
You're such a diva, Hip :P
seriously, fuck that picture
And I don't mean to pick on you (well, I kinda do), but, it's just blood and gore
and ponies
i would rather keep blood and gore away from my ponies
6YOU GOT BLOOD AND GORE IN MY PONIES
6YOU GOT /OAT/ IN MY /CHAT/
YOU GOT PONIES IN MY BLOOD AND GORE
People CMC ship? Really?
13!pokemon
I'm not surprised by that, I'm surprised that I didn't even think about that
People ship EVERYTHING.
No, yeah, it's understandable
I'm just surprised at myself for not thinking about that
Of course it's gonna happen
I'm sure there is
oh hey, forum's back.

most people hate us
I hit the ponychan button on the bottom the screen

It's overrated. lol
02Venezuela is Underated |D
still considering Tumblr
i personally don't feel it's really that bad here, it's just not good either
you'd probably think a lot of places were overrated if you lived there
if that counts.
6I don't like Fireflies. But this parody is awesome.
12lol
the grass is always greener on the other side
I'm talking tourism here. lol
dari: No
13I just hope some woman doesn't try to have a conversation with me in Spanish this time
13that was awkward
13Too much effort D:
I'd be kind of insulted if I gave fans something that awesome, then had it turned into something that crappy.
lrn2espanol
:P
no, learn Italian.
lol
Spanish > Italian
Or Swedish. That's closer to English.
dutch

12It just makes me face palm every time I hear about someone moving to the us from somewhere even nicer and saying their an American
spr srs

well
it's a superpower
12.-. *
it's a rich countr
y
13I'd rather live where I am right now |D
I like living in the US
I'd also like to live in other places
I'd rather live in not where I am right now
a lot of people in the US say they'd rather live somewhere else
like me
where do you live, Armads?
Soviet Florida.
...
well
13!weather Scarborough, UK
12I used to live in one of the top ten best citys in the US and even I wanted to move XD

12True
The grass is always greener on the other side, like I said.
*sigh.* 14% after 17 minutes makes me cry inside.
I wanna move to Antarctica.
also what's "best"
I prefer purple grass honestly.
Purple is a very underrated color.
as in top 10 "best" cities
12That was from survey results
needs to not
strangle my servine
wat

I don't want to live somewhere else.
Grass everywhere else sucks.
12I lived in Tucson Arizona, in case you want to know
:P
okay for a moment I misunderstood that, Dari
I live in California
Hahahaha.
12Witch was one of the top ten
where it is always foggy
and there is no sun
I think I see how you misunderstoof it.
THERE IS NO WARM CALIFORNIA SUN

I live near like

and if you want a roof on that house, tack on another $500k.
13And now I'm hungry

12Because you're all awesome, I need a good handful of people to type Cows > Eggs ~
Eggs > Cows
13LOL
13Cows > Eggs
thanks, I just try to coordinate with a few euro friends sometimes and it helps to know their time. But I've got it now thanks to dari.
:o
Chickens -> Eggs
6I know, we pretty much have timezones wrong.
:D

MANDARIN

13But fruit > China

lol
SOMEONE HELP ME
6...it goes off my clock.
6Or it should.
6Why, what's it say now?
I would think it would be the same regardless
since its a countdown and not an actual clock.
6It's a countdown.
6What's it say now?
6It should be 03:00:43:10
hmm
6 1 hour?
6Oo
yuo
yup
I WANT TO DRAW
6FUCK YOU TIMECLOCK

Whoops.

Sorry, just a sec.
6What's it say for you?
and yeah clock still says 1 hour for me...
02:19:41:00
6FUCK
/me dies
Why fuck?
6Because that's WRONG
6No.
oh
uh
6That's BAD.
It shouldnt adjust.
6It's a countdown.
6It shouldn't adjust.
12Okay lets try this again
It would be incorrect.
12Cows > Eggs
...
yeah^
Chickens -> Eggs
Cows > Eggs
If stream is at 7 est, countdown should be the same regardless of timezone. Otherwise, it would be an hour off for me or 6 hours off for dari.
06Cows > Eggs = Chickens < Cows
06what
...Let me check this.
13Cows > Eggs
Chickens -> Eggs
Chickens -> Eggs
Chickens -> Eggs
06:33333.3.

when you disappeared for like 2 months I had no idea

also why would you ever write down password

Have you ever been on Everypony?
7Indeed.
7Except when I lurk.
hi
6no reason to complain about someone paying attention to other things
I was just pointing it out
idk
Not 100%, I might have heard of it before.
7Pointing out...
7Hmm.
7Wish I could retort.
Well, they're doing this "all day broadcast" soon. They really want to beat Celestia Radio.
Where do you guys advertise? Ponychan?
6best just to let it be
6anyways

whats up
13!weather Scarborough, UK
6...oh hey Prison
6!weather 92835
I'm affiliated with Celestia Radio.
I was just pointing something out
7Different topic:
6fairly similar temperatures, that's good
it's like if I said the sky is blue and you went "why are you complaining?"
6I'm getting worried about LA summer temps
7I want to draw expressions like his. D:
6lol
Dude, I crashed right after the aftershow.
6expressions are fun
6but
!weather 48098
6SO AGONIZING
7But I find my style not cartoonish enough. D:
6to learn
6s
6I lack time for anything ugh
6speaking of which
6I have 3 phones calls to make brb
But that's another story. The point is, they don't like us for some reason.
WHY DID I MISREAD THAT AS 3 PONIES TO CALL
Because you're haunted by them
Hmm.
no thanks to people here
6oh drop it
^
now I feel like you guys are antagonizing me over nothing.
6...
6um, no
6I'm not
/me 7snirks.
I just asked why I misread something
that's illegal now?
no.
Ew
6I was saying drop it when you said "no thanks to people here"
Someone wipe that account
6and once again, this topic is going o longer than necessary
and it was actually meant sarcastically
/me cries in a corner
7Hmm...
aint that the truth
I posted it because drf misread phones for ponies? O_o
/me shot
7Eh, I'm too nice for you, DRF.
6Oh, trust me, I know plenty about the people being rather rude to try to be something else...
:)
LOL
*:/
oh ok
6And you really should stop in this week, it's going to be a great showing.
7I'm nice. Don't push me (or anyone else, for that matter).
What're you doing anyway?
at the moment I'm restocking my neopets shop
when you said "too nice for you" I was thinking dating lOL
7Good for you.
o.o why the meanness all the sudden?
6what was the third call I had to make x.x
I contributed to that a couple times. XD
7I'm not.
7Yet. :3
7Maybe passive-aggression.
I shall!
7Maybe.
"good for you" is generally not a nice statement
7Or just passiveness in the entirety.
6I think for now this topic should be dropped
6both of you
6since this is just about to explode
7Sure.
why would it explode? I'm not mad o.O but whateve

6You work with Celestia Radio, yes? Could I get a link to it?
6so yes
Sure. It's at ponify.me

7Ah, AMVs.
6k I'll think of some if I can
OK

6not that I thought he would, he waited too long
6but argh, that means i'm on my own
heh
6I just need to remember to charge my phone for irc
6Well, we're not exactly doing anything of the sort... though I'll be sure to remember you should something come up... which is unlikely. : D
I'm in a bind
6again
my friend can't see it this weekend
do I wait a week
or go on my own
:/
What's the rush?
Cool beans xD
6and why weekend?
6speaking of phone charging
and uh
6didn't realize it was about to die
I have 3 day weekends though
6my phone had NO service
6which is weird
6my phone always has service there
^
6I asked my friend, she didn;t have service-
just wait til it's done
6before the movie
6I was in line since 2pm
eh
...LOL
no wifi?
the imax here has free wifi
6I'll bring my laptop see if it has wifi
o.o
6I don't think I tried last time, I just used my laptop for movies
I meant use wifi on the phone
6..
6duh
6lol
lol taking laptops to movies
why
:o
And lol wow
nah
and technically
it's too handy to get rid of
6dude
you can call and text over wifi
ARRRGHHH
6when you're in line
6for 11 hours
THE PUN - IT BURNS!
wtf 11 hours
:P
o.o
Why
I could always give you a hand in finding something to eat
THE GOGGLES, THEY DO NOTHING!
weird
I waited in line for ONE hour
the punch has been.....spiked
and got the best seats
6harry potter 7 part 1, I was there at 2pm for my spot in line
then again
6because high school lets out at 3
>imax
imax is awesome
6and EVERYONE had tickets i swear
6the line was ridiculously long when school was let out
6I got near front of the line
til 11pm
6and the 15 other people in front of me
LOL
I just order my tickets online
*will
6no...
no, why would it?
My theatre doesn't have any lines
:P
see
the imax
only has one screen
...
Lolwow
I went opening weekend for part 1
showed up an hour befor
*e
Same :)
was like first in line
because most people
don't bother to see it in imax
6midnight showings are insanely hectic
All our theatres here are single screen lol
o.o
what's the hurry?
6granted, you'll still get lines on opening weekend here, but not nearly that bad
6um
6it's not a hurry
6it's just for fun
7Back.
That would be my handiwork
6plus, I'm THAT excited
waiting in line all day is fun?
6um
6yes
that's news to me
well
I'm impatieng
*t
7Not just waiting, I assume.
6people in line make groups and hang with each other
7Communicating as --ye
7Yep.
ew socializing with people IRL
/me runs
6the girl right in front of me, she made a ton of food, based on the actual foods from the series
Lawl.
6^lol
^ Same
also: correction
Come on guys, these jokes are getting out of hand.
I lost interest in that show
DRF
After the first round or series, I dunno XD
6anyways point being
6midnight showings seem ridiculous when you have to stand in line for ages
Keep trying :P
6but when you bring blankets, food, laptops with movies, games, more food, make friends, etc
6it's awesome
I'm sorry, let me offer my hand as an apology
6yep
They're good bros, though.
not sure @ the second part
but
They made the station the best on the intertubes :T
the imax is like a 45 minute drive
6Oh, I'm sure. It comes with the territory.
13gahhh I hate my stupid dodgy mouse and its stupid double-clicking thing
inb4 "here, take this"
I could ask
/me is now forced to start the TohoSort all over again
6For... whatever reason. :/
It's unfabulous to go alone, here tak this.
It's uncool to go alone, here take this.
6Or vice-versa.
lol dari
It's stupid to go alone, take this (textbook)
It's dangerous to go alone, here take this.

I was wondering if you guys wanted to implement the announcer voice at the beginning of each race. "3, 2, 1, GO!!!"

i liked my ipod touches when i had them
ipods touch
that would probably be more correct
y u have more than one
even one

i had a first gen and i liked it but i lost it
Good :D
I got a iPod nano 4th gen for free :

Katy Perry kissed a girl and she liked it, does that make it OK?
/me runs
But I didn't want it
maaaybe
and then a couple years later i got a 4th gen and i took it back because i decided i'd rather have other things
Problem?
i had the iPod touch 1st gen before the app store
back when there was no reason to have one lopl
besides jailbreaking
which i did

there's not too much that competes with them anyway
basically it's a phone without the phone
smartphone that is
gonna go eat and watch something bbl
I see
and you can even use it as a phone via skype
No wifi ;p
oh no?
Alright, thanks.
the thing is
A real phone has 3G or whatever they used/use now
less than half
lolwut
pff
have you seen some of the "phones" they make
I haven't seen any bigger than a 3DS, no.
oh they make them
they make those
Oh
You mean the 80's models?
no
I loved them :)
they make smartphones
O.o
various companies
Well
I generally dislike phones/smartphones
meh
(No jailbreaking, tons of free 'apps', good graphics, huge screen)
My aunt does
.,.
the thing is i really don't go outside range of wifi much
Yeah
I'd only use a 3G card if- No DSL or Wifi
I'd just get the cheapest possible data plan thing
The phones and plans here
are very...meh
and make sure I don't go over it
just EDGE
which is okay-ish
it's tolerable but not preferable
I kinda find all cellphone wireless to be slowish
I guess I'm not used to the speeds :P
If you go into cities or at least somewhat urbanized areas you can get faster than DSL speeds
o_O
else it's just kind of slowish

Oh mai
6I mean store
04http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com/meaning_of_Seran.html
6she takes a bus/taxi service to get here, because I think she's at a service home
6anyways
Rhy?
12oh, a regular?
12o.o
6but when she DOES come
6we get a phone call ahead of time
>:
6I'm not sure the whole story
6anyways
but hey, Seran is a girl's name :D
Syril is a girl's name too XD
6is at guest services waiting for her
how is Rathicus a girl's name >:
6they either escort her around the store or have another high ranked person do it
How is it a name? O_o
):
12lolz
how is it not a name?
6not just for the lady's sake, but for the employee's sake
o_O
You ever seen a baby, asked "aww, what's he/she called", then been told "Rathicus, DESTROYER OF WORLDZ!!!!11!111oneoneonoeone"?
6there tends to be an interesting amount of employee activity there in that area
12o-o
6specifically, 3-4 MORE people than normal
6just in case
t
6when she's finally done
6the woman uses one of the motor seat carts
Oh wow o.o
12wow o.o
6things "MUST BE BAGGED LIKE THEY SHOULD BE"
6quoting her, she said that exactly
6so we have to do guesswork as to how to bag them
6the jist of it is that everyhting needs its own bag lol
12you'd think the First Lady was there o.o;
o_O
roooofl
6and if one thing is wrong, the cashier takes full force of her verbal assault
6after she's done paying, and giving out the last of her complaints, she goes up to guest services where she uses the phone to call her transportation
12and waits D:
;o
6and then she leaves
6on the rare occasions where the transportation company doesnt do things good enough for her
She should have someone phone ahead of time when before she's finished shopping.
6the LOD once had to drive her home
6dari
6you don't understand
6that's WRONG
/me 12nods
6and yep
12>>
6she's got a mental illness I'm sure of it
6but in her mind, it's wrong
6so we can't go against it
6basically though
Hey Turni.
6within 2 minutes of the call that she's on her way, the entire store knows
6and we're all ready for it
6dari, then you wouldn't survive in retail
12XD
12p-d
12the customer is always right
Nah, I'd get fired for arguing with her.
12live by that phrase
12or die in retail
FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
6which in definition: we are dehumanized and are to do whatever the customer wants
Any of you still awake?
/me 12nods
6because we are retail employees, not humans

Don't you know, the customer is an idiot, they won't do what's best for themselves, you have to do it for them. :P

12did you hit some-

03I get in
03and back out
03well I hear this loud noise
03then go "crap, I was next to that pole"
03but I get out, no dents or anything
03well
Oh fun o.o
03was it shoved the wheel out of alignment
03so in order to go straight
12oh jeez O_O
6if the wheel is centered
03I have to turn the wheel left
03and keep it that way
03But
03Aurora
03here's the thing
I see.
6I also noticed that happens with our van too
03every time I go over a bump or anything
03it drifts a little
03x.x
._.
6if it does, not very far
6that would break the axel
03would it?
03all I know is
did anyone translate that quit message XD
03SOMETHING happened
03and it's like
03it's not just the steering column that got screwed up, because as I said
03if I go over a bump
6as far as I know, that would cause the wheel to continuously go closer to the other wheel, since it's no longer paralell
6parallel
03like it goes ka-thump
The countdown is wrong due to timezones.
03rather than just thump
Great
We're fixing it sometime. Lawl.
I need to restart my computer bbl
6but i'm not saying you didn't do something wrong
:P
6*are
03say if it shifted by like
03a degree or two
03I realize that's bad
03hence why I'm freaked out
6still
6yeah though
03my mom's like "no, I'd rather take it to the dealership"
6get it checked on
03but eh
03well
Hahaha.
03I'm thinking, well if the wheel got shifted over to the right by driving into something
03what if I drive into something th eother direction to forciblyh shift it back
03well
03I missed a little
Like a timezone were Mel Brooks is still hip. ;P
/me 12faceclaws
Fail
Epic..fail
03so like
03I now have a legit use for a crowbar
12that was a STUPID decision...
03to pry the metal out
03well
03when I say drive into something
03I mean
03sit parked
6that
6...
03and then try to turn the wheel
12regardless
03if thath makes sense
03-h
Lawl.
12hitting ANYTHINY
12*G
12for ANY reason
12with a vehicle
12is stupid
12x.x
03yeah I know
03two wrongs don't make a right
03but I was hoping a left and a right would make center
/me hides
12then why do it?
12-.-
FOOLISH XD
03why not?
03isn't that how it works?
12if you loosened something
03it wasn't loosened., it was jolted
12hitting it again would make it loose moreso
03as I heard a loud noise
03or something
03well w/e
03I just need to find a crowbar
07because if the wheel rotates, you can't tell exactly where the alignment is off
03so I can pry it out
03since it dented
Sooner or later.
03hm
How do you feel about this week's line up?
03is that something that's easily fixable though?
03@ alignment
12*door
03um, no?
07very
03put it this way
/me 12shot
07they do it free when you do a tire rotaion
07*t
03wait
03so
03you think all that happened is I shifted the alignment?
03rather than something actually bad?
hey
07you may have dented the wheel somewhat
hey
07but that would only happen if you were going fast enough
hey
03no
03I wasn't
03I was parked
03and backed up at like 5mph maybe?
03the odd thing is
03like
03it was moving perfectly fine then THUD
07so then it was just the alignment
03OK
03I'd imagine all it needs is to be jacked up and whatnot?
07pretty much
03OK
/me phews
03I still mihgt ask my friend though
07I don't remember how much it costs but it's not expensive

XD
Rainbow Dash first, Derpy second. :P
nm
Twilight probably last.
With Applejack.
I like twilight because her character is halarious to me.
Just another <insert average group leader> to me.
Wow I feel stupid. XD
Why's that?
you gotta see the conversation above it.
Probably for not having Rarity as favorite pony. ;3
oh okay
Rarity is under appreciated pony.
I agree
She's not exactly clever, she loses noughts and crosses every time.
:P
Pesant. :p
Peasant* :P
ok.
ugh.
moving on.
umm.
idk.
Now that Rarity is firmly established as best pony. We can change subject. ;P
idk. Movies? That's my solution to everything.
Thanks dari!
:p
;)
I think we had this discussion before.
...
How did I typo that?
bitch*
That was no typo.

Over 9000
03HI
*glomp*
http://www.rinkworks.com/stupid/cs_monitors.shtml
hey :)
sorry if i'm slow responding, trying to get used to a diff IRC clent
client
you went to XChat didnt you .-.
i went from xchat
xchat is ok but meh.
inb4 Kvirc
irssi
u lurking dari?
ew
/me shot
Why yes.
it's actually awesome
lol.
irssi + screen = best
He's looking up Rarity/RBD slash fics
But really mIRC client is best client.
but it's /all/ text
03oooooooooooo.oooooooooooooo
/me pops all but 2 of Sneas's eyes
/me mauled
And I'm sure they're all horrible
why don't you like fanfics turni?
mirc is xchat with a fugly scripting language
03oo.
The One
:(
You have arrived
granted yes most are crap.
03.oo
dammit XD
but at the same time, it's easy
but there are some that are really beautifully written.
mIRC has the best scripting language.
Whichever one doesn't make me puke afterward.
Easiest thing ever made.
especially some of the ones that get featured on EQ daily.
03WHO DID THIIIIIIIIIIS?!
/me runz
I've found some that are.
meh
Have you ever read any?
perl is superior in features, but mIRC is easier.
XD
/me RUNS
I have actually.
I dove into them when I had a troll-fic project going.
and it gives us something to do while we wait for season 2.
Gimme a break. It's no substitute at all.
for one, interacting with outside programs is usually a no-go, unless you do something GTSDLL style
How long ago was the project?
I'm sure you could do it with sockets.
Theoreticly it's still ongoing
Might be a bit complicated though.
well, for example
for mIRC was around 40 something lines if I recall
i used to have one for Xchat as well, that was around 10 in perl
I bet I could get it to less than 10 in mIRC.
Ok well you can watch season 1 over and over and over.
it could be done by putting multiple commands on one line
:P
I actually just watched the Matrix Saturday
i.e. static remotes or random output remotes
And make a point out of never writing while sober.
but for more advanced scripts, python/perl are bettar
you still lurking dari?
Yep.
add something.
for 90% of remotes, yeah
please
anything
dont go there.
XD
but remotes aren't the only kind of script :P
anyway
/me poofs to deal with some ddos attacks
Best puns ever.
I read the one that was preassured onto EQ Daily.
missed you ;-;
I dunno which that is.
I know, how about some of yours?
Sure.
[13:59:23] <~Altair> it's actually awesome
[13:59:35] <~Altair> irssi + screen = best
/me hugs back
EW IRSSI
;-;
/me is using it
why
D:
i was like
Oh that's the weakest argument known to mankind.
i lost a /ton/ of shit
._.
03DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
I never claimed once to be a writer.
yeah.
get konversation then
~750gb of data
LOL fuck no
or fucking using mIRC on wine :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!
use*
konversation is a piece of shit
or use pidgin
kde branded apps suck loolol
But you don't have to be a master chef to know that some food taste bad.
KDE is a fuckshit
nah
hate it
hah
>:(
lmao
KDE used to be /the/ shit
like
KDE 3ish
KDE sucks now lol
and 2
I still hate it anyway
Gnome <3
now it sucks
Maybe to appreciate all the subtle flavours in a really good dish you do. :P
lol gnome
sucks too
:3
Gnome is a bit bloated
taste is opinion :p
but it's nice
03GNOME, LXDE and XFCE ftw to me :3
XFCE <3
that's my arguement.
tbqh
and LFCE or something
/me forgot the name
03LXDE = best to me
Ok. You want some good writing?
give me a window manager
How about... read a book?
haha
couple of extra progs, i.e. conky and xclock
use windows' desktop environment then
and i'm good
:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
hahaha
/me uses fluxbox and windowmaker
haven't tried fluxbox
>|
is it good?
/me runs
lol
cygwin
:)
You're still going with that argument, seriously?
yep. It's my favorite. Disprove it.
you already tried once, give it another shot.
/me porn
You got my point. You can't deny that.
/me is glad he didn't store that on the disk he lost
/me shiftyeys.
03XD
rofl
03brb switching computerz
syslog is a bitch
[05:12] <Armageddon> haven't tried fluxbox
Managed to read that as "haven't tried windows"
03fuckbox
Went wut.
and nomming all the fucking CPU
the load was at 9.x
x_X
haha
lol
it lagged the server like fuck >:
i like that vhost
haha
/me wonders why mIRC eats up 99% of the CPU on the VM when it fucks up .-.
because it tries to parse the shit
and it freaks out
and does its thing
mIRC has a bad habit of going full retard
i doubt
usually the only time i had cpu/mem spikes in mIRC was when a large script was running
:P
03weird sht happenz
mIRC
03i*
can't handle data
and my !pokescramble script
fucking freezes it
i know
a lot
which is why it keeps freaking the fuck out
remember the anagram script i had?
The only time mIRC haCPU spikes for me is when I accidently screw up a while loop.
oh yeah
03lolSKYLANDSIN#SPAM.
every time someone used it

wat
/me never watched Digimon or played the games
haha
I've only watched
Sometimes the point is not to follow the same style of the show. To do something different.
Digimon Adventure 02
02I've only watched
02All of them
in fact
02Except 02
and played Digimon world DS
02Because it was bad
02 was nice >:
and only the first two movies
I watched them when I was a kid
shockhorror
^
i was 8 i think when the first one came out
good memories
0202 was basically the same episode with just a little changed(Lol like Pokemon)
and to entertain other fan's of said show.
but still there
Its something they can relate to.'
02Rinse and repeat
^
it was very repetitive
XD
and I owned at least one of the games up until the latest gen
which i pirated but never finished
Sadly I've lost interest in the games too lol
Well I sure as shit don't relate to Pinkie Pie carving up Rainbow Dash.
02Yar har twiddle dee dee
all i do
erryday
you need to be more active
on the forums
and also check out my sig
/me hides
lol
02And check out my cbox avatar
Pinkie pia and rainbow dash were names and beings you recognized correct?
therefore, you related.
:p
XD
dem digimon
also, fuck yeah
lmfao
quotes
wb Sneas
:D
the second quote
I just made up on the spot
XD
first one is like, my favourite of all time
i typically like the ones dealing with religion and government
and law
"This cute show about pony friends needs more hardcore sex and brutal murders"
etc
o_o
hmm
02Meaning
[14:36:22] <~Altair> i typically like the ones dealing with religion and government
[14:36:23] <~Altair> and law
how do i color in irssi
"I'm going to makes these characters do something they wouldn't do normally, specifically to entertain other fans of this show"
and lol religion and government
law yeah
/me thinking in text.
I like the ones dealing with freedom
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/funny-facebook-fails-strange-coincidence.jpg
02Watch out, I can't see crap, beware of random subject changes
/me hides

his quotes
are fucking awesome
"Everything has been figured out, except how to live."

ok
And of course it had the best puns ever.
they by themselves were worth the read.
8hello
heh
COLORS
"Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does."
i had a large collection of those wallpapers
That's one of my favourites
with quotes
<3
3 o-o-o-o-o--o-o
my favourite is still the freedom one
my fav of all time
"If freedom is outlawed, then only outlaws are free"
that is the fucking best
"Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks" -Dr. Dre
rofl that
and hey
it's okay to be an outlaw
:D
that one makes me lol
and yep :p
I sure must be a boring induvidual. Yup yup.
!Digimon
PTS, you are a 6Machinedramon.

freedom quotes are my favourite ones
because often I can agree with them
/me listens

/me makes lunch and a hot chocolate
at fucking 2:45pm
Instead of crude aproximations of other things with ponies in them.
02That's ironic

Well. As I said, I don't think good writers should waste their time with fanfics. They should aim higher.
but yeah
It's not all worthless just because it wouldn't ever be featured in the show. Like this, is canonly possible but would definitely not make an episode.

Well its a start I guess.
I show up for the movie nights and usually every weeknight about the same time if you ever want to get together.
You turned an otherwise boring evening into a fun little debate.

Saved my name? Where, how?
If that's ok.
Ok, I suppose.
Fuck that shit.

And it snowballs out of control and you can't actually debate anymore. Just brainless arguement of opinions.

03how long does it usually take?
03http://www.speedyautotroy.com/ <- is that the place you were talking about?
6no
6forgot it's spelled weird
03o.o
6SpeeDee
6but that should work too
03http://www.speedeeoil.com/
03that?
6yeh that
6but the one you posted might work
03well yeah, no SpeeDee stores in Michigan
03if you look at the map
03XD
03well
03all I see is tire rotation
03nothing about alighment
03*n
03I'll call Belle Tire first, if it's cheap enough I'll go there
yes Link, it's me
lol
now i'm sleep for real
6they have alignment under the suspension...I dunno if they consider that the same
XD
6but yeh, call belle first
6you should be fine
12XD
12orlynao
03OK
03LOL
6it's when they say "CHECK IMMEDIATELY" when there's a problem
03XD
03well of course it's not going to say anything
6example, one of my engine belts had cracks in it, a lot of them
03I doubt 2000 SUVs have a way to tell if the wheels aren't aligned
03the only thing it shows is low fuel and low oil
03well, it has that panel that shows like, how many mpg you're getting, etc
6I don't think there are cars that tell you alignment
03yeahj
03-j
03prolly not
6that's not something the cars keep track of
6I've got a 91 toyota camry
6lovely little crapcar
ok
03automatically
6yeah
03sounds like a tr2ap though
03-2
did you know that 80% of Camrys sold since 1991 are still on the road?
6IT'S A TRAP
03and the other 20% had brake failure and killed their owners? :D
/me hides
I like them
03I personally do not have a problem with japanese cars
03just that after the whole Toyota brake failure incident I'd rather not
we had one as a rental when our Highlander was being fixed, and it was nice
03though
6the only issue I've ever had with mine is a notorious issue camrys in my year had
it was a 2003, I think
/me 12shot
03that being said
6most cars had it, just from how the frame was built
We used to have a 1987 Honda Civic
03OL
03*LOL
Mercury Mountaineer or whatever
03yeah
032000 model
k
6SUBURBANS
6no more
I drive a Geo Metro most of the time
03*XD
03rofl Geo
6needs to be said
IKR?
6also
03you know
Chevy, but with a different badge
03for some reason
6there are only two cars that make me rage
:3c
03the name just makes me laugh
6one of them I knew made me rage
I like Oldsmobile.
6it's just ridiculously stupid
03I actually have some pictures of it on my computer
03for kicks
then again i like most cars before 1990
03LOL OLD CARD
03*CARS
03I like the Oldsmobile Bravia or w/e it is
6but then I saw one that's just as bad imo
:3c
Bravada.
03yeah that
I'd like a Bravada.
03Bravada was pretty nice
03then again the Mountaineer is more or less thes ame thing
6http://en.suzukiclub.cz/graphics/gallery/full/424_sidekick.jpg
IDK why they had to hide the rear support pillar
except from a different company altogether
03that looks just like the Geo Tracker ror w/e it is
03*or
it is
03as much as i hate Kia
1991 and 1993
03it looks pretty epic
6the suzuki sidekick
suzuki sidekick = geo tracker
6they're weird, but there's one in town that is painted a hideous magenta color
03I haven't
03my friend is a mechanic
6I want to blow it up with a grenade
03but it looks cool
03but eh
03I really do like the way the 2000 model Mountaineers/Ford Explorers look
basscar?
6there's enough of those as it is
03*also
03MB?
Agreed with NS
or Gl
03LOL
12MB= Mercedes-Benz
03dude
03my SUV has tons of bass
03the entire back half
03is subwoofers
03it's amazing
but they're expensive =
*=\
Mercedes Benz
03you play Eiffel 65 on there
03and you can't even hear the words
03and this is with the bass at 50%
03put it at 100%, ears = shot
6lol
03:D
12I just hate spelling Mercedes-Benz xD
03and yeah, Mercedes is like stupidly overprice
03d
03they haven't had the Benz in their name in... 10 years maybe?
03it's just Merceds
03*es
03did you know
uh
no
12Nope, did not know
it's still Mercedes-Benz
People just say Mercedes because it's easier
03it's still *formally* called that, but all the dealerships just say Mercedes
6not that I'm much for flashy cars, I really like the Saleen S7
proper people call it Mercedes Benz
6</random>
03?
03also hm
03you know wha tI want to find
/me runs
6its own
03something that replaces the cigarette lighter (as EW SMOKING) but protects the poewr outlet
03but yet
6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saleen_S7
03it's next to impossible to find
03not sure why
the truck we used to have
03that's pretty nice
03well yeah
03mine has two outlets
03one is by the radio
03and has the lighter
03the other just has a cap over it
yeah same
03I'd like to ditch the lighter though
we sold that truck recently though
lrn2not punch things
03I said bump
03not punch
03but yeah
bumping
punching
what's the difference
03:/
Mmmmmm Saleen S7
/me waits on the key-fob to arrive
03as mine completely broke
03and I hate having to turn the key
Somebody knows a good American supercar =D
03good american supercar
6lol
12As for cheap SUVs, I really like the Jeep Patriot
key fobs are interesting
03EW
6naturally, I'm the same
03My friend told me the Mustang sucks
6but I grew into other cars too
03like as far as how it's built
6LOLNO
6well
03well
03he said
6preferences
Mustang is good, but I'd say it's a little overrated
03the rear axel is in a fashion that
03will wear itself down over time
old
03yeah, which is totally not safe
axle
03I kinda like SUVs, even though they suck for gas mileage
03just because I like high-off-the-ground vehicles
07lol
03sedans are like, I'm worried a truck is going to run me over
6 8D
03yeah, you have me to thank for that :P
xD
03SUVs?
12XD
03ah
03k
07lol
07same happened to me
03I had a friend in the UK reciord me a bunch of them off BBC
07my dvr crapped out
03and my hard drive died
03o.o
03BBC America?
it's pretty much like a go cart without a lot of body panels
I agree
I really hate the American version
07ya
03oh
03k
03I did that once
03but I don't have that station in HD
03so it's like fricking tiny
03so I just had my UK friend record them XD
03I really need to find the episode again where they had Anne Robinson as a guest
03that was kinda funnyh

03earlier today
03I accidentally pulled in the wrong driveway for a place
03was like
I liked driving our truck because it was extended cab
03hmm, I could go back on the 50mph main road and go in the next entrance, or just drive over the curb
03you can't do that in a minivan
it had "seats" but I just used the back as storage
03woah

and o_O
I copypasta'd it from my old topic lol
12I told them to check last year's invoice, they said "We checked it and you paid £240" and I was like WTF
12I told them to check it again because I KNOW I paid £120
12and they said "Ok well we can offer that to you again" >v>
._.
that's expensive o_O
you're running TST on a VPS amirite?
Because shared hosting seriously just DOESN'T get up to £120
12No
12It's shared
/me confusedface
oh
12and GOOD shared hosting does
There's lot of good shared hosting out there
that doesn't cost that much D:
12In the UK?
12I know I can trust this host to run my site's databases properly
12I've been to countless others that don't, it's really hard to find shared hosting that can run databases smoothly
12The only problem is this host's support >v>
I HATE hosting support
and live support is NEVER online
12lol, this lot get back to you but they never get it right XD
rofl
one of my friends
had to provide their credentials again
because the hosting company accused them of fraud
heh, shared hosting support is often worse than VPS hosting

/me is mad that his Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is derpin'
Didn't like the way we did something or other. XD
I ended up arguing with him for about 2 hours about fanfiction and how it can be good,
and in the end he showed me one of his favs and I made him read mine.
I picked a really good one for mine
and when he got to the end he said: The ones that are good need to spend their time writing a book or something"
*headdesk*
Lawl.
3 sucks
06i read that as RTCW
Why is there a house beside my name?
the train design for the Giga coaster is terrible
Atari mentioned on their forum that they're highly considering a 4th one

06i read things about touhou
06i tried to download the games
06and saw some videos
13and somehow Great Catfish isn't right at the bottom of the list when I don't even know anything about that character >>;
6yeah I hate that they added the dolls and the fish and everything
/me hides behind AE
6lol why are people scared of her
06that creeped me out a bit
06yesh
06i didn't play it
06YET
6angel, I can say I learned about her first, but NOT BECAUSE OF HER SONG 8D
06downloading the first 12 now...
06and yes
06the song
06xD
6that's how 99% of people find out
06mmhmm
6I actually found out about it through bad apple
06but i like Mojou's theme for some reason
6*mokou
6but didn't think anything of it
faaaaaling asleep
they said it costs $65 at the most
06same here
I first found touhou when i didn't
06bad apple, by Xi was kinda epic
6sounds about right drf
Bad Apple is redundant
<lightumbreon> bad apple, by Xi <-- I had that in my Opposite Day Special XD
/me hides
06xD
6and them saying at most, I don't think it'll actually be that expensive
$65? That's nothing. O__o
yeah
06so if touhou is allowed on RN...hehehehe
they said it takes like 45 mins
06i know just the right song :P
and apparently that's for both the back and front wheels
lu, piano version of UN Owen or gefo
*gtfo
6....OH LOL I forgot I actually finished my coic last night
06also
:p
06its nice
no way
13I like UN Owen Was Her, but imo it's a bit overrated |D
13I mean
6mokou's theme is amazing
06^
13I like it, but it's not one of my favourites
6and +1 to angel there
well I don't give a crap about touhou, I only like that song, and only the piano version
zzzz

06to MP3
if they don't have a download link
6I didn't realize it actually PASSED 5
06yes
I yell at the uploader

6...
6you just said you do it for music lol
13Lol sound quality
6anyways though
either way, I use DownloadHelper if I want, you know, actual videos

or PM the uploader
Music being like Trolol or the fun house theme
which usually works

0ok
02LOLOLOL, the last one

6SOMEHOW
6and yeah
4Scootaglue
6but considering that was my first time fighting her
6I think I did alright :>
13I hate having such a good run, and then dying to stupidity at the end D:

02It's just Impossible to me ._.
/me tries again, with reimu
0well...

05ESPEON FACE
0I rest my case.
4Oh, there was an odd thread last night
4on Ponychan, on /oat/
13:3
4"Cutting Up the Ghosties" was the title
4Needless to say I took offense
0 0_o
0mfw
6ufo is enragingly hard for me
12espeon face
13also on CtC I noticed that once you've 1cc'd it once, it's a lot easier to do it again on the other paths you can take
12that technology hasn't been made yet
13since only the first 3 stages are different |D
6yeah but the bullet styles are different
6based on which path you take
:D
4Then he made another topic and called it "Slicing Up the Ghosties." That one was taken off /oat/
0lol
13The only bullet pattern I've noticed to be different is Youmu
4This emoticon :D should really be XD
6well, I'm talking more for the first 3 stages
05Scientists need to create Espeons and Umbreons
13Ah yeah
8best kick ever
13not that difficult though
HA.
6no it's not
6but if you're used to one style and switch to another
0I gotta say that was good.
6it's hard
0Can mods kick mods?
Dunno.
8yes, but we dont except in certain circumstances
I think ops can kick ops.
8also
0only one way to find out...
6she takes on reimu's standard slower + more rang for...path 3 I think?
Unless protected mode is on.
0LAST MOD STANDING WINS
6on normal? o.o

6Silly polar can't talk now.
No more egg image for you Polarfire.
ha.
The worst thing that could happen is you get attacked by a botnet probably.
Especially if security is sub par.
4How likely is that to happen to us?
05!umbreon
/me still belongs to Espeon for 11 more minutes
0thankyou
8not likely, considering we have dari
05Lol
[!umbreon vars reset]
That depends on wheter or not we get on anypony's bad side.
You don't have to do anything to get on people's bad side. :P
Sometimes botnets just turn up randomly.
XD
That's something I didn't consider
The possibility of being attacked once we get into full swing once Season 2 starts
/me 0has returned with knowlege
05!espeon
Anything we're likely to get attacked by we should be able to handle.
Do we have backups?
I dunno
0that's how I found the eggface
Whatever it is Sprinks was talking about

Well, considering we'd be on our own server or whatever, it would be easy to fix.
/me ragequits
/me rages rages rages
Actually, own server makes it harder to fix.
...lawl
Because it'd be easier to DDoS the server.

Unless we want to fork out money.
:P
02I had like 6 lives with reimu
We are a nice part of the community, and recognized
0me and 7 mods is fun
02> 4th Stage
We'll definitely be huge
02I got of it with 1 live and 0 bombs
02> ragequited
Oh, yeah.
13Which bullet type were you using?
How well do you think we can defend against attacks, dari?
02The first one.
13If you were using homing amulets, that stage should be really easy xD
13Well not easy
13but easier
13and fun
02yeah, I know
02Still...
02> Silly Mistakes
8he/she is on the "contact us" page now
4New mod?
02I said like: Hi bullet, how are you today. do you mind if I run into you?
8yeah
4Won't there be someone else to replace the other lost mod?
8probably
/me still rages
4Yeah
6whats annoying is getting through an entire apttern
13It's basically just a stage filled with streaming bullets
6pattern
For the moment, we can defend against pretty much any attacks.
13just be ready to deathbomb if you make a mistake xD
We're missing mods?
/me also got waaaay to used to deathbombing in IN
02;-;
02I hate you, Mokuo.
13I used to be like that
Yes, I am.
13then after playing things like MoF where you're given no time to deathbomb at all
6...I need the slowpoke image.
6Now.
8silver, you missed that whole thing?
0On it!
8spike and twilight both stepped down
8on the same day, actually
13then again, sometimes I have these annoying moments
Spike did? Wow
13where I can clearly see a bullet about to hit me
13but for some damn reason
13I don't click the bomb button
13.w.
8yeah
8it was bad too
I'm actually glad Twilight's gone, but Spike was pretty cool.
4Bad?
Really? No shit.
6i hate that lol
0plot twists abound
8he was really upset and stressed about everything
4o.o wow
4He must have been really, really upset

0^
4You haven't been on Ponychan long have you, dari?
0what was the deal with "lemon injuring himself"
4Lemon said he was going to go away or something after his Rainbow Dash toy came in the mail
The best damn thread Ponychan ever had.
4Over 1000 posts
4Even if his intentions were pure
0wow
8wasnt that how he got permabanned from the site?
8i forget his exact name
4Lemon was permabanned?
4Why?
8no no
4He was right in his very first post though
4At least, I agreed with it
4But yeah
4It spilled out into a debacle over on /meta/
4I'm sure he's probably permabanned
4numerous times in that same thread
4just to take jabs at the mods
6*was doing something*
6*looks back*
How long have you been on it for?
6*sees this discussion*

Lol
I see.
0Is is soon yet?
4Are you sure?
Interesting how that phrase came to be, now that I looked it up
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/35713320.html
6Announcements are fun.
Sure thing
hai luna
Heya
How're you?
I need to go back to OOt3D
0hooray
8PONIBOORU, Y U NO LOAD FASTER?!
yes you should
/me runs
6PM? But that's when I practice in the debate team. ;P
4"Best" is purely subjective
http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=35k8p74&s=7
For Hip :3
That's awesome
0Speedy mod round... like 30 I think... GO!
13I quite enjoy Derpy.
Take best to mean most popular. Rainbow Dash is best pony.
Derpy is second best pony.
8sigh
and yeah luna :3 I've tried to get a pic featured in there mag for years
8fuck this picture
4And I thought Fluttershy was most popular pony
0shame shame guys...
Lies and slander.
8derpy is a good pony, but rainbow dash is best pony
11eeyup
11shame
Maybe that's the way to get it in then :P
0Even Dari fell behind on that one.
Dari kind of tunes out. Atleast last night
13DERPY IS BEST PONY.
I don't say many people use that name, they'd recognize it if they saw it probably
from 2005 xD
when I commented originally I mean
Laaaate
8i told sathi we might start the interview early and she said thats fine, she'll be here
0Anybody?
8so as soon as i find some pics we can start
0nope he's back.
4It's more than 20% cooler
8yeah
/me giggles softly
8i think twilight and applejack had the most
Lol, my least favourite ponies.
Have most screentime.
8and dash and fluttershy had the least
8iirc
4Twilight is the main protagonist though
8hey, i like twilight
4It makes sense that she has the most screentime
idklol
0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
13Aren't we supposed to be doing something?
Have I missed an interview? sorry about the lateness, my mother's just got home from a while away and we've had some important shit to discuss
0Is it PARTYTEIM?
4Yeah, we'll begin shortly
You're back just in time
Join us in the interview room

0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
8yeah
...
10or are we letting him attempt to explain his absence
8he said last week was the first time in 4 years it happened
:D
10hm
I should have a script.
4We just can't
10just saying in case it's not him that's not reliable and it's actually just his hardware
10I mean I'm just trying to play devil's advocate here, don't shoot me :D
0can you check?
4We can't afford to have him not show up for a BMN because of faulty hardware
10anyone can spontaneously get shitty hardware out of nowhere :P
6Yeah, he's out for sure
Yeah.
10alrighty then :D
I'll check my log.
0:3
Did you log the debate from last night? :P
0see how many times I've been kicked today if you don't mind.
I log everything. :P
Today you've been kicked 33 times.
0lol
0and turni don't go there. Its too early.
0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
Never too early.

Seems like Polarfire has a bad case of "nothing to do today"
0SPEEDY MOD # 30 SOMETHING! GO!
13xD
I think Polarfire was born with that ailment
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaqC5FnvAEc

4Alright, hold on
0lol
oh k
0mind if I ask how the interviews are going?
10alrighty
>implying you would have wanted to see any at all. :P
0Well in that case...
0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
8well... yeah dari
4http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=zja0yg&s=7
0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg
10hah
13Why did I click on that.
4Who's giving the interview?
0http://www.nomad4ever.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/egg_on_the_face.jpg
4Sure
12hi drf
Goodevening / afternoon
13Indeed. Good Afternoon. =D
4Hello, Sathi
Hey Sathi.
Hello all,
0hmm.
13nope
13xP
4Are you ready?
/me nods
4To begin, that is
4Alright
0http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/4b9b58a37f8b9a3667640600-401-305/egg-on-face.jpg
I'm busy now. :P
Nyan
0Did you write a script for that image XD
0or were you just being speedy
In the interview, that is
Doh. Do we talk about the answers in here?
8yes
0Is is soon yet?
Yep, we deliberate in here
As in experience or any other benefits?
4Both
Well experience is a benefit. O_o
4Whatever you can offer us
Yup.
xD
Well as I stated in the application form I have already experience as moderator / teamleader / projectleader
May have to f5
Later.
xP
I'm a teamplayer and I know how to deal with feedback.
It was.
10oh, brilliant
A long while back.
Gonna ask about the project leader bit, if you guys don't mind
10that's proof of a good brainstormer's mind ;P
Go for it.
Oh nice.
10I think that's a good idea
8yeah, she's been asking about it for a few weeks
4Could you explain the "project leader" bit? It implies that you were doing more than just overseeing operations and moderating.
I just put it in now since I remembered about her asking, actually.
/me awake now
that's correct but that's regarding my real-life occupation
0oh... all the mods got busy at once and now I can't get kicked anymore :(
03xD
Sneas, as long as it uses an ethernet cable you'll be ok :D
03I hope
Also sorry for not responding to PMs yesterday D:
03Linux isn't listed as supported on their site
03It's ok xD
Hmm of course. I just don't want to brag or anything
0haha.
My modem is also a (wireless) router
but
it sucks
i.e. no upnp
:?
10Is it worth saying that Sathi should be able to say anything, and that we'll understand it as not being bragging, since of course this is an interview
* :/
It means companies could hire me for projects. First I would write a business case, recruit a team and when the business agrees start the project
03On the upside
as uverse is a fucking lot of money
Not at the moment.
0:(
10alrighty :)
Right, she should be showcasing her achievements and abilities
03Leave? o.o
:D
10yeah i just think it's the one time that showing off is credible, you know
huh?
But again, I'm not expecting to be displeased during the questions. It's the pictures part that concerns me
Yeah
Is that enough details for you?
03Are you moving out?
Oh
well, i'm going to college
:P
8i actually liked the fact that she said it
8shows she can stay humble
i mean, uverse is like, the best for home servers
although i hate AT&T with a passion
happened to be across the street from the tire place
Not just yet
10well it shows that she has a clear mind on the significance of the interview process, sure
Same.
lol
03Oh D:
03xD
yeah... i'm 3 hours away
03D:
i may get a UPC
10hah
Whatevs, nothing wrong with emphasizing it
03o:?
...Oo
Bad reputation?
Bad rep?
10O.o
Wut
This intrigues me
that way i don't have to give a fuck if the power goes out :P
10although it's probably not appropriate to discuss now
Ask for elaboration? Oo
10we should probably stay on track
I thought about that
13If you don't mind me asking, Bad Rep? I don't recall seeing this anywhere.
/me has returned
This is... kinda important.
We'll discuss later
We have a bad reputation...?
And we need to know her source on it.
Fuck
10after the interview maybe?
Oh well
13Ah. Ignore that.
^ i should really change that lol
10lol
8no, this is the appropriate time to ask about it
Well, we need to know where she's getting this info anyway.
WE HAVE TO GO FORWARD
yes you should
GET TO IT BOY
/me shot
4No, please explain
03XD
13Or. Explain.
06good times
Get to it Chooooooooooooop chop chop
03I hate the power company here too
/me shot again
I'M SORRY.
XD
:/
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384373202.png
Well, the thing is, it is important to hiring her.
ning
03They also like charging an arm and a leg for it too
apparently Best Buy is their own ISP
We might as well find out now
We need to know how she found this out.
OH DERP THERE GOES THE POWER
LETS WAIT THREE HOURS BEFORE TURNING IT BACK ON
etc
10alright, I suppose
8i want to find out because it can give us an example of how she can handle situations like this
yeah same hre
here
03Well one day it randomly went off for like 4 hours
LOL DRf said best buy instead of WorstBuy XD
Oh.
Lol.
8that one night with starship troopers...
that happens too
back in 2001
er
I know
mmo-champion...
2004
10don't underestimate mmo-champion
we lost power for two weeks
I thought she meant bad reputation due to something more personal than technical.
10it's ginormous
Oh, I know.
^ fucking hate that
._.
Yeah, I was thinking more personal grudges as well
03Wow D:
I'm saying that they expect a lot of everything and anything there.
13http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384376080.png
13cry
Or understandable at least
13;-;
but on the other hand, I believe ponies and these movie nights is a hobby of all of us? I'll just keep trying to promote the european night more.
some parts of charlotte lost it for like
03I think the power bill's like $130 something a month
I do agree with the childish comment, at times.
8how do you deal with those people?
that's the price of uverse
total
i think
LOL D-
03Wow
03xD
i mean
phone = phone, can't really suck too bad
but the tv servicd
it's their opinion, which I respect, but the friends that tuned in actually enjoyed the show.
what's the interview room again?
Well, you're gonna get that when you're catering to more than one person
BronyStateInterview
and it's slow
:(
hm.
03D:
it says that's not right
"No such channel BronyStateInterview"
but i hardly watch the tele anyway, that's my dad's thing
lol
*shrugs* ?
#bronystateinterview
You have to put # in front of the channel name
Poor AE :<
lol'd.
06I guess I'll join in, http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384378723.png
I did it right the first time as well
I like that she's been promoting for us.
/me pets AE
momentary derp.
No, it's not.
Alright, well, Hip, are you ready to move on to the pictures?
adfhjsdjfol;sdk;fl
/me jelous
I put it for the 6 PM showing of the eps.
Alright, go ahead
8does anyone have any other questions before i move on?
Oh.
13Share some of that with meeee D:
06but that was a while ago
I play mmos... just haven't been able to.
8ok, we're gonna move on to the 2nd part of the interview
well yeah, either way
IMO at least
Greedy
8im going to show you 3 pictures
it's a real clincher
I can't play wow anymore.
at least
06I would if I could but for now
/me cling =w=
Too.
Much.
8any questions?
13!espeon
Redundancy
Eugh.
ok bring it on :)
I've not looked back
I like the confidence.
hah
I did as well
8ok, 1st pic: http://oi55.tinypic.com/zja0yg.jpg
as did i
same xD
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384381535.png Mine ;;
Hope she doesn't screw up
13Better than mine :<
I find it comfortable to do in here
You want me to react with a personal reaction or how it should be done according to the rules?
Ooooh, she knows the rules
10postan teal
6So I actually like when everypony uses their color in here.
8how would you react as a mod?
10ghosties I think it should be assumed that anyone with a decent enough level of intelligence to get mod has read the rules :P
;3
6You would think
4You'd be surprised...
10just my 2 cents, it shouldn't be a 'good' point, just a required point dude.
Well this is NSFW and I do not know which audience is attending the movie nights. I would either PM or ask the person the stop posting these images as we might have young viewers attending the show too
10and I said "to get mod" not 'to apply for mod' :P
4...
.. Once it loads
8meh answer
6*shrug*
4Yeah, meh
8ok, 2nd pic: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/166cec130ee0ff62399f05414d8aa064/34397%20-%20artist%3ARayo%20flank%20Flankylicious%20plot%20Trixie.jpg
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384385396.png
She'll have to be a little more... Aggressive. Just a tad bit.
o_O
06I like how we have the same ping
6Nopony's ever aggressive enough, though.
06almost
4RBD was
6True.
4He was the first actual assertive person we had
13D:
10I was brutal, my bad. I get angry when people abuse environments such as this
XD
My connection is on wireless and I'm away from the router
AND I DCED
FUU
4We wanted professionalism
Lmfao
Dont blame WLM again :P
Nah
4...it's not about being okay with it, Sathi. It's about being professional
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384387189.png
13Also
XD
13I'm right next to our router
13.w.
8another meh answer
4Exactly
13We've had a crappy ISP for the longest time
8at least she said she would consult the mods though
Luna is worse
lol
And whee
8ok, last pic: http://oi53.tinypic.com/35k8p74.jpg
My dad's argued about ours for a very long time
2.0MBPS
We pay for 3Mb/s
1.0 now
GO WIRELESS z.z
0anybody here?
I pay for 2MBs
And never get even half of it
6We're a bit busy.
6Yeah, likely.
CLICK
*
He got in a fight with them once
10why did I open it again.. you guys scarred me enough as it is the first time...
0Mod business?
6It really shows if they know our rules.
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384389276.png
6Possibly~
ban*
6Maybe we're just ignoring you~
XP
10i think dari does have a point
hey, it's all on Verizon =P
06someone I know in sweden has
06it's just disgusting
06that's how fast it is
06xD
10but again I made sure that I had read up on the exact wording of the rules, as to be properly prepared for my interview
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384390435.png
8its about their judgement
10it just made me feel more secure in my personal judgement
06>better than 77% of BM
06what
And my upload should be 80 >.>
LOL
Tes
Yes
4Bad answer
/me 0begins to doubt his very existence, spiraling into a bout of depression and self pity at the realization that the mods may be ignoring him because they don't like him.
6*twitch*
06BDA, BAD
06Punny
4She's basically saying "I'd give a little slap on the wrist"
06:<
Hah
Yes
:<
10She's indecisive
Needs to be more aggressive.
10I think
4Indecisive and not nearly assertive
10Yeah but dari we give content warnings
10what if someone posted that during Up!
8shes a bit passive
4Exactly, we let people know before hand and right before we show the movie
Well she said maybe you should have content warnings on links.
8but i still want to hire her
6She's a little passive, but I still say yes.
0Hello? Sathi? Anybody? D:
8definite yes for me
4...She needs more training
4but sure
13http://www.speedtest.net/result/1384391912.png
If she can be a little more assertive I'll agree. Yes.
4True
8no one is completely ready
AE wins ;D
8exactly dari
AE?
8any opposition to hiring her on the spot?
all our activies
American Eagle
6I'd say on the spot.
...
I was kidding
no
lol
13LOL
4Hah, how ironic that last post was by her
JL is slow!
how was I supposed to know that?
6...oh wow.
10That was good
4Well, for one
4She's a girl
You live in america?
/me shot
13Also, my speakers are picking up weird radio signals again
10I don't get that
10at all
Angel Espeon
13some silly opera thing
lol
/me facepalms
Turret Opera?
4I mean, yeah, I'm joking
4Still
13Nope unforunately |D
4Different perspectives would be nice
10alright >.<
13I wish we at least picked up DECENT radio signals for a change >>
8its good to have diversity in moderators to cover possible groups that could be offended
6So. Votes on hiring her on the spot?
8but in any case
6I vote yes.
4Right
8yes
Oh just doesn't anyone want her hired on the spot? :P
4...Yes
Or*
We have decent radio here
XD
4I've been saying "that is" a lot today -_-
0http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/180/1/a/pinkamina_diane_pie_by_onemansociety-d3kgh08.jpg
Agreed.
10I don't feel like I'm in a comfortable enough position to give a definite answer yet, only an opinion. The opinion being that she needs to be shown the ropes I guess
[21:46] <Ghosties> To begin, that is
/me 0mumbles
4We're not just gonna say YOU'RE IN, and that's it
13It disturbs me how my computer randomly picks up random radio signals in the first place >>
4She'll be appropriately trained
10I know. That's why it's hard for me to make a decision. I've still been here less than a week :P
13I've had french radio signals before
8welcome to the team
0I can get along just fine. FINE SEE? I"M FINE!!
4But
0HAHA!
4You'll need to be trained
4Somewhat
6...you're not as fun as I was when I was left alone.
8yes
0THERE'S NOTHING WRONG HERE
6You're not quite strict enough on the images...
0plenty of fun, see? plenty of fun.
0always plenty of fun...
4You're not nearly assertive
8really the main thing we need to train you on is the policy on R34 and gore
4But we can work on this
0see? plenty of fun.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHPhxnW6Ti4 this is somehow beautiful
0I'll show them.
13Indeed. Just a bit more assertive. Though a welcome addition.
8ok, lets let her say something now guys XD
10I guess congratulations are in order then :)

6Now comes the TRULY hard part.
8i also want to make sure you know a few things
6: D
/me 0mumbles
:'D
humm
0I don't need them.
0ha.
0HAHA.
/me 10has the best colour
8first of all, we need you to be reliable and available
4Definitely
4We realize that you're a Euro mod now, but prudence is very important
0hehehehehehehehe
8we can do that later on though
hi Angel
^
8but basically we know that you're going to be here for the movies
10okie dokie lokie
4Right, it's important that you're around for the BMNs
8but we hold pretty frequent meetings throughout the week as well
MY GMAIL IS UNAVAILABLE
WADDAFU
6lawl
13LOL
4Oops, sorry Hip. Go ahead
Well I can put em in my agenda if i'm informed on time :)
13Now the signals are playing some kind of Asian chanting song or something >>;
8next thing, we need to make sure you know the policy on the R34 and gore
I'll do it later when my gmail stops being dumb
...
LOL
okay
Hey AE
Come here
10sprinks, it's done
I htought it was creepy when they were playing that kind of music on a plane to Miami
but that's just weird
8with those first 2 pics, those would earn a person a warning kick
:)
6Basically, as far as the meetings go, if you're online just try to stop in here, just in case. A lot of them aren't announced ahead of time...
And no radio signals from overseas either
8but anyway
8pic*
8what do you mean?
8rule 34 is part of the "rules of the internet"
4Basically, if it exists there is porn of it
8it means "if it exists, there is porn of it"
Lawl.
13NSFW = Not Safe for Work.
4haha
You guys, repetition.
6This answer now comes in rainbow.
4Nah
8in this context, it means pornographic pics of ponies
4We need a blue
10lolling at explaining rule 34
as in ponies after dark..and such..
to*
8guys, just let me go through my thing for now
4Yes...I think
6And the ugly purple.
13Pornographic images of anything is not allowed.
13xD
Lawl.
8facehoof, dari
I am disappoint people.
7aww
8orange is fine
You can chagne the password at any time. :P
6imo
8eh
4*er, when a mod IS available
0They think I'm crazy...
0I'll show them.
I'm just trying to be more active on #SW, and as I say that my friend over here is trying to take the computer
brb
0I'll show them all.
0They'll see.
10Interesting
0They'll all see.
lol bye
0http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lklipc5UnM1qha245o1_500.jpg
8but anyway
12hi
8lets continue
10Ghosties, when you say rule 34, do you tend to include risque and suggestive material under that header?
03bbs
8the next thing is that we expect very professional conduct from our mods
4Yes
4If it's intentionally suggestive
03frick
8but
4Then it classifies as rule 34 in my book
10Because you should probably use another blanket word for it
03apparently it's more than just the steering being out of alignment
6>we
4Don't know about the other mods, but it does in my book
this is not working
03I'm gonna have to pay like $280 to fix it
hey NS
10well, I personally define rule 34 as porn.
12derp
8everything we say in the mod room stays in the mod room
10Like, don't get me wrong, I'd not allow suggestive material in stream, just saying I'd use another way to describe what's not allwoed
8also, this position can be very stressful at times
10exactly :D
8if you get frustrated or angry, make sure you vent in the mod room, not the public room
6Guys... we need to post as a rainbow this week.
6Like, in color order.
7yea that's common knowledge.. we do-not want to make a wrong impression
then I realized how stupid that was
8exactly
8now
ok, back
WB~
I think it is
AND I WAS LIKE "WHA-"
10nope :P
ty
03Kyu, the tie rods
03or tire
03w/e
03they said I bent them
03to the point they can't just bend them back
6Well, it would still be in there.
... the axles?
03no
...
10it's not a seperate colour though
/me facepalms
10there's 6 colours :P
10in the rainbow anywya
10anyway*
4What are they?
7sounds fair to me
6(we haven't gotten yours in the mail yet)
4Blue, purple, yellow...
03think about it
03the axel turns, right?
03if you bend that
03LOL
7what do you mean?
6 7 in the rainbow
8ROY G BIV
4It's a joke
7ah
then the wheels bump
4YAY, I'm first! : D
0wow you guys are pretty good at ignoring.
03no
10buuut Indigo isn't a colour. it's all the church's fault :P
03the wheels would be moving in a circle
03and I mean like an up and down circle
yeah
8heres some commands you're going to use
But this is best rainbow anyway.
they're bumping up and down
6We're pretty good at being busy.
03right
03basically
0oh :(
they would also get closer together
03but wikipedia suggests tie rods
03but it's some metal thing
uh
okay
03that has to be replaced
8to kick, use "/kick [name] [kick message]"
10indigo is just blue-violet
03LOL
10it's like including all the tertiary colours, like red-orange
4You know, even though I think it'll be good to have Sathi on the team I can't help but feel like she'll be a buzzkill because she doesn't get our jokes
7in an irc client cant I just click the person name kick > fill in reason?
03so turning it accordingly I'm driving with them like / \
13Oh
oo
13Ignore the brackets when typing it out
13lol
haha
pizza
/me thinks of skiing
That looks fun
7I know ;)
Sathi: In mibbit I think you can probably do that, yeah.
How did you manage that?
the teachers are like "Do a pizza"
0well ok then
10I checked
0http://arch.413chan.net/Pinkie_Pie_-_Super_Happy_Face-%28n1298352139653%29.jpg
10I can't at least
03LOL Iskierka
03and Luna
03without realizing it
03went to back out
03with me wheel turned
me
03and apparently the wheel hit the post and shoved the thing
oh yeah
03the odd thing
drf
Ahaha
03is that it didn't even stop moving
03you'd think I would be like
03it backed out fine and then broke itself
03>_>
It's amazing how awesome ends with me and ugly starts with u ~(˚¬˚)~
/me runs
7ok
Well I can in mIRC.
03nothing's wroing with my tires

03he's a mechanic, I'm trying to see if he'll help me
4I know we're all mods here, and professionalism is completely key, but, having fun shouldn't be tossed out of the window
03as if he has the right suction cups or w/e, he prolly wouldn't charge me labor
lol
03The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) has commissioned a report that shows fair use industries play a huge part in the US economy. Fair use industries include software companies, to search engines, to news website, and not only do these industries contribute $4.5 trillion to the US economy, representing 17% of US GDP, they also employ 1 out of 8 Americans (and this is only 2009 figures).
03LOL

03LOL
8brb in about 10
7No I mean before I may use the full set of tools ;)
ie: "OMG DAEMON SPADE IS STRAIGHT!?"
8oh
YES HE'S STRAIGHT
6When we decide.
10Ghosties I sincerely apologise as truly as one can, and I deeply wish that I never accidentally call out the wrong name when we're sharing an intimate moment ever again.
4Depends on how comfortable we are
8whenever we feel like youre ready pretty much
7ok
6Usually doesn't take long.
DEAL
10<333
o.o
fanfictions
4CALL ME!
10I literally don't understand how i even did that
a lot of them are really really bad
6But, again, I need info for the About Us page from you, Sathi.
10not purple
'cause usually there's only a couple
03more like they're all bad
Lawl.
...
8ok, brb for realz now
Ahaha
6Confused?
but I try
7Yes i'll take a look and come up with something
6Nope.
10bai guise, see you tomorrowish
there's quite a few that are okay
but the majority are bad
and then there's the terrible ones
4Later man
6It's just area, favorite pony, favorite movie, and an image, Sathi.
anyway
7okidoki
I hope the quality's going back up 'cause that was really awful
6EGGS
6We are planning to.
7what's with the eggs O.O
That all depends on the fans
Sometimes you just gotta find a few good authors and stick to them
'ey
6Pretty much.
unfortunately I can't find many of them
4Yeah, pretty much
4For us, the mod
4s
and that's saying something
7ok
yeeeeeeeeeeeeah
I'm more interested in writing the stories anyway; it's okay
|D
4I suppose
03how do you do it though
and the main reason I write fanfictions instead of my own is because I'm bad at creating the characters
Do you participate it NaNoWriMo?
I tried
I had a really bad plot
Pony pasta...
Really?
'cause it was just that terrible
That's the fun of it though!

Metal Link'
6I'm talking to him now.
0lol. its ok.
7lies!
4Possibly, Sathi
7she did not
0while you were gone :D
4What are you gonna tell him? He missed three interviews
0no no its a good thing...
4We just can't possibly give him a fourth
You've been kicked 49 times.
6I told him we can't take him on right now if we don't know if he can be prompt.
7haha
0Dari you read my mind.
6I said maybe sometime down the line he can try again.
0I was just about to ask :D
4Good
Hahaha.
4We've got two mods in the last two weeks, we should be good for now
0 50 times.... What's the record?
I dunno.
OMG

Don't make me bring out the /akick
4Ah, I see

You don't want to know Polar.
You don't want to know.
06o.o
0Or do I? DUN DUN DUUUUUUNN
Pretty well; you?
7I think he does want to know, otherwise he did not ask :)
7now.. where's my glass
0oh. I thought it would auto kick me whenever I posted something...
0that would be cool
02:<
0Me and 5 mods... FASTEST MOD GO AGAIN!
6*doesn't care*
0:(
0but I'm only at 55.

aaaaw
/me hugs
4So he
yeah, those look difficult
0oh.

0I'll just stay away from that then.
02No, because I don't know how
oh
or
0Hey where did metal go? :(
6*shrug*
The akick I know auto kicks the user when they join.

6I must have been thinking of something else then, dari.
0the akick I mean
02I basically do the same
0Test it out on me...
02But since it's on GIMP I have to use my mouse instead of my pen
oh yeah
0but not for too long because I want to come back.

6And told him to try later.
0wow.
0*loneliness
4Sprinks, talk to him
4He's upset
6I already did.
4Talk to him again
6But I guess I'll try.
4He just emoted all over the main room
4He needs to be taken care of
ehmm.. how old is he?
4Don't know
6>imply age has to do with maturity
6Dari is 15. Oo
7yes exactly
6What. Evs.
:P
6^
4Are you talking to him, Sprinks?
6If he would talk back.
6I asked if he was okay and he just went "Yes?"
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131052250519.jpg
4After that little explosion in the main room, I don't think he's "okay."
4But, maybe that's just my assessment
0mods are asleep...
6>implying I ever sleep
7It might be me, but I do not see the explosion...
0http://www.webguild.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egg_face_google.jpg

0Can anybody do the honors?
Poke(u)r face
0Sprinkles?
7thanks for clarification
4No prob

6Gog, he's being a pain.
5What about now?
4And besides, after that little show of emotion, I don't think I want him to be a mod
4He's too emotional
6now I mean XD
6Oh, he won't.
6Nope.
6Neener.

0what I do?
7something with colours
0oh. I just wanted to get 2 more kicks is all :)
4Saved my PM with him as well
4On the one hand he could be telling the truth, on the other he could just be instigating drama
4I'm still here, just set my status to away for now. I'll be leaving shortly
4Sathi, don't tell anyone I'm still here
7I won't
4Thank you

/me still doesn't have TF2 :D
6DARI WHY?
/me 3doesn't have it neither :3
04Minus some spriting I need to do for a friend, writing my story and doing random other things that my family asks.
7Thank you.
6Polar, you have to go DEEPER.
04That's fine
7Espeon's busy then, and I've got to figure out Rora's schedule.
7It's a bit tough when people live on all vertices of the Earth (fallacy intended).
04Heh
7Me neither. >>
7Okay.
7Well, now a community game's a motivation for you.
4Brb, drawing Espeons
04I've still got about 13 chapters to go but LOL
04Yeah it is
6And dari, I believe you mean "For the enjoyment I anticipated after performing said activity"
04Games are always more fun when you play with friends - that's my main problem with ignoring Halo:Reach for several weeks.

7Indeed.

3and never get past chapter 2 :/
04That has happened to me several times.
6Oh, but I could.
6I just won't.
04Which is why I decided to accept May's offer of collaboration in order to motivate me to finish it.
13=D
02Why would I Quan?
3well, how do yuu motivate yuurself to continue?
02I don't know if I like it, or if it would run on my computer
04By giving myself a time limit.
3i definately can't

how can a rat pick up a vending machine
You just said playing touhou turns us into lunatics

brb
Not for anyone
Drf
drf
can I explain something to you
also to grab lunch at Boudin's
but anyway
they're looking around at clothes that he can wear
I'm looking around for clothes that I can draw |D
I should write this down.
uh
you want to explain something?
....
did I say explain
lol
well
1) I have no fashion sense
This is either a long story, or I'm not sure why she's talking to you
I'm not good at explaining things
it's actually part of my homework
explain things
she just said "drf can I explain something to you"
another part is to diagree with people o3o''
:D
which I'm not doing well
I don't :D
Lawl.
which is why it's my homework OLT
but anyway
2) all people I draw end up looking… honestly really really weird
