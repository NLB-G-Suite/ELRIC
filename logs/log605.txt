That's why people hate Twilight sooo muuuch
To be fair, I hate twilight because I actually read all 4 books. I have a basis for my hate, and actual experience to back it up.
I only saw the movies and went.. not horrible, not good
:);):D:P:$:O:|:S:[6_9:);):D:P:$:O:|:S:[6_9:);):D:P:$:O:|:S:[6_9:);):D:P:$:O:|:S:[6_9
Hey, just got in here, what's up next?

Hey spammer >.>

I don't hate that either- Dracula is more lame

I try to watch things before jumping on the hate bandwagon.

yes
wouldnt it be thee?
he's a daywalker
meh
I just... I didn't like that movie
as a kid that is, never seen it since
00,10Many of you have already asked but this week there was no survay or news letter sent out
00,10It comes partly from not having much time to get people set up in order to make one in time.
Man who's managing mod duties?
00,10That being said there is not much need for panice because we were not having a normal movie night next week any ways
Apparently :o
00,10Next friday-sunday we are showing lord of the rings extended cut.
Isn't...Ghosties in charge, or something?
00,10One movie per day.
Or is it like a collective thing?
Oh lord
I think its collective :P
:(
Dat wall of text.
YESSSSSSSS.
Extended cut. That's...three hours per movie, I think.
00,10might slip in some pony eps ^_^
We had a pony lottery last time LoTR night was done.
The are many equally shitty books out there
Yup.
11,01Yes, I did just take over stream.
Last time it was glorious.
I've never read a Twilight novel, but I attempted to watch one of the movies.
i have power
xD
For a film supposedly involving vampires and werewolves, it was deadly dull.
0,14More people
No, I mean, glorious how?
Because it'll be like a "look how far we have come" moment.
My point with Twilight as an example is that people tend to latch on to popular opinion more if they are negative
Besides, LotR is great.
After "1 movie every day"
Ooohkay.
00,10it might just kill me to do it but we have one more thing next week.
Maybe some pony eps slipped in, because he'll be streaming.
00,10JACKIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, ONE MORE THING!

Wasn't inuyasha for girls anyway?

When did the book come out?
11,01I enjoyed Rozen Maiden, and that's supposedly for girls.
Inuyasha is considered by many to be "DBZ for girls", yes. :p
Dunno
Anyway
The movie had pacing issues thereabouts
best moments of itnermission
I forget which ;p
Because that'll be the year I read it.
I'd consider Inuyasha "Twilight for anime fans"
Never watched DBZ, and loved watching Inuyasha x_x
After the initial conflict, everything else kind of felt low-key.
night guys
Like the battle should have been the climax.
i see a spear
I never got into anime- despite being heavily into japanese 90s music
You'll have to point this out to me on Thursday.
I enjoyed Nanoha and Madoka, and those were supposedly aimed at girls.
wat
Spoilers!
lol
indiana jones?
3rd one
If I'm here
Alrighty! Skip through the movie into the action scenes!!!!!

We join our movie already in progress
Nanoha, really?
AHAHahahahaHAHAHAhahahaAHAHahahaha
BEST INDIANA JONES MOVIE EVER!!!

Honestly I haven't been into anime that much anymore. Last one I liked was Shin-Chan when it first came on but kind of lost interest in it because the later episodes lacked the charm I had with the ones from the first season
well I guess that explains his fear of snakes
man, he wants to hurt a kid
