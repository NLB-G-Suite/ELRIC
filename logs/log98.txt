10tl;dr I've never grown out of being a lazy kid
/me has never played any of the Zelda games all the way through, he's only played Ocarina of time part way through*
10well, maybe not lazy, but not caring about the future at least
10one of the by-products is laziness
Windwaker!
All the Zelda games had their pros and cons but I really loved WW.
That's exactly the opposite of me
I guess it's, itself, a biproduct of being in a family of people with ruined lives and being thought of as the last beacon of hope
10I'm the last beacon of hope
Damn the boats!
10for my family at least
Aye....
10everybody in my family is kinda in ruin at the moment financially, and trying desperately to pick themselves up
10my sister was hopeful, but she messed up her first year of uni, re-took it and then had a child and had to drop out
10so it's all on me ;D
hey
10exactly
hihello
10you're taking it sensibly and seriously, and every step of the way I'm -just- scraping through and trying to make it as enjoyable as I can on my way
Too seriously maybe, and that's probably why stories like these depress the crap out of me
Now that I remember I think the first time I realized this really was when I turned 10
if i get the booster 0.8, i have to reset to access sanctuary, correct?
Suddenly it struck me, "Whoa, my age isn't in the single digits anymore"
10ha really?
Yep
Yep
10I can't really remember anything that far back
10but those fears were silly and short-lived, he's still the best friend I've ever had :P
I know how you feel, I think everyone's had that fear before
You get 2.0 if you don't take 0.8
10I guess I did that, but not by choice

It's a mistake I'm pretty sure everyone does on their first try if they don't read FAQs or something
10well, I turned 17 in the holidays between moving from boarding to normal schoo

I dropped out of my master's course, it was stupid
10aahhhh
10well that's just lame :/
wow, a textbook still being written
10ha
hope the tests weren't a moving target, too!
I didn't need the credits either
No tests, only research papers
I might have to go back for a master's at some point, but right now I'm hardly motivated enough to get my certs
Not much
Oh lol yep, I messed that up

Mods asleep. Post something other than ponies.
Post !ponies?
lol
Mods aren't asleep, we're watching you right now.
Dang.
>.>
:p
you can't keep me from not posting ponies!
http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/Mods2.jpg
I was only stating that we aren't asleep, not that you can't post something that isn't about or has ponies.
mods never sleep
I was joking about that one pic.
abusing free wifi ftw
Mods asleep, post ponies.
Haha
But in here, it would be the opposite.
Mods asleep, post something not pony related.
Just replace all nouns with ponies and you're good to go.
and how are you two today?
Doesn't work.
10<3
?
/me 10is great either way
yeah
Painting Ponies with my Pony in paint tool Pony
Man
Maybe if you also replace all verbs with ponies.

That rainbow dash comic really brought me down

10wasn't sure whether to link the studio version or the live version, but that should do :P
Hmm
Anyhow, I need to pony or I shall pony and you'd all be ponied of my pony....how's that?
That's a good song
You missed a few nouns and verbs.
Not much my style, but I have shit taste
replace everything with pony
Pony, pony pony pon pony.

10Not my style either really, but Incubus can really play anytihng
there you go

ung....THIS comic
I'm sorry, I don't buy it
Yeah val, that comic.
it's playing too much on trying to be sappy
ironic that they used music from UP
come on, has anyone ever speculated that she might NOT be cut out for the wonderbolts?
and that maybe she has to...I don't know...WORK for it?
/me rages
>implying she isn't working for it
I wouldn't be surprised if they actually pull that one in one of the episodes
she just sits there waiting for it to happen!
she doesn't even DO her regular job!
yes she does, she just procrastinates.
and she only likes showing off to people
let's not forget the whole "I am in no way a team player"
http://youtu.be/KoLCOc3lo6E?t=4m33s
10valthejean be crazy :D
well, that's why these things now tick me off
seriously, >implying the comic implied she didn't have to work her rump off
yeah sorry, but based on the extremes I've seen with RD fans, I doubt it
to GGgala that is
...huh?
Due to the group breaking up
and sure, if they develop her into a CHARACTER as opposed to a Mary Sue then sure
I'd be all for it
I meant fans like the creator of the comic
You're complaining about the fanon RD, not the canon RD.
the canon RD still has a lot to learn and a lot of flaws to fix through multiple seasons
pretty much
though my only problem with canon RD is that the writer's never actually have her learn anything
which isn't a character issue more than a writing issue
and no, I don't read fanfics
period
well I'd be fine with that
I certainly don't HATE RD
other than "she's drawn vewwy vewwy pwetty"
She looks cool, that's all.
She's laid back and doesn't afraid of anything.
That's how people see her.
prince-dari's probably asleep then.
I'm back
I assumed as much
Probably not
I DID
>dari's asleep. trash Rainbow Dash
:D
ouch
10XD
<34
<3*
10<3 naawwh it's a fair point
nothing
lol
well see, I view those kind of fanons a bit differently
as they actually have air time

:U
http://themetalvinylproject.deviantart.com/#/d47s961
^comic^
isolated in terms of plot maybe
lol
but the characters definitely progress
just look at Fluttershy
you like?
Dungeons of dredmor
over the course of the season, she becomes more and more "assertive"
until it finally explodes when she goes a bit TOO far
Never played it myself
She actually shows her darker side.
I'm really questionning Rarity's position in the bottom three.
Yeah, that's a good point
there was a thread on ponychan about this I really liked
Unless it's for Mac, I'm afraid I can't get it
wine~
basically, they came up with this medical term
Also don't forget that RD has had the least screen time out of the mane six
Well, if it works on that
I lol'd at that comic and I don't know why.
I.E Fluttershy scaring animals, or Pinkie losing friends
yeah
SillyNilly|Sketch: Because you can? :3
which essentially causes them to have literaly breakdowns
wow my grammar
Yes!
but you get the point :P
That's how I call these moments.
t'was an interesting read
Huzzah! People like the comic
because it's a very captivating world building idea
I already posted it to Bronies.memebase
Like.... submission >_> thing
losing said identity can be traumatizing
damn memebase
I dun like it
hahaha
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaves
Each room in the dungeon has a different name
hmmm
She did have a LOT of character development
to be fair, I try not to have these sort of ladders, as I enjoy all of the characters (I view them all as an essential combination)
with that being said
Today wasn't that busy
if I had to make a lit
list*
Rarity would probably be the #1
I'm actually here without having to do something else :D
mostly because I think she's had the most development as far as a character goes
plus the situations she faces are entertaining to me
Is....is that a good thing? >_>
I especially like the element of her character relating to boys
Yes it is?
because, I don't see her as some manipulative witch
Yesterday I was here while I was probably supposed to do something else
Okay... just checking
She's generous.
she was simply raised under the assumption that men and women act in certain ways
and has grown accustomed to being treated like a lady
I played one of them a while ago
can't remember which one
/me 10waves at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0E7rWt_t0w

Ponies have influenced my decision making.
10why? :P
it may be elitist of me, but I'll be damned before I subject myself to such nonsense
10D:
>yfw I still want to cry rivers when I think of the latest chapter, 12 hours after reading it
/me 10hides in a corner
Well, some of that nonsense is pretty good...
If you were to ever read a single fic, I'd recommend FO:E.
10hehe, its fine dude, I thought the same not too long ago
Just because of the fact that it is over 440 000 words long and is very well written.
Not that bad, actually.

I understand that, Val.
I have plenty of other sources for my depression needs
10xD
but ponies are my stimulant of happiness :P
I'm a drug called ponies
Want anything stronger than anything you already got for depressive thoughts, read it.
10RainBroDash is RainBroDash's source of happiness
now that I think about it, I'd prefer reading a fanfic (not clopfic) over seeing shipping
/me is feeling his eyes watering again.
heh, there are very few things in this world that can make me shed a tear
Oh, then you'll cry rivers.
10I couldn't live if I didn't have me. Me and I, we're like best buddies to the end
or maybe I was always a cold heartless bastard :P
lol
10rofl
oh wait that came out wrong...
Even cold heartless bastards cry when reading FO:E. It has a few VERY cheap shots.
lol
It wasn't bad.
/me 10has become horribly narcissistic over the last few months, it's great.
I dunno
eh, again I doubt that it'd move me derma

Don't knock it 'til you try it.

Because I though I wouldn't cry either.

That's a very well done picture
Well I mean. Not many fighting games has a character that's two characters.
The coloring, sharing, I like it
argh, beeping!
Oh, BlazBlue talk?
et cetera et cetera
see i'd agree with you that you're right, per say
but
eh i dunno
>mfw interviewing, ship-teasing and spidermanning at the same time
Like a feleica?
Alright re-inviting Val in
but
no
Haven't seen you in awhile.
alrighty, let's see if this'll cheer you up allis
you guys ready?
k
not felicia
Nah
hsien ko
a bit
because that series has a dedicated dash button
eeeeeeeyup
anyway
i think that if you get really in depth
I was going to say a bit more like Jon Tolbain's dash move
14Eeeeeeeeenope
what's that? More Luna?
14Kidding, lets get to it
http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lp7gv2piyU1qincmao1_500.png
there are tons of fighters way deeper than BB
Hey people.
Yeah, there are
but on it's face, BB seems more diverse in it's characters

7ValtheJean: PM
Jon Tolbain is one oif my favriot fighting characters ever.
at least it's my favorite

lol
But yeah, GG and BB
Some of the most diverse fighting games there are
They only reason I don't want another Darkstalkers is becuase Capcom has been making everything in 3D
Poor Spike. :D
Moe luna
mvc2 and 3 have a pretty diverse cast
Deus Ex finally arrived.
I know 3d is easier to make, but 2d fighters don't feel right with 3d characters.
They feel slower.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-houston-were-coming-home.jpg
3D isn't bad. The 3D updates of both Street Fighter and MvC are both excellent.
Meh
Aw fuck, that was the best one, too...
But heh, MvC2 is laughable, seeing how the characters are ridicilously unbalanced
chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-houston-were-coming-home.jpg
dat cliffhanger sathi
with horrible character balance
lol wish I knew which images work and not...
but known for having some of the best fighting mechanics ever
O:
I've just come to it that I enjoy SNK and ArcSys fighters more than Capcom
it seems a bit slow until you get into it.
then again it's been a long time sense I played Street fighter 3.
it's faster than SF2
3 i'd say is comparable.
anyway
i gotta go
i think i left my wallet at this diner i went to
and i have to find my fucking walle.
wallet*
which is worrying because i have no idea where it is
SFIV's speed doesn't bother me that much, but rather the stiffiness, seeing how BB/GG/Arcana Heart/etc give more freedom for the character to move around

No I had lunch yet and already the 3

It's been a few years since I gave GG a go. I'll have to get it off my brother next time I see him.

Hopefully they'll think up something that makes earth ponies unique in S2.
alicorn is the term for a unicorn's horn
yeah, and have it be something significant
At the moment they have some special bond with the ground or nature or something but it's never made clear.

unless they want to make sure they think interracial relationships are ok
lol, looks like you were the only one to think that :P
It's 2011. They're pretty okay.
from canon, we only see pure-breds. from fanon it looks like wings are recessive and horns are dominant :-)
FallSilently: quite; it's kinda, if they want to nail it
Every waking moment, Val :P
It bothers me because I just spent last year studying biology and am interested.

Man, that conditioner really helped Pinkie's hair
because the first rule of editing
there is always something to cut back
50k for a single chapter is excessive
ValtheGreat, ValtheMaster, ValtheVisionary :P
@brushiebrushiemeter Daz
but it's not in conentional rules, it's online.
Pooooooniiies.
yeah, GGgala's right.

It's not really that hard to put conditioner in a pony's hair, Daz
just make sure you rinse it out completely :P
I did likewise. It was terrible.
Lol pre fim is awkward
Ponies before fim are just horrible and ugly

Daz, I got no idea if a hair dryer is useful.
you don't know that it might be a hostile takeover
It's very baws to buy ponies
lol, I'm too concerned about purchasing up in a very...very...odd state
CALL THE DECONTAMINATION TEAM
OH NOES
i am in a state of agreement
I would not feel shame in buying ponies, but that's because I just don't worry about that sort of thing.

/me hugs Apple Bumpkin
Fluttershy.

fluttershy
Does the fluttershy say "Yay" ?
No
Just standard plushies.
Let's play Operation: Bricks edition! Where you're bricked every time you touch the sides
hm
still fluttershy
For extra fun operation use a carbattery instead of the normal battery.
Does the rarity say "Wahaha!"
Lol, no
that reminds me of a sick episode of 1000 ways to die
Fluttershy
Rip open Fluttershy?!!??! YOU MONSTER!
that the battery fishing one?
I don't think I could cut open Fluttershy. Wouldn't have the heart.
ORLY NAO?
ubercharge?
I would kill a man for the Fluttershy plushie
lol
needless to say, he died
Seriously, I would pull a man's heart out for it.
3No ValtheImpaler MOOOBERCHARGE
fluttershy?
I see "Rip open Fluttershy" and I become concerned.
http://askpinkaminadianepie.tumblr.com/post/9382370603
lol
that wins :P
Hahahaha.
then I would keep it
I wish my heart was fluttershy
Would you buy a Rarity, if it weren't a contest between the two?
Best... Organ... EVER!
I know the person that does the AskPinkamina. Very strange person.
Fluttershy is in all of our hearts

Ouch.
4elky I'm suffering from allergy symptoms, meh
oh, what're you allergic to?
powers of 16 is also found uder the powers of 2
fun?
but 1,024 isn't a power of 16
4I'm allergic to cats
the base power is 2
I'm allergic to grass pollen

me too, but only very slightly
/me 4oh noes! I'm dying!
It's gone
BlacklightShining: I think he meant all powers of 16 are also powers of 2
awwwww....no kitties?
I feel sick now
people only think it's important becasue it's clkose to a power of 2
er

7me too
Cracky: 1,024 is important
/me misses his cat
2056 is where it's at.
no it's not!
Like
me too, which is why I put up with the itching eyes and nose
0Kittens are awesome!
11Cats are awesome
11I fixed that for you
we use 1024 because it has the higest common divisibale power/thing
/me 11purrs
because each _byte is 1,024 times the next lower _byte
i.e., 1 TB = 1,024 GB; 1 GB = 1,024 MB; etc.
Horribly crushing. Also, my stomach in squeezing.
9.9
Just awful.
4Whoa
silly Luna, you're not a cat!
0...HNNNNNGH
because that is the minimum addressable size
you can divide 1024 by 2 right down to 1 perfectly
4Sath is using Silver's color
That is purely a cultural connotation
dun dun duunnnnnn
yes

do you react allergically to other pets too?
3>Green penis
its easyter to divide
yes
but we youse it in multiple ten powers of two
wow, Cracky!
at least you can have that
hang on a sec
because powers of 2 are incredibly easy to work with on computers :D
Um
4dogs > cats
11CATS > DOGS
2^10 = 1024
becasue multiple ten powers of two fit nicely within our preconcived notions of the importance of ten
MOPE
4Um
4Dogs>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Cats
4times infinity plus 2
2 = base, power = 10

A combination of being early and being graphic.
Wait, this is a 90s SHOW?!
4Yep
~25 minutes
And messed up - wait that's still graphic.
4I found some great music through this show
>mfw I originally thought it was a 70s show
did you dream about toothbrushes during those 25mins?
:3
lol
4Fun fact: I used to really dislike this show as a kid
due to the mom's haircut
NOT when it's Rainbow Dash's gore!
Honestly it's a gorey story. Nothing else really.
heh
4Most likely because I just didn't get it
4But now?
I swear, I'll turn this pony into a fanon
/me fails to see how that chainges anything
watch me!
4Dear lord, I completely get it. I resonate with it
It's more colourful
you can really "paint the walls" with it
I can handle cartoon/fiction gore. It's when I can picture it vividly in my mind and (eventually due to my stupid imagination) place myself in either position...
/me claps

It's done by magnetic induction loop.
Well its not like its constantly radiating electricity into every direction
wireless charging is old

/me looks at ShadowMane. Then turns to look at SilverMane. Double-takes.

ShadowMane?
i trolled
SHADOWMANE!?!?
I'll kill you if you don't get out of here right now old man.

just because something is old doesn't mean it's practical

he's gone. Good.

No one should interact with shadowmane
well that was a boring boss fight
oh
after all, we still havent cracked cold fusion
I thought you meant practical applications of wireless charging have been out for a while
or controlled fusion for that matter
:P
Inform me
no worries
is this pauper-dari?
dari awake at this hour?
don't worry about it herospirit
Well, I'm in France now.
fusion is beyond our own plannet

it does'nt really mean anything

hi derpy
hello
I hear it's to die for :P
Blums: i tink he means the sun
would you like to see how
lawl
i know but we can do it here too
did he say "get a room"?
>mum describes my suit as a pimp suit
I see
Light apparently being able to provide propulsion.
I'mokaywiththis
(DerpyHooves: I think that's a reply to a message posted before you joined)
I know
Or jsut use electrical confinemt fusion, that's "cold"
Sketchy_Sounds: doesn't seem weird to me, does light have energy and or mass? then it can
I'm gonna go
durrgan?
I win.
See you guys another time
I remember reading about that recently and being all "...the crap."
@pimpmeter Dari's suit
6 Dari's suit is 26% pimp. (1519)
well....for fusion to start naturaly, you need allot of hydrogen...and i mean allot.....for there to be enough energy to start the reaction, and then you need a continuous supply of fuel to keep it going. without the extreme amount of mass its near impossible to keep a fusion reaction stable
if light has mass then it cant go at lightspeed
I recently got into ponies
andherewego.gif
watched it to see all the hubbub
SilverMane: In France, no Durrrrgurrrrrr
:P
Light is a photon, it has mass
>joke “hubbub”
lawl
14WB Dari :P
Dari, no French Durrgurr?
Thanks
photons do not have mass
FOOORE!!!!
I don't have FME installed here
:P
you are thinking of positrons
not photons
ahh crap
14@InFrancemeter Dari
6 Dari is 56% InFrance. (1520)
well JEEZ Dari, did you do ANYTHING right? *trollface*
its been 3 years since i failed physics :/
@Frenchmeter France
6 France is 26% French. (1521)
14The other 44% is back home. :P
k...
except in the case of stars
11so what's next after this ep?
Blums: yes
O____O
o_0
Sister probably wants to talk to her boyfriend on FB.
14Awww
tell her to use her cellphone
11later Dari
herospirit... wow. just wow. No. Shadowmane... is my father
awwww
to create a stable fusion reaction you need allot of energy, in stars that evergy comes from the shere mass of the hydrogen
Cya
was good to see you dari
14See ya Dari
cya Dari
Blums: the idea is not OMG massive ENRGY, the idea is OMG, cheap fuel
and harvesting the energy
but bye dari
That's a cool idea, though, herospirit.
well yeah theres that
@correctmeter Herospirit's Shadowmane story
6 Herospirit's Shadowmane story is 43% correct. (1523)
(yfw I stole it)
(i'm stealing that idea)
I'm cool with that. B]
once you start the reaction the problem is making it go at a steady controlled rate
hey hey
hi
POLYTICIANS.
Hey, nice camera you have there.
yea
>: D
that would be awesome
wait, it's negative percent?
I hope we hear a story from cherilee

EEEEEEYUP

you can synthisize O2 on mars
less shitty acting
not yet
lol
and not on a massive scale
by 10B
And then everyone pissed themselves
we have CO2 burning candles already anwyays
oh she mad
YOU GON DIE
nope....it has ice
dat unreliable narration
Remember kids, only you can prevent forest fires!Q
....
suddenly, circus-ified theme
4Do the doll one
The episodes in it are among the best
Seriously, he just wanted his nose back
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/48667
CO2->O2 is not hard
OH NO
11no more ducktales

not the doll episode
alright then
lol
But pressurized cities? easy as pie!
mwahahahaha
Doll episode is creepy as fuck
it seems as if that people never log off or uit, just put themselves in a status of sleep
mars also has an atmosphere made of CO2
0Can we watch Tales From the Crypt?
and the ice on mars is dry ice anwyays
4YEAH
CO2, not H2O

South Park isn't disturbing, it just pushes buttons of gross factors

I actually really enjoy Regular Show
its a damn good thing if you ask me
NUTSHOT WITH THE SNAKE
4But South Park really became about satire
Okay...
4And yes, that's Neve Campbell
South Park switches from hilarious to utter shit every other season, imo.
That wasn't a good Dimension...
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/season-2-episode-1-return-of-harmony.html
