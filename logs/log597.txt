It is the only time in the movie he wears a number other than "zero." The shirt also has a very small '1/2' written into the logo, making him 4.5, which director Edgar Wright stated on the DVD commentary was

Rainbowdash has wingboner
9 :) out of 10 :)
otakon: the final volume was published a few months before the movie came out, but was still being written when the film started production.

otakon it was published shortly before the movie was released though
Nah, best movie ever was the Super Mario Brothers movie.

and the creator hadn't actually decided how he wanted to end it yet.
I don't like being pandered too, but I like watching otherwise unfilmable films. 9/10

Somehow, for me, you have to understand the references to really get the point of this movie
Basenji, WHAT
So, Single > Girlfriend, what's funny in making sense then?
ScootaChicken: Don't worry, it's 3.6 :P

01,117/10. A lot of points taken off due to them rushing the story so much. If they made it a mini-series or something, it would have been done so much better.

I must getbthe game now
my laptop couldnt let me enjoy it because of its lag
I've only had one GF, and we only went on a few real "Dates". Most of the time it was just us hanging out at my house or with other friends.
Can't imagine why, when I'm such an obviously loveable osul.
FOR EVERYONE WONDERING: NEXT: the last roudup mlp fim<3
I guess i will
8bit awesome
soul*
Yeah, I thought it was pretty good, but would have worked better as a miniseries. 7.5/10
I'm hearing voices, animal noisesThe creme de la creme, the feminine abyssAnd I'm reaching my thresholdStaring at the truth 'till I'm blind
I love this movie so much, it's probably one of my favorite movies actually.
yes, this defenetly sounds more like 4 bit than 8 bit XD
YEAHHHHH PONEEEEE

Special Thanks to Jackie Chan.

lol
HERE WE GO PONEHS!
Zum: read the books and it'll be even more enjoyable

Yeah Sumi, which version is this? Better say now, because if it's the censored you may get a bit of stupid Derpy rage
The original books had a lot of character development scenes that were omitted, here
Zum: yes thats the spirit
SirGanjalf: Eyup
You know, I kinda want to live on a farm now
lol applebloom
Vordox: it works rather well, actually
It seems so fun
IS this the original, when derpy talks?
SP - original is really great
RAWRity: Sounds like a winner.
Applebloom is best CMC!

fluttercry: *shrug*
/me finally calls for food...
Notice her freckles
PWNAGE
Zum: read them. They differ greatly.
ahh yeah it better be old depy in dis episode
IIFierceDeityII: It's still Blasphemy:P
When I was a new brony, everyone was freaking out over Derpy being canon in Feeling Pinkie Keen. It weirded me out.
So, I can be sure this isn't going to be the fully censored one. Is it the original version, or is it the DVD edit?
you think they would show anything else?
And then AJ becomes a murder.
I just had smores!

Wait...
Five.
:P
Scott-Scottaloo Wut? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO XD
And yeah seriously, I think that was probably one of my favorite movies. It's a great nod to geek and gamer culture as a whole, it's got fantastic fight choreography and good humor. My only criticism is that it didn't last longer.

sorry to say, but yes
If you know what I mean
Dark92Enigma, there's always Euro Movie Night
Even though Applejack is the least developed character, I stil find her my favorite. Why should you hate an episode for an undeveloped character if it adds more character development?
dirty jokes time

She claims that she wanted a change of scenery, and "that's all". That is most definitely a lie since that is not the only reason for her behavior.

The things she says in "Party of One" were in no way lies.

SHES KILLS U ALL
it's after breakfast, not when though
0,14nope
I stopped watching every Power Rangers that came out around Wild Force.
Better for verbal abuase than Pinkie Pie waterboarding. her capacity is legendary! :O
ruuuuuuun

oh god shes dead

ITS A GOOD DAY TO DIE

GAH PINKAMENA
It buffered on demon Pinkie for me
0,14heard it was great
NOPONY BREAKS A PINKIE PROMISE!
05,15RPM that's right.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Applejack tries to lie in Party of One, but her lies are very transparent.
NOPONY
JESmith71: it is a sign
I stopped watching at Operation Overdrive
THis is why Pinkie is best pony
RPM is insanely amazing
come back here crimnal scum
why fluttershy?
dinky?
05,15I also heard Samurai is similar to the old episodes
epic race
I've heard good things about Samurai as well
OH SHIT
Murky: Thank you. Bronies call her a liar for some reason.
run applejack,run
0,14yeah, it is
00,10so why was dinky there?
hi dink :)
05,15like...the opening is almost the same
They call this a kids show
dinkie
fluttercry: they brought back Bulk and Skull
Operation Overdrive is terrible
Now pay with your blood
0,14theme is basically the same
The only good thing I've heard about Samurai is the opening.
inb4 raritycatchme
put a cupcake in her eye!!!
WAT
We have you now!
D'aww
CriticKitten: but if this episode was with any other pony it would have like no impact
pony_494: you'll see. plot relevant
0,14Bulk and Skull are back
of flutter
samurai atleast tried to emulate the classic power rangers.
bunneh
damn bunny
derpy was vacationing
I say, applejack never lied in this episode
lol
:S
0,14the Rangers themselves are wonderfully hammy at times
Broken Pinkie Promise > The Royal We + The Royal Canterlot voice
And that's only because it has Mighty Morphin's theme.
YA TRICK YA
Samurai is mostly copypaste of the sentai plots
notice how RD was perfectly ok with murdering the bunny
Applejack lied, but she wasn't a very convincing liar.
Oh right, they didn't have breakfast
the op and bulk are the only good parts
She's richer than us...
she didn't lie
dusty
Pinkie :)
Does this happen with any of the other elements?
She's richer than us!
she said AFTER breakfast
Wonders where they get all the money
LIMIT BREAK!
lmao, 4 bits it is :P
Just how many bits does AJ have? XD
Shes the element of honesty
get THEM
Twilight cant really break her element...
GET TEMEMMMM
Mighty Morphin' Movie.
hen3ry: oh I remember now 6_9
RX-78-LazyBot aren't all PR series basically that
Suddenly... Hooves are pistons! :D :(
two femlae pegasi are outrunnign 4 sexy stallions
Kandarihu: Which is sort of my point. If she lies, it's supposed to be transparent. She's the bloody Element of Honesty. She shouldn't need to create technicalities to avoid being considered a liar. This is my core issue with the ep, even though I enjoy it overall. >_>
EPIC JUMP
IshHypotheticallyInL: No
0,14not really
I like how fluttershy gets to be awesome by extension
twilights cant really be contradicted can it?

RARITYCATCHME
Saying she would tell everything at breakfast means that she would be at breakfast, so I'm nto buying that loophole
raritycatchme!
0,14most of them are localizations, meaning they change up plot details for the US audience
wouldn't it make more sense to just run without having to draw a cart?
05,15I really like AJ's mane.....
Raritycatchme
lmao
trust exercise
MMPR-In Space are extremely different from their sentai counterparts

And here is where hasbro and the Hub teach viewers that racing dangerously to beat oncoming trains is okay. :D
RUN
Whoa, she SPAT A CACTUS
and the first half os SPD
Except for one obvious bit in Dino Thunder where Connor falls out of space and lands in Japan.
of*
OohShiny: No, she lied on multiple occasions in this episode. "That's all" is a clear lie.
How come that doens't get debated?
Why the hell would you not be honest to your own friends?
AJ forgets laws of Equestrian physics.
In my grand fanfic plan, I'm having Applejack become a military general, I just realized that this should pose an inevitable disaster.
Why didn't she just get ON the train?
I like to think Rarity and Pinkie had a wacky adventure together on their way back to Ponyville.
OH NO THE FRIENDSHIP TRAIN WILL KILL US ALL
slavery at its finest
0,14isn't RPM one of the VERY few that's considered better than the original?
the longest train
depending on the team behind it, PR varies greatly in how it follows the Sentai plot
CriticKitten: but she doesnt want to lie
bUT WAIT
Lady you're trouble!
good thing thats the longest train in equestria!
How does that mean she won?
and yeah, Dino Thunder changes a good deal of stuff
pony_300: eeyup
RD and Fluttershy are
it was all, she wasn't going back to ponyville
...Yup
AlchemyGold: they probably did. But Rarity will never speak of it again
Rainbow Dash knew Rarity and Pinkie would be fine, but AJ was on the run and not slowing down. So she decided
11,01Bye blank flanks!
LOGIC
OF COURSE
05,15I was watching MMPR once and during a Zord scene, there was some random asian kid in a green jacket standing next to the MegaZord
I know that's a reference to something
05,15I was very confused
Fou_Lou: She already did. :P
CriticKitten: That's all she WANTED to say
bye Nittany_Discord
RPM is different. It is serious, the sentai it is form is goofy
theres no such thing as better than the original
Soultu: LMAO
wat\
nuts...
mica
Gee i never would have thought pegasi could fly
fly
the why doesn't take part in it is all
DUN DUN DUUUUN
oooh!!! a nano!

Not so fast, Mojo Jojo!
RD USED HEADBUTT
11,01I wasn't leaving.
0,14there can be =P
Vordox: No, she said "that's all", not "that's all I want to say".
INSERT GAME OVER
I laugh at that scene EVERY time! :D
rainbow, y u not do that from start?!

Element of honesty my ass
Power Rangers RPM is the show that brought me back to Power Rangers.
because pride
05,15Ponies *cough* *cough*
CriticKitten: its a typical situation where you cant tell the truth because you fear something but dont want to lie.
butt blue
I wonder if I can get the Power Rangers Movie voted in. I think I have it on VHS somewhere.
11,01Or coach.
Forever dumbed to be second-rate at best. Story of my life.
im blue da ba dee
Sexy
ive never even gotten a first place ribbon :'(
why must it keep loading?
*doomed
Butt Blue isn't a nice color anyway...
Turbo also tried to do teh whole "take a joke series and turn it serious". It didn't work.
05,15That would be awesome
Rainbow Dash is not the element of loyalty at all time too
00,03bLUE IS OVERRATED ANYWAY~
She's being honest now, isnt she?
with the exception of ponies, theres no such thing as better than the original
So its alright.

00,03Whoops, caps >_<
No... no it isnt
0,14^^
Blue?
Just because the "repersent" the elements doesn't mean they are their element all the time...
/me hugs K_A
blue is a boss colour.
butt blue?
Jeez.
what fluttershy said is what made me a brony
:)
This could have all been avoided if she just admitted the truth
Ivan Ooze: the villain defeated by a kick to the balls
Horrible Thought: She didn't win first because unlike previous years, her time kept getting caught by her new friends.
Rainbow Dash, Dash RainBow-Bow!
K_A <3
You're not listenin to a word I'm sayin, are you?
0,14I think either me or my godbrother had one of the zord toys for that
blue is too mainstreame
RAWRity: Turbo was stupid. RPM wrote the characters better.
noooppe
BLUE iS RAINBOW DASH COLOR, THAT MAKES IT BEST COLOR
:D
dame the stream is struggling
Only the mayor, but she doesn't count.
fluttershy has the best lien here
but she was OPPOSING her element
Rainclouuuuuud Nooooooooooo! Don't be a hero! :O
I got multiple blues entering stuff in the county fair... I entered the metalworking category... With Multiple ROBOTS! :)

and then Raincloud died.

In two episode RD is in the hospital
CHIMMICHERRYCHANGA
lmao
Dark92Enigma: Dang Continuity
yay
Freefall29: her poor mane
I still love that the original MMPR cast a black kid as the Black ranger, and an asian woman for the Yellow ranger.
Even though Applejack is the least developed character, I stil find her my favorite. Why should you hate an episode for an undeveloped character if it adds more character development?
Rarity getting RD back will be a highlight of S3.
shouldn't rarity be mad at pinkie for knocking her down? XD
Actually, it would be two episodes
Ikr.
LOL
on to the next one
100/10~~~!!!
2 episodes later, Dash is in the hospital
Racially sensitive that was not.

00,03I... never heard of it
11,01I'm not sure if IMBD has the same problem with Metacritic.
11,01With review bombing
Meanwhile: nope. But it's based around a moment not very big outside of the US's history
05,15That's....not a B movie
>not the original producers with Gene Wilder
Oh god inb4 a thousand rerolls.
05,15But, it is Mel Brooks....
13Nittany_Discord: that people vote all perfect or all terribad, yeah
Gotta see this.
no
Good lord. Where as Gondor when we finally set down concrete rules on what separates a B movie from an A movie?
11,02fluttercry: It's not his version :<
The Producers is a B
00,10the 2005 is melbrooks? you sure?
11,02It's the remake.
05,15oh...
01,11No, the older one is Mel
00,03Good enough?
01,11This one is the remake
0,14I said the one with Nathan lane =P
11,02Here's comes Will Ferrel as the German guy...

my browser crashed, whats the B selection?
00,03Wait... really?
05,1551% on Rotton tomatoes
01,11No, this is an A movie.
0,1451% on RT?
0,14sounds like a B to me
11,02I'd say keep it, I'd love to see The Producers shown.
11,02:P
05,15yup. pretty much
okay if it's 51% that's a B
apparently average ratings count as B movie now? what?
00,03Yeah, go for it!
no
IshHypotheticallyInL: The Producers.
SaxyPretender being all Zecora.
I don't even know anymore.
51's an average to middling film.
08,01THE PRODUCERS! \o/
00,10moveing on then
01,11Bleh. Fine. Balto and The Producers (2005) it is.
Which one EspyLacopa?
00,03Now... for the pony episodes :|
0,14>.>
The 2005 one.
01,11Time for ponehz.
11,02^
08,01i don't watch films more than once in the cinema
13so much kvetching...
0,14that's my word
08,01there are very few exceptions that rule
0,14;___;
08,01the 2005 The Producers was one of them
by that definition, the transformers movies would count as B
11,01So you like Hitler on Ice?
As a note, if higher rating = A movie, then "Rocky Horror Picture Show" would be an A movie. 76% on rotten tomatoes.
The Transformers movies suck though.
enope
0,14falls under the cult classic bit
BAH
Saxy, you must put more shame on Scoot-Scootaloo for confusing Nathan Lane with Nathan Fillion

Hello BaconMane and hello Luna :3
Where was Gondor when a load o' shite I've never heard of came up next week? -and Rina is overrated.
/me claps
Hi BaconMane!
Where was Gondor when AttackAndalite|Zzz said "HAI BaconMane" and AttackAndalite|Zzz beat Meanwhile to a Gondor joke and a ban happening? And I missed the interview cause of school.
BaconMane for Bacon!
hello BaconMane
Hi BaconMane : )
HELLO BACON!!!! :D *claims his free bucket of bacon*
Hi BaconMane!
HI BaconMane!!!! give me bacon!!!
I never saw that interview with Rina, but *clap*
Hai BaconMane :3
"Clap"
00,10Scott, no encoraging spam about your girfriend
OH GOD
I don't like Rina but everyone knows that
No you lose.
/me tackles Luna
07,01Derpy won
GODDAMMIT Meanwhile
No, 2nd!
Curse you Derpy!
yay :3
Woah! -m broke the stream for a moment
I wanted the bacon!
smooze!
01,11So, I saw The Amazing Spider-man recently. Overall, I think it was better than I thought, but still not that great. The rushed and shoved in "connections" that Sony was trying to coppy off of Marvel Studios really screwed the film over.
~yay~ I was first. :)
if it is, ping me when that scene's coming up
BOW BOW BOW
00,03She is NOT my girlfiend :| I just happen to like her :'(
Derpy, will ou share your bacon with me? :'(
I wonder what the smoze would be like if it were g4
I have some writing to do though.
00,03lol :D
Sabershy: Not on my client.
01,11When it slowed down and let its own story run halfway through, it got much better. The acting was much better than I thought it would be, and I especially wished they slowed down the parts with Uncle Ben. I surprisingly loved that interpretation of him.
...
0,5sittin in a tree

Scoot-Scootaloo: who you talking about? :P
holy shit
0,5K I S S I N G

so until then, I'll be WRITEity
that looks kind of awesome actually
stream is derping hard today
it was decent
Silverscreen: you hit it spot on :)
:/
ttyl
Can someone remind me what tonight's B movie is?
BaconMane: Correction...K-I-S-S-I-N-G :3
Scoot-Scootaloo you're gonna have to fight SaxyPretender for rina
How long is this movie actually?
00,03Baconmane, I swear to LordCelestia.
is the stream broken?
Silverscreen, what do you think of The Drak knight rise if you ever saw it?
If we ever show Inception again, I hope they bring back the meowing kitten sound effects as well.
01,11haven't seen it yet.
0,5Dont swear to me
>Otakon > not complain > does not compute
BaconMane: XD
BLOOOD!
B movie is endhiran
0,5BLUHD
I TOLD YOU IT WAS AWESOME OTAKON
01,11The thing that pissed me off about ASM though was the fact that they turned Peter into a complete asshole.
BaconMane: The phrase is 'U WOT M8'.
You gave that name BaconMane
luna found gondor

Man that pic is so old.
BUT NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU, YOU DIDNT BELEIBE MEH

Luna takes her Muffins seriously. Nightmare seriously.
Back in my day we had to walk five miles to see the stream.
Uphill.

Meanwhile: :P
my god
Hey, who pinged me earlier? you scared the HELL out of me!! x_x
01,11Sabershy: Yeah, but it really kills his personality of being able to overcome his issues and stay positive. Instead it makes him look like an emo jackass...hell, he's acting the way Parker SHOULD have acted in SM3

Fun Face.
oops, autocomplete fail
00,10good luck with that I never set up a mail with bronystate =p
Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace.
inb4 Meanwhile's Gondor joke
clock is TICKING!!
that is a fun face
Fun Face loooooool
Where was Gondor when Fun Face?
Silverscreen: That's true. However he wasn't really able to overcome his issues since he didn't catch his uncle's killer though. Plus, i found his attitude more closer to the joke-cracking Webslinger we know from the comics.
FAEC
Additional railings!
who i give my email to?
I smell gas but my oven is electric :S
dat Pinkie
00,10and btw Scoot-Scootaloo, we have an auto system now
nice
Wait... Do those hooves have thumbs?
Eh, tbh if this movie's really that long I might just go to bed.
Sabershy, for me anything that is as close to the comics is great
but I really want the BR release of Holy Grail
omg the hooves have thumbs
DocSane, 2 of them, yes
WRITEity, want.
00,03Ooh yeah! I forget :P
you should watch it meanwhile
it's 3 hours

No. Pony hooves are filled with coffee grounds. :P
so if it's not in the comics I say fack it
Dinky!!!
My antibiotics are kicking me back into a proper sleeping pattern and staying up until 6AM isn't good for them.
Fun Face is the face you make when Butt Fun.
3 min remaining
oh my god
:S
lol
Neither is milk actually.
01,11Sabershy: I guess, but it rubs me the wrong way that they're turning Spidey into more of an anti-hero rather than the straight up hero he's always been known as.
Trollface is real, and he's Japanese: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m83awtkBVk1qe6ixio3_1280.png
buffer!
See, this is why the animators need to avoid bipedalism and having them hold things in the show.
thats my ? :[
00,03Also, we here at bronystate always have a stream 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!
Silverscreen: They are doing a Batman twist?
Either have objects just magically cling to the hooves or have them use their mouths, dammit!
I'm back everypony!
Scoot-Scootaloo: I'm suing you for false advertising.
those lies scoot
Scoot-Scootaloo, don't lie
... is anyone else hearing a digital skip in the audio?
0,14HOLY SHIT
0,14O_O
since when, Scoot?
OH YEHA about that Scoot-Scootaloo !
Scoot-Scootaloo likes to lie
That is what she said
WE MUST GO DERPER
Silverscreen: is that the one with the black space thingy that took voer?
01,11Vordox: That's the vibe I got, especially during the scene between Parker and Captain Stacey
Scoot-Scootaloo: then can I ask for a favor on Dec. 18??? :3
Saxy sounds like he just took it up the rear by surprise
I feel a sudden craving for Minecraft
Ponies do need to be able to hold stuff. Unicorns can't be the only ponies capable of fine manipulation.
Oy! Who is fixing the Youtube Playlist for BrS?
The buffer show is not a stream
Silverscreen:
*overf
Silverscreen: Yeah "Cashin in on tragedy" :P
I HAVE CHIPS
00,03Nah, but we have random streams going on throughout the week, including guest stars!

01,11You know, at the very least, that scene felt very realistic.
How many Love cells?
07,01yes it is
Major I don't know maybe it's an Indian thing
hothothothothothothothothothothothothothothothothothothothtohoththoththtohothtohhtothothothothothot
It's Bollywood. Expect spontaneous song.

nerd pickup lines
MINDFUCK
05,15I don't know what's going on, but I like it. The same thing happened to Bunti Aur Babli
CriticKitten: i can never tell
there are no love cells
Is this real life?
i don't even
THIS MOVIE IS SOO WEIRD!!!
sorry they dont exist
Suddenly the robot has nothing to do with the plot, they have thrown everything out the window...
ACID
XD
Ok,guess i'm going to stare at the walls for most of the film,it could make more sense
Science songs.
Makes my tissues desire..... WAT
That's Bollywood for you. Getting love songs in your Killer Robot movie... :|
0,14it's Bollywood music
Ha, luckily I brought a brace. I've seen enough Bollywood movies to be prepped for the broken neck :P
Music vid?
wut wut wut wut wut
I've actually expected that.
00,10bollywood was heavly influnced from early hollywood

05,15Whatever happened to that Twilight pic Wrek was going to draw after the last Indian movie?
dat high pitched voice
this is interesting....
Honestly I don't mind this. It's pretty good so far.
A musical number? How unexpected
therefore bollywood music is friendship
yeah
is it a better love story than twilight?
At first I hate you. But now I love you.
CriticKitten: This movie is fantastic.
that never happens
rose pettals are bleadin?
I'm just confused from the lack of setup.

i'm kinda disinterested in whatever pliot the movie has. but this isn't too bad really :3
I'm going to read fanfics while this plays. It might make more sense.
Grapes in Honey actually sound tasty.
grapes in honey? Not sure if kinky...

Are you guys trolling us?
DocSane: To be fair, the last Bollywood we watched at least SORT OF set up most of its songs, this was totally outta nowhere

MY GOD MY MIND IF FULL OF FUCK
Sounds like sound logic to me :3
These lyrics are bizzare.

Accross the Universe... What was that one?
Soultu: basically

Not bad so far tbh
TIL that Nittany_Discord knows my real name :3
AlienWarhead: if it werent for the desktop ponies i'd surely have gone mad by now
HOW IS THIS REALATED TO THE ROBOT!?
all I got out of this movie is someone made a robot, negleted GF, gets ready to break up, singing in desert
they taste like grapes in honey'
What is that place?
this i LONG
And it's stopped buffering.
somtimes i dont even know
is this her third outfit?
I picked Enhiran once for B movie, so I'm equally as guilty
05,15Ryunosuke a robot was built, GF got mad, singing. That's ti
05,15and it's awesome
StuffCrusader: It's releated to the love story of the scientist and Sana.
4th outfit.
Well he's no Indian Stallone.
Oi, there's nothing wrong with Indian music.
Take a bunch of grapes, pour honey on them. BOom, Grapes and honey! :D
love cells?
shes speaking SCIENCE
Bollywood drinking game: take a shot when a random musical number starts; two shots if its a music video. You'll be on the floor in half an hour!
Wow, this song is still going?
you hate grapes...and i hate twilight...what do you want...a gold star? -_-
hahah
StuffCrusader: maybe it's in the lyrics? *shrug*
making sure I havent missed anything :p
Science love song?
FOR THE LAST TIME LOVE CELLS DO NOT EXIST
01,11This is surprisingly nice....
and then in the end of the movie it turned out this was all the robots dream before bing complete
Even thought I don't know what they're saying in the songs I listened to
LOl love Cells.
but sex cells exist
...........
4th wall
GOD HOW LONG IS THIS SONG?!

Almost done.
Shawn, tell that to the makers of this movie.
I kinda like this.
Ok I went and came back and this song is still going on????
This movie is actually only 90 minutes long, but has 90 more minutes of random music videos.

The lyrics make me laugh
Love cells do exist... Because! :$

So this is still a robot movie right?
DocSane: I was just about to say the same thing.

Pressure from defense ministry to stop robot from saving people...seems legit
DR. LIGHT!

If you know what I mean.

Mood whiplash!
Aww hell, now if a robot can learn emotion than what is humanity but a complex machine designed to preform tasks

05,15Boom Boom Roboda
Hello again everypony.
DUN DUN DUN.
oooh, she makes good points against him
oh joy, luna eclipsed
again
Thalia's Reveal was kind of out of nowhere, honestly...it made a bit of sense later on, when I thought about it, but it only really makes sense if you new ahead of time about Ra's Al-Ghul having a daughter.
just because you learned an exam, you can do surgery or whatever they're about to do?
Im only going to be here for the B movie then next friday xD
Chee bleeding.
what...
Dat reaction.
:O
Listen to Chitty!
He's brillant
00,10set mode Doctor

00,10it's gonna turn in to the DS game is't it?
he has played trauma center. he knows what to do
this is better than HOuse
Chitti: "House ain't got nothing on me!"
He sees baby.
ooobaaa, ooobaaaa
plastic fetus
05,15Okay, now it's awesome again. Roboda doing surgery
And then there was...that guy from Inception. Being awesome as usual. Full support to be new Robin
ow my balls
01,11You know, as kinda rushed as this is, it's not nearly as rushed as Scott Pilgrim or ASM...and I'm actually enjoying it.
CLOSE YOUR EYES
Aw man guys... This weather is getting bad... Hope I don't lose you!
DAT BABY
what is this?
Don't be scared just calm down.
05,15ASM?
Shooting X-rays into a pregnant woman
0,14Reikim, shhhhh

Ewww
XD
Welp.
Wait
O____e
...Ohmigod
What? her being a villian was obvious early on, and when ras showed up in his way, it was obvious who she was.
I spoilered
0,14never know when someone wants to avoid spoilers
That's weird.
dance pony dance
dat CGI
please
fluttercry amazing spider-man
o.o
HOW did they have a son? I'm back from the bathroom
Silverscreen: imo rushed doesnt mean bad, this movie doesnt really have that uch to offer
hmm. minor privacy violation
05,15oh
Bai all
/me hugs Jmo4267

Ohai
00,10not x-ray is z ray. is 2 better

that's amazing
Hai :3
To show everyone ONE baby
Boo?
Slowter: I think he's using high-res sonography
baby is naked. must die
they are showing... a NAKED MOTHER! SHAME!
This entire movie is unbelievable.
I dunno about Thalia...I didn't see it until after the fact.
Hopefully DocSane
yakuza
We keep calling him a terminator, even though he never kills anyone and delivers babies and saves lives from burning buildings.
Hopefully
Hope this works.
he he penis
eww
he learned nothing.
Again, though, helps if you know Ra's genetic history.
Naked people equeals SHAME!
ewwww pee pee
?
Chitti is the UNTERMINATOR!
it's funny; it's not the several sudden songs, but these recent scenes that make me think this movie is jumping the shark
05,15Is the chord wrapping around it's neck?
SHIT
nah, naked male is fine
well, sh*t
Actually, it's probably just a CGI simulation of the baby from his sensors
haha
so fake its creepy
OH SHIT
44444
Which are magical movie sensors
bollywood, y u put so much effort into vfx?
O_O
05,15Is he PRYING HER OPEN?

This is the only way
He's prying her open!
O_O
11,01Wow.
Did he just crack open her pelvis?
fluttercry I think so . . .
It was obvious when her and bruce had their moment at his mansion, if not before from her wanting to acquire the reactor
robotic birth control
Only way!
i liked the actor who played bane Reikim
ded.
GAAHH MUST NOT WATCH
that... looks like it hurts... Id on't want children.
SaxyPretender, only to the Japanese
out he comes
:oh my

Moments like this make me happy to be a man =D
It's the same as using a pelvic spreader
Gosh, it better not be a windows countdown
HOW DID THEY...........HAVE A CHILD.......I'm sorry, i'm just back from bathroom break

and that's how celestia was born
Now upload to youtube
Now he kills the baby
Huzzah!
gotta love how everyone is like "this is a huge milestone!" when both a mother and a childs life is in danger
I no want a robot for my nursemade.
00,03...What did I just see...
ROFL Lil
I was really hoping she wouldnt be a villain, and that Bane was the only villain. But nope, she was the real mastermind
Kandarihu: Oh, that explains it
truck crashes through the wall
i read that Reikim and i'll kill you later
And the best possible use they have for this robot is as a soldier. Nice.
Thought Chitti was going to split her in half for a second.
now he sticks the baby in the blender...
he just happens to be there
Still has a point.
The only thing that would make this more awesome is if the baby turns out to be... a bomb!
Scoot-Scootaloo: A baby get delivered by a robot
That baby's been UNterminated!
it took away from bane's awesomeness
uh oh
Oh god
Scoot-Scootaloo I'm still trying to figure that out myself
oh boy
/me licks TheGreatAndPowerfulT s rage
:O
To the credit of the movie, I actually thought that Bane might be Ra's son for a moment, before my inner knowledge kicked in.
build a thousand robots like him and get lightninga to strike them in the faecf
Smile
Uh oh.

DAMN!
01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: as for as anything new or innovative, you're right, nothing to take from this movie. But I have to say, it's wonderfully entertaining and asks a lot of challenging questions. It's also well paced and well acted, and gives a lot to think about if you look past the simple story.

05,15This Robot has got SWAG written all over him
We interrupt our story for DANCE
It's time for just hammering out the basic structure, then going back and editing later on.
I hope they wave their hair back and forth

Well, my other problem is inspiration.

I got the idea from Terry Pratchett, actually. Supposedly he wrote The Colour Of Magic in two hundred word chunks a day.
what did he do spy on him?
uh oh
:c
I'm beginning to think this evil japanese guy is God, because he seems to know EVERYTHING at the moment it happens
I wish, but, I'm a student. I can't even afford a bad-dragon fleshlight or dildo.
01,11Dude's playing a hell of a chess game here...
I still haven't gotten to reading Pratchett's stuff yet.
I don't like where this is going.

Good to know more than one writer sticks to that creed and what the hell

this is a pretty clever film. it hides well behind it's silly exterior.

~It's not over, not yet!
MASF123: i meant the movie makes no sense in its development, not the robot feels

Ahahah.
Big lipped aligator movie
DocSane: Everything I know about this movie came from AVGN, I'm quite hyped XD
155 or 174 depending on which cut
05,15Nobody C C C C Combo broke that?
Try Big Lipped Alligator Movie.
i think the mean nipples not dimples
how much of it is actually left?it's getting kind of late but i can't go to sleep wiithout seeing the end at this point XD
05,15So like.....wut
01,11The strange thing about this movie...is that everyone (sans the villain) is justifiable for being jackasses. The robot's justifyable seeing that he know understands the concept of worth and expresses it. the professor's justifyable since the robot quite litterally destroyed his passion and dreams. The girl's is also justifyable because she's caught in the middle of it all, and the
1,11professor's co-workers were justified in that they just wanted credit for their hard work.
eeyup
I'm guessing they throw in something that hasn't got anything to do with the movie so they can use it for publicity without spoiling the story?
this movie... is long
Fenr: it's over halfway done.
Fenr: uhh, an hour?
Literally this entire movie can be described as "suddenly, something else happened"
TheXIIILightning: I saw it in February at the Boston Sci Fi Marathon.
Bunti Aur Babli was longer
CRAP!!! Dat sudden rain and open car windows and... Oh hay.. Song's still going! :D :$
Alpaca for Season 3!
European movie night is going to come before this ends
He looked so unsure just now
Yeah it's 155 minutes
shit,5:35am now,guess i wont sleep then XD
one day, we have to watch "Sholay"
Paen.
TheXIIILightning: I think I went into the lobby during this song.
JESmith71 the song?!?
05,15billions of tissues?
Just like Luna's last choice, although this one started good
suddenly another side of the earth
So many people have been in the wrong in this movie
How long is that?
No the movie
What's playing next????????
She's a soaked fruit... giggity
05,15Sounds like Friday Night to me
....
mmm i like biting chicks
it has a scene where a man with no arms kicks his enemies to death.
she's... wet
hmm fold...nah i dont get it
So.... does the robot come back?
How far are we in the movie
00,101 hour left
lol
Sexual Innudeno.
fluttercry: lol
Wat am I watching? It was a movie a few minutes ago.
oh
Soaked fruit? What?
Silverscreen: i wouldnt call killing someone justifiable, just because he didnt do what you want
Huh.
"Bite me slowly". NEED AN ADULT.
:[
We need to see MATRIOSKA!
Sumi: whoa, i was just kidding
Silverscreen does that Justify that she was playing whore?
meh. Watchmen is over 200 minutes
anyone elses stream just buffer there?
Rookeealding: Keep watching. The movie's title is "Robot" after all.
I look at the songs as a type of intermission
watch like the rest of the movie be this
really AVGN?
5000 hours of a single image
I think I've heard this hook before
....oh dear

Parental Guidence is suggested.
Aha aha

05,15Pretty sure this is all a giant metaphor for them having sex
fluttercry: you think?
fluttercry seems legit
POMPADOAR
00,10you are probably right fluttercry
dat ass
Now they are just repeating lyrics.
I thought she didn't like when he counted their kisses
I'm eating what's either the best or the worst kitchen sink stew I've made ever.
fluttercry: *nic cage face*
We should watch Andy Worhol's "Empire"
Sometimes I think we have pony episodes after the movies to keep our sanity
DATS NOT GOOD
Singing about Kilimanjaro in the ANdes. Sure..
00,10I recall one like this in the one luna picked
Mmm, butts
01,11twilight_Sprinkle: He created Chitti to help the world. Chitti failed that mission in openly defying his creator. From that standpoint, he was completely justified.
i told him that madness
I guess Singing is sex for people in India
derp
they are having sex
Sumi what did she pick?
She's a bitch that's why.
AttacktheAndalite: My thoughts exactly.
It's an 8 hour static shot of the Empire State Building
and they use the song to distract us
=/
fluttercry: So this movie is implying that their sex is....like a giant dance sequence in Peru?
11,01Next person to advertise a referral link gets banned.
Silverscreen: doesnt mean youre supposed to kill it!
00,10Bunti and Bundy or somthing like that
Intermissio indeed! :) I had time to get dressed, grab my keys, go out into the rain, and shut my car's windows... and the song is STIIIIIIL going! :D
I'm a skin instrument?!
CriticKitten: isn't it always
Meanwhile: Which part, the butts or the nic cage?
Pleasure.

07,01correct Summie :)
AttacktheAndalite: Butt.

Nittany_Discord: is bringin down the hammer
I'm not gonna look that up
100 grams waist...
00,02Wrek, you here?
01,11twilight_sprinkle: Did he kill it or simple dismantle a machine like it was a regular computer?
Actually, we need HORROR
This is the filthiest song I've heard in a long time
Really? an hour left?
then there's Andy Warhol's "Vinyl", which is a retelling fo "A Clockwork Orange" done in a single take.
Hed killed it.
She's a Scootaloo!
Meanwhile: *wraps an arm around your shoulder* Innuendoes, innuendoes everywhere
yeha eat dat grass
0,14dude, they are kinky
Scootlaoo.
Tigers eat grass? I'm not from India but I'm pretty sure they dont... :(
what, seriously? one hour left?
I don't think this movie can tell the difference between a robot (machine) and an AI (computer)
Silverscreen: he dismantled it. I think it might be restored
Silverscreen, he dismantled Chitti with a fireaxe and a beaker of acid.
mica
Scootaloos?
ahahaha.
Silverscreen he destroyed it with an axe
Human Centipede or A Serbian Film. Which would you prefer?
Not that kind of grass lol
AttacktheAndalite: *Pokerface*
An hour really? Since it's 155 min I thought it'd just be 30 left
TheXIIILightning: What do you mean everything on this movie came from AVGN?
0,14haHA
what the fuck?
I seem to be less suceptable to anger when I sleep more than 4 hours
I liked Luna's Bollywood pick, too. This movie's been amazing but I don't think it's had a single song as memorable as the one from the middle of Bunti aur Babli.
Silverscreen: he killed it, and killed it like a person, he killed it with rage. if it were pure dismantling, he should scrapped it for parts, or fix it, keep working on it
Serbian Film would never make it in.
There was an intermission.
oh my
Indeed.
How long has this gone on?
Phffffffffttttttttttttttt
No way in hell.
and now I'm tempted to to find this song and download it.
00,10ah hell
CAUSE THIS IS FILLER!
I think we needed a 10 minute break at the intermission part of the movie
suddenly back in india
OH Hi movie
FILLER TIME
that hook was catchy
Human Centapede it is!
