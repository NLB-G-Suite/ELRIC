god i love 1995 scripting for games
lol
Don't turn to jelly! Stand your ground and fight them.
13asdfghjadgh
06o-o
13Got halfway through Remilia's last spellcard .w.
13Closest I've ever gotten to beating it |D
6LOL
6her last spellcard is a nightmare
!espeon
:3
13To be fair, a couple of her spellcards caught me off guard and killed me since I didn't know what to expect |D
6but then fighting her in 6th stage is 70% luck
6those bullets come WAY faster then necessary
hey guys
13True LOL
allo
13I got lucky and didn't lose any lives or bombs against her this time
hi dermathi
13went onto Remilia with 3 lives and 1 bomb
still lookin' for wais to make l4d2 fastar
13still wasn't enough |D
Dman, don't bother. Mine just crashed during the ENDING CINEMATIC
6yeah you usually need at minimum like 3 lives, full bombs
MOTHERFING GAME
D:
6until you get used to fighting her
13Then again, at least two of her spells caught me off guard
13where something suddenly shoots at you or something
13wasn't expecting it |D
6yep
6NOTHING like her in CtC
btw silvermane and silverscreen, I got a Synchtube.
I have a perfect setting that works for me now dermathil, but i can only use it with sv_cheats set to 1
I had actually forgotten I had it for the last month
(not in most servers : / )
6everyone loves cookie cutter shark
/me 6runs
i don't really know wha that means Derm
synctube
i don't remember what that is
a website where one person (dermathil here) hosts youtube vids
You can watch youtube vids all at the same time, synched up
and everyone has a chat, like livestream
as dermathil says, it's synched.
ah ok
I see nothing!
except it is their videos not me that records live.
So one can do a Gurren Lagann Marathon!
/me 11returns from Ponychan briefly
(Filly and Mojo are two Synchtube channels that are populars)
alright
11Synchtube?
11Wat dat?
read above, silverscreen
11oh, I see now.
>yfw Bethesda thinks they have trademarked the word Scroll
wat
And are calling Mojang out for their game called Scrolls (that is barely in development)
11Oh yeah, I know of this place.
They say everybody will confuse it with SKYRIM
those guys are idiots.
how?

I'm back!
hey pegacorn!

You can salsa out of peanuts
fyi
Why do you love me RainBroDash?
11http://www.synchtube.com/r/Silverscreen
well well well, if it isn't RBD
What's funny is that RainBroDash is the only one who doesn't show up in colors for me, because my mIRC is set for teal on black.
Heh
Silly topic, that's not how you spell Gilda
GILDA OUTTA F'ING NOWHERE.
lol
Silly RobotPinkie Gilda isn't a pony.
what if gilda was pony?
Yeah she is, coolest pony in Ponyville
lolwut
You're just too lame and square to see it.
But she IS cool.
also hai guise
But Gilda isn't in Ponyville.
Or is she?
shes hiding
planning murder on pinkie pie
She is when you guys stop being lame, srsly
She's stalking Rainbow Dash isn't she.
I wonder where RainBroDash went.
Also planning to go full cupcakes on Dash
Gilda wouldn't go cupcakes on Dash.
Gilda <3 Dash
Gilda x Dash is a popular ship?
I hope shes comes back in season 2
GildaxDash:A ship that i'm ok with.That and HunterxWitch,but that's another story.
lolwut
I'm not opposed to Gilda/Dash, but I think that works better with it being one-way
'You arrogant little ruffians just think you're the best when it comes to killin' monsters, don't you? When i was a lad, we used to eat monsters FOR BREAKFAST!! With a side of hash browns! And some juice. You super-deformed pipsqueaks should leave the monster-stompin' to the big boys and GO HOME!'
HunterxWitch:A non-existent ship between two special Infected from L4D.
Fred Phelps x Neil Patrick Harris
make it happen.
Neil Patrick Harris x Suit
Dash x cloud
Colgate x toothbrush
Read that one. :/
Angel bunny x carrot
Pinkie x battleship
The dash one.
I wanna read dash x cloud
I HAVE ANOTHER NON-EXISTENT SHIP!
Bruno MarsXGrenade
'I predict you'll all die a horribly gruesome death and have to restart'
god dammit Japan
trololololo
Tomatoes x Fags
Isn't that like Dash x Dash?
Tomatoception
I always imagine random crap that doesn't exist.
I guess so
Dash x Dash x Dash, and then they have 1000s of children who grow to maturity very fast
i've read it
Same
FOR THE NEW RAINBOW REPUBLIC!
Celestia x Parasprite
ONE DASH, ONE VOTE
Where every Rainbow Dash will have a vote.
Celestia x Spike
RAINBOWS!RAINBOWS EVERYWHERE!
rainbowdashxrainbowdashxrainbowdash
Pinkie x Pie
Celestia x Spike is real, actually
Equestrian Pie
Everytime someone says X! X EVERYWHERE! I hear it in the voice of the stupid enemies in Mass Effect.
RAINBOWCEPTION
lol
I've seen Dash/Dash/Dash
It was one of the best examples of [Random] [Shipping]
thats what im ona bout freezeframe :P
it's called uyh...triple rainbow?
Dash travels back in time to have sex with herself, making herself pregnant with herself, thus becoming her own mother and father.
11http://www.synchtube.com/r/Silverscreen
Make it happen.
lol
RobotPinkie,i am dissapoint

I don't know, you just always are disappoint with something
12Stll making edits to the profile visitors
TELL ME!
cool
not like you're always disappointING, no, that's not what I meant
You can't make a drill pop out of your arm, Pegacorn.
That'd be why, I think.
True, I guess that's disappointing
That's why we all always disappoint.
WRITE DOWN ALL THE REASONS WHY I'M DISSAPOINT NOW!
I ALREADY DID
ORLY?
lol
06this new gaming mouse is AWESOME
not enough shipping in chat.
That's for you to know and for Bjornfort to find out
06the drivers for it can make pre-sets on it, just like with my Steelseries ZBoard :D

No.It's because i have a healing factor.
11hmm...

/me 11uses said machete to slash off Pegacorn's arm.
Please Silverscreen,end my torment and my misery!
inb4 kick
Oooh, pretty
/me 's arm regenerates
Shoot him in the head... It's the only way to make sure.
Actually, you jam something in the medulla oblongota
Actually nuke from orbit is only way to be sure.
?
That's how they did it to the cheerleader and to Sylar
Nope.
Sounds hot.
11bjornfot
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
11ha
/me shoots himself in the head and survives
So it CAN be hurt
Pegacorn x Tomahawk/
?
Good ship!
Make sno sense
*Makes no
brb
Would you prefer Pegacorn x Bjornfort?
Ah, missed by just an inch
/me 11puts Pegacorn in Cupcakes. Sees if that works.
11Sweetie Belle Soonface: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/131274279099.jpg

I'm back
Saving that for strategic later use.
Tadaima
06need to test this bad boy of a mouse out on a game, BBL
I wish 1) I was better at making AMV/PMVs and 2) we had a few more normal Luna scenes to work with
Because my iTunes just went to Papercut, and it seems like it'd be great for Luna/NMM
11Don't worry. Season 2 brings more Luna.
freezeframe - you wanna make a luna papercut song?
Strategic use?I don't think so!
okaeri, Dman-kun
/me shoots RobotPinkie
Dman: The lyrics just seem to fit
yada yada
sure do :P
/me is made of bullet proof alloys
Occasional flashes of the Mane 6's breakdowns, too, but yeah.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
freezeframe you just missed a very good video
I use like a rather normal mouse, the only problem I have is that I don't have enough space for it lol
with excellent editing
: /
6that was in purple, what you saw was an illusion
06i was shopping for new gear today, since i needed a present for my dad his birthday
06so i just bought him a new headset :P
On Silverscreen's synchtube?
/me is playing games right now, can't really youtube
k
it was 'assassin's creed beautiful lies.' it was so good, it was used by Ubisoft :P
DAMN YOU ROBOTPINKIE!
and I love it
y u damn me?
:3!
7hah I have a channel aswell now :P
Oooh, that is a good one.
oooo perty
7currently streaming tenacious D
I'm the only person alive without a synchtube page. Fact.
would watch but with silverscreen : /
7np :P
I have had one for yeeeers
7it's only odd they don't sent out an registration e-mail...
hmm, now who should i ship to who... or what
hmm
RobotPinkie: I don't have one either.
RobotPinkie x cupcake. fund it.
Who's cupcake?
Sklar's on skype. :P
it's a what
cupcake is probably your latest victim >_<
I don't have victims!
What kind of person do you think I am? :O
Hmmm... Now, actually, I need to figure out which version of papercut would be better for that PMV
I do make cupcakes though. Really really good ones.
Papercut or Ppr:Kut
i make good brownies and yelow cake
afk
I love brownies
I would love to ship with brownies
Nah, as much as I like the background music of Ppr:Kut, Papercut is much better overall.
/me has Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, and Meteora, naturally.
13Ok so I'll admit
freezeframe - semirelated but there's a newgrounds animation that's really good.
13I honestly think this Pokemon is so ugly it's cute
13http://i51.tinypic.com/2qdxwur.png

06actually, it is

13I do still hate its evolution though xD
6I still don't care for trubbish or its evolution though
/me also has minutes to midnight, but hasn't yet bought ... that other one. it's kinda meh

hello anyone home?
Nope
dubtrotmaster, we're all http://www.synchtube.com/r/Silverscreen
All here in silverscreen's youtube synch
aka synchtube
okay im going there
Synchtube does not work well in Internet Explorer! Please use Google Chrome or Firefox
i dont use either of those
You're not using chrome or firefox? :o
whoa dude
whoa. sitll, it may work fine with IE
^_^
I can't get it to work with IE.
With IE9
Dashite you're here thou
there *
In Firefox. Just loaded up IE9 to test.
ah ok
Wet~
03LOL
Well
Not anymore :D
I did a big no no today with a circuit in order to measure how much current was being drawn
shorting across a switch with an ammeter
03I'd step away for like 10 seconds and it was static
FAIL
03Yeah
03Sony sucks
that is why you DON'T use the radio for providing music for an event
03their boomboxes are terrible garbage now
03I'm not
03I just needed something to put on while my sister was making a playlist for her mp3 player XD
06i don't like sony too
06for sound systems, i prefer Bose :P
03right now I just have it playing music from her (EW) iPod through my Logitech computer speakers
03I'm just using the Sony boombox to amplify it nice and loud
I would still hunt down a CFS-6000 boombox though
06i woulkd like the BFG-9000 boombox :D
nope
06ahw....
the CFS-6000 was a boombox made by Sony in the mid 1980s
03Sony was good in the 80s
03*90s
03we had a really awesome Trinitron flat-screen CRT TV
it has autoreverse cassette along with an AM stereo/FM stereo tuner
the AM side is multisystem
06the BFG-9000 was a boombox made by ID in the FIRST stage of FPS game action
Harris/Kahn/Motorola/Magnavox
that or one by Sanyo would be a killer find
the MW-250
same as the Sony one
in terms of capabilities
06BFG-900 as in BOOMBOX is a Big F*cking Gun
06:d
/me flees
06*BFG-9000
03inb4 The BFG (Book)
some of the 1980s boomboxes also get shortwave broadcasts
but I am not too interested in those
I already have one of the best modern communications receivers for shortwave
03ut of course you do
03*but

12See, I think most of us were looking at the " too
12XD
12http://www.pokemon.com/us/trading-cards/database/ex-series/ex10/112/
12That card I do have :3
12yeah make me jealous
12XD
12It was from Unseen Forces
/me tries to take your leash off
12i know
12D:
/me fastens leash
/me frowns
good enough
12I don't have any other Eevee EX cards though ;-;
My PS2 runs Black Rhino.
let's not get into what it's based off.
12i have flareon and vaporeon
12and joleon and vaporeon star
12D:
/me barks at Nick
12I’ve actually been consider just buying them all on eBay :D
12lol
12considering*
12All of the Eevees that is XD
The actual ambernova server runs off a debian server :p
EYAAAAhahahaaa
12I remember getting Flareon and Vaporeon ex in 2 packets I bought in woolworths many many years ago
/me yelps at the muzzle
12Problem is, it probably would end up costing about $150+ to hunt them all down XD
12o-o
12lol
12Unless I just started looking for the packs instead |D
12Might end up spending less if I did that lol
/me scratches at muzzle
12+ more cards
12Yep :3
12i got flareon and vaporeon ex at nationals for like 6 each
12Ah
RainBroDash.Wazzup.
/me FLEEEEEEEEEEEES
12espeon star was up at a vendor for 100
12and umbreon star was up for 80
12lol
/me chews on Nick for revenge
12I think I've only bought one card online and it was a certain Mew card I wanted and after loads of packets of failure (i got nearly all the rares apart from the one I wanted LOL) I bought it online :3
12That's pretty awesome
12Every other card I have is either from packets or trades :3
12My friends used to be little thieves though when we were kids >_>
Anypony still here?
12Yeah, all my cards are from packs :3
12So when I found out they stole my card I took it right back, as well as another one of theirs as a sign to "never steal from me again" xD
/me has shaper teeth
12XD
12I remember the day before I was finally able to trade the old Charizard card with someone (everyone wanted that around our area and this kid had 2 and would trade me for a Kabutops) the Kabutops card suddenly went missing >o
i are
no one else rly
lol
12And my friend got a Kabutops in "a packet he bought".
12I remember my brother used to sneak and trade with my cards XD
12Heck, I was not stupid as a kid so, the bottom line is I got my charizard in the end ;3
12LOL!
Ohai Dman
Only Pokemon card I have left is a holographic Typhlosion that my best friend gave me before he moved
hello again
hello
We gave eachother our bests cards to remember eachother
lol fail
12That's really sweet <3
talking about me
not you
Ohai everypony
12What did you give your friend?
I believe I gave him a Lugia
12hmm
rainbrodash outta nowhere
That being said, our best might not be someone else's best. We didn't play properly
And we had emotional attachments to one card over another just because of the pokemon, not how effective the card was
12<3 That sounds like me as well
12I used to REALLY want a Charizard card, so I traded my brother a Shining Gyarados card XD
12I never got a shining card D:
12Funny thing is, the Shining Gyarados was in reality a better card XD
12But back then I only carded about the Pokemon the card was lol
12cared*
12I remember that everyone wanted my Moltres from the fossil collection owo
10:3
12Every around my area seemed to have Articuno and Zapdos from that collection, but never Moltres XD
12Yeah, Moltres was really rare lol
12I only have one Moltres to this day
12I was too attached to let it go ^^
12A lot of the cards I have, have some history to it
12Surprisingly though, Articuno was not very rare compared to other legendary’s
Almost every collection has an Articuno
12e.g Dark Magneton was the only card that wasn't lost when I took my cards out to the city and I lost nearly every single shiny card bar Dark Magneton, so I had to collect all over ;w;
...keksy
12and I still have it <3
With its popularity, you'd think it would be the other wat around
Tommy_Wiseua
12Dark Magneton :3
once again I failed at /Nick command <<
even though my own name is nick
/me is executed via impalement on spikes for noobyness
12Dunno if it was just me, but Magneton cards seemed really rare for a normal Pokemon
suddenly me
can anyone see me?
please?
lolwut
is anyone able to see this?
oh for the love of Celestia, will someone reply?
i need to know if this crap is broken or not, school computers aren't acting right

>know what it's like to have a sexy voice
but that doesnt really fit with that scene so..
boner = shock ?
>such a burden
hahaha
whats the best Rarity remix?
colgate... lawl wut
7Hey, NS.
199 - soon 200 aginz

It's survival

Well I'm not moving it back any further
12I was just kidding NS lol
K newdcd
i'm stuck in awesome-face right now
Pegasi
lol
its a YTP
7Okay.
its prolly the funniest one
exactly, so not all wingboners are caused by arousal
It would be nice to know if it was a man or a woman first.
all of them in an orgy
7Is the meeting 5 or 6 o'clock EDT?
ALL THE PONIES
9what is everyone talking about, anyways?
uh
Celestia Radio
i would go for pony
newdcd celestia radio

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMrQcn-LiO0
full of sex jokes, though, in case you care
http://ponify.me/
6 8/8 at 10pm
So naturally our wings flare when frightened/shocked/angry.
the second more than the first XD
keep trying till ya get in
especially dash cuz ponies are sexy
9not really interested
That's GMT
LOL
I should have a post, move that back by half an hour
sigh
03omfg
>not really interested >doesn't know what he's missing
9I think I'll wait for it to be done to start streaming
@ Roara
9well
OH GOD RERAPENING
Also I need to move the TF2 server
6how about
But similar reactions result from arousal in several other manners as well.
/me has been lazy
NOT THE RERAPENING
7Okay, before.
9it's listening to Celestia Radio
6how many hours from now
LOOL
9or it's playing Z2
Uh
7So that's 5:00 EDT.
/me yes
9and I just got Big O
newdcd - listen ot it with us :3
Erm...
hahahah
6which is 2 my time
Around 21 hours
6wont be here
appledashwins second one is funnier tho
Oh god.

03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et_MmlTxMXA
Laughing so hard. :D
9sorry, Roger Smith kind of trumps shit
>mfw I notice NewDCD is about to stream and I got a headache.
Can't do it any other time
Well
6thats fine
hihi
6I don't really want to take part lol
7Ah, time zones.
I could move it back by another 2 hours
>mfw i'm going in a few minutes :(
7Remember how I had to coordinate the TF2 game? XD
convince me to staaaayyyyy
how do we get our shit read?
With a name like that... its a good thing applejack isnt here
Hopefully speaking in purely scientific terms is still PG. Assuming I avoid anatomy lessons xP
Yeah XD
9CAST IN THE NAME OF CELESTIA
silvermane - about t ask
DAT HAT
6lol
9YE NOT THE GUILTY?
appledash <3
probably a stream sumwher
9BIG pOny, SHOWTIME?
Because I mean really
you're talking about wings so I'm assuming thats pg
YES
SOON THE MUSHROOM
Can you make it at 12 or something, Roara?
DOO EET
BTW NewDCD, I got Tekkaman Blade last time I played SRW-J
Gall bladders and femurs are hardly PG.
SOON
Because that'd be 2 hours back
xL
03funny as hell
how is a gall bladder not pg?
"I AM YOUR TOY"
^
doesnt that just release emzymes to help digest stuff?
\w/ -_- \w/
Arti can probably make that and most people should as well
7Rescheduling the meeting a day before it occurs isn't the best option, though.
9eh, it's full
Femurs aren't PG? I'd say lack of femurs isn't PG...
oh my.....
"MUSHROOM!!!!!!!
9maybe I should just listen to the recording
7 3:00 EDT works for me.
MUSHROOM BEGINS
yeah basically, you can live without your gall bladder
Imagine how grimdark MLP would eb without femurs...
R RATAN PONY DISCUSSAN
Better than saying *ommited* xP
6like i said
newdcd keep trying
04http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/4464/impossiblek.png
And I dunno, it's probably better to leave it as it is though
i had to try like 20 times
6I don't really want to take part
04impossible
It's fine
04but done
i found out how to message him
6so I'm not going to make too much of an effort
SINGING WWU!
omfg
THAT VOICE
Alright
YES
/me PG is so overrated.....
aww interrupted : /
6so yeh
Well, we'll hold another meeting on a weekend or something
7Isometric paradox, Chim!
Ah
9as I said, I'm more interested in SRW
well newdcd i told silvermane
and freezeframe
and gggala
WWU + DAT VOICE
THE TIME HAS COME
04yep
04~
btw NewDCD, I got a Synchtube now.
for some reason i don't feel like recording him. dunno why
DAT VOICE
lol
uber high
wait, told me what?
7Random comment:
gggala in silvermanes stream
9Synchtube ain't bad
Started a watching of TTGL on there
9but for me, it isn't really streaming
but it ain't livestream
7I feel bad for shortening your name to the same pronunciation as 'chyme'.
ha?
well
7Did I say that before?
if pg is overrated then go to equstria after dark
I know.
9either got to be live
/me hugs Altair
im kinda glad this chat is PG
9or it isn't a stream
yea newdcd - we saw some GL ther :P
Yeah
/me hugs back :3
Me too!
me three!
Altair you need to fix the forum spoilers tag
or else, who knows what you guys would be talking about...
and read the To do list topic
That's why I say I got a livesync, not a livestream.
black woman?
Heh heh.
We'd be talking about cupcakes
9Rasquisha?
thats not funny
newdcd is in?
I wouldn't know...
YAY
she comes from the herd
04Quan are you okay owo
me one
lol
eeyup
/me would be having relationships
Not-pg does not equal sexual stuff, its excessive blood, gore, and cruelty aswell
7Yep.
And a happy root beer :3
so, anybody from the UK?
who is this legend of a man?
Also hi
9this is pretty lackluster so far
WHAT FIC
Why does it always have to be sexual...
.....................
Trust me, it's already like that in other chats without the PG tag xP
because rule 34
Hi Pyroh!
newdcd - was amazing before
9well this might be interesting
yeah
oh god
Hey buddy!
WHAT
what the hell
WHAT IS EET
is hell a PG word?
How goes it :3
MONOPOLY?!
Celestia Radio plays monopoly?
relationships are pg rainbow dash, but not whats done behind closed doors
The game the game the game
I wonder if Vector Calculus is PG...
Nukin Equestria are ya?
probably not...
I hear that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a love letter to the various Robot genres and is creating a whole new generation of Robot Animes.
it was really well hidden, the game was
Because, they usually just turn to, to put it bluntly, pornography
So much game. >_<
Nope not right now...
Dman ohh, i was playing spiral knights fora while there
Cool cool
dermathil - newdcd said that a few days ago :P
GGgala o ok
I'm having an engaging conversation
9The gay was over
derpybot help
O. ... O.K.
R.U.B.C.?
With the active peoples....
/me does specify specific cuddly-kissy scenes though
7What don't you get?
oh yeah I remember now, Dman.
well thats true i guess
Nothing graphic, but...
7Don't take that as some sort of imperative interrogation.
...
rainbow dash would never be cuddly-kissy
i just dont see it in her
...
Ok then :3
why do you have to do this??
/me licks Blums
12hi slashy
...
Rainbow
I wonder if one of the reasons why people were so psyched about Gurren Lagann was because of the Pacing of the episodes.
what does that ^ mean???
Why do you lick everyone!
9dat imitation
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO RAINBOW DASH
dat imitation
He's damn good at that.
/me is like damnit
cuz he never talks!
7O_o
epic
GIVE US RAINBOW BACK
'Cause it really isn't drawn out by filler episodes at all.
silvermane ... >cuz he never talks! :( ruin

Lol.
9nice reading voice, too
i refreshed the page i was 'Dma' and was reentered as Dman
Everybody's stereotype against rainbows....
wat
Technically rainbow dash has an inverted rainbow
Well
If he didn't have such an awesome voice...
...i guess you could say ...*glasses*...everythingwentbetterthanexpected
so it doesnt look like a pride flag when she stands against a rainbow background in "best night ever"
lol
what fic is this?

If rarity ever joined though, She would be so ignored D=
THIS IS COBALT
I'll pass
oh hey newdcd i did that upload speed check and i have like .8 ^_^
wait wut how?
Applejack is the best one, anyways
This is ...*glasses*
?
dont say which pony is best pony infront of the mane 6
Applejack.....
I don't understand how people can have a favorite of the mane six
9so how long is this thing?
yesssssss
they're all so epic
I can't pick one
um...good~~
Hey everypony!
NewDCD i don't actually know

"this is pussy shit when are they gonna fuck i'm skipping this crap" hahaha

yeah
My fav is either Applejack or rainbow, followed by rarity or pinkie or twilight, and fluttershy coming in last
...
boo
dat OH MY
well
that's it?
/me prepares to be mobbed by flutterfans
(yay, intended reaction achieved! (boo))
Pinkie Pie and Applejack are the best
dissapoint
booooooo
all the other ones are equal
Twilight is cool
it's an IRCchat
Rainbow is cool
Flutter is cool
and..
uhm
hey misti
hows the other one called
I dont like how much focus twilight gets in the show
I like all of 'em, but I'd put Rarity last if I had to make a list. That's the only notable thing
Rarity
Blums i cant belive im 5
is also cool
is there even one episode where twilight isnt in it?
LUNA WONT YOU CRY FOR ME!!!!
Yes!
rarity is the best pony :(
he's epic
mind telling me when this is live?
ok dermathil ...
Pinkie by "or" i meant i cant decide between you rarity or twilight
mrponiatior same here, except fluttershy would be last for me
FLUTTERSHY makes me wanna D'awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww so hard!
Sometimes
fluttershy would be second last to me
btw NewDCD, I be trying to find a rom of SRW Z2.
im not making a list
he been on z1 lots i hear
9>PSP
9>ROMs
-makes a list-
9you mean ISOs
>not isos
9also
9guys

I think I may have found a good emulator, but the game itself I got problems to get my hands on.
17...?
18...?
?
Oh no
32
nah dermathil pSP emus just aren't good
She was in 17

9close your Celestia Radio window and play the stream guys
9trust me on this.
"rarity's easiest"
lol, i just tuned in. "most buckable stallion = Rarity"
Rarity is easy, no kidding
>stallion
lol
newdcd r u celestia radio-an?
/me is already taken by somebody else (shocking, isn't it?)
cuz it will be like 5 second delayed : /
everyone knows it's Big Macintosh
12yes by me :)
who?
Well, she is the main of the mane six
Twi
oh
duh
Nah
she has the most screen time
Well, I guess she's the "mane character" after all, even if some episodes don't revolve arpund her
the question is
Twilight is onscreen like 50% of the time
/nick someone_else
then, surprisingly, applejack has the next highest
I like the cmc more than some of the mane 6
ugh
is there any pony that didnt appear in every episode??
yeah
9does this intermission music fit or what?
<^RainbowDash> u want a cupcake
yeah ,sure
RBD
eh not adding
look before you sleep had only Twi, AJ and Rarity in it
oh yeah

newdcd - i'm impressed
Wtf is going here?
it's only like 2 second delay
but other episodes too
was aj in green isnt your color?
I swear, my computer is TRYING to piss me off
Applejack has second most screentime because shes awesome
Why is prison on the stream?
it seems like an episode that she wouldnt be in
/me is already taken by somebody else (shocking, isn't it?)
Fluttershy has the least screen time?

rdASH I GUESS
why wasnt Luna in more episodes
>They all fucked and then everypony came!
RDash i guess *
Dman, i did it
Though Cheerilee was already ina prominent enough role in 18
I could see an episode with Cheerilee playing a more-than-minor role, since she's been seen talking to Twilight and has had more than two lines
just aint dont make sense
Cheerilee teaching Luna how a microwave oven works
dr whoofs has the least screen time

but who knows

I prefer the former personally
good question
Octivia, derpy hooves, bonbon, colgate, lyra, berry punch, lilly, dr whoof, rainbow day, sunset bliss, etc. All fan names
and why, drf? >:
>.<
maybe we herdminded?
I ate too much
nice
http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/07/kim-jong-il-has-hackers-farming-mmos-for-in-game-coin-and-we-a/ < LOL
colgate?
>nearly unlimited supply of food
Roseluck is /not/ a fan name though :D :D :D And neither is Lily
Colgate
I'm like a dog :/
This show is epic!
Yea I found that weird
hmm
Colgate is awesome
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE VIDEO!
._.
Both!
some call her romana
Just check the wikia page I linked
erwait, Lily is, but Daisy isn't
But Tutti Frutti is now my favorite background pony
I use it everynight
cna't find your quote in the chat
like I knew the toy was called Roseluck
can find mine thou
olwut
pic plz
Wat
I haven't even eaten in like 2 hours ago though
but then I noticed her actually say "rose" in the episode the other day and I was like OH WAO
silvermane, so i dont post here, CTRL F dman and find mine (i only commented like 3 times)
silvermane, where are you sending your reqs? in #CelestiaRadio?
just keep emptying my stomach *cough*
Peabnuts123, maybe they call her Rose for short :D
wut
She has a beautiful voice, imo.
well she could have just been calling her for short
PM Prison
*Roseluck does
ooh, Tutti Frutti is pretty
like they do with rainbow
http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110216030054/mlp/images/thumb/c/c7/Colgate_id.png/180px-Colgate_id.png Colgate
ohh
Queen!
No, Xiagu|Inkscape, that's what I meant
no, query Prison
.-.
GGgala http://ponify.me/chat/
here
I had never noticed them actually call her rose/roseluck in the show
Dman, it's not comments wher i ask him
Querying is PMing
Silvermane - :O
derpy hooves might not be fanname
God damnit cover blown again
derpy hooves started as a fanname
Well, Roseluck is the actual name tho
Well, Derpy Hooves started as a fanname
won't know till season 2 is released and they actually call her by name though
So does that mean DRF is a bulimic now?
right, TGPFluttershy is right
yeah
she was originally ditzy doo or something
10http://www.pokewiki.de/images/f/fe/Ho-oh2.png
10that
I hope it's Derpy
DAT IMPRESSION
``Oh no, the evil enchantress has cursed them /all/''
>impression of celestia
Lawl
>trolololol
so dumb
Didn't Ditzy Doo come after it?
no
but Faust said they would probably call her Ditzy Doo
Shes an evil enchantress!
trololol isgold
that's why I said cough
I dunno why, I like Ditzy... maybe because everyone makes her out to be a retard when I think she's just clumbsey
NewDCD, you need to let that guy die.
Everyone?
ditzy is an affable sweetheart in all her fan renditions
Guys there's no way they're going to actually address Derpy by name in S2, she's just going to be Where's Waldo-ing in the background
And then there are stuff like DJ Pon3
9Dashite: Shinn is cool. The rest of SEED is mostly shit.
Shinn is a whiny asshole. He sucks.
So much.
%
I laugh... don't they know what internet 1337 speak is
He needs to get punched in the face more often.
percentage of newdcds rage?
Pon Three... /laugh
When is S2 going to air, anyways?
Xiagu don't say that!
9>complaining about Shinn
9>not about Jesus or Assram
Well, Vinyl Scratch works for her too, I suppose
"Our bronies, hang out too. (come on bronies) Cuz they know we're awesome fillies! (come on every pony)"
Hey Dermathil look what's on
dont crush my dreams
mfw the stream here is ahead me
3 is E in 1337 >_>
1000 years from now when the stars aid her escape
Equestria Gurls
silvermane wat
hey, did you hear that about Bronystate?
it's 2 sec behind me last i checked
ha ha
I been watching for the last 5 minutes.
ha...
(gurren lagann :P)
and I know
9also Dashite
I like DJ PonE better then Pon3 imo
>2000 >not 150000
http://youtu.be/U3qS0odekuU fished product of this http://youtu.be/5Hm3MF0U9v0
I think it's actually DJ Pon-3
Dj Pon3 needs more screentime
Damn you monster guy! Why couldn't you hit Shinn instead?!
9Shinn is awesome in SRWZ's plot
yeah in equestria girls they said "DJ pon-3"
lol this is epic
Well, that's how you say it anyway
>Shinn >awesome
9because Z basically fixed SRW
>mfw I missed Gurren Lagann's attack and I only noticed the enemy's attack
9DERP I mean SEED
>does not compute
9it fixed SEED and made Shinn awesome and Jesus and Assram bearable
if he dances the night away to numanuma, that was my idea
DJ-P0N3
9Dashite: it was SO GOOD it caused Fukuda to be BUTTHURT BEYOND REPAIR
can you turn down the game just a tiny bit?
lol silver
Hey SirSprinkles
i wonder
is there a non PG chat on this board?
But seriously

This is PG chat
Hmm... it better be NewDCD!

PENETRATION
All the time
Obviously
I'm getting display driver crashes on start up
the @ guys?
:/
But sometimes when they split away from us
The @ people are
I am the only one on at the moment :(
: / *
All those bounces were my computer crashing to reboot
Things get real wild
please no
@ = op and % half op
so everything else is a bot?
Or something like that I don't know irc
im gunna go
Needs more shoes on head
Also, Derpy kicks ya if you keep using CAPS constantly. Bans if the kicks ain't enough
i wonder
Bye homestar
dodge
No they are just busy.
plz do that
Hey Jazza!
ok den
ah
doo eet silermane
where do you Equestria Daily mods get all your stuff from?
silvermane *
but i thought bitzero was a mod or mod+
to news on the front page?
not a half mod
I'm tlaking to someone about it, or trying to
Probably just chat mods
What's the schedule NewDCD?
and i can't advertise Bronystate outright, but i could mention it
What, he's going to say pony penetration?
9SRW, SRW, SRW, SRW, and then some more SRW
YAY~
Yes he did
9fun fact: we're two scenarios from Kamina's death
Unless some of 'em are prereaders, dunno
This is the Mushroom
well
they might know
>mfw I already know that NewDCD
9just say "If you like SRW, you should check BronyState right around now."
well theres always chatlogs
(I did researches)
what
Probably, but they might enjoy the mystery, so they won't tell us.
>mfw WUT DA EFF
i imagine its alot of work to run a blog
dammit twilight
9Twilightjack
Maybe so
No more work than writing a journal.
Especially one quite heavy on fanfic
Bronies around the world
Bronies....BRONIES EVERYWHERE!
well obviously she jacked herself off to the chat
good thing sethisto has cereal velocity and another blogger to help him
I'm pretty sure Seth gets most of his stuff from emails and trawling ponychan occasionally?
and an army of pre-readers
Those are the pictures I took of Twilight on snowdon.
pretty much, xiagu
Lol if he had to read through all of the fics
warning would've been GOOD
why does luna have so many instrumental songs?
epicsauce
NO WARNING
question upon questions
:P
NEW ATTACK
i forgot an s there
like a web?
(well...)
The whole thing?
omfg they're eating her...
This Pwns
frequently on his blog posts he regrets not having time to read the fics so...
like imgur page or wherever u uploaded?
i dont think he reads them
Because this was easier.
Yeah
i never read fics
Because making songs and saying they're Luna related makes people listen to them
everytime i click a pic chat sends me bottom again gotta scroll up etc
>yfw LALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALA NOT HEARING THE RADIO
hallo
would be easier
well
it works
Hey your_waifu

NewDCD, mind putting the volume of the game slightly louder Pl0x?
9o cool

INB4 RainBro's bed has escaped out of the window.
10that's what we like to hear silvermane. Ciao everypony else
And obviously if I ask him to post about this animation once it's done, I can totally see he'll take a still shot with Trixie in it
i am not his bed
10also: Dari what the fuck are you smoking?
Thanks!
RainBroDash, are you leaving?
is this better than Filly?
yes it is Abom.

9>not cheering for Big O
So Pinkie hasn't done anything wrong.
WHEW

and the anti-pony
...and it was run by bronies
I freakin love ponies!

^rainbowdash Idk, it bothers me when people are like real men watch ponies. I think its that real men aren't afraid of watching ponies

for blank blank blank time?
that's cool
NewDCD in about 5 mins would you mind streaming the song? pretty please

NewDCD would you stream teh song if i linkied it?

Mongoose|dinner aww
Loving ponies doesn't make you a man or a woman or a gay. Loving ponies just means you love ponies.
It doesn't make you any more or less of a person.
but to the rest of my family
They're ok with it
I was just about to download that :P
cool
see
12you can?
12:D
I climbed Snowdon today. :)
It took me a while to realize that I did indeed love the show.
I'm way too scared to come out to anyone other than my friends who like the show
Well said.
12i think google's text to speech program is even more funny though
I realized it when Twilight first met Fluttershy.
When she did that squeek it was all over for me.
12since each language has like a different accent
I came out on facebook.
I thought the show was pretty good from the first minute
About loving the show...
I didn't realize it until pinkie fell over when they were confronting Nightmare Moon
I don't care at all
it's a damn show
Mongoose
good fucking call
Mongoose go to dinner
it's not a big life changing thing
I'm bout to go post on fb

Its just a show. I am glad that I found something I really love. I dont really care what everyone else things about it.
if anypony hates you for it
they are shallow as fuck
If anypony hates you for it then they are not a pony. They are a mcmeanie mean pants.
The quicker you finish dinner the quicker you can return to your job

dude, horse x dog is wrong
9in which Spike got sent to the Human World for protection
>mfw I suddenly understand the implications.
9because Ponyville got razed to the ground
Is this the party-happy-random pinkie or the saddy-frowny-sadsad pinkie or the insane-cutty-haha pinkie?
wat
BA-BAKANA
lolwut
9>mfw I meant that as "Wyvern"
hey, does anyone watch the show Community?
OOOOOH
Wyvern, very different then WyBurn
9and then he was sent with the Element of Magic in his power
9end result, SPIKE BECOMES A KAMEN RIDER
9well
Spike in human world and then comedy ensued
/me gives D_man his star-shaped glasses while he puts on his V-shaped glasses.
9it's kind of like Heisei Riders, which corrupt words like that
THAT WAS FILLING
and good
9because it's a (Green) Fire Based Magic Type Rider
second bowl of Frosted Flakes = delicious
9geddit?
Frosted Flakes
do want
wait.
The saddy-frowny-sadsad Pinkie induces ``MUST HUG'' emotions of alarming strength in me :/
Didn't you already play on that map NewDCD?
/me now has star-shaped glasses
she makes me want to hug her too
I have no idea where they came from, but I found a box of them, so naturally I must nom
9haven't
I'm going to copy-pasta my fanfic, and edit the Sex-Change scene
You haven't?
Oh
It reminds me heavily of another scenario then.

/me I walked down the path, enjoying the crisp fall air.
Can't load it
whaaa
^except ponies
/me I was exhausted from another day of work. It seems like everypony wants pizza these days. Thank Celestia i'm done for today, I don't think i could stand another order. Every pizza has such weird customization, and the customers seem even weirder.
giant pic is giant
/me I mean seriously, why are half of the pizzas ordered with a hole in the middle?
>3 MB
9"A MAN'S ANGER....."
/me I glanced through the tangled mess of grey hair covering my face, towards my front door. I smiled, knowing I'd finally get a chance to rest. I had a box on my back, dinner for me and... her. It was safely strapped to my vest, which, ehem, /proudly/ declared me Pizza Pony of Little Celestia's Pizzeria
9"SA-SA-SAKURETSU CUT!"
....... Ponies = Reese's Puffs > everything
>theme. BREAK THROUGH FATE AND DESTINY, SHAPE YOUR PATH WITH YOUR DRILL!! EVEN IF YOU DIE!!! ONCE THE PATH HAS BEEN SET, WALK IT TO VICTORY LIKE A MAAAN!!!!!
It gave me a 403 and said "lol no hotlinks"
^^
"Princess celestia is the ONLY pony with BOTH pegusai wings and a unicorn's horn"
/me Honestly, I hate this job. I'm only doing it for the bits, so that I can put myself through college, as a master's degree in Psychology isn't cheap .Seems like every day someone tries to pay me... in an alternative manner.
Luna. 9.9
9DERP
lol
/me Why, I remember this one time, I was delivering a Pizza Cake to some guy named Goatees, man his parents must hate him, and this weirdo was outside his house with a camera. Apparently, he was expecting something film worthy.
How about THIS http://static.minitokyo.net/view/46/00/395046.jpg
9I'm still working on making it look good
tell that to hasbro and their official pincess celestia video =P
Lol
Hasbro is kinda fail, we all know that
Blums: that video is from before the series actually started
No hotlinking 403 error again D_man
marylin pie is cute
I mean, sure, the show is great, but hasbro is a little dumb
It works for me.
the video wasn't wrong, it's just outdated now :p
no wait, that's Greylinda
dermathil hmm working for me from here
Well cabbage luna was introduced from the very start of the episode so they could have left that only part out?
/me I still shudder whenever I picture the leather bit in his mouth. Gah, so creepy. Although, sometimes /she/ likes some interesting things... Realizing that I had been standing outside for 4 minutes, I rushed towards my door, carefully shouldering it open.
/me With a light flutter, I set the box down on the floor, and shrug off my vest, hanging it up on the wall. Next to it goes my hat, stained with peanut butter and cake batter.
Looks cool DCD.
I might go to bed now.
9I'm still not happy with it though
... Cabbage Luna?\
pics look very good newdcd ^_^

"Well cabbage, luna"
Luna was banished in the moon

/me I sigh once more, glad to be home. You know, I'd have already started my own practice if it wasn't for her urging me to get my masters degree.
9SilverMane: it was a request

Just 60 secs more

9o shit
9it's oldschool mecha Twilight Sparkle
92% counte rhit chance
oldschool mecha twilight sparkle?
Has anyone done a TTGL crossover fic for FiM yet?
OH SNAP
exaclty. a cabbage form luna
So very bored... :(
or maybe... luna wearing a cabbage?
I don't think a big one has been done yes FF.
what are you talking about NewDCD?
*Yes
I should move to australia
*Yet
How do you wear a cabbage :v
just so I can be with Jazza
or luna eating cabbage?
I was thinking of doing a Bebop one, but not for Happy Luna
N'aww
Luna is a cabbage. Do it
so just like how fluttershy is a tree?
bebop
Then you can do what you're doing in person
cowboy.. bebop?
Somepony shop a cabbage into Luna's two line scene
There's already a pony bebop
yes
And then Twilight is an egg
with AJ
Because I can't see Luna as Edward Hau Peplau Tivrusky III
that's what i want
we need more FML
. . . . . .
but why a cabbage?
Fluttershy...
A beaver
just Celestia head nuzzling a cabbage, top caption being ``I'm so sorry'' and bottom caption being ''I missed you so much''
FMA*
lawl
hahaha
dat typo
Zeptometer: why socks?
I am very serious when I say this: MY DAD WAS ON TV!!!:D
Freudian slip
perfect typo, right?
Why pinecones?
My Little Alchemist?
looooooool
cabbage
Why does it matter? xP
Fruedian Slip; where you say one thing and mean your mother.
Lol.
:O
:P at least there is a reason for fluttershy being a tree
Just do it
I'm waiting for Hoennshy to be completed before I read it.
We'll meet someday Mongoose
DOOOO ITTT
Why don't you make a tree, and get out of here
same
Then you can do it all day long
Of Mares and Magic finished with epilogue
[22:43]	<Blums>	Well cabbage luna was introduced from the very start of the episode so they could have left that only part out?
There is a FMA crossover on EQD, I never read it though.
9so did One Last Quest
I'm not huge on Twixie fics
03I've been on TV like 3 times
03:P
yeah
>Idort friend links to one rule 34 pic as he often does. >i clikc to see wtf it is, probably laugh at it as normally do. >my face when I see this one rule34 artwork. >instaclose, but idea + picture burned into my eyes. >Am I becoming attracted to ponies? Of course not! I'd never do that! ... I don't want to do that
people couldn't see the invisible comma between cabbage and luna
good fer you Danny
D_Man, don't make me link you Fun For Two Fillies, starring Twilight and Rainbow Dash
Maybe it's because my fanon is that Twilight and Trixie are sisters or cousins.
Do it silvermane
D_man hahaha
03way to be a jerk about it
Okay MrPoniator Tannen
Would that sentence have been clearer if I had put quotes between between and cabbage and cabbage and and and and and luna and after luna?
lol
didn't that happen with Friendship is Sexy last week?
oh yeah
03what really pissed me off though
I can't wait
That joke made about as much sense a screen door on a battleship.
03when I 8was in London, right
PEOPLE- Y U SPEND FKING HOURS MAKING SUCH 'good' PICTURES OR FKING PONIES?
03the parade was being broadcast basically all ove rthe world
D_man, i don't have it. i was bluffing. basically, it's involving dash getting to explore her OTHER side
I know
gggala - yes ;__;
Actually, my preferred shipping is Rarijack
03and when the camera panned to where I was, the sun glared off a tuba and blocked my face :(
read half of part 1 and was like ...dont trust mahself with this
it keeps the space flies out of the airlock
03so i'm like "There's my body right there, but um, you can't really see me"
13LOL
RariJack was my first ship, in Swayback Mountain
Atomicbrony LOL
...not that kind of battleship.
silvermane ... other? with colt or filly i've seen 'em all...well not em all, but many
Like, the water kind.
D_man you have stared into the abyss and the abyss is clopping to yuo
03it's still fun to say I was on international television though
... thats what I was thinking
I don't really ship much other than spike and rarity kinda, but rarity doesn't seem interested
what other kind of battleship is there?
/me 's sentence was grammatically correct
GGgala I KNOW! I MUST FIGHT IT
Space battle ship.
I DON'T WANT IT BUT IT WANTS ME
oh
GO GURREN LAGANN
oh.. keeps the seaweed out of the cooling system?
Haven't read Swayback Mountain, but I did like A Bedtime Secret and Rarity's Rodeo
A PART OF ME WANTS, BUT LIKE 5% ONLY. I MUST FIGHT ITTTT I DON'T WANT
GIVE EM A TASTE OF THEIR MEDICINE
D_Man, twilight finds a spell book, creates gender that matters, Dash gets penis, then they fuck. it was a comic-hentai-line
You coulda jsut said screen doors on a spaceship
blums dont try to make sense out of it
...
he didnt mean space ship
Even though those do technicaly make sense
YOU ALL SUCK.
hum, I can't wait till the day ED has a post showing the airdates of Season 2... that will be a day to behold lol
silvermane -- ....... fuck. 2 girls on each other like that used to really turn me on.
I don't suck :(
The space ship with the space guns that shoot the space bullets in space?
MrPoniator and I are going back to our homes to watch "Back to the Future" again.
SwayBack Mountain is by Butterscotch Sundae. and A Bedtime Secret, interesting
Y PEOPLE DO DIS? CREATE 'really good artwork with impressive touches' OF FKING PPONIES FKINC FUCKING EACH OTHER >_<
Yes holy Junkie, and its powered by turbofan engines
Why that movie?
Because, you don;'t want loose bits to be blown aroudn the whole ship by your ventalation system
*whacks everyone with a deactivated beam katana*
...
thus i predict spaceships will have screen doors
9D_man: it's called freedom of expression
MrPoniator because it's amazing
Because internet/science
that goes for very descriptive, 'colourful' fics too
i dunno, i haven't ooked at any X-rated stuff of ponies in a long time
duh
"Make like a tree and get out of here?"
>mfw I think I saw the comic Silvermane mentionned already. Accidentally. Because Ponibooru decided to derp its filters
"Screen door on a battleship?"
NewDCD - i'm not against it i find it hillarious and awesome that people do this
"HELLO, MCFLY?!"
i'm just worried for myself now
No... SPACE... ENGINES...
/me going to read Maturity now
SilverMane: Rarity's Rodeo is by Somber.
Ah, okay
make like a bannana and leave
And because it's awesome.
what? turbofan engines are totally viable on a spaceship
Oh, I was AFK, i only cvaught the battleship one
which is not obvious
Maturity is good. Just finished reading it a bit ago.
I find FiM rule 34/clopfics freakin' hilarious.
D_man, it's just a matter of saying no. I have gained excellent self control regarding that due to ponies
same Aponymous
wait, you never said make like a tree
Spreading Your Wings, and Hers was epic though
until just then
ooh he did
I thought you were being sarcastic
silvermane - i read that one
i wasnt here for that
hence, "I know"
anywyas
'7.Her tongue slipped into his mouth and he shared a long blissful kiss with her that seemed to go on forever. She broke off and stepped away from him. She stood with her flank facing the dragon, turned her violet-maned head and gave him a sultry look.'
no, he said Make a tree and get out of here cracky
made me lul so much. that's what I used to be like
i think i'm talking to myself now
03http://oi54.tinypic.com/1zqwxoy.jpg
he said
but now lately it's less luls and more pomfs ;__; but i don't want this
but not him
it was the other him
im confused now
Because I quote movies without knowing where the quotes come from, I'm just that
not hthe first him
oh. right
silvermane D: Y
See, when MrPoniator said that, I immediately conjured up Biff from "Back to the Future," because he always screws up those lines
Hence the "screen door on a battleship" reply
WHATS GOING ON?
make like Mr. Sir Henry Mo- *notices the rating* ...and... i don't know where this joke was going.
i dont know
Not a clue
okay. moving on then
We're ****ing up euphamisms.
lol
That's what.
it's from Maturity
Awesome
Luna is not a Cabbage because that makes no sense.
now that we have that settled.
*munches on a cabbage*
It's only that one paragraph. I liked Maturity. SGR does good Spike stories.
D_man, you just need to get to the point of Bronydom where teh ponies are no longer a thing, but rather a part of your life
Cabbages are delicous, because that makes perfect sense!
It's a dream sequence
12lol
DELICIOUS
12:P
so you're saying Luna tastes delicious?
silvermane i know lol read that whole fic. was actually interesting - what WILL happen to spike
/me crawls on Mongoose and rests...
?
No
You guys wanna get high? don't forget your towel.
Luna is not a Cabbage
Towlie!
Honestly, my main requirement for shipfics is that the relationships are done well
12could have been worse drf
Silvermane - implying not already since ages ago
gtg
/me holds Jazza close to him
12wb LMH
Luna is cabbage wut?
...you're a towel.
We will make luna a cabbage
luna is NOT a ccabbage
/me derps
you see
Luna is pure awesomeness, that is all
THanks :P
Luna's a towel?
well, pure awesomeness with a god side of cute
03I gave them a 20% warning level then blocked them
03after that
or.. maybe we'll just have luna wear a cabbage
South Park reference
or eat a cabbage
03see, proof I'm not perverted enough to just click on random porn links :P
but silvermane - lately less 'lol look at that it's funny because of how ridiculous it is as they're ponies / wow that's some neato artwork / fic,' and now it's more and more *pomf*. WHY.jpg
When there's ship in a fic I can't have it be the focus of the story.
9Time to Banish some fuckers.
Maybe it's because I'm a big sappy romantic.
Or it'll infect your PC ;P
TO THE MOON
Like the Pony Psychology series. That one I like a real lot.
I should put a reference in a flash video...
Luna + cabbage = get it done.
Cabbage -> Delicious
INB4 Everyone tries the link in the image
i read that one, loved it
9BINNISHED.
why not lettuce?
BONNOSHED TO THO MOON
Cabbag -> ¬Luna
And dressing
Fluttershy being a tree doesn't make any more sense than Luna being a cabbage
also
Luna -> ¬Cabbage
Only difference is that it was stated in the show
because cabbage merchant from avatar
why you be dissing my luna
?
=/
Fluttershy said she wants to be a tree
MY CABBAGES
The Ditzy/Derpy chapter was interesting.
latest one? not read it yet
THEREFORE
9time for Valkyrie/Veritech, mofos
got it open in a tab rite now :3
haven't read the Derpy chapter yet
Read it. Now.
Luna may or may not be delicious
so fluttershy would technically be a furry in the pony world
*munch*
Cabbages are not sufficent evidence for either hypothisis
Fluttershy is /not/ a tree, silly. She'd /like/ to be a tree. Fluttertree is a tree.
/me sweatdrops
I got an ipod. I'll use it.
...she's a cabbage.
DAT MECH
...
On a completely different note AdultSwim voted us less creepy than furries
I'm a stone
Pony cabbages
Now that is an awesome mech too.
I've been downloading the PDF version of Past Sins to my nook.
if fluttershy would like to be a tree, what would butterscotch want to be?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eXnY12ZCP4 metal gear plus space =0
It's true! We're more creepy than the word moist, though. :c
We're not creepier than furries
/me goes back to his bucket.
Wait... what do that make furry bronies?
Code Geass?
just shop pony heads sticking out of the cabbages from the cabbage merchant from avatar
fluttershy is tree man.
LESS creepy, officially stated on AdultSwim
furries? no we're cabbies
"MY CABBAGES!"
MY CABBAGES!
Gode Ceass
Overkill?
/me is now a bucket.
Is that Code Geass?
9eyup

OH SNAP ITS ALIVE!
I want such a comfy bucket as Atomic's

Ooh!
/me returns brohoof aswell
they're confusing me Xiagu
Welp, Tenari posted something Valve related and now we get something valve related from EqD
and then if someone wants to know what i did with my life, i can hand them 200 pounds of pony fic
Also, since I mentioned Rarity's Rodeo, some of Somber's other fics have the [Sad] tag. Do not underestimate that tag.
Every bucket comes with a bucket
What are their titles?
BIG O!
hahahaha
I love [sad] stories, and i do mean LOVE. I don't know why, bu ti just can't not read them

And every bucket that comes with a bucket is free.
GO BIG O
Derpy is epic!
but not water.
So, free bucket.
Is that a bundle deal?
9Mane, print mine
if it makes me cry, all the better. i find it hard to cry at real life things
The only thing better than a bucket... Is a bucket handle
Simply Rarity; Blood, Sweat and Tears
There's a song in Finnish
I try to avoid sad stories, I occasionally make exceptions though.
water is 50$ a bucket
okay, i'm back
omfg, read both of those FreezeFrame
loved them
lol silvermane
"Drop doesn't kill, and you can't drown in a bucket"
Loved them, too, but was bawling my eyes out.
hello
never heard of em FF.
and silvermane i'm now looking for the twi rainbowdassh one curse yoouuuuu>_<
Simply Rarity was... beautiful
I'd disagree with that ^
Guess Atomic's bucket prevents drowning
03LOL, I doubt it would be able to give me viruses, I have Malwarebytes :P
And you know exactly where the waterworks came on Simply Rarity.
DAI-GUARD
it's not fanfic D_man, it was a comic-esque hentai thingy
GO
It has a lid
o...k...silvermane...
Yay MB
if you wear it properly under water a bucket can be used as an airpocket
*munches on the sandwich of your defeat*

9yeah that was Asakim
/me is never interested in sex or "Shipping"
I like bucket
I know, but I'm fine with the regular xD
9we played a bit with him yesterday
You like the concept of a bucket?
9a nerfed version of him, but yeah
At least I have the chance to ruin Windows 7 first :P
Shipping simply refers to any sort of romantic relationships
but you cant tilt the bucket at all
(4-H building at Iowa State Fair. Yaaaaay.
asakim! yes!
I know what it means.
I like to take that concept and reduce it to an object
/me thinks Nittany_Tiger is missing out on some of the greatest fics there are. If you want non-sexy shipping, i can find some good ones
I like to take that object and put it in my videos
and put it in my videos
you have to scan EVERY DAY then
I don't want Shipping. Most of it is probably lesbian.
Mongoose link one of your videos
i'm bored
i'll watch
Since MLP's cast is mostly female.

Ponibooru why y no work
Same goes for bronibooru
But newdcd you don't like clop fics, right? "that shit's not cool nigga" right?
I'm writing a weird ass Spike/Rarity fic about murder.
I love parodies of some of the excesses of shipping.
Lame got excited
9yeah, the stuff I write is pretty tame
Like the two parodies of "Rainbow Dash ships with everypony"
9I like romance, that's it. I've always been a hopeless romantic.
I haven't started my "disaster" fic.
Scootaloo....
I could give you Scootagoose
I haven't scanned in weeks
Well, I don't want to call it a "disaster" fic.
I need dem scootaloo

At the beginning

She must hate you
9Aponymous: DON'T CHALLENGE ME TO DRAW THAT BRO I ALREADY AM HAVING A HARD TIME DRAWING WYBURN AND ALSO THE MANE CAST AS A SENTAI
03what did HML do to be called an idiot :P
And y u care about my security
03I only call people idiots who actually deserve it
was that Double Rainbow the one with RBD and RBD and RBD and RBD and
Deal with your own problems first :)
you are right
why should I care
9Harmony Sentai Equestranger
NewDCD: I CHALLENGE YOU
I could look that one up, GGala, but really, I don't want to. It's just too hard, and I don't like it that way.
TO DO IT
... gggala haven't heard of the clopfic
you could get infected and have your machine be so bad that its required to be wiped out for all I should care
Cutie mark Chronicles
I wanted to draw a pic for Controlling the Weather for the author because I could imagine it.
It's obviously not on EqD
That was episode 23, Cutie Mark damn you Mongoose
lol
03that I use IE a lot too
03and I also haven't had viruses in ages
I've seen enough tornadoes all around to draw them well.
I avoid it like the plague
03IE 8 is not that bad
that ain't the onlly page i refresh a bajillion times a day thou
was there ever a clopfic on Eqd?
03I avoid Chrome like the plague
03with its buttugly GUI
9DAT 70S
There's been one or two that skirts it, but EqD does not allow clopfics
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lhXnuNP8g4
Some borderline ones, Seth keeps Cloppy stuf on Equestria After Dark.
Which is why I go there for fanfic
I avoid FF for many reasons :P
'inb4: more holes than swiss cheese
HELLO ALL WHATS GOING ON
I don't like clopfics
sup, capslockhero
o/` He's a CAPS LOCK HERO o/1
Now just need some dem pics of Scootie
chrome's UI is OK, compared to say, opera
That's one reason, replace holes with leaks :p
03I like Firefox because of the customization and the fact that it Just Works® with most sites
(To the tune of Jukebox Hero)
HES A CAPS. LOCK. HERO
oh ponibooru works omg
XD
so does chrome
FreezeFrame, you can get clopfics easilly, but EQD is good for generally excellent fanfics. they screen crap out, which i love
So does chro
Hi CAPSLOCKHERO, welcome to awkward.
Yeah
I like Firefox for about the same reasons
and they have linked those Shipping Compilations
AWKWARD?
and IE and Opera and every other non-broken browser
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/129192830445154805.jpg
WHY IS AWKWARD?
customization and that it actually follows standards
we're talking about clopfic and mechs
D_man: >When Twilight accidentally pulls her and Rainbow Dash's male counterparts into their own universe, Dash experiments with heterosexuality
/me sneezes

GGgala - wow
NO MORE OF THAT GGGALA
GGgala, what story is that?
I used to think i'd miss the extensions when i switched to chrome
Addons are being ported, so not as much as a problem now :P
I have some
but now, not as much
that isn't On a Cross and Arrow is it?
double rainbow apparently
I love Scootaloo
9Dermathil: I'd be happy I wouldn't have to download the movie. I have it in my D: Drive
13I'm neutral to pretty much all Browsers, I mainly use Firefox simply because it's the one I've used the longest and I don't like unnecessary change
Nope
no silvermane
03Chrome is also significantly slower to Firefox to me
13Anyway, goodnight all <3
^
03also ^ at what AE said
double rainbow clopfic apparently
Found already the necessary pics
Night
night AE :3
On a Cross and Arrow has bi-curious Rainbow Dash/Rainbow Blitz
personas are not done in Chrome
Oh lawd, double rainbow, the OTHER one, huh? link please, i am now horrendously curious
SilverMane, D_man - this one! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o7Wo4qlWMGJyADdepy28xzoiIK8X-NuUIAVIZmS_C28/edit?hl=en_US

I WOULD LIKE TO SEE TROLL 2 ON A MOVIE NIGHT
Lol Personas
just linked a clopfic
you have to stick with whatever UI that Bill Gates or the Google team feels you should have
Troll 2? Oh god
Themes plz
But bronibooru refuses to work now (doesn't load images), so yeah
03I use addons like Oldbar and Winstripe Realfox to get rid of that stupid ugly dfeault FF3 theme
9so what movies won yesterday, anyways?
03EW THE BACK BUTTON BEING BIGGER THAN THE FORWARD BUTTON
he just wants more pictures of *a certain anime character*, that's all
D_man, i could link you such horrible things...
03That just looks fricking ugly to me
THEY'RE EATING HER!
Well use CHROME
03no.
Do you want to be convicted of war crimes, CAPSLOCKHERO?
AND THEN, THEY'RE OGING TO EAT ME
It doesn't have that issue :3
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO~d
GGgala - scrollscrollscrollscr-
if you can get that in chrme, it'd be less objectionable for him

Scott Pilgrim, NewDCD
:D
Motherbucker I'm awesome
9o sweet
and This Island Earth
all I hate about Firefox is the memory leaks
(1955 MOVIE)
9I had read the comic but not watched the movie
This Island Earth, oh lawd
WAR CRIMES?
I DID NO SUCH THING
9...now that is going to be a pain in the ass to get
DON'T YOU DIE MAZINGER Z
MAYBE
I have seen Chrome
You want to get a bunch of people to watch Troll 2
its UI is about the UGLIEST I have seen
I think This Island Earth is going to be the oldest movie we'll have watched on BMN.
PHOTON BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMU!
not troll 2
Once is enough

03http://i53.tinypic.com/29fqvbt.png
it's minimalist
newdcd not even 5 seconds of searching
03I like that flook
03-f
I hope if I get picked on the lotto I get picked for B movie
lawl
I have seen Firefox, it's UI is too bulky and screen hogging
03also notice the separate arrows for back/forward
Well, the older versions :P
You'll find it fine, imo, newdcd
9Dman
I know my B movies.
03I had to get the NoUnButtons addon to get that to work >_>
9you did not see the seeders and leechers
9you silly filly
03it literally takes me like 4 addons just to get the newer Firefoxes to be even remotely good looking :/
Hey again.
10
Looks like IE now :P
good enough
9that shit is undownloadable there
you gottawweek
... oh wheere you are
03not really
03it looks like Firefox 1.5
03but OI like old looks

OHAI DENIED_EXISTANCE
03hence why I like mIRC 6.21
Playing some more robot games eh?

I am sticking with Firefox
despite the memory leaks
Not much
Denied_Existance? In my bronystate?
>MFW I mispell Existence
03Windows Aero is prolly one of the few exceptions, I like it a lot better than Luna or whatever XP's was called

yes, Silvermane.
Have been talking about doing some LP's for circuit mane.
I'm using Aena

03LOL what
DID ANYTHING HAPPEN?
Aka. Aero that is screwed
not really Caps

No transparency ;P
newdcd - not gonna link, but found a few on filestube ; )
03what'd you do to it
03oh
ROBOTS WERE BLOWN UP
03that's what I have
03EW TRANSPARENCY
EW AERO
03Didn't you see the dark blue on the bottom?
^
AND NOW I HAVE ADVERTISEMENTS THAT I CANT EVEN SEE >.<
03I turned transparency off :P
I used to read fanfic like crazy, then I kept finding bad ones, then someone showed me FanFiction Friday, which scared me away for years
crashing
Sad pmv time! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_G6wi23Hfc
Aero never crashes
03it doesn't crash for me LOL
03ge[t a good video card
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_G6wi23Hfc
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
I couldn't find this video in the library, maybe Twilight knows more.
03even on my mom's 9400GT it works fine
How do tears look in the style of the show?
Ive seen it happen a few times
LOL
03but god dang it NVIDIA
Fanfiction Friday? I think I've heard of that. Scary shit.
On my mom's 8300gs, it works
Now FiM got me to read fanfics again (though still wary)
Silvermane, what you talking about Scottish composers?
I haven't got a video card \o/
>mfw there is a transformer in SRW Z2
03I actually needed to use the TV-out (S-video) and I couldn't get it to work >:|}
WHATS FANFICTION FRIDAY
03well then go get one
dermathil WAT?
9Dermathil: You mean a Veritech/Valkyrie
where
oh
>NOt enough power
9from Macross
OH
My Laptop doesn't have a video card either :D
It's a feature on Topless Robot where the columnist tries to MST horrible fanfictions.
Lolhow
LOLWAT
Aren't there cards that use less than 75 watts :P
wattery and bully i think
12drf to buy an apple computer
*bubbly
12so you can show us why it's so bad
so macross is in fact the Japanese Transformers. At least the Japanese part of it makes me think it is way better already
@FreezeFrame Acronym means what?
wibbly?
9No Dermathil
ac·ro·nym An abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words and pronounced as a word (e.g., ASCII, NASA)
9Transformers is the Japanese Transformers
Denied_existence
Flash-like
XD
He'd hammer and throw it on the ground before it would arrive
D_man I meant he MST acronym
yeah I know they're actually just a blue stroked shape being jittered every frame but whatever
Basically, heckle it to wash out the bad taste.
Umm...
Mr. Technical
Inb4: smash it on the ground day
i know denied_existence, twas a torlolol
Ah, ok
: )
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t7I6DTny6A&NR=1
Urgh.
that's how
I read one once, made me feel dirty, can't remember what it was called.
CIA, idly, is not an acronym, as no one says it "sigh-a". It is an initialism
that's not really what I was asking, but I guess it's not really possible to get a good answer through text
Probably for the better
9BANISHED TO THE MOON
9PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Aponymous: Not the Sesame Street one?
oh isn't Fanfic Fridays on Celestia Radio?
My Steam pic is crying Lyra, but I still need to get a new power source for my comp >.<
I was amazed when Fanfiction Friday did a TwiDash one week
BANISHMENT PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWNCH
woops, wrong one lol
Just check when the phoenix dies
So I dunno
Oh, hey, i see Luna
lol
I ment to post the one where Fluttershy catches the pheonix as it turns to ash =x
(DO NOT LOOK THAT ONE UP. I IMPLORE YOU, IF YOU VALUE ANY FAITH IN HUMANITY.)
Luna en la Luna :3
NewDCD Y'all pretty backed up with Op interviews?
No, it had some comic characters,it was about some fucked up sport.
I washed it from my mind.
9Denied: watchoo mean?
THE MAGICKS OF BRAIN BLEACH
the pheonix and the ash with fluttershy crying: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsf6s-FxrmU
right, thanks, time to acquire screencaps
Um, when are we gonna get the emails? Been almost a week now and I see no sign of life
/me has the Octavia raspberry pic for her icons everywhere. Awesome.
That one is beyond even brain bleach.
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsf6s-FxrmU
OHGAWDNO
Twilight told me this video is about Fluttershy - (crying) 2
except eqd, seems it uses my blogger icon
Hmm. Link Octavia?
is it neccisary to identify EVERY link? XD
NewDCD I am just wondering if y'all are backed up with mod apps. I still haven't received a reply so that is what I assume is happening
obviously
OH GOD TALKING ABOUT IT MADE ME REMEMBER MORE! FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
No, but I'm curious
No way
GOOGLE CHROME IS BEING STUPID, GIVING ME ADVERTISEMENTS THAT ARNT THERE, I CAN ONLY HEAR THEM
Since we don't have a bot that identifies YouTube links automatically
AND YES I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GORRAM CAT
aw, they don't actually run down her face :/
9oh, reply about what? I haven't talked to the other mods about operations since Friday night
IM GETTING ALL RAGEY
BUT I CANT EXPRESS IT BECAUSE IM TALKING IN CAPS ALREADY
i dont think tears have ever run down a pony's face
Luna's
NewDCD Nevermind then.
And Celestia?
dat theme
Pinkie Pie

Except here were more of a geyser
9it's called "Kanjite Knight"

I have a headache...
NewDCD No, I am still waiting to be interviewed TO BE an operator/streamer.
NewDCD - denied_existence is waiting for a reply on when he will be interviewed to see if he becomes mod
There ya go
I can stare at that happy luna picture all day
Same as D_man and Denied_Existence in my case
9ooooooooooooh

So I could go around that
okay yeah they get waaay more than one tear each, you were right
I don't know, why are you squealing to Cupcakes? o_O
/me stares at Pyroh

Really.
Hi :)

YES!
Silvermane: Summersday is from "Quit Dragon Your Heels"
Really

He's been waiting as long as I have
That's like, oh boy
*hits Cupcakes pinkie pie with elements of harmony*
newdcd x dermathil xP
Not the kind Silvermane always has with RBD tho
9the other thing we need, Denied_Existence, is to know if you're available to stream the episodes
DERMATHIL Y U SO HERDMIND

Ah okay, thanks Aponymous. I might need to read that.
You should, it's pretty good.
Dermathil i guess it could be
Man, maturity's last dream sequence, right at the end is sad and chilling, much like all spike-grows-up stories.
Welcome myself.
The one about Twilight dieing was heart breaking
Welcome yourself

silvermane - i know ;__; so much emotion in dat fic
/me puts on The Best Night Ever

WB
The one where Spike has Statue!Rarity is.... weirdly heartwarming.
So... Anything good happening here?
/me goes bed
yeah.
that one's ... yea happy somehow
No I thought this chat would help me write something
Because He eventually unfreezes the Statue Rarity
AtomicBrony just went to bed
I d'awwed with an eyebrow cocked.
that he'll undo spell and die with her is just such poetic justice :3
and dies happily both with eachother.
User_7301 just left
that's good?
He became a bed

Lack of ponies if anything.

Who is the least developed of the mane cast?
A Summer Twilight, one of the hardest hitting stories i've read

All of them
Silvermane This is what now?
NEwDCD: SO MUCH WANT
Hey look Balloons! *points in a random direction* It's Celestia!

Applejack.

GARRYS MOD VIDEO EVENT ON EQD Yes!

i love me some sadfics, they get me thinking possitively instead of the happy fics making me depressed

Rainbow Dash? WHERE?!
I love what happens by default when using 7
9also Dman yfw you realize you can't go sleep
Hey look, ponies!
Hibernation everywhere*
FreezeFrame, it's because i have extreme empathetic tendencies. The emotions i feel in the stories, if written well enough, become real; the fact that they are fake hits hard once m ymind realizes it, and thus depression ensues after extreme happiness
Huhwhat?
/me points to rainbow dash
SOUP'S UP
Anal... what a nick name
EVEYPONY
I want soup

Anal is short for Anal Compulsive which is fancy talk for stuck up or something

I gotta be up at 6...
Silvermane - go to bed
some ponies like terrible movies, some ponies like terrible stories.
You wanna sleep right?
where is the robot that is orgasm-powered anyhow? I heard there was one of those in a SRW game.
Cupcakes was poorly written
I gotta be up by 6, too
but whatever
why is Blums trying to send us to the moon now?

Oh the puns

Too much sad and grimdark in the EqD fics

9IT'S SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTIME
TELL ME THE BOSS IS FINISHED BY GURREN LAGANN
I had a weird dream...
I wish I read more fics more often
PL0X

Maybe someone can make a fic from the point of evil characters who have to face a world that is slowly turning happylight?

Hiya Big Mac

Oh, I know trust.
I don't think that's true, unfortunately
well shucks, why doesn't kamina have a greater Seishin?
eyup is here!
See Poninator
Seeya*
They said it kept moving and I woke up once to find it by my cousin's head. He swore he never touched it.
It only heals 2K hp in SRW J though.
9Kamina so far has been the first one to get Nekketsu/Hot Blood
clopclopclop

Yes? And?
FreezeFrame: Twilight's Excitement? The clopfic version of Twilight's Experiment?
I KNOW
so i thought you had to use it?
No
"Ponies are cute."
They are
But ships aren't
well i guess kamina would still have his story here?
BUt what if you just don't field him for that mission?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/01/story-twilights-excitement_4682.html

Mm?
03but I need some really powerful antacid to get rid of this x.x
/me puts on a beret, because she looks hot in one
brb drink to stay up longer
Dashie DOES look cute in one, just not hot
Pinkie Pie hanging out with Mazinger Z, with a green lantern ring, and the dragon dagger (from MMPR)
but even then Dayakkaiser would've been awesome on that mission too.
That's one hot beret...?
steal aj's hat and wear that around
It must be on fire.
9FreezeFrame: when I read that shit I jizzed everywhere forever and it established my current love for the fandom

Bigmac, did you flee from the adventure?
Fast pony makes mongoose angry

I was off doing it6

I wonder why that poor dear Mitta is crying like that... oh well I have the key now.. I suppose i'll check out that nice old house now
also people, including my friends, say the dpad is too small - this is the people who play vidya 8 hours staight if not more and complete a videogame in one weekend. dude do other stuff too :P
I need to watch my recording of Blade Runner, then read Blade Trotter
newdcd- iplayed like 2 hours with m8 but not more

Hey Bonbon. You're going to LOVE the ending, the ponies there are an awful lot like you.
9but to me
also kage no tou or whatever is waaaay overrated

9the Wii is a serious dissapointment
good night freezeframe

tForever you say?
You deserve it....
Night Freeze
newdcd y u. i love standing infront of tv in red steel 2 setting motion detection to 'athletic' and jumping around, fking bringin my hand up like a baws to block
Sure thing!
Apparently, Maturity just got pulled from EqD
for example
in the ass
Freezeframe what?
Whats that? you want me to throw another pony into the fireplace?
I just refreshed, and it's not there.
Why i'd love to
no wai
Is it because of the console, or the games?
Rainbow dash? Oh... this will be fun
9I can't afford Wii Motion Plus
... it did as well
12seen it drf
So. What is happening in this channel?
/me maniac glares at dash
NewDCD - i got a 'nopackage' thingy for very cheap from ebay
what the hay
anyway, sleep. Good thing I already read it.
night
9my controller is a bit damaged and the 1-2 buttons don't work too well, and a new, Motion Plus integrated controller costs 65 bucks here
/me sighs @ comments
pulled? that happens?
9and I mean the games lineup
BAH!
9one game don't make a console
Apparently.
yeah that happens at times GGGala.
newdcd - i feel strongly about this: wii mote plus is AWFUL
/me still has a grudge on Bonbon
THere was a Naruto fic once. Was pulled too.
One game? WTF?
holysheit
Locke.
wii mote + motion plus is BOSS. feels EPIC in yer hand.
The general reader feedback wasn't good.
The authors nephew or whatever deleted it from everywhere he posted it.
03http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/pokmon-the-best-tip-you-could-get.jpg
Yeah?
Oh lighten up Rainbow Dash I was only ribbing you.
aww...
Scoot Scootaloo!
/me "Gee, Dash. I'm sure glad the dye washes out."
And that was because Sethisto put it up without going through prereaders.
Pfft.
!flip
9Dashite: I mean "the Wii doesn't have enough good games"
12watch there be an 80 dollar card in there
/me flies up in the air and does a backflip
/me lands on her back. Ouch!
Locke = FFVI's best character IMO
Get back to the Island, you noob.
skehehhehe
!Flip
/me flies up in the air and does a backflip
/me lands on her back. Ouch!
?
Ok thats it, i dont care if its done or not, i do NOT need more images
aw
I'm sorry, DerpyBot
/me looks to her side defiantly.
i keep stopping + deleting recording
ANYWAYS!
Doesn't have enough good games, or doesn't have enough games that you want?
when stuff go down?
Not like that dear.
9have you seen the Wii the last year and a half? The influx of new, good games is very rare
may be 12 there, but is 6am here
NewDCD: Super Mario Galaxy (1, not 2. 2 SUCKED for being a cash-grab) was great.
Yeah, it's died down this past year.
NewDCD i agree
9dude, the Wii is Shovelware Heaven. Don't try to deny this.
Galaxy 2 > 1
NDS and Wii haven't had much last year and a half
but I agree the last year was CRAP.
No purchase.
/me switches to Call of the Cutie voice
/me crosses her forehooves, holding herself upright with her wings.
LIKE the last good ds game was GHOST TRICK (amazing game) LIKE A YEAR AGO
But id my voice really as bad as you say?
I'm not denying that there is a metric fuck ton of shovelware on the system. There are good games on it as well.
you sound just fine bonbon
This year in gaming half-sucks.
GO DAI-GUARD
9what bothers me is that they're getting ready to replace the Wii already
/me has no wings
don't think lyra would have it any other way too
/me is a floating box
It's been 5 years...
Dman: That's a weird way of spelling Okamiden
A ridly withought wings is more of a raptor
Oh but raaaainnn bow daaash saaaiiid It was stuuuuuuupiiiiiddd
9when a good-games quota hasn't been reached. In comparison, the Gamecube had a lot of good games
i bought cowadoodee for xbawx and then downloaded for wii. i have wii zapper (amazon deal for 1 quid with links crosswbow trainan) . I enjoyed wii ver a LOT more
/me looks at her first with an "I dunno...Is it?" look, and switches to an "Mmm, yeah." look.
And it was definitely less than a year ago
/me starts fake-crying
she's just jealous
yeah, newdcd.
OOoooo hi BonBon, didnt see you there

FreezeFrame lol. I haven't actually played akomiden but never played okai
Jealous?
9plus Dashite, have you seen the bunch of pictures about people's Wiis collecting dust in the net?
okamiden okami *
she haaates meeee... *boo hoo*
9doesn't that tell you something?
jelly?
My voice is AWESOME.
9The Wii is a commercial success
ummmmm
>_>
Play Okami. It's great.
Nevermind
cuz i played 2 hours of okami and was all 'hmm ok'
She's just... Snotty.
9but the greatest failure in history from a core gamer perspective
it seemed like a well thoguht out and polished game thats for sure
/me breaks into more tears
9hence why I shifted more towards my PSP and PC

9when GOOD games come for the console
NewDCD - i am very jelly i know nothing about PSP homebrewan at ALL
9Reggie fucks us up
9so yeah.
IT isn't like the Wii seems to be headed for going out in a bang like the N64 with PAPER MARIO.
yup
/me nods at BonBon
With the exception of this past year, if you haven't been able to find something that you wanted to play on the Wii, it was your own fault.
p'haps
/me chucks a pinecone at BonBon's face
hey everyone
last year i have bought nothing
They've messed up this past year for sure.
Oh thank you Retsamoreh, you're my only real friend
9yeah, me and thousands of other gamers
/me is a clever girl
I hope you explode!
and downloaded cod, justdance1/2 for sister (haven't played 1 second of them) and uh
9don't be such a fanboy. I remember when I was like you, trying to defend the Wii.
actually, last year I got the two Resident evil games for wii.
9yet the Wii brought naught.
/me glomptackles retsamoreh I know you're just saying you love me!
9so I said "fuck this".
What's up with this Trixie eating pinecones nonsense?
OH and brawl USA cuz brawl EU was / is so behind in cheats. so USA has codes now
Someone! Stab her off of me!
Pinecones are nutricous
/me stabbity STAB stab
Hellllppppp~
wait wuh?!
Fanboy? I just don't like to see people shit on the console for having no games when that is clearly not true.
CODES IN MY BRAWL?!
9and stopped defending it
Oh
Ok I'm going to sleep
Well
WHERE ARE THE SHEETS
Whats the matter Retsamoreh? you want more hugs?
DERMATHIL CODES ARE AMAYZAN
9don't get me wrong, kiddo
!Flip
/me flies up in the air and does a backflip
/me lands safely on her hooves
9the games that the Wii DOES have, I love
/me hugs harder
9but on the long run
It's 2 bits a hug
/me runs from drf before he says "EW"
9the Wii is terrible.
/me flies up and hides in a tree
/me droops head, feels a little depressed
Youuu cant hide in there forever darling~
9and most of the Wii's good games are first-party stuff
It just doesn't have enough games, is the ONLY non-HD console out there.
DERMATHIL - FD WITH RAIN, BATTLEFIELD WITH POKEMON IN LAKE, HAUNTED MANSION SMASHVILLE, CUSTOM COLOURS, CUSTOM. FLIPPIN'. music.
eh... I guess I'll head off to bed now...
/me yawns
9third-party support is faltering like you have no idea.
Now, which Locke are you? The philosopher or the cripple?
9and third-party support basically DEFINES a console.
>dat heartbeat sensor
Welp, I got to sleep, touring some colleges tomorrow.
Or the Demon?
Third party support is effectively dead.
12o-o
newdcd - this is y i have high hopes for wii U
12virus!
Uh neither. I named him after the character in FF6
/me feels better now ^^;;
(mad)
/me looks up the tree
There ya go
:3
shoot, ah'm tired
g'night all
And has been for most of its life cycle because nobody gave a shit about trying to make something decent.
9I'm not placing any hopes on any consoles till they deliver. That's my philosophy from now on.
no brony bumping thread
MACROSS
9I bet on the Wii, and it idssapointed me
GO
Retsamoreh just come down, I promise i wont hug you TOO hard
Not that I ever actually played that game. I'm working on it.
yeah.
9well Dashite, you just said the problem with the Wii.
i like having high hopes, but i never buy consoles straight away
9yes, it has SOME games, but far too few.
I guess I'll wait 'til I see the Xbox next console and the PS4.
9Ergo, from a core gamer's point of view, it was not too good of a purchase.
but but newdcd - softmod = nes snes n64 gamecube wii
03http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pokmon-should-have-used-a-super-rod.gif
I'm jumping off the Nintendo console.
handhelds up to gameboy
I'm not going to buy the next gen of consoles.
and other old consoles
/me slaps on pony-cleats
and now we are less awesome
Dont make me come up there~
9which my computer can also play
when story?
o lol Kittan
Not after Sony told me that I don't own my PS3.
newdcd true dat
gamecube thou?
http://i.imgur.com/gyjJI.png
9and my computer's monitor is also my TV screen
9so yeah
KITTAN KILLU
9Dman: Dolphin.
/me dumps a few pinecones on ^BonBon's head in defiance
If it is your only game, I can agree with that.
There we go. Fixed my chat issues.
I have about 5 disks with maybe 20 games
game machine*
newdcd : my pc can't le dolphin ;__;
I'll take that as a yes
So who wants a sloppy sketch or two?
oh, not much. You draw that>?
nuthin much twilight
Hello.
/me stabs hooves into tree, slowly climbing to Retsamoreh
Hey, i wouldn't mind some art
also, i am loving latest brawl shiz: use savefile, record gameplay on pc dolphin
I'll draw you some art.
Cleats totally work that way
dolphin can upscale
I can't draw, but.
:D
That won't stop me.
I should draw some ponies too
9but yeah, Dashite, most of the game community agree that the Wii was a huge dissapointment.
I'll do anything non-explicit, as long as you don't mind my tiredness and whatnot.
9And these are Wii owners
I mean, I can, but both my handwriting and artistic skills are that of a six year old.
/me floats out of the tree and on top of the nearest building
9not the typical PS3HASNOGAEMS guys
I draw, but my cousin has my sketch book
THERES A MESSED UP CONCEPT. NINTENDO, A BUNCHAFANS MAKE A PROGRAM FOR FREE THAT UPSCALES WII GAMES. Y U NO WII U UPSCALE WII GAMES? EH? EH? riddle me that, gentlemen.
I gotta get some practice, and I wanna make people happy in the process.
TapeDiggety.
Yessir.
I'm sure, Pizzicato, that whatever you create is lovely
9if you aren't, that's nice for you, but really, it doesn't change the facts.
Draw Rets on Twilight's back.
I would link to my DA if no one minds
...
my mom likes it, Ridley.
i agree to all the facts and enjoy every console :3
wait
And, gee, I dunno. How bout some Pinkie Pie or Gummy or something?
Is it bad that I don't know who Rets is?
9the worst part is
This is Rets
9that the best Wii games have gotten ported or will soon be XD
A rather moody and cynical box.
9aside from the first party ones, that is.
Ooh I can buy a print!
NewDCD - you have no idea how much my heart sank with goldeneye xboxps3 trailer
You're.... a box
9I never saw it
Yes, and they're talking ponies.
^^
Don't act so friggin surprised.
9is it basically the Wii GoldenEye in those consoles?
Basically.
Yeah
the only differences i saw were glass shattering is improved, and when you reload the background doesn't blur so as to allow the wii to process animation
Yes NewDCD
9cause the Wii GoldenEye is...decent, but pretty much Cawadoodie with Bond
*appears behind Retsamoreh* I think you're the type who enjoys hugs with lots of spikes *reveals her leather jacket lined with razor blades*
not even graphical update at all
/me doesn't know WHAT he is
ya it's cawadoodie bond, and SUPER SHORT grr
IT's published by Activision.
And fake Bond.
didn't buy
friend bought thou. silly him.
There's your reason.
But yes, Rets resting on the back of a rather disgruntled looking Twilight would be nice.
when moment in storyline?
Disgruntled Twilight. Band name?
after those kills
9I'm thinking of getting a capture card to stream Disaster: Day of Crisis though
tis 6 30 and i'll probs be woken up at like 8 9 10ish
Well here is my DA if anypony or box is interested
heya tom is bob, from the office down the hall.
when the Getten monsters are dead
Okay, got it. Box on Twilight, then Pinkie/Gummy. I'll do my best.
it's good t see you buddy how've you been
9Disaster and the NMH series are pretty much the reason to own a Wii
and the gunmen
newdcd - sounds like a plan
Have fun!
things have been okay for mee except that i'm a zombie now
You mean other than first party.
Except that you're a zombie now?
oh haven't played NMH yet
yay!
i'd really wish you let us in.
First party is always the reason to own a nintendo console.
Thank you TapeDiggety!
's on mah list
I think I speak for all of us
When I say I understand
Diggity*
9never could enjoy Mario. But yeah, that's tacit and not necessary to mention.
Why you folks might hesitate
Don't thank me yet. Doin' it's always the hard part.

I'm writing a story that's a loos cross over with Valkryia Chronichles.
but ME, i hit my thumbs when with left stick i go right, while also, with right stick going left.
I would write it
but I have no talent
It's not really a cross over but it has enough for me to at least call it a loose cross over.
If I leave my thumbs on top of the sticks they collide.

Valkryia Chronicles was totally a PS2 game wasn'tit?
These attacks are so absurd, it's disappointing when the mechs aren't destroyed instantly.
skrEEEEEEEEEEEE
I love this game

I love how the mothership runs
It's a PS3 game.
"hey! i'm not copying anyone"

Valkary chronichles was PS3. I know very similar names.
And then just smacks him with its hull-sword
I mean PS2

TapeDiggity, that pun was so bad.... that I can't find my punishment stick.
Wait
However I'm not trying to be grim or dark about it nor am I trying to be real sad.

If you played Valkryia chronichles they manage to do a war story with out ever being that dark about it.
sorry nah
Wait... that means some of them are good.
Yeah, I think I've had that comin' for a while. I ain't surprised.
oh not now newdcd

http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/34321
I mean we dont talk for weeks unless i say anything
and my cat woke up
So i told her i was going to remove her from my friends list and she said she would start talking to me again
Equestria, not Earth...
I think that's a pretty common occurrence for Internet correspondents, Pyroh.
GO KING KITTAN!!! GO GET THE KILL
rhen talk to her instead
Should i let her try to start talking to me
Or just leave
People just wanna have some privacy sometimes.
FINISHING MOVE
No
MOOOOOOOOON BANISHMEEEEEEENT
Its been 2 motnhs
months*
And we have talked a max of maybe 30 times
Been about two or three years for me.
BANISHMENT!!! PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWNCHU
Well, if you're really friends with them you'll talk.
That's Celestia's finisher, not Luna's.
-__
iv tried that
i want to see a mecha do afalcon punch
I usually add people only if I know I talk to them
lol rodman
The second i dont have anythign to say
The conversation is over
Don't worry; true friends stick together through good times and bad.
Keeps the friends list true
9Rodman, you haven't seen it
-_-
UHUHUHAHAHAHAHA dat laugh wtf
Ill talk to her tomarrow........then decide
9but Aquarion's Mugen Punch does Moon Banishments

Ok Cupcake Man

lol, 10
Lets take a look
Anyways

Its nice to know I didn't help you with your problems
Im done boring you with my problemes
Continue talking
Well I have a housepets fanfic to work on

YES!
omagad i just saw apollo justice with darker hair
MOON BANISHMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And Paul please dont call me Cupcake man
9LOL DMAN
That fanfic sickens me
teeheehee
9I ALSO THOUGHT THE SAME OF THE DAI-GUARD PILOT
FINISH HIM
Pyroh, dear, perhaps your friend is having trouble finding something to talk about, but you wont really know unless you get it right from her. Try asking why she doesn't start the conversations. You're not likely to solve this problem by guessing all by yourself.
:P
Well
....
NO! NOT YET!
we do kind of struggle when talking
GIGA DRILL FINISHER
Try finding some common ground with her
I know the feeling. You two simply dont know eachother well enough to talk fluently
Like lunasta said, find some common ground
Pyroh, do you ever see each other in person?
Sadly their probablt won't be any battlefeild action till chapter four
Haha
9DRAMATIC VICTORY
No
GIGA DRILL!!!! BREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAKKU!!!!!!!!!!!!
friendships are mostly based on shared experiences
Im in Canada
Will it fit you? :P
YWA
nani?!
I love the GIGA DRILLU BREEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKU!!!!!!!!!!
03LOL"
YEA *
anyway I' just gonna take that to the fanfic chat
03I could get one in my size
03anyway
03HML
suddnely, music
so gl talking to someone you never see, it probably won't work after you run out of topics
03I swear God is trolling me
Yeah?
How
Dat sad music
9TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: RYOMA IS YELLING "KAMINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
But its been 2 months
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
9"A-ANIKI!"
I would of thought we would be talking by then...
Well dammit
Later, bro...
9TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: ABAYO, DACHIKO MEANS "FAREWELL, MY FRIENDS."
Pyroh have you tried doing some activities with her?
....
We cant
Perhaps an online game or other activity you can have fun doing?
No, the amount of talking you can get peaks shortly after meeting on the internet (or whatever), but decays over time
Were on the computer
And everybody in the team is fricking troubled by that.
Oh
uhhhh
AND NOW, WE ARE FKING OFF
9and now
9EVERYONE IS DEPRESS
I dont think she likes shoot em up's
;__;
TO SOME WELL-DESERVED REST, after the depress scene.
TF2's off the list then
See what she does like then. Find some way to do something with her
lol

Internet friendships can work well but real life friendships are much easier to pull off.
I need a word for a pony whore
What are you guys talking about?
Oh uhhh
...Kinda
I have my Girlfriend
What in good Celestia and Luna's name are you writing Mongoose?
And her friends
And a few classmates that seem to like me
But....i dont really have a friend of my own
A Crossover of Condemned Criminal Orgins and MLP
...waiting for vid to finish rendering
9and that's it for tonight
Well Pyroh I would suggest trying to spend some time with those classmates who seem to like you
WAIT
thanks for straming!
streaming! 9
Iv tried
1 THING
*
ack
They have friends of there own
How about...
How'd it go?
What the heck just happened?
what's up Polarfire?
Im just the Entertainment for the
a roundabout mare Mongoose
The Class clown
They just hang around me for a laugh
Plarfire what happen
Pyroh It's not going to do you any good thinking of yourself like that
DCD will you turn on your mic and talk to us in your sexy voice
o lol
So you're the loner that everyone talks to?
Sounds like me
Well, Sadly its true
:3
Talking like /that/ won't help either :P
pweese
Try to find other people then, people who dont already have an impression of you
vid almost done and i'm letired, leaving soon
I am outta here...
To late
Everyone knows and talks to me, but I really don't have anyone to confide in or trust
Iv already made my impression -_-
Like that Pyroh?
03Good.
THIS IS FOR MY BRONIES AINT NO-yea love this song
No
Pyroh, stuff doesn't take too long to change.
They dont really talk to me that much
vid done
People havnt liked me sense grade primary
Goodnight y'all
So, im use to this
...
wow he left in a hurry.
03LOL I love how this company says they got my rebate on a Sunday
haha yeah it's 7am there
03>No mail on Sunday
03THey're obviously slow
That's true XD
he was zombie-chatting for a while
Is this a bad time?
Pyroh if you REALLY beleive you're doomed, then try not to put too much value into freindship. It's not the end of the world
But i just want SOMEONE to be my friend
I mean yes i have my GF
Ok
But it isnt the same
my stream was fucked up for a minute
Oh? it isnt?
No
all better
I jsut want someone who actually likes me that i can invite over and hang aroudn without feeling akward
do you switch schools in the near future?
or are you returning to school soon? or am I wrong in assuming that people on are from the US at this hour >___>
Whoops, client crashed while I was AFK
...though I need to sleep soon
Your girlfriend doesn't like you?
See you guys less sparsely this coming week than weeks previous, in morning/late night only if at all
Oh no she does
But gf's and friends arent the same thing
You dotn kiss your friend
But, i shouldnt give you guys all of my problemes to deal with
Yeah, but, I mean, I've always like, enjoyed hanging out with the chicks I've been with, like, more so than I liked hanging out with anyone else.
So, y'know.
OH now you tell me.
So lets talk about something else shall we?
I'd be like hey man, let's go throw rocks at kids at the park and pretend it wasn't us, and then we'd go do that.
Hey DCD
streamception?
I'm not good at this stuff...
I'm not saying you should throw rocks at kids, but, I dunno, a movie?
I cant even get near people without SOMEONE making fun of me
For what reason?
will you read me a story?
Well sometimes you need to have a little fun made of you
Numerous reasons
To many to count
Like you're grammar?
Do people make of you for that.
...
I dont have bad grammar!
lol Pizzicato... look who's talking
Do i?
too* don't*
I*
"Like you're grammar"
...
"Like you are grammar"
Anyways
If you feel uncomfortable then tell whoever is poking fun at you to stop or at least bring the blows up from the belt.
Yeah I was mocking you, you misused 'to'.
Enough of this, im sure you'd all like to hear something other than me ramble
Yeah I would.
Get pissed at them... It works
Thats terrible advice whompman
Naw, my net is being sucky right now so I can't play games
So I bough this awesome camera, and I really like it, and I ran a roll of film through it, took some really great pictures, pictures I was stoked to see.
I hear noises
Then I developed the roll.
http://i.imgur.com/79oAX.png
Light leaks, man.
I regret nothing.
God damned light leaks.
1. thats what they want and 2. It will only get you a bad reputation
Oh wow
Stupid chat -_-
Keeps lagging
Like, half of my pictures are RUINED.
Alright I'm guessing I'm not good with this stuff
It dont matter
The two best shots survived, so I'm happy about that.
Im done anyways
My chair
it moved
Go to the store and go Cave Johnson on them :P
Not that i got all the out
alone
._.
Hah
it's 1:30
Im ready to be Good ol Pyroh again :3
TapeDiggity
You're awesome
It is. It's like 0130 on the dot.
Well Pyroh.. just dont give up is all I can say. and you're doing alot of that right now
Do you do any other works? Have a dA?
BonBon
I agve up 2 years ago
gave*
Yeah, I've got a dA, but I'm really bad at keeping it updated.
Its a bit late for that :3
Why does everyone ask do you have DA? Why can't you have a website? A portolio, a wordpress?
Don't worry Pyroh. This community is based on love and tolerance after all.
I do appreciate the support, though; means a lot to me.
LOVE AND TOLERANCE, BRAH
Yeah, if nothing we'll still love you Pyroh ;)
You should work your way over to #EquestrianStudy, we love artists over there.

Hah, I have a screwed up sleep sched Pizzicato
Oh, me too.
I know how!
I'm in bed between one and five, and up between ten and one.
I don't know why I bother keeping it but it helps me with my productivity
I go to bed at 4ish

but I have a job that doesn't really cater to sleep schedules, so it's all good.
That's not screwy

Man, that's a pretty good palette.
Like, I have potatoes.
I can make mashed potatoes.
A baked potato
A latke
Hash browns
Yeah, apparently someone actually stocked the fridge this week
It was actually not bad.
Potato crisps.

not really what I expected based on the trailers
Why are you listing foods
Is it your grocery list :3
No, those are things I can make
SPOILER: humans lose
'cause I have potatoes.
Awwww
Ok
Nope, it's what's in my fridge
And potatoes are awesome.
/me has nothing but bread, peanut butter, and LOTS OF JELLY

Anyways
BitZero: they're trying to ponify the Solar System
give me food
now
Norberts in a happy place now
Eating aliens
I got an Idea on how to save us!
Are you guys doing a scale of 1:1 or something?
We take Earth.
DannySwish might like this conversation
:(
And We PUSH it somewhere else!
I miss him
What else, Lunasta?
I'll wait a few thousand years to see the results.
Good.
Paul
You've got some patience, BitZero
Norberts already gone
Or we build an exact copy of Earth right over there!
If luna can wait that long
we all can
We have one minute people!
I've got billions of years worth of time, MrPoniator. It's only a small blip.
12oh
Guess that works
12noooo
So you're just stopping by to say hello?
12:D
12why are you so happy
Hes already gone paul....
ragequit
Perhaps.
MK9, huh?
yep
MK9?
12just because you have me on a leash doesn't mean you own me
Mortal Kombat 9
Mortal Kombat
12True, but now you can't just run away XD
Oh how I love terrorizing my little dino food
…dino food??
O_o
Screw the Earth, I'm a brony!
o_O
Damn you johnny cage
…lolwut?
Dino nuggets Blacklight
why does your xray combo have to be a parry?
What is this "Earth" you speak of, brony?
12Wb
Because parries are cool
…dino niggets???
O_o
o_O
O_o
o_O
dino shaped chicken nuggets
(totally plays characters with guard points in fighting games)
/me tosses some over
Parries are cool
but bots are a pain in the ass to do parries on
12hi drf
Bang's one frame guard points, here I gooo!
It works well online
12wbs Danny :|
just not offline
Yeah, bots are a bit harder to practise parrying with
Unless you can just record the actions, dunno how MK9 training mode works
I never use training
Ah, ok
I just fight in till I get better
I'm either in training mode or playing versus against a buddy in offline, so yeah
I played versus all day
but I play plenty of online matches
ok
I kick flank with Johnny Cage
12this puzzle is muy dificil
Welp, I didn't get into MK9 anyway, so ah well
I'll just stick to mah BlazBlue
And try to get better in Guilty Gear while I'm at it
i'm still playing kof2k2 and sfz3
MK is the only fighting game I play
I tried MVC3
but went back to MK
Well, Alpha 3 is cool and so is kof2003
Looking forward to KoFXIII
/me puzzles it up
Cage has some amazing combos
03GRR
I'd kill if I could do some high level combos that you never get to use in real matches
In BB, that is
I have never played BB
Bronies! How goes it?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIdMA8tVYlY&feature=related Totally would kill if I knew this combo
Just likelyhood of actually using that... -5%
I'm not really into fighting games like that
I like the speed and style of MK
Yeah, BB/GG are a bit more floaty and speedy when compared to MK9
yeah
need to get my coworkers play umk3 on mame again...
12wb drf?
hello..
great thankies and you?
12How are things Umbreon?
12i am sort of alive
12how is new mexico?
12nice and cold?

12i thought night time it gets cold
!weather 88001
!weather 54650
12odd
I love Cage's second fatality
12Na, we won't start getting cool nights until later this summer
12when it's almost fall XD
That reminds me that I gotta practise mah Ragna combos and Carl setups for next weekend
Since there's some BlazBlue meetup in Sweden I'm gonna attend
12They are already cooling down though
12We need to battle in PO some time
12i don't know how to battle
So I got a new cool computer
Specs?
12It's pretty easy actually.
12somewhat similar to the TCG
12are you talking about Pokemon Online?
12Yep
12i know the video game
12i just don't know how to competitively do it
12lol
12i actually find it easier to be a competitive player when you can see all the cards on the table
12in battles you have no idea what your opponent has until they bring it out
12I'm not that great at PO, so we would be even XD
Well i think its time to hit the sack
G'night everypony

I don't know the numbers by heart
12i tried being good
12i just can't do it
12and building a pokemon team drives me nuts and gives me a headache

12i can usually build a competitive pokemon tcg deck
12in like 5 minutes
12Same here, but I just keep trying xD
12Like
12I've only won 2 times before on there XD
I know the name of it! It's Boast Busters.
Episode six.

That's it, thanks
12and the people I beat where new to it LOL

I finally start paying attention to the channel, and it's dead. :<
Do you play MK9 with a pad or stick btw, Mongoose?
MrPoniator Athlon II x4 645, 1tb hard drive, 9gb ram, GeForce GTX 560Ti
Oh well. Night everypony.
9GB RAM?
Sounds tasty
You heard me
That's a weird amount of RAM.
I have 7GB and 128MB.
Graphics card is able to run Crysis 2. Full Specs.
Suck on that shit.
I'm stuck with 4GB
/me sighs at ponibooru.
But yeah, that's quite a powerhouse there
4GB here too
I cap out at 8 which suuuuuuuuuuucks 'cause I use digital audio workstations a lot.
Mhm
It's not that bad for just gaming
Yeah, Ponibooru was good for like, two days.
Now it's back to fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
12perhaps
Yeah, I can kinda figure that with those specs it's not entirely just for gaming
Yeah, my rigs set up for mainly gaming
My dad checked, should be able to run EVERY modern game
My buddy bought a gaming setup, but doesn't play any PC games, heh
12XD
12hi drf
12but yeah
Since he's heavy on video editing and composing music
12i remember not being satisfied with shoddybattle
Only problem is that graphics card didnt come with enough power cables :/ So Im stuck with the "Meh" built-in card for now
12but yeah, you can feel free fre to battle me xD
Ah
12I'm quite bad at it :D
12because it felt like it was lacking and i'd often lose track of things so i looked into new programs
12and found PO
Friendship
Friendship Everywhere
12i guarentee if we did challenge cup
friend of mine built a very powerful pc and the only game he plays is minecraft and very old RTS games
12you'd beat me everytime XD
12my luck is just that bad
12XD
Oh boy
night night
Old PC games that didn't have framerate limiters or so
/me has a 1200$ laptop, plays minecraft ... but, she writes music on it also, so theres that.
12-fre
I remember playing Commandos earlier this year, and it ran about seven times of the supposed speed
MrPoniator: Same here, d00d. I can max out a lot of games, but I built this thing from the ground up for Pro Tools.
Yeah, I getcha
and explode again
I get it!
/me wishes her laptop came with an asio capable soundcard, but at least she has a usb version.
Octavia...
/me explodes
yes, sir?
/me gives Octavia roses
/me blushes softly, "For me?"
I run a Tascam US-2000 as my primary recording interface, I know, you'll go GUH FAW, but it sounds pretty damn good for the price.
/me crawls out from ashes
let me get you a recording I did.
Stop...saying...explode...
For you.
Octavia: Here you go http://doctormowinckel.com/boogers/songs/back_to_your_momma.mp3
/me smiles coyly
I mean
hm
This processor is quad-core and is pulling 3.1GhZ
I know how expensive the film editing stuff can be, so ah well
12Hey there NS
So there's something to be said about that lol
momento, slow internet at my home.
Oh, yeah, you can drop a shitload of money on recording gear.
Roses are red, violets are blue, you write beautiful music, and that's why i love you.
/me goes to Hollywood
I'd like to have about four Neumann U87's, they run 3.2k a pop.
my new compressor was ridiculous :(
12hi
"Hey, can I touch that Camera?"
/me breaks it
…wow!
I can't believe nopony grabbed these nicks!
Whoops, thousands of dollars wasted!
LOL
Pizzicato, very good song!
Thanks.
o-o
Nicks?
Good band.
lol hi
Nicks.
Like, anyone can put a mic in front of those guys and make them sound good.
Nicks everywhere
Altair fuck you
That was recorded in a rehearsal studio.
12Yep
If you're an audio geek I can give you the full rundown of the mikes I used.
spidersean3 Overclock it!
:U
The graphics clock has been pre-Overclocked
howdy, say any pony here have microphone experience to when it comes to recording?
I meant the CPU
i find a lot of music that i enjoy in the indie area sound far better when they work off piece and parts equipment
/me remembers when he felt like he was the shit when he overclocked his old Win95 computer
Piece and parts equipment?
garage equipment :)
I have it easy lol
You make that sound in the mix.
I can't hold it anymore
/me glomps Octavia
/me eeps!
Record them well, then you can make them sound like trash in the mix, or you can make them sound like they were recorded with shite.
Sudden outbursts @ #EquestriaDaily
Oh Black Editions, so cheap and so fun
I enjoy the fact that just about every brony knows their way around a computer
hi
12wbs
I'm listening to this track again, and yep, I freakin' nailed the mix. I am not even going to be modest, this sounds good, damn good.
12!Pokemon
^ [MrPoniator's message]
You gotta know in this era
12Yay
Well im using a desktop microphone by the iessentials brand,its not that bad but pretty light and not use an usb port. so i have to use recorder to get it connected to audacity and other uses. Im new to recordning myself and not sure what a good what level the microphone should be
The Wall is a Spy!
If we didn't, it'd be all Skynet in here
That's such a cocky thing to say, but this sounds good. Good band, good engineer.
Derpynet, more likely
/me Stares suspiciously at wall
Tenaris: I record at -18.
Not that I hate bots or anything
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
yes
it does sound great
Thank you!!
/me glomps Lunasta
Don't feed the Derpynet!
That gives me headroom to mix, and I push my mix to -6, then push the master to -.1.
o..o
I wanna see if my 555 can unlock into a quad core
Don't record at 0, then you won't be able to mix without peaking.
Pizzicato: Microphone or microphone boost?
03respond to my PM alreadyu
03-u
*looks around, sees no one*
Huh? What's your preamp?
but my mobo was $37 on sale and it doesn't do unlockings
*pulls out banjo and begins to play*
i use windows viesta
1FLIP
Whoops
!flip
/me flips a muffin
/me catches the muffin with her hoof, correct side up

Lunasta, I'm sure if most of us didn't know computer specs, skynet would eat us all
i'm expecting my brother to give me his laptop that's 20% better than mine
Pizzicato: thanks
Thanks, Derpy.
20% cooler, also?
Also...
Octavia: I'm a bassist, stand up bass.
Ya all with your...your...electronic instruments.
Meh
it's kinda plaid.
oh, i play viola also, darling
Ooh PMVs
I've been wanting to pick up violin.
mine at least has a cool Q on the middle
I've written a bunch of songs for jazz violin, and I can record bass, use Ivory for keys, but I can't get any good violin recordings by myself.
*dances to the music*
/me punts then shoots his internet
VERIZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
12!pokemon
12uh oh
i would prefer my old yamaha ivory baby grand but i lack space for one
I need to pick up piano, too. I'm looking to take orchestration classes, and in some of the classes, you're given a sheet of music to be played by a full orchestra, and are told to arrange it for piano.
Like, on the spot.
Does make a bonesaw sound like a violin counts as instrument?
Octavia: What was it?
/me grabs a bonesaw from his bag
I've recorded a C7.
Which was really awesome.
/me holds it like a violin and somehow starts playing The Godfather theme
I prefer Bösendorfers, but when you're presented with a C7, you're not going to complain.
poor stripes
everyone leaves before you can talk to them
I really need to pick up piano, like, it's a necessity.
i had a g2 that was partially burned in a house fire. i restored and restrung it completely
i have a friend which repairs instruments, she helped me
I want to record orchestras, and if you're recording orchestras, you need to be able to read music better than you can your native language.
haha
...*sniff armpits*....mmmmmm, im not mTHAT bad :)
I'm going back to school for theory.
I'm pretty serious about recording orchestras.
12Pidgeotto <3
That's what I'm going to do, and that's pretty much it.
you make me want to listen to pizzicato 5
Oh yeah, my name.
I play pizz.
So, you know.
12don't leash me D:
I can't play arco very well.
That sounds like a lot work you put into your piano, sucks to lose it.
ok
I've put a lot of work into an instrument before, it's so satisfying, and people got to see mine.
I'm not sure you got to roll around your piano to venues.
ha.
/me continues to lurk
so as a few are heading to sleep, im guessing that there are mostlu u.s. ponies here?

i used to play in venoit park in tampa
I had an Engelhard EC1, I sanded it, primed it, painted it white, lacquered, and put a pretty boss pick up in it.
12Floof~
Thing was shiny as all get up.
yeah.
probably most are I would guess.
nise well i is downunder :)
*nice
What genres or styles of music do you play?
What time is it there?
510pm
12oh no, look what NS started at the c-box XD
2 am here
03*s-box
12drf-box*
ahh, thats why there isnt much happening
03no
eeyup.
strangely enough, since i am in the land of completely void culture, ive been playing a lot of country songs. not the twang kind.
12NO U ---->
Does hay make you itchy?
its about 8 am for the europeans.
03why the arrow
On violin or piano?
so pretty much a dead hour for everyone but the aussies :P
12Because you
/me runs
piano, i am a very big rascal flats fan
Know the name, not the band.
12How are things drf?
03fine
for practice, i play quite a bit of aplocalytica-type on the viola
Violas are weird, I'm very used to violin, for some reason I know like, six? violinists, I see them a lot, I played with in a piano trio a lot, too.
So when I see a viola, I'm like wtf did that violin eat a bunch of ice cream or something?
/me giggles
12Yay :D
i love its depth, the notes seem to resonate nicely in my ears
1291.121.255.156:5080
so is there many ausies here
Yeah, I always think that violists and violinists hear something really different than what the listener is hearing.
how horrifyinng
That seems mean Pizzi
Calling a viola fat
EEEEeeeenope.
it is fat
They are! Look at them!
/me smiles
They look weird.
They're weird!
I like 'em, for sure, but they're like, the odd man out in the string family.
I think they prefer crafted larger :P
viola is the violins fat friend you take to a club to look better by comparison
Haha.
some pop in from time to time but there's not that many from what I've seen.
hehe, oh, well, im happy to help fix that :P
lol
strangely enough, my brother in law is a violist also
That is kind of strange.
/me rubs her eyes, yawning.
/me is bored
Go jump of a cloud Blacklight
that should cure your boredom
im currently helping my partner in reading sheet music and playing banjo, trying to get him through the agonizing cat whining phase.
fine, I will!
Haha.
Some people play without knowing theory!
That seems so weird to me.
/me jumps off of the cloud he was lying on
thats very true
/me falls
I can't fathom not knowing theory.
wheeeeeeeeeeeeee!
my step father was very by-ear guitar player
/me pulls out of the dive at the last second
/me alights on another cloud
There are a lot of talented dudes out there who don't know theory, for sure, but they're the exception.
/me applauds for BlacklightShining
hey guys!
/me beams
thank you, thank you, I'm here all night
so, how long has this channel been here
Man, I see a lot of musicians, and I'd say only about a third of people in rock know how to read sheet music.
it's 3:32 am here, and im still not asleep yet!
Yeah, same here.
IMPOSSIBLE
Only I'm 14 minutes in the past.
/me is just a simple girl, does not play for flash. she has a great day just sitting on her patio and playing for the birds.
it's 0:19 here!
say that to the guy who drank 7 cup of tea
so it must be either 3:19 or 2:19
so it must be either 3:19 or 4:19 *
I'm a bassist, bassist don't ...we just, we don't, y'know, man we're in our own world.
well the movie nights started around mid may, and the chat has been here since then.
youre a musician?
I have a blank stare when I'm playing bass, just staring at a spot on stage, I find a plank of the flooring, and stare at it.
Yeah I play stand up bass.
wow, nice,
We've been talking about music for like the past half hour.
Ohh neat!
They've switched hosts a couple times also.
I like music as well, just that I dont play any instrument
i have had a couple times where i have hijacked an empty piano at a mall or hotel and just played till either the manager kicks me out or i made enoguh tips to drink the rest of the night :)
exept for triangles
But this particular room has been here since I've been here, about the first week of june.
Haha, man! Have you been to a piano bar?
Two pianos across from each other, people go on stage and have piano battles.
Off to game I shall, so be a dear and be a pal!
yeah, used to go to one in tampa bay
oh this sort of piano bar?
Those are so cool!
#bronystate, I mean
I went to one in Detroit, I wish my pianist had been there.
great, so its almost as new as i am to mlp ..hehe
its remind me of the movie Who framed roger rabbit where donald and daffy are having a piano battle
my favorite was venoit park. almost every night there was a quartet or a choir or something there. then they would do shakespear on the grass
She's really good, what's that competition for amateur pianists called?
ah.
/me sighs deeply, missing her home.
The big one, I can't remember the name of it, but it's for 35 and older amateur pianists.
g2g
Bye
She's going to be entering that competition in the future.
and Octavia... I LOVE YOU, there i said it
35 and older? one more year for me.
/me groans thinking about that.
well I think I'm going to go.
Ha.
35, old?
nice meeting you stripes
I'm afraid not.
im 34
i has only discovered this new series about end june/early july and have fallen in love with it
That's not old.
um..ok Polarfire
i feel it sometimes
Old is 60+, and that's only if you're not taking care of yourself.
nice chatting with you too..
especially in here. haha
[off-topic] are there any non-malicious uses of ping -f ?
goodnight sweat pony dreams!
ping f?
-f does what?
-f - do not frag packets
oh, fragment flag?
-f Flood ping. Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one
hundred times per second, whichever is more. For every
ECHO_REQUEST sent a period ``.'' is printed, while for every
ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed. This provides a
rapid display of how many packets are being dropped. Only the
super-user may use this option. This can be very hard on a net-
work and should be used with caution.
oh, not what i thought.
I've been writing a fic that's very music related, it involves Octavia, and a jazz piano trio, so I can write for that sort of thing really easily.
yep sounds like a lot of others.
I posted the intro; http://www.forums.rainbowdash.com/index.php?topic=140.0
I think you need to be a musician to know what I'm on about.
seems to me the only use for it is DDoS'ing a site
shush ponies are sleeping
In the fic, that is.
ill read it definitely
oh you
great..i is not alone :)
run that from a bunch of different computers…
:D
so have you been to a movie night yet stripes?
as always, you can use certain techniques and programs for testing a network
You'd probably be able to guess why I named the violinist Four Fifths, too.
i have icmp off
um..no..i need an explination of that ..hehe
iirc
hello ClockworkPie
it provides an non-malicious use in it's won description :p
if you've got a dodgy network and you want something to flood the network with to see what's happening, flood ping is simple and effective
aw hello stripes
HOWS YOU?
quite good actually, you?
ooops..sorry about the capsloc
not bad thankies
so ya never been to one of the movie nights yet O.o
um, no i hasnt..tell me all about it?
/me nods off again
i think i have had enough

work killed me today
ok, where does it take place
What do you do for money?
Pizzicato, nice to meet you. hope to see you when i am less asleep

2. even within chrono cross, the decision to make schala blonde was annoying as hell. she had blatantly blue hair in the sprites of CT

What?
Chrono Cross was horrible?
That's a silly thing to say.

I'm about to go to dinner, Umbreon, so make it quick please :p
12what is the PO server for ho-oh realms
connection being silly, chrono cross wasnt terrible, it just is considered to be a parraell universe
just as the dreamers
It's down
we never brought it back up
12oh
how is you?
And Altair and I are too lazy to update

i hope to drop in again yes..
herro people
Chrono Cross would have been so much better if it were unconnected to Chrono Trigger. Hell, Chrono Trigger would have been better with a proper, direct, sequel.
well if you are ever bored and need someone to talk to, ill probably be here lurking
night stripes
ill remember that :)

technicly
its considered a parraell universe to trigger like radical dreamers
possible
y
buuut, that doesn't mean it was an optimal game
so it pretty much not really a sequeal but is one
chrono trigger 2 is still in the waits, seriously one day square will stop focusing on fantasy and give it a thought
/me noms
12sorry i'm a bad cook
12:<
Not as bad as I am
I can cook Hot Pockets well, but not much else :|
But honestly at first i hated trigger and got on the bash wagon the same way i did with dreamers, and after playing it im okay with it. good characters music and story. Just still want that next gen trigger remake xD;
Hiya
12:/
12did you ever even try anything else?
I hope we get another proper Castlevania, after that fiasco that was Lords of Shadow
Mom taught me how to bake Ghirrardelli (or however the heck you spell it) brownies 2 summers ago
Do you want a Castlevania, or Metroidvania?
uhhh
either, really, just not God of War
I can sorta make this awesome Velveeta cheese dip
but my mom is much better at it
hell, Castlevania 64 was better than lords of shadow
I'd prefer a normal one, seeing I don't like the metroidvania aspect in SotN, DoS, etc
12hmm
12i am always afraid to cook meat
(and was a much better game than people give it credit for)
Metroids are fine, but in games like SotN the exploration feels quite bland
It's not the easiest thing to cook exactly to your taste
rare, medium rare, medium well, well, there are so many ways to have it cooked
hello barry
Just gimme a game like Rondo of Blood and we're talking
How are you?
great and you?
DIE MONSTER! YOU DON'T BELONG IN THIS WORLD!

Say, what time is it where you live, Stripes?

LOOK WHAT YOU DID, abirkin2!
It's 4:16 PM here
AM*
It's like begging a perhaps needless chapter to already finished story
sorry about that
BEWARE MY SORCEROUS POWERS!
hehe, you is up early or very late to hit the hay
up early
I hit the hay at 9 PM
But yeah, if SE ever needs a quick buck
I'm the opposite. :)
Make a HD remake of FF7 and infinite easy money
which would be 11 AM for you, I'm guessing
Still pretty darn surprised that they're not doing just that
By the opposite, I mean that I'm up late as opposed to early.
hehe yupyup
hello dashite
Hi Dashite
Or you could have been talking to stripes. Damn you lack of body language context!
Hey.
FFVI was better
I was chatting to stripes, but that's nice to know, Dashite
hehe
I know, but FF7 still gets the title that really broke the ice between westerns and JRPGs
my fave was tactics
abirkin2: you're scaring everypony away…
:(
I like Tactics and FFIX

Maybe not
The Sonic The Hedgehog songs are quite catchy and good
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvux5Bdizao
I have never been a Sonic fan
RE Imo has the best music
Not much of a Sonic fan either
12 AM, to be technical
I am a massive Sonic fan
Resident Evil, Mongoose?
yep
I'm not a Sonic fan either, but the soundtrack is pretty good
Otherwise, dawn
which games and tracks?
Daisuke Ishiwatari, JDK Band and Motoi Sakuraba ftw
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH_MCPcjxP0
Mostly the first three
the save room themes are the best
MrPoniator just named two of my favourite composers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53aDI5K49F4
Hmm...
Fallout, Mass Effect, RE and MGS had the best music
you know we're finally getting ports of 4 to 360 and PS3 supposedly?
imo
I want to know the name of this song... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi54WXIoDas
when you wake up?

adobe crashed on me x-x';
Wake me up when summer ends :p

Ponibooru needs better hosting

too many ponies use it
whatever's hosting it now can't take all the requests
never
did you know, that the main compose for morrowind, oblivion, and presumably skyrim did the soundtrack to Secret of Evermore?
well yeah its probally at the level where it needs to uypgrade the memory space
MOAR BANDWIDTH
I don't think bandwidth is the problem :P
th worst case scenario is they wipe all the data clean
why in the world would they wipe the server?
Pony Overload!
would be better to just ftp it all over to a new server
once their paid time runs out at least
To a new server that doesn't screw up the OS
Mmm
well, slightly *before* their paid time runs out -.-
another cost money the mods wouldnt have
DONATIONS
MrPoniator: screw up the OS? what?
*cartoon lightbulb*
GOOGLE!
why didn't I think of it before?
Too obvious?
what? going to mirror ponibooru? lol
"According to our webhosts, the instability since July 27th was due to a "bumpy" operating system upgrade on the host servers. "
lol no
just google site:ponibooru.413chan.net and change it to images
Google caches everything, so…
heh
ah
I'm pretty sure Google doesn't use conventional servers any more; rather, they're using miniature black holes to store everything.
wonder what they did to mess up the OS, the hosting company that is
They heard deleting win32 (while it's probably not a Win OS) was a good idea
/me snickers
impossible!
no, it is a windows server
how do they retrieve the data?
Ah
is has port 135 open, which is the port for msrpc
Thought they'd use Linux or somethin'
ware wa messiah nari! hahahahaha!
it has*
abirkin2, too much Mega Man Zero 3?
and that port is almost never used on linux, although I guess it could be...

at 3:18 Am
Creation date: 24 Jan 2011 20:34:00
is when the domain equestriadaily.com was registered

Less than a year? Cool.

I thought FiM was more than a year old, though. Cool to know that, too.
first episode of FiM was 10/10/10
lol@that date
Easy to remember
this is true
Presumably Season 2 will be around the same date this year, then.
hopefully soon :D
What are yall expectaions for season 2? . .Aside from the Luna fanon being the canon xD;
ponies!
(i really don't have any -.-)
I don't think I have any, either. And I'd rather not have any, so they don't get dashed.
I just hope it is as good as S1, even if it is a little worse, that would still be good enough for me :D
I imagine there'll be more nods to the fanon from the background ponies.
But that can't be anything that the little girls could notice and not understand.
I just hope they don't overdo those
S1 had the right amount imo
Some of Derpy's fan shoutouts bother me for being too obvious.
Like when she paused in front of the camera when Dash & Fluttershy arrived for the Young Fliers, or her front-row seat at Fluttershy's fashion show.
you think they overdid the derpy eyes?
yeah, those were kind of in your face
Im hoping they start a seasonal trend, you guys remeber how dash at the gala psuhed that gray pony caesar into the air and catch him to imopresse the wonderbolt right?
No, just made her presence too obvious.
Yes....
Im hope they make it some sort of running gag where she does stuff like that to him
I want another winter episode too -.-
yknow like everytime he is around her he will get abus--hurt xD;
That'd be cool....
though with his lack of popularity i doubt it happening
however with fanon hur hur hur
I don't believe so...

06it's a notice msg
It'll flood the channel, and note there's something called "redundancy"
The !base one wasn't :p
"Let me show you, fraulein, what I am used to dealing with..."
Also, i suggest using if ($strip($1) == !base) { in your script as well
06and the effect is?
07Super effective!
06oh, and pattyrick is back on hids own PC now :P

do it in another channel

Bye Shaico.
akirbin2, don't forget Chun-Lis thighs
At this rate she'll be a Legzilla
Who could....
I main Balrog myself, and his head seems to get smaller with every update.
That too
Also I still like to think that Dee Jay got hit by a frying pan at birth, seeing how flat his head is in earlier games
It is a bit flat.
but, on the topic of ryu, I mean, he started out well built, but mostly human, with a decent face... I don't know who this SFIV guy is, but it isn't Ryu
I like the SFIV graphical style. Chunky and cartoony.
Yeah, Capcom went apehorseapples with the muscles in SFIV
Makes Mortal Kombat characters look like wimps.
Well, I'll rather take my (mostly skinny) anime characters in BB
Aaaaand there it is.
Hellew
Yoo
First thing I see is something about skinny anime characters out of context, EQ chat at 3 am...good times.
Heck, if a small kid like Carl can kill of Tager with unblockable resets, it's no laughing matter http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5m4mqtiHQ4
hehe
hi
Yo
Yoo
Heh
I don't play BB much but I know Tager has trouble in a number of matchups.
Hi Rainbrodash
HA! I loved that video because Carl and Tager are my two characters!
Haha
hello RainBroDash
And what's funny, Stripes?
And Tager really has trouble in all match-ups
As long as the character doesn't try to use frame traps
Tager cause I love the meaty tanks and Carl cause I love a challange and it's such an awesome concept for a fighting game.
the clip
I play Bang, recently picked Ragna and try to learn setups for Carl while at it
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Cognitive Dissonance (Upate Part 6!) (http://tinyurl.com/6etjcrm)
I don't play online or competatively but there are 4 people who play at my house, so we keep each other sharp.
Coolio
That's not a nightly roundup, Seth....
I don't really have a whole lot of people around my area to play with, so I go to fighting game meetups and all
Next weekend to Umeå
nightly wrapup, nightly wrapup! cause tomorrow day is here!
Nobody in the gaming club at school plays...damnedest thing.
Same here. I've been to a few Street Fighter tournaments but they generally whup me badly.
Wow, Ume... Thats almost close to me -.-
:U
And my XBLive connection, when I had one, was pretty laggy so I rarely played online.
The amount of time necessary to get good enough at any game to be competative at a tourney is far beyond the point of fun for me.
Can't agree more.
Well, it can still stay fun, depending on if the other players follow your skill level
I still had fun.
I was getting really good at MK9, then I found Deadly Premonition and remembered what fun was.
I knew I'd be beaten.
But yeah, fighting games are kinda niche seeing how much you need to put time into them to be good and all
I'm not saying it can't be fun for people to play that much and get that good, I just know it's not for me.
I still put plenty of hours into the offline modes so I knew the game, it was just PvP stuff I fell down on.
So I'm not surprised when people prefer it the casual way
Yeah, bots are rather random or more or less predictable
There are people who go out of their way to learn the finest points of every matchup, exact hitbox and damage stats... that's above my limit.
But with players you need to be more vary of your tactics
I don't look into framedata charts (while I do understand 'em)
Non-sequitor, anypony ever played an ole horror/adventure game called "I have no Mouth and I must scream"?
I did! awesome time
I've heard of it
wrong channel
but hi :)
/me is back
Every new update for SFIV gets pored over in minute detail, and while I can follow the arguments, I don't get upset by a single-frame startup speed change.
Heard the name, know nothing about it.
Or hey! Ibuki's U1 has one less frame start-up on reversal!
Cool, just downloaded, looks fun. SFIV was odd for me, I could beat it on Very Hard and win about half my matches online in about a week after no more than 10 hours of total play, but never got any better.
Exactly.
Yeah, SFIV was kinda the same kind of deal to me
Or Street Fighters in general
BlazBlue though compelled me to get better
There's just something so standardized and not-special about it.
Blazblue and MK9 were the only fighting games over the last 3 years that have really grabbed me.
Well, SF is one of those definining serieses
-in*
Hi
Hey-o
Hellew
Well, IV specifically, like they made the characters all not-special anymore. I didn't feel like I was playing a russian super man or a Bruce Lee clone, just different sprites with moves that were either slow and powerful or quick and light.
Also while I do understand the differences between different shoto characters, I prefer variety, even if it results in a smaller roster
Like BB, none of the characters are alike in multitude of ways
BB has a decent roster, especially since there's so much difference but still good balance, in CS anyway. CT was just laughably unbalanced, but just a good starting point.
Yeah, Carl's clap loop and Rachel were out of this world
Among other things
I want Mane6 to come out already.
CS2 balanced the things pretty nicely
But now there's CS2+, which supposedly changes the balance again
And Nu was too powerful and Arakune's curse was on or off, and good luck getting a shot it when it's on.
Yeah, that was quite something
er, what is CS2? it definitely is not what I think it is -.-
The one on PSP?
CS1 = BBCS ver. 1.00
1.01 adds Makoto
1.02 adds Valkenhayn
1.03 changes the game to use CS2 balancing, and adds Platinum the Trinity
And now, CS2+, which will be 1.04 I suppose, will add Relius Clover
Though, CS2+ is only confirmed for PS Vita from what I know
So may be a while before that patch hits consoles
For example with the balance changes, Bang is S-tier in CS1, but middle/low in CS2
So yeah, it changes quite a lot, from combos to tiers, etc
MK9 has been doing balancing and patches all the time since launch, but ArcSys just releases this kind of stuff in bigger patches
Hay Octavia
And I guess that's enough of me being nerdy about BB
Hey
I was following you, I just don't play BB so I couldn't add anything.
Yeah, I can figure
And well, supposedly there's a loketest coming up soon for CS2+, so I guess more details will surface then if it changes a whole lot
You seem to be having trouble tuning the cello there.
That's rather distressing
First time here
Ah. The Octavia name is registered to someone so it's not going to stick.
Fgiures, even though I was the first.
Damn posers.
Well, someone just beat you to it
Probably someone using it in a different name meaning
Its an actual name of cvourse.
The registered Octavia's a regular. She'll probably be in later, this is a bit early for her I think.
Welp, there was the guy/gal who registered Octavia here last night
Well, I'm (arguably for some) one of the people who came up with that name for her.
Well, in that case that quite stinks
Ah, the perils of creating something so popular.....
Mhmm.
I'm the "Octavia" in the comments on the blog too.
You've registered there?
Ooh I love your avatar.
Mhm.
lol Thanks.
Yeah, I just post as anonymous
I'm "Fall" in the blog but that was also registered here, so I had to make up a surname for myself.
I posted as "Derpy Hooves" for a while too.
well im off ive had fun meeting you all, goodnight everypony
Which reminds me, must change avatar....
Well, I doubt anyone will take this name anyway, so ah well
cya
But a friend I have who works on the show said I more resemble "Octavia" since I'm a musican and DJ irl, so they said I should stick with her. They know Derpy and Octy are my favs.
Heh, alrighty
Though personally I think I'm also quite derpy like Derpy irl. lol
You could add a flourish of some sort to your name. We've got like three Rainbow Dashes.
I have plenty of derp moments.
lol Yeah.
Theres so many combinations of popular names in one place at any given time.
One place I used to frequent had like 4-5 RD's and Pinkie's sometimes.

I could trot out my crackpot theory that the ponies are not, in fact, ponies, but are, in fact, cats.

But just look at them. They are definitely cats.

Teehee
47.3s of 1m40s done
Though, now comes the most painful part
Excuse my ignorance but what are you animating?
Ponified version of an opening
heya Xeli
But I'm too lazy as buck even though it's not that hard technically to do
06~
I see, opening to?
You'll see
Oh, didn't know it was a secret ;)
Yeah, for whatever reason I'll keep it that way till it's done
Well i hope things go well for the next minute of animating :)
I'll try to finish it before thursday, but gotta see
Since I'll be away between thursday-sunday, so yeah
Will be looking forwad to seeing it :D
forward*
Alrighty :p
My first proper animation since I quit animating in Flash three years back, so oh god how cranky it all feels
oh, no rush. if you think that's what i meant. I was just saying i am excited to see how it will play out :)
Yeah, I getcha

Ahhh! Engrish

I do hope YouTube likes me for change when I upload this animation there
Since I'll try to export it in semi-HD at least, so yeah
I assume this is your first ponified thing? ;)
I made BlazBrony a week back
welcome back, Sirsprinkles
That character select thingie
So, I advertised my forum on here the other day and I got a great new member to join up, I was wondering if anypony would like to join http://mylittleponyfanclub.com ?
ah, i see. i made the assumption that it was the first pony thing you uploaded to youtube hence you mentioning change. my bad
Where all of cartoonlion's art removed from Ponibooru?
Well, I have one silly video there, and then some prior experience to that
Since I used to upload stuff under another name, but I pretty much left that account to rot

Ok
*Oh

I don't know a pony who doesn't like Fluttershy ;)
"Like"? Sure
Not my favorite though
my sis hates her i dont nkow why
Did she say why?

Beatline: whatt kind would you like? =3
Beef stew from a can, Mi Goreng noodles in a cup, marinated chicken wings and chips
/me 's tummy is full

Fruit bar, bowl of rice, oatmeal. my diet is so odd.
It probably would indeed be a salad sandwich
Those are my speciality after all ^_^
/me is bored .-.

12Hello ~
I didn't do it on purpose!
...ooh.
How could you!
I just suddenly had an amazing idea
It would be awesome if someone would make, like, places from Equestria and ponies for Comic Chat
06How goes? :3

12I'm good thanks, yourself? :3
New dresses for the what, now?
...yeah ,not many people are familiar with it.
/me is not one of those people
It's a really old IRC client Microsoft made.
Basically it worked like any old IRC client, except that it gave everyone avatars in a comic panel
And everything people said was put in speech bubbles, and it would attempt to infer mood from what was said.
I think I have an example from a chat somewhere, hold on
http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/ISee.jpg
^
http://www.nautilus-solar.net/misc/MFComicChat.png It's there, but forewarning it has some naughty words D:
That made me lol.
Indeed.
But yeah
If someone made ponies for it, and some Equestria backgrounds, there's high lolz potential

Woulda said "miles" but I can only think in metric and I'm not sure if there are 400 miles in Ireland.
/me distributes delicious sandwiches
There probably are if you went around the perimeter
06Just to be sure, the same mbps as speedtest returns or what? :P
06and hi Xanbreons
And perhaps not even then, I mean Great Britian is like roughly 1200 miles from end to end.
02well. this is just plain weird .-.
**Great Britain
This sandwich has no chocolate chip in it.
Why would you want chocolate chips in your salad? D:
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET ONE IN MY COOKIE
Mmmmm
If chocolate chips in your bread is your thing, you can have a brioche.
/me has notoriously strange taste in sandwiches, but hey, they're good.
Fold your wings, Nuclear -.-
French Pain au Chocolat, now that's where the delicious is.
Heh
Chocolate brioche is essentially the same thing, to my knowledge.
02LOL, I'll have to re-download Tf2
First had one in Paris, in the Louvre cafe. I also remember seeing the Mona Lisa on that visit.
02such a nice time to have decent internet connection.
Nice
But I remember the pain au chocolat more
I've never been to Paris myself
Though have travelled a reasonable amount
Furthest afield I've ever been is Pennsylvania.
I haven't. I've been to Paris, Rome and two Polish cities.
I've been to Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Sweden, Switzerland, and very briefly Ohio, Germany and France. Or at least I think I passed through Germany.
BARCELOOOONA
SUCH A BEAUTILFUL HORIZON
*etc*
Don't know where he found a horizon, it's all buildings.
Every directions.
...please tell me I'm not the only one who remembers that song >>
Especially when you're inside an opera house.
And yes, that's very true
Can't find any Nightmare Moon lineart :(

I may need to replace this keyboard soon
I hope I get this job I'm being interviewed for on Frday
Then I could afford to.

That's why I prefer non-lyrical music

Thanks! ^^

I have one here
06oh god it's one of those topics I'll add to again and again and again and edit my post and and
06asdf
It's a Logitech I have
06I must restrain myself

well
I'll reply
I've had it a good five years roughly
as soon as my fingers start working agin

Oh
It's taken a good deal of abuse.
I see
I know I've spilled my drink on it at least thrice throughout its life.
hello
Hellew
I need a new power unit...
06LOl
But yeah I have the MX5500 Revolution set.
06lol*
oO;
The mouse is an absolute joy to use <3
At least it is for me, I imagine if I was left-handed I would hate it.
Really I just need a new keyboard. Preferably one aimed more towards gaming, I'd like that.
Anybrony home?
^
This one, while great, isn't really geared for it. I'd love one that's backlit and all.
02this Internet connection is insane .-.

Hi Dman
Hi Rodman
Heya, Barry
Also some day I'd love to get one of those really high end joysticks that have a separate throttle lever and stuff
06I can't complain about my connection so ~
Even if its primary use would be playing After Burner II via MAME XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOd2pq4jVSs
But yeah. My MX5500 has suffered at least three spillages throughout its life, and it looks a tad beaten up.
*click*
But it still works.
I'm saving up for a pair of high-end speakers
Bowers & Wilkins MM1
Super expensive
Only a pair? Not like a 5.1 or 7.1 system?
I hate anything above 2.0
02well...
cool vid
02meaaaanwhileee
I have a rather tiny room
06FLOOF
Ahh
I have a reasonably sized room
Plus my soundcard does a good job of upmixing everything into 5.1
Souncard!
Lunch tiemz :P brb
i'll finish vid when i come back
Creative Labs Professional Titanium X-Fi Fatal1ty series?
Yah. I actually have a separate one rather than using onboard, because I care about how stuff sounds. XD
Me too!
Not an X-Fi, no
It is a Creative one
Ok, set that up to start up automatically when I connect to this server.
It's a slightly older Audigy
They tell me all the time that a soundcard is not necessary, but only when you actually care about how things sound lol.
Because it stops every time I DC.
Hi Dari
hurray
also hi
also, i'm off to lunch brb
Hey.
Bye.
XD
XD
Yeah I have a sigmatel from creative labs in this old Dell XPS M1330....
And yeah, after the first time I had a SoundBlaster there's no way I'd go without a dedicated soundcard nowadays.
Hi DR!
ello
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpjdd2Ga2u0
Hellew
But yeah. It's a Audigy SE IIRC. nothing special, but way way better than the onboard sound on this machine.
Yeah good to knowo
I cannot wait to get my own desktop and install a soundcard
Posted, Xeli
I want to record audio in 32-Bit/256KHz Linear Pulse Coded Modulation!
oh boy XD
Xeli
I think I quoted some things you've said
Hello everybrony
at least 5 times
._.
Sup Rodman
"tl;dr as long as people don't try to shove their opinions down someone else's throat, I'm happy."
that's from you iirc
So, how's everbrony doing?
24-bit is as high as mine goes
I'm good. eating. you?
I dunno what sample rate it goes up to but I know it's patently ridiculous.
Yeah I figured that
I'm good, too
With that said, when i have money enough to upgrade my PC, I'll likely be getting something far more insane than what i have currently.
I think it's 24-Bit samples with a 192KHz sampling frequency.
Just had dinner, so good in that aspect.
Could I have a link to the ponychan thread regarding schedule please?
rodman, schedule is here, in 'home' i think
I think it's definitely worth the price it only takes up 1 PCI-E port anyways
above the chat
I'm divided between being reasonably sane and building a hex core machine based on an AMD chip, or going mental and building a 24-core machine using two intel hex cores and hyperthreading.
Thats cool, but I have to go now so i'll see you later man!
Seeya~!

I like how they use the Super Mario Bros USA main theme for it
0: D
0It's used in a few 'lolwtflol' vids on youtube. it's popular
Grand and happy.
I'm laughing for real right now

Snake? SNAK!
0I love this vid

that's good
In denial about the passage of time and the burden of social demands but otherwise good.
Snake? SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!
^
...what does that mean?
That thing RainbowDash just did?
means she agrees
SAKI
v
like when one says ditto
Strange thing to agree with, but very well.
It's like replying to someone's comment in a thread with "This".
Also, I'm back.
I know people use it to agree, but that just confused me.....
Yeah.
mm, salad
Lazy way to say "Me too" or "What they said"
Oh my, are you coming on to me? #oo#
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
no...?
Not the salad. TRUS me. /Apple Bloom
TRUST*
That was cute
0EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
lol
the MLP one
You wanna truss Apple Bloom, #equestriaafterdark
0:3 sure was
0So RDash you didn't know that video?
0:O

If Pinkie Pie goes AEIOU on Season 2, heart-attack instantly
Just because BigMac keeled over dead after eating a sandwich I made doesn't mean there's anything bad about them! =(
0:O!!!!!!!!!!
Those were some very random videos haha.
0DO WANT
0"aeiou, silly :3"
I don't want to Bake Apple Bloom! D:
0I want this in season 2!
Just because your sandwich killed him doesn't mean your cutie mark failed, either.
HASBRO! HUB! TAKE MY MONEY ALL OF IT!
Derpy derped oo
Dman I might have seen part of the first one. Kind of rings a bell
0=]
Well true
Who's Minamimoto?
I was just being silly there
0:o
Maybe your special talent is lethal sandwiches.
That and making reference to how the other ponies flip out when their talent fails.
0He is an important character in the NDS videogame 'TWEWY'
0or, The World Ends WIth You
And noooo, I make good sandwiches =(
never played it
0a squeenix game.
0My no.1 DS game ^_^
If it was lethal sandwiches I would know =(
!espeon
0The story line is insane.people die, and have 1 week to play a game, so whoever wins that game can come back 2 life
0but there's an entry fee
And immunity to lethal sandwiches.
0your entry fee (you were a loner antisocial dude) is your memories
Salad, are you a mare of a stallion?
or*
0so you only find this out WAAAAY later
0but you entered, were told the rules and how to survive and win, then were lost your mind
That depends, do you want to know which it is in reality or which it is in here? :3
0so the game actually starts with you there
0and erryone ignores you (acnt see the dead)
0ur like 'wat?' then u get attacked by monsters and stuff
0so after 1 week (7 levels) you win
hmm, based on the joke i'm about to make depending on your gender, it doesn't matter :P
Ah
0then it turns out during the week you bonded to your friends, and also only 1 can pass
...-_-
gimme the pony one for privacy's sake then XP
0DEM BASTERDS let a girl you really like pass
0and say winners are give na chance to play again
0(ojnly 1 passes)
*derp*
!muffin
0DEM BASTERDS make HER your entry fee as she became most important thing
!mail DerpyBot So-Glad-You-Survived-Surgery card
Salad Sandwich the pony is a female =p
0 7 more levels go by,l AMAZIN story, and you win again
/me has no pony persona
Muffins!! You have any? :3
For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
yes
0they let another bro pass, and you get to reenter AND it turns out the thing that NOW is most important to you (avter story and bonding) is other players
0so your entry fee is other players ... you then play 7 days almost on your own.
then it makes sense that her special talent is making sandwiches :P /tasteless joke
hm
0then there's a 22nd day where stuff. goes. down.
...
/me hoofs AppleDash in the face
0that's kinda your character's story in an utshell
ah
hey, i'm just messing
thats hot
And bleeding
0thers a lot more story, as expected from square enix, but all in all it's my fave ds game ^_^
0HNNNNNNNNNG
Lethality theory confirmed.
...and honestly? The better joke would have been about tossing sald~ ^^
HEY
lol
NEWFAAAG!
:O
But yeah.
Hello Shaico.
wait...
>hot
>bleeding
I'll be making a pony persona better matched to the real person some time soon.
>hemmrhoids?
0heh...heh...so what's a videogame you realli like?
Zelda
Mario
Hey Fally.
Pokemon
0yay~
0yay~
0yay~
But being in here as Salad is fun
0so far so gut
Saban should re-air the Power Rangers Movie
yes, rp-ing is sure fun :)
0make it ur b movie :3
My primary sticking point with making a pony persona that matches the person is thinking up a suitable name and cutie mark. Lolz
I already know more or less how it would look.
/me doesn't really get the whole RPing thing either, but whatever floats one's boat....
I will, if I ever get a chance to select the B Movie
If you get it before I do, will you do it, DMan?
0I would
0I don't know what i'd pick for a b movie
0i have like 5 a movie picks
0errybody in mah house about to have siesta lol. i'm gonna watch a movie. still i'll be here too =]
K
0id go something like 'For Barry - power ranger movie' or osmehing
0but i haven't ever been picked yet >_<

Hellew

13ohai :3
0they're all one and the same
0also, >dat conan the barbarian 'riders' theme
13!espeon
0"Riddle of Steel Riders of Doom" is the name of the song, incase anybrony is interested
/me tosses you some Cold killer X
06can someone try !Cloudey please?
13!cloudey
06hm... weird...
:P
Curse these ponies, they drive me to fanfic!
0WOW! the intro to 'legend of the guardians' is impressive
:P
Hmm, just whipped up a pony persona with a creator
Tall and lanky. Seems about right.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaTonseQSY
What creator? Need a model sheet for Parchment.
0w00t
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSdV0ijEeno&feature=related
0Barry - have you seen the 2004 E3 reaction to that traier? Goosebumps for like 5 minuts
^
It's fairly versatile
0wow! haven't seen trailer 2 in sooo loong thank youuu :3
Anyway now I have a reference model I need a name...
06varreset4
Anybrony remeber this game?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHhHnxBpZF0
06weir.....
0do I ever
0NewDCD wants to stream that very game
:P
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC5dkk6sAfw&feature=related Sorry the music is so faint
YES!
Sorry the music is so faint
Preferably something suitably arty sounding seeing as I'm into making music and drawing, and sometimes writing.
From my end, NewDCD's got a supporter there
0Barry - "don't want you no more." That theme song. I LOVE.
0(the one in dat trailer)
0Rodman - i'll tell him if you're not around =]
Alrighty, thanks
0"Don't want you no more"
0so much nostalia in dat song
Niiiice.
Sketchy Sounds? :3
Derp
Actually, that sounds pretty good.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3ct4Si7sS4
Awesome, now all I have to do is come up with a cutie mark lol
The final trailer
A pencil crossing a treble cleff?
Er, "clef".
One f.
0i love TP
That could work.
0same theme there :3
Or a quill pen perhaps
TP was good, but it could have been so much better
02*yawns* good morning
i.e. that instead of the pencil
0It could have
Let's hope they do Skyward Sword right
0mostly because it was a gamecube port : /
10Hey Sunny
06heya Skylands
02hi sky ^^
Although that's really associated more with writing, and I do more music and drawing than writing.
06and hiii Sunny!
Pencil it is I suppose.
0Miyaomto: "if SS isn't the best zelda i might stop zelda"
Heh. Mine's a quill across an unrolled scroll.
/me huggles big bro Charizard Sunny
02hi cloudey
I thought it was a Wii port that was later transferred to Gamecube?
/me hugs back n_n
0two days later miyamoto: "I believe SS is the best zelda ever"
or do I have the roles reversed
0Barry no
I really, really, REALLY hope that gamble pays of for them
0Yea reversed =]
0Look at the textures! for a wii game
so do I
...oh gosh this is going to be a pain to draw though
0teehee
right
I'm used to drawing the normal-sized mane cast
Although Parchie is less /my/ ponysona than he is a proxy for any fanfic/art brony.
0acme out for gc about 4 months before in japan
0and like 2 months after elsewhere, but it's a gc game
And Sketchy here is ginormous XD
/me nods
Practice with Big Macintosh?
They took what? Five, six years on the game?
...that sounds wrong XD
SS
0SS
0hmm
0brb
Besides, he's busy applebucking ;p
:D
0 06 11
So draw him applebucking! :D
0that's 5 years
0^_^
If they can't make a good zelda game after that long a period of time, they should stop trying to make Zelda games
...how do i register a nick again? :x
0then again, Link tot hte past took 5 years and OoT was 6 years
0I guess so
/me fails IRC
it's in the rules ;)
0apparently skyward sword will have instruments like other zeldas
Cool
0one point only in one trailer shows link with a Harp
0...:P
i guess he doesn't like rules :<
Lol.
0also, have you seen the backgrounds?
a harp? Not a lyre, a harp?
0or lyre
0the Sheikah thing
Lyre
./ns REGISTER <password> <Email>
a harp is a gigantic thing
0instead of fog there's a neato thing where stuff further away gets blobbier in art style
0it's amazing
Or do you want grouping?
0and yea barry just realised doh
Maybe grouping would be better seeing as I have Salad_Sandwich as well.
uh grouping sounds kinky
:D
I just realized, Lyra's cutie mark is a lyre, but we've never seen her with it
Basically, the draw distance got combined with the art style to make something beautiful
wat. lol
/me groups Celestia
well, gtg i'll cya later
0True dat
Umm..,
How do I group?
:O
Truss?
0wonder how Lyra got it
XDD
well bye
I hope Season two gives Lyra some lyre time
Grouping=OT3+ shipping?
0and Rodman / Barry seen the latest trailer?
/me still doesn't get how to group.
Silly me.
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
For SS?
./ns GROUP <Salad_Sandwich> <Password>
0(there's a section with a city and another with sky flying)
0yea
For your nick ofc.
0stuff further away is just .... pure art
0closer you get more detailed art becomes
No, let me go look for it
0till it's there
So that should reserve this nick for my use then?
That makes Salad_Sandwich the main and adds Sketchy_Sounds to that group.
Sweet
This one?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zm1tLH1Oks
0lemme see
That's simpler than separately registering them.
0I think that's the one i'm on about
Right
:D
I should have a shot at drawing Sketchy I guess.
0hmm...maybe
0ah yup
0that's the one =]
And maybe draw Salad again as I goofed on her last time
13Have you ever bought a food/drink/whatever specifically for YOU to eat, only to find that someone else has had it later? D:
Yeah, to separately register them, you need seperate email addresses for them.
I can't wait for this game
/me got as far as inking her completely, then noticed several glaring errors including a missing accessory and butt cover
0My most anticipated game this year
Flying whatchamacallit FTW!
06yes...
06i raged ;.;
I bet it was your most anticipated game ever since you learned of it, DMan
13When I went food shopping with my mum, I put a packet of fig rolls in the shopping basket specifically because I wanted to eat them sometime
13just now I went to look for them
13and I find an empty packet of fig rolls in the living room
13;-;
13WHY
Although that said part of the reason I forgot to draw her butt cover was so I could show her mark.
0rodman - your face when after 20 years the logo on the hyrule shield is that bird
...I probably also should stop calling it a butt cover
0Barry - pretty much
:O
I just am not sure what the thing I have on her in AiP's pony maker is meant to be.
0although i..hmm... ... ... Pretty much :P
06:3
0Rodman Lul
06because
ARE YOU FOR SERIOUS?!?!?
06<3
I /think/ it's a skirt of some sort.
0my face was just :O
Spoiler, Ganon will not be in this game
0HAHAHA
13BUT
13they were for me
0heard that Barr
13and my dad ate them all
13D:
/me shrugs
No Ganon might be a good thing though.
/me goes to floof up a dad....
Evolution
MUFFINS
06WITH A SHOTGUN!
/me flees
Anyway
See what else they can come up with
SURPRISE US NINTENDO!
Sketchy seems to be Celestia-tier lankiness
0rodman this game is confirmed to be the earliest in possible timeline of sorts
They had Vaati, Majora, what's next
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
yes
Earliest so far
Thank you!!
/me glomps Balloons
0so before any other game, as ninty put it, if there WERE a timeline
Which he should be because he's supposed to be tall and slim.
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
The mother of all prequels?
Alicorns :D
No =(
/me walks away with a drooping tail
06.-.
That's pretty darn tall and slim.
13also hiiiiii Espeon <3
13!espeon
06Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
/me already belongs to you, silly :3
06<3
Yah well
Indeed, Rod
0spose so
Celestia isn't pony-proportioned. She's a My Little Winged/Horned HORSIE.
It leads up to Ocarina of Time
Seeing as I'm basing him on my own attributes it's to be expected
/me is 6'6" iRL and kinda skinny
0ah here it is
That just reminds me of this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCbp5LTgbU

3 inches more than me
always are...
0ah here it is http://i.imgur.com/tXR2Y.png
*Snerk* We talking about height here?

Heh, I'm Big Mac's height.

Hey Sketch ^^
/me can live with being silly
Hello there Summer.
13Silly is fun :P
Hey Beatline. How's it goin'?
FAN THEORY MOMENT
@1:20, Dash was here
0GIEF
So anyway now I have this nick grouped, it'll ask for the password for this nick too, yes?
0lol
Quite alright.
Though I have to head off in an hour or so.
SS: yup.
Sketch: I Believe so..
Sweet
SS establishes the Kingdom of Hyrule and the monarchical rule of Zelda's family
^_^
I can swap gender on the fly lol
..
XD
Sketchy_Sounds: yes but you can switch beteween grouped nicks without giving the pass.
Heh, I should so add Parchie's pen name.
02back
Thus, the giant birds become the symbol of Hyrule for all games of the past!
Oh sweet, that's very handy
(Speaking of swapping genders.)
06Many things are :3
02I get distracted so easily xD
I do that constantly. xD
02hi espeonS
Handy
02=3
13Lol distractions
0and the master sword's birth, apparently
Voila!
13tell me about it
13|D
...
Hey RD,
/me whistles
0but yea Rodman that pic i put blew me away
^^
06i'ma guilty too
There we go.
06at school + distraction = FAIL
/me is still known as FallSilently
13Right now, this chat is distracting me from eating my food
And voila.
13and it's getting cold
13;w;
Et voila! here, too.
soooo..
I think I'll leave Sketchy as an Earth pony as opposed to making him like a pegasus or anything snazzy.
06EAT YOUR FOOD
06Don't be distracted from it again.
06I will be here allllll day so don't worry
/me hides
I dunno what type of pony i will be, what my cutie mark is, or what my pony name will be according to my cutie mark when it arrives..
Earth pony artist. Nimble lips, eh? Annnnd that just went someplace cloppy without my meaning it to.
13BUT IT'S COLD NOW
that vid... wha-- huh?
13I don't feel like eating it anymore
13D:
02microwave it
02xD
/me waggles eyebrows
13I already did LOL
02is it breakfast?
13Erm
13lunch?
02xDD
13I just got out of bed about an hour ago |D
/me whickers
You use your eyebrows?
0lol
02me too xD
Even more impressive.
Hey if Octavia can play a cello or whatever it is with her hooves, no reason Sketchy can't manage similar stuff.
06microwaved food is eh
/me is Parchment's SUPER SECRET pen name for when he writes romance novels.
Aye.
..
02but im too lazy to pour me some cereal
SHHHH!
06and HOW CAN YOU STAY IN BED THAT LONG
Don't tell anyone.
06like really
02nothing wrong with microwaved food espeon xD
06much more than until 1pm and I start feeling uncomfortable for some odd reason :<
welll...
(It's a metaphor for accepting being a brony.)
13I'm God tier in lazy
13that's how ;3
what shall we discuss?
06nothing wrong with it but it's kind of 5/10, middle tier, okay but not better
^^
06and I can live with that :3cccc
02xDD
...although Celestia knows how he'd manage playing even half of the stuff I can oO
Time travel makes your head hurt
02im being so lazy now myself... just laying on my beach chair (the only I have on my room
Seeing as I play guitar, drums, piano, ocarina and shinobue, to name a few.
02not the ones with the plastic stripes
13I'm on a green computer chair
Drums I can kinda see
06tommorow, when the sun rises
02the fabric ones with the cup holder xD
13which used to be my gaming chair downstairs
06i'll be in a car, in the mountains!
Salad: That's amazing. I wish I knew, but making music isn't my thing.. just listening to it is.
But guitar... I've no idea.
13but then my mum broke the computer chair we used to have
13so it had to be replaced by this ;-;
02I want a gaming chair
02xD
02how did she?
0you are taught te song of storms so you can teach the song of storms so you can be taught te song of storms so you can teach the song of storms so you can be taught te song of storms so you can teach the song of storms so you can be taught
Although at least he'd have no problem with the music making part, i.e. using software for it.
13Well it'd been "half-broken" for a while I guess
02xD
/me ... hugs his chair?
13she leaned back on it and the back of the chair fell off LOL
06comfy
06and o.o
la la la la la
Summer, you ever play any of the Sonic games?
13I just wish I was there to see it happen |D
Not as impressive as Pinkie Pie's musical virtuoso Salad.
02with a camera?
02xD
13Yes
13LOL
And true, Pinkie's one pony band was quite impressive
02YOUTUBE!!!! xD
/me was a big Sonic fan
But yeah as I was about to say, I've done some arrnagements and remixes of Sonic music
Sonic became a werewolf. I cried inside.
I got my hands on a Mega Drive soundfont and started making 16 bit versions of 8 bit tracks :3
Stable time loop
Unleashed is actually fun, though.
I quite liked Unleashed.
Let's leave it at that
0indeedio
Not quite Sonic, but still decent.
.. not a big gamer-filly.
I have played the original Sonic by Sega i think..?
Got the PS2 version since I can't afford a PS3 yet. :(
13That reminds me, I have a video on youtube of two of my friends badly singing My Heart Will Go On on karaoke
13they've been wanting me to take it down for ages
.. :p
02xD
Basically, you could learn the Song of Storms, because it was a song you yourself created
http://www.nautilus-solar.net/music/Jungle16bit.mp3 If you ever played the original 8-bit Sonic you'll recognise this.
you just forgot
0cuh-RAY-ZEE
0nah
0you just hadn't learned it yet
0...
0you created the song, but you hadn't learned it yet 0_o
06o.o
Hadn't learned it from yourself, that is
Sonic was too fast paced for me. I like to explore.
8bit sonic?, oh from the master system and gamegear.
13Ok this food is too cold now
Yeah
Actually now i think on it

String walks into a bar. Bartender says "Hey! We don't serve your kind here!"
The horse then files a discrimination lawsuit against the establishment.
Sketchy walks into a bar. The barman shoots him.
D:
T_T Basically everyone in there is either asleep or away.
So the string goes outside, gets so mad it ties itself in knots and gets all frazzled on the ends.
can people join me in Bucket? XD I ish bored.
What is the purpose of Bucket of Holding?
Argon walks into a bar. The bartender yells, "Hey, get out of here!" Argon doesn't react.
Angry, it goes back in. Bartender says "Hey, aren't you that string was in here a minute ago?"
"Nope. I'm a frayed knot."
"Nope, I'm a frayed knot."
Beatcha to it.
/me fails
I love that joke.
I type fast.
Don't forget the one about the panda

I wasn't talking to you, I was stating something
The NZT, I mean
0it's not addictive at all, but the difference it makes to your life ... Yes it is in taht sense:P
