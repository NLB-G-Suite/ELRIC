\w/ -_- \w/
Arti can probably make that and most people should as well
7Rescheduling the meeting a day before it occurs isn't the best option, though.
9eh, it's full
Femurs aren't PG? I'd say lack of femurs isn't PG...
oh my.....
"MUSHROOM!!!!!!!

MONOPOLY?!
Celestia Radio plays monopoly?
relationships are pg rainbow dash, but not whats done behind closed doors
Nukin Equestria are ya?

/me does specify specific cuddly-kissy scenes though
7What don't you get?
oh yeah I remember now, Dman.
Nothing graphic, but...
7Don't take that as some sort of imperative interrogation.
...
rainbow dash would never be cuddly-kissy
i just dont see it in her
...
Ok then :3

Twilight is cool
it's an IRCchat
Rainbow is cool
and..
uhm
hey misti
hows the other one called
I like all of 'em, but I'd put Rarity last if I had to make a list. That's the only notable thing
Rarity
is also cool
is there even one episode where twilight isnt in it?
LUNA WONT YOU CRY FOR ME!!!!
Yes!
rarity is the best pony :(
he's epic
mind telling me when this is live?
Pinkie by "or" i meant i cant decide between you rarity or twilight
mrponiatior same here, except fluttershy would be last for me

Well, she is the main of the mane six
oh
Nah
she has the most screen time
Well, I guess she's the "mane character" after all, even if some episodes don't revolve arpund her
Twilight is onscreen like 50% of the time
/nick someone_else
then, surprisingly, applejack has the next highest
I like the cmc more than some of the mane 6
ugh

Wtf is going here?

Applejack has second most screentime because shes awesome
Why is prison on the stream?

Actually, my preferred shipping is Rarijack

SilverMane: Rarity's Rodeo is by Somber.

And because it's awesome.
Maturity is good. Just finished reading it a bit ago.
I find FiM rule 34/clopfics freakin' hilarious.
D_man, it's just a matter of saying no. I have gained excellent self control regarding that due to ponies
until just then
ooh he did
I thought you were being sarcastic

Simply Rarity was... beautiful
I'd disagree with that ^

/me is never interested in sex or "Shipping"
I know, but I'm fine with the regular xD
9we played a bit with him yesterday
9a nerfed version of him, but yeah
Shipping simply refers to any sort of romantic relationships
asakim! yes!
I like to take that concept and reduce it to an object
I like to take that object and put it in my videos
and put it in my videos
you have to scan EVERY DAY then
I don't want Shipping. Most of it is probably lesbian.
i'll watch
Since MLP's cast is mostly female.
Moskau, Moskay, La la la la la la la, la la la la la la, ho ho ho ho ho, HEY!
I don't have any
9I write shipping. Straight Shipping, that is.
Same goes for bronibooru
Lame got excited
Like the two parodies of "Rainbow Dash ships with everypony"
9I like romance, that's it. I've always been a hopeless romantic.
I could give you Scootagoose
I haven't scanned in weeks
Well, I don't want to call it a "disaster" fic.

I avoid FF for many reasons :P

9and hten
9when GOOD games come for the console
9Reggie fucks us up
9so yeah.
yup
p'haps
/me chucks a pinecone at BonBon's face
hey everyone
last year i have bought nothing
They've messed up this past year for sure.
Oh thank you Retsamoreh, you're my only real friend
9yeah, me and thousands of other gamers
/me is a clever girl
I hope you explode!
and downloaded cod, justdance1/2 for sister (haven't played 1 second of them) and uh
9don't be such a fanboy. I remember when I was like you, trying to defend the Wii.
actually, last year I got the two Resident evil games for wii.
9yet the Wii brought naught.
9so I said "fuck this".
What's up with this Trixie eating pinecones nonsense?
Someone! Stab her off of me!
Pinecones are nutricous
/me stabbity STAB stab
Hellllppppp~
wait wuh?!
CODES IN MY BRAWL?!
9and stopped defending it
Oh
Ok I'm going to sleep
Well
WHERE ARE THE SHEETS
Whats the matter Retsamoreh? you want more hugs?
9don't get me wrong, kiddo
!Flip
/me flies up in the air and does a backflip
/me hugs harder
9but on the long run
It's 2 bits a hug
/me runs from drf before he says "EW"
9the Wii is terrible.
/me droops head, feels a little depressed
It just doesn't have enough games, is the ONLY non-HD console out there.
/me yawns
9third-party support is faltering like you have no idea.
Now, which Locke are you? The philosopher or the cripple?
9and third-party support basically DEFINES a console.
Welp, I got to sleep, touring some colleges tomorrow.
12o-o
12virus!
Uh neither. I named him after the character in FF6
(mad)
There ya go
:3
g'night all
9I'm not placing any hopes on any consoles till they deliver. That's my philosophy from now on.
MACROSS
9I bet on the Wii, and it idssapointed me
GO
Retsamoreh just come down, I promise i wont hug you TOO hard
yeah.
i like having high hopes, but i never buy consoles straight away
9yes, it has SOME games, but far too few.
I guess I'll wait 'til I see the Xbox next console and the PS4.
03http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pokmon-should-have-used-a-super-rod.gif
handhelds up to gameboy
I'm not going to buy the next gen of consoles.
and other old consoles
/me slaps on pony-cleats
and now we are less awesome
Dont make me come up there~
9which my computer can also play
when story?
o lol Kittan
gamecube thou?
http://i.imgur.com/gyjJI.png
9and my computer's monitor is also my TV screen
9so yeah
KITTAN KILLU
/me dumps a few pinecones on ^BonBon's head in defiance
I have about 5 disks with maybe 20 games
I'll take that as a yes
oh, not much. You draw that>?
nuthin much twilight
Hello.
Cleats totally work that way
I can't draw, but.
:D
That won't stop me.
I should draw some ponies too
I'll do anything non-explicit, as long as you don't mind my tiredness and whatnot.
9And these are Wii owners
I mean, I can, but both my handwriting and artistic skills are that of a six year old.
9not the typical PS3HASNOGAEMS guys
TapeDiggety.
Yessir.
9if you aren't, that's nice for you, but really, it doesn't change the facts.
Draw Rets on Twilight's back.
I would link to my DA if no one minds
...
i agree to all the facts and enjoy every console :3
wait
9the worst part is
This is Rets
http://the-time-hero.deviantart.com/favourites/#/d41wcbl
Ooh I can buy a print!
9I never saw it
Yes, and they're talking ponies.
9is it basically the Wii GoldenEye in those consoles?
Basically.
Yeah
9cause the Wii GoldenEye is...decent, but pretty much Cawadoodie with Bond
not even graphical update at all
didn't buy
friend bought thou. silly him.
But yes, Rets resting on the back of a rather disgruntled looking Twilight would be nice.
LELOUCH
Disgruntled Twilight. Band name?
after those kills
9I'm thinking of getting a capture card to stream Disaster: Day of Crisis though
tis 6 30 and i'll probs be woken up at like 8 9 10ish
http://exranion.deviantart.com/
it's good t see you buddy how've you been
9Disaster and the NMH series are pretty much the reason to own a Wii
and the gunmen
Have fun!
oh haven't played NMH yet
i'd really wish you let us in.
Thank you TapeDiggety!
I think I speak for all of us
When I say I understand
Diggity*
Why you folks might hesitate
Don't thank me yet. Doin' it's always the hard part.
9not really

sound explosion
sound died down again
but here's an FYI
you're all gonna die screaming
9but yeah I wish I had gotten a PS3 instead
9sound okay now?
yeah
Do it now
I've got a PS3 strictly for exclusives.
^this
I scream for fun.
I was actually thinking of doing Pony/Need for Speed
We're not unreasonable
I have a PS3 for free online play, but I don't play online much anymore.
I was just going to work the alternate universe angle
>dualshock controllers
We're at an impasse here
DAT DYNAMISM
Maybe we should compromise
i'm surprised
not to say offended
wow that was unpleasent
I may write this myself
Missed supper
Went downstais to get food
At 1:32....
Mine don't.
G'night for a whiile
not the sticks the thumgs
The dogs kept barkin at me!
-_-
Of course , this depends on the player i'm not saying it sucks
But at least i have food :3
Mine don't.
I'm writing a story that's a loos cross over with Valkryia Chronichles.
but ME, i hit my thumbs when with left stick i go right, while also, with right stick going left.
I would write it
but I have no talent
It's not really a cross over but it has enough for me to at least call it a loose cross over.
If I leave my thumbs on top of the sticks they collide.
Give it a shot
...
You can my young student
I have average skill in a lot things, but good at nothing.
</celestia>
DMAN, GET READY.
Well
Chef boy R dee
yum yum
I guess it is soon.
well I'm good at math. Or at least the math I've learned.
/me is back
I honestly don't have a controller preference.
Okay but I still call making Pony Need for Speed. I don't think my editor feels like handling two stories though.
UH OH
/me is willing to edit somepony's story…
fffuuu
whoa
Doot doot
*Sigh*
OH DAMN
and fell on the floor myself
derp
Well I also don't feel like working on three stories.

It is odd
You could do this BlacklightShining
VIRAAAAAL

BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF VIRAL'S ENKIDU NOW
I was just going to say "In an alternate universe ponies drive fast"

I'm not saying you should throw rocks at kids, but, I dunno, a movie?
I cant even get near people without SOMEONE making fun of me

Just likelyhood of actually using that... -5%

[off-topic] are there any non-malicious uses of ping -f ?
goodnight sweat pony dreams!
ping f?
-f - do not frag packets
oh, fragment flag?
-f Flood ping. Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one
hundred times per second, whichever is more. For every
ECHO_REQUEST sent a period ``.'' is printed, while for every
ECHO_REPLY received a backspace is printed. This provides a
rapid display of how many packets are being dropped. Only the
super-user may use this option. This can be very hard on a net-
work and should be used with caution.
I posted the intro; http://www.forums.rainbowdash.com/index.php?topic=140.0
seems to me the only use for it is DDoS'ing a site
In the fic, that is.
ill read it definitely
oh you
great..i is not alone :)
run that from a bunch of different computers…
:D
You'd probably be able to guess why I named the violinist Four Fifths, too.

hello ClockworkPie
it provides an non-malicious use in it's won description :p
if you've got a dodgy network and you want something to flood the network with to see what's happening, flood ping is simple and effective

12did you ever even try anything else?
Do you want a Castlevania, or Metroidvania?
I'd prefer a normal one, seeing I don't like the metroidvania aspect in SotN, DoS, etc
12hmm
12i am always afraid to cook meat
Metroids are fine, but in games like SotN the exploration feels quite bland

It's like begging a perhaps needless chapter to already finished story

Easy to remember
hopefully soon :D
ponies!
(i really don't have any -.-)
I just hope it is as good as S1, even if it is a little worse, that would still be good enough for me :D
I imagine there'll be more nods to the fanon from the background ponies.
I just hope they don't overdo those
S1 had the right amount imo
Like when she paused in front of the camera when Dash & Fluttershy arrived for the Young Fliers, or her front-row seat at Fluttershy's fashion show.
you think they overdid the derpy eyes?
Yes....
I want another winter episode too -.-
That'd be cool....
though with his lack of popularity i doubt it happening

It is a bit flat.
I like the SFIV graphical style. Chunky and cartoony.
Makes Mortal Kombat characters look like wimps.
Well, I'll rather take my (mostly skinny) anime characters in BB
Aaaaand there it is.

Yoo
hehe
hi
Yo
Yoo
Heh
Haha
As long as the character doesn't try to use frame traps
the clip
Coolio
Next weekend to Umeå
Same here. I've been to a few Street Fighter tournaments but they generally whup me badly.
:U
Can't agree more.
I still had fun.
I knew I'd be beaten.
But yeah, fighting games are kinda niche seeing how much you need to put time into them to be good and all
I'm not saying it can't be fun for people to play that much and get that good, I just know it's not for me.
Yeah, bots are rather random or more or less predictable
I don't look into framedata charts (while I do understand 'em)
I did! awesome time
I've heard of it
wrong channel
but hi :)
/me is back
Heard the name, know nothing about it.
Or hey! Ibuki's U1 has one less frame start-up on reversal!
Exactly.
Yeah, SFIV was kinda the same kind of deal to me
Blazblue and MK9 were the only fighting games over the last 3 years that have really grabbed me.
Well, SF is one of those definining serieses
-in*
Hi
Hey-o
Hellew
Also while I do understand the differences between different shoto characters, I prefer variety, even if it results in a smaller roster
Like BB, none of the characters are alike in multitude of ways
Among other things
I want Mane6 to come out already.
CS2 balanced the things pretty nicely
But now there's CS2+, which supposedly changes the balance again
Yeah, that was quite something
The one on PSP?
CS1 = BBCS ver. 1.00
1.01 adds Makoto
1.02 adds Valkenhayn
For example with the balance changes, Bang is S-tier in CS1, but middle/low in CS2
And I guess that's enough of me being nerdy about BB
Hey
Yeah, I can figure
That's rather distressing
First time here
Fgiures, even though I was the first.
Damn posers.
Well, someone just beat you to it
Probably someone using it in a different name meaning
Its an actual name of cvourse.
The registered Octavia's a regular. She'll probably be in later, this is a bit early for her I think.
Well, in that case that quite stinks
Mhmm.
I'm the "Octavia" in the comments on the blog too.
You've registered there?
Mhm.

I posted as "Derpy Hooves" for a while too.

French Pain au Chocolat, now that's where the delicious is.

Chocolate brioche is essentially the same thing, to my knowledge.
02LOL, I'll have to re-download Tf2
First had one in Paris, in the Louvre cafe. I also remember seeing the Mona Lisa on that visit.
Nice
But I remember the pain au chocolat more
I've never been to Paris myself
Though have travelled a reasonable amount
Furthest afield I've ever been is Pennsylvania.
I haven't. I've been to Paris, Rome and two Polish cities.
I've been to Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Sweden, Switzerland, and very briefly Ohio, Germany and France. Or at least I think I passed through Germany.

Er, "clef".

That could work.
0same theme there :3
0It could have
Let's hope they do Skyward Sword right
0mostly because it was a gamecube port : /
Although that's really associated more with writing, and I do more music and drawing than writing.
02hi cloudey
I thought it was a Wii port that was later transferred to Gamecube?
/me hugs back n_n
or do I have the roles reversed
0Barry no
I really, really, REALLY hope that gamble pays of for them
0Yea reversed =]
...oh gosh this is going to be a pain to draw though
0teehee
right
I'm used to drawing the normal-sized mane cast

That makes Salad_Sandwich the main and adds Sketchy_Sounds to that group.
you just tell nickserv group nick password

0hmm...maybe
0ah yup
0that's the one =]
And maybe draw Salad again as I goofed on her last time
13Have you ever bought a food/drink/whatever specifically for YOU to eat, only to find that someone else has had it later? D:
/me got as far as inking her completely, then noticed several glaring errors including a missing accessory and butt cover
06yes...
06i raged ;.;
13When I went food shopping with my mum, I put a packet of fig rolls in the shopping basket specifically because I wanted to eat them sometime
13just now I went to look for them
13and I find an empty packet of fig rolls in the living room
13;-;
13WHY
...I probably also should stop calling it a butt cover

Seeing as I play guitar, drums, piano, ocarina and shinobue, to name a few.
Drums I can kinda see
06tommorow, when the sun rises
13which used to be my gaming chair downstairs
Salad: That's amazing. I wish I knew, but making music isn't my thing.. just listening to it is.
But guitar... I've no idea.
13but then my mum broke the computer chair we used to have
13so it had to be replaced by this ;-;
02I want a gaming chair
02xD
02how did she?
Although at least he'd have no problem with the music making part, i.e. using software for it.
13Well it'd been "half-broken" for a while I guess
02xD
/me ... hugs his chair?
13she leaned back on it and the back of the chair fell off LOL
06comfy
