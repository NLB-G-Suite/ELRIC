RD is good at voice acting
Twilight cannot be the closest friend to herself.

Future twilight is closest

I assumed she would speak in RD's voice, as this is all technically all taking place in her head.
Si
And then interruption...
anti climactic climax
spanish word for no
oh just gran it
And then she just takes it

How did Yugi aquire the Mellinium Puzzle in the first place?

i actually just play magic. I used to play yugioh, but then I... discovered Magic and found out it's way more intresting and strategic

No one solved this puzzle in a thousand years?
and......................its in the river
Hey a piece is missing!
And then... Unown!
Wow kid, you took five minutes to solve a 5000 year old unsolvable puzzle.

And then Yugi blew up
Hey! Is this radioactive?

Why's he not suprised by all the light and effects?

You acted his TRAP CARD!
They escaped or they ded.

Lets count the deaths
AND DED
Honestly, if you used a 3D scanner to read each piece, and wrote a program for it, a computer could just go through all the possible orientations of all the pieces and figure that in like a week at most....
How long is this, might leave stream and come back for Ponies
Everyone is ded.
i think they died, and this is for kids ?
it would've be censored by 4kids
ROCKS FALL EVERYONE DIES
Yugi caused the deaths of about 20 people that day.

WMC = worst movie clause
To WMC this movie would be BEYOND just biased, it'd be downright stupid.
Is WMC because it could be picked again a good reason for WMC?
currently on the front page of Reddit, that's where i saw it
NO on WMC.

Jeez, this deja vu.
All I can think of is this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP7k-3Tipp4&feature=player_detailpage#t=459s
Bunnies.
Or bunnies, that works too.
*giggles at Dark92Enigma* :)

It's official folks, Season 3's in november, you can stop spoiling now.

Four bunnies.
And one awful pony t-shirt.
05,15I wouldn't have minded rabbit stu.
i've had rabbit stew
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Ja23HfhY&feature=related
it was pretty good actually
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/video/niconico/sm17317029
also Deer i like deer
13hm
a little too much pepper in that batch though
13washing maybe
Any meat becomes beef/chicken/pork with stewing.
lol
13:<
13dunno then :/

wat?
oh yeah
13X3
the Rugrats ep
XD
05,15But he can make me chocolate pudding
Resident Evil Zero was terrible though
05,15Is Stu making pudding still a meme or did that die out?
05,15I liked the Gurren Lagann one
05,15REmake was great
I think it's something that's referenced every now and then.
Not really meme-worthy anymore.
Once in a blue moon.
05,15RE6 is....wat. The reviews, from players and critics alike are all over the place
http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/259/e/4/new_ties_by_raptor007-d5evhfk.jpg
there is a wii one
Ohhh
*i
back from watching Animal Crossing videos
05,15It's always sad to see a meme die.
05,15Guile's Theme was my introduction to ponies
ok looks like my best bet it to soak it in rubing achoholl.
Memes dying? Sad?
The universe cheers every time a meme dies.
In the meantime, caption this http://i45.tinypic.com/281zk7c.png
Resident Evil 6? Oh, you mean Rooty tooty Call of Duty Zombies map Special Bonus Unlock?
Arrow To The Knee wasn't sad.
05,15Let me rephrase that. Good ones that were actually fun
05,15Arrow to the Knee was forced and only got popular because of the idiots that played Skyrim.
But they all stagnate before they die.
They're like flowers.
Pretty for a while then they end up in compost.
i used to be a meme like you but then i i took and arrow to the knee
God....damnit.
05,15Also, waaaaaaaaay too many people like Tosh.O
Just get resident Evil 5 and imagine you get to play as six people now instead of just two
Still no stream? Or should I refresh?
stream over? was away
05,15I hate how one of the characters yells that every 40th kill
Tosh.O ?
Borderlands 2. Aka Borderlands 1.
http://youtu.be/3tH60cNil1g
Feels weird not hearing Moves Like Jagger
A terrible comedy show on Comedy Central.
05,15Zer0 says "Hillarious, you've activiated my trap card"
05,15that's him
It's best playing with friends however
meh
05,15Meanwhile not yet, but I expect DLC with that
http://youtu.be/i7v5wDVDpnc
I don't think I've seen a OG ref in it
yet
tl;dr
what's with the fanfics
OH
I heard TOR is F2P now
05,15Dammit, society is trying to make me hate Gangnam Style
/me plays Rayman Origins :)
Well that didn't take long.
actually, i think i've read this, and i think i get's erotic
Though frankly I'm surprised ToR didn't trip out of the gate and break it's teeth.
05,15It was on the Ellen show the other day too
05,15ToR it pretty much did
it cant be erotic or read before i just wrote it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UvEgxpDcvM
Heard Gangnam Style in a workplace radio yesterday.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ebha1NW5t0
dont mind me
just thouGHT i'd let you know
can't type with one hand
?
lol
OH yeah?
o.o?
that's the joke
05,15Idiots
If I ever wrote a pony fic, it would be about one of them coming to THIS world for a damn change.
anyway gonna go check if it IS F2P
brb
00,02NullRadix, Ping
05,15fuck
lol
05,15Now my meme is bad
busy being an idiot of sorts
05,15But yeah, if you're going to post a meme to mock yolo, don't screw it up.
05,15SINK IT
written in COMIC FUCKING SANS :/
...
See, I don't like HiE stories because they all end up feeling the same.
And i'm back, just switched to my computer.
dammit
it's still not F2P
05,15wat
rule of fanfiction: everythings been done, everything is cliche, mary sue, OOC
:P
not everything has been done.
i knew i would get at least a wat
Sex with the CMC. It's ALL been done.
not by any stretch of any imagination! :D
The sex stories usually done first, sadly.
05,15NOOOOOOOOOO
lol
where is that button?
Stream still ded... :( We didn't even have any move like Jagger :'(
http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
Xp
use as needed
05,15so many conflicted people
05now i can actualyl steer
and some women.
Well do you really want to see Bieber spanking Watson with a riding crop?
Steer?
o/~ Another man done gone.... o/~
05,15Sounds like a bad fanfic
T: Lol'd.
05,15so...like a regular fanfic
Oh.
You mean you don't know it was a Twilight (YES THAT ABOMINATION) fanfic?
"Configuring my joystick"
I would like to see a fanfic that goes against most of the fanon facts
13http://i.imgur.com/3Pqsi.png
After all, history is written by the victors
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaa
http://i.imgur.com/gkKjs.png
here have awesome metal head playing awesome weeaboo songs in metal http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88tNh76Iz-8
http://youtu.be/E2Rx1YHfibg
For all we know, she may have just wanted to extend the night for a few hours originally, Celestia over reacts and in the process of sealing her, gives her the idea of eternal night
yep
E331Rock?
05hahaha
05im not dying!
05,15Yeah! I like him.
05,15Funny that, since I don't like metal.
Is anything going to be streaming later?
05,15DocSane and they all fall into the category of terrible
Fror instance, the shockers can be gore, porn or simply more rife with emotion than category two
Hue Hue Hue.
there a stream?
no
MLD doesn't deserve to be a title of a category
BWAHAHAHAHA!!! :D
05,15Didn't he do ponies too?
The Tunak Tunak one was actually kinda diappointing.
he did
gut really, most fanfics are a combination of two or more categories
OH THAT REMINDS ME.
05,15I feel alone in my hate for fanfics :(
Pfft, l2Flash.
there are some that are interesting
I'm 'sposed to be drawing.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph5ZfxQQ0As
like I enjoy Background Pony
probably because you havent read the right ones yet
you can't beat that
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko-qsjfEcRM&list=UUg3WNGww9ZJC-V8KE9wvM3A&index=3&feature=plcp
i regret writing mine
I actually felt it was someTHIng pinkie might do
I don't really read fanfics because it takes away my view of the canon show
well, at least the second half of yugioh and the ep
Really, none of them flashed at all.
05,15hell no
good
Besides, I main Fate, I can teleport long distance.
The only fanfic I'm looking forward to re-reading is Progress. I hate to think that it's unfinished :(
seeing fanon destroyed by canon makes me laugh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdgbwC6bGTI
you probably get bursted before that
Arrow 18 Mission Logs: Lone Ranger. Probably the only realistic "Human in Equestria" fic ever written-- and sheer brilliance.
05,15Like when Luna wasn't a sheltered invalid
Best destruction of fanon was Luna's protrayal in LE.
plus it was pretty fn
There's a very good reason for that
Well I wasn't there for that
care to explain?
AHAHAAH
I disagree. Canon Luna was a very subtle mixing of many interperetations of Luna.
HAHAHAHAhAH
ADfldqsanjfkiwsNJGFV
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
05,15DocSane wasn't it glorious?
