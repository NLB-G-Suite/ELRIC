You know what guys? The reason why Yu-Gi-Oh was in the lotto because MrBen just threw it in as a joke because he didn't think he'd ever win
SOMEONE PUT ON GHOST NAPPA

Egon is best Ghostbuster.

I was discharged after my CO found out who I was from Celestia. I was homeless for the longest time after that, until the Apple family took me in during the early part of Ponyville. Eventually, I made enough money to build a home. Then I built Ponyvi
otakon: i guess.
You said it too me smartass.
welp i think imma go play some RE4
When I was little I watched Digimon
ASoftFluffyThing: no MrBen for selection YGO: PoL
what are the kicks for now?
otakon: |In fact he's never even seen the movie either
Meanwhile: *to
"Do you believe in magic?
IKR?
OohShiny: I watched that...
I watched Digimon on Youtube.
maybe
J_E_Smith71: THE FUCK!? WHY WOULD HE PICK IT THEN?!
Meanwhile I said it to fluttercry dumbass
otakon, oh. I thought you were talking about the kickbots
in a younng girls heart?
WHERE ARE YOU MRBEN!?
The Japanese version though.
whats magic he says it but what is it?
maybe SirGanjalf|Buster
otakon, My mistaaake ._.
digimon
05,15what was said to me?
hello every pony
Wirisme they were made so we cam make fun of otakon and his short messages
I head that movie was baaaad
SirGanjalf|Buster: In a young girl's heart
The_Murky_One: Maybe. But it didn't have a full comedy cast. This movie had Ivan Reitman directing and a full cast of SNL/Second City veterans. It easily could have been just another summer blockbuster. But the writing and tone make it easily believable as a horror or action movie. But it is still a comedy at heart
I WANT TO STRANGLE YOU YOU GODDAMN TROLLING BASTARD!
digimon, now there's a nostalgia trip
MrBen is the new Simon
hi streamer, you misses a whole lot
otakon: Again he didn't think it'd win so he just threw something in the lotto for the hell of it
Oh hey you're right, I'm sorry Ish it was T.
>:3
hey digimon hey digimon
lol
J_E_Smith71: YOU DON'T DO THAT!

So, I can post my usual Yugioh card pictures and not be off topic?
monster friends to the boys and girls
OMG I used to love this song

otakon: i guess, although a lot of stretchyt animation too i think
when I saw this I was reminded of UHF
Her voice is so amazing...
otakon wait, what?
Step on the dovahkin symbol!
AJ doesn't have the fancy mathematics
Or they're all mammals except the eagle
Huh, never noticed Daring's voice was not RD's voice...
rats eat cockaroaches...
RD is good at voice acting
Twilight cannot be the closest friend to herself.
I would've thought they're all mamals except the bird.
DocSane: sure she can
whatever language that is word for no
if that sweat had fallen into another board and activated the traps
Future twilight is closest
DocSane: Nvm, got what you said. Probably Pinkie PIe.
Lunar_Brony: the animation in this ep is awesome PLUS there is a grain filter effect for the DD sequences which is ALSO awesome
dadada
AlienWarhead: They're in ... odd, out of the way places. But there ARE four of each before the extras in the DLC.
UHF!!!!
Who said ponies can't play hopscotch?
I assumed she would speak in RD's voice, as this is all technically all taking place in her head.
Si
cowvarkian Well I haven't seen it yet
And then interruption...
anti climactic climax
spanish word for no
oh just gran it

KALIIIIIIIIIII MA!

This show is a spoof of a spoof of a movie?
Gold_Demona: PICK AP DE PHONE, INFIDEL

TheDarkFreak: I mean, that really got out of hand fast.
spoofception?
:)
I'm back people who haven't been talking since I left!
YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE FORBIDDEN TREASURE!
I just noticed ^^
did you know that if you stay that near to lava, you die from the temperature?
otakon: :D
YOU HAVE TOUCHED THE FORBIDDEN TREASURE!!!

pinkiepancake: Heh
AlienWarhead: Yeah, Spoiling some of them didn't actually make me feel too stupid, but it does seem that Extreme exploration is the only thing rewarded, NV can be really really cruel to the player.
Technically, yes, he has indeed gotten away with it. :P

Whoever is streaming needs to play the "Reading Rainbow" theme song after the episode ends.
Thank you for embiggening our vocabulary. :D
Dear Princess Celestia: I hate them all. Spike
DEAR PRINCESS CELESTIA: I didn't learn anything
This is a funny episode with a sadly anvilicious moral.
Sorry RD, Reading is for smar- *gets glared at* ...man I was JK :(
spike can destroy an entire town if he wants too

The Powerpuff Girls movie. Well, that's going to be interesting.
^
PPG seriously ?
Did you see that goaltender that cut his neck get by someones skate he was bleeding all over the ice?
lol and RAWRity wasnt kciked
so one really DRY movie
*kicked
00,10btw dont make me lock out nick changes
and then one fairly funny movie
00,10movie on to ponies
it evens out I guess
It had lots of monkeys.
Inb4 pony eps are Lesson Zero and Sonic Rainboom.
srsly, PPG is fucking awesome.
yes it is
that's why I want to see Hotel Transylvania
13lesson zero isn't eligible
05,15bleh...next week
lol that's a well constructed sentence right there
13it's out of the list
like, it's one of the best Super Hero movies I've ever seen. No joke.
it's got Genndy Tartakovsky directing it
Inb4 pony eps are Luna Eclipsed and Sonic Rainboom.
I want to support his work
00,10Number 94 Tovler with zomg finaly "Dragon quest"
My choice was first on the list bra
unlike goddamn CN with their stupid bullshit
Dragon Quest. Meh.
Ha, Dragon Ques
No, but that sounds quite nasty...
Woah, been a long time since that's been here.
otakon: i want to too, but I'm not going to see Hotel Transylvania because fuck Adam Sandler
WHY YOU FUCKERS CANCEL SYBIONIC TITAN?
we need some Cider love
00,10not sence we showed it live
otakon: low toy sales
RAWRity: but THERE WERE NO TOYS
otakon: there were. and they didn't sell.
that's why Fuck CN in that case
So they'd be really really low, huh?
00,10and finaly number 110 KaitoThePony with "sonic rainboom"
HAH
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Good to see we'll be getting every episode instead of the gosh darn same few...
OF COURSE
SONIC RAINBOOM
00,10glad we wont be seeing that one for a long time
that reminds me, any news on the season 3 premiere yet?
Yep.
0,5God damnit
you wanna see it?
11,01I picked Sonic Rainboom this week.
IshBlueEyesWhitePony: november. that's all we know
No.
Fucking called it.
Meanwhile can see the future
so an underaired ep, and an overaired ep. brilliant
haha ok
00,10You fail
And even still with the new measures in place, we get Sonic Rainboom.
0,5My aunt brought my little cousins over unannounced and I missed god damn half of ghgostbusters!
but it was suppossed to be this or last month :(
hey, at least it's not Zero or Luna.
Best to get it out of the way, I suppose.
True.
00,10looks like that is it for the lotto. Supprisingly easy today.
Rainboom is like the second least aired most aired ep.
Bleh. Still seen it too many times. :/
11,01BaconMane: At least you don't have to clean gutter out tomorrow likely during EBMN.
Where was Gondor when SONIC RAINBOOM. AGAIN?
Someone in the comments said the surgeon who operated on his neck said he was 20 seconds away from dying :o
Where was Gondor when Meanwhile fucking called Sonic Rainboom
Whoo hoo! Two of my most favorite movies of all time!
My Little Rainbow Dash, and some other ponies.
0,5:/
YESH
0,5What movie is up next?
what movies were picked?
I think I should have been more specific with my A movie
I can SPEAK!!!
Yu-Gi-Oh
PPG movie@
Curses, foiled again!
Yu Gi OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH.
*plays Secret of the Magic Crystals whilst watching stream*
Pyramid of Light
but sonic rainboom is terrible
owl, evryone is fond of owls
and thus we end the repetitive votes with sonic rainboom, for the last time
Well it's the final time in the episode cycle we'll be seeing that
13what time is it
inb4 WMC n7umbah 3
Whats B movie again dearies?
Sumi you fail
ahh not liking any of that
05,15Have no fear. Sonic Rainboom is now out for months
with onions
:P
PPG movie
Dken2021: At least till next year
but yeah, King's Speech is a snoozer, PPG movie is awesome, Dragon Quest is one of the best eps of Season 2, and Sonic Rainboom is a thing that happened.
It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-duel!
this is a dark day indeed
fwiw I completely forgot Dragon quest was a thing.
Huttah!
9:22 is dueling time
ofc
Dragon quest is not on my favourites
00,10at least till some time next year fluttercry
I AM SO GLAD DRAGON QUEST FINALLY WON
well, i'm off. enjoy the card game anime
Sumica:so is mlp the movie gonna stream? you know the old g3 or g2 movie i dont know which generation it was but will you stream it?
http://derpy.me/DZPMh i'm ready
Fell asleep before A, I'll catch the Eurostream. As always.
Don'tcha wish someone else had finished that referance so you could not scowl?
I never win anything so Now i will die! Bye!
LOL THAT PICTURE CAME ON AT THE PERFECT TIME
bye
fluttercry as much as I like the ep, I'm glad I won't have to watch it here every second week
.-.
wat
oh god!!!
seriously, only about two to three episodes of season 2 ever play
Ok off for a bit will be back ummm when we're done over here ;)
and terror
The first few months of BMN I won the B movie choice 3 times, and never since then. I smell a conspiracy!
Sumica: Is there somthing wrong with the stream audio? The intermission sounds crackerly
can't wait to watch the Power puff girls next week:)
I wonder if Jackass 3 will ever be on here
Sonic Rainboom's a good episode though, even if it's overplayed
Sumica fluttercry: What's the ETA for when we're done with the current ep cycle? I tried to count and it'll probably be March. Maybe first week of April when all the eps and Season3 will be available again
I just want to win once.
Anyone else got crackerly audio?
me
anyone know what this song medely is
http://iambrony.steeph.tp-radio.de/mlp/gif/pinkieblastof.gif My reaction on this weeks Lottery
Spazturtle: I do
KaitoThePony . . . remind me to request that
Don't ya wish your girlfriend was hot like me
Spazturtle: It might be the song, not the stream audio in general.
05,15Something like 6 months
me too
05,15not sure though
BAAD MUK
oh we're back?
Lunar_Brony: I do everytime
CrimsonPhoenix: Nice movie choice.

Should be a great movie.
I got picked :D go RD!
XD
Meanwhile http://derpy.me/DZPMh
worth it
god i fell like im playing portal
it looked interesting
so much
Lord smoothies
fluttercry if there are 52 episodes, then that means 26 BMN's will be played until Sonic Rainboom is eligible. That's about 6 1/2 months
I bet I can tell what that is without looking.
fluttercry you were close
so Meanwhile admits trixie is his gf.
Okay so
good to know.
05,15Thank you for calculating that for me
np
I do not. Shaddup.
Lunar_Brony, that is until seasons 3 starts
Today I met a brony at work and hoofbumped and pony-geeked with them X3
Is the chat out of silent mode now?
No, 26 weeks is about 6 months.
Guess so. :3
CrimsonPhoenix: http://imgur.com/ZPBzx i swear. it's not what it looks like
Kurra: nice. :)
DERPY
Oh Derpy...
Kurra excellent
from season 3 it will be more than 6 months
Just as 52 weeks is about 1 year
Inb4 that one screen cap.

I cant watch next week anyway, so i'll hope for mine next time
XDDDDDDDDDDDD

Gold_Demona: Nope, we're all mods now. >_>
0 bronies here :(
taoumi, that's.....interesing

yesterday I was dragged into the most brony0friendly hot topic I've ever been in. The staff were friendly. :)
Maybe I counted wrong
no motorcycles, so no.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Awesome! =D
lol..
CrimsonPhoenix I haven't been around long enough to know how BMN and the new episodes work together, so I can't really say anything for or against that
Card games in pyramids.
trying to do a little clean up CrimsonPhoenix :3
wait no motorcycles ?
does anyone else eat everything w/ chopsticks?
Lunar_Brony Objection we never have Season 2 episode 25 or 26 during movie nights so the episode number is 50 here

I've heard that the next movie is poop. I already have a hard time for anime in general, so maybe this would not be the best way to try to change my mind... Perhaps I should sit this one out.
behold! no one gives a fuck
Becuase they don't have card games on motorcycles children are filling that void with crappy beiber and twilight, only a few dollars a month can spare the life of a children by giving him card games on motorcycles

enter setto kyba
No it doe
Sumica so, that means we're going to have a total of 65 in the rotation, which would bump the re-stream eligibility of Sonic Rainboom to approx. 8 months, but that also depends on how you're going to handle having an odd number of pony episodes. Either way, we won't see Sonic Rainboom until July.
wait, what?
Um, yes it does.
It doesnt!
Long ago, egyptians activated each others trap cards

Everyone is ded.

Anubis. What a-nub.....us
I know what she means
Currently drinking some.
Zombie
Purple`Prose they don't
She sees dead people
Burned myself.
her skirt is too long
Anubis IS A GOD YOU IDIOTS
But Anubis wasn't real.
IT'S ALIIIIIIIIIIVE
05,15and then the abandoned the plot as soon as they picked it up
My tongue feels funny now.
Imhotep?
Skills.
eye sockets are so not circular.
I've sneezed a couple times, but mostly it's just soreness. Anyway, I'm certain I'll know if I'm coming down with something later.
He got lost
Anubis had a jackal's head, right?
No, I came to STEAL IT
Too bad we're not great minds
Hes only here seeing things thats older than him
Was the stupid hair ever explained?
EEEyup
...eeyup
Yeah we know how this will end. Yugi gets in a long ass fight with Kabia at the end, Kaiba almost beats Yugi with his new uber cards, something happens out of left field and Yugi beats him
No, I came here to see TOM.
Or was it Set?
Hey, I'm stating the obvious..........AGAIN!
SirGanjalf|Buster: Yup.
Meanwhile and Grandpa is Meowth

Now you're just making stuff up.

Hello Plot Point..... Not that you pervs :|
Evil sorcerors who try to destroy the world? Never heard that story before

Also, hey Adjeca!
05,15Egyptology actually is legit
No one ever plays just normal card games in this show do they
SirGanjalf|Buster: Anubus Jackel head yes
An evil teacup?
Did anyone play the PS1 yu-gi-oh game?
05,15sounds stupid but it's totally real
That shit was hard
I would just take it easy and get a good sleep I guess
I'm loving this movie too, in a "god i'm getting injected directly with awesome" way
That's no knife. THIS is a knife.
My brain just stopped
Meanwhile actually no, I looked it up
Oh~
No comment on the fact that it was solved.
oh right, missed the coffin
fluttercry: who says it isnt?
Oh come oooooon.
And yeah adjeca I wanna see please :p

Grandpa has pretty biker fashion sense :o
GODS DON'T DIE
I haven't read far enough in the script to know what to think
OK, join the Villains-who-go- little-to-no-screen-time Club (Venom, Darth Maul, and Bobba Fett)
I'm pretty sure that wasn't a part of Egyptian legend.
Legends are always just legends
RosePetal: TOON WORLD WILL LIVE
AJIsAwesome|Busy: this movie is over 9000 in levels of high camp AND melodrama
silly grampa, legends are 100% true
yes and totally ignore the fact the both window crashed
since when are any of the legends in this show wrong?
Look, everybody who dies wants to think they'll come back.
YOU FAIL MYTHOLOGY FOREVER
OohShiny: They do in Egypt.
Yugi, are we the same age?
also WHAT IS WITH THE OVER DRAMATIC MUSIC?
OohShiny: they only sleep
05,15Shut up Mokuba

The Shiny Mokuba
Mokuba!
IT's 4kids.

otakon: IKR?! :S
otakon blame 4kids sound score
not only is Kaiba Brock, but he's also Meta Knight (in the cartoon)
Shut up Mokuba
Implying he hasn't lost it already.
WHere's my pokeball?
MY MOM YEAH
Dat hair.
GAME
I'd say Egyptian mythology was completely fucked up, but, seriously, what mythology isn't?
He never had it.
The dude obsesses over Blue Eyes White Dragon. He's not really sane.
otakon: blame......you know 4KIDS
That's no limo
Eat my dust you losers
cowvarkian I have a book labelled "Egyptology". It's about Ancient Egypt and everything about it: a citizen's life style, their spiritual beliefs, medicine, farming, etc . . .
ugh
You knows you sucks a dueling ? MY MOM
Oh, hey it's the Teenage Rhino and his pal again!
GET IT
Triston's voice no longer gives him super strength
WAIT
:I
FART JOKE
Egyptian mythology had gay inest between gods.
eww
yugi. wat r u doin. yugi. stahp.
Drive into the sunset.
CAUSE THAT'S FUNNY
DId he just say that he farted? :S
really, did they seriously just make a fart joke
>_< This is bad comedy
...Really...
Purple`Prose: That's explained, actually.
Eeyup.
MrBen: okay now that I've accepted this as high camp/melodrama I can take it at it's silliness level.
Is this a movie or episode?
4kids is bad at making jokes
Lol wut?
-.-
05,15His voice makes me sad
CrimsonPhoenix kid'll love it!
no kidding
CrimsonPhoenix: IT'S BLOODY HILARIOUS LEL
FUS_RO_yay: Movie.
FUS_RO_yay: 90 minute movie
FUS_RO_yay: movie
FUS_RO_yay . . . yes
Tristan's voice returned in a heart-wrenching moment of tearjerking.
Toliet humor the lowest of low.www
FUS_RO_yay: It's the movie
thank god it's nearly over
ok I change my mind, wmc this
OH GOD AWESOME
A FART JOKE..........we got a FART JOKE in this movie. THIS IS CLICHE...........THIS IS YOUR A**
Ah. Thanks for the 5 answers.
Top floor, must be a long movie to make it to the final bos-... never mind
MASTERS of comedy
Flashback.
At least this is only a 90 minute movie.
how long....
Sciaenops: Incest between ancient gods is in fact nothing that unusual
Lunar_Brony: ok... didn't I ask who disputed it? not "I dispute egyptology"?
Yugi must get such a ribcracking if he ever falls on his face.
We're already...what...halfway through?
YOU DON'T SAY
That's an hour.
RosePetal2: Worst of all it wasn't even 'good' toilet humor. That was about as lazy as you could possibly get.
But when they have hawk heads and dog heads, it's kinda strange.
MrBen: eeyup
dat voice
split personality?
what the fuck is going on
but I'm sure card games are the answer
Wirisme: no idea
This movie is only good because of Dan Green
MURDER
crazy
bashful: that's his tulpa
Red, Yellow, and Blue, Just like the primary colors in art class
DAT DAN GREEN
amnesia as the plot calls
True, toliet humor is usually lazy.
cowvarkian . . . what does "dispute" mean?
NOW KISS
05,15Because Pharoh's looked like that
Wirisme: CARD GAMES
CrimsonPhoenix: WHO is Dan Green?
And now Atem
YU GI OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
CARD GAMES!
Don't they go back in time n the series?
YUGIOOOOOOOOOH
YUGIOHH
Lunar_Brony: say doesnt exist
Purple`Prose: In the final arc of the story, when the ancient Egypt stuff happens, it's explained that Kaiba is obsessed with the Blue Eyes because the Blue Eyes represents a girl he had the hots for, basically. Egypt is fucking weird like that.
O_O
he turns into his tulpa!
Sciaenops: Yeah, must be incest and zoophilia then, ugh
However Dan Green is good. Because he's Dan Green.
otakon, he voice Yami Yugi
seriously DO THEY HAVE TO SAY THAT?
YU GI OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
TIME TO DUEEELLLLLLL WOOOOO
OohShiny: oh god lol.
CrimsonPhoenix mmhmm
Sailor Moon has a hotter transfomation sequence

KAIBA STOP STALKING THAT TEENAGER AND HARRASING HIM WITH CARD GAMES
That doesn't look safe
I got a used copy so no card for me.
fluttercry: Pft, you dork. Kaiba's here, WMC is impossible.
Purple`Prose pfft, saftely
I really doubt this movie is bad because of 4kids. Let's face it, the concept is awful.
this is the biggest fun I've had in any BMN ever
4kids' background music is too noisy and overwrought
Oh trust me Pegasus is fun.
vagineer, any movie would be better without 4kids

No joke Yugi
Yep, Kaiba's gone nugging futs.

Great. The building has had the oxygen cut off
Hey at least they arent breaking the Floatation ring to win xD

Yes, i do want my coat back
Just rip the damn card in half, and crash the game.

OJ safety hazard altogether, but this IS Yu Gi Oh . . .
he dies
05,15Do they just there?
personal AND personalized jet?
Spazturtle: Maybe, but I can't imagine the original is good. In fact it may be even more insane, chopping off legs with buzzsaws over card games...
check
fluttercry: The plot doesn't advance.
and then there's a duel for the rest of the movie
fluttercry yes
fluttercry: one can not just not duel
fluttercry: Hours of awkward silence.

I summon fluttershy! She has over 9000 Cute Points!
:O
Nittany_Discord: I haven't watched a single episode in years. Neither the old or new serieseseses.
agreed!
Nittany_Discord the show itself is really good actually.
ACTION LINES WHEN THEY DRAW, OMFG SHIT'S HEATING UP NOW
NO, If you attack Familar Knight, his effect will
you dont have to attack
there aint no breaks in the duel school
Gotta love how Kaiba has the financial ability to create a > Card deck reader that can jsut take a shuffled deck and read it > computer that analyzes all possible duel outcomes in a game that relies half on luck > a swanky lab to do it all in > a badass goddamn longcoat.
Screw the rules, he has money
fluttercry: totally my point
Queen's knight me gusta.

That's MESSED UP.

all three at once
oh man

What about Ra's massive summoning chant?

Kaiba, you fail at strategy
My bed looks so inviting right now...

DocSane: yes
DocSane: They did, and I have one lol
HAHAHAHAHA.
"I'm sure on your planet that counts as some semblance of strategy..."
yeah
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Yugioh card monsters are based in different categories, such as Beast, Warrior, etc;
that's like saying: hey, nice bazooka you got there, but imma force you to bring out your TANK and you BOMBER TOO! WHATCHA DO NOW, HUH???
Main bus A undervolt.... we have a main bus B undervolt....
Yeah, Exodia sort of became meaningless when season 2 happened.
DocSane yup, and all cosplayers rejoice
but you auto win if you summon him
how?
Prepare to get ......uh.... get owned Kaiba :$
DocSane: Yes, yes they did. No holograms unfortunately. :(
I summon!!! A BETTER MOVIE!!
DocSane: Yes, actually. Not sure how well they worked though

The rest of the movie, is pretty much this:
FORGOT WHAT WAS ON MY CLIPBOARD
NOTHING
SOME GUY MADE A CARD BASED ON IT!
*note: you can't do this effect what's shown in the movie
BUT
It's a trading card as well :O

And then it does something other than just stopping the gods
WELCOME TO THE SHADOW REALM
Wtf is going on?
You know, there's one core flaw in Kaiba's strategy. He believes that by preventing Yugi from using the gods, he can defeat Yugi. The problem? YUGI ALREADY BEAT HIM IN THE PAST WITHOUT THE GODS.

why people think Yugi is the greatest duelist ever JUST BECAUSE OF THE GOD CARDS? Maybe the narrator from before forgot to mention that Yugi defeated Kaiba became King Of Games, by defeating none other than Pegasus to save his Grandpa! AND WITHOUT THE GODDAMN GOD CARDS! Yeah, forgot to tell us that, you jackass!

Neutron blast.

The fact that he ALWAYS summons this dragon is suspicious. LIKE CHEATS
05,15seriously

Scoot-Scootaloo: SCREW THE RULES HE HAS MONEY

KIDS LOVE THAT SHIT
fluttercry: exactly it's a 90 minute game advertisement
PYRAMID BRAWL!
Kiba summon a lvl 12 monster in 2 turns....this game is broken as shit
fluttercry, the TV show is 30 minutes of yelling at holograms
otakon: Heh. Hey, your opinion is your opinion. I can honestly respect that.
Sciaenops remember, he screws the rules
GET UP ON THE HYDRA'S BACK
twilight_sprinkle: "And that's not even my final form!"
SAURON!
Eww they're mating
DerpyMuffins: The original game was broken as hell. >_>
90 minutes of holograms and butchering Egyptian mythology.
There making out

MrBen: inb4 you win B movie again :D
Dken2021, *bows* thank you, thank you... :D
MrBen: Well you can't vote B for four weeks anyway
Anubis was a dog-headed death god, NOT a sorcerer.
SO he's VENOM?
Makes total sense>_>
Fair enough. Frieza wears lipstick.
11,01And mistakenly thought all anime was like that.
why, got a small one you wanna wear?
Sciaenops this is a world where life-or-death situations hang in the balance of a card game.
J_E_Smith71: Didn't think so.

CrimsonPhoenix: but I like B movies...
Ive got a big atari collection, getting a jacket would be awesome

So will this be the third movie to get blacklisted
But only if I can actually wear it
that's better
This is getting really out of character
for all the times you have won faitrly

Kaiba is such a pussy
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=280988661183
Oh no, he did not just diss the heart of the cards.
This is a J movie

Shit, that's kawaii.

Ok fluttercry I am seriously thinking of turning off my chat so I can at least attempt to enjoy the movie
Dark Magician, I thought he was a sexy beast when I was a wee little girl.
fluttercry: Actually, the game's rules instruct you to announce your actions as you perform them. Seriously.
SO DARK AND EDGY
I got dat card
Sumica . . . damn spittake
Nice hat.
05,15The only thing worse than this would be a Magic The Gathering movie
OJ: now

All of these illegal moves
The fuck is up with his hat?
OJ: you're thinking with portals

fluttercry: ideeeeaaassss

fluttercry: What about a movie about pong?
6_9
Nah, Magic the Gathering, that would be chill and not all shouty like this movie.
cause Magic the gathering is a better card game
Turns out...you still suck.
fluttercry, don't tempt them. Then again I think there's a DnD movie, so....
STILL.
fluttercry is MTG as complicated as this?
OohShiny: I think the movie has affected my ability to think.

NOW YOU'RE THINKING WITH PORTALS
CELESTIAL BLAST! :D

And now Kaiba's like "Okay, fine, I'll quit."
even celestia can't save that movie
Celetia's morning breath!
Thank you for explaining the obvious.
Sorcerer of Dark Magic prevents traps from activating. Which is why Yugi never uses it
now they are drawing cards mid turn
Madness?! THIS IS YUGIOH!
05,15MTG is complicated as hell, and one time I went to a birthday party where all they did was play Magic and made me watch

this is as worse as explaining pokemon to an adult in the 90s
The Shining Dragon looks like typical final boss material
200 HP left
we should watch a dbz movie, this will look like a brilliant move
oh shit 200
Aw =(
this is NOT cheating. THIS is using effective strategy
In a world where grown men play with cards....
OH god only 30???/

I figured since winter is coming up, it might be cool to wear
....hey Yugi...you alright?
Buytoast, in the shows it goes on for 5 episodes sometimes
and what happens if he doesn't get up?
he isn't dead though
oh i know
Dark92Enigma ah, ok
Buytoast: This fight would have filled a standard episode
he has 200 life points left
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Every next card is more OP than previous one!
but seeing it drawn out like this
this is the worst thing I have seen in a long time..
it's more painful
"Yugi? Yugi, it's your turn! GET UP YOU IDIOT!"
indeed, i like it
Lunar_Brony I know, but we all want him to be dead,

red_ony: You don't watch many movies then

RANDOM YU GI OH TRIVIA: the true effect Pyramid of Light actually allows you to special summon "Andro Sphinx" and "Sphinx Teleia" fromyour deck, but only by paying 500 life points for each summon. If "Pyramid of Light" is removed from the field while "Andro Shpinx" and "Sphinx Teleia" are in play, destroy and remove both cards from play.

00,10a new bus? but the old bus was just fine
Scoot-Scootaloo an ancient power has risen and allowed the "Game" of Yu Gi Oh is real. Because he used them already, and they were destroyed. It makes more sense if you play the game. Don't ask how, it just does.
05,15I'm asking
...........................................
Because Shining Dragon was the main advertising card for the movie
pony_666: Because they wouldn't kill this monster. :P
YESSSS YESSSSS
DO HO HO
05these mosnters are SUICIDAL
lol
You want a real monsta,Just give the Loch Ness Monsta Tree Fiddy
pony_666, because this card needs more screen time to sell
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Iunno lol. That insect person threw them off a boat or something.
So he lost to Blue Eyes Fabulous Dragon twice in the space of five minutes.
dat looked like a pokemon fight

As far as movies go, this isn’t the worst, but it’s down right dissapointing. The animation is amazing, but the plot is a complete mess, the dialogue is cliché, and it NEVER SHUTS THE FUCK UP!

1/10 WMC only because there's a chance it could be picked again for B movie. This movie is so fucking noisy. Knowing what all the cards did didn't help the movie for me.
dis soundtrack.
Und dann rap number.
And the manga. . .was surprisingly dark.

05,15If everyone could go to #Vinyl_Scratch and vote on WMC, that'd be awesome. Voting will be open one minute
Shizuka: it's hard to see them past Megan Fox's ass
Bayformers does one thing majoryly wrong
that bad
Nah Shizu, if you look really closely, there are robots.
Where was Gondor when WMC was in effect?
Where was Gondor when WMC time?
Only the dead can know peace from these cardgames.
all today too o.o
13are you sure
one thing?
-∞/10
BUT IT'S DISSAPOINTING
Best Movie Ever Clause? It gets replayed every movie night?
fluttercry, seriously?
ONE THING?
They're pretty cool too!
it doesn't focus on the namesake of the goddamn title
er, 30
Gold_Demona: Which further proves it was more of an advertisement than a movie.
WMC?
WMC? Wut?
13i've watched it many times and i'm not sure there were robots in it
You should try watching it again. On mute.
fluttercry, you have to be joking.
Wrek, seems like 40 seconds.
A LOT of people had a lot of fun in this
It does nearly everything wrong
It's still FRIDAY NIGHT
Thulu-tan: okay not one thing but the MAJOR thing
0/∞
Well, I'm off to play some Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit before bed. Bye yall, its been fun!
XAX the game itself, as i recall, CAN be fun
05,15say what you are voting. yes or no.
DEFINITE not WMC
You were probably sulking when the robots appeared.
fluttercry: If it's WMC will it still be shown tomorrow?
Yeah, don't WMC this. It was funny
its still friday yaaa
no.
its purly to try to revive the dead show
WMC = worst movie clause
Shizuka: can we get THIS movie WMC'd please?
To WMC this movie would be BEYOND just biased, it'd be downright stupid.
Is WMC because it could be picked again a good reason for WMC?
currently on the front page of Reddit, that's where i saw it
otakon pay attention to mane.
otakon: no
what is wmc?
NO on WMC.
nah,it's terrible but not babes in toyland terrible
Kinixys, Barbetos: We had four cals for WMC already.
no
13Meanwhile, I'm not going to put up with you much longer, so you either behave and start being respectful, or you can have a time out for a week.
Sexy Magician Cards/10
If this movie gets the WMC I'm going to push so, so hard for a D-Wars WMC.
IT's Crummy, standard, but it's still fun to watch, and easy to make fun of
OKAY
Yay MLP episode!
No WMC
Pony Time again
FOR THOSE WHO WANT WMC
YES PONIES :D
Seriously, it was literally just announced that it was in for voting on WMC
POST WMC AFTER ME!

the origional was about Yugi killing people
EF YEAH PONIES
:D yay

NO WMC
Yay! Ponies!
nah, it was very, very, VERY bad, but somewhat enjoyable
It was stupid, but it held my interest well enough

First pony I saw was Rainbow Dash
80s dance time
:$
And i don't even watch that anime!
00,10guys he said go to #Vinyl_Scratch
I wouldn't say it's WMC material, it was fun to poke at the loose plot and dialogue
ugh
My brain is working again!
Showing more respect would imply I have any for you, and frankly I don't. Frankly I was hoping you'd try and stream yesterday so I could've rubbed it in then.
that makes pinkie alternate best pony
Lunar_Brony, at least it won't be replayed for another 6 month now
unwatchable Reikim
You know I dont remember you asking this Adjeca, have you played through the skylanders game yet?
Be prepared for the epic song
that pinky
derp
Yeah no, sorry, that movie doesn't deserve it. If The Last Airbender isn't WMC, this movie doesn't deserve it. Period. >_>
The first pony I saw was Berry_Punch
Exactly.
WMC.

00,10go to #Vinyl_Scratch to vote yes or no on WMC for yugimovie
we need to watch After Last Season, without the rifftrax of spoony spiraling into insanity.
Meanwhile: that doesn't matter, WHY are you giving Shizuka such goddamn grief?
Yes Pinkie Pie, wash away the stain of the stupid...
You returned that big screen tv and never bought a replacement?
I think Meanwhile has a crush and this is his version of pulling pigtails
Lunar_Brony: never get tired of that either

otakon: Because I'm bored of pretentiousness. And I'm also bored of you and your impossible-to-resist urge to leap the defense of boobs.
bow ties are cool
05,15looks like the answer is no
Reikim: this is not a matter of me protecting anyone this is a matter why Connor is being an insufferable prick

otakon has a massive white knighting issue. Meanwhile's a prick. We've known this for a while. Now we're going to shut up about it, because talking about things that everyone already knows about is a known form of Lacking Intelligence. Talk about the weather or something if you want to be like that, at least we've got geographical differences in that area.

silly Cranky, you can't outrun pinkie

Pinkie's all over the map
THERE IS NO ESCAPE

Love the eye bit actually
Instant address Book

Leave me alone to masturbate in silence.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: YOUR eye is creepy!
Reikim: what am I missing? Meanwhile was acting as a dick proclaiming shit that in the time I've known Shizuka is untrue HOW THE FUCK CAN I FUCKING LET THAT SLIDE?
ACTIVATE MATILDA THE LOST MAIDEN
pinkie is a happy slenderman when she pinkamena she's slenderman

I like you lot, but most of you are just out of it.
oh realy
SHOVE.
pony_9001
I'm almost suprised...
they could make a Pinkie Pie: THe Eight Pages
Have you ever been so angry the room tilts?
Push n shove
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh my god, how did we watch a 2 hour Yugioh movie without one 'you've just activated my trap card' reference?! (unless I just missed it).
It's effect permits me to lower Cranky's defense to 0
And you think that throwing a fit about it will fix it?
Butterflies = cherry blossoms on this show.
CrimsonPhoenix: Quick! Use reverse the reverse card!
OVER NINE THOUSAAAAAAND
otakon nope
Johnny Brave Hair activated
And yes, I have.
No, but I've been on a boat before.

666...
DERPDERPDERPDERP, I actually did
I have to calm down
You see? She accepts that he doesn't want to be her friend. If the episode ended here it'd be a poignant lesson learned. The happy ending is just there because it's a lightweight show. And that's fine by me.
twice
how does she have 8 legs?
75 DAYS
I don't feel so well
05,15Yes. everyone needs to
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Someone linked an image, other than that we did fall down on that.
and then EQD got the paper
Lol THAT'S SOME FANCY MATHEMATICS
Pinkie's an six-hooved mutant
Woah, Pinkie really has beatiful mind.
That'd be a great idea.
now we know your birthday Pinkie
05,15RAWRity bring more bunnies
DERPDERPDERPDERP: how did you not see the dozen trap card links?
2 and 2 and 2 and 2and2and2and2and2and2and2and2
And I've learned that sometimes the best way to deal with it is to sit down, shut up, comfortable in the knowledge that you know what is right from wrong, and move the fuck on with life.
Pinkie's good at infinite sums.
J_E_Smith71: nah shes Spider-Mare! :D
Pinkie winks... She knows... Oh my god"
Wait for the Sonic Pinkboom
that very old movie
that fucking gala
Which, otakon, it would behoove you to learn to do.
SirGanjalf|Buster: So unlike mine at times.
CrimsonPhoenix: Good to hear someone was on top of that.
pony_666 Because Pinkie Pie logic
that's not 80's ponies
aww:'(
Wonderful place top put the note
Donkeys don't dress for the gala, I see.
flutterchy: that's 40s for you
That's poignant
Reikim: the day I do that is the day I stop living.rolling over like that...
It's awesome how they include these different styles.
anyway moving on
You're not rolling over.

Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that the best way to deal with gods, be they Lovecraftian Sumerian deities or would-be Egyptian lords of the dead, is to CHEAT YOUR ASS OFF! CHEAT CHEAT CHEATY CHEAT! Your faithful student, Purple Prose.

Reikim: what are you counting?
Is is night for everypony because I feel odd.
How long until it carries on again.
I'm counting bunnies.
Woah S3 is in November?
Jeez, this deja vu.
All I can think of is this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP7k-3Tipp4&feature=player_detailpage#t=459s
pony_9000: Magic shows are great!
Sumica: thanks for the stream man
Bunnies.
Or bunnies, that works too.
*giggles at Dark92Enigma* :)
KISSmyCUPCAKE: It's night here.
er
one sec
13taoumi: if ponies are similar to dry erase boards, you can scribble hard over permanent marker with dry erase and it'll come off
yep
05,15My friend has a bunny. It bit me the first time I saw it
I think we were up to ....
better a late start in Season 3 than a huge drought for Season 4
5?
It's official folks, Season 3's in november, you can stop spoiling now.
ohai Shizuka
Hey guys remember this? http://derpy.me/mINw5
FOur.
hi Sumica
*Four
fluttercry bit him back ? bunnies taste good
Hello Shizuka.
I just counted.
Well better late than never
Four bunnies.
Gutted flutters. I like rabbits, they're strange little things.
Shizuka: ..... sure but what about the fur geting in the way
bro hoof to every pony nite
Hi Shizuka
And one awful pony t-shirt.
05,15I wouldn't have minded rabbit stu.
how so might I ask?
g'night pony_9000
i've had rabbit stew
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Ja23HfhY&feature=related
it was pretty good actually
My friend is becoming a Legend of Zelda fan/ fapper... November better get its butt over here now.....
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/video/niconico/sm17317029
Stew is evidence of God.
Night, pony_9000. :)
also Deer i like deer
13hm
a little too much pepper in that batch though
05,15why did I spell it stu
13washing maybe
Deer is better than rabbit.
I LOVE Deer Chops
05,15I'm tired ;__;
fat and all
Take any meat and stew it long enough, and it will become impossible to identify the source of the meat.
Good stuff
fluttercry: If you hadn't mentioned that we'd have assumed it was intentional.
lowfn, Zelda is a good choice
better than Peach at least
Any meat becomes beef/chicken/pork with stewing.
lol
Shizuka: i tryed bleach for a good bit. didn't do anything :(
I love stew too
13:<
13dunno then :/
bleaching an animal?
05,15It's a joke I've had with my mom that we'd get a rabbit and name him Stu. Guess I just slipped up

what's with the styrofoam horse
Fun Fact: The show Doctor Who is considered and by technical definition, a religion
it's not it's a blank
ty
13ohhhhh
13fabric
Buytoast: looks like a plushie form
lowfn: I heard about that.
Shizuka: it's a form isn't it?
13thought you meant a little plastic one
But that rabbit will lose control of his life...
np
05,15What kind of stain are we trying to get out of what item?
13or foam
BANG BANG http://derpy.me/mINw5
at 4 in the morning
it would be awesome, that the sceane in RE0 where Wesker and birkin are watching a TV moniter, it was edited so they were watching ponies. Just a weird thought.
At 4am in the mornin-damnit.

13well, white foam, could try whiteout
wat?
oh yeah
xD not so simple Shizuka
13X3
the Rugrats ep
XD
05,15But he can make me chocolate pudding
it is a plusie blank
sonicdude558 LoLz
fluttercry is Angelica.
Im confused
never ran into this problem because i've never done a white one before
I'll be right back you guys, switching from my new laptop to my computer.
Resident Evil Zero was terrible though
13contrary to popular belief i'm not much of an arts and crafts mare... never had the money or the space for it
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: are those catgirl controllers on the right?
05,15Is Stu making pudding still a meme or did that die out?
05,15I liked the Gurren Lagann one
Also, lag happens.
Buytoast: the REmake was awesome however
05,15REmake was great
I think it's something that's referenced every now and then.
otakon the right one it a xbox one the other is not a controller as far as i can tell
Not really meme-worthy anymore.
Once in a blue moon.
Im sure the old school fans at the MLP arena have tons of tips for pony ars and crafts and customizing toys, they have been at it since the 80s after all.
ah
Remake of what?
fluttercry: dead
05,15RE6 is....wat. The reviews, from players and critics alike are all over the place
dead as Jobs
Could you do what you needed to do tomarrow if you wanted to do it yesterday at the same time while your doing it today?
dead as Duncan
dead as Carlin
Dead as otakon's sex life.
there is a wii one
Meanwhile: it was never alive to begin with... :P
ASoftFluffyThing: a think they are talkin about Resident Evil Zero and its remake
Ohhh
*i
back from watching Animal Crossing videos
05,15It's always sad to see a meme die.
Touché. And props for rolling with that one, I was expecting caps.
05,15Guile's Theme was my introduction to ponies
I love the old school RE games, new school games starting with RE4 should have went stelth survival rather than action schooters, if you ask me.
ok looks like my best bet it to soak it in rubing achoholl.
wb Tovler
Memes dying? Sad?
I was sadder when Hitler died.
The universe cheers every time a meme dies.
In the meantime, caption this http://i45.tinypic.com/281zk7c.png
Resident Evil 6? Oh, you mean Rooty tooty Call of Duty Zombies map Special Bonus Unlock?
Arrow To The Knee wasn't sad.
Meanwhile: I can come back every once in a great while. It's like a falling star blink and you'll miss it.
05,15Let me rephrase that. Good ones that were actually fun
because that's what resident evil is now you know
Ninjazz: Damn knee, war wound's acting up. From Borderlands 2.
05,15Arrow to the Knee was forced and only got popular because of the idiots that played Skyrim.
But they all stagnate before they die.
They're like flowers.
Buytoast: lol yes
otakon, OOOOOHHHHH NOOOOOO.
Pretty for a while then they end up in compost.
Buytoast: I honestly want to try it out though
i used to be a meme like you but then i i took and arrow to the knee
05,15The number of people I know that think memes come from memebase is sadly too high
Ninjazz: oh yes
God....damnit.
05,15Also, waaaaaaaaay too many people like Tosh.O
Just get resident Evil 5 and imagine you get to play as six people now instead of just two
Ninjazz: Borderlands 2 is a fun damn game filled to the BRIM with nods, references and easter eggs.
Still no stream? Or should I refresh?
almost got past the first few minutes of the Animal Crossing movie without crying nostalgia tears.
05,15COOL STORY BRO
Buytoast: you can't move and shoot at the same time for one.
otakon, I've been playing it a bit, but haven't seen much, or any at all. But THAT is kinda disappointing.
stream over? was away
05,15I hate how one of the characters yells that every 40th kill
Tosh.O ?
Buytoast: two you can't take control of a monster and shomp someone online either
Borderlands 2. Aka Borderlands 1.
So guys, I want to go to Bronycon this year, if I can graduate out of my training program or get a few days off I can make it. How does one get a ticket to this thing?
http://youtu.be/3tH60cNil1g
Feels weird not hearing Moves Like Jagger
Dark_Horst, it's over for now.
ASoftFluffyThing: no, no stream...but Scoots said SB was doing the aftershow lol
A terrible comedy show on Comedy Central.
05,15Zer0 says "Hillarious, you've activiated my trap card"
NocturnalBlade, okay
Rex_Mundi, stay tuned....
Do any of them dance Gangnam Style?
05,15TheGreatAndPowerfulT imagine if that guy who reposts 5 year old videos and memes had a TV show
05,15that's him
Ninjazz: it gets better when you get further on, once you hit Sanctuary it starts to hit it's stride
As Celestia's Sun rises on Ponyville 2 figures stand on the edge of a forest, one a small dragon shaped one with spikes runnning up its back the other a taller 4 legged pony shaped figure with a horn coming from its head. One of the fgiures speaks “Twilight why are we up so early? I wanna go back to bed.” The shorter figure Moans. The taller figure, Twilight answers “I know its early Spike but we cant let anypony kno
Rex_Mundi: You can usually purchase them online or at the door, I think.
Bronycon is starting its own reg system, and the details of it are yet to be... revealed I think
It's best playing with friends however
meh
05,15Meanwhile not yet, but I expect DLC with that
http://youtu.be/i7v5wDVDpnc
I don't think I've seen a OG ref in it
yet
Got it cracked and most people I know sleep when I'm on, otakon. :/
tl;dr
what's with the fanfics
Twisted Fate from League of Legends is getting an updated model, and a new dance with it. Guess what dance it is.
Ninjazz: you're fault, play when they are online
OH
I heard TOR is F2P now
God, please. No badly-written fanfics.
otakon, can't. >_<
05,15Dammit, society is trying to make me hate Gangnam Style
/me plays Rayman Origins :)
Well that didn't take long.
05i think i managed to config my joystick not to be so glitchy
you see all that Rex Mundi? But it's proably going to be some 'pay $40 or something and pre-reg your con badge' on the con website.
fluttercry: I saw it on Kelly in the Morning the other day
actually, i think i've read this, and i think i get's erotic
Though frankly I'm surprised ToR didn't trip out of the gate and break it's teeth.
05,15It was on the Ellen show the other day too
05,15ToR it pretty much did
it cant be erotic or read before i just wrote it
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Nice. How do you like it? :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UvEgxpDcvM
Heard Gangnam Style in a workplace radio yesterday.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ebha1NW5t0
dont mind me
ever had a Bston Cream Pie that warm and fresh from the oven, with the chocolate oozing off and thee custard is warm? I'm having one now and it is delicious.
btw dis is the song that rolls out in my head when playing medic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH4D7Uod4Cg
Frankly, it's making me feel like a hipster.
ah, no wonder. it looks like pretty much every other story written by every other person
Lunar_Brony: Sounds really good.
just thouGHT i'd let you know
Even Korea thinks it's overrated as hell.
Meanwhile: well apparently it's now the best single player MMO on the market according to a guy called the Rageaholic from Youtube, you'd like him man he's nearly as cynical as you are in his reviews
Cypresswolf: :D
Lunar_Brony... o-oh.. my. ~///~
dam n keyboard
can't type with one hand
I got another October surprise for Everypony :)
otakon: The best single player MMO. If you want to play by yourself, why're you playing MMO's.
?
lol
05,15Someone at my school tried to post Dwight photos on a YOLO sign on one of the bulletin boards, fucked it up so bad that now I have to put up a "That post gave me cancer" and "You're meme is bad" photot
OH yeah?
o.o?
that's the joke
05,15Idiots
If I ever wrote a pony fic, it would be about one of them coming to THIS world for a damn change.
Lunar_Brony: 0_O LOL
anyway gonna go check if it IS F2P
brb
Your.
Is it a nice surprise?
DocSane: What a tweest!
00,02NullRadix, Ping
05,15fuck
lol
05,15Now my meme is bad
hi Phase4
Phase4: pong
Cypresswolf, say it cx
05,15it's a never ending cycle
dat Phase4
WHAT?
Forever bad.
busy being an idiot of sorts
And it would end with the pony telling the human to stop assuming Equestria is some sort of utopian paradise and remind them that monsters wander out of the woods every other week.
05,15But yeah, if you're going to post a meme to mock yolo, don't screw it up.
There is a boat in the harbor i sail out of named YOLO
Bobby Bare "Marie Laveau" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpZzehuWdM4
05,15SINK IT
written in COMIC FUCKING SANS :/
...
DocSane I'm writing a (hopefully) non-cliche HiE.
05,15LOL all aboard the S.S. Troll
DocSane just to prove such fics exist
See, I don't like HiE stories because they all end up feeling the same.
And i'm back, just switched to my computer.
DocSane: That sounds more like G1 ponyverse than G4, I hope G4 starts to get a little more dangerous like G1 was. Just a little less slice of life and a little more adventures.
U jelly of his boat.
If I knew anything about video mixing, I'd make a Zecora pmv out of that
Lunar_Brony, if it's about a hater visiting equestria then let me tell you it's already been done
slice of life, topped with whipped danger.
CrimsonPhoenix far from it
dammit
so emma watson doing 50 shades of grey movie, what about that ?
it's still not F2P
05,15wat
rule of fanfiction: everythings been done, everything is cliche, mary sue, OOC
:P
not everything has been done.
05,15Emma Watson in a movie about kinky bondage.......
i knew i would get at least a wat
Sex with the CMC. It's ALL been done.
fluttercry: and she'll be NAKED
not by any stretch of any imagination! :D
DocSane: :S
The sex stories usually done first, sadly.
05,15NOOOOOOOOOO
lol
DocSane, that's eww x.x
where is that button?
im sold
Didn't they also get Justin Bieber for that movie adaptation?
otakon she does not even have the role, she want to
05,15OH GOD
Stream still ded... :( We didn't even have any move like Jagger :'(
Kurra: Yeah, that was my reaction when I realized what I was reading, too.
05,15Justin Bieber X Emma Watson
http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
Spectrum_Rush: What about a fanfic, where when Luna was sent to the moon, she wasnt on the surface, but was really trapped in the darkness in her head with only her thoughts. The fanfic follows her thoughts.
richfiles, yeah you're right
what gives
Xp
use as needed
05,15so many conflicted people
fluttercry the sound of weeping men across the globe will be heard.
05yeah this is much better
Rex_Mundi: been done
05now i can actualyl steer
everyone you should all aknlowegde that i started this conversation
and some women.
Well do you really want to see Bieber spanking Watson with a riding crop?
Steer?
o/~ Another man done gone.... o/~
wait is fifty shades of gray about lesbians ?
05,15Sounds like a bad fanfic
T: Lol'd.
Rex_Mundi: Problem is that she was trapped as Nightmare Moon, not Luna, so it'd mainly be a lot of "I can't wait to get back and make them all pay!"
05,15so...like a regular fanfic
05configurign my joystick so i can pilot better in planetside
Oh.
05,15There is one that is about, I shit you not, Goku and FUCKING ANNE FRANK
You mean you don't know it was a Twilight (YES THAT ABOMINATION) fanfic?
"Configuring my joystick"
has Wrek drawn anything recently?
We don't actually know if eternal night was really what Nightmare wanted
I would like to see a fanfic that goes against most of the fanon facts
13http://i.imgur.com/3Pqsi.png
Please, Goku x Anne Frank is OTP.
After all, history is written by the victors
I'm going to say yes, since that's what Tirak wanted in the original pilot, and Mare in the Moon is basically a remake of it.
Cranberry_Scotch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3Rj2uLPgk
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaa

here have awesome metal head playing awesome weeaboo songs in metal http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88tNh76Iz-8
Shizuka, I really liek your mane in that pic :3
http://youtu.be/E2Rx1YHfibg
Meanwhile: What crap again?
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Eh, use your imagination.
05,15oh it's that guy that does everything metal....I think
For all we know, she may have just wanted to extend the night for a few hours originally, Celestia over reacts and in the process of sealing her, gives her the idea of eternal night
All G4 fans should check out that First G1 MLP special, in my opinion.
yep
E331Rock?
Meanwhile: I like the fact that you added a moustache
05hahaha
05im not dying!
05,15Yeah! I like him.
Spectrum_Rush: I actually didn't, that pic was sent to me by someone else.
For me, MLP fanfics break down into three general categories: those that try to be like normal episodes, those that drip with emotion, and those that try and shock the reader.
05,15Funny that, since I don't like metal.
Me too. He did Kingdom Hearts, Dr. Who, and some I've never thought could be heard in metal form.
05,15Except for 80s metal. That was the best stuff
well props to that guy then Meanwhile
In a nutshell, Average Episode, My Little Dashie, and Cupcakes.
And each one can further be broken down
Spectrum_Rush: Ikr.
Is anything going to be streaming later?
05,15DocSane and they all fall into the category of terrible
Agreed Rex... Excape from Midnight Castle is a MUST SEE for all MLP fans. It really lays some foundations for what eventually develops into G4! :)
Fror instance, the shockers can be gore, porn or simply more rife with emotion than category two
Ralin: yea, i think SB is gonna do something
DocSane, can you please rename your emotional category?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0deA1JUUZFQ and then mordekaiser
CrimsonPhoenix: Why?
Thanks NocturnalBlade.
05,15I see he did Tunak Tunak Tun. I know what I'm watching next
no prob Ralin
It's too emotional for Crimson! :D
Hue Hue Hue.
there a stream?
no
CrimsonPhoenix: It's the quintessential heavy emotion MLP fanfic.
MLD doesn't deserve to be a title of a category
BWAHAHAHAHA!!! :D
Huehuehue indeed. You'll never escape Nidalee. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9O0WIoSmFI
so guise in my story twiligt sporkle mets spoke out front of castle canterolot and themns a tree kidnapps fluttershy so ahow many chapets shoul i make it 7 oor 15?
05,15Didn't he do ponies too?
The Tunak Tunak one was actually kinda diappointing.
he did
gut really, most fanfics are a combination of two or more categories
fluttercry, eyup.
Check out this fangame, its not in english but just listen to ponyville music. http://d.hatena.ne.jp/video/niconico/sm17317029
CrimsonPhoenix: I refuse to read it. Like Cupcakes, I only know of it via osmosis.
OH THAT REMINDS ME.
I think... I think that was the first MLP thing I watched on YouTube.
still nothing more awesome than jarvan Meanwhile
what ASoftFluffyThing ?
05,15I feel alone in my hate for fanfics :(
Pfft, l2Flash.
fluttercry: You're not. I kind of despise them, too.
there are some that are interesting
I'm 'sposed to be drawing.
dont cry, fluttercry!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph5ZfxQQ0As
like I enjoy Background Pony
probably because you havent read the right ones yet
I own TWO copies of Fallout Equestra In hardcover print! Twily would be proud of my epic pony war books! :)
you can't beat that
I reAD cupcakes, it wasn't that shocking
ASoftFluffyThing: oooo, what ya drawin?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko-qsjfEcRM&list=UUg3WNGww9ZJC-V8KE9wvM3A&index=3&feature=plcp
i regret writing mine
DocSane: So... where does a story like Arrow 18 fit in there? Because it really doesn't.
I actually felt it was someTHIng pinkie might do
I don't really read fanfics because it takes away my view of the canon show
i found cupcakes mildly amusing
NocturnalBlade, a picture
fluttercry: Fanfic can be the worst sort of masturbation, and anything you like can be undone by the actual show making a new episode.
i should've done something better with my time
welp, fucking internet made me miss everything
Kencolt: Not familiar with it.
ASoftFluffyThing: -_- why am i not surprised by that answer from you
05,15That why I LOVE when the show destroys fanon
well, at least the second half of yugioh and the ep
fluttercry, me too
Really, none of them flashed at all.
so did yugioh get WMCd?
05,15hell no
it's always funny to see people get so butthurt when their precious fanon is oblitereated
good
oh those delicious reaction when Vinyl showed her iris
Besides, I main Fate, I can teleport long distance.
The only fanfic I'm looking forward to re-reading is Progress. I hate to think that it's unfinished :(
seeing fanon destroyed by canon makes me laugh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdgbwC6bGTI
you probably get bursted before that
Arrow 18 Mission Logs: Lone Ranger. Probably the only realistic "Human in Equestria" fic ever written-- and sheer brilliance.
05,15Like when Luna wasn't a sheltered invalid
The show can either destroy fanon, like with Cupcakes, or embrace fanon, like with Derpy
compared to dbz movies yugioh was a piece of art anyway
Best destruction of fanon was Luna's protrayal in LE.
B-B-BUT HER EYES ARE RED. FUCKING HASBRO
plus it was pretty fn
DocSane: I agree
DocSane, really?
There's a very good reason for that
Well I wasn't there for that
Buytoast: It was just the shadow, her eyes are really bright red
care to explain?
AHAHAAH
fluttercry: I thank god that was not true
Suddenly, all those sad widdle woona drawings of her in a cardboard box magically vanished.
True tbh, but maybe they'll be too busy beating on Amumu.
Rex_Mundi, HA
keep yourself in denial there sonny
HAHAHAHAhAH
ADfldqsanjfkiwsNJGFV
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
05,15DocSane wasn't it glorious?
