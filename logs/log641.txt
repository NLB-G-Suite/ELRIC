I hope this time as homage to the first time it got shown sumi pauses it every five seconds.
chin, frizzy, space jock
It's him! The man! The BAT man!
i'm canadian too!
I really wish I understood what's going on in the film right now, but it's just colours at the momet.-
*yay
/me is reminded of Lego batman
....meanwhile, in MORIA
AH YEAHH THE FINAL SHOWDOWN!
huge building
moment.'
I'm a potato
Gandalf_the_Brony :D

this is such a dark movie
00,10bat drunk
I'm food topping!
CK|GW2: They have a cave troll.
....wat
I can't see what's happening
Art streaming time. Damnit..
Domjnoes
bat derp
04Yay, dominos
that retractable barrel
I should be asleep.
Gun barrels don't do that
NO I'M PATRICK
I remember in Lego Batman that the final level was in the church. This inspired i.
Ah well
No I'm not, i'm a chicken!
fluttercry: yeah and what the HELL do they eat on a desert planet?
BACAAAAAAW
pew pew pew
batman is almost dying
DSNesmith: still better than Batman Returns' lighting.
05,15You know what Tim Burton should make? A movie of the video game Medievil
DOmino!
05,15That's right up his alley
YOUR A TOWEL!
Batman pushing down a set of benches. How uncouth.
Domino pews
fluttercry: MEDIEVIL!
Meanwhile: It's as I feared....
fluttercry: oh god yes
fluttercry: i agreee
Domino benches
fluttercry: oh nice, somepony besides me who remembers that game
Medievil? is that teh game with that stupid skeleton head guy?
04Uncouth, fancy word yer usin' here in BronyState
her shoe!
fluttercry how about tim burton doing a version of the crow
FOOL OF A TOOK
Medievil fucking rules
cinderella
Dat shoe.
Antz was a good movie, I guess. Maybe.
05,15Buytoast yup
Follow the shoes
Ghosties: UNCOUTH? *burp!*
wow, how long have they been climbing
dat reference
I hated it
Throw yourself next time to rid us of your stupidity!
Ghosties pfft, fanceh
as a kid
Uncouth? BRAAAAP! Ex-actly!
I like how he has to lean back to look up
those bells would be loud as hell
next time throw yourself down
I don't really remember it.
pony_300: about 3 minutes
> Finds shoe > Doesn't pick it up to smell it
Finally the police arrive!
fluttercry totally fitting!
hello everypony
Dusty: Fool of a Joker!
Fuck you nruce
Look out, it's the pack of health!
bruce*
the same stupid skeleton head guy that is shitting up super playstation smash brothers?
But I remember the singing.
Oh hi, Freefall29.
wtf tom
er, Shitaku?
13i don't remember it either... not beyond it wanted to be "a bug's life" and the dreamworks face
all I remember was the pillbug scene
WELL, IT'S ABOUT FUCKING TIME
CreativePonyName: Don't judge me ;-;
scarred me as a youth
Buytoast: that is DANIEL FORTESQUE! HE IS A GODDAMN HERO!
dat soundtrack
Oh no.. what will they do?
Rape
Buytoast: I'm wrong, SIR Daniel Fortescue!
joker just HHHAADD SSEEXXX AND IT FELT SOOOO GOOD
NO. not that.
Shizuka: actually, it was pretty dissimilar to A Bug's Life.
SIR Daniel Fortesque
I blame that and the spiders from the Hobbit cartoon for my bug phobia
oh snap
ewwww pee
uh oh
Tomlpchan: to be honest id do the same thing rofl
going down!
00,10DING
05,15ah yes, the dreamworks face. I remember not caring about that movie at all
Buytoast: no he's not...unless they made him shitty
otakon your arguing with buytoast you allready lose
Oh no, his flower peed on the bell!
Dumb Bell
Ooops!
BIG BELL.
I think if Antz is the one I'm thinking of...did they have a bit where their soldiers are destroyed by beetles or something and then the dudes severed head talks for a while?
phew
CreativePonyName: \o/
we need to get Beauty and the Beast up in this bitch
yes
05,15and also I seem to remember disliking A Bug's Life
that was an awesome movie
You missed.
Dammit Graham
He whizzed on the electric fence!
i dunno, i'v e only heard good thing about him
GONG
get out of the way
beauty and the beast that is
blocked
That was a sweet bell.
Oh great now they can't follow him.
/me digs out medievil
but it's Shitaku so anything they report is automatically garbage
Oh no, that will take at least five minutes to clear away!
for one, it was a good deal darker, was more a Woody Allen movie than a kids film, and was just focused on the ants.
beauty and the beast is good for one reason, and one reason only
Joker saves Batman from the incomming pack of health.
SWEETIE BELLE, NOOOO!!!!!!
gaston
oh yeah push it
DocSane: A sweetie belle?
and now everyone is deaf
you didn't like A Bug's Life?
beauty and the beast is indeed a great film.
13a bug's life doesn't quite stack up against toy story or monsters inc
If BatB plays chat will be nothing but "Nobody x's like Gaston" all night.
DocSane:S
Welp, here we go with those incompetent cops again.
00,10oh no the bell is slightly blocking the path
Sweetie Belles fine.
Meanwhile: yes, that's the one.
"All right boys. Nothing more we can do here, let's go home."
A Sweet bell pepper?
oh shit Freefall29 be in chat
SWEETIE BELLE!!!!! :'(
well it's goddamn Seven Samurai with bugs
Buytoast, or late
:D
Everlasting_Joy: xD
Shizuka: toys story is best pony
Freefall29: agreed
01,11It's only a model.
oh yeah, one fat, middle-aged man is going to move a two ton bell.
Sumica: It'll take them, like, five minutes tops to clear that path. Lazy shits.
:S : I'm not dead
Silverscreen: shhh
dem lights
lol searchlights.
that cgi
/me puts otakon in a box
Toy Story 3 is one of the most moving films I've ever watched
those lights looked fake
I think my fave pixar flick is wall-e
00,10or just climb over it CK|GW2
05,15I think my favorite movie from childhood was Finding Nemo
Bat yayman
Where are they?!
/me breaks out of the box
05,15I cried
Meanwhile: and Ish will change his name to "IshFastLikeGaston"
01,11This scene seems vaguely familiar....
I had the bugs life tie in game on PS1. Hated it.
Toy Story 3 was prett good.
pony_300: Early CGI.
Buytoast please go back to 4chan
partly because I'm a sci-fi nut but also the first half was fantastic
/me bonks otakon with a wooden mallet
otakon: toy story 3 was great... but didn't hold the awesomes 1-2 had
final battle
prett*
puns
man
pretty*
Sweetie Belle is broken. Dead sounds too harsh.
wat
Wheeeeerrrreeee aaaaarrrrrrreeeeee yyyyyoooooouuuu
3 was the best one
Suddenly Quasimodo shows up and belts Joker over the head with a tire iron
13fluttercry: Dory at the buoy at the end
i seem to just anger you everytime i talk
omg
Freefall29: are you kiddin? it was the penultimate movie
Aj: Really? Interesting
ninja

>finding nemo >childhood
ninja man!
lol what.

Where did they come from?!
Well ok.
Shizuka: a'wwwwwwwwww
CK|GW2: XDDD
Acrobatics
I guess because of the nostalgia factor, i've seen toy story 1-2 sooo many times
Silverscreen The upcoming quote, perhaps?
ninja joker!

And here... we... go!
DSNesmith: I don't really know. I was half asleep when I watched it.

that music
like a boss
Oh noes Joker is dancing.
OK LOLWUT?
brb I think pizza is here
I was the only 18 year old there
05,15But it was a happy cry. Because I'm super close to my father and it made me feel nice
dat waltz
Freefall29: nostalgia should never be used as a factor in judging a movie
13the ending of cars with lightning pushing the king to the finish usually gets me too
epic fail
Dat theme song.
was trying not to cry into my hands and failing
Joker, y u so silleh?

BWAHAHAHAHA!
04LOL
Mario underwater music?

MY BAD
Tovler: I though of that before
even Batman is like WAT

boombox is the best character in this movie
Tovler: You heard it too?
The fail is strong in this one
Tovler: almost XD
fail
although it is funny to see you cry and whine everytime i try to have a conversation/opinion there Quick Thinking
fai
and joker with his swag
then it was just "we gonna crush your heart now"
DAT FAIL. :D
04*jumps at Batman* HAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH! *falls through floor behind him* AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!
I'm not sure I liked the previous films as a kid.
I liked Nemo, but it was more funny than emotionally stimulating.
So this is where Hasbro took their inspiration for the Derpy scene
we need to watch Alladin up in this bitch
Bronysith: I never said it was bad, but, I just feel it wasnt as good at 1 or 2
And Batman's kill count is now, what?
LOL.
Shizuka: meh, I never particularly liked Cars. and then of course Cars 2 kind of killed Pixar's credibility
pixar was handing out feels at the end there
MORTAL BALLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
We've had Aladdin.
Ghosties: :D lmao
I think.
cars was... okay
I think it was that kid with the weird toys who put me off Toy Story.
cars 2 I didn't bother watching
13Up's problem was getting the trademark Pixar Heartbreaker out of the way in the first ten minutes
Meanwhile: we need to stream it up in htis bitch anyways
Batman:12892348902189732189074
thousands of people died at the hands of the joker, I laughed at their deaths
Ghosties: lol
I'm going to hell
up just felt so pointless
hi everypony what are we watching?
CAN'T UNHEAR MARIO
BANG

lol you idiot.
00,10black guy dies last
LAWL
13haven't seen cars 2.. haven't heard much good about it either
not the flying house, the bird hunter guy
05,15Yeah, Cars and Up were the first Pixar movies that I didn't jump to see
Meanwhile: you get bored of everything aniki
Bat fail
Dusty: He doesn't kill people, except the large number of people he's killed so far
Flash plug in crashed.
incredibles was great
Joker: We're just like Beauty and the Beast. But if anyone calls you beast I'd rip their lungs out
XD
and needs a sequel
True.
that fling
black people
05,15Hell yes
DSNesmith: Yes.
Batman vs Blade the early years
04bop
pawnch
the incredibles, god that was awesome
04bop
04bop
....is that Blade?
I am pretty much bored of life at this point.
THE BLACK GUY (bad or good) DIES LAST
Shizuka: that's what the sequel is for: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6zirsTYdJ1r5zq6ao1_400.jpg
bop
dat punch sound effect
it's a fantastic spy thriller pretending to be an animated superhero movie
05,15TF2 reminds me of The Incredibles
bop
Bop
13incredibles was missing a heartbreaker scene, but made up for it with concentrated awesome
Why is Blade attacking Batman?
I went into Up expecting a grumpy old man, grumpy fom just being old. And then it toned down the movie when i found out Why he was upset.
Black guy does more damage than all the white thugs combined!
joker has the best villains. one falls through the floor, the other hits himself with a bell
Can't remember if that line made into the movie or not
This is some Sockem Boppers shit right here
Bop
Legs.
BONK
00,10he did't kill that guy either

does anybody else feel that monster university won't be as good as monsters inc was.
The Batman kills again

I think the last Joker Minion was Bill Cosby!
Batman's killed a ton of goons in this movie
KILLSTREAK
IT'S OKAY I COULD SEE HIS PARACHUTE!
04That darn gravity
CK|GW2: He didn't kill them, THEY FELL
twas gravity that killed the bat
I actully cried in monsters inc
RAWRity: I laughed
RAWRity: Hahahahaha
13fluttercry: they both draw on the 50s 60s art aesthetic
04Somebody should lock it up
Monster University?
batman just hurricanna'd blade
I 'unno, I can't remember Monsters Inc. either.
oah
Shizuka: My big problem with Up was the villain. He really should have been a character to be respected as something of a hero. By making him a villain like they did it just didn't work
woah?
Except for Bob :(
SAY HELLO TO SWEETIE BELLE FROM ME, MOTHERFUCKER
DERPDERPDERPDERP: So he killed them. :p
Noob709: Wasn't it Danny Glover?
RAWRity: still loled

I didnt really care for Monsters Inc much
dat title drop
lol
so is batman not killing people a new thing or something?
LOL. Best Boyfriend.
Incoming lol
oh hahahaha
>Check google
/me is suffering from Gravity Falls withdrawl.
Joker watched Disney
Ghosties without it, you would have no air to breath and we would all float away
not a title drop its awesome a phrase
RAWRity: mean, but funny
I'm batman
Shiny: ...Samuel Jackson?
>46e anniversary of Star Trek
Personally, I still commend Wall-E as the most daring film Pixar's ever made.
OHHHH MAIIIIIIII
oh mai
i bet joker watches my little pony
ewwww
oh my~
o.o
OH MAAAAAI
oHHHH Myyyyyyyyyyy

wall-e was probably the most risky
PURPLE
RAWrity: definitely
IT BITES!
what about UP?
oh m y

I LOVE PURPLE

I mean, the first half of the film is completely devoid of dialogue.

04WHOA WHOA
Joker is speechless.

And purple. I LOOOOOOVE PURPLE
Oh mai
IT'S A TRAP!

twilight sparkle: good question actually

Right in the bell!
dat horrible line delivery
13wall-e is good but starts boring me to tears if i'm not up for the lack of dialogue

That line still doesn't make sense.
Joker is always purple.
SO MUCH CANTERLOCK
YOU MADE ME
I FUCKING LOVE PURPLE

Dat smile.

00,10she wants his purple headed staff
Shizuka: mhm

13HEY IS THAT PATTY PURPLE
I love it how he can smile.
04Batman doesn't smile, what is this shit?!
PURPLE FUCKING RULES!
05,15I saw Wall-E on HBO at 3 AM one night. I couldn't sleep through the tears

Shizuka i take 20!
dat joke
oooohhhhh OUCH
lol
batman is tough
lol
ouch
hah
For once she didnt scream.
Broke his hand
welcome to the chat Shizuka. I baked a pie today
dem abs
im sorry but joker being the one who killed his parents is lame
see I think we'd be more concerned that batman's about to kill someone if he hadn't already blown up three random henchmen
13wall-e saves the heartbreakers for the trash compactor scene and the kiss
that hurts
Prepare to die
13yay
dun dun dun.
lol
lul
pro
lol
13Dark92Enigma: you can't do that, you rolled a 3!
Dem glasses.
Qhy do people talk about penises and purple? Who's penis is even purple? See a doctor!
How does he even know what he's talkign about?
Yes.
And this is why Joker generally doesn't fight Batman straight up. >_>
he made him first
what about the Plant scene with the big NO?
Heh
This seems one-sided
they made eachother
Alo my name is Amigo Toyota
"Yes, I would."
ded.
yes, yes he would
not ded
how'd he do that
lol
Nope.
wow dat paradox
hax
my name is batman, you killed my parents prepare to die
he would
pfft, glasses
magic
Hipster glasses
Azuredragon, that's one thing I don't like about this movie
win
lol
Hanging around Batman?
it's how they brought Joker in
wat a tweeeest
Shizuka: and of course, the last 10 minutes more or less.
demon
the only thing I think wall-e might have benefited from
LOL GARGOYLE
WWWWWWHAT A TWEEEST
Dusty: lol
13ofc
that line was just awesome
not-deds always get me.
this movie doesnt even try to make sense
was taking out the human characters
lol
DAT GARGOYLE
stomp on their fingers
05,15No, the kiss part was where I lost it. I was holding it in well...then that scene just HAD to happen
You strike me as someone I could probably make cry, fluttercry.
dat hand
wow dumb bitch
I was in denial back in the day, but this batman definitely has no qualms about killing
lol never trust the Joker Vicki.
twilight_sprinkle: What's fun in making sense?
lol
dat troll
You're dumb enough to believe him?! Bat-aMan, drop her!
13the plant and big noooo are more overshadowed by building anger at auto and gopher
Not surprising given the name.
inb4 Frollo falls on top of the Joker.
woooo
ah
OohShiny: its fun to meee :S
He keeps spare hands all around town for hand emergencies
05,15Meanwhile there are about 11 people from middle school that could attest to that
*had
13given it's a small action scene with stuff happening
/me pulls out Meanwhile s nose hair
Joker if you do that, then you will die.
disney was inspired from the frollo scene
Shizuka: I'll go back to the line then :D
I don't think I was awake and/or attentive enough when watching these films to actually cry at them.
/me sniffs.
very few films can make me cry
Quasimodo's gonna pop out of the shadows and deck Joker over the head
twilight_sprinkle make sense? Aww, what fun is there in making sense?
There is his minions.
I mean from this
twilight_sprinkle, making sense how?
Evelasting_Joy: She even has her own kill count for civilians, eh/
13but the trash compactor bit shortly after where everything slows to a halt to deliver, it's more effective there
now would be a great time to use the BATCLAW, maybe?
the only two I can think of are toy story 3 and return of the king
I cry easy....
check that dance swag
Good evening everypony, What movie we watching?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Instrumental Music: Inescapable Encounter / Luna's Song Of The Night / Relax In The Clouds

RotK didn't make me cry
ohai Cypresswolf|BFF
Dovah: Hi! :)
There i tied you up.
Married Life does though
Canadian_Brony: well showing at least how joker fell over the side, then suddenly had two free hands to pull them down, and they didnt see him
Bat_Quick_Thinker: IKR
uh oh
ohai Dovah
What can you seeeeeee
And Joker realizes he doesn't want to be basterdized in the Schumacher films and decides to jump to his death anyway
By the way, you have something on your LIP!
hell just thinking about it makes me a bit teary eye
On the horizoooooon
You idiots stop! The ladder is slipping.
Wall-e is actually a really good case of how to build up emotion in your climax. After all, the only reason we're rushing to get back to earth is because Wall-e is dying. We couldn't give a fuck if the humans return to earth or not.
retarded henchmen, derp

They alive.
wouldn't the whiolash from taht tear his arm off?
the one that's basically scared out of his goddamn mind the entire time
could have done that the entire time
13only thing i remember properly is the beach scene (who doesn't) and the guy with the phone that gets sniped
00,10dat laugh
his arm would fly off

Joker never dies
What a fall.

even in death he's still laughing
04Hey, that's melodic
inb4 he's alive

Private Ryan has the issue or more or less blowing its load in the first 15 minutes with the beach scene.

jokerlol.wav
01,11This part creeped me out.
I'M NOT DEAD
In a comic adapation of this Vicki asked what the Batarang was and Batman said "I guess the media would label it a Batarang"
tus butey kill the beast
WHATS SO FUNNY
and then Joker got eaten by his Hyenas
must have reached termanal velocity
05,15Let me guess. They were like "OOOOOOH SO SWEET"
spooky
04Could make a remix of that laugh
Shizuka: desensitizing via the media
tonight, the comedian was killed...
dat looping wav
13pretty much
da fuck is that
Game Over!
Dat laugh
I may have to convince Barbetos into letting my usurp his computer when he gets here :)
He knew he would die for some weird reason.
Boom!
it's a bomb you fool
OH look it's his laugh box
lol
13raised on call of duty
*when falling to your death, press play*
IT's a bomb!
05,15:( I am Disappoint.
WHY SO SER-----
THE fuck
War doesn't seem to have the effect on people nowadays
He had the last laugh
13some days you just can't get rid of a?
OohShiny YYYYEEEEEAAAHH
otakon: more like Teenagers wanting to be seen as hardcore or cool.
Ghosties make it happen! It will be the new "Put that cookie down!"
For now.........
how coukd he survive that...
that it did back in the 40's
BADUM TSH
hawhaw
Oh that was a bad pun.
...until you're two face
It's a laughing box... but why?
Crime is over...for the next hour or so.
best war movie I've ever seen is BHD
01,11"A laughing matter"
SMILE SMILE SMILE
all of Joker's horses and all of Joker's men...

BHD?
Aww... it should have been a bomb
nooooooope
No longer a laughing matter literally.
black hawk down
DAT PUN
twilight_sprinkle: He didn't, it was a laugh box.
Not yet........
13black hawk down, heard that was pretty good
oh that one
meanwhile in gotham 20something
05,15Black Hawk Down gives me the feels
Joker is alive
04Poor guy
CHUMP
what.
LunarRepublicGuard: It sucks here.
A letter from Batman?
otakon: it does to anybody who actually SEES the war. The people who don't experience it in some way never appreciate how difficult it is, or how hard it is.
GOODBYE KISS
Haven't seen that either.
Never seen that one either :(
DERPDERPDERPDERP: i dont think he dies in this movie
>yfw the theme
Hoorays for Lando.
RAWRity: makes me sad

ShadowQuill: this

Cypresswolf|BFF: You at BFF?
Thus, the Batsignal was born
DUMB GIFT
No he comes back from the grave in Dark Knight.
DATSIGNAL!
/me points at it
EPIC BAT-SIGNAL!E
daaaaa
Meanwhile: :D damnit
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh
*signal
DATBATSIGNAL!
What if it isn't cloudy, sir?
what if there are no clouds?
People aren't desensitized so much as the never had the sense of it to begin with.
AJIsAwesome: yesh :)
twilight_sprinkle: :D
He uh, gave us his phone number
EPIC BAT SIGNAL!
seems legit
how does that even work?
Thus Batman's regin as a hero is born.
Cypresswolf|BFF: How is is there?
Harvey Dent: If evil should ever rise again, I'll be there... with a can of Colt 45.
twilight_sprinkle: You mean for the Dark knight?
it's gotham,it's always cloudy
i hate those CoD brats that think War is kewl
01,11And the first time it was used for real, there wasn't a could in the sky.
Azuredragon talk to the NC.
00,10bad news is we can only call bat man on cludy nights
good thing there's always cloud cover when the bat signal is used.
Batman is always watching
OohShiny: exactly
Azuredragon then they are doomed
ugh
Hi Alfred.
That seems contrived
agreed
When everyone else was watching these movies I was probably on haybales or in a tree.
Was that a boom mike?
AJIsAwesome: Alot of people are showing up :)
Sumica: Classic
poor deluded fools
:D
pony_300: I thought it turned into a Stallion 45
Alfred!
DERPDERPDERPDERP: idk, but afaik he doesnt die like this, unless this movie isnt in the same universe
Now, daggit. Why won't it let me change my name...
05,15I knew a bunch of CoD kids that joined the military after high school.
alfred is best butler
umica lolz
Sumica, its always dark. he will see it
oh dear
I wonder what the turning point of my life was when I started hanging out with nerds.
MIrrister Waayyeen
fluttercry: O_o
Cypresswolf|BFF: Sweet! I'll be there tomorrow! :)
Damn....
That's fine.
Dat yay
Sumica: Good news is, Gotham is always so goddamn dreary that it makes the signal useful 24/7
GETFKED
04So, wouldn't all the bad guy have to do is just destroy each spotlight so that Batman doesn't know what's going on at first?
Don't play NC's Old vs New unless Alister is here.
Meanwhile: when your snark overtook your sense of fun
inb4 end
You've never experienced war in any real capacity, so of course you can't understand its brutality. It's why little kids play war and the like and play with toy guns. For their midns, it's a game. Or rather a competition. This more than predates COD.
13i remember reading an article right around when 2012 came out, about one of the mindsets you should end up in.. that you wouldn't be our heroes narrowly escaping disaster, you'd be one of the thousand little ants getting killed when the freeway collapses or something
inb4 credits
welp, bet that rude awakening in boot was fun for them
The steering wheel is on the right side of the limo.
Tovler: yes
the signals are locked up
inb4 film ends :P
play one round of CoD when they are 15 and think thye can join the marines
01,11Ghosties: that...would make a lot of sense.
And so ends the epic story that is Batman.
Your a genius ghosties
Ghosties comic book universe.
Silverscreen: lol
inb4/10
and guarded by other signals
Discord is best draconequus
BATMAN is all like: i'll just stand here and POSE!
00,10or just crime in the day Ghosties
THEYH DONT KNOW THE EMOTIOANL TRAUMA ONE GOES THROUGH
BATMAN BEGINS
Night!
Hey guys whats we watching?
Moo ^.^
Starship troopers next
Ghosties: Or just light up the sky so he can't see the signal
that was dissapointing tbh
Epic!
Do you?

lets see who gets that reference
ah zombies
GHosties Batman did :p

Bye AJIsAwesome
So fun to watch.
13head to kansas :3
but you have fewer zombies
Hell, if anything, CoD hasn't caused any sort of desensification. More likely, it's the result of people growing up and never experiencing warfare outside of movies and media. They didn't lose any sense of horror, as it was never there to begin with.
Me, I don't have zombie plans.
honestly something I shouldn't hope for happening
05,15I remember we watched Casablanca in my AP History class, and people just bitched about it being black and white and not having any action

Heck, even most of us don't have a real sense of war. We might have an idea about it, but I doubt there are many here who have actually experienced being in a firefight.
05,15Is Batman trying to get me in bed with this music?
MUST MURDER DUMBASSES

Since i saw this movie before, lemme say this: This movie is one of my all time favorites. Tim burton did a damn good job as a director, and it shows in the surroundings,,,,,,sometimes it's the music and enviroment that speaks for itself.......other than that. Batman was good, the Joker was a perfect match for him........it was a solid movie 7.5/10
Not with Trixie the Transvestite Bitch machine

04However
-.-
Snips shouldn't run with scissors
Trixie!
Tovler you know nothing :p
PaladinDrakkenwolf: I can.
Ghosties agreed. Trixie is a stupid fucking bitch who can't tell a very good lie . . . no offense to TheGreatAndPowerfulT
DSNesmith: troll 2
The Great and Powerful Goddess!
Trixie sucks, but her color scheme and mane are awesome.

Shizuka: RIGGED

13don't let anyone tell you we have standards..

Ghosties: I think it was Meg?
PFFFFFFFF aS IF PONY FRIEND

Marie Kanker
i realy wanted twilight to challenge her here :/
Sumica CHANGLING!
n00b
Ghosties: Marie Kanker
I mean, come on, we sat through babes in toyland and epic movie
So, anyone else here pre-ordered the Season 1 set?
twilight here is spike
STFU SPIKE
twilight is hilariously bad, not painfully bad
04Ah, that's it
DSNesmith: bc quality of film is not a definite quantive.
SHUT UP, SPIKE
boy Bat_Quick_Thinker , everytime i talk you get all butthurt
Tbh though, really, take films like that out of the lotto.
boring- pinkie pie
Midnight_Fyre: I would but no monies
04Marie is freaking amazing
No one wants to see that.
SHOW.....OFF!!!!
RAINBOW DASH. RAINBOW DASH
DSNesmith: Auguirre Wrath of god got an 8.1 on imbd and was a B movie
Really.
Ghosties: she was the only one that wasnt hideous
Rainbow Dash being epic INCOMING!!
Thats why
04^
05,15I almost got into a lot of fights. Luckily there was always someone to stop me. It wasn't fun
DSNesmith: dem facial expressions
00,03I do't want anyone thinking I j*ckofftoponies!
#ShowOff
here is an idea how about trixie and chrysalis team up
a beaver?
00,03don't*
Dark92Enigma spike is GAYYYY
Canadian_Brony lol rainbow dash
or lack therof
Scoot-Scootaloo: :S
otakon: Hopefully you can get a job by the time it comes out
"line"
and Pinkie and Fluttershy doesn't get a single line in this episode
"LINE"
We hardly see Pinkie or Fluttershy in this episode...
Scoot-Scootaloo: Too late1
otakon: I knoooooooow
I'll ship Trixie with Malfoy
and
RD is best pony!!
Scoot-Scootaloo: Neeeeight~
Harry the bear
Bitch I took down a Balrog and Ursa Major is a cake-walk for me.
00,10that comes later Scoot-Scootaloo
it had low budget
Here's another dose of my infamy in High School
Scoot-Scootaloo: Who said so?
Hoofington?
no hate on spike
....seems legit
13the theory goes we close lottery on thursdays so we can go through the list and disqualify entries, rather than suck up intermission time
So many opportunities for me to get into fights, every single fucking time i do not
Remember the Columbine shooting?
Tovler his father will hear about it
Trixie MUST return next season
Scoot-Scootaloo then why the buck did you tell us that?
I WISH I HAD
TrixiexMalfoy
i like trixies eye colour
Pinkie would probably pwn trixie
inb4 Destroy Us All!!!
and theyre convinced..... idiots
THE MEEK AND POWERLESS TRIXIE
04Most most most
Its a beaver bear - bears dont have tails that long :)P
SNIPS IS BEST PONY
:P
laserpony approves
Listen to the special needs kid!
Scoot-Scootaloo: this was the art with the..umm...man organ
what, you guys actually choose now?

00,03you guys don't know that poop?
SPIKE... shut up!

Rainbow Dash kicks ass
05,15no no it's still random
MEEK. AND. POWERLESS!
Scoot-Scootaloo: I DOOO~
13we still go by random.org
Scoot-Scootaloo: i do
No, they randomly select, they just clear out the shit.

Oh, lol

It has a 30 Million dollar budget, grossed 300 milliion, and has a middling rating on Rotten Tomatoes
no YOu cant
no you cant
DAT SONG QUOTE
yeah yeah trixie jacking off to ponies
if you just pick the best/worst and disqualify stuff, you can't find hidden gems or hilarious bad movies
we know
what's movie b?
we need that song to play
Well thats good :D
Midnight_Fyre: Silly. Thats not how you spell Black Dynomite
no you can't
southern aristocrat to valley girl. Trixie has such range
yes
05,15What Meanwhile said.
TRIXIE HAD A VOICE CRACK I HEARD IT
Scoot-Scootaloo: Sorry, all I know is Dikeike's version.
and chat starts singing
AH CAN D00 ANYYTHIN BETTER THAN You
OOOOOOOOOH that poop Scoot-Scootaloo
Anything you can do I can do better. I can do anything better than you~
Wirisme: yes i can
Ponyvillians?
Ghosties y so ghostful ?
so yeah, Twilight, as awful as it is, is an A movie.
xNO you can't
13but if, like, lord of the rings is in there, we eliminate it, it's not eligible yet
A southern Trixie? <3_<3

Dusty: yes i can
And suddenly techno starts
"yeah" "oh, okay"
NUD NUD NUD
Wirisme: yes i can
Well, they say they randomly pick, but since they stopped showing the actual process on screen we've only got their word for that.
04I dunno
Try to fly trixie, I dare you, I DOUBLE DARE YOU!
Eye twitching
but disqualifying just for quality
YESSSSSSS I CAAAAAAAN
How about...you!

04Stop making me think of that video
Aj is bestr
05,15We just make sure that the A's are A's and the B's are B's and remove ineligble movies.
Bees my god....
I was making a comment over it to a friend in a private conversation. I was known for having major anger issues in HS, and I said "If I was gonna snap I would have by now, I have access to guns". I got called out of school the next day and taken to the hospital for physciatric evaluation. That I passed as "normal", so it was a free day for me.
yes
spitfirecolt: same here
05,15that way intermission isn't 45 minutes
it can
also i never seens mane or almost anyone making jokes about trixie being a stalion seems weird
Jacqueline Fiona Apple
00,10ikr Ghosties
If it /is/ rigged they aren't about to tell us it is.
she can't do that, she just tied applejack
Notice that Trixie makes no attempt to actually show them up in any way, she just makes fun of them.
LIKE A BOSS
toothpaste mane
Huzzah
HAX!
suddenly SHACKSPHERE
13if it was rigged we would watch atlas shrugged :3
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: bc she's clearly not a stallion
so entrancing
everyone always complained about mods winning anyway
Shizuka: NO
Oh o.k.!
OpticalPie: That's Colgate. :D
OH MAI
Colgate/Minuette/Minty Fresh
otakon original script it was
Shizuka: or lord. That...that fucking movie.
that was stupid
wait thats not how u spell it XD
oh god, i remember when we cycled through 3 intermissions over movie picks
bondage
As I hear it no one likes your movie choices anyway Shizu.
I say the mods should be except for entering
AJ hates bondage
hilarity
13and part 2 is coming... with like an all new cast
colgate
atlas shrugged, oh lord
Appletrix
JUMP AWAY
I didn't see trixie do that
did it have the 6 hour speech
04*guitar riff*
she does it very nice
RAINBOW DASH RAINBOW DASH
RD for win!
RD FTW
13not yet
05,15I still want to read John Galt's speech to see how long it takes.
YES
20% cool
RD!
Shizuka: AS NEVER HAD A GODDAMN SEQUEL IN THE BOOKS!...did it?
RD YEAH
"part 3: the speech"
that ponies a bitch
Dusty: :D
Rainbow Dash is best pony and THIS is why!
yay RD
O.o
05,15Just the speech, not the whole book
20% COOLER
this is awesome
Rainbow Dash ego is so ridiculous
"part 4: the end of the speech"
fluttercry: a long time.
go dashie
Can't say I've ever heard of Atlas Shrugged but general opinion is that it's bad.
GOTTA GO FAST1
13otakon: the book was three parts
fluttercry: Problem is that if our movies are disqualified we won't know about it and will keep picking them only to have them cut out without our knowledge
!*
movies based on books rarely work
a long. fucking. time.
dat cadence
NOICE
"part 5: the end"
Double Rainbow all the way
woahhhhhhhhh
shogipony: You hush.
ego fight
awww yeah
13it's a seriously long book
clap
BEST PONY!
YEAAAHHH
Book? Oh....lol
Remember when RD was awesome and not a jerk?
bu dum tish
Hooray
Ok Trixie how about thumb wrestling? Oh wait you don't thumbs... too bad.
yay
try to fly trixie
EPIC LINE
and then her ego was shattered
Yay
HoodyNinja: oh god she brought her OCs :D
13galt's speech is in part three, we don't know yet how faithful they'll be to it if they get that far
objectivist literature drives me batty
thats my gf
yeah, it's your name, you know?
SPARKLER
05,15Midnight_Fyre the theory is that we would post the list with names removed so you will know
lol
i love this music
They did try to heckle her
TRY TO FLY TRIXIE, I DARE YOU!
rainbow is a noob, rarity is best
except maybe for the extended cuts of LoTR
how does that even work?
Sadly, only Hank Hill called RD loser.
Galt's Speech will be its own movie.
Dat shattered ego
RD isnt That arrogant imo, just a bit overconfident at times
fluttercry: That works
Rainbows are betrying RD
Terry Goodkind is without a doubt the worst fantasy I've ever read
Lets Dash these here Rainbows
derp count
00,10hurrhuur hurr
HoodyNinja: Wait I remember you...
DAT RD PUN
you know. Trixie never does beat any of the other ponies skills
butthurt much?
you spin me right round baby right round
it's like Ayn Rand trying to be Robert Jordan
BAD PUN GAH
but rainbow horse deserves humiliation
PINKIEPIESWEAR GET OFF OF MY HEAD
irony, +20 points!
13that i know of part 2 will cover between the equalization of opportunity bill and the comet crash
she apparently can control the light spectrum... thats prety bad ass
Just 70 minutes of the guy talking
she just makes fools of them
that's all it deserves
ShadowQuill: I dont remember me!
00,03Maybe I have been too hard on Trixie... her puns man, her puns...
I have to admit, that scream of Dash is kind of cute.
and throw in a lot of fetish writing
Hey is lotto tonight or tomorrow?
TUSSSLE
Dusty: enope, she just makes them look bad.
I think I'd deal with Trixie rather than Diamond Tiara
unicorn on unicorn action
05,15I don't like Ayn Rand, so I don't find the idea of reading that book appealing
they totally ignore rarity
inb4 Green Hair
lol
It's worth noting that Trixie never actually out preforms anyof the mane6. All she dose is sabotage the opponent.
Meanwhile: yes
05,15Meanwhile tonight
INB4 Rarity has her JOKER MOMENT..........TRIVIA INCOMING!!!!!
13galt's speech really is dense and out of place, skip to the next chapter to continue the plot
04NEVER Scoots
@otakon Exactly my point
toniiiiight
Thanks.
RARITY IS A THUG!!!!!!!
It is on
IT IS ON!
04Don't let down your guard!
It. Is. ON.
HoodyNinja: WHO AM I?! WHERE IS THIS?! WHAT THE HELL IS EARTH
it is on
That 3rd person speaking
trixie knows where to hiy...
The_Bookworm Yeah we need more Trixie
Shit is now real!
oooh
*hit
Ouch

IT IS ON!
Scoot-Scootaloo http://derpy.me/IZ2Qz
IT. IS. OUT OF BATTERIES
I can't watch this
Meanwhile: YFW i stole your face

Oh shit! it hit the fan
derp
i kind of wanted a rap battle to start out of nowhere from this
SMEXY
Trixie's a whore and I hate her.

This episode pissed me off because she refered to herself in the 3rd persone
The battle of the 3rd persons
Just throwing that out.
*pperson
SWAG
Scoot-Scootaloo her puns wouldn't make it into a Xanth novel
dat man
Rarity should have bitch slapped Trixie
STFU SPIKE
Green Hair!
*mane
That is one of my favorite of Rarity's outfits.
Sigh.
while i have my disagreement's with Rand's politics, my issue trully lies with her amateurish writing.

GASP
I really hate when you're talking.

wow fitting
MIRROR
OH LAWD WHY!?!?

*cue creepy laugh*

Poor Rarity! D:

To be honest, I liked Carrot Top's green mane in this episode. :$
we can actually see a sneak peek of the hair
O_O :O
This is why we need emergency alert system :)
wow...it all makes sense now.
00,10OI WTF IS WRONG WITH GREEN?
Alein!
Carrot Top died her hair green

BEEP BEEP
oni_link: Carrot Top?
Dye your hair, Carrot Top
Spike has green too
00,03pwned~
I might not make the Pixel Podcast Show tomorrow night - I'll be attending the Whooves Line panel & the drinking ponies panel immediatly after
Ryunosuke: Oh my!
fluttercry: that surprises me not at all
DEFCON 2
And then Green Hair was NEVER Seen on Carrot Top again ever again
04Look at it this way, Rarity: If you ever wanted to go to a rave then you know the color to go with ;)
poor carrotop
SHUT UP TRIXIE
Green is not a creative color!
oor carrot top
13yeah i've heard that.. the base is half excited, half not impressed
LAWL!!!!!!!! Carrot Top with green hair?
goddammit purple horse slap her shit what are you doing
The_Bookworm: yep :P

Sumica green is not a crative color
So does Lyra, kinda
i just want to practice my swordplay

BYREE
LYRA]\
brb need more pizza
seriously this looks like a AWESOME setup for a RAP BATTLE why did they not do it XD
take up fencing
Lyra :D
Scoot-Scootaloo: your comments are green! >:I
You don't /have/ swordplay.
I recommend epee
fluttercry: He says he is, but he is just a recycled neoconservative, not a libertarian
Shizuka: which is basically the story of Romney's campaign since day one.
lyra's face is epic
chat derp?
:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:
Spike you make Trixie sound less annoying
Bronysith: get Dishonored coming out soon
DSNesmith: bitch please
Was there ever any doubt~
I never knew Laundry was sentient. :O
Green hair. Blondes-in-chlorine-pool problems.
noticed Pokey Pierce in background
00,10yeah take note of the lower left corner
04@TheGreatAndPowerfulT: That sounds really boring
Laundry is canon
yes
TWILIGHT, IT'S ME, YOUR LAUNDRY
DSNesmith: i use katanas, not rapiers
OR IS IT VICEVERSA?
also, anyone else getting XCOM: UFO Defense come October?

inb4 Snips X Pudding
fluttercry: it's got MP you know
double ninja'd
not the smart foals inn the school are they
you know what everyone should watch? The Mass Effect anime movie that's coming out in november
05,15I did know that
lol
I gotta admit Trixie got a lot of nice quotes
*Snails*
Thank you Grounder
05,15I'm going to fail so hard in it
Hey here is a schematic for you... MY ASS!
Ghosties what sounds boring ?
This is what Trixie has done: manipulated a rope, spun RD around with an illusion, and changed Rarity's mane colour.
well the difference between an epee and a katana is the difference between a sport and a LARPing group
whether it was a good shake or not, I wouldn't want to drink when it was on his rump
01,11I hated these two. They're the reason I didn't mind Pip in the least.
just throwing that out there
why do i get the feeling that they would be kickass at D&D
Meanwhile: wait, like the japanese name or just what the stance is high or low?
You mean the Big Dipper?
Sounds about right.
Green and Powerful?
gettin fked
/me was just bouncing off of your reference
13fair warning, sumica's going to bring the lag back to lagship troopers
Pip is best goat
Dusty: I wouldn't want either of them near my food to be honest.
stop brown nosing Snops and Snacks
Quick_Thinker: Because they're sorta nerdy?
goddammit
I used to practice swordplay.... until i got sick of getting bloodied up by my friend x_x
Huzzah.
OohShiny: Meek and Powerless
So is snails a snail farmer or something
plese no
ohh got it now
Why are they not shocked he a drgon!
Silverscreen They're like Scratch and Grounder
Which means otakon won't be seeing anything at all.
Dusty: Or any horse, for that matter.
you two are stu[pider than mud in a puddle
05,15My school had a fencing club run by the German teacher. I wish I had joined.
RaveBrony: why not kendo?
Snips's hair makes no sense
spike is biggest twilight fan
Applejack wrangled an apple with her tail.
I like pudding :P
>mfw people are using 'swordplay' to describe flailing with metal sticks
she can nowwww
dat pudding
AlienWarhead: No, he's just "slow"
pudding
that's great
PUDDING
Aaaand then I remembered that I have water in the microwave for my tea
INSERT EPCI SAX
pudding
Pudding is gud :)
the GRATE AND POWRFL TRXE
but i like starship troopers ....
noone doesn't not like it
13i suggested just randomly stopping and starting fmle, that introduces like three seconds buffer depending on how much your line is keeping up with mips
POOHDEENG
01,11DERPDERPDERPDERP: Yep
Brb guys, need tea
And I like Muffins
So, did anone else pre-order the Season 1 set today?
35 minutes left - I'm out as soon as this episode is over :) save some power for later
Rarity turned a curtain into a dress.
:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:
no they actually seem like people who play D&D... even though i have played with some uncommon D&D players
PUDDING
GOOD IDEA IN 3, 2, 1!
OK I STAND CORRECTED! Snips and Snails are MORE ANNOYING THAN SPIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!
The_Bookworm: lol
grrrrrrr
YES
:D
why?
otakon: My friend took kendo... I wanted to learn and he would actually cause impact x_x
Rainbow Dash . . . is just awesome.
05,15keep that in here though.
snails and pudding have a good thang going on <3
Silverscreen, then you might approve of their role in Pony Fantasy 6. They take the place of Biggs & Wedge in the beginning.

speaking of martial arts: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3orkn8ORA1rn2llbo1_400.gif
fencing's not a defensive art, that's why i like it
I took Tae Kwon Doe when i was 8.... it wasnt fun at all.... I didnt last 2 weeks :D
it's a sport
surprised they didnt go with the "major problem" pun
ScarecrowGanjalf agrees with ShadowQuill
HoodyNinja: Yeah, would be nice. x3
01,11I actually have a shipping fanfic in mind involving Twilight, Trixie and Hearts and Hooves Day. I might even write it one day.
Crippler true
I can't see her cutie mark
Ghosties depends on your defenition of Hipster
Well thta was strange. I think I had to mcu stuff running at once :$
At least she tries

AJIsAwesome: And that IS GOOD
Silverscreen been done read that
RAWRity: ...shit
I don't like the Trixie toy because her eyes are the wrong shape. They gave her Rarity eyes.
RAWRity: holy fuck
04In your opinion, Canadian_Brony
Yeah

Great. I was playing NES Metroid when I fell into the Pit of Doom in Norfair. Basically, I'm stuck and now I have to die a very slow death.

1,11knock at the door. She's given a letter from a secret admirer and is asked to meet them somewhere outside of Ponyville for Hearts and Hooves day. Twilight goes to find it's Trixie.

13rainbowdash and twilightsparkle aren't communicating very well
inb4 DSNesmith says oops wrong chat
/me talks about Combat Establishment
Bronysith: the difference between you and me is only a few inches
Shizuka: ah
no, no, this is the right chat for that
00,03Second Rule of Fight Club! Don't talk... about.. it....
inb4 otakon is the next wander and he has to slay 16 colossi including me
here, switching networks
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l876il471f1qd8j5mo1_400.jpg
01,11I'm not talking about it.

What are we talking about? Flight club?
Bronysith: you aren't that damn tall
00,03>_>
It's failing. Basically.
00,03Noooo.....

Not B. It sucked, but hell of a budget
no
01,11Day After Tomorrow? That I can talk about.
Not a B
01,11It sucks.
I love this song
Day after tomorrow. Oh, that was alright.
13MURMUR MURMUR WASHING MACHING

Ugh, Fight Club is one of the most overrated movies ever and Day After Tomorrow is just bad
04Yes, that was my choice too :3
00,10and finaly
Bronysith: okay, my teacher Bruce Campbell in HS was 23, like 400lbs, 6'10" and the BABY of his family...he was the smallest in his family
Midnight_Fyre: agreed
Shizuka: Thank God
day after tomorrow is legit one of the worst disaster movies I've seen
who are the winners so far?
and I've seen birdemic
it's not that bad
13OUTRUN THE COLD!
00,031 Pony + 1000 apple tress = 1/0
seriously, I LIKE TDAT
DSNesmith: but have you seen BIRDEMIC 2?
05,15otakon YOU HAD BRUCE CAMPBELL?
I liked it

00,03trees*
00,10number 60 Mirathrim with Dragonshy
fluttercry: not THAT Bruce Campbell
01,11Wow, season 1 episodes two weeks in a row.
Shizuka: the eagles have got back together along time ago, hells been frozen for a while
05,15there will be a sequel
DSNesmith: yup.
what merciful deity would permit such a thing
00,03Dragons are MLG~
01,11...Both Season 1 episodes. That's cool.
13but the vikes still haven't won a super bowl
DSNesmith: god is dead.
Big guy, wore glasses, works at NASA last I heard.
does it star Kevin Baugh
which reminds me, we should watch The Crucible sometime.
season 1 is best season of MLP
13i'm seeing that VAC latency now..
But Scoot, what isn't MLG?
00,03So anyway, News Time!
13the witch trials?
13there was a movie?
Shizuka: don't worry, this year the Detroit Liions will go all the way
which trials?
yeah
Shizuka: yup.
tons of them
DSNesmith: Dohoho
05,15PACKEEERS
00,03As y'all know, Gigabit Harmonie and Allegr0 made their trip to the Brony Fan Fair today... and yesterday!
I remember the Crucible I think
We should watch Sleepy Hollow some time.
crucible was boring
RAWRity: "More weight." right?
i'm putting The Terminal for next week
I read the actual play before seeing the movie
05,15I can't settle on an A movie
otakon: yup.
was dreadfully dull
the last scene is the only good one
13i remember reading the play for english (i think... most of high school blurs together) but never knew there was a movie
01,11yay for them.
RAWRity: best scene with a badass grandpa
00,03They will be in a panel with cool people like Rina Chan! You can follow thier crazy exploits on Twitter!
04Congrats for Giga and Allegr0
05,15I keep flipping between Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and For a Few Dollars More
00,10Who did what with who now?
00,03https://twitter.com/PixelPonyShow
Meanwhile: As B movie?
As whatever it's classed as.
/me 13wonders if anyone notices derpy is slowly sinking
I cba to look up the budget right now.
god that one
i put Meanwhile in a moustache corset
Shizuka: we had to watch that movie in 11th grade...and then write an essay comparing it to Footloose.
at least douglas was short
05,15It's not a panel Scoot-Scootaloo.
13to... footloose...
DSNesmith: I really liked Crucible, but I find colonial history fascinating
00,03Follow them, and they will get you cookies~
yes
Footloose
really?
REALLY?
AGAIN!?
Kick off your sunday shoes~
00,03You're not a panel >: (
the Kevin Bacon film. yes.
man, why are primary/secondary schools so inane
05,15You're not MLG
seriously, footloose comparison to the crucible?
00,10You will have to provide your own cookies for them to give you
04You're not perfect...
DSNesmith: schools are retarded
00,03:O
till college
DSNesmith: it was more my teacher was a damn fool
05,15#shotsfired
yay
13YOU'RE A NOOB
Meanwhile: Budgetwise it would be A, but it's just not a very good movie I think
but really
Giga and Allegr0 met their goal
04LOOK AT THAT
since hitting uni
04Like right on cue
00,03Anyways, that's all!
04Courage
I like it.
I use almost nothing I learned in middle/high school
they're going to the convention
otakon: sweet,
00,03You can go on your merry way~
quick question
Giga?
05,15oh u
WHY DIDNT THEY COME TO DRAGONCON

GigabitHarmony
Where was Gondor when you can't talk about A movie?
He scares the v;ewhvohh;hnnnw;o out of me
DSNesmith: to be fair, HS is mostly giving you basic skills to function in life.
01,11So yeah, my whole week and weekend kinda sucked.
Inb4 Scoot-Scootaloo x Jake Gylanhall
00,03You guys make me sad... calling me a scrub... :'(
Oh...those 2, lol.

Scoot-Scootaloo you ARE a scrub.
Where was Gondor when we didn't have constant rerolls?
/me has never seen Fight Club
Scoot-Scootaloo, can you name anyone else than Rina-Chan?
honestly they could be doing calc in sophomore year of high school if they didn't waste time with pre-algebra and pre-calc bunk
/me sighs
Scoot-Scootaloo: FUCK your YOLO
RAWRity: it's also one of the most twisted mini societies ever for CHILDREN.
You're like, the scrubbiest scrub who was EVER a scrub.
What is THIS?
You scrub.
PillowPoni: you'll love it ^_^
Ummmm. Did anypony know SimGretina advertised us yesterday on his Youtube? O_O

I see people are talking about fight club
Shizuka: His name is Robert Paulson....
AH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ghosties: Ah, well, it's just, I was kinda hoping I would win for a silly reason. My birthday's next Tuesday so I was hoping, maybe, just this once...xD
shame on you
In elementary school I learned that you can do whatever you want if no one saw you do it.
YOU WILL CATCH HERPES IF YOU DARE SAY THAT NAME!
Ponies47: Shall do
Silverscreen Your Twilght Trixie fic?
Lord of the flies, great book
bronysith, is that the "tails gets trolled" comic

Ghosties: Ah well. Perhaps in the future.
they (spoilers) the (spoilers)
13man i got swindled out of all the cool things...
no, no it's not
In high school I learned that the same thing applies, but also that people are shit.
:(

iirc, Lord of the Flies was the firts book I read in HS
Silverscreen Twilight* (Sparkle)
What was the B movie?

Sorry.......................:'(
WHO ARE YOU?
fluttercry, it shouldn't be a bannable offense, only a kickable offense.
What A movie? Fight Club?
13i remember being horribly bored with lord of the flies
did i read that EQD post right? there's some pony meetup convention happening in illinois?
kidzrul434: Day after tomorrow
But....I never seen A movie before

fluttercry: Add it to the topic, lol
mine was probably Gatsby
But The Day After Tomorrow is cools
ugh
So Dragonshy again huh? Guess that means we'll see FiW again afterwards. ABBALANCHE!
In high school i learned that no friends are truly loyal >.>
Yo, Algol. Who're you.

Ah.
I have no favorite books I was first to read.
Er, the mods need the kick script.

Day After Tomorrow? Drat, pretty sure I've seen that one before.... ah well, be good to see it again I suppose
I HATED Catcher in the Rye

HoodyNinja: first rule of fight club. u dont talk about fight club
PillowPoni: Yeah it's pretty good, the ending always sends a chill down my spine.
HoodyNinja: i heard of it....IS IT THAT BAD?
/me licks otakon s hoof
/me beats Bronysith with a pool noddle.
war bar
noddle?
Noddle.
Dueling Buddies
dammit
Pffffffffeeheeeeheeheeee
typo
Ryunosuke: xD Love it
Noddle.
*wet pool noodle
DSNesmith: And in college I had to read The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spencer, which I sort of liked once I got a handle on the old timey speech
Colt_Silver: I'm not involved in fight club, therefore i am not required to adhere to its rules
NODDLE
YES THE MIGHTY NODDLE!
AAAAHAHAHAAAAHAAHAAHAHAA
XD
Ryunosuke: Well the B movie should cool everyone down after the A movie. Huh, huuuh?
Silverscreen: You ain't got no pancake mix!
goddamn everyone keeps talking about Battle Society
HoodyNinja: because apparently, you're going nuts the wrong way, if you know what i mean
13who stole my pool noodle :<
Ryunosuke: *nudge nudge*
Fucking noddle.
yay I made it
Dear lord otakon.
o.o
now I have to come up with what a noddle is...
For the intermission
my seminar prof last semester tried to make us read, uh... I don't even remember the name of it
Shizuka: no no, a noddle
EleanorAwesome: You missed bat man
Shizuka: otakon did it >_>
PillowPoni: I think we can enjoy a STALE movie! (Ha ha ha... >_>)
NOT a noodle
what r we watching now?
13oh
it was really bad though
otakon: when a women and a table love eachotehr very much...
00,10wonder if I can set a script to kick on saying the name of the A movie
XD
Oh, I have a question
I never knew talking about the A movie was kickable. Why didn't anyone tell me?
NO
PillowPoni, it should BRRRRRRRing in some laughs I admit
Shizuka: he wanted to get in and see daribot again >_>
that is NOT a noddle
Sumica: "The A Movie"
O_O
HoodyNinja: how is that movie?
Mrs. Dalloway
I knowwwww I was at the McDonald
05,15But....The Great Gatsby was my favorite thing from 11th grade
terrible fucking book
Dude, noddle is slang for skull.
Sumica: The A movie? You mean Fight Club? I love that movie
Sumica And then next week's BMN is nothing but kicks.
Do it.
RAWRity: dude, we should do a reading of "The Moderator" one day
What about Combat Establishment's similarly named aerial group members, Flight Club?
EleanorAwesome: there's always Euro Night
Dark92Enigma: Awesome
00,10that joke dont work with the way I worded it Colt_Silver, nice try
05,15Sumica probably
00,03...That sounds pretty nifty! DO IT!
iirc
You all and your books :D
Vordox, Ryunosuke: They'll be frozen in their seats
RAWRity: for those with mics anyway, which is most of us IIRC
*tries*
this was discussed
I need to read more....
various times
Crime and Punishment was good for the first half and the very end
fluttercry: I liked it too. It's certainly beter than "Their Eyes Were Watching God" that year.
ugh
Strife Bludgeon
but that last quarter or so was just painfully slow
HoodyNinja: REALLY!? I'M IN FOR A TREAT! :)
You're right, thanks
so we're watching Batman right now? I just got here so i dunno
well we know what meme will be overused next week :)
I didn't like TEWWG either
PillowPoni: Indeed, it's quite a chilly public response.
I didn't get it
Akin to noggin, or cap, the brainbone, topper, or me' old mug.

dem railings
13i remember being okay with the glass menagerie
Then people will get confused who don't read the front page. What's the A movie? "We can't say it!"
Ryunosuke, next week? We're overusing it NOW
I snow it will bring in the usual meme
Only books I've read: The Hot Zone, and Ender's Game.....
Things Fall Apart
Ryunosuke What is this 'meme' you speak of?
fuck
that
book
actually that one wasn't bad
05,15Things Fall Apart can go die
Colt_Silver: It was the A so you missed it
seriously fuck that book
05,15I hated that book
Ah, Ender's Game
really?
Shizuka: I didn't have Menagerie until Senior year.
wow really?
RAWRity: FUND IT
13things fall apart was boring as hell
I loved that book
inb4
err
In Junior High I had to read a novella called The Human Comedy, which I absolutely hated
be back in a little bit guys
*open free cookies stand*
13yeah i think it was senior for me too
JESmith71: The A movie is Fight Club
inb4 I WAS FROZEN TODAY
shh
Did u guys hear about the Raritylicios vid? I heard Tabitha did the voice herself for the animation
I liked it
Did I miss a day where talking about the A movie was unallowed? :S
bye BladedWings
I didn't love it
Ryunosuke: oh don't be so down about it, I'm sure it will be ice
13i read one for a history class called red dust i think?
And I have read none of this stuff, again presumably because unlike the rest of you I'm not a tremendous nerd.

13was about apartheid
HoodyNinja: You fool, what have you done?!
ah, in time for the B film'
Cool, i was proposing the A movie previous week:) (In wrong place, and it was more of a test, but still)
01,11I went home for Labor Day weekend to get away from Campus. Ended up doing work all Saturday and Sunday anyway. I get into a fender bender on my way home on Monday that f**ked up the right side of my car. Tuesday I find out that it'd cost over $500 to fix said right side. Wednesday I started getting sick and I only get half the work done that I should have done. And today I foundnd
1,11out that my bank screwed me over and I now owe them $120 dollars in addition to being sick as hell.
TOMORROW MORNING*
PillowPoni: Even reviewers showed a cold shoulder.
Senior Year also had Mama Day, Anil's Ghost, The Things They Carried, Hamlet, Twelfth Night, and A Streetcar Named Desire
things fall apart was a shitty book about a shitty character, with a shitty moral it shoved down your throat, and had shitty prose, and a shitty plot
Meanwhile: or you weren't assigned bookwork like us in High School
AJIsAwesome: It's supposed to be a joke regarding the A movie for next week, Fight Club.
00,03what a story, mark
And what's the B movie, BTW?
aww that sucks Silverscreen
DSNesmith: so you're saying it was....?
Shitty right?
DSNesmith: to be fair, the shitty prose is the fault of shitty translation.
otakon my high school English teacher once told me "You are a horrible bully, go away."
PillowPoni, I am actually kinda cool with next weeks b movie
/me puts otakon in a full nelson
MrBen: Well, how was I supposed to know? I thought they were just joking around. :S
the funny thing is, tyler kept saying never to talk about it because he *wanted* them to talk about it.
Silverscreen: go on..
/me dodges
okonkwo is the least likeable character I have ever read about
13the only thing i remember from things fall apart is the main character is okonkwo
yes
Silverscreen: When life gets you down, get up and kick life in the face!
Prepare your toots
Oh? Are we watching what it's really called in Discordia "Starship Bloopers"?
DSNesmith: but that is NOT the point
13and there's a 419 scam email in doom 3 from an okonkwo
AJIsAwesome: Well, because to be honest, I'm not sure if they're NOT joking, myself...
05,15Senior Year I read Things Fall Apart, Beowulf, Dante's Inferno, The Stranger, The Metamorphosis, and Hamlet. I loved all but the first
Scoot-Scootaloo: I did Naught hit hehr, ees bullshit, i did naught
inb4 toot spam
ah, Beowolf
AGAIN: Tommorrow is the ENCORE PRENSENTATION of the Royal Wedding.......just in case you all want to RELIVE THE MOMENT!
bateman is at least entrancingly evil
MrBen: Okay, thanks for letting me know.
Silverscreen: ouch.
I've read only the first
we had to read the old version
okonkwo is just a brute
Silverscreen: Shit, son. Forget a hug, you need a full on full body massage.
HoodyNinja: I know, but Sumi and the others are joking (I hope it was a joke) about using a kick script if you say the movie's name. Hence we'd get a bunch of kicks if people come in asking "What's he A movie?"
ARGH!
If I ever did work in English it was doodling in the margin and taping signs to people.
01,11I stayed home and slept half of today away. The other half I left to see The Avengers, paid for with pocket money.
AJIsAwesome: No problem.
13i have the stranger on kindle but haven't gotten to it
I hated the old version of Beowulf
Vordox, Ryunosuke: The crowd's reactions are polar
Well I'm out, goodbye folks.
13metamorphosis i think we did
I was assigned Madame Bovary
Silverscreen damn those beaurecrats---
fluttercry: Ever have to read any Chaucer?
I would rather read heart of darkness again than things fall apart
*Sigh* now I'm depressed a little bit.
05,15Oh yeah we read The 13th Warrior too
JESmith71: The A movie? You mean Fight Club?
I read that in a Reader's Digest actually
ermahgerd, my train is just half an hour away
13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dust_(novel) ha i was right
fluttercry: -_____-
00,10Problem?
Title on en.wikipedia.org: Red Dust (novel) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
and heart of darkness sucked
05,15Midnight_Fyre yes we had to read Canterbury Tales
Funfact: for English senior year, my friends and I had to make a Parody movie of Hamlet, and it had to be at least 30 mins long. We made outs 60 just to piss off the teacher.
13problem?
13where
01,11A moment of silence for my suffering? :P
13i will end it
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
*ours
good lord, I wanted to strangle everyone in my English class for liking that book
i have so many games on my "To play list"
RAWRity: you are a magnificent bastard :)
RAWRity lol
Where was Gondor when banned for saying the A movie title?
Problem?
Bronysith: Borderlands 2?
metamorphosis was good, but depressing
Dark92Enigma, thanks for reminding us. I'll really be looking forward to watching for a Season 3 announcement.
Tess of the D'Ubervilles > Bovary
HAHAHAHAHA! NINJA'D BY THE MODS! I love it! Respect +20
DAMNIT Sumica :D
Everypony, a moment of silence for Silverscreen
No Toot spam?
DSNesmith: eeyup, and it's circular at that
Thank you so much for that!
Lol got us good
otakon: no someone gifted me that on pre order so i am good
TOOT anyway
Bronysith: you lucky
no toot spam today
i swear
Bronystate I am proud
05,15We had a project to make our own circles of Hell. It was the best project ever because I got to list types of people that pissed me off and how I would punish them
i will end you
13Sumica: you cut off one of the channels don't you
Bronysith: I don't have the money atm
/me gives Silverscreen and Scoot-Scootaloo a hugzie.
05,15Got 100 on that
13lost like half the synth there
sumi
all the "oppressed minority group" books were generally terrible
fluttercry: 13th Warrior (Eaters of the Dead) is a great book. Michael Crichton (RIP) was a great writer. Too bad the movie, like most Crichton films, was crap
01,11I've actually entertained the idea of making my fanfic a clopfic.
sumica
otakon: i have to play legend of dragoon, FFVIII, shadow of the colossus,
hey CrimsonPhoenix
13and volume leveling which is good
ahhh... my lil bro is having a "cool" premature party, with Js & booze... my mom will so KILL him when she's back...
00,10I did no such thing Shizuka
Night, Things Fall Apart, Heart of Darkness, The Color Purple
Silverscreen: ...and that's a bad thing?

NO!
Toot toot toot toot
13well yeah
Huck Finn was good
Silverscreen: No!
13stereo stream?
I liked those middle two >.>
"Pikie climaxed as confetti shot out of her ass, littering the floor like it was some frat house on Initiation Day."
MOvie time. And I STILL didn't get my tea
what's more, the teacher had to watch the whole thing to grade it. And we made sure that every bit of required criteria was there to get a 100. But the jokes? The writing? purposefully awful so as to make her suffer.
Silverscreen: Bad Silverscreen, BAD!
AWRIGHT, LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED!
Then the TOOT spam happens tomorrow when Crimson's not looking
Silverscreen do it it would still read it
*pays attention to the chat* mod talking about his clopfic *O.O*
/me catches Colt_Silver's hoof and uses his momentum to throw him into the wall.
oops better not do that again
00,10we can only stream in stero
because FUCK her.
Silverscreen Interesting idea??? :S
Be right back, guys. Gotta pack.
DSNesmith: Yes, but I always preferrred Tom Sawyer
13you can set fmle to use mono
what we watching now
starship troopers boys
STARSHIP TROOPAHSS!!
13must have just been compressed out by the leveling
I couldn't stand him
00,10hahah no
what movie is this
13was very odd
Silverscreen: Your the writer, do what you want. But I probably wont read it if it's clop
01,11What's this week's B movie?
oh
huck was much more likeable
STARSHIP TROOPER OH BUCK YEAH
yay i like dis movie
OH BUENA VISTA! that's a good sign

What movie?
01,11...wow, this movie brings back memories.
kids?
fluttercry: reminds me of my "Science and Ethics" elective in HS. Great class, grade was based on book reports though. I just passed it by the bare minimum bc I couldn't find any non-fiction books I wanted to report on with gusto. But my final was "My Utopia" which was very well received, not a SINGLE person asked for explanations of it's workings.
is this the first one?
I'm doing IPOD
LOLZ]

Silverscreen: I know a guy who constantly calls me and everything I do gay, thinking of it as an insult
Dr HOrrible
hi frizzy
Occupy Wallstreet lost their argument, they concluded that their enemies are too stubborn so they want to do violence too.
I just ask myself "Is it over 65?" If it is, or on it, I'm happy.
Is that a younger Neil Patrick Harris?
otakon: Because they're supposed to have power armor, which were dropped from the movie, and the director didn't understand that soldiers need some sort of air mobile and armor to make up for it.
she's my favorite character
*troll*
Dr. Hauser!
Buffering and lag makes Fluttershy sad: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v135/J.E.Smith/flutterbuffer.png

oh my god, it's Neil Patrick Harris!

Niel you stud
Barney?!
It's NPH
"Don't make me sing a musical while talking bout SUITS!"

I'm getting a bit sleepy here

Crippler: THE funny thing is, Harvard is going through hard times
they are troopers that ship stars
Vordox: quantity of what?
i kinda feel weird here. i know enough about command line/terminal stuff to understand the basics (cyber crime tech requires a lot of non-gui programs) but I know very little about coding language.

At my homecoming dance, everyone was bunched into the middle of the room and they were bare foot.
Don't worry, it could be worse.
I'm studying my second year of Java... it's pretty neat. At least compared to FREAKING VISUAL BASIC they forced me to waste a year on.

VB is only useful if you plug XNA into it, and they only gave it that recently, and then it's only good for programming games.
ahh celestia radio. very nice
I've screencaped it:D
hmm, what's with the buffers lately?

I'm honestly unsure of what I'm going to do after college either. One the one hand, there's some tech companies out here that I could work for, on the other, the law side of Cyber Crime is what really interested in me, and I'm thinking of joining a police force.
Mooooooo

13poking the program files folder tells me it's 30MB but that can't be accurate, it probably drops plugins and such elsewhere
hahahah they censored the cow but not the humans :P

I cant spell I guess
Oh hai Lex Luthor

badass sargeant
13like most editors it'll take about 1.5x the time of the video you're rendering to render, but much more if it's complex
05,15Full Metal Jacket was better
Hello there, Drill Sergeant Nasty.

Shizuka: that depends on your comp, too.
Every Seargent tries to be like R. Lee Ermy.
04I like this guy, though
1320 minute intermission took a little over an hour to render out, but that was mostly from the reversed clock in the corner
I guess maybe I do. Sir.
04He kinda seems like an earlier Tom Hardy
asswhuppin' time
fluttercry, R. Lee Ermy kinda set the standard for real drill sergeants.
going to get pwned
oh my
ATACK

Suddenly, TF2 references. . . In the past.
05,15I'm always afraid my computer will melt during rendering
SHIP!
SON OF A BITCH, SIR
MrBen: ^
Pain is weakness leaving the body.
MrBen: :D
Ghosties: GOLDBERG: WHO'S NEXT?
where Everlasting_Joy?
fluttercry: get a big ass heatsink.
BITCH
Now he has a crush on her?
Pain is in your mind! It is the way telling you when your body is under attack!
Gnight my fellow psychopaths and the pyro Shizuka
13i know probably 30% of the render time was just because the countdown clock is a reversed chroma-keyed video
lol
Suddenly fighting
ooooohhhhh
WAOH
O_O
oh my

Because I have BOOBS!

BUT ITS SO AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEE
Hey Mcfly!
That certainly is Busey...AND HE'S GOT A BOMB!
of course, being willing to wantonly break solider arms would make for a pathetic squad to go against the bugs
13the instant the render finishes it'll drop like 20C core temp
Young gary busey is scary
The pony everypony should know
Sergent why u no do something?!
MEAT really?

hopefully dad can approve my $1500 build

fluttercry: no
the case was basically a lunchbox

To think, we almost had Blue Brothers for B Movie. Bullet dodged.
fluttercry: A what? ^-^
Wait, the twins need to come too!
13they last me a while though, both times i've upgraded was only because of the hard drive space and ram
fluttercry:lolwut
I want to learn to build a good computer already
I actually liked this movie

Lol giant snake dragons.
Impreal Ship ahead.

OohShiny: implying ponies know about human anatomy to care
That's true.

Flash Plugin crashed again
13my server haruko is kind of built... or at least i stole most of the components from a few other prebuilts
same scene from starwars with the milenium falcon
yeah...
this movie could use MORE giant snake dragons... for variety, cause the bugs are pretty boring after awhile when all they can do is zerg rush
DSNesmith: jesus, what kind of shitbox were you working with?
Look at dat moon.

NullRadix: well, they are always using clothes, and then they're naked
well there's your problem
Dark92Enigma: more like use the nukes amiritie?
05,15I'd like to build my next computer. I wasted a lot of money buying this computer
by that point the only original component was the case
SilverScreen it was bad.
shit, 4:30... that's it for me, good night everyone have fun with the rest of the movie and ponies
Wow, it's amazing. I never you could make a movie with so much pointless filler...
Silverscreen: so bad rifftrax couldnt save it
13>connector is right next to ram sticks
D wars was rifftraxed -.-
RAWRity better than HP
gnight Eli
and maybe the optical drive
Goodnight Eli.
Dragon Wars is that kind of movie you watch for the CGI, nothing else
NullRadix: Ponies didn't see that incoming

HOLY SHIT
Sumica: isnt usually the other way?
so, they're zerg rushing the zerg?
*rewind*
why yes, bugs poop nto the orbit
ass-blasters
you see watch
Yes because bugs are responsible for shit.
ANUS BLASTERS
eww?
Ass Blasters
Yay for bick bugs
No tanks or vechicles at all for some reason
ass cannon
EWWWWW
13linux's only central planning is at the kernel, everything else is horrifyingly disorganized
Apple's been getting more and more shit with each generation because they abandoned a fundamental policy: each new release should be an improvement in every way specs-wise.
nothin but bug shit
HUMAN RUSH! JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA!
lol where are the tanks
How the heck do the bogs shoot at eascape velocity out their butts?
They're trying to outswarm the swarm... bad idea.
tanks
Ha, I have a friend with a Macbook. Such a drone for it, no matter how often I tell him to stop feeding them./
It's so pretty
WE MOBILE ARMOR
ummm SHOT IT
poop missile
NUKE EM
He farted out blue cannons.
twilight_sprinkle: thanks. I think i just have to go to therapy from what my podiatrist said. but he wants me to get that MRI just to be sure.
WE DON'T NEED NO STINKIN TANKS
they had some spicy tacos..
NUKEM
Kurra: super heated plasma

Kurra: uh... Diarhea?
DUKE NUKEM
THROW THE CHEESE!!!!!
yummyyy
:o
BOOM
nuclear rpg. gotta love the future
mega fart
Bugjuive.
Whoop de doo
they took the basic idea of this part and removed all that made it have a sense in the book
13it's sad reading /r/linux sometimes because every year someone's convinced it's the year linux will take the desktop
to be fair, in the book, they didn't need tanks cause they had power armor
CHARGE
01,11Boom
Wow that was easy.
Am I surprised? no.
MAKIN' BACON
OohShiny... i'm not wanting dinner anymore. x.x
fluttercry: and taht cosmetic change is AWFUL.
04Damn, I wanna play Fallout so bad now

ZUUL MOTHERFUCK---HEY!
Follow MEEEEEEEEEEEE.
13except on tablets
Yaaar!
zerg rush versus where in the original is huge humanoid bugs VS space marines
fluttercry: THE FUCKING "MODERN" INTERFACE.
DIE FUCKER
I'm just picturing Samus Aran going through all this
Harder than Vista, and that's saying something.
fluttercry they could have avoid a shitstorm if they wouldn't have remove the windows button
ded
Ow.
dem tactics
LOL
FIRE FROM THE HIP
SMILE YOU SON OF A BITCH!
Man 2324443 was slained by Bug 34343
13it'll give iPad a little sting on tablets

Are you even hitting it!
useless armer is uselfess
He's gonna be feeling that one.
Fenr: seriously, WHAT is the goddamn logic of fighting a creature that is NOT hampered by injury in combat effectiveness?
00,10they should have brought more firebats
seriously, their guns SUCK
Wait, Trix, go back there.
windows 8 sucks donkey dick
ded.
windows 8 is just a beta for windows 9, just like vista was for 7
those are some big zerglings
Samus would do better than this whole army.
Ghosties . . . I should actually consider playing Fallout now that you mention it
Ultralisk's anorexic cousin
Trix what did you just say
dont the ship has cannons?
Cho'gathlings
SPIIIIIIIDEEEEEERSS
05,15I think there will be enough people that are tech ignorant that they will buy enough to make it a success
no there aim just sucks
took them 1 to kill 1
It almost looks like those grenades detonated something inside the bombadier beetle's rear-ends.
Ghosties to stomp some radrouches?
Tropa 232 was slained by bug
Should've invested in AP rounds.
05,15which sucks
I mean it takes a good 10 troops to kill ONE bug
oh fuck
YOUVE ALERTED THE SWARM
ZEEEEEEEEEEEERG RUSH
OH hai Dr Smith
Zerg rush!
Ignited
it'S not the guns that suck, it'S the guys firing them
ZERG RUUUUUSH!
Zerg Rush!
vista wasn't a beta, it was INTENDED to be good
shoot them?
uuuuhhhhh i dunno
I think the girl pilot is ded.
04I dunno why...I guess I just wanna roam the wastes
SHOOT THEM?!!?!?
they just fucked up the drivers and security and everything
SHOOT THEM IDIOTS
that's why in the book they fight it with what became the 40k space marine
SPIDDDERRRRSSSS.
A note to anybody who wants to make money: before the launch of Win8, buy as many versions of Win 7 as you can for when your less techsavvy friends shit themselves.
13vista's problem was the driver overhaul
Trix what did you say about the Windows button
SHOOT THEM
NUCLEAR MISSLE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
KILL'EM!
Good plan
KILL THEM! KILL THEM ALL!!
Reikim there is no button for the menu in your lower left side
So many Starcraft referances are to come.

Moron
ouch

NOOOOO!!!
He's so fucked.
13ticking the version counter to 6.0 broke everything and the drivers wouldn't keep up to save the launch
You're not a commando
NOOOO PEDRO !
(to be honest...a bit more powerful than a 40k space marine..THEY CARRY FRIGGIN NUKES AS PERSONAL WEAPONS)
So ded
01,11Random question: Why aren't they using the lazers from Training?
that gotta hurt
you can get a system builder version for only 100 bucks

Isn't this suppossed to be a comedy?

the lasers were just for show

"The Buffer, Its Unbearable!" Shall be my caption for that buffer
well, I'm not getting any sleep tonight for sure
it just got so much bad press that no one uses it
This movie has the best buffers:D
Reikim: that is the horror of the "modern" interface.
He ded.
Nope, sorry 8, cannot take you seriously anymore.
I can't breath due to perfect buffer
B-B-B-B-UFFER BREAKER
BUFFER PLEASE BUFFER
wat benthis
kill two bugs, retreat
And another one bites the dust.
Or not.
NOW
8 is a turd though
reverse-mine?
otakon: actually, they're quite effective. barney stinson proved it. also quite usefull in the game
ded
every buffer is the stream saying "fuck this shit"
NOW
cdead
ded
LOL
NOW
RAPE
I've noticed that pretty much no movies accurately display patients going into shock. if your leg gets cut off, you would probably react as if you just got a bee sting or something
MrBen: 13 buffers?
Busey is ded.
ded
because its problem is way more than internal
dammit
THOSE bugs aagonne rape them so hard
the UI is utter shit
man humans are lossing BADLY
Microsoft, stop trying to be Apple, and do shit.
buffer there would of been perfect
and that's not something that they'll fix
Silverscreen (Insert Adult noise from the Snoopy cartoons) Oh, did they forgot to include them? ok
LunarRepublicGuard: As many as I counted from my end.
The black guy always dies 14th.
RETREAT!
and IM SO DRUNK
RUN AWAAAY!
Don't think to use flame based weapons?
Dark_Horst: yeah against one immobile(basically) bug, NOT hundreds at a time.
LunarRepublicGuard: Did I miss one?
well...that didn't work
well that didnt last long
great success
Don't try to replicate Apple's shiny modern interface, because it sucks.
humans needs to have heavy viechals
Gee, it probably was a bad idea to attack without thinking.
they should've loaded up with alot more nukes.
13the only reason i bought asuka was for the massive ram and hard drive upgrade (plus geforce 8300 is a terrible GPU)... otherwise i would have happily continued with vista on kimiko
Win8 is Microsoft trying to make a platform taht's the same on desktop, smartphone, and tablet. And it's a horrible idea.
BUG
yeah everyone's trying to be apple these days
dat propaganda
die
Dead
otakon: they're also hundrets of noobs

Bug planet you say?
this is good idea
MrBen: idk
HUuug
It's an ugly planet! A BUG planet!
HUGGIES

Also, super useless body armor

Reikim also you must scroll acroos everything you own to find an application D:
what are you doing cameraman?
RUN
that camera dude is stone cold
hug bug
the munchies
ITS THE ZERG
13horizontal scrolling with a mouse
that doesn't protect against bug bits
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL FILMING IT?!
You know, I could watch a Red Cross blood drive in my neighborhood and get the same visual effect XD
Silverscreen the writers* forgot to include them
lol eic cameraman
IN TWO
13someone at microsoft came in drunk that day
01,11Cameraman's Job: Just film, don't act.
And almost none of them are firing whilst retreating... why?
Shizuka: ...NO.
NO
Poor Hank. Well, he'll recover from his injuries next season.
and the book makes a point in having the first attack of the hundreds of space marine go...AS BAD as the one in the film
http://i.imgur.com/lzVWP.jpg
If they fail to fix the interface in successive versions of Windows, I will break down and get Linux.
04How awesome it would be if the cameraman survived
Silverscreen: dying an option?
Ded.
04Like the whole movie
I don't know if I'll go that far
13unless you have one of those mice with left and right scroll built into the wheel.. and even then it's abysmal
RUN AWAY! RUN AWAAAAY!
LOL
I might just stick with 7
It times like this that you really need a tank
ew
Get that angle :P
00,03They look like antlions...
I really do like 7
ewwww
lol he ded

Ghosties: but he cant
Ow
He hit him with his OWN buddy
I will build a goddamn computer and install Linux from scratch and abandon Windows completely.
Now he ded.
04He'd probably end up being my favorite character...but oh well. Camerman died
Dumbass camera man
stupid cameraman
7's great, but what about when it becomes obsolete?
TONS OF BULLETSSSSSSSSSSSS
get back dude
Out of ammo
i don't even want many desktops i only have one with a few shortcuts
and it's STILL not dead

HOW BIG IS THE CLIP
Scoot-Scootalo STAY OFF THE SAND

linux isn't that hard if you get one with a gUI

Shotgun SLIGHTLY more useful
OUT OF AMMO
Oh look another one
the game starship troopers also does that. though, int he game youÖre a marauder. badass guy in badass armor killing hundrets of bugs. but yeah, the first attack wave got massacred there too

It's a nice change.
cowvarkian: but money
Kandarihu: closest I can think of is 300
Napal Strikes inbound!
What ever happened to being the bug?
Troy: no babies
13building a CPU in wiremod is the most fun thing i've done in a long long time
04...WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST DO THAT THE FIRST TIME?!
MrBen: No kidding.
Well they burn at least
I like how none of us are paying attention to the movie
twilight_sprinkle, I wasn't expecting it out of this movie.
WHY did they not do this in the beginning?
because bombing them is useless
Ghosties: bc the Federation are idiots
I am
Ghosties: They assumed the bugs were stupid last time.
Ghosties: The plot demanded it?
umm why they didn't do that at the beginning?
Ghosties: SAME HERE!
they live underground XD
00,10people are cheap bombs are expensive Ghosties
They wanted bloodshed.
I'm using the site embed
CANADIAN_BRONY: CANTERLOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
I hate that, everyone think becasue I majored in CS that I want to make games, well screw that ,I wanna do more stuff than that
Hell, nobody ever pays attention to the movie.
NUKE IT
GO SAM FIND SARAH
me and my friend are watching it
Ghosties dumbasses thought the bugs weren't intelligent
13i haven't really watched the movies for a while...
04Damn red tape
LunarRepublicGuard: They thought the bugs were stupid.
ah, nvm
roast bugs my favourite :)
Algol i'm watching the movie
bombs arent that expensive
NO CANTERLOCK CRUISE CONTROL FOR ROYAL

Ghosties: stop using erewd text then
00,10that scope seems silly
Ringo's here?
BUG
they are so organized now
00,10it's not like it's a diffrent gun
I do really enjoy this movie though, it's just delightfully stupid
04Never :<
Oh guys, you so silly... don't you have enough processing power to multitask?
except the astronomy parts
ugh
lol at that huge flashlight on the gun
13but yeah, my last link there, it's amazing
those are painfully stupid
oh yeah, napalm is more expensive than people
how is this possible
It's about dinnertime for me. How close are we to the end of the movie?
Quick_Thinker: learning through pain principle
they used laser guns when training
Oh yeah
lol huge flashliught
Humbugs are my favorite bugs. So sweet and tasty.
I've seen this one a couple times, so I'm not missing much
Wait now the gun is working? What?
Kandarihu: Far.
Kandarihu nowhere
I tried to do that Shizu, I really did.
why don't they use laser guns?
Overkill Much?
Ghosties: (Insert adult gibberish sound from the Charlie Brown cartoons) OH the writers thought about that NOW
first fight they sucked and this time they kick ass
But no tiiiiiime
seriously the mentality of using HUNDREDS of rounds to kill ONE goddamn bug makes me insane
oh we got the alamo coming up, don't we
lol
00,10good thing it's not acid blood
eww
Shizuka i don't thin i have the patience to build that
overkill
He shot his eye out.
OVERKILL
he got SLIMED
yumm
gross
13that's why i did it in wiremod :3
You've got something on your face.
That slime is delicious.
There's no kill quite like overkill
I might retry but no tiiiiiiiime
OohShiny: bc those were underpowered training guns.

srsly
mini nuke
so in this world you can die and come back just like that
from that distance
Scoot-Scootaloo: bc it doesn't kill instantly but that is better
ohhh the cave, good move
okay, not fail
DAMN
fail? oh wait...
By far, is it another hour? More?
boom
small nuke . . ?
also I like how the "nuke" is a series of line charges
Why couldnt they do that in the first place?!

Scoot-Scootaloo: not enough stopping power. until a bug of that size burns u, it eats half a platoon. then you'll have a giant killer insect ON FIRE

Scoot-Scootaloo: they don't feel pain and unless the flame is hot enough to incinerate instantly it'll take time to kill them.

Otherwise, isn;t it "Honors, hutt?"

DocSane: Oh that's terrible. :D

This is why you shouldn't fall in love in war
And then a meteorite hits the casket

Soldiers, you have my permission to suit up!
not good
/me walks away witht the crowd
Of all the hearts I knew, her's was the most...human
ohai Neil
Neil finally shows up.
because every single one has different notation
Quick Thinker: the most I've heard about it is cloning sheep; be best to look it up though, we're just here for movies and ponies.
in 10 min, the end up running into the floating casket, causing everyone in the fleet to die
the end
NPH FTW l
bugs outsmart humans
DAHAHAHAHAHA He said "P"! :P
No, it's because you were stupid and did not think things through.
Because we're Nazis!
dying
dieing
neal pactrick harris
Yeah, they were cheaper than napalm, sorry.
00,10P.....brain
thats what thier good at
he's already a coronel?
04But I already P'd
to capture that BRAIN
Haha, he said pee..
what the fuck
04Like five minutes ago
Any much longer?
and people say this isn't a B movie
Sumica . . . :D
Maybe if you SHOOT at them some more!
We dress like Nazis, so Paul Verhooven is saying that they're Nazis.
it's about 15 minutes maybe
like, 20 minutes, IshKlendathuanPony
he learned alot from obi wan
and yes, the guy who made this movie stated that he looked into nazi uniforms to design these guys' costumes. especially the psi corps, seeing how their uniforms resemble the waffen-ss
05,15Wait...just finished high school
another rank jesus
NO.
lol nazis
Neil is insta-coronel
Made colonel in about a year?
yeah, long-ass movie
05,15is now a Colonel
and then they fucked
and yeah, have you seen the promotion rate?
This movie is long.
the only qualification is surviving your superiors
bunch of nazis
fluttercry . . . wha . . .
01,11Or, you know, you use the massive ships you have to just NUKE THE FUCKERS TO HELL!
00,10is that woman wearing a girdle?
deck?
It's like Klingons.
NAZIS!!!!
fluttercry: remember, he was a doctor with 16 years
Then he forgot about Ditzy and had sex with the slut in the end. I'm calling it.
The Longest Movie in the World foar A movie
He just moves up the ranks so well, he is future leader
Mobile Infantry = Canon Fodder
YAY young guile still lives
Silverscreen: Amen, brother!
except less self-destruction, more stupidity
The problem is that Heinlein wasn't writing a book about Fascism.
There s a reason they don't nuke fromorbit
More or less, yeah.
kids
05,15This honestly is the worst military ever
funny
now see in the book, the mobile infantry were more like armor
also, fairly certain that NPH's jacket is supposed to be kinda SS inspired
Silverscreen that would require intelligence, tho
Obviously,the movie skips it
05,15Where's the tanks? Where's the air support?
GOddamn they ARE kids
they dont' need that
kids?
"We're the old men." >Is only 20 years old.
That is a kid
DID he say MEMES?
they have human spirit
00,10kiss ass much suger?
So this is the guy from the beginning of the movie, right?
and courage
00,02i'm confused
fluttercry: he would barely be a fuzzy if he were in the army :D
Rednecks?
the army's approach is basically "Throw as many people as possible at the bugs until they choke on our soldiers' guts."
and chins
00,02how many planets do the bugs have?
WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE
He's an officer now?
Plasma
Doesn't quite have the same flare of Michael Ironside
letting kids fight in wars?
Phase4: several
ASS BLASTERS!@!!!
those kids in the front look younger than me
Bye everypony going to sleep I have ACT tomorrow morning wish me luck:)
Well they are here let's go!
Farting plasma again.
because he's not Sam Fisher
Dusty good luck :>
people in main chat taking this seriously
Phase4: a bunch. movie doesnt say
"I suppose it's right over there!"
00,02otakon, so they have achived space travel?
sigh
night Dusty good luck
Night Dusty and good luck!
Dusty: Good luck.
Dusty: goodluck
Dusty: good luck
POOT POOT POOT POOT POOT
pre-Blackwatch Sam anyways...
... nice dodge
Don't get too close to the misslies you idiots!
Thank you :)
Good luck, Dusty! Sleep well!
I thought it was just one planet o.o
Dusty: Bye! GOod Luck! :)
Phase4: technically, they actually just cast their spores into space
00,10they realy need to stop parking the fleet so close together and right on top of the planet.
g'night Dusty
Mane chat is where you go when you're a dingbat.
If those guys were Nazis, then they are Hitlerjugend:P
Maybe if the ships weren't spaced only 20m apart...
Phase4: maybe they just evolved similarly
Okay these pilots are idiots
Maybe they should spead out a bit
00,02otakon, o_O
>evasive action
they are capable of shootingn us down lets us stand in their range
First time: DIDN'T SEE IT COMING
/me pulls out his little party favor thingy POOTPOOTPOOTPOOT
Or you feel like making fun of dingbats.
How much longer are we in this movie for anyway, just out of curiosity?
>in that tugboat of a spaceship? good luck.
05,15oh you mean turn right?
otakon: ikr? and im drunk
ded
It's almost done.
FAIL
lol
yes, becasue flying on close formation worked SO WELL the first time
FINALLY THEY DIE
in 5, dead
denied
Second Time: KNOW IT'S COMING BUT DON'T BOTHER TO TRY DODGIN
Sumica intelligence is obviouly not this species' strong suit
LOL
too late
LOL
wow
idiots
LOL
Now are they ded?
01,11I know, right? After the speech in the begining, I thought launching a big boomer would be their first course of action...
LOL
finally slut is ded
Ow. Ow. Ow.
LOL
ded
What the window broke?
de
Lo
Someone cue me in on what the hell is happening?
Those ships have real issues with maneuvers.
ded*
They are ded.
Titanic reference?
I guess they had to force an ending to this movie somehow.
Canadian_Brony: Military Intelligence is an oxymoron.
now i feel bad laughing
it's called explosive decompression
WELP, THEY'RE GONERS.
when the hull is breached
man, even after OCS, youre barely a lieutenant. This kid got out of high school and got a rank that a SENIOR OFFICER would normally have.
SLUT IS DED LOL
end
I have a Titanic feeling now
They have shields.
incomin grisly scene
Of some kind.
Reikim: bugs are firing plasma at the ships.
i can almost smell the stupidity
The infantry have gone in to find the brain bug and the fleet is standing by.
space is a bitch
Like they wasn't the first time.
Reikim ships in orbits are being shoot down by plasma
Setzer!
Cool
aaaaaaand BUFFER
OH COME ON JUST DIE
otakon dat true man
04But unlike the Titanic, this ship won't take nearly as much time to abandon
ded
Ded
The Roger Young! NOOOOoooooooOOOOOooooo!!!!!
ouch
lolz
ded
ow
Door ded.
OW
Leave her she's dead
My leg!
marta,carlous,dag,mountin,and 2530302 people was slained by bugs
issac death
Death by door.
SAFETY SYSTEM KILL!
dead
no shit?
finally!!!
come to think of it, these bugs are able to fire bursts of plasmahuge enough to cut through their starships... eventhough their shots don't look anywhere near escape velocity
and dead from shock
no shit
So much for safety
lol already dead?
awesome design there
Aaaand there goes the captain.
Not very heroic.
All these leaders dying and stuff...
She's ded jim!
SHE'S DEAD CARMEN!
04MY PARENTS ARE DEADE
04*DEAD
Its a...
Doors! My one weakness!
Also gruesome.
IT'S A TRAP
RosePetal1: Where does that quote come from anyway?
:P
reminds of the halo marine
Abandon ship or abandon all hope!
stupid safety doors
Star Trek I think.
Titanic...
yeah nothing in this is heroic
BIENG LIKE DIVE AND THEN oh noooo
but yeah, this is actually a really entertaining movie
Sooo, I'm guessing this military never developed orbit-to-surface weapons?
mitamaking: taking more lives than saving
especially the parts with heroic music
Abandon ship or YOU WIL DIE!
ABANDON SHIP! FILLIES AND MARES FIRST!!!!!!
pony_300: maybe the fact it's PLASMA and it's massive is enough? or the upper atmosphere and gravity of the Klandathu planets is different enough to allow it?
Ship blew up ded.
OohShiny Star Trek the original series
RAWRity: very
Equip helmet!
What is it with being in charge and dying, unless you're a main character?
fuck im a colt
ded.
iirc, the whole point of the movie was to parody the book
01,11Goddamn, just kill the betraying bitch already.
Reikim: They want the brain bug from the planet, tactically they can't afford to lose the chance.
AlienWarhead: Thanks
looks like i die
Stupid escape pod system.
Reikim: or rather, they never needed to because it's much cheaper to just throw soldiers at the things.
Wait, I just answered my own question.
Dark92Enigma: screw that
Reikim they did for but they don't want to nuke the planet to find the brain bug
232302323 peoples Was slained by bugs
best part is, algol, they didn't tell that to anyone
00,10they realy did not plan on many people makeing it to the life boats
that is worst lifeboat.
MrBen this is a B-movie
yep
so people came expecting a straight adaptation
00,10they only are 2 seaters
Why do they want the brain bug?
They won't I can tell. :|
And... they... die
bodies
Algol: Was the book really serious?
for science
bonk
Reikim know your enemy thingy
damn
yes
Everyone is ded!
Because up till now the bugs have never shown intelligence.
well the book was less over-the-top than this
Ship was slained by bug 23232
the stupidity is vastly played up in the movie
Algol: Was the book any good?
"Piece of cake!" inb4 crash landing
this movie is longggg
I have no idea
And it's totally worth sacrificing all your troops.
04Piece of cake? Battlefield Leverage?
I haven't read it
Canadian_Brony: I just realized I answered my own question while I mentioned these guys were main characters. Main characters aren't allowed to die more often than that.
the book is Heinlein
whoopie deee
05,15I just remember being 6 and seeing this thinking it was the greatest movie in history
Johhnny I love you.
I know this because...TVTropes >.>
00,10worse news
This movie are cool
and all that applies
*more often than not.
Reikim: the military doesn't care. They've got plenty of soldiers waiting to die.
Algol: Ah, I thought you were speaking from experience. Nevermind
it's old school scifi
00,10that ship was your way off the planet
and I mean old-school
fluttercry i know that feeling
Johnny, I...
CARMINEEEEEEEEEEEEEEe
Silverscreen: court-martial her :D
CarMENL.
otakon: I doubt it, the soliders don't seem any lighter. Still those plasma shots didn't look that huge when we saw the bugs firing them. Now these shots are suddenly comparable to the size of their starships
weee, meteor
"Our ride's been blown to smithereens. We're on our own."
Starship Troopers...I thought that was supposed to be a semi-decent book.
CAAAAAAAAAAARMEEEEEEEEEN
00,10your mother ship went down you have no resque
fluttercry: I was about 13 and thought the same thing
inb4 they crashe
seriously???
Johnny the people are crazy
WERE C0MING IN H0T
Chat derp
right into the hive, good landing
In the nest
I SO called that!
better enjoy this movie while you can, starship troopers 2 is boring as hell and starship troopers 3 just horrible garbage
theyre so dead
I thought that about Batman and Robin
damn near industructable
right into a cave of bugs. very nice
just like the second level on halo
with my bullets :D
same, algol
He is so dead
What th how did they surrive.
the Nest!
THEYRE SO DEAD, AND IM SO DRUNK
I was so psyched with that movie
Now kiss
Time to chill out Algol.
Algol: ...ohdeargod
00,10wonder how bad starship troopers 4 is
now even watching clips of it makes me cringe
Dark_Horst: Wait, there were sequels to this?
Knife will help.
We know that the boyfriend will be ded.
YEP
Don't drink and drive a ship
inb4 the knife is useful
well, at least it as a nice survival package
it took me this long to realize Johnny Rico is his full name.
talk about hindsight
05,15Then you grew up and were like "Oh God why"
I still like Batman Forever
pony_300: we didn't see a side by side comparison between the bug blasters and humans, the blasters are bigger then Tankers by far
Sumica: theres a 4?!
Algol: As a kid I didn't think Batman and Robin was excellent, but I did like it and watch it a lot
situation is FUCKED UP
situation is.... fucked
Situation is...
Good thing those mountains broke the lifeboat's fall.
00,10yep
Situation is fucked.
05,15I have that feeling a lot.

NOMNOMNOMNOMNOM
...
BURN THEM
cockroachs.....vsay wah
nope she will live
there is a 2nd and 3rd movie of this right?
Dark_Horst: Alright, well, heh. Thanks for the heads up
Oggy and the cockroaches
What've you got against roaches.
did anyone notice that the standard bugs look like the arachnid enemy from tales of series?
In the book, the bugs used technology. They had guns and stuff, too.
00,02whats this movie called?
00,10and 4th Corrupt
they are bigger at my house
The big bugs still look pretty good
they are disgusting
05,15isn't there a massive artery ther?
I just realized that this CGI is actually pretty good for the mid-90s
04Lagship Troopers
and wriggly
Phase4: Starship Troopers.
and ew
Phase4: Starship Troopers
Hopefully there's not a trap or anything.
04At least in my day it was
Corrupt, yes. But people are saying they are bad movies
Roaches are cleaner than the inside of your mouth.
Sadship Pooters.
Bet you didn't know that did you, cessgums.
Tarship Sroopers
Algol: you ever tried chocolate covered crickets?
Kurra: lol
Ghosties: Lagship xD Yeah, we got a buffer, what...16 times now?
Buffership Stroopers.
they can also be annoyingly resilient against floor cleaner
Meanwhile: dogs mouthes are cleaner too
DECIDE
ALREADY
what
FUCKER
I know things
mouths*
Starship Buffers
Lagship Buffers
01,11<@Ghosties> Lagship Troopers
Midnight_Fyre: agreed
This acting is so insanely hammy.
01,11Yep
oh FUCK THIS
She has plot armor
The force now?
04"She's dead troopers" "She's alive, I know it"
I can't believe I've actually been keeping count.
i dont know how i know but i know
fuck hanging
Meanwhile: you are INSUFFERABLE
seriously, that one giant roach took a while to kill and then another while to throw out
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT
He has the force now?
i have a feeling that my ex is this way ...
LET THE SLUT DIE
04Not a very decisive leader, Rico
Spencer Pooters
They still hang people?
If that were true you'd have left ages ago.
must go over there!
main character time
So props for conviction.
Rosfox: apparently
Rico you do realize your letting more people die right.
okay this part i'm gonna skip, too bloody
its the advisor.
the QUEINN
Algol: you know what roaches AREN'T resilient against? Boot to the head.
XANDER BEST CHARACTER IN MOVIE
the queen
dawwww it's a brain bug
they still had whippings
They whip people in this movie
the queen
Hey look, it's a Metroid.

RASE THE ROOG
da brain
sup queen
RASE THA ROOF
he's so cute
that is one ugly bitch
...oh geeze.
so is the leader developing psychic powers? That would plausibly explain him changing his mind on more than a whim
knife
unfortunately, RAWRity , it's a big roach
King or Queen? :(

The giant roach slug for a butt queen.

Slained_by_pony: BOTH

WHY THE FUCK CAN SHE MOVE HER ARM?
she have no problem on the shoulder?
shoulder wound doesn't seem to be bugging her any
Here's the question
Reikim adrenaline ?
Reikim, that would make sense
SHOOT THE BITCH!!
If the thing ONLY eats brains
It's just a flesh wound, it seems
Good thing that wound on her arm healed.
04Huh
How long does this movie run again?
04You know
pony_300: oh you

04This is just like the scene with Sam and Shelob
AJIsAwesome: almost over
AJIsAwesome very

Suddenly bullets work!
look at her, firing her rifle two handed
00,10wow the 4 of them are doing better then a whole squad
Okay.
Shouldn't a lung be punctured as well?

I'm watching this
AlienWarhead: no cows, NOTHING on the planet besides desert and bugs
Cliches, Y U ALWAYS HAPPEN?

He likes that.
AJIsAwesome: cause this movie is a parody
i wonder if they like that
I'll join for MvM after this scene or the next one.
u like that!!
HERIOIC MUSIC
At least he will die with some dignity.
YOU LIKE THAT?
Black Guy is always a sacrifice
nooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
because they play super dramatic music for this guy
and we dont' even know who he is
Those 400 guys didn't count apparently
00,10and the compression wave killed erebody

NO
00,02good thing all these rocks are made of foam
yay
fluttercry you have to try
AlienWarhead: Rico was sterile afterwards
At least it's not the remake of The Time Machine where they outrun a wave of exploding TIME
Nobody can compete with him when it comes to snark.
yay
The Black Guy's death sacrifice in The Cabin In The Woods wasn't as good.
Phase4, :D
My boyfriend is ded what do I do?
00,10woooooo we set off a nuke we win
wohooo
hooray
oh really
Many have tried, but there can be only one.

The secret to Meanwhile's power is tea.

I only like this movie because it had the actor who played General Granger.
hi SuperBrony64 :P
is that it's not an allegory

it has applicability
One thing I think we can all agree on is that the theme song is fucking awesome
Um
Hello Kinixys and SuperBrony64
Oh thank god. Now I can close photoshop.
This is the only reason.
00,10this has a rifftrax?

05,15AJIsAwesome this was the coopenist movie
BLOOP
I should put in the 2010 Space Battleship Yamato movie
also, it was done by the people who did the new Appleseed
For crying out loud, the entire LotR trilogy didn't get that many.
like, just have it be that the Brain Bug is full of oil, and you've got your Iraq war allegory all laid out for you.
the CG anime
ITS PONY TIME..... Finn : okay
fluttercry: :D
i.imgur.com/WpdQp.png i.imgur.com/FJHbB.png i.imgur.com/0gWzp.png i.imgur.com/XJnvT.png - some clean screencaps if anyone would like
Well this was....better than I originally expected.
rawrity that would cheapen the film
well, I can bare some gore, as I saw in this movie...
We need more people for Mann UP, Im using a surplus ticket too. Who wants in?
not too much, though
Meanwhile: I saved most of them myself
it's not supposed to be a direct parallel to any situation
This would make a great L4D soundmod for when your running to the escape boat/truck/whatever
ScarecrowGanjalf: Was teh Neil buffer real?
it's a poke at warmongering in general
Roll rolll barrel roll (8)
Yes.
mitamaking: yes
BronyState making memes every Friday and Saturday
lol fluttercry and AJIsAwesome have you guys been watchin Game Grumps? :D
00,10alright Meanwhile, show me what you got.
wow
05,15Sketch_Toku_Brony you know it
Funfact: There's a Mass Effect anime film.
And I missed the movie. :P Laaaame.
due out november.
Sir, I don't think we're getting out of this cave...
mitamaking: eeyup
and it looks like ass.
Really?
you could show it in north korea and it would have the same applicability
Damn.
well
01,11Eh, I only give it a 6/10. It establishes good characters, but it's just another war movie set in space instead of earth. You're kinda left empty on a few things as well, which isn't a good thing. So it's not a great movie, just mindless entertainment.
Love the buffer shots.
no
I'M ENDIN IT!
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Yep. :D
I see ponies
you couldn't show it in north korea
btw, brief sidenote
Sumica: There's 16, I cba to go through the list right now. Take the most recent and deal with it. http://i.imgur.com/JwwqF.jpg

Silverscreen: seriously what the FUCK do the bugs eat?
Silverscreen: But if you DO have a brain? XD
05,15they aren't very good
A Mass Effect anime film...it would work, but I doubt they'll pull it off.
berrypunch you shut your goddamn mouth
00,10PM then Meanwhile
AJIsAwesome: man we need Game Grumps streamed :D
Silverscreen: The weird thing about this movie is that is a good allagory of the Iraq and Afgan wars
no
who left the cider out?

did anyone screencap that probe buffer shot?
oho foley was used in this
wonder what for
RAWRity like any movie from a video game it will suck
probably bug noises
i suppose if you have the mind of a 7 year old then they might be slightly funny
Silverscreen: dat head on reference :D
Yes.
This was Starship Troopers wasn't it?
Well, I think I'm gonna head on off.

the prince of persia movie was pretty good
Applechip: Meanwhile did, just showed it look up
win
Silverscreen oh I made that one

Fall wather friends
Here are my thoughts on this movie..........the problem with it wasn't the characters........for the most part. But the inconsistency, followed by it's corniness filled with it's cliches it's only leveled by the FX.----------other than that, it was just a propaganda for the army, with cliche characters included........other than that, it was good mindless entertainment, and a good pick 6.5/10

Sketch_Toku_Brony: Goof Troop, We always reset together,
Good grief /10
Canadian_Brony: well, he's completely ignoring real life ponies then?
Silverscreen were*

Buytoast eeyup

Day After Tomorrow
AJIsAwesome: man dat music is BOOPIN'

HEY
I like that movie
somewhat
so lottery was today?

eeyup

There any room in that mvm game?
Yep

:(
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Pause balls, I'm goin upstairs,

Last I checked, there was a space or two.

What are the winning pony episodes? I missed them.
That message from Rarity that Blackgryphon animated....
welp that wasn't an autokick
what's the lottery results?
Indeed, that was a Tom kick.
00,02:P
CrimsonPhoenix: I saw that. That was pretty good.
CrimsonPhoenix: say waht
01,11Batman? 8/10. The iconic character was brought to life really well, but I felt it fell through on several things. The story felt a little rushed and half-thought through, and aside from Batman, Joker and the Viki Vale, the characters were bland and forgetable.
The more I hear it the more I'm ready to say that Tabitha herself voiced it
/me runs to check
Spectrum_Rush: Have you not seen it yet?
CrimsonPhoenix ikr? she isn't best pony for nothing <3
but honestly
the episodes are yellow horse talks shit to a dragon and orange horse gets tired and shit
Buytoast: so? do you ignore the real life not-thinking not-talking ponies?
Karen Traviss was the worst writer
Inloving memory O.o :O :'(
AJIsAwesome: working, working, working
she's what made me give up on star wars EU
CrimsonPhoenix: I saw it, I thought that blackgryphon got the real voices, but the post he put there made it seem otherwise
00,02its just titles so meh, i could disable it easy but i'm not gona
i don't live next to any real horses or ponies
Dragonshy and Applebucking?
04I give Lagship Troopers a 6/10
I used to be a HUGE star wars fan
ah
Fight Club, Day After Tomorrow, Applebuck Season, and Dragonshy
unless you count the ones the police ride
like
Spectrum_Rush: I got ice hair, 1 2 3 4 I got Ice Hair.
04Good characters, even if they are archetypes
I'd like to see an episode with the yellow horse and orange horse together.
