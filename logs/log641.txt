There is his minions.
I mean from this
Evelasting_Joy: She even has her own kill count for civilians, eh/
13but the trash compactor bit shortly after where everything slows to a halt to deliver, it's more effective there
now would be a great time to use the BATCLAW, maybe?
I cry easy....

EPIC LINE
13galt's speech is in part three, we don't know yet how faithful they'll be to it if they get that far
objectivist literature drives me batty
thats my gf
SPARKLER
lol
They did try to heckle her
TRY TO FLY TRIXIE, I DARE YOU!
rainbow is a noob, rarity is best
except maybe for the extended cuts of LoTR
how does that even work?
RD isnt That arrogant imo, just a bit overconfident at times
derp count
00,10hurrhuur hurr
DAT RD PUN
you know. Trixie never does beat any of the other ponies skills
you spin me right round baby right round
BAD PUN GAH
but rainbow horse deserves humiliation
irony, +20 points!
she just makes fools of them
that's all it deserves
http://evil-dec0y.deviantart.com/art/Trixie-Vs-Zecora-301409475
00,03Maybe I have been too hard on Trixie... her puns man, her puns...
I have to admit, that scream of Dash is kind of cute.
and throw in a lot of fetish writing
Hey is lotto tonight or tomorrow?
TUSSSLE
Dusty: enope, she just makes them look bad.
unicorn on unicorn action
they totally ignore rarity
lol
It's worth noting that Trixie never actually out preforms anyof the mane6. All she dose is sabotage the opponent.
05,15Meanwhile tonight
13galt's speech really is dense and out of place, skip to the next chapter to continue the plot
toniiiiight
Thanks.
RARITY IS A THUG!!!!!!!
It is on
IT IS ON!
It. Is. ON.

That 3rd person speaking

Shit is now real!

I've only read one Ayn Rand book. Anthem. Kind of an interesting idea, but really over the top
IT IS ON!
IT. IS. OUT OF BATTERIES
I can't watch this
it's painful
derp
i kind of wanted a rap battle to start out of nowhere from this
SMEXY
Trixie's a whore and I hate her.
This episode pissed me off because she refered to herself in the 3rd persone
The battle of the 3rd persons
Just throwing that out.
*pperson

Rarity should have bitch slapped Trixie
STFU SPIKE
*mane
That is one of my favorite of Rarity's outfits.
Sigh.
while i have my disagreement's with Rand's politics, my issue trully lies with her amateurish writing.
GASP
I really hate when you're talking.

Was there ever any doubt~

05,15I did know that
lol
I gotta admit Trixie got a lot of nice quotes
*Snails*
Thank you Grounder
well the difference between an epee and a katana is the difference between a sport and a LARPing group
whether it was a good shake or not, I wouldn't want to drink when it was on his rump
just throwing that out there
why do i get the feeling that they would be kickass at D&D
gettin fked
Dusty: I wouldn't want either of them near my food to be honest.

i'm putting The Terminal for next week
I read the actual play before seeing the movie
05,15I can't settle on an A movie
was dreadfully dull
the last scene is the only good one
13i remember reading the play for english (i think... most of high school blurs together) but never knew there was a movie

Hi all!
the nice thing about this movie
19buffers/10
SCREENCAP/10
is that it's not an allegory
7/7 asses
it has applicability
One thing I think we can all agree on is that the theme song is fucking awesome
Um
This is the only reason.
00,10this has a rifftrax?
oh, movie over already?
13iunno
this movie was designed for buffer
There was a Starship Troopers anime.
00,02it should have a rifftrax

lol OF COURSE he was a Busey
that one actually did have power armor
Oh, and NPH.
LOL :D

00,10yes
Bah.
8/10 Just mindless action with little substance, but that's all you should be looking for in a movie like this.
HE JUST SHOWS UP! When did I ever tell you to listen to him? :D
did anyone screencap that probe buffer shot?
oho foley was used in this
Yes.
This was Starship Troopers wasn't it?

00,02http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/08/friendship-is-magic-comic-pre-orders.html lolcomics
still no Halo movie
Fall wather friends
Here are my thoughts on this movie..........the problem with it wasn't the characters........for the most part. But the inconsistency, followed by it's corniness filled with it's cliches it's only leveled by the FX.----------other than that, it was just a propaganda for the army, with cliche characters included........other than that, it was good mindless entertainment, and a good pick 6.5/10
Fall Weather Friends
There's a Halo OVA.
00,02i think halo could make a good movie
I think Halo would actually work really well in a movie
yeah
13ohh
Halo
"kinda" working on it
13that's why i don't see phase's servers in my favorites
Egoraptor: His name's Benedict. Jon: Well he's "Benedict" to me ever since I've met him! :D

The Guide movie was all right.

/me can never live down the shame
00,02wonder if i could add replay suport

That message from Rarity that Blackgryphon animated....
