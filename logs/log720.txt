This is the first fandom that I've been active in
^
/me bobs head to the song

^^^^
Only 13 eps for S3? :/ Anyone know why?
^^^^^
I am.... a bit MEH with the homestuck fandom
Yay!!!!:3
00,10short seasion is due to contract oblegation
what's withe arrows up?
:'3
00,10they only have to make 65 eps
maybe its because I don't really get into the constant pairings....
And I know thats wrong.
00,10that dont meen they wont make more to contune making a proffit from it
Last thing I kept tabs on in the fandom is Progress
I mean, whats the problem with him for you?
only 65 pony episodes...
damn
3a?
...
I dont like tenticuddles either.
O_o Wut
3a
They said that the reason for only 13 episodes is because kids don't mind reruns
00,1065 eps is the min required for sindication
7days 7hours 55m and 40s
!cd
00,10in othere words once they have 65 eps they can sell rights to show ep to other networks
BOAST BUSTERS
digimon ;3

darkling duck~
00,10they can make more eps if they want

http://cheezburger.com/6619064576
how was yall;s movie night
sadly missed it
it was ok i bet
and also LUNA is best pony
I'm starting to think that why Twilight is winning in best pony polls is because she's the main character.
I'm also against G4 Sea Ponies, to tell the truth
Also: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m39mgfAOGl1rv09a7o1_500.jpg
!cd
it is never a good thing to introduce too many characters into a established show
and the sea ponies would be too much
thats too much http://cheezburger.com/6592252928

Enlighten us.
Ideas are fun .-.
if i had infinite money, i would buy a fairly large iland and all the worlds dirt supply, nuke the rest of the world, then build out my island with the dirt
dat read only mode
no
controlled blasts you see
i have no idea how this equipment works
:D
o noe!
now i'm going to reveal my plan

Eww.
da fuq is wrong with me LD"
:D*
i need to go to sleep, night everyone
00,10Phase should put that roaver in a D.R.O.P
i dropeed?
did i die>
stupid controls are broke
Oh, it's back to normal.
00,10put decoupler on roaver, it's easyer
why am i still here :D
Bye everyone :)
I Know, i need bread :P
I'm gonna take a shower. :P
i'm being thwated
step 1. i get dressed
still bye :P
00,10bugged part perhaps
at least once its done i can just dupe it
00,10personaly i would just use the larger premade roavers
00,10dlip the part?
00,10flip*
like a boss
kinda
00,10dat torque
XD
well the rover made it out
one of its engines went away
00,10got to get a crew to it
00,10they are not attaching
this should be fun
00,10look at part list
awwww
00,10they were not attached
Was using it before ponies existed...
/me shrugs
kinda
i need engines which are gona be a pain
Nah
Rarity <3
CHUGGA CHUGGA WOO WOO.
hmmm
For science!~
should also make those warp clamps
warp clamp needs to be other way round
litter the launch pad with rovers
i'm planing a long misson
hence the individually detachable rovers
Hello all. Who's streaming?
step 3. go to the shops to get unsalted butter, chocolate chips and eggs

Parting in IdleRPG is a bitch
XD
i'm one of the top idlerpg players now
Planning to, actually.
I now have five and a half hours to accomplish.
mica but we like booms
00,10I forsee much ducttape
Since I turn off my computer, I just connect my Android to IdleRPG and leave it there when I need to sleep
00,10ohmy
00,10warp couplers and hard vacume grids
OHMY
Including Victini
00,10do you get fuel flow throught the trusses?
i have no idea
00,10use the doungunt chutes
the which one?
00,10the drop chute
wheres that?
00,10stick it on top
step 5. preheat the oven to 170C, grease the baking tray or line wit parchment
00,10it's a strange one
00,10you need two
00,10keep clear
00,10yep
its anoying that it covers the text
00,10got to use the blocks
i have no idea fi that is right
00,10I would say no
XD
floating rcs
should probably store them that way actually
pretty neat
i try my best to break out the screams there haunting me in my dreams
00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/TxwG17.jpg
that looks cool
00,10the decoupler is optnal
00,10to offset the cluster on the back side
00,10flight
actually, if i'm doing that
00,10basickly you shuttle the long range ship to orbit in many flights
00,10you have no real mission it's just a sandbox
ahh
hmmm
rearange it mid flight
00,10worth a shot
worst it can do is explode
00,10keep in mind you have to be able to man it
00,10else you cant fly it
oh no
/me hides
i have no idea if i'm doing this right
00,10no idea, I only know of the couplers in thiory
00,10btw laser sucks
00,10cant blow up any thing but it's self with it
i'll add to it later
Hmm, where did I hear this song before?...
00,10gonna take alot well other then the hard vacume truses
00,10I would say build somthing more suited as a cargo ship
00,10and haull up parts
00,10yep
00,10this thing i am not even sure can take the stress
00,10that would be cheating
00,10if you are gonna do that just use the unbreakable shuttle parts
yeah, might be a good idea to take the drops up on seperate flights
00,10I would realy like to see a lets play where you build a ship in orbit
where is that...
there it is
00,10but you should be able to launch the base frame as one peice
cant go up without ma mechjeb
00,10ahhh
well... probably, but hopefully it doesnt go evil
00,10uhhhhh
00,10you seem to be lacking bits
YEAH
some of it survived
00,10are those ions?
yeah
00,10ions give shit thrust
lold
i'm not gona bother with kethane just yet
again, more randevus to do that
00,10just use a good old detachable srb set
Lolwut
00,10titan rockets
00,10it's gonna crush it's cones
00,10need launch anchor
oh awesome
5 meter tanks
00,10wut
i need bigger engine
00,10dont we always
mica
there it is
00,10just cover it with scram jets
00,10kinda lazy
00,10it's in read only mode
thats not gona be enough thrust
00,10so uploads are disabled
are you signed in?
00,10yeah
Rubbish
FUCK
00,10read only mode/ service unavable
i get a Http/1.1 Service Unavailable
same
i got that earlier today
just wait it out
xD
http://derpy.me/LxIEK <this very design
00,10lets it it this way, I broke launch anchers with the BFE
it went up too hard
00,10oh you crushed with air restance
no, drops tore it apart
00,10ahhh
00,10time for duct tape
^
this is modded duct tape
00,10model them off the ladders
00,10wobble wobble wobble
00,10she's a bit slow
success!
not enough fuel
00,10also no parachutes
why do i think something worng is gonna happen
mornin y'all
00,10cause he's only 20 ak up and out of fuel
00,10er 30
00,10there go the drops
everythings split apart
yeah
cant get back though
ALL OF THEm.
ships accelerating
00,10how>
00,10shep fell apart
00,10ah I see
00,10your mass managed to carry you up
00,10wait wut
00,10you had 2 C&C?
00,10ahh
00,10no rcs to try and go salvage the drops
nvidia
something
00,10falling?
he i gonna ded
00,10there you go
00,10yep
00,10high G belly flop
huh
00,10must be the warps
maybe
It was nice knowing you Wilsy Kerman.
00,10I feel worse for the dude in orbit
i need more power
more control
00,10better struts on the ions too
00,10did you see all the flex
Tugging of the Strings <3
00,10wont those decouplers get in the way of the warp?
warp clamps are not going to work there
i'm also not sure you can use engines docked via clamp
00,10they were thrusting
00,10saw it at the end
were attached, not docked
00,10ahh
hmm, more engine?
cant really power more engines
00,10need more pannles?
well, needs more power
isn't that...to nuch
much*
you can never have too much power
there is no replacement for displacement
If all else fails, just add more rockets.
its lagging in the vab :(
And duct tape.
00,10still say the central hull has too much flex
probable
00,10when the ions push they flex the truss work in
And if it goes wrong at least you get a spectacular explosion :D
00,10wont let you 4 way eh?
yeah
00,10I realy hate the restrictions in the semitry
i figure
that if i can boost it high enough, i can orbit with the ions
00,10aye
00,10they got any vectoring?
yeah
plenty
00,10looks ready
wont go high enough
need more engine
00,10srb time
wont the engine make it even morey
00,10reactors gonna need a redesgine
yeah
more heavy*
00,10only 4?
00,10there you go
00,10two stacks of that
i could 2 meter tank
neah
nah'
00,10liqued is for upper atmo
00,10need SRB's to get you off the pad
00,10staggr em
ready at 11:24-11:26
00,10cause it is in use
heya everypony

^
ok...nuke the planet...
hit the planet with the station >:3
lol
this is our weapon of last resort...phase...its time...
first pony thing i saw was the first antholgly
I've yet to see anthology
I listen to some ponymusic, and watch the show, read fanfics--but I tend not to watch fanvids-
face the planet...then engage full thrusters...
time to end this...once and for all...
20 minutes till ponies?
For example, shipping
Oh, I prefer Heallthy huge dose of Canon, but- fanon based on canon is very fun
^
Depends on the fic, but in my headcanon, I'm not sure they know eachother
>:3 NUKE THE PLANET...
To me, they don't know eachother
Its all about LunaXDerpy
Aw yes this remix
Not much no
/me shrugs
HOnestly don't know
I see... Hmmm...
:3
wut
got something to show you
wut u want?
TF2 related
orly?
-_- they are JUST friends...
but I think their personalities are different than fanon, in my opinion
They aren't just anything, depends on the fic
Tsssssk
Don't like that
Maybe, I kinda like that angle
O:
dis becoming radio for me, stream to laggy
xD
LUNA...HERE WE COME...
Hehe =3
Wait WAIT
i'ma park this thing in munar orbit
not much use orbiting kerbin
That's impossible
It is?
I recall one scene where they were talking to eachother
I haven't studied them much in the episodes
Ooh
brb
after you land somthing...hit the planet with the station...
Okay- they could very well be friends, yeah. And as I said, I don't mind shipping them, despite prefering male male and female female
nuke it...
end the war...
but- headcanon
aah
And they were faces to eachother and standing still
close enough
Hehe
wat.
She did.
Because it was a sisterhooves social
She has "derpy eyes" when staring at appleblooms loop-de-hoop skills, and are shown with and without horn during that episode... Should be mentioned here?Perhaps Derpy has gone a little to their heads? :)
Derpy eyes might be hereditary :P
hehe
Still...
Maaybe, but as with all bg ponies
nvm...
If I mix, I enjoy that Derpy has a daughter, but age wise, It's kinda...meh
kinda stopped...
none of it is hard-canon, but it is great material for fanon and headcanon
Yeah, I enjoy that she might have a daughter, but I think-- she probably doesn't
BUt... We don't know much about Derpy.
Except that speaking role(HER FIRST VOICE FTW)
hehe
i think i'ma call it a night
We know very little about most
DONT
i meen i got thsi thing into orbit
not only orbit
munar orbit
luna orbit
NUKE THE KERBALS
What's this?

<Southern Valley?
/me looks at list of ponies

Wait, Shoeshine

Nono, Raven
Very strange name, in my opinion, but that was the fanon name apparently
Woot?
*knock* *knock*

<------ Everyone hates those two characters. But I don't.
Well, I didn't read that far
but yeah I did see she was mentioned there

Halo!?

Lolno
NOW.
I remember when everyone was making jokes about Halo, before CoD became a joke
YOLOSWAG?
I'm here to delivar it
dash, go strem
YOLOSWAG
Haters wanna be me.
kk
:3
I am cigarette nao
cause it did
Yeah jokes like that
No thanks
LOl
People would say all sorts of things, exaggerated
Silly dash, cigarettes can't irc
Egoraptor
It was decent, but people made joks about it
around Halo2
2 was still good but not great
but a good one
Halo 3 though oh dear
I never finished Halo2
the only good thing in Halo 3 was the forge
and never played it again
....
pls go
nao
Halo2
i play it for the story
Ooh
Halo^2
I just said Halo 3 was the weaker one of the series really
Hey Everypony! :) It's been awhile
>_>
Noo!
well if you don't count ODST
You have no ladies.
i loved ODST
Halo 3 is high on my Halo list
Fiiine...Maaares then
Right below Halo 1.
Dat shit is da bomb.
I've only tried halo 1 and that was like around 4-5 years ago
with friends on Xbox
I just got my Xbox do I guess I just need to get more games
well
Pfft
You're a chav
u have no opinion

Which is fanart
How're you doing flufffeh
before she was hired
=P
Huzzah for awakening

Though, shouldn't be hard to guess their cutiemarks
:P
Okay...now I'm scared
:O
Yeah..
/me stops
Just don't go any further then that >_>
Not a bad shot at an RTS
wasn't ODST a RTS?
No
oh
LOL?
FPS
wat.
if you pronounce the abbreviation as ARE TEE ESS it should be an RTS
Halo wars could've use a free build system.
Scarabs in Halo Wars

<3
^
Wasn't Forge's superior unit called the "Grizzly" or something?
I can't remeber
oh the anoyance of getting owned by two of them
Something like that
Halo 1/2
1 and 2
other way round

.-.
November 15, 2001 as a launch title for the Xbox gaming system
Wiki it
Oi
I'm not a bastard.

If I see the first episode. And it's good. Then I'll probably get one.
She's mean, frustrated, probably insecure- attractive but--veryyyy abbrasive and angry
Frustratred?
She seems to be-
She clings to RD- and she's kind of- not interested in knowing anyone else
or being friendly to anyone else
Aha
Don't want to break routine.
I can see that
i think she died
Speaking about RAINBOW DASH

gtg, going to see Wreck-It Ralph
Penn and Teller did an episode of Bull**** defending porn from the concerns that they could dispute. It included actual clips of porn.
Oh
Well damn
Oh.
Oh dear anthro

When was he banned?
Noted!
My little Schoogirl
Apple Bloom?
This might not be a pony...
like G4tv
Or not
xP
BANCEPTION
ask him why he left without saying goodbye
November 18th
Ohey, a pony
08,01i'm not sure if anyone complained or not, actually
08,01but it was decided by the admins that he was streaming inappropriate content
08,01so he was banned from streaming for a month
Doll?
08,01DerpyMuffins: from streaming, yes
08,01he can still come in the caht
08,01*chat
Just streaming?
08,01Kandarihu: what's wrong with Eddie Izzard?
Looks like I've picked a good time to avoid the following conversations...
Saturn, I really don't want to go in to it.
whining is disrespectful to the streamer, and we don't do it
08,01Kandarihu: well, it's hardly against the rules to stream transvestite comedy
Brb everypony, gotta reset my router
Okay, i gotta clean my snakes cage, bbl
Good afternoon everypony, how we doing today? :)
latas
That's not ironic though
when we see something we don't like in stream, we don't watch it
08,01Kandarihu: how's that ironic?
be right back everypony, gone to shopping
when something that isn't supposed to be streamed, it is breaching the. Doesn't matter if we complain or not
bye Dark92
bye everypony. Gonna look for mulia Mild fanart
bye Chips
Bye Fri-
gone
buy
oh
There are things that go on, even in that very show, that I need to respond to... come to think of it, I think I had the stream unmuted and was responding to the ideas there as well.
wow
NightHawk64: i think it's going to take a while
saturn: why 9!
Saturn: Define "Monitor".
mkay
xD
I just need another monitor. Currently, I can play in one screen and do everything else in another, but that's not enough.
my computer can only handle 4 monitors at anyone time though
NOTHING AT ALL
I want two monitors when I build my computer
*aren't
I'd help 'monitor' but I'm going to be busy... with writing... possibly all day. -_-
Called it.
08,01AttackWithHugs: get 3
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU
I can't live without two monitors :<
And we won't be able to do squat about it!
some graphics cards only support 2 though! be careful
all this talk about monitors
huh
Because it's smaller than the one when I first moved with my sister
i only have one
:(
Saturn: My room is most definitely not clean <3
Alright back
I only have one monitor too- but I only need one! Honest!
Yup. People joining. Then leaving.
But we go here to get away from the idiots on movie nights. They'll come in here for it and screw it up!
OH wait
Most of them aren
I don't even go here anymore
08,01i moved back in with my parents because i couldn't afford accommodation while at uni, and while i was living else where, they converted my bedroom into a storeroom
Most people aren't on this time of day IIRC.
08,01they never converted it back once i moved back in
!
Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.
Back Sorry About That xP
I could use two, one for DAW one for note's and mixer
but I don't need two
I could use 3 but 2 would be enough for me at the moment
Most of my wall is covered by shelves.
One for IRC, another for stream/other things
people and using walls
i dont have the money for a third
08,01honestly, i've been using just 1 monitor for years now
08,01i used to have 3 monitors
08,01but i've been using a laptop as my main computer for a while
eww
laptop
08,01if i had a desk, i'd set up a second monitor
08,01infernap12: i don't
08,01even though it's a gaming laptop
Yeah, I've been useing my laptop for about 3 years now. I don't even have a mouse.
gasp
08,01i don't like computer games
Hehe
Computer games are for people with spare time.
That reminds me saturn
08,01actually, there are a few games i've enjoyed recently
08,01both of which my laptop runs quite happily
i don't play WoW anymore
I cried.
Python? I've tried that a very long time ago- before properly learning-
ooh
I hear Python is fairly fun.
I've heard good things about Python, and common lisp
Been meaning to start learning it, but goddamn school.
this music
....where is it from?
08,01Vivix: use opengl rather than directx
is it?
i thought this was from the rythom heaven gams
okay- I'll try to get the SDK and such- was kinda hard to navigate
08,01Vivix: http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=2D_using_OpenGL
Oh, thank you!
Don't start with W8 hate.
Ahh
08,01try out Ubuntu; it's really nice
W8 sucks
good thing I just recently upgraded to 7
I'm just saying.
I kinda hope W8 is just a sidestep for touch-stuff
that's because w8's ui is crap
Saturn: I've used Ubuntu for a while now, been wondering if I should switch over to something else.
lol^
08,01DerpyMuffins: not even in a few decades
if I wanted a toy I'd have bought a mac
i actually considered trying ubuntu
08,01infernap12: i don't know; i've never done it before
08,01look for an opengl sdk
08,01DerpyMuffins: i do; it's not without its faults, though
One of the Princesses then, considering the scepter.
08,01Kammerjunk: oh, that's easy; just use ubuntu :P
Distros can be confusing
I only remember the old ones-
but Ubuntu is said to be very simple for linux-noobs
Saturn: I have been for a while on my laptop. Been wondering whether or not I should stick with it.
08,01Kammerjunk: perosnally, i really dislike the Unity interface
oh crap I forgot I was still on here
08,01so i've been using Xubuntu for ages
Saturn: I'm using Ubuntu :P
I've generally preferred Kubuntu, to be honest. But my install on my old computer died a long time ago and I never felt like fixing it.
this accordeon makes me want to play Layton
but people told me not to get it because of Ram hog-
Saturn: Wait, seriously? That's fantastic.
08,01Kammerjunk: aye; they've ported all their Source games, and a *lot* of developers are porting their games too
I am excite.
No surprises there.
08,01Vivix: i think that was just for a dedicated server
08,01DerpyMuffins: no you're not
EILEMONTY DID A COVER OF THE MOON RISES
08,01ekips: not... really
<_<
08,01honestly, there's no real difference between distros

Hello everypony.
Hai
ok I am back... whats the stream?
Ubuntu
I kinda want..Mandrake but--Ubuntu seems to be a standard for users- almost- so--fuk
Nice music, here
Ayejay ayejay ayejay
I'm off until the Euro Movie Night. Cu all l8r
whats superbronys twitter acc called?
And good afternoon, everyone! :)
Remember guys, follow SuperBrony's live EQLA coverage hereL https://twitter.com/ConCrusaders
isn't it Con
Maxthon3
it's built into ubuntu
its ok :P
Yes it's default
Sorry I just prefer Maxthon as my browser
/me is listening to ACDC "Back In Black" currently
I used Kubuntu, and the default browser is Konqueror, which is stil nicer than IE.
Words are incapable of describing the awesome:)
Of course you can switch browser on Ubuntu
I DARE YOU
OH IT'S ON.
wat
???
.....wat
Ubantu is faster right?
In performence
Pinkie Pie O.o
what..just happened?
This is an interesting conversation to walk back into.
All u's darling
Ubuntu
I think it's a little bit faster
WELL
Which is faster?
Oh noo, it is a crazy computer
OS
but neither is slow
I don't think this laptop likes working much anymore... it keeps acting like its crashed once on desktop, but is just loading without response. -_-
Time to start transfering files
Maybe not, I dunno
Just have them both like I do
Any advice for first time users?
no idea
the only reason id switch to 8 would be for the gigantic performance increases
CELUNSTIA, GODDESS OF ALL
I think of it like this: Win7 = XP. Win8 = Vista.
This laptop used to have Vista on it... *shudder*
Right.
Apperance is everything it seems.
I dunno... 95 > 98 seemed to be okay.
The charm bar is just not handy enough
ooh software upgradde
my meal is ready, seeya for Euro Night!
brb, helping my brother
Possibly Win2000.
this song is win
Can you even download Maxthon on ubuntu?
even Ie9 was faster-
isnt this in madoka magica?
Well the piano medley is over. EQLA's opening ceremony is coming up
IE9?
damn right :D
.-.
back
I'm certainly one of them.
win8 isa terrible desicion
Guuyyysss
yup
Pffft
Staaap iiit
I HATE the closed system design
I don't mind closed systems
it --kinda depends
i feel clostrophobic
Wait... that's not a scepter
and trapped
IT'S A TORCH :O
'resource hog' false.
It has a start menu though, I think
'stupid UI' false
no start menu, false.
WB!
there is a start menu, its ust harder to find and works terrible
def no resource hog, lightest, fastest OS yet
lol i see my comments
'Harder to find and works terrible' False.
this charms crap is rediculous
full version is cheap though
It's cheap because MS know it's shite.
It's cheap because they want to sell many
if(windows8_is_good == true) {CW("What?"); }
Lol.
Sales are decreasing.
but for a previous user, its crap
Hi everybody :)
Chryluntadencia... AKA Fausticorn
hi
A lot of people.
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
sales are fine, and offices still prefer computers over any other crap
If sales are fine why are losses beign recorded?
custom is best
custom is pretty solid
I don't think there's a problem
i cant see whats the link for the livestream
a type of computer
they're for social shit and taking pictures
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128
meow
I'm talking market, not actual tech.
WHATS THE LINK FOR THE LIVESTREAM
Computers aren't made for gaming and surfing, that's why they're not tailoring to it
Again, market, not tech.
BUT you can even run ubuntu on smartphones, with monitor and everything
Oh yeah I heard about that
cpomputers ARE made for surfing and gamin
not FOR
what'ss ubuntu again?
lunix
whaere is the livestream vid???!!!
They ported ubuntu on the nexus 7 tablet
Euro movie night starts at 1:59 PM? :I

"I'm gonna cut ya!

In that case its Ham for us in english
handy man
That seems a bit more circumstantial.
3dry-cured ham that is usually thinly sliced and served uncooked
inacceptable!
I also remember having to watch this in school
This is getting really interesting
Depends, prosciutto is a different kind than just regular ham.
Wut?

Yeah, was going to say its not the same ham we are probably not use to in the west
Oh.

....they're giving him the cold shoulder? XD
did they specify his race?
He's Classist <- Not sure this word exist
And it was discovered 20 years later that the kid was guilty... :p
its only ironic that its the 50s USA.
