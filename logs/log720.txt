We'll be doomed.
Now were hating on children who are confused about how fucked up life iis.
That reminds me I need to go vote
SnipsandSnails: Doubt it.
You are the 15th best fandom in my book.
SnipsandSnails: let me guess.. those rumors were invented by you
Thats really high.
Second term Obama scares the pony manure outta me...
You're not bad.
You,re really great.
00,10did you stand up before pulling that number out of your ass?
Test
You just get on my nerves
yay this ^_^
Besides, it's a RUMOR. I'd rather hear it from the staff at the HUB if S3 is the last season.

Nothing much Sumica, just chatting on one of the best websites ever @_@
If I may ask, WHY do hate MIC?
pony_8142: dude. Forget about whats going on, and watch the damn strream. I think you pissed off a few people....OK ALOT
I hope it's not the last season.
A LOT
Wubstep: what you brought? :3
*do you
might wanna forget about this,
Shammy, I've been here, and I've been there.
trust me
pony_8142: I think I know how you feal. Sometimes I hate the Kingdom Hearts fandom, and I'm part of it!
Well let me just join the fandom for awhile.
Even in your underwear.
FlareChaser fair enough
FlareChaser: O U sweet talker U!
Cookies >:3
pony_5506: there are rumours about the season 4 production. nothing confirmed so far
I occasionally let my brony side take over.
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 7 days, 8 hours, 56 minutes, 58 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
Slowly engulfing me.
eddmario: im part of the fandom but... i really dont take much part of it
Lets party.
can i has cookies Wubstep? :3
Thats better Pony
This is the first fandom that I've been active in
^
^^
/me bobs head to the song
^^^
Lets just have a little dance
this and the otaku fandom
Same.
^^^^
Only 13 eps for S3? :/ Anyone know why?
You can has cookie
^^^^^
I am.... a bit MEH with the homestuck fandom
bronies and otakus are the most active folks
Yay!!!!:3
pony_814464: They haven't said.
00,10short seasion is due to contract oblegation
what's withe arrows up?
pony_814464: syndication
:'3
I love this fandom I just dont like mic and It ruined my view of the whole fandom.
00,10they only have to make 65 eps
maybe its because I don't really get into the constant pairings....
And I know thats wrong.
00,10that dont meen they wont make more to contune making a proffit from it
What did Mic do?
Mic the microphone?
Last thing I kept tabs on in the fandom is Progress
I mean, whats the problem with him for you?
only 65 pony episodes...
damn
3a?
...
pony_814464: They said there's a big reason for it. Maybe the episodes are gonna be longer, or there's a movie in the works that they plan on revealing at the end of the season
what happens when they make the 65?
There was some manner of press release that explained that with the toy line doing so well, it was not necessary to spend as much for the TV show to maintain the current rate of sales.
oh i love this guy ^_^
Yay Nostalgia!!!!! :D
I dont like tenticuddles either.
O_o Wut
THIS GUY!
3a
Yes, this video!
They said that the reason for only 13 episodes is because kids don't mind reruns
And I follow some Tumblrs. Discorderly Conduct and Love Letters are silly
well this one will have to be the last video I'll watch with y'all
Guys, this DOES have MLP, but it's the wrong gen for the song
00,1065 eps is the min required for sindication
Why would you let one person ruin your view on this fandom? Instead, you shouldn't let him affect you whatsoever if you didn't want to be.
pony_8142: dude. Why has Mic and Tenti ruined it for you? What about the cloppers. much more belivable (no offense cloppers)
7days 7hours 55m and 40s
AttackWithHugs: i love those lol
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 7 days, 8 hours, 54 minutes, 45 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)

DARKWING DUCK!~
who is this?
00,10they can make more eps if they want
:D
Mic became big and did shit whilst smaller people went unoticed because of him its just the shit that happend with smaller bronies I knew having a domino effect starting from mic and I just dont like mic she said I was stupid onetime. :'(
:D
mic is a he
*tenti
So I beat Assassins Creed III recently.
MIC is a HE.
00,10they probably will but they will have to renegoatie the contracts with the studio and VA's to do so
who are you talking about?
Not a she.
Tenti is a chic.
dont spoil it
>Calls Mic a she
pony_5506: very very very unlikely with the fandom and all....soo they might get another contract or somewhat or sell the rights to another stations to have them sell it or what
Tenticuddles Is an asian female.
>Definitely not a troll
FlareChaser: yeah AC is short lol
FlareChaser: Don'tchu ruin it. Im still working on it.
FlareChaser: no spoilers pls :)

.-.
Oswald was Disney's first main creation- before he started his own studio. It ws fairly popular, but when Disney left to start his own studio, the rights to OSwals stayed behind.
XD
that's a crazy train
That Cow Wears Glasses.
hey, it does!
cartoons sure were different back then
But Disney owns the rights to Oswald now, right? Is that why they put him in Epic Mickey?
I would assume so
Disney owns the rights to the characters-- but none of the actual cartoons.
Wat.

and then he died

good evening everyone :)
pffftt its all aboot Twilight
hello fury
http://cheezburger.com/6619064576
how was yall;s movie night
sadly missed it
it was ok i bet
ILovepinkiePie, OBJECTION, Spike is best pony.
ILovepinkiePie, a lot of bronies would love to see the Sea Ponies in G4, but frankly I think it's less than feasible due to the licensing of G1
Fat kids fat kids, whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
and also LUNA is best pony
I'm starting to think that why Twilight is winning in best pony polls is because she's the main character.
ILovepinkiePie: I hope they will. So the seaponies will have an awesome episode and won't be associated only with SHOO BEE DOO anymore.
I'm also against G4 Sea Ponies, to tell the truth
FlareChaser: run away
objection to the objection AdamTheDuck Crakle is best pony
Also: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m39mgfAOGl1rv09a7o1_500.jpg
Objection to thelonepony's objection to my original objection, Tom is best pony.

You were chosen to choose what species from previous generations are going to come back in G4. There was elimination, and apparently, you can only choose Seaponies or Newborn Cuties. (The newborn cuties was most likely chosen by trolls.) What do you choose?

Kandarihu|Zoro: which one?
thelonepony, I'm glad you asked: all of them
Dont put it out just the name
-_-
Kandarihu|Zoro: isnt it possible that the side rooms have been closed?
Alchemist, of course. I'm not disputing it. I'm just surprised it happened like this.
Kandarihu|Zoro: I havent been to the siderooms ever, I dont know how it's supposed to be closed.
awesome.
moo
Alchemist, it's opened during official event streams. Mainly BMN. During episode streams, the main channel is closed, so that we're all forced to use one of these rooms
Kandarihu|Zoro: I knew that, Im just saying that I dont know if kicking the usual method of closing the side rooms down.
*kicking is
Alchemist, this is the first time it's happened to me.
dammit I keep leaving words out of my sentences.
moo
i got to go evry pony

But all you people could be talking to him... Without knowing just WHO he is... then again he is a moron...

and if meanwhile is here...
Case solve :3

The hoofprints are also invisible! Just in case we run into any Elonian ponies out there, I'm told that Gum Drops has a mark shaped like a pumpkin on his flank." Party Leader: "Is the mark also invisible?" Emissary
of King Thorn of Kryta: "Of course it... Oh yes...right. Never mind."

"any resemblence to 2001 space odessy's discover is purely because this pod is based on it"
indeed
does kerbal spacey progro have multiplauer?

soulero, i wish :(

interesting
soulero, you buy now

soulero, its still in beta, they may add multiplayer
i already buy
if it had Multiplayer.... :D
Phase4: I requested a song ಠ_ಠ
oh yeah
XAX, later
:D
so
i've got idea
Enlighten us.
Ideas are fun .-.
It will Fly damnit!!!!
XAX, problem, this mix is 1 hour long
also i cant switch to the pm tab with your request due to steam notifications
if i had infinite money, i would buy a fairly large iland and all the worlds dirt supply, nuke the rest of the world, then build out my island with the dirt
dat read only mode
Phase4: I'll keep the stream open in the background while I do my bunnyhopping shenanagins in CSS.
until it can habit a full community that i will be ruler of
soulero: doesnt nuking the whole planet affect your tiny island in some trivial way? :D
no
controlled blasts you see
i have no idea how this equipment works
:D
Alchemist yes i can, i have infinite money
o noe!
wind doesnt give a buck about moneyz
now i'm going to reveal my plan
Check your Ponychat tab.
Phase4 did you break the chat again
soulero: if that does happen, try to get the GECK :D
hey whats being built?
A Ship to he... to space >_>
Alchemist i will make a mile wide wall of lead around my island
RDLovesPi, the weapon of mass murder of the Kerbal rance.
race*
^^:D
garry's mod?
yes <_<
and by wide i mean thick
server?
thelonepony: when I was a kid I always wondered what kind of equipment can fit into a simple briefcase that can produce towns :D
RDLovesPi, the game is called Kerbal Space Program
i'll go search that now
hell, ill just get 100s of 1000s of helicopters to coat the rest of the world in molten lead
Alchemist: Now You know :D
and knowing is half the battle :P
Alchemist what do you think of my plans?
soulero: implying there are enough helicopters and lead to go around to do that.
dads asking me to google stuff
Hi Phase4 Dad
ripstiks? .-.
Alchemist you are failing to understand that i have infinite money#
XD
Phase4 is your dad called Phase3
soulero, you have all the dosh? .-.
yes
soulero, i call him dad
soulero: you fail to understand that if there is a finite amount of lead, no matter how much money you throw at it, it wont multiply.
no your wrong Phase4 he is called phase3
XD
Alchemist: i jus get scientists to make more lead
Morning, everybrony.
no soulero its Phase1
Mornin' Malavolent
Hes the first one :3
no its not, otherwise there would be no phase 3 or 2
Hi Malavolent :)
this is the 'phase looks for parts' stream
And in a steampunk alternative universe Phase4's dad will be Phase the Third.
/me gives Malavolent :3
soulero: and realistically even if they could do that you'd be long gone before there was enough lead.
XD
gives a hug*
phase2 is grandparents, phase1 is great grandparents
Eww.
da fuq is wrong with me LD"
:D*
soulero: even science takes time, no matter how much money you pump into it.
phase0 is what we evolfved from

00,10btw Phase4, the Drop pods are not ballenced for that direction of travle
00,10they are heavy on the door side
mica but we like booms
that better?
when pinkie was a little filly and the sun was going doooaaooowwnn]
00,10well it's up to you Phase4, was just leting you know they are
00,10I stuck 4 chuts on the side of one and droped it to test
Sumica, the more help the better, this is gona be hard to get into space
Phase4: can it do a barrel roll?
00,10I forsee much ducttape
Colt_Silver, i have no idea
00,10and hal laughing his cerkets off
Since I turn off my computer, I just connect my Android to IdleRPG and leave it there when I need to sleep
Spell-of-Gaming whats idlerpg
00,10ohmy
Phase4 puts the rocket together LIKE A BOSS
00,10btw gonna be a silly space station
its gona be a test station
00,10warp couplers and hard vacume grids
OHMY
My McDonalds have Pokemon 5th Gen toys now
Including Victini
IM BACK! with the eggs, choco chips and butttah
00,10do you get fuel flow throught the trusses?
i have no idea
00,10use the doungunt chutes
the which one?
00,10the drop chute
wheres that?
oh i c
00,10stick it on top
step 5. preheat the oven to 170C, grease the baking tray or line wit parchment
00,10it's a strange one
00,10you need two
00,10they deploy where it says danger
00,10keep clear
ah
so thats why theres 3 points on the drop
00,10the whol top of the ring blows off
00,10yep
its anoying that it covers the text
Sumica, does it have its own rcs or just use the stock blocks?
00,10there is also an sas desgined to fit in side the ring with the rcs pods
00,10got to use the blocks
i have no idea fi that is right
00,10I would say no
00,10should only need the one ring
00,10let me fire mine up and screen snap
XD
floating rcs
Phase4: Awoken by WoodenToaster? :D
what game is this?
Nofosos, Kerbal Space Program
should probably store them that way actually
pretty neat
i try my best to break out the screams there haunting me in my dreams
00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/TxwG17.jpg
Ah
00,10that's an asas in the middle of the ring
that looks cool
00,10the decoupler is optnal
00,10but you need it if you have the cluster on the door side
00,10that's why it's door heavy
00,10to offset the cluster on the back side
ah
00,10so no reactor on this?
00,10gonna go solar?
its bloody heavy
figure i'll deal with solar
00,10yeah for what I saw the best way to go reactor is to use warp couplers
hey night yall see yall in the mornings ok and thanks for the stream phase4 your great dude
00,10boos the reactor to orbit with a diffrent glight
Goodnight Moopy
Sumica, that seems like an ok way to do it
00,10flight
actually, if i'm doing that
00,10basickly you shuttle the long range ship to orbit in many flights
i never asked, what the mission here?
infernap12, get this thing to space
once i know the problems, build a bigger one and fly it around the solar system
00,10you have no real mission it's just a sandbox
are we landing on a planet or the mun or what?
infernap12, the mission is to find the most creative way to kill off your Kerbinaughts.
00,10he's building a deep space flight
ahh
hmmm
Sumica, think i could make the engines detatchable and have a 'space tug'?
00,10so right now it's mostly, can I get this much crap in to space
rearange it mid flight
00,10worth a shot
worst it can do is explode
00,10keep in mind you have to be able to man it
00,10else you cant fly it
00,10so you will need some kind of portaable C&C
oh no
i sorta made it in the nightly round up
/me hides
i have no idea if i'm doing this right
00,10no idea, I only know of the couplers in thiory
00,10btw laser sucks
00,10cant blow up any thing but it's self with it
that looks like an ok space station
i'll add to it later
Hmm, where did I hear this song before?...
00,10gonna take alot well other then the hard vacume truses
Mind if you link the song Phase4?
Phase4 ahhh
AdamTheDuck, not really but i'm concentrating on the craft today
Sumica, i have no idea how to get this to space XD
Phase4 me name be in eqd
JRP2234, ?
00,10I would say build somthing more suited as a cargo ship
00,10and haull up parts
gona be funny if i get to space and the clamps are all wrong
Sumica, but then theres a lot of randevus to do
also i can't spell french
00,10yep
00,10this thing i am not even sure can take the stress
00,10thoes drops are heavy as fuck
wonder if i could get the orbital build hack thing
00,10that would be cheating
true
00,10if you are gonna do that just use the unbreakable shuttle parts
yeah, might be a good idea to take the drops up on seperate flights
00,10I would realy like to see a lets play where you build a ship in orbit
where is that...
there it is
00,10but you should be able to launch the base frame as one peice
cant go up without ma mechjeb
00,10the hell is that?
00,10is that like a hal?
Sumica, really good mod, adds a lot of info to the game that you kinda need
00,10ahhh
well... probably, but hopefully it doesnt go evil
TO SPACE!
00,10uhhhhh
00,10you seem to be lacking bits
YEAH
SPACE
some of it survived
00,10are those ions?
yeah
00,10ions give shit thrust
lold
i'm not gona bother with kethane just yet
again, more randevus to do that
00,10just use a good old detachable srb set
00,10Ions are ment for in space only
00,10and make sure you use a launch anchor so you dont fall over on the pad
00,10oh god
Lolwut
00,10titan rockets
this will explode
There's an article on WikiHow
"Find Your Dad for Free"
00,10it's gonna crush it's cones
00,10need launch anchor
oh awesome
5 meter tanks
00,10wut
00,10dear god
i need bigger engine
00,10dont we always
mica
there it is
00,10just cover it with scram jets
00,10kinda lazy
click upload on youtube mica and tell me if you get a error message
00,10it's in read only mode
thats not gona be enough thrust
00,10so uploads are disabled
what
are you signed in?
00,10yeah
FUCK YOU YOUTUBE THE ONE TIME I REALLY NEED TO UPLOAD
Rubbish
00,10use 4 of those Phase4
00,10the big ones
these big engines cause lag
mica try and accese your account settings
jrp: service unavailable
FUCK
00,10read only mode/ service unavable
i get a Http/1.1 Service Unavailable
same
i got that earlier today
just wait it out
maby its switching to the new youtube design
00,10you should get the BFE mod then Phase4
xD
that would get something to space
00,10you know the 60m rocket nozzle
00,10you could put the whole launch platform in to space with it
http://derpy.me/LxIEK <this very design
why cant use just use some srb s?
00,10lets it it this way, I broke launch anchers with the BFE
00,10so what happend?
it went up too hard
Good morning Bronystate! :$
00,10oh you crushed with air restance
mornin MadSurge
no, drops tore it apart
00,10ahhh
00,10time for duct tape
^
Mornin' MadSurge
what is this game?
this is modded duct tape
stronger than original
BroHoof, kerbal space program
Phase4: ah
00,10nice thing about tapeing from the fuel tanks is the duct tape goes away when you jet the tank
00,10they realy should make the solar pannles deployable
00,10model them off the ladders
00,10wobble wobble wobble
00,10she's a bit slow
success!
Phase4: Can we get dat Awoken later? D:
Hooray, Kerbal killing time! :D
not enough fuel
00,10also no parachutes
camera bug
why do i think something worng is gonna happen
mornin y'all
Ohai diddutz!
00,10cause he's only 20 ak up and out of fuel
mornin' diddutz
00,10er 30
00,10there go the drops
everythings split apart
Hello diddutz
00,10strange camera bug
00,10try the tracking center Phase4
hi MadSurge, BroHoof and AdamTheDuck. How many kerbaly have you seen dieing today? ^^
00,10might be able to lock the camera back on
diddutz, all the innocent kerbals.
yeah
cant get back though
ALL OF THEm.
ships accelerating
00,10how>
bug
diddutz: i only saw 3 dead i was here late :C
00,10shep fell apart
that would scary as all hell
00,10ah I see
00,10your mass managed to carry you up
00,10wait wut
00,10you had 2 C&C?
space crew space
00,10ahh
00,10no rcs to try and go salvage the drops
what kind of graphics card do you have phase4 ?
why did this bug so hard
nvidia
something
00,10falling?
he i gonna ded
00,10there you go
too late either way
00,10yep
00,10but that was what I was saying to try earlyer
inb4 crash? .-.
00,10high G belly flop
huh
and then camera bug again
00,10must be the warps
maybe
It was nice knowing you Wilsy Kerman.
00,10I feel worse for the dude in orbit
so
perfect music
i need more power
more control
and less camera bug
Phase4... There's always room for more power.
00,10better struts on the ions too
00,10did you see all the flex
Tugging of the Strings <3
Oh God this was one of my first few Octavia inspired songs
Well, MLP inspired
00,10wont those decouplers get in the way of the warp?
warp clamps are not going to work there
i'm also not sure you can use engines docked via clamp
00,10they were thrusting
00,10saw it at the end
were attached, not docked
00,10ahh
hmm, more engine?
cant really power more engines
00,10need more pannles?
well, needs more power
isn't that...to nuch
much*
you can never have too much power
BroHoof, there is never too much engine.
AdamTheDuck, you make a good point there
there is no replacement for displacement
If all else fails, just add more rockets.
its lagging in the vab :(
And duct tape.
00,10still say the central hull has too much flex
probable
press forward, Phase, nothing can go wrong
00,10when the ions push they flex the truss work in
And if it goes wrong at least you get a spectacular explosion :D
00,10wont let you 4 way eh?
yeah
00,10I realy hate the restrictions in the semitry
i figure
that if i can boost it high enough, i can orbit with the ions
00,10aye
00,10they got any vectoring?
yeah
plenty
its that camera bug that scares me
I am ready to cue up Hope Vol 2 to play under when you launch this
00,10looks ready
wont go high enough
too heavy
need more engine
00,10srb time
a reactor might be a good idea actually
wont the engine make it even morey
00,10reactors gonna need a redesgine
ah well
yeah
more heavy*
BroHoof, more fuel too
Phase4, ah yea that's true
00,10just bolt a couple dozen srb's on it
00,10only 4?
00,10there you go
wanted to put more liquid on but meh
00,10two stacks of that
i could 2 meter tank
neah
nah'
00,10liqued is for upper atmo
damn ._. what are those
00,10need SRB's to get you off the pad
ze cookies are baking
00,10staggr em
00,10it's dead weight unlles they ar burning
ready at 11:24-11:26
Sumica, not enough space, have to stage them either way
i cant get on my L_Y_R_A profile for some reason...when i tried to log in it said "this name is in use"
alt_L_Y_R_A, use the ghost command
this is gona lag soo hard
00,10cause it is in use
eqd better post my thingy
ghost?
heya everypony
/ns ghost username password

ok...
/me licks Phase4 "Thanks." :P
thx :P
00,10and now you know how to ghost
YOUTUBE WORK NOW
oh damn

seems ready enough
Ahh I take it this is a good 'ol Phase4 Stream?
0_0
inb4 EXPLOSIONS
>.< Turns out I already had this song downloaded >.>
DAAAAAAAAAMN...thats one big ship...
OH GOD LAG
/me licks TheRandomkid321 again :P
/me Licks AdamThe... SONOFA
Yay explosions \:3/
So this time he is attenptiing to launch a sattelite?
huh
its not loading
There we go
lol the explosion is too awesome to load
dat Framerate
Epic music for an epic occasion.
yep :P
uber lag
00,10they over did the particals on those boosters
BroHoof Never seen you on before.
FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU
TheRandomkid321, i'm on almost every day..almost
camera bug again
/me watches Phase4 flip table
OH DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
Phase4: How did you manage to break your altmeter? O.o
epic lag
THE MUSIC...THE GAME...SOO...INTENCE...
BroHoof Did you change your name? I swear to clestia i've never seen you on before... sorry... just for reasons previously expained I am being cautios of newcomers.
was that makkon?
Dark_Horst, eeyup
TheRandomkid321, it might be just timezone differances .-.
TheRandomkid321, no no it's alright i didn't change my name tho and i've been in bronystate for more than 4 moths i think
Hey now Earth ahs more textures on it... they should add cities to the game so you can crash into them >:D
the kerbals are spazzing out XD
lost one of the drops
why did that kerbal hit the panic button?
So Phase4 May I request some music perhaps maybe ^_^?
now THAT...is a satilite...
TheRandomkid321, dont really want to do requests tonight
Kay
man these are some weird ass cookies
thats no satillite, thats a space station
they became giant and are merging into a supercookie
i might have to dissect them back into induvidual cookies
you monster
havnet gont long
got'
mutilating cookies? how dare you?
its for them, now me
*not
they will be freaks if i dont... perfect them....
I'm sick of my mate bucking all my games up. Skyrim, fallout NV, and Fallout 3 he has gone on a massive killing spree. And on Xcom he killed all my soldiers and made so many countries drop out I got Game Over!
hey guys
hi alexxm :)
Ohai alexxm
hey alexxm
00,10got to open the hatch
lol whut
i did
yes, they, they must be edited
how've you been Alchemist AdamTheDuck and BroHoof
i will take a picture to show the result
alexxm, pretty good, how bout u?
i'm good BroHoof
alexxm: been better, procastrinating like a boss. You?
good here Alchemist what happened to you
alexxm, been fine doing nothing productive all day. :$
how are things alexxm?
TheRandomkid321, I'M DEAD? D:
Nuuuuuuu
alexxm: nothing serious really :D I just have a ton of work I need to finish this weekend and I dont want to deal with it right now.
hey guys anyone got xboxlive?
homework, homework everywhere
expected this to be easier
if it was only homework I would be fine
right
guys I'm gonna draw a bit
ping me if I'm nedded ;)
needed*
>_>
AdamTheDuck yeeeaaahhh about that... you see there was an incedent involving rocketlaunchers, explosives, and a very poor choice of cover on my behalf... You survived... no missions... happened a few weeks ago actually.
Sonny sure thing shut be sure to show us the drawing ;P
Sonny, just* ._.
the operation will begin in 2 minutes
BroHoof: I always upload them on my da page
I could send you the link if you want me to?
i have administered the anesthetic
Sonny sure
right hold on
might have to ditch it
alright
Sonny you are needed at the HQ asap we need someone to man the friendship cannon manually until the computer is fixed...
Dregs of a bitter cup!
knew i heard it somehwere
the operation was a success
moin everypony
this camera bug
i cant control my craft
the conjioned septuplets have been seperated
gona have to ignore the drop
save the station
solar cells are producing nothing
out of energy
:(
i see a dead kerbal
Mornin' Invi
total misson failure
Why chat so ded? :<
looks like i need the reactor
solar cells dont work
Phase4: which mod is that?
which meens more weight, redisign
Dark_Horst, deep space mod
AdamTheDuck Cause saturday and morning/just about afternoon for us EU folks and over midnight for US guys
Pfft sleep is for the weak.
it is 6:40 here, 7:40 east coast time in the us
hello!
Hmm also what i haven't seen much activity from the PS2 outfit for a while now
Ohai PVTparasprite
i dont know if i can make this work
ohai
killerpony7733, I was playing earlier
AdamTheDuck Ah well i am not on all the time but when i am i haven't seen any on
*turns on sound* heck yeah! makkon!
i'ma brb
think about this
this craft is dificult
and so are spelling
Think i'ma go play a bit too i'm all home alone for today and a bit tommorrow and i have a ton of time
put the four yellow balls and parachute on anything that will return to the planet...it will help...ALOT...
what song of makkon is this again?
Phase4: got kreuzing'S electricity pack?

Dark_Horst, afaik no
PVTparasprite, /)
(\
PVTparasprite, Deae Lunae
pictures and details concerning the cookie septuplets seperation will be posted shortly.
ah! i knew it!
Phase4: deep space mod says you need it. that's probably why the solar cells dont work
Dark_Horst, thing is energy works, batterys drain, and so on
that'S weird
im gonna mute the sound again, ive been listining to makkon a crapload sinse ac3 came out
and i need my daily dose of wubs
one more try
one more one more try

That's one mammoth rocket there
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Uuuuum
hmmmm
OH NO
YAY
there is a slight lag problem
wait...dont launch yet...
?
like...5 seconds after the enfines start blowing...release the support beams...
*engines
might work...
the issue here is extreem lag
:/
Phase4: This current song was my menu music on CSS for a while

NUKE THE PLANET

wat
car

WELL
damn
Yay Flutterwonder! :3
YES...FLUTTERWOUNDER...HELL YEAH!!!!!!!11111!!!!!!!!!ONE1!!!!!!1
^
DEEP WIDE BELL WONDER
ok...nuke the planet...
Flutterwonder, the first good ponysong I heard
what a wonderful world
hit the planet with the station >:3
I got a sinking feeling about this Phase4
Phase4 im sorta on the nightly roundup at eqd
i've almost perfected it
Flutterwonder, the reason why i started watching ponies
lol
DerpyMuffins, i think the parachutes exploded cause of the time warp
so might be able to do that
JRP2234, neat
this is our weapon of last resort...phase...its time...
first pony thing i saw was the first antholgly
I've yet to see anthology
I listen to some ponymusic, and watch the show, read fanfics--but I tend not to watch fanvids-
Vivix: Canon, Fanon, or mix?
face the planet...then engage full thrusters...
time to end this...once and for all...
Wait, Vivix? As in the ShizukaXVivi?
condor seems to be having a breakdown down there
Vordox in fanfics? Mix
20 minutes till ponies?
Oh nono, I'm not vivi
Vivix: I meant you :P
Wha ha ;__;?
Vivix: Are you a canon or fanon or mix(What feels the best)
For example, shipping
Oh, I prefer Heallthy huge dose of Canon, but- fanon based on canon is very fun
Major shipper
^
Vivix: Octavia and Vinyl, what's their relation?
Depends on the fic, but in my headcanon, I'm not sure they know eachother
>:3 NUKE THE PLANET...
Vivix: Interesting....
Dr Whooves and Derpy?
university days?
My bigggest difference from typical fanon is bon bon and lyra
Dr Whooves is time turner to me-
Vivix: Friends, or more? :P
DrXDerpy will never happen
To me, they don't know eachother
So, no pure fanon?
Its all about LunaXDerpy
Aw yes this remix
Not much no
I love this one <3
but it really depends, I can enjoy Derpyx TimeTurner, but- it's not my headcanon
bon bon X lyra will never happen...
Vivix: Derpy and Dinky?
/me shrugs
HOnestly don't know
I see... Hmmm...
oi DashWithRainbows
but Bon bon and Lyra I consider near canon- as friends at least
oh Vivix is on
:3
wut
Vivix: iiiiinteresting!
got something to show you
wut u want?
TF2 related
orly?
We see them so many times, exchanging conversation, or carrying eachothers things-
Sup DashWithRainbows
-_- they are JUST friends...
but I think their personalities are different than fanon, in my opinion
Sweet justice.
They aren't just anything, depends on the fic
Tsssssk
Vivix: Lyra +Hand Craze? :P
Don't like that
ohai Ponies47
LYRA AND BON BON ARE JUST FRIENDS...END...OF...STORY...
To me they're--maybe 24 ish, young, Bon bon has no steady employment, both are cultured and bon bon is a bit of a bitch-
Scootaloo is an orphan?
Maybe, I kinda like that angle
You're an orphan Vordox.
Jmo: Technically, I'm half orphan
but--no canon on it, so just maybe
But nevermind =P
O:
What about...
Luna + Pipsqueak?
Well, they know about eachother- and Pipsqueak think's Luna is awesome
dis becoming radio for me, stream to laggy
xD
LUNA...HERE WE COME...
Hehe =3
What about....
Wait WAIT
i'ma park this thing in munar orbit
You said something about Derpy and Whooves not knowing eachoother?
not much use orbiting kerbin
That's impossible
It is?
I recall one scene where they were talking to eachother
I haven't studied them much in the episodes
Ooh
brb
after you land somthing...hit the planet with the station...
Okay- they could very well be friends, yeah. And as I said, I don't mind shipping them, despite prefering male male and female female
nuke it...
end the war...
but- headcanon
Vivix: He reappears in Apple Bloom's imagination while running around in a panic, as well as in three village shots, once standing next to an unknown stallion and twice standing next to Derpy on the bridge
aah
They could be a couple- if Dinky is her daughter
And they were faces to eachother and standing still
close enough
Vivix: Don't go toof ar. :P
Hehe
wat.
but Dinky- I can't remember who she ran with in sisterhooves, if she did
She did.
but like Pinchy, I think she's more likely to be Berry's sister than her daughter
Because it was a sisterhooves social
Vivix: Dinky is also with Amethyst Star in Sisterhooves Social. The two of them compete in the titular Sisterhooves Social.
hey Phase4 are you streaming? :p
Ryunosuke, yeah
Hm- so we could say they migh be sisters BUT Sweetie ran with 'Applejack'
ah
so, they could just be friendly
yellow?...or gala?...
You know what's interesting Vivix ...
She has "derpy eyes" when staring at appleblooms loop-de-hoop skills, and are shown with and without horn during that episode... Should be mentioned here?Perhaps Derpy has gone a little to their heads? :)
Derpy eyes might be hereditary :P
hehe
Still...
HELL HEAH PIRATES OF CARIBEAN
Maaybe, but as with all bg ponies
nvm...
it can be hard to determine what is what
If I mix, I enjoy that Derpy has a daughter, but age wise, It's kinda...meh
kinda stopped...
i love the imposibly circular orbits mechjeb can get
none of it is hard-canon, but it is great material for fanon and headcanon
Yeah, I enjoy that she might have a daughter, but I think-- she probably doesn't
Vivix: Sisters are fine, lorewise and Fanon.
BUt... We don't know much about Derpy.
XD wonder if mechjeb could land this thing
Except that speaking role(HER FIRST VOICE FTW)
hehe
i think i'ma call it a night
We know very little about most
Alright Phase4 night
DONT
i meen i got thsi thing into orbit
not only orbit
the one we kinda can glean a lot of personality from is Bon bon, and any of the others who have spoken
munar orbit
CRASH INTO THE PLANET FIRST
Phase, some friends played that before
luna orbit
L_Y_R_A, crashing doesnt do much
NUKE THE KERBALS
We accidently made the pilots fly out of the galaxy to never return
Vivix: And don't forgot ONE particular hated pony
Vivix: The Southern Valley one
What's this?
:)
<Southern Valley?
SnipsandSnails, kerbal space program
Surf n Turf?
/me looks at list of ponies
Vivix: The girl who is "modern" girl. :P
back!
:D
wb sonny :D
thanks ^^
Vivix: The one with.. I think it was, Fluttershy's episode, with Flutterbitch
oh yeah
Lyra :(
yeah Surf and Turf
say, did sombody with the name klalaskaxD or somthing like that came along recently?
Turf I think is the one with palm cutiemark
ive hated more...
In that episode we get to know bon bon a little more too
who's surf and turf?
Vivix: Wait, you already know Surf and Turf
XD
well did there?
hu?
http://askpun.tumblr.com/post/34491190251/ -- hehe
the two ponies tell Fluttershy to get a life
Vivix: Didn't knew you also trying to remember all bg ponies
I thought they were fun so I looked them up- I like bg ponies
did stream end?
Stream ded
Cherry Berry is the mare Bon Bon is talking to- the one trying to get into showbiz
Vivix: Welcome to the crowd who does. :D
hehe
okkkkaaayyyy... since everypony is ignoring me nvm :p
Or wait- it's not cherry?
Vivix: http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Cherry_Berry
/me slaps Vivix
GOD DAMN IT.
You're a disappointment.
hai
http://tinyurl.com/ctwg4lr
>.>
oh yeah...surf and turf...those two bitches who told Fluttershy to get a life
Wrong irc
19	At Iron Will's place, On the bridge with Bonbon, in the line
/me hugs Jmo
I know
Sometimes I wonder why I bother with you.
hehe
test
hay nitt
Vivix: Who is Shoeshine then? :P
Ooh I can't tell without cheating ;__; but I've seen the name
11,01Hey Havok.
but looking at her image-
Vivix: Who hasn't seen the names. XD
Vordox, Shoeshine is Shoeshine
What do i win?
Ponies47: d'aaahww D:
Shoeshine http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VgGR5SItGIM/T2qyM3J02oI/AAAAAAAAIJg/OPrzj8eiqK4/s1600/UNDERDOG%2BSHOESHINE%2BBOY%2BCOIN%2BBITE.jpg
Did she cut in line infront of Fluttershy?
Jmo: Where does she has a speaking rol? :P
Vivix: eyup
Woo
She was cute-
but I never noticed her before then
be more specific fool ;__;
Sonny: :<
Sweetie Belle is so cute :>
^
brb
Vivix: She has 4 speaing roles
Which is ALOT for a BG pony
Name ONE
Really? Yeah that is a lot-
okay
Raven!
Raven?O.o
My headcanon on her is totally based on nothing,
and I just recently learned her name
...and Sumi overslept again
Wait, Shoeshine
wha?
knock knock
is the stream still on
Nono, Raven
Very strange name, in my opinion, but that was the fanon name apparently
Woot?
*knock* *knock*
In my head she's Mayor Mare's assistant, Just because she was sitting next to her-
Vivix: Er...
Vivix: I think she got her name in the upcoming S3
=P
<------ Everyone hates those two characters. But I don't.
So I can't dvelwe deep here
Well, I didn't read that far
but yeah I did see she was mentioned there
SnipsandSnails: I don't hate them, at all. They add some hasty kids :P
back
Vivix: Oh wait, she hasn't gotten it.
I'm not a fan of them, but- I don't hate them
BUt yeah, Raven. :P Isn't she familiar to someone else too.. as ec
SnipsandSnails: I was once 5 feet away from the guy who voices Snips
hehe
She does look like eh..that political woman
is there something wrong with the stream or is it just me?
oh, phase done?
hmmm...interesting...
Is Sumica here? Just came on late and since the stream's blank I thought he wasn't here
Or did Sumi ninja the stream and we're having problems?
i belive its something like 5 am where sumica
is
The guy that voices Snails is the same guy that voices Inuyasha
I think my favourite-- bg pony design might be Amethyst Star, but it might be because of her voice and colour-scheme
J_E_Smith71: Phase4 was streaming before and then he just stopped all of a sudden :/
is the stream on?
oh
nvm
>_>
Ponies47 infernap12: yeah but Sumi's supposed to be running pony eps now
Vivix: My favourite BG Pony
Applejack
mines Pinkie Pie
Hehe
mine's*
Either Derpy or Vinyl.
J_E_Smith71: He is? Oh maybe that's why. Mabye Sumi is just setting up or something
My favorite is Twilight Sparkle
hehe, can't wait for the sudden high traffic next friday
I dunno- I don't really count Derpy when I think abo that, dunno why
<3 TWILY
Dragon Quest is playing on TV right now.
my favourite BG pony is probably Amethyst or Rose- those two have hte prettiest colours
Ponies47: Yeah but it's live off the Hub, so we're missing the ep
Amethyst?
But best background pony is :P
Amethyst Star
J_E_Smith71: Oh yeah *Sadface*
...hey all
pony who was opening jar of..pickles on picnic
vinyl scratch by far, she just looks too awesome
oh, that purple one
Hey shadowboy8456
Ponies47: Wait what?
I dunno- her fanon kinda made me not enjoy her as much
Dark92Enigma: ?
Hayseed TurnipTruck
but she does look badass
/me win pose
what;s the question?
Ponies47: you were talking with J_E_Smith71 about the Hub
lol AJIsAwesome|Asleep how can he have typed that when he is asleep xD
Vivix: Who?
Vordox those cards that were CaD?
Is it just me or is stream dead?
Vordox Vinyl
Vivix: Ah. :P A second
dtream is dead
stram
Dken2021: CaD? I think they were official
Enterplay cards? Those are great
damn
there were some CaD cards, but no not those
Dark92Enigma: Sumi's supposed to stream the pony reruns right now but he's not here. Must have had problems or he overslpet again
which cards are you talking about?
Enterplay?
Dark92Enigma: I guess Sumi was going stream pony episodes live from the Hub.
Isn't DST out of effect?
by the way, i'm working on my Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus

Go to your room.
There's going to be one week left full
Fuk u mom!
Vivix: Read the whole 3 page series? :P

Badass derpy
Oi mister, you watch your mouth.
Pfft, you can have your stoopid ponies
I'll have mah Halo 4.
DWR pls go.
Halo!?
^
pls go.
:3
Lolno
NOW.
This place needs more SWAG
I remember when everyone was making jokes about Halo, before CoD became a joke
YOLOSWAG?
I'm here to delivar it
SWAG is for FAGS
what is it with dolan and broken grammar?
/me sucks dick
dash, go strem
YOLOSWAG
Haters wanna be me.
SWAG is for cigarettes?
kk
Vivix, you mean how Halo invented FPS?
:3
I am cigarette nao
cause it did
Yeah jokes like that
HavokOC Me? Stream?
Might I ask what Halo is?
No thanks
SWAG = Secretly We Are Gay
LOl
People would say all sorts of things, exaggerated
Silly dash, cigarettes can't irc
DerpyMuffins he's a pretty cool guy
like that--video where people smash Halo and snort it
Also Vivix that's because Halo was actually decent
oh god
Egoraptor
It was decent, but people made joks about it
around Halo2
2 was still good but not great
DerpyMuffins A CoD ripoff
but a good one
Halo 3 though oh dear
I never finished Halo2
the only good thing in Halo 3 was the forge
and never played it again
....
Your space bar is broken Vivix.
CrimsonPhoenix
pls go
nao
I haven't played Halo I don't play video games that much
It is Jmo? ;__;
Halo2
i dont play halo for game
There is a space.
i play it for the story
Ooh
Halo^2
I just said Halo 3 was the weaker one of the series really
Hey Everypony! :) It's been awhile
>_>
Yeah, no, CrimsonPhoenix.
I will hurt your goaticorns Vivix.
Noo!
You obviously didn't play ODST
well if you don't count ODST
They're my lovely ladies ;__;
Hai DerpDash :)
You have no ladies.
i loved ODST
Halo 3 is high on my Halo list
Fiiine...Maaares then
what of it
Right below Halo 1.
Can't beat the classic
I don't count it because that cannot be a legitimate Halo game in my book
wut about Flash Halo DWR
I only ever played the MP
Dat shit is da bomb.
I've only tried halo 1 and that was like around 4-5 years ago
with friends on Xbox
I just got my Xbox do I guess I just need to get more games
Morning.
/me huggles AttackWithHugs
Morning :3
mornin AttackWithHugs :3
If you have a good gaming PC, you don't need a console
Also DashWithRainbows my opinion is totaly and definitely better than yours
well
hai AttackWithHugs :3
Pfft
You're a chav
u have no opinion
:>
OH MY GOD
The "Cutie Mark Crusaders Chocolate Popcorn" recipe's accompanying illustration depicts grown-up versions of the Cutie Mark Crusaders with cutie marks,
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Red Dead Redemption is the only game I have right now
Which is fanart
Hi Jmo, Dken2021, and Colt_Brovakiin4
Vordox, it was just fanart-
How're you doing flufffeh
Vivix: It's made by ONE of the creator of the show
before she was hired
=P
no, it was made by an animator
Jmo, just waking up.
who was hired after drawing the picture
Huzzah for awakening
it's not considered canon because of it
Though, shouldn't be hard to guess their cutiemarks
Vivix: awww
McDonald's of Germany held a contest in early 2012, titled "Mein Burger 2012", asking customers to create and name their own sandwich. One of the sandwiches that made the finals is called "Scootaloo", a chicken sandwich, named by its creator after the character from the series
:P
Guess what? They're never gonna get one.
Okay...now I'm scared
Eating Scootaloo..not quite what I imagined
:O
DashWithRainbows, but seriously though our opinions and etc, I do agree with you that ODST is really the biggest joke of the series, I've actually forgot about it
Vivix, stop right there.
Yeah..
/me stops
Just don't go any further then that >_>
Halo wars was a better game than ODST
Not a bad shot at an RTS
wasn't ODST a RTS?
No
oh
LOL?
FPS
wat.
DashWithRainbows, for concoles
if you pronounce the abbreviation as ARE TEE ESS it should be an RTS
Halo wars could've use a free build system.
Scarabs in Halo Wars
,3
<3
^
Oh the joy of wrecking shit with them.
Wasn't Forge's superior unit called the "Grizzly" or something?
I can't remeber
oh the anoyance of getting owned by two of them
Something like that
I know that it was badass
so halo exists on PC?
Halo 1/2
1 and 2
Ah
They should put Halo Wars on PC
Funny halo was PC at first then suddenly XBOX
other way round
I actually got the 2nd one on PC
....
Jean Luck Ponicard
klrpwny wat.
FOr the longest time, I referred to Halo as "The Traitor"
how was halo PC first
.-.
November 15, 2001 as a launch title for the Xbox gaming system
and infernap, no, Halo was ORIGINALLY supposed to be a PC game\
Wiki it
oh...my god. My friend is trying to get all the LPS toys at Mcdonalds....If they were ponies I would be interested.
morning crazy bastards
Oi
wiki says xbox and pc two years later
I'm not a bastard.
>:l
You're a bastard DWR.
SnipsandSnails isn't it the same?
Sup
DashWithRainbows: what do you want to be then?
Then when X-box was announced, they switched it to X-Box
Don't say bad things about yourself, Joomay
it isn't nice
SnipsandSnails, he's getting updated with the time, better you should join
All english are bastards, because it sounds so damn awesome in their accent
DashWithRainbows: how about insane guy # 12334213e543
Hai Bronysith
Ahahahahahah
whatever
hi everyone :)
Vivix: What do you think about this character?
DashWithRainbows: crazy bastard it is
...
Gilda?
If I see the first episode. And it's good. Then I'll probably get one.
She's mean, frustrated, probably insecure- attractive but--veryyyy abbrasive and angry
good morning everyone^_^
Vivix: From what little we saw of her =3
But yeah, Halo is a traitor to Master PC Gaming Race, but we forgive it, because it got a PC release EVENTUALLY
Frustratred?
How so?
She seems to be-
Gilda should be in S3
She clings to RD- and she's kind of- not interested in knowing anyone else
nice gilda
or being friendly to anyone else
Aha
Don't want to break routine.
I can see that
to me it sounded like she was frustrated with whatever is going on in her life, and running away to see old friends
what if suddenly nice gilda
i think she died
Speaking about RAINBOW DASH
Ew
Vivix: I got to watch closer, I missed that.
Non-Luna/Celestia alicorn
Oh god
Ewwwww
Go away
It might be my imagination
And she apologizes to :'( and :D and :O
Oh wait, forgot Cadence.
She cool
but- I also think Rarity is insecure
:>
yeah
You wish you were cool ashie-poo
Vivix: Well she's a career woman. :P
I am cool
Nahp
I sleep in a freezer
I'm so cool
Pfft
In sweet and elite she denies herself, and despite knowing the WINNER of the best young flier, she doesn't see that as something impressive coming from her and lies
DashWithRainbows: cold even?
Vivix I think the 2nd option cause it's a childrens cartoon i doubt they put that much thought into it
Fun thing. Griffins are thrown from their nest to teach them how to fly. Until she learned to fly, she wouldn't be able to go home. ANother fun fact, Griffins that smell of another species are shunned.
that's a lazy response killerpony7733
Well, I have been known to be cold towards children...
So yeah
I'm cold.
No, you're heartless.
DashWithRainbows: like that one guy from Dusks Dawn
Vivix: One of the reason I don't like Rarity :P
I love her- I think she's great
Speaking about PONIES...well duh
YAY!
One of the main reasons you have no friends.
:>
Why can't I have a heart made of ice, Joomay?
Heart of ice DashWithRainbows?
Vivix Still why would they add such adult emotions and all to a childrens cartoon?
So much cooler.
but I think she doesn't believe her own achievements or relations are good enough
cuz
DashWithRainbows: you interested in playing Phantasy star online?
u suk
killerpony7733, because it's written by adults?
Nope
U blow, Joomay
WHy would they put alchohol in a cartoon, Killer?
not anymore
DashWithRainbows: prepare for assimilation
we put feeling into whatever we do, because otherwise we get bored
dabi n me r ova
remba
Oh yeah
people who think it don't matter because childrens target demographic, are the people who write shitty fanfics and try to get away with it
u ran to Ponies47 and Ninjazz
Pinkie can be annoying sometimes, Rarity is full of herself, and Rainbow Dash is even more full of herself.
Oh
Vivix Completely missing the point it's mean't to be a childrens cartoon yes hints of these emotions are there but it's usually at such a level it's nothing mostly
And Panda
:>
DashWithRainbows:
?
What about Pondoo?
they suk
No, it's probably there, whether or not intentionally doesn't matter
just like you
meh
You still stink.
we're discussing a perceival, so that basically bypasses intention, doesn't it?
No matter what,.
Meh
You would make a great Dyson
DashWithRainbows: You no like me :<
Nope
Lawl
I hate everything.
He doesn't like anyone.
Foooool.
Even myself.
DashWithRainbows: you're not meanwhile
Meanwhile loves us, he's just too bitter to show it
http://youtu.be/AQRIRj5-19M WELP
hes a hedgehog Vivix
I know, Meanwhile shares his honest opinion though
Hehe
but yeah I think Rarity can be very insecure, in certain aspects of her life, and that makes her interesting
People actually ship Applejack and Applebloom O_O and Rarity and Sweetie Belle
So much effort into what other thinks of her, that it is more important than what she thinks herself
Pfft
Please
ofcourse SnipsandSnails
my friend tells me applejack is one dimensional, not her fault the writers give her no episodes for development
Well
She is a background pony
doesn't matter what people tell you, what you see is what matters
DashWithRainbows: true
Rarity is best pony
Nah
I adore Rarity-
Tom is.
Vivix:
VIVIV
VIVIX!*
WAHUH?
DashWithRainbows, but Tom is with Rarity
and heck Rarity named Tom
Hehehe
Tom is a giant diamond, he will last for centuries.
Rarity won't.
:>
Did you listen to their conversation?
It was strange
Something about--hooficure "But all my friends are getting iit!"
I'm watching Gravity Falls.
Good boy.
Vivix: XD I know where that convo is goin
Hehe
I like listenign to the bg ponies
Ooooh
YAY
I also LOVE Cheerilee's expression when Sweetie Bell asks her how she can be single
A Crossover(Or not)
what games, shows, comics, that have pretty good content, but the fans of said games, comics, anime, are all terriblle
Many
Cheerilles like "oh my fckin god..."
"not this again"
Bronysith too many to count
http://youtu.be/tWBA2LCjnlM
It implies so much about Cheerilee
in my headcanon she's gayer than gay, but--heeey bias, how you doin'
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351951102446.jpg
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dexbSkE5dwQ&feature=g-u-u it has been done
Dat Bronysith:S

well it's just a week, and ello there socksthe

Vivix: and then puke out of sheer disapointment
Kandarihu: Seems Sumi must have overslept or his alarm failed again
...wat

Hiya

Vivix, you won't be watching it.
Oh no, I won't be disappointed

*sumica
inb4 nothing but disappointment
...wait a sec

You can't be disappointed when your only expectation is "Anything"
You're gonna be forced to live in a cave without anything Vivix.

Littlepip touched the what now?

Applejack says in A Dog and Pony Show, "Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off, but Rarity won't even touch mud unless it's imported."

CrimsonPhoenix: Yep c:
Invi well, there are already the VGA (Video Game Awards) but thats something else altogether xD
OH AND ONE MORE THING
...it's a lost cause, isn't it? We've missed too much of the Aquabats to follow what's left.
ima sowwy fluffeh ;_;
/me huggles AttackWithHugs
Lil_B, don't EVER talk about that joke again
What ever your drawing Looks adorable O3O
WATCH MY VIDEO GRAPIST
VGA is the most pretentious, horrible, hypocrite show I've ever seen in my life
wrek is drawin again? Awesome!
build a some...build a some...deep wide bell, wounde-er...deep wide bell, wounde-er
Rex_Mundi, Domo is
08,01Rex_Mundi: domo is
I dont think its Wrek
08,01wrek is banned from streaming for a month
IF YOU DODN'T
O_O
what for?
Rex_Mundi, it's Domo. Wrek is banned
Wrek!
No!
streaming explicit content
Wrek got banned?!
D:
08,01the Penn and Teller Porn episode
Wait why?
it looks DW'AAAAHH-able
I WILL GRAPE YOU!!!!!!!!
:'(
Well, this is supposed to be a 14+ chatroom. XD
But Wrek is coming back Nov 18th~
Um...What?
Wrek shoed porn here?
Never liked Penn and Teller anyways
but I like Wrek... :(
I Dun Wanna Be Graped 3':
6_9?
BYE :)
bye gr... okay
Dafuq is this about pen and teller porn?
Why would Wrek do that? :'(
CrimsonPhoenix which joke?
because Wrek iz r epuhk
You guys arnt mad at Wrek are you?
So who here has SuperBrony's twitter feed open in another tab and keeping track of him at EQLA?
08,01Rex_Mundi: i have my... own opinions, but i shan't share them in here
HoodyNinja Actually people said yes to it but since it pokes the rules hard theres a reason why he has gotten stream ban
They showed the Episode of Penn and Teller about Pornogrophy
^
/me pokes AttackWithHugs "We can rebuild it :3"
Lil_B, VGA
gtg, going to see Wreck-It Ralph
What was it about? I dont realy know the show. Did it SHOW porn, the making of porn, what? O.o
FlutterMEDIC: TAKE ME WITH U
Penn and Teller did an episode of Bull**** defending porn from the concerns that they could dispute. It included actual clips of porn.
Oh
Yeah but however whilst everyone was okay with it it's again a bit of a big rule breaker
Well damn
Oh.
Oh dear anthro
y u no say goodbye!?
When was he banned?
RaveBrony, oct 18th
Noted!
Sumica: I just hope you guys dont have negative feelings with each other.
killerpony7733, I wan't okay with it, and I think there were some complaints from people brave enough to actually complain
So... is this Sweetie Belle?
CrimsonPhoenix I don>'t recalkl a joke about hthem, (other than they usually aren't taken seriously by true gamers)
My little Schoogirl
Scootaloo?
/me hands Jmo a pillow
btw, methinks its Fluttershy
Apple Bloom?
This might not be a pony...
That's ze spirit fluffy :3
You drawing Domo?
i dunno who it is, but it looks adorable :3
I think it is Flutters too
Lil_B, the VGA is horrible and the whole concept is shamefull to the average gamer
Please be filly Twilight
like G4tv
I was going to say: Wasn't the reason Wrek banned himself precisely *because* there were some people who complained?
Or not
xP
GilDash: He banned himself????
Wait, Wrek is the one that banned Wrek?
GilDash: Like quit?
BANCEPTION
Kandarihu Why in the heck would anyone not say anything about it? wrek wouldn't do anything fi they didn't say yes. But point is the vote was show it but again rule breaker so understandable
Rex_Mundi: He basically imposed the ban on himself from what I understand.
your talkign to phase?
Mega_Milk Not permanently just for a month
ask him why he left without saying goodbye
November 18th
wait why did wrek ban himself?
Scootaloo.
killerpony7733: Ah ok thats more acceptable.
Mega_Milk: For one month. 18th October until 18th November.
Nope. Twilight?
Ohey, a pony
08,01i'm not sure if anyone complained or not, actually
that's better!
08,01but it was decided by the admins that he was streaming inappropriate content
I missed the whole thing either way, just caught what was said last night.
08,01so he was banned from streaming for a month
Doll?
So Wrek is banned till the 18th?
08,01DerpyMuffins: from streaming, yes
08,01he can still come in the caht
08,01*chat
Just streaming?
Well this was hardly the only thing Wrek showed that I had a problem with. I'm VERY uncomfortable with Eddie Izzard being shown on here, but the general rule is that I'm not supposed to complain about the stream at all, because I'm not paying in to it, and I should just pause or mute the stream if I'm personally offended by it's contents.
Is this Pound Cake or Carrot Cake?
Yep this is filly Twi
08,01Kandarihu: what's wrong with Eddie Izzard?
Who is it Domo?
Looks like I've picked a good time to avoid the following conversations...
Kandarihu the rules is don't whine about stream if the stream isn't breaking rules
whining is disrespectful to the streamer, and we don't do it
08,01Kandarihu: well, it's hardly against the rules to stream transvestite comedy
^^
is this song from megaman x 7/8
Nice piano version of Smile Smile Smile going on on EQLA stream
Brb everypony, gotta reset my router
Bye DerpyMuffins
Okay, i gotta clean my snakes cage, bbl
Good afternoon everypony, how we doing today? :)
But it was so cute... Even if I had no clue what it was
Good afternoon BladedWings|HW :)
Watching someone draw. Afternoon BladedWings
Ironically, covering up the stream and muting it IS what I personally did over the porn episode. But this does run against the streaming rules.
latas
hello BladedWings|HW
That's not ironic though
when we see something we don't like in stream, we don't watch it
08,01Kandarihu: how's that ironic?
be right back everypony, gone to shopping
Bye Dark92Enigma :)
when something that isn't supposed to be streamed, it is breaching the. Doesn't matter if we complain or not
/me hugs Colt_Brovakiin Friendchips and Ragnano ^_^
bye Dark92
/me huggles BladedWings|HW back :3
bye everypony. Gonna look for mulia Mild fanart
Either Blueblood or Fancy Pants...
bye Chips
Bye Fri-
gone
anyone know when mlp fighting is magic is coming out
i need to another monitor just for bronystate
buy
oh
There are things that go on, even in that very show, that I need to respond to... come to think of it, I think I had the stream unmuted and was responding to the ideas there as well.
wow
08,01i need 9 monitors for bronystate
who is drawing?
08,011 for mane chat, 6 for siderooms, 1 for #bronystateregulars, 1 for stream
mkay
xD
Blueblood or Fancypants? I can't tell. :s
I just need another monitor. Currently, I can play in one screen and do everything else in another, but that's not enough.
08,01Vivix: that is pretty much my life
oh its Domo ^_^ yay
You're never forced to respond to anything Kandarihu, sometimes sitting down and going "none of my business" is best solution
bronystateregulars? whats that for
08,01p4ngya: bronystate regulars.
p4ngya: Exactly what it says on the tin.
my computer can only handle 4 monitors at anyone time though
INB4 joins.
cause they already did the tournament and other than fluttershys character and music it seemed good enough for a multiplayer release which they said they would release even if the story mode isnt done yet
BladedWings|Hw: >w< -hug-
p4ngya, IT'S NOTHING
NOTHING AT ALL
but...why are bronystateregulars in bronystate D:
/me hugs Domo back ^_^
I want two monitors when I build my computer
*aren't
I'd help 'monitor' but I'm going to be busy... with writing... possibly all day. -_-
Called it.
08,01AttackWithHugs: get 3
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU
Vivix, you've never been forced to defend values that you care about when they were under attack, were you?
But I need some space for that, which I don't have at the moment
08,01also, my god, i *love* mushrooms
Kandarihu I have, but why should i defend my points when they don't need it?
Now all the new guys will try to get in!
I can't live without two monitors :<
I want 3 monitors when I get my new PC. Finally getting the space for them as well. >: )
And we won't be able to do squat about it!
It's not a secret club.
some graphics cards only support 2 though! be careful
all this talk about monitors
08,01AttackWithHugs: at least your room is clean
huh
Because it's smaller than the one when I first moved with my sister
i only have one
:(
Alright back
I only have 1 monitor, im looking to get another :)
Coolu: same here
I only have one monitor too- but I only need one! Honest!
Yup. People joining. Then leaving.
Coolu: its ok i have only one as well *hug*
But we go here to get away from the idiots on movie nights. They'll come in here for it and screw it up!
OH wait
welcome back DerpyMuffins
Most of them aren
I don't even go here anymore
wb DerpyMuffins
its a guy taking a shit!
Hi DerpyMuffins
Welcome back DerpyMuffins :)
08,01i moved back in with my parents because i couldn't afford accommodation while at uni, and while i was living else where, they converted my bedroom into a storeroom
seriously guys, dual displays is a must these days
Most people aren't on this time of day IIRC.
It's YOUR problem :)
08,01they never converted it back once i moved back in
!
Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.
08,01and, of course, *i* can't move anythign, because it's all their stuff
Back Sorry About That xP
I could use a few more monitors. One for IRC, one for web browsing, one for the obligatory video streams, one for Bronystate stream, and one for gaming.
I could use two, one for DAW one for note's and mixer
My biggest problem is room. I don't have enough space on my wall for monitors.
but I don't need two
I could use 3 but 2 would be enough for me at the moment
lololol
Most of my wall is covered by shelves.
One for IRC, another for stream/other things
people and using walls
I don't have monitors on my waaall oh god no
i dont have the money for a third
08,01honestly, i've been using just 1 monitor for years now
Jmo: If you saw my desk, you'd understand
08,01i used to have 3 monitors
Linux window switch?
once i have the cables i will set up my second monitor :)
08,01but i've been using a laptop as my main computer for a while
eww
laptop
how do you game?
08,01if i had a desk, i'd set up a second monitor
08,01infernap12: i don't
08,01even though it's a gaming laptop
Yeah, I've been useing my laptop for about 3 years now. I don't even have a mouse.
gasp
08,01i don't like computer games
Hehe
Man this guy playing pony music on piano at EQLA is awesome
I game, but not nearly as much as anyone else in ehre it seems
Computer games are for people with spare time.
08,01i bought a gaming laptop so that i could do GPGPU CUDA and OpenCL programing on it
08,01actually, there are a few games i've enjoyed recently
08,01the portal series, and WoW
for 2d graphics--where the hell do you start? Direct2D?--OpenGL didn't seem to natively support it-?
And SuperBrony makes his first EQLA purchase: https://twitter.com/ConCrusaders/status/264766231469518848/photo/1/large
08,01both of which my laptop runs quite happily
i don't play WoW anymore
Portal is a fun series.
but portal is fun
Especially the second Portal game,.
I cried.
08,01Vivix: openGL has 2D stuff; but if you want to start really simple, try PyGame
Python? I've tried that a very long time ago- before properly learning-
08,01it's a library for Python, and it's the only graphics library i've ever used that's actually *fun* to program in
I kinda want to try a C or C++ library-
ooh
I hear Python is fairly fun.
I've heard good things about Python, and common lisp
Been meaning to start learning it, but goddamn school.
this music
....where is it from?
CrimsonPhoenix: i second this inquiry
;o; Sumica I got kicked from the RD channel?
SONIC RUSH
08,01Vivix: use opengl rather than directx
is it?
08,01Vivix: it's mre portable
i thought this was from the rythom heaven gams
okay- I'll try to get the SDK and such- was kinda hard to navigate
08,01Vivix: http://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=2D_using_OpenGL
DirectX api was so full of Windows 8 and appstore that it was more confusing than helpful at first
Oh, thank you!
I can't wait to not use Windows 8 ever.
Don't start with W8 hate.
Ahh
08,01i feel more people will be switching over to Linux
08,01try out Ubuntu; it's really nice
W8 sucks
Steam is going linux now
Jmo: Hey, not saying it's all bad.
good thing I just recently upgraded to 7
I'm just saying.
I kinda hope W8 is just a sidestep for touch-stuff
So many people hate on it, it's hilarious.
08,01if you dont like the new Ubuntu Unity interface, try Xubuntu, which uses the Xfce desktop environment
but W7 - I love it
Vivix: i hope so
08,01or Linux Mint with either Cinnamon or Mate
Linux will be taking over in a few decades
that's because w8's ui is crap
What about Kubuntu?
lol^
08,01DerpyMuffins: not even in a few decades
if I wanted a toy I'd have bought a mac
i actually considered trying ubuntu
08,01DerpyMuffins: i reckon that linux will be much much bigger on the desktop in the next 5 years
but what else can you expect from wannabe jobs balmerware
08,01infernap12: i don't know; i've never done it before
08,01look for an opengl sdk
SONIC RUSH MUSIC FTW
like whats your career/ career pathway?
08,01DerpyMuffins: i do; it's not without its faults, though
The only problem I have with Linux, being a gamer through and through, is the vast amount of distros.
One of the Princesses then, considering the scepter.
Man wish I could have done EQLA. Disneyland across the street, the documentary premiere, SB being there. Just wish I had the cash for all that
OMG WHY DO I KEEP GETTING THAT RUSSIAN JUSTIN BIEBER AD
08,01Kammerjunk: oh, that's easy; just use ubuntu :P
Distros can be confusing
I only remember the old ones-
but Ubuntu is said to be very simple for linux-noobs
Last time we tried linux we tried Debian desktop I think- and we weren't able to access root or su
08,01Kammerjunk: perosnally, i really dislike the Unity interface
oh crap I forgot I was still on here
08,01so i've been using Xubuntu for ages
I tried Linux, but it got too confusing
I've generally preferred Kubuntu, to be honest. But my install on my old computer died a long time ago and I never felt like fixing it.
08,01linux is just as simple to use as Windows nowadays
this accordeon makes me want to play Layton
If Steam really goes ahead and makes a client for linux and gets most of my old games running there, I might as well switch, too.
I was a KDE fan back in linux days, so Kubuntu speaks to me
08,01RainbowAsh: it's not a matter of if; they're releasing the beta later this month
but people told me not to get it because of Ram hog-
GOOGLE: helps fix the worst time of hair issue ;)
Ubuntu was the first distro I was introduced to (at work) so I'm sticking with it for now
Yeah, Steam is releasing a client and L4D2 for Linux
08,01Kammerjunk: aye; they've ported all their Source games, and a *lot* of developers are porting their games too
Trying new things Domo?
I am excite.
yay, i might as well switch to linux :P
08,01in fact, they're finding they get better performance in Linux than Windows
No surprises there.
08,01Vivix: i think that was just for a dedicated server
I am too used to Windows to switch to linux
08,01DerpyMuffins: no you're not
Really? I thought it was the game as well-
EILEMONTY DID A COVER OF THE MOON RISES
OADGFNJVODWSNFWVIWSANGFDVKIRDSFN B
08,01ekips: not... really
CrimsonPhoenix: Wait, she did?
I think Linux is going to grow, but it'll probably be a bit of a nerd thing for quite a while
<_<
08,01honestly, there's no real difference between distros
http://i.imgur.com/LchdK.jpg mY desktop on Ubuntu
[Alpha]: I approve this wallpaper.
08,01imma move onto my laptop and show you my desktop
I MISS LINUX
But I have no spare computers!
inb4 flood of desktop screenshots
i dunno which ubuntu version i should use if i switch to linux
Kammerjunk: Thank you :P
[Alpha]: Very nice choice of background there :3
:P

Gah, I need more sockets with grounding in my room.
Mine is Rarity and a Dragon
i need THAT SMITH
J_E_Smith71 I need one, now! >.>
I have more but I prefer Ocavia at the moment. It makes me so Happy when I load up my computer
J_E_Smith71 i want! i want! I WANT!!!
Hello everypony.
hi VenHur
Hai
Hai VenHur
hello VenHur
ekips: SuperBrony already picked up one custom OC one: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A6yjfBfCcAABpXk.jpg:large
ohai VenHur
ok I am back... whats the stream?
Anyone know an easy version of Linux for a beginner?
Ubuntu
Ubuntu indeed
thanks BladedWings|HW
J_E_Smith71 I'd be glad if I could get a Vinyl Scratch ^^
Ah the piano guy at EQLA's doing Smile Smile Smile again
Mornin guys, who be streamin?
ekips: i would rather pick a octavia one
I kinda want..Mandrake but--Ubuntu seems to be a standard for users- almost- so--fuk
I gotta say, EileMonty really love to customize her covers
Nice music, here
Hai DoctoDoctorWho :)
Ayejay ayejay ayejay
I'm off until the Euro Movie Night. Cu all l8r
Hi, Jmo! :)
Good afternoon AJIsAwesome :)
whats superbronys twitter acc called?
morning DoctoDoctorWho
And good afternoon, everyone! :)
Remember guys, follow SuperBrony's live EQLA coverage hereL https://twitter.com/ConCrusaders
RainbowAsh: bai
Is the default Firefox for ubantu?
isn't it Con
nevermind
AJ! *huggles AJIsAwesome *
ohai AJIsAwesome
hi AJIsAwesome :)
J_E_Smith71 trying but cant connect to their chat as well for some reason :(
DerpyMuffins: i think so
So It's Luna. It's always Woon.
/me hugs Jmo Colt_Brovakiin BladedWings|HW ekips and DoctoDoctorWho :)
hi AJIsAwesome
/me hugs AJIsAwesome back :)
I might switch to Linux if I can keep using my favorite browser
DerpyMuffins what is your favourite browser?
DerpyMuffins: Probably can. What is it?
Ffirefox or chrome?
Maxthon3
And of course Everfree has their video stream (Listen to a MLP piano medley): http://www.everfree.net/eqla/
Firefox
thanks Colt_Brovakiin sorry I couldent find your comment :P
it's built into ubuntu
DerpyMuffins: Firefox is imo the best browser
its ok :P
DerpyMuffins, Firefox is available for Ubuntu. Not sure if it's default for it though.
Yes it's default
Firefox is the default browser for Ubuntu
/me hugs Ragnano :)
Sorry I just prefer Maxthon as my browser
/me is listening to ACDC "Back In Black" currently
Don't know what's up with their chat box, but I'm paying attention to this one anyways
I used Kubuntu, and the default browser is Konqueror, which is stil nicer than IE.
I have both chrome and firefox just in case though
/me hugs AJIsAwesome back
Words are incapable of describing the awesome:)
[Alpha]: same here
DerpyMuffins: There isn't a Maxthon 3 version for Ubuntu AFAIK. Don't think Maxthon 3 works very well with Wine, either.
Can I even swtich browsers with ubantu? If I can then I will switch
Kammerjunk: i don't like maxthon 3
I have Firefox and Firefox Portable on an USB stick, just in case :3
Ragnano: No, but DerpyMuffins does.
I also have both windows and lunix on my computer. when it loads up it gives me a choice of which one I want to use.
Of course you can switch browser on Ubuntu
Vivix I will eat your computer.
I DARE YOU
OH IT'S ON.
IT'S SO FULL OF CATPISS YOU'LL DIE
wat
???
.....wat
Ubantu is faster right?
In performence
Pinkie Pie O.o
what..just happened?
This is an interesting conversation to walk back into.
All u's darling
Ubuntu
I think it's a little bit faster
LOLOL
Agreed, GilDash. :D
Vivix just trails off like it never happened.
WELL
It was just a catpee joke ;__;
Vivix: El shitbox?
Which is faster?
I have luna as my theme on chrome and Octavia as my theme on firefoc
Oh noo, it is a crazy computer
firefox
Which if faster between what?
OS
let me test
[Alpha]: luna is best princess :P
Well Linux is usually faster than windows
but neither is slow
I don't think this laptop likes working much anymore... it keeps acting like its crashed once on desktop, but is just loading without response. -_-
Time to start transfering files
Vivix: not if you don't have aslow pc
Im using an 11 year old dell laptop right now, why me:'(
Well, I'm planning on doing a complete wipe of my system soon, so I might as well install Ubuntu as a partition.
Maybe not, I dunno
I want linux again too, I dunno I just miss it- and now that I dabble in programming, it would be fun to customize it like hell
Well, if it's a call of whether to update to Windows 8 or go to Linux, I'll be heading the Linux way.
Is this Celestia or Luna? She's got the Black motif of Luna but the Flames of Celestia
but- none of my music or animation software work in Linux
They do a fusion dance or something while I wasn't looking?
GilDash: Hah, no. Windows 7 will probably become the new Windows XP.
Probably indeed
Just have them both like I do
Kammerjunk: Running Win7 now. Won't be leaving it for 8.
StinkomanFan: i think it is neither
Guess Im switching to linux
GilDash: Same here
Any advice for first time users?
I might create a partition or buy a hdd for linux and do a double start-
who is he drawing
DerpyMuffins: You'll probably want to start with Ubuntu.
I'm on Windows 8 right now to test it for a month. Will probably switch back to 7 though >.>
no idea
StinkomanFan: Celunstia? The Super stallion of legend?
why ekips?
the only reason id switch to 8 would be for the gigantic performance increases
DoctoDoctorWho: lol
DoctoDoctorWho: Sumerpan?
CELUNSTIA, GODDESS OF ALL
I think of it like this: Win7 = XP. Win8 = Vista.
Stallion? Godess? make up your minds
GilDash: That sounds accurate.
GilDash: every 2nd windows is a fail :P
Jmo The new things do not appeal to me, like the charm bar
It is a possibility, Im just saiyan.
This laptop used to have Vista on it... *shudder*
Right.
Apperance is everything it seems.
I dunno... 95 > 98 seemed to be okay.
The charm bar is just not handy enough
ooh software upgradde
GilDash: i don't mean the old ones
my meal is ready, seeya for Euro Night!
yeah google chrom is faster on ubuntu
ekips: bai
Ragnano: Where do you draw the line though? It's only just begun trending with Vista...
brb, helping my brother
Possibly Win2000.
this song is win
Chrome was slower on all canvas related things to me
Can you even download Maxthon on ubuntu?
even Ie9 was faster-
Roseluck`: what is it?
isnt this in madoka magica?
Well the piano medley is over. EQLA's opening ceremony is coming up
Wow. IE9 faster then Chrome. O_o
Roseluck`, yes. It's the ED theme, Magia
IE9?
damn right :D
.-.
Jmo: No, but I am and will always be a gamer through and through. Both Blizzard and VALVe consider Windows 8 an absolute catastrophe (which is why VALVe is bringing Steam to Linux).
back
IE internet explorer
There's plenty who think Win8 is a catastrophe in gaming terms.
IE9 was faster than chrome on Canvas related things
I'm certainly one of them.
So NOW I remember why I found the name Kalafina and their style so familiar!
Roseluck`: stream hates me so I guess Ill just have to be content with listening to ACDC Back in black
lolol
my friend downloaded the windows 8 demp, and he says it runs terrible
Please, tell me what is wrong with W8 in gaming terms.
GilDash: Ditto.
win8 isa terrible desicion
Guuyyysss
Jmo: Closed system.
yup
Celunstia... what happens if she does the fusion dance with ChrystaliCadence
SuperBrony runs into Mr.MOV himself: https://twitter.com/ConCrusaders/status/264772428402655234/photo/1/large
Which is a shame, because I'm soon to become a PC gamer again and Win8 is the first thing that would hit me. -_-
Vivix: yeeeeeesss?
So that's the only reason you're gonna lay on me?
Pffft
Kammerjunk: that's why i don't like apple
Staaap iiit
I HATE the closed system design
I don't mind closed systems
it always gets in your way
it --kinda depends
I wonder if all the new prebuilts hitting the market are all going to be running Windows 8
i feel clostrophobic
hey anypony here know e nomine?
Wait... that's not a scepter
and trapped
Jmo: It's why I don't like it. I'm not telling you what to do, I'm saying why I don't feel it's good for a gamer.
Closed system, resource hog, stupid user interface, designed for tablets not PCs, no start menu, Windows store, etc.
IT'S A TORCH :O
'resource hog' false.
It has a start menu though, I think
Omg, downloading ubuntu on my desktop is gonna take forever
'stupid UI' false
I'm back guys! Domo art stream? :O
no start menu, false.
WB!
it's a fire wand, silly
Windows store is optional.
MadSurge: wb, and yes
MadSurge: Welcome back~ and yep :3
there is a start menu, its ust harder to find and works terrible
def no resource hog, lightest, fastest OS yet
StinkomanFan: Chryluntadencia, boo-yah.
lol i see my comments
'Harder to find and works terrible' False.
Depends on your version. It's worse then Win7 for resources used, it's got a stupid UI unless you get the full version, no start menu unless full version, only Windows store unless full version.
true
this charms crap is rediculous
full version is cheap though
lolol
Domo: dat Madoka Magica ending theme <3
Can you change your orb for ununtu?
It's cheap because MS know it's shite.
Newegg is carrying 64 models of Desktop PCs with Windows 8
It's cheap because they want to sell many
Chryluntadencia. Would she still be a princess or a Queen at that point?
MadSurge: Yes <33 Kalafina is awesome
if(windows8_is_good == true) {CW("What?"); }
They're competing with Apple and the smartphone industry. They don't give a crap about the PC marketplace at the moment; it's shrinking anyway.
win8 is especialy terrible if your a user from a previous windows, and youll just get confused
Lol.
Whatever floats your boat.
StinkomanFan: Chryluntadencia, God Empress of the imperium of ponykind
i think for a pc beginner win8 is just fine
Pc market isn't shrinking
Sales are decreasing.
and for someone whose advanced at pc?
for someone whos new, they wont know that everything else is better
HP and plenty of other manufacturers are struggling to sell. Their profits are losses.
but for a previous user, its crap
Hi everybody :)
Chryluntadencia... AKA Fausticorn
Yo GilDash :3
well who the fuck buys prebuilt computers?
hi
A lot of people.
not pc nerds
hey The_Engineer
Small minority.
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
sales are fine, and offices still prefer computers over any other crap
If sales are fine why are losses beign recorded?
i made the computer for my dad, and it works better than pre-builds
How the hell should I know
custom is best
Cause sales aren't fine, obviously.
Hi, The_Engineer and MadSurge. :)
obviously I fucked up
custom is pretty solid
I don't think there's a problem
EQLA's opening ceremony has started. Now it really begins
AJIsAwesome! :$
btw anypony know how to build a Commodore 128?
nope
a what?
Vivix: I'm nitpicking like there's no tomorrow here, but of course they're using computers, silly.
Noone in office environment would prefer to work on a touch-screen, I would rather work on a typewriter
Smartphones are the new PCs. MS know that and are tryign to jump onto the bandwagon. Problem is Win8 is going to suffer as a result of their desire to make it cross-platform.
i cant see whats the link for the livestream
a type of computer
smartphones aren't the new pc's they're the new gadget
Are you serious?
well I finally got the chat to work on that LA convension stream BYE!
they're for social shit and taking pictures
Smartphones are the new PCs?
smartphones will neverbe able to match up to pc's
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128
You're making my brain cells commit suicide GilDash.
meow
I'm talking market, not actual tech.
WHATS THE LINK FOR THE LIVESTREAM
Computers aren't made for gaming and surfing, that's why they're not tailoring to it
because the more they can put into a smart phone, they can fit EVEN MORE into a PC
pony_3699: what the LA thing?
I wanna test the canvas on chrome. P.m a link
Again, market, not tech.
BUT you can even run ubuntu on smartphones, with monitor and everything
Oh yeah I heard about that
Don't have a link to chrome, I did have a link to a line-draw loop though
cpomputers ARE made for surfing and gamin
Financial market. Not technology. Big difference.
not FOR
No I already have chrome
what'ss ubuntu again?
lunix
Bonnie Zacherle > Lauren faust > Chryluntadencia
I mean canvas* not chrome
whaere is the livestream vid???!!!
[Alpha]: lol lunix
They ported ubuntu on the nexus 7 tablet
Who's Bonnie Zacherle? The chick who founded the series I take it?
Euro movie night starts at 1:59 PM? :I
RDLovesPi: Cool story bro
Domo: I'm digging this music
pony_3699: which one the one on the left or the LA convension one? :P
hurrp derp
>w< Glad you like!
dismo, its gunna be 10 59 here
[Alpha]: "Cool story Bro" ....Just...No.
the actual livestream vid i cant see it
Good choice of music Domo
StinkomanFan: Bonnie Zacherle, Rockin the world with ponies since 1983
http://jsperf.com/fillorpath here's a canvas speed test

pony_3699: YOu probably need to update your flash player.
*You
pony_2608: Spike has no vid
how?
chat goes crazy bananas when there's a lot of people
^ :D
infernap12 because we can't hold all these guys in one big room
infernap12: when chat starts overflowing
Kelpow: Thank you :)
Vivix: You mean like it will on Nov 10th? XD
oh hay yeah
pony_3699: Do you have Adobe FLash Player?
noproblem
LOL so anyways bye :P
infernap12: Mainly for new episodes. Next week its going to be chaos with over thousands of people. So the side rooms are there for handling giant crowds
I won't be on chat then, but it will be crazy
The mods will only open side chat rooms on the 10th
The main will be closed most likely
i should have it
J_E_Smith71: Will the chat reactions be recorded? :)
We will have all 6 PACKED on the 10th
but my youtube isnt working eaither
I won't be on on 10th. I'm away, so I might miss the 1st S3 episode. :(
DoctoDoctorWho: Everyone will go to all the chats except AJ's. :D
AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/39fad0d97e68105c1dc83ebc11780686.png :3
Im going out with my GF on the 10th
DoctoDoctorWho: of course they will
I'm going on Aj.
So I wont be here either
Because of that
AJIsAwesome: Sure, TroIIestia and swainize should be back to do that
yay higurashi!
J_E_Smith71: Okay. Thanks! :)
derpy, tell her ponys are more important
I should have played this song on Halloween >w>;

It'll be like, the super bowl, world cup, major leage, the olympics, and every other major sports event in history, COMBINED.
i can't see anything
I'd like to keep my GF Kelpow
DoctoDoctorWho: rrright!

The stream makes me wish I can draw :/
Super's singing along with Smile Smile Smile right now
DoctoDoctorWho: biggest Event in all of time and space ^^
pony_3261: i think you should update your flash player
Blowing off a date to watch ponies isnt the gentlemans way
GilDash: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/d49b9eeb4ca1c526c5b1afd59997a447.png here's an RD for you, so you won't feel alone next saturday :)
urgh......
there it goes
DerpyMuffins: better idea, watch ponies WITH your date
DerpyMuffins: then bring her with you! ponys are calling you!
exactly
MadSurge, who's the artist?
MadSurge: I shall print her out and take her with me. XD
I would blow off a date for ponies- jeez what is wrong with me
My GF doesnt exactly like ponies
Vivix: nothing
is strream broken?
She doesnt hate it, just not intrested
J_E_Smith71: So he's on the stage?
Kelpow: it seems so
/me is totally fine
CrimsonPhoenix: it's right there next to RD's hoof, Sauriv
WHAT? SHES NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU
I am doomed to live without romance in my life...
AJIsAwesome: No but in the crowd of course
.
*Oh
in any case that's a very nice style
I cant exactly ask my GF to change for my sake
Im already engaged to my work
Oh wait that's Rina-Chan dressed as Luna there
maybe the pose could use a little work
who here hasnt seen the bornys react to: teens react to: my litle pony?
J_E_Smith71, of course it is she's the head of EQLA
she is**
J_E_Smith71: Well, I DID NOT see that coming.
I'm going to watch that now
Kelpow: bro, HOOF!!
my stream keeps dying :(
dem buffers :\
CrimsonPhoenix: Didn't know that was her till they called her by name
You guys didn't know Rina-Chan planned EQLA?
otakon: same here :/
Invisible buffer circle!
I knew it from the start
I knew CrimsonPhoenix
her voice doesn't change
DAMN YOU BUFFER CIRCLE!
DAMN YOU!
post links while buffer? :P
and she did a horrible impersonation of Luna
I can't even see the Buffer Circle. It's transparent-white on white.
DctoDoctorWho (\ brohof!

love the nazi joke
SpeccyRush: oh XD just needed a refresh XD
as long as you dont make the jews and pizzas joke :P
YO STREAM IS STILL ON NO VID LINKS
pizza?
Dken2021: You can usually find HD uploads on youtubes within a day anyhow. But being there is preferable I suppose
Fl00t4sh41 yea, there's always that, but I like watching it with you guys
wait....the voice and writers have two panels?
EQLA is so small....
dDken2021 you sure you wanna hear it?
hear what?
the joke
So... why does she have a Coca Cola dress on?
Dken2021: The only episode I've seen live is the season 2 finale. The rest where before I came here
Why doesn't she? :3
this stream is so broken
Kelpow sure I guess
i wish i could go to ANY brony conventions, but 14 years old + living in germany = no suck thing
*such
Dken2021 whats the difrence between a jew and a pizza?
i warned you -.-
pizza comes out?
a pizza does not own a lexuas?
There is a bronycon in the UK
Pizza's don't talk?
Pizzas dont scream when you put them in the oven
*Pizzas
ouch
i dont get it, Kelpow
08,01Kelpow: you're obviously eating the wrong pizzas
DerpyMuffins: but my parents don't allow it...
That is just mean
roseluck' thats a good thing
actually typically they were dead before burning
cheese pizza :)
thats uh.. not normal
Yes it is
screaming pizzas?
normal?
yes
perfectly normal
My pizza scream flavor when I eat it
Pretty sure it is.
dang, i must need better pizzas
all that talk about pizzas reminds me of that one youtube vid, lemme see if i can find it
just a question anyone here play mc?

That was cute, the opening ceremony ending with that marriage proposal
I would if I got a way to cool my laptop with

:O
i wanna plushie
08,01one thing we used to do in Physics to mess with people's heads, was to find the car of a professor or student that was parked on a driveway (without any other cars beside it), and push down and pull up on the back, in time with the oscillating frequency of the suspension
which would do what?
08,01this would set up an active damped SHM system, and eventually the car's back wheels would lift off the road
08,01on the apex of this lift, we'd turn the car slightly
08,01we'd keep doing this until the car was 90 degrees to its original posisiton
:D
:Dkeep going
its alot simpler in practice

Hai Eli

Nittany_Discord: Bonnie Zacherle, creator of the My Little Pony franchise :$
11,01Shizuka: Blown indeed.
well she is Bonnie Zacherle, creator of my pretty pony
11,01Oh. She created G1.
and looks like I was ninja'd on that
who ever created G3.......must be burning in hell

Who ever invented newborn cuties must have been a Satan worshiper...
Nittany_Discord: infact, she actually made the stuff b4 g1
Buytoast: wut?
Shizuka ah, but can we see why kids love the satisfying taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
:P
13because it's satisfying?
No because they taste like awesome
It's because that goddamn baker guy on the front of the box puts LSD or something into the stuff.
11,01No. It's because of the cinnamon and sugar poured into every bite.
SnipsandSnails: wrong, even satan frowns upon their disreputable actions
You can see it in his smug little face.
If you pour milk, cinnamon and sugar into a bolw and shake it, WHAT DO YOU GET?
DELISHUSNESS!
It sucks for people who are allergic to cinnamon
hey guys who's watching the LA thing?

/me blocks soulero's knife and guards his kidney
liver
Dat Cough
Woah

soulero: Would you like a bit off Chianti with this?
d3rb: yet...
dangnamit false alarm sorry I'm back XD

it might catch on though if we keep it up
bad manners
:D
/me stabs Socks
Now you're getting it!
/me bleeds and collapses
DaringDerpy: Yeah, we sell them on black market instead
Thats partly true
its more personal than a handshake,less invasive than a hug
DaringDerpy, well I've been around for about half a year, and I don't recognize soulero.
/me screams ANYTHING FROM THE PONY?! ANYYTHING FROM THE PONY?
???
what from me?
/me stabs Allie to shut her up :P

This is an interesting piece of cinema, but you have to pay attention to the dialogue. They talk a lot but every word is of relevance to the plot
Every movie in black and white is a damn classic,no denying there
Oohhhh... I've head of this movie.
Well if this is not going to be shown from the beginning I'm off to watch this on my own..see you

Ladders!
/me writes in Jmo
why Allie :<
/me 11,01cleans BroHoof
doesn't jury consists of random citizens?
NOOO
Deacon that's a Stepledder...
Yeah, these are random people debating.
Maybe they are random citizens.
k
They're complete strangers.
MA Larson's fav pony to write for is Rarity
his lawyer didn't think he stood a chance? who gave up essentially? Why wasn't he switched out?
Allie: You will never kill me!!!!! hahahahaha
Over analyzing <3
/me glomps Nittany_Discord
All the ponies is best ponies.
:O
^
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Lil_B!
/me writes in thelonepony
/me 11,01hugs BroHoof
Man this court is all kinds of messed up
/me watches thelonepony die
thats not my really name Kira :D
Amy's favorite pony is Pinkie (Considering she gave her so many good moments it shows)
thelonelypony comes back as a zombie
pff.
we need to go deeper
We have to go DEEPER
We have to go even Deeper.
I wonder what is the best programming language to start with. C is pretty simple and straightforward, but Java has easier memory management and more pre-made stuff.
im speaking about the lonely pony OUTSIDE
Ooh, this guy is a foreigner
Deacon I just judged it by the fact that it has Steps... normal ladders only have ledds and these ladfders have some serious step in there ladders
Vash: whose is this thelonelypony you speak of :P
I believe this man is from Czechoslovakia.
BroHoof is your name ♬ Ⅴḯηƴł ϟ¢ґ@⊥¢H ♬ in steam?

TKist oh my, what a username
TKist, yea
SpeccyRush: :D
/me is deppered :3
SpeccyRush: :D
Deacon, i'm crazy xP
So the midway is C++, because you can start here with procedural programming and then jump into oop
so many explosions out side :c
Deacon thats not mine :3
wut.
still, what a username
play hide and seek with the explosins MLP_Brovakiin :3
ikr i don't believe that guy such a weird username
explosions*
all this theories hurt my head >w<
I like how the cast is pretty diverse, and you're getting a good sense of each one's character just based on what they say.
But names are supposed to be odd.
/me gives cachi01 some pillz
PEELZ
Agreed, CriticKitten.
but still I'm not sure what should I recommend to somebody new to programming
Ah, now I get the movie :|
oh no, he's getting angry
ohai AJIsAwesome :3
Larson's now explaining Luna Eclipsed
PEELZ HIER
thelonepony cool guys don't look at explosions
angry man count: 1
The details are important.
So these guys are trying to understand if the boy did it or there's a reasonable doubt?
I hope we see more Luna in season 3.

This guy voiced Piglet, the man with the high-pitched voice.

Everything I try in either looks bad or is too expensive
thelonepony: the really need to take that rule off cuz its comming out in a week

when its out you can talk about it
Why so serious?
Now they seemed to have calmed down.
No, kinixys, that was Gary Burghoff. He'd have been 15 by the time this movie was released.
scout19_tf2: It needs to be ENFORCED the week earlier.
Yeah no spoilers.
And get stronger for each nearing day, scout19_tf2

RosePetal they couldn't get it to work
Weird...

Dunno
Roseluck`, they weren't eble to when the lights were off
RosePetal: it only turns on with the lights
The old man reminds me of Ron Paul, and I think I see poliicts infront of me. :P
Guys this was before the computer age, they played games like toss crumpled paper into the fan
*able
PONY: as awesome as that sounds, I dont actually deal with explosives :D
12 angry men ,1 cup
Shoe shopping is the absolute worst
So we got a Baseball player, a NERD, a foreigner, a seventy something dude, a con-artist, a sensible guy, an angry guy, and some other guys
Things get a little stiffy around here when Boner is around.
TKist: XDD
Boom!
XD
thelonepony: well i dnt want to start a convo bout it im just saying itll be a great season
I'm not even sure why
ewww
But I hate it
Now they get angry again.
PONY: that statement sounds so wrong when you take away the capitalization :D
brb
Oh yeah. That can be a problem for me. My feet are annoyingly big, so it's hard to find shoes in my size.

Kandarihu It's clumsy, yeah
slum king knows his stuff
ah
i remember this movie! my civics teacher showed my class this back in 8th grade
In that case its Ham for us in english
handy man
That seems a bit more circumstantial.
3dry-cured ham that is usually thinly sliced and served uncooked
Your getting your fingerprints all over the murder weapon!
inacceptable!
I also remember having to watch this in school
This is getting really interesting
Depends, prosciutto is a different kind than just regular ham.
Wut?
you hwhat?
That's not the actual weapon, RosePetal. It's just another knife.
Yeah, was going to say its not the same ham we are probably not use to in the west
Oh.
Thats not how they thought me to take out sentries in the army
Why was there a user named "boner" here? -__-
Ahahahaha
Good question Pondoo.
This is a pretty good movie.
You think?
Now, he's angry.
I'm part Italian, so I'm very aware of it.
Panda: I have no idea. -_-

i dont think its race
wow they can't even stand to look at him, that's powerful scenery
hi guys, back from the movie
They've had enough of your shit #10!
It's a Klingon discommendation ritual. All that's missing is for them to cross their arms in front of their chests.
its about the caste
....they're giving him the cold shoulder? XD
hello FlutterMEDIC
I think this scene is about prejudice in general.
PONY: YOU WILL NEVER CATCH ME HAHAHAHAHA
They just gave Larson some cider and an AJ "Drink Cider, Be Responisble" shirt
did they specify his race?
He's Classist <- Not sure this word exist
And the one man who is logical listens.
And it was discovered 20 years later that the kid was guilty... :p
Notice how he's not yelling.
cant believe bronystate and Celsetia Radio are getting together
its only ironic that its the 50s USA.
oh, snap!
Juror 3: you no longer have a family or a name.

CrimsonPhoenix, I see what you mean about being overrated. When we can't watch a regular episode that FiW parodied without every joke from the parody being quoted, yes. That's too far.
On the crowd stand? I think so
But Berry Punch was in the crowds
CrimsonPhoenix: thats actually mud on the hat
I think I saw Cerry Berry
Vivix: No, in the race :P
"why wont you cross the sentinence scanner?"

Can't stop laughing.. ouch my ribs..
the shark was picked up by Sandy and thrown 10 thousand feet into the air
lol nope Invi SpeccyRush
TKist: Gigan+Megalon are best Tag Team in Godzilla
She's fondling that weapon a bit too much.

I love how that guy was the only one who just happens to look then and says HOLY SHIT
God I need to talk more ponies in here into voting for MegaPirahna. We need more Syfy gold like this xD
2012 was alright

This reminds me of the Bat Shark Repellant contained in the Bat Copter
Invi: Gigan has a saw in his stomach. Your Argument is invalid
A dinosaur.
Dat giant tooth.
Vordox: Sweet Sweet Cheezus
FlareChaser, but destoroyah has a laser in his stomach
Even she is questioning this logic.
MEGALODON!
OMG
Uh, that tooth on the computer looks nothing like the tooth she removed from the wound.
THAT HORRIBLE CREATURE! I do NOT want to see it again!
Nice try.
Vordox: CHEEZUS CRISP
LIved off giant birds evidently.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Megalodon_tooth_great_white_shark_teeth_.jpg real Megalodon tooth with modern shark teeth
Invi: Destoroyah is stronger since it's the mutated form of the very weapon which killed the first godzilla. So it's in a whole other level of power.
CriticKitten, that DOCTOR Professor Idiot
Another plane, let's hope the shark doesnt eat the plane.

This movie doesnt make much sense plot wise
Vordox: If Godzilla hadn't been on his Mega Power Meltdown, Destoroyah would have won. But just from the number of Victories, MechaG wins.
