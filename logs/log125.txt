wet coolers?
not a lot, just reading before I go to bed
I worked in produce, so wet greens and stuff like that
ah
sounds.. fun?
so they stay fresh
Mhm, I used to ride pallet jacks and throw pallets around too :3
you were the fresh provider
i would like that
It was nice.
one time at work we had fun noodles lying around for god knows what
so i hid and when people walked by i bonked them with it
Plus one of my coworkers was a fellow brony and we talked alot, so it was better.
totally, lol
That would be awesome to have at work, a fun noodle.
idk where it went though
haha and on april fools day i was messing with everyone's phones and computers
and they all got me back because the admin acted all angry and called me into the office
then april fool'd me and i didn't notice half of hte building standing behind me because i was scared shitless
I'm sure you were thinking you were screwed when that happened?
she told me to fix her computer and was like. if you have time to do this then you have time to do your work
.....APRIL FOOLS
....................................heh
At least your coworkers and superiors were able to joke around!
yah it's a nice place to work
well
half the time
my supervisors actually want to take me out drinking
and i have with a couple of them a few times
perks of a small town
downside of a small town: no bronies
brony's?
no
ies
Yeah, ies.
ok im gonna go have a smoke
Alright, see ya then
So..
Lonely, I'm so lonely, everybody, on my ownnnnn
/me appears
:O
Hmmmmmmm?
Hai there
0Ahoy
So..
0So...
/me 0hugs everypony g'night
Good night Nat
0Later
/me hugs Nat back.
well that was fun
dungeons and ponies and all that
Dungeons and ponies?
we had an impromptu dnd thing going on
0Indeed, though I'd much rather have Aberrate as a first-level spell than Magic Missile, just for the lulz.
The Janitor took care of some piles of trash.
And Samule Jackson is a paladin of justice
^-- Samule reminds me a bit of The Tick.
Sounds like it was interesting
0Any Gall is a sorcerer who exists to irritate the paladin
/me needs to figure out how to get his dicebot working
0I need to find a DM who will allow me to use my own class.
which is?
0The Pimp
ah, isn't that a bard?
Sounds like it.
0More like a bard-paladin hybrid
That or Rogue.
Paladin?
0He prays the Pimp's Prayer to imbue his hand with holy power, granting him an unarmed smite attack
^ very true
0and gains the effects of leadership at 6th level for free, so long as he buys and retains ownership of a brothel.
0There are a few other abilities that the class gets, but pretty much all of them require him to be under the effects of his prayer to function properly.
Uh-oh, we need to bring the chat back to life!
/me performs CPR
Live!
uh...
I think rarity is a better pony than fluttershy
that'll do it
KanyeEast! You're alive!
In what way?
Uh-oh, KanyeEast is delusional!
Hang in there buddy!
I like rarity scenes more, she's more funny and is more interesting
I will give you that point.
I like everypony. :P
I feel like the troll in that one comic
Twilight, Fluttershy and Rarity are my three favorites
Twilight is mai waifu, Fluttershy preys on my protective instincts, and Rarity is the most entertaining when she loses her mind.
Is it pony time yet?
Let me check.
a few more days
Yeah, definitely.
What about now?
no nappa
Better drink my own piss. :(

CURSE YOU JAYSON THIESSEN
Listening to that interview didn't help anything.

Well I eat hands and I kill people, that's 2 things.
I've only seen one episode of Charlie.

My stomach was making the rumblies, that only hands could satisfy :3

So now Charlie will please go into the candy cave *explodes*
They made ponies awesome, so they can make sea ponies awesome
You're late to the punch, Dari
But thanks, it's an amazing interview
also, >mi cara cuando there's a Star-2 tag on EqD
thats sort of...something to be proud of I suppose
>mi cara cuando you can't see mi cara cuando
Yup
wait thats cupcakes
Cupcakes has 4 stars on EqD
Be right back
I meant more like infamy level
yeah. Or Spiders
When I hear the word Cupcakes I think of Pinkie Pie's song from Call of the Cutie. Even though I have read the fanfic
I didn't read it, because I like to avoid nightmares
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOVDu7etQlc <-- hmmmmm
That song needs to be extended. Such an awesome and catchy song that lasts only 25 seconds
and i'm out
good night guys
Good night then
Oh hai Nittany
Hi.
A thunderstorm sounds nice right now
rain? rain?
it doesn't rain here.
rain? what is this rain? we have none of this 'rain' of which you speak
Rain, lightning, thunder, snow, all sounds good, though a clear night sky is nice.
only vodka
so basically... you don't care what you get, TS?
Eh, not really.
The cores of them are going to slip SE of me, though.
Wow, I actually like storms.
Same here.
But if they kick out my internet they go on my hit list.
That and the power too
I remember a lightning storm we had here near my college.
I like storms too.
Wow, it was amazing.
I continuously captured pictures with my camera in hopes that I would capture something at the right moment.
Got a lot of good pictures that night.
Do you have an SLR with variable exposure?
No, but I had an iPhone 4 >_<
Lol.
I got some amazing pictures with the camera.
Even with the right camera, it's tricky.
It helped being able to continuously capture photos
I remember when I used a cheap 35mm film camera to try and catch lightning. Never caught a thing. The shutter was fast.
Or something.
But I would pick up nothing.
Mom gets me an SLR, and I finally pick up three bolts weeks later.
Haha nice!
Yeah.
My best two days of lightning photography were in May 2010 in Kansas City and State College in 2008.
Those were very lightning-active storms.
So guys, good night.
Later.
Here's one of my images I took that night
http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/189/photo1rif.jpg/
Wow.
Did it work?
Yeah.
http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/25/epiclightningwatermarke.jpg - Kansas City.
Actually, to be honest, I don't even think that was an iPhone 4 haha
I think it was my old iPhone 3G
Oh darn
That's
That's definitely not an iPhone camera lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXhSuOmIpSo
Well, that was a scary song.
Anyway, that was a nice pic.
Thanks, yours as well.
The storm was just about to come on top of us so I had to literally run back to my dorm room haha.
But it was definitely a night to remember.
Hopefully I'll get to see it again, but it's been a while since then.
Yeah.
That night in State College, I was out in the storm while it was well too close.
The constant thunder was putting pressure on my eardrums.
I had to pull myself away from the action and get inside.
And no stream... Oh, well...
Kencolt: Be sure to check back on Friday for Movie Night and the big Season 1 Marathon up until the premiere of Season 2
Oh, I just KNOW that's going to WRECK me.
Haha, I have to go to the store to pick up some Rockstar/Red Bulls for that night.
I'm going to bed now. Night.
At my age... ow, that's going to wreck me...
Night Nittany_Tiger
Well, as long as you don't have school/work on Saturday, just sleep during that day haha
Um. 53. Kinda older than most. POny OR wolf.
I plan on staying up all night and then just crashing as soon as the premiere for Season 2 ends
Never too old for Ponies haha.
Yes. I am 53-- 54 in two months. Old for a brony or a browoof or a browhatever.
SuperBrony64: That sounds about like what I plan on doing Friday night.
EspyLacopa: Friday night is 24/7 Pony Time for me
Luckily, that's what e DVR is for...
Well…in spirit that is :P
Otherwise that statement wouldn't make any sense...
Definitely Kencolt
It will be seen.
However, in my apartment, with Netflix and Hulu, I haven't found the need for cable
This has been my critical point
And unless Ms. Faust has chosen poorly, it will be awesome.
So, my only access to Season 2 (beyond purchasing the episodes) will be through this stream
She definitely has yet to let anyone down
Ah. I live through Cable. Cable Modem, Cable TV, Cable phone... and Xfinity on demand to get my occiasional Dr. Who fix.
I've seen the preview clip for Season 2 and, without spoiling anything, it definitely lives up to what the show has put out over this past season.
Q.
Or close to it.
I'm the exact opposite.
I don't think I've watched TV (cable, not including internet) once for a couple of weeks now
I live off of Netflix and Hulu
And on occasion (MLP), YouTube
dear god that was disturbing
what?
What?
You read Cupcakes or something?
no i watched the latest marble hornets
Oh, wel... I'm off-- so many sites to check outt before I sleep...
What is that about?
Okay, later Kencolt
the latest one
?
I mean, what is it about?
marble hornets in general?
Are they an insect?
no its just the name of a web series
its a slender man series
its called marble hornets cause the creators wanted it to sound like a pretentious college student art filn
film*
Oh okay.

its a creepy scary series
not something to watch at night
That's a cool picture DecapKing

im confused, is his name DJ-PON3 or Vinyl Scratch
DJ-PON3 is the stage name
ah thanks
i couldn't sleep last night thinking about it
My favorite fanart: http://operatorchan.org/r/src/r15955_Vietnam%20Pony%20Spike.jpg
0o.o
That's sad, in a way.
Which is why I like it.
this is the best interview ever
apparently the creators are all pumped up from the fandom
thats cause MLP Vietnam is awesome
Evening chat

Which consisted of Java :P
Calculus is easy stuff.

ctrlx: I'm not a good self tutor
Don't worry, I'll give you free tutoring haha
I'm not responsible to keep up with my studies
Awesomeshy, me neither. i hyper-focus

lol
Ask me a question, I might be able to help you with it
Have you heard of Cramster?

SuperBrony64, i'm not on it right now but i will keep you in mind when i am on it
Saved me a number of times before
Geometry? Good luck with that :P
Hardest class ever
I wonder why that German fan dub of Mare in the Moon got taken down from YouTube?
Right next to Probability and Statistics

SuperBrony64, i don't think we're compatible, but i still love you <3
Awesomeshy, lol i haven't actually used it since like 8
i never wanted to touch kismet after i used it for a school project
ctrlx: The internet won't keep us apart. WE'LL FIGHT THE ROMANCE WAR! *wind blows*
DecapKing, aircrack is better
ctrlx: I always have to run it in a virtual machine to help out some friends
SuperBrony64, ohno ITS BLOWING TOO HARD
/me blows away
NOOOOOOO
And...
Awesomeshy, yah i have like 5 vmware machines
Scene
i just used kismet cause i was doing scripting for a map inside of UDK
Okay, hopefully this time it stays stable
Good work people, let's take it from the top!
lolwat
DecapKing, i got a wardrive app on my android that exports to kml (google earth file)
My connection's kinda unreliable
wha??

it's fun going places and wiresharking on my phone
Really?! What planet have you visited using it.
?
DecapKing, android phone. :3 you just walk along and it maps out AP's on google maps for you
or drive along
how did we get from UDK to google maps?
I'll stick with my iPhone TYVM
i thoguht udk was a place
soudns like a place
United Duck Kingdom?
UDk-Unreal Development Engine
Used for a popular game bearing a similar name...
you were using kismet for an unreal map?
i am interested
unreal kismet to do all of the scripting
it was an objective based map
basically get from point A to point B before time runs out or die
so not kismet the wireless packet capture software?
nope
lol
that's where we went wrong
different kismet
Awesomeshy, are you a mod?
Trying to figure out what the colored icons mean next to certain user names...

Oh wow
Was I away that entire time?
Nope nvm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE7jcRCIIkY
I love Space Core
i actually watched that entire video >.<
Oh wow, that's some dedication
well, listened to it
Interesting stuff
I like learning new things.
But in actuality, I never left.
back
I'm thinking of just going with debian
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHy7DGLTt8g&feature=related
and throwing Awesome WM on there
You're back to being awesome again!
ohai
So what do you do as Server Administrator?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0&feature=related
stuff
everything said in this video
Pretty awesome server stuff, huh?
yup
I noticed
we set it up
you can pick your favorite pony
Really? That's cool!
in #anime we have Applejack :v
what the pony server thing?
So, it replies as if it was Applejack or something :D
no
Oh :<
:c that would be p cool though
So, it's just a bot that does nothing...
it's just a pony instead
we also plan to eventually use them for a statistic
on which is best pony
later on when we have more users
Fluttershy…duh
lololo
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6RbEOlqRo
But anyway, what's the point of the other channels?
the other channels?
#anime…among others
Not everone's from bronystate, we plan to host a lot of different site's channels
each having their own channel
Interesting stuff
it'd be kinda messy
if everyone was in one room
What was even more interesting was the 18+ RP Pony Channel that was on here a few days ago
the throttle bot thing works fine
ahahaha
What was that about?!
I don't even, it was on bronychat too
We don't judge here though, we just service
and giggle to ourselves
True
Lo all.
sounds like fun
BUT THINK OF THE CHILDREN!?
that's the whole reason
it says 18_
Oh okay
18+
I'll just put a sign on my door and say, you can only enter if you live in this apartment. To hell with the lock system.
xfd
Ooh Ehm Gee
It's late X_X
Eeyup
technically it's early for some people
I didn't accomplish a damn thing all day :(
I went to class…but what's the point?!
Oh well, time to roll some dice in #anime
http://www.youtube.com/watch?src_vid=hPJwDuxti7k&v=EUCGD1aztw0&feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_654708
lololo
If only the graphics were really that good in the game
!roll 5d40
Aww….:(
Also
This place scares me
I'll idle in here and afk
and when I get back there's like
2k unread messages
Activity scares you?
I don't usually idle in really active rooms
tl;dr scares me
lulz tl;dr
Need to create some kind of Death Clock...
wat
A clock that calculates the exact time of death
We need a bot for that
That allows you to retweet it to your followers with a Tweet button
Our bot policy is p loose
reminds me of "The Machine of Death"
Then there you have it
I just gave you an idea
nope
you should give that idea to someone who wants it :v
Okay then
/me gives idea to Awesomeshy
donotwant.jpg
/me throws it at DecapKnight
returntosender.jpg.exe
oh u
/me nukes it from orbit
/me hax.jpg.exe.py
lol, you should compile that shit
or DecapKnight's idea
why would I compile a python script that's silly
Cause it's the law
this is silly I'm done
Okay, time for some role playing
You walk into the middle of a forest, you see a sign up ahead, what do you do?
The fog starts to creep in from the north, you stand before the sign now. What do you do?
You stand there motionless all the while thinking, "What a horrible night to have a curse". The sign still lays before you. What do you do?
You were eaten by a Grue. Game Over.
/me 0is eaten by a grue
0o.o
You would you like to play again? Type Y for yes or N for no.
heloo
0Somehow I knew that was going to happen.
Invalid selection, type Y for Yes or N for No.

You walk into the middle of a forest, you see a sign up ahead, what do you do?
0take sign
You now have the sign. Now what?
0go west
You are now facing west. Now what?
0go north
You are now facing north. Now what?
0cut down trees
woah it's all different
You do not have an axe. Now what?
0use sign
Hitting the tree with your sign causes the sign to break. It is no longer legible. Now what?
0continue north
Walking north, you notice a whisper in the air as if it was a calling to you. The trees a numerous in this forest aplenty. You approach a fork in the road along with another sign. Now what?
0take sign
You take the sign. Before you lies a hole where the sign used to be. Now what?
0go left
You turn towards your left. You are now facing West. Now what?
0continue west
You decide to walk west, disregarding the warning on the sign telling you not to do so. As you walk, the trees grow in number and they give off a frightening vibe as you pass them. In front of you lies a metal gate guarding the entrance to an old castle. To your right is a mailbox. To your left is an old shack that seems abandoned. Now what?
0open mailbox
Opening the mailbox breaks the lid off. Disregarding it, you look to find an envelope. It doesn't have any writing on it, but it has an unusual heft to it. Now what?
i thought about doing this sort of thing with me on my phone and people telling me what to do
0take mail
kill a snail
0(I did this to people on omegle once. Every path eventually led to them being eaten by a grue.)
You grab the envelope and stow it away in your bag. You now face the gate. To your right is a broken mailbox. To your left is an abandoned shack. Now what?
0take mailbox
destroy mailbox
You pull the mailbox out of the ground and stow it away in your bag. Before walking away, you notice a bright flash of light coming from the hole that contained the mailbox.
Now what?
0inspect light
piss on the bright light
^ typical move
you know it
Inspecting the light, you see that it is actually the glare causes by a golden key. It has no markings on it other than the initials B.G. Take the key?
0take key
throw the key into a river
You grab the key and stow it away in your bag. You now turn to face the gate. To your left is an abandoned shack. Now what?
0enter shack
throw mailbox at shack
The door to the shack is locked. You look through the window to see a light emanating from the inside. Now what?
"ZORKS!" - shaggy
kick down door
0open door
suddeny rpg.
The door to the shack is locked. Looking below the knob, you see a keyhole. Now what?
use Awesomeshy to open door
0use mailbox
^ great use of a mailbox
wat
xD
you need to open the door
oh
ok
/hax open door
Inserting the mailbox into the keyhole opens the door. Inside you find an old oil lantern that's lit. However, the shack is empty. All you see is a table that has a book on it laying open.
WTF?!??!?!?!?!??!?!
0take lantern
HOW?
0(XD)
did you even ring the doorbell? where are your manners?
FUCK YOU TEXT BASED RPG!
You grab the lantern. Before you lies a book on the table. Now what?

0take book
throw burning book at a Grue
0http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pwned.png
wtf is a grue?
Closing the book up, you blow the dust off the cover and stow the book away in your bag. Seeing nothing else of use, you walk back outside facing the gate. Now what?
0return to shack
steal a car
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.
0(I'll tell you when I'm done in here, dang it!)
You turn to see the shack has disappeared. Puzzled, you turn back towards the gate. Now what?
0What.
steal a fucking car!
0open gate
"What" is not a logical command
I'm surprised anypony is still awake
>>;
I am Fluttershy
I'm surprise /I'm/ still awake
/me 0hugs `Fluttershy
and ive been knighted!
/me is hugged ^^ hey
You walk over to the gate and see that it is locked up tight. No amount of force will open it up. However, you see there is a tiny hole small enough to fit a key. Now what?
/me gently hugs `Fluttershy
0use book
You grab out the book and open its cover. Begin reading book?
Are you guys rping?
o-o;
0read entire book
yes they are
did you see my poke spam?
you just being in this chatroom puts you at risk of being eaten be a grue
0(SuperBrony64 is now a Zork-style text-based RPG :P)
0(Who, me?)
omg I come back to a Zork reference
<3
You begin to read the book. "See Spot". You turn the page. "See Spot Run". You turn the page. "Run Spot Run". You reach the back cover of the book and close it. The book disintegrates. Before you the gate opens up without and force pushing on it.
wtf?
Sense, this RPG makes none.
Now what?
and ohay ponies
:D i still couldn't figure out how to move when i tried to play lol
-laughs-
Wow.
I wonder what time it is where you guys are.
Must be pretty tired to do something so random.
well.. to the house
0(I've played this game before. I know all the tricks. The key is a trap.)
0take gate
aw, no hello? no hugs? no free ice cream?
/me 0hugs RobotPinkie
i should give it another shot now that i think about it again though
I was especially looking forward to the ice cream, tbh
0(Sry, this game is intense XD)
lol
/me hugs GrimGallop
The gate is bolted down to the ground. It will not move without so extra force. Before you you see a person standing before you in a hooded outfit. To your left, you see a mail box. To your right, you see a strange looking plant with a keyhole. Now what?
BITCHSLAP THE STRANGE FIGURE!
0take hooded outfit
BronyState... never inactive.
If BronyState were a person they'd be a very happy one.
0(Not while SuperBrony and I are here!)

posting my spamz
The sign post in your bag has caught fire. You try to roll around to put it out but it's of no use. Your charred body lays there. Game Over.

I LIKE PIE!

0leave forest
bad idea
AH
MOVIE YOU POSTED
seizure inducing
>>
You walk away from the forest and enter into the sun drenched meadow. You forget why you were even in the forest in the first place. You return back to your home. The End.
you want to see a seizure inducing vid?
i wanna see kamina play through zork
0Woot. I win.
i need some time to find the original version of that pokemon seizure episode
why wub NIN
-glomps RobotPinkie-
yay!
You forgot to lock the door to your house. You were eaten by a Grue. Game Over.
DecapKnight: no I do not want to see seizure inducing vid
/me hugs `Fluttershy
0What.
oh
dun dun duuuuuun
yours is the drill that will pierce through this door!
why did you say seizure inducing vid then?
The quick flickering is kinda bad... but I love the music
0I don't remember that being in this game. Must be something the developers put in to screw with people that pirated it x.x
fffuuu

/me 0gives `Fluttershy a potato
You walk into Ponyville, you put on your wizard hat and robe...
you're welcome `Fluttershy
I'm a guy, because Pinkie is a manly suffix.
im a dude
cause im a King
Pinkie Pie is teh bomb.
Don't dis pink.
It takes a real man to wear pink.
i own a pink shirt.. that's gotta count for something
I like Pinkie Pie
I love pink
But I truly believe Fluttershy is one of the best Ponies.
I prefer to wear black
I believe she's one of the 6 best ponies, definitely
Agreed.
Hmmm. I have pic for you.
thats cause Fluttershy has the squee
*squee*
because the Mane 6 are awesome
Twilight and Pinkie Pie both have the *squee* as well

y u nom your own leg? You're not Scoota!
0And with me being unspeakably chaotic neutral (with evil tendencies), I clearly show up as a villain...
Sumica: I still have no idea what are you be talking about.
I was just listening to this SuperBrony64
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNgTyr9LFqE&feature=related
im Chaotic Good!
0Which makes Silvermane my MORTAL ENEMY!
Thought you sent some art in to BronyState today.
Wow, that's awesome Awesomeshy!
fluttershy y u have a ` infront of your name?
Because... =_= mane 6 names are reserved for friggin bots
so I couldn't use my original name
D:
If you haven't done this yet, you're not a true Brony: http://youtu.be/KH5TR6dtVzU
/me headbangs
0Well, that seems horribly inconvenient.
but... i haven't yet
MeteorVenture: Uh-oh...
I havent
Can I help you sir? This is a chat for Bronies...
but i have no money
i did ask mom to take me to mcdonalds a long time ago after it was definitely over though.. it took me that long to actually ask lol
and i live in the country
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ycU3d_gZw
does that mean I'm not a real brony? because I don't have money for merch... u_u
I want those McDonalds toys now :/
i hear there are some over in mexico now
`Fluttershy: Actually yes, but you can't be a brony cause you said you were a girl.
Being a brony isn't about how much money you have...
....
/me slaps SuperBrony64
Quiet, you :P
/me punches SuperBrony64
it's apparently about if you have merch or not
Twinkle twinkle little st--*falls over*
I have 9 brushables... Is that too much, or too little?
Woah, you're hoarding all the brushables?!
Hey everyone! This RobotPinkie guy took all the G4 PONIES!!
you're not a true brony if you don't have over 10000 unique pony pictures in your pony folder
I'm collecting them. I only have half though. :(
lawl MeteorVenture
i have only 100 D:
i only have none
You're not a true brony if you don't have Fluttershy as your wallpaper.
lol i do have over 10000 after deleting duplicates and saving a few more
a few more i didn't have of course
I have two wallpapers right now
one with Princess Luna and one with Pinkie Pie
i still have that normal windows wallpaper "bliss"
I have Derpy, RD and Fluttershy
I have no regrets.
0I have the bliss wallpaper being invaded by Konata
but i have had rainbow dash as my facebook avatar for a while now.. oh ya! you're not a true brony if you.. something
What like from luckystar?
0Yeah.
Goddamn, I love gODHEAD sometimes...
You're not a true brony if you don't eat 100 muffins every hour.
0What.
challenge digested
0 2.4k muffins a day.
0No.
i now have a fallout 3 wallpaper
Normandy 2 is my wallpaper. People like to use my system >_<
muuuuufffinnnzzz
If you go "muffiiiiiiiiiiiiins" whenever you see muffins, you might be a brony
I am the milkman. My milk is delicious.
If you tell your friends you'll be back in 10 seconds flat instead of "be right back", you might be a brony
RobotPinkie... i do lol
it's like grim is whispering sweet nothings into our chatroom
0I should delete the wallpaper folder I got from a friend and have never used and replace it with every MLP wallpaper I can find.
MeteorVenture, use this!
http://i.imgur.com/hynzs.jpg
0O.o
lol
lol
My milk is fortified for what the world wants. What the world deserves.
If you have to make a reference to Rainbow Dash every time someone sings "Double Rainbow", you might be a brony
0Is there a widescreen of that? XD
Anyone who gets this reference gets a muffin.
http://www.hdwallpapers.in/wallpapers/fallout_3_game-1280x720.jpg This is my current wallpaper
Isn't that Psychonauts?
dat watermark
That wallpaper you have Turgle is too low resolution.
RobotPinkie: You get a muffin.
Ive got a MSpaint image of rarity and rainbow dash
One of the best goddamn games in the world
Fallout?
http://www.animuchan.org/w/src/131425456075.png
my desktop
If anything deserves an HD remake... it's Psychonauts.
0Want.
i want to see a remake of Fallout and Fallout 2
If you go into a toy store, and you sweat just thinking about whether or not to walk into the My Little Pony section, you might be a brony.
THIS is a wallpaper
http://www.tiger-pictures.net/cute-siberian-tiger.jpg
0CAT
Turgle: that's so lowres
OH
yeah
Who wants to see my awesome wallpaper?
http://wallpaper4me.com/images/wallpapers/ragelandscape-411279.jpeg This was my wallpaper forever
I did the pic myself
my screen is lowres too
0My cat sleeps on my desk. Usually on my arm so I can't operate my mouse properly.
Who wants to see eeeet?!
GrimGallop, http://i.imgur.com/GGr20.jpg
Crap, gimme min
THIS is a wallpaper http://www.imageafter.com/dbase/textures/walls/b1wallbrick04.jpg
If your portable music player is more than 50% pony music, you might be a brony
0Lol
Show us `Fluttershy
that wallpaper
If you have a blind bag Pinkie Pie with you as a good luck mascot for exams, you might be a brony
my glorious wallpaper
DecapKnight looks like somthing from FMA
Full Metal Alchemist?
`Fluttershy: that's gatta be pixelated as hell
yeah
Oooh, I like it
0I always wanted to try out alchemy, but I heard learning all the cool stuff would cost me an arm and a leg...
lol GrimGallop
I have a bigger version
that I use
o-o
but It's only on my computer
Hey everyone, It's been fun doing stuff and whatnot. HOWEVER, I do need to get some sleep. Good night everypony!
the original image size is like...
SuperBrony64: get out
1200 pixels by 900
Ouch.
0Later, SuperBrony
I bring happiness to all and this is what I get?!
:<
kbai
/me cries
(ilu SuperBrony64)
<3
0Hm. I have a FMA background :O
night night SuperBrony64
hey who wants to hear a addictive song =p
decap... killed me
hey!
sure, Sumica
I tried to revive you!
He did? how?
But you didnt take the pills!
0Of course. Decapitation usually does kill ponies...
sure sumica.. can't have enough addiction
0http://i51.tinypic.com/30uutrm.jpg
You might know it already RobotPinkie
http://ponyvspony.artix.com/
Haha, oh yeah :D
that title song.
OH FMA STUFF
I LOVE FMA
LOVE
LOVE
LOVE IT
FullMetal Alchemist?
0^_^
Which one `Fluttershy?
Both.
Original and Brotherhood.
ah
FOR THE BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL!
Me too, though I think I prefer Brotherhood... kind of a lot
I fell in love first with original...
but Brotherhood does kick ass
sticks to storyline
and has Vic Migogna!
>>
Yeah, I've read the first 6 or so volumes of the manga
read it online
was horrified when I realized there was more to the story than the anime
then was amazed
I kinda hope they remake Naruto once the manga is finished...
then watched brotherhood
The Brotherhood of Steel has giant suits of bloody power armor and fucking Gatling lasers!
because the Naruto anime is so incredibly bad most of the time :(
0How long would it be then, Pinkie? :P
I had a friggin' FMA craze...
it was almost as bad as my current MLP phase
I dunno, maybe a 10th as long as the current one?
0So about 200 episodes?
this pony song is sadistic
Naruto is "only" about 400 episodes :P
0Sounds delightful. What song is that? :D
http://ponyvspony.artix.com/
0It's still ongoing, isn't it?
So a good version of what's happened thus far would be 3 seasons or something, lol
Yeah...

oh wow, really? :O
lol
rainbow unicorn ponies? that's not how you say pegasi
0I feel like I should get a bunch of metal for when I'm playing WoW, because it seems like an appropriate genre for a tank.
FUCK THE TANK!
LOL an actual tank
My favorite Fear Factory song is the one they did with B-Real
SRSLY
LOL TANKS IN WOW!
it makes perfect sense to me
they can drive you in close
so you can hit them with your sword
i lol'd
and with that. i retire for the night.
0Exactly.
later guys

goodnight:D

0Later, ctrlx
0lol
0So. Anyone ever decided to watch something based on an AMV? :P
Yeah
since i don't really watch AMV's.. i don't think so.. first one i remember REALLY enjoying was a PMV
Gintama
0:O
/me 0waits for video link
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll0gxOp1LWY This video
It's not that good, but I love the song and the show looked good. :P
I mean the AMV isn't that good.
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV7AzNYh5bo <- This one for me :D
0That one for me :P
and Gintama is pretty damn awesome, btw
so.. the chat is supposed to be white now right? and if so can i change it back?
0Looks delightfully brutal ^_^
It's also delightfully hilarious
and I like that Soul Eater AMV
0Wonder if I can watch that on Netflix through teh Xbox...
Gintama? No idea.
and I have no idea about the colors, MeteorVenture
but the chat did change how it looks right?
not sure if it's just me or not
Cant say for sure I use a stand alone program.
checking mibbit
It's black for me
8,03I meen i could rape your eyes for a moment.
huh.. i'll screenshot.. also i can't see what grim says and i have to highlight it all cause it's white and blends in with the BG
The Ice Age 4
why
why
why
That's weird.
and lol Turgle
0I haven't said anything since I mentioned Netflix :O
/me sighs
Son, I am disappoint
0Oh, snap, server's back up. I could finally level up my druid if I felt like bothering to log on by now XD
(also: Top Gun in 3D)
oki sleep time now
0D:
bye Sumica !
What is up with GGgala
this is basically what the chat looks like http://www.tineye.com/query/5d1a52e8c9187c593221382e1f677d3acc83a8f6
0A 404 error?
i need a smaller screenshot
150x120
that's my max resolution you jerk
150x120?
lol
lol
huh.... that's weird
jk though
but ya it also has a different layout
I really have no idea why it does that
it shows "chatting" people and "idlers"
i'm thinking my window loaded wrong
which page are you on?
.co.cc?
yep it loaded wrong
oh, it works now?
ya it's back to normal
Good
Maybe he has a bad connection too?
it was really annoying to highlight everything grim said lol
after i realized he wasn't spamming nothing
yeah but
lawl
that many clones
I think you can just hover your mouse pointer over someone's name to highlight
but yeah it's annoying
wow that'd be too smart
i don't like touching my mouse either though.. too much work
work that i otherwise don't need to do
lol yeah, had to do it when Val became a mod, before he had a background color
0So why was I the only one you had to hover over? o.o
your white text
0The white that everyone else has? XD
It's not the same white, lol
all else had black text lol
0Everyone's white-on-black for me
yours stayed white probably cause it's specified to be white i guess
If you've chosen the white on the menu, it's different
isn't life interesting?
Indeed!
interesting but understandable
Well, ponies.
You can't explain that.
0Ponies OuO
Ponies come in, ponies go out
never a miscommunication
lol i never shunned ponies.. i figured out that i was probably gonna be a brony pretty quickly.. i just can't remember exactly how it went
i was on /b/ looking for something entertaining like FBF or something but found that instead
i never go on /b/ except when i do
http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pokmon-overkill1.jpg
It's been a hectic summer for me, so I don't remember the exact times, lol
well i've been around since late january or early february or something
i have pictures on the PS3 saved with those times
Not me. But I do like ponies.
eh can't REALLY help not hearing about something
I haven't been on 4chan much lately
ya i don't like the place despite having gone there sometimes.. and i still go there alot less now.. i guess it's cause i have much more entertaining things to do elsewhere now
0Like ponies? :D
yes lol
also i find it funny how different things are in those threads than on ponychan.. i see around ponychan alot of the same images reposted and such.. but on the threads on 4chan there's a whole different set of those
dat cultural difference
Why are there so many ponies awake? European?
yep
0Nope
._____.
duuude
so how's usagi drop? i told you i'd ask lol
the name reminds me of like.. cough medicine
uhm
xD
yesterday night i felt asleep
so i didn't watch it yet
alright lol
:D
the art style looks like shoujo
but it's apparently the demographic says different
I've almost finished preparing for the move to college today, at seven am, in about four hours..
woah nm.. maybe it's just the manga
i have no idea.. thanks for being deceptive google images
0Since when is google deceptive?
when it shows a different art style than you actually ever see in said show
and generally ALL THE TIME
0...You win this round.
lol
0Seems like it's about time for me to get some sleep. Brb, need to catch a cat ^_^
grab him by the rainbow and pull him to you
/me 0has obtained one cat.
0I can't sleep without this guy in my room. The next closest thing to an alarm clock I have is my cell phone, and my cell phone doesn't have teeth that dig into my flesh until I go into the other room to feed it.
0Although it does play Final Fantasy victory music every 15 minutes until I turn it off...
i smell a money making idea
0Alarm clocks that inflict physical pain until they're sure you're awake? :D
lol yes
0http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/lights/8f1a/
0I think that'll do the trick :D
also "my cell phone doesn't have teeth that dig into my flesh until I go into the other room to feed it" so your cellphone grows teeth that dig into your flesh when you try to feed it?
i am unfamiliar with that model
also FF victory music is awesome:D
0Anyways, I should get to sleep before sunrise XD
alright well take care:D i hope i can stay awake for another long while.. i am already kinda tired
0lulz
/me 0vanishes into the darkness

my god
Steins;Gate
how can you be so good
Ponies and ponies and ponies and ponies
* - laugh at you.
laughs at "you"
Is it good?
A friend of mine was trying to get me to watch it
Actually
I'd go as far as to say it's my new favorite series
Hello Fluttershy
and they're in production of a movie to finish off the series
sleep?
Mmm. Maybe I'll get around to watching more than the opening then
what is this "sleep" you speak of?
lol
Are you going to sleep through Celestia's beautiful day? ...she might grow resentful, y'know
I like how they approach the time travel theory
and send your ass to the sun
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQdC-e82gmk
She might turn into a wicked mare of light
Sunstroke Star
as long as we can keep luna
and Fluttershy
and Spike who is the best pony evar
ofc, Luna will banish Celestia to the Sun for a thousand years
can we keep Fluttershy though?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYVPR-gBFk0
also who wouldnt want a GPS that sounded like this?
hello, Mr. Payne
Hello DecapKnight
or should I call you Max?
You are the first person to realize where my nic originates from
really?
Yah
thats pretty sad
i still havent played any of the Max Payne games yet though
Or at least first to verbally acknowledge
Been using this nic ever since 2001 when the First game came out
ive been using this nic since earlier tonight when i couldnt figure out how to get my other nic signed out
Those games are pretty good, although first one is pretty dated.
DecapKing?
what?
Did you check the Bronychat? I noticed that both Bronychat and Ponychat direct here...
i am on bronychat
So ponychat?
my god this is the best last episode
I've ever fucking seen
theres a ponychat?
Yeah, at least last night they changed IRC again to irc://irc.ponychat.net/bronystate
does a gray name mean that the user is afk?
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/287c39ace6d76700d6716fe87ed250db/55144%20-%20Team_Fortress_2%20big_macintosh%20fancy_mathematics%20heavy%20tf2.png Such a perfect description....
I think so...
wat?
Whoa
if you don't say anything for a while your name goes gray i think.. dunno all about it but i know i can come back and see my name gray despite being here until i talk
that's a lot of GGgala_s
Yeah, it's somewhat random really...
yup
there must be another way to go active because i've seen some people not talk for a long time and then not be gray
srsly
stoppit
i'm going to work
That too...
later, guys!
most servers ban users after anything more than 3 connections
perhaps it's as simple as them typing a command or pushing a button or even talking in a different chatroom
Brb MAG
alright take care turgle
I think he just has a terrible connection
that doesn't explain 4 different connections
it's as easy as registering your nick
and ghosting the old one
well, he is using chatzill && xchat
>chatzilla
he should probably stop using chatzilla....
ye
I bet every new firefox window he opens, it opens a new irc connection or something
that would be a mess :/
should probably just
stick with xchat or something
kvirc's p good
a terminal based irc user!
/me is slowly switching to terminal based programs
I used to use irssi, but Kabaka got me on weechat
so far I like it a lot better, but irssi's still really good
if i went to sleep now i hope i would be wide awake for the season 2 stream and the immediate aftermath
gotta fix my sleep schedule around what's important
yeah, I've heard good things about both
there's aspell support built into weechat
well my third day out of school this week
that's what got me sold actually
>__>
but I also like the python scripting support
idk what languages irssi supports
looks like perl
not that it matters a whole lot to me, I don't really know perl or python -.-
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/3766bb0d569911ea191ad42fafe7b608/48916%20-%202fort%20Ambassador%20Blu%20Bonbon%20Lyra%20Octavia%20Team_Fortress_2%20announcer%20comic%20corrected%20daisy%20demoman%20dispenser%20engineer%20facepalm%20fan_o_war%20fresh_prince_of_Bel_Air%20garry%27s_mod%20garrys_mod%20gmod%20heavy%20homewrecker%20howler_monkey%20intelligence%20m
HOLY SHIT
I could probably edit minor amounts of code just fine, but not create without looking at lots of documentation
Colgate: I don't know perl
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/1648709013202214d338da930191109e/49307%20-%20Team_Fortress_2%20applejack%20filly%20fluttershy%20heavy%20medic%20rainbow_dash.png
so the python support is nice for me
So much TF2
weechat supports perl, python, ruby, lua, and tcl
yup
eeeeeeyup
and dat fluttershy head
not that any of that helps, since I haven't coded in any of those languages
but at least it would give options later when I eventually pick up a scripting language
time to install UDK
UDK?
also
http://www.weechat.org/scripts/
Unreal Development Kit
I'm supprised that more people dont know what it is
164 scripts, quite a few
stuff like chanmon and highmon are super useful
http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/chanmon.pl.html/ | http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/highmon.pl.html/
I have a script for xchat that does something similar to highmon
I thought you already installed it
nah
I just downloaded it
i forgot about installing it
Ohh, yeah I hear it's good
I can't be expected to remember all game acronyms, though :P
its not a game
its a game development engine
that was used in multiple games
also uh
are you colgate from bronychat
or colgate from ponyirc

There's not many development kits of that magnitude that you can try for free

haha, it is.
didnt think this was gurren lagann
that theme

9HA HA
Well, I do love Shoko Nakagawa.
9TIME FOR JESUS MCBEAMSPAM
=s
Wait, what was that just now?
that was ttgl
No no, after the giga drill.
Burn in hell Kira
=|
Enemy died, back to map. . .then something happened.
9nobody likes Kira
How can you?
;x
9but the Strike and Freedom were cool
Meh
9who said I liked Jesus and Assram?
They were too hax
Even more so than usual.
9I like Shinn though
9also
Shinn was good.
He would've made a better main char.
9Gundam SEED Destiny was revindicated by SRW Z
9they basically rewrote the plot for these games
9the results were MUCH better
need Megas
Kira would've made a better antagonist.
:|
He's so unlikable.
KanyeEast: Yes, it does.
9people actually call out Jesus and Assram on their bullshit, ect.
oh hey, its robot batman
9remember that Player Character vs. Player Character thing I was saying earlier?
9it depends on whether you choose to side with Shinn or side with Kira and Assram
oh its code geass
Who is this guy with the green-hair girl and the fancy cape?
I thought his thing was a fancy eye power?
9this attack: ALL THE BUDGET
it seems like you're just wiping out all sorts of enemies. is there any challenge to this game?
it has giant robots too
9it is
9Kanye, there is. I'm just that good.
its like death note with giant robots and international politics
lol pretty much
I find it interesting how you're just kinda ignoring that one enemy amidst all your guys.
9one enemy is easy to defend against though
is eva in this game?
9but other SRWs have it
9I also own SRW MX
9which has EVA
9For the PSP
9thinking about streaming it sometime
which characters? shinji I assume?
Moon Punch!
9Shinji, Asuka, Rei, and Kaworu as a Time Diver
Wait, that's not a moon punch. . .is it?
9it's a moon punch with other things
oh shi
See, if you punched it too the moon, it wouldn't be counterattacking.
VOTOMS music never gets old.
how about G Gundam?
for erupting burning finger
Was that a bunny bot with a globe-face?
9G Gundam, not here, but also on M
9*MX
Meh, G Gundam.
How could they come up with that after Victory Gundam?
G Gundam was fairly awesome
>_>;
also needs transformers, they may not be piloted giant robots but they still count
Unicron?
and gigantor
Just give me f-ing Ideon.
=x
9Voltron/GoLion is in one of the DS games
Bunnybot!
they won't be able to get Transformers rights
9and IDEON is in F Final and Alpha 3
u_u
mezame ideon!
9also the reason Transformers hasn't been in SRW
whose this guy?
9is because it belongs to Takara-Tomy in Japan
is it just me, or is the stream kind of laggy for anyone else?
9and they're really privy with what they allow into SRW
No lag for me.
just you i think
I cant tell
damn
9they have just allowed GaoGaiGar and VOTOMs in so far
not listening to the sound at all
9and Kanye: a Banpresto Original unit
ah, shame. Optimus prime would probably have some interesting comments about all the giant robots
9as in, an Original Character for this game
it keeps on freezing up for me
9maybe someday
9Bamco will want to sell SRW in US
9and then they'd probably do everything to get Transformers in
oh there we go
just settled in
NO DAMNIT
Bamco? Sounds like a company made by Emerill.
9Namco Bandai then
9Harmonic Friendship Cannon
9YATTE YARUZE
oh hey
I know that voice
thats Franky from one piece
Heh
I'm pretty sure I haven't seen a tenth of these anime
all of these attacks look like they should end reality
yup, SRW doesn't know the meaning of holding back
and it just makes it all the more ridiculous when it does absolutely nothing XD
oh hey, surfboard robot anime
9we need a SRW that takes place in Equestria
Eureka 7
9and then Dash piloted Valks
I've seen this at least
I thought the main character was nearly as whiny as shinji
he is at times
9>Shinji
9>Whiny
so I watched ttgl instead
9y'all need to see Shinji in Alpha 3
so just clarifying, the plan is to stream the episode as it airs?
9Kira: WHINE WHINE WHINE
yes, with a entire lead up of season 1
all night
9Shinji: *SLAP* You're a man, aren't you? THEN FACE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A MAN!
9that actually happened btw
OMG
Alpha 3?
I love Eureka's voice. T_T
shinji said that? did he fuze with kamina?
So cute
really? I thought her English dub actor was a better fit
I am completely fucking lost
NO
No
No
:I
(which is rare)
all i know is there are giant robots
and it is awesome
true dat
9NIA WRIGHT!
9also he did because hey
Gurren Brigade!
and that they can survive things that would destroy nearly anything in the real workd
9over the spanse of three games
Go team gurren!
I recently heard her voice playing Cosette in the Les Miz anime adaption.
Man it was cute.
:x
9guys like Kouji and Ryoma just rubbed off on him
9he actually had good role models
9it did WONDERS for him
9he actually rejects instrumentality and tells Gendo to fuck off
Wait, who's Ryoma?
9Gendo's reaction?
9SON.
9I AM PROUD.
awesome, all shinji needed was some manly rolemodels.
9oh, and that was actually written by Hideaki Anno for SRW
9so it's sorta canon
...naw
9and Ryoma is the Getter's main pilot
As in, if Shinji had manly role models he'd actually be able to man up?
9this is the Getter
9pretty much
9the guy was broken from the lack of human interaction
9and felt unwanted
NERV should have invested in some psychologists
9then people want him to pilot the Evas and he doesn't have a say on it, and he doesn't want to
all giant robots should have capes
9if he actually WANTED to, he would kick all sorts of ass
9so then what happens when he has positive role models in his life?
9he wants to help those people
9the Eva becomes less of an obligation and more of a means for him to do what he wishes to do
so he can fuck bitches and make money
9cue him fucking shit up with a robot-sized katana
Not a chain-sword?
not every version of shinji can be the god emperor of mankind
what about a katana sized robot? http://contra.wikia.com/wiki/Browny
9here
9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4E1p6Ff5q0
9Shinji in all of his glory
WHO SAID CHAINSWORD?
All that only did /10/ damage?
9that's because I had a Spirit activated
9next enemy attack would do 10 damage
9and so on
9it's called Wall
/me hungers
this reminds me of ff7 and sephiroth casting meteor like 8 times
I lost track of how many times all the planets had been destroyed
9for these guys
9this is just another Tuesday
Gered's voice is kind annoying.

so, which pilots have the best will?
At the Gala
9will isn't a set stat
9it works like this:
9you start the battle with Will at Default 100
9cap is 150
hmm, what else have you got
9different battle actions raise your will differently
iie
=x
9ally kills an enemy? 1 Will. You kill an enemy? 5 Will. Got involved in a battle? 1 Will. And so on.
iiiiiyadaaaaa!
9many attacks have Will requirements
9Giga Drill Breaker needs 130 Will for example

Oh, you're streaming SRW again?
He did the same at the end of Victory Gundam with Katejina.
or is this a test going on?
If there are any australian bronies in here wondering,

does anybody know how to modify the color of your text using mirc?
oh sick. registered
3yay
*inhales* Yay~
0oops
9I do
9but colors are mod-only
i know
0got a warning
im asking for the D&P session
0derp
also
is it possible for us to create an official bronystate D&P chatroom?
9I think it was Ctrl + Color's number
but it requires you to keep doing that
9also we could provide the bot, but you'd better create it yourself
9we can't register more than ten rooms
9so we have to be wary of that limit
does it cost money? or some way?
or i just do the #...
9just the hashmark
alright cool
9you gotta register it like you'd register any channel though
how?
#themoon
9don't know very well
9also that's our ban appeal channel LOL
9try another name
we were using it for D&P yesterday, sorry
9it's kay
but making a channel, will that cost money in any way?
9nope
so how do i set up a channel?
9http://www.mirc-anleitung.de/IRC-register-channels.html
#Bronystate D&P
9try without the spaces
are underscores allowed?
9indeed they are
Is ze channel up, Mr Chang?
yes
holy shit Dresden Files ponyfic? I'm gonna have to read that...
so DCD
the template
You don't have to register a channel just to use it, though... right?
9yeah, the latter is fine
its no password and i dont wish to have a description
9you don't, but it might be better if you do
9mainly since I have to ask dari to get his bot there
Registering is useful so that it can't get hijacked.
so
its better if i do what?
have a PW?
9better if you register it, which you are already doing
ohay AllisZero
9yeah
Hey RP, how goes it
that means its registered, correct?
9I believe so, yes
it says im not logged in
Now you should be able to register the channel. :-)
You said you're using mIRC, right? You should have an option to give a password in your connection settings so that it does so automatically.
oh ok
lemme check
hold up
Heck, technically so does the full out Mibbit client on their website.
so i registered the server
is there a way to permanently mod myself?
because i lose it when i exit and re-enter the D&P room
9nice going, Dai-Guard!
9now do that one more time!
9nice!
nvm i got it :D
9one last dodge, Dai-Guard!
9aww yeah!
Back to the crappy connection speed, RobotPinkie
It's the VPN, it has to be
Ah okay, that's not fun
How's things otherwise?
Yeah, but I'm not sure if it's a problem on my side, or at home
heyall
They were working perfectly yesterday until I rebooted everything :(

9awww yeah, I love this attack
That's strange, AllisZero
okay
i got it working :D
so one more question
how do you switch your text color with mIRC?
the crtl K only works for 1 line
Yep, the speed is just abysmal
:(
I'm here to clog up servers and chew gum.
And-- Oh, hey, here's some gum.

Wait.. What VioletVanilla?
6Have you ever seen The Room Rainbow-Dash? ;3
6MrChang, I am using mIRC, what do you need help with?
Dat hyaku shiki
okay
i want to permanently change the color of my text
wait
colors are only for ops
i know colors here are mods only but, i got permission from DCD
:D
I'm losing so much of my time at work
to open an official bronystate D&P chatroom
TO create something that will allow me to lose time at work
and im running it
This isn't worth it
9yeah the colors are for mods rules only applies to our rooms
since im the DM
9that's Chang's room so yeah
i want people to see my text better and it being able to stand out
Dat overkill
and instead of pressing crtl K every single line
is there a way where i can set my text to a color
and all my lines will be that color
9OH MAI GAWD IT'S A PERFECT SOLDIA
No, I havent seen The Room. XD
so...any way to do that?
9is it just me
9or is Ypsilon like a scared kid in this game?

Pro Tip: Never fire a grenade rifle at point blank range in Fallout:New Vegas, you will get injured
But it's so much fun!
brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
Pro Tip: To kill a giant radscorpion, damage it until it dies
Pro Tip: Never fire the Fat Man at point blank range, either.
What if it doesn't die when it's killed?
Then you are fucked
Pro Tip: It may take 2 hits from a grenade rifle to kill a bighorner, but only one from your cyberdog companion's bite
At which hour does the stream start?
Pro Tip: The cop AI in Saints Row 2 is FUCKING INSANE!
No official stream today, so I dunno
On Saturday, you mean?
k how about for season 2?
yes saturday
I think it's 9AM eastern
The episode airs at 9 AM eastern.
9AM EST
2 PM GMT
what time is it now?
Turgle, actually it's 1 PM GMT.
i live in Europe =)
uhm
no
GMT cares not for daylight savings.
it's 2pm
OH!
3PM Central European Time
yes
im sorry you are right
wait, is he?
then it's 2PM CET I guess...
but according to ponycountdown it will be 2PM GMT
....no I'm pretty sure it's 2PM GMT
Pro Tip: If you lose sight of one of your companions that is a super mutant, you might be fucked

CET is EST+6
GMT is EST+5
It is currently 5:43 PM GMT

it is currently 6:43

i live in GMT+1
Yes, but we aren't /on/ EST. Us East Coast USA people are on Eastern /Daylight/ Time.
here is 7:43
uhm
i'm not getting it
EST: GMT -5.
EDT: GMT -4
Oh okay

lolwait, no...
Seriously, punch in "current time in New York" into Google
RP:
then punch in "current time in London
USA & Canada clocks are on Daylight Saving Time
its 1pm in NYC
Pinkie.
More like 1:45
Europe / UK clocks are on Summer Time
London isn't on GMT right now, it's on BST.
IE, GMT +1.
And Summer Time is the same as DST
FUCK YOU CONFUSING TIME ZONES!
lol okay
Different days they switch, though.
DecapKing: I blame Daylight Savings.
what a stupid international system to count time
What messes it up is the whole Daylight Savings nonsense.
we need STANDARDS
We /do/ have a standard. It's called GMT.
Greenwich Mean Time.
DST we should just follow arazonas example and say dont need it it's obsoleate.
So the show doesn't air at 9AM if you're in New York
Sumica: That's an awesome show.
well its harder here in the Midwest when you are a farmer
Pardon?
EspyLacopa, it was a sarcastic sentence
although im not
http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=179 <-- First result from googling "Current time in New York"
Well perhaps when farmers needed the extra Daylight hours
Hmmm. They're on EDT, ie GMT-4.
they do
Sumica: Farmers start their day with the sun rises.
cause they still bitch about it
Just read the Silent Ponyville... was not a good idea.
Daylight Savings was a wartime measure for factory workers and such.
it wasnt taht bad WhatPayne
Sad
so sad
Luckily multiple endings
the time on the clock has noting to do with when the sun comes up
So what states are on EST?
from MI east
right now?
Right now, yes
which states are not on EDT
I don't know any US states that ignore the whole daylight savings nonsense.
At least on the East Coast.
I give up on this conversation
all US states follow it
derp
/me now feels slightly down...
Incorect MrChang
That's kind of confusing then, to list times for EST, isn't it?
who doesn't?
montana?
Espy: Indiana used to
/me immediately hugs Pinkie-Pie
RobotPinkie: Indeed.
The only state that still ignores DST is Arizona
You talking about time zones?
And frankly, buck Arizona
Yes.. Hi MrChang
Hello Pinkie
Arizona and Hawaii as well as most US tertitories
i can't help it
she's my favority
I know, I know..
favorite
: D
:P
How did you notice me so fast though..?
Fav Rarity?
im on mIRC
sorry i have quick eyes
its a habit
thats why im a day trader :D
So when The Hub lists things as being at Eastern time, you're saying they mean EST?
yes
everybody loves EST
The Hub is likely referring to EDT right now, since it's a US network.
I think that's either completely wrong, or complete lunacy :P
list 4 times, one of which applies nowhere in the US
9hey guys
9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8TB7gX4f8
9SHINJI IKARI: FUCKING SAMURAI
I need a hug
And just where did he get a vibrosword.
/me hugs WhatPayne
/me hugs WhatPayne~
/me hugs back
Thank you
/me hugs WhatPayne
Well, it says 9AM eastern on The Hub site, so... I'm guessing that's not 9AM EST...
im not the hugging type of person
Im usually not either.
9Sumica, the series bible show he was planned to have it since day 1
9but it never made it into the actual show
It's okay to hug here
9but it's pretty much everpresent in the games
9also it actually IS a Vibrosword
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
If you are on the hub site it shows your local times IIRC or you can at least set it to your local time.
I GOT KILLED BY A CAZADOR!
so i just woke up, right? and i was like
which still means 2PM in London and 3PM in central Europe
trying to put pants on, right?
and i like
almost fell over
one leg at a time ctrlx
So yeah, good to know.
anyways, you guys think that since there was a winter wrap up in s1 that there'll be a winter..unwrapping?
for the record on DST and such most dont take intoaccount things like EST and EDT
damn
died again
fucking cazadors
So 3 days left
i'm pretty damnn excited
Hm RobotPinkie?
SO excited.
Me too, especially since I listened to the Thiessen interview
fqf
Guys?
Guuuys?
He's really good at getting bronies pumped
man i forgot to listen to that before i went to bed
hay AllisZero
Sup AllisZero
So when is the actual airing of season 2?
Oh go download it and listen, it's awesome :O
9:00 EDT.... I'm guessing
EDT?
it's the same as est
Eastern Daylight Time, which is the EST time zone
thiessen interview? :O
didn't know about that
omg i put a shirt on all by myself!
i'm a big boy!
Hahaha I'm tetherd through my phone, into my VPN at home
thethering <3
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/exclusive-season-2-audio-interview-with.html
Go listen NAO
EST=GMT-5?
Looks like my problem here really is on my side of the network, not at home
It's not spoilerific at all, but has a lot of good info on the show
season 2 is going to be like the winter wrapup of my soul
9-4 I Think
:O
and TONS of brony love
AllisZero, probably. i know with att they like to filter some ports
No, EST is GMT-5
Ah thanks DCD
Wait what?
Check it on google. "current time in new york" and "current time in london"
AllisZero, any encryption has always given me troubles
Yes, EST is GMT-5.
GUYS I CAN'T FIND ANY SOCKS
wow
you people really care about your time
New York however is currently on EDT, and thus GMT-4.
In most states in the USA and in most provinces in Canada, Daylight-Saving Time (DST) is observed. During DST the time is shifted forward by 1 hour to EDT; which is 4 hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT-4).
After the Summer months Eastern Time is shifted back by 1 hour to US Eastern Standard Time (EST) or (GMT-5).
This confuses me
Yes, EspyLacopa, but London is also one hour off...
I have a dedicated 10 meg fiber pipe at work, they shouldn't block any ports
So it's my firewall really
Because right now London is on BST (British Summer Time)
Seriously Pinkie, stop and actually read the info the page is saying.
thanks RP
No, Espy, when people say "I'm at GMT," they mean they're in London
Then they're wrong.
right now London isn't on GMT.
GMT never changes due to seasons.
The time in London does.
guys i am all dressed and ready for work! :D
:D i really don't wanna go
we dont want you to go either ctrlx, If you have a hard time geting dressed i dont want to think about you driveing.
^
lol
oh don't worry. my license is suspended
._.
OH WELL
i get it back the 28th though
Well I stay here through the whole day and spy for the airing to start anywho so it does not matter
everybody loves bikes
Turgle, 5 miles out of town and its raining ;P
everybody loves bikes
.
mine is broken
:s
D:
i didn't love it enough
i fed it
and watered it
but just didn't love it enough ;-;
/me off to brush teeth and whatnot then wait for ride to come
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_Savings <-- Look at the map to see how much of the world observes Daylight Savings
40%
Trust me, I know, we observe it here as well.
Stream's up.
Ok now I'm starting to feel a bit better...
Armor Games..
gahahahahahahaaaa
/me waves to all in chat
Holy shit!

I don't know why that fanfic made me so depressed...
You're just a sack of old sacks.
Oh we get to hear Dari speek again.
ohay Silvermane

http://bronystate.net/theatre/
Dinkypage isn't working I don't think.
Not sure if the stream embed isn't updated or something.
So looks like dari is reading fics on DA
ahh, alrighty. i'll be sure to visit that later, as this computer over heats and dies wheneveri turn on the stream
HE WHAT
oh its the fic i linked
Dari, you should get hints from DCD on how to improve the stream quality.
His brai is stuck in a wth loop.
I know that game
prince dari has a mad. perhaps some durrrgaaarrr would help >.>
What's with all the other green areas?
the green areas are safe/checkpoints
Dumb game

so espy
im not going to rely heavily on stats
but its no problem if you do your stats
mighty big if... >.> <3
I thought you said it was easy
lets play a drinking game, every time dari says damnit.
damnit
i'm drunk
I once tried this game and it destroyed me
So, what's the easy way to do this level?
I hate this game sooo much.
goodnight all
Dat sound effect
...um night
Goodnight?
good day sir!
Dari gonna die
europonies
hurray for the 5-6 hr time diff
Daym Dari you has some skill

i got permission to open up an official bronystate D&P room
who's interested?
we've already 5 adventurers!
Dance with the blue dots!
Brushie brushie level.
PM me if you're interested
Dari u mad?
Lulz
OMFG OMFG OMFG Someone wrote a fanfic to explain why Caramel became a filly... AND MY EYES
Not the dots oh god the dot, they are in my eyes.
6Did I just see you post about caramel?
6inb4 Val shows up D:
yes you did
2,14 ...................................
oh god, you're right
Its supposed to get harder
Lol
2,14 well I clearly have wonderful timing
Yousa gonna die
this story explains why caramel became a filly
Dari u mad?
6HURRY VAL! THE TRIDENT! ;D
2,14 why oh why do I have to be RESPONSIBLE with my mod powers?
i didn't write it, i just read it today
Heh
didnt we stop val from using his tridnt?
it was on EQD
40 million EqD coming soon
The commentary makes it 20% cooler.
So what or who did Val's fave pony get shipped with this time?
Sumica, Applejack
Valthejean: because with great powers comes great responsibilities.
Check your PMs CrystalClear
You got it Dari
its close but no cigar Dari
6Dari the red box has been destroyed D;
Also close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.
so, Caramel is tired of Applejack rejecting his advances
There's a joke in here somewhere about blue balls
i chose not to make it
2,14 okay I really don't need you to describe it to me
2,14 at all
you should anyways
awww, okay val :( but I luvs you <3
That game is scarier than Dead Island
Or Silent Hill even
you called dead island scary?
yfw
6Box Dari is best Dari
Not sure if I would call it scary. Kinda nerve wracking
get a whore
lol
here's the part where he kills you
Feeling a bit tipsy Sumica?
Lol
then insta killed
called it
Purple dots are best dots.
Must be from all the red they got.
Oh, dari is being a hardcore gam0rz?
Waiting for todays S2 screenshot
Turn your head and cough.
After seeing yesterdays.. Im kinda scared
XD
i love how i learned to change my nick
How do you like, THEM apples?
I've always wanted to see a "no upgrade run"
Big mac line here.
2,14 dari should get WC3 and stream us playing it :P
Now THAT I could get behind, Val
6:33
ew
Warcraft III
wc3?
ohay VioletVanilla :3
not WoW
WoW is an abomination
Warcraft III is a strategy game
half wrong
WoW murdered everything that was good about Warcraft
literally
it killed off all the good characters
WoW and WC are extremely different
Right, hola Violet.... Saw you hugging me earlier.
Warcraft III: Real Time Strategy Game
Val is just mad he cant have a LKxCaramel fix now.
Yet again, I'm without hugs :(
WoW: MMORPG that /eats your soul!!!/
I'm writing a Sea Ponies x Caramel Apple clopfic, currently
2,14 the stream seems to lag a lot for me, is anyone else getting that?
shoo be doo?
RobotPinkie, fund it
(that's a lie,btw)
Same here
Probably internet.
>_>
07yep
ohay Luna :O
Virgin is pretty skittish.

6Dari died. . . x.x
Stream should be back up now.
:(
Oh lol, I thought you did a ragequit for a sec there
2,14 inb4 he dies
Have faith in your superiors Valthejean
Or Val the Arch Demon, if you would.
Believe int he Pinkie that believes in you!
I am sometimes seriously tempted to write a bad clopfic about sea ponies, though...
2,14 I have faith in no one other than myself
2,14 and woona
Work dem balls
and ded
RobotPinkie, im trying to talk to you.
oh lol, sorry
cause its pie
thats why Dari
2,14 because one bite and it's wet ;)
Because pie is delicious.
why not get the top right first
2,14 dari....lie? NONSENSE
Dari kinda reminds me of Cave Johnson when he's mad.
Inconceivable!
Ohey `Fluttershy is here too
going down the swear list Dari?
Now dari is listing the words you cant say on tv.
2,14 aaaaaaaand we get a C&D from Dari's swearing :P
Hey everypony
Lol, impossible game :P good luck dari
Oh man, that was so close
Still say get the top right one first
wankstand?
200 deaths inbound!
*twap twap twap*
HNNNG, anyone know a good way of combatting a depression before S2?
watch another great series
like doctor who or dexter
Read Fanfiction
Thats what im doing
^ or that
I really should finish watching Patlabor and Planetes.
and it's onl lv 21
VioletVanilla, you are more than welcome to stay, and i apprecaite that you were looing out for us
Convince streamers to do LPs? Like Dari is doing right now?
Hmm, I haven't finished catching up on Doctor Who yet
Good idea, thanks KanyeEast
which doctor are you on?
Hey RobotPinks, checked the Firefly yet?
you could watch some old who too
like baker's run
hey guys quick question
Oh that's right, Firefly!
fancy a jelly baby?
...only I don't have HD space for it right now... crap
Baker's win is partly because of Douglass Adams doing some of the writing.
luck
MLP:FiM season 2 is gunna be streamed here live?
I love Tom Baker
2,14 eeyup thing
of course it is
I don't want to wait a few days before I can watch it
including the whole season 1 run up all night long
Buy one of those terabytes
/me glomps VioletVanilla. "No need to leave us, it's okay. We just usually expect worse than that image >.> "
but yeah, Douglas Adams did some very good writing for his Doctor
How dose every one keep finding this out?!
i like what moffat is doing with matt smith
awesome, screw you England and your stupid failure
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIdDXQ2h1Pc <-- Have some Baker singing.
we've only got the first half of season 1!
moffat writes some scary stuff
and he one shots it
i loved the doctors wife though
haha, that's hilarious, EspyLacopa
It goes both ways..?
Gilbert and Sullivan + Doctor Who, oh wow...
this is amazing
you still died Dari
lol he took the death on next level
Thing there will be a marathon of s1 before s2 her as well.
here*
i have a feeling the time lords will come back with the next doctor's regeneration
That was just... wow
down right pro
and noob death
Hey guys I have question to everyone regarding stereotypes which interest me...
Sumica That's cool, will the episodes be as jerky as this?
keeps stopping and starting slightly
Okay, WhatPayne
Shoot
No this is just dariplaying around he's not streaming the eps.
same for me and nah, its a lot smoother
awesome
Hi Octavia
6Octavia!! :3
and called it four loko
13Hey
Something which we call being "Jonne"
yeah was gonna say that Kabaka
er KanyeEast
2,14 ohai tavi
Sumica: oh hi
ohay Octavia
And I wonder if you have these hyper active kids drinking energy drinks like water?
As a college person I can only speculate on littler kids but here at uni many people do drink energy drinks
/me waves at the arriving people
nos>monster>anything else
It's not just drinking per say (I mean I drink energy drinks)
but not like water, they really dehydrate you and I can only drink one at day or so
MFW I've already passed the level.
But stream is so laggy. XD
God dammit Virgin.
Wow, that must make me really weird what with only drinking water.
Any House MD tonight, Luna?
Must be like 5 min of lag then
But it's this parents say "energy drinks are bad and should be banned from under 15 year old"
yeah well they ARE bad for you
And the kids do exact opposite
I'll put quality at lowest because Vrigin hates me. >_>
wat, Virgin is playing tricks on you? I thought they were a good ISP
Energy Drinks are for upper end athletes aren't they?
or for people who have late night papers to write
nope
Like kids normally do... But as a side effect the alcohol drinking amongst young teens has dropped
Virgin's internet is usually pretty good but the speed sometimes derps massively.
Replaced by energy drinks...
red hot chilli peppers + can of monster = paper gets done
And yeah, WhatPayne, Sweden adopted a law forbidding the sale of energy drinks to people under 18
It was apparently that bad
if thats true though, then I think thats a good thing. Energy drinks are less worse for you than alcohol
So, valthejean, what did you think of the interview? What did you think about the teases he did?
the interview was amazing
nice to see they actually care about what they do
heheheheeh
streemception time.
Oh you finished listening to the Thiessen interview?
awesome
It likely helps that energy drinks don't require an ID to buy.
"We've got bronies in the studio"
KanyeEast Ttue
ok so bronystate.com or whatever is teh place where they're streamin the episodes?
*true
That interview seriously made me giddy inside
apparently they all pass around fanfics and art to each other that they like
Bronystate.net, CAJ
well yeah that's what i meant
KanyeEast, it seemed to be more implied to be fanart and PMVs rather than Fanfics. Due to the content.
thats true, all sorts of legal snaggles if they started using anything like ideas
exactly.
Yeah I think fanfics are barred on the FiM team
Hold on I'll try to find picture which perfectly embodies what I'm talking about
so sadly luna will probably not have an abacus
Yeah. Because that could bring all of the Intellectual Property stuff on the board. Meaning Shit hitting the fan usually.
and I love that Thiessen loves the image memes
/me glomps Octavia. "Hello most beautiful of 6-best ponies"
Luna?
Will there be House MD today?
/me waves at NewDCD
Hey Octavia
you know, i've always wondered what it would be like if hugh laurie became the next doctor
6They are, Rainbow Dash.
LAWL
Just think Dari, in a few hours the sun will rise.
13lol Hey Silvermane and DecapKing :P
That would be pretty funny, if nothing else, KanyeEast
/me glomps Octavia
EspyLacopa, what in the fuck does that even mean? Huh?
/me 13is dead exhausted
^_^
/me hugs octavia
Though I think canonically the Doctor keeps getting younger with each incarnation
(lol ILU YGO:TAS)
/me gives Octavia caffeine
thats true, pretty soon he'll be justin bieber
inb4 teenage angsty Doctor
/me hugs hekeshi
13Hehe <3
lolol
2,14 there is only one person I consider worse than Justin Bieber
Robert Pattinson as next Doctor PLZ
2,14 but I am waiting for the right time to introduce him to you all :P
is he ginger?
/me gives Octavia chocolate~
13Justin Bieber, ewwww
ZUN made it?
/me 13cant have chocolate :(
luckily robert pattinson isn't british
so he can't be the doctor
He can do a fake British accent that will make everyone cringe, I'm sure
as can I, btw
I should be the next Doctor
daniel radcliff as next doctor
He's too famous and expensive
and too harry potter
Yeah...
the 12th doctor will probably have red hair
all the "i want to be ginger" comments
Oh wow
REGISTER
6Sorry Dari D;
Tim Minchin should be the next Doctor http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVN_0qvuhhw
SERIOUSLY
just watch that, and tell me he shouldn't be the Doctor :P
Tim Currey as the 12th Doctor?
I can see it pinkie
2,14 Espy: FUND IT
Hehe, i know that problem
I <3 Tim Minchin
Alan Rickman for doctor
He's even properly british.
yay im registered on here now
just set your status to occupied, problem solved
Yeah Tim Minchin is from Oz
unfortunately
suspense!
he's got the crazy eyes going too
bets he's gunna screw up?
Watch, Dari'll get killed by the purple ball right before getting back to the goal.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8Ej9-q0dqU&feature=related
6DARI WIN!!! :DD
EPIC WIN
Die, alot
It says SOS! Shoo be doo!
yep
Yes Dari Call apon the Seaponies
Hey, is anyone here doing that PRG thing at 4:00?
The one that Chang is holding?
Yeah
PRG?
Ok I found image which embodies the kids+energy drinks
sadly I have a history paper to work on at my library so you won't get any Samule Jackson
http://de.acidcow.com/pics/20091026/acid_picdump_71_02.jpg
Yeah i have to go somewhere and wont be back till this evening. tell him that PunchBolt won't be able to make it
I'm sorry
lawl WhatPayne
alright?
Those are girls (I suppose) but it's more regular amongst boys
So yeah, it has become a joke here
You totally will.
Hi Ghosties
Hey
is someone gonna tell that guy that punchbolt wont be able to make it? even though hell notice when im not there
I don't think anyone else from D&P is here yet
well youre from it right?
or no?
The Janitor is here.
Well, shit
yeah, but I won't make it
It's a NAT problem with my firewall
alright someone put in a word for both of us. i gotta leave in like 10 minutes or less
tell em ill be back this evening maybe around 6 or so
i gotta go, bye
night LordCelestia
RobotPinkie how's the energy drinks + kids in Sweden?
so they actually banned energy drinks in sweden? thats pretty hardcore
cya
people got pissed about the four loko thing in the U.S. and it was killing people
Well they have only stopped stores from selling them to kids, KanyeEast
I can still drink them :P
I believe they has not been banned per say. But the cashiers have been instructed not to sell them to kids under 15 here
ah, i've seen a few shops that didn't let kids buy them
Oh no, Dari, you'll have to do *6* times
kids under 15 really have no reason to drink energy drinks anyway
Here I believe it's illegal for stores to sell them to kids under 18
KanyeEast Where do you live?
same treatment as cigarettes
Now do it again
North Carolina, its mostly been at summer camps and places with lots of kids
Only now he can't hug the walls while doing so.
Can I get a hug instead of the walls? I'm jelly
I believe the "ban" here has only encouraged kids to acquire them
/me hugs RobotPinkie
did anyone see the mlp review that went up on thatguywiththeglasses?
/me hugs RobotPinkie
/me hugs back. "Thanks guys"
Oh, cool, KanyeEast lives in NC
What goes around comes around. Even hugs
/me hugs RobotPinkie~
ohay Ghosties
it was that one right there.
yup, i'm only here for college though
*waves*
/me hugs VioletVanilla back :3
6THE BALLS ARE INERT DARI!
so I know nothing about this state besides thinking all the accents are funny
lol VV
KanyeEast: So it's like a thing where some kid always sneaks energy drinks to camp area?
XD Ghosties
You do it. :P
There's MLP review in TGWTG?
nah, all I saw was signs up that said "kids from x camp can't buy energy drinks"
http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/cr/ff/32418-episode-57-my-little-pony-retrospective-part-1
I don't wanna do it. I'm busy playing Deus Ex Human Revolution
CR apparently is a hardcore brony
even watching it in the 1980's when it wasn't cool
http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/blogs/latest/entry/dsott-3-my-little-pony-fim
oh wow Dari is on level 28
That MLP is pre G4?
i think that looks like 3.5
I think he'll do a "why fim is awesome" part 2 later in the week
Never mind, Just watching it
but he does a lead up to it
whose the villian in the mlp movie we're watching on friday?
He just said he's doing that in the beginning of the video
THE SMOOZE!
A shoggoth.
oh god, and I sort of wanted to see tirac
but shoggoths are cool too
You know Nostalgia Chick did MLP review before FIM came out. It's pretty good.
Watching the MLP review, lol
^
I never realized how awful 3.0 and 3.5 were
ahhh kayne
why aren't you coming?
got a meeting with a project group in the library in about half an hour
bawww
bring your laptop there lol
Hey this review is pretty good
taking long to load :(
6You can do it Dari!!
I doubt they'll appreciate my reasoning of "i'm roleplaying a pony and fighting skelatons" as a excuse
/me cheers for Dari~
i planned a boss fight and everything
aw
maybe trm
/me giggles~
if there arent enough, we'll do it trm
6You will do it within 500!
You can go on without Samule Jackson, i'm sure.
lol @ Katrina
i dont want to spoil it
@Violet: No, he won't
but the boss fight is going to be demonic
650!
6 502!
demonic ponies? oh dear
yep
6 503!
a big big burly demon pony
6 504?

My latest e-mail from ThinkGeek is titled "ThinkGeek launches 32 items (but not to the moon)‏"

Someone here should air this review
I mean stream
No, /this/ is joking...
Indeed WhatPayne
If you know who Jonathan Ross is, watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt-lotqZQsc
How many half-elves does it take to screw in a light bulb?
But then Dari would learn of that clip.
/me cutting up ze onion and celerry for tasty meatloaf
/me just watched Totalbiscuit's WTF is Space Marine Multiplayer
6Somepony should send this to Retsuprae~
Huh, he made it
o.o
o.o
2,14 I believe dari's sound is gone
I am sure you will find it and show it all the time once you do Dari.
Why?
If this room had a swear jar... :P
I'd like to put a swear into the swear jar.
ASS!
Like it's been doing the whole time? XD
Oh, my, god... New Born Ponies
Wee, cutting up onions.
You need training from Piccolo if you want to get better at dodging things
DODGE
DOOOOOOODGE!
Oh god i just got to that part WhatPayne
How many namekians does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
and it's the thing they tortured us with on friday.
None, because they're all dead.
...Regardless, that was really good review
Freiza is my favorite part of the second season of dbz abridged
6I think I hear the gears in Dari's head grinding. . . o.o
Oh Littlekuriboh voices Frieza in DBZ abridged
Oh god he listed the clips in the credits. We are doomed.
mainly because of how evil little kuriboh is at being a villian
Jesus fuck, I just got out of a Skype conversation with a guy who claimed that he knows a writer for Season 2 and they said they're getting rid of a minor character permanently
What an idiot
or he's trolling you
when in doubt, Yes Flutteryay
or they'll do a very special episode where someone gets cancer
He implied it would be Derpy or Luna
lol
bs
Burn him by the stake.
come to me, delicious ground beef. . .
He also said that he thinks Season 2 will be bad.
luna would have to be in more episodes to count as a 'minor character'
Blasphemer
What. I call bs. Derpy and Luna are the top two fan favorite minor characters
2 lines and 30 seconds of screen time do not a minor character make
But we know both Luna and Derpy will come back
Wait he said background character
but still I call BS
^
I asked him who the writer was and he said he couldn't remember his name
lol
6This MUSIC is killing me . .. x.x
jeas if you are gonna make up a story at least take a moment to reply while you google a writer name.
And hasn't that rumor been around since the announcement of season 2 that some character will be gotten rid of.
Dari, just give it up
You're not gonna win
715,716,717,718,719
I for one will not believe it until I se it or it comes straight from the horse's mouth
If you can win before a 1,000 deaths, I'll be impressed
In mean while.... There's that Nostalgia Chick's review of MLP

Hey Ziltoid
We're not pastries tho
after seeing this review, I am glad I am working friday night.
Which review?
Why is dari still playing this game
13Dont be such a prude Pinkie Pie!
Nolstlgachick.
Watching you die over and over reminds me of Oddworld. Except Oddworld has mildly amusing dialogue.
Right... Why is that Sumica?
the b movie on friday. is the MLP movie
Why is audio borked
Oh, oh, ohh....
Dammit
Where the hell is the question mark on this damn keyboard
13I usedto love that movie when I was little
http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/team-nchick/nostalgia-chick/17773-my-little-pony
But the nchick review was pretty good too.
^^ that one
I'm hoping Nostalgia Chick does a review of FiM eventually
the review was fin I just dont think I could stand the movie.
Same here
or well, I'd like to see one from Nostalgia Critic too
but that's not gonna happen
what?
did the dude just go crazy?
13As far as the old gens of MLP go, the MLP Movie wasn't too bad overall.
I don't know. FIM is something completely different from what we have seen before
6Oh you will all see the MLP movie this Friday ;D
/me 13has already seen it a million times lol
Nothing with Tony Randall could possibly be very bad, Octavia
13The liked the witch sisters in it, they were really the main characters over the ponies.
He's like... my hero
I get the impression that in the old show none of the ponies had personalities
13Not really.
Is it just me or does people not belong to MLP?
Hello Bronystate!
13By todays standards, they were rather bland.
hiya
That's a lot of OP's
She brought up a good point thought, Who was the protagnist?
If you haven't, watch this movie... then realize that he's Moochick http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057812/
Who was the phone?
13Yeah, starting to get a lot of new mods. lol

Dear princess celstia, today i learned that purple balls are deadly.

Glasses are witchcraft

13Also, Dari is never going to beat this level. Evar. lol

*twap*
Btw. Will Violet at some point turn up in the "About Us" page?
13I think of your ass as a new mod

dat flank
904? my stream was behind
Twilight blushed a bright crimson, revving up her motors to attempt to outpace Trixieberg. It was no use. "Leave my aft out of this!" she protested.
Trixieberg just laughed as she banked sharply to push Twilight out the way, knocking the little blimp into a spin. "Come on Twilight!" she mocked. "Trixieberg waits for no blimp!"
becaus he's been at it for hours and only got 2 levels left?
lol silvermane
wrong channel?
by the time he beats this, he will be god of gaming
Is this the first game or the second?
Because I think there's two

LMAO
Holy--
haha
What.
riiiiiight....
dat pattern...
Tip: The following level is impossible :P
XD
inb4 >100 deaths
Beware, beware.
lol
Ninja cube
Hiding
they have a set path
i bet this level really IS impossible
but each of them has a different pattern
and you have to get back to the start.
the middle one goes back and forth, the other four circle around it seems
is it possible to enter the same green area where you start to finish the level?
Two of them are going around the outside, two are going around the inside, and one's going back and forth around the middle
2 on the out two mid and one center
Dari is flipping his shit
Tripping so hard
Very carefully.
turn on your ninja cube skills, dari
and after this he dose it again on normal diffaculty.
theres so many times when playing this game that you wish the cube moved faster
Am I seeing right or is there a small spot where the five cubes does not hit? On the right side of where the middle one stops
and some times when it moves too fast
dose look that way WhatPayne
Slow ones hit that spot
Yeah
ninja slow balls
What's this game called again? I forget
You cant win i think
it says in the corner
Thunder_Dash The impossible game I think
Err.. No "I think"
Wait there is similar spot on the left side too
speaking of impossible game, anyone remember that web browser thing notpron?
I think...
where is dari from/
Red balls, it gives you death
Wait.. Thats not the impossible game.. Thats a quiz
ah, found it - The World's Hardest Game
Oops

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhl9pJB-2Ak Battletoads
oh god battle toads.
you're about to see.
SO MUCH WORSE.
The one on EqD is really laggy though, derpyhooves.com is fine
Everything kills you.
Everything.
the very level itself hates you
Saying that IWBTG is hard is like saying that getting hit by a train is slightly painful
In other words: It's a shit game :P
What Thunder said
it looks like an trial and error platformer where you can only progress by dying to everything
pretty much, yeah
dude
i hate that guy at right
And then after you die to everything, you still need perfect timing to dodge it.
Turgle
We're Always Watching
WTF
He's always watching
That guy at the right reminds me of something.........

Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of SOON
Also I'm not RPing right now so

Yes
naaah

/me has kept away from the spoilers
Any link to EqD will result in immediate and permanent ban
hello?
hello?
Spoilery spoilers.
I'm bouncing in anticipation of Dari's IWBTG play.
hello?
I'm just giggling like a loon hero
I dont know of any spoilers in it as i have not heard it. But every one keeps spouting it has "spoilers" in it.
The farthest I've ever gotten was the 5th screen I believe
Are we supposed to listen something?
Seems pretty accurate.
What does? It didn't appear for me
well, that clip wasnt SOOO spoilerific... for one who saw the last clip
@Pantsmeter
Plus install time.
Sing us a song while you install
no installation
in stool?
Also dat MM2 music
We can't see the bottom btw.
might want to reset stream feed
Rampage
Yeah, we're missing pieces of the screen.
i see the right blue line
This game is about 90% old school video game references
well, good luck.
LOL
Haha, oh wow.
Oh wow
FUUUUUUUUUUUU
hard game
Take your reprieve and thank god for his mercy
now RUN AWAY
trolling game is trolling
> implying you can win IWBTG in the first place
You failed the first level Dari
Try again :0
The only winning move is not to play!
DAT GUY
WTF
>implying that isn't a win
It's.... not supposed to do that
man
The only way to win is not to play.
he's horrible
maybe try a compatibility mode if it keeps crashing?
You'll see a lot of the splatter.
:0
6Is Dari really playing this game?
I didn't know that, so cool.
yep
Yarp
yarrr
Nice Rampage reffrence.
I think you can skip the intro :0
YOU ARE PLAYING WHAT!?!?
Shift, arrows, and Z iirc
YUP
oh dear god
HARD
wait, you are allowed to save this game?
THE HARDEST
yep
Medium
Medium <3
MEDIUM.
Impossible!!
yeah, shift is jump, Z is shoot
yessss
NO
9>Dari playing IWBTG
haahaha
9this can't end well
9also
9DARI
9Y U NO FIX INPUT RESOLUTION?
TEN SECONDS FLAT
XD
Enjoy.
9THE ARTIFACTS ARE HORRENDOUS
hah
lol
DCD, my internet is derping.
Impossible = no save points
Impossible has no save points.
because impossible
wow well done
So I'm streaming on lowest possible quality.
XP
No saving in impossible
there's a reason we advised medium
Play Medium then
fastist death ever
No saving in impossible
So no continuing in impossible
LOL
Go up
you can double-jump by hitting shift twice, too
Go up I suggest
'Cause impossible has no saving
at all
EUREKA
cause it's imposable
MOTHERFUCKA
XD
6Dari, follow the spike as it retracts. . .
I hear some people did manage to beat impossible. Impossibly.
I lol'd
any one seeing a pattern yet?
Go up :0
It splats him in the face the second he lowers his guard
love it XD
AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA
Hah, I forgot about that
Go left?

GOOOO UUUUUP
Yes.
Yes
dammit

UUUUUP
The game is beatable.
I swear.

Probably not.
No
AHAHAHAHHAHAHA
XD
HAHAHAHA
hahah
Hahaha.
looool
No.
WAT
Go up
I... don't remember what to do next
it's probably a drill
And that is why you go up.
Go left and UP
Find the secret passage.
Dari playing IWBTG XD
APPLES.
NEWTON WAS RIGHT!
APPLEJACK!!!
death by apple
haha
Hahaha.
lol Applejakc is evil
dari is an expert applebucker
Yup.
I can't see the bottom of the screen :0
Heatseaking apples
XDD
ROFL
You weren't far enough to the right
Because the game hates you.
Fix the game resolution?
muuuch better
there we go
There we go. :D
lol, that helps
lol
and gib
You can see yourself die!
> mfw "Now I can see!" *walks forward, hit by apple*
now we can see the entirety of your demises :P
It gets worse, I assure you
XDDD
hahahahahha
lol
Hey, I'm back with more Questions... Sorry.
dari <3
Lol
Well, I'm off for the night.
Night night everypony
So we've made it to screen two
bye RobotPinkie :)
See ya, RobotPinkie
Goodnight RobotPinkie
progress is above expected levels
Anyway, while it's streaming, will S2E1 be recorded, in case there's a delay?
Hatred is the natural emotion for someone playing IWBTG
You are on screen 2 of about 70
If you want to really feel despair, go find a map of the game
Not to mention the bosses
I never even made it to a boss :0
:P
I forget, can gravity kill you in this game?
Hello...?
but wait, it gets better :3
Apparently not randomgut
That's ok, he hasn't reached the part where the MOON falls on him yet.
guy*
HAHAHA|
Will you or will you not be recording the stream?
AHAHAHAHHAHA
"Clouds can't kill you".
stupid clouds
Yes, you shoot bosses.
the save blocks... well, save the game when you shoot them
OH MY GOD, THIS ROOM.
Save point over there.
RyanRodriguez I belive it will be recorrded. keep in mind the eps is rebrodcast again right after.
DOuble jump and shoot
hit the save point
go man
shoot the yellow thing when you get near.
Thanks, Sumica!
They don't disappear.
don't do it :C
Stupid wall
Oh, you can't :v
I was not aware of there being any intentions of immediate re-broadcasting.
kick those apples!
You should have done easy mode. Save points on every screen.
This is what happens if you don't applebuck regularly...
Of course, it also makes you wear a pink bow, but...
check the HUB's gude at http://www.hubworld.com/tv-schedule
ep 201 is being shown twice in a row.
Alright. Thanks again, Sumica!
Famous last words.
Dari > Apples
lawl
Nope. No joking here
XD
ahahaha
hehehehe
Trololololol
easy mode it XDD
ahahahahha
do it in easy mode, dari!
mwahahha.
DON't easymode
IIRC, you have to jump on it, quickly run off the right side, and use your air-jump to get to the bottom left one
and now you know why the drills are moving
Cheerio!
*Jedi* You ~want~ the save points
Why not easy mode?
Is there something I don't know, Derm?
If it's worth doing, it's worth doing it HARDCORE!
because of easy
apparently they like rage?
Easymode puts additional save blocks. Sometimes you can save and get stuck in an endless loop.
it's amazing this kid made it to the age of 15
xD
you can turn that off, you know.
2,14 lol you still playing games dari? :P
You can change the controls
IWBTG?! How much have I missed?
You can turn sticky keys off
The bottom-left one?
Not much Extra
You have to jump off the cloud going up and double jump
jump on the lifting one, then jump right back down before you hit the spikes
Double jump!
then double jump
Purple Prose knows too
yes it is
you jump to the right
Walk off the edge of the lifting one.
It's possible, just... annoying
jump on the very edge, then run off
yay
and you made it so farr...oh wait.
Dari, this is easy peasy in comparison to the latter stages
FFFUUUUUUUhhhh
No.
Nyope.
Stupid fabric
Ctrl + Alt + Del
This game hates you.
Dumb game
task manager and force dat shit to end
Don't worry. IWBtG hates you too.
kill it with fire
Dari, you have any console games that would be fun to watch you play?
2,14 dari should get WC3 :P
Why not play "Reimagine :The Game"?
Do you have Minecraft?
There's that FIM reference
2,14 lol...minecraft is NOT fun to watch :P
MINECRAFT
Beware the enderman.
inb4 Enderman/Weeping Angels jokes?
Fair enough.
valthejean, it is when you are a fan. You can get ideas for new structures and the like
ok
2,14 yeah, I'd rather just see the finished product
OR, they make a series like the yogscast where its all adventure.
2,14 since watching a guy whack a brick for 4 hours isn't fun to me
we're sill all watching
if any of you seen it before
alright lets do dis again, easy mode nao XD
another fun part of minecraft, val, is that you see how the guy builds the stuff, what tricks he uses to speed up production, etc
save points, save points everywhere
Who's saying MineCraft's not fun to watch? D:
I like watching minecraft...
2,14 that would be me
Valthejean
Dari, play Terraria
Reimagine :The Game: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/569281
XD
its better to play
And I don't even play it
Terraria. Meh.
i didnt mean for the streamer to look at it haha
Eh... I don't like Terraria
2,14 sorry, I already spend rediculous amounts of time playing games/posting ponies. I don't need to WATCH someone waste time on minecraft
Terraria's fun
It's more action/rpg with some creative elements.
i just meant anyone here who read the story to look at it
I watched a series called Super Minecraft. It was full of lulz.
whos streaming??
THAT EYE
Play Story of the Blanks
THAT NOSE
DDDDEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
kill him with fire
or her
or whatever
Well I tried
oh look
im the guy whose page u werejust on
moar spoilers
I wish SotB wasn't so short :0
What hero said
2,14 oh is this that stupid "creepy" applebloom game?
uuuuuh
Valthejean, is there anything you dont hate?
friendship is 8-bit
Val, you hate everything.
:p
2,14 plenty of things
Most things
2,14 just my taste is far too refined for your dulled senses
PRESS SPACE
Caramel and being a mod, right?
PRESS C
Lol
Val is Prince Blueblood!
shit i gotta go and i wont be able to see this
This is a great game
alright cya
Already saw DCD play this if I remember correctly
Val hates everything without Caremel
2,14 well Dari, since you never played it you can just go shut the fuck up
XDD
honestly, it may be short, but it's so dark and chilling, and the sequels promised are going to be great
hoity toity xD
hoity toity taste haha
XD
2,14 yes, I beat it
Planescape Torment?
2,14 because they are
2,14 Dari: prove me wrong
2,14 I dare you to
All rights reserved.
2,14 and I'll concede your point
Baldur's Gate is simply too accurate and true to the real V2 for me.
2,14 until then, you can go drink biscuits
^
2,14 yes, DRINK biscuits
I would like to point out that your opinion on how good a game is is just that, opinion.
Drink biscuits? 'Kay then
How does on drink biscuits
How
2,14 exactly
I think the argument goes that it's very accurate to tabletop mechanics?
i'm ok with that
2,14 it is because you're a retarded brit with no taste
2,14 that is why
rofl
Isnt Baldurs Gate really short? I havent played it in a long time
Brits = taste
2,14 baldur's gate is like...70 hours long...
2,14 doesn't mean you're right :P
a good RPG typically is very long
This is why I love the word "opinion"
>mfw nobody isa ctually right
2,14 yes it is :P
ladies, ladies, please, no fighting
2,14 tht's because my opinion actually matters dari :P
Plaaaayyyyy
....I dunno, Baldur's Gate got pretty good ratings on GF.
ignore him XD
ladies, ladies, please, space
2,14 nobody cares about some silly brit :P
let's just agree that the worst game ever is between the ET game and that one Aquaman game
around and around is where i see you going with this.
Silvermane; Action 52. That is all
Can we...
2,14 yeah, you completely misunderstood that metaphor
Can we make a different metaphor?
One without turds?
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_bKzxHRgRbOo/SfYx7kUQcZI/AAAAAAAABjE/Nk_WRXh5lHs/s320/turd+polish.jpg
can we stfu and play the game?
2,14 oh dari, u so troll. It's adorable
i vote on the game
2,14 inb4 OBTUSE
It's a shiny Atari 2600 E.T. cartridge?
>look at my green text
Who here's actually played ET!2600
2,14 lol

6Dari. . . . I love this so much. . .
Dari = the only true voice actor

This is pleading!
THIIIS IS WHIIIIIIIIINIIIIIIIIIIING

2,14 Ikr?
Thunder_Dash: I think I actually did once. . .I had /no/ idea how to play it.
It's all true

LOL.
Have you ever played this Dari? Or are you just messing around
I am easily amused

or are those decoration?
2,14 ZOMBIE GOASTS, LEAVE THIS PLACE
BUT THIS IS OUR HOUSE :'(
Darn.
/me vanishes for a while
WHY DOES ZECORA LIVE THERE IF ITS EVIL?!
Zecora just say gtfo, it's faster.
To be fair, this is about the kind of quality you could expect from NES games.
she's hardcore lol
may be the force be with you
MINDBUCK
THAT POINTER
^lol
Twilight tried to mess her up, then Zecora rolled with it
66Val. . . . . . I read Zombie Goasts as. . . .. . . .
2,14 as what?
oh boy
Zombie Goatse
6^ this c.c

Trees: Trololo

> "Stay right there"
> Game requires you not to
2,14 My Little Pony: Kids are fucking stupid
There should be an alternate ending. Just stand there for 15 minuets and you just go home. :3
BUT THIS IS OUR HOUSE :'(
2,14 and then he was sad because the zombie goasts couldn't live there anymore
VJ indeed
Welcome to sunny town...

whats the rom?
no$gba?
0You got it, dari?
6Dari. . .
6How many free Sims would you like? ;D
I've used VBA before. It was just fine.
A-whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
I've only used no$gba for multiplayer
/me 0owns a gamepad. Only for his emulators
9>no$gba
9>for GBA and not DS
razyn
9the open-source version of VBA is better
I have a urge to play gba games with my ps3 controller

/me loves how many fanfics have made reference to the Zombie Ponies from the Applebloom game
/me 0just realized he now has SRW.
2,14 hey DCD, is that HQ2x filter only available in no$gba?
0Excited
2,14 nm, found it
9naw, it's in VBA as well
9just make sure your scale matches your filter
9as in, if you're playing at 2X size, use HQ2X
9if you're playing 3X, use HQ3X
9and so on
9it makes the game look like sex
0^
9also Dari
9fix that fucking resolution before I go bananas
2,14 lol

9blow up the video to 2X size
dari, 2 questions
what does the 30 day evaluation mean?
It's just a guilt screen.
That answers that
;0
can i still use it after the 30 days?
9go to options again
You never actually have to buy it.
oh
It means after 30 days it takes longer to start up.
just like winrar :D
Really? Cool.

0Can we link the Bronystate underscore D&P channel? :P
9and then triangulate the coordinate of the top-leftmost part of the video
2,14 well I'm playing this game again, but this time I decided to be female for shits and giggles
2,14 turns out the story is totally different...

9you can rename your main, right?
2,14 SRW-J
ah
2,14 character? yeah
2,14 as well as the machine and ability names

i made one, i just want all the mods to approve just in case
2,14 well there will never be an "official" room because we wont be sponsoring it
0Oh NewDCD
9I don't think it really affects our ten-room limit
it shouldn't
2,14 but, so long as you do not break any of bronystate's rules, we'll look the other way
i run it
9so I think you can name it that if you want

9gimme a sec
Octo-Pie was first to the body. "Oh Rainbow Lobster!" she cried. "I'm sorry I didn't believe you, and now you are a delicious meal!" She sadly licked the tasty lobster's shell. "So succulently sad!"
....Silver you are cracked.
"Hush now!" Trix-Sea pushed her gills against Twillob's in a passionate kiss. Twilob would have blinked in shock but lobsters don't have any eyelids.
Bweeeeeeeeeeeeep
2,14 Silvermane, I don't know what you're talking about, but....no
6Natleyn~ :3

Holy shit
My video card is on FIIIRE
Get out the bacon and the eggs
Don't forget the pan. :3
How're you, Violet?
Ever since she was a little pencil sketch she had felt out of place, awkward in that massive space in which hung paintings of all shapes and sizes. She had been alone and lost in the crowd.
this guy is fucking off his rocker
first Twixie shipping as blimps
then twixie shipping as lobsters
and now, twixie shipping as Art. WTF dude
/end rant
<Grinch Voice> BRILLIANT!

CMC
Lawl Manticore
Spike, quit complaining and drive the super robot, for GREAT JUSTICE!
yeah he kind-of is a whining a-hole in the beginning, this guy.
Climb on in it's not like you have never drivven a giant robot before right?
>MFFW I accidentally the stream
It's okay Derma. -patpat-

9OPPAI MISSAIRU
^
hahahaha
indeed NewDCD
So this is that show I saw when i was a kid.
Wait a tick. Jovian Lizards? Those are the 'villains' of Nadesico, aren't they?
Spike, man up D:
Yes EspyLacopa
Yes EspyLacopa.
Ooooo, more SRT
....I'm sorry, I have to go laugh some more now.
SRW is a giant robot crossover of many shows.
AWWW YEAH

Dat chiptune
MANPOWER
O SLAVE
GO
fire the gems
Heh
Rarity stooooooooooorm!
2,14 this mecha uses the powers of his favorite unicorn
^ <3
no kill like overkill
yes, 5k damage.
DCD, you should have gone in and changed the weapon names too.
2,14 obviously Rarity has to work overtime to supply him with this many gems :P
9I can change them in the intermission
9so we'll do that post-stage
EspyLacopa: I'm sure he will at the intermission
Ah, fair enough
he confirmed it
9oh and I can change them for any unit
WE NEED SNAILS IN A MECH, DCD.
9APPLEBOUNCE
Looking forward to an awesome mech that NewDCD knows has a SHIT pilot.
PFfffffft haha
What would Snails' mech be? Ursa Minor?
Yes.
EspyLacopa: Snips
9obviously then Snails would be the Strike and the Freedom
boob bounces out of no where
9then again
9I DO like Snails
9but I don't like Jesus Yamato
o3o
Y U no finger crushers, NewDCD? That attack is so darn cool... Also, Ye need the Tempest Lancer
TEMPEST LANCER!!!! GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
And then Tempest Lancer
Gem Lance!
Fav attack for that mech
9oh God
Shatter and die!
o^oo
9Tempest Lancer: MANSPIKE ATTACK
I wub the Tempest Lancer.
indeed, NewDCD.
LVLUP
What was the show that the crew aboard the Nadesico loved watching?
Tempest Lancer is when Spike goes GAR enough to materialize his dreams
lawl Natleyn. TTGL is only in SRW-Z2
Awww :(
So GAR power wasn't introduced back then
I was 90% GAR yesterday
Gonna miss that.
9>GAR Power wasn't introduced back then
:3
lol
xD
/me hugs DCD
Who said I didn't say that on purpose...
xD
Bitch Slap attack?
Haha.
wat
FINGER CRUSHER
9wanted to watch all attacks
9so we could rename them
fingered it to death.
hehehehe
MECHABEASTS ARE HERE
KILL EM'
hehehehe
What series are the mechabeasts from?
I dun' know
9Mazinger
aaaaaaaaaah
guts...
yay
best healing power in the early stages
2,14 what does flying actually do for your mech?
9you ignore terrain
I'm guessing better move speed.
yeah
2,14 aahhhhh
9which might be disadvantegous or advantegeous
9god I just killed phonics
2,14 and I'm guessing that means you don't get the defense bonies as well?
wat
yes Val.
9it can be Disadvantageous or Advantageous
you get neither bonuses or penalties
9Forests, for example, grant def bonuses and evasion penalties
9and also make you move slower
I should watch more mecha anime. >_>;
indeed
some of them are flipping awesome.
Real Robot anime or Super Robot anime?
both have awesome shows
DCD should let me show Rebuild of eva.
Breast Missiles!
Breast! Missiles!
I'll watch some Nadeisco later.
in the Real Robot animes, I would recommend Dai-Guard.
9Sumica: >Implying I haven't planned streaming that.
=p
DCD, this is why I love you
I can't wait for the 3rd movie
:v
NewDCD knows how awesome Dai-Guard is, right?
9you all want to wreck this Mari
9http://blog-imgs-45-origin.fc2.com/m/e/l/meltyylove/Mari01.jpg
9and I don't blame you
So I imagine this game is pretty much the absolute dream of Mecha Anime fans
404 error NewDCD
Well ahve fun, gonna go play some Sins of a solar empire.
the entire series is herospirit.
Seeya later Sumica
Hiya herospirit
/me hugs herospirit
9also Val
/me hugs Nat
9flying consumes 5 En per turn
9all units regain 5 En every new Player Phase
9do the maht
ooh, didn't know that
2,14 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHH
El calor*something*
Makes sense.
2,14 no wonder lameass akito always ran out of EN!
Hahaha
hehehehe, makes sense yeah
Breast Missiles!
Geez, if I play this game, I'm going to end up with a dozen animes I need to watch.
El calor de neutra- acido es neutraliz- constante para-
I remade the stupid transparency cursor with a rainbow instead of steadily decreasing transparencies
hero: it's not a bad way to get into anime
Chemistry homework DCD?
NewDCD, that thing is about pH, that thing in spanish?
It's in spanish indeed
I got into 3-4 animes because of Jump Ultimate Stars.
(I dun' understand spanish, but I know french and they share the same latin root)
Natleyn, same here.
oh pH, that piece of shit of a design
...I lost my copy of it a couple years back though
/me brohoofs herospirit
60 bucks worth of import down the drain :p
/me brohoofs Nat
I still have Superstars lying around here, but my DS got lost during the first quarter of my freshman year. :C
Egh.
Junior.
2,14 out of curiosity
2,14 for mechs with multiple pilots
2,14 do the pilot's stats stack?
Why are mech animes always so ridiculously badass
because they're mech animes?
Oh god Boss
2,14 in other words, if I put one pilot with melee, and another with evade, would the bot get BOTH stat increases, or only from whoever is the main pilot?
dat map
2,14 yes no maybe so?
iOh Hi Octavia
13Hey
2,14 howdy octy
/me hugs Octavia
Hiya 'Tavi! <3
6Octy is back? :3 That was quick~
13Bleh,k friend turned my computer off the wrong way and royally messed it up.
Val, I have NO idea if they stack.
Hello again Vanilla.
2,14 do you know DCD?
NewDCD, Val has a very interesting question about pilot stats.
6Hallo Natleyn~ ;3
/me waves at Octavia and VioletVanilla
I wonder why the Lizards are working with the Mechabeasts.
;3
YAY INTERMISSION
9I think there's some stacking
/me waves back at Dermathil~
9but it's not exactly full-on stacking
9I don't really know the details
2,14 hmmmm...okay. Thanks DCD :P
thanks NewDCD
who said they are, EspyLacopa?
Were what?
Oh, the lizards and the beasts.
Lizards working with Mechabeasts
yeah
I dunno if they were or if they were just at the same place, same time
I was just going with what the NPCs were saying.
13Whew, so glad my computer is fine again. Thought the OS or HD was somehow screwed.
2,14 yikes
2,14 glad to hear it's okay too :P
how was it turned off Octavia?
13I had it on lock and since I turn the monitor off while I have it locked, he simply pushed and held down the button.
2,14 what does the mobility stat do? evade?
9pretty much
9also
9back
9thought up names?
yay~
eh, to force it shut doesn't usually damage it
2,14 welcome back
Hey everypony
13Which in turn really messed it up. First time I've had that from turning it off.
Still going with Snails.
13Well, this time was different.
2,14 I vote something Rarity-like for the big laser
Dragon Claw for the finger poke thing?
Hiya Bronydude.
13And tell that to my old Sony.
2,14 Like Rarity Beam or something...
Hows everyone doing?
Gem Storm?
maybe it was because of the fact that it was under lock
13Maybe. But I've ever had that issue before.
13*never
13Not with this computer anyway.
dragon Slash?
13I seriously thought someone must have took something out of it or did something more to it.
Aww yeah, Dragoon Claw
Which one was O Slave?
Gems.
Glad every thing is ok Octavia
Apparently, anyway
O Slave is the gem storm
6Glad to hear your computer is saved~
gotcha.
13Me too Sumica
2,14 Rarity Storm, love it
Octavia, you thought it had been tampered with?
2,14 I approve of your naming DCD :P
13Yeah
Oh man.
What is this gonna be
I'm sure that spear should make us think of the Heroic Spike dream sequence
13It was giving me the signs the OS was gone or corrupted
Yes.
6bootmgr.exe is missing
13lol
is the stream off or is my comp being a pain?
6OH FU--
Bronydude, you on bronystate.net?
13I thought maybe my roomie or one of his friends, since none of them like me too much right now, had intentionally done something to fuck it up.
9approved?
Huzzah.
/me stamp of approval
What do the P and C's mean after the attack names?
yeah
9P is Physical I think
P is melee and C is Combo
9as in, not a Beam attack
9C is for Combo
6. . . Remember what I said about this last night Octavia?
9no no
9Melee is the Fist icon in front of the attack name
oh wait no im now
excuse my fail
9I think B is Beam
9P is Physical
wait, there are fist icons?
Never noticed em before
And the + sign in front instead of the fist icons?
9(would not damage Phase Shift armor, for example)
9it's a crosshair
Back
9for ranged attacks
Ohhhhhh
9so Nomenclature Approved?
2,14 what exactly is combo for?
was using an ancient link
9well there's a pilot skill named Combo
im checking out cool rooms that might stream season 2
9it will have a level
9when you are in front of an enemy
9and that enemy has another enemy adjacent to them
9say, behind them
9you can attack them both
Sounds like something to abuse maliciously.
ooh, chain attacks
9if you have Combo Level 2 you can chain it to two other enemies as well
9not really
2,14 ah, I see
9since enemies have to be standing RIGHT BEHIND each other
9in a straight line
9and all Combo attacks are 1-Range
Is that why the Combo version only has a range of one and slightly lower attack?
9okay, names approved?
9yeah
Looks good.
2,14 names look good to me
yeah
eeyup
I'm guessing you can only upgrade up to a max of where the blue starts for the mechs?
what game is this
?
Super Robot Wars.
Ziltoid: SRW Z
*J
9not really Espy
9when you fill everything that is not blue
Thisis snes game?
9you can access the Upgrade Bonus
no, GBA
9which you will choose once and it will be permanent
ah
HHHHHNNNNNGGGG I WANT IT TO SATURADY ALREADY
I can wait.
hey NewDCD, who are those? I never understood what the heck they were doing
I can't
9Brain Powerds
I wanna finish all weekend homework so I can spend all weekend in an squee fit
do they appear later in the game?
9yeah
how far later?
9Fluttershy would SO pilot a Brain Powerd
I guess she would
anyone else lagging?
seeing how they are well, brain-powered
Zil: a little bit, here and there
OH SHIT ANOTHER SEASON " CLIP ON EQD
Yep.
want to have a look at it Ziltoid?
It is glorious.
CMC being adorable.
oh boy
Nadesico
eeeyup Zephirdd
uuuuh what
I remember watching that anime a loooooooooooong time ago
is this
I don't even
SRW J, Derpmind
A massive crossover of all the robot animes ever made.
2,14 and it is awesome
2,14 pure awesome
indeed.
the Z2 one in the series is probably the most awesome of the bunch
It has Dai-Guard AND TTGL
2,14 All I want is Veritechs and I'm happy
2,14 but I still need to get that PSP game....if only I knew how
What PSP game?
oh fuck i just watched it
SRW Z2
2,14 think it's called Taisen, right?
Yeah, Valthejean.
SO MUCH WANT
2,14 yeah, I want it hardcore
9Super Robot Wars Z2
But known as Super Robot Wars Z2
hehehehe
2,14 every time DCD streams it, I fangasm
/me brohoofs NewDCD
oh god, not her.
Not that captain.
2,14 lol I like Ruri a lot (as a pilot at least)
Not Ruri
I mean the captain. The main one
2,14 yeah I know, you were talking about the captain
The girl
2,14 I was just saying I like Ruri
Ruri is way better character I agree though
yeah, I don't like Yurika
Fukube is awesome.
I agree, Espy
JUSTICE!
SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE!!!
GOGOGO!!!
Hey NewDCD, what's the penalty for exiting that yellow grid? I never understood that
Aww yeah, Combattler V
2,14 Oh I can answer that
2,14 the yellow grid gives distortion field defenses to any Aestivalis inside it
ooh
9not really
so that's why
2,14 if an Aestivalis is outside that grid, it is incredibly vulnerable
9the Yellow Field gives you UNLIMITED energy
Aww yeah, Dragoon Claw
I think that was something from the anime.
OOOH
Unlimited energy
I like the sound of that.
2,14 wait, but it also gives you defense doesn't it?
9and since Distortion Field uses Energy
9like all other force-field type mech abilities
9you see it a lot more when on the grid
2,14 oh, I thought they needed to be in the grid to use the distortion field
also, NewDCD, what's the use of the various platforms for the Aestivalis? Are we supposed to outfit them depending on the situation?
So, is the goal to destroy all enemies, or to move the Nergal to the other side of the map?
kill all hostiles, EspyLacopa
dick missile...
2,14 well, they do different things
Scootaloo is a dodo
SHHHHH ZIL
2,14 like the artillery has longer range and stuff (assuming I understand right)
what I mean is, are there scenarios that would recommend changing platforms?
9they all have different stats and different weapons
Or is it always needed to have one of each?
well by needed I mean recommended
9just think about the situation you're in
9and what would they be advantageous as
9(when you get the Lunar Frame you'll probably be using that 24/7 though)
Hiya Nittany
is the Artillery frame generally useful?
Hi.
9in the right situation
2,14 personally I love the artillery frame
9specially when the user has Support Attack
2,14 but that's because I'm the guy who likes smiting people from afar
heheheh I liked to use my Banpresto mech (same as NewDCD) and tank attacks in the enemy phase, oneshotting them on the counterattack
(he had 8k hp)
2,14 yeah, I use mazinger and combattler for that
(2nd best mech had around 6k)
2,14 meanwhile I pick them off from afar with mai snipah bot
9boy Val are you going to love the Bellzelute Brigandy
I basically wiped an entire wave of enemies by finger crushing them all
2,14 I'm guessing my Bellzelute gets upgraded at some point?
yes, Val.
I think
9it's SRW
2,14 oh god....my body is ready
9of course the Original gets an upgrade of some sort
FINGER CRUSH-
Oh wait
DON'T YOU FREEZE NOW D:
wrong attack name
Darn it...
9It freezes when I type lulz
Natleyn, he's just typing in chat when it freezes
Oh.
so there's D&P bronystate sessions now
when the game isn't clicked on, it freezes like that
2,14 DCD: there's a setting you can enable so that it keeps playing when it isn't the active window
whoever wants to join, #Bronystate_D&P
9kills the audio though
It freezes when I pee?
2,14 ah
Whats my motivation MrChang?
2,14 still, better than nothing :P
you'll either have lots of fun
or have fun
Eh, as nice as that sounds. I have a bit of a headache atm
Maybe next time :P
aww
we have 6 adventurers so far
o-o;
2,14 man, I love Combattler V's ultimate attack
I may join at some point, MrChang
some point?!
9that isn't its ultimate
you can join at anytime
9it gets more later
ANYTIME
9and team-up attacks with Voltes
2,14 It gets something BETTER than the Super EM lazer???? holy fuck
I'm really tired today u.u
we're beginning trm
some of our core members are absent
Oh.
In advance, then:
kayne wasnt here today
etc
Can I be a sound wizard? >_>

REINFORCEMENTS
9Grunt
9Grunt like you've never grunted before
2,14 I would like Izumi...but I hate that he has to work together with those other idiots :P
Wat why Grunt?
2,14 laaaaaaaaaaaame
9Val
9just so you know
9Hikaru is basically madmax: the Real Robot Pilot
2,14 lol
9I'm not kidding, post-series she becomes a mangaka
2,14 not even sure what that means :P
9and she's delightfully nerdy
9that means CHICK IS A COMIC ARTIST
2,14 I still like Izumi :P
madmax should've lit the lightbulb about comic artist
Grunt like Tim Taylor on Tool Time?
Eh, Akito. What a poor fool he is... Getting in situations like he will...
TEAM-UP ATTACK
AWW YEAH
I LOVE THOSE
needs more gunbuster
9Alpha series has Gunbuster
did any of them ever get diebuster?
9not yet no
9RARITY STORM
9cue tits
TITS
lol
I fucking love that you can name all these things
No Gunbuster? ;~;
I need to download this. Also need to download a GBA emulator.
got to love diebuster it uses planets as weapons.
Damn, now I want to watch Diebuster again
I'll find a torrent or something later >_>
/me has it.
Ahh. O:
not sure if i have the tracker for it any more.
Is Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier any good?
9supposedly
9but it's a spin-off
so there I was, checking out a boxset of dr.who at my uni's library. I casually remark where dr.who was made "england" and the nice girl behind the counter asked me how i understood them. Apparently people in england do not speak english
9I'd recommend you to play the GBA OG games instead
mfw
Did you tell her you understand them because of magnets?
sadly I did not, she was to cute to make fun of to her face
9People in England
9speaking english?
D:
9surely, you jest?
2,14 it's a lie
9*!
2,14 obviously Dari has been speaking in Mongolian
no, i repeatedly said "england" and "Britain" and she asked me if they speak english in a completely serious manner
no no it's welish
The girl prolly spoke of the accent
its not that different, you just add 'wanker' to the end of a sentence every once and awhile
Main reason I asked about Endless Frontier, is due to it being the only DS one that's been released in the US.
Haha
9Mugen no Frontier is actually a jRPG
9unlike the SRPG SRW games
Breast Fire...
Breast Fire is epic
Byoyoingg.
2,14 anyone else getting stream lag?
9it wasn't lag
9I got a pop-up notice on my end
2,14 ah, okay
Whirlwind?
no wiiiiirlwhiiiiiind
spiiiiiiiin
9brb
SCIENCE!
Goggles!
Spiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin
Those silly Jovian Lizards.
Quick, someone send some super robot anime discs!
9and that's it for tonight
9gotta catch up on schoolwork
2,14 awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
9not to mention work on preparations for Saturday
>:D fuckya bourbon night
2,14 well thanks for streaming dcd
Awwwww.
Thanks DCD!
Hi.
NewDCD, have fun
Cya NewDCD!!!!!
I just watched Broly the Legendary Super Saiyan on Nicktoons
Question, is talking about S2 episode 1 after it airs viable for a ban?
/me thinks that Dai-Guard is still one of the best mechs in the SRW Z2 roster
2,14 I would say don't talk about it until all rerun streams have finished
In otherwords, after the 26 episode ofS2?
2,14 but, I mean, this isn't really a set in stone kind of thing
9Barry: good question. We probably should make a spoiler room
you can obviously talk about the episode while we're watching it
2,14 I would say just be reasonable about it
I guess he means when we're about to stream episode 2
No, I mean say between Monday and Saturday after episode 1.
Valthejean: ever seen anything Dai-Guard?
the samewith episodes 2-26
2,14 I'll talk it over with the other mods, and we'll let you know barry
2,14 Derma: yes, I was there when DCD streamed it :P
K
I just wanted that cleared up
oh right.
Darn that show was awesome.
BABABABABABABABABABBABABABABABA
wait till like Sunday seeing as by that point we wont show it till it comes up in loto again =p
hey guys

LordCelestia: Someone is
MrChang

LordCelestia: #Bronystate_D&P

*spaceship is destroyed.* Gah, my spaceship! *armor is cracked* Gah, my space armor. "We get it, you're from space!"
I weld the mighty Cluebringer.
Invites aren't really necessary...
Good night yall
Good night WhayPayne
Good night,Whatpayne
Night WhatPayne
Why thank you Barry
And Natleyn
Silence?
2,14 indeed
What's going on?
2,14 silence, that's what :p
why, though?
2,14 I dunno :P
Because it's quiet time.
It's Fluttershy's game.
but that's for kids!
/me squees
Yeah, well, Fluttershy's version of the game is more "who can hold their breath the longest", than "who can stay quiet the longest".
2,14 no, it was quiet game :P
But why did she hold her breath?
2,14 meh, to get them excited :P
It's her winning method.
I guess if you're holding your breath, you can't make a vocal noise.
unless you sneeze, that is.
Wait register nicknames?
And something else that gets me. She said she was the world champ of the quiet game. Is there like a championship in Equestria for that game?
if so, must be a dull game.
I mean, even chess sounds interesting next to the Quiet Game.
Hi octavia!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1adNgZl_3Q
Everyone needs to play this game.
Now.
we have a bronystate D&P room, whomever is interested in playing, come join us at #Bronystate_D&P
I can't believe it's nearly over. 14 years it's been since Philosopher's Stone, 10 since the movie. Now, we're waiting on just one more video game, and the Harry Potter series will be over.
2,14 thank god
7 books, 8 movies, a myriad of video games, and one humongous fanbase.
http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=826
Do we have lego potter for all 7 books yet?
Im likin that one
That's coming out thisNovember
5-7
They may do a version with all eight movies in one piece, but that's definitely a 2012 release
if it ever will be released.
Wait, this video clip I'm watching is 10 minutes of that annoyingly cute squee sound?
Yes.
<3
It is the squee game.
You WILL lose to Fluttersquee.
If I turned it off <5 seconds in do I win or lose?
Forfeit.
:<
You didn't join because the game hadn't started yet.
Listening to it makes it sound like it's some kind of cat sound on replay
Ok, imagine listening to that for one hour or more
Can I just listen to Nyancat instead?
for one hour?
Sure

Sumica, are you actually gonna play?
Winter > Spring/Summer/Autumn
^
4What Dashite said
although last year i wrecked my car twice in the snow
Winter > Autumn > Summer/Spring
4That sucks
Completely agree.
Not that game tonight Natleyn
Natleyn.
I don't mean the real season. :/
no sound makes every one sad.
Ahh.
'kay.
Sumica, what's the url for the stream? i wanna try vlc
Although it is pretty awesome as well.
I'mma finish up this cursor and sleep >_>
might push it a bit with some full screen game off the pc though
Ghosties, it wasn't so bad since the deductable was half of the repairs
2,14 oooooh what game? :P
Not my place to give out stream info, you have to talk to colored text for that.
Lets try red faction:A
might lag to all get out though.
Only one way to find out.
i'll check the site's code for it P:
4Oh, that's nice. Guess it wasn't so bad
Ghosties, it's an 07 mustang so like...yah lol
4Haha, awesome
still under 40k miles
and i get my license back the 28th :D
4That's not bad at all, and I'm glad things are working out for ya
damn thing costs me 350 a month for car payment and 200 for insurrance
but i haven't missed a payment so it's helping my credit score i guess
got it when i was 19
4Yeah, that's gonna be good for the future. Your credit score is gonna help you get whatever else is necessary. By the way, how old are you now?
21
4Cool
i'm doing ok for a college dropout
ok stream will be up in just a sec....I think.
vlc doesn't do rtmp it seems
P:
man i hate using these flash players
oh hey, streamception
indeed
lol who's desktop
Sumica
oic
kimiko
yah i got sound
There is sound, it's pretty quiet though.
^
fine for me
this game looks kinda cool
obvious unreal3 engine
What's a monkey wrench? It's what I'm gonna hit you with if you don't shut your damn mouth!
i'm probably a few behind you guys
satellite connection
Some dude just fell out.
ok yah we're at the same point
HI Sumica!
So how bad is it?
OMG I SEE MYSELF
It was pretty good.
There was a little bit of stutter at the beginning, but it seemed to go away later on.
oki will go for a bit and check in as much as I can.
obvious lagg but it's smooth
I'm watching myself post!
nice backgroudn btw
WHOO
i want system specs later too
Let's check all his icons!
it bothers me that he's running xp
Tiny depressed trixie? must listen
Thank you...
Red Faction?
Yes
For giving me a chance, another chance I believe SR.
man if i didn't have satellite internet i'd soooo stream some shit
Hmm.. always wanted to see this.
just a sec started in wrong mode.
Oops, I gotta go atm.
Cya.

DARIUS

so you like?
yah dude
Must.. resist.. urge to torrent
this is red faction origins?
4I though about getting this
4But never did
4Guerrilla Warfare was badass though
i can only get 360 or ps3 versions
/me looks at other trackers
ctrlx, You have a PS3 too?
TrollightSparkle, nah. i have a hacked 360 but i prefer pc. since it's beefy enough to max out everything
PC Gamer master race! Woo!
Oh, ok. Hacked?
i can play copied games
Ah
no jtag though but i don't need that anyways
magnet goun for those that want to know
also, pc is always best choice
Night guys! :3
:33
er gun.
later Natleyn
Later NewDCD
Night Natleyn
/me hugs #bronystate
Er...
Natleyn
Dashite, lol tabfail
:3
/me hugs Vinyl and 'Tavi goodnight
<33
Natleyn is before NewDCD alphabetically, it should have come first!
i always do the first 3 characters
No more watered down bourbon!
FINE
although my typing is starting to go downhill. i can still proof it first :x
but obviously not drunk enough
the environment in this game is cool
how the buildings fall apart
hm. steamcracked version...
So.. who else is thinking of getting Serious Sam 3?
i haven't seen that yet
but i'll probably get it anyways
It looks pretty awesome, a throwback to the shooters of old ages.
i need to get another 2tb drive. i'm running out of storage
At least you have 2tb.. I'm running on 500GB here >.>
Only things I know I'm getting between now and the end of the yea are BF3 and Uncharted 3. Everything else is on a case by case basis.
Dashite YES
i have 2tb, 2x80gb, 2x750gb, and a 60gb ssd
:s
._.
I have 1x60GB SSD, 1x320GB and 1x 1TB
i've spent so much money on my comp
OS, Games, Data.
In that order.
Dashite, pretty much the same thing i have
my 2x80gb i use for random shit and virtual machines
did he just fuck all three of those guys?
at once?
I was thinking of getting an SSD when I get the money, should I?
Yup
And probably.
TrollightSparkle, yes
but
you need to be sure that you change some windows settings
like no prefetch. no hibernate. no defrag. and no pagefile on that drive
the fewer writes you have on it the better
sleep
Magnet gun never gets old.
What exactly is an SSD for? Just bootable OS's?
It's for speed.
TrollightSparkle, it's best for hte OS
well
best for anything lol
Most people just use it for OS because they are still pretty expensive so getting one for storage costs a lot of money.
i was thinking about getting another ssd for raid
i'm a raid freak
:p
then i'll buy a 750 off my friend so i'd have 2x60gb ssd, 2tb, and 3x750
but really i'm just waiting for bulldozer to come out
Wonder what kind of speed I'd get if I just short stroked a 2TB drive down to oh say 60GB...
“I don’t deserve them,” came the muffled reply. “I’m a horrible pony and I ruined the muffins and I ate the whole fridge and the world is ending and everything tastes of lemons and sadness.”
Dashite, like, omfg?
lol
but then you only have 60gb lol
and it still wouldn't match an ssd
:s
i short stroked both my arrays by 40%
why does Sumica have to do that thing to the walkways?
What thing?
that thing
he takes the gun out to make them appear
The blue glowy thing that rebuilds them after he blows them up?
hm
i'm liking these environments
does it use physx?
omg time to pee
Not sure what arma uses. I think the last one used Havok.
so you all had enough?
and the thing on the walkways it to repair them.
“Hurry up! Somewhere in the space-time continuum there are baby muffins, lost and alone, just waiting for us to birth them!” Derpy disappeared. Carrot smiled and shook her head, then left to join Derpy in the cool morning air.
i'll watch more
i still got 64% of my bandwidth left
or i'll skype lol.
wait i don't have a mic. nevermind :x
Sumica, what're your system specs?
I would use skype, but I can't.. since Linux is a b**** to work with.
quard core
TrollightSparkle, oh it's not that baaad
When you're a fledgling computer nerd.. yeah..
Carrot groaned. “Derpy, I’m serious,” she said. “It really wouldn’t kill you to try something different for a change. The world doesn’t revolve around muffins, you know!” Derpy laughed. “Carrot, I swear, you say the strangest things sometimes!” She trotted away happily.
Sumica, amd or intel? and gpu?
TrollightSparkle, i'll help ya :3
Thank you much :)
what distro do you got
I just use Empathy IM for the moment.
And Ubuntu 10.10.
I've been told to downgrade to 9.04, I'm thinking about it.
eehhhhh i don't like ubuntu but i can work with it.
i like redhat based distros better
like fedora
but htat's really just a personal preference
wait when did he get that suti?
I've only recently got into Linux, actually.
And that is a pretty badass suit, if I don't say.
TrollightSparkle, it's not too hard really. it's just different.
Yeah I know.
i would still say the best thing to know is comand line interface for anything
if you are comfortable in one then you'll learn how to run other stuff
Been trying to learn some of terminal, it's a bit confusing.
you'll get the hang of it
learn how to navigate then you can learn how to use specific programs
if you want to be hardcore, learn gentoo. that'll teach you a lot
I'm feeling in a bit of a hardcore mode, so what is Gentoo?
it's a distro that you build yourself from source code
Hmm.
That sounds interesting, but something I'd like to try.
basically all you have to do is partition, lay down the base system, configure, then compile in stuff you want
Hi guys.
you're kind of late for that post Dari
hey FlutterBro
I've been reading sooooooooooooooooooooooo much fanfic.
Well I can make that post while I'm not online can I?
can't*
I've been reading soooooooooooooooo much of this collage history textbook
You could make a bot for it, right?
he does have a bot for it i think
I think that yes, Rainbow-Dash
oh, just make it one of the mane 6 like you were plainng.
Rainbow-Dash: Nope, it only posts the latest one
it is a bot that posts those EqD updates
Ah, I see
[15:59] <FlutterBro> You could make a bot for it, right? The bot would still connect from my computer
Are you gonna try again to be the guy?
XD
So when automatic updates strike (like during this night, EVIL DOER!), it'd still DC.
I'd have to learn how to make a chat bot first ><
Dari is going to try to be the guy again?
then'd I'd have to find out how your bot gets the feed.
ohai ponynaut
no
Dat tabfail.
XD
Hey.
:c y u so p ponychat
Is there any way to stop mode messages showing up?
So when I voice someone, nothing shows up? :o
gpedit dari
Mailbox Login: pontang@ponychat.net (use the whole thing!)
wow
Because other than a server module, a voice/devoice bot would be the easiest way I could throttle messages to a channel.
wat
wow
Change the settings so it only does updates when you tell it to
And all the +v/-v spam would kind of ruin that.
Or you could find somewhere to host the chat bot and control it remotely
My voice is even worse than yesterday. XD
Thank you. :>
Flutterbro, where is Fluttershy?
Mmhmm :-)
DecapKnight: At college right now. I'm at HS right now waiting for my next class
which is a college class in 20 mins
what do you mean wait for your next class?
I'm doing concurrent enrollment.
you lost me at concurrent
I'm taking college classes in High School
oh
So am I
remotely through a big TV
I'm taking classes that are a collage level
but I'm in an actual class room
I'm taking real college classes.
and I forgot to bring my homework ><
I would but I'm only a sophomore
It's still in the printer at home
thats one reason why I like to use google docs
I can print it here, but it would cost some money.
are you at a collage?
I'm at my high school
your high school charges for printing?
I'm not sure actually
The "Time Until Next Stream" says "Show Time!" but the video says "this broadcast is offline. Please check back later." is this normal?
seems like it
Flutterbro where the hell is this high school?
DecapKnight: Utah
well, all i know about there is that there is snow and desert
Flutterbro, you have my condolences
and apparently a lot of Mormons
Northern Utah is pretty nice
well Northern Wisconsin is nice in the summer at least
what IRC server is this?
in the winter it sucks
oh, fun fact: over 60% of our land is locked up by the government!
Fun Fact: Wisconsin has the same type of weather as Alaska in winter, which is usually around 0 to -15 degrees daily
Oh, and the best way to desricbe N. Utah weather is bi-polar
really cold in the winter and really hot in the summer
the best way to describe the weather here is full blown schizophrenic
seriously
O.o
today its around freezing
tommorow its supposed to be around 70
thats crazy
yeah
I won't usually be able to chat during school though
this room is usually blocked
almost time to start class.

2,14 "we". I don't recall you ever being in that kind of position :P

lol
oh
so thats why i dont know what it is
Pontang, no, that is a horrible link!
I can't see the broadcast :(
2,14 that's probably because no one is streaming :P
Lez miz is usually the name given to the play. While Les Miserables is often considered the book. :I
Maybe :p
lol
2,14 stop me violet....I'm reaching for my trident
Read the book.
It came first.
;x
I might try reading it
I don't either, the text looks werid, i can't work out if i am misspelling things

I wanna see how well this channel will hold up Saturday
it will succumb to nothing-ness
i've done that before

I don't it's far from reasonable to say we'll have 2000 people
I don't think*
hey Luna
Oh Hi Luna
Hi Luna
Yo, Luna
Shidoshi: unless they will have fixed the chat problem by then, I think the chat will be capped at 200 peopls.
/me returns
I think they fixed taht back when we did the stress test back last week.
/me gives Luna a potato
/me pokes Luna about the op interview
I remember there were more than 200 people when you had that test

/me hugs Luna
/me hugs everypony
6Oh look what you have done now. I am a potatoe.

True, but cant force people to log in for stress test =p
/me tackle hugs Luna and VioletVanilla
/me hugs VioletVanilla

i took two hours off from work just to see mlp
I just tossed my heartstone in Dalaran. With its handy portal over to Stormwind, the only major place I can't get to quickly is Shattrath.
It's cool Turgle, I took amost two weeks

If ponies aren't a good enough reason to take time off work then nothing is
where is my electrical tape?
^
Sumica, usually under the desk
World of Warcraft needs more pony.
That it does
I must find it because I need it FOR SCIENCE!
Blizz should make a reference
07World of Warcraft needs more lore / epic quests
07less grinding
In fact, it they should have Achievements referencing MLP coming in next patch or after
An achievement titled "The Magic of Friendship"?
Friendship is magic: Convence Deathwing to give it all up and go sleep somewhere else.
World of Warcraft? Please, I've had enough of my friends talking about it all day every day in school
6Less grind pl0x o:
And as grindy as WoW is now. . .it used to be soo much worse.
Oh so much worse.
I'm SURE at least 20% Cooler will show up at some point
Oh Wow isn't grindy at all if you compare it to other MMOs
Shit, you have an entire heirloom gearset now to help you level
MFW all MMOs are 'grindy'.
Hey Luna when is that "soon" you will be streaming?
It's all a grind, wow just is the gear grind at the end.
Woops
6>mfw I do not play MMOs because of thus fact
Pontang: I hadn't identified.

Magic is friendship!
is anypony here a fan-fic writer?
So I had two ideas for fics the other day, one where I'd introduce RD's family that she ran away from when she was a filly(and kicked out of flight school) and other that would explain the creation of Equestria, as a new world born from the rotten human world by the sacrifice of the last human life
which one should I write?

ValtheJean, your opinion: Would you rather read a fic about RD family based on this image http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qJjzmcNx2Y0/TnEhmbU6gFI/AAAAAAAAMME/HXe1eVJ84ZY/s1600/rainbow_family_by_equestriaboy-d470z7b.png

Steampunk Twilight shirt?
2,14 Option C: I don't fucking read fanfics

*facehoof*
That looks like Rainbow Dash always dresses in style ;P

and stuff

/me is back
thought*
/me hugs luna
/me waves to Luna
hey luna, will you stream some House MD?
/me hugs Luna
07nope
lol :P
All better :D
05brb
before i start drawing Luna i need to finish this inFAMOUS 2 mission. lol
the chat appears to freeze after i talk or is nobody talking?
Ok now that fun is resloved.
07it's a bit silent
2,14 GHOSTS
Everypony's in #help
people are having issues LordCelestia so most are trying to get them fixed or just stay connected.
yeah i was too but mines fixed
Um. So will you Luna some day start streaming House MD again?
Maybe not today, but in say next week, or?
I just read part 4 its sweet and it involves LUNA
LUNA!
wow
hey decapknight, you're still on
?
you are still on
not gonna spoil anything tho
hey
hey mrchang
1/3 of the way. why?
whatsup?
lol that new comic. made it to spikes comment before i was laughing too hard to continue.
looks like D&D is over
oh, why is that?
nobody showed up
xept razyn
oh
Which comic?
well that doesnt mean we dont have later
right?
Hello? Is this thing on?
lol
that comic
Pee?
05oh the hilarity
Haha!
yes the title gave me a momment for pause too.
Just read it. INSTANT FAV
Interesting how House MD teached me that urine is sterile.
lmao
So I kinda side with Twilight there.
Rainbow Dash Truely Is The Best Pony EVER
so if i pee on a cut on my leg, am I cleaning it???
yes
awesome
:D
But also remember that urine is good growth environment for bacteria
its also a mild acid, so it helps neutralise some venoms
if you get stung by an insect in the wild, and you dont have any other options, pee on the sting and it might help neutralise
That jellyfish sting pee thing is urban legend. Does not help
thougth that was only for jellyfish stings.
not jellyfish...
bluebottles
same familt
family
LMFAO
but different venom
THAT MADE MZY DAY
"pee on the sting*
it works....
Seriously if you pee on jellyfish sting it might even make it worse
ive tried it myself
i know its just the way it sounds
I will just stick with the mythbusters methiod of using vodka.
BAHAHAH
is stream up, or is my interwebs durping
Well, ive got an english exam to go to, but ive been sent here for season 2 airing
is this true?
Yes.
Season 2 airs Saturday
We all been asking for stream...
9am EST i hear
ok, and will this have live upload
so i hear
live streaming of the ep as it comes on hub yes
speaking of, is there a second airing on Saturday? I probably wil have other plans
9am EST, that means it's 16:00 in GMT+2, right?
2,14 I don't know about saturday, but there are reruns on sunday and monday
i think so, whatpayne
either that, or 2:00
Excellent. I'll have to mark that on my calendar
ValtheJean, think we'll be streaming those?
2,14 that is up to Sumica :P
Well I'll play it safe and come online hours before
oro?
OK, thanks everypony, looking forward to SEASON 2 WITH YOU ALL!

07See you soon Mauran!

oh, bye all
Selene = moon goddess of Greek mythology ( I think)
I'm 16 so it would be really early for me to think of names for my future kids
i'm turning 20 and have too much free time for thinking
I'll start thinking names for my kids when I'll have someone to have the kids with.
hrmm, i don't remember why i thought it up a few weeks ago when i did.
probably some conversation i was having
Hay ponies
hey RP
Hello there RobotPinkie!

That was convenient

Yes it's the merger. Caused my password to reset.

Love that pic too WhatPayne!
RainBroDash do you accept mai challenge?! >>
sorry for interrupting, but we are watchingthe 1986 mlp movie tomorrow, yes?
It's so cute
Yes Elky
2,14 eeyup elky
thanks
10`Fluttershy oh for f-
/me steps to the side, hiding from the potential explosion of combat between `Fluttershy and RainBroDash
10I ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENNGE~
(Waifu, don't hurt her please...)
10Silvermane, you saw what happened when I caught you eloping with Dman
-points, gulping- Then...
Some how i dont see this being any thing like ironpony.
10shit's going down. RBD-style.
We need a way to battle!
10erm erm erm
10D:
RainBroDash, that wasn't me, I swear! that was an actor in a movie!
/me 10is stumpted
RainBroDash :O Is that why I don't see Dman anymore?
I know! -starts running towards RainBroDash full speed- AHHH
>.<
10RDash, shit good point, where has he been?
I recomend jello wreseling. only spelled the right way.
why is it, that the one time somebody ships me with another colt, it gets held above my head forever
Sumica, FUND IT
No clue, it's been awhile
10probably schoo-OH MY GOD
/me 10parries `Fluttershy
how do you parry a run?
/me yelps and falls on her back, then gets back up and shakes her flank >>;
10easy
side step with a push?
10you parry it
/me 10bows
/me grrrs and flies up into the air
SilverMane With a hop, skip, then a jump
/me then proceeds to drop on RainBroDash from above
10D:
(DAT FACE, also, lol RDash)
/me fwomps on top of RainBroDash
/me 10attempts to jump out of the way, instead getting a face-full of `Fluttershy
Are we Bronies normal?
#help
10owie~
10suddenly: Ghosties requiring help
10:3
HA!
WhatPayne, a filly is attacking a colt for the title of Waifu of Silvermane
I WIN!
I take that as a "no"...
sounds like a reasonable answer
:D
10`Fluttershy the fight ain't over till the fat pony sings
WUT?
/me goes to find Rainbow Dash
2,14 there's a Rosie O'Donnel pony now?
You wanna challenge me further?! ARE YOU CRAZY?!
oh i'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
10XD
/me 10beckons `Fluttershy
10Bring it~
10silvermane, you fff
:D
<3 U RBD
/me graaars and scuffles her hoof, making a flying charge this time
/me 10lets out manly pony-roar and returns the flying charge at `Fluttershy
/me watches while listening to "My Plague" by Slipknot
10(inb4 DragonBall-esque ball-of-boom)
neat
THE TWO CLASH MID AIR! SUDDENLY A INSANE BOOM OCCURS AND `FLUTTERSHY IS SENT FLYING INTO WALL
/me 10tumbles backwards across the ground
10I don't think that worked out well for either of us...
/me skids against wall and lands with a flop on the ground. "O-Ow....!"
DO IT AGAIN!
10O.o
/me stands up shakily, pointing her hoof. "IT'S STILL ON!"
/me 10clambers to his feet wearily
10Erm, is there any chance we could not fight to the death? I quite enjoy my life
/me sighs. "Why can't my fillies be normal for once?"
I have the dumb.
/me shakes out her flank, starting a stumbling charge
"Because its fun to watch Silver"
I am sure you could just share SilverMane
This is a fun chat to lurk
19:00 is not 5pm.
/me 10widens his stance "Here we go"
Sumica, frankly it's THEM that need to share
I have no idea why I thought that...
I EVEN HAVE BATTLE MUSIC
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAeBHMVS4l4
yeah that's what i am trying to tell them.
seems oddly peaceful at first
sounds like TouHou
/me 10turns on battle musi-*buffering*
/me 'GRAHS' and speeds up, lowering her head for a... headbutt
Sumica, yell it at them then
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J16_0jKu4A8
SilverMane: Yes it is Tohou )
have some metal fight music
ffs
you guys have such bad battle music taste
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jmty_NiaXc
I lurk almost everyday
/me 10extends his arms and cushions the charging headbutt, momentarily frozen holding `Fluttershy back
/me 4is currently listening to: Pelican
TouHou battle music is not pathetic! >> )
I mean. Sad. )
<< )
Lawl.
WhatPayne: I lurk 24/7
/me only pushes forward harder with all her might, tears in her eyes "I'm... not... going... to... GIVE IN!!"
My dad mixing coke and red wine for the lulz.
It tastes weird.
/me sits down in the corner, reading a psychology book. "Hopefully they don't kill each other. I'm running low on Phoenix Downs"
(He earned the nickname 'curle' king' for a reason)
curdle*
I'd lurk 24/7 but I have habit of turning off the computer when I go sleep
/me 10takes `Fluttershy's newfound momentum and flips `Fluttershy over his shoulder
4PM
Ohai Polarfire. <333
/me yelps in pain as she's flipped over, slammed into the ground
:p
/me comes back with tacos
they still at it?
Ohai Dari <333
10mfw dari x polarfire is canon
WhatPayne: turning off the computer? Bah!
10I thought it was only in my head
I know, I know...
If I turned my computer off, I wouldn't be able to run progress quest 24/7 :(
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9XR4rAmYtA
/me groans, then kicks out her back leg. "IT'S NOT OVER!"
Fight Music!
The what now?
Rainbro, its been canon for awhile now XD
10`FLUTTERSHY OH COME ON! Can we not make a deal?
"NOOOO" >>
they sure are, Sumica. *turns a page*
"FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!"
/me 10is exhausted and exasperated
/me offers SilverMane a taco.
10Fine, a fight it is then.
/me cries. "I never got to ship with Sexy-Voice though!"
/me glares, standing up and panting
/me takes the taco, solaced by it. "Thanks Sumica"
I'm sitting in on a lecture for a class I've taken twice now.
/me 10lets loose a roar and gallops full-pelt at `Fluttershy with newfound enthusiasm
"Wait! Can I have in on this fight?"
If anyone's interested, here's chapter two of my story.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDl5sgHDuwLaGv_VbCV90Yns3uk1C_KWvrivR6fk4CA/edit?pli=1&hl=en_US
/me eyes widen, but she flies up into the air wearily, dropping as he comes underneath her
DecapKnight, you want to earn the title of Waifu of Silvermane?
this seems more fitting for this kind of fight.
/me 10slaps decapknight around the back of the head "It's bad enough having my throne contested by one pony"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jkNTPJ11eU
"Nope. I just want to fight"
wait... final fantasy XIII-2 music?
/me 10looks up in despair "Oh sh-"
how did you...
>mfw I need access to view Barry doc
how is 13-2 music even out yet?
10SilverMane because magnets.
that's Tam for you
/me lands again on RainBroDash with a fwump, but groans in pain as well as she collapses on him
*sigh*
fixedit
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4_kNmMCt54
"So I can fight then?"
/me stands up, shutting his book. "Never going to get any work done with those two..."
wat
/me 10flops to the floor under `Fluttershy's weight
seaponies fic?
niiiice
"H-ha... I win......"
just keep in mind the prize is SilverMane DecapKnight
More like ponies at sea
"I'll take the silence as a yes
/me goes over to the pile of pony. "You two are so weird."
DecapKnight the prize is SilverMane >>
/me charges towards `Fluttershy at full speed
/me eyes widen "OH SH--" Is hit and flies back again, collapsing on the ground
And all things that winning SilverMane entailes
mfw somepony has to write a DecapMane fanfic because of this...
Nope
Fluttershy can have him
I just wanted to fight
/me groans, then passes out
10>MFW `Fluttershy can have him
10NO
"Well, thanks for the fight"
Yay.
10woohoo :3
4Thanks, man :3
Tam, you play so good.
No problem.
lol I love violins, Tam is good
NO! It was an unfair fight! >>; DecapKnight interrupted and... well... ._.; )
so wait... who won?
meh, what do I care?
-points to her unconscious body on the battle field- )
you win in the end SilverMane
/me grabs `Fluttershy and RainBroDash by the tails, dragging them off to his private chambers.
You know it, Sumica
SilverMane x SilverMane ?!
I'll be back in a few days >.>

10^^^^^^^
DO IT NOW
/me RAGES
lol
Sumica: Nope
Thought I had to at some point
odd
05whats with my timing?
GAAAHHH
That spoiler totally ruined everything for me :(
Nevermind that, I know I'm going home soon and my nick is gonna get stuck
So dead island kind of reminds me of Jurasic park just with zombies instead of dinosaurs.
Jurassic Park 4 may be out by 2013
4?
O_o
to me, dead island reminds me of dead rising 2, left for dead and borderlands mixed into one game
*MILK* *MILK* *MILK*
wait...
Yes,4
they're making another sequel?
it's been like, 10 yars
years
Not just another sequel, they plan to make a second trilogy
bleh
so who are they gonna write back to life this time?
Lul
10I can't wait for Starcraft 3 in 2023
no clue
Godzilla
10tis gonna be epic
huh?
lol sc3
why do you think it'll be out 12 years from now?
I hated Jurassic Park II
because sc1 and sc2
2 more or less killed it
took 12 years
^
Because I read the book first
lol
every movie based on books
sucks when compared to the book
I mean, see HP and the Half Blood Prince
Yeah but it does not have to be like that.
then you'd need two parts for each book, and it would still be weird
(see HP and the deathly hallows)
I ratehr liked the first JP movie even after reading the book.
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was dull anyway, even as a book
Meh, I like all the HP books.
they fucking cut off the fighting scene of the book from the movie
More than the films too, even though I love the films.
instead of badass fight with blood
they just broke glasses and set something on fire
10ITT: people dissecting entertainment to an unnecessary level instead of just enjoying it
Deathly Hallows was probably one of the dullest movies made.
Michael Crichton The lost world was really good. And somehow Spielberg took all the good things away from the adaptation
Lol RainBro.
RainBroDash: this is no topic, this is chat u silly :d
Fair enough.
I agree.
/me 10was just stirring shit
And added that dumb sequence where the T-rex goes to San Diego.
ughh...
10I do believe what I said, but I only like to say it because it gets people riled up sometimes
Hey guys I'm sending this from my iPod isn't that great haha
You are no Dari RBD =p
Shitty quality tho, gtg
so, is something on stream?
10sumica I know, and if I tried to be I'd fail
10he was just born twisted :3
lol
oh right, forgot I was going to buy some a splitter cable. Back in a few.
10baibaaiii
My biggest achilles heel as computer guy is
Having blue screens of death, where the blue screens don't actually have any information on the problem that caused them
hi
You can debug the shit out of a minidump file all you want, but if you need to distill them driver by driver, you're better off doing a clean install
for some reason I can't use just FlutterBro

If you lick me you will look like droopy-eyed, armless children.

RainBro hates me so much he won't do even give me one tiny act of kindness. ;___;
Maybe he can't sing?
>I can't sing
>still did
10>you were made to
And other people sang when I asked them to.
10>because peer pressure

RainBro is the only one who flat out refused.
Oh no...
/me 10is a strong, stubborn bastard. It makes me feel better about me

I've never sung, not that I will right now.

Watermelon is easily best fruit.

Hey, had anyone here won the internet?

pomf is the sound effect of wings unfurling rapidly in arousal
pomf is the sound of hitting a pillow while being seduced
aka pomf = Wingboner

Testing 1-2-3. :megusta:
I have minecraft, terraria, MH3 and generally anything free to play. No FPSs sorry
>got minecraft, mosy play shooters but enjoys Command and conquer games
mostly*
ugh. Is the Bronystate.net stream up? Or all they all down? And why do I feel so alone in this chat here?
2,14 stream is down, yes
trust me its better on friday night and will be even better on season 2 stream
I see. I thought maybe my computer was being retarded :/
I just want to do something fun with some of you guys.
so bored;
yes Val. audio spliter seems to want to piss me off today.
When does the marethon start?
Sooooo.....how about them Minecrafts? 1.8 seems...fun. It's a lot more laggy now, though. My average FPS is in the 50's now..
Yeah Reaver21, spme times I too have to check if i'm getting through. I guess it's the nature of this chat.
1.8.1? sure I'll do that.
Yeah... my FPS dropped a whole ton after upgrading to 1.8
I dont have minecraft
same here Robot
I'm guessing it's the new world generation code
It's a lot more elaborate
Mine too.
though i run it on laptop and am hoping of gettin a job to by a good computer
yep
thats the sprit!
The new biomes look crazy awesome
whos hosting?
Well, if you guys ever host a server that doesn't have the Valid-ID check or whatever, go ahead and tell me now :D I R a pirate!
well im off guys,
cya
Ciao Dash!
so anyone here gonna Minecraft with me? I'll start a server...
Luna, you troll
As long as it's not secured, I'll join. I'll need an IP though obviously~
...minecraft.net is freaking out on me.
I wouldn't know, My copy is illegitimate~
MYRIKA!
Does anyone know what the experience levels do at the moment?
Robotpinkie, I have no clue~
nothing!
ok every one geting sound and video now?
oh there's stream?
Who's playing
I'm attempting now.
I'm getting both
/me waves
Sumica, you are the man
go pwn something!
This game has a really good story :0
...And really long
:eeyup: I'm in
:D
eeyup
*4-disk game nostalgia*
Or not. Now the chat is weird. I like bunnies.
testing
Wait, fuck, I'm not old enough for nostalgia
Yeah, it's slightly unclear to me, is there some "ban" for shows being streamed, or what?
Yay! It works!
we dont want to risk it geting shutdown so close to s2
2,14 it's better to play it safe
Wait, what's this about bans and whatnot?
Ahhh
That makes sense.
ooh cutscene!
mfw ps1 graphics that can hold ground with modern movies
Ah... Did I miss it, or was this explained somewhere because I've been wondering this throughout the whole day here...
GOOOOOD I LOVE THIS GAME.
This is my childhood :0
ooh, weird mounts
Whatpayne, you know more than I do..
Apparently not, as I just heard this.
You have yo admit, these graphics are more than amazing for ps1 graphics
to*
Gah forgot about the dualshock vibrating.
wonder how long it took to render the cutscenes
The music
No, I don't even really know what "it" is!And HeroSpirit, these are all pre-rendered. It's a video.
OH THE MUSIC
I know.
I know its pre-rendered, but I'm just wondering how long they took the first time.
But most ps1 cutscenes weren't that good. At least not in the games I played. :0
So they aren't actually PS1 graphics, but rather.. PC graphics.
Reaver21: What it you mean?
"it"
In reference to something about the stream being banned or something and "playing it safe".
Blarglblarg I'm still nerding out over this, I'm sorry
no voiceovers?
Oh, no, it's cool Herospirit. In fact, I blame chat lag for my responses.
I want a remake of this game. And a movie. And a sequel...
And a chain of tiny tea cups
And....
MFW
Oh gog I'm draw some Dragoon ponies!
I'ma*
So, I'ma ask this question and then leave. Is the Season 2 premiere AM or PM?
AM
Saturday morning
that's a "dragon?"
Thanks! I thought so :D
Ciao, mah bronies!
Yeah I and many others been asking about the stream throughout the day as we often get these minor streams by Luna and others. And I suppose I missed someone at some point explaining the reason there would not be any "copyrighted" streams today due not wanting to risk it this close to season 2.
6Take care Reaver21!
Yah, dragon
And he just leaves as I'm about to explain where we (I) stand...
lol
SHOT DOWN, Payne
Huh. What game is that?
:(
On the stream
"Legend of the Dragoon"
legend of dragoon
It is my childhood. :3
Oh yah, no "the"
I feel so cold shouldered right now...
hop that fence like a man!
The fighting is... really unique for an RPG
Huh. An odd new game is being streamed?
An odd old game
This game was my favorite. EVAR.
oh right quick time fighting
What the hay. My password for this nick isn't working.
...And I've decided I should make ponies of the characters
07that's correct Espy
To the help channel!
The major part of the fighting in this is that you can get different quick time combos
The higher level ones are stronger, but have much harder timing

Oh yah... you need cards for PS emulators, don't you
Really, SilverMane? I hope it's available in Europe, then...
Or is this not an emulator?

I hate when games come out on PSN only in one region...
Wait, this is on PSN now?!

I'll answer

Yes it is a good game
Yeah, getting a bit of lag when the movement speeds up.
Well I'll watch and see if i want to pick it up sometime

It's especially fun when you get your Dragoon powers :3

I think it looks pretty hot

Tasman: "Need practice? Come stab me repetitively!"
oh god, accidentally paused the stream, lol
Lol

Out of the "Mane" 6, who would you be most inclined to kiss? It would be Twilight for me, I guess.

I'd be most inclined to kiss...

honestly, Twilight as well
>implying you wouldn't if it were Dash
Could be a kiss on the head or something
Doesn't have to be their pony form
Fluttershy I just want to hug, pinkie pie frankly would buck me if i tried probably

I see your point Scotch
yeah!
suddely retrospective
boxy box!
What point did I make?
I almost thought it was one lol
4Whoa
guys stop talking about kissing ponies.. you're going to get someone else to starting thinking about it and eventually it'll actually start happening until we realize it's just our imagination and all we were kissing is whoever was right next to us which is usually a bro
4Deja vu
lol
cute!
wtf?
>implying that it's wrong to kiss a bro
did that dog just... yell at him?
lololol

how can they make such HARD games for kids?
Yeah, it was hard.
lack of playtesters?
Not ending up with the turdmon digimon was pretty tough.
Man, I'm kinda glad he missed that
cause kids are better at them than older people who don't play games
half the games for kids back then were impossible
Never knew where the next toilet was. >_>
Yeah

I mean compare the Genesis games I played as a kid with the games today...
/me comes back
Spyro 1, Crash Bandicoot 1, Croc 1, Digimon World 1...
/me sees "RobotPinkie goes to the closet to get the bag of ropes, straps and whips"
SPYRO <3
........
i grew up with them so i'm the ownage.. but if i hadn't.. if i hadn't....
Croc
Oh yeah
Damn that was a hard game.
Crash 1 was quite hard to beat...
Anyone here remember Gex?
I was kidding, herospirit, I swear I wasn't going to use any of that on SilverMane!
i do
That game was great. XD
indeed
i remember Gex
that game was kinda difficult
I remember Chakan the Forever Man
PS1
/me gets some of his own rope and makes a hanging chair, sittin' in it
Oh the nostalgia
...that was pretty hard
wait, robotPinkie, you have ropes?
......no comment
/me is floating
Spyro was BAMF
:P
..............
All the rope
ALL OF IT
/me opens robotPinkie's closet
..............
I remember one of the levels in Spyro 1 had an insane bit to get to.
/me closes RobottPinkie's closet
No comment.
why are we in RobotPinkie's house?
...don't tell anyone what you've seen today, herospirit
I'm in the chatroom. :<
No one will no
I will
know*
I will
....
What's this?
It has, like, a fireplace and rafters and stuff.
I am 12 and what is this?
You had to use the superspeed thing and zoom round half the map before flying off the edge into what looks as though it can hold nothing but death, before gliding far enough you reach a platform round a curve, so it's hidden from site during normal observation.
It was INSANE.
I loved it though.
It was epic.
Oh yeah, I think I remember that
oh god I remember that part. -_-
Can't remember which level exactly.
ya i remember that.. it took a while for us to find lol
Man, I kinda miss games being harder...
All I remember was you could hear the dragon statue through a wall.
dear god, i was 17 before i could 100% Spyro and Crash Bandicoot
And I was just wondering, hwo the fuck do I get there?
how*
I mean part of what makes things easier is infinite lives and frequent checkpoints, though.
Took forever to work out.
yeah, it was pure guess work that got me to it on my 100% run
BASTARD!!
FOAL!
Gog, those gaurds look like RobotPinkie's closet
wee! looting!
pretty much what silvermane said but when i did 100% crash bandicoot 2 i did it within a day lol
FOOL
Errrr
FOALS!
I mean
....
No comment
NO herospirit!
crash Bandicoot 2 wasn't hard
crash bandicoot 1 was a BITCH
it was for a kid who didn't know junk
take everything that's not nailed down!
you could not die ONCe
My secret dungeon must never be revealed!
Other crashes were cake compared to the first
...oops
Psychonauts?
and you had to find hidden tokens to get into hidden areas
i mean i couldn't figure out what i needed to know apparently.. i still don't know what it was i needed to know
Psychonauts?
What?
Dang it Pontang
Psychonauts?
Saints Row 3?
I love Psychonauts
bandicoot 1 couldn't be that hard.. and i stick to that
Fallout 2?
Prince of Persia Spyro crossover
FUND IT
My favorite part is inside the mind of the giant fish.
It's so goddamn funny
My favorite part is when i go and blow up that oil rig
anyone remember kickle cubicle?
PoP is a pretty cool guy.
anyone remember Fallout 2?
I've heard a lot of people talk about playing it, but never played it myself, MeteorVenture
Eh gets impaled on spikes and doesn't afraid of anything
huh.. i've never heard anyone talk about it until i searched for it but i've played it myself lol
no one here remembers Fallout 2?
I kinda do, DecapKnight
Decap: my bro plays F2. >_>
It's been a long time, though
it's a really great puzzle game though:D one of my favorites
what about Fallout?
Brotherhood of Steel is the best Fallout, clearly
trololololo
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
that thing should be nuked from orbit
Spears are cool
Pretty much, yeah.
Dooooown the hole

Eugh the movie.
Thank God it got cancelled.
>.>
REALLY? a movie?
Sparx I gotta say was pretty funny.
The movie of what?
Wait seriously
i like how David Spade played Sparx in Legend of SPyro 1
But overall I disliked the LOS speries.
series*
legend of selda
There was going to be... a Spyro movie?
:0
i liked how they stole the story i wrote in 5th grade for that game
TLOS*
Yeah, it was terrible.
For what game?
TLOS series
no loot?
In 5th grade, i wrote a story about Spyro fightin gan evil dragoness, beating her, and converting her, then dating happens
TLOS?
The Legend of Spyro
Lavitz is 100% man
Ahhhh

The 3rd one was interesting because it was pretty different.
You had free roam and free flight.

Which was pretty strange.
Hey StarStriker.

Shocking as that is.
-.-'

Like is such a stron word.
DARI
I don't even know what we are talking about and I agree
Your voice is sick? D:
NATLEYN

Ohai PONYFAG.

^

/me loves Ponyfag even more
lawl
silver.. if you don't want to play through FF7 again then try 8 or something
Ohai Mark
huh oh
MeteroVenture, no thanks. FF8 was... no fun whatsoever for me
who made the banner
Bahamut was a bitch to get in 8 >_>
on Eqd?
So, I was banned the other day, but this is uber easy to hack
about bronystate
and I did beat FF9, only FF I have beaten
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RFAzMkTwThs/TnJ4LjjzVKI/AAAAAAAAA8A/5_b_ZtkbzJI/s1600/Newsletter_Thursday.jpg
The banner.
this one
Let me check.
Argh, I hope I can pick up that sewing machine this weekend
le gasp! FF8 was pretty equal to 7 for me
I'm seriously in need of sewing some tiny dresses
I can't bring myself to play through 7 /or/ 8 again.
^what
Did it once.
because the times GMT are wrong, aren't they?
Im trying to get pink pinkie pie shirts
Since its daylight saving time atm
> mfw "sewing some tiny dresses"
For ponies, Natleyn :P
ok silvermane.. play legend of legaia then
7pm EST would be 11pm GMT0
If they ever remake ff7, i'll get it, but until then I won't touch it
never again
Zephirdd: I think it was SilverScreen
Oh.
I can't right now, because I have no sewing machine
Val did our logo in the bottom left though
MeteorVenture, i can't afford this long-rpg shit right now!
Oh wait.
wtf are we watching
just pointing out the times are wrong :P
No, Val did the newsletter.
2,14 no, I don't think we put it in there
Technically, the times are correct. However, you have to adjust for EDT, so when it says it starts at 7 PM EST, therefore it means for us eastern people on daylight savings, it starts at 8 PM.
Silver typed it up.
I have Dark Souls, Dead Island, Skyrim, Uncharted 3, Deus Ex, and so many others to get and play
Legend of Dragoon.
ah
^Ho shit
ok ok sheesh all you had to do was write an angry letter
Val
2,14 yeah?
Nice backup, Silvermane
You made the newsletter didn't you?
You went ahead and got Dead Island Silvermane?
yes, its EDT
2,14 yeah...that was me
And the logo
Yeah.
Hello
Thought so.
Oh wait.. Didnt read that right.. Nvm >.<
Rainbow-Dash, I went to, but the stores were sold out
And also Silver got the GMT times right.
STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!
i actually watched the last one get sold at Best Buy
but I did get Deus Ex
RobotPinkie: <3
omg this is like a crapy version of FF
So if I show up at this time tomorrow night, I won't be late?
<3
what time is it on the east coast
Because it is, right now, about 5 minutes away from 7 PM EST.
2,14 no, you'll be an hour late
Doesn't look crap to me. Looks pretty good.
right now?
2,14 it's 10 minutes from 8:00 EST
^This
Nope
lol i know but it just looks old
Yep
8 minutes
Hello
We're on Daylight Savings Time right now

sam r he jack
was there ever any sleep?
Faust seems to have a lot of faith in Thiessen
MeteorVenture: In your dreams.
Awesome
...i thought dragoons were just mounted foot soldiers.......im TERRIBLE at history....
Anon, we were going by video games :p
ANON: If you want to get /historical/ about it, sure.
Dragoons are like, the beast killing elite of the fantasy world
i thought dragoons were like lizard-men things with spears
mfw everyone is right
Huntin' dragons an' shit and jumpin' all over the damn place
im so confused at the moment
I'm pretty sure dragoons are mounted guys with guns
RISE OF NATIONS IS HISTORICALLY ACCURATE SHUT UP
I LOVE THAT GAME
Heh
ok sorry
I thought dragoons were the guys with the "jump" command
A dragoon in Real Life was a mounted warrior of elite status. In video games, it is many things, including a spear warrior that can jump, a lizard man, a magical hero, etc etc etc
What time CST tomorrow is the show?
haha pinkie
Obviously Dragoons are an ancient race of dragon riders
Geez
Do they fight the Thread?
That can shoot magic and shit.
Nice catch!
...and shit as in they do stuff, not that they shoot shit from their hands
did they fly dragons from skyrim (its not out yet though.....)
that would be gross
when season two start?
Thread?
^'course
SUDDENLY, TREE
RobotPinkie: Ah, not familiar with that book series eh?
We'd better get the good version of the CMC song some time.
I'd like to be a tree...
Oh god
Dari: Indeed.
Nope, EspyLacopa
YOU CUT DOWN FLUTTERSHY
CUT DOWN IN HER PRIME
Y U DO DIS
Dragonriders of Pern
I don't even know what the thread is and I've read those books
It falls off a moon or something?
muhahaha
It doesn't make much sense.
Worth reading, Espy?
But there was a lot of her stuff at dragoncon.

NY

0o ok
idk about US geography or state placement

My inner Boy Scout withers at the idea of people not knowing which side of the continent is east and which is west.

/me hugs Flootershai
:D
I GET TO SPELL HER NAME THAT WAY. <3
DE MAGIKS.
Oh, I has a question.
oh hey, legend of dragoon
i loved this game
/me walks in the chatroom, a boombox blaring "Your horoscope for today" by Weird Al on his shoulder.
so when someone asks...
Well hello Dermathil
Um, does the "live showing" include season 2 episode 1? I don't has cable and I want to watch it asap :3
Yes.
Yep :3

/me 4remembers this fight
I mean, Celestia and Lauren
KICK ITS ASS, SUMICA
what time is the season 2 episode airing on here?
Luna hasn't got the chance to troll much
Surprise: 9am EDT
wait, so Bronystate will steam it live from the Hub channel on TV or does the Hub stream it live too and they share it or something? I'm a confused pony.
Ghosties, you played this too!? : D
Alright thanks Zephir
/me waves at Ghosties, continuing to stroll around Doctor House-style.
I love this game. I've been nerding out about it all day.
a member of bronystate will stream directly from their TV
idk how
:P
but they tested it once
and worked great
ah, okay
we watched THE GODDAMN BATMAN here :P
workz for me!
xD
>.>
>mfw I don't remember the Hub streamer
Zephirdd: I'm pretty sure they use the technology that makes people able to make livestreams of them playing console games.
just wanted to make sure what all the hubub was about
i will see you all on Saturday at 9:00am!
no
you will come here tomorrow
7pm edt
See you soon, Flootershai
and watch movies with us
Flootershai, from what I understand, BronyState streams directly from TV to the BronyState website.
:0
ffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuu poisen
hubub... i see what you did there
and then stay awaken all night
wuts at 7?
watching MLP

...Now i gotta read 2 chapters of Catcher in the Rye then summarize it. Hopefully it won't take too long because I want to get to bed early because I FEEL LIKE CRAP.
to bad you can't turn into a super saiyan dragon yet
Cya'z! Love you all!
also, catcher in the rye is a terrible book

<3
kbyeforrealzthistime

4@herospirit: Only the demo
*bronystate added to bookmarks*
good luck, Flootershai. I read Catcher in the Rye for school myself a year ago.
she's gone
eeeeeeeeh
OMG, Legend of Dragoon. This is not something I expected to find today.
holden caufield makes hamlet look like a badass action hero
I love this game.
>mfw Bronystate has broken the 50-viewer cap on an off-movie night.
lol
rly?
:O
I blame the eqd post
like a bau5
It's because of the Season 1 marathon announcement :P
true
Same here, Sumica.
indeed
FFFFFFFFFF random encounter just outside town
it's THE STAREEEE
What are you playing Sumica?
what you see
Legend of Dragoon o-o
I hope we'll get to keep the massive ammount of viewers that's gonna come down tomorrow for the other movie nights.
He's streamin'.
So what am I watching here?
Ah, IC
Legend of Dragoon
egh.
I wish they would remake this game with better visuals. They could keep everything else the same.
It would still be awesome.
So long as they get anounced ahead of time I'll be there.
Going home.
Seeya soon, nittany
Hey, Sumica, you playing this on the playstation, or virtual machine? PC?
HEy guys im back
:D
ps2 routed through capture card
hi
is my little sister here?
you're sort of breezing through this, this is a jrpg dude. you got to put in the mandatory 30 hours of grind
Ah (actually has no idea what that means :P Was always more of a PC guy than console).
LoD has almost zero grind.
Well, maybe near the end, if you want to beat the Original Dragoons.
GRETTINGS BRONYSTATE
I kinda want to jump to my old save cause it has dragoons already.
Those dudes are touch.
only doing 1 damage?
1 dmg makes all the difference
hello Sharpe
What game is this anywho?
hello Sharpe as well
Oooh, Legend of Dragoon being streamed?
game?
yes, FreezeFrame.
I know FF, awesome right?
yes FreezeFrame
/me loads the stream
yes!
right?
Luna has gone to sleep.
I'm getting an off-air thing o.O
it says broadcast is offline for me. is this the site where s2 premier will be streamed?
yes
aw, ill see her tomorrow then
You're on bronystate.net correct?
Why are we watching someone play FF7?
Uh dinkypage.com/bronystate
yeah i am on same
lol oh you schrodingerfu
We aren't
Soooo we should go to bronystate.net?
Yes
It's Legend of Dragoon, which is infinitely superior to FF7
Okay then, brb
Is this game the Legend of Dragoon?
Yes.
LoD is probably the best JRPG I ever played, but I've only played a few JRPGs.
Well, I just watched Fusion Reborn on Nicktoons, and surprisingly, it was almost completely uncut
I knew it!
Golden Sun might be a contender.
Oh the irony for you all when this game was made in the US
I need to finish Dark Dawn
Golden Sun and its sequel were pretty good.
okay, i am on bronystate.net/theatre/ that is for s2 premier?
Snap, really?!? This was made in the U.S.?
Sebiale: I consider GS and GS: TLA a single game in two parts
And by that, I mean the only thing missing was everything concerning the character known only as the General.
Yeah, LoD Was made in the US, but it uses the JRPG gameplay standards.
Sweet, learn something new every day
you'd think that people would want to make fun of hitler
And im back
why do censors protect hitler so much?
Huh?
wat
cranberry was talking about a dbz movie
with hitler in it
>mfw reading the Q&A with Lauren Faust I notice that she says she lurks on EqD everyday
there is a dbz movie with hitler?
^yup
WAT.
its called fusion reborn, basically all the bad guys come back to life
The syndicated release cuts him out
Godwin's Law is universal
so hitler comes back and trunks and goten troll him
but he's in the uncut dvd
ah
lol
Yes
gotta dl that
sounds interesting
>mfw Lauren Faust dropped some spoilers on EqD for fun as an anon before...
if Lauren Faust is off the main production staff I wonder if she reads fanfics
whats the name of that movie?
Fusion Reborn
Trollen Faust is Trollin
KanyeEast: maybe...
She says she doesn't really have time for that, KayneEast.
Ah, one of the few games where attack items are cool
Trollin'
she doesn't have time for fics
You think Faust is gonna get her Galaxy Girls pitch picked up?
but she did admit to spoil some stuff as anon
If I worked the time right, the livestream for tomorrow will start at around 5/6 AM
I won't leave my room all day it seems :)
KanyeEast, she explicitly says that she don't read fanfics.
AM?
lol
where do you live
wth
AM
Minnesota
The show airs at 9 AM EST
er, EDT
tomorrow the stream starts 7pm EDT
Sat, or Fri
TOMORROW IS FRIDAY
Poster says 7 AM
am?
geez
Oh wait
nvm
lol
It is PM
Next Wednesday,on Nicktoons, Broly: Second Comingwill air
Well, that's even worse, now I won't sleep at all.
Hate Stardust!
No matter what awesome rewards it gives
Night everlasting
I hates those things.
Hey guys, just for clarification: These guys ARE going to be streaming the season premiere on Saturday, right? Live?
mfw people keep asking as if we're streaming today
Well, the stream begins on friday, but it runs till the premier on Staurday.
Bronys are just excited
As I understand it.
So yes, then?
yes Sebiale
Sebiale: This is correct.
oh look poisen guard...where was that 20 min ago.
lol
so we begin watching Blade Runner at 7pm EDT
Some items are not conveniently placed.
Like Kongol's Dragoon Stone
and then go for MLP The Movie (1986)
Not trying to step on any hooves, here, just wanna make sure I have my info right. I told my friends about it and want to make sure I hadn't informed then incorrectly.
Who would ever voluntarily go back so far to find it?
Well nice chatting, got to get back to work
and then we go for the MLP:FiM marathon all night
which will end around the premiere for the season 2
Is the MLP movie any good?
which we will watch live
probably not
lol
but that's the point
:P
it's the 'B' movie
Alright, so 6:00am PST, then, right?
I want to get back to work on my MLP monument tower, but the MC server is being troublesome. :(
mib_5vdrhi: for season 2 premiere, yes
lol gotta love whoever wanted that B movie
oops
#bronystate_d&p
nvm that
Bjorn did it MeteorVenture
and he did it to troll us all
:P
i look forward to watching it actually
MeteorVenture: Bjornfot picked it
It could be interesting, don't know...
And he got a flood of congratulatory PMs, because the channel was still in +m for the lottery
Thanks, Zephirdd
with a room full of bornies it's gonna be interesting at least
bronies* lol
I'm gonna watch it
4Don't forget, I also commended Bjornfot during +m

Hey NewDCD
Whatever happened to OldDCD?

9I would have sampled the stream for you so you could see teh quality, but

:C
And what does DCD stand for?
cause you know old ans such
Decade
9i get asked those questions a lot LOL

Kamen Rider Decade/DCD.
Okay.

9oh
9wait
9nevermind
OMG, I love these cutscenes.
9someone is streaming
the balloon version would be i wanna be inflated
Their CGI cutscenes are amazingly good for how old they are.
0Please tell me the stream isn't skippy for just me
Which is why i asked if you needed me to clear out DCD.
9nah Sumica it's fine
It's just you Razyn :(
9I'll stream a bit later
0nononononono This is bad.
9also that's quality as expected of one of my faithful students
It is for me, but it always is for me
0This is definitely bad
=p
Oh. OH
9so what game is it?
The music is coming up
Legend of Dragoon
Legend of Dragoon
THE MUSIC IS COMING UP.
9ohhhhhhhh~
9I've heard about that game
Dear DCD today i learned the perfect pixal meithoed.
GONNA HAPPEN
Dart's Theme?
God, Panzer Dragoon. THE MEMORIES, Sir.
0Dragons are cool. Dragoons are alright.
DART'S THEME IS GONNA HAPEN
Dart's Theme is awesome.
Er, Legend of Dragoon, not Panzer Dragoon.>.>
I used to just let the game still for long periods of time to listen to it.
where are my ponies!?
I did too Sebiale
"Gust of wind dance!" I still remember that being a running joke with my friends.
YYYYYEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
0Meh
they are waitinf for you on fri and sat Rarityfan
I love how the character's shout out the attacks when you pull them off.
The more combos, the more awesome it is.
This song is more powerful in person :p
the combos are hard to pull off with the slight delay
A stream doesn't do it justice :p
"Hey guys, let's play dodge ball!" *5 minutes later, hopping around like a spaz* "GUST OF WIND DANCE!"
Yeah, the longer combos were EVIL.
But they were so worth it if you could nail them down consitently.
I'll asmit, I usually just got to the three-combo attacks and just used those
Really wish my hacked PSP still worked so I could play this.D:
That, And parasite eve.
So many "Volcano!" shouts . . .
0The weirdest thing happens. I watch for a couple of days, and then if I stop, the following day is skippy. Then it's all good the following days. This is nerve wracking to say the least.
HARRRRRRPOOOOOOON!
rofl sumica
Speaking of Awesome PS1 RPGs; anyone remember Xenogears?
I have that too
Heard of it, never played it.
looooong game
XENOGEARS
Eghhhhhh
GOD I loved that game.
It's a turn-based JRPG right?
I got so far on luck
Turn based JRPG that utilized button input combos.
I got stuck between a boss and standard enemies, neither of which I could kill
So a lot like LoD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL-_0Yo4ZMQ
There's a link to some gameplay.
Also, it had giant robots.
Hello.
My ONE complaint was that it had what I dub a "BLEEEEEEGH" moment.
Is that that game with the underdressed robot girl?
2 hours of NOTHING but dialogue and storyline sequences.
That could turn her hands into guns?
Nyst: If you mean KOS-MOS, that's Xenosaga. >_>
that is xenosaga
Nyst: That's Xenosaga. I consider Xenosaga the somewhat dumb younger brother of Xenogears.
the 6part game that never was
I loved Xenogears to death. I DEPLORED Xenosaga.
This scene becomes so sad later :(
Which I'm terribly biased against, because nobody knows Xenogears and refers to it as inferior against Xenosaga >_>
xenosaga did make for a nice anime though
9in other news
<.<
(in retrospect that is)
9Xenoblade is grandiose
Well both have Xeno in them >.<
'sup DCD
9and KOS-MOS is pretty awesome in SRW OG Saga
they are the same univers Nyst
Just how many 'Xeno' games are there?
Yeah, that's the problem with Xenosaga.
It should have been an anime, not a game.
it was both Vergil
Yeah, I know.
But the games might as well have just been movies.
-gears -saga -blade, etc; all the same universe?
true
They had MGS4 syndrome.
yeah Nyst
Fight a battle, 30 minute cutscene. 2 battles, 25 more minutes of cutscene.
Etc. Etc.
Yeah.
Hey everypony
It was MGS4 before MGS4.
Hiya Trollight!
Hi TrollightSparkle
Aren't most jrpg's just long linear stories with battles interspersed?
Granted, Xenogears did that too. But at least it was limited to the beginning of disc 2.
9Xenoblade is the best Xeno game so far
9at least according to the gaming press
Yeah, but the linear stories don't happen in huge chunks between sparse battles.
I mean, cut out the combat and you have a movie.
having never played it I disagree =p
9I'm inclined to agree: even while story-heavy, it is much more of a game than the previous attempts
9there's also the fact it could as well be called wRPG: The jRPG
I don't think I've seen xenoblade yet. kinda lost interest after the Saga games.
:| spilt alcohol on my keyboard last night so now i have to use an oldschool white one
9Xenoblade is for the Wii, and it's great
Kinda reminds me of the SaGa series (ie: Romancing Saga).
9pretty much one of the few reasons to own the bloody thing
Got the first game right, failed over and over again trying to reproduce the magic.
Don't get me wrong, I love the story and worldbuilding; but to me it's less then a game if you can't make a decision that changes the way the story unfolds.
9TOO BAD THAT REGGIE IS AN IMBECILE AND WON'T BRING IT STATESIDE, RIGHT GUYS?
Sucks, ctrlx :C
9seriously, fuck Reggie. He's an idiot.
NewDCD, is there a way that i can record the stream of s2 using vlc?
Reggie?
Hey ctrlx, you mean the PS/2 keyboards?!
Nari, i just have to let it dry out for a few days but white one's aren't too bad.
What kind of weird logic is that?
TrollightSparkle, yep
i'm lucky my mobo has a port for it
Aww snap, nostalgiagasm :P
9>They expect it to flunk miserably BECAUSE NOT WAGGLAN
0Wagglan?
9>It actually gets SOLD OUT alllllllllllllll across Europe on the first 48 hours
HI!
PinkieshydashSparkle, you forrgot the applejack
9ladies and gentlemen, NoA. The greatest money haters this side of the globe
.....Oh yes.
^le sigh
no, it just wouldn't fit...
Let's not discuss Mother 3.
That's not town it's .......
*coughcough*
I typed in "pinkyshydashsparklejackity"
9I blame Reggie
well guys i gtg for now
but we shall meet again
9>NEXT UP IN OUR SCHEDULE, RELEASING MORE SHITTY WAGGLAN SHOVELWARE
9I played Disaster
9one of the few games for the Wii I enjoyed
Even better. Several companies wanted to localize Mother 3. But Nintendo refused to give them the rights.
So not only are they too stingy to release Mother 3 themselves, they also refuse to let anyone else.
IS THAT LEGEND OF DRAGOON?
It's like they're holding it HOSTAGE.:/
yep
Umm... I don't mean to intrude on whatever this is, but will bronystate be able to handle the Traffic for season 2, because it seems to be having a little bit of trouble now and there's only 61 people here.
nintendo doesn't seem to think anything not MARIO/ZELDA will ever do well
just to be clear, the premiere is being streamed here on Saturday, right?
I loved that game until my disc decided to stop working. I check PSN for it constantly.
9there are no problems on this end ponYthink
9.....maybe it's your internet connection
9well, if that's the case, you can watch our low-quality stream
9and PinkieshydashSparkle: DAT DA PLAN
NewDCD, is the flash player the only way to watch hte stream?
Zelda? Oh, right. You mean the 'series' that is basically re-releases of Ocarina of time over and over.
Well, I hope that the stream will be able to handle the number of people, anyways.
9ctrlx: if you have an Android mobile phone, Windows Phone, or iPhone you can watch the LQ stream via the uStream app
ocarina of time is best time
9theoretically it should handle unlimited viewers
NewDCD, i'm looking to record it using vlc on my server so that i can have a couple friends watch it off there since they're going to miss the live stream. i tried loading up the source url last night in it but vlc doesn't like rtmp.
Ok, well thank you for answering my questions! And somewhat alleviating some of my fears. /)^3^(\
Gilda the midwife? What an idea..
9ctrlx: you could record the video player itself
9Dman would know about that, he tended to do that a lot back when we were running Veemi
NewDCD, my server is command line only :/
hey everypony, what's up and what are we watching? :D
9ah
9well
9we will be recording the episode I believe
9so uh
yah. might need to find a different stream or find a prog to work
Hello nate, and uh, gameplay of some game I don't know of :P
9you could grab the file from there
NewDCD, where'll it be hosted?
good times :)
It's Legend of Dragoon.
that actually sounds like a better idea
Huh.
9no clue yet. Probably Megaupload.
Back
OMG, epic scene coming up.
NewDCD, cool beans
Wait, now I'm confused. Is season 1 airing at 7 Pm EST, or Blade Runner?
both
at the same time
nah idk
Neat trick.
So..
A stream within a stream?
:D
i heard you like streams
9don't go Streamception on me
Well that soldier didn't take much convincing . . .
9that's already happened here
9and ironically it happened with Inception
Wow, seriously?
9I had to stream a stream of Inception
SILVERMANE!
Sandora >>>>>>>> Basil
Yo dawg, I herd u liek streams?
9cause my download fucked up
this boss hax
The illusions suck -_-
Good luck :<
This game looks interesting.
So is the pre-show essentially just playing requests for five hours tomorrow?
Hey everypony!
Hi Jen
?
Ohai Silvermane
What're we watching, currently?
Legend of Dragoon
fighting
Legend of Dragoon.
I like a Dart/Rose/Kongol setup. Dart is average, Rose is weak against physical and Kongol is weak against magic.
SPINNING CANE! VOLCANO!
whatcha need ReticentSmolder?
HARRRRRRPOOOOOOOON!
GUST OF WIND-DANCE!
Blossom Storm!
feh another boss
BLAZING DYNAMO!!!
y u no chat SilverMane?
/me appears
How would that even work today? Shouting 'TRIGGERPULL BULLETSHOOT'?
Is this Legend of Dragoon?
yea
11yep
This is totally Legend of Dragoon.
Blazing Dynamo is the name for Dart's highest addition. It's just a bunch of sword strikes.
:D
Nah. Due to the popularity of anime nowadaze, it'd be all in Japanese, Nyst.
oh right cant fail combos on this one
Ah yeah; or some faux-latin sounding stuff
Dead
Curses
lol
Tougher than I thought they were.
You seem disappointed
Hiya Grim!
Ahoy!
Lavitz dead
howdy
D&P going on? I went to see a movie and just got back :O
D&P?
We're doing... stuff.
The damage of attacks is directly related to how cool they look.
#bronystate_d&p
Hardest additions in the games for me were the Dragoon physical attacks.
I hate that little eyeball charger.
Kongol smash
no dynamic kill for you Dart.
Let's have a think here
And this is where the game gets difficult
I found a ringpop and some taffy :3
If there was a pony JRPG, how would you handle combat so it was kidfriendly/safe (so no violence), yet still challenging gameplay wise?
finaly
This is indeed where the game started kicking my ass the first time I played
What IS D&P?
Nyst, what would have to change in the gameplay to make it kid friendly?
D:
OH CRAP BRING THE WEAPONS BACK
Vergil, last I remembered, it's an impromptu game of D&D.. I think :P
Well basically it can't have blood, death etc.
You don't even have those in boy cartoons
Fighting is Magic is doing a fairly good job I think, when it comes to those standards.
mmyeah
Dem counters
though there's no way that game would exist anywhere else then here.
On a side note, this boss fight looks so.. unfair
He counters you if you mess up your combo
You have to get the timing right.
look at kid cartoons these days. Very often there are no weapons, just fighting via proxy; with the hero always being the defencer/the one to prove himself.
Or else.
If THIS is considered a 'hard boss fight' I shudder to think what you'd think of a Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne boss fight.
No, it's just where the game gets somewhat challenging Vergil
Is the stream fucked for everyone else?
hmm, okay I have it some thought, and a pony game could work where there is literally no physical contact
Damn. Dead island is cruel. I went to start the game, and went to get something to eat while the game was loading.
omg this game? i still have it!
SMT is highly regarded for its soul crushing difficulty.
Dash could just spin you dizzy, AJ could buck a tree and drop apples on your head, things like that
Dat unlock boss fight.
Ooh big scene coming up
HAHA, SMT BOSS FIGHTS
Game plops me into a zombie horde before I get back to my PC.
4 discs of awesome
So how does SMT compare to Demons Souls?
05old games always makes me happy isnide
No kill like overkill.
Two different games, Seb.
In terms of difficulty.
Imagine if they did a rerelease of this with updated graphics
I'd say it's on par.
FFFFFFFFFFFu game let me save already
I drool over thoughts like that DreezeFrame
Vergil, how about Etrian Odyssey?
they need to rereleas this on bluray
Often times just to clear a boss you need to go do a bunch of fusions to get a monster, then level it up enough to fight the boss....
9Dart transformed into Spike
Dart is cooler than Spike
Just so at least ONE member of your party can survive the inevitable 'instakill all' spell the boss uses.
this makes me want to go and continue where i left off, on disc 3
Who is the chick with only one sock?
Rose
Etrian is NOTHING compared to SMT.
That much I can say for certain. I was on the QA team for Etrian.
She's over 10K years old.
it pissed me off when Lavitz died
Meh, I prefer Albert over Lavitz.
Damnit, could you at least give out a spoiler alert..?
well albert just seemed like a noob, where lavitz gave that pro feel
>_>
Nah, it's cool.. but I really was considering searching for this game..
lol spoiler of a game thats older than god knows what
Predestination stuff. Staple of rpg's
Snape kills dumbledore!
D:
i have this game
FFFFFFFFFF
who wants to buy it from me
Too bad I've already read the books! :D
Vader is Luke's father!
Howdy everypony!
got to dig this out of my closet and play it someday
Why hai there
Soylent Green is People!
You still around DCD?
Wow, thanks for spoiling it for me >:(
Han shoots first
Any others I missed?
SuperBrony64!
TrollightSparkle!
Peater Parker is Spiderman!
/me wishes a big welcome to all the newcomers
/me brohoofus maximus
Someone NEEDS to do that fan picture.
Peter Parker's uncle died
hi everybody
Rainbow Dash, Dressed as Charlton Heston.
NO
ITS EVERYPONY GOD DAMIT
mib_ihuk3h: LALALA NOT LISTENING
So many people joining.. I'm just gonna say hi to all the people that are joining.
Yelling "The cupcakes are made out of PONIES! IT'S POOOOONNIEES!"
Spoiler for Passion: Jesus gets crucified!
NOT FUCKING "EVERYBODY" ITS EVERYPONY GOD DAMIT *Ghost rage, beer cans flying everywhere*
Hmm…is there anything special about Thursday night? Seems like a lot of people are on right now...
13­
0equestria daily just did a plug for bronystate
Dunno
I cannot bring myself to use the term everyp
Did they really?
idk, but did you ponies see the interview with lauren faust on EqD?
See? My English Gland stopped me.
0yeah, i saw it
0why is mine yellow
Didn't, cause I don't check EqD that often.
0i just came here for the first time
I see...
­
check it now dude
­
­
I have this gland in my brain that inflates whenever someone does something terrible to the English language.
hi shutterfly
Is it just me or is Wilkin not saying anything?
If it gets too big, it'll explode and I'll die.
9gonna take over for a little while
0is it yellow to indicate text you've personally entered?
So I can't use the term everyp
Yes, I am pretty shy-
Get a English Glandectomy, duh.
­
DCD is gonna take over for a few. give my arm a break.
I tried to play Borderlands the other day.
then you can say all the fun brony terms without a problem
After about the 15th 'Pis off' sign, I passed out.
Vergil, Borderlands is hilarious
*sigh* I think I failed my Organic Chemistry quiz :/
Least, I think so ;_;
0its a good game
Borderlands is amazing. :D
ok bye everypony!
0cya
Bye!
Bye mib'
cio
Bye anon.. or mib.. or.. I dunno ;_;
Not because I have no survival skills, but because the blatant misspellings everywhere would kill me.
0is the stream over or is my internet derping?
Later days, mib!
It's over for the moment, I think./
0alright
I think they may be switching.
Not sure.
From Equestria Daily "BronyState is having a movie night tomorrow in honor of season two…" Do they really not know anything about BronyState?
*shrug*
NewDCD, has somthing to show you all.
0I think bronystate is a pretty cool guy, eh shows season 2 online and doesn't afraid of anything
YAY SEASON TWO!!! i think i'm going to have a heart attack
UGH. G1 pony movie.
Really? Show us NewDCD!
Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World are awesome jrpg parodies.
I'm SCARED, sarge!
No wai. We're actually watching G1 tomorrow?
G1 movie yes
A Movie is Bladerunner.
The bunkers. Head to them. NOW
it's the B movie
TrollightSparkle: Yeah, My Little Pony The Movie from the 80s
The B-movie is "My Little Pony: The Movie".
:D
0 80s XD
A movie is blade runner
80's explains it all to me XD
I'm gonna need a LOT more alcohol....
0blade runner is a movie
tomorrow is going to be sweeeet

EWWW ME
Mac OS X!

Windows 95 XD
... ok why is it not loading for me.
0Is DCD streaming now?
Better yet, DOS
try refreshing
ah there we go
Minix!
95, i want to watch it crash
WinXP SP-3 is my votw
FreeBSD!
vote
0shield boomerang? what
and Celestia said " Let there be giant mechs."
win7
SUDDENLY SPANISH
0wait is that spanish wikipedia about math
MATHS!
Wait, I just had to AFK. What is this again?
HAHAHA
Mediana?
0suddenly math, thousands of them
Ubuntu!
9sorry, I might have to minimize sometimes without previous notice
someone forgot to do their homework
9due to personal reasons
0alright
9okay
9uhhh
9guess I'll use XP Service Pack 3
9because I like bigass swords for our test pilot
I think we can all agree on Windows 95 :P
no, use FreeBSD
0how is this game even possible
I didn't know Snails was a pilot...
LETS ROCK
Should I try to play Half-Life before Half-Life 2? (tried it before but I can't get the long jump to work.)
the same way MUGEN is possible
Oh. It turns Operating Systems into Mecha?
Alright, this looks badass. How do I get it?
it's a Gundam!
OH NO, IT'S SNAIL!!!! RUN FOR THE HILLS EVERYPONY!!!!!!
Try a Somersault!
Dynasty Warriors? :o
In B4 Windows 98 SE is a cardboard box with a tin can glued on.
Use the boost to chase!
Use Bombs wisely!
0do a barrel roll
ARRRRRRRwing
Do a barrel roll
Slippy, get back here!
0go i actually played the game those are from
0last weekend
0my friend still has his 64 and starfox
0and pokemon stadium XD
oh hi invisable walls
So…this is My Little Pony?!
I can't let you do that, Star Fox
:P
Snails vs Snails. It's the end of the word as we know it
MLP: Mechs are awsome
They certainly have changed it since G3.5
0Mechs are magic
Alright, we're heading to Aquas-tria
who needs magic when you have a gaint mech
0My little Gundam: laser swords are magic
Fluttershy's ship is in the docking bay.
lol
Cthulu Tech players do
needs more macross missle mayhem
Dark_Heart: or you could have Ideon.
=x
Maintenance on Rainbow Dash's ship is complete.
0is there a way to set afk?
Ultimate power + Mecha = destroy EVERY THING!
0and are the chatnames remembered?
Location confirmed, sending supplies
"/away"?
idle for 10 min
0ok cool
0god ive played minecraft online
0i probably should have tried that
lauch the cutie mark crusaders
Fire the chickengun
You must construct additional pylons
UNLEASH NIGHTMARE
Why u no ZZ Gundam?
This makes me wanna armored core
Armored core is like this?
the hell was taht a nonoha spell?
Believe it
I don't believe
Was thinking of puting AC2 on after dcd is done.
0additional supply depots are needed
More lumber is required
0wololo
Armored Core is more realistic. This is an awesome robot battle
This reminds me of Tenkaichi
Giant laser swords and fast dashing and whatnot.
The perspective, anyway
I learned a new way to say hi *slashs with sword* HI
it's a PINCHA!
Well, technically Gundam = first real robot series
0so are these just streams of emulators?
That's pretty questionable
0for this at least
0mfw, the red thing looks like a pony
I can't find any Nueue Ziel downloads for Bootfighter.:<
Disappoint.
Considering that the first Mobile Suit Gundam was in space
This is more like G Gundam
Send in the Crisis suit team
Also, the environments need work
For the Tau
in 2021 the OS wars began.
0wait why won't the high quality stream work
Actually, SEED was an attempt at a reboot of the original Gundam series.
when will season 2 start? iam on the pacific coast of canada so the time change is confusing
OH GOD WHY DID YOU MENTION THAT?
hey, another canadian
But not all of Mobile Suit Gundam was in outerspace.
every one loves SEED
Sumica: no
No
Season 2 starts at 6 AM PST
No
No
0so wait how is the live stream working
ya
Who knows
Shutterfly: You mean right now?
0no
oh right you are new with us Pontang. it's a bit of a running joke.
0i think its working via internet right now
0i mean chronologically
0tomorrow
Around 15 episodes of MSG took place on Earth.
0PST for me
Sumica: =3
windows black is kicking arse
0is there a windows ME?
thanks
Right after the movies end, there will be a Season 1 marathon which one of the streamers will stream from their computer.
OH YES I LIKE THE SOUDN OF THAT!
9that was Bootfighter Windom
9it's a free game
After that, the stream will switch to someone with a capture card on their computer and play The Hub live.
nice game DCD
9you can get it from here
0okay cool
who's streaming?
anyone read the fallout equestria fanfic?
dat desktop
NewDCD: Looks cool, but I'm sure it doesn't run on Mac :/
why is hub no streaming D:
9http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7XQ6T32Z
0also i have the vague feeling that's questionably legal
9beecause
9copyright bullshit
DCD you streaming
0is okay with this
9so we won't stream the Hub till it's time to stream the Hub
Because then that would be logical and they would lose viewers on TV.
9aka: the pony episodes
0no i mean
9anyways gonna switch to SRW
0lol i just meant streaming it at all
PONY VIDEOS :)
0seemed questionable
unless you wantto watch happy days cause that's what is on hub right now.
0not that its any of my concern
TV studios only know of who's watching based on how many people are watching their channel on TV.
NewDCD where did you get SRW from?
0i wonder if
0dvr'ing a show
0still counts as a view
0because in order to dvr it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNgg_8wfbF0&list=FL886Wj90ltvsyzkPhGylHqQ&feature=plpp
epic pony pmv
9Revolver: I patched SRW J myself
0it need stream the cable information
Shutterfly, It does because the box has to tune it to the channel in order to watch it.
0it probably still counts
0yeah exactly
it's ok Shutterfly I am part of a nealsion family I count as 500k people when i watch a show.
But I don't have a cable box (nor cable :P), so I'm just going to get it as a Season pass on iTunes.
0how do you directly address a person, as in the bolded coloring
0is it
0@ or #?
0oh
By just typing their name.
0oh okay
type a bit of the name then hit tab Shutterfly
See, Shutterfly
0what does the hash tag do?
0i was wondering how you were typing such a counterintuative name so efficiently
Oh wow, did not know the tab shortcut :P
^_^
9we're live again
Hurray for being Live!
Ban-presto? lol
0this is the most haphazard stream ever
0i like it
Now what are we watching?
0me gusta face
SRW
I see.
FUCK YEAH, SPIKE.
Super robot wars
0lol manticore
Broadcast is offline
I see you set the attack names.
9check out my sweet ride, guys
0whats up with the 'high quality stream popout'?
use http://bronystate.net/theatre/
0it doesnt seem to lad
Broadcast is online, try and refresh the page mib_sf4yw0
0load
9Shutterfly: that's our old HQ player. We haven't been able to change it yet
0oh alright
Awwwwww yeaaaaaa
what am i watching?
refreshed twice, broadcast is offline
Super robot wars
Super Robot Wars
0also is this site hosted in canada or something
0cause of the theatre
^lolwhat
You mean based off of the spelling Shutterfly ?
0is the anglican spelling
0yeah
0and the show is animated in canada
9actually
0seems logical
i never knew there was a dif spelling (derp iam canadian)
9Dari is british
9and he's our code junkie
0you mean web design guru?
Dari probably derped when making it =p
0XD
Uh-oh! That means I'm connecting long distance over the internet!
9no no, the stream is hosted in another server
9so yeah
0uribatake looks like a trollface
9Uribatake
Haha :P
He has the face of an asshole.
9Y u want to hit on the CMC?
problem, Shutterfly =p
Someone is hitting on CMC?
0yes, problem, his chin is jutting out of his face for like 5 inches
^
hes the son of j leno probably
0also another question, is the name remembered via IP or something?
0or you just keep entering it when you come back
Uh-oh, enemy attack!
We need the power of the Mane 6!
Some one set up us the bomb
we get signal
0lol they just put a weird screen animation over the regular sprites
0main screen turn on
Depends on how you connect Shutterfly
hello gentlecolts
0all your base are belong to us
Hello, how are you gentlemen?
wait, is this super robot wars?
a stand alone irc will keep it in.
0oh god the gentlemen meme has ruined that word for me
all your bros are belong to us
All your base are belong to us.
NINJA'D!
Sucks to be you.
+200 Points
0wait theres a standalone version of then?
0this
Yes Seviper
stand alone chat yes Shutterfly it's just IRC.
the stream requires a site.
0oh yeah i remember now
0internet relay whatever
how long until some season 1 marathon?
You can use an IRC client to access this chat. (Windows: mIRC Mac: Colloquy)
Season 1 is after Movie Night
0ugh gtg
Movie night starts at 7 PM EST tomorrow.
Thought mIRC only had a trial version then you had to pay SuperBrony64?
Bye Shutterfly!
but some browsers will remember what you type in to a data field such as login names.
Night Shutterfly.
/me hugs Shutterfly goodnight
Bye Shutterfly!
Dont have to pay but after 30days it has a load time on start up TrollightSparkle
TrollightSparkle, well, even if that's the case, you can still use it as an IRC client no? :P
This is true..
so at about 8 or 9 am tomorrow for me?
I'm stupid, please ignore me sometimes. :/
So, I never really got into Super Robot wars.
How does one become a pony?
I'm not familiar as to what the best IRC client is on Windows (been using Macs for the longest time now), but I do recommend Colloquy if you have a Mac.
Is it like, some giant crossover or something?
not stupid, just missinformed.
....wow i have not used that line sence i stopped GMing for eve.
Hmm
mib_ppq0g9: Depends where you live.
You not in the United States?
/me is now a pony.
Now afk time, I guess.
but the marathon is before seaosn 2 ep 1 right?
yes Anon
Going to bed. Bye everyone
Yes, Season 1 is up until Season 2 starts (6 AM PST)
Night, Dash
6am tomorrow?
i don't wanna goto work tomorrow ;-;
saterday the 17th
6am saturday?
9and then
pst yes
9MOOD WHIPLASH
I estimate that Season 1 Marathon will start around 8:30 PM - 9:00 PM EST, depending on when MLP The Movie ends and if there's an intermission.
mlp the movie?
So S2 starts 6AM EST in the US, correct?
That's the second movie of the night tomorrow
yes Anon the 1980's one
6 AM PST
9 AM EST
9am est
Damnit, hard choice between sleep and ponies :P
so seaosn 1 marathon not happening tonight or anytime soon?
Well, if you stay up for Marathon, you'll have a good incentive to stay up haha.
might try and run the sunday showing of ep 201 as well
but that's even earlyer >_<
Well yeah, but I can't really stay up late late anymore.. getting myself adjusted for the beginning of the school year :/
so season 1 marathon is tomrrow?
you are around one day to early anon
oh okay
Yes, Season 1 is tomorrow.
Tonight is just…Super Robot Wars :P
super brobot wars
But Anon.
Pull up a chair, join us. http://www.ponychan.net/chan/dis/src/131474126132.png
A lot of people are here because of that notice on Equestria Daily haha
stop, collaborate
oh yeah and I'm back
Welcome back!
ok whoa i have no idea what's going on now
Giant robot mixup
So mucgh Pony
Super Robot Wars…but I think you were here when he started it?
So much Pony.
yeah but
only during the unduly long intro
not actual fighting
Yeah, this is the start of the game lol
So, wait. Which SRW title is this?
It took awhile for the game to actually start.
she's a brit?
lol guv.nah
9naw
9she's just madmax: Real Robot Pilot Edition
9also the game freezes when I type
9so don't worry
Anyone know exactly WHICH SRW title this is?
probably one of them with SRW in the name
9SRW J
There's so many in the wiki, I can't figure which this is.D:
Never actually heard of the game until DCD started playing it haha
what platform was this for originally?
I wanna guess either Playstation or Dreamcast...
But could have been originally on PC
9series started on the GB
9now it's on basically every console except PC
Man I realy want to show some gunbuster now.
whoa yeah
This one looks to have been on the GBA
i just looked at the wikipedia which has its own article
on SRW titles by platform
it's spike
wait what cellular phone
Cellular Phone?
yes if you count Nokia's talkie taco.
there was an srw game
for some sort of phone apparently?
the Ngadge
aka the talkie taco
okay
Haha, you mean the N-Gage?
yeah
0So, Sumica, are you planning on recording the season two premiere?
wait i just looked it up, wtf is this ngage thing
how could they possibly think that was a good idea
it was some crappy gameing/phone thing
ll
But failed horribly.
very
have tryed to record but would have to use two programs to get a good quality image that is't interlaced.
see: gameboy micro
i remember it being in gamestop
for failed handhelds
Shutterfly, they had dreams of something like the PSP phone thingy, except they sucked at implementation
Sucked so very hard.
I would rather give you all a better stream for the live and get a rip of it later on.
inb4sexualreference
Problem was 1.) It cost about $300, which was crazy for a portable game system
they are showing ep 201 6 times between saterday and monday.
i dont think anyone would have said "thats what she said"
and i agree with Sumica on the stream
so plenty of time to grab it.
massive army of bots
2.) The graphics/games
weren't spectacular enough to draw in any real attention
lol big blast
*rocket fires from awkward location*
Plus you needed a cell phone plan to use it, which left out the market of young gamers from using it (which was a major audience for portable game systems)
you should see the punch to the moon Shutterfly
hey gall_ could you make up ur mind with ut name
Hi
Howdy Jigglysaint
trainguy, just in case.
use the beam of war on it
GRAVITY BLAST FIRE! *:D*
seemed like a bit overkill
there is no overkill, only open fire and i have to reload.
So the live stream of season 2 is here then?
yes Jigglysaint
Yes, but not today.
What time is it supposed to be on at?
6am pst 9am est
i think it was ten?
okay
oh, 9
6 AM PST, which is right after the Season 1 Marathon, which is right after the Movie Night
oh geez 6 Am pst?
Yeah
yeah
man thats going to be hard waking up...I really destroy my interal clock
I'm on EST
and im in est
also what that means the movie night
is like
still means I have to get up early
at 1 AM
Just watch the entire Season 1 Marathon to keep you awake lol
that might work
I wish
some things are just worth staying up for
well I'll keep the computer on
pray all to Celestia and luna i dont sleep in (like i could even sleep the night before)
or waking up for
agree'd
though if I camp out in the stream I might crash firefoxx
why?
it happened once
computer ran out of memory
i was thinking of camping too...
chrome is the unstable one
oh is that all?
9suddenly
and i use firefox, so i guess im good
How much memory you running?
9MANSPIKE ATTACK
no clue
>_>
-_-
uh
try typing
lol DCD
'system'
into the start menu search bar
gem romancer
You could right click "My Computer" and click "Properties " to find out.
Hell yes, Gem Romancer
i lol'd
well it's an older computer
then click system
i like how spike uses gems
and it will say how much
yeah
Right click "My Computer" then Jigglysaint
it's pretty perfect
god dis game
But if it's really eating up memory, just use Chrome. It uses the least amount of memory I believe.
lol no it doesn't
i believe he said he was using chrome
SuperBrony64: it uses the least for say 1 tab
What uses the least amount of memory then?
but it threads
*each* tab
hell i cant even tell anymore
9oh hey
hexacores and 8 gigs of memory does that to you
9Spike learned Combo L1
lol
lol i have 4 gigs ddr3 its not a problem for me
well it says the virtual memory is about 720 megs
like I said, old computer
except when exceeding like 100 chrome tabs
lol
Same here Shutterfly
Hot damn.
i havent tried 100 tabs yet
But I use FF
well thats your GPU memory Jigglysaint
but the kmost ive done was pretty big,a nd it was fine, even reloading all of them at once
aka graphics card
ah
but with
TEAMWORK
that much gpu memory
it could be only maybe 3 years old
If you just right click "My Computer" and click "Properties" it will show up underneath the computer info
or just my computer
That's actually just the virtual memory that the computer allocates.
it should be on the bottom bar
oh wait
of course, the best way to remember ur computer stats is to put the memory and hardware in urself
did he say
crap
i accidentally my browser
i can resite my specs by heart
lol so can I
well anyway, I can try camping out
im using a laptop though
there we go
the whole thing awolfers?
mind you I won't be able to sleep anyway
huge ass tower for me =D my favorite
and modding a laptop is a pain
yeah
compared to a desktop
too much of a pain
My computer uses an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 Ghz, 2 GB RAM, GeForce 8600 GT w/ 256 MB, etc.
i have expanded ram though
then when my girlfriend calls and I have to explain why I ddin't sleep all night
that I was up watching ponies
Well even if you lock up you can come back in Jigglysaint
Still kickin'
for me, i tgot the largest motherboard physcially possible XD
and im happy
yeah
though it will be a zoo I'm sure
yep
yeah
well focus ont he movie instead of the chat then

Haha what the heck game is this?
There's a lottery every week to determine the next movie's for Movie Night.
Hey!
This week, the lottery is on Saturday during the encore performance.
MFW I havent even seen that news letter yet.
This game looks interesting
Super Robot Wars J?
I think.
Natleyn: Yes
Hello everyone, how are you doing?
great
Pretty good, how are you IrOnLoRe
Pretty good
happy
has anybody here heard of the Nostalgia Crittic and That Guy With The Glasses?
im doing good to
yeah i have jiggly
Somewhat distracted by the exploding robots
Oh, nevermind. I don't care for strategy games... (I suck at them)
ah
Yeah Jigglysaint
is it okay to post links here?
I've heard of the Nostalgia Critic. Never watch him though.
i think
ah
wait hmm this mirc costs _money_
Should be fine, just not during movie night I believe.
im not to fond of that whole site though
No it doesn't
No Shutterfly
Fluttershy FTW!
http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/ask-thatguy/32441-episode-63?comment_id=558733#josc558733
its only a 30 day trial
Hello everyone. I have Jigglysaint.
I love the Nostalgia Chick's review of the MLP movie! XD
If you just idle for a bit, continue becomes clickable
oh
i dont know why, but they kinda get on my nerves soemtimes
it has to do with MLP
after trial time you just have to wait 30 secons to load it up
oh
why even do that
whats the point
well ever since some weird bronies attacked Lupa's review
to anoy you in to buying
i guess
what do you mean attacked
its not very effective
it doesnt sound very brony-ish
it's like that popup on winraw
lol
lol
perfect.
XD
i hate those programs that use like a screen wide frame
well one of the reviewrs, Obscureous Lupa did a reivew of The Princess Prominade
but did not mention G4
Oh no?
doesnt sioudn that terrible
so some bronies got mad and asked why she didn't mention them
So what?
Dang DCD, you're flying through these menus
this caused Linkara and Spoony to jump to her defense
Good for them! I like those two
9I know my SRW menus by heart
Haha
9how do you think I can play the Japanese-only games like Z2=
I should hope so.
…You understand Japanese?
i just thought you knew japanese?
HAH PERFECT
Nah.
ninja'd
wow thats some intense muscle memory
Who likes fluttershy?
I started playing that a few weeks back NewDCD
9I know SRW-ese
ME!
9recognize the Hiragana a bit
MUTANTPANDA521: me
Fluttershy is the best pony, duh.
9know what commands make you fly and such
SuperBrony64: brohoof
9the menus ain't so hard
I like pinkie pie more =D
/me brohoofs Shutterfly back
I know the romanji so much more than I do any characters
It's a three-way between Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Fluttershy
pinkie pie is my second favorite
tie, a 3 way tie
god
good catch there
jiggly, ponies and three way should not be in the same sentence
FIRE NUKES
suddely homework.
What kind?
I mean 3 way tie for favorite pony
thats a bit better XD
Oh favorite pony now?
I like Pinkie, Flutter, Dash and Rarity... I could take or leave AJ and Twilight
Twilight pony. Nuff said.
I wonder what your favorite pony is TrollightSparkle...
XD
it's fluttershy
dont be fooled
Rainbow Dash always dresses in style
=/
nah she likes nix
I like twilit spackle!
I like Twilight Sparkle as well, I think she definitely is up there next to Fluttershy
you mean, she wears ntohign at all?
I like all the ponies (except Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara)
pfft its all about vinyal
boxy
i im tied between twilight + fluttershy
So, i guess i should say I'm kinda, new to the brony thing. I only recently, watched the whole entire first series an i must say, it's really good. lol
tilit spackle spiderses!!
So tough to make decisions >_<
also it should be canon that Sweetie Belle's parents, and by extention, Rarity's, are two rainbows
I do prefer Rarity and Cheerilee, though.
stupid sexy rainbow dash
1980's cheerilee
pinkie pie has some good songs though...
IrOnLoRe: in agreement.
DCD is trying to look likes he's doing homework instead of gameing =p
IrOnLoRe: Glad you like it, now you'll get the chance to pass your initiation, which is the Season 1 marathon.
wait y u browse in spanish
who cares
or
Check the get to know us page Shutterfly
maybe it's cause his mother cant read it

http://bronystate.net/about/

SuperBrony64: i wonder how many people will _complain_ about the intermissions
9yeah mom came into room
