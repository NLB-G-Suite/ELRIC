Twilight, Fluttershy and Rarity are my three favorites
Twilight is mai waifu, Fluttershy preys on my protective instincts, and Rarity is the most entertaining when she loses her mind.
Is it pony time yet?
Let me check.
Yeah, definitely.

>mi cara cuando you can't see mi cara cuando

Yup

I didn't read it, because I like to avoid nightmares
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOVDu7etQlc <-- hmmmmm
That song needs to be extended. Such an awesome and catchy song that lasts only 25 seconds
and i'm out
good night guys
Good night then
Oh hai Nittany
Hi.
rain? rain?
it doesn't rain here.
only vodka
Eh, not really.
The cores of them are going to slip SE of me, though.
Wow, I actually like storms.
Same here.
That and the power too
I like storms too.
Wow, it was amazing.
I continuously captured pictures with my camera in hopes that I would capture something at the right moment.
Got a lot of good pictures that night.
Do you have an SLR with variable exposure?
No, but I had an iPhone 4 >_<
Lol.
I got some amazing pictures with the camera.
Even with the right camera, it's tricky.
It helped being able to continuously capture photos
Or something.
But I would pick up nothing.
Haha nice!
Yeah.
Those were very lightning-active storms.
Later.
Here's one of my images I took that night
http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/189/photo1rif.jpg/
Wow.
Did it work?
Yeah.
http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/25/epiclightningwatermarke.jpg - Kansas City.
Actually, to be honest, I don't even think that was an iPhone 4 haha
I think it was my old iPhone 3G
Oh darn
That's
That's definitely not an iPhone camera lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXhSuOmIpSo
Well, that was a scary song.
Anyway, that was a nice pic.
Thanks, yours as well.
But it was definitely a night to remember.
Hopefully I'll get to see it again, but it's been a while since then.
Yeah.
The constant thunder was putting pressure on my eardrums.
I had to pull myself away from the action and get inside.
And no stream... Oh, well...
Oh, I just KNOW that's going to WRECK me.
Haha, I have to go to the store to pick up some Rockstar/Red Bulls for that night.
At my age... ow, that's going to wreck me...
Well, as long as you don't have school/work on Saturday, just sleep during that day haha
I plan on staying up all night and then just crashing as soon as the premiere for Season 2 ends
Never too old for Ponies haha.
Otherwise that statement wouldn't make any sense...
However, in my apartment, with Netflix and Hulu, I haven't found the need for cable
This has been my critical point
She definitely has yet to let anyone down
Or close to it.
I'm the exact opposite.
I don't think I've watched TV (cable, not including internet) once for a couple of weeks now
I live off of Netflix and Hulu
no i watched the latest marble hornets
the latest one
?
Are they an insect?
no its just the name of a web series
film*
Oh okay.

lawl
that many clones
but yeah it's annoying
i don't like touching my mouse either though.. too much work
work that i otherwise don't need to do
lol yeah, had to do it when Val became a mod, before he had a background color
0So why was I the only one you had to hover over? o.o
0Everyone's white-on-black for me
interesting but understandable
Well, ponies.
You can't explain that.
0Ponies OuO
Ponies come in, ponies go out
never a miscommunication
i was on /b/ looking for something entertaining like FBF or something but found that instead
i never go on /b/ except when i do
http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pokmon-overkill1.jpg
i have pictures on the PS3 saved with those times
Not me. But I do like ponies.
eh can't REALLY help not hearing about something
I haven't been on 4chan much lately
ya i don't like the place despite having gone there sometimes.. and i still go there alot less now.. i guess it's cause i have much more entertaining things to do elsewhere now
0Like ponies? :D
yes lol
dat cultural difference
yep
0Nope
._____.
duuude
uhm
xD
yesterday night i felt asleep
alright lol
:D
but it's apparently the demographic says different
woah nm.. maybe it's just the manga
and generally ALL THE TIME
0...You win this round.
lol
0Seems like it's about time for me to get some sleep. Brb, need to catch a cat ^_^
grab him by the rainbow and pull him to you
/me 0has obtained one cat.
i smell a money making idea
0Alarm clocks that inflict physical pain until they're sure you're awake? :D
lol yes
0http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/lights/8f1a/
0I think that'll do the trick :D
i am unfamiliar with that model
also FF victory music is awesome:D

A friend of mine was trying to get me to watch it
Actually
Hello Fluttershy
and they're in production of a movie to finish off the series
sleep?
Mmm. Maybe I'll get around to watching more than the opening then
lol
Are you going to sleep through Celestia's beautiful day? ...she might grow resentful, y'know
I like how they approach the time travel theory

Hello DecapKnight
really?
Yah
thats pretty sad
Or at least first to verbally acknowledge
Those games are pretty good, although first one is pretty dated.
DecapKing?
i am on bronychat
I've ever fucking seen
Yeah, at least last night they changed IRC again to irc://irc.ponychat.net/bronystate
wat?
Whoa
that's a lot of GGgala_s
Yeah, it's somewhat random really...
yup
srsly
stoppit
i'm going to work
That too...
later, guys!
Brb MAG
I think he just has a terrible connection
that doesn't explain 4 different connections
and ghosting the old one
well, he is using chatzill && xchat
>chatzilla
ye
that would be a mess :/
should probably just
stick with xchat or something
kvirc's p good
a terminal based irc user!
/me is slowly switching to terminal based programs
if i went to sleep now i hope i would be wide awake for the season 2 stream and the immediate aftermath
gotta fix my sleep schedule around what's important
yeah, I've heard good things about both
there's aspell support built into weechat
well my third day out of school this week
>__>
but I also like the python scripting support

not that it matters a whole lot to me, I don't really know perl or python -.-

I could probably edit minor amounts of code just fine, but not create without looking at lots of documentation

yup
eeeeeeyup
and dat fluttershy head
not that any of that helps, since I haven't coded in any of those languages
but at least it would give options later when I eventually pick up a scripting language
time to install UDK
UDK?
also
http://www.weechat.org/scripts/
164 scripts, quite a few
I have a script for xchat that does something similar to highmon
I thought you already installed it
nah
I just downloaded it
i forgot about installing it
Ohh, yeah I hear it's good
that was used in multiple games
also uh
bronychat
coo

I'm using the same Luna wallpaper as Sathi

http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/2007/mcdpinkiepieremovedlogo.png

Oooh, I like it
I kinda prefer having pony wallpapers, but sometimes it's tempting to switch for a while :P

9also
Shinn was good.
9they basically rewrote the plot for these games
need Megas

9SON.
9I AM PROUD.
awesome, all shinji needed was some manly rolemodels.
9oh, and that was actually written by Hideaki Anno for SRW
9so it's sorta canon
...naw
9and Ryoma is the Getter's main pilot
As in, if Shinji had manly role models he'd actually be able to man up?
9this is the Getter
9pretty much
9and felt unwanted
9then people want him to pilot the Evas and he doesn't have a say on it, and he doesn't want to
9he wants to help those people
9cue him fucking shit up with a robot-sized katana
Not a chain-sword?
9here

I lost track of how many times all the planets had been destroyed
9for these guys
9this is just another Tuesday
Gered's voice is kind annoying.
9but he's best pilot
=s
To be honest, I loved Uso's piloting tactics.
Garrod*
But I'm a huge Victory Gundam fanboy.

I heard of that.
9as in, piloteable mech
9powered by Diesel

9the Kuratas...it's basically a real Armored Trooper
9he might also be hinting on going commercial with those mechs

Then you are fucked
At which hour does the stream start?
On Saturday, you mean?
k how about for season 2?
yes saturday
I think it's 9AM eastern
The episode airs at 9 AM eastern.
9AM EST
2 PM GMT
i live in Europe =)
uhm
no
GMT cares not for daylight savings.
it's 2pm
OH!
3PM Central European Time
yes
wait, is he?
then it's 2PM CET I guess...
....no I'm pretty sure it's 2PM GMT
http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/
CET is EST+6
GMT is EST+5
It is currently 5:43 PM GMT
it is currently 6:43
GMT
i live in GMT+1
Yes, but we aren't /on/ EST. Us East Coast USA people are on Eastern /Daylight/ Time.
here is 7:43
uhm
i'm not getting it
EST: GMT -5.
EDT: GMT -4
Oh okay
kaaaay
lolwait, no...
RP:
its 1pm in NYC
Pinkie.
More like 1:45
Europe / UK clocks are on Summer Time
IE, GMT +1.
FUCK YOU CONFUSING TIME ZONES!
lol okay
DecapKing: I blame Daylight Savings.
we need STANDARDS
We /do/ have a standard. It's called GMT.
Greenwich Mean Time.
well its harder here in the Midwest when you are a farmer
Pardon?
Well perhaps when farmers needed the extra Daylight hours
Hmmm. They're on EDT, ie GMT-4.
they do
cause they still bitch about it
Daylight Savings was a wartime measure for factory workers and such.
Sad
Luckily multiple endings
the time on the clock has noting to do with when the sun comes up
from MI east
right now?
Right now, yes
which states are not on EDT
I don't know any US states that ignore the whole daylight savings nonsense.
At least on the East Coast.
I give up on this conversation
all US states follow it
derp
/me now feels slightly down...
That's kind of confusing then, to list times for EST, isn't it?
montana?
Espy: Indiana used to
You talking about time zones?
Hello Pinkie
Arizona and Hawaii as well as most US tertitories
i can't help it
she's my favority
I know, I know..
favorite
: D
:P
Fav Rarity?
its a habit
yes
everybody loves EST
The Hub is likely referring to EDT right now, since it's a US network.
I think that's either completely wrong, or complete lunacy :P
list 4 times, one of which applies nowhere in the US
9hey guys
9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp8TB7gX4f8
I need a hug
And just where did he get a vibrosword.
/me hugs WhatPayne~
/me hugs back
Thank you
9Sumica, the series bible show he was planned to have it since day 1
9but it never made it into the actual show
It's okay to hug here
9but it's pretty much everpresent in the games
9also it actually IS a Vibrosword
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I GOT KILLED BY A CAZADOR!
trying to put pants on, right?
and i like
damn
died again
fucking cazadors
i'm pretty damnn excited
Me too, especially since I listened to the Thiessen interview
fqf
Guys?
Guuuys?
Oh go download it and listen, it's awesome :O
9:00 EDT.... I'm guessing
EDT?
it's the same as est
Eastern Daylight Time, which is the EST time zone
thiessen interview? :O
didn't know about that
omg i put a shirt on all by myself!
Hahaha I'm tetherd through my phone, into my VPN at home
thethering <3
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/exclusive-season-2-audio-interview-with.html
Go listen NAO
EST=GMT-5?
Looks like my problem here really is on my side of the network, not at home
It's not spoilerific at all, but has a lot of good info on the show
9-4 I Think
:O
No, EST is GMT-5
Yes, EST is GMT-5.
GUYS I CAN'T FIND ANY SOCKS
subtract one from the other, voila :P
wow
After the Summer months Eastern Time is shifted back by 1 hour to US Eastern Standard Time (EST) or (GMT-5).
This confuses me
I have a dedicated 10 meg fiber pipe at work, they shouldn't block any ports
Seriously Pinkie, stop and actually read the info the page is saying.
thanks RP
Then they're wrong.
GMT never changes due to seasons.
guys i am all dressed and ready for work! :D
:D i really don't wanna go
^
lol
oh don't worry. my license is suspended
._.
OH WELL

Now THAT I could get behind, Val
6:33

WoW is an abomination

WoW murdered everything that was good about Warcraft
literally
it killed off all the good characters
WoW and WC are extremely different
Val is just mad he cant have a LKxCaramel fix now.
Yet again, I'm without hugs :(

Inconceivable!
Ohey `Fluttershy is here too

Good idea, thanks KanyeEast

awesome
6Octavia!! :3
In Finland we (older folks, 20+) have noticed this phenomenon among kids essentially replacing the "cool alcoho drinking" behavior with energy drinks fad.
In america we combined the two
and called it four loko
13Hey
Something which we call being "Jonne"
er KanyeEast
As a college person I can only speculate on littler kids but here at uni many people do drink energy drinks
/me waves at the arriving people
nos>monster>anything else
It's not just drinking per say (I mean I drink energy drinks)
MFW I've already passed the level.
But it's this parents say "energy drinks are bad and should be banned from under 15 year old"
yeah well they ARE bad for you
And the kids do exact opposite
I'll put quality at lowest because Vrigin hates me. >_>
wat, Virgin is playing tricks on you? I thought they were a good ISP
Energy Drinks are for upper end athletes aren't they?
Like kids normally do... But as a side effect the alcohol drinking amongst young teens has dropped
Replaced by energy drinks...
It was apparently that bad
the interview was amazing
heheheheeh
streemception time.
Oh you finished listening to the Thiessen interview?
awesome
It likely helps that energy drinks don't require an ID to buy.
KanyeEast Ttue
*true
That interview seriously made me giddy inside
Bronystate.net, CAJ
KanyeEast, it seemed to be more implied to be fanart and PMVs rather than Fanfics. Due to the content.
exactly.
Yeah I think fanfics are barred on the FiM team
Luna?
6They are, Rainbow Dash.
LAWL
13lol Hey Silvermane and DecapKing :P
^_^
(lol ILU YGO:TAS)
/me hugs hekeshi
13Hehe <3
2,14 but I am waiting for the right time to introduce him to you all :P
13Justin Bieber, ewwww
ZUN made it?
/me 13cant have chocolate :(
He's too famous and expensive
and too harry potter
Yeah...
all the "i want to be ginger" comments
Oh wow
6Sorry Dari D;
SERIOUSLY
I can see it pinkie
2,14 Espy: FUND IT
Hehe, i know that problem
unfortunately
suspense!
he's got the crazy eyes going too
bets he's gunna screw up?
Watch, Dari'll get killed by the purple ball right before getting back to the goal.

6DARI WIN!!! :DD
EPIC WIN
Die, alot
It says SOS! Shoo be doo!
yep
Hey, is anyone here doing that PRG thing at 4:00?
The one that Chang is holding?
Yeah
PRG?
Ok I found image which embodies the kids+energy drinks
http://de.acidcow.com/pics/20091026/acid_picdump_71_02.jpg
Yeah i have to go somewhere and wont be back till this evening. tell him that PunchBolt won't be able to make it
I'm sorry
alright?
Those are girls (I suppose) but it's more regular amongst boys
Hey
I don't think anyone else from D&P is here yet
well youre from it right?
or no?
The Janitor is here.
Well, shit
yeah, but I won't make it
alright someone put in a word for both of us. i gotta leave in like 10 minutes or less
HAHA http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/256/6/9/look_before_you_dream_by_egophiliac-d49rfb2.png
i gotta go, bye
cya
people got pissed about the four loko thing in the U.S. and it was killing people
Well they have only stopped stores from selling them to kids, KanyeEast
I can still drink them :P
I believe they has not been banned per say. But the cashiers have been instructed not to sell them to kids under 15 here
Oh no, Dari, you'll have to do *6* times
kids under 15 really have no reason to drink energy drinks anyway
Here I believe it's illegal for stores to sell them to kids under 18
KanyeEast Where do you live?
same treatment as cigarettes
Now do it again
North Carolina, its mostly been at summer camps and places with lots of kids
Can I get a hug instead of the walls? I'm jelly
I believe the "ban" here has only encouraged kids to acquire them
/me hugs back. "Thanks guys"
Oh, cool, KanyeEast lives in NC
/me hugs RobotPinkie~
it was that one right there.
yup, i'm only here for college though
*waves*

http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/blogs/latest/entry/dsott-3-my-little-pony-fim
oh wow Dari is on level 28
i think that looks like 3.5
I think he'll do a "why fim is awesome" part 2 later in the week
Never mind, Just watching it
but he does a lead up to it
A shoggoth.
but shoggoths are cool too

I never realized how awful 3.0 and 3.5 were
ahhh kayne
why aren't you coming?
bawww
Hey this review is pretty good
taking long to load :(
6You can do it Dari!!
I doubt they'll appreciate my reasoning of "i'm roleplaying a pony and fighting skelatons" as a excuse
/me cheers for Dari~
i planned a boss fight and everything
aw
maybe trm
/me giggles~
if there arent enough, we'll do it trm
lol @ Katrina
i dont want to spoil it
but the boss fight is going to be demonic

demonic ponies? oh dear

6 24 HOURS REMAINING
Someone here should air this review
I mean stream
No, /this/ is joking...
How many half-elves does it take to screw in a light bulb?
But then Dari would learn of that clip.
6Somepony should send this to Retsuprae~
Huh, he made it
o.o
o.o
2,14 I believe dari's sound is gone
Why?
If this room had a swear jar... :P
I'd like to put a swear into the swear jar.
Like it's been doing the whole time? XD
Wee, cutting up onions.
DODGE
DOOOOOOODGE!
...Regardless, that was really good review
Freiza is my favorite part of the second season of dbz abridged
mainly because of how evil little kuriboh is at being a villian
Either he's the most gullible boy alive or he thinks I'm gullible.
He implied it would be Derpy or Luna
lol
bs
Burn him by the stake.
come to me, delicious ground beef. . .
luna would have to be in more episodes to count as a 'minor character'
Blasphemer
2 lines and 30 seconds of screen time do not a minor character make
Wait he said background character
but still I call BS
^
lol
6This MUSIC is killing me . .. x.x
Dari, just give it up
You're not gonna win

did the dude just go crazy?
/me 13has already seen it a million times lol
13The liked the witch sisters in it, they were really the main characters over the ponies.
He's like... my hero
I get the impression that in the old show none of the ponies had personalities
13Not really.
13By todays standards, they were rather bland.
hiya
That's a lot of OP's

inb4 >100 deaths
Beware, beware.
lol
Hiding
they have a set path
i bet this level really IS impossible
but each of them has a different pattern
and you have to get back to the start.
the middle one goes back and forth, the other four circle around it seems
Two of them are going around the outside, two are going around the inside, and one's going back and forth around the middle
2 on the out two mid and one center
Dari is flipping his shit
Very carefully.
and after this he dose it again on normal diffaculty.
and some times when it moves too fast
Slow ones hit that spot
Yeah
You cant win i think
it says in the corner
Err.. No "I think"
Wait there is similar spot on the left side too
I think...

Thunder_Dash, is quite the optmist.
IWBTG First level > HGE last level
Oh boy...
YEEEEES
really really
you poor, poor person.
it works fine for me
Not getting off THAT easily, Dari
Play Durrrrrrrrrrgarrrrrrrrrrr or something instead :P
Could we watch something?
Payne, we are going to watch pure rage
OH its one of those games...
pure anadulterated rage
Yeah... I dunno about that.
go look up one of the LP's of IWbTG
there are outtakes which are nothing but the word "F**K" repeated like a mantra.
9just here
Oh really? I haven't found any. I've probably just not gotten far enough.
Oh, it is.
it is.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhl9pJB-2Ak Battletoads
you're about to see.
The one on EqD is really laggy though, derpyhooves.com is fine
Everything kills you.
Everything.
the very level itself hates you
Saying that IWBTG is hard is like saying that getting hit by a train is slightly painful
pretty much, yeah
dude
We're Always Watching
WTF

I dont know of any spoilers in it as i have not heard it. But every one keeps spouting it has "spoilers" in it.
The farthest I've ever gotten was the 5th screen I believe
Are we supposed to listen something?
Seems pretty accurate.
@Pantsmeter

yeah
2,14 aahhhhh
9which might be disadvantegous or advantegeous
9god I just killed phonics
2,14 and I'm guessing that means you don't get the defense bonies as well?
wat
yes Val.
9it can be Disadvantageous or Advantageous
you get neither bonuses or penalties
9Forests, for example, grant def bonuses and evasion penalties
9and also make you move slower
I should watch more mecha anime. >_>;
some of them are flipping awesome.

Makes sense.
Hahaha
hehehehe, makes sense yeah
Breast Missiles!
I remade the stupid transparency cursor with a rainbow instead of steadily decreasing transparencies
hero: it's not a bad way to get into anime
(I dun' understand spanish, but I know french and they share the same latin root)
oh pH, that piece of shit of a design
...I lost my copy of it a couple years back though
/me brohoofs herospirit
60 bucks worth of import down the drain :p
/me brohoofs Nat
Egh.
2,14 out of curiosity
2,14 for mechs with multiple pilots
2,14 do the pilot's stats stack?
because they're mech animes?
dat map
13Hey
Hiya 'Tavi! <3
6Octy is back? :3 That was quick~
13Bleh,k friend turned my computer off the wrong way and royally messed it up.
Val, I have NO idea if they stack.
6Hallo Natleyn~ ;3
;3
9I think there's some stacking
/me waves back at Dermathil~
9but it's not exactly full-on stacking
9I don't really know the details
Oh, the lizards and the beasts.
Lizards working with Mechabeasts
yeah
I dunno if they were or if they were just at the same place, same time
2,14 yikes
2,14 glad to hear it's okay too :P
9pretty much
9also
9back
9thought up names?
yay~
2,14 welcome back
Hey everypony
13Which in turn really messed it up. First time I've had that from turning it off.
Still going with Snails.
13Well, this time was different.
2,14 Like Rarity Beam or something...
Hows everyone doing?
13Maybe. But I've ever had that issue before.
13*never
13Not with this computer anyway.
13I seriously thought someone must have took something out of it or did something more to it.
Aww yeah, Dragoon Claw
Which one was O Slave?
Gems.
Apparently, anyway
gotcha.
13Yeah
Oh man.
I'm sure that spear should make us think of the Heroic Spike dream sequence
13It was giving me the signs the OS was gone or corrupted
Yes.
6bootmgr.exe is missing
13lol
is the stream off or is my comp being a pain?
6OH FU--
13I thought maybe my roomie or one of his friends, since none of them like me too much right now, had intentionally done something to fuck it up.
9approved?
Huzzah.
/me stamp of approval
yeah
9P is Physical I think
9C is for Combo
9no no
excuse my fail
9P is Physical
wait, there are fist icons?
Never noticed em before
And the + sign in front instead of the fist icons?
9it's a crosshair
Back
9for ranged attacks
Ohhhhhh
9so Nomenclature Approved?
was using an ancient link
9well there's a pilot skill named Combo
9when you are in front of an enemy
9and that enemy has another enemy adjacent to them
9say, behind them
ooh, chain attacks
9if you have Combo Level 2 you can chain it to two other enemies as well
9not really
9since enemies have to be standing RIGHT BEHIND each other
9in a straight line
9and all Combo attacks are 1-Range
9okay, names approved?
9yeah
Looks good.
2,14 names look good to me
yeah
?
*J
9not really Espy
9when you fill everything that is not blue
9you can access the Upgrade Bonus
no, GBA
HHHHHNNNNNGGGG I WANT IT TO SATURADY ALREADY
I can wait.
I can't
9Brain Powerds
9yeah
how far later?
I guess she would
anyone else lagging?
seeing how they are well, brain-powered
Zil: a little bit, here and there
OH SHIT ANOTHER SEASON " CLIP ON EQD
Yep.
It is glorious.
CMC being adorable.
oh boy
Nadesico
I remember watching that anime a loooooooooooong time ago
is this
I don't even
2,14 and it is awesome
2,14 pure awesome
the Z2 one in the series is probably the most awesome of the bunch
It has Dai-Guard AND TTGL
2,14 but I still need to get that PSP game....if only I knew how
oh fuck i just watched it
SRW Z2
2,14 think it's called Taisen, right?
2,14 yeah, I want it hardcore
hehehehe
2,14 lol I like Ruri a lot (as a pilot at least)
Not Ruri
The girl
2,14 I was just saying I like Ruri
yeah, I don't like Yurika
Fukube is awesome.
I agree, Espy
JUSTICE!
SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE!!!
GOGOGO!!!
2,14 Oh I can answer that
ooh
9not really
2,14 if an Aestivalis is outside that grid, it is incredibly vulnerable
9the Yellow Field gives you UNLIMITED energy
Aww yeah, Dragoon Claw
I think that was something from the anime.
OOOH
Unlimited energy
I like the sound of that.
2,14 wait, but it also gives you defense doesn't it?
9like all other force-field type mech abilities
9you see it a lot more when on the grid
2,14 well, they do different things
SHHHHH ZIL
9they all have different stats and different weapons
Or is it always needed to have one of each?
well by needed I mean recommended
9just think about the situation you're in
9(when you get the Lunar Frame you'll probably be using that 24/7 though)
Hiya Nittany
is the Artillery frame generally useful?
Hi.
9in the right situation
(he had 8k hp)
2,14 yeah, I use mazinger and combattler for that
(2nd best mech had around 6k)
I basically wiped an entire wave of enemies by finger crushing them all
yes, Val.
I think
9it's SRW
2,14 oh god....my body is ready

2,14 it's a lie
9*!
no no it's welish
The girl prolly spoke of the accent
its not that different, you just add 'wanker' to the end of a sentence every once and awhile
Main reason I asked about Endless Frontier, is due to it being the only DS one that's been released in the US.
Haha
9Mugen no Frontier is actually a jRPG

Hi.
/me thinks that Dai-Guard is still one of the best mechs in the SRW Z2 roster
2,14 I would say don't talk about it until all rerun streams have finished
In otherwords, after the 26 episode ofS2?
2,14 I would say just be reasonable about it
I guess he means when we're about to stream episode 2
No, I mean say between Monday and Saturday after episode 1.
the samewith episodes 2-26
2,14 I'll talk it over with the other mods, and we'll let you know barry

Ahh.

Although it is pretty awesome as well.

Not my place to give out stream info, you have to talk to colored text for that.
Only one way to find out.
i'll check the site's code for it P:
4Haha, awesome

Tiny depressed trixie? must listen

i always do the first 3 characters
FINE
how the buildings fall apart
hm. steamcracked version...
i haven't seen that yet
It looks pretty awesome, a throwback to the shooters of old ages.
i need to get another 2tb drive. i'm running out of storage
At least you have 2tb.. I'm running on 500GB here >.>
Only things I know I'm getting between now and the end of the yea are BF3 and Uncharted 3. Everything else is on a case by case basis.
i have 2tb, 2x80gb, 2x750gb, and a 60gb ssd
._.
I have 1x60GB SSD, 1x320GB and 1x 1TB
OS, Games, Data.
In that order.
my 2x80gb i use for random shit and virtual machines
did he just fuck all three of those guys?
at once?
I was thinking of getting an SSD when I get the money, should I?
Yup
And probably.
TrollightSparkle, yes
but
like no prefetch. no hibernate. no defrag. and no pagefile on that drive
sleep
It's for speed.
TrollightSparkle, it's best for hte OS
well
best for anything lol
i was thinking about getting another ssd for raid
i'm a raid freak
:p
but really i'm just waiting for bulldozer to come out
lol
but then you only have 60gb lol
and it still wouldn't match an ssd
that thing
he takes the gun out to make them appear
The blue glowy thing that rebuilds them after he blows them up?
hm
i'm liking these environments
does it use physx?
omg time to pee
and the thing on the walkways it to repair them.
i'll watch more
i still got 64% of my bandwidth left
or i'll skype lol.
TrollightSparkle, oh it's not that baaad
When you're a fledgling computer nerd.. yeah..
TrollightSparkle, i'll help ya :3
Thank you much :)
And Ubuntu 10.10.
I've been told to downgrade to 9.04, I'm thinking about it.
eehhhhh i don't like ubuntu but i can work with it.
but htat's really just a personal preference
wait when did he get that suti?
TrollightSparkle, it's not too hard really. it's just different.
Yeah I know.
i would still say the best thing to know is comand line interface for anything
Been trying to learn some of terminal, it's a bit confusing.
you'll get the hang of it
learn how to navigate then you can learn how to use specific programs
if you want to be hardcore, learn gentoo. that'll teach you a lot
it's a distro that you build yourself from source code
Hmm.
Hi guys.

I'm at my high school
I'm not sure actually

DecapKnight: Utah
Flutterbro, you have my condolences
and apparently a lot of Mormons
Northern Utah is pretty nice
well Northern Wisconsin is nice in the summer at least
in the winter it sucks
oh, fun fact: over 60% of our land is locked up by the government!
Fun Fact: Wisconsin has the same type of weather as Alaska in winter, which is usually around 0 to -15 degrees daily
really cold in the winter and really hot in the summer
seriously
O.o
today its around freezing
tommorow its supposed to be around 70

oh
Pontang, no, that is a horrible link!
I can't see the broadcast :(
2,14 that's probably because no one is streaming :P
Lez miz is usually the name given to the play. While Les Miserables is often considered the book. :I
Maybe :p
lol
2,14 stop me violet....I'm reaching for my trident
Read the book.
It came first.
I might try reading it
I don't either, the text looks werid, i can't work out if i am misspelling things

Rainbow Dash Truely Is The Best Pony EVER
yes
awesome
:D
But also remember that urine is good growth environment for bacteria
if you get stung by an insect in the wild, and you dont have any other options, pee on the sting and it might help neutralise
That jellyfish sting pee thing is urban legend. Does not help
thougth that was only for jellyfish stings.
not jellyfish...
bluebottles
same familt
family
LMFAO
but different venom
THAT MADE MZY DAY
"pee on the sting*

10I don't think that worked out well for either of us...

/me 10clambers to his feet wearily
/me sighs. "Why can't my fillies be normal for once?"
I have the dumb.
/me shakes out her flank, starting a stumbling charge
"Because its fun to watch Silver"
I am sure you could just share SilverMane
19:00 is not 5pm.
/me 10widens his stance "Here we go"
I have no idea why I thought that...
I EVEN HAVE BATTLE MUSIC

/me 10turns on battle musi-*buffering*

SilverMane: Yes it is Tohou )

It tastes weird.

I'd lurk 24/7 but I have habit of turning off the computer when I go sleep
/me 10takes `Fluttershy's newfound momentum and flips `Fluttershy over his shoulder

/me yelps in pain as she's flipped over, slammed into the ground

/me comes back with tacos

I know, I know...
If I turned my computer off, I wouldn't be able to run progress quest 24/7 :(

"NOOOO" >>
"FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!"
/me 10is exhausted and exasperated
/me offers SilverMane a taco.
10Fine, a fight it is then.
/me cries. "I never got to ship with Sexy-Voice though!"
/me glares, standing up and panting
/me takes the taco, solaced by it. "Thanks Sumica"
/me 10lets loose a roar and gallops full-pelt at `Fluttershy with newfound enthusiasm
"Wait! Can I have in on this fight?"
If anyone's interested, here's chapter two of my story.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDl5sgHDuwLaGv_VbCV90Yns3uk1C_KWvrivR6fk4CA/edit?pli=1&hl=en_US
/me eyes widen, but she flies up into the air wearily, dropping as he comes underneath her
DecapKnight, you want to earn the title of Waifu of Silvermane?
this seems more fitting for this kind of fight.
/me 10slaps decapknight around the back of the head "It's bad enough having my throne contested by one pony"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jkNTPJ11eU
"Nope. I just want to fight"

"H-ha... I win......"
just keep in mind the prize is SilverMane DecapKnight
More like ponies at sea
"I'll take the silence as a yes
DecapKnight the prize is SilverMane >>
/me charges towards `Fluttershy at full speed
/me eyes widen "OH SH--" Is hit and flies back again, collapsing on the ground
And all things that winning SilverMane entailes
Fluttershy can have him
I just wanted to fight

"Well, thanks for the fight"

Godzilla
10tis gonna be epic
huh?
lol sc3
why do you think it'll be out 12 years from now?
I hated Jurassic Park II
because sc1 and sc2
2 more or less killed it
took 12 years
^
Because I read the book first
lol
every movie based on books
sucks when compared to the book
Yeah but it does not have to be like that.
then you'd need two parts for each book, and it would still be weird
they fucking cut off the fighting scene of the book from the movie
10ITT: people dissecting entertainment to an unnecessary level instead of just enjoying it
Deathly Hallows was probably one of the dullest movies made.
Fair enough.
I agree.
/me 10was just stirring shit

I see. I thought maybe my computer was being retarded :/
I just want to do something fun with some of you guys.
yes Val. audio spliter seems to want to piss me off today.
Sooooo.....how about them Minecrafts? 1.8 seems...fun. It's a lot more laggy now, though. My average FPS is in the 50's now..
1.8.1? sure I'll do that.
Yeah... my FPS dropped a whole ton after upgrading to 1.8
That's right, ChrisClark13. I even just updated and forgot about it lol
It's a lot more elaborate
Mine too.
though i run it on laptop and am hoping of gettin a job to by a good computer
yep
thats the sprit!
whos hosting?
cya
Ciao Dash!
As long as it's not secured, I'll join. I'll need an IP though obviously~

I'm attempting now.
I'm getting both

Ahhh
That makes sense.
ooh cutscene!
mfw ps1 graphics that can hold ground with modern movies
This is my childhood :0
ooh, weird mounts
Apparently not, as I just heard this.
You have yo admit, these graphics are more than amazing for ps1 graphics
to*
The music
OH THE MUSIC
I know.
I know its pre-rendered, but I'm just wondering how long they took the first time.
But most ps1 cutscenes weren't that good. At least not in the games I played. :0
"it"
In reference to something about the stream being banned or something and "playing it safe".
Blarglblarg I'm still nerding out over this, I'm sorry
no voiceovers?
And a chain of tiny tea cups
And....
MFW
Oh gog I'm draw some Dragoon ponies!
I'ma*
AM
that's a "dragon?"
Yeah I and many others been asking about the stream throughout the day as we often get these minor streams by Luna and others. And I suppose I missed someone at some point explaining the reason there would not be any "copyrighted" streams today due not wanting to risk it this close to season 2.

and espy.
ok then.. anyone remember castle of the winds? http://www.myabandonware.com/media/captures/C/castle-of-the-winds/castle-of-the-winds_4.gif
Legend of Dragoon: The Movie; with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Lavitz
Fund it
^
Eugh the movie.
>.>
REALLY? a movie?
Wait seriously
But overall I disliked the LOS speries.
series*
legend of selda
There was going to be... a Spyro movie?
:0
TLOS*
Yeah, it was terrible.
TLOS series
no loot?
In 5th grade, i wrote a story about Spyro fightin gan evil dragoness, beating her, and converting her, then dating happens
TLOS?
The Legend of Spyro
Lavitz is 100% man
Ahhhh
and then TLOS happened
It was the Spyro reboot.
lol
>_>
100
%
Man
I want a Spyro HD collection, that'd be nice
a shipfic? of spyro? from a 5th grader?
I see Dari has a fav already.
/me uses whiiirlwiiiind
Now it's being rebooted again with crappy Skylanders.

Nice way to ruin my childhood.
<_<

HHAAARRPOOOON

time to go mow the lawn! cya
TLoS had 3 games
Har-poon!
It's like FF
Seeya later, `FlutterBro
Cya FluttzBro
The 3rd one was interesting because it was pretty different.
You had free roam and free flight.
FF13 in no way detracts from FF10 for me.
Which was pretty strange.
Hey StarStriker.
hay StarStriker
Welcome.
Lavitz is best Pony
Dragoon I think.

Yes
It's Legend of Dragoon, which is infinitely superior to FF7
Okay then, brb
Yes.
LoD is probably the best JRPG I ever played, but I've only played a few JRPGs.
I knew it!
okay, i am on bronystate.net/theatre/ that is for s2 premier?
Snap, really?!? This was made in the U.S.?
Yeah, LoD Was made in the US, but it uses the JRPG gameplay standards.
Huh?

/me brohooves DecapKnight
9oh
9wait
9nevermind
9someone is streaming
the balloon version would be i wanna be inflated
Their CGI cutscenes are amazingly good for how old they are.
9I'll stream a bit later
0nononononono This is bad.
9also that's quality as expected of one of my faithful students
It is for me, but it always is for me
0This is definitely bad
=p
Oh. OH
The music is coming up
Legend of Dragoon
Legend of Dragoon
THE MUSIC IS COMING UP.
9ohhhhhhhh~
GONNA HAPPEN
Dart's Theme?
0Dragons are cool. Dragoons are alright.
DART'S THEME IS GONNA HAPEN
Dart's Theme is awesome.
where are my ponies!?
YYYYYEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
0Meh
they are waitinf for you on fri and sat Rarityfan
The more combos, the more awesome it is.
the combos are hard to pull off with the slight delay
A stream doesn't do it justice :p
Yeah, the longer combos were EVIL.
I'll asmit, I usually just got to the three-combo attacks and just used those
That, And parasite eve.
HARRRRRRPOOOOOOON!
Speaking of Awesome PS1 RPGs; anyone remember Xenogears?
I have that too
Heard of it, never played it.
XENOGEARS
Eghhhhhh
It's a turn-based JRPG right?
Turn based JRPG that utilized button input combos.
I got stuck between a boss and standard enemies, neither of which I could kill
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL-_0Yo4ZMQ
There's a link to some gameplay.
Hello.
That could turn her hands into guns?
that is xenosaga
xenosaga did make for a nice anime though
9in other news
<.<
(in retrospect that is)
9Xenoblade is grandiose
9and KOS-MOS is pretty awesome in SRW OG Saga
Just how many 'Xeno' games are there?
Yeah, that's the problem with Xenosaga.
it was both Vergil
Yeah, I know.
But the games might as well have just been movies.
-gears -saga -blade, etc; all the same universe?
They had MGS4 syndrome.
Fight a battle, 30 minute cutscene. 2 battles, 25 more minutes of cutscene.
Etc. Etc.
Yeah.
Hey everypony
It was MGS4 before MGS4.
Hiya Trollight!
Hi TrollightSparkle
Aren't most jrpg's just long linear stories with battles interspersed?
Granted, Xenogears did that too. But at least it was limited to the beginning of disc 2.
9at least according to the gaming press
Yeah, but the linear stories don't happen in huge chunks between sparse battles.
I mean, cut out the combat and you have a movie.
having never played it I disagree =p
9there's also the fact it could as well be called wRPG: The jRPG
I don't think I've seen xenoblade yet. kinda lost interest after the Saga games.
9Xenoblade is for the Wii, and it's great
Kinda reminds me of the SaGa series (ie: Romancing Saga).
TrollightSparkle, yep
Aww snap, nostalgiagasm :P
9>They expect it to flunk miserably BECAUSE NOT WAGGLAN
0Wagglan?
HI!
PinkieshydashSparkle, you forrgot the applejack
9ladies and gentlemen, NoA. The greatest money haters this side of the globe
.....Oh yes.
^le sigh
no, it just wouldn't fit...
That's not town it's .......
*coughcough*
I typed in "pinkyshydashsparklejackity"
well guys i gtg for now
9>NEXT UP IN OUR SCHEDULE, RELEASING MORE SHITTY WAGGLAN SHOVELWARE
9I played Disaster
9one of the few games for the Wii I enjoyed
IS THAT LEGEND OF DRAGOON?
It's like they're holding it HOSTAGE.:/
yep
just to be clear, the premiere is being streamed here on Saturday, right?
9well, if that's the case, you can watch our low-quality stream
9and PinkieshydashSparkle: DAT DA PLAN
Zelda? Oh, right. You mean the 'series' that is basically re-releases of Ocarina of time over and over.
ocarina of time is best time
9theoretically it should handle unlimited viewers
Ok, well thank you for answering my questions! And somewhat alleviating some of my fears. /)^3^(\
9Dman would know about that, he tended to do that a lot back when we were running Veemi
9ah
9well
9so uh
yah. might need to find a different stream or find a prog to work
9you could grab the file from there
good times :)
It's Legend of Dragoon.
Huh.
9no clue yet. Probably Megaupload.
Back
OMG, epic scene coming up.
both
at the same time
nah idk
Neat trick.
A stream within a stream?
:D
i heard you like streams
9don't go Streamception on me
Well that soldier didn't take much convincing . . .
9that's already happened here
9and ironically it happened with Inception
Wow, seriously?
9I had to stream a stream of Inception
SILVERMANE!
Sandora >>>>>>>> Basil
Yo dawg, I herd u liek streams?
9cause my download fucked up
this boss hax
The illusions suck -_-
Good luck :<
Hey everypony!
Hi Jen
?
What're we watching, currently?
Legend of Dragoon
fighting
Legend of Dragoon.
I like a Dart/Rose/Kongol setup. Dart is average, Rose is weak against physical and Kongol is weak against magic.
SPINNING CANE! VOLCANO!
HARRRRRRPOOOOOOOON!
GUST OF WIND-DANCE!
feh another boss
/me appears
How would that even work today? Shouting 'TRIGGERPULL BULLETSHOOT'?
Is this Legend of Dragoon?
yea
11yep
This is totally Legend of Dragoon.
:D
oh right cant fail combos on this one
Curses
lol
Tougher than I thought they were.
You seem disappointed
Ahoy!
D&P going on? I went to see a movie and just got back :O
D&P?
The damage of attacks is directly related to how cool they look.
#bronystate_d&p
Hardest additions in the games for me were the Dragoon physical attacks.
Let's have a think here
I found a ringpop and some taffy :3
finaly
D:
OH CRAP BRING THE WEAPONS BACK
You don't even have those in boy cartoons
Fighting is Magic is doing a fairly good job I think, when it comes to those standards.
mmyeah
Dem counters
You have to get the timing right.
Or else.
and thus a plot device was discovered.
Is the stream fucked for everyone else?
Dat unlock boss fight.
HAHA, SMT BOSS FIGHTS
4 discs of awesome
No kill like overkill.
Two different games, Seb.
In terms of difficulty.
Imagine if they did a rerelease of this with updated graphics
I'd say it's on par.
I drool over thoughts like that DreezeFrame
Vergil, how about Etrian Odyssey?
they need to rereleas this on bluray
Often times just to clear a boss you need to go do a bunch of fusions to get a monster, then level it up enough to fight the boss....
9Dart transformed into Spike
Dart is cooler than Spike
this makes me want to go and continue where i left off, on disc 3
Rose
Etrian is NOTHING compared to SMT.
That much I can say for certain. I was on the QA team for Etrian.
She's over 10K years old.
it pissed me off when Lavitz died
Meh, I prefer Albert over Lavitz.
well albert just seemed like a noob, where lavitz gave that pro feel
>_>
Snape kills dumbledore!
D:
FFFFFFFFFF
Too bad I've already read the books! :D
Vader is Luke's father!
got to dig this out of my closet and play it someday
Why hai there
Wow, thanks for spoiling it for me >:(
Han shoots first
Any others I missed?
TrollightSparkle!
Peater Parker is Spiderman!
hi everybody
Rainbow Dash, Dressed as Charlton Heston.
NO
mib_ihuk3h: LALALA NOT LISTENING
Hmm…is there anything special about Thursday night? Seems like a lot of people are on right now...
13­
Dunno
I cannot bring myself to use the term everyp
Did they really?
See? My English Gland stopped me.
0yeah, i saw it
0why is mine yellow
Didn't, cause I don't check EqD that often.
0i just came here for the first time
I see...
­
check it now dude
­
­
I have this gland in my brain that inflates whenever someone does something terrible to the English language.
Is it just me or is Wilkin not saying anything?
9gonna take over for a little while
0is it yellow to indicate text you've personally entered?
Yes, I am pretty shy-
­
I tried to play Borderlands the other day.
After about the 15th 'Pis off' sign, I passed out.
Vergil, Borderlands is hilarious
*sigh* I think I failed my Organic Chemistry quiz :/
This is why I would not survive post-apocolypse.
Borderlands is amazing. :D
ok bye everypony!
0cya
Bye!
Bye mib'
cio
Not because I have no survival skills, but because the blatant misspellings everywhere would kill me.
It's over for the moment, I think./
0alright
I think they may be switching.
Not sure.
*shrug*
UGH. G1 pony movie.
I'm SCARED, sarge!
No wai. We're actually watching G1 tomorrow?
G1 movie yes
A Movie is Bladerunner.
The bunkers. Head to them. NOW
TrollightSparkle: Yeah, My Little Pony The Movie from the 80s
The B-movie is "My Little Pony: The Movie".
:D
0 80s XD
A movie is blade runner
80's explains it all to me XD
I'm gonna need a LOT more alcohol....
0blade runner is a movie
tomorrow is going to be sweeeet
and all of g4 S1 right after g1 movie
9okay Fillies
9time for some BOOTFIGHTER WINDOM
WHOOT
Never heard of it.

Bootfighter

Uh
jor999: 2 PM EST for Pre Show, 7 PM EST for movie
EWWW ME

try refreshing
Minix!
WinXP SP-3 is my votw
FreeBSD!
vote
win7
SUDDENLY SPANISH
0wait is that spanish wikipedia about math
MATHS!
HAHAHA
Mediana?
0suddenly math, thousands of them
Ubuntu!
someone forgot to do their homework
9due to personal reasons
0alright
9okay
9uhhh
9guess I'll use XP Service Pack 3
no, use FreeBSD
I didn't know Snails was a pilot...
it's a Gundam!
OH NO, IT'S SNAIL!!!! RUN FOR THE HILLS EVERYPONY!!!!!!
Try a Somersault!
Dynasty Warriors? :o
Use the boost to chase!
Use Bombs wisely!
ARRRRRRRwing
0last weekend
oh hi invisable walls
So…this is My Little Pony?!
I can't let you do that, Star Fox
:P
They certainly have changed it since G3.5
0Mechs are magic
Alright, we're heading to Aquas-tria
0My little Gundam: laser swords are magic
Fluttershy's ship is in the docking bay.
lol
Cthulu Tech players do
needs more macross missle mayhem
=x
Maintenance on Rainbow Dash's ship is complete.
0is there a way to set afk?
0and are the chatnames remembered?
Location confirmed, sending supplies
"/away"?
idle for 10 min
0ok cool
0i probably should have tried that
You must construct additional pylons
Why u no ZZ Gundam?
Believe it
I don't believe
0additional supply depots are needed
More lumber is required
0wololo
This reminds me of Tenkaichi
The perspective, anyway
it's a PINCHA!
0so are these just streams of emulators?
That's pretty questionable
0for this at least
I can't find any Nueue Ziel downloads for Bootfighter.:<
Disappoint.
This is more like G Gundam
Send in the Crisis suit team
Also, the environments need work
For the Tau
in 2021 the OS wars began.
0wait why won't the high quality stream work
hey, another canadian
But not all of Mobile Suit Gundam was in outerspace.
every one loves SEED
No
Season 2 starts at 6 AM PST
No
No
0so wait how is the live stream working
ya
0no
0i mean chronologically
0tomorrow
Around 15 episodes of MSG took place on Earth.
0PST for me
thanks
OH YES I LIKE THE SOUDN OF THAT!
9that was Bootfighter Windom
9you can get it from here
0okay cool
who's streaming?
dat desktop
why is hub no streaming D:
9http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7XQ6T32Z
0also i have the vague feeling that's questionably legal
9beecause
9copyright bullshit
0is okay with this
9so we won't stream the Hub till it's time to stream the Hub
Because then that would be logical and they would lose viewers on TV.
9aka: the pony episodes
0no i mean
9anyways gonna switch to SRW
0lol i just meant streaming it at all
PONY VIDEOS :)
0seemed questionable
0not that its any of my concern
TV studios only know of who's watching based on how many people are watching their channel on TV.
0dvr'ing a show
0still counts as a view
0because in order to dvr it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNgg_8wfbF0&list=FL886Wj90ltvsyzkPhGylHqQ&feature=plpp
9Revolver: I patched SRW J myself
0it need stream the cable information
0it probably still counts
0yeah exactly
0how do you directly address a person, as in the bolded coloring
0is it
0@ or #?
0oh
By just typing their name.
0oh okay
0what does the hash tag do?
Oh wow, did not know the tab shortcut :P
^_^
9we're live again
Hurray for being Live!
Ban-presto? lol
0this is the most haphazard stream ever
0i like it
0me gusta face
SRW
I see.
FUCK YEAH, SPIKE.
0lol manticore
Broadcast is offline
0whats up with the 'high quality stream popout'?
use http://bronystate.net/theatre/
0it doesnt seem to lad
Broadcast is online, try and refresh the page mib_sf4yw0
0load
9Shutterfly: that's our old HQ player. We haven't been able to change it yet
0oh alright
0is the theater thing the same?
Awwwwww yeaaaaaa
refreshed twice, broadcast is offline
0cause of the theatre
^lolwhat
0is the anglican spelling
0yeah
9actually
0seems logical
i never knew there was a dif spelling (derp iam canadian)
0theater
0you mean web design guru?
0XD
9no no, the stream is hosted in another server
9so yeah
9Uribatake
Haha :P
He has the face of an asshole.
9Y u want to hit on the CMC?
Someone is hitting on CMC?
0yes, problem, his chin is jutting out of his face for like 5 inches
^
hes the son of j leno probably
0or you just keep entering it when you come back
We need the power of the Mane 6!
Some one set up us the bomb

0lol they just put a weird screen animation over the regular sprites
0main screen turn on
hello gentlecolts
Hello, how are you gentlemen?
NINJA'D!
Sucks to be you.
+200 Points
0wait theres a standalone version of then?
0this
Yes Seviper
the stream requires a site.
0oh yeah i remember now
0internet relay whatever
how long until some season 1 marathon?
Season 1 is after Movie Night
0ugh gtg
Movie night starts at 7 PM EST tomorrow.
Dont have to pay but after 30days it has a load time on start up TrollightSparkle
TrollightSparkle, well, even if that's the case, you can still use it as an IRC client no? :P
I'm stupid, please ignore me sometimes. :/
How does one become a pony?
not stupid, just missinformed.
....wow i have not used that line sence i stopped GMing for eve.
Hmm
mib_ppq0g9: Depends where you live.
You not in the United States?
/me is now a pony.

lol guv.nah
9naw
9so don't worry
Anyone know exactly WHICH SRW title this is?
probably one of them with SRW in the name
9SRW J
I wanna guess either Playstation or Dreamcast...
Man I realy want to show some gunbuster now.
whoa yeah
This one looks to have been on the GBA
on SRW titles by platform
it's spike
Cellular Phone?
yes if you count Nokia's talkie taco.
for some sort of phone apparently?
the Ngadge
aka the talkie taco
okay
Haha, you mean the N-Gage?
yeah
wait i just looked it up, wtf is this ngage thing
how could they possibly think that was a good idea
it was some crappy gameing/phone thing
But failed horribly.
very
have tryed to record but would have to use two programs to get a good quality image that is't interlaced.
see: gameboy micro
i remember it being in gamestop
for failed handhelds
inb4sexualreference
they are showing ep 201 6 times between saterday and monday.
massive army of bots
2.) The graphics/games
weren't spectacular enough to draw in any real attention
*rocket fires from awkward location*
hey gall_ could you make up ur mind with ut name
Hi
trainguy, just in case.
use the beam of war on it
seemed like a bit overkill
Yes, but not today.
6am pst 9am est
i think it was ten?
okay
oh, 9
6 AM PST, which is right after the Season 1 Marathon, which is right after the Movie Night
oh geez 6 Am pst?
Yeah
yeah
I'm on EST
is like
still means I have to get up early
at 1 AM
Just watch the entire Season 1 Marathon to keep you awake lol
that might work
I wish
some things are just worth staying up for
well I'll keep the computer on
pray all to Celestia and luna i dont sleep in (like i could even sleep the night before)
or waking up for
agree'd
why?
it happened once
i was thinking of camping too...
oh is that all?
9suddenly
How much memory you running?
no clue
>_>
-_-
uh
try typing
'system'
into the start menu search bar
gem romancer
You could right click "My Computer" and click "Properties " to find out.
i lol'd
well it's an older computer
then click system
i like how spike uses gems
yeah
lol no it doesn't
but it threads
*each* tab
9oh hey
hexacores and 8 gigs of memory does that to you
9Spike learned Combo L1
lol
lol i have 4 gigs ddr3 its not a problem for me
well it says the virtual memory is about 720 megs
like I said, old computer
lol
Hot damn.
i havent tried 100 tabs yet
But I use FF
but the kmost ive done was pretty big,a nd it was fine, even reloading all of them at once
aka graphics card
but with
TEAMWORK
that much gpu memory
it could be only maybe 3 years old
or just my computer
That's actually just the virtual memory that the computer allocates.
it should be on the bottom bar
oh wait
of course, the best way to remember ur computer stats is to put the memory and hardware in urself
did he say
crap
i accidentally my browser
i can resite my specs by heart
well anyway, I can try camping out
there we go
the whole thing awolfers?
mind you I won't be able to sleep anyway
and modding a laptop is a pain
yeah
compared to a desktop
too much of a pain
i have expanded ram though
then when my girlfriend calls and I have to explain why I ddin't sleep all night
that I was up watching ponies
Still kickin'
for me, i tgot the largest motherboard physcially possible XD
yeah
yep
yeah
thats wont be a terrible
although admitedly it'll be less fun
mIRC or something
except it's still one night away
wait is it tomorrow night?
or tonight?
yes
or in this special case, us watchign someone play a videogame
tomorrow
