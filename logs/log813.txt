Edd Ed and Eddy had it's own humor that couldn't be compared to humor like animaniacs
well, good animated shows are coming, after all
My favorite animated show is Avatar: The Last Airbender
(not that I can receive the Hub)
I'm sorry but this is a close second, seeing as I hold EE&E closer to my heart since I grew up with it.
Samuri jack for atmoshpere
We're pretty much in an animation rennaisance. Just look at Toonami and Nicktoons. And Vortexx. And The Hub.
...AAAAAAAHHH YEAAAAAAH!!
I never got to watch Animaniacs much.

AppleBloom: Right now I'm busy playing GT5
Java: how is the psn? I got a 360, but was curious how the psn runs
AppleBloom: very smiler
AppleBloom: i got both
PSN is free for online play. Also you got free games when you sign up for PSN+
As if it weren't way way way before that
5-8 free games
Java: are they any good though?
00,02not going too well
they cycle the free games every couple months
Boo
Java: thats a bad thing
my dogs are going ape shit
00,02XD
Once you do all the story mission in inFamous, you're kinda done...
Well, the story is good.I prefer to screw around in Saint Row
THQ is closing down :(
AppleBloom, I did like that mode.
I once sprayed Random paint over a random neighbor. He has gone APE SHIT
Java, I'm just saying. Comparitively, I liked Prototype's endgame compared to inFamous.
Oh well. That's alright
Everyone have their own preferences
AppleBloom, he never shows emotion though...
i got to go
night all
Night Nerdy.
I still wait for Last of Us
night samurizz
/me hugs AppleBloom
that thing is a beaut
:p
:P
AppleBloom, when you're a bio-weapon that can turn into a weapon BUT STILL use weapons, I couldn't care less about the damn character development.
00,02if you can
Spyro became toy seller :(
If it isn't a realistic shooter, people won't pour their money into it.
Rayman survive though
Heard that Prototype's boss battles were a mess though
00,02:(
that's MvM for you
Mmhmm.
Go get it dude, winter sales. Also JC2 now have multiplayer.
Cheap=/=bad
Some games are too underrated
Nier for example
Nier <3
Java, I have heard that.
OOPS
Also crotch shots :p
Yes :p
!cd
Slowmotion + crotchshots = hilarity
Java: Diving crotch shots, then rolling on cart in slow mode
AppleBloom: absolutely.

Java, Indonesia :p
oooooh, Hi indonesia!
7 PM here
Hello AppleBloom :)
ok brb
kk
I just one of my talking buddies... I am sad now :'(
lost one*
Well I must part but before I go
I must say
if you watch any episode without thinking about the fandom
there is no fan-pandering
think about it
anyway
au revoir mes amis
Trixie's episode sure does confirm that. But not at the level everyone's crying about. But yeah. There's definately no pandas.
00,02AppleBloom, 13
AppleBloom, I blame this season's feel. There's a damn reason people are crying about pandas. It's just as bad to ignore as well to exagurate it.
Yes. I do.
00,02no, 13 episodes
There's rumors about a movie length episodes, but nothing sure
00,02Uboa-San, not a clie
00,02clue'
And it suddendly got way worse
wow
that was same seriously bad lagg
Off-Air now.
isn't the end of the world in 4 hours?
>_ >
<_ <
I shamelessly say that one if you ask.
Every time.
okidoki I shall.
AppleBloom, I didn't write it. Did I say I did?... Oops.
.-.
night all and have a good end of world
/me curls up in ball and cries

cool story
00,02Alchemist, i have :)
Not near the goddamn week ends, that's for sure.
My point is proven even more.
*cough*
yet america dosent
well we aren't constantly in a war with our neighbors
also, we don't have rockets shot at us every day
they were fairly succesful last time
there were like, 5 this year
i know the theater and the school where else
the mall
theater,mall,school
maybe a church also but i only heard of the theater mall and school
they cant breake in
People like blaming objects because objects can't argue back. Too afraid to blame a person.
bullets kill people
00,02String_Shredder, yeah but thats westboro, i honestly dont give a crap about anything they say

thats cool naikravwoc
one real people, or just TV people
yea thay always blame games and guns but not the person
hah
Well IF ONLY.
Ikr
asking "why kill others" in these situations is pointless.
00,02and yes, we have laws against pointy things in victoria, its quite silly
pointy things...
my school was just on tv talking about someone bringing a gun to school
we are not allowed to bring backpacks
00,02Ninjazz, i wouldnt put it past them
Lel.
lel
lawl
lwal
00,02so you can legally carry one around
Here any knives which are longer than 4 inches are illegal to wear. Switchblades are illegal regardless of size.
seriously they might as well have up naked cuz anyone can kill anyone with just about anything
00,02but if it is a sword, then you need a licence
00,02djblazekin, i'm prety sure i could do damage even if naked
I'm sure it'll happen eventually
00,02which are verry real things
00,02banning weapons won't solve anything
Good afternoon everyone :)
00,02and then you have the psychological effects of banning, ever read about the alcohol prohobition?
00,02djblazekin, neither can i :3
i heard something about allowing firearms to teachers
00,02what seems to be happening here is because knives are banned, having one becomes a status symbol
Pfft
00,02i imagine exactly this would happen with guns in america
hmm
probably
00,02^^^^^^^^^^^
heck in japan only military and police can have guns the rest of cociety well have thier tools
00,02this kind of thing is very sensetive to culture, one population would reject prohibition, another would acceptr
00,02accept it'
and i feel my colour is distracting
good
because it is
I like colours though :)
