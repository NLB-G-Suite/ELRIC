Same here :D
00,10we moved up movie night cause end of the world
Shizuka: Ya, only 1
IT'S FRIDAY NIIIIIGHT
Also some fun fact Shizuka Blizzard attempted to obfuscate the Butcher's identity in the game files during the Diablo III beta by assigning him a "code name", being "Withers", which like all of the Diablo III internal code names, was equestrian in nature. A "withers" is an anatomical term for a portion of a horse's shoulder area. :D
Blaze666: *Giggles and places my hands on my mouth*
:D That Math

No one love Beta :(
Cypresswolf, AWW YEA
Not gonna say aliens
RDash5000: ancient aliens
But aliens
00,10Beta is way better then VHS
what is this VHS you speak of?
Sumica: agreed
whats beta
RDash5000: Don't worry yourself about it, just enjoy the film ;)
Are VHS even made anymore?
cachi01: *x-files theme*
I still have a VHS
Cypresswolf: Can you find THAT in Soviet Russia?
Before HD DVD, there was Beta
yay
o.o
Betamax 4 lyfe
00,10Beta max, it was the compeating product to VHS
never heard of beta :P
00,10it looked better then VHS
:S
I once saw a Laser Disc machine
Hey uh... do some people here honestly not know what VHS is?
It's smaller than VHS
VenHur: In Soviet Russia, Car bars You
funny story, i watched this movie for the first time ever yesterday.
00,10the problem was the Porn indisty went with VHS
I still have VHS tapes
Kurra most people here are from the DVD Era
no, before HD DVD, there was LASER DISC
00,10so beta was doomed
Dammit porn
Zamer, I figure, but.....
...
ahh laser discs
DAMN YOU INTERNET!
No...VHS are outdated by DVDs...which are now slowly fading away with Blu-Rays.
wiggity wack
are there really people here who don't know what a VHS is?
Every format is being replaced by digital.
no hello for me, Meth?
which is scary
swaggity swag whats in the bag?
Buytoast: yep, we're old
It's a tape...that plays video...
Buytoast: i was making a joke
Sumica: the worst part was because VHS was bigger and bulkier it's harder to hide
'Nuff said.
I still buy CDs for FLAC ripping.
yay
lol
incoming tip
If the porn industry went with VHS, and everyone else went with Betamax, I'd be VERY proud to go with Betamax
brb bronystate!
never had betamax, so why did it lost to VHS anyway?
See ya
00,10there was also a down side to beta was it was only able to hold 2 hours
I know I'm not the only one hearinf fluttershy saying yay
*with
Betamax still used for broadcasting though
00,10VHS could do up to 6 hours
betamax was too beta
was also expensive
So high tech
Hey look an iPad!
xDDD
Sumica: who want 6 hours of porn?
Nothing is more expensive than a PS3 at launch
Some WHS stuff could do 8 hours. At ass quality, but....
Sumica, only at reduced quality.
00,10no clue i never need more then 5 min my self

plus Mayan Calander ended years ago
^
i just want to see what happens when the terrible fate timer goes out
Zamer: actually Mayan calendar said that we still have another 7000 years
00,10If I dont make it throught this, tell my wife hello
Yes, they found the second calendar
dat futurama reference
if i die, make sure i look awesome
yea because each calander is made for a specific cycle
Sumica: I have no strong feelings either way
beige alert?
PUT ON 2012 AFTER THIS
who exactly is "they"? Java?
Actually Mayan Calendar is susceptible to Y2K, so actually the year is 2199 and we are all brians in a vat
JUST FOR LAUGHS
00,10they relise the calender had a back side eh Java?
Mr_Anybody: the archeologist of course
WHO?!
DIE HARD :D
00,10we had 2012 last month
I NEED TO KNOW!]
Maybe I should say "Hey, can I have your phone number to talk to you over the break?"
Sumica: Actually they found the second calendar painted, not carved
Kurra, the calender failed to take leapyears into account. So it was supposed to happen before this movie was made.
SO?
I think they run out of budget for a new stone
Sumica: It had a backside...wow that made me laugh.
Kandarihu, I honestly could care less about the Mayan calendar. I'm just being silly. XD
no they did include leap years apparently
DOUCHE
No Senior No one home
Dickless
they had leap years when they made the calender

Trivia: The Sarge shot Karl in the original novel. However, in the novel, the woman in Danger wasn't the hero's wife, but the daughter-- and she dies. The ending for the movie was rewritten for a slightly "happier" ending.

It was such a masterpiece.
LUNA!

OohShiny: you guys ever get snow?
RDash5000: In Brazil, it's summer all the year
^
OohShiny: i figured, just asking.
just like Alabama
and the rest of the south
Wow, just got here in time for intermission
OohShiny: Technically, it's not summer. It's just that winter is terribly inefficient down there.\

Same, technically we have winter here in Arizona, but it's more like an extended spring because all the plants come back to life in the winter. They die of heat in the summer. ;)

what can't he do?
Sadly, this is where Animaniacs hitted the end of the road...
God now THIS is when cartoons werereally good
Mike|Explosives: die
I'm inclined to disagree massively, Mike|Explosives.
Hell no, best animated TV show of all time is Dexter's Laboratory!
C'mon guys! Never give up hope!
We'll have anotyher golden age of cartoons yet.
Still, I missed Animaniacs, let us pray for reruns of this.
pony_1234: nope

Best animated show was Samuri Jack
fuckin boss movie :D
best animated show is NFL XD
00,10VenHur, hub has picked up the show
Edd Ed and Eddy had it's own humor that couldn't be compared to humor like animaniacs
well, good animated shows are coming, after all
Mike|Explosives: ed edd n eddy is stupid fun, animaniacs is just pure fun without being stupid
Sumica, remind me to hug you for that news.
My favorite animated show is Avatar: The Last Airbender
so, how about them gargoyles
(not that I can receive the Hub)
Aloysious I watched ED Edd and Eddy All my life...animanics is a better show
cowvarkian: fuck no
I'm sorry but this is a close second, seeing as I hold EE&E closer to my heart since I grew up with it.
Samuri jack for atmoshpere
animaniacs and batman the animated series FOR LIFE
Sumica: ...Remind me to explode in happiness in t-minus 5 seconds...
Stellafera I second that!
Bronysith: good to know
We're pretty much in an animation rennaisance. Just look at Toonami and Nicktoons. And Vortexx. And The Hub.
...AAAAAAAHHH YEAAAAAAH!!
I never got to watch Animaniacs much.
00,10you many explode earlyer then that VenHur
Batman Beyond > B:TAS by a very small margin
Yep, this animation rennaisance is epic
Mike|Explosives: me neither
:p
Its production quality is higher, its humour is better, and I could go on, Mike|Explosives. :P
I'm talking about MLP, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, you know

Akihiko: but saluting with tears
Proooceed
Good news, I checked the Hub's site, and what Sumica said is true, Animaniacs's on reruns!
You know what? I loved this show when I was a teenager. But, I don't know. It doesn't have the same magic for me as it once did.

The Party bus is a timid creature. Although, do not try to attack one without the element of surprise. Their sturdy shells and speed make a devasting combo when it comes to self defence.

Sumica: STOP! You've violated the law!
nice XAX , bit of the left eye is cliping through the curve there and the face is usually facing the opposite way
computer is not respondning
cratorkid: we chose the directions and their definitions, there are no natural directions
The dateline is the opposite side of the world as the Prime Meridian
Alright. I just bought the Deus Ex Collection, and come to think of it, I think this is getting in my way of the DXHR Augmented Edition.
SpeccyRush: Yeah, it's facing to the right because looking right makes it look at my name when it comes up in a killcam
XAX, oo that's clever
well, the new entity trailer is amazing
DRUNK AMBULANCE
ambalamps has a good driver
GO HOME YOU ARE DRUNK
Um....
The fuck is going on with the ambulance
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: i think it died
That one guy is holding it up
Jerk
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
Sumica: bowling
:L

http://img5.joyreactor.cc/pics/post/full/art-%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%8B-PlanetSide-2-481625.jpeg not sure if pony
twilight_sprinkle: that can be argued, im still curious why we chose north to be where it is, and why west isnt in its place, and why the dateline is where it is when a sphere has no begining or end, sorry, just lost in thought
dem rants
thanks for the sandvich Phase4 xD
Phase4: :D
ouo: uhhh...
ouo: Um, that's somewhat NSFW.
00,02TheGreatAndPowerfulT, XD
ouo: okay nice arse yes but next time ask a mod, kind of NSFW
Phase4: well that was fun
00,02indeed
mecha engineers aint too bad
oh ok, forgot about kids chat :\
CAB DRIVER STOP BEING DRUNK
TheGreatAndPowerfulT You were a damn good Pyro buddy in that MvM.
i suppose an assload of them might cause trouble though
AJIsAwesome not even close to NSFW
cratorkid, the names of the directions don't matter
hey guys?
DashWithRainbows and i don't play pyro that much xD
cratorkid: afaik we chose the world poles and magnet poles independant of each other, we didnt know earth was magnetic when we made the choices
I have a welovefine.com 10% off code if anyone wants to know
if you actually shoot at the arms dealer?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Maybe, but it's not really appropriate for thie chat.
*this
DashWithRainbows: oh sure, no love for the enduring Heavy
I don't want it to just go to waste
AJIsAwesome saucy at best and that for a mod to decide i guess
its "2012cons" and it expires the end of March, so... go for it I guess
Yep, because the heavy was a potato,
don't worry otakon, i got them all there money and i aint gettin a lick of praise
:P
only criticism
I never used grenades, they felt useless
Buytoast: eeyup but then again you kept hitting me
like the fan of war would kil anything
back to text idle
I am off to bed Se ya guuys at movie night! :)
NIght Sabershy :)
Bye, Sabershy. :)
night Sabershy
for the stream, Sumica. :)
*Thanks
lawl, Buytoast wanting praise
Besides, we couldn't of done it without you getting a lot of the money, Buytoast.
Looks like he just got it, twilight_sprinkle.
I better go as well, night guys
bye Sabershy
BYe, Darf14. :)
you see? i truly am the greatest
night Darf14
oh well... :/
H.O.T
Kurra: Seems nice to have, but since I don't really shop on welovefine I probably wouldn't need it. Thank you for the offer, though. :)
i saw that
Go home you're drunk
And otakon, you made a good distraction for me to heal :P Ponies47 was a good Engie, alongside Phase4.
well since I know lots of ponies could appreciate even a bit of money off...
There, everyone has credit, I go to bed now.
they just couldn't kill me
BYe, DashWithRainbows. :)
too bad i wasnt there, i wouldve messed your guys' crap up
DashWithRainbows: yay, I went for enduring Heavy
ninight all, AJIsAwesome... *hoof taps out*
See you later, Kurra. :)
Hah
niko, what a gent
sumi why are you picking up a hooker?..... wait
bye Kurra
twilight_sprinkle: and that is why i told you to join them :3
i realize the names dont matter, but, there is a reason why we have the north pole at the "top" of a map and not say, europe. as well as the dateline not being in Utah
thelonecubone: ohh so Thats how it is :I
How it is?

ded
[07:40:32] ->> Chrysalis :Nick/channel is temporarily unavailable
Sumica: park it on the tracks
this is not fun
not fun at all
yes
hit a train!
it looks like he mistyped the command and tried to join the channel "Nick"
say "i like trains"
MirrorImage nope
./nick Chrysalis
i can't log in :(
don't see the name active under the whois
test
:'(
right lets try it this way then
what, that nick is on this account
Train surfing!
Goldframe - low ceiling ahead
unfoundbug i think there was a command to avoid the that
dead
jump off a 30 floor building in a car? 0 damage
fall off a train - LOLDED
euch i actually have to go to work now
MirrorImage: ikr
Sumica: yeah gta 4 really lacks the ability of the prev games to hop on a vehicle, hit it to make it go fast and shoot people from there
but its gonna peave me off i couldnt log in
when has physics ever worked in a GTA game?
actually, the physics are pretty good
well in this case it worked, just not in favor
a little flaky
but better than msot
most*
mornin' eveypony
hoi SirGanjalf
*every
Hai
hello SirGanjalf
Hi SirGanjalf :)
ello SirGanjalf
hi sugarcube
dat slide
Sumica: this is probably an obvious question, if skyrim runs badly on my laptop, is there any chance gta 4 would run better?
10/10
twilight_sprinkle: maybe
twilight_sprinkle - probably. a lot of Skyrim's performance issues could probably be chalked up to the fact that it saves EVERYTHING
including the fact that you stole that singular fork from Castle Whiterun
Wait a minute! If you are in a police car... THEN YOU ARE INVINCIBLE
hmm okay, maybe i should try it
thx
ded
they got one good shot on ya
write "allcarsgoboom"
MirrorImage: i know for sure that the lighting in skyrim was the biggest problem for me
Sumica: there was money
twilight_sprinkle - yeah, that'll do it as well
MirrorImage: so i guess not much chance of gta 4 running better on that front?
do u have pfone?
no, you should be fine
heck, even tf2 was lagging for me a bit today
GTA4 doesn't have quite as detailed a lighting engine
what graphics settings?
twilight_sprinkle: it lags me every time
MirrorImage: i only set it to my laptops max resolution, didnt look at the other settings yet
Keep your eyes on the road Gentlecolts
Sumica - let me rephrase that then. it doesn't have as many objects to track (and by extension, less light/shadows to calculate)
i've got some missing textures can you help me? :(
and twilight_sprinkle, a laptop will explain just as much
i turned off the fancy lighting, and i even set a mod for simplified lighting in skyrim, but the lighting still hurts the fps, and i ran it on 800x600 as it is
in portal 2
Or at least remember to wear a seat belt
laptops, even gaming ones, are notoriously underpowered
Apparently thay dont have those in the GTA world
i've got missing textures in portal 2. Are you gonna help?
"caution your blast"???
MirrorImage: so if skyrim loses some framerate during battles with much lighting even though i turned everything off and have a light simplifier mod and i run it on 800x600 and i use a laptop, what are the chances of gta 4 running tolerably at least on 800x600?
like a plane!
like a boss parody
twilight_sprinkle - realize that Skyrim is much more "visually impressive" than GTA4
will GTA4 run well like Sumica has right now? no, probably not
MirrorImage: i know, but i wanted to hear what you think of the chances, im thinking of whether i should bother trying or not
but it will almost definitely run better
my friend's graphics card cant even open minecraft XD
5 minutes
eraykaan - that sounds like he's missing Java
Indeed
nope. bad graphics card
ded
and then there were bumper boats

aniderp|bestcakeever: oh...i heard sumi talking though, thats why i thought that :$
SpirittHooves: or make a craft to travel in space and land on planets and come back.

School's over!
Yay Lil_B ! :) hope it was a succesful semester
Chat is the deadest at 10-13 Middel Eurpoean Timezone
Alchemist well, my apprentenceship in school has no semester xD just regular school years
regardless, I hope it was okay :)
look
idiots
actually it wasn't :/ my Gareds are horrible :/ I may not make it to univesary with that :(
.taht enod evah tndluohS uoY
the world dident end now shut up
Lil_B: but its not 100% yet, right?
Im listening to the Song of SEVERE Unhealing.
Pony videos on The Song of SEVERE Unhealing's Other Videos.
Alchemist well, my grades are "Meh" and should be better for studying Chemistry, but the chances aren't 100% of my not getting in, but I will not have much chances making them better in the second half of this year (it's the lkast year) because it mostly consits of preparing for exams
Well then just study like crazy and see what happens. You can try again 1 year later if you dont get in, right?
don't quite know... I word try to get a Job if I don't get in... the other thing I could do would be trying this year over again, but that would offset my Mom, and as long as I still live here, I better not do that xD
Doesnt sound that bad for a worst case scenario
speaking of..
yeah, it is not a bad situation I'm in, it's just not as good as I wanted it to be :/
want to see my fail picture of BEN?
yes.

man chat is just teaming with life
Well i'm going to sleep, Night everyone
kia ora every pony
There you are therainbowvortex
hey Moopy im just here waiting for the end
Me too. while watching Death...
Dude its not going to end my parents don't even beleave that
*believe
it should hapan any time now oblivion awaits me
Well you know what dude my friends on the xbox told me that its not going to end and my parents don't think of that to as well
Man it's getting slower and slower here.
ikr
:/
every thing comes to an end if not today i await the day this world burns
I ended up listening to this song on repeat. Even when I don't play the game X(
http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=P0CxIJBHBVQ
No dude i don't want the world to burn thats crazy man
Joker: "Everthing burn"
Java: Batman: WHEREEISHEEE!?
But the earth is protected like a big sheild around it
Moopy: well time is the destroyer of all things
Uh huh sure like i want to beleave that
But what about water? Can water burn?
therainbowvortex: if that's the case then isnt time the creator of all things aswell?
water can not burn water can put out hot stuff
that Doom game is pretty interesting
lol hot stuff
im not kidding dude
AppleBloom: that is true but nothing nothing can stop the end
Moopy: if you try to put out burning magnesium with water you will have trouble. It burns at such high temp that it will decompose the water into hydrogen and oxigen molecules and it will go boom.
Moopy: so in a sense water can burn :D
Yes
Oh what like magma of course
I'd listen to the Alchemist, I mean just by his name I believe him
therainbowvortex: So nothing can stop the end, but without the beginning there will be no end. So if there is no beginning of the end, is there even an end?
and who doesnt want to burn the whole world? :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61XUb28jkUI
AppleBloom: end beging dose it really matter what is the end but the start of a new storie
therainbowvortex: right, but if the ending of the story ceases to begin, we go down a continuess path towards the end that will never stop. Thus an infinite loop toward's our demise with no end in sight.
AppleBloom: okay im gona stop talking to u now jk
therainbowvortex: :'( you just began the end of the conversation, NOOOOOOO!!!
00,10https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcQxXpFIID0
Ok how the buck is Ron going to burn the freakin world huh? oh so what just get a machine to make him grow bigger and burn teh yeah right my ass
AppleBloom: lol why did i ever stop coming here
therainbowvortex: I never knew you left the site, then again i'm still fairly new here

Hehe.
geeky: crafty zombie! Your a good man geeky. Taking him out before he could take us out.
geeky: modern zombies look too much like dirty hobos, bad times D:
AppleBloom: no he was crying for help the entier time i feel knda bad
MadSurge: i know right
geeky: That was the creatures call for back up. Remember always aim for the head, that's the only way to be sure.
I wonder what Fox News will say when they see this chat
AppleBloom: i got kinfes
Video games made children violents! derp!
Java: OMG DEMOCRATIC PERVERTS
Java: pleas tell me your trolling

wait a minut
HE DID IT =D
LINK STOPED THE MOON IN THREE DAYS
too long
we saved!
=3
Ashura is better, he punch the moon to its normal shape
Ashura's Wrath, underrated game
prey is an underrated game. Your a cheokee indiand who gets kidnapped by aliens o.O
Only on 360
Then you got to use your spirit walk powers to kill aliens
Phase4: secksie lag
going to het 360 eventually but now I don't have that money
00,02this is not going so well
And my friend put a list of 2000 steam winter discounts X(
money T_T
so many bullets
Ze Lag.
Java: you got a ps3?
yeah
Hello Bronystate! How are we doing this morning?
Marx: waiting to die how are you
AppleBloom: Right now I'm busy playing GT5
Java: how is the psn? I got a 360, but was curious how the psn runs
AppleBloom: very smiler
AppleBloom: i got both
PSN is free for online play. Also you got free games when you sign up for PSN+
I'm doing fine geeky. The whole doomsday thing is actually already proven false by this point.
As if it weren't way way way before that
Marx: yah cus link stoped the moon in time
5-8 free games
00,02i might just give up on this game
Java: are they any good though?
00,02not going too well
Ze Lag!
Funny you should say that geeky. That's exactly what I just did!
Bioshock 2, Infamous those stuff
Marx: played that zelda game
they cycle the free games every couple months
you can google what free games they give to PSN+ users this month
Boo
Infamous is better :p
Java: thats a bad thing
Phase4: how can you tell the games going bad? I have no idea whats happening :P
Commence the video gme flame wars :P
my dogs are going ape shit
00,02XD
Once you do all the story mission in inFamous, you're kinda done...
Ninjazz: that metal armour stuff looked so awesome!
Well, the story is good.I prefer to screw around in Saint Row
THQ is closing down :(
AppleBloom, I did like that mode.
I once sprayed Random paint over a random neighbor. He has gone APE SHIT
Ninjazz: the second Infamous is better :)
Dammit THQ, I love your games but your management is a mess.
MadSurge, that I agree whole heartedly.
Oh well. That's alright
Ninjazz: Just go ham on everyone with a face like this :[
Everyone have their own preferences
IM BATMAN
AppleBloom, he never shows emotion though...
i got to go
He kinda just stays neutral about everything really.
night all
Night Nerdy.
Phase needs to upgrade his melee speed.
Ninjazz: yeah... Character development not so good.
night geeky
I still wait for Last of Us
night samurizz
/me hugs AppleBloom
that thing is a beaut
:p
:P
Java: me too! Naughty Dog makes good games :)
/me hugs geeky back
AppleBloom, when you're a bio-weapon that can turn into a weapon BUT STILL use weapons, I couldn't care less about the damn character development.
I miss crash games >.> I miss frogger for that matter too
Ninjazz: If you want crazy fun go get Just Cause 2
Ninjazz: Inweaption?
Only game of Crash i remember playing is Wrath of Cortex.
Dammit we need Crash
But planning to get Dragon Dogma.
Java, I wish I didn't just rent that game.
Java: thats what the world needs right now, A NEW CRASH GAME!
Crash is dead
Conker and Crash are dead :(
Want me to join in, Phase4?
Buytoast: Why you gotta break my heart? :(
00,02if you can
AppleBloom, you know. He could use freakin helicopters. I loved that. Favorite part of that game was killing everything in those choppers.
Looks like you guys could use a Medic.
Spyro became toy seller :(
If it isn't a realistic shooter, people won't pour their money into it.
That's all the little bastards want these days
Rayman survive though
Better than ever
Ninjazz: Copter hopping was awesome! Would kill one guy then use that sling like weapon to cling onto the next one
MadSurge: oh big time
MadSurge, definately.
MadSurge: Didn't make them any less awesome
Phase4 It disconnects me, saying that the server only accepts connections through matchmaking. Ad-hoc connections are not allowed.
00,02:(
Ninjazz: with Just Cause 2 you can hook two 747 and see them flying around
Ninjazz: Did you have any problems with the last boss? Because I died like 10 times before finally ending him lol
that's MvM for you
Mmhmm.
Java, REALLY sad I only rented that game...
Go get it dude, winter sales. Also JC2 now have multiplayer.
man i should've been asleep seven hours ago
AppleBloom, I forgot how many times I died... And tbh, the ending wasn't worth it.
Ninjazz: yeah.......... I know lol
Does anyone ever go to gamestop (or wherever you purchase games) and just buy the worst/cheapest you can find just for a good laugh?
Cheap=/=bad
Some games are too underrated
Nier for example
Nier <3
I like Nier's music. Can't say anything for the game.
Ninjazz: It try to shy away from tween heroes
Java: I bought a game called stranglehold, long story short your jackie chan with dual wielding pistols that can slow time down and its called 'Tequilla mode'
Java, I have heard that.
AppleBloom: yep, finished that game too. I love every second of it.
OOPS
Java: se...seriously? I laughed my butt off the whole time I played that game
AppleBloom: I love Chow Yun Fat and his movie Hard Boiled.
Also crotch shots :p
Java: are we talking just crotch shots in general?
Yes :p
Java: oh well yeah, who doesn;t like them?
Pootis?
!cd
Episode 8 of season 3 "Apple Family Reunion" airs in 1 days, 3 hours, 29 minutes, 4 seconds (Dec 22 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
Slowmotion + crotchshots = hilarity
Tom: Is best updater
Java: Diving crotch shots, then rolling on cart in slow mode
AppleBloom: absolutely.
So let's see if they're going to throw pandas at the AJ fans tomarrow.
Okay I need to cook my dinner, brb in 1 hour.
still online though
dinner? where on earth do you live?
its 4:00 am for me lol
Java, Indonesia :p
oooooh, Hi indonesia!
7 PM here
Hello AppleBloom :)
ok brb
kk
Phase4: Each time. Bomb Explodes.
I just one of my talking buddies... I am sad now :'(
lost one*
Well I must part but before I go
I must say
Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/45bf91b2aa13196787dd13980d54342b.png it's not easy being regal...
Has Weak PC. Wants to play TF2
if you watch any episode without thinking about the fandom
there is no fan-pandering
think about it
anyway
au revoir mes amis
CrystalPhoenix: err okay lol
CrystalPhoenix: later!
CrystalPhoenix: Crystals speaking in fancy! Night though
Trixie's episode sure does confirm that. But not at the level everyone's crying about. But yeah. There's definately no pandas.
MadSurge, my queen.
Ninjazz: Well obviously there's gonna be a fandom episode here and there, but give it time and people will claim it to be just another regular episode
so wait, how many episode there going to be this season?
00,02you guys seeing this lag right?
00,02AppleBloom, 13
AppleBloom, I blame this season's feel. There's a damn reason people are crying about pandas. It's just as bad to ignore as well to exagurate it.
Yes. I do.
Phase4: is it like a mid season break and then they continue to 26? or are they gonna be wierd by ending oddly
00,02no, 13 episodes
There's rumors about a movie length episodes, but nothing sure
Phase4: What is causing the Game lag?
Phase4: well that stinks >.> I wanted another 26 episodes on netflix lol
00,02Uboa-San, not a clie
00,02clue'
wow
that was same seriously bad lagg
Off-Air now.
hai everypony ^^
The ponies being shown, are they the OC'S of the sites admins? (Excluding characters obviously within the show)
hi Invi
Ohai Invi.
Invi: you missed the end of the world party we had going on here, where were you?!
isn't the end of the world in 4 hours?
that's what they said in tv
wait, here was a party?
IDK ghosties was counting down. and according to Java, its 7pm where he's at. Idk if thats still yesterday or today so I think it's already passed
what will be today's movie from movie night?
Invi: Well no not really... But we called it a party
anyways... Ninjazz, do you have a good fanfic to suggest? :3
i hear funny noises outside..
Invi, adventure? Romance? Comedy? Heart of a Dragon?
I would suggest a friend of mines, but he writes messed up stuff o.O
>_ >
<_ <
Ninjazz: can you suggest a romance to me?
Ninjazz, what do you mean with heart of a dragon?
AppleBloom, Heart of a Dragron. But it REALLY depends on your favorite shipping. I just that one because it's one of the best written ones I've read.
Invi, my personal favorite.
I shamelessly say that one if you ask.
Every time.
Ninjazz: do you have one via octavia or lyra, they my fav background :3
hm okay i'll try it ^^
thankies Ninjazz ^^
AppleBloom, if you like lyra, try anthropology
AppleBloom, well...I did start off with an Octavia one called Sketchy Salad Synphony. I never finished the ending chapter though.
Invi, no problemo.
okidoki I shall.
Ninjazz: ooh send link, I wish to read your work
AppleBloom, I didn't write it. Did I say I did?... Oops.
no you didn't ^^
/me diabolically shuffles hands... You did indeed muahaha
.-.
night all and have a good end of world
nighty night therainbowvortex
nighty therainbowvortex
Right back at you Spectrum Swirl.
I dont think Ninjazz gonna send link
/me curls up in ball and cries
Is there a stream?
nope
Oh. Damn.
hi aniderp|bestcakeever
the world ended xD
so this is our imagination
:P
the world did?
I wish the world had ended, I stayed up too late. Gotta be at work in like 3 1/2 hours
then get a really strong coffee
mocha
espresso
AppleBloom, http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1506/sketchy-salad-symphony there. Next time however, you should go look it up yourself.
screw liquid, eat the coffee
d3rb, my father said, i should better chew coffee beans than drinking energydrinks
Ninjazz: I thought it was a none finished chapter, so I asked for the link because I figured it was none published
those things are junk so yeah he's probably right
yeah, probably ^^
AppleBloom, oh. Welp. It's been done. For months.
Ninjazz: also, my jaw just hit the floor from seeing all the views, upvotes and words
the end of the worled!!!!!
Like I said (or at least I think I said), it was a good one. I hope you don't mind OCs though.
Ninjazz: Nah i love OC's infact. I made you own story with mine and it didn't go over near as well as yours xD
00,02http://derpy.me/kW6Jd
AppleBloom, I DIDN'T MAKE IT.
Ninjazz: okay, it didn't go over as well as the person who made this story. Thank you for sharing it with me
Phase4 fix the plugin
AppleBloom, hope you enjoyed the read as I did.
00,02JRP2234, but that requires work :')
enjoy*
00,02i meen :'(
00,02stupid keyboard
Happy Phase, sad Phase.
Phase4 i needs me derpy thingy workingy

bah! I gotta go to bed :'( Night everybody!
night AppleBloom
dont epxplode applebloom
Ninjazz, have you actually written an own story?
aniderp|bestcakeever: I'm trying, but its proving rather difficult
Invi, I have. Never uploaded.
why?
i have written stories but never finished them
Don't want to. It's written, that's all I cared about. That was like...months ago.
years ago..
never finihsed
7,000 wii u's got stolen

xD
Only?

lol, someone fucked up big time then
00,02...why?
i would get the black one ofcourse
00,02what would you do with 7000 wii u's
idk

00,02JRP2234, 7000 of them?

gumtree or ebay
00,02how do you even make off with that many, did they bring a truck or what
http://au.ign.com/articles/2012/12/19/7000-wii-u-consoles-stolen-in-airport-robbery?abthid=50d1af3c41c13de865000067
00,02if those ever touch the internet nintendo will instantly know
How?
00,02"Adventurous thieves [...]" << true dat
08,01well, i think we can successfully say
"BREAKING NEWS: New store opens in Seattle, only sell Wii U's....." best comment in that article :D
08,01earth: 1
08,01mayans: 0
yay
00,02Ninjazz, the wii had per-console encryption, these keys (or something similar) are used to authenticate with the nintendo store
00,02"The robbers loaded the consoles onto trucks using the warehouse's forklifts sometime between 9pm on Saturday night and noon on Sunday and made off with them."
00,02what the heck
and then sell it on evay :D
*ebay
Phase4, and they can pin point each one that's been stolen and track them? Welp. That's one way of keeping track of their customers.
>_ >
<_ <
"The thieves broke into an air cargo warehouse and made off with 7000 Premium and Basic Wii U bundles worth a total of $2.28million according to Eurogamer's calculation."
lolwut
holy shit
00,02Ninjazz, i don't think its set up for that but they have enough information to do so
>.>
00,02they will be able to differentiate stolen ones, then send off to the police the ip of the stolen console
00,02it's not rocket science
Course not.
Well, justice be done.
so, how bout them ponies
shh
its wii u talking thing
shh
the fuck are you on about
7000 sii u's got stolen
wii*
I know >_ >
I was here for that
so you stole it case solved
I wish
I could make millions, and still have the console I want
its funny because they might actual get away with it
that would be awesome
Phase4 theres thinder
/me is getting Dishonored today
were not ded
lies
then ded
the world ended
we're all dead
/me is dead
night Phase4 remeber my babys are yours

i know right, ponies
The white and purple one is the best.
pink energetic is best
though, spike is best pone
dj horse is my favourite
purple dragon is best pony
purple smart is worst pony
I like how we degenerated into 4chan
you mean this isnt /mlp/?
>implying that's a bad thing
oshit.
isn't it? ^^
thos crazies thinking the world would end still alive
Ninjazz: because it is a bad thiing
what if the world doesn't die but become a zombie?
*thing
why would a planet become a zombie?
because it's full of brainless people ^^
hmm
cowvarkian, I'd think otherwise. It'd be a lot more interesting in here.
Ninjazz: thats nice
the taliban will make a bio wepon that will cause it to happen
djblazekin: you give them too much credit
that al qida and nkorea and iran
taliban isn't al qaeda >_ >

i'm not a nintendo fan i'm sony 100% besides sony is better than microsoft by 20%
You're a twat.
what has microsoft to do with that?
pfft, who knows
/me sits in corner
microsoft is trying to be nintendo
/me gives aniderp|bestcakeever food
djblazekin: lolwhat
And you're trying to be smart.
what? how so?
Quit trying.
how is microstoft trying to be nintendo?
they aren't
Well, both companies do need to get their heads out of their asses.
Or burned down in an inferno. Same thing.
oh you
hey micro$oft is shoving the kinect down our throats with every game just about
no one is forsing people to buy kinects
Yes because they're clearly holding a gun point to our head to buy Kinect and their games.
if you don't like it, don't buy it
You bloody twat.
forcing**
look at most 360 titles they say better with kinect it's bs
djblazekin: I'm not buying those
this has what to do with nintendo?
bs?
apparently
alsao you said your a sony fanboy, why do you care?
d3rb: because he's a sony fanboy
but im a sony fanboy and i give a shit
mostly aiming tward the soccermoms and wii owners with casual games

Aye
I like shrimp
I honestly don't know what the hell either
besides ms cancelled ki 3 and told rare to make games for the kidds they start work on an animal care sim and that gets shot down yet ms has them releasing the sports minigame packs
hi MadSurge
its not the end of the freakin world:[
And yet you still go on yet no-one gives a shit.
djblazekin: cool story bro
Ohai Invi!
No srsly. Can we go back to ignoring this shit? That hurt my eyes less.
If you don't like it, don't look.
Good thing I don't have to look at your face then, Joomay.
No but your mother has to.
DashWithRainbows: womp womp womp
awwwwww
lels.

has anyone played djmax
no i use real turntables
Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/263e6f6565c8fd8e60b194ede2d55518.jpg something for your sore eyes then <3
Well that worked.

Jmo, dont feed it
I'm not feeding shit you twat.
ok...
>not feeding
>giving attention
>attention is feeding it
cowvarkian, Go back to 4chan.
Jmo: never been on 4chan
epic random moment comeing up... YES THE WORLD HASNT ENDED!
yes it has
So you're a sheep.
Bravo.
Holy shit. Will the world just end.
this is now thwe matrix
i love and tollerate but when it comes to consoles its war
Pfft.
I'm done.
Shine on Bronystate, shine on.
Added to the bloody list.
so, I can't remember, is Jmo this much of an asshat all the time, or just right now
Only when he's pissed at people.
I'm not pissed.
jmo would be boring any other way
Jmo: so why are you being so pissy?
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzedJZzmAMc
I'm not being pissy.
sure you're not
You should really learn what pissy is.
uh huh
cool story
jmo just has low tollerance for stupid, right?
Keep trying cowvarkian.
Phase4: burgerpaul ftw :D make sure you watch all of his "I broke ..." videos :D
Jmo: thats nice
00,02Alchemist, i have :)
d3rb, if that's the case, why is he here so much? >_>
just like pinky pie being hyper is normal but as pinkamena depressed state we all know where that goes
hmmmm, good point Ninjazz
I'm here in hope that the chat actually gains intelligence.
Jmo: thats funny
Not near the goddamn week ends, that's for sure.
you will be the smart bringerer
My point is proven even more.
hey jaymoo you think im smart? o.O
*cough*
do you think bullete proof windows and armed faculty keep schools safe
israel seems to think so
well we aren't constantly in a war with our neighbors
also, we don't have rockets shot at us every day
Not yet, Canada is long overdue for an invasion
they were fairly succesful last time
when they burnt down DC
yeah but every two years or so a mass shooting accures
djblazekin every two years?
there were like, 5 this year
00,02whats really disturbing about those shootings is what people blame
finish this sentence djblazekin, Bullet proof windows stop shootings because....
the mall
00,02everyone runs around saying 'this cause it, its that video game, arragafgsagf'
00,02no one ever seems to thing that the guy who is at fault is the one who shot people
they cant breake in
People like blaming objects because objects can't argue back. Too afraid to blame a person.
bullets kill people
the bullets that people fire from guns
the person who has the gun with bullets kill :\
Phase4: since it is a common occurence now, people look at patterns. And the most obvious one is that all incidents included guns :D
Phase4: And the Westboro jerks are saying "Oh, God toldm him to do this because of all of the gay people and gay supporters" or some crap like that.
HAPPY DOOMSDAY EVERYPONY!
Ninjazz: guess I'm careless then, because I always call the shooters "that asshole"
String_Shredder: lel wat
Hi rdibp!
hey rdibp
00,02String_Shredder, yeah but thats westboro, i honestly dont give a crap about anything they say
if someone killed me because im lesbian.. that is a hate crime :\
pdidr yeh
*pbidr
MadSurge, get on the news.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIY41LrvMFQ
thats cool naikravwoc
No seriously. I haven't heard one person blame the guy.
thats because the guy was mentally ill and people usually blame the illness and not the person. Its quite common.
one real people, or just TV people
Death Pony is best pony
yea thay always blame games and guns but not the person
Ninjazz: my mom always says "if they're so eager to kill why don't they shoot themselves first"
hah
Well IF ONLY.
Ikr
00,02another big problem is a lot of people honestly think its as simple as 'ban guns'
MadSurge: because they want to hurt others?
00,02thats whats happened here, there was a lot of knifings, so they baned knives, there are still a lot of knifings
cuz half the murderers kill themselves after the rampage despite either way the burn in hell
asking "why kill others" in these situations is pointless.
00,02and yes, we have laws against pointy things in victoria, its quite silly
pointy things...
Alchemist: the bad thing is that they often commit suicide at the end, so why don't they skip the shooting innocents part
my school was just on tv talking about someone bringing a gun to school
we are not allowed to bring backpacks
Phase4, are they going to ban sticks in the near future?
00,02Ninjazz, i wouldnt put it past them
Lel.
lel
MadSurge: thats assuming they think rationally. In their mind killing others and ragequitting is a perfectly logical procedure...
00,02whats really funny is the way they class weaponry, i don't have the details but suposedly a japanese katana ends up being clasafied the same as a kitchen knife
lawl
lwal
00,02so you can legally carry one around
Here any knives which are longer than 4 inches are illegal to wear. Switchblades are illegal regardless of size.
Ninjazz: you must have a license here to have a gun and there are still a lot of hate crimes here. Still, not many mass shootings
seriously they might as well have up naked cuz anyone can kill anyone with just about anything
00,02but if it is a sword, then you need a licence
00,02djblazekin, i'm prety sure i could do damage even if naked
00,02they'd have to ban motion entirely
I'm sure it'll happen eventually
Just be buff enough or hit people with a big enough object
Putting a ban on guns will not put a stop to crime. Shooting up a bank can land you in prison so whats the difference of if guns are illiega;
00,02rdibp, thats exactly what people dont get
00,02no one accounts for black markets
don't they just want to renew the ban on assault weapons?
exactly with just the guies hand he killed a perve who was sexually assaulting his daughter bare fist
00,02which are verry real things
MadSurge, I'm still uncertain if banning weapons ever solves the problem. Problem being getting people to shut up. Even if weapons are banned and crimes happen less, they ARE going to happen. Maybe not as controversial but it's going to happen and people are going to complain.
00,02banning weapons won't solve anything
Ninjazz: no law in the world will make certain crimes disappear. The point is to lower the occurence.
Good afternoon everyone :)
Alchemist, the cycle will just continue.
00,02afternoon MLP_Brovakiin
hai MLP_Brovakiin
00,02and then you have the psychological effects of banning, ever read about the alcohol prohobition?
cant wait till the new ep
Ninjazz: Im sure they will happen one way or the other, but will there be less or more?
00,02djblazekin, neither can i :3
MadSurge, that would help. But would that help everyone? I wouldn't think so.
Alchemist, that's the plan.
Phase4: no need to, I already know how it went :D
djblazekin: but the mayans arent though
Alchemist, less, misread.
Ninjazz: besides, seeing how it comes down to cultural differences, I cant really argue about this.
Ninjazz: it's just that anyone can point a gun and shoot, but less people have the nerve and the guts to knife someone :D
i heard something about allowing firearms to teachers
00,02what seems to be happening here is because knives are banned, having one becomes a status symbol
Pfft
hmm
MadSurge, well I've always thought that a person has a right to defend himself at least. Having a gun, knife or whatever shouldn't be taken away from himself if he wants to be safe.
probably
Alchemist, it is hard to argue about. Since one thing that works in one place doesn't seem to work in another or doesn't flat out work at all.
00,02^^^^^^^^^^^
Ninjazz: I dunno, all I have is a better lock on my door :D (also plenty of kitchen knives if needed"
heck in japan only military and police can have guns the rest of cociety well have thier tools
Ninjazz: that too
00,02this kind of thing is very sensetive to culture, one population would reject prohibition, another would acceptr
00,02accept it'
and i feel my colour is distracting
good
because it is
I like colours though :)
09,02M03,02a06,02d04,02S07,02u08,02r09,02g03,02e06,02,04,02 07,02o08,02 09,02r03,02l06,02y04,02?
saw that coming :D
according to som nuthead on fb the zombies will rise on the 22nd

Are you okay?
No. He just feels the need to are pee in chat.
Starring Gweneth Paltrow as jmoo
I have a really good immune system but once it gets infiltrated I get deathly sick
Is the stream automated or is someone actually streaming this?
<__<
/me slaps String_Shredder around a bit with a large trout
look at me everyone I'm Kipkat07_Scarf pls giv me a10shun kthxbai
I'm pretty sure is automated.
/me cant read leetspeak
ohh... okay
nvm
*l331p34k
Kipkat07_Scarf: You probably can't triforce either.
wat
Because there is a mlp marathon right now on the hub.
/me never used AOL
:O STREAM IT!
Also djblazekin, you do realize that the point of bringing new streamers on is to improve the site quality, not degrade it, right?
I know, I don't get the hub.
but some mod here does....
I should watch ponies, I hear it cures everything
i dont have the hub either :'(
I have no words.
hey guys
if i had the hub i would never visit bronystate and that would be sad
well, apparently Link saved us all once again
Kipkat07_Scarf: Cartoons cannot have healing properties. Sorry.
They can make you feel happy.
well actually they can heal on a psychical level
String_Shredder: i heard that the rate of heart attacks and diabeetes went up since season 3 aired
...true story
so what have you guys been up to
getting a mod to stream hub right now
hey i also have metal gear hd collection and mortal kombat along wit c o d bo declassified among some psp titles and ps1 titles like parasite eve and crash bandicoot warped
Well I have bunch a snow in my front yard.
same here
Swiftheart: you're saying it like its a bad thing
I have a bunch of ice in my yard...
:3
I cant watch ponies on hub because I force myself to 3 eps per week on bronystate. If I watch too many episodes, I'll become bored and desensitized to MLP.
i have a bunch of grass in my yard :'(
I dont have a yard
rdibp: most do
I'm sick so I can't do anything
:(
i have a bunch on ponies on my tv
Swiftheart: join the club :3
i want to see snow one day :(
rdibp: Google is your friend
/me used to live in florida and didnt know what snow was like till he moved to Utah for a year and a half
Swiftheart: have you noticed all the people getting sick recently? THIS IS HOW IT BEGINS! :O
people catching a cold when waiting for aliens?
NOOOOOO
a lot of kids at my school werre sick
including me
Inb4 S3 is cancled
Pfft
ping me when someone decides to stream. I'm back to borderlands now
/me would kill himself if that happened
Jake
DerpyMuffins it already began :3
thats idiotic
Jake
ekaJ
I have severe emotional problems and three doeses of pony per week keeps me stabel
*stable
meh ok then
what have I gotten myself into...
Could you stream the MLP marathon on the hub?
Mood swings?
There just arn't any words.
no, just inferiority complex. I have a huge ego to protect myself from my failures
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVmB3lRjCmc something relevent :3
lel no
lel yes?
lel maybe
:-D
lol
I actually leveled myself off when I became a brony and now I have ponies to help increase my happiness levels and reduce stress
/me is awesome
thats interesting
/me is better than you at history
/me doubts this
^ my ego
its been a good year http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAOyypPvSM
I bet that depends on whose history you're talking about.
:P
I have actually stalemated a history debate with my vice principal who was a history teacher. Not a bad start
ask me a history question. I must train myself.
ScootaChicken: Spotted dick is quality.
I asked my principal if he was a brony.
Kipkat07_Scarf: where was derp when herp was derping?
That was earlier in the year though
Kipkat07_Scarf: Tis a shame that no one here actually cares then.
rdibp: 42
CORRECT!
/me rolls in his now inflated ego
/me pops Kipkat07_Scarf 's ego with a pin
/me rolls in his already quite large ego
the fire of friendship lives in our hearts (cont...)
the fire of old episodes live in youtube (cont...)
/me rolls over cowvarkian and crushes him under his ego that he patched up with a pony band-aid
hmm
hello

NPR said it might be in 2016 or 2020
around de woooorrld, around de world around de world
oi science
The Little Prince made me cry when I was a kid (about 6-7).
oi cachi01
wat about u stop trying to guess the end of the world
and mind ur ow fakin business
NPR is best radio
in april 13 2029, there might be an asteroid that will hot us, but it might not happen
the world will end when our sun becomes a red giant
oh shit
...in 5 billion years
rdibp: and by might, you mean won't
its gonna take like a billion years for the sun to go out
BRB
Wrek It Ralph is coming out this weekend! :$
dont worry well be dead long before that
stop trying to predict it
MadSurge: dvd right?
its impossible
Kipkat07_Scarf: lel
i believe the end of the world, but its not going to happen in my lifetime
i m really interested how will world looks like in 2600 year :D
all fucked up
It's a shame you'll be dead.
it will be a dead planet by then
lel the painful truth
>2600
>fucked up
Lel
Pfft
the hell is lel
MadSurge: wow a bit late lel

We're going to be around a lot longer than that unless we get unlucky with a meteor.
cachi01: better late than bever
so has anyone here read leauge of extrodrinry gentlemen
alexxm: i really dont fucking know lel
I'm just waiting for Galactus to eat the earth.

Kipkat07_Scarf: What the fuck are you talking about?
nightwatchman: meh the avengers will save us
rdibp going out the way he lived
Ninjazz: Why?
*turns a page of playpony*
oi i want that magazine
so anyone read league of extrordriny gentlemen
cachi01 or the fantastic four.
alexxm: watched the movie lol
cachi01 what did you think of it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB_sZA2pJdc
Ninjazz youre right
MFW people say they want the world to be destroyed
in this form we wont be able to exist too long. We are using more rescources for energy than the earth can provide it for us. Once we run out of energy well be back in the stone age.
for no raisen :)
alexxm: i think it was good. the little i remember about it
MFW they're all talking bullshit and would be crying their eyes out if it were to come about
Unless you're literally a total mental case who will one day snap and kill 30 people you don't want the world to end.
Enough pessimist talk guys :|
Alchemist: well no matter what we o we are all going to die, so lets wreck the place and party
do*
I just want people to shut up.
and then commmit suicide
Yep
Seriously, why even say that?
rdibp: but let's not leave a mess, ok? :D
You don't want the world to end.
rdibp: meh.
god.........why the fuck did that asshole killed those kids.
cachi01: because he did
You don't wish for the deaths of your entire family, all of friends, and every human being on this planet.
cachi01: Because humans are horrible creatures.
wow, adobe crashe for some reason
crashed*
rdibp: it crashes about 2-3 times a day for me. you just get used to it.
I told you why. Don't act like that when I told you why.
rdibp saved ?
/me goes on an adventure to find adobe in Nairobi
you wont find adobe
HERE IN NAIROOOOOOBIIIIIIIIIII
You told me why?
put they do have spectacular hotels :$
Yep.
Because you 'want people to shut up' is good reason for the decimation of the entire human race?
uh
apparently taffy
/me is sad because Neil Armstrong died this year
rdibp: http://scratch.mit.edu/static/projects/asicthehedgehog/2361465_med.png but we sure have great hedgehogs!
In a hyperbole way, yeah.
*hyperbolic
Besides, we'll kill each other off soon enough.
In my personaly opinion, humans need to learn how to use our inteligence
hah, no
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwYKKTGBDlU
*saying hah no to Ninjazz not Rocket
Well now you're saying it was hyperbole, before you were just saying 'I want to see the world burn'
Thanks for making that clear, cowvarkian.
and that guy from Armeggedon
nightwatchman good idea
 
Which conveys that it's exaggeration in what way?
so... star wars episode 7. anybody excited?
lel
suck the planet
lel
lelel
lele
Oh god... I just realized... I SOUND LIKE A HIPPIE!!! *screams nooooooo!*
shut up with the lel or your not going to disney world
You said it. I don't wish the deaths of the entire world to come to pass. I just want people to shut up about it not happening. And maybe stop being stupid for a good few minutes.
sounds good
You were willing to read between the lines, weren't you?
Man of Steel comes out this summer. the trailer is amazing! I cried a little.
aaaaaaand i cant die yet
