my favorite welsh word thus far is ystafell
Figured as much, aha. Quebec City? Montreal? St. Donat?
ver, it was artificially contrived in the 1860s as a publicity stunt, to give the station the longest name of any railway station in the United Kingdom.
It's crazy hard to pronounce
Wat, welshmen, just wat
@Dave_BroZilla:Province of Quebec
*province
The longest word in the Swedish language is according to Guinness World Records Nordöstersjökustartilleriflygspaningssimulatoranläggningsmaterielunderhållsuppföljningssystemdiskussionsinläggsförberedelsearbeten (130 letters). It means "Northern Baltic Sea Coast Artillery Reconnaissance Flight Simulator Facility Equipment Maintenance Follow-Up System Discussio
(@pegacorn, that was)
queleues queleues
Ystafell is hard to pronounce, Dman
12wB
at least french is fine
The longest usual word in French is anticonstitutionnellement (25 letters), meaning "anticonstitutionally" (in a way which is not conforming to the constitution).
It's like... ridiculously far from how it's spelled
WTF TURKISH
Muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmişsinizcesine	Like you would be from those we can not easily/quickly make a maker of unsuccessful ones

Found the full list
well, there's daylight savings time to make things confusing
If you assume GMT is GMT and not BST you always come out the smartest :p
again?
That's what's nice about GMT: It cares not for silly mortal things like Daylight SAvings.
Was nice knowing you, Combustile
There's actually lots of time zones that do that

hi NewManiac
Hello NewManiac!
10espylacopa the thing is that a lot of people mistake things like GMT and BST, and you have to assume that when people say GMT they mean 'British Time at the moment'
Just because people use it interchangeably doesn't mean it's correct.
/me looks downwards and sees a gian Gummy-bot
I don't assume.
*giant
10Yes but you have to realise that a lot of people do
That does not mean it's correct though
