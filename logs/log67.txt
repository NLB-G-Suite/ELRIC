Baww
Brb, need to take care of something
My pool is around 11ft deep xD
I used to dwell too much on getting my happiness online. I've started spending more time online since ponies, mainly because of BronyState, so I guess that's not a great thing, since I've stopped going out friday and saturday nights now >.>
12I wish Danny was around to see that joke D:
/me 12hidesa
/me breaks HML's leg in response to breaking her iPod
12-a
I wish I had a pool
14'kay Sky, how do I do this then? So we can battle
0w
12o-o
14I don't see anything that says battle
In fact, come to think of it I've really neglected some people since BronyState D:
0apokalipse, y ... you know what i'd rather not say
10Uh
7told you it was hard
7:)
As soon as I get home, I want to learn how to use PO

aw
7yep
Ah
14oh okay
0even harder with like 10FPS when too many zombies

That's why you need to pick Torchic at the start :(
10Type '91.121.255.156:5080' in the Advanced Connection box to connect to the TST server
0hah,a but sadly it's just yer regular rugby stadium : /
/me 's ears perk up

10For using caps 3 times in a row
10WTF

10That needs to be changed lol
14Holy crud my team has got to be good then
10I didn't take the time to get good IVs or anything, so yeah
10Competitive battling is meh
inb4 shocking revelation
0rainbrodash give me NOW
IVs make me faceplam in general
Whiich is why you won't see me on PO any time soon :3
Dman and sathi 'TehDavies' who just added you is me
0yea figured as it came in 3 secs after i asked xPO
06No one says it has to be competitive.
ok first off i'm sorry
ABOUT WHAT? ;_;
(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
06If anything I'll probably end up trying to make veeon teams or something silly like that :p
14I just did what I normally do for Pokemon lol
being an ass and spamming linkz
10A team full of Espeon only
wat
10Glorious
06That would be unfairly overpowered though.
06:U
/me dies
I got banned remember/
10lmao
?
14Okay so, note to self
Ohlol I didn't realise you did
14GET A TEAM LIKE I JUST MADE UP
But welcome back. Was it a week?

Hi Rora

14and then go up against Xeli
14!espeon
minecraft may leave me completely mental after 1.8 updates
/me now belongs to May for 17 minutes

07D:
14Individual Values
not me, nope
12ohai Kyu
I wasn't there, so... no?
14Amazing things
06IV's are Pokemon DNA pretty much
anyone who plays minecraft
06I always looked at it that way at least
7so I died :(
have you heard of the new mob yet?
14Leave out Leafeon
7watching dman in action now
06And EV's as the results of training
07Flareon
14no one pays attention to it
06NO
Hot
0u mean fail
6enderman
6the new fear

0srsly
0it's refreshing 5 times a second!

07Flareon has high attack but there aren't any good physical fire moves it can learn
07o3o

06Flareon

6yeah that's the point
6but read the monster's bio
under Locke Randolph
14Kyu, that's a good point
06inb4 videos of it stealing diamond blocks
14But Flare Blitz and Flame Charge?
06And that is of course a good point but I like Flareon |D
6I'm TERRIFIED of that thing lol

06everybody wins
anyway they'res also this great vid on youtube called [MMD] Possibly the 3rd most retarded thing you've seen today?
07and of course I like Flareon too
07IT'S SO FLUFFY
14...Endermen no
need to reboot now before it's too late
0why do you need to reboot?
14So, I started playing Minecraft

7ohai :)
0nice
14I hate night time in Minecraft
14scary growly noises
0i don't think i can run l4d2 very well, but i guess i'll still play it
6zombies
14And I got slammed in a jungle
14so
6otherwise it's quiet
14actually now

14not a jungle

damn
Back
14wb
Can you play with PC players if you get L4D for the 360?
14also, the terrain my world happens to be in
Nope
inb4 PILLZ
FOOTBALL!YEAH!
brb,gotta take some of my things back upstairs.
14it's like some stupid island thing
14island hopping
14everywhere
damn
0robotpinkie, nah
0yea...
14There's pools of water, and the jungle stuff, then random cows/sheeps
14I found a pig, but I killed it hoping for some pork
14It didn't work
Baaaaahhhhh
Microsoft tested PC vs Xbox for multiplayer gaming, but PC players destroyed Xbox players so hard (even in casual vs casual) that it wasn't a viable system to implement
6yeh some pigs wont give pork
Thanks May
0rainbrodash - dat MW2 video
Go smash the walls for pork!
Well, yeah, but L4D is cooperative, right?
Castlevenia reference
0'oh my gooood. oh my gooood! he's such a wallhacker. JUSTLEMTEKILLYOU#
0hahaha
and since multiplayer fps is like the 2nd biggest money earner in gaming, that makes it not worth it to do it at all
14I think it's amazing that the human can use its bare hands to take down trees and break holes in the wall
14I wouldn't be able to do that
Sony allowed it for Portal 2, though.
i got cut by an ice cube a few days ago, and therefore i am mortal
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnZvrjv1_JI
0view. profit with lulz.
07I can.
yeah robotpinkie, but imagine the crying on the forums if only certain games got xbox-pc link :P
i'm back
/me flees
0robotpinkie - more like valve did it but yea
Lol, bootlegged Android tablet :P
07granted, it has to be really young trees and thin walls
14Lol Kyu
07but still
/me flees louder
/me 7prays for a weekend sale on killfloor
Well Valve did the implementation, but that's kind of useless if not allowed.
0Sathi - friend gets it for like 4$ offer, then says its good so i get for 20, then summer sale and it's 5 again
!espeon
:3
/me now belongs to Link for 17 minutes
0WHY MEEE
And I don't really see much crying on PS3 forums over Portal 2
and stuff
0also, sathi, i love that game nad it runs fine! : P
Sathi it was so cheap before, you really missed out ;P
Xbox 360 sucks in my opinion.
7yer I know
oh god, console war here we go
7instead I got left4
lol I love all consoles.... except the Wii :P
i got the old one and itz SO AWESOME
0Wii is best teehee
7wii follow up looks interesting
No consoles suck. There.
I don't like the Wii either
right There
0Wii U mad?
.
The Wii is pretty good
Wii U looks cool.
The Wii doesn't suck. All the games since 1 year after release suck
All of them have things that the others don't.
Even Mario Galaxy 2?
also: the new zelda should be released on gamecube not wii :P
eh, most of the good wii games are the ones made by nintendo itself
Well, Wii is pretty much for first party titles, as far as I'm concerned.
and yeah barry I dislike both mario galaxys
Won't happen
0rainbrodash, wat
mario, zelda, smash bros, etc
0metroid!
dman, they suck. just face it
i like crimson skies
:P
I don't like Mario Galaxy.Mario is overrated nowadays.
Skyward Sword requires the Wii Motion Plus
i'll get a 3ds when more games come out for it, excited for paper mario
Nintendo Power sucks nowadays.
0Rainbrodash, how bout no. MG1 beat COD4 in reviews
0ofc, reviewers suck but he
>implying reviews mean shit
0Nintendo Magazine, in UK. and it's awesome
0Thats what i said rainbrodash
0but eh i like 'em
lol
i upgraded all planes and now i got excess like 54 upgrade tokens after beating like 3 times
They do
Pony console wars!
wait a sec
Also: WHY DID THE WII PAPER MARIO SUCK SO HARD ;_;
I think Pong was an awesome game console.
All reviews are is word of mouth that something is going to be either good or bad
0the nintendo sixtypony is the best nintendo
They just say:"OMG it Nintendoh so it awsum." or "OMG nut Nintendoh so it sukz."
The N64 one - GREAT. Thousand Year Door: AMAZING. Oh, sick, a good Wii game since Twilight Princess, sweet OH NO WAIT THIS SUCKS
0that's a magazine for ya
I mean the accuracy you got with the pong controller is unrivalled even today!
By the way, Nintendoh is a fan-created flash episode
0RainBroDash
0lemme find you a legendary post
0about zelda games
0anticipate it i'll brb 1 min
kk :3
Also not to stoke the flames, but Pong > Space Invaders
if people didn't know RBD is a zelda fanboy: http://i.imgur.com/izGg7.png
I was talking about Nintendo Power's noobish fanboy reviews.
Zelda games are great, well, most of them. I will admit they dropped the bball with TP
zoom in on the gamecube :3
ball*
lol pong
I gree barry, but I liked the game anyway
0ok found just uploading to the world wide ponyweb
agree*
Nice Battlestation, RBD
They cut out a lot of stuff that would make the game unique
0Razyn wait till you see the ninjamote
Suddenly, Razyn. and ty :>

Not sure if it's better than OoT, doesn't really matter to me
both are awesome
Oot?
my favorite game is still super mario world
Ocarina of Time
dat new one/
I think OoT is boring(again,just my opinion)
0>what is OoT >yes i know what a videogame is.
WW was good actually, but could have been better if they didn't try to stay within the assigned release date
Fukken LOL Dman
If they had pushed it back, they could have made it better
0yo rainbrodash imma let you finish and all, but http://i.imgur.com/klDsI.jpg
or worse

we won't really know
0lol razyn
I dunno, I see very few flaws in WindWaker
still awesaome digrahm
0WW is amazing
world wars/
Only thing that's kinda shit is one of the bosses
Maybe, but they could have done without the triforce quest
That was tedious and pointless
The final form of the shadow puppet boss is annoying as fuck
Moldorm
0barry it was fine if you were in it to explore it all
It's supposed to be annoying
you dare bring light to my lair/
0last boss thou

lets just wait and see if he says anything - if we are saying this is all a troll, then yeah, he was a pretty big troll. But if it's just us misunderstanding, or not giving him the chance to explain at the very least, then I for one would feel like a massive douche...
The Minecraft kind
I'd just hate to accidentally attack someone if it turns out to be true, no matter how implausible.
turns out i am barack obama's illegitimate son, but he paid me not to talk
0if he doesn't respond in any way, i guess he was a troll
0yea robotpinkie same
french hence my stance. Ignoring him is a good idea :L
What are we talking about now?
(turns out the 51 yr old was half royal... was kim royal?)
0alcapony - kim fluttershy possibly lying
anyway I'm going afk to grab some food
we're talking about how you touch yourself at night
That's nice, interior_gummy.
Seeya RBD.
RBD fair play...

Looks like Bane is joining us today!Who knew that the guy that crippled Batman is a brony?
Well, Rainbrodash, I challenge you to slay me in nintendogs spotpass! ha
Twilight
lol yeah basically the story behind that hoody is that my whole school got leavers' hoodies with a personalised name, and I picked n00bsl4y3r because, well, I sl4y n00bs.
fair play razyn, twilight it is ^^
PINKIE PIE FOR EVERYTHING
BEST PONY
Insane pony is insane
Also: hilarity on the day that the shipment of hoodies showed up in the common room. 20 people all scrabbling around going WHERES THE NOOBSLAYER HOODY THIS IS GONNA BE SO AWESOME
Silly gummy! That's not how you spell Twilight Sparkle!
But that's not how you pronounce Pinkie Pie.
stolen meme is stolen
all best ponies are pronounced Rainbow Dash
Ohai Al Capone.
twilight is boring
o hai, Pegacorn.
Well, Pinkie Pie is how you spell Pinkie Pie, and since she is best pony that's how you spell best pony.
14hey Aurora
14how do you get sticks?
anyway, time for fish n chips.
ciao
bai bai rainbrodash
ey wot wot, the bri-ish?

Best Pony = Prince Blueblood
14ohh I just found this giant rock chasym that would most likely kill me if I try and explore it

Undeniably best, because of his doucheness.
Hi ziltoid

Hello, Ziltoid.
prince blueblood is cancer
AlCapony trollan?
Most ego pony in world

Not trollin'. I'd be truthin'.

Cognates are fun
Well, Langue is latin for blood

haha
Apparently
and Natale must mean Natalie Portman
eh?
dave_brozilla ... no?
so, you're draining Natalie Portman's blood in a basement, you sick fiend
It is my native language.
Sangue is blood in french...
its sanguis
in latin
I studied 5 years of latin bro
...I have not
Pegacorn: I'd like to have a French speaker.

I'm trying to brush up on my French after not studying it for roughly four years now.

i know yr is 'the'
when you google "the best pony is" on google images, the first to come up is pinkie pie
and bus is 'BUS
lies
pegacorn donc tu parles francais? :D
my favorite welsh word thus far is ystafell
Figured as much, aha. Quebec City? Montreal? St. Donat?
You RainBroDash
Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, a railway station on the island of Anglesey in Wales, is the longest place name in the Welsh language. 51 letters long in the Welsh alphabet, the name can be translated as "St Mary's church in the hollow of the white hazel near to the rapid whirlpool and the church of St Tysilio of the red cave". How
ver, it was artificially contrived in the 1860s as a publicity stunt, to give the station the longest name of any railway station in the United Kingdom.
It's crazy hard to pronounce
Wat, welshmen, just wat
@Dave_BroZilla:Province of Quebec
what
*province
You so sly
je l'ai pris a l'ecole, mais je ne le parlais depuis quelques quelques mois >.>
The longest word in the Swedish language is according to Guinness World Records Nordöstersjökustartilleriflygspaningssimulatoranläggningsmaterielunderhållsuppföljningssystemdiskussionsinläggsförberedelsearbeten (130 letters). It means "Northern Baltic Sea Coast Artillery Reconnaissance Flight Simulator Facility Equipment Maintenance Follow-Up System Discussio
n Post Preparation Work(s)." Since two words are written together to form new words, multiple words can be put together to make even longer words.[citation needed]
What now robotpinkie?
(@pegacorn, that was)
queleues queleues
C'est correct RainBroDash.
Ystafell is hard to pronounce, Dman
12wB
at least french is fine
The longest usual word in French is anticonstitutionnellement (25 letters), meaning "anticonstitutionally" (in a way which is not conforming to the constitution).
It's like... ridiculously far from how it's spelled
WTF TURKISH
Muvaffakiyetsizleştiricileştiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmişsinizcesine	Like you would be from those we can not easily/quickly make a maker of unsuccessful ones
Pegacorn, so my french wasn't too bad? :3
that ONE WORD means THAT?
Blagvak in Gobbledogook
Means pickaxe to Goblins
haha
Nope RainBroDash,in fact,it was great
12there
12made a small modification
Antidisestablishmentarianism

0Awesome pegacorn. I should really keep up with it, because it would be a shame to let it slip >.> it's been ages since I've had to use it, so I've forgotten a lot
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis

BLACK DYNAMITE

Little Richard, anybody?
http://i.imgur.com/p2ZB0.png
pegacorn :P
Can Faust summon her pony friends to help in the fight?
if she can draw them on the spot, yes
6I checked the "new posts since your last visit"
6nothing there
black dynamite would win, unless ponies
and she has the combined powers of pegasi and unicorns
what if she already has them drawn?
But nunchuks
Then I'd say Faust, because ponies.

Dude, summon luna. bring the moon down on Dymanite
Razyn u so slow pony

That is bullshit! It can't be! It cannot.

8pinakmina: nope
im going to go cut my wrists during the "A" musical crap
the reanimator is my b movie
I have seen nothing from the A movie, so I'm kinda looking forward to it.

The A movie this week is AWESOME
10>people say they're surprised at Across the Universe being the A movie because it's not their cup of tea.

I hope nothing important was in that shed. It's all burned and stuff...
He is now a brony.
lolwut

But I didn't get my Applejack :-(
so what are applejacks and rainbow dashes exactly?
Bronies everywhere. . .

D:
and don't tell me that eqd thingis true w/ canada and all
google is your friend

RainBroDash - it's saturday in Spain : D
/me teleports behind RobotPinkie and hits him.....her....IT in the back of the head downwards towards the shed

Google is conflicted on whether Rainbow Dash is Gay or Not Gay.
what about video linkz now?
10dman, and? :P
Im thinking Bisecual
I say Bi so everyone is happy.
lol sorry too late
Bisexual*
10HuffytheMagicDragon if you need to send a link to a particular person, send it in PM
The third choice however, is "Rainbow Dash is my waifu" according to google.

Holy Celestia it is!
SOCKS?WHAT THE FUCK MAN?

So, no requests tonight?
TFPFfluttershy applejack sounds awesome

Fluttershy is a girly drink, so it's nice to drink it for fun

10espylacopa when people say GMT assume they mean BST
11PM GMT*
/me A giant robot modelled after Gummy slowly raises himself up through the hatch.
/me holds up super fancy leather sock
no it's 10PM GMT
1 hour to go
10combustiblelemons it's 10pm GMT at the moment. 11pm BST.
1 hour according to steam
RainBroDash: Nope, when people say GMT, I assume they /mean/ GMT.
i thought it was a giant pinkie robot
What a sock,Razyn.
i always thought of GMT as current british time, i.e 11pm right now
10espylacopa well I'm advising you not to :P
me too
http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/5953/silvahounddrinksondahou.png
me too scatr
Found the full list
well, there's daylight savings time to make things confusing
I know right! Look Boombox, I found an awesome sock!
and my bad, it's Nightmare Moon that's strong, not Luna
If you assume GMT is GMT and not BST you always come out the smartest :p
again?
That's what's nice about GMT: It cares not for silly mortal things like Daylight SAvings.
I will try them all :D
Hello, bronies.
Was nice knowing you, Combustile
There's actually lots of time zones that do that
equestriadaylightsavings.com
hi NewManiac
Hello NewManiac!
10espylacopa the thing is that a lot of people mistake things like GMT and BST, and you have to assume that when people say GMT they mean 'British Time at the moment'
Just because people use it interchangeably doesn't mean it's correct.
/me looks downwards and sees a gian Gummy-bot
I don't assume.
*giant
10Yes but you have to realise that a lot of people do
They say GMT, that's what I'm going with.
10And stop being so high and mighty about it >.>
go gummy go gummy it ur birthday!
What RBD said.
That does not mean it's correct though
0it's not my birthday though
10Exactly. So realise a lot of people get shit wrong man
He never said it does
arrogance!
/me Mecha Gummy fizzles and stops suddenly, his left eye pops out and thumps into the ground.
10and WORK with it
If im honest theres not many instances where I am confronted with GMT cos people just say 11 oclock
Bah.
lol
It was my birthday 9 days ago D:
lol interior
lololololololololololol
I'm not about to make mistakes just because everyone else wants to.
it would be silly to say GMT in england in everyday conversation
to bad then its ur unbirthday
Ah damn, I was sure I fixed that. :(
aaaaaaaaaaa veryy merry unbirthday to you!
(now in my head forever)
It's been a while since I've been here, so I need to ask: will we be playing random music behind a GIF of Gummy dancing this week?
lol mad hatter
1000 spins
Unbirthday is death?
yes
Idk >.>
gummy dance
10EspyLacpoa congratulations. You're smarter than 90% of the population :P now in order to become smarter than 95% of the population you need to realise that 'being right' isn't always as important as 'working fluidly with all the people who aren't always right' :D
unbirthday = every day that isn't your birthday
no, an unbirthday would be a day that you weren't born on
10also: typo in your name due to fast ragetype :D
ahh ninja'd
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhh
Now your undeathday, that's a special day in any pony's life.

Across the universe is our B-movie.
Well we were getting burned earlier for not greeting Bronies
A-movie*
I missed last week
0no, it's the b movie
RainBroDash: It doesn't bother me as much that you're getting it wrong, it's that youre doing it intentionally. To me, it feels like you're insulting everyone
/me punches RobotPinkie in DA FACE
gah
oh lol
Yep
i got banned last week
sounds terrible :/
Hey! Why you do that for?
not rly
I dunno lol
Forgot the real B movie D:

Evil dead III is the B movie
....and the pony eps too. I think one was best night ever.
Now Pegacorn, that's not very nice.
Ok,i'm sorry RobotPinkie
lol soccer again
It's like, "Oh, they can't learn it, I'll just dumb it down for them so that they don't have to."
Oh right...
It's movie night tonight.
That would explain the 60+ people.

Lol silverscreen. but like so many are UK viewers
keeptrollingtrollingtrollingtrolling
Silverscreen: like a baws
10Silverscreen mfw I bet you don't actually use EST in summer. You use EDT
I found the list: Evil Dead III, then Winter Wrap-up, then sonic rainboom, then across the universe
RainBroDash it's all so confusing!
brb
what across universe bout?
howdy from San Diego UK viewers!
why can't we all use just one time?
Yay sonic rainboom!
Im in England and I just say 20 past 11
the center of my ghetto boombox came out of a GM vehicle
10Ayralynn the list is on the 'HOME' link at the top and bottom of the page :D
11RainBroDash: mfw I don't know the difference. 6_9
and people be waking up at 2am and bed at 8pm, and stuff, but still
10ValtheJean HOWDY! :D
as far as I know it could have been a Chevy
Dman: Because the earth is round.
Idk, I'm going to sleep when across the universe comes on.
:P
Yay! Across the Universe is on of my favorite movies!
:D
EspyLacopa but it would work!
I dun' think I'll be capable of watching Army Of Darkness. I got a 11yo in the room I am in who wants to play Rock Band
Sounds terrible.
0i wonder how many times "yay" will be spammed at the beginning of sonic rainboom
10@EspyLacopa look at what silverscreen said. A lot of people just don't -know- so don't hate them for it, ok?>
i say it like digital its six twenty five
:|
Combustiblelemons... but you've not even seen it yet
over 9000?
inb4 "yay~"
HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE STAND MUSICALS?!
inb4 yay becomes the new toot :P
many yays if its anything like monday
dermatihl_windsor - there's a kid in the room who's playing on the wii and wants me to wear headphones ^_^
yes over 9000
I get bad vibes from movie names.
Huffy, Across the Universe is like Mamma Mia. But with the Beatles.
I predict that the beginning of sonic rainboom will earn a +m rating...
this one seems questionable
rainbrodash hate police now?
0_o
RainBroDash: They aren't the ones that annoy me.
i never saw mama mia
ok i'm back
So will the song for winter wrap-up
but thankz
NYAN
That has to be one of the stupidest things I've heard in the last 10 minutes
(Silverscreen PM)
are we counting the film version of mary poppins as a musical, or is that stretching it too far?
oh god, the implications of winter wrap up! Obviously by winter they mean "cleavage" and wrap up they mean "orgy"
Pegacorn, good. Now try to use your Alicorn magic to fix the world.
i learned the simple WWU on the piano in two days
Huffy, Mamma Mia is a musical made up of songs from Abba.
So how many awards did Winter Wrap Up win for "best song ever"?
0clevage orgy?
0yay
yup :P
lol
0best song in the show is at the gala
Also spam of 'PLOT' and 'Flank'
naw winter wrap up is number one.
brb
0cupcakes also
WWU is best episode
NAw Giggle at the Ghostie
I prefer art of the dress
and the bananas pointed at the melons in the grocery papers are suggstive too
gummy, how do you manage to misspell Cupcakes that badly?
At the Gala is best song.
10EspyLacopa well no-one here is the kind that -does- annoy you, since they just don't know the difference. And from one person who knows to another, I'd say you should think about what the person probably means, instead of being pernickety and/or correcting them. It's alright to be helpful though :>
naw, "Twilight is my bestest friend"

Someone mention cleavage?
Someone remembered Cleavage Orgy! I now feel fulfilled!
so RainBroDash, I've reconsidered your role in the story. I think it works better going in the opposite direction. and did the references do bad things to you?

Alright, Random Trivia time. This movie was released in Japan on the same day the first chapter of "BERSERK" was released. As a result, Kentaro Miura was accused of copying the idea of Ash's automail. In response he claimed it was a very unusual coincidence and that he took the idea from that German knight who had an automail as well.
ArmadaOfDeath, you rock, SO HARD. *brohoof*

RIPOFF FROM THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL
I know something that hasnt been made pony
:O
8o hai applejack
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: 1.	The magic words "Klaatu Barada Nikto", that Ash has to speak when taking the book, were taken word-for-word from The Day the Earth Stood Still - In "The Day The Earth Stood Still" alien visitor Klaatu (Michael Rennie), utters the words to his guardian robot, Gort, to calm him when the robot blindly defends his master against humans.
so what do they do when people die?
11these Magic words that Ash said (Klaatu, Barada, Nikto) are also the names of three aliens on Jabba the Hutt's barge in Return of the Jedi
4Some users don't call me "tsundere" for nothing...

And then they raped him.
You're watching a deranged, one armed man's battle against his six inch clone army.

Ash: The hell, why are there talking horses everywhere. What the hell did I drink?
Anyone made more NewDCD memes?
Yup Ghosties, like one for Playstation which was based on the concept for Evil Dead 4. Not a bad game, either.
We're watching evil dead 3
Dave_Brozilla, fuck yeah Teletoon retro
right?
Dead Nation?
Best thing ever
We need more DCD memes!
can somepony link to the selection entry thread? I can't find it!

6That's what we just watched, yeah.
It's pretty epic. They cut out your brain, heart, and spine first thing.
/me throws Love and Tolerance at Pegacorn
And with Bruce Campbell voice acting
4I think there was also another Evil Dead game for the PS2 and Xbox
Whats next?
halo music?
I hope who wins the lottery picks an animated film!
@brownd they don't do that anymore.
Until I saw ReBoot air alongside Bugs Bunny and Pink Panther

11Axel_Foaley: What channel was it on?
Ah.
Where are the bloopers?

The evil dead game kinda flopped

OH!
Oh yeah, I have the Xbox game. It's not really that awesome, but it does have Bruce.

/me dodges Love and Tolerence
@Pegacorn FOAL, you can't dodge love and tolerance!
Ghosties, Evil Dead, A fistful of Boom stick is one I have. I think there were like three
K then, thanks hipster_brony
4@RobotPinkie: Then it's automatically awesome because it has Bruce
8no problem

who DOES clean up winter?
kinky saddle, Twilight
4Wellll....upload it to tinypic, will you?
I so want to see angsty teenage spike shout at Twilight that she's not his mother. "Don't you take that tone with me young dragon, I brought you into this world and don't think for a second I can't take you out of it!"
6It might be in my mane pony folder.

YOUR NOT MOMMY
The "Mommy?" could have been an obscure Doctor Who reference?
I wonder why Twilight doesn't wear this getup for the rest of the episode
Why do they wear saddles?
No snow outside = Check!
derp
Boots on whooves
Saddles = coats?
NO SNOW
6I'll post it in our thread when I bump it for the last call to get in here for the drawing.

Dat foreshadowing
Biggest animation error ever
/me thinks that Pegacorn seriously needs to let go of his hate.
Why not a coat?
cant they just revome the clouds and let the sun do all the snow-removing work?
Trivia: It's actually march when she does that
dark and early
Winterception
Why not a scarf?
Real men listen to the theme song
Combustiblelemons: So Pinkie can rider her like a cowfilly of course.
