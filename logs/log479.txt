hi rdibp
GilDash: Rarity, Pinkie Pie... I don't really care about the rest.
I can't wish for any new Dashie shipping, because it already happened with everypony in the fucking show.
:\
/me hopes season 3 will have a rainbow dash meltdown
oh well fluttershy is my fave the applejack then pinkie pie followed by rarity then twilight and my least favorite rainbow dash
*then
mario_pony: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0rAmLCx0cF9
Huh.
matter of taste.
/me likes being a Rarity fanboy
im eating cheese at the moment

i hear cheese...
Back with poridge. Man I ahte winter. Im gonna out on a hoodie...
dishwasher_EXTREME: I'm nomming mah toast.
Nom.
cheese then a good coffee = epicness
Ninjazz: She's a very classy pony. ;)
Personally, Rarity is my least favorite, only because I relate to her the poorest - I can see myself in the other 5. Doesn't mean I actively dislike, but... eh.
TheRainbowDash: I would like to see more Rarity and Rainbow Dash moments actually. Never been tried before so it would be interesting.
GilDash: I dislike her, somehow.
Ninjazz: That. So much that. :D
Invi I preder cheese with apple cider :P
TheRainbowDash good give me your toast
hen3ry: I won't kill you in you're sleep then.
LightTrooper105 but that doesn't fit
Ninjazz: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0rAmLCx0cF9
Ninjazz: Already happened with them two, but I guess more is better, but STILL with the Rainbow Dash and the mare shipping..:|
whew
dishwasher_EXTREME: Nope.
Back
Invi fits for me
TheRainbowDash: Who said anything about shipping?
welcome back TheRandomkid321
Ninjazz: ..everypony.
TheRainbowDash give toast NOW
dishwasher_EXTREME: Eh...nope.
Ninjazz: I support Dashie as straight, actually. :p
1. Rainbow Dash 2. Pinkie Pie 3. Twilight Sparkle 4. Fluttershy 5. Applejack 6. Rarity
same here. I don't see any of the Mane 6 as fillyfoolers.
am I the only one whose fav is Twily?
Lunch is done. And I totally support you GilDash :D
TheRainbowDash i killed you once and ill happy to do it again now out with the toast
/me teache GilDash how to do a chokeslam and piledriver
whats a fillyfooler?
Invi: Other than Wreky, then possible yes.
apple jack is by the far most overlooked...poor aj
GilDash: I never saw her as a lesbian as well.
i was playing doom
Invi: you are not alone <3
hen3ry: I think Twilight has potential and might experiment. Rarity possibly. The others are hit or miss really.
Ninjazz: Everypony on the internet did, and the damage had already been done.
wohoo VioletGreySha <3
Applejack dosent even have her own song :(
d3rb: I like Applejack :)
TheRainbowDash Is killed alot.
I never thought RD was from Lisbon
/) DerpSurge
I feel like barking for some reason.....
d3rb: (\
TheRainbowDash: Canon is canon. Don't let fanon get you down.
the internet exploded
/me barks
WOOF WOOG
Ninjazz: I'm just trying to find a good paring for Dash that isn't a mare or a Wonderbolt...
Irish_Pony don't do it
*WOOF
Ninjazz: ....I just see the ponies think differently than me, but I guess you're right.
/me teaches rdibp how to do a chokeslam and piledriver
Irish_Pony it's a trap by the new barking virus
...why?
because i can
Invi: Barking Virus?
Irish_Pony if you bark, it hops in your mouth and gives you the flue
OH WAIT I thoguht we were all bark from a tree
gotta go guys and i dont ill be back any more for the next year
What the hay is barking virus? Infection of dogs?
GilDash: Usually throwing in Rarity makes ANYTHING tolerable for myself. I have problems with Young Spike pairing but Older Spike is good.
Ninjazz: I think Spike and Sweetie Bell actually adorable. :)
Invi: Well Im already sick so theres no point :P
Rarity is my least favorite pony
Ninjazz: I'm fine with any Rarity and Spike shipping.
GilDash: Oh yes, indeed.
Ninjazz: So if I said... Rarity x Spitfire... :$
rdibp: You're completely right.:)
TheRainbowDash: It's just strange.. :S
:$
/me ignores the fools
Irish_Pony ok then go ahead, but remember what happened to the barking pony from ''read it and weep it''
I prefer crack-pairings.
Ninjazz But spike never ages unless he becomes a horder. SO IT WOULD NOT BE CANNON!
GilDash: Wait...
/me glopms Ninjazz in a corner
GilDash: *drools*
Ninjazz: Eh heh heh... :$
Ow.
<:3
GilDash: Ugh, you made Ninjazz drool again..
Owlowishius x Gilda.
Invi: Then Ill just become my platoon mascot :P

A great big expression of happiness

i love fluttershy
^
Ninjazz: I do really love her... :$

And all the usual faces are here :D Invi GilDash Ninjazz Airpuff TheRainbowDash
pony_8304: Well, I can't hate you for that.
Lil_B: Tsk. You know it. ;)
Hey Lil_B!
Lil_B sure. why not? ^^
she just earns to much of the fanbase for being cute
Invi I mean that as a good thing :D
Lil_B: Eeyup, the silly filly hipster regular.:D
02-1 reson to post on tst anymore, lol.
GilDash: I just don't see it... :S
Lil_B: the usual faces? Ofc we're here silly :P
I think I have too much of a thing for Spitfire and Braeburn though. :$
Lil_B you are here too usually ^^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzqapBSj3To&feature=relmfu
pony_8304: i think Rainbow Dash is way too overrated
mario_pony: ...what?!@
02OW
^
:O
02THAT HURT
02;_;
/me starts running in place
well not as much
Get out of the way, TheRainbowDash!
TheRainbowDash: you heard me
:<
Invi yes, even though i don't talk as much as you XD
mario_pony indeed

mario_pony: take that back :[
/me hugs TheRainbowDash

D'awww....th...thanks...
i mean fluttershy just had those snappinng moments
d3rb: No.
and thats it
I just bought The Indie Humble Bundle V. The first one i bought
blasphemer!
all because of one line
/me snuggles Ninjazz.
/me pokes TheRainbowDash continiously.. "Was..... was... was... THAT MARIO?!"
it needs to be 20% cooler
apparent im sopposed to promote this: Minecraftgame.net
Airpuff: I guess so.
/me dies
/me revives Airpuff in a pagan ritual
mario_pony: the line is fine....the way the fanbase ran with it is WAYY over the top
Honestly, the reason why I love Rarity so much is because of her redeeming moments. Not just her singer, voice acting, her style, her looks... So on and so on. But the way she can put herself infront of everypony and still be their friend.
What happened to all the wub?
/me wakes up before dieing again, having seen mario
dead
i mean im not saying i hate her
GilDash: Are you trying to make me feel better?
just she could be more well devoloped
same as the cmc running gag
Ninjazz what do you mean with put infront of everyppony?
Ninjazz: Yeah. Rarity reminds me of me when I'm generous. I think I identify with her the most, really. I mean, I fucking drempt I *was* her and I acted accordingly. So... yeah. :D
Airpuff: lol why you die?
Ninjazz: Whats goin on? o.o Somethin wrong?
I'm interrested in hearding the Limb Soundtrack XD
i mean sure daw factor, but after equestrian confidental
GilDash: Woah, were dreamt as if you were her?....freaky.:D
Limbo*
what did evryone think of the b movie last night
Invi: How she can be so snooty when she that's actually just how she does things.
GilDash: :O
mario_pony: YOU ARE MY CHILDHOOD YOU REDHATTED PLUMBER! :D
GilDash: Oh did you?...
Ninjazz: Maybe I just keep saying Dashie's my favourite out of... loyalty? :$
I drempt I was and ws with Dashie....best dream ever.....
For sure.
pony_8304: but that was a decent ep
oh lol
GilDash: Bah.
GilDash: 6_9 must've been nice ;)
ik but i hope the cmc thing doesn't get old
It was a fantastic dream. I was at the spa with Twilight and Fluttershy. :)
who here is a magnifcent bastard
GilDash: ...I was in bed with Dashie.:D
apparent im sopposed to promote this: Minecraftgame.net :P
GilDash: ..... oh.. my...
/me shivers
same pony_8304, also your name is irritating to tab...so manyt people with a name that starts with just pony lol
My dreams are just awesome, aren't they?
TheRainbowDash: My lord, how come I did not see that coming? =_=
TheRainbowDash i thought you said you'd be creeped out by that
Airpuff: Nothing like *that* happened. We just had "the usual" and talked. :)
[wklmeb]JRP2234: i am actually watching your whole vid
GilDash: STILL!

alexxm: Not at all. I squeed when I saw her with me.
There's a reason I stopped posting in it
GilDash: Thats a totally awesome dream :P

Airpuff: I know. I want another. It was *such* a good dream. :)
02Same.
[wklmeb]JRP2234: are you australian?
I never get dreams.
The only reason I've been posting recently is because I have an army of pictures that make people go WTF
Inb4 GilDash tells me why
pony_8304 then use a non clever name. it can only be better that pony_67445r36
GilDash: Wish i dreamed like that.. i dream like.. once a year though -.-
doesnt need to be clever pony_8304, just anything
what makes you say that mario_pony ?
14uhm
Ninjazz: Then you'll never experience the true....awesomeness of them.:D
14hasn't Game.co.uk failed?
ok
Airpuff: So do I. :'(
14why is the website still around?
[wklmeb]JRP2234: well your voice

Alchemist I would like to do something metal releated, expecially in the parts of Computer and electronics (Stuff like the new Jelly Battery) but I would be fine with anything research, I just don't want something too repetitive
tanzania'
Ninjazz: .. So you buried them!? :$
Luna!
Chrysalis: 1. I'd need an adult for that 2. Don't have enough money 3. Not sure whether the hotel would approve of me camping out in someone's room for free
Airpuff: Eyup. :S

Phase4: ha, i'm always torn beween twi and aj
Airpuff: ... I don't even know. :D
08,01Luna as first prize, Twilight as second
Nyria: Princess Platinum, because she's the UKofE mascot, Octavia, because everyone loves Octavia and she represents the absolute class of those living in the UK, and Pinkie Pie because she represents our more chaotic side.
/me hugs QT_Marks

Bronysith OBJECTION! This evidence clearly proofes, that Lil' Miss Rarity > Lunaughty
08,01dishwasher_EXTREME: are you telling me you don't even like Lyra x Bon Bon?
Ninjazz: What? MY mind's messed up, okay? :D
/me looks over at Ninjazz .. "What?"
Lil_B: but lunaughty is an alicorn. she wraps her wings around me and uses magic
Lyra x Bon-Bon is on par with Octavia x Vinyl
So intense.

Airpuff: Doesn't matter. Maths is Kung Fu anyway.
Somepony stream something!
Ninjazz: This was back before it was a bannable offence mind.
double rainboom
08,01equations are not allowed to take the form ∫(otakon) dx, where x =/= otakon
GilDash: You were here back then? :S
GilDash: .. i guess.. since kung fu is everything right?
Ninjazz: Possibly... :)
Airpuff: Exactly. :)
08,01basically, that's maths for "don't ship otakon with anyone except himself"
08,01i actually wrote a song about shipping otakon
Airpuff x Airpuff... ?
GilDash: I think you can~ Afterall many people do it in their spare time~
GilDash: You can be shipped with your own hooves.
08,01Bronysith: yup
08,01in the style of a G&S aria
Nyria, Ninjazz: ... Oh my. ::D
imagine otakon is x and the chance that he will get shipped is y when we mutiplied x by y divided by triple shipped chance like ninjazz or gildash we have....
GilDash: :3
08,01Simon: easy
08,01Simon: 2 secs

for those who wonder why there are more then 8 plantes http://www.howtogeek.com/115302/is-pluto-a-planet-or-not-video/
11,01If you're talking about Kuiper Belt objects, then they probably won't be named.
11,01Or classified as a planet.
08,01Vordox: yup
08,01DerpSurge: someone liked me enough to put them on me
:D
Pluto!

11,01I grew up with Pluto as a planet.
I want aliens to exist so badly
Isn't that still a planet though?
but pluto isnt a planet anymore its just a rock
alexxm: Oh, that's cool.
the video started to stutter for me :/
08,01i think Sedna is a KPO
08,01might be wrong
Same Alchemist
08,01(Kuiper Belt Object)
the problem is, the differenc between an Plante and a big asteroid isn't 100% defined
08,01dat beethoven
Hey guys can someone PM me I'm having an issue with ponies going across the screen.
WTF
suddenly humans
FIRE IT BURNS!
Pluto will always be a planet to me

cachi01: who knows :D
cachi01: I'll remain sceptical until they do :)
Just looked up a picture of a silkmoth, those are cool, Never seen one before - nor a moth of that size - biggest one I've ever seen are the occasional Hummingbird Moths that Houston has
There are rumor about that every year!
HL2: Ep2: Part 2

But all in the Orange Box 2.
Dota 2, L4D3, HL3?

there will be no globaal offensive for consoles???
Biglaw: Doing good, about to start a new chapter on my story, and you?
Nittany_Discord: The big unethical ones... which is pretty much the big ones, yeah. :D
Lil_B: We just had Portal 2!

Im more buzzed about the X-com remake.
They should just stick HL3 on Steam without any announcement or feature box
TheRainbowDash I'm good, I've been making a lot of art recently.
Ninjazz so? :3

Biglaw: Oh, that's good to hear.:)

Cypresswolf we wants even had them in germany, when we had a heat record in the summer a few years ago

I dunno, but Firaxis is the developer
wtf

LOL!XD
11,01Chrysalis: Thanks?
Nittany_Discord: Who cares. It's going to be an FPS anyway. :S
for dat last kick
^ :(
11,01K.
GilDash: Nonono, they're making a legit X-COM game now!
11,01If it's a major publisher forcing it to be an FPS, then you have a bad reason behind the choice.
my chat derped
someone pinged me?
DerpSurge: I'll believe it when I see it...
11,01It's like the Syndicate remake. EA published that.
Yeah... I think they are making an FPS and a remake.
i still like how MW3 was outsold by blackops
History of the World: Part 1?
Dishonored might be good
g
gf
gfd
gf
they are blaming market saturation
gfg
d
DerpSurge there are multible X-Com remakes, one of them is an FPS, the other one will be something else
when they did it all themselves
Hat: ITS GOING TO BE EEEEEEEEPIC
08,01Cypresswolf: that's what they're called: the hummingbird hawk moth
Hopefully it is like the trailer
yeah i hope it doesnt end like dead island
Nittany_Discord: nono, they are making a legit remake, not the fps one, and I think they have Sid Meier as a consultant. thats a good sign IMO.
/me 11,01spheres
Chrysalis the MW Frenchise broke sales records 3 times in a row :/
08,01or Macroglosum stellatarum, iirc
11,01Alchemist: Sounds fun.
Chrysalis: Market saturation?! Obviously the solution is to saturate it further then! =_(\
moths... one time in my high school a friend of mine found an atlas moth
11,01MW3 sold a lot of copies in a day.
Nittany_Discord I think 3 mill
11,01But its sales have tailed off faster than BO's.
I don't think MW3 got to the top of Top Sellers on Steam's page
MW3 is an interesting case. Its NOTHING new and still people loved it.
Nittany_Discord they finally actually paid of mw2 as well
BO was a better game anyway.
I still have my Dad's camera...with a 300x zoom lense :) I need to plan a trip to Memorial part for a photo trip before he asks for it back
minecraft broke the world reord of most downloads in xbox arcade.. the last one to do this was trials evlution and it achieved it in a week, minecraft broke the record in a day

Nittany_Discord: BO? :S
11,01Black Ops.
Hey Nitt

cachi01: I've heard that the xbox version is a bit dumbed down. Is it true that the xbox version doesnt have pistons?
11,01Hey DCD.

08,01does anyone know who John Harrison was?
Hello NewDCD.

cachi01 seems like everything has user generated levels these days
Hello again, CCCP.
hi Michael Lil_B cachi01 Ninjazz
alexxm: yeah lol
hey CCCP hows your day been
11,01I still play games. I just lost the joy of waiting for new titles. Publishers have ruined them enough in development that I don't get excited about them anymore.
alexxm: its been pretty boring
I still love Nintendo's conference
08,01hey CCCP!
TheRainbowDash: ohai, thanks
it always brings some entertainment
nintendo's conference are always great
I'm waiting for the VGA E3-Coverage and the Lordkat one... Will E3 be streamed onn BS?
I still remember that one where they revealed the 3DS
They had BITCHES
11,01I was hoping the latest Twisted Metal would avoid publisher bullshit, but Sony forced an Online Pass on the dev (it was forced).
what games are they working on now cachi01
cachi01 YES (If I'm a Fanbopy of anything, it's Nintendo)
alexxm: i think ssm for 3DS and new super mario bros 2
alexxm: and i dont know if they already finished luigis mansion 2
history of humanity :D
alexxm they wanna talk about Pikmin 3
11,01Jafee doesn't like online passes and didn't want to use them, but Sony forced him. So, lost sale.
also pikmin 3!
also Nintendo is probably going to talk alot about Wii U
alexxm: ssb*
there needs to be moar kirby games
kirby is the best thing ever made
CCCP: Yeah!
Nittany_Discord: As I don't follow much video gaming these days, what are online passes? :S
11,01So many major titles are lost sales for me, I don't want to get excited for them.
MegaMoonShine: :D
i want ace attorney 5!
CCCP calm down, we had Kirby Return to dreamland
GilDash: Oh boi...
09,01Nittany, come to fighting games
need moar metroid games
09,01we don't deal with that bullshit
and even there we also had some good DS Kirby games
CrimsonPhoenix: but we need! moar!!! :D
moar zelda games!
Sith, RP?
how many days intill um the person reading MLD ?
09,01unless it's lolCrapcom
NewDCD: Get Extend :P
CCCP you played Mass Attack?
Ninjazz: What? :S
Michael the are rumors about a Metroid game by EPIC-Games
11,01GilDash: It's a code that grants you access to the MP part of games. They only give it out in new copies. Anyone that buys used has to pay for the code.
pale blue dot.mov?
GilDash: There you go.
CrimsonPhoenix: actually i have not, is it good?
09,01Vordox, I'm on it...Limited Edition is Used - Like New for $25 in Amazon
It's great
Nittany_Discord theres nothing wrong with that though
Lil_B: rly? great :)
09,01I'm saving up for it and streaming gear
Lil_B: wow by metroid with gore lol
not classic Kirby action but still
11,01Chrysalis: It's a rip-off cast as twisted facts.
second hand is just a loss for anyone involved in making games
Nittany_Discord whats the point of these codes
Nittany_Discord: I hate that kind of shit. It's just like day 1 DLC as well. :S
11,01That the used game market is evil.
Michael cachi01 really only rumors...
am i the only one that REALLY liked kirby's Epic Yarn????
it IS evil
NewDCD: AWESOME! :D YOu live in US though and is it PS3?
:(
08,01well, i hope you all enjoyed that
the people who worked or funded the game get nothing
09,01don't live in US, getting a PS3 soon, as well as an arcade stick
WiiU will probably support 2 Tablet controllers
while other people profit on their hardword
11,01And we should feel bad for buying used.
08,01how's the qualityu?
hardwork
i enjoyed
08,01is it desync'd or anything?
Anypony want to ERP?
So they force us to feel bad.
11,01Anyway, online passes are a way for publishers and developers to make money off of used games.
11,01Which I think is wrong.
IT IS WRONG
and whats wrong with the people who made a game to make money off of it
I think it's unfair and unjustified.
I ment in a private chat
Nittany_Discord: Of course it is. Because there's *no damned regulation* in the games industry.
then where would the money come from
wut
02Well
11,01Chrysalis: They already did in the initial sale.
dat console
TARDIS!
02Since the LPW became a Meme train
11,01And game publishers are the only people to complain about used sales.
World Economy is crashing cause of Piracy :p
so they should just be ok with second hand stores making large profits off of their work
dat tardis
without getting anything backl
If anypony wants to, join #orgy
11,01And punish people for buying used.
02I guess we're able to make it a doubles thread
02*shot*
09,01(here)
omg
lol dat room
wtf?
>_>
dat room O_o
is that

Today appeared a rainbow colored cloud in Brazil
What the....
no thx molly :s
Derpyty: indeed. xD
Nittany_Discord: I know. I didn't get punished for buying my 8 year old car, why the fuck do games companies get away with it. (I know, no regulation... :D)
/me doesn't want to remember that
Princess_Molestia: Oh god why? :(
dat chrome
its not the game industry that is bitching about used markets
whee with having to buy food from somewhere just so i can take their wifi

dafuq
?
i never use inline anyway so i'm not rellay affected
hej
lol
h
what
that sound derp
now the sound is stuttering big time
to be quite honest, the gaming industry is suffering with the movie/music industry
:p
... scary sound is scary o.o
11,01Also, gamers that buy into the publishers argument and defend online passes. It's defending being ripped off.
he is staring at meeeeeeeeeeeee
Ummm the sound is horrible
having fun with Win8
its not being ripped off
Now it's good
08,01should be fixed now
its paying for what you use
dat rainbow center
the big name publishers are saying the same things as RIAA/MPAA
if you dont want to pay, dont play
14I still can't fix the audio issue I'm having on Win7 :(
good
Good evening everypony~
08,01btw, in case anyone is in any doubt: this is satire.

08,01Airpuff: how about now?
Hey Starflash~

They just acknowledge that gamers are idiots, and that approach totally works.
:s
Viri
/me glomps Nyria
Yay.

11,01Chrysalis: Why should I have to pay for something that's part of the original game?
;Z
/me hugs Starflash back~ ^^
14I downloaded several
14all same problem
hey Starflash hows your day been
Summary: Korean FTC authorities are investigating Blizzard for refusal to refund legal purchases of Diablo 3, and have seized computers, documents, etc to try to determine if Blizzard is breaking the law by doing so.
11,01Taking a good game apart for greed purposes is wrong.
yeah, little choppy for me as well. and video audio getting off
aqww
what is the problem.
Nittany_Discord because your not paying for the game, your paying for the disk
;3
alexxm pretty good, yours?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5106/
14well
14the audio is normal
14but
11,01Chrysalis: And that's abused.
Chrysalis: Yet you don't actually own the disc either. :S
14when I watch a video on youtube, it's slightly distorted
14very slightly
oh
CCCP: Oh well Spiderman.
14it's still annoying
go
I dont mind special offers for say preordering from Gamestop or what not, ONLY, AND ONLY if it doest affect the story or adds serious plot elements to the game
i'm good Starflash going to show my dad mst3k today
GilDash you do, just not whats on it, only be allowed to use it
rhr
Did you
TheRainbowDash: :3
you get a liscence for it
02:34 :|
God damn it YT.
turn off flash's hardware acceleration?
11,01If I only buy the disc, I'll just buy a blank floppy and copy the game.
14o.o
alexxm good idea xD
see: ME3
14do I have to turn that off'
i heard windows 8 was made by microsoft
11,01Better game for the cost of a disc.
14*?
is this true?
I hate mock interviews like that. I get that its a troll humour, but I dont like it.
Nittany_Discord: i see the problem, but they might use it for maintaining the servers, and paying for them?
11,01As in, I get everything I bought with it.
..NOPE
Made by apple
::
;p
oh
Nit, my theory is, I bought the game with my money, it is mine to do with as I wish to do with it
that explains a lot
still
lol
viri
08,01Alchemist: i found it hilarious
11,01Airpuff: They maintained servers fine before online passes.
it's not made by linux
try rlgihtcligfkjgnf

Chrysalis: Well, yes, you only own the plastic and foil. But without actually having *any* control over the software on it, you might as well say that you own nothing except an expensive frisbee.
and make sure the hardware thing is not checked
GilDash: I disagree
Nittany_Discord: Exactly. And people can always set their own servers up anyway.
Nittany_Discord: .. ah.. i see.. im pretty against it myself.. but yeah..
RyunosukeKnT: Go and read the EULA and come back to me.
I'm having the same problems with .swfs on here on Mint
This is so awkward :D
14it doesn't change
14:(
08,01goddamn buffer shuffle...
What is this show
an anology is towards the automobile, you wouldnt steal a car, but if I buy a car, I can modify said car as I see fit and for my needs
Lollwut!? :D
08,01Hat: it's a youtube vid
do these people know this is a joke
dat cereal wall
try closing your browser?
:p
Wall of cereal!
hmm?
11,01RyunosukeKnT: You don't own the software. It's in the license agreement.
What browser are you using?
no
Is it possible to request
08,01called "The Gays: An Investigative Report"
Ryunosuke not to any extent, you have to abide by road laws
I can change the engine, I can change the wheels, I can change the upholstery
?mmh
Wait what is it about?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5096/
11,01You own a right to use it, but EULAs usually give the end company more rights than you do.
the stream sound derped..
localtime
if you want to be raged just watch ANY video about the westboro baptist church.
i prefer austin 3:16
08,01Airpuff: it's a satire
RyunosukeKnT: And you are legally allowed to do that. You can't with software. It's more analogous to *renting* a car when you "buy" a game.
poor phase :(
and if you dont like it, dont accept the EULA and return it for a full refund
11,01Like the right to terminate the license and force you to destroy your game copies.
14firefox
I JUSt return to "God hates gays, What did you do to make him hate gays"
14nope, not going to change it xDD
:D
Chrysalis: if I want to drive it on public highways yes, but I can in thieron to do anything AS LONG as I dont drive it
14IE and Chrome gives me the same problem anyway
well then obviously it is FF's fault
:p
11,01They can call you and tell you to turn your game over, and you can't do squat.
/me flee
14xD
have you tried reinstalling flash?
and you CHOOSE to accept that
*thieron = theory
if you want to you can just deny the EULA and return it
I keep lagging, brb
240 we meet again
however the game industry does not give me that choice :)
dafuq are we watching?
wait wut is this?
240p we meet again
Chrysalis: No you can't! You have to open the copy to get to view the EULA, and from that point you're fucked.
damn it Michael!
Nittany_Discord: dafuq is this?
lag is lagggg
lulz

08,01this is "The Gays: An Investigative Report"

Hello kirzstryfe ! place a dispenser there.
11,01Or digital downloads.
ohai kirzstryfe
Dem questions
08,01Alchemist: gays love and tolerate too
11,01So if you buy the game and disagree with the EULA, you're out whatever that game cost.
and you cannot enforce a "you have to delete" theory
Alchemist they're probably in on it
Its called satire folks
that is invasion of privacy, which most western countries kinda disdain on
take a bath?
hi everypony

hi necroshadow123

ScootaChicken 17 minutes until bed time young man.
this is one reason I play MMOs
11,01What needs to happen is that gamers need to stop buying the bullshit and stop compromising. Buying games with bad business practices in them hurts everyone but the publisher (dev) because those practices will continue and even worsen.
DashWithRainbows: Go away :P
08,01shoul be better now

Nitt: Quality < Quantiy. :P
14I tried already
14:(
How is it going everypony?
but, why do ppl like to buy bullshit games?
11,01If not, the industry will crash because legal games will become so unattractive that whatever price that's put on them won't be worth it.
better :D thanks
i'm good Obsidian how about you
we have less than half of us in here?

@SuperBrony64: Isn't that good?
No predators on land what a world
and then dinosaur
Lil_B: my father is a microbiologist, and once in primary school my class took a field trip to the lab, and we made bacteria colonies. My dad had the petri dishes ready with the agar, all we had to do is touch it with our fingers and in half hour a huge ass colony formed, after that he preached about the significance of washing hands regurarly :D
05trying to figure out how colors would be distracting, cant find any reason.
Once in a whale, they'll need some kelp
11,02BallCrusher2000: Ofc :3
w-w-w-w-wall text
04That was a private pastebin, yes?

time zones hate me
11,01With SuperBrony64's error bar, we could have this meeting done an hour ago.
Alchemist we will make all new colonys... they moved the refrigirator last friday, and somebody turned off the electricity. Now all bakteria died there... 1000$ worth of damage and a lot of lost time
Yeaaaah... we're monkeys
0,5At least it better NOT be >_>
Bye TheRainbowDash :)
11,02>>
13again, hopesfully i don't get dragged away .-.

BallCrusher2000: Apes.
BallCrusher2000: Apes actually
We're BETTER monkeys :D
I wish i was a pony instead :(
Gross... she's all naked and shit.
Where was Gondor when suddenly Meanwhile
0,5I bet you we won't be
StupidSexyCJ: Ninja'd. :p
04:D
save a few minutes: "1. modifying the webchat client to show kick/ban messages" << easy
Where indeed.
Humans didnt evolve from monkey, but we have the same ancestors... LERAN PEOPLE! EVERYONE ELSE GETS IT WRONG!
Allo everypony.
Meanwhile: hi
pony is next step of evolving
0,5:3
O_O?
Hey Meanwhile!
04LESS THAN ONE MINUTE
Meanwhile: Holla! :)
04FINAL WARNING
/me hugs Bronysith back "Hai :3"
13not lightIRC, but switching to iris would work
greetings Meanwhile
Hello Meanwhile
hai Meanwhile
13but we need to consult ircops about that
Hi Meanwhile
CCCP: we can hope Equestria is really an alien world :D
0,5*SMB music gets faster*
GilDash: Next time GilDash, NEEEXT TIIEEMM!
kabaka should be online
what in the world???
Lil_B: same ancestors?
Lil_B: O.O that sucks. My uni has a power outage every year for maintenance reasosn but it is scheduled to avoid losses.
implying we are digimons
lightirc has an option iirc
DerpSurge: that would be soo amazing
/me puts on SRS faic. lets do this!
PSYCHOTRIP!!!
extremly interesting
im not a monkey
04STOP
im a pokemon!
04Alright
I'm going to catch you! =D
wat lvl?
cachi01: what kind?
What a story Mark.
phsycic type!
/me throws a pokeball to cachi01
04Welcome everyone to the meeting, I hope you all have your game face on because we begin now
Alchemist somebory pressed a button, with big letters "DO NOT PRESS!" and the NOT is the Button!
BallCrusher2000: run run as fast as you can! u cant catch me in the pokemon man!
fluttershy?!
im*
How old is this video? -_^
/me 11,01presses pointless button.
/me eats pokeball
If you were turned into a pony right now what would your cutie mark be
in other words, Trees are best ponies
11,01*shrug*
omg
cachi01: the hell? I'm a car, of course I can catch you!
Fluttershy is graceful
04I'm going to start the meeting off, I hope you are ready. My opening and topic should only take about 10 minutes total, so I'll immediately begin: Communication, it's the majority topic that everyone has been discussing for this meeting and I feel the same
my cutie mark is a bamboo tablet pen
My cutie would be for procrastination, but it isn't here yet.
well im phsycic i just can fly and then u will ot be able to catch me!
thats why we kill so many plats
Fluttershy is not trivial!
plants*
lol Meanwhile you have a lazy cutiemark?
Oh god the video doing weird things
Indeed.
It'll appear when it can be bothered.
LAG
The music is going off pitch making the plants seem weird
dat souns
Meanwhile: haha
Getting some bad lag here
tell the DJ to stopp screing with the Tape
Oh lord
sounds*
my cutie maaark would be something videogame music and fun related
Educational remix.
04However, I want to discuss the lack of communication that had been lingering between Team Leaders in the TL group; before last week it was hardly used because admins or departments would keep important bits of news or ideas concealed to their own departments or to SRS where it would get washed away amongst lighthearted chatter
11,02Moo :>
SCIENCE
lol
E-e-e-e-e-e-evolu-lu-lu-lution
Hai SuperBrony64
Lil_B: LAWL! I thought of a DJ playing and DCing a Cassette Tape XD
cachi01 mine would ba a N64 Controller
SuperBrony64: are you a cow?
wat have science done!?!!?!
When everyone wakes up, I get sleepy.
Planty buisness.
11,02Lil_B: Hehe ^-^
valoreins: more science?
SuperBrony64 has best moo
more lag
we dddddddeeal about ooooooour busines
11,02My cutie mark is a Nintendo 64 controller :)
h-hhh-hello mr p-ppp-pppott-tt-tter
good for you SB :D
04So with that in mind we decided to reassess the situation there and we worked to make sure that any info or ideas we have is always communicated in the TL group so that way we all know what's going on and there's less chance of important things getting washed away
valoreins: oh and instant soups with ramen. I love those too :)
Mine is one big diamond.
SuperBrony64... then I choose the N64-Sign
SuperBrony64 has best cutie mark
What going on with the video? O_o
/me snuggles Ninjazz.
Ninjazz: We can be sleepy together. ;)
o_O
:s
My Cutiemark? Blank Flank
Sure. I'm getting tired.
/me hugs Lil_B "We can both share the controller cutie mark :P"
How do you determine cutie mark
/me points at Vordox "BLANK FLANK"
04But Team Leaders, please use the room more often. Anything that comes up for a department you should mention in the TL group so we can all see what's going on. Please.
/me bucks Lil_B
/me cuddles with Ninjazz.
The video is headed for the event horizon and the time space continuum is starting to fall apart.
Hat: just something you really like
what are watching?
:3
/me 11,01is watching Mish
SuperBrony64 thanks X
Hat: and u r good at
my cutie mark would be fire
My cutie mark would be FiM and would be awkward to explain to other ponies
necroshadow123: pyromaniac?
^ Hat Wins
And mine flank will be blank =(
04To also help with this communication, the admin team has decided on weekly "mini-meetings" meaning that once a week, preferrably Wednesday or something, the admin team talks to the TLs in the TL group and we recap and lightly discuss info that has come our way
Alchemist: i make fires very quickly and yes im a pyro
story of the blanks
oh, my stream is totally desynced now
Laag
Lil_B: mine too =(
BLOOD
Ewwww bloooood
04We believe this will help facilitate better communication and less forgetting of ideas and info
necroshadow: buring stuff is fun unless the stuff is alive :D
Meh, blood's fine. :)
Science....
YES
animation!
04And yes, we are also listening to any ideas or suggestions the TLs or staff may have
04We, as in Admins
oooh golgi apparatus
Blood is good for you
Alchemist: ive burnt a mouse that was alive
How old is this?
and filaments
and rough endoplasmatic reticulum
necroshadow123: like... computer mouse?
I probably shooldn't listen to this, because of how much the understanding of DNA has changed today
04For the team leaders, the admin team asks that you also conduct a mini session (meeting) with your own dept. once a week and then report back info for the weekly TL meeting
Alchemist: And ribosomes. ;)
BallCrusher2000: no live mousie mice
/me is having trouble keeping his eyes open
dem atoms
04Now
gilDash: there were too much stuff on screen so I just gave up on naming more of them :D
04Some of you may have heard: Quote of the Day
/me throws bucket of cold water to Ninjazz
necroshadow123: Oh... suck to be mouse...
/me tapes Ninjazz's eyes open
O__O
/me slaps Ninjazz
O____O
WAKE UP
O______O
/me removes the tapes, and lies Ninjazz in a bed
:3
BallCrusher2000: they shouldent be eating my popcorn
I NOW THE MUSIC! BACKS AIR!
/me holds her hoof over Ninjazz's eyes and nuzzles him.
Bachs Air*
/me throws a bucket of cold water to Airpuff and Ninjazz
04Sumi and I had been talking about a "Quote of the Day" function where people could draw various postings from the chat in BronyState and then either put them up in their own section or have them spotlighted on our home page or something. It's just an idea for now but it seems many have taken a liking to it
lol ive played this song on a violin
13Oi.
13Cut the RP.
13Now.
hiya Shizuka
Hello Shizuka.
hai Shizuka
goodbye RP!
Booth good and bad thing.
Hello Shizuka
Hey! For once Im not the cause of RP!
hi Shizuka!
necroshadow123: oh... yeah, that's just unforgivable. I think you should've smash it before you've burnt it.
04It's certainly something for the tech team that needs to be addressed on how to implement it. Shizuka believes it can be done, it's just a matter of how we do it
>;3
04Alruight, BronyCon
One, I stopped being beaeted to hell and the other I get to sleep alone. :3
hiya Shizuka
04*Alright
Wow, this animation IS old...
It's so old your mum saw it in school.
AWESOME powers
04As you may know, we were contacted by one of the con organizers to be at BronyCon
Ninjazz: Don't count on it. :D
Ninjazz: .. not bad. xD
08,01er, sound desynced?
04After negotiations, we were able to get tickets and a room for BronyState
BallCrusher2000: i picked it up (still on fire) and threw it on cement as hard as i could
Meanwhile: I've seen it in my school. In RUSSIA, DAMN IT!
Meanwhile: a bit newer than that. unless its from the 60's
BallCrusher2000: That is immensely old.
GilDash: I never count on anything these days. =__=
Airpuff: Both good... and bad.
oh MY~
my oh
Whatever happened to people just going "Aww shit son" When people make your mum jokes?
:=
O_O
:O
Ninjazz: Bad? :O Who would've thought
necroshadow123: Good. Then its live wasn't so bad at all.
08,01is that about where it was?
I heard "Shit"
sSlightly more forward
Meanwhile: if that was a joke it failed miserably :D
We weree at "Blood"
04I sent him an email and we did get a response back on hotel room info. We have the room from 6/29 - 7/1
Alchemist: Apparently so.
Airpuff: Didn't you see me getting mistreated? :<
:) sciences
04No news on hotel room number yet
BallCrusher2000: it was a bit living so i crushed its head wit my foot
Ninjazz: No one cares.
Ninjazz: Nay, did not? o.o
Meanwhile: I wasn't talking to you.
Ninjazz Are u ok?
Meanwhile: well i do, so you're wrong :)
Ninjazz: I know. Just throwin' it out there.
Mish: Now i am.
Airpuff: You don't count as a person.
necroshadow123: Shhh! Nobody should hear it. Or we will be taken to police
:) good
Meanwhile: ahahaha okei
we are bronies
asdf movie 6
bronies are 20% cooler than people
^
Meanwhile: Never change, do you? :|
^^
04As far as we know Nittany, Slurry, Scoot, fluttercry, and SuperBrony64 are going with Super leading the team, however, there is a possibility I may go but it's not looking that way. I can't afford the money right now, so I'll have Super go in my stead to watch after the team.
Ninjazz: Eenope.
Bronysith: indeed.
So true Bronysith :)
Bronysith: eeyup
04We won't have a booth or a presentation of any sort, but we will be in the Con booklet
PIERCE THE HEAVENS with you brohoof
Meanwhile: Nice to see you're your usually happy self. :D
04Just enjoy yourselves, but most importantly BE SAFE
"bleed to death with the smallest scrach", discription of a horrid disease that causes humans to YES bleed to death at the smallest cut
WHO DA HAY do you think we are
Poeple (like my brother) are not ready to become true men.
04And that's all I have for me, for now.
GilDash: your irony amuses me. xD
get to know other ponies, maybe discover some possible partners
BallCrusher2000: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl44-vXeE60
one additional about Bronycon
05(and take images, lots of images)
Hey I'm very happy, I'm watching a vid of some guy falling down stairs right now.
It's hilarious.
i got my brony shirt today. i am a happy pony!
we wont be streaming it
Mish: the brother of princess anastasia had that disiease
I feaking love this song
04Oh, and uh, one other thing. Because I don't see it here...
04Streaming
but if the attendees want to do some sort of recording or something
13streaming is on the list ghosties
1,11What'd I miss?
then talk to the admins about it
Bronysith: YAY! I gotta get me some pony T-shirts.
DAmn it! My stream is desynched =(
@Silver ghosties intro
Bronysith: u lucky :)
/me brohoofs Bronysith
04Then I passed it over because I really don't see it
Epic
04But
don't worry there will be logs
Meanwhile: Oh you. :D
Bronysith whats on the shirt?
THE POWER OF BROFOOFS! /)
04Anyways, we're going to be redoing the streaming format for non-official streams
04Here are the following new rules for the stream
*Brohoofs
Ponies47: EPIC BROHOOOOOF (\
theres me in my shirt
Meanwhile: seen on the botom of the ocean? The ending there has the most "hillarious" way of saying hillarious.. xD
then who was brony?
08,01also, he posted a video link.
In "birthmarked", this desiase was ravaging in most of the population(its gentic; they needed more outsider breeding) well most of the wallled-in enclave
well the one i poseted
I do not want to click that link given the kick description... >_>
08,01Bronysith: not you
043 hours max, no double stacking (as in, no double backing on your stream), you may only stream twice 24 hours, and you have five minutes to wrap your stream up if there is someone else in queue
08,01Ponies47: he was describing how he set fire to, then crushed with his foot, a live mouse
:) I got my frist bronyshirt awhile ago
we are identical to fluttershy?
and then people said I can't wear it :(
08,01what an utterly horrible human being
i just met a brony on omegle
who is this pedophile?
So i switched to the pinkie pie "IS WATCHING YOU" shirt
I'd like to be a tree...
yay
08,01cachi01: necroshadow123
CCCP: I goes on Omegle all the time and ask poeple if they watch ponies :P
O_O
at the gala....at the gala.....
dats horriblle
:]
:[
Glad i missed that
so... we are Ponys?
Ponies47: yay /)
Ponies R infectious
CCCP: (\
Alchemist: trololol
Mish: indeed -.-
Show the Metropolis theme........
I'll go eat something.
OH DAT INTENSE FACE
Dats just sick what necroshadow123 did :O
04Admin team are working on creating a bot/script to get a stream clock going for streaming: at an hour remaining you will be notified, at 30 minutes remaining you will be notified, and then at 5 minutes prior you will be asked to clean up. You will have five minutes passed the three hour mark to finish up your stream if there is someone else in line.
Bronysith is it ok if i add you as a friend on DA?
SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
04If there is no one else in the queue, you may continue streaming for as long as you want
Lil_B: sure! :)
04But as soon as someone else calls for queue, you will have fifteen minutes to clean up
i wonder if this movie has fanservice
04There will be infractions for breaking the streaming
someone will have to speak sooner or later
time for the lecture on the enviorment
04Infractions occur when you don't leave the stream even after you've been given your five or fifteen minute grace period
But at least it isnt compltetly blamming...MAN?!?!
04(There are still be discussed, but these are the infractions planned for now)
this guy really doens't like safty mesures
Dat lightning
cachi01: blah
IT'S ALIVE!
It turned inside out and exploded. :O
Lil_B: to be honest most professors tend to dismiss saftey protocols, and some times I agree with that.
04First infraction is a week ban from streaming, second infraction is no streaming until you've explained yourself adaquately and thoroughly to the rest of the team on why you decided to go past your grace period again. And, finally, permabanned from streaming
Alchemist Me too, Some things are a little bit too strikt and unneccesary
I looked away for like ten minutes and now there's a big onion covered in bike clips on the screen.
Do I want to know why?
04Okay, NOW, that's all I have
Meanwhile: cool isnt it? :D
Meanwhile: Probably not. :D
for example: here you cant have gas canisters in the lab unless there is some apparatus on them.
Alright then.
11,01First infraction violation seems harsh.
Meanwhile: What?...
:D
Meanwhile: buddy of him made prehistoric earth-jizz
bye
13would rather we use a skype group for streaming to keep better tabs on who is up and in queue
^ nitt
13as is the requests get lost in SRS
1,11I think first and second infractions should be switched.
it's in that bottle
CCCP bye :(
bye CCCP!
"Prehistoric earth-jizz"
MAN. YES MAN. HUMAN IN SHAPE BUT SATANIC IN SPRIT. THEY STEP ON YOR HOMES, RAPE DOGGIES, AND KICK BABIES. IF YOU EVER SEE ONE OF THESE CEATURES, CONTACT YOU SHOTTY MOVIE MAKING STUDIO IMMETALY AND MAKE BAD, RETARED ENVIORMENTAL FILMS noW.
Well that explains it.
^
waog
bye CCCP
Cya CCCP.
latter CCCP
13the infractions just make it sound like you don't trust us
Shizuka: We do have a solution for that, which will be mentioned later in the meeting
Mish dem Caps
Dat wall of caps.
Hello Om.
/me hugs CCCP
Mish: bye
Hello everyone!
Bye CCCP
I dislike aps
hiya Cobellanez
I think the larger issue with streaming etiquitte is that people do not ask for time to stream, and the current rules aren't being enforced
Hello Cobellanez.
0,5They do
By bye CCCP :(
Bye Brony?
Hi Cobellanez
but the profs hate carriyng canisters back and forth, so they just slap a gas bubbler on the canister to say they are testing if the canister leaks, and thats legal :)
oh bai CCCP
YES there could be
By mah CCCP
hai Cobellanez
13and last, 3 hours max or else bad things happen, but if no one else is up you can go forever
13these two conflict
hello bronies!
Ji Ninjazz
hi theSHHAS
hai theSHHAS
Hello theSHHAS.
ohai theSHHAS
04As I said, if there is someone else in queue then you have three hours max
Hello theSHHAS
Om: Hello. ;)
hi Om
0,5THree hours max if someone is on qu- he beat me to it
Om: Ji to you too, mate. :)
HEELRO T\theSHHAS
04If there isn't someone in queue then you can continue streaming past three hours
13we have five minutes to wrap up or we have fifteen
O_O
11,015 for someone in queue, 15 if not.
theSHHAS: would u like to be part of the brony fukireta parade?
0,5^I wondered that too
11,01From what I gather.
1,11You have a time limit so long as there's other people wanting to stream. But why force them to stop streaming when there's nobody to go up after thm.
Hunters OHSHET
i'm not seeing a need for these to be hard rules right now, people vacate the stream when someone else shows up
wee also have Spitters, Hunters, Boomers, Smokers, and Tanks
04Five minutes if there was already someone in queue, fifteen if there wasn't and you continued streaming past three hours
GilDash: To early for rarity faces -_-
:D
11,02No they don't, if no-one else is in the queue, you can keep streaming. No reason to keep the stream empty if someone wishes to stream. But everyone should be able to stream if they want to and three hours is more than enough time for that to happen.
13[12:37] [+Shizuka] the infractions just make it sound like you don't trust us
Hey hey hey Om :)
whats the brony fukireta parade?
hai Om
04That's because we really want to cut down on frequently long streaming with people going on for hours and hours
Yo, Om, I appreciate you telling me you're leaving but stay for 10 damn seconds so I can say good bye. :D
Om: Not for me it isn't. ;)
1,11That's why I said to switch the 1st and second infractions.
13as it is, we tend to let people go on because they're streaming good stuff
GilDash: Meh
04And we recognize that most people don't want to say anything to the person streaming
11,01They go on for hours when no-one else is streaming.
1,11If you can explain yourself the first time, it shows we trust you, but we're conserned about ettiquette.
11,01In queue.
11,02Infractions are the cold justice to breaking those rules. They are there to be fair for everyone, if you break them, you're not being fair to everyone else. As long as you follow those rules, you should be fine.
magics
Ninjazz: I told you I was going.
11,01I've never known anyone to hog the stream.
Om: Stick around a little so you can hear us say goodbye though... ;)
Om: You didn't wait for my farewell. :(
09,01personally, I think we've had a pretty big problem
Ooo Om ! Hai
Ninjazz dissaproves of your statement OM
09,01I mean
1,11What SuperBrony64 said.
09,01if someone else is streaming
yeah. you told us moments ago sir
:3
theSHHAS: search on youtube for fukireta dance
09,01and we've asked to follow on the queue, and they keep streaming...who of us has the heart to tell them "hey, it's my turn now"
Ninjazz: I'm sure it was a lovely and heartfelf goodbye.
11,01I'm not against infractions.
worse comes to worse, we have the embed switcher
GilDash: I didn't feel like it.
11,02That too
Bye OMNOMNOM
Om: Aw, what's wrong? :)
:)
Om: Alright, man. I'll back off for now.
I realized that I cant study if Im on here... I read several pages but I have no idea what it was :D
13and nearly everyong has access to it
11,01Can we set up the stream sharing again?
11,01I don't.
Take a look! It's in a book! reading rainbow!
Actually we have a different idea too, which we will mention in a bit
11,01I don't have access to embed switching.
... Hi... Om ....
09,01I don't think the infractions will actually be enforced because I don't think anybody will break the rules once we set up a good system, as you are all reliable people, but every law or rule needs to have a consequence, regardless
Furryeh Babieshs
FFFRRRRGHHH
Well right now I'm tired.
13everyone does now
no more SCIENCES?
science time is over? D:
00,10In all honistly the infractions irk me. You want to issue punishments on somthing people do with there spare time as a service.
Nittany_Discord, its on the site, wp-admin->settings->embed switcher
D:
Om: Bastard stop ignoring me! xDD
MOAR science
11,01I looked there and couldn't find it.
1,11DCD, we all have it in us to tell someone to step down. We do it all the time for bans and such.
11,01I'll see again.
huh
:[ MORE SCIENCES
Now onto literature, grammar and history :D
04It's to make sure everyone gets a fair chance, Sumica
What a story science guy.
HISTORY?
I'm tired too. Hell, exhausted even.
YAY
TARDIS!
WHO IS streaming right now?
09,01I've seen it a ton of times, and I have experienced it myself
I see your email
05i am sceptical on how the stream queues works. a steamer might well be unable to constantly watch is someone asks in SRS for a stream spot. so unless there's a proper way to build a queue, that is actually delivered to the streamer at hand. most of the times I dont even know there's a queue cause no one pings me in IRC which basically is the only medium im able to check during sessions.
5Secondly I have never noticed someone occupying the stream. 80% of the time no one is on queue and the few times there is when people actualyl tell me that "hey there is a queue and im up next, ETA?" i have always gone "sure ill wrap up, 10ish minutes ok for you?"
11,02Sumica: It's meant to be fair for everyone else. If we don't have them in place, then what's the repercusion for going over the limit?
Ninjazz: Its late for you,so I would expect that.
:>
09,01you want to stream, but someone who has been streaming the whole day is still streaming and you honestly don't have the heart to tell them you want to stream
08,01i'm just asking the others if they want to take over
/me throws apples at Om in rage
00,10we have had the time limit in place for months. no one uses it.
09,01it's just a way to ensure everybody gets their chance
lol
09,01Sumica, that's the thing
Om: Yeah, I get screwed over with all the timezone shinanigans.
suddenly apples
09,01nobody uses it because nobody has the HEART to do so
Hide dem :(
04Nobody wants to tell someone else to stop streaming
a Stephen Hawking biography, maybe? ;)
09,01I know I certainly don't
OooooOOO!
09,01even if there are several times I should have, for all extents and purposes
00,10So we are punishing because we are nice. Great logic
11,02Sumica: Which is why we're making a big focus this time around and with rules in place. This is going to be the guideline from now on.
;) I love school
Hm...Would that be falling into the public not wanting the certain stream to stop?
OH DEAR GOD NO
wat
So much green
dat music
11,01Found it!
LOL
13that too
Ninjazz: Sure you wana use that term? But yes, timezones get hecticly abundant
05Oujo brings a valid point.
.... Okei Om .. i wont feed ya anymore you annoying.. .... ... DUCK!!
13like i said we generally stay quiet cause what's on stream is awesome
04It's not punishing, it's too ensure everyone gets a chance to stream
dat intermission
still alive would fit with this
dat Shakespeare
Kill ALL the lawyers.
11,02^
Lol
cachi01: I agree
09,01basically that's why we're trying to set up a platform that measures everyone can keep an eye on the time limit
lol
"<Ghosties> Nobody wants to tell someone else to stop streaming" i think thats the choice here
09,01and not go overboard
DUCK?
WHERE?
09,01I mean
except Phoenix Wright
OBJECTION
Airpuff: Your the one that told me not to respond to you.
09,01let's face it
Om: Well... Somehow I see everyone off somehow. And yes I will use that term. :>
13skype group for streamers, and only for stream related things
either we regulate each other or we enforce rules
the "Truth"
09,01when we are streaming, we DO tend to lose track of time
Om: >.> Annoying bastard..
kill ALL the lawyers... except for pheonix
04^
/me contributes
Ninjazz: Brave soul.
/me hugs Om.
^ NewDCD
11,02Which is where the bot takes over.
Airpuff: That's my word, bastard! :D
Mhm.
04That does tend to happen, it happened a bit even before the new year
Shizu: I don't want to get ahead of the schedule, but later on we're discussing having a stream department
11,02It will help keep track of the time
<_< >_> DisApplle> Nothing is wrong!
DAT MUSIC!
kilaal mplayer?
Om: I hate you, but i dont want to be ignored! xD
Damn.
aww it ended
09,01a time measurement program/application/whatever would be the best way to keep an ey eon it
this seems really complicated
Now this just seems like a semi conscius skynet waking up :D
Airpuff: Then don't give me the option.
11,01I need a timer for my bans.
Om: OKei, you are to reply to my messages from so on!
SCIENCE!
MOAR science
:D
Bans?
Skynet if skynet didn't want to rule the earth and just wanted to show you Cosmos.
COSMOOOOOOOOOOOOOS
More Science
09,01I mean
Om: from now on*
space?
Airpuff: Maybe.
1,11It's not punishment if they follow the rules. It's ensuring everyone gets equal opportunity to stream. It's only going into punishment if the streamers refuse to acknowledge our rules. Wrek brings up a good point as well. On-the-fly queues can be a tricky thing, and could become difficult to control unless there's at least one person on it all the time.
space?
I van do that 4 u Nittany_Discord
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
09,01are there any other ideas as to how to make sure we don't go overboard?
05It seems like theo nly reason we are wantign to eforce these new rules are becasue no one got the balls to ask the current streamer "hey id like to stream, any chance you could be done soon/got an ETA?" as far as i remember DCD has only asked me once that "hey there's a queue, id liek to stream" i mean how hard is it to just ask? dont have the heart? then the problem isnt with the streamer.
All right. I'm warming up to this, but what still bothers me is possible drama from the audience...The fact that potentially really good streams may have to be stopped, people would be a bit annoyed no?
Since yer one of my fav. Mods
science is best distraction
^.^ oh how i love the science
Om: Okei.. its better than total ignorance. Thanks Om
/me dusts Nittany_Discord.
09,01harder than you'd think, Wrek
09,01much harder.
Scienes
Michael: OBJECTION mlp is best distraction
;w; you both go away as soon as i was ready for my preshow
alright, Im alt tabbing back to Diablo 2 for a while.
^
11,01People ask me for the stream. SB has done it. I think Sumica has as well.
Rainbowdash- OBJECTION!
09,01that one time I asked you
Bronysith: oops its true :O
09,01well, I asked you like two hours after I was supposed to, ya know
my fault
09,01it's hard, very hard, because you don't want to ruin other people's fun
I almost just want to go back to bed. -___-
08,01actually, i disagree with you there, wrek
09,01makes you feel like a dick.
/me 11,01dusts Meanwhile
1,11Ouju: If a streamer is THAT good at what they do, hell, we could consider inviting them to be a part of bronystate or at least ask them to do a regular streaming for us. Problem solved.
Om: can you go back to sleep without any problems then? :O
08,01it seems that the times when i want to stream are the times when there are 2 or 3 queued
Okay, I'm back. And...oh god, it's Cosmos now...
Om: Making me tired.
if you guys want best distraiction, I suggjest the amazing well written and animated MLP FIM mystery/court incounter beetween ponies and phonixe wright
Wb BallCrusher2000
o hai BallCrusher2000
kinda what i said before. either we do tell each other to stop, or we have rules do it
;)
08,01also, it's sometimes hard to get a definite answer as to who is streaming, and who is curerntly in the queue
this seems to be more of an issue of people not stepping up and asking than something that needs to be addressed with a full rules change
Silverscreen: Ah, all right then.
What about Mars/Ares?
1,11Exactly, Phase4
Mish: u mean turnabout storm?
WAR!
yus!
Well I gotta go to work now. Bye Everypony!
Mish: yeah its awesome
i'd kinda prefer the former
omg
Airpuff: Yeah, aint that hard.
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ME!
Hmmm... how do I change my nickname?
13k cutting that train here, val's segment discusses a streaming department, which my idea of a skype group falls under
Cya Obsidian! Take care, man.
sun eating moon?
BallCrusher2000: /nick
Ninjazz: Not my problem its nighttime there
Om: no reason not to then? :P
bye Obsidian
BallCrusher2000: type /nick (isert username here)
13we are 40 minutes into the meeting, need to move on and soon
Bronysith: thx
09,01I mean, if we could somehow automate the whole queue system, infractions may not be needed...buuuuuuuuuuut I doubt that's feasible, so we'll have to go with alternative 2, as Phase4 said
Om: http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw178_1308491058_furseiseki_lunadontgotobed.png
I need more nomz
Om: Really? What time is it there?
Om: if you're tired
08,01i've fallen foul of this once, when one person told me the queue was empty, i started streaming, then got a "hey, i was going to take over, you bitch" (in politer words) from someone else
04Listen, we can discuss this later
And the other one, which is ponies and...
04When Val is talking
05in fact I urge people to ask me when i stream. that way i 1: know there's a queue and people are waiting for me and 2: it gets easier for me to plan out. "oh someone is on queue. then ill jstu reach next savepoitn and say goodbye"
lol GilDash xD
04Guys
04Guys
crap I forgot the name
04Please
11,02I agree with Shizuka that we should have a Skype group specific to streamers.
if anypony needs me... im killing evil sith
GilDash: >.>
04We need to get underway
Om: :)
04We need to continue
0,5Thank you. -_-
04So
04Save your concerns for now
/me loads the orbital friendship cannon
/me 08,01groans... "not more skype groups..."
I'm "I just woke up tired"
04Let's move on to Fluttercry
1,11We got the basics of that issue down. We can discuss it further later. Moving on to the next topic now.
09,01Wrek: even if you do, it's not easy for anyone. Trust me on this one. And anyways, let's move along
Need help Bronysith?
needs more skype groups
What are we watching?
05,15Okay two points here
00,02colour on!
/me sighs
you dont need to kill....YOU CAN GIVE TEH FRIENDSHIPS
Mish: nah its not online
Seastallion_of_War: Cosmos
11,02Please everyone, stay focused.
0,5Let fluttercry speak!
Om: And now you won't doze off again, you can party with the good denizens here. :)
Bronysith|KoToR: you have to hug him to death
1,11sorry.
05,15Guys. I don't want to be rude but, it's my turn to speak
i really want to watch more of these science... but i need to sleep now
derp chat
Aaaaaaand... it's desynched again. What the hell?
GilDash: I don't party.
rub yer pony dolls all over him
bye everypony! :D
05,15A lot of people do complain that we don’t show enough ponies, and for a brony site, we probably don’t show as much as expected. Personally I’m okay with that, but we have to remember who most of our viewers are no. So my idea is that when it gets closer to season 3, we could start showing mini marathons of pony episodes, no more than 4 or 5 episodes. That way, people would be
5,15getting their pony fix, but it wouldn’t take that much time away from what other people want to stream. The marathons could even have a theme based on pony or whatever else people think of.
Om: Interact then. :p
11,01MOVING ON
valoreins: See ya! :)
Bai valoreins
what exactly is this?
GilDash: You are asking too much.
valoreins: see ya
11,01Phase4: oH.
Bye!
bye valoreins
Om: PINKIE PIE IS NOT PLEASED :[
Bye valoreins :)
00,02?
11,01Nvm.
11,02Please Nittany_Discord, wait your turn to speak.
Im back and im srry.
But Im ok with it...sorry... :(
CYa Val... DAmn.
Molestia....
OH DAMN
11,01I didn't see that everyone had calmed down. Sorry.
Wb Princess_Molestia
Mish: Pinkie Pike can drag my carcas to a party if she wants. Otherwize no.
04Listen
Om: Well, I'm not, because you're doing it. :)
Mish: .. does Pinkie Pie have a part in the party at all then? xD
Om: PINKIE PIKE?! :D
if we want to organize a marathon, that's fine. Discuss it in the TL group and we'll get it rolling from there
04We'll discuss this *later* when Val mentions the streaming agin
04Please
04We need to move on
Ninjazz: I know what I said.
Ninjazz: Wow. :D
ok, i'm gonna come back later... :P
we already have -_-
05,15Then for my second topic, I know we’ve talked about trilogy month (or months) in the past but I don’t think most of us know the full detail of how that’s going to work. So what I’m asking for is what movies are we showing, when are we showing them, how are we picking the movies, and who’s streaming them. I’d like to have everything planned out in advance so it doesn’t
5,15end up like the anniversary with a small number of people scrambling to make everything correct by the deadline.
Uhhhh, Om.
You silly, bro. :D
GilDash: Witch >.>
08,01btw, i'm still around, just not in this chat much right now. if the stream is derping, you can grab my attention by pinging me or pming me
Ninjazz: So *that's* how she gets all those ponies to a party. :D
Ah, good to be back. :)
Om: Eh, heretic maybe. ;)
soooooo........wazzap?
hai PinkiePry
13to my knowledge sumica volunteered to run Alien this week
=D
GilDash: I'm not sure I'm following your trail of thought here. :$
Junker-Kun: awesome *-*
13otherwise, we have a short list of possible trilogies, just a matter of laying claim to one and picking a week to do it
Ninjazz: Not a supprise.
Airpuff: Thx!
Junker-Kun: I get it. Amazing.
11,01Are we showing everything listed?
11,01I thought at one point, you wanted to cut the list down.
Om: Different reasons this time.
Junker-Kun: you drew it?! =O
Attempts were made to get the ball rolling on this, but I was told it was to wait until the meeting
1,11Well, as to HOW to make it work, it'd be no different from how BMN did the Lord of the Rings Salute to Summer trilogy event...
kamehameha
Airpuff: Yep
Ninjazz: And yet...
/me is so tired that can't even stay on his hooves... "hello wverypony! how are ya?"
Om: (pinkie pie drags you to a party and talks to you Of O HAD A MiC HERE I WOULD TALK FOR HER)
hai Magical_pablez94
Ninjazz: I can show you if you'd like. ;)
13it's not a definitive list, just the series we could think of in five minutes during the award show planning
Junker-Kun: You'll be getting another watcher then :$
marrrrrrrrrrrrssssssssssssssssss
Magical_pablez94: Holla! :)
GilDash: Show me what? I thought you were talking about dragging dead ponies to parties?
he just called his obstetrician fat...
*squeee*
Mish: Are you one of Gillysuits nimbers? e_e
GilDash: hi :) i did it, seen?
Hey Magical_pablez94.
om: who?
05,15Perhaps there could be another skype group, and sometime this week they could have a meeting to discuss for sure what series to show.
Airpuff: =)
Om: No.
13https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVKrxhQIDZLdDUwcGlpTG8wT3YzUGhPUlJxV0M4a2c#gid=0
Om: WHUT IS DAT
Om: No. Funnily enough. :D
1,11As to the first point, you do know that there's more than just the episodes to stream when it comes to giving a pony fix, right? Fanfictions can be read, fan-videos can be played, fan-art was a little thing we started discussing at one point....
Oo Hai Magical_pablez94 ! :P
/me hugs michael and Ninjazz
Om: tell me now
Magical_pablez94: :3
GilDash: So I'm starting to attract rogues now.
Magical_pablez94: I thought you weren't coming on today? :S
/me hugs Michael and Ninjazz
/me hugs back Magical_pablez94
Om: Hey, I've no control. :D
Again? :D
Michael: :D that ping fail of mine...:D
PM RP anypony? no ERP?
No.
/me glomps Airpuff
11,01Music with Vi?
/me hugs Magical_pablez94 "Hai, hows your day been?"
05,15Well the reason I bring up episodes is that is the only thing we really lack. Scoot-Scootaloo does a lot of fanfics and we do fan videos in pre shows.
1,11Yeah, there's plenty of music to play as well.
OM: whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhy?
GilDash: ...yeah i know i told ya i wouldn't. i've done my best to be here anyway.:D
11,01Or pony games or games with pony mods?
/me afk
04You have to admit, we don't really do G4
/me is derping %(
11,01There are a lot of fan-made pony games out there.
04But I look upon that with a sense of love, it's kinda become our thing now
1,11Right. So, perhaps in addition to our usual 2 episodes for BMN, maybe give a mid-week episode for them to enjoy or something.
ANYPONY for l4d2?
04But I'm all for other pony things
11,01I could stream Super Fluttershy Land for instance.
00,02"Lord of the ring" i has all 3 on dvd :3
thats better
Airpuff: fucking tiring. i have been walking for da whole day. i went to a comics fair... but it was awesome... there was even some MLP coseplayers..:D
05,15Right I'm not saying it become a regular thing. Just something we could start in August to prepare for S3
00,10been trying to slip in pmvs and such between eps of shows when I stream.
yay
04Or, going off Silver here, maybe we could have a streameer do at least one pony thing as they stream?
Bronysith|KoToR: Sorry, already have dudes to play with. In about 10 minutes
Magical_pablez94: at dragoncon i am cosplaying as crono
04*streamer
11,02Well, to be fair, I do usually stream a pony episode or two sometimes when I stream.
Junker-Kun: mmk
Magical_pablez94: Cool O.o
13in august or september yeah... i see the problem coming back that we had the last time we did a marathon
11,01I do pony videos sometimes.
00,02the desktop ponies seem to make it clear
13namely that people are sick of it by the end
08,01Ghosties: not all of us have ponies downloaded
Magical_pablez94: Well, don't exhause yourself, okay? :S
Magical_pablez94: So it's been a tireing day, but awesome? 6_9
04Not like a show, but just do something pony related
wat
1,11well, if you all remember, when Season 2 started, we did a full Season 1 marathon. I'd say that'd be something big to build up to again for Season 3...
04Doesn't have to be a show
08,01ah, okay
Airpuff: exactly :D
11,01Split the marathon.
05,15That was my concern too Shizuka, which is why I think 4-5 episodes max would be good.
theSHHAS looks... well... awesome :D
13right
Magical_pablez94: .. Aah.. im jealaous :P
04I remember talking about doing like
11,01We should split the marathon.
/me snuggles Magical_pablez94.
Magical_pablez94: I have no sympathy for you.
11,01S1 one day. S2 the next.
04Just a Season 2 marathon leading up to S3
00,02how about 1 or 2 a day
Magical_pablez94: Well, you can rest up now. :)
Dude with his head in bull's...
1,11Hell, have someone do a comentary/Let's PLay of Story of the Blanks. That'd be a hell of a stream.
04Because I honestly believe S1 and S2 would mean that people get sick of it
Om: You've no sympathy for anypony... sometimes I wonder if you're sociopathic...
so much cosmos
GilDash: don't worry :) i'm never exasted when my energies whore off they'll back to full power! :D
05,15Personally, I get tired of it after 2 episodes. But remember who many of our viewers are now.
GilDash: I have sypathy. You just have to earn it.
1,11Good point, Ghoties.
Magical_pablez94: Are you energizer?
I've been meaning to ask, Magical_pablez94. Why did you add Magical to your name?
guys...this is really off-topic
04How so?
1,11How?
if we want to do a marathon
04It's a part of flutter's topic
Om: ok. :D instead, i have for ya. :D
Lol :D
00,02sorry to detour, "Naked Gun" and "The Naked Gun", are they the same thing or different?
discuss it in TL after the meeting
04Pre S3 marathons
Om: what does one do to earn it? xD
1,11We're talking about adding more ponies to the stream.
no one is against doing something
now we're just talking logistics
Ninjazz: cause i'm a unicorn, silly!
04But it's a part of his topic
brb
we don't need the entire team meeting to plan that out
04Pre S3 marathons
trilogy month
before s3
08,01so i just ate 100g of white chocolate
04It's just suggestions
08,01AND I FEEL FANTASTIC
11,02I'm a pegasus :D
Junker-Kun: better than!
Magical_pablez94: Well, so am I, but that don't mean I got Magical infront of my name.
1,11Exactly. We're just suggesting adding them due to the complaints that we aren't streaming enough of them.
/me hugs Om.
Airpuff: next time i'll bring you with me :D
1,11WHich is the topic.
00,024 am, need to go now
08,01Lil_B: i know
Airpuff: You? nothing
05,15I'm fine moving on, it was just a suggestion to see what the team thought and it looks like it's positive, we can work it out later.
Magical_pablez94: nice. xD
1,11G'night, Phase.
11,01Phase4: They're the same.
Magical_pablez94: Wanna be my cell phone battery? =D
Om: I only seem to know how to gain your ire, so that'll have to do. :)
Om: ahaha so im wont be able to get it at all?
funfact: apparently every atom in your body used to be part of a star.
Night, Phase!
11,01Later Phase4
00,02i'll leave my laptop on so it logs
Ninjazz: ... well just dunno anyway... i just love being Magical! XD
back
1,11MOving on to Flutter's second topic, the trilogy streams...
RAWRity: There's not much point putting the word fact next to the word apparently.
00,02skim through when i wake up
11,01SuperBrony64: So am I (as a pony).
I retract my precious statment about sympathy.
Junker-Kun: :D:D is it that crappy?
Magical_pablez94: Can't argue with that. :D
Om: lol..
11,01Pegasi are superior to all other races! =p
GilDash: Its a lot easyer to be angry. Much less to understand.
1,11When I was still around, I had some people discussing streaming tv series as well. Perhaps we could do something to sorta combine the two...or should that be reserved for the whole "queue streams" thing?
Om: Anger is a complex emotion. ;)
SuperBrony64: Same. Where mean old pegasisisisisisis that make it snow like crazy! :P
Magical_pablez94: No. But these new resistive touch screens eats battery in two days. Damn it, my old phone could live up to a WEEK!
Om: ... you're really hard.. to understand..
Nittany_Discord: Dat Suprecist
GilDash: But the means that have it come about are simplistic.
Om: Are they? ;)
Airpuff: Why would you try.
Om: happy hearing you retrected it :D
Magical_pablez94: BTW, having a unicorn as a battery... how would it work? O_o
/me is tired
Om: donno, human nature, want to get more social connections?
04Okay, Shizuka had something she wanted to say, so, Shizuka, please say it
lol
Junker-Kun: magic powers will chrge your phone obviously!
Room is muted?
GilDash: How much do do remember being angry over happy.
Magical_pablez94: No Idea what you just said.

Magical_pablez94: Yeas, but then I'll have to take a unicorn with me... Hey, that sounds kinda cool!
Om: I tend not to remember anything. :)
Ninjazz: :D maybe is cause i'm one of best ponies at using magic :D
13this list, list of trilogies, not exhaustive or final just ideas
13claim one
13or add one
GilDash: Excuses.
Magical_pablez94: Oh are you... :$
13we have more than enough to last the summer i'm sure
Om: you remember angry and happy emotions just as easy Om..
1,11That's a hell of a list.
Magical_pablez94: mmmmmmagic *snort snort*
00,10not realy
/me quotes "[20:03:02] <Om> I retract my precious statment about sympathy."
Airpuff: Sure.
13personally i'd rather make sure they're all claimed rather than set weeks for streaming them
MahBoi777: Please, stop making these references to Mr. Bean -__- My friend will kill me with this someday...
Om: Well, it depends on what I choose to remember. So, theoretically, either can outdo the other. :)
GilDash: I know that as a falicy.
What a story guy posed on a rock.
00,1012 weeks 2 set events so 10 triligys
MahBoi777: ??
wtf
13if they're all claimed then at the start of a week you can just volunteer to stream it
Junker-Kun: lol
11,01Star trek 1-3. You mean Star Wars 1 - 3?
00,10not sure who added James bond to the set events
13i'm getting dragged away, won't be back for some time
hey guys
Junker-Kun: it sure sounds cool...'cause ponies are cool!
Hey alexxm!
08,01i thought we'd already showed Band of Brothers?
alexxm: Hey!
08,01i remember someone streamed it
Magical_pablez94: Hell yeah! /)
05,15That's for the July 4th event
hi alexxm ! how's ur day been? don't answer me i'm leaving :D
1,11And we already did the LotR trilogy last year.
hey alexxm, how are u?
/me hugs Magical_pablez
nope, its because plantes are stupid
i'm good MahBoi777
04I honestly wanted to do LotR again at the end of the event
04Because tradition
Wb alexxm
Magical_pablez94: .. Ponies arent cool.. they are AWESOME
Junker-Kun: (\ ((supper's ready be back in 10 minutes))
And because Hobbit in December!
Airpuff: sorry.....:D
04That too
/me goes to eat
cya l8r
Magical_pablez94: yeah.. better get it right! xD
{
later Magical_pablez94
Magical_pablez94: See ya
Oh Ptolemy, you ignorant slut
/me yawns loudly
cya Magical_pablez94 have a giid supper :)
bye Magical_pablez94
good*
00,10did you want it over the mon-wen or over the weekend like last year?
I'm starting to wonder why I come here.
Cya Magical_pablez94.
Cause you love us, Om. :3
bye Magical_pab|Supper
bye Magical_pablez94
Om: cuz it's quite addicting
CYA! :D
1,11If we're doing it again, then we do it right. The last weekend before school starts, remember? But that's a discussion for another time.
Om: good question.. What do you like about it here then?
04Over the weekend is fine for me, for LotR
00,10oki
buck i lost my phone charger :l
Hi everypony
04We can really get into getting this set up over the week, the trilogy thing I mean. But perhaps we should move on now
Okay, I think I'll go play some L4D2. See you... um... tommorow, I think?
1,11I think we have that set, so who has the next topic?
Om: Show no sympathy, expect none in return. :)
bronystate is addictive
cachi01: .. aww. lame :(
Cya Junker-Kun.
cachi01: that sucks
04Scoot-Scootaloo
no music for me today :(
0,5With partnerships and new members
Michael: this, one million times
GilDash: Never have.
00,03Present
/me nuzzles Om.
Om: You'll get it from me anyway. :)
04Whenever you are ready, Scoot
Om: So why are you here then? Do you enjoy it? :P
DerpSurge: its funny because it's true
00,03Okay
00,03Afternoon, everyone! Today, I will be talking about a possible partnership with Everypony Sings, a website based on composing fan music of the show. Half of the Podcast team are already on good terms with their whole staff, and I believe that we can work together well! Like us, they are ambitious, even going as far as doing their own interviews with people from the show to holding contests on who can make the
So what are we watching?
08,01i drink way too much Mate
Airpuff: Dunno.
08,01i'm peeing like a racehorse all the time
08,01Carl Sagan's Cosmos
Om: You must have some idea? 6_9
Okay, thank you
/me glomps Airpuff
/me hugs Bronysith :)
08,01Airpuff: presumably
Airpuff: Obviously Om's here for my attentions. ;)
/me 08,01gives Bronysith 1,000 glomps starting now
AYA
lol
Airpuff: Probably just that.
i get no glomps?
so much glomps
D:
GilDash: Most likely.. he's not exactly.. welcoming for many.. others....
00,03best cover and such. Needless to say, they have a lot of potential and would most likely help us for our future plans. Not only that, but it will help them as well, giving them a publicity boost for their site. It’s a win-win situation! 
Airpuff: He's not welcoming to me either. He's just *used* to me. :D
/me glomps Derpyty
Indeed.
/me glomps Derpyty
/me gropes Om
GilDash: I guess. xD
(yay O3O)
GilDash: He does atleast answer me now . :D
-_^
Well... That's new...
xD
wow.
Right Om? :P
apparently both tommy lee and will smith have said they would consider taking part in an MIB4
00,03I will now open the floor to anyone who has any questions/objections/praise.
Om: See. I'm not *that* bad. ;)
I dilike being the topic. Be back in roughly an hour.
11,01So, details?
/me praises Scoot-Scootaloo
Can this guy put me to sleep any faster?...
1,11It's an interesting proposition. Unfortunately I haven't heard of them before, but it sounds like they're another group that's promoting the hard work of the fanbase.
Om: Kai.
/me joins LordCelestia
lol later Om
GilDash: only naughty :D
bye Om
Om: Cya soon, buddy.
11,01Honestly, I didn't hear about them until shortly before our interview.
By Om
Bye bye Om :)
Cya Om :P
0,5I remember taking part in the interview with Everypony sings, and they're great people. I wouldnt object to a partnership at all.
cool
1,11and if that's the case, I think this is a good idea.
:p
00,03Brony musicians used their work for their music at one point. 
11,01So they need to popularity boost.
DerpSurge: You don't know what I get up to behind closed doors. ;)
god is made of geometry?
hey RaveBrony
Hey MahBoi777 :)
MahBoi777: wasabi
08,01yet another example of the "oh, me too!" side of the fandom...
That's like the sixth yawn...
04We could possibly set up some kind of meeting with them later
Ramiel is God?
Bronysith: wazuuuuuuuuup
I've got dinner now, so back in a bit. ;)
/me gives Ninjazz pure caffeine
inb4 comments saying "boobs"
nope
Litwick: wasabi
kk enjoy dinner GilDash
Cya GilDash. Take care.
GilDash: neither do you :D
bye GilDash
DINNER
00,03I think I can arrange that
Have fun eating dinner GilDash|AFK
bye GilDash|AFK
1,11We'd be promoting a site that promotes honest work from the community. It's a smart decision that boosts people's opinions about us and our site as well as getting everyone involved more noticed.
MahBoi777: Wanna share? ;)
There it is.
it sounds interesting, i'm all for meeting them
04Okay, so, in regards to Everypony Sings: "Set up a meeting with them to discuss further"
to iron out the details
/me pats MahBoi777 on the back
04Next?
That's what you get.
Ninjazz: Come on! Let me have some fun! :D
GilDash|AFK: STATEMENT STAND! :|
00,03Okay then,
GilDash|AFK: ..go eat.. now :|
Ninjazz: eeeeyup
xD
1,11Alright. Well until we get that meeting, this topic's done with. Who's next.
Ninjazz: I'll be back later then. :p
GilDash|AFK: no thanks
Scoot has more items
00,03I think I still am
04Scoot still
GilDash|AFK: We shall see. I actually might be asleep by then. :S
04New members or something
0,5^
00,03Second, since there are certain departments with too few people, I propose we start looking for more people that would be of value to said departments. The podcast team has had a lot of trouble getting it together with the amount of people we currently have. 
hi Airpuff
Ninjazz: Im having problems staying awake to the stream.. its takin its tall xD
04How many do you have now?
MahBoi777: Hai :P
00,03Also, it might prove beneficial to recruit well known people. One such example is an artist by the name of Valcron being part of the artist department. It could help boost publicity and give us more viewers/regulars/friends
Airpuff: I know right?...
hai MahBoi777
MahBoi777: did u say u were going to want to be part of the brony fukireta parade?
hi Michael
Ninjazz: ... must... stay.. awake..
00,03And we have 8 people myself included
Bronysith: hmm?
Art: 7; Lit: 5; A/V: 7; Tech: 3; Gaming: 4
11,01Uh oh.
hey Airpuff hows your day been
You have 8 people and you're having trouble?
/me gives energy drink to Airpuff
pingas
11,01Some are inactive.
0,5*pinkie pie trombone*
alexxm: It's been good :)
lol
Oh dear...
usual I see
Well, that's an issue with the *people* not the number
lol
11,02Please keep focused LC
11,01AV has more of a communication problem than a lack of manpower IMO.
we can hire more people if there's a reason to, but right now we've got a lot of members. If people aren't doing their jobs, then we might have to reconsider their positions here
04On the topic with Valcron, we have spoken with him and talked to him about joining Art Dept.
1,11A/V?
11,01But that issue is for later.
0,5There he is.
00,03Sorry, laptop being a jerk:/
lol kepler
chat quiet
Kepler... Oh You :3
Valcron is dreatos on DA
Whoa... DOn't keep your eyes closed for too long.
00,03So yeah, floors open again
Ninjazz: .. i know..
Ninjazz: i dipped of a bit, my head slammed in the wall >.<
04With Valcron: He mentioned that he needed some time to think it over
Airpuff: Sleepy hoof (\
:D
Ninjazz: Are you still awake?
11,01Audio/Visual
If there's justification for hiring someone, bring it to the admins and we'll discuss it (like with Valcron)
So whats this nerd talking about?
part of the issue with manpower is people spreading themselves thin, I'm looking at the list and I see a few people in multiple depts
otherwise, the departments need to get their act together
and then someone discovered the other planets AND CRUSHED HIS BELEIVES!
2Wait, didn't the third one just come out
/) Sleepy hoof Ninjazz
lol
omg
if people aren't going to do their jobs, then they don't belong on the team. I know it's harsh, but that's just how it is
TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHER FUNGER!
I'm back......again.......for the 3rd time this week.....
04Kirz brings up a good point, perhaps there should only be one person in one department?
we can't go around hiring 70 people because only 20 will do their work
hello luigifan365
1,11well shit, if you need more A/V work, look to me. You people do know I'm currently and A/V editing student, right? I have Premiere and After-effects available almost 24/7 just ten minutes away from me.
Wb luigifan365
wb.. luigifan365
yes
Hi luigifan365
04Er
Welcome, luigifan365.
Applebloom:Teachers have soul!
04One person should just stick to one department ><
Does RanbowDash taste like rainbows @_@?
Silver; noted
No.
11,01That'll work because we have zero posted interviews because most are unedited.
DuskStarshimmer: ... Skittles :P
Skittles.
Airpuff: (\
0,5Why just one department?
mmm sweet
Again, man.
SHE BLINDED ME WITH SINCENCE!
fail
You have to wonder if, in 200 years, people will look back and laugh at what the hell Stephen Hawking thought he was doing.
00,03Silver, I'm gonna need to talk to you after this meeting
0,5Some people are able to handle it.
Ninjazz: /) xD
what are we watching?
If you spread yourself too thin, you're not going to be effective.
Not so much that Ghosties, but only stay in the dept if you can handle the load and help with each
RAWRity: kno right -.-
1,11Interviews? Shit, i'm in the middle of doing a DOCUMENTARY with 2 interviews on a local busienss. I could get those done in a week.
VIVE REVOULUTION!
0,5But if we have one person to one dept, then the number of people in each dept. will be pathetic.
luigifan365: cosmos carl sagan
REVOLUTION
11,01I'll have to quit interviews or step down from gaming dept lead if we have to stick to one dept.
Heresy!
Hi Irish_Pony :P
0,5With what, 19 people and like, 4 departments
Airpuff: Hi :)
04Then, like Val said, perhaps we should be looking to do some rearranging with the members themselves
That's not a pathetic number
hi Irish_Pony
05,15Yes LC however they'll be able to concentrate on that one department more.
04It's not lack of members
Ohey Irish. Feeling better, now?
/me drinks some jack daniels
Irish_Pony: this .. stream.. is heavy.. just so ya know >.<
drocsid
04Look at Art
/me revolts
04There's a decent number of folks, but nothing is really getting done
^
04Now I understand that there are circumstances
Hey Midnight_Tempest.
04I get that
Ninjazz: not really but drinking Orange Juice REALLY helps :$
Dafaq Im I whatching.jpg
Hi Midnight_Tempest
hai Midnight_Tempest
04I know what's going on, but shit luck or not it's not lack of members
hi Midnight_Tempest
Hi Midnight_Tempest
Irish_Pony: I lol'd. :D
04It's motivation
04Getting it done
1,11It's lack of willpower and getting it DONE.
04Like Val said
She was not a happy pony
Doesnt matter, had lol.
04You are on the team, you should be contributing to the team if you're on it
I think as it now.. we have enough people on the team but we do need to look into workload / positions and such.. which will be discussed later on.
Irish_Pony: .. it does?
The point is
1,11In my case, I'd do it just because I could always use the freelance work and practice for my career.
Airpuff: eeyup...
11,01Also, bringing any new ideas to bearASAP.
/me closes her eyes slowly
04And I'm not saying everyone is this way, but still, when nobody replies to something for the group to do...
04It's kinda discouraging
Irish_Pony: .. im like 90% dead now
Hello everybody! I am here, and I am feeling well rested. I had another long 13 hour rest. Summer break is only 4 days away and I can't wait.
shleeeeeeep
if there is this feeling that the teams have too much workload or whatnot
bring it up in the TL group
Airpuff: wut...??
again, use that group more often
^
hey pikorar, how are you?
COMMUNICATION is magic
hai pikorar
Hooplah.
Allo pikorar.
Hi pikorar ... sounds nice..
Hi pikorar
Irish_Pony: .. seriously sickly ssleep atm -.-
Hey pikorar!
sleepy*
A gold nose????
yes
it's just a rumor at this point
ALL the mods!
Irish_Pony: eeyup
Airpuff: shleeeeeeeep
/me hugs Luna
^
MahBoi777: .. i dont... wanna!
11,01That so much.
/me 07,01snugs Rain
11,01Timely communication.
:)
u know u wanna
Table scraps?
1,11The issue and solutions are simple: If you volunteer for the work, do the work. If it's too much work for you, tell us and we'll either scrap it or find someone else to do it. Don't lead us on thinking you got work going on when it's not even past phase 1.
Luna: <3
/me is half asleep
how are you, Lulu?
Afternoon all...
LOL YOU TWO RETURN AT THE SAME TIME XD
pikorar: I am just fine lol
Allo Dermathil.
/me pokes Michael "dont sleep.."
Hey Dermathil!
just as you went away at the same time earlier
07,01busy dear, i'll talk to you in a bit
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black_3#Potential_sequel
good afternoon Dermathil
ok then ^_^
Hello Luna :)
They say Bartimaeus of Uruk, the Snake of Silver Plumes, crafted Tycho Brahe's golden nose after he lost it in a duel over another man's wife.
/me jumps
Kepler is depress.
Michael: WAKE UP! :[
Hi Dermathil
Airpuff: Well have a nice cup of oragne juice before you sleep :)
Ponies47: NO they must sleeeeep
yay
inb4 nobody gets that reference.
13this isn't what it looks like
FUN MATHEMATICS? HOW DARE THEY, said Kepler-
13I swear
Irish_Pony: .. before i sleep?... i dont want to sleep!
MahBoi777: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5169/
Ponies47: indeed..
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4560/
2The word 'sequel' has lost a lot of its appeal pertaining to movies lately :<
Ponies47: heheh okay
1,11The problem isn't manpower, it's willpower. We used to run this site with only 4 fucking people getting an average of 300 people in the chat at each event. We can do the work, we just gotta get up and start doing it.
11,01It's lots and Lots_of_ponies!
/me backs away from Ponies47
Thank you Silverscreen
Ponies47: i must ... resist
Bronysith: That is basically you in your entirety.
Airpuff: I hate sleep
Meanwhile: eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Indeed, I do, Bronysith.
Meanwhile: yup
He died of fat.
omg
Ponies47: indeed.. feels like a waste of time.. -.-
He choked on a hunk of ham.
He's a fat fatty fat fat.
http://scranton.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw661_confound20these20ponies20they20drive20me20to20insomnia.jpg
lol Bronysith
11,01Confound this insomia, it drives me to ponies.
00,03But we still have to worry about what's going on in our own time. Some of us do half to deal with personal issues that they can't focus all their time on BS
MahBoi777: Whaaaaaats wrong? You don't have to FEAR me! *Makes a really creepy smile*
that's fine and all
Insomia this confound.
Nittany_Discord: xD
as long as you communicate
Confound these ponies they drive me to unprotected sex!
so we know what's going on
and can work around it
Nittany_Discord: so true
Confound this Carl Rosen, he drives me to smart.
Princess_Molestia: i think Irish_Pony wants another round
1,11I know Scoot. Why do you think I've been gone for the past five months. That's why we need to keep communications between each other and keep everyone knowing what the hell's going on.
04Okay, so, result of topic: Re-evaluate how members are used?
NO!@
The only time it's a problem is when someone says they'll do something, and then does nothing for a month
Bronysith: xDD
not now
04I'm not sure how to result this topic
take some SPOIL THEN SOME TURD AND STACK ,A SPOIL TURD STACK XD
Irish_Pony: .. Safe. xD
*phew*
:D
04Because I'll be honest
foolish ponys im back!
Irish_Pony: Unprotected, but fun?
the: hi
Meanwhile: maybe......
Hello the shortest name I've seen in a while.
PIERCE THE HEAVENS
discord :[:[:[
04It was being considered, cutting people from teams, because as Val has brought up when nobody says anything then nothing gets done; we don't even know if you're okay or not if you don't talk to the dept.
That feeling when you realise you have mathexams the next day 6_9
I just love love love ponies! :D
is there anything on the stream
hai kamina
Hi the! I love you!
00,03I think this goes hand in hand with communication. We should be able to elaborate on it on later topics.
04Communication
Supa zoom.
04If you don't talk
04We don't know
He said Celestial!
communication more or less is the main item for this entire meeting
12Pixar sequels
Orbits are Elippses and Kepler could not except it
12fff yeah
Yay.
it keeps returning
dat feeling when u dont lsten to music.........
11,01Mine turtle! *explodeS*
When is this movie over? :(
Ponies47: hi
Dropping hints probably isn't a good idea either. And yes.
it never ends Ponies47 O__O
this movie will never end
1,11We keep talking about it, but how do we fix it?
Ponies47: never
Hey hey hey kamina
OMG ITS Q
never, we will watch it again until we are all smart
11,01Funny how communication is my only topic.
Dat Q
11,01And it's at the end.
04Like I said, it was being considered cutting people from teams
lol Q
1,11Here's how:
1,11Lay out what we want to do, which department does it, and who in that department gets the work.
04But everybody is against that
0,5Because, Ty...
AKA orbit
1,11IF there's an issue, tell someone about it.
discords back foolish ponys :[
0,5Even if the problem isnt numbers
Hai Q
1,11It's people.
04It's the motivation
*Facedesk*
Midnight_Tempest: i dont want to be smart i just want mah music
0,5Those who are there have potential
04You are in the group
0,5If they are removed, then there is less potential
04You are there to participate, guys...
04If you're just there
12!pokemon
Soital, you are a 6Watchog.
The area of each is always the same.
04And not doing anything...
1,11It's not potential if they don't do the work.
04^
potential is useless if it's not utilized
cachi01: well, you can always just turn off the stream... people that dont like this dont have to watch it :P
04^
04If you're just there, and you don't do anything
04Then yeah
11,01What Silver said.
Thou art notified that thy kind hath infiltrated the galaxy toofar already. Thou art directed to return to thine own solarsystem immediately
04You're kinda seen as dead weight
when does season 3 come
04Just anything, please
Midnight_Tempest: i want mah music :l
when does season 3 come
04That's all I'm asking for
04Give us something to work with
lol
Midnight_Tempest: but mah phone is dead :l
the: Fall
the this year
never
11,01I'll bring up my concerns at my time.
Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 taught me everything I need to know about planets.
NEVA
ABSTRACT? BUCK YOU
Midnight_Tempest: this day will be boring :l
There's an admin in every single department group
when does season 3 come
Will you stop interrupting me? I mean, this is hardly atime to be teaching you the true nature of the universe.
if there's an issue
say it
the: Fall
what mounth
/me is steamed
pikorar: u have learned well
that admin will bring it to the other admins
Whenever I pay attention to this show I feel like I'm looking at the TARDIS.
the: eventually
and then the admins will do something
Nobody knows when season 3 is being released.
we can't do anything if we don't know
the: never, they cancelled it

1,11Right.
00,03That being said, I think I'm done with my topic.
04Alright
Alright
Ok.
04So, result: BETTER COMMUNICATION
04TALK MORE
Dr_Who Who are you?
arggggggggg
04Next?
Lil_B: im the dr
the: Why do you keep posting the same thing 3 times?
00,03Don't be a Fluttershy!
moi
arggggggggg
the: Or more :|
Ponies47: why not?
dat arg spam
Dr_Who Dr Who?
1,11Next I think is the topic of BronyCon, isn't it?
We love each other here! And ok! :3
04Ah, Luna
Lil_B: just the Doctor
nope
1,11oh, sorry.
BronyCon will come later
don't worry
Dr_Who: Idk
04Luna is next
./) Gravity (\ So abstract
/me has never seen Dr Who
"Knock knock!"
!pokemon
1,11Luna, you're up.
.... anyone? :'(
nope
Alright so this was a crazy idea I had to fix the streaming issues and our currently shadowy business with the content we stream (movies / series and what not)
/me has never enjoyed Dr. Who.
Airpuff whos there?
The candles they light up nothing!
Midnight_Tempest: hello
Lil_B: Doctor....
Lil_B: same here
Dis coooooood
What if we would create various sections on our mainpage with general info about the department and maybe even a department themed stream
He said harmony and discord in the same sentence. He is a brony.
Airpuff Dr who?
there is a videogame s dr wh right now
Lil_B: ..Yay. xD
that way we could provide original content
Art > art stream
did the dr leave?
there are many dr who games
pikorar: ikr :D
gaming > live games
omg
Airpuff Dr Yay?
really? never seen any
oh shit
Lil_B: No.. dro who ._.
a dr who game?
Audio > podcasts / interview playlist
yeah for ps3
A PORTAL TO EQUESTRIA just appeared right next to me
sure it did
brb
/me stands next to Bronysith
/me enters portal
it sure did buddy
And I'm princess Celestia.
it sure did
/me goes with bronysith
/me comes back through portal
/me bows in Ninjazz hnour
well that was quite jolly good
So my idea is have seperate streams on the mainpage, because we are more than just a streaming site.. we have a young team and plenty of excellent ideas and talents.
Ninjazz: and im Ninjazz !
Airpuff wait... You confused me ._. now I have to think :/ wether or not Your name is Dr yay ore Dr who
Blooming dark ages.
Bronysith: Turns out that was actually a portal to Narnia
hey look, big Ponys
Why didn't they just make loads of candles?
./discuss
Lil_B: Dr who, you silly xD
:$
RAWRity: wrong. narnia is lame
Im soo glad I exist in a logical society
wat
(that was point 1)
False Bronysith, if you went to Equestria you wouldn't come back because you wouldn't want to.
11,01Separate, simultaneous streams?
And she sold drugs.
yes
Airpuff what is your PhD?
What.
/me stays on equestria
Lil_B: PhD? o.o
Meanwhile: back then drugs were REALLY bad, mmkay?
so the first question is for the techies is this possible?
Airpuff you sid you are a doctor ._.
what's with al the sciencey stuff today?\
multiple streams going on at once... so the viewers can choose what they want to watch?
RAWRity: Dark age drugs are best drugs.
05,15I like the idea, my only concern is that would mean more chat rooms to cover.
it is Luna, we've actually had this discussion before
he visited luna
00,03^
Lil_B: Doctor who.. is the doctor?...
lol
omg
Maybe we can use LiveStream for streams like that? Like links to the LiveStream place
11,01We don't need a chat room for every stream.
i heard celestia
^
Airpuff YOU ARE TEARING ME APART Airpuff !!!!!
^
I want to become a space man to see Luna and Space core
If they desperately want a chatroom that is and ahh true
i cant believe all of this started with some ponce coming into chance witht hte name dr_who
could open up a side room if needed, we have 6 extra
1,11We don't need separate streams to show diffent forms of content. the beauty of streaming electronic media is that it can be any media. We have discussed this before, and the answer has been "now."
Dark age drugs involved cutting off people's limbs. Good times
04How many streams are we thinking, though
Bronysith: lol
Lil_B: Im not teasing! I was trying to get to Doctor who!!! XD
1,11no*
/me hugs Airpuff
Princess_Molestia: are u ready yet?
rescue luna!
Bronysith: just absolutely woderful wasnt it?
05no more livestream usage unless its a must
04But I do agree with themed streaming, and a page for each department
05soon we wont even be able to use it
not yet, give a minuet
04At least a page for each department
/me hugs alexxm back :P
Funfact: Pregnancy tests in the early 1900s actally involved killing rabbits.
@Wrek there are other platforms too
Airpuff I thouhgt you are Dr Who... so Why do you try to get to him?
personally, I dislike the idea of having streamers competing for viewer attention, with that being said: I'd like to see everyone's opinion on it
RAWRity: wtf
1,11Livestream pretty much loaths us at this point.
04Hehe
RAWRity: sounds lovely.
Lil_B: ....
RAWRity: That doesn't sound fun at ALL!
00,03I'm afraid that it would mean competition
funfact: my brain is full of fuck and i love it
1,11^
Lil_B: .. no.. im not Dr Who.. i am airpuff, and i pulled a knock knock joke to get to doctor who! xD
1,11That's the issue, and that's the purpose of queue streaming.
funfact: i like pie
I think having 1 extra page would work, but use it strictly for dept streams
052 things i can think of is: 1: wont it casue stream competition and 2: what about those that stream both art adn games?
Bronysith: They would take a blood sample from the woman, inject it into a rabbit, and then if the woman was pregnant, the rabbit's ovaries would expand until they burst.
why is everypony pinging me?
Funner Fact: Bronysith likes pie.
/me knowed it all along Airpuff
Ohai funfact
/me glares at Lil_B ..
Nobody likes a funfact.
1,11Kirzstryfe: There's an idea. Having one other room for theme streams and have a different theme depending on who gonna stream that day.
05,15I'm not sure about streams. But a page for each department seems like a great idea, and for things like the gaming and podcast pages, you could just have recordings.
I just heard thunder
/me glares back at Airpuff
09,01yeah, I don't think we should invest in such a setup. It would be a logistics nightmare, for starters. Additionally, there's the fact that our viewerbase is limited enough as it is.
Storms a comin
Hey GabeMoist!
dat epic music
1,11...
hai GabeMoist
1,11Why not just make a Youtube channel for this?
I'm falling asleep!!!!!
Ohai gais
DISCORD IN HOUSE
RAWRity: Jesus. Who the hell found that out.
Lil_B: Im not the one who made me explain something to somepony who knew all along! :|
Okay, what next.
...That's an idea...
hai DISCORD
Hi DISCORD. I love you.
Mine ISNT WORKINg :(
Meanwhile: scientists
who want play truth or dare
yfw we have a youtube channel but it's not being used atm
I keep hearing Chariots of Fire in this
a page for each dept, but have it link through the same embed swapper for content
RAWRity: For science. Right, of course.
stfu DISCORD
Hi DISCORD
04We have a YouTube channel
stfu bronysith
I'm getting no stream O__o
Airpuff I know, I'm good at playing dumm : D
1,11A collection of Let's Plays, Podcasts, Music all promoting different artists through playlists that link to their respective pages.
Discord Lord of Chaos
00,03We are starting one for the Interviews, maybe we could link our own youtube videos on the main page
Hey hey hey DISCORD are you here to doom us all? :O
Only credits are playing DerpSurge.
Dermathil: did u make a vid for the brony fukireta parade?
Oh wow xDD What's it called? Or is it just called BronyState?
yes yes i am
there is no stream, bronystate is currently experiencing a drought
00,10this come back to the frontside embed swaper that we talked about at one point.
Lil_B: .. congrats you tricked me! :D
the stream dried up
DISCORD: :O
Credits for credits?
Airpuff: To be fair, that's not hard. :p
04Wait
aww My first time here and theres a drought FUCK My life :8
Starting one?
We already have one
Hi GilDash|Bath. You takin' a bath?
1,11We could put an embed on our page in BS witha link to the Youtube page, and swap the embed out at regular intervals.
*sumons evil zombie ponys*
GilDash|Bath: shaddap xDD
04Why not just use the BronyState youtube channel for this stuff -_-
OO linux
DISCORD: u mean blood hounds?
1,11Ghosties: I think that's the idea we're getting at.
Dafuq.
Ba ba ba ba she she she she ba ba ba ba :P
So, what's next on the menu?
What? Someone here is named DISCORD? lol IMPOSTER!
Airpuff ... really... I actually thought you would get it :/ or are you the one now who wants to trick me?
11,01Q: Why haven't we started the interview YT channel?
blood hoofs are scary
05,15The BronyState channel could just have playlists for each department
sends zombies at cachi01
Lil_B: What?! xD
05,15You upload a video, and sort it to the playlist
Yo Dog, I hear you like credits. So we put an intro credit for the rest of the credits. And we gave you partial credit for the credits
/me eats DISCORD's zombies
/me kills all the zombies
04^
yummy
1,11^
04Have separate playlists for each channel
That sounds like a good idea.
/me becomes a zombie and starts a lil' zombie family.
05it wont work for art but for podcasts and game streams, having a separate place on the site for those. where you can go games>genre/streamer>lets play quake 1 which then is a link to the youtube OR even better, on site play
kicks cachi off earth
04For each dept, I mean
*Flys away from DISCORD*
/me eats DISCORD
08,01okay, SB is gonna take over the stream now
That's it, I'm done.
08,01thanks for watching
Good night.
yay :3
YAY :)
1,11We don't discriminate either. If someone has something they want to add to the "Music" playlist or the "Let's Play" playlist, we let them add it.
Night Ninjazz.
Airpuff just be aware that I can read you like an open book... I'll keep an eye on you... like a hawk... or rather, a griffin
SuperBrony64: u gonna play some ssbb????
SuperBrony64: play super bingo on the stream
08,01hoep you enjoyed the Science!
/me 11,01fills up with water
05,15That's how my personal page is, I have tons of playlists sorting my favorites and uploads
For Art, we could post some speedpaints or video tutorials?
thx for the stream :D
Night night Ninjazz
I always enjoy the science
^
that's a possibility
Gnight Ninjazz
Lil_B: ... wat... who... what?.. When did...... :s
Vi's radio stream was another possibility
Airpuff sorry :/ i think I'm going insane over here
/me 08,01sets mode +b on Ponies47
lights chat on fire
we link to our dA page each week...
05,15Lit could have fanfic readings or reviews. Every department has something they could add
it's just not being UTILIZED at all
1,11The radio stream could feature the playlists if VI is willing.
Lil_B: I have no idea what you are trying to say! xD
Hai everypony!
lol..
Hi |Discord|
say wut
11,01We also have an unused tumblr.
Hi |Discord|
Hey hey hey |Discord|
Hi |Discord|! I love you. There's some sick, disgusting clone of you here.
...
we have both
Airpuff ok :/
11,01And a barely-used facebook page.
It's actually getting worked on Nitt
but yea we are going offtopic
DISCORD: Ah we got a inposter here don't we?
hai |Discord|
11,01OK.
08,01pikorar: it'd be really boring. it's just me sitting in front of my computer chatting with other mods, BUCK committee, and writing e-mails to inland revenue
so yay or nay?
0,5Nittany I will be discussing social media soon
11,01K.
Lil_B: ... What are you trying to say then? xD
04Alright, we're veering off
05sure if we want a lib with speedpaints and i guess i could try a hoof at making tutorials then sure. I would jsut need help organizing and how to actually make the vids in the first place.
0,5And yea Luna
Hay, Bronystate, why not stream Alice in Wonderland?
04The social media thing will be discussed in a bit
lights ldiscordl on fire
hi |Discord|!!
05i disagree we are still discussign the point at hadn ghosties
or Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory.
DISCORD: Bro, I am the TRUE discord. You can not beat my awsomeness
/me gives water to |Discord|
funner isnt a word pikorar...
04But we won't have anything for social media, Wrek
hey DuskStarshimmer hows your day been
cachi01: Thank you my dear friend.
hai DuskStarshimmer
1,11Luna, this is a good idea. We can turn the BronyState youtube channel into our own gallery of Brony Community videos with the various themes for each playlist.
Hey hey hey DuskStarshimmer :)
00,10Guess I was the only one that liked the idea luna had.
BRB
05,15I say yes to individual pages, but I'm hesitant on the streams.
discord has no freinds hes cahos
Ayoo alexxm, hows my bro doin?
im the real discord
it's just a crazy idea
but we can discuss the details later
'Allo Michael and How be its Ponies47
DISCORD: Get with the times man. You are to old school.
just needed to know if you like it or not
04Yeah
00,10*headdesk*
i'm goo dDuskStarshimmer
only 97 more views until my DA account has reached 1,000 channel veiws :$
04I'm also hesitant to streams
00,10a meeting to plan meetings
11,01Me too.
i'm good DuskStarShimmer
ALL IN FAVOR OF ME BEING REAL Discord SAY "I"
1,11The only issue is...who the hell is going to manage all of it?
Irish_Pony: link it hre i wanna help =D
14the pope is gone
14FINALLY
alexxm, good!
14too many people around x_x
Airpuff I tricked you you in explaining everything to me because i Played dumb, now you are playing dumb and want me to explain everything to you, but thats not gonna happen, even though thats just what I'm doing wriht now, so you won, you are good Oo
the tech part or the setup or the managing?
I
each department would be in charge of their own channel
14over a milion
and then tech makes the magic happen
brb
each dept lead would be responsible for managing the page, with help from tech to set it up
^
Und then chat was playing dumb.
this is not a democracy.
Meanwhile: playing?
Lil_B: .. i really had no idea what you were saying.. before now.. but okai xDDD
Bronysith: Ok fine,.
Und then chat was dumb.
we are an anarcho-synd.... no, wait, I suppose we're not that either
Are you happy now?
Ninjazz|Night: G'night if you're still watching. ;)
Nittany_Discord: Hey bro is there anyway I can reserve this name?
anyone care to play gmod sbep? Gmod SBEP anyone?
04So each dept would have its own YouTube channel?
1,11If I manage to get those interviews I'm doing done in a good enough time, I could easily start setting it up. Ghosties, as for social media, we're kinda stuck at just using FB, Twitter and such as our means of marketting until someone gets a better idea for them.
Airpuff I believe you, I often speak convoluted :/ it's worse when I'm actually speaking
05,15no a playlist in the main channel
GilDash|Bath: Just about to fall asleep.... Thanks for that.
Lil_B: xD
Oo
dat feeling when u eat all ur chips and u have no music and u got owned in one in the chaber after beating everyone up..........
@silver ask bronystate

|discord|
04Okay
|Discord|,
|discord|
04So
DISCORD: You even failed at typing my name
Y'know
|discord|
Ninjazz|Night: :$
1,11That said, We can move on to our next topic.

Night GilDash|Bath. :$
Night Ninjazz|Night
04Hold on
I've discovered recently that I really like Green Day.
04Themed Streaming: Not sure, hesitant
Ninjazz|Night: Sweet dreams. ;)
04Page for departments on site: Sure
any1 here plays or has played lineage 2?
GilDash|Bath: I don't have dreams.
GilDash|Bath: .. how are you.. bathing... while you are at BState??
04Possibility of using BronyState's playlists for each dept. video stuff
04Okay
04Now we can continue
Airpuff: I'm not yet. Just hoping I don't flood everywhere. :D
magic Airpuff
only for curiosity
Ninjazz|Night: Well, you know what I mean. :)
GilDash|Bath: ahaha okei
Airpuff: He has technology
Airpuff: Magic *snort* *snort*
GilDash|Bath just don't flood the chat you you will get banned for spamming XD
next item is a simple one
Artist's Spotlight Page; What's the status on bringing back our Artist's Spotlight page?
GilDash|Bath: Of course, night.
04NEVER
04Er
/me is looking at the techies
*ahem*
/me kisses Ninjazz|Night goodnight.
04I think Val worked on that too
mentlegen
Lil_B: i c wat u did there
Lil_B: ya DISCORD learned that the hard way
sup man
I was thinking on that, rolling it into the art dept page
It was a topic of mine, yes
Hai ScootaChicken
hai ScootaChicken
SuperBrony64: Moo....
Ninjazz|Night: Dream of many. Blue Ponies with hats
Und then Chickens which Scooted.
we promised it to the viewers, so I'd just like to see what the status on it is
Hi ScootaChicken
05could I get a fill in on what the spotlight actually was?
1,11The Artist Spotlight can be brought back with that "Theme" idea.
lemons are pretty cool
they make lemonade
Yeah
Lemons are very sweet picked straight from the tree.
Which is Pretty fucking awesome
I remember making lemonade with the boy scouts
was highlighting the winners from the first art contest, if I'm thinking of the same page
You mean girl scouts.
Ah those were the days
O U
yes
Besides, Girl Scouts are called Guides :P
that, and the fanfic contest
jailbait can be girlscouts too
the only thing I hate about lemonade is that it burns my throat afterwords :p
I did not know that.
Consider me enlightened.
I never was in boy scouts. :( I thought it was a dumb idea :|
00,03...wut
that you are
:$
So, any of you guys like Green Day?
Heya Scoots :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl5d15lokaY Blametruth is so awesome
00,03Che!
OHAI BRONYSTATE!
I liked Greenday, back when they were sorta newish.
well my dads girlfriend is intrested in seeing the show
00,03And yes, BlameTruth is awesome~
05kind of developing the spotlight a bit further
Scoot-Scootaloo: Nothing you just go back selling your chicken....
Allo Pinkies4thWall.
Hi Pinkies4thWall
hey Pinkies4thWall hows your day been
11,02Moooooo
Coke > Lemonade.
Oink
SuperBrony64: MO@
11,02I'm not going to be streaming right now
I liek lemons
05,15I actually had an idea about that. Rather than doing more contests. People could send in their art and stories, we could look over them and make sure they are passable. Then put them up. Kind of what Wrek just said
Do you like lemons
GTFO, lemonade has lemons in.
hai Pinkies4thWall
SuperBrony64: COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO! :D
Old Mcdonald had a farm, E I E I O. And on that farm he had a SuperBrony64, E I E I O.
Must be better
prince-lemon: NO WAI
hai Scoot-Scootaloo
pretty much wat EqD is doing?
my dad turned off the net last night when avatar was 50 miutes in so i was so saddlesore(butthurt)
prince-lemon: I see you're still keeping your nick lemony.
If life gives you Melons, make Melonade
11,02I'll be trying to stream the Pre-E3 Show for Nintendo though at 3 PM PDT.
prince-lemon you serious?
lemons are the best fruit to grace this earth
With a moo moo here and a moo moo there, here a moo there a moo everywhere a moo moo, Old macdonald had a farm, E I E I O.
SuperBrony64: yay thx =D
prince-lemon: what's your thoughts on Pink Lemonade?
When you put it like that it sounds bad. XD
/me hugs prince-lemon
04Gives Seth more reason to be like
RAWRity: its pink
04"LOL, UR JUST COPYING US"
05,15Why not? Gives people another place to put their stuff. But yeah now it sounds bad
Suddenly RAWRity
Pink Lemonade. Is that like a Reverse Nacho Hoof?
hai prince-lemon
ScootaChicken: I've been here for over an hour
SuperBrony64 well you be able to make countdown for them?
/me hugs everypony who said hi.
Its like the taco of lemonades
I believe it's better to have a spotlight for one person a week
05well to an extent. isntead of draw friends. we jsut feature an artist for a week with maybe an iamge of theirs. and a link to their DA. givign the smaller artists some space aswell
MOO, SuperBrony64
RAWRity: Lurking powah to the max?
we post it in a new topic called "Artist Spotlight"
oh hi Pinkies4thWall
hey Pinkies4thWall hows your day been
ScootaChicken: I've been talking to people
04That is true...
/me works on his Abraham Tank
05same can be done with fanfics, music.
But RAWRity, you're antisocial.
04Hell, Seth already doesn't want to have anything to do with us if previous interactions matter
RAWRity: Meh, I've not been paying attention to the chat
0,5I know the guy who managed the second largest pony art group on dA if that helps at all.
I'm going back to my Protocols, only 5 more to go. If you need me, ping me, I'm still sitting next to the PC XD
Hey, mods! :$
alexxm: it just got good. my dad turned on the internet for the house 7 minutes ago.
04But still, we need him for promoting us as best stream for new eps
Meanwhile: No, I'm just incredibly grating. There's a difference.
04At least for now
Lil_B:
00,03OH HAI!
Oh right.
pibg
11,02Lil_B: Probably not a countdown... ><
*ping
hey DerpSurge hows your day been
Hi Scoot-Scootaloo
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo!
/me glomps SuperBrony64 and brushes his mane
Scoot-Scootaloo: Hai, I have a question. When I go to regestier my Nickname it asks for a password...but a password to what?
hey Scoot-Scootaloo hows your day been
05,15To be hones I haven't been to EqD in a really long time, does anyone know the general quality of what they allow?
/me hugs Scoot-Scootaloo and brushes his mane.
00,03A password for you nickname
SuperBrony64 too bad :/ I always miss such things because i don't know whats the time in MEZ

As you all know i'm sick and i'm having a hard enough time trying to skim through SRS due to the amount of OFFTOPIC messages
11,01Pretty much Skype.
so I heard Bronystate needs more explosions
11,02O.O
*Explodes*
/me nuzzles Pinkies4thWall
/me hugs Litwick ^-^
Nazi Photos are best Photos
oh
hey, SB, do you know when the Sony confrence is on E3?
this is the part Nittany_Discord is supposed to explode
*Explodes*
SuperBrony64: hi silly filly :D
04For now, Skype is just easier to communicate
1,11That is a good point. I myself just browse past and ask what I missed at the end of it all.
11,01Same,.
WHOAH
Rain`: they will just talk about playstation all star battle royale :l
04So if you really want forums utilized then that means we ask others to go to forums more
WHOA
04But then
11,01Even if SRS stays on-topic, I can wake up to a 100+ message queue.
/me rolls on the floor
04That probably wouldn't happen :/
11,02Rain`: 6 PM PDT Monday June 4th :)
Doppler Effect?
^_^
E3. Meh.
Well, Skype might be easier.
/me licks SuperBrony64
1,11I think that, if we are to use the forum, we should use them as a place for final discussions and final decisions, that way we don't have to bother cutting through the bullshit to know what's going on.
Because clearly our communication is terrible.
inb4 it does
00,10cool way to show the science
04It doesn't, but people will use convenience if they can
As that comes up time and time again
The Situation Room
MLP FIM Music, y u so good and catchy!?! I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THEM! 6_9
Sumica: agreed.
science *snort* *snort*
05an idea would be to move SRS to the forums. and stop using SRS in skype. having the SRS of skype contain say "please put this IP on the ban lsit cause im streaming" or minor srs matters
Da Fuhrer.
i know someone whose dead works for microsoft. soi he gets a free e3 press pass every year. lucky fucker
*dad
In de Fuhrers face.
/me rolls on Sumica and SuperBrony64
11,01Or to post movie night winners.
/me rolls in a circle on the floor
11,02O.O
05aye
*Rolls on floor and hums*
well my dads girlfriend is intrested in seeing the show
I wonder if that'd work on caht.
/me slaps sense into SuperBrony64
chat*
Well we used have a thread on the forums for sort of 'daily' BronyState events that people should know about or be read up on.
alexxm: good for her!
/me crashes through wall
But I don't think it was used much
OHHH YEAH!!
04Yep
SLAP
bitchslap
04It's not used much
1,11the SRS skype group seems to be only usefull during emergencies and when we need instant communication on an issue.
alexxm: What show?
/me slaps Meanwhile
04So then
Maybe we should reinforce the use of something like that
Ow.
/me slaps everypony in chat
04Have a SRS SRS group
SLAP FIGHT
/me explodes from slap
I regret wondering.
|Discord| my little pony
druuuugs
What?
Ninja Post: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/21402779.jpg
no
/me avoids Irish_Pony slap
not another group
how did that feel Meanwhile
1,11No more skype groups.
/me slaps Irish_Pony
1,11No. More.
0,5To be honest I prefer skype over the forums
i like her painted on tie
Most of us live in different time zones.
04Everyone probably does
11,02:<
11,01More skype groups are bad.
*SLAPS EVERYPONY*
alexxm: Like being clocked in the chops.
Ponies47 I am aslpoded. Can't help you.
Chrysalis: XD
We need somewhere where we can read goings on without all the crap
/me slaps the RPers around a bit with a large trout
SuperBrony64: hey my love =D
11,01We don't need a SRS for SRS.
1,11Exactly.
So I'd say a forum thread.
/me slaps Ponies47 hows it feel
/me avoids Ponies47 slap
also
As we used to have
/me hugs Baka-Neku
05,15I say keep using SRS they way we do, but log really really important stuff in the forums
Trufax ScootaChicken
Which is updated with the daily events
alexxm: Bad :'( I'm sorry :'(
The RP is very annoying.
And which everyone should read/update
ScootaChicken: hey love =D
1,11What fluttercry said.
/me slaps Irish_Pony and Ponies47
/me is slapped
05assign someone to post the daily list?
Tell them that she secretly had an affair.
/me hugs Ponies47 sorry about that
honestly whats the point of RP?
is slapped :'(
That'll work.
the RP is incredibly annoying
just be yourself man?
Keri can bust my myth anytime.
I dunno...
A slapping robot. I need one of them. Installed at my door.
Wait, what?
what myth are they trying to bust?
/me 11,01feels like +m ing the channel for RP
they are building a slapping machine?
have you ever been so mad that you built a faceslapping robot?
The amount of which I am annoyed is too damn high.
Nittany_Discord: do iit
*Hugs alexxm* It's ok :)
Hmm
Hairy arms.
1,11I'm going to be busy regulating the Youtube thing, so the daily list won't be something I can keep an eye on as well.
Dem soundeffects.
imma slap you so hard. WITH MAH ROBOT!
O_O KARI'S GETTING SHAVED
Is anyone else getting some random YTP and buffering moments?
Dat pun
I SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE!
Nittany_Discord: can easily be done just voice everyone and devoice the rp'ers
11,02Hai Baka-Neku :)
11,01I don't mind one-line things.
Slap the bass.
I can't believe we're finally here.With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is starting to make this the Best Night Ever!
04Okay, so
hai Baka-Neku
I think there's a problem with the stream.
Spank-o-meter
Is that homer simpson?
11,01Or two-line.
SuperBrony64: how are you too day
04How about
11,02I'm good ^-^
11,01/me isn't RP. /me interactions are.
Fine I won't sing :'(
/me hugs Baka-Neku
Bam hands.
It's either randomly buffering or jumps a few seconds ahead
2!pokemon
2!eonget
Ran, you are a 10Skorupi.
/me hugs SuperBrony64 back
oooh this slap is PAINFUL
2:3
Smack.
horray
04Keep using SRS, but use the forums for the most important info and direct everyone there for the finale of a discussion
rofl
dem slap
04That way both SRS and the forums are used
Backhand
1,11Exactly.
Double slap
Pimp robot.
what do the vast hoofs say to the face? SLAP! :d
i like this show
11,01K.
I need that for an alarm clock
04OKAY, next
If this is going to work we need to be pretty strict with checking/posting information to the forums though
1,11If thats the case, we should be using it to record the decisions we're making right now.
INB4 WEED
Right in the eye!
Dey gon' get drunk?
Now increase the force to match a crocodile bite. :3
Their pain is amusing.
BOOM oh no
lol
That hand acts more like a fish, than an actual hand
advert why is there an advert
04That's why I'm also cataloguing (however you spell that damn word) the results of each topic
Almond Joy is gross.
Meanwhile: is /me rp'ing?
Commercials? NOOOOOOOOO
04So that way it's easier to go back and just pick the result of each topic
is this streamed off the TV @S
!pokemon
I'm guessing this is being streamed from the T
uh oh
*TV
are we watching tv?
Pinkies4thWall: Depends on the context.
/me wishes I was a pony
Alright last point
05wait
Pinkies4thWall only of you interact with someone with it
Best candy is NOT Almond Joy! :[
thast over 90!!
05luna
051 last thign
It
/me cries
go ahead
shut up kid
It
Troll kid.
Why? Being a pony would suck. I'd rather be human anyday.
Basically, stuff like /me hugs x person is alright.
05I do think it would be "easier" or atleast more attractive to use the forums if it was located on bronystate rather than on zetaboards
LASER! :D
But prolonged interaction via the /me command is RP
/me Twilight: You're such a good father. How bout you and me give Nyx a sibling *looks at Dusk with bedroom eyes*
08,01can i make a suggestion: how about we keep all our canonical info on a wiki? they're dead easy to set up; i could have one going on our NFS in about 10 minutes
/me hugs Ponies47
04Then users would be asking to join
/me 11,01slaps everyone with a wet towel.
It's also annoying as fuck.
Fun Fact: The highest recorded psi in a human's bite is multiple times higher than the strongest bite recorded on a shark bite.
*Hugs alexxm*
Oh, ok now i klnow what rp'ing is
YES, SMASH THOSE TROPHIES
ooh nice Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: Since when was BronyState a locker room?
the forums as they are now are only meant for the team
1,11Yeah, that's a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad idea.
Eddmario: Thanks for sorting out ScootaChicken's point.
08,01weren't we going to include public forums as part of BS2.0?
Painful and refreshing
that ad seems legit
Nittany_Discord: Oh were gonna slap like that are we?
D'as one dumb dude.
we have a item for that later
05we were iirc
00,10was what I though at one point as well.
05ok lets wait with that discussion then
OW! Nittany_Discord, those can cut you know.
TODO:
need to update overview sheet...
need to update rules
need to update infraction document
update FAQ with summer newsletter info
Eddmario: That's RP.
The singer for the new Free Credit Report band looks like Johnathan Coulton
Just need folks for this to step up and do it
11.•10«11WB10 (Kosoveon10) 11WB10»11•. 10- since the aforementioned eggs aren't even fertilized
02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosoveon> caution, the banana drops are poisonous
It's also annoying as fuck.
05what is the overwiew sheet?
department overview sheet..
00,10oh you all just realised this was live tv?
05,15Johnathan Coulton would be a fantastic Free Credit Report guy. Just sayin
Now the question, how long before one of the Mythbusters die?
inb4 he dies painfully.
the FAQ seems like a Lit Team job. Flutter, can your team handle it?
oooh dis is gunna be gud
ooh you streaming the new ep?
I'm back from my dinner but i gotta go to study...so act as i wasn't come back! :D:D
Eddmario why not brian blessed
00,10new to me
Wb Magical_pab|STUDING
I made someone bleed by whipping him with a wet towel once
PinkiePry: Ow
Michael: u maybe ain't get it...
Sumica: how you do this?
Pinkies4thWall: Ow
05Updating the rules seems like a team job aswell. I could help with that.
Scale room with a scale explosion. Now that is pretty cool.
00,10capture card
I NEED FOOOOOD
BRB
05,15Yeah the FAQ is no problem.
okay then. Wrek: can you get a group of people together to do that?
Me and a friend played bloody knuckles until our knuckles litterally started bleeding once.
BTW, the italics thing I said earlier was a slighly modified quote from my scrapped fanfic, specifically the sex scene.
11,01I'll capture your card.
Sumica: how much did it cost?
Fluttercry: excellent, I'll ask for updates during the mini-meetings
04I don't want to leave out those that were there last time
04So myself, Super, and whoever else as well as Wrek and...whoever
05I'd love if shizuka and an admin were helping with that if possiblwe
brb
04Myself and Super would be there
04And we're both admins
04In fact
04I'm the leader of the Rules group
Nittany_Discord thats a little personal there
00,10lowend usb ones runn 10bucks highend HD internacards with lots of nifty make my recordings look nice software around 300
04So I *have* to be there
00,10mine is some where in the middle
05,15I was about to say, don't we have a Rules group in skype?
04OH YEAH
04We do
HOPEFULLY
11,01I was in the rules group on Skype.
04We have a rules group
Bamf.
Alright that's all for my items.
1,11The Infraction document would also fall under Ghosties then, wouldn't it.
04So then everybody in rules group and Wrek and Shizuka
1,11Since the two kind go hoof-in-hand.
That explosion matched the explosion in my head when my mind was blown.
04Yeah, the stream infractions would fall under Da Rules group for updating, but we obviously wouldn't include that in the public rules
05the reason why i picked shizu is due to her having handled the rules previously
transducer
05if she wants to that is
doink!
05always this ^
/me has a tower of beer cans in his room
drama data
DOINK
04So then the Rules Group would handle updating the rules, I'll make an appointment tonight
im back
with cukis
04May we move on, Luna?
05as i feel right now i feel like begining tonight even, we shall se.
Welcome back cachi01
This'll be fun.
Does robot hand have to slap a myth?
Welcome back cachi01. I still love you. And your cookies.
04I can't do tonight, I have a test
11,01How much would a good game capture card cost?
04Do tomorrow at noon
05okiloki
04But anyways
04Luna?
11,01If it's cheap, I could get one to stream PS3 games.
yea lord celestia is next
pikorar: lol yay!
A DOUBLE RAINBOW!
04Alright
1,11LC, you're up.
they should make a catch and make the person sitting press a release button. :D
0,5Alrighty

04There
04Alright Bacon
Nittany_Discord: whats your psn?

A
0,5So, my idea for a new team to handle social media matters
11,01My PS3 is broke.
oh
Nittany_Discord: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFf
11,01So if you add me, don't expect to be added for a while.
SuperBrony64: how much did your capture card cost?
11,01I know.
I'm back.
I'm front.
Nittany_Discord: http://www.roxio.com/enc/products/game-capture/console/overview.html
Welcoem back pyrocatboy. Love you.
i'm middle
Nittany_Discord: Do you have LBP2?? Perchance???
11,01I have the first.
Nittany_Discord: Aw :(
Ah yes our PR needs to change
04I had an idea for that
Hi bronystate.
oh cool, live TV
0,5To begin, allow me to say that this is only an idea I've had recently. If we want to keep putting ourselves as a team out in the internet, social media sites are obviously useful. Now, I understand that the Literature Department handles this stuff (I think) but since they have other things that will need to be taken care of (becaue of our future plans) I thought "Hey, we could have a
0,5and then orders the rest of the team to spread out and go put the posts onto the different sites... or no leader, and the team just shares all special information with eachother and then make it a responsibility to get the things out and onto our sites. People who would go into this team would be those who are working on the tumblr, whoever manages our DA and Facebook pages, and whoever is
Allo FillyFlam.
0,5willing to watch over other sites like twitter, ponysquare, etc.
hai FillyFlam
Hi FillyFlam
05HOLY F. ok reading.
Nittany_Discord: I've had an XBL friend request pending for like 5 days. Just not busy on Xbox?
Hi FillyFlam! I love you!
Hiya FillyFlam
04I really agree with Bacon and I have an idea to help
03=.=
pikorar: ...Thanks, I guess. :P
Meanwhile?
04May we speak freely, Bacon?
Chrysalis.
0,5This could make social media management a lot easier I believe.
Shepard.
huh, your not I_h8_trixie?
Wrex.
God I love old cars......
0,5I dont think I have anything else to add to the text wall at the moment, so alrighty, you can speak.
Chrysalis: No. I'm not.
03I'd go back to sleep but it's already almost 3:30 LOL
But I love whoever is.
I have PSN
Mythbusters? AW YEAH! :D
Irish_Pony Don't we all...
I'm barely ever on the PS3 though
00,10nitt you could probably get somthing close to what I use for around 40-50 depending on how and who you get it from.
04I would like the creation of a PR team, as Bacon said, and...well...I'd like Scoot-Scootaloo to lead it
My names crazzytus on it though, if any of you want to add me.
1,11Back when we first started, I made it a big routine to go from Facebook, Ponychan, Steam, and Skype to spread the word of BronyState. I also made it a big deal for anyone to spread it anywhere as much as they could You're asking for the exact same thing on a bigger scale.
0,5PR ?
00,10the real issue and you would have to talk to SB on this is HD input.
inb4 drunk
1,11Public Relations.
0,5Ah
11,01Pinkies4thWall: Not really. My Xbox isn't broken. I just don't play it. I also don't have a paid account.
Dat stock knuckle crack
11,01So I can't do much except chat.
0,5Now of course, this would probably involve making *dun dun dun* a new skype group.
00,10I recall SB had a strange interlacing look on some ps3 games coming from them being in HD
1,11Hell no.
0,14I'm behind this idea, I made a mention of something like this last meeting and on the forum post for this meeting
1,11This could easily be resolved by talking in SRS
04It would mean a new skype group, yes
04No, it can't
dem stars
04Things get lost in SRS, Silver
That's odd, i've got my TV set to Discovery Channel right now, but this episode isn't what's on
No, it would need another skype group
05dedicated people for PR sounds like a good idea.
04And PR is crucial
0,5Whats the big deal with another skype group?
05,15yeah, I agree, PR is really important and it would make sense to have a team for it.
04It's just a dedication to communication is needed
0,14the Skupe group would only be for the people in that department right?
oh wow......
Nittany_Discord: that's what i do with every brony from here. chat.
These guys have the BEST job ever! I want to be one of them! :S
He's asian... Of course he's good at math.
dat math....
00,03It really is important to have one, since we need dedicated people on it
05since it would basically be a new department a new skypoe group is ok. while for a SRS SRS its not.
11,01Agreed.
Frosty.
chilly
inb4 they forget him.
Shiver his timbers?
04The skype group would need an admin in it to oversee, just like the rest of the depts
0,5Wow, I honestly didn't expect everyone to be happy about this idea.
And he was never seen again.
04I've been keen on it for a while
I_H8_Trixie: I rather work at RoosterTeeth
0,5:>
IceRamen, I can see these flying off the shelves
04And like I said, my candidate for TL is Scoot
11,01LC, it's organization and advertisement.
1,11Well, considering I was pretty much THE marketing person back when BMN started, I guess I could lend a hand. Of course, that means adding me back onto the Facebook page.
00,03Unless anyone objects, I accept~
xD
LOL :D
DOHOHOHOHO
04I wouldn't mind Silver being in it, but I'm only curious as to how long you'd be there for
oh god
CFFFFFFFFFFFF
00,10falling on your plot should end the cordnation test
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
04You mentioned that you would be here for as long as Summer
04That's why I'm weighing out options
0,5As long as you can work with us Silver. I mean, the newsletter posting is my job already.
1,11Good point.
11,01I used to play equally with Xbox 360 and PS3, but it's fallen to the PS3 now. I'm not even playing my 360 while my PS3 is broke.
Ducky!
/me 11,01quacks
xD
Results are, you suck.
04And Scoot really seems to get around and know people
lolwut?
04And he's really enthusiastic
im playing ps3 while on the computer
Slapping a man who has an impaired mind is going to be fun.
and y bro is using the xbox
Smak im!
Except SaxyPretender, who i hope to one day play ace combat with
Bam.
04So if no one else has any objections to Scoot and a reason to be, speak up
Uhhh
11,02It was interlacing because I was using Composite, which only supports 480i
04Otherwise, BRB, spaghetti
1,11I'm not going to lie, the whole process of creating the newsletter was a pain in the ass when we first came up with the idea, but I'm really, REALLY happy with the final result.
/me smacks Om.
this isn't grant's best day
i almost feel sorry for him. almost
heh you can't compare the old newsletter with the current one..
i dont feel sorry for anyone
1,11No, you can't. XD
GilDash: Not sure if its good to see you back...
xD
the heck do you change your name?
show me your warcry!
11,01I don't remember our pre-2.0 newsletters.
Om: Of course it is. :)
Jump up and hit something.

They should have released live bears into the testing grounds. That would get his adreniline going.
At this rate he's sterile now
pony_494263 you type /nick first, no spaces
ok
his pain is so amusing
11,01I'll have to dig through my old e-mails.

anypony know where i can get a good capture card and for how much?
GilDash: Whatever you say.
Hey Kids! FLARE IS BACK! :D

1,11PR is mainly getting people interested in what's going on.
events and contests are things teamleaders should be discussing in the TL group
Is this just Discovery Channel, or is it one of it's alternate ones?
0,5Uh
since it involves multiple departments
0,5Like I said:

ScootaChicken: One does not simply be original.
alexxm not bad
Is he a law inforcer or sumthin?
Meanwhile: You forgot the quotation marks. :D
Midnight_Fyre, Midnight_Tempest, now we've got Midnight_Splendor
ScootaChicken Perhaps Luna is a favorite?
Oh, my: http://www.highestfive.com/wp-content/uploads/kari-2.jpg
GilDash: I'm sure they're professionals.
ScootaChicken: There is only two ponies with Midnight in their name.
Biglaw: I know I like Luna. ;)
Evening everypony
Allo Yokupony.

Hi Yokupony! I love you!
Hello Yokupony!

TheRainbowDash: Never met Midnight_Fyre?
Myth Bustas
That's a shame.
I like him.
Meanwhile: Professionals, perhaps. *Experts*... not so much. :D
wat
ScootaChicken: Okay, maybe a little more than that.
00,03Eddmario -_-
*Hugs everypony especially pikorar :)*
hello Yokupony !
GilDash: You are an expert water poisoner.
Midnight. midnight everywhere.
NO POSTING HUMANS Eddmario!
Om: No. I'm in training. ;)
you get a ping from Flare, you are automatically poor.
HIMNAMIN!
Anything else LC?
D'ooh! Thank-you Yokupony.
pikorar: Pffft! You do it all the time. :D
GilDash: Ah ha! I knew it!
0,5One moment
btw, Mythbusters is awesome
MODS ASLEEP. POST HUMANS
Isn't a hynemen the part of the female reproductive system that rips and bleeds the first time she has sex?
Om: That doesn't mean I'll actually do it! Geeze...
But I only do it when the mods are asleep, GilDash, there's a difference.
GilDash: pikorar actually strives for that goal.:D
Mods are asleep, post pon-oh wait.
pikorar: Not in my eyes. ;)
GilDash: Right. Whatever.
xD
Ponies are asleep, post mods
Eddmario: 1. *hymen 2. Why the fuck would you bring that up
Eddmario: lol
0,5One more thing I want to mention: The people in this department would need to be members of at least a few of our social media sites, or have one or two people assigned to a specific site, and then have them work on it / manage it, which I meant to say earlier.
Mods are posts, sleep ponies. Wait what?
Trolololol
Meanwhile: xd
oh Meanwhile
/me takes out GilDash's eyes, rubs them on his shirt and puts them back in. "Can you see now?"
Vaginas are asleep, post vaginas
...
wtf
We need a test on Nazi window technology
Let's not.
Sleep mods are, ponies post
00,03Eddmario, control yourself
Boot to the head.

Eddmario, calm your hormonal rampage.
pikorar: I see a fool. ;)
LOL
1,11And I could make an Ponysquare account in a snap.
11,01Facebook, Tumblr, Steam.
XD
doesnt matter if its a reference
00,10wood roof
I was referencing a LittleKuriboh vid
pikorar: So I guess that's a yes! :D
11,01Same.
0,14I'm on FB, twitter, G+, dA
Oh criminy.
DAYUM!
Eddmario: i met him
00,03Xbox live...
oh shit......
0,5Well Luna and I already do a good job of running Racebook
Yes GilDash, we all see Eddmario acting like a fool.
0,5I
0,5I
fail
11,01Ponysquare seems redundant to FB though.
0,5crap, dumb enter key
Like always.
pikorar: Tsk, I meant you, silly. ;)
you're responsible for what you post, don't particularly care if you're trying to reference something
TEHE
Alright, I'm back from taking a piss. What'd I miss?
GilDash: Shush, you. :).
That proud feeling when you're playing TF2 and made someone ragequit.
We were talknig about you.
PonySquare is build on the same engine however PS is a Brony network
*Talking.
lol FlareChaser how?
0,5If we get ourselves out there more, the more publicity the better
11,01I have a YT as well.
dem derp eyes
05i suggest gettign someone on cludslade.org aswell
0,5And what better way to do that than with a team of people behind the task
pikorar: Make me. ;)
0,5cludslade?
05its a good way to spread casue it has many bronies on it
pikorar: Its a trap!
HERP DERP SHMERP

Eddmario: i met little kuriboh
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
LIEZ!
Om: Thank you, Adimiral Ackbar. :D
PR could look into ways to expand our reach / interesting partners for us
FREAKING LIES
Am I going to have to gag you GilDash?
for now and the future
dang son...
pikorar: You can try. ;)
anything else LC?
what
0,5Yes, one more thing
00,03Maybe we should focus a lot of our attention on Brony social networks, since we ARE a brony wepsite :P
05its basically where u can make a "cloud" this cloud could be bronystate themed. and people could "join" this cloud or follow it for info.
1,11I'll handle the YT account, the FB page and the PS page.
GilDash: That isn't my name.
05ill give more inf oon it later
05sorry
00,03web*
dont even start you too
0,5New Social Media (PR) Dept.: Yay or Neigh?
yay
11,01I can handle the Tumbr and Steam.
Om: What am I going to do with you? :)
1,11Yes.
/me gags GilDash. "I will not fail! I am an apex predator!"
00,03Yay
Didn't you post that here around 12 hours ago Bronysmith?
11,01Yes.

GilDash: Continue to pick on pikorar and leave me be?
05,15yea
RAWRity: I hate them.
0,5Excellent!
yes
RAWRity: exactly the same as mexican adverts just in english
This commercial needs more friction.
0,5:D
11,01I'd say it's unanimous.
Hey all
Eddmario: my name is Bronysith
not like your own country ads aren't as terrible as ours
You think he's picking on my Om?
I hate this weekly game of cards.
Hi Randomnerd
pikorar: You might want to tie it tighter next time. ;)
0,14calm down there
Cox? Was Puss-E already taken?
:D
RAWRity: still better than italian ads :D
xd
pikorar: I'm not your Om?

Om: Now, that would ruin all the fun. :)
TAKE DAT SUCKA! BOTTED
SaxyPretender: ace some time next week?
*Booted
0,14sure
seriously, with how many people you guys have youd think youd be better at making stuff
Chrysalis: well, you're getting the repeat of the local ads
Me, Om, I meant to say me. But you can be my Om too.
pikorar: Aw, he's your Om too. :)
pikorar: No. No I cant.
1,11Good. That out of the way, what's next?
Shhh, Om. I love you.

stream etiquette
Streaming is an integral part of Bronystate. In the past, we've had issues with people attention whoring in the chat and in general being a nuisance. I'm not saying this is an issue again, but we need to be careful about this. When someone is streaming, it is our responsibility to show the streamer the utmost respect. A lot of times, certain mods will distract from the stream's with
-_________- My whale is bigger.
their own agendas. If the chat naturally migrates to content away from a stream, that is fine. However, no mod should ever be responsible for drawing attention away from a stream. It's down-right rude.
I wanted to bring this to attention
/me hugs everypony :3
Inb4 a giant whale.
(-_- )< Fishy!
PLEASE watch yourselves while in the chat
hehehe go cameraman
it's vital that we always give respect to our streamers
xD
Well this seems safe.
I fear I have made an error.
inb4 911.
What error?
does anyone have any comments to add to that, if not, I can move on?
Meanwhile: ikr
the blue screen of doom?
Om: You spoke. There's your error. ;)
05not sure what your point is. just "dont attention whore in chat please" or do you want os to comments on soemthing specific?"
GilDash: Would you preffer it if I didn't.
=0
Om, you came on Bronystate. That's it.
yes.
XD
...now im hungry
[This comment requires a BronyState Gold account to view]
No matter what you say about the US, there's one thing we have over the UK: we don't have to deal with Jedward
FlareChaser: goodie
who wants a slap
Keep your actions related to the stream
..... ._.
pikorar: LOL CaME on Bronystate
1,11pretty much that, Wrek.
/me slaps alexxm
God that makes me hungry
Princess_Molestia: ready yet
this is why we've started getting more strict on RP
Alright, 5 more minutes and I'm offline.
05ok no furtehr from me regarding that
jeward?
pikorar: Thank you capitain obvious.
/me slaps Bronysith hows it feel
I made tehRequital|Drawing ragequit
FlareChaser: Even I wouldn't make that a joke. :D
because it's distracting and disrespectful
RAWRity: Jedward are Ireland's problem, not ours.
not yet, ill tell you when
GilDash: :3 I would
I must work.
alrighty, any other questions/concerns?
Bronysith ready for what
Om *captain -- Another error.
In maybe 10 Minutes.
Herp derp face.
Bronysith: What was the email again?
11,01Stuff related to the stream is OK, though?
of course
pikorar: Yeah, Omffee is terrible at spelling. :)
11,01And if the streamer allows it?
Kari and Tori must have rock hard nipples.
it keeps the chat focused on the stream
Cobellanez: it was flutterisbestpony@gmail.com
pikorar: Oh look at that. I'm all out of care to give.
Princess_Molestia what does Bronysith want to know your ready for
1,11Yeah, like the discussions we had conserning chinese medicine and martial arts during Karate Kid.
WE GOT A TROLL IN HERE.
alexxm: dont ask........
alexxm: I know I am.
you know
1,11It was related to the stream, but kinda distracting.
Om: if this was a movie it would be: pikorar and the Quest for Fucks to Give.
brb time for moar food
supersora dont we always?
MAIBEH.
11,01We have a lot of streams going on, so we can't do away with idle non-stream-related chat.
05that actually doesnt bother me too much silver. i think its more about if someone is streamign a game then i go in to link my latest image
11,01But I understand purposely drawing attention away.
Fucking pedostache.
yeah, I was more refering to what Wrek said
Hi, Good afternoon everyone
MicTheSpectator.. hello mic
hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: heyllo
Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT! I love you!
heya TGAPT
brb
hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT hows your day been
Allo TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
pikorar: If this was a movie I would be the dead extra.
okay- anything else regarding this?
ponyremix: Hello. I just arrived 2 minutes ago.
No, Om, you would be the love interest.
ponyremix: or did you just join?
pikorar: It'd end in five seconds, because I'd be right there with you. ;)
MicTheSpectator.. i just joined
1,11oh yeah. I was *this* close to kicking that idiot that kept posting that stupid pic on Friday.
what would i be of this was a movie
No Hitlers, kay.
pikorar: You high?
ANYPONY UP FOR L4D2 anypony at all?
Now stop
pikorar: If this was a movie, I'd be the star
im back with carls jr
hatin is bad
ponyremix: Fuck it, my fanbase is getting lazy.
Bronysith sure
00,10think of it as off site advertising and posting videos, ask the streamer first
Bronysith: PC or Xbox?
GilDash... I'm afraid it may become a porno. :(
speak now or forever hold you peace
Now I need some freaking burgers...
Hilters are unneeded. if you are a hilter U MUST DIE
and yes, exactly sumica
alexxm just woke up and i have a headache aside from that good, and yours ?
pikorar: We can keep it tasteful. ;)
Literally.
I'm high on lovin' you, Om.
MicTheSpectator.. so what are you doing
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: u up for l4d2?
love and tolerate hitler
*is hungry now*
We're slow-cooking NC Style Barbecue tonight.
pikorar what would i be if this was a movie
alright, moving on
Bronysith: Only have Xbox :(. Getting a PC soon
ponyremix: It should be just around OBVIOUS.
Bronysith uhmmm ok
/me walks away
Where are we going? This is an important question. The admins have been pushing for integration with BronyNation. We want to create something valuable to our community, something that brings the community's focal point back to the users (heh...Tron). With that being said, I want to open up the chat so everyone can express just where they see Bronystate going and what they wish to get
out of this.
You would be the guy who asks stupid questions, alexxm, lol.
00,10this should be good.
Meanwhile: you up for l4d2?
ponyremix: Watching a livestream.
pikorar: Or we could always fade to black. There might be a *lot* of fading to black, but... ;)
Holy crap.
Bronysith: Eh, maybe in a bit.
ponyremix: Having to work soon.
and by chat, I meant this meeting
om is a ghost!
MicTheSpectator.. work sucks
so, where do you guys see Bronystate going?
Bronysith i have time
11,01Details of BronyNation.
11,01?
sure
GilDash, it would just be black, with moaning noises. For 2 hours.
Lil_B: whats ur steam id?
boom
FIRE IN DA HOLE!
I think hes dead...
BOOM
/me hugs Bronysith
Damn you, Hitler!
pikorar: ... I'd be completely fine with that. ;)
Bronysith "Red Baron"
BronyNation is essentially going to be a conglomerate of major brony sites that put emphasis on community projects and creations
ponyremix: It doesn't if you earn money for things you love doin'. For instance i love doing Jackle.
Y U so hard 2 kill?
so for example
**I mean music.
if someone were to make a new pony flash game
they would post it on BronyNation
They should have gotten a guy dressed as hitler to be hitler.
MicTheSpectator.. and you make money off of doing jackle
Hehehe, chrome pony, now haters will have to move to IE
it intends to be the end all Brony media outlet
IM SO JELLY
Hitler uses god mode
Lil_B: theres 1000 of those
Lil_B: add me im Bronysith
so, what are your thoughts on this?
Where? on DA?
Hitler just respawned.
Ikr.
Rest of planet goes FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
MicTheSpectator.. best job ever....
00,10lol the roof poping off.
ponyremix: You have.
11,01Who's aboard so far?
boom
04Wait
ponyremix: NO idea.
04Hold on
0,14how close would the integration be?
your face when i use IE by choice
Roof must go, his planet needs him.
theSHHAS: That's good for a first try
yay!
/me hugs Bronysith
Two guys, one garage...
00,03I assume this would take a long time
04We can discuss who is in and who is not when we get to Slurry, since he also has it
ponyremix: Music's good.
04Because BN is going to take a while
Clue: WWII edition: Hitler in a bunker with a cyanide pill.
GilDash ew
MicTheSpectator.. you use FL dont you
04But for now, like Val has mentioned, it's to discuss where BN is going
EEEEVERYONE does.
.....
pikorar: Maybe we could do a Bronystate version of Clue! :)
Ty...
if you read the pastebin
04It's on your thing
04I read it
11,01Where it's going is up to who's in the know.
....hmmm..
developers for web do not count, they have to live with IE by choice
Eddmario
04And I read over Slurry's too
Bronysith done
you'll see we combined Slurry's BN thing with mine
GilDash did it!
MicTheSpectator.. lets see you, yoav, glaze, jackle...
wern't you kicked?
04But Slurry's BN comes later
GilDash: pikorar in the stream with a live bear strapped to a big stick.
04Unless you want to shift his to be the first thing that comes up
1,11Guys, relax.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: so...whatcha doing on L4D2?
cachi01: Whoah, what? :D
I have no idea what happned
Jackle: Alright. Off of the computer. No more r34 for you. We need to get starting.
It was Molestia, in the throne room, with a-I better not finish that sentance if I don't wanna get kicked.
/me is calm
lol
mMmm. Mac and Cheese.
I mean.
pikorar: Who did you kill though? ;)
Goodbye.
Yokupony: they are better than east european ads :D
Nittany in the stream with the banhammer.
I need to please.
11,01Lol.
MicTheSpectator.. is it true that glaze is a woman... just wanting to confirm a rumor
pikorar: That sounds right. :D
*leave
I killed alexxm, GilDash. Just kiddin' I love alexxm.
pikorar: Shit! Canada is the one who get's banned! :O
well, there's no sense in dividing the topic into pieces
FlareChaser dunno i though there was going to be a match but no one else has launched l4d2
05so we shouldnt post our thoughts?
we should just get it all out now
Bronysith how many we got?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I MCOMING! D:
ponyrimix: Go listen to the big smile project and you'll know
What are you talking about?
why can't brian blessed do this advery
/me 11,01dusts MicTheSpectator
ponyremix: The rumor is in fact true. GLAZE IS IN FACT A 'MARE'.
CREDIT WIPEOUT
Let's just discuss it now, since Val's already on that topic
L4D2 was released about 3-4 years ago!
/me hugs pikorar
..........
ponyremix: 1. Have you even listened to a single vocal track he's done 2. I've met him IRL>
shocked
Does anypony want to play L4D2(Xbox)?
glaze is a mare?
/me hugs alexxm with a live bear strapped to a stick.
then who sings rainbow factory?
Nittany_Discord: Thanks, but I don't have time to clean.
AIR DELIGHT LOOKS FUCKING GOOD
So, which is his true name, "glaze" or "Wooden Toaster"?
8,6I find it amusing you all think MicTheSpectator isn't an impersonating troll
how does she...... the voice..........
Wut
CeilingKirz: I do think that.
Eddmario: glaze
THATS NAWT TRUE!
That text color makes me want some pink lemonade...
CeilingKirz: sup man u up for a l4d2 vs
DAT2 1MP0SS13BLE!
Sumica you streaming said new ep?
okay, first and foremost
CeilingKirz: I think that.
where do you see Bronystate going?
11,01MicTheSpectator: I haven't been sold that he is the real Mic from minute one.
ponyremix the same way Tabitha St. Germain or Kathleen Barr does male voices
thoughts, put them here
now
8,6can't right now Bronysith
mythbusters!:D
lol
11,01I mean CeilingKirz
Wub wub wub
okay CeilingKirz
Nittany: I thinks this is getting old.
Oooh...
8,6there's also the fact that I've kicked the guy before for trying to impersonate people
i'm truely surprised...
0,5Uhm
A slap to the face can mean jailtime for domestic violence.
00,10new ep is like 8 hours from now
Hey bronystate!
08,01as far as i see it, we're looking to be a host for fandom-created brony content, yes?
guess i'm running my battery down to 0 power
1,11Yes.
Hi BlazeAngel! I love you!
yes
00,10I have no clue if I would even have the stream then
Look I don't need to prove anything. I can't. It's the internet.
08,01and not just a host, but above that too
Leave it be.
pikorar: O.O
0,14I see BronyState expanding a little, not exactly the center of the Brony-verse, but we have our place
pikorar: Depends on how hard you slap them. ;)
0,5^
08,01with critiques and advice from experieneced creators
hey BlazeAngel hows your day been
it's possible i might gain access to an outlet in like half an hour but not sure yet
SMACK EM HAAAAARD
I'm really pissed at your superstition.
00,03So Mic, I just spoke with you on Skype and you told me you were NOT on the Bronystate chat. Care to explain?
alexxm: Fine.
alright i'm leaving i'll see you guys later and your freaking awsome mic... peace
05my thoughts on bronynation: a fantastic idea. and i support it fully. but it requiers long planning and no rushing whatsoever. i also dont want it to forget where it came from. id rather we slowly turn bronystate into bronynation rather than just one day flip the switch. giving us time to perfect the new elements as the yare ready. a perfect example is back when we discussed the art
5speedpaints and lets plays. If we end up having to quit streaming shows and new episodes on brnoystate because our other elements gets to big. then we can switch that to another place to keep bronynation out of trouble. but we still link it when we stream and such. but thats a detail we should take when it arises.
Great after slap face
pikorar: Also depends on if they're asking for it. ;)
Shits gone down.
Busted
ponyremix: Goodbye.
I wouldn't mind a slap from you GilDash.
I need to leave too.
/me slaps pikorar.
00,03Sure you do~
Piko must be insane.
eeyup
MicTheSpectator: I think you should answer Scoot-Scootaloo's question first.
11,01That was one thing I was wondering.
/me slaps GilDash hows it feel
That was my face, GilDash! Ow! Fuck! That hurt!
BYE EVERYPONY!!!
11,01When BN comes into being, what happens to BS?
I'm fairly sure all of us want to know the answer.
Told ya.
Bye ponyremix
bye ponyremix
By ponyremix! Love you!
Sup.
Slap.
he left
love you two piko
Bye
bye ponyremix
Confir- confir-med.
08,01i'd reckon we'd keep it running, but try and keep it as separate from BN as we can
Yes..
pikorar: Be more specific next time. :)
lol
08,01to avoid potential legal issues
11,01I think this was a topic during the last meeting.
Then you should be Hitler. He can't die.
I miss Gamer_Luna :(
11,01Yeah.
Anypony here play Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition?
alexxm: I think I'm used to it. ;)
11,01But we'll need more people to run both sites.
/me hugs GilDash
08,01if BS gets a C&D, we wouldn't want that to bring down BN too
Eddmario: i so
i do*
to clarify
/me hugs alexxm.
...
05,15I want to see Bronynation happen. I'd love for us to become one of the top sites in the community. But I do not want to see Bronystate disappear.
and mic has left the building
Eddmario i believe most play the pc version
we fully recognize BN is something very far away
Om: Hello. Why're you hiding? ;)
in addition
/me has a tower of beer cans in his romm
/me has a tower of beer cans in his room
this is why we're making partnerships with other sites, like 20% cooler
GilDash: I wanted the cake in the kitchen.
Knowing you, GilDash, I thought there would only be one kind of place you'd slap a person.
because they will be a part of our BN idea
GilDash loves the Rarity emoticon ;)
08,01well, what kind of timescale are we talking about here?
0,14again, how close would the integration be? would all the sites be merging into one or would we all carry a certain banner?
Duh!
So, have you guys seen that Lyra plushie that's going around the webs?
05short version: I see bronystate flower into BN in time with added features and such. stripping away the potential legal issues to a separate place.
It's Rarity! ANd it's the winky face!
eeyup
pikorar: I'm teasing you, silly filly. ;)
Eddmario sadly yes
Eddmario: -_-
ded
DerpSurge: It's kind of a requirement. :D
Would make for a pretty cool beer cozy
Eddmario: yeah :l
Yes! Mythbusters!
as for timescale, it would be small steps at a time
probably a year or more
3 more slots for l4d2 versus
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-put-on-your-brave-face.jpg
1,11Bronystate has been and should always be for the brony community. We aren't MEANT to be the all-in-one mightier-than-though place, we are meant to be what we can be while still having a connection to both the artists and the viewers. Bronystate has done an okay job with that, but BronyNation is meant to take it to a higher level. The youtube playlists and the Artist Spotlight are the
1,11beginings of this concept, and we can grow on it until BronyState fully transforms into a major Brony Community icon.
08,01because i remember us talkin gbaout this near 6 months ago, and so far as i can see, there's been absoltuely no progress on it, apart from some abstract discussions with other sites
Knowing my luck I would be just a random hobo who had his house 2 feet away from that.
XD
What.
pikorar: Doubtful. I'd take you in before that. :)
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeg
WHA?!
I'm pretty sure the flames would kill anyone
Still have 3 slots for the L4D2 versus... somebody interrested?
im a programmer not a web writer
BULLSHIT!
08,01is there any kind of timetable set for milestones, both conceptial and practical, so far?
Yes, because every hobo has a plane ticket to the United Kingdom.
Lil_B: PC, right?
its because the door blew off, releasing the pressure
anypony for L4D2? 3 slots left! PLAY WITH FLARE!
;3
BlazeAngel yes
8,6^
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-all-of-those-childhood-dreams-wasted.jpg
Lil_B: Maybe later. :P
Oh... The credits...
can we kill hitler now
If they collapsed the bunker...
BlazeAngel ok
Flarechaser, are you one of the guys who makes TF2 VSH Bosses?
1,11The difference between us and other icons, though, is that we keep a connection to the community AS A WHOLE. We con't discriminate, we don't put ourselves above them, we don't let personal ideas and affections get in the way, we don't put them down because we don't agree on an opinion. We treat them equally.
Everything needs more explosives
Eddmario: ....maybe
then whats wrong with your little pony mind ?
man, they're so happy about Hitler surviving
Like the stream.
no. "You COULD have survived" not "WOULD have."
Eddmario: nope he never even played a vsh game untill he joined me a few days ago
lol
11,01We need to always do that.
Om: I can find you some explosives. :)
you are
milestones aren't set in stone simply because we're seeing who's on board with this
GilDash: Okay.
Bronystate is the best place to be watching Myth Busters.
More to the point, Hitler would have probably been deafened.
Dat expertise.
Shamroc: I played a VSH game WAAAAY before I joined you :P
1,11As far as I know, the Artist Spotlight and the Youtube Playlists are the first step towards BronyNation. Slowly intigrate them to be a norm for bronystate, along with the queue stremers.
FlareChaser|L4D2: LIES
if the team is good with it, then we're going to make them
pikorar: And how.
we have a skype group for BronyNation
pikorar: It is the best place to watch anything.
Oh Hai Bronystate
08,01shouldn't that in itself be a milestone/deadline, val?
they are looking at a male bag
that's where all the planning will be done
Hello ZombieBrony!
Allo ZombieBrony.
Shamroc: Seriously!
Hitler's voice tops at 200 decibals. I think his ears can stand an explosion...
hi
Hi ZombieBrony
Need 3 more for a VS match on L4D2 anyone wants to play ?
that's why it's on the team meeting topic
Hi Princess_Molestia! I love you!
hey ZombieBrony hows your day been
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-derpy-is-not-amused.png
come on guys
that's why I want everyone's thoughts now
2 SLOTS FOR L4D2
spam invite CeilingKirz :3
Argon gas
FlareChaser|L4D2: hes busy dude
Princess_Molestia are you ready yet
08,01fair enough, so long as it doesn't stagnate as a project
ppsssst: kirz, you want to join us
Shamroc: Ah, okay.
Oh, ok
Bigger guns makes everything funner... As long as the person with the gun doesn't want you dead.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: give me a minute.
psst. Nittany_Discord so do you
0,14for me, it depends on how closely the potential sites are integrated
...Spam invite shamroc. :3
Why must Kari Byron be married, whyyyy
FlareChaser|L4D2: i already said no
Derpy brought them letters!
Meanwhile okay
that's why I'm prodding us now, because Luna and I are sick of it not going anywhere
so many male
05@silver and in time the sections will be perfected. I think you and me have simillar ideas on how this "should" be
Randomnerd to ruin your dreams
think of it this way Saxy:
I like being surrounded by male... Mmmmm.
Alright, you said no im okay with that..
11,01Chrysalis: Wut?
alexxm: lol
anyone for L4D2? we have 2 slots open :3
BN is a hub site, which connects and links to all the participants of BN
0,14if everyone gets to do their own thing, but carry a common banner, I'm cool with that
I think
I think we should really get planning going. We have the idea, let's get the ball at least moving somewhat. Whoever wants to help with this should be in that group and help out with ideas and plans, etc. no?
want to join us for som l4d2
pikorar: oh myyyyyy
11,01I'm busy.
you know you want to
awwww
pikorar: I was wondering when someone would say that.
that's exactly what we intend slurry'
One slot open for L4D2, who wants in ?
I can get pretty frisky, can't I, MahBoi777?
lol
http://cheezburger.com/4919550976 http://cheezburger.com/6167031040 http://cheezburger.com/5169782528 http://cheezburger.com/6170583296
for science!
HHURRRG all the mods are busy!
MahBoi777: Oh, hello. ;)
Hello pikorar.
alright, are there any opposed to BN?
any concerns?
You knew that it was going to be either me or GilDash to say that, Om.
Man, these guys have one of the best jobs
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/311/691/8be.jpg I assume most of you'd like this.
11,01Cupcakes don't like your parties anymore. Make friends.
0,14I'm still wary of this
05i have mentioned my concerts and thoughts.
1,11Slurry: I repeat, that's what the Youtube Playlists and artist spotlight things are for.
*perks up* Did somebody say DOYLE?
Princess_Molestia are you ready yet
Mythbuster gon bust.
SO they can afford all that other shit BUT they can't get a new test dummy?
0,14from my personal experience, too much merging kills communities
hello GilDash, how are you?
nope, with enough planning, it should work. We need to get together and plan plan plan.
pikorar: I dind't know who. Its not like I keep track of your intrests. Nor do I care to
1,11Combine them with the queue streaming, and we have the beginings of BronyNation.
If bronystate goes down I'm going to be forced to actually do stuff with my life. :(
I know who you are.
so this explosion, is purely gratuitus boom
11,01BN is a good idea. We'll just need to prepare to hire more people down the line.
04First off, we're not even sure what Bronynation will become
only about 3 weeks til the video we've all been waiting for
pikorar: Same, but ill die before that.
0,14too much change, too many new people conflicting with the regulars, people leave
who am i Princess_Molestia
Ew ew ew
pikorar: i know.. sounds terrible:(
04We're not sure if it's going to be a hub site or a merging
I found the Lyra if anyone is interrested http://www.thedealersden.com/auction_details.php?auction_id=110031&parent_id=&option=agree_adult
I can tell you're just as frisky as us, Om. You just need a little time and love.
04We don't know
CINEMON CHALLENGE?
pikorar: EGAD
/me snuggles MahBoi777.
RustyMeat...dude drop the idea
oh god
Oh Princess_Molestia is here Im just gonna walk away.....*walks away*
No comment.
13too bad webrings were lame in the 1990s
MEDIC
oh dear
00,10Sure seems to be alot of outsidelinking going on.
It works idiot.
0,14if it's a hub site like Val's saying, where we're connected, but still functionally seperate, I can jive with that
RustyMeat, do not link that
Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I've done cinnamon without a problem. :)
XD
"A spoon full of cinemon makes the medicine go down" Damn fucking kids songs.
04But as for us, for BronyState's team, I've talked it over with a few TLs and we thought about possibly just passing along work to the team members for those that want to be involved in BronyNation but would rather work on it then just plan for it
:o
She needs an exorcist!
BN won't happen unless we make it happen. What is it? We dont' know. that's why we need to get everyone one board and figure out what it will become. it won't just pop out of thin air. If you don't like it now, that's because it isn't anything yet. You have a voice. You can fix problems. You can help it become something that will work for everyone.
lol
XD
fus ro dah!
Cinnimon challange? Try the Kool Aid challange.
dat exhale
CeilingKirz: you said ur up for the parade right?
Ow ow ow
XD
whats that Eddmario
You down 5 spoonfulls of pure kool aid powder
Bronysith: he said nope..
I can actually bypass my gag reflex... Heh, so many innuendos can come from me saying that.
GilDash: You must lack a gag reflexs
I've done that once. never again xDD
alright, so to conclude:
Shamroc: are you?
Om: Not really. I just focused.
04And like Slurry said, it really feels like there's a split and we're going to make decisions soon
O_O
Bronysith: i have no camra to
Oh god :S
Airpuff: Lol
we'll be adding the teamleaders and anyone who wants to participate with BN to the BN group
No. :3
Shamroc: okay then
XD
is there ANYONE opposed to this idea?
Eeeeeeeeeeeeew
that or you're a fucking psycho GilDash
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDDDD
GilDash: Sure sure.
MahBoi777: you ... just send out a cloud of .... yeah
04Unless they want to just work and not be involved in the group
eeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww
Sith, are you ready?
Litwick, Om: Nah. You just need to focus and chew like crazy.
im sure you could condition yourself to do it
0,14Put me down for opposed until there's a better semblance of a structure
11,01We just don't need to spread ourselves thing.
But why?!
Like a baws so far.
start off with a little
GilDash: You are still insane.
Needs to be about 20% something-er
04I must confess, this isn't something that can be just talked about, since there are members on the team that are still opposed
11,01*thin
Om: See Tori is doing fine too. :)
cmon lad!
When you want to bypass your gag reflex just don't think that you can't swallow it. Don't turn that into an innuendo... Or if you do don't voice it against me.
00,10like a baws
^
GilDash: And yet, you are still insane
04How would you address that, Val?
HE DID IT.
1,11May I say something about this?
Sumica: LIKE A BOSS
bawsliek
pikorar: Hey, I've got great experience with my gag reflex. ;)
YYYEEAAAAAHH
Saxy: would you be opposed to joining the group so that you can help form what structure you wish?
ima try it
O_o
Om: I never said anything about that. :D
/me gives GilDash a spoon of Cinamon
as for spreading ourselves too thin
Is this the cinnamon challenge????????????
He starts coughing up blood
this is why we're joining with other sites
LIKE A BAWS
Bronystate is Bronystate
Grow a mustache. It will make you badass at the cinnamon challenge.
GilDash: Wont change my opinions
I meant beard.
BronyNation is something else
/me eats Airpuff's spoonful of cinnamon.
hello?
Grow a beard.
That's why we need discussions, Saxy. If some of us come up with an idea you don't like, you can help fix it to where it will work. If you're opposed, I implore you to join the group and help out.
regardless of what happens to BronyNation
how come something so simple is so dangerous
GilDash: 6_9
hello CCCP
GilDash: drunk gagging? :D
Hi CCCP! Love you!
we are still bronystate
/me hugs CCCP
GilDash?
hey CCCP hows your day been
Hey hey hey CCCP :)
hi MahBoi777

Hey everone! :)

Princess_Molestia: Your higness. ;)
hi Ponies47 and DerpSurge
Airpuff: Nah, I'm good. :)
Dat sex god
it absorbs water. First your free saliva, then it goes after the fluids inside the cells of your cheeks and gums.
alexxm: It's been fine
lol
One time, I was on a plane, and I still had connection to this website. I was like. :O :) :O :)
alexxm: its been good, you?
;)
GilDash: ... hax! xD
Because alexxm, cinnamon is like an allergen when you take a full spoonfull. Your body just treats it like a toxin or a poison.
there's still no clear line of whether bronystate will continue as it is, or whether it will merge into the bronynation site, or grow into the bronynation site
04Silver?
0,14my biggest concern is that we don't lose our audience for the sake of chasing of what might be a pipe dream (I think that's the right term)
Dat Totally random team
0,14I'm happy with being our own niche
pikorar: Not if you handle it right. ;)
04Well, with what Saxy is saying
as I said, Bronystate stays the same
>.>
XD
04It seems most of the newer members are against while the older members are for
Can i post a video during the commercial?
00,10a part of the whole
nothing changes to Bronystate when we affiliate with BN
He likes guro :D
boom!
BOOM
04We don't know that, Val
04We don't know how BN is gonna work out
See *affiliate* I don't think BS is going anywhere.
04The only thing we've really done is just discuss the possibility of "what could be"
11,01Seems BN needs more planning.
i'm good CCP
11,01A lot more.
yes
yes
05SaxyPretender: good. cause since BS inst compromised by BN, that shouldnt be a problem
exactly
05isnt*
Hi CCCP
lol i was reading the lyra lushie comments on know ur meme and found this http://www.pajamasandcoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/what_the_fuck_is_this_shit_dr_seus.jpg
Ty, we've ALWAYS said that BS would be its own thing
You know I've bern thinking this over and I think I'm gonna give up trying to make my bro a brony. He has listened to 3 episodes, Winter Wrap Up, and Smile Smile Smile, He didn't like it :'( (Or did he)
Hey CCCP
04And this is why things have stagnated, because others on the team are against and I'd like everyone to move forward with us
that's why we need everyone to help out and make it work
Ow.
Next time on mythbusters: Are atomic bombs as fun to blow up as the media says? *Atomic exlposion*... Yes. Yes they are.
05,15Yeah if BN doesn't affect BS then I'm perfectly fine with it
never once have we even remotely discussed the possibility of evolving it like that
What season is this?
Ow ow ow.
04But that's not what we talked about with the others for BN
Adam is getting hurt all the time xD
12!pokemon
04I was there for the opening discussion
MysticLugia, you are a 10Luxio.
oooooooowwwwwwww
XD
Ponies47: just denial lol
12!eonget
dude
04There were talks of what of; a hub site? Merging?
1,11Brony Nation is, in the end, us being a showcase for the rest of the hard working Brony community. We show off the talents of people who have much to offer and give them a place where they can become known and come into the spotlight. People who view BronyNation learn of what artists, musicians, video makers and whatnot that they like and branch off to them. And since we are so open
1,11and friendly with what we promote, there is no discrimination or favoritism to push the community away from using BronyNation.
hi Randomnerd
XD
then you and I must have been in two completely different conversations
!blame
/me blames Skylands.
Look at these people, amazing how sheep'll show up for the slaughter.
*snap* *Booooooooooooooom*
hey Randomnerd
With adam's hairstyles throughout the years he was always asking for pain.
i'm good CCCP my dads girlfriend said she might watch an episode of mlp
Ohai MahBoi777
I like pleasure...
04Nothing was set in stone for how BronyNation would be represented
No one condemning, you lined up like lemmings, you lead to the water.
Mmmm, veiwing pleasure.
O_o
alexxm: thats great! :D :D
alexxm: awesome
alexxm you are assimilating your entire family at this rate
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS-KVpZ9mrQ
Hah! Om! I knew you could get frisky.
11,01I'm not for or against BN. It just needs planning because it appears that there isn't any. It's just an idea.
I wonder if there was a MLP question in that mail bag...
Dead Space
Wait.... This is live TV?
pikorar: No comment.

Ran, you are a 7Phione.

Listen to me
MahBoi777: I thought Smile Smile Smile was gonna get him. Well he really didn't listen to it. Maybe I should make him listen to it agian.
2<3
oh my
BN will happen
Nothing is set in stone. So far we have, what? a name? a vague idea? We need everyone to get together and help discuss, change, manage, etc. It's so important
!pokemon
with or without us
Isn't Prometheus part of the Alien seies?
^^
*series
either we hop on the bandwagon now
MMmm... Frisky Om.
whee playing Kirby music live!
the problem how I see it is, there has been very little planning for BN because nobody will move forward unless everyone is on board, but everyone's not going to come aboard unless they see that there is some sort of plan
Om: I've got some viewing pleasure for you right here. ;)
04Luna's right
Eddmario i think so
Eddmario: Sort of?
04Either you're for this or you're not
1,11WHAT FUCKING PART OF "YOUTUBE PLAYLIST AND ARTIST SPOTLIGHT ARN'T YOU FUCKING GETTING?
the minute I saw the Prometheus trailer I lost my hope of it being a a decent movie.
Ponies47: Lesson Zero and Party of one alwasy helps lol
I'm back! :)
dang typo
1,11I've said it at least three times.
how come Alchemist
Am I the only one who wants to see Battleship?
05,15Wait, you guys have seen That Guy with the Glasses right? They all have their own sites, but they all are tied under the That Guy banner.
hello Gamer_Luna
11,01I'm fine with BN then.
Welcome back Gamer_Luna
11,01I'm not against it.
e_e I belive a retreat is in order.
yes
I would pay to see it, GilDash! Just write on this check how many millions of dollars you want.
hey Gamer_Luna hows your day been
05so who is against and why?
05so far i havent seen anyone
Om: run run run lol
o.o
hi Gamer_Luna
nice ecco!
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 6Geodude.

.....................................
11,01Shizuka was during the last meeting.
Gamer_Luna: Holla! :)
You know what's weird?
11,01That's the only person I know.
05why?
alexxm: I havent seen it yet, so it might still redeem itself, but im skeptical
13i'll go with it if we have a plan
alexxm: I just woke up :$
same
1,11Thank you, Fluttercry
pikorar: I don't need any. I'll give you a private show. ;)
Alchemist you only saw a minute out of what at least 90 minutes give it a chance
11,01A plan and good communication.
11,02Please watch your tone SirSilverscreen
MahBoi777: Those where 2 of the episodes he listened to. He really didn't WATCH them he just LISTEND. And he said that counts as watching. I think I'm gonna need some tape. :3
We call pure elemental iron steel, but we call iron alloys iron... WTF SCIENCE!?
04We need to know what BronyNation is primarily for, and I hope we're not forgetting: It's a way to give things back to the fan...to make it a place where the fan is the most important aspect of the site
SCIENCE
05ok so if people got together, and worked up a bit more defined outline to what BN is
pikorar: I don't get it....
08,01i'm for it, but i think that as it stands, it's a load of hot air with no plan of action. the ball need to start rolling.
0,14if it's a hub site/overall banner, then I'd be okay with it
05and then presented it
Hunh?
13but there has to be some kind of plan or else we're throwing effort at something that might not amount to anything
Hi Acleps! I love you!
05we can have anotehr revision?
elemental iron is iron.
04So all of us coming together for BronyNation is to make it for the fan, to give the fandom back to the fan primarily
But I'll explain, Acleps.
steel is an alloy
/me hugs pikorar
04So with that said
13yeah a hub with banner could work, like a "part of the BronyNation network" kind of thing
honestly that's how I always envisioned it
04It looks like we're gonna be doing another meeting with the rest of the people involved with BronyNation
Acleps: Holla! :)
Oh, no... Deadliest Catch is back.
05did no one hear me?
04It could very well be a hub...who knows
/me hugs Acleps.
people need to learn science before using sciency terms :)
So,what are we watching? :)
GilDash: Hey! :)
/me misses Gamer_Luna :'(
Bye everypony
experts
yeah wrek, I think that's a good idea
hey Acleps what have you been up to
Gamer_Luna: Mythbusters
05,15Exactly like I said TGWTG is a good model for that.
Gamer_Luna: Mythbustahs
04That's what the discussion with the other sites involved with BronyNation would be for
/me 11,01applies water to RyunosukeKnT
04To discuss the next step
the admins and TL's will meet with people involved with BN
Irish_Pony Gamer_Lunas back
Oh wait... Gamer_Luna is here?!
alexxm: Nothing special...
we'll draw something out
and then present it to you all
Cinnimon breathing dragon!
is that good?
yesh
Irish_Pony: Irish! :)
/me 07,01is getting all the pings
0,14good enough for me
05it will give those that are agaisnt sometihng to work with
04I'm fine and dandy with that, it seems that's our next step anyways
hey Luna hows your day been
/me 11,01likes normal Luna
ohai Luna
I think we're asking the wrong question. Rather, why are we even asking a question? It's not "Who is opposed and why?" It should be "Further discussion is needed. Please help plan, get the ball rolling, and get the idea cemented. Currently we have nothing, so no one can say they are opposed or not. We just need a way of thinking this through.'
/me randomly pings Luna
Luna: Ping :P
lol
suddenly beard
When iron is refined and all of the impurities are removed we call it steel, but it's really pure elemental iron. But when you have an iron alloy, with all the impurities still in it, you call it iron... How does that make sense?
hi Luna
/me hugs Luna and brushes her mane
Yes, what is it?
You all better not mention what i was like this morning to Gamer_Luna or i swear to god....
04That's what the talk will be for, Slurry
okay, so then we're agreed
11,01Good thought.
/me 2rolls Nick down a hill
11,01I'm for it.
good, now we can move on
pikorar: So steel = Pure Fe?
/me pets ran
1,11"Please help plan, get the ball rolling, and get the idea cemented."
2:3
lol
steel is an alloy
Yes, Acleps. And iron = Fe alloy.
alright, resource management
Fe + C + a few other things
pikorar: there is no such thing as 100% pure. Steel still contains carbon.
We've graced this topic already, but I'd like to reiterate. If you're feeling as if your talents aren't being utilized. Speak up. Communication, blah blah blah. If you guys aren't willing to speak up, we'll never run efficiently.
Acleps: No... pikorar is being silly...
pikorar: becasue iron was there first. and when we learned to make a by far more pure form, we needed another word to differ it from the cheaper iron
but... Gamer_Luna <3
GilDash: Science is not silly!
1,11Am I just being ignored? WE have a plan to start it, we have an idea, and we know how to execute it for the time being until the next meeting.
pikorar; GilDash: I don't know what to believe now... :S
05that made no sense. are you asking us to present out talents?
/me 07,01murrs softly
Woooooooooooooooooona
I know, Dark_Horst, but they should just realize that it's an iron alloy.
Science is science
no
04Because we can't just jump forward, Silver
Om: I didn't say it was. I said pikorar was.
/me hugs Luna
we're asking you to tell us if you feel you aren't beind used properly
science is everything*
Irish_Pony: <3 I missed you :)
04If we don't look where we're going we're going to hit a wall
GilDash: Oh, thats fine then.
By that logic its silly to call roasted bread a toast and not bread...
Gamer_Luna: I missed you <3
and now... i'm finally back!
TOAST
since people may not want to come forward this publicly
my little mythbusters: explosins are magic
I'll leave it at this:
all toasters toast toast
alexxm: :D
1,11I'm not saying we jump forward, I'm saying that we already have an idea to start with and that we already have a place to start a discussion on how to move forward.
The admins are in charge of organizing everything. If you don't like how the organization is going, TELL US
CCCP: O U
and we'll do something about it
:33
okay, good, moving on
I wonder when the next chapter of "Myth Buckers" will come out...
1,11We have a stepping stone to start with.
/me nuzzles Magical_pablez94
poof o.o
we already worked on BN.. BS was a roadmap to eventually BN
Terms of Service. Yes or No? If we're okay with this idea, then we'll go forward with it. I'll assemble a group and whatnot. Any concerns about it?
Kisses Irish_Pony so,how was your morning? :)
Eddmario: me too
acetylene
JESUS
Gamer_Luna: I dare not say...:S
Hotter than giant robots.
I actually would like to see some responses on resource management
05what would our ToS contain and what would its purpose be?
Le confirmation.
00,10we are seting up a ToS?
0,5^?
Irish_Pony: Hey, you found another thing. Good job.
Irish_Pony: Telll me,please? :(
/me tackles someone random
explanation of what BS is, and that they agree that we aren't responsible for them being too young to see what we stream
