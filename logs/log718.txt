The ultimate silence when 2 people leave
11,02Though, it does sound interesting, not sure what the BronyCon documentary thing is about though.
I'm a Canadian and I feel empty without my hockey :(
I think it's mainly about people's perspective of the show and the fandom from the inside. The fans themselves (I think)
.-.
I'm a Swede and I feel empty without my life
:<
/me licks AJIsAwesome becuase he has nothing else to do

You can't see a single freaking bit of his wall.
It's all posters.
00,10walls are over raited
i would dig his basement room
00,10wonder if we can get him to do a pony cover
We could try. :)
uh hes on the top floor
idc :I
Of which song, though?
00,10would it matter
Good point.
00,10and this guys likes to do medlies
All the songs? :3
ALL OF THEM
00,10fave one here
we free to suggest videos?
OMG
is that some wall?
METROID
Dancing sumi pony goes with everything.
^
oh wait dresser
00,10his laptop blends in with the wall
What is this wall thing you speak of?
I see no wall. Only posters
Metroid <3
a wall of posters?
>:3
00,10funny thing is the poasters chage like with every video
Wow
00,10not so much now cause he puts videos out more frequently
00,10but like once a month before
00,10see if I can find an older one
Dat boss theme

What. Why not?
^
00,10I dont have ops

What did you want requested? Music? Videos?
00,10who ever set up the chat never set the flags

Just music?
00,10request what you want to see.

I don't suppose this guy has a cover of "into the Wilderness", the Wild Arms OP?
Ah, Perfect Dark
are we doing requests now?
Never played that one
yep
AAAAAAAAWSHIIIIIIIIIT
Hard finding something everyone's not already seen yet.
Kirby :D
Kirby 64 is actually overrated and is only good because of nostalgia
00,10yeah taking PM'ed request.
only good thing in it was combining powers, that's it
00,10Mind you I still hold the right to refuse to play
As always.
I won't /try/ to send you crap.
So what is the best Kirby game to you, Crimson? :)
AWW YEAH DONKEY KONG 64
00,10as you can see much older posters
I honestly couldn't get into DK64.
I can understand why people liked it, but it just didn't really appeal to me.
I liked the game with the bongos.
Because I get to hit bongos.
I love Banjo Kazzooie, but I've never been able to keep my interest in it all the way through the game
THIS GAME
i got up to the boss when i was younger in banjo kazooie, could never beat it
00,10funny thing is I have probably compleated more games now that I stream them then I had as a kid growing up
WHERE IS THIS FROM.....
DIDDY KONG RACING
OH GAWD
Conker's Bad Fur Day! LOL XD
AJIsAwesome: I agree there's way too many collectibles, but I liked the bosses (that weren't recycled from and earlier level :D )

It WILL zap you however if you touch two wires at once
Dat Drifting
Cypresswolf: or touch more than one wire
^
did you know: 1000 volts are roughly enough for 1 cm lightning
no AJIsAwesome it's XTREME. You have to drop off the first vowel because it couldn't keep up.
Mutterguy: :D
Don't cross the streams

Flyboy: Zelda didn't exist yet when this came out. :D
^
VIDEO GAMES didn't exist yet when this came out. :D
Gold_Demona: BUGS BUNNY! YOUR ARGUMENT IS NOW INVALID
video games date back as far as 1958
OW!

00,10zelda did't
Flyboy: Oh yeah, you're right. o_o
suddenly normal bugs
What's up doc? What? No, wrong number!
infernap12: Not video games as we know it
thats true
Dat Red
silly bugs bunny, promoting pornography
and no BBC television service either
actually wikipedia says 1940s
like i said cartoons weren't made for kids
Yup
00,10love this bit
not originaly anyway
That's why Bugs was able to get away with crossdressing all the time
Kinda wish they still had that feel to them
damn the chat froze atop the stream
Oh yeah this part hahaha
dat chopsticks
hewl yeah!
just regular slapstick
This song
This brings me back, I had a long special for Bugs' 25 years on VHS and it was one of the first things I saw as a kid
Animation, at this time, was made for everyone... the idea was to have a short that would "buffer" the two main features. (Almost evry evening in most movie palaces was a double feature, unless it was a "intended" huge blockbuster.)
Look ma, no hands!
MadSurge: Was it the Bugs Bunyn Road Runner Movie?
Sumica hey mind showing the who framed roger rabbit scene with this song?
Gold_Demona: no, it was a clip show with tons of his cartoons
00,10not sure if it's on you tube.
Sumica I believe it is
MadSurge: That's what the Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie was. :D
Sumica Yep found it.
Oh Bugs, you so silly :3
^
Gold_Demona: yes, but I bet there was no Mel Blanc in it
ever seen the death waltz in synthesia
MadSurge: Yeah there was
Gold_Demona: I mean, real life Mel Blanc
wb AJIsAmesome!

Great idea. Put the two ducks with the speach impediments together. :D
Oh Daffy :D
Ponies47: that's alot ._.

Gold_Demona: also, no real cohesion to the clips, just bits from all his cartoons
lol
BroHoof: I had 6 crates to unbox
MadSurge: I see
I seriously hope they do someone like this again soon. :D
*something
Ponies47: damn

I am so reminded of George Carlin at this toon. He said, that there were only two types of motorists-- Morons and Manicas. As in...
I feel like Walker whenever I try to cross the street. The button I hit to trigger the walk signal takes a long time and tends to go off when cars are already in my way and wears off before the path is safe.

WUT
8 days!

yes h#he was :P
..he*
/me lurks in the shadows of chat

You are not helping that you're married
I actually never knew that she was married. :D
dear Spell-of-Gaming spiderman.mp4
/me grabs snow and pulls him towards the light (I'll regret this won't I)
"Or ping pong, skiing, reading, flossing, fishing, curling, walking, sleeping, singing...RT @tarastrong: I have perfect boobs for voice over." - YakkoPinky via twitter is probbably the best reply :p

woo
snow, because why not?
Gangnam Style has been annoying as fuck that I'll imagine in 5 years, Roblox still uses it
better than beiber :)
Gangnam Style was okay the first 2 times, but now it's annoying.
oh beiber, he gets so much hate, i dont ;ike the guy but i dont think he deserves half the shit he gets
It's his fault that his fans are rabid as fuck
lol
CreativePonyName I know (but I do really dislike his music its awful in my opinion)
I mean, Jesus, his fans tried to lick his VOMIT
............
if he would just stop writing cheesy love songs im sure he would do better
and..WTD did they actually do that?
CreativePonyName: Yes.
does he write it?
i dont know actually...
probably not
TO GOOGLE
He doesn't write his own songs.
Duh.
internet dosent let me go on google but lets me on here :)
If he did write his own songs, his voice would fit the song
^
"He co-wrote 3 out of the 8 songs off of My World ("Bigger", "Down To Earth", "First Dance"), wrote the bonus track "Common Denominator" by himself, and co-wrote all of the songs on My World 2.0."
Sup
suppudy sup
:D
Bolt sup is a form of paddle boarding! jk how are you?
the thing I have against bieber isnt his songs per se, its just not my style. It's the fact that he got noticed via youtube, all the while when the major labels are abusing the DMCA takedowns to remove videos ... from youtube. just seems hypocritical and greedy to me.
Really pot
I would listen to Friday all day than listen to Bieber.
Paddle Boarding! WOOHOO
Also, that PewDiePie video mocking Bieber was hilarious
Bieber sucks
Bolt yay the slowest and booringest form of boarding
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2KUICQDsQ0&feature=relmfu holy shiz this sounds amazing
xD
Rebecca Black > Bieber > Gangnam Style
booringest isnt a work :(
ikr :$
cba to find another word
Spell-of-Gaming and living tombstone trumps all of them together?
Depends.
Have you seen this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqEDIFfy4Yg
yep

THat's OLD news, Bolt. :D

Good morning everyone :)
id never heard of this before...i am intrigued
Great shows require attention. Attention is a lack of distraction and concentrated focus. To focus, I must remove all distractions. My tummy is rumblling. (TL;DR Snack run, BRB)
hey MLP_Brovakiin !

how are things MLP_Brovakiin
good thanks alexxm, you?

twilight_sprinkle: so? he's still the best and the best ever so far
Eli: yeah, but itd be nice to see him win more and more :D
Eli: he should be staying in Switzerland for a while, so if you see him, you know what to do :D
Good morning everypony.

Eli: hm i'll think about it, although i suspect he'd probably prefer to just give an autograph
Ah cereal and this show , nice combo
What are we watching?
I am cooking pancakes, Jaymoo
twilight_sprinkle: i guess... the chances that i run into him aren't even that small if you think about it: i live 20km from him and one of my best friends has a vacation house in the same region he usually stays... i could stalk him :P
AttackWithHugs: Makes my cereal pale in comparison now :|
Pancakes~
Can I has some D:
Only the worthy may have pancakes.
oni_link, and I'm making them from scratch <3
So yeah, help yourself.
Eli: well yeah, you said that a few weeks ago :P but i dont how much good that would do, dunno how often he goes out anyway lol
That change of heart.

Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 7 days, 23 hours, 51 minutes, 53 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
One week.
one weeek! :3
yay! :3
:)
I messed up, darn thumb
one week
/me dances to the music
* .
3 days til german s2
and then bronystate experienced technical difficulties on premiere day
nuuuu
as always?
oni_link: What's irritating is this has been going on for a while now.
Jake: ohhh right. i should watch out for that
So what show is this?
I was hoping to get out this semester, but no, there's more red tape to cut through :[
twilight_sprinkle, shut up it won't happen. Everything will go as planned.
ill be off for a bit again
Everlasting_Joy: oh bummer. Why do you have to take up another year?
see ya when you get back Jake
Bye Jake
AttackWithHugs: okay.jpg
bye Jake
I love that song
timewrap
lol
Timewarp?
see ya Jake
yup
oni_link: I have to satisfy the bloody university's requirements. If you aren't in college yet, you'll find out soon enough.
/me sulks off to a corner ignored. and dispising the murdering of rocky horror picture show.
bye Jake !
08,01CrystalineShard: Spaced
That's a pretty violent shake.
Flashback...
Everlasting_Joy: Oh yeah prerequisites and all that huh?
lol still had a tash as a kid
the kid had a mustache xD
So is this show suppost to be funny or what?
suddenly discribing this show XD.
join us
oni_link: Sort of, see, I'll have all the classes I need for my major after this semester. The college's requirement says I have to take other classes unrelated to my major just because they are at a certain level (higher level courses). In other words, after this semester, I'm just wasting time and money satisfying some stupid requiset of theirs.
08,01dat close encounters
08,01hey Unnr!
Everlasting_Joy: Well that sucks
Everlasting_Joy: general education stff?
*stuff
prolly missing the joke guess
/me shrug
oni_link: Yep... I'll shut up now.

twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, the short version is yes.
08,01more nerdy humour
I'm canaidian :/

Oh look, a Dexter's Lab scene.
08,01the base case is Thanksgiving.
This has nothing on dexter's lab.
but canadian thanksgiving is a month earlier
oni_link: So, what's bothering you?
"scrambling the your DNA" nice Tagline
lol wow hentai tentacle monster
Everlasting_Joy: Nothing really except for getting fed up with my country's medical system. Pointless paperwork and waiting for approval
Hentai Tentacle Monster? They really went for that Joke >.<
waiiit
what is this?
oni_link: What's wrong, in the sense of your health, if I may ask.
is..this like a doctor who rippoff?
no one got the referance?
/me is sad
CreativePumkinName: you realize doctor who isnt even the first thing with time travel?
They think like heavy weapons guy
Everlasting_Joy: Got a bum knee. Went out months ago and it was getting better until a couple of weeks ago when it gave out on me as I left work to go home
why is it always a doctor who ripoff, as if its the first thing about time travel
CrystalineShard: were you trying to make a superhuman samurai syber-squad joke?
twilight_sprinkle: because it's the first thing that comes to mind.
will this Banana Peel be Chakovs Gun?
Unnr: get's a cookie.
CrystalineShard: only because people nowadays dont read enough classic sci-fi literature..
ohei Unnr
oni_link: :(, leg injuries suck.
twilight_sprinkle: like the time machine.
CrystalineShard: exactly
Oi DoshWithReenbows
hai Lil_B
o/
Cylops?
Everlasting_Joy: yeah, in the very least im still walking but still. in all the time it takes to get me checked out, it does more harm than help.
DashWithRainbows
xbox
oni_link: How long have you been waiting for and how long do you have left to wait for?
Everlasting_Joy: Well I just got my medi-cal which is worthless because I still have to pay for everything. And now theres another program I have to apply for but I have to cancel my current coverage to get it and I dont know how long that will take.
Wait
Jolly Fats and Wehawkin?
O_O
lol
08,01heh
oni_link: Jeez, it sounds like more red tape than I am going through :(.
Everlasting_Joy: I guess, Im just gonna have to bite the bullet and hold out until they give me the greenlight :|
Practicle problems
XD
oni_link: Still, doesn't mean it isn't a terrible situation.
Everlasting_Joy: Oh yeah, theres no doubt about that. Im just not going to complain as much.
so this is MIB
:/
ha
this seems more lik-yeah, what CrystalineShard said
oni_link: Good attitude.
"That's 2 dollars."
Everlasting_Joy: part of growing up i guess. i learned that bickering solves nothing. :P
oni_link: Doesn't mean venting isn't healthy.
But ya gotta know the territory
What I meant to say is, venting can be a good thing.
Everlasting_Joy: Oh yeah I have outlets for that though. I sit down and listen to music, work on making my own or play some shooting games hehe
oni_link: :).
lul such irony
ermahgerd that art
I used to vent in fighting games till they started making me more fustrated.
CrystalineShard: Oh that was me when I was like 14.
gewt amped one of the worst examples
getamped*
uhhh
I use shooters as a vent. The excessive anger blocks out the other anger I have.
re
Everlasting_Joy: TF2 works wonders for me :)

oh
Stallion_of_War: yes

Why do people assume Slenderman wants to hurt you? Maybe you just dropped your wallet, and he's shy because he has no face.
I'm forming the Equal Rights for Slenderman group
08,01Stallion_of_War: he just wants $20
Stallion_of_War, the ERS?
I'm trying to work an A between the e and the r, but yes
bye bye everypony i have to go away for some time
Bye Maid_RainBow1
bye Maid_RainBow1
Equal Active Rights for Slenderman - EARS
He should appreciate that, given he has none.
EARS for Slenderman
little redundant, but EARS is the group name so....
why not eyes surely they would be more usefull for the slenderman. the poor blind man

hiyah razorwing1269
Have you ever restored a computer using a system image on multiple dvds?
Maybe someone should start a brony clinic?
how are you today razorwing1269 ?
im great
no, I didn't try it, I wasn't even able to make those cd's because it always printed some error
hey i can post here my youtube chanel
what have you been up to razorwing1269
thats dandy
damn
I'm trying to restore an old image back to my laptop but the damn thing cant see it
i was editing my new pmv
hello bronystate
What are you doing up so late d3rb
Hey d3rb
just woke up jmo
and it is image of the Windows only, or does it contain some other data? and what did you use to make the backup?
at 4:51AM bro?
went to bed really early
Righto. Understandable.
how've you been d3rb
its supposed to be the entire hard drive
whath time is
I just used the windows backup in the OS itself
unless that just backs up files?
meeh...good enough i guess alexxm
you?
hey i can post my youtube chanel?
I don't know, I tried using some build in packardbell backup tool
if there are some important data on the backup, I think there should be way to get them out
no there is no important data
as long as no one is streaming i guess so
What I wanted to do was put the factory system image that I made back to the laptop to see how many GB it would take
Oh hi again alexxm
then get a new/used hard drive that at least has that much GB
so that can help me in costs
how are things Safari|foal
ok here it is http://www.youtube.com/user/RazorWing1269?feature=mhee
But if its too much work, I might just go with another computer
Still completely awesome alexxm. :P
yeah
Any change on your end alexxm?
nope
There was somone else I planned on asking, hes a manager of an IT univeristy
:)
manager of the IT department of a university I mean
yup
Hi Dken2021
allo
hi Dken2021 and alexxm
razorwing1269 Actually you would have to ask a mod for self advertisement

how did that even happen

No one tried to log in as me today...
yay
how can you tell?
Well. I have a brony problem guys. I am hopelessly and utterly addicted to pony. Not only am I accidently saying "Buck" to cuss, but I just read "Alcorn" as "Alicorn" =|
Should I seek help?
if you're registered, when you log in it will tell you the number of failed attempts to log in
>_>
I can't tell if you're being serious or not Barb.
What NullRadix said.
I think you're fine Barb
Being totally serious.
Okay. If I got to get any tattoos, and I tell you guys about it. STop me
Barb|WHAT it's normal, you just have to get used to that like the rest of us.
Jmo I am depending on you. DO NOT LET ME GET TATTOOO
I can trust you right? Riiiiggghtt.
Barb|WHAT, dont get a tatto
Ew tattoo.
tatoo**
Why would you get one in the first place, jeez.
^
The temptation?
depends entirely on your reason for getting the tattoo
I'd would hold it on the tattoo, that's like super commitment, and you'll probably regret it sometime later
Jmo I don't care for them, but I can get really drunk someimtes
I tend to wake up in strange beds.
Ew drinking.
With strange people.
Why would you drink in the first place, jeez.
NewDCD: neither roundabout nor lights? Or are the lights just hard to see?
Dejavu.
Hiya
I drink water like everyone else! I can't help it if people put roophies in my drinks.
I am just that sexy.
ello RainbowAsh
People will go to great lengths.
Hi Dken2021
I'm not a tattoo person, but as I understand it tattoos are there to help define you. If you feel strongly enough that pony has had a large effect on your life, it's not crazy
I drink only water and fizzy drinks :D
hey RainbowAsh
09,01don't really remember
09,01I just know people here drive like CRAZY
Hi d3rb

Its just a joke Jmo
THIS IS SRS BSNS.
Don't take my crap seriously
GFDI.
Barb|WHAT: if you're that concerned, never drink anything that wasn't sealed when you got to it, or has been out of your sight
going to repartition my disk soon
Browniestate is a place of cereal bsns.
NewDCD: and traffic tickets aren't enough to scare them off?
Y BARB.
bornystate is srs bsns >=(
NullRadix: I don't think you understand. They go to GREAT LENGTHS
MadSurge: when everyone is driving like crazy, they can't catch everyone
And that was going to get really wrong.
Gona stop now.
My brain, and the places it goes.

Im not that riled up about it. But of course Im curious about it.

Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 7 days, 19 hours, 55 minutes, 8 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
Thunder, my body is in a state of constant readiness
Not as excited as tom
That guy hast it down to the SECOND
what does !cd do anyway?
Also I find myself pretty hyped about the comic, too
meh, im mildly excited
My excitement has gone through the roof, and come full circle
I am "meh" about the whole experience.
Liek if you cry evertim http://dl.dropbox.com/u/76295879/130922035969.jpg
Maybe the fallout between seasons does this.
being meh about it adds buffer in case it sucks. if its good it will be a pleasant suprise
I'm in another hotel now
Hi pony_3290, what happened to the last one?
RainbowAsh: since my house lost power, my dad is ordering hotel rooms
I choose you: Intern! Quick Intern! Do "Free Labor" !
Yes!
d3rb: so your philosophy is the well known "have low expectations that way you wont be disappointed"?
Its... Its...
Not very effective.
pony_3290, ouch, I see. Sandy got you?
Fawk
yes
3 hours to go also howdy all im gonna get dizzy looking at that snake
pretty much Alchemist. Also i just dont get excited about much anymore
I always have high expectations so I'm always disappointed
it happens
I expect it to be awful (its a win win situation)
d3rb: I was thinking about having some changes in my life too for the same reason. Too bad you need money for everything, so Im stuck :D
pull the lever cronk *clunk* WRONG LEVAAAA
Alchemist, i cant relate to a lack of money
anyoone who kows what thats from is awesome

RainbowAsh: its the right way of thinking imo if you can sustain it. I got tired of getting disappointed all the time so I followed the way d3rb|AFK does.
i went for a walk couple minutes ago and looked at stars
DaringDerpy, nah close, australia. i mean its already mostly up

Alchemist, there was a time when I was thinking like that, too. In the end I found that it was far harder.

Its friday and I want the work day to be over already.
FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU
build your own flying car...I would buy one or ten :)
Delorian?

Yes. I am weird. No. It will not stop.
I don't think you would want it to anyways.
there is a pic I wanted to share but for the life of me cant decide if its nsfw or not.
It clears the sinuses anyways, so I do you a favor.
lolwut alcamast
When in doubt, NSFW
MadSurge oh! Dawwww
Barb|TapedOnKickMe: its not the concept.
Alchemist, PM me the picture if you want
Alchemist: Let me have a peek, maybe I can help you judge
lol
lolol all those demands
They want your smut man
Give them the smut
As in, I could be of help
Nope. You want smut
You dirty dirty pony you.
Barb|TapedOnKickMe, how dare you question my altruism! Harumpf
Question everything.
ESPECIALLY EA GAMES
the original was nsfw and it got reworked to remove the nsfw part but im not sure if it was enough
ERMAGERD U GTA SHOW ME

hi Colt_Brovakiin !
:) i mmissed brony state good thing i made it for movie night
Hello Lil_B :)
this is the best ponification of Dalí so far imo http://derpy.me/aYdne
dat octavia doesn't look healthy
The Persistence of Mare-mories? :P
Polydunami: I dont think its a ponification of a specific painting, its just the motives. but great pun :D
hey Thunder_Crescent
howdy DKen2021
If there was an erotic version of that painting, Alchemist, it would probably be called "The Persistence of Mammaries" :3
hey hye
*hey
Oh hey, Paspie
erotics? paintings? if? what's going on?
ello Paspie
no stream it seems
hai Dken2021 and Paspie ^^
Polydunami: does this count? http://derpy.me/dvKMS
Is that Dali?
its got boobs and is a Dalí painting
Oh, so what's it called?
Oh, I see
crazy pic
No no no. Its Nudity: Y U NO CLOTHING?
The movie.
I'd probably say NSFW, but it's a Dali painting :|
<_<
>_>
^_^
Hello Everyone
ello
Heyas
Hey there, Rainbowlicious
hai Rainbowlicious and Aponymouss
And hey there, Aponymouss
Polydunami: holy f*ck! guess what I've found! I love the internet :D http://derpy.me/2ymE9
lolwut
xD
That is awesome
dat fluttershy-RD :D
Temptation of Spike
By the way, that Rainbow Dash is kind of... strange
/me doesn't notice Applejack's super-long hind legs :P
too long mane and tail maybe?
Oh yeah, they're in Poison Joke -_(\
yep :)
its genius
I did not see the joke at first :S
wish I had this kind of creativity
A burly russian man walks into bar. He leaves with sanvich.
Funny yes?
wasn't there an artist somewhen that used to shit on his pictures after painting?
return to chat, see this ^ what do
hi d3rb
Invi: I havent heard about it but I wouldnt be suprised if there was such an artist :D
hey Invi
hey guys
d3rb ignore it, it never happened >_>
done
http://www.terrariaonline.com/attachments/shitjustgotreal-jpg.5874/ xD
I know there was one who only took photos of people's anuses... and i mean close up HD.
why?
did he want to steal peoples soul?
because art
Hey
Invi: because art and http://derpy.me/Nonqt
I tried to google for anus art photography. bad move :D
._.
:D
i wanted to find the guy who did it before you jump to conclusions
why would you google such a thing...
I went in to have my professor sign a form for me and he roped me into debugging with him for like 2 hours
-.-
Gentlemen. It is almost time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQXQrPdwego
Invi+1
+1 to what?
:/
hope he was satisfied
Your question
found a pic of his/her gallery, but no names. and pic is definitely NSFW :D
O_o
People are weird.
He sent me a message like 5 minutes after I left saying he fixed it
yes we are
yup
Erm, how do i see the screen? nothing is there.
because no one's using it atm
Aponymouss: there is no stream, its supposed to be black.
the snake from the snake game ate the stream and now chases itself
Oh ok
I have 1:26 minutes on my brony CD left. what song should I add?
Figured out some really convoluted way of making a simple test and was like "Isn't Ruby great?!"
Invi: Youtube style. :P
I'm like no... that's awful code and it makes no sense
yeah... don't you have any suggetions? ^^
Invi: that was a response to your snake comment
ah ^^
is anything streaming
Invi: do you have ponyville summer?
nope
Invi: maybe....the AVGN theme?
bad idea :D
hmm...
it's really ironic too because he used to lecture us all the time about making sure our code is readable; I could look at this monstrosity he wrote and forget what it meant within 5 minutes
but ponyville summer is too long :<
Invi: 1 minute intro btw
I'm going to be busy for a while. Be back later
Safari|foal, yeah, but I have only 1 minute 26 left 6_9
oh i found sth nice :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbIGnY_DSIE haven't heard that for a long time :D
Invi: I just have "best of pony tunes" 1 & 2 on, p
*on my phone
Plus my favourites otherwise
I have about 7,1 hours of mostly brony metal on my Computer ^^
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #613
there's that many brony metal songs?
Invi: its not metal, but are you familiar with the rock song mandopony made for sibsy's birthday?
Dken2021, well yeah, but i haven't heard much from Bronyfied lately. I hope he is going to do sth with the new season ^^
Alchemist, i know mandopony but don't listen to his music ^^
Invi: I have the complete pony music archive on mine --- 28 GB of pony music. :P
Dont like it?
never even tried ^^
Good morning BronyState :)
Safari|foal, nice ^^
Mornin AdamTheDuck
hai AdamTheDuck
No stream?
Good morning/ afternoon AdamTheDuck :)
I would stream a gif of the buffer symbol, for like 10 minutes, then turn on my mic and whisper into it untill some one caught on.
It would be an awesome troll
well, if i might, I will give you this one tehn. I think its catchy and spirit lifting :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziDlLXxa6so

mentioned*
and i'm blue
especially this one guy
he talks so much shit.
Thanks, Polydunami
but techically hes not my employee, hes my grandfathers employee so i cant fire him
otherwise he would have been gone a long time ago
This is awesome.
No probs :3
is luna talking?
This site has grown so much since I last visited.
Thats what happens when family is involved :/
XD
why is he like that?
This site really has grown
11,01I talk too low in this. :/
i realy like here mane
no Kawaii_icybeauti
does he own some of the business?
WHAT.
no
Ohai Kawaii_icybeauti :)
he tells people he does though
So whats with the guy then?
ah
Nittany_Discord You don't want to sound like a 13 year old, do you?
hes one of those small men who try to make themselves look big.
lol
"small man syndrome" its called.
heh
What does he do?
HI MICHAEL!!!
tells everyone about his millions of dollars and how many houses he has and crap like that
Is She From Latvia? o. o
Kawaii_icybeauti: I see what you mean now, or hear.
yet he comes and works and gets $15 an hour.
11,01Wubstep: Yes.
/me hugs weegee2062
Is that in Russia?
Wait, Really?
Thanks ^^
11,01It's next to Russia.
Latvis is NEXT to Russia :$
Just general stuff around the yard, helps customers, loads animal feed into peoples vehicles.
wheres his "millions" that he speaks of
*Latvia
/me hugs michael back
they dont exist.
11,01It was part of the USSR.
To the west.
wtf
Explains the accent.
right, bye
they exist only in his head.
I personally think the Russian accent is best accent.
floof
he spends at least 10 minutes with each customer bullshitting them about himself
to try to make himself look like a big man.
I dunno, Germans have sexy accents too :3
i find it funny :)
High school, same here
unless your there
Yeah, that's true.
we need to meet up
If im there he doesnt say anything.
exactly
because he knows i know its all bullshit.
cause hes probably scared of you
I tell him off all the time.
I have a southern accent :)
Wha, her real name :O
lovely style she had :D
and he talks back I assume?
has*
O_o
tries to but hes not very good at it.
11,01Yeah. I love her art style.
hah
I like my britsh accent, it is formal but not sterotypical :P
Tumblur is hated! by her at least
I also try to insert little jabs and pokes here and there
11,01She actually has a second ask blog now.
I Have an Irish Accent Cuz Im Irish O3O
like hes selling this customer a pair of boots
:O
and he says "yeah these boots are good for smaller men because of the way they fit"
she has an ask blog :o?
Sounds like hed be a good salesmen
cool
Link discord?
send me link pelase :D?
I just found out Something is 19 :$
so of course i walk by and say "hey jim, why dont you grab a pair?"
he is a good salesman.
very good.
Seriously? That's cool.
He should sell cars
It's not exactly private information :P
except he breaks rule #1 of sales. he talks about himself.
As in, she disclosed it herself on her DA
She sounds older. Maybe the accent? Because my Russian friend sounds about five years older than he actually is.
Nittany_Discord: can you send me the link to her blog :)? I'd like to see that :D
i dont speak anything correctly because im finnish:P
he has issues too, my dad and I started a new business last year and we are doing pretty well, so he tries to cause problems because hes jelious.
the first human that could fly, would be afraif of flying
I can no speak anything but English
11,01Yeah. Ask Pegasus Lola http://ask-pegasus-lola.tumblr.com/ is her main blog. Her second one is Ask Lola and Tiny Bold. http://ask-lola-and-tiny-bold.tumblr.com/
His son is a jackass as well.
like father like son.
And even then, I talk English not well :P
Spider Dragon
Wait, are we talking about another business? or the same one
well how this works is
Spider Dragon? This is now canon.
my dad and I operate a business out of the same property that my grandfather has his business
so we often share employees.
That is sexy :3
I see
Is that why you dont trust them?
11,01Spike Da Dragon. It's another Tumblr.
what movie are they doing today
Is she watching the chat?
no I dont trust him because he lies.
The Spider Dragon, Revoultionary at its finest pixel
11,01No.
who lies?
She's already asleep
It's maybe midnight already in Latvia
everyone.
Oh, I thought it was Spider Dragon. Oh well, it is a still canon.
o.o
no one knows how to tell the truth.
I like how Something draws human versions of the pony characters. The translation is a lot less awkward than most humanized ponies :D
Anything this woman says is canon.
Not sure what to say on that..
when you're blue, fire a few.
They WANTED to fly
When did this go from something else to the Wright Brothers?
actually it doesnt make sense to fire him
If the employees are shared how do you expect to fire them
because they are either on my payroll, or my grandfathers payroll.
Yea true, but i meant people that were born to fly
Are you implying that nobody flied before?
but they work for both companies.
If it were possible
Ever heard of hot air balloons?
did i hear "when i see ponies, saw mcdonalds?"
you dont fire senior employees though because you have to pay them big $$ in severence
oh all right then :$
Floating = Flying?
for jim, probably would cost like $20-$30k on severence.
Rainbow Dash! >3< :D
hes been bullshitting here for like 6 years
Pinkie Pie. What did I tell you? This woman is canon.
Hi everypony!
Hai Fluttershyfan158 :)
Hey there, Fluttershyfan158

No
Yes.
hiyah Fluttershyfan158
It's pre-recorded, Fluttershyfan158
hence why you said cameras
oh..Seems like a radio show..
or cutting hours.
cutting hours works well.
I need to go idle, but what is coming up missing?
present from my sister... yet i dont have a sister
Trailer axles and tires.
"A chewtoy for my puppy."
I miss last night when they were playing Looney Tunes..
about $2k worth of stuff went missing this morning.
Wait what

Chewtoy? pony? Never

First rule about DerpyGate is that we don't talk about DerpyGate

Whenever I hear the name Ditzy Doo..I get emraged.
She still going to have a speaking part just with a different speaking voice

Hey Nittany_Discord, if you were given a chance to participate in the show as a voice actor for a future episode, what would you say? My response would go along the lines of, "I am not worthy!"
11,01Forgot what Scott said about copyright then.

He sounds so....bored.
"I should know, I am Booored"
12 Miserable Bastards.
Jack Klugman is the only juror in this movie who is still alive.
Oh, the amount of refrences.
The judge looks so enthused.
04"I'm totally gonna act like I'm disinterested and drink this water"
Where's larry, moe, and curly with their parrot!
If this is the movie I think it is, I may have vague memories of it from way back in middle school...

How long until a visible haze of stale smoke hanging above the table.
BaconMane, oh god
So there's a new deadline for the lottery?
BaconMane: .........

so I'm not going to say how [comment redacted]
First time attending a movie night, I don't suppose we have a break? ^^
/me a sudden silence as the film begins
I forgot: Is Henry Fonda in this(as actor, not producer)?
BaconMane: I'm having nightmares tonight, thanks
Floris: We do, actually.
KaitoThePony: Is at my house but on a different PC because I am having surgery
no wait chats crashed
The talking dog did it
Floris: We have an intermissions. :)
Floris: After the movie
05,15Floris we have an intermission
*intermission
Ah, nice.
04Darn New York windahs!
He's there; the man with the white suit, SirGanjalf
KaitoThePony: I told the ponies
00,10yep lets make the jury as uncomfortable as posable
Floris: 20 minutes after the first pony episode.
Floris, after the movie is a pony episode, then a 20 minute intermission
Floris: Intermission is after first pony episode
why did I text myself
we got a new pony in the herd?
how do you vote on the next movie? just askin?
Oh, right Polydunami
Seems legit.
04"Hey, can ya help me Bob? I wanna kill myself"

mid-50's OP
I've been here awhile, just didn't attend 'em movie nights. ^^
Welcome Floris!
KaitoThePony: CUZ YOU = DUM cousin
Sumica: XD
why are most of them wearing suits if its the hottest day of the year then
That One is best juryman.
I *DO* remember this movie now!
"Quick, i don't wanna get late for the baseball match"
alexxm|foal: because jury duty
yay
JeisuTheUma: ....
damn dis buffers
CrimsonPhoenix: I get lazy and just use alt combinations >_<
04YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE
Everyone wore suits back then, especially to a courtroom
05,15alexxm|foal because that was the fashion back then
08,01there's a sequel to this, y'know
00,101957
alexxm|foal: Because its a courtroom. And, yes, jury duty.
05,15Only a low life wouldn't wear a suit
08,01it involves the accused stealing the jury's eggs
alexxm|foal: Because the old days and people wore suits a lot back then
LOL Sumi! :D 2 a man
12 happy men?
why is the yay longer than normal
there should be a remake
08,01it's called 12 Angry Birds
ba dum tss
..........
0,5hehee
HWOOOAGH
alexxm|foal: Back then, EVERYONE wore suits that weren't immediately involved in farming of factory work. CERTAINLY in court.
13that was terrible...
louder 6_9
Bad joke is bad and you should feel bad.
This movie was remade, OohShiny.
where does the yay's keep coming from?
"I almost fell asleep" WHOAAH!
Ocean's 12 Angry Men
Stereotypical nerdy guy.
/me 08,01gets his coat
00,10booooooooooooooo
OohShiny: There was a remake. I think it's Russian
That guy gives me the impression of a rich guy.
Lol
the movie is streaming, why is regular chat still ded? :(
stupid adds
/me is summoned by Sumi
The remake is called "12"
I'm so happy I didn't actually have to go to jury duty once.
"I've never been on a jury before!" ... You don't get out much do you son?
ENTITLED?
heavy voice, nice suit..
11,01Miksu4: Adblock Plus.
richfiles, no. The foreman gets 13 of them. Everyone else just gets one
HWOOOAGH
This nerd guy is the one who voiced Piglet.
Why are the pings extra loud?
Those kids today, eh sir?
I've only got called for jury duty once, didn't have to server.
Please stop it with the pings
/me shrugpony.
link?
hello Doctor Kliener!
Mayhaps people will show up an hour late.
AlienWarhead: they scream a lot in the movie... jk
I love how the pings always ALWAYS happen at the perfect time for maximum funny.
08,01RANdOM MOVIE TRIVIA: As shooting of the film went on, director Sidney Lumet gradually changed to lenses of longer focal lengths, so that the backgrounds seemed to close in on the characters, creating a greater feeling of claustrophobia.
this black and white keeps switcjing to green and white
I was actually sort of afraid it would turn out almost exactly like this movie, only the accused wasn't for a murder but some traffic law violation or something.
0,5booooooooooooooo
I suppose that man has a cold? He sure likes to sniff his cloth.
Tastes like pans-galactic gargle blaster Sumi.
The random noises are annoying :@
Kurra: yet people dislike when it happens
0,5STOP DOIN DAT SUMI
I've been called a few times-- only have serveed once, and the case was completely without reasonable doubt.
/me 08,01is the new Silverscreen
Yep save the pings when it's appropriate, like save the oh mys for when its needed.
04There is only one Silver :(
^
^^\\
^^
And thats how i lost my medical liscense!
08,01i miss sibberscweem

There ish only Zuul
Ghosties: there can be only one
What do those FX keep coming from?
^
hey everypony!

this movie's volume is a tad low
and how!
00,10you realise how dumb that was yes BaconMane?
smrtgy1: Because people keep pinging Sumi
What happened to Silverscreen, anyway?
Hi, Bloxx.
Hey Bloxx
and how
They allow smoking in the room
them colds, so hawt
hai Bloxx
inb4 Gentlemen, there's a Spy among us!
this is a really long continuous shot.
Has anyone here had jury duty? I got called up once, but they ended up settling while we sat in the booth before selection started
how've you been Bloxx
Are we still on the first shot?
0,5I dont get it!
sorry Bjornfot, otakon isn't here for you to rape yet
Midnight_Fyre: I almost did.
Fluttershyfan158, the mod who is streaming this is getting pinged.
Red Spy is in the Jury!
ROHKARA: At the time, they allowed smoking narly everywhere.
oooh.
I have the sudden urge to watch MSK3K now
I've never been on jury. Thankfully.
They sure all like to sit on the table.
MrBen: Left for home or somewhere with bad internet connection, which cut out his time here
The butler did.
J_E_Smith71: Ah.
iy
Nuuuh, it's not rape. He likes it.
This guy is a jackass :|
Yeah, you bet.,

... Go Cleveland.
04Suddenly different shade of sepia
05,15shhhhomp
FFFFoom.
FFFOM
Shhhhomp
ffffffffffo
ffffoooom!
0,5FFFFHOOMP
The butler did it. It's ALWAYS the butler.
real WHAT handler??? O.O;;;
consensual rape?
The Golden Age of hats
J_E_Smith71: So I take it he's no longer a mod here, then, at least until further notice?
08,01jug handler.
50 shades of grey
Let it be!
08,01he handles jugs.
Even though it still can be rape even if the victim likes it.
MrBen: Yep he stepped down
04Juror 47's gonna do a hit on all the other jurors
05,15Let's not talk about rape okay?
J_E_Smith71: Alright. Thanks.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: I have 1/3 - 2nd time cut -3rd time nobody was chosen for jury
pony_666: porn for kids?
JUROR IS SPY
08,01Ghosties: funny you should say that; i was just about to tell a similar story about when i was on a jury
04Have not
why does the shade keep changing
Talk about regular sex instead.
Ghosties It's pretty good
fine...we'll talk about necrophilia then
brb
Atleast now we know who's the Spy; Guy wearing Fancy Fedora, ofc
Dammit@! Are you people talking about rape again?
I Sneezed
:)
05,15No don't talk about that either
00,10then start, dosei t matter where you stand?
Why not? Rape is not even NSFW. Is it because it's sensitive to some?
molestation?
08,01this was the infamous "almost thrown out of court" story
Oohshiny arnt all romance novels girl porn?
08,01it's better if i tell it over voice
that medic is a spy!
08,01ask me next time i stream
he's ded
04Baltimore?! Them's fightin' words!
ack! no...
How good were the forensics back then anyway?
05,15How about we take this in another direction
dat unprofessional conversation
Poking bears here flutters.
hentai?
04BALTIMORE?!
I like the old man
KJ Basic
I like that old man.
Maybe you should do what the usual reaction to this chat is and go hang out in mane instead.
pony_666: well, 50 shades actually has sex scenes
Polydunami, I like you!
Baltimare
:$
Yo whats up everypony
04Baltimore man is now my favorite character
Hit with a crowbar? Let Gordon do it for you!
hey Moopy!
Hi, Moopy. :)

04Hello Moopy
05,15How about no, seeing as this is still an official room and the rules will be enforced as such
the comfy chair
Oohshiny so do most romance novels im the 4th twilight has sex in it
Hi Moopy
how's it goin?
Hi
I like the guy in the black and white

The chair? Like.. the corner with the Dummy hat on?

I recognize a bunch of these guys from the Twilight Zone
Good
Only when you feel like it.
Floris: yeah
00,10why an even number
00,10I will never get it.
04And one won't
well, movies over
/me raises hand
Ghosties in a real jury, it wouldn't be so clear cut ^^'
Never, ever do open voting.
That old man goes with the flow.
Either go police the chat that actually needs it, or police them equally.
D:
Ok. What are everyone's thoughts on Assassin's Creed III?
04BAM
04Huh
/me raises hand
O COME ON!
what about when otakon gets here and Bjornfot sees him, then can we talk about it?
Looks like he just made 11 men angry.
Never got interested in the franchise.
Because it leads to this movie.
1 not guilty
fail
04This seems awwwwfully familiar to a Hey Arnold! episode
nor did i
I wanna kick that old stuck up guy.
INTEGRITY!!!
^^^
"there's always one" what a jackass
Ghosties Durrrhmm...
05,15Meanwhile we can't be everywhere at once, but we can take care of things as we see them.
Ghosties Hey arnold! Is a fantastic artform :D
Assassin's Creed seems like my kind of game...but i just stuck with what i had.
That Henry Fonda is a SPY!
00,10but do you want the kid to be dead
18 is old enough. 14 is not.
08,01i love this film
Here's an interesting pony idea..A BLACK AND WHITE THEMED EPISODE! and not a bit part!
well it was gonna be a short movie if it went if someone didn't oppose
00,10that is the point
@Ghosties its based off this play
This guy's lonely.
Take off your damn hat
Umm hey sumica that #Rainbow Dash thing showed on my screen here and it shouldn't be like that
Except when you choose to ignore it. Look, I don't care which it is, but pick one option or the other. Don't flipflop.
He sure doesn't know much.
I really shouldn't be given Jury duty. I'm too aspergers for that.
I'm good thanks
04The entire episode was centered around Arnold and his colleagues being jurors for a school case against one of their friends, and Arnold was the only one that was like "Not guilty" and then explained why. Eventually he managed to prove the guy innocent
hey amu
Those voting guilty? *Everyone raises their hand* Okay, lets go *credits play*
I think it's a shame how MURRIKUHN it is. The previous games were not very "Italian" or marketed towards Italians...
00,10rainbowdash thing?
did rd chance position 0_0
I've never been chosen for jury duty, and I hope I never do.
good for you, fancy fedora
And then movie last for 101 years
05,15I don't choose to ignore things, maybe others do. But when I see things, I take action. I can't catch everything
Sumica: RD channel, I think.
Ghosties: well, I know how this movies going to end then
Yeah like this #Rainbow Dash
Ghosties and that one of the jurors was?
00,10What about it?
This story has been parodied endlessly.
PWNT
This is what I call an Actin' Film.
So side channels are now open?
Cool story, bro
so, 12 guys around a table, discussing if the defendant is guilty or not... for about 96 minutes?
The new guy is really intense.
04Can't remember who did it
SCREW YOU FULL O YOURSELF OLD MAN HAHA
Better than it sounds, OohShiny
This already has me interested. I want to see these guys want each other dead.
i like big nose
Ghosties kid with bowler cut
Lets Just Sit There For The Lols : D
damnit, I'm late again, am I?
04Like I said OohShiny at the beginning of the opening credits
[19:08:54] <EleanorAwesome> je vois de la creme glacée
See, this is why you have 12 jurors in the first place. So you have a good pool of people thinking about the issue.
can I please hear that story now?
hey! anypony wanna watch some twilight??
/me SHOOM hooves
ohai ekips
Ghosties, I remember that! Is that the one when Harold and his friends mooned the principal and Arnold was threatened to have a mark on his record?
04Two hours. Jurors talking.
Ghosties did it cause Eugine wrecked his pencil :P
1 Angry kid
well i don't know if i should be going into that and chat in there
Sparkle!
ohai Michael :3

04I can't remember the ep, sorry :s
Ghosties: interesting... NOT
04I just remember it was like this
so when dose teh fightin seens strt?
Fluttershyfan158: After the movie...oh wait it's a Rarity episode
....Father :'(?
04I admit, this is a really interesting concept
i remember the robot chicken paraody of this
12 Angry Ponies... :|
04But in film...I'm not so sure
lol where's the baysplosions
Ghosties: but as I love to participate in BMN, I will watch it
@ghosties there was also a king of the hill episode that parody this except instead of discussing a court case they voted on weather or not they would start making a lawn mower with a bunch of bells and whistles
yeah, tell him!
Old man goes !
Well, since the general reaction is to just pay more attention to mane since really, we don't need it. Maybe you should take a leaf out of the book.
GO!
Secret of My Excess
05,15Ghosties this is a classic :(
old man enrages
HOORAY OLD WISE MAN
Old Man is a badass.
We're grown ups! We shouldn't have to talk like adults!
Its a contest to figure out which two people sound the most alike.
i dont like big nose anymore
mmmm rice pops
Rice Pops
04I'm hoping it's good
I think it's worth noting that Malcom in the middle directly references this episode at some point
^w^
Ghosties: the episode is called flase alarm
13Enough.
My Angry Pony... My Angry Pony... ARRRGH!!! :[
that dude needs some art tumblrs
Not trying to be depressed about it i was just saying though
*false alarm
04Actually, I'm hoping it carries my attention
/me doesn't share cheese danishes

04SAW was another movie that mostly took place in a decrepit bathroom and it certainly held my attention
he sounds like Piglet from Winnie the Pooh
???
OJ lol
Aww, let the man be!
Tovler: It is
He wore hipster glasses before people that wore them before they were cool
This movie has some nice editing.
HE SOUNDS ABOUT 60 YEARS YOUNGER THAN HE IS
Yet again, the point of this room is for lols outside of the usual chat avalanche.
All of Buried took place in a wood coffin and that was INTENSE.
Hello Dr. Kliener!
J_E_Smith71: O.O
Ghosties: it's a fucking do-or-die game... of course it's good
baktu (thats how you say no in a language I just made up)
05,15Think of it this way, at least it's not Waiting for Godot
00,10fact, no one saw it
"Let the bodies hit the floor..."
Ghosties: it's also a police novel
Ishese?
^^
11,01It's not a place to be obscene or inappropriate Meanwhile.
let the bodi- dammit SirGanjalf
Yep the nerdy guy is John Fielder, Piglet's original VA
04@OohShiny: But I generally enjoy the idea of movies that take place in one setting
Flooooooooorrooooar
OBJECTION
This guy was manufactured by IBM
lol
04The difference here is that it's law
Tell that to them. I just want a danish.

/me takes Meanwhile's danish
cowvarkian: They made HAL 9000 too

That doesn't matter if it had passengers!
Saw wasn't more than torture scene after torture scene, I couldn't get into it.

Fluttercry "YOU LIEE TO MEEE!"
I played L.A. Noire...it was fun, but the interrogation parts irritated me...
Doubt
okay, what did I miss? ^^
USO DA!!!
Invi: Nothing much. :)
05,15L.A. Noire was stressful
Lie
04@Invi: BALTIMORE?!
String_Shredder: don't you mean Johnny Five (Short Circuit reference FTW)
LA Noire was fun but pretty repetitive, especially at the beginning.
/me did not celebrate Halloween this year
fluttercry: ikr
Ghosties, who?
00,10without a resonable doubt.
Fluttercry but dumb
Actually, the defendant and the female witness are both from the slums. I don't know if this is about racism but discrimination against class.
Dat Cough
String_Shredder: SSSSHHHHAAAAUUUUUUNNNN!!
11,01I did a bit this year, but I didn't dress up.
Everytime time I messed up questioning someone, I wanted to go back and try AGAIN!
He sounded like he's about to drop dead.
Ghosties: Applecore, Baltimore, who's your friend?
OMFG 12 ANGRY JURORS! MY HIGH SCHOOL IS DOING THIS PLAY AND IM IN IT :O:O:O6_9
I loved L.A. Noire but I didn't like the last part
I marathoned a couple of Halloween movies and ate chocolate.
12 Angry Men
WHATEVER
It's Jurors because they want women to be equal
SlyTag I'm envious
04Hell yeah, Baltimore man's talking
Hey everypony! :)
Never played L.A. Noire, not planning on doing so
L.A. Noire's ending was a bit dissapointing
Murder mutabuka

Hi, Klumzeedragon. :)

He's going into the women's room!
WOw This movie is quite good at this point
that guy has point the kid may have reached the breaking point

AlienWarhead: He drowned in shiz didn't he?
Hi Klumzeedragon
I only played in one play in school, sadly :/
LAs ending sucked
am I the only one getting buffers?
imma be the guy with the hat lol!
Dose It Day Women On The Window of the Door?
So......from what i can guess.....this movie focuses in the character's past?
Meanwhile: What did you watch?
Real handy with a knife, he could be a chef.
Kids these days..
05,15Invi everyone in the jury but one man claims the man is guilty

SB, put some clothes on! :O

BaconMane: that'S as old as mankind itself. sokrates once said the same thing
08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days.
H2O doesn't sound like a Halloween movie?
BaconMane: One E
yep
0,5I know :P
I'm gonna make a man out of you
Halloween H2O
I BEAT HIM
BaconMane: except he was even angrier about it^^

This movie might as well take place in Fishman Island.

And this is coming from a guy who had a bad connection for month and used to have buffers all the time
this guy's cool.
He just meant you POOR people! And Black folk!

Oh leave Halloween alone. It's an excuse for scary stuff and free sweets. Both of which are awesome.
And no one wants to give me any since I'm 19... :c
Wait, there was a movie?

It's not exactly action packed, but this is still a good film.

Remember that movie where we saw a guy trapped in a box the whole movie?
Did someone say... 'The Room'?
Or even better Kingdom Hearts!
Fluttershyfan158, indeed someone should

Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.
Switch blade
Faaaaaaaat.
Ouroboros: megashark vs giant octopus
I lurv KH!
For science
he sounds like he's 7
08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Henry Fonda was asked by United Artists to make this film, so he did it as both actor and producer. He was, however, very frustrated at being producer and decided never to do so again.
the switch knife
There is a little something called "reasonable doubt."
"STFU Nerrrd!"
Xd
AJIsAwesome: hope its rifftraxed
OJ, ours always wanted to but wasn't allowed
Oh :) Thanks Michael.
A second? He spoke like once.
OohShiny: Me too. :D

You betrayed the law!

The knife, what does it mean?!
Mistrial?
isn't jurers getting themselves evidence illegal?
...Actually it is very possible
04Balitmore man looks like Al Bundy up close
It means that drop is high, sir
I like this movie!
I WANT TO BELIEVE
I thought so too alexxm|foal
They are correct, possible, but not probable
$6.00 in 1957 had the same buying power as $49.06 in 2012.

He doesn't want to prove him guily. He just wants them to be -SURE- before they condemn him to death.
Knife's nice looking, but can't be that well built for 6 bucks.
Meanwhile were you? *dunh dunh DAAAAAHHH!!!*
*guilty
04That guy has risen from his chair like 8 times since the start 15 20 minutes ago
He started with the knife and then he complains, hehe.
If you don't want to be there all nigh just have the guy arrested fore bringing a switchblade into the courtroom and then revote without him
The Golden Age of suspenders
00,10the big deal is he dont think the kid deserves to die
SlyTag: M...maybe. I don't knooooow! D:

oh hay twilight_sprinkle ^^
Shut up, foreign guy! You're foreign!
hey Invi :)
What the hell does the prosecuter know about law anyway? :P
08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Most of the hard-working (relatively inexperienced) crew were longshoremen. Because there wasn't enough movie work to feed them all year, they'd have two union cards: their Local 52 cards and their ILA cards.
00,10if they say guilty the kid dies

legally, a juror can vote any way they want for any arbitrary reason. There is nothing the judge can do to stop them.

otakon the French racist dwarf hobbit mermaid etc
I haven't been here in so long. But I had to come for this movie
04ANGER
I HAD TO
Thanks for watching my pick
and we are at the reverese of where it all started
04ANNNNNGERRRRRRRR
I'm out
The ending scene of the movie is the kid asking for his "Stabbin-Knife" back because he's "Gots some more white folks ta kill." :P
yes that otakon
The glasses guy isn't as big of a jerk as the other two left.
Pale_Horse really?
bonjour
il be seeing you....
hello
"I'm a robot and your arguments are illogical"
hai RAWRity
the galsses guy is just concerened with facts
Anypony said otakon?
Pale_Horse: spoilers
The glasses guy is still depending on facts
Derpderpderpderp he's the most logical
Wait, if this is 1957, then the kid grows up to be the Spy in the 60's?
:P
Data 1.0
So how's chat reacting o this movie so far?
Kurra: :D
0,5Believing i am right while people around me keep not listening to me, i know dat feel /).(\
otakon can't make movie night much these days because of work conflict.
He is more depending on ruling out the evidence of him being GUILTY
Angry fuck still sitting in the corner XD
hi juror 10 in the corner
Mostly about closeups
Bjornfot not here unfortunately
So whats the point but heres my question Gulity or not Gulity? and it can not be both so you have to choose which one
I just started watching
05,15RAWRity they're liking it surprisingly
Kurra: Ah, so the old guy is racist against french.
And the number of times someone's been burned.
...look i dunno, mebbeh hes right, but maebbe hes naht
05,15I was expecting people to complain
It looks like it'd be a good movie if I watched it from the beginning...
SirGanjalf, I dunno if that's true
I love this movie, but I know the chat is rather flightly with stuff like this.
across the L train, in the middle of the night, and was STILL able to positive ID the perp?
hi guys. Is this 12 angry men? I really enjoy this movie
I say "Guilty"
that... is damn good eyesight
Yep.
<.< nice hair
ah... dis movie
04So now it'll be more in favor of guilty
04Yep
"Frankly, i don't give damn.
Friendchips: yes
hey Phase4
I Say Not Guilty
yes friendship it is
hai Friendchips
i still say he looks more guilty than not
o hai guize
I just rechecked. The kid is white.
you should read the screenplay
its execlent
00,10WE WILL GO OVER IT AGAIN!
is it that easy to fake murders?
NO!
if it's a hung jury, then the jury would be dead
Old guy looks like he's about to break down and cry.
So guys, Guilty or Not?
the guy looks like the Green Goblin um, actor guy from Spiderman.
J_E_Smith71: xD
wouldnt the baseball game be canceled anyway due to the storm?
05,15J_E_Smith71 that would be a hanged jury
Granted, there IS a huge issue. When that guy started doing his OWN invesigation, he should have been kicked out immediaely
Mad Men guy is hesitant
Omg stop changing your votes guys you already voted so theres no way to changeing the votes so its to late for that

bronies are weird. Of course we wear glasses to bed
J_E_Smith71: moc
Capped it myself, already on it.
If I had flexible glasses, I'd wear them to bed
Okay. For those who DO wear their eyeglasses to bed... What exactly do you need them for while you're sleeping? :P
YES
08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Nominated for 3 Oscars, the film lost out in all its categories to The Bridge on the River Kwai.

my guess is that he killed the boy
I dont have duuuuuuuuuh
i Stare in to your buffer.... and your soul...
ANGER 100% , +2000 POINTS
So he's guilty until proven innocent to him?
I've heard people say this movie is about overcoming prejudice, but more than that, I think it's really about showing people the power of critical thinking.
Can you proove the justice of our culture?
It's over 900- Oh wait.
Oh gawd he mad
*man
whens the next movie??

I still think the kid is guilty
HE'S MAD WITH RAGE
0,14it's clearly Jesus magic!
RAGE QUIT
I've got all the WHAT'S here?
08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Sidney Lumet had the actors all stay in the same room for hours on end and do their lines over and over without taping them. This was to give them a real taste of what it would be like to be cooped up in a room with the same people.
An angry and insulting raging guy reminds you most of liberals? Not the Glenn Becks and Rush Limbaughs?

....that's....very emotional
OH SNAP
Ghosties: he tried to make a 'man' out of his son and his son got in a fight with him and ran away from home.
05,15Wow
</3
08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Because of the demands of the film's low budget, if the lighting was set up for a shot that took place from one particular angle, all the shots from that same angle had to be filmed then and there. This meant that different sides of the same conversation were sometimes shot several weeks apart.
He beated his son and hadn't seen him in years
he just had problems with his son :(
05,15This film is powerful
good thing i watched ballad of the brony to get to here
They don't prove him innocent. They just declare that there's reasonable doubt as to his guilt.
0,5Im feeling yhis

05,15Sumica I was so into the movie I didn't even notice that
And the guy helped No. 3 with his coat.
Nittany_Discord, it coopted a lot of innocent people who just wanted to lash out at who they thought was the cause of their misfortune. But the heart of it is pure evil.

12/10
08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: As the film failed to make a profit, Henry Fonda never received his deferred salary. Despite this setback, Fonda always regarded 12 Angry Men as one of the three best films he ever made, the other two being The Grapes of Wrath and The Ox-Bow Incident.
I'm gonna suggest to my friends.
