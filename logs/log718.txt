Have you ever restored a computer using a system image on multiple dvds?

Righto. Understandable.
its supposed to be the entire hard drive
whath time is
unless that just backs up files?
you?
I don't know, I tried using some build in packardbell backup tool
if there are some important data on the backup, I think there should be way to get them out
no there is no important data
then get a new/used hard drive that at least has that much GB
ok here it is http://www.youtube.com/user/RazorWing1269?feature=mhee
But if its too much work, I might just go with another computer
yeah

That One is best juryman.
I *DO* remember this movie now!

04YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE
Everyone wore suits back then, especially to a courtroom

08,01there's a sequel to this, y'know
00,101957

Dammit@! Are you people talking about rape again?
I Sneezed
:)
05,15No don't talk about that either
00,10then start, dosei t matter where you stand?
Why not? Rape is not even NSFW. Is it because it's sensitive to some?

05,15Meanwhile we can't be everywhere at once, but we can take care of things as we see them.
18 is old enough. 14 is not.
00,10that is the point
Except when you choose to ignore it. Look, I don't care which it is, but pick one option or the other. Don't flipflop.
He sure doesn't know much.
I really shouldn't be given Jury duty. I'm too aspergers for that.
I'm good thanks
hey amu
Those voting guilty? *Everyone raises their hand* Okay, lets go *credits play*
I think it's a shame how MURRIKUHN it is. The previous games were not very "Italian" or marketed towards Italians...
00,10rainbowdash thing?
I've never been chosen for jury duty, and I hope I never do.
And then movie last for 101 years
05,15I don't choose to ignore things, maybe others do. But when I see things, I take action. I can't catch everything

08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Because of the demands of the film's low budget, if the lighting was set up for a shot that took place from one particular angle, all the shots from that same angle had to be filmed then and there. This meant that different sides of the same conversation were sometimes shot several weeks apart.
He beated his son and hadn't seen him in years
he just had problems with his son :(
They don't prove him innocent. They just declare that there's reasonable doubt as to his guilt.
