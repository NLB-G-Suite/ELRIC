00,02also why look so bad :/
Its a beta
who speek french
a bit
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, it was used to make the meet the videos
00,02as well as most cutsceens for valve games
Rendering is the bad part of making a 3D video. :I
00,02i wonder
00,02think i know whats wrong
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, its the easy part
So, what's the problem? :I
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, not sure
Is it the video codec?
ded chat
Must've met up with Slenderman
I think it has something to do with specs.
I blame canada
It could be Canada's fault...
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11025839/SFM/mtt_pimp.png
MMD has a lot of these rendering problems too. I think you need at least 2GB of RAM and a Graphics Card with 1GB. :I
Not sure what are the required specs for Source FilmMaker, though.
and a cray2

...
00,02and it wont load
bye
00,02probably explains why theres only 2 players
Anotherguy whats the matter
never heard of anyone getting beaten up for watching a tv show - and that was from a friend? - I'd make it a point to let him know the consequences of his actions - how long have you been friend, if you dont mind my asking
about a year and a half
04Sounds like a pretty lousy friend
yer sad thing is he probley one of my only freainds
04If he's legit beating you up then you need to cut off your friendship with this guy since it seems like he honestly has some issues going on with you.
04Or issues going on himself
ikr
04Have you been to the doctor?
04Or at least tell your mom and dad?
nah it fine
i had my dad look at it
04And what did he say about your 'friend?'
noting much he dosent really like him thouge
00,02accidental taunt
04Eh, well, maybe you should spend some time away from him for a while. Or, possibly even talk to him even though this runs the risk of getting hit again.
Gotta love those Accidental taunts
screw him ill get him next time
04"Get him?" You mean beat him up back?
that does not sound like a good idea
yep
Okay, I'm back :)
04Violence only begets more violence
hey OtakuTom what have you been up to
driving home from work :P
OtakuTom: I just got to work.

wellc if he starts any thing ill end it
Interesting song
Why does all the TF2 have to go on when I'm at work? [frownyface]
Time zones
and the sun and moon
OmegaMetroidBrony: I know, but it is kinda... grr...
My PonyMy PonyMy PonyMy PonyMy Pony
lol mlp briefcases
It's usually going on when I'm at work, too. I've actually never played since I tend to have real bad experiences playing online FPS games. I actually plan on making a youtube series out of how bad I'll (probably) be when I finally start playing...lol
perfect for the businessmen
OtakuTom: sounds awesome
bomb quest
OtakuTom: I'm rather decent - my clan won its clan match on monday.
Pinkie Quest is best quest

Jim: you really like...its mane?
sprinkle_GS17: too mature
funny
Better than what I could do. My fiance keeps telling me I should practice drawing.
i forgot to give a cutie mark though :<
sprinkle_GS17, Yeah, but it was a bit too nsfw for my taste
I should be drawing more, but I've been busy with other stuff
my drawing sucks

00,02o i c
00,02odd place for a sentry
00,02did nothing
Rendering MMD at a reasonable frames per second.
Phase4: normally, I roll widowmaker, pistol, gunslinger but that is a rather mobile build...
dose this site have rules
00,02widowmaker uses a LOT of metal
Phase4: all you need to do is keep hitting
00,02i cant aim
The rain isnt going to let up anytime soon. Eventually, I'm just going to have to go out despite how hard it is
04Yes, B4L
I love rain. No matter how hard it is.
BRONY_4_LIFE: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
04Dammit, ninja'd by Omega
Phase4: and last week's map had 8 individual cap points so turtling wasn't an option
00,02dat sentry gun
00,02it got 3 kills
The rain will be just like this the rest of the week - front yard's already beyond flooded from the last 3-4 days of rain
So much rain everywhere else but here :<
00,02dis team is full of sillies
silly fillies
Hint: I'm rendering a video about Twilight Sparkle. :3
00,02had enough tf2 for now
Cypresswolf, I have a little bit of rain too.
O.O
its been raining on and off the whole week
Phase4: I can't wait for next week - I was told it is a KotH map~
BTW, I have a few more ideas for the Season 3 Lottery
00,02i'm not much for koth
00,02control point and payload for me
00,02other game modes kinda stagnate
I enjoy the rain - certainly not complaining after last summer - had no rain and the temps were over 100 for 90+ days straight
lol thats how it is here
00,02excuse me while i check my email
call upon the sea ponys is stuck in my head
Kandarihu what are your ideas
and as a contruction worker, I was working outdoors in it everday
I guess no one is excited about my Twilight Sparkle video.
00,02i forget what i'm chekcing
Mane 6 claims personal posession of the Elements of Harmony
00,02Excelent
00,0217th
00,02not 12th
Elements of Harmony become "so last season" and must be upgraded
Alternate (possibly evil) counterparts to Elements of Harmony appear (Elements of Discipline?)
Inb4 Elements of Harmony Magical Mares Transformation
Cypresswolf I also love the rain. This has been a great summer for me.
this confuses me
hmm
00,02what did i just watch
lol
i have no idea
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.....
One of the Mane 6 permamently ceases to be worthy of her element *cough*Rarity*cough* and must be replaced. Former Mane6 remains a recurring cast member.
ahh my keybord spamed -+ y yy

It's been quite cool the last few days - temps currently in the mid 70's - thats cold for a Houston summer
00,02uses source sdk
Dont even have to go to the beach to cool down, just go outside and stand in the rain :)
i watche all mlp ep and now im bored
BRONY_4_LIFE: make art, play games, writer fanfics
Play Fallout 3
yer okay
except i cant draw 4 ****
neither can plenty of us
But we still draw to get better
yer i should at lest try
Exactly
You should watch the earlier generations then
You might be surprised
Thats a bad idea... except for maybe the 1st gen Pilot
The one with the explosions and Sea Ponies
with my drawing skills, you can tell what animal or thing its supposed to be, used to do sketches of scenery, but can't draw ponies for horseapples
i got so bored i thought g3 might be okay
i was wrong
Damn right you were
okay...went AFK for a sec...what's going on now? some sort of 3D render?
00,02i'm failing misserably
http://derpy.me/TzOnX
G1 & 2 are acceptable - 3 isn't...that...bad - and 3.5 is right out
Are you typing that with a straight face?
00,02der we go
*poker face* maybe
00,02g2 is less ok than g1
G1 isn't bad
i fond g 2 verry odd
04G1 had RAINBOW OF DARKNESS, and Spike, and awesome heavy metal creature villains. So at least watch the pilot.
G1 had the best pilot
MFW people say G1 is bad http://i.imgur.com/qbgas.gif
G1 is the mature part of MLP
ive seen the my litte pony movie it g1
Ah...is Phase trying to learn how to make a TF2 map?
what happened to SFM?
also g1 had sea ponys
Don't forget the Smooze
OmegaMetroidBrony: can't stop it.
and the flutterponys
You can't escape it
It's Bacon and Applejack!
Sounds like Bronystate
Unstoppable and inescapeable
OmegaMetroidBrony: http://i.imgur.com/wfG7I.jpg
something G1 I saw when I first started getting into FIM looked very lazy in animation - maybe it was a movie - mouths wouldnt move when a character was speaking, some walking sequences the legs didnt move - pretty much floated across the screen

Morning, everyone.
00,02hmmm
00,02not sure if working
morning AttacktheAndalite
Moin AttacktheAndalite
Phase4: nope
/me hugs Jim and OmegaMetroidBrony
Phase4: party time
Phase4: or were you refering to yourself? I was talking about me.
hey AttacktheAndalite did you sleep well
Do what you want cause a pirate is free!
00,02dat worked
You are a pirate!
alexxm: Yep
that reminds me of animorphs
00,02PonyNegZero, ?
04YARR HARR FIDDLEDY DE
That's working just fine
Dat Ghosties *hugs*
you don't have anything to tell it to update what it is seeing
this map is weird
Being a pony is alright to be
so it is just remembering what it saw last
Reminds me of SCP-087-B
00,02PonyNegZero, actually theres no wall there
00,02source engine doesnt clear the screen
needs skybox :D
Phase4: that should be a problem with it not having anything to update it with
Did Pinkie break the fourth wall again?
i think so
Phase4: are you sure there is a wall there?
what is this 4 wall thing i dont get it
OmegaMetroidBrony which ones 087-B again
04<AttacktheAndalite> Dat Ghosties *hugs* <-- Oh, hello new person
087-B is like the staircase but its a massive tunnel
Ghosties: I'm not new, I've been here since November :3
oh that one thanks OmegaMetroidBrony
00,02PonyNegZero, i made a square tube, added the missing walls just now
04o_o I do not recognize you o_o
It must be the bricks and the lack of light
00,02wonder
00,02dont think i need to close tf2 each time
can somepony explan pinkie braking the 4 wall i dont understand
Ghosties: I'm AttackWithHugs. Or anything with Attack as the first name
Phase4: yeah, the engine doesn't "see" anything out the two holes, so it doesn't have anything to update, so it just remembers what it saw
04Oh yeah! That guy
04Welcome back ^_^
BRONY_4_LIFE: do you know what the 4th wall is?
not realy
wikipedia
Ghosties: girl* Lol thanks *hugs*
The 4th wall is what seperates the viewer from the show, as an example
00,02YOU ARE A LOOSE CANNON SANDVICH
BRONY_4_LIFE its sort of what keeps the viewers and a show sepreate
04Oops, sorry :/ Welcome back, miss :)
When breaking the fourth wall, you talk directly to the viewer, give them references to things in their universe that doesn't belong in yours
Ghosties: Thanks
00,02PonyNegZero, its not remembering so much as thats what happened to be in the framebuffer before hand
04:D
etc.
breaking the 4th wall is when the characters in the play/show become aware of the viewer
00,02most gpu;s have hardware clears these days
00,02but there should never be void visible
00,02so people tend not to care
and pinkie breakes it ?
Every time
Phase4: but it was still showing up, so it was remembering it since it had nothing to clear it with, in your case
often :D
she also breaks physics
pinkie is so random
That's why she's my favourite
^
00,02hmmm
00,02have to relaunch tf2 every time
she my fav to
i love pinkie<3
A good example of Pinkie breaking the 4th wall is at the end of Over a Barrel, where she holds open the closing shutter after Twilight says "You've got to share, you've got to care." to exclaim that she said it.
04Silly users, everybody knows Applejack is best mane pony~
Phase4: can't ya just load the map from the console?
00,02shana, that is a good point
Ghosties, I said favourite, not best
04Favorite, best, umbrella terms that mean the same thing in this regard :D
thank you everypony
i get it now
00,02aparently you can
Going to have to leave soon - http://www.khou.com/weather/radar?radar=70544977&img=1&c=y - all that stuff on the bottom half will hit the northeast side of town by the time I make my way over there later today O_o dont seen another way around it - have to get all the close locations taken care of first if I want to finish everything

Before I go on Bronystate: 2 tabs open. After I go on Bronystate: 1 million monies
I mean tabs
dat dubstep
Bronysith: I thought that was obvious, even for CoD players.
In 2142, there can be 4 people in choppers who use their regular weapons out the side - I once got 3 of my friends to just keep throwing RDX (c4) out the side of the video
Aye Bronysith
can't talk and type at the same time
Alchemist: false gamers only play for graphics
darn you coworker

Who else here has DirecTV?
http://cheezburger.com/6263298304
http://cheezburger.com/6260683008
well anyway I just lost 26 channels actually 20 million directv customers have
http://cheezburger.com/6255299328
now theyre just mix channels
it sucks
i honestly dont care about COD...i humans vs humans is a little boring...
no they wwere viacom
something about viacom and directv had a unrenewed contract
Chrysalis, that wasnt "explicit"
*i think
robotdragon8: unless it's cartoonish humans :D
not so much as discussing naked ponies, which they are already :)
http://cheezburger.com/6257307392
and at 11:45 PM almost midnight all 26 channels dropped
MudSurge lol
it was supposed to be 12:01 AM :p
I was watching friends on nick@nite
I read that, I suspect that there is going to be at least 19 million more cords cut by t he end of the week

wait what Broysith
Where's that Nittany Discord character. I'm done with his BronyState emblem in MC...
TV in general I should say, there was an artivle last month discussing why people were... ditching TV for internet
but yeah viacom were douches they wanted 30% morre money added to our bill
even for channels we dont watch!
why wont TV just die already
do everythin online
direcTV didnt follow and viacom suspended their channel at 11:45 PM
for some reason, i dont want TV to die yet....it feels like such a normal part of life.

08,01AttacktheAndalite: it's all or nothing, i'm afraid
08,01and i really can't be bothered putting clothes on now
Hi, whats going on?
The answer to whether or not you should do that soley depends on whether you're a mare or a stallion. If it's the former, possibly...
Streamer is getting eaten by Grue.
if the latter, than NO! SWEET CELESTIA NO!
hey Groogle i have no idea whats happening
Groogle sounds like porn and hi!
Hi Groogle
08,01i'm a mare

IMA PONEH
I like lady mares...
AJTheMightyGamer: That's a damn good Spy lol
IMA STEGOSAURUS
If a game hates me, I quit it. If a game hates me long enough and hard enough, I bust it.
thats what makes it fun Alpha-Omega
I really hate text adventure games
AttacktheAndalite: i guess so
They should at least remake this game with pictures
remaking a text adventure game with pictures might kill half the idea
hey activision just announced a zork remake
he could play kings quest
its a FPS
that was a text game with pics back in the day
with guns
Baptise bible in water.
and perks and killstreaks
throw holy water
and grues have been replaced with russians
cachi01: i c wat u did thar
11,01>Put on maid outfit
infact, the whole Zork was replaced by another CoD game
goin to school guys
become santa clause
whip candle, get hearts
Each game has a number of design decisions thrown in. THe "text based" could have been a "graphics are too hard" decision or a "lets leave this open to player interpretation" artistic type decision

cachi01: the first saw is the only really good one
looks cool IMO
they could of done SO much better
I would get an Android console
but a god damn java based console
OmegaMetroidBrony, good timing for it. I happened to win the movie lottery last Friday, and we're watching Wargames this Friday.
that thing had so much potential
O.O
Bronysith: the other ones gave me a really REALLY good laugh lol
and Dog and Pony show, my favorite episode
It was my first time too!
11,01I'd buy it over the closed next-gen consoles anyday (especially if the rumors hold true).
to be let down like that is a real shame
Bronysith: thats why i love them
cachi01: the other ones are for people on a gore fetish
so i took a nap and i had this dream.. i had MY OWN RAINBOW DASH
In the lottery.
Back
11,01Unless something mucks it up.
cachi01: the original had a good plotline i think and an INSANE twist
everypony is a spy pyro theres a spy in the chatroom
id buy it without hesitation if it was c/c++ based
That sounds like an excellent dream tehepicbrony
11,01Like game-interrupting ads during the free games.

$80 dollars is alot back then
$80 would buy you a good 100 Blind Bag ponies man
well, in 1885, $80 is like $800 now
00,10that's about the cost of a horse Eulshy, or two ponies
I thought a 24-pack cost like $60 or $80
O_O
Of blidnbags
101 PONIES
Blindbags*
And one horse makes alot of difference back in that day
dun dun duuuuuuun
Those boxes that the store shelves have
They sell them with $1 profit
$75 for the horse, $5 for a bottle of whiskey

What a scene.
00,10the better question I cant ask because of spoiler
those indians gunna scalp that car
CriticKitten and in 1887 plutonium doesn't exist yet. all that would be availible would be uraniukm or radium
EspyLacopa: Nah, that's white man tech.
Sumica: And yet it ALWAYS breaks down forcing them to find another way to operate the car. >_>
Espylacopa, they all see crazy shit like this all the time

Nice arrow.

IN THE KNEE.
CriticKitten: Mr. Fusion runs off of whatever.

I am sure the doc got some future insurance.
I know
no need for a bewm
wait... did doc go with him?
and then he made another one....
That covers time machine loss.

Shizuka, it takes a long time for a train to make an emergency stop.
And Marty then had to explain to his parents why he had a Genuine Cowboy's Hat.
Hey Beavis

Isnt that where they left her iteh second movie
13CriticKitten: that train shoulda started stoppin is what i'm saying :3
And they finally kiss.

So it IS Back to the Future 4
/me gives Shizuka a glomp and smiles :)
otakon: You know that's slang for clothes in some places right?
TheDoctor: SOON
SaxyPretender: you should chang your name SaxyDangerfield

/me 13goes back to hiding
Phase4: wrong word then. had the same broblem, folded the wire until i had a contact and taped it that way. it's 25% shorter now, but it works :)
SuperBrony64 Mind if I pm you something about this movie?
Shizuka: but don't hide!
0,14I spy a Shizuka
11,02Barbetos: Sure
Yeah the game's plot had stuff they wanted to show in the trilogy but couldn't, like going to the 30s and Doc's family history
/me offers Shizuka a cookie
I spy a spy
00,02Dark_Horst, i have a soldering iron :P can replace the cable
that is spying a Shizuka

You know, there was a perfectly appropriate Robot Chicken sketch for each of these 3 movies.

Mica is Sumica's R63 OC
Ehhh psychicpebbles parody of Terminator 2 was better that HISHE

OmegaMaidtroidBrony: BttF 3

O3O
11,01A maid?
I'd rather be watching Terminator Salvation
Dat FLeur
3
I love it when it dances
can she show her flank?
needs more MST3K ponies
o3o Why wub who?
Nittany_Discord I gave up tv for bronystate
DocSane: ikr
Ok, let's see how they pulled this one off.
But, if time travel was never invented, John's father wouldn't have been sent back in time, thus John wouldn't have been born to oppose the robots.
Did I get here just in time for T3?
Reikim yes. Yes you did.
seems so Reikim
Reikim: Yup
Reikim: eeyup
Reikim: Sadly, yes.
Just in time Reikim.
11,01GarettBrony: Nice I guess.
I AM TIME TRAVELER
EspyLacopa TIME TRAVEL
Tovler true dat
Reikim: just missed it
TIMEY WIMEY BULLSHIT
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
Reikim: but we are showing it again for you
11,01You can pretty much watch what you want on the internet anyway.
Andrew G. WAAAT?
Needs more Timey Wimey Detector
8,6oh look, the worst of the 4 :3
EspyLacopa: The universe eats time paradoxes for breakfast.
what's this?
StinkomanFan: Pffffft
Is this the 3rd movie?
o
yes
11,01TBH, I would love to reject this movie as canon.
A Not Made By James Cameron PRoduction
T3?
my headphones are so killing my ears right now
ok good
YEA
I don't feel like yellling science and stating random facts today
kirzstryfe: You consider 4 better that this?
Nittany_Discord: but YOU CAN'T! YOU CAN ONLY REJECT THE FOURTH ONE!
DocShane At least this is better than T4
waht would you rank the others kirzstryfe ?
Eulshy: kill them back then TAKE REVENGE!
THERE WERE ONLY 3.
I'm of the opinion that every time someone invents time travel, somem form of time paradox ends up destroying both the machine and the scientist who created it without otherwise affecting the timeline.
so I'm just going to STFU and watch this
8,6I found 4 to be more entertaining
0,14Salvation WAS better than this
kirzstryfe: This one should have never benn made..
Nittany_Discord: only if we can remove the 4th one as well
I've seen only the 2nd & Salvation, never the first or 3rd
ny
quick get the baking soda
Nah im busy watching that pony dance to inact revenge
EspyLacopa: makes sense, that's why we never hear about it
sonic rainboom
T4 was awesome just for Common's horrible acting.
Alright. Most of this movie I never even saw.
kirzstryfe: I haven't seen the 4th in a while
Dance Mica DANCE!
quick get the baking soda
*4th one
8,6T2 > T1 > T4 > T3
Lets play Fallout!
11,01I liked the open nature of the second's ending.
hello every pony
Xaiden: See the 1st at least
I've seen the first, most of the second, and Salvation
Kammerjunk: Nope, there were only 2. This one is some kind of spoof,
kirzstryfe: good scale but T3 is better than T4
oh my
yay
Conner was thirteen?
Humans don't need to look after the time stream, it's more than old enough to look after itself.
talei is shocked
*takei
"And now, because the producers said so, they're trying to kill me a third time."
11,01Mica looks sexy in that skirt, doesn't he?
