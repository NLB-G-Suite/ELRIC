You might be surprised
Thats a bad idea... except for maybe the 1st gen Pilot
The one with the explosions and Sea Ponies

00,02PonyNegZero, ?
04YARR HARR FIDDLEDY DE
That's working just fine
this map is weird
Being a pony is alright to be
Reminds me of SCP-087-B
00,02PonyNegZero, actually theres no wall there
00,02source engine doesnt clear the screen
needs skybox :D
Did Pinkie break the fourth wall again?
087-B is like the staircase but its a massive tunnel
00,02PonyNegZero, i made a square tube, added the missing walls just now
04o_o I do not recognize you o_o
It must be the bricks and the lack of light
00,02wonder
00,02dont think i need to close tf2 each time
04Welcome back ^_^
not realy
wikipedia
When breaking the fourth wall, you talk directly to the viewer, give them references to things in their universe that doesn't belong in yours
04:D
etc.
breaking the 4th wall is when the characters in the play/show become aware of the viewer
00,02but there should never be void visible
00,02so people tend not to care
and pinkie breakes it ?
Every time
often :D
she also breaks physics
That's why she's my favourite
^
00,02hmmm
00,02have to relaunch tf2 every time
she my fav to
04Silly users, everybody knows Applejack is best mane pony~
00,02shana, that is a good point
