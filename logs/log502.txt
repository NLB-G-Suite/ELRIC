I'll agree that getting kicked in the balls is worse than giving birth, but only because one has to consider the relative value of the activity... and giving birth has a clear biological and social value, while getting kicked... doesn't, usually.

Oh wait!
13my vision of OS's is wide and pure, inb4: don't go bahw because you cant afford it/dont like the company/plainly dont like it
For some reason, even though it was plugged in, my laptop's battery died. Would that have anything to do with it?
And my battery isn't charging...
No wait, there it goes.
00,02i like dis remix

though I think I got rid of it a long time ago. T.T
lol they dropped support for vista BEFORE they dropped support for win 98
The motherboard is Intel Mobile GL40 Express but it's hard to find the beep codes for intel laptops
I see sunlight.
maybe
Even though these are the desktop codes, they might be the same. http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-010249.htm
Just gota finnish this chapter...
Just don't get burned from the sun.
currently in use: 1,25 GB of Ram
that alright
thats*

d3rp thats why i dropped Opera :D
got the system restore turned off?
BANG!
damn, nice
Hay guyz
Win 8 is nuce
*nice
it ok i got norton :P
^
Its really just a cosmetic thing yeah
but i liek it
cuz win vista and 7 have the 'widgets'
I tried it and really didn't like it.
i use the widgets :(
the shame!
:D
W7 > xp > 98 > w8 > vista
98 shoudl be at the end
xp shoudl be numbah 1
win 95 > vista
XP> all
\
That GUI is not designed for multiple monitors (at least when I used it) and really was a pain to work with.
xp>7>98>95>
The best part, Win 95 > Mac OSX
xps time has passed but for its time it was just...wow, leaps and bounds from 98
also, song link pl0x
OH laptops suck

Everything can eventually be lead to being my fault.

YES
The entire computer crashes, specifically when watching videos and sometimes while gaming.

you can get a barebones off newegg.com for under $400
Really? meh, to each his own
Dont go barebones,
Then you're restricted to their Mobo standards
cheaper ;D
and barebones usually gives a discount on ram/MB/CPU combo
Good point,
thanks for the games guys
