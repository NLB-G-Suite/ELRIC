RAWRity sagas violence can be a part of comedy , but when we make only violence on males acceptable. we create a moral standart that males are dispensable
BOOM!
TheWhitePlague, giving birth is equivilant pain to breaking 25 bones at the same time :|
Like I've said in the past, I don't watch much television.
no person in history has both given birth and had testicles to be kicked. So we do not know for sure

KICK
LOL
or get kicked while giving birth
:|
There are endorphins that are released during childbirth that help with the pain of that... somewhat. But obviously not enough to make it non-painful for most women.
double kick
/me begins plans for attaching testicles to a pregnant woman.
Alister: Is it sexist if I find violence to the genitals on both sides hilarious and okay?
Sagas: http://www.experienceproject.com/question-answer/Which-Hurts-More:-Getting-Kicked-In-The-Testicals-Or-Giving-Birth-Why/163715

Jeez, stop kicking me already!
Speeking of giving birth... my cus had a baby!
Seriously.
oh look science!
Bronysith: I'll buy that. But I can't testify to it personally, natch.
"Violence to the Genitals" sounds like a song by a Cannibal Corpse tribute band.
Ugh. I've talked about this too much. I really don't give a toss.
It doesnt hurt more, but Delts wise it measures up more.
Is this Doom 4?
FillyFlam: its a good name for a porno song
Take in mind being kicked in the balls is quick
TheWhitePlague: You link a discussion board?
While labour takes hours.
I'm just saying that there are endorphins released... it would be even worse without them, or for people whose endorphin receptors are shot
Randomnerd: 3
Sagas: Meh, I just took the first hting on google
I'm just gonna come out and say that, while getting kicked in the coconuts is no ballpark, I think having my insides involuntarily contract and then shove a tiny person out of a 4 inch hole in my pelvis sounds more painful.
which is why most women choose to have a painkiller during the process.

/me goes to the train station
I'll agree that getting kicked in the balls is worse than giving birth, but only because one has to consider the relative value of the activity... and giving birth has a clear biological and social value, while getting kicked... doesn't, usually.
HEY, saga! I GOT A SUPRISE FOR YOU!
I never win, anyway, so we might as well go for participation.
RAWRity: Getting kicked in the balls too hard can result in fainting and having to chirurgically removing them
C'mere! http://www.gbrower.com/Audio/BNSF%20-%20Maximize.wav
Chains: yes?
Alister: Giving birth can lead to TEARING YOUR VAGINA.
also, death
>: D
RAWRity: but dont you get something out of it? a newborn child
/me backs away from the tracks as he watches the train approach from a distance
so yeah, still going with childbirth for more painful.
RAWRity: Doctors generally try prevent this
y u buffer!
Rawrity :( you still mad at me?
Bronysith: which you then have to try to raise for 18 years.
Which is more painful, being kicked in the vagina or 9 monthes after having homosexual sex?
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5abi0sscH1rw314so1_500.jpg
0-0
... wot?
Alister: and guys generally try to prevent getting kicked in the nuts.
RAWRity: right. thats why you plan on childbirth and not have sex until you are financially prepared
I wouldn't know...yet.
/me backs away from the tracks and watches Chains train go bye
/me passes saga "GOD DAMNIT :("
11,01Kidney stones are more painful than either.
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5c0clqYkm1rs7yllo1_500.jpg
I agree with Nittany_Discord
this conversation is starting to climb on the "this hurts" list.
My friends mom told him she had kidney stones
Rofl
Bronysith: not just about finances. Do you have any clue how stressful just taking care of a child is? LITERALLY EVERYTHING CAN KILL THEM.
Nittany_Discord, no.... gallstones are worse!
YOUR HOUSE CAT COULD EASILY AND HAPPILY KILL YOUR BABY WHITHOUT TRYING
RAWRity: yea. i kknow....
Im gonna say ancient chinese torture is the most painful
11,01panda: Dunno. I've had kidney stones, but not gallstones.
RAWRity: Here is how I see it. Unless she was raped. the womand had a choice wether or not if she wanted a child. When you make a choice , you have to take responsiilities. Otherwise , a violent attack breaks the principle of non-infraction
11,01And tiny stones sent me to the hospital from extreme pain.
Okay, I've got ANOTHER suprise for you, saga! http://www.hecticfilms.com/downloads/sound%20effects/Misc/6_68.WAV
Chains: yes?
http://www.blogadilla.com/2010/02/18/the-science-of-losing-your-manhood/
Nittany_Discord yeah... did you have to piss em out?
Chains: Is that a motor cycle?
brb
11,01Yes.
RAWRity: a kick in the balls is equivalent to 9000 dels which is equivalent to giving birth to 160 kids and breaking 3200 bones at the sam time
sagas: Chainsaw. http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg839/scaled.php?server=839&filename=happysaw.png&res=landing
Nittany_Discord, Owch...
11,01But mine were fragile, so they passed painlessly.
See
Alister: ...the fuck are you talking about? This isn't about how something is more fair or whatever the cock you're talking about. it's about which is more painful: a swift kick to the nuts, or SHOVING A PERSON OUT OF YOU THROUGH A HOLE THAT IS ALSO PART OF YOU
Told you kicked in the bals is 160 kids
Thats good.
cachi01: the fuck are "dels"?
Rawrity: http://www.blogadilla.com/2010/02/18/the-science-of-losing-your-manhood/
RAWRity: is a way to measure pain
Nittany_Discord, you got lucky ^-^ my dad has to piss his out and they were the size of marbles
SWITCH TOPICS FOR THE LOVE OF MOLESTIA
a del is the amount of pain necessary to cause a troll to erase one word of a posting.
cachi01: ah, so it's one of those bullshit things that people make up to sound smart. Got it.
11,01It's when they drop from your kidneys through your utera (tube btw kidney and bladder).
RAWRity: lol i think so xd
11,01PAIN!
/me drives away in Chains car as Chains chaces him running and flailing a chainsaw
RAWRity: You arent love and tolerating
RAWRity: My original topic was actually hoe society will laugh at a kick in the balls but scream in shock at a kick in the vagina
11,01Especially if those stones cut things on the way down.
how*
hello
Nittany_Discord: imagine a paper cut in your holes entrance
RAWRity: lets say 22 hrs (birth.. i know its up to 30 hrs but its up to less too so i choose mid) and 10 minutes (kick - from 1 to 20 minutes i guess) it gives us forbirth: 57x22x60x60=4514400 total amount of pain takenkick: 10x60x9000=5400000 total amount of pain taken
BLARGHRAGHURGHAGURGHAGH!
>: D
11,01Bronysith: I've had kidney stones. Enough pain.
Alister: yes, there is a double standard - violence by a woman against a man is funny, the opposite is repugnant. There are many double standards.
cachi01: that sure is a whole lot of bullshit right there.
Nittany_discord, well, then you can endure anything!
Nittany_Discord: ....owie. FUCKING OW
RAWRity: xd actally its copypasted lol :3
Nittany_Discord: Shhh
fat fuck
11,01Yeah.
11,01It is endurance
cachi01: it some copypasted bullshit then.

copypasta BS still smells as bad

ah, excellent Elton John
Sylandest, *sighs* Nevermind. :$
I think my favorite Bleach OP was Scandal (the one done during the start of the Zanpakuto Rebellion arc)
The spirit of evil finds this mood whiplash... pleasing.
Dken2021_: lol that might actually work :D
Okay, somehow a bigger deal is being made here than necessary :|
hen3ry: good song
geeky-brony: Can't tell if your trolling or your trolling :|

Lehrer stole it, like so much else :D
oh that what it's called
ok I kinda want the song
/me slides over the amount of approval coming out of him
>.>
/me dances on DeathStar head
I wouldn't really call it stealing...technically it's a parody, which is fair use.
hehehe
<.<
0,14I heard Suda 51 somewhere?
8,6I love my randomizer sometimes
Ninjazz: Yes, aproveal

Infernal Galop = Can can music
its even got a part where ya mow down zombies w/ a tractor and "Spin me right round" plays as BGM during it :D
Sylandest: mmmhmm
OtakuTom: He uses the same bit in a different song intro, where he says he had the idea "to ste- to adapt this song, to the field of mathematics"
0,14man, everyone seems to be loving dat game
13wish i knew..
13must be a tuesday
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Lollipop Chainsaw?

Sylandest: Or that misstype was more accurate than we know.
THESADPONYGUY: Okie doki loki :)
/me is bopping head to the rhythm of the song
geeky-brony: I think tomorrow :)
BRB

Sylandest, i thought his secret was smooth jazz
Om: XD
0,14what song is this?
I haven't picked up that game yet...I have it preordered, but my sleep/work schedule keeps me from picking up new games until later in the week.
THESADPONYGUY: :(
SaxyPretender, Tara strong is voicing Julliette
0,14eeyup
Has anyone heard the tune "Entry of the Gladiators" by Julius Fucik?
Of course it's popular
really getting an earthbound vibe from this
panda: its one of many secrets. Nin is a retired ninja after all
I know this song...I'm just trying to remember it...
Sylandest, you forget about jazz, my friend.
No,I mispelled that,I'm Batman!
What the heck is this song!? I like it xD
;)

Ninjazz: no, I remember the jazz! It's your strongest power
THESADPONYGUY: No, you are you
THESADPONYGUY: lies
0,14I think this is in French
Polydunami: my head won't stop bopping
Sylandest, which would explain why i always "ninja" him...
oh and for the StarSoul Mode the "Hey Ricky(or is it Micky?)" plays and in a later level a zombies dying words are "Dear god not another Katy Perry Song! what a way to DIE!" :D
geeky-brony: I think I can get her on here right now,but for like 2 seconds.BRB
THESADPONYGUY are your parents deeeeeeaaaadd!?
It was... surreal
I know it's used in an anime...but I can't remember which one...I have some 200+ anime in the database in my head XP
I like surreal :3
panda: hehehe :D
panda: No account for him being a skilled ninha
8,6olook, a song about a chicken

hey guys, what's considered the best in voice acting? the fact that you can do existing voice? or the fact that you can do your own voices?
This is an amazing discovery
I like creepy ambiences :3
^
They make me happy :>
Ninjazz: i can appreciate a good creepy song...but when im sleepy, i can get a wee bit paranoid :$
8,6VA's are better when they can consistantly do their own voices
nkl'
Polydunami, I'm more of a sinister organ man myself
Sylandest: I love creepy songs when I sleep
no
I turned off my lamp; it's dark here xD
Om: dare I ask why? :$
mane 6, CMC, a hole lined with jagged rocks, and scary ass music
Om: same here
Oh good, this song has just that
DANG IT!
I suppose imatation's are good if they can't track the original guy
Sylandest: Its soooo nice @~@
heh I really should perfect myself on voice acting, especially learning the exact pronounciation and get rid of my accent
creepy song? thats ok i didnt need to sleep tonight
i screwed up here
Om: ehehe...right...I'll just...leave you to that...:$
if not well I hope there's work in french~

Polydunami: sleep is for week ponys
Midnight_Tempest: werent the explosions eailer enough!

Midnight_Tempest: you think ALL lack of explosions are disappointing. That and not being on fire...hell are you actually Micheal Bay?

gender likes are really messed up
eeyup
males like my little pony

No sleep makes Polydunami weak. Your argument is invalid.
Ponies47: (\
StupidSexyCJ: we dunna know, looks like brohoofs over a hole of some sort tbh.

13liking bieber is kindof these days?
Sketch_Toku_Brony: that indirect reference, lol
Polydunami: sleep is the glue that holds your sanity together

MahBoi777, reports of my sanity are greatly exaggerated.
he must go to jail

Goodmorning! :)

hoi Major_Frank
Hey there Major_Frank :3

german is kinda a beuty of an accent

Hello there, Major_Frank. :)
Snip snip snap :3

Hello there, BroKnee. :)
Ello :D
German dresses are 93% more reliable, but are somehow less fun
eins zwei drei
allo Major_Frank, and it's kinda dark to be morning for me :)
halo Major_Frank
Dken2021_: honestly, I always thought it was the most angry sounding language in existence.
greetings Major_Frank ಠ_ಠ7
but the german MLP voices are incedibly unacceptable
(Insert South Park german dance joke here)
Wow geeky-brony, just....wow
Greetings
o hai Major_Frank
Ponies47: lol
CLASSICAL
I LOVE YOU
BroKnee: lol
<LobsterHime> I agree. Fascination with the moon landings was passive; it might have kindled people’s imaginations but what tangible benefit did it bring to their everyday lives? Apple’s retina display and deeper Facebook integration make the banal more interesting, and the isolated more social.
otakon I guess, but it is a nice, soft kind of anger
jajaja
Ooh, what is this song?
BroKnee lol your not gonna get by any arrows,are ya? jk
*get hit
True story. My little brother is blonder than blonde, and as a little toddler, we were on the beach in Spain. A couple young German kids, perhaps 4-5 years old, came over, and asked my brother if he wanted to play with them. First time my brother had ever heard German, he thought they were yelling at him and he started crying
russian is more angry than german otakon...
Dken2021_: well, maybe in VioletVanilla's case but she doesn't speak German around here.
the pony has fallen off already
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I sure hope i don't get any more, they hurt
this song is beautiful
lol
hen3ry: lol
Ninjazz: Now this is some smooth music.
And so God gave to the British the dominion of the seas. To Spain he gave the rule of the land. The Germans he gave reign over the clouds.
err music:$
Whats the name of this song>?
I MUST LEARN TO PLAY THIS ONE
Generals gathered in their masses Just like witches at black masses Evil minds that plot destruction Sorcerers of death's construction
feelings are bad, mmkay?>
Om, Indeed. It's rather... nice.
13alright delete account button on ubisoft! trying to hide from me are we......

otakon: just heard that from a video i watched
this song is making me feel >_<
too bad the germans are always portrayed as the antagonist in most media
MahBoi777: that is GOOD.
What is the name of this song? Plz respond
Dken2021_: Nazi's are a VERY hard thing to live down sadly....

Hearing you guys say Crepuscularity reminds me of an episode of M*A*S*H :3
bye Diglett!
Ponies47: NO
geeky-brony: :(
lol mash... i liked that show, Radar was awesome
M*A*S*H:D
Ponies47: lol jk
Never seen M*A*S*H :$
Pizza Pie. Pinkie's rarely spoken of cousin, because he HATES pastries and is ALL about the savory.
geeky-brony: :)
MahBoi777: (\
Yeah, I was thinking of the episode where Radar types up his report in a very narrative way xD
geeky-brony: /)
M*A*S*H was an old comedy TV show as well as a movie... the movie was far more serious though
I've never seen M*A*S*H. :P
either one was good
never knew there was a movie
Kencolt lol now my love for pizza wants me to be that pony :D
Midnight_Tempest: Oh, at times tyhe TV show beat the movie out on grimdark MAJOR. espefcially during the finale.
:o
"The friendly, hot sun showed his friendly, hot face over the mountains of purple majesty, as if he was salutating good morning to all."
Oh i like this one
13im off, BBL
Kencolt: oh yeah, very true... but that made the show that much better in all
me too
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1296/ :)
Is this by MicTheMicroPhone?
/me still isn't sure if he likes Tombstone's voice or not
I have most of the episodes of M*A*S*H memorised because I would always watch them with my late grandmother
Ninjazz: Its specific aplication
xxMoopyxx: I think it's LivingTombstone actually
oh ok
Ninjazz, I CANNOT stand tombstone
voice
xxMoopyxx lol i heard his Berry Punch's Druken Telegram! :D
/me doesnt like tombstone's voice
:3
heh
That.
MicTheMicrophone is more of a rapper than a straight up singer like this
:S
The only thing really I like MicTheMicroPhone is his fanfic readings. So I don't have to read the fanfic :P
he reminds me of the singer of The smashing Pumpkins
*thing I really
I actually didn't like rap before the fandom. Now I love it.
Midnight_Tempest: The original novel, you know-- MASH-- was basically, a composite of actual MASH incedents compiled from personal testimony. In other words, it was more a semi-documentary than a comedy-- the surgeons DID that stuff to keep from going totally insane.
Kencolt: eeyup
Yeah, it was the MASH 8055 in real life
11,12I love MASH :)
Like I said never seen M*A*S*H :$
o hai SuperBrony64
Ohai SuperBrony64 :)
11,12I have every season on DVD
And now you've made me think of one of my favorite episodes of The Simpsons, StupidSexyCJ (and no...not the one based off of your name, though that one's also good :P)
Me too, SuperBrony64 :3
oh hai SuperBrony64
11,12I wouldn't mind streaming the episodes if ponies wanted to watch it :3
eeyup never seen MASH
SuperBrony64: So does my grandpa
SuperBrony64: This.
That: Me to
ohai SuperBrony64
hey SuperBrony64! that'd be awesome
Kencolt: indeed... thats what made the show good, its something that anyone would have done in their situation
I'll watch it.
edrtfyguhikswerdtfvybuhmjokzsexrcftvybuhmjok
that sounds neat
Like I said never seen M*A*S*H :$
It was often a BIG problem for the brass. Most career soldiers could NOT get their heads around the simple fact that Doctors think DIFFERENT than soldiers, and that for most, ranks were an annoyance.
lol i dont watch the simpsons, I want to though, can never catch it on television when its playing
11,12But for now…I'm tired…night all ^_^

OtakuTom: ?
there's alot of good music
I mean, who knows? My death could occur earlier... but I don't want it to.
but I prefer rock
You're STILL working on this?
"good music" is a matter of opinion. For example, I could think that a specific genre is good that you don't.
geeky-brony: he means its more about personal preference
8,6I don't work as fast as Wrek :'(
really dud really
Country music is worse then Justin Beiber
Polydunami: if it happens it happens I guess
StupidSexyCJ: oh ok
AJ all the way
Eddmario, there are good country pieces.
kirzstryfe: why sad u stuff is awesome
... I can't think of one right now :S
Spriggals: nope scootaloo
03wb? LOL
red solo cup >_(\
*Georgia
just because you did that..................................waow yeah your cool dude..........................teh whatever :|
Yea, there's also always the couple of songs from each genre that stand out. For example, I don't like Country music, but there's still a couple songs (older ones, specifically) that I still like.
oh ......... noooo
Okay, name at least three Justin Bieber songs. Or at least three that you like.
Ummm Does Ghostrider or Cony count or are they trucker rock?
Awww shit
8,6justin beiber doesn't count as a genre
*Convoy
Polydunami I was saying that except for those 2 songs I named that Country music is TERRIBLE
Wait...you mean me, Poly? I've never listened to him, and he's an artist, not a genre
I mean, three GOOD Justin Bieber songs
Justin Beiber is best genre
i hate Justin Bieber dude
Polydunami: :D lololol your funny
8,6let's check the itunes here...
*explodes because Justin Beiber was said*
I'm serious geeky-brony.
/me is grinning xD

Lol:D
some country can be good
Okay...maybe 'artist' was the wrong word...he wants to be a singer...key phrase is "wants to be"
cause some of my friends hate justin bieber
wait no...
country music is good when youre wasted
That moment when a Justin Beiber cover is better than a Sheryl Crow cover...
and thats about it
question: xxMoopyxx can you spell wow right? cause everytime I've seen you type it....it comes out waow.
*explodes because Justin Beiber was said*
"I hate Justin Bieber because my friends hate Justin Bieber and I want to fit in because it's cool..."
justin bieber is a no life long neck crow
Ponies47: noooooooooooooooo
Ponies47: Justin Bieber! Haha! I know your weakness!
Peer Pressure is bad mmkay?
If you compare it to Sheryl Crow's version, Justin Beiber's cover of the Guns N Roses song "Sweet Child O' Mine" is okay
Polydunami: i dont hate jb i just haet the muisc
I don't hate Justin Bieber, actually
*explodes because Justin Beiber was said*
Boom
Ponies47: nooooooooooooooo whyyy
The only version of Sweet Child O' Mine worth listening to is the one by GNR XP
/me also doesnt hate Justin Bieber
same
*respawns*
Ponies47: yay
Do you have rolling stones
I think Justin Bieberis ugly
I'm not a big fan of country, but, unlike Bieber, there are a few things I can stand to hear from time to time.
/me is too apathetic to hate most of the time
I can explode as much as I want and never be ded! :P
Mutterguy: most
Ponies47: lol awesome
Watch
You're a bob-omb, Ponies47?
awww yeaaahhh
would you guys stop getting all mad at me dang yall you guys are in hot water hot steaming hot tub water for peake sake
Hey
*Explodes*
*respawns*
I haven't listened to Bieber, so I have no opinion either way about him. I've heard a parody or 2 of his songs. That's the closest I've been to listening to him.
mmmm

StupidPinkyCJ: it's probably for the best that u take it then
=__=
BroKnee: yay
I've actually had this username with me for over... seven years was it now? Wow time moves fast
Pink_Ponies47: having fun
CrimsonPhoenix: Mr. Roboto is also a favorite of mine...you should see the plans I have for making humanoid robots that can walk and talk freely.
7 years? holy shet
geeky-brony :3 Still feelin kinda down
BroKnee: why
Oh my OtakuTom I cannot wait to be ruled by machines
Polydunami: ha...i've been useing shamroc since i got a computer....about 14 years ago..
geeky-brony I HAVE NO IDEA Dx
I've told this story before, but I got my nickname from babel fish :s
BroKnee: oh noes
I've been using OtakuTom since I was given it back in high school some...oh...10 years ago.
how old is bronystate? O_o
Oh my
1 year?
MahBoi777: like 2 years....
geeky-brony: No so bad being pink. I mean I'm not dark blue and I don't have my golden mane or my dark red eyes but it's ok! :)
or somthing
MahBoi777, about 1 year
It's about one year
Yea, BronyState's been around for just over a year.
Shamroc: ah
Shamroc, MLP FiM is two years
ok 1 year..im derping here
Yeah
heck not even
14hello
Pink_Ponies47: i like staying gray black and read thanks
Bronystate was made before there were bronies
I first joined BronyState during the season 2 premiere.
I joined after The Last Roundup
OtakuTom, that's pretty early I believe
I joined right after MMM
It was about 4...maybe 5 months after the site started up.
when Coraline was playing
What was MMM?
I joined in October I believe
geeky-brony: Okie doki loki. *Starts jumping like Pinkie Pie* Hmm strange couldn't jump like this before
Right, babelfish.
I joined just before season 2 started
8,6MMMystery on the Friendship Express, 2nd to last episode of s2
Pink_Ponies47: i cold always jump like that
I joined in the end of january I remember that because it was my birthday
Oh yeah
What is a good website to watch mlp on besides youtube?
hello

So, I take it this will be in the Drawfriend on ED later "tonght". I say it in parenthesis because it's almost 2:30 in the morning
geeky-brony: Hmm strange. Now I feal like having a party
BroKnee Netflix if you got it
Hi Candy_Mane I'M PINK! :)
gnight Bluestrom_S
But yea...CrimsonPhoenix...you should see my ideas for humanoid robots. The only thing that's keeping me from making them now is how poor conversation AI is.
The end of January of this year was life-changing to say the least
Pink_Ponies47: thats cuz your a were-pinky
eddmario nopes :/
Well, for me, at least
Well Eddmario here it is 9:28am
first day ever on bronystate, Machete was playing
00,10I decided to make a new desktop pony, what do you all think?
Pink_Ponies47: i am pink too :)
00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/O5VlV3.jpg
Ohai Sumica

MahBoi777: what bands u like da most
Can somepony PLEASE tell me a good site to watch MLP on? besides youtube

/me dance on DeathStar head missd u
/me dances under geeky-brony s feet
DeathStar: yay
sorry i was being a troll i had to go to the garage and chilled out for a minute and came back all nice again
00,10such as still a better love story then Twilight
Ohai DeathStar. I'M PINK!
Pink_Ponies47: why are you pink?
Maybe ponified references to famous MST3K quips.
Sumica, making progress already
Apparently, ponified should be pooshoes to my spellchecker.
R.I.P Kurt Cobain
hello
I hear Nirvana.
hello pony_931736
ok im going back to my paint program i'll let you know when im done ok
Polydunami: im lising to Come as You Are by Nirvana
This is still Styx playing through the stream, Poly. I don't know what you're hearing ^^;
00,10another problem is i made them to fit my video player.
Oh my
SWEET MADAME BLUUUUUE
DeathStar: Pink_Ponies47 is a were-pinky
00,10suppose they would work with stream too
DeathStar: IDK. I just looked at picture of the man 6 I fal to the floor and en I tune pink. AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE!
I got confused there :S
*Mane fell
Pink_Ponies47: i see
*and I tuerned
00,10tell you what, Pm me any ideas you have for them to say.
DeathStar: whaer wer u
geeky-brony: i was eating dinner
DeathStar: Yeah. So now I'm pink. I really don't mind. But I just wonder how I change back?
DeathStar: DINER
Yea, depending on what program you use to stream with, you can always adjust the size of the image. I use XSplit, which allows me to put in images with transparencies, so I could use just the base image and not the Desktop Ponies app.
R.I.P Kurt Cobain.
Pink_Ponies47: try dancing it solves everything
ok so if i draw a stick figure how do idraw hat that hes wearing backwords?
Pink_Ponies47: embrace it as a new way of life. it's a part of u now

Mine's not just because I like to game, but also that I'm trying to become a game developer.
I enjoy gaming, but food iis mah true love
Hmm... I'd probably have a baseball as my cutie mark tbh
OtakuTom: Nice ^-^
Midnight_Tempest: i find them all to be interesting in their own way ^^

It's good to know that the VA of Applebloom is such a good singer! She's got a brilliant carreer ahead of her :$
Ty ty mr/miss mod
Thanks, kirzstryfe! Twas fun. :)

Om, he's a guy.
Om: Mr
Stream is down? post Humans
thanks for streaming kirzstryfe
kirzstryfe: goodnight and thanks for the music!
I never assume.
Thanks for the stream kirzstryfe ~
Pwah: A lesson I've learned is to simply not give a damn what people think and just enjoy what you enjoy. Lifes too short to care what others think of you.
FairysHuff: I'm gonna be 20 but I look like 16 or 18 lol
I only know cause I played l4d2 with him. x3
Pwah: Sounds cliche I know but it took me years to figure out it's true ^_^
FairysHuff: I hear that! :)
i feel weird
my mom made me shave my afro
Pwah: LOL I will be 32 in July and I am like 12 at heart. LOL
mario_pony: UNACCEPTABLE
:D
mario_pony: :<
i feel naked
ohai
without it
hi Jim
mario_pony: It will grow back
mario_pony: BALD!
FairysHuff: This one person at a graduation said to not let the child in our heart die when we grow older :3
ohai Jim :)
Tnx StupidSexyCarambola, Otakutom for the complements on my tile :$
Ponies47: it took me 6 months to grow it
Okay...for anyone who was interested, I found the video of me singing White and Nerdy...weird to think that this was almost 6 years ago now... http://youtu.be/QD2Y2GAVH6g
Pwah: For example I am going to buy myself a Kimono for the summer and wear it outside. I will get comments maybe even attacked but yah know what EFF people ^_^
mario_pony: :O
wow that sucks
:(
mario_pony: I wudn't have given up mah afro without a fight
OtakuTom: lol where were you?
Pwah: Thats hard to do. The child becomes more covered in jaded fatigue over the years not matter what we do.
mario_pony: I also cut my hair the other day
From really long to quite short
We were in line for the Wii launch at Meijer (the only place that was letting us stay inside because it was about -10 degrees out that day (or at least felt like it)
FairysHuff: I wish I was less self-conscious so I wouldn't be afraid to express myself :(
I haven't ahd my hair cut in a while :P
*had
Pwah: Don't get me wrong. I am very self-conscious. It's about fighting through that to do what you want rather than whats expected of you.
Pwah: It's not easy. Not at all but it makes you feel better.
gtg, later yall
See you later, StupidSexyCJ
bye
cya StupidSexyCarambola
FairysHuff: Yeah, and it doesn't help that i'm shy too :<
but since i cut my hair my mom said she would let me dye it red
Damn... forgot to say bye.

Pwah: i know how you feel
FairysHuff: I'm afraid I don't have an mlp shirt, I'm afraid of what my mom would think :(
mario_pony: it's nothing, it just leads to a stream without a chat
Pwah: Oh don't worry about that. I still avoid crowds, traffic, loud noise etc. It's more about doing what you like and ignoring others.
Pwah: Tell then you like the show for it's quality, and try to convince her to see atleast 4 eps
I wish I had some My Little Pony T-shirts. But I'm saving for a new computer right now :<
I might buy a mlp shirt tommorow :$:http://search.hottopic.com/clothing/My%20Little%20Pony
I've got a Fluttershy plush on display in my room. I know my mom's seen it. I don't know if she knows what it's from or what she thinks of it, and I don't care either way.

Nomed_Tomato_Plush: I did. Should I repeat my self?

dat top comment
Pwah: Oh you'll still be self-conscious just as I am ^_^ It's just ignoring it and doing what you want anyway. So don't try to do the impossible. You can't control your emotions.
dang! mlp shirts are expensive!
http://i.imgur.com/t9e5K.jpg Applejazz

Hai Phase4
I heard you like Terraria Phase4 ? :p
Om-oldbean, I'm not ripe yet.
oh look its Phase4
ohai Phase4
hey Phase4
AND NOW for the classic jingle of CMC
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOY69M6-f5I&feature=channel&list=UL
00,02i learned something today
Applejazz: No you werent
FairysHuff: I was thinking it wasn't a good quality for a person to have :<
Phase4: Java sucks?
00,02Vordox, already knew that
Oh wait window is good. :P
Phase4: fluttershy is best pony?
Windows*
My side hurts. :I
do you ever wonder how much closer to actual pony sex season 3 will go ? i mean , its heavily implied already.
00,02Vordox, NO :<
We already know that Phase 4 likes Windows :P
00,02mario_pony, close
Phase4: Fine I give up XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ1dYrjuYf4
00,02vhdl sucks
Pwah: I am a 32 year old social recluse who likes cute things, dislikes being social, and blah blah blah. It doesn't matter what my qualities are so long as I enjoy life.
smashing
00,02to be more precise, the guys who can do vhdl suck at explaining vhdl
Applejazz: Baby apple >.>
yay
That's why a lot of languages fail, Phase4

Applejazz, :3c
Ohai Phase4 :)
00,02OtakuTom, i imagine so, javascript has a similar problem
00,02ohai Ponies47
Pwah: Everyone is different. No point forcing yourself to be what people want you to be. You'll just make yourself miserable. Trust me. I've had 12 years to figure this out ~_~ The hard way.
Hey, Phase4!
Ah! That's the punctuation I forgot to add to my ping list...a comma!
00,02OtakuTom, javascript is actualy quite fun, when someone gets it you can see the switch betwene 'it sucks' and 'tis best script'
00,02ohai Applejazz

Pwah: 12 years of pain.... *Sigh* don't put yourself through what I did. I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
FairysHuff: you're right fairy! I should just accept my personality and for who I am! :3

^
Im depressing? D:

/me is totally ignored

mario_pony: idk :o
+Phase4: Depressing Rain is the name of my oc
Pwahy: LOL Yes ^_^ Its a very cliche lesson I know. But it is true. Now you just have to act on it. Which is the hard part ^_~
Hi Spectrum_Plush :)
Pwahy: type /nick then new nick
Rain is never depressing! I love it when it rains!
/me doesnt like being Depressing... :<
mario_pony: thanks ^^
You're not!
GAmE OVER YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA....
the actruly fuck
hey im not the one who thought up this nickname dont blame me
lol then who did
but.. its /your/ oc >_>
I need money for MLP stuff. Like shirts. But I'm saving for a new computer :<
hmm
there it is!
Once again if anyone wants to contact me directly they can message me on Crunchyroll.com under the same user name.
14o.o
14that suck
14s
FAIRY'S!
Ponies47: but ponies are more important
03that's just fricking hilarious :P
are you leaving now fairys? :o
Same user name on Steam as well
mario_pony: one of my friends made an oc and its name that matched me
oooh
you can change the name though, because it is your oc >_>
Pwah: I was thinking about it. I haven't had breakfast yet. But to be honest I don't want to. Am lonely ^_^
14is that real? o_O
hi
hi sharpshooter
mario_pony: IKR? But my computer is so slow and old. It's about 10 years old so it's better I just save now :<
03depends on the company
well mabye the name fits me well
1450 dollars for 1gb is INSANE D:
FairysHuff: I'll be here for a couple more minutes ^^
FAIRY'S!
FAIRY GODPARENTS! FAIRY GODPARENTS!
Ponies47: i know how you feel
Ponies47: Huh?
mario_pony: eeyup :<
we need some stream
nah
Hello everypony!!!
FairysHuff: Just being random AGIAN!
hi MysteryPony
I like it when there is no stream
i kinda new to this so what do we do basicly
chat :|
Hello MysteryPony! What's the mystery?
well that simple
Now just waiting for Phase4 ....hur hur hur...
14I pay 13Eur monthly for 200MB and 50 minutes of free callings and unlimited SMS with people with my same mobile service + unlimited calls with one number
om nom nom the clouds\
Pwah: Thats another thing I forgot to mention. DON'T be afraid to admit how you feel. If you feel lonely say so. If you like somone say so. Etc. Life is too short to observe social rules of others ^_^
00,02indeed
14too bad I had to undo that because I had to save money xP
Ponies47 cake!
Ponies47: FairyFluff ^_^
MysteryPony: LO
so if I feel like slapping someone, do it, FairysHuff?
anyone here remember Brony4Life?
MysteryPony: *;O
I hardly think that is a good thing
:O
FairysHuff: yeah :3
Rain: Thats an action not a feeling ^_^ lol
lawl derp
So Phase4. You gonna stream?
what is friday movie night
so if I feel like someone is ugly and they should know about it, I should tell them?
movies shown on friday night.
what movie we going to watch
Lets dance!!!
Rain: As long as your not mean about it yes. I believe in absolute honesty in everything.
sharpshooter: Usually each week end we have a Movie night, Euro is on Saturday, US is Friday, Where we show 2 movies of lottery chosen ones, and 2 eps of MLP
well that cool
screw logic
Element of Honesty!
rrrora
/me is doing the "you son of a b"¤56"
hey you should uh stream that would be uh cool
Far too many people in the word lie to others and themselves. I find honesty to be very freeing.
Depressing_Rain, who could stream?
Mhm!
/me is grinning like Twi waiting for phase4 to join Terraria so we can advance the server. :)
Rain: Charlie Sheen could
FairysHuff: i hope you dont mean that! without lies i wodent have any friends!
no he couldnt, because he is not a bronystate moderator/techie
lawl charlie sheen
its Charlie Sheen he needs no reason
Chuck Norris could stream
Charlie Sheen is had +o in his veins. That's his tiger blood type
For example I will share something with everyone here that only my friends know. I have tried to take my own life 3 times in the past. Tis a simple matter of fact I don't expect any sympathy or want any.
00,02there we go
00,02code merged
00,02reboot time
he may not need a reason, but he would still have to be a mod/techie to be allowed to stream here
WOOT
phase4 has a terraria server
Rain: stop using logic
then why tell people, FairysHuff? :|
ill join the terraria
FairysHuff: sounds rough
Rain: An example of both honesty and of not caring what others think.
Rain: dont rain on peapol parades!
:O
if you didnt want any attention for it and it was indeed a simple fact, then you could have went your entire life without telling anyone about it
mysterypony: you just ruind the mood
Alchemist: Meh, it is what it is. I'm not the only one in the world nor do I pretend to be ^_^
there was a mood?
lol
henr3ry: there was
i become to Honest when driking! so i dont drink!
Rain: Thats your perception of social rules. Not mine. Everyone is different.
all I sensed was a silly filly argument about whether Charlie Sheen would be able to stream (he totally could, unless Chuck Norris had the stream first)
FairysHuff: just because there are hundreds of thousands of people trying to do it, it wont become less rough/serious though.
03well
03going to bed
phase4 I would love to goin your tarraria if you'll have me
to be totaly honest i have never smiled
Alchemist: You mean millions ^_^
Depressing_Rain: i find that hard to believe
FairysHuff: or millions, you get my point :)
/me falls outta chat
I have some stuff about me that I dont care what people think of it, but I dont go just saying it randomly. If someone asks, sure, but if they dont, then why bring it up?
Depressing_Rain: THis looks like a job fot PINKIE PIE!!!!
Alchemist: Yes ^_^
*for
hey phase4 you shud tell me the terraria server's name
/me sighs
00,02Depressing_Rain, its Vordox's server
Wait whut?
ok
00,02now wheres that button
Oh
port?
*explodes*
FREE CAKE!!!
Rain: I was using it as an example. I could have used something else but it's something I'm still not sure of so I couldn't be entirely sure if I was being honest with it or not.
/me starts handing out cake!
Depressing_Rain: If Phase wants to play Terraria it goes up :P
Rain: exactly. That's my approach for anything "inconvenient" I like :D
can I goin your tarraria phase4
mun get.
now to figure out how to actually land safely on it...
*explodes*
/me explodes..Twice!
:O
you can't do that. It's not scientifically possible. YOU are not scientifically possible!
Im thinking of changing my nick to Zoltan or some shit, because 96% of all pings that come from here are "chocolate rain" or weather related. 3% come from other users using nicks with Rain in them, .5% come from tab fails, and .5% are actually directed at me
You're not scientifically possible!!
FairysHuff: it must be a great a feeling. Not caring what others think about you. I still want others to respect me so I have to put on a mask for them. Sort of.
Oh drat.
/me disappears in a puff of logic
i'm back!
Rain: Zoltán?
00,02oooo
00,02windows patch day
00,02thats allways fun
Alchemist: I've found that people will think what they want to think of you no matter what you do to try and please them. So why bother stressing yourself out over it? Just be yourself.
FairysHuff: are you a girl fairy?
anyway, havent slept in 3 days and have to be on a roof at 8am. Im going to atleast /try/ to get some rest
Pwahy: I wish ~_~
damn you 4:30am sneaking up so fast
FairysHuff: lawl
We are here, fixing up the windows. Patch by patch, closing all those damn security holes, adding more bloatware as it grows, I'm patching, my Windows.
Phase4: wait... windows patch????
Pwahy: Girls get to wear the most awesome clothes. I am so envious ~_~

FairysHuff: byes :3
#Dashiesauce
FairysHuff: bye
I'm still here. Just filling out the survey for the lottery :P
see yaa FairysHuff
:3
I just discovered how to get infinate sprint while sprinting backwards in Skyrim
sweet how
Ponies47: for what i am about to do TO U
btw theres seem to be a voting on EQD on which intro is better the italian one or the English extended one what do you guys think?
hhhhhmmmmmmmm
Get the sprint while blocking perk, crouch and sprint. You can sprint forever while crouched, the backwards thing was just funny and I don't know how to do that
Om-oldbean: um... what?
All done :)
/me pins Ponies47 to the ground
Ponies47: what you vote for?
/me injects a sleeping serum into Ponies47 s blood stream
mario_pony: No spoilers
Panda: I can sprint foreva in skyrim!
:|
Dovakiin!
i used the oghma infinium:D
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I'M NEEDLE PROOF! :D
Panda: Compleatly legit. Not using any cheats.
mario_pony: sorry
Om-oldbean: i know ^^ you arent the first to figure that one out :D
Om-oldbean do you use the book?
Ponies47: fine i give up
/me hands Ponies47 a soda
Panda: Can they do it backwards?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I'll go to bed soon don't worry ^_^
yay
Om-oldbean: idk, you should consult youtube for that, old bean
/me glomps Ponies47
dishwasher_ULTIMATE: I dunno what book you are talking about.
Panda: NO! I am sprinting backwards and you cant stop me!
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I'm cutting back on soda to. I only had 1 can today. ^_^
/me stops Om-oldbean from sprinting backwards
good for you
Om-oldbean The Oghma Infinium you get it after complete the quest for Septimus the carzy wizard who live in out in the ice
Om-oldbean i jump from level 48 to 62 using that book
dishwasher_ULTIMATE: Meh, gainin skilz is fun.
Panda: I am still running in place!
Suddenly... Phase4 lost his pick.
Om-oldbean: thats fine///
00,02ikr
Maybe you dropped it.
Or gave it to someone.
we have to find it
the most amazing glitch in Skyrim is the chest in Dawnstar i wonder if bethedsa plan to do it or not but its the hypest shit:D
DROP IT!
dun dun dun dun dun
:P
AHHHH LORD VADER
:O
Suddenly, Goblin seige
nothing like killing people while running backwards in a circle
CHUCK NORRIS
Om-oldbean how did you run backward again?
Chuck norris checks his closet every night for me
mario_pony: lol :D
Nothing like getting that bouty sky hight, Om-oldbean.
bounty*
high*
=__=
dont say that shit mario_pony hes watching
chuck norris carries me around for protection
dishwasher_ULTIMATE: Sprint while blocking and run in a circle in a group of enimies, and sometiemes you can sprin in a different direction
oh....
Applejazz: I ran though town froliking in the flying bodies
Om-oldbean. :D
this game looks fun
NOOOOO
It is.
It's a great game, really.
Don't let people tell you that's a Minecraft clone.
I love me some tararria
Applejazz: this looks more action-ey than Minecraft
Kinda unfail since you can stun lock them with the sheild spring, just slide them aroun on the ground
It is. Some would call it a mix between MC, Castlevania and Metroid. But I wouldn't make that comparrison.
I'M A NOODLE HEAD AND YOUR NOT! *Throws rock into he air*
*the
*catches the rock
Nice catch! :d
ikr
=/
Screw a horse I got a sheild.
Okie doki loki. I'm gonna head off to bed now. GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY! :)
oh hai Molegera
Molgera*
Night, Ponies47. Take care.
:<
See you later Ponies47!

Applejazz: I'm 50% resistant to magic while blocking ;)

Hello there, glennglog22.
Sure sounds like you drink like a viking, but do you hold your liquor like a viking too? That's what I wanna know :)
liters? who uses the metric system... really...
normal people :P
Metric FTW
I thought every country in the world uses the metric system except for the US.
kph>mph
yeh every other country is wrong
13!chatstats
Loading stats program...
Meters>yards and Celcius > Fahrenheit
I like metric better.
RoboGerbil: I live in the States, but it is harder to follow the U.S. measuring system.
13also hai all, to anyone who's here xD
metric makes more sense but if i used imperial for long enough im sure id be attached to it
05USA is the new roman empire
With bigger catapults
meh.. the only reason the us doesnt use the metric is every schematic since forever is still in imperial units
05and it was ther oman empire that caused the fall opf the roman empire
Long Live the President of the United States.
Wrek will it get conquered by the huns?
05roman*
Let's take length measurements. It makes sense that it converts 1000_=1_, but in the US, it always varies.
05but atleast you have orgies and vomitariums to look forward to
Great... =__= More fun.
Hura!
someone has seen eddie izzard
Guys, I need help
PC tech help
If the US is the new roman empire I call dibs on Sparta
i call dibs on germania
Hello there, Monfang. I don't think I can help you there, though.
Anyone here know anything about PCs specificly Laptops.
Yeah
'Laptops suck
I turned mine on this morning and was meet with one long loud beep.
Monfang just tell us the problem and we will try by the best of our abilitys
Monfang: careful what 'help' you get on PC's from the interwebs
It's dead, buy a desktop
13hai
The manual says what the beeps mean
05sounds like something essential is not connected
It was like DeeeDeeeeeDeeeeeeDeeeeDeeeeDeeeeeDeee
13insteaad of hey
13Navi should say Hai
Well I'm using it right now
weird
I left it on for a time and it eventually stopped.
1 long beep is cpu error
Monfang: could be the memory dislodged.
Monfang so its NOT aone long continous peep?
looks like 2 short 2 long?
Well I can hear where it, how should I put this, bounces up. But there is no stop to it.
13I ended up being half an hour late to my exam today LOL
Rub some bacon on it.
13I was given an extra half an hour to make up for lost time but I didn't really need it in the end
the beeps will be in patterns (sually 4 beeps in the pattern)
Too vague info, need more than that
13Sociology :P
the beep gradually gets faster you mean?
No. It stays steady.
13easy :3c
And it was more than four of the 'D' in the beep
Monfang is there anything else you noticed? (Performance drops etc.)?
Or maybe I should say 'B'
13Yeah pretty much xD
13OPINIONS OPINIONS OPINIONS HATE HATE HATE
/me runs
13;3
13also, wall of pink
13:D
I just now got it to turn on. When It first started ot happen, I did a hard shutdown.
I did notice it didn't go to a login screen.
13pink ftw :3
ok....i have no idea but i think if you havent already hit up google, look up your make and model and swearch for the symptoms you got, failing that maybe email the manufacture
13and green, electyric/light green
Have you got a manual
nope, hes got a virus.
until them.....back up as much as you can
I tried that, but mine is the only PC that is accessable and runs good.
13I'm iffy with green, I only like certain shades of it xD
13like the one that has a bit of blue in it too
A virus RoboGerbil? What gives you that idea?
.
Hi Pinkamena!
13like, lightybree-green? :3c
Monfang: lately viruses have been attaching to the boot sectors of hard drives
hi
I have Avast! so should I do a full scan?
II didnt realise
hey pony73385
13Not so much xD
pinkamena was denied name
if he has a current os that doesnt allow boot sector changes, the comp will fail to boot
Well, when the PC works normaly now, and has no performance Problems, then I think we can cross out Hardware-Problems, so yeah, something in the Software (Virus or a bad Driver) is probably the cause
Hey Lighty, Windows is great for art, programming, games and everything else too :>
Well it booted after a long time of attacking my ears.
13ahw >:
13and i know hyper :3
xchat
and for power
13games ftw~
When it got to the Window Logo, it beeped one more time.
no you didn't
you said yesterday
Look im on the stream :D
What is the model of the laptop
dat cygwin
that it wasn't for that
Emachines 825e I think
lol laptop
i have a gaming computer
Phase4 how come you have different people coming up in different colours?
same with *nix* being only for power and/or Mac being for graphics
Monfang: you said you have another pc? update the virus scanner on that, then strap the hard drive from your not working pc to your working pc and scan it
pony73385: I'm lucky to have a roof over my head and food in my belly. So shut up.
i love you too
13i didnt say "only" did i? .-.
00,02Chrysalis, makes it easier to read
13but "good for" the are all good at certain things, and worse at others
it looks liked you did
They are all Laptops and none of them are as good as mine, RoboGerbil
13your vision looks different then someone else's
eMachine E525 is the make and model?
And your vision of OSes is a bit narrow
Oh wait!
13my vision of OS's is wide and pure, inb4: don't go bahw because you cant afford it/dont like the company/plainly dont like it
For some reason, even though it was plugged in, my laptop's battery died. Would that have anything to do with it?
And my battery isn't charging...
Oh hell, It's dead isn't it?
No, but you complaining about Linux not being in stores shows that you don't know the entire story behind it lol
No wait, there it goes.
00,02i like dis remix
13i have the right to complain
thats a good indicator you may have a battery problem or the terminals are not making contact or something similar
13and i might not know 100% of everything
13but you dont either
13so
13shuddap and listen to this
I can let you buy Ubuntu 12 for 100$
[1,0You0,4Tube]: Chicken song 10 hours! | by | Length: | Views: 324.574
sounds power related at least
Monfang: when your pc is booting (right after you pres the power button) tap the f8 key repeatedly till a menu shows up
oh god ubuntu 12
Would you like to buy it
:p
So maybe I take it out, clean it and put it back in and see if that fixes it, d3rb?
> yet it is perfectly free
Except for Unity
13then i yarrharr/get it free
Bad customisation
RoboGerbil: I actually can't do anything with the keys. I tried that but as long as it beeps, nothing works. The screen is frozen at the logo and the key shortcuts.
very bad unity ;-;
I'll buy Mint 15
13first reshearch, then buy :3
if you see the logo you missed it already
like ,now
like, now*
lol
I see the Emachines logo
At the bios boot
my life is currently a fustercluck of BUSY
fml maths test tomorrow
*eMachines
take out the battery and inspect the terminals on the battery, if they are clean dont worry about cleaning, if they appear dirty give them a light cleaning but im not sure what with, to be sagfeju st use something dry like a cloth or i dunno
plane geometry, circle geometry AND linear functions
all my finals are likenext week :|
fml
thurs-fri
EW
yeah same
fml
Godo thinking d3rb
tues-fri :c
When you start up, does it say the model of the motherboard
I don't get
circle geometry
AT ALL
I hate geometrty
and linear functions
fml
mr*geometry
me niehtr
I hate geometry too
fmllllll
FIND TEH TRIANGLE IN TEH SQUARE
I can do graphs
that's easy
Then you gotta find ANGLES
unless you remove the battery regulary i would be more inclined to suspect a faulty battery though...keep in mind im just taking stabs in the dark here
No, Hat. It shows the eMachines logo with the F2 and F12 shortcuts for the bios at th ebottom.
but I hate proofs
And then MORE angles
and I HATE trigonometry
then lengths
Then proofs
and fun stuff :<
02geometry is awesome
If you're Jack Black
:P
13I don't see when you'd need that stuff in life at all unless you're going to be a mathematician
In the BIOS it might say what model it is. I'm trying to find which motherboard the laptop has so I can see what the beep code is
13I don't even know if I spelled that right LOL
13i have proof i am the son of chuck norris ya know
13there was this door that had "PULL" all over it
13i PUSHED it open
d3rb: a faulty battery wouldnt cause the computer to fail to boot, it would jhust throw a bios error saying something about system bater
02it depends AE
02there's a few majors that need it
and suddenly windows forced a restart on me :/
02that most people will never do
yeah true, still cant hurt to check the treminals even if its unlikely, its a free potential fix
13LOL exactly ;3
lol run for the hills! the windows fail is sporeading
just leave the terminals in the laptop itself Monfang
maybe the netherlands door installer visited amsterdam before he installed it
:p
02XD
i <3 my pc
rock solid
now i have sealedits fate, it will be dead in a week :D
13thats nothing
13there was a "push" and "pull"
13sign, on a automatic sideways doors
Monfang one possibility is (if your battery really isn't charging any more) is that the Beep was caused by a Hardware faulire because the battery is dead, what would explain why everyone else is still working very well
no Phase4! its a trap!
It's charging now Lil_B
Monfang than forget this idea XD
d3rb: I chose a 670 instead of a 570 for my new pc :)
muahaha...the power!
im a bit jelly
You're gonna be jelly when I buy the 2nd 670 and put it in as well
I want a new PC, probably with Ivy Bridge
they were high in netherlands while installing doors
scary europe
13no
13more like fail store
i want amd to stop sucking so hard and make some competition for intel
meh.. nothing my crossfire 5770's cant handle yet
d3rb they fucked up Bulldozer really bad :/
Hi everypony! I'm back :D
hi OtakuTom ;)
wb OtakuTom
05im just happy with my soon year old 580
05it crashes deus ex from time to time
http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2012/06/12/demotivational-posters-there-are-plenty-of-fish-in-the-sea-2/ bahaha truth just got told
05but everythign else ios stable
My current PC has 3GB DDR2 RAM and Dual Core XD
thanks for the heals there
my current system (epenis war)
There are ALOT of thinsg you should never google... ALOT!
hell yeah Lil_B , ddr22 ftw
2*
TheRandomkid321: And when you get to my age, you will have googled it all
Ok, I passed my problem onto a tech support site and I might even try contacting my uncle. He's A+ Certified and all that..........D'OH! My A+ Book! It covers what those sounds mean!
Shimmer True
google image search killed my inner child
d3rb and I'm even running Vista, sometimes I don't know why it actually runs so well XD
before we had google image we have webferret
Lil_B: The biggest malfunction on your pc is vista
lol vista...i had that for a year or so, didnt see what everyone problem was but i had a few service packs on it
though I think I got rid of it a long time ago. T.T
lol they dropped support for vista BEFORE they dropped support for win 98
The motherboard is Intel Mobile GL40 Express but it's hard to find the beep codes for intel laptops
I see sunlight.
what is the actual problem people have with Vista?
Om-oldbean is now dubbed "Killer of chats"
Om-oldbean, time to crawl into your coffin, dude. :D
it was garbage on launch Lil_B
Lil_B: it used 2 GB memory idling
05Monfang: pålease do tell if you figure out the error
Shimmer: I've been killing chats since forever
I will do Wrek
Applejazz: Its about time indeed. Getting to bright for me to be up
ok, so i have 3 Gigs of slow ram, of which 2 GB are just in use for the OS?
Lil_B: thats right
maybe
You really are a vampire pony. :$
Night, Om. Take care. :)
Even though these are the desktop codes, they might be the same. http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-010249.htm
Applejazz: I don't need sleep yet.
Lil_B: When vista came, most in my class back then chose to get it installed on their school laptops.. a few of us geeky kids chose to stick with xp, and we laughed our asses off when it took like 3 mins for those with vista just to boot
Just gota finnish this chapter...
Lil_B: bring up task manager and see how much ram is getting used atm
Just don't get burned from the sun.
Applejazz: I am wearing a pony shirt, I am invincible
Om-oldbean, lucky.
currently in use: 1,25 GB of Ram
that alright
thats*
ohai
;p
when I ran vista I saw a huge increase in performance when i slapped in 4 gb ram and turned off the page file
Hello there, Onyxia.
Shimmer I once meserued how long it takes for my PC from pressing the Start button to actuall beeing able to open the first folder: 40sec
opera you fat piece of crap resource hog....WHY ARE USING HALF A GIG OF MEMORY
d3rb: you watching the stream in opera?
d3rp thats why i dropped Opera :D
ho Onyxia ;)
streasm in one, chat in one, and about 7 tabs in another....ok kinda makes sense
Lil_B: Well it has received some updated in approx 6-7 years, of course it should be faster now :p
Lil_B: But especially when it came it was a joke
Lil_B: what os you running to get 40 sec boot?
RoboGerbil Vista... but I really have nothing on autostart, I have my PC free of any unnaccecary Applications
got the system restore turned off?
i somehow love this music part
BANG!
Windows 7 on my SSD goes through a full shutdown and restart in about 40 seconds.
damn, nice
my computer used to be fast booting, then i p[ut steam on the boot lol
Shimmer but at least Win8 will come out soon, and it will be worse, WAY WORSE than Vista has ever been...
Hay guyz
Lil_B: Hence I'm sticking with my w7 <3
oh hai dr-whooves
Win 8 is nuce
Shimmer the will make a Tutorial, on how to use the mouse in Win8, because its all programmed to use Touch...
*nice
windows 8 can go to hell from what ive seen
I like it :c
i want my pc to be a pc, not a tablet
Yea, I'm gonna avoid Windows 8, except to know enough to troubleshoot it when I get support calls at work.
d3rb integrated flash... bye security
IT WORKS ON PCS GOD DAMMIOT
it ok i got norton :P
lol theres nothing new in win 8, just a new gui
^
W8 is a smartphone OS for a pc... that can fuck off until they have perfected the technology on crappy phones
err not new ghui, modified
Its really just a cosmetic thing yeah
but i liek it
cuz win vista and 7 have the 'widgets'
I tried it and really didn't like it.
i use the widgets :(
the shame!
:D
W7 > xp > 98 > w8 > vista
98 shoudl be at the end
nope, ME
xp shoudl be numbah 1
ah hem....windows me?
win 95 > vista
XP> all
\
That GUI is not designed for multiple monitors (at least when I used it) and really was a pain to work with.
xp>7>98>95>
objection; win xp does not have direct x 11
The best part, Win 95 > Mac OSX
objection, windows xp was fucking awesome
Yea, I'd argue that W7 is slightly better than XP.
xps time has passed but for its time it was just...wow, leaps and bounds from 98
WHy are we talking about this, i came in late
also, song link pl0x
cuz somepony was having boot errors
ins Monfangs fault, he started talking about his laptop lol
OH laptops suck
:D
Everything can eventually be lead to being my fault.
i dunno why anyone would even bother with a laptop anymore
Know that feel bro
sorry Monfang :D
People always blame the time travler too
you got desktop for gaming, then tablet for surfing
:(
Descktop for ALL teh things
^
Why RoboGerbil? Because I have no job, am broke completely and can not afford to get a new Desktop.
I'm sorry that is such a problem.
RoboGerbil: Try writing a 13 page exam on your tablet in 3 hours
XD
night all :D
Cake >:D
err what? sell that POS laptop and get a new better desktop for the $400
>: D
Build your own desktop
RoboGerbil: what part of COMPLETELY BROKE don't you understand?
I
Have
No
Money
Get a job
:D
PPl buy for scrap parts
I can't.
I would never buy a Tablet, I don't even have a Smartphone XD, only a simple Mobile-Phone
Monfang: /) i can relate
keep saying 1 word, lol that kick is funny
morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
Hey sylandest
Hi, everybrony!
JHay Count

/me shuffles the chat
what calss is DAT cylestia?
/me hugs Applejazz back :)
YE
YES
/me feels shuffeld
/me shuffles
I get to try and fix my gaming desktop tomorrow. It freezes unexpectedly when doing any sort of video and even some games. I've tried different video cards and video drivers, done multiple memory tests, and I can't find anything at all that seems to be causing the problem. I'm able to use a different mobo/processor/RAM setup and have no problems whatsoever.
hai everypony!
Everypony hates pyros
Hay discord
I own a gaming pc, a smartphone and a tablet... sold my laptop a year ago
hey |Discord|
Sylandest: Oholaoa I havent sleepd yet!
hi |Discord|
hai |Discord|
Otakutom, Pirate windows, Old CD key, Backup your games and format
Hey |Discord|
Om-oldbean: :O why have you not slept yet?
Sylandest: I dunno, but its sunrise now
I have multiple legitimate Windows licenses...not the problem.
RoboGerbil: Change the tablet with a BMW and you got me!
/me hugs dr-whooves d3rb Lil_B CountDoofus and OtakuTom at the same time
Om-oldbean: have you been hitting the coffee and/or caffeine?
/me hugs |Discord| back
The problem is the new mobo/processor
|Discord|: your arms are HUGE
oh
Sylandest: None at all.
d3rb: You have no idea
Eyup, you're fucked
OtakuTom: wait what? you upgraded your cpu and now your video crashes randomly?
Any SAI users that can provide some assistance?
:D they must be 3 metres each to hug so many at once
Om-oldbean: hmm...then I have no idea, outside of you choosing to be awake from sheer force of will, lol
00,02i'ma stop soon
05noo Phase4!
00,02Wrek, you want to take over stream?
YES
The entire computer crashes, specifically when watching videos and sometimes while gaming.
00,02last round for me
Sylandest: Its not that hard, just wooooooords
Otakutom, WTF happened?
Om-oldbean: the power of words? :D
But it doesn't give any errors. The entire system locks up, and the only thing I can do when that happens is force a hard boot.
OtakuTom: get a resource monitor, watch your ram fill. you might have a damaged chip. if it freezes every time you hit a certain point youll know
Sylandest: I got tired of that sentence.
Great, now I want to go play TF2.
WTF, what the freindship
Om-oldbean: hehehe :D
What's the song?
I often get Bluescreens, and i even have found out what caused them... when my Internet connection is really low, my Wlan Driver freaks out... but I can't delete or replace it (there is no update) and if i delete it, i can't use the Internet anymore :/
Holy shit, Same computer since 2006, still kicking ass
Ouch.
dr-whooves: Hello!
Waitasec. 2470 HP?
Do you mean damaged memory, RoboGerbil? I've run multiple memory tests and it can't find any problems.
maybe its because im on it ALL the time
Lil_B: what kind of router and what kind of wireless reciever?
OtakuTom: yeh its either damaged memory or a screwed up overclock
It's not even overclocked >_>
You're fucked man, CPU's aren't cheap
This is just running it stock. I haven't had a chance to even overclock it.
Whats your MOBO
AMD or intel?
lol so ignorant, all pc's overclock now. if you have multiple cpu's on 1 chip youre overclocking weather you know or not
^
This
RoboGerbil Hama WLAN-Stick 54 MB/s, router, I don't know, its my neighbors (he knows about it, I pay for using his router, its still cheaper than buying my own Internert)
I just have multiple computers
Every fuckign PC i own, Salvaged parts
all of em
good bits?
meh,
good enough?
My favorite has 3 hard drives though
XD
Yea, I know, dr-whooves. This is all brand new hardware. It's an ASUS P9X79 using the Intel LGA 2011 socket processor.
lol
Lil_B: hmm.. not sure about that. think thats the one you lease through your internet company, and those are always crap.
I will spend 5,000 dollars for this Alienware!*1 year later*awww ot broke time to get a new one?
*yay* AMD cpus are WAAAAAAAAAY cheaper
Im gonna leave soon
Any SAI users that can offer some assistance?
RoboGerbil My connection is reall Strange: router ->repeater(in my house)->WLAN-Stick->8 meters of USB-Cable->my PC
lol discord, alienware is dell, its chinese garbage. its just the XPS with a case mod
^this
Build your won, cheaper and So much more fun
^
RoboGerbil: The 5,000 dollar ones suck ass
I've used AMD cpu's before and wasn't really that fond of them.
you can get a barebones off newegg.com for under $400
Really? meh, to each his own
Dont go barebones,
Then you're restricted to their Mobo standards
barebones lets you upgrade to your favorite parts
60-80$ case leaves you 300 for a mobo of your choice
cheaper ;D
and barebones usually gives a discount on ram/MB/CPU combo
Good point,
also you know they will work and fit together without research
I was gonna build a PC but poorfag haz no job :(
thanks for the games guys
but dr-whooves a good case should get a minimum of 5 years out of it
So salvaged parts it is ;D
poof stream gon!
My new PC will be entirely new, but from then on I will just upgrate it from time to time and will use my old PC to learn how to build a PC on your own :)
Any case can do that long if you taker care of it
00,02Wrek, streams free
Lil_B: word of advice, if you build a gaming pc, dont skimp on the case to save a few bucks
i guess it depends on how big the graphics cards and such you plan to use will be
same factory default cas for 6 years running, several Hard drive, Ram and Graphics cards updates
But all entry level crap
:(
RoboGerbil I will probably get 3 120fans to get proper cooling
RoboGerbil it WILL be a gaming PC
My first graphics card came out of a 9win 98 PC XD
entry to mid level any case will last forever but high end is where you should consider a bigger better case
^this
I usually look for the air intake vent right by the video card in the side
Me, MOAR HARD DRIVE SLOTS
lol dr-whooves just get a full tower
use all the drive bays!
server case
4' tall
I dont have room or money for that
...nah, just make those internals hdd;s external
I may come back someone when i finally decide it
Nope, internal, keep it purty
eeew external HDD's are usually crappy usb tho... so slow
^thisd
does some here has a Rasberry Pi?
....weld two cases together, one with mobo cpu etc, the other hard drives....full of hard drvies :S
^
Methinks me needs a job :c
Yea...the reviews on Newegg for my mobo are not that good >_>
lol why bother weld? just drill screw holes in the MB side and mount the drives right to the side
Otakutom, you have a compusa near you?
i need a second job for all my hobies :D
maybe even a third
i need a first :(
theyre over ratted and life sapping
ALL teh fluttershys :( :( :( :(
rated*
Maybe I'll try finding a better mobo...I only got this one 'cause it was able to use PCI-E 16x/16x for SLI.
i see no difference in 8x vs 16x
Any CompUSA's near you?
They have great prices,
There might be, but there's also a Micro Center and a Fry's.
O.o i take it those are small buisnises
*Buisnesses
Ello there.
I'ma try and take a nap. Hopefully I won't miss the whole day.
Hay Malavolent
hey Malavolent
howdy, Malavolent
Bai oldbean
you heading off, Om-oldbean?
hai Malavolent
Both are actually nationwide chains, but they're not everywhere.
hi Malavolent :D
meh, newegg sells parts for about a buck over wholesale, and they deliver right to your door
Yeah, i'ma sleep for a bit
laters guys
Not in miami :/
take care, Om-oldbean :)
take it easy Om-oldbean
Here if you dont have 6 fans your PC will overheat from booting up XD
so...That nap lasted 4 hours o.o
lol dr-whooves you living on the sun?
Miami :/
In the summer
And i hate the beach >:/
I like summer. It's my favourite day of the year.
so what you think about all that voting stuff in florida?
I love my case. 5 fans, all 80mm or larger, and it still runs incredibly quiet.

unless your case can light your entire room its not cool enough
lol i hate leds, mine has case fan leds
dr-whooves maybe after Steam comes out on Linux i will be one :D
I use it as a pseudo night light...haha
Does Bronystae haz an app?

Oh mai Wrek is playing Tf2 D:
More for the fact that I need light to make sure I don't kill myself while walking through my room XD
I wanna be able to chat from my bed :3

I'm on my laptop right now (which is how I'm able to watch the stream)
Too poor
12LOL
irc client on your phone?

Well, there are irc apps, so you could connect to the chat from that
12our examination consisted of them facing away from the door
12and staring at a wall

shoulda gone android
I want an android
free updates

But this is an ipod, got it when my MP3 player broke
you just need an irc client and the know how on how to use it and BAMM, bronystate EVERYwhere..chat only
I need to get a new laptop, too...this one's about 4 years old now and is starting to show its age. I'm barely able to run Skyrim on the thing, and Diablo III is pretty much unplayable.
No crack for diablo 3
:( sadface
diablo 3 just opened its money store
13well the doors are at the back of the room
how exciting
13didn't stop people turning around though xD
12LOL

and now the only thing left in the gold auction is 20 mil+
12we were not allowed to turn around
12we had some crazy examiners
Yea, everyone thinks they're gonna make a living off of selling stuff on D3 >_>
i gotta check that ouit
but if you were smart youd sell all your loot in the gold auction then sell the gold for money
13I wish ours were like that LOL
ah
13I just did my best to avoid eye contact with anyone xD
That snaps it >:c
Yea, I'd rather sell my items for gold and sell the gold for money.
12at least it's all over now

13Yus :3
13last one next Tuesday
Wrek goes AFK!
good luck dude
its gotta be doable rite?
This is the internet after all
I'd only sell it once I had a decent amount...wait for the market to settle before actually starting to sell any of it.
its moar than just EHRMAHGERD CATZ

Any SAI users that can offer some assistance? Can't for the life of me figure something out...
not me, that thing is scary
okay >.> How about linux
i can sorta kinda almost use photsop....does that help :P ??
shop*
With osx being what it is and m$ digging a hole with win8, linux looks better eand better
but but but, no games :(
yeah, that's the stickler
have 2 os, win 7 and linux
Correction, no Big name games
Win XP, 8 And linux mint all on 1 pc XD
feel like a pro >:)
figure out how to get bronystate on a nes and you are set for life
O.o
I haz an nes, not doable
Maybe. I'm trying to figure out how to select an area and drag it, to extend whatever's underneath
my nesis not here :c
not with that attitude
Challenge accepted :D
but im not smart enough
the snes is thogh :D... but no tov >_>
I ain hack savvy

mechanical keyboard?
To bad no nes games on SNES
Is it a chiclet keyboard? those things suck
Swedish? Ponies on screen? Must be Wrek streaming.

Chiclet or standard?

Kind of tired
google is your friend for that Dr-Whooves
Correction, how do I TF2 linux?
or is it a nocando?
Phase4 might help you, im sure he would love another linux convert
00,02: D
00,02Dr-Whooves, install wine
yay :d
oh
00,02better yet, winetricks
00,02what distro are you running?
linux mint
so is this u phase
Hmm...maybe I'll put Linux on this machine once I get a new laptop.
I need to get into linux some more for when i get my hands on a raspberry
One of my structures on Minecraft got griefed sometime within the past month since I last visited it. As much as I would love to go on a mad killing spree, though, PvP is disabled on the server :<
wrek i see ur oc on the stream
thats wrek's OC?
its so cool
:o
;)
got it gonna try to install winetricks, if im not back in 10 min its cuz my pc blew up
Dr-Whooves: good luck!
00,02Dr-Whooves, i'm googling it now, you know what a package manager is?
best of luck Dr-Whooves
lol i ....
kinda, it lets you install packages amirite?
00,02yep
00,02seems to be called 'software manager' on mint
mhmm
00,02open it, search for wine
*yay* somepony is helping me :) and i did
00,02it'll automaticaly install both wine and all its dependencies, and will update itself
Is that you, Wrek, next to Twi?
mkay, now what
00,02Dr-Whooves, its installed?
Applejazz: yep, thats his oc
:D Celestia Wrek!
Hmmm. Nice.
actually, already installed before im stuck on what to do with it
also, whats Ctrl alt Del on linux?
00,02Dr-Whooves, try this http://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/winetricks
00,02by default nothing iirc, depends on the distro
mkay
O.O
00,02you can configure it to insta-reboot too
00,02though probably a bad idea
Well i fucked somthign up

d3rb why do my Proxy settings in IE9 have something to do with Steam... i can't see sense here :/
uhhh.....cause ie9 sucks? i have no idea
lol weird
cant wait for zombieland heard its funny :)
00,02fun fact: there was a patch distributed today to fix a bug in ie9
00,02the bug meens just visiting a site is enough to install software
did it delete ie9 and replace it with a wet trout
that would help
00,02theres about one bug like that found per week
what out of the 9000
00,02theres allso this kinda bug which they never bother to fix: http://crashie8.com/
:D
00,02that page cannot be rendered by any version of ie except the very latest beta i think
see that they put alot of codinfg
00,02but i managed to crash that trying to get to the page
silly site thinks im using a good browser
haha:D
chrome is mine
i like opera but i know it isnt good
you

big peadges
better than explorer
thats a given though
wet trout>ie9
rotary dial phone>ie9
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5244/

00,02operas not that bad
00,02its just a hipster browser
ive heard people say that before but how is it hipster?
00,02no one uses it
00,02theres no point
lol
yeah cool if they made a browser through ubutinu software
im so alternative
Good morning everypony!! :)

BF3 could have been way better.
CCCP: thanks for the new desktop :D
I should start playing TF2 sometime...I've had it for a few years now and never touched it >_>
god ;; but the reason they were in the garage is cos my PS2 is pretty much bust.
Panda-: :$
Panda-: just think of it as they're...er...giving a really really strong hug? :$
SIth Pony? Is that a thing? Must see ^_^
so one day Im gonna get a PS2 slim and rebuy my favourite ps2 games
there are so many big MLP games that are getting made... Kart Racing, Fighting, Realtime Strategy, and 2 MMOs
CCCP: What Panda- said.
Ninjazz: :D
Ninjazz: hehe :D
:3
and tf2 stands for..? (sorry if a sould like a noob) and LOL PISSMAN
BEST PONY = http://derpy.me/jcuPm
urgh sonic heroes PS2 x.x
that game was evil
CCCP: D: vlc pony?
CCCP: haha! :D
VLColt?
i would pay for the MLP fighting is magic
lol
:)
rocketbrony4221 Team Fortress 2
Michael: i will too! im gonna donate
BRB EVERYPONY

2I still somehow have my old original PS2 that still works
thanks for the intell
yup Panda-
btw
:D
Cya soon, Panda-.
I'd like to see an X-COM style turn based strategy MLP game.
bye Panda-
OMG twilight gone crazy
bye Panda-
mine just fizzled out, pretty much
luna!
my new desktop backround says: im gonna tolerate and love the SHIT outta you
oh bye Panda-
Michael me too, it looks (and sounds) georgius, and they are really fockust on balanced, yet unique characters
CCCP: Wow, hahahaha:D
:#
I'm hoping to make a couple MLP flash games if I can learn how to program in flash...lol
:3*
sup Lil_B
rocketbrony4221: nice
Cone Head is offically best pony, thanks to CCCP for confirming such.
Just some quick easy puzzle games...like a Bejeweled clone using the elements of harmony or a Yoshi's Cookie clone using cutie marks.
LoyalDash: :D *feels proud*
sh*t kids say on MW3: most common phrase: GAY!!!
poor twili
XD
For once, I agree with LoyalDash... the stars must have aligned for this one. p__p
rocketbrony4221: orly?
What to say when kids say GAY!! on a game. Say back "Yeh? And? Your point is?" ^_^
Ninjazz: hehehe :D
FairysHuff: that works some of the time, lol
yeah orly :3
FairysHuff: good point
/me giggles
06silly ponies~
gay is not an insult :(
VioletVanilla: its what we do best
/me is silly? :S
Michael: Exactly
it means happy in my books
Ninjazz: They haven't, I'm just dat awesome.:3
I really don't play online...at least not with strangers.
i do
OtakuTom: I barely play online at all anymore. Just so many asshats online.
well gay is a completely overused word and one of the reason i wanna sell my MW3 is because people say it too much on there...yeesh
but i never talk to them
LoyalDash: Pfffft. :D
Ninjazz: You know that is true.:D
i hate people who uses homofobic words to insult :[
wat
o.o
I would like to find someone to play NWN1 for a bit.
*reason's
LoyalDash: Whatever. :3
Michael: true
Yea. It's tough even going into random battlegrounds on World of Warcraft. You make a single mistake and the rest of the team berates you for the rest of the match.
Michael: i dont hate people who do it, I just hate it when people DO IT
its mean
and pointless
I hate how its become so common in normal speak nowadays :\
^
best thing to say to homophibic persons "What? You never sucked a dick before? Are you gay?" it will so screw with their heads#
you know at the end of the day it is just a word nothing else
sup
Something different than what im used too!?!? Obviously gay..... =_(\
Just remember that people who use GAY as an insult are just stupid. Ignore them and mute them in game.
RaveBrony: but of course, lol. Because thats how everything seems to work these days :D
well said huff.well said. words to live by
I can't buy the new Potato Sack on steam because i bought the old one already last year :/
Sylandest: Eeeyup, lol
BRB
FairysHuff: exactly
Let's not discuss this topic...
Im glad my friend came out of the closet, or i wouldve NEVER been this way.... I was THE most Homophobic person you would EVER meet!! :D
FairysHuff: this is how to kill these hates
yeah im with Ninjazz
I already have the games from the potato sack that I want.
I remember I joined a PUBLIC LFD2 game once. I was in there for like 30 seconds and got kicked out for no reason. I no longer play online ^_^
i'm starting to wub this serv

I'm renting a server in the next few days to set up as a Bronystate server.
05there already is a BS MC server
05its just not opened yet

05cause im lazy
05same with TF2
then it was hacked
05need to set up the dedicated server
rocketbrony4221: i have the ip if u want

Wrek! I've been talking about setting up a server for a few days now, how come nobody told me you were already setting one up?
LAN server or online server

brb, trying stuff out in LMMS, ping me if something happens (like MC, death or VioletVanilla starts streaming music)
I don't. I thought I heard it over the TF2 chat.
lol
And thought it was amusing.
FillyFlam: He said he hates Spies.
Oh.
Well, that's a given, everyone does. Except for the people who play them.
gotta remember them what created internet
Or maybe, including the people who play them.
I hate magic goblins with their damnable crawling in my ass and stuff.

play.eclipsecraft.net
demoknight has failed
I want that sword!! How do you get it??? D:
