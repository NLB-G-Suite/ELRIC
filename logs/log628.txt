I hope NCS uploads the final part of SoTC soon. I LOVE that game.
METAL I WON
I'm saying it right now: Touhou has the best music.
cachi01|phone: i can go hours
WindWhistler indeed it does
don't mension it spoilers
It also probably has the largest amount of fan arranges.
Oh yeah touhou has amazing soundtrack
superretroworld i love nintendocaprisun
<3 bad apple
You piece of (squee) computer! You are just trying to troll with me as much as you can right before I put you outta your pain! :[
WindWhistler: But which tohou is best tohou?
AJIsAwesome: give him some time, you know, IN THE BATHROOM
Unnr: That's easy. Mima.
I like watching Pokecapn
Nein
dynamo2814: ikr, i actually like him better then chugga
The one ZUN keeps forgetting to bring back
Lotus land story is est touhoi
Best*
DARN IT ZUN WHY WON'T YOU BRING MIMA-SAMA BACK
And that's why I hate Soga.
WindWhistler: I was thinking more of game
my fav is protonjon
superretroworld: FINALLY, I met someone who likes NCS more thaan Chuggaa.:|
Unnr: Oh. I like UFO
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Your Non-Pony Loving Friend Gives You One Shot...
Nue is best Extra boss
He hardly ever uploads videos...
I thought you said it happened thrice?
WindWhistler: I still really like PCB
Stop that
0,14mfw Touhou
Unnr: Hisoutensoku has the best staff roll theme
Unnr: Best Touhou is Imperishable Night. Hahaha
I like Chugga, but not as much as NCS. He's casually and tends to go on rants, but that's what I love about his videos.
AJIsAwesome: but protonjohn comes really close
Well then, if I don't see you earlier, I'll be back here at 22:50 (UTC-5), but for now I'm going to bed. night!
SaxyPretender: http://cheezburger.com/6536020992
Water Wraith, that is all
Imperishable Night is awesome because Border Team is COMPLETELY OVERPOWERED.
No, that was just a scenario
just for the heck of it, i want to try something just to see hgow far we can take it so bear with me
isn't that wrek's pic on EQD?
Okay
If it DOES happen thrice, then yes.
in case it does happen
Reikim: Aren't they always?

Wow
He's different from most LP'ers because of that.

WindWhistler: ReimuA 4 lyfe
SuperBrony64?
Yeah
Um
Awkward.
Yes it is Congrats Wrek :)
AJIsAwesome: i also love listening to ncs stories
Reikim: I prefer Marisa A or Sanae B in UFO
Are we talking about let's players?
0,14it would make sense that Reikim would use Raymoo :3
00,10yes it is wreks picture
In fact...I completed Extra three times using Sanae B
Game you and me in the back alley

Actually, Marisa is just awesome
Oh, that.

Well.

I can't go on EQD it freezes mah computer up :<
She'll break into your house while announcing her presence

otakon1: still having trouble with the lighting?
Then
..........
If you want to go extreme
Well there goes the Touhou discussion...
time to add RAY to everyone's names.
SpadeMagnes[R: I like him because Chuggaa is a bit too high strung for my tastes.
AJIsAwesome: oh, but didnt tim say he loved her in an interview?
Dismantle the damn thing, take out the hard drive, run it by a couple strong electromagnets, and than smash it.
13all we want to do is eat your brains
well im just dissapointed, i type the lyrics to still alive off of portal and everypony starts typing the rest
My mom doesn't take me to the doctor ever
I don
superretroworld: no not lightning, my USB wifi adpater borks out sometimes
13we're not unreasonable, i mean no one's going to eat your eyes
I like Chuggaa but he can be a bit...excentric sometimes
I don't have any magnets
Shizuka: but the BRAINS!
superretroworld: I'm not sure.... do you know where this video is?

Skip that step then.

WindWhistler: what's with all the rays?
CiRAYno
Someone's playing as the demoman!:O
otakon1: I dunno. I found it funny
Oh
background ponies somehow got from underrated to overrated
He's making fun of the Raymoo thing.
Reikim: I'M A GIRL
any of the mods do you know where therainbowdash or crazycherry have gone they dissappeared
/me slaps Reikim
Reimu is pronounced Raymoo, for those wondering.

Oh look after so long Past Sins is once again in the top slot in Fimfiction's featured box
LoGaN can't you get him/her off?
awww, games full
*cough*Carls Jr FTW*cough*
but hES SOO CUte i couldnt doiu thatght
nope
woah, shizu has 99 points
SpadeMagnes[R: It's funny how so many fics will get featured if it involves shipping, grimdark, or sad.
cachi01|phone: i dont even got that
never been to carls JR.
Ruby Tuesday's FTW
SpadeMagnes[R: I honestly think we need more normal fics.
I accidentaly read this one seapony fic that was fucking dark
aww man, I just realized this awesome restaurant I went once as a kid only has three locations
shizu stream?
awww
superretroworld carls jr is a fast food restaurant
I've only read 2 fics but then i've only been watching the show for about 2 weeks
wirisme1989 - which 2?
ik
FTW=for the win
first one was the one where pinkie and flutter were changelings in the bar... can't remember the name
I'm not even sure I want to read fanfics.
the 2nd was MLD
MLD :/
No matter how many dark fics I read I never seem to be bothered by them
13anyone recognize the music
Shizuka i've heard it before
has anyone read "the powers of harmony"? its really good
Shizuka: Is it from Doom?
13map 31 doom 2
13now this isn't
ive never read a fic and ive been watchINGSSD SINCE APRRRIL
I kinda wished MLD was a bit longer
LoGaN: Watch the caps, dude.
Behold ZE CAPS
The only one I was slightly disturbed by was Cheerlie's Garden
LoGaN cat?
Can anyone recommend some good normal fics? No shipping, sad, or grimdark.
AJIsAwesome: sorry my caT IS RUBBING my hands whiLE I TYPE
And I don't have any intention of reading... THAT fic
What's MLD stand for?
you know which
SpadeMagness whats it about?
WindWhistler - My Little Dashie
AJIsAwesome: White bos.
box
wirisme1989 ah, understood
i was highly disturbed by scootaloos diares, nut yet i still read the whole thing
cachi01|phone: Mind if I give you a summary?
Reikim: What genre?
Spade please
AJIsAwesome: Hm. Normal.
AJIsAwesome: the powers of harmony or smoke and mirrors
what is it?
Ìû
EVERYONE should read White Box.
Reikim: Is it sad?
0,14...what song is this?
AJIsAwesome: Not in my opinion.
cachi01|phone: Cheerlie goes nuts and kills all her students and then it goes into saw territory and she killed 5 of the elements of harmony and then twilight is blamed for the incident and she suicides, and it ends with Celestia possibly turning into Nightmare Sol
if you havnt already you should definitely read my little dashie
It's hard to explain...
SpadeMagnes[R: :S
It is... sad
So yea it...unique...
open firefox and in a new tab go to about:robots
*twitch* I cannot stand My Little Dashie
to say the least
SpadeMagnes[R NIGHTMARE SOL XDDD
Unnr - ?
why not
/me Returns from shower
WHY DOes my cat alWAYS RUB THE CAPS lock key?
Well I cant think of a better name of the equivilent of that for Celestia
because it hasn't discovered shift yet
Robots have shiny metal posteriors which should not be bitten.
Its poorly structured wish fufillment that is extremely creepy once you think about it
I don't read those kinds of fics. It ruins the image of the character, IMO.
SpadeMagnes[R: Solar Mare?
I don't think it has to ruin anything
SpadeMagnes its funny cause sol is spanish for sun :I
LoGaN: it has a fettish
as long as you remember it's just a fic
TF2?
wirisme1989: Even that doesn't help.
lbelmore8: HAHAHa nice onE
Fortress FOREVER!!
Was an interesting mod
To bad it came out at the same time as TF2, no one noticed it.
Hey, does anyone want a spot on the TF2 game?
this is TF2 right?
13sb does
i'll join if you got a slot
Sweet. Here ya go, SuperBrony64. You can have my slot.
I'm not like most people who can look at a grimdark fic like Cupcakes and still look and the character the same again. I don't know why.
Think about it, in My Little Dashie, Dash spends several *years* locked up and forced to stay inside most of the time with only one person as their entire social support structure
that is just... *creepy*
I do not know this game at all, should I feel bad about myself?
I liek cupcakes
I REALly hope i dont GET BANNED FOR HAving too many caPS OR I WOULD REally! hurt my CAT
Its funny IMO
wirisme1989: No.
wirisme1989 nah, heck, I don't know myself
LoGaN: Then move your cat.
Watching best pony killing worst pony
Anyway.
White Box. Best fic ever.
AJIsAwesome: but heS SOOo cute i cant DO THAT TO MAx
Dat weapon swithch
Reikim: That's what they said about Past SIns.:S
I must be messed up if I read several grimdark fics and have not been bothered by them
switch*
IMO best fic is Rainbow factory
Shizuka, bug me if a spot becomes avaliable
AJIsAwesome - indeed, and here it comes in book form
Spade lol same here
has RAWRity been on yet?
AJIsAwesome: I will link you White Box. It's...not sad. It's different depending on what you make of it. (Also it's better than Past Sins)
Like now, Phase4?
Because I just left.
AJIsAwesome: I also didn't care for Past Sins
Hmm, I'm iffy on grimdark fanfiction after the whole cupcakes craze :S
XD
yeah, i decided to see who was still in and it joined me instead
Polydunami - just realize that cupcakes is a "different" kind of grimdark
THATS IT IM MOving my cat
It's like I said, I'm not like most people who can look at a fic and still look and the character the same again. I don't know why.
13sb wants to join, dunno if he will
will take a sec to load
13SuperBrony64: coming?
*at*
that was grimdark for the purpose of being disturbing
i'll leave so sb can join, after the damned thing loads anyway
0,14what song is this, Shizuka?
I admit I had to keep reminding myself 'it's not canon' while reading
That's why I suggested normal fics.
should i get some keys in tf2?
13Blue Man Group - What is Rock
AJIsAwesome: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXZO8KZBziEIEXVW_h5VZtwn41M3yE0_9MX4g9Fjeac/edit?pli=1

this is blue man group? but it has LYRICS!
wirisme1989: But that's YOU, not ME.
0,14thankee
Shizuka: i think phase might be
is SuperBrony64 even here?
AJIsAwesome: The story is...itself. I cannot say that it is sad or not, because it depends on how you interpret it. But it is incredibly well-written, and I believe it should be a standard against which fics should be judged.
AJIsAwesome: As a bonus, it only involves the Mane6 tangentially.

Holy shit. Dafuq thunder
Game is loading the server now...
SB playing TF2 this will be interesting :P
There's a fimfiction version?
I swear, if there's one game I own that has the most problems just getting into an online game and playing, it's Team Fortress 2 :/
otakon y u downgrade ur firmware
Bah, if it doesn't have the colours, it's not the same.
Never played this game mode before
....
But seriously, this fic speaks to me.
I honestly don't have much of a clue on how to play this game at all really
SuperBrony64 - ever played COD zombies?
Probably it's the art stuff, which for some weird reason I understand.
Yeah
then you can play thix
MirrorImage: He's played with me :D
it's roughly the same, but they have a bomb
/me hugs SuperBrony64

It's a chest pain that happens because someone needs to steth me, usually it doesn't matter who does it, but sometimes it gets picky, I know it makes no sense but that's how it works
Meh. Canterlot Gardens looks 20% cooler

SuperBrony64, naturally. I guess this is our first chance to hear the English dubbing to the game. (There is a lot of voice acting in PSO2)
11,02What's PSO2 again?
I'm pretty sure it's Mike that has to hear my heart for the pain to stop
13canary can spam because wub

I'm trying to accustom myself to Guild Wars 2.
0,14>tapping two spoons together
yeah, I'll get you an invite when I get on, since tf2 isn't playing nice
0,14>soundgarden was featured earlier
0,14...Spoonman?

Shizuka: http://derpiboo.ru/86825

13OH GOD SCIENTOLOGY PARODY

Shit it's patching again.

0,14so I guess you could say, TF2...
"Where's my other sock?"
oh lawd
/me puts on flight goggles
wasn't expecting that
<2>+P ?
no seriously, where is it?
0,14isn't being a Team player
I'm missing a sock
BOOOOOOOOO
IRL
Under the bed!
sock location is a genuine philosophical mystery
http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=150882695999
I should go searching for the religion that finds my other sock
hey Phase4 i would like to call the next open spot...if thats cool
and yes thats real..
and now we'll show you how to deliver
/me tosses a tomato
Baby pyro
if there is someone in this world that is not missing a sock, show me your ways!
It's launch week, patches galore.
/me revokes SaxyPretender's shade privileges
win!
0,14awww
0,14;__;
hotfixes ahoy.
2.5g lol
Why...
Incidentally, do you lot know why we throw tomatos, anyway?
Klumzeedragon my bed is 3 feet above the ground. If it were there, I would see it
/me aside from fun
0,14Nope
check out the pictures
you'll see updates at least once a week usually after the first week or two
Hum...
those dishes are cool
It's supposed to give you death, that's why.
yeha ive heard of this
adding new stuff, events, random stuff
Under all the other stuff in the sock drawer?
0,14Pretty sweet, huh
So when someone throws a tomato at you, it's because they want you to die.
haha
I've emptied it out
twice
today
oh god high school :(
pretty coo'
Cheery.
There is your fun fact for the day.
and people are actually listening to you... *violin music*
once to sort out unmatching socks, and second to find that damn sock
Anyway, it stems from the Shakespearian era of theatre.
Ah... Then you're suffering from DSD.
Back then, nobody ate tomatos. Why? Ever seen a rotting tomato?
whats dsd?
0,14...I'm hungry now
They thought tomatos were death-fruit. So, if there was an actor on stage that they didn't like, they'd throw a tomato at them.
Bill Nye? F*squee*K SLEEP
DSD?
Disappearing Sock Disorder.
It's like getting death threats, only it involves squishy fruit.
I can't do that!
When is Bronystate going to have an inner-eyelid app, where you can watch the stream while you sleep
13and then bill nye predicted mythbusters
Mythbusters proven :3
Yep
Farmers didn't grow tomatos to eat; they grew them to sell at the theatre.
So. High school Spirit week is early on in the year this year and on Thursday you get to dress up as your favorite TV show character (Oh God you can only think what I'm thinking :P)
When you're willing to install a screen inside your eyelid
ahhhhh
and give it an internet connection
he killed pyro
And now you know that Shakespearian audiences weren't much crueller or stupider than audiences today.
for science
and this is why nobody took the ferengi seriously
0,14hahahahaha
oh no more singing
/me tosses a tomato at SaxyPretender
dat I will Survive parody :3
oh there he is :D
That's actually kinda funny.
0,14ooh, free food
wait... did it just reference the wave-particle theory of light?
he doesn't sound happy though
0,14...DAT DANCING
that aint half bad, and she looks good
Pyro is going nuts lol
I'm back.......my hooves hurt like hell
my figurately speaking feet*
pyro get ur flame thrower
Dark92Enigma: Find someone to give you a hoof massage? And welcome back.

i used to janitor a few boards
Charie_The_Bronco, SO YOU'RE one of these pricks that deletes all the fun
05-.(\
dunno, I haven't seen that much trolling and disorder here so far.
05Alchemist: casue we're hardasses

05and we grow with only a few people at a time

Pretty much discord here, though:P
first mann up mode complete
lol not me
Wrek true, but given that we are members of a particular fandom, its surprising how only a few trolls find this site
CrimsonPhoenix: founders would be one Hipster_Brony and NewDCD, hosties is current administrative lead
i used to janitor /v/ /fa/ /fot/ /x/
*Ghosties
i had to stop beacuse i had no time to do it anymore

Shouldn't it be 6 Million Pund Queen?
*Pound
well the queen would cost more than that to make sure she doesn't kill us
05its for the crowd
My sister didn't give me half as crap about being a brony as I thought she would. But there is still one more family member... the father.
ah right
I never felt I needed to "come out" to anyone. For me it would be like coming out as House fan. the fact I watch mlp doesnt change anything about me.
^smae thing here
*same
05"comign out as a brony" you make it sound like you're admitting murder or something

Of course there's a pony version of death. They proved in the show that ponies have funerals
MadSurge: ...I hope he's like Discworld Death
When?
Gold_Demoma When?
During the "Perfect Stallion" number
"This one's too old"
SirGanjalf: a pony skeleton :D

05Phase4: not really. I gained darkmatter by expeditiosn and their "watch this add gain X ammount" thing
Vivix: That sounds right :D
I was once linked to a clop pic. I didnt sleep for a week... I can no longer see flttershy the same way...

/me hugs TheRandomkid321
It's over now...
Hehe, let's remember, never link clop to noncloppers
It's not fair to do so-
Wrek, are you and Sumica in an aliance?

/me looks outside
TheRandomkid321: DEATH pony passed by :D
hehehe
I think their brains just weren't able to handle Eddie Izzard's logic...
05ooo i finally get to use my caps
Once all the ads where about asians who will pursue you know they are fake softcore porn pics
you know
I've been getting raunchier and raunchier ads from Mips.tv, I wonder what company they use
/me grabs his crowbar; just in case
Vivix, mips is just trying to hook you up.
I've gotten "fuckfriend" and.. "horny girls" ads and all sorts a weird-
Vivix brazzers?
not sure- they do not use google adsense at least
Jmo, :__; I don wan a
Vivix: you too? o__O
I don't even like speaking of this when wrek is watching...
aww I know you just want me Vivix <3
hehehe
I was snooping around mips site, didn't find anything about it there. It's not a problem, but if the chat is pg-13, so should the ads, right?
Vivix I agree. But honestly I know of a 6 year old who watches R rated films.
Yeah-
05thats not the issue
05the issue is the porn adds
When I was a kid, finding porn was like finding a treasure in the woods. Now it's everywhere
05which is why we encourage adblock
Faith in humanity is slowly leaving me
ah yeah
LOL Vivix.
That example D:
We were kids! and we DID find it in the woods
http://derpy.me/BfMBZ
Vivix you lucky bugger
hehe
Reminds me of the time when I was young I said I was gonna find treasure in my backyard
Ended up digging up a gold ring for my mother
oh yeah the ads, yeah the ones given to me have gone all the way porn
Vivix: Bah, porn! Finding a pic of a pair of boobs was a win!
I just ignore it
yeah, like lingerie ads
05well i had my first snaps at the age of 3
05i also played doom at that age
o.o
05i turned out all right
I get picks of women in underwear
hehe
I played doom at age..5 I think?
Wrek... You keep on believing that.
but dad would noot let me play Wolfenstein 3D
Wolfestein 3D is the best FPS in the world.
seez ponys on the stream monitor again ROFFL
I played GTA at 8
Wolfenstein*
wait, 8 actually
Games where just about all kid friendly then
I still remember that you character farted and burped when you pressed "Tab":D
Nowadays with stuff like dead space it sickens me.
one of the first games I played was two dinosaurs beating eachother up on an amiga
SirGanjalf, yeaah
05TheRandomkid321: kids playign dead space sickens you?
05pfft
But in all honesty i played GTA III at nine.
05ratehr have my kid play dead space and or amnesia
God I love Dead Space.
05than let them roam the street
Wrek true
Wrek every ture
TheRandomkid321: I meant the very fist GTA.
*very
*first
I knwo you did
*know
oh
What the heck is this?
TheRandomkid321: I dunno. I don't think Mortal Kombat was ever technically kid friendly. :P
I think the first game I played that was borderline inappropriate was Duke Nukem 3D, tits and blood everywhere
GoldDemoma they actually had kids in the ads.
hi everyone :)
Hello Lil_B :)
Vivix Don't mention duke nukem...
Or Conker's Bad Fur Day. That definitely wasn't.
/me sheds a tear
/me also have a TECHNOJOY
thanks MLP_Brovakiin :)
05i loved playign shadow warrior and DN3D
conker's bad fur day was 17+
HAHA Conker's Bad Fur Day
05when did it come out
of course it wasn't kid friendly
0595?
How funny that game was
0597?
duke nukem? Probably 95
dat hacking
96 97 usually had started the invasion of3d models
Gold_Demona true, Conkers Bad Fur day had Insults, Tits, Gore and Death XD
I think my first violent game was 'Soldier of Fortune' when I was 7
05then i played DN3D at the age of 5 or 6
How appriopriate; i've started playing Uplink recently
Lil_B: It had SWEARING in it.
05the thing is
05at that age
Lil_B: Which was completely unheard of in games back then
05you dont really care about boobs
1996, yeah
05you cared alot more about shootign pig cops
yeah, we just laughed at it cause it was..silly
05than hadning money to the strippers
Iam 13 and I play violent games. But I once saw a id leaving a store with dead space. a 7 year old kid.
05dead space is lightweight
Gold_Demona I like that the XBox Version is the one where "The Great Mighty Poo" got consored Lyrics :/
05decent combat and fun
05but its 90% jumpscared
LOL
05nothing else to it
Lil_B they bleeped out shit
TheRandomkid321 yep :/
I loved dead space, I can't wait untill 3
Lil_B: The game also had sex in it.
05i stopped caring for deadspace after the second one
I liked Assasins Creed. Especially online
053rd doesnt seem to add much to gameplay
Gold_Demona but onlöy Off Screen or Indicated I think
Funny how most computers processors in that game are 60Ghz, but you still connect to the net through modem
05love the universe itself
Lil_B: Yeah, it was off screen, but the sounds made it obvious. :P
05but the game mechanics are dull for me now
Wrek, /) yay someone with similar views to me.
Gold_Demona wich scene was it? I can't quite remember
I've never played Dead Space, glared at it at gamestop but- decided not to get it
Play the first one Vivix
And once again asians who will pursue me... Sigh
Tis great
Wrek: I just loved stamping to things :3
TheRandomkid321, they're outside now, crawling through the bushes
<= It's funny cause it's true
Lil_B: It was with a critter who was cheating on his wife with a flower with huge tits.
I might pick up the first one in town- just to look at it 3 for 2, right?
Gold_Demona AHH!!! Right XD Dem Tits XD
:D
Vivix, Just wait for a Steam sale, it's like $5 US when on sale.
lol AdamTheDuck
Grabs Shotgun
I think he wants to avoid the pain of downloading it with his artifact internet.
but my internet is like 0.6mbps ;__; it's cheaper in time to get it on 3 for 2 sale
And just go with teh disc.
yeah-
Disc/disk, take your pick.
05i can understand not wantign your kid to play postal though
05but then again its a bad game in its core
Wrek Yeah. Isnt thta one of the games that made video games have ratings?
I played postal as a kid
05aye
Vivix, I know that feeling of being deprived of fast internet speeds :/
TheRandomkid321: I thought that was Mortal Kombat.
it was--crazy violent, and I had fun, but I haaate violence. so- can't say it messed me up
Vivix: The internet at my dad's house is liek 0.25 mbps it is awefull :(
AdamTheDuck, it sucks ;__;
!
*like
K guys, bye for now

Goodbye SirGanjalf
Bye SirGanjalf

PHP!
In postal 2 you can burn people then put them out with urine so their all burned and bloody raw.
but yeah, Parents should decide what their kids play, they should just pay attention to it
Y U SO BROKEN
And alive
yeah-
it didn't horrify me as a kid, but it does now
I can't play it anymore, for instance
Anyone remember Clayfighter?
When your kid you basically have no mercy. But as you mature...
yeah
Sooooo.... dead.

So true :D
So, pony_1945, did you read the rules? :P
._.
There's rules? 6_9
Derp.
pony_1945, Time to tell you to read the rules before you do anything else :P
Nothing excessive, mind you, but...
I tried sleeping, but ponies
and get a name if you intend to come back :P
Ah, yes. A name.
with /nick 'nickname'
pony_1945, Aus bronys FTW /)
^see?
Dat Phase4
(\ Agreed
pony_1945, Really there is only 1 rule here, don't piss of Wrek
Follow that rule and you'll live :)
Righteo, then!
First things first, links are allowed, but no youtube links during a stream
off*
Can't be too hard, right? >_>
pony_1945: nah, he's a chill fellow
Who is a chill fellow?
Phase4?
He's a banana muffin.
Wrek too :D
?
pony_1945, i'm not sure people here belive me, but we do get big spiders here don't we
So, how much time is left of this guy?
Spiders? Yes.
Bloody oath we get big spiders.
Big ones.
Haha and then we get to tell everyone we go to school riding kangaroos
http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3189/2889724767_4b981fb853.jpg
I had one of those in my front yard.
pony_1945: Roleplaying is frowned upon in excessive quantities, so don't do that :D
hi
MadSurge, In other words; don't piss off Wrek :D
Hello LoGaN
My brother would freak out with spiders that big
i dont like this guy:|
LoGaN: then mute the stream
Keeping myself awake with sugar and tea. Not pure sugar.
But a jumbo bag of Allen's.
He drinks tea, he is my new best friend.
AdamTheDuck, move aside.
pony_1945: wat tine is it there?
:'( No love for coffee
dat jazz chicken
Coffee can go die.
10:42 PM
2043 LoGaN
Gold_Demona: :D
oops I mean 2243
10:43? pm?
Yep
This man wants to die for his country, oblige him!
pony_1945, got distracted, that a funnel web?
when i was banned it was a living hell:)
Gargantuan orb weaver.
pony_1945, i'm near melbourne, we dont get those down here thankfully, just redbacks and hunstman
"Gargantuan" sounds about right
Huntsman. They always appear around the middle/end of winter.
WHY? :'(
I DONT GET IT!
pony_1945, for the fly's
hunstman's are best spiders
The Huntsman always arrives late.
Ooh I just remembered, happy Winter Wrap Up guys! :P
That Orb Weaver was about 2 meters away from my front door.
AdamTheDuck, how do you mean?
hi MASF123
in 1 hour and 23 minutes it will be spring :P
any mods on i have a question about something
AdamTheDuck: its summer
Southern hemisphere
Kandarihu: Australians now are celebrating spring :D
Summer Wrap Up?
AdamTheDuck, Aus?
Yep
YEA spring muther buckers
AdamTheDuck, /)
I'm completely disregarding the stream and dedicating time to reading about Winter wrapping up.
Aps, (\ :3
Yeah. Okay, I was thinking he might be Australian
AdamTheDuck, do u kno if any mod are awake?
AdamTheDuck: FUCK thats why i hate earth its not WINTER ITS SUMMER! WELL YOU KNOW WHAT ITS BOTH AdamTheDuck
Wrek went for lunch, right?
Up on the northern hemisphere, the next Winter Wrap Up will be of a more economic nature.
Aps, Wrek will be back in less than an hour I think
lunck? its 8
AdamTheDuck, so no mods on atm
Post ponies Aps , time to post ponies.
:3
here ill mass-ping the mods and see if anyone answers
AdamTheDuck, lol
LoGaN, bad idea
we rarely get snow in any city here in aus, so 'winter wrap up' here just meens the air warming a bit
Phase4, just the person i need
a wild Aps appears!
Kandarihu, ducks might
lol SnoozabitHarmonie
Phase4, u kno how the newsletter is lil wierd now since kirz left but lotto is still going right?
LoGaN, less mass ping :<
^
ok
If you wake someone up, they're gonna open a can of arse whoopin' on you.
Aps, lotto is being done the old way until further notice
why do we watch this standup guy so much?
can i say hi to EVERYONE
/me curious
Cause he's da funneh guy.
Phase4, wuts the old way?
Aps, during intermisson everyone joins a channel and we randomly select someone to chose a movie
XylemTube, it's because the guy who's streaming him likes him.
Phase4, lol how many people does it generate and wens it happening next in bmn or emn?
I really like how the newsletter-less lottery is working.
That's a lot of afternoon tea
I need a nickname. 6_9
pony_1945: whats your name? cap fist letter not cap next so on like LoGaN
/nick then leave a space and then write your intended nickname :3
So original.
Yeah, but I need to come up with one D:
Become Phase5. Seems legit.
what your fav character
Like, what, pony?
LOLwut AdamTheDuck.
Hmm.
pony yes
There a name I came up with on the spot :3
and second fav
I'm torn between RD,AJ,TS,FS,PP and Rarity.
Aps, theres a thing called 'GameServ' on this irc network with a 'select random nick' command
I lol'd
i came up with mine as follows; <something i am> <something i do/make>
MrFoster
Phase4, how many people join the channel when it happens and is it during bmn or emn
pony_1945, so you're torn between all the Mane 6?
has any1 here seen Arthur and the invisibles
SpikeIsBestPony
I CAN'T CHOOSE :D
i took my name and added caps cause im always excited except when i take my meds
Aps, bmn
Phase4, k ty
pony_1945: all ponies are best pony :) we just pick favorites
twilight is best pony
bad though because im always hyper i get banned which i find unfair because I CANT HELP IT!!!
MadSurge, BLASPHEMY, Spike is best pony!
:D
I'll go cliche and say RD. Please don't flame me :'(
pony_1945: so than name your self skyclearer
RD plz flame me
my favourite is fluttershy cause i relate to her most :)
I suppose that Rainbow Dash's athleticism makes her seem more presentable to non-bronies than the others.
CeruleanBlue
^ it's a song by the way
Rainbow inspired me to actually do stuff more often.
AthleticPony :D
pony_1945: so than make yourself umm... loyal... and then your first name?
pony_1945, CeruleanBlue :3
Anyone use Flash? I like Flash.
:<
Dat Phase4 wakeup call
The program, I mean.
Pigs in giraffe's clothing
pony_1945, flash is worst software
Phase4: what :< mean
:'(
i'll admit their animation tools have done a world of good for both ameture and professional animation
Man, I can totally imagine that a couple of months into English PSO2, the monitors will be displaying a short video about the Mane6 becoming Arks.
but flashplayer is the worst piece of [explitive deleted] to ever exist in browsers
:O
/me hugs pony_1945
Gold_Demona: I know a chick that makes ponies look like cute giraffes :D
pony_1945: make yourself raptrf the first letter of all mane six pony names
Seems legit.
Now I'm gonna form a word from those letters...
Pony Star Onine 2
not enough vowles
It won't make sense.
paftrr, makes perfect sense
fraptr?
Hello guys.
RAFTPR?
Hello TheRandomkid321
FARPTR
TARRPT
wat.
:D
Who's this?
FARPTR == Far Pointer :P
I wonder what the official English name of the Darkers will be.
hey TheRandomkid321
also 'Farp' is a funny word
TheRandomkid321, New Australian brony :P
^
hi TheRandomkid321
Hmm, seems like you're Australian too
you new TheRandomkid321
Would someone please answer who this is?
No I'm not new
TheRandomkid321: Eddie Izzard
Right. I didn't notice him with the facial hair
TheRandomkid321, Oh thought you were asking who pony_1945 is :3
Right
I need a name D:
Tomorrow I'm getting a pony toy :)
Yay!
I currently have.... Twilight and Rainbow.
I'm getting my sister to help chose which one. She has a natural female instinct.
i trapped in the bathroom my brother forgot to put toilet paper in the bathroom HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(:'( CAMERON
Both from McDonalds. 6_9
pony_1945: You don't need one right away though :D
/me is still waiting for Octavia release :3
pony_1945, Twibow or Rainlight?
im not obsessed i just like the show i dont get toys
Uhm.
LoGaN Go out of there naked, grab some toilet paper, and give that brother of yours a bloody middle finger up mate
TheRandomkid321: mate?
you from alstrailia
No-one even says that! :P
I am only getting a toy to support the show. Hasbro only care about merchandise. Yes I am austarlia
I say that!
ok that explains it
ill brb
Really? I've never actually head someone say 'Mate' like that. :/
English chavs say mate as well
pony_1945: ah, stereotypes :D
I thought they said 'Chap' and whatnot.
mate = friend :D
Yeah :D
pony_1945: that's regular english people
I like how in the uk they say housemate instead of roomate
pony_1945: CHAVs say mate
Makes more sense, 'Housemate'.
They're mates, who live in the same house.
as a slang for friend, anyway
Yeah. Right. >_>
guys im gonna try and make an OC wish me luck ill show you guys when its done
Yaay!
Have fun and good luck LoGaN :P
pony_1945: i trust you know what a chav is?
I'm expecting you'll explain it? :P
pony_1945: well do you want me to?
I won't say no.
Gold_Demona: http://askloveletters.tumblr.com/ Giraffe pony! :D

Hello!
Ohai RaveBrony!
Phase4: Inbefore stupid stuff happens
Vordox, ikr
/me waves to RainbowFlashbang and MadSurge :)
/me waves to RaveBrony
to be fair apple did just spend a butt tonn of money saying samsung phones are similar enough to iphones to be considered clones
what is he doing6_9
Phase4 : didn't Apple pay Samsung a ton of money In NICKELS??
anything that happens as a result is entirely their fault
He's failhacking, duh! :P
PillowPoni, joke artical :P
Forgot what the amount was though....
lol ok
derpy56: trying to hack locks
Phase4: ohhhh...god I'm dumb lol
ok
PillowPoni, they owe about a billion, it'll be contested in a higher court though
i thought samsung had to pay apple a billion...
Didn't they send apple truckloads of coins?
also, they were going to pay them in nickels, but it would have taken 3000 trucks of nickels so they didnt
it'll be contested
Phase4: Mmhmmm...I saw a video of Siri vs the new samsung phone. Samsung phone won that shit
MLP_Brovakiin, joke artical :P
oh 6_9
access grant? wonder what the grant's worth
oh no Phase4 they were thinking of, but calculating the logistics, no
XD
twilight_sprinkle: Who is Grant?
3000 trucks it would have required
yeah, a billion in 5c coins would be hard to get
or 15 cargo planes
hahha just drop shipping containers full of coins onto apple HQ
MLP_Brovakiin: well i was thinking of the money grant, but theres a Grant Hill, NBA player if you want
:D
TrollSamsing. "Oh you'll get your money, Apple. Hope you can count in fives. Umad? "

My Little Pony is for grown men fuck WWE, scripted ass wrestling show written by rednecks.
05so i hear the republican presidency candidate is a former CEO/buissness man. is it only me who can see how fucked up that is?
MASF123, Pro Wrestling is like a Soap Opera for men
Yeah Agreed.
i'm not too surprised
Mhhm
WHY NOT?!
does it matter anymore? :(
And then when the wrestlers break up with their relationships they want to fight each other.
/me Is AFK
this places is already fucked, why not go the full 100%
Wrek: Also govener of my state, Massachusetts. Even though he isnt from there and only had a vacation home on Cape Cod.
ok MASF123 how did wwe get into this
i don't like anyone who's running for president right now. romney and obama that is
What about Nader?
pony_7007: vermin supreme
/me is AFK because Ponies47 is AFK
don't know who they are
PONIES FOR EVERYONE!
google
05ask me, obama seems liek the lesser of all evils
Vermin Supreme 2012
05atleast he tries
whoever wins we lose
Wrek: Vermin Supreme is the only why this country will improve
alexxm because Rex_Mundi was talking about FiM being for girls and Wrestling is for men that's how this conversation started
VERMIN SUPREME!
/me doesnt pay attention to politics that much...
05i jstu find it funyn how republicans are as far right as you can get. adn the democrats are cosnidered to be left
Yeeep
05while they are still pretty damn fuckign right compared to eurpean standards
Let's not talk polotics, I get enough of that shit from my father
Murika!
Everybody! just vote VERMIN SUPREME
Republicans dont stand much of a chance against Obama this time around
dem polotics
ok then MASF123"AFK
povotovs
^
IT'S GREYY'S ARMY!
Obamanation is more like it. :|
Wrek: Yeah, the United states has a conservative party (Democrats), and a effing crazy party (Republicans)
/me doesn't understand politics but knows we are al fucked at the end of every election
05murica needs some proper left wing people
05the country would be much better off with some socialist oppinions
all murica needs is some dental laws
"smiles across the nation"
SOCIALISM?!
howd are you
this is MURIKA
not commy land
Wrek: Problem is now were so far divided between parties :D
Fuck politics I'm going to move to Canada
to its people
05both could be consideredt he same party from where i am standing
05so..
StinkomanFan: Its much harder than people reaize to move to Canada
Vermin Supreme needs to be president!
Lol. No it's not.
CCCP: FINALLY SOMEBODY ACKNOWLAGES HIM
I live in Wisconsin. I can DRIVE to Canada
Rex_Mundi: It entierly depends on what skill set you have to offer.
i wish it was
we could do with a frim hand slapping the dumbasses away
I know people who HATE Republicans and dont even know a THING about them! :D
PsychoticDoc my sister's boyfriend has met him in person and been to his house
It'll work eventually Wrek
he lives rreally close to me
Yeah RaveBrony
Scoot-Scootaloo: i agree
Quick, its time for a new Bull-Moose Party! Zombie Teddy Rosevelt for US President 2012... >_>
CCCP: YES, let the shananaghens flow through you!!!
we need another andrew jackson
someone that'll tell conress to go fuck themselves
Actually all most presidents sucked just some are glorfied like Aberham lincon and JFK
05point is
Buytoast: Fuck no, Andrew Jackson was a monster.
We need another JFK
Buytoast: you mean the man that swore so much that his parrot had to be banned fromhis funeral?
we need some confedarate-commis in our goverment
http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20080702.gif Relevent
CCCP he had good faith
CCCP: well, you know he is dead, so what does it matter
And was shot later
PsychoticDoc yeah but Vietnam...
Let's not talk about 'Nam
its all Frances fault
CCCP: yeah but, we lost it, so what does it matter
Would anypony else think that Teddy Rosevelt vs Andrew Jackson would make for a good pay-per-view cage match?
roosevelt would probably come out on top
Even Abraham Lincoln owned slaves no President was ever honest
Unnr|Gardening: He also kicks tons of natives off his land, said "Fuck you" to the supreem court when they said that was illegal, was nicknamed king Andrew the 1st due to being an Autocrat, personally killed many people in duels over stupid things...
that fucker was tough as nails
Yeah,
Hitler was tough as nails
But I'm one of those people who think seeing Garfield and Marmaduke fighting to the death would be a good cage match
Benito Mussolini for prez!
MASF123|AFK: no, he wasnt tougher, he just put them in ovens
so people were kicking natives off their land before andrew jackson
son*
ANDREW JACKSON MADE IT COOL
CCCP: There are still people in Italy today who like Mussolini
Richard Nixon is best president :P
Mussolini was less evil and more crazy.
Buytoast: It was the freaking "Trail of tears"
How bout Lauren Faust for president?
MASF123|AFK Tara Strong
No NOT Tara Strong
Oh GAWD no.
Fluttershy for President!
Weird Al for President! :[
MASF123|AFK: ARE YOU CRAZY?! that would break the goverment!!!
Let's split the difference and have Twilight Sparkle win as a write-in candidate
both israel and palestine need to grow the fuck up
PsychoticDoc, of course no more govertment! :D
Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny get thousands of write-in votes every year, why not Twilight Sparkle?
MASF123|AFK: then we would nuke eachother, than fallout would happen
Exactly
'Morning everypony.
:)
hi Dovah
babara anne? ...Aw :(
Buytoast: Plus, he was unconstitutional because of what he did to the supreem court when they told him 'NO'. Andrew Jackson nearly broke the Republic.
See Israel is like Nazi Germany
PsychoticDoc, if we are dead there will be no more wars. Think about it.
It's crazy but true.
This The Doors or Elvis?
05fundamentalist within ANYTHING is bad
MASF123|AFK: that would only be because everybody is so fat, we can jump the border fast enough, if at all
cant*
Could also be Johny Cash...
Cuba is a good country
CCCP: Plenty of worse countries than Cuba out there
Cuba is corrupt
Rex_Mundi like the USA
But not the worst country
lolololololol
05Cuba does everything but the democracy well
0,5Wrek what game is this?
05very generalized statement
OH BOY, HERE WE GO WITH THE BRITS BEING ALL UPPITY ABOUT THEMSELVES
Fallout New Vegas
0,5Ah, thought it was a fallout game
00,03BaconMane: Shaq-Fu
0,5Is that slang for stuf?
0,5*stfu
0,5>:
lol
00,03It's an actual game :D
0,5o
05i like this sogn
It's a fighting game about Shaq
Wrek: Cuba has democracy, its just not the freedom thing they got. All Republics are somewhere between Democracy and oligarchy. The United states isnt truly a Democracy, and China isnt totally oligarchic.
The Basketball player
oh no not Shaq-Fu
Isnt there a website dedicated to finding and destoying every copy of that game StinkomanFan?
05correction then: cuba does everythign but multiparty systems and freedom of speech well
yeah there is
05as a generalization
Still can't tell if that was Elvis, Johny Cash or The Doors
Wrek: True, only the communist party is allowed to exist, though the people get to elect their offcials. The Castros keep getting reelected.
Castro is awesome
My brain has officially been fried with politics
So, anypony here gonna try and win a Saxxy?
My fried has been brain! :P
:D
0,5Hey how come there's no reticle?
Saxxy?
Japan needs to NOT make more nuclear power plants
Saxxy, It's an award for the best TF2 short
0,5How are you s'posed to hipfire with no reticle? :/
just like we need to get rid of all of our nuclear weapons and anything similar to it
CCCP: Best way to troll cubans in Florida, shout Viva le castro!
Rex_Mundi lol
But seriously though, Castro aint that bad really, lots of people blame him for his country being poor. But there are plenty of poor as dirt capitalist countries that have it much worse than Cuba.
CCCP why that Earthquake that happened?
You know who's worse than Castro?
Kim Jung Il
North Korea is pretty much the worst country ever.
MASF123|AFK yeah
Rex_Mundi Western Propaganda
Kim Jung Il was a crazy bastard who deserved to die in a worse way
Communisn in North Korea, btw
Communism
StinkomanFan uh he invented the cheese burger!
heh, north Korea never had communism
it didn't?
CCCP name me ONE good thing about Kim Jung Il, and McDonalds invented the Cheesburger you liar!
:D
0,5Lol politics
0,5screw that
MASF123|AFK: North Korea- Communist in name only, and they dont even claim that anymore.
Actually, I'm going to go look that up
BaconMane you and me both
StinkomanFan http://listverse.com/2010/05/30/top-10-crazy-facts-about-kim-jong-il/ look at number 7
Screwing politics, not each other I mean! :O
The cheeseburger was invented in 1926 by Lionel Sternburger
0,5:I
Politics are in RED DEAD REDEMPTION and I don't understand any of it.
Sternburger!
Nah, the politics in RDR is actually just Black Mail
The Dear leader is far more like a Pharoe than a communist.
Howard Stern and burger cames to mind
comes
Sternberger, my bad
politics and blackmail aren't that differnt sonny jim
Has howard stern said anything about Bronies again since?
There not? But isn't Blackmail illegal?
They're
you think that stops people?
no
Hell no, but then pollictics should be illegal then.
politics
Damn keyboard
And the HAMBURGER was invented in the 12 century using Horse Meat
Horse meat...YUM. :)
StinkomanFan awww :(
StinkomanFan why would you wish for death to happen to anyone? :(
I dont know why Horse meat isnt allowed in the USA, thats stupid.
Everyone dies one way or another
It was gonna happen eventually CCCP, but I was hoping a more ironic one for him
so check out my message to you!
Like a statue of himself falling atop of him.
If The Scatman could do it so can you!
StinkomanFan thats pretty harsh you know
...sorry Lol. R.I.P Scatman John
Again, name me one TRUE GOOD thing about Kim Jung-Il
He's Asian
There you go.
StinkomanFan: He died?
And that's about all you can name, He's asian and he's dead
StinkomanFan well we dont have much info on North Korea so its kinda hard
I need to go listen to Scatman now
:D
Does anyone ells think that this time of year is weird? Its too different from Fall and the rest of summer.
Wrek, you should heal yourself
Scatman?! Where!?!
StinkomanFan so every one has to change the world to be respected after they die?
I am not going to respect a lunatic who tortures his own country
StinkomanFan then why you respect any president eve?
ever*
Because they were fairly elected and not self-appointed
Except for Nixon
Fuck Nixon

00,10ewwww gay
What gay Sumica? :3
My dad said he was scared of gays when he was young cause whenever one came out to him, they hit on him
Your father should be fattered
you calling him fat?
hehe, in retrospect he probably is
Don't call his daddy fat, have you no respect?
i think he meant flattered
I didn't see the typo until now! *very offended
My dad's fat, I can only assume all dads are fat
MASF123|AFK: you're assuming Vivix is a he >.>
I am ;__;
what's Wrek's rad metre sitting at?
lol
just a point :D
hey everypony :)
hey Sketch_Toku_Brony
Really Vivix? Because you kinda have a girl's name
Sundaysmile: about 350
Vivix is a he!
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
how you doing Sketch_Toku_Brony
It is a girly name, but I like girly things so- yeah
im doin good alexxm
Wrek might want to visit a doctor for that radiation poisoning...
/me hugs Sketch_Toku_Brony
aw thanks :$
Vivix you do manly things like watching MLP: FiM
Yeah, it makes up for all the other things
Vivix: yeah, girly things, like football and politics. not manly stuff like ponies
hehe

well " a lot" twice past two days
Tis a good program, the adverts annoy me when I let them slip though.
I got free premium via phone company
so yay-
Sonova.
Fun fact: That robot is one of only three characters tthat will never die during the course of the game.
I love how no-one siad bye to StinkomanFan

/me eats Jmo's trout
forget to buy radaway wrek?
so how does New Vegas run on pc compared to console?
Hehe, girls are nice too
05they didnt have any
ada strauss not have any?
My main bass is decorated with frills, lace, pinkie pie doll and jewlery, even hte metalheads in college were nice abot it
goodbye Everypony
bye Maid_RainBow
<3
Vivix: Metalheads tend to be chill people, so long its the ones that realize how rediculous (and fun) metal is, and not the ones that take themselvs too seriously.
yeah, most metal heads I know are nice, but most I meet online can be--pretty mean
Metal ;~;
the weirdest metal head at that school that looked like he lived on a yacht, you know short blonde hair slicked back, sunglasses and open shirt and shorts. and he played death metal drums
My mind was blown of stereotypes
lol
You think bronies are misrepresented in the Media? Ever watch one of those Crime drama shows? if there is an episode that involvs metal fans, its always satanism and "hardcore" stuff...
yeah-
It's called stereotypes
A excuse to see something as negative
there is no escape
Of coarse, the Furries have it the worst when it comes to steriotypes....
Rex_Mundi no not really
can i somehow change my Password for my name?
I feel like racial sterotypes are worse
I''ve met more people who believe the furry stereotype than believe any racial ones
so many people on the internet are racist asshole, and are like "racsim is natural"
Vivix I know how it is,
klrpwny73 pls.
oh cool wreks streamin
u no nthng
totally CCCP lol cant watch Tosh.0 with it having at least 1 racial joke,its like "really? jeez :S"
<3
Jmo pls <:
Rex_Mundi but the steriotype is somtimes true
Wrek Found the armory in the vault yet?
CCCP: Yeah, there are some furries that make me shake my head...
eeyup
like most places, yeah
Does that rad meter go from left to right, or right to left?
Right to left I think
say did fallout get any mlp mods?
Rex_Mundi Every fandom/community has a the major and quiet then the more middle ones that are at times a bit vocal but ok mostly, Then extreme fanatics
some gun mods, and someone working on a total conversion
Fuck
fanatics are the spooky ones, and the loud ones that represent the fandom
I only want to play games in life.
Rex_Mundi also many bronies are steriotypical bronies, you cant deny that.
I want to appreciate life more. :(
Vivix Generally what stereotypes are based on too....
But how?
CCCP I don't clop thank you very much.
MASF123|AFK appreciating life is like trying to appriaciate shit
Or likc the pony toy asses
good... Defence Grid 2 and Project Giana god funded, looking forward too them :)
hehe
MASF123|AFK i never said you did
I love life, despite it not being-perfect
CCCP how does that make me feel better?
MASF123|AFK oh im sorry :(
I can't appreciate a huge hunk of duty
MASF123|AFK: Who brought up clop?
Change of topic, Soo who likes muffins?
MASF123|AFK I always think "Beeig dead sucks... I can't even Talk to people, eat, drink, play or move :( ... or watch MLP :P"
Rex_Mundi, CCCP said most Bronies are streotypical clopping is a stereotype for us.
oh biy, dragonwars for b-movie
no, not most, some- didn't he say that?
Vivix A good saying i got in my head is, ''If you can't accept life as it is and realise *perfect* is a very bad term to use as you can't be good at everything or anything like that. Maybe you aren't exactly fit for the world''
Hmm...Interesting look at it Lil_B
MASF123|AFK i didnt say all bronies are i just said most...
pegasisters go in there too
everypony clops, didn't you know that? :3
I know MOST but I am in that catergory am I not?
killerpony7733, good words, yeah. I try to- I have like most people som issues, but- life is a fun journey, no matter where I end up
The thing about furries is that its a diverse fandom with different communities. Id say Furaffinity is the best (although somewhat hostile and trollish) community, wear as So furry is full of degenerates
and just becasue some one is a steriotype doesnt mean there a bad person
CCCP Bronystate is one of the most sane Brony places, that's why I generally hang out here :)
depends on the stereotype though...
Vivix Indeed though not every turn is fun or good for you, You gotta accept life will not bend to your will.
i think i came back to the right kind of discussion B)
Do with what you have, not what you don't
Lil_B it still has its moments
of course, bad things happen, and once you accept that, it won't hurt as much
so just saw a trailer announcing Gotham City Imposters is free to play,wonder if itll be f2p on consoles as well?
got some lethal rad sickness there wrek
for example, I'm going on a Meetup tomorrow, and I know that it will be filled with shirts endless quotes, and pony songs
"All Canadians are half-bear axe murderers" is not a stereotype
it's a fact of life
hehe
lol
Vivix Very much so. Some people look weird at me when i shrug things off due to accepting as a fact ot life
why do most comments say shut up and listen to the music? then whats the comment section for?
on yt
All germans are Jew killing Warlovers... a Stereotype I have too face way too often on the Web
Guys, sorry if I'm being silent, but I learned that one of my highschool classmates hanged herself. Sorry if I'm a party pooper or I'm not wacky at the moment, but...
even better are the kind of people who are convinced everbody hates germans
MadSurge :(
im so sorry
thats horrible
Lil_B: unfortunately so, i see it happen a lot. i have to deal with a lot of people thinking i wear a top hat and a monacle and have a handlebar moustache all the time :/
MadSurge: Oh jeez, you have my condolences :(
So what are the brony sterotypes? I dont think most people know of the adult artwork, I think they percieve us more as man-children who refuse to grow up. And that is false
MadSurge: oh dear. many condolences my friend :(
Rex_Mundi, I think the stereotype is manchildren, yeah. Basement dwellers like that nerd collector episode for powerpuff
/me hugs MadSurge :(
05if swearing is immature, then why is it reffered to as adult language?
I'm sorry to hear that MadSurge, always suck to have that happen
MadSurge that is terrible... :(
I don't even want to cry...
A lot of adults are immature Wrek
Honestly swearing helps expressing yourself thought not pleasantly, it's a way to express yourself
being Mature is a sign of self hate and stupidity
now you're catching on CCCP
I was raised not knowing what swearing was
my principal washed my mouth with soap
How does that CS luis quete go? The desire to be grown up is a sighn of immaturity?
As did I
It's a way to lack use of vocabulary and use fuck or shit for anything in a conversation
/me washes Vivixs mouth with soap
Scottish here, learned to swear before I learned to walk
i grew up around swearing, i just never was told what they meant so i never needed to use them
MadSurge *hugs again :*
;__;
:3
trønder here, tons of swearing here, but I hardly swear anymore
Holy fuck that shit was fucking shit you know? Like.....FUCK man.
be mature when the need arises, other wise, have fun like children
ø
wat
o.o
is someone bitching that swearing is immature?
Lol. Your a bitch.
*hugs vivix*
WUT.
Thanks a lot guys. Much appreciated.
english here, i only swear around my friends/people i feel comfortable around
I thought it was you lol
FUCK
/me hugs Rex_Mundi
Let's keep swearing. Nothing wrong with that. Lol. >_>
A better way to say it is, Enjoy life like you would as a kid, But still take it serious and face it with a maturity.
^
well no shit
/me sighs
so true...
:/
the only swearing I think is absoutlely horrible, is when people do it in other langauges, like people swearing in english in Norwegian sentences, or english with german swears, etc- or the typical japanese swears
I think "damn" is the wors word I use :/ ... I just have no need for the other words :/
I say fuck as an exaggerated joke sometimes
because its so fast and loud-
Vivix is a baka gaijin
buck u budi
like that?
I keep hearing fuck in like every sentence in Mafia 2 which makes it feel less original when they spam a swear.
yeah
Vivix I generally dislike people using foreign words they don't even know the meaning of
and like typical oslo gangsta kid around norway is like- every otehr word is FACK in broken english
yeah
i think that swearing just for no reason is fucking stupid and fucking ponitless
i only ever swear in public in japanese, cause i know a few in japanese
or like that guy from District 9
Fookin prawns!
hey Vivix, do you have a picture of your frill lacey bass?
Vivix I hear way too many young danes using mixed danish an english which sounds horrible at times
If I was in a better mood I'd wax on about how Italy swearing involves God and all the Saints
MadSurge *hugs again*
well... I would swear in different languages to be weird and nonsensical again XD
Rex_Mundi, parts of it, I can try taking a picture of the headstock, even if its a bit tattered atm
killerpony7733, yeaah, it sounds really odd-
Vivix: i lost my wallet today, but i found it again :3
MadSurge it's ok, you did nothing wrong :)
Vivix And worst yet, Most that do it are those people who dress as if they were gangsters or rappers or heck if i know
good thing too, it has all the cash for my bass in it
BronyInstrumental, hehe, I lost my credit card, found it a few days ago after 2 months without it
I got 2000 dollars on it after paying bills, thanks to having lost it
Lil_B: but what if I payed attention? I could have talked her out of it...
Vivix: credit cards suck. i'm never getting one
Vivix What type of credit card?
bankcard, I don't have credit on it, but it's easier to say
Wow Vivix, sucks to be you bro.
A credit card is handy if you treat it wisely
I had a Debit Card.
today I wore my Pony shirt today, they joke obout it in a fashion that I'm able to laugh aout myself too... and they still have no Idea about MLP XD
Vivix: hell, i don't even have a debit card yet, all my money is cash
the only loan I have is studenet loan
ah yeah- loosing cash is D=
HAHA Student loan.
;__;
/me glomps Vivix
You poor muffin
/me licks Jmo's face
i don't need a student loan, education is free in england :3
hehe it is here too
but college is not
college is too :P
well, 50% is payed if you pass
here it depends on the college
Vivix I use a mastercard and it has one down side here in denmark though, Some stores refuse to have it as a payment method but else it's god damn good as a international card to pay with
I took a nondegree musical college, it's private own and costs money
all education is free in england, apart from like private tutors of musical lessons, THOSE cost
aah killerpony7733 my parents use mastercard- I only have Visa, withou credit
MadSurge you don't have to blame yourself, you weren't he only person who had a chance to stop it, nobody saw it coming appearently
Don't lipa cost like thousand of thousands of euro?
Liverpool institute of performance art
Wrek you drew that background?
Books!
Twilight
idk, i don't live in liverpool :P
Lil_B: I told only my best friend about ponies and he was like "WTF", but then I showed him the Big Lebowski Ponies and that apparently was enough to change his mind :D
I think schools like that cost money since they aren't government owned, I think LIPA costs quite a bit
wouldn't surprise me
but i don't need to worry about the rest of the world for a while, i'm still in high school
MadSurge XD I guess I actually have no reference to show them :/ none of them are even Cartoon or Animation fans :/ (well, 2 were and I told them XD but they haven't watched anything yet)
Lil_B: this guy likes Spongebob and Fairy Oddparents
who does?
i lol'd when i learned that most people in my school knew about bronies before I did, and i am one :D
MadSurge I don't know the later one, but If I knew someone who still likes Spongebob in my class I would show him MLP XD
Lil_B: :O you've never seen the fairy odd parents?
Fairy oddparents is pretty fun at times
I'm a cartoon nerd, so mlp was inevitable-
i remember when fairy odd parents started
i loved fairy odd parents, and spongebob back when it was good
BronyInstrumental never heard of it ... maybe in german though
BronyInstrumental: neither did I
Oh my...
Lil_B: i shall google translate it and see if it rings a bell to you :D
djwrek?
Wrek: no
BronyInstrumental just show me the wikipedia article, they change some titles to whatever they want in germany XD
Lil_B: ziemlich seltsam Eltern
what song is this? sounds familiar
Better than DJSneakypants

Vivix I'm however pleasantly surprised MLP FIM has not been shown on any known cartoon channel so far atleast here in denmark
Its 12:20PM where I live right now
05wub wub wub
No Ponies47 this is a NO FUN ZONE.
It's 6:19 PM here
STOP.
killerpony7733, really? We have it on boomerang at veeery irregular times-
I thouht boomerang owned the rights in entire scandinavia, hm
/me Dances on Barbetos|AtWork 's head
05wub wub wub
is this a pendulum song?
killerpony7733: I know they aired FiM on two channels here in Italy, no more
i recognise the style
Wrek: All da wub
Stop you criminal scum! You have broken the lawl!!
Vivix Idunno again i had VERY little time on the TV since i am on the PC mostly. But i know we don't have MLP FIM on the channels we have in my home
i don't get the hub, MLP FiM isn't shown on boomerang in england anymore : <
BronyInstrumental: ikr :(
BronyInstrumental: Awww :<
killerpony7733, aww- yeah we have it on boomerang, as said, but it's very hard to catch since both boomerang and CN sometimes seem to be on shuffle
BronyInstrumental: thank goodness for the internet!
if the contracts run out in europe, they can sell it on itunes internationally
until the contracts run out, we can't buy the show on itunes
it was on boomerang for like a week, but i rebuffed it for the obvious reasons when i first saw it
BronyInstrumental: you can't get anything MLP related in england :(
Vivix Well i'm SURE that if you have like one of the super channel packs for your TV you could get to find it. But that would cost lotsa money
05i like this song
I can watch all the german MLP Episodes in the Nick site ... for free and legal :/ Question... do I want too?
Wrek indeed
to*
05not the best techno/whatever

MadSurge *hugs again im so sorry*
You're such a good person, Scoots.
hehehe Scoot-Scootaloo
yay!
/me snickers
/me Feeds Scoots a cookie
by the way, whats on the stream? ... (I really need to get my connection good again before S3 starts ... )
lol wha?
wow, scumbag pinkie. I wish pinkie was like this.
/me fucks up plays all notes wrong
wow this is messed up
this is hilarious.
I've only got 0.6. but by some unholy miracle the stream usually runs fine, I really really need better before s3 jus in case, though
this amuses me
Sumica is the one who streams from hub directly?
lol
/me Makes "Me Gusta" face
PillowPoni: apparently she had a heated discussion with her boyfriend
Scoot-Scootaloo: you should play all the literal versions.
lol
00,10Yes Vivix
Evil Scientist dad.
Oh good, cause your streams are usually lag free even on my connection-
so s3..should probably be fine
/me noms on pizza
brb
random parade is best parade
this made me smile more than the actual song.
EPIC
/me hugs MadSurge and pats his back
LIES]
all is best pony
pretty literal lyrics
Dashie is best pony
So this is if Tobuscus was a brony?
Kammerjunk: eeeyup
pretty much
ooohhh.
Vivix I have 0.36 at a maximum and I was lag free usually... now I'm at 10kb/sex for a week now
this is just poorly done
why.
Lil_B, uaaah woah--yeah
SOLRAC WAS HERE?
/me would need Pinkie in real life to sing him Smile Smile Smile
that was me and a fake username
We moved from a 16mbps line to a 0.6, considering going wireless to see if its faster-
Still makes more sense than the actual sense.
Vivix enough to do anything... except downloading and watching videos
dammit pass!
Back
lol
than the actual song*
Lil_B, yeah- with 0.6 I have to buffer fo 360p youtube
I can't imagine 10kbs-
Oprah: Gangam Style?
despite having had that at some point in my life
i just took the cinnamon challange and barfed
the thoughts I have sometimes...
murica
00,03Blame Sumica
Vivix wait... 0.6 are 600kbit/s right? or 60?
also, hi Celes_Chere! (been a while.)
00,03:P
what. the fuck.
MURICA.
600 yeah, so it averages at around 400kbps I think
WallDives: Yes it has, sup
what be this?
yes, I can feel the patriotism in this one
:[
ello there IshNewLaptopPony
stupid sexy Murica
00,10hmmmm?
00,10oh
00,03MURRIKA!
Oh wow :D
Sumica, do you just get pinged every time someone says "stupid sexy"?
00,10no I get pinged when some one says sumica
00,03Kammerjunk: I do...
no one said Sumica
you just did.
IshNewLaptopPony: Scoots did
00,03I said Blame Sumica -_-
Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh my.
Vivix: mmm... I usually didn't had to buffer for 480p YT Videos with 360kbit/s ... (but I still watched at 3060 most of the time wo be shure to not buffer) ... maybe it's something else with your connection
And on that day, Uncle Sam lifeted his fat folds and a thousand eagles showed MURIKA with cheeseburgers and free medicare.
And everyone clapped.
IshNewLaptopPony *hugs*
now microwave it
00,10wow Scoot-Scootaloo, IshNewLaptopPony just called you no one
00,03You floozy >: (
NOT THE PING! D:
Dat timing.
Oh god :D
Perfect timing.
Lil_B, might be- 240 runs smooth to me, but 360 takes a buffering, yeah- the connection here is borderline, when we ordered the ISP told us they could not guarantee any speeds to us, and therefore would not let us pay more than minimum package
YES :D
I need to play MWC.
IshNewLaptopPony hug?
CCCP hmmmm........
NO!!!!
Lmao :D
in fact, often downloading gives me 80kbps-
best game ever
00,03moment. gonna turn the volume up~
IshNewLaptopPony :C why?
BEST PRESIDENT EVER
Quick question: I'm an absolute idiot, is it fine to put a plaster on a wound I made with a knife (No, I don't cut myself like that)?
08,01hehehe
00,10voulume should be maxed at all times scoot
CCCP it illegal
08,01i just saw a video someone made of BUCK, and it's pretty effing cool
Kammerjunk, depends if the wound can close itself, if it can it should be fine-
Vivix oh :/ well, 360 is the maximum for my village, I think my actual contract is at 600kb/s
IshNewLaptopPony D:
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT!
00,03Sumica: Line in is a floozy and has two different volume things
pss something
08,01Sumica: seriously?
Kammerjunk: In a pinch? Better than an infection.
00,03Clame Macs :(
00,10yeah
pass: Not ponoes if that's what your looking for -_-
Lil_B, ah yeah- same ish as here then, we are to ofar away from the central- but they're hoping we can get 3G here, which would be faster- but cost a bit more in bandwith

Kandarihu: is the game customizable or is that a mod?
I once played a Flash game like this, when you put "Specials" up to "Mayem" it was like this, flashing rotating, speed changes etc
NAME OF THE VIDEO!?
<=== is a pony dancing to this?
This would be a lot of fun to do on an ITG machine
I call shenanigans.
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE!?!?
DEATH by DDR
I'm still mad I couldn't watch Caterlot Wedding here due to the server problems

What game is this?:D
This guy is just obnoxious
13people that swear so much have no creativity

Ohai Shizuka
Shizuka: He has creativity, just verbal though :P
Indeed
Yeah Shizuka

Shizuka: This reminds me of Nova.
Stop wasting ammo!
13ooo look how tough i am, i can say words i heard on the back of my elementary school bus

Sure Sumica!
Sumica I will later tonight.

Obviously, this guy has a lot of pent-up frustration. An unhealthy level to be sure.
Shizuka: Needs more caps lock :D
Oh right
Shizuka: Some comedians use cussing well, otherwise I agree
I forgot
Shizuka: He's creative, cause he does some change here and then :P
to blatantly say people who use alot of swear words have no creativity is just blatantly ignorant
/me checks to see what science has done what I was away.
"motsly"
Ouch
Shizuka: as always, I completely agree
00,10do I have you on steam Stinko|TF2?
I think the AVGN is the only good example on how to use endless repeating of swearing for comedic value
blatantly
Lil_B: Agreed.:D

Welp
It's from to different videos

Where's the sound from then?
boom
I know the anime source.
Burning house? Bring out the camera!
Anime? I seriously doubt that audio from that might be from anime.
I thought some of the wtfboom audio came from Mega64
I know KYM knows it
wtf boom is actually compiled audio from a video, and two ads i think
Kandarihu: It had an anime source =P
Vordox, oh, okay.

Hey boys, it's a spy!
RATATATAT

It was very stupid debate
It was all because of one stupid sound effect...
AJIsAwesome spike isn't in that scene anyway :/ but rarity is there, and everyone else got one :(
XylemTube: Spy around here
Scoot-Scootaloo: haven't you seen Bronies React To? He explicity tells us 30 times it's not a kiss
i hate it when the hub causes stupid shipping kiss debates...
Lil_B: Yeah :(
Who tells us?
I actually don't hear people saying spike is their favorite.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Fighting Feelings
robotdragon9: It's more of the fans than the show itself.
Kawaii_icybeauti: Spike aint pony
00,03I remember FlutterDash fans went nuts!
AJIsAwesome (I ment it more as a joke anyway... but still like to point it out)
00,03Anyway, time for nostalgia!

Kiss? wait,what? I mustve missed something O_o
Nostalgia
In anycase... <3Cadance<3
Kawaii_icybeauti: He's his own poll =3
00,03I mean it. Nostalgia.
?
Kawaii_icybeauti hmm, wonder if he has less fans than applejack
Kawaii_icybeauti, the debate is usually as to who is best pony. And Spike isn't a pony.
looking at the actual animation, it's kiss on the nose. But hey, we also took "you're game?" in a totally different direction too so, hey whatever.
Kawaii_icybeauti: Well, between Crackle and Spike
Spike isn't best pony, but he's best dragon.
Dken2021: Oh totally.
OH.
Aw Snap!!
oh dear

FlutterMEDIC: THIS WAS BEFORE AUTOTUNE

NO COMPLAINS
Why would they be celebrating when they just had two of their friends kidnapped?
THE FIRST EVER LOL
Nopony liked them Spade
(in my memory)
Vordox: i realize that, but they could've atleast got some voice actors for the singing
I'm not complaining about the song....Probably without all the songs in these, smile wouldn't exsist.
FlutterMEDIC: Nevah, real > Fake
Nobody liked Twist
disregard friends aquire cloud flying
Suddenly Megan falls to ehr death
Twist left applebloom after she got her cutie mark.
DED
Kawaii_icybeauti: No she didn't
NOT BIG SUPRISE
So...
Vordox: Hoiw come they haven't hung out since.
Kidnapped human...why?
Kawaii_icybeauti: Technially, Appleblom left Twist.
Kawaii_icybeauti: They have, I've sene a few scenes with AB and Twist
Kawaii_icybeauti: She joined the CMC, remember?

If sea ponies are in season 3 that would be AWESOME!
lawl CamelTovler
Sumica from that other episode?
Yeah. The term Sea Pony implies that they live in saltwater, but it's a river so it's freshwater.
Sumica: THere's another one?
Ponies47: People would bitch
Funfact: Lauren wanted to make a Seapony episode
It never got made under her watch
SpadeMagnes[R]: <.< No?
SpadeMagnes[R] there better be one soon
SpadeMagnes[R]: You sure?
Vordox: And I wouldn't give a shit and just watch and enjoy :P

Going to play TF2. Have fun guys
Forget it. I'm using Iris.
bye StinkomanFan
You should totally find a filly Dash model too
Bye StinkomanFan
I want to get some paints and try my hand at painting them up
If only the fight in Diablo 3 was even half this cool.
Anyone logged on Flash?
or maybe it would be easier to just order the right color of plastic for each model... dont think the shades will be perfect though.
I've been feeding my PSO2 mag for a while now. It's Lvl 73 now. It won't be long before I'll have to start being careful about what it's stats are.
New Jersey is worst Middle Earth

NOOOOO
with a sharpie marker for size reference http://i.imgur.com/BgwME.jpg
Pony jerky? NOO!!!!!
Tovler, don't spoil the vote.
Sam : "this is the most i've complained about mordor since i left the shire...." Frodo: "Sam....shut up"
Brad__: How much did the printer + supplies cost?
Kandarihu: but.the.dark.one.commands.
AJIsAwesome, about $800 for the printer + 2 rolls of plastic
Brad__: Cool.
plastic is about $50 a kg, or 2.2 pounds
Tovler, but you don't have to obey
Kandarihu why wouldnt he obey?
Im going to make more if anyone wants one once I feel less sick from inhaling acetone fumes.
Might make some larger ones as well.
maybe 2x or 3x scale
LOL
13it's true, sailor moon costumes are the leading cause of glomps
Finally, it works now.
:S
xD
but srsly what's with Rifftrax. They've been bashing Ron Paul since 2006.
It's true. We kittens do not like going for walkies.
Who the hell is Ron Paul?
Tovler: Opinions.
13ron paul fans are typically very overzealous about it
13they practically turned into OWS the other night at the RNC
Acronyms blew my mind
Vivix, an ultra isolationist GOP presidential candidate. He's had some good stances and some bad stances.
SEEMS LEGIT.
Aah
I laughed at a comment last night on an episode, "twilight goes into the forest to meet with some african chick, gets stoned."
Shuizuka actually ron paul is very popular
He's got some decent ideas. But his fanbase is more overzealous than any I've seen.
but OWS doesn't exist. Even Michael Moore has forsaken it.
whats OWS
Most of his good policies are going through Congress anyway
Under Precious~
Sam'g got the right idea.
13paul runs the libertarian ideals pretty well, but ultra isolationism failed years upon years ago
alexxm, Occupy Wall Street. The Democratic Party's attempt at making their own version of the Tea Party
ah cool rifftrax
13sticking your fingers in your ears and going LA LA LA LA LA doesn't typically work
Yeah, it's too late for isolationism.
Good afternoon my little ponies! :)
oh ok Kandarihu
Much, much too late.
hehe
how you doing Klumzeedragon
Vivix: You are lucky then.
Good evening everypony.
Dat march theme
Here, everyone kinda agrees but kinda disagrees, so voting is like--watteful unless you really know politics
and I don't
BTW, the OWS protesters, those guys aren't libertarians.
13orc strong but they not smart
how've things been Malavolent
Kandarihu hear about they got rid of all maine convention delegates?
Malavolent: Hello!
OWS didn't have anyone in charge and they had no goals. They were just attention whores.
Good thing that hobbits don't smell like manflesh, then, otherwise that'd be a false positive
Malk, no I didn't
alexxm: Ugh, I'm tired and there are only 2 days left before I have to return to school.
In Canada, we have like 2 elections a year.
alexxm: What about you?
i'm good Malavolent
Kandarihu ron paul won maine hands down and the gop got rid of them
13gotta give the orcs credit, they smell our heroes even though they're like a day ahead or more
Tovler, there were people in charge of OWS. They just kept themselves hidden in order to make it look organic.
Kandarihu: lol @ "some people"
Shizu: And it's awful lucky that hobbits smell totally different, because otherwise it'd be a massive plothole that Frodo and Sam can so easily sneak through their ranks with such a terrible disguise.
Shizuka: It's because haven't bathed since they set out from Rivendel
13Fl00tersh41: right..... good point
13well, presumably they bathed in lorien
/me Pinkie_Pie is best room
Shizuka: My whole life is a lie.
13but true, from the end of fellowship to now must be a few weeks, rohan's quite a ways from the waterfall
Cant beleive you dint hear about that Kandarihu
Shizuka: Just imagen how Gimli must smell after practically bathing in orc blood for days in Morias mines
they're taking the hobbits to isanguard
Aquaman!
The whole thing was clearly astroturf. Professionally-made signs, luxury catering, and all the love from the msm.
13he could simply walk into mordor, kill them all with the stench
So whats going on with the main chat room? I cant log in
Malk, in fact, I didn't.
yea but smells like tht on dwarves only last for a short while
Shizu: But....but one does not simply do that D:
Shizuka: Throw in a few days of sweaty cross country running
pony_364477, are you unable to claim your normal nick?
I wonder if Sauron has another tower for his second eye.
Nyst - you haven't seen the other side of the planet
13Nyst: he's a demoman
Depth-perception and all that.
it makes the view from outerspace hilarious
Kandarihu Its amazing that they did that I think what they did just plain take the honor out of the gop
...and buffer >_<
13clearly monoculus moved to middle earth and set up shop
/me looks at all the candidates OWS put in for this election.
Shikuza: you mean he has a second tower of his hand holding a bottle of booze that give the finger?
Tovler, what candidates?
Ugh. Buffles the Clown is buffering my video. Do not want.
nah Sauron has been more like a one eyed monster dicking with everyone fore awhile now
13mount doom is the booze
mount booze?
Kandarihu: exactly
Tovler they didnt have candidates it was just a protest
Nyst: A lack of depth perception would explain why he has so much trouble telling how close he is to the source of ALL OF HIS POWER. :P
I try to log in, and I get this message "Flash policy problem. If you are the server owner please read...

There is no time when less work gets done in politics then during an election.
zap2it was EQD's source of spoilers, and evidently they done mixed up MLP with another show
anyone else getting a "Steam has detected a problem and has to be closed" problem after starting TF2? Since the Steam client update from today i cant play TF2 anymore -_-
Must avoid EQ.D for awhile now

alfopony: Hello!
GilDash: Hello!
You know what would be weird, if there are horses in the ponyverse, but they are just normal horses that dont talk or anything... and ponies can ride them.
They used a real helmet? Its Brandon Lee all over again.
well, not quite
that family circus tracking
Rex_Mundi: Ponies riding ponies?
alfopony and GilDash: Hallo! :)
Rex_Mundi o_o wow that WOULD be weird
:$
Rex_Mundi, Im pretty sure ive seen ponies riding other ponies in a few episodes...
Shizuka: I did not know that! 6_9
Rex_Mundi: It wouldn't be any different than Goofy walking Pluto
lol dat Holy Grail reference
He is Brave Sir Robin, Brave Sir Robin~

Sir Robin! :D
Lots of desert, then abrupt cut to Jungle
It's an impressive feat to follow those tracks

Well, you know. Rangers are magical.
Considering all the horses that would also have galloped all over that place
Shizuka: There are various moments like that in these movies, like the knife thrown at Aragorn in the first movie was accidentally really thrown right at viggo and he really did deflect it with his sword. Also, Gandalf hitting his head in Bilbos house was an accident.
And the battle that was fought there

It's more STEEL the black

CCCP: That depends. What's going on in life for you?
He ran off-
Hope he get's better soon
dem Easterlings

Vordox: But "The Steel Gate" doesn't really have that same ring to it
CK|GW2: Indeed not
Needs more Vuvuzela
CCCP: Yeah, life is hard mate. But that's why you have great friends to help you through the tough times.
okay so since no pony used the beta code they won last week im going to give it away in a question arie so get ready for the question
Klumzeedragon: We do?
That seems like an impractically large gate.
Vordox: We're all friends here, no? :)
id like to think so
Well, as close as we can be
and it looks like a rock how?
Quick_Thinker - elven cloak?
hard water in the laundry
Lmao
Because magic
Quick_Thinker: It's a magically magic cloak of elven.
Yeah. We're all friends here.
And as we know, magic pretty much does whatever the writer says so
Magic is as magic does, or- what that saying goes
how*
cept it seems to backfire on Harry and twi
and ron
I like the magic in MLP, it seems very limited compared to other magic fictions
13vogue two three four
with harry, its cuz well.....yea. with twi its just funnier when it happens to the skilled
Aw man I'm gonna miss Rifftrax again?!
it is not limited they have fuckin time travel
Come on, Vogue
D:
/me cries
just saying
Vivix: Same here. I like how they don't overuse it.
ALSO HI PEOPLE
limited time travel, but look at how she can't use get out of jail free card with magic, and how little magic normal unicorns have
WindWhistler: Hello. Why are you crying?
HELLO everyone :) how are you all doing today ? :P
AJIsAwesome, yeah, it gives it an extra zing
they have powerful magic its just that they cant exactly use it cause they dont havve the skills to
Cuddly as a what?
Vivix: Yeah. Well Twi is also just a student. xD
Vivix: They use telekinesis and similar magic constantly
AJIsAwesome: Because I have an appointment in half an hour. And Rifftrax is on the stream. D:
Sergio_Scriptor: Hello!
seeing riftrax i see :)
/me waves at AJIsAwesome :)
/me continues crying
Fl00tersh41, yeah, normal unicorn magic, but like even what Trixie does seemed to impress the crowd, except the m6
suddenly whitrun
XD
Sergio_Scriptor: Hey there!
*whterun
13jarl balgruuf really let himself go
Klumzeedragon: hey :)
skyrim ref
oh my i haddnt see tht till now...
can use it without killing themselves
Vivix: Probably has more to do with Ponyville being an earth pony town
WindWhistler: *huggles* Nooooo crying! By the time you get back, it'll be movie time! And you can enjoy the movies with everypony!
hai everypony :)
/me googles Hansen
the day i realized these guys are nord, i shat a little brick
tounge hug?
hi Fl00tersh41 my viking friend :) how are you doing today ?
i mean, LOOK A THEM!
thelonepony: Hello!
Vivix: Twilly is constantly using spells for everything
Most unicorns dont seem to know much magic other than some basic spells.
Klumzeedragon: But I wanna watch RiffTrax! D: *WHINES*
Maybe, but I like to think that the average unicorn can't do much more than that because they don't train for it. And that like- Starswirled and Twi are special- you know
Sergio_Scriptor: I'm good
the architecture! the dude'S crown thing!
Sergio_Scriptor: You?
and all ponies know telekinsis
Quick_Thinker: only unicorns
maybe ponyville lays on a layline tht interferes with heavy magic use....
thelonepony: Howdy!
okay so i made a mistake
a layline realy XD
I like that the magic is so downplayed, its not like fixes everything magic
Fl00tersh41: good to,started to wonder recently that i need to find a cute nerdy girl to date :$ and have been very drepressed by not finding anyone :\
if layline, EXPLAIN TWILIGHT
WindWhistler: Youtube it later? 6_9
Sergio_Scriptor: Can't help with that I'm afraid
Sergio_Scriptor: I know that feeling.:(
vivix both times magic did fix shit (some pony had to have made the elments of harmony and if anything i think it was starswerl)
Klumzeedragon: RiffTrax isn't easy to find.
At least not free.
AJIsAwesome: :'( someday ...
the elements predate Starswirl, as far as I've gathered-
Well now I have to go. D:
simple, night and day need a break from time to time so Twilight is the seventh inning stretch...
Sergio_Scriptor: Yep, someday.:(
Dat theme
isohunt has a ton of Rifftrax
okay so then some pony had to make it
RIIIIIIIICOOOLAAAAA
Cya WindWhistler|AFK!
isohunt sucks
So much medicine
Vivix: Unicorns used to control the moon and the sun, seasons and such
they got deballed years ago
also the love fighint those wierd love hating things
WindWhistler: We'll miss you!
iso looks pretty good to me
i dont mean the changelings
Vivix: But that's all in unicorn cities where there are schools like Celestias for teaching Unicorns to use magic
Fishkipperer
Fl00tersh41, yeah, in a huge group. What I'm saying is that I think it's cool that it's--not as overplayed and huge and dramatic as magic in other shows. They're simple unicorns and normal ponies, and what Twi can do alone is pretty amazing
Vivix: Agreed.
Vivix: In a simple earth pony village I doubt you can get much formal training in magic
I wonder if there are other pony tribes besides the 3 that made equestria? maybe there are wild ponies that live in places like the everfree forest.
what training is there?
yeah, you'd probably have to travel out of the city to get schooling
pwnage
Playing the old man card
Rex_Mundi: Who knows?
Vivix: Hence why ponyville locals don't use magic as much
Celestias school for gifted unicorns, and probably some other unmentioned ones
with always brings me back to why we havent seen Sweetie bell use magic
Mininova got "deballed" but isohunt is still good at least in the US
seriously the only ponies we know who were specified in magic are Twi and Star
Rex_Mundi: i like to think that exist a race of ponies that live underground called the lanteans( latin to : exiled) :)
Xaiphafonese: Maybe she's supposed to be like Scootaloo.
Xaiphafonese: Shes not good at it
She's probably weak and young still, I like that she uses her mouth a lot
Yh
Vivix, I am sure you do
even when Twilight started learning, she was weak, as in that cutie mark episode. I think it just makes it cooler
Ryunosuke, ;__;
Lack of formal training I suspect
and after like maybe 10 years she is stil weak
in a way
punch them out
Elf jiitsu
Indeed
Cool fact. There are G1 ponies that have gews instead of eyes. And in a G1 comic it is explained that those ponies were once slaves whose eyes died and they replaced them with magic jewels so they can see again.
Hahahaha
waht
just like Sableye
Rex_Mundi: Well thats kind of creepy
Rex_Mundi: a little dark :\
Woah, that's pretty cool
I remember the gem eyed ponies
thats fuckin creepy for G1
Sup peeps! (And by peeps, I mean everypony)
Rex_Mundi: that would be great for Creepypasta :P
hi tSpark :)
hello
it probelt already is
Infested with Chtristopher Lees
There we go, now I'm the right handle :P
Lol
how do i change my nickname?
pony_275904: Use /nick
/nick [name]
Sergio_Scriptor: Shout out
./nick [nick]
Fl00tersh41 and Vivix: And dont forget that Twilight can only do so much magic is because her special talent is magic~ Other Unicorns can only do Magic pertaining to their special skill. Like Rarity can really only look for gems and do fancy magics like trimming up the tree branches.
thx\
hi Count-bleck :P
The real difference between Trixie and Trilly is talent
He looks a lot better
Twilly is all books and learning
That was a crazy-fast recovery
Fl00tersh41: so trixie is ntural talent ? :D
Fl00tersh41: And friendship!
Trixie has learned by practice with none of the theory
Fl00tersh41: And badass magic!
Klumzeedragon: Also, unicorns all know the basic levitation spell/telekinesis basically
so how is the magic abilities like say cutting branchs limited to that learn some other ways to use that skill creatively
Klumzeedragon, true, and Trixie's cutiemark seems to be illusion or show-spells, Magic should be limited for normal ponies, and- I think you'd find more talented ponies in those schools, that might also have multi-talent cutiemarks or marks relating to magic
jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa :[
Sergio_Scriptor I simply don't like LOTR, I'll be back later
Dat innuendo
Count-bleck: ok :P
otakon17: Aye. I didnt think I'd have to say that though. xD
notice my horrible commas
Bye Count-bleck
Sky Mall :D
Gotta love it
everypony to the SKY MALL
Trixie might have been unschooled, but we don't really know
13let him go he needs to hurry up and get to tomahna to steal a book
Vivix: well we will just have to wait to see maybe more magic shcools in the future :P
Klumzeedragon: If unicorns can't learn by reading spellbooks why are there whole libaries full of spellbooks?
i am new :)
In my head-canon, earth-ponies have another as-yet undiscovered kind of magic.
yeah
Yeah, G1 had its dark moments... something that they wont allow in todays shows.
Shizuka: What?
Welcome, pony_8435 :)
13guess nopony gets the reference .-.
Klumzeedragon: And schools for teaching magic
Myst 3 Exile
I think all ponies are said to have inate magic to their tribe
13except cypress
you head canon means diddly shit
Fl00tersh41: Spells created by other ponies
Shizuka: Sorry dear enope
Like, it's not even the same *kind* of magic as unicorns use. Sorta like the difference between mages and druids in WoW
where's waldo
then welcome to sunny bronystate pony_8435 be sure to buy our anti-buffer spray on the gift shop :P
13uncultured filly
Rex your forgetting the Lesson zero mental breakdown and the Wedding going bat shit crazy
Fl00tersh41: For those ponies with the gift of magic. Hence why they have such a strict entrance exam. ;)
thats pretty damn dark
otakon17: But any unicorn could learn magic that way, or there would be no point in the spell books
Several ponies probably have cutiemarks relating to magic
speaking of, I havent been on Uru live in a few weeks...I'll have some time on sunday, Shizu :)
I don't think Twi is the only scholar
meowmeowemew
13have not really touched it since either
like how we are going into indepth discussion based on magic that is explained in a small way
Lol
Who says all unicorns have magic? Have you ever seen all the background unicorns using magic?
It's the way of nerdism
Vivix Well it'd be silly to have an enterance exam for a field that only one pony is in :P
Quick_Thinker: Always happens, fandom looks deep into its source
pony_8435: Welcome!
soulrider they are background ponys for a reason
soulrider95: well they are unicorns,it's like a pegasus never flying :D
hello all.
soulrider95: The numerous remarks to general unicorn magic made by Twilly?
hi WallDives :)
they are there to stand there not pull hadokens and other crazy shit
if i may reference "magic kindergarden"
tSparx, that it would hee. And yeah, some unicorns are probably weaker, some stronger, some might not use magic a lot due to habit, just like people
I don't want to bring up another war, but i honestly like Celestia. Even though she isn't one of the most powerful Alicorns in Equestria in terms of magic, she is in terms of political stability. Sure, she likes to make jokes and have fun, but that makes her character more defined. She wants to have a little bit of fun everyone once in a while, and I don't blame her. Also, for people who say that she was being a troll when she didn't give Twilight
wall text
WallDives: Hello!
mm, horse stew
Sorry. Wall text.
13biiiiiiiill
Vivix: Yeah, agreed.
:$
AJIsAwesome, I like Tia for the same reasons...
AJIsAwesome, I completely agree
your end cut off though
Vivix: indeed :)
AJIsAwesome: Pretty sure she is the most powerful Alicorn, well normally
okay so where are the other Alicorns all we know is Crysalis and Luna so far
AJIsAwesome: Who says that Celestia isn't among the most magically powerful alicorns? She *raises the sun* everyday
I think she is crazy powerful, but that so are other beings like her
13everyone knows luna is best
I really don't like it when people say that they hate her when they don't give valid reasons.
Only reason Chrysalis won that one match was from stolen love
Sweetie Belle is best pony
Shizuka: Goes withou saying
Oi!
otakon17: THANK YOU!
Shizuka:Best answer as now
i be all powerful
stolen love and probably inate queen stuff
i agree with AjIsAwesome, to some degree
they cheated through cliche
Yh
No, an OC Alicorn that is all Black and red and Evil is best Alicorn6_9
Vivix: Celestia is the worf of Equestria
Rex_Mundi: -_-
woorf..star trek?
She gets beaten by any threat that comes along
Also, is Crysalis even really an Alicorn? The changelings aren't even ponies, are they?
Fl00tersh41: Lol
hehehe
Rex_Mundi, also cliche and blatantly Sueish.
Rex_Mundi, your OC is not best pony
To show it's dangerous
So do you guys think that exist more planets on the equestrian solar system,and if so is there alicorns to represent them ? and would they be more powerfull ? :|
ouch
i mean there a probely some other alicorns far from the current lands of Equestria (like say go further then the edge of the map saying dragons be here)
tSparx: Well they are pony like
Chrysalis isn't considered an alicorn unless you go by fanon, I think
tSparx, I wouldnt say they are ponies...
WallDives: yep!:P
or even equine.
Shes not an alicorn
but all we know about Changelings are from that one episode, and it's-- probably likely that they are not equines
Sorry for the wall text. I just don't like it when people hate things without giving an in-depth analysis.:$
So
its hard not to say something S3 related
AJIsAwesome: no problem :P
Sergio_Scriptor: Good question.
I wish I could type that fast.
REALLY REALLY HARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
your arguments seems fairly out of cannon so i dont care
Vivix: I would also question how much solid practice Celestia has at actually fighting
My theory is that Celestia and luna are special by Alicorn standards, but other lesser Alicorns exist, like Cadance.
The changelings just look like equines
Rex_Mundi: That's my headcanon too
Fl00tersh41, yyes, it is probably a very long time since there was a war
Rex_Mundi: Well you might be on to something
otakon17: i would say they are hibrids :\
I kind of wish to see Celestia and Luna's parents, though.
wiat is blueblood a alicorn?
And the chat exploded. :D I can't keep up with everypony anymore.
Rex_Mundi: Wait, Cadence has wings?
Quick_Thinker: No wings.
Rex_Mundi, yeah, in my personal belief Cadence is a winged unicorn, or a watered out normal alicorn, because she ages in Twilights flashbacks
no
LOTR :D
but I have unicorn magic
Beat cheeks Shadowfax! BEST CHEEKS!
hey everyone ^^
Quick_Thinker: GOD NO :|
blueblood is a unicorn
just saying, a powered-up Chrysilis isnt a good standard for Celestia's fighting prowess.
hello everypony
so I can escape from people trying to nibble on me
hi Cavale.
13so otakon17 you were checking out shadowfax's plot?
I totally missed that.
hi Cavale :)
13"best cheeks"?
but i thought blueblood was cadences brother
AJIsAwesome: That
Cavale: Hello!
AJIsAwesome, yeah, I think so
no
Yes he is
Hiya Cavale
WallDives: Agreed
DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
blueblood is a 'relative'
Who Blueblood is related to isn't said in the show, so we don't know
he was originally going to be 'duke blueblood'
Shizuka: No no, beat cheeks!
oh boy, people discussing the powers and skills of cartoon ponies
jaaaaaaaaaaaaa :[
blueblood is prince by marriage perhaps?
Quick_Thinker: Dun Dun Dunland!
13but you said best
AJIsAwesome: For all we know, Celestia and Luna's long levity is a simple magical trick
blueblood ewww must you speak that name
Eeyup Buytoast thats what fans do
Buytoast, welcome to the bronydom?
Buytoast: Yep. It's inescapable.:)
We're the new trekkies
:D
Vivix: Pretty sure they say Blueblood is Celestia's nephew.
We will discuss unicorn magic the way they discuss space engines!
here's a thought
Shizuka: The second time...:P a typo
Fl00tersh41: i prefer to belive they live the same as the sun and the moon age respective :)
they're only as powerful as the episode dictates
They do--don't they? Hm
WOAH
star trek was awesome
13uh huh suuuuuure
it's mindblowing, aint it
and so are ponies
Buytoast you no like then just leave makes it less annnoying in this room
which is why Q came over
hai everyone
Fl00tersh41: No, remember, the mane6 are all shocked to discover that Celestia is Luna's sister, even T-Sparx the magic scholar
Shizuka: I do not like plot!
lol watching cutie mark chronicles episode... pinkie's rock farm makes me lol so much.
13uh huh
13suuuuuure
Fl00tersh41: Doesn't seem like it'd be a *simple* magic trick, at least.
Buytoast: Tell that to Sonic fans.
bullshit
I died when Kevin said "crispity crunchity Anatevka"
I've never understood sonic fans
you can't tell anything to sonic fans
but they probably don't understand me
Shizuka: Dammit you're enjoying this too much.
hm
tSparx, true, so Luna was probably more or less forgotten,
The Sonic fandom... boy has the sonic fandom sunck
OneTrickPony: Hello!
What did they say in pilot intro? They did say 'sister' right?
Rex_Mundi: Agreed.:S
Rex_Mundi: Remember, we could be like that one day
Rex_Mundi: WHAT THE FUC IS A SONIC ?!-jontron reference
Vivix: Well what I'm saying is that it seems to suggest that no one realized Celestia was *that* old, that was my take on it when I saw the pilot anyway
im from denmark :S
OneTrickPony: Hello Minecraft friend!
tSparx, oh hey- yeah..hm
tSparx: Luna was probably just forgoten due to power politics
otakon17: As long as we are careful.
/me tries to say "Anatevka Anatevka, crispity crunchity Anatevka with a straight face"
otakon17: We'l be fine.
*We'll*
hiya Klumzeedragon
pony_8435: Welcome! Change your nick with /nick
Fl00tersh41: I think she was forgotten because she'd been locked up 10,000 years ago.
hehe
/me /nick like this
tSparx: Who?
tSparx: 1000
tSparx, 1000 years?
She was probably forgotten, replaced with a myth, and gone the way of many old things
im going to take a guess at a S3 episode is that fine with the admins?
how when 1000 years passed, even historical characteres begin to feel like fiction
tSparx: Celestia needed to consolidate power with herself, which is easiest is everyone isn't constantly asking where her co ruler is
What Vivix said
13schizophrenia could strike at any time
Oh was it a thousand?
13make sure you're immunized
im going to take a guess at a S3 episode is that fine with the admins?
tSparx, yeah one thousand
Quick_Thinker: I think that there are multple sonic fandoms, because sonic has different canons. The magazines, the games, the shows... Not all of them are so low.
Immunized I am!
Vivix: still why did her sister encourged the myth,and not just say the truth ? :\
Quick_Thinker no
Shizuka: But you can't immunize against that...
Rex_Mundi: Agreed.
13i used to have schizophrenia but we're okay now
XD
Eulshy your not an admin
Shizuka: :D
Sergio_Scriptor, not sure, she might not have, she might have just let the mortals do what they want, she seems to have done that a few times
arhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh :[
" Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban"
inb4 Meet the Shizu
ive been going Schizo for awhile i think.....get your shots now!
Sergio_Scriptor: Bc she didn't realize how much ponies still thought of her as nMM
Quick_Thinker, regardless say nothing about s3 guess or otherwise
Sergio_Scriptor: Because Twilight would have been focused on defeating Nightmare Moon than making friends.
that might be true too otakon17
Brad its a GUESS not stright up spoilers
Vivix: maybe she is not as powefull as she looks like then,if you folow that logic then :\
Just quoting the topic.
Quick_Thinker: Yeah, but Eulshy can read the topic of the channel. NO S3 convo
13gollum stop talking to the audience, we want to watch the movie
"Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban."
:_:
Quick_Thinker I think it's fine as long as you base none of it from known S3 material out
/me sighs.
Maaybe- but I'm thinking Celestia might at times hold back information or pull back, because medling is something she is done with
Gollum is such a tragic character
EonMaster: Word
Yes
in other news, otakon17, I dont see you getting kicked every 10 minutes.
I would kinda like to see a G3 Tirak. Get some more dark phantasy elements in the show and a little less 'slice of life' based episodes
fuck it im asking an actual admin
she might have been content with waiting for her sister, and--I don't know, it's hard to say when we don't see it in the show
WallDives: On iPod
But...smeagol the movie isnt over - we dont leave til the credits start
WallDives: Can't type that fast with thimbs
Quick_Thinker, but none of them are admins, they're chanops...
Thumbs... Dammit
Sergio_Scriptor: If she had been told that Nightmare Moon was coming back, she would have been focusing her attention on just nightmare Moon, not building a connection with her friends. Therefore, failing the mission.
/me snickers.
Vivix: so either she is not that powefull to actualy control stories and myths,or she has everything planned,everything that will ever happen she knows it :|
Brad making a guess on S3 will start a discussion
I am just sticking to the MOTD, w are frwoning upon S3 discussions, spoilers, guesses, or otherwise
Quick_Thinker: what would you like to ask an admin?
AJIsAwesome: true :\
Boil em. Mash em. Stick em in a stew
that if i can take a guess on a S3 episode
Sergio_Scriptor: She doesn't need to control everything, just what goes into the history books
Sergio_Scriptor, that might be, we don't reallyy know, but from her general attitude, Celestia might be very witihdrawn at times-
Campbells chunky cream of cronies
Sergio_Scriptor: Just saying. I'm not trying to force anything on you.
or hell maybe a S4 or S5
love that line stupid fat hobit
Taters! Whats taters?
Quick_Thinker, just don't say it?
13bet none of you saw that coming
singit!
otakon17: Potatoes?
that ... waht
PO TAT TO's
LOL
AJIsAwesome: no problem :)
hippster Sam GO!
hahaha :D
Shizuka: Nope nope :P
unz unz unz
beatnoxing :D
cause sharing it in here will lead to response that will lead to discussion
AJIsAwesome, I think that's why she never told Twilight the truth, or the truth to anyone in general, which might- be why she never said NMM is my sister Luna
Raw wriggling
I saw it coming from a mile away Shizuka! :D
and that's forbided
it was just so long ago that it might not helpful?
Ewwww
Quick_Thinker: you're looking for a bronystate mod then... admins are something else entierly
Where.in.the.world.is. Carmen Sandiego?
Vivix: Agreed.
Vivix: it's something only time will say to us :P we still know very few about equestria history,time will tell :)
fine i see your point
Shizuka: Please answer WallDives so that we can move on with our live
yeah
Quick_Thinker: we're much scarier
I didnt ask a question, tSparx.
omg :'(
ninjas
and all i wanted to do was make a guess :l
pony_8435: What's wrong?
Mi culpa I meant Qckthnkr
Vivix: yeah,but i bet there is still like many more pony races arround :P
So does most everypony in the ponyverse know that Luna was NMM? It seems to me that the mane6 arnt that well know and thus I dont think people know that the mane 6 defeated her.
Vivix: Didn't explain The Royal Pony Sisters origins
Oliphant
Quick_Thinker, but you already did it
in your head
but you want to share it
No it did not explain the origin, but it hinted at possible origins that we might use in fanon
and that'll lead to discussion
Rex_Mundi: She's the co ruler of the country
/me bans himself from his mind
Carmen Sandiego x Waldo :: Gives birth to the Uchiha Clan of the naruto series.
Rex_Mundi: There's a big stainglass window in Celestia's castle, and there was a major party in PonyVille after they did it
LadyCanary|wubwub, hello.
:3 Is Shizu streaming?
Hehe
the elephants betrayed them

Hiya WallDives
i like toy firetucks
SHIZU!!!
Rex_Mundi: It's got to make headlines when she just comes out of nowhere
13wubwub
Rex_Mundi, it doesn't seem that ponies in general knew that NMM was real, and might not have ever made the connection that NMM = Luna, that that is something only the m6 know, but not being secrets
clefairy clefairy <3
Hello, LadyCanary|wubwub.:)
ded
(I'm just reacting to things I see and hear)
Loot him!
Rex_Mundi: They probably hushed it up
Rex_Mundi: And just said the Mane6 defeated NmM and luna returned as a elresult
Des chat?
I think M6 might be well known outside of Ponyville, and that Ponyville is used to them, maybe, stain glass and party and all that
Eh?
Rex_Mundi: But did they not get a giant stained glass window and also have a ceremony in their honour for defeating both NMM and Discord? I just think that they're very modest and dont let the town treat them so special.
:o
it begins
Where'd my LotR go!?
huh
?
Where movie go?!
:D
INTERMISSION!
Bring back da movie!
WE MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
tSparx: But how many ponies see the stained glass window. Plus the party could have just been a welcome back for Luna coming back, maybe ponies diddnt know that Luna was NMM.
Klumzeedragon, yeah, I think so too
Klumzeedragon: Agreed.
WE MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
Intermission :P
time to play some ARMA
WE MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
Hiya Dken2021, GigabitHarmonie, LadyCanary|wubwub wub wun
FUCK YOU AI
Mini-intermission :D
ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGg
Damn my chat
Hello otakon17!
Id like to see an episode with pinkie in the city.
My favorite
Vivix: When Rarity wanted to be famous in canterlot she didn't simply mention who she was
ohello otakon17
My chat is going nuts
Rex_Mundi: THat seems less likely, because then the halloween ep, so many people didn't sem to realize Luna was back
Brad__: that would be AWESOME :)
Seriously, is that a sign Rarity was carrying?
Scout vs Witch?
Lol
/me gets shot out of plane and curses the AI and his team mates for leaving him to die
Sergio_Scriptor, :D
in the nightmare episode we see most ponies react to Luna with fear, but that might be a reaction to NMM having been there the year before
This is gonna be good
scout vs witch
how've you been otakon17
O.o
well im out
Dat baseball.
alexxm: Okay
ths'll be good
Vivix: And that was after the second time they saved the country
Hiys xmasmare
?
Fluttershy, he's talking to you.
hey otakon17
Hello, GigabitHarmonie.:)
Bonk!
Vivix: The mane6 just ain't getting any fame for that
Tihs again
scout outruns zombies
Hello AJIsAwesome!
SUP BITCHES ITS THE SCOUT
1,11Good afternoon.
Is this that new Wii U game?
Fl00tersh41, as if she doesn't recognize her own fame and worth
Lol
Hey Silverscreen :P
GigabitHarmonie: You still taking the Bronystate question of the week?
ftw
Silverscreen: Hello!
lol
If only
Scout!!
how you doing Silverscreen
o, ok
oh YEAAAAAH
Tovler: SFM.
AJIsAwesome: Until the show, yes, so send it in!
This is great
dem shoes
1,11I'm alright. Sorry to suddenly bring this up, but I won't be here for this week's BMN.
Left for Dead meats Team Fortress 2?
Fund it
GigabitHarmonie: Got it, thank you!:)
lol
Silverscreen: :(
Lol
Vivix: She could still have mentioned the whole "saved the country twice" thing at some point in that episode, but she never did
Silverscreen: WHAT?!:O
how come Silverscreen
SO much epic :$
im batan
Silverscreen: That sucks man
Shizuka: This is hilarious
The banshee talks?
Fl00tersh41: Well, she would have amassed more fame than she realy needed.
im batman
Fl00tersh41, she could have, but like the Princess, it seems like she did not think it was... impressive, since it was her. You know? Some peple are like that, they can't see their own worth so they make up things instead
1,11Heading home for Labor Day Weekend. Won't be back until Monday night.
Silverscreen: I don't know you, but that doesn't sound good. We'll miss you!
this is gunna be good
tSparx: Line from Army of Darkness
Bonk.
how fameous they actually are is a bit hard to say too
Damn FUND THIS!
This looks very well made.
Bravo.

I see Scout is taking the 300 approach to fighting
EspyLacopa: SFM
dang this is awesome
So goood. OH GOD NO NOT THOSE
Aren't you going to grab your bat, Scout?
Headcrab zombie!
Lol
Vivix: none of the mane 6 are getting any fame for saving the country
:D
lol
da fuq
Goddamn...headcrabs D8
I think Derpy just keeps losing the newspapers, and that's why they aren't known outside Ponyville :P
tiuchdown
Hahahahahahahahaha /D
a bit too much slo-mo though
whats this? Oldboy parody?
Oh wow :D
Fl00tersh41: i blame the terrible equestria media :|
Vivix: my guess is that it's simply not a big deal
Good ol Headcrab-Zombies!
Well the stain glass gives them some fame, but how well known that is outside of the palace, we haven't been shown
still good nonetheless
die hunter
wait that sounds like its from the star was sound effeccts
Batter up!
Sergio_Scriptor: That would be Celestia's fault
what this Sfm call?
She's the ruler after all
lik a boss
Lol
Fl00tersh41, possibly, yeah. We don't know how far Discord had reached before he was stopped, for instance- but that was a bigger known thing than NMM
hax
HOME RUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
like a ball
I think Scout vs Witch
i'm calling hax
thelonepony: Scout vs. Witch
I am so faving this
at least from what the infobar says
:)
the Gnome
13it's not on youtube
Dream
was in the backround
xd
See, i dont thnk most ponies know what really happened and dont know the mane 6 did anything. Nightmare moon showed up, then she vanished and luna returned and there was a party for that. Thats what most ponies know i think. Maybe they are afraid that nightmare moon and luna are the same thing and that they shouldnt piss her off or shell go evil on them again/
Hi
Shizuka: You sure?
Fl00tersh41, it may be because the Equestrian state is comunist and service that saves the nation is expected
Shizuka: Dammit!
Awesome dream
Dat dream
BAHAHAHAHHA
13Vordox: vimeo or direct download only, the guy says youtube screwed up audio sync
Crap
Hio everypony
Ah
lol
Dat sfx
:D
aww
Lol
Xaiphafonese: Or the entire country is full of ungrateful wretches
Iain: Hello!
Great ending too
oh, reasonable, youtube kinda does mess up some videos
all of my yeses thrown at the screen
Iain: Hey there!
Where's part two?!
Rex_Mundi, yeah, that sounds plausible. I think the reason they were so terrified of Luna, was her grown size, and NMM still being fresh in memory for Ponyville, plus how they are not familiar with that princess
EspyLacopa: Not made yet
Plus, Luna does come across as a bit scary
WE MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
ello Iain
And railings.
Fl00tersh41...or tht
Seriously, is that a sign Rarity was carrying?
It's been awhile since I've been here
must construct well PAY ME THEN BITCH
AJIsAwesome: No, it's more railings.
AJIsAwesome: A railing
Shizuka: Oh my the ending Dun dun dun's remind me of the weird Celestia face from Ponies the Anthology.
Ok.
Bruce Valanch
Lol
Iain how are ya?
"the punch has been spiked" didnt expect that one.
Aaaaaaaaah! lotr seizure!!
breast much larger? yep, it's up to the correct place now.
BRB.
Scottish hams
Great how bout you Dken2021
They must be extray hammy, otakon17.
They are the descendants of BRIAN BLESSED
been good Iain
yes
BWIAAAN BWESSIDH! HOAHOAHOA
Close your eyes, close your eyes, think of nothing tonight
That guy is awesome
:D
Okay off to check yt brb
Is Aragon having a wet dream?
i want to dream with Twilight :P
SLEEP!
What i want to know, what exactly happened to let NMM escape? Did Celestia do it so the mane6 can use the elements on her to turn her back to good? Or did NMM escape on her own? Or did something ells release her?
i wanna dream with spitfire
I liek bundt cake
Sergio_Scriptor: It was the planets alligning.
Hai everypony :)
Rex_Mundi, the curse/banishment might ahve been set as temporary- but the lore says "the stars will aid in her escape" but who or what controls that-
I thought it was the stars aligning?
13zzzz
Rex_Mundi: probably something else,if you remeber the 6 stars ? probably other ponies with other elements
is this abridged
I'm gonna skip out on BMN; don't like the movies, and it's too much chat.
13not sure which is worse, this scene, or the entirety of star wars episode 2
Now...KISS
Iain: it's riftrax so yeah...you can call it that :P
:D
13hear hear bill
SW episode 1
pimp shirt powers activate
It says "The Stars will aid in her escape," but they never explain what that means
Sergio_Scriptor: Or stars. :D But she was able to use them as a bridge back.
so how do guys think of season 3 coming up?
Rex_Mundi, it is possible- that Celestia had a hoof in it when they say the stars will aid in her escape, she definitely seems to know that it was going to happen then
Dammit not there
ah more riftrax?
Iain: I'm not allowed to think about it on this channel.
Iain no discussing S3 apparntly
Klumzeedragon: i bet it was gannon and the seven mages :P
okay
Iain: Not out loud anyway :P
Celestia is a mastermind
13we have a strict no spoilers policy
*ganon
13even speculative
Sergio_Scriptor: It all make sense now! Damn that Ryu!
oh now you tell me
funny Shizu
13enough people don't want to be spoiled about details
But
Speculation is awesome
She says that she *saw* the signs of NMM's return, not that she did it. But, y'know, tollestia and all
she place her pieces strategically so she won't need to be directly involved
Celestia is such a chessmaster if you pay attention to everything she does. such a master manipulater. I bet she could pull off zanatos gambits.
Rex_Mundi: Thanatos
Xanatos^
trollestia
Season 3 is kind of like the forbidden topic for now
otakon17: Speculation can lead to false rumours, or people thinking they've been spoiled and getting upset about it
master manipulter exactly HOW
Rauru**
:D troll jumping out!
13false rumors make for trouble
Doesn't want Season 3 spoilers. Hangs out with bronies several hours a day.
Bye lain
otakon17: no, Xanatos
13just look at EQD posting a fake tweet yesterday
hehe
bye
lawl at the EQD event
elf
tSparx, she said that specifically?
lawl at the elf
13EQD is what happens when you don't crack down on spoilers
Shizuka: Do you still have the screencap?:D
Ooooh its mr theyre takin the hobbits to Izengard
EQD is what happens when you let a trixie obsessed dragon fucker have power
Dont let the pig kill people
13a scout? CALL THE WITCH!
Vivix: Celestia said that, "I saw the signs of NMM's return," when she exlains to T-Sparx what she's doing at the battle-site
AJIsAwesome: I thought it was Sumica who had the screencap.
Mmm- yes!
Oh gawd Buytoast that's going a bit far, even though it's true
/me takes less classes at school to run a MLP blog.
Buytoast: poor seth :D
that looks nothing like skyrim orcs
That might mean that it was the elements that had limited the banishment, but it might still mean that Celestia had set the time somehow, but the former is much cooler and sadder
alfopony: Different fiction
SQUIRREL!
I saw the actaul movie
Go Eowyn, show they people the meaning of haste
MEDIC!
how deadly is Legolas with that bow?
serious question
HAX!
Quick_Thinker: Well, she sent twilight to Ponyville to make friends, the town where all the ponies whose cutie marks are connected thanks the filly RD first sonic rainboom. The power of friendship was used so the Elements of Harmony that were used to restore Luna to good that she KNEW would be released and appear in ponyville. She used twilight like a chess pice.
Octovlerfest. Woo Hoo
00,10you meen this? http://screensnapr.com/v/hDcIur.jpg
13hai sumica
Where would you be after FiM is finished?
Dken2021: it's like a demoman with a frying pan O_o
Hiya Sumica
00,10hi Shizuka and otakon17
CrimsonPhoenix: In a ditch somewhere, sobbing.
hio Sumica
tSparx, pathetic
Yes I have Sumica
CrimsonPhoenix: Nothing pathetic about crying.
Legolas is such a kill stealer.
Sergio_Scriptor that deadly huh?
Dken2021: yep :D
ha labor!
tSparx, about a show that met what every single show did before?
Rex_Mundi: I wouldn't say that she used twilight as a chess piece. She probably could've taken care of the situation herself, but it probably would've involved killing her or banning her into the depths of space.
Rex_Mundi, yeah, Celestia knows a lot more than she lets on about that, but seemingly did not have the same knowledge when Chrysalis happened. It might also have a been like.. "If this don't save my sister, I might aswell loose it all" or something
CrimsonPhoenix: About one of my favorite shows ending.
Poor Gimli
Sumica huh, didn't know the hub had a twitter called leatherneckpony
CrimsonPhoenix: I cry at commercials, man, crying about *anything* isn't pathetic.
Poor poor Gimli.
Rex_Mundi: Plus, she wants her sister back. Can't forget that.
Squashed under an orc and a warg
yes
Crying isn't pathetic but if all your life you're going to cry about a show
:D
Her sister is probably her closest companion
That both reek to the heavens
No, squashed under an orc and -two- wargs.
then you'll need to re-evaluate your life
no not the direwolf
EspyLacopa: Ouch
Don't take everythign at face value
CrimsonPhoenix: I didn't say all my life.
alexxm: Evil smelly dire wolves
Vivix: Yet... she still lives on the moon.
Rex_Mundi: She loves her sister, and she was waiting for her to stop being jealous of Celestia.
Hmm, not sure if Celestia could have beaten NMM. We dont know how powerful she was.
CrimsonPhoenix: But I promise you I will cry after the series finale.
and I said after the show ends not when it will
Also, anyone here ever read The DM of the Rings?
Vivix: i mean only luna and celestia can live forever,i lived forever and saw everyone i loved dieing in my front i would like to keep in touch with the other guy that lives till eternity :|
13a great comic
otakon17: I did
yeah
AJIsAwesome: is that why Celestia told the people of Equestria her sister was a cannibal?
13darths and droids is good but it's dragging on too long
lov me some ebay time
I would have pushed him
Rex_Mundi: Not on her own, not only that she didn't want to destroy her
AJIsAwesome: You know, that whole Nightmare Night thing
Fl00tersh41, that was a myth spun by ponies, not Celestia
Fl00tersh41: Probably a folk story, not Celestia's story
Fl00tersh41: That was Pinkie pie.:S
well, as far as we know
Fl00tersh41: No that was myths and legends about NmM
:S
plus NMM and Luna might be seperated enough that Celestia did not think it mattered
But she could have set the record straight
Fl00tersh41: Plus, that was Superstition.
Fl00tersh41: True
13it's minas tirith minus minas tirith
I would totally live on the moon if I had the ability to commute from moon to earth in a few minutes.
Woah, rifftrax LotR
plus of course, they were all surprised when NMM turend out to be Luna
Fl00tersh41: Assuming that she knew about Ponyville customs
Fl00tersh41: There will always be superstition anf conspirices.
Its only a model
But she let that little story fester for a thousand years
13i spy a shamrocs
otakon17: :D
Shizuka: hmm wut?
HEY DENIS. THERE IS SOME LOVELY FILTH OVER HERE
how long is this?
Fl00tersh41: Maybe Tia thought it was funny
too long
Iain, like 3 hours
Fl00tersh41: We have no way of knowing how old that story is, could've only been around for like 40 years for all we know
jeez
AJIsAwesome: But is "my sister is a cannibal" the kind of superstision you would ignore?
Iain: more 1 hour and 26 minutes :)
Lain another 1h25m
no I think NMM and Luna was considered seperate enouh that celestia did not care
otakon17: I wouldn't go that far.:D
:) only 1 hour
Hiya DeathStar how are ya dear?
tSparx: It was around long enough have become a traditional festivity
lain 1h25m
Maybe NMM was a cannibal?
oh
Fl00tersh41: Still, even if she told them, there are people in Equestria that don't like Celestia.
otakon17: I'm good ^_^
Yep
ello DeathStar
Iain dammit that I looks like an l
13he fell
Fl00tersh41: Plus, it's a ghost tale.
GigabitHarmonie: Hey
Fl00tersh41: And? That could be very young
Shizuka: Off a cliff
13what, on a banana peel, over a cliff, into a pile of hay WHAT?
Fl00tersh41: I just don't think she wanted to keep bringing up that she was sisters with NMM...
Hello ShadowQuill.
Fl00tersh41: Kwanza's about that old
Fl00tersh41: THey took it to heart rather than a harmless joke. It's their fault.
dramatic music7
Lol Shizuka
you know
everybody loves dwarves
gtg, probably catch you guys at movie time
dwarves ... make
nevermind
Prick: Especially the women
he sounds like the engiener
Ryunosuke: Weapons
men like dwarf womens
if they shave the beards
I wonder why I liked these movies that much when younger
spectacle
a bomb
13and then grima wormtongue dropped a candle in it and saruman blew up
13the end
Kanoom
I still say that NMM and Luna was considered seperate enoguh that Celestia did not interfere, with how even Twilight was shocked at Luna, and so forth-
Fl00tersh41: Well, maybe the modern-day Nightmare Night is too.
Rex_Mundi: "Hot Plot"?:S
Fl00tersh41: I'm not saying you're wrong
NMM was... an aspect of Luna, like Vader and Anakin
thats how I see it
Fl00tersh41: I'm saying we don't have enough info to say either way. Like a lot of this stuff, admittedly, but
Shizuka: If only it were that easy to get rid of him!
tSparx This is Sparta
AJIsAwesome: Its part of the joke. lol, the look on AJs face
tSparx: The modern day NMM was in abook from olden times
Id vote for Sarumon
My guess would be that NMM stories have been around since she tried to take over
Hot Plot: Part Duex was better
:p
Fl00tersh41: You mean NMN? I meant the story behind it.
Sarumon 2012
Rex_Mundi: Lol dat AJ face
Brb
Saruman is a poor man's Sauron.
this has a great plot. and no that that kind you might think of :P
Ryunosuke, yeah I think so too, but in the minds of the ponies, they did not know NMM is Luna, so why would Celestia attempt to fix it, linking Luna to NMM?
Fl00tersh41: That NMM'll eat ya
Sarumon>Romney
Vivix: how much longer must he extend this discussion ?it's ridicilous we obvously have not enought information to make up our minds :| in a bit we will start talking if flim & flam wore realy scamers and not just honest ponies trying to make a living :\
Sergio_Scriptor: Nothing wrong with discussing headcanon
has he been smoking?
Meh, discussing nerdism is fun
like how Yoda didnt discern Anakin vs Vader? :)
ppossibly
Rex_Mundi Ron Paul
Sergio_Scriptor: Be glad this isn't #StarTrek, talk about speculation xD
I'm not good at Star Wars history
tSparx: True.
(I don't know if that's a real channel here on ponychat, but you know what I mean)
dat old man river
tSparx: i agree,it is fun,but it just lasts forever XD and also yeah,you are right,thank god it's not a wars vs Trek site :D
thing is discussing this is fun because it must make sense with the information we are given- it's a passtime
:D
hehe
tSparx: The problem with your headcannon, is that "NMM being cannibal is a new thing" is just as much of an assumption as assuming it's old
Vivix: yeah :)it is fun sometimes :P
suddenly MLP shipping
But since NMM stories would have been around since NMM tried to take over
I have lost a bit track of what the point is right now though
Wouldn't the gist of them have been set down back then?
Vivik: But even though she never really linked NMM with Luna, people still knew she was NMM on Lunar Eclipse. 6_9
All we can really do is present possibilities, and argue their merits, but we're not gonna reach a solid conclusion one way or another, 'cause it's headcanon
Random, but I think the ponies would smell good.
13zzzzzz
he's not? aww
Rex_Mundi: i bet twilight smells like wild berries :)
they actually smell like leek
Klumzeedragon, hmm.. I'd have to rewatch the episode- but it might be the visual similarity to the statue?
Rex_Mundi: Maybe those ponies, but real ponies smell worse than normal horses
lauren faust told me
Stop falling asleep Shizuka!
you know
Horses smell great, never smelled a pony
These commentors are very political
I have a question
wonder if pinkie smells like cotton candy?
Shizuka: stop tempting me to link video link :I
Luna does acknowledge it being an insult to her though
You know... if you want. :$
Dken2021, maybe the toy.
when a filly leaves a dooor open, and their elders say "What, were you born in a barn or something?"
:p
Ryunosuke, hehehe
Am i the only one seing Byzantine influences with the arctecture
GigabitHarmonie: The shows are on Saturday, right?
DAT TEAR CLICHE.
We should set up a podcast that just discuss these things on ad length
Rex_Mundi: dont worry,you are not the only one :) im not an expert,but i can recognize some of it :P
Rex_Mundi Its kinda easy to tell that
Vivix: We should :)
Ryunosuke: They say nooooooooo, I was born in the ponyville general hospital by Dr. Horse.
Hasbro has something pretty amazing going on.... a group of people with money wanting to buy their toys.
Cat sleeping infront of monitor, powersave turned itself on *blind
Vivix: I'd volunteer for that, set up a topic ahead of time so that we can research, and respectfully lay out the possible headcanons, I'd love that!
/me 13yawns
Vivix: daw :3 that is so cute
Brad__: Its just your usual brand name loyalty
13can we hurry up and get to the swordfights..
Brad__ I know, have you seen the auctions for plushies?
13this movie and pacing... eesh..
For a minute there, I thought that woman had snot dribbling from her nose.:D
hai everypony
Dken2021, yes I have, some prices are pretty nuts...
ello AJ
tSparx what are you guys debating?
Shizuka: This novel and pacing, amirite?
ji AJ :)
i'd want her to moon me
If only this was the extended cut.
But im shameless in saying I might, down the road, spend that kind of money,....
And this is why Agent Smith hates Humans so much
AJ: Hello!
Shizuka: That's why there's the random dialouge to kind of make it better?
cincinnati chili
my name WAS AppleJack The One And Only but... apperantly it was already in use
Malk: We're talking about various possibilities behind NMM and her perception by the ponies
tSparx, it would be fuun, and yeah sleepy cats are the cutest Sergio_Scriptor
chicago skyline chili < all other chilis
rather >
AJ: No it's not. Not now.
tSparx NMM?
AJ: Try again.
:O
Sauron > Saruman > Saruraruaruman
Malk: Nightmare moon
Rarity probobly smells good.
Malk: And you missed the giant discussion about unicorns and magic.
tSparx you mean luna?
Rex_Mundi: probably :P
Malk: No, I mean Nightmare Moon, we're not really talking about Luna
sparta!
Malk- Oh, and G1 ponies with Gewls for eyes.
Rex_Mundi i think she yould smell like freash wached cloth
Dr. Doom has Doombots, not Doomettes -_-
Malk: I mean yeah, can't really talk about one without the other, but we've been focusing on her tenure as NMM
I think fluttershy would smell like a zoo
yeah the NMM part
Dken2021: God, not the ape house, I hope!
Applejack would smell like sweat and apples
it would be fun to talk about the xmas sode too, origin and all that, but I haven't seen that episode recently-
IIRC that map came from the books
yeah
also, dinner! brb darlings!
brb
tSparx ok I think Nightmare Moon is Blue
i got washing to do fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Considering that they take baths, I'm pretty sure they don't smell bad.:D
Enjoy Vivix!
ok,so in the matter of the flim & flam bros,i think they wore actual decent guys,the whole taking over sweet apple acres was just their way to make a living,they dont have a home,i think that the apple family wore the real jerks on this case :\ what do you guys think ? :)
Tonight, the moon is blue
13SPOI
spoi?
Rex_Mundi: I'd know what you meant.
AJ and AJIsAwesome who is the real AJ?
dunno
Sergio_Scriptor: That was my reading of it yes
goood diner Vivix :P
Hobbit ninja!
but we got some AJseption going on
Rex_Mundi its ponymas
dat short people joke
Sergio_Scriptor: Technically, they were trying to steal Sweet Apple Acres customers.
BWUUUUUU N
Fl00tersh41: i know right :)
Sergio_Scriptor I guess, they were salesmen
AJIsAwesome: it was the applefamily that refused to make a co-business with them anyway :|
AJIsAwesome: The apple clan couldn't provide as much cider as their customerswanted
lol
apple clan XD
clan'
Flim and Flam diddnt have any apples of their own.
Sergio_Scriptor: If they made a better offer, I'm pretty sure they would've agreed.
This sounds like stuff I would say while watching LOtR
Sergio_Scriptor: Aye, they were just business men, yet the Apple Family couldnt agree to the terms.
AJIsAwesome: But why should the apple clan's monopoly in ponyville be unchallanged by anyoen
Sergio_Scriptor: I mean seriously, 75-25?
AJIsAwesome: they never intended to steal their costumers,they wante to share the profits,they wore real nice guys,it was the apple family proud :\
lol ponyville economics
but you see...
RD kinda made things worst
hey everypony i found a Portal 2 map called Friendship is Magic
Sergio_Scriptor: Maybe, but their name Flim and Flam are paroding the word Flimflam, which is scam or hoax.
Sergio_Scriptor: The apple family made all the profits to keep their farm over the winter. if they didnt make enough profit off the Cider... they would have lost the farm. THAT is why they refused.
AJIsAwesome: They never even haggled about the percentages, 75/25 was just the opening big
*bid
and its coop
Hey not true
i wonder if any pony was thinking of monorail during the flim flam song
It's also a Music Man parody, and the music man was unquestionably a jerk
If Flmi and flma had their own land,THEN they shoudl be considered a menace to the apple family,but yes i can see your and Klumzeedragon point of view :)
Kill Smeagle now!
damn bungess
Do it, you'll save so much time!:|
*Smeagol*
Trust master!
This certainly is not a trap!
EspyLacopa: To be fair, he wanted him to be fine.
