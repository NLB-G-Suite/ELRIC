but hES SOO CUte i couldnt doiu thatght
never been to carls JR.
aww man, I just realized this awesome restaurant I went once as a kid only has three locations
awww
I've only read 2 fics but then i've only been watching the show for about 2 weeks
ik
FTW=for the win
I'm not even sure I want to read fanfics.
the 2nd was MLD
MLD :/
13anyone recognize the music
has anyone read "the powers of harmony"? its really good
13map 31 doom 2
13now this isn't
ive never read a fic and ive been watchINGSSD SINCE APRRRIL
I kinda wished MLD was a bit longer
The only one I was slightly disturbed by was Cheerlie's Garden
And I don't have any intention of reading... THAT fic
What's MLD stand for?
you know which
SpadeMagness whats it about?
i was highly disturbed by scootaloos diares, nut yet i still read the whole thing
Spade please
รรป
0,14...what song is this?
It's hard to explain...
It is... sad
to say the least
why not
/me Returns from shower
because it hasn't discovered shift yet
Its poorly structured wish fufillment that is extremely creepy once you think about it
I don't read those kinds of fics. It ruins the image of the character, IMO.
I don't think it has to ruin anything
as long as you remember it's just a fic
TF2?
Was an interesting mod
To bad it came out at the same time as TF2, no one noticed it.
this is TF2 right?
13sb does
i'll join if you got a slot
that is just... *creepy*
Watching best pony killing worst pony
Anyway.
Dat weapon swithch

IMO best fic is Rainbow factory
Spade lol same here
Because I just left.
XD
13SuperBrony64: coming?
*at*
I admit I had to keep reminding myself 'it's not canon' while reading
That's why I suggested normal fics.
should i get some keys in tf2?
Well, it succeeded in that definition xP

/me grabs his crowbar; just in case
hehehe
Yeah-
05thats not the issue
05the issue is the porn adds
When I was a kid, finding porn was like finding a treasure in the woods. Now it's everywhere
05which is why we encourage adblock
Faith in humanity is slowly leaving me
That example D:
We were kids! and we DID find it in the woods
http://derpy.me/BfMBZ
hehe
Reminds me of the time when I was young I said I was gonna find treasure in my backyard
I just ignore it
05well i had my first snaps at the age of 3
05i also played doom at that age
o.o
05i turned out all right

I played doom at age..5 I think?
Wolfestein 3D is the best FPS in the world.
I played GTA at 8
Wolfenstein*

Games where just about all kid friendly then
I still remember that you character farted and burped when you pressed "Tab":D
one of the first games I played was two dinosaurs beating eachother up on an amiga

But in all honesty i played GTA III at nine.

Really? I've never actually head someone say 'Mate' like that. :/
English chavs say mate as well

I like how in the uk they say housemate instead of roomate
Makes more sense, 'Housemate'.
as a slang for friend, anyway
Yeah. Right. >_>
Yaay!

Didn't they send apple truckloads of coins?
it'll be contested

0,5Hey how come there's no reticle?
Saxxy?
0,5How are you s'posed to hipfire with no reticle? :/
But seriously though, Castro aint that bad really, lots of people blame him for his country being poor. But there are plenty of poor as dirt capitalist countries that have it much worse than Cuba.
You know who's worse than Castro?
Kim Jung Il
or was it a tsunami?
North Korea is pretty much the worst country ever.
Communism
heh, north Korea never had communism

what's Wrek's rad metre sitting at?
lol
just a point :D
hey everypony :)
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
It is a girly name, but I like girly things so- yeah

Yeah, it makes up for all the other things

Damnit spotify! Browsing failed

I got free premium via phone company
Sonova.

He left? aww
He went to play TF2 but he's still here
Gonna go play TF2, you guys have fun

My mind was blown of stereotypes
lol
yeah-
It's called stereotypes
A excuse to see something as negative
there is no escape
Of coarse, the Furries have it the worst when it comes to steriotypes....
can i somehow change my Password for my name?
I feel like racial sterotypes are worse
klrpwny73 pls.
oh cool wreks streamin
u no nthng
<3
like most places, yeah
Does that rad meter go from left to right, or right to left?
Right to left I think
some gun mods, and someone working on a total conversion
Fuck
fanatics are the spooky ones, and the loud ones that represent the fandom
But how?
Or likc the pony toy asses
hehe
I can't appreciate a huge hunk of duty
oh biy, dragonwars for b-movie
no, not most, some- didn't he say that?
pegasisters go in there too
I know MOST but I am in that catergory am I not?
and just becasue some one is a steriotype doesnt mean there a bad person
depends on the stereotype though...
i think i came back to the right kind of discussion B)
of course, bad things happen, and once you accept that, it won't hurt as much
"All Canadians are half-bear axe murderers" is not a stereotype
hehe
lol
on yt
All germans are Jew killing Warlovers... a Stereotype I have too face way too often on the Web
thats horrible
05if swearing is immature, then why is it reffered to as adult language?
I don't even want to cry...
Honestly swearing helps expressing yourself thought not pleasantly, it's a way to express yourself
being Mature is a sign of self hate and stupidity
How does that CS luis quete go? The desire to be grown up is a sighn of immaturity?
As did I
It's a way to lack use of vocabulary and use fuck or shit for anything in a conversation
:3
trรธnder here, tons of swearing here, but I hardly swear anymore
be mature when the need arises, other wise, have fun like children
รธ
wat
o.o
"Jรฆvla hรธtta oppe derre fanes skau hรฆlvett, sku dratt se ut pรฅ den jรฆvla sjรธn med dere helvettes bรฅtn'"
is someone bitching that swearing is immature?
*hugs vivix*
WUT.
Thanks a lot guys. Much appreciated.
english here, i only swear around my friends/people i feel comfortable around
I thought it was you lol
FUCK
Let's keep swearing. Nothing wrong with that. Lol. >_>
^
well no shit
/me sighs
:/
I think "damn" is the wors word I use :/ ... I just have no need for the other words :/
I say fuck as an exaggerated joke sometimes
like that?
yeah
yeah
i think that swearing just for no reason is fucking stupid and fucking ponitless
i only ever swear in public in japanese, cause i know a few in japanese
Fookin prawns!
well... I would swear in different languages to be weird and nonsensical again XD
good thing too, it has all the cash for my bass in it
I got 2000 dollars on it after paying bills, thanks to having lost it
bankcard, I don't have credit on it, but it's easier to say
A credit card is handy if you treat it wisely
I had a Debit Card.
the only loan I have is studenet loan
HAHA Student loan.
/me licks Jmo's face
i don't need a student loan, education is free in england :3
hehe it is here too
but college is not
college is too :P
here it depends on the college
Don't lipa cost like thousand of thousands of euro?
Books!
Twilight
idk, i don't live in liverpool :P
I think schools like that cost money since they aren't government owned, I think LIPA costs quite a bit
but i don't need to worry about the rest of the world for a while, i'm still in high school
Fairy oddparents is pretty fun at times

He's got some decent ideas. But his fanbase is more overzealous than any I've seen.
whats OWS
Most of his good policies are going through Congress anyway

Good afternoon my little ponies! :)
13Vivix: be thankful, american politics is.... brr
hehe
Good evening everypony.
Dat march theme
and I don't
OWS didn't have anyone in charge and they had no goals. They were just attention whores.
Good thing that hobbits don't smell like manflesh, then, otherwise that'd be a false positive
13gotta give the orcs credit, they smell our heroes even though they're like a day ahead or more
13Fl00tersh41: right..... good point
13well, presumably they bathed in lorien
/me Pinkie_Pie is best room
they're taking the hobbits to isanguard

it makes the view from outerspace hilarious

pwnage
Playing the old man card
Mininova got "deballed" but isohunt is still good at least in the US
She's probably weak and young still, I like that she uses her mouth a lot
Lack of formal training I suspect
and after like maybe 10 years she is stil weak

The real difference between Trixie and Trilly is talent
That was a crazy-fast recovery

everypony to the SKY MALL
Trixie might have been unschooled, but we don't really know
13let him go he needs to hurry up and get to tomahna to steal a book
In my head-canon, earth-ponies have another as-yet undiscovered kind of magic.
yeah
Myst 3 Exile
I think all ponies are said to have inate magic to their tribe
13except cypress
you head canon means diddly shit
Like, it's not even the same *kind* of magic as unicorns use. Sorta like the difference between mages and druids in WoW
where's waldo
Several ponies probably have cutiemarks relating to magic

Sorry. Wall text.
13biiiiiiiill
:$
13everyone knows luna is best
Oi!
Shizuka:Best answer as now
they cheated through cliche
woorf..star trek?
Also, is Crysalis even really an Alicorn? The changelings aren't even ponies, are they?
hehehe
To show it's dangerous
ouch
i mean there a probely some other alicorns far from the current lands of Equestria (like say go further then the edge of the map saying dragons be here)
or even equine.
Shes not an alicorn
but all we know about Changelings are from that one episode, and it's-- probably likely that they are not equines
Sorry for the wall text. I just don't like it when people hate things without giving an in-depth analysis.:$
its hard not to say something S3 related
I wish I could type that fast.
REALLY REALLY HARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
My theory is that Celestia and luna are special by Alicorn standards, but other lesser Alicorns exist, like Cadance.
The changelings just look like equines
I kind of wish to see Celestia and Luna's parents, though.
no
LOTR :D
but I have unicorn magic
Beat cheeks Shadowfax! BEST CHEEKS!
just saying, a powered-up Chrysilis isnt a good standard for Celestia's fighting prowess.
hello everypony
I totally missed that.

Just quoting the topic.
13gollum stop talking to the audience, we want to watch the movie
:_:
/me sighs.
Maaybe- but I'm thinking Celestia might at times hold back information or pull back, because medling is something she is done with
Yes
she might have been content with waiting for her sister, and--I don't know, it's hard to say when we don't see it in the show
But...smeagol the movie isnt over - we dont leave til the credits start
Thumbs... Dammit

But
Speculation is awesome
She says that she *saw* the signs of NMM's return, not that she did it. But, y'know, tollestia and all
Celestia is such a chessmaster if you pay attention to everything she does. such a master manipulater. I bet she could pull off zanatos gambits.

I'm not good at Star Wars history
dat old man river

Wouldn't the gist of them have been set down back then?
All we can really do is present possibilities, and argue their merits, but we're not gonna reach a solid conclusion one way or another, 'cause it's headcanon
Random, but I think the ponies would smell good.
13zzzzzz
he's not? aww
they actually smell like leek
you know

Dr. Doom has Doombots, not Doomettes -_-

IIRC that map came from the books
yeah
brb
i got washing to do fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
