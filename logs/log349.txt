they have awesome voices
or Equestria propaganda, whatever
and then everyone was just like
LLLLLLLLLAAAAAAALLLLLLA
WILD GUESSING ENSUES
I guess they found the old flag offenssive?
*wears the hat off*
Yes, and most world war II movies have too many stars on old glory.
IT BURNS
LAUGHTER AND SINGINING
And that's how Equestria was made!
this predates luna/celestia/discord
sure
strange luna/celestia flag
this show has continuity probs
lol
X3
maybe they all individually worshipped them
freude schöner götterfunken
and thats how equestria was made
eeeeeendd
i'd assume they're mythical beings used for heraldry
twilight and rarity stuck together...theyre such elitists
Hand to heart
Me too
the end
daww
i skipped this the last time i watched the episode
*rises*
Lol!! Nittany :D
y¿lazy layout artists
pffffrt
the end
seeing as they are deities
Equestria. Earth and all of the other names combined
how did alicorns come into equestria then?
i see like 20 colgates
because
I wish this how wars would truly end
Genetics

Winter Wrap up
cross-breeding?
Carol is the worst part
THE FUCKING
CLOSE THE WINDOW!!!!!
and now time for breakfast
50 cycles after that she sent her sister to the moon
Best, episode, ever
Too bad celestia didn't even attend the play
Humans?
Star Swirl's special talent is genetics
WINDOOOOOOW
window wrap up
scary sh*t
pinkie face
Roooooarrrroooarrroooarrrr!!!!!
Cold War 2!
it's canon
cross breeding
REWR
Then Celestia and Luna showed up to free them.

this episode is how equestria was founded
might be a while before we get more
And back to the theme quarrel
Carol is best song in series!
http://crimsonbugeye.deviantart.com/art/How-Pinkie-Pie-got-her-cutie-mark-281949232

applejack connection
I'm going to sleep for two hours
i'll see yyou all then

Same, first time!;)
For a while AFK
Sorry, still waking up here.
Well it it was free then heck yeah why not

/me is making muffins~
lol
Heh?
just remember to JB it though
whats the first thing everybody watching on here?
1st
why derpy?
watched i mean
Nah, I was just saying this is my first time on here as well :)
^
Damn, I wish I could draw.
ok

Jail Break it
11:22
11 22
Hey, me too!

You do the pony pokey and you give a little shout::[COME OUT
11:22 am

aww yeah guitar solo
I'm still learning how to draw, i've got some basic concepts down.
22:11
oooh, that's gotta be Celestia

lol
The image is bothering me now.
yeah
I just bought the best shirt ver!
haha same here

ikr?
05urk that angle
And we know of four long-legged ponies: Celestia, Luna, and.. Flim and Flam.
:)
awwww
:)
LOL
But I always stay up til 2-3 am
It has Rd and it says "This shirt just got 20 percent cooler"
Hard for me to wake up at 10:00 after that
http://www.mackinacponyco.com/
Watchin' them sleeps!
I be an Arizona bronette.
Wish I could draw like that... best I can do is a stickfigure
thats a llama in the pic
But srsly guise, it just might be Flim/Flam.
Garrett you win an internets
same :D
-.-
hello
same here
up late*
And then where would we be?
>.>
Oh I wanted to work on my drawings. I want to get done atleast 2 pics and digitalize them
I'm sticking with that theory until it's indisputably a llama.
Flim&flam.... thats creepy
supposedly "Fluttershy"'s on here
I guess I should've said nightpony. Crap.
can any one hear me????
Jordie La Forge + Rainbow Dash Fanfic
yep
you mean read you?
lolwat
I think i could draw something decent, but the problem is digitalizing it...
yep, and technically ...damn somone made the joke

you should read progress
My mind isn't as pure as it should be. When my brain first registered 'pony rides' it made me think of it in a different context than that website intends.
if i get a shirt (and i probably will) thats the one i would get
Oh ok....oh...OH! O.O
Hey guys, COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE TOPIC HERE.
I bought a RD shirt that says "This shirt just got 20 percent cooler"
Good, and yourself? :)

"RUN"
http://i.imgur.com/l0YBp.jpg
omg
But, for those with older (10+ year old Pods now or getting slowly on there now), have lost nothing
yes, give me a second.

One of the most inappropriately hilarious things to me is Celestia traumatizing her guards.
Sorry >.<

When there are two ruling sisters they cannot be queens.
Two are princesses.

this season has been full of little things like that
If one of them leaves or expires, then one is a Queen.
One would ascend.
and then Derpy
omg
lolololol
But i'm not mortal, so...something that eyes were never meant to see.
Wait wut
tham
05,15I think this season has been full of things people WANT to be references, but really aren't
Celestia was not Queen Celestia because her sister was still alive.
.....ohh comfusing

I watch this livestream for the plot!

That's some cool tricks with that program.
it would probably be more devious
05,15I've already read up to chapter 20...but 20.5 turned me off of it
I think most drawing programs can do this
05,15and now I need motivation to finish
where are 4th wall portals are...the tv or comp monitor
That's where it is :)
Do we even know that it's because of Derpy?

:'( thats sad
"ill stop the robber later.....ponies on atm"
considering derpy isnt even autisitc or mentally disabled at all but is instead just extremely clumsy
And I don't feel Derpy is at All unkind toward Autistics
Don't think stream's live
yeah
i doubt a sensible person would be offended
Derpy looks a little bit Dispraxic... yeah... but...
derp
damn....
Clips from SB's stream probably
I choose derpy
:P:| derpy trixie!
@Doomedmeter

shes just a goofy cartoon character to me, that would mean those "offended" would also be hating on other cartoon characters, like scooby or goofy
RainbowDashLover, it's another Autistic Condition

she doesnt seem unintelligent necessarily, just very goofy and clumsy

i know
Is it an alien?
I think she might be busy with comissions
the force is stronge with this one
That was predictable.
Oh well
It was fun.Dont Come Back!
YES!
yes she's an alien I believe.
GOON IS AWESOME!
"well guys, been fun" best.line.ever
"GOONE"
HE'S ALIVE IMPOSSIBLE!
I can't shake them

Todd
GOOOOOON
and she's vacationing
Let's blow this thing and go home
lol
Dont get cocky kid
E.T'S ALIVE?!:D
any way i doubt she would just disappear without saying anything
I've just completely Ponified my TF2.
the movie that had the most plot twists iv ever seen
about 10 minutes left... give or take
ok did anyone actually die
He's alive too?! How did?!
Korso shot first
I think that would work
idk
lol
Wrong
1,3the movie is pretty formulaic actually
frenship comes with ammo
I shot first
You never know with that kind of thing.
Domination!
/me hugs Roxsnow~
05,15YEAOOO That shot was one in a million!
Why do I think "Protoss Archon" when I see that... thing?
this movies physics are fucked up
you shure about that
No, it would be weird it that happende thought.
If you want to disappear, not saying anything is pretty much part of the deal.
ET Phone home with ET&T more bars on more planets
nvm diff character
Oh okay then.
I thought energy couldn't be destroyed.
jewish alien is having too much fun
hes neck was snapped
come on come on come on

When the bad guys leave its a bad idea
energy can be converted into matter
crack

Saying' bye then not leaving any contact is the same thing
I WANT
if Mr.T and ET had a child it would be Mr.ETT
MY
PONIES
That's leaving.

If you doN't even say anything, people are more likely to look for you
Not disappearing.

Abando Thread!
i owuldnt have done it and let him do it but never mind
lol
You've achieved movie cliche #11!
This heroic sacrifice nets a 6/10. Too overdramatic and slightly too overacted.
This is some really sappy writing
she went on vacation or something
But nice of him all the same.
oh snap
Use the force!
That journal entry is from November
Okay, he would not have surrvive that expolsion.
I know
Damn long vacation.
