You mean she's not? Next you're going to say Trixie isn't part of the Mane 7, Barry
/me groans at the bad pun
they're still rioting?
only appearing in one episode is not enough to be a "mane" character
4Guys
i am everywhere
Lyra and Bonbon have more luck becoming part of the "mane" 8 than Trixie does

Val,you die now.
Woah ther ValtheJean

btw, what made you decide to sit like a human, anyway?
the command is quite obvious
Did't you see the comic?
Mmmm, ponies
because why is there a back rest if we arent supposed to use it?
So
Is that just the posture you find most comfortable?
Gilda is the ONLY character WORTHY of being deemed the Griffon Francis.
Those backrest are there for a reason so she's gonna use em.

All your base are belong to CTR, for great justice!

all I can think of is friendship is magnets in that first scene
exactly sumica
/me 7likes her luna background more :P
The small and cheery MirthTinker does not approve of stream derp?
*Noms on the waffles midair*
luna is awesome.
Wow

12that's not chocolate...
moustaches make everything better
12it's coffee
...
And-a-me, Luigi
>_>
lol Dermathil
Technically Dari, even though you're serious you're still a troll :P
You would think he would want to use the growing magic in a diffrent way.
*snicker*
7she does
manstache
lol
oh dear Sumica
because all one needs to do to be a troll is goad people for negative responses :P
He would have a better chance if it were a moooooostaaaaache
waluigi has best mustache
No, it can't be
7found mojito does that count?
MANSTACHE
what you would think he would want to be taller.
I mostache you a question.
it's coffee laced with floof
I love when Twi laughs
Nah, Wario has best mustache
I'll get something to drink then.
12it's not true
where is your mind at?
Waluigi DOES have the best mustache.
It must be hot chocolate
12it's impossible!
that's what happens in friendship is magnets sumica
So we're drinking?
I NEED NO MOUSTACHE TO BE AWESOME.
Sathi, it counts more than coke which is all I have.
It's perfect for twirling.
Are WE DRINKING?
And Evil makes it all compleeeete
Freddie Mercury has the greatest moustache
No, The Sea Serpent has the best mustache
Spike in owls well ends well has best moustache
indeed
Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeensssssssss
call a drink
suddenly, Sumica gave someone an idea for a fanfiction somewhere. Something we shouldn't talk about.
Coffee and chocolate's moderate hybrid is hot chocolate
Gilda has best moustache

Not you Sathi.
If she gets drunk by drinking every time she sees herself, she's either a lightweight, or the cloning machine went haywire again
Aww
i can do anything better than you
Sumica intentional, she actually does have ability. The moral is about natural skill vs actual skill
I can't keep up with the drinks
Can't they find a better word to describe it?
Huh? Oh sorry Tinkerbelle. Bless you... I was, err, a bit distracted.
Next: YOU!
I hate her so much

Dashie ftw indeed.
Trixie is brilliantly written, she actually does try to fight off the ursa where any other character like her would turn coward and run
10/10 for dashie
And this is where Trixie just gets mean-spirited.

Bears like in caves.And bears are crazy.
In Zero Mission? yeah, there are.

Rezo nope they are just stupid
THE GRRRRRRRRREAT AND POWERRRRFULL TRRRRRRRRRRIXIE!!
I hate all the major 'puns'
There's none in the original game or Metroid II, though.
russians can fight of bears!
I never said they're smart. Just that they've balls
>Monster Hunter music
communist trixie to the rescue!
>dat trixie face
... okay.
These puns are a major source of frustration for you, InsertCupcake?
man, Trixie looks naked without her cloak and wizard hat.
You can only have balls, if you know how dangerous something is.
Huh? You did? Oh, sorry, was distracted. *shit shit shit, need to play it cool, stupid sexy trixie* Yeah, it took itself too seriously for it's script.
Should have seen that coming really
Major - joke #2
THE GRRRRRRRRREAT AND POWERRRRFULL TRRRRRRRRRRIXIE!!
Come at me, trixie
In Equestria Bear scares off Trixie. In Soviet Russia, Trixie scares off bear

Getting the power suit back is the best moment in the game though.
So MirthTink, what say we roll on out after this ends? I'll even give you a lift *gesturing towards his wings* back.
Oh now it's the dark blue text again.
It works because Ursa Minor's have low will saves, but high fort/reflex saves.

Ms. Pie is more powerful than Trixie.
Wait, wait wait wait. I had the scouter on upside down. It's. Over nine thousand. *calmly destroys scouter.*
Gentlecolts, you all will remember the day you allmost caught THE GRRRRRRRRREAT AND POWERRRRFULL TRRRRRRRRRRIXIE!!

Eh, pinkie pie isn't as important. But no fluttershy is unacceptable.
Fluttershy that is.
dashite stop trolling me
*pursing lips, embarrassed* Oh come on MirthTinker, you know I'm only interested in you. Trixie may be attractive, but she's no Tinkerbelle

Well, maybe you'd appreciate Trixie a little more if you were more similar to here *evilgrin*

I wish the other Hero PMV wasn't utter crap
I prefer the 80's version.
(OMFG I LVOE THIS SONG! Feeds my Hero Complex so well)
I request this:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtIx0dRoM9g
13Not now :P
where does that song come from?
ewww it's this version of the song
and wut? Soarin' sname explained?
@FreezeFrame phfff, everything is crap without ponies :P That's why ponies make everything better
13Doing !pillow will make you feel better though
3.14
No, it's a horrible PMV
06!pillow

Soarin = Soren = Son of Writer.

/me throws an explosive pillow at Ray
13:D
/me uses AE as pillow instead
OH for CELESTIA's SAKE! TINK!
LINK, Y U NO HYPER
And I wish people would put the full title of the song in their video titles.
Why would anyone need to explain Soarin's name?
/me ninja dodges
Ponies inject love and tolerance into the target.
^not a request
06espeon floof
06awesome pillow
This is not "Hero", it's "Holding out for a Hero"
dawwww...Soarin's name is now that much sweeter
Just like the other one is "I Need a Hero"
oh, and sorry bout that SilverMare...I'd say this'd be blue balling you but...
but seriously, here's my request http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMrQcn-LiO0&feature=channel_video_title
agreed, this has nothing on the Bonnie Tyler version
Know what MirthTInker? I think you did this to me on purpose
6>implying I'm doing requests
In fact, I'm SURE you did
6I'm not taking requests right now.
if you were
but you're not
so yeah
/me burns it
6And if I was, I wouldn't take them posted in this channel.

02Onions make me cry
But the cat forced the spell I was already thinking in my mind! When I was surprised it fired automatically!
>imposing you are doing requests
(oops wrong name)
/me gives Ray a 10 foot peeled onion
MirthTinker... somehow i get the feeling that's a common problemfor you
yo dawg I heard you liked soarin, so I gave your son soren a soarin t-shirt so you can love soarin' whilst you love soren.
there are other channles?
Suddenly, 63Silvermane (Silvermare) appeared.
/me trows it at Alaska
/me eats the onion o-o

YEAH

nvm
You know that dance is't as safe as you would think.
Lol!

*starts dancing uncontrollably*
It's the club mix, Bjornfot, not the original.
/me dances.

7indeed it is
6Because I picked whatever video.
This version sucks
6I don't really care if it's the music video or not.
6>>;
6You suck.
It's not the real thing, though.
It's a cover
Ohai Bjornfot,looks like you're in the main chat aswell.
We can dance if we want to
How far is Bjornfot in his coding?
Pegacorn wait their are other chats?
Yeah SilverMare, I can fix it...IF you promise you're sorry for crushing on Trixie and lying about it. I'm okay with you looking at other mares, its natural, but please don't lie to me.
FORGET WHAT I SAID
you don't want to know Spazturtle.
what did Alaska ever do to you? :(
What, Dermathil?
02Having snow :U
How far are you in coding your program, Bjornfot?%
the drama oh the drama.
How would you confirm such a thing, MIrth?
What program?
so? D:
oh, flip it.
>only 60GBs
we don't get snow enough and I don't want revenge on alaska :(
*either

13Oh LOL
02not it isn't that
What are you transfering?
13Never heard of people shampooing their car before though
Oh, the sim? Why didn't you say so!
02It's because Alaska has snow
02I have never seen snow :<
A few years' worth of company data to a new storage unit
what would a safety dance cutie mark look like?
I was forgetting what the word was, Bjorn
A traffic cone?
the men without hats logo
no
Well, I haven't got a single byte down. I have to wait for the other clowns do deliver the materials first.
how far are you in the coding of the sim, Bjornfot?
that would be vlc cutier mark
aaaah, makes sense Bjornfot.
Good night everypony! Also happy Luna is the best Luna.
I can't really do anything without graphics or a script, you know?
Good night mazoot
bye mazoot
night mazoot
unless you want me to make the game all by myself
Can somepony play my request?
I liked Luna's Chill Day fic.
True, script is necessary, but can't you use placeholders?
AAWWWW YEAH
>mfw Dinosaur dance
Yeah

13Erm, no pun intended LOL

MLP Dating sim?
Well
EEYUP Bjornfot
thats unfortunate
Idontknowhowifeelaboutthis.jpg
that's the sad irony of life sometimes
You are making a .... Pony ... Hentai game?
Pinkie isn't scared. She's confused.
6I'm tired of people complaining that their request didn't get played when it's against the rules.
I'm going to get pizza. BRB.
where you want something really bad but when you get it you get sick of looking at it XD
6So I'm not playing requests this week.
I doubt it, Brony1
Brony1,umad?
Oh I read about that game a bit ago.....I think.
Not all dating sims are Hentai
6I'll pick up requests probably after LotR.
>yfw there's going to be an humanized version of the dating sim
I don't know, i am gusta or not
I'm ok with that
Yes, it's gonna have porn.
LOTR already?
/me wonders if reverse psychology would work on SirSprinkles
Ah, never mind.
/me is getting into this song
If you get people to translate the character's personalities accurately
6Because it's been a while.
SirSprinkles, you should not play a video wherein Rainbow Dash is awesome, set to the song "Don't Stop Me Now".
It'll be great success
yay
AVAST!!!!
Dermathil: ಠ_ಠ

I played this out loud at work yesterday. Fun times.
Only in the movie 'Hackers'
it's fun to be a brony huh allis :P
Brony1: It's been done in real life
Cool story bro.
Indeed. It's even more fun when you're in a position of power of sorts and people aren't allowed to give a shit what you like or not in their respect for you
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_broadcast_signal_intrusion is the coolest example
....Imagine if you broke into the principal's office of a large school and played this on the intercom.
For the /entire school/
And that is why we need a brony president/prime minister
*shaking her head* Tinkerbelle... can we get out of here? Not that i don't love this song, but i don't feel right after... you hit me again.
How many lurking bronies would it lure out?
I did somthing small scale like that at work using the bluetooth enabled projectors in the conference rooms.
Awesome.
YOU ARE TEARING TINKERBELLE APART SILVERMARE!
On April Fool's, I'm changing the DNS entry on my servers from Google.com to this song...
Or something equally awesome.
i could just kick something
I would make this face espylacopa /)^u^(\

Fishes and worms: No rights in Equistria
Yeah, I told you I'd turn you back to normal if you'd promise to be open about looking at other mares. I know its only natural for a colt like you SilverMare, just don't lie about.
I'm in the middle of some PnP RPGing on another IRC server.
>mfw FreezeFrame is Rping
>colt like you, silverMARE :D
Got a halfling paladin without stick up backide
>mfw my friend drew his pony oc and its a fucking alicorn
*sigh, grumble grumble* Fine Tink. I promise to not hide looking at other mares. But I don't like doing it around you anyways, you know? it's just...
<mi cara cuando once I realized that all this mfwing doesn't work without images
There are only three alicorn.

Just what? *totally innocent smile*
LEFT CARAT IS NOT RIGHT CARAT, DRAGONRAGE!

(he prolly does)
Celestia, Luna, Nyx
Nyx? GTFO
I love this song.
Errrmmm, Mirthtinker, I'd rather not say. Nothing worth worrying about.
Ignaesia yfw the mlp crew makes Nyx canon
My S2 prediction: Twilight adopts Scoots

4But, it wasn't a Pinkie song
and come september the games are gonna start coming in droves
I don't like Katy Perry either, that's not the point.
4It was Katy Perry
Huh. Dragonpony pic.
Don't have to be a fan of Katy Perry to like the song.
TUMMY TUMMY TUMMY
Fat ugly troll is fat
02It has games yeah
Dat pose.
02But does it haves GOOD games?
7dat rant

My LIttle Pony: Making Katy Perry bearable
02OoT is a remake, doesn't count\
10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT7UWCJo6GE
4It's all personal preference, mind you
02remakes don't count for me :\
10Best song?
YOUR WHALE CUM
>implying anything can make Katy Perry bearable
The point is they acknowledged us, and dedicated something specifically to us. How many fandoms get that. :/
Not many.
10^
10BUT NIGEL MADE IT BETTER
^

...
ports don't count for me
remakes do :B

/me 10WINs
My Little Thornberries: Friendship is BLARGHARAGH?
You guys make me so sad. They gave us something that good, and you like the horrible defaced version better.
10^
10ff
10it's not horrible
10it's even better
10SilverMane go die
Don't worry dari I didn't like it either
Fluttershy is adorable even when she's evil
>implying we all like the "defaced" version better
Pinkie's epic laugh
Mai Waifu, WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?
I HAVE AWWIVED
10SilverMane I said go die <3 But I didn't mean it
10oh shit, interior_gummy time
Photo Finish is second-best pony after Trixie
DA MAJICKS
I have half a mind to take this belt off right now. to show you ALL of my <3
They did deface it.
>mar, disfigure
....Heh, Avatar: Friendship is Magic (Avatar the Airbender) pic.
They changed it beyond recognition
4Again, how can you deface something when it's already shit :/
Fluttershy giving the Facestealer Koh the Stare.
Dari, y'all being kinda melodramatic there.
10No. They made it what it deserved to be. A godly shimmering image of wonderment
um...technically Ghosties that means Equestria Girls was shit
Ghosties, you're missing the meaning of the word if you ask that question. :P
THE MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE APPROVES OF THIS VIDEO
They gave something to a fandom known for doing such things.
THE GRRRRRRRRREAT AND POWERRRRFULL TRRRRRRRRRRIXIE!!
They knew what they were doing.
also, MirthTinker, my little Minx, what say you?
Guys, guys, guys. The Great and Powerful Trixie.
The Great And Powerful Trixie, Eh?
so is this boast busters in a nutshell?
Valthejean: that's what he means
7heh
7yes
Pretty much, Sumica.
yep
naked trixie
4What I'm implying is that Equestria Girls, to me, is shit. Defacing is implying that you made it bad, and I'm saying how can you make it bad when it's already bad
So what are we doing right now?
watching random stuff
post-show
and bitching
/me grabs pitchfork
Ghosties by adding Matt Smith to it
dari is doing random vids.
hounds unleash hounds
a brony that doesn't like Equestria Girls? Now I've seen everything
4Who the fuck is Matt Smith o.o
HOUNDCEPTION
FreezeFrame: It's not me
10EdwardNewgate I LOVE YOU
10SO MUCH
It's Sprinkles.
@Ghosties: 11th Doctor
Smithers, release the hounds
Ah, right
4>yfw I have no clue who Matt Smith is
Ask Dari
Oh God.
Not Matt Smith.
Don't ask me.
Ghosties: He's the newest Doctor Who actor
10Dari.
Fuck Matt Smith.
who Dari hates with every bone in his body
ILU Rainbro
10U mad cause Matt Smith is best doctor?
AND THEN THEY FUCKED
>yfw i've never watched Dr Who
Nope
10ILU2 EDWARDNEWGATE
I mad, not for that reason though
Rainbro be trollin hard

10dari, y u no mad

I'm not the biggest fan of Dashie but
OMIGOSH

10[ger]Brony1 I'm not trying to talk about the worst doctor here.
10jeez
I liked the R lee vesion of that video.
I don't know where to start with that series
No? But why did you mention Matt Smith then?
MFW I'm about to smash this bottle on something because of RainBro.
Wooo
10also: Why so much hype about David Tennant? He cries sometimes, omghessuchagoodDoctor D: D: D:
Yaaaay

Rainbrodash I like him a lot, but 5th doctor is my fav
wohoo
Way to gooo~

MLP crossed with How to Train your Dragon
HIYA
A MULE
EspyLacopa: FUND IT
Like the First Doctor said in 'Three Doctors': "This is my replacement? A dandy and a clown?" And MS is both in one person.
10EdwardNewgate, I think Matt Smith has brought a great new dynamic to the show, and has made the show accessible to a wider audience
7eeeeh
Wohoo~
Oh God.
Seriously?
How fucking...
God.
What the fuck.
How can you say that?
If you really want to mess with Who fans, mention that Eighth Doctor is Best Doctor. :P
4*claps for RainBroDash*
umad prince0dari?
/me considers linking the Yahtzee insult towards the newest doctor :P
I can't help it.
mfw RainbroDash finally trolled Dari
Matt Smith is easily the worst Doctor.
/me slow claps
Prepare to face the business ends of torches and pittforks, FreezeFrame
trololololol
hey Dari

10Dari, it's true. Ratings can't lie, and it's being watched by the old and the young now, not just the archetypal fanbase
10ergo best doctor
Lawl.
Brony1: I don't believe it personally.
Can't argue with facts
Tennant's been voted as the best.
SO many times.
*who
I agree RainBroDash, I use the same argument as to why the Wii is the best console ever made
RainBroDash: eh...I would argue against that. Considering a majority of the world is filled with incestuous idiots
dat typo
LOL Ignaesia.
XD
;D
also, SNES is best console
Nice one.
:)
mfw Wii IS best console ever made
Amiga is best console

Trolling you said? .... Hmmm ... Sega Mega Drive is best console!
Valthejean what did Rainbrodash say yesterday?
Ah, Cutie Mark Failure Insanity Syndrome
snes brought us yoshi, instant best console
EdwardNewgate oh nothing, just a little thing between us ;)
"some Soi on RBD action" Do it faggot!
Nah, I think the general consensus is no, tbh, amirite other viewers?

what are we watching?
That video is lovely
I hate that song
But with ponies everything sounds better
How long till robot time?
7have not seen any sign of dcd yet
FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU
testing
7oh no
... best Rick Roll ever.
It's not a rickroll
Leet Street boys version is better
We weren't told that it was something else
6Leet Street Boys are pretty awesome.
13o-o
I actually saw this come up in a topic on ponychan.
/me watches as Nick gets pelted with bricks
suddenly, sprinkles
Pony roll then
:O
And yeah, it was a rick roll there.
My point is
6But I'm playing this one, so, since it's related to me, it's 20% cooler.
/me is okay with this.
why are the ads on here considered "malicious" by my AV?
Misleading the viewer is what makes a "roll"
/me 7has adblock
6...that's wrong.
6So, so very wrong.
/me points to his previous comments.
7oh well..it included ponies
7all good
Yeah, I'm okay with this as well
who else can hear the singing?
7I cant
Very faint
I can hear it a little.
i knew these expensive headphones would eventually come in use
lawl
I can, barely
Oh hai, Bronies. How's your sex lives
The video says instrumental probably
7I like the music
7:)
sex life?
7instrumental or not
Is that the name of a new rock band?
>Awesome Dash instrumental
It's a reference to The Room
Trixie is my waifu, i have to be faithfull to her.
Not quite as awesome without the singing, though.
I have a waifu too, but she's not from FiM :(
Luna is my waifu
She was 7 years earlier.
I did not hit her it's not true it's horseapples i did not hit her. I did nawt. o hai, riders
whoever does twilight's singing voice is amazing
No wai! Luna is my mistress-waifu. lol

my waifu is the best waifu.
Yayayay
Theoboldi = Thanks for backing me up
/me 7is feeling all warm and fuzzy now
Hmmm .... Canterlot is a pretty ugly castle imo.
you're welcome
*brohoof*

And for everybody else, yes, the singing can be very faintly heard
OMG it's Reading Rainbow!

Thus is life
Wait, you're not a pony? :O

12ITS A LIE!
>mfw 22 minutes 'til Super Robot Saturday Show
huh? oh, yeah. That Trixie and show-girl Pinkie got me all.. WORKED up
Dermathil: >mfw i thought it was 52 minutes
I love it when one of the characters flips out.
isn't it at 9PM EST?
i thought 9:30 Eastern
>derp then
video has been removed by the user?!
i love it when one of the characters says "my little pony"
7WAT!
>by the user
>not Hasbro?
Better than removed by a dick corporation.
hasbro is a dick?
or by a troll
dat bass
Sry.
Most of the stuff I listen to is owned by dick corporations (like WMG, UMG, Sony, EMI, and the like).
so...i guess this is a song about how to get rid of trolls?
Hope it gets rid of copyright trolls.
I wonder how much copyright trolling I could get away with.
?
none?
No. YT bows down to copyright claims w/o question.
Due to fear of lawsuits.
In honor of tonights presentation: http://2ch.so/mlp/src/1313417880277.jpg
lol, seen that one before
What did I miss?????
season 2 sneak peek

thanks
6WHY must you ruin my fun?

Hallo again
OMG! HELLO BARRY!
Dashite speaking dat CW.
I'm speaking what now?
Continuous Wave.
12o.o
The amateur radio term for Morse.
Oh
SPEED DASHER
I actually don't know morse, but have an amateur radio license.
I don't know it either.
does anyone know morse?
nope
Some hams still use it.
morse is just an old wives tale
The extent of my morse code knowledge is ... --- ...
Last time I turned my ham radio on, I caught a broadcast in morse.
What YTP is this?
It wasn't on a frequency range parsed for morse, though.
What's this video called?
Has anyone else noticed that "the teddybears picnic" sounds eerily familliar to the witches castle theme from banjo kazooie?
If there are any ham bronies here, my callsign is K4NTT.
lol censored
Doug!!
those eyes
What is love
lol, clicking on random videos?
Love is like, you know, when you meat someone and you don't want to kill them.
Shadowbolts of the Damned
Also, Suda51 ponies!?
So I just got the BEST
Chinese fortune
EVER
Feh locked up on me.
what?
what was the fortune?
"For true love? Send real roses preserved in 24k gold!"
lol
BAHAHAH
I once got a fortune cookie that was empty
thats brilliant
Me too Shiggyz, it was during my bad-luck-week
this sounds familliar
What A CARTOON!!
THATS IT
happens every month during crescent moon
Hi Vaporeon
o3o
Ahh.
ohai removed video
That song.
removed by user
12o3o!
THIS SCENE
that song, where's it from!?!?!??
Man, I miss the days when most of what was on Cartoon Network was awesome.
Quan?
6Do you know how often Aero D. comes on IRC?
cant remember
I miss the 90's.
Oh god
Megas XLR
Almost never LOL
2 stupid dogs...ah the memories
wait
She actually just left my house
dragonrage, when was that?
6Hmm.
Aren't many good shows on now.
I missed the beginning, but Megas XLR was awesome anyway
2 stupid dogs is back on CN
Spongebob is going to crap.
The 90s, pretty much.
7that's so cute... but its WROOOOOOOOOOOONG
There is some stuff on CN.
I know! its such a breath of fresh air, OH, and they have classic looney tunes on CN now too
The only way to contact her now is probably through me, Roara (thoguh she's busy atm), skype, or fb
idk
She barely comes on here now
2 names. Gendi Tartokofski and Craig McCracken
Nick is all about live-action teen shows with fake singers.
7we have boomerang here ;)
Pinkazoid?
7classic cartoons
the new looney tunes kind of sucks
Yeah.
but they are also showing classic looney tunes
thats cool and stuff
how is the new thundercats?
so its not completley bad, although I agree, the new looney tunes show sucks
I like the league of super evil for the short amount of time it was on CN
but idk that new show with bugs and daffy as roommates is really dumb
think about it this way, current cartoons are marketed to TODAY'S generation of kids, it makes sense that we wouldn't enjoy it as much as the ones that were made for /us/
I liked it too, shame it was canceled
The new Thunder Cats is good, but not as great as it could or should be
You know that Friendship is Magic appeals to the kids of the 90s when almost every crossover has a 90's theme to it
04Few people in the Cali group ever jump on IRC anymore
I may watch then Riders
The new Looney Toons Show is too grounded in reality.
Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers!!!!
league of super evil wasn't half bad
L.O.S.E was funny
... there you go, I just proved my point LOL
6Nyeh?
It's not just the cartoons that were aimed at us, even the older classics were amazing compared to most of today's cartoons.
6More than half do. ovo
Instead of all over the place and random like the old cartoons were.
04that's few to me
I like random comedy.
No, I don't disagree.
LOSE was good, but I still prefer Storm Hawks
It needs to relax its pacing a bit but it is fun. I personally thought Symbionic Titan was better though.
The new cartoons are just stupid funny, not witty funny
04And where's May
MAD on cartoon network isn't so bad
04She should be on
04And I need to talk to her
>Swat Kat
s
I wonder if MAD TV is still on.
storm hawks was intersting
/me is still angry about what happened to Swat Kats.
CN MAD is hit or miss, but its entertaining.
It's about DAMN time!
/me now has an urge to play Duke Nukem.
Sad how DNF met a bad end.
AHJAHHAA
/me says Swat Kats was great
FUCKING PERFECT
/me agrees
I keep hearing that DNF was painfully disappointing. =/
Don't get near it Dashite, it is a trainwreck of doom
yup
Yes, DNF sucked.
It was
I never played the full game, but I did play the demo.
Dermathil, I own the Balls of Steel edition
a painful, trainwreck of doom.
I couldn't stand the first level.
The demo was nice.
It would have rocked like TEN YEARS ago.
I like how ZP covered DNF
I feel your pain then Dashite.
12derp
It's not just because of the insanly long wait?
its no surprise DNF did poorly considering it hit so many development stumbles. It was outdated at its conception and struggled to keep up
I feel no pain. :p
gearbox wasted their time on that game
But the full game looks like soft-core porn, and I'm not a fan of porn.
DNF made money
LOLOLOLOL
^
Just because it's a DN game
Yay!
this again
Pinkie and the Brain!
robots yet?
Trashware makes more money than Vaporware.
9LET'S GO MIGHT GAINE LET'S MIGHT GANE
Hi DCD!

9yeah
9It switches to me later
4Ah, cool
The Doctor has arrived
9hello
9I'm David Tennant
TENNANT!!!
OMIGOSH
/me squeals
4Hey, DCD, check the announcement for the Giant Robot Saturday Night and tell me if it looks good
OHAI best doctor!
**** I should have chose that name NewDCD
HARRY TROTTER
Harry Plopper
A hairy potter? What?
is there any thing not poniefied yet?
No
The Simpsons?
9Ghosties: I'm not streaming just animu though. We also stream Megas. There's also the fact that we don't go Kawaii Desu, and if I will stream anything outside Robots it will be Hokuto No Ken
^^
Yer a wizzard, Twilight.
9then again Kenshiro is as awesome as a Mech
4Well
4Too bad, it's staying
4<3
will we be showing The giant robot series from last night?
9DAT GHOSTIES
9everfreenights: this is the order
9Gundam X 02-04
9Eureka 7 02-04
4And hey, I put mecha in there
9Big O 02-04
i havent seen a ponified Obama
9DERP I mean
9Gravion 02-04 is before Big O
got it.
9and after Big O, Megas XLR 02-04
perhaps my next project...
Nighty night all
Someone say Pony Obama? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7rf1hJEy91qcqvepo1_500.jpg
and lord of the rings is next week?
4@TenthDoctor: DAT OTAKU RANT
I can't remember how long ago this movie was released.
7yes
woo!
9NO GHOSTIES NO
Wasn't it back during the turn of the century?
9I hate that word
oh bunbaskets... then ill just go wit ha ponified bill engwall
Didn't we watch episode 2 of all those series except Megas last week?
9can't they say Anime Fan or something?
9Otaku sounds so retarded
4u mad bro?
lawl
Dashite = Surprisingly more tastefull than I would have thought
9as in, not "has a medical condition retarded"
OH HI
DCD: Will there be robots next week?
9but "it's idiotic" retarded
9yes
Wrek, I think you've got me on that one.
9there will be robots
9every week
Whenever I see the word "Otaku" I think "oh taco".
Nobody told me we were streaming today.
4Every Saturday
If I weren't having pizza tonight...
9Otaku pretty means: "lifeless geek" in Japanese and tends to have very negative connotations
4Um
Robots all the time
I guess next week I will have to stay up all night
Ghosties WHEN DID YOU CHANGE DAYS!?
4We have euro streams every Saturday...?
OH DUH
woah, still here?
DAT AD!
9so it's kind of stupid for people who like Japanese stuff taking a Japanese word which pretty means "psycopathic manchildren" and label themselves as such
dem horses
... so basically otaku is to japanese what the word "trekkie" means to anyone who isn't a trekkie?
Wow, I am stuuuuuppiddd
so, NOW can we do requests? ;D
4Yeah, DCD's about to switch over to his stuff
meh, i'll play some minecraft till things start up
What we watching?
9DragonRage: only WORSE

GOD DAMN
that I can agree with
I see the auto-kick script is still active
So question: Can we change our names again, or is it just a mod thing?
No name changes.
Just logout
Will SOMEPONY tell me if my email is even still there!?
9you can't unless I set mode to +N
+N is still on.
9so it's better if you just type /quit
Ah.
9change it
9and get back in
Not mad, just curious.
Quick Internet. Give me Village People ponies
9allow me to explain why
9you see
AHHHH
I love this song :D
You can't because of this:
9if people could change their names here freely
9we'd be getting
sdfg
... ah.
.....
Riders, will this do? http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4616858391_ff2d6a1078.jpg
Basically, retarded spammers ruin everything.
9so yeah, basically it forces that for changing their name
OH GOD
OK WE GET IT XD
9the viewer will have to type /quit
Ok.
You get it.
:P
9change their name and then reenter the channel
FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

GRAAAAAHHHHHhh
and yet you listen to rap
10I'm a creeper. :D
03I listen to the RADIO
/me sighs.
/me 9's Random Trivia: this is the most underrated Gundam series ever. EVER. It came right after Gundam Wing, which, being the (overrated) success it was, made Japan be "over-Gundam'd" and they ignored this show. And yet, it's probably the best Traditional Gundam show
03where they don't swear :P
13that you are
4D_E, I believe you were sent an email with an interview time. Plox check it
4if not, we'll reschedule
4it's cool brony
13exactly
4we don't hate you
oh right she was yelling
4we wub woo
/me 9BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY GUNDAM SERIES WHICH COMPLETELY LACKS EMO. And the only series in which Emo COULD have been more than justified
4Denied_Existence, PM
TEN HUT!
still
its crap er rap
Oh hey, NewDCD I tracked down a working Hero Legend torrent if you want it
Press R to reload
03I like it
13suddenly lag
03which is why I have a huge collection of instrumentals
13:(

9Jamil Neate: What happens when you fuse Amuro Ray, Bright Noa, and Quattro Bajeena into one character. EPIC AWESOME
He just realized the downside to using the new Soldier weapon.
10Welp, I've run out of money to fund my large porn obsession
4HAHAHA
Do Space colonies still exist in this continuity?
10Time to drink my own piss.
no
13ahahaha
4brilliant
9Riders: they do exist
sense, nothign else makes it!
well thats a bit unfair. problems should be solved with robots. not guns
9Riders: this is actually pretty much: "What would have happened if a Zeon Expy actually managed to do MULTIPLE Colony Drops in a single swoop"
Ohai waifu. <3
/me 10is now in teal
You are tearing me apart duudes
Oh, welp...shit

4missed the email?
EWW RAP!
4tis cool brothaa. I guess you want a new interview time?
9JAMIL PUNCH
wow my japanise is getting better I can almost keep up with the story with out reading it now.
then why the hell was she reading their minds?
I guess you DID send me an interview date...I SHALL PROCEED TO SLAP MYSELF REPEATEDLY

/me bashes his head against the keyboard...
its just the mainstream stuff
03see
03I don't like ALL rap
9we're live again
9that should solve it
03but there's some I do like
4hey D_E bro
4D_E, we'll put you down for another time then
03Eminem is one of few rap artists I like, really
Oh dammit, now i have qwertyuiop on my face...
4imma pm you 1 sec
03and that's for a couple reasons
031. He's from Detroit which is local to me
9pressing play
032. He actually talks about real stuff, not how high he gets and how many girls he sleeps with
and he curses like a sailor
03not in the ones I listen to LOL
03I like songs like Mockingbird and When I'm Gone
so much lag
NOPE
9everyone else can see it okay?
yes
yeah
everything is fine
I'm getting lag but I can see it
Kill guards to get hired - makes sense
man, must be tough economic times if you have to go through THIS to get a job
derp
9it's basically Fallout Meets Gundam Minus the Emo
10Is you're with your waifu, then the stream starts up, and King-Dari is streaming, and someone says "Hey get away from mai waifu", then you ask RainBroDash who it was, and they say it was Ghosties, but Shosties ate Ghosties, THEN WHO WAS STREAM?!
Clearly it must have been SirSprinkles.
oooh, gundams in fallout would be awesome!

Why is NewDCD always suffering from Identity crisis?
i passed lyra at the movies
"Also, we’ll be using your home as the location for the event. I was going to ask your permission, but then I remembered that the library is public property--so technically, it’s my library!" Ah, the fine art of trollestia
It was pretty good, though the ending was... weird.
You have manga in your library? My school is so bland -.-
she was in the fright night showing
12now a Heart Piece, a bottle, and 10 Skulltula Tokens
Why is Twi always translated as brown girl
SUN GLASSESSS
9KNIGHT FORK
Snaaaake!
9MY BROTHER IS CUTE
/me sighs
so i saw Lyra at the movie theatre
You don't announce when you have traps in chess
12I'll try for the Heart Piece again x.x
Implied incest
They're brothers?
I can't believe my little brother could be so cute.
KAWAII
/me slaps the fish
herospirit: the Manga is good, but I think it tries too hard to be TOO dark
/me slaps the fishing pond >:|
I've caught out an unsafe knight-fork because I didn't announce it was one.
Dat instant KO powder.

It is a different story than the Anime but I think the animu made me happier
ITS A TRAP
(Queen and King two spaces apart, I caught the queen because he moved the king wrong)

indeed
4rainbrodash, don't shit yourself
4but epic pic
Princess-Dari, ok figured out the times.
Tropers? Us? Don't be silly.
AllisZero : so the anime and manga are pretty much separate stories?
Er...Princess-Daria
/me laughs awkwardly because yes, he's a troper.
EVIL SCIENTIST
12get golden scale yet?
>mfw TvTroper
9I like reading TVTropes when there's nothing to do in my Cell Phone
About halfway through in the Manga they go different directions, yeah
/me nods
with a squirt gun?
12that thing is almost impossible to get
^lol
12obviously if I only need the 1 heart piece
oh, it's a syringe
EEVILLL
12as the Golden Scale gives you 2
Creeeeeeeeeeepy...

OH GOD NOT THIS TOO
12i thought the golden scale only gave you 1
9Tifa is Twilight Sparkle
/me 13is back
I thought Gundam episodes were obligated to end with a climactic battle between one or more giant robots.
Or is that just G Gundam?
Or we could see who kicks when someone uses colors
9you can't unsee
tiffa is dead
12it "technically" gives you 2
12unless you beat the WEater Temple
12-e

But yeah
ITS A TRAP
10No :<
4tbf. that is one sexy Les Paul Custom
Why is Twi a brown girl in every human version of her I find, pretty much?
4^this
NewDCD = Did this really come out after Wing? I'm enjoying it, don't get me wrong but it looks a little bit less crisp than I remember Wing looking like.
4^^that
12hmm
No idea, AllisZero.

9Random Trivia
hopefully
/me destroys the game cartrige(spelling?)
10Matt Smith is best Doctor
10U mad Dari?
4Now, why would you think that?
*cartridge
9all episodes in this series are named after a line spoken by one of the characters during the episode
wasn't he hired to KIDNAP HER? NOT KILL HER
how do i command for name change?
12back
logout
4RainBro, not even mad
also how do i shot web
RainBroDash, Doctor Whooves is best Doctor
9except for one case, to great dramatic effect
13hunty you can't
4I'm not falling for that again, RainBroDash
HHNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG
Looks too much like Gundam W
meanwhile, in SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXW
9eeverfreenights: it will be explained later
RainBroDash is Lord English
space*
It's him
And I have no fucking clue who Scootaloosuna is....
MATT SMITH CANT ACT
9AllisZero: Same character designer. NONE OF THE EMO BULLSHIT.
/me makes Umbreon play all 52 games in Action 52
DEPMGWOJV)DIPG:OIS+G¨WONDGP^QEWTPHG!/N*(T^BOAIE
12lolz
/me dies
If you want to change your name, you need to type /quit and then log back in under a new name.
Full series? I'm okay with that
or just click on the x
Oh, well that was actually going to be my guess....
12don't make me get Jeckyl and Hyde out here >:|
/me flees
I'm ashamed to say I only watched from Wing on
Mods can change their name at will, but that's becasuse they're awesome and we sadly are not. =/
Or /part #bronystate then /nick NewNick then finally /join #bronystate
4That's right
Instead of having to reconnect to the server.
9it's more to avoid IS NOW KNOWN spam
4Meeeowth, that's right~
Ghosties, who are you...really?
if it's a matter of being awesome, then why can't I change my nick, butterscotch?
that's too complex FreezeFrame
hunty is now
Feh
4Who am I?
4Who am I?
I really like the original Gundam Movies
4*dramatic pause* I'm Batman
13I know who you are!
I remember when you had to type everything to do anything.
/me makes Kosoveon play every game Nintendo has ever made
OMG IM HUNTY
You are Shosties.
4*dramatic pause* I'm Batman
Get off my lawn!
You aren't quite awesome enough. <_< On a scale of one to ten, you're a seven when you need to be an eleven.

I'm Batman, bitch
yaaaaay Earthbound
12Non stop :)
9DAT TITLE DROP
Why y bad guys no use guns?
9well more like Episode Title Drop
10Ghosties is Shosties, and Shosties is Ghosties, but if Ghosties is Shosties, and Shosties is Ghosties, then Shosties is Shosties, and Ghosties is Ghosties, so therefore Shosties is both Ghosties and Shosties, and Ghosties is both Shosties and Ghosties.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO METROID OTHER M NOOOO

Why is that everytime Gundam tries something different it fails to see success with wide audiences? (Except for G-Gundam, that one was just kind of lame)
DO IT FILLY!
9G-Gundam was cool though
Riders: If by "lame" you mean AWESOME

must not be much gravity
Dat J-rock

POWERRANGERS ACTIVATE
Dat engrish.
Soldier of Soldier? What The FUCK does that even mean!!
Thhheeeey've got, a power and a forcc like you've never seen before
NewDCD, question: is Gravion a super or real robot show?
9probably something like
Soldier of S.O.L.D.I.E.R.
From FF7.
SHINRA
9Hero of Heroes
OMFG
they ARE evil!
9something like A Soldier that is in the service of other Soldiers
0it means that he is the soldier of all the soldiers
Thhheeeeey've got, the ability to morph and to even up the score
9also, Dermathil: OBVIOUSLY SUPER

9use /quit
9input your new nick
9and then come back in
did it work?
no :/
NOPE
From TVTropes : If Evangellion is the deconstruction of the mecha genre, Megas XLR is the demolition of it.
12hmm
12aero meet aero
Sounds about right.
XD
yup XD
That's one of the reasons Megas rocks.
I remember when I first came on here
everyone thought I had taken AeroD's name
And that's why we love it
It turns everything mecha on its head and spins it like a top.
it took forever to prove it was a unique name I made up
MFW ENGLISH
why do you put it to japanise?
Megas is all about"LIL GIANT ROBOTS"
That was english
LOL
9and Gravion is the SHOWER SCENE of Mech animus
MFW LOLI NUDITY
@newDCD why did you put it to japanese?
I SURE HOPE MY MOTHER DOESN'T WALK IN
what is this

agreed, Megas is like a Moeblob of mechs...but awesome

Only a blind deaf man could find Matt Smith sexy.
This is why you build your giant gravity robot out of dark matter.
best robot is either giant robo or iron giant

They keep coming up with new weapons every episode

9I'm just like "I know God exists, but I think it's more of a 'humans should be independent and not rely on God' affair"

not as good as the samurai champloo ending. champloo ending is best pony
he doesn't fuck the robot, she's about the age of his daughter if he had one
9if ponies piloted mechs

9would "Mount Blades" be too cheesy a name for them?

Mount Frames = http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130897854407.jpg
would a pony mech us a giant toothbrush while wearing dark matter socks?
Yep, it's one of his episodes.
yes but only if they used the correct attack call
In fact, it's his first episode.
I wish I could spell his name.
in the name of god! brushy brushy!
9it's actually for a story I'm plotting which is one of those Massive Multiplayer Crossovers
Super Robot Wars: Equestria
why dose he have a city map printed on his head?
saddle mounts
04o-o
NOPE
9after a certain event in Equestria, a certain organization gives the Equestrian Government a bunch of design data on various mechs in other Worlds (like Arm Slaves, Mobile Suits, Variable Fighters, Armored Troopers, ect.)
Am I the only one that would want to see Major Dastun played by Sam Jackson in a live action movie
rainbow deuce
0who opens a door like that?
9cue Celestia commissioning their own line of Mechs with some human engineers working on them as well. So they're powered by both Technology and some Magic as well, and in mass production as well
Gas dosent work that way
o.o
lolwut
I want to touch the untouchable and break the unbreakable
HE IS BATMAN! OMFG
the rest of those papers were all 'all work and no play makes jack a dull boy' over and over
Took a moment to google it, now I can spell his name.
9oh it's that guy
This is a Schwarzwald episode.
9also he sounds like Bang Shishigami
0"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a brony"
he's part of big fire isn't he?
Shiggy = Are you implying that bronies are evil?
Shiggy... I shall live forever a hero, and I shall die a brony.
Hey newdcd you could try using other languages to come up with the name

Twilight Zone?

It is rather Twilight Zone-ish, yeah.
0i was about to type that, but i was positive everyone else made the connection
batman?
heya Drake
HHHNNNNGGGGGG
Giggle at the Ghosties, Roger!
9also three main lines of Mount Frames: Terra, Aileron, and Magia
ha ha ha
04ohai
... or break your legs, that works too.
/me hugs NS
I was just thinking that the piano piece that was playing earlier reminds me of the music from "Hotel Dusk"
CONFOUND THOSE PONIES THEY DRIVE ME TO EMOTION
Ohai ghosts
he keeps waking up in random places
9Terra: Ground-based Heavy Artillery Units, Aileron are swift flight types, and Magia pack beam weaponry up the ass
/me hugs Drake as well
:p
0this aint kansas...
Oh god, he's flashing back to his parents. He really is Batman
Oh she is so gonna extort you for that one roger
Riders, I know, right?
04Damnit
9so basically PONY TYPES: THE MASS PRODUCTION MECHS
WAYNE
BRUCE WAYNE
He's Batman in the city of Amnesia.
04when I'm thinking about my stories at night I can always think of the right words to say
Is Big O just a big Hodgepodge of homages?
Wayneright
He's Bruce Wayne with Amnesia
04But when I actually get to writing them they always slip away...
I like this plan
.
I NEVER PUT THAT TOGETHER!
I would swear that one of the ghosts that walked past him earlier was Harvy Bullock
BatmanxPhoenix Wright game. Do want!
0OH SHIT, i have a bag of milky ways!
He found a giant model city.
Harvey Dent: Ace Attorney! Spoiler Alert: it doesn't end well

inorite
Dat mellow showtime
I just realized.
This model city is inside the city.
04ADAMANT
04There
/me headslams
9DAT PUN
0shit, this sounds a lot like the Godzilla music
9CITYCEPTION
XD
her arms are flapping as she runs. weird
Dorothy is racist.
impossiboru
that like one of those you will not rape me mauntras?
9also I like the mech design of the enemy robot
Action!
04Also question: Would someone be able to walk on a fractured leg?
Lulz.
04ignoring pain and etc.
Dat Dynasty Warriors tailer
Sort of
it'd hurt like shit
It's like a zombie robot.
and would be very unstable and wobbly
04Perfect
04But I suppose a properly broken leg is out of the question?
YES
YES YES YES YES YES
man it's fast
popeye the mech
/me twi spams
Just in time for Big O
I think I found the perfect compliment to my design
oh NewDCD: Dragons can be Dracos, Diamond Dogs can be Crystal Dog-Fighters, Griffons can be Blade-Hawks
Hunter jump attack
Roger, you're destroying the city! Wait, it's just a model. Nevermind.
worst case with a broken leg would be a crutch
it wouldn't be possible for it to be broken AND walked on
FIRE ZE MISSILES
best case..
big bada boom
Giant Compression Blast Punches.
.:00:53:52:. <Drake> Also question: Would someone be able to walk on a fractured leg?
Head Lasers.
Barrages of Missiles.
lol Sumica, dat 5th Element reference
i think
is there anything Big O can't do?
correct
Bandaging the bone tightly would help a lot
9you're missing the Inside-Arms gatlings
Those too.
9and the hook/anchor chain thing
0its needs to be about 20% cooler...
04hmm
Even so, even hairline fractures can render to limb useless sometimes
And hundreds of innocent people are dead or homeless. Nice work Phoenix
the war of the worlds brand lasors too
No side
But a properly broken leg would be unable to stand on, because it's just that, broken.
04In this case the character is trying to carry an unconscious person home on his back
/me changes it to a large gash on his leg
Just have him drag his leg.
04Keep in mind it's a four-legged character so...
1 leg out of 4 = no problem
Man, I could watch this show forever.
tbh
Indeed, and a large gash would be more dangerous
if it was a front leg then yes
but.
Enough Mecha worship. Now for the DEMOLITION!!!
A large gash on the back to side of the leg actually, femoral artery.
9also what does Du Vont mean, anyways?
k?
9also before Megas I got to shut off the stream for a second
9gotta adjust quality
Do want
Do want in a german accent
Bring...back...my...ghost...
my god, those titles are delivered perfectly
there is somthing you want to not hear over the phone
0got that game booster
bcuz bleed out and die
04hmm
9back live
Call spirit medium
i think thats what you told me
Right, Yuzuru
I THINK.
If the femoral artery is wounded, you bleed out in minutes.
04So a fracture on the back hind leg would be fine, although I assume he'd be left with a limp?
Y7?
Essentially, yes.
wtf...
Oh, this show
And now, best robot.
this show never made much sense to me
Dude is so chill
then again, I never liked mechas
9the only show 4chan unanimously loves
04ok awesome
04thanks guys
MEGA SLUSH!
Look at it like this, a broken leg means the bone is literally broken, a fractured leg means the bone is literally fractured
It can still be used, but too much strain, and snap.
then it becomes broken leg
!?
NOPE

Er... favourite movie.
Same with Peanut and Sathi!
And DCD!
Maybe its simply too hard to choose. :>
>mfw just realized I wasn't even in the soonpyramid ninja battle to begin with
:p
6They all do. Just not on bronystate.co.cc
well... that defeats the point of the /about/ doesn't it?
I was on DinkyPage
6They just don't have favorite movies up... because well, they wouldn't choose one when asked.
fine
Bastards
you?
6But I'll basically add in one whenever they decide.
You should string them up until they answer the question

Hey, I liked Howard the duck!
Octavia likes Howard the Duck. Somehow I expected Octavia to have better taste...
Oh com'on, its a silly classic.
:p
Part of the reason its good is because its bad. lol
Hey sprinkles, how often do you sleep?
Pfft, sleep.
Who has time for sleep when you could be practicing the cello right?

Better, I think...
That pony be CrAzEh
I heard everypony in ponyville is crazy.
This is possible.
And then I said, Oatmeal? are you crazy??- oh
Hiya.
Vinyl Scratch and Rainbow Dash are tied at 2 apiece for moderator favourite pony and not a single vote for Octavia. Thoughts?
Make that a three way tie with Twilight Sparkle.
Oatmeal! And yeah, me sad. :'(
Everyone knows deep down they luv me. ;)
I'd probably appreciate you more if you didn't remind me of how horribly I did in my music classes. :/
Awww, I'm sorry. Keep practicing! Maybe you can still get the hang of it.
stupid... internet... grah
I haven't played an instrument in 9 years now.
It took me many many years of diligent practice and work to become so good.
Ouch.
Playing is such fun. And can be nice and relaxing too.
I stopped when music was no longer a required class.
Ahh.
I'm talking irl too, since I do play the violin, cello, drums, and DJ a little irl. lol
Heh
I sorta played the flute for 3 years in elementary school because it was the smallest instrument and therefore the easiest to carry home for practice.
I've always just been really musical. I cant remember a time I wasnt drumming on anything I could find.
And of course then I never bother to sign it out.
Ahh, the flute. Nice. I've played the flute a tiny bit, but not enough to be good at it.
I actually didnt evne play instruments much in school. I mostly played outside of school.
Well, I'm out for tonight. Have a goodnight everypony.
Later!
sleep?
pfft.
I'll sleep when I'm dead.
I don't recally anyone mentioning sleep...
And I'm sure what you meant was "I'll sleep when the caffiene wears off." :p
>mfw just drank 2 more sodas
correction:
>yfw
:P
You're almost as bad as Dermathil.
same here. Sleep is for the living-impaired.
what? XD
didn't Dermathil go to bed three hours ago? :p
Probably, but he also mentioned the giant bottle of pepsi he had just finished.

I think I tried a TouchPad at the NEX, it's ok
/me finishes off his last coke for "today"
I prefer the Galaxy Tab to it for the Android OS
03well yeah, I figured for that price it would be worth it
There were 3 that were available at the NEX: Samsung Galaxy Tab, HP TouchPad, and Toshiba something
hey again sprinkles
6Hey.
I recently got a tablet, I'm on it now
What kind?
how often do you sleep?
03if you say iPad
Acer Iconia a100
03I'm going to murder ou
03*you
03oh
03OK
03XD
03I still don't get the tablet hype, but whatever
I'll high five you
Once a day
>_>
I considered an ipad at one point but this was $200 cheaper I think
It's more for convenience, portability, and leisure than it is a full-on computer
I'm just asking based on something I heard awhile back
Do you know any stats?
03that's why you get a netbook.
?
Specs?
Yeah
what was the something?
Oh god what I'd this my I RC client id is accidentally itself
That Sprinkles isn't actually human.
6I'm a robot.
and that he sleeps for about 3 hours, once a week.
What? 0__o
6I sleep like, once every other day usually... like, max.
6And even then it's only for 4-6 hours.
wow.
7" screen, 1.0 ghz nVidia Tegra CPU,,
How do you do it?
uh.
6Insomnia.
oh.
Also mycursor isn'toving right like it should
6Like, actual insomnia, not the "I live on the internet and have no life" kind.
6Though I have that too.
what.
yeah.
I understand.
I also can't see most of my text.
and lol.
I can pull off that first kind, but I don't think I could do it for any extended period of time.
Can you function on that little sleep?
Does it run Android?
6When I go to try to sleep, it takes me at the very least two hours.
6And I've gotten used to it..
1GB ram, 8 gb rom with micro SD card slot
yes
Ok
6Your brain needs 2 hours of a certain level of sleep per day to function properly.
6I get it all at once when I sleep.
6Like, I go immediately into it.
hmm, that's interesting.
6So when I first wake up, I'm a lot more attentive than some people are most of their day.
Also, drf, did you read what I said regarding tablets?
So anything below that, you (as in anyone) are brain-dead pretty much?
The thing is, I really mostly wanted to try the Android platform more than anything
6Pretty much.
/me is a zombie if he's forced to get up early
03yes I did
which is why I got this tablet
6It's the type of sleep you get right before you start dreaming.
6And that's why, Dashite.
03<Pattyrick> It's more for convenience, portability, and leisure than it is a full-on computer
03> that's why you get a netbook.
6You're body's used to getting that type of sleep at that time of day.
12Back
Wb GL
03EW IPOD TOUCH
So, what are the other 5 hours of sleep for?
12Thanks :3
*6
I mean that aren't contract phones.
12drf
(based on an 8 hour sleeping schedule)
6No. Idea. Probably just your brain preparing for it...
03what
6*shrug*
12Just look at a iPad and say that to it
I liked my iPod touch to be honest.
12It's not going to care. At all
/me is going to try that
6Since, normally your brainwaves go through a few different stages when sleeping, and that last stage before you start dreaming is what you NEED.
I like my iPod touch, but iPhone (while a lot more expensive) has some great improvements
6I highly recommend you don't.
6Ever.
awww..... -_-
6You miss too much and it will FUCK with your mind.
3G capability is probably the biggest advantage
6People wonder why I'm a little bit nuts.
6That's why.
But I can't get a contract phone.
12lol
You don't seem nuts to me? atleast not online.
12Every phone has 3G now days XD
In fact you seem like one of the more sane people here.
03there's nothing remotely good about an iPhone :|
no they don't
mine doesn't
6That's mostly because I have outlets for the crazy.
You should come over here and get an iPhone without one :P
03some even have 4G :P
it's a tracfone
also 4G isn't 4G
4G isn't developed yet
12Any phone that is capable of having the internet has 3G
03yes, but it's faster 3G :P
6I've learned to control it, since I've been doing it for YEARS.
It's not a sleep schedule you want to try to have. It really gets to you after a little while.
03no./
It's available, but not widespread enough for everyone to be able to use it
6Yeah, I can't sleep well at all.
03it may not be true "4G", and I agree that it's just cellphone companies being evil and forcing people to try to upgrade, but it still exists
03and it is fast
6The only time I really sleep well is when I CRASH.
Mine can get on the internet and it doesn't have 3G
12Well, if it's a smart phone at least
6Like, this is my ...fourth? all-nighter this week.
03>wi-fi
Mine "firs" under "smart" phone
6But I function just fine as far as work goes.
fits*
12What OS does it have?
my phone can't get Wi-Fi
My sleep schedule is completely shot because I tend to stay up way too late which is allowed because I don't really have anything I need to be doing during the day right now.
Apple works with developed technologies (although here in Italy even 3G is unreliable xD)
6As long as you're getting something...
03Apple is a pile of crap
Java.
03they don't even let third party developers have a say
12Give it up drf :p
03why don't you
Please
wow, sprinkles. That's insane, man.
Depends upon your definition of "smartphone"
6I know the problems with how I live... =/ I have to take in a lot of B vitamins, it really helps.
6Yeah, the running joke is I'll be dead before I hit 30, the way I live.
D:
6I get no sleep, I chain smoke, I used to drink... a lot.
12How old is your phone Zoroark?
Yeah drf, let's just agree to disagree and talk about something less arguable :P
uh, a few months.
I've never smoked before. Don't really plan to.
12Ah
:V
What kind of phone?
it's a prepaid phone
LG something.
If anything I think I might be getting too much sleep. It's just way too easy to roll over and go back to sleep in the mornings and I end up more tired after doing so that I would have been if I had just got up in the first place.
What carrier?
12lol patty XD
tracfone.
Never heard of them
03I have
03they're crap
12I have, they're pretty good
:|
03Zoroark
I did that the first half of the summer, then I started getting an averave of about 6-7 a night and I've found that is the ideal amount for me.
03you should look into VIrgin Mobil,e Prepaid
Not my decision.
03I helped my friend out there, you can buy an Android smartphone for $200 and get unlimited talk/text/internet for $25 a month.
Parents etc.
Hold on restarting client.
I personally prefer simple, prepaid phones to smartphones
12lol
03eh
12Ever heard of prepaid smartphones?
03Smartphones are actually really useful
03prepaid is dumb
03I mean
6Also, never stay up more than 60 hours at a time, and I really don't even recommend even 48 to be honest.
Brb
like running out of battery quicker!
12k
03with Android, it's possible to hack some stuff and basically get free 3G without actually paying for it.
03:)
so, no 72 hour challenge?
6I am NEVER staying up the 106 hours again.
6I will DIE.
Ouch
I was going to try that next weekend.
6I hold the ponychan record, last I checked.
And sprinkles
Holy fuck!
106 hours??
I think the most I've done is around 40 hours.
6The hallucinations. THE HALLUCINATIONS.
Okay now I can tell what I'm typing.
12Well, Virgin Mobile gives you all the free 3g data you want
6OH MY GOD THEY WILL HAUNT ME FOREVER.
Fault that be ;)
Or wait, nvm
That was bad enough. I can't imagine staying up more than twice that.
6My brain was fried.
6For like, three days afterwards.
6It was BAD.
/me pats Sprinkles
I do like this tablet though.
6The hallucinations were just... horrible.
12Welcome back Zoroark :3
Seems nice.
Thanks.
I really hate to ask, but its got me wondering. what hallucinations?
6Especially considering I walk everywhere.
12Anything acer is nice
I like usefulness of smartphones, but I want a phone as a phone
Not a small computer as my phone
uh
6You start getting hallucinations as soon as 40 hours, though for some people it takes a bit longer. Mine kicked in at 50, and got worse, and worse.
huh.
12I want a computer that can act as a phone :)
Wb Zoroark
03you can do that.]
12I know
6I was talking to an imaginary spider for the last 7 hours.
what the hell
03ever heard of those mini PCI express cards that you can put in laptops that give you 3G anywhere?
03then just use Google Voice.
my client is reconnecting
6And I'm not talking a small spider.
That being said, they have introduced a lot of technology that makes calling better
while I'm connected
6I'm talking a spider the size of a table.
what is this
What client do you use?
6That much time without sleep will fuck you up.
AndroIRC.
6I'm still not the same as I was. I'm a bit more, jumpy.
12That sounds pretty awesome @drf
Hmmm
>talking to a spider the size of a table
you walk everywhere as in you don't drive?
like to work and stuff?
"OMG, please don't eat me!"
I just kind of picked something and went with it
6I don't drive because my car is broken down.
That would be cool drf, but
6And work isn't that far away.
6It's like, an hour walk.
It hasn't messed up like this before...
oh god not
-t
6Which, for the area, is nothing.
Perhaps one of the main reasons I prefer tablets to netbooks/laptops is the trackpad and keyboard
03tablets don't actually have keyboards.
03and I hate trackpads
6No, Dashite, I was talking to the spider as in having a conversation... I don't remember what most of it ended up being about.
03give me a real mouse any day fo the week
03*of
I think an hour walk in any direction except north east would take me outside of town.
6It was at the point that I realized I was talking to an imaginary spider that I went FUCK THIS IMMA SLEEP NOW.
Tiny, inaccurate trackpad that has to be scrolled a million times to get your mouse where it needs to be
6And the fact that it took me seven hours to realize that says something.
I'm probably going to take this thing back and get a new desktop with the money
03that's why you use an ACTUAL MOUSE
03I know, groundbreaking, right?
and tiny keyboards on netbooks
6brb have to restart comp
And what does a mouse require?
ok
Flat, stable surface
03a USB port, which all netbooks have?
03nope
03not if you have a laser mouse
greenist.
Not always accessible while on the go
03you can literally use that on the back fo your hand
03*of
XD
Still, if you don't have a very good surface, a mouse is useless
03nope
It's much easier to just tap
Or swipe
03I actually use the surface of my laptop for a mouse LOL
vhcgfgfdstyuhghui
09,08EYERAPE
berb again
feelin like OJ Simpson.
Been accused of a crime, and I'm not sure if I actually did it or not.... but i'ma go with not, cause that's easier
thank ghed inane lugia isn't here, ae?
Sure, touchscreen keyboards aren't accurate if your hand isn't perfect
o_O
Or great for that matter
But it's convenient
Easy
crime would be using all 40kb/s of this connection while my aunt tries to play her stupid game.
03well
03what you should get, then
apart from trackballs which I can't use because my hand shivers,
03is one of those hybrid netbooks/tablets, where the screen flips around and can be used as a full touch screen
what kind of stupid game?
trackbuttons are the most annoying thing.
That would be convenient
uhh. It's like the fairy bubbles game on neopets...
03they do make them
03my friend has one
Cept it's not on neopets
these iny quarter-inch thingies on some laptops
?
03it's called a Lenovo Ideapad I think
Any recommendations?
they take forever to do anything
Ok
I've basically been using this tablet for all the things I used to use my iPod touch for
03a method to test a hammer?
To me it just feels like a bulkier version of a phone, minus the phone
You've owned an iPod touch, right drf?
iPod touch is not a method. Smash it on the ground day is a method.
get it right (tm)
03I've used one, I would never buy one
Zoroark, which iPod touch gen so you have?
03if someone gave me one, I'd either destroy it or sell it
1st and 4th
Ok
ew
03I'm not cool with the whole "only one button" thing
03you know how inconvenient that is?
03I mean, sure, virtual buttons are fine, but when the app FREEZES, you're kinda up the creek without a paddle
There are 4 buttons, drf
03no.
not particularly
03there's just the big one
03volume doesn't count
top button
03you mean power?
Yes it does, it's a physical button
power/sleep
03yeah, but if it freezes, those buttons don't do anything
03and I mean, at least with my phone, I can take the battery out if it freezes that badly.
hold down both, obtain reset
03no.
03iPods don't have removable batteries
03not unless you happen to carry around a set of screwdrivers with you
Big deal
HOLD THE POWER BUTTON
03that doesn't always work
03I knew someone with an iPhone, that thing froze, and we tried holding down power for like 20 minutes
ipods ensure that will work.
03nothing happened
03nope.
03not if they BREAK
oh?
03we literally had to sit there and wait for the battery to die.
By the time your iPod/Phone/Pad's battery has died, it'll probably need to be upgraded anyways
lol
03yes, because they totally need to be updated every 6 hours..
Ol drf
03if it freezes, the backlight stays on = no power saving
so does wintrash.
Did you know how to properly reset it?
03yep
03I googled it
03it didn't work
i don't update anything. unless i have a reason.
03again, if it BREAKS, all of those steps are USELESS
You hold down both power and home button
03the only 100% guaranteed way is to pull the battery out
03and since the iPod battery is soldered in, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
>implying updating every 6 hours isn't a law of technology
03LOL
Did you do the proper way or just the lock button, drf?
can't type fast
03I tried everythign
03all like four methods
03see, Pattyrick
longest restart ever.
03the button combinations aren't actually hardwired in
12Anyways, what's up Zoroark? :3
03so if the OS freezes, it doesn't even know you're pressing the buttons
/me puts leash on Umbreon and avoids ownership.
03so it's USELESS
12..
12XD
Not much.
03You basically have to take the battery out or cut the power off somehow
03Yes.
12Yep
03At least on all the phones I've seen, I don't know about tablets
Tablets, too?
wb zune?
Not all, but most.
03there's a battery drawer
03yeah, what Zoroark said.
03but this is why I do my research before buying things.
I can't remove mine.
also
03all of the Motorola Droids have batteries that can be removed
this tablet has a total of 3 physical buttons
and a switch
03mine has an entire keyboard. LOL
I do like the Droid, but I'm not in an area of the world that offers them
03so that's what, like at least 30 keys? :P
03Pattyrick, what?
03you should be able to buy Motorola phones in any European country
03they're just called different names
03Motorola Milestone is the European Droid
Physical keyboard is good, but smal
I haven't seen it at my Vodafone store
..... yawn.
03yes, but it's going to be small even if you use the touchscreen keyboard.
03well
Yeah
03not being able to buy it at an actual store != it's not available
03you could probably order it from their website
sleepy?
Wimp!
Perhaps I just need to look more carefully
03wtf

03they have lots of them :P
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Edge of The World by Faith No More" -
yep, laptop on bed.
What's most annoying about this tablet is that the home "button" isn't a button.
eeyup same here
Btw, I'm not super ultra mega interested in it
soooo comfortable......
12It's a hot key? I think that's pretty awesome tbh
That's one thing about some Android tablets
uh?
03well, on my Droid, the buttons are attached to the screen, but they respond on their own
03like even if the app freezes, it seems to work XD
it's a capacitive "button"
03yeah
03and the slide-out keyboard has a search button and a menu button
03no home, thoughl.
03-l
03oh, it also has the back button
Listening to this right now http://theophany-rmx.bandcamp.com/album/crystal-flash-ep
12[02:22] <Zoroark> it's a capacitive "button" <-- Pretty much the same thing
Which annoys me because I expect some kind of tactile response, like my phone or the iPhone.
03tactile meaning what, it vibrates?
03as my phone does that.
03it's an option that you can turn on and off.
sleepy time for Polarfire. night bros
As in I can feel where it is
03oh
night Polarfire
03well it lights up
Bbl, breakfast
03so unless you lose your eyesight
03you should know where it is
03LOL
03I mean, I admit. Nothing is perfect
03my phone isn't either
It lights up after I find it lopl
03hence why I'm looking into new phones
12You'll get used to it XD
03mine lights up as long as the backlight is on
I have literally searched for it
mine doesn't
03and the nice thing about having a keyboard
03is you can just flip the keyboard out and back in to activate the backlight
12drf, you should make your own brand called dUrf
/me RUNS
03No.
02bbl
02=w=
03but I HAVE seen ANdroid phones with the four physical buttons
12Yeah, I have too
03opposed to just one that iPhone has
03because yes, power and volume are separate
03I have seen some without back buttons, but they always have home/menu/search
03even tablets
03they're hotwired into the OS
03or hard-wired, whatever you want to call it
12What do you think of this phone? http://www.virginmobileusa.com/cell-phones/motorola-triumph-phone.jsp
12I'
12I've been thinking about buying one myself XD
/me waits for the site to load
03my Internet is being dumb right now
12lol
03yeah that looks good, besides the lack of a physical keyboard
12Yeah, that's how virginmobile.com is :|
03I'md ebating between the Droid 3 and some 4G phone :/
12Ah
12Is the 4G phone the Epic, or another motorola?
03sadly, the Epic isn't available on Verizon
03that's the dilemma, none of the Verizon 4G phones have keyboards :/
12Too bad lol
03I was thinking like the HTC Thunderbolt or something
12HTC makes some pretty powerful phones
03yeah
12Lol I borrowed my brothers android, and I’ve been wanting one ever since :|
12It’s a Samsung intercept
03yeah, that's what my friend has

CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES.
Advice: Should I pre-order Dead Island as a digital or retail copy?
Steam.
I'm not a fan of digital.
PS3
I like having a physical copy.
Problem is, DRM.
inb4 me making a random pop culture reference
Myeah, I prefer having a physical copy, too.
Me too
or well, I prefer both, I guess, if I get it for the same price...
Wish more games did that.
That's why I mostly get steam games
The only DRM is Steam itself
I really don't like gaming today (PC gaming more) as publishers are putting more restrictions on it and taking control of games away from end users.
FreezeFrame, that's not always true.
Need to find a AA battery before I can really play anything
Steam games can have extra DRM.
Ex: Ubisoft games.
Even the Steam games had the always-on DRM.
There are some others.
That's true... and really obnoxious of Ubisoft, btw.
Cool story bro.
Ubisoft is stupid. Money does that to you.
True
And that's also why I'll never buy their games on PC...
I don't buy their games at all.
I refuse to support a company that supports such a ridiculous measure
And if I was ever gifted an Ubisoft game on PC, I'm cracking the DRM out.
Eh, no extra DRM on my PS3 games. I mean I know there's DRM, but nothing that keeps me from playing my own game.
Capcom uses always-on DRM on their PS3 digital titles.
In fact, I think a few do.
That's true, some PSN and XBLA games have that, even from other publishers.
I really don't like consoles anymore after Sony exercised their rite to remove a console feature.
Linux, you mean?
or "Other OS"
Yeah.
Hi, all
Yeah that sucked, true
I didn't update my PS3 for months until it was stolen.
Also sucks with no backwards compatibility.
Granted, OtherOS wasn't great, but it was there, and it was unfair to strip it away as a lazy tactic to deal with an undisclosed "security concern."
Older PS3s have BC.
Mine does.
Well, not here.
Newer ones don't.
It was stripped for cost.
hello everybody :)
I know that, but from what I hear it wasn't available here at all.
Hmm.
Not that it matters, I have a Slim, so I wouldn't have it anyway :P
Blame Sony.
hey insano
06ohai Insane_Lugia
And not that it matters yet again, because I really don't want shitty slowed down PAL versions of games :P
I need to get around to finishing negotiating a trade with a friend who has a BC one.
He needs to ditch his because the only output that works is HDMI and he doesn't have an HD set
You can fix that.
I figure I can trade him mine so he can fix the yellow light.
Nittany: No, this is an actual problem. A friend of ours has the death touch for computers... and he touched it.
Has he tried resetting his console to factory default?
Nope, but I'm not going to remind him :D
I really don't want to do a solder reflow.
It's actually just holding a button down.
No, I meant on mine.
I know how to do a factory reset.
Oh ok.
I did it on mine a couple times before I got my HD set
havent seen him for a week

Ohai Allis
10"In short, I'm out of there for good. Not like I'll be blocking all communication, haha. There's still here, dA, Steam, and a couple other places where I can talk to all the friends I made there. The community revolves too heavily around the chat, anyways, and I felt the need to cut off those ties before the end of this month. I'm aware of it. Joining there was probably one of my best moves on the internet, but I've felt that I've bee
10Whoops, pasted that backwards, but oh well
10It was on another shoutbox
Thank god for FiM, otherwise right about now I'd be in the fetal position on my bed
Hi AiZ
well if he felt it was too chat heavy why didn't he try joining the chat?
Hey AllisZero
also fluttershy was pretty new member
06Perhaps he prefers forums? .P
WUT Allis?
what's wrong Allis?
it's not that i have "no reason" to leave. it's more the fact i've already made a bad name for my-self. so ijust simply xclude my self from the group due to past behaveours. this wouldn't be the first group i get up and leave.
this was fluttershys reason =\
Yeah, what's wrong?
For about 6 weeks before and 1-2 after my birthday everything just about sucks
yeah, but why he still felt reason to leave the forum cos of chat puzzles me.
hmm
Know the feeling
10Dunno
Yep.
However, for me it's been two years
Know that time of the year you think back on your life and regret some decisions you've made?
Oh, yeah!
And worry about what'll be of the future? Yeah, it's that time
definitely
Myeah.
10That was almost 2 weeks ago
That's like a lot more than one time per year.
10August 11
could of had the decency to add me elsewhere >.<
For me it's every year, so at least I've got some ponies to obsess over and take my mind away from it
Just came out of a period like that, it sucks, man.
If he only gets that feeling once a year, he should feel lucky
Oh, naw, it happens more often, trust me
hmm
I've been like that a lot these past few days.
Ponies helped me a lot towards the end of it
But before my birthday, it's just a constant six weeks of fuuuu

Last month, I was in financial trouble. This month, I'm in a worse kind of trouble.

im just upset how i just barely make friends with somebody and they up and leave. it hurts.
I'm just hungry, that's all.
Over the summer, I didn't have the job and ran out of money to pay my monthly rent in July.
i know im still new and all but its the princeable
I'm naturally a negative person so what I say may be biased by that, but
So I applied to a few places and hoped for the best.

ROBOTPINKEMENA IS BACK!
10He mentioned having a Steam account too, but I'm not very familiar with that site so I couldn't help you there
i dont have a a account. i never made 1 because inever had any friends on it nor had a reason to make one =\
But sometimes you have no way out. This is how I felt that overtime week.
I did have a way out, though.
Just didn't take it.
james had me make a steam account to talk to him via instant but he never messaged me and the lack of instructions didnt help either
I didn't need the money anymore like I did before.
plus james profile is private so i couldnt medg him
But I didn't quit out of pride.
If you have some pride in you and don't want to let people down (including yourself which is usually added unknowingly), then it becomes hard to make that decision
Exactly.
DON'T DO IT ROBOTPINKIE!
well you have some drawings Insane, why not make a DA account? lots of us here have one :3
I went through that when my internship turned into a full-time job, except for about 40% less than the average for someone in my position
Do what?
OHGODNO
because Insane spyro did them drawings for me an sent them to me in the mail. spyro has a da account an has already uploaded them.
And old study found that 90% of people hate their jobs.

Ewww, Pegacorn... I told you not to eat them, seriously.
Phew, it's not Fluttershy. Alright. Move on
THIS IS BAT COUNTRY.

10Those are my watchers :P
80 MB/s transfer speeds over gigabit ethernet, like a boss?
lol
I love bats, they're adorable.
Um.....why do you still have your hacksaw RobotPinkie?
I... don't remember....
The plot thickens.
why?
FFF-
I didn't know Alt F+4 would close the java window. Great.
GASP
ALLIS IS SPY!
Is this raspberry jam on the hacksaw?
/me licks hacksaw to confirm
10YouTube, ah
...oh, this isn't jam...
im refering to youtube and facebook btw
Ah I see
What is it then?
You don't want to know.
I can do a very good Jigsaw.
yeah I do get annoyed when my inbox on DA is flooded with too many pics
I have done it once.
inb4 I WANT TO PLAY A GAME
It's not game time.
What time is it then?
It's pony time, of course
Party time.
ive saved over 500 different photos of lugia on my facebook. 3 albums =\
I'm thinking of a Saw crossover. I know exactly who would play the game.
i enjoy looking at them... but, i dont care to see repets which is why i did it.
In fact, it's 80% written in my head.
Not me, I only have a PS3.

Unlike weather stories, I don't think Saw stories have been done.
You mean fanfic?
Yeah.
If they were done, they were probably on the later flicks. I think the earlier ones make for better starting points.
The later ones were more gorefests.
by the way, today is a good day for me. i feel settled and not hyped. so i shouldnt be too off topic today :)
The earlier ones were more psychological.
anybody like lil wayne?
I enjoyed them all, but I consider #4 the peak of the series.
And #5 the lowpoint.
10Me
This sketch might actually work
10Good to know you listen to something other than death metal :P
I don't like the pose too much though
i like all sorts and not just death metal. blood drunk and deathklock are the only 2 deathmetals i know. im not really a fan my self but deathklock i fave.
Know what, I should go buy a new chair.
as for blooddrunk, i love the album art mor ethen the music.
Let's see... 5 hours per night, five nights a week is 25 hours, 12+ hours, usually, on weekends, so I'm typically sitting here for almost 50 hours a week
Wow, someone else who doesn't hate the Saw movies. I am shocked.
Yeah, that's probably why my neck is a mess by the end of Sunday
10k, so why did you ask about Lil Wayne?
lol this mornin i woke up and one of lil wayne's songs was playing in my head. now i can't remebr what one it was.
10How did it go?
WHO'S GONNA PLAY THE GAME?
I lost.
Kinda think Saw 6 was the low point, though, but I haven't seen Saw 3D...
lol Ziltoid just played, Pegacorn.
Ziltoid: Damn it
Hi everyone
hey Ziltoid
Saw 3D (A.k.a. The Final Chapter) is nothing great.
i think i will start uploading more songs to my playlist on my tst profile.
It doesn't put a good end to the series.
and how did what go.
10The song
Anyone else saw this article? http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/societe/201108/18/01-4427068-intrigantes-pouliches-dans-les-rues-de-quebec.php#Slide-5-box-0
oh, i cant rember lol. i think it was let it rock but not positive
But you think I should watch it?
10That's by Kevin Rudolph
10.w.
Can't read French but that's funny
nah, i mean the let rock version of lil wayne.
If you have Chrome it can translate it.
If you've seen the rest, sure.
10Lil Wayne is featured in it
lol oh yeah, unfortunately not G4 ponies :P
Vigilante ponies
Can't read french but I get the idea, more or less, what's being said
I wonder if RobotPinkemena will return. (trololololo)
oh, ok. i see now.
(Quebec) Have you noticed the fillies? Yes, this colorful toy. They are hanging from electric son

There's no (Physics bending warning) compression of water out of vapor due to a high pressure wave there.
I never get tired of sonic rainbooms.
the video is super weird but also pretty neat to look at because its different.
Well no, but I've never seen anything like it, still. :P
Not much is going on,except that when i play L4D2,i get achievements.
If they were real, I'd get funding to study them.
Oh god the neighbors are in my backyard
/me cracks open a beer
And I'm wearing my Homer Simpson pajamas
To be honest, the only "mystery" is the added energy needed to pull water out of the vapor phase, and that's a thermo equation.
Cheers, ponies
Thanks buzzkillington, we'll still choose to ignore the science and say it's magic!
Energy being pulled out of a pressure wave.
Rainbows are made in a factory in Equestria...
Well sorry I have a physics degree. :p
Just thought I'd point that out. :P
lol it's alright, I'm studying physics right now.
10Song is okayish
I like physics, quite a bit
I'm studying meteorology, too.
I just never had a knack for it in school
Rainbows aint physics Rainbows is rainbows
Science.
I'm not going to buzzkill the show physics.
Right now we're studying optics, so rainbows are relevant. :P
In fact, it would be fun to back it up.
i like how its little hip hop mixed with soft rock
True.
they lyrics icould care less for due to it being depressing
like the costume vid :)
That picture has massive potential for trollage, you know that right
10Somehow I think I made myself hate soft rock lolol
Which one?

10Used to love it, now I prefer hard/metal/whatever else
hmm, well from my observances, you only hate what you choose to if you like it or not. its all state ofmind.
lol yeah
(Well, until one anon decides to make the calculations of how much energy it takes to send a car flying three stories with just a quarter)
the videos with lyrics on my play list, are more of what iam in to
takes the same amount of energy with a brick, a cannon, or a massive slingshot
(And the fact that the quarter would disintegrate before it reached the car at the required velocity)
just much more concentrated
clearly there would have been a sonic rainboom if this plane had just passed the sound barrier, though....
Ohai SilverMane
hey SilverMane

i mean hey Pegacorn and Robotpinkie
If you converted the right amount of mass in the quarter to energy...

Alright friends, I'm gonna go do something useful, put some ice on my neck etc, before I spend 4 hours with my eyes glued to Firelands
i do like some of their songs but it dont mean i like all of them. i fave eminem if i had to choose. he has the largest list of liked songs out of any other artice
I have no idea what that means.
Alright, AllisZero
See you later
suddenly, mobileDCD is logged in
10So you like rock/rap hip-hop stuff, it appears
/me jumps up and then smashes down right in front of SilverMane.
@Lamemeter Rarity
6 Rarity is 40% Lame. (1595)
I think I'm going to install Morrowind...
overall yes but rap is eww.... i like the rap that involves hip hop and little rock mix.
i just looked at the Nightly Roundup. what about it?
the rap where all they do is talk to a beat = annoying
RobotPinkie, I did that, and it was... boring. After Oblivion, i'm spoiled
can't ever go back
Eh, I feel the opposite way.
the newspaper article about a lady hanging ponies on phone lines/electric wires, did you see it?
lil wayne is a good example. hes a raper but has a good beat+hiphop in it.
I can't stand the epic level 40 sandcrabs in Oblivion
epic level... sandcrabs?
10I see
but ya Dermathil, i did
I mean it's a great game in so many ways, but I can't enjoy it for very long thanks to the leveling system.
what about it?
Dat be my city
And I get that very newspaper every morning.
so you have crazy pony ladies in your town
honestly ive got no idea how to explainw hat i like with out getting the wrong idea.
I don't know how I missed that article
I couldn't get into Morrowind.
Tried twice. Couldn't get into it.
10Like, you don't want to listen to too much of one genre
I like that Morrowind kicks you in the nuts and steps on your face if you try to go to somewhere you're not equipped for. :P
naioled it
nailed it*
10You like variety
10as do I
RobotPinkie, the slow energy regain rate, difficulty walking places, and horrendously involved talking system made teh game real slow for me
RAAAAAAAAAAR
10I am willing to try most genres, apart from classical/jazz stuff
oh my gosh by usher is prob one of my faves due to how he sings with the beat.
plus, combat felt a little... bland, after oblivion
although the dungeons did feel like a crawler from P&P times
/me randomly rushes at SilverMane and smashes him into the ground
ever heard "gotta get away from you"?
Pegacorn, you know i'm immune to knock-down attacks
It has its problems, Silvermane, but I just can't handle the leveling system in Oblivion. If I'm maxed out, I shouldn't have a problem just punching out a tiny crab with one blow.
also, did you guys see that Trixie comic on EQD?
10The Offspring?
lol yeah
No.
yes
10Yep
Unless I forgot I saw it.
at 1:20 is where i take intrest inthe song.
I think it's fairly likely to happen, really. They know Trixie has a big fanbase, and people want to see more of NMM
10That's where they start to think
10to sing*
10Odd typo
yes, that is somethign like what ilook for in differnt songs. i love how offspring sings there.
it would be... such an awesome episode
The Fall of Trixie
but it's simply too... mature, grimdark even
plus I think people would go crazy with teh mad if Luna got a bad case of NMM again.
Nightmare Trixie?
ORLY SilverMane?
Just saw it.
how do you like porn star danceing?
I would go nuts if Luna fell again.
what needs to happen honestly, is a spin-off series targeted directly at us, if they want to ensure they never lose us. I mean i love the innocence and youthful games of the current, but some darkness to pervade an innocent world? take my money
It makes sense, Trixie wants people to revere her for her power, NMM is probably looking for someone to inhabit.
10Where have I heard that before, is it a band or song?
If she wasn't "killed" in Ep 2.
http://www.youtube.com/user/elvarg72?feature=mhee#p/f/9/hP_wjflirPM
I don't think it's too dark, they can do it with the same mood as Friendship is Magic 1&2
Which I know there are hints of that.
I don't know, Nightmare's existance is only explored in fanfics
Well, I can dream, anyway. :P
ehem "al" songs with lyrics in my faves on youtube are songs i love. i hate to spamm my page with crap id on;t like XD
i don't like*
we don't know if it was an existential being that corrupted Luna, or the inner darkness that inhabited her, or perhaps simply herself being dramatic and whatnot
g'morning gents
allo
10Hm
and if I might interrupt the conversation:
Ohai ValtheJean
'sup ValtheJean
I believe Faust did say it was possession
SilverMane: Actually, Faust confirmed that Nightmare Moon was more than just Luna
^
howdy Silvermane, Pegacorn and RobotPinkie :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFOXBWPY8I I'm not into cosplaying myself, but I would LOVE to have that costume
[1,0You0,4Tube]: Shadow Lugia Dancing | by WizardGir | Length: | Views: 16 067
Yeah, I think she did, Val
oh really? must have missed that one.
It was in a DA comment
it's a really obscure one
I've only seen it once or twice
well, if it was possession, then there's a good chance for a recurring
i know nobody here cares a bout runescape b ut... anybody know the name of this song? i would love to add it to my list <3 http://www.youtube.com/user/elvarg72?feature=mhee#p/f/31/9ojYFwi-zVQ
well
she is confirmed for season 2 (luna that is)
which would be nice, as we need a new conflict arc
hey Ghosties
so long as there's no god damn Nyx, I'll be happy
I wouldn't mind them getting some influences from G1 in that sense.
oh ValtheJean, you and your hatred of things i know little about
ohai Ghosties
lol
She's a fanfic character
that shadow lugia is rilly at a-kon
and she's been taking over ponychan
like seriously
10Sounds like Disturbed, Insane
which is why she'll never show up
10Hey Ty
more than Spiderman, Gary Oak, and Nigel combined
just like SOCKS
4Hey everyone
06i DO have a runescape ACC.... but didn't touch it in months
7hey
Hey Ghosties
well, I could easily see them have a background character put on socks for the fan squees
whereas Nyx, dear god no
'sup RBD, welcome back Sathi
brb,gptta eat.
socks, the Lyra x Bonbon, Nyx, Midnight, Trixie's origins (mother, sister, etc) and Derpy Hooves family
im lvl 137 if you need help on quest, killing monsters, anti crash, etc.
none of those things will show up, sadly
Is this some kind of mod intervention for our discussion? :P
just halla at me
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I want Derpy and Dinky :(
7bewareeeee
/me surprise glomps RainBroDash
ill check out distrubed see what ig et
Derpy Hooves: They gave her derpy eyes, we gave her a family
I hope Derpy gets her own episode
I do not RobotPinkie, unfortunately
I mean her name will be Ditzy Doo, but whatever
she is confirmed for at least being a minor char, rather than merely a cameo
I like her as a background pony that is like a "Where's Waldo" thing
she even has a speaking role
if they made her more than just appearances, they run the risk of upsetting the fandom for "portraying her wrong"
ung...
aaaaaaand the end has begun
10Try Stricken
lol, you're so negative :P
10:P
only about everything you like ;)
10:D
she's going to talk normal, but the way we portrayed her in fanfics will last beyond the 'canon' derpy
10well
4Beware? You're in for a scare?
10caramel is worst pony after all
btw, I would SO buy a "Where's Derpy" book (Where's Waldo)
O_o
So you don't want the mane 6 in the show, ValtheJean ? :P
you son of a bitch
lol
The Mane 6 are clearly overrated
needs more Caramel :P
LEAVE LUNA TRIXIE AND FLUTTERSHY AND TWILIGHT AND RARITY ALONE
...yeah, I rest my case :P
you can have the others. EXCEPT OCTAVIA
I'm not sure where it's become a stereotype that I hate everything though
I love many things, like ponies!
But you hate all ponies except Caramel, Val :P
10Maybe not
untrue!
the only pony I hate is Trixie
and Nyz
nyx*
Do you like severe weather?
but Nyx doesn't count
because she isn't real
Okay you like Nyx, but she doesn't count.
and I only say Rainbow Dash sucks because CERTAIN mods like to troll me :P
4Not me
and you have my thanks Ghosties :P
4Too much RD love if you ask me
suddenly ghosties
and my axe, Ghosties!
4*nods*
10and lol valthejean
I'm back
suddenly Rainbrodash
oh RainbroDash, you know I <3 you
Suddenly Seymour
I just hate the things you do :P
this is one of my fave techno's http://www.youtube.com/user/elvarg72#p/f/30/xYygnv09urQ
So you'd say no to a S2 Caramel episode, Val?
it gets good when it picks up
10The voice makes me think Cascada
never heard of cascada
10Pop/Dance singer
10Anyway, this song you linked is more Dance than techno
hmm maybe. after 2:40 is where i start to really like it.
in that sexy, sultry accent of his
Well, that depends
and i'll be back; going to go get food
dat SilverMane
see, if the episode basically confirmed every aspect of fanon I've created for him, I would fangasm so hard the eather's continents would reshape
if it were anything else (which it most likely would be) then no
inb4 Silvermane episode... I'd die if that happened
lol
SO you're hoping Caramel has no lines in S2, pretty much?
i don't have an ego, what are you talking about >.>
pretty much
I mean I can understand that
but for example
if it saw him and Toffee visiting the cake shop
I would Squee
very manly Squees mind you, but squee nontheless
all of our fanfic-based personalities are never to be; so i'll never get my Twixie ship with baby Midnight
10Darude - Sandstorm would be a good example of techno
All my fanon will come to pass, though.
nor wise, but word-confused Derpy
i have that one and ive heard it so much im over it lol
well see, this is why derpy shouldn't become a larger character
there are so many interpretations of her
someone is BOUND to be upset by what they make
I trust the FiM team to do her justice, though...
well yeah, I'm sure they'll do fine
I'm just saying *some* people wont like it
disturbed another way to die first 60 secs i love. but after that i dont care for the song.
Well someone is bound to be upset by what the mane 6 do in season 2, so...
I suppose that's fair
I don't think they can please everyone no matter what.
I shall concede to your argument then RobotPinkie :P
10Hell - Disturbed FTW
Spoilers Luna joins the mane 6 in season 2
lol
I gracefully accept your concession :P
inb4 BOOOOOO YEAAAAAAAAAH
If that happened, I'd be very happy, ZIltoid :P
you know, I'm sure this is probably a minority opinion, but I'd like to see more CMC. At the very least, CMC interacting with the mane 6
But really all I want more gummy
I think they did imply a lot about Luna through the first two episodes.
Ohh yeah, I love the CMC episodes from season 1
/me wants more Sweetie Songs <.< >.>
I'm kind of split on whether I want to see them get their cutie marks or not
ewww my frind sent me a song "black and yellow" is the name of it
too much repete
The CMC will never gte their cutie marks
Ever
I mean Sweetie Belle's cutie mark... well that I can see happening.
lol Ziltoid, you remind me of that VGcats comic
10Was it Patrick? I always see him saying that
RANDOM EXPLOSION OUTTA NOWHERE
Sweetie Belles cutie mark should Amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
nah friend on skype
I think it should be a Gospel Choir singer :P
I havnt checked out VGcats in a while
he made a pony comic, but then removed it
http://i929.photobucket.com/albums/ad133/life_mage12/CMCcomic.jpg
That one :P
it's kind of funny actually
Was it Pattyrick?
First panel of latest VGC is 20% cooler than the rest.
if you look at comics prior to that one
Know why he removed it, Val?
he hid ponies in some of the comics
Scott is so damn lazy with that comic.
he "said" he didn't like the quality
LULWUT
but I think he just didn't want people knowing he was a brony
dint know they did an mlp one
which I can respect, but meh
made*
I saw that comic. It wasn't great.
it's probably because he removed it a few hours later
Ah okay
He removed it because he didn't like it.
i like some solja boy. i think his lyrics are funny stuff inthis song. http://www.youtube.com/user/elvarg72#p/f/25/R-qu1ZC-QIs and who is pattyrick?
Really?
but yeah, check the comic where he nostalgias about star trek
look very closely at Aeris' computer screen :P
I thought it was pretty funny.
At the time, I didn't know the comic was based on an episode because I didn't see any of the show yet.
haha
Beware the carrots.
10Pattyrick = Patrick, he goes by Pattyrick on the IRC
so am I the only one who likes to think that Rarity and Sweetie were adopted by Hippie Mules?
lol
Yes, probably. :P
I just think that would be so funny
neve rment him
never ment him
I just saw that.
RBD is hidden in the latest one.
yeah
that's kind of why I think he just didn't want to "come out of the stable" yet
10Soulja Boy, I remember 'Crank That'
"He called me a mule!"
Rarity's parents being mules would be ironic.
well yeah
hallo
He's linked to PMV stuff sometimes, though...
A-CHUCK NORRIIIIIIIIIIIIS!
it's like if you're parents are a certain stereotype or ethnicity, that means you "have the rights" to say jokes about that
hello Barry
albeit slightly covertly
hey Barry
"dunkin on the gang, i looked in the mirror and said whats up, nick nack pattywack give a dog a bone, all work no play, this my playground" i think are funny
So I can only joke about bronies if my parents are bronies?
When I first saw "A Dog and Pony Show," I wonder why the dogs didn't just torture or threaten Rarity into making her shut up.
Time to get to convertin'!
I'm just saying that it's a common societal norm
*wondered
I know, Val
no luck on disturbed with that song i asked a bout earlier a go.

I love these hitler videos
I liked the "Hitler banned from xbox" the most
Me too
THat one is espcially great
If I get to select a B movie, we're watching that movie.
haha
it's actually a pretty good movie
Yeah, that one kinda set it off as a meme
That's the only thing that could keep it from being selected.
well yeah, that's what foreign movies in other languages do :P
I know that it prevented a previous title from being selected.
which one?
Downfall.
Downfall as a B movie I dont think that would qualify
It's the movie that the Hitler memes are based off of.
4There's something of a blurred line
awwwwww

Did you know that EA can take your games away two years after you bought them?
ValtheJean inb4 "like this!" *kick*
Pfft, well anyone can do that, you just have to mash the numbers on your keyboard for a minute and put a % on the end. :P
Dashite, I can't support origin. Due to having 50 games on steam and I can't bear to separate my games more.
It's in Origin's terms.

OH GOD NO SKYLANDERS.
hey Pattcario
70 dollars for the new game, which comes with three characters, then an extra 10 for each character you have to buy to unlock them, which is 27, coming to a grand total of 340 dollars total
I think he's as horny for nameless bald men as I am for ponies.
What did they do to Spyro. ;_________l

Guys, the blood vessel on Dari's forehead is bigger than ever
Because Activision hates you

yay dari
Activision is super-greedy.
/me still has dari on a leash
with all of its black, greedy heart
Dashite_alt, Skylanders: Spyro Adventures.
But everyone forgives them for it because they publish Call of Duty.
Oh
KARMA CHARGER IS COMMING.
I will have to close this when I have visit arriving.
Fucking Skylanders.
then again, the original trilogy and the new trilogy are the only Spyro games that are any good, and the new trilogy is only good due to them using the story I wrote when i was 11
/me cuts Dari's leash loose.
don't worry, I've calculated the trajectory, positioning, wind speeds and Coriolis effect to target you'll land in the pokemon plushie factory
I'm free!

Nittany_Tiger, people forgive the stuff Kotick says? O.o
KARMA ROBOTPINKIE IS ALWAYS WATCHING

the Spyro Legends was dark, like I always wanted, despite happier twist and cartoony bs
Skylanders. ;________________________;
I meant Insane_Lugia o0
Dashite: If they didn't, CoD would be a flop.
07oh
but if you insist! *pings Pattyrick in the catapult too
Thar hurt man!
07I'll tag along too
l0l
we don't need Spyro for kids, they won't appreciate it like us who grew up with Spyro the Dragon
How many of the people that buy CoD have any idea what shit Kotick says?
*That
lucky for me i can fly
Sorry, can't help myself sometimes
Kotick: "I'm charging more for CoD!" People keep buying.
oops nvm forgot had this darn straight jacket on
Not many Dashite
i wasn't even able to BEAT the original trilogy with 100% until i was 16
>implying people who play CoD have brains *trollface*
/me thought he cut it off? xD
A lot of them are kids that pay more attention to advertisements.
>enjoyed CoD4 :(
I miss CoD.
WE'VE GOT TO GET YOUR BRAIN BACK DASHITE
and that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you buy CoD games used...
CALL THE DOCTOR
Enjoyed CoD4 and MW2. :P
>never played multiplayer
I enjoyed the earlier ones.
It's ok RobotPinkie,i brung the Karma Charger in BronyState in the first place.
07SOMEBODY LET HIM OUT OF THE ASSYLUM OMGOMGOMDSOGAFJIOWAUEIRTOU0Q234UI05ERJKGLJLK; *explodes*
Same Dashite
Black Ops, meh. Zombies was fun though.
oh Dari, we already knew you were a mindless drone <3
I've played MW2's MP here and there, and it's a fucking mess.
Also, Russian campaign was best campaign in CoD2
Stream's up.
i'm sad now, because i never beat the enw trilogy of spyro, and i grew up hoping for an evil dragoness that would fight spyro, then get turned good and the shipping would commence
oh NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
and then they did it
Thank you for understanding, Pegacorn
WOOOT
oh dear god! IT'S DURRRRRRRRGARRRRRRRRRR
DURRRRGAAANNN
yes... i told spyro someone cut his straight jacket off of me and he says "ahhh no way! your still too insane to be let loose!" then he put me in a nother one. as for the aslyum... fluttershy decided to let me out.
induring DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGAN
I loved the old CoDs.
Nittany_Tiger: MW2 multiplayer is best because quickscopes. :P
/me sees a Karma Charger in the distance
ah ok :P
wtf am i listening to...
/me flees from the mad lugia! "Halp Police!"
wait...you've got some purple haired guy now?
The last time I played MW2 MP, the other team just harrier spammed us to death.
nonsense, best multiplayer is Portal 2 because it's actually fun to play.
l
did I miss a game of this?
Killstreaks are the worst idea ever.
OHGOD RUN AWAY!
ValtheJean, that's Vehrn
KARMA CHARGER IN THE DISTANCE!
Vehrn...
does he just like adding superfluous letters to every name?
Reward elite players with tools to throw the game out of balance. Brilliant!
/me tackles karma charger out of a 20th storey window. "KARMAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
RobotPinkie, you mean it's fun to screw with your partner by launching them into lasers or removing their light bridge from under them.
It was still fun.
:P
And have them whine about deathstreaks and cheap tricks.
Both, Dashite :P
4Who the fuck is talking?
/me needs to educate Dari on Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
dari
COACH IS BIRD
:P
4Holy mother of god, the fuck is wrong with your voice
Valthejean, you are SOOOOOOOOOOOO old-school.
4You sound like you're croaking
he's a brit, they are all cooky :P
lolwat is dari talking about?
I'm lucky if I can get a 4-kill streak on a match.
Prepare to witness the full might of a Karma Charge.
4Well it's true
@Dermathil and proud of it :P
4No it doesn't, I've spoken to you in Skype
hello
Half-Life 2: Deathmatch? Fuck that! C&C Renegade bitches!
4You don't sound like your sipping on battery acid
hello Batrolinni
Liking a game defines who you are?
And BC2 is just rage fuel for me because the servers insult me for playing badly.
phhhhfff, C&C
/me tackles Nick and carries him over a 80 mile distance.
I'm confused...
4No, it's not
4No, not at all
it's true it is how he talks we even have recordings
ValtheJean, you know it's so much better than Half Life. :p
Dari usually sounds like this during streams
is he talking right now? i can't hear
Dari sounds a little worse right now than normal.
OH GOD
4Dude, seriously, you sound you're 73
Dashite: Ha...ha...AHAHA....AHAHAAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA. Oh god...Oh god my insides hurt
4*like you're
That last sentence wasn't so bad.
LOL
oh lawd
4Maybe
ValtheJean, Half Life 2 is boring.
What is it Val?
>HL2 is boring
HL 2 was good.
say what again?
Dashite: Oh you.
4You need to whet your whistle
Boooring!
The Singleplayer is great
I'll miss story-driven FPSs.
Troll detected: Firing Orbital Friendship cannon!
Everything AAA is going MP.
the Deathmatch is dead though
4Seriously, get some water or something down your throat
Valve games are the worst games ever. They just rush shit out every couple of months without any quality control.
Played it once. Tried to play it again, and I can't do it.
trolololololo
RobotPinkie, I know man!
RobotPinkie: And EA and Activision don't?
RobotPinkie,i see your trolling.Time to chain you to the wall!
Nittany, RP is trolling.
>sarcasm detector is broken...
/me chains RobotPinkie to the wall
well to be fair
recent Valve is like that
Oh.
old Valve wasn't
Bobby Kotick is the one voice of reason in the entire gaming world!
but recent Valve definitely yes
Yeah I'm kidding.
I dunno.
I'd hate Valve to turn bad like the rest of the large publishers.
I wub Valve
4Damn, that must have been one harsh cold
>implying they haven't already
I don't consider any of them to be good except Valve.
Valthejean, you are not seeing the sarcasm in RobotPinkie's statement. I hope you see it with the Bobby Kotick Statement
RobotPinkie, Valve has been trolling the entire gaming world for the past 4 years now.
I wonder what the hell RobotPinkemena is about.
dear god, i'm listening to some random speach on birth order and psychological implications
4Question, Dari
RobotPinkie you are pushing the realms of believability.
WHY CAN'T I FIND IT AND TURN IT OFF
4What are you playing?
Dermathil: that's irrelevant, I was just being fair because that is the case. Troll or not
I'm wary of Valve
What's that, you guys want some Episode 3 news? Well we have a big announcement coming up!
and it's horrifying
4It looks pretty damn fleshed out
I know, Sumica, or well I hoped I pushed WAY past it with that last statement about Kotick :P
I've seen Blink, and this game gives me worse nightmares
oh ValtheJean, it's an amazing game.
4Who doesn't like it?
me
*Team Fortress 2 adds hats!*
Val hates 75% of everything.
4Oh
It's a shit game
4ValtheJean
it's based on NES design, with modern game designs
and it's an insult to classic RPGs
He is very specific on his tastes.
4But there's so much shit to equip
lol
Not everything Valve does is like... automatically golden
ValtheJean, seriously, cool it. play it first, then dis it
4It's like a plethora of goodies
Valthejean, it is a parody of classic RPGs, not an insult.
but they're DAMN good
It's getting really windy outside.
Hell yeah, it is you fucking British tea bagger :P
honestly, Baldur's Gate is the game for lonely D&D players who can't get a party
No
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAAAH
oh, oh! Oho! Silvermane, you amz good troll :P
Valthejean keeps sounding like a PC extremist elitists.
4I think he hates your tea, bro
not the tea!
lol Dermathil, I AM a PC extremist elitist
Eh, there are very few games I actually hate.
I'm not even hiding it
Seriously, he comeso ut as antagonistic.
4Of course it is
This game right now, Mardek or whatever?
4You're British :P
besides, I've been watching Dari play this game
and I have yet to see anything I enjoy
It looks like a lot of fun, except I'm annoyed with the long monologues...
/me finds a leash made of adamantium and leashes dari with it.
MWAHAHAHAHA
I'm annoyed with the lack of any form of english mastery...
RobotPinkie, you can press Z to skip dialogue
I hope you do understand that it is a parody, though.
oh I do
I AM DEH UBAHMENSH.
Oh, thanks SilverMane, might actually play this soon, then :P
but just because you're making a parody doesn't excuse being completely inept at it
Just cause ValtheJean has good taste in games unlike the rest of you. :p
Dashite: Oh you :P
4Dari, you should stream play Cthulhu Saves the World. Awesome 2D RPG game that came out this year
I love the JRPG style, still
he did an amazing job at it. it's one of the most highly lauded RPG on dozens of sites
Well, except for that Half Life thing. :p
haha
he did
4It's really good
4Only $3?
4Hell yeah, great deal
Getting really, really windy outside.
ok, i'm freaking out
Dashite,u so troll.
there is some random people talking in my headphones
Valthejean, what is your opinion on MINECRAFT
and i can't find them
WHY WON'T THEY SHUT UP
Though I prefer Morrowind to most JRPGs TBH :P
4Morrowind
4Fuck yes
Silvermane, check your adverts
Why does everyone assume I'm a troll when I tell them I don't like Half Life. :(
Dermathil: Very clever concept, really good waste of time game.
You not in Skype SilverMane? XD
this computer doesn't have skype
and Baldur's Gate 2... first one is a bit too clumsy
4And Minecraft is an excellent title
that's not your headphones it's the voices in your head.
Icewind Dale, now that was a great RPG
Valthejean, every game can be seen as a waste of time. Because it is not time spent on being productive for the society.
because the game likes to troll you dari :P
And the power flickered.
lol and I play Minecraft a lot, too
Dermathil, didn't mean it as an insult
Dashite,you have the right to not like a game.Just don't assume that everypony doesn't like it aswell.
I'm a redstone addict
/me wonders if a tornado will go by.
I just meant to say it's a really good game if you just want to blow away a few hours
4What game does Dashite not like?
Me neither, Valthejean. I am just stating a truth of this universe.
4Oh
:P
Pegacorn, I don't think it's possible to assume everyone doesn't like Half Life.
4Half Life
4I liked Half Life 2
HALF LIFE
HALF LIFE
Haven't played the first one.
LEFT 4 DEAD
TEAM FORTRESS 2
>says the fan of GunZ
4Left 4 Dead is pretty decent
Wait, you don't like half-life due to bunny-hopping?
4I can't run TF2
Half Life 2 was great, I have some problems with Episode 2 though...
What game is Dari talking about now?
it's the same god damn thing
GunZ
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING
L4D and TF2 are awesome in my opinion.
so?
how the fuck does that matter?
i didn't care for L4D, but that's because i have an expectation from zombie games that it went a different route with
it's still a bunch of retards flying around a room
?
4Speaking of zombies
at least bunny hopping took skill...
I like S4 more then Gunz
Flying while shooting, SO WHO'S LOOK FORWARD TO TRIBES: ASCEND?!
I dun geddit SilverMane.
Valthejean, you mean a street or a boat in GunZ?
dun ged wha, pegacorn
4It certainly seems like CoD is really ramping up the whole zombie love with their latest map pack for Black Ops
Dermathil, I just meant room as in graphed area
Dun ged ur expectations.
4Yep, more map packs for Black Ops
Ah yes I heard they had a new one coming Dashite
I know, val.
4Rezzurection
4Yes, that's how they spelled it
SO, Who's looking forward to the release of Space Marine?
4Some game
Sumica, yup.
Warhammer 40K title
lol
3rd person shooter
Sadly, ultramarine hero
PLANETSIDE 2!
AN HERO
4There were no spoils that day
Wonder if EVE will ever get there shooter tie in game done.
nah, let him die
Les Miz.That's why.
I gave them a chance....one
mmm eye juice
4Eye juice
now I want them dead :P
4The fuck
just wait til you get some Chocolate Milk
And i have never seen Les Miz.I SUCK.
wait, what did Dari say about Space Marine? I was off computer for the last 3 minutes
4It's a game
isn't Space Marine about Warhammer or something?
Yes
7Sumica PM
Warhammer 40K title set up as a TPS game.
Space Marine. Free to play, but you have to pay us first.
Waith
*Wait
kay, OOOOOHHHHH
That's Dust 541.
Nittany_Tiger_, like Guild Wars?
lawl, Nittany.
lol wow, I like that the Phage is actually modelled after a bacteriophage
and almost all other games?
LA RESISTANCE LIVES ON.
Dammit CCP, Y U NO PC VERSION DUST 514?!
I thought Guild Wars was free except for the game itself.
4Guild Wars is free
4Well
4Free to play
Ohai hacksaw.You die now.
Game is really cheap now, too
4Free to play, dari
it means you don't pay monthly
/me blows the hacksaw up.
It means you don't pay monthly.
Dammit Val!

I know that.

4It means you don't pay monthly

Killer and take there stuff.
just wait for the priestess to talk
07What does CDC = ?
"My first magic item! Awesome! What the?! Why am I a girl?!"
Dari's speaking in like...half-french half-jamaican accents...
oki
Do you have any questions before we start?
anyone know spanish? Llantos,sollozos y mas sollozos...
PIRATE ACCENT
cant read that rofl
I remember using a hack on iRO to sex change. It was hilarious playing as a different sex every day, people would go nuts
Dashite, you read Order of the Stick?
Yeah
You sound like Samwise Gamgee...
/me raises his hand
Noting off the top of my head, no

I liked the part where they get that belt and are like: "Wait...if the ogre we got this from was wearing that..."
Say "Mr Frodo" in that voice.
and then the ogre changes into a woman

10Yeah, it's from Worlds 2011 (TCG tournament)
02@Insane:
second
even still Silvermane, my original point still stands :P
02Cries, sobs and more sobs
true, but Crystals being the major point in a game originated in FF1
Your crystal is in another castle.
how did you hear about us?
10There's a T-Shirt and hat too
10http://pokebeach.com/2011/08/worlds-2011s-swag-next-years-location

10Parents would never let me travel for something like that, which is also why I couldn't attend the BW mall tour
0Bernard is the best of those 4, but you won't know why for a great while
Don't worry, we'll reach the ground in approximately 10 minutes.
As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
brb later. Yoshi wants me to take her out for a walk.
Intill then,what should we do?
erm forgot u guys doint know yoshi... Yoshi = my iguana. sorry.
Sprinks
Honistly not a clue. Dont realy know what others can bring but what I have seen I would be the only one in PST
I dunno...
Are you watching the interview?
kill off the useless one
0Mardek, why you so weak? i remember him being OP
I didn't think it through that far.
I do seem to have a knack for finding uttlery random videos.
...clearly.
07brb, I'm gonna eat some pie and shower
inb4 Obvious conclusion.
bitch I'll kill Emela if I damn well want to :P
Hence: <SirSprinkles>: >EVE
that makes me so god damn happy
0then again, i got used to level 40 Mardek with best wapons and armor in the game and elemental attacks. yay 5k base damage
10Anyway, going out for a while
0Yes
/me prays to his god Loki and gets teleported to Valhalla.
force them to drink i
it*
lol
WUT!
OH HELL NAH!

and then the glass breaks on her eyes
And so far my opinion is basically just... "Well, it could be TacoWiz..."
"OH GOD MY EYES....MY EYES!"

Why don't people know how to sell themselves...

/me appears right in front of RobotPinkie and breaks a bottle of Bailey's over his head

/me gives her a california hand roll on her way out
Not a clue.
inb4 you find out silver was trolling you and you WERE supposed to kill him last
moving on?
/me laps up what he can of the Bailey's
0kill Aalia asap
later sky
dat lag
I suppose.
0don't bother with Power Attack, it's rarely worthwhile
U drunk now RobotPinkie?
a sword to the face will tend to do that
I'm a robot, I get drunk if I don't have alcohol.
?
0lol, you aren't Bender
Futurama reference ftw
lol
:P
/me drinks sake out of his big ass cup

12Back
0Kill her now!
So is that it?
I'm actually having Pepsi right now...
What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
0no kill Bartholio prick
So,by saying that RobotPinkie,you prove that you are drunk.
0now*
where is you shield now huh?
I see no USP
I guess so, Pegacorn
0he has M Shield
But the thing is
he has the hub
let him die LET HIM DIIIIIIE
that's a HUGE USP
but M Shield is not against physical attacks, right?
inb4 Obvious event.
0ValtheJean, you're CN, aren't you
or am I making too many JRPG assumptions here...
Chaotic Neutral? Oh in that DnD thing we've been doing. Yeah
0i mean you in general
oh yes and USP is Unique Selling Point ;)
well I can't go about telling you stuff like that, it ruins the fun :P
0Robot Pinkie, M. Shield halves all spells (heaing and damage)
wb Vaporeon
12Thanks
Short of scheduling more events or atleast posting the events in a more timely mannor not much. So far as i knew there were issues fiting in all the fans in channle as it is.
0Shield halves all melee
/me gives Vaporeon to Insane_Lugia
Yeah, a lot like FF then
0indeed
except there it's barrier and whatever
0right
/me takes sushi back :<
Shell and Protect, or Barrier and Shell if it's older ones
0Shell and Protect
but yeah :P
I'm liking this game more and more

RAWR!
That purple 5'o clock shadow. IT'S TAUNTING ME
0lol mardek
0why you no strong yet
nooooooo not you too RobotPinkie!
I used to respect you!
Any other ideas?
?
lololol
oh hey, the sound died
nm
as long as I can skip the story, I'm fine with this game
for them of you that wana see. i just took a picture of Yoshi to share her with you guys :) <script src='http://img842.imageshack.us/shareable/?i=unledlg.png&p=tl' type='text/javascript'></script><noscript>[URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/842/unledlg.png/][IMG]http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/5073/unledlg.png[/IMG][/URL]</noscript>

or well, I don't mind dari reading the story, that's funny :P
if you listen closely, you can hear it in the background
k cya later takeing her for a walk
heh np
0ah
0RobotPinkie, you CAN skip the story, but as it develops, it becomes very involved
o.o oh wow I was expecting a yoshi plush or something xD
nice lizard!
oh, I can't wait :-/
0considering chapter 3 is at least a 25 hour game, stretching to over 60 if you go for full complete
well, that's not exactly appealing to me, SilverMane :P
What game?
0Barrier Break, he has Barrier on
I think my ability to sense how drunk somepony is comes from my former drinking when a horrible event happens to me.
0shield, even
I mean having lots of content is fine, but having that much story is... I dunno.
I'd rather watch LotR
0it's a full length RPG, Robot Pinkie
well you wouldn't be able to hit hard too if you had a giant anal dwelling spirit in you!
0but this is chapter 2
02THIS GAME
02HATES ME
02TO DEATH
Not really. You seem to have a good thing going here so far. YOu have a good following but it takes a good portion of the day for a movie night and such. Spreading it to othere nights might be a good idea but might just spread the viewership out too much.
0ValtheJean, lol spoilers bro
/me cries
spoilers? that happened in like the first 10 seconds of the game!
What game?
>read dwelling as drilling
0nice Vehrn. Nice
So,RobotPinkie.....what are you seeing in front of you?
0The game we are watching, Nittany_Tiger_
0Mardek RPG
Oh.
02Y MoF HAETS MEH SO MUCH
Oh, that one.
A hoof, pegacorn?
0and now for epic battle over dialogue
/me is not impressed so far
wait wait wait...you didn't kill them?
Maybe RobotPinkie.
wat?
0i love Aalia
"My me hurts"?
DAMN YOU DARI AND YOUR PACIFISM!
Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
I just remembered... I never played through both the NWN expansions
due to game ending bug in the first one
pleas tell me at some point you get to kill them.
Now what do you see?
0i played NWN, but my file kept getting corrupted
/me is close to RobotPinkie.
OH GOD PUT THAT THING AWAY, PEGACORN!
0Sumica, you fight them several times, but they are key characters later
Indeed Durgarr, the same way you can think you're a parody when you're just poorly written
0even stop being pricks at one point, too
/me runs for the hills
WOAH!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?

I have NWN patched now, though, so it should be fine.
Wut SilverMane?
0wut Pegacorn?
02Nah, I'm used to the bullet hell thing
02BUT IN THIS TOUHOU
I keep trying to play NWN, but it aalways seems to crash on me unfortunately. Same with the second one too
Not all that sure my self. Guess somthing just clicked seemed like a enjoyable place to be and see/ help flourish. Even if I dont have any solid ideas as to how we can do it yet.
for what, SilverMane ?
02DEATHBOMBING IS IMPOSSIBRUUUU
This:<SilverMane>: Also more sex. Ohyes
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
halp
0that's part of the description for Chocolate Milk
