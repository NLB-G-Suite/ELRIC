02I dunno
In a smaller scale but still
yfw when derpy isnt in the hospital
02Depends on the games lol
Then someone shat all over that brilliance which was given to us.
10Dari it was great
XD
(we can only hope...for crossovers I mean)
02(That's why I'm not buying the 3ds)
DAT SKYPE

02:P

4Ummmmmmmmm, I don't care about the references in the song. The song itself is crap.

10Ghosties be Ghostin!
mad
the 3DS has games :3
all pinkie songs are good
4Nope
(EVEN HER SCHNEEZES ARE GRRACEFUL)
4But, it wasn't a Pinkie song
I don't like Katy Perry either, that's not the point.
4It was Katy Perry
TUMMY TUMMY TUMMY
02It has games yeah
Dat pose.
02But does it haves GOOD games?
7dat rant
:O
lawl
yes
4But I just don't like the song
My LIttle Pony: Making Katy Perry bearable
02OoT is a remake, doesn't count\
10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT7UWCJo6GE
4It's all personal preference, mind you
02remakes don't count for me :\
10Best song?
>implying anything can make Katy Perry bearable
The point is they acknowledged us, and dedicated something specifically to us. How many fandoms get that. :/
Not many.
10^
^
^
...
ports don't count for me

10lol. Dem arrows
10WIN

10SilverMane go die
Don't worry dari I didn't like it either
Fluttershy is adorable even when she's evil
Pinkie's epic laugh
I HAVE AWWIVED
10SilverMane I said go die <3 But I didn't mean it
Photo Finish is second-best pony after Trixie
DA MAJICKS
I have half a mind to take this belt off right now. to show you ALL of my <3
They did deface it.
>mar, disfigure
They changed it beyond recognition
4Again, how can you deface something when it's already shit :/
Fluttershy giving the Facestealer Koh the Stare.
Dari, y'all being kinda melodramatic there.
They gave something to a fandom known for doing such things.
THE GRRRRRRRRREAT AND POWERRRRFULL TRRRRRRRRRRIXIE!!
7heh
7yes
yep
naked trixie
4What I'm implying is that Equestria Girls, to me, is shit. Defacing is implying that you made it bad, and I'm saying how can you make it bad when it's already bad
post-show

I liked it too, shame it was canceled
... there you go, I just proved my point LOL
6Nyeh?
It's not just the cartoons that were aimed at us, even the older classics were amazing compared to most of today's cartoons.
6More than half do. ovo
Instead of all over the place and random like the old cartoons were.
04that's few to me
I like random comedy.
No, I don't disagree.

I keep hearing that DNF was painfully disappointing. =/
yup
Yes, DNF sucked.
It was
a painful, trainwreck of doom.
I couldn't stand the first level.
The demo was nice.
It would have rocked like TEN YEARS ago.
I like how ZP covered DNF

I was just thinking that the piano piece that was playing earlier reminds me of the music from "Hotel Dusk"

9so basically PONY TYPES: THE MASS PRODUCTION MECHS
04when I'm thinking about my stories at night I can always think of the right words to say
Wayneright
04But when I actually get to writing them they always slip away...
I like this plan
04...holy crap that rhymes
.
I NEVER PUT THAT TOGETHER!
I would swear that one of the ghosts that walked past him earlier was Harvy Bullock

it'd hurt like shit

04Perfect
YES
YES YES YES YES YES
man it's fast
best case..
Head Lasers.
Barrages of Missiles.
i think
correct
Bandaging the bone tightly would help a lot
9you're missing the Inside-Arms gatlings
Those too.
9and the hook/anchor chain thing
0its needs to be about 20% cooler...
04hmm
No side
04In this case the character is trying to carry an unconscious person home on his back
/me changes it to a large gash on his leg
Just have him drag his leg.
1 leg out of 4 = no problem
tbh
if it was a front leg then yes
but.
Enough Mecha worship. Now for the DEMOLITION!!!
A large gash on the back to side of the leg actually, femoral artery.
k?
9gotta adjust quality
Do want
Bring...back...my...ghost...
there is somthing you want to not hear over the phone
bcuz bleed out and die
04hmm
9back live
I THINK.
If the femoral artery is wounded, you bleed out in minutes.
04So a fracture on the back hind leg would be fine, although I assume he'd be left with a limp?
Y7?
Essentially, yes.
wtf...
Oh, this show
this show never made much sense to me
then again, I never liked mechas
9the only show 4chan unanimously loves

I was on DinkyPage

Hiya.
I'd probably appreciate you more if you didn't remind me of how horribly I did in my music classes. :/
Awww, I'm sorry. Keep practicing! Maybe you can still get the hang of it.
I haven't played an instrument in 9 years now.
Ouch.
Playing is such fun. And can be nice and relaxing too.
Ahh.
Heh
I sorta played the flute for 3 years in elementary school because it was the smallest instrument and therefore the easiest to carry home for practice.
I've always just been really musical. I cant remember a time I wasnt drumming on anything I could find.
And of course then I never bother to sign it out.
Ahh, the flute. Nice. I've played the flute a tiny bit, but not enough to be good at it.
I actually didnt evne play instruments much in school. I mostly played outside of school.
Well, I'm out for tonight. Have a goodnight everypony.

Client?
03LOL.
03Pattyrick, I bought a tablet for $150
IRC999
03HP TouchPad
03they were recently discontinued
How do you like it?
03so they went on a massive sale
03I don't know yet.
03It hasn't been shipped
Oh
/me finishes off his last coke for "today"
03well yeah, I figured for that price it would be worth it
6Hey.
I recently got a tablet, I'm on it now
how often do you sleep?
03if you say iPad
Acer Iconia a100
03I'm going to murder ou
03*you
03oh
03OK
03XD
I'll high five you
Once a day
>_>
I considered an ipad at one point but this was $200 cheaper I think
It's more for convenience, portability, and leisure than it is a full-on computer
I'm just asking based on something I heard awhile back
Do you know any stats?
03that's why you get a netbook.
?
Specs?
Yeah
and that he sleeps for about 3 hours, once a week.
6And even then it's only for 4-6 hours.
wow.
7" screen, 1.0 ghz nVidia Tegra CPU,,
How do you do it?
uh.
6Insomnia.
oh.
Also mycursor isn'toving right like it should
6Though I have that too.
yeah.
I understand.
I also can't see most of my text.
and lol.
I can pull off that first kind, but I don't think I could do it for any extended period of time.
Can you function on that little sleep?
Does it run Android?
6When I go to try to sleep, it takes me at the very least two hours.
6And I've gotten used to it..
1GB ram, 8 gb rom with micro SD card slot
yes
Ok
6Your brain needs 2 hours of a certain level of sleep per day to function properly.
6I get it all at once when I sleep.
6Like, I go immediately into it.
My first Android device.
hmm, that's interesting.
6So when I first wake up, I'm a lot more attentive than some people are most of their day.
The thing is, I really mostly wanted to try the Android platform more than anything
6Pretty much.
03yes I did
which is why I got this tablet
6It's the type of sleep you get right before you start dreaming.
03<Pattyrick> It's more for convenience, portability, and leisure than it is a full-on computer
03> that's why you get a netbook.
6You're body's used to getting that type of sleep at that time of day.
I'm interested as well, but Android devices aren't quite as readily available as in the US
12Back
I'd much prefer something like an iPod touch but there aren,'t really any android devices like it.
Wb GL
03EW IPOD TOUCH
12Thanks :3
*6
I mean that aren't contract phones.
12drf
03what
6*shrug*
12Just look at a iPad and say that to it
I liked my iPod touch to be honest.
12It's not going to care. At all
/me is going to try that
I like my iPod touch, but iPhone (while a lot more expensive) has some great improvements
6I highly recommend you don't.
6Ever.
awww..... -_-
3G capability is probably the biggest advantage
6That's why.
But I can't get a contract phone.
12lol
You don't seem nuts to me? atleast not online.
In fact you seem like one of the more sane people here.
no they don't
mine doesn't
6That's mostly because I have outlets for the crazy.
You should come over here and get an iPhone without one :P
03some even have 4G :P
it's a tracfone
also 4G isn't 4G
4G isn't developed yet
03yes, but it's faster 3G :P
6I've learned to control it, since I've been doing it for YEARS.
03no./
It's available, but not widespread enough for everyone to be able to use it
6Yeah, I can't sleep well at all.
03and it is fast
6Like, this is my ...fourth? all-nighter this week.
03>wi-fi
Mine "firs" under "smart" phone
6But I function just fine as far as work goes.
fits*
12What OS does it have?
my phone can't get Wi-Fi
Apple works with developed technologies (although here in Italy even 3G is unreliable xD)
6As long as you're getting something...
03Apple is a pile of crap
Java.
12Give it up drf :p
03why don't you
Please
D:
6I get no sleep, I chain smoke, I used to drink... a lot.
Yeah drf, let's just agree to disagree and talk about something less arguable :P
uh, a few months.
I've never smoked before. Don't really plan to.
12Ah
it's a prepaid phone
LG something.
12lol patty XD
tracfone.
Never heard of them
03I have
03they're crap
12I have, they're pretty good
03Zoroark
03you should look into VIrgin Mobil,e Prepaid
Not my decision.
03I helped my friend out there, you can buy an Android smartphone for $200 and get unlimited talk/text/internet for $25 a month.
Parents etc.
Hold on restarting client.
I personally prefer simple, prepaid phones to smartphones
12lol
03eh
12Ever heard of prepaid smartphones?
03Smartphones are actually really useful
03prepaid is dumb
03I mean
6Also, never stay up more than 60 hours at a time, and I really don't even recommend even 48 to be honest.
Brb
like running out of battery quicker!
12k
03:)
6I am NEVER staying up the 106 hours again.
Ouch
I was going to try that next weekend.
6I hold the ponychan record, last I checked.
106 hours??
I think the most I've done is around 40 hours.
6The hallucinations. THE HALLUCINATIONS.
12Well, Virgin Mobile gives you all the free 3g data you want
Fault that be ;)
Or wait, nvm
That was bad enough. I can't imagine staying up more than twice that.
6My brain was fried.
6It was BAD.
I do like this tablet though.
6The hallucinations were just... horrible.
12Welcome back Zoroark :3
Seems nice.
Thanks.
6Especially considering I walk everywhere.
12Anything acer is nice
I like usefulness of smartphones, but I want a phone as a phone
uh
6You start getting hallucinations as soon as 40 hours, though for some people it takes a bit longer. Mine kicked in at 50, and got worse, and worse.
huh.
12I want a computer that can act as a phone :)
Wb Zoroark
03you can do that.]
12I know
6I was talking to an imaginary spider for the last 7 hours.
03ever heard of those mini PCI express cards that you can put in laptops that give you 3G anywhere?
my client is reconnecting
while I'm connected
AndroIRC.
6I'm still not the same as I was. I'm a bit more, jumpy.
Hmmm
you walk everywhere as in you don't drive?
"OMG, please don't eat me!"
I just kind of picked something and went with it
That would be cool drf, but
6And work isn't that far away.
6It's like, an hour walk.
It hasn't messed up like this before...
-t
6Which, for the area, is nothing.
Perhaps one of the main reasons I prefer tablets to netbooks/laptops is the trackpad and keyboard
03tablets don't actually have keyboards.
03and I hate trackpads
03give me a real mouse any day fo the week
03*of
I think an hour walk in any direction except north east would take me outside of town.
03that's why you use an ACTUAL MOUSE
03I know, groundbreaking, right?
and tiny keyboards on netbooks
6brb have to restart comp
ok
Flat, stable surface
03nope
03not if you have a laser mouse
greenist.
Not always accessible while on the go
03*of
XD
03nope
It's much easier to just tap
Or swipe
03I actually use the surface of my laptop for a mouse LOL
vhcgfgfdstyuhghui
09,08EYERAPE
berb again
Been accused of a crime, and I'm not sure if I actually did it or not.... but i'ma go with not, cause that's easier
o_O
Or great for that matter
But it's convenient
Easy
03well
03what you should get, then
apart from trackballs which I can't use because my hand shivers,
03is one of those hybrid netbooks/tablets, where the screen flips around and can be used as a full touch screen
trackbuttons are the most annoying thing.
That would be convenient
03they do make them
03my friend has one
Cept it's not on neopets
these iny quarter-inch thingies on some laptops
?
03it's called a Lenovo Ideapad I think
Any recommendations?
Ok
I've basically been using this tablet for all the things I used to use my iPod touch for
To me it just feels like a bulkier version of a phone, minus the phone
You've owned an iPod touch, right drf?
get it right (tm)
03I've used one, I would never buy one
1st and 4th
Ok
ew
03I'm not cool with the whole "only one button" thing
03you know how inconvenient that is?
03I mean, sure, virtual buttons are fine, but when the app FREEZES, you're kinda up the creek without a paddle
There are 4 buttons, drf
03no.
not particularly
03volume doesn't count
top button
03you mean power?
Yes it does, it's a physical button
power/sleep
03yeah, but if it freezes, those buttons don't do anything
03and I mean, at least with my phone, I can take the battery out if it freezes that badly.
hold down both, obtain reset
Same with any device
03no.
03iPods don't have removable batteries
If any device freezes
03not unless you happen to carry around a set of screwdrivers with you
HOLD THE POWER BUTTON
03that doesn't always work
03I knew someone with an iPhone, that thing froze, and we tried holding down power for like 20 minutes
03nothing happened
03nope.
03not if they BREAK
oh?
03we literally had to sit there and wait for the battery to die.
lol
03yes, because they totally need to be updated every 6 hours..
Ol drf
03if it freezes, the backlight stays on = no power saving
Did you know how to properly reset it?
03yep
03I googled it
03it didn't work
i don't update anything. unless i have a reason.
You hold down both power and home button
03the only 100% guaranteed way is to pull the battery out
03and since the iPod battery is soldered in, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
>implying updating every 6 hours isn't a law of technology
03LOL
can't type fast
03I tried everythign
03all like four methods
longest restart ever.
03the button combinations aren't actually hardwired in
12Anyways, what's up Zoroark? :3
03so if the OS freezes, it doesn't even know you're pressing the buttons
12..
12XD
Not much.
03You basically have to take the battery out or cut the power off somehow
Can you remove Android device batteries?
03Yes.
12Yep
03At least on all the phones I've seen, I don't know about tablets
Tablets, too?
Not all, but most.
03but this is why I do my research before buying things.
I can't remove mine.
also
03all of the Motorola Droids have batteries that can be removed
this tablet has a total of 3 physical buttons
and a switch
03mine has an entire keyboard. LOL
I do like the Droid, but I'm not in an area of the world that offers them
03you should be able to buy Motorola phones in any European country
03they're just called different names
03Motorola Milestone is the European Droid
Physical keyboard is good, but smal
I haven't seen it at my Vodafone store
..... yawn.
03well
Yeah
03not being able to buy it at an actual store != it's not available
03you could probably order it from their website
sleepy?
Wimp!
Perhaps I just need to look more carefully
03wtf
03Vodafone doesn't sell phones online? Lame.
03hm
03the UK one does
03and can't you buy from any EU country without any import taxes?
02Thx :3
I haven't looked online
right now, this:
03http://www.vodafone.co.uk/brands/android/android-range/index.htm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpUKVfU3A2E
03they have lots of them :P
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Edge of The World by Faith No More" -
What's most annoying about this tablet is that the home "button" isn't a button.
soooo comfortable......
12It's a hot key? I think that's pretty awesome tbh
That's one thing about some Android tablets
uh?
03well, on my Droid, the buttons are attached to the screen, but they respond on their own
03like even if the app freezes, it seems to work XD
it's a capacitive "button"
03yeah
03and the slide-out keyboard has a search button and a menu button
03no home, thoughl.
03-l
03oh, it also has the back button
Listening to this right now http://theophany-rmx.bandcamp.com/album/crystal-flash-ep
12[02:22] <Zoroark> it's a capacitive "button" <-- Pretty much the same thing
Which annoys me because I expect some kind of tactile response, like my phone or the iPhone.
03as my phone does that.
03it's an option that you can turn on and off.
sleepy time for Polarfire. night bros
As in I can feel where it is
03oh
night Polarfire
03well it lights up
Bbl, breakfast
03you should know where it is
03LOL
03my phone isn't either
It lights up after I find it lopl
12You'll get used to it XD
03mine lights up as long as the backlight is on
I have literally searched for it
mine doesn't
03and the nice thing about having a keyboard
/me RUNS
03No.
02bbl
02=w=
03but I HAVE seen ANdroid phones with the four physical buttons
12Yeah, I have too
03the nice thing about Android is that basically every Android device ever has the four buttons
03opposed to just one that iPhone has
03because yes, power and volume are separate
03I have seen some without back buttons, but they always have home/menu/search

12Too bad lol
03I was thinking like the HTC Thunderbolt or something

When you do something every waking moment at the expense of everything else, though, I'd call that addiction.
/me takes the soldier mask off
maybe, RP. But addiction means modifications in the way the brain is wired together.
That's a semantic argument which ignores every definition but one.
There's still one thing i don't understand.
12!Espeon
/me now belongs to Vaporeon for 19 minutes
(and RP, I understand. But watch the entire vid. I personally may have that "gaming addiction" myself and I think it shed a different light on the subject)
....Don't ask.
He is occupied the rest of the time
and only comes for the movies?
Oh.

Okay, watching the entire thing.
Hi.
BOW CHICKA WOW WOW

CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES.
PS3
I like having a physical copy.
Problem is, DRM.
inb4 me making a random pop culture reference
Myeah, I prefer having a physical copy, too.
Me too
or well, I prefer both, I guess, if I get it for the same price...
Wish more games did that.
I really don't like gaming today (PC gaming more) as publishers are putting more restrictions on it and taking control of games away from end users.
Ex: Ubisoft games.
There are some others.
Ubisoft is stupid. Money does that to you.
I don't buy their games at all.
I refuse to support a company that supports such a ridiculous measure
In fact, I think a few do.
or "Other OS"
Yeah.
Hi, all
I didn't update my PS3 for months until it was stolen.
Also sucks with no backwards compatibility.
Granted, OtherOS wasn't great, but it was there, and it was unfair to strip it away as a lazy tactic to deal with an undisclosed "security concern."
Older PS3s have BC.
Mine does.
Well, not here.
Newer ones don't.
It was stripped for cost.
hello everybody :)
Hmm.
hey insano
06ohai Insane_Lugia
And not that it matters yet again, because I really don't want shitty slowed down PAL versions of games :P
I'll just have to buy an American PS2
He needs to ditch his because the only output that works is HDMI and he doesn't have an HD set
You can fix that.
Has he tried resetting his console to factory default?
I really don't want to do a solder reflow.
It's actually just holding a button down.
No, I meant on mine.
I know how to do a factory reset.
Oh ok.
I did it on mine a couple times before I got my HD set
haiii there :)
havent seen him for a week
10:3
10Insane, Manlyguy left TST
did he delete his account?
10Yes
manlyguy left really?
10I asked him why
manlyguy left, fluttershy left, whos next.
06o.o
10Whoops, pasted that backwards, but oh well
10It was on another shoutbox
Hi AiZ
06Perhaps he prefers forums? .P
WUT Allis?
what's wrong Allis?
Yeah, what's wrong?
For about 6 weeks before and 1-2 after my birthday everything just about sucks
hmm
Know the feeling
10Dunno
Yep.
However, for me it's been two years
Oh, yeah!
And worry about what'll be of the future? Yeah, it's that time
definitely
Myeah.
That's like a lot more than one time per year.

Just came out of a period like that, it sucks, man.
Oh, naw, it happens more often, trust me
hmm

TO MA TOES
Glad you found ponies, too, at least
Well welcome back.

All that extra money I made on this job, I'd really would give it all back right now.
Crappy job?
The job was ok.
10lolhisbirthdayistoday
It was the surprises of the third week.
Constant overtime, then weekend work.

go view his profile
I collapsed under the stress.
10Huh?
Oh wow, that just blows
Now you shall simply be known as "Sir"
Really fucked up in that department.
oh manlyguy's? >.<
06Well kinda hard when he deleted his profile
10His profile should be gone if he deleted his account
10yeah
It was a simple job, but I didn't like being told that I had to work more and more.
Are they at least paying overtime?
Ergh, I hate when the plan changes drastically at work.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, that totally blows
$14.25/hour overtime
But I hated all the work.
I should have quit earlier.
ARGH
Can't say I know the feeling; I'm on my first job right now and have yet to come across a situation like that
I'M A KARMA CHARGER
I hope you never do.
?
But if you can afford to quit, and have other job prospects, then it might be a good idea to look for something else?
You shall now be known simply as "Pega"
OHMAHGAWD.
/me is watching the Intel Extreme masters League of Legends finals
I don't need a job anymore. I'm still in school and get paid for TA duties, but that runs out this Fall.
I'm just hungry, that's all.

ROBOTPINKEMENA IS BACK!
i dont have a a account. i never made 1 because inever had any friends on it nor had a reason to make one =\
But sometimes you have no way out. This is how I felt that overtime week.
I did have a way out, though.
Just didn't take it.
I didn't need the money anymore like I did before.
But I didn't quit out of pride.
If you have some pride in you and don't want to let people down (including yourself which is usually added unknowingly), then it becomes hard to make that decision
Exactly.
I went through that when my internship turned into a full-time job, except for about 40% less than the average for someone in my position

Hmmm...
Instead of the pride of not wanting to be a quitter.
I see. Can't say I hated college either, but I wanted to get some work experience after I graduated
23 and no work experience just felt laughable to me, even if I thought I'd NEVER blend well in a social activity like... working
Meh,ok.

lol its weird i refuse to subscribe to people.
The plot thickens.
why?
FFF-
I didn't know Alt F+4 would close the java window. Great.
GASP
not sure, i think because ihad bad xp of subscribeing to people like not knowing how to unsubscribe. then my inbox got flooded by videos i did not really want to watch.
/me licks hacksaw to confirm
...oh, this isn't jam...
You don't want to know.
yeah I do get annoyed when my inbox on DA is flooded with too many pics
I have done it once.
It rhymes with "flood," is all I can say...
It's pony time, of course
i enjoy looking at them... but, i dont care to see repets which is why i did it.
In fact, it's 80% written in my head.
Not me, I only have a PS3.

Unlike weather stories, I don't think Saw stories have been done.
You mean fanfic?
Yeah.
The later ones were more gorefests.
The earlier ones were more psychological.
I enjoyed them all, but I consider #4 the peak of the series.
And #5 the lowpoint.
10Me
I don't like the pose too much though
10How did it go?
I lost.
Kinda think Saw 6 was the low point, though, but I haven't seen Saw 3D...
Hi everyone
It doesn't put a good end to the series.
10The song
But you think I should watch it?

I like physics, quite a bit
I'm studying meteorology, too.
I just never had a knack for it in school
I'm not going to buzzkill the show physics.
In fact, it would be fun to back it up.

oh my gosh by usher is prob one of my faves due to how he sings with the beat.
although the dungeons did feel like a crawler from P&P times

also, did you guys see that Trixie comic on EQD?
10The Offspring?

No.

10Yep
Unless I forgot I saw it.
at 1:20 is where i take intrest inthe song.

10Odd typo
it would be... such an awesome episode
The Fall of Trixie
ORLY SilverMane?
Just saw it.
how do you like porn star danceing?
I would go nuts if Luna fell again.
10Where have I heard that before, is it a band or song?
If she wasn't "killed" in Ep 2.

I believe Faust did say it was possession

Yeah, I think she did, Val
oh really? must have missed that one.
It was in a DA comment
it's a really obscure one
I've only seen it once or twice
well
she is confirmed for season 2 (luna that is)
I wouldn't mind them getting some influences from G1 in that sense.
lol
She's a fanfic character
and she's been taking over ponychan
like seriously
which is why she'll never show up

just halla at me
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
7bewareeeee
I like her as a background pony that is like a "Where's Waldo" thing
she even has a speaking role
if they made her more than just appearances, they run the risk of upsetting the fandom for "portraying her wrong"

10Maybe not

and i'll be back; going to go get food
dat SilverMane
if it were anything else (which it most likely would be) then no
inb4 Silvermane episode... I'd die if that happened
lol
pretty much
I mean I can understand that
but for example
nor wise, but word-confused Derpy
well see, this is why derpy shouldn't become a larger character
I trust the FiM team to do her justice, though...
well yeah, I'm sure they'll do fine
I'm just saying *some* people wont like it
I suppose that's fair
10Hell - Disturbed FTW
lol
inb4 BOOOOOO YEAAAAAAAAAH
you know, I'm sure this is probably a minority opinion, but I'd like to see more CMC. At the very least, CMC interacting with the mane 6
I think they did imply a lot about Luna through the first two episodes.

nah friend on skype
I havnt checked out VGcats in a while
he made a pony comic, but then removed it

That one :P
First panel of latest VGC is 20% cooler than the rest.
if you look at comics prior to that one
Know why he removed it, Val?
he hid ponies in some of the comics
he "said" he didn't like the quality
which I can respect, but meh
made*
I saw that comic. It wasn't great.
it's probably because he removed it a few hours later
He removed it because he didn't like it.
Really?
but yeah, check the comic where he nostalgias about star trek
look very closely at Aeris' computer screen :P
At the time, I didn't know the comic was based on an episode because I didn't see any of the show yet.
haha
Beware the carrots.
lol
Yes, probably. :P
neve rment him
never ment him
I just saw that.
yeah
that's kind of why I think he just didn't want to "come out of the stable" yet

albeit slightly covertly
hey Barry

I'm just saying that it's a common societal norm

it's actually a pretty good movie
Yeah, that one kinda set it off as a meme
It's all subtitles, though.
That's the only thing that could keep it from being selected.
I know that it prevented a previous title from being selected.
wait, are subtitled movies not allowed?
which one?
Downfall.
4Subtitled movies are finnicky
awwwwww
no I mean which one didn't get picked because it had subtitles?
and here I was going to suggest To Live if I ever got the lottery :(

or rather wasn't allowed

In a minute.
ABANDON THREAD
/me still has dari on a leash
Dashite_alt, Skylanders: Spyro Adventures.
But everyone forgives them for it because they publish Call of Duty.
Oh
KARMA CHARGER IS COMMING.
Fucking Skylanders.
/me cuts Dari's leash loose.
I'm free!
/me runs aronud
It's aimed at children between 6 and 12
around*
open air roof I might add
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
And the greedy moves they pull and things Kotick says are forgiven because "it's just business."
Barry... I'm crying
07thanks
07yay, I land in a pile of floofiness
Skylanders. ;________________________;
I meant Insane_Lugia o0
07oh

07I'll tag along too
l0l
*That
Sorry, can't help myself sometimes
Kotick: "I'm charging more for CoD!" People keep buying.
oops nvm forgot had this darn straight jacket on
/me thought he cut it off? xD
A lot of them are kids that pay more attention to advertisements.
>enjoyed CoD4 :(
and that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you buy CoD games used...
Enjoyed CoD4 and MW2. :P
>never played multiplayer
I enjoyed the earlier ones.
07SOMEBODY LET HIM OUT OF THE ASSYLUM OMGOMGOMDSOGAFJIOWAUEIRTOU0Q234UI05ERJKGLJLK; *explodes*
oh Dari, we already knew you were a mindless drone <3
Stream's up.
i'm sad now, because i never beat the enw trilogy of spyro, and i grew up hoping for an evil dragoness that would fight spyro, then get turned good and the shipping would commence
oh NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
and then they did it
WOOOT
DURRRRGAAANNN
induring DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGAN
I loved the old CoDs.
/me sees a Karma Charger in the distance
wtf am i listening to...
Killstreaks are the worst idea ever.
OHGOD RUN AWAY!
KARMA CHARGER IN THE DISTANCE!
Vehrn...
does he just like adding superfluous letters to every name?
/me tackles karma charger out of a 20th storey window. "KARMAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
It was still fun.
:P
And have them whine about deathstreaks and cheap tricks.
4Who the fuck is talking?
/me needs to educate Dari on Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
dari
:P
4You sound like you're croaking
he's a brit, they are all cooky :P
lolwat is dari talking about?
Prepare to witness the full might of a Karma Charge.
4No it doesn't, I've spoken to you in Skype
hello
Half-Life 2: Deathmatch? Fuck that! C&C Renegade bitches!
hello Batrolinni
And BC2 is just rage fuel for me because the servers insult me for playing badly.
phhhhfff, C&C
/me tackles Nick and carries him over a 80 mile distance.
4No, it's not
4No, not at all
is he talking right now? i can't hear
4Dude, seriously, you sound you're 73
4*like you're
LOL
oh lawd
4Maybe
>HL2 is boring
HL 2 was good.
Boooring!
The Singleplayer is great
Valve games are the worst games ever. They just rush shit out every couple of months without any quality control.
Played it once. Tried to play it again, and I can't do it.
trolololololo
well to be fair
recent Valve is like that
Oh.
old Valve wasn't
but recent Valve definitely yes
Yeah I'm kidding.
I dunno.
I'd hate Valve to turn bad like the rest of the large publishers.
4Damn, that must have been one harsh cold
>implying they haven't already
I don't consider any of them to be good except Valve.
4Question, Dari
WHY CAN'T I FIND IT AND TURN IT OFF
4What are you playing?
I'm wary of Valve
and it's horrifying
4It looks pretty damn fleshed out
4Who doesn't like it?
me
*Team Fortress 2 adds hats!*
Val hates 75% of everything.
4Oh
4ValtheJean
He is very specific on his tastes.
lol
4It's like a plethora of goodies
but they're DAMN good
No
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAAAH
not the tea!
Eh, there are very few games I actually hate.
I'm not even hiding it
Seriously, he comeso ut as antagonistic.
4Of course it is
and I have yet to see anything I enjoy
It looks like a lot of fun, except I'm annoyed with the long monologues...
/me finds a leash made of adamantium and leashes dari with it.
MWAHAHAHAHA
I'm annoyed with the lack of any form of english mastery...
I hope you do understand that it is a parody, though.
oh I do
I AM DEH UBAHMENSH.
Oh, thanks SilverMane, might actually play this soon, then :P
but just because you're making a parody doesn't excuse being completely inept at it
he did an amazing job at it. it's one of the most highly lauded RPG on dozens of sites
haha
he did
4It's really good
4Only $3?
4Hell yeah, great deal
ok, i'm freaking out
there is some random people talking in my headphones
and i can't find them
Though I prefer Morrowind to most JRPGs TBH :P
4Morrowind
4Fuck yes
You not in Skype SilverMane? XD
this computer doesn't have skype
and Baldur's Gate 2... first one is a bit too clumsy
Icewind Dale, now that was a great RPG
And the power flickered.
Dashite,you have the right to not like a game.Just don't assume that everypony doesn't like it aswell.
I'm a redstone addict
4Oh
:P
Haven't played the first one.
TEAM FORTRESS 2
Wait, you don't like half-life due to bunny-hopping?
4I can't run TF2
GunZ
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING
L4D and TF2 are awesome in my opinion.
how the fuck does that matter?
?
4Speaking of zombies
I like S4 more then Gunz
I dun geddit SilverMane.
Dun ged ur expectations.

It's free subscription, yes
4Well
4The subscription, yeah
4Free to play
4Free to play, dari

/me raises his hand
Noting off the top of my head, no
02claw*
I liked the part where they get that belt and are like: "Wait...if the ogre we got this from was wearing that..."
Say "Mr Frodo" in that voice.

0Bernard is the best of those 4, but you won't know why for a great while
Don't worry, we'll reach the ground in approximately 10 minutes.
Intill then,what should we do?

0Barrier Break, he has Barrier on
0shield, even
I mean having lots of content is fine, but having that much story is... I dunno.
