I'd want that ship :/
HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLl

Wait, is there DEADBEARD in there?
NewDCD: Vore.
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The pirate ship was entirely real. All the shots were filmed in the ship. After the film, it was offered to anyone who would take it. No one wanted it, so the ship was scrapped.
I lost track of how many times this movie has made me say 'what.'
Who wouldn't want that ship?!

9No one wanted a PIRATE SHIP?
ida took it
Im on a boat

"looks like the ship just ...*glasses*... woodn't budge."
that ship is awesome
Who wouldn't want that boat!?
no one wanted to take the ship cause it cost a ton to move would be my guess
Meanwhile This was before the internet, so I'm not surprised.
I'd kill a man if i thought i'd get a pirate ship out of it
And this ship is useful...
6:35 all
Why.
wait, the bot can talk?

You are a Pirate
Meanwhile Also, probably before One Piece, too.
WE'RE ON A BOAT MOTHERFUCKER ON A MOTHERFUCKIN' BOAT
I would buy it in a heartbeat.
As much as I'd want my own freakin ship, I wouldn't have any place to keep it. Dumb landlocked state.

NO IT'S NOT.
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The cast was not allowed to see the pirate ship before the scene was shot. When they did see it, some of the kids said "Holy shit!" The scene had to be re-shot without them cursing.
7nope
WAAAH
Twilight is so a pirate wannabe.

A knife in BOTH eyes? Major overkill...
Talk about staring daggers at someone! HURHUR
lol

Always they fall through the floor when they say something convienant
Dman, no idea but I think either Bjornfot or Polarfire has it.
Oh those kids.

It seems like they'd be used to finding corpses by now
Cool!

They had a lot of spare knives.
Nice trivia right there!
STARES STARES
kids and their potty mouths!
8Daggers in eyes...i guess thats the literal term of Eyeing Daggers xD *failpun*
Should have left the take in. It'd spice up the movie to have one swear just right there.
They cussed some swears earlier, I don't see why they would be necessary to reshoot.
Dman, how do I shot Kraid?
12and I must poof now
Data stop talking in the third person

One-eyed Willy had WAAAAAAAYYYYYYY too much time on his hands.
lotsa porn
13I hate being hungry at this time of night
Pirates clearly have too much time on their hands
Bjornfot, do you have a number?
Someone was really bored.
whose job is it to count these things?
The ship in its entirety would probably be a huge historical find.
and Dman, I'm just shooting round after round at his stomach, to no avail

0Thats what I call DEAD TREASURE!
hi
0hiya
He's the only one with an eyepatch?
11RANDOM SHIP TRIVIA: One Eyed Willie's ship, The Inferno, was 105 feet long and took 2-1/2 months to construct. It was modeled after Erroll Flynn's ship in The Sea Hawk. The sails required more than than 7,000 square feet of material. Some of the ship's rigging was recycled from the Pirates of the Caribbean ship at Disneyland,
11which was being renovated at the time.
I hate death by dying.

That chicken is covered in sticky stuff...

MFW SWEETIE BELL IS BEST CMC PONY
13Thanks |D
Scootalo is the best because she is fun to hurt
...How often is there treesap in the plans?
Namby pamby story makrs.
Screw you, Sweetie Bell is BEST
9but honestly aside from FE and maybe Zelda I'm not much into Nintendo games any more
dear mister guy hosting this great show, please give me that wallpaper
I call horseapples. You can't clean tree sap that easily
talking about sex =/= showing pornography
I honestly want to know what Scootaloo had planned with that cannon
Or marks.
PREPARE YOURSELF I FIGHT FOR MY FRIENDS D: D:
EVERY PONY IS BEST PONY.
13Came up with it like 3-4 years ago
AWESOME NIGHTMARE MOON WALLPAPER
Pokemon didn't have a failing game, yet
Zelda II was made in the 80's
He's okay in Brawl, but god do I hate what they did with him in Radiant Dawn.
Scootaloo is best chicken.
Fluttershy!
Fluttershy is coolest pony

Fluttershy?
MyLittleIke, y u no like smash bros and/or mario galaxies?
Schootaloo is best chicken
07me faved it
Fluttershy is coolest pony!
0she talking bout Derpy!!!
11Scootaloo just used her wings to fly
The DS Castlevania games are fun.
and/or metroid
9does that mean Ike X Scootaloo is canon?
derpy?
...fluttershy.
wand of gamelon=BEST ZELDA GAME EVER
10Silverscreen. I respect that you're misguided, but Scootaloo is only good CMC, and you're just gonna have to realise that eventually

Pinkie Pie doesn't afraid of anything
Samurai Jack is the best Chicken

WHAT IS IT
Gummy...I love that blank stare of his
Fuck we're stuck.
No one speaks of the CDi games
dosn't afraid of anything
loll dashite
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
10^
She hovered above the ground slightly.
RD x Scoot is canon
well, fuck
In b4 friendship
That's not flying.
RainbroDash yfw Sweetie Bell is best CMC
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THAT THING IS
oh I was guessing cloudkicker
but if i say that i'll be kicked 10th time D:
Dat theme song
0AHHHHHHH
that's cuz CDi doesn't exist
gummy ftw
CDi is EVIL!
All of the CMC are amazing, actually. They get annoying in big doses, but they're amazing in small amounts.
sing along!
Scoot x Chicken, totally OTP
dat opening
Soarin' x Scootaloo. Ed likes chickens, eddy.
10edwardnewgate, MFW is irrelevant, since it's not true
BLARG!
hope we get a 20% cooler intro song in season 2
My favorite game EVER is Zelda CDI.
friiiieeends
0MAGIC!
I loved the cd-i MLP games!
blaughhh
I used to hate this opening, and I fucking love it now!
0and sandwich makes it all complete
Ed X Scootaloo
4Barry, PM
Cmc is like sugar.too much makes you sick but just a little is good.
SoarinXPie...need to write a clopfic about that
0Yay
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEENSSSSSSS
We need to start holding these chats over Skype. So we can actually sing the themesong.
Deraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
blasphemy, zelda CDi doesn't exist
9Dman: Mario games are fun but I can't get into it. I like my games to have some sort of plot or atmosphere that can be taken seriously, or an intensely comedic one. Mario's "middle group" of an existence is not exactly the best territory for me.
Sweetie Bell X Fabric
TF2 FTW
12I approve of that drawing :3
moral of the cmc: CHILDREN ARE IDIOTS
... nope still hate the opening theme.
BZZZZZZ
there should be an episode where dj-pon-3 gets her own club
DIES
i agree jon...
"Equestrian Pie"?
Vermits!
/me 6suddenly harrumphs at her sprite.
>name your child applebloom >she can't do anything related to apples. :T
Wait did I just here a gear shift?

brbrbrbbbrbrbrbr
O this is the episode Pinke messes up her story with how Equestria was made right?!?
too much slideshow-ish for me. cyas tomorrow
story time!
I always wonder how flashbacks worked
9as for SmaBro...it's fun but it gets old early. I guess I'm just used to my quarter-circle-forwards and overcomplicated movements
or what?
Combustiblelemons: http://hejibits.com/comics/2011-03-07-gray-matter.png
littlemac
big mac crying?
little mac is best colt
Little Mac
aww, bigmac
wow, o granny smith was that old even when AJ was a filly?
awwww little mac
I wanna tell storys in flashback
love how AJ is the only Apple who is citrus colored ot apple colored. so her backstory is even kinda neater
Real men cry manly tears
how old is she really?
Anybody think AJ shouting "thieving vermins" at the bunnies is a spoof on the tale of Benjamin Bunny?
10huntywunty 'canon' means it's official, not fan-made content
Seen this episode to death. I'm off to make a grilled cheese
I'm a massive plot junkie, and I can still like Mario for the gameplay. That said, I understand why others might not.
I've been to Manehatten
0tiny big mac ftw
nacht rainbow loon :)
little mac <3
I love the puns
RainbroDash No, not until we unite and troll Dari harder than he's ever been trolled
From 1990 to 2006, there were no traditional Mario Platformers
6HML?
orange!
how quaint!
So wait. Applejack got her cutie mark later than anyone else in her class, yet she got hers when she was younger than the CMCs?
>,<
the living end?
oranges related to apples, mind blown
10EdwardNewgate let's do it.
0dat laugh
6Before you leave, have you played Yume Nikki since I last mentioned it?
Quite.
Manehattenite
Protip: the Oranges are a succeeding branch of the Apple Family who sold off most of the family assets in order to deal the stocks.
wow
0dat voice
So... In a sense, she earned hers so much earlier?
best applejack ever.
where as cannon is a weapon that fires lead balls at targets

MyLittleIke: i'm still following metagame strongly. actually, even now there's new stuff being found out, so that's nice. i'd suggest you went over to youtube /user/izaw91 He is awesome. he plays matches (competitively), uplaods save to pc and replays on emulator - thus 720p crystal clear recordings. it's awesome.

fluttertroll
/me 4has never ridden in a train
I wish Rainbow dash kept her filly hairstyle when she grew up

Scootaloo can't fly because she doesn't know how.
NOOO, really?

Madame le Flour and Gummy aren't poniesw
no way
no, really
commence song in 60 seconds.

It's a rather groundbreaking season.

Snails is replacing Twilight Sparkle.

this thing really doesn't make a lot of sense
I don't see custompony
FOOLS!
why are they transparent?
TWIXIE
Then this would end to easily
0Twillight loves and tolerates it later
They're loving and tolerating in the other direction
MOMMY
NO
since spike lives as twi's assistant and doesn't go to school, is he a child laborer?
Actually i like snails i just think snips is a bad influence
Trixie thought she said the great and powerful trixie didn't want to be disturbed!
The bear is made out of stars.
8the only thing snails is good for is trolling the shit out of !!RainbowDash on /meta/
hunty, I tried it, it doesnt work when its cranky
@nevermind NOOOOOOOO

Trixie is the only pony that speaks correctly.
0SPOILER: PONIES CONFIRMED FOR SEASON TWO
DAT WINDOWS
YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
11Snail's talent is study of Gastropod, hence the snail. He also happens to be slow. Snip's talent is hair cutting.
0theyre anthropormorphic celectial bodies
What is it that you can't wait until morning to disturn Trixie!
DAT WINDOW
Egad, a window!
Marmaduke do you like bananas?
Love and tolerance works in many situations. This is not one of them.

Wait, who's streaming? NewDCD?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Trixie=Elmo=Bob Dole?
*SCREAM*

John Sappington Marmaduke does not like bananas, nor does he like where this is going
I once saw a comic where the Mane Six rape Snails...
4@NewDCD: Nah

I like how the hidden moral of this episode is to not be a jackass when you meet a celebrity
Fail Trixie
tHE bRAVE AND pOWERFULL tRIXIE
piece of cake
peace
And then Trixie genuinely tried to take down a bear the size of a house.
John Sappington Marmaduke is actually the dog.

Trixie needsa bout...
..5000000more feet of rope.

no she wont
SPOILER ALERT
Twist X Gummy
I can't.. I can't I never have no can vanquish an ursa major I just made the whole story up to make me look better.
@Ghosties I'm still waiting for her to cast level 3 Eroticism
CHEERILEE
0Trixie is actually a mastermind. If this was daytime, she could have trapped it in a rainbow cage.
I'm not a huge fan of twilight's hair
MADE IT UP?!!!!
POSER!!!
EdwardNewgate nope.avi
haha
what's wrong with trixie? she's a goddamn magician/actress, it's not supposed to be real
0bear uses growl
Dramatic Twilight
They can't seem to keep the bears size consistant
TWILIGHT, KILL IT WITH LOVE!
nuu
0its not very effective
4Shame on you, TheGreatandPowerfulTrixie
LETS DO THIS
Rainbow_derp is my OTP
0Thus being angry at them for bringing it during the night.
MAGIC IS REAL
cowardly Rainbow Dash
MAGIC IS VERY REAL
0Charlie Sheen can vanquish a Ursa Major
Machop should use low kick
YOU'LL SEE
0bon bon didnt have her cutie mark?!?!?!?!
Twilight might have been my favorite pony if she wasn't so condescending to her friends
YOU'LL ALL SEE
Even read a fic about it
or should I say Cowardly loser
LOVE IS POWER
lllllllloooooooooooolllllllll
0MAGIC IS THE REAL-IST
There is no magic, only lost physics
back in Washington I see
0Twilight uses music... its super effective!
silly twilight? all you have to do is laugh at it?
0NICE music
that's the ursa's jam
TWILIGHT used NR 16!
RESPECT THE MAGIC RESPECT IT!!
copperpot
OVERDRIVE!
8BECAUSE FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC
TWILIGHT USED TELEKINESIS!
twilight can be condescending, she's that much better. sorry.
She's using magic to win, sort of like the Macross movie
and the town's water supply is lost forever
Why
DRILL POWER
Twilight's turning it up to 11!
MOO
8dontcha know

Cow assault

:O
canadian cows lol

4I can't help but wonder how much mana Twilight used up for this scene. Her reserves must be completely depleted afterwards
Don'tcha know
>Why
TWilight don't you know your supposed to allow it to ferment before you let someone drink it

WAIT, YEAH FLUTTERSHY IS NOT IN THIS EPISODE
0ghosties roll for mana regen
0Twillight used mana pot
QUICK, USE YOUR ULTIMATE
I had never noticed that.
0Celestia's voice: "Twilight, your will is dangerously low, watch that."
NOOOO I'VE BEEN DEFEATED BY THE POWER OF LOVE
she passed out trying to put a cuttie mark on applebloom
8dont talk shit about wisconsin, marmaduke!
0twilight uses pamper... ursa minor has been defeated!
/me huggles Insane_Lugia
WE WILL HATE YOU
Skarner's ultimate
11Wisconsin sucks. :P
so appearently fake cuttie marks take more power then moving the ursa minor
twilight, your health is low, do you have any potions? or food?
how does fluttershy not have a heart attack every other day?
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD @abdesius
@Ghosties phhffff, she just used a level 7 sequencer to get her major level spells out in one round (mfw you actually know what I'm talking about)
I'm taking direct contrl of this operation
4@Abdesius: DAT FABLE REFERENCE
John Sappington Marmaduke has every right to mock any state in the union. It is a free internet
Get out of town witch!

4Okay, okay, all mods stop fighting : /
suddenly, we discover Hipster_Brony is Wisconsin.
and then Pinkie and Fluttershy went back to their sex.
"all hat and no cattle" is the perfect way to reduce the cowboy wannabes I went to high school with
Eeyup.
that's not how you spell ohio
HAI LYRA
0WISCONSIN IS KNOWN FOR CHEESE. THIS MAKES IT AWESOME IN MY BOOK.

9AN URSA MINOR IS A HG GUNPLA
holy fucking shit
It looks like a molerat
we are ashamed of the escaped snooki
/me 4once had cheese curds from Wisconsin. They were *awesome*
You may have vanquished an ursa minor but will never have the amazing show stopping abilitys of the great and powerful Trixie! *smoke appears runs off*
So then what is Applejack calling Twilight

0OH GOD

/me brohoofs dermathil
9AND AN URSA MAJOR IS A PERFECT GRADE

IT'S BIGGER THAN CTHULHU
Now to flee!

AWESUM MAJIK
8ghosties: because wisconsin cheese is best cheese

*Wreck town.Receive mustaches*
Give em 34! GIVE THEM 34!!!
Sugarcube = pony Beer?
Poor Trixies home :(
BANISHED

why are you showing sympaty to trixie again?
11And then Trixie ran to the nearest candy and gift shop and bought a shitload of secret admirer gifts for Twilight.
4I agree with that, Hipster
9you are now imagining Snips voiced by Ragna the Bloodedge. I don't know why I imagined that.
@Hipster_Brony California cheese is better
