ida took it
9why.jpg
"looks like the ship just ...*glasses*... woodn't budge."
that ship is awesome
no one wanted to take the ship cause it cost a ton to move would be my guess
And this ship is useful...
6:35 all
Why.
than again, expensive?
YEAAHHHHHHHHH
I'd be a damn Gokaiger
it is kind of weird NewDVD

Should have left the take in. It'd spice up the movie to have one swear just right there.
They cussed some swears earlier, I don't see why they would be necessary to reshoot.

11RANDOM SHIP TRIVIA: One Eyed Willie's ship, The Inferno, was 105 feet long and took 2-1/2 months to construct. It was modeled after Erroll Flynn's ship in The Sea Hawk. The sails required more than than 7,000 square feet of material. Some of the ship's rigging was recycled from the Pirates of the Caribbean ship at Disneyland,
11which was being renovated at the time.
