WHAT GOSE ON IN MY HEAD
geeky-brony: also, if you asked me 4 years ago, I'd say that I hated violin. But now, since I'm playing for myself (and kinda everyone, but not quite yet), I love it...

User0: I'm learning how to play the piano and so far I'm loveing it
cow334: What.the.FUCK.
Panda: Here's what he said after I asked him that question. 'I just choose to hate it. I don't give a (squee). I choose to hate it. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE! HE HASEN'T SEEN THE SHOW HOW CAN HE HATE IT! :'(
im be back
Ponies47: Discriminators gonna discriminate
Esta canción suena dramáticopero yo soy malo en la escritura de palabras.Si usted no habla Inglés,esto probablemente suena muy bien.Probablemente pensaría que estoy cantandopelea de cosas serias bonita.Pero en realidad, estoy cantando 'combatela falta de cosas que estoy cantando 'combate.Esta parte es intensa.Y emocional.Siempre y cuando no lo entiendo.:D
sonicrainboomer259: I know now you now you no
Ponies47: then he is just hates it... no point of trying to force it on him :(

Don't need no translator :p

cow334: Darn you and your lack of worry over intonation...
03the rest was just walking the wrong places and having to go back
03>_>
cow334: DO EET. I'm curious on what it means
Panda: Not forcing. Just trying to convince him to watch an episode. ALL 22 MIN! JUST SITTING THERE DOING NOTHING ELSE BUT WATCHING IT! :(
03so needless to say we all hate each other right about now :P
User0: what you mean
Fantastic!

Darksouls was an amazing game!
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID IF YOU DONT UNDER STAND This song sounds dramáticopero I'm bad at writing palabras.Si you do not speak English, this probably sounds very bien.Probablemente think I was serious things cantandopelea bonita.Pero actually, I'm singing 'combatela lack of things I'm singing' emocional.Siempre intensa.Y combate.Esta part is they do not understand

Ponies47: well,in most minds, my little pony=Gay,which is understandable,with what the franchise USED TO be. :P

SolairePony89: hmmmm that the hard part I got one free box right here if you would like the sample
08,01Sylandest: this actually happened a few days ago
hen3ry: FLANKS, not flakes
more like a manwich^^
it has a gun in the cover
therefor not good
/me hides
03LOL mentioning manga in anime
08,01oh
And no pony answers my question :(
/me happily tries some flank
08,01i'm repeating myself
SolairePony89: I was answering Polydunami's wonderings.
08,01i'm repeating myself
08,01Panda: i'm not sure, but probably
hen3ry: Oh, right 6_9
recursiveness is recursive.
in http://myanimelist.net/anime/8675/Seitokai_Yakuindomo < they even mention specific pages of the manga in the NE{
Is sad now and feals ignored :(
*nep
03LOL what
08,01definition of recursion: see recursion
Ponies47: MAAAN I OVE YOU
03I'm not watching NEPs, fairly pointless if I can just open the next ep
I'M B ACK
lakingsfans: that was quick
Ponies47: What was your question?
I feal ignored because no pony answered my question :(
Ugh, when I think of the word recursion, I think of ENDLESS EIGHT :|
Ponies47: what was your question
ehh 5 hour energy
Ponies47: what would that be?
watch at least 1 NEP in the beginning of the season. the style is unique to PA
08,01Sylandest: it's not just work, it's the con too. and this past few days, i've had 3 other people say that. but i don't have time to take time off now
Polydunami: gah!
Exactly
Ok If I can convert 3 poeple in bronies would 4 bronies working together could they make somebody else into one? 6_9
08,01but i've said i'll rest next weekend
and sometimes the NEP contains unique content not in NEXT or CUR_MAIN_B
03PA?
Bai everypony*Yawns*
PA works
08,01but first, i need to work extra hard this week
03that's the anime company?
Ponies47: yeah, but you cant over do it
Ponies47: ...most likely?
AB is PAw's first anime as primary animators
Ponies47: If one brony can convert others, then hell yeah 4 can
previously they used to draw mainly backgrounds
i came back on my mobile i'm accually laying in bed while doing this
You know, tho... if they were ever dumb enough to make me a mod - and I was foalish enough to agree - I would totally stream endless eight.
you'll notice in the first few eps their faces look wierd occasionally
Haruhi to infinity. :D
03yeah

03I kept thinking my screen was dirty xD

ahem
Petrified_Discord: it means to gang bang... but not the sexual one :(
03I know some words, but I suck at understanding it spoken
03hence why translators for anime are so hard to find
PFFFTHAHAHAHHA
Non-sexual gang bang. Seems legit :D
03even if you can read/write Japanese, actually hearing it is the hard part

:D
Ponies47: I dunno, the setting seems... unusual.
best game ever
XD
11,01Dunno if this is Phase4 streaming himself.
00,02its not me
Ponies47: what process?
thtas funny
We ain't a cult, we ain't a religion we're just a fanbase
NEVER MIND :|
not EVERYONE as to like or enjoy MLP
00,02http://www.youtube.com/user/ProtonJonSA << lets play is from here
:D
dieing in cutscenes?
BEST GAME EVER
i enjoy watching MLP
fucked up games we used to live in
lakingsfans: seems legit right?
So much for being locked. :D
xxMoopyxx: HOLY SHIT I DO TOO!
eeyup
that's just fair
Ninjazz: Lol indeed
Hi Ninjazz! :$
Ninjazz: Technology
Hey there, MadSurge! :)
If a friend does catch you watching MLP then ok kool, if he's interested about it then that's great
Ohai Ninjazz :)
who is playing this :P
but please for Celestia's sake DO NOT FORCE IT INTO SOMEONE
Ponies47: Im really sorry to trample over your enthusiasm, but CrimsonPhoenix is right.
But im not a freakin clopper i do not clop to ponies
Ninjazz: Lollipop Chainsaw is awesome!
Hey there, Ponies47. :)
"D
*:D
Phase4: i am going to get my game ready
Ninjazz: Almost.
MadSurge, GRAGH! Don't remind me that I can't play it. :(
it's so static
Moopy... YOU CLOP TO PONIES?
Lex Luxor i best pony
Ninjazz: oh sorry :(
is*
i said i DO NOT CLOP TO PONIES! :[
Yes they may not like it but it never hurts to atleast try right? No force. Just see if they wanna watch an episode.
MadSurge, it's fine. :$
AR U SHURE?
Ninjazz: Tara had so much fun recording her lines, you can tell :D
I'm not gonna stuff it down there throats
MadSurge, I can imagine. :D
i need a spot in a voice acting thing
Ponies47: good boi
KiwiBoi777: Can I have a treat!?!
lol Lex Standee.
Phase4: Reminds me of the Beyond Good and Evil Puzzle. :P
Ponies47: if they spend some time on teh interwebz I assume they have already encountered the show in some form. If they havent watched it by now then they are probably not interested
Ponies47: of course you can:D
And Kotor
i just watch them of enjoyment jeeze guys
Ponies47 that's fine but you don't have to HOPE them to catch you
i used to have this game but i never knew there were this many glitches in here
KiwiBoi777: YAY! *Noms on treat*
that ain't a good mentality
this game is mean to people with dyslexia
g'day!
Seems legit
CrimsonPhoenix: Yes I know. I would rather be an accident that wasen't planed
Like when I told my mom. That was planed
Nice boss fight!
.Ponies47: why not just ask them in conversation? Isnt that a bit more... easy?
seems legit
SUPERPOCKET
endless pocket of doom?
just like ponies
Alchemist: Talk is good. I should atleast try that. They don't know that I'm a brony
well Alchemist considering the target demographic I doubt that would be easy
the stream is down?
nope
has my stream taking a shit again
just like all the boss fights in old games
:D
hey Mutterguy
Mutterguy: no, it's on
Pans cant spell
it's a fact
Phase4: y i has no stream
00,02not sure
Ok because I was about to post a Beaurepaires ad
BEST BOSS FIGHT EVER!
GREAT BOSS FIGHT
seems really hard
:D
/me wishes he had a boogie chair
*Looks at clock* hmm 3:03 AM. Yeah I should TRY and get some sleep so.....
Phase4: i think mips embed has dun goofed
GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY!
:)
it's a very kiwi advert
CrimsonPhoenix: the facts are the same regardless of you bringing it up in conversation, or they "catch" you watching it. The mindset of the "target" is the same in both situations.
night ponies
Night Ponies47 <3 wubz
gnight Ponies47! sleep well!:)
this boss fight was really hard it took me all day to beat it
/me snuggles Bunny_Maid_Luna
Night, Ponies47. Take care. :)
I still have the stream, JRP. I even have it popped out.
Hey, everybrony!
O_O
jump like a pony!
Pon!?
PONY :D
*pony
Hugs xxMoopyxx BroKnee MahBoi777 Ninjazz
PONY!!!!!!!!!
yeah whats up
i heard pony ;p
lolz
GOOD NIGHT!
:)
Night :3
/me hugs Ponies47 back
he said it he must be a brony :P
This game is a glitch
he has no idea what he said
Alchemist, you got a point, but for the whole catching one watching the show I was thinking about the animation and the characterization that the "intruder" would be welcomed into
nigth Ponies47
Phase4: please changed embeds
/me Huggues Poies47
the refresh button! it does nothing!
Ponies47 xD
00,02k
00,02time to reboot
HE GONE!
Om, I think it's the other way around. I'm pretty sure it's actually a glitch that people think is a game.
Phase4....oh my god that was some funny stuff
00,02[B]JRP2234, Mutterguy: it may have been the way mips works
00,02will probably work fine when tf2
he said jumping like a pony but ponies don't jump that way on the other hand he should have said stop jumping like pinkie pie cause that was pinkie pie jumping :D
dat manly chest
tf2? better start up steam now...
Hey cow334 brb im going to go make me some fruit snacks to get ready to go watch MLP episodes reactions ok
OtakuTom: I don't see why it cant be some of both. Off topic, his chest looks very pointy
Anyone here play CrossFire? :l
I'll brb everypony :3
http://i.imgur.com/iB42I.jpg
Phase4: mips is refusing to let me watch
xxMoopyxx: kk
cool brb
Om: it cud poke an eye out
is it wrong to say what is tf2?
MahBoi777: Superpoke!
xD
Phase4: stop and restart stream
Oh god, this room too!?!?
my eyes are focusing out of vision
is that a good thing?
whuzzat Crispmilk?
Sometimes. >.>
00,02havent started streaming yet
my eyes are sad :(
CrimsonPhoenix: I dont think seeing the animation would change the affiliation, because the first impression is not aesthetical, its about content. He will see colourful ponies and make a judgement by that.
lakingsfans: don fall asleep during stream/nonstream!
lakingsfans: Have them drink orangejuice
I do that too often
i'm trying not to!
Phase4: i see it
i'm telling my eyes to stay awake
or they will pay
00,02are you guys getting a stream
Yup!
listen to me eyeballz!
Clear on my end
00,02i cant see my own stream XD
Phase4: just change embeds
yea I see it lol
Thats bad
yeah were gettin it
Phase4: i has stream
00,02oh there it is
i think mips is having problems again
00,02[B]JRP2234, yours working?
my eyes are disloyal
now it is
yo dawg, we heard u like streams
And streamception begins
Alchemist, but at least they will be in place and the chance might be higher to present not only the content but also the quality behind the whole show.
CrimsonPhoenix: I think seeing the show from afar on a screen by surprise and bringing it up in convo doesnt change the person's mindset.
Phase4: Look what you have done! Now the screens will go on forever!!!!
I see windows D:
how can i fall asleep when i'm laughing at all this :D
we put streams in your streams so u can stream while u stream
BEEP...my ears bleed now
Desktop Ponies! :3
ponies there the best eyedrops
00,02Vordox, you there?
Phase4: Untagged
Dat quick responce. XD
It won't no but at least they would already be there instead of desperately attempting to drag them to your computer screen and set them to watch an episode
lakingsfans: Until I read your name, I thought it said laughing gas
Phase4, it's working
for me that is
Phase4: Also, that Timing again :P
that to
Dem PMs.
Om: that's not a bad name actually
Phase4: can i share a video link
Ninjazz: OH SHUSH it's PRIVATE stuff :P
>.>
<.<
I remember I was watching Philomena episode and my 24 years old brother came in and watch a good couple of minutes of it
MahBoi777: That is why I never took the time to read it xD
I saw nothing, Vordox. XD
xD
you know what suck the heads means?
brb
he did seem intrigued by the quality but of course he's not into cartoon anymore
00,02brb
Ninjazz: U saw. Teh wurld
it's about eatinjg
lakingsfans, it's about eating.
Damn it.
you see i was with my buddy keith once
The phase pony is untagged catalogue
Om, and teh world... scared me.
00,02urgh
yay
00,02things have gone wrong
/me pets Espeon
Ninjazz: Shh shh shh, Pinkie will be her to show you it isn't that bad :3
00,02bbl
you know how bored i got
BOO!
http://youtu.be/uewKXpDxFGk
why u stop stream
THATS HOW BORED I WAS
Don't worry, Phase4, you could just have Rarity on instead and things should be good. :3
oh phase4 got the kerbal Space program demo. i can happily get into space but two of my attempts have netted my a planetoid...
*me
going to space is a bitch
Om, now I feel like singing. :D
Ninjazz: Sing it brothah!
well im gonna go to bed, night!
CrimsonPhoenix: also sorry for arguing this early, had a terrible night.
and what I've been trying to say is that there's still a better chance to catch an interest to that person if he catch you watching the show. A better chance doesn't mean a definite
Irish_Pony: Sleep well~
Night, Irish. Take care.
I got KSP and can't even get airborne with a spaceplane >_>
I'm not upset nor angry
Om, the brother is sleeping. :(
this is quite an intelligent discussion
Ninjazz: Hum it :)
CrimsonPhoenix: okay I can agree with that, but I think that increase in chance is trivial.
Hello Everypony
Om, that... is a good idea. :_
:)
Phase4: what have i done: http://youtu.be/uewKXpDxFGk
Hi Storm_Chaser
I could compromise on that
Ninjazz: can ya tell Bunny_Maid_Luna i wub her for me? :$
Hey, StormChaser.
Irish_Pony, if I see her, she'll get the message. :)
Ninjazz: thx lad
"My buddy Keith tried camping out on top of a building once. He was shooting crows, but the police were too busy teargassin' him to ask what he was doin' up there. He screamed for an entire year every single time he opened his eyes! Oh, man! At first, it was funny; then it just got sad, but then it got funny again! Oh, man!""Man, I love malls. I do. Once, I was in this mall, up in Atlanta, and these guys were dancing
Irish_Pony, you're... welcome. :$
i learned all that from the game :3
lakingsfans...elis..you thing now is the best time?
-__-
name spell failure
Irish_PonyWub you too :)
Hi
Bunny_Maid_Luna, Irish_Pony wubs you. :3
hi
what's up
/me hugs IowaBrony and OtakuTom, giggling
"I ever tell you about the time my buddy Keith drowned in the Tunnel of Love? You wouldn't think it could happen 'cause the water's so shallow, but that's how it gets you, man. Overconfidence. Keith was with his lady at the time, and he was yellin' for her to save him, but she didn't want to get wet."
YAY :D
My computer is crazy 6_9
CrimsonPhoenix: I tortured myself by watching several atheist vs theist debates last night and what I concluded was no matter how good points/reason one can come up with, the other side wont agree/convert, that how powerful a mindset can be.
dawwww
Bunny_Maid_Luna, just tell it that everything is going to be just fine.
cow224...you gonna 1v1 phase?
HOW DO I TRUMPET
conver obviously not but compromising possibly
what is with twilights eyes?
I am so confused right now..
come back to this awesome Lol
then again if we're talking about relgions then yeah there's nothing we can do
Phase4: show the new one...
but to respect the other views
Shamroc: yes but he has to get some stuff under check real quick just give him sone time
cow224.. i know i was just asking
Suddenly, beard
O Pinkeh XD
"I ever tell you about the time my buddy Keith fell out the rollercoaster? Yeah, he didn't drop far, mind you, just onto the tracks, but the carnival people wouldn't stop the ride 'cause all the other people paid good money and Keith snuck on for free, so he had to dodge for, like, 20 minutes or so."
BY PINKIE'S BEARD!
:D
Shamroc: oh i didnt mean to sound like a jerk or nothing sorry man
I can't see the stream anymor
YESH! <3
I like this
UH OH

OH O
esping about, the usual
OH
Shamroc, the Pheonix Wright one?
Ninjazz: i made a wtf
Wah. Ha. HAAA!
Ninjazz: Wouldn't you like to put some holes with Rarity~
CrimsonPhoenix of course, the only thing I brought up religion is because I think there is no right or wrong answer as being religious is a mindset. Same with MLP, you have to have a certain mindset to like it.
Ninjazz..no the apple jack bucking one..
For some reason, this reminds me of Rhythm Heav-OHHHHH!!
Shamroc, no I haven't... I must go!
Oh Hey MahBoi777 Nice reaction time! nah im just kidding *hugs and laughs*
ahh
where is sweetiebelle getting those gems?
or is it putt? Two t's or one hmmm
O_O
Crispmilk: yep, it's from those games <3
And Om... you knw I would... >.>
Storm_Chaser: :$
I couldn't disagree on that
/me hugs Storm_Chaser back
Ninjazz: No shame in that mah Niny.
/me is fghjasdgasdhghasdsadghjdsghjsdaghjsdghjsadghjsadghjsdaghjsadghjsdgj'
so What's everypony been up to?
I ever tell you about the time Keith and I made fireworks? Now, I didn't know shit about chemistry, but Keith figured "Gasoline burns, doesn't it?" Heh, third-degree burns on 95 percent of his body. Man, people in the next city over were calling to complain about the smell of burning skin."

that's not a bree
MahBoi777: I know, it's so great, i work at 7-11 as a cashier, i really like my job, especially when i go do manual work stuff xD

I found it, BroKnee: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/res/35944.html It has an archive of previously made OCs and a link to a zip file with instructions on how to make basic things like a trot.
Bunny_Maid_Luna my compeutor doesn't like deaviant art could you please tell me what the picture is
Vordox: SEE I KNEW IT!
yaay~ desktop fluttershy
I don't sprite Phase4 ... :P

oh ok just keep telling us of what shes doing
OtakuTom thatnk you so much ^-^
Vordox: i have your pic ;)

I'm gonna try my hand at making my OC on there once I get my gaming machine working. My laptop is now running Linux.

Panda: You call that "sprite"? :p

Hasn't been for a while.

Man its like 5:06 over here and the dang bird is chirping outside of my window that im sitting next to
Bunny_Maid_Luna: which episode?
That's why I watch the old ones :D
i mean my window
Gewd Idea.
Ninjazz: :( it sucks... cuz the same is happening to southpark
mario_pony: When Stewie kills Louis :)
Same here, Ninjazz. I haven't found Family Guy funny in a very long time. All I see is a writing team that can't think of anything, so they reuse old jokes way too much and make some jokes go on for way too long.
:O me too
Panda, we can't have nice things for long.
NO PYRO IS AS GOOD AS Shizuschlafen :)
$5 worth for a brony bracelet?
OtakuTom, I feel the same way.

How would you sleep if there is sun light at night?

Dat potter puppet
Evil_Spike shutting all the windows down?
Evil_Spike: It's a pain in the ass sometimes, cheapest way to solve it is taping aluminium foil over your bedroom windows
Well i better go see you on the xbox cow224
Ah
I've always wondered that
Good night every pony
Night.
that looks like a nice way home
Night Moopy
i always wondered what that pony on the desktop is looking at on his moniter
*Moopy has left the chat*
/me counted 13 seconds before he actually left
/me gently pats Ninjazz
and i was still to late to say bye
/me didn't care for that guy.

Meanwhile: That is not the pony way, shame on you
/me is gently patted :3
Meanwhile, he was originally a troll. what did you expect?
:D I love Phase4's OC flipping rockets
Shimmer: you mean "love and tolerate" ?
00,02:3
Ofc
that rocket doesn't look safe
http://gif-database.tumblr.com/post/25299975262
Shimmer: to hell with that.
Inb4 Discussion about the true meaning of L n T

Meanwhile: :'(
xD dat OC there
Hey there, Invi! :)
/me hugs Ninjazz :)
what time is it?
Ohai Meanwhile, Invi and Lil_B!
There's nothing to discuss, Love and Tolerate is ponychan muppetry. Not to mention a bad idea.
/me hugs back Invi
hi MadSurge ^^
Allo MadSurge.
it's fine. So long as Phase4 remembers to deploy the parachute and they don't land in hilly terrain they'll live
/me hugs MadSurge

Inb4 Phase4 forgets to do that.
Meanwhile: Lollipop Chainsaw is great :D
MadSurge: Um...ok?
MadSurge do you like "the voice"?
hi MadSurge.
WallDives! :)
WallDives: The wall!
oh? did he succesfullu land on Mun?
Lil_B: Tara had so much fun recording her lines :D

MadSurge, you can have Lollipop Chainsaw, I'm getting Pokemon Conquest later today.
hi Lil_B ^^

WallDives: only tried Pokemon Black :D

/me has nearly every pokemon game...
When I played Pokemon it was Gold.
http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/images/1310671996285.jpg
so was there a moon landing>
?*
you spin me right round
Pokemon black/white would be my only reason to get a DS. Luck has it, it's also the reason I don't get one. Ugliest pokemon designs ever
I have all the main series pokemon games (blue, red, yellow, gold, silver, crystal, etc)
what the hell was that Meanwhile
lakingsfans: that was incredibly smug Sulu.
Shimmer, only the ugliest ones since RBY. Since they ARE Monsters.
lol
OtakuTom: And there's no reason to get the rest
00,02well shit
i only have blue and red, because I'm retro XD
your screwed
fuck
Lil_B not even gold/silver? :O
At any rate, I liked Nobunaga's Ambition when I was little, so i'm getting POkemon Conquest.
Invi no
poof
fail
ded
all that work...
what are these buildings there?
http://derpy.me/LctJ-
I already have Black/White 2 preordered.
not a single fuck was givin that day
OtakuTom, /)
hey! I gave one!
Who'd you give it to?
i dont even have b&w 1
ok one fuck was givin that day
make a X-Wing!
also, Lil_B, I'm doing a Pokemon Stadium run atm.
WallDives Staduim for the N64?
yessir.
Yeah make a X-wing :)
I have that game :D
with Transfer Pak.
Stadium isn't for anything other than N64
Shimmer i got it for PC on emulator :D
it was on the N64DD, but we DONT talk about that.
I gave it in honor of the crew's family. Along with my bill as their lawyer
interesting
Invi: Emulators don't count :)
we are ready for liftoff
Inb4 it explodes.
engines?
I expected seeing a original 151 pokemon MMO this year at E3
But it never came :(
watch it blow up
Massive Multiplayer Online about Pokemon
GAAAAAAA NO QUESTION MARK KEY KJSAK:JD
fail liftoff
needs more speed
wooo! Lift off!
that was a close start
Shimmer, TPC doesnt want a MMO.
pull up
Shimmer: If you expect to see something you want at E3, you're gonna have a bad time.
so, you will NEVER see it.
what the hell
night night everypony :) HAVE A GOOD NIGHT~
behold! The N64 Tower! http://i71.photobucket.com/albums/i135/sweaterfish/NinTower.jpg
Night Panda.
didnt explode
what kind of flying was that?
Meanwhile: True dat
Man I hate E3.
Lil_B, *bows*
interesting flight Phase4
Lil_B: nintentower :)
well im out :)
lakingsfans: That wasn't flying, that was falling. With style.
Meanwhile: After all, all I wanted to see was a pokemon MMO and some info about FF vs XIII
WallDives I wish i knew what all these things even wer XD i only know the N64DD and the thing on the top
Neither came
Phase4, the controls are still horrible clearly?
Bye panda :)
00,02the real problem is the fuel tanks
00,02they dont drain evenly
lol
00,02so the craft ends up rear heavy
Mutterguy: controls?they arent bad
they are in the demo
Lil_B, I know the bottom two are DD variations, the 2nd from top is a Standard 64, the top, I dont know...
Mutterguy: idk theyre fine for me
Alright everypony i'm going to hit the sack
i'm done
Night lakingsfans.
I could just be shit
WallDives the top one is a copy station, to make a copys of your games on empty cartridges
ah. and now the riddle is solved.
Mutterguy: you do realize its hard to control it cause of air resistance?
Boom.
aw caterpillar exploded
well... it DID make an awesome car
Shrapnel and giblets everywhere.
You saying boom in chat adds effect to the screen
yeah but there's not a lot of things that I can use to reduce drag
/me watches Stream, listenes to VGA
Mutterguy: well how could you reduce it, its a rocket, not a racing car
mfw I havent opened a page for the stream.
Damnit Captain I'm a doctor not a pilot!
flat top fuel tanks spring to mind
Mutterguy: like canisters? there are fuel tanks like that
My chat is deeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
...BOO
/me is slapped
'ello mates
hoi dishwasher_EXTREME
Allo dishwasher_EXTREME.
Hello there, dishwasher_EXTREME.
Well i was thinking about structural elements you put on to of the tanks so they're nice curvy and not going to drag
Would anypony be interested in reading a creepypasta fic me and a friend are making?
I need feedback c:
Mutterguy: leave it to the specialists bro
:D
creepypasta?
Yup.
DO IT AGAIN
more bolts Phase4
Whats a creepypasta ?
bolts? where we're going, we dont need, bolts. *flips shades*
Its kind of a spin off scary fic.
Dark-Grimdark
oh
Its not going to be like cupcakes though.
*shiver*
00,02Mutterguy, more bolts
http://gif-database.tumblr.com/post/25108312552
creepypasta is scary lazagna
I will never be the same again xD
I'm suprised duct tape isn't a structural element
Nor will i look at pinkie the same.
lol.
Mutterguy or spare wooden planks
I cant look at pinkie pie after i read princess molestia... biggest mistake of my life...
Well time to sleep, goodnight everyone
bye, oh TheGreatAndPowerfulT !
bye TheGreatAndPowerfulT
dream about ponies
ugh phase
i want trixie toy
Phase4: it did it again
Phase4 Are you sure you don't wana tell me how you got your pony? Its a pain in the arse to make a new one xD
FINALLY! Someone Uploaded Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo! *listenes to the Final Boss Suite first*
"Crap the Cockpit is leAking! GET THE TWO BY FOUR!"
creeping chat
Phase4: stop and restart stream plz
Phase4: nvm
Mutterguy: http://gif-database.tumblr.com/post/24071674701
Spell-of-Gaming no. not intentionally ><
:P
00,02stream working?
xes

Who is streaming?
Yes, stream is working
Phase is streaming
I higly doubt the funktionality of this Vehicle
00,02Damn
LOL
00,02that things rugged

Well...they lived, at least :P
lol it survived...just as planned
Lol
:D at least they didn't die!
happy kerbals
Tonight on Destroyed in seconds!
I need to fix my gaming rig so I can finally start playing this. I bought it a few days ago ^^;
And then pony Phase4 pops out a rocket :D
what happends if you get it flying?
00,02XD
I see no way this could possibly go wrong.
Majestic_Sparkler I din't think we will ever see that :/
ok :o
The obvious solution is to add more wings :P
OtakuTom: OBJECTION! Thrusters is the way to go.
Majestic_Sparkler you stick rockets on it and get a contract with NASA
lol
wow, Lavos Theme+Meridian Dance+One-Winged Angel+Destati...
Hi everypony ~_~
hello
Hi FairysHuff
hey FairysHuff
hi FairysHuff
Thanks ^_^ Coming on here makes me feel better
i correct myself... a One winged Angel+Kefka Theme
Dancing Mad is best boss song ever, Lil_B
Dancing mad?
OtakuTom yes, indeed
oh, airplanes!
One Winged Angel is fun on Audiosurf
nu, one-inged angel is
hi FairysHuff.
FF VI final boss theme
WallDives: from Final Fantasy 6
WallDives Final Boss in Final Fantasy 6
I know this.
lOL
LIFTOFF!
UH OH
you said Kefka's theme, thats what I was correcting...
So many parachutes
will it survive
/me has the SNES Instruction Manual for FF3/6.
ooooo
THey live!
and the game too, but whatever.
AND THEN THEY LIVED :D
bang
yay
WallDives yes, in this Suite they mixed, Kefkas Theme with Dancing Mad and One-Winged Angel
how have you been FairysHuff?
and 3 other boss themes XD
Phase4 i acn't help but think you need far larger wings
thrusters everywhere
I was fine until a moment ago. The tutor I have for a class at the local high School has quit. And she was really nice. ~_~
Fire ze missiles!
So I'm a tad upset
Bummer.
yeh
barrol role
so sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
When it comes to boss themes that aren't for final battles, I'm particularly fond of Lords of the 4 Elements from FF IV
its goin down too fast
00,02Mutterguy, but those are the biggest wings
oh not anymore
/me pats FairysHuff on the back
It's not workiiiiiing!
and
BOOOM
But ah well. I can't let it get to me. It's upsetting but if I let it it will just pull me down. This is life. People move on as sad as that is.
Phase4: that may be the problem, it might add to much torque when turning. im just guessing tho
Ninjazz: Thanks ^_^
Anytime. ^-^
Cyborg*
I think the interface for liftoff horizontally is a tad wack.
Hmm...I'd probably swap the order of those wings. I think having the ones with the higher lift in front would be better to lift the nose up for takeoff.
wow that bent so much
ded
FairysHuff, true story...
*groud poke* BOOOM!
Lil_B: Mother3 is a nice game, but I really hate the story :(
OtakuTom: as long as it doesnt add to much torque inertia
MadSurge I kinda like it, its so open
WallDives: Shame it's not as easy to do as it is to say ^_^ heh
...Hi.
hey .... Om
Hmmm, that was pretty easy
wait,i added one dot too many
I like the Fake-Lead-in to One Winged Angel in the actual FF-Suite, Trolls everyone by actually playing the Chocobo Theme
lol
Lil_B: oh i saw dat :D
twilight_sprinkle: That is the.Worst.Possible. Thing!
god damit. im not gonna have internet for hours from now on... I hope i can entertain myself. anyways bye bye everypony :)
hi Om... Oô
Om: yep, ive doome dthe world
bye Majestic_Sparkler.
Lil_B: Hiiii O_O
damnit, already gone !
Cya maj...
Damn.
Does anypony wana play any games?
Phase4: maybe you try adding wings with those flippy plates or moving the one you have>
BroKnee maybe
Apparently Jack Ozboure, son of Ozzy Osbourne, has Multiple Scelerosis
Poor guy ~_~
hm, dancing nice is quite nice. still think one-wingeed angel is better
*dancing mad lol
oh dam
badaboom
I guess going that fast friction really pulls you apart
he needs more torque when turning
That was pretty one too.
vertical turning i mean
Whoa, what's that desktop pony?
Jim, I think thats Phase4's OC.
twilight_sprinkle Whats so greate about this song is that it fits so well to the main villain, and the overall final fight.
Whos that desktop pony? dundundun!
00,02tis ma oc
Who makes all those custion oc desktop ponies?
I was right. ^_^
it's so awesome /)^3^(\
Lil_B: i never played ff7 or 6. but in ff7:ac and in ff7:cc one-winged angel also fits great :D
twilight_sprinkle, boo, play them.
Okay, I've gotta log off for now. I'll try to be on again a little later.
OtakuTom: Have teh funz
WallDives: my psp broke, dont have anyth else to play on :(
LMAO! I just found this and just had to share ^_^ http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/06/17-1/marriage-counseling-sites-mascot-girl-attracts-japanese-males
twilight_sprinkle FF6 is the only one i actually played (FF5 and FF7 only the beginnings) but i have the soundtracks to all of them :)
oh japan~
^
hehehe ^_^
Japan is pervy, but still best country
people are gonna confuse the marrage counciling for a dating sim...
Oh Flash...You crash more than Phase4.
marriage^
00,02XD
00,02Om, true dat
Om: lol
Om, and thats why I stopped using the in-site chat.
hi Twi_Fi.
Hello WallDives
oh wow this political ad makes me want to punch the president in the face even harder. basically hes blaming everything on the previous president, even though hes corrupt and stupid
well, its off:D
Phase4: You lost something.
with which programm can i connect to the chat
00,02i did a bit
00,02Lil_B, any compliant irc client
other than the browser of course XD
00,02i use xchat
ok, thanks
00,02it makes a nice boatg
00,02boat'
How did you make the background of xchat black? Couldn't figure that out
That it does.
row row row your space boat
00,02i gota have dinner
00,02brb
twilight_sprinkle: Every politician is corrupt. Nothing new. The question is what do WE do about it?
Eat more taters
FairysHuff: eat them?
twilight_sprinkle: /) for similar ideas
twilight_sprinkle: I suggest a SAW style retribution ^_^
Om: [\
FairysHuff: idk what that is
unless it involves sawing politicans in half
twilight_sprinkle: Probably just as well. Those movies are disturbing.
I guess I'll use xCaht as well, hence i want to use Linux in the Future so i could get started with this :)
linux...of the future!
wow that reference died out fast
Just like the chat.
Om: It was your fault
That I can live with.
heh
Om you murderer
/me stabs the chat
dun dun DUUUUUN
Om doesnt usually kill things, but when he does, its the chat.
Topic: Needing to poop when someone else is using the shower... for HOURS!
Solution: You don't get to poop.
...what.
Om: Yup
FairysHuff: yeah i kno dat feel, i lived in a dorm with 3 people
I'm out fo an hour, but remember... I WILL be back Muhahaha >: D
Lil_B: And you are?
WallDives: I haz meme prowess
Om I'm Lil_B :/
Lil_B: Your going to deny someone the right to poop aren't you
Lil_B... Lil_B...No, sure you aint big b?
FairysHuff I'm currwent5ly olane in this house...
dat spelling
twilight_sprinkle: And they ALWAYS just start the shower right when you need to go O_o
Om nope...
Oh well. Nice to meet you.
FairysHuff: yes, it was ALWAYS like that, and one of them is in there for hours
twilight_sprinkle sorry you had to see this derp spelling XD
Yup
Lil_B: dont let it happen again!!!
anyway, I'm gone XD
Lil_B: One last thing
bai Lil_B
Om what?
Shoe size
I say we lead a revolution of seperate toilet and bothroom rooms ^_^
What is yours.
... 42
Hmm hmm. How many inches is that?
Om goddamnit! BYE!
Lil_B: I MUST KNO!
:(
Om: It's uroberos.
^_^
Om I don't know how much that is...
Is that like cerebro FairysHuff?
not Uroboros..
Lil_B: Can you check?
dammit WESKER!
WallDives: You maybe right. I'm not sure of the spelling.
Om if you tell me how exactly do you mesure it XD, i have a ruler that has Inches on one side
FairysHuff, the RE spelling is different from the normal spelling.
which is Oubouros.
Om: I don't know what cerebro is unless you mean brain.
Lil_B: Okay, but you have to use a aluminum ruler.
WallDives: Why is there a respelling?
FairysHuff: Sounds the same.
FairysHuff, because the Japanese are terrible at English spellings, generally.
Om thxcaoby
He finally left xD
as Om noted, phonetically, its the same, so no one cares.
Om: Wall and call sound the same but are different. You fail at logic ^_^
especially not the Localization staff.
26 and 1/4
WallDives: I think your may have confused the meaning. Uroboros is the nevereding snake that eats it's own tail.
It is.
FairysHuff: Logic is for chumps
Ouroboros
i love des tutorials http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=007VM8NZxkI&feature=related
the Resident Evil Virus is named after that concept.
Meanwhile: Normally I would look it up but I'm too damn lazy today ^_^
Assuming you can even buy it.
Which you cant.
With corruption, of course
And also the help of Discord :P
you might be able to buy Downing Street though
Ouroborus or Uroborus.
ive been to the white house, its surprisingly small
Mutterguy: Afraid thats already been bought by the banks.
No stream, right :P
twilight_sprinkle, some would call it cozy. :3
Yes.
Ninjazz: eh, too white
twilight_sprinkle: Raceist.
I lol'd.
nou Om
As much as awarding as a White House would be, I'm afraid of ghosts
Om: and you misspelled racist
*off
twilight_sprinkle: You misspelled Raceist.
OH OH OH!! Theres a new season of Yuri Yuri coming ^_^ YAY! I love that anime.
but not Basingstoke (ewwww)
Om: Touché
I need to watch and play Little Busters next time
/me cant do a fancy e :'(

Phase4: good cause right now i am using a i3
twilight_sprinkle: ^_^
Om: .v.
Phase4: and my mum has a i7 but she doesnt use it so my dads "Lending "it to me
What would be your preferred way of getting it?
twilight_sprinkle: .7.
DuskShine If I've learned anything from the military its "Always Volunteer"....wait, I think its the other way around :o
xD
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, if you're using an i3 the problem is most likley your graphics card
Om: c-c-c-combo breaker
Agreead
DuskShine Just PM me ^-^
twilight_sprinkle: Looks like a face to me.
Phase4: but that problem wouldnt exist as much if i had a i7?
Om: youve been drinking too much
Keep in mind its not finished :p
twilight_sprinkle: I don't drink, just naturally insane :)
And I'm back. Don't you hate it when you burp so hard you partially vomit into your throat.
Om: oh well thats good then!;)
lol!
I honestly love how Toku relates Miku with space on her songs :P

KABOOOOOM
twilight_sprinkle: I don't know if that face means the same thing to you, as it does to me.
FairysHuff: Don't you hate it when you read people and think TMI
Om, you too huh?
Phase4: try moving the flippy plate wings to the very front maybe?
Phase4: would it
Ninjazz: Eeeyup.
Om: Actually no. Never had that problem ^_^
00,02i have no clue how to make this fly
FairysHuff: lucky you.
Use railings
Phase4: it needs more torque when turning vertically
Om: hehehe ^_^
Railings makes it fly 20% better
Om, I've literally stopped using that because I feel like I'd give off the wrong signal now.
Om: prolly not O.o
Ninjazz: Yeah...
twilight_sprinkle: Its for the best.
less weight?
wooooo
What is this?
it flies!
barely
clearly it's fine!
doesnt have enough powah
Press x to not explode.
twilight_sprinkle: You would know >.>

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Phase4: ill take that as a maybe lol
00,02and then it stalled

and then write a HTML parser
Om: ive built an entire evil base with a freezer with body bags so i would
So no one wants a FREE copy of Magicka on steam then?
too much weight
I already have it
Don't know what that is.
lol
Om: It's a game.
BOOOM :D
hell
hello everypony
I could even write that in mIRC
hi LightTrooper105
Om: do you use steam?
FairysHuff: I have one.
FairysHuff, I already gots one. It. Is. Hard. o__o;
so much weight
Om: Steam or Magicka?
but no, I think I'll use python for this
Ninjazz: It's actually really easy once you learn the shield spells.
FairysHuff, which I didn't. :D
Phase4: You can rotate your wings with the q w e a s d keys
FairysHuff: Uhhhhh
Ninjazz: Just combine shield, ice or earth and cast on yourself

Ninjazz: I like to combine shield + ice + earth and use a life staff.
Ninjazz: The more of an element you use the more powerful it becomes
I like it when goblins go boom. :3c
00,02FairysHuff, dat magika
Ninjazz: Except in bed.
FairysHuff, really?
magicka is awesome
ohai Skylands
no way thatl work
I'm considering writing this fanfic downloader (for fanfiction.net) and then releasing it
So if I use more of fire on a simple... beam spell it will be more powerful?
Om: Well if you have steam add me on it and we'll know for sure. Same ID as here as on steam.
not for long at least
I prefer to use the elements of harmony
10Waking up at 6am ;-;
10Cool
Should I?
Wait, those aren't in magicka..
wtf

cus' I like open source but it means that ffn will change their format again
More bolts!
What is this?
FairysHuff: I have a steam, and I cant add people :I <---- free user
Phase4: Yeh.. sadly I made it too easy for myself by using that shield trick. ~_~ Completed it without much trouble.
Jim, that is WAY too OP, atm. They are fixing those.
Yay?
10If you want
Ninjazz: Yes.
I do
I get annoyed at authors who delete their fics ):
....PONIESSSSSS
Ninjazz: If you use more arcane in a beam spell it will last longer.
DuskShine

08,01Chrysalis: yes.
Cya colgate.
cya ColgatesHair
how can I connect to the Bronystate chat via XChat?
desktop ponies broke my computer .-.
08,01Chrysalis: so it turns out the problem i've been having with mysql permissions this morning is because for *some* stupid reason, one of the default privileges on install is to deny usage to all users
Lil_B: By hitting your comp with a BIIIIIG rock.
Wooo!
Lil_B you need to connect to irc.ponychat.net as a server and then #bronystate as the channel
so many ponies
FairysHuff doesn't work... wait.... nope, still doesn't work
OMG why the hell am I being so creative when I'm procrastinating?
deny all is a good idea to have as default in terms of security
thenaks Mutterguy

Lil_B: Maybe you just need a bigger rock. Or to hit it harder.

The rebels were onto something
STAY ON TARGEEEEET
lets see if phase has enough skill to land it

would be awesome
HiImSpike: with lasers PEW PEW PEW

LOL
they made it =DDD
Phase
Invi: wuuuuuut
aliens 1 planet 0
00,02the problem is thrust vectoring is the majority of my control
needs boosters on the wings
00,02makes landing hard
is Phase4 a wizard?
more fire
Midnight_Tempest: and i give you the finger
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: cool, i always wanted another one of those
put some weight on the front
Phase4 hard, but not impossibru?
that might help
gonna go boom
this wont end well
HAHAH
oh god

Phase4: love the ambition to achieve your goal :$
Phase
your missing rear gear
Need a celestia to kick us to the moon. Boosters are for suckers
lol
Phase4: shoot the x-wing proton torpedo down the mun garbage shute!
i'll get my congratulatory gifs ready Phase4
00,02wait a minute
i can hear the voices in that gif =/
00,02i figured something
... OK

Phase4: i daww at your sprite
:)
try putting thrusters in between the other thruster
pony is very determined to go to the moon killer
impossibru
nothing is impossibru
ofna01: i like how Phase4's OC sprite keeps sending up a mini rocket
I've got a bad feeling about this Scoob.
Phase
08,01well, i'm off to the music shop in a few minutes

Phase
did you pre-order this?
I am already confused by this conversation:D
08,01Phase4: nice, what in?
00,02kerbal space program
Darkts3 Thats not science, its logic :o
00,02allso some wheels have ended up on the wings
00,02no clue how
/) mechanics (\
I can't Handel all these puns
Phase4: Jedi Powers
genius engineer ^^
So what is actually going on here? streaming an x-wing model?
00,02oh nvm
08,01oh wow, so this is like a modern and less historically accurate version of Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space?
00,02i'ma launch
uhh
Are you sure you pulled them out of the wing section and not the landing struts one Phase4?
08,01please tell me someone has heard of that
00,02i think i have

with this aircraft?
Mehbeh
no
nah
he need rockets
lets bet on it
/me claps for Phase4's success
he needs more hyperdrive
10 bits
i vote he'll at least get out of the atmosphere

guy in the middle is lovin to die
middle guy is having fun
chutes too early
ofna01: he still wanted to kill everypony while going into space
Phase4: isnt that a space game?
well all his landings are going to be crash landings anyway
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, its a plane game too now
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, crash landings are easy
sploosh
lol Phase4
trapped in the ocean
without exploding Phase?
Phase4: is this game free and how big is the dl file?
yes is free,it took me 10 minutes to dl
00,02~300MB
00,02its free for the older version
00,02this one is paid
:P
...
00,02i puts the bigger engines on
00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, you want to strea>
Why am I not playing this game right now?...

also sloppy coding is sloppy
00,02i broke the landing gear

have not done python properly for ages so
Thats Phase4 in a nutshell xD
sloppppppy
00,02ah well
I enjoy making those

TO THE MOOOON
Phase is best Rocket builder =)
he's screwed
or not

phase
i have an idea
have a 4th engine for space in the middle of the other engines
bronystate ded?
:(
00,02ofna01, wouldnt have the fuel for it
/me rolls a dustball
couldnt you carry some extra fuel somewhere?
on the front maybe?
Hmm, how would a rocket made by Appature Science look like?
00,02Jim, probably this
it would have cake
lots of cake
00,02if i shifted the fuel into the center of the engines
00,02and used the cooling engine bodys instead of the ramjet ones
00,02this would work better
uhh
seems reasonable
I have no idea what your talking about
/) Science (\
/me flips Phase4 s ship thingy
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, it seems to handle flips just fine
lol Phase4
/me hands Phase4 a cookie
/me eats cookie

The world will end 31st of December 2099, because that's when the Windows calendar stops.
It'll be a little while before anything actually happens in my test, though. I have to reinstall Windows, despite the fact that the hard drive already has Windows installed on it XP

Excellent!
Pony Phase thinks Phase is ridiculous now XD
This shit should be on Top Gear

and an elevator
Space? Nah, we haz pod racerz
Om it is not gona get. it is already :D
That fin will be too tall
not gonna fly
screw gravity :[
with a lot of squinting I could almost see an AT-AT
No
just No
That's not going to fly
Wait a minute
Wow...I'm surprised.
FULL POWER PHASE
Mutterguy what? where?
is that a boat?
FULL POWER
This game knows more about Physics, than Half Life 2
wait, it it using the landing gear as wings? xD
FULL POWER PHASE!
FULL
Looks like a troop transport from Supcom2.
And that is saying something.
POWER
well if he keeps retracting the wheels it's walking
YEAH!
No!
Number of people who got the reference=Zero :D
not really, half life 2 is great, but this is a simulator, hl isnt
OH, I get it, it's a torpedo
so a simulator is supposed to have heavy physics base
TORPEDO AWAY!
Deployable from land
full throttle phase!
we must find atlantis!
man the things you can do with rocket fuel
00,02DAMNIT
00,02the engine disapeared
Well, looks like this rocket is made for land travel
boom
icwututriedtodothere
How about making a car?
no
tipping over XD
It's rolling over :D
we need moar space planes
Phase4: add it on the top 10, maybe then it wont
or just planes
*top
Do a berrel roll!
Like a dead guppy
wow why the hell did i write 10, im scared
twilight_sprinkle there is a Nerdcore Song by MC Hawkins and MC Frontalot with the Lyrics "I know more about Physics, than Half Life 2!" thats what I was refering too
its a space shuttle
yay
Lil_B: well i was mostly asnswering to Ninjazz :P
or an U-Boat
00,03I'll be bach~
:P
oh XD sorry, I did't catch that twilight_sprinkle

Cya trollhunter. Take care.
Cya Mutterguy. Take care.

bye all!
bye Mutterguy
take Ninjazz , cya care
bye Mutterguy
Waaah? D:
Phase4: not sure if you've seen the latest xkcd, but I've come to realize that he's waging an all-out war on the English Language, now.
Oh you, twilight_sprinkle. :3
cya trollhunter and Mutterguy
00,02XD
00,02Kandarihu, with reason
brb, taking a shower
Kandarihu it's totally 3
"a couple" is ALWAYS 2
Darn right
So when I say "I'll only have a couple of drinks"
add wheels until it reaches the moon
^
put two small wings and see if it will take off Phase4
00,02it wont take off
00,02way too heavy
Dont stoppppp believin!
moar engines
that will make it take off
its like a skate boot with rockets
Lol oh god
suddenly no wheels
XD
Disengage
lol
owwww
splat
the guy in the middle
lol
back to the drawing board
I think you need some secondary wheels for when the fuel compartments come off XD
Phase4 make as many thrusters as possible with as many fuel tanks as possible and look what happens xP
The guys in the middle gives no fucks
stop
engine gone
add the engine to the top
shuttle does not want to be a boat
yes!
engine on top!
After looking through the backlog, maybe "all-out war on the English language" might be premature.
y u not be boat
how to boat
take shuttle
put engines
???
PROFIT
how to motorboat
oh god
:P
Wrek!
ofna01: lovin <3 the idea

00,02this is not working
ofna01: apparently youve never taken college exams
When all else fails: C4
GOD DAMNIT PHASE
:D
00,02one more try
made me spit cola all over my screen!
It isn't? you mean the idea wasn't to hilariously explode?
Jim: which maths
00,02Meanwhile, its not unwelcome, just not the goal
Phase4: add the engine to the top if you want a boat
IM ON A BOAT
Hmm.
Full throttle
You need wheels.
You need wheels on your wheels.
phase,i have an idea
You need wheels, on your eyeballs!
lol
hello
yo dawg i herd you liek wheels
lol
*rides around on eyeballs*
hellyea.jpg
00,02THATS IT
00,02i'm bolting the front to everything else
Not sure what you call it over there, but we use geometric series, trigonometric equations, non-linear regression and differential equations to name some
Lmfao.
HHAHAAHA
That isn't supposed to happen
no offense but if this was in reality i would be '3'(\
A slight nudge, and there goes the cockpit.
Phase,stop your killing me
We just call it R2
Oh wow. That was spectacular.
i nearly choked on a chip
oh god
ofna01: Try harder.
Your chip needs wheels.
*puts wheels on chip
What game is this?
Jim: sounds easy, but weird that differential equations doesnt fit in that list
/me puts wheels on salsa
Kerbal Space Program Video
ok
free demo available at the site
chps x wheels. Make it happen
We also have integration, so it kinda fits
Phase has the right idea
MOAR ENGINES
This reminds me of spore
spore,but with rockets
likeaboss.jpg
More apples!
you cant eat all those apples
Jim: oh geometric series, i read that wrong. yeah so im guessing youre in college. i had my last calc exam a bit over a week ago
MOAR SPEED
That wasn't right.
LOL
But it WAS hilarious.
directed and made the game by himself I give you Micheal bay and his game of exploding space ships!!!
its like a drunk turtle
Michael Bay made this game
lol, twilight_sprinkle.
I HAVE AN IDEA
Hi, everybrony
hi CountDoofus
Allo CountDoofus.
EVERYONE PUT MIND HEIST ON
hoi CountDoofus
hello CountDoofus
ofna01: YASSIR
And then it falls in half or something.
Or a giant falcon picks it up.

/me attacks Sylandest with hugs
Allo Sylandest.

/me hugs Jim, Ninjazz, Meanwhile, Om, Invi
It's like a droid, picking up the cockpit

It looks like it's carrying an ice cream cone.
MY ICE CREAM
lol
nom icecream
Sylandest: You're awake!
Ocean. Ocean. Ocean! OCEAN!
Dat wombo combo kick
ofna01: It made it 50% cooler
I must go, the...sea, needs me.
johnny dont press the button... Ow crap
Om: eeyup! A few hours unconscious, and im back in action
WTF?
Dat spin.
No
Sylandest: Oh jes
we need a real plane!
Right after that crash, my desktop Pinkie Pie said, "I never felt joy like that before!"
XD
HA
yeah it obviously needs more landing gears
moar gears!
Wheels...on wheels.
WOW A SPACE BUS
this is eqivelent to game over... but to the little guys lifes over
Sylandest: There are no gears?
LOL
MOAR GEAR
Om: er...I meant wheels...XD
MOVE THIS GEAR UP
Everyone knows it needs more railings.
I'm drawing a blank as to what I should name my OC
it sucks
no Count
Deploying wheel railings, riiight here
Sylandest: Have something special in your cherious this mornin?
it needs more engines
MOAR ENGINES
Cross it!
Do eet!
Om: :O how did you know I was eating cheerios?
yes
do it
dont cross the wheels!
So let me get this straight.
/me crosses the streams
Wheels didn't work.
>:D
Sylandest: Don't look out your window O_O
So you think wheels on stilts might?
haha
Meanwhile: problem?
Cross the streams because that always ends well
Om: *looks out window* oh. my. god
twilight_sprinkle: Not really. This is going to be funny as hell to watch one way or the other.
/me waves
/me gives everyone chips and salsa!
hmm, these wheels Might be enough
EL QUESO!
/me waves back at Om, slightly terrified
this must be the cheapest airlines to man
woohoo

Your plane blew up so hard not even shrapnel was left.

It was atomised.
damn it, get our scientists back in here, we have another mystery
i cant

Sylandest: I sleep very poorly so I end up tired and sleeping all the time. Constantly toss and turn. Never fully asleep.
Lmfao

FairysHuff: oooh, that bites. I'm sorry to hear that
Jim: rofl
Om: Sadly as do I. I only ever feel awake at night.
twilight_sprinkle: perhaps we crossed too many wheels? :D
he crossed the streams
Sylandest: naaaah
FairysHuff: I only feel awake when I am awake :D
FairysHuff: sucks to read that
Sylandest: I wouldn't mind so much if I atleast had a little energy to do stuff.
twilight_sprinkle: moar wheels then!
So, crossing the streams is apparently a bad thing
Sylandest: on it!

In case of catastrophic failure of spacecraft resulting in the deaths of pilots, find new pilots and give the spacecraft stilts.
HiImSpike: Meh. Been like this since I was a child. Just the way my body works unfortunately.
....
ofna01: hey, you didnt take your shot.
needle shots
Pinkie's twitchin'
She knows what's gonna happen
Sylandest: Rarely and even then only toast and water.

Phase4: I am of the persuasion your rocket has a few bolts loose...XD
This spacecraft reminds me of those spiders
Why don't you add oars as well?
i have ponys on my screen
I was going to by lavendar oil and an oil burner. Apparently it helps with sleep. But the shipping cost for an oil burner is stupidly high.
00,02i cant figure why it sfalling abart
Spider plane?
*buy
Om: eeeyup
hmm needs more thrusters and landing gears
Om: fund it.
spider plane. spider plane. does whatever a spider plane does. can it swing from a web. no it cant, its a plane.
Phase4: You're sure it's not held on with PVA glue?
FairysHuff: just put some drops of lavendar oil on a wet cloth and hang it somewhere near your bed
Make them wings!
lol
GENIOUS
Wheel Wings!
nope

It started suspended off theground. Then it fell
Just put an engine on the back and see if it flies.

AKA the Torpedo
FairysHuff: evaporation. if you use a wet cloth, the water evaporates. but it also spreads the scent of the oil
brb
need an engine and some wings
then it is space worthy
that's what i do with mint oil, when i've got a cold
mint oil?
:O
lovin the design
<3<3<3
looks like a fighter jet
<3
somepony_else: Hmm I hadn't thought of that. Though that would only work during the summer. It wouldn't evaporate at any other time during the year. I live in Scotland. Very cold.

08,01BLASPHEMY!

08,01FairysHuff: what about my kinetic flatulance?
I put sugar in my tea :$
that looks like it could actually fly
I'm such a rebel
anyone else think so?
If that works, then hopefully I'll be good for a while.
08,01Meanwhile: the kind of gimboid who doesn't take sugar in their tea, apparently

I tried honey in my tea once. Before I knew it, I was out of honey.

AWESOME!
I'm still trying to comprehend tea without sugar.
lol Jim
ITS AN F-12!
F-14*
I have a dream that one day, the mares and stallions of this world will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all ponies are created equal.
oh my lord its working
ITs working!
Kammerjunk: nice dream
LOL
NAHT!
not in the Water!
oop, never mind
Kammerjunk, only some... are more equal than others.
Sylandest: Look what you did.
what happened?
I don't know, it gets kind of annoying after a while.
Just a quick reminder for any Scottish bronies. I'm still interested in setting up a bi-weekly D&D game. ^_^ Let me know if your interested.
It just collapsed upon itself
i was in a different tab
Om: Who else but me though? :D
and thats bi-weekly, not bi-sexual. Just being clear
Phase4: i have a challenge for you
FairysHuff: lol
Sylandest: Hmmm. Hoover?
make a flying F-14 or a flying F-22
00,02ofna01, i'm listening
Om: hmm...touche'
Hi everypony :$
00,02hmmmm
FairysHuff: what about bi-winning
FairysHuff: I don't even know what "bi-sexual D&D game" means anyway.
hi Irish_Pony
Jim: Can never to too careful. ^_^ People may get the wrong idea.
FairysHuff: As if one might confuse the word weekly with the word sexual.
F-14 should be easy to make
hiiiii irish
Hi Irish_Pony
hey Irish_Pony
Meanwhile: He. He. Yeah... That'd be stupid.
I blame every failure to these People --->
Mornin, Irish.
Kammerjunk: -_^

nothing but explosions
Phase4: gewd 4 u
00,02the f-22 will look nothing like an f-22
00,02but i could do it
Wait... can we somehow establish somekind of "Phase4 Failure" Meme?
Phase
00,02XD
00,02ofna01, yeah?
here is a good picture of an F-14
ofna01: I bega reading that and thought it was going to say "Search for bi-sexual D&D" ^_^ lol

Yeah, this is going to work.
What can possibly go wrong?
Nothing will go wrong, nope, not at all!
Are they duct taping these things together?
Oh yeah. That looked safe.
Duct tape fixes everything. Even spacecrafts.
Funny, shuttle repair kits actually contain duct tape.
What's can possibly go wrong?
Meanwhile nope, Lego-Stacking
The solution to everyone's problems!
VenHur96: you just had to say it...XD
Oh duct tape, is there anything you can't do?
Well, it could explode.
And Sylandest, overlook the fact that I already said it why don't you. :P
VenHur96: That's just as bad as saying "It can't get any worse."
Can you make a Duct-tape Soup?
No... It will explode
00,02looks nothing like it
Nope :D
Meanwhile: oh, my bad! sorry! :$ I didnt see it
well, I think i have to say goodbey now
Pfft, I was only joking Sylandest. It's all good.
Wait a minute... The BronyState site pony-Phase4 is checking out is mirrored.

RaveBrony: You don't need Photoshop
00,02diddutz, its something else
RaveBrony: GIMP is good enough
Lil_B what did you do about it?
RainBowJack: That sounds more like a problem with your graphics than steam, are your drivers updated?
Jim: its why cracks exist :D
Vordox: Does it have the same features as the tutorial on desktopponies?
its sinds the last update that steam does that so you can be
listening to balloon party
XD
RainBowJack my problem was entirely different from yours, so it wont help you. Steam didn't want to connect to the internet, and i fixed it by turning of my Proxy-Server in IE
00,10are you tryng to add lift boosters?
i prefer onlive... no worries about graphics cards.
00,10turn off snap to angles
I dont know how to work art programs.... let alone, animations.... so without a tutorial on how to make ponies.... Id be completely lost
RaveBrony: GIMP has all you need to make anythig sprite related
00,10or that
RaveBrony: Animation? Just do a sprite sheet
ima go now... gotta love biology exam
:S
They should call this game "Michael Bay simulator" :D
Vordox: See? I have no clue what that is :D
Give a "field" of how much you want your sprite to be in size, usually make sure it's 55+ x55+
00,10oh god arrow jets?
Phase4: Building a harrier
00,10no good will come of that
lol
see you all later
Vordox, can you teach me how to use gimp someday? Every time I look at it I have 0-clue what to do, everything I try messes something up
RaveBrony: BASICALLY, make a sprite sheet...Let me show you ONE of the things I did
Bye rdibp
I don't use GIMP, I use PSP
Bye rdibp
00,02its spawning with a detached cockpit
First i have to get GIMP :D
wut? Why?
05sumica

05Sumica: beatign act 4

/me hugs Wrek also
00,10ohhhhhh, no
05MadSurge: wut
Lol :D
hi VioletGreySha ;) and this time i really ment you XD
00,10just took down the seagebreaker with friend last night on eu
lol
RaveBrony: This is an example of a sprite sheet I found by the one who made Wrek's. http://img833.imageshack.us/img833/7268/feedback4.png
Wrek: second boss in Lollipop Chainsaw is an undead metal viking :D
Lil_B: well there is none else with violet sow hay :3
I need a nap -_-
Om, I was just about to head to bed as well.
Vordox: You have to create...every...single....layer of movement!?! O_O
This cannot possible fail.
Well...Depends
Om and Ninjazz: to bed with both of you ponies XD
00,10Nice fuel air bomb you made Phase4
Ninjazz: lol no I am on your time schedual?
aw crap
00,02Sumica, ikr
Boom.
It's the early version of the flying ship from Avengers
Sylandest1: I just might for a few hours
SPLASH
00,02that time allmost worked
00,10why not parachutes?
Om, nah. I'm just trying to keep in good health for while.
Why not stilts?
Om: go for it, hehe. Good sleep helps to keep one happy and going
Stilts are best wheels
RaveBrony: It's not as hard as you think it is
I had food for breakfast!
00,02cause i didnt think of them
00,02they might work better
RaveBrony: Just do like...pose to pose...
Ninjazz: Fair enough. In case I fall asleep and you leave, goodnight xD
Dat flip
OWWW
FUUUUU
...Wut?
MY KNEEEEE
00,10nose heavy
moar rear weight
ofna01: You ok, man?
Dat rear weight.
RaveBrony: Like neutral here, then copy and paste the old one, move the stuff where you want them, basically, change the pose.
Om, and to you too, good sir! :D
Then do inbetweens to make it smooth
think i hurt my knee
I just cried my fucking ass off, and it felt great
it hurts whenever i move it
so you lost your ass?
I used to an Rocket like you, Until i took a Phase4 to the Fuel Tank
Vordox: Alright, ill see what happens when GIMP is done downloading :P
Jim yea xD
RaveBrony: I'll go through some basics, if you want.
Vordox: LEt me get it and then play with it, then ill ask questions :$
;_;
Like, where is the sprite sheet maker thing?
RaveBrony: Alright, but I recommend you edit stuff first, to see the differences.
thats it, cant study anymore. if I fail I fail, dont even care...
lol
KA-BOOOOOOOM
XD
Did they died?
Alchemist: don't say that
I just have to say it right now, I fucking love all of you guys
Alchemist Thats the Spirit!

BroKnee: me too
/me hugs Bro
Aww you, BroKnee.
/me hugs BroKnee
Well done BroKnee everyone is blushing now XD
Alchemist: Aw come on, dont say that D: what are you studying?
we wub you too, BroKnee
Lil_B As long as you all know that I love you

RaveBrony: Ah, found the creator of Phase4's pony, and his sprite sheet.... http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/4363/feedrearview.png O.o
Once upon time there was a shuttle. And it was so ugly that everyone exploded. The end.
Well I'm off now
Vordox: That looks like alot of work o_o but i guess it has to be done, lol
oww
RaveBrony: Dunno, ask the artist.
i think im going to cry from pain tbh
Who is that?
RaveBrony: matter science: nanotechnology, nanoparticles, ceramics, composites, biocompatible stuff etc
think i hurt a bone or something in my nee
05MadSurge: oooh i see
Alchemist: Oooo, fun stuff :o
RaveBrony: Dunno, got it through personal means. XD
Oh :D
i think i cracked my kneecap
Anyway, back to focus on College.
o__O
ow?
brb

00,10sound painful
ouch
I used to be an ofna01 like you?

Wrek: All bosses are a stereotype of a music genre :D
Dang...that's..hurts like heck.
It works!
brb gonna get an icepack
O_O
No wait
00,10woops
hope i can hop all the way
lol
<--- this is fun to watch. what is it?
Phase4 should not fly a spacecraft...
Agreed.,
that was a EPIC fail moment Phase4
00,02^ Vordox
00,10you could try detaching the vtol
Agreed, bro.
Or you could try more wheels.
Phase4: It's kinda quiet, got any playlist? =3
Vordox nor should he design one XD
00,02Sumica, that assumes i'm not tired
im back
MORE WHEELS!
00,02and thinking straight
Lil_B: Designin is fine
RaveBrony: it would be but the ppt I have to study from only have a few bulletpoints and dont explain anything. Its quite hard to learn what quantum entrapment/confinement means all by yourself...
*losing horns*
i keep thinking the engines startin up are sirens
lol
Toasty.
LOL
Toasty!
They looked happy before the explosion
haha
poor Phase4 OC his Roket gets blown up everytime
the Jury sais 8/10 for the Backflip

RaveBrony: thats why I said I had it for today...

RainBowJack: this does not only happen to his OC
00,10damn symitry keeps turning off.
Alchemist: yeah, thats tough :\
hey bros, what r we watchin

I think the Kerbals dumped more money into their Space Program than NASA
Lil
00,10the space program is all they have
i think they spent 99% of that on Beer
<---- This guy's spending billions and billions of government dollars trying to get this thing to fly.
00,10not the lack of citys
00,10note*
so, Kerbals just want to get away from their planet
DAMN
Because it's a dump
Phase4: fly the G-14
:O
00,02good idea
Sumica their Civilisation is all underground... I guess because they are all gangsters
Fly the G3.6
Lil_B: Or hipsters
Jim: Well, look at it. Judging by this game the only thing on the planet is a rocket design and launching station.
AHAHAHAHA

Phase4: i hope you fixed the G-14
HAHAa
00,10nah it's all under ground due to falling exploding wreckage

Sumica do you have some SwatCats epis?

So Im guessing Sumi is streaming?
CCCP! :D
I guess so
Everlasting_Joy: heres the beginning http://www.mangahere.com/manga/yu_gi_oh/v01/c001/
Sumica: You know what that needs?
Looks like the kerbals decoupled from the rest of the ship, which landed on top of them.
Everlasting_Joy: best part. ITS NOT ABOUT A FUCKING CARD GAME
ACS13123: yes he is
00,10more power
yay
:)
a solid engine? i see bad things happen
Bronysith: But. . . It's card games. . . Some of them on motercycles.
Everlasting_Joy: Grab issue one of Shonen Jump USA... or volume 1 of the manga
Everlasting_Joy: its actually about shadow games. not just card games
Oh, the original Yu-Gi-Oh? Yeah. It wasn't about card games in the beginnnig.
It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-oh wait not yet?

Hello CCCP~
Bronysith: Oh. . .

Bronysith: tsk tsk, that isn't legal
/me hugs Nyria
mitamaking: SCREW THE RULES I HAVE PONIES
Bronysith: we all do :)
/me rolls eyes at overused joke
00,10this can only end well
How's stuff CCCP?
Needs more stilts.
SCREW THE RULES I HAVE GREEN HAIR
MadSurge: okay
Bronysith: I couldn't get past that first page without laughing.
mitamaking: how is that overused? i said ponies not money
Everlasting_Joy: i know right
Imagine our real space-vehicles would be this ugly
Bronysith: It's not funny, it's a joke from 5 years ago
mitamaking: if you dont like it. idc i love it
Symmetry is best something...
Here are your options. 1(fuck all, im discord)
btw what are the movies for bmn? i missed the intermission and theres still nothing on front page
00,10messed up the stageing
What the fuck?
This was... so useless
wait
Sumica: Those poor piolets. . . Oh well, clone some more.
hmm
Bronysith: I am just disappointed in the last few episodes Littlekuriboh has done, they have lost some humor, DBZ:A has picked up the slack though
lol
00,10they are like seamonkies
To the briny depths with them!
my plane exceeded the G-Forces it could take and snapped in half
:D

mitamaking: thats no reason to hate little kuriboh. besides. HE WORKS ON TFS
oh no
Is it even possible with a plane-like thing
00,10oh ffs
Bronysith: when did I say I hate him, I do think he is funny, but his last few episodes are not up to his normal quality
00,10SAS is out to kill them
Sumi
that looks sorta like an A-10
MMM watcha saaaayyyy
And the screw the rules joke is way overused
mitamaking: considering he travels alot. going to conventions and all. and also working with tfs. its understandable
~
mitamaking: not as overused as lame ass skyrim
holy crap sumi
Bronysith: If he did more than one episode a year I would agree
you had no chnce to recover on tht
Listening to Lacrimosa while watchign the stream makes it about a thousand times more epic.
00,10keep giting rolled
I thought I'd never see a plane do a triple side back flip before~
And I am meeting him at otakon anyway

VDXRetrotainment: hahahahahaha /)
I CAN DO BETTER

Nyria too bad. You should be in bed, you shouldn't be up this late
Om, oh believe me... It's bad.

Dat woah.
DashWithRainbows: Egh~ What if I told you I am in my bed and I'm on a laptop?~
Bandai. Really.
LoyalDash, either magic or damn good logic. I'm choosing the first choice.
Nyria...close enough.
Panda: The name of this anime is Tiger and Bunny. Its 6 kinds of awesome.
Ninjazz: jazzy music is magic, but it wont wake me up :)
xD
/me shrugs~
Ninjazz: That sounds kind of reasonable.:D
