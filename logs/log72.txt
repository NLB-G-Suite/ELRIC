11The weather started getting rough, The mighty ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew, The serpent would be lost....the serpent would be lost. The ship set ground on a random shore To be stuck there quite a while, The ponies left stuck to run amuck, Right on Equestria Isle.
11No dresses and no parties, Not a single apple tree, Like Robincolt Crusoe, As primative as can be. So tune in to this story, friends, You're sure to get a smile, From seven stranded castways, Here on Equestria Isle.

Mod training = throwing you in the lake to teach you how to swim.
That's how it's done right!
11no, they were stupid because they gave the opponent ample opportunity to kill them.
lol
How did they?
Here's a banstick. Use it.
but...but...I know how to swim:(
....
11In the woods.
They had a policeman with them.
I think Monty Python was the night I first Joined, but I joined and the movie was done.
11Who turned on them.
Would you assume he's one of the cannibals too outright?
wat
lol moar torchwood plz?
wat
11No, but if he's turning on them, then he's not a fucking cop, imo
silverscreen: so?
THAT WAS THE BEST DAY EVER
He turned on them, then he would have killed Owen.
If they tried anything.
You almost never see people shoot in films in situations like that.
silverscreen: what night was Monty Python?
One side always puts their guns down.
It's not stupid, that's just the way people always do it.

13he complained about a wireless mouse because it took a fraction too long to respond to his movements when playing a PC game, so he ditched it and bought a wired one =w=

03LOL
03well
03I wouldn't mind wired mice if my desk wasn't so big
They do RHCP in one of the other 4 Chord song variation
11wait...they seriously just tried to say that musicians don't take too much effort to do what they do?!
eeyup.
11LOAD. OF. FUCKING. SHIT.
/me shrugs.
/me 11shuts up before he goes full rage.
Lol.l
Much nicer way to put it is anyone can be a pop star with those four chords
They are shitting over musical wonders like Miracle of Sound.
TORCHWOOD BITCHES
I can see why they'd say that given what passes for "musician" these days.
LETS KILL SOME FUKKEN ALIENS
but
ACTUAL musicians but a load of effort into it
They're kind of poking fun at their own idea, actually
11But those four chords aren't even heard in half of the songs they mentioned.
1812?
Angry sex incoming?
11It's just coincidence that they match.
ValtheJean: look miracle of sound up on youtube. And tell me with a straight face that this isn't a good musician.
At this time Canada is burning down the White House for lulz
is this the wood thing?
After this episode it puts us half way through the series.
Well, more than half way I suppose.
@Dermathil never heard it...but I wasn't targeting a specific artist
12Wow, that's really good Umbreon lol
FUKKEN ALIENS!
valthejean: he's a modern musician who actually is so good he got picked up by the Escapist to make songs every two week about video games.
03god dang it
03stupid video got blocked
And they are above-par.
12I'm not sure if even I can make decks like that
IMO.

what you say when you "tag" someone with the blade
12what you are doing most of the time is drawing a ton of cards
From fencing, touché is when you touch your opponent with the tip

03Yep
that's how a lot of my trip went, outside of meeting family members and visiting monuments and stuff
03there's nothing to do outside
I'd just crash on the bed/laptop and be lazy and not go outside
03meeting more than family members *cough*
where it's like 96 with humidity
03but yes, being lazy is what makes the world go round
13Plus it wasn't as hot indoors

yep, drf

13we walked past several large cactuses and she pointed at one and said "what the hell is that?"
mexican standoff incoming, again.
suddenly day
yay!
suddenly morning you mean.
wtf
Hmm?
03I swear
13all I said was "...it's a cactus, mum"
03I will never get femal+es
13she sounded so surprised though LOL
03and I don't mean that like "i will never get a girl"
03but as in, never understand
/me goes to take a screenshot
bring her to california, and she'll be swimming in cactuses :P
damn
Nice.
13I don't understand many females either :B
heck she'll figure out the spanish word for it in about two seconds XD
The shelf in the room...

03anyway see

03I'm lookinag at that
03going o_O
03those are my two sisters if yo ucan't tell by the name
03but I mean what
12Their minds are even worse
03arguing over something that doesn't exist
03is like
03what
LOL
13LOL wut xD
03I know right
THERE'S SOMETHING MOVING IN THE DARK, AND ITS COMING, JACK HARKNESS. AND ITS COMING FOR YOU!
ARGLEBARGLE
(I remember the meaning of that line oh so well.)
12nomnomonomonomoono onommomo
:P
I'm up too late.
the foreshadowing...
Eeyup.
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 5 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
12LOL there's "moo" there
@pony Pony in the darkness coming for Jack Harkness
6 Pony in the darkness coming for Jack Harkness is 6Spik3e
lol wut
13I find it funny when girls ask you whether they look better in one outfit or another, but they look terrible in both
That incoming ep dealing with that foreshadowing was pants-on-head-retarded levels of awesome.
but you have to say they look good anyway
what episode is that?
or be honest and lose a friendship XD
series 1 finale
12I don't, if my friends ask me what I think I tell them straight =P
haven't seen it yet
03^
Oh God.
03People already hate me
O_O
Guess I have stuff to look forward to
03so I'm like
wat
03w/e
INB4 Jack shagging everything that moves.
03granted I don't just go around calling people ugly
I misread that
03but if they ask
13I just agree with whatever they say so they'll shut up and just buy the damn thing :B
o_o
03then I'll be like
^^
03yes, you are
/me runs
12LOL
lol
LOL
Dat foreshadowing
03and even when I go "shopping", it's like to Target, or somewhere like Micro Center or Worst Buy
I remember that one too.
hehehe
I view shopping as a solo experience honestly
I wonder if what happened in the pony story "The Room" has actually happened before?
03or maybe GameStop if I'm really that bored
03I view shopping as going to www.amazon.com and clicking around
I don't want to brodcast what I'm buying to another person other than the cashier
thats prolly just me
03because LOL, paying too much for stuff
I REMEMBER THAT EPISODE
12If I go out of the house to shop, it's either to dvd,game,anime or manga shops
13I just don't go shopping
03people always ask how I buy such nice things
THE WHOLE STORY OF THE ALIEN EYE
03i'm like "it's because unlike you, I don't go to malls"
HAHAHAHA
I remember that one too. XD
That episode is gonna be brilliant.
03LOL I don't go shopping either, unless I'm bored, looking around computer stores is always fun
We just finished episode 8 of 13.

But this is a mass of different races, cultures, groups, and minds
I myself think the idea of the show is good and should be spread. We need love and tolerance these days.
^
This is EXACTLY what I think
What BAD can come of FRIENDSHIP and TOLERANCE!?
Nothing.
but ultimately it's a lot like drawball, people will plan raids to show their support for FiM, and do something cool with it. I think getting mentioned on the Colbert Report is a pretty cool thing, so.

dari wants a pony shirt
I must check Notch's blog

Heh, I might try a remake in pony style
it's representing a brony forum I'm on
kind of a forum
You're on a brony forum? :o
I dunno how else to explain it
but yeah, endermen... if you look at them, they'll slowly turn towards you... and the moment you look away, they'll sprint at you fast as fuck.

Gnight
But unfortunately little girls don't apparently.
plushies that actually look good too
So we are unlike to get more for a long time.

a Spike plushy would be the awesome
I saw a twilight plushie that I'm pretty sure goes with the new bed set, it looks kind of cute I guess. lemme get a pic
night denied
I have been looking for the throw blanket everywhere but to no use
I went to one target yesterday and another one this evening

O.o
Rainbow Crash always crashes in style~
ok back

so for this other band I've been filming for, their manager said that they might be able to work something out to have me intern for the next video they make
just now she asked me to mail some speaking sequences
not sure what for but either way hgurdighrihgrid
:D
Nice!
about getting the internship
yeahhh I'm hoping so at least
that'd be so cool
as for the speaking sequences though, I wonder what those would be for
maybe they're going to use it in a live video or something
if they do I don't mind :P
oh, maybe
brb again
ok back once more
wb again
I won't be on much longer though
I'm getting pretty tired
D:
hey dari, how long did it take you to make your challenge?
a little while longer though
I've been trying to make a comic, and I want to finish one more panel
oh cool
I like the way it's turning out so far
what's it about
pretty much the nerdiest thing ever
dari?
:P
so there's this game coming out where you can be pretty much any kind of character you could possibly want to be
so I'm making a comic about my character's backstory
because I'm so excited for the game
lol that's cool
he's gone :O
bring out the dogs
we have to find him
thanks
Organize a search party.
Who all is still here?
hmm, nobody.

03....
03I'm kinda scared
12?
03I was eating popcorn and literally started tasting metal
03and guess what
03my filling
03fell out
03x.x
03there's literally now a hole in my tooth
03I didn't even think fillings could fall out like that
12yeah.... i think you should have that checked at
03I will be
so either the filling was falling out in the first place, or the tooth is rotting inside out
03I already told my mom to schedule an appointgment with the dentist
03-g
03hm
03well
03you know how I said it hurt?
03it doesn't hurt now
causing it to fall out
yeh
03the hole
hmm
that might be it then
03but what I don't get is
03How can a filling hurt?
12was probably a really bad filling
03It's not part of your tooth at all
12done by someone who went to dental school for like 2 hours
03LOL
03dude
03my dentist has been a dentist for years
03I trust him :|
03maybe it was just because he was pressed for time LOL
it might have been incorrectly rubbing against your tooth
12even the professionals make mistakes from time to time
03hm
03well
03the dentist has no openings this week so I have to wait til next week I think... is it...bad to have a hole in my tooth like that?
03or should i be fine?
12well
12there is a reason we get those holes filled in
07just avoid getting food stuck in it
03OK
03well
12yeah
03it's like the very far right tooth
12no steak for you
03I can't really reach it iwth a toothbrush even
03so I shouldn't have to worry
07and it hurts because the hole often goes through to the nerves
03well
03how come it no longer hurts now that the filling fell out?
/me shrugs
03:/
03anyway see
03here's the weird thijng
03after that filling fell out
03I got all the food out of my mouth and stuff
12maybe there was some sort of pressure inside the tooth
03but then when I went to keep eating, I still tasted metal
03so I dunno if it maybe just didn't all come out at once
12that would of course cause pain and the pressure finally released itself when the filling fell out
03or if somethingelse is going on :/
03pressure inside the tooth? is that normal?
03I've never had cavities before like a month ago so I really dunno about this stuff
12i'm not a dentist
03I know
03but you have more experience with fillings than I do LOL
07that's because metal fillings have tiny amounts of mercury
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOtMizMQ6oM
[1,0You0,4Tube]: Little Shop of Horrors - Dentist Song | by keithy47 | Length: | Views: 2 030 594
12you are better off asking this guy
03...isn't mercury toxic?
12yes
03frick LOL
03if I die
03then goodbye
03XD
07if it comes loose, the stuff sealed under would rub off easy
07and it isn't in that amount
12yeah
03wait, so what are you saying? That it would have not all fell out in one piecde?
03-d
12fish has mercury
fillings are made using silver and mercury
03LOL
03I should totally ask for 24 karat gold :D
/me hides
/me learned this from a CSI episode
03XD
03well
03I know some gangsters and whatnot get gold fillings instead of silver
07no, it's just that the mercury in the fillings will rub off from the silver easily
07and lol
03so that would explain why I kept tasting metal even though I thought I got it lal out?
03*all
07that wasn't a gangster thing
03I'm just scared to eat now
03because chewing metal is like, really bad
07that was what they used for fillings way before silver
03LOL really
03someone go tell Paul Wall then that he's out of date
07in the foot-powered drills era lol
07and does that guy really have a gold filling, or is it just a gold tooth
07or a grill
07XD
03well the song is called Grillz so...
03anyway Kyu once I brush my teeth and maybe use some mouthwash to rince my mouth out, I should be fine to eat like normal?

did I get Gameboid from you for my phone?
or did I somehow get that on my own
I can't remember
03not sure
03is it Gameboid Lite or the full one?
07lol
07speaking of popcorn I was just afk to make some
lite I think...
07and yes you'll be fine, just avoid chewing with that tooth
03OK
03and if it's Lite, you got it on your own
03as that one's free
03actually
03they're all free now XD
03but
03they all got removed from the official Android market for some copyright crap
03so you have to get the SlideME marketplace app, they're all on there for free
12night all~
03Gah
03TST forums got screwed up again
03it's saying I have an art gallery, and all the pictures in there are done by someone else
03I remember this problem happening before, I don't know what's causing it but it's happening again o.o
03also Aurora
03one of the best things I've seen on dA in ages
03top left mainly
lololololololol
03yeah I was looking on facebook and there's actually a whole Aperture Science group
03with a cave Johnson and Chell, etc etc
doesnt surprise
03and it said Chell was "in a relationship with Companion Cube"
03they used that as their avatar
03I was like O_O
03so I did a google image search and found that XD
03(if you didn't know, you can now give google an image and it'll match it)
lol
03but yeah, any idea wtf is happ9ening with the gallery
03?
03http://www.lugia.us/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=lastupby&uid=7
03that's what it links to
03those are not mine
that's been happening for months
we pointed that out back in december
i have NO idea what's going on there..
03I thought someone fixed it
03let me put it this way
03until tonight I have never had a "View my gallery" thing on the side of my posts
03or possibly when the forum was redesigned, I didn't l;ook
I think everyone has one now
03LOL
03I don't have a gallery though :|
03and gah, is there a way to edit/use that new "Favorite Pokémon" thing? I wanted to add something but can't find where
same
03LOL
03OK the
03n

ohai Dman
ohay barry? more like Ohai Dermathi!
Hey
hahahahahah
Xeli
I found my old PO teams
they were in my USB
Dermathil *
btw Dman. I sent my modship application form in.
How did it go?
Yup
then he collapsed due to sleep or seomthing xP
leaving stream on
so what's on the form?
oh, nothing yet. I just filled the form in. The interview didn't take place yet.
oh rite. but you filled a form in?
yeah
the form felt I was in a pretty good position.
excellent!
(seeing I joined at the movie night #2)
(nice one bro. I joined at movie night 3, but eh i've been to erry night since including saturdays)
Bronystate is just awesome
yeah
what exactly is the form? like, name and stuff?
Yush
Wifi works
nah, you just fill in 8 questions like "you got any modding experience prior to this? Since when did you join? any experience with IRC before?" etcetera
oh i see.
So what are you up to?
updating my ipod.
=D
going through a whole lot of shit ton of syncing
that reminds me, mine's about to run outta battery, I should charge it soon
looking at pony pictures
yay~
i haven't played story of the blanks yet...i'll wait till it's night time and play it :PP

Ah i know this song

eh. It is way older than that.
iknow
i did youtube it and read about it on wiki ^_^ resourceful brony is resourceful
I know it from the old game Battlefield vietnam.
Skylands should be on soon I think
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"

I keep seeing this on youtube:

seeing what?
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
ＳＨＵＴ　ＵＰ　ＡＮＤ　ＥＮＪＯＹ　ＴＨＥ　ＭＵＳＩＣ！
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
That
ah
10Extremely coincidental lol
on youtube comments i mean
10As I never wake up this early
xDD
ohai Sky
that's prolly because of the hippy age of the music
10But since there's a loud thunderstorm :P
: /
How did you do that?
10hey Dusky
most modernsoncs are just repetitive and awful
Barry - copy paste?
from what i saw on youtube
hmm
Although Barry - there's a neat program called 'tenclips#
you cycle through 10 clips with CTRL adn 1 - 0
and you have TEN available clips
so you can have 10 things copied
and paste any given one
so on my 1st clip i have 1▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ and on my second clip I have ＳＨＵＴ　ＵＰ　ＡＮＤ　ＥＮＪＯＹ　ＴＨＥ　ＭＵＳＩＣ！
so i press CTRL 1 CTRL V then CTRL 2 CTRL V
faster than selecting and copying the second part
^_^
it's pretty neat =]
/me listens to Gimme Shelter by the rolling stones.
Dman, what do you think of this?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ7uUjJF_L4&feature=related
yaya wesome song!
ok i'll view that barry
Hmm...i've heard this before somewhere
an anime intro? an intro? a pony fan intro?
Maybe not in that language
It was originally Japanese
yes, i see on wiki this has a japanese
lol
quote : "resourceful brony is resourceful"
=]
so has this been used in an anime or some show?
i've heard it before somewhere
Naruto: Shippuden opening 4
Closer
I KNEW IT
Naruto is my no.1 anime
i watch it weekly :3
cool!
so do I
you to?
YAY
too *
God damned fraking train broke down today on my way to work
so so so
yep
i loved seeing gai and kakashi again!
I'm waiting for Japanese episode 213
(theyr rivalry i mean)
And the train company still has the cheek to ask for fare increases
I dropped naruto when I saw they made fillers again in shippuden.
223*
of course! we all are bro
Dermathil - ;__;
dun' worry.
.-.
barry what's up with recent eps?
two week gap then double episode then two week gap?
I had a website that basically linked every single episode.
No, it's an episode a week
i download now. to see in 720 p ^_^
Skylands
Want to go against my terrorist team?
barry - recently
I finally found it
And the animators got smarter with fillers
there was a double
instead of doing an 83 episode filler run
and yes fillers are now win!
10Sure
july 28th - 'storage' and 'the five kage's desicion'
They split them off between arcs when the anime gets closer to the manga than is safe
double ep
:D
suddenly, bronystate email
Tmorrow should be a new episode
and a new manga chapter
Yush! but i don't read the manga
no spoilers please >_<
right
have you seen the lost tower?
Yep
i swear i swear the 4th hokage guy naruto's father worked it it was his son!
worked out *
but they all memory wipe ;__;
There's a particular scene in the manga that I'm not sure will get a pass into the anime
is it spoilers?
if not what is it?
and why not? gory? too much?
It's after Naruto and Bee enter Cloud
enter cloud?
so um not happened in anime yet
Yeah
but close
might be a couple weeks
is it spoilerific or would i be alright reading it to see why not?
It's not spoilerific
'you will meet an octopus' why hasn't anyone worked it out in the hsow
ok um do you have a link to it? I wanna see why it 'wouldn't pass into the anime'
Alright.
Thanks
also up to where the anime is i mean, any major differences in manga and anime / missed out stuff?
I'd LOVE to know
only thing i know is that 'tales of a gutsy ninja' is a different ninja every time
oh and best bit so far is when naruto says 'give up on me giving up' with the rasengan near the end of saving konoha
with the 'heavenly ... somehting' song
Anyone has the misfortune of having a train break down on your way TO work?
http://www.mangafox.com/manga/naruto/v54/c513/15.html This is the scene I'm not sure will be put in as is
how come? well i'll read it
You'll see
ok
has it been mirrored or do I read it right to left?
read right to left

guys, I got an Idea. I am putting the movie "The Game" on top of my B-movie selection list.
Oh?
trololo, and that, but is it good?
mfw google says there's 4 films called 'the game'
could be seen as a trolololol while being a real movie. It is interesting and slightly mind-screw, but not in the way you intend it to be.
and 3 tv shows
Which one?
the 1997 movie the game.
Ok gotcha
with michael douglas and Sean Penn
is that the one with a tv in a house?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBiMo5JvUqA&feature=player_embedded
Best. Card trick. EVER.
also very VERY recent
wow.
dman: there's more than just a tv in a house.
dermathil - i've seen the first 10 odd minutes.. it looked good :P
IS it good?
yes
it is a good thriller.
sounds like a good b movie pick then!
yeah
i still don[t know what i'd pick
(especially because of the name)
(trololo)
yeah
(have you seen the magic trick?)
watching it now
and it is hilarious
It is! :P
and it is a pretty good trick.
shows why he's the best card magister.
How does he do it! >_<
Eyup
(he paid the guys at the factory to make another deck like that)
(dat signature)
eeyup
but that's possible :P
he did seem to put a card into the 'new deck' at some point
but putting it in right order?
he forgot he signed another 7 of diamond two weeks ago
and dat seal
hahaha
i love magic, but can't do any myself
same
I usually like it to try to find the trick behind it.

future that is Dman

10Ah

/facepalm
13Someone remind me how to ghost my other nick? :<
So he's next to me, spams, I say 'rules are no spam' so he highlights the SENT MESSAGE and hits BACKSPACE, thus leaving the page.
Skylands, they never took the bracket off
Oh dear, most spanish folk are suck technophobes :P

13Thanks :3
the big metal thing that holds the wire
very end tooth
10Metal on both sides o.o
yes
10I don't think I had that
my mouth was that messed up LOL
I had "intensive" braces
10Just wires along the front side
I still can't smile x.x
inb4 why so serious
10Nah
10Do you wear a retainer?
Dman,i don't know about Falco being an asshole in Starfox 64,but i trust you.
not anymore LOL
I'm supposed to but pssh
hahaha
I love my n64 :3, and he was portrayed
well
10I meant the ones that are permanent for a while :P
he was portrayed as 'awesome' and 'hip'
hhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllloooooooooo
10But yeah, I don't wear the one you can take in/out either
10My mother tattle taled on me the last time I visited LOL
never had a permanent retainer, no
but looking back at quotes he was always self centred
so did my momm
-m
10I was just like, "Yeah, sure, whatever,"
always asking you to help him
10I wore it for a few weeks, then forgot about it again
whereas others aren't as forceful. So erryfan takes the mick ;D
Falco is sort of an asshole.
10My top teeth might have shifted forward again, but w/e
:P
10I don't care, as long as my teeth don't look horrible
i love you dman

No seas malo, o tendremos que echarte

10You should be wearing it then

12yeah
!espeons
/me now belongs to Aurora for 16 minutes
12room temperature water
ew warm water
I wonder why the other students look at me wierd when i tell them i like MLP:FiM,when they like Transformers:Revenge of The Fallen of all thing!
*things
you can always do it the cheat way
straws
:>
12lol
LOL
and eh
how are ya today
12duct tape your tooth so water doesn't make contact with the tooth
Hey.
/me hides
6I became quite skilled at using straws when I had my wisom teeth removed
I'm alright thanks, you?
I'm making a big list to make a random lottery for mane and b-movies.
how long does that hurt for?
6they say you're not supposed to do that or else you might dry socket the wounds
LL is getting hers removed in a few weeks
12mine didn't hurt at all
6um....a very very long time
Cool.
Adding Truman Show, The Game (1997) and Almost Famous to my list of B-movies.
like, a week?
6but you don't feel much as you're loaded on vicadin all day :D
more/less?
0jugoso estoy yo hoy :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
06lolvicodin
12that's strange Aurora
6let me think though
(I saw all of those, but I found them good.)
6I had my surgery done before they apparently made it better
12i had all 4 wisdoms removed and another tooth to boot at the sametime
12and i didn't hurt whatsoever
Truman Show is a b-movie, right?
6when did you have that done?
12heck, i didn't even take the pain medication the dentist prescribed to me
I have no idea, I'd have to check.
LOL
12hmmm i think around september of last year
6yeah
12XD
6within the past couple years, I think the way wisdom teeth are removed has gotten better
6I had mine done like 6 years ago
0:O:/hello
12ahh
Hello.
12well
12being sedated i'm sure helped as well
12even if i did wake up in the middle of the operation x-x
6no gas, needed numbing shots 5 separate times DURING the operation, and then slept 18 hours of the day while loaded up on vicadin and ibuprofin
6only waking up to eat applesauce, drink water, and take my pennicilin pills
12i bled.... for an unbarable amount of time
6oh lets not forget the pharmacy not getting my medicine on time like they said they would
6and my novacain wore off a half hour before I got it
6that was fun
12oww
6ANYWAYS
12the only complication i had was bleeding for like 17 hours
6what I learned is that it's possible to drink through a straw even if the straw is shoved so far back in your mouth it wont affect your teeth at all
0:):(:D:/:P::O;) mi nombre es ivan pppppppprrrrrrrr
6since drinking through a straw creates a vacuum, which causes dry socket, I needed to find a way to not do that
6:>
6ok
6I also need to mention
6mine needed to be removed like two weeks later
6which was probably the most painful part
12ahh
hello
12how was that like?
6like shoving needles in between your tooth and gumline
6several ties
6times
12x-x
4:D
You didn't tell me aobut almost famous dermathil :P
LOL
Terrible ;.;]
Mi nombre es Darius (Just copying the form, no idea if it's correct :P).
his mum won't let me
Meh, I', not bothered.
I'm*
It's not as though we're really doing anything here anyway.
hhe's sat there giggling away cuz he said 'poo' earlier or something
well LL is getting hers removed in a few weeks, how long do you reckon it'll hurt?
Yea luckily
12i think there is a reason why like half the channel here is birds
12they don't like the dentist so they give themselves beaks
/me hides
6um
LOL
6do you know if she's getting gassed?
no idea
12well
12like Aurora said
6all 4 teeth?
6or be like my friend and have all SIX
12apparently they improved the technology for that kind of operation in the last couple years
12so it shouldn't be like Aurora's experience
0ce
12unless the dentist uses a mac or windows me
6it'll most likely still hurt
6but it also depends on how the teeth are
*_* wow. my dad said if i want to stay here to chat he doesn't mind going out on his own :P yay. It's so awesome. I mean, wow. i mean, having a parent being this nice. wow i'm so happy right now
6mine were deeper than most, and pretty impacted
i still will leave though
to help ; )
as I said, i'm leaving in about 2 hours and will be back at around 11ish
dunno, I'll ask her later
(uktime)
Dman: do you know that movie, Dman?
I don't :P
(I was putting my stuff in the washing machine)
12like i said, i had 5 removed, and it didn't hurt one bit, i didn't even take the pain medication prescribed to me. not to mention they were impacted as well
>musical comedy-drama. huh
6they probably wont be that bad, my experience was set up just right to be pretty horrible
Sorry,i dun derped.
Almost Famous is an oscar-winner.
Based on a true story
made back only 80% of budget D:

That movie was good
0te odio prince dari

6yeah I was too
6for a while
BRB GUYS GOT TO WALK ACROSS THE ROOM AND CLOSE AN 8 Y/O'S BROWSER >8^(
6dunno why yours was so bad though
12dunno
12i went back to the dentist
ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH.
12because i was starting to gag trying to replace the cloth
12and they said it was normal bleeding
Lawl.
6normal yeah
RIGHT YEA!
6but that long after isn't
their parents are looking at my laptop and seeing what he wrote bfore
Yes Dermathil
6blood clots pretty quickly
lol
6so unless you were prodding it and stuff
6it should have stopped bleeding like that
12not really
12i was too afraid to even go anywhere near those areas XD
6exactly
12what can i say
12some people are just bleeders
EPIC
12and some people you start to question if they even do have blood
hehehe
6LOL

"rainbrodash is gay." (trollface.jpg)
hey RBD
12great
nah he didn't say anything since you left
do you know the movie Almost Famous?
or rather ,were kicked
do ho ho ho
hey Sathi
Nice of you to join us, Sathi
heya people
I mean dude
10yo
Hey Sathi.
Sathi: I sent my modship application in yesterday
my school sells Office 2007 and 2010 for $50
that's like $250 off
Ah! So we're getting busy reviewing apps!
they're the super professional ones too that come with everything
apps?
Well best of luck to you
what's this?
dunno?
oh applications? I thought you meant apps as in like iphone or something >_<
not this time
How are you all?
eh, not that kind of apps Dman.
Lul
I'm fine, Sathi. You?
I'm fine
12still though
12200 dollars, or 10 dollars
i'm not so fine... only slept like 2.5hr last night
12it still annoys me to spend money on something open office can do
D= why's that?
well
Ew open office :p
Running on coffee atm
lost the time, while reading a fanfic
Just use the CLOUD
openoffice completely destroys the formatting of most word documents
at least ones I've tried
Dermathil - do you have any other B movie choices? :3
EW THE CLOUD
Oh oh oh i love fanfics! which one?
Runnin' in the coffee.
Haha, I knew you were going to say that
I got Almost Famous that I mentionned earlier.
12were the word documents created in office?
in before the coffee lock
Anyway, MS word or GTFO
Yea you said dermathil earlier I was there =]
Or Office
of course they were made in Office
Blue Skies Ahead
made me cry :(
also, maybe the french movie "The Chorus" from 2004. I remember that movie being good.
12well
Ok haven't read that one
12they could have been made in microsoft word
Don't know The Chorus, i'm afraid, Dermathil
12then opened by openoffice
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372824/
that's what I said
and openoffice ruined it
LOL
Oh. That film.
12[
12you have just blown my mind
We watched that something like 4 times over all the years I did French at shcool.
I've seen stuff on it, but haven't seen it.
lol
hehe
I didn't do french for 4 years, only 2, then picked german
:P
French being my main language...
I did french every year I was at school.
10dari I had that, but with the first Harry Potter in french. About 4 times in my prep school
Haha.
.......I got nothin'.
I think your film was better than ours RainBro. :P
12sigh i hope i don't get stuck in a typing course in college
We should watch http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/ sometime :)
My school has harry potter 1 and 2 in latin in our library :P
12i always hated typing class
10dari just about, yeah
12even after i learned to type
10Dman that's sick
10Want
Hey, Sathi, you remind me of the babe
Hello
RainBroDash - : D
hey Ziltoid
Hey there again Ziltoid
:)
not gonna answer it? i wanted to quote >_<
heh
10http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1063669/ is my A movie choice atm
sorry hun dinner has arrived back in a bit :P
10that or http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0813547/
haven't heard of 'die welle'
or the 2nd one : (
OH
another B-movie. From my little part of the world this time.
b movie idea?
10They're both sick films
I've seen the second one RainBro.
Dashite gave me the original idea for that.
10Dari, did you like it?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479647/
The Re-animator is the best Bmovie of all time
oooo 1985 :P
Dashite once asked me how I'd react to him putting that very movie if he won
I said I'd laugh my ass off.
lol
10:P
but he caused this idea to be "incepted" in my brainz
was it dashite that wanted CUBE really badly?
or you dermathil?
that was me, Dman.
both D names I get confused sorry about that
I'm the Sci-fi junkie.
LOL
......I got ABSOLUTLY nothin'.
(who checked the last link I put up?)
in·cept Graduate from a university with an academic degree
12i'm not good at taking words written down on a piece of paper

bon cop bad cop?
sounds good. I like foreign films, and haven't seen that one
>check Skype
>see what RainBro has posted in my absence
WTF

Time zones. EXTREMELY HARD TO ORGANISE
how does the interview work?

Dermathil - I already told you I did when you asked me :P
^^
Ziltoid did you apply too?
exactly
Nope
0___________________________________0 everypony and their mother applied?
Hopefully I got an edge due to my visibility in chat.
and the fact I found a good rocket lawnchair pic.

Nope.
Dermathil - like a baws, dat kirby
That wasn't the bot.
On EQD it said 144.
10hahahaha
It may be a purposeful
eqd posted drawfriend 155, then edited it for 144, and daribot posted '155' then later when eqd updated '144'
Seth put a pic of trice below it...so that could be the 'and'
all EQD's derps basically :P

why has nopony heard of the 'gar' meme?
GO BUY SOME STOCK RRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH
valthejean, you'd be gar for caramel
yeah sorry, don't know the meme :P
you say you'd 'be Gar for' a male character
when you're straight but would so totally go with them
(it's an actual meme, but unknown and mostly known by ppl who watch animes and stuff)
ah
I see
=]
Wb juhn
well then yes, I'd be Gar for Caramel
http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gar
Lol well said
Gar as an adjective refers to a man who is so incredibly badass and hardcore, his mere presence turns all lesser men into timid, swooning homophiles. Supposedly derived from a misspelling of gay, it was first used by an Anonymous on 4chan’s /a/ board to describe the epic feats of Archer, one of the main characters in the anime Fate/stay night. Trying to say,
I’m Gay for Archer”, he said “I’m Gar for Archer” and the meme took off like a rocket.
lol
7Archer?
7the series?
some anime character
If the cake is the lie, does that make a Klondike Bar worth saving?
Caramel is my husbandu (or is it still waifu?)

@Nittany_Tiger eh....well...honestly it's best not to dwell on that stuff
/me is watching a commentary of Crysis 2 singleplayer, which he bought before it was pulled from Steam. He wasn't so lucky with Dragon Age 2 though...
Why are console games always bigger than PC games. O_o
GUYS my dad 'hmm this isn't that bad' JUST NOW
I wasn't being serious.
03um
03other way around
...fuck
dermathil feels bad man : /
03I said Steam, Steam = PC
Lolno.
If something bad did happen I'm sorry for that.
03Xbox 360 games have a limit of about 6GB.
PS3 games are usually 30GB+
9Well guys I sent Seth my fic update
03that's because Sony puts rootkits in their software :D
Fair enough.
:P
03also, the few PS3 games I've ripped
=D
03were like 6-7GB.
w00t
9that chapter took forever to write
03the rest is just a bunch of filler data
03that doesn't actually do anything
it's all good. I've moved passed it, so there's no worries. You didn't know :P
03LOL
I hate EA just a bit more for removing their games off steam. They just climbed back up to Activision-levels of evil.
9because lot of exposition plus fight scene
/me hopes the following gaming publishers die within two years: EA, Actiivision, and Ubisoft.
sounds like a fun read incoming :P
9Dermathil: WHAT YOU SAY?
9But Nittany, every once in a while Ubisoft does a real bro-move
9like brining Senko no Ronde to the States
9and No More Heroes 1
9their manual stuff is bullshit tho
I dunno then.
9but seriously
9EA removing its games from Steam?
7yep
eyup
9what about the people that own shit like Dead Space already?
7screwed
7:)
DCD: EA just went back up to activisions level of evil. They removed Dragon Age 2 and Crysis 2 from Steam because of Origins.
Ubisoft: "So I herd you liek pirating, so we put draconian DRM in ur game so we can watch you pirate while you pirate every second you pirate."
9Dermathil: Explain that shit for me, please
Real bro move there >.>
9Nittany: I meant for console games
DCD...how could you...
HOW COULD YOU????
lul
http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2011/07/28/dragon-age-2-removed-from-steam-ea-blames-restrictive-terms/
DCD, check this out.
Are you /still/ talking about Caramel? :P
Always
Console gamers are lucky. They only have to put up with publisher greed. Draconian DRM hasn't come full-on yet.
/me cannot unfeel the wounds caused by the infinite pain of this atrocity
9well, doing anything like that on Steam will hurt EA on the long run.
9because I'm pretty sure Valve will not want
9to publish their games via them anymore
Nittany_Tiger: don't say too bad of Ubisoft. The montreal branch is awesome and is 3 hours away from where I live.
Ubisoft created the worst DRM in history.
which is?
Always-on.
Forcing you to be connected to the internet to play SP games.
lol well said
what games?
What about Sony's rootkit DRM?
:P
lol, that's nothing compared to what Capcom's going to do
7why no-one seeds my download :(
IMO that's the worst ever.
Assassin's Creed 2 onward to I forget.
7waiting time a week...
what is it sathi? L4D2 maps?
did you hear about the new DMC copy-right protection?
7nah
7Alestorm
Alestorm!
What is Capcom going to do?
: /
9yeah, holy shit Ubisoft Montreal is love.
sorry to hear it
basically
Worse than Always-on?
9also Capcom is shittier than all the other companies right now
they're making save games impossible to remove
9we're kind of
9oh that
Ubisoft is stupid.
yeah
9wait vAL
Nittany_Tiger: Yes. A. God. Damn. Rootkit.
9seriously?
not fucking kidding
That's Sony.
9I thought after what happened The Mercenaries 3D
I know, that's what I was talking about.
9they said they wouldn't do it again
Creaters of SecuROM.
9because it caused a serious shitstorm
>implying Capcom stays true to its word
9well, yeah
9but
Sony:They don't give a fuck about the community.Or do they?
9after what happened last time
Capcom uses always-on DRM on PS3 downloadable titles.
9they have to be PANTS-ON-HEAD RETARDED To do it again...then again...when haven't they
Pegacorn: they're too rich to give a fuck about you.
Capcom realized a long time ago their fanboys are so rediculous they can cause ANY shitstorm and get away with it
Like Activision can.
...and then I paused to show my family Derpy
ung....Activision
ruined Blizzard
9Activision is a dick
9I wish Infinity Ward didn't belong to them
Activision can request that everyone that buys MW3 give them their deeds to their house, and they'll still break sales records.
: / true
They're already going to charge monthly fees for stats and extra maps.
here's to hoping Valve remains uncorrupted... OH WAIT
Indeed.They don't care about ANYPONY.
Sony that is.
Sadly, some people think it's ok for Activision to be greedy because they're not being like EA or Ubisoft.
man...if I weren't at work I'd blow off some serious frustration in HL2: DM
9we can all agree that the current vidja industry just have companies that suck less than others, right?
9*has
The current industry has a horrible greed problem and needs to crash.
pretty much
9also Val what did you mean with corrupted Valve?
9I did not hear about this
9well Nittany
*cough* TF2 *cough*
9it's a business
9making more money is just
9the way it rolls
9Val: Idungeddit. Mad about the fact it went F2P?
9Or the hat bs?
the problem is not in the companies, but people's stupidity to keep buying their shit
lol, I quit that game *way* before the hats
VALTHEJEAN,DON'T TALK SHIT ABOUT TF2!
it was a perfectly balanced and refined game
And that's when Activision becomes ok for being themselves. Because they're just making money.
and they ran it into the ground
Do you want a gaming industry full of Activision-like publishers?
9*shrug* aren't we already on that situation?
Activision's actions are justified by the fact people keep BUYING activision products
9yeah
if people stopped being mindless sheep, they'd have no marketting power
Exactly.
9which is why I seriously went "wat" on Capcom's actions lately. That sort of shit has BOUND to lose them clients...or at least so I thought
Which is?
lol, never underestimate the streefighter/dmc fanbase
they will keep Capcom going forever
9I like to call it the "Week of Terror"
9>dmc
9I thought the fanbase was still furious about that?
well, I know I am
How is Capcom going to screw gamers over?
but, let's be honest
@NewDCD Can you give me SirSprinkle's Skype? We may need him on TheBronyShow next episode.
they're going to bitch about it until the game comes out
how's the viewing Dman?
but no matter how shitty it is
9Existence: yeah, I got him
they'll buy it
9give me a sec
NewDCD: What happened?
just like the L4D2 boycott
dermathil - good thanks. part 1 finished
OHAI DENIEDEXISTENCE.
MW2 boycott is a better example.
but it's late dermathil, so we now wathcing inecption as that was the plan
7Hmm.
Valve actually met with the gamers to show them the game.
9but Val, the boycott was taken down because the reasons to make a new sequel WERE justified.
(inception in spanish)
7When'll Feather be back, anyone know?
Activision just let sheeplism take the boycott away.
well, my point was that they still bought the game
OHAI PEGACORN
9and at least Valve took the trouble to explain why they were making a boycott, and actually made DLC for L4D1 as they said
and disregarded everything they conplained about
9unlike, you know, Capcom
9OBJECTION!
......KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
9That's the thing
What did Capcom do?
@NewDCD My Skype is Denied_Existence
12In 9000 years
9they were complaining about something that was soon addressed
/me runs
I think I may have mispoke
Capcop want all our mines. GOTCHA!
9when there were no more reasons to complain, it is illogical to continue a boycott
the features that (are now) implemented into L4D1 didn't appear at the same time as L4D2 (it happened shortly after, yes)
my problem:
9Nittany: There's a freaking chart somewhere around here, let me find him
was seeing the group the day L4D2 was released
Hello
and every fucking person was playing it
howdy Barry
9Objection, Val
lol, yes Pheonix?
9allow me
03she's supposedly on Steam right now
9to present my evidence
Well, I'd have to say that Dr. Who is a pretty good sci-fi show
9http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead_2#Boycott
9also, Nittany
EXPLOSION.
Feather will not return
Until TF2 is dead :P
03so HML
03AMD is epic sometimes
Yeah?
03they gave me TWO game codes
03LOL
03for the same game
Amazing :P
03so I'm looking to give one away
03well
03the GPU itself had one in the box
HOLD IT!
03and then NewEgg sent me one as a "free gift"
03so I have two LOL
TAKE THAT!
03It's the game DIRT3, for anyone who likes racing games.
""for people who joined the Boycott Group on Steam ... they're actually pre-ordering the product at a higher rate than Left 4 Dead 1 owners who weren't in the Boycott"
what's going on
I don't have Steam :P
So sorry :<
03Good
03Steam sucks
9Nittany: http://i.imgur.com/yYw7w.jpg
I'm not saying the boycott was justified
I'm saying that the "boycott" was a farce in of itself
And people still use it
because at the end of the day, fanboys are fanboys
I wonder what that reminds me of
/me shot
newdcd - haha seen that bfore :P
hurray! I killed chat!
03LOL
03I use it, unfortunately
lul
03but really only to prod people who won't use IRC *cough*Feather*cough*
03and redeeming lots of free games I have no intent to play
03you can pay as much or as little as you want for like 10 games total
I wonder
in order to spike conversation
YOU OWE ME SOCK PUPPETS NEWDCD

TOMA YA!
UN MOMENTO!
9after all
: D
Can anyone suggest a good PMV or otherwise to play on the next episode of TheBronyShow?
>has played in spanish bfore
9the reason the boycott was shut down was due to that "event"
deniedexistence - the trailer of forrest gump is awesome
9upon seeing that Valve was fulfilling their promise...was there a reason NOT to pre-order?
Link?
sure bro
Is it pony related?
9also
well, the problem is that the issues weren't just content related

03o.o
i'm watching inception
7but but.

7you should wait!
7till the show
7:(
sathi - 2 weeks ago my dad wanted to watch
sowwee
coincidence
What show?
besides it's in spanish so it's not as good :P
Its ok dman
NewDCD: (After reading image) Just like other current gaming publishers. Treat the customers like shit. Just like EA and Sony treats customers like shit. Just like Activision treats customers like cash machines.
pegacorn - movie night!
youre gonna have to watch it again to fully understand it I think
everyone is chatting on skype except me :(
However it IS on a nice and big projector ; )
except steam considers their customers way better.
Movie night is tonight?
Look up Alien Swarm.
ziltoid - yfw i have it on bluray seen it 10 odd times
A full game given away for free.
dermathil - it was meh
lolwut
Then, TF2 goes free.
!espeon !sneas !umbreon
/me now belongs to Link for 30 minutes
/me now belongs to Link for 10 minutes
/me now belongs to Link for 12 minutes
but judge yourself : P
Ive only wacthed it once
Dman, I loved that game. It was given for free so the community would provide support for the game. They also threw the source code out.
yeah, TF2 goes free after they realized what a trainwreck it was :P
hey guys
hai
howdy Flutterhi
sup flutterhi!
...at work :D
yep :)
what is this madness? O_o
Hi FlutterHi
I'm at my sys admin job
@dman my brain...it is not ready
Valve has faults, but compared to other gaming publishers on the PC front, they're saints.
valthejean for what? oh the puzzle :P
fixing webforms... and chatting with my bronies <3
:P
They actually /care/ about gamers.
ValtheJean, TF2 was never a trainwreck.
Its been supported for 4 years now.
And are profiting.
valthejean - when i have time i'll show you the ponychan i saved it but gotta upload it somewhere to show ya
it 404d
That's more than most games out there.
it's more like a storage house full of stupid hats
@Support =/= quality
>tf2 >trainwreck. what am i reading?
@Dermathil*
that was built ontop of traintracks
Duke Nukem is getting DLC, which is technically support
I'm lost
and frankly, that is one atomic bomb sized wreck
Portal is getting free console dlc - unheard of. thank ya kindly, valve :D
ValtheJean: Duke nukem won't even have support a year from now.
@NewDCD, what did you say your Skype was?
tf2 is a storage house full of hats with several trains who are going to collide with it
Even the 360 version?
deniedexistece i have it if ya want
nittany eyup ! :D
@Dermathil I could only hope so
12What's your steam name drf?
I thought Microsoft forced fees on DLC>
but they have MLP maps
that's y valve is awesum
@FlutterHiAtWork: meh, that's what happens when someone never saw what the original game looked like.
but nontheless, it still stands that supporting a game does not make it quality
Back xD
and to be fair
That's why Valve didn't originally release free DLC on the 360 while releasing the same DLC free on the PC.
@Dman Well don't just sit there! Hand me it!
i suppose so
12If you don't mind me asking
lolk
TF2 vanilla was great
12Oh, lol
Look, let's all agree to disagree here
I hated TF2 originally. No instruction manual. No tutorial. Just get raped learning how to play.
I DISAGREE WITH YOUR ATTEMPTS TO AGREE TO DISAGREE
In comparison to the bare stuff the original game had (which was the basic loadout and 8 maps in total), Steam added 20+ new maps, TONS of new weapons, and ways to make you more recogniseable.
when i tf2 i just feal like I'm playing counterstrike but I'm actually good
where's the fun in that
deniedexistence - he goes by 'D' but can't see where his email is
@Nittany_Tiger hah, clearly you never played DM
Wait...what?
I'm bad at MP shooters in general.
Give me his EXACT Skype account
how do i view profiles >_<
@Dermathil and it's those weapons and changes that MADE TF2 a trainwreck
I'll stick to unreal tourney. Halo CE and CSS
I'm one of the rare people that dislike Battlefield. I hate BF games because they're too hard.
And now they're catching elitism syndrome.
I hate battlefields because fuck realism
well, that will happen with any game
12Yay now I know where everyone on steam is :D
/me runs
any online game is going to have elitists
ValtheJean: not really. If you disagree with these weapons, then I won't stop you. But I find that the tons of new weapons give alot more variability in the playstyles.
Yeah.
I'd much rather shoot a gun that looks like an alien penis and launches an inordinat amount of ammo
7And DRF; yes, I've noticed.
02I'm a shadow dudeeee </reference>, you can't find me
7*late*
But I feel like a dead weight more than BF games than in any other game.
7It's version 2.0, too! D:
@Dermathil fair enough. I'll agree that we have a difference of opinion
Which basically makes everything hard to do.
I have a friend playing BF3 alpha
7But I don't want 10 entire games, lol. XD
12k, I'll add you if you don't mind Ray XD
7Maybe when the promotion is over and it's updated on Steam. o.o
sigh...now I miss HL2: DM
it sure is a pretty game
who wants to watch some frag vids, ey?
06lol
yessss
make this old timer remember the glory days :P
03I buy them just because I support the program'
God i misss when UT was THE SHIT
03and I pay more than $1 :P
7I know. o.o
03I meant $1, btw, not 10
ah deniedexistence - skype name 'Time-diver'
I like MP games like RTCW and UT2K4, which I enjoyed.
name 'D'
ValtheJean: alright then. I do hate often on the spy silent knife, but I understand that you can counter it if you're careful enough.
7Well, it is a good deal. :P
got that deniedexistence?
7Windosill, being the toy it is, was $3. :P
No unbalancing unlocks. No KDR. Just the game with awesome modes.
7I should pay more for 10 games, though. O_o
@Dermathil lol...don't even get me started on how useless the backguard was
you know what new game I loved
what?
Section 8 prejudice
ValtheJean: I know. The shield was shit. But it was a good concept
Thanks
=]
for anyone who cares
that game is fucking brillian
that is what I will be watching for nostalgia :P
I haven't found my footing in MP shooters since I stopped playing UT2K4.
valthejean hurray you fond it!
If it could've regenerated after a while, like 30 or 60 seconds, instead of needing to go back to spawn to get a new one
found *
And I can't get footing in BF games.
7Val?
well, that's ONE of em
yeah?
7Can I actually pay, like, $0.01? >>
:P
03that's why they let you pick
7how long left on your workday?
03Yep LOL
:(
03though they guilt-trip you if you pay less than $1
03I paid $6.66, because who doesn't like that number
about 2 1/2 hours
well how long?
oh
not too bad
? I work for another hour
03(And at the time, there were only 5 games - the older ones were just added today)
got any interesting jobs rite now?
yay~
7Weeeell...
7Here's the thing:
well, I'm currently converting a chainsaw from poly to NURBS
ValtheJean: I though find that all the weapons have a good concept behind them.
and now bringing it into inventor
lol
@Dermathil I can see that. They did have some good ideas
can we get a brony halo CE game going?
YES
later thou
:D
yeah
my issue was that they upset the refined balance of the game
:)
03and it's a full sized motherboard too
/me doesn't have a copy of that game.
Really O>o
Wat
03yep
03want a picture
03XD
aww
^
I can upload a copy
Sure
7I got into the PPPPPP Remix Album (VVVVVV soundtrack) by contacting VVVVVV's music writer after a message he left on a pirating site asking to e-mail him unreleased music. o.o
w00t doo eet
that's portable and shit
I'd have to steal one.
7Well, that's the truncated version.
hey, I'd happily play DM with you guys :P
will do
I'm 99% pushed to piracy anyway by gaming publisher bullshit.
03http://files.humblebundle.com/VVVVVV_2.0_Win3.exe?key=7yfmdvMSszzh&ttl=1312497118&t=1dc69afb6ba9dca24ea581f6318db273
03you could also just use that
03>_>
03that's my paid-key
flutterhiatwork please do ^_^
7o.O?
03but it has no DRM so yeah
ValtheJean: I personally prefered the weapons that were a sidegrade (not an upgrade but a weapons that is as good but that fits a different play-style like the bow) instead of the upgrades.
7Oh, LOOK.
03You don't HAVE to use them in STeam.
03They also come with stand-alone versions.
My PC won't accept the software for my HP Officejet 6500 printer because it runs Win 7 and now Vista or XP D=
03I just copied the link from MY purchase
7http://www.souleye.se/ <-- Yes! The Humble Indie Bundle features VVVVVV and four other cool titles! Now you can get them all for as little as ONE PENNY.
@piratemeter Dermathil
6 Dermathil is 51% pirate. (966)
I'll upload later when I get out of work
03LOL
:P
I AM A PIRATE
@piratemeter Dman
6 Dman is 71% pirate. (967)
=]
lul
/me starts to sing the song.
03...
7I'd actually like them on Steam, DRF. :P
7that you are
@freemeter dman
6 dman is 45% free. (968)
03it comes with a key that lets you play Minecraft for free
Do what you want because a pirate is free!
03until August 14 anyway
/me does what he wants cuz a pirate is free. He is a pirate ~~~
03I refuse to get hooked on that sillyness, but LOL free Minecraft
7Nah.
xP
@Dman Do you know what sir sprinkle's Skype is?
7But anyway, that key:
sorry deniedexistence, no
Free of DRM. Free of online passes.
7Actually:
03http://i.imgur.com/z4yEw.jpg <- ignore the "ew" LOL
03and uh
03rotate it o.o
ask newdcd for sirsprinkles' skype
7I'd actually rather pay SOMETHING for the games. o.o
Ok, New is from panama right?
03if you want it in Steam you'd have to buy it yourself
similarly, the scout update went from making him an objective runner to a hit-and-run assassination style with high "burst" damage.
03since I already redeemed my Steam keys
03etc
7Yep.
Where is the ew? :P
03in the image URL
I just dislike those changes a lot
hahaha
it screws with high end play
03also LOL "Unleash your 6950 and it'll unleash you" <- that sounds... bad x.x
But wow
/me thinks he should hold off of playing TF2 online until he unlocks more weapons during practice matches.
Sounds kinky?
yes he is deniedexistence
/me mauled
It also fucks with popularity
and sales
The Kritzkrieg was also a good morale killer (you don't wanna run toward a 100%-critting heavy) while the uber made the target a sponge.
;__; can't run TF2 even though downloaded
What I find ValtheJean is that the changes were made to fit different play-styles.
i love the 'meet the' though
!ew FAT16
13EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW FAT16
eh, honestly if they wanted such different playstyles they should have made a different game
which they basically did
some still have to use it
for older operating systems
I don't mind it
FUUCK
I never liked the basic demoman. I prefer demoknight with the shield, caber and lochnload, for example.
IM FUCKING OFF TO READ
BEST FANFIC
...?
Ok.
that's my no.1 fanfic deniedexistence =]

I see...
@Dermathil, did you ever learn sticky-hoping? or have they removed that since then?
this song has been glued to my brain
ValtheJean: nah. They gave the players more choice in their loadout. I prefer playing with jarate than with the smg.
:O TRIXIE TIME
and won't leave
Valthejean, they haven't.
It is a mechanic they won't remove.
That's why some people stick to it and don't play demoknight.
but did you actually learn it?
yes I did.
@dman it's always trixie time
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8HlxlwGfKY&feature=related
I also learnt how to grenade-jump with the basic grenade launcher (just need to get the timing right with the rolling grenade)
but this one is trixie - Broken Heart is trying to make trixie evil : /
7Well, DRF, I'm paying a dollar. X.x
I also like to play with the pyro, though I don't use any set.
/me 7doesn't have that much in a personal account, anyway.
lol
03LOL go ahead
7Okay.
03they actually let you pay as little as you want for a reason :P

im sorry i need my fix for the day
03I mainly like the Humble Indie guys because they basically don't care about overcharing you
I use the 3rd flamethrower since I love the airblast so damn much, flaregun and the health hammer.
3rd flamethrower?

hi kos
03see, here's the thing, you get people who pay like $10000 so they can get their name on the top donors list, so they actually make MORE money on average than a typical game company. :>

The basic flamethrower, the backburner and a flamethrower that makes less damage than the base one but with a faster weapon change.
03no hard drive yet though.

03Turns out, my motherboard doesn't have an IDE connector, so I can't use the old IDE hard drive I was going to use >_>

so one can go ambush-pyro, jugglepyro and base pyro.
03cuz really, you don't need a very big hard drive to mine data
Ouch
lol
(jugglepyro is when you keep someone in the air with the airblast)
I think it's best I stop commenting...as it's making me frustrated again
okay i need another

03and the fact that you can't play Valve games without having STeam running in the background, hogging your bandwidth etc.
@roll 1 9

You can roll a letter?
@roll over 9000
6Dman rolls a
03that, and the fact that Valve basically deleted LL's account TWICE in a row and refuses to help her :| so I hate them for that too

hahahahaha
.........
12ewww salt and vinegar
Pegacorn: nope. What happens is that both are negated. Aka: the immovable is moved, but the unstoppable gradually loses speed. That way at various point in time both happens.
I like to think that when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, two seperate yet identical realities are created
dash
12I'll send you them in the post
12and you can be a man instead ;3
DeniedExistence,i was making a "ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH" joke.
in which one place the immovable object is destroyed, the other where the unstoppable force is halted

so I don't know whether it's legit or a giant trollface

2. PinkiePie
7it's legit
MMO Champion' speculation that it might be the next expansion has been met by skepticism by several media outlets.[3][4] 1UP actually tried to contact Blizzard about this and the reply was "not ready to reveal any details at this time".[5]
no pinkie pie is always first

jk
7For the record, the international codes 009 and 041 only seems to appear on Blizzard's online games trademarks. This isn't a book or anything like that. It appears incredibly likely based on previous trademarks obtained by Blizzard that this is the next expansion.
nope i play runescape
