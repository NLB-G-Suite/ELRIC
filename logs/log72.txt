They had a policeman with them.

Would you assume he's one of the cannibals too outright?
wat
lol moar torchwood plz?

11No, but if he's turning on them, then he's not a fucking cop, imo
THAT WAS THE BEST DAY EVER
He turned on them, then he would have killed Owen.
If they tried anything.
One side always puts their guns down.
It's not stupid, that's just the way people always do it.

Much nicer way to put it is anyone can be a pop star with those four chords
They are shitting over musical wonders like Miracle of Sound.
TORCHWOOD BITCHES
but
ACTUAL musicians but a load of effort into it
They're kind of poking fun at their own idea, actually
11But those four chords aren't even heard in half of the songs they mentioned.
1812?
Angry sex incoming?
11It's just coincidence that they match.
After this episode it puts us half way through the series.
Well, more than half way I suppose.
I was saying that a LOT of people considered "musicians" are less than sub-par
03god dang it
And they are above-par.
12I'm not sure if even I can make decks like that

03....
03Glacymr
03I'm kinda scared
12?
03my filling
03fell out
03x.x
03there's literally now a hole in my tooth
03I didn't even think fillings could fall out like that
12yeah.... i think you should have that checked at
03-g
03hm
03well
03you know how I said it hurt?
03it doesn't hurt now
causing it to fall out
yeh
03the hole
hmm
that might be it then
03How can a filling hurt?
12was probably a really bad filling
03LOL
03dude
03my dentist has been a dentist for years
03maybe it was just because he was pressed for time LOL
12even the professionals make mistakes from time to time
03hm
03well
03or should i be fine?
12well
12there is a reason we get those holes filled in
07just avoid getting food stuck in it
03OK
03well
12yeah
03it's like the very far right tooth
12no steak for you
03I can't really reach it iwth a toothbrush even
03so I shouldn't have to worry
07and it hurts because the hole often goes through to the nerves
03well
03how come it no longer hurts now that the filling fell out?
/me shrugs
03:/
03anyway see
03here's the weird thijng
03after that filling fell out
12maybe there was some sort of pressure inside the tooth
03but then when I went to keep eating, I still tasted metal
03so I dunno if it maybe just didn't all come out at once
12that would of course cause pain and the pressure finally released itself when the filling fell out
03or if somethingelse is going on :/
03pressure inside the tooth? is that normal?
12i'm not a dentist
03I know
03but you have more experience with fillings than I do LOL
07that's because metal fillings have tiny amounts of mercury
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOtMizMQ6oM
03...isn't mercury toxic?
12yes
03frick LOL
03if I die
03then goodbye
03XD
07and it isn't in that amount
12yeah
03-d
12fish has mercury
03LOL
/me hides
/me learned this from a CSI episode
03XD
03well
07and lol
03so that would explain why I kept tasting metal even though I thought I got it lal out?
03*all
07that wasn't a gangster thing
03I'm just scared to eat now
03because chewing metal is like, really bad
03LOL really
07in the foot-powered drills era lol
07or a grill
07XD

or did I somehow get that on my own
I can't remember
03not sure

07lol
07speaking of popcorn I was just afk to make some
lite I think...
07and yes you'll be fine, just avoid chewing with that tooth
03OK
03as that one's free
03actually
03they're all free now XD
03but
03they all got removed from the official Android market for some copyright crap

you cycle through 10 clips with CTRL adn 1 - 0
and you have TEN available clips
and paste any given one
faster than selecting and copying the second part

hi
Hey there Barry!
I was just idle\
Bai
guys, I got an Idea. I am putting the movie "The Game" on top of my B-movie selection list.
Oh?
could be seen as a trolololol while being a real movie. It is interesting and slightly mind-screw, but not in the way you intend it to be.
and 3 tv shows
Which one?
Ok gotcha
is that the one with a tv in a house?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBiMo5JvUqA&feature=player_embedded
Best. Card trick. EVER.
also very VERY recent
wow.
dman: there's more than just a tv in a house.
IS it good?
yes
yeah
(especially because of the name)
(trololo)
yeah
(have you seen the magic trick?)
watching it now
and it is hilarious
It is! :P
and it is a pretty good trick.
shows why he's the best card magister.
How does he do it! >_<
Eyup
(he paid the guys at the factory to make another deck like that)
(dat signature)
but that's possible :P
he did seem to put a card into the 'new deck' at some point
but putting it in right order?
and dat seal
hahaha
same
I usually like it to try to find the trick behind it.
yes =]
/me remembers to refresh his mailbox.
I'm watching the show now
to see some other tricks that get figured out
see if I can figure em out :P

never had a permanent retainer, no
but looking back at quotes he was always self centred

10I was just like, "Yeah, sure, whatever,"
always asking you to help him
10I wore it for a few weeks, then forgot about it again
Falco is sort of an asshole.

Hmm.
what's that
12XD
heh
06Roaras
and no
and x.x
12yeah
!espeons
*things
you can always do it the cheat way
straws
:>
12lol
LOL
and eh
how are ya today
Hey.
/me hides
6I became quite skilled at using straws when I had my wisom teeth removed
I'm alright thanks, you?
how long does that hurt for?
6they say you're not supposed to do that or else you might dry socket the wounds
12mine didn't hurt at all
6um....a very very long time
Cool.
like, a week?
6but you don't feel much as you're loaded on vicadin all day :D
more/less?
0jugoso estoy yo hoy :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
06lolvicodin
6let me think though
(I saw all of those, but I found them good.)
12i had all 4 wisdoms removed and another tooth to boot at the sametime
12and i didn't hurt whatsoever
Truman Show is a b-movie, right?
6when did you have that done?
12heck, i didn't even take the pain medication the dentist prescribed to me
I have no idea, I'd have to check.
LOL
6yeah
12XD
6I had mine done like 6 years ago
0:O:/hello
12ahh
Hello.
12well
12being sedated i'm sure helped as well
12even if i did wake up in the middle of the operation x-x
6no gas, needed numbing shots 5 separate times DURING the operation, and then slept 18 hours of the day while loaded up on vicadin and ibuprofin
12i bled.... for an unbarable amount of time
6and my novacain wore off a half hour before I got it
6that was fun
12oww
6ANYWAYS
12the only complication i had was bleeding for like 17 hours
6since drinking through a straw creates a vacuum, which causes dry socket, I needed to find a way to not do that
6:>
6ok
6I also need to mention
6I didn't have dissolvable stitches like people have now
6mine needed to be removed like two weeks later
6which was probably the most painful part
12ahh
hello
12how was that like?
6several ties
6times
12x-x
4:D
LOL
Terrible ;.;]

It's not as though we're really doing anything here anyway.
hhe's sat there giggling away cuz he said 'poo' earlier or something
Yea luckily
12i think there is a reason why like half the channel here is birds
/me hides
6um
LOL
6do you know if she's getting gassed?
no idea
12well
6all 4 teeth?
6or be like my friend and have all SIX
12apparently they improved the technology for that kind of operation in the last couple years
12so it shouldn't be like Aurora's experience
0ce
6it'll most likely still hurt
6but it also depends on how the teeth are
6mine were deeper than most, and pretty impacted
to help ; )
dunno, I'll ask her later
(uktime)
Dman: do you know that movie, Dman?
I don't :P
12like i said, i had 5 removed, and it didn't hurt one bit, i didn't even take the pain medication prescribed to me. not to mention they were impacted as well
>musical comedy-drama. huh
6they probably wont be that bad, my experience was set up just right to be pretty horrible
made back only 80% of budget D:

That movie was good
looks good

/me thinks Val is no longer welcome at home :p

03um
03other way around
...fuck
Lolno.
If something bad did happen I'm sorry for that.
03Xbox 360 games have a limit of about 6GB.
PS3 games are usually 30GB+
Fair enough.
:P
03also, the few PS3 games I've ripped
=D
03were like 6-7GB.
w00t
03the rest is just a bunch of filler data
03that doesn't actually do anything
03LOL
9because lot of exposition plus fight scene
9But Nittany, every once in a while Ubisoft does a real bro-move
9like brining Senko no Ronde to the States
9and No More Heroes 1
I dunno then.
9but seriously
7yep
eyup
7screwed
7:)
9Dermathil: Explain that shit for me, please
9Nittany: I meant for console games
DCD...how could you...
HOW COULD YOU????
http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2011/07/28/dragon-age-2-removed-from-steam-ea-blames-restrictive-terms/
Always
/me cannot unfeel the wounds caused by the infinite pain of this atrocity
9to publish their games via them anymore
Ubisoft created the worst DRM in history.
which is?
Always-on.
lol well said
:P
7why no-one seeds my download :(
IMO that's the worst ever.
Assassin's Creed 2 onward to I forget.
7waiting time a week...
7nah
7Alestorm
Alestorm!
: /
sorry to hear it
basically
Worse than Always-on?
9also Capcom is shittier than all the other companies right now
9we're kind of
9oh that
Ubisoft is stupid.
yeah
9wait vAL
9seriously?
not fucking kidding
9they said they wouldn't do it again
Creaters of SecuROM.
9well, yeah
9but
Sony:They don't give a fuck about the community.Or do they?
Capcom uses always-on DRM on PS3 downloadable titles.
9they have to be PANTS-ON-HEAD RETARDED To do it again...then again...when haven't they
...and then I paused to show my family Derpy
ung....Activision
ruined Blizzard
9I wish Infinity Ward didn't belong to them
They're already going to charge monthly fees for stats and extra maps.
here's to hoping Valve remains uncorrupted... OH WAIT
9we can all agree that the current vidja industry just have companies that suck less than others, right?
9*has
pretty much
9I did not hear about this
9well Nittany
*cough* TF2 *cough*
9it's a business
9making more money is just
9the way it rolls
9Val: Idungeddit. Mad about the fact it went F2P?
9Or the hat bs?
the problem is not in the companies, but people's stupidity to keep buying their shit
VALTHEJEAN,DON'T TALK SHIT ABOUT TF2!
Do you want a gaming industry full of Activision-like publishers?
9*shrug* aren't we already on that situation?
9yeah
Exactly.
Which is?
lol, never underestimate the streefighter/dmc fanbase
9I like to call it the "Week of Terror"
9>dmc
9I thought the fanbase was still furious about that?
well, I know I am
How is Capcom going to screw gamers over?
but, let's be honest
how's the viewing Dman?
but no matter how shitty it is
9Existence: yeah, I got him
they'll buy it
9give me a sec
just like the L4D2 boycott
7Hmm.
(inception in spanish)
and disregarded everything they conplained about
9unlike, you know, Capcom
9OBJECTION!
......KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
9That's the thing
12In 9000 years
9they were complaining about something that was soon addressed
/me runs
I think I may have mispoke
Capcop want all our mines. GOTCHA!
9when there were no more reasons to complain, it is illogical to continue a boycott
the features that (are now) implemented into L4D1 didn't appear at the same time as L4D2 (it happened shortly after, yes)
my problem:
9Nittany: There's a freaking chart somewhere around here, let me find him
was seeing the group the day L4D2 was released
Hello
and every fucking person was playing it
9Objection, Val
9allow me
9to present my evidence
9http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead_2#Boycott
9also, Nittany
EXPLOSION.
03AMD is epic sometimes
Yeah?
03LOL
Amazing :P
03so I'm looking to give one away
03well
HOLD IT!
03and then NewEgg sent me one as a "free gift"
03so I have two LOL
TAKE THAT!
what's going on
03Good
03Steam sucks
9Nittany: http://i.imgur.com/yYw7w.jpg
I'm not saying the boycott was justified
I'm saying that the "boycott" was a farce in of itself
And people still use it
because at the end of the day, fanboys are fanboys
/me shot
03LOL
03I use it, unfortunately
03and redeeming lots of free games I have no intent to play
03you can pay as much or as little as you want for like 10 games total
in order to spike conversation
9PROTESTO!
ok
Lool
9It was not necessarily a farce!
UN MOMENTO!
9after all
: D
>has played in spanish bfore
deniedexistence - the trailer of forrest gump is awesome
9upon seeing that Valve was fulfilling their promise...was there a reason NOT to pre-order?
Link?
Is it pony related?
9also
well, the problem is that the issues weren't just content related

Ive only wacthed it once
hey guys
hai
...at work :D
yep :)
hey flutterhi - prince-dari's gonna make another puzzle!
Hi FlutterHi
@dman my brain...it is not ready
:P
They actually /care/ about gamers.
Its been supported for 4 years now.
And are profiting.
it 404d
That's more than most games out there.
it's more like a storage house full of stupid hats
@Support =/= quality
@Dermathil*
that was built ontop of traintracks
I'm lost
and frankly, that is one atomic bomb sized wreck
Even the 360 version?
deniedexistece i have it if ya want
nittany eyup ! :D
that's y valve is awesum
Back xD
and to be fair
@Dman Well don't just sit there! Hand me it!
12If you don't mind me asking
lolk
12Oh, lol
Look, let's all agree to disagree here
I hated TF2 originally. No instruction manual. No tutorial. Just get raped learning how to play.
when i tf2 i just feal like I'm playing counterstrike but I'm actually good
where's the fun in that
deniedexistence - he goes by 'D' but can't see where his email is
Wait...what?
Give me his EXACT Skype account
how do i view profiles >_<
I'll stick to unreal tourney. Halo CE and CSS
I'm one of the rare people that dislike Battlefield. I hate BF games because they're too hard.
And now they're catching elitism syndrome.
I hate battlefields because fuck realism
/me runs
Yeah.
You don't play a sniper with a jarate the same way you play a sniper with the normal smg, for example.
I'd much rather shoot a gun that looks like an alien penis and launches an inordinat amount of ammo
7And DRF; yes, I've noticed.
7*late*
7It's version 2.0, too! D:
Which basically makes everything hard to do.
7But I don't want 10 entire games, lol. XD
06lol
yessss
03I buy them just because I support the program'
03and I pay more than $1 :P
7I know. o.o
name 'D'
7Well, it is a good deal. :P
got that deniedexistence?
7Windosill, being the toy it is, was $3. :P
7I should pay more for 10 games, though. O_o
Section 8 prejudice
Thanks
=]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99_ziM7mT7I
found *
And I can't get footing in BF games.
7Val?
well, that's ONE of em
yeah?
7Can I actually pay, like, $0.01? >>
:P
03that's why they let you pick
03Yep LOL
:(
03though they guilt-trip you if you pay less than $1
about 2 1/2 hours
well how long?
oh
not too bad
? I work for another hour
03(And at the time, there were only 5 games - the older ones were just added today)
got any interesting jobs rite now?
yay~
7Weeeell...
7Here's the thing:
well, I'm currently converting a chainsaw from poly to NURBS
and now bringing it into inventor
lol
YES

03and it's a full sized motherboard too
Really O>o
Wat
03yep
03want a picture
03XD
aww
^
I can upload a copy
Sure
7I got into the PPPPPP Remix Album (VVVVVV soundtrack) by contacting VVVVVV's music writer after a message he left on a pirating site asking to e-mail him unreleased music. o.o
w00t doo eet
that's portable and shit
I'd have to steal one.
7Well, that's the truncated version.
I'm 99% pushed to piracy anyway by gaming publisher bullshit.

flutterhiatwork please do ^_^
7o.O?
7Oh, LOOK.
03They also come with stand-alone versions.
03I just copied the link from MY purchase
7http://www.souleye.se/ <-- Yes! The Humble Indie Bundle features VVVVVV and four other cool titles! Now you can get them all for as little as ONE PENNY.
I'll upload later when I get out of work
03LOL
:P
@piratemeter Dman

03...
7that you are
@freemeter dman
6 dman is 45% free. (968)
7Nah.
xP
7But anyway, that key:
sorry deniedexistence, no
Free of DRM. Free of online passes.
7Actually:
03http://i.imgur.com/z4yEw.jpg <- ignore the "ew" LOL
03and uh
03rotate it o.o
03Quanyails that's the standalone version.
7I'd actually rather pay SOMETHING for the games. o.o
03etc
7Yep.
Where is the ew? :P
03in the image URL
I just dislike those changes a lot
hahaha
it screws with high end play
But wow
/me thinks he should hold off of playing TF2 online until he unlocks more weapons during practice matches.
yes he is deniedexistence
/me mauled
It also fucks with popularity
and sales
!ew FAT16

this song has been glued to my brain
:O TRIXIE TIME
and won't leave
It is a mechanic they won't remove.
That's why some people stick to it and don't play demoknight.
but did you actually learn it?
yes I did.
@dman it's always trixie time
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8HlxlwGfKY&feature=related
I also learnt how to grenade-jump with the basic grenade launcher (just need to get the timing right with the rolling grenade)
7Well, DRF, I'm paying a dollar. X.x
/me 7doesn't have that much in a personal account, anyway.
lol
03LOL go ahead

MMO Champion' speculation that it might be the next expansion has been met by skepticism by several media outlets.[3][4] 1UP actually tried to contact Blizzard about this and the reply was "not ready to reveal any details at this time".[5]
no pinkie pie is always first

/me keeps being interrupted in his 'estrella noctis 'reading
as too many people would QQ over "OMG WHY AREN'T THEY ON MY FACTION"
7we got the awesome goblins in return
jk
7For the record, the international codes 009 and 041 only seems to appear on Blizzard's online games trademarks. This isn't a book or anything like that. It appears incredibly likely based on previous trademarks obtained by Blizzard that this is the next expansion.
7thanks Dari
phhfff...goblins are just a reskinned gnome
I don't believe in "MMORPG's"
