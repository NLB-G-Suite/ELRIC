candy-mane: give him time
4 days is too soon
genetic engineering
I've heard show them Lesson Zero or Bridle Gossip
Show him an episode, if it works he'll seek the rest out himself.
flutter_spin: It's about itme is a good one too
But the music from Living Tombstone or Bronies react to Teens video works
What do you mean why? Your ship is dressed as a web creature!
What are you guys talking about? How to convert non-belivers?
The only thing I would say is have him watch from the start and move on
Yes Malavolent
that i met only 4 days ago
dammit. I missed the part where glitch Bob came back.
My car only plays MLP music remixs. eventually people ask who is singing or what the situation is. Then they watch the episode. then more episodes.

What the hell happened to your status espeon
I wonder what it looked like before the pod exploded...
Alister: Seduct XD
Implore
Alister: You mean seduce?
i
have no idea
Oh look, the movie night is in 4 hours

it's "Who says a girl can't really have it all"
hi all that came in.
hello aylnine
Let the hate flow through you!
hi WallDives ^^
07or something.
Transmutate has had enough of your shit.
/me regenerates
isnt that the starscream clone?
not a clone
Trasmutate used Bitch slap
no, that was dinobot I thought
they tried to replicate the ability of starscream's spark to never die.
the result was rampage
that's some chest
Antigrav crystal. U jelly.
RX-78-SweetieBot i know. close enough ^^
wally on drugs?
Jelly
?
I dun think transmutate has a spark...
If it had no spark it wouldn't be able to move.
he has one
hes not the same race >_>
Meanwhile or it's just a robot
I don't think that's how it works.
there is no "just a robot" in transformers
why not?
Because a spark is like life force.
if it has a personality, it has a spark
yeah, well I think that only cybertronians have spark, so there >_>
^
Transmutate is a cybertronian
bah, humbug
he is a protoform that got damaged in the pod
oh Meanwhile... I posted my fanfic: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid if you want to read it
maybe... transmutate... could be a mutant
and failed to scan an alt mode
are we just arguing on pure conjecture, with no real fact or information?
a mutant is failry acurate
Hey kids! guess what?
fairly
chicken butt?
hi FlareChaser what?
I know my transformers.
Invi: I'm awesome.
FlareChaser: you have a front butt ?
scootabutt?
FlareChaser that's good for you ^^
must just be me then RX-78-SweetieBot
Invi: You're awesome too! :3
Transmutate is what the Protoforms look like before the pods scan for DNA.
That is Wall-E-T ^^
FlareChaser: you found scootaloo in a box?
lol
Why can't we be friends? Why can't we be friends?
he's a bit like a bird
Oh Please ! , I f YOU're awsome. My coolness destroyed the universe 32 times already
Hey bronystate! Todayith beith aith specialith dayith!!!

otakon17: Makes sense. Sorry to hear that.
Syvä iskumme on viha voittamaton, ei armoa ei kotimaata! Koko onnemme kalpamme kärjessä on, ei rintamme heltyä saata. Our strike is deep and wrath undefeated! No Mercy, No Fatherland! Our Faith on the tip of our blades, no force may make take us down!
The hell?
Dat wall...

I mean come on... I kinda grew up on that don'tcha know?
Shizuka: then it made fun of itself
otakon17: cant right now

i liked VeggieTales.......i found it OK.

Oh, tyvm Invi! :)

I'm fairly sure not discussing controversial topics is in the rules.
Or maybe I could take advantage of this and toast marshmellows.
WASGHFANSFA SHHOly Shit....
13well, we prefer not to have drama bust out
Why do people always get butt hurt over relgion?
Or at least, were.

Bronysith: try watching them in the following order: IV,V,II,III,VI
CCCP: i hate the lightsaber battles so much
Who the schmuck is jar jar bings.
Unnr: how about IV V VI
Bronysith: eh, i think they are okay
/me has the untouched laserdisk rips Star Wars on the computer.

Bronysith: ya i guess but i can see why some people like it
cowvarkian: aww
CCCP: yea stupid kids
Oh, I'm saving this for shots, Single Barrel is worth the expense! I could sip on this for awhile
Bronysith: IV V VI works well, but if you want the full balance to the force arc it works better with episodes II and III worked in
because I actually like all the movies...
Unnr: the prequels are non canon
and I like the ewoks
Is it too late to bring back the religious debate?
and jar jar
Episode 2 did have that awesome Jango vs Obiwan fight.
o dat jar jar
Meanwhile, its best not to ^^
cowvarkian: well thats cool, i know alot of people that do
Digitalis: It'd be better than this.
who thinks mick foley should do a voice on the show
Bronysith: the prequels are A cannon and you know it. afterall, skippy is canon.
but someone is bound to do it...
how about i do a review of the entire star wars saga for you all!
:( but I love religion.
I <3 Skippy, the jedi droid
how about no EpicPwnTime2
Unnr: the prequels are non canon

silence of the lambs? oh my
FlareChaser the perspective doesn't fit that well
good choice
and am I supposed to know who mick foley is alexxm?
Bronysith: but the prequels being cannon are the reason that anikin skywalker-solo had such a bad death in the AU
bye OmegaMetroidBrony
Invi: Well like...thats just your opinion...man
Mick Foley, if I recall correctly, was a wrestler from the WWF.
drf ill be tuning in toda

FlareChaser sorry for critisism :P
mick foley is mankind

Yeah, Mankind, that was it.

Oh, my day's been fine.

Do you want cuz a pirate is free! YOU ARE A PIRATE!

You have to show fluttershy either Silence of the Lambs or Watership down. which do you choose?

Silence.
watership down
It has less animal beatings.
TheMaster: both
pop tarts?
Does anyone else have the ability to host a server for Terraria?
m
I need a hug :(
Hi alexxm, :P I missed your ping, day was rough, but got back safe so its all good - My Mom's coming over in a bit to pick up the dogs and move them to their (parents) house
TheMaster: then i make her watch a bunch of gory horror movies
you're good people cccp
what happened Cypresswolf
hostel or saw?
cmon everybody! lets hug that british guy!!!!
Invi: eh, if I try to make it flat it kinda looks....worse? so...eh
Anyflank
Nevermind, I'll just brave the unknown on my own.
TheMaster: yes i am, but seroisly i would never want fluttershy too see that :(
FlareChaser try to make the background slope ^^
A better choice than Watership Down is Felidae
On my Birthday expect a LOT of pictures..... a lot.
Bronysith: if I was going to spend a bunch of time watching anything starwars today, I would be re-watching the Star Wars Begins documentary
Invi: I'm too lazy D:
well watership down is about bunnies murdering each other
lol it's just taking a pic ^^
SSOOO many bronies B-days :D
Felidae is about a human scientist doing experiments on cats
everyone sounded the same in Watership down.
even the seagull.
mfw one VA
watership down is about killer bunnies. y'know! for kids!
lol, limewire.
That_British_Guy why should we click on a link when you say oh god about it?
So no one's heard of Felidae?
Invi: I clicked, it's not as bad as you think
It's not bad at all.
I haven't windwhistler
Invi because im British????
Yayyy!!! Im back everypony! :)
I'm feeling the need to play...something. I'll see you folks later for movie night.

That_British_Guy sure...
ok
Oh good, for a second I thought everyone was just trying to ignore me to make me feel bad.
sup guys
hey RaveBrony what have you been up to
Hey alexxm, ive been getting presents :3
HotS is out?
By the way, I lied about being fine.
alexxm: mixup with payroll deliveries, I asked a co worker working clear across town if they would eventually be at a closer job site, and if it was ok to leave their crew's pay at said jobsite - was ok at first - called back over 2 hours later, guy changed his mind, wanted me to drive back, pick up their checks, drive 90 minutes to their job site near the end of the day
Truth is I feel crappy
My dog has cancer.
happy birthday RaveBrony

RaveBrony: Why dont you give your tablet a whirl and draw your OC?
03I'll copy and paste
alexxm: im doing good even though my computrr died. Hard drive broke. Im using my Kindle Fire to join the streak. And hello, Invi!
FlareChaser: Ive been mesing with it Alot, it is REALLY going to take some getting use to, but i LOVE it :)
Kerrigan?
03OK seriously, what?
03I had one of those "push notifications" from Draw Something (and this is the PAID version, not the free one!) and it had what looked like news headlines... I clicked on it to see what it was about and then I get an email from Google saying my order of 75,000,000 Zynga chips for $99.99 couldn't be processed as my card was declined. (Thank god!)
03The real question... WTF JUST HAPPENED? Is Draw Something (which is now owned by Zynga) making it so if you accidentally click on their spammy news headlines, you get billed for $100?!?!?!?!
Gentlemen's Jack is sweeter with a honeyed flavor, this is bolder, richer in smell & flavor, vanilla with a caramel finish
*computer
you're streaking Sylandest?
Sylandest your hard drive died? why?
RaveBrony: Good...good....mmwahahahahaha

Uakh but only the 1st part + expansion

Rarity's VA was one of the Tachikoma voices in GitS
No zerg rush? i have no idea what that is...

Derpy's in this?
Invi: implied ;P

I'm on FAF IRC right now
CraftCraft?????????
Uakh it needs to be ponified ^^
Heh, ghost in the shell will always be marred by having kari as a tachikoma
Craftception

Crafting within crafting
i just cant forget that scene
Craftception
My god........
craft craft is best craft
Without new episodes of MLP, I've turned to Breaking Bad to see if it's similar.
^^
ITS MINECRAFT 2!!!!!
we craft to craft the crafts within our craft
and Fllay in Gundam Seed....
crafty
OH YOU!
Minicraft 2
they really did do well on their VA choice
00,10lo all
^_^
hey sumica
Sumica!!!!!!!!
oh my!
woot Sumi!
is that a SC2 mod ?
moien Sumica ^^
I don't really get it
and a main character int he new voltron, and a major side character in Ironman: Armored Adventures....
/me doesn't have SC2
O hai Sumica
hi Sumica
She is a voice in alot of mecha shows....
Uakh: Someone made a custom map of Starcraft 2 using the assets and redesigning the game as a resource defense game
Wrek stop scaring your builders
1,3~work complete~
Ion Cannon ready
wait... wrong game
And she voiced Dende in the canadian DBZ dub.....
little wonder these builders keep dying : look at the portrait, they're smoking cigarettes without filters D:
Mind = Blown
/me shoots with confetti gun at kirzstryfe *toot*
and they eat buttery biscuits
00,10so what's the point?
Hello people
Must look up all the others now....
hi RankWinner
heh. So I read the rules of EQD. Yeah, my story won't be able to work there...
point of what Sumica?
Pinkie Pie is also Chi-Chi in DBZ and X23 in Xmen: Evolution....
Sumica uh, having fun? I can't figure out more...
00,10the game mode of SC2 wrek is playing
Fun?
Kill everything?
fun
flutter_spin: too saucy ? :P
the game mode is to survive. It gives a few minutes to setup.
no, brony in Equestria...
what's the problem with that ?
Ello!
They no longer accept them I guess
hi Blue_Leaf
Aw yeah, my temp's gone down to 39C now... improvement over 40C a few hours ago
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid
Wow
Hai Invi!
Wow there are sooo many channels on this site!
AJ/RD is Black Widow in Ironman:AA, and Allura in Voltron Force....and one of the test sisters in johnny test....
They don't accept any human element
No comment on the 24FPS vs 48FPS videos
Hiho Blue_Leaf
crossovers are accepted, but no humans
what about anthropology?
oh, that'
they have changed the rules a couple times
s ponies in human world
I guess there is a new rule sometime after that fanfic was posted
yo CCCP
you can still get it on fimfiction I'd assume
enjoying yourself there?
yeah. fimfiction accepts all sorts of stuff, even mature
EqD is overated anyway
didnt you have work to do
Celestia is Farseer Macha in DoW.....
Wall of turrets!
Shipping, romance.....
I dunno if DHN does fanfics
its loading the pages right now
so I have to wait before I can edit them
I would agree Uakh, I only use them as a news source
ewww
fimfiction accepts almost anything
flutter_spin: porn on EqD is ok. As long as you provide saucy pics of trixie for seth's private use
greetings
hi ezio
heh. Well I go to EQD usually for news updates.
^
what game is this
oh and pics. I like to see drawfriend stuff
might as well go to DHN
Starcaft Craftcraft
fanfics and music I tend to bypass
flutter_spin and comics :)
saucy art is ok, but overly stylized art isn't
Uakh: who is Seth anyway?
i swear, they knew boys were gonna watch and went "quick lets grab all the good boy cartoon female vas make em ponies and watch it grow"
there are few fanfics i read, most of them are old cause all the new ones are overused
CCCP: a kid in arizona who has a spyro fetiche and dropped college to run EqD
most of them are crossovers though
punctuation would of probably helped that
uh oh
Uakh: ohh
1,3EqD has a lot more community updates, but I like DHN better, they fact check before posting news
okay
wow Uakh
who hasn't dropped out of community college to play WoW/Run EQD?
/me has never haerd of DHN
13also DHN posts our movie nights on time
I'm not too familiar with DHN. I guess I should check it out more.
13rather than midway through the B movie
And Tara of course is at least one character in every cartoon, videogame, and anime dub ever.
whats dhn
00,10mostly
lol yeah. I notice that Shiz
whats DHN is it a rival ponieh site?
Shane377|SWAG: don't be like you didn't know >.>
1,3www.derpyhooves.com
DerpyHoovesNews
DHN is like EqD but they fact check and act more profesionnaly
I take it he cannot craft units?
OMG derp haz news!!!!
thanks kirzstryfe
oh god, if tara wanted to take over a country there would be a literal army of fans to help her do it
Gonna take a shower, bbl
thanks kirzstryfe
00,10dat is some angry typeing
People aren't liking my fanfic on fimfiction.net
kirzstryfe: that has barely any derpy
DHN is still a better love story than Twilight
Hello.
I guess I can always hope some brony will read it on stream :P
flutter_spin: happens.
/me shrugs
1,3DHN is run by a group of people, EqD is run by one person
Hoo [one person? Really?]
flutterspin link me the fic i will read it
I've already been told that my chapters are too short....
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid
i thought it was 2 people
kirzstryfe: actually Cereal kinda co-runs it
although it looks like Tabitha has been in more mecha shows than Tara....
13http://i.imgur.com/mizH2.gif
1,3I want one
and Xyro is responsible for the all the streaming part
oh, first 4 are all sethisto
some guy named Calpain posting stuff on EqD
and Phoe
Oh god Shizuka, her eyes are moving
Shizuka dem eyes :'(
13wobble wobble
1,3difference between "run by" and "works for" :p
Shizuka: DAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I guess if Sumica is happy with his appearance in the fanfic, that would be great...
00,10Sorry have had a chance to read it yet, was sleeping
that's ok. I'm about to leave out of town for the weekend
Hiya guys
uh-oh Phoe has gone insane and taken over EqD. Isn't RPing hilarious?
I prob won't be back until Monday
make love NOT war
Yay drawfriend
guys on dhn it said Love is in the air… it’s time to celebrate a royal wedding! My Little Pony – Friendship Is Magic: Royal Pony Wedding is coming to DVD on August 7, 2012 from Shout!
Cereal is busy working at Equestrian Innovations
personally I like Cereal more than Seth
what's with all the cables? addon i missed? or mod?
but that's just my opinion
I like the Hoof board
very useful
00,10that was a deep disapointed sigh
nvm lol

TheHoodyNinja: i own an xbox
DarkSkyes: yes it was
20 million sold? man, the Gamecube failed.
CCCP: Did you ever have a gamecube?
CCCP: wrong ping

Ohi kingqball

we can destroy a city in mere seconds and the fallout can obiliterate all life

dem be now watched FlareChaser
Freefall29: There can be. Shane377|SWAG Yes, north korea can start it...
pony_zen: victory.
well yeah, there CAN, but the world would be like fallout if we did
^Good point
and that would be sweet
That_British_Guy: its gonna be treyarch one so im gonna end up playing it alot more then the infinity ward ones
im going to grab my ncr costume
i just find treyarch ones more balanced and fun
hi everypony, how are ya all doing?
It was actually warm today!
Hiya eeveesprit
Why cant COD make a game where you play a nazi? That would actually be really cool :P
Hey eeveesprit How you doing?
i'm doing great, and how are you doing?
that depends, would the nazi's be portrayed as good guys?
Because Nazis are naughty That_British_Guy
That_British_Guy: could be really offensive
eeveesprit: Well thank you
it would be fun That_British_Guy but offensive
then it would be illegal in germany
Nazis are bad, mkay?
Pfft in this world what is being "Nice" anymore?
Well you could play as the Wehrmacht in WaW multiplayer.
Does that count?
only if you are a allied spy, then it MIGHt work
That_British_Guy: Ponies are nice.
^
That_British_Guy: being nice = not being a dick
COD 10 Call of Duty Uganda
That_british_guy, you do know the nazi's tried to strategically eradicate the jews, right?
XD
oh lord
call of duty in the futute, years ago we laughed
Shane377|SWAG: COD 10 will be in space
lol
Come on, I just finished freakin boy in the striped pajamas. Don't give me more thoughts!
haha technically it already was in space
has anyone seen black ops 2, it looks like they are running out of ideas
remeber in MW2
ramirez!
COD 10 will be in equestria
do a barrel roll!
"the future is black" XD
xD
Freefall29: they complete jumped 30 yrs from all other cods
Everytime I am at BS, I feel like this: http://iambrony.jsmart.web.id/mlp/gif/132057222959.gif Always.
/me does a barrel roll
One of my favorite German exports is Rammstien
Freefall29 well if you look back, not all the nazi actually knew about the camps...so...ya....
CCCP: NOOOO, NOT EQUAESTRIA]
o-o
Freefall29: it was really funny i thought
Shane377|SWAG: i only play MW1
twilight_sprinkle: :3
/me tops his cupcake with some twilight_sprinkle
the elder scrolls VI equestria, that would be cool
pony_zen Me all the time.
Black Ops was great imo
pony_zen, I know that feel
zombies was cool yeah
its gonna be made by treyarch so they shiz will be balanced
So guys....what would have to be your pony name?

eww, raw meat ;A;
Digitalis: :(
/me cries
Freefall29, iz okay
yeah, i worked with it once
hehe I was just playing hun ^^
/me huggles CCCP
Digitalis: i know :3
/me hugs back
brb i iz watching DSP
how can you import a map, I wanna make a animation and use 2fort as a background
/me eats raw meat. and PinkySpice .
/me hugs everypony
ACK!
hmm
*hugs that british guy back*
ITS almost FRIDAY NIGHT
Chrysalis: You up for a game now?
hm i dunno, never tried that freefall
Freefall29, lol, you want import whole MAP on blender? :D what ya smokin' there mate?
/me respawns, and seals twilight_sprinkle within a glass jar for later
That_British_Guy: My pony's name is Steel Quill
Oh, and hi everyone.
otakon: what now
hiya xax
kenne: A game of ME3 are you up for one?
/me casts magic and escapes PinkySpice 's jar
my bad, tab fail
Oh COD Finest Hour *sighs* back when COD was good :'(
Lol
otakon17: lemme finish this match first
I think world at war was the last good cod game
/me proceeds to cast a magic seal and imprisons PinkySpice in a pepper shaker
....what the fuu is goin on here and why di o wanna play?
;A;
mw2 literally was just an upgraded version of mw1
Otakon17: hey whatd you get from the comendation pack
kenne: Okay, I'll play a quick bronze as warmup
That_British_Guy: Black Ops 2 is gonna be set in 2025. It'll be interesting to see how they manage that :l
Freefall29 world at war was an abysmal COD game
Freefall, you make the model, and animation for it in Blender, then you could for one make sequence for it in hammer and with decompiled 2fort and make the whole thing using Source ingame engine, or other possibility is to use n00B methods, like Gmod with custom model you made and animated in blender. Have fun compiling.
with no effort in game balance at all
Battlefeild: bad company > Battlefeild 3
XAX Oh and Woods is alive!?!?!?! HOW!??!?
bad company 2*
CCCP I agree 100%
hi XAX
That_British_Guy: :$
Freefall29, and that was probably worst way to try to explain what I really meant
anyone remember medal of honor?
question why is qrek playing Starcraft 2 dead chat?
That_British_Guy: I havent even played Black ops 1 so I have no idea what so ever.
OMG I LOVE MEDAL OF HONOR
Hi CCCP :)
pony_zen what if I use the models from the game, I have gcfscape, so I can extract the .mdl files all that
Medal of Honor Airborne <3
say, why would I decompile the models anyways
I still got medal of honor allied assault on the PC somewhere
i remember medal of honor,it was one of my first shooter games :)
A valid question
also i cant tell if this is a very well made mod game or not..

RX-78-SweetieBot: :|

So today I've been wondering whethr I should start doing the whole visual kei thing that was slightly popular in the 90s or something.
*whether
So, I got a theory
and look its CCCP
and RX-78-SweetieBot
and Shamroc..
Maybe Equestria is used to the whole "Coming under siege every other week" thing
hi Shamroc
ello
you feeling better today Shamroc?
RX-78-SweetieBot: soooo much more
good to hear
i think i might be a sadist
Perhaps the entirety of Ponykind has been doing this whole "Saving Equestria" thing for as long as it's been around
Everypony has had there own adventure and nopony really bats an eye anymore
Just a theory
Damnit, I killed the chat

07Drake, it's unfortunate that you've never had a Krispy Kreme doughnut before
04...
/me throws a regular glazed KK at Drake
04Yes I have
I hafts go, BMN starts at 7:00 right?
04They are delicious
good
07Wait, do they have KK in Australia?
04They did, until they went out of business.
so kirzstryfe is guild wars 2 good
hey CCCP i got a new chapter in
10How does KK go out of business
Bronysith: great! can i read it later i have to go
well TheGreatAndPowerfulT he talks about it alot so...yeah
10Doughnuts are gooooood
ok see ya CCCP
1,3yes, yes it is :p
04I know, I loved KK doughnuts.
03it's because Homer Simpson moved
03duh
again kirzstryfe if only i had the money i would be playing with you right this moemto
04But I think they just opened too many stores.
07That sucks D=
i want to play it, but i have doubts my laptop might not be powerful enough to play it
07KK is one of the many reasons why I want to visit the States again
03I keep misreading those as KKK and thinking you all are racist.
/me throws a doughnut at drf
PATTAH.
maybe go to Portland
Oregon that is
03oh
03er
do do do do do
13When I see KK I instantly think of the character from Animal Crossing .w.
they have a place called Voodoo Doughnuts
03you'll have to tell me if the stereo balance is better today
03I'll be using my laptop
ok
/me burnt
03and that just has a single soundboard controller
03not two
mooo
03the computer I used last week I had to manually adjust the left and right
03and this week I'm also not going to overdrive it to hell >_>
07More like Tacoma, because that be where my closest Krispy Kremetokeepdrffromhavinganervousbreakdown store is
1,3it actually takes less power than you'd think for a new game
even though I could not tell
AGC FTW!
03yeah, supposedly nobody did
03but I could
unless its crysis lol
03when I played back the 128kbps mp3s that they automatically save
03as air-logs
1,3the options are tweaked so it'll run fine on older systems
03it sounded AWFUKL
03-K
03the music was about 8dB too loud
03and I blame the guy who gave me the station orientation XD
yea because unlike the rest of us you can see the VU meters indicating pre-processing levels
03yeah
03He told me to have the VU meteres in the yellow
03then the station engineer was like "um, no. Never"
Oh good video RQ's are up now
03so I'm gonna have it in the GREEN today
wait waht is goin on here
good idea
Come see me on http://www.lock-freesex.com
Come see me on http://www.lock-freesex.com
Come see me on http://www.lock-freesex.com
even then I can run additional processing
since they have a Winamp link
03XD
I can use either Stereo Tool or Sound Solution
03I'm gonna be using Winamp to play the songs
the second of the two I really like
you might want to keep those in mind
they are Winamp plugins for audio processing
i'll just wait until it can be pirated, try it and then if i can run it i'll buy it
The Doctor wandered into a group of four naked heavies apperently
....whoa now
:V
Stereo Tool is heavily featured but easy to screw up
Quack
ded
Also The Do-DEAD
due to the fact you can set time constants for attack and decay
03eh, I'll just leave it as is
with dance music this will cause pumping artifacts
03but you'll have to tell me if the song More and More sounds good
BROTHER I AM HIT
Ohi Zues
03because I'm gonna do as you suggested
03and not normalize it
where the audio seems to drop in and out
*Zeus
03so the intro is really really quiet
03and then it gets loud after about 30 seconds
ok
03so I won't know if it works out or not
03I guess it's a good test of the AGC
This is very well silly
if it works as well as I think it will your listeners will not know
Hats
...this is well made

Why is there a Blud Rehven

The Doctor clearly knows when shit's gotten to too stupid
I might play the two Disney songs I have back to back
its just Part Of Your World and Under the Sea
Oh Queen, one of the few reasons I am still alive right now
of course from the same movie
26 people and the rooms is still quiet
I take it when the movies turned on people will talk more?
hey gais i maed an oc she's an alicorn called princess serenityharmoniouslight and her special talent is being perfect and also she is the daughter of rainbow dash and pinkie pie and she is cadence's sister
Am I doing it right?
...i guess/
Pinkie Pie is every single woman in Equestrian history, we've been over this
Yes, even Celestia
03alright, well I'm gonna get going
03to make sure I can get in and start on time
03since last week security gave me trouble LOL
Pinkie pie + rainbow dash = a foal called Sweet Rush
ok
03http://www.kettering.edu/current-students/student-life/WKUF is the link for anyone here who wants to listen, there are 3 links on the right side that all do the same thing
oddly enough the movie those two songs are from is the one I am kicking myself over losing
03show should start in 35 minus almost exactly
03if I can get in there alright
Fun fact: Rainbow Dash can impregnate other females
!touhou
Just like how Big Mac can impregnate anypony
StinkomanFan fun fact: unless she is a unicorn no she can't

DAMN YOU FUN RUINER
I WILL HAVE MY DAY

Speaking of Killjoys, where's Meanwhile?

Don't you mean to say... he looks HORRIBLY familiar?

If that's a referance it's not one I know.
nooo
i've become a kitty D:
i love Monty Phyton it always cheer me up
ONCE AGAIN HE BESTS ME
StinkomanFan: hi buddy
Oh goody, it's you
someone needs to watch a certain Sing along blog...
I mean that non-sarcastically

We've got one of the Best Horror Films ever and one of the Worst Horror Films ever up tonight

Pattyrick, you are a 7Hitmonchan.
Tell me for the twenty first time.
The first of which I've never seen
StinkomanFan: I know I'm so PUMPED
07!pokemon
Pattyrick, you are a 4Piplup.
But the question is
which is which?
07Ok fine
I know Troll 2 is more of a comedy than anything :P
Orly.
<Angel_Umbreon> inb4 who dis r <-- haha Jun is becoming predictable :P
OH MY GAWWWWD

That is quite true.

so get out your fava beans, liver, and pop open the Chianti
07and ran into chan, top, and lee
Once again, my fear of Pinkie Pie is exploited for laughs
hmm
This time knowing that she is a lethal weapon
I still say you're weird for fearing Pinkie Pie/
Meanwhile: but everybody love meh
She's awesome.
Let me just say that it's like fearing Batman
I don't get it.
Meanwhile: Are you Drew Barrymore in 50 first dates?
It's like fearing a man dressed like a bat.
eh you don't want to know
not a good movie.
A nigh-unkillable force that WILL find you and punish you for wrongdoings
I prefer the unwubbed version of this song.
Harry Potter pretty much ruined the chances of Troll 3 ever happening.
Except Pinkie
NEVER
...whoa what

Am I the only one curious as to what human liver on a bed of fava beans wth chianti tastes like?
otakon x Derpy
Meanwhile: nope
Meanwhile: no you are not, but I bet it tastes like the usual beef Liver
Maybe.
my face feels scruffy...me gusta
I bet it tastes more like a pig's liver
though I have never had Fava beans or Chianti before
Lies
Lies and slander
Meanwhile, the only man to have ever been arrested of Canniballism says that human flesh tastes like ham
according to teh finale they're magenta or purple or something
i love how all you see before it zooms iin is r34
StinkomanFan: I refuse to believe only one person has ever been arrested for cannibalism.
sends such a good message
Heh
its gettin ther
FlutterJedi: well consider it's dark in that scene, so I'm guessing red it correct
otakon: yeah maybe that's why so many religions ban pork
what song is this

also, mfw I though that was a actual crash
Meanwhile, well the only man ever suggestfully tried for Canniballism in the United States

EspyLacopa: I'm not gonna tell you

SunderlandPony89: i know i was joking
ScootaChicken: I do not want bitches or bastards. If at all possible I want a nice girl who's smart, funny. Tall, buxom, thick of mixed descent between black and asian is my picture of female perfection.
What happens?
StinkomanFan: lol
ScootaChicken: so are most people, and according to your friends, you're a little girl. Therefore, you are a little girl.
CCCP: :P
hmm
Sorry, I'm probably getting a bit excited.

StinkomanFan: well i have to disagree
I need to finish this episode of breaking bad. I hope I'm not missing anything
ScootaChicken: everyone has their "ideal mate" that's just mine
Am I a bad person for considering Lecter an idol?
otakon: Did you not notice the internet sarcasm?
Meanwhile: no.
ScootaChicken: no, it's invisible as always
Meanwhile: nope
the ballance is better this week

GOD DAMN, her accent is like if Applejack and The Engi had a baby and she was raised by Sandy Cheeks
Meanwhile the opposite is true
HERE IT COMES
otakon: Fair enough.
StinkomanFan: lol
I like Jodie Foster
She's a good actress
slightly
StinkomanFan: That was pretty clever actually
i love her accent
also the title stream is behind the actual music
I remember when I first heard a Texan accent in real life.

with fava beans.
ScootaChicken: raw
ive seen it happen before
A Munster
om nom nom
otakon x tongue

i like all the actors in this movie
The best kind of monster. A smart one.
A Munster otakon
Meanwhile: the scariest ones

A human monster is the worst kind
It's the only real kind.

You mean the best?
IDK, Cthulu can be pretty scary

All the women in the audience just creamed themselves
StinkomanFan: lol

I'm imagining ScootaChicken as one of those people on the stream...
It's called a Fear-gasm
05,15It exists
CCCP: Yes. You dont even have to ask

Thank god for that
I don't see you asking why emangamer isn't here.
No colors in here
NONE
ScootaChicken: hes gone for a while
emangamer apparently isn't coming back.
ScootaChicken: well that is what made me think of them when StinkomanFan made that one comment is all.
Idk why, nor do I care.
LC isnt female
I ate otakon's liver with Fava beans and a nice Chiante

that still sucks LordCelestia
CCCP: dont forget to tuck and dance
His personality, the way he speaks, everything about him just bugs me.
How would one "officially leave"?
im not leaving Bronysith
Meanwhile: I think he's awesome
Meanwhile: he's supposed to be "civilised"
otakon: I'm talking about emangamer
Agrees SunderlandPony89.
Meanwhile: who annoys u?
this is b4 movies based on books sucked
agreed*
Meanwhile: oh, he's a friend of mine.
Woop de doo.
Well Meanwhile, hes on skype right now. If you wish I could quote you and share your thoughts about him.
As if your choice in friends somehow affects my opinion that he's a knobhead.
Meanwhile, otakon and I are like the Marx Brothers of the Regular Room
I personally think that emangamer's gotten better as of late.
we are?
Am I Groucho?
ptptptptpptptp
i puked
/me nomz otakon's liver with Fava beans and a nice Chiante
Chianti?
So who is the fourth brother?
THE INFAMOUS ScENE!
k, back
nom
fava beans are nasty
ptptptptptptptpt
emangamer, i will say, was a bit of a suck up for a bit, but hes still a good guy
IshBestPony: I only have one, and you apparently ate it already
wtf is a fava bean?
oh God
I'm assuming Tom is Harpo
YUCK!
maybe he meant java bean
otakon still eating it
dat sperm
..wait no, I mean Chico
The head, that's 20 points!
AGENT STARLING
O_______o
Bah. There have always been horrible movies that were based on books.
^
This.
ScootaChicken: he is
So much this.
Indeed.
ScootaChicken: like discord
Then why does he scare me?
hiya DashWithRainbows what's up man?
You sort of want him to win, even though he's the villain.
StinkomanFan you're scared of Pinkie Pie.
ScootaChicken: charismatic villains
ScootaChicken: how is anyway is he a villain?
ScootaChicken: Good way of putting it. He actually seems like a good guy
Meanwhile PINKIE PIE CAN HUNT YOU THROUGH REALITY
That was, um, disturbing
CCCP: He's ate people
otakon not much, just thinking about stuff. How about yourself?
StinkomanFan: sounds legit.
Aside from his unsatiable love of eating people.
SunderlandPony89: its not a bad idea
PINKIE PIE CAN BREAK INTO PEOPLES HOUSES AND LEAVES THINGS LAYING AROUND
DashWithRainbows: okay, but dammit still no job
There's a scene later in the film when he does a thing which we should see as abhorrent, but you can't help but want to cheer him on.
Not a spoiler.
EspyLacopa people are tsty
Kinda why his cell has no bars, just heavy duty glass.
Boy do I know that feel otakon.
apparently human tastes like pork
StinkomanFan: oh no. She might leave you a cake.
i like to think human tastes of bacon
Chrysalis: u sick fuck
When did he eat them? People were quite tasty before Hight Fructose Corn Syrup among other things.
Chrysalis way to much fat though
ded
LordCelestia tastes of bacon
PINKIE PIE CAN TAKE YOU OUT OF EXISTANCE IF SHE WANTED TO
Chrysalis: no it tastes moar like ham
DAMMIT I NEED TO SEE THE AVENGERS!
CCCP: u sick fuck
But why would she want to?
Chrysalis: I can confirm this.
Not really :(
Meanwhile have you seen Gilda?
02back
Longpork? The other white meat?
Bronysith: i ate a scab once :3
Bronysith x sick fucks
wow, so much hate for the cannibals
She's Pinkie Pie. She isn't the Ponyville Strangler.
wb
ded
CCCP: i eat my skin but not the meat
wow\
Bronysith: the muscle IS the meat
Starling Mallory Archer
PINKIE PIE IS A MONSTER THAT CANNOT BE DEFEATED
StinkomanFan: why All Caps?
THE PINK ONE WILL RULE US ALL
Pinkie the Strangler
molestia>pinkie pie
>Moffet
CCCP: HE'S USING THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE!
mooooooo
May the rats eat your EYES!
SunderlandPony89: but its hurting my ears :(
..im not paying attention to this at all..
hey its james SunderlandPony89
Shamroc: naughty
Bronysith: xD
CCCP: lunaughty?
SunderlandPony89, you find your wife?
Naaaauuuughty
SunderlandPony89: ive never played silent hill 2
StinkomanFan: In a way...
oh, is it naughty tiem
Bronysith: FIX IT! FIX IT NOW!
Get a crowbar?
Good to know
/me wears a hat that over exaggerates where he's from.

Sneaky lady.

http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/89/89097.jpg
otakon: Why is she investigating this building? I missed that part of the conversation
I can feel it coming
She's a wee lassie
wow
SunderlandPony89: Ms. Moffit
I love Jodie Foster
SunderlandPony89: It's a storage place for someone named Moffit, Dr.Lecter clued her in on it.
Thanks
dat owl
inb4 that wasnt in the book
ive never read the book though so idc
Seriously, I don't know what it is about Pinkie Pie but she's just... unsettling
otakon: I was gonna say that
ewww US flah
flag*
Burn it!
StinkomanFan: perhaps it's because you're a giant wuss.
Eeeeew Bri'is' people
GODDAMMIT I MUST SEE THE AVENGERS!
She isn't bound by social norms or physics. Such a being is unsettling
Chrysalis: you lucky bastard
otakon: so go to a cinema.
TELEPOR MARE-IO
/me is slightly unsettling then
i dont get why everyone wants to see Avengers tbh :p
^
just yell AVENGERS! ASSEMBLE!
AVENGERS!
ASSEMBLE!
Hi Aero :3
otakon: so get a bus.
I'll wait till it's on DVD. I don't get into superhero movies
Feh. I continue my crusade of seeing Grave of the Fireflies for the A movie.
Meanwhile: no buses in the country
EspyLacopa: WHY?
Hey
you called?
DOWNFALL FOAR A MOVIE
hi
dayum
Head in a jar!
ow
yummy
shit yo
That's where I left that head...
MY GOD… Marvel's Avengers was awesome
Meanwhile: lol
OH SHI-
dat drawer
Tovler: I so want to see it
SO VERY MUCH
It's a note
well, that's not creepy :P
its a trap!
When it was over I found the nearest public restroom and went for at least a full minute and a half.
Tovler: I heard CA was pretty good actually
Ohey TV
otakon you should see the avengers, its REALLY good
Change the channel to ponies and he'll open like a book
WKUF 94.3 and WAVN 1450 AM stereo
Meanwhile: try drinking 5 liters worth of large Coke and suddenly have to go during the movie XD
Only superhero movie I've loked forward too for a while is Dark Knight Rises, and even that I just expect to enjoy somewhat
eeeeyup StinkomanFan
But Avengers… I always thought "smiling through the whole movie" was some hyperbole.
the second of the two is my low power AM station
Chrysalis: I want to, but dammit I have no transport and no one willing to give me a lift. I get no special transport since I don't work atm
with audio fidelity so good ITS ILLEGAL
I am not joking
Tovler: I've done something like that with WALL-E and Toy STory 3
fucking?
NOW I remember why Pinkie creeps me out, she's always...hhhhhhaaaaappppy
if I were licensed for AM broadcast the FCC would cite me for bandwidth violations
how direct
15 KHz audio instead of 10.6
Ness...nessnessnessnessness
Tovler: Describes my experience with Inglourious Basterds
Drawrings
This and Toy Story 3 were the only times I had real emotions during a movie.
Tovler: what? not for Wall E?
02Well, I'm out
Tovler, I'm the oppisite. I CRY LIKE A BITCH
02Nini everyone~ :3
bye ray
still, Toy Story 3 was friggin fantastic
I FEEL THE HORRORS THE CHARACTORS FEEL
oh dammit the tears THE TEARS!
02Bye Aero :3
cya
I never saw Wall-E in theatres.
Tovler: have you seen it though?
:)
but TS3. :'( I cried.
I was mildly upset during Toy Story 3.
Wall-E that film caused way too much emotion inh me for what it was
I was damned with being born with a Moral Compass
StinkomanFan: same here
I saw Wall-E at a drivein. Yes, those still exist
I LOVE TOM PETTY
ah, suddenly to Memphis
Cursed with the inability to Empathise
I love this scene
I think I almost felt something in Wall-E.
StinkomanFan: I over empathisize
Felt nothing in Up.
Midnight_Fyre pics or it didnt happen
It puts teh lotion on its skin or it gets teh hose again
I liek this song.
Tovler: the first 10 minutes go me
IshBestPony: :3
Wait, no Empathise means To feel Empathy right?
I wonder how much those goggles cost back then
Sorry, I don't document my movie experiences with photos
KITTY
MEW
Midnight_Fyre: it wasn't all photos!
but its a drive in
More than that guy should be able to afford.
dat pussy
its Rarity's CAT!
StinkomanFan: yes, it means to feel empathy
Ok, now if they kill that chick i'll be PISSED
those things are basically like a black+white tv
Probably a few thousand dollars
Ok... I missed like 2 minutes. With my luck that xact part was the most important in the entire movie.
SunderlandPony89: just watched
Spoilers: The Cat is Buffalo Bill
JUST KEEP GOING
null: nope
TIS A TRAP
THINK OF YOUR CAT
and he prays on empathy
StinkomanFan: i knew it!
T'is a very clever trap.
ITS A TRAP
APATHY, That's the word I was looking for!
POOR KITTY :'(
Shows you that kindness is punished in this world
ITS NOT a trap?
I cannot produce apathy
No more owner!
no wait its a trap
StinkomanFan: that means you can't feel what other people do
and here it comes
So what was that note she got?
Avengers… I thought after TDK I'd never see a fun yet good superhero movie again.
No, apathy is a lack of comcern for someone
null: it wasn't a note, it was a towel
*concern
i told you to stay back in the kitchen!
Noooooooo, he left a cat without its owner
Oh :P
/me is now pissed
Herp derp
IshBestPony: IKR! Poor kitty!
THE CAT PLANNED THIS ALL ALONG
buffalo bill is a sick fuck
also >rape
Bronysith: no hes not!
He kinda is.
The thing I hate about movies like this is that they remind me that there really are sick fucks like this out there who kidnap people to do all sorts of sick shit to them
CCCP yes he is
I can has movie role?
NO people do this all the time
Midnight_Fyre: eeyup
Midnight_Fyre: eeeeyup and they take advantage of peoples kindness to get to em
StinkomanFan: You can has no owner because of that sick bastard
CCCP then all the time people are sick fucks
True fact, never underestimate the human ability to be truly monstrous.
IshBestPony: yes
Meanwhile: eeyup
Buffalo Bill is based on a real guy BTW
^
CCCP puts the lotion on CCCP
Doesn't that just chill your blood.
I could believe that
StinkomanFan: seems legit. im seriously convinced
CCCP puts the lotion on CCCPs Skin or CCCP gets the hose
The famous Wisconsin killer
When I go to Youtube, I always wonder how people can write the comments they write.
WOO one of my favorite MJ songs
Ed Gein, naturally
?me heads over to Wikipedia
Tovler: they be trolling
Also the serial killer in psycho is also based off of the real guy
Tovler: Because stupidity
The trick is that they first turn off their brains.
That or that other guy
I forgot his name
/me nomz pierogis
Stalked Teenaged Asians and torcured them
Mostly males

otakon: Just make sure to buy it new. Support the developer and all that
goddammit I'm truly tempted to preorder it now
so okay, I've never seen this before
SunderlandPony89: it's Capcome
*Capcom
lector is in prison, right
they're hunting a different guy
DSNesmith: eeeeyup
otakon: Hmm...
DSNesmith Maaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyybe
serial killers have feelings too!
This movie is one of the rare ones with Two different Villians
SunderlandPony89: but I'm trying to find it somewhere cheaper atm
CCCP: yes but child rapist dont
Actually most serial killers don't.
DSNesmith this will be when my finals do start http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw933_1318831304992438.png
Even Bad men love there mothers
otakon: New or used?
Most of them atleast
StinkomanFan: eeyup
Some serial killers killed their mothers.
CCCP serial killers have problems too, they're just like you, except they're psychotic
StinkomanFan: what if they killed there mother
Meanwhile: sociopaths have feelings too@
SunderlandPony89: either, there is no DLC for it at launch
Hence MOST of them
damn depressing shit
otakon: I C WAT U DID THAR...?
IshBestPony: how do you know im not a serial killer?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: That's me now. I'm taking a much needed break right now from neverending studying
ill be back for ponies
CCCP because ponies
I mean, Micheal Myers killed his mom
The killer not the comedian
IshBestPony: I the brony killer!
CCCP: Because Russians are to cool to be serial killers
anyone else getting slowdown?
Sure just walk into the funeral of some guy you don't know.
nope
otakon x lag
that little girl doesn't look very Jodie-like

The Heavy Disagrees SunderlandPony89
SunderlandPony89: *cough* *cough* thats not true AT ALL
I do so love Jodie though, she's wonderful in just about everything
StinkomanFan: He's not a serial killer, just a merc
/me gives everypony pierogis
dat accent
accent indeed DSNesmith
John Wayne
/me noms perogi's gratefully
I love periogis
Kill more than four people, provoked or not you ARE a serial killer
IshBestPony: i wish i knew what that was..
DAMNIT
shes AJ
/me everypony except otakon
hiya Phase4
eh
Eat cereal, provoked or not you are a cereal killer.
StinkomanFan: What about self-defense
i cant watch stream :(
no periogi?
this laptop can not play it without lag
to be a serial killer you have to kill folks serially
:'( NO PERIOGI!
Shamroc its a polish dumpling filled with mershed perderders
SunderlandPony89 ON FOUR PEOPLE?
dropping a bomb wouldn't make one a serial killer
yummy scene
FOUR PEOPLE?
3
2
IshBestPony: and cheese! fried up with chopped onions and bacon
IshBestPony: and what is a perderders?
1
oops
otakon no onion
StinkomanFan: You're being awfully vague with your definition of a serial killer
IshBestPony: no chopped and fried onion? FOR SHAME!
Shamrocs potatoes,
what's up with their noses?
You commit four homocides you are a serial killer
A serial killer is defined by the number of people they've killed.
IshBestPony..oh netat
otakon IshBestPony hate onions
DSNesmith: The smell I'm guessing
DSNesmith: Vaseline to block the smell
Right, okay
I learned it on an episode of MXC
So all soldiers are serial killers then?
Well, basically all soldiers
otakon unless its in ring or french fried form
Anything above that is just a serial killer who's progressively better at their chosen path in life.
Most of them yes
ScootaChicken: yes, yes they are
oh boy here we go
Not all of them kill 4 people
IshBestPony: finely chopped and fried onions are GREAT with periogis!
let's not get into the anti/pro military shitfest, folks
I wonder if I could kill 4 people and get away with it.
also, CHOPPED AND FRIED BACON!
otakon no onion with mer pierogis, just cheese
Meanwhile: only if it was self defense
IshBestPony: delicious though
http://www.ehow.com/how_5793755_legally-define-serial-killer.html
StinkomanFan: Uhh, dafuq? How does killing in self defense if you're a soldier make you a serial killer?
otakon x pierogis
LOL this song
well iom guessing i missed a lot
Get off on four counts of Self Defense
damn gtg
SEEMS LEGIT
Idk otakon, there's a lot of farmland out here that you could probably bury a corpse in pretty good.
SunderlandPony89: Soldiers kill civilians when they don't need to
/me remembers the dead animal smell.
Meanwhile: yeah maybe
and here comes the creepy bit
/me shudders again
otakon: What if they're other soldiers?
why do they have cok in there nose?
otakon: as opposed to all the other creepy bits?
coke*
DAFUQ?!
2 roaches doing it!
SunderlandPony89, You kill four people OR MORE, you are a serial killer, nevermind the motive
Dat moth.
a chrysalis or cocoon?
otakon puts the lotion on otakon's skin or otakon gets the hose again
StinkomanFan: There's A LOT of serial killers out there then
CCCP: it's probably vaseline or vapor rub to block the smell of decay ing flesh

Welcome to amazing acting Everlasting_Joy!
otakon, we just got through a thunderstorm/tornado warning.
ScootaChicken: it IS true, also how is that young female friend of yours?
Does this movie even have lambs in it?
Howdy Midnight_Fyre!
Everlasting_Joy: We had a nasty thunderstorm last night, you okay?
SunderlandPony89 I could have told you that.

Everlasting_Joy: That storm hit me a few hours ago. There was a tornado 30 miles away
CupcakeWarrior: no it does not, but THIS is the bit about the lambs
ScootaChicken Tis a lie. I'm totally legal.
otakon: She's fine, I'm going for her attractive friend at the moment.
DashWithRainbows: Prove it.

ScootaChicken: lol, but she sounds so cute you should go for her!
ScootaChicken Lemme just grab my ID.

otakon, yep, our town and house are just fine. It seems the twister was small and only lasted a couple of minutes/miles and it seems to not have destroyed it.
I used to own a couple of lambs.
Little bastards ate my bedsheet.
otakon: I've known her for like my whole life, it would be weird and would probably wreck our friendship.

Again, an Ophanage that is run by a church that is also an insane asylum is the scariest possible place

SunderlandPony89: I bet, the twister was in my county, a little too close for comfort.
LOL that combo
ScootaChicken: but a relationship with a friend is basically the next step. It sounds like you two you'd get along.
Everlasting_Joy: It was one county away for me, and thank God it didn't hit my county. I would of shat myself :P
Too Unlimited - No Limit XD

Usually when it's dark, it's not just dark for you. The key to the dark is silence and keen ears.
O_____________o
02you, Aurora, NS, drf and HML never use it
05,151991
The one with the guy setting another guy on fire while he's in a wheelchair?
This was 1979?
he was getting his gun to shoot her with
fluttercry: oh damn, I thought it was older than that
otakon: 1979?
02and Skylands can't
lolwut

otakon: but we wub u :(
otakon x buffalo bill's corpse

otakon X kitchen sink getting shipped
IshBestPony: sherpers?
and she KEEPS the dog
otakon x sterp sherperng mer
I really want to see otakon become a mod
02well yeah
Here's the scary part StinkomanFan. He's a human being.
shippers x otakon
/me wonders how much a human skin purse goes for on the black market.
02not everyone can like the same things
6I actually get irritated when my name shows up on that script
02:P
otakon X buffalo bills victoms
ScootaChicken: I want to be a mod
purely because he'll probably end up banning like half the chat
Indeed.
6it's not as bad as the force ownership script that whoever had
otakon x berferler berl
off to bed night
Tovler: only a couple hundred I'm sure, human skin is VERY available
SunderlandPony89: Who knows.
6night
Meanwhile, the only good thing about human killers are that they can be killed
lol, Bieber Pelt.
nice cake
otakon: I'm screencapping that last message.
That cake looks delicious
Id rather deal with chrysallis then buffalo bill
Stupid cake :[
Gotta love cake.
otakon: uh, where can I obtain it then?
Anyone else want cake?
02I would say NS but I don't want to hear any jokes :P
I only like Red cakes
Bronysith I'll take the opposite of what you said.
Why do you think I was clinging to her Bronysith?
er mers Lyra
mmm. Red velvet pancakes
02she gave it to someone though
Guess who.
I mers Lyra too
6I know I tend to get upset at irrational things
:O
6shipping and ownership scripts are two of them
0,14say wha
6mainly because I don't like my name being brought up
...and then the sequals SUCKED
07also cuz eons are the only things worth owning
/me runs
02but you like using the !Espeon script
What a magnificent bastard.
I wouldn't say they sucked.
Red Dragon foar A movie
wow
way to ruin her day
07cuz he was first lol
They definitely weren't as good, but sequels rarely are.
Red Dragon was a prequal
HIM
ScootaChicken: He's the definition of a magnificant bastard
not a sequal
6the espeon script has been around probably 3 times as long as you have
he didn't hang up the phone right?
Red Dragon foar A movie
Meanwhile: or in case of star wars PREQUELS lol
6and he WILLINGLY has it here
in a weird way.
released, anyway
6there was a time where kyu "owned" me and i asked him to stop cuz it was annoying
02I don't have a real ownership script :D
I thought Manhunter was 80s
And it ends
delicious dominicans
Well

6!l4d is just fun on a rare occasion
Aurora, You are a 14Smoker.
Pinkie = Buffalo Bill in this movie :3
6reason being, so small pool of names
Y'know, I remember when Stephen Fry came to our school for the end of year awards ceremony.

07I didn't even know that existed lol
I'ma go let my lappy cool off

0,14no way
Ya way.
That award is permanently upon my wall.

SaxyPretender: are you mocking me because i said soothing

SaxyPretender: I'll give you them in return for your jacket.

This is one of my favorite episodes with Pinkie in it.
Meanwhile: she's doing it only because she wants friends and doesn't know how to make them.
That's fanon bullshit
Meanwhile: nope
0,14it is
Um, yes.
Meanwhile: its true, look it up in the dictonary
Her character portrays no feeling of loneliness whatsoever, she just wants to look better than everyone else.
Because she's a prick.
You know what's weird?
Which makes sense because she was designed purely to be a prick and nothing else. :)
Exactly.
My little brothers prefer the CMC to the Mane Six
omg my brother does not know how to do a limit break in ff7
Not the bees. There, I saved y'all that problem.
Not the not the bees!
Meanwhile: thats beacuse she is really good at hinding it
http://derpy.me/Dld3X what has the President done to my country?
CCCP: hiding WHAT. There's nothing there to hide! she's a one dimensional douchebag who only exists to be an obnoxious bitch.
Crush Kill Destroy Swag
So that's not cheating?

And I simply cannot handle obnoxious arrogant stuck up douchebags.
Meanwhile so you have no mirrors in your house?
Like a missle.

Chrysalis: actually I hate mirrors.
Who are these two idiots bickering about?
Is it Gilda?
"I know I am just a little girl, and have no knowledge of warfare"
heh
Bronysith not just pony curious people, everyone
yes IshBestPony
i mean EEEEEEEYUP IshBestPony
Meanwhile: mabey thats what the writers wanted her to be, just a steriotype. But even the most assholish of people deserve to be happy. Their people/ponies too. but what ever i know u will still hate her
0,14face, meet palm
0,14palm, meet face
Fifteen years later ponies have taken over the earth
CCCP: she deserves to be thrown in a fire.
I believe you've met before
Bronysith puts the lotion on Bronysith's skin or else Bronysith gets the hose again
SaxyPretender: what is this "Palm" you speak of
strong words.
/me force shocks IshBestPony
0,14it's a palm tree :3
That's called karma, or equality, or whatever. If you are a prick, you deserve unhappiness.
Meanwhile: now thats not nice at all, no one deserves that :s
That is how the world should work.
/me dodges
Meanwhile x Trixie
I love Pinkie hitting the basket as she calls the hits.
i have no idea whats going on so heres a cute pic of lyra http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3405/
wow, Meanwhile. So you should be punished for every bad thing you've ever done? That's a bit silly.
The world should not sit idly and allow it's naughty children to get away without so much as a tap on the wrist.
TROLLESTIA
MORAL OF THE STORY: TO WIN FOOT RACES: READ BOOKS
suddenly Celestia
Meanwhile: but everyone is a prick, sum just act like their one when there alone or hve no supervision. Others show it.
what are you InSayan?
The fact that I want her thrown in a blender is mainly because I hate her at the very core, but even so she doesn't deserve anyone's affection.
IshBestPony: yehes. PBBBBBBT
I'm going to fight you
Meanwhile: that is too mean
Who Meanwhile? Is it Trixie? Gilda?
thus began APPLEDASH
and then everypony came
And then I'm going to kill you
Troll 2!!!!!
Until you are dead
Today
Nooooooooooo(?)
CCCP: you're right, everyone is a prick to varying degree. And sadly the world does not automatically bring about karma like I wish it would, which is why society has to do it.
IshBestPony: What are you insayian?!

Ah yes, the new intermission

Ooooo! New and fancy intermission!

SaxyPretender is our 80s man.
BLAME CARLO !
SaxyPretender: oh my bad :/
Saxy is so goddamn saxy.
/me is strangely reminded of Toy Soldiers: Cold War from this music
I just heard a guitar and made an assumption
and then SaxyPretender became Saxy80s
SunderlandPony89: i like that game

CCCP: it's a high hat and blood

That kid looks like Micheal J Fox.
since putting Schindler's Lis for A does not seem tro work i'm going to put Pokémon: The First Movie for A
it's amazing
Damnit son! Who's telling the story here!
otakon: but its really fake looking
CCCP: I'm OK at the game, but it still doesn't get in the way of me playing the game :)
Still better than the acting in the Bunnyman movie
If someone approched me with that face (the freckles) I'd run, even if my legs were hacked off.
But dad... I DONT CARE
TheGreatAndPowerfulT iv been voting that for a the last 4 weeks
THEY ARE STILL OUT THERE!
SunderlandPony89: same
bunnyman movie was funny though

They're eating her, and they're going to eat me next, OH MAI GAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWDDDDD!!!
Gampa Seth
This is funnier than bunnyman movie
Green... the color of kirz
Goblins guys.

NOMNOMNOM
And then they're gonna eat me!
Chrysalis the chances have been doubled
Oh my goooooooooooooooood.

its funny how there are no Trolls in it! :D
yfw there is a TROLL 3
CCCP: yeah
My GOD this movie is terrible
otakon I thought they were making that
otakon x trolls
Aren't there two Troll 3's otakon?
SunderlandPony89: the third one is worse
Jonathon's craaaaazy
Everlasting_Joy: I don't remember
otakon x goblins
Oh wait, no they're making Troll 2 Pt. 2
otakon: HOW?! How did the movie studio get the money to make a third one?!
Everlasting_Joy: according to James Rolf
'And for me, his daughter'
dat exposition
CCCP good point.
SunderlandPony89, actually none of the Troll films are made by the same studios
"I'm reading my lines very calmly"
They just bought the rights
"is this good, mr. director"
StinkomanFan: Then why would ANYONE want to continue this terrible series?!
"oh, excellent. I'll continue acting then."
there are so many capitalist ads in his fucking room :[
incoming 80s
And even then they have little to do with eachother
ah this this chick
.... as opposed to socialist ads? that's just called propaganda.
DSNesmith: :|
that is fanservice dammit
This must be the Human 80's Cheerilee

Meanwhile: I can't tell if it's bitchiness or just something lost in the bad acting
SaxyPretender: You and me, in the woods.
The line scans
/me is laughing his ass off at this "acting"
this movie, man
SunderlandPony89: I like Kirika though, she's 6'2" wears no panties and has a 98cm bust with about 3 feet of purple hair. and she has a oral fixation.
she wants to fuck
otakon: wut

So far this isnt funny bad, its just bad.
suddenly actual music
Fun Fact: The actor playing the dad made a documentary called Best Worst Movie which is about the making of this movie and the people involved
The dad is in just as much pain as we are :D
Anyways, brain is shutting down. I honestly cannot watch this at 2:47 in the morning. G'night regulars room.
ScootaTro-Goblin: 6'2" chick with 98cm bust, wears no panties and a short skirt, extremely flirtacious with purple hair in a ponytail at about 3 feet long. She also has a oral fixation and loves chocolate covered bananas.
RX-78-SweetieBot: i think its amazing
no, Midnight_Fyre, the guy that made the movie was the kid playing Joshua
night Meanwhile take care see you tomorrow

StinkomanFan The dad is there? Here I thought it was some sort of robot.
otakon: what the fuck

I'm Pretty sure it was the dad
It's the OMG kid
Sleep well Meanwhile
nope

otakon x the chick he just described
the dad was interviewed for it
0,14later Meanwhile
but the kid made it
he's like 25 now
ScootaTro-Goblin: like I said, the epitome of fanservice, just one square inch of covering short of real nudity
Sweat
inb4 scary part
Chrysalis: she's too damn wild, her personality is that of a flirt
dat wide angle lense
*lens
otakon: How... how would anyone find a chick like that the least bit attractive?
The dad give no fucks
SunderlandPony89 I haven't a clue.
SunderlandPony89: I like tall women.
you ate TOOOOOO MUCH
to be eaten
I guess it was the kid, but it features the dad a lot
This is what happens when you touch yourself kid
or to beaten
Everlasting_Joy: I'm refering to the Eiken chicks, btw

oh god lol
IS THIS THE REAL LIFE?
David after Dentist
SunderlandPony89: do not underestimate otakon's love of the boobage.
http://images.wikia.com/eiken/images/7/74/KirikaProfile.gif SunderlandPony89 that's her, actually her bust is SMALLER then the largest girls.
Ohi Grampa
I always wake up from bad dreams screaming about what I was dreaming about :P
otakon: I mean the Eiken chick btw. Probably should of made that clear
If I recall right, most of the bad acting is due to bad directing.
Bad acting is from bad acting
Hi there grandpa hobo
Everlasting_Joy: the director didn't speak englidh
english*
Chiharu gets a bust of 132cm by the end of the series, and Komoe has a 122cm bust at 13 weighing 101lbs.
and I'm a ghost!
I think the Director was foreign and didn't know the first thing about what English is supposed to sound like
Way back when they could afford to back u[

I'd be willing to BET
Yes, because when tricking people it is always a good idea to leave creepy warnings
I'd be willing to ACT
DINKLEBURG
So apparenly this film was created as a way for the director's wife to express her annoyance at her friends becoming vegetarian.
typical country hos-pit-ality
lol
lawl here it comes
I could believe that
oh yeah, I completely trust a meal that is GREEN
/me is having The Avengers withdrawl much like how those… people wanted to live in Avatar land.
Green is clearly the color of donuts
I would NOT eat that dammit
She said, and I quote 'Some of my friends had recently become vegetarians... and that pissed me off'
I'm to piss on hospitality.

DSNesmith: well at least shes not rolling her eyes every other scentence
"Don't mind me, I was just shot with a spear"
DSNesmith I think it's some kind of staining.
I'd rather have overacting than... whatever the rest of them are doing
I reckon that kid with the glasses is one Fortunate Son.
no those are braces
she's defnitely wearing braces

otakon: Soccer moms, remember

SunderlandPony89: yes it was it was one of my favorites

Rarity

otakon: People need to just gain back their common sense
This scene and Cadance singing in the cave: two saddest scenes in FiM

PCCC: She is and that's why I <3 her!
Randomnerd: :3

and the must MISUSED SOUNDCLIP EVER!
most
reasonable demands!
i was watching a movie is school and it had the squee sound in it
I love Rarity
element of generosity is thinking about herself
what a disgusting metaphor
time for awesomeness
Dinky and Sparkler <3.
dat bandana
lol the hair bump
perfect
Just because someone is generous doesn't mean they dont have to care about them selves
^
ONE. DAY.
iknowwhereyoulive
THANKS BULLHORN FACE!
this season really made me love granny smith
not just her focus episode either
^
Ow.
i feel like this show takes place in a weird alternate universe during the industrial revolution
dem blue eyes
Hi Derpy!
yeah the tech level is great
that's some mighty persistent mud
PCCC: I'm confused on the level of technology in Equestria. No modern weapons, but they have a modern hospital. SO CONFUSING
11,02otakon: I don't have a sneaky face D:
PCCC: the tents and flags and stuff all over the place always make me feel like it's a cross between modern day and the Renaissance
I'm loving this music
SunderlandPony89: IKR
aw
I always hope they'll win
Midnight_Fyre: it could be, but many of the machines they have seem turn of the century
dat horn
:o
SuperBrony64: I said SB.........wait that pings you
WAHAHA
FABULOSITY!
SWAG
man, she can hold her breath a long time
and then THE SPA!
PCCC: Then again, the ancient equipment the Canterlot Royal Guard used could of been just for show
they cheated
PCCC: a lot do, but then a lot also seem really modern. It's like a weird amalgamation of time periods
they've got magic, why would they bother with gunpowder
most modern thing is manehatten
SunderlandPony89: ya it could have been
Who knows, but we know they have bullets and cannons
I like how spike's just randomly in Rarity's house
Midnight_Fyre: i guess
inb4 wet mane spam
DSNesmith: He's there to scope her house out so he knows where to sneak in.
But New York was around in the industrial revolution
I gotta send an email to DHX and ask them to show the level of technology Equestria gas
We realy need to see the tech level of a large city better to have an idea of the overall tech level.
Show, tell, whatever :P
considering canterlot is the captiol
A small town isnt going to have all the latest tech
I'd say it's an average tech level
awwwwww this made me cry :')
and canterlot is heavily magic
True, I'd like to see more of Manehattan
with some fancy medieval style buildings, of course
thanks DSNesmith *hugs*
y'welcome
it's one of my favs
now we just need to get Owl's Well shown in here
instead of Party of One for the zillionth time
0,14like during the summer
0,14XD
The Avengers was so good, it made me hate the Nolan batman movies.
0,14o_o
Yes, the technology seems like it's from all over the 20th century and the architecture seems Medieval/Renaissance
-.o
I would like the final to be streamed again
right well I'm off for the night, cya folks
Well then it's time for me to head out. Night guys!
Ive seen it 12 times now
0,14later DSNesmith and SunderlandPony89

+n added
05,15they police the network. and stalk you when you make harem jokes <.< >.>
0,5all better?
fluttercry: o_o stalk me?:D
or is this channel supposed to be secret?
0,5Not at all
yesh it is MakerDusk
oh..nvm then
0,5Why would it be secret?
>_<
13because it's for regulars
13z
0,5Doesn't make it secret
well it makes it more selective
were there any other modes set?
05,15It's supposed to not show up on the /list
I dont believe so...
yay
no colours XD
wat
derp/
lol
So many @'s.
XD
0,5:I

lol
MakerDusk: wry you so helpful..

0,5Not really RBD
I forgot XD
/me 11,01makes MakerDusk
LordCelestia: Oh, alright then.
want me just to get it now, LordCelestia?
05,15Remember just never imply that MakerDusk has a harem, or it will end badly and you'll be watching your back for days
11,01I'm bored, so expect me to do random things.
ka-boooooom
fluttercry: Is it one of those trneds that I must watch out for or what not? I may make that mistake in the future..:D
done
what if we imply he is IN a harem?
well, fluttercry got this stalker
who was like really pissed
uhuh
05,15It was ajoke! ;___;
A joke=stalker in the future, a valuable lesson to be learned Twilight.
lol
/me takes notes.
Twi_Fi: Take a lot of notes on Chapter 10, stalkers and predators.:D
so LordCelestia...chat is now just dead...and not dead nad broke
I take it someone was being a wiseass?
What now?
h,,?
What chat is dead?
hmm8
Huh?
Twi_Fi...pretty darn dead
I think they ment this chat, BSR.
infact..i kileld it not to long ago
you call this dead?
Dken2021 /sarcasm
We can always start it back up ya know.
That sarcasm....
When I'm on here, it's usually me talking to myself.
INTERNET SARCASM! the way to be a complete ass without realizing it
0,5Excellent
eyup
^_^
0,5Welp
0,5all that would have been unneccesary if I had typed in the right command >_<
when if doubt, have an admin do it XD
^
0,5Im usually so good at it too. :I
LordCelestia....its ok..i found this a fun experiance
we're also skilled enough to fix things
MakerDusk: Prefect solution!:D
God, I hate it when you can't spell correctly.
you wouldn't believe how many "I locked myself out of my own channel"s we get XD
Really? Jeez.
well at least its not as bad as what my problem was MakerDusk..i tried it 93 times and failed
MakerDusk: Just like "Hey, I locked myself out of the car, get my keys please! They're outside of the door, and I can't reach it!":D
I suppose it's like locking yourself out of your car.
^
lol
more like putting superglue in the locks, and then wondering why they can't get in like normal
the mode is even S
....lol
So what are the worse problems guys?
...moo
moooooooooooo
Toast?
fudge
Fudgetoast.
:O

Yay!:)
What do I get for winning?
UMMMMM >.>

<_<
>_>
Umm, thanks?
I thought I heard mooing.
your welcome?
(noms on banada, slowly at suspecion to MahBoi777)
(banana, whatever:D)
MahBoi777, this regular room "hi" is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
:P
hey Everlasting_Joy!
... Everlasting_Joy....even i dont understand that
Shamroc it's a running gag amongst MahBoi777 and I, and that stems from this. . .
YES
Everlasting_Joy....what
tis tradition
Shamroc: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny1G0DNx1_M
yep i could watch that 20 times and not understand it
ded
Wat anime is this
0,5So here's a question.
i await
?
0,5Why do you (or some of you) feel this place should be "secret"?
tell the world
Well...
Fuck, umm...I do not think it should be.
i don't but it would get too spammy to read if it was just another room i guess
night Jaketehsnake
...well LordCelestia. didnt you make the channel so a small group of regulars could chat in..a relaxed inviroment
enviroment*
0,5Yes, but I never made it to be some secret hideout.
It's still nice though.
LordCelestia: Like of such for getting in by PM invitations and all that?
0,5People can get in here however they like.
By breaking in.
Alright then....
0,5People take this palce as some kind of secret treehouse
0,5or something
/me likes trees.
0,5Sure, we dont go telling people
0,5but if someone makes it in we arent gonna freak out
yeah...well otakon freaked out when i first got in lol
I beg to differ, and not me specifically.
0,5Pff
0,5Otakon freaks out over everything
Shamroc same lol
soooo we shud tell moar people right?
Hahaha:D
So true!
0,5You make a few (hundred) racist jokes and he gets all mad
0,5pffff
0,5Well, no
0,5Dont tell more people
LordCelestia.. and the 4 or 5 shippings
I remember one night, some folks got in, and a couple folks told them to get out and what not.
how rude
How sad...
0,5You know what
0,5Do whatever you like
0,5Just dont go advertising this channel, because it's against our rules of coursew
okay
Hey, I have yet to advertize this, as a matter of fact, I have no plans on.
this channel, I should specify this channel.
Yeah, never thought of advertising LordCelestia untio you told me not to.:P
(until)
I only get on dis channel on fridays
^
0,5Original purpose of channel: Place with slower chat than mane
0,5Not a secret bunker
0,5Ok?
Yeah, only 27 ponies here.
yessir
Compared to of 146 in mane chat.
There were 44 here during the show TheRainbowDash.
As of right now Everlasting_Joy, and even then, 44 is not a lot.
As to of nearly 300 in mane chat at that time.
Right, I'm just stating the population has been cut in half since then.
I missed movie night....
me too TT_TT
didnt miss much
Twi_Fi: Awww...
Silence of the Lambs be freaky
I missed the A movie and the first pony episode, but I'm free all day today(Saturday), so I'll fullt attend Euro Movie Night to catch up on that.
(fully)
0,5Heh
0,5I remember before I was even a mod
Not sure if I'll be around for Euro movie night.
0,5and I was excited to have even over 10 people in here
LordCelestia: What ancient time was that now?:D
lol
Let us dig up some fossils then!
0,5@ TheRainbowDash, a few months to be precise
0,5Became mod in January
LordCelestia: Oh, well, I joined here exactly on March 17th, 2012, so that is about 2 months before I joined, not too far timepsna.
(timespan)
That exact date!
Twi_Fi: It was the day of the preimere for the episode, "Dragon Quest".
Ahhhhhh
And I did not what the hay was I doing...
I can't remember when I first came on here.
I posted explicit stuff, and did break some rules, because I was so derp at that time, well, not saying that I am not today.:D
The first time I actually said anything during chat was the Hearthswarming Eve episode.
I was there.
Dat explicit stuff.
i actually found this room throug the list command
I came here in October, I remember Wrek was drawing something
0,5This is also my first season drought
I found this room from the channel list before.
Twi_Fi: Yeah, on my first day, posted the story "Cupcakes" on the MANE chat...so fucking derp.:D
0,5I became a brony a bit over a month before S2 started.
I became a brony on Sept. 13th 2011.
LordCelestia, about the same for me too.
I was literally almost banned on the first day here.
i found out about the room when otakon said somthing bout it in mane chat...i pestered him and kirzstyfe ended up giving me the room info..
0,5By the time I actually sat through every episode, S2 was only a few weeks away
i became a brony around ep 12 i think
LordCelestia really? I thought all the mods were S1 vets
0,5Nah
0,5Everyone is different
Yeah, SuperBrony64 joined at the preimere of season 2, with Nittany_Discord and what not.
0,5No need to thank him
0,5It's a bot
all the cons
dari-bot does not take thank you cards.
no BUCK updates :(
11,01Staff?
A'ight, I need to go to bed. Thanks for the great night, like always guys :).
0,5Automatically does that every new EQD post
11,01I joined staff in January.

hi.
hi Bjornfot
movie should of started by now
You should say thanks when he's actually around.
I must know!
Where is the wind?
I dunno.
There's your answer.
:(
:'(
....sooo im back
wb
So, I wasn't here yesterday... is dis any gud?
Hey all.
hiya Randomnerd m
Hey Randomnerd.
Allo Randomnerd.
Bjornfot: Have you never seen Silence of the Lambs?
Silence of the lambs?
Silence of the Lambs!
Meanwhile: probably not?
Well then you suck.
It's awesome.
:)
lol
Let's get out of creepytown
k
hello clarissssse
You look good enough to eat.
Baltimore is a terrible place to live.
It is?
It has very bad crime rates.
oh
People there are actually very friendly, but so many parts of the city are dangerous.
Towson, just to the North, is a college town.
Randomnerd: yeah that matches my experience too
why Meanwhile why http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/191/
Shaddup
lol
What Migs was referring to was probably Fells Point -a gentrified area, or The Inner Harbor, which may not have been well-developed at the time of this production.
Meanwhile, I am disappoint.
Inner Harbor of "Ballimer" = Times Square of NYC.
Not Migs, the idiot administrator, I mean.
....i just did somthing im possibly going to regret for the rest of my life..
?
?
What's up?
...well i think i just embraced a religion without attempting too..
Huh
molestia http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2689/
Shamroc: as you do.
molestia is best lestia
Meanwhile...hmm? i dont understand
I don't understand anything here.
Shamroc: If you're worried, you can Talk to your clergyman
Shamroc: it's just a sort of acknowledgement of what you said.
Randomnerd...thats the thing...this is literaly the first...of any kind of religion i've talked about in a serious manner
I'm an Athiest, I might be the best person to talk to about this?
Might not, rather lol
What religion?
Bjornfot..not completly sure...thats why im freaking..
As if it matters, all religions are basically the same with the only difference being in the fine print.
That's true.
the idea of religion. anyway
at least western religions
eastern religions are quite different, take Buddhism for example
Randomnerd...I'm not an Athiest...i just had no major religion..
I love how Lecter has all the answers.
Well, he IS brilliant.
The only other thing I've seen this guy in is "Moby Dick" as Starbuck.
Dear Princess Celestia: Today I learned not to help anyone!
Randomnerd: your faithful student twilight sparkle
Ew.
Gah :(
did i miss buffalo bills dance?
CCCP: Oh, no. Not yet.
That isn't for like, an hour.
ok
You think Jodie Foster will like the way I mowed mylawn?
Bronystate for ladies.
Randomnerd: do you think she'll like the way I killed Reagan for her?
Hehehe
Serious. Jodie Foster in that room full of troopers.
Jodie Foster = AJ

/me goes into hiding.
Trolls 2 is terrible
Glad I'm not watching it
Yes, yes it is.
/me actually owns it
/me bonks LunaTheBeloved's knee on the floor.
/me cries out in pain and falls over
/me steals Meanwhile's leg
http://derpy.me/kMZyE
what the ef that wasn't nice
/me holds himself up with LunaTheBeloved's leg
/me cuts off one of Meanwhile's toes
/me screeches.
is he holding a mug of coffee?
That was uncalled for!
You started it
grab the pot!
/me brands LunaTheBeloved's leg.
AHHHH
you 2 are to violent..
that'll bever come off!
the acting in this movie is very.... wooden
*nevee
Like my toe will ever grow back!
Hoo hoo hoo
**never
I will cut another one....
OH MI CHAAAAAAAEL
You want me to barbeque your leg? Silence of the Lambs was up earlier remember.
I've never seen it
There's a dude in it who eats people.
Ah.....okay..
Btw...what did you brand in my leg?
Urgh, I'm not sure.
"Remember, GW2 alpha testers are locked in a room with only GW2 for weeks on end, with the skin of a flayed sylvari as a blanket and only a charr plushie to rest their heads on."
/me inspects his branding iron.
The symbol for infinity apparently.
Great.......
Inifinte woona
infinite*
Well it could be worse.
Yeah....brb
Meanwhile: NO NEVER SAY THAT WHAT
Back
hi LunaTheBeloved
ooh sammiches
hai LTB again
Wb.
Thanks
best scene ever
A seance? Get Nancy Reagan!
The best scene is when the kid pees on the food
i like this one moar
And the dad talks to him afterwards
but that was hilarious
LunaTheBeloved: I only recall that vaguely. The line "OH MY GOOOOOOOD" sorta eclipsed it in my brain.
I WON'T ALLOW IT!
Heheh
I bet Mane chat exploded at the "OH MY GOOOOOOOOD"
You have no idea.
somewhat, until +m happened
They're saying OH MY GOOOOOOOD. And I'm saying OH MY GOOOOOOD! We're all saying OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOD!
Yeah for like ten seconds.
AFTER all the spam.
They +m it during the movie?
Wow....
yup
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1464/
Hey gu-OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
You think the actors in this movie, while acting, thought "This movie is gonna be terrible?
/me whacks ScootaChicken with LunaTheBeloved's leg.
Probably.
Ow!
/me stubs one of Meanwhile's toes
Apparently the director/writer wasn't fluent in English
OW.
and insisted that the actors read the script verbatim
/me also hugs ScootaChicken
That's umpossible!
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved
Cello
Haider ^_^
ohai ScootaChicken
Sorry, that wasn't supposed to clonk you.
Allo ScootaChicken.
G'day
/me massages LunaTheBeloved's foot.
oh wow
the synthpop is amazing
/me heals Meanwhile's leg
This is the most 80s thing that wasn't made in the 80s that I've ever seen
oh hey LunaTheBeloved i got a new chapter done and finishing up another one lol
ScootaChicken: THIS WASN'T THE 80s?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1464/
when was it made early 90s?
So people were probably still recovering from the shock of the 80s
ew get outta my decade you lousy movie
This was made in a cave with a box of scraps.
Cello TGAPT
And not by Tony Stark.
hi, good afternon everyone
This IS a funny movie no one can deny that
Also, saw the Avengers last night
And Nirvana hadn't released Nevermind at this point, so the 90s was still kind of... 80s
Insane
LunaTheBeloved: I SAW THAT TODAY
WITH A BUNCH OF BRONIES
ScootaChicken: ooh nice marker
WAS AMAZING
It was great
90's: Nevermind to 9/11
My friends and I wore SuperHero masks
I probably won't see The Avengers.
Meanwhile: lol why not?
Meanwhile: according to midnight it was really good
Oh heroes that WERENT in the movie
Because I'm not really interested.
well ok but what if it's reeeeally good?
I went as Batman
LunaTheBeloved: have u read my fanfic yet
I won't make any effort to see it, but it might drift into view at some time.
LunaTheBeloved: Pfft, that isn't even Marvel. *nerdspex*
Brb guys
Theres a small part of me that is going insane at the idea of someone going to a marvel movie as a DC character
a very small part
a bunch of friends went to see the avengers and were asking in line if that was the line to see twilight
lol
I'm a total noob about comic lore.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ha
I was actually surprised that Spider Man wasn't in that film.
I was later informed of my noobyness.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Hahaha! :D
ScootaChicken: thats because Sony owns spiderman's movie rights still
i wanted to go, sadly was busy that day
The dad in this movie is awesome
was spiderman ever part of the avengers?
If sony would have let it expire instead of making this rebooted spiderman movie, then we could see spiderman in the avengers
Dken2021: yup!
dat Great and powerful Meanwhile in mane lol
Briefly.
ah
Dude, nearly every marvel hero has been part of the avengers at some point
ScootaChicken: the grandpa is better
they still collab occasionally
RX-78-SweetieBot: Was Spider Man in the Avengers according to Marvel lore?
Yes
at least once
CCCP: Actually, I think my favourite character is the kid with the glasses
Y'know, of OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOD fame
ScootaChicken I think he was in the New Avengers
IshBestPony I think I want that as a shirt
ScootaChicken: the "OH MY GOD" kid?
Dken2021 I think I want you
CCCP: indeed
he is awesome
O_O
/me licks Dken2021
IshBestPony: I don't blame you. Dken2021 is pretty damn sexy.
/me is licked -_-
Basically the only marvel heroes that dont join the avengers at some point are ones on other planets, and X-men
Wait wut
let's have a bronystateregulars orgy!
THE CHOLESTEROL
...
lets not
well I'm already undressed
so this is awkward
Goblins eat vegetable matter, quick! GM crops!

I like it too

#brony has some cool people there, although some of them are a bit weird...
some?
Weeeee Preview for the next part of Turnabout Storm
#brony is like a little slice of 4chan's /mlp/
a good slice
A green slice.
what about #boner Im fairly sure there is a channel with that name
rofl
And then when meanwhile got home to trixie tonight, she gave him a slice of green pie
greeeeeen
batman
what if Meanwhile IS trixie?
>_>
<_<
O_O
No.
/me scrunchyface.
Wont stop the shipping
what if he's related to trixie?
:o
That will increase the shipping
inbred pony children
Ew no.
-_-
im sorry
even i think that's weird
...all the green
CCCP: new chapter is up
Well that film sucked.
Bronysith: really? link
Meanwhile: no it didn't
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23903/The-Force-of-Friendship
Yes. It did.
thanks
for once we agree on something Meanwhile
lol lyra is watching you clop
Meanwhile: it sucked for what it was trying to be
It sucked in general.
there are many movies that are hillariously bad. this was just bad.
Bad acting bad plot bad setting bad effects badbadbadbadbad OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD bad.
like I said before
Bad.
9/10. So bad in every single way that it manages to become incredible.
the plot was CORNY the acting was WOODEN and the dialogue was PISS
Bad.
The fact that a film can be this bad is an accomplishment.
it's good bad movie night material
i give it a 8/10 funny but horrible
horrible but hilarious
Bad.
And now pony. :)
Meanwhile: worse than trixie?
It's about even.
fun fact: if you look closely at the skull on the moth in the poster for Silence of the Lambs, you can see that it's made of naked people
Indeed.
IshBestPony: you has the best fun facts
/me glomps IshBestPony
NOW WHO WILL HUG ME?
thanks CCCP and IshBestPony

IshBestPony: I like where this is going

Don't think so.
Meanwhile did
I've been here since the room was made.
I am eternal and have seen the rise and fall of empires.
Meanwhile: is wise
here comes the toot
As it has been, so shall it be.
Meanwhile: I am Ozymandias, king of kings
look on my works, ye mighty, and despair
Meanwhile is actually the moustache. It takes humans as hosts.
Yfw I was actually typing that.
What is the name of that dragon in episode 2??? Does he have a canon or fan name?
His name is "dragon"
from the youtube autocaption fail
he's a sea serpent
CCCP: pretty close to canon
he was a sea serpent though....
oh okay
it's like universal fanon and I think they might call him that in the studio too
still better lyrics than baby
sea serpent's are basically dragons
not hey arent

Meanwhile: red mage

I have no idea what you're talking about so I just used terminology I'm familiar with.
Makes him sound smart
It still fails though
Indeed.
Indeed indeed.
Most methods of sounding smart don't work for me.
Probably because I'm a bit thick.
...neat
i think
Nerf moustaches.
Moustaches are nerf repellant.
RX-78-SweetieBot: but then Meanwhile would cease to exist
Meanwhile's moustache is OP as fuck
