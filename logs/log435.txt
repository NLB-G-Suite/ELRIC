without some reverend to show up and ruin the fun of having people live longer
without religion, we'd still have 5384202 reasons to hate each other.
I'm fairly sure not discussing controversial topics is in the rules.
Or maybe I could take advantage of this and toast marshmellows.
WASGHFANSFA SHHOly Shit....
13well, we prefer not to have drama bust out
Why do people always get butt hurt over relgion?
Or at least, were.
500 feedback messages? 500? FIVE-FREAKING-HUNDRED
WAT
Without Christianity, we would be free to dehumanize each other.
i should stop
in other news
13just watch railings a few more times

Starcaft Craftcraft
fanfics and music I tend to bypass
I subscribe both to EqD and DHN RSS
comics are soso. I sort of watch them on their own sites on deviantart and How Equestria Was Made
i swear, they knew boys were gonna watch and went "quick lets grab all the good boy cartoon female vas make em ponies and watch it grow"
most of them are crossovers though
punctuation would of probably helped that
uh oh
okay
/me has never haerd of DHN
13also DHN posts our movie nights on time
I'm not too familiar with DHN. I guess I should check it out more.

07Drake, it's unfortunate that you've never had a Krispy Kreme doughnut before
04...
04Yes I have
I hafts go, BMN starts at 7:00 right?
04They are delicious
good
07Wait, do they have KK in Australia?
04They did, until they went out of business.
10How does KK go out of business
10Doughnuts are gooooood
1,3yes, yes it is :p
04I know, I loved KK doughnuts.
03it's because Homer Simpson moved
03duh
04But I think they just opened too many stores.
07That sucks D=
07KK is one of the many reasons why I want to visit the States again
07SHEENAh
03I keep misreading those as KKK and thinking you all are racist.

03the music was about 8dB too loud
yea because unlike the rest of us you can see the VU meters indicating pre-processing levels
03yeah
03He told me to have the VU meteres in the yellow

Come see me on http://www.lock-freesex.com
Come see me on http://www.lock-freesex.com
Come see me on http://www.lock-freesex.com
even then I can run additional processing
since they have a Winamp link
03XD
03I'm gonna be using Winamp to play the songs
the second of the two I really like
you might want to keep those in mind
they are Winamp plugins for audio processing
i'll just wait until it can be pirated, try it and then if i can run it i'll buy it

ITS NOT a trap?
I cannot produce apathy
No more owner!
no wait its a trap
and here it comes
Avengers… I thought after TDK I'd never see a fun yet good superhero movie again.
No, apathy is a lack of comcern for someone

This isnt that scary
the scariest villains are the old ones
02my last mouse lasted 4 years
Jersers Krerst!
How is this even scary?
And he doesn't flee
Antony Hopkins is a damn fine actor.
^
oh LOL YMCA
Village People are amazing
He killed two men just for the sake of killing them
Are there seriously only two guards in that building?!
nah he's walking out
02the mouse that's acting buggy is an iHome

Oh dear.
DUDE
lol
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ernkermperternt kerps klersher
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
/me plays Slayer music
USA! USA!
For example
Hannibal Lecter reminds me of Fluttershy
They're both adorable
hey
I think spiders are adorable.
I wouldn't say "adorable"
Spiders are awesome
Lecter is in now way adorable, but he's certainly fascinating.

Mer lerderl perner, mer lerderl perner
I like Lecter because he's sophisticated.
Erherer
K, these close up shots are a little weird.
shit this is in my state
02Chances of getting something that’s defective are high
Lecter is the type of mind I could fall for given a different physical appearance.
er
the mind of a mass murderer?
02or just plain cheap
ANd not being a psychopathic murderer.
Oh no I'm fine with that.
I just wish he were younger.
Oh I see
I swing like a pendulum.
although internal components can be a bit iffy too

YOU SHOULD HAVE SHOT HIM!
Pew pew pew.
Lector, you can see him thinking
I missed it

mangina?
at least he can be reasoned with, to an extent
The following scenes are just unbelievably tense
*les painful
and he's less likely to go off like a firecracker
the first time I watched this film was on a plane
To relieve the terror.

02well yeah
02not everyone can like the same things
6I actually get irritated when my name shows up on that script

WHERE'S HANNIBAL?!
6night
lol, Bieber Pelt.
Id rather deal with chrysallis then buffalo bill
02I would say NS but I don't want to hear any jokes :P
02she gave it to someone though
6I know I tend to get upset at irrational things
:O
6shipping and ownership scripts are two of them
0,14say wha
6mainly because I don't like my name being brought up
...and then the sequals SUCKED
07also cuz eons are the only things worth owning
/me runs
02but you like using the !Espeon script
I wouldn't say they sucked.
wow
way to ruin her day
07cuz he was first lol
They definitely weren't as good, but sequels rarely are.
HIM
not a sequal
6the espeon script has been around probably 3 times as long as you have
Was Manhunter the first Hannibal movie made?
he didn't hang up the phone right?
I get the feeling that Clarice actually sort of likes Hannibal.
6and he WILLINGLY has it here
pretty sure this was the first Hannibal Lector movie
in a weird way.
released, anyway
02I don't have a real ownership script :D
I thought Manhunter was 80s
And it ends
delicious dominicans
Well
shit, that was genuinely scary
9/10, would watch again
I'm pleased
Yep, Manhunter was 1986
10/10

Masterpiece.

Also, saw the Avengers last night
WAS AMAZING
It was great
My friends and I wore SuperHero masks
I probably won't see The Avengers.
Oh heroes that WERENT in the movie
Because I'm not really interested.
Brb guys
a bunch of friends went to see the avengers and were asking in line if that was the line to see twilight
lol
I was actually surprised that Spider Man wasn't in that film.
I was later informed of my noobyness.
i wanted to go, sadly was busy that day
was spiderman ever part of the avengers?
Briefly.
Dude, nearly every marvel hero has been part of the avengers at some point
they still collab occasionally
Yes
http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/035/a/b/the_helements_of_armory_by_locoviscacha-d4oon4j.jpg
