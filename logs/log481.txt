All Agent Smith needs now is the ability to turn invisible and beat the crap out of Neo to prevent the 2nd and 3rd movies.
:)
13felt very very slow paced
:) thanks for the greeting
:)
Hi people, how are you? I'm still doozy, just woke up!
Don't really give a damn about graphics
I only watched SAC
Nice cam work here.
Technically, I didn't spoil this movie
Second and Third movies have some of the best Rifftrax. I'm glad they exist.
Same here, Poly
ALIENZ
13mostly cause they have all three riffers :3
I cant whatch this move for the plot
Gameplay and story (when there is one) are way more important to me than graphics.
they get more bullets every time they change bodies, apparently
13there does sometimes feel like something is missing when one of them isn't on the riff
go Neil Go
Single button
at that range one shots enough
Missing a lot.:D
MISSED
he missed
:D
ded
Time for hax
i think he is ok
What's my high score?
MISSED ME! :D
13original
13they haven't done legacy
Yea, they haven't riffed Legacy (yet)
i rage cause of my battery
can this be the end
13i want to see them do twister
plot twist
I could have sworn they did Twister...
I want to see a riff on Chronicle
turns out, you're a necrophiliac
/me thinks of the Rifftrax that had Korra doing the riffs.
*Hugs geeky-brony*
/me goes to the Rifftrax site now
WHOAAA
OK. Because this dialog makes TOTAL sense, because.. umm... No, he's right. TOTAL logical fallacy.
/me inserts coin
magic
Continue?
Now kiss :)
Vendetta.
13nope
HAXXXXXX!!!

00,10so acording to the math. inorder to fall 30feet and not be hurt you would have to be wraped in 50 feet of bubblewrap

Hi. I'm Neo. And I'm also a severe skin disease.

It's just that the music evolves over the course of the solitude. And then afterwards, the music from that time becomes traditional folksongs.
It even becomes ancient traditional songs eventually.

meh, according to BBC weather, it's going to be cloudy and rainy
but you should all try to, if you can
Saturn apprently nasas going to stream it
