/me hugs CCCP :$
Meanwhile I expected it to be her pet, but gummy is a toothless aligator, i have no clue what a pink porcupine means
I dunno
GilDash: yeah he kinda deserved it, the horse was named Jack so he insisted on calling it Apple Jack
Actually you would smell smoke, not fire.
Im good, CCCP, how are you?
Wrek|Dusty: Where's Nittany_Discord when you need him so he can dust you off? ;P
mine loads fine
Pictures?
Hello CCCP

Gamer_Luna: well... you could get ear plugs ^^ there are three pits and 2 yippy dogs next door to me and the bark at the night... so...
Gamer_Luna: Then find a dead one. Crows will only react to dead members of their family, then will pass the word around. You'd never see another crow around your house ever again.

CCTHEBRONY afraid of being molested?
/me noms on Derpy
Derpy_Hooves: Wat tha Fak?
RPGs
Oh,thank you Litwick :)
Bronysith: Molestia is best pony
And probably around $5k-$10k startup costs
and how do you plan on competing with the already-huge mmos
Derpy_Hooves: derp? lol
Molestia? You guys are worreid about MOLESTIA?! We have three Discords! She doesn't stand a chance! :) http://derpy.me/26-XI
CupcakeWarrior: getting with an alicorn if i was a pony. that would be awesome. magic and wings. damn
Gamer_Luna: But I?...
Nvm.
Don't really have to compete, people get bored of games pretty easily and there's not a lot of brand loyalty
Ninjazz|Challenge: Go to bed
Petrified_Discord: O____O
Omm: I just woke up an hour ago. :|
is that startup cost including what it will cost to get the game to the public
The person on the stream looks creepy 0_0
Petrified_Discord: Welp. I enjoyed it
what did he just say
Ninjazz|Challenge: And you are already gumpy
or are there like, kind of frameworks you can buy and just customize
Petrified_Discord: i dont think you understand. i love molestia
I take that as no-one..
to save costs
Now, I don't know how much it will cost to get a game licensed, that's going to depend on what kind of deal I make with the russians
Ninjazz|Challenge: No,Litwick said me and Irish are OTP,so I thanked him for saying that :)
8,6seriously, I have work to do, stop making me come in here to break up the RP
Bronysith: I understand perfectly. To each their own, I suppose :/

/me snaps his fingers and bursts into flames.
/me hugs DeathStar
i had an idea for an easy way to extract peoples money
link your pc game with an iphone/ipod app
and make people pay via in app purchase
which would give them credit in your pc game
we hope to see more people here
that way people can buy itunes cards and use that as money in your game
so you dont have to deal with getting into stores and people without credit cards can pay
and kids with ipods with their parents cards attached,.
i can just spout off interesting monetization techniques all day...
21 century shoping
/me hugs MahBoi777

hire me when your making big $$$$.

CupcakeWarrior: ur makin me hungry, and I hate broccoli

I think it can be done, it's just a matter of organization
It's low risk for them to say yes
No thanks Twi_Fi. I'll take panda 's :$
Especially if I make a good impression
Ponies47: :O
nom nom nom :)
/me wants to play the violin
Ponies47: but... Twi_Fi did it out of kindness
Risk isn't always monetary
FlareChaser: yellow

Risk can be in brand identity too.
The risk for them is.. yeah
brand identity
cachi01: RED
BLUE
MahBoi777: broccoli is delish with melted cheese :D
It takes a long time to grow a broccoli tree and harvest broccoli.

herro Reikim
You'll burn your cash.
Stop fighting over me guys! I'm only one person <3
Meanwhile: But its scientifically impossible for a human to successfully breed with a pony
ohh I see now
CupcakeWarrior: Why are you telling me that?
I love going out and having my own office space and stuff
Do you stick to local jobs?
RAWRity: hehe I think its good ^^
CupcakeWarrior: D:
CupcakeWarrior: but not magically impossible.
Derpy_Hooves: Mario is best Mascot
Meanwhile: I thought you had babies
wow, I'm lost
Meanwhile: you wanna breed with ponies
...
This chat....
What.
but I resist the urge because it just eats away at anything you make. grow when you need to, not just because you want a flashy office.
:D
Ohai Everlasting_Joy
So I just got back from watching Casshern 9the live-action movie). It's now going in my B-list selection, PERMANENTLY, by dint of being the only movie I've ever seen where I have had no fucking clue what was going on.
Shreaded Wheat!?
Twi_Fi: eeyup... welcome to brony state
/me 's brain is fucked.
Howdy CupcakeWarrior!

Everlasting_Joy: you said "ill get back to you on that"
Everlasting_Joy: oh, I hope everything goes well:S
Sith has a point tbh, it's nearly 5AM.
and move stock through, make a little bit, but keep stuff cheap
Shizuka: Technically (if you believe most monotheistic religions) God is EVERYTHING. So that statement could apply to literally all statements.
G'night everypony.
its how we're rolling right now.
I love how mods will randomly say something and everyone notices because of color coating :D
gnight Bronysith
Meanwhile: night night

NOOOOO DIE
MahBoi777: no :( I hate being homesick
I appreciate it :)
cachi01: KILL IT KILL IT WITH FIRE
/me kills mozilla firefox

Internet Explorer: When Safe-mode is your only choice.
cachi01: >.> dont kill spitfire fox
NOOOOOO U SEE WUT U MAKE ME DO OPERA?
cachi01: OH NO MAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

we grossed about $140k last month
which is alright
I thought about doing something through Ebay but I just didnt want to deal with the tax work
/me closes opera and internet explorer
MahBoi777: oh XD
now the madness ended
But how much of that do you spend?
What are we talking about?
Madness
considering we are 5 months old.
FlootahShy: fruit
...that's a catchy slogan
cachi01: Phew. Now you just have to revive Firefox.
FlootahShy: :D we are talking about you :D
grief must be beefy
cachi01: Opera's pretty good actually.
Beef up the grief
I hear that Facebook is planning to buy Opera
about $40k of that is profit
panda: I know I'll be home in due time, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.
I only used Opera because it was the Wii browser
I used Opera for awile. Then Firefox took me over.
mmm i think its time for ctrl+shift+
n
Everlasting_Joy: i know :( I hate being away from home... it sucks
25 denarii. good deal
Everlasting_Joy: you have my sympathy
I love all you guys fighting over me, defending me! <3

...
RAWRity: We are all. Screwed.
and $0 spent on advertising.
/me ignores FlareChaser
I like Firefox, but I also use Chrome sometimes
is there anyone actually doing that?
Thats amazing, you got me tempted to recheck ebay
Twi_Fi: Lol
FlareChaser: anytime, you are a good friend ^^ so i will defend you till the end

when you attend a funeral / it is sad to think that sooner-or / later those you love will fling you into trees.
Gamer_Luna: Nice
flinging funeral? sounds cool
Reikim: Yeah :)
you basically have to make something
Gamer_Luna I made Ponies47 an OC, in 20 minutes
and sell it on ebay
anything commercial is going to be priced to nothing from the chinese ebayers
Ive had good luck in the past in buying stuff real cheap
Gamer_Luna: Well that's awfully nice! You, sir, embody the Equestrian spirit.
well, I must be leaving. Bon nuit
I wouldnt have to worry about chinese ebayers, they dont sell vintage collectables
Ponies47: I call everything a request :$
Im going to make some stuff with my printer and sell it for fun
Biglaw: I difn't ask. He/she wanted to :)

if it doesnt work out
It WILL sell
Derpy_Hooves: I can't argue with that.
try something else
keep going eventually something will stick.
Problem is the tax stuff :/ I didnt have any intention to turn it commercial
I have sold stuff in the past
That card is awesome Derpy_Hooves.
toasted socks
yeah I hate taxes
Cool
but it was all personal stuff
its retarded filing they make it so complicated

Anyway, Ninjazz|Challenge, I was busy over the weekend and had no computer to return to
!ping
!pong
the seaponies are really bad at tech support, I've found.
call upon the sea ponies, when you're in distress,
owlicious: Nah, forget them
/me will not join in the pinging of mods in such a manner
/me casts a spell on the video's issues
Ahhh, no wonder, Polydunami. good to see you back, though, :)
owlicious: well.... i did and im in the middle of land... and they didnt come
Great, now I'm imagining sea pony tech support.
helpful as can be ponies, they'll see you ... fech
Ninjazz|Challenge: ಠ_ಠ7

/me rings sea pony tech support
hen3ry, the problems with oursourcing
MahBoi777: nice! :D
Dang it, magic doesn't work :(
*outsourcing

StupidSexyCJ: lol_thanks
the power of greyskull compels you
SHOO BE DOO, SHOO SHOO BE DOO
Reikim: got the busy signal right?
MahBoi777: *Anime Thumbs Up*
Wrek|Dusty I do apologize for disturbing you, but there seems to be an issue with the stream.
... I think I will take a two minute break. I'll be back
im going to reboot so BRB everypony!
Um, hello? Is this tech support?
SHOO BE DOO
My Little Cuttlefish
all ponies in chat: If anypony has a message for ninjazz while he's doing the challenge, please divert them to me
(Jet Engine Souns)
The seaponies don't have any computer-- or any electronic tech skills at all. Because they live under WATER. Makes it really really difficult. They can't even use a toaster. With or without socks.
When you feel like you're sinking fast, when you're cast adrift
sounds*
/me likes jet engines
Ninjazz|Challenge Sylandest: No
(disgruntled sigh) This is Swift Current, this call may be monitored for blah blah blah... forget it.

Om: Oh. -_-'
MahBoi777: I HATE CHOCOLATE MILK

Reikim: O_O he does?
O-o
wait, theres a god now, Reikim ?
wizards? damnit underp!!!!
Da fuck....
True story: My uncle had a jar of bull testes near the front door. Always made a point to show it to anyone dating either of his daughters, and left off the bit where the balls came from bulls.
Spectrum_Rush: sorry, I just ate
/me actually loves chocolate milk. Specifically Tromoo
*trumoo
panda: Or gives them even worse fates. Depending on the god in question, of course.
Pinkies4thWall: O U
Whos been using my OC's pony name on here >_>
Pinkies4thWall: oh my.... trumoo?
Wow. I just checked to see if Eddie Izzard is going on, and caught it on the best possible frame for this. It's like INB4 Keyframe.
Reikim: true :D
not me
Not I said the truthful liar
hen3ry: See, when my sister wanted to date, my father made a point of showing off his knife skills. Cut a piece of steak so thin you can see through it...
hen3ry: that's a good idea.
I wonder what movies are being streamed next week... ?
http://imgur.com/gallery/KZvcB
is that a threat on his part, Reikim ?
EVERYPONY! Favorite discorded Mane 6. GO!
Hay, is anyone's stream is derping?
Discord can't get me. I can't be turned evil! :)
cowvarkian: nah, he just liked making steak.
Pinkies4thWall: greedity :D
I'm going to bed. Hope the video stops derping.
TheRainbowDash: i believe all of ours are
Derpy_Hooves: KITTEH
ah, ok Reikim
TheRainbowDash, is that you?
It's not legally a threat if you're not actually saying you're going to do it to somepony. It's just a gulp-inducing implication.
TheRainbowDash: Nope
TheRainbowDash: eeeyup
Polydunami: Yes, this is me.
Mine is Liarjack
It's been a while; I haven't been on lately
Still though it sounds like your doing very well :)
wait, TheRainbowDash you're eddie izzard?
Liarjack for chocolate milk
Pinkies4thWall: oh, well i call her apple Lie :D
Polydunami: Oh, I have noticed...well, good to see you again.:)

CeilingKirz: dat color!

8,6because I speak in a few different channels, and I don't use color in all of them
Gamer_Luna: CheeriMac
Pretty good cchoices today on the lottery, I'm looking forward to seeing them for the next Bronystate Movie Night.
kirz, tis a lie
thx hen3ry it worked =D!
Anyway, TheRainbowDash, the problem isn't with the stream itself but the video being played
Rather, the video encoding is corrupt, I guess
cachi01: no prob. software derps usually fixed that way 99% of the time
Polydunami: Oh, really? Didn't know that the video was messing up, and not the streamer itself.
I have never heard of either of the movies :P
^
Type in the best couple on this CHAT,not the stream. :)
Ponies47: leon the professional is the SHIT!
best couple in this chat? Not Applicable.
Polydunami: half of them at least
meh always could do better
Gamer_Luna: Shizuka x Vivi is best couple
http://imgur.com/gallery/AKinv when you see it
Gamer_Luna: otakon x somepony
panda: I have never heard of it :$
Gamer_Luna: well... i was gonna say otakon and everyting but I dont wanna get kicked
otakon x cachi01
best couple? what?
Ponies47: its from 1992 ^^
hmm... that's true...
08,01best couple.
cachi01: You can get banned for shipping otakon

Oh, if only that were true
08,01Ponies47: that woudl never work
08,01panda: yes
Polydunami: wait I thought you broke up with sanity :D
Ponies47: i was born in 90 but i didnt find the movie till about 2002
This is a trope in Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 episode "Praying to Celestia that it is merely coincidence, but another background pony strongly resembles a certain pony from a certain MLP game that is not suitable for younger audiences. "
But I cannot get the reference
Polydunami never went anywhere with sanity :3
/me dances
panda: :D
Worse pairing in this chat? :)
CrimsonPhoenix: WUUUUT? O_o
You know what? I was up until about that time last night doing torrent and playlist stuff.
Polydunami is a sanity virgin xD
I don't get it ether CrimsonPhoenix
http://imgur.com/gallery/AKinv look closly at the croud of mermaids in the background
who needs sanity?
what am i watching?
08,01panda: :(
What is with the video? It keeps derping.
well it IS a Background pony
worst pairing in this chat? Everypony x sanity
Derpy_Hooves: Goofy can breathe underwater...wat
so it`s nearly unnoticeable
Derpy_Hooves: saw it
Derpy_Hooves: What are we looking at?
CrimsonPhoenix: i didnt understand wut u said back there lol
but still that pick my curiosity
CrimsonPhoenix: and which game?
Ponies47, it's not the stream, it's the video itself
hen3ry: it's just not ment to be
It doesn't say
08,01Reikim: i've been up for about 24 hours straight now
Monfang: goofy donald duck, and mickey are standing there side by side

Saw the derpy video on youtube and had to find the site
13cachi01: technically, two
13rei is partitioned into three though
yay
Pinkies4thWall: hehe
Big_Macintosh_1992, are you new here? Welcome to bronystate then!
Funny how they started out riffing bad movies. Now that they're clear of copyright entanglements, they're free to riff GOOD movies.
Shizuka: ...You named your drives?
13ofc
yeah, just found it
Pinkies4thWall: there's no shame in objecting
This is one of those movies, that I still haven't gotten to this day.
Sweet, I found this website the same way :3
welcom to Sumerpan
Well, still haven't got the plot of this...
I've never a stretched copy of this on the internets
13i don't think i'll be able to fix the stretching without breaking my setup, sorry
Big_Macintosh_1992: Welcome to the bronystate herd! :)
8,6off to bed, have a good night everypony :)
i've nver seen the matrix :P

Night kirz

13and the riff is a little unbalanced
cya ceilingkirz
Ponies47: Wait, somepony is absolutely new here?

oh yay a newfoal

Ah well
Sweet. thanks
No problem
Big_Macintosh_1992: Welcome to Bronystate
13it's more stable to capture the window directly, but i have it set up so it doesn't change window size during a playlist
thanks
This is going to be FULL of computer maintenance jokes, isn't it?
Hush now quiet now quiet now ceilingKirz it's time to lay your sleepy head :)
run they r trying to fix ur computer!
Big_Macintosh_1992: So, you're completely new here on Bronystate? Like your first day?
13problem is that's done at the expense of being able to stretch a video from its stored format
Kandarihu: most likely
yes, first day
Well, as much as I'd absolutely love to be up until 2 in the morning, but I actually have to be up tomorrow. Or, later today.
actually looks somewhat ok popped out and then full-screen'd
Darn, I should have asked for the Rifftrax of Inception

the riftrax of the room is not good
Sylandest: Tell me when we get a new comer.
Ninjazz|Challenge: aye aye, captain

13but yeah, this'll end pretty late for me, would be way way way too late if i stayed up to run reloaded
Oh god, The Day After Tomorrow xD

Wait, who is doing this, commentary of this movie?
Rifftrax is?
13TheRainbowDash: Michael J Nelson and Kevin Murphy, rifftrax
13bill isn't on this one
MahBoi777: its better than having a alien stuck to your face, then come out of your stomach =/
Shizku, oh alright.
Ponies47: What 9000!?!
Shizuka: do mst3k do bad films, while Rifftrax do good films?
Darkts3: actually they burst thru your chest and ribcage

Goodnight Biglaw ;)
Good night Everypony!
Bow chicka wow wow
ribs? chichiron/
RainbowcrashNBurn: MST3K had a status quo where they could ONLY do bad movies. Rifftrax has no internal continuity or status quo or characterization. It's just 3 people poking fun at the movie. So they riff what they like.

13just think how short the movie would be if he went blue
yeah, the trots for sure
Shizuka: CREDITS

I sense a great disturbance in the Matrix. It's as if a million programs suddenly had horrible memory leaks, and then closed out.
Shizuka: Blue pill=no need for any sequels.
takes blue pilll, cue credits
And then Neo took both
Shizuka, I wonder what Eiffel 65 thinks about that statement?
That's how the hippies started
Shizuka: ahh yes but the blue's a supository:S

Taking both pills means he loses all of his memories of Morpheus' influence, but he still gets disconnected and ejected from the Matrix. Taking both pills means the movie becomes a comedy.

TheRainbowDash: new aspect of physics...fall from a high enough height, and the ground will absorb you entirely
DeathStar: O U

Mind makes it real=just another universe, just some Portal stuff or whatever.
it self hurt
I have jelly and ice cream with my meal in hospital soooo.... That's what I mean
Polydunami:Only towards trolls
Righto
Sylandest: And then you bleed in real life, but somepony tells you it's just your imagination.
he fell from 100 stories high, and he bellyflopped the pavement. Yes, it hurt.
So, if you had sex in the Matrix, would you get pregnant in the real world?
TheRainbowDash: or is it? It's all in the mind...or is it not in the mind?
13bah, rub some dirt on it
Mutterguy: Wait, you are in the hospital?
woo this song
Polydunnai. Uhuh. Thera
6_9 oh no ive gone cross eyed
please I can belly flop from like...200 stories...lifting weights...and only die like twice in the process
Sylandest: That is the ultimate question of this movie, and still, I don't get it.:D
have a cup of cement and harden the **** up
Polydunami: for that matter would sex in the matrix carry over into real life...
13HeavyMetalDash: WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS
TheRainbowDash: the answer is this: maybe :D
It's like that "sex scene" in Demolition Man

Gee. I was getting ticked off by the riffing. Then the violence started, and the riffing got funny again.
before ther was m9 i think
dat Spybreak
I played the demo of the PS2 Matrix game, and this scene was where the demo started. Had NO idea how to continue. I tried killing everybody, but I ran out of time. I then tried running right to the elevator, but nothing happened and I died.

Hello xmasskills

Pikmin 1 was kinda neat. Pikmin 2 was zomg amazing.
Borat was one of the worst movies in existance. It made me want to nuke a middle-eastern country
hey poptart-pony
00,10elevatores dont work like this
Borat tried too hard to be funny
ding BOOM
FIAH
Sumica, welcome to the Matrix
Borat was awesome. or so I remember
there is no elevator
Sumica: They don't go BOOM in slow-mo?
Derp
I think Gen 5 of Pokemon might be the only gen that I don't beat the storyline off.
I haven't seen Borat in like 6 years
lol random guy with a knife
xD
I thought Borat was freakin hillarious
/me bursts into flames and explodes
under attack? u don say
Borat is just one of those movies that I don't want to see.
beat the story line off?
OH MY CONTACT
MahBoi777: I do say. in slow mo at that
Borat lost its humour about a quarter in
:D what
?
:D
dat bullet time
hell ya
copying that scene from Fairly Odd Parents
classic bullet dodging
lolololo
Dodge this!
You're lucky. It has a scene where 2 guys fight eachother in a hotel room while they're both naked. Ugh, I almost puked as I typed that.
Derp
BOOM HEADSHOT
MahBoi777: lol
I feel......strange
dat head shot
I wouldn't be surprised if we end up seeing it on the stream.
Gamer_Luna: why is that?
banana republic

00,10the same effect can also be acheaved with a shotgun at mid range
OH GOD!

Whenever I go to the drive-thru or a restauraunt I always order a Diet, since it's easiest to order
Never mind
Polydunami: not quite what you were hoping for :P
dat deale
Oh No!
MahBoi777: yus
I notice that when the movie is quiet, I can't hear the dialog over the riffing. When the movie is loud, I can't hear the riffing over the movie. And this is an avi, so fixing the audio at this point is impossible.
shes goin down
Meh, just making a slight joke
hehehe
Eddmario: I dislike Diet... too sweet for me XP
13like i said at the start Kandarihu
/me whines about CoD sequels yet is dying to play Pokemon B/W 2 and the back to back NSMB games.
13quality on my rifftrax collection varies
I wanna fall out a window now 6_9
13volume leveling is helping
Gamer_Luna, I just wanna dance
/me dances
Okay. I didn't catch that at the beginning.
13but i would appreciate if you didn't complain about every single thing we stream...
If that was me on BF3 I would have missed it by an inch... IT ALWAYS HAPPENS~
13because you do..
00,10you must have a weak audio program then Kandarihu
The only problem have with the Matrix full series 2 disc dvd set is the animatrix actually repeats one of the storylines
Gamer_Luna: no don do that
Terribly sorry.
Man...I just HAD to miss basicaly the entirety of the movie/riff...granted, I think I have this riff...lol
dafaq just happend?
why does the helicopter always have to crash??
Dat ass...
I had problems with the audio too. I'm listening to my own copy of this Rifftrax
13DuskStarshimmer: trinity did a GTA
13crashed her vehicle
*watching*
That helicopter did a Super Mario 64
Eddmario: Which was part of the point of The Animatrix.
Hia Shizuberry
I'm sorry about that. I feel like I'm about to become a lot more sorrier.
MahBoi777: its a required law of fiction. Have a good vehicle? We have to trash it
13Sylandest: heh yeah, just look at the bourne series
13they make cars cry
WAsnt morphius shot? He seems pretty good currently
bs bs bs bs
I call BS
BEE ESS
I call BS
dem CRT monitors
13ess bee
Shizuberry: eeyup. Lots of fiction rules you pick up on in writing, lol
Then, of course, there's the Michael Bay law..."Have something? Blow it up!"
No, I mean that since the DVD version of i has each story as a different scene, one of them will play itself back-to-back unless you do some messing around with the remote
back
00,10oh god, are we gonna have to hear gir sing "wakeup"?
13nah
I just wanna........
I believe it's the Part 1 of the 2-Part story of how the machines came to power
13i think I See You and Heart Will Go On are the only two i have where dis sings
Can we pleas hear gir sing "wakeup"
Gamer_Luna: why so awesome
13only cause they're super sappy credits music
Now I wanna hear the robot sing My Heart Will Go On again XD
The way N left after B/W left me cold. I'm glad there's a sequel.
DANCE
That old guy is creeped the BUCK OUT!
shut up and answer the phone
I know, I NEEDED closure
B/W 2 is like a middle finger to all the people waiting for Pokemon Grey.
Carrie Anne-Moss reminds me of Cillian Murphy
ouuu cute
13Polydunami: can't...unsee....
BRB
13forever..
wtf
Flippy in the beam-- THIS I do not understand.
I wanna hear Yugi, Jaden, and Yusae (sp?) from Yu-Gi-Oh sing a parody of "Beelzeboss" from Tenacious D together
You're welcome x3
Mister Anderson
Hi eon :3
Cute, where?
hihi
Run forest Run
Your face.
13dat eeeyup
Keanu Reeves and Adrian Brody look so similar
lol
Tov, I'd argue that that it's more of the opposite. They're actually making a legitimate sequel instead of a "director's cut"
lol
eeeeeerup
BIG MAC!
RainbowcrashNBurn: I guess it is, since the Grey pokemon is on the box
13PONIES

And oddly enough, a properly partly chewed fruit roll up can look exactly like blood. Um. Please do not ask me how I know that.
:3c
So, will B/W 2 be G6 or the extension to G5?
13with a hint of lemon
MahBoi777: Gamer_Luna now im blushing
Matrix 3 spoiler: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET: Neo and Trinity both die
TIP! ME! OVER! AND POUR! ME! OUT!
Oh, I suppose it's too soon for G6
Kandarihu, extension to G5 I believe
00,10you are waiting on a train neo.
choo choo
I wouldn't mind seeing something like that as a videogame boss in pokemon.
B/W 2 are still part of G5.
why would it be G6
13dat sumica <3
RainbowcrashNBurn: i knew they were all one originally!! i need to bitchslap my freinds, they argued with me saying i was full of it
You're waiting for a train
A train that will take you far away
sound like the screeching of brakes
Sumica they are supposed to that was asmall plothole
inb4 I like trains
Okay. Sorry for asking a stupid question.
I liek trains
Neo Sporin
You know where you hope this train will take you...
G6 would be a true 3DS game with new pokemon.
That agent really is an idiot, isn't he.
G6 will most likely be for the 3DS and will feature another new region and new pokemon.
But you---
13oh....
epic jump is epic
hi im new here
OH MY GOD. Bronystate's streams are all week now? Goodbye social life.
/me 13just realized you guys are talking about pokemon...
iheartribs, Allo!
whatthese guys SHOULD have made is a Ranma 1/2 movie.
:D dat Shizuberry
He can't shot Neo along with Neo shooting him, but it's perfectly okay for them both to get hit by train.
welcome iheartribs
Ninjazz|Challenge: newbie you know what to do
00,10yeah took me a bit too Shizuberry
Because Larry Wachowski is now a girl?
13i was wondering why you were waiting for black and white 2 when... that came out in like 2004
bah to Ranma 1/2..
I only display my data is vertial strings of binary
Spectrum_Rush|Draws: Point at him for me!

I STILL need to watch Ghost in the shell...
00,10my cabbages!
/me hugs Gamer_Luna
lol door
hopefully G6 wont have 10 year old graphics.
13honestly i didn't like the original movie having watched SAC
All Agent Smith needs now is the ability to turn invisible and beat the crap out of Neo to prevent the 2nd and 3rd movies.
:)
13felt very very slow paced
:) thanks for the greeting
:)
Hi people, how are you? I'm still doozy, just woke up!
Don't really give a damn about graphics
I only watched SAC
DerpSurge: howdy!
Nice cam work here.
hey DerpSurge!
hello iheartribs welcom
Heroic jump is heroic
Which ghost in the shell was streamed here?
Shizuberry: It was something of the art film, true.
Technically, I didn't spoil this movie
When I see good graphics, I get skeptical about the quality of the gameplay :|
Second and Third movies have some of the best Rifftrax. I'm glad they exist.
Shizuberry: Just with guns.
Same here, Poly
ALIENZ
Hey there DerpSurge :3
Why not zoidberg?
13oh yes, reloaded and revolutions are much better :3
13mostly cause they have all three riffers :3
someone ping me when neo gets to the phone
I cant whatch this move for the plot
Both of them have Mike, Kevin and Bill in them
that moment when you freak out cause your laptop is dying and you cant find the cable -_-
Gameplay and story (when there is one) are way more important to me than graphics.
Indeed
Hey, are these the MST3K doing rifftraxes? :D YAY
they get more bullets every time they change bodies, apparently
13there does sometimes feel like something is missing when one of them isn't on the riff
13bill on this one, mike on day after tomorrow, kevin on xmen
What?
go Neil Go
oni_link: I have yet to have a moment like that. But if that happens to me, sleep mode is preferable to losing everything I had open.
Single button
I like the riffs where they bring in special guests, like Weird Al for Jurassic Park, or Jonathan Coulton and Paul & Storm for Tron.
at that range one shots enough
It a little off with Crow T Robots naturally high-pitched voice.
Missing a lot.:D
MISSED
that washis last life GAME OVER
lolz
he missed
:D
ded
13my tron riff has serious desync issues.. probably need to try and reacquire it
Time for hax
Insert coin for new game.
i think he is ok
Need the Mario ded song to play
What's my high score?
MISSED ME! :D
Shizuberry: original or legacy?
13original
/me tries to decide if Twilight New Moon or Transformers 3 is his favorite Rifftrax.
Kandarihu: well i have a used 08 macbook with horrible battery life :[
13they haven't done legacy
Ponies47: yes
Tron riff would make me love you even more shizu
Yea, they haven't riffed Legacy (yet)
i rage cause of my battery

I could have sworn they did Twister...
I want to see a riff on Chronicle
Shizuberry: someon said they did yesterday

Hello SirGanjalf!
Phase4 I do need a new computer. BUT I STILL BELIVE LINU IS A CHEAP RIPOFF OF MAC!
:<
uh...
Oh boi...
dat swing
other way around. Mac is based on un*x these days, not t'other way around
You did not just insult Linux infront of Phase4.
woo fallout music
sudden stream made me jump out of my skin
Darkts3 You mean 50s music?
Well, MacOS and Linux are both based on Unix.
Ya
I just wanna shake dat flank http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqe1spjmna1qafrh6.gif
Butcher Pete! :$
how gwad DuskStarshimmer
who is streaming?
Anything Goes!
Kandarihu so tehy are similar? Hmm. Are tehy better? Because Im pretty settled with the mac layout.
/me dances
And it's by the composer!
shake shake shake, shake shake shake...
fallout music
WOO
whelp I'm thinking that I have lots of picture to draw music to compose and games to play and only a timeframe of 30 hours to do so
Fuck yeah pyro!
Anyone knows when is Valve's E3 conference starting?
dat mic spam
>fallout music
Cole Porter is awesome.
/me curls and rolls around like a goran.
awesome
Im dissapoint, geeky-brony
I am sick of people saying 50s music is fallout music.
I don't really feel like going into the differences.
so I bid the farewell be back soon bai
Rain: waht
Rain: I know, right.
TheRandomkid321: its because its in Fallout
phase is streaming ?
Rain: im sarry what i do
geeky-brony, you called this fallout music
This isn't Fallout music, it's Cole Porter.
i know
Ok I'm sane now. I've brushed my amne and I feel much better that now all that evil fruit is gone :)
Rain: it plays on galxy new radio in fall out 3
Darkts3 Then I must have my Pip Biy set to the wrong station... What game is it in?
*Mane
geeky-brony: correct sir
MahBoi777: yay
TheRandomkid321: F3.
geeky-brony, doesnt mean it is music that came from fallout
Rain: i know
Kammerjunk still played fo3 and never heared it
Playing as Pyro equipped in this(http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=73814273) set, while micspamming Fallout soundtrack - priceless.
those songs are much older than fallout
we all know that
take dat! und dis! und dat!
potis
TheRandomkid321: It comes on GNR every once in a while.
POW! haha
<3 http://arch.413chan.net/DDR-(n1318297864870).gif
But one word of advice. Have a freakin straight jacket just in case. ;)
And not a single fuck was given that 'good' day.
DuskStarshimmer: :D
If I ever lose it agian :)
Heavy X Sascha
XD
SirGanjalf: I approve this loadout.
lol
POW, hahaa
You know what? I just noticed that the Fallout games take place 200 years after a nuclear holocaust in the 1950s, and the interfaces and music still hearken to the pop culture at the time the nukes happened. So nobody living in the vaults made new music?
need a dispenser here!
:D silly server
Kandarihu, aparently not
MrSnugglewoods: nope
Kandarihu I guess not.
so long mom, I'm off to drop the bomb, so don't wait up for me....

cp_notsocoldfront
SO what si the point of this server?
fluter shy
Chat Derped?
lol
TheRandomkid321: people randomly get pony models with different stats
DeepSure... Okay then
So Missus R, with all her trimmings, can broadcast a bed from Simmons, 'cause Franklin knows anything goes.
It's just that the music evolves over the course of the solitude. And then afterwards, the music from that time becomes traditional folksongs.
It even becomes ancient traditional songs eventually.
im a go night evry pony
This looks like one awesome server.

Well, he was 77. I guess it was only a matter of time.
	 ಠ_ಠ
I heard it was a stroke.
Aw damn >.<
:(
Blarghh.
Why do ponies and TF2 mix so well?
nopony knows
If it were not for TF2 I may not have checked out MLP.
It's like a natural synergy.
Because of that one youtube vid....
Let me see if I can find it.
witch vid?
Equestria! BUCK YEAH!
lol
Can I post the link during a stream?
That Rarity is a Spy!
/me looks at stream.
For some reason I got into watching a bunch of TF2 vids on youtube.
Which led me to one with ponies.
And I was confused.
^
That vid led me to watch pony related vids.
The youtube poop pony vids.
Hai everypony!
Hello |Discord|
Welcome back
I think it was simple idle curiousity that got me into MLP.
hi
i think
I came across a vid of Pinkie Pie being crazy with straight hair.
trollhunter: You catch any trolls latly?
And I was like, "Why is the usually happy pony acting like this?"
I couldn't help hearing people debating what the attraction was that was getting so many grown people into a kids TV show.
Which caused me to watch the episodes.
So I went to the MLP wiki and started looking at all the info there
And the rest is history!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and then I started watching the PMV's
time to go everypon! Ill bbl today! :)
...and reading the fanfics...
naaa busness is a bit slow
...and then watching the show itself. :P
Then eventually i wound up here. :D
i'm getting a bit bored of tf2
Play Saints Row the Third.
when will the feed change
well anyone want to send me something cool............im bored
ANYTHING at all
keep it clean tho lol
alright, I'm gonna go to sleep now see ya guys later
My chat derped....
See ya OneTrickPony
bye OneTrickPony
bye
OneTrickPony: BYE
Maybe we should listen to the Trololo song. In honor of the Trololo guy. :(
hey Twi_Fi hows your day been
alexxm: It's been okay. I have been here all day.
lol
/me hugs Twi_Fi
/me hugs alexxm
However, I am now on a mission.
hugs to all
To find my cutie mark.
any ideas Twi_Fi
alexxm: Some
like what
Problem is I am interested in many things.
But I have no talents.....
:(
try them all then Twi_Fi your bound to find something your good at
Did I just hear Egoraptor?
yep
I thought so. :P
good remix
Twi_Fi have you tried beard growing
alexxm: :S
what Twi_Fi
alexxm: HAHAHAHA!
smooth dude
sorry Twi_Fi
:S :S :S
/me hugs Twi_Fi i'm sorry
Dis is srs biznus u no.
Suddenly death.
alexxm: i heard a book of chocolate can fix allmost anything tri that lol
box
Wait wait... You might be onto something with that chocolate book idea there. :O
/me gives Twi_Fi a box of chocolate i'm sorry
hullo again
A chocolate book would be bothe entertaining AND delicious! :)
does anyone not know what a planetary solar transit is?
Pale_Horse: u and me CHOCOLATE BOOK ENTERPRISE ???
YES! I am so in! :D
lol :D
like, if i say "the transit of venus", do you all know what i mean?
okay, i'll explain
it's really simple; just astro terminology
Twi_Fi: kinda
it's when a planet passes between us and the sun
Think about it. You read a gripping installment of The Wheel OF Time, or Game of Thrones... and when you're done.. YOU EAT IT! ;)
so you can see it sillouetted against the sun
alexxm: You are forgiven.
like the shadow of earth on teh moon like right now i think ?
obviously, this only happens with the inner planets
mercury and venus
alexxm: yeah, except with a planet
and therefore the visual is TINY
you see this little dark speck go across the sun
hey guys
alexxm: good question, and that's what i actually came on to talk about
The books could come in all sorts of varieties too. Orange chocolate books. Toffee chocolate books. Mint Chocolate books. The possibilities are almost endless! :O
because it doesn't happen very often
11.•10«11WB10 (Espeon10) 11WB10»11•. 10- WE FULLFILL EACHOTHER
hey dishwasher_EXTREME hows your day been
02*WB03(Espeon03)02WB* - * Espeon humps Umbreon <Espeon> *bumps <Espeon> Ahjdahsdsad <Espeon> WTF
good
the next transit of venus is in 2 days
Wot
and it doesn't happen again for over 100 years
2117, to be precise
?
so this will be pretty much your only chance to ever see it
dishwasher_EXTREME: transit of venus
And now i'm caramelldansen...6_9
I hate that map
It's designed for CP, not CTF
so if you want to see it, get yourself some appropriate eyewear
or a telescope WITH A SOLAR FILTER
never look at the sun through a telescope, unless you have a solar filter
naw, use telescopes to look at suns like a baws... a blind baws
or you will go blind
ooooh im in AUS so its night here the moon is just slowly disapearing lol
your eyes will melt
Hello dishwasher_EXTREME
Pfft. REAL men don't need working eyesight... :|
the milky way galaxy is goin to crash into another galaxy in 4 billion year.....trouble is we all be ded so we cant see them:(
and yes, i give this warning because i know someone who was stupid enough to do that
dishwasher_EXTREME: that's right; the Andromeda galaxy
i wish i could be alive to see that
it'd be a beautiful sight
over the course of thousands of years, you'd see the andromeda galaxy get bigger in the sky
Cant. Stop. Caramelldansen... :(
:(
Caramelldansen???
alexxm: our solar system would be ripped apart, for sure
Don't tell me the caramelldansen is only in my head! :O
the earth may well find itself flung into either of the galaxy's super massive black holes
Pale_Horse, its not
Caramelldansen!?
possibly Pale_Horse
Phase4: yay
Thank Luna.
Pale_Horse: ?? i have got no idea what going on lol Caramelldansen?? what is that
benny hill theme is best killing music
Yay Yakity Sax!
anyhoos, if you would like to observe this last-in-a-lifetime event: http://www.transitofvenus.org/june2012/eye-safety/281-six-ways-to-see-the-transit-of-venus
.hk
AHHH CrazyCherry you finally show up
mfw the observatory here has already ran out of eclipse protection
dishwasher_EXTREME: I've been here all the time....
i've ordered a solar filter sepcifically for viewing this
i just hope it arrives today or tomorrow
you werent here when im here/
solar filter for my telescope, i shoudl say
if my brother was here, i'd use his camera to take some pics for you all
Transit rolls around = Overcast all day. :(
whats a transit anyway
dishwasher_EXTREME eclipses with planets
ohhhhh
diashwasher_EXTREME: I have a personal life just FYI.
of course
the transit is from 11:04pm Tuesday to 5:55am Wednesday, lasting 7 hours
I'm pretty sure winter has been wrapped up already. :P
(both those times are UTC +1)
can he see it in asia ?
so 10:04pm GMT, and 4:55am GMT
Pale_Horse not in australia
You win THIS round, Logic... But there shall be another battle... :|
if you're lucky, you might be able to see it in asia
what Pale_Horse
I'm cleaning my room, ping me if you have something to say.
dishwasher_EXTREME: well, you have the times and longitude for me, so you should be able to work it out :P
but seriously, google it and you should find some stuff about how/if you can view it
this song is gunna be stuck in my head
imho this map favors blue
this is a very long round
that will probably end now
sunrise here is 4:30am on Wednesday
so i only have a 25 minute window to view it
and only if the skies are clear
so i guess i won't get a chance to see it myself :(
but you should all try to, if you can
as i say, it's not going to happen again for over 100 years
alexxm: aye, i'm gonna catch it there
i'm still going to be out with my telescope at 4:30am, though, just in case :P
that
was the first win i've had as defence on that map
awesome Phase4!
A Winner Is You
just going out for a walk back soon
usualy its instant blue wins
and you fight it out in part 2
part 3 actualy has a 30 minute timeout
wish i had solar filter for my telescope

ninja_pony, 4 with two hardware threads pre core
especially not after all the "you're not that good" talks our conductor gives us xD
but my conductor is god damned awesome
DAMNNNN
04hurr

Lil_B, :)
hyperthreading is awesome
i got it in the humble bundle
Lil_B: ich ben nein krugen?!
I
hmmmm hyperthreads? someone want to explain?
it's basically just a second set of registers in the processor
for desktop usage its epic
Phase4 me too XD I wanted the games and soundtracks :D
ooooh damn
ninja_pony: hyperthreading + pipelining + superscalar architectures = win
Lil_B: ich das nein kampf?
Lil_B: ich das nein kampf en Terraria??
Gunthler SPEAK ENGLISH!
sry about sound
Lil_B: Terraria?
i broke everything
Gunthler whats about Terraria?
damnit
hmmmm
Lil_B: Have you gotten full Hallowed in it?
Phase4: we need to go deeper
Simon: ...... just for the record THATS WHAT SHE SAID!! oooooh snap
Gunthler no, I wasn't on the server during the weekend, but I'm close i think
ninja_pony: tbh, I can't find why this joke can be insulting
it wasnt
OH COME ON
i hate windows sometimes
s/sometimes/all the time
what is happening on screen right now
trollhunter: streamception
my pathetic attempts to make this work
that so pointless
tsk tsk
Worst case: phase gets a webcam and streams a video of his monitor
Lil_B: Why is your Steam client in German if you don't speak it?
Phase4 should get on webcam and do a tap dance for us.
^^
trust me, you dont want to see me tap dance
u would like that wouldnt u Twi_Fi
:D
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Why not?
Phase4: ooooh i beg to differ
Gunthler I can speak it, I am from germany, but your translator wasn't good, I could in no way make out what you were trying to say :/
ok... is that working
lol Twi_Fi
lol, streaming to wrong embed
now i have to check if i can decypher gunthlers posts
Lil_B: lol I was just throwing together the few random german words that i knew, anyway. :D
and my chat broke
COME ON
Y U NO CAPTURE
Still black
Gotta catch them all!
PSYCHONAUTS <3
Video capture likes trolling
Gunthler It sounded like you were trying to ask me about "Mein Kampf"... something i wouldn't apprechiate :/
Hi everypony!! :)

Alchemist, ikr

hey gamer_luna
hello there Twi_Fi
Hello Lil_B :)
Why can't youtube buffer their entire videos anymore?
Monfang: Yeah, I have noticed that.
Not sure if that is to control the load on the site.
Like to make sure that only the video you are watching is the one loading.
And that you are not loading a bunch of videos in several tabs.
or something
Is there a stream?
Spell-of-Gaming: NO!
Spell-of-Gaming: I'm sorry.....
