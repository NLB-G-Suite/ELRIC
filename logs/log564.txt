Well, I guess my enthusiasm for L4D dropped enough that I'm dropping this.
13my brain has been too scrambled lately to support strategizing
13^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
...I give up on writing. Shizu's music just makes it impossible.
Dang, those Pirates actually have a winning season for once.
In a good way.
If someone would be willing to give me a complimentary copy, I'd be easily able to afford the DLC.
And the OST
You buy the music now? :O
13thought the OST comes with
The Bastion OST is sooo goood

Not anymore.
13but you still have to join us for uru
00,02that i do
00,02Shizuka, when you going on uru next?
This track is just causing me to trance out.
00,02Shamroc, actually i'm gona see if i cant nick someone elses free copy and just buy the soundtrack and dlc
00,02i'm much lower on money than i thought i was
13i forget if i got the two pack..
Wait...free copies?
... That link is kind of large :$
00,02Shamroc, no, i'm seriously low on money, checked my balance today
Huh. That's a good marketing strategy.

There's a fly on my screen
13insane: Don't bring up things like that again.
Ok xD

Muffin/10 for Twilights :3
For me, it's the same key, actually xD
twilight is Over9000/10
right there
It's kinda orientic....nto sure it fits Rarity
It's good, but for a theme song..
/me loves Uncharted 3's theme
Too Neoish?
It fits, because it's stylish
Orientic? Oriental?
Idk

/me stares in awe

00,10Still not sure how they did this bit
This is actually '30s.
too much clones
"Puttin' on the Ritz" is a popular song written and published in 1929 by Irving Berlin and introduced by Harry Richman in the musical film Puttin' on the Ritz (1930). The title derives from the slang expression "putting on the Ritz", meaning to dress very fashionably. The expression was inspired by the swanky Ritz Hotel.Can also be an adjective: "ritzy", meaning elegant, dapper; dressing well or putting on airs.
there was no color in the 30s
They see me trollin they hatin potrolling and then they catach me ridin dirty
has weird urge to wtch Mary Poppins
color was invented in 1943
lol
