yes yes it is
Also anyone noticed the "Locked" door that opened anyway?
And this is why you play test, folks
Yeah, pretty sure you should be able to sequencebreak after 'dat glitch
I take it back. Lex Luthor is NOT a genius.... A real genius would have been able to kill Supes over 1000 different ways if he really had him in his power like this. Lex is a bucking idiot. :|
Ha no that would be a useful glitch. No way that would happen
wtf did lex do now?
Like Ultimate 5 the worst enemy is the FLOOOR
what just happened
i can imagine his face getting red by the second
This game is just so wrong
agreed
its wtf momment all over again
METROPOLIS

eenope
God the clipping
THE CLIPPING
I-Is this death?!
This game blurs the line between reality and fantasy.
Is this how death will be like?!
Oh my god, he's hollow inside!
otakon: Youre in th floor. What do you expect
This is Purgatory... You should see hell
WTF
rofl
That was unexpected
Someone needs to make a comic book adventure based on this game, including the glitches.
Hi everypony
Petrified_Discord: it's like a trainwreck on LSD.

It's not a glitch, it's an effect
hi

DISCORD is joining forces with Lex Luger!
Pale_Horse: dat Simpson joke :D
?
you?
hehe
NICE
wow, bullshit
So SuperBrony64, any other advice you have for my N64 problem? The red light on the system turns on, so I think that means the system itself works.
Goddamn this game is an affront to humanity
11,01You lose *cutscene*
How do you become a streamer?
What if the glitches in this game were intentional? Just to showcase Lex's poor virtual reality programing?
Dark92Enigma: i could see that happening lol
Hahahahaha. Hahahahaha. Hahahahaha.
Dark92Enigma discord is teaming up with the total package?
otakon I agree it is an afront
kinda realized
testing...
Maid_Discord: Ikr
hiya Dken2021
defeat an old streamer
They FOCUSED ON THAT BULLSHIT?!
god i love this game
exactly the same
otakon hai, my connection's beiong crap
starstrong please expalin why
starsong: it's so baaaad :D
golden eye all over again
Of all the things to focus, they focus on the goddamn mirror effect in ONE ROOM
/me 11,01waxes starsong
lunac: so bad its good maybe?
kinky
it is just so good...
sagas NO
lunac: in a funny ironic sense

lunac: WHY are you complaing though?
God it hurts

IT HURTS!
The Lex has been...sextupled? I dunno :/
that static is static!
because it;s all I can do
eeyup, that isstatic

AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGHHHHHH
Spitfire it is as I cannot contol the stream
that's easy
fapplebloom: in this game yes, at least in the animated series they made SM believable
lunac: only mods can control the stream
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
11,02Marx: I don't know what the issue could be...if the Power Supply is faulty, it could be ruining your system when it's in use. I'd be safe and just find a replacement online. None of my Power Supplies have ever had a buzzing sound like that. As for the system not showing anything, it could be an issue with the cartridge reader if it's not the power supply.
sagas you swine!
WALL TEXT
Luthurrrr

Iron_Waffle: Heck yeah. waffles are the answer to everything
Sumerpan!?
SuperBrony64, I'm definitely not gonna turn the system on again until I have it plugged into a known-working power supply. I'm going to go up to Gamestop tomorrow and see if they can help me. Thanks for helping me.
LOL!
lol
so you cant loose that part?
Kencolt why is the evil space god even working for lex luthor
Marx: good luck, happened with my sister's wii once.
NICE BOSS FIGHT
lol
There observing <3
LOL!?
legit
This looks like the worst game ever
...
the hell?
rabidsonic: it is considered as such
That was seriously the dumbest fight in the history of mankind
alexxm NC: IT MAKES NO SENSE!
rabidsonic: No, that would be E.T.
lunac: except not going through rings
That was a fight?
N64 really suffered with aliasing
The Aquaman game was also terrible
luthor was cardboard all along!
alexxm AVGN: Cowabunga?
11,02Marx: Np, though you might do better getting it on Amazon, it's about $10 there :)
lunac: only fighting aliens or supercriminals is dangerous for Supes
DeadlyPon3: the Leader fight in the SNES Hulk game is worse. You literally punch him once and you win.
AVGN: COWAFUCKING PIECE OF DOG SHIT
yea your right
otakon: What about cry of fear?
otakon: Ikr
There's a boss fight
PONY

DeadlyPon3 no he;s not
i love how everyone just notices says. "PONY"

Do you guys need to flip your shit EVERYTIME someone says pony ?
Batman=Luna
Sumerpony :D
Very_Silly_Filly: never heard of it
Sumerpan is pony
Only Pinkie pie jumps like that!
Alister: yush :3c
Alister: YOU SAID PONY AAAAAAHHH
Alister: Pretty much
otakon: Google it, apparently very screwed up
otakon, On that topic, there's a cutscene in Skyward Sword that actually doesn't work properly on my original Wii. Apparently my old Wii can't process the cutscene and freezes every time it tries to run it. Thankfully I had a spare Wii on hand.
Very_Silly_Filly: odl
Walking into the fist of the hero... Like a BOSS
I'm pretty sure the Leader fight was SUPPOSED to be anti-climactic... Cause he dosen't have the super strength to directly fight the Hulk... Of course while that might work for a story it amkes a poor game end boss.
LOTR!
Marx: weird
\_YES_(o)_/\_(o)_NO_/
Insert Rumble pack now...

i have a ps3.
Maid_Discord: kinky
skylerarmor: Same here
so many games i want at 5 bucks but no money right now
I like PS3 for single player games
But I thought I might as well try out a couple of PC games that people always rave about when they're so cheap.
PlayStation Network?
11,01Not a 360 fan. Hate the forced online fee and closed platform.
okay
fapplebloom said go cry to daddy and maid_discord cries to fapplebloom....:O
I don't know how
skylerarmor: Dari_-C-_K
but they made Sweetie Belle CUTER in that.
cyber_pony13: that is what happened, yes
hmmm anybody else have a burning hatred for EA
cyber_pony13: I... am her father
how long is the sale?
fapplebloom: you are the father
cyber_pony13: What is this, Jeremy Kyle?
11,01cratorkid uses flamebait.

You probably won't know who Jeremy Kyle is unless you're from the UK.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=m_m4Nh6HoO4
11,01My first name is Kyle.
so this is a fascinating stream
yeah the buffering circle is best stream
08,01heh, Jeremy Vile
fapplebloom: yeah deadzone happens at times
kirzstryfe ANNO 2070 is awesome, but I didn|t got it via steam or I would have bought the DLC now >&
it's chasing its own tail
if anyone is willing i'll trade my copy of amnesia for borderland goty :p
goddamn so tired
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAsR5jgXnUM - My favorite silly pmv :)
08,01but not as funny
it will catch it's tail one day and when it does...:O
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: dude, just get Borderlands GotY, it's not that expensive
08,01he basically just yells at people
Borderlands goty is like 20 bucks
08,01lunac: not true
I'm actually checking on the KH-a-thon on the HellFire stream, but I can't make up my mind which one to watch. Six people are streaming each of the games at the same time and I don't which one to follow
unless its on sale
otakon already bought some stuff yesterday so no money right now
/me 08,01hugs AttacktheMaid
I remember Jeremy Kyle was on at school once, and the topic was about some guy who had killed someone.
WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE MAID-RELATED NAMES
fapplebloom: maid hour, duh!
i got cut off from the internet for a bit there. yeah, i got slow internet........ got a prob??!?!
Then they started talking about the fact that he hadn't paid the gas bill.
did I miss a board meeting or something?
fapplebloom: It's Maid Hour, of course :3
Because that's clearly more important.
:P
/me 08,01hugs Maid_Discord
do maids drink free during maid hour?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UO1Q5EiYzk :) more sillyness
/me 08,01dusts fapplebloom
and thus the infection spread and all became maid
08,01fapplebloom: nothing, i'm dusting you
http://derpy.me/4UuxN horses and pants
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeaGJRV-whU&feature=related
the others will have to wait for another day - I think posted a majority in the last week or two - wouldnt want them to get stale now would we :)
Why wont this game work!

whoa when did molestia get in here
Well that told you.
fapplebloom: they not a person theya pony
08,01fapplebloom: you were the one hoping for innuendo
cyber_pony13: i don't think she ever leaves
besides dusting someone probably means beating them up
This is a new one - Want it Need it (Hold me) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E20jsywkLaY
*up
11,01Not here.
owloysius: i see, she just waits for her next target and fapplebloom may be it
i meant the slang
alexxm: Blacklight Retribution. It keept say that I have a corrupted files and telling me to reinstall. I reinstall about 10 times!
11,01Dusting means pushing the dust off.
08,01exactly
/me brushise Maidwhile's moustache
08,01with a duster
/me dusting random ponies off
why does everyone hate me...
i know that.

Maid_Discord: nice color! :)
/me watches the chat dust and clean
fapplebloom: im sorry i didnt ask to be a cyborg...they didnt want me to die so they did this to me:'(
this chat just got 20% cleaner lol
13,02I want to voice my own questions when Tavi gets to those in the Moonstuck dub.
BRB guys
lunac: im in a episode:O i get to meet the doctor
Maid_Discord: dear God the colors...they burn.
cyber_pony13: i wanted to die and you wouldn't let me. HYPOCRITE!
Maid_Discord: That colour combo makes me think of bubblegum.
otakon, might wanna get that checked, man. Who knows?
woop woop
Ninjazz|Away: no money man
08,01otakon: have you been to the hospital yet?
Damn... >_<
Ninjazz|Away: can't afford a doctor visit

That sucks, man. :(
13,02otakon: Hurt limb?
fapplebloom: you wouldnt have died from hanging yourself you were still on the chair
08,01your healthcare system... for fuck's sake, seriously
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0coYczBX90&feature=related - Moonstuck part 2
11,01Now we're forced to buy healthcare.
fapplebloom: besides my team being a cyborg has had me learn something
11,01Can't get it for free.
Maid_Discord: think I was partially folded in half crushing a section in between my ribs and stomach for like a second.
because here, Money > someones life

>:(
fapplebloom: *time
I'm afraid I ruptured my stomach or something.
08,01"i have no money so i can't go to the doctor" shouldn't be something that happens in a *civilised* country
11,01Money > everything in the US.
....uh.
cyber_pony13: you never asked for this...
11,01Downside of corporatism.
http://woonastuck.tumblr.com/ - Moonstuck tumblr for the rest of the story :)
11,01Cypresswolf: Find my questions there.
11,01I have three.
I've been gassy(belching and flatuus) and suddenly tired.
Challege Accepted!
I think dyspipsia
08,01is DCD about?
downer...
08,01if you're worried about your injuries, he's the man to ask
lunac: hmmm.... those cyber ponies seem to be the old models so termination for them is imminant
k
fapplebloom: what did i never ask for
cyber_pony13: nevermind, stupid reference
:P
11,01How is government healthcare?
11,01I heard it sucked in Canada.
fapplebloom: that awkwatd moment when others dont get your referemce
fapplebloom: *reference
Maid_Discord: ask Derm if you get the chance
It's okay, i guess.
cyber_pony13: you might have gotten it if you werent a ROBOT
fapplebloom: CYBORG different from robot
11,01I forget. Even when you have healthcare, you still don't want to go to the doctor because health insurance companies can be a pain in the ass to deal with.
Oh, wait, otakon it happened two days ago?
cyber_pony13: sorry
CriticKitten: yeah
Maid_Discord you don;t have to pay to be healed/saved
Who likes Spitfire? :3
fapplebloom: thank you
/me 11,01paints panda
If you'd ruptured your stomach you'd know by now.
CriticKitten: what does that mean? I'm just getting sick?
CriticKitten: phew
YAY! I JUST HAVE A SUMMER FLU!
apparently
or it's stress
still, I feel better that I haven't ruptured anything.

otakon: CONGRATS ON THE SUMMER FLU HERE'S AN INTERNET FOR YOU;)
much better
the other pic confused the apples out of me
11,01I really, really wish I could move abroad (easily).
Maid_Discord: TRAITOR
Obviously check with DCD to be 100% safe, but if you've gone two full days without any significant discomfort in that region, you're likely alright.
Maid_Discord I;d happily welcome you ot he free world
11,01fapplebloom: Not really a traitor. Just hate the govt here.
CriticKitten: yeah, worst I got was a sore neck
Usually if you do something as serious as puncture your stomach, you figure it out pretty quick. Stomach acid isn't fond of your insides. :P
Maid_Discord: where exactly?
CriticKitten: yeah I guess
No discomfort beyond being gassy?
No pain when you sit/stand, that sort of thing?
11,01fapplebloom: Move to Denmark or Sweden.

11,01No. Except for the weapons.
11,01Nice pic.
hey Ponies47
:P
No stream? 6_9
If you're a maid and have powers over time, and you use knives as your main weapon, I loathe you.
Ponies47: The buffer circle is the stream

Ooh, District 9 is on
All Glory To The Buffer Circle!

MaidPetrifiedDiscord: Or... A parasprite infestation of your internet *nods*
confound you delightful ponies. Trying to work on Fan Fic but all of you are to interesting
alexxm: Will it?
So I saw the new Spiderman movie. It was pretty good.
I used to write fanfics. But then I realized I suck at them.
Now I resort to drawing.
So, since nobody ever answered my question, I'm assuming that our delightful group here doesn't extend into antisocial media circles?
MaidRevenge: O_O *turns on PinkiePie_Antivirus.exe*
WindWhistler: you and me both
If I could draw them well enough...
alexxm: D:
I can't draw ponies. Or at least not their bodies.
11,01MaidRevenge: What question?
i have no idea
/me *snapflash PING MaidPetrifiedDiscord *snapflash
Maid_Discord: As to whether we have a Bronystate Facebook group so that I could contact people outside of this little black box
MaidRevenge: It's called being ignored. Welcome to the club. Have a seat next to me.
11,01MaidRevenge: We do.
/me spots an Aya

WindMaid_VIVIT: No, I meant who was streaming District 9 around Thanksgiving last year.
SparkleButt: sounds entertaining

OohShiny Dude, everyone did
Wow, chat popped out for a sec
Heimerdinger is OP i know cause i'm using it.
I admire the dedication going into this tile
AttacktheAndalite: that's okay, Zuul doesn't need logic
The finale could have been a movie all on its own, but it was due to time restraints that it was shorter
MahBoi777: *still confused*
Well, Haku is leaving

13oh my
YAY
13that pine is...
/me 13lowers her glasses
yaay
13KNOOOOOTTTYYYYYYYY
8,6lol >.<
XD
Shizuka: YEEEEEEEEEEEAH
yaay!
:D
13^~^
Vordox: sure
13Cypresswolf: baskets can be used too, the half baskets sometimes play nicer
anyone shaking the head?
13but yeah sometimes the smaller rocks land too low and you just start walking over
Damnit, hickupp
May I please have some people attention here.
13heimerdinger meisterburger?
sup bro?
LoL.
Vordox: What's up?
There has been another one of those "Disc Content, but needs to be unlocked via Online" again
/me stares at Vordox O_O
?
13what a shock
what?
Like the ME3 Quest/Story part already in the disc but needed to be bought/released
As in, League of Legends.
I'm going to go out for a bit for some food first - might take a while to finish Teledahn, then I want to get a little way through Edar Kem
disc content?
13sorry
/me 13puts her deus ex shades on
13Vordox: what a shame
what is he talking about?
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: maybe it is all three combined
This has happened again to another game, although it is beloved until this sudden interest that came up about 2 months ago when a hacker decided to go through the disc
White Knight Chronicles 2
Shizuka: What's the point of the shades and stuff Shizuka ?
What's wih the IRc server, it's borked big time.
And while it's somewhat relevant, Corki needs to crash his plane off a cliff.
Borkborkbork.
oh how fun it is to be apart of a community of ponies http://derpy.me/MGPhX
:3 Just saw the A movie winner. YAY
D: Chat is ded?
LadyCanary: Chat is borked. Takes forever to write and to recieve
Oh dearie me.
i has no idea what that means :p
Apparently.
Looks more like a split.
Allo LadyCanary.
Hihi.
You me and Vordox appear to be the only ones on this side of whatever's going on that aren't dead.
Meanwhile: Indeed. And Spectrum
Seems so.

Vordox1: What's the petition for?
It's the same incident as with the ME3 On Disc inciden
However, this is with another game.
CrimsonPhoenix: wow:O
White Knight Chronicles 2 to be preice.

Ohhh. I know nothing about games, unfortunately :(

It just started 3 days ago, and we're trying to get some attention to it
i hate corky too and ok you will be the spy
HIDE YOUR KIDS, HIDE YOUR WIFE THE CHATS SENTIENT!
from where that music is?
However, Wk2 is pretty much hardcore fan base of smaller amount of people, so every signature is highly important
I heard the sound that plays when there's 100 seconds left in super Mario Bros when I got kickd
8,6last song was Party of One Rescore
oh kickbots acting up?
I will? what?
What are we talkingabout?

/me pokes Tom~ "Are you real?~"
I wonder who

13tom is no more sentient than my turkey sandvich
I assume it's an IRCop, since Tom has IRCop powers.

DropDeadBrony: Monday.
Hoi everypony

Sylandest: glad to hear it, I'm doing great:)
Hey Unnr|Laptop :P
hey Unnr|Laptop
fast Shizuka is fast
I'm sensing you want a good game.
Aww Shizu I know that you hate newfoals but you've got to stop being mean to them.
Hows everypony this mornign?
Unnr|Laptop: Fine thank you :P
you think?
13i do not hate newfoals, but i am frustrated by ponies that won't take two seconds to find an answer themselves... especially when we spent months on making the site easier to use...
Unnr|Laptop: doing great how are you?
Up early, watching cheesy movies. ^^
Newfoals can't searchforce.
I have plenty of wonderful games that are as awesome as realistic. Like Skyrim, and Minecraft?
Jus kiddin about last part thou
my creativity ran out
I have no creativity what so ever :/
You could've went full nintendo since I said defy realism
in which case means that I wanted something not realistice
realistic**
ah Okay
and yeah I'm an nintendork
How about Super Mario, Sonic or Legend of Zelda?
How about no no or no?
better but cooler
There's so many wonderful games the likes of that
Meanwhile, we're having fun here no need for you to ruin it
I'll have you know that it is my lifes goal to ruin your fun.

Or perhaps you want a old game from the atari?
Now you're talking

8,6bread is yummy ^_^
nom bread nom
It's easy to choose now
kirzstryfe: eeyup :3

No but I have Polistatyon!
old chinese video game with so many things to play
i heard that Shizuka likes bread http://derpy.me/z3sjr :p
13mmmmmmm
what to do what to do, *gasp* a score that's it, there's only just one way
to find out what entertainment's best
Hold a review of gameplay, visual and sound,
that will put each things in here to the teeeeeeest.
Don't forget graphics for that age, that should be considered
then we would be sure who's best of the living room
The one who is awesome as cool
jus like me
So a review we will see
can't settle for less cause I'm a dork so a review we will see
ok I give up i have no idea what the drawing is supposed to be
for the number 1 greatest and perfectest thing in the world for meeeeee
kidzrul434: a bakery?
kidzrul434 a bakery ?
May the games begin
and may the best thing win
and may the odds be ever in your favour
oops.
I think they didn't even know what we were talking about
seriously though that was the silliest thing I've ever did in a chatroom
they just ignored
OohShiny: it's a song parody you were doing, i just forgot
8,6the odds can never be in your favor, because the game is I Win
8,6and as soon as you start playing, you lose, because I win :P
kirzstryfe: i'm the world champ, you know
dem jurassic park
kirzstryfe i apply murphy's law to your game
and here I just wanted to know whether I would watch star trek or play Alice
Can somepony help me out with Steam?? :o
lol crimson, gave you a lot of choices now
xD
RaveBrony, steam is slow because of sales
but I would suggest Star Trek, because I don't what alice's about
Alice Madness Returns
Nono, i just bought a 2 game thingy and i need to know how to send one to my friend D:
I know the name, but never heard of it
RaveBrony, did you bought it as gift?
oh wait it's a pack right?
Evening, all.
crimson, it's up to you anyway
It told me i had to buy it for myself first then send it afterward
Evening, regulars.
It didnt give me the option to buy it as a gift
Heyo.
btw if someone wants amnesia: the dark decent i'm trading it for a copy of borderlands GOTY :p

Speaking of which, what IS on stream? It seems to be Wrek drawing, but I can't recognize WHAT he's drawing oh
*facepalm
RaveBrony, on steam client, click view then inventory
kirz draws? Huh, that's a new one on me.
wat's with the dinosaur?
Eyup. He does. I think this is his entry for the art contest.
Open the door get on the floor everybody walk the dinosaur.

Oh! ty, CrimsonPhoenix :)
Dat bread raptor is adorable.

Indeed. :3
A bread raptor?
13oh my
I like your bread raptor, kirzstryfe. You gonna keep him?

I want one of those bread raptors.
I'd settle for a regular one.
13you bread raptors?
Dat pun.
RaveBrony: there be a stream :$
8,6lol >.<
-_(\
13how do you know all the bread on jurassic park is female?
Double-ds required.
And then I'd keep it under the bed and it would eat all the insects that fly in my room.
MahBoi777: I see that now that i refreshed! :$
and hiya!
:P
None of it can park?
I would be the COOLEST KID ON THE BLOCK
hey RaveBrony! :)
Oh, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 are both on 75% discount.
75%? Damn, everyone go buy that so we have more zombie game people.
dafuq?
he's wearing a dress?
Meanwhile: With what money?
I can't buy international stuff
With the money from...I don't know, the ether.
The chat crashed on me :/
wubwubwubwubwub
Nightmare Moon
lol
Ok :I
I have no clue what that is, and I don't think I want to know.
Ooooh, Materializing Money, awesome
Bread Raptor, such a majestic creature
oh, and it's a typo
it's Aether
8,6that's a bread raptor with a skirt :P
not ether
/me still would just settle for some bread
It's adorable. :3
What's her name, kirzstryfe?
8,6because how can you tell all the bread raptors are female if you don't go out into the bakery and lift up their skirts? :3
it's well bread
awwwwww
>_>
kirz if there is one thing on my mind when I see a raptor made of bread wearing a skirt it isn't "I wonder what gender that is"
I wouldn't.
:D
kirzstryfe what no handbag ?
kirzstryfe: i don't think you can tell for dinosaurs
It would eat your moth, Meanwhile.
and i'm scared of the raptors
Well, with that in mind, I'm going to bed. Night everypony.
gnight Meanwhile
Night... :/
Ninjazz: dat feel mang
You knows it. :c
I knows it. T_T
it sure got silent
Through all the chats. >_>
there was a netsplit a few seconds ago
I wonder if this is just ded chat... or LAAAAAAG...
*minutes
Oh man... expect 100 messages soon.
I can feel it. >_<
ikr
/me braces
/me dives for cover

>_>
<_<
>_<
>.<
You wish you had a bread raptor.
kirzstryfe: You can try but you'll probably get your face clawed off for it.
i don't know why people look forward to them
8,6you get sticky, actually, they all have bear claws >.>
....
kirzstryfe: I'm not sure where that logic came from but I've decided not to question it.
13pssst buy l4d1 instead, it's better
Still....you'd end up with a messed-up face, provided it lets you live
Silly Shizu, why get one when you can get both? :P
The pair of 'em together is just 7 and a half bucks.
Five bucks for L4D and L4D2 each? Good lord I love Steam.
Warning, epic gif incoming
/me wishes she had money to buy a new laptop and both games
http://i.imgur.com/HlNm1.gif
5 per game or the pair for 7.50, 's pretty damn good. XD
Sweet, CrimsonPhoenix. You did that/
Also if you don't already own it, you have a bit under 2 hours left to get KOTOR for $2.49, gogogogogogogogo.
Mmmm kotor
AttacktheAndalite, nah I suck at drawing
what's kotor?
13eh kotor was... eh...
CrimsonPhoenix: Still, it's badass
13never finished
knight of the old republic
Oh hai Bronystate, what did enter into?
Hi OmegaMetroidBrony
But KotOR has HK-47
hi O
Shizu: Doncha mean KOTOR2?
oops
13never played that
That was the one that didn't get finished.
13got like 10 hours into kotor 1 though... still not sure what happened
The first one was by Bioware pre-EA suckage.
8,6probably got to the grasslands and it exploded the computer
00,10eeeeyup
13i think i stopped around some grassy land
13not cause kimiko blew up but because i was terribly bored
00,10graslands killed my comp and that was like 8 years after the game came out
And yeah, Unnr has a point. KOTOR is worth the 2 and a half bucks for HK-47 alone.
00,10now the game just wont run
why do i assume this is the pillows
00,10cause it is the pillows
oh good.
He, by himself, constitutes the full purchase price.
till later guys
Later, OohShiny
I am kinda bored

http://images.alexonsager.net/pokemon/fused/12/12.57.png BUTTERAPE
When you try to eat a bread raptor, it's a competition.
...
It's a contest of strength and wills.
8,6got a bit of a spike there as well dari
Bread raptor is a man's food.
What caused that?
8,6lol
Nothing feels better than getting lag auto kicked. =_=
Ninjazz: funny i was gonna warn ya bout that and then it happened :D
Spectrum_Rush|shrugs, that would have been helpful.
sorry i type slow on my mac
book
:T
i sense another wave spike incoming its to slow to soon
00,10woooooooh man, thunder erey where all of a sudden.
THUNDER.
wait....

THUNDAHSTRUCK
I was kicked for....six messages....but I didn't speak for a good two minutes?

it's in goddamn steam
CriticKitten: Lol
why do I need to make a goddamn account in origin for it...
yo!
Hello
Eyush.
Wat?
8,6CrimsonPhoenix, because [insert Nittany_Discord rant #5]
fuck
CrimsonPhoenix: Because EA hates you.
Well EA is shit
That's the only logical rationale for most of their decisions. :D
EA hates everything... except money.
EA loves money.
but still since it's in steam why bother
oh crap i just realized tht the song is Art of the Dress XD
Isn't EA doing poorly right now? I remember Nitt mentioning something of the sort.
8,6lol
Ninjazz: of course
Oh, EA is doing poorly?
Well that means we're in for a bad time. =_=
No, Nitt's just hopeful because their stocks have gone down.
I'm sure they would take that the same way, though. :S
its always fun to see someone who can actually draw
Whelp, if 4kids went bankrupt, then I'm sure EA can pull off the same feat.
o hey this is art of the dress
Good morning everypony :)
Morning killerpony7733 :)
mornin killerpony7733
Heyo, killerpony7733.
Ninjazz: Nintendo's stocks went down after E3 too. I'd wager the number of fucks given approaches zero
morning killerpony7733
Morning, killerpony7733
i just said that XD
CriticKitten: But then, this is Nintendo we're talking about. EA and Nintendo are two very different buckets
its evening over here XD
CriticKitten: The difference being that one is full of holes while the other is merely under a bright light.
i cant draw worth shit :'(
Jspang1: Practice until your hand goes numb.
Reikim: Almost everyone's stocks went down after E3. It was just a shitty E3 performance in general.
You're not alone, Jspang1
Reikim: It's hardly indicative of the company failing.
Reikim: i dont have that kind of time on my hands
00,10Badnews, I managed to find the B movie
volume is too loud
CriticKitten: I won't argue there. Though there were moments in E3, they were far too far between.
Sumica: That's bad how?
Sumica: English or French?
Sumica, and?
00,10English
OMG
Oh man
What's the B movie?
English dub of a French movie
lunac: theres a magic button on your comp thats called the volume control
This is going to be glorious.
00,10it reminds much of 3DO zelda
Oh god.
Sumica: Trust me, it's one of those movies taht grows on you
.D
Sumi. This is a GOOD THING.
That never happened Sumica.
Sumica: ya mean philips cd-i
00,10I keep haveing urges to go Maiboi
Suger Cube Corner background?
00,10yeah that
CD-I ftw
Lol
Not the CD-i
Sumica: Well it's classic cartoon :P
*shudder*
Sumica, are you insulting the french?
whut we talking bout?
Sumica: Mah boi! This badness is what all true B-movies strive for!
i hate this remix
Ah yes this song
Aww this song
MahBoi777: All I have to say is CD-i Zelda
00,10no the movie does it fine
YEAYEHHH
the original was so much better
MahBoi777: Mah boi, this peace is what all true warriors strive for.
MahBoi777: the CD-I is what all true warriors strive for MAHBOI
good morning :)
Oh, also, I has L4D1/2 nao, ~yay~ I have a shooter that I can play and suck at while people laugh at me! :D
because I say, the movie is way better animated than CD-I zelda

Dark Side of Phobos is a good OST
Unnr|Laptop: Hilariously it's not an OST. It's a fan remix album :P
About the second most awesome thing to come from OC remix
This is the BEST POSSIBLE THING
Unnr|Laptop: First?

Oh yeah guys

8,6is anyone else getting sound distortions, or just Monotone?
SWAG
I'm not getting anything
So what's this new song?
kirzstryfe: im not
13Prophecy - Iron Cathedral (e3m8), same album
I'm liking the percussion here
Slight drop in audio quality, I would say.
But that's probably intentional.
*carries BFG around*
/me 13is streaming music to kirz to draw
Wait. Wait. Wait. Shizu is streamin music while kirz is drawing?

Psssst guys

/me listens kind of
http://derpy.me/U2Ixp
I don't think you want to do that, sir.
Shizuka: are we experiencing slight streamception?
Is this the same song?
waht Shizuka is saying is there is a streamception going on... and we were known the wiser
13yes
oh GOD DISCORD:'(
creepy
We need to go deeper.
This track reminds me slightly of...erm...the City of the Ancients in FF7.
Shizuka: dat myst
Very ambient piece of music.
sounds so creepy
*shudders*
/me hugs everypony
it reminds me of Dahlia Hawthorne from Ace Attorney
Can we get more OC Remix please? But only if you want, of course.

Oh man
Never mind

^_^
8,6Shizuka's in control of the radio now, and I like what she's picking, so you're stuck with no requests :P

Monotone: Oooh, I know what your problem is
dat SaxyPretender outa nowhere
Im Sonic!
HI IM SONIC

Monotone: Your stream is lagging, and the distortion you get is what happens when it jumps to catch up.
13dat shading <3
Monotone: No way to fix it other than to get a better connection.
So..
0,14dat Kiss From a Rose

yo!
Shizuka: you're playlist site is broken
13Reikim: they're both from the advent children movie
sounds like the good 80's music
Ah, you have it down here as FFV.
i just totally read Advent Chicken..
"file://C:\Users\Shizuka\AppData\Local\Temp\WHT5774.tmp.html" in potpourri.html
there's no music at all...
13i do?
Yeah
13maidlicious: because that's not a relevant link to you
okay...
"Nobuo Uematsu - Sara ni Tatakau Monotachi (FFV (4:24)" < Shizu's Potpourri Playlist
13it's just what winamp dumps out is all
man it sounds so much like an 80's song
13oh i see the problem

13the tag cut off the name, it should be "FFVII AC Version'
13let me put it on

Shizu, do you mebbe know where you got that album?

Eh, I'll find it
Danger Zone
Shizuka: your 404 and 403 pages are broken. They link to haruko.styes.net
13it's from one of my deeper archives which means i got it somewhere before 2007
0,14also, this is from FF7 movie?
Rainbow Danger Zone Dash
13maidlicious: haruko's not much of a maintained box, not webserver wise
oh.
13i've moved the relevant stuff up to vortalcord proper, haruko's just there as a fast way to get a doc online
13and irc
i see.
13let me find danger zone
I have a bit of a dillema here. I have 3 items up for deep discount right now. And I only have enough money in my Steam wallet for one of them.

/me 13ducks the bits of flying saxy everywhere
0,14HIGHWAY TO THE DANGER ZONE
whats the song? the video isnt playing...
yay Danger ZONE
Well, maybe I could frame the question like this: does anyone have an extra free copy of Frozen Synapse, and looking for someone to give it to?
13Monotone: if you hear the music, the video is playing, he is doing fine details though so not much changes from frame to frame
heh?
Top Gun Dashie
0,14I think I played an Ace Combat mission and had this song playing
the music isnt playing and i dont have it on mute...
I always heard the lyrics as "Fly in to the Danger Zone"
13i always thought it was that too
Monotone: Then your stream is broken. *gives duct tape*
Kandarihu: ...It's not?
definitely something dashie would do
13i mean i know it's highway but you just can't unhear "fly in to" once you do..
damn...
00,10so Hub had a trolly in San Deigo done up in ponies eh?
I guess it's not. You always heard it as that too?
8,6if you were having sound issues before and it's dead now Monotone, it's either a connection issue on your end, or your sound card died
8,6or headphones
yep
Yeah, I always heard it as "fly in to the danger zone"
NVM I JUST REFRESHED IT!
Either way is cool, really.
0,14yep
0,14THE DANGER ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE
Sumica: neat

I need to deal with this quickly. One of the discounts I'm wanting to juggle expires in under an hour
Any time I think about jets I think about Macross, inevitably.
13wish i could :/
0,14also, I played the demo for the new Top Gun game
Then I think about Macross Plus and its soundtrack gets in my head and I'm stuck that way for an hour or so.

13hard to queue up the next track when it jumps the playlist from under me...
Are we going to see more L4D on the stream in the forseeable future?

Hey everypony.

Spoilers are means of ruining your priceless reaction when you see it live
/me higs MahBoi777 back :3
13this song comes from a little known game called Dethkarz from like 1999 i think
XD
13somewhere around there
Is it like the Silver Surfer game? Cruddy game, stellar soundtrack?
@SaxyPretender: omg ur right!
13just about
0,14XD
/me 11,01hugs Shizuka
13but anyway, so it's that late 90s game soundtrack is actually tracks on the CD right?
WOW, I just realized that I just really pushed the boundaries there.
13so when i plugged this in to rip it, no matter where i did it, media player always thought it was the Deep Purple best of album
13so this one happens to be "called" Space Truckin
11,01No hug back :<
/me 13hugs Maid_Discord <3
/me laughs

I gots it.
Dermathil: im a suprise kind of guy. i can see where your coming from though
13sadly there is no "smoke on the water" track in here, but what's funny is the track names go pretty well with the tracks themselves
0,14Spoiler alert: you all are awesome :3
13"black night" is this kind of ambient thing used for the menu, "speed king" and "fireball" sound like they should be racing game songs
I thought the rule was no spoilers, Saxy. :/
:O
SaxyPretender: NO SPOILER!
Dammit, Saxy! You ruined the surprise. Ruined it FOREVER.
0,14;___;
Spoiler alert: Fighting is Magic stream was awesome
I think I might be well justified in asking that of Shizuka. But it doesn't make what I said okay.
13missed it
Spoiler Alert: 2001 A Space Odyssey has a sequel.

Ugh
13Force-A-Nem - Mmph the Way You Mmph
SaxyPretender: It's based on some Rhianna song.
0,14ah
brb
13remix of Love the Way You Lie by Eminem + Rhianna
Well, what he said technically applies to me after almost telling Shizuka what to stream. So it's a very untrue spoiler, that we're all awesome.
This Scout is the best rapper ever
13ah, nah i don't stream l4d cause asuka already hates me enough for playing it
klolwut
Eminem got nothing on this shit
13streaming source is out for a while til i disassemble my desk and dust everything
Kandarihu: You didn't tell Shizu what to stream, not that I saw. Just asked whether it will be streamed in the future.
Wait Shizuka, you didn't just referenced P&SwG?
O.o TF2 scout
13CrimsonPhoenix: i figured i was referencing the minecraft video where a guy uses blue dye on wool and someone freaks out that it's against the rules
uberhaxxornova
Back :P
wb ponibas
nope
lol^
Scout rap? 6_9
Ponies47:

wow scout is best rapper
ImmaPonyLuvr: TY :)
Ponies47: welcome
Where was this fabled reference?
SEE I'M NOT CRAZY
:D how is blue dye against the rules anyway - that vid was hilarious
13[23:32] *** SaxyPretender was kicked from #bronystate by [Shizuka] [YOU BROKE THE RUUUURUUUUUUUUSU]
SaxyPretender: your face is abit messed there, you all right
13sometimes a shizu is a shizu
Yeah, yeah I'd see that as a PaSwG reference.
0,14what face?
Shitzus are dogs...

nm saxy i'm tired and seeing things
This is kind of funny. ?_?

ImmaPonyLuvr, look up
no spoiler
Can we stop talking about spoilers? Please?
Scout > Eminem
now shush before you get ban
this just makes me want to listen to the slap chop scout ad again :)
Not even discussing spoilers. Discussing spoilers leads to spoilers.
yeah, no spoilers...
wait...
13this song kinda messes me up when it comes up during tf2
13can't imagine why :3
dat scout
Dunno why, you never play medic.
no idea
Ah this song
Yeah, let's not talk about spoilers; save the drama for until the show actually airs ;)
classic
I wonder if 75% off L4D will come up for vote again after this.
0,14AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Dat UnanimousDelivers
13for a while i played nothing but medic...
Shizuka: I suck at TF2 in general. I got practice more :P
oh boy
13was pretty good with arcing the needler
fuck yeah
13but then i went pyro and never looked back
omg who made this remix?
We all go through that phase, Shizu. Simply because Medic is the easiest noob class.
/me does the fukkireita
13so much more versatile, though i have to be in the right frame of mind to be useful
OOOHHH YEEAAAHHH'
ImmaPonyLuvr: UnanimousDelivers
PONIES!
Shizuka: I try to be a diffrent class everytime but I've played as Heavy most :P
do you believe in magic~
<3<3<3
thanks AttacktheAndalite
13i couldn't get into heavy cause he's so slow
Shizuka: and you have all the best gear supplyed by sham co. the ony store to not charge you 20 refined for a fucking flamethrower

Shizuka: He's slow. But his gun! Since the last time I've played on your server I've found 2 more guns for Heavy :3
Did you say something, Saxy? :3
0,14Shamwow? >.>
Ooh, Spy is fun if you get in the right place.
I try getting the whole team to go Soilder for lulz
SaxyPretender.....wut????
hey Polydunami!^^
13i really can't stand playing engie under normal circumstances... have to treat every pixel as a spy...
when it all works out its epic
Hey MahBoi777
Shizu is paranoid filly.
Shizuka....thats why we have tower defense
0,14I made a bad shamwow joke
I see why she plays Pyro.
13if i wanted to have to pay attention to everything on screen i'd go play a rts

I know I certainly helped, SaxyPretender :$
11,01Spy is a dispenser.

THE ENGI IS A...0_o mai gawd
what art progam is he using?
13ja if shizu gets you in melee range and isn't being crippled by ping, you're up against a wall und axed
but Shizuka, what if the spy is you?
11,01Spy is a spy.
Shizuka ENGIE IS SPY
13and then shizu was the spy
"Im in dispair"
Shizuka: Engie is ok but it gets annoying after a while having to keep repairing your stuff. But a few nights ago. I was on onw of the Ponyfortress 2 server and there was me and 2 other engies we worked together to make sure I sentrys, teloports, and such we're all working :P

Oh SaxyPretender you have Steam?

Shizuka: Recursive streamception? :O
Well, I guess my enthusiasm for L4D dropped enough that I'm dropping this.
Shizuka: dat almost slip
13frozen synapse is a deep game if that's your plan b, wish i didn't fall out of it
13my brain has been too scrambled lately to support strategizing
frozen synapse also has a glorious OST.
13^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I haven't even played the game and I know this.
13imma put more of that on after simcity gets out of the way
I'll go for Knights of the Old Republic for now, and see about recharging my Steam Wallet tomorrow, before Frozen Synapse's discount expires.
...I give up on writing. Shizu's music just makes it impossible.
Dang, those Pirates actually have a winning season for once.
In a good way.
If someone would be willing to give me a complimentary copy, I'd be easily able to afford the DLC.
And the OST
13sorry... if it makes you feel better i have to drop over to a thunderstorm track to get focused for writing... and i still can't
You buy the music now? :O
13thought the OST comes with
Don't worry, your music is good.
So how about those Astros jumping leagues?
13or no wait that's the first copy, the extra is just the game
The Bastion OST is sooo goood
I'm just not in the right mood for writing, and the music isn't suited to what I'm trying to write.
13the red dlc comes with its ost though
And I can't shut off the music, because I'm chalking up a massive list of music to go look at thanks to this.
13:3
:P
back)
Think I'm gonna try some Brawl. Anyone else got a copy of the game and willing to play?
00,02lol, you cant buy one copy
I feel like I'm in space.
00,02you want frozen synaps, your getting 2 copies
Well, did.
forget you
Not anymore.
13Phase4: the red dlc adds coop so :)
13but you still have to join us for uru
Well, howdy there, Ninjazz!
Hey there, Polydunami! ^_^
13we need like... eight or nine people do to the neighborhood puzzle age
... I wish there was an Applejack emote :S
00,02that i do
It's starting to look like I won't be able to add any more money to my Steam until next month.
00,02Shizuka, when you going on uru next?
This track is just causing me to trance out.
Phase4: what? your buying frozen synapse? nice
Oh well, I'm not on the web client, so what do I care?
00,02Shamroc, actually i'm gona see if i cant nick someone elses free copy and just buy the soundtrack and dlc
00,02i'm much lower on money than i thought i was
Phase4...hehehe cheap cheap cheap its 6 bucks for the game and dlc man
13i forget if i got the two pack..
Polydunami: http://www.friendshipismagic.org/forum/misc.php?do=getsmilies&editorid=dbtech_vbshout_editor13 - all the pony smilies you'll ever need - just wont appear on the stream :)
Wait...free copies?
What?
steam is hilarious. I have 10 versions of visual c++
... That link is kind of large :$
00,02Shamroc, no, i'm seriously low on money, checked my balance today
13Reikim: frozen synapse comes as a two pack i think, you get one (plus OST), and an extra copy to give to someone
You've been taking enhancement drugs, Cypresswolf?
13it's a multiplayer game at heart
Huh. That's a good marketing strategy.
13hey look shamrocs is on stream
13SIIIIIIIGN
Phase4...dang must suck...at least you have some money
SIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGNNNNNNNNN
Omen?
Actually, don't you think that might be spamalicious, all those emotes?
any deals from yesterday on steam end in 10 minutes get waht ya can before it ends
11,01I'll be playing the SP the most or MP against friends.
Spectrum_Rush|shrugs: On a computer tht doesn't have Steam :/
*that
13you can two player coop through the singleplayer campaign with the red dlc
spamaliciouse, no - none are really programed to appear on this stream - but messengers and other forums, maybe :3
Jesus, Shizu's playlist is lulling me to sleep...
is the binding of isaac good?
13hmmm... wakeup music..... hmmmm :3
wait Shizuka are you sure thats me? i dont see a scout or heavy holding it......the need to protest some more
But it's probably a good thing if we all sleep.
/me yawns
13i need more tracks in this style
Moar trance is good, yes
13but i like to stumble across stuff myself
13for instance this i found in a AMV of mahjong
wat
13ikr
Ooh, what's this song playing? I like it.
0,14oooh, this sounds cool
Shizuka: a mahjong amv? what
Mahjong has never been this cool.
]
This sounds slightly Japanese.
13Keiichi Suzuki - FESTIVO
Hay
I shall looks it up
13was a very well done video, conveyed the tempo well
Shizuka, look up the wipeout 2097 soundtrack, its mid 90s but its electronic gold
13reminds me of riverdance a bit too
I'm bored
Poke me
/me pokes insane

There's a very...primal vibe to this song
DX I'm still bored

Brb
you don't point out the ninja behind the curtains. It's rude
13especially the end cause in audiosurf i usually have an 11+ combo built up and it ends perfectly
Not that I really mind, it's not I who made anyone who they are.
I heard my mom talking to my sister while she was in the bath
annd?
thats just weird
... Yeah, I'm exhausted.
Sounds more like Trance to me...
13Brainchild - Symmetry C (Lange Remix)
Shizuka has best playlist
And she said CLEAN YOU PRIVATE PARTS OR THEY WILL FALL OFF AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE THEM!
O.o
insane: im gonna pretend you just didnt say that ok
that seems like an unnecessary story
There's a fly on my screen

Ok xD
You are what you name yourself, insane :3

http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/july-15-officially-brony-appreciation.html
Brony appreciation day is when bronies appreciate the rest of the world for tolerating our existence.
Oh no wait. Brony Apperciation Day on the 15th? 6_9
Right?
tolerating us?
WE'RE supposed to tolerate everyone else in the world
yup
Yes? No? Maybe? The 15th? 6_9
yes, today is 15th
for some
13these mosquitoes man... they have it in for me...
I don't even CARE what other people think about the fanbase. They don't like us, that's THEIR problem.
dont forget our UK friends
8,6well 1) No idea why anyone actually gives a shit about other people that feel the need to look down on someone for something they enjoy; and 2) Love and Tolerate is a line too many people use to hide their own intolerance of others
YES! I'm going to Six Flags later today! Well it's 12:21 AM here. But anyways I'm gonna be wearing my DJ PON-3 shirt there! ^^
Shizuka: Nah, they just want your blood so they can feed it to their hundreds of babbies who will in turn want your blood to feed their babbies and I'm not helping am I.
Love and tolerate is the brony motto
huh.
:S
13nope they're just going to change their tactics now
13they know you're on to them
So apparently somebody's been trying to use my account today.
Six Flags?
there are a ton of Six Flags
On here, RAWRity?
00,10love and tolerate was just a counter troll, noting more nothing less
which one you'll go?
it wasnt me
11,01Shizuka: Fetch the sprays of death!
is there any thing on streem right now my pc laging :$
Polydunami: eeyup. 2 failed attempts at guessing my passward since around noon.
RAWRity: how do you have a password on here?
RAWRity: Well at least they're failed attempts.
nothing onstream rainbow
Sumica: that's the 4chan interpretation. others made more of it
Pudge: You register the nick and add a password to it
just da buffer show
ohh, never knew
how do you do it?
Erm. Can we skip on the debates about our fanbase's core meaning?
:V
/me 13is going to go get halfway through a rifftrax then bed
I'm not really awake enough for it.
11,01You can't stream half a rifftrax.

/me sets Bronystate as her home page in Chrome
despite killing my whole team
therainbowvortex:hai :3/
Have you ever had that feeling where you can feel the entire world changing around you and you can't tell whether it's falling apart or just rearranging itself?
/me 11,01gets sucked into therainbowvortex
Reikim: I know the feel
The bucking chat crashed agian. My dads computer sometimes -_-
I know the world is changing at ALL times
But you don't notice at all times.
yes I do
Reikim: not really. changes all the time and most of the time I have no idea what's going on

yay i'm registered
11,01Get me out of this vortex!
I notice that there is less oxygen and more carbon oxide in this room every time I breath
Sometimes I sit up and I can feel time flowing right past me. Slipping away like butter between my fingers, now becoming a moment ago, the future becoming the past without me having done anything significant.
/me pulls Nittany_Discord out of the vortex
nighr friends \:3/
/me 13throws nittany a water pipe and a leather belt
now bored
God I should sleep.
Who will stream?

Pinkie's song was too much "BAM BAM BAM" no finess D:
was that oc drawn by hand
The_Browncoat, what oc?
it wasn't
I love this song, and Twilight's Sonata, the song it's (partially) based off of.
therainbowvortex,**
it's sprites
00,10if you count a hand on a mouse then yes
the one with the green mane
0,14love this part
it's sprites
oooh
That brass
was it drawn by hand
spriteart
SaxyPretender: IKR?
That brass section kicks me in the balls every time
yeah usually they are mouse made
0,14iirc, it's based off At The Gala and has a snippet of the mane theme
epicepicepicepicepic
for pixelprecision
Twilight Have a Freakin Kamehameha on the game.
i'm loving this teheme
so playful<3
Sumica: was this made with instruments or computer?
00,10I kinda like rbd88's songs better
computer
SaxyPretender: Also this song is partially based off of Twilight's Sonata, IIRC
obviously
If I go to Cantorlot Gardens. I hope to try out Fighting is Magic ^^
Okay, let's see how Rarity's song is.
;)
Sumica: i love you ^^
0,14same, Sumica
Is this the official song?
yes
00,10yeah
I don't recognize this
0,14yeah, this is Rarity's theme
Oh there it is
chills
Carousel Boutique, Best song in the game ;)
00,10they are all from mane6's youtube page
So far, Pinkie was about 4/10, Rarity here have...whoa, Suspence and build up. O.o So far so good, and Twi theme fits her, playful but gentle <3 7/10 for Twi.
Let's see Rarity
Rarity's Music have to be stylish
It's very...dunno how to describe it...
love this song
Why does this song remind me so much of the mine theme from DKC2?
Like the smooth blade of a sharp knife
11/10 for Twi's theme
Twilight/10
00,10this has a touhou feel
I'm liking this, Very Touhouish.
Indeed Sumica
i was told yesterday that the green pony was an oc
Muffin/10 for Twilights :3
For me, it's the same key, actually xD
twilight is Over9000/10
Sumica: That's probably why I'm loving it so hard.
Polydunami: I loved Donkey Kong Country
art of the dress
right there
What would be fluttershy's one?
Reikim thats disgusting
00,10Corect therainbowvortex it is an OC
It's kinda orientic....nto sure it fits Rarity
Sumica: Although actually, Twilight's theme is a bit closer to modern Touhou
It's good, but for a theme song..
/me loves Uncharted 3's theme
Too Neoish?
lowfn: What?
It fits, because it's stylish
Orientic? Oriental?
Hey, since when is posting a video that was on Equestria Daily considered spoilers, and results in a 24 hour ban?
Ah, the FiM themes
Idk
was it drawn by hand or a oc maker
00,10this realy reminds me of an old super ness game
since... 72 hours ago I think?
therainbowvortex: You can't "Oc maker" sprites
00,10cant recall the name but they used it alot on Nick arcade
YES
and the one we all heard of
this one is just awesome
<3 AJ's SONG is best!
devsfar: Cause some do not want to see anything of S3 till it is officially going to air
This theme XD
Applejack! :)
Yeeeeeeeehaww!
I still like AJ's.
There's my AJ!
Since some ponies don't want to be spoiled, devsfar?
redneck
So "Farmish" <<3
dat applejack theme
:[
Banjo and electric guitar. Did not expect it to work so well.
0,14love this one too
i really like this theme
also Applejack is noob friendly
0,14the breakdown is really god
Am I right?
At first I was like da faq? But now AJ's theme is good
...
0,14*good
applejack doesn't work without her banjo
YEAH APPLEJACK, WOOOHOOO
0,14the handclap part is also great
First to guess what username I usually go by on here gets a pony!
Id give 7/10 for AJ
So yeah
meh, god is suitable
ish
Is it Devon, Devon?
lowfn: Nope.
Didn't realize banjo worked so well in a rocking beat like this? Well, you've obviously never played Blast Corps :3
00,10it's easy when I look at who has been baned for 24hours in the last day
Dun think Applejack has had her own song yet, right?
devsfar
Applejack?
Engineer is playing the banjo part
amirite Devon?
So far, PInkie at 4/10, Twi at 7/10, Rarity(Although unfiting) scores a high 7.8/10, AJ theme is around 7.1/10
We're rating this now?
Personal rating :p
I'll give you a hint: The alt of that username is the name of Twilght Sparkle's "daughter"
I like the strings
Vordox always rates
The strings part is amazing
That fiddle gets me every time.
Devon: devsfar
0,14Nyx?
and I hate when vordox rate
he rated the anthology 2 for celestia's sake
Dat offbeat clap
Pinkie - 6/10 ||| Twilight - 10/10 ||| Rarity - 9/10 ||| AJ - 7/10
SaxyPretender: You correctly guessed the alt I use when I somehow get disconnected. Now, what is the username I usually use?
Devon: devsfar
Now give me that cookie
Aaaand fade
Something about Sammy?
Mmmm yes this
not in FIM
HELL YEA
Octavia's in this? wow!
Octavias theme?
not in FIM but...
that's not official anyway
wait
Dem bombastic strings
/me suddenly thinks of the blue and white striped teaware
interesting
INb4 Octavia is added to MLPFIM
Erm
Hint: second half of it is everyone's favorite turtle-killing plumber
...
FightMagic
Sumica: playing VS's next right? ;)
Vordox, of course eventually
kingdom hearts pony!
mario_pony
Sounds alot like Rainbow Factory at the start! :o
Octavia is my 2nd favorite pony
oh wait second half
hello evry pony ohhhhh octavia
You don't think only the mane 6 will be in there right?
octavia is not confirmed to be in MLP Fighting is magic
00,10wondered how many would think she was in Mand6
Hey scottish-geeky
00,10Mane6*
Actually, Octavia is not likely to be in FightMagic
Sumica: You know, could you show a game that also is Indie vs? :D Touhou 12.3
ello scottish-geeky
And the first half is a cartoon character that always wears a hat and has the same VA as one of the Flim-Flam brothers
hia Ponies47
hey scottish-geeky!
One video only
only in their hearts
she isnt thus far
the coconut pony
If Octavia says something in the show and become canon she will become my favorite pony
this is just a battle theme
nothing in particulae
00,10I have done tohou LP's before
*particular
0,14Fighting is Magic will have 17 characters, but so far only the Mane6 have been revealed
hia MahBoi777
Mane6 claims their character list was set in stone before S1 ended, so it's pretty much impossible that OCty's going to be in.
octavia is the only pony I have I little figure of on my desk
00,10I gave up cause KB for a fighting game hurts
lowfn: According to the MLP panel and Comic Con, she'll have a duet with Rarity
Sumica: Ooh, which ones?
*at Comic Con
Reikim, do you have the list?
SaxyPretender: Steriods Pony better be unlockable XD
Sumica: Well I mean just cause it's also a indie fightng game. :)
Devon: spoiler much?
Devon, will her name be said?
at any rate it's sometimes fanon that she's Pinkiepie's sister
0,14XD
CrimsonPhoenix: No, but Octy only appeared at the end of S1. Thus, Octy cannot appear in FightMagic.
why I love string instruments?
00,10yeah, but it still hurts my arm
brb
She did appear in Season 1 though
Mutterguy: Only people who mistake her for Inkie/Binkie, whichever one is the dark gray one.
00,10I would have to find my kikijoy adaptor so I could use my ps2 controler
Sumica: A video alone. :P
Devon, there's nothing to be said about whatever is revealed at any conventions.
Oooh
Octy also appeared in Season two
CrimsonPhoenix: At the end, after Mane6 came up with their list.
Controller for PC <3
Nothing O_O
I'm not saying she's definitely in but rather that she had more chance than the rest of the cast
Sumica: why not a gamepad
So, you guys give up on getting that pony?
Devon will octavia's name be said?!
has**
00,10cause ps2 controler I have
lowfn, let it be a surprise
FRAK
Sumica: I could give ya mine ^^
CrimsonPhoenix: "The roster was been planned far before S2 started to air."
00,10besides I dont play fighteres enough to warent having one
I'll bet you guys $5 that Cadence will return, and that Twilight and Spike will sing a song together
fair nough
00,10at least not till m6
back :P
ah... haha well i bought one and havent used it XD
Reikim, when was that announcement?
You're on, Devon :3
WB Ponies47
:'(
The only fighting games I play are SSB, Soul Calibur, and FiM
CrimsonPhoenix: It's in the FAQ, under Characters, specifically asking about S2 ponies.
0,14^
SSB eh?
cause it could be after season 1 but before season 2
i lub octavia
ohohoohoho
Whos streaming?
Polydunami: Go watch the MLP panel at Comic Con, and get my $5 ready
Devon, how can you play FiM?
Your facts are loose Reikim
it's not released yet
No, I mean you're on shaky ground.
CrimsonPhoenix: Loose? I can give you a link.
OohShiny: I own a blue police box...
to completely refute Octavia
00,10sorry sneeseing fit.
hey wrek
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES

"Puttin' on the Ritz" is a popular song written and published in 1929 by Irving Berlin and introduced by Harry Richman in the musical film Puttin' on the Ritz (1930). The title derives from the slang expression "putting on the Ritz", meaning to dress very fashionably. The expression was inspired by the swanky Ritz Hotel.Can also be an adjective: "ritzy", meaning elegant, dapper; dressing well or putting on airs.
there was no color in the 30s
They see me trollin they hatin potrolling and then they catach me ridin dirty

My nostalgia sense is exploding
COPS?
Remember kids, the powers are all in the costume. Just find a good and you can start fighting crime
hehe
COPS!
yep
Ponies47: no dont saw your tail of
00,10BP Vest
Oh now I know what cops means.
Weren't all early 90s shows pretty much the same thing?
Let's go It's Crime Fighting Time
cops means cops
parkour baby
Metal gear? :P
parkour is fun
Future was a really popular fantasy in the 90s
The term COP is an acronym for "Constable on Patrol"
da faq
Destroyed City Property, legit?
Is that the Doctor Who theme in the background?
I was sheltered from the more violent cartoons when I was young. And I pretty much stuck with the PBS Kids block for way too long.
watcha gonna do watcha gonna do when they come for you
The More You Know
/me Looks at his tail "Sorry scottish-geeky" Holds out tail "I did swear it off" Tail grows back "See but it grew back" :)
OtakuTom, or Citizen.. (no, it's just not in Police Academy)
tv was full of crime and crime fighting back that. isn't it still so?
its the po po
00,10and now this
then
DAT VOICE

OH GOD
Thunder cats?

OH GOD
WHY
nooooo
...WTF?
YES
Ick.

Ponies47: your part lizerd
OOOOH MY

lol
I can't feel anything good from this
wat dis?
GO!
Oh I like this
Holy shit! ninjas!!!
dat animation
I love GO!
uhh, where was that knife?
uh Sumica....
Filler. Believe it.
Naruto counterpart of galo sengen?
scottish-geeky: Nope.avi. :P
oh gwad i wached this all the time when i was a biig naruto fan
yay
so beautiful TT_TT
ah no
Dat Hinata XD
I never was a big fan of Naruto...
its Hakuna Kanata
Admit it, who here only watched Naruto for that sexy naked chick thing he could do?
or something
like that
Polydunami, I still don't like it
I neber watched naruto
Say what you want about the actual show, but some of the thinsg naruto fans make can be pretty awesome
Do they still make episodes? I haven't seen any airings in a while.
Ok the chat keeps crashing. I'm gonna restart this computer -_-
so many better animes out there
I prefer the manga
Eddmario, I was legitimately interested in naruto at season 1
And then there's this.
well before shippuden
HARUKA KANATA!
I've got friends that like it, so I decided to check it out. It's not bad, but the extreme fanbase really turns me off from it.
Pokemon anyone?
Same here CrimsonPhoenix
I dropped the manga.
there's something like 900 episodes I think.
two series
Ponies47 look at getting your own client
YES
My favourite
this is GO!
this music is awesome
Fiiighting dreaaamers
wat
i uestd to be a big fan but it just got boring after a whiell
THis music is 10x more popular than other one
hewwo
One Piece is my favourite out of the "big three" shounen animes.
naic
The original TV series went 220 episodes, and the 2nd series is at 267.
LOL Neji XD
I prefer Bleach
OtakuTom: So I only doubled the total with my sarcastic assertion. That's... scary.
O_o
OohShiny: Bleach is ending cause it's unwanted :P
Blood+ is also good
OtakuTom: and thats why i found it boring aftter a whiel to long
shake ur booty
vordox
LAWL JIRAYA
XD
bleach continues
in manga
Kisame was always my favorite from the Akasuki
why do anime girls always have huge boobs?
ponibas: Blood+ is awesome
OohShiny: No, it's final arc
dat naruto
Combining Naruto and Shippuden, that would be 489 episodes so far.
bleach, naruto and one piece are just way too long and anime has too much crappy filler eps
story's gotta end eventually
Yeah, I liked Bleach but I got bored of it during the Deicide arc.
Vordox
I read
you know
the manga
c:
im watching the longest video everypony
scottish-geeky, fek yes it is
How many of these parodys r they?
I think I could watch the first series no problem
OohShiny: I've read manga and I've read them over 15 years now
ponibas: have you seen hell girl
OohShiny: Bleach is on it's final arc.
it is
I ship NaruHina
If I ignore Shippuden and the one after
Vordox: Bleach ended because they didn't want to make more filler while waiting for the final arc to finish in the manga. It's unknown if the anime will continue once the manga finishes.
nope
but it will last a lot
Sumica: XD
I can say Naruto is good
why the hell you so random?
because the arrancar saga lasted 5 years or so
OtakuTom: Indeed
ahaha
00,10i like random
Sumica, are you one of those slightly-chubby girls that is obsessed with anime?
This is interesting.

Sumica: Wazzat the pointz?
potato_pony: humanized loli twilight sparkle requested by my friend..

Idea for Mario Game: Mario and Bowser must team up to take bac the Koopa Kingdom, and Peach, from a possessed Luigi.
SuperBanana64: I've decided to join you in fruit hour

Here we go
ERB: Wright Brothers vs Maro Brothers
lowfn, look at the lower right corner. That desktop pony is a R63 of Sumica's OC.
[SWAG]Haku: They've done one where Maio Luigi get eaten (Yes, eaten) by bowser. then they team up and do stiff :S
Syn_Virtu Yeah, the freaking nickname change feature won't work if I put a period in the name
LAWl potato_pony Dat name :D

/me claps
Oh, sorry
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5366/
[SWAG]Haku: You kinda blew the story there. GO BUY Bowser's INSIDE story, NOW :P
lol nice high fice
/me claps
WAIT DO IT AGAIN I WASNT LOOKING!
o:
I haven't played the marimba in years :(
I KNOW THE DAMN THING
lol jk
Yes! Tesla coil music!
Hmm?
YAY
what's this?
this one is great!
OH GOD YES! These guys!
Oh boy tesla coils
Eddmario, you're thinking Mario & Luigi; Bowletta
But thats not really what Im talking about
humm
Oh god doctor who?
I know what it is already
:D
that's awesome
[SWAG]Haku: But played it? Cause...seriously...Bowser badarse, Oh then what?
this
Yep. I've seen it
is amazing
OMAHGAWD
MAGIC
music with pure energy
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
Eddmario: not that i know of
These guys are called "Arc Attack"
Im talking about a nonexistent game
negromagic
what's the music though
[SWAG]Haku: It sounds exactly like Bows'er inside story =P
oh god
It's the theme to Doctor Who
CrimsonPeach: The Doctor Who theme
YES DOCTOR WHO | OHW ROTCOD SEY
No, it doesnt
somUCH WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
oh
shocking performance!
thats not the point of my idea
I really need to watch that
HELLO! SO who be streamin?
is he a wizard?
Torchwood is an anagram of Doctor Who
[SWAG]Haku: The context that is, Luigi getting possessed, Bowser teaming up(Unknowingly), and Peach is kidnapped.
Doctor Who is pretty good.
sumi title plox
Eddmario: You don't say.jpg
:P
00,10arc attack, dr who

I love doctor as much as i love MLP
doctor who*
Anyway, Wrek has his own OC Desktop Pony, a yellow pony painting a picture of Twilight Sparkle. Phase4 has an OC, a Blue Pony launching rockets that keep exploding. And also looking at an IRC window.
MLP is the reason I got into Doctor Who
GHOSTBUSTER
who u gonna call?
<3
awesome
ghost nappa
bustghosters
Hahaha
inb4 ded guy cause of doing stupid shit :P
Kandarihu: you forgot nittanys......but either way yeahthey all got one
o.o
INB4 the electricity hits his uncovered hand
why is that guy wearing a trash can?
Heres the idea: Luigi gets possessed and takes the mushrrom kingdom from bowser, forcing the two to ACTUALLY team up, not unknowingly team up. They are then banished to some outer border of the mushroom kingdo, and must work together(The whole game is them togetehr at all times) and must take back the koopa kingdom from Luigi, who is a much more terrifying kind than Bowser ever was.
owww.. if you're gonna zoom that close. get a tripod
cratorkid: for reasons
00,10vordox, this is the one
cratorkid: For protection from the electricity
cratorkid: Eletrcity attracts to pure metals
That doesnt seem all that safe
cratorkid: to make you ask questions
Oh god, more anime

<,<
Vordox ahhh i got it, it was a poem
Vordox when I open the Gif of "Blues" I'm limited to the colors already present in the gif
Vordox when I copy my Pony into there, it changes all the colors
Lil_B: You need to upgrade the palette
Gif only handles the vertecs of what is in it
Vordox ok, how do I do that?
Creating a custom palette, to induct more colours just up the Paletta allowance
How?
As ec
Invi|Antarctica you didn't visit me? :(

Mutterguy shall I visit you? :3

:|
I casted wall of text
I gues that's the problem of having 1900 pixel screen
Vordox wait... I may have found a way around it... (why do I always find ways to to something outside of the intended way?)
Apparently I currently hold the title for Most childish decisions, Most humiliated, AND Longest link ever here on bronystate.
what do you mean TheRandomkid321
alexxm I really should try my hardest to AVOID those things :$
what sort of things
alexxm Nevermind
Lil_B: I have no trouble with it...
ok
I opened a gif, but I had full colours
Vordox mmmm... so why can't I use other colors... we have the same version I know that...
Some colors in the palette may not be used if your image does not have many colors. They will be removed from the palette if the Remove unused colors from final palette option is checked.
Vordox where is this option?
settings?
whoops, Britain uses port stanley

FairysHuff: wait... whaaa?
What? AdamTheDuck
they're body to be completely seperate from the person they are
their*

Flutterswag: um personality depends on brain structure, changes in brain can cause drastic personality changes (even split personalities and such..)
TrixieMuffins Not really. I've always felt disconnected from my body and even reality. Makes enjoying things very hard ~_~

Cool story Dash
FairysHuff: Nothing'd get done if they did. H&S don't approve of "magic" as an acceptable resonse to any question. :D
Well if I'm going to make myself go outside I suppose I should do so now before I fall asleep again ^_^
GilDash Very true ^_^

this explains the wave 4 blind bag pony design
hey guys im gonna be starting my first ever drawing for my cover for the fic My Little Pony Day Z is Magic
wish me luck and give me tips if possible
key
kay
yay zombies
:3
seriously any tips will be appriciated i have never drawn before on a computer
it would be interesting to watch your sketches :3
Are you using a mouse or a tablet, Quick_Thinker?
use gimp. and some program I forgot for vector stuff. look for pony drawing tutorials on google. there should be around 3 billions of them around
well im using my labtop to wrie
inkscape?
yes
thanks
But yea, derpy_pony is right. GIMP is a great program to use, and Inkscape is great for vectors.
and the pic is gonna take a lot of work but my god do i hope it turns out great
don't expect too much if you have no experience at all. it will take some time
i know i think it will be done next year
Yea, that's the other thing. Even if you've drawn a lot on paper, you'll have to practice again to get back into the swing of things on a computer.
i have a feeling people are reading that comment and facepalmed simoutaniously
no not really, i know a few people who constantly challenges themselves
Hey everypony
Hello Very_Silly_Filly
hey Very_Silly_Filly how've you been
well yeah challenge themselves but this is down right artistic sucide so its gonna be a bitch
Kinda pshyched actually
its gonna take at least a year to get the backgorund down
Just came back upstairs to find 20 sec left before windows update restarts my PC
If it restarted, I'da lost loads of work
no autosave?
Nope
Windows XP doesn't have that, nor does the program
well depends on the work, Microsoft word always make a save before it shuts down
Wasn't on MS word, it was on a different pogram
and I knew it wouldn't save it because it's happened before
and aren't some programming whatchamacallits automatically save too?
Playing a full screen game. and the bastard doesn't tell you it's gonna restart
lol
i'm using visual basic so that saves i think
You only have to happen to look to find OSHI, it's gonna go!
yes, I made the idle animation for my own Desktop Pony <3
I wish I could sprite :c
i could if i knew how to
but dont XD
I can draw a few things and shade them, but I can't draw much besides
should learn

Lets watch G3!
Your 10 year old relative would probably like the ponies

twi_sprinkle_GS17: Why would you hide something from it's main target audience?
-ie Pie!
wait Ponys out of scetual?

think before you laugh at the pink
Mean Pinkie is best Pinkie :P
lawl
twi_sprinkle_GS17: ok then
Helloooooo?
RobertRevenge: because kids his age are less likely to like the show because they arent adult enough to fight stereotypes

twi_sprinkle_GS17: Not entirely true. I run a boy scout troop filled with bronies from ages 11-16. o-o
I hate stairs
Awesome! I'm a scout too

I really wished they would've shown these flashbacks for everypony...
Mornin' Cypresswolf

TOM
Good morning Cypresswolf :)
Twis magic more powerful than Discords, buck yeah
Red is badass.
Ash is a wimp.

Chocobunny: Silver is even moreso.
RobertRevenge, Are you implying there are more than one generation of pokemon?
where the hell did Twi learn the memory spell?
RobertRevenge: I like Red more than Silver.
hoi Cypresswolf

Awesuumms

Chocobunny: So do I, but Silver took down Red like a baws.

Everything is Awesome in Cloudsdale

applejack tried to turn rarity gray
Jim: Yes. Yes I am. The adorableness of g5 pokemon calls to me.
I moved out of Cloudsdale becuase I was too awesome for it
laaag
that cloud hug :D
RobertRevenge: You know that Silver is the red-head in Johto, right? The one you're talking about is Gold.
Nimbus AWAY
she shouldve just ruined their ballon
5 generations of pokemon? ImGettingTooOldForThisShit.jpg

Now Rainbow Dash, where did she touch you?

RobertRevenge: And Lugia isnt?
Chaos~Friendship
Twi is godlike
sopa vs internets
magic seems to be a tad better then friendshiop
$10 on chaos. evil always wins
Mewtwo has higher stats than Lugia iirc
internets win, fatality
Twilight is OP
oni_link: g2 was when the Legendaries stopped being OP when they became part of the story. Lugia prioritizes defense and special defense over attack/special attack and speed anyways.
apple power!
Twilight is meant to be OP. Morning, all.
Laser light show rave!

Does that hold true now in G5 though? Older legendairies now are hella strong.
I find it funny that a similar thing with rainbows also destroyed the Villian in G1
and celestia did nothing. again.

Mmmmm hmmm, now where's my cake?
Hello Malavolent :)
hi Malavolent

oni_link: I don't really like taking pokemon from one game to the next, it makes it too easy to dominate everything after you trade/pal park them.

Hoenn is best region
RobertRevenge: I migrate, but I build a team using the current gen's roster or I make eggs if I really want an older gen Pokemon.
I've gone back to watch this series so many times - I focus more on whats going on in the background more often - if only to come up with more bingo options
who loves Ponies?!
Quick_Thinker: ponies? what?

I love Kanto/Johto the best.
Damn you rarity

Yes! It should be the RD Show

Lil_B perhaps farming is the earth ponies power

hi cow334
Hiya cow334
hello cow334 :)
hey cow334 how you doing
Quick_Thinker: time for an expedition!
hi cow334
hai guys how are you all
I call it germany
hi cow334 :)
hello cow334
an expedition into waht time and space?
Hey cow334
everythings perfect here
Funny how ponyville comes to alot later
We shall call it... This Land
Hello every one.....Moo
i'm good cow334 how about you
Earth, they live on it O.O
Awkward.
they really need to be more aware of their surroundings
there is a flag in pinkies hat true story
alexxm: I'm doing awesome
oni_link: Of course :D
thanks for asking
I loved the Timing in that scene
how did they not notice each other
Pinkie Pie - Time Lord
low hanging cloud
-r
okay now the question is how did they travel to find Equestria?
Weirdly, I'm OK with that
how far sorry
heh
Quick_Thinker: No idea
Quick_Thinker: Possibly very very far
Get on with it!
Bye cow334_gone
Colgate seems upset
yes, get on with it!!!!!!
so there are other places other then Equestria to our knowledge and it seems their is no oceans
get on with it
alexxm: /)
dat Rarity :D
(\ oni_link
I gotta go now guys
Take care MegaMoonShine
(\
Later :)
Quick_Thinker: Apparently
bye MegaMoonShine
Bur MegaMoonShine
Bye*
Puddinghead was clever enough to get the side with the exit :3 Clearly Puddinghead is best leader
Tom?
so that means Equestria is a just a land not the enitre planet
It's just a rock. A dumb rock.
Cypresswolf: Indeed :3
:S
puddinghead was stupid enough to invade another country <.<
Kencolt: It's Tom as a filly.
Quick_Thinker: Eeyup
and if just a land other nations have go to be out there possibly even humans
RobertRevenge: You mean colt.
RobertRevenge or his ancestor
We're Trap-ped :O
Ya Tom is all man
Quick_Thinker: Sadly we have no actual canon explanation of the origins of how the world looks
Er stallion
THEY WERE FROZEN TODAY
ded
/me bursts into flames
WINticos
windagos
/me dances around the fire chanting.
Quick_Thinker: However theres one very good fanon map that is based off known information
/me puts out fire
Haters gonna hate
funny, fluttershy was the only one to express hate/severe dislike
i daww'd
you are not even of the same color, ponies!
dat OP twilight
moral of the story: friendship is nice, but giant pillars of flame are nicer
GG NO RE
twi_sprinkle_GS17: I lol'd
and the wendigos were burned alive
fire magic ftw!
Twilight learned Firaga
and the idea of it being in a land with mountains surrounding it is a very isolated land could be greece maybe but then again they have oceans
fire is now powered by friendship
Equestria is a very dangerous place - creatures that destroy civilizations that turn to anger and hate, dragons rule the skies, timberwolves and other foul creatures rule the forests, and who knows what manner of creature lies under their hooves
this is how the friendship bunny fires started
^
Cypresswolf: ikr. but nobody ever dies
one of bvest songs time
seriously
what was the old land called?
...and then celstia came and took over.
i<3 that song
dat sync
Cypresswolf: Well said
Quick_Thinker: Old land
adasdad: indeed :D
twi_sprinkle_GS17: but then, what happened to the ponies of generations before?
good one
one of the least remixed songs
hello everypony :)
i wish they made an extended version of the song
this song is so short :(
hey somepony_else
ello somepony_else
hi somepony_else
hello somepony_else
Hi somepony_else
Quick_Thinker: Fanon made map has names of what is assumed as the different lands things originate from
hey somepony_else how've you been
hi somepony_else
hello somepony_else
waaat
Cypresswolf: they die of age, but i mean they dont die of dangers
/me hugs everypony
Eeyup
Hiya somepony_else
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
yay
Cypresswolf: there was a scene with a tomb
Wb cow334
aw
otakon17: woohoo
twi_sprinkle_GS17: Funeral
DO HO HIO
okay so the idea that this is earth and Equestria would be located in a place surrounded by mountains and no ocean in sight
YAAY
one of best eps imo
Fluttershy does mention dragons can (and more then likely do) eat ponies
in Dragonshy
...so the only reason equestria is so nice is ecause it's constantly threatened by hate-eating monsters? 0.o
Quick_Thinker: Suits surpsrisingly well for my country.
Cypresswolf: indeed
MLP could use a little more blood
there are seaponies
:D
WG, wat
adasdad: Ponies not only survive but THRIVE
norhing
just came on
:D
Well today I saw a video of my little pony season three and they where talking about crystal ponys now I need some help has any one even seen how a crystal pony looks like
WG: My little pony? THATS A KIDS SHOW, IT CANNOT HAVE BLOOD HURR DURR RAWR
come to think of it, I dont think FIM has introduced a creature from the ocean
MLP needs moar Derpy
cow334: SPOILERS!
*adds to bingo game*
well from this idea if they ever encouter an ocean at some point they would not be able to traverse it easily due to not needing boats to our knowledge at least
Lol
Needs more sea ponies
otakon17: wait what O-O
well, now i need to think of a different ep for BMN
ACS13123 : They could say it's jam. No one would suspect a thing :D
cow334: Dude, you can get banned for that
^
WG: They'd figure it out :/
whats next on the list
00,02and thats enough pony for now
otakon17: oh .... I didnt know that sorry
twi_sprinkle_GS17: This doesn't count against it.
they have airships
who is streaming?
thanks Phase4 !
cow334: Have you read the rules?
00,02yeah, no spoilers
thanks for the stream, phase4 :)
otakon17: ik, btu we just watched it
/me 00,02wants to wait for s3
okay so from the idea that it is no where near an ocean and surrounded by mountains its in a land that is fertile among other things
NO SPERLERS!
ACS13123 : Well I only saw 2 episodes anyway lol
no spelunking
otakon17: although i love that ep so i might vote for it anyway, plus i never win either way :I
otakon17: yes I have I just thought that since the episode hasnt came yet it would be okay to say it well i was wrong then sorry
Phase4, not even the koeningsegg with top gear spoiler?
ACS13123 : IT's already like a happy end
thanks for teh stream Phase4
what episode was showed?
In that video for season 3 it was all aboot [Must be 20% cooler to read rest of message]
damn, i guess i better go equip my +20% coolness item
i have to be going bye every one
cow334: Well I say it earlier, but some people don't like to be spoiled is all.
all of you all have a nice day]
bye cow334
test
www.ebay.com/sch/quills_and_sofas/m.html they are selling them for 3 months now, cow334
bye
bye cow334
and so from the idea that it is Europe is very likely they have most of the stuff that would be needed for Equestria to thrive or it could be south of Africa
I. AM. RARITY!
Bye cow334 take care
europa has no deserts
it's probably located in australia
no it dosent!
derpy when do they ever speak of a desert?
deserts
I agree with Phase4, Im one of those people that doesnt look at spoilers so that the experience is fresh and unexpected
in the buffalo war episode
hmm
australia is unlikly due to the unfertile land
not exactly the best for farming
00,02australia is unlikely due to buffalo
over a barrel
00,02we dont have those here
/me snaps his fingers and makes things burst into flames
Australia could use some bombs
Phase4: You're a aussie?
southeastern australia is fine
00,02otakon17, eyup
Neat
Midnight_Tempest is a flame alchemist :O
/me 00,02is in southeastern aus
Ohai Midnight_Tempest
rawr
Phase4 : Do you have jarate?
intelligent buffalos...maybe they stole a ship
00,02WG, nope
who is going to stream next?
Phase4: But doesn't everyone down there want you dead?
Phase4: do Kangaroos like to troll roads?
00,02otakon17, nah, just the spiders
Phase4, and the sheep.
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, no clue where that perception came from, serious or not
Lol
00,02Unnr, them too

Can´t trust the evil little bastards.

00,02but yeah
Ryunosuke those are just name drops
I've only ever seen the Rocky mountains from the east - it pretty much all plains
Phase4
00,02equestria is based of the us
pony: No worries!
:D
^^
Ryunosuke: Well it's interesting due to how the studio kinda missed a really good potential to explain origins
00,02because thats where hasbro is
Phase4 : So you bronies basically are all about love and tolerance just as in the show?
www.ebay.com/sch/quills_and_sofas/m.html this one twi_sprinkle_GS17, I linked it a few minutes ago
00,02WG
okay hold on
derpy_pony: kk thx
00,02WG, i dont hate, thats just who i am
np
as I said, there is no twilight sparkle figure for now
even though we not seen any books where twi is reading saying maps or hell boats they would kinda of be useful for traversing the planet

Ryunosuke: intersting map
hi CupcakeExtreme01
Phase4: ^, dang that was late
pony: I miss the old shows from TechTV
Phase4: But what lauren managed to make unique was you can relate to every mane six character in some way, Some side characters too
yeah that was good old days
now its all trash
also pony, if you want to ping someone you put a colon next to their name. and to autocomplete someones name, you can use the tab key.
ok ^^
well rarity i see no similarty in me as well as AJ but i can be wrong
hmm you know, odd's are bronies never saw Lauren's other shows
no i have
00,02i've seen some of them
I saw a bit.
Foster's Home count?
00,02have a much greater appreciation for powerpuff girls now
i made a pony car car on forz 4
Phase4: Pretty much, It's just very unique how it makes you able to relate in alot of ways
yes
as well as power puff girls
00,02but adventure time is not realy for me and havent seen fosters home
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: A lot of the reasons we existed in the first place was *because* we saw Lauren's pervious shows.
i loved generation 1 when i was small ^^
Phase4: you dont like Adventure Time |0 n 0|
I have seen most of laurens cartoons, Though i first realised it was her that made tem until around MLP FIM
i use to love johnny brivo
killerpony7733: Same here. Realised I liked those ones and thought, "Well, it can't be *that* bad surely." :D
Why the heck do you need to put ponies in ever single game.. I don't get it
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, not realy, it looks fun but just not my kind
Adventure Time is done by Faust?
no
I read Phase4s comment then.
*mis read
pony: me too. I miss the old cartoon network.
