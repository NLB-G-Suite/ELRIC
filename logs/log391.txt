Apparently 4 hours of sleep a night is bad for you and leads to a shorter life... But they said 4 hours is the best amount of sleep possible on QI. Goddamnit.
QI > any other source of knowledge
IMO 12 hs of sleep is best sleep
Yes.
YEAASAAAAAAAaa
BritishBrony: you rarely get more than 4 hours sleep?
Hardly. I'm always active!

Shady's back
Mr. Spin is here. You may rejoice!
/me tells everyone shadys back
hey spin
RainbowcrashNBurn: I agree entirely, who were you at the meet by the way?
I have lamps all over my bathroom :P
Awesome Mythbusters
/me Gives evrypony muffens
I used to have a lava lamp, but I didn't like it anymore
/me noms muffens
/me eats a muffin
remember to not test this while you are also in the tub as well
/me noms muffins most
/me Eats muffen
hehe
ScootaChicken: i was the one with the nike bag and the blue hooded jacket. i was also the one who went into Asdas on the way back to the station for a drink
Here derpy
hehe
My lava lamp broke, hardened into an unmeltable mass
oh yeah, I remember you
My lamp turned from purple to light orange
Umm can we look at tv now?
ScootaChicken: which one were you?
i have one of those waterproof mp3 speakers
RainbowcrashNBurn: the one with the long black hair and the guitar
was this the meet in London pub?
I wonder how many ware houses the Mythbusters had to move into during the filming of this series...
Im making bluebarry muffens
sharklion: it was a lot more informal and less structured, plus there were a lot less people
still really fun though
every single one
wuts the myth???
ah
But i need suger
my ears!
ScootaChicken: ah yes, who could forget the one who played rainbow factoryon their guitar :P
oh there we go. I thought I went deaf
oh lawl, you saw that bit of failage?
i don't know any bronies where I live :s
/me does not know what the myth is
Dropping a toaster in a bath is bad I guess
sharklion: me either
CCCP will you die if an applience falls in the bath with you
They are dropping items into water and seeing if you die
Does anypony have suger?
yes
fillyfillyy: oh

Bathtub... toilet...
And how much voltage it produces
I think my new phone is worse at 3G stability than my last one.
icing, caster, granulated, brown or muscovado?
Dont you there
I didn't know that was a myth
/me gives pinkieruler124 sugar and arsenic
That seems like a reasonable thing to avoid
Just normal suger
fail
You realize they usually take the original myth and say "lets go ALL THE WAY!"
all this electrocution talk made me think...what happens if Wolverine gets electrocuted like this
Scary sign of times when a 3-year-old phone has better reception than a state-of-the-art smartphone
hehe
Jim: but then how can i text in the shower?
/me Makes bluebarry muffens
don't worry wolverine is always grounded
Done!

This is fun to watch the fail, actually
We already the .movs and that the cupcakes PMVs but man, if those were just violent, not perfect. Man, I sure hope trolls don't make bunches of r34 themed PMVs. That would ruin the fandom forever.

1st season of MLP
1080p rips
and suddenly the chat feel dead.
1080 upconverted iTunes rips?
looks like pony_915 finally got the right idea.
I just find the troll boring. Whatever happened to decent trolling? It's become a lost art.
BLAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
nnope
13never really was an art
What u use to torrent?
13more like
Trolling is an art
CK|Asleep: it is still performed today by RAWRity and Meanwhile
13throwing paint at a canvas and pretending it's art
13except it's not paint
13and it's not a canvas
I gave the troll an idea, and went away to get started on it.
old fassioned trolling was at least amusing
plutonic dry humping = trolling.
oh bollocks, pony_915 is back.
here we go...
Tommorrow is National Pancake Day everypony
Hi, i wanted to know if I can watch the episode on saturday, and at what time

1pm eastern is what mountain
I'm quite happy they pushed it to 12:00CST. I need the sleep.
something tells me half the trolls dont know the literal definition of trolling
Shizuka: If I had to stomach the notion that dolphin sounds are considered "music" in my Music Appreciation class, then I'm obligated to accept splatter on a canvas as art too.
:p
I haven't seen him in quite awhile
/me hugz and nomz otakon, ScootaChicken, Jim, and Everlasting_Joy

My brother and I have agreed that I should pay my own bills, instead of her taking my money and deciding what to pay for
/me licks Everlasting_Joy

I think the Hub did it because Cartoon Network is doing it DC nation thingy.
/me hugz and nomz Vinyl

CCCP: what you did?
^-^ Great to see you too Ish[RndmPronoun]Pony

She hated it. I knew it when she said "Fine. Go down there and split it up, but you don't have any credit. I have good credit. They will charge you $100 for Internet"
13everyone should know their UTC offset, makes calculating time so much easier

Everything is random.
Indeed
6_9derp derp derpy6_9<3<3i love derpy i can fuck her so bad
I agree with Shizuka
Ever see Marie from Everybody Loves Raymond? Telling my mom that I would prefer doing it myself is like admitting I hate her

I'm a pro
I'm not even playing The Game, so sorry PinkiePieCopy. I did not lose it.
WE CAN SAVE DERPY!!!!!
Everybody is playing it
You cannot not play it
I am however playing "The Other Game" which you always win at, when you think of it.
can we add a rule :If a mod loses the the game, those that are responsible gets a kick?
Derpy is not dead
yep Val. I like that vid.
she will never die
00,03Anyine see that one video with Derpy saying sad stuff?
ever
PinkiePieCopy just like anonymous
Flim and Fla- I mean CCCP, tell us how to save Derpy?
00,03anyone*
yeah scoot
you cannot join anonymou
ohhhh yeah
you are a member of anonymous
00,03I... cried a little..

00,03just a tear..
but there is no group of anonymous. yet we are many. and we are one.
wait a minute, that grey pony isn't derpy
in the mcdonalds set
link ?
People say its Lily Blossom
We need Machete. It was Machete who saved Speedy Gonzales. He can save Derpy.
Tom, see above
Herostar why not
umm
00,03crud, brb!
TrixieMuffin
tab failed
Scoot-Scootaloo: i couldnt bring myself to finish watching, it made me sadder than reading my little dashie
Tovler: there must be a way. First of all we could explain to Hasbro that derpy hooves is not mentally disabled. And even if she was should they censor a Mentally disabled person? Patrick from sponge bob is meantally retarded but hes not sensored.
Fluttershy expresses herself in one word: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXgFZgnivXs
hmm well then
Us fans love derpy hooves and it really hurts us too her be changed
I thought partick was just a starfish- he has no brain
i completely agree with you there CCCP
I'm not that deep. I see that they DID do the whole derpy thing. I see they ARE making changes. I see the community making AWESOME videos (like the sad derpy). I don't care what happens honestly. The memories are still there.
Mutterguy: okay then what about the other stupid pony in the episode with Trixie? He was clearly retared
Or tell Hasbro that is was an accident that all of Derpy's prior appearances were of her wrecking stuff. The Derpy character deserves a second chance.
My mind will just reject the changes made and accept that derpy will always be derpy. I don't see her gone
flutter_spin: so u wouldn't even be slightly happy if u saw derpy hooves changed back?
guys i'm thinking about going to McDonalds and ordering a happy meal just to get 1 of each pony they offer :L
Well I'm weird that way. Right now I can't even accept that derpy has been changed. Right now I still see her as I saw her in the original episode.
ohh McD has MLP toys right now?
March 5th
Ye
flutter_spin: i get what u mean.
yo everypony
I leave for a bit and get pingd
Gunthler: just buy the toy instead of the meal
'The Beatles were Communist'
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6RbEOlqRo&list=PL1B3AC58298EC17A0&feature=mh_lolz
aww i have to wait til march 5th
holla holla get $
dat Moonbase Alpha
whats march 5th
Derpy right now has no established meaning and Hasbro is primed to own that word.

alright be gone a bit drama at home

Hello?
hi

hi MadxHatter123
Yo.
Anyone know where I can find the newest episode online? I missed the live stream saturday because I had a drivers-ed class that day.
there was no new episode this week
do they just give you anyold one or do you have to ask specifically for a certain set casue i know they usually have a set of boys toys and girls toys and sadly i think thisll be classified as a girls toy
MadxHatter123: on youtube
No new episodes. The show has been put on hiatus due to the derpy incident.
wait really?
no
I don't believe that
new ep next week

how big of a weirdo am i gonna look like walking into McDonalds and asking for 1 of each of the MLP toys >_>
Not at all
all the bronies will cheer
Someone suggested using the drive-thru
Just answer them with "I'm A BRONY!"
But I'm totally going in and asking for girls toy
I'M A BRONY AND I'M PROUD
Finding the blind bags at Toys R Us was so totally worth the courage
If you have a straw hat with silly buttons on them, people will just think you're an eccentric toy guy.
all you have to say is...."I'm a Brony got a problem with that
^
ugh
its going to kill me! Why does that video sound so familiar
flutter_spin: which one?
Kinda sounds like Mordecai from Regular Show
oh dont get me started on mordacai
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkWCg3f0KWo that one
Thats borderlands talk?
all i got to say is......http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5dgyCryWJY
the chorus is from good ol' days
http://i.imgur.com/L2Jg1.jpg
i just read my little dashie for the first time
lol nice picture
well....good ol' days used the chorus from that
I'm gonna go. I want to get some xbox time in. See ya.
:P
lol yeah
xbox is awesome playing right now :)
I don't know. the 20% remix just didn't hit me right.
i should jump on too
maybe
i'm playing some cod
xboxis awsome but PS3 is better
meh
all the good CoD players use Xbox
;P
:p
Im come back to talk off cod???
yay
/me leaves again
good cod players? haha
lol
rosey have you ever played the pc version?
bonjour
:D
console players got nothing on pc players
no
oh cool
hola RAWRity ~
D:
and yes i have both
i have troubles aiming with mice
nopicture for that
PC gamers <3

how goes things, everypony?
:l
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw0yqTqHXT0 = PC Gamers
I played Mass Effect on the xbox and Mass Effect 2 on the PC. I have no problem with mixing the two.
i play with my xbox controller on my pc
no shame
:)
not sure how you could have trouble aiming with a precision instrument
:(
Snuffsis WHHHYYYYYYYYYYYY ;A;
mehh~ don't know if i'm sick or just tired ~
:0
don't make me pull out fearcrads now
:S
"That was an improvement, but it's not hard to improve on garbage, try again" always make me laugh
Noooooo, where is my backup DAW pic?
:L
same thing unfoundbug yet i'm trying to get better with the mouse ~
:C
i find the controller more natural for shooters
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3055/
D;
dat link
damn
plus also, its infinately more fun to taunt the people you beat by informing them that your using a controller
:P
wow
Silver_Steak, beware of such links :o
unfoundbug: thats because you started with consoles, and pc guys like the mouse because the same thing ~
why?
:O
We don't talk about... you know what video here
TheGreatAndPowerfulT actually i started on the pc
hah
Thats from a vid/vids that arent allowed in this chat :D
xbox controllers are best for shooters to me
which video?
then i don't know ~
PC guys like the mouse because of the infinitely better precision.
and i usually spend more time on the pc than my xbox
hi pony_8942
shed.mov?
:D
hi
Yep
Silver_Streak: NO
Cant talk/show.or link that in this chat :o
:O
its not actually that much better though, the increased precision is offset by actually having to MOVE the damn thing
I like parts of it. but ok
^
pc guys always rage on me because i'm a battle medic, dead ringer spy and i'm using a xbox controller ~
Meh, the mods dont like it :P
:P
It's not offset or anything, it's ALOT better, doesn't matter if you have to move it or not.
you wanna quickly do a 360, your stuck with your mouse on the other end of your desk
And theyre always lurking >.>
:O
wow
TheGreatAndPowerfulT people rage cause your an annoyingly good spy
The only good a controller is for, is for comfort. :P
:P
nah ~ i'm not that good ~
Yeah :D
:D
Adjusting mouse speed can help achieve 360 spin. No point in having an argument over this. Pc Gamers love their mouse and console players love their controllers. If someone rages, it's just because they're soar losers

It is a certain amount of currency relevant to your geographical location.

hihi
hai fluttercry ~
hello

:O
lyra time?
oh, story updates
They keep making Pokemon.. I remember the 150 T-T
31 ponies and counting :)
dat EQD spam!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEnWvHrfgYE
05,15I never really liked pokemon that much. It was alright but I never got obsessed *hides behind flame shield
um, Silver/Gold was on the Gameboy Color. If you're talking about Heartgold/Soulsilver, those were on the DS.
Prince Dari seems to be a bot
Actually, 28 ponies, 1 griffon, 1 buffalo, & 1 Discord to be exact
ugh what the
hell
Cypresswolf, youre so lucky you can afford such things....
steal ponies
The gameboy color was compatible with the gameboy advance as well..
I didnt buy them all at once. Been collecting since early July
Yes it was for the gameboy color.. but it also worked on the advance. not the Ds
not all them are custom
well time for me to trek on down to McDonald's :)
Well, i have no source of income :'( I can get anything....
Have fun RoseyPony!
RoseyPony: get me something too pweese?
k, back.

The games made for gameboy could fit the slot in the back.
several are blindbags I got from hasbro box and toys are us or walmart
Wb Tovler :P
05,15Wait...are the pony toys at McDonalds now?
heh how much are the toys
brb
is anything playing
I would want to hang out with Dashie :L
The blind bags are like $3-$4 right?
(dammit. I was wait for the Premium Grey version to come out instead of the incomplete B/W version.)
or is my comp just not wanting to show anything
fluttercry: they start next week I believe.
no stream
what exactly is a blind bag
05,15Damn, I don't have class tomorrow and I was going to hit up every McDonalds in town
RaveBrony: 2$ at walmarts, 3$+shipping on Toywiz
kenne88 - individually packaged pony figures
but they aren't labeled except for a small number
kenne88: it's an opaque bag with 1 MLP figurine.
Its a mystery bag with a pony figure inside :P
e
oh ok
e_e
RAWRity, wait... Walmart in the US???
o.o
is it determined or completely random?
unless you know what those numbers relate to, you don't know what each bag contains
*Walmart, as in
RaveBrony: yes. They've slowly been working their way into walmarts over the past couple months.
Holy hell!!
I'm so gonna go to MC donalds and Demand a kids meal..
...
Guess who is going to Walmart tomorrow? :$
hmm before i go hhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PjIhs72l0Aeres a trip to the rainbow factory.......
grr
05,15Everyone at my McDonalds is Russian. Random fact
silly touchpad
your local one may or may not have them (mine haven't) but I've been hearing from other places that they're showing up.
I cant believe im saying this, but I totally want a happy meal right now :D
:O!
I wonder how creepy it would be to dawn a baggy black hoodie and pants and grab a shitload of MLP blindbags at walmart
CupcakeWarrior: who DOESN'T want a happy meal?
4 inch ponies are $5, blind bag box was $56 with tax. no telling how much I spent on customs alone. all but 10 on the shelf are customs, the other store bought ponies are stock piled everywhere else: closet, under the bed, in the corners of thr room...
well i'm off for some toys peace
Photon-Phoenix: I plan on doing just that when they finally get here.
"Yes I would like a plain cheese burger with Fries... and errm, a kids meal NAOW!
well at least I know they hve a Chance at being there, RAWRity, ty! :$
toys come with happy meals too right?
kenne88: eeyup, that's what makes them happy ;)
:L
05,15I'm going to order the happy meal like a boss. no ordering two meals for me!
I would probably buy another meal, so that the cashier thinks I am ordering for more
than one person
05,15Hell no! Wear your colors CupcakeWarrior

Derpy Hooves, my first custom was, about $160. I havent seen or heard from the artist since
Fine.
Get multiple happy meals! More ponie >)
If I can walk straight down the aisle at wal-mart once a week and look for MLP blind bags, you can order some greasy food and say you want the girl's toy.
Hi , 1 happy meal please , ... no the other toy .... no .... just give me the fricken pony already
TrixieMuffin - i think they're used to it by now
Ive only seen the blind bags at Toys R Us
Ive never seen any blind bags
I'm about to go to McDonald's and just ask for 1 of each of everypony :L
Cypresswolf: they're been slowly coming into wal-marts around the US.
I walked down the aisle in Target looking for blind bags and a couple of people gave me "Wtf" looks :D
and i didnt mind one bit :$
Gunthler: I think you can actually do that :o
xD
By the way, what is the best store for ponies?
05,15Are you sure, don't they usually only have one toy at a time?
whats best store for ponies
two ~
Stores in europe :D
Toys R Us
^ yep yep
Like, I'm fairly certain McDonalds DO sell their toys in bulk. IIRC, that's how I got all their Beanie Baby toys years back.
Oh yeah :o
I have no good stores in my town except Wal Mart
Hi everypony.
Hi
What's new?
HIIII
Hi everypony
Hello Zappy!
:) I have no problem asking for ponies at McDonalds. When the neopets toys invaded a few years back 2005 or 6, I bought every one I could ( I was working night shift at Walmart - Grocery Stocker) I'd buy them on my way out when MD's opened in the morning
no stream today :(
Last time I went to toys r us, all I found was Pinkie and that RD toy with the huge butterfly winfs
Hi CrazyBronyDonut.
wings*
I did it for the codes :)
man alls i got was a star wars top thingy
I got a rock
05,15hey...Star Wars is legit
05,15at least...the original unedited ones
What?!
Oh i buy toys like a fiend i go to target, toys-r-us and walmart and just have pink boxes stacked up and a huge grin on my face at the cashier
:)
lol
HEy, Anypony Play Spore? Its kindof an old game by now, but I suddently have a really bug urge to play that agian
I do
NOPE.jpg

i once did Cypresswolf
Me too. I don't play as much though.
Anyone play Croc?
or Crash Bandikoot :P
i remember the old crash bandicoots
watz dat?
they were fun
You are a thing that tries to kill an alien
Is the whole premise of the game
Croc? I played Croc and Crash bandicoot when I was little. Fun times...
I havent played in years :) I think I was trading with just about every planet in 1 arm of the galaxy when I got bored with it
I cheated and went to the middle because the bad guys were OP
Planet full of Ponies!
that sounds like a nice place to be
I'mma make a pony on spore
I never did find Earth in the game
05,15Has anyone heard of The Last of Us?
neigh
nope?
yep
i think so
anyone played Warcraft or Diablo?
WoW
05,15It's made by the same people that made Uncharted, so I'm super excited
Ive played Diablo 2
i dont mean WoW
i think i didnt really follow when i saw it was ps3 exclusive
once played WC2 and 3 all the time
i mean like the strategy type Warcraft
Warcraft 3. I played that game before.
WC3 rocked
I'm excited for Borderlands 2 and Guild Wars 2
Warcraft was a strategy game?
IKR?
WC3 was amazing
uncharted was overrated
omg
05,15LIES

WC3 was the reason for WoW it had so much lore
EveningDken2012
uncharted overrated? you don't say?

Undercover Brother has a 25 mil budget which for some fucked up reason is considered high budget here.
25m is high budget
but did it do well in box office
-_-
?
Tbh I have no idea what's classed as high or low in terms of movie budget.
I go by direction.
38 million, Undercover Brother did modestly well.
/me is wooliest sheep.
I go by if it did well in box office
/me nuzzles the Meanwhile sheep <3
Tropic Thunder has a 90 million dollar budget. THAT is high budget

Transformers 2 was shit
Sheepony is now a thing.

It's MEGA SUPER POO
Nittany_Discord: that movie is pretty good
it was the shit of worms
^
it was the shit of MICRO BACTERIUM
Meh...I find the g1 transformers more enjoyable
^
otakon: Transformers 3 was worse than shit
Twilight had a budget, THAT is way higher budget that it deserved
It's a great movie for people that love ROBOTS AND ACTION!
^ he
heh*
CupcakeWarrior: not possible
im okay with tropic thunder. Jack black all the way
Transformers 2 was just shit compared to 3
Tropic Thunder was HILARIOUS
I can't really remember Tropic Thunder.
Well later guys ~ going to get a shower or Sleep or something~ See ya ~
I think my brain gave out on me halfway through.
Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
Transformers 3 was vexing, which is better than a nightmare (2)

The Avengers has a budget of around 170~200 million, that is high budget and that movie is going to rock the world
It had better.
Well, I just heard the most amazing speech ever made
Snuffsis: I hope it does...
Or I will be one upset sheep.

So, during his bit at the Oscars, Robert Downey Jr. essentially turned it into a scene out of Iron Man 3
Twilight's entire box office (all 4 films) : $2,505,607,804 :O
Whut
so... are we going to watch a movie or what
CupcakeWarrior: all the bits in the world couldn't make those atrocities worth anyones time.
That's BILLION guys
/me pounces otakon and Meanwhile
/me weeps
05,15Inbetweeners Y U DISTRACT ME FROM HOMEWORK
And...I gave my money to see the first Twilight movie.
CupcakeWarrior: nobody ever accused the Twilight films of not being profitable.
/me is not affected
/me blew chunks when Twilight 4 had a 130 mil opening weekend.

Nope

Look at the sheep and feel better. http://derpy.me/btUcx

Too bad it sucked.

Daytona 500, one of the commentators says something about the temperature being "20 degrees cooler"
/me baas.
Dashie_Dashie: then the power went out
I only got the 720p iTunes rips
overrated is avatar
Blech
dude theres 4 shirts i want on the We Love Fine Site :L
but really, in the world of modern blockbusters, 2.5 Billion isn't that much.
Anyway, I have never seen Avatar
CupcakeWarrior: that looks highly inconvinient.
I'm skeptical
I saw Avatar on a plane. Repeatedly. For 9 hours.
/me demands that the mods not consider 25 million high budget.
Meanwhile: Apparently it died in July :(
i'm an artist
that is one ungroomed sheep
Oh no
that is A DAMN CUTE SHEEP
:3 Maaaaah
MEANWHILE ON THE SCREEN ON THE LEFT!
/me baas.
WHAT'S ON THE SCREEN TO THE LEFT
One does not simply shear wool.
/me shears Meanwhile
Really? My stream is acting up again
F5, coming up
there's nothing on the stream
/me is now a cold sheep.
Jack and Jill had a 80 million dollar budget. … what?
Nope, there's nothing
*puts a blanket over sheep Meanwhile*
but it did awful in box office so it was their own fault
You're s-s-s-s-sposed to s-s-s-shear in the summer!
HOW DARE YOU TRICK ME TO REFRESHING THE PAGE
Tovler: Well, like half of that was probably towards Adam Sandler's cocaine pile.
You know what we should watch? IRON SKY!
streams fine for me
um
/me huddles under the blanket.
POOR FUZZY SHEEP!!!
Snuffsis: never heard of it
Snuffsis: !
OOH!!

Wait, there really IS a stream?
YOu know what we should watch? The Artist!

Otakon: How have you never heard of Iron Sky? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_IndUbcxc
otakon: Nazis on the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOON-Ah!
enope
oh
RAWRity: I've heard such positive things about it.
It's a finnish indie movie, budget of like 70 million.
/me baas.
Pirates of the Carribean 4' budget was 300 million
no wait, jack and jill made almost as much as it's budget, so, technically, it did ok
We are watching buffering again?
Nazi's on the moon with Woona?
I meant to see Attack The Block but I never did -_^

Dken2021: no, it didn't. To be considered commercially succesful, a film has to gross Twice its budget, roughly.
Hmm,

Oh my

There's the Promotional costs, too.
The new Rob sitcom gets a 1/10 I've never such a racist show.

Tovler: using my calculations you are older than 14

Dark__Horst: he says that it is offensive
On the mlp steam group someone said they watched the episode on demand and Derpy was fine (as in it was the old episode)
ima kitteh
05,15that's cool. I didn't need sleep tonight
11,01Don't bash on them.
HIS ASS is offensive
How do I convert .MKV files after downloading the torrent?
11,01It's their opinion.
11,01Just not the majority.
CCCP: I never knew people actually thought that. I assumed it was trolls.
wasn't there a school shooting in texas maybe you could write about violence fluttercry?
:o
pet me ima kitteh
Nittany_Discord: Their opinion is wrong.
CCCP: Remmber, Love and Tolerate

/me pets Eulshy :)
MY EYES! THEY BURN!
*purr*
CupcakeWarrior: i try my best
im going to try to stay up as late as last night but go to school this time lol
05the people who think it should be censored, are the ones with the problem of being offensive in the first place
virginia virgin-ia virgin
/me accidently visits a tumblr with pony porn...
00,03Are you kidding me? Virginia is full of stuff that happens!
i honestly think the derpy issue is getting out of hand i had to put a stop to about 15 derpy related arguments in the 20percentcooler comments
:D
nothing ever ever ever happens in Mass
yeah...
11,01PinkieSpice: That feeling *shudder
00,03Like snow storms and stuff

00,03Also Virgina=Virgin=Virgin Mary
Now if Derpy was a MALE pony...
05,15See, we just do dumb stuff here
I mean BOY pony
:O
If i want something to be censored, i want to hear it coming from people that are offended by it, not someone else. :P
/me deflects Vagineer's fist with his moustache.
00,03Which equals Religion talk in our schools!
I got kicked for bumtaze...?
What the heck
Such as Snails, nobody wants him censored
Derpy should have been voiced by Roz Ryan
o.o
11,01Virginia: the only state where cities are counted as counties.
Religion = fails
Does anypony why I was kicked for BUMTAZE
11,01No.
Eulshy knows.
Blah blah blah
11,01Do I fail?
what's a county?
Derpy = Epic Brony Happiness.....thats why people wanted her gone :'(
Vagineer, i'm guessing because of all caps?
05,15inb4 religious war
^
11,01No religious war.
Inb4 no controversial topics
religion does not equal fail its people who try to push their religion on other people who fail
Not in MY BronyState
no one cares
00,03So how about dem mudkipz?
no seriously, what's a coutny?
who here plays dead rising 2 every now and then?
/me snickers
11,01Yes.
/me pins Scoot-Scootaloo
Same here
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/542/
Hurr
Im atheist so I wouldnt give a crap if there was a religion war
Mudkipz? In my bronystate? It's more likely than you think
We are dumbass children. We cannot have adult conversations here.
What CupcakeWarrior said.

00,03AGHH Get it off me D:

Mud. Kip.
11,01Some atheists get ruffled over religion.
HAMaLUH!
Dashie_Dashie: get VLC
Somehow...
11,01It's almost like a religion to some.
Some religious people get ruffled over atheists.
whyd you get mkv files and not avi?
Dashie_Dashie, where you get dees torrents?
/me shrugpony.
11,01Except you have to /not/ believe in God.
Nittany_Discord: the religion of telling other people their religion is dumb
yeah but I hear VLC is laggy.
Nittany_Discord: i read that people who believe in something live longer
05,15and then there's agnostics. where we just...don't care
lol atheism being a religion is like ironic er sumthing
Since when the hell did you have a kick for bumtaze?
Ravebrony I got them from torrentz
CandyBar!
/me stretches.
Ah, okey dokey lokey
Vagineer: I think it's the spam you're doing
Nittany_Discord: like the Amazing Athiest?
/me rolls fluffily over LadyCanary.
05dont make me taze you again vag
It's not spam it's caps
.3.
05,15don't taze me bro
all that hamula and that jazz
Atheism is anti theism, so ofcourse they present arguments against religion, and thus it seems like a religion.
00,03Bro Don't taze me D:
Condeh Baar!!
ima go get ice cream, everypony should get some as well
correction it's the royal canterlock voice
*tazed*

Religion's fine. Just don't make laws that are only justified by religion.
Also, best part of needing new clothes for everything? No-hassle packing, if I forget something it just means I'm finally forced to go shopping
Don tase me Brony
most atheists are agnostic atheists though.

Heeheee :3 :3 silly CandyBar
Seriously, screw humanity.

00,03That chef cost me my sanity...
05i wub u
The bill that would have banned birth control in Virgina has been shelved like SOPA.
O.o
Alas Snuffsis human beings are horrible things.
The trouble is, people are arrogant greedy bastards
05,15Utopia would be boring, because if everything was perfect, we'd have nothing to compare it too
would crap bricks if wrek had all that remains somewhere in setlist
I know, I'm one of them
05,15therefore, it wouldn't be special
00,03No I prefer communist guns, so I can feed them to Friendship Prime!

Oh my

CandyBar: what's wrong with octavia?
I don't pay for my entertainmen.
Pirating is illegal guys
Everytime you pirate a Pony episode, Derpy hooves sheds a tear behind her bars in Hasbro Prison
to hell with that.
RaveBrony - that's no reason to not buy the other episodes
your gripe is with The Last Roundup - specifically DON'T purchase that episode
I know :P
i don't do torrents
how much does it cost per ep
It's piracy if you redistribute, right?
it's 3$ an episode
Once I get a job ill be sure to actually buy them, just for support :D
Just download the eps from youtube
*picks up the Black phone* GET ME UNDERCOVER BROTHER!
over 90000 dollars
just watch it free on youtube
05its illegal to upload
I don't mind pirating for "legitamite reasons" but I don't mind paying
3$ an episode on Itunes or 30$ for one season
yeah screw that youtube sounds like a better deal
Damnit! firewall here blocks irc
torrents ar elike holding up a huge sign with your ip adress for every sniffer to see
CupcakeWarrior - it's less about having them and more about actually supporting Hasbro
05not illegal to download
05AND
Just download youtube downloader and download the EPS
$3/episode
05its only illegal to download torrents that contaion ILLEGAL MATERIAL
Here in sweden, it's legal if you share your moves and music with friends, so if we all just become great friends, we're safe.
/me lives in Canada
05it is not illegal to download TORRENTS
sup Zealot?
Lol^&
/me G'day mate
technically thats true
yeah, but these EPs are being sold
Hey RoflBot
downloading them free has to set SOMEONE off
Everytime you PURCHASE a my little pony episode, Derpy Hooves gets 5 minutes of Sunshine :p
like if you really can't find something at all or there are no copies left, then it's ok with me
is it just me or is stream frozen
nm
what ?
you?
Is the season 1 dvd already out
05besides
/me sneezes
05once the S2 DVD with english is released here in sweden im getting it
Blees you, Jim :$
dken2021: Like NES or SNES games and such. :P
did i miss something on the stream?
indeed
if 10,000 people buy both season 1 and 2, Derpy hooves will get to leave Hasbro Prison!
Thank you ^_^
Wait
Hmm. I could've sworn I was wearing clothes a second ago...
PinkiePieCopy:
Woot
Is emulation illegal?
:o
depends
Emulation is ILLEGAL
Good night
Personally, i don't even like buying old games redistributed onto steam and such. because the developers of those games don't get any money from those sales. :(
Goodnight Bronystate, see you guys tomorrow
if you're VIEWING IT/ PLAYING IT for free it's ILLEGAL
...wow, Daytona 500 just got interesting...
pricing for imports are ridiculous
a car just slammed into one of the jet driers
Virtual Console is legal
Japanda: depends on where you live, if you own the game generaly its legal
Stop trying to get COMPLICATED with it. PIRACY is Piracy
mfw Ive broken the law a bunch
Playing what for free
Correction!! Only illegal....if you get caught ;)
ugh. The Brony Show is boring
jet driers as it an airplane jet engine
Mfw I don't give two shits about government law. :)
sleep well
Emulation is only illegal if you don't own the game yourself. :P
Phase4: That's different, you own the game
!cd
Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 4 days, 15 hours, 7 minutes, 7 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
Brb
4 DAYS WHAT THE HECK
05oh hey
4 days
Japanda: yeah, but waht about games that you can't get any other way?
I'm going to youtube, SCREW THAT
It went from
6 days
to FOUR DAYS?
00,03dat time traveling
otakon: Wait for Public Domain
11,014 days is better than 10.
05i own this copy of warcraft 2, but the CD is old and scratched, I'll download the torrent to play it. tell me Japanda, is that illegal?
Japanda: sure, but you said that emulation was illegal. its not on its own
I hope someone leaks the next episode
somepony invent a time machine quick!!!!!!!!!!!
Japanda: on Dragon Warrior for the GBC?
... Nah.
Phase4: I said it was illegal if you got it for free.
otakon: when it comes to oldergames it's okay, since, ibelieve that copyright laws on IPs only last up for 10 years or something like that.
There is something called Abandonware , some old stuff that you can download free because the publisher or whatever no longer wants to support it or something like that.
technically, it would be illegal
very so
public domain for earthbound? fat chance
So...
Japanda: ah, must have misread or missed that.
it's illegal getting cracked terraria?
No worries mate PHASE4
For free
Good grief what've I returned to?
/me waits for iTunes to accidentally upload Putting Your Hoof Down.
Indeed
^
Shit
Or rather, after a certain amount of time they have to renew the copyright to maintain it.
Actually, it could happen
05to me, if i have payed for a copy of sometihng, im entitled to download it, morally that is
I got cracked terraria that never works
/me waits for itunes to screw up as well
otakon: you can get dragon warrior on GBC for 250$
11,01Piracy is piracy, but companies that buy up and sit on IPs are another thing.
lol, like the Hobbit?
11,01And abuse their copyrights.
however, selling used games to someone or giving them away for free will never be illegal, no matter what the faggy, user-raping companies will say
11,01And breach fair use.
Japanda: yeah, right.
tHE hOBBIT is not Publi DOMAIN
Not paying for things>paying for things
what i miss?
well they DID have to wait until the Hobbit contract ran out
Absolutely nothing
11,01Hoping that the other side doesn't want to go through the trouble of proving fair use.
ok
11,01Because of one-sided copyright laws.
00,03Is Animal Farm public domain? I know its funded by the CIA
What CandyBar said. I also download stuff i've pre-ordered because fuck me having to wait 2 weeks for a game to come out here in Sweden when it's out in the US and the internet already.
Sounds yummy Meanwhile
05,15What...the...hell is this weird alien in a business suit...
Flutter_shy: Peter Jackson owns the license to the Lord of the Rings franchise
The Count of Monte Cristo is public domain
flutter_spin: peter Jackson
/me waits with Dken2021 and Tovler
fluttercry: you're watching the one with the soaceman in the lake aren'tcha.
Can we talk about ponies now?
05,15yup
spaceman*
Polydunami: The count of Monte Cristo is Public domain because it was writte by shakespeare LOL
Umm
CupcakeWarrior: are Brittish ponies fine with you? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOi3StWmG7A
You'll have to keep watching the series to actually understand what's happening.
Ever heard of Dumas?
here's my 2 cents: I say it's ok if it's because you can't afford ridiculous import prices or they just don't make them anymore, but for things like minecraft or games that are like only $15-20? wrong
05,15Awesome. So far this is turning out better than I expected
lolwut
sudden quits
btw, is there any schedule to the streaming of the series we started watching here?
Polydunami: Sorry, Dunami
hi LC
11,01I heard that companies are/were trying to get things pulled from public domain.
Everything should be free :P
bye lc?
0,5No im here
No no, it's fine
ohai LC
I've made incorrect assumptions myself
Allo LC.
I SAY!
all these join/parts are confusing me
lali-ho lord of bacon

Hello there LordCelestia
hi LC!
flutter_spin: Let's say you make a movie and you're a poor director. You shouldn't get a cent for your movie?
bravo
Companies are doing all kind of things to limit the publics access to things. Corporate censorship and all that.
The fact that I would have never bought it with my money is justification for piracy. *pirates Twilight*
hello LordCelestia
Speakng of free/ download stuff, is there a graphic EQ i can download for win7?
:D
the only ones that get hurt by pirqacy are the ones that fail at what they produce
Right now I'm fighting Mom for the right to pay my own bills.
/me flies over to LordCelestia and nestles in his mane, waiting for a somepony
Why would you want to pay your own bills?
Tovler: I would never buy a Ferrari with my money, does that mean I should break into a dealership and steal one?
05break it up you two
Woah
The only things I have that've been pirated are stuff other people gave me.
I'd be thrilled if someone else paid my rent
mmmmmm bacon.....
/me lifts LadyCanary to the corner and pats her on the head, behave now
http://equestria.fadri.org/034-offensive/
11,01Companies also want to limit public access so they can profit off of it.
bacon?
Japanda: No, but you could download it if it was possible? :P
bacon
Ive got to get some sleep everypony!! As always, take care and have fun!! Good night! :$
CandyBar: W-what did I do? I always go to LC's mane.
Snuffsis: You can't download cars silly.
11,01Not just profit off of what normally could be.
companies are greedy hives
05you see
night RaveBrony
You wouldn't download a car
If by stealing, you mean "cloning" the ferrari, then yes.
05ITS MINE
05MIIIIINE
05HAHAHA
we shouldn't be surprised by their crap anymor
night RaveBrony
Bluestrom_S: i lol'd
Dat loony laugh.
We, right now, are talking about the reasons SOPA and PIPA exist
Japanda: don't be so sure of that! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX-iJLHZt8M
11,01Companies are greedy be definition.
/me waves 'bye' to everypony!
11,01They're not all bad.
bye RaveBrony
You wouldn't download a car...
meant the fact that companies want more money
11,01They have to make money, and they use it to make things better.
tell that to EA and Ubisoft
Buck you I would so download a car.
i want to download a car
Can't Sleep~ Hi again everyone ~
11,01Well, I'm not defending EA and Ubisoft.
Meanwhile YES"
Wb TheGreatAndPowerfulT
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Snuffsis: That is going to take a couple decades to develop fully. Right now, all it is good for is 3-D Hentai.
11,01Those companies want to rule everything you buy.
Nittany_Discord: The best stuff comes from the public though, the community surround everything.
hello TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Also, I tend not to steal from small companies. Ferrari is probably a small company despite its rich clientele.
dat Midna pony
yay snuffsis
/me hugs everyone~
05I'd download a car
11,01Where can I get a car torrent?
I would if I could drive.
05,15but would you download a bear?
remember when ubisoft actually published fun games? just that without any of the crap? god i miss those times
He's...a bear.
CandyBar /)
Would you steal a McLaren, when you need to order it before it's even built?
Would you download a pony?
Yes.
PinkiePieCopy: Stop CLOPPING TO PONIES!
Yes I would.
yah
i still remember things like thandor or hell copter
05http://static.themetapicture.com/media/funny-you-wouldnt-download-a-car.jpg
05best
11,01Ubisoft was fine with me until 2009.
Japanda: but that is only an open source version, there is already a real size industrial replicator machine that is already producing parts for cars.
05image
05EVER
11,01Then they helped seed my hate for game publishers.
Tangible? I downloaded my tangible pony yesterday
CandyBar, O U.
Snuffsis: Well, that's nifty.
The music industry used to sell CDs with only 3 good songs in them for $20. That was pretty stupid.
05Japanda, i clop to whatever the fuck i want
I don't mind companies making money, but they shouldn't treat their customers like thieves with DRM and signin in online to play the game everytime you want to
CandyBar: is it meant to be a white screen?
that's just cruel
05,15Why are we talking about clopping?
Japanda: Althought, good luck paying for the machine and raw amterials, and fitting it on your desk. xD
/me shrugpony
I'm be a pirate and NOBODY CAN STOP ME :-D
/me slaps Dashie_Dashie around a bit with a large trout
Erryday ahm cloppin'
00,03If you're happy and you know it, clop your hands!
05,15Yar har fiddle de dee you are a pirate
00,03wait...
11,01Ubisoft says that the DRM is working, but they've seen a 90% drop in PC sales at the same time since it was introduced.
clop clop
I wonder - if a pirate gives you pirated goods, are you a pirate?
ponis have hands?
Snuffsis: You got a point, the cost of the printer and materials are akin to buying a laptop and an internet connection.
the biggest fucking joke is that the only ones effected by DRM are the USERS!
CandyBar: if it weren't that way, it wouldn't be clopping
CLOPPING PARTY!
the pirates are just fine, they could't give less of a shit
Give me your best piratical arrrr.
Oh god
R
the ones who bought games with DRM? well sorry guys, you're fucke
http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones Why We Pirate
We should have a clopping party whenever trolls show up. it would confuse them
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3qS0odekuU
yes lol
11,01Dark__Horst: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/5385-Ubisoft
Tovler: I AGREE 500%
I hate pears
Nittany_Discord: Isn't that the best irony in the world? And still they wonder why people pirate the game, maybe because they can't play it otherwise?! :P
11,01Yeah.
05,15Well River...THAT wasn't sexual at all
lol Nit. I've seen that before.
PEAARS
You can only chose two: http://i.imgur.com/ohC6c.jpg
Nittany_Discord: yep. saw that B)
11,01I turned down a video card because it came with an Ubisoft game.
11,01I wasn't going to play something with that DRM in it.
I'd like to spike the Mayor
portal gun and everlasting thingy ~
This is crazy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trCf9eCmIHY
fluttercry: She's a screamer.
kay i was gone...i cant rmember but werent we supposed to stream something
Nittany_Discord: DRM is like a dirty prostitute. May be dirty, but you still have sex with her.
11,01Then you have the other publishers.
Nittany_Discord: Play the game or quit PC gaming
05,15Meanwhile I like how you knew EXACTLY what I was refering to
Japanda - no.
05rather quit PC gaming than allow DRM in my games
no, we don't
fluttercry: I'm pretty good with quotes.
aLL my games have DRM
05nope.
it's not a problem with ME
lol CandyBar
i bought anno 2070 recently, didn't know about the drm at the time
11,01Good for you.
05WRONG
The only item I would like is the portal gun
Infact, I LOVE DRM
05oblivion didnt have DRM
i have explictly refused to purchase Battlefield 3, a game I would have otherwise purchased, specifically because it uses Origin as DRM
11,01Good for you.
Certain DRMs are fine though.
I mean really
imagine my wrath when i found out that i have only a three install limit
CandyBar steam = DRM
i have explicitly turned down a free copy of Borderlands because it uses SecuROM
But the shit that says "You're offline, you can't play this game" is just too much.
has no idea what your all talking about
/me goes back to watching ponies
install limit ? what is this i dont even...
Stop downloading Pornography on your computer and you won't have to redownload the game onto a new computer
IN HD.
05which is why i dont buy games on steam
wait so whats a drm? i might remember if you explain it
And that you only have a limited number of installs and shit.
wat drm
11,01Snuffsis has it right. Certain DRM I'm fine with.
you know, getting games from torrents dont have drm
Hay, listen.
11,01Even SecuROM
Bluestrom_S, CandyBar, Steam is a "get the eff out of the way" DRM
05,15Wrek has Deus Ex HR...doesn't use steam you can't explain that
I just ask my cousing "Hey, do you have X game" ; "Sure thing. Here you go."
and in all honestly, any DRM it uses is publisher made
11,01But I fucking refuse to buy a game requiring me to be online to play SP.
and now time for techno scootaloo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VBIe0R2e-A
oh that ea is infamous for that cause their afraid of getting pirated
DRMs are the publishers own crappy steams
you can run the Fallout games without having Steam turned on, offline or otherwise, for example
I have lots of games on steam, most are indie games though.
What's DRM?
/me doesn't care a wink about Steam as DRM on the grounds that it doesn't interfere with my ability to play my games.
00,03fluttercry: Wrek never asked for that...
:D
05implying i buy my games and havent gotten them gifted or thorugh comissions
distribution platforms that come with all kinds of needle-dildos for the law abiding user

Polydunami: How much wood can a wood chuck chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck WOOD
digimon
Pinkies4thWall - Digital Rights Management. it's supposed to restrict illegal copies of games
DRM = digital Rights management, it's software meant to prevent pirating, but usually ends up screwing over legit customers more.

Wrek pirates ALL the things.
Polydunami: How much DRM can a PC gamer complain about if a Pc gamer could complain about DRM
most often by limiting how many times a specific CD or account can install a game
digimon
05,15Wrek, modern day Viking.
only game ive been gifted was nation red
so that you can't just download it once and give those files to everyone and their friends
so, like how i need the borderlands disk in my xbox to play it?
I really don't like DRM, it just complicates things
yeh drm only takes the pirates a day to crack, but causes customers to have all kinds of problems
Pinkies4thWall - not exactly
i usially pirate stuff to try it out ~ if game is good i'll buy it ~
but it's similar
Umm... I'm not knowledgable in this department
/me brinhurt
Pinkies4thWall: yeah you do
in that case, only one person can use the game at once for a given CD
think of it this way
Dken2021: It doesn't complicate anything. Stop download pornography and you'll be FINE
umm... 528491?
assume you could install Borderlands to your XBOX so you don't need the CD in it
Does anyone here remember the Starcraft and Diablo Spawn feature?
Damn i miss that
Borderlands. whadda piece o' crap.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgbM5ldws7c&feature=related
Dken2021: ANd any RESPECTABLE pc gamer has atleast a 2mbit constant net connetion.
DRM would make it extremely difficult for someone to take your CD and install it on their XBOX as well
It kind of is amusing. Can't get into beta? Can't get a demo? Pirate to try it out must be the last option.
Zealot: Listening to music, wanting to RP an so on
no installing it only makes loads faster and play smoother
i'm looking forward to mass effect 3 and syndicate. why? becasue that's m,y chance to say FUCK YOU to EA for origin. pirate ALL THE GAMES!
you still need the disk
or else you cant play the game
or if it didn't make it difficult, it would at least include some way to limit the number of XBOXes you could install the game to
o look, The industry is trying to kill Netflix again. And people wonder why we are pirates.
Jesus this topic is lasting a long time.
well CandyBar what your take on a 50/60 AAA game
05need the disk to play a game? even a game oyu legally own? screw that use a crack
MirrorImage: installing the game to the consolle makes the game run quieter and faster
Still need the disk
Netflix was doing good, until... *must. resist. joke*
What CandyBar said, use a crack isntead.
Okay, time to Youtube and other things
Pinkies4thWall - i know, that's why i said "assume"
if xbox need disk or no game
I dont think ill get mass effect on release, ill just wait for the complete edition next year
I'm going to End this discussion once and for all. DRM is GOOD,
Wrek I was curious, what class do you raid with?
11,01I'd be OK with EA if they didn't use Origin to ban people from playing their games from dumb reasons.
It STOPS piracy
05nothign stops piracy
DRM does
ponies stop piracy
05no
I used to get game for my xbox for free CandyBar, until they patched it and banned my account until 12/31/9999
yet prates are still here
Hey Nit. Play some more Amnesia.
05it turn legit users into pirates
Steam does the same thing though. Which is ridiculous
not to mentions ea's customer support is almost nonexhistant
05,15Nothing can end piracy. people will always find a way around
As far as I can tell DRM adds to piracy because nobody likes jumping through hoops.
Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate.
Rip all content from the disk, upload it
Pirates are BORN not made
i'd be okay with EA if origin was actually trustworthy and their new networking system for BF3 isn't a pit full of bugs and nasty things
It's the same thing as if a store you bought a game at would come to your home and remove all your games from that store. :P
heh EA has no customer support, ever try callign them?
If you had the intention of pirating, it wasn't because of the influence of DRM
Japanda was made in lab 40 years ago during the age of chivalry.
hmm, maybe the industry is playing 3D chess. Kill Netflix, cause to people pirate like crazy, bring up SOPA again, pass it due to overwhelming piracy.
ponies
i mean really, i almost spent 60 bucks on that crap because i thought "finally battlefield again, gonna be worth it"
MIGHTY GOOD THAT DID ME
Japanda is like a time displaced samurai who does not understand your dishonourable pirating ways.
11,01Lemme guess. Banned from your game?
Japanda people will always pirate, but it's the quality of the game that will make it succeful no matter how much it's pirated
05guys i get the feelign Japanda is so snowed in with his revelations we should jsut leave him alown
05,15Japanda is Samurai Jack
/me is eating ice cream
^
no stream :(
Bluestrom_S: You got a point
i think we should stream something and stop fighting
not banned. but in won't run without trouble,m even now. MONTHS after the release
wTF is Japanda?
want me to stream something?
We should take Bronystate and push it somewhere else!
Japanda is somewhat correct: people do pirate because they want things for free. But there are also pirates who do it because they want to prove a point.
CCCP - if you need some brief entertainment, turn on your local Fox Affiliate

i remmeber the first month
05that user saying DRM stops piracy
nice fireball in the Daytona 500
DRM doesn't stop pirates. The only thing that stops pirates is to provide service that's more convenient than theirs. >_>
It's all about the quality of the game Japanda thats whats important
mhmm, I bought Black Dynamite because I pirated the movie and loved it too much.
it was a lucky day when battlefield was merciful enough to let me see the frickn menu
Yeah

My story? People give me their copies of movies, music, and games. I just take them and continue my merry way. I can't afford stuff on my own, so people are like "But you must play Bioshock. Here's my copy."
05AAA titles are overated piece of shit that should have died ages ago
So UNCHARTED 2 is overrated?
Yes.
yep
Yes it is.
I bet you all have xbox 360s
yep
And never even touched a ps3
I agree Japanda, buy he game if you like the game. If you feel the the develop put alot of work and you like the game then by all means buy it and support it
definately
hey guys i got an idea. How bout we take this argument...And push it somewhere else!
/me doesn't condone piracy but isn't going to berate it either. If publishers refuse to provide convenient services they kinda have it coming.
I have a PC. I'm content with it.
05i have never owned a console
There is only a handful of games that truly are AAA titles, (according to me)
I see this alot with indie games
yeah but less so than CoD
i have a PS3
i have an xbox and a pse and my freaking laptop ~
05,15Uncharted was not overrated
And one of those games is Dark Souls!
ps3*
05my PC got hardware worth 3000$
Bluestrom_S: Yeah exactly
The last console I owned was a PS2.
05does that tell you anything about me?
05,15Same here Wrek
Yes it does candy
11,01AAA publishers need to die. I'm tired of how almost all of them are choking the gaming industry.
AAA titles cost the industry money. They often need to sell several million copies in order to turn a profit.
CandyBar: you are a Console gamer?

wrek where you get to be so darn rich
05I sell models
My NES broke :(
I got my PC for 1,200$
CandyBar: it tells me that i want your pc
Built it Myself.
CandyBar lack a childhood :P
models of what
Models of ponies.
05I built it myself
took me 3 days and 9 cups of coffee
i put sweat into that thing
no nintendo snes, no sega, shrug...
05same here
05we are alike you adn I Japanda, come to your senses.
cool
You probably shouldn't sweat on electronics. Just sayin.
so Wrek can you give us your pc specs ? just asking ~
There's no greater joy in the world than looking at a machine you made with your own hands :p
I have a PC, Anderoid tablet, xbox360, PS2, Sega Genesis, Amiga 1000, and Odyssey
11,01I like building my own PC.
05,15Japanda strike him down, and your transformation to the darkside will be complete
Building a PC is, honestly, not that hard, unless you also install custom watercooling
http://alturl.com/h5jux oh my word. A MLP version? nice
lol after the mythbusters today yeah dont sweat on electronics
CandyBar: like, own casing and all?
CandyBar: yeah :p
/me longs for that day he can afford his own PC rig and put it together himself
05base specs
Because just plugging ing a motherboard, CPU, GPU and ram is like building with legos
I built my PC in one sitting.
thanks ~
fluttercry: But I'll dishonor my family.
mfw i hope to take computer bulding clases and dont know how yet:|
CandyBar I pirate people art work and use it on my own wallpaper :P muahahaha
I would not be suprised if this next gen is the last gen for videogame consoles.
I wouldn't go with water cooling myself unless I lived alone
CandyBar: Niiiceee
Last gen for videogame consoles. Pfft.
05but im ok with people using my art for something, better that than it lyign around on my HD
05,15Nah, consoles will always be around because of the 13 year olds
X3
05adn thats jsut the hardware inside the case
Bluestrom_S: watch out we have a badass over here ~ :D
fluttercry: don't forget frat boys.
why does every one hate on consols?
:D
CandyBar: got a gallery?
CCCP: Because Call of duty exists.
I'm willing to pet that you got a 2000$ drawing tablet Wrek, amiright?
05got a 24" PB screen in center, with 2 adjacent 17"
bet*
05latest G19
The nextgen will die if they go threw with the anti used game tech
05razer diamond back
I don't hate consoles, but I'm sorta drifting towards PC gaming a bit
It just will
05an intous 4 wacom
05,15because why get a computer that only plays games...when you can get a computer that does everything? That's why consoles are hated on
So it's ok if i use your art as my profile pic for face or somthing like that
Not really sure. I guess people like the diversity of the PC with the Internet while consoles can seem limiting. I like both really.
Also because Call of Duty exists.
haha i just turned 14 11 days ago now i dony seem like such a brat fluttercry was talking about
PS3 could install Linux before
But then they removed it. <.<

It's getting too expensive to make AAA games. So the graphics in games will stay the same for a while at least until the economy recovers. Meanwhile, PCs will continue to become more powerful.

My Little Dashie is the best Fan Fic EVER
05as long as your computer is opted for the way you use it you're fine

Snuffsis: Why do you think Audiophiles spend hundreds of dollars on Sound systems?
Pffft. CoD with their 60FPS
05,15My Little Dashie uses cheap cliches in an attempt to make you feel sad. It was forced
05,15it wasn't genuine sadness
Snuffsis: When 100$ headphones will do the Job.
(Frames per Second)
the reason i cried from my little dashie was not because of the characters lost of an adopted child, but the relization that i had waisted 2 hours reading nothing
But I'd just buy the case secondhand and hack the lighting my self
CandyBar what's your spec?
Snuffsis: They want the best thing possible.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV0YSoTXsfU yay, japan
OR 300$ HADPHONES BY BOSE
Japanda: Audiophiles spend that much on music quality because they are obsessed with music quality.
i'm pregnant
SilverStreak: congrats
If it's a boy name it Chewbacca.
Yup
Japanda: PC Gamers, playing pro, aren't obsessed with the graphics quality, but rather their own skills.
XD
05,15I will say, the lights on my alienware and being able to edit them...Totally worth the money
it's a girl call her lyra~
Snuffsis: I plan on dumping another 1,000$ into my RIG.
MLD imo was very well written i had problems with it but all in all it was one of if not the best fan fic ive ever read EVER
girl, name it lasagna
i say that to make people shut up
what am I watching?
i'm not really
SilverStreak: did not work ~
Lol. Luanne from KoTH
Is Bowers & Wilkins better than Bose?

If the writer wasn't so Amateur at the craft.
MLD what's dat?
When i get surround sound for my room, it'll most likely be bose
seems kinda right, still i like it for what it was
The Rainbow Factory was sadder, but still had bad dialogue.
Thats why I dont usually read fanfics
Snuffsis: the greatest peice of art in human history
I like the RDP version of rainbow factory
Walk by Mom to eat or stay in room. Choices choices.
05,15Oh shit I have a paper due in an hour and a half
05,15FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU
The writing isnt as good as actual books
MLD is Picasso?
00,03There's cookies and punch by the door!
After I finished reading My Little Dashie. I was astounded...at that moment at time I relized something, I can read.
CupcakeWarrior: i think its better
where is that pic of bronystate punching a girl in the face ?
PUNCH!
:D I liek cookies
Snuffsis: MLD is a 'sad' fic that uses every possible cliché in sad writing in order to make you sad. that's all. Don't waste your time with it.
The best Fan fiction I've ever read was one with Malfoy as he tried to do Algebra, It was great.
That is true, Meanwhile
Oh, my little dashie?
http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
Snuffsis: dont listen to Meanwhile
No, My Little Dumplings.
However, it is a very good story
The best fanfiction I read was Spiderses
I read that one for the first time today Snuffsis
I don't really read fan fic, they're usually horrible, and i don't want to ruin the show for me. :P

yea, math is one of those things you can't teach that well
Mmm Mountain due.

11,01Math was so slowly taught for me. Spent too much time on Arithmetic, which is bleh.
When in reality math is nothing like that.
Mountain Dew, even, lol
Math is numbers. Go figure.
11,01I didn't like math until I got to Algebra.
They teach it that way because of the messed up school system
Japanda: Math is just repetition and remembering the various laws it has.
<Japanda> Teachers just teach it WRONG <----- Hi, high school math teacher here. Care to correct your blatant falsehood?
Nothing more
Math isn't repetition
it's easyy when you execute it, but I have no clue how to explain it
I just found the lack of math application in real life situations.. boring

Math is hardly philosophy.
Dat SaxyPretender. Tron.
Every single equation in Math was derived from one simple thought that led to branches of Mathematics.
CCCP I know that feeling.
Japanda: Yes, but learning how to do the math is repetition, learning how to do the calculations.
Snuffsis: there is repetition in every skill you learn
Happines is just an illusion
Why else would I watch a show about brightly coloured horsies?
Snuffsis: In english you must memorize grammatical rules
CCCP is right
me once filled a camelbak with mountain dew at a gas station
See I hate this new-age trash that math can be taught through scrying and whatnot. Kill-and-drill is not inherently evil.
It just needs to be done properly.
Science was boring too. My school was having walkouts with the new principal. The teachers made up our grades as we played games in class
0,14Chat seems...interesting.
In philosophy you must write an awful lot about nothing.
Math is only boring because teachers make it boring

Walkeed into gas station, filled camelbak with 100 ounces of mountain dew, paid$1.65
Because math is dull as buck.

It's only rare because it's RARE to find a teacher who maes math FUN
LEARNING IS FUN KIDS
Math can be fun because it's really like a Game.
Again, you haven't explained how.
I respect Mathematicians, hell, it's hard as fuck to do math.
Math is fun. It's like solving brain teasers
I didn't go to school because it was fun.

HOW do you make it fun? If you can't offer ways to make it fun, you're just spouting off the same new-age garbage they try to force-feed new teachers in college.
You have a basic set of rules and you use them to solve the problem in front of you

Maths, philosophy, pysics, computing and logic they where my bitches in education
So maybe it's for the best that math is boring
You just keep insisting it can be fun but haven't explained HOW you make it that way.
Which leads me to believe that you have no clue how to make it fun.
I just explained it to you
I learnt calculus in one lesson
Math can buck off.
All i saw was a load of rambling about sudoku and such, not how to make math fun.
The fun is in using a set of rules and applying them in solving a problem
i'm failing algebra
Im failing school

I love math. That's why I took enough of it to earn a mathematics minor in my Bachelors, then went back for a Masters to TEACH it. Can't say I'm too thrilled that not only is some random dude saying I'm teaching math "wrong" (without having watched my class) but also seems convinced he's discovered something new about teaching, in fact it's been passed down by college profs for decades.

Japanda: yea, daribot does that
0,14Stable their butts to the chair, duct the mouths and then teach
0,14XD
Tutoring's a pain, but I see students less often.
I can tell you this: I've seen attempts to make math fun. The kids HATE IT.
restarting chrome worked
Once you learn the material, follow a strict set of rules and apply your knowledge to an equation. And you get an accurate answer from a set of steps, YOu are the boss YOU ARE
SIT DOWN AND STUDY!!!
*yay*
Because it's just the same mathematics disguised as a game.
/me smacks student
CK|Asleep: Because they know they're being talked down to
Japanda: wow that sounds positively ecstatic.
Numbers are beautiful because they are one of the few things in the universe that are absolute.
My teachers both loved and hated how different I was from the rest of the class.
Randomnerd: Precisely.
if you want them to learn math, get someone else to teach it to them. someone that ain't a teacher, yet stills knows about it. i, for once, got extra-lessons from my cousin for a time. really helped me back then
There's no greater joy in the world than having complete trust in something as precise as Math
looks like the steam sync issue is fixed now
Personally my approach to fun is the same as it was in school, ignore everything in the classroom and go kick around outside.
is it now DeadpoolDash ?
Japanda: you sound like a preacher for the religion of math.
yes it is for me
What got me Interested in math was I read some of Einstein's Theories.
Japanda: See, that's what I usually put up with -there's no certainty in History.
When I told my teacher that I didn't know how to fold a paper airplane, she told me to look it up online. I had the most interesting plane in the class, but that isn't what she wanted me to do.
Math isn't fun. I am decent at the basic algebra, though
mmm. Math doesn't "click" with everybody.
Reyes RANDOM NERD!
I teach in a very collegiate style, myself, and while some kids don't like it, they always ask for help, the ones who care usually do well, and most of the kids leave my class liking me rather than hating me. That tells me I did *something* right, considering I'm probably one of the harshest graders in my school.
yes*
I am terrible at math D:
can we talk about more fun things than math? like bloody murder and natural disasters?
But I know what I'm good at.
math was simple for me to do, that's why i love it
Dark__Horst: Ikr.
English: Well, at least there's s such a thing as proper grammar.
05,15Minimum 2 pages and 5 citations? Turn in 2 pages and 5 citations
I'd honestly rather discuss the finest points of the fic that must not be named than talk about math.
I don't like writing papers
/me won the science fair in 4th grade using paper airplanes as his topic
I was bad at English. I didn't speak until I was 5.
Randomnerd: That's precisely what I mean! History is unreliable and biased. Math is absolute and always right everytime. In history, there are bad facts and lost documents. In math, there are only bad mathematicians, there is no bad Math. Unlike History
0,14ikr, fluttercry?
i learned english by not giving a fuck and reading english stuff. games to
I started reading when i was 4
english was fine, I just don't like writing papers
Japanda: so marry math already.
I say we talk about Cthulhu
Taught myself
0,14^
You being a teacher? really?
i don't think about grammar or rules, i say what looks or sounds english
fluttercry I wub history :3
But whenever I've seen teachers try "fun" and "games", the reaction is mixed. It occasionally works but more often than not, they see the math and don't want to play the game. It stops being fun to them when they see the learning involved.

we're in a recession. the videogame industry can only make sequels
Does he look like your ex Saxy?
My Geometry teacher told me something I'll never forget " The best mathematicians are self taught. For one cannot truly be a mathematician unless one has the tenacity to seek knowledge outside of Academics"
/me leaves
mario_pony: some jewelry, their saved money, her boyfriend's father's gun.
0,14...more like my ex is left me for someone who cosplays as Liquid
0,14...which is funny
Dken2021: she's okay, just shaken by it.
Harsh.
http://www.shacknews.com/article/72576/zone-of-the-enders-hd-includes-2nd-runner-se I thought I heard something about HD version

Tovler: LIES!
otakon: oh man
Huh.
Oh wait, that's actually pretty accurate.
0,14...and I suppose the ship of those two would be...Liquid Ocelot
0,14DOHOHOHO
Saxyyy
Liquid Ocelot....
0,14also, that sucks, otakon, hope everything goes well
Liquid Ocelot. Cannot unsee.
That sounds like something that, as a kitten, I should be offended about.
otakon: how come your mom didn't want you to go?
SaxyPretender: me too man.
mario_pony: I don't know, I asked her if I should go and she said no.
#SaveDerpy
0,14In any case, my ex turned out to be a dumb <insert expletive here> and I'm better off, I think
I think so too Saxy.
Saxy: That seems to be the norm
That's thinking positive.
0,14DISREGARD SADNESS, ACQUIRE HAPPINESS
It's partially true. The videogame needs to start making more "Free"-to-play if they want to survive. or stop making risky/Epic games
There are better people out there for a wonderful person such as yourself.
I expected someone to react to my ZoE HD. Oh well.
risky? the industry? lol
I already beat ZOE
But not for me. :p
Why would I buy it in HD
0,14I should get the ZOE HD Collection
The brief delay in when I can look at your text and actually read it SaxyPretender just led me to believe that said "VICTORY FOR SOVNGAARDE"

BRB gotta do some quick calibrations.
Japanda: 100%
I recall the costumes from Blizzcon, hard work to do that stuff right.
Not really, Snuffsis. It's pretty simple.
mario_pony: Sounds legit
Japanda: Very basic statistic would say that it's 50/50. Either she is, or she isn't.
:P
I just don't have the parts or software here.

But a simple microcontroller could do that pretty easily.
So is anyone here going to try to make it to brony-con?
mfw that tiny man in the Knights of Badassdom trailer is from Game of Thrones.
Snuffsis: Ohhh yeah ;)
*Squee*
Garrus - i would if i would have vacation days at work for it
I say make a second brony con in southern utah
Garrus: i wish but i can't drive and i have no money
CK: Yea, i'm probably going to try and make a watch like that, or just buy one. :P
Be good for our ecconomy
and also be easier to get to :P
I say we make a bronycon in alabama
Silver_Streak: wait what happened to SilverStreak?
Snuffsis: ut you're forgetting something Snuff
because why not?
It's not too hard to learn. The big problem would be parts and software. You'd need a way to program microcontrollers.
alabama is too close to new york
i say make one on the west
And the hardware/software for that isn't really that cheap.
Snuffsis: That statistic depends on how desperate I am :D
mario_pony i have two. one for comp one for laptop
CK: Pft, just open notepad and make your own software. :rolleyes:
that looks like a very interesting movie
You need more than NOTEPAD lol
Look away from the chat for 2 minutes and I've already lost track.

Pft. Why bother with Notepad? You have IRC, that's basically multiplayer Notepad

379 mil
Aye, Raiders this weekend.
05,15Tovler I don't think you understand
05,15That's a lot of fish...that line makes it a B movie

11,01Game publishers have entitlement issues that need to be addresses badly.
yeah
Maid_Discord: but yeah, USED SALES! like for Kingdoms of Amalur!
EA can suck shub-niggurath.
I've heard a few publishers are pushing to make games console specific, like PC games.. >.>
11,01Meanwhile: EA doesn't want to give money away to Steam. They also don't want to abide by Valve DLC policy.
Don't see it passing, but still.
11,01Which forces publishers to release all DLC (PC) w/o exclusivity.
Humbug.
check this out, pretty awesome http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gFphKisP_w&feature=endscreen&NR=1
11,01Meaning if a developer or publisher wants to release DLC, they have to release it on Steam.

lol 96.8% moar wub in Broderlands 2
nope
Allright chums times up, let's do this. LEEEEROOOOOY JEEEEENKIIIIINS.
Dark__Horst: one of the key features was the HUGE selection of random guns you would get
but those trailer catchphrases made me facepalm so fucking hard
Pinkies4thWall: I had Borderlands for the 360, but got rid of it. I'll be getting the 2nd one, most likely.

maybe i'd give borderlands a go if it'd drop the cellshading and monthly costs
11,01I tried to get into them but faile.d
dafuq RoseyPony
heh
Better by 420% than CoD & BF COMBINED
Ya know what you should do Maid_Discord?
becasue,r eally, cellshading on a game like that just looks stupid
11,01Probably sell BF3.
Well, yeah. But roll a mage on Warcraft.
Seriously, my guild has been lacking arcane intellect for ages.

More Derpy overreaction. woohoo.
/me thinks Francis is a dick for calling Derpy a freak
It's not all that difficult to be better than a new 60 dollar map pack
DAMN IT RainbowJack
11,01I complain because it's a bad idea.
what?
they could just add 10 dollars onto the original cost
11,01It's publishers trying to get more money they don't deserve.
Buy a new copy for 60 bucks, it comes with one.
Take ALL your hard earned cash.
now what'S this about ea passes i hear?
/me hugs otakon
Placebo: no, they don't all the time. A lot of times it's friggin peer to peer.
we must save derpy
what online passes?
I wish Dead Space wasn't a bad game.
otakon: Was thinking of WoW, specifically.
oh
11,01They come up with things that customers will believe so they can rip the off.

a'www I missed Dken?
/me thought everything was fine with Dead Space 2 until he got the message saying 'Slave buy the Online Pass or you can't play online mindless Consumer.'
Borderlands is fun for a while, but gets repetitive really quick
Hazard: indeed man
^
11,01^^^
because you're free to that idea
But, co-op.
See that right there? See that piece of garbage you're defending? That's why publishers can get away with selling you shit. Because you'll still buy it.
11,01I played co-op once, but it was with high-levelled people.
/me got into Dead Rising 2 2 weeks ago and has thought it to be a fun and humorous game since
Otakon: you <3 borderlands as well?
I modded my borderlands profile.
/me shrugs
Pinkies4thWall: I enjoyed it greatly
borderlands is a great game, one of my favs.. cant wait for BL2
who doesnt want to see a grown man with a cowboy outfit on riding a pink trycicle in a zombie hord?
/me only uses sheild mods on Craw
Hazard: um, I have no idea
never anywhere else
11,01Publishers get away with things mainly because not enough gamers react to publisher BS by not buying their games.
otakon: play Dead Rising 2
/me plays some WOW
Borderlands came fresh, so fanbase was nonexistent
/me thinks WOW sucks big TITS
I really don't see the reason to protest a company for trying to get their money out of a game they made.
unlike some games
11,01It is an issue about supporting developers under a bad publisher...
That sounds like a compliment Hazard.
cough*cod*couhg
11,01Developers are becoming casualties.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHziLuIDRzM
/me said it as a compliment and a insult but mainly as a compliment
WoW is ok... i would play it if it was more, you know... free
^
Alas.
GEARBOX IS BEST DEV
11,01Lol CoD.
I loved vanilla wow
bc was ok
CoD sucks
wrath was meh so so
i still think Minecraft is the shit
0,14I'm looking forward to mainly fighting games this year
lol map packs
VERY loyal to their gamers
I really just want to watch the next episode.
Bluestrom_S is old and stuck in his ways.
If there's a problem, they FIX it
/me saw in Game Informer that it was the best Downloadable game of the year
dat Saxy, fighting mod!
0,14XD
i am looking forward to Fighting is Magic
I started wow when I was 14 back in nov of 04
loved the game
^
11,01Elite was created solely for making money.
I loved the warcraft universe in general
Bluestrom_S: if u got ur account cancelled would u freak out like that one kid on youtube?
shoving a shoe up ur but?
I started about a year before Wrath came out. I still love it.
/me played a lot of WARCRAFT 2
my gt is Pinkies4thWall
back then yeah
I love my hero
0,14I'm loking forward to, Blazblue Continuum Shift Extend (yes, I know it's out), Persona 4: Area, Skullgirls
1,3WoW was good through BC and picked up a bit during Ulduar, otherwise it's been going downhill for years
0,14and of course, Fighting is Magic
Bluestrom_S: I like the warcraft games and universe too, until i found out that it was all stolen from the Warhammer games... same with Starcraft being a copy of Warhammer 40K
0,14and oh yeah, the GGAC+ port
If there's one thing that's consistent in WoW it's people complaining that the next expansion is going to ruin it.
Every single time.
I'm waiting for Skyrim DLC and halo 4, that's it.
Mass effect 3 and eventually Borderlands 2.. That's all that I've seen that interests me this year.
well the next expansion is being made just to make money
ugh... halo 4... >_< im probably gonna play it too...
Halo. Now there's a really bad series.
Midnight_Tempest I found that out later too, but it all started when my brother and his friends were playing diablo 2 and dark age camelot and warcraft 3
I will never play another CoD.
^
when wow came out it was very nice, the universe and detail, the freedom it was great
>_>
/me is going to expect HALO 4 to be better than Halo Reach or he will march to the store and slap the clerk in the face until he gives him his money back
BF may be dropped from my screen, too
Meanwhile, if you want to talk about bad series, let's talk CoD.
^
^^
11,01I don't hate CoD.
We could talk either tbh Dashie_Dashie they're both as crap as each other.
11,01I just hate what Activision has done to it.
/me :) at mention of CoD fail
CoD is in line with HALO and Battlefield right now
I haven't played cod since 4
The friends I made in the game too is what kept me playing up until wrath
HALO > COD
Halo has a great storyline, thats the only reason i play the series... i love the story
Halo was my first multiplayer game, I'll never trash it >_>
im sorry I had to say it
loved it ever since.
No. You can debate Halo and Battlefield going downhill, but CoD's been shit for years.
COD > BF
11,01They whored out CoD.
Stabbing myself in the leg with scissors > Halo.
CoD hasn't really evolved at all
/me has never played any halo game
11,01I liked Halo.
I agree 100% Midnight_Tempest
1,3activision's good at doing that Maid_Discord
11,01I know.
I love Halo and Battlefield
I loved COD 2 that was my favotire
/me kicks Pinkies4thWall in the dick and shoves him out the door to buy an Xbox and a Halo game
CoD series in a nutshell, cut the graphics engine from previous cods, paste it in, use a new hub for your FoV, and slap in a few new guns.
new cod game
all else is meh 4 wasok too
At least Halo and BF introduced new elements, and at least attempt to appease their customers.. CoD is just.. CoD.
BF was at its best with BF1942
the BF games are boring, ive never liked MP games... hence why i rarely play any MMO's
11,01Activision's also invincible to bad PR.
Is BF3 worth it for the single player?
11,01BF games to me are too frustrating.
Activision is a GOD right now
along with EA
PinkiePieCopy: Eh.. Buy it used.
I decided not to buy BF3 because of origin
from what I hear no
EA can go eat a dick
^
I don't care for EA, but it won't stop me from buying ME3.
I really want to play L4D now.
if BF3 has bad singleplay, i'm not getting
Portal 2 is best Cooperative Game and best Puzzle game of 2011
1,3Portal wa gread
1,3*great
L4D2 is a gud game
Dat gread.
0,14I still need to play portal...
11,01Buying a game from a publisher you hate will not change the publisher.
i dont normally buy games anymore... if i can get it from TPB then i will, otherwise i only buy games that I like... like ME3
the sports games every year is BS, just do a roster update through a download
It's like the cod single player
Saxy you're missing out.
first time beating HL2 ep2 made me cry in the end...
0,14I know ;___;
i played through the story 10 times and it still amuses me
SaxyPretender: get Portal 2 on steam.. I still need someone to Co-op with >.>
Anythng on.
0,14this computer's a netbook though
1,3Saxy, can your PC handle Portal2?
0,14so it's AAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS for games
11,01They'll just go "well, we can screw them this far. Let's see how much more we can milk from them."
0,14Portal 1 crashes
0,14TF2 crashes
I'd love to play P@
P2
0,14heck, even Half-Life 2 crashes
most valve games crash at some point
^
someone send Saxy a desktop STAT!
idk guys MW3 had a DECENT story and a DECENT multiplayer but BO was better :P
bo?
Black Ops
BF
oh
Mfw.
Ace combat: i've put 600 hours into that game over the past 6 months
1,3Garry's Mod crashes all the time, but I suspect that may have something to do with how I play with it :)
0,14funnily enough, I can run Age of Mythology on max settings on thos cpmputer
Bowel Ovulation.
0,14WHICH ACE COMBAT?
I still say Battlefield Bad Company 2 was great
AH
0,14WOOHOO
looked like it otakon
11,01I HATED BF:BC2.
Saying one CoD game is better than another is like comparing a lost leg to a lost arm.
Maid_Discord: why?
i still have BF 1943 and it still is a good game
11,01My MP experience was nothing but mass-frustration.
i really wish they had the Ace Combat games for PC... that would be epic
Xbox 360, i'm #88 on the leaderboard
11,01And rage
no story but it still kicks ass
0,14nice
Maid_Discord: well that's just you, I had a LOT of fun with the SP and MP of it.
Ace Combat is best flight sim
0,14I don't have Live anymore, so my rank's probably droped
0,14I wasn't that good anyway
their making a new Enemy Unknown
I have LIVE
Saxy: gt?
11,01That's why BF3 is sitting on my desk unopened.
Hazard: eeyup, it's a remake and just like the original
0,14ThePretender317
Games I will never regret buying, Ages of empires, Star Wars KOTH, Halo CE, Twilight Princess, Orcarina of Time, and Tomb Raider.
Maid_Discord: you should sell it
it looks fun as hell otakon am i right?
11,01I don't want to open it and find out that I'm going to hate that game as well.
Hazard: eeyup, can't wait for it.
/me gets bored and noms on otakon
11,01Because of a steep-ass learning curve.
11,01With no tutorial.
SW Knights of The Old Republic was absolutely amazing
/me kicks off kirzstryfe towards Hazard
i loved it
and SW Battlefront 2 was an awesome game too
^
WE NEED A REMAKE
i LOVED it
Hazard: Knights of the Old Republic made me buy an Xbox.
the glitched D:
with actual multiplayer.
I liked the Halo CE remake
i loved it soooo much D:
11,01I've enjoyed TF2 with friends, but I miss games like UT2K4.
i still cant play KOTOR... i love bioware games and star wars but the game is just so damn slow for me... ME was easier to get into
Halo anniversery?
yea
Midnight_Tempest: get past Taris
0,14with KOTOR, Battlefront, Empire at War, Republic Commando and one other
Midnight_Tempest: it speeds up then
Taris.....*shudders*
god damn it Taris
otakon: i cant... its just too damn slow for me >_<
i had to try atleast 15 times to get past Taris
I used to play Battlefront 2 online with a PS2. Jeezus that's nostalgic.
eeyup
Saxy, what about the one for the N64?
:>
how about Resident Evil Outbreak?
PS2 online. I used to play Monster Hunter like that.
0,14I never had an N64 ;______;
being able to play SW BF2 would be pure fucking nostalgia
shadow of the empire was it?
oh
EMULATORZ
i would have multiple game-gasms
0,14...I don't emulate ;____;
Fatalis on PS2 anyone?
SaxyPretender: you should
i loved it so MUCH *sobs*
Meanwhile: GODHAND!
otakon: No. Monster Hunter
You spazz.
has anyone here played Homefront? if so, how is it?
Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2 + the side games will always be my #1 series.
The Fallout series has always been fun for me, even with all the bugs. the storyline and setting is what really does it for me
0,14I need to play GodHand
Meanwhile: I couldn't get the hang of it.
Fallout 3 was the best of them all
DeadpoolDash: same here, I LOVED Fallout
Hazard: um, nah.
well never played before Fallout 3 but i still love the hell out of it
Hazard: I'd say Fallout New Vegas is better
ugh... i really do hate my character in Fallout New Vegas... im playing on the Hardcore mode T_T so brutal
I've spent so many hours on Fallout 3, lol
Hazard - story, maybe, but i enjoyed the various things that New Vegas added to the gameply
Midnight_Tempest: that's why
Every tuesday the vendor for velociprey claws and bone husks was in the market place so you could stock up on level 2 cluster bombs...
Bioshock Infinite, that is all.
^
im so close to getting bobblehead trophy....I LOST THE FUCKING ENERGY WEAPONS BOBBLEHEAD!!!
0,14also, the only KH I'm willing to try right now is Dream Drop Distance because it has a level from tron: Legacy
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
also, I would LOVE to to remake Fallout using the G.E.C.K.
LOL
SaxyPretender, Y U NO PLAY SERIES?
you wont regret it .__.
indeed
expect a new fallout based on the skyrim engine
i realized i couldnt get back into Raven Rock and get the bobblehead and I CANT GET THE TROPHY
0,14because I lack the consoles ;_____;
you know, theres an MMO out that is pretty much a Fallout MMO... its called Fallen Earth
otakon - do the Steam versions of 1 and 2 not work on your computer?
dat swamp full of bobbleheads...
/me whispers to SaxyPretender.. Amazon.com
^
0,14I have no money ;___;
MirrorImage: I have the CD-ROM versions, I would just like to play Fallout in Fallout 3's engine is all
Skyrim is hilarious
SELL ALL THINGS.
0,14and I feel bad using scholarship money for games
for the story or the gameplay?
gameplay
not you hazard
the glitches are absolutely awesome
yeah
I have yet to have Skyrim glitch on me tbh.
well I'll be back in an hour or so.
>_<~
can't wait until Fallout 4 with the Skyrim engine
walking the walking dead.
Lydia and Meeko got fucking tenderized and blown into space
Fallout 3 mirrors Fallout 1 alot and New Vegas mirrors Fallout 2 a lot
has there even been an announcement of a new Fallout game?
oh my god me neither otakon
0,14...mfw I read Lydia as Lyra
short of the illfated MMO?
ah yes bethesda has perfected the glitchy game
SaxyPretender: I know that feel.
XD
SaxyPretender, to much poni.
0,14eeeyup
i would love it if someone made a mod
I don't really like Fallout.
for skyrim
with all pony characters
Still, I would LOVE to play Fallout 1 in Fallout 3
Falloutception?
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i would love to play a real version of Fallout Equestria
skyrim MLP mod is funny you hear dragons say YAY!!!
watch this, brix will be shat. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SE5owAIPmk
Fus ro yay
and you KNOW that there's someone out there with the free time to do it
i dont know otakon... i prefer Fallout 1 the way it was, as a turn based game... not a shooter
Hazard: not really, just remaking Fallout 1 using the G.E.C.K.
Midnight_Tempest: me too
Ghost Jerky
fallout 1 and 2 were great for what they were, tactical turn based RPG
lol
Attack of the giant mudcrab tbh.
otakon: also Fallout 3 had alot of similarities to Fallout 1 in the way the game played out... same with the similarities between F:NV and Fallout 2
well bye bye bronystate have to go to work now
DeadpoolDash: eeyup, and that is why the new XCOM DEFENSE game is gonna be AWESOME
Bye RainbowJack
bye RainbowJack
cya round rainbowjack
Midnight_Tempest: yh, but for some reason I like the mechanics of New Vegas better
see ya RainbowJack
cya RainbowJack
bye bye
otakon: wait... a new XCOM game? WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN!
dude
in Game Informer
Midnight_Tempest: awhile ago, basically it's gonna be a straight up remake

Ohai BronyState!
Allo Jaketehsnake

New Vegas felt like a more complete game(I actually cared about the characters in it, not so much in Fallout 3)
hi Jaketehsnake
/me rolls fluffily over otakon.
/me fires a crossbow at otakon's knee.
i use to dislike ponies once......then i took an arrow to the heart
/me let's his arrow loose
OH BOY HERER WE GO
MY KNEE!
that reminds me, at one point in F:NV your character says 'I used to be a Courier, but then I took a bullet to the head'
Midnight_Tempest: holy shit he DID
:D
Hai jaketehsnake
First thing I see when I come in is a NewVegasvs Fallout 3 Debate MFW:|
a bullet is a better excuse
and the Courier still had adventures
Jaketehsnake: you should start a L4D game.
its not a debate silly
Jaketehsnake: why? tis good stuff!
I've been watching some more commentary videos of MLP
TheOtakuAscended are pretty funny

Next elections, we must get Bronies to rule countries!
Who wants to die from cuteness?
Like I said before, not hurting yourself or others, I don't give a flying buck if you think cankles are the sexiest part of a women. Now, on the other hand if I don't like it I don't look at it.
well I drank a bowl of milk this mornin......without any nails.
