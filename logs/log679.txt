B-B-BUT LUNA ISN'T LIKE THAT.
Luna's one of my top favorite characters, actually.
but they just deny the truth
could be
THEY ARE MAGENTA
05,15Also, we totally need Trixie to come back, and have it revealed that she has no motivations, she's just a bad pony.
The HUE is magenta
Luminosity DOESN'T CHANGE THE HUE
05,15yup
Trixie is just arrogant
It's cool. Fanon evolves with canon.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrQtHB7gBLo
She's a braggart, but she didn't do anythign except challenge others to a skills contest and then beat them.
Her eyes a MAGENTA
PERIOS
PERIOD**
05,15I like the how to play garren comment
oh boy, the fanon keepers are out in full force
if trixie returns,she'll either have restarted her show, or be a homeless bum with no money to her name
How to play Garren?
DEMACIA.
oh man
And I doubt they'll dothe former after the Derpy Incident
S'all you need to know.
You spin me righ round like a record
05,15Hide in bushes, spin, win
Latter*
I can forgive bragging but being blackmailed? NO.
how can you even
05,15Miss Fortune? Slow them down, use the wave shot thing, win
one of my favorites http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA69aLMhy1M
Sorry, used the wrong word
0,5Nini
/me nearly got blackmailed and it wasn't fun
Also guys
Nacht BM.
05,15lol
05,15These are awesome
Derpy can never be the "Doctor Whooves" assistant
Comes back to visit the one cool pony she knew, has to deal with some ADHD nutball butting in all the time, and then has her friend reject her in favor of said nutball.
he's not even in the show
I was blackmailed once.
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=ELU3zNneAzAjU&feature=plcp playlist if you want
boy, you're grasping for straws
brb guise i am going to clean my keyboard :(
But they ARE friends
05,15thank you
It was more of a case of if you can't tolerate mynew friends, maybe we shouldn't be friends anymore
everyone needs to be friends.
05,15that would confirm fanon
If they ruined the fanon for every character I'd just laugh.
It'd be glorious.
i wish they would
When?!
but there is a limit where I draw for fanon and canon
it's my birthday!! i just right now became 13
like I do not consider any of the fanon facts as show facts for one
red's input: ...
05,15Season 3 is only 13 episodes because it's a systematic destruction of fanon
You know, the sign of good fanon is when they make LOGICAL estimations of the characters ALREADY MADE. You don't create more character traits, you work with them.
LOGICAL
AHAHAHA
Then it's NOT CANON
NEXT
wasn't pinkemina a middle name?
I said nothing on Derpy
It's her real name.
/me is at gold's house
but she's a rare case
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0Hk1HNfkUI
seems about right
no wait, her middle name was Diane
Pinkamena*
Not in the show means not canon
The eternal aether
Canon is either in the show, or confirmed by the creators
guys, describe the Yugioh movie in one word (besides WMC lol)
Ugh
zombies
I'm seeing a TV film possibly, but it's a streach
but I still can draw the line between fanon and canon
hi :D
Still no stream yet?
A film is possibly in the works
it's
It'd be like the 2 parter episodes, only without the break in the middle.
AND still rushed.

yeah, you can't expect it to be like this, especially when every piece of promotional work for it has shit like this involved
goddamn
Gameplay wise is still the same for the most parts.
Hmm. I'm tempted to pick Southland Tales since it would get WMC'd without a doubt
But, I got to go to sleep...see ya.
bye
brb another person signed up on my camp
nice
Its a pretentious political movie that takes place in a futuristic Los Angeles
awesome
Wut ius stream?
I'm back from my long-ass trip
Southland Tales is unbearable outside of the thermonuclear babyfart monologue
oh
It has no redeemable qualities.
None.
I see.
moon canon time
Is Season three out yet? I cannot seem to find any eps of it.
wait a sec, there was a powerpuff girl movie?
ok good
we should a dbz movie sometime
it would get wmced in 20 minutes
I have a decent sniper, I just hate using it
11,02TheRandomkid321: Awesome :)

i cnat say i liked it, but it wasnt unbearable, it was fun to laugh at, ive seen worse movies
11,02Number 39...not bad ><

The movie was fine
Oh.
THAT is a WMC movie
all the deux machina is amazing
mmhm, delicious deus ex
None of the DBZ movies are anywhere near that bar.
Even Evolution.
Why no one vote for any horrors? It's October! :<
*nothing to laugh at
I am
I am voting for Beyong Re-animator
Beyond*
Don't confuse "is bad" with "is fucking terrible to such a degree that it is widely blamed as the cause of all of the world's wars"
Bleh, Resident Evil?
Too much action >.>
I'm sure they'll do another Halloween event like last year
some of the rules in the anime are complete bullshit
k, back. I had to rage about Southland Tales to myself.
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/340/978/75e.png
night
you want to know a movie I dislike? The Karate Kid (2010) and I have good reasons to support my opinion
We watched that
I believe
with bleach blonde hair
and it isn't just "remade is never as good as the original"
*remake
the two movies are actually quite different. Different ages of the protagonist and antagonist, different time periods, different target audience
THAT WAS CLOSE>
*.
But Southland Tales only gave me aids
h
WMC generally isn't subjective. >_>
it was today
The only two movies to ever be WMC'd were unanimous choices.
all As I see
Some movies are just bad enough that you can laugh at how bad they are, while others are too awful for the possibilty of enjoyment from pointing out how bad it is
I think that was before they establish the WMC rule
maybe it was auto WMCd for being only 40 minutes long?
Speaking of that, did they ever air that movie here?
11,02Darn...
Pyramid of Light was noisy. Babes in Toyland was "There's 1 hour left?! k, bye."
(in fact, TLA was shown TWICE)
*during
Everyone wants to point and laugh at TLA. It can't be WMCd
^
thats my point
night everypony :)
I should watch TLA sometime, I got it on DVD
11,02Moo :D
The Last Airbender
last airbender
night
oh gawd
moo*
At least they were reacting to Pyramid of Light. Then again, we were reacting to Epic Movie
wuts this
I can understand why that got WMC'd
and I haven't seen it
me neither
(and mind, I *like* Pyramid of Light, I think it's adorkably funny)
Epic Movie....was just pathetic
or rather dont want to
I dont see anything
oh I see now
WAIT
Wasn't meant for you.
cardgames on motorcycles
Don't forget long. WMC movies have to wear out their welcome with 1 hour to spare.
Is this NiGHTS?
nights into dreams
Yep.
Right, the full title
I have a friend who's a local Yu Gi Oh tournament regular. He's been playing since he can remember and literally grew up with anime. When I asked him how they managed THAT style of gameplay, he said "I have no fucking clue."
the sad part is there really isn't a way to play it IRL, but then again, does anyone know how it works in the first place?
*"I find the fights boring" != WMC
We already tried to misuse it today, let's stop trying to misuse it please. >_>

I'm lost atm
okay what's Southland Tales?
Would Kung Pow be considered one?
It would be evil since I KNOW Southland Tales is WMC.
for Christ's sake why do people keep picking ones where the ONLY redeeming way to watch them it to riff on them.
Kung Pow is bad but because of Wii U, it pretty much has to be picked
11,02DArn
In Kung Pow
TheGreatAndPowerfulT:rixie dissaproves
ehhh ?
YES NIGHTS
I have an issue with one of the movies being ineligible to be picked.

night everyone
Just watch the Abridged series. They say everything wrong with the movies and show
NOT as a whole
My eyes hurt from playing TF2 to much. Is that even possible? O.O
This song is relly catchy
Wait... is this an argument on whether the shows/movies suck? That's like arguing whether toxic waste is bad to ingest...
Too much filler
Actually it's sort of amusing.
GX was a bit lighter
There have been some pretty shitty movies. As bad as YGO is, it's most certainly not WMC
play hardcore and hard
^ yup
I didn't even watch it once. I actually left
okay guys
I'm out of here for now
whichever one the movie was based off of was pretty comedical, but focused on a wide range of characters. The only one I can say bad things about is the one that introduced cards on motorcycles

WHY ARE YOU PULLING THAT CART LIKE A MULE?
Hi Rarity
nice pickup line
i'm not whining i a mcomplaining
<.<
lol
huh.
for a horse
I think this was the night 50 more positions were added to the khama sutra
HE SURVIVED?
You might wanna get some Clear Eyes Louis
That poor lady =(
Everytime that makes me sad
She was just trying to get some cans
That would have made an interesting twist if the horse was the gatekeeper
I hope they go into why the two possessed victims have such distinct personalities
There's a lot of things we're into
i'm the gatekeeper
HA!
i like mashmellows
wat
The depths of the slor.
lol
no shit sherlock!
depths of slor is best depths
gatekeeper possesses the bumbling goof, becomes a bumbling goof similar it's possession. On the otherhand the keymaster turns into a horny nympho
i think he's totally normal...
I kind of see the two possessed victims' apparent difference to be symptomatic of their environment... aka hsots
pizza on the face are the best pizza
YOU ARE GOING TO THAI
yes. :U
300cc's
