"How about a nice game of chess?"
Mediocre overall. It's not bad but does rely on some ancient cliches and some dumb logic. Still, 7/10.
"Yey, tell the Presidet! He should call Russia and tell them that the only winning move is not to play! We will bring World-Piece!"

If only Sumerpan was there he could have thown all the nukes at the sun
I got held up a few times and I didn't see too much. That said, I still don't know how this inspired a generation of hackers. There are so many logic and technical issues with it. But I kinda like the ending.

http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/past-movies/
wait, did we watched this movie a long time ago?
Rookeealding there's a list under "About Us"
switched chatrooms in hopes that his one is less crowded
The only real thing about we know about S3 that has been confirmed that we already know is that Derpy won't have speaking lines (Though Hasbro does like her now they're keeping her to the background)
Are we zooming closer?
Oh, DRAMATIC CASTLE. Sorry
Bjornfot: We did, ages ago.
Bjornfot: Back it 2011.
werewolves
I think it has the same amoutn of crowd as the other one i was in
:O
Navy_Brony no video links during stream
How many Mel Brooks movies has this site seen so far?
We know about the song,t oo.
What if that castle was a model?
200
Darf14: No, it was a style decision.
ah. thank you.
But that's not really a spoiler since that's common knowledge
Shizuka: I can't! Its a bar, its this or nothing!
Mannnnn..... those were good times.

Shizu: Seriously, he doesn't have his own connection. He's on like, a bar wifi

Bjornfot: According to this fancy "Past Movies" thing, it was one of the first films.
I think we're only missing the Producers and Dracula: dead and loving it.
See that otakon? Shizu hates your internet circumstance.

Spike should be grateful that dragon doesn't just START by attacking him.
Yol Toor Shul!
Why kill it?
Oh my
Run now
dem claws
Just throw it outside
FAIL
Then I stopped, and realized that the bug hasn't done anything to me.
RUN AWAY!
Isnt spike fire resistant?
you know when Frankenstein and Igor where digging out a body and Igor says well it call get any worse
SpadeMagnes[R]: they come out of the ground fully cut so don't be surprised
RETREAT
RUN
0,14but it MIGHT
silly show.. green dragons breathe cholrine gas
SpadeMagnes[R]: I think Dragonfire not yet.
>Can withstand lava
GET OT THE CHAPPAH
What MIGHT it do?
I realized that whatever it had done, it hadn't done anything to deserve death.
otakon: But i doubt they would be in such massive piles
>Cant withstand dragonfire
lol thats not a reference
SpadeMagnes[R]: think normal fires
spike is fire resistant, but not spike resistant
SpadeMagnes[R]: Not so much against DragonFire. Just regular fire.
it's just a figure of speech
I'M SORRY, TWILIGHT, GOODBYE
Bronysith: yes.
Owlicous to the rescue
reminds me of pesky flies
OohShiny: also good point
Mainly acting, but bit of both
HI YOU
i feel everybody forgets dragons are immune to fire
owwww
awesome owl
one badass owl
00,02OWL Vs DRAGON
who? its a dragon dummy
00,02OWL WINS
'who' could that be
oh
hoo?
Owl > Dragon
the green dragons name is leviathan
righto
Phase4: well if he was FIGHTING him then yeah, but distraction works
And this dragon doesnt burn the whole forrest down why?
Phase4: eeyup :P
Yikes! It sounds like unit 01
So instead I pushed it onto a bit of paper and tossed it outside. And when it got out in the sunlight, I realized that it was actually quite a nice bug. Its shell was a nice shade of blue.
Random thought Season 3 needs more Tank
Insert: Gogeta's magnificent scene
when that owl attacks the dragon, it remembers me of the Basilisk on HP
Twilight should be apologgising to Spike as it;s her words that drove him indirectly to near death.
LIGHT SPELL
USE YOUR OWN IDIOT
00,02AlienWarhead, yup
when Falkes attacks the dragon
*HORN
Cant see
And Twilight LIGHT SPELL
Basilisk
Burn down the forest
Doesnt use horn
I suspect tank will never be seen again except in a brief background shot.
then how did u get there
/me GUILE'S THEME GOES WITH THIS
So that was my epiphanic moment.
Random thought season 3 needs more crazy Twilight
00,02we need scoots episode
cher3ry: I hope not
Phase4: and a AJ song
GEE I DONT KNOW
we do.
...What?
she told you, fluttershy told you and you did not listen
more applejack
Another Pinkie and Dashie episode.
00,10Tank died after dash set him down on a cloud
I'd link it, but stream and stuff.
daaaaaaaaaaw
Like Griffon the Brush off.
hoo?
Whos playing that piano
Maybe he ran away because you acted like you didnt give a shit?!
and more Sweetie Belle
Phase4: and an applejack episode
More like her best servant
Explain it, then.
assistant first, friend second
Sumica: O.O
Except without the hate.
oh...i thought he was her pet................
So does Twilight ever sleep?
00,02Bronysith, we have aj episode
Phase4: eerr. applejack song
ECP48 Pinkie Pie
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
+Phase4 they should show Scoots family I don't think they are dead
he taks so much flack from everyone
yay
AND YOU NEVER TOLD HIM EARLIER
yay
00,02but another one cant hurt
d'aaawwwwwwwww
Weird dad sings about not killing bugs.
yay
God damn it twilight
yay
D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
Okay then.
yay
Not me.
We already know Spike is going to sing a bit.
hoo?
hoo
I don't sing, ever.
So that's one checkmark
*guessing
hoo?
I wonder at what point Spike will get tired of being called a baby. It's implied by the greed episode that he'll never grow up like this.
hoo
Where did that swamp come from
hoo
00,02dey took our jobs!
twilight is so adorkable
hii
Phase4: but we also need her own song for the love of molestia
all of my Daw are belongs to them
I really can't explain it, it's a freaky video.
yay~
I sing when no one is around.
This joke got old fast
Hoo?
She is :)
Hi StuffCrusader
and buffer
Fluttershy must be hiding
for the skeet footprints
I sing when I have a song stuck on my head.
No
Phase4: Dey terk ur jerbs!
nope
My singing has been known to cause rather violent ontological disturbances.
hi?
lol
only if you use blood
dem adorable WITTLE FEETIES AWW :)
Nice way to ruin it
Eenope.
hi
Shut up meg- i mean spike
dat facial expression was good
/me 00,02huts AttacktheAndalite
ding
I try to avoid it when possible.
05,15THEY TERK MAH JERB
hoo?
S3 needs more of Rarity being generous, less of her being selfish.
My singing has been known to cause people to yell at me to stop singing.
God I love the animation of this show.
00,02hugs';
Kandarihu: Hah!
hmmm I wonder if friendship letters would change like in season 2
/me 00,02hugs AttacktheAndalite
Kandarihu: dude, she's been plenty generous
/me hugs Phase4 back
/me 00,02and fluttercry
Spike did it before it was cool.
Spike learned that his boss is emotionally manipulative and sociall deficiant
that of cloudsdales being weather stability
LOVE! :[
my singing has been known to get multiple guns pointed at me
snore
Usually in class. I respond by singing "HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA".
"This week, I..."
DERK A DERRRR!
:D Fail
Dear Spike, TLDR
The Owl knew all along
No, really.
Kammerjunk: thats a good song
zzzz
Who.
hoo?
Kandarihu: when has she been outright selfish besides Sisterhood Social(at first)
hoo
lol
i spike will snore
Good lord, that's not fatigue; that's narcolepsy.
This joke was never funny
The last time I sang, an Eldritch Being ran screaming into the room.
;)
dat blink
tee hee
The owl knows it
spike might suffer from narkolepsia
dat wink

kirzstryfe i thought it would be a good Tenacious D reference
WHAT IS THIS MADDNESS
the only good part of this bad movie
Meanwhile needs to become mod
cult leader fluttershy approves.
otakon: you mean flutterponies.

Pleas dont get this song stuck in my head. PLEASE-FUUU
I will follow colt leader Fluttershy

8,6regardless, there was no reason to use /me for it
wtf is this?
/me died a painfule death of smooze
oh, thats were that refrence comes from in friendship is witchcraft
Wait, why?
/me dies
Because Trixie.
i think it would become a moustachtatorship
smooze looks like a pokemon
ooooooh this is what amooze is from
00,02i love the voice they got for smooze
but it's actually a giant pair of bloomer
Bronysith: Okay, that was also pretty good.
lol
i have the first gen episodes
I love how Gen 1 had some seriously dark moments
megan: I think it's an older generation of poines
00,02inb4 season 3 finally: Smooze
Now I know why Fluttershy likes this guy
I wonder what G4 Smooze would be like?
oh hi kirzstryfe
megan: scary isn't it?
So this is where grimer and muck came from
Phase4, mein gott.

SO SMOOZE I CAN'T TAKE IT
XD

Smoooooooooooooooooooooze
kirzstryfe Ok, i'll sing it again.....without the /me
You know, despite the presentation, Smooze is probably a lot more frightening than Discord and Chrysalis combined. It eats entire towns and multiplies exponentially.
XD
sound legit
So many dragons.
ahh yes
NO SHEZ MINE
Good night everyone

Lone_Lycan: it's dead man
Wow, mane chat is going nuts.
Semen hand in hand?
After this stream closes?
I think this is swedish or norwegan.
Seriously, what the hay.
Ofc it is
this is the crap version
Ghost30k: it's not that bad
I died four times already
these ponies are so scary looking
Non G4 pony is on
are you behind on the stream or something?
The WORST POSSIBLE THING Old generation girly GERMAN MLP
MY EARS MY EARS
I checked the posters at a local to see if there were some fim posters. there were mlp ones... gen 3.5 ones.... *shudders*
Kencolt: it's Swedish, and Luna's fav. And hiya man.
It's not like it's the End Times.
otakon: What are you smoking?
SO AWSOME
i see surprise
Reikim: so you found out it was viva la vida
Wingless Fluttershy on the left
It's mostly non-regulars. BMN-onlys.
i win
Ghost30k: nothing.
THEY LOOK LIKE FUCKING REAL HORSES
That's the cue for all the newfoals to go "NOOOOOOOOOOO"
8,6quit your bitching and enjoy the music
i dont know
plz tell this is not g3
^
Newfoals can't oldgenforce.
Oh wait, this is german.................i'm not angry anymore, but i still deel awkward
THIS IS AWSOME
...I kinda like G1.
It's German
therainbowvortex: enope, G1
whats with the random kitties?
hey
feel*
This might be g2
It's German
IT BURNS
this is not g3
And its Dutch
Bronysith: I listened. It wasn't familiar before because it was only the strings, but at the end I caught it.

00,10Luna would destroy you all right now were she here.
i blame the changelings

Ghost30k: I don't know but he should share XD
that's G1 folks
pony_147 are you high?
So do I, G1 is actually neat.
0,14I just mute this and play something else
This is NOT german.
Reikim: lol
just as bad
my ears are refuseing to work
Val likes G1 too
But yeah, what Saxy said.
Sumica: she would? :( but why? I wub Luna.
Not German
there's a fluttershy look-like filly on the down left corner
otakon: -_- no one can even think this is good without anything less than a HIGH dosage of LSD
Ø
g3 is just shampoo drinkingly awful
yay
goddamn changelings
NO
G2 was mediocre, but it was definitely oriented towards girls who had watched G1 when they were little.
Val is a troll of unmatched caliber though.
Yknow, G1 wasn't all that bad.
yay
SOMEONE....
8,6for anyone with an issue with the Dutch pony song, feel free to turn down your stream volume and stfu until it's completed
lol
Ghost30k: wait, I never said it's "Good" per se.
TELL....
what language is this
this isnt german
ME....

Sumica What, why? I didn't touch her toaster!
In a kind of ironic way.
Reikim: Yeah, it had actual villains.
:[
WHERE...
DERPY....
If dari is an anti-tank troll then Val is a bunker buster.
Exactly!
Soul, no
IS....
I think I see some silly fillies whining about the content on the stream. You know what that means.
german
Reikim: not as bad as the g3. i mean fucking hell. so terribly animated
otakon: But you said it wasn't bad,
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT

lunac: G1 had humans
SHOO BE DOO

i think seaponies means the stream is about to be over
11,01And that signals the end of Sumica's stream.
Where is AquaPony?
Sea ponies? Sea ponies? SEA PONIES!!!!!!!!!:[
Faith heart we have batponies be satisfied
Yay ^^
which means #fluttershy is about to close
see even those two were like "Dafuq?"
SHOO BEE DOO SHOO BE DOO
Anyway, G1 wasn't bad. The villain was actually menacing, unlike the toothless failures that normally populate cartoons.
ya WE DEMAND SEA PONIES!!!
Sea ponies>This day aria
A Sumica stream ain't complete till we see this
Well this is just great
WASHED UP ON THE ROKS
NEVER
G3.5 is not G3.6, though.
How did Megan and AJ get in the clam?
I have to pause again
11,01It's already been closed.
However, G3.5 was still bad.
Sumica: thanks for the stream mate, was fun
FUCKING BUBBLES!
There should be Batponies, like the ones from MoonStuck
I WILL NOT BE SATISFIED UNTIL WE GET SEA PONIES
Ha ha its a good thing that im not looking at the air screen so that way i can't tell whats on the air so ha ha

What was 3.5, then?
thx for stream and movies Sumica

Sea ponies>This day aria

Wait, is that Applejack?
lunac: Specifically, mainly Megan, who was for all intents and purposes a 11-12 year old superhero-- as far as the ponies were concerned.
sea ponies
Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo

Rainbow Dash always dresses in style, if I'm not mistaken.
sea ponies

pony_8035: I would, and I can't swim which makes it worse

Or maybe that was just G3.
pony_8035: I was just thinking the same thing
show an ep from gen 3.5 :P
I'm playing laser with my psychotic cat. I hope I live... I'm going in! Shoo Be Do! :P
STOP SINGING GIRLS, I HAVE LIKE TWO MINUTES OF AIR IN THIS BUBBLE
megan: there's a god-awful Spanish version that's been played before
Oh yes
she looks horrible in this
11,01Closing the channels don't kick people out.
otakon Every time i think of bubbles, i think of this
I think that was G3
sonicandmario85: dafuq?
Bacon and Applejack.

Part of this complete breakfast, Meanwhile.
YOU IMPOSTER

Bronysith: Yes, but from G1 leading up towards and including G3.6, it become more and more crap.
Dark92Enigma: SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE!
That is a silly pony
Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo

Well then, IT'S AN ANIMATED LIFELESS OBJECT!
Nittahy_Discord sorry for asking.
It's not alive, but it moves...the implications are horrid.
/me eats Meanwhile s shoes
Whatever that abomination is it is from the darkest reaches of the hearts of men, where mortals fear to tread and the blackness consumes your dreams.
Hey Kirzstryfe: I'll play with you guys
Sumica: can't, just the view image link
Look upon it, and know the stillness at the edge of time.
kirzstryfe: we got a pony to play!
derpy looks adorable <3
00,10if only you had some way of figureing out the artist otakon
Also it's really fucking ugly.
00,10if only
8,6if you want to play, add me on steam, nick is KirzStryfe
hi Ponies47
Sumica: yes if only :P
11,01Stop making me wish my computer worked.
13it's adorable
13i want one
11,01I'm going insane from boredom.
Nittany_Discord: dude, at least you have net man.
Ohai LoGaN :P
wat
/me ties Ponies47 to a chair
Hey Shizu. Um. Are you sure about that/
?
like a signature?
Nittany_Discord: I was about to break into someones house to reset the router man.
I suppose I can play, though I don't think I've done Worms in ....god, forever. ._. I'll grab a copy though.
LoGaN: Lemme go! D:
soul: lower right
:D never!
i know :P
Nittany_Discord I wish my computer worked. The piece of *yay* won't boot up until you've tried about 50 times
hold on my steam is freezing up
11,01Mine turns on, but doesn't boot.
Well Shizuka if you really want it you can get it here. http://derpy.me/axGrk
/me whistles idly
11,01So, yeah...
is anypony streaming?
Nittany_Discord: no boot, that's happened to me before
So does anyone here have any good ideas for killing time?
Pudgeotto the stream is down.
no I mean Steam
the fun is about to be doubled!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcQrRwC2WDQ
11,01I took it apart today and put it back together hoping it would magically work.
Reikim: i suggest a .357 revolver and a grandfather clock
13oo an instant autojoin, i like this idea
silence
?
I'll brb
...
my computer wont work either it crashed completely and needs to be restored, but i dont have the recovery disk
14If you want to play, add me on steam, nick is TomDaBoulder69
Nittany_Discord: time to take it to a professional or get a new one man.
I'm confused now.
It's set up across the client, but ofc mane chat has the blocker for just this reason.
gotta get off here, later
11,01I can't afford a new one.
how appropriate
00,10ah yes the magic of just dismanteling it making it work
11,01If I could, I would have parts on the way.
00,10I always wondered about that one
11,01It was worth a shot Sumica.
Muffin0: I'm in the same situation with my gaming laptop
Instant autojoin?
Muffin0:use the windows disk that came with it and re-install windows that might work
00,10no I know nitt I have done it as well
Muffin0:i tried it before and it worked
I'm planning on building a new computer
but I'm broke
sonicandmario85: You can lose everything on it if you do that
* twitch
In the event that I am removed from a channel, my client will automatically reconnect me to it. Unless it's preventing autojoin or a ban is in effect.
sonicandmario85 i have no disks for it whatsoever it got handed down to me
09,01wise fwom yo glaive
Ah
00,10I think I have a spare MB and processer around here somwhere
hi NewDCD
oh ello NewDCD
Nittany_Discord: more than likely with what happened to my crappy E-Machines was the motherboard randomly fried while it was OFF and plugged into a surge protector
killerpony7733:you can re-install it or put it on a disk or USB
Ia! Ia! Cthulu ftaghn
Oh
OH
hiya NewDCD how ya been?
I am your host the man they call ghost
00,10Oh what cha selling today dcd?
Calm down.
Hi NewDCD
I get it now
09,01I have a most shameless question
Sorry, when I suddenly understand things that happens.
ask away
sonicandmario85: When the laptop can't go beyond where it goes *starting windows*?
11,01otakon: I think it's either the MB or power supply.
11,01I can't afford a new MB.
What is it, NewDCD?
later
Nittany_Discord: sounds about right
09,01If I sent one of you $150 in Paypal, could you use your credit cards to get $150 worth of Amazon Gift Cards for me? O:
:3
09,01I kinda need AGCs and well yeah
If only we could do another Bronyfunds event to raise money for Nittany_Discord's computer
killerpony7733:your screwed then bro
Reikim: most people would say EUREKA
or fuck yea i did it
NewDCD: and why not do it yourself?
Oh hey, I just realised something.
but you arent most people
NewDCD: dude, best you did that with someone you trust IMPLICTEDLY
Anyhoo yeah, now that I know Shizu hates that bug I'm keeping it on hand.
11,01Kandarihu: I was thinking of doing a contest to raise the money.
Shamroc: he lives in.. where again NewDCD?
What has Kammerjunk realized?
11,01I only need $150
09,01because I don't have a credit card to do so
11,01Less, actually.
Twilight's eyes go white when she enters that Avatar State or whatever. Mentally, she probably undergoes a change.
11,01Since I can use some of the money I have to pay for it.
I can use that!
13he has realized you don't want to taunt shizu
Hey kirzstryfe: i sent you a friend request
11,01Say, raise $100 to buy a new motherboard.
NewDCD: I would if I had a Paypal and my debit card would get through
team avo deserves ice cream :3
NewDCD I would suggest going to a store and buying a Visa Giftcard, but they have a $15 activation fee
Pool noodle of banning is reason enough not to taunt anyone.
Seriously, that's an adorable bug.
11,01Sell my copy of BF3. That's $60 right there (it's unopened).
Oh be a sport Shiz, I'm not exactly in the newfoal camp.
my pc has http://uberhumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/One-Megabite-PIC.png
to me, it's worth the extra payment for MLP merchandise
Nittany_Discord: you'll never sell it brand new despite it being brand new.
well im out, later
/me noms on Meanwhile s socks
but that's me
one mega bite :D
In fact hell, I've been here longer than you have.
Nittany_Discord: at best, 40 bucks if only bc it's "old"
11,01People will still buy it new.
11,01Even on PC.
11,01Even though EA is so hated.
Nittany_Discord: could try Amazon though man, they take stuff like that in new/like new condition pretty well.
Actually, out of curiosity, who's the oldest member on here?
11,01Actually, maybe I could sell it because EA is hated.
13sigh
im scratching my balls right now :3
That'd be DCD Val or Ghosties.
sonicandmario85: Dude, ew and TMI
TMI, bro
What about in this room?
11,01Copy of BF3 that isn't used. EA doesn't get a cent. Just a PC copy.
Dari.
So I'm sitting here at 6 AM, listening to the background music of Pinkie Pie's psychotic moment in Party of One.
It's unsettling.
NOT TMI
im scratching them through my pants got a problem with that?
SAY MORE
Nittany_Discord: sorry man, Amazn doesn't even TAKE PC copies
just . . . no
Sonic,that is tmi children might watch.
Hm?
please stop
...
Your name came up dari, my bad.
sonicandmario85: I think it's more that there was no need for the announcement.
I need to throw up now
sonicandmario85: Still, you wouldn't do that in a middle of a crowd or a bus.
Lunar_Brony: you okay man?
Now you've gone and amde me curious, Meanwhile.
made*
13time for the weekly "i've been here longer than you therefore i am better" schtick..
i only scratch them when they are fucking itchy
otakon yeah, never better. I-
That happens weekly now?
/me noms on popcorn
Shizuka: Isn't that what 4chan consists of?
/me gag
13eventually it'll be daily i'm certain
they were itchy so i scratched them :3
sonicandmario85: That's why we have bathrooms.
sonicandmario85: dude, enough. that's disruptive so stop or you'll be kicked or banned.
Kammerjunk: this is not 4chan
i found a disk!
Kammerjunk: thats really only a /b/ and /v/ thing
Well, I'm off for now. Probably be back laters. Ciao.
Muffin0 a disk for what?
/me gets Lunar_Brony a trash can
/me waves.
bye Kencolt
Shizuka: You're not taking this seriously are you? Because if you are that's my bad and I was just teasing about the bug.
thx AttacktheAndalite
Bronysith: Oh, but on 4chan - Or at least /b/ and /v/, apparently - such happens constantly.
my computer to work again!
You're welcome *pats on the back*
yea
but this is not 4chan
Muffin0 great!
night Ken...dammit
maybe /a/ as well
Good Goddesses, of course it's not.
One of the best attributes on Bronystate is that seniority counts for little. All bronies are equal.
AttacktheAndalite stop . . . please . . .
First movie night
mmmmmmm
Aha.
twiluna shipping
Sorry ^-^
I'll be okay . . . I'm fine
we need to see tremors again
No stream? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cy9gNE_vIE
that was a good movie
g'night guys
i forgot that half life has a nice soundtrack
need to sleep
Rule of life: oldest child gets all the good crap.
c'yall tomorrow
Night, OohShiny
bye OohShiny
Reikim: middle child is ignored and youngest becomes pshcotic
night OohShiny
bye OohShiny
Night OohShiny
...So Pinkie's the youngest child.
/me has just completed a game of BF3
Reikim: im youngest in my family
bye OohShiny
14Night OohShiny
hence the insanity
Mm. But to compensate the oldest child comes under intense scrutiny and pressure and generally ends up psychologically unbalanced.
^ me
kirz are you gonna stream worms realoaded soon?
:O
re*
insanity ftw
Tom is alive!!!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xcw3ZyBeZw&feature=plcp
it might take a little while for it to download for me
Tom is ALIVE
Also compounding this fact is that the oldest child is the "test" child.
G'night everypony! :)
sonicandmario85: are you gonna play with us?
jynx :p
yes he is where were you
epic vid :P
Watch out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaYAC5PtjD8&feature=plcp
8,6yes, working on setting up atm
I'm an oldest child at 16. I have a sister on 14 and another at 1. There ain't no goddamn difference.
gnight GilDash|Nurse! take care^^
13oldest child gets all the good stuff, until the next child arrives
i am youngest at 18
Well, my sister has a terrible taste in music, but that's irrelevant.
13then you're on your own
g'night GilDash|Nurse
Shizu knows how it works.
Spectrum_Rush|Awake: mind blown
afk
Pudgeotto:no sorry i only have the demo verison ):
my elder brother is 20 and eldest is 24
I can testify in support of Shizu's statement.
sonicandmario85: its only 6 bucks for the full version
i just bought it
/me yawns
my parents wont get it they are broke
Doin' setup myself. This is always such an annoyance. xD
Now that that's settled, time to go play some more Myst.
have fun raging
Meh, I didn't really have that with my sister.
Though maybe because we never tend to really want anything.
Man, you got lucky.
Hey kirzstryfe: How long are you gonna play it?
im watching a mix of smile smile smile and meet the pyro
:P
My sister also tends to generally hate me no matter what situation we're in.
I remember a while ago I had ~£500 in cash because I just didn't eat lunch at school for a couple years
Never spent any of it because I don't really want anything
8,6until we get bored or too tired, at least for tonight
Just ended up putting it in the bank
okay because i'm redownloading it and it's gonna take over an hour
:<
Good use of money, that.
Rainbow dash is best flyer :3
Pudgeotto: darn
kirzstryfe: how long till you think you can get the stream up?
why isnt RD part of the wonderbolts?
i just burn it
she proaly will...in season 3 XD
13it's the logical end of her character arc
probaly*
soul: why doesnt applejack have her own song?
soul: cause she's to immature...and well i dont think she really knows what the wonderbolts do on a daily basis being the "best flying squad in equestria"
13similar to twilight becoming, i dunno, master librarian at canterlot or something
Shizuka: archmage
Oh hey, I just noticed. Faust's original design for the Ursa Major had a symbol on it's forehead.
nah
there is no archmage
probably teacher at Canterlot university or some such
Hey whats going on guys was there anti brony in here or what?
xxMoopyxx: um not really or I missed him. what happened to your friend?
13point being joining the wonderbolts is the logical end for rainbow dash as a character, once she's got that what major tension is left?
backflip :3
Shizuka: hmmm excellent point.
11,01RD will join the wonderbolts at the end of the series.
...I like that kinda thing. It helps me think of stuff to write about that I'll just end up putting on a "To-Do" list anyway.
oh hes coming soon just give him some time
true all we'd have then is the shipping
/me hugs Shizuka "MY NET IS BACK!" and jumps about while holding her.
has anyone here ever converted a parasprite into a brony?
RD x pie
soul: it happens
Turns out the Sparkle family is descended from Ursa's.
13the series finale, or a lead up to it, imagine that one of the mane six drops out as we approach the finale, would have rainbow dash joining wonderbolts, fluttershy... i dunno getting a job in cloudsdale
soul: but not me personally.
so what did the anti brony say?
I still need to write a bunch of things.
The least of which is a short fic about Fluttershy and Chrysalis.
Ninjazz apparently was one by his one testimony
xxMoopyxx: no idea, I missed it.
what?
i missed it to
Yup.
twilight and rarity have to go to canterlot
chrysalis x fluttershy ?
No
Shizuka..rarity getting a job offer as a more higher class designer in canterlot..
God no
Why
or just twilight
wait wait
Why would you assume it's a ship
o thank you sweet merciful molestia
REsident Evil is getting aNOTHER movie?
GODDAMMIT
and AJ and pinkie pie...
I'm disappointed, man
considering lots of fanfics are ships
otakon...another....fucking A hollywood stop milking!
What do you take me for?
Bruce Campbell is a god!
00,10reminds me of how bebop ended Shizuka
Shizuka: I like that idea.
i believe the term is
who the hell do you think i am
BACKFLIP
Hey everypony!
actually Pinkie pie's , Applejack's and Fluttershy's lives are pretty static
BUT DAD THAT WAS A FRONTFLIP
discord comes back?
Shamroc: wait I'm wrong! it's a CG one
sonicandmario85: I DON'T CAAAAAAA-
DONT QUESTION ME!
Anyway, I chose those two for symbolic and metaphorical purposes.
13that was my base sumica
13would be a fitting end
otakon...ok that...makes it a little better
idk
Shamroc: and it actually has SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE GAMES
The idea is that Chrysalis will eventually be redeemed and metamorphose.
13except fim season one didn't introduce the mane six as slowly
Shamroc: Leon and Ada are in it.
otakon...i am now dead..
Oh, that's a neat idea.
00,10well save for some one dieing, I dont think I could take that as an ender
sonicandmario85: BARRELS!
She'll be redeemed alright
Into a big smouldering crater.
Shamroc: it's the sequel to that last CGI RE movie with Leon in it.
so is worms reloaded... team deathmatch?
iI dont think any of the mane 6 are going to die
otakon.....oh neat...having watched every one so far multiple times
This idea crystallized out of a weird moment I had out of nowhere, where I thought that butterflies are really quite tragic creatures.
more importantly....Spike (somehow) gets the girl
Bronysith: yes...or FFA
Son:DAD IM EATING YOUR PENIS Dad:fucking penis engulfer I HATE YOU SO MUCH SON
is there a stream up?
11,01http://nittany-tiger.tumblr.com/ <- if you want to help me get back streaming.
no
Keep the anti bronies out guys keep up the good work yall
Beautiful but short-lived. Living on the line between the beauty of life and the finality of death.
13sonicandmario85: That's... not appropriate. Don't do it again.
WHO WANT'S TO DONATE SOME MOOLAH TO OUR FINE MOD NITTANY?
I would, but I'm broke :(
^
11,01I'm not asking for donations.
and it sucks balls
Chrysalis > butterflies > Fluttershy
nittany what is your OS
i cant
11,01It's hard to raise money.
/me missed all the great character discussion :(
11,01Learned that from Bronyfunds.
The train of thought was, I guess, inevitable.
I think Dashie should become an adoptive mom. That'd be way more fitting end for her.
I'm back. Did I miss anything spectacular?
11,01Muffin0: Windows 7.
I would. I would also like to spend $150 in the steam sale but i can't remember some of my online banking details
Lunar_Brony: nooooope
For some reason, this all reminds me of I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. Specifically the intro when AM says "Oh, it's a lovely game, a game of fun and a game of adventure." Et cetera.
um no
let's see
So if you guys are playing Worms or something? Do you guys ever play it on that MLP map with Mane 6?
aw i use vista
11,01Steam sale makes things worse, too.
I have XP
Kammerjunk: that was a great story
11,01Not going to get donations when people are buying Steam games.
nothin' special
i have XP too
Yes.
I still need to read the story.
everyone is well meaning here
11,01The OS on my laptop is XP
but we're all broke
goddammit
Uru seems to have a lot of worlds that are just there to be pretty. Not that I'm complaining, mind you.
i looked at D&D wiki, it had draconequus, and one of the suggested male names was discord
I'm not saying i won't but i can't until i vist the bank on monday
Being broke has its conveniences.
I totally would, but I can't even pay for the steam sales.
soul: you are shitting me.
11,01Being broke sucks.
Howdy y'all!
hey guys do you know the dudes name of the anto brony?
hiya Everlasting_Joy
look for yourself
xxMoopyxx: sure why not?
i mean anti
HEY Everlasting_Joy!
/me dusts Nittany_Discord.
soul i'm guessing it's a recent edit
hi there Everlasting_Joy
11,01Having anxiety issues that prevent you from getting any job makes things worse.
Nittany_Discord I know that feel, bro
soul: to the D&D wiki!
Hey otakon and Bronysith!
what was his name
idk
13oh good we're up to cavcon 4
MahBoi777, this late night visit is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
13must have had a big donation party somewhere
i think i may have fixed my laptop but it says what its doing can take over an hour
Anxiety isn't keeping my away from a job
lol
Whatcon who?
Uru
hmmm
Oh hey, it's half past 6 AM. I guess I'm not going to attend archery today.
well im just in a private chat with therainbowvortex
13uru live is run by donations now, and the status is indicated by "cavern condition" or CAVCON, similar to defcon
11,01Well, I had a bad experience on a painting job. That's hurt me since.
and it usualy takes 5 days for what it says 1 hour
Everlasting_Joy: WOO
O_O I missed the entire movie night - I thought I was just taking a nap - then suddenly 11:30 pm - dozed off about 4
Ah, I've only got as far as finishing the pillar ages.
0,5Painting isnt fun. TOo monotonous
ohai BaconMane
Oh I see. Well that's cool.
13cavcon 5 is they have way more donations than they need to run the servers and are putting it towards new content, cavcon 4 is the next best where they're still way over what they need
/me glomps BaconMane into a fryer
11,01Anything other than academic jobs make me anxious, so I'm screwed there.
13it was at cavcon 2 for a little while which meant they were dipping into reserve funds to keep going
so either one of the mlp creators is a D&D fan, or one of the D7D wiki editors is a brony
13cavcon 1 is the reserve is dead and cancellation is imminent
soul both?
im going with the second one
But we're at cavcon 4, yes?
idk though
.
13ja 4 which is good
13about where it's been since they started
Then überbiscuits.
i could go for some biscuits
hot out the oven
with some sweet honey

IF I SAY ITS A FUCKING BACKFLIP IT IS A BACKFLIP

Cypresswolf nnope
Bronysith, get on Uru so I can have someone to complain at when the puzzles get hard.
cool :)
atlest, I dont' think so
soul: neat
sonicandmario85: Why do a backfliip when you can do a barrel roll?
Reikim: i would but i am sleeping right now
pretty sure there wasn't
Reikim: this is # 32 at your service
# 42 is sleeping currently
i think that pinkie should have been the pegasus, and flutter an earth pony :P
00,10why do a barrel roll when you can do a 3 axis tumble of death ending in a firey kerbal filled fireball
the main Bronysith you know is number 42, i am 32 the sleep deprived Bronysith

Bronysith: GO TO BED NOW! :[
Since when is Vegas new

kirzstryfe plan? Pfft. Plans are for squares
kirzstryfe: aww really?
i still cant figure out my talent yet though...
I just do sh*t as I go along
Canadian_Brony: http://i.imgur.com/3HZ6m.jpg
kirzstryfe: I bought the game just to play with you :(
Meanwhile and that's why
My OC is an earth pony with Oak tree bark pattern - an explorer :)
a Timber pony if you will
My OC has glasses and a cyan streak in his main
a lumberjack?
*mane
My cutie mark is two pillows and a teddy bear :3
i think there should be a unicorn exclusive city too, like cloudsdale
:P
8,6we'll still play later, just won't be able to stream it
I'm still trying to come up with a cutie mark
http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/ For anyone who might be interested, Terraria is currently 75% off, retailing at $2.49. This will expire in about 20 minutes.
brb
Im going to play some Uru live - anypony want to play?
00,10I would take a look at it if I could kirzstryfe, but i dont have it
soul: They do, Canterlot
Umm, hello....
canterlot has pegasi
earth ponies and alicorns
Howdy Sabershy.
though i guess alicorns dont count
soul: Yeah but mainly unicorns.
but cloudsdale is all pegasi
00,10I dont have an oc >_>
kirzstryfe: so what's the plan for the stream?
Uh, I am new, but I missed Movie Night, didn't I?
with an exception of the mane six
why are earth ponys so disrespected? :/
Anyone up for Terraria?
soul: Ponyville has a mix of all three so :D
Sumica: Lies, you have that maid. :P
Sabershy: yeah
Sabershy: Check back tomorrow at 2:00 EST.
but dont worry because they'll restream it tomorrow at 2pm est
00,10what maid?
Sumica: oh boo hoo ;p
Sabershy: By about 6 hours
00,10Maid is Nitt's thing
11,02I think Sumica's OC looks pretty cool o////o
Sumica: The one that spends your stream time doing the monkey in the corner.
dat blush sb ;p
Sumica really? What about that pegasus in the bottom-right corner of the stream?
Um...weird phrasing but you know what I meant.
SuperBrony64: Lol I wish I could get my own OC
00,10I dont know what you are talking about <_<
SuperBrony64: His version, or Wrek's version?
http://s551.photobucket.com/albums/ii469/mudde80/?action=view&current=Happy.png
that's mine
Sumica: yours seems to be zetta riouki
Hehe i think Sumica's OC is smexy ;)
Well, 3 of the Mane 6 are quintessential examples of their respective tribe. Applejack, Twilight Sparkle, and Rainbow Dash.
11,02Everlasting_Joy: Either one >////>
Oh. I see. I guess it couldn't be helped. Thank you though.
Pudgeotto:he has derpys eye color...
I know, didnt do that intentionally, it just turned out that way
:P
Hey Sumica, who made your OC?
00,10Wrek
whos OC is that in the link?
Sumica: Expected that
soul: mine
Sabershy: On the homepage there is a countdown on the right.
cool :3
Sabershy: That might help in the future
Back :)
Oh, neat. Thank you, Vinco. :)
Sabershy: Glad to help

kirzstryfe: This song is epic ^^
Nittany_Discord: YOUR MY BEEEST FRIEND

I'm not dumb I watched when the song was changed and unmuted it
Shizuka: This doesn't seem to be working.
13.-.
Good song
It's on my end.
13do not know why it is disconnecting you so much
Again, it's probably me >.>
Ponies47 I dunno. My parents know I'm a brony because a friend told them when I invited him over for dinner. I could feel my face turn beet red
so detailed @_@
:D ^
I have to go to sleep anyway, so this is probably a sign from God.
Canadian_Brony: Intresting. How did they react? 6_9
^^ dem friends allright
/me must aquire more pony swag
Shizuka: Sorry I can't complete the puzzles with you guys :( Night now.
Crush Kill Destroy Swag
I've never told anyone I'm a brony, simply because it's never come up.
Ponies47 my father laughed and my mother asked why I wasn't watching it with my sister. She's 6 and the poor girl has only seen 8 episodes
ha
I think my ties are with Luna I favor the night sky over the sunny day. Especailly in the woods. There is no light pollution and you could see all the starts.
Canadian_Brony: Intresting.
stars
Ponies47: what do you think ur dad would say?
what are you drawin?
Vinco: Tel lem now! Everybody you know now! Tel l your friends your family your dog!
what is the speed of dark?
*Tell Eem
I showed her "A Canterlot Wedding", though. I think one of her favourite ponies is Cadence now, surpassed by Rarity
My family knows I'm a brony, I just didn't tell them that I was a brony. I lol'ed
*Moopy bonks the chatlist*
Lol AttacktheAndalite
Boink bonk!
MahBoi777 no such thing. Darkness is the vision when an area we see lacks light
Ponies47: I don't feel the need. I don't hide it, I guess no one has noticed yet.
:D
Canadian_Brony: oh
/me looks around chat
DARKNESS IS THE NATURAL STATE OF ALL THINGS o_____o
PROVE IT
SparklyWaffles!
MahBoi777: I wore my ne RD shirt to school the other day and my sis comes up to me and says "Aren't you too old to be watching My Little Pony?" I insta-noped her and went on with my day
MahBoi777!

/me pulls everyone into a big hug
Ponies47: tell him the truth
:)
*Moopy bonks sumica*
AttacktheAndalite: NICE Lol xD
00,10uhhhh huh
Not Guile's theme but still awesome.
-_(\
hen3ry: My family is like that because I'm 20 and still watch MLP. I have a 4 year old niece so that's extra justification for me watching!
Ponies47: I hid it at first too. I realized like 7 months ago that it was stupid and I didn't care if people knew.
I bought her blind 2 blind bags of RD and TS and like 3 McDonalds' ponies :3
Ponies47 same here. Mind you, when my parents knew, I realized there was no point hiding it around school cuz I can just say "I like ponies. Ponies are cool." and put my headphones on.
Listen ok.......grass grows birds fly sun shines and brotha i hurt people
and yet people are still popping fireworks over here :|
I just need to get her a shirt or something and she'll be like her auntie! *sharp inhale and twitch*
xxMoopyxx I'm getting a t-shirt with that on it as a 4-week-belated birthday present
Hey, it's Bastille day today... well, it is in Europe, not quite on the West Coast yet.
Oh that
Vinco: Good :3
Ponies47: i would guess youll get 5 /) at six flags
Gotta love a national anthem that talks about the unpure blood of your enemies watering your fields.
hen3ry that brings me back to Social Studies 9. Wasn't the Batille a prison that was burned down during the French Revolution?
Canadian_Brony: aye
hey kirzstryfe you draw with a D tablet?
RD IS BEST PONY!

RD is overrated
*bonks sumica to sleep*
Ponies47: got around 4 /)
pinkie is awesome :P
soul she's my fav because she one of the reasons I'm watching the show. If she wasn't awesome enought to be featured in "Death Battle", I never would have seen how much awesomeness the show has to offer

Ha picking up a stream. Sound quite hard
Pudgeotto: Yep but again we don't know if theres a mod going to stream
so what does he stream?
therainbowvortex IDK. I just made my OC using that program and called it my own. I still need a cutie mark, though
8,6I better see an entry from you :P
killerpony7733, no mod on sight
ocs are certainly fun to make
My sleep cycle is messed up, so I'm staying up all night to fix it.

MGG
Pudgeotto it shows off some of S3
BUT IT SHOWS NO PLOT
XAX: WHAT
THEY'RE JUST SONGS
8,6it's still a part of s3, revealing a song and scenes from the show
which may or may not be included
:[
Pudgeotto: Don't argue against it, It's S3 many don't want to see any till it starts
I accidentally became a fan of the previous MLP generations.
SHOO BE DOO

You want something un-funny?
To Ted's credit, Tara Strong did voice the voicebox in his tummy...
read my original fan-fic
xles: are you sure?
Pudgeotto: Yes.
Pudgeotto: That or Tara Strong lies.
why would she voice for seth macfarlane?
xles: Tara has been known to troll us bronies on twitter
Nothing is more powerful than a young boys wish... except an apache helicopter... those things have machine guns and missiles
Pudgeotto Tara Strong is best troll
agreed
Pudgeotto: Well true, but she tends to brag about what parts she gets.
If I'm gonna be trolled by someone, I want it to be Tara <3
Tara is gonna be at Cantorlot Gardens and I might be going to Cantorlot Gardens! ^^

Ninjazz: I love nose boops especially <3
don't spoil season 3, or you'll regret it
^This
make sure to keep your season 3 well refrigerated.
If you spoil Season 3, you're gonna have a bad time.
killerpony7733, they are the cutest kinds! ^_^
13put it this way..
13if you spoil season 3..
I'm not gonna. I Pinkie Pie Promised I wouldn't ^^
13you will make shizuka angry..
13you do not want to make shizuka angry.
ohai Shi-OH SH*T!
Shizuka: I have seen you angry and o~o
ShizuRAGE.
Ninjazz: ikr? :P
Shizuka has hitmen
spoil season 3, you're gonna have a bad time
:D
13i don't rage, i just silently end people
I'm scurred.
there's a reason she was the inspiration for Kill Bill.
Shizuka: You mean *Looks around* (Whisper) the ban hammer?
Shizuka you're scaring everypony
13ban hammers are for the weaker classes
Shizuka "Silently end"? I don't like the sound of that. Would you like a muffin?
Shizuka: O.O
8,6I end people loudly, to instill fear in the populous
http://tinyurl.com/7z8uekw
I'm not scared. But I used to date people I casually refered to as evil... and who smiled at that description.
kirzstryfe atleast everypony will know I'm gone. Would you like a muffin?
/me Backs away from Shizuka and kirzstryfe looking very scared
/me relaxes
HODL ME! :(
/me makes sure that every action he does is not forbidden >_>
*HOLD
someone calm her down
Pudgeotto: Me?
Ponies47 do you want a muffin?
no Shizuka
cuz i'm scurred
Don't worry unless you actually do something bad or against the rules, Our friendly mods won't do a thing to us
:)
/me holds Ponies47
unless it's for the lulz, you mean. xD
killerpony7733: i'm still scurred :(
Shizuka.... silently.... end?
I wub all the mods but someties they can show there darker sides :s
hen3ry: Never seen a mod kick or ban or anything like that for lulz
*sometimes
Canadian_Brony: Sure :)
I'm used to mods abusing power
i've been a member of some chats that went to hell
I ain't scared. It's not like a ban will end my life.
Cuz that would suck.
Uh....
I like my life.
Canadian_Brony: but then you know that shizuka hates you, and that feel sbad
/me sets mode +ded wait, is that even a mode?
ev'rypony has a darkerside, ev'rypony has a bit of... Discord to there heart...
Pudgeotto: Put it this way if a mod here abuses power, Instant demod and ban i think
13remember kids
Pudgeotto: Back in the '90s we had a term for that. Bastard Operator From hell.
panda I have a life away from the computer
oooh I remember BOFH.
/me smiles
13breaking rules will take shizu from http://i.imgur.com/sFd9b.jpg to http://i.imgur.com/A5bdV.jpg in negative ten seconds flat
/me smiles nervously
dat time paradox.
I for one is glad that actual BOFHs are far less commonplace these days.
On the other hoof, I have been on #bronystate now for 2 months and 1 week! WOOOO HOOOO! *Plays Parasprite Polka and dances*
5 days. o.o
I'm scurred... again.
Shizu could crush me like a bug
13http://i.imgur.com/fgcR0.gif
Shizuka: No sleepies for me tonight because of that second picture o~o
Pudgeotto there are 15 people at my school who would prefer me dead and over 50 on the internet. One other isn't going to make that much of a difference.
Ponies47: Congratz, i'm sorta oldie here been around before the year changed from 2011 2012
Shizuka: http://derpiboo.ru/43481

But Shizuka, i got you a present :(
dt Gif
killerpony7733: I became a brony around when A Friend in Deed came out. Then joined #bronystate right after Season 2 finshed ^^
is she streaming what she does to rule breakers really
:D
00,02isstream working
/me is unphazed
ohai Phase4

Not Shizuka NEXT: Still not Shizuka
wats dissentia Shizuka? never heard that word before
00,02yay
you are streaming, phase4.
seems legit
Phase4: eeyup :3
cool!
*whats
ohai Phase4
HEY I CAN SEE MYSELF
Ponies47: I knew of the series since it was about 10 or 20 eps
00,02lets see if this works
i became a brony after a friend in deed
00,02lolecho
13Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: it's a reddit thing, that gif you posted is Karma and Dissentia, the reddit ponies
Phase4: Hiya!
00,02lets see if mirrors edge can work
killerpony7733: I knew about it sense I forgot but yeah I became a brony when A Friend in Deed came out :P
Reddit? Pfft, screw dat.
13before i bed, just remember
You're gonna play mirrors edge?
:D
I love mirrors edge!
yay mirrors edge
oh gosh them speculations
13http://fav.me/d4y0prk and http://fav.me/d56nuio are the same silly filly
Shizuka: I wonder how I didn't know tha , thank you Shizuka
/me 00,02hugs Vinco
hardcore parkor
This is what I wanted
Yes Ms. Shizu
I enjoy mirrors and edges. What better combo could you ask for?
But a Friend in Deed was not my first episode. duh ho ho ho. It was LESSON ZERO :p
/me is hugged
now the wait can be bareable
00,02dat shizupyro
but pyro sees rainbows and happy so its all cool
Night Shizuschlafen
Ponies47: I classify myself as a fan of the show and do not use the name brony to give name to it tbh
Shizuka reminds me of me. Takes a lot to piss me off, though
pyro just wants to spread love. Very, very hot love.
^
XD
killerpony7733: I see.
killerpony7733: brony is what Tara Strong calls you
Shizuschlafen, dat panda drawing. And night~
Ponies47: I am part of the community and what not, But i just don't use the name brony tbh
YES
g'night Shizuschlafen
MIRRORS EDGE?
Pudgeotto: lolwhut
NO picture o3o
tis true
Ninjazz hehe ^-^
killerpony7733: Intresting.
Phase4: No picture
^_^
00,02its blank isnt it
BGM works
00,02:<
Derp.
nite Shizuschlafen , sleep tight don't let the paraspites bite
yes
:(
Phase4: Make it so its in a window
I'm fine with just listening to it
gnight Shizuschlafen
nada
Great soundtrack
night Shizuschlafen!
Use a different screen cap program?
Ponies47: Simply put i am by any stretch a brony, I just don't call myself brony. Instead i call myself a fan of the show
"Shizuka" doesn't register a ping now, right?
00,02ACS13123, if you know of another i'm hapy to try it
killerpony7733: Meh. I just call myself a brony
Phase4: What you mean?
killerpony7733 I know what you mean by that
00,02well theres vhscreencap
Ponies47: Again your choice just like calling myself a fan and not brony
camstudio?
00,02vhmulticap witch is the same thing but not free
doesnt that do sreen cap?
Canadian_Brony: Some people kinda have a hard time grasping that, :D
Phase4: I cant seem to record things that take up the full screen either... try putting it in a seperate window o3o
screen*
00,02Pudgeotto, and while that does cap, it wont output to fmle
oh
killerpony7733: Right. You call yourself what you want and I call myself what I want
00,02i cant window mirrors edge
darn
Cant you?
I thought you could
Ponies47: Indeed :)
00,02there is a way
00,02but it would be amazingly hard
try right clicking on the Mirros edge shortcut and putting in a windowed parameter
There is always a way. And it is usually hard to do.
killerpony7733: :)
Option>Video>Show in> Open in window o-o
00,02Pudgeotto, already tried
aw :(
Dat Phase4 ^-^
00,02ACS13123, i have no clue what you meen but the options dont have a windowed thing
Phase4: TF2 and all that does... :/
00,02tf2 runs on the source engine
thats a good point...
00,02source > this engine
00,02which is heavily modified unreal engine iirc
welp
I dunno
what other games do you have?
Everything uses either Source or Unreal 3 these days
hi Deceptive_Cadence
suddenly BURST of text
on a different channel...
:P
Or Havok
Quite a few things use Havok
Phase4: If things simply won't work you could do kerbals or or L4D2
dide
dude
Phase4: you could just play and we listen to the sound :/
you have so many games
Isn't Havok just a physics engine?
00,02skyrim, y u $60
dat egineer
Phase4, still? :S
HEYA eveyone IM BACK
00,02Ninjazz, yep
00,02to both
WB Xaiden
Ugh. >_<
Phase4: Since this doesnt seem to work... TF2/L4D2/Any of the above/ Portal 2?
:P
Portal 2
00,02i wana mirrors edge
00,02i wonder
The new Spider Man film reminded me of Mirror's Edge
What do you wonder about?
Canadian_Brony: Hello,^^, yea I'm back, but only for about 15 minutes or so, it's almost 4 in the morning
/me bangs. head. against. the. wall. cause the sales, and he's broke

Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I know the feel i'm keeping myself from using any money, Cause i'm by high chance going to the BUCK convention in the UK next month

/me headpillowwall
BUCK
Why the fuck isn't BUCK in London
I wish I still had Mirrors edge :/
/me headpillowwall
Deceptive_Cadence: Cause it isn't :D
why the buck doesnt it work
Having it in Manchester was a stupid idea.
Canadian_Brony: But honestly, I don't think I'll be able to sleep, just saw EVERY Saw movie, along with The 2010 Nightmare on Elm Street Remake
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: lol dat's a new one
00,02aparently alt+tab kills mirrors edge
Xaiden o_O
Im very grateful for this stream :) boring staying up at night - nothing but ads on tv and everything is closed, even the drive through
/me headpillowwall
Phase4: That sucks :<
00,02stuff it
I'm gonna hit the hay. G'night everypony!

In fucking Manchester
So many people are going to get chibbed
Gnight, Canadian_Brony. Sleepw ell.

XD
Deceptive_Cadence: Well complain as much as you want it's not gonna change :D
Xaiden: or the cross that twists limbs
Laughed soo hard at how bad the acting in those movies
Eh.
Complaining helps with the pain.
cyber_pony13: ESPECIALLY THAT
Phase4: kewl
/me head......pillowwall
cats are trying to get my popcorn :)
Or the EXPLODING limbs as well from the 6th movie
Xaiden: actors were terribad in the movies
Cypresswolf: Silly kittehs :P
Ninjazz: ya missed the pony episode
Phase4: How do you get those games to run so smoothly on your pc?
/me puts another pillow between Spectrum_Rush|Zzz and the pillowall :S
they barely run on mine
/me headpillowwall
Or even the Hydrocloric acid Syringes at the end
why are there so many pillows
00,02Pudgeotto, good pc :)
That one was brutal
Xaiden: or the one where the guy has to pull out a key on a fish hook from a girls throat
Pudgeotto: 1. Get a good graphics card 2. Get a good CPU 3. Get some more RAM
^
That should work.
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, I watched bath. ^_^ Just missed the A movie. >_>
/me headpillowpillowwall
both*
Muffin0: Ohhh that one was good to
Deceptive_Cadence: Good Graphics cards can cost 500 bucks or more
not kidding
Xaiden: i still think one of the worst ones is crawling through all the barbed wire and your stomach acid is pouring out
00,02i'm actualy on a laptop
O_O
6th one however had the most ironic ending ever
00,02:P
Ninjazz: ya never answer my ping though :(
It's dark in my dad bedroom. My brother is sleeping, I'm on my dads computer with a little model of Willis Tower that lights up next to me. I am so silly :P
cyber_pony13: which one was that?
Your pony watches Bronystate? Cool.
/me headpillowpillowwall
Phase4: Yep i got a very good gaming laptop, Though it's still broken
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, I'm getting really busy. >_< I'm sorry! T__T
Xaiden: i like how the noise in the room couldent come above a whisper or else her eyes got gouged out
Xaiden: it was from the first movie didnt really see the 6th but how does it end
I'm so jelly of Phase4's laptop right now
Ninjazz: is ok
/me hug Ninjazz
I could have just gone down to the bar - that closed an hour ago - but as many times as I've been there, never curious to the type of crowd thats in the bar that late
00,02turn up ALL THE EFFECTS
/me hugs Spectrum_Rush|Zzz back
Pudgeotto: I got mine for a relatively good price
Phase4, Woo~
/me is apparently caveman ug
killerpony7733: How much?
00,02think this has a gt 540m
I think your laptop is better than my desktop
00,02but its optimus whatnot
/me gives Spectrum_Rush|Zzz a club
00,02so the only thing running on the dedicated card is hl2
Cypresswolf: that's when you meet all the......interesting folks then
/me bash head with club
Phase4: should totally get Synergy
00,02pings to a minimum
cyber_pony13: Well this guy William has to complete 4 CHALLENGES to escape, but in the end, some random bitch kills him by having a wall full of Hydrocloric acid-filled syringes stabbed into him, literally melting him into two pieces
I've met plenty - not my kind of people
I'm gonna build my own pc someday
00,02an i must try synergy
I built mine
cost me £1500
MR FREEMAN!!!!
:(
Phase4: Synergy is a piece of crap, i couldnt get on any servers
Mr. Freeeeeeeeeeeman
Pudgeotto: If we are talking dollars possible some 1638
Phase4: prepare to get mindfucked in this speech
Xaiden: now that is just brutal, so did he have the chance to survive or no he just got fucked in the end
1600 bucks
dude
I know
Haaha
who has that money
Gman is creepy
R.I.P Breen's V.A
Pudgeotto: My father knew the guy and that guy owed my dad favors so it was cheaper, It would cost alot more then that
Smell the ashes.
cyber_pony13: His life depended on the random ladies choice, however she couldn't do it and her son did instead
Loved that line.
A saved up
Ninjazz: ikr?

cyber_pony13: here I'll pm you a link
lol nocli[
Xaiden: wow let the kid decide huh so does it all end there and sweet i getz a link
My brother tells me you can build a high end gaming pc for 800 bucks
You can
