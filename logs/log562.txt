^ me
:O
re*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xcw3ZyBeZw&feature=plcp

Also compounding this fact is that the oldest child is the "test" child.

I remember a while ago I had ~£500 in cash because I just didn't eat lunch at school for a couple years
Never spent any of it because I don't really want anything
Just ended up putting it in the bank
okay because i'm redownloading it and it's gonna take over an hour
:<
Good use of money, that.
Rainbow dash is best flyer :3
why isnt RD part of the wonderbolts?
i just burn it
she proaly will...in season 3 XD
13it's the logical end of her character arc
probaly*
http://fyre-flye.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4axk45 A very interesting symbol.
nah
there is no archmage
backflip :3
oh hes coming soon just give him some time
13the series finale, or a lead up to it, imagine that one of the mane six drops out as we approach the finale, would have rainbow dash joining wonderbolts, fluttershy... i dunno getting a job in cloudsdale
I still need to write a bunch of things.
i missed it to
Yup.
No
Why
or just twilight
wait wait
Why would you assume it's a ship
REsident Evil is getting aNOTHER movie?
GODDAMMIT
I'm disappointed, man
considering lots of fanfics are ships
otakon...another....fucking A hollywood stop milking!
i believe the term is
BACKFLIP
Hey everypony!
actually Pinkie pie's , Applejack's and Fluttershy's lives are pretty static
Anyway, I chose those two for symbolic and metaphorical purposes.
13would be a fitting end
idk
13except fim season one didn't introduce the mane six as slowly
Oh, that's a neat idea.
She'll be redeemed alright
iI dont think any of the mane 6 are going to die
This idea crystallized out of a weird moment I had out of nowhere, where I thought that butterflies are really quite tragic creatures.
is there a stream up?
11,01http://nittany-tiger.tumblr.com/ <- if you want to help me get back streaming.
no

Oh hey, it's half past 6 AM. I guess I'm not going to attend archery today.
11,01Well, I had a bad experience on a painting job. That's hurt me since.
O_O I missed the entire movie night - I thought I was just taking a nap - then suddenly 11:30 pm - dozed off about 4
0,5Painting isnt fun. TOo monotonous
Oh I see. Well that's cool.
13it was at cavcon 2 for a little while which meant they were dipping into reserve funds to keep going
But we're at cavcon 4, yes?
idk though
