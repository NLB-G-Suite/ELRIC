/me laughs loudly
i have ideas
bad ideas that should never be implimented
Einstein, really? Nice
Oh the things you reblog Dema.
coLinux uses svn
people still use svn?
Hehe
github
SVN is popular in Gmod, that's about it
svn should stop existing
well- with gmod13 they wont use that for autoupdate anymore
its overcomplicated and less powerfull than git
Nah
I've never tried GIT, but I've never done a project with other people either
Screw you den chav
:P
And I don't use JS libraries or anything-
I wanted to play with you, but fine then ;_;
and it encourages open source
To to make PRogress!
Github is nice
>retrocityrampage.exe
but Sourceforge- how are they doing?
When I'm done witih my draw room thing, I want it free for everyone somewhere- and github seems more like a in dev thing than sourceforge-
I have my own website
but github is just easier
Ohahaha. There's a blue hat on the AjRarity.
You've got mail. :D
sure
wow wtb slot.
http://inspircd.github.com
'cause yeah, that would probably be ideal then-
sourceforge seems like svn
I just want a simple site that shows a changelog, and source dl for peopel to put on their size
sourceforge uses svn, yes
people*
and site
jeez, spelling
Yeah, but something like inspircd site looks good
"Download the latest version here: <direct link to latest version>"
Inspircd's site is more complex
which suits their needs
yeah-
but you can do it simply too
Yeah, I was wondering since I'd only seen the github sites for eh node and faye
Neeerds
/me puts on huge glasses
I have three projects on github
Here on browniestaet
one is ignored completely but the other two are developed
web app?
If you've ever used paintchat, and groaned at Java plugin and bugs all over, then basically I'm trying to make a noplugin version of that
Finally
yeah, for people to just have on their site
NPP
yeah
I use vim now.
xD
Aah, I've only ever really used NPP
using cygwin or something
I've never tried it myself-
/me googles
oh well I don't use any graphical version of vim
well someones got alotta mail
dat mailbox
Just realized you may have heard my voice
^ x10000
The joke wasn't meant to be cruel
