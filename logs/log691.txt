You now swaps FOUR gems at once instead of the usual two.
Open the game with a threefer
random number god is kinda of a dick
13you see this thing screwing me out of the fruit combos?
...
13jerk RNG...
btw what was the difference between bejeweled 1,2 and 3?
...
cachi01: They played the same, but new modes are added as the series progessed. Some that are very rare.
lots of exelents
VenHur: i've played 1 and 2 and imo they are exactly the same lol
oh yeah?
There's a classic mode in Bejewled 2, but you have to highlight the four modes in a circular order.
it looks the same to me..
LEMON GEM EXPLOSION!!!
Classic Mode is like Bejeweled 1, no Hypergem and all that jazz.
Can you twist them counterclockwise?
13YAY

13pink 11!

The object of the game is to get a piece from all 4 colors home. So rooting for or against a single color is counterproductive.
Whos streaming? Sumica?
CLEARLY THE DICE HAVE BEEN BRIBED BY THE CAPITALIST PIG DOGS
for the glory of cyan!
sonicdude558, Shizuka
13pink is 5 and 9 from home

Shizuka: makes sense
move a dot
13red has to roll 1 to get home
13bottom or new
so do teams always have the option of sending another teams square back?
the most recent one
back
Shizuka: Why did you feel the need to VM xp?
13only if they land on the square
home
who winning
13because this is a 16-bit program from windows 95, windows 7 can't run them
13cyan moves up 11
13and sends yellow back
Shizuka: alright
I hate the compatability on 16 bit apps
just use Windows 7 32 bit
. . .
okay.
13yellow moves up 2
haha
13pink 11 again!
ill move my bottom
appearently i'm attractive

Send Cyan back
13sonicdude558: you realize you can only have 4GB memory then
13pink sends a cyan back
Who cares
13pink is 8 from home
Shizuka: not a problem if you only own 4 gigs of ram
13you do realize how much memory the OS takes now...
I have 6GB of ram in my lappy :) and it sucks for gaming
come on #1
13red can move up 10
:O
new dot I guess
Can only do one move
13deeerp and pushes the poor yellow back

i place my bets on cyan
/me goes and turns on a light
Can only do one move
new one only
send the farthest one out
13yellow pushes a red bac
The pink dots shall win
Gee. 32 Bit Windows 7 could probably run PSO2 without Gameguard getting paranoid about system services.
13ooo pink 1
so what does cyan have to roll to make it home?
13pink can send red way back
ooo
13or you can be nice and send the yellow back
....
13or be really nice and have another safe

:D
TADA
13red gets a 2

Hmmm thats weird it shouldn't do that to you
/me dances a bit

Ohai therainbowvortex

Damn the stream is lagging hard

/me licks TheRandomkid321

therainbowvortex that can be arranged
No dude don't go to the moon
alexxm: yer where is celestia
:(
/me kicks therainbowvortex to the moon
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Moopy: dont wory they have great internet up ther

Ugh fine

/me licks TheRandomkid321 again

Good Morning Bronystate

Morning Gold_Demona :3
'ello you

Gold_Demona: alexxm kicked me up to the moon to meet luna
the internet is great up here
flyboy isn't on here. I hope my skype message got through even though he has do not disturb as his status
therainbowvortex: Well at least you didn't have to ride a Kerbal rocket to get there. :P
/ Allow for a plugin to insert a different class to handle requests.
what the hell wordpress
alexxm: It's interesting. My hubby's still at home because his work called and said "stuff's broken. Come in later"
what does he do Gold_Demona
hale servers (like this one) are good for getting stuff done
Gold_Demona: hubby lol
/me flips table
Gold_Demona, XD
Damnit why do I have to keep redownloading all these PF2 models? ;<
:<*
alexxm: He loads trucks at a milk bottling plant.
Simply put, he puts the milk on the trucks that go to the stores
I don't like servers with plugins like this. It goes against TF2 lore. How do ponys get into the TF2 world anyway?
TheRandomkid321, magnets.
magic
fandom
I knew someone would say magic
And who cares about the lore?
/me cares about lore
Gold_Demona... ME
Just not TF2 lore XD
I love lore, but TF2 is..just an mp game
Want a tissue diddums?
Run Forrest RUN!~
Vivix it has a story you know?
Yeah, it's about the gameplay, not the lore. The lore is just an added bonus that's off to the side.
I didn't know
but it's just an mp game, it's like how fanfictions can play with canon because fanon can never affect canon
so a mp server with plugins isn't touching the lore or canon
Most people don't even know the game HAS a lore
The trailers is pretty much all you need to know.
If a fanfic goes against lore I stop reading it.
what game are we talking about
whats lore????
That I do too Therandomkid
so after pinkie pie next is pinkamena right?
therainbowvortex: the story
Herp
but- I don't know
therainbowvortex, think back story and stuff
Gold_Demona: ohh thought so
but they can do it because they're not official
Like why Red is fighting Blu.
Applebloom hat! :D
AdamTheDuck: because they're ordered to do so.
AdamTheDuck: They're mercenaries.
Seriously, TF2 is such that the lore is just off to the side. The game itself is just fun gameplay stuff.
Anything goes
I know that GriffonCherry|Bmaid, I'm explaining it to therainbowvortex. But also think why Red wants Blue dead as well.
im so bord to day
AdamTheDuck: wait a sec, finding a video for explaining that.
therainbowvortex: hey dude
GriffonCherry|Bmaid, don't worry, I don't need a video. I know why they're fighting.
Moopy: whats up
do you have the internet checkers?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utdvpAGMJss
Hey no send youtube links
StreamisOn?
um i dont think so
for those of you who don't now the lore
that unallowed link
Moopy: i dont think so
check real quick
I don't even know what that is
Moopy: how
	function addTwoNumbers($args) {
		$number1 = $args[0];
		$number2 = $args[1];
		return $number1 + $number2;
	}
Go to your start window
that $
to be fair its a test but still
Phase4, ok, that makes sense.
moopy yer i have it
Boss medic was boss.
ok when you see the me turning the eglish off and on a couple times thats me
so i will do that
Moopy: kk
Just to keep a look out ok

Wait... What happens when you call someone on skype who's status is DO Not Disturb? Dare me to try?
Declines automatically
Oh, okay
Instead of setting my status to do not disturb
I'd LOG OFF
Vivix I was just thinking that
hehehe
Moopy: are you on face book i should add you
i don't have a facebook dude
oh okay then
Moopy: never mind
Flyboy has been Do not Disturb on skype for a while. You'd think he's just log off wouldn't ya?

Phase4, oh you :$
Ello there everybrony.
ello Malavolent
AdamTheDuck, 6_9
hey Malavolent
It was fun playing minecraft last night. UNTIL MY BLOODY INTERNET DROPPED OUT!
Oh my god, SO many windows, Phase4?
how are things Malavolent
Malavolent, there are never too many windows or tabs.
and ohai Malavolent
Malavolent, not enough
Just how good his computer is?
i would have more but windows has a crap window manager
alexxm: I'm pretty well, what about ya?
Malavolent, i7 laptop, 16GB ram
Phase4: Geez, how much did you pay for that?
plus being a tech its hyper optimized windows
Phase4 Did you steal your computer from Pine Gap?
a bit
i'm good Malavolent i picked yhe a movie for friday
TheRandomkid321, no :<
alexxm: Congrats, what is it?
Phase4 Well it's U.S military sattelite base quality.
I really need a new computer.
kung fu hustle Malavolent
alexxm: Haven't seen it, might take a look if I won't forget.
I want to send flyboy another skype message but if I do he may think i'm a stalkery over attached friend person.
TheRandomkid321, nah, Skype was made for people to spam you :$
Hence why I don't have it-
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
Lies Vivix, you and me get on it all the time.
Nuh huuuh
LIAAAR~
/me eats Jmo's trought
/me bites Jmo's nose
;~;
Ahh I remember logging on in the morning and getting spammed 100 missed messages from late last night~
Good times.
I almost exclusively use steam
can't get offline messages- no file sending
<3
but..that's what is cool
;~;
/me gives Jmo link to various filesender pages
/me doesn't actually do that, just types it as if he did
/me just like how Vivix isn't actually doing anything now.
<,<
Well then you're a silly filly then, NewSuperBronyU.
11,02:<
11,02i liek silleh :3c

But DashWithRainbows, you're too sane :<
Pfft
/me licks DashWithRainbows

/me smashes things
OHH
You got TOLD Adam
I got told? 6_9
By Dema.
You would know better than any of us what Wrek tastes like. :P
He who randomly licks people
Ahahahaha
But it's internet rainbows, therefore internet logic is applied.
And internet logic dictates that a fail = win
Therefore I win. \:3/
Who said you fail? O.o
^
I was wondering that myself
Hmm, good point :<
Genius.
Does that fail of me not recognising that there was no fail count as an internet win? 6_9
I just said you'd know what everyone tastes like. :D
Ah god my sides.
/me licks Jmo's sides
come on every pony join the new luna republic
You have a problem Adam.
Nope
/me steals Jmo's bones

Hey phase4
The funniest thing I've seen, is when the stable had a 2 yearold stallion next to the pen of a mini stallion
and they were having this SHOW OFF, of who could be the most rambunctious- seeing that tiny tiny horse jump and kick, looks super silly
seeing this*
LIIIIVEE
/me hangs on to Jmo and cries
I'm a muurdeererr
ohai Moopy
/me picks up Vivix what did you do
you like a little bit of metel
I killed the chat ;__;
Dat feeling when the thing you want most to happen in life is 100% impossible
/me hugs Vivix
Awww man. I had so much to live for. :/
Jk.
JS Chat broke me, everytime I see a dollar sign, I think of jQuery. Fup-
even money is gone from the association list
AdamTheDuck No that's 97% impossible
XD
Vivix, ikr
$ has nothing but programing meenings to me now
97%? Awsome! :D
It's eating all the other meanings, hehe
awesome*
Oh good, Flyboy got me skype message. He messaged me saying he did.
Why are you trying to message him anyway TheRandomkid321? :P
AdamTheDuck to let him know why I abruptly left him on MC and skype. My internet dropped out.
That's very important?
^
o.o
Dem crates

Doubt it.
Kids and people on the net is weird. I once asked a guy on a forum how heavy his guitar was, and he said he'd beat me up if he met me
umm
I'll keep an eye out for joins.
wait wat, why did he leave?
what happened?
AdamTheDuck I assked him to pls go
^
Vivix: Well, that excelated quickly
Indeed
How rude DWR.
.-.
How rude.
Oh you had to didn't you Dema.
Srsly
did someone get butthurt, and I missed all the delicious rage tears?
Vivix, maybe you just reminded him that his guitar is crap
hehehe
srsly?*
Yes you did Ryunosuke.
Jmo: :D
FUCK
:p
Not really.
Ninjazz You act like you wouldn't expect me to be like that.
when someone says pls go, you reply "NUH!"
DWR is an ass no matter what. :>
^
DashWithRainbows, sarcasm.
I like rage tears early in the morning, its better than coffee :)
Ninjazz Internet.

DashWithRainbows, ikr.
sob = tears, and noob tears are so so sweet :)
Anyways, brb, grabbin' headset and controller.
not full blown tears

lol DWR pls
moving downstairs
sob is a choke in the throat
what is that song?
It was just a over reaction to not knowing how to deal with banter.
isn't this from that hidden room in portal 2?
Buytoast, yeah
yeah, noone was actually mean-
Except DWR
He's always mean.
:>
hehe
probably for the better I suppose, I could have gone full troll :)
but i liek DoshWithRonbows.

I'm sorry Ninjizz

It's kay.
/me strokes Jmo the way a cat would stroke a bond villain
Funnily enough, that's more used than Ninjass.

Wow, there is plenty of space on the server.
Ninjass exsist too?
<.<
/me pats SillyFilly64 on the head
I've seen it used.
Ninjazz, is Ninjass your evil twin? :D
I could tell it was a hawk from the jizz
(not a dirty line)
>Ninjazz
His name is Ninrap
I wish to apoligise for my irrational behaviour a few minutes ago. I have school tomorrow where I am constantly bullied and I was just aggrivated by DashWithRainbows and Jmos comments which were probably jokes in the first place. I also have detention tomorrow because I fought one of the bullies so I a stressed about that aswell.
My more well endowed evil sister.
AAAAAARRRRGH DWR.
lawls
What game is this?
SRSLY MAN. 2FAR.
TheRandomkid321 When on the internet, try not to take everything so seriously.
Ninrap
tf?
Most of the time, most thigns are jokes, even when not, it doesn't matter
._.
ilyninrap
nozty, indeed. with ponies.
Besides, if you see both Joomay and I using terrible spelling, we're joking around
/me sucks on Jmo's eyeball

Wat is a brain

TheRandomkid321, you're on the internet and taking things seriously?
gid <3
most norwegian net slang looks terrible in english
GID ASS
Internet i srs bsns.
is^
You can find some serious beans on the internet.
I'm going to ignore that comment Phase4.
Unless you're on medical forum or something.
MAH BEANS.
TheRandomkid321, 6_9
Phase4 has a point.
^
Like I always say, lighten up TheRandomkid321
TheRandomkid32: You take a lot of things WAY too seriously.
A very pointy point.
When someone tells you to lighten up, they aren't insulting you, so to speak
GOld_Demona I do take things seriously.
You're not gonna have fun with life in the future if you take everything seriously.
It's okay to be sensitive but learn when things aren't serrious.
You need to loosen up and enjoy life.
only things you must take seriously, is responsibilites and your job
^
^^
Job not so much.
Depends on the job
^
Very much so.
Vivix, depends on the job. what if you work as a... uh... clown :D
but you can be serious at work, and still throw rubber balls at your coworker
Death and taxes.
Hehe, you have to be SERIOUSLY FUNNY
It's hard to enjoy life when you know at the end of it you are going to be rotting away in a hole somewhere.
:>
Nah, we're all gonna die, but you have to have fun on the way there
alright I'm not hassling this.
11,02Night all :)
Night :>
nighty NewSuperBronyU|Zzz *huggiewubbie*
goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
TheRandomkid321: Dude, that's not something that's worth worrying about.
Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz ~
Nacht SB.
TheRandomkid321, with thast in mind, enjoy life
TheRandomkid321: It happens to literally everybody, so what's the point in letting it bother you?
Gold_Demona I'm going to ignore you calling me a Camels penis.
# Always look on the bright side of life #
/me whistles
.....What?
She didn't even acll you that?
Maybe dude means several things?
call*
Dat kick btw.
How did I get kicked?
something about colours
autokick from colour detection
I never ued colours. AT least not conciously.
U used colors without using colors.
he did?
TheRandomkid321: Where in the bloody blue hell did you get "camel's penis" in anything I said?
Gold_Demona Dude = Camels Penis
ROFL
xDDDD
late 19th century (denoting a dandy): probably from German dialect Dude 'fool'
lolwut .-.
TheRandomkid321: Yeah, and a dork is a whale's penis. Yer point?
apparently not
I've heard Elephant Ass hair, but that works.
You have to be joking around now, right? We can't take offense to duude
why would you use elephant ass hair
softer than dog fur
I TRY to be humourous and noone finds it funny. That's why I take things seriously.
and better for a wg
*wig
TheRandomkid321: The joke was really obscure.
And I mean REALLY obscure
^
yeah- we didn't get it
Shrug.
Gold_Demona Once again why I am serious. NOONE GETS MY BLOODY JOKES!
TheRandomkid321: There's a reason one of the rules of comedy is to know your audience
Hehehe
Gold_Demona speaks TRUUUUUTH.
its one joke, dont stress
[no object] (dude up)
dress up elaborately:
my brother was all duded up in silver and burgundy
I laughed, LOUDLY
In the freaking Oxford Dictionary
hehe. my mom would kill me if i would do that
Duded... up? :D
Sounds so silly
That just doesn't sound right.
XD
Bro, you duded up yet?
TheRandomkid321: There's a difference between being serious and taking things seriously.
Especially TOO seriously
browniestaet is srs bsns
addm pls
RibboneTheDuck
In the great words of Jaymoo
Not to mention seriousness is a rarity in this day of age. My sister (14) wears pants that are cut SO short you can see the pockets hanging out. THAT'S considered fasion. You go out in a tuxedo and you get laughed at probably.
^wat
^^ lolwut
depends on where you are with said tuxedo
Tuxedo is NOT casual wear though
you'd get laughed at in the 1800th century too
I love vests and pink bow ties \:3/
wait waht 19th century*

Ninjazz, totally worth it ^^
WOOOOOOORRTH IT.
Browniestate pls stahp being srs bsns.

I hear tuxedo's are incredibly uncomfortable.
depends how good they are
AdamTheDuck, I find bow ties , right adjusted, hilarious. have you seen ziny tim? :D
*tiny
but they're ... after 18:00 and only formal occations, wearing one elsewhere is "silly peasant" ish
I like bowties. Bowties aer cool.
are^
I know the two times I've seen my husband in a tux, he wasn't comfortable at all.
They ær cool Jmo
Invi, Tiny Tim... Where have I heard that before?
Jmo: You know what else is cool? Fezes
Oh yeah
Fezes are awesome
Fez, Bowtie and a monocle
And the sad thing is that even with the martyr kick, topic is still on srs mode.
you're the man of the hour
AdamTheDuck, Living in the sunshine, loving in the moonsgine ^^
*sunlight and moonlight
Invi, yes, I remember now :$
can't find the pic, but he had a giant bow tie ^^
Invi, hehe, I can imagine it :D
I want a fez.
I got a fedora :P
I want a tophat.
You can do carnac
All I have is a cabby hat.
I like hats, but I feel uncomfortable wearing them
Ninjazz, me too. i just have a straw hat :<
I'm still looking for a bowler hat though ;~;
A fedora. HAH GAAY
lol
Fedoras are EXPENSIVE
Invi, I got two of those. If you own a garden, it's pretty much mondatory.
hipster central here :P
I like Fedoras :<
ikr
d3rb, :P
Ninjazz, I have no garden
<---[Jigen fangirl]
Carrot top pls.
But what about Fezes?
;~;
Fezes are cool
a fez?
Fez, floral shirt, chest hair, and tight tight tight shorts, and you're from the 80s scaring girls away from the bar
and phat pants
Fezes are funny
but I prefer a turban over a fez ^^
Don't the masons wear fezes in their parade?
The Doctor rawks teh fez
^
I wouldn't want a turban. They look complicated.
yeah-
I kinda like hats with feathers in them
Gold_Demona, if you may wear one, you have enough money to have personal for that ^^
Invi: This is true
Can hire somebody to wrap your head for you. XD
i wonder how much that woulkd cost...
I think I'll go to bed now. Might as well face the fuckwits at school asap.
nighty TheRandomkid321

/me licks Lil_B

Malavolent, could been worse. Over all not so bad. Just fairly busy.
AdamTheDuck :3
Yo Lil_B
Ninjazz: School?
/me hugs AdamTheDuck Invi and Vivix :3
Ohai Lil_B.
/me proceeds to greet Lil_B with a friendly embracement.
Malavolent, sort of.
AdamTheDuck finally found a name :)
/me hugs Malavolent as well :)
Lil_B, yeah I was afk last time to ask you what it was :$
Then you left :P
/me shackes Ninjazz hand like a Sir
AdamTheDuck :P
Like a sir.~ http://fav.me/d59wade
AdamTheDuck anyway, my name shall be konsolN, I have used this name since for longer than Lil'B and it's the name of my youtube :3
AdamTheDuck and nobody has this name :)
Konsoln, interesting.
what a coincidence im downloading TF2 right now :)
And people will finally stop thinking you're a girl at first glance.
May I ask if it's German for something? :P
Lil_B, you thought he was a girl? :D
Funny, I Lil_B did sound like girl at fist, but internet logic dictates that everyone is a caucasian male of ages 18 to 30 :$
AdamTheDuck "Konsole" is a console , and "N" because Nintendo xD kind of an anagramm for Nintendo consoles
I though*
first*
Silly fillys there are no girls on the internet!
Thought**
... people thought I was a Girl at first? <.< I didn't even notice
Damnit, typo in my typo correction >.>
/me pats AdamTheDuck's back.
Liil_B i always thought you where a guy
hehe most people also trhought I was a girl ^^
I have no idea why.
well, noboidy ever askedc me if I was a GFirl or not, nether did anyone used "she" or "her" when reffering to me xD
But thankfully, I've only been confused as female ONCE. And I still don't have ANY idea how.
I'm a girl, but I think most of you know that by now. :P
I didn't know that
<.<
Is this like pony survival or something?
I typically assume everybody else in here's a guy unless they identify otherwise
You gots a hubby, Gold_Demona.
or like a jugggernaut mode?
U must be gurl.
Nah I thought you were guy Invi :D
the only Guy who I was confused was Gildash, but he kinda did it on purpose to confuse people xD
states*
Gold_Demona I tent to forget that , sry, just my lac of memory :/
Gold_Demona, kidding. I know that.
AdamTheDuck, ja ja ^^
HAH. GAAAAAAY
To my awareness, Florida is not one of them tho. :D
Jmo :D
God, that reminds me of this one image
What are your oppinions on gay marriage bronystate?
It's gay.
:>
I couldn't care less
no wai.
I had no clue.
I don't mind, as long as they keep to themselves it isn't hurting anyone.
And I'm thinking, "really man?" :D
Jmo if only most people were like that
I don't care so much about it. Live and let live. Or let die.
do whatever you want, don't hurt anybody, and don't rub it into anyones face, thats what I expect from every Fanbase, Ethnical group, and basicly everyone :/
^
If you're gonna bash it, then you better have a solid reason.
well said Lil_B
^
"But the bible says it's wrong!!!"
ZOMG
Lets not bash the bible either
do unto others what you want done unto you
Let's just bash Vivix instead.
:>
Yes, I looove it
WUT.
Maaassssochist.
yeah, the bible also says, you shouldn't eat for 1 week
hit me HARDER Jmo!
The Bible also says Jesus told everybody not to judge other people and just leave that to God.
WUUUT.
/me bashes Vivix
Gold_Demona, indeed
Gold_Demona exactly
To be critical though; I've met more angry atheists than religious people
i told yall id be back
Oh finally. People who aren't bashing the Bible and are quoting. You suprise me every day Browniestate.
Jmo, the bible could be actually an awesome action story, but when that jesus guy shows up, it gets boring ^^
Ohai again therainbowvortex
>.>
hehehe
Invi, lolwut XD
people don't understand the Bible >.< tecnicly the old Testament should be removed, because a lot of the Morals in there, were later revised by Jesus
I think the Norwegian church only hands out the new testament
I'm not sure
Invi: To me it got boring right after the Adam and Eve story when it started listing off this endless lineage that comes after Adam. Oh dear GOD, why are these people important?
Invi i know right??? Who would you rather worship some guy with a beard in clouds or a big ass firey kick ass red monster
I've never read it, actually
But it was my favourite class in school
Gold_Demona, that are just stories to entertain ^^
"TF is kill"
LOL
"no"
Game crashed :D
Ninjazz: i had people bivle bashing me most of my childhood
Listing off a bunch of people just to show how long the lineage is is not good writing imo. =/
/me sits on Gold_Demond
*clouds
Especially when said people listed are NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN
Ow Jmo! y u sit on me? D:
The scribes back than had a nasty way of doing that.
updoming?
LOL
people try to force riligion on me :|
therainbowvortex, depends on your company I guess.
LOL dat updoming
I'm not that haevy Dema >.>
heavy*
Biblebash means the opposite rainbowvortex
Jmo: I ish small and very fragile. :<
eqd pls. SPELL CHECK.
:<
Hi guys whats happenin?

Vivix: what?

MadSurge: MaryXJoseph is a good one too. :3
FAADGE.
/me cligns to Jmo
But!
Pfft
Neoism is best religion
Happy Hearth Warming everypony :)
Hearth's Warning Eve
Neoism is the belief that one day this asshole with sunglasses will come down and save us from the machines.
AdamxLil_B OTP

/me rolls around

We would teach love and tolerance and worship Celestia and Luna. :D
Wish I could put "Jedi" as my religion on the Australian census XD

Ah that's right, Einstein
Mordi is trondheim version of Yo mama
Einstein, really? Nice
What ideas are those?
" I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but world War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."
^ That made me think for days :$
Oh the things you reblog Dema.
coLinux uses svn
what is this i dont even
people still use svn?
(for those who dont get it, linux development is primaraly done in git because svn sucks)
Hehe
github
(git and svn are file versioning tools, so we can track changes easily)
Phase4: see previous question
SVN is popular in Gmod, that's about it
svn should stop existing
well- with gmod13 they wont use that for autoupdate anymore
Make someone RQ DWR
I love github
its overcomplicated and less powerfull than git
/me wub git
Nah
I've never tried GIT, but I've never done a project with other people either
Screw you den chav
:P
And I don't use JS libraries or anything-
I wanted to play with you, but fine then ;_;
it makes it so easy for people to look at your software and what you're doing with it
and it encourages open source
To to make PRogress!
Github is nice
(you can have as many public repos as you like, but you have to pay for private ones)
>retrocityrampage.exe
Yo Ninjazz, I found your ideal show :D http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/693cd8e763bbfc4dcdb6ba4d69fc9894.png
but Sourceforge- how are they doing?
When I'm done witih my draw room thing, I want it free for everyone somewhere- and github seems more like a in dev thing than sourceforge-
MadSurge, there is only the master race. ALSO, I DREAM. I DREAM OF THAT SHOW.
And I don't want a website of my own, since I will probably never do another project
I have my own website
but github is just easier
Ohahaha. There's a blue hat on the AjRarity.
You've got mail. :D
Ninjazz: No cupcakes, Rarity only, Carousel Boutique!
is it good for doing what sourceforge did though? Offering dl to people who aren't there to code?
sure
inspircd hosts all their stuff on github
wow wtb slot.
http://inspircd.github.com
Ah nice, hm
'cause yeah, that would probably be ideal then-
sourceforge seems like svn
I just want a simple site that shows a changelog, and source dl for peopel to put on their size
sourceforge uses svn, yes
MadSurge, Even a Library all about fashion.
people*
and site
jeez, spelling
Vivix: you can put that in your repo readme
Fersure, i meen they conceptually feel like svn
Yeah, but something like inspircd site looks good
"Download the latest version here: <direct link to latest version>"
not all that powerfull and overcomplicates what it does
Inspircd's site is more complex
which suits their needs
yeah-
but you can do it simply too
Fersure, half the time i find those pointing to source files instead of binarys
Yeah, I was wondering since I'd only seen the github sites for eh node and faye
Phase4: yeah
Neeerds
/me puts on huge glasses
Jmo pls
Jmo, we're all nerds here :P
I have three projects on github
It isn't obvious enough.
I'm new to --coding something properly for once, but I'm having fun, and can actually see the finish line
Here on browniestaet
one is ignored completely but the other two are developed
ah?
/me searches github on google
Vivix: what do you use?
*nix or windows?
TIME FOR Phase4! :D
windows, it's a pretty basic JS and Html5 eh..application (not sure what to call it)
ah
web app?
If you've ever used paintchat, and groaned at Java plugin and bugs all over, then basically I'm trying to make a noplugin version of that
sounds interesting
Finally
yeah, for people to just have on their site
God damn.
what do you use editor wise?
NPP
back in my windows days I always used note-
yeah
I use vim now.
xD
Aah, I've only ever really used NPP
vim is sexy.
ebcause, I rarely code, so whenever I do- I relearn
you can run it on windows I guess
using cygwin or something
I've never tried it myself-
/me googles
hm- the only thing I miss in NPP are things like- looking up function definition with rigth click and such
oh well I don't use any graphical version of vim
well someones got alotta mail
dat mailbox
Ahh, commandline? (forgot linux name..shell?)
Just realized you may have heard my voice
forget what I sound like.
I haven't used linux for so long that most of terms and methods are gone
Gold_Demona: Derpy is best background pony :3
i can never forget DashWithRainbows
MadSurge, lies, Applejack is best background pony.
AdamTheDuck: that's one terible joke and you knoe it :|
Vivix: virtual machines are great for that
MadSurge, that's why she needs more episodes :/
AdamTheDuck: yep
^ x10000
The joke wasn't meant to be cruel
Fersure, yeah, I might start dabbling in it again, but I'm not sure what I would use it for
Vivix: I use it as my main OS
Yeah, I wouldn't mind, but all my software is mostly windows only
really I don't know what I would use windows for these days
lol
Animate, Cubase, sai- etc
I like Linux, but yeah, I don't really have anywhere to have it at the moment
maybe put it on the laptop some day
MadSurge, AdamTheDuck, funnily enough, she had the most screen time in S1.
in a virtual machine...
lol
mmaybe- I like having it running on its own
Ninjazz: let's hope for Season 3 then :)
Low hopes.
why coulnt i jump :(*
Hello everypony
Ninjazz: also, http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7ce66a404613faf0582f33aa10528b53.jpg Rarity looks fabulous EVEN IN THAT STYLE!
Ahaha phase
hey DoctoDoctorWho
Cubismmm
hi DoctoDoctorWho
what was it called
MadSurge, her mane looks goooooooood.
And daawww Pinkie.
better than any modern art ive seen
/me has been to many a modern art galery
/me has liked a lot of it
pot80: well, Picasso was a great artist, even if he was a dick.
One of the installations was an ATM, and a scarily realistic baby forgotten next to it
I never liked Picasso-
MadSurge: what did he do?
I basically liked 16-1900 and 1990-2012
/me went to tate modern and saw piece of paper stuck to wall valued at £20,000
I never look at the values, they're--crazy
Most moder nart installations aren't made to be bought though
I love moder nart
installation vs paintings
DoctoDoctorWho: he never lent any money to his family, who in turn had to rever him as an absolute genius :|
huh
Just saying that I don't like THAT kind of modern art
pot80: those are terrible, I agree.
yeah
afternoon everyone
I did see a bunch of random colour splotches called Untitled 1~5 valued at about 800 dollars each
hello ShyBetaFemale
how are things ShyBetaFemale
pot80: stuff like Picasso and Dali' though are great
hello ShyBetaFemale

Oh phase
sleep is for the weak
i woke up at 13:30
Phase4: Later.
Phase4, sleep is for the weak :<
MadSurge: yeah but thats not the 'modern' modern art
Hello ShyBetaFemale

Jmo can attest to that <,<
ShyBetaFemale: are you talking military time?

AdamTheDuck, and those with uni in the morning
Hm?

I once stayed up for 72 hours straight playing gears 3, the only downside was that I fell asleep during a brumak attack.
that's gross dude i'm sorry hahaha
72 hours....
3 days
jesus how is that possible
When I was a teenager, I could do that ish
but not anymore

I'd sleep 3 hours a night for months
23
that's not a teenager anymore?
huh
well i'm only 20 anyways so
go to bed at 3-4, get up around 6:30
teenager stops at 19

Dat POV of yours is clouded Who

How are you making the world a better place?
By ridding it of corrupt leaders and uniting it under one banner. We got this far seperated, imagine our potential united!
/me backs away slowly
hello anybody home?
I only look bad cuz everyone who has tried so far were evil madmen
/me pounces on pot80
Nope. Nobody home
But we already rule the world :D we have men and women in every government now :D

Gold_Demona: do you go out with your hubby saturday nights?

G1-Meh at best. G2-Daphuq is this? G3-*traumatised* I-i-i, dont wanna talk about it.
MadSurge: note it said ANIME convention
Bronysith: :D
DoctoDoctorWho: not to mention g3.5

Dark92Enigma if they want someone to get them over in india why not sign sonjay dujj
dutt
alexxm: Remember they had Muhhamad Hassan........but they failed, and then came Khali
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
yeah but hassan was over he only got fired because of the terrorist segment Dark92Enigma
Gragh. Inactive fish slap. ;A;
why trout... why not cod or summing?
Why not?
^
/me picks up fish fingers
alexxm: yes.....And for one time Khali got over.....until he got the World Heavyweight championship
You know what, It's almost midnight.

Thanks, DoctoDoctorWho
Kandarihu: no prob,
alexxm, well I have no interest in something like that.
/me dissapears into pure shadow
Kandarihu: that ''ass cream'' is a WWE reference from 2002
Kandarihu: it's not really ''ass cream'' but rather used for comedic effect
Can't you see how sharp this knife is? http://youtu.be/sKZh70prVt8
What amazing knife
anyone want some chocolate ass cream lol austen powers
Hmm, I remember when I watched WWE.
Kandarihu, I remember when I watched WWF
Maybe it wasn't during that time. And not during a 7 year interval of that time.
http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/post/33408659405/what-japan-thinks-of-mlp120-with-timestamps
Oh, never mind. That's right. I never watched WWE, just WCW
Ah, I'm always interested in the Japanese perspective.

11,01Wish I would hear back from the recruiter in Charlotte, NC.
OOOH spiderman 1
11,01Please don't smiley spam FlutterMEDIC.
i prefer the new one
Nittany_Discord: you mean you have a military background? :O
i like this spiderman
i slept at 11th in the evening woke up in 8 am
either way, i'm excited about getting Assassin's Creed 3 from preorder.
SPIDERMAN 1 YAAAAAAAAAAY
11,01Some of my family has been there. My stepfather was Navy. My uncle is in the Marines.
This movie brought comic book movies back to life
Can't wait until 22nd, that's when the TF2 Halloween special's supposed to happen :)
Nittany_Discord: i have 4 cousins in the marines and 3 in the SEALs
DUCKTALES WOO WHOO
Bronysith: nice
Nittany_Discord: speaking of exercise, I went back to swimming! It's tiresome but satisfying :$
........And it took 8 years to make them serious (insert The Dark Knight) thank you!
William DA FOE!
FlutterMEDIC: yup, many family members going out to die for this country, cant say i agree but i appreciate what they do
11,01I'm running every day. Do about a 1/2 mile before breakfast. I'm running farther each day.
Dark92Enigma: the first Batman movie was FUCKING AWESOME anyways
FlutterMEDIC: of course!
Nittany_Discord: but you are doing airforce right?
11,01Yeah.
Nittany_Discord: no wait, you get to be a pilot for an EVA dont you?
11,01And they have fitness requirements.
DONT LIE TO ME
11,01Bronysith: No.
Bronysith: who lied?
Well, even pilots must be fit and healthy, right?
Nittany_Discord: yes, you are so being a pilot for an EVA
SPIDERS
Bronysith: oh.....you were talking to Nittany_Discord
PUNCH 'EM
SPiiiiiiideeeeeeerssssssss
11,01EVA pilot have to be kids with emotional problems.
hai Nitanny
Nittany_Discord: what are the requirements for the Air Force PRT (Physical Readiness Test, if it's called something different for Air Force)
all soldiers, regardless of branch, must be physically fit
Nittany_Discord: and you are neither of them :D
Nittany_Discord: then that means you get to pilot a Gunman
1314 with emotional issues?
13i missed out :<
wasnt Asuka like 16 in the anime?
idk, the way she went was disturbing
BULLSHIT
>One's missing
>Nopony gives a toss
that teacher is so sinister
>don't give two shits about it
Bronysith: Yeah, that part was pretty nasty
Gold_Demona: but then she comes back to life and escapes the sea of Tang
Shizuka: i had them......
11,01According to the OTS website, for my age, 39in waist, 33 push-ups, 42 sit-ups, and I have to do a 1.5-mile run in 13:36.
i mean LCL fluid
Tour leader has to remain calm and report it later, not freak out in front of the guests
IRL this would just be like Madagascar
why does nobody care one of the experimental spiders is missing
Bronysith: Mmm tang.
SHUT
DOWN
EVERYTHING
Bronysith: Everyone turned into tang except Asuka and Shinji.
num
11,01But since I'll probably be 30 before I go, I only need to do 27 push-ups 39 sit-ups, and a 1.5-mile run in 14 mins.
Nittany_Discord, it's not about having emotional problems. They just have to be among the kids who were concieved during the 1st impact.
alexxm the same reason the witch didn't tell dorothy that she could use her slippers to get back home......some people are dicks......
Gold_Demona: no they were tang, but left the sea of tang due to sheer willpower alone
Bronysith: Wasn't that during instrumentality tho?
Dark92Enigma: much like extreme catholics
what's going on in stream? lawl
Weeeeeeeee
HavokOC: first Spiderman movie
yah, but i hear commentary
or something
HavokOC: Rifftrax
Oh yeah, i remember William DaFoe was in this one
Gold_Demona: when everyone was turning into delicious tang, that point EVERYONE including shinji and asuka were tang, but left the sea due to their sheer willpower
Why's Lex Luthor there?
Oh, okay
HavokOC: Rifftrax AKA MST3K

It's a miracle, he doesn't need glasses!

How did she not see that.
Good thanks, yourself Fluffy?

So, I looked I looked up Topper

Shizuka: Why does Bruce Campbell has little to no SCREEN TIME
Shizuka: he was more recurrent in the old timey Spiderman comics
Emil, Big Mac is not somepony who tries to top a story he's been told with a better one
He's too high level.
He's not gonna get any EXP.

Exactly, :)
Moore-Bacon: BEST. NAME. EVER.
EHH?
...
13yeah when you go EHH at someone
we did not need an explanation for this
13and they fly back 30 feet
Shizuka: he slided further than Fluttershy on ''Swarm of the Century''
Shizuka Peter gets AoE bonus or something
13you know... other than the obvious construction of that shot
13shouldn't he be using his whole palm to support his weight?
gross
DON'T LOOK DOWN?
First thing you do when you get awesome superpowers?

Dark92Enigma: Oh, I see.
Bronysith: AGH THAT FACE D:
StinkomanFan: you couldn't tell it before?

Kurra: Normally, a kind of gel-ish thing comes out as a result of bacteria being pushed away.
FOR ME TO POOP ON
Also I had dreams about surreal things emanating from my palm
HERE IT COMES......

Imagine his parents coming in and seeing that white-ish gelly everywhere.

BONESAW HAS EQUIPPED: NESSIE'S NINE IRON
Emil: its in the script
I heard bad stuff about the new Spiderman movie, is it true?
Bronysith: Oh course it it.

I guess he has to learn how to USE the spider sense.
That makes sense.

Everlasting_Joy: he said "i dont know who he is, he just sends it in the mail" but he knows peter parker was the one who brings in the pics, he was protecting him
Bronysith: JJJ is a jerk, but not evil.
J. Jonah Jameson is.. dammit MadSurge
That's why I like him :D

13so let's get this straight... spiderman travels above traffic using webs, leaves BEFORE goblin... and yet dafoe has time to get out of the burning building undetected, change into his suit, and STILL ARRIVES BEFORE SPIDERMAN
i like twiluna
People have TERRIBLE peripheral vision in movies
Shizuka: maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagic
The ceiling is bleeding! D:
ceiling NOOOOOOO
13that and why would dafoe immediately suspect spiderman is there
THE CEILING IS HAVING ITS PERIOD!
Shizuka: Simple, he got there through the power of money
13and how did peter change into HIS suit so fast
hello
"Hey everyone!" :D
Spiderman stashes extra suits all around NY in case of room invader emergencies

GREY'S HOSPITAL FOR CROSSDRESSERS :D
13see if you want to be a superhero, you need to be ultra paranoid BEFORE you get your powers
first ever sonic rainboom
13that way it doesn't draw suspicion that no one knows anything about you or your secret identity
I want turkey, corn, potatos, pop and all that other good stuff that goes with Thanksgiving.
13and on the plus side you can tell your friends and they know not to say anything
Everlasting_Joy: pop?
Bronysith: Minnesotan for soda.
13^
BTW: Looks like 36km jump will succeed today.
Shizuka: and even when your crush is living NEXT. DOOR.!
13tbf it's pop in central illinois too
any one watches stratos? the jump from 120.000ft?
;D
applejack`: nope
applejack`: I am and Ryunosuke is
applejack`: yeah, a YT stream
Shizuka: lies. http://derpy.me/AyCsV
alexxm did you see the bit with MACHO MAN.....i left crying with nostalgia
i did Dark92Enigma
JUST when i had to help my dad
Or a next-door-crush
Does EVERY Superhero live in New York or some equivilent to it?

Shizuka: Violet is in high school.
Oh hai ex-boyfriend
My god, he's holding her hand. THE FIEND
13still you get my point, just so much dead parents for superheroes, it's laaazy
Because men and women NEVER hold hands unless they're together!
IMP
applejack`: what is it, since i don't have the plugin.
Shizuka: just after Disney turned dead parents as a comic fad
applejack`: there's also direct stream http://www.redbullstratos.com/live/
StinkomanFan: not all superheroes live new york http://mexadas.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/capitan-mexico-mexada1.jpg

Bronysith: do you have that pic with Twilight Sparkle's dress?
brb
metric system is best system
^
thats alot of chipmunk voice
So quiet here today, though.
Old exposition is best exposition
cachi01: /)
I'm serious, the way we measure things is WAY more confusing. I'm always having to look at conversion charts for everything. >_>
I wonder what Captain Germany would be like
SirGanjalf: (\
I'm back again.........anypony noticed the dialogue in this movie is cheesy?
Dark92Enigma: yep
StinkomanFan: http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/193036-90868-hauptmann-deutschlan_super.jpg
Dark92Enigma: Nah, seems pretty natural for me<_<
Oh, noes......we have to save her for the SECOND TIME!
Aaaaaaand minor plothole: wouldn't that conversation be recorded on the answering machine, thus she could figure out who he is just by listening to it?
Dark92Enigma was it meant to be cheesy
imperial system isn't excessively crazy. most of our units can be divided evenly by 2, 3, AND 4
Dark92Enigma: What gave you that impresion :P
cachi01: OH YESH
HOLY SHIT, CAPTAIN GERMANY LOOKS LIKE A MONSTER
Explodium strikes again
^
alexxm Obsidian since it's based on the comic..........
Good god, it's STILL exploding?
Dark92Enigma: I know I was just being sarcastic
/me Do you accept my offer? Are You In or Out?
This scene is what Micheal Bay watches behind closed doors
....um. Now I'm no scientist but i'm pretty sure no matter how strong he is, what he's doing would severely strain his glider and would damage his body.
-54C is very very cold :p
/me You're the one who's out, Gobby........OUT OF YOUR MIND!!!!!!!!
der be Boy Scouts in that tram
"Let the girl go!"
DAT DIALOGUE :D
SCOUT ISH SPY
OFF TO SAVE HER FOR THE SECOND TIME
Silly CriticKitten, logic has no place in a superhero movie
why do they always have to say let the girl go?
AAAAAAH
CASTLE AAAAAGH
say AAAAAAAAAH
Aaah!
AAAAAAAAAAAAH
My god, who would have thought that he could just swing under the bridge and grab them both? NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT.
aaaaaaagh
AAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAGH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
:S
god Monty Python is awesome
CriticKitten: since it's based on the 60's comic, there was no place for logic
REEEECOLAAAAAAA
cachi01: No no, back of the throat, "aaugh."
FlutterMEDIC: /)
The Sixties were weird.
Colt_Brovakiin: (\
Aaaaand she'd be dead

Good Guy Citizens of New York... wait what

cachi01: dat masturbating spiderman
Random people on the street do more than Mary Jane
Spectrum_Rush: I thought the same.
YESH
MadSurge: I know, that's why the comic does this scene so much better. >_>
DerpyMuffins: random junk on the road? :D
Obsidian just a heads-up of how useless she was
AT THE TIME
"My face! My beautiful face!"
Exactly
They only helped Spidey because they got to pelt some fruit with other fruit
Doncha know, that misery loves company.~

dabi <3
what ft is he jumping?
and controlling the balloon before release
~120K feet I think
hes gon do sonic boom
bonjour
Ohai jaymoo <3
JUMP IT
:3
pot80, sonic rainboom :)
back
those of you that have Discovery Channel can watch the jump there as well
Discovery Channel is about a minute ahead of the youtube stream
Ryunosuke: he doesnt have any colour so i dont think he would do a rainboom
shh
:)
Ryunosuke: he'd have to go up with a bucket of water for that XD
its the redbull :)
wouldnt he fall at the same speed earth turns away from him at that point?
hey, who remembers what the A movie winner was yesterday?
Kung Fu Hustle
RAWRity kung fu hustle
ah
oGriofa - that would imply that his horizontal movement is the same as the earth's spin
and I remember there was some contention over Colour of Magic, since it's like 3 hours long
he's barely moving more than 20mph in any given direction
how long is it untill jump
?
15-20 minutes i think
http://www.redbullstratos.com/live/
MirrorImage: Thats how orbit works silly.
he's at 96k ft
little over
oGriofa - yes, but the earth spins at several hundred miles per hour
20mph is hardly enough for orbit
8mph
howdy everypony how are y'all
Hello everypony, how are your days going?

Hi PeachStreak|waking :)
i wonder what is going gonna hapen when he falls
how are things Silver_Soother
morning Silver_soother
heyah PeachStreak|waking and Silver_Soother
15 mins to jump
Michael, he falls
yeah, i know
Things are doing pretty good alexxm
120k ft elevation - is that the limit between landing back on earth & floating off into space?
16mph
>Second Highest
WAT
but what temperature is gonna reack?
It must be scary to look down at the ground you know and see nothing but darkness and one tiny sphere.
reach*
Michael, he has heat plates
MirrorImage: You fall at terminal velocity pretty fast to, look it up, it has somthing to do with the way earths gravity is, things in orbit are in free fall towards the center if the earth but earth turns away at the same speed that that point, iniciating orbit.
98000 ft
11,01It is a fun fact that if he goes straight up, the earth will rotate under him.
wuuuut?
30km
hes going west
sooo hell end up somewhere like in china then?
winds
pot80 - given enough time, possibly
11,01He's in the stratosphere if it's warming.
30mph
Nittany_Discord: I swear that if he falls down and ends up knocking down a tiny peg like a pendulum, I'm done.
oGriofa: i'm learning about that in physics
anyways, http://i.imgur.com/yaq7A.gif
i do wonder what that big red button on the OUTSIDE of the capsule is for
where is he going to land?
27-28 mph west
100,000 feet, whoo!
its over 100,000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
100k feet
nerf_solider: Am i right then? I think so, I learned about it about 3 years ago so my knowledge is rusty.

best example I heard of earths rotation was "you could hover off the ground in a helicopter and watch the ground move under you" !1th grade astronomy teacher
Somewhere around Roswell, New Mexico.
11th*
Cypresswolf: well, not WATCH so much as realize it
20mph
since it's too slow for us to actually see it moving. Instead we just eventually realize "Oh, hey, that rock's like 20 feet away now."
wow

I'd be like watching paint dry - Earth rotating so slowly - like watching shadows strech accross the ground

that ping web pages to each side of the screen thing is actually quite usefull
:O imagine if we had no ocean - sky dive from the edge of space to the bottom of the Marianas Trench - That's be awesome
nerf_soldier: nice game u have there
Nittany, I just dont know what time it is for him there >.<
Cypresswolf: Haha that would be amazing!
Panda|Drawing: 18:22

MadSurge: You say that as though Scotland isn't apart of Britain. :p

GilDash: well, I'm talking about regions :D
cachi01 http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MrIxH6DToXQ
In most, where breathing is recommended, it's blue.
Ninjazz - last i knew, breathing was recommended everywhere
Oh i had that, open. Nothing was happening....lol
Ninjazz! I lost sight of you :D
MadSurge: That would be Scotland and England then, not Scotland and Britain. :p
MadSurge, been /real/ quiet. >_>
Until a certain fisherman hit with a trout.
Ninjazz: Yes you have. ^_^
Ninjazz: happens to me too.

Oooooohai GilDash.
00,10ok guys refresh for Space jump
If you go here you get a little instrument/stat display: http://www.redbullstratos.com/live/ but beyond that it's the youtube stream.
I see how it is.
MirrorImage: Except in space. And underwater. And in carbon monoxide.

Hello everypony
maybe I had a reason
Maybe I didn't
MirrorImage: Well I wouldn't recommend that somebody breathe when there's tear gas in the air!
oh cool, new stream program
the baloon is still rising?
I'll never know. Never understand either. :/
what ballon is this this"
:>
what canera are they useing to film this shot? another balloon going up with him or somthing?
But hearing "IIIIDEEEAAAA" after like... 2 hours of not saying a word kinda surprised me.
camera*
oh Shizuka http://derpiboo.ru/122615
oh I didnt know they were comentating on it XD
Tailsy: Yeah, still going up from 108,000 ft.
Ninjazz: Oh, you know your pony ep got picked for next week, right? :)
Lawl
Oh God, his face is too hot!
13Spectrum_Rush: we're doomed
GilDash, I heard Wjat
so doomed
Enter key you bastard.
so is he going to die
00,10soooooo how do they abort?
Spectrum_Rush: make it happen
Sumica - same way they don't abort
"WEEEEEEEE"
arbort
fire a spaceshuttle after him
are they showing this on tv?
00,10hehehe
13so what's wrong?
Sumica: Lots of praying.
Ninjazz: Defenestrate the enter key!
Sumica, I would assume just drop the pod
GilDash, I heard. What's funny is that I don't even remember since my first choice apparently got removed.*
00,10stick his hand out the window with a bb gun
alexxm: I dont think it would be live if he was definately going to die XD
11,01I bet they drop the capsule and then let it parachute to the ground.
we meet again 240p
I need it for now. It shall stay out of necesity.
sumica, I hope his jump clone is up to date :)
So.... When's he gonna jump?
ok pot80
00,10120k feet
Ninjazz: I don't even enter the lottery. So, yeah. :D
StinkomanFan - somewhere around 125k feet
when the balloon stops
36km
dat audio fix
Well the planned jump hieght is around 120K, he's at 110K at the moment, so not that much longer?
thats only 2 k left
oh u murricans and your imperial system
oh wait
Ouroboros - he's ascending at about 1k ft/m, so 10-15 minutes probably
Geez dat balloon goin way up 6_9
like 10 more mins if not less
They said something about the vizor being screwy, will they stop if that gets worse?
Hallo everypony
Thanks MirrorImage.
hi Bromany :)
Silver_Soother - little hard to "stop" at this point
GilDash, your call. I suspect neither does a lot of the regs here. Tbh, good thing. Helped me get a chance.
hai Bromany
00,10they should have used a rocket
Hi Bromany :)
13so what's wrong?
i gotta go guise, ill be back, peace.
hey Bromany how arfe
cya oGriofa
his visor is warm....
13oh
oops
11,01Should have used a jetpack.
To the edge of space!
MirrorImage: I suppse you're right....
Shizuka - he's got a windshield defroster for his visor like you'd have on your rear car window
00,10faceplate is not warming up
:)
except it's not working
spaaace
Ninjazz: Ah, but how do you know I wouldn't pick the same episode as you? That would increase the chances of that episode being shown.
Uh oh....
o not hot enough?
One small step for man, one....scary as shit leap for that poor man in the balloon.
The visor has a demister/deicer built into it, tiny wires running though it to stop it icing up.
They should have brought an extra suit. -.-
But they're not working.
his face is gonna frezze off....
that's a lie
he's playign space invaders
just past 34km
*playing
they just want to make shit intense
i bet hes wishing he brought a gameboy...
One small step for man... then a hell of alot of falling for man XDD
i bet he has a pinkie pie in his pockey
pocket+
GilDash, I don't. But there's the thing about having YOUR choice picked. Even though around 20 other people could have picked the same one, it doesn't have the same effect of having your own named called out with the responsi-wow I should shut up.
what height did he want to reach before he jumps ?
noooo buffer
Bromany - about 120 thousand feet
36km/120ft
Ninjazz: I can some my response up in one simple word. You ready for it? Meh. XD
*120 k ft
Saw it coming.
/me sits on Ninjazz

NOW back to killing things.
11,01I guess space radiation levels are good as well.
almost 120k
I'm terrible lumbar support, jaymoo.
Ah well
they passed
aaaaaaaaaaand NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWW RECOOOOOOOOOOOOORD!!!!!!
GilDash: who's your favorite pony again?
read that with the mario party announcer voice
We must thank this balloon for its hard work and determination to float all the way up there. God bless you Balloon.
yay record :)
To the infinity and beyond!
Whoo!
00,10he's still well withen the protection area of earth magnetic feeld nitt

MadSurge: She would approve of what Felix here is about to do. :D
Now just the tricky bit to go.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GAKOLOnfV4 music for the jump
Nittany_Discord - his suit and the pod are good for that i'd imagine
pikorar - is that Ride of the Valkries?
00,10UV yes, but not solar radiation
hi pepople!

so they're waiting til he hits 120k?
space jump
00,10yeah RAWRity
11,01About 22 miles.
man, that guy must have taken a LOT of Red Bull to be doing this.
Like, he's gonna need a lot of fucking wings.
RAWRity - he's got a life time supply of the stuff at this point i'd imagine
Austrian
00,10he's gonna unzip and take a leak when he steps out RAWRity
oh, that's a great idea for another record RAWRity - highest wing suit jump
if only he road a dirt bike on his way down THEN it would be rely cool
so this goes up several kilometers and jump out? umm, for what?
No, this piece is perfect: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gqT6En2O78 :P

they have trackers

xD
Sumica: Kermin
inb4 its raining men

And a 25% chance of someone sueing them. I see. :P
The arkward moment when he realises he forgot his parachute
yep
Sumica: they always look bored
they be waiting for over 2 hours, and going through checklists, ofc its boring :)
oh boy

at least "speed of sound" at 30 seconds
set phasers to HUG!

i wonder if he droped a penny would it kill some1....
whether that's sonic boom speed at this level, i don't know

he's depressurizing the cabin now
Hai XylemTube
Dark_Horst: Oh I don't know about these things.
StinkomanFan: Are you asking for a challenge?
the livestream has at least 20 seconds delay, they will shut if down is something terrible happens

pam
MirrorImage I'm aware that the youtube stream is delayed more, I myself am watching on another site. That's why I said at least
now watch the rest of that pressure drop off, SO EXCITING *squee*
damn internet froze again
Silver_Soother: And the people on Discovery Channel will still get to see the bloody carange if they're ahead of the stream
00,10no shit, like we did't know that

J_E_Smith71: Lucky bastards.... :P
It's so cold out there, that the stream is freezing.
I just want a boxing glove on a spring to kick him out...
and then sssssilence, oh wwait i spoke too soon.
Imagine hearing that "Ssssssssssssssssssssss" in the cabin and the very first thing you think is "OH SHIT CREEPER!"
Virtual Vaccuum?

Sumica: he's secretly Darth Vader
Nittany_Discord: Also, I don't know how much of your goal involves actually losing weight, but allow me to suggest watching what you eat. Not super dieting, but like... 1800 cal/day instead of 2000. It's much easier to control what you eat daily than force yourself to exercise daily
how are things Sonny

my OC nows that feel bro

You guys watching red bull stratos?

Nittany_Discord, I had to go to a dietition because i also had issues loosing wieght and have tried numerous diets >.>
Redbull is expensive as fuck.
11,01Just not snacking.
Nittany_Discord: GilDash is right to a point. Again, 1800 vs 2000 calories. Pushing it down to 1200 will probably hurt, 1500 might be doable.
"We can't find you." Very reassuring
HavokOC: yep
wow
I thought he was going to die
why didnt he have an on board camera :(
11,01I'll do 1800 or 2000 to be safe.
Red Bull could afford this?

00,10no he did't make it he payed for it but science made it
excellent
Sumica: poor soul, he never stood a chance against Tom's weight.
hi
00,10toms weight is noting compared to garrys girth
now he would have to accelerate quite a bit... but im thinking he did it. barely at that
Those 4 minutes passed pretty fast for me, but imagine how long it must've felt to HIM.
XD
so... bets on how many Rainbow Dash in a Flight Suit pics will be in the next 2 Drawfriends?

Sumica: da fak r u talin bout

The day we broke youtube :D
Sceince killed youtube.

^^
dari had he achieved 325 m/s at 20000 ft he would have broken the sound barrier by 10m/s
00,10you need air for sound
^^^^
Youtube is down? Still got it for me.
...I wonder though if YouTube's not working if the press conference will still run even if we have the embed on here
I NEEDS MY YOUTUBE
Too many people watching Kerbal man. :P

Derpy save us!
WRONG. you need a MEDIUM for sound :p
"502. That’s an error."
LOLOL
so Dark92Enigma who do you think is the worst wrestler currently with the wwe

Would somepony mind pinging me when the conference starts? I'm going to mute the stream and do some voiceover work.
and Youtbe back

11,02Wouldn't terminal velocity prevent him from ever reaching the speed of sound anyway?
I can break the sound barrier in 0g
NewSuperBronyU: Barely any air up at that altitude
dat db
sound barrier killed the Youtube
He had to have an oxygen tank
They counted down the minutes left of his oxygen.
00,10Terminal velocy varrys based on air presure
is youtube down for anyone else
NewSuperBronyU: I NEEDS MY YOUTUBY
Im like 95 percent sure he broke the sound barrier
ello everpony
good evening
eeyup, YT

Yeah, but not at sea level.
Which is best level.
00,10Youtube works fine for me
PeachStreak|LAPP: aaaand through her head :D

I'll show them how to get shit done.
Oh I bet you will

First, you need more fucking rockets, then some explosions, and finally, lasers, LOTS OF LASERS.
if you multiply Gary's girth by gravity at sea level, you proove that Gary Oak can achieve mach 7 by falling 2 inches
YouTube just came back up
Is this that daredavil thats jumping from space
youtube servers probley took a dump
until now
Now, this means that Gary Oak is likely made of dark matter
which explains ALOT

J_E_Smith71: Ikr?

clensing with fire
00,10they just recently replaced all the streat lamps in my area with LED ones, i hate it.
Raspberry, i know for a fact something that tasty cant be made in a factory. so dont lie to me.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_8n2Qgguto
:O
lol
Sumica: that must be one ugly street at night
00,10in this segment the budda is SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Lyra`: Oh my........
I wonder if you can make the Fluoreszene saty longer by somehow reducing the energy that's wasted in the Relaxion...
hello everypony......
hence why flourescent lamps cannot be just "thrown away"
Hi, everyone. :)
11,02They add mercury into bubble gum?!
its the mercury
Sumica: but that led would make them brighter and easier to see the ground, unless thats why you no like them
/me 08,01surreptitiously puts a party hat on Nittany_Discord as he's hugged
hello flutterchu :)
13yeah there's a test strip on 94 in st paul where they're putting in led lamps
Hi, flutterchu. :)

Hiya AJIsAwesome :)
11,01Yay! Party1
hiya flutterchu
11,01!
AJIsAwesome! :$
Hi flutterchu :)
13it's very harsh light compared to the orange sodium bulbs everyone's used to
00,10cause led street lights are stupedly bright
08,01i ate SO MUCH CAKE today

MadSurge! :$
00,10also I can see the flicker to LED lights
13yep
Hi Lil_B :)
08,01I WANT ONE OF THOSE WHEELS
LED is cold and dishartening, so companies will probably start tinting them
00,10just not if I look right at them
11,02How it's made: Ferris Wheels?
13can't think of any intersections around here still using solid bulbs
hai Lil_B
flutterchu: I think you need to get that checked out, I don't think puking on someone when you see them is healthy...
hey Michael|FF7 ! :)
Sumica: your not supposed to look directly at light silly
11,01There's a mix here though most have gone over to LED.
lets watch another!
11,01I guess to save power.
how it's made: babies........oh wait thats called porn right?
13how many seasons is how it's made up to, i saw 11 on youtube
Silver_Soother: okay ill stop that RP
yay now i can make lights

How it's made: Wood?

00,10one plus side to led trafic lights, birds tend to not try and nest in them any more
Raspberry is my favourite fruit :3
Oh my....

Pony's are great, Beer is good, & people are crazy
13BEER
screw beer
00,10yep
i like mead.
horrible stuff
Well, I haven't had any alcohol since I was about 12
11,01I don't drink alcohol regularly. Don't want to drink and drive.
I like trains.
mead is good
CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT
00,10figured you would start that song Shizuka
/me sings nord mead
Chrysalis: screw beer we have cider
i don't really like beer
cider is also good
13which, beer is good or the other one, cause i dunno where the other one is from
I'd facepalm
Cameh_Dude: dat nord mead
PeachStreak|Drawing: I'll raise my cider mug to that.
13just had a world of warcraft video of it from years ago
00,10aye that's the one Shizuka
I don't drink :| never found any alcohol that tasted good for me
Silver_Soother: same here
mead is made of Honey, nothing manlier than a drink made from honey, almost as manly as floral dresses and tea parties.
I prefer cider to be honest
Shizuka: I love that vid :D
well, i don't like regular beer from big breweries either.
I'd probably be a good designated driver, if I drove.
Did you know, the brewery that Jack Daniels is made is located in a dry county? They cant sell locally, but can everywhere else - sucks to live next door to it
11,01Those testers must have an awesome job.
Beer, the first ever ever thing which producing process was regulated by Law... of course... in Bavaria, Germany xD
Yes, we need to taste test the product...
>_>
<_<
I don't like Alcohol in generall
Absinth
I really like to drink beer, but no altbier *bleh*
Nittany_Discord, only when it's done right.

im old enough to drink but I have no ID to prove it.
and the only foreign beer till now i find appetising is heineken
those hops look a bit like rabbit feed
i stopped drinking all together. but when i still did, i always only drank what i liked. so never beer
Dem Flags Outside
PeachStreak|Drawing nice! :D
Uh, you should hope that control system has some sort of countermeasures for the EMP.
ewww... macro brews are gross. Anypony that likes Cooers light just doesnt have taste
^
I'd probably get fired from being a taste tester for a brewery - you're supposed to sip, evaluate taste, and spit it out - I'd invibe quite a bit
00,10test all the products dari
00,10......used bottles
inbibe
11,01Recycling, Sumica.
Lol
13makes sense, no point crushing and rebuilding bottles if you can just sterilize what you have
Sam Adams is were its at.
Lets bumb our M ugs Together! d] [b ... well... with a little bit of fantasy :/
00,10usealy recycleing invloces remaking from processed scrapps not whole products

The only beer I drink is root beer. So Lil_B [b
Lil_B: c[]*[]) i dont have a backwards c :'(
13alcohol doesn't really appeal to me, the scent of beer makes me go bleh
I really really like Root Bear actually
^
PeachStreak|Drawing: i think it was a d for that reason
Kandarihu: whats your RB? Mug, IBC, other?
I LOVE Root Beer.
00,10I like Ice wine and that's about it
Hey guys

PeachStreak|Drawing: b*
13course both my parents had alcoholic fathers so we pretty much never have alcohol around
Shizuka: same.
Eli: ok

sup pony_773
Cypresswolf, whatever I feel like picking up at Wal-Mart.
how come most of drinks that are steriotypically male all taste horrible
I'm more of a Barq's kind of guy in terms of root beer.
13SO MUCH CLOGGING
I've been drinking far too many spirits than I thought I would.
OPPA DERPY STYLE, HELLO EVERYPONY ! <3

Two weeks ago, it ws MUG. Last week, I got Barqs. But I don't always go for Root Beer. I got Cheerwine this time.

Sumica: WHAT?
So how do you think i should troll him
08,01ekips: this requires me actually going over to the thing and doing that
Eli unfortunatly yes
08,01which means i need to drag a monitor over to it
11,01Sumi: maybe.

Choveck: what i don't get, is how he still belives you give him something after you insulted him with the first sentence...
damn I keep hitting enter at innapropriate moments :/
Choveck, I wish there was some sort of trap login that savvy people targetted by phishers could give out just to get the phisher caught.
pot80: Try typing in part of their names and push tab. It should complete it.
Thanks Spectrum_Rush. Looks like people are slowly gathering for the conference, none of the panel are there yet
Yeah that's a mystery
