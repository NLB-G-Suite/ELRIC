The spray on skin graft is interesting
Sorry for pinging ya both
What's this
The earliest citation given in the Oxford English Dictionary for any word used as a name for this element is alumium
13we pronounce it le-zhure, you pronounce it lie-zoo-re-ay
13we say erb and you say HHHerb
looks tasty
okay how do you pronounce louisville
this is creeping me out D:
13loo-ee-vill
And you complain for us missing out letters :]
it was suggested as aluminum but regected in the same year
doughnuts are made of dough. not "do"
13but you can't take my word for it because minnesota is screwed up
some pronounce it louis-ville
13how would you pronounce "wayzata"
