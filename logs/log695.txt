and I've seen the present, I see you're full of bollocks.
:>
Lil_B: ohai
08,01yay
Meanwhile, then buy the damn cake -__-
/me makes the chat explode
08,01my server only draws 0.5A of current!
they need to show it
Make a cake.
I CAN SEE EVERYTHING!!!
From where? I live in the middle of nowhere.
08,01this means i can colocate it really cheaply in the netherlands!
O-o
On my left, field, on my right, field, in front of me, field, in back of me, field.
>fumbles really
With Courage the cowardly dog?
Dr_Fumbles thanks :)
Well technically there's a village here but the village is surrounded by field.
Meanwhile, no wonder you are disgruntled.
np, all shall be greeted!
Stop being mean to me, I had to spend 3 hours on busses earlier.
I'd enjoy being in the middle of nowhere.
im going to brush my teeth.....with toothpaste
Meanwhile: I live in PA, home of nothing and a cultural wasteland
Meanwhile, I'm just mimicing your personae.
How can one be in the middle of nowhere if you don't know where nowhere is?
I do enjoy being in the middle of nowhere, but it's not exactly swimming in cake shops.
Start a cake shop.
:>
I can't bake.
Well damn.
Learn how
now i want cake
/me bakes everyone a virtual cake
>meanwhile>get pinkipie
Sumica, SB and Shizka know how to bake... Meanwhile, maybe you should add an S to your name.
How do you bake a cake, it's something like add eggs flour sugar whip until frothy apply heat then sprinkle with sugar.
Or is that how to prepare lobster.
Meanwhile: You forgot the lemons... and optionally worms
/me is confused.
Leeeeeroooooy
/me pets ASoftFluffyThing
:$
This talk of food and the fact that Panda is here is rekindling my desire to eat panda-bear.
mmmmmm panda UGHGUGHHGHGH
meanwhile> you should get pinkie pie to bake for you
Good luck with that. My ex said I taste very good Meanwhile.
*cough*
Panda are you an actual bear?
IT'S A COOKBOOK!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rMYGppQ_vI this was cool
Meanwhile, I can be, so I've been told.
Well, since bear is slang for a big gropey homosexual, that doesn't surprise me.
LOL
Meanwhile heh, is that an issue?
pony_2468: dem lasers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmVnOyCha5Y
I was a little pissed of when I found out that a classmate build his own Lasershow and made the Programm itself >.<
I hate ingenuity
/me nuzzles Panda|DrawingandStuf

I don't even know where this is going anymore.

Meanwhile, well, me being mean to you and you using flat quips is how it started.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MgNRTq4Uu4&feature=fvwrel
/me slaps Dr_Fumbles around a bit with a pillow "No u"."
Oh, right. Stop that.
Stop what.

Yes.
Stahp wat
But I like it.
Talking?
Well I don't.
ASoftFluffyThing: ... okay...
You dont have to watch Meanwhile.

Yes. Yes he does
Yes I do. I must watch everything.
Make him watch.
Jmo more like typing
Meanwhile, again, you called me the homosexual?
Shush RPer
Because I feel like you hate everything Meanwhile
Go run to your Dashiesauce

Panda|DrawingandStuf: you enjoy the penis?
i be no RPer here.. i be annoy you it seems
I hate Francis.
pony_2468, nope.

Panda|DrawingandStuf: Being homo, and watching homo, are two different things. RIght?

Hateception

Probably.

bye people

<3
Bye pon--aww, they gone
Hey Panda just checking you're not being like, serious are you? Because I was just having some fun.
is there any of yall that live in houston texas
Meanwhile, so you are mean for fun. Fancy that.
I like to think that every numbered pony is the same red and black OC
mfw Meanwhile asks if the internet is serious.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03UeITHT9H8
Chat needs some random
Hey whats the name of that video were the spy disgise as woody from toy story?
/me searches Youtube for random
I like to check, if I'm trying to make someone cry then that's fine they can go cry but if I'm not trying to and they do anyway I feel kinda bad about it.
Is bomberman music random enough?
Moopy: Give me a sec
ok
Meanwhile: understandable
Meanwhile, I come from an mentaly and physically abusive home, you'd have to try harder than that to make me cry.
I guilt trip myself way to much to be an ass hole on the internet
nemnemnemnemnem
It ruins all my fun
It was just an expression Panda, I just want to make sure you're not genuinely bothered.
Meanwhile, nothing bothers me.
See this is what I look like when I care about your feelings.
just send me the link when your done searching it up ok
Meanwhile: A somewhat likeable person?
this one? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoB_MDSkHms
No, the same unlikeable person just I'll ask every so often if you're bothered.
let me see
Did Meanwhile just grow a heart? Or is this a facade? Tune in next time to Bronystate.
Have some giant dancing scuba men thing.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3Nt0iAu3qwhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3Nt0iAu3qw
Meanwhile has no heart
eeyup thanks dude
Its just a void
On the internet I don't have the luxury of reading your facial expression so I have to straight up ask.
Moopy: np
:)
Love that vid
Meanwhile, normally I am emotionless.
So that wouldnt help you either.
And yeah, like Vicky from the Fairly Odd Parents, the spot where my heart should be is just a black hole.
Well Panda you sound like a right misery.
I'm a robot...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srPUmJF3Lis
Meanwhile, nope :) I like a happy life.
lul
>Normally emotionless
>Likes happy life
Wut
Make your mind up.
Meanwhile, my mind is made up. Normally=/=All the time.
hahahahahahahahaha that shit cracks me up on this video here were the spy was raping the soldier hahahahahahaha
Wow... I should seriously be doing something right now :S
lol ya
Well...I dunno, keep doing that then. I guess.
Poyo
Dr_Fumbles, like what? This is Bronystate, work doesn't exist outside of this place.
Everyone knows this <3
Lol, so true
Meanwhile, wouldn't have it any other way.
ding
I am the one who knock knocks

/me can't find anything to post here
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srPUmJF3Lis Play this over and over till stream starts
Jmo, I never liked Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
inb4 angry mob
aw :(
ASoftFluffyThing then your childhood kinda sucked...
^
ASoftFluffyThing: THat's fine.
Each to their own
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hmDZz5pDOQ This stream needs more Monty Python
Different views for different people. :)
Everything needs Monty Python
oh hai AJIsAwesome :3
Panda|DrawingandStuf, I never liked it because my little brother would beat me to the TV every Saturday morning and played that.
ohai, Panda|DrawingandStuf. :)
Same with Power Rangers.
That shits loud dude
Ah siblings.
Though I'd rather watch TMNT than Power Rangers any day
Mighty Morphin' Ã¼ber alles.
ASoftFluffyThing, so you never gave it a chance because of sibling rivalry?
this entire channel is siblings XD
Panda|DrawingandStuf, yeah just about.
I am fail.
Kids WB was my childhood... then the CW happened
ASoftFluffyThing: Don't say that. :D
ASoftFluffyThing, ^^ If I did that I wouldnt like ponies.
/me humms the Monty Python intermission theme
:O imagine if we were all siblings! We'd be the biggest pony generation! And we'd have really weird and fun family reunions!
Panda|DrawingandStuf, true :3. But my god Power Rangers annoyed me. My brother had just about all the action figures
Kurra, and many food fights over who is best pony.
If you were all my siblings I'd disown you.
YEAH TOAST!
Food fights ammagosh so fun except it wastes food
Nemnemnemnem
Meanwhile, hence why you are alone.
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
hi
He had one that was like 2 feet tall. I think that made me say "I'm not gonna even acknowledge Power Rangers anymore"
I have an actual sibling, she's a bigger bitch than I am.
Hi, puffmuffins. :)
ASoftFluffyThing: you and I must have similar tastes in TV
ASoftFluffyThing, its fine.
Which is ironic, because she's also like 3 inches shorter.
Meanwhile: I find that hard to believe
You have no idea.
Meanwhile, heh, challenge accepted. I've dealt with FAR worst than you.
/me throws the Monty Python rabbit into the chat
smelt, whats the dare today?
/me has never seen Monty Python
/me runs and panics
/me inb4 more angry mob
um.....
ASoftFluffyThing: Never seen it either.
Neither have I Fluffy
darn ive been spotted!
My sister entertains herself by looking for people on facebook that post "Waa I'm so fat" type stuff and then comments with "Yeah, yeah you are. Fucking fatty."
flee!
Get on with it!
Meanwhile: They deserve it
/me should get to expanding her music playlist
Meanwhile, thats it? thats childs play. How about syphoning sugar into a gas tank so that the car becomes bricked.
/me doesn't hat fat people, just the self loathing type
That's nice Panda I literally do not care at all.
*hate
Dr_Fumbles, then you'll hate me <3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zPeccbnvdo Needs more Green Greens
why are we even talking about the mean things people do? :/
ASoftFluffyThing: I could never hate you
Kurra: Because boredom
And lack of random shit
weeeee
Kurra: because we're humans
Kurra, seeing the extent of Meanwhile and his family :3
So I'll post something from Japan
....
Run! It's godzilla!
Actually due to international copyright laws, it is not.
/me notes that apparently all of you have forgotten pony, at least overtly.
Still we should like it is godzilla!
HOLY FUCK I FORGOT!
*run
Although, it isn't.
c.c
Pony Up Podcast!
Kurra, how so? I myself am not mean.
Meanwhile: But we should run all the same
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLyBVoVZkPM
or something
forgot reference
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3Elh4vM1ws&feature=related I really like the music in Kirby's Epic Yarn
boy how do I say it in a way that's not going to make everyone say GTBO
Kurra, whatchu plannin on saying?
/me sighs
Always loved Kirby music
and then Kurra left.
/me sits on Panda|DrawingandStuf
PONDOO
/me shows Jmo his sketch
you like?
Kirby's Epic yarn was apperently not supposed to be a kirby game at first
Not too surprising
I laik.
Turns out the 2nd player aka Prince Fluff was supposed to be the main character
:>
Does anyone know if Bronyville is still doing podcasts?
prolly not.
Beep boop son beep boop
Wow, I didn't eat breakfast yet :S I should go do that
Oh no I have turned into a foot!
oh dear
Is anything playing, or just my player wont load?

Duke Nukem Forever, as in, Duke Nukem should've stayed in development Forever and never come out.
/me has no idea how to describe sci's music
ASoftFluffyThing: I didn't know him, sorry. I was confused with someone else.
Tuuurtle.
But theres this another game to its called Duke Nukem forever the docter who cloned me

What should I be for Hallowwen?
Think I'll go back to Two Best Friends Play.
No problem SafariMonkey. :)
MadSurge: I wanna see what happens with the changelings
Meanwhile! AJIsAwesome! :$
ASoftFluffyThing: Depends on your interests. What do you like?
MadSurge! :$
'Lo MadSurge.
Jmo! :$
Jmo: Oh, you! :D
GigabitHarmonie: OH NO :D
O U Ayejay
Jmo: :P
AJIsAwesome I would go as Pinkie but the costumes are like 130 bucks for adults
Ouch.
So I guess I'll ahve to make my own
The only other ones are for little girls
ASoftFluffyThing: You could dress up as Gummy. :3
ASoftFluffyThing: You should go as Rarity! :) Prettiest of all!
AJIsAwesome, I dun wanna.
Rarity is a mule.
GigabitHarmonie but...Pinkie is best pony
RARITY IS BEST PONY
No exceptions!
Also, I hope there's an actual Halloween stream at the appropriate time. At least something I watch better have some horror movies on it.
Rarity is best mule.
Panda|DrawingandStuf, nice way of spelling Pinkie. :3
Meanwhile, but you outrank her.
ASoftFluffyThing, but pinkie is second :<
Panda|DrawingandStuf, but she's pink!
CGI madness.
ASoftFluffyThing, I know, but I like off white and purple...
nomnomnom
Double Patty Midnight Madness!~
Panda|DrawingandStuf, I like pink :D
Though my OC in my head is a light blue for some reason
I don't know why
oh hey, its sonic
Ponies, I must go because school. Bye bye~
Bye, ASoftFluffyThing. :)
Bye ASoftFluffyThing! :)
/me hugs everyone <3
/me hugs back tight.
That's not how you use a cane.
Oh, wait-- that's supposed to be a sword.
Dat face
DAT FACE
It doesn't surprise me that Kencolt knows the proper way canes work, since they were only just implemented when he was in school.
That smile
GigabitHarmonie: Thanks. :D
... rapy rapy time
Haha
Meanwhile: I know why they work because I have an artificial hip and walk with one. :P
Kencolt: I should've made that joke instead. :P
:O GigabitHarmonie is streaming? :$ how wonderful!
hey all
Meanwhile: I'm not joking.
Kencolt: Oh I know.
MadSurge: Yes, my friend! :)
Hi, otherness. :)
Howdy otherness!
whats this then? ^^
Hoo biy...
*boy
And for the record--having worn one from time to time, that's not how a sword should properly be worn either. To unstable.
Kencolt fought in the crusades you know.
/me facehoofs
Seems legit
Meanwhile: Actually-- not quite as silly as you might think. I used to be a member of of the Society for Creative Anachronism, a medieval recreation organization. I was, back then, a rather respected minstrel.
Kencolt is best minstrel. Now canon.
Pfff
Like a BOSS
The statues are like "this is the silliest fight ever"
I never understood the whole vampire hates garlic thing
SpadeMagnes[School] garlic has purifing properties
Story hijacking!
SpadeMagnes[School]: Old European/Middle eastern belief. Garlic was considered to have healing and purifying properties, there fore, by connection, should be good against the undead and/or the evil.
Man, I wish I could be watching this now
Kandarihu: I'll try to restream it later tonight actually for people that don't get to see it now! :)
LE TWIST
GigabitHarmonie, thanks. But I'm gonna be watching the debates tonight. Sorry but my schedule is packed today.
People actually watch that?
I never watched the debates
Kandarihu: Understood friend! :)
I just cant sit through...what? Two hours?
D:
That's......actually pretty creepy.

Sucks when you can't control that sort of thing
ShyBetaFemale: I just screencapped an image of Urkel a while back on the stream. Take a look. :D http://i.imgur.com/9ez0f.jpg
Kandarihu I am impressed by that devotion. You are forgiven just for that.
he's gonna fail the test because he can;t concentrate
Aaaaand there's the drawback.

So clean the room already
for me it is easier than java :p
I'm going to kick you out when u get here

/me breaks out his Megabuster
Maybe I should try c++ haha

Shizuka O_o when did you learn how to sleep talk?
Shizuka: awesome, sleepwalking typer :D
so he come to steal cans from here
Shizuka: Tm's. :3
Wait
Damn
You know the lpan
well gonna go back to xcom
I meant Panda|DrawingandStuf. :3
plan
lurk mode activated
in java you dont have to take care about memory freeing, but in c++ you have to (except is if you are using vectors, what I do)
AJIsAwesome, nah, I'm sure she learns it at level 100 :3
*exception

Shizuka: and now i look for more Asuka pics for you
HIYA everypony btw
Shizuka wants to learn sleep talk but can only learn four moves
Delete a move?
Hi, Bronysith. :)
Y
13shizu forgot sleep well and learned sleep talk
xD
Shizu can learn as many moves as she wants. :3

You'll probably be waiting a while.
/me throws a master ball at Shizuka
and java doesn't give you so low-level freedom, but it will point out dumb mistakes more easily, because what is mistake in Java can be some weir technnique in C++
/me 13used DOOOOOODGE
/me smacks the ball
*weird
Damn
No.
/me debugs Shizuka
Shizu should never be captured. :3
/me sends out MISSINGNO.
MadSurge: Agreed. :3
no stream?
/me throws master ball at AJIsAwesome
/me slaps master ball
No.
guess who has an actual date!
BUT YOUR A RARE POKEMON!! D:
I DO :D
"You don't have enough badges to train me!"
Shizuka I assume I used the wrong "Stack Trace"?
13panda got it~
I think it is better to start in C++ than in java, because the code in c++ is more clear I think
WOO HOO!!!!
ah ok
C++ teaches you real skills.
Panda|DrawingandStuf: Where was that from? :P
haha
AJIsAwesome, it has to do with programing
Ah.
HOW MANY POINTS DO I RECIEVE?
Then I got nothing. :3

i'm on the pursuit of happiness and i know, everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
hey
Haio Sumica
ohai, Sumica. :)
i'll be fine once i get it, i'll be gooooood
how are things Sumica
Well you guys know more about programming than me, so I guess I'll listen to you
Sumica:HI DERE!
Shizuka -__- only 2? How I trade it back for wub and call it a day :D
Pikachu aim for the horn!
MadSurge: It's nice. :3
it is better to start learning with multiplatform libraries, so your apps can be used on other OSs
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmvm8zW0toE&feature=related
yeah
MadSurge: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/43a9fb35981ded60d870f3454ab95d08.jpg
but of course for the basics you can use standard libraries. when you head on GUI, you have to choose some good library for it
<.<
>.>
Oy, Phase, may I try do something not legal?
I have a hunch of a possible exploit that may exist.
http://cheezburger.com/6470286592
/me plays the Song of Storms
/me sniffs the air
O_O MY QUEEN?
00,10ohhi Vordox
/me glomps Chrysalis_
Hai Sumica.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNwjUWKP18c
o.0
Mind I try a possible exploit(It's about account usage)
and there is one important rule generally in programming: reusability of code
/me puts Sumica ontop of Chrysalis_
Glory to the Changling nation
what just happened?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX0PVZwvxQQ
oh
/me plays the Song of Double Time
so you don't have to do the same code again and again in all your projects
I guess not.
00,10bah NLR is the supperior nation
so for example I have my own library, where I can create window with one line :)
Fine, Glory to the NLR and the Changling nation
00,10I think phase is alseep Vordox
Sumica: Ah dang, I think I found a way around the "Identify" yourself system
So I can take any account, but not being kicked for it
so I don't have to do the preparation of the library all the time for every project
Fus ro dah
(Of course, without logging in)
Sumica! a guy asked me out, and to a fancy resturaunt too!
00,10that would probably be best reported to the IRCop level
i get to wear a pretty dress :3
ah thats good
/me advises against that Vordox
wat
Bronystate, whut?
but for the beginning in console you don't have to bother with this
Sumica: Alright. But I need to test it, and that means being in this chat with a fake account name.
XD
Lyra` D: dat lucky guy!
Of course, testing to see if it's work as planned, or not.
Are we there yet Vegeta
13should report it to #help
hey, bronystate, how about we go back to my place, and we play video games :D
Shizuka: It's actually so easy even I am suprised .>.>
Are we there yet
Lyra` :D
00,10and well yeah you could always do that Vordox so long as the peroson dont have nick enforce on
Nick Enforce?
Vordox change your nick to Panda and you will see
Ok
13oh.. yeah that's just nick enforce >>
No! My space pod!
My space armor!
Hello?
Panda, wait for it
13and in 30 seconds
And I haven't tried to log in...
00,1029....28
btw why always when I want to type apostrophe ( ' ) I always type $ instead :D I almost typed ...n$t three times
Oh, okay, waiting.
its rather odd seeing another panda
but I corrected it :)
Hai Panda.
HOw are you?
00,10they are so rare
ew
Fake panda
More Pandaren!
Ew
Fake Jmo
I am fake, and I do not deny it.

Real Jmo or gtfo :3
hi
00,10long 30 seconds
Hello?
...
13always is when you're waiting
Haio Applejack2012

I'm still not kicked...

Will the real Panda please stand up?

13you don't get kicked

Really?
HAPPY NEW YEAR
OH COME ON NICK SERV!
I think I found a way around this...
00,10did you forget to set enforce panda?
Oh shit.
This is where Panda isnt actually registered
which panda is the real panda?
we can't trust either
Logging back
D:
so we have to kill both
SPY CHECK
One that is drawing
Did you have nickforce, Panda?
/me runs away
13panda doesn't have enforce on
Vordox, try it again...
Derp.
panda, someone was here trying to impersonate you!
Hahaha XD
00,10fun fact if you dont use a registered name for 30 days it's released back in to the wild.
Try it on chrysalis
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZEV84o_E7U
Chrys's name?
mine did
:3
unless you put it on vacation, Sumica
XD
How is it spelt, really UnFoundBug ?
I fucking love Dedede's theme
sudden bikey :3
Chrysalis
big C little C ettc
haha
Ok, brb
13UnFoundBug: protip, you don't have enforce on either
wait for it :P
Test
tset
How do you enforce your nick?
poof
13or ghost
Shizuka, um... how do you enforce?
ahhh
kinda like kicking
There we go.
13yeah but that's ghost
but you dont need to be a mod :D
13try nicking to shizuka
00,10well that is ghost, not the same as nick enforce
13that will bump you off the nick
c++ and java are similar (and both are OOP), so If you learn one, you should be able to understand the other one in many things
>.>
O_o
I got Dced right now
better than kicking, actually
Did it work?
Capital S
Hm...
00,10Vordox you got ghost kicked
You ned to have Enforce on to not being able to get it
Yep
Hmmm
I need to try again.
If you do not have enforce, I can take ANY nick.
this irc stuff is quackers
So... everyone ENFORCE stuff
13there it goes
?
do be do
AH!
???
OKIES!
What's going on?
awww
13lul
/me starts throwing Waddle Dees into the chat
13now i can't nick back to me XD
Lol Shizu XD
Are you FAKE Shizu ?!
they are a lot different.
00,10time to ghost Shizu
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTgUzYUyeW8
YOU FOOL
13you can whois me and it'll tell you i'm idented
/me catches waddle dees and throws them back
if you learn C++ your skills will transfer over to other languages though, which is the case once you know one language well.
Waddle Dees are adorable
C++ teaches you good habits.
and with autokicks on colours
must find photos of asuka
well they are more similar than for example python
Bronysith: No :P
hmm, did you guys ever fix the bug
Shizu is haruko@shizuka.kamishima * Shizuka Kamishima...
Hm...
where you can use colours and not get kicked?
or pure c
such a place, exist Chrysalis?
Chrysalis: Anywhere except here
/me uses a Warpstar
I'm a turtle.
nope, in here
Shizu: http://cdn03.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/max350x350/encyc/A8422-20.jpg
YA DONT SAY
Shizu, with brakets?
the autokicks have a bug
had*
13no brackets
but I don't say that they are the same
not sure whether it is still here
yes i do say
13make your own channel silly
test
But C++ might be frusterating for someone new to programming because it takes a while to see the fruits of your labour.
4test
13sumica isn't in here

Satty!
13but his kick script monitors /me now
ah you didnt ever fix it

thats how i look int he mroning
PILLZ HERE
in this house, weird is normal and pony is %100
/me registers EVERYTHING that is not registered yet
Shizuka how do you do that?
Vordox having multple at once via cloning is against the rules
but not registerin multiple nicks
what is this
wow.....
poor goblin
Pricks...
00,10to answer your earlyer question Chrysalis, try and find out

08,01Stallion_of_War: she *does* sound like Jackie, actually
So, is this about random people having superpowers or?

08,01it's a bunch of ASBOs having superpowers
08,01it's hilarious
ASBO?
^
hi all
I'll just google that...
http://s.funnymama.com/store/121015/113008_v0_600x.jpg * Facedesk Facedesk Facedesk Facedesk Facedesk Facedesk * DAMNIT WORLD
What the fuck is an ASBO?!
08,01ASBO = Antisocial Behaviour Order
how are things Derpy_Hooves
08,01it's a thing in the UK
lol facedesk
08,01also used to describe the sort of people who get ASBOs
i live in the uk aswell, what the hell?
>live in UK
>don't know what an ASBO is
What the actual fuck.
ikr
Lol!
Vordox: forbidden O_o
MadSurge: ._. Dang
I had to look up what an OAP was, given it's not an acronym here.
Lmao
Sjin's community pool and all
Vordox: what is it?
they dont give out ASBOs any more
because chavs started using them as badges of honour
MadSurge: http://funnymama.com/post/113008 This is facedesk worthy
Coma coma coma coma coma chammelion!!!
if being an ASBO gets you powers i want to be one, please.
o.O
what we watching ayway
13shouldn't it be... antisocial behavior DISorder?
I tend to not interact with others, and I have low-level superpowers so...
Vordox: Is that even? english
O_O
MadSurge: I don't WANT to know...
Misfits, Derpy_Hooves.
SOUL STEALERRRRRRRR
what
wat?
Uhhm
08,01btw, what i did there calling the those guys ASBOs
08,01that was a 'metanym'
Are these people prisoners?
Shizuka: "An Anti-Social Behaviour Order or ASBO ( /ËÃ¦zboÊ/) is a civil order"
From wiki
13mfw
08,01a metanym is using something associated with something else to describe that thing
Stallion_of_War: community service
So it's Order because it's a 'civil order', apparently.
So they are!
13but...
08,01like calling the newspapers "the press"
13if they're antisocial...
13what are they doing forming an order?
XD
13i am confus
As am i X_x
Ask the league of Hermits

:O
Yep.
ok sorry
why us can't post video links during stream?
because we can't.
Its rude to the streamer
It pulls you away from their stream
because we are not awesome enough.
08,01applejack`: it's because we're a streaming site
so many lockers and those 5 are ALWAYS the only ones.
08,01it's kinda like going into a cinema with a tv and going "hey people, watch this instead!"

MadSurge: i know right
Bronysith: and it's not even the "sexual" liking :D
i'm 14 and iv'e never had a love bite ;_;
MadSurge: i dont think its sexual
08,01Lil_B: i do!
Bronysith: that's what I'm saying
Is a love bite the same as a hickey?
... sorry, but my chat derped I can't read whoever just pinged me >.<
08,01RaveBrony: yup
gotta restart
If he's his dark side, couldn't he just off himself?
what's a hickey?
08,01Lil_B: it was me
08,01and i said yes, i do know Metropolis
=_(\ turtlegod98
a hickey is a skin disease in which the skin decays right off the body
well, that was strange
its rumored that the infected skin is tasty so people try to eat it
08,01Buytoast: er, what?
ok, I'm here again and can read again >.<
wtf?
ahahaha
A hickey occurs after sucking on part of the skin hard/long enough :D
turtlegod98, a hicky is when you suck your's or anothers skin to the point where the blood pools right under the skins surface. It's kinda like a bruise.
o god
turtlegod98: A hickey, is a bruise or bruise like mark caused by the kissing or sucking of the skin, usually on the neck or arm.
can someone give me a quick copy and paste of the text pinged me a few sec ago?
hello brony people

How old is this clip?
well, we have reached the smallest possible conection for a on/off switch in a Processor. It was a makro - molekule with about 100 Carbon Atoms, but still, the thought of heaving only one molekule as a half contuctor... so much enegery could be safed coupled with insane speeds
But I known them most nombley for thier tvs.
IBM stored 2 bits of data on 3 atoms :3
wow xD
whoa wtf
drugs
I think the most powerful processor of them all was the Premium series.
i stay away from them
I mean, Pentium.
But Pentium is old news
hey everypony :)
now we only have to couple this with the Gel-Battery and the Electricity-Producing Bakteries (or was it a Virus? I forgot)

thisguy: HEAT!? We're freezing our tits off in Britain
:)
Serenity, do you think wet manes are *pun alert* manestream?
funny, usually there's an i before the um in those words
05aliminium
05for the swedes
well, maybe the word "wet" i guess
germany says aluminium too
/me shoots sonicdude558
Shizuka, i've never been sure which is which, its a strange word either way
taoumi: You don't use the u's
/me dodges the bullet like a bawss :3
silly brits, forgetting letters
Grrr
13serious btw, i'm pretty sure when discovered it was named "aluminum", but scientists later changed to "aluminium" because other elements end in -ium
using a hammer to cut. your argument is invalid
Colour. Honour, Alluminium,
alumoluum
did-u-know you cannot by hand reflatten a crumbled up peice of aluminum without breaking it?
05even better
I'm going to take off. I have a favor to attend to.
13yeah but phase you fry shrimp on barbies so :3
HI SPEED GLUING
/me gets hit by Serenity's bullet

Bye, Everlasting_Joy. :)
Goodbye Everlasting_Joy

bye Everlasting_Joy
Bye Everlasting_Joy :)
do we have any famous brony chemist?
00,10squick time
13Dark_Horst: you only say that cause you know it as aluminium
:D tuttie fruutie
Serenity: /) !
13AFTER the name change
Shizuka: yep
THERE'S HOPE
we should name a mineral/element Bronium
SeaponiesofLiverpool: There's Chrysalis, he knows a bit, but Alchemist is our scientist
13we murricans honor the traditional pronunciation
Brony-um
The spray on skin graft is interesting
Sumica Also i have sniped atleast over 10 if not more enemy aircraft out of the sky with my tank today :D
Sorry for pinging ya both
What's this
The earliest citation given in the Oxford English Dictionary for any word used as a name for this element is alumium
Shizuka: strontium is a very unfortunate name :D
/me agrees with SeaponiesofLiverpool
Shizuka, and yet donuts instead of doughnuts
thats a small sample
13we pronounce it le-zhure, you pronounce it lie-zoo-re-ay
Shizuka: Honour* :P
13we say erb and you say HHHerb
looks tasty
okay how do you pronounce louisville
Sumica I need no AA cannons i got a 105mm cannon to take out aircraft :D
srsly, that really gets me, donut looks like its pronounced 'do-nuts'
this is creeping me out D:
13loo-ee-vill
What is this
And you complain for us missing out letters :]
it was suggested as aluminum but regected in the same year
doughnuts are made of dough. not "do"
yay! me too
13but you can't take my word for it because minnesota is screwed up
some pronounce it louis-ville
13how would you pronounce "wayzata"
whinne-sota
Phase4: I thought it was spelled "Doughnut"
way-zahtah
/me hugs Mega_Milk
13nope
:3
13ready
:(
Mega_Milk, that is how its spelt, the us gets it wrong
test.
13why-zet-uh
13dead serious
wat
Shizuka: Sounds australian
Phase4: -lol
13nicollet avenue in minneapolis, "nick-o-let" even though it's obviously french
Did the aussiegrits make that metal up?
13hamline avenue is "ham-lin" not "ham line"
pronounce didgeridoo
hippopotomonstrosousquipadeliophobia
didger ree doo
so whats being made here
I want a hippopotamus for x-mas
Shizuka, o_O
13also dead serious
PRONOUNCE hippopotomonstrosousquipadeliophobia
Shizuka: so it's baeg and taeg? :D
http://derpy.me/VAjkf
13yup
RDash5000, i'd rather not, my tounge may fall out
how do they say bagel?
13same as always, "bay-gul"
hippopotomonstrosousquipadeliophobia is one of my favorite words ever
BAEGUHL
hippo-poto-monstr-sou-squi-padel-lee-oh-phobia
13but yeah, minnesotan is a very distinctive accent, pretty much any time you have a "midwestern" character in, say, a pixar flick, it's some actress from around here doing very heavy minnesotan
/me gives SeaponiesofLiverpool a brohhof /)
13thankfully i don't have it, i was born in illinois and moved to arizona at a young age and then up here when i was ten, that kind of forces accents out of you

Alea Iacta Est
the pimp mobile

DeadpoolDash: Yeah, I can understand that.

DeadpoolDash: why are the characters bad though
It's usually the character design that turns people off.
Big anime eyes
am i the only brony that thinks sonic is faster than RD
I am a number
Zero is best number
cant stand the voices and the cliche characters involved
so... Zero is an Eleven... hm...

What did I just watch J_E_Smith71
...I wish I could get one of the mods to rip that and show that as a random video...
Canadian_Brony: he can still kick most normal pples asses, and his "loss" against bruce lee was scripted. Both chuck AND bruce admitted that chuck would win in an actual fight
J_E_Smith71: all of my wut :D
Conyst: It's from Alyas Batman en Robin, one of those weird forgein superhero films
J_E_Smith71: that would explain it
Canadian_Brony: not to mention I also know where indiana jones lives
MaconBane: Bane of all Macon's existance?
DoctoDoctorWho although Chuck is an amazing fighter, and I never watched the fight between him and Bruce, my statement remanes unphazed. I'm also not that big of and Indy fan, so you haven't really said much to deter me.
NewSuperBronyU: boo
Canadian_Brony: name a famous person, Ill know where they live within the week. And if Im determined, where they buy groceries...

Shizuka: I'm never crushed when you run a Rifftrack

13hmm
13but first
My military will have installed anti-nuclear defence systems all around my nation
Shizuka: Assuming control :3
LOL at Lola on the Looney Tunes Show right now. "I once heard about a man who had a spider crawl into his ear and the spider laid eggs in there and the spider babies ate his brain."
Inb4 impossible buffering.
Canadian_Brony: u still here?
DoctoDoctorWho where would you get the military, where would your nation be, and how the hell are you going to overtake it.
and yes, I"m still here
Yay Shizuka!
Forever buffering

Plug it in plug it in
Yay! Penn and Teller!
Shizuka: <3 love these guys
Penn and Teller, good stuff.

You going somewhere Shizu?
Dat cock roach said "Looooove meeee"

What are we watching?!?! O_o

Canadian_Brony: I plan on indirectly causing rebellions in 3rd world area's overthrowing local dictators and such, then I will install my own personalised government system that is both fair and powerful and discreetly build a powerful military while showing a peacful public face to the international community.
O_O

Meanwhile: Eeyup.
Ponies47 Penn and Teller: Bullshit
Ah
BUGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THEY HAVE PROTIEN JUST LIKE PEANUT BUTTER
That's nice.
So what the heck is this denouncing?
wut.
132.89 for gas? oh the days gone by
ikr
i prefer to eat peanut butter though
You don't even drive.
DoctoDoctorWho and you nation will be where?
sonicandmario85: Roach=peanut butter, seems legit.
Try 4 dollars!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Africa
dat unnecesary swearing
THE NUMBERS MASON!
Wait, what episode is this about?
damn
Penn and Teller: Numbers attack
Okay.
Canadian_Brony: As I said, some 3rd world area, possibly africa
wow
Thanks, Conyst. :)
DoctoDoctorWho:not really i didnt say bugs were peanut butter their just healthy for you african kids eat bugs
Dovah is Pissed off
Why, Dovah?
Dovah: ohai :2
sonicandmario85 you strike me as the type of kid who eats bugs anyway.
AJIsAwesome: I dont know
13been hovering barely under $4 in MN
Canadian_Brony: 3.50 or so right now
13i don't think it's broken yet but it's between 3.50 and 4
Ohai Dovah :)
per gallon?
and my cat seems to love grass hoppers so i guess they must taste good XD i never ate bugs at all in life so idk what they taste like
Yep
like $4.99 here....
13dad has something like a 40 mile commute
I'm confused why you complain about gas despite not driving.
jeez, and I thought it was bad up here. Scratch what I said, you're suffering.
1.32 per litre
$9000.9000 here
sonicandmario85: unless you sleep with some filter over your mouth you have eaten bugs
$4.10 here
13Meanwhile: high price > less money > more family stress > more shizu stress
3.80 for gas here
When was this episode made anyway?
Chain makes sense. Carry on.
1307 i think
Shizuka: there is a solution!
Conyst:i put my blanket over my head so it can keep warm i doubt theres any bugs in my bed
wut :I
13and being minnesota biking isn't much of a solution six months out of the year
. . . FIFTEEN A LITRE?!?
Shizuka: I have a solution to your stress!
you're getting screwed!
besides i dont even think theres bed bugs in this house either
13we also have something like 50 cent federal tax on top of a pile of other taxes on gas
13DoctoDoctorWho: do tell
Shizuka: you are going to hate me but...
i had steak n shake today
Shizuka: Become... RICH!:D
Sith everyone hates you anyway.
13D:
ohai Bronysith
Meanwhile: thats just you,
Meanwhile:....i dont hate him ):
13well... we intend to have steak n shake before return takeoff on sunday
and a few otehrs >.>
13so it is coming
Bronysith: No i hate you too
Bronysith: Fair enough, sonicandmario85 likes you. Which isn't really any better.
never had steak and shake
13doubt we have any other normalites here so can't really ask if anyone's had avanti's gondolas

stupid lawyers
and nittany
Bronysith: Nah im jk :3
Bronysith: I'll give you nittany but I'm fairly sure the rest hate you.

Canadian_Brony: Lawyer, another cockroach!
13N&N is best candy

no wait, I take that back
I don't hate you
Shizuka: N&N? -lol
13several way lots
Jones candy is best candy
The hell is N&N?
then the metric shit ton
13they can't say M&M
m&m
/me glomps taoumi
13because lawyers
Ah.
hey taoumi
Right.
what about a Fuck Ton?
To me, 3 is a few, and more than that is more than a few.
hallo again Bronysith
13same reason the show is called bullshit, they can't say "such and such is a scam, so and so is a liar" cause they'd get defamation suits
13but they can say "this guy is an asshole, and that's bullshit"
13therefore, show
Splendid.

cachi01|MW3: and thats how WWII started
Mega_Milk:i can brake you open and drink you
Mega_Milk: What a tweest!
cachi01|MW3: if you print more money it becomes worthless
Kandarihu well, good times to those that didn't care

AJIsAwesome: :3

sonicandmario85: Speacial glass.
13whoa whoa whoa, things melt when they're hot?

Dken2021, the people who didn't care might. rage when the entitlement spending stops.
hahaha canadian shit
Canadian shit?
Shizuka: No no no :3
ASSHOLE!
AJIsAwesome: Look at me with your special eyes :3
13okay good... my whole worldview was in jeopardy there for a moment
Mega_Milk: Why?
Don't be crazy, melting is a myth. Like cricket and tarmax.
theres a twsit though-only solids melt
AJIsAwesome: Im your brand of milk ^-^
*twist
Shizuka:when their extremly hot for example you can throw a metal object in it and it will be turned to molten metal because its hot
you know throw it in lava?
:D
Sigh.
/me it was time to interrupt Dr Whatever.
also Mega_Milk things can evaporate when their hot enough XD liquids can
Meanwhile: :D
pfft, strategy
sonicandmario85: My bottle prevents this.
Here's my strategy: wing it and hope for the best.
thats witchcraft......:3
So, what about humans? will we melt?
i can tell pinkie created your bottle
yes you will burn to death
yesh.
13anyone get the lottery right?

i wanna know what dose this gota do with ponys ITHAS TO DO WITH FUCKING LOTTERY

rainbowdash127: ponies are like lottery. random
Mega_Milk: I am? :3
Among all the scratch lottery tickets I've bought, I've won a grand total of about $25

Am I not Turtley enough for the Turtle club?
Hello!
13tuurtle tuurtle
the rearrangement looks more efficient
hi XylemTube

Then he stole it all.
This reminds me of an episode of Cowboy Bebop where a girl was using Feng Shui to escape a hit & run (among other things)
Hi, XylemTube. :)
lol

hello XylemTube
AWKWARD
ello XylemTube
hi XylemTube
does the short one talk?
There's also that episode of Sealab 2021
ohh! looks like penn and teller!
shit if I leave and don't talk for 30 minutes my internet is off
13fact penn, pinky toes were invented for the sole purpose of seeking out things to smash into so that you know they're there
DarkStratos: Nope
I agree with the toe thing.
Fire?!
Shizuka: ha I know right?!
moving nothing is a brilliant business model. I'll do this too
oh wow
lol color causes medical issues?
COLOR KILLS
red colors stimulate hunger
I stubbed my toe hard on concrete once.
Shizuka sounds like an average day in my life
red ie color of love, is BAD
Sooo... Would Penn and Teller be Unicorns or Earth Ponies? Being magicians and all.
She's actually thinking blood...
I once stubbed my pinkie to so bad that I swear it bruised up for a while.
red=blood=bad?
suddenly i feel hungery
hit ALL the corners!
13they'd be earth ponies
13they don't need that fancy magic to do their stuff
red keeps the evil spirits away
they would be earth ponies
13remember, 80% of magic tricks are not magic, technically they are sorcery
what...
It's all a game to him.
Be the Earth ponies that all Unicorns hate because they mock them
cosmic . . . volleyball . . ?
cosmic volleyball, seems legit
^ ?
Anyone around?
Cades Amu-chan Adjeca1
cosmic volleyball? I prefer the cosmic fish
DarkStratos, there is no racial animosity among the pony tribes.
psh, have to be proper about it. You forgot voodoo and witchcraft
13also yes teller talks
Kandarihu: because the ranking order is clear
13he actually has a small speaking rols in atlas shrugged part 2
what is that, derpy's living room? XD
Teller talks?

GTFO
that's awesome
omfg
OMGAAAAHD
I can do feng shui haircuts too

HOLY SHIT
$300
first, middle, and last
13uh huh..
god all this to get a hair cut
ok...?
relax darling, your haircut will be fabolous!
I can't imagine why . . .
1 hour?
The only Feng Shui i ever really paid attention to was the RPG. QWhich, by the way, was awesome. You have to love a game with a difficulty number for disarming a nuclear missile in mid flight while riding it-- and it's possible to pull off.
^
13oh my
13THE COMPUTER IS YOUR FRIEND

agreed

holy crap that chest..

Well, there's also the SNES RPG Chaos Seed in which Feng Shui is a gameplay mechanic.
She could feed all of africa with that chest!

ugh
Canadian_Brony: Well, it's usually filtered first. Just like a Brita filter.
feeling sick
nice aim
The best water I've ever had was pumped straiht out of a spring
hell, i've been using the same bottle for my water for some time now
Imma professional in the field of bottled water wine!
Canadian_Brony: THANK U FOR SAYING THAT
and it's just a dinky propel bottle
with the heavy metals in it and everything :3
>.>
I have Pur in my kitchen sink.
drinking..water...expert..
/me gives Canadian_Brony a big hug
sounds legit
The best water I've had was poured from my tap into a water jug with a filter, put in my fridge for 24 hours, and then poured into a glass on ice.
:o
/me hugs LunasGuard back
i just drink it from the tap
It's funny how not a single bottle of water appears in mlp
Canadian_Brony, that sounds refreshing
best water I had was a jug filter, good stuff

13it depends on the city really
is the taste THAT bad?
b is filled with amoebas
Ah, right. If it's not interstate commerce, it's unconstitutional for the federal government to do anything to regulate.
Filter your tap water.

That falls on the STATE Government

Lyra`, drinking from the hose is awesome. Don't have to go outside and it's nice and handy.
$6.50? for water?
Vash: maybe but when you actually tase better water, you'll notice something
I would be surprised if you said you ahve never drank from hose water.
13i know the matrix is telling my brain this water is crisp and smooth
It's better than the toilet.
glacial taste of rubber hose ;3
i dont want to live on this planet anymore

The question is will you guys do the cliche obivous route and run Luna Eclipsed on Halloween? Maybe Sumi could do a live ABC stream of Charlie Brown
"What a terrible night to have a curse."
Ah, the good 'ol Spongebob...

Luna Eclipsed... i always thought a full moon is when a person moons someone, so luna moons ponyville?
Rumors are on the 22nd Barbetos

if you could do something useful, you wouldn't be using a Mac there son
Mac. AKA Linux with a slightly different layout
But as a kid, that WAS scary...
Lyra` enjoys the Mac experience

Do you stab them afterward Barbetos?

Lyra` really? Do you know what it is like? Really? How is it?
oooooooooor you could just push the laptop for 5 seconds

not very good >.<
I don't use a Machintosh, I use a Windows... [HALLEHLUJAH]
anyway, im tired
And this is why Macs suck
im going to bed.
i like this video
You can't take a battery out of a mac.
I get the impression he's not very satisfied with the performance of the Apple Macintosh.
Night Lyra`

13now to leave you with something truly terrifying :3
Agreed
Crash different?

The mighty blue apple is keeping us from seeing season 3

MLP FiM is made on a mac.

This is not something for an Aussie
Ah man, this

IM RIGHT ABOUT EVERYHTING
IM ALWAYS RIGHT
BANG
nope, trick-or-treat bag doesn't exist anymore
D:

suprize?
I DONT NEED YOUR APPROVAL TO BE RIGHT
Da fuq is this?
Killer clown
So is this calling the reality show Bullshit>:p
whyis the short one even there..? he does nothing
Ronald???? u silly
This has never been shown where I am
GOD DAMN IT WINRARA
WINRAR
isent this a britsh show?
DarkStratos: Because he's his partner in their magic act, their a duo
DarkStratos: Teller does alot just doesn't talk much.
wait, this is talking about Big Brother? The totally stupid show that nobody watches because it's about stupid people doing stupid things and doing it so bad it's obviously staged?
yeah go fanatic but next time kill more people
if it was brittish i would have probibly heard of it
sirs its to crowded
Canadian_Brony: No the other kind of Big Brother
J_E_Smith71 . . ?
Absolute chaos
Big Brother is watching you...
ok, i'm a juggalo and that clown was creepy XD
yeah I'm here
what "other kind" of Big Brother?
Derp.
Yeah.
just doing some stuff
I was born on september 11th, though not 2001
And they called it The Patriot Act! ....wait.
The one from Codename KND
Canadian_Brony: Have you read 1984?
I need more booze.
And cigs.
AJIsAwesome nnope
Not nearly drunk enough for this
Canadian_Brony: That's what they are talking about.
As wrong as this was, I haven't heard any better ideas. I heard WORSE ideas being sold as better, but I didn't hear anything better.
big brother... its like saying "FUCK YOU!" to the topic
ok
13that depends on what the definition of "is" is
fuvk the patriot act
So confusing
dose any1 here even cared what bill clinton did?
13Kandarihu: like most things the motive was good, it was intended to improve communication between agencies, but then spiraled way out of control
nope
alcohol during a tv interview?
btw, Shizuka, ty for stream ahead of time. Its a good wrap-up to my day :)
ok
And now the Patriot Act allows the government to imprison US citizens without a reason indefinitely! Thanks Obama. :D
so does that mean the have SOPA?
13this one is pretty good
J_E_Smith71 ooooh, THAT makes sense. Thank bro
I can tell :o
while i was in New York for a week, i beat the shit out of 8 muggers
with a rock
would never gess that thing on top of the van was a camera
DAT act sounds more like SOPA act
and a broken bottle
BSS. I thought it was "BullShit Stuff"
BullShit Service
Not the terrorist pickle
or that
They taste bad.
Indeed. There's nothing wrong with improving communication between agencies. But it's hard to determine what's not far enough to be effective and what's too much and infringing on basic liberty.
13just like killzone..
Hah
Its just like it
watch the people steal the car
Jesus
In every way
now what button do i push to fire the gun?
This angers me
KILLZONE ITS AWESOME
'Murica!
'Murica
13then we started playing jazz music in the van
Shizuka : after this Curtains?

Murika right here
Canadian_Brony: So...for you its porn now? O.o
13and then there's THIS asshole
OH MAI
Oh. my.
yep
ha
Then again, that's no surprise.
Everyone is an asshole
So basically this entire staged skit can be boiled down to "YOU HAD ONE JOB"
slightly
RaveBrony I'm not legally entitled to answer that.
"slightly"
:D
Canadian_Brony: Lol :D
they built secret torture prisons all over the world based on these laws
By allowing the government to arrest you and hold you indefinitely against all forms of human rights laws
i'm back everypony :)
Just a slight increase in power.

Shizuka better than finding out I watch . . . godammit, I can't legally say it.

Stupid laws

The Patriot Act was really passed as an emergency measure.
WAR!
And for the third time....it allows the government to ARREST YOU and hold you indefinitely.
Twilight Sparkle... A terrorist?
How is that a modest or slight increase in power?
No.
DarkStratos: It's Bronystate jail they torture you with Newborn Cutise 24/7
:3
I won't believei t!
Cuties
...Twilight Sparkle? PURE EVIL!
The Bronystate jail is a scary place.

Canadian_Brony: However you want to~

Canadian_Brony: XD
LunasGuard: Yeah G3 ponies

Shizu: First rule of the Patriot Act is "we are at war". The second rule of the Patriot Act is "we are at war"
YOU MONSTERS
13in that segment, the buddha is at war
Nothing really good on ebay today :/
SORRY FOR THE VID LINK
Dj_Cyber-4G, that's a nice way to pay respect to the streamer
For shame, Dj_Cyber-4G!
13in THAT segment, the buddha is at war
Bronystate Jail is grueling, mind numbing, and repetitive. Just like.........DAYTIME TELEVISION.
13and in THAT segment, the buddha is at war
but I picked up some awesome SNES games for $5 bucks
We get it Shizuka
because our government is to power hungry..
I was one of them guest.
In that segment, the government is holding a patriot act
oh cool, which games?
Smith.
/me fly to cloud bunker
Sounds legit.
What happens in Vegas stays on YouTube
13justice department will never talk
Barb Etoes Smith.

To the secret bunker away.

I need to be entertained.
I all always feel like someones watch me
oh noez, theyre filming us walk,whatever shall we do
:o
Oh god ._.
....1 camera per five people? Fucking paranoid much?
You remember when everyone really was worried about the government treating everyone as Terrorists? That ended the moment Obama took office. Since then, Republicans and conservatives are all terrorists.
KEEP YER GOVERMENT OUTTA MY CHICAGO

The main problem with the surveillance society is that even though this power was created with the intention of bringing terrorists to justice, it's inevitable for the change of the party in power to redefine what a terrorist even is.

ok
Tom never talks, he is too quiet
DerpyMuffins seen him say a few things once
ONCE
I know this may sound weird, but I've always wanted to know this.
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Thats about the only line I seen him say
that's his bot
/me becomes timid and lurks
lurking is fun :)
For all those people who were here near the beginning of Bronystate's creation, what were the original mods like?
Nice?
Hipster_Brony was amazing
/me dances into chat
/me is signing up to be a shadowbolt
Take SB for example. He can be goofy and silly.
Funny?
I'll let you know when I'm done
AJIsAwesome he's a silly filly. What do you expect?
Has anyone done a 24 hour stream?
not that I know of
Doubt it.
Bye.
but I've been here for a relatively short time
seeya donutpop3651
Bye, donutpop3651. :)
Bye donutpop3651 :)
Bye donutpop3651
Wrek has done a 14 hour one before
Sorry, I accidentally left this up, wasn't really paying attention...
s'alright
it's called "lurking"
and it's really fun :)
Well, g'night.
I've only been here since April, and most of the mods that you guys know I didn't know. I just wanted to know what they were like on Bronystate.
/me slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
EEEEEVVVIILL!!!
nite donut
/me hugs Jmo :)
>_>
Ayejay pls
Oh Hello Jmo :)
/me is hitting the hay
Night, LunasGuard. ;)
Night LunasGuard :)

Night, LunasGuard
-O-
I need a shower >.>
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
00,10done a few 24hr streams
ill be back in a while
When did Bstate start?
fackin aussie
00,10usealy when we do marathons
AJIsAwesome I've talked to a good majority of the mods, the only ones on my list I'm yet to talk to are NewDCD, RainBroDash, VioletVanilla, and Luna.
There is Sumica
k
fak u chav
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
Canadian_Brony: Wait, were you here yesterday?
u wish u cud
nite lunasguard and hi Sumica
;D
Canadian_Brony: Or here for last BMN?
00,10yeah been here, just playing dundef
What marathons have you streamed?
00,10pony eps
/me nestles against Kandarihu. =..=
hey guys heres a joke a telemarketer called me and i said "Gregs crematorium, you kill em we grill em!" and he just said "uuh...." and hung up
eww ponies
Hey Kurra
Guessing no one has done a Doctor marathon
Jmo: ikr?
Sumica, DunDef? Aaaaa that game, love it
/me watches Life of Brian while lurking
Who'd like those.
AJIsAwesome wasn't here yesterday and missed most of BMN. Yes, I am aware that Luna was here. Yes, I follow her blog. Yes, something inside me died when I realized she was here and I didn't get to talk to her. Yes, I am aware you probably weren't going to ask these questions.
00,10it's the one year aniversary of it today Kurra
MOvie trilogies, pony eps (usually around a new season), and occaisionally they'll get on a Watch Phase4 Make a really silly rocket and crash" jag.
00,10free dlc for it too
:O!
I was also here for her birthday
Canadian_Brony: When you say talked, you mean a nice conversation with them?
Ugh, I'm in a bind right now. I need to move out of my apartment and back home with my family because I can't afford to pay my rent any more, but I can't get out of my lease and my roommate moved out before we got to talk about the whole situation
Tonight, an Obama telemarketer called me and I just told TO THE MOON and hung up :3
Canadian_Brony: okay. Just wanted to say that NewDCD was here yesterday.
Sabershy or atleast say "hi" and ask how they are
. . .
FFUUUUUUUUU-
>_>
Kurra: Nice...
Creative.
What is?
I don't like any candidate very much really, but I signed up for the do not call list...
And of course my computer mouse died on me tonight...
I could've scratched 2 off my list in a single weekend..
and it's not really creative, I shoulda sent them to the moon with a crate of bananas
Abe Lincoln for president
Good thing I have a laptop and the mouse was just a wireless one
Kurra: Sadly, the Do Not Call list doesn't exclude political calls or surveys. Why, I really don't know.
So, creative mode came out today for the xbox version of Minecraft...
lolxbox
lol Jmo
:3
/me slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
lolayejay

ohai DashWithRainbows
ohai Canadian_Brony
Jmo: .......
I tried remaking the cabin from Evil Dead, but the xbox version doesn't have placable mob spawners in creative mode yet...
Joomay Daru will not be pleased with that.
Ahahahaha
Jmo: What do you mean by "taking me to bed", exactly? :S
completely forgot about this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ-nAsk4UYw&feature=endscreen&NR=1
obviously to tie you down and leave you there
Too funny.
DashWithRainbows: OH you! :P
That's what I'd do to a lot of people
Weak chav.
Sorry if I have grammatical or spelling errors. I had to turn my laptop's touch pad back on since my wireless mouse died on me. Not the batteries, the actual mouse just stopped responding.
lolwireless
>Wireless mouse
Canadian_Brony: I fucking <3 Whose Line. They need to make new episodes of it.
PAHAHA
lol Jmo
Why!?
People and their wireless
DashWithRainbows: Because. :3
wireless mouse= my hamster last week :'(
That is not a valid reason, AJ.
Yes it is. :3
Dj_Cyber-4G: D:
Eddmario IKR? They kinda rebooted it with "Drew Carey's Improv-a-Ganza", but it wasn't as funny and lasted only 1 season.
You want a valid reason? cuz u suk dwr

so stop yer complainin'.
a telemarketer called me and i said "Gregs crematorium, you kill em we grill em!" and he just said "uuh...." and hung up
DashWithRainbows: What's wrong with using a wireless mouse? I have a laptop. If it was a desktop I'd use a wired one. I've never heard of that show Canadian_Brony
neva
/me levitates herself with magic into a bean bag chair and reads Harry Potter
What isn't wrong with a wireless mouse?
Dj_Cyber-4G: you just repeated that one

So, why no stream right now? Are the mods busty:
/me has been here since 9:30ish
Jmo x DWR OTP :3
Busty
>Busty
Eddmario: Our mods are INCREDIBLY busty
ROFL.
Turns out even the male mods have boobs.
:D
lolwut
Eddmario the mods need to take a break between streams, bro. Be patient and mod will pick it up eventually.
Oh my god my lungs.
Boobstate.net
^
And then the mods were busty. This is now canon.
Petrified_Discord: I have FLuttershy as my current GPS voice, since it's the only one available for Garmin right now.
:D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=Dz5Jeme5EMQ&NR=1

Polydunami, randomness
"because it is hard finding a man of that calibre..." :D
Jmo DashWithRainbows and I thought getting shipped with a chair was bad.
Eddmario: I'd like to say that I knew that was already a thing, but I didn't :D

Hi pony_666
hi pony_66......6 um i just realized something
13dwr knows :3
Every other ship is only capable of grabbing the title of "Second best ship"
I thought it was Shizuka X Vivi X Lyra` X rain?
Dj_Cyber-4G: what?
And this was all because my keyboard misspelled busy because it needs to be cleaned...
ew.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjf9J-aAGMk&feature=related
13no it is vivi x luna x canary x rain x me
Dj_Cyber-4G no it isn't. It's actually 616
Oh mai
Shizu X Dvorak keyboard = AAAA oh hayseed where's the H and X and U keys aaaaa *runs off the keyboard*
Jmo and DWR is SECOND best ship. :3
13sometimes shortened to vivi x me
Oh my god ayejay.
I thought s was far enough from t to not register :S
AJIsAwesome Nope.

otakon x everything is always funny
/me X anyone willing to snuggle with me, honest ;_;
^
I'd rather forfeit shipping :|
DashWithRainbows: i thought it was Neil X Yahoz
Meh, it was only funny because of his reaction.
DerpyMuffins well DUH
DerpyMuffins, not for ot
You guys know what's an awesome ship?
since greeks and hebrew dont have number symbols they use letters
Scootachicken is Neil.
ASoftFluffyThing: What?
