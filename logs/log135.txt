13Theyre working on putting on a post show right now
applejack...
but his evil laugh is good
lol but still.. curiosity + a room of people (would have been anyway)
and thus FLuttershy loved and tolerated him!

Stay awesome
Rarity.

This looks like its gonna be a spoiler-town fora while. I'm out.
Or else!
Welp
DONT CALL ME THINGS I DONT KNOW THE MEANING OF

They're replaying it tomorrow and Monday too I think.
*Seeing
kthxbai!
but it's official
My guess he's got a limited amount of omnipotence. As soon as he got out, he instantly knew.
they're marketing to us now
of course he nailed it
trolololololol
he played that role for how many years? :P
Someone actually said that in the EqD comments
now I need to check Treehouse TV to see if the episode they advertise is actually a later s2 episode
Them being used on him?
you didint see it yet?
THat would explain it.
it says the title is "Trinidad Stilts"
No
omniscience, sorry
I missed the livestream.
awww :(
right?
MIB talks like a politician
0Some stay dry an' other feel the pain!~
same but i watched it somewhere else
Is there any more stream anywhere?
LOL
lol
Maybe it was Pinkie's Earth Pony magic that allowed her hair to be straight.
they won't
9do you guys get signal?
I have a link
Hopefully
no
Not till season 5
um, is the brodcast off line?
G7 mabye
main screen stays off
One thing, before I sleep.
Yes
it is
i drank a whole pot of coffe forpony
not because of me. Maybe SOMEBronies aren't doing their part
oh, ok then
no
i see clouds
Speaking of wingboners...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81gU8-oEwoc
no
Main screen turn on.
30 yr old trekies like me?
I see rainclouds
working on 27 hours of no sleep
I like wingboners
www.facebook.com/RDWingboner
no stimulants whatsoever
xD
JUST PONY
Like my page please =D
we not get signal
he's not quite god-level yet, but in a world where magic is real, he's certainly as close as one can get. Compare to Celestia and Luna with god-level magic powers (raising the sun, etc)
Eeenope.avi
4Fancy.
now that they know the adults like it, more fanservice
Seconded
ahaha wing boners
Pony doesn't count as a stimulant?
Ponies are enough to stimulate brain waves
that episode though
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Bye, though.
just bumped Celestia down my power tier a bit
No
I have a feeling season 2 won't be "as good"
none
We missed S2! :(
Poines == Simulants?
Pegasis
I can't believe I just said that
4Yeah
4sorry
I fellasleep on the keybored
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7uWBHrhX3M
and watch pony
stimulants such as energy drinks and coffee
inb4 insomnia enduced stroke.
I can talk to Fluttershy?
just give me the go when you switch them all
sure
^Please
lemme go get her
anyone know where I can catch season 2 ep 1??

*a
hopefully
Rewatching some of S1 showed me that there were some problems with a few episodes

I didn't see any severe errors in this one
ponycurious xD
You gonna air the season 2 premiere?
My name should clue you in on that ;)
and awesome
i like ponyies
I felt this episode had a REALLY fast pace to it
I fear the show might lose some of it's lightheartedness
I'm not talking about animation
it did actually
Fwried: Really? I felt like they kind of wasted time
then again they HAVE to go fast
I'm talking about plot and characters and such
i was like hey not that bad
if they want to pack all this into two parts
yeah I see that
its awesome basicaly
Plot holes? In MY My Little Pony?
it felt like they were sort of bouncing
I AM A MAN! A MAN MAN MAN MAN
yeah, agreed, some of the characters kinda went slightly OOC at times
near the end it slowed down but in the beginning it was ultra fast
I've never been really girly
<---A.K.A "Bad Horse"!
lol
I uhh get called names but whatever ponies ftw right?
AAAAAAAAAAH
oh yes
Look Before You Sleep always felt a bit off to me
Ok everypony
lol
and then they HAD to recap
BRING IT

Here it is
You get up and go to school on monday

Episode 2 was rediculously fast
but is it too fast for the girls?
Let me know when You get it
Yeah.
9guys brb
Pegasisters...
when does season 2 air?
they could have put more in
Wing-slap
I think part of it because they didn't have to introduce everyone. We KNOW the ponies, let's get to the story.
UR A MAN!
1/0?
Hello?
Hnnng
exactly
but they recapped pretty hard here
(two people acknowledged me. See? I'm a genius)

um
FFFFUUUUUUUU
Sorry, couldn't resist. :P
String or nothing
oh, it's Twilight!

Grr...no one is streaming the episode right now.

It's hard hiding this shit.
6Hey! :D

I just divided by zero

No, but I think they announced that it would be a twoparter. :P
Fluttershy!
Harder than hiding porn <_>

i know 2, close friends of mine

I think my little pony is cooler than twilight

Durr
It makes me think my computer screen's dirty.

Do you have a crush on Rarity?
9obviously, the problem we had earlier
0sure
9was the channel
I might tell CNN though
I like Rarity! : ]
9fucking owncast
a
but older physically or mentally?
jiggly: pretty sure women like that are part of the target audience, although not the *stated* target audience
PSHAW
xD
I like her too
):
I win
0better tel FOX
4DAT'S OWNCAST!
right
4: D
I'll have another riddle for everypony next week. It's time for me to disappear, I'll let my friend crono_flash take over in my place
Mazinkaiser SKL is ok, but I prefer normal Mazinkaiser
I'd say that older physically.
owncast is worst cast
Rarity is good, she's just my least favorite of the mane 6
0They loooooove ponies
lol
My school would think it's "gay"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXqPeKrxBjg
well that was fun
Pinkie Pie
and then he said i like this
we just call her Pinkie Pie
Ponies?
I like all ponies. Choosing a favorite is hard in that it implies I like any of them less.
PONIES
Same. :(
WHENS THE NEXT STREAM
Broadcast offline.
It's harder I think to market to the mentalities of individuals unless they are already established.
all ponies are best ponies
maybe
Damn
Say, scifi fans.
LOL
x_
How is raven like a writing desk?
x_x
I know
Thats the only riddle I know.
How did everyone like my friend Discord's riddle?
Little girls are just that, little girls.

Trixie needs backstory
I think she would be fun to mess with
pinkie pie or fluttershy
i want episode 2 now i finished watchign epuside 1 #:P
Trixie would say, "anything you can do, I can do better!"
They ALL need backstory, really.
I saw a backstory of Trixie in EQD
and I'd be like "ORLY"
hmm
Rye: YES!!!!!!!
and then I'd die
