but nope
next week
i was watching ponycountdown.com whole the time
Discord's VA has a sexy voice
Mwahahahaha
irssi users, /ignore -channels #bronystate * JOINS PARTS QUITS NICKS
sit on the thrown
Fact: Fluttershy is best pony.
*throne
also, they mentioned luna but didn't show her
the one between trixie and Twighlit
wELL,
I was iffy on the first few minutes of it ("I stayed up 23 hours for THIS?) but as soon as discord showed up, I fell in love with it.
07time to hit the hay
watch everything go to shit
I guess I'll go back to lurking until a youtube link comes up..
filleg: flutterrump was sexier
John de Lancie. That's Q's actor.
YES, DISCORD'S VOICE IS AMAZING
I'll watch the first half when it goes on YT
SRSLY, why is the stream offline? or is it just me?
GURREN LAGANN MOVIE?
alright peeps... it was fun
07once again thanks for staying
Good, I missed the first episode.
gotta go
See you later.
right so what is she doing? having a few drinks while Luna tolerates drunk celestia.
HNNNNNNGH
Hey guys, what'd I miss?
Yes
till next saturday, and whenever i decide to show up in between then
It's over.
Luna: Why, you hungry :P
Now you know what we can do?
Sleep well, Luna!
All I need is 4 hours of slepe
0might as well. I'm already up
dang it, i always mispell that
Not fair in the least
and ponies.
That's why.
*YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO?*
/me Goodbye, Luna
Cya brony4life
Lots of ponies.
07Goodnight everypony
Wait.
is that MLP movie gonna be streamed any time today?
I anit even tired, what to do what to do............
later, Luna
WHAT?
fluttershy = fail
oh
uh...
also---hype for new york comic con
Epizooti: that's Q from TNG
Oh don't tell me I missed it
OPEN THE DOOR
What's the Episode's name?
Meteor
I sadly fell asleep during the marathon. :<
fluttershy is the only pony that resist his lies
No spoilers, please, but how was the first episode?
GET ON THE FLOOR
misspell*
you about to say "Cupcaaaaaaakes"?
Night…err…have a good day Luna
but it was repeating
*Twilight* there we go
Good night Luna!
trixe is the one who defeated an Ursa MAJOR may I remind you
Fact: Trixie is second-best villain
I thouroughly enjoyed the episode
It's funny how Celestia just stays there XD
EVERYBODY WALK THE DINOSAUR
07Thanks for staying with us
has to be
curezen fraid so
Oh 2hiit
Fact: One in six children are abducted by the Dutch.
But this means Discord has been imprisoned even longer than Luna
yep, Celestia knows how to defeat Discord since She defeated him once before, but didn't bother telling the mane 6 much background, just "time is of the essence, off you go"
We are never watching that G1 MLP movie.
Discord is an A-grade troll :D
4Like always, thank you for joining us. I'm gonna go hide in a corner...
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
AGAIN.
hope someone recorded it. I have to watch the full thing again
DAMN IT
waiting is so hard though, why don't we have a party
am i too late for the first episode?
EVEN.
it was... wonderful
*walks the dinosaur*
night, luna!
LETS DO THE TIME WARP
"It's up to you lul"
07Friendship is indeed Magic!
*facepalm*
A reshowing of the movies starts a 2 right?

ive had an erection for an hour now should i consult a doctor
Already?
I liked the episode, I had some problems with it, but it was very entertaining

now the "spoilers" on equastria daily make sense!
I liked what I saw, but I missed the first few minutes...
Umad?
That makes Luna and Celestia like, 10,000
gandalf wasn't omniscient too and neither is Celestia
I don't want to think of sexual ponies..
/me waves goodbye
Bye
*facegeound works too
goddamit chicken why youd release discord
16:05 here
No problem u guys ^^
Still too many people for it though?
Welcome to the herd.
0 7am here
Anodormy: You missed both showings of episode 1
How can anyone say they didnt like this episode?
ground*
13lol LordCelestia :3
I'm gonna be honest
I fell asleep right at the end of Over a Barrel
brb clopping to discord r34
>did not look at any spoilers
because Celestia is a gleeful troll. Discord is a malicious troll, like a 4chaner
bye
Like that
ahhhh
Okay ehm..
Bye everypony.
they lose all their sex appeal
when is the next broadcast?
when i first say discord's design
missed the show
good morning then
:B
whatever that was to begin with
i was unimpresed
Luna and spike has never happened before
>Celestia
Who youre favorite Pony?!
Sweetie Bell is a dictionary.
07:05 here.

>sex appeal
Minecraft time
duno Scootaloo
NO THERE BETTER NOT BE DISCORD R34

Hopefully the episode will be available on iTunes by tomorrow in glorious HD :D
13Theyre working on putting on a post show right now
applejack...
but his evil laugh is good
when is discord playing?
Bye bronies!
lol but still.. curiosity + a room of people (would have been anyway)
and thus FLuttershy loved and tolerated him!
just reembed the wild dance channel
a sec
voice was what really sold him as a villain
Stay awesome
Rarity.
but Q as the voice and the personality made me impressed.
you must be jokin pony
CMC Eternal Chaos Releasers ~yay!
This looks like its gonna be a spoiler-town fora while. I'm out.
Or else!
We have a chicken, a dictionary, and..... ?
Welp
DONT CALL ME THINGS I DONT KNOW THE MEANING OF
Its fucking Q
indeed
wow can anyone else believe the degree they went with this seems like someothing that would be taboo for childrens
agreed, Jon
which must suck being a god/wizard and not knowing everything
Derpy
rainbowdash
Now I need to decide
13I believe ep two is next week.
My point exactly
I fell asleep sometime after Look Before You Sleep.
Im more interested in learning more of Equestrias past before Celestia & Luna, is it like the 1st Fable where Jack of Blades ruled Albion before the rise of heroes?
next episode "I WANT IT NOWW!"
lol shadowLurker
Minecraft, or Civ 5?
Ok!
INB4 TWICORD FANFIC
RAINBOW DASH all the way
and man, it was super effective
Now to see if it's on youtube yet

but they still tend to show up at the right times
partially because shes orange
inb4 Discord x Pinkie

Inb4 pinkie serves discord at somepoint.
Hawt.
and season 1, episode 4 was very similar to me
Ive seen every episode like twice, so sleepiness got the best of me. but im really glad i woke up early to watch this
I don't know weather to be greatful or sick, ether way it will be chaotic. Just take a picl
Now to catch up with readings...
So did they release him based on their fighting?
hmmm. tough choice.
Morp: YES! THIS!
fluttershy is a tree scootaloo is a chicken and sweetibelle is a dictionary
If Discord is Q, does that make Celestia Picard?
i guess i am now Pissy Pie
just woke up and fount this
Well, Celestia doesn't have adorableness appeal, so what else?
fluttershy shows you kids how to deal with /b/trolls via Love & Tolerate

Ya
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
Hoo!
That recording has video lag.
niy2ko
that was fast
Serious question here; we all remember certain nightmare fuel from our childhoods; Do you feel this will create nightmare fuel for a future generation?
No. I am not falling for that.
/me pets dat Owl
Rawrity, agreed.
we see what it is
0I'm ten minutes into this episode. Derpy is now a main character
u be trollin, but not as well as Discord
Is it commercial-free?
EmeraldVision, i feel your pain... :(
I am not amused
nope
It's a goddamn RickRoll
yes nyst
Lol u mad
don't think so
nah
0well, I can try to salvage a few hours rest now, goodnight fellow bronies
and it's pretty laggy
no
that wasn't THAT scary
Don Bluth films are scary as fuck
4chan
Heh, nice!
its just the stream record
pinkie pie's bit was nightmare fuel.
Cherilee: "He has the head of a pony..."
I AM NOW MAD, LIKE FLUTTERSHY
The balloons will
@billaxle I have an idea!
probably for SOMEONE out there
turned in to 5chan
It's me again - the incorrect youtube link guy
I didn't watch it, so technically I was never RickRolled.
pinkie pie's bit was nightmare fuel. TRUST ME.
okay the balloons were pretty fucking creepy
DATS A HORSE
whatever, i'm staying right here
But still...
So, what's everypony's opinion of discord?
cause of discord
Figured. No way they could trim it up that fast.
discord = Q
Lol
Likable
Actually
untill its oficially on youtube
i actually don't remember nightmare fuel though
which is AWESOME
0So is the owl
Rafasde, evil fucker
I WAS RICKROLLED AS WELL
Discord is a master troll
actually nevermind dari
I didn't watch the video
Umad?
Also, rage
probably have to at least wait the day for higher quality stuff to trim and process
Excellent. Now's I can watch the beginning
discord is awesome
gonna use the HQ popout
Draconiquis
and i posted the link
?
Yeah I'm betting some kids are going to have balloon nightmares tonight
Hate and love.
:(
No...just dissapoint.
untill then i will post epic Pony Videos!
...
lol we need stephen coltbert to define victoriful.
Problem? :P
Billaxle http://www.youtube.com/user/pensivepony
I like how hes taking a whole different approach than NMM
He's amusing.
I'm with DSNesmith1
I love Discord utterly. He's a fantastic villain.
you will find it there
fluttershy was great tho
he IS Q
discord's great
NMM=Pure force Discord=Betrayal.
he cheats
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zHZj8Xp-Ik
Discord's no really SCARY, just a great villain. Well done FiM team.
...Question?
Thanks Nyst
By 8pm tonight
So now I have half of the switched and half of them not.
9guys
Sweetie Belle is a dictionary
8PM? ThATS 12 HOURS?
first word is aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
9see the High Quality Stream Popout button under the stream?
wheres Luna? did she die or something?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-LpZyq3G18
too long
9please click it.
also horn key wat
9we'll be streaming through there
And the HQ popout is a different channel to the Dance of Machine God one
Luna died and went to Troll heaven
And only some of the popouts are still that one.
so I wonder how many target demographic actually caught the show?
Thanks
where?
How does he know all about the ponies?He was trapped in stone.
/me does not click it.
They did a good job delivering him differently than NMM.
i.e, she was banished to the moon again
I'm just going to switch them all now DCD.
I don't see a button
Pop outs are awesome
see her in 3rd season
oh
Celestia's the troll
Q can't break the prime directive either, that's why he's not showing his true self
switch them
cuz there is a lot of mention of her in episode 1 on session 2
the target demographic was SCARRED FOR LIFE
no s2 spoilers please!
3Ah don't know.. but ah wanna watch it again.
mind you it was awesome to get up for Saturday morning cartoons again
9actually nevermind
wish I had a higher quality version of that Episode on Youtube ; 3;
Dude, it beets Not seing it at all
"-Discord's voice is ACE! Seriously, I'd never heard of John de Lancie before, but he NAILED it!" wut.
9we'll just stream normally
wow Trollestia
They're replaying it tomorrow and Monday too I think.
*Seeing
kthxbai!
new meme is a go
but it's official
SPOILER: TROLLING HAPPENS
the show is now for the bronies
My guess he's got a limited amount of omnipotence. As soon as he got out, he instantly knew.
I don't want spoilers. I did see that one-minute Discord clip, though...
they're marketing to us now
TROLLING
of course he nailed it
Great first episode, kept me on the edge of my couch. the anticipation lived up to the hype for me, in more ways than I expected. I love Pinkie Pie's thoughts on Discord's world vs Celestia Rule "Discord comes with chocolate rain. Chocolate RAIN!"
trolololololol
he played that role for how many years? :P
Maybe he has a connection to the elements?
Someone actually said that in the EqD comments
now I need to check Treehouse TV to see if the episode they advertise is actually a later s2 episode
Them being used on him?
guys teh writiers know luna demand is high if they show her too early they give up a full house early when they have a winning hand, there going to hold her in reserve till ratings drop
you didint see it yet?
THat would explain it.
bringing in Q, referencing memes... Hasbro knows where the money is
it says the title is "Trinidad Stilts"
No
omniscience, sorry
So basicly, shit happens, not that different from S1
I missed the livestream.
which I suspect to be some sort of error
awww :(
right?
MIB talks like a politician
0Some stay dry an' other feel the pain!~
same but i watched it somewhere else
Is there any more stream anywhere?
.implying the ratings will EVER drop, lol
It'd make sense Nyst. He seemed to know precisely what was happening to all of them at any given time, so...
LOL
lol
Maybe it was Pinkie's Earth Pony magic that allowed her hair to be straight.
they won't
9do you guys get signal?
I have a link
Hopefully
who else would they market for if they use Star Trek's Q for Discord
no
Not till season 5
omg the bronies and their wing boners
um, is the brodcast off line?
G7 mabye
main screen stays off
One thing, before I sleep.
Yes
it is
yeah but Euponytor, most of the episode was made before they knew of the Bronies
i drank a whole pot of coffe forpony
not because of me. Maybe SOMEBronies aren't doing their part
oh, ok then
no
no I don't DCD
i see clouds
Speaking of wingboners...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81gU8-oEwoc
no
Main screen turn on.
Nope
I find that difficult to believe, the bronies were out in force around episode.. what, three?
30 yr old trekies like me?
I see rainclouds
but still Q was freaking brilliant for Discord
working on 27 hours of no sleep
I like wingboners
www.facebook.com/RDWingboner
oh holy crap that ep was awesome
no stimulants whatsoever
RD gets them whenever I get them
xD
JUST PONY
Like my page please =D
actualyl that might have not worked out so well
we not get signal
he's not quite god-level yet, but in a world where magic is real, he's certainly as close as one can get. Compare to Celestia and Luna with god-level magic powers (raising the sun, etc)
Sup Trollestia
Eeenope.avi
Now, someone needs to make a video of all the mistakes in Season 2 ep1
0Is this bad if this video gave me a wingboner?
im back yo
4Fancy.
Sup.
now that they know the adults like it, more fanservice
Who's Q?
Seconded
Guess what, I was so tired I dreamt I was watching season 2. BUT I MISSED IT!!!
ahaha wing boners
Pony doesn't count as a stimulant?
DSNesmith1, you are true brony
um, are we gonna watch Giant Robots now?
For a few scenes, it looked like Rarity was missing her cutie mark after she was hypnotised. That might've been an interesting twist.
Ponies are enough to stimulate brain waves
I need to see that video...
that episode though
Q is the troll King
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
im a female brony? if that makes sense lol
Bye, though.
Indeed
just bumped Celestia down my power tier a bit
No
I have a feeling season 2 won't be "as good"
No. We will watch epic pony videos.
none
We missed S2! :(
Now we need a drawing of Twilight as Picard and Discord as Q.
Poines == Simulants?
@DSNesmith1 try a week of that, i done it, you hallucinate about ponies if you spend most of your time watching them
Q is a.. bigger troll.... than Celestia
but it will be great for different reasons
Pegasis
I can't believe I just said that
4Yeah
.... so
4sorry
I fellasleep on the keybored
if I don't sleep for a few days
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7uWBHrhX3M
No, it won't be "as good" because of nostalgia
dont worry you ididnt miss much.... just THE FREAKING BEST EPISODE EVER EVWER
CriticKitten; him being a puppetmaster (to the point of being literally protrayed as one) also suggests he's got an eye on everything.
but the fear is that it will attract more scorn from Hasbro
and watch pony
yes.Troll KING > troll princess
stimulants such as energy drinks and coffee
what Sol said
inb4 insomnia enduced stroke.
I have a feeling that it wont be "as good", itll be better!
I love that video
I can talk to Fluttershy?
just give me the go when you switch them all
it will hit youtube in no-time :P
Q is the original troll
sure
^Please
Am i the only female here? im just wondering because every other person ive met that likes ponies is a male
Yeah, so omniscience makes sense.
lemme go get her
anyone know where I can catch season 2 ep 1??
maybe
I'm s female
*a
hopefully
Rewatching some of S1 showed me that there were some problems with a few episodes
http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/17328113
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYaEITlCQRg
YAY!
No, Flutterbro13, (Ponies === Stimulants).
he was troll'n before the internet was popular
9mib: we have a recordi-
im male but im also ponycurious
9beat me to it
I'm female. :)
newDCD put a link
mib_0ubwm4: Use that link
you're brain literally starts to stop gathering external data and in an attempt to hold your perception together starts creating things to fill in the gaps
Sol there were SEVERE animation errors in some of the episodes
I didn't see any severe errors in this one
ponycurious xD
that sounds terrifying
So many ppl with no names d:
You gonna air the season 2 premiere?
My name should clue you in on that ;)
and awesome
i like ponyies
I felt this episode had a REALLY fast pace to it
DSN, after that, you would be able to talko to flatershy while riding on RD to fight of a giant panda
I fear the show might lose some of it's lightheartedness
I'm not talking about animation
it did actually
Staght up Brony Colt here
Fwried: Really? I felt like they kind of wasted time
0@derpy: This is what you get for watching manly shows
i first watched it with my baby cousin but then i started watching it
Can the panda be on fire.
but I know all too well that the fun stuff only comes after a day or two of feeling like absolute shit
then again they HAVE to go fast
well flash cant be that easy to animate some of teh stuff they did
....that sounds pretty cool to me. >_>
Owlowiscious ninja powers activate!
I'm talking about plot and characters and such
i was like hey not that bad
so pretty much your imagiantion starts bleeding over into reality
if they want to pack all this into two parts
<--Glorious Stallion!
Nah, I'm female too. :B Very tomboyish, but yeah.
new meme? victoryful
yeah I see that
its awesome basicaly
Plot holes? In MY My Little Pony?
it felt like they were sort of bouncing
that won't be a problem until I call my professor Cheerilee
I AM A MAN! A MAN MAN MAN MAN
yeah, agreed, some of the characters kinda went slightly OOC at times
near the end it slowed down but in the beginning it was ultra fast
I've never been really girly
<-- Colt .45
<---A.K.A "Bad Horse"!
lol
Anyone up for a quick riddle?
I uhh get called names but whatever ponies ftw right?
AAAAAAAAAAH
oh yes
well they had to get the characters to canterlot in a hurry
YES SIR
Look Before You Sleep always felt a bit off to me
Ok everypony
lol
and then they HAD to recap
BRING IT
sure
Here it is
hell to the yes
"I lied at the beginning, Hated laughing next, I toke something that was useless, and was not nice about it. I left my friends and broke the rules. There's only one left and it's a snap. The two answer, but only one is right. " Who am I?
You get up and go to school on monday
/me opens his wings
they got to keep in mind their pacing
they *HAD* to recap.
my body is ready
COME AT ME BRO
Ponies.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN2U5wkhRWc
Isn't that like, god what was his name, so tired...that greek guy in the cave that couldn't tell what was reality and what were shadow?
B] Awesome ponies.
Damn.. I knocked out.
making sure the clothes are correctly facing
so whens this thing start?
Season 2?
you have a teacher called Cheerilee suddenly
WHAT do you do.
hello?
I try to keep the brony stuff to myself and my friends.
When i say Po- you say Nies
I should really publish the results of that survey I did. :|a
what is it they call pony high fives? brohoof? xD
I missed the new episode by an hour
Po
nies
hmmmmm
discord CELESTIA!
:brohoof:
BROHOOF
EAT CUPCAKE
:3
Gotta mind those intimate details.
and then they had to deal with corrupting five ponies
ask is she is a brony.
idk
omgomgomgomgromgomgomgogmogmomgomgomgomg
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDHAp1zG7Y
Paint her lavender and draw on her flank
I thought the pacing for this episode was actually better than, say, Episode 2's
BROHOOF
Celestia?
Anything that has cloppy MLP characters is basically if you break the line between cute and porn and let it bleed out onto your computer screen. You don't know if it's the most fucked up thing ever or really freakin' cute. I try to avoid that circumstance.
all in 22 minutes
if not then tell her to change her name
And send ED a big thank you card, once I uh. Draw up the art.
will they be playing it again today?
Bruhuf
brohoof anyone???
Episode 2 was rediculously fast
well, for bronies, I dont know what they would call it for pegasises
dari you're just missing Twi, huh?
but is it too fast for the girls?
if they had 28 minutes or so
brohoof! :o
Let me know when You get it
Yeah.
9guys brb
Pegasisters...
when does season 2 air?
they could have put more in
Plato's Cave. Thanks Google.
Wing-slap
I think part of it because they didn't have to introduce everyone. We KNOW the ponies, let's get to the story.
I don't like it as much as brony.
true
UR A MAN!
true
1/0?
Hello?
0pegasis souds better
by man, I mean brony
Hnnng
exactly
but they recapped pretty hard here
I always thought Bronies was a general term, gender didnt matter...
(two people acknowledged me. See? I'm a genius)
also I have a feeling that the 2 parter is more for us anyway
at least thats what i was told
um
I like Brony. I just thinks it's gender neutral
FFFFUUUUUUUU
Sorry, couldn't resist. :P
That's what I think
9much better
String or nothing
NewDCD: All switched
oh, it's Twilight!
and the regular season is for everybody
Gender neutral
Well, I'll be going you guys
2 parter? Don't you mean 3 parter?
0brony is genderless
ANYONE CAN BE MY BRO!
Aww.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSrBbsSu4XI
Anyone know when flankbook will be back up? I wanna post... stuff...
Does anypony knows when episode 2 is out??
LETS DANCE
That's very much possible Jigglysaint. And Euponytor, stop pushing it. :P
eh, I guess it would work
another massive trollface.jpg
Sol check your PM's
This is how i feel about whoever/whatever caused me to miss S2!
I'm a brony and proud just saying lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozDvkBe2rdg
Alrighty then
allow me to send you away with style
Well, the first six statements each refer to the individual element ponies.
I just was about to post a vid for us going into season 2.
0at least wiki says so
someone knows if will be another replay?
Don't divide by zero.
Can I link it anyways?
Next Caterday, same time
they COULD you know
11Hello, everyone
/me hugs RAWRity goodnight.... well, good morning.
Grr...no one is streaming the episode right now.
I hope so
My mom doesn't know I'm into ponies...
make it a 3 parter
Jigglysaint, you mean Everypony right?
/me launches RAWRity out of the Chat room via the MOON cannon
it's not like they're gonna tell us in advance
It's hard hiding this shit.
my mom does..
6Hey! :D
yeah
Thats a answer but the the right one, ThePretender.
My mom does. She's cool with it.
@alexann , my dad was the first to know
I just divided by zero
so, when is mecha gpnna start?
at least have them leave in style, heeheee ^^
lol
No, but I think they announced that it would be a twoparter. :P
lol at LordCelestia
Fluttershy!
well, that's quite the send off! Great night guys, even if I will be paying for it all day!
Harder than hiding porn <_>
But I'm a big animation doof, so. XD
My mom would laugh at me.
Wait
I told my family, I just don't care what they think about it
What
My dad dont givafuck
All my friends and family do, and love it too. LOLS.
Nobody knows, except for me and everyone else on the internet.

It's 10:21
9make sure you have stream feed then
I was astounded by the rating MLP has on IMDb, to be honest. :P
I'll have to take a look when I get home tomorrow
4That's a good point, why the fuck was Discord propped up in someone's garden?
I get it. You're Discord.
simple question, the mod's mentioned yesterday something about giant robot movies, is that happening?

Your getting closer, that's one of my answers, but still not it.
i'm responsible for converting several my friends into bronies
lol
Venom OPS
and if that's the case, then that means that it's possilbe to archive the entire season perhaps before it even ends
At least if I have to tell my mom sometime, it's not inappropriate or anything...
Farewell season 1.Onto the future.
who knows, we're never all in the same spot except on EQD
we had AT LEAST six FULL channels of bronies JUST HERE
I'm trying to convince a friend on steam to give it a try, but his reaction to is has been...rather allergic.
Nine Twenty three in Chicago, illinois
I'll click any mediafire link posted lol
I converted two of my RL friends to the show
hello
I turned at least 10 friends online into bronies
but I don't know how many of the new season they produced already
Im back

Is that it?
sorry
9TELL me if there's any lag
One of them was a dude, and I showed him the Fluttershy clip from Best Night Ever
Discord trolled u
i'm currently in the process of converting my freind
The channel I started on had like 5,000 viewers.
damit
Discord is the one controlling each of them like marionettes. Twilight is the only one left for him to conquer.
What are we firing up? :0
KK
whats going on?
sorry
I've got my closest friends to watch the show, and one of them is converted.
@darkrook i turned 17 of my Real friends into bronies
just press play, NewDCD
wow jon, thanks for that video
One more hint, The mane 6 are the users of what
okay, ill post it in big red letters if theres any lag
So he got curious and watched the rest. Then he converted his sister.
Hah, my estimate was dead-on then
I TURNED U INTO A STFU
is it working?
its like pulling teeth, but it'll be worth it
NewDCD: What are you doing?
Hi :) :)
;(
5k bronies was my initial guess
Just hit play bro
but you cant go to any forum without seeing at least one brony
I'm attempting to convert my one friend
wow
he's streaming Mazinkaiser?
Lets do dis
9already did
0 2 rocks fight for Rarity's love
Hoo!
Or outside...
Elements of Disharmony
Successful converters, tell me your secret! How do you get them to try it out?
You're welcome DSN.
i couldnt get any sleep from the thunderstorm :( just woke up
It was fun watching his reactions to the episodes. So much laughter XD
I told her it was cooler than twilight and she said we'll see
@darkrook its ok, its ok, here, have a cookie

NewDCD: stream frozen then?
lol its very tricky
Oh wait, read that wrong.

Alright, I need food badly. Take care all, and thank you bronystate
9oh wow
neither stream is doing anything
9give me a second
Theres a smudge in the middle
i know 2, close friends of mine
thats bugging me.
I think my little pony is cooler than twilight
of course that's because I haven't been able to ask some of my friends
OH MY GOD A GIANT ROCK
I love that video
Durr
It makes me think my computer screen's dirty.
obviously
One converted me, the other I converted with my friend
send that smudge to the moon, i must
Twilight is retarded
RAINBOW EMP INBOUND
: P
I basically showed him some funny clips from the show and then let him watch some episodes.
HATE IS OFFLINE
yes yes it is
the movies/books, not character
though I wonder if a person has the mind of a little child, if they are considered a brony or not
LOL ANGEL JUST GREW LONG LEGS
/me launches smudge to the moooooon.
9live!
I like Twilight Sparkle
she is my #2 pony
He started with the pilot, but I know that it's not the most representative of the show. He enjoyed it, though.
damn, i thought i was doing good with converting 5, but one of them is in a heavy metal garage band, so that gets a bonus, right?
I like rainbow dash and applejack
Rainbow and Twilight are my favorites.
clicking play....
It seems most bronies I know of were nerds already.
I like POnies
like if your self concept is a 5 year old girl, even if you have massive cleavage, would be be considered brony or target?
LAG
Rainbow Dash and Twilight are my favorites too
AWW YES
/me 4is also clicking play
in general
We get signal
9...as expected
I converted the principle of my high school
/me brohoofs /Alexann
9give me a moment
Rainbow Dash is my favorite, but I like all the ponies.
Fuck is...?
its skipping
I win
THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME
but is lag
GUYS! Can you keep a secret?!?
the smudge is a plane
*brohoof*
gravity abnormalities?
LAG
i just got here, whats this?
AWW YEAH
a brony is merely an older fan
MECHA TIME, HOO
LAG
mehbe
Do you have a crush on Rarity?
9obviously, the problem we had earlier
/me hits play. Nothing happe--oh finally! yay
0sure
9was the channel
I might tell CNN though
I like Rarity! : ]
9fucking owncast
a
but older physically or mentally?
9choosing the WORST moments to lag like hell
lolz
jiggly: pretty sure women like that are part of the target audience, although not the *stated* target audience
PSHAW
the principle of my high school now comes to school with a brony T shirt on.
xD
I like her too

I win
0better tel FOX
Still a lil bit oflag
4DAT'S OWNCAST!
right
4: D
I'll have another riddle for everypony next week. It's time for me to disappear, I'll let my friend crono_flash take over in my place
Mazinkaiser SKL is ok, but I prefer normal Mazinkaiser
I'd say that older physically.
owncast is worst cast
Rarity is good, she's just my least favorite of the mane 6
Lucky you, DerpyHooves.
0They loooooove ponies
lol
so physical age then
no, i think the worst moment to lag like hell would've been during season 2 ponies
Who wants a cookie?
My school would think it's "gay"
i got caught on youtube at school
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXqPeKrxBjg
oh OwnCast... you were so tempting with your high resolution capabilities
of the main cast i like pinkamina diane pie the most :D
well that was fun
and he told me to show him what i was on
Pinkie Pie
because I know a severely mentally challenged woman who would love this stuff
and then he said i like this
we just call her Pinkie Pie
Ponies?
I'm so going to be ready for that next riddle
I like all ponies. Choosing a favorite is hard in that it implies I like any of them less.
broadcast offline :l
if she hasn't already started watching it
PONIES
Same. :(
WHENS THE NEXT STREAM
now he has a pinkie pie bobble head and a brony t shirt
discord might scar her too
Broadcast offline.
It's harder I think to market to the mentalities of individuals unless they are already established.
all ponies are best ponies
maybe
Damn
HURR I wonder what Dr. Whoof humanized would look like :p
Say, scifi fans.
Pinkamena is just the term we use for :( Pinkie. WHO WILL FUCK UR SHIT UP
Dr. Who
so many people coming and going
LOL
x_
How is raven like a writing desk?
x_x
dr whooves lol
they need to start making discord toys now
These starting episodes for both seasons are a bit dark
I know
Thats the only riddle I know.
How did everyone like my friend Discord's riddle?
Little girls are just that, little girls.
I'm waiting here for when S2 is on Youtube Konngman.
but the new season isn't out in Canada yet
but i like em
I LOVE DERPY <3
I think I butchered it too.
But humanized he'd look like Dr. Who
Poe wrote on both.
Of course
Discord was best on Fluttershy

LordCelestia, let the master of puns handle this
/me walks off the stage in shame
OwnCast? More like OwnedCast
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xegHN1AU-WQ
9and JUST before the stream it decided to fuck up
*ahem*

9I can't believe our luck

I was disappointed about how strict they seemed to be about "bad" behavior.
WOOOT
DAMMIT, FREEZEFRAME I WAS GONNA SAY THAT
U A DICTIONARY?
yeah
theres a poor recording somewhere
But thanks for the link
w/ comercials
then again, perhaps it's better
OwCast... was PwnedCast
Wait it already aired?
yes
shhhhhh i'm watching ponies :D
Hey guys, no ei label for this epi
creativity does work well within limits
yeah
So some things like this episode make me wonder what the lines are.
Well, Discord is fucking awesome, hands down
/me laments being too slow.
you want link?
about an hour ago
jesusnipples you're 1:30 late
so that only means that the jokes need to be more cleaver
if that's alright with mods lol
I need to look up those exercises the director told me about
no easy way out
only will post link if mods say its ok
Oh wow, This is amazing
YESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYSEYSYESYESYESYS!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU!!!!
Essay
Are new episodes always at 6am?
I HATE ESSAYS
the ads are cut out, and the logo's are gone as well? This is an amazing job!
Fuck. Will they be airing it again today or was that it?
but I like that they have to be careful
11Sorry that I've been gone too long
THE BUTTERFLYS
O.O
THER IN MEA TUMMAH
I think it would have been cool for Discord to talk in Shakespearian meter.
If all of S2 has no ei, it will be interesting
indeed
after all, that's where part of the charm is
this was fast
I approve
that it's not like other cartoons
Well...at least in my timezone?
you can find a recording somewhere
/me brohoofs whoever made this
^nah

Rainbow Dash I love you. 3.3

it doesn't have to adhere to "educational and informational" standards
There's a statue of Octavia with an oboe
*REAL* Shakespearean iambic pentameter, or that overly dramatic Thespian crap?

4Unless the links are relevant, DashWithRainbows

Most likely.

ghosties, it's s2ep1 apparently
05http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x012BnKWi3g&feature=related

Fluttershy is cuteasfuck

I have a sudden urge to go watch TNG
Iambic pentameter is really hard for to wrap my brain around
its been split into 2 vids
someone say god bless you. im sneezing like crazy. HELP!
in a time where children's shows are scruitinized to make sure it's not just eye candy
anybody know where i can watch the s2 ep anywhere?
person is uploading second vid as we speak
lol Q as a human i remember that
true
Applejack is... well... loyal
Celestia bless you, LordCelestia
4I don't have a problem with it, other mods might
what stream is used? The Last Resort?
remember the plate of fruit in the G3.5 opening?
9GUYS
OMG
I don't like Applejack that much.
THE FAILSAFES HAVE FAILED

WE ARE ALL DOOMED
:D:D:D:DD:DD::

G3.5 represents what would have happened if Nightmare Moon took over
9just pop it out in a windo-
I avoided all things not G4. Enlighten me.
9LOL
Can you imagine the corrupted mane6 going loose in Ponyville?
9just get in where dari said
9that's better
Y u no read chat DCD? :P
i avoid the earlier gens
Pinkie Pie is a sugar coated saviour in a time of snack food censorship
(╯°□°）╯彡┻━┻
haha, nice
And so the mane6 ventured into a new land, known as Ponibooru
from what i hear, they never happened
guys, Ill be back later
She fights for trans fats!
well in the G3 opening, Sweetie Belle had a plate of cookies
9is everypony ready?
I gotsta go somewhere
since she's the baker of the group
NOTHING WE CANT OVERCOME
WTF IS THAT?
errr
EZCEPT DISCORD
┬──┬ ﻿ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
DCD, is it alright if someone posts a link to S2EP1 on youtube?
in 3.5, it was changed to a plate of fruit and a glass of milk
anybody know the link to the first part of the ep on youtube?
good luck with the streaming NewDCD and everyone else
wow.
The best way to stop the evil 6 is to just let them on 4chan or something.

9it's alrigh
9okay
it's on ustream
What.
9Starting!
yes
9is everyone ready?
k dash doit
but i want all of mods permission before posting link
WUT DA FUCK! HOW THEY GET TO CANTERLOT SO FAST
How strict can you be?
a041744, with the exception of a few rarely used contractions, iambic pentameter is *supposed* to sound like natural talking
ye
DEEESERT
480p versions of the Season 2 Episode 1 now available at Equestria Daily!
yup
he just gave you permission wow
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xegHN1AU-WQ4
Yo, man, flip that switch!

9SWITCH FLIPPED
Magic
there
o-o
now its creepy baloon party!
if it loads...
THEN WHERE THE FUCK IS LUNA
it's like cookies was Rule 34 incarnate
Well, Discord did NOT disappoint. AT ALL!
The show itself is over-the-top sweet. Why would a plate of cookies scare anyone?
Corn? This is the first time I've seen AJ harvest something other then apples
FLIPPING SWITCHES
but thats much less disturbing than a plate of cookies
bingo
He is FUCKING AWESOME!
9Is it running?
yup
Yes
9well?
@darkrook idk moon, or being cutie mcsad pants
it's running
It'd be nice to see her harvesting souls.
STOP DAT DISCORD
9no lag?
Smooth and sexy, DCD
we get signal
6How come you have?
yes lag
before this episode i had never seen celestia walk
9awesome

G4 Pinkie Pie, advocate for all future diabetics everwhere
nor me

....Undying?
Frendship

I'm glad we have G4 stuff now. Where the creators aren't afraid to show a pony guzzling down chocolate rain.
Victoryful?
CHOCOLATE rAIN
...What?
HUMAN SMEGMA
I still have no lag.
CHOCOLATE! RAIN!
CHOCOOOLAAAT RANNN

I SEE FIRE AND I SEE PAIN

9okay

AND THEN DISCORD DIED
THE END
so did my link work?
LOL DISCORD U TROLLER
BRACE YOUR SPHINCTERS!
brace your sphincters everpony
That's where real parenting comes in.
if it didnt just do pop-up
DAMN YOU PINKIE
Giant robot time?
maybe if I close the window with chat..
And not tv babysitting.
but yeah, it just bugs me that food gets censored in a cartoon
lmao.
The pop-up thing again? Oh well
lol
Real parenting: when your dad explains to you who Q is
insertion ho!
prepare for insertion...
yes I am aware of the obesity epidemic
brace your sphincters for secret butt fun.
My dad would've done that...
^
He MISSED U CELESTIA
66 hours till 2?No wonder these guys are so down.
NOW TROLL WITH HIM, FOREVER
9BRACE YOUR SPHINCTERS is now a meme
and ever, and ever
in fact, my theory is that I wouldn't be obese myself if I had a better relationship with food
now i need to sign into youtube, and favourite episodes for later reference
What's going on? Season Two should already be up, right??
bits of s2e01 reminded me of this arc from Jack: http://www.pholph.com/whole_arc_viewer.php?id=5&sid=1375
66 till season 2*
Man, these curtains are...heavy.
11The site has been down a lot lately
YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH
that is, be allowed to fantasize about eating cookies
where are you watching it now? the stream isnt on for me
...ok, I'm back
but how's your relationship with exercise Jiggly
ELECTRIC DRILL LAZER.
Yes.
well
6>.<
I'm not active per se
They don't talk much...
hey
WHERE WAS DISCORD WHEN YOU DON'T SIMPLY BRACE YOUR SPHINCTERS INTO GRUNDLELAND
lolllllll
It reminded me a bit of that one early arc from Soul Eater.
9SCARLET ;___;
though I get everwhere by bus
I was never on good terms with exercise either though...
since I don't drive
lol I get it, he's called Scarlet because he's bleeding. ....wait, that's not funny. :(
LOL STANDING ON DAT HEAD
...That drill ship thing failed.
what is this btw???
okay I think I better go for a long bike ride or something, you guys are scaring me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xegHN1AU-WQ
9*she
I always found excersise for excercise sake to be hard
looks awesome
9and it's Mazinkaiser SKL
hard as in not keeping my attention
lol head stading i missed that the first time
*she, then. :P
Oh, a bike ride is fun.
11Hey
9it's pretty much combat porn
9so enjoy
o.o
jiggly: GO OUTSIDE and exercise
but I try not to shy away from activity if invited
Yay now we're stuck alone in a battle with no one to help us!
porn... and combat?
But my bike is currently out of comission.
CELESTIA WTF?
Stream doesn't work
Wait porn?
9no, more like porn OF combat
Shield throw ftw
WHO DONT YOU GO WITH THEM
AARGH!
...Porn of combat what?
and I have a sudden craving for popcorn
actually it's funny, but I get excercise in the grocery store
Oh, that's better
11I'm just currently working on the world pages for the second game
lol BRACE YOUR SPHINCTERS for combat porn,
SAme here Patrtap

JESUS, YOU ARE WORSE THAN CORNELIUS AND HIS FUCKING RHEUMATISM
GAREN?

I forgot to brace it
10ok
Haha, it's the perfect cover.
9someone post the backup stream link pronto!
candy coated popcorn
so back when Season 1 was coming out, how long did it usually take for a HQ video to get posted?
10I'ma going to work on skyladers
walk around for an hour looking and leaving with nothing
Why hello everyone
9oh right

You can exercise your eye muscles, just like Twilight!
HOLY HELL IT'S SAURON. Get in the car.
9Kaidou and Magami are Spike and Big Mac
i just tuned in
9you can now not unsee
Makes you wonder why Discord even corrupted Pinkie. All he had to do was promise eternal chocolate rain.
this conversation makes me glad im naturally as skinny as a rail
do you guys know when this will be on youtube
that's good
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xegHN1AU-WQ
Shooo Taima!

I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS
Mazinkaiser SKL
mISSING wINGS!
I got that too. Genes ftw
BUT THESE ARE AWESOME ROBOTS

DarkRook; it gets worse. She can see everything in the maze from her window, but never does anything.
Missing HornS! >: D
Grandpa eats ice cream before bed at least once a week. Still skinny.
wow.

Yes for Gratuitous English.

No Wai, Seriously?!?!
so it's not like I got there all in a few years
but nobody can Out-Troll discord
9SUP CELESTIA
11DSD, it's better off we use the current characterbox
I also wasn't allowed to play sports as a kid
Fast weight gain/loss is unhealthy anyhow.
due to an eye defect
11The one you created is not that suitable
I already like this ^_^
well I am actually not gaining weight
11I'm being nice
This terrible english is best terrible english
it's been staying the same for quite a while
meh, it needs more wxplosions...
hai all bronies.
Homeostasis: it's what all mammals strive for.

10well the one i made also has everything for skylanders
9don't worry
Just don't go up, I suppose.
one thing I noticed was that this was significantly darker than the other two-parter
Discord isn't hindered by such meaningless things such as ETHICS or ECONOMICS in his Trolling! >: )
11I've "finished" this world
9it's like three minutes of plot in all
I like the new direction
6Hai! :DDD
I wonder if DeLancie had fun recording these lines. I bet he has.
now it's politics porn
/me 14stumbles in and dies on floor
9the rest is ASSKICKING ALL OVER

Oh ghod, lol

I'll take that BIG ASS PIE!
That girl on the left has Fluttershy's hair...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qomos5A1BFE
6Derp.
Laughed at the Fluttershy part
*ahem* gentlemen
Its like a triforce eh?
oh god discord is back....
o, hai Discord!
Why yes I am
Guys, someone needs to do that Applejack lying part with LA Noire music and stuff.
aaaaaaaaaaaaah
Octagon is wisdom and garen is courage and kiba is power.
bronystate wasn't working for me during the episode D:
I will give whoever does that all the internets
It makes sense now.
The Octagon? WHY haven't we seen Rampage Jackson?
10So you guys getting skylanders?
Lagging harder than a Lagomorph with Long Legs
6I'm so happy! Oh so happy!
"Not at all, I AM weak and helpless and I appreciate they understand."
nope, Kiba is courage
Hello shadowLurker
14I might get skylanders
because it's Link's VA
Courage is a good guy one.
i'm having major lag and getting disconnected every now and then
14or wait for the next game, it depends
so Kiba is a good guy?
...no idea
6Idk yet..I'll wait and see what it's like when it comes out and maybe I'll get it when the price goes down..
...Link has a voice
From know, crono_flash will RP as me
I thought his voice was
AAAHH!
HAAAA!
AAAHHHNG!
:3
say, Discord, whow is it to be an incarnation of chaos?
THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME!@ : d
Listen closely this is important a weighty choice is yours to make, a right decision, or a big mistake, if a wrong choice you choose to pursue a rick astley video you will view

10Hey Uxie guess what
...*wonders what it like to voice link*
I mean he didn't even need to talk to them
Zelda said "NOO!" In Japanese in Spirit Tracks
Ok so we're paying you $500
It wouldn't be a fun game if I just told you
9ELEMENTS OF HARMONY, MOBILIZING
i FREAKING LOVE Discord!!
just touch their brains and BAM.
We need you to scream as loud as you can random things
but not words.
shadowLurker its not "chaos" you Scootaloo
10Turns out Aura's been on the spyroforums for some time
What elements? I took care of five.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
14-dances-
I guess he's just a troll like that
6The joy Facebook may bring. ^^
Question?Why not disarm twilight first?
The leader?
Oh god
WHY
I MISSED EPISODE ONE
Scootaloo is a Dodo? Too bad the chicken ship has sailed
we're finishing up char sheets in D&P room
6I wish someone could tell me for sure if a certain pic's been photoshopped.. ._.
This major failure will lead to my suicide
it's watchable on youtube
all my adventurers join the room
please
Oh
14o.o
I AM SO FIxING MY COMP FOR THE SEQUEL!!!!
Also what if pinkie just devolopes a dark sense of humor?
*gone watching*
11I know
I WILL BE READY!!!
Then you have 2 elements to worry about discord.
14look at the lighting of the pic or something
9DYNAMIC ENTRY
Because The element of magic is a mystery, and It's powered by friendship
and there's a recording somewhere (link, NewDCD?)
ohai dcd
11She did some editing three weeks ago
And the dark sense of humor?
This fucking anime.
...
did we account for that?
9Pretender: just click the LQ Stream popup
Nani sounds way cuter than WUT.
9ROCKETTO PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCH
/me hugs NewDCD
Jon: I can see that now. Pinkie: "You wanna know how I got this cutie mark?"
HELLO ALL BRONIES.

newdcd, could you set up a live LQ stream, i'm lagging
10well it looks like shes been here for longer then that
Streams are up on YouTube!

Farewell My Little Bronies! I leave you with one of the most EPIC PMV's EVER!
Pinkie as the joker.yes.
Fibberjack?

Robot groping time.
mech rape
BOOBGRAP?

11I've known she's been here longer than we have since we've joined
DatMan: Yup, sorry
9HANDS OFF FLUTTERSHY, FUCKERS
dumbass
14Aura24?
Oh damn.

He got killed.
THOSE ARE NOT MEN
Damn
wait... they are fighting...
for GIRLS?
Hey
what? discords manipulating them
i guess so
6It looks pretty real..It's nothing really..It's just I've found this classmate that I haven't seen for 8 years and it's kinda hard to believe that put on so much weight..
9BIG MACINTOSH DOES REQUESTS
I don't know... the episode seemed a bit "rushed" to me.
Downloads are up! http://goo.gl/D092H
wow....
lol at light gun controls
Tomokazu Sugita is A BOSS
Sorry girls, we have too many male mechs. You can't battle.
yeah I had that feeling too :/
Where is Mazinger Z?
not even 2 hours and a download is up
9DAT RELOAD
TOTALLY RIPPED FROM EQUILIBRIUM
like they were trying to cram too much into a short time space
what a traumatizing experience to watch someone get stepped on in front of her and have blood splatter
http://www.bakabt.com/160344-mazinkaiser-skl-ova-720p-h264-ac3.html
EPIC RELOADING SKILLZ
11Yes
Discord?Question 41261.Would you accept pinkie as servant?
Thanks spazz !
Yep
._.
bakabt for mazinkaiser
SWEET
Hmm, where is the mecha streaming?
Granted you would have to give her the element back for her to serve you though.
14Oh her
9it's easier to get it from 4chan's /rs/
14she's been here since like forever
/me 6continues to eat her chicken
9Yu: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
NewDCD: where is Mazinger Z?
14chicken~
Hope all the S2 episodes won't be like that
Nope. The element of laughter could seal Discord's doom.
6:3
10Yea
"Whipped it out""Sword fighting"Ummm...Yeah...
14and LOL 8 years is enough time to gain a lot of weight
9Dermathil: this is an alt univaaaars
OH
ah
what is this?
Masinkaizer DSN
Already up on YouTube, though.
DAT 80'S HAIR METAL IN THE BG
9*SKL
never heard of it....
6xD True but it still comes a bit unexpected :P
14xD
any chance of Megas today?
Gotta give credit, the animation is pretty sleek
Well, I think it's due to the 22 minute timeframe for each episode
that be fun
"I'm gonna headbutt you I'm gonna headbutt you!"
MAGNETOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Tentacles?
10so anyone seen icy?
9ORETACHI WA
9JIGOKU DA
They don't play Just cause?
I liked it
no no
they kill stuff just cause
But I don't think it's fair to judge the season just yet. Season 1's pilot didn't reflect the rest of the season.
Anyone here?
6I'm still happy I found that birthday card..A single last name,FB search,accept and then I found half the people I knew in Canada. ^^
9ORETACHI WA JIGOKU DA
LIIIIIINK, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
how many people did this peak at?
pumped
14:O Cool
1200 I think
1200
6I've seen him on Facebook but not here
Poor Kibago
14and nah haven't seen icy
we will NEVER top that record
I enjoyed it, too. Discord is a fun villain.
yeah
I think I saw it almost up to 1300?
So...Spike and big mac just murdered like 54003156 people.
unless somehow next week draws more people
I thought the exposition dump wasn't great, but right after that it got really awesome.
thoughts?
we broke everything with that record
I loved Flutterbitch
NEEDS MORE COMBAT PORN
the chat, the stream...
6Meh..He's probably watching season 2 of the ponies..
grr, stream, why won't you play?
I watched the ep on cable so I wasn't here when it peaked
nice thanks:D and it probably would have been more if anyone could get in lol.. at least me and a couple friends couldn't
Was that 13 minutes?
10meh
People will be Jonesing for episode 2 next week since Luna makes a cameo in it.
i could still see the stream though
Apparently There is one thing that can defeat me. Damn the person the who registered my real name
trolololo
11LOL
your real name is Q
you're not fooling us
/me laughs at Real_Discord
It was like 1200 and then it suddenly dropped back to 700
9SEARCH AND KILL
RANDOM QUESTION TIME: Who's your favorite pony ?
Twilight
Fluttershy?
the max users on the irc network peak at 1437 users today
new favorite pony is discord
Fluttershy
9Twi
Pinkie Pie!
Twi
Rainbow Dash
Rainbow Dash
Wow, managable numbers again
Question?
A.J
Every pony is favorite pony
The episode looked like a fanfiction to me... sort of.
6I found this so damn lolsome. crazy, my good friends brother one time got super hammered and woke up in a bush the next day foaming out the mouth god damn he must have drank alot.. lol he also said some random guy went up to him and put a zebra blanket on him
Can someone find me some fanart?
A beautiful sight
In real life or on MLP:FIM?
That has Dr. Horrible as a pony?
So much bluetext though
I would give them so many cupcakes.
Pinkie Pie. :D
mlp
(:
i pretty much like everypony.. don't got favorites
10XD
Though for real life, the obvious pick is Magneto as best pony.
I'm hoping S2 makes AJ more interesting.
/me SHIT I FELL ASLEEP
/me Dammit.
To be honest not much in season 1 for her stuck out too much to me.
are Derpy named Ditzy doo? i can't remember x3
Derpy doesn't have an offical name yet.
Applejack is best pony. I like how she harvests corn.
Derpy has 3 fanon names
Why was she harvesting corn?
14LOL
Derpy Hooves, Ditzy Doo, and Bright Eyes
Jon: okidokiloki! xD
I thought she did apples?
0That's becouse it's much darker than it used to be
Freeze Frame: Don't forget Bubbles
how long is this series?
bright eyes? i don't know if i've heard that one yet
Derpy is her semi-official name
Agreed
0The show i mean
I like the new darker direction
I swear she was called Bubbles
Yeah
Bright eyes was her sketch name
0I like it too
YES, newDCD, THAT IS THE BEST LINE
I haven't hear Bright eyes either...
espy
(:
you there?
I've seen Bright Eyes in a few fics, too.
I see.
I like Derpy.I know it'll never be offical but.
did she died?
Yeah.
what sketch?
WHAAAT,
I know the CMC Crusader scene could have been cut, but I found it really funny
Derpy did not die,
9Himiko = Trixie
9you can't unsee
or what do yah mean?
but, Derpy is what they call her in the studio
The Lauren Faust Sketches.
For the charities.
Stoneface
uh oh
the link said derpy hooves
ponies wearing off
tired coming back
9ohai Celestia
time to crash
night everypony
or... afternoon
Luna or Celestia?
i was pretty dang positive.. unless i missed something bad
DSNesmith: same here
or late morning I suppose
I go Luna! 8D
0The keep perfect balance between the darker parts and the cuteness of the original
Goodnight DSNesmith!
I think the dark direction is just for the pilot, though. And IIRC, Lauren actually did work on the first two episodes.
6I CAN'T EFFING RIGHT-CLICK. DAMMIT. ._.
2 random dudes in a giant robot show up and murder everyone they see attacking you
i was partying with luna all night
Go get some well deserved sleep, DSNesmith!
violently
or good morning to be correct....
They must be god!
Good Day DSNesmith!
Of this season, I mean. Either way, I can't complain.
Seems legit.
9DEM GUNCOCKS
14o.o
10....
14mouse spaz
Discord seems like a competent baddy, even if he is a huge troll.
yoyoyo
0I seriously hope they keep him for more than two episodes
6Nah..It's slowly dying.. ._.
9Kaidou with a knife = takes out a bunch of guys with assault rifles
9fuck yeah Mech Pilot Spike you're the best ever
wow, she beat 1 guy. What an athlete.
I forget
watching the Equestria online stream that was mad eyesterday....
0or just make him a recurring character
my god it looks good
which pilot is spike and which is Mac?
DCD tell me.
14zS
14xD*
9Kaidou (Sword) for Spike, Magami (Gun) for Big Mac
Well I'll see everyone later. crono_flash/True_Discord signing off.
I saw S2 E1 now.
6Why thank you,fine sir. You are ever so kind.
natle
9>some newb's idea of a joke
/me makes it rain chocolate milk
I just love Discord
0The dark direction may be just for the pilot, but either way it shows that they are not afraid of such a move
he's hilarious
you know how many people we got for the session?
total?
yup
"Tenshinhan posted on September 17, 2011 @ 8:07am Am uploading the whole episode to youtube in higher quality as of this moment	"

Not sure if it applies, this is post-show
0The first episode feels now more mature in a good way. i mean it is still childish and girly and awesome, but the story is "complete". And there is a kickass villain
Spoiler for ep 2 guys: There will be Draconequus.
^Is that what he is?
11Does anyone remember the name of the party crashers in Magma Cone?

I saw someone from Thunder Bay enter on the join feed

I love Discord :D
WHAT DID I MISS
MakerDusk I have a friend living in Toronto, never been to Canada though
9suddenly Yuuki in a badass chickmech
He's a far better villain than NM, he combines psychological tactics with unknown and vast magical abilities.
He's a bit "discordial" for me...heh heh
9>Breast Rapier
9AWESOME.
too far
xD
.what
DEM BOOBS
Wait
Two interesting points: PP's hair didn't deflate when she got angry.
toronto is around 2000km away from here
She just cut with a rapier
Looks like her nipple...got hard.
I call bullshit.
Q is awesome troll.
And TS wasn't targeted.
breast rapier
Yeah
14O.O what?
Shes slashing with a rapier
>"don't know of how much help i can be"
THats not how you use one!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAH
Breakdance Breaker!
>rapes entire army
It is if you're a female mech, apparently
Although I suppose if you consider the other 5 elements as being the means to which Magic comes about, then there's no need.
who's q...?
9it's a Vibrorapier. I think
11We need pictures for SSA characters
11They must be in png
bow chicka bow wow
A character John Lancie played in Star Trek: The NExt Generation
xD
vibro...what..
6I was on hotmail and then accidentally click on the bookmark bar thing and a pic of my old best friend came up. ._.
Oh I was thinking in relation to mlp.
He was just as much a trickster and also possessed godlike abilities.
14:O
14I see
I'm impressed at the 720p youtube
6Gah..I hate png..They keep opening up PS.
11Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure
9THE WORLD
That was hella quick
*shrug* I suppose someponies just think of him as Q instead of Lancie.
11jpg only makes it messy
9last episode is a-go
2 hours basicaly.
11It needs to be png
only 3 eps?
9DAT EYEBALL
9yeah
Ye
9it's an OVA
6Meh..The SSA reminded me of S.A.S. from CoD.. o.o
Oh good god.

Hm, DCD's streaming Gurran Laggan.

Ramirez! take down that AC130 with this Napkin!
Great shot.
I found the start to be a bit... laughable, personally, but it picked itself up halfway through
NIKOPOL AWW YEAH
HNNNGH NIKOPOL
...Its dante...
Did they ever fix episode 4 of GL?
or is GP 01 the one with the nuke?
Teh_Sora: i think the first part was supposed to be funny
RAMIREZ! Do everything!
I like how they're both like what the fuck.
9dat longass sword
celly just came across as useless
dat exaggerated draw
DAT SWORD
thats a long sword
dat giant ass sword
Tovler, they never will. Because it was made by a guest.

SNEAK ATTACK

Meat Cleaver > Sword

oooo espy
celesta + burning gundam
they did not!
+win
WHY must there be this fault?!
ANIKI
grey: + ??? === profit
yes
agreed
Trollestia said that it was only the matter of time
or something like this
He's just an awesome dodger.
so is nothing streaming or is my internet being weird
she got noticed from that distance
it says showtime up top
TWO FACES
luna + shineing gundam
I have problems understanding magic -gibberish
didnt even bother with the slightest bit of camo
6brb
well, yeah, but if those three werent fighing in the meantime, he wouldn't have taken his powers from their chaos
9...I feel like grabbing my Gurren Lagann Revoltech action figure
DO IT
DO IT FILLY
hmmm apple jack + impulse gundam?
it's just my guess, though
CUNNONBALL AHTTAAAAHHCK
wait, that sounds good
I'm so jealous newDCD
Viral's voice is also Link's
you can totally hear it
laser nuke!
9I got it for real cheap
9 10 bucks
new episode was good
no apple jack + shin musha gundam
(Am I just discussing a plot of MLP with fellow adult male?)
new episode was AMAZING
yup
I hate being massively cliff hangered by 2 parters though XD
I have a Revoltech, but I never saw the anime it was from
apple jack + shin musha gundam + win
once i see part 2 ill probably be more excited
if by adult you mean over the age of 21, then nope
===awsome
in retrospect, I should've gotten a GL one
also is the stream working right now?
10ok so i got SSA Abbey has AHT and Cynder has YOTD
9Shutterfly: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
NewDCD: why?
that's the stream
Nah, I mean adult in general. You're not 5 or 6 are you?
9because Owncast is being a bitch
NewDCD: why do they keep switching XD
oh ok
>mfw simon is fucking useless
wait are we watching anime? is a win
Elky, wait for it. Simon is Fucking badass.
hm
we'll see
*goes out and buys another shin musha gundam and repaints in apple jack colors
yes. You'll see.
majority of countries set majority at 18 btw
she has a scarf
yet she's wearing a bikini
im 20
what?
Simon starts out useless but becomes awesome.
i'm 22
and when you do see it, it will be GLORIOUS
hmm its being really laggy
21
NewDCD, quick question? why did you guys start using Owncast?
Think of simon like erika and kaminia like seth from fire emblem
simon becomes kamina in the end
Remember the Fight Kamina vs Ganmen at the beginning?
if adult means that I have to stop watching MLP, then...
Word of God said KAMINA WOULD HAVE WON!!!
Guns vs a giant robot...good plan
Seth keeps his awesomeness all the time but erika becomes awesome aswell.
I'm planing to turn adult at 93
chang: hipster scarf
9True_Discord: Veemi has been taking down our channels
9is it lagging for anyone else?
dcd: too mayn viewers?
NewDCD: why would they do that, copyright concerns?
no
Enki is so pimped out
no lag here
not really
We should set up our own streaming website that doesn't bow down to fucking copyrights
9no idea
NewDCD: i dunno was being stuttery every so often now its fine :P

0 0dermathril spreek je Nederlands?

by putting Discord as the previous ruler :d

0 0i. SPEEK. duits. en. nederlandse.
12Dari, wtf does that mean?
I liked the part where discord had broshades
http://www.bmecha.com/images/post/gundamvsgundam_next_plus.jpg
instant best villian.
^6
^*
It's from Gurren Laggan
Best villain by far
i liked the part where there was ponies
that is distroy mood for unicorn gundam
@DeniedExistenceMobil for sure!
That has the music ^
0 0I SPEEK DUITSE EN NEDERLANDSE
I liked the animated parts.
Oh yeah
the voice went really well with discord
DAI GURREN-DAN
i liked the script
Never too much pony
9GREAT GURREN BRIGADE
Rainbow's part was just not fair! Either way she wouldn't have been Loyal
Q's voice is good for discord.
12Reminds me of soundwave...
GREAT BRONY BRIGADE
thats why celesta + unicron gundam is a bad idea
Oh god, episode 8
did not betray as she was mind-fucked by discord
Know*
6Nah..believe me,I do.. :P
Jon: wait it was Q's voice??
who is Q?
STEAL THAT BIG ASS GUNMEN!
best choice ever
I love the darker feel of the episode
Q from Star Trek
Cosmic level troll
Yep thats Q.
Q is a Star Trek TNG character
Darf14: he was an omnipotent cosmic troll
Q is basicaly a god from star trek
who trolls
i didnt know who Q was....
in star trek TNG
all the damn time.
ThePretender explained it extremely well
He introduced the Borg
being honest
And they should stick with Discord for more than two episodes
Rarely watch Star Trek, so its good to know
Dash was given a tough fallacy, although I know how she could have loopholed it...
@RC agreed
holy crap she was wearing clothes
seriously the only thing this show needs is a good male voiceactor
I think the thing is dash needed to figure out that discord was bluffing.
such a good villain but puts a humour side to being more powerful than celestia
What I love about Discord
clothes? Yoko? Pretime-skip? AHAHAHAHHAHA
RC, waht show?
00does the anyone speek german/?
is that he wants to cause Chaos
because Fuck You, that's why
basically
yep me
Friendship is magic
9PAIN IN THE PATOOTIE
No zephirdd
its a very disturive gundam and the only one i consider truly evil
'It's rare for you to let someone else do maintenance on your gun'
He wants to cause discord.
dat innuendo
dat scarf
He's like the Joker of mlp fim
RC: Q is a good male VA
->Take wings->Go get friends-> Go to cloudsdale
@Zephirdd andjoke around with the Elements
der
and when i listened tyo discord
Discord, the ultimate troll.
which i think was pretty good
Loophole found.
i thought i can die happy now
oh, wait... she's just wearing a scarf
Take wings>Find elements>then go to cloudsdale
Discord is the only troll
00who speaks german?
9OH MAI IT'S A DOOMBITCH KISS
DOOMBITCH KISS

capable of outtrolling Celestia
I DO
wait...
Suddenly romance.
THey lose either way if she takes the wings; its against the rules
>wearing a scarf over a bikini top
Discord= was around in G4 time..... i think.

He's trying so hard.
Man, he has snapped
Jon: that's why the power gauge is unstable.
Black Dynamite didn't do this when his brother passed away.
10also i like the bask story for Sonic boom
It keeps getting even more over-the-top ads the show goes on until the very end
simon is pinkamina+flutterrage
Mega puke.
I hope you liked the description of the word GAR

GIGA PUKE
10*back
HE PUKED HIS HEAD OF
OFF
they finally had somepony to hate on...
and they ceased the day
....Poor simon.
I don't know any furry personally, but I know they are not commonly liked

9with KAMIna representing heaven, and SHImon representing "below"
14I've seen the code for the box on the recently done Zephyr page that uxie did
counter productive
Oohhh, treasure!
9actual canon logic behind their names

Jon: you'll see

14so I can't get it up
btw are we watching the second movie after this?
but m not furry
well this scene IS pretty stupid...
9if there are no plans to do an encore of last night, yeah
10some images are meant for the template
its a diffrent way to show off charters pesonalty
Elky: Nia isn't the brightest light in the canyon.
14I see
10like i think the spyro 2 one has orbs and gems
...Hi symbolism
we could always do that after movie, dcd
The same with comics: do you guys know Blacksad
AssertiveFluttershy: yes
?
Showing that nia is a ray of light in simon's sad life.
I ALSO KNOW THIS FEEL BRO
14can we edit the template to add other ones?
no
Or Maus by Art Spiegelman?
INSERT ODE TO JOY!
10Yea as long as it goes with that game
^agreed!
14ok
10like don't add dark gems to the spyro 2 template

GATTLING PONY
10also i like that fact they are doing sorta DLC for Skylanders
14ok

Your resistance is only...
Hes a robot pony, he cannot win
...Wrong spirit simon.
IMO Chocolate rain was an awesome ref
Nia is made of Cute
9I HAVE A DRILL
Is ..simon going on a suicide mission?
9YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID
Yep he is.
13Wait, isn't the fact you have to buy new toys for new characters a dlc in it's self?
6Damn...I'm getting sleepy.. ._.
AND I'M GOING TO USE IT
you have a drill used to dig
6Dlc?
...
The drill > A megaton bomb!
my argument is somewhat valid
dat Fluttershy
Nia says run with me. Simon agrees
dat badass move
Im a banana
Kitten stinger?
That is one sharp hair cut
Whats with her eyes
Kittan

there also was a news repot or two around that time i belive
nia is derpy hooves
Derpy.
>NewDCD's face when canon Luna will disappoint everypony
i agree
9I like Flutter's conclusion
Nia is obviously a direct reference to nyan cat.
9RobotPinkie how does that work?
^pfffffff
9I mean Nia is older
and then fox treid to under stand them
and by fox imean fox news
OH FOX
Older than nyan cat? Nyan cat goes on forever, I'm pretty sure.
i cant stop staring at nia's eyes
9SUDDENLY LEERON PLOT
you never fail to amaze me
I mean I've never stuck around until the end of the video
DAT FACE!
jus tlike they tried to understand broneys
Rainbow Dash > Nyan cat
I know about that one
Invisible Big Mac.
We need to fix the pilot
RD+NC=Double RAINBOW
not the machine.
dat boota
I forgot about Boota.
9;____________;
Mainstream media in my country rarely talk about internet.
Rainbow Dash + Nyan Cat = Double Rainbow Race
...Suddenly depression.
Q.Q
<3
rainbow dash would win the race
hiiii
Wikileaks were kinda big deal
13Those toys suck
True That!

Thank you <2
lol
Suddenly Water
DAT BGM
<3, even
yes it is
I have to watch the series know
fox news = IRLTROLL
they always make noise when something is considered innapropriate
I've always said that Pony has BGM on par with Gurren Lagann's
:)
I've seen enough jidaigeki to know where this is going...
6I just got the urge to do a video call. o.o
Yay nia's pulling rank!

That's true IMO, Flutteryay.
yay
DAT VAGINA MOUTH
Haha.
or dantas infreno
VAGINA DENTATA
i just spilt diet coke all over my bed :l
Because of inter-species sex?
TTGL is GAR based while MLP is more passive, but they're about the same quality
now i need to change the sheet
DashWithRainbows: D:
yeah
which EA did them selves
What was it with dante'sinferno?

aha
Which is better DCD?
i was very confused for a second
I dont remember any of this
and where things get awesomo
oh
the series is obviously betetr since it has more time, more details jon
saying hell is not a gam
MOVIE AWESOMENESS
True.
10http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110528063436/spyro/images/d/d2/321px-Flaming_Knight.png got this pic off a vid
they just blended 4-6 eps in a scene
the movie is kinda rushed
But is the movie passable?
9oh look it's McBeamspam
10Ended up in Aura's hands
the movie is still great yes
XD
FANSERVICE OUTPUT AT CRITICAL
eand the pissed off the intenathonal nanny asstion

Oh so this is the movie?

I ONLY KNOW HER ONE DAY
also i have desided pinki pie and infinty justace gundam
is it?
BUT I WILL RISK MY LIFE FOR HER
yes
...
Ehh..
John de lancie is a god
he sees nia as the pushing force
like kamina
Maybe not ningyou, but she could be a ningyo since I haven't seen her feet.
so thats why he's doing this.
demon = US deamon =EU
don't you ruin my largely baseless Mary Sue accusations!
Simon Rebirth Best scene in both show and movie
Damn. I learned British English at school. Too much time spent in the internet - you forget the differences
^
HERE WE GO
It BLENDS
Is it me or did the animation just get a lot better
*splat*
Fuck don't fall.

He fell.
The language I mean
9this is all new footage

Long hair.it looks nice but its not good in battle.
Err. Cleavage*.

AssertiveFluttershy, try using a irc client,
I did post it 15 minutes ago
FRIENDSHIP DRIVES US, AND WITH IT, WE OVERCOME ALL OBSTACLES IN OUT PATH
mibbit kinda lags a little
also this scene basically summed up 3 episodes
but could you do it where rainbow dash it the pilot of a gundam?
If you use firefox the Chatzilla addon will do fine
GIGA
If we're the Dai gurren brigade?
DURIILLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUU

9she knew we'd have this conversation
Draw the bronies like the brigade
oh wut
DCD HO SHIT
and now we have faith in him judging from the quality of S2 opening
i thought the movie ended right before timeskip
AWESOME SONG INCOMING
Ok...someone who can draw
please draw that.
So that was Gurren Laggan then?
that was gurren lagann part 1
Movie one dari
Dari: Only the first half
now part 2!
we're watching part 2 now i think.
And Spike is our Spike?
9hold on
9dari
9is there anyone around to do the encore?
no dari there's another movie
that was basically the first 15-ish episodes
So Kamina's hardly in any of it?
6Nah..I'll end up waking up at 3 am and getting in trouble for screwing up my sleep pattern so bad..Not that I would mind waking up at that time.. ._.
9if not, I'm proceeding with Part 2
Can we replace the MLP movie with Lagann-hen?
dcd we could do that after the 2nd movie
9also dari: first eight eps had Kamina in it
kamina is there in spirit
Nope
Bjornfot's trolling must stay.
9I'm not available at the time
NewDCD, maybe. i was just going to ask if the stream is up on MU yet?
and he's never forgotten, even after he's dead
let's see lagann-hen first, then BMN
10oucbh
9but it seems there's nobody to stream the encore
9so I could stream lagann hen in the meantime
/me Hopes that Euroshow doesn't happen
9well
Episode 15 next then Lagann-Hen that shows the fight of Teppelin
True_Discord: same here
Can we watch the next movie of this?
9if there's nobody here by 2PM EST to do so
i watch US show anyways....
9I'll proceed with Lagann-Hen
yayyy
are they doing the mare-a-thon of season 1 here at 2?
I'd assume am and pm stand for antesomething, and post something.
proceed right way dcd
\m/ guitar solo
0;_;
or did i miss that
post meridiem?
we can postpone the show a little
0I CANT WAIT ANY LONGER GHNHGMMGMNGGHGGNGNHMHNGHGNnn RHRHAHRAHRAHRAHHAWWHAWTH
ante meridiem and post meridiem I'd guess.
6Come to think of it I wouldn't even be able to get the computer at 3 am so everything would be pointless. o.o
Aw damn, I wanted to see Blade Runner again, I missed a lot of it.
it was boring, robotpinkie
9well there just isn't anybody here who could stream it
9I don't have it
6:O Thx!

Lagann-Hen begins with simon vs lordgenome showdown
dari: nothing wrong except the time limit
Lagann-hen!

GGgala: Time limit is easy to get around
well, what's your problem?

Even Discord would be shocked at the change in personality.
Tolver: I have a feeling this is what Dischord does on his days off
10is icy ok?
So question
BOOOOOOOOOOOO
What crime did he do?
My girlfriend just happened to go insane and start a doomsday clock.
14xD
Not his.
exterminating life so that the world is more silent?
Fault.
6I guess...not.. o.o
"We don't get it!" Fans of any Gainax anime ever at the ending.
9they're blaming him for the whole "climbing unto the surface" thing
6PINKIE PIE IS CROSSING THE STREET!

Haha, pentagon.
6Don't think so...
10ok

All of guys are bitches.of the guys here are bitches in this jail.
9>Ball Crushing Flying Attack
inb4 rape

14xD
what about Season 2?
also
DISREGARD, I'M REALLY A DEMON
VIRAL
Viral is a...good guy?
14The whole point that I got into spyro was that he was a dragon that could actually fly T^T
sorta.
does any of the rooms work?
13Makes... sense...
9StyxD: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
6And you got that 10 years later. ._. And you'll probably lose it again in this game.. D:
10Bash is an earth dragon Drobot is a robot dragon Zap is a water dragon Cynder and Spyro are dragons Sunburn is a fire dragon/bird and whirlwind is a wind dragon
thanks
EPIC YAWN
Viral right now isn't really a good guy, but he's not a bad guy
14Drobot?
10well in the gameplay spyro can sorta fly
14Seriously
10A robot dragon
14That's lazier than Red.
14They stuck D infront of it
We saved his body
We can rebuild him
We have the technology
Season 2: Scanty, Kneesocks, and Brief I don't see it happening.
Steam Group? Fuck yea.
10yea
but we dont want to spend a lot of money
Season 2 will never happen. It's been confirmed.
10oh and Camo
10the plant dragon
So basicaly
Just like megaman legends 3.
6Would it be stupid to write a message to this dude telling him that we were together in second grade,five days after I added him? ._.
:l
The earthbadguys
I thought it was confirmed that Season 2 WILL happen?
had war with the spaceguys
what a shame. Throwing away a franchise like that.
14not really
and the humans who took over the earth badguy's stuff
No. There shall never be one.
This is a bit different than the english explanations.
are getting the blame for badguys stuff.
but wasn't it supposed to be Blade Runner? Or did I miscalculate time zones?
10nope
What the fuck is this political bullshit?
6Ok,thx!
Hi all
10Wow theres a dragon in every element
10i got better name for drobot
its politics, i aint gotta explain shit!
9StyxD: we currently don't have the encore streamers available
Hi all
9so this is basically making time (also considering we have no pony episodes today)
I still say we just need to call link
14I would except even Microchip but drobot....
10Super Mecha Dragon
3 weeks is enough time
14LOL
@StyxD that and this movie is way better
14Owait
BOOOOO! ROSSIEU
6Rofl It feels so damn awkward to say this..
This is retarde- (looks at Tea Party) ...oh
NewDCD: We could just stream the new episode until someone shows up. There's an HD stream on YouTube.
14let's call him SuperRobotMonkeyTeamHyperForceGo
How long until stream?
I'm mostly here for the lulz. I can't stay for the main event.
10Yes
6Oh hai,we were in second grade together.
9people wanted to watch this movie by popular demand xD
14it won't be that awkward
This is the movie?
Where's the stream at, if not here?
HEY HEY HEY
9http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
movies were terrible last night, this is way better
NO ANTI SPIRIAL
14he might be like "Oh, I barely remember, how are you etc."
WE HAD A DEAL BITCHES.
10could be worse
i am 12 wat is this
Blade Runner's good.
That reminds me, I need to watch Summer Wars
6The fail would be if you had mistaken the person and sent that to some random person xD
:P
G1 is G1, I ain't gotta explain shit.
10yea
6Lol probably :P
14LOL
Warning: If I get the A movie, I'll pick Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona
It's a Spiral Power Shield! Of course!
14They'd be like "....what the fizzle?"
6xDDD
Simon and viral left to die.
Wow.
if i get the choice of a movie, its going to be Death Note
6I recognised this dude the second I saw him but now I feel unsure. xD Still..it's definitely him ^^
Live-action Death Note? nty
6Aaa..some loling does good.
14You don't know if you don't try
Hi bitch.

Question?

6Well,now it's up to him :P
Saving Private Ryan. Yes.
9http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/ stream here
I'm thinking of suggesting Steamboy if I'm picked...
Why did we save nia?
We could let her die.
Blade Runner = good. G1 movie = I'm scared
Steamboy = Most Expensive Japanese Anime Movie
G1 melts your brain
Oh, Seamboy! That's a good one
Im so picking Serenity for A
at least it's not G3.5
He can take deadly lazers like a boss
6I hate how I can't find two certain classmates.. ._.

Since we're all up in the 80s animation, I say The Transformers: The Movie (1985) for B movie
Anti-materiel rifle, more like.
6And it's impossible to search them up in general on fb..I don't remember the last name of the one and the other has an over-common name. ._.
Can Saving Private Ryan be requested if it already played during a special event?
Land Before Time is my A choice
10ouch
Dont shoot the messenger
I doubt it tovler
14xD
6Meh..I'll find'em at some point :P
/me 10takes out Icy's soul

14and you get like 5184518635061406869 people

/nick
Silence, that's a rarity
14you do /trollumad
maybe this isn't goddamn insane
and somehow the milky way is completely fine
xDD
That's a lot of spirals
MrChang: THIS WAS IN A POCKET DIMENSION
We had so many friends in space
god-slaying videogames are the best kind
Not in the real universe
Thats a lot of Friends
12.....
they killed a god
4http://roosterteeth.com/archive/?id=3259
Suddenly old man
Space friends are the best friends
4what the next gen console is
MlpFiM referance
Or the fight would've caused the black hole the enemy feared would happen, Chang.
well this guy is a drunk
6lol.
question
6:D
yesÉ
how come that blue haired guy never hooked up with the yoko girl
?
o.o
answer
He died
so.... what is this called?
MrChang: Kamina^
He's getting married
?
He kissed her and then died
MrChang = If you're gonna pick apart the logic, blow your brains out now because you'll drive yourself insane trying.
This is called an epic movie
yoko has a kiss of death.
9Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
oh great
NOT THAT BITCH
Epic Movie was a terrible movie.
everyone she falls for ends up dieing
she's wearing clothes, finally
REBECCA BLACK
MY EYES

14COME HOME GERPLE
we've evolved past clothes
Joko wearing clothes? She is clearly a spy
Beautiful clouds
xDDD @ video
I mean yoko *facehoof*
Transformers, Robots in disguise
MARRIAGE TIME
she's wearing a tux?
wha?
Rainbow dash: Are you a SPY?
All the stuff I've seen, I call bullshit on her wearing normal clothes.
I DOES
MrChang: she's tomboyish?
Thank god this movie played before the lottery.
i bet they're all 18
I'MA SCAT MAN
/me 4gets out his gun

Forever alone
simon is tight.
Worst
Wedding
?
Ever
how does THIS make sense
*shrugs*
never got a piece of that ass
*shrugs* I just go with the flow
elky, she was an anti spiral
Elky: Killing the Antispirals made her get deleted
gimmy?
I guess clothes that obscured more than half of her body killed her?
She held together through sheer willpower
bullshit, simon IS god
12Wait...
12Who's who?seriously?
There's a fanfic somewhere where Simon screws destiny one last time so that HE disappears instead of Nia.
4lets play
He killed God and took his stuff
6lol?
He becomes a hobo
they went from kamina the weird crazy guy to simon
yeah, I'm going with my explanation
simon goes off to become a space hobo
Like a bawss
4um well i'm DSD
changing main characters just like that
I hadn't even seen you became Friday when I became a gun xD
Btw,I got 13 Screenies
^^
LAG
MrChang, It was always Simon that was main character
epic cape change
9>changing main characters
9lolwut
Kamina was overshadowing simon
BOOTA! FTW
C7 heah
...
/me 4is a a mlg g\pro
9Kamina was always a supporting character
so they had to eliminate kamina
basically a much more asskicking drill-themed doctor
{{
And end.
9he's what you call a Decoy Protagonist
YAY
These credits are awesome
kill him off for the prettier boy
14I WALK A LONELY ROAD THE ONLY ONE THAT I HAVE EVER KNOWN
he's what you call a dmpc
/me 4picks up AK-47_with_Silencer
I can't understand a word they say
HEY
MrChang, well he had to die because his death is what made Simon develop into that character
well he died in a extremely epic, awesome way
TvTropes ftw
You know, I wish the films would actually get dubbed. Probably never happen, though.
I don't think they are going to show the epilogue
I guess I don't have to sit through them
and yeah, character development
i don't get giant robot fighting anime anymore
I can only hope for some kind of PSwG movie.
what happened to good ol Gundamn?
Gundam
without his death they would've failed their first uprising.
Gundam is Real Robot
No scope,quick scope,not a clue..DYIN'S ALL I EVER DOOOOOOOOOOOOO,YEAH YEAAAAAAAAH
MrChang, NewDCD streams Gundam every week.
Star Driver was fairly logical
This is Super robot
/me is picked up.
kayne
9MrChang, there are many genres of mech series
9so yeah
It's true, they built one in Japan, but its only a statue
I still haven't finished PSwG
Well, PurpleProse, the mechs they built in the beginning of the movie were Real robots
get in the chatroom so i dont have to call you later when you might be afk
Both mecha genres are present in TTGL
This movie is more like spirit robots.
/me enables recoil
BAHAHA
a bunch of young adults killed a god?
14Okay people I'm going
14before my mom eats me
hrm
Nuuuuuuuuuu D:

14see y'all late
4*hugs

You hugged her with an AK-47?
4wlecome
MrChang, The drills make sense
4hey

MetalRainbowDash: PM one of them in private and try and set up something
NOT THESE PONIES, Evildoer!!
LORDCELESTIA STOP SPAM
So appropriate touching is fine?
I'm actually glad I've only seen Batman Begins once
wrek: I thought only I was allowed to do this!
05as always robot <3
Once is enough
so SPAM is posting it twice?
<3
what world are you from
LordCelestia, you only need to post it once
No need to post it more
Oh god
oh well whatever
Curious to see Babes in Toyland. I've seen Batman Begins to death.

That's an interesting combination.

Hello Bronies!
Night, Evil Doer!
Later
what's up with the stream? have i missed it? is it broken?
because she's just incorruptible pure pureness
Something like that.
BRB, guys
I wonder what he'll do, or try to do, to twilight?
Hello Bronies!
or is the mind-raping over?
/me goes to do errand for parents
Is it still at the dinkleburg?
Hi Rye!
DashOrCrash - he's already done it. How do you think she'll fare without her friends?
my guess? not even close
Touché
Hello fellow Brony
/me comes back
*fluttershy whisper* what's up with the stream *hides*
Ummm, the stream does not seem to be working? It just keeps showing a circle!
It will end up like season 1's pilot:
My stream just closed
I don't think we're watching anything right now.
she'll go after the villain on her own
Thats going around and around and around & gets dizzy
Wonder what how discord will change Twilight. Is the opposite of magic science?
How do I get it back
and fail epically
Mine's been down
even the backup stream is apparently down
rye, disaidra: http://www.dinkypage.com/cronoflash
it's offline right now
FiM has crashed three streamers
but if something's streamed, it'll be there
>mi cara cuando
Ok I will try the link... Thank you Elky
seems down too
Yea
Damn, I didn't know friendship was that powerful
thankyou
LunaTheForgotten - It's the most powerful force in the universe. With the possible exceptions of love and hot-bloodedness.
Just remembered, Portal 1 is available for free download on steam, so if you haven't bought it yet go grab it for free
Congrats bronies, we've broken the internet
so... is something else going to be streamed today? I'm here for the first time so I don't know what to expect
Discord,I thought you left
Staying up 26 hours for a show that got uploaded on youtube in 20 minutes
My guess is, either Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash will snap out first
I just got done watching the episode on the DVR... Not going to say anything though, since I do not want to spoil anything to anyone...unless everyone here seen it already?
I have,
I have
9Oh God...
9OH GOD
ep1 think yeah
Actually, now that I think about it, didn't they all seem back to normal at the end of part 1?
Styxd: Thre seems to have been some problems
9I just realized something guys
WHAT'S WRONG DCD
?
?
What!
Storm Chasers starts next Sunday.
?
?
?
Yes? NewDCD?
I though I come back with some news on getting Portal 1 for free
??
?
??
?
???
???
!
9>mfw I'm now expecting Simon to fully hijack Geass R2's ending in Saisei-Hen
i'm sad, i got the orange box a while ago, have hardly played any of it except portal, and now they're slowly making them free :P
????
¿
?!?
?@?
Nittany_Tiger: Really?! Sounds awesome!
#
¿?
9"IT'S TIME FOR ZERO REQUI-WAIT IS THAT GURREN LAGA-"
NOOOOO
9"LELOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"
WEll portal is only free for download til the 20th
I caught a tornado myself this year (possibly more).
NewDCD: So we watching Blade Runner or is that out of the question?
Well it can make Code Geass any worse than it already is
9"LET ME SEE YOU.....GRIIIIT THOSE TEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETH!!"
NOOOOOOOOO
he will be to busy fighting Anti-Spiral at the same time
XD
lol
We're watching Episode 2 of Season 2
9I can't stream it. I was hoping someone who could would be online by now...
EVEN SIMON CAN'T BE AT TWO PLACES AT ONCE!
hows it going guys? :)
But he trys to save god in that one.
Yes he can.
Sol, I wish
I, uh, don't think I'm familiar with most of the stuff you're all referencing right now... o.o
9Flaschen that will probably happen
Simon can do anything
Now I'm out
Lauren decided to release it early for a day just for us
You guys like episode 1?
9before they go fight the Anti-Spiral
So whats everyones favorite pony, I seem to like rainbowdash but I think apple jack comes in as a strong second... but then again Fluttershy has that cute voice. :)
Luna
Okay, NewDCD
Rye: Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Fluttershy
Rye: Toss up between Rarity and Twilight.
twilight RD and fluttershy
I prefer Trixie, personally
Luna followed by mane6, then Derpy Then teh rest
RD.
i hate trixie to be honest
Luna,Octavia,Scratch. My top three
Trixie needs backstory
I think she would be fun to mess with
pinkie pie or fluttershy
then she COULD become likeable
i want episode 2 now i finished watchign epuside 1 #:P
Trixie would say, "anything you can do, I can do better!"
They ALL need backstory, really.
I saw a backstory of Trixie in EQD
and I'd be like "ORLY"
As I said, my guess is, either Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash will snap out first and you?
hmm
Rye: YES!!!!!!!
and then I'd die
how can she die better than me?
I think RD Will go to cloudsdale, notice something, element inside all the ponies will go BLAH and chaos guy dies
SHE! JUST! CAN!
but the first one to snap out? Rainbow dash
so the copy of portal will stop working after the 20th?
No one dies in MLP FIM
Discord for Big Bad!
Elky: No, that's not how it works.
FOR WHOLE SEASON
you download it now, you keep it forever?
nice
http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/pokmon-get-in-mah-belleh.jpg I WANT THIS!
shes the one with something she can notice, shes goign to cloudsdale. once she notices nothing is wrong, she'll snap out
the others are just reversed
I got Portal in one of these free promotions, and it's still fine.
any streams on?
link to the stream again please
"for science?"
Oh boy! New comic!
sweet
DAT IS RELAXO-ING
it closed accidentally
Revolver,So do I
I smell a portal reference!
What's this about Portal?
you need only to start downloading portal till 20, or complete the download?
Apparently, it's free right now.
Haha, not a bad comic.
Apartment cleaning time.
No streams yet
I just hope I'm not downloading it only to have it vanish after the 20th
that's the last muffin she will ever take
Also, have to grade papers.
Elky: there was once such an special. my version still works
for 5 months now
Good Comics
*sigh* this music is so relaxing...

How long until a Chocolate Rain PMV? Now? Yesterday?
I'll read it LordCelestia
I'll check it out
Theres only a prologue and part 1 right now, then an ideas list.
I'm not doing the video because EVERYONE is expecting it
6It's a script, or at least should be.
Even the CREATORS are expecting it
just found this nittany_tiger http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOorrsfUWK8
Tiffany Nigger? you racist.
In fact, you could say the entered a time warp and are basing the chocolate rain part of the episode based off of a PMV spoofing those moments from the episode.
*re-reads*
ooooh
Good song
So yesterday.
there's another one, but this was the first one on the list
ill brb guys
/me will be right back

MetalRainbowDash: When you were trying to get the mods attention. You said you needed to speak to them about something?
Batman Begins and Babes in Toyland.
who cares abvout next weeks movies, lets worry about it in a few days
I see.
I was talking with the OPs and they rejected my application, and I kinda got upset, and..
Ok just...
It's a long story.
I know the feeling.
But I really couldn't mod anyway. Too busy with school.
A Mod application?
yes.
/me is clapping MetalRainbowDash on the shoulder
Oh okay, did they email you saying you were rejected?
Flutter Shytrenko was a hero. She deserved a heroes death. but she died for nothing... like an animal. As I watched my closest friend die, It became clear we were not the only ones looking for Nova 6.
Western allies circled like Griffons..."
-Rainbow Dashnov, Blank Ops
Nevermind.
Rainbow Dash or Nightmare Moon for Resnov
Reznov
Rainbow Dash

No. Bobby Kotickvich.
/me MY NAME IS RAINBOW DASH! AND I WILL HAVE! MY! REVENGE!!!
Exactly **

Twilight as mason
I thought about that actually
Hudson?
I thought Pin kie Pie would be better suited
/me has a boredom :(
Twilight could be Hudson (i actually am writing this on DA)
Weaver could be rarity who knows
I thought AJ for Weaver personally
Confirmed Characters:
Rainbow Dash = Reznov
Fluttershy = Petrenko
Dragovich = Discord
I have named the turtle George Gustavson.
Mason = Pinkie Pie
Hudson = Twilight
crap whats that other guys name i forgot
damnit holdon
Trixie for Steiner
WOODS
I never really played CoD
Woods = Applejack

Hey celi what's with Kravchenko?
I can't give a laptop CPR!
My laptop now smells like turtles.
one, I don't have a license, two, it would just ruin the laptop
Seeing as movies is a bust today, I bid you good day bronies. And what a good day it has been.
Cranberry_Scotch: Do you have a spare defibrillator laying around?
...after giving it CPR.
No
I thought you had to be a nurse or nurse's assistant to have one at the house?
use a Medikit
Kravchenko and Steiner... lemme think.
Trixie for Steiner
she doesnt seem like a scientist
Stop giving me suggestions on how to revive human patients for my laptop!
Nightmare for Kravchenko?

This is more grimdark than G4 actually :|

Damn this is grimdark
Can I post the link?

Dat face
Nah, for G1 it was pretty good
Why am I watching this again? T.T
SuperBrony64 go to my name on the top tabs
because of me, apokalipse
because you're a glutton for punishment
We're watching this in parts. Damn it!!
Blame Bjornfoot
I sort of like this, no joke
I'd blame bjornfot, but you can't hold a grudge against best fort
Showoff
he's our resident viking
aww yeah
Good job guys
HOT DOG
Ohai G1 Rarity
EVERYONE HATES YOU, LICKETY SPLIT

*nothing*
What a bitch
GOD

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm not calling it a song
Ok why are we watching this on youtube?

G1 is actually not too awful
what were lottery results?
G3 is worse
Everyone tell her no
Because GGgala is 'saving' us
g3.5 is almost worse
but newborn cuties... AUGH¨
G4 is the BEST
SONGNUMBER
Indeed
G2 is never mentioned......
gotta love songs from FUCKIN' NOWHERE
G2 never got a show
These voice actors sound like 4 year olds
Ahhhh
G2 is more of a continuation
what were the lottery results?
Dat bag
She has a Mary Poppins bag
DAT MOUTH

No problem :)
Anyways
Im gonna leave cause
G1.
I've suffered it already
SHOOBEEDOOOO
Is it bad that I like the witches more than the ponies?
movies not that bad
This is terrible,Curse you Bjornfot
no, the witches are generally more entertaining
Smooze is best pony, though.
and the villains have somehow more character depth
I take that back Bjornfot
Nah, this is more girly than anything else
and one of them is just slime
More diabeetusy
WEEEEEE can't go hommmmmmmeeeee
gummy, I think so
this doesn't give me diabetus it gives me a migrane
From diabeetus
No you can
you're just an EARTHLING
Can't
she was against him coming along before and now she's okay with it?
no
My ears bleed so much right now
falling... WITH STYLE
Stupid earth pony.
THEY DIED THE END
G4 gives me a migrane. Because FWUTTUWSHY is soooooooooooo adorable
But in a good way...
Who voices Spike? Charlie Adler?
I mean diabetus
this just gives mea migrane
I never wanna hear Spike complain about Twilight's antics again. This is what he could have ended up with
Let's have a party now that she is gone
YA THINK!?
Spike is in this movie you know...
ONE SOUNDED LIKE BART
You know what I hear?
wasn't there a twilight in G1
?
"WAAAH! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
Somebody call the WHAAAAAAAAMbulance!
MY ears!!! I'll be deaf for a week
That's all I hear
WTF just happened
movie melted the connection
it was to shmoozie
YAY!! No more Spike making my ears bleed
and now shmoozie is a word
Shmoozie?
can all my adventurers join the D&P room?
Angry Hydia is angry
EWWWWWWWWWWWW
session starts in about 1 hr
shmoozie: adjective: so overly sweet it kills all fun in whatever it's in contact
with
That was a lot of blood for a tiny bug
GORE
the smooooooze
IN A KIDS MOVIE
This is pretty grimdarks
THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
I love Hydia
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY SMOOZE INTO GRUNDLELAND
Example: "My Little Pony is so shmoozie it melts my brain"
Hydia is best pony

Damn right your heavy
HOW CAN THE HORN ITCH?!
SPIKE LIKES DAT PLOT
Oh wow, are we watching MLP The movie?
yup
yep
The witches are better at Friendship than all the other ponies in ponyland.
eeyup
Hey TrollightSparkle
and the villains have somehow more character depth
COMBINED
and one of them is just slime
G1 Rarity sounds like Bart
/me goes to fix some chicken tenders
how are you more 1-dimensional than living slime
Of course the villains are better at friendship.
/me has at least some chicken
they're witches, right?
Somewhere out there, there's and alternate reality in which Friendship is Magic didn't happen. The one sliver of positivity that I can find in that reality is that we wouldn't find ourselves watching this.
and friendship is magic...
SuperBrony64 Hiya
I read Cupcakes while this was playing last night. Cupcakes was....interesting...
Where have you been SuperBrony64
She casts the one ring.
LunaTheForgotten: Helping MetalRainbowDash with his channel
THROW HER IN
Saying the villians have more depth than the ponies is like saying that a pond is wetter than a desert.
Nittany, Why did you read that?
Curiosity.
Nittany_Tiger if you want something even more "interesting," look up Ask Pinkamena Diane Pie on tumblr.
TREMBLE BEFORE ME
Where are we watching this movie? I can't get the stream to work :/
Good for you SuperBrony64
Here comes the family friendly Cthulu abomination
smooze needs own show
YOU CAN'T STOP
THE SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZE
I've check up on Ask Pinkamena Diane Pie.
FUCK LICKITY SPLIT
Nittany_Tiger: Ask Pinkamena Diane Pie is pretty much the best of the "Ask X" tumblrs. It's so incredibly awesome
SuperBrony64
wait wait..
LunaTheForgotten: Thanks!
Anytime
I think we missed something here.
My forum avatar is a picture from Ask Pinkamena Diane Pie.
Smooze you need me!
Smoozed
Oh while I'm here, I'm running the developer preview of Windows 8, does anypony have any applications they want me to check? I've got a folder of screens too if anyone wants them
...no, wait it's just bad editing
I wanna see a JJ Abrams My Little Pony set in this continuity, ending with a cosmic reboot that sets up Friendshi is Magic
Is it open to gaming?
How do you change your name
Nittany_Tiger: If it's more intensive than StarCraft: Brood War, then no.
Dat bad voice acting
LunaTheForgotten: /nick
I'm worried that Windows 8 will turn your PC into an Xbox 360.
This movie…isn't really a movie. It's more like an extended episode.
Pikamena,Thanks
Nittany_Tiger: As far as I can tell, it's just as fast as Windows 7 if not faster
*Pinkamena*
Oh.
That's what all hasbro based movies of the 80s were
Is the Smooze something nice?!
Nittany_Tiger: They've made a LOT of optimizations and it's running really well for me. Aero even works without 3D acceleration
Yes it is very nice
why can't we watch the rainbow sprite movie? that had a rocket horse
Okay, I have to give credit
The ponies have a good idea: Get to the castle. Good idea.
DOS EYES
You have to eat smooze to see how nice it is
This is gonna be hilarious
Does it run on older systems.
Windows 7 actually runs worse on my PC than Vista.
Those of you who didn't watch last night missed some of the best chat
Bart pony is best pony
inb4 Smooze song
Mary Sue Megan
More crashes w/ W7.
PONIES!!!
Ohey G1 Applejack
Nittany_Tiger: It's passable on a system with no 2D acceleration at all, which every system has nowadays, even the crappiest
that'S horrible *smile*
My middle name is danger
Smooze song!
Nittany_Tiger: I can't comment on stability since it's pre-beta, but it's impressive for pre-beta. It's usable, and that's more than I can say for most pre-beta software
/me can't be stopped
Mine was built in 2007 at near state-at-the-art at the time.
SONGNUMBER
You don't take the Teenager
SMOOOOOZE
>THat's awful >Is smiling while saying it
YOU CAN'T STOP ME
But they take two little kids
Nothing can STOP the Smoooooze!
Nittany_Tiger: Then it should run fine, though don't be surprised if there are radical changes made to it between now and release
Best song
I have to admit, they're actually TRYING to protect themselves
We will find a way to stop you Smooze
Sandbags and such
O U
Nittany_Tiger: http://s1191.photobucket.com/albums/z467/Windows8Screens/ <- If you haven't seen screenshots yet, there are also pics of brood war running without any graphical glitches
I just don't want closed-platform gaming.
Closed-platform PC gaming is a publisher's wet dream.
I saw G1Pinkie
TASTE THE RAINBOW MUTHAFUCKA!!!
How do you mean, closed-platform? You mean like Windows exclusive?
...oh you heard the xbox rumors
And then the Rainbow was split into the Elements of Harmony.
Take that Smooze
Give him a taste of the Motherfuckin rainbow!
Elements of Harmony: FIRE!
No no no, there's no xbox functionality in Windows 8, the UI is similar, but that's it
Taste The Rainbow MUTHA FUCKA
Smooze you need me inside you...
Making your PC run like a game console where you don't have root control of the PC.
Elements of Harmony would have NUKED the Smooze
I'll be back in a minute
SMOOZE THE RAINBOW MOTHAFUCKA!
I have to go eat dinner
Bye
They imprisoned a GOD with it
Bye Luna
Bye
i instantly hate the human boy even worse than Megan already
So you're forced to use the software and play the game the way the makers want it to be played.
Uh oh
Unless you jailbreak it.
Nittany_Tiger: OH
Yeah. Like "Smartphones."
...DUDE! The Smooze didn't lose! It swallowed a weapon that KILLED A GOD.
Nittany_Tiger: Win8 is NOT closed platform. You can still run and install any valid windows program. All win32 applications install
So, are the light colors indicators of how many people are in that room?
Cool. So I can still code on it.
olol
They forgot me :(
Mother of the Year
Though I mainly prefer Linux for coding.
Nittany_Tiger: One of the developer previews comes with the new software that would be needed to use the new Windows API
don't worry floom, we'll soon be together...
<3
incoming musical number
SONGNUMBER
lol XD
Wow, what flip-flops
Elements of Harmony > Rainbow of Light
Floom/Smooze 4eva
And then Megan became Celestia
There's another problem. Microsoft may close off third-party peripheral support like XNA has with 3rd-party controllers.
Celestia vs first villain (forgot the name) Celestia wins
Tirak
Remember kids, Your childhood is not always better than the present
thx
But since it's going to be open, that shouldn't be a problem.
So, this is the Portal everyone's been raving about...
Tirak vs Discord is no fight, it's a massacre
Unclean pony! Burn her!
The Moochick makes another appearance? Really?
feels awesome.
Discord would have a field day with G1 ponies.
KILL IT WITH FIRE
Nittany_Tiger: I REALLY doubt Microsoft would do such a stupid move. The advantage of Windows over OS X is that it works on almost all hardware. If Windows started limiting what hardware and peripherals could be used with it, everyone would flock to Linux and OS X more than they already are
Yeah.
in this stream: Floom's GPY
And Microsoft needs to make that known to the public.
With Windows 8.
In other words, one look at the Floom = FUck That!
The fact they're having a developer preview at all means they want MORE 3rd party support, not less
Eye scream
Windows 8 looks pretty cool. I might switch from Mac to that if it turns out to be awesome!
:(
These two are basically PCs
floom owns them both
wow the Floom has naughty tentacles
They need to make the next XNA support third-party controllers instead of just XBL ones.
You bet I do
*X Box 360 ones.
yet there's still some in the bottle
SuperBrony64: I advise against buying Macs in general. OS X is fine if you're running a Hackintosh, it's a good unix-based OS, but the restrictions are killer
SuperBrony64: The UI of Win8 takes some getting used to, but it grows on you
Pinkamena: I want to keep myself from paying $1500 for a new computer :P
Build your own.
SuperBrony64: Then don't? Building your own isn't hard
oh look, it's Star Trek chess
Oh hai Angel
Vulcan Game Board
They aren't as pretty then :3
It's Angel's father
hay guys
Please tell me you're not about form over function
He can't tell a person from a pony?

So, what are next weeks movies?

Good steering Spike
After seeing this movie, I think we should all fund the effort to rid Smooze from our planet.
Why is it so laggy

suddenly this guy is alright
Awesome
shoo be doo, shoo shoo be doo
Eat him
PLZ
How does this work=
?
EAT'IM!
That's what she said
Feed me Seymour
this is the worst plan ever
PLZ Eat them so this movie can be over
Smart monster
GOOD PLAN GUYS
i don'T know. i did play WoW once ago
....
Laughter always works.
this plan was STAY TOGETHER
ticklish Spiderses. what'll they think of next.
we split and died
Get a basilisk
The element of laughter saved them
Giggle at the giant spider monster...ies?
The fact that this worked doesn't change the fact that it still the dumbest thing said so far.
SPIDERSES
oh god what, it was maintaining its web out of telekinetic projection?
THE SPIDERSES ARE TICKLISH
They're not ticklish they have an exoskeleton...
....how's it falling apart?
Web spell
what is the point of being a spider-like monster
if you make it with magic
...wow. Nittany_Tiger, you may be interested to know I ran the first portal in the VM with NO acceleration of any kind what so ever and not only did it not crash, it actually ran at 6 or so FPS
It's like one of those hopping spider creatures from Ocarina of Time
Minimum settings of course, but still, not even 2D accel.
I might have to suddenly go
Octoroks?
...Go Wind Whistler.
Why does Wind Whistler sound like a Transfromer that would turn into a falcon
heyall
So if I disapear, know that I will see you guys next week
Dis cut
there should really be flutterponies in G4
they're so delicate and sexy
Hey Derma
On W8?
Rarity was a flutterpony
what's the stream link?
<Flutterponies> FUCK YOU, GO AWAY
So many Fluttershy clones
espyyy
Burn!
OHAI G1FLUTTERSHY
We'll help the big ponies.
no
yes, let the queen welcome them without escort
WHAT'S WITH HER EYES?!?!?!
except if they give us money
No
evil guys would kill her
Nittany_Tiger: Yes, on Win8
It's everyponies fight
So, what's streamed after the BMN?
*ends*
They have filly Flutershy's long legs too.
Hmm.
darn Portal. I missed the movied.
I'd think good hardware would allow you to run Portal on VM efficiently.
aww yeah Smooze it's a scene with us in it
Tovler: portal good?
It's amazing. A might easy so far.
"Close your eyes."
Nittany_Tiger: Well remember, no 2D or 3D acceleration, and the maximum vram is 256 mb
YAY I OWN EVERYTHING
Damn they're fast
Smooze, You about to get owned
I really haven't messed with VM myself.
Smooze, prepare your sphincter
Get the Smooze Flutterponies
Smooze, you're about to get floomed
...why couldn't just teh pegasi use their wings?
AIR BLAST
Spray our musk on the smooze!
Flutterponies used Gust. It's super effective!
BEHOLD MAB, PONY QUEEN OF AIR AND DARKNESS
Flutterponies are air benders O:
Smooze fainted!
Such chat lag for me >_>
They all die, The End
Witches has lost the battle.
Suck it Smooze
:c
RoL is back BITCHES
Flutterponies: The closest thing we'll get to G4 ponies in the pre-G4 days
Pinkamena: I once ran a program through an X-terminal once (Xming). I usually just used X terminals for accessing my school PC.
>sweet stuff
Brutal Honesty
Nittany_Tiger: Oh you don't use the terminal much? I use it all the time
TASTE THE RAINBOW, MOTHER FUCKEr
damn it
I use terminals a lot in Linux and on my laptop with Xterminal.
maamaaaa
Smooooze what happened?
And I'll use WinSCP.
i think... we got...
*sunglasses*
smoozed
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH
Guys, I have to leave in abou ten miutes
Flutterpony musk!
*about*
What would Spike say if he could see himself in this alterante dimension?
Which one?
'what the fuck is this shit'
another donut! Extra sprinkles!
G4 spike would facepalm.
is my guess
YOU CAN HAVE DREAMCASTLE
WE HAVE A NEW PLAYSET NOW
G4!Spike: dafuckisdisshit.jpg
We had no plumbing in Dream Castle anyway.
I can
Entrust the whiney little bitch with the god-slaying weapon
OOOOOH. (my first-ish stumper in Portal)
Nittany_Tiger: WinSCP... isn't that for FTP? Or SSH?
Is there a movie after this
What a Mary Sue
No
I feel like watching the S2 premiere again
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/1c3f44bfec64ef28e083f8505e005ba4/59626%20-%20bronies%20ei%20meta%20show_ruined%20target_audiece%20this_fandom%20watermark.png
I need to dilute the sugar
cool
>mfw that image
Pinkamena: Both, though I use it mainly for FTP. It can do SCP as well and a few other remote things.
Lisa Simpson! wat
I use Xming for SSH.
Yeardley Smith?
or... Bart >_<
Nah, I told you it was Bart pony :P
Can we skip the credits? possibly?
@Floom: yeah, I noticed that too B)
That's so awesome
oh well, i hope y'all enjoyed my movie pick http://i53.tinypic.com/6ds650.jpg
I've seen all I need. Later Bronies. The countdown to episode 2 has begun.
smooze was defeated
Toei Animation,Haven't seen that in a while
Bjorn I still hate you
It was OK, I guess
Bjorn, is that you?
How could you pick this movie?
yes sol
Nittany_Tiger: I thought so, I used it for FTP a bit
Bjorn, I love you
Thank You Bjornfoot. It lived up to my hype
Bjorn, You troll
Bjornfot, it was everything i hoped for
It wasn't bad. It had a few nice scenes, the villians were entertaining, and the Flutterponies made up for the faults of the main cast.
The floom was best
smooze is best pony.
Smooze pony is best pony
smooze is worthless without floom
It is, however, a movie that's better mocked than enjoyed straight.
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

It needs to DC from the network.

This vid is Trippy AND Awesome
this music kicks ass
is mike my brain on a avrage day
My dorm neighbors just put a ton of wasabi in the one guy's sushi.
for the record, this commercial's called Superflat Monogram - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Pg9wmaGlg
wow
wat
My neighbors are RD, apparently.
my brain on an avg day: Segmentation Fault.
a commercial...
muting the stream, and having Wu-Tang play in the bg is quite...interesting
Descrption: "An old louis vuitton commercial made by Takashi Murakami, directed by Mamoru Hosada..
"
Ah, fragrance commercial
I'd be pissed if I was that girl right now
nooo, not programming!
That explains the randomness
muting playing Katamari Damacy music in bg. Same as before
Old as hell, look at that phone
05this reminds me of digimon the movie, yay childhood nostalgia. must be a few of the same animators
I do a butt-load of programming every week.
Wrek: same here man
I thought the same thing, Wrek
Wrek, it does look a lot like
All that for a cell phone
Nittany_Tiger: Programming is magic fun time
also, this movie needs to be played sometime here
Girl: "MOM! I wanna buy a Louis Vuitton now! To hell with college!"
I do it for fun
It's me after I watching a new pony. How depressing
It is fun.
this is only better with lag...
:\
Java is fun, C++ isn't
AWWW YEAH
YES
Oh boy
FUCK YAE!
Sol you are a genious
Time for MC Public Urination and MC Chorus Guy
Java, C* so alike man
I've learned a lot of Matlab in the past two weeks.
/me BRBs because she really needs to and has been delaying her BRB for the longest time so... BRB
05aaaw yeah
c++ is fun the same way that df is "fun"
PHP: Why am I doing this again?
05wtf collective is win
losing is fun!
Matlab...?
I was rasied on .lua
mooponi, 'df'?
I've touch Perl, C, and Matlab so far.
dwarf fortress
ahh
I was raised on 3Ds Max
Learned C in a class. Taught myself Perl and Matlab.
With help.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIFdywkXhwA
you spent ages building what you think is a thriving and unbreakable stronghold
then it all goes to shit
/me prefers Python
I learn lua by ripping apart scripts in homeworld 2
Kids are being raised on a 3DS
Perl is easy, but Matlab code is a bitch.
sounds like C++ to me
when I was like 10
even though they're similar, I click more with Java. C++ makes me flip tables in rage.
05i prever cinema over 3ds max
05prefer*
Applejack's United States of Apples
tbh my C like coding funky
I just like 3ds Max cause it's what they use at my school

05MC chorus guy makes this video worthwhile
