Ghosties why the change

04Because nobody could find Hawk Jones
No Shamroc yer a slag.
alexxm: because ppl are trolls and make mods try and find a movie no one has

sergio_scriptor: I'm so hungry, I could eat a Tom

FairysHuff i usaully watch both
04I was actually struggling between Fear & Loathing and Clerks as B movie
FairysHuff: I'm gonna be here tomorrow.
I know theres at least 1 download of my B movie floating out there.
alexxm: YAY! Company ^_^
Ghosties: I'd have loved to have seen Fear and Loathing
kewl
I used to watch both, when I was still here a few months ago.
Ghosties: FEAR & LOATHING!
because damn is that movie cool.
AgentKalim: YAY! More companys! HUGS ^_^
Ghosties: YOU CHANGE IT NOW!
clerks
04But Fear & Loathing was released nationwide with a really large budget. Clerks did not get that kind of release, the budget was really low and not released in many places
/me feels ignored
Naps for every pony!
Yay~ 39 more minutes :)
04Plus, Clerks is just as good as Fear & Loathing if not better
let's all finish this story together
RAWRity what was your b movie
FairysHuff: Set phasers to HUUUUUUG
alexxm: Nudist Colony of the Dead
while waiting for the movie to start im watching star trek the next generation.
i swear to god Ghosties one of these days i will demand to see " Max the magician" :| you guys own me that JK:$
When I walked out side I saw...
Fear and Loathing is not very well know and Clerks is famous
RAWRity cinema snob fan brohoof (\
sagas: But I've never seen Clerks.
I've been insisting on having a B Movie that's always going to be found on Youtube. Now I'm switching to one that can be found on Steam.
1 vote foe clerks
alexxm: /)
AgentKalim: *Ultimate running jumping spinning cyclone hugs of luuuuuuuuuurv*
Hello all! How are ya doing all?
04I get that, sagas. But as it stands Clerks really is the epitome of an indie film
You know what I've never seen Hunchback.
Ghosties: I guess
So scratch that.
good!
i'm good kempa how about you
Who want's bronwines!
Idea: Twilight Breaking Dawn part 1 as A movie
No
0,14I will end you.
hai kempa
So Fear & Loathing had a big budget. I take it that movie wasn't successful?
the only good Twilight is Twilight Sparkle.
RAWRity: lol
04It got pretty bad reviews by critics, but the audience loved it if I recall
I made them special from the bottom of my neighbor's liver!
I watched The Room, but you're NOT making me watch Twilight
jay and silient bob need i say more
I vote for "Cheech and Chong: Up in smoke" or "Born in East LA" :)
YOU ARE NAAAAAAAAAHT
?
Pewdiepie anyone?
04Fear & Loathing is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen
Hmm, I see.

Darkness_Pony is with the BARRELS!!!
techiically Twilight counts as a A movie O_O

I like chair's
Pewdiepie is totally related to Pinkie Pie
Just sayin.

Oh dear... My body is telling me to go pray to the porcelain god O_o Back in a while... maybe.
Trixie is best pony
How long has Everfree radio been on? O_O

0,14eenope, Custard
Fear and Loathing got mixed scores when it came out IIRC
YES :D
Custard: No. That's just an ad.
FairysHuff: good luck 6_9
owlicious: the odds of it being WMC is going to be low since we'd all make fun of every thing that happens in that movie

Five years later, a group of campers on a retreat argue with each other about religion and sing big production numbers as the group begins experiencing an attrition problem

Somebody gets a Vampire reference

Bold Bigflank.
Ghosties: Next B-movie change should be Beer Fest IMO

You know, because you can't say "GOD" in a disney movie.
Hey Everyone!

Where the hell is Shirley!?
Meanwhile: True. The closest I've seen to the original was probably the silent version with Lon Chaney. At least Quasimodo dies in that version, though not in the same way as the book
That gargoyle is either old, female, or both.
festivus for the restivus
Dah pope
its sad cause in the old black and white movie, at the end Quasimodo laments asking the lifeless Gargoyles "Why couldnt I be made of stone like you guys?"
;Teh Pope.

No, the Pope

This movie didn't do well when it came out.
otakon...So it's Thriller?
Spazturtle: The hunchback is also a crazy rape-monster (not a joke) in the book, too. And Frollo's not psychotically evil.
He is killed and she is framed for his murder and hung

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Directors Wise, Trousdale, and Hahn have noted that the three gargoyles might exist only in Quasimodo's imagination and thus may well be split-off pieces of his own identity. However, most of their characteristics, including Hugo's infatuation with the goat Djali, seem unique to their manifestations when present (and there is of course the question of how the

The gala :)
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Nostalgia Critic put Hellfire as #1 of his best Villains Songs list. He claims that it's because, rather than singing about how evil he is, he sings about his own failures and obsession and how he's to cure himself of it.
otakon: you just spoiled it again
Yes.
ITIS
Was this before or after the PG-13 rating was invented?
/me slaps everypony

Randomnerd: this was when disney was good
I DONT WANNA
That chorus. In the first episode of Friendship is Witchcraft, Pinkie Pie is singing those words.
Silverscreen: IKR
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the scene where Judge Frollo sings "Hellfire" and sees Esmeralda dancing in the fire before him, the MPAA insisted that the Disney animators make Esmeralda's clothing more well-defined, as she seemed nude.
hell
Frollo is a dirty old man
Creeper

molestia needs to attack frolo like badly
If they're not capable of love, why did YOU fall in love with her?
No, it's a trick!
Frollo = Uber pyromaniac?
he should be a new meme. SHE'S A PONY! PONIES DONT LOVE!
I think Frollo has an obsession with fire.
A thousand? doesn't that seem a bit steep?
Wait shoulding the floor be burning as well?
excessive?
Kids need to be shown stuff of this quality.
05Custard: nope

Quasi's mom is dead
IDIOT IT IS WOOD FLOOR!

Meanwhile: "Kill, Maim, Destroy, Perform clever acts involving sleight of hands!"?
He seems like a bit of a pyromaniac.
Freefall29: thats the point

Quasi's mom cant be Esme
Frollo's Cutie Mark would be flame
alexxm i'm fine, thank you
Or else no kiss at the end.

Come to think of it, this movie was also made in the dark age of comics, which pretty much consumed all the other media. So even though this movie might be the darkest Disney Animated Musical of all time, it's probably STILL considered exclusively for little children without more onscreen kills than songs.

Steel thoughts. Steel thoughts.

In case of blade emergency
Emperor Frollo
Pointy end goes in the enemy. Pretty easy.
LEAVING SO SOON?
Quasimodo would never kill anyone.
Yes
She should've stayed dead, that would've been interesting... but it is disney
This reminds me of The Great MOuse Detective.

Sharp sword, man
What? Middle of a battle and that guy looks up? Why?
Jesus did he just wedge that thing straight into the stone?
And now the monster in Frolo is revealed and his own vices come to surface. I love it.
He can't equip swords, only maces!
must be a really sharp sword to make it half way through stone
that is one strong sword
NO
Time for the idiot to die :)

Like Gaston, in Beauty and the Beast. He dies because he dien't have enoug sense to give up.
AND PARIS SOMEHOW IS BETTER
:D
that got cleaned fast
He scored!!
11,01Wrek: It's more of Disney movies never having bad ends.
Silverscreen: ya
10/10
Damn
/me throwing popcorn in air
That was way brighter than the original tales ending.
where did the fire go?
Time skip from late evening to new morning?
they all died in the original
1,11in the book i mean.
good thing this is a movie, since catching a body falling that fast would've dragged him out the window too or snapped his back
suddenly, daytime
EVERYONE died in the original
/me gives fluttercry glasses
Hunchback of Notre Dame: Friendzone is Magic
SaxyPretender: never seen it
YAAAY!!
It's movie magic. I ani't got to explain carp.

Oh and they just happen to be waering white the colour of purity
Still stuck down there in the friendzone, sigh...
Silverscreen: He did.
OHHHHHHHHH
and then phoebes got aids from tapping the gypsy.
jkjk i love this movie
/me blinks
and the hero doesint get the girl.... THE END
By a factor of like four million/
damn
Silverscreen: Yes, along with Esmerelda.
All three of them died in the book
No fire.
Silverscreen: apparently
10/10
Bronysith: Hmm... then The Joker
KISS
Silverscreen: Yup. And everyone in Paris was a jerk, including the captain and Esmeralda.
No fire damage
Silverscreen: so did esmeralda
All fine.
11,01Or the protagonist dying.
This movie is strange, because the protaginist DOESN'T get the girl in the end.
You can come out.
WTF XD
Quasimodo: I can hit it whenever I want bros.
11,01It's for kids.
NO ONE DIES LIKE GASTON
The light
she grabbs the audience
he's the patro saint of freindzoned
Silverscreen: Quasi dies, The Gypsy suicdes
The sun, it burns!!
In the book he dies in the end because he crawls into her grave to be with her forver or something.
it burn's!!!!!!!
05,15I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass. And I'm all outta bubble gum
i am commander prickard :D
Dont throw shit...
Meanwile: very
Fun fact: In the book, Frollo and Esmerelda both die, and Quasi commits suicide
/me gasp
Do not throw shit
So yes.
Randomnerd: i love beauty and the beast
my eyes!
NO ONE FALLS LIKE GASTON
Pet the monster!
I thought I herd Esmerelda died in the book, but they made this one more lighthearted o3o
StinkomanFan: /)
Nittany_Discord: Yep. Hellfire's for kids. :D
eh, the protanost dying offers nothing, so why kill him
I can't decide who had the worst Disney death. Frollo fell into a pit of lava, Scar was eaten alive, Sykes (from Oliver & Company) got hit by a train. Disney was just violent.
I guess quasi is gonna be foreveralone.jpg
We should watch Them!
*heard
Frollo's dead, and everyone's happy now.
:D
lol.
so...much...d'awwwwwwwwwww
Well, for the time this movie came out, there isn't enough killing for this movie to be considered suitable for adults.
Bronysith: /)
And gypsies and malformed people were never hated or killed again. The end.
:)
YOU FEEL FUNNY MR>
This was on the Tvtropes pag.e

The moral of the story is that ugly guys can still be really nice... but won't be any of dat ass.

Creepy low res CGI people
And Frollo died, and they all lived happily ever after!! YAY
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the end of the film as the camera zooms out from Notre Dame cathedral, the pigeons all gather on Laverne again. She shoos them off and asks them if they ever migrate. The fact is, rock doves (the most common breed of pigeon seen in urban areas) do NOT migrate, at least not in the same sense other birds migrate. They may move from one part of a city to another,
Okay, I'm going for donuts now. Brb.

There were no sequels to Aladdin.
Nowhere NEAR the quality of the first movie (as most direct-tovideo Disney sequels are) but awesome nonetheless.
replay
THOU SHALT NOT MENTION THE SEQUELS!
The sequel of this movie sucked in my opinon
2nd Movie Jafar died when Iago destoryed his lamp
/me starts making muffins
Is anybody recording this to put on youtube?

Temple of doom wasn't as bad as Crystal Skull
