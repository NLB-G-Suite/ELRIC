twilight calls her a unicorn
WHERE DOES SHE CAME FROM
Equestria
actually i think she does call her a unicorn
05no fuckign allcaps.
^
^
and another time iirc
Not really something I was paying attention to tbh
has the name alicorn actully been used on the show
Why was alicorn chosen, by the way?
not sure
05all-corn
05its rather logical really
05take unicorn.
05remove uni
read the comments in link to understand
05add all
05allcorn
It seems too forced to me.
but imho thats a stupid name
PEGICORN
Hence, why I stick to alicorn despite my misgivings.
Lets call them magic
05all-in-one-corn
the word pegasi come from the mythical horse 'pegasus' isn it?
Mmm, corn
Indeed^
Radu: makes you think
Yeah it does
the image i meen
05its whats its called... prula?
05prural*
plural
Different kingdom.
05plural**
Got there in the end though :P
05another theory could be that theres a set of allinonecorns in each kingdom.
05equestria being the capital kingdom
I don't, since he did appear in a episode. :p
05due to sun & moon control
Could be me.
05what gave that away?
=o
05which once again makes its much more logical that candence originalyl was intended to be a unicorn
Maybe she used magic?
Yerp.
^
Truth.
05immortal does not mean unkillable
We're not getting anywhere discussing this xD
Id say its more logical to assume that only Luna and Celestia are the special immortal kind
perhaps shes a particully young alicorn then
05it just means that you wont die of natural casues
Let's just say Alicorn's are very rare -The End.
And Cadance has verifiably aged.
luna controls the moon, celestia controls the sun and cadance was left in charge of twilight /bad pun
She could be immortal, but she's also young.
Oh for-
Where'd she come from?
Wouldn't that make Celestia and Luna... well, unaging then? Because otherwise they'd be kinda degenerate by this point. :P
usually immortals stop aging at some point though
Well... Celestia is over 1000 years old.. isnt she? xD
Luna too for that sake.
If not older.
Since she was trapped on the moon for 1000 years
I'd say she is 2012 years old, tbh
/me slaps back
Ow.
Season 2.
I mean look at the difference :)
I forgot Luna was IN season 1.
For about, 40 collective seconds.
Well, Luna never grew to Celestia's stature.
season 2 luna has more of a personality is season 2
:3
I want another Luna episode.
05meh, candence was a fluke that grew wings. she wont become older than any other unicorn.
05a freak of nature
I like Luna and Celestia being special, and alicorns other than them just rare
05due to inbreeding
Uhoh.
xDD

Wow, no actual all-caps.

05its the print
05specialyl if its a laserjet
05the ink for those are expensive as shit
hmm still pricy though
But the shipping in US is free ;_;
Pricey spicey.
why do i have to live in england
0544$ is only 300SEK roughly.
Try norway -.-
need to get going, later everypony
I'm failing at writing the conclusion
Try Eastern Europe
05so its ratehr cheap
bye
I have 1130 words
Bye
need to write a conclusion to end the thing
dunno how to write it
shepard is a one man army here
I dont get.. why dont they hit his head? xD
aliens
Because they're videogame AI
XD
A duuuuuuh
/me is sad.
its ok we'll live
Hahaha, its like.. I can see his helmt... SHOOT THE ITEM HES HIDING BEHIND x)
we got movie night
I know, but I still don't know if I should buy it or not. I mean, I'm afraid for the imperfections
its wierd how the enimes dont go next to him!
here a t-shirt is $25 shipping cost another $25 plus taxes a 30% of the total
As i have explained that emma is a biatch and that hanging with friends is for pussys, I conclude that emma is a <censored>
I guess you have...

:(
Epic. Shit. Ftw.
xD
Nuke to the face.
lol
yep
05ima gona place an order on WLF. and see the total price.
pwease :)
last word
Bugger
Do it for the community! xD
Since you're a few countries away from me
05thing is i dont like any of them
There should be a lottery when movies and episodes are picked for movie night, where someponies can win prizes.
woo
is it country locked though?
Also, there's the promo code EQUESTRIA10 for a 10% discount
on WLF
Radu: Good to know!
But 10% on a $25 T shirt is only $2.5
... That IS 2.5$... Think of all the treasures you can buy *-*
two things from poundland xD
I'm camping WLF, waiting for another 25% discount soon
I have guestimated that I need to spend at least 100 bucks US on merch in order for a WLF order to be worth it for me. To balance out the shipping expense that is. =/
Yeah, I didn't think it through.
Radu: Soviet Sweden.
Soviet Sweden?
Lol Soviet sweeden.. xD
Oh, Sweden
spiders.txt
I want prizes though.....
... Sweedes...
The shipping for T Shirts in Europe is about $15-$25
Makin jokes of us norwegians! D=
:O
Shipping would make it impossible.
speaking of Sweden
05norr eller söderöver?
/me Swedish Spitfire~melts

Good luck, Twi_Fi!c:

Yeah. Best of luck
It is brutal.

I want myself the fluttershy bag... Sooo baaaad.
O, I thought you were just checking the shipping price
utf-8 encoding in my irc client: check
okay 1202 words
finally done
now to format the stupid thing
05whats the point if i dont like any of them? no reason to buy then
Perhaps there'll be one released soon
I think I'll acquire myself some funds to get all kinds of various merch from various places and ship it all via jetcarrier or something... We'll see.
/me claps
06Make the conclusion a "tl;dr: drugs are bad, m'kay" or something for bonus points.

Oh, crap

Give up smoking :)

I also need to acquire myself a steady source of income. Easier said than done unfortunately. =(
Well, there are pills for giving up smoking
Not sure if they actually have effect, though

05but since they are easely replaced
Hey ponypeeps

it only works if I use popout
Also, you can get a 10% discount on the T Shirt with the EQUESTRIA10 promo code, just saying. It's just about $3 economy, but any bit matters
and replacement nibs and such isn't that much i believe also
05Radu: i based with that one
Oh

hosts
FYI the graves are in the ground.
x) Epic
type part of their name then tab
lol
i have the hosts file open
Didnt work i think
I just type in the name and use :
there shouldn't be too much in that file on a home computer
Is there anything after that?
Ooo Okei xD
"This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one# space."
._.
then it shows examples
Yes. Yes it did.
Oh? It did? xD
Are there any not hashed out (#) comments?
The colon isn't necessary. Just the name.
just local host
Well, at least we know that isn't the problem.

Well, my brother liked it.

It's something different.
And I hate it.
I'm still freaking out now xD
Because it's got the same name as something I like.

And has nothing to do with it.

03y u no have parent drive you
Can anyone link the safe website to download the desktop pony app?
Oi.
Well tbh WC3. Iv'e owned it since it's release and I still play atleast 5 hours a week. My record was 2 years ago during Winter holidays. 300 hours in 3 weeks XD
Oi the licking

Don't lick me.
o.o
Ow.

Two licks at the same time?
I only bought MW3 for the survival mode XD
Ehhh. Not bad, I suppose.
CoD is such a boring series now... like most FPS games
CoD ewww
?
woot ty lonleymare :3

Best one.
14how are you? :3
CoD went downhill after CoD5 WaW

that's the point
03the usual
you like the genre
Whats Desktop Ponies? o.o
14D:
14don't worry, I'll be more active here from the next week, I swear
03did I say it had anything to do with you?
/me runs
It's meant to be a continuation along the same theme
/me shudders
Or they wouldn't just be called MW1, MW2, MW3, etc.
I'm way to lazy to do anything like that.
But it'd be a good idea
It was awesome!
Well, TBH I think CoD graphics are all worse past MW2
MW2 still had best IMO
14x3
I dont play many shooters..
TBH CoD graphics is just Quake 3 with added visuals.
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3oek3t/
you know, ir eally doubt the exp gain and pison glands from these are worth the enormous ammo-amounts
03heh whatever
Biggest problem in modern FPS games. You don't get to play with people on the same level as you
XD
Hardly their fault if people are willing to buy it
03I need to go turn in some forms
03so that I can host my radio show tomorrow

You don't need chest armour for painballing
They just bruise
03also wtf?
I just don't get how he managed to get that badly hurt though
Don't molest ponies.
14lol

Just gain weight. Then you don't need chest armor.

they never said it though
Celestia is older than Granny Smith

1,3Celestia and Luna are immortal, but not -all- alicorns are explicitly immortal
Or at the very least... elf-like

dunno why but i like this pic : http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/173498
sometimes I hate when fanon tries to be canon, really confusing
not really
Then again, Faust was surprised they made Cadance as an alicorn
Hmmmm...
/me pies everypony in here
Havea pie

They probably made her an alicorn to go with the action, at times she needs to fly and at times she needs to use magic.
