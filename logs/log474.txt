It was a really great scene
XD
*falls off of wall into Mongolia* See ya kid!
00,02SuperBrony64, seems legit
Remember kids: the Great Wall was also made with several bodies of the deceased workers

05hes getting a bit old though
You know. This movie doesn't suck.
Yup. The essential part of the training montage is for him to fail at something at first, then win epically at it later on.
No fun for you, Meiling.

Miyagi was very much the old Mentor figure. he taught Daniel, and acted as a father. With Han, it's more akin to a brotherly relationship, since they both help eachother with their own struggles.

That 3 way TOTALLY didn't happen
My fancanon: Those stallions actually have an intense inferiority complex from their dead-end jobs that they release in a well-received shoegaze band.

Gypsy Pinkie Predicts it in a brew :O
Well the first part of the name could create an akward situation if my non-borny friend finds this out
In the meantime, I should probably be working on my own fic.

NIGHT MAN
Nittany isnt streaming?
I'd totally stream if I could.
I dont want it to end, but how long this is taking is making me think it has
Also helps if you have a drill handy.
11,01Give me a bit.
0,14shoot
11,01Thanks.
Shoot, RAWRity/
Basically, 100 people across the country wake up, with the nmber 100 branded on their arm, and each slowly develop the ability to create objects out of nothing.
ok
i missed u :(
lol
Make it 108 for the symbolism.
Welp.
:)
I like it.
:(
Wait a bit. He should be on soon.
Look at this picture I found! http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/#/d520zb9
Mind if, in turn, I run an idea by you guys that I'm currently working on?
does enypony hear like gozilla movies
Might as well get some Mods before the stream starts again
0,14go ahead
Are you done?
yes
eeeeyup
1) I don't 2) Read 3) Fanfics
It's a great idea.
0,14>Calvinball
1) why are you reading this?
Anyway, my idea.
Well, that's the point.
He thinks he's a superhero
plus, I figured "Genesis" would fit thematically with the powers of creation.
Cool. Anyway, idea is great. Go for it.
This is adorable :) http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/#/d520zb9
cool.
Now let's here yours.
Burn him!
i dont like being burned
WOW!! ....that pick is adorable :)
I'm actually afraid of being burned, especially after the last cooking incident.
He is to paint the vaguely-defined "essence" of a pony.
yeah i think i burn my face way to much i might get it :/
1,11Guys...I gotta go.
Initially he panics, but then sets down to do it.
/me waves bye
He needs a subject, though. Somebody simple, but not dull. Colours without depth, to make his job easier.
11,01So I can help raise $2,250 for others.
Of course Rainbow Dash flies by, right at that moment.
Derpy?
From there, I would use this viewpoint to investigate Rainbow Dash's character.
I like it.
It's kind of an in-depth character study of Dash.
Currently he won't let me take a pee till I give him his money.
Gotta have my daily dose of creepypasta now
HELLO!
It's an interesting way to explore and break down one of the Mane 6's characters, while offering a unique viewpoint on it.
What's creepypasta?
Oooooh are we talking about Creepy pasta? Also, hi there people.
creepypasta?
BYE
Um ok lol
lol
It can explore and address a lot of the fandom's on perceptions on Rainbow, while letting such references feel natural and organic.
