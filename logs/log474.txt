You know. This movie doesn't suck.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Before the tournament, Han (Jackie Chan) gives Dre (Jaden Smith) a shirt to compete in. Dre comments that the shirt is just like one that Bruce Lee wore. One of Jackie Chan's early breaks in movies was to be a stunt coordinator in Lee's films; Chan also had small parts in Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon.

Hello TheRainbowDash.
Miyagi was very much the old Mentor figure. he taught Daniel, and acted as a father. With Han, it's more akin to a brotherly relationship, since they both help eachother with their own struggles.

Dat StinkomanFan
2,14 Of course, she has no idea what's about to happen

damn
DIRTY SONS OF BITCHESSHIT
They are bored! XD
There goes a quarter of the film's budget.
SOMEONE COUNT ALL THE EXPLOSIONS
Then a cat explodes by touching the water
Michael Bay just orgasmed

More explosions than a Michael Bay movie
How many C4 packs did they have? 100?

DeathStar: hi silly
Luna: ty for everything you have done. When i first arrived at bronystate, you welcomed me with open arms, well hooves. You were very kind to me and this whole site that you work on is amazing. you mean so much to me. I hope to talk with you more. May the force guide you on your journey throughout life.

They demand justice?
What sort of a nickname is "Dirty"?
Is it just me, or is the speech out of sync with the lip flaps?
They need Pheonix Wright.
SirGanjalf: That's the zone with the most amount of...action....in it.:D
K_A: Yeah, but it's what they're called.
RanYakumo: many things
RanYakumo: Dirty is short for Dirty Dan
If Requium for a Dream gets through, then Hobo with a Shotgun should get through
In deh Blue zone
Oh and yes, Reikim, I think it would be an A movie.
Herriman from Fosters?
SunderlandPony89: wasnt requiem an A movie?
0,14well, maybe
And, here's the part in BMN when I get tired.
you often end in the blue zone...in night springs....
(Didn't stop us from using "coolies" as an slang word back in the early '00s.)
Bronysith: Yeah. But still.
K_A: Go to Google and type coolie hat.
This shall now be the standard for B movies
Ninjazz: Oh! Thanks. I put it down as a B-movie anyway, just to be sure. Used the precedent of Evil Dead.
Oh. Of course the guy who survives is the best of the group.
Most of the stores selling them refer to them as such.
Why can't it ever be the worst?
Hobo with a Shotgun for B movie
^
I second that
Reikim: Budget looked like it would be a B movie. Plus it's not that old.
Yay!
But what about that drink?
Bubba Ho-tep for B
Im betting he goes all rambo and hunts them down and kills him
2nded
A*
hmm ..... I cant shake this feeling that this might represents Rambo for some reason, I place 50 bits that im right
Reikim: whats up
DocSane: Well the Wikipedia article is the first result. I'm just saying that could get some bad press from PC-pushers.
Machete was the definition of a B movie
1,11That colnol's got one hell of a frog in his throat.
The helicopter squad? Sounds made up.
Dat stache
This guy is evil because of his gravelly oice.
Darf, it's pretty much Rambo with Reb Brown
Bronysith: Nothin' much. Brony movie night, and I'm late as always, but that's perfectly okay.
Well... I guess it is, being a movie and all.
That face, not cool.
no touchy
his damn army...is also your army...just saying
It does sound a lot better than "conical Asian hat," though.
NO
no?
Slowter: Hobo with a Shotgun has a much better B movie feel then Machete. Not to say that Machete is bad or anything
How about Guinea Pig for B movie?
Fuck this is such a rambo rip-off
I would say so Sunderland
gotcha
Murrican!
I still can't tell if that's a boy or a girl.
how about the Wizard?

Basically, the US and Russia couldn't fight eachother, because both sides had enough nukes to blast the planet back into the stone age, and declaring war would mean destroying most of humanity. So instead, they passive-aggresively fought eachother through other skirmishes by supporting different sides in Viet Nam and Korea.

WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO HIT HIM WITH A ROCKET?
RAWRity: We sure shot ourselfs in the foot there
Jeez man, calm down! XD
:D
00,03Campers-_-
SHOOT!
lets waste all of our ammo on one guy
1,11Yes, keep aiming for the spot five feet behind him.
Terrible aim !
:)
Protip, aim ahead of him
00,10the dam round would tumble in the launcher if ti was that large
Confirmed man>mortars
Reikim: Afghanistan was The Taliban.
Derp
/me learned how to do a Moartar explosion sound effect in Audio Production class.
can't they aim ahead?
11,01Precise, but not accurate.
Matrix
Silverscreen: that spot deserved it
Sumica: if only they showed that
We screwed up, but that's to be expected
there goes the entire budget
There goes a sixteenth of the film's budget.
And we're sure this isn't a comedy?
He is a constant speed moving target, that's so easy to hit !
Reikim: The one that we're never gonna win
Dat slo mo
shoot in front of him not at him
Silverscreen: cool!
RAWRity: There we go. Took a while for me to remember.
fluttercry, xXxSc00t_C0mm4nd0xXx: True... But that doesn't mean everyone camps with it.
lol
00,03They need to get Steady aim Pro -_-
no fair
DEAAAAAAGHHHHH
Can we move on to the corny Italian movie?
05,15BLAAAAAA
Whenever I use slow projectile I always aim where my enemy used to be
lol
Uuuhgaaahahah!
who taught these guys how to shot
Its like hitting a ant with a rock from 30 feet away
AAAA
00,10you have to lead your target when fireing slow shots
REB BROWN SCREAMS YES
How much of the budget is left?
RanYakumo: and the first 15/16th's of it was on the opening scene
Irish_Pony: bed guys can't aim you should know this
So who picked this movie?
otakon Pretty much lol
00,10nice job clustering
DIVE CAPTAIN, DIVE DIVE DIVE!
:D
00,03They have the aim of Storm Troopers!
Dialouge written by Sweetie Belle
Reikim: its going to involve. magic. swords. machinery and guns etc. lol. my book
LOL MODERN DAY SAW
Irish_Pony: bad*
bahahaha
aiming at the exact spot he currently is didn't work for some reason
Group together, best tactical decision
SunderlandPony89: more like we stuck our foot into a meat grinder, then undercooked the resulting meat, ate it, and got explosive diarhea and botulism from the meal.
00,10that guy is pro with the SAW
/me puts his shirt back on
slow motion too XD
I just somehow knew as soon as I saw the open field that it would be moartars and not rifles.
Bronysith: dishonored?
0,14o_o
Godo old startrooper AI
The Vietnam War went down just like this, right?
and they all fall down
05,15Dat stock footage of the war
Sumica: Thats a M60 Silly :P
So yeah, whoever asked, all of the armed conflicts during the Cold War were really USSR vs. NATO
RAWRity: Hell of an analogy
otakon: wat?
RAWRity, can we just get back to nam?
hahaha, HE has steady aim pro
Did the yjust use the same clip of the guys dying TWICE
00,10yeah SAW
/me dances on Midnight_Tempest s head
Hello repeat footage
RAWRity: What a vivid analogy
one bullet = 5 dead people at the same time
they didn't have SAW back then
StinkomanFan: Nam was fucked up.
LOL
19 and things like that
small explosion, larger kill radius
Yankee Exactly lol
/me 11,01firess
I wouldn't be surprised
05,15I love how they just keep taking footage from the actual war. CHEEEEAP

otakon: Dishonored looks pretty good so far
NOW
Charge at him and dont fire!
REALLU?!
They had M60's.
DuskStarshimmer: oww :'(
We'll cover you
AH GET TO DAH CHOPER
no they had no saw and they still use the m60 as well
Yep. They just run at the bullets
Bronysith: it's a game coming out, it's called Dishonored. It's basically steampunk elder scrolls with H.P. Lovecraftian inspired psychic powers
I SUDDENLY CAN BACK
Sumi wasn't implying M249?
USSR supported Communist dictators, NATO supported capitalist dictators, either way you got dictators in power.
Murder in the rice patty
Movie's over
lol
They never return fire...
sorry DeathStar, :( I ddint mean to hurt you
If you want an interesting view of Viet Nam, I'd suggest reading "The Things They Carried"
hop hop hop
what happened to everybody else that he was trying to save?
hup hup hup
Bronysith: It's also looking dark as hell in it's tone
Bigger than a SAW, but Sgt. Rock could fire it one-handed.
otakon: So it's like Cthulhu Tech, only Steampunk?
/me dances with DeathStar on his head.
sagas they have no bullets
11,01Now for boring parts.
I guess they want to hit them with there sword
DuskStarshimmer: it's okey :)
"Stop swaying your butts"?

sunufabitch.
RAWRity: OH LAWDY that's a good book! And I'm not just saying that becaus ethe author is from my home town! :P
otakon: is that steampunk?
And now? All those problems in the Middle East? Direct result of the Cold War. Yes, we're STILL dealing with the fallout from WWII, which was itself fallout from WWI.

Bronysith: steampunk is elaborate technology that looks very ornate and "old-fashioned"
Reikim: if only Archduke Ferdinand had been able to dodge that bullet.
Ransome
And we can't just sit out of it because people might attack us again
OR NOT
Anyone else here a Brony? No one probably is.
sagas they read the script before hand. Told em to do it.
RAWRity: TO THE DELOREAN
One of the bravest men. In this regiment.
sadly thay lost

RAWRity, to his credit he dodged the first one
oh god... this movie looks horrible...
RAWRity: he would have if he had a Magnetic Chapeau
"Surprise, I'm communist now"
I calls him Mike Handsome
I just found out my dog died
Yeah, I'm Communist!

RAWRity: If only he could of taken that bullet
RAWRity: Would have happened anyway. The Serbs and Aurstians were itching for a fight
Barbetos: Oh so the fourth wall approach
Bronysith: You're making FF6/7
I got bored of this movie a bunch of times and walked around a bit to take break from sitting.
While I was at basic

I learned from Freud.
I can't clop to this
TEA IS BETTER THAN COFFEE!!
Time travel is useful.
Vietnam war- Rambo and 500,000 other similar war movies, World War III-Sensationlist movies on futuristic technology, explosions with Michael Bay directing, and..well, a lot of hype in it also.
I can.
Dusk: I can
Send in the stock footage to save $$$
So much stock footage!
Don't like coffee.
Look at all this stock. I can make chicken soup at of that.
Mr Sex with his own mother himself :s
When did this movie start?
Reikim: the dr proved that to us all
Athgaar, Dominic Riiiiiiiiiiight
This movie was ah- behind of its time.
The real question is when will it end?
Unless it's 33% milk and 33% sugar.
Cup of tea + laptop + several hours of free time = unlimited creative potential.
With plenty of cheese
00,03This is SOOO not MLG PRO :|

What is wrong with this movie?
fluttercry: it's over, he won

Midnight_Fyre: You're probably right on that count. The Korean War didn't ahve nearly the same level of infamy. Still doesn't.
I hated Soul Eater
*4 Hours Later* So Princess_Molestia did you have a good time?
nope.avi

what just happened?
fucking heros were annoying
I mean it's not like Anime is all one big genre with only 1 type of show.
I wanna thank the Bronystate staff for forgiving me and I wanna apologize for acting like a prick before. I'm just so happy to talk to you wonderful people again
Tell me you didn't love that, though, TRD|ProCommando?
Oh gosh, he's going to pull a Colombine on Saigon.
00,10again with shooting up the walls
Now this is rambo...
now he's going to Disneyland!!!
soul eater is a fairly simple fighting show
We have to replay those gibberish scenes
Can we have a Best Movie Clause?

RIDICK
otakon: Oh. now that you put it like that.
RADDDDDIK

Hello Rambo

Good lord I've acted more sensibly than this during road rage.
Naruto was stupid as well

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
wtf?
I'm right here
TRAITORRRRRR
Ninjazz: It was implemented, but not for a welly thought of cause.
Reb Brown sings your greatest hits: RRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Soul Eater is by-the-books Shonen filler.
Kill ALL the things!
This guy has anger problems and it gets him in trouble
lol
Naruto is the same type of anime as soul eater
THE WAR IS NEVER OVER
Shoot ALL the expesive hardware
Google him
Come to think of it, I can only think of one movie about the War of 1812, and that was from the 50s or sometime like that
ah, FLCL
brb
Princess_Molestia: So how you like the Irish Pride?
GOD I LOVE THAT SHOW
05,15HOW DID HE KILL THE RUSSIAN?
dat sumbitch
I can find him because I'm REB BROWN!
pony_300: Selling now in his 15,000 other sets of screaming hits.
00,10I wonder if mst3k did this movie.......probably not.
He's gunna kill him
this guy has PTSD. he should take some MDMA
TRD|ProCommando: You gotta let your primal urges wash over you and SCREAM, sometimes, Dashie.
I need to watch that
if its the last thing he ever does.
fluttercry: He threw him off a waterfall.
Great
I'm gonna kill him. Even if it kills me.
i have a friend for dinner *cue lecter*
fluttercry: he instantly threw him over a waterfall
Spoony did this
First anime that really made me go "WTF" and tilt my head to it.
00,10I am sure that's all that would have come up in a search if they had
StinkomanFan: there is more than shounen fighting anime
fluttercry: after a punch
Goooinnn on a jet plane. I dun know when I'll be back again.
now, whos next?
Ninjazz: I don't scream, I am well-minded.
Medaka...That sounds like Madoka
Manila TODA Y
and the dub isn't half bad either
Manila
fluttercry: Isnt it simple? He scared him to death...
Oh, today!
05,15TODAY
I Like The M60 C:
Why are we supposed to think the Russian is dead?
Reikim: eh?
I did like One Piece though
GAIZ, THIS MOVIE IS TAKING PLACE IN REAL LIFE RIGHT NOW.
He fell like 30 feet into water.
what? as in right now?
StinkomanFan: check out Serial Experiments Lain
05,15....what is this movie's today
teaspoon of Manila. add a little more........
RAWRity: I defend it as being made on alcohol for the purpose of crossing every single line imaginable.
Hey kids! Flare is back! :D
00,10nice dictator shades
TRD|ProCommando: Having a hard time believing that....
Inconspicuous.
Princess_Molestia: Too bad I didnt show you the Marine Pride.....
RanYakumo: sure...

Manila became Womanila *deletes comment*
He's at a Top Airport...
Howdy FlareChaser.

Like a boss
Meanwhile: Hm?
Top..... Airport....
or Vega, pick your country.
I haven't even checked the name of this movie. I got disctracted by the dubstep drop all over the current poster.
WallDives: Yes! Yes!
....I SAID, Flare. is. BACK :|
wb FlareChaser
that's where I saw it
Reikim: you pinged me. Why?
DeathStar: Totally legit, man.
Ninjazz: Whatever you think, okay, but whatever it is that is against me, it is false.
otakon: Great news. English dub is happening.
One Piece had good heros, a good plot, and excellent jokes
Hey Flare.
00,10boi?
Reikim: THEY DON'T NEED ONE
I can't get over that waterfall out of nowhere.
Hello FlareChaser!

Meh.

Sumica: They are prescription.

You had your tim, now it's somepony else's time, dont be selfish.
SaxyPretender: I KNOW RIGHT?!

It's like all the good of anime with very little bad
asian stock market?
I think the universe is trying to tell me something, but I dont know WHAT.
hi |Discord|
0,14when does the DVD come out again?
Ninjazz: Well, according to Dashie standards, it starts out as your opinion as flase.
*false
Princess_Molestia: Well then Ill see you next week then........
Awesomelly, because of this movie
hai Discord
The movie really should have ended by now, you know?
hai |Discord|
SaxyPretender: Not. Soon. Enough.
So, who's next.
YOu wnat anime that "crosses the line"? Excel Saga. It was expressly made JUST to test what they could get away with on Japanese TV.
/me crys tears of jow
DocSane: eeyup
Oh great a thunderstorm is coming and it already dimmed the lights.
WALA MERON
00,10this bit adds so much to the movie
WALA
*joy
Sure they still suffer a bit of DBZ syndrome but other than that it was good
|Discord| don't watch the movie. It makes you forget.
Docsane: We've got at least another 20 minutes to go I think.
00,10like 5 min
Now the movie is padding
What on earth is going on.
moo
RAWRity: one better, Puni Puni Poemy
I don't even know anymore.
HOLY CRAP TALKING
Know any Horror Anime?
RAWRity: Ah, yes. FLCL if it was 26 episodes and given a shot of LSD to go with the crack.
moo
TRD|ProCommando: Rarity standards over shadow Dashie's by a mile. I don't know what you're talking about. ;)
DeathStar: I am proud to say you have danced on my head. Now let us sing the song of our people.
It's been padding for 10 minutes
Hell, the last ep of Excel Saga had them making fun of a terrorist attack that killed hundreds of people.
wait what?
Anypony, ill be gentel.
Meanwhile: Really, just close your eyes, and let the audio sink into the mind only.
cock fighting
RanYakumo: Seriously? Wow...
COCK FIGHT
cockfight
And no, Death Note doesn't count
Illegal Scootaloo Fights
At all
0,14there's lot of Horro Anime
Ninjazz: u funny mang ^^
lool
Ninjazz: Eh, forget you then.
Horro
0,14and Higurashi
SCOOTALOO FIGHT
RAWRity: especially the last episode, which couldnt be aired because it crossed the line too much
05,15Ghost Stories is best Anime
00,10buck the russans
Ur just chikken
Now, let's decide who's cock is stronger!
Samurai Jack could beat both of those chickens
StinkomanFan: There's at least one I read...Higurashi does count, although it's not my thing
CloverMuffins: What doesn't Dashie love?
how were they allowed to film a cock fight?
0,14oh right
im scared theres talking in here...
/me sings the song of our people with RanYakumo
Why are there two Scootaloos fighting?
Reikim: nah. Excel Saga was essentially just really random. FLCL was anything BUT random.
NOPE
What're we watching?
CloverMuffins: *Love* Hint Hint.
nopony? really?
NOPE
"Screw the Russians" should be the tagline of this film.
Must be Stock Footage
00,10the two white guys kinda stand out
same way they filmed the shirtless headbutt
NONE
DocSane: The movie's 104 minutes. We started around 6:52 or so I think.
Can't cover OR protect him.
SunderlandPony89: i will END YOU!
wow this cock fight is big
Strike Commando
I am happy to even know you guys. So many nice people in this room. SO what movie is this?
Dat kick
RAWRity: Point taken. Sitll love both to bits, though.
This feels like it's been on a lot longer than it actually has
Evil_Spike: Thank you

Ghosties: You make that sound bad, the ending.
Is that a crying face?
SunderlandPony89: cause you insulted scoots

Bandana mode? Uh-oh, badass in the house.

CloverMuffins: Nevermind, it would make some ponies in here angry. >_>
StinkomanFan: no, but it needs to happen
I think he hod grudges a little too long

Saxy, you do indeed make a point.
You rock!
and the art is better
Rarity is awful in this one.
The thousands of textured rainbow glow effects on a black background and random raps about Rainbow Dash are due to this amazing ep.
DocSane: for a Flash animated show it is very good looking
Rainbow Dash.exe has encountered a problem with Windows
woohoo

And then a meme was born.

so time travel is involved
So much exposition. Most cartoons do not even bother explaining that stuff.
oh wrong quote
pinkie is best pony
How'd you do that?
CloverMuffins: from my genius intellect
Ingwaz: Indeed! ;)
What makes a spell hard or easy?

We need to air A Dog And Pony Show sometime, just so I can joke about how Spike is obsessed with Rarity's jewels.
9900 Mana
Alister: hiya man
Pinkie Pie said that RD is the ONLY one to pull it off, not just the only living one. The legendary nature is because RD did it before.
TheRainbowDash: fine :|
Ingwaz: genius indeed. u need to apply for MENSA or sth
i love her face
Rarity is donating her body for SCIE- ....err I mean MAGIC!!
TheRainbowDash: Without her, Dashie wouldn have gotten the award. Dashie OWES Rarity.
DuskStarshimmer: (\
/me hugs Alister
/me noms kirzstryfe

Pinkie is the deepest character on this show. Rarity is the most complicated.

But can't unicorns levitate with thei magic all the fucking time?
08,01so my friend's fiancee was asking whether i need to lose weight to fit into my kilt (i've gained about 4 stone since i moved away from Edinburgh)
Magic solves all problems

She can also push back Smooze with those wings... if it doesn't belong to Marvel.
Pinkie doesnt need the spell
08,01to which i replyed: http://i.imgur.com/Ohuwm.png
CloverMuffins: Unjustified zeal just gets on my nerves. Sorry if I'm pissing someone off. :|
Lambo: no they can't, it's very hard to levitate yourself
otakon: the damn baby pulls it off all the time
Lambo: would most likely require some regular concentration, not the easiest thing to do, not to mention levitating 2 others at the same time at all times
Lambo: prodigy
we need to return to Cloudsdale Season 3
Doctor Whooves?
the only city in the sky...
whats up TheRainbowDash
Dat Rarity...

Huh, I wonder wherer that Jackhammer falled a _ *gets hit by Jackhammer*
The Rainbow Factory
otakon: For pegasi.
Rthe only city in the sky...
otakon: no, that's tails
Ingwaz: maybe for this episode, but Rarity or Twilight Sparkle could have needed short period flying before, but then they didn't use it...
otakon: No. wings = boners
Ninjazz: apparently

To everypony, yes, I am so slow and derp.:D

I wonder how Derpy did?
Her only rival in pure fun-ness, that I know of, is Vic Mignogna.
Ingwaz: :D
TheRainbowDash: Two words. Sonic Bubbleboom.
I really wanted to see Derpy do her turn
She's also apparently the one who points out all the double entendres in the script during recording sessions.

08,01so on the document for speeches at the wedding, she has put this down next to best man (my) speech: "All bridesmaids, please read it beforehand, and keep a spare copy just in case he forgets it."
Crippler: Celestia's royalty, of course she does nothing. That's there job, to do nothing. Like Ulfrec. He does nothing all day whilst I one-man-army the empire.
00,03That reminds me of My Little Dashie...
DASHIE!!!!! :3

CloverMuffins: I know, right?! Wub her so much.

>Someone stops streaming
My first fic was a TTGL fic where Kamina dies in the first battle, and would have gone on to create a whole 'nother universe and destroy it JUST to explain one stupid little thing in canon. It wasn't that bad, actually, though I'd probably write it differently today.

On the wallpaper is an image of Applejack, Fluttershy, Twilight Sparkle, Trixie, Derpy Hooves, Rarity, Octavia, Vinyl Scratch, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Lyra and Bon Bon the fillies. The fillies are in various poses. The artwork relates to the foalhood of the ponies in the year 1037.
CloverMuffins: That over-representation.
And could beat full-grown teachers in duels.

One of them actually becomes deluded, and attemtps to become a super hero, taking on the name "Genesis" and fighting the other competitors because he's convinced they're super villains.
Reikim: sure
i have had th e gurren lagan theme stuck in my head all day
Ah
geeky-brony, eeeyup :)
TOY_PON32: i see
Ninjazz Never heard of that one.
Are you done?
/me has a lovely bunch of cocunuts
0,14also, I'm liking the idea, RAWRity
yes
eeeeyup
1) I don't 2) Read 3) Fanfics
It's a great idea.
The long-ass one with nix or something
0,14>Calvinball
1) why are you reading this?
In place of Genesis, though, you could use something else that signifies "The End".
sagas: Past Sins? :S
Paladin_Drakkenwolf Both of those are good.
dat Tov|Calvinball
TOY_PON32: because you wrote it
Genesis has too many positive connotations, unless you're goign to use it.
Ninjazz Where can i find it?
Anyway, my idea.
Madagascar In a nutshell Hey everyone a VIRUS THAT DOES NOTHING will get into our country shut down everthing
Ninjazz: Yes! Never had the stamina to finish it through though
Well, that's the point.
DeathStar: Erm..I guess your right lol
Ah, I see.
He thinks he's a superhero
blarg soo tired from being in the sun all day
plus, I figured "Genesis" would fit thematically with the powers of creation.
/me noms popcorn "I love the buffershow <3"
Cool. Anyway, idea is great. Go for it.
cool.
DaringDude: Ooo getting your tan on bro?
Now let's here yours.
/me 11,01shines on DaringDude
DaringDude: I hear ya on that one.
Burn him!
i dont like being burned
Hey Everlasting_Joy :D
I had an idea for an MLP fanfic one day. Randomly dropped into my head with the phrase "all the colours of the rainbow".
Howdy TOY_PON32!
DeathStar: I know, right? It spins and spins and spins and spins and spins...
WOW!! ....that pick is adorable :)
/me puts on some Nittany_Discord Screen
DaringDude Me neither.
Gamer_Luna: =_(\
This little plot bunny gathered into something rather nice.
Gamer_Luna: Ha Ha. I like gridmark and all but come on. That is nothing
luckily im quite tan already so only my face burns
I'm actually afraid of being burned, especially after the last cooking incident.
The story follows a painter, a student at the Equestrian Royal Academy of the Arts in Canterlot
TOY_PON32: What's new with you? It's been a while since you've been on here.
In order to ascend to the rank of master, he is given a test.
DaringDude: Careful bro you don't want to get skin cancer
CloverMuffins: you should see season 2 I don't wanna spoil anything but the dots spin
He is to paint the vaguely-defined "essence" of a pony.
DeathStar: holy sh*t! nowai!! :O
CloverMuffins: soz youtube wasn't working, could you give me that link again?
he fails and is sent back to Art Kindergarten
CloverMuffins: ikr?
yeah i think i burn my face way to much i might get it :/
So he's shipped to Ponyville, given some money and as much time as he likes to complete the assignment.
1,11Guys...I gotta go.

Initially he panics, but then sets down to do it.
i should stop with all this water polo not helpful with the sunburn dilema

Hi Everybrony. How is everyone on this HORRIBLE night?
11,01Everyone. If you want to help me with something (financially) I want to get for our next fundraiser (it's in the newsletter), PM me. I would super-appreciate some help. I only need a $150 max.
Aircrafter Well-fed and heartbroken.
TOY_PON32: Oh not much. I've read too many creepypastas so I can't get any sleep.
11,01So I can help raise $2,250 for others.
Aircrafter: why horrible?
DeathStar: I am, but Im also getting impacient
Then he says "buck it" and just draws R34 ponies on the internet
Of course Rainbow Dash flies by, right at that moment.
Derpy?
Aircrafter: Wow
CloverMuffins: Cause I owe Slenderman 20 dollars.
Everlasting_Joy: Thanks
DeathStar: Oh well. Chat is good enough for me
From there, I would use this viewpoint to investigate Rainbow Dash's character.
hi Aircrafter a horrible night to have a curse right?
I like it.
If I have any money this month that I can throw at you, I will Nitt.
CloverMuffins: thankyou muchly :)
Aircrafter: oh u fk'd :d
So true cachi01|MW3.
DualShock: npnp :)
It's kind of an in-depth character study of Dash.
Aircrafter Heartbroken is... good? 6_9
/me dances on sagas s head "yay ^-^"
Currently he won't let me take a pee till I give him his money.
Gotta have my daily dose of creepypasta now
HELLO!
Aircrafter: lol i remember y first creepypasta night... its freaking scary xd
hello TrollTerrorist
It's an interesting way to explore and break down one of the Mane 6's characters, while offering a unique viewpoint on it.
DeathStar: why so awesome
I'M A TROLL TERRORIST!
What's creepypasta?
Oooooh are we talking about Creepy pasta? Also, hi there people.
creepypasta?
TrollTerrorist: I can see that o.o
BYE
Hello Solargirl.
Aircrafter Are you a Vorcha?
TrollTerrorist... welcome.
DO NOT GO TO CREEPYPASTA,YOUNG FILLY!
geeky-brony: /)^3^(\ i dunno
At the same time I make a point regarding people in general: that no matter how simple they appear, all people are far too complex to properly express in a single picture, sentence, word, whatever.
Um ok lol
lol
Why not, Gamer_Luna
I desire to watch more ponies. I DEMAND PONIES. Youtube is waiting...
but Gamer_Luna
It can explore and address a lot of the fandom's on perceptions on Rainbow, while letting such references feel natural and organic.
