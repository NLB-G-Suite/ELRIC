hi otakon
Baking? Like bread? I LOVE fresh bread.
hi otakon!

Kencolt: same here

Hiiyo otakon

Sumica how about... Cupcakes?
OH MY! WHOOOOOOOOOOO
*vad
Roku!
Sumica: What kind?
*bad
Eddmario: it's the Spirit World
The spirit world is going to freak out when Korra finally gets there
ohm, a measure of resistance
Eddmario WHAT A TWIST!!!!!
Eddmario actually, the movie was based off this
SunderlandPony89: you get Rebellion characters and weapons yet?
ohai otakon
Is this the shadow realm?
run
/me hugs Phase4
hiya Phase4
xmasskills: That'd be pretty badass, actually. But I was thinking trebuchets that fired giant ice rocks xD
/me hugs XAX back
Eddmario no, its the north pole
>.>
otakon: OMG I MISSED YOU!
that too Biglaw
I'm pretty sure this is the shadow realm.
hiya panda
Trippin
Eddmario I'm still wondering how they screwed it up . . . although, they did mess up Battleship, so . . .
otakon: I downloaded the DLC, but I haven't bothered to play ME3 multiplayer yet :P
i love it how the main antagonist becomes a protagonist
I always pictured the shadow realm looking like an old apartment.
:P?
otakon: how you been? seen many ships?
i'm going on a plane today
00,10wheat, white, rasien, buttermilk, potato, redbean, sweet yam
SunderlandPony89: Vorcha characters are DAMN fun to play
Roku's episode is probably one of the best ever =)
panda: no I have not
Here is the part where the Avatar version of Discord comes in
oh god the face stealer episode
Phase4: Where to?
00,10to name a few
the face stealer!
panda is here? I panda :)
no emotion? jedi
MAH FACE
he'll eat ur face
brb in 15 mins lunch time
avatar version of discord is a dick
This is not the face you're looking for
panda: I didnt see you there! howdy!
well i stole your face!
/me 11,01steals faces!
CupcakeWarrior, brisbane, cousin has a wedding so we're all flying up
send Fluttershy after him. She'll give him . . . The Stare
RAWRity: ...still? none? hello? you dead? hes dead. GUYS RAWR IS DEAD.
Red Bean and Yam? Sounds somewhat asian.
/me was being sarcastic
I'm kind of hoping that Amon got the power to energybend from Koh
Sylandest: :D hiya
sounds good Kencolt
FlareChaser: he is not dead
FlareChaser: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nf7O1XAXoup3obyzU8_yHXvFCk841LPCsoxSIAnW9Z0/edit?pli=1

kenne88: DUDE! You NEED TO GET Vorcha!
00,10it's in chinatown
the Snow doesnt give a sh** Zuko
Because I really want Koh to show up again.
nice Flare
Sylandest: yeah actually... relaxing after work... got some tea and im set :D
otakon: why
Sumica: Big Trouble in Little China?
you want no emotion go get bella from twilight...
RAWRity: he more then likely will
RAWRity Lol!
RAWRity: Well, that left me severly depressed...
kenne: ask RX-78-SweetieBot
panda: im the same. I would drink some tea, but then I wouldn't sleep at all
Sumica: I see. well, it's nice you have a job you like-- and is better to boot.
xmasskills Fluttershy will win anyway, admit it. A yellow pony is so much more of a boss
thats...that was:( so deep
00,10good choice for a B movie
Sumica: why you have Luna too?
xmasskills: That'd be a big more advanced then they're capable of. The Fire Nation tropps just walked right into the city without a fight. Kinda not a good stragety
I think I might leave now :|
dat iroh
otakon: god i hate it when people do that, cant you just tell me
Sumica: The Last Airbender Movie? XD
00,10Cause I like luna
FlareChaser: nuuuuu, stay!
kenne: enope
RAWRity I call dibs on Rainbow Dash.
ill brb, gonna get some water
otakon: why the hell not
LOL
It's simply really... we remove the moon
Fail
FIAL
what
and I love that scene
that fail
Fialz
lol
Biglaw: You don't get to decide your ship.
haha best moment ever'\
00,10they never made an airbender movie
admiral choy
fail
Darkts3: That movie made enough to technically be an A movie
Flail.
I decide your ship.
what job would you be able to apply for when you finish?
Definite lack of success.
kenne: bc, RX-78-SweetieBot is more passionate about it.
lol
Sumica:.. oh ya
RAWRity oh dear, I apologize
http://mlfw.info/f/1298/ dat fluttershy
RAWRity: who the fuck said YOU did?
FORESHADOWING
FlareChaser: The mods said I could.
hi
RX-78-SweetieBot: well he doesnt seem to care enough to answer, so why dont you just tell me
Ohai BronysNations
RAWRity: Well, that was a stupid idea and I think they were just being nice.
otakon* woops
o hai BronysNations
hi BronysNations
00,10your ship is......... the HMS pinafore
Naruto =/
this part is down right creepy D:
hi BronysNations
giant wolf
kill the ocean spirit. suddenly no water, boats useless
SunderlandPony89: well they could make it for small cities instead of big ones or atleast military bases that can be moved to attack with stealth
DBZ FTW
FlareChaser: The seemed pretty excited about it. plus I'm also the ordained Twoll of Bronystate
faceless monkey :O:O:O:O
USS JEFF BISCUIT
WHAT
oh sh**
damn
hen3ry they aren't going to kill the ocean . . .
otakon: he doesnt seem to care enough to anwer the pings, so why dont oyu jsut tell me
Well I stole your face
RAWRity he want to be shipped, ship him with the kitchen sink
11,01Guess they don't go back to the spirit world when they die.
BronysNations SAME HERE!
00,10why the long fa......er no face
Here is where I come in
lol
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Now now, we all know the kitchen sink is in love wit emangamer
when will the Bronycon start?
dull
/me 11,01Khos
...
RAWRity oh really ?
LOOK ITS GOHMA
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: The kitchen sink is already shipped with RD
RainBowJack: 10 am on june 30th
jeez I would have lost my face
This guy is nothing like me
RAWRity: I could care less, thats basically cyber bullying though, you say "shipping cheating" but thats just retarded...
dat stache
Dark92Enigma: or Keannu Reaves
xmasskills: Maybe some kind of tunnel system between cities. That'd be pretty useful, actually :p
add me on skype my name is bonnie heuer
Why so SERIOUS?
Nittany_Discord: if you kho'd in reality, I would likely flip out...lol
wonder what was his own face
Try hard me
dat baboon
FlareChaser: and you take shit way too seriously.
:S
Its that monkey from Lion King?
RAWRity actually, he was my second choice LOL
SunderlandPony89: i mean who is going to expect a military base to just pop out of no were and if the water tribe got the city underwater with the fire nation there everyone would die so the water nation has the advantage even if their city was overrun
/me shivers
RAWRity he may just be drunk
otakon: well then i guess im going back to rock band then
kenne: he's built for you, he regens health the more you kill enemies and he has a lunge Power Melee
RAWRity: cause people make me take it too seriously.
i wish i could go to the bronycon
kenne: What system?
Fus Ro yay
CupcakeWarrior: xbox
kenne: him and Krogan Battlemaster you NEED dammit
owl
FlareChaser: how? it's not like people have gone overboard about it to you. otakon at least has grounds to be pissed.
/me 11,01collects
plus zuko shoots fire, so i dont see them freezing to death in the snow
Twi La Sparkle

RAWRity: thank you
He is like a pedophile

kenne: I have it on ps3
Sumica: damn, I never realized that
lamesauce
he really wants to steal his face
brb
Hey! Luna is not named Twi!
xmasskills: Still kinda impossible for that to happen. Way to big to move a base/city underwater
Dat face
WHAT A TWEEST

He showed expersion

0,14Topless: essentially people with lots of super powers
00,10Topless, one with out top. No one is above them in skill
Sumica: still, do they explain how the HELL they can do that? I know it's 12,000 years after the Jupiter sized Black Hole bomb but still....
Nittany_Discord: If you did maid discord it would technically be maid hour
damn Nono is tall

Sumica: God, they even kept the sound clips intermission types
00,10soon™ RainBowJack
panda: ._.
Biglaw: or perhaps mix the powder with butter-- to make a flavored shoco-butter.
lol
Sumica: do Amano and Noriko make an appearance in this one?
00,10it would not be Gainax with out tits
panda yeeaah, ima go throw dis out

11,01Talking cats?
Biglaw: >.> im sorry... just looking out for you :(

00,10the cat is being controlled by another topless
11,02Hai :D
good boi panda
Sumica: could you please not spoil?
/me wants to draw filly SB63
Sumica: makes sense, so the topless are basically people with psychic powers
MahBoi777: well... I know this because I made a similar mistake
00,10it's never explained
00,10yeah otakon
Okay. Sorry.
otakon: Huh, weird.
I'm eating Carrots at 11:00 PM :)
Sumica: makes sense, it HAS been 12,000 years
Annnnnnd. It doesn't work for a computer that's 10 years old. I'm just gonna hold out until this old piece of (squee) dies. :$

Sumica: looks like it
Ingwaz: Where am I going to get worms and plastic minnoes?
!attack BlueFlare McAfee_Antivirus horrible_programming
SaxyPretender: FLCL ofc
McAfee_Antivirus uses horrible_programming on BlueFlare! BlueFlare has 57 HP left!
That probably qualifies as a uchu kaijuu.
0,14yep
Ponies47: sure, if you keep them peeled
Biglaw,one time,I woke up at 3 in the morning.I wanted Icecream so I wne downstairs.I was so tired that I fell asleep in The freezer.

Eh, not as impressive as Gunbuster was if you ask me
hell yes
dAT EXPLOSION
this is like megas xlr
Sumica: you wouldn't happen to have the Angel Densetsu OVAs, would you?
00,10this is just the first ep otakon
theyre destroying everything around them
otakon agree
Sumica: I know, but still where are the beam cannons?
00,10sorry no RAWRity
I see the piloting harness is the same
IKOUSEI!
wtf
otakon: you've gotta build up to em
RAWRity: oh
0,14My robot has an awesome cape, your space monster is invalid
well... topless females always have power over me ^^
Ether? WHEN THE HELL DID ETHER COME INTO THE EQUATION?!
11,01So, are they going to run across the universe and have trouble with time dilation?
SaxyPretender: lol
true that
The staple of a good action series is that you don't blow your load all at once. You've gotta have BUILDING action.
capes win wars
RAWRity: XD
yup MahBoi777
Holy garbage that space bug is getting the guts punched out of him!
00,10not me panda, at least not the moe ones
RAWRity: :D
Sumica: God, the first series was practically hard sci fi, bu this seems so.....cliche in comparison
geeky-brony: it's been proven lol
IMO, it wouldn't belong in the Gunbuster universe if time dilation weren't still an issue.
yes it has MahBoi777 yes it has
00,10yeah they tossed the hard scifi out the window
Sumica: like that Space Monster
and panty shot
PANTIE SHOT!!!
dat maid outfit
dat panty shot
00,10and time dialation never comes in to play as they never leave sol
JUST SPLIT IT!
RainBowJack: lol
/me faps to the panty shot
o_o
I liek panty shots
ohh nothing to see here... o_o
0,14calm down there
Its guna split in half huh
Gunthler: stop that
SPAAACCCEEE!!!
O_O
11,01Gotta like maids.
It's like how when you're makign sweet sweet love to somebody you love. You don't just pound your pelvises together for 30 minutes. YOu start slow, then gradually raise the pace, throw em for a flew loops on what you're gonna do, and then all of a sudden, they're not sure when it happened, but you're giving them the best sex of their life.
....
well isnt that "unexpted
0,14...
Oh my
That's what action is supposed to be like.
...
it just lifted it's leg
LULZ
what a tweest
and THEY'RE OFF!
RAWRity: I know what you mean....
We're blasting off again!
wheeeeeeeeeeee
Everlasting_Joy: lolz
uhh houston we have lift offf
Okay, well Nono is toast
SPAAAAAAACE
spaaaaace
11,01A bug that stages.
yeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
Sumica: wow, new record for Gainax, killing off the heroine in the first 15 minutes
That's why the Transformers movies are such messes. They just THROW action at the screen without any buildup or tension, until eventually all the spectacle just stops really meaning anything to you.
Gator?
BUSTAH GATOR
Nah
Master Gator? i c wut u did der
so why is she cring
pew
Bustah Wolf is still better
02nuuuu
02D:
geeky-brony: killed the girl
00,10cause nono is dead
ok
So, Nono's two special abilities are splitting things in half and breathing in space?
I don't hink that means what they think it means.
or........she was..........
and super strength
THE HELL DID SHE SURVIVE THAT?!
otakon: That's nothing. Excel Saga killed off the heroine in the first fifteen SECONDS-- and three or four more times in the first episode.
and speaking in a vacuum
omfg
BOOBS
seriously
Sumica: dat animation
TOPLESS!
/me tries to get away from it
BOOOBBBBBSSS!!!!
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOB
twilight_sprinkler: IT IS SYMBOLIC DAMMIT!
0,14ass kicking time
/me faps tothe boobs

Now it makes sense.
thats BULLSHIT
0,14INAZUMA KIIIIIIIIIIIIICK
INAZUMA KICK!
otakon: yeah sure.
I hear oxygen is abundant in space around this time of year.
/me 11,01slaps Gunthler
...
Kencolt: Well to be fair, Excel Saga wasn't a show so much as it was an attempt to give TV cencors aneurisms.
That's NOT what Topless means... Oh, why bother.
twilight_sprinkler: you didn't watch Gunbuster did you?
Hello Everypony!
otakon: nope.
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMM
Howdy Storm_Chaser.
twilight_sprinkler: and THAT is why you don't get that bit
11,01Hi Storm_Chaser
/me glomps Storm_Chaser
....
well, she is topless
Starlight BREAKEEEERRRR
00,10even the landing on the palm there was a bit from gunbuster
otakon: yeah, sure.
MahBoi777: PONIES!!! ;3
hey Storm_Chaser
O_O
anime....geez
0,14yep
twilight_sprinkler: well, it's two fold
indeed she became TOPLESS
wait
was she
What is that girl? Well, she is topless.
TOPLESS?
/me is glomped and nuzzles MahBoi777 "Hey~"
o__o
I was mildly optimistic that Gainax wouldn't make the "topless" thing literal.
that kind of joke
Sumica: explain to twilight_sprinkler the significance of that scene please
/me hugs MahBoi777
I need to hit the hay folks.
/me liked dem bewbs. o_o
Hey Nittany_Discord and Everlasting_Joy how are you?
Gainax has 3 staples: Robots, explosions, Bewbies
Kandarihu: they did, it's alos a throw back to the first series
00,10it was a throwback from gunbuster
how the heck is she still breathing
gnigth Everlasting_Joy! sleep well
Sumica: um, you dont have to. i was leaving anyway
night Everlasting_Joy sleep well
00,10four RAWRity, you forgot vespas
night Everlasting_Joy
/me hugs RainBowJack back
11,01Night Everlasting_Joy
Sumica: they love their scooters don't they?
okay, so the "Topless" are members of something called a "Fraternity"
Sumica: those aren't quite as prevalent.
So they kept in the parts that held it back, and threw out what made it great.
lol toplicious
toplicious: Whoo?
lolz
dat plot
oohh THAT plot
DAT NEKKID LADY
yeeep, definitely not fanservice
lol
11,01I don't even think the original had fan service.
/me is getting way too excited over this...
I liek nekkid ladies
and THAT PREVIEW MUSIC!
oh myyyyyy
Gainax's other Calling card is fantastic animation quickly followed by rushed, poorly budgeted animation.
CupcakeWarrior: who doesn't?
As far as I'm concerned, the hard scifi is my kind of fanservice. The nipples are nothing but annoyances.
RAWRity: yeah, that's true too.
Kandarihu: but there is no hard scifi here
otakon: Of course, I still like flat chests better
scifi with hard nipples
lul
Kandarihu: i sorta agrre with you
0,14>Take On Me
time to brush my teethies
Kandarihu: well, Gunbuster was surprsingly hard scifi for being Gainax
0,14YESYESYESYES
Just yes.
Because throughout all their years, Gainax still hasn't figured out hwo to properly budget their series.
oh god this video
I love this PMV and song
This song. Haha.
best song ever from my childhood
0,14best 80s song
This makes so much sense since I saw the origonal music video
Hard... nipply... scifi. OK. new term for us all to remember.
SaxyPretender: I like "The Sun Always Shines on TV" better, personally.
lol dis song
RAWRity: lol, blow everything on the first ep huh?
AHA TAKE ME ON!!!
00,10gunbuster was also extreamly early gainax
Kencolt: I DID NOT MEAN IT LIKE THAT
otakon: sort of, yeah.
otakon: Suuuure you didn't.
HAX
Taaaaaaaake ooon meeeeeeeee
0,14...no way
the magic pencil!
I'll beeeeeee goooooooone
Sumica: I swear the character designer that worked on Gunbuster did Project A-Ko too, the character designs are just too damn similar
lol
I WANT TWI'S PENCIL!
otakon: only time it didn't really happen was FLCL because it was so short, and Gurren Lagann because they threw ALL THE MONEY at that project.
00,10would not supprise me otakon
0,14if you guys could see my face right now
Q-ko and FLCL are the same author for the mangas
SaxyPretender: Take pics
Sumica: given the time frame it probably did
00,10i take it you like this one SaxyPretender
0,14yeeeep
owlicious: Who?
/me 11,01takes on
this PMV is very well made
/me takes off Nittany_Discord
i'll take you on, Nittany_Discord !
I laughed a good deal when I saw this yesterday
And stuff like that is why I laugh when people praise Gainax, or say they're the "best anime studio" out there.
/me dances
lol
oops, misread that
00,10editing goes along way to makeing a good pmv a great one
Because damn if that isn't patently untrue.
owlicious: Who? :D

space snow is best snow

the physics of this world were written by Pinkie. It's the only reasonable explanation. (but someponyelse had to make the violence and stuff)
yes MahBoi777 yes it is
Santa saved teh day
well it could be from an comet? those are the ones made from ice correct?
MahBoi777: NO
comets are best snowcone
yes king
^=^
hen3ry: And you can say that after seeing Gurren Lagaan and FLCL? This makes PERFECT sense in comparision.
tay are
Actually I don't think I saw any GL. FLCL isn't meant to make sense, I don't even TRY to analyze that.
lol
I dunno, physics is our rules. I think you would need a new word for theirs.
Kencolt: nope FLCL mackes mor sence
well then maybe two comets collided :D
cheesecake
that seems possible
King: yus that will work i think
hen3ry: Never seen... You poor poor deprived soul. I weep for you.
needs moar bewbs
FLCL is internally consistent. We went from Gunbusters and its strict adherance to time dialation, to Diebusters with Magical Girl Robots with Snowcones

AHHHHHHHH YOU SON OF A MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!!!!!!! I WILL CRUCIFY YOUR FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!! DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
here's my voice http://vocaroo.com/i/s0ZbeiU1cAkC
These games never heard of "War Prisoners"?
whoa calm down Kipkat07_USAF
13hey look, it's the modern warfare guys!
:O language
pew pew time?

13the player was useful!
MahBoi777: Dont tell me what to do you commie son of a bitch

:/
Shizuka: all soldiers look alike in these games, don't they? :D
SuperBrony64: Are you playing on veteran difficulty??
SuperBrony64: save private ryan
mario_pony: it sounds so beautiful!
Kipkat07_USAF: 0_o
13at least price and gaz had a relationship you could sense
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
back
Shizuka: Never played any of the CoD games. It just felt like Medal of Honour all over again. D:
11,02HEART ATTACK
Wow, haven't seen gameplay from this in a year or 2 now.
hey, Pinkies4thWall you're on borderlands right now, right
13so many of these "you are part of a squad" games do nothing to suggest the characters have spent more than five seconds with each other
this one is world at war ?
cowvarkian: yes
mmk
Shizuka: Take a look at Bad COmpany. XD
i dunno
SuperBrony64: Mission failed. protect Ryan failed. Restart from checkpoint
the original Modern Warfare is the only CoD I'd be willing to play
I wish someone would make an exceptional World War 2 game.
(unless my brother wants me to play multiplayer against him or zombies with him)
13see from what i can tell, right around modern warfare 1 was the last time any of these realistic shooters tried to give the player freedom
cowvarkian: y?
just wondering
13they turned into marginally interactive movies from there
SuperBrony64: Pick up a M1 Garand ASAP
^
World at War: Minecraft Edition
Vordox,I tried once more! :$ It still might be crappy,but an inprovement :) http://vocaroo.com/i/s0gWlXVJuGsa

BONZAI!
cowvarkian: what's your tag?
All of these new FPS games resemble Halo so much its ridiculous
Gamer_Luna: All I hear is a "huuuuh"
WTF was that Gamer_Luna?
Pinkies4thWall: you're on my friends list >.>
GOODNEESSS!
Stormman3100: All of these games resembles Duke NUkem 3D to me. XD
my joker imprshin http://vocaroo.com/i/s0lsxSp4KMTY it might suck
RvB Red Dude
http://i.imgur.com/tA6Ia.png and this everyone, is why Rarity is best pony
STUPID COMPUTER!
WHOO WHOO! :P
Halo was such a boring series imo
geeky-brony: depends on which joker you're impersonating
13duke 3d at least takes you to interesting locations
I love halo
13like a prison or the post office
as well as Luna...and Mrs. Cake....and Granny Smith oh and Derpy too
geeky-brony: :O
Yep, nto to mention, ROCKET PACK made it more awesome. :D
Eddmario,yes,that was me.I suck at singing -_-
lol
i prefer Goldeneye 64
your voice is beautiful
Nothing beats DOOM
Has never play Halo. :$ Please don't be mad at me :(
13and yeah it's duke so you go to strip clubs and such but there's still detail in that that makes it more interesting
*played
Gamer_Luna: Yeah, what mario_pony said
Ponies47: We won't. it's an Xbox exclusive
Ponies47: I'm so mad! lol jk
/me 13likes her some duke 3d once a year or two
CrimsonPheonix Correction: That proves that Luna is best pony
Ponies47: It isnt worth the try. Its just bad lol
I feel so warm inside :)
OH SHIT
Shizuka: You actually completed the game O.o
thx ad
blocking view
The first Halo was great
DIE TOJO!!!!!
Lets watch sum Duke Nukem Forever
13doom tried to do interesting locations but was more about just mowing down the demons
The second one had a great multiplayer
Gamer_Luna: That is the power of BronyState. :3
/me likes halo, but is a fanboy, so dont take his opinion for it
Vordox: I have a PS3. Well it's my brothers. I really don't like video games :$
get adblocker plus and noscript dentidiot
/me gets over excietd and way to into war games
it degrade considerably from 3
13the community chest wads are great for doom 2 though, extremely high detail
God I hate my voice :|
Shizuka: You got to admit, for leveldesignen, they are revolutionary on that. Atleas trying to give the enviroment identity.
it sounds so mexican
a mix with Heath Ledger and mark hemaln
Shizuka: a girl playing FPSes? More likely than you think. :)
13silly madsurge you have not seen my playtime on l4d1 and 2 :3
I wanna see one of you guys do a stream of you trying out Steambot Chronicles for the PS2
mario_pony: youre voice doesnt sound like you smoke tho :P
mario_pony: lol don hate ur voice
i wish i could get rid of my srupid accent
*stupid
Skyidle / Skylands also likes wubstep, so you can be wubstep buddies with her (when she's on)
13it's good for spatial reasoning and of course hand eye coordination
Shizuka: I don't have neither :D but I love Doom
mario_pony: wat accent?

11,02Shizuka: :3
Eddmario: Get a better quiet room that doesn't have sound bounce.

Gamer_Luna: But you know how to vibrato,that's a rare talent in singers.
shizuka aposed to a kinect xD
oh no! they forgot to pack nachos!
13well kinect would be a rail shooter, which probably isn't far from what cod would rather be..
Gamer_Luna: Also, I did hear your breathe, when talking to the mic, you can have it sideways while you sing, it'll take out the puffs of sir, and make it sound better.

Shizuka: One of the few consoles I own, and I sold it back to the vendor cause the library sucked. :P
Shizuka: yep
13you pay through the nose to get community service on xbox, what excuse is there for advertisements?
Darkts3: really :3 have you finished it ?
I don't like Xbox. They get the red ring of death to much :$
mario_pony: postiv
360 did went to complete shit on the third update
Raigon: nope
13course the same could be said for cable
Ponies47: lol that was 5 years ago
hey everypony sup?
Darkts3: Oh :C
13that's the other problem, consoles are so far behind PCs in terms of power, it's holding graphics back
hey Sketch_Toku_Brony
that's why i have a PS3
Darkts3: O THEY FIXED DAT?!? :O
/me takes of mask and satb mario_pony ... i rilly never was on your side
^
Shizuka: We don't needd more graphics imo
Shizuka: GET OUT OF MY HEAD!!!!!!!!!! STOP STEALING MY THOUGHTS!!!!!!!!

The consoles have their advantages
PC>>Console
04There's just no way

Ghosties: You're missing out on all the Elite bosses klls D:

SuperBrony64: got Gears of War 3 by any chance?
Mario 3 is full of demonic posessions
04Perhaps :P

That's probably the reason it's addicting as hell

You're still a good singer, ScootaChicken.

04Don't use that stupid "SWAG" bullshit
Ninjazz: ikr

lolz
Ghosties: why the bloody hell you so awesome
04It's...*sighs* it's a really stupid saying
they are, but they don't know it hurts because they're not being cut themselves
also, scissors cost munny to replace
04It's the most tryharding of tryharding lately
ohh ok

Su-wag.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I know that feel bro
Yar/
also, they'll find it slighly rude if i tell them, mb
swag is for boys class is for men
02over $9000
/me coughs
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/swag
Where did I get that b= from?
>.> twasnt me
I'm sorry, Ghosties.
04I have a better definition for "swag"
go ahead
11,02-.-
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Y U N O sleep?
'Swag, originally Australian slang for stolen goods'
swag used to be free stuff you got at events and get togethers I thought
04A stupid saying that's overused. People 90 per cent are dumb teenagers, 10 per cent are little ass kids trying to be cool use it for EVERYTHING and also as their facebook name thinking that shit's cute
'Swag, promotional items given away at trade fairs and events'
probably wasnt originally that ScootaChicken...
ScootaChicken: tis tru
swag= stupid white ass gangwanbe
'Swag (album), a 2002 album by former Guns N' Roses guitarist, Gilby Clarke'
Ghosties: yeah I gotta agree :)
I own that album.
It sucks.
I first heard it from that Remix of Solja Boi's songs. I just thought that it was funny.
02brb
02foods
I always think of the word literally...
02ლ(´ڡ`ლ)
so yeah
04I'm more hipster than hipsters, I swear
04I hate hipsters
Guns N Roses have the right to say that
12IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND
hey...
04I hate everything, so I must be the ULTIMATE HIPSTER
12god I used to say that all the time
04Actually, that's not true
04I <3 Katamari
/me hums theme
geeky-brony: and others read the 3rd paragraph http://vampgyrl420.hubpages.com/hub/The-True-Meaning-Behind-Wearing-Your-Pants-on-the-Ground
12I didnt even know what it meant
hipster's just didi it before it was mainstream
di di di di di di digimon
Ghosties: That's only because katamari is bucking spic
04What does it make you if you think everything is dumb and stupid?
Ghosties likes Neitzche, so he can't be hipster. Neitzche is too mainstream.
A dumbass, Ghosties
I still need to figure out what hipster is.
04Hah, "dumbass"
emo?
thanks Gamer_Luna
04I see what you did there
Ghosties: You?
Welcome
:3
methinks I spelt something wrong

>.<

Ninjazz: alot *troll face*
I already saw,I like it :) and no,his not,but I like him A LOT :)
Not even my informants have been telling me good enough information.
Ninjazz: Indeed. Alot.
the world ended and ponies took over
it started in florida
cowvarkian: in south beach
Well... Can anyone care to tell me?
well, despite false information, there are zombies in florida
Congrats.
welll Ninjazz theres a zombie in south beach
Gamer_Luna: well ok then your set on my request list =3
Airpuff: We all are.
Ninjazz: Ahahaha
In Miami isnt it Alicorn_Prince_Shane
cowvarkian: flesh eating zombies
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Not surprised... Not clean down there.
When will it be done?
cowvarkian: south beach
I dont know the difference
cowvarkian: that was really fucked tho
VioletGreySha: I'm thinking about sending in a request for me being a pony. I'm not sure about allt the details I would like. I would have to think about it.
Gamer_Luna: no idear i still got 4 other artwork todoo
Well, there might be a zombie in both places, I got conflicting reports
cowvarkian: he took 4 shots and just growled at the cops wit flesh in his mouth
I heard it was 9
or 6
Oh,well.Can't wait :)
Ponies47: u iz will be a filly k
http://youtu.be/Ef-C6cb0A0M
From what I have been hearing though... Things sound as if they have gotten abit rough around here.
cowvarkian: more than one shot lol
But I did hear that same story Alicorn_Prince_Shane
Ninjazz: havent they always
Ponies47: just think and make a request then iam here everyday sow :)
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Not from what I've been told.
Ninjazz: Yeah, they have.
Ninjazz: yesh
Well, everyone should head towards low population centers, and start preparing for the worst
TheRainbowDash: Care to elaborate?... :S
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: FILLY?!? :O I'm A dude! So I would rather be a colt. :)
Though, maybe not just yet...
Ninjazz: The chat has gotten a little more tense with the mods, and the RP issue is getting more heated.
Wait, Im not RPing
Ponies47: ur still cute tho lawl
Ahhh. I have heard that.
Sounds bad,
TheRainbowDash: more heated? Its boiling xD
TheRainbowDash: yea and alot of AoP
Airpuff: Eh, whatever you want to call t nowadays.
/me is serious about the whole zombie thing
TheRainbowDash: :P

Ninjazz: Yeah. They've hit down ont it quite hard.
Well... Shit.
Airpuff: And I am one of those affected.;_;
Ponies47: wub heart with wings
TheRainbowDash: -.- me a bit too
Airpuff: even tho the rule says EXCESSIVE
But, I think that even though we arent exactly RPing, we shouldnt continue on this zombie conversation >.>
TheRainbowDash: How many strikes you got now? :S
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Yeah..
Ninjazz: So far, 0.
Ponies47: just let you time to think you dont need to decide now ^^

Ninjazz: yeah.. xD

Airpuff: well he accidently offended dari and dari threatened to ban him if ScootaChicken didnt sing winter wrap up
ScootaChicken: Shane likes to talk about you.
ScootaChicken: Abuse of Power
Ninjazz: that's creepy
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ..lolwat?
ScootaChicken: Indeed.
Airpuff: i kr

TheRainbowDash: Y U NO NOTICE ME? ;_;
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: like seriously? :s
Ninjazz: Yeah, very good times. I remember back to the days of when I just came in here. Man, how they lasted and then faded away like the orange sunset, disappaearing into the night, so only that the start can take over our visions.
Fuck it, this bus ride will take a while
CrazyCherry: I notice you...:D
ScootaChicken: thats what happened right?
*stars
lol TheRainbowDash .. that descibtion... xD
And then ScootaChicken sang, because he's my bitch.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Essentially.

/me hugs TheRainbowDash.
prince-lemon: Your botom bitch?:D
Dang. It's almost 5:30 AM and I'm still wide awake. Guess I shouldn't of drank so much soda :$
04Oh god, get a fucking room you two
TheRainbowDash: What's hillarious is that all this "shit" started when I lost my internet for a while... What a world.

prince-lemon: And why are you called Prince Lemon? Lemons aren't that good anyway.:\
Ponies47: Lies!! Soda is good for you!
CrazyCherry: Don't let dari stream
silly Ponies47
TheRainbowDash: Yes... It. Was. Torture. I only had the ability to use a simple office computer to get somethings off the internet (IE : Fics, songs, pictures) and sometimes visit BronyState for only 5 hours at a time during the VERY early mornings.
Might do
Might stream some lemons.
ScootaChicken: Why?
:>
o.o
prince-lemon: If you stream that video I'll love you forever.
Airpuff: True true. I drank almost 2 liters! :P
If prince-lemon gives you lemons...
Ponies47: That is a puny amout! Drink moar!
Ninjazz: Ah, torture indeed. What morsal soul can survive without the freedom of thy internet these timeful days?
VioletGreySha ,Like my Fanic? :)
Ponies47: u drank 2 litres of soda UR GONNA HAVE A BAD DAY
I'm not noticed in this chat!
prince-lemon: Don't, becuase it is a waste of streaming.
TheRainbowDash: I barely didn't... Bored out of my FREAKIN mind everyday.
Gamer_Luna: didnt read it and not the time for me right now ^^
Ninjazz: Ah, the old boredness syndrome. That sucks.:D
/me notices CrazyCherry
Okay,sorry :'(
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ALMOST 2 liters the bottle was 2/3 of the way full :$
Indeed.
Oh hi CrazyCherry ... wait-- where are you?

Airpuff: hmmmm
Gamer_Luna: sorry ^^ i want to game a bit for relaxing :3
He must've left.
Ponies47: cough cavites
Airpuff: Fuku you!!!!
CrazyCherry: :P Just kidding, Hows your day?
Now look at the fruits of my labor. Increased vacobulary and an increased awareness of chat rumors and politics. I almost feel like a spy from the amount of information I've been handed by third party ponies.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: It was diet :$
Airpuff: Normal thanks for asking.
Gamer_Luna: pfft drunk 2 litres of ice break extra shot falling asleep
CrazyCherry: Normal?
Ninjazz: Oh, I forgot to write a new chapter yesterday, fuck! My family kept on borrowing my computer, and I got a new game on steam, called Dungeon Defenders, sent as a gift by LightTrooper105 himself.

Ninjazz: hehe, well, excitement can tire one out. I'm glad you're router is fixed though. I was worried I wouldn't get to see anypony before I went to work
Usually he's an asshole, either for a reason, or becuase you're an asshole.
Sylandest: Nah just a normal day!
dats why dont mess up with this guy
but Lightman being a asshole makes him so DAMN AWESOME.
I liek orange slushie...
CrazyCherry: well, if that's normal, thats good by me :) hehe
Sylandest: You know damn well that seeing me is part of your daily routine. :D
Ninjazz: precisely! :D Thus why I wanted to make sure I came on before work, lol
Sylandest: That's just a way I say hi to my more special friends! :|
Sylandest: last night, you wanted to know if I would be on today. Why?
CrazyCherry1: Am I a more special friend? :$
GOOD ENOUGH
Or that's just CrazyCherry being crazy. :$
Sylandest: Yes you are.
WallDives: I had meant to ask if you would tell Nin I had work in case I didnt make it on today. but Nin is here, so its all good :)
Ninjazz: Nah.

12aw D:
YAAAAAAAA
for a children show it's perfect for me
Monfang: you get used to it eventually, and some time later you WILL like it :D
LOL
I don't know what the big deal is, I like the damn intro.
I was listening to it from when the show started. Still not used to it
Knickers not- aw forget it.
Get's you excited for all sorts of adventures and stuff.
Monfang: then you are more resistant the the rest. But you WILL convert ;)
Giger4444: Don't be speaking like that...
Or maybe I know good intros?
Doctor Whooves hates Apples
like what?
Im just joking
This guy sounds like Spy
/me shrugpony
12o-o
ok I guess it's true the Foster's home for imaginary friends had a better intro
I usually skip the intro of every show I watch, so...
This guy is right
/me sprawls
02Hey LL :D
Um, never? Litwick
Litwick, we already are
Litwick: The day when they will need it the most.

No people, dont start this topic, it will turn into a flame war.

Oh btw, they did a check to see how bad it would be if all the ice in the world melted. Honestly. NOt that bad.
But enough of that.
Cya RainBowJack!
Wait they made a black hole machine?
For SCIENCE
Move a mile or two inland and you are at the new shore.
It's not a black hole machine.
^This
Monfang: a few miles might be a great deal in places like New York
it can happend
^
What people were implying could happen wasn't going to
Because Switzerland has chocolate
Night all!
Goodnight Twi_Fi
Gnight Twi_Fi! Take care!
Night Twi_Fi
afternoon
Ever go through Spegettification prince-lemon?
:D
This chat is a gohst-town
WEll even if that's so, Giger. The advance of the water would be so gradual that people would have to be foolish not to get out of the way. and humans are so adaptive that we would move UP more than we would move inland.
Dat funky-shit
ponies!
I am laughing to hard to type
ponies?
Dat Funky shit.
:o
Monfang: it wouldnt be the end of the world thats sure. It would just require a shit ton of money.
OH GOD
lol
I doubt that. It would take a ton of 'get up off your butt and adapt'.
/me noms on Ninjazz's ear.
o_O
Like in Manhatten, it's mostly tall buildings, right?
12Shiny~~~~
I thought you disappeared...
/me hugs CrazyCherry
/me nuzzles CrazyCherry
so
rawrcakes
hi
12how yous been?
Monfang: it would still require tremendous infrastrucutral reallocation/rebuilding etc, and thats a lot of money.
Now, stop nomming ears.
Dat engrish
higs?
/me hugs Ninjazz back syill nomming on his ear.

If the government did it, Giger. But individuals can do exactly what is needed with less money.
Awwww
Ninjazz: Nope.avi!
02I've been alright

Best line ever
It's bad for to drink at this time
02I keep staying up late with Ran though XD
I can think of things right now.
:D
02So I'm tired
Monfang: individuals bringing the electric cables of New York form under the ground for example? I doubt it.
Need some rope, wood and generators.
/me imagives CrazyCherry doing a nope.avi while still trying to nom his ear and hug him at the same time
The electric cables would be in the buildings.
He skipped 8
Imagives... Where did I come up with that one?
Heych

Frankie makes darker jokes
lol i love the gay joke
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/20559/alicorn-blank_flank-book-candle-crown-dialogue-duo
lol
Ooohh
That was more like it
Monfang: of course, but the cables below ground wasnt desinged to withstand a flood so they will be faulty eventually. So they would be needed to be brought to the surface and thats no easy job.
Oh shit...
Ninjazz: I wondered. but she wants you, so...good luck.
:D
WallDives: Yeah... Lots of ponies been wanting me lately... :$
Again, we don't need the cables immediately.
Ninjazz: lol for you having a shipping value >0.

WallDives: Ikr...

IshPonyPonyThePony: It does sound familier... :S
Ninjazz: yeah, they needed more healthy food in the cafeterias..

Welcome back, WallDives.
wb WallDives
hay Gamer_Luna
more to the point, what's your favourite pony type?
aka, earth pony, pegasus or unicorn?
Unicorns control the world. Fact.
Pegasus control weather. Fact.
Earth ponies...
I dunno.
the food
:3
Pegasus ALL THE WAY!
Ninjazz: Controll the food xD
Airpuff: They make food. :S
for me, earth pony=strength, pegasus = agility, unicorn= wisdom, im not an athletic guy so i prefer unicorn
I officially has a new major. YAY.
:)
Ninjazz: .. pretty much.. :s
On what, WallDives?
Ninjazz, school.
hard work and dedication, that's what drives the earth ponies, earth pony for major
(oh wait^^)
WallDives: I know that, I meant what is your new major.
Pegasus because flying seems awesome :)
Sport Leadership and Management.
Nice.
Gamer_Luna: .. but unicorn's can levitate themselves o.o
Unicorns cause i love casting spells
Gamer_Luna: and conjure wings
magic is cheating
/me teleports around da room
only lightweights can levitate themselves
to my theory
With a horn,but I don't want a horn.I don't like horns for some reason.
valoreins: ..how do you explain twilight making a bubble and levitating all the manes at discord arc then? o.o
pipsqueakthepirate: magic is friendship...:D
because her talent is magic?
Airpuff: Magic?
Gamer_Luna: u lesbian :D
Magical_pablez94: wrong, friendship is magic
not all unicorns are master of all magic
NO
WallDives: i know, but he said only lightweights could do it
pipsqueakthepirate: no, Fighting is Magic.
Ninjazz: http://pastebin.com/RwYaxdut
WallDives: ugh, fighting, friendship, but mostly fighting, is magic
dont get picky with me!
BACON IS MAGIC
friendship is gic
pipsqueakthepirate: (its a game.)
Oh. Thanks ehm!
WallDives: (didnt catch that, duh)
Funny you remembered about that. :$
pipsqueakthepirate: if X=Y then Y=X... if friendship=magic then magic=friendship.
Magical_pablez94: this tree is made of wood
are all things made of wood now trees?
if all friendship is magic, that doesn't mean all magic is friendship
pipsqueakthepirate: actually they are. no more alive but they are. ur argument is invalid.
Airpuff: do ctrl+f on that link
It's actually rather hard to read, ehm. :$
What time is it over there?It's 11:00 AM here :)

/me glomps SuperBrony64
Magical_pablez94: aren't bushes made of wood? plants?
Gamer_Luna: like no one never was ~
though to be fair, that wasn't the best of examples
Pokemon Conquest comes out later this month.
Hai SuperBrony64 :P
To catch them is my real test
pipsqueakthepirate: pipsqueakthepirate: btw it was a joke, man.
no, jokes are not allowed here
shame on you!
Gamer_Luna: to train them is my cause!!! ~
I will traval across the land!
god I love this song
pipsqueakthepirate : what do you mean no jokes
searhing far and wide
Gamer_Luna: searching far and wide ~
Rikku379: jokes are only for the older ponies
POKEMON
I feel like a freak. I never watched the Pokemon series and I never played any game (video or cardgame) related to it.
ohai Shineh~
Gamer_Luna: the pok[mon to understand
i've played too much and seen to much pokemon
It seems everyone else did.
realised fast it's all the same, all the same
è*
POKEMON
Giger4444: I havenseen the anime, if it makes you feel betetr.
just the promo tape from NP.
Gamer_Luna: u missed a line:D
Pokemon red, blue and yellow were the best
to be fair
Who's streaming?
WallDives: but you played the game I presume? :)
I don't lnow the whole song :$
I am
pipsqueakthepirate: to each, their own opinion.

Giger4444: I have, and read the manga.
prince-lemon: Can you watch some standup from Dane cook afterwards? The sneezing atheist? x
WallDives: See? Im a freak! :D
/me hugs VioletGreySha back :3
WallDives: I'm not saying the rest are bad, oh no, I've played plenty of silver, gold, and some older ones.... but they're just all so alike. THey really improved so little on it
I mean, RBY competitively is a notorious crapshoot.
/me sings for Gamer_Luna "i wanna be the very best like no one never was... to catch them is my real testto train them is my cause!"
pipsqueakthepirate: after gen 3, there isnt much TO improve on, outside of newer/better movesets.
/me "i'll travell across the land seacrhing far and wide... teh pokèmon to understand the power that's inside!"
but Gen 5's story is actually pretty good, for pokemon.
imo.
11,02Magical_pablez94: Kony's theme song?
SuperBrony64: kony's?
Dane cook? :'( Pliis
Aw..
Huggles Magical_pablez94 :)

I'm squemish as hell when it comes around to blood.
WallDives: that sucks. I should go and see if I can.

Bleed
I can handle gore but when you start getting needles out and stuff, I just feel like i'm about to faint.
so... vampires should eat more oranges...
It's the opposite for me Ninjazz, needles only mildly concern me but any realistic/real gore makes me yelp like a kid :(
lol
I'm a violence/gore artis. :)
MadSurge: If you play the stuff I've played, you just get desensitized.
ARTIST
But needles... *shudders*
ohai Om.
Ninjazz: I can play/see any fake gore, but real blood... *shudders*

SuperBrony64: i buyed it... like 2 hours after it was available just the time to run to the nearest GameStop and get some microsoft ponits..:D
no
how
did you
why didn't they keep this anouncer for the second game

WHY
Pony boy is a pretty lame insult to be honest.
Not hell ddifficulty? XD
you're the only one who says ra :P
she still thinks i shouldent watch it and every time i say males watch it... she says she doesnt belive me
alexxm: What is the first game, Continuum Shift or Calamity Trigger?
CT Calamity Trigger
Neo-Changling-Ridley: Then she is OBVIOSLY wrong.

I told her about this place and apperently she thinks all of you are girls
calamity triger Malavolent
Oh, thanks.
Cya valoreins! Take care.
bye valoreins
By the way, is Valkenhayn playable in CT?
Apperently its ok for girls to watch crap like power rangers but when a boy watches my little pony its so wrong
nyaaan
no Malavoen you need DLC i think
LAWL
I know
no Malavoent you need DLC i think
Neo-Changling-Ridley: I can not contain my facehoofs at that statement.
Yea my sister is a idiot
alexxm: Aww, too bad.
Indeed.
Girls play sports and video games with no one caring.
ooh blazblue
and yet she has pony toys from the old gens
FINISH HIM
alexxm: But Hazama is unlockable, isn't he?
MadSurge: Buy Extend, you get all characaters and updated playgames, Malavolent

no Malavolent not as far as i know
Damn.
she even mocked me giving one to me saying ehres a new toy to play with
And guys get called "gay" when they do girly things
I hate her so much
I hate that SO much
Neo-Changling-Ridley: Who is the elder? You or her?
Me
i'm i think 16 she's 12
Anyone here plays Rachel?
Gamer_Luna: that's quite unfair...
i play noel
Malavolent: You have Extend? =3
i tend to stick as bang Malavolent
Neo-Changling-Ridley: She is clearly ignorant.
Vordox: Unfortunately, not. :(
In the most formal sense of the word.
Yea she is quite the ignorant bitch
she thinks she can do what ever she wants
I prefer Ragna as I sympatize with him.
But I want to learn Rachel.
Sounds like a regular "princess" to me.
What would you know about princess's
Well lets see..i have a list of things she's done
Magical_pablez94 ,I know.I hate that that's so unfair.I disagree what that,it's horriable
she's carved holes in the walls
UGH, this juice sucks balls.
she's cut up bed sheets
Om: I have a cousin that thinks she can do what ever he heart desires and get who ever she wants to do something... somethinh she wants.
her*
Gamer_Luna: mah... damned society... the only thing to do is IGNORE. and that's what i actually do.
02ra
Ninjazz: Gotta love these people.
and she painted her furnature
Those are the funnest ones to mess with.
Malavolent: I do love these people/ponies.
Om: Aye. But then she cries to my mother and then everything becomes un worth it.
-_-
Also you know what sucks Ninjazz ?
Magical_pablez94 ,Love and tolerance by fellow pony :)
Hmmm?
MY*
She has lied so damn much that when something happens and i have nothing to do with it my parents dont believe me
Gamer_Luna: exactly

/me sighs
I still think my mom wasted 240 dollars giving her a 3ds
/me is glas he has no sister or cousin.

Malavolent: y?

They harden up after a few seconds after blowing.
Make a dick joke and I stab you.

Litwick: That's what she said.
It would be hard to come up with one so quickly
Remix 8 afterwards SuperBrony64?

/me watches a tumble weed roll across the chat
/me catches the tumbleweed in a bug net
