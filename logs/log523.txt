you don't have to find the moon...
00,10yeah you need to use that rotate parts thing I was talking about.
umm

Suddenly Fluttershy -lol
lol tough shit :D

duh
Moar Kerbal?
Hi:
:)
Iron_Edge: fluttershy can be heard anywhere...even in the vacuum of space
Sylandest: seems Legit.
Ohai ACS13123! Yes more Kerbel :P
hey ACS
hmm slowly decending?
03!pint
Iron_Edge: my answer to that is this: ponies. that is all
03!ping
!pong
also protip... you can pilot from map mode, by activating the navball.
00,10retro grade should put you in to orbit
Lets do the time warp again....
that's prograde...
03woah what, Sony cameras that use SD cards?
Sylandest: Wise response as expected -lol
00,10Some day I should stop screwing around in this game and truly land on the sun.
The silence in space makes it more errie
you can't land on the sun. Remember?
13not_doppler: You are lying, and are attempting to access this network with multiple clients from the same connection.
did I miss any movies and such?
Cant land on Sun.... Challenge Accepted!
Sumica: The sun is hot, have fun
00,10joystick is hax
13I would strongly advise you shape up.
I was hoping to catch a Bebop episode again
Sumica: But sumica...wont you like ya' know.....Sun-xplode???
not_doppler..avoid makin shizu mad...you'll wish ya hadent
one does not simply land on the sun
00,10it's ok ACS13123, i launch at night
was there in fact bebop?
LOL!
ponibas: they'll go at night.
you launch at night so the suns not as hot, eh?
Sumica: How come I know that quote....
I can't remember what its from o.o
00,10Nitt why not retro burn
I think it might of been a memebase meme o_o
That is a retroburn
00,10ah. right, not used to the new orbital projections yet.
Herro everypony :3
00,10it's from some comedian
ello BroKnee
00,10I dont recall it
BroKnee: Sup bro /))
-_-
Seems legit]
Almost there to Luna
its about time you got back
00,10"orbit"
le fail
if you hit the little arrow at bottom center of the map screen, you get access to the navball
13not_doppler: It is the same client you are using.
hey BroKnee
do you reall think the mods are dumb?
00,10even though he has a collision paragee
inb4 shot down by Luna :D
i would have been faster if a noob wouldnt kick me
wait.... why are there 2 not_doppler people, i call hax :p
13I do not appreciate your repeated attempts.
sumica shhhh!
Dat lunar orbit.
That looks like it wont end well,,,
its ok
dont you dare crash if you made it this far
nah, it'll be a... flesh wound
eh
uh... you better start thrusting
00,10key to landing, dont do it in time warp.
how many meters to spare??
13If I have to kick one more alternate, I'm banning you.
lmao
IM NOT A SMURF
who was the 1st mod?
buh byw
huh
Darf14: Phase4
00,10uh does hitting count as landing/
smurf?
not_doppler: I would listen...
ok
second key to landing... don't try it with a super low peraph...
00,02suddenly ping
lol Sumica :D
Bunny_Maid_Luna: yd u leave
Sumica: Idk :P
Phase4 :p
GNIGHT EVERYPONY and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL AND PIERCE THE HEAVENS WITH YOUR DRILL
Phase4!
#Spike/join
your lateral speed relative to the moon gets too high
00,02Sumica, you in space?
/me Ohai Phase4 :)
00,10Cause I have totaly hit the moon.
Night Bronysith
A NOOB CALLED ME A SMURF
night Bronysith
phase4, it's nittany
00,10yes i'am in space
00,02an
really?
00,02ah'
Goodnight Bronysith :)
and then Bunny_Maid_Luna failed to join
hkfl;sd fdxkjkdfwq
Bronysith: go hit the moon like Sumica. In your sleep. Because awesomeness.
Nittany_Discord: What about flaming impact? Flaming impact is kool for a landing right? I mean they died...but they died...on the moon. So Im in the moon club right? -lol
00,10I also hit menus
not_doppler-mah-frie: you're quite the moron arnt ya?
;'(
13now cue the evasion
God that actually scared the hell out of me....
Nittany_Discord: be sure to pierce the heavens man
Sumica were you trying to land on the moon?
Shizuka: le evade
Shizuka: with the snipe
00,02Shizuka, dat kickban
00,10but how many of you have hit the sun
+50 headshot
crap.....
00,02oooo
I have
and that's how Shizuka take out the trash :p
00,02Nittany_Discord, u r orbiting mun
Serious Shizuka was serious.
I actually went THROUGH it in 0.13
Nittany_Discord: Do I HAVE to love fluttershy?
Dont buck with Shizuka
00,02nice ammount of fuel tooo
i wonder how long it will take for them to try and get back
/me Hugs Shizuka :)
13an hour
Ok ._.
the key to landing is getting the retrograde direction marker to point straight up (dead center of the blue half of the navball)
/me loves fluttershy
00,02Nittany_Discord, note that the ground is at about 1.3K on the altimiter
This is whre all those years of playing the lunar lander game pays off
hen3ry: I always thought it was dont die. -lol
*where*
How are you gaining height...
i wanna play Choplifter :/
Iron_Edge: well, yes, but that's the "how" for that overarching "dont die" goal
00,02Nittany_Discord, try land on the light side so you can see the ground before boomj
Oh its just at a weird angle
Shizuka...no evade yet?
hen3ry: Ahhhh, of course of course.
uh oh
DOWN!
00,02Nittany_Discord, allso the magic number is 13, below 13m/s on landing you wont explode
Darf - no, eventually if you want to land, you have to deorbit...
00,02keep it to ~8 when near the ground
13oh look there goes another
oh, it looks like hes going too fast
is this Phase4 again
Shizuka: hmm?
Whos voice is that?
13too lazy to whois all 134 nicks in here to find his other smurfs
00,02nope
also, switching from orbit to surface speed info helps..
00,02this is nittany
13but +b means he can't talk, so it's all good
ok
00,02think he's gona make it
Nittany_Discord: Well guys, were gonna die....So lets do this right. *turns on My Little Pony*
LOVE ME
00,10no only if we could do docking.
Here it comes, the moment of truth
00,10leave teh booster in orbit
that's pretty close actually...
13Iron_Edge: NO YOU FOOL, it's "gentlemen, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight"
00,02Sumica, that would be EPIC
13then you turn on Nearer My God To Thee
00,02and is how the real apolo misson went afaik
Shizuka: :D
lander needs an SAS
*croses fingers*
00,10then again I can barly keep orbit.
How come I feel dedd incoming...
or use precision mode (activate CANTERLOCK)
00,10i doublt I could hit a target in orbit
I wonder if there's going to be a need for a security department pretty soon.
DED
awwwww
00,10ouch
I knew it
:p
oooowwww
00,02:(
wow
ded
NOOOOOO!!!!! KIA 24
still scared me slightly though
such a buzzkill
00,10and that is why you dont land on the darkside
so close
ded
darf, I ain't getting those
Oh sweet celestia 0.0
...what did he explode in space? what
Canterlock mode may help
Luna laughs at ur crash :D
00,02i keep forgetting the adv sas on mine too
well.... at least we dont have to dig graves for therse three astronaughts
00,10also damn he managed to hit the talleist peak on the mun
00,02yeah, 1.7k
*these*
Just a small group of mods collectively known as the BSPD (Brony State Police Department)
Sumica: that takes an awful lot of skill.
00,02Nittany_Discord, i want to see your craft
Kandarihu: -lol
I try to land in the large craters, but I have a very stable lander now so I can land on moderate slopes as well
Pretty much dedicated to keeping permabanned users off the channel.

Iron_Edge: O.O Away I go!
00,02the game is in desperate need of instrumentation though
00,02like a proper altimiter
00,02:(
hey Om

MahBoi777: Ello
badum bum

00,10still say she needs a top to match
hi Polydunami
Wrek: The shape is fine, althought the end right side...Look at the throat compared to the necklace, follow the body size of that and you'll see it.
So one of the sides are missized.
But meh, minor stuff, nvm
The best part is the ending :P Pinkie said Donkey :P

05jsut messing with you Lunar_Brony ^_^
Wrek gee, thanks. I get sent to the moon and trolled by a mod. What a day
Guys, i need a hug or something. Rememeber that pic that was on EqD about Lyra licking a suger cube and was getting petted by a human? Well I just saw the fanfic its based on... Its... the horror... I dont even.... *crys*
Next week, Tour de France starts I believe
Yo

05Lunar_Brony: (that counts as rp the whole moon thing...)
oY
/me hugs Rex_Mundi "It's alright. What happened?"
05also i lvoe this version of this song
Yeah, I had my doubts on that animation as soon as I saw it.
/me Is telling other bronies in other chatrooms about this place :P
Wrek . . . crap
And I thought that was a salt cube :S
/me enjoys the nice calm music
/me So they join here :P
I like this song
hyy Phase4 guess what

00,02ohai

Lunar_Brony- its horrible... Its about Lyra, she becomes a sexually dominated S&M slave and mistreated.
?
oh well, I just won't RP, than. The more I use it, the more I like the name
Ok in my sorta boredom I'm gonna read My Little Dashie (For the first time)
Rex_Mundi that is . . . oh my . . .
Kakumy brace yourself
05speakign of salt cubes
you will cry
poor Lyra :(
Be prepared.
GET IT AWAY< GET IT AWAY!
Also, that
i read cupcakes before i went to sleep..... bad idea
Some one send OMG!!
I JSUT SAW THE LYRA!!!
dat lyra :3
05now
05for some metal
ok where was I... can someone send me My Little Dashie?
That Lyra pic really creeps me out
www.fimfiction.net/story/1888/My-Little-Dashie
Reading right now...
after reading "Rainbow Factory", I stayed the buck away from any and all "Gore" fics, including "Cupcakes". I also take a natural avoidance to clop-fics, but that was just disturbing
Sleeping right now...
00,10woooooo luna orbit
Chat is so dead my god..
who is drawing
Rex_Mundi Wrek
:D : http://derpy.me/DV614
Yeah, anyway, that Lyra pic. It bugs me because Lyra, a sapient pony, is pretty much eating out of a human's hand.
Dont read the fic then
what fic?
Hi everybrowni :)
/me sleeps
:$
Also, hey Derpy_Ctrax
Zzzz
Polydunami if I didn't know about the fic behind it . . . oh Celestia of Equestria, I can barely make through thinking about it
im still sad, how could anyone write such a story?
Nothing has changed...
k im back
Zzzz
Rex_Mundi same way people wrote "Cupcakes" and "Rainbow Factory"
Even worse, so many people on EqD thought the picture was really cute, oblivious to the horrible truth. The fic is like cupcakes
Howdy OneTrickPony
05i like how happy this music is
This song
hai Polydunami
this song :3
Ok the song not heloing me read My Little Dsahie...
You kidding? He's rubbing her ear and she's pretty much eating out of his hand EVEN THOUGH she should be able to feed herself.
sorry guys i can stand more time or i gona colapse i was awake the last 20 hours D:
That's the part that's kind of iffy for me.
05Dark_of_Max: lightweight
05>:3
bey
bye
05sleep well
why does this song soumd so happy
Im going to bed. I need sleep night guys
<Polydunami> Im serious, look for it on EqD, most people liked it and thought it was the cutest thing ever.
thaks Wrek
I will admit, if you are SOMEHOW ABLE to look at the pic without thinking about it's . . . history, it's kinda cute
Zzzz
And I'm back from a trip to the post office :D
hi MaidSurge
hi everyone
hai Lil_B
Yeah. I'm out night everyone
Well, it seems like he's treating Lyra like a pet rather than an intelligent being to me.
Ohai Lunar_Brony and Lil_B!
CAn i ask some of you for a favour?
Hey Lil_B
/me sighs
Bucking instigator?
Polydunami: I hate that attitude towards ponies :|
Polydunami- in the fic she is dominated sexually ans psudo-raped
05Polydunami: see it for what it is. it disregards that she's sapient more or less. so if you view the image as that, its ratehr cute
Morning everypony. *Sleepy entire chat cuddles*
wrek: How does Wrek's hair look on the backside? I have no idea. =/
I made this http://soundcloud.com/lilb-7/aria
Yeah, did not need to know that.
It's like I'm damn invisible..
Whatever bye
Hai FairysHuff!
05goes a bit upwards
Wrek: Talk to you after the stream about it
MaidSurge: Ohayo gozaimasu ^_^
MaidSurge, you know what I was talking about, right?
05you see that on stream Vordox?
Polydunami: some horrid fanfic?
The animation with Lyra licking a salt cube in someone's hand.
The story at the start is damn cute...
hey guys
*Yawns* okie doki loki. 4:30 AM time to sleep
Polydunami: NO LYRA DON'T GET DRUNK! :D

Polydunami just as this music plays, I click it . . .
Polydunami whats the pic
Oh now Wrek gonna draw wings and I saw Steam...
It's the Lyra animation.
thanks Polydunami
See, to me, without context, it looks like the human's treating Lyra like a pet rather than an intelligent being.
*Taps hoof waiting for the pony he's private chatting with to come back*
Polydunami: Or we could just not read into it at all and just enjoy it's cute ^_^
Can she not feed herself?
well im off to bed night everypony :$

05stream
05wings
05thoughts
i am ajioh
The 1st stream i saw in this website...Sumica playing Mass Effect 3
guys throw me a egg
Sumica: I be pleased with the vote for next weeks movie night ^_^
Hi Sumica and Phase4!
00,10oh wow wrek, i love em
it might scare ray
I'm Canadian, actually.
ohai MaidSurge
and alexxm it went well for now, yesterday just missed BMN since I had connection problems and Lil_B: yes
Although I have German friends
00,10good detail on them so far
I just noticed Fluttershy has bunny ears...
Oh god, bunny ears xD
00,10but yeah Phase4, the game is now crashing more then my planes
good catch there Lil_B.
Sumica, odd, i've never had a game crash
00,10I blame .15.2
00,10and the mod
ah, updated today?
Still has loads to draw..
Oh no, Lil_B, I got this nick from a failed Greek transliteration on babelfish.
yeah, i run mostly modless
/me eeps :<
that sultry looking Fluttershy there.
00,10Gonna dumop nova punch and keep the shuttle
sorry, meant saucy
I wanted my nick to sound cool but I realized too late how much fail went into this nick.
Next drawing a should be Cadance :D
00,10whos the colt?
Wrek himself :D
jkjk...
05Sumica: yeah vordox asked hwo the hair on my OCs back went
No worries
05so i sketched it out
Polydunami: Cool sounding nicks are over rated. It's like when kids would name themselves Sephiroth. Just make something you enjoy.
Ok now then. GOODNIGHT EVERYPONY! For real this time :)
00,10ahhh
Night Ponies47
FairysHuff Sephirothvegetamasterchief is best nick
Oh i was right,...
Actually, my nick should've been closer to Polydynamic or Polyischus, but whatever.
Mine is not close to anythung...
Lil_B: hehe ^_^ My point is proven. Or XxDarkLordxX ^_^
meow?
That colt in the background is damn awkward...
I mean that Colt version of Wrek..
Lil_B: I especially hate it when they put numbers instead of letters and alternate capitals.
Another thing, I came up with this nick about seven years ago.
Is my nick weird?
My next musical project: Learning how to use a full orchestra set of Sound-Fonts... by making the MLP Intro Orchestrated :D
05this song x3
annnnnnnnnnnnd.....
Lil_B: Names like XxSePhIrOtHxX drives me crazy
HE GONE!
Night night b state :) have a lovely evening!
FairysHuff I hate lots of Xs and random numbers at the end of names :/
Kakumy http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/f/f0/014Kakuna.png
night panda
panda: Nighty night
Is Fluttershy not getting a tail?
bye panda
bye panda ;)
Polydunami: rofl that is a pokemon
Sumica: do u kno which ep Aang accidently hurts katara
Well, it's Kakuna.
Lil_B: I can forgive a child for doing it as they don't know any better even if It aggravates me. But an adult should know better.
00,10midway book one
IDAS: OH THAT EPISODE I forgot the name..
00,10firebending master iirc
It's one syllable change away from becoming Kakumy.
Hey every pony whats up sorry i wasn't respawnding i was in a private chat with ponies47
k Sumica
ty Sumica
hey xxMoopyxx hows your day been
Why does LMMS crash with every VST Plugin thats not build into the Programm :(
Anthro Fluttershy
good just had to go chit chat with ponies47
00,10dare i ask why
Lil_B i have no idea i don't programm stuff
It's awkward...
I'm curious how the tail will turn out
I don't see how it's awkward.
00,10were you attacked by a pare as a foal?
No not anthro. It's just her posture making her look more human than usual.
She's still fully pony.
Do you not know what anthro is?
I know what anthro means.
She doesn't look human...
Actually, the way the ponies are normally are also anthro
She still has HOOVES!!
Hey ponies47 told me that fluttershy just bliked about few minutes ago?
Fluttershy can blink, yep.
i mean blinked
...because they have human personalities and such
She can also be icredibly cute and lovable.
yo dawg I heard you like ears
WAIT WTF DID SHE BLINK?
Well, yeah I can see her eyes and mane have been given humanlike proportions as well.
Dang it i keep missing that
Wrex is preparing to be the next new animater of MLP
She winked at me one time o///o
anthro is a really broad term depending who uses it
lol
Rex_Mundi: he can't be animator... they would look weird...
lol
DeadpoolDash i was just going by how i've seen some people use
There goes a right wing :P
rofl Copy Paste :P
Her wings come off!?
Hey fluttershy give us a blink at us in the chatroom if you would please for all of us
she's equipped with radial decouplers
:3 Fluttershy looks so pretty
isn't this cheating per say
Oh nuts.
alexxm: Using a comp at all is technically cheating. But who cares.
She just reminded me of someone.
Polydunami: God?
Jeez, I cant focus on the chat, the flutterdrawing is... distracting
Polydunami: do we want to know? :F
good point FairysHuff
Thanks fluttershy
that was creepy
No, I mean her expression and mane reminded me of Dahlia Hawthorne from Ace Attorney.
00,10if wrek was the animator they would have to move it to a 10pm timeslot
I havnt read fallout Equestria. Is it more based on fallout 3 style or Newvegas/FO1 FO2 style?
Y 10pm?
That kind of scares me a little bit :S
00,10Cause it would be an adult show =p
Sumica: ROFL TRUE THAT
what setting do I go to in order to make mIRC make a sound when my name is typed and color that person's words?
Sumica: I would watch it ^_^
Yeeeeeeee hawwwwwwww!
@Sumica But would it ruin MLP and what we love of it? probobly.
Polydunami: at least Fluttershy doesn't feign when she's being good/timid/lovable
Yeah, exactly
Bunny ears remind me of Haruhi...
00,10DeadpoolDash it's under adress book
Although both Fluttershy and Dahlia have shown rage before.
Flutter-chan is really an angle.
00,10then higlight
Hey don't for get the tail to bro
05implyign i forget stuff
The awkward moment when a pony doesn't have a tail :P
00,10she shaved it short and died it white
Kakumy: That awkward moment when you wish she was real.
heh lol
00,10er dyed
Is this what this chat does every night?
00,10nah
thx sumica
FairysHuff: the awkward moment when you hear a ring and you see the Mane 6
00,10we do all kinds of things depending on who is streaming.
Rex_Mundi: Nope. We mostly just sit in silence.
FairysHuff: AT YOUR DOOR STEP
Did she blink?
eeyup
Tervicz: yes... she blinked..
Wrek and kirz draw.
Kakumy: How is that awkward? I would be overjoyed ^_^ Unless I was hallucinating ofcourse.
o_O
She's alive!
Hello Everyone and holy crap dat Fluttershy.
hehehehhe
Ninjazz: What time is it where your at -_-
FairysHuff- a contest to see who can be quite the longest? Fluttershy is the world champion I hear.
Om: 5 or 6 or something in the morning.
*squee*
Polydunami: Indeed.
its 6 over here
Ninjazz: The coast then. I'm heading to sleep soonish xD
rofl it's 12:01 PM now :P Wrek too :P
Rex_Mundi: Shes also the champion of everyones hearts.
Om: Chicago.
*walks into chat* Hey guys, whats going on here... *heart attack*
I LOVE PINKIE PIE!!
Om: Holla
FairysHuff: Ello
hang on a minute
I LOVE FLUTTERSHY!
Ninjazz: I see, never been there myself.
/me is eating scootaloo and potato salad :)
Which of the mods love Pinkie Pie?
<FairysHuff> We should build a shrine to Fluttershy... Right after we build one for rarity.
Wrek is Twilight of course...
00,10check the about us page Kakumy
:(
Om: Same. So far... it's pretty to look at.
pinkie pie is best pony after all
Ninjazz: That's good.
Ninjazz, were you ever here for the Toy Story movies?
DeadpoolDash: you misspelled Rainbow Dash
Pinklight Dash is best pony!
I still feel poor AppleJack doesn't get enough attention. She is pretty much ignored. poor filly.
Polydunami: No. I missed all of the movies. :(
Omg I just noticed all 3 = Alicorn..
Aww, boo :(
FairysHuff: You are correct.
that is a strange way to spell Pinkie Pie rdibp
Sumica: episode 39 of Avatar all that goes through ur head is Holy fuck
00,10Wrek has showen Aj some love ^_^
:[
Pinklight Dash :P
I managed to catch all three and I was hoping you'd do the same
Sumica: Really? The rest of the chat should do the same ^_^
G2 Bon Bon is best pony... she bakes cookies.
Piarterityash Sparkle
G2 and G3 suck!!
G4 for the win!
G5 for the... whatever it will be like.
Pinklight Dash is best pony!
/me screams Rarity's name to the heavens
rarity is bestity
i cant imagine anything better than g4
You see, Ninjazz, during movie showings, there's a mod called Silverscreen who drops random trivia about the movie that's playing at the moment.
G5.... wonder what they gonna look like
AJ is probably the most overlooked pony of the Mane 6, even though she is pretty damn awesome
DASHIE IS BEST PONY U KNOW THAT!!
Ninjazz: You know if you say that in public, most people will thing you are talking crazy. Or about art
Polydunami: Ah, yes. I like Silverscreen. His favorite pony is Rarity, you know. ^^
Yeah, exactly
Humanized looks weird..
Which is why I brought him up :3
Lets get some AJ love goin here.
i havent been to a friday movie night in over two months, i hope that i can join one soon
05i jsut realized
05this will be hell
Megatron II is best transformer, yeeeesss
Om: The best pony talk must have atleast one Rarity vote in it, I might as well make sure her name is heard.
All the shadows of the feathers?
Rofl Wrek you noticed that the wings are the hardest...
Egad
GRIMLOCK IS KING!!!
05not hardest
Fluttershy is hell?
Well guys bye then...
05btu most time consuming
rdibp: he meant that it will be damn long to draw the wings
00,10what's that wrek?
05wings
Well bye guys!
can you take a joke Kakumy?
See you Kakumy
Wrek, do you have the 'song back in time' from back to the future?
00,10yeah but they realy do look great
rdibp: no i cant :P
:[
Just picking out random AJ pics to show her some well-deserved love.
OMG guys, what if the entire show... is the imagination of an autistic derpy with a snowglobe?! And that she does quantom leap home and the a-team never gets shot, and...
I like her ma...wings
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5410/
I like her everything. :3
rdibp... ??? :O
Also, I see a St. Elsewhere reference.
does anyone want some of my chicken?
Sumica: does toph love one of the four eg sokka?
toph love baby
00,10I dont recall she ever having any true love moments
toph and sokka made the first series for me
BBBIF
so is ledgend of korra getting a second season
yes
alexxm: yes
00,10she did kiss suki for saving her thinking it was Sokka though
rdibp: :D what a monster
Sumica: lol saw that
does anyone know what Amon looks like?
Crap. Did I miss Avatar's season finale?
thanks DeadpollDash and IDAS
so Sumica would u say maybe sokka?
Fluttershy: Y U NO HAS TAIL?
Ninjazz: no this weekend
toph crushed on Sokka, but didnt go any further then that
Why the hell do I know this song?
Phew.
its just im watching avatar atm
ANnd why does this song remind me of Al Bundy?
Ninjazz: season 2? :)
Oh god, that show.
Bbbbbbbad
MaidSurge: I hope!
Let's see... bad to the bone?
i know i know this song from somewhere but where
Is that the song name or is it something completely different?
Wrek: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5384/
05Tervicz: becasue it plays when he eats the burritos after peggy ruins his new ferguson
Season 2's final episode is when the show really became good :D
Yep, it's Bad to the Bone.
alexxm it kinda sounds like "Bad to the Bones" its a rather famous Rock Song so you might have heard it somewhere already
yeah it is i guess Lil_B
George Thorogood and the Destroyers
This song doesnt fit flutter
MaidSurge: i hated the fact how the show finally got kickass, than the season ended
05maybe not Rex_Mundi. but the one after will
05i guarantee it
Are youtube vids allowed now?
Tervicz not during streams
MaidSurge well, it would ba awesome if they would hold the quality in Season 3 as it was in the Royal Wedding (and the Badassery)
05Tervicz: never durign streams
Tervicz: Only when theres no stream
SO never
Tervicz there are times when theres no stream
Lil_B: I was talking about Avatar, but A Canterlot Wedding is ace too
No. There is no stream sometimes. Just now there is a person steaming.
05yeah this song Rex_Mundi
05fits her perfectly :P
MaidSurge XD, i only saw the last thing you wrote because i was away for a few min XD, sorry
But if there is no stream there is no one around, right?
Tervicz: And if you REALLY want to share a youtube vid you can PM someone with it so long as you don't spam.
Lil_B: Did you ever watch Avatar The Last Airbender? :)
It was just that I found the Al Bundy bad to the bone clip
The one where he rides the boke
bike
MaidSurge only the first Season
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5380/
i've only seen avatar on here
Lil_B: it's an awesome show
MaidSurge as far as i know the second season isn't out yet in germany, but i haven't wacthed TV in 1 years... so i can't really judge that
does anyone here know what Amos looks like?
Sumica: Garters for the win.
rdibp whos amos
hey guys I'm working on a PMV here is a preview of it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1th5_1B7D3Y
that masked guy from Korra
OneTrickPony|PMVing we were talking about no vids during the stream.
Lil_B: I think you can find torrents of the show on the net :) I got one with all 3 seasons
Polydunami: okay
rdibp i thought he was called amon
crap :[
Wrek: Is flutters getting garters? ^_^
MaidSurge sorry, i don't gonna Torrent a popular TV show , a friend of mine got cought a few weeks ago because he torrented a movie :/
Actually... back to g5, i wonder if it will be good like G4, or will the producers try too hard to make it like G4 and fail? I wouldnt be surprised if other brands try to imitate FiM (and fail) as well.
I knew it: Fluttershy has rather humanlike shoulders. That's why she looks a little more human than usual.
Rex_Mundi: who said that there will be a g5? G4 WILL LAST FOREVAH!!!
:O
Lil_B: germany is serious about it
well, it's getting late, so im gonna go to sleep now see ya guys tomarrow or whenever :)
Lil_B: Who doesnt?
I prefer Panty, though :3
Wait, are we talking about the show or the pic?
MaidSurge well, I think it because germ,any is way smaller than the USA XD, I'm downloading Video Game OSTS since 2 years on a almost daily bases and i haven't been caught yet XD
ohai wrek's fluttershy
just dont let it rustle my jimmies
Rex_Mundi: I wasn't, I was serious about adding Garters to the pic.
bye OneTrickPony|PMVing
I've never seen that show, Rex_Mundi.
I only know about how crazy it gets.
Bed time for me. Nice Drawing Wreck, and thank you for streaming. Good night.
00,10but they are a great idea FairysHuff
Gnight, Om. Sleep well. :)

Picture look's amazing good job Wrek
bye Om
http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5911912
amazing pic as usaul Wrek
This song.
Lil_B: needless to say, season 2 is really awesome and ended in a way that made fans REALLY angry :D
why were the fans angry MaidSurge
MaidSurge the only reason why i got angry was because the story at the and was rushed byond everything comprehendable for me :/
alexxm: Not enough fan serviuce ^_^
goodnight
bye Rex_Mundi
alexxm: hold on, I'll PM to you
Lil_B: you mean the movie? That suuuucked :D
I was just searching for MLP pics with Garters on to see if there were any and discovered that there are actually genuine WEARABLE MLP Garters ^_^ Buy your pair now.
I would, but I'm certainly no Corporal Klinger.
Suuure, you STRUT AJ's Genital, but Fluttershy Twilight Rarity and all goes safe... SON I AM DISSAPOINT, WREK
MaidSurge nope... I just got confused again and thought you we talked about the Royal Wedding again XD, sry (that what happens qwhen you have 2 conversations at once)
Polydunami: I don't know who that is.
Do you know what M*A*S*H is?
wow
Polydunami: Haven't seen that since I was like 6
some of us are showing our age
Lil_B: awww :3 I get confused a lot as well, it's okay :D
Oh. Well, it's pretty good, all things considered
Also, Angel Bunny!
Polydunami: if i was angel, i would hate my last name being bunny

GOOGLE LOGO IS TURING MACHINE! ALL IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD
now we just need a google pony
08,01for anyone who doesn't know yet: today is Alan Turing's 100th birthday
^
^
who?
08,01Alan Turing was arguably the most important scientific figure of the 20th century
turing worked on early computational science
08,01he basically invented computer science
the machine you're using now was made posible by his theories
Does Wrex have a DA or FA account he uploads his pics to?
08,01i might give a quick stream about him later, if i have time
08,01and teach you all about the Churc-Turing Thesis
08,01*Church
Wow Wrek, those wings are very nice :3
/me wants to see that
08,01and Turing machines
Rex_Mundi: Yes, he does :P
A DA
Ash_Cook: What the fuck?
Your name?
the wings are nice
Look at these people, amazing how sheep'll show up for the slaughter.
Why is it not DashWithRainbows >..

Rofl :D
08,01i suspect ponies don't either
Hey Wrek. What about a shadow on her ear behind the bunny years?
08,01when you're asleep, it's impossible to smile
08,01just as much as it is impossible to sleep standing up
08,01for exactly the same reason
08,01non-autonomic muscle control is shut down
Or I'd be flailing around.
Makes you feel good when you see a innocent sleeping person smiling, no?
I almost fell asleep standing.
*person is smiling
08,01RaveBrony: no, it makes me feel like they're not really asleep
You'd fall down, anyway.
08,01^
I would have fell onto some desks if I didn't wake myself up.
:D
I was like, "Whoa... I really need to sleep. No more staying up for 2 days straight"

Fun fact: Some times, albeit relatively rarely, you mind goes "lolno" and the part of your brain called the parietal lobe momentarily malfunctions. This part is in charge of keeping track of where your body relative to your environment.

I like My OC
Vordox how does your OC look?
This is turning out very nicely, Wrek.
Alicorn, Multigened Earth Pony, With an unique design and a quiet persona. :P
Vordox do you have a picture?
oh yeah i made myself an OC last night. couldnt find any cutie marks nor make one tho..
hey Lil_B Ninjazz and Obsidian
Lil_B: Only one, but it's not complete.
guys why does my work go unnoticed
omnipony: Get to it!
lol i dont really know what to put..
OY
Lil_B:
http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3129/vordoxpony3.png <--- This is my OC, still not finished.
omnipony spghiettie
like my hobbies are singing and im starting to get into DJing
Vordox are the white stuff ruffles? like Edgeworth's?
Lil_B: Indeed.
Vordox: whats his cutie mark?
Irish_Pony: Can't tell, would be spoilers.
:P
Let's say it's connected to Luna and Celestia.
guys why dont you apprectaite the things i make
Lil_B: But got to admit, he looks good so far, eh? :P
JRP2234 I like whatever you did you you should keep doing to draw/compase/sculpture/paint whatever you like :)
Not to mention unique design. <3 I love it
I just got to do the mane correct
Lil_B i compose music and art and noone apreciates my stuff
JRP2234: Make it better to make people observe you
JRP2234: If people are not into your music, you need to become better, that's it.
lol im no artist i made mine with the pony creator
Vordox yes, his face reminds me of older Eropean games that tryed to make manga like faces XD, but its really good :)
Lil_B: Well it's my first ever sketch of him :P
Vordox no its because noone knows it sthere
JRP2234: Then shout out
i did
Lil_B: He's far from done, but storywise and character he is done
Vordox story?
thats some good art you have.
JRP2234: Try and get into EQD?
http://soundcloud.com/jrp2234 then i tried this
JRP2234: There's still more improvement needed for you on drawing
Dat Wrekartstream~ awesome. also, good morning everypony
Vordox keep inmine i drew them ages ago
back
JRP2234: Time for some music listening of yours, brb
yo everypony
hey there, Ingwaz.
+|Laptop
hey Ninjazz
me tirted
thats good music as well. i have little money so i dont have any sound equipment but once i do i want to start making music
Hello Starflash
Oh and hello, Starflash.
bunny ear fluttershiy? :P
JRP2234 I draw and compose too, but i started with everything about 6 month ago, so I still have to get used to everything and I never did anytrhing like it before, it will take time before you make something good and before people start looking at you stuff
Ello ~
i take it wrek is streaming?
Yer
Look at the wrek in the lower right corner :D = wrekstream.
JRP2234: You're missing...something in your music
omnipony You could start with LMMS its the most advanced free-music programm
vocals
JRP2234: Only one of the songs had a small piece of something in it
JRP2234: No, not the vocals, the music itself.
ill keep that in mind. right now i mix music too so i use VDJ
dont have much money
JRP2234: There's no....erm..."Soul" in it
uses crazy expensive dj software
Vordox keep inmind im new to this crap
Nothing personal in them that stands out.
JRP2234: Okay I'll not give criticism then
the free version that is
JRP2234: there are too many silences when there should be something ^__^''
it makes it sound kinda blocky~
14hii
why ur music standerds to high
JRP2234: It's not
>.>
JRP2234: Its't he soul you're missing
JRP2234: The songs aren't..."yours" so to speak
hah, it sounds good though :D probably when you +sustain this it's just nice
JRP2234 you make good Beats and your electronic sounds are really good, I can't do any of that, I can only compose with some Instruments and Chiptunes http://soundcloud.com/lilb-7/aria
im new to this
well for chiptones this is really good
Anyways, keep going, I think that your stuff will sound a lot of better when you've created your own feel
lot better*
02Haaaiii
omnipony thanks
np
oooh this is nice and epic
14Ray :D
02Viri :D!
Indeed.
ive been trying to get into making music online because ive tried guitar and piano and had a not so well time with it. So far I want to add something into my singing so im hoping i can produce my own music.
14how goes?
Starflash exactly, nobody will ever be able to just create gold, expecially if someone has just started from scratch, I know people who took 5 years until they started to make music they could call good
02everything is alright :3
Lil_B: I think every attempt at music is still good though ^_^ especially when people keep working for it
omnipony dont you alread make stuff?
02you?
Hai everypony!
05love this song
you are thinking of the omnipony that makes dubstep. im simply a fan and also want to make music like that as well
Wrek: what song is this
Wrek i must agree

Tervicz: They'll be neighsayers
Not to me ;)
Oh forgot to ask
MrPoniator: Are you using rigs for Flash,and you made them yourself?
They'll be wanting attention
MrPoniator: Been seeing quite a few other doing their own flash rigs, is it hard to make them?
10Anyone know how to overlay images in Microsoft Word?
Yeah, I'm slowly building my own rigs for use
MrPoniator: Awesome! Hope it goes well. :D
Just for the sake of practise and that I like rebuilding the wheel myself
Breakfast. bbl
MrPoniator: True, the more you know of the core the better you can use it.
14I remember something related to right click then go somewhere, but I don't remember much other than that :(
14oh right
Hi :)
14image proprieties or something like that
Hai ACS13123
howdy, ACS13123
I was planning on making a rig that I'd share for everyone, but I'd say Double Rainboom is doing a better job at it
02Also
02Meet the pyro, monday
/me sets Ray on fire
02not sure if to :o or to :O
MrPoniator: Well, you're one person, not sure how many are working on that project
10Well Viri
About ten animators and then some
10I can do Insert > Shapes and draw a shape on top of an image
10but I dunno how to do it with another image
But Flamingo did make that Pinkie rig for the Present Prank one before DR started off, so there's that
02Hmm,
02Which word are you using?
MrPoniator: Hmm; Oh that one, yeah it was smoothly animated.
14D:
overlay?
You can send one image to the back
Is this rig something that can link together pieces like a skeleton?
or set the index back
if you mean that overlay
I'm not very indepth into Flash atm.
102010, Ray
02'k let me see
10Idk
Basically just the character model spliced into to many pieces for every part that needs to be able to move
13"What? Retreating? I'm only attacking in the oppisite direction!" <Genius idea
Ah, just that...? That sound too simple. O.o
Oh wait..
You need one for every perspectivel
Okay, that figures then.

10Those options are dimmed/grey
02Oh
10bring Forward and Send Backward
Phase4 you tried adding the launch option
WOW

watching this car go over
EMO CAR
00,02nope, dats the intro
00,02now we get to me driving
00,02i'm still new at this
Sylandest: That was Phase4 during his driving test ^_^
Phase4: Ohh, but that'll ruin it.. I mean, yay :)
00,02btw, this game is handling the stream epic well
FairysHuff: that explains the explosions...XD
so what sort of power ups does this game have
hehe
Prevously, on Blur, Phase4 Got 1% !!!!!
00,02^
see you guys later, going back to sleep.
00,02now to do that 100 times
bye WallDives
laters, Wall-gone...
Phase4: Start the game and stop?
YES, 100%, now how the fuck do I play...
This looks amazing :o
I usually just pause and mute the game streams as they tend to be all the same things but this I may watch for a bit.
Dat collision
ohshi...
holy crap, phase wasnt kidding. Mario Kart + Need for Speed indeed
no doubt
I agree with FairysHuff
I have Blur but was never any good at it. But then again I was playing with keyboard.
i didn't even know this game exsited
alexxm: Been out for years. You can find it on Steam

Phase4: Is doing a lot better than I ever did at Blur heh

02<Skylands> Now how do I save the picture without saving all the blank white space?
Night XAX
who made this game and why didn't anyone think of this before
00,02i failed
10I tried Right Click > Save Image as
02Well, you can save the picture as: "Save picture as.."
10but it only saved the selected image, not both/overlay
Phase4: Still doing a lot better than I ever did.
ths gme.. looks awesome
alexxm a company that died due to this games poor sales
The studio who made this game closed, I think.
00,02now no pings while racing
FAILURE
it's like you said..
00,02:<
10I just printscreen'd, pasted onto Paint, cropped, and saved
released at the same time as split second, with nither getting the advertising they neede
FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE
damn Chrysalis and Ninjazz this game wasn't that bad was it
Nope. Amazing game, really.
it was a really nice game, even had 3 way split screen
just sold poorly
alexxm: They didn't invest in marketing so no one bought it
So I woke up, hello everyone, and looked up the winners of the lottery
alexxm: Cause no one knew about it
not you?
Hello there, CrimsonPhoenix.
Still half-awake I only notice things that wasn't really interesting
hey CrimsonPhoenix you sleep well
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/21/ehghmoIA6EWQJ3XvFlVmcQ2.jpg
so I went and do some stuf, answering phone, toilet and all
lol, nice
:O
the post
where is it!
whats the post
I came back and saw the winner once more
lies!
It's a ghost post. D:
oh
THEN I SAW FINAL FANTASY SPIRITS WITHIN
OH GOD WHY
welcome back, Ninjazz!
umm, CrimsonPhoenix..
Hey I like that film.
it'll be on Friday night
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/20/lblJe-BeXEqRghdZSTZI4g2.gif
Movie might be good if not overly confusing but it has nothing to do with ANY of the final fantasies game
It's not confusing at all. Made sense to me.
Spirits within is such a good movie
08,01all the yay: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O4BGQPOgAa4/T-Tx72WtwlI/AAAAAAAAHXw/6H3yRs7eDjY/s1600/tumblr_m5c1sqSza31rptlpdo1_1280.png
Blur seems to be still on sale on steam for £14.99
not FF related
CrimsonPhoenix as i understand the final fantasy movie we're seeing is the one that had nothing to do with any of the final fantasy games
then again I suppose I would need to watch it again
CrimsonPhoenix: It's a good movie...it just needed to not have the Final Fantasy name on it.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Val doesn't come here often and he STILL gets picked?...
-__-
OtakuTom: Exactly. But if it didn't it wouldn't have gotten the views it did. So sales wise it needed the name to get butts in seats
It's like the whole Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and bolts
Rigged.
00,02i have a feeling they intend for this to be done with a different car
could be a great game...if it wasn't for the name Banjo plastered over it
00,02FUS ROH YAY
Ninjazz its fully random, so frequency of visit doesnt count
The only reason for the Final Fantasy part on the title is for more sales but if you look at as nothing to do with Final Fantasy then it is a relatively good movie.
or hell id win ALOT more
Ninjazz at least it isn't someone we haven't of until the lottery
and the mods would never lose
Right. Right. Right.
lol,. Phase4 no text while driving =p

00,02race finished XD

I have the special edition dvd set of Spirits Within. I really like it.
00,02accidentaly hit enter
"Mah sister is speakin' in fancy!" (Sorry, watching Cutie Pox on the Hub :P)
pfft
00,02so i'm using the dodge
I wish I had the HUB actually
that way I could catch on some neat shows
and finally watch tv once more
CrimsonPhoenix: Nothing worth watching on TV but MLP
hey now
Dan vs is neat
CrimsonPhoenix: It's all shallow reality tv.
CrimsonPhoenix: To each their own.
I wouldn't suppose The Hub were available to Roku users, is it?
and dunno but that tranformer caught my eye somewhat
CrimsonPhoenix probably the best non pony thing on the hub
and also aquabats
FairysHuff: MLP and Dan Vs. are worth watching on the Hub. I also watch a lot of Science.
i finally finished my OC :)
that as well CrimsonPhoenix
08,01exet
What does The Hub run during watershed hours?
omnipony: congrats! got any link to it?
OtakuTom: I haven't watched TV in 7 years. Got tired of the bull.
im going to get one in a sec
I know that feel FairysHuff
I miss stuff like CYBERSIX, Reboot, Redwall
I liked Brimstone but like many shows it was canceled
As was FireFly

Ohey there, Dken2021.
How I met your mother is awesome. thats not bias, thats FACT.
I've been going without TV for over a year. I don't really hate TV, but buying cable means that a lot of my bill is going to channels that I don't watch, like ESPN

Okay, there's that one school district where hugging gets kids in trouble. But we're not all like that.
though i'll kick your ass being a knight
Phase4: you streaming?
Take phsyical contact for example. People in teh west get really uptight about it. They assume sexual intention. When there could simply be a desire for affection.
/me sighs
knights can navigate around the whole board
takes f'ing forever though

NO
Phase4: Still doing better than me.

FairysHuff: I see what you mean.
Bleepblop: That would be most of society then
What we need is a good fan fic involving a story for Surprise and Medley. =P Actually I wouldn't doubt there is already something liek that.
FairysHuff: *brohug*
Phase4: NostalgiaCritic: OF COURSE!
In the church I go to, we hug each other all the time. No problem at all.

FairysHuff: prove me wrong? U dont just walk up to a stranger and start molesting them.
00,02the one from disney interactive
Phase4: Split Second?
00,02thats it
Moo
Bleepblop: Molestation is sexual intention.
00,02i played that, loved it
Phase4: Love that one :)
Yeah. I'm thinking the perverts see nonsexual affection as closeted sexualality because they want it to be that. They want to be validated in their obsession by ruling out the possibility that anyone isn't consumed by the obsession.
alexxm You ever hear of an internet comedian named the Spoony One?

00,02my steam name is Phase4 :P

14and I can't import it
14unless Australia
ONM explodes into dissapointment
Is it being streamed today?
00,02nice people, less than ideal pricing
what no CONQUEST?
14since it's region-locked for DSi and 3DS
00,02actualy better than gamestop
14Dx
Phase4: I bought a number of games there. Like the original Syndicate, NeverwinterNights Diamond Edition, Planescape Torment
does anypony know where i can watch wakfu episodes?
Jewel: what is streamed depends on the person who is streaming, so there is no set schedule
T_T
Not sure...
00,02Jewel, if Sumica wakes up
10You can only move all 6 of your team members once, then the enemy gets a turn
Ah ok. Thank you!
You might want to ask Sumica about that.
00,02well back to blur
Phase4: what are you downloading
huh i never heard of that branch of gamestop
Phase4: god i miss those stores, i used to go to gamecrazy :(

14Fire Emblem
14<3
10Disgaea sucks too :P But I love the anime and characters
EB Games is owned by the same company as Gamestop now.
i got to my store "spin shack"
/me 00,02hugs VioletGreySha back
/me hugs VioletGreySha
*go
10The gameplay itself is eh
Jewel: overall though, we stream anything from video games, to cartoons, to anime, to ponies
/me hugs Ninjazz back
hay
Know what we need? A download for the Blur soundtrack.
:3
Thank you Ingwaz|Laptop
:3
NOOOOOOOO
howdy, VioletGreySha!
14if you don't like that gameplay then there isn't much you can do :(
hay Sylandest
the site that suppose to have all the ep is gone D:
hai VioletGreySha
10Yeah
hay Dken2021
i am currently doing my first playthrough of half life 2
Oooh, I have never played this before :)
14oh wait
14don't spoiler me anything, but I want to know something
I'll just have to face it, my laptop wasn't made for DS emulation ;_;
CrimsonPhoenix: what site?
10I can sell it, but GameStop barely gives you any credit towards games now
a tumblr that had every single wakfu episode
14is there a function to see what the characters said during the game?
Jewel: not at all
Oh
Hello.
CrimsonPhoenix: nnnnooooooooooooooooooo!!
hai Ethereal
10Huh? Like a repeat of instructions?
Hello there, Ethereal.
14mp
Nice to meet you all
14*no
Hello Ethereal
i thought half life was ok....but this is.....so much more convienient of a game<3
I just realized. If the company that made Blur went under. Then who gets the sales money from steam?
14in Fire Emblem you could press Z and a list of things said earlier appears
thats a wakfu shaped hole in my heart that will now never go away. ;~;
10Not that I know of
robotdragon8: what is? ;o
14;_;
i am referring to half life 2
FairysHuff: im guessing theres a share of money from the company who makes the game and Valve
10The characters never said anything about switching team members around o.o
i see
fairyshuff whoever the company still owed money to after going bankrupt
can I post link to a site livestreaming Legend of Korra season finale in like 8 mins?
pony_1984: go for it!
14you can o.o
hey Ethereal hows your day been
10This game is brand new, not much coverage or help on it
i wanna watch it too!
Bleepblop: Probably. Which is sad
10I've tried Google
pony_1984: sure
http://www.avatardestinyportal.com/
Kinda crappy to be honest. I'm sick
pony_1984: Do it filly!
staaaaaaaaaars, of the midnight ranger...
14there should be a list of characters you can use in your team and you can switch them
You can find it on WarezBB
hope you feel better Ethereal
Thanks
Ethereal: u want sick? look for a tumbler called "futashy"
not many people i regularly chat with this week...
Phase4: Ouch that had to hurt
dat plane
XD
10Like, after you have at least 6 characters: Must deploy the rest in one of your kingdoms
...
lol
hax!
OMFG google is scaring me. I typed in "Ask princess" and the first thing that came up was "ask princess molestia"
10Kingdoms can hold up to 6 I think
I will sometime. Anyone mind if I link you all my FB account?
How does it know?!
ITS READING MY MIND!!
10So
14:O
i suck at racing games, mostly
>.>
Bleepblop: ikr
08,01Bleepblop: ask princess molestia is one of the most popular pony tumblrs
Bleepblop well that is the most popular tumblr
14gah why didn't I update my flashcard ;__;
10I want to switch my main team with the Kingdom deployed ones
08,01it's done by John Joseco, and it's absolutely freakin' hilarious
It tracks your searches
ikr
Bleepblop: Wow, that's what's really on your mind? :S
10Because they've got better Pokémon
Be afraid, be very afraid
:D
i like dat tumblr.....
08,01google knows you better than yourself
This is making me want to play Blur again. Shame I suck at racing games ^_^
10Conquest just confuses me greatly x.x
14I hope to find some aus seller that ships via courier
10I have no motivation to play it
robotdragon8: a trick i like to do in racing game is, especially in dragraces is, Id hit the nos and manually shift gears until my speed was maxed or i ran out of nos
Whenever I think of the video game Blur, I always end up thinking of the band Blur.
I'm going to get this and Splint Second. It's set and done.
10I bought it... 2 days ago?
10Played it on the first day, haven't touched it since

Ninjazz, I was busy, napping....
Right. -__-
11,01Call of Duty: Blur would have sold better than Blur.
I like the soundtrack to Blur... wonder if I can find it somewhere.
Ninjazz, No, I really was, I swear under my hooves!
10Bulbapedia reads, Europe: N/A still
FPS Racing? how would that work?
00,02Dken2021, like this

I meant I know in reply to you viri xD
*crash*
Dken2021: Lots of chest high walls ^_^
00,02i think twisted metal is 'fps racing'
LoyalDash: Oh I believe you. I'm just dissapointed you didn't inform us before leaving. :P
Yeah
14ah

10Punctuation plz
Ninjazz, It was a sudden crash state.

LoyalDash: I can tell. You didn''t even tell us.
Which was odd.
10Should I do bisonyes.jpg or what?
/me prods Nick
Sylandest, I'm doing well, except for the fact that I've been sleeping most of the day and stuff, and yourself?
FairysHuff: was there shooting in Carmaggedon? I thought it was just about running over pedestrians.
LoyalDash: doing good, getting ready for work in an hour or so

I second FairysHuff
FairysHuff: thats fairly alot of things you like

FairysHuff: I third this
Sylandest, Pinkie can get the wrong idea for a party.
00,02that was just unfair
00,02no one else stood a chance
LoyalDash: eeeyup
er sure?
The amusing part is some of you think I'm joking. But I'm not ^_~
FairysHuff: i believed you
although its a bit specific, how about for yes!
with exclamation at the end
:D
so Blur is essentially Mario Kart without any Mario characters and actual cars?
i didnt think u were joking
killerpony7733: Good pony *Snuggles* ^_^
Ethereal, So to speak, yesh.
FairysHuff nothing wrong with liking that kind of stuff
/me hugs FairysHuff

FairysHuff: fair enough i mean if someone really asks nicely i will ablige
*cuddles and snuggles Fairyshuff*
FairysHuff, Oh, when that happens.....yeah, that sucks.

/me is tempted to ask FairysHuff to choose one of those things from that list and sacrifice everything else forever. That's sily
Ethereal: *Cuddle wuddles back* ^_^
/me snoogles FairysHuff
That's why you should get to know some before cuddling. Served me well so far.
^_^ *cuddle wuddles and kisses and snoogles*

CRASH, CRASH, BUUURN, LET IT ALL BURN
And I do mean anything. *Hint hint*
Oh, and. *kisses FairysHuff*
Man, I'm about 3 minutes behind the stream now.

SO MUCH WUV
this game looks fun
and i'm back now
welcome back, Ingwaz!
welcome back Ingwaz|Laptop
what game is on stream?
Hai Ingwaz|Laptop
killerpony7733: I just view it as affection. It's rare that I feel romantic feeling.
BLUR
@Ingwaz, The game is Blur
Ethereal: Wuv is the best
FairysHuff: wub wub wub
FairysHuff: as i said can be very close attachment or anything beyond that
It is, FairysHuff. *huggle*
and it has stopped raining here.....
If any of you are going to the Edinburgh Brony meetup I expect some love ^_^
I'm not, unfortunately. I wonder if there's a way we could all contact each other though.
Ethereal: It's alled the internet ^_^

my town doesnt have a meetup.......i know other bronies in town but i barely get to even SEE them:(

FairysHuff: yeah...kind of wrong continent for me, so sorry

Phase4: Better luck next time
00,02FairysHuff, what do you meen?
You tried your hardest, Phase4 :)
Phase4: It said you failed

Guys, i'll BRB, here's my Facebook! http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003979191556
00,02FairysHuff, wait what
robotdragon8: Was about to make a joke about kissing in reply but thought better of it ^_^
00,02i just won that race
00,02by a LOT
robotdragon8 It's, like, so trippy, man. It
Phase4: Maybe lag?
10Idk how to do that
00,02srsly, lost the oponant for a minute or os
00,02so'
10I hate it when my parents randomly invite their friends over while I'm only half dressed
00,02holy crap, deus ex downloaded
Phase4: I am in Scotland afertall
00,02the crap happened to my internet
Hello everyone
Hello Cobellanez
00,02FairysHuff, lol, yeah. its gona be long over there
00,02ohai Cobellanez
FairysHuff: oh..my
ohai Phase4
00,02lets see how deus ex works quickly then bed
Hello there, Cobellanez.
hey Cobellanez hows your day been
Cobellanez: EVERYPONY! WUV THE HECK OUT OF Cobellanez !!
14ò.ò
the first one is kinda loose for me
howdy, Cobellanez
14why you are half dressed in the first place D:
I clocked in the stream delay to 3 minutes. So I'm still watching you race.
00,02'Application error' 'Failed to find Steam.'
ok *wuvs*
00,02lol Kandarihu
11,01Yay Phase4!
1011:17am
Hey Ninjazz, MegaMoonShine, FairysHuff, alexxm, Sylandest. I'm doing fine.
Phase4: Yeh I'm still watching you race as well
:)
And I see you having won
10Took a shower, slipped my sleep pants back on
00,02you'll see me lose the oponent for a bit
my computer said i was banned:(
00,02most games solve that by having the ai cheat
10not wearing a shirt, just cami/string top
00,02and giving it a boost
robotdragon8: Maybe you don't kiss it enough. It's feeling neglected
any idea why robotdragon8
00,02called 'slingshot ai' i belive
but its been going crazy these past few weeks
FairysHuff: kiss solves all problems? XD
I remember it being called "Catch-up" mode.
Phase4: Correct.
00,02while its cheep and feels unfair, loosing an oponent by beeing that much better than them can be anoying
Sylandest: YES!! ^_^ *Wuvs kisses*
10When I'm out of school, after I take my morning shower, I don't get fully dressed right away unless I have somewhere to go :P
Back.
Phase4: Yup
Now I see you getting out of Blur and chatting
FairysHuff: :D
wb, Ethereal
Thank you
Phase4: "Rubberband AI"
^
00,02ACS13123, thats the other name
00,02couldnt quite remember it
condom AI?
you would not believe how annoying it is to actually get that to work
Now you're looking at your download and reacting
Phase4: Still, just wanted to point it out ot others that might go "THATS WRONG ITS RUBBERBAND BLABLABLA"
to
00,02when did my internet get faster
00,02ACS13123, eh, if they care that much about what you call cheating ai's then stuff em
Phase4: Now your clicking on Deus Ex
When you turn off all the other downloads.
Maybe there's just low congestion right now
lawl
to be fair all AIs cheat
00,02and now you see the failed to find steam message
00,02Chrysalis, not all of them
00,02blur's ai wasnt cheating
Then again, when I download games on Steam, I almost always get better speeds than what I'm supposed to get.
how do you know Phase4
What I do with the rubberband AI: Go miles back, get good stuff, BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSST!
00,02i meen sure, they get car locations as exact vectors, but i'm not ging to call that cheating
alexxm: Psychic kisses.
00,02alexxm, i lost em, cant loose cheating ai's
ok Phase4
00,02plus the way they behaved was very clever for an ai, especialy one set to easy
Phase4: what you doin now then?
00,02trying to make deus ex launch
phase most Ais get MORE complicated when you set them to lower difficulties
What is the error it is giving you Phase4?
Brb. Need to go to the little fillys room.
Phase4: if that doesnt work, what will you do?
Guys
because humans have a tendancy to see everything an AI does as forward planning
cya soon.
so easy ais end up planning more to deliberately lose
he doesn't like PS3
Failed to find steam? wut?
00,02oh wow
00,02dats dumb

/me puts Custard in his eclair

/me hugs Ninjazz, Dken2021, alexxm, Phase4, Ethereal, FairysHuff
The first problem was that Steam misrepresented the release date as the 14th when it was actually the 19th.
/me sits in eclair

Who's streaming? :S
Satan
why would they do that Kandarihu
Mr. Phase4.
Satan? :O

I hear that the game had horrible, horrible bugs. They released bugfix patches every day for the next two weeks to fix most of the glitches.
Hello :)
00,02and now i'm waiting for windbg to not find a bunch of symbols
Hello Rainbow-Dash :)
Ninjazz: I know. Even I was like, wait what? O_o
hi :)
hey Rainbow--Dash hows your day been
Hi bronystate.
oh, hello alexxm fine thanks :)
hey FillyFlam hows your day been
FairysHuff: That one was a bit... odd.
Hello FillyFlam :)
After that, they made their first DLC, a free one named Mea Culpa. It adds the Patched Robe which comes with a Broken Sword and a Bug Staff that summons a swarm of bugs.
FillyFlam flam cant be a filly :P
Hello there, FillyFlam.
I have no idea what's going on on the stream. Should I feel bad?
alexxm: Pretty good, thanks. :)
Ninjazz: Like most things it just popped into my head.
ekips, not at all
Rainbow--Dash: He does what he wants, man. :P
FairysHuff: Sometimes, things should be best left unsaid, really. :S
6_9
Ninjazz: Never read anything into anything I say cause there usually isn't anything ^_^
dem Steam tabs
Phase4 try enabling vSync
phew, relieved to hear that :3
STEAM ALL THE WAY :D
/me remembers the movie from yesterday
:'(
apparently the audiosystem can panic if it runs too quick
/me hugs Custard
/me hugs alexxm
:)
00,02my sound appears to be breaking
FairysHuff: Very well.
What movie was it?
00,02irc client isnt dinging
I'm wondering if I should buy Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. Opinions?
Ethreal: You want to know?
Good game. Long as hell though.
Yes
Ninjazz: whats game is that?
Ethreal: Wait and see or check the newsletter
FairysHuff what sort of reviews has it got
Ninjazz: Rebellion? I'm thinking it's something like Warcraft 3 in space
It was relating the game to be patched, broken, and buggy. But the broken and buggy parts of the outfit can be replaced with equipment throughout the adventure. So by the end of the first stage, it's merely patched.
Bronysith: Sings of a Solar Empire.
Ninjazz: ty
hello chat, seems like you are active again ;)
Warning: Textwall inbound for Phase
In this eventuality, there are several things you can try:
Enable V-Sync as audio issues can occur if the game is running too fast.
00,02HOLY STACKTRACE BATMAN
Hiya Lil_B
FairysHuff: More like Supreme Commander.
Anytime, Sith.
alexxm: Apparently it's really good but the combat in singleplayer lacks a tiny bit
Phase4: holy marmalade of sweet sugary goodness
00,02Chrysalis, its crashing pre-video
FairysHuff do you want to get it
/me looks at stream confusedly
then try the second one
00,02and theres a 43 level stacktrace that heads through gameoverlayrenderer first
Oh, the Mea Culpa DLC also added the Magick called Crash to Desktop that instakills a random onscreen character. And the caster of the magick is always a possible target.
alexxm: I want to get it but I don't want to pay £25 for it. I'll wait a few months till it goes on sale
00,02ntdll.dll	 ?? ::FNODOBFM::`string'
00,02dats a fun function namne
ok sounds sensible FairysHuff
*looks at the newsletter confused* Um..Custard..
6_9
Yes...?
We watched A movie... Not B movie.
:P
Ahh :P
:)
YAY WE MIGHT BE GETTING STARTED NOW
Aww
nope.avi
I'm assuming the B movie for the euro stream will be Clerks won't it
00,02i'ma try what you said Chrysalis
/me watches them
FairysHuff: Eeyup.
Custard: Think I'll skip that one. Seen it too many times ^_^
if memory serves direct sound has been depreciated so it might be that its accessing using breaking calls
FairysHuff: Never seen it before :|
why do i crave mcdonalds?
See you guys for movie night! :)
So the person streaming is Phase4?
00,02yeah
MegaMoonShine: Okay :)
00,02i'm fixing stuff
Custard: Depending on your tastes it may take some getting used to. Like first tastingt coffee.
/me streches
Phase4: Ahh. Thank you for clarifying,,
/me stretches
/me sits on Derpy_Hooves
mornin
FairysHuff: Oh. Ok :(
/me sits on Spitfire
OH! I just remembered!! O_O
Spitfire x braeburn
Bronysith: :O
00,02Phasepony is helping with the debug
wha? o..o
You gonna sit on me next? XD
FairysHuff: Amazon is like eBay, so I kind of got it right. 6_9
Howdy
ZombieBrony: Hello :)
00,02interesting
00,02it calls into Galaxy.dll from a callback
yoshi>dovakin
00,02then dies on '~CJob'
00,02which is a destructor for a cjob object, whatever that is
Phase4: Are you trying to get Deus Ex to work?
00,02FairysHuff, yeah
00,02but via the most tech way posible
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2SYzacLiJ4 Linking to another Editors song for the sake of it
Phase4 sounds like it may be a threading issue
Phase4: LOL ^_^ Why not just verify the game files in steam. Always works for me.
Did the lotto happen yet?
be
HEY EVERYPONY :)
00,02FairysHuff, thats not the problem
Hello, Ponies47
HEY THER
00,02Chrysalis, probably
00,028 threads on this machine
Hi Ponies47
00,02and its that old a game
:)
Ponies47: Holla
Hello there, Ponies47.
00,02fun fact: i pirated deus ex to try it in wine, worked perfectly first time
ZombieBrony Yes. We got Tremors and Final Fantasy the Spirits within I believe.
FairysHuff: Holla or Hola?
maybe crashing because its doing too much at once?
possible
00,02that was a while ago, now i'ma actualy play it
Custard: Cola?
00,02Chrysalis, if thats it then i'ma uninstall windows and go full-time wine developer
Mornin everypony
FairysHuff: Where? :P
Morning, panda
Hi Ethereal Custard FairysHuff and Ninjazz :)
Custard: Bear?
FairysHuff: :O
ewwwww
Morning panda :)
who is more evil? yoshi or kirby
^_^
Yoshi
Hehe Ethereal Ponies47 :)
Good morning panda :)
Custard mornin
:)
00,02i'ts calling its destructor
Kirby, by far. He is a freaking psychopath.
*hugs everyone* :)
00,02whats happening is the driver fails to init
/me hugs Ethreal back
:)
wait, sound destructor
thats wierd
00,02so it kills itself
00,02and dies while killing
00,02Chrysalis, c++ destructor
I think I may have another short nap. As I think I may not be able to stay awake during the movie stream later otherwise. ~_ Damn you medicatioN!!
yeah i know
00,02it might not be a destructor and just an artifact of the name mangling
00,02but thats what ~ is
Phase4 you might wnat to look and see if there is an option to change the settings before you run the game. It is UT game and if memory serves you can change the way the game runs, be it opengl, software rendering etc.
00,02no opengl option for some reason
well it is listed as a class destructor cause of the ::
Back in a while everypony *Group chat cuddles n kisses*
00,02d3d or software only
name mangling wouldnt add in ::~
*cuddles and kisses FairysHuff back* Bye
/me waves to FairysHuff
00,02Chrysalis, but it calls directly into the destructor from a driver callback
Cya, FairysHuff. ^_^;
Phase4 you should be able to change one setting that will allow for more thand D3d and software.

Has anyone invented contacts that make your eyes look Eqine yet??

Just think. Every character anywhere who bears a derogatory birthname, just imagine what their parents must've been thinking of when they gave the kid such a name.

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Latin chants heard throughout the movie are adapted from actual Gregorian chants, including the Dies Irae. A portion of the Dies Irae music can be heard in the scene where Frollo kills Quasimodo's mother.

Dat mime.
there needs to be more talking gargoyles
entrance stage right
rdibp: Tom Hulce. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001371/
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Directors Wise, Trousdale, and Hahn have noted that the three gargoyles might exist only in Quasimodo's imagination and thus may well be split-off pieces of his own identity. However, most of their characteristics, including Hugo's infatuation with the goat Djali, seem unique to their manifestations when present (and there is of course the question of how the
soooo quasi's mad and talks to himseld?
1,11gargoyles can be moving around and even helping defend the cathedral if they are not really alive).
sergio_scriptor, three years :c thats like an eturnity on the internet
I swear one of the gargoyles remind me of Discord
I don't like his voice,though.it doesn't fit his voice

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: While Quasimodo is singing 'Out There', the camera pans over Paris and zooms in on a street. In this scene, Belle from Beauty and the Beast is seen walking and reading her book (walks out the bottom of the screen, to the right of the well), Pumba from The Lion King is being carried on a pole by two men (carried out of the bottom of the screen, but left of the well),
1,11and another man (in a gray blue tunic) is shaking out the Carpet from Aladdin.

Oh, I actually got to see Notre Dame Cathedral. But Quasimodo wasn't working that day. ;_;

DavidCortez: which one? Frollo is the Judge and Phoebus is the guy in armor
SuperBrony64: one does not simply win skee ball
sergio_scriptor: Actual gold would be crap.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the novel, Frollo is actually the Archdeacon. The filmmakers decided to change the character to a judge because they felt it would make him more sinister to have control over the city and therefore would not be questioned in his attempts to destroy the Gypsies.
I'm back guys

1,11Quai's voice is really unique for disney. He doesn't sound like someone who'd act as the hero, but there's so much passion behind it.
SuperBrony64: achievemnet unlocked. ringing the bell
HOOAHROAHZOHA
1,11And then best song.

Silverscreen: -NC
Inb4 best song
dat plain chant
where are the wooden planks and why arent they hitting themselves with them
FIRE HARZARD. :[
You know what? I never really was much of a fan of comic relief sidekicks. It's like they only exist to alter the tone of the movie and not affect the story at all.
Funfact: "Notre Dame De Paris" was originally meant to be written and published within a year, but constant delays struck Victor Hugo's plans. Eventually, under pressure from his publisher, Hugo sat down and spent several weeks writing non-stop, only coming out of his writing room to eat and to attend church at night.
inb4 awesome song
Suddenly Hellfire
Here comes Hellfire
this is awesome sauce
The best song - of disney history

Hellfire was a good song... and a terrible expansion
11,02HEEELLP MEEEE MARRRIIIAAAAA

Jar Jar Binks is a comic relief sidekick, right? Someone made a version of TPM that cuts Jar Jar out all the way and it didn't interfere with the movie.

why is it always the villians that has the best songs?

OH SHIT IT'S AVATAR THE LAST AIRBENDER NOW
pony_132 they are all really good, but my brain can't comprehend all the lyrics when its in another language, even if i can undertsnad it :/
Oh no, ethereals from X-Com
SuperBrony64: wat reference? mine?
heres the brotherhod
Meanwhile: Thanks. I was already here though. :)
theyre magicka mages
what does amon look like?
11,02FillyFlam: Yay :3
Malavolent, I agree
He's a firebender? :O
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Nostalgia Critic placed Hellfire as #1 on his Greatest Villain Songs. This is due to the fact that unlike other villain songs, Frollo isn't singing about how evil he is. Rather, he sings of his obsession and how it's tearing him apart due to his religious beliefs, and ultimately leads to him concluding that he must eliminate it through the "flames of hell" or
so much mana
Thats one hot gypsy though
1,11Hellfire.
FillyFlam: Just checking.
Lil_B: Then just continue watching this. At some point your english will be good enough
SuperBrony64: I would know, but I can only think of Shadow the Hegdehog :/
How did he know her name?
You gotta admit shes pretty hot

The plan is simple: We kill the Gypsy

Lil_B: Now I rewatch all the My Little Pony episodes in italian
HELL fIRE!!!!!!!!!!
HELLFIRE!
burn down all of equestria
I don't know how to bing people
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For the scene where Judge Frollo sings "Hellfire" and sees Esmeralda dancing in the fire before him, the MPAA insisted that the Disney animators make Esmeralda's clothing more well-defined, as she seemed nude.
/me referenced Diablo 1: Hellfire

SuperBrony64: they arent :<
hipster windmill
hi Shizuka
oh no!
SuperBrony64: paganism
Lol Snowball.
I guess gypsies can't understand him.
When a villain sings alone, no one notices. When a villain sings in front od people, it's seen as normal.
MaidSurge: Still haven't heard any songs yet
SuperBrony64: bc they are different that's all there is to it
gypsy wrap-up gypsy wrap-up
Silverscreen: :D
SuperBrony64: they're known to be "Witches" in his view

Or a butterfly knife<3
Lil_B: Frollo set it on fire. =w=
poor quasi, he lives with them
sergio_scriptor: Except singing Tesla would be weird
I still think that Gargoyles weren't necessary. Clopin is a sufficient comical relief.

Lol hanging in a kid's show.

RosePetal2: "Kid's movies" years ago didn't treat kids like idiots

I really don't mind the gargoyles, honestly. They don't break it up TOO much, IMO.

And then she falls for Phoebus
Lil_B: Also, the ace was the lowest ranked card, until the French Revolution. So being "Aces" would mean... lowest of the low
THE GOGGLES DO NOTHING!
That moment when you rewatch your favorite movie when you were a kid and realize how many references you didn't get until then.
PONY: Or Porco Rosso.
O_O
aces are high and low
ZE GOGGLES, THEY DO NOTHING!
dat french
Statues are snapping.
this song maybe unfitting, but I love it
dat snap
It's not a matter of whether one would love the job or not. They take jobs for wages that no legal citizen can be paid for. And anyone who has a problem with it is accused of being bigoted or xenophobic.
Go Statues go
Not only did pianos like that exists, but singing gargoyles were common too
pony_132: yup
snapping
DAT LOVE!
