getting to the moon isn't hard if you know the tricks.
umm
Landing, that's a little trickier
and to deliver....... THE PIZZA!!!!
you don't have to find the moon...
00,10yeah you need to use that rotate parts thing I was talking about.
umm
just get into an equatorial orbit
00,10I have had some good flights once I was told how to use flaps.
00,10Darf14, then go get it.
umm

is this nittany playing?
...
00,10eh?
OMG its work- no dont Jinx it! >_<

minmus is harder to get to.

Eztiothink it's still 18
TOOO THE MOOOOOOOOON!!!

SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
i like that movie
WEEHAHAHAW

HE SAID YOU KICKED HIM
WTF
Suddenly Fluttershy -lol
lol tough shit :D
him and i work for the same company
Hi:
:)
hey ACS
hmm slowly decending?
03!pint
03!ping
also protip... you can pilot from map mode, by activating the navball.
00,10retro grade should put you in to orbit
Lets do the time warp again....
that's prograde...
you can't land on the sun. Remember?
13not_doppler: You are lying, and are attempting to access this network with multiple clients from the same connection.
Cant land on Sun.... Challenge Accepted!
00,10joystick is hax
13I would strongly advise you shape up.
one does not simply land on the sun
LOL!
I think it might of been a memebase meme o_o
That is a retroburn
00,10it's from some comedian
00,10I dont recall it
-_-
Seems legit]
its about time you got back
00,10"orbit"
le fail
if you hit the little arrow at bottom center of the map screen, you get access to the navball
13not_doppler: It is the same client you are using.
do you reall think the mods are dumb?
00,10even though he has a collision paragee
inb4 shot down by Luna :D
i would have been faster if a noob wouldnt kick me
Dat lunar orbit.
That looks like it wont end well,,,
its ok
nah, it'll be a... flesh wound
eh
00,10key to landing, dont do it in time warp.
how many meters to spare??
13If I have to kick one more alternate, I'm banning you.
lmao
buh byw
huh
00,10uh does hitting count as landing/
smurf?
ok
00,02suddenly ping
#Spike/join
00,10Cause I have totaly hit the moon.

00,02Nittany_Discord, u r orbiting mun
I actually went THROUGH it in 0.13
00,02nice ammount of fuel tooo
13an hour
Ok ._.
/me loves fluttershy
00,02Nittany_Discord, note that the ground is at about 1.3K on the altimiter
*where*
How are you gaining height...
i wanna play Choplifter :/
Oh its just at a weird angle
Shizuka...no evade yet?
uh oh
DOWN!
Darf - no, eventually if you want to land, you have to deorbit...
00,02keep it to ~8 when near the ground
13oh look there goes another
oh, it looks like hes going too fast
Whos voice is that?
13too lazy to whois all 134 nicks in here to find his other smurfs
00,02nope
also, switching from orbit to surface speed info helps..
00,02this is nittany
ok
00,02think he's gona make it
00,10no only if we could do docking.
Here it comes, the moment of truth
that's pretty close actually...
00,02Sumica, that would be EPIC
00,02and is how the real apolo misson went afaik
*croses fingers*
00,10then again I can barly keep orbit.
How come I feel dedd incoming...
or use precision mode (activate CANTERLOCK)
00,10i doublt I could hit a target in orbit
DED
awwwww
00,10ouch
I knew it
:p
oooowwww
00,02:(
wow
ded
still scared me slightly though
such a buzzkill
00,10and that is why you dont land on the darkside
ded
darf, I ain't getting those
Canterlock mode may help
well.... at least we dont have to dig graves for therse three astronaughts
00,10also damn he managed to hit the talleist peak on the mun
00,02yeah, 1.7k

Pretty much dedicated to keeping permabanned users off the channel.
/me hugs all the ponies goodnight because he's too sleepy to do their names :D
00,02yeah, thats why i dont use it. imposible to sort through, that and using nothing but stock is a chalange
:)
00,02JRP2234, not right now
00,02like a proper altimiter
00,02:(
mean a radalt rather than aMSL?
badum bum

Just for the sake of practise and that I like rebuilding the wheel myself

02Also
02not sure if to :o or to :O
About ten animators and then some
10but I dunno how to do it with another image
02Hmm,
02Which word are you using?
14D:
overlay?
You can send one image to the back
Is this rig something that can link together pieces like a skeleton?
or set the index back
if you mean that overlay

aw :(
02Normal click on the pur pic
14o.o
02then select "send backward"
14why not paint?
14:D
02Paint is acutaly harder for this
02since Paint (normal) doesn't support layers
10Those options are dimmed/grey
02Oh
10bring Forward and Send Backward
WOW
Just generally asking
00,02Chrysalis, googling that now
10Image is selected.
02Then: go to Warp text
10Warp or Wrap?
02and select anything
02Wrap*
02Lol.
10k
10Select anything? o.o
02Try to put it behind text, or whatever you like
02It doesn't really matter, I think.
00,02found a settings file
YEAH
yeah but DirectX might of changed since then :P
00,02IT WORKS
00,02Irish_Pony, next time i stream i'll play this

and the mods would never lose
Right. Right. Right.

10Pokémon Conquest sucks
14o.o
00,02tell me if stream lags
14but..but...you were hyped a lot D:
10Kinda
10PMD is more fun than this
anymods has seen wakfu or enjoyed the series?
10I can't figure out how to change my team around in Conquest either
10It's completely different from the other games
to the TF2.
any1 know where i can find full episodes of Wakfu? Its in QUebex..
00,02FairysHuff, i'm gona check that site out later
D:
not Quebec
14well
Out of interest, is Legend of Korra streamed here?
10Takes too long to conquer the other kingdoms as well
14I can't play it, since it's not in Europe yet
00,02which is owned by gamestop
10The battles take time
Yes, sometimes.
14and I can't import it
14unless Australia
ONM explodes into dissapointment
Is it being streamed today?
00,02nice people, less than ideal pricing
14since it's region-locked for DSi and 3DS
14Dx
T_T
Not sure...
00,02well back to blur
huh i never heard of that branch of gamestop
10It's like Disgaea with a grid based system
14america/japan, y u no PAL
14Fire Emblem
14<3
EB Games is owned by the same company as Gamestop now.
i got to my store "spin shack"
*go
10The gameplay itself is eh
hay
:3
:3
NOOOOOOOO
14if you don't like that gameplay then there isn't much you can do :(
the site that suppose to have all the ep is gone D:
10Yeah
Oooh, I have never played this before :)
14oh wait
I'll just have to face it, my laptop wasn't made for DS emulation ;_;
10I can sell it, but GameStop barely gives you any credit towards games now
a tumblr that had every single wakfu episode
Oh
Hello.
10Huh? Like a repeat of instructions?
14mp
14*no
10Not that I know of
14;_;
10The characters never said anything about switching team members around o.o

i find it amazing how we are not even opening our mouths and yet we are speaking to eachother from far away.
00,02i just won that race
00,02by a LOT
10Idk how to do that
00,02srsly, lost the oponant for a minute or os
00,02so'
10I hate it when my parents randomly invite their friends over while I'm only half dressed
00,02holy crap, deus ex downloaded
Hello everyone
00,02FairysHuff, lol, yeah. its gona be long over there
14ò.ò
the first one is kinda loose for me
14why you are half dressed in the first place D:
00,02'Application error' 'Failed to find Steam.'
ok *wuvs*
1011:17am
:)
And I see you having won
10Took a shower, slipped my sleep pants back on
00,02you'll see me lose the oponent for a bit
my computer said i was banned:(
00,02most games solve that by having the ai cheat
10not wearing a shirt, just cami/string top
00,02and giving it a boost
00,02called 'slingshot ai' i belive
but its been going crazy these past few weeks
I remember it being called "Catch-up" mode.
Back.
Now I see you getting out of Blur and chatting
Thank you

00,02ACS13123, thats the other name
00,02couldnt quite remember it
condom AI?
you would not believe how annoying it is to actually get that to work
to
When you turn off all the other downloads.
Maybe there's just low congestion right now
lawl
to be fair all AIs cheat
00,02Chrysalis, not all of them
00,02blur's ai wasnt cheating
00,02alexxm, i lost em, cant loose cheating ai's
00,02plus the way they behaved was very clever for an ai, especialy one set to easy
00,02trying to make deus ex launch
Brb. Need to go to the little fillys room.
Guys
because humans have a tendancy to see everything an AI does as forward planning

HIYA everypony
hai Brony-FOREVER
00,02too bad there was a fourm post
00,02otherwise you guys would have got to see me debug the issue
And I'm back.
00,02well shit
I bought Magicka: Other Side ofthe Coin today. There were unusual issues with that release.
Hello everypony
00,02you get to see me debug a different kind of issue
/me sits in eclair
00,02it crashed in Galaxy.exe
00,02.dll'
/me looks at Ethreal
*looks at Custard*
-_^

/me about to mute the noise
They made mistakes, and did everything they could to fix it as quickly as possible.
00,02i just broke something
00,02Chrysalis, kinda, vac cause of the stream
Hello everypony
Did I really just say that? O_o
I remember yesterday's movie. :'(
Hello :)
never saw that though
Hello :)
00,02and now i'm waiting for windbg to not find a bunch of symbols
hi :)
I have no idea what's going on on the stream. Should I feel bad?
6_9
phew, relieved to hear that :3
/me remembers the movie from yesterday
:'(
:)
00,02my sound appears to be breaking
00,02irc client isnt dinging
Ethreal: You want to know?
Yes
Ethreal: Wait and see or check the newsletter
Audio Stutter/Game Crashing Due to Audio Subsystem
In this eventuality, there are several things you can try:
Open deusex.ini (this can be found in the "Deus Ex\System" directory) and locate the [Galaxy.GalaxyAudioSubsystem] section, before changing the value for UseDirectSound to false.
00,02Chrysalis, its crashing pre-video
/me looks at stream confusedly
then try the second one
00,02and theres a 43 level stacktrace that heads through gameoverlayrenderer first
00,02ntdll.dll	 ?? ::FNODOBFM::`string'

00,02then dies on '~CJob'

00,02fun fact: i pirated deus ex to try it in wine, worked perfectly first time
maybe crashing because its doing too much at once?

Kirby, by far. He is a freaking psychopath.
*hugs everyone* :)
/me hugs Ethreal back

wait, sound destructor
thats wierd
00,02so it kills itself
00,02and dies while killing
00,02Chrysalis, c++ destructor
yeah i know
00,02it might not be a destructor and just an artifact of the name mangling
00,02no opengl option for some reason
00,02d3d or software only
name mangling wouldnt add in ::~
Hey y'all!
:)
Hey
sea ponies song>this day aria
well it might be failing in the constructor then
as its trying to setup the callbacks
and triggers the destructor
BRB
Ok.
OH! Thank you for the clarification Ethreal
