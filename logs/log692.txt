I may have to back out now, before I grab a flamethrower.
On exceptionally rare occasions, it's used right and amusingly. In practically all others, it's not, and not.

Posting them publicly during a stream, it is.

Did you know that a fanfic writer in the fandom recently got a novel published?

Hello everypony.
Apparently the monster was hidden in the movie poster
^
I remember Teletubbies. :D
izzy's even younger.
FUCK YEH!!
dialga=t.a. giritina=r.d. palkia=i.s.
A little TRIVIA: ''CLOVERFIELD'' was originally supossed to be the codename for the movie, but instead, it turned out to be the ACTUAL TITLE! <------
00,10this movie got my 7 bucks because they made it seem intersting. I was disapointed
Okay.
Why the FUCK is it even called Cloverfield anyway?
6.47 am, if that were me trying to slap, id already have shoved that camera up his-
The SMB Movie would be worth riffing
I needs sleep? I got Rifftrax :P
*trying to sleep
*Who
/me this moment has been brought to you by UPS
13the end of the movie involves nuking central park, thus the codename (and the note at the start saying formerly known as central park)
oh this is Cloverfield movie?
i've seen this movie before.
00,10more transformers rips
ok the stream is moving smoothly now :)
this movie any good?
Still waiting for a sequal to this - or at least more monster movies like this
Same here, didn't hate it but was disappointed.
13sub06905|TARDIS: not really, thus the riff
What's up with those lines that are higher pitched? Is one of the riffters or was that an effect?
then i shall enjoy the rifftrax :$
. . .
13even though NONE OF THAT is explained in the film
hey every pony
*stupidest
oh dam, no-one shakes the camera that much
00,10the first of many motion sick pukes
it's like they shook it on purpose
13and it revolves around japan because godzilla
13ah there she is the only likable character in the whole movie
00,10this movie could have been twice as good if they just invested in a steady cam
I think the baby must be Godzuki...y'know...from the cartoon? ...Watch it peoples.
even if they just stuck it on someone's head it would be relatively steady
0,14oh hai everyone
00,10I said twice as good
0,14so we're watching one of my favorite movies?
soo someone comentating cloverfield?
why is the camera being held non-level
0,14SWEET
dat extra
00,10we should watch skyline next
13i didn't say it was a *good* plan
00,10yeah it would go great with this

0,14there are people like this in Manhattan

0,14this is part of the reason I liked how that borough got wrecked
00,10main dude
You know, this movie reminded me of Blair Witch, camera and all
I hear Gorillaz
0,14also, dat Gorillaz
13Eddmario: nah that's anything produced by the epic movie guys
00,10and the entire budget of this film when to this 30 second loop of gorlliza
0,14XD
The ONLY good part about this movie is the music
13sorry .-.
13um ponies?
13just lie back and think of ponies
GORILLAZ! F*** YEAH!
*movies
00,10even the camera is drunk
epic movie with ponies?
hey guys i cant help but think ive missed somthing
13i'll give them credit for the editing in this film since it's not one continuous shot by any stretch
0,14we passed by the chick passed out on the couch right?
In this segment the Buddha isdrunk
0,14ah
Bye, Eddma- gone.
13in that segment the buddha is holding a camera in one hand and a PBR in the other
00,10can we just nuke them now?

0,14it's coo' XD
I just finished reasing Bridge in Background Pony from shortskirtandexplosion....
00,10Everlasting_Joy, that is not posable
why this movie??
00,10that would be like haveing too much dakka
0,14actually, to get the FULL story, you need the Blu-Ray
Because Rifftrax.
and people say MLD is the most tearing piece of litterature of the fanbase
0,14ARG has such a little payoff in the movie
13DARK: cause let's face it, no one was voting for this movie anytime soon
lol ^
0,14Super 8 was alright
In that segment the buddha just ninja'd someone for the millionth time
0,14not shakycam, at least
good bye everyone
it was
well that's good
00,10the only think intersting about super8 was the interactive trailer
0,14Super 8 was essentially, "What if JJ Abrams made a Spielberg movie?"
13oh marlena, if only you didn't get a bridge dropped on you
Yes, Lily! Tell us while I film this on his Goodbye Documentary

0,14bit him in hald, didn't like-
Wait it ate the cameraman?
00,10but top half
the pasing of the camera
and it's STILL chasing him
Where did the monster go after eating Hud?
13back to the pocket dimension it was hiding in before the shot
0,14so fun fact: this is the greystone (or so) bridge
00,10it came down on him from above
0,14HOLY SHIT
damn 14 minutes left

0,14I've been there

/me used to live down the streeet from comic con >.>
WHY IS IT CHASING TWO HUMANS
13otakon: it's wandering aimlessly, military's about to nuke the city
AND Y U NO ARRIVE AT THEM
0,14to that bridge
Wait a minute, it was night when they got in the helicopter, and it was day when it crashed. DA FUCK?!?!
00,10we
Ohai*
00,10realy took the time to sound air raid
lol
:P
Okay hold on
yup
HOW did this tape SURVIVE a nuke?
13magic
0,14who said it was a nuke?
13actually
JAYSON!
0,14it's like a MOAB
His name is Rober Hawkins...
3
MOAB?
2
0,14actually, they did say it was a MOAB
1
13SaxyPretender: the title cloverfield, meant to be a codename for a nuked zone, since clovers are the first thing to grow back
gota get dat moab
0,14that was the popular theory
0,14buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
13though
and nuked
13yeah that's not a nuke
0,14the only reason it's called that
13aaand there's the satellite that kicks off the movie
and that is where it ends
0,14is because there was a street called Cloverfield outside of thr studio
Everybody get ready to NOT see the ufo even if you're looking for it.
0,14JJ Abhrams liked the name
0,14that's literally it
where is this, Disneyland?
Good news the pony survived
oh, Coney Island
and that was the end?
0,14so the bomb is not a nuke, it's a Fuel-Air Ordinance Bomb
it found its way to equestria before the nuke
yeah that's it
ugh
0,14also
That was it...?
wow, that was dissapointing
THAT was it?
0,14depends on who's being asked
13and yeah
13that was it
00,10droping a moab is also BS
0,14or....
13nah people say the credits music is good
And was it just on a temper tantrum or something?
0,14still alive
13i haven't sat through it though
0,14btw, would people be okay, if I cleared up plot details with a +m?
13go for it :3
whos streaming
inb4 +m
HOLY SHIT/10
...Oh well, maybe we'll find out...never...
6Gtg..see you guys!
0,14alright guys
0,14so, a few key things
cya
13i mean it's an alien not a monster woken up
0,14THAT is not the only monster

:(
13anyone hearing godzilla theme tribute here
00,10they had to tribute somthing
0,14the ticks eat that too
13it takes this many people to make a movie suck this bad
0,14so raw sea necter + blood = BOOMER
13cause that makes sense..
00,10all I am hearing is bullshit bullshit retcon retcon
0,14oh yeah, the satellite at the end clonked the monster and woke it up, i think
0,14aand the kicker?
0,14highest one a civilian can get
13how exactly did the satellite fall intact enough to wake a monster presumably way down in the ocean without making a bigger wave
0,14oh no wait
0,14it was awake before that
11,02so many colors
0,14it attacked a off shore oil rig

0,14there was a manga, Cloverfield/Kishin
0,14liscened by JJ
0,14I do believe it's in canon
13see kids, if you're going to make a movie, put plot details IN THE GODDAMN MOVIE
0,14which means humanity is FUCKED if its siblings wake up
0,14okay, I'm done
13in summary, japan
13all you need to know
11,02Alright, time for my announcement
11,02Dat is all :3

yes it is - yes, you'd have to account for the weight when building the supports

I'm back. Stupid f*cking chair . . .
the road itself would absorb more of the force, rather than all the structural supports
yes, the resonance caused the collapse, but only because the road wasn't build thick enough to absorb it

i would point tword wikipedia but it would get yelled at

we have a garbage chute on every floor. all the trash goes into a non-transparent plastic bag and down there
Yeah, use bullshit to denounce bullshit :P
now if we had that many trash cans in every house
Then again, it is proving a point
in the end, they burn it all in the same power plant anyway
4chan is complete rubbish
because it's 4chan
requires no explanation
were you there for the war? i think not!
Didn't bronydom start at 4chan?
it did
My problem here is that even if we accept the problems of recycling as they show them, it doesn't really justify throwing things we could recycle in the landfills.
or whatever
you probably heard of it
local grocery store parking lot used to have a can crushing machine - that was taken out in around 95 - dont think there are any left now
too many people automatically assume 4chan = /b/
Yeah, that was not the fault of 4chan. I should not have to let you know that there are people behind those keyboards.
people just prefer to go to LE REDDIT XDXD and such because they can't handle people disagreeing with them
13our can crusher actually broke >>
and being honest
13LELELELELELELELELE
those old can crushers are harder to find than phone booths]
All these people are saying is bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
well...it was /co/...the wars on /b/ did their part too
more political nonsience

Sorry guys, I have to get some sleep. Good night and enjoy Shizu's stream! :)

VAC?
DO IT NAO
13stupid vac....
13there we go
woot
13didn't buffer, just paused while i poked around
oh
Take care, everyone. :)
ok, ignore me
putting people in threadmills for energy production can create millions of jobs
and it's eco friendly too
"running out of space"
bullshit

trash energy works.... it's suuuper stanky though
wait i mustve msised something, how is it worse for the environment
:O
i thought it was going to end up with biat. but .....
How the governemt works.
it doesn't
13there it is
13oh... i wasn't even close with my estimate
it's pandora
:3
13penn's pretty hard libertarian, the problem with government funded makework is it's government funded makework
13that's taking money away from consumers that would otherwise be put to uses the market actually wants
ie roads
13well... government is DAMN good at wasting money
^^^^
money is Supposed to be wasted on these things
13no it isn't, money is a method of transferring effort to goods
...power from decomposing garbage? ...AWESOME!
13taking money and diverting it to things the market doesn't actually want has vastly worse consequences down the line
He;;s not kidding those landfills really do burn methane for power
MANDATORY
13the collective might of millions of humans is more efficient than the decree of a few politicians
Assuming it fails.
would you do it?
13but also, everyone should be required to read this http://steshaw.org/economics-in-one-lesson/
13who do YOU think does it?
^
obviusly the government isnt being honest
13no see you're thinking in zero sum terms
THIS
Oh thank you Shiz
The ep about swaering!
THIS is one of my favourites
but since we cant do anything about it unless we go into politics, we should at least spend the money to slightly improve the ecology
:D
BURN
We go from Trash to Spongbob Trash talking
working off the clock
more trash tv?
Night night bstate!

13pony_1066: inaction in something you're focusing on, but it becomes action in something else that otherwise wouldn't get done
I expect that kind of talk from Denny's but this place?
fuck fuck fuckity fuck
13mmm anarchists
13the most idealistic of all~
00,10well that felt like an exploit if I ever saw one in PS2
13spoiiiiits~
Mekrob
I can think of 8
was that a George Carlin reference? :3
13sort of, as i recall he has fuck and motherfucker, which is a bit redundant
It's dangerous to confuse libertarians with anarchists. In the face of overbearing government, it's hard to tell the difference, though.
Hello everypony!! :)
ahh George Carlin, probably my favorite comedian ever
mornin' everypony
13those with the biggest guns gather the power and you end up in a monarchy
:D
this is me when i play TF2]
:D
you said the bluluva
anarchy is unstable. you can see it in every slum of the world. gangs deliver security and take political power quite fast
This is me when I play anything:p
13dat face
:D
Screenshotted
woah
13favorite part of the episode there
13dammit vac...
he said some things <_<
DADADADADDADADA
This is anarchism in its proper form, not that nonsense the media has impressed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism
13starts stuttering like that
no stutter on our end
00,10oh
Is it never going to be revealed?

Bedtime for me - Goodnight

13hm.. any fix?
13yeah clear now
00,10too much data and it's fillinf the buffer
13hm
00,10tends to happen if you have alot of things runing or you run low on memory
13definitely not low on memory, 5 of 8GB free
13cpu's about 30% across six cores
13pretty standard
00,10but mostly it's just VAC is wonky
13still need to look into that...
And of course you have the PPG episode like the Spongebob one where they learned to curse
13will probably do that when back from illinois
This was preceded by Tiny Toon Adventures, you know.
G'night everypony!
yep, i agree

but it doesn't last

13you can't be completely post-scarcity, there is a finite amount of matter in the universe, and a miserably tiny fraction of it within humanity's reach
there are however hints to creating matter from energy
:)
I do believe I am calling it a night now. Sleep well my pony folk, like young Rarity is. ;)
/me bows and takes his leave
13co2 is a pollutant, everyone stop breathing right now
/me holds his breath :<
gaia smiles
I died.
13i want to know the metric of how much co2 we put out as part of manufacturing etc compared to the sum total exhalations of every aerobic organism on the planet
13Sumica: give you two buds for it :3
00,10wooooo
00,10especaly how they are on paper.
00,10it's like ironic
humans produce 2 billion tons per year, combustion and industry 31 million tons
I'm off. See you all later. :)
oh wait...31 billion tons
Hoo boy. Cap & Trade. We gotta be on the lookout for that.
its 31 million
13yeah millionen is million
he corrected it one post later
humans are idiots...
The solution to excess CO2 is simple. PLANT MORE TREES!
13milliard was brit usage for a while too but slowly moved to billion, as far as i know
13true dat
/me live in Christchurch. STILL lots of rubble here.
english million, billion, trillion
It's a heck of a lot of fun, though :3
*too
/me 13hasn't played pool in years...
I just won 10$ off my father..
13was vaguely competent at it.. virtual pool with tracer lines does actually help you line things up in reality, assuming you can hit straight >>
Oh, Yahoo!.
it was on the Beeb
Why are we talking aout pool now?
because pool
Hoi
where it matters, we use x*10^y anyway

Moderating?
13i'm sure.....whichever province is north of minneota, manitoba i think... is a horrible place in winter
Hmm, I never heard about that.
yep it fucking rocks
Yeah, my grandmother had plenty of stories of her hometown of wintery Winnipeg
Few horrible blizzards, tornadoes, storms...
Yeah, we have an island to the west of us.
Still, a sea climate.
Aw
Well, look at us ponies talking about the weather :3
13so that's... political ideology > CO2 > millions milliard billions billiard > pool > weather

That pretty much summed up this conversation.

o.O
'Die hard commie' i think....
13i tend to fall on the right side, couple things i'm not thrilled with the more hard line republican stances but that puts me more in the libertarian category than anything
/me is definately me
*one
Yeah, I know about savouring each and every bite
Yeah. I'm kind of that way too.
/me wants to try balut some day :3
13tbh i generally set my alarm to wake me up to rush, but more because my brain just can't stand to sleep in during OPEN LIIIIINE FRIIIDAAAAAAY
13that is when i'm actually using my alarm, otherwise i just follow /r/libertarian and filter out the OMGTWOPARTYNOTFAIR
13also "upon sighting a tank" http://i.imgur.com/iMhVO.jpg
13coach's face looks more like he sees a tank made of chocolate
Dang it, now I'm salivating :D
