I used to wonder what buffering could be, but then you shared its magic with me
The_Awesomeness, I hope you'll get the little guy to a vet soon.

08,01okay, i've stopped streaming; does sumi's show up now?
im going to stick up lost cat signs but it doesnt have a collor so im kinda doubtful its owner will come looking for it
13this is why we don't ninja streams -_-#
The_Awesomeness, well enjoy your kitty. Considering you rescued off the street, it's going to thank you for the rest of it's now-prolonged life.
I think its probably because of the skydive thing and now the internets is all crowded up o.O
it was starved when i found it so i doubt it wouldve lasted much longer
pot80, the internet is getting lagged from everyone obsessing with the supersonic skydive?
08,01okay

but Shizuka sumi ninjas streams all the time and he doesn't have problems

Hmm, someone has made wolfpuncher 2(tm)

Is the stream being laggy for anypony else?
Rex_Mundi: why? classic doom music lol
Stream laggy for me as well.
RedPegasus|Knight: yep its really laggy for me

killerpony7733: Hey, I didn't say they all improved on it! :D
GilDash: Lots of blood
if you've never played Doom, go and bloody play it.
GilDash: idk i was thinkin of the Megaman Deathmatch w/ ALL the Mods! :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: To be honest, when I think of Deathmatch the first thing that comes to mind is the old Unreal Tournament.
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbqlmn7lBS1rbonovo1_1280.jpg
yes it is XD wow this feels kind of weird because he can read the comments
GilDash: oh i meant this doom mod i saw on YT and it looked pretty fun,lol plus ya can play as any boss from MM
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Fair enough. Never played MegaMan. :S

Doom's story: Demons invaded. Kill them all. Pretty much it. XD
Eli: IKR?
is that guy on the bottom chucky or somthing
GilDash doom 3 tried to do that different
thats doom guy
back when fps games didn't have stories, you just killed stuff and moved on the next level
oh
so true Zephyr
killerpony7733: Now, I like Doom 3. I really, really do. It's not quite "Doom" to me though.
http://i.imgur.com/FzAzz.gif to much dawww on this
dust monster?
13inb4 nopony here remembers my doom 3 stream... or nittany's for that matter..
GilDash Oh yeah Doom 3 was indeed a good game from most games due to keeping to most of it's roots though it really really tried too hard with jump scares but the atmosphere was good
Michael: :3 cute
Shizuka I did
I remember enjoying it a ton
boom headshot
Shizuka I remember you using the shotgun a lot.
11,01Never finished Doom 3.
killerpony7733: Doom 3's biggest failing was the heavy use of scripted scenes. It made it the same game on every playthrough.
Shizuka: I remember!
thelonepony: the animations are just aweseme
Hooray for Portal 2
11,01Shizuka used cheats. I didnt'.
GilDash Oh yeah that.
*awesome
It is Michael
13only godmoded once .-.
killerpony7733: If they'd focused more on actually gameplay AI, I think it could have been even better.
11,01Scripting is a problem with mainstream shooters.
11,01I wish FPSs evolved into games more like Turok 2 and less like CoD.
11,01At least SP-wise.
Oh, Turok 2... what a game.
i find it pretty awesome that one guy takes on the armies of hell
Wow thanks for reminding me of Turok
Never did get to finish that... :(
amazing level design

08,01it's only a few chords; took me approximately 30 seconds to figure out
What is on stream?
Lasharus which do you hate more
bieber or gangnam
/me dances gangnam style
'hate more' is a relative term.
yes
then give the relative answer
id rather gangnam keep the top spot
than let bieber take it
The lip sync off for anyone?
whats the point of getting people all to vote on one day
why not just tell them go like that video
DerpyMuffins: For me yea.
you only get 1 dislike anyway
a) you can only like a vid once
I wish Pinkie Pie ran her own bakery! I would never leave!
yes so why tell people when to go vote
b) its something to do with how youtube tracks popular videos
08,01is the sync any better now?
460 million views
holy cow
What is on stream?
misfits
ekips: misfits
hello! what's streaming?
08,01Vash: misfits
well if everyone votes on the same day, id think all it would do is give it most popular of one day, but i dont know how the outube vote thing works
Hi Vash the stampede :3
thanks
I'm not sure if I like what I'm watching yet.
thelonepony its a shame more people don't get the ref
i know
also i hate gangam as much as bieber, so screw that
people have to see trigun
Hi everyone! :)
how are things Stary
Hi Stary :)
hoi Stary
inb4 her nans barely 40
08,01i love Gangnam Style
'ello
08,01the video is absolutely hilarious
08,01the tune is catchy
/me does the gangam style
08,01what's not to love?
Nice to see you again thelonepony :3
:3
I also like it
so what is Misfits about?
twilight_sprinkle, may I commend you on your good taste? :P
lol
Vash: heroes only less pretty
Wait, wheres nathan?
no idea
08,01twilight_sprinkle: so? i didn't say it's the height of high brow entertainment, but it *is* catchy
Lasharus: depends, is that sarcasm?:P
hi everypony :) misfits?
You hate Gangnam Style, I hate Gangnam Style, I approve of your sense of taste. No sarcasm involved, for once. :P
08,01i guess
did they saved the inmortal guy that was buried?
08,01well, each to their own
Lasharus: /) then :D
08,01i like it for what it is
BULLSHIT
What movie/show is this?
08,01but it's nothing more than what it is
aha take on me flashback!
twilight_sprinkle: (\
dafuq
dem not enough budget scenes
I think I had to watch the whole series if I wanted to understand what's going on
How small is the budget?
ekips: Yeah
DerpyMuffins: 100 dollars lol
Any meme stopped being funny about a year before it became a meme.
Even I don't get it >_<
Lasharus: not dolan
Lasharus: not troll face
...wot.
You're trying to argue that trollface is still funny?
it is
08,01twilight_sprinkle: i think that's less to do with the industry, and more to do with the people listening to it. it's always been like that; there have always been simplistic stupid things in vogue
I may have to back out now, before I grab a flamethrower.
The size of a small city.
trollface can be good, but its so horribly over- and mis-used
twilight_sprinkle: Eeyup..
On exceptionally rare occasions, it's used right and amusingly. In practically all others, it's not, and not.
yep trollface is fun http://bwaff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/slenderman-facebook-account.png
twilight_sprinkle, stop echoing me. It's freaky. :P
trolling is fun
ist that the power.dealer?
Lasharus: im in yo head, stealin yo thoughts (ironically, this is a meme:D)
That statement makes me want to slap you cachi01. :P
cachi01: I'm guessing that you troll?
Stary: yep :) but just in facebook and while im playing videogames
People are either idiots or trolls these days. Considering that I feel that trolls are synonymous with idiots, it doesn't really count as a saving grace. Ever.
BRITISH ACCENTS!
cachi01: Heh, I'm sure we all do sometimes :)
eeyup lol
brb eating tacos
I think I prefer to just be a cynical git. It serves me better.
It's why I prefer gaming music in many cases, twilight_sprinkle.
hello everypony!
twilight_sprinkle: same here
Mainstream music, at the risk of sounding like a hipster, is becoming exceptionally bog-standard and boring.
11,01I found that being cynical did nothing but wind me up, make me jump to conclusions, and obtain a borderline personality. Didn't like it.
hi brony2447 :3
Hi brony2447 :3
twilight_sprinkle: I hate pop, ROCK MUSIC FOREVER!
Nittany_Discord, the trick is to be cynical, yet amused by it. :P
ohai Bunny_Striker :3
hello everypony
she can see through other poeple'S eyes now
i myself prefer classical and orchestral stuff mostly, and some individual songs from various genres :P
i just found out there is a brony convention coming to houston! IM SO HAPPEH!!!
that might come in handy
There's no point in being cynical and in a bad mood about everything. That's a recipe for sadness.
Hi God
XD
POLICE SEARCH WARRANT
Dat fail hacking
11,01I think I'll pass on being cynical. I don't want to make any more uninformed opinions.
You've all heard that Season 3 is coming out in November right? :)
That's fair enough Nittany_Discord.
11,01I'm sure those two are mutually exclusive though.
Far be it from me to tell someone how to be.
...
really
I just prefer sarcasm and cynicism. I just try not to annoy people with it, but rather to amuse.
he draws what happens?
Wut?
*shrugs*
so wait, i just turned on stream, but is this right, he draws the future?
HE KNOWS!!!!!
Maybe they like to have those kind of ads? o-o

08,01he's like inverted Isaac Mendez
LAG!
VEVA! LAS VEGAS
hows he inverted?
08,01twilight_sprinkle: what he draws comes true
isaac drew the future too
O_o

Tyranny
also hitlers dead so why are there still nazis?
08,01doctor_whooves127: the jew didn't kill him

ouch
so......ive seen a few episodes.....what exacly is this show about
but how the tech would be next to useless
i actually dreamt of Heroes today
Yep
08,01cowvarkian: on the contrary; there are several things in the phone that could have influenced the war, even if only through inspiring scientists
flutterchu: have you ever seen Heroes
Hang on a sec
oh
they won because having a nokia = world's hardest material
twilight_sprinkle: um......no
thought it might be a default one
Hello everypony!
already the fact that it had was a computer
My app is being word
hi Ponies47
Weird
Howdy Ponies47!
flutterchu: ok well short version is its about people with superpowers
Hi Ponies47 :)
by chinese I mean german
twilight_sprinkle: understandable enough
they would get the knowladge how to built advanced computers fromt hat phone decades before veryone else
Back
or chinese, they still exist
that's one huge advantage in wars
08,01cowvarkian: they could have got integrated circuits from that. just the basics, but enough to be influencial
Is the video/sound sync off for anyone else?
Why didnt the guy just use a gun to kill hitler anyway?
Can we forget the logical flaws and just find the show entertaining?
Its the clones again
oGriofa: logic
oooh........(c) nintendo.......?
and inception again
oGriofa: I don't know why he didnt just kill baby hitle
Eating now, brb
damn you logic, why dont you work in tv shows
*hitler
oGriofa: becasue you cant buy guns at every corner in britain
lol
K
L....ol....
wow thats some serious incompetence
Dark_Horst: he brought a fucking cellphone to the past why not a gun?
Just kill baby hitler, that'll solve all our problems
cachi01: because england
cachi01: probably becasue he ddnt have a guj
gun
Dark_Horst: He was going to go kill hitler, you would think he would just go invest in one in sweden.
cachi01: he robably couldnt get a gun
back, computer crashed
Dark_Horst: he has fucking superpowers he could just go steal a gun from a cop idk
Duh duh duh
so, this is all just going to be a shitty dream sequence, right
also how is there still a resistance
doctor_whooves127: magic
doctor_whooves127: hope
all of the above
Lets just find the show entertaining! XD
dem peelz
wait what about the brainwashy chick?
ALCOHOL YAY
im back
so... hitler getting a cell phone.. lets him when the war... so does he not horribly fail in russia?
wb Brony_Pony26
thanks
and do we not develop atomic bombs?
misfists right
cowvarkian: Why are you bothering to debate the semantics?
It's a TV show.
We didn't use atomic weaponry on Germany.
People in it have super powers
Is that realistic?
fucking murrica government. killing inocent japanese people
1.get cellphone 2. 3. win war/profit
wonderbal
cachi01: indeed that was dumb, but why are you brining it up
twilight_sprinkle: because I sortof brought it up
wouldnt everyone speak german if germany won over.
?
how do i get the adverts of my screen
oGriofa: TELEVISIOOOOOOON
Yes, but it's an English TV show.
oGriofa: we wouldnt understand it thouh
oGriofa: they would, if this had a higeher budget
And we don't all speak German in England.
Brony_Pony26: Adblock. Either that or they'll time out.
11,01Brony_Pony26: Download adblock plus.
maybe it was to much work to inforce language
so if the nazis took over why are is curtis still around
why didnt the german dub made this episode and thats it
or maybe they all are speaking german, but its like the tardis, and we just hear an english accent
good observation
^^
so whats he doing?
is he giving out powers?
twilight_sprinkle: he's taking them
stealing ut
I think
it*
u know what that means.........kill him
FINISH HIM
cowvarkian: why did the nazi guy like it being stolen
For once, an episode of Misfits that I'm not watching an wishing that I could watch.
twilight: look's like we need to bury this book SPIKE!!!1 get my shovel. Fluttershy: *sigh* i borowed iiiiit.......iitt at my hoooouuuse. twilight: god your SO USELESS (THE END)

Brony_Pony26: guy went to the past trying to kill hitler. he failed, he dropped his cellphone hitler got his cellphone and then they won because hitler had a cellphone
For what? Did I barf again?

If the nazis took over, than wouldnt the local fascist party of britian be the ones in charge?
Rex_Mundi: wasn't hitler a socialist, and the italians fascist
lol
Rex_Mundi: no. the one in charge would be the local nazi party
cowvarkian: Hitler was never a socialist
Hiya guys
hitler was a communist!
Whats up?
Rex_Mundi: nazi's are the national socialist party
Agile like a cat, excellent excuse.
seems legit
hai otakon28 :)
13national socialist workers party...
Hi, otakon28. :)
Why are you talking about Hitler?
so the ones in charge would be this guys? http://www.elistmania.com/images/articles/259/Original/The_Nazi_Party.jpg
Hiya Shizuka
otakon28: becasue stream
Shizuka: there we are
Uh huh
The nazi's weren't actually socialist.
what are we watching?
cowvarkian: Cleverly named so in order to get some of the lower class into his party, wasnt really socialist. fascism was most popular with middle-class, not lower class.
otakon28: why do you have a 28 in your name?
13cause this is the internet and because godwins law
What is on stream?
Misfits
otakon28: misfits

Shizuka: figures
"ahem" The Misfits
Shizuka: we've been discussing hitler since the beginning of the episode
actually god dosent win if there is no proof he is real
Yh the 28 means on tablet
so this hitler thing, has it gone on for many episodes or just this one?
well you fucked it up oldman
wow, the jew guy must feel like sh*t after what hes done
this one

Zawan: just this one
Anyway just popping in, brb
I don't understand why he doesn't just go back and time and kill him again.
this is why you should have taken a gun
Brony_Pony26: Don`t talk of my religion, dude
so........is there a main character in this series
Go back to when he was a baby and kill him without a struggle? XD
?
im just saying there is no proof he could but i think he might not atheism dude
five, actually
Brony_Pony26: you have proof it isnt real?
Fascism was really what is called third-way econonomics, neither Socialist nor capitalist. It was a hybred system. A form of state controlled Corporatism,
Brony_Pony26: no? then stfu
Rex_Mundi: mmk
do you have proof he is real
flutterchu: well no, although the nerd is becoming the super guy mainly
yay drawfriend
Brony_Pony26: you have proof it isnt?
Shut up with religion
no
he*
not in this place man
cachi01: loads of it
Brony_Pony26: Do you have proof he isn`t real?
cowvarkian: like what?
Hitler was most likely agnostic, at least he comes off as a vaugly agnostic semi-deist to me.
cowvarkian: and dont bring me that bullshit of evolution
cachi01: I could show you, but then it would violate my beliefs
CUTTING BANANA
go somewhere else if you want to talke about Religion
no but you dont have any proof he is so lets just watch misfits
Nazis!
talk*
thelonepony: Agreed.
cachi01: and no, I'm not being sincere
stream, WHY U LAG
cachi01: youre religious?
cachi01: wait, seriously, bullshit of evolution
Gay lover lol.
hes not to bright
refresh
Sausages?.....Really?
I was waiting for that "gay is evil in Nazi Germany" line.
twilight_sprinkle: religious addict like those crzy guys that say that if they win in cod is because god helped them? no
Suasage muffin.
Those guns didn`t look German
twilight_sprinkle: i just beleave in god thats it
:|
cachi01: evolution isnt bullshit though
cachi01: so, what's with the "evolution is bullshit"
AJIsAwesome: agreed
yep it isnt
AJIsAwesome: we probably should, yeah
idk it seems pretty stupid because. if we come from monkeys. shouldnt our babies be born like monkeys?
someone will save- o
Talk of Religion somewhere else, but here Please
thoose aren seconds
cachi01: no, our genes have changed, our patterns are different
cachi01: you should really learn more about genetics before you talk out of your ass
thats not a german gun, is it?
cachi01: besides, evolution doestn contradict god anyway
Bunny_Striker: the rifles are
just contradicts some bible stuff
twilight_sprinkle: yeah u r right
ITS U
still i find evolution pretty weird lol
STOP TALKING ABOUT GOD! IT PISSES ME THAT FUCK OFF
THE
twilight_sprinkle: bible's just a silly book full of myth anyways
OK LETS STOP
cachi01: put it this way if it was adam and eve alone then we are all inberd and are doing it with our relatives
Yes, lets go back to talking about Hitler
cowvarkian: ye
I thought religious talks were banned from this chat?
Rex_Mundi: lol ok

GilDash: they probably are
GilDash i didnt know that
cowvarkian: I hate you

cachi01: do you find breathing weird too?
yay incompetence
Bunny_Striker: thats cool
Brony_Pony26: same with the evolution. where do all the monkeys come from? there must be the first 2
Religion and politics, I thought. For usually good reasons.
Not too bright........
cachi01: mono cell organisms
Bunny_Striker: may I request a reason for thine hatred
WHAAAAT? Hitler existed? When does this show take place
cachi01: for fuks sake, what did you do during biology class?
you see hitler getting ahold of a future gun would make more sense
Welp
It definately takes place in the 21st century
cowvarkian: you talking about the bible, it pisses me off
if he weremt so incomptenet, they wouldnt have messed this up
no there were multiple apes and multiple other species that grew out of the molecules and atoms and they slowly started to evolve
Bunny_Striker: oh, me saying that it's basicly not all ture
. . . . . . . . . . . . .
*true
I dont need the Bible to belive in God
Open up and say aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
well, its myth and legend
why doesnt He use it

He can only abosrb the power, not use them
Don't do it :(

Howdy otakon!
My Little Nazis: cellphones are magic
Bunny_Striker: you cant really understand time travel, theres no proven knowledge of how it would work
7Despite having said nothing, I'm off.

well that was random
SkiFree!
Yes
I'm going to take off. I'm going to play some PS2.
Dark92Enigma: ive only seen the first season, what dari streamed
Bad news is that even after updating my video driver to the latest version, Planetside is still giving off a G25 error. Meaning that there is probably no chance of this game running on my computer.
Bunny_Striker: i forgot to ask you the last time you were here :$
twilight_sprinkle: oh, OK
sonicdude558: Remember that scary as hell yetti?
yeah
And the other bad news is that AdBlockPlus seems to no longer be working on mips.tv as of my latest restart of Firefox.
I have no idea what a WAD is.
o.o
stream froze for me
Rex_Mundi: also http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_GlrLsumvg

blazefoot: sounded like it would be
blazefoot: Oh no... not that monstrosity. XD
How infinitely horrible!
i want a copy due to the unadulterated ham
>.>
blazefoot: I want to know how many pigs were killed in the making of that comic.

GilDash: a bajillion
i walk in my room and hear EHHHHHH and it scaredthe shit out of me
this game hurts my eyes
lol
it was very hammy and goofy
5000000000000 by the way
cowvarkian: Try a septillion. Real number, too.
GilDash: I know
yes
cowvarkian: 700,000,000?
GilDash: ok then
GilDash, are you a fan of mister lewis "linkara" lovhaug?

oh bollucks
he's awesome
Rex_Mundi: im sure it does
what a complete and utter jerkrocket
/me imagines himself in the night in 1993
And then Doom 3 did it... -_-
do ho ho
I miss the 90s, sooo much.
11,01Yeah. 90s were fun in a way.
As one who played SMB1 when the game was relatively new, I can relate to the newness of that.
same here Rex_Mundi
i was born in 1998 goddamit
Born 1990, the era of N64 and Nicktoons and saturday morning cartoons.
I was born in 97...
cachi01: but your still a 90's kid
96 over here
I still have seen quite a bit of 90's cartoons...
96 here
is it weird that i feel a little old when im only 22?
and 80's
i didnt watch much tv or play many games in the 90s
just imagne if the remade this without the 90s graphics
I saw a crap ton of re runs
Bunny_Striker: doom 3
Bunny_Striker: Someone did a Doom 3 conversion mod that did just that.
oh
Hey guys I'm back
ASoftFluffyThing: I'm sure you are
wb ASoftFluffyThing :3
thelonepony: yeah atleast i could play my ps1 when i was 2 years old
ASoftFluffyThing: NOW GET OUT! JK
I go to Jobcorp, and the place is filled with teanagers who dont get the references i make or remember the things i do.
cowvarkian, thelonepony, Bunny_Striker lool *hugs*
Also
no strafing seems pretty annoying though
cachi01: i never had a ps1, instead i had a N64
im sorry but that guys face at the bottom is creeping me the hell out :D
Rex_Mundi: thats fun
/me scoots over to Nittany_Discord and fluffs
Rex_Mundi: I probably would atleast get half of them
twilight_sprinkle: You can strafe though...
thelonepony: every morning i asked my parents to buy me a n64...
oh ok
11,01Thanks for fluffing me.
thelonepony: i just bought it 2 years ago :/
You're welcome, Nitt ^^
Rex_Mundi: but then again, I spent most of my days watching cartoons and movies
my roomates never saw groundhog day, the classic Bill murrey movie
and playing video games
well it's still fun having cachi01 :3
Rex_Mundi: he must die
one*
thelonepony: yeah lol
Rex_Mundi: I've seen it like, 3 times in the past 6 months
twilight_sprinkle: In fact, running diagonally would produce a bug due to pythagoras and stuff, so you would go at about 1.3 times the normal speed.
thelonepony: i asked for n64. i got gamecube. i asked for n64 i got ps2 :D
:D
I think im the only brony there, except one guy who i dont like
Rex_Mundi: thats fun
me
a brony in bronystate?
dafuq
cachi01: he means at the job corp thing
whats a brony >_>
Nah. Nothing bad ever happens when you pick up a level-specific item.
i want a brownie!
GilDash: lol i guess they just made the x and y speeds add
blazefoot: me too :3
i call dibs
I have some brownies...
Doom guy vs Master Chief
cowvarkian: oh lol
GilDash: yes it FUCKING DOES
I remember when The Mummy, was a new movie
Bunny_Striker: doom guy
mmm, brownies, haven't had those in awhile <3
Bunny_Striker: doom guy wins in less than a second
cowvarkian: does it have... you know >_>
thelonepony: heh, no
oh :(
diediediediediediediediediediediedie
Rex_Mundi: I remember not knowing it wasnt a new movie
twilight_sprinkle: Basically. Doom doesn't actually have hight co-ordinates either, so shooting at something close on the x-axis but far on the y-axis gives the illusion of the projectile travelling really fast.
because I was like, 6
GilDash: yah i noticed that lol
cachi01: Master Chief won, check out Death battles. Master Chief has supior armor and weapons and more agile
IMPOSSIBRU
BUT ACCORDING TO DEATH BATTLES
Yeah, but can't Doomguy run at like 60mph?
STARSCREAM WINS AGAINST RAINBOW DASH
cachi01: why are we trusting the internet to be a nerd for us
no
cachi01: how Rainbow Dash won
I think older games are in some ways more immersive that new games. for some reason, Resident evil 2 has this immersion that RE1 remake, with its awesome graphics, doesnt have as much of.
false my good cachi
wait rainbow dash won?
Viewing Musical Photos of Mewtwo on Pokemon Black.
Oh god...
dash won
cachi01: yup
I think I'm gonna die
Bunny_Striker: she ate his spark

ii laughed SOOOOO HARD XD
Jerkrocket XD
cowvarkian: ikr?
im not sure if i can post this?
i mean, theres no nudity

So, do you guys consider old school pony fans who happen to like G4 as well, Bronies?
YES
Rex_Mundi: one might think that
yes
well bronies are FANS of mlp
fim
Rex_Mundi sure, they like ponies, we like ponies
:O
a brony is a fan of MLP:FIM
if u liek G4 u r a brony
if not
well u are not
Yeah, but they have been liking ponies for a long tme, and then we pop up and they are suddenly bronies now
I ONLY like g4 I hate all the other ones
Rex_Mundi: yes if they like g4 they are bronies
well, veteran fans would be a fitting term
^
cachi01: I like the old ones, mostly
Really? i cant stand the old ones
never heard of mlp until the teens reacted to it, lol
they're really not that bad
G1 is alright, especially the piolts/TV specials.
Bunny_Striker: oh god im so sorry
Some one failed at making a bronies shirt http://blu.stb.s-msn.com/i/A6/CDD278C5709A72A8B589CF55DCA48D_h231_w308_m4_cUmvaAVjx.jpg
mostly G1 and G2, honestly
cachi01: ?
G3 is just fun to make fun of
sparkarez: u had one job walmart
ONE FUCKING JOB
sparkarez: I dont even
Bunny_Striker: im sorry u had to watch those idiots reacting to the intro and not the series
A fun thing about that shirt is that the G1 ponies are all wrong too, that shirt fails in every way
but they tried their best 3:
sparkarez, what are you talking about that's the best shirt I've seen
sparkarez: Oh god no
cachi01: oh
wut game is this?
doom
Doom !
walmart is just clueless about what generation the bronies are fans of
walmart is just clueless of everything
reminds me of the 90s
NewSuperBronyU: minecraft wrecked my dl
Sleepies*
I became a brony after watching Saberspaker`s "Ballad of the Brony(remastered)
me too
ooh yeah dat documentary lol its a good documentary
I became a brony after I saw "Party Of One" on T.V.
The tv
T
CrimsonPhoenix: ikr? A shirt, with the words "I <3 Bronies", but with G1 ponies, that are all miscolored or diddnt even exist in G1. its epic. The Iron Maiden font used for "Bronies" just makes it better.:)
i saw a forum thread on gaia
i became a brony after watching the MOVS cupcakes and how vegeta became a brony
that scene of the piano falling in twilight made me a brony
Rex_Mundi, totally
i became a brony after i saw some rainbow dash vids
i love dat scene
cachi01: I became a brony after one of my friends pestered me into watching the show on youtube
i became a brony after seeing this shirt in Walmart...
lol

scout19_tf2: u know. THE shirt
Nittany_Discord drives a hard bargain.

Crakle :3
cachi01: I saw one episode on youtube, and then watched every one that was on it at one time...
pony5807, no advertisement
I can't decide whether my favorite is Rainbow Dash or Twilight
11,02JRP: I'm sorry :(
sparkarez: spike is best pony
pony5807 it appears non-members cannot see the content that is in the link
sparkarez, you're favortie is Rarity
cowvarkian: i checked my tv for my little pony and sadly. its on discovery kids but they were repeating the first episodes so i watched mlp from the first episode

NewSuperBronyU: fix my sleepies

I actually first found out about it on the Bioware forums, there was a "which pony is best pony" poll
party of one was my first ep
11,02JRP: Go sleepies D:
and season 2 airs on december here in mexico
cachi01: thats silly
i cant remember if december 3 or november 3
party of 1 reminds me of the cupcakes fanfic
cachi01: but thats why you have the internet
eeyup
You think it will be like Transformers. When g5 comes around, many G4 fans will be like "G4 is the only good gen", and G5 fans will be like "G5 is better than FIM"
also, brb
Rex_Mundi: I'll probably like G5, but fuck if I know
Rex_Mundi that like with every fandom with generations
something tells me g5 will be crap
My only fear is if MLP FIm loses it's popularity
we don't even know if G5 will have a show
CrimsonPhoenix: it is inevitable o.o
im back wuts goin on
http://bronies.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=rbd&action=display&thread=68
p4ngya, almost inevitable
G5 might not even come in the next 10-20 years, who knows?
let's not forget that MLP is a TOYLINE
hey guys, what key do you press to make typing put the letters between letters and not replacing the one in fron, i must have accidentally pressed something and its anoying.
so the TOYS comes first then it's the shows
eeyup december 3

Still, AJIsAwesome , everypony loves you.
Plus, there are much other people who are known here. :)

HOSTAGE SITUATION
Dken2021: precisely
368 POINTS IN WOLFPUNCHER BEAT THAT BRONYSTATE!
wolfpuncher?
It's been too long since I've last seen it. And it seems to have aged better than I could have expected.
*starts a small buisness with thelonepony* selling cabages to Earth Kingdom villagers*
Seen this.
Silver_Spoon: Or, perhaps, he follows a set list of lines and acts that are written down on a piece of paper or booklet, sometimes known as a script?
kill the hostages. then he won't have leverage
man its only 8:34 and yet it feels like 10 o'clock
GigabitHarmonie: Even better :3 Imma steal that
We don't have sitcoms like these anymore...
this the best cop ever
Quick_Thinker: i hate that
he just wants to kill people
WHY DO YOU HATE TAHT
THIS IS AWESOME
I predict he will never get her name right.
Rex_Mundi: who's gonna run this bitch, Me or you?
me
VenHur yea, Tyler perry tried but....ya know.....
:D
RDash5000, hostages have a higher priority than the cops in this situation. And the perpetrator has lowest priority.
Dken2021: Tyler Perry failed hard.
okay Boss Thinker
VenHur: But Eurkle took over this show, it practicly became his show with the rest of the family supporting minor characters.
gun person... so hes a smith
Kandarihu: it was just a joke...
thelonepony:I vote for Kandarihu, hes got buisness acumen.

hello everyone

Quick_Thinker: if it doesn't show nudity( in only one episode)
hi flutterchu
High school of the dead breaks the rules of being a good anime
Hi flutterchu
warning wolfsplosion, wolfsplosion!
nah, imo, it would count as borderline fanservice
thelonepony: but that's happened before, and... yeah
at least in later episode
s
asdfghjkl;'
you have to refresh the page to replay :D
high school of the dead is best fanservice anime
so...is there stream or am i just buffering
flutterchu: someone was looking for you
i tried watching bleach, i didnt get into it
BTW if u see CCM in wolfpuncher boards thats me
Ev'ry day we're buffering

Well if there's no stream, fine
you guys gonna stream walking dead?
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, but it really is over hyped and formulaic. No good character ever dies, ever. Its just DBZ fights with less tension. The villain is made of plastic and has no personality or faults or real motivation. The redeaming qualities of the show is the animation and characters.

1. Throw something at cleverbot
2. Let things escalated quickly
3. ???

Man, I miss those oldschool Japan RPGs. Would be awesome if they would release those old PSOne games on Steam or something
guys should i get amnesia or should i just download a torrent?
cachi01: neither, waste of money
and monet
IMPOSSIBRU
count de monet
amnesia you get free maps and stuff...
amnesia is awesome!
cachi01, you mean are you asking if you should buy Amnesia or torrent it?
Kandarihu: yep
Kandarihu: yar har or not yar har?
cachi01: depends on your financial condition and pc
cachi01: just give us your credit card number,pin, and password and we'll tell you what to do!
twilight_sprinkle: well i think i could perfectly buy it.....and i get my new pc next month.
twilight_sprinkle: :D
Well, I'm up to the 4th episode of Macross Frontier, but since I watched Macross 7, the sight of Battle Frontier is just a foregone conclusion instead of a spoiler.
cachi01: well if you can easily afford it, then buy it i guess
But if that thing is called something other than Battle Frontier, that would be a spoiler to me.
so why are we watching giant robots, and not rifftrax, or is shizuka still playing MvM
yeah i guess i will buy it
13val will go before me
Shizuka: >.> okay
orange base http://i390.photobucket.com/albums/oo345/stryke81/music_pony_wallpaper_by_yikomega-d47d1yg.jpg
hiya Shizuka
Shizuka: I accept this as truth
13ohai
ValtheJean: so how you been man?
Man, the dogfights in Macross Plus, Zero, and Frontier are so amazingly visceral.
2,14 best not to ask
Shizuka do you want a copy of The ship ?
ValtheJean: what if we do ask
ValtheJean: okay well that sucks to hear still hello and good to see you
13the ship?
cowvarkian: leave him be about it
I meant I don't know how I'm gonna do the yellowish orange base anypony HELP ME very much Appreciated (P.M. me if you know how i should do the picture)
otakon: I know, just was being a dick about it
got a copy for free and when activated it gave me 2 copies to gift
also each of those will give another copy to gift
cowvarkian: there is no reason to be a dick about something
otakon: ok
okay is my chat busted or something?
Nope.

lol wat big o?
okay just wonder
BIG O!

I like the Big O :|
LadyCanary: your fangirl is showing again :3
well stahp, noone wants to hear it. None of it really needs to be said.
LadyCanary: Big O is awesome
and big o is jsut punch the crap out of it
oGriofa: bah, humbug
13hm..

13think i will pass
big o had the most unsatisfying ending
13danke though~
it worked but was really.. meh
:p k
13doesn't look like quite my thing :3
agreed
it also hasa great song opening
it was like the ME3 ending
taoumi: tell me something that has had a satisfying ending
cowvarkian: Gurren Lagann
euerka seven
cowvarkian: cowboy bebop
Sweet.
hey
Gundam WIng
otakon: fine you beat me
G Fighter Gundam
:D
FLCL
otakon: Gurren lagann better
Shall I go on?
going for the new record?
IS THAT ALL YOU DAMN KICK BOTS?
GRRRRRR
otakon: though, I probably would find all those endings silly and cliched, but no, you dont need to go on
simon the digger <3
ohhh well i'll keep looking someone who wants it :3
cowvarkian: ALL endings are cliche, and FLCL's was NOT silly in any case...well no more than the rest of the show
super mario world 2 cowvarkian :3
Phase4 do you want a copy of the ship ?
taoumi: hmm
besides GL did NOT have a cliche ending
not by a long shot
00,02?
*troll face*
INB4: TheGreatAndPowerfulT ends up asking everyone
MOKUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
/me licks taoumi s nose
otakon: yeah right, flcl not having a silly ending
hallo there Bronysith *hugs*
GL is meh
Ponies47 you want one ? i have two
cowvarkian: no sillier than the rest of the show
00,02oh THAT game, seen that before
/me drills twilight_sprinkle in the nose
twilight_sprinkle: what is your reasong that GL is meh?
What's the game about?
otakon: doesnt mean it wasnt silly
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ^
ValtheJean: the hell was that...thing that popped up?
otakon: but yeah
OMG NOOOOO not the Eureka seveN movie
scroll a little there is a steam link in chat
it was terible
otakon: he doesnt enjoy good anime
I
otakon: well from what i saw, i was mediocre story and cahracters and lotsa fanservice
2,14 in the movie, the Nirvash has a....thing
twilight_sprinkle: how far did you get?
FANSERVICE FTW
and the nirvash never got homeinglazors
Phase4 yep, want it ?
ValtheJean: penis?
ValtheJean: it really isn't explained is it?
2,14 the movie sucks ass
otakon: whatever was shown, several eps i think
lol
Bronysith: who me?
twilight_sprinkle: better than just being a deathnote ripoff like code geass
Bronysith: code geass is really nthing like death note
I'll somewhat agree with twilight_sprinkle, TTGL was interesting at first, but...wouldn't really watrch it twice
BIG O
yes ValtheJean you are correct. the movie did indead suck ass. season 2 is turning out ok though
ACTION
00,10needs more dakka
Sumica \:3/
twilight_sprinkle: highly intelligent males with the power to make people do whatever he wants, including having people kill themselves or doing something to his will
needs more desu
ValtheJean: two different shows mang
2,14 also, there is no season 2 of Eureka 7
ValtheJean: lol aren't they making one though?
wait, Big O has 'Hit & Away'?
2,14 they are, but its with different characters
seems odd for a Super Melee type to have H&A
yes there is ValtheJean wou lyou like a link?
otakon: im not a fan of purely hotblooded anime
ledouche........lol
2,14 otakon, it's pilot ability

just for you ValtheJean http://anilinkz.com/series/eureka-seven-ao

00,02to be fair, i'm doing something where you could actually justify the behaviour as 'this is what you get for doing weird stuff' but still
the hell robot was that from?
seriously is JUMPED on him and killed him
2,14 no links during a stream
it's not a viedo link ValtheJean

Ah :P
00,03Animated movie! With Freddie Prinze Jr. as Vega!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-o735CSPD4&feature=plcp
Odd, but it could work
Scoot-Scootaloo: who animated it?
I dont know Giga or Alleg, so i dont know if it fits them or not
Scoot-Scootaloo, you are refering to the one in SD no?
http://fav.me/d4r821l
No video links during stream. :)
Is it common for people to only go on one stream? I only go on this one.
You have never seen them stream?
dayum, AJ as paladin
00,03I mean Paragon Lost, I beleive it takes place before ME3
I....uh.....leave the stream when they come on...
:\
Muffin Mancer is best class by the way
Oh
Scoot-Scootaloo: it takes place during ME2 I think.
Im too crazy about them. But im glad everyone else is, lol.
CrimsonPhoenix: Muffinmancer...I can dig it
00,03Vega was a BAWSE in it~
oGriofa: this IS the only one

Scoot-Scootaloo: really? you found it enjoyable?
11,01I think we can safely assume at least Allegr0 is male.
sonicdude558: dude you sound tired, get some sleep man
00,03It was cliche as hell, but a surprise ending!
sonicdude558: please cut out that bullshit.
nah
11,01I think they both are guys though.
2,14 sonicdude558, we get it. You don't like the stream. You're being INCREDIBLY rude

They are
Its not the stream
11,01But OC gender isn't a big deal.

RAWRity: the comic books are still better
2012
oGriofa WHAT ANNOUNCEMENT
cowvarkian: congratulations. I give not even a single fuck.
This was my first internet chat thingy. So i made sure to read the rules first thing :D
RAWRity: I couldnt give a fuck that you culdnt give a fuck
well someone is in a bigger mood than usual
*couldnt
It was for me to\
*Couldn't
RAWRity: you okay man?
apostrophes are important
It was only a temp ban but still
RAWRity: I know
Yeah :P
damn
RAWRity: I just assume that people are smart enough to know what the fuck I'm trying to say
Ive been kicked quite a few times tho. None of them were for a legit reason tho :D
Head Vulcan did that kind of damage?
/me Will never forget when he got the ban hammer
May 20, 2012
2,14 fully upgraded*
cmon guys no fighting
oh nice
Dang :o
ValtheJean: he looks the same
FINISH HIM OFF!
FIHGT FIGHT i meaan...
otakon: fine. Just heard "The book is better" or "The comics are better" or "the short story is better" that it's become a meaningless phrase to me.
How do I remeber?
RAWRity: cool story bro
O.o
That was the same day I made the Ponies47 Youtube channel
It adds nothing to the conversation other than saying that the speaker is familiar with some other form of the story.
Somehow, saying "the book was better than the movie" is pretty hipster.
RAWRity: oh since it seems to be bandied around so much when comparing one adaptation to another?
Oh, lol
RAWRity: yes, the better version
otakon: more or less, yes.
RAWRity cowvarkian u guys might want to use this image.. http://iambrony.steeph.tp-radio.de/mlp/gif/162402%20-%20animated%20fluttershy%20image_macro%20Look_At_All_The_Fucks_I_Give%20macro.gif
RAWRity: but were you going to say something else?
or at least the original version of it
I was son young and stupid when it happened
cachi01: LOOK AT THEM LOOK AT ALL OF THEM
I was still pretty new to the chatting thing
Heh
RAWRity: ;___; W-What happened to DC nation....
LadyCanary: hmm?
I remember when i first came here. No one noticed me at all :D
I haven't seen Young Justice yet
I felt so left out
Neither have I
RAWRity: tis good
had it DVR'd but mom's been hogging the TV all weekend.
But I heard something happened to DC Nation
I didn't tell anyone I was new until later that night
00,10buy ereything
LOL ==========> YOUNG JUSTICE <======= LOL
RAWRity: I just torrented young justice a few days ago, its pretty good
cachi01: what
I remeber Scoots was the first mod to talk to me
I joined after an anime marathon thing was shown... im so mad that i missed it :D
Sooo many of my fav movies shown that week
It's a shame I can remeber stuff like this but stuff I need to remeber for tests on such ._.
RAWRity: yeah, I know
:<
LOL =========> POINTLESS ARGUMENT <============ LOL
I just lost all sense of reality..
Meh
*but not
Thats life :I
remember the bad. Throw the stuff you need out the window :D
LOL ==========> REALITY <========== LOL
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-5492.html this new person was apparently born in 2004
the young justice tv show is actually more similar to the teen titans comic books, and the teen titans tv series is more similar to the young justice comic books...
just saiyan
that makes me feel really old ._.
BOSS BOROT!
is gonna TEAR SOME SHIT UP!
13http://i.imgur.com/3jf6u.jpg
Hehe
Shizuka: hmm
Shizuka: so wrong but dammit why am I chuckling then
otakon: because youre a horrible person
?
*you're
hmm, aparently DC nation's been put on hiatus until January
Wow, 10 damage. :D
cowvarkian: hey I love the Harry Potter series and it's character's they have a special place in my heart.
shizuka i linked that pic yesterday but in spanish i couldnt find it in english, did you translated it?
Woops comp crashed
RAWRity: damn what? that sucks just when YJ was just getting good
someone born in 2004 is old enough to use the internet
TWI IS MAD! THROW THE TWI!
otakon: I meant mostly the laughing part, and the fact that kids... bah whatever
I can't install Forge
Dang
no official reason as to why, though some speculate that it's to make room for the retro programs that they're airing as part of the 20th anniversary
dammit Boss FIGHT BACK!
Oh, and is that you on your DA, Ponies? With the 'watched mlp' caption on it?
woah
I still need to get back into Young Justice. Ever since the hiatus I pretty much forgot about it.
i saw this playthrough of a GREAT tutorial of how to play the legend of zelda blind
LITERALLY BLIND
however, the latest Young Justice episode's available for download through iTunes
AJIsAwesome: there was a time shift
nice
REINFORCEMENTS!
of both kinds
crap
flutterchu step 1 cover your eyes. step 2 ????????? step 3 profit?
I don't know, muffins?
RAWRity: hmm
*still blushing*
RAWRity: im surprised that val hasnt yelled at you yet
What?
okay what the HELL is going on here ValtheJean is everyone just kind of feeling this at the same time or something?
flutterchu: maybe they say that just for credit :D
2,14 yes, running a stream can be a bit of a preoccupance
since I know that Z deals with multiple dimensions and all...I think
The first picture on your DA
otakon watchu talkin bout willis?
ValtheJean: I see that
2,14 but seriously, is it so bad that I tried to trust the chat?
2,14 unfortunately, that
s a laughable statement
wait what
superretroworld: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmmqarQRSSE
2,14 stop with the non-image links
No. That's Denis Leary :D
at least ive been a good boy..
lol
nekkid
flutterchu: dude
ValtheJean indeed it is quite funny
And yes he spells Denis with only one n
Oh, who is that? :D
2,14 seriously, it's the most basic rule out there
flutterchu: SHAME ON YOU
okay :'(
Welp, Im off to bed. Goodnight all! <3
night LadyCanary
Night, LadyCanary. :)
Night LadyCanary :)
Have a great day/night all <3 and thanks Val.
night ladycanary )
Blow up ALL THE MECHS
night LadyCanary
ValtheJean: at this point why not for simplicity just say no links whatsoever during a stream? It'd be easier to deal with it seems.
confound my non working tab
Comedian, actor, he even wrote a book or 2
night LadyCanary sleep well.
i finnaly found the place where i can watch mlp movies :D
flutterchu: maybe hes secretly looking on his left eye
2,14 yes it would, but image links are a tradition of ours
hello everypony
lol I'm gonna get my mom to play portal. I wonder how bad she's gonna do :p
hey
hello
hi The_Awesomeness
hello The_Awesomeness
Well pictures aren't as distracting
hows it going
youtube is a flat out insult
why
Hi, The_Awesomeness. :)
thats not true
it shows how much you don't care for the streams and encourage other people to do so
Posting them publicly during a stream, it is.
ValtheJean: yeah but for cripe's sake everytime someone posts a non image link that ISN'T a video you guys start waving your various ban weapons about.
haha, I got my mom to play New Super Mario Bros once
guys today i found a cat thats about 1 year old and looked like hed been lost for months
She didn't understand that you can't just run into the enemies
Ah, i see :o
otakon: I really only see val do it
it was pretty funny
otakon: because their ban weapons are always freshley polished and shiny.
The_Awesomeness, are you going to adopt it?
oGriofa: love that shiny trident
2,14 we treat videos the same damn way otakon. If you've witnessed otherwise it's because I'm trying to manage a stream, 3 chats and many other things
He's hilarious! :D
its kinda funny really we were driving by and this cat just crosses by us at a stopsign so i just get out and pick it up
that sounds very stressing
I look nothing like him :P
its hair was all matted down and it was really thin
The_Awesomeness, are you going to adopt it?
i guess
3 chats?
ValtheJean: no no, don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's a bad thing just suggesting it would be easier to say no lings at all so you don't have to tell someone "no [link]" every time is all. I wasn't trying to be confrontational about it just saying.
00,10I restart and things get intersting I see
have you taken the cat the vet The_Awesomeness ?
indeed Sumica
Sumica: you could say that
Sumica: boredom is a dangerous thing
IS that bitching i hear? AGAIN?
Sumica: I guess so.
oGriofa: where have you been
Sumica: I'm suggesting that you guys just ban links altogether during streams for simplicities sake.
i would but its sunday
otakon: fuck that
so the vets closed
cowvarkian: i just read the stuff.
00,10many would like to do that
Now I'm not saying I would
what is this dusk dawn fan episode??????????????
The_Awesomeness: congrats to your new pet
otakon, may I add that people will STILL post link beside that
The_Awesomeness: well try to get the cat to the vet tomorrow as soon as possible
ded
My mom was having trouble looking at the painting on the wall haha
but it seems to be a problem and I think that would be the easiest way to solve the issue
cachi01: Fan made episode of a fanfic, I think.
flutterchu got told 100 times now about no video links
oh
CrimsonPhoenix: I've posted site links here, and only got told not to once...
otakon: ban links?!
cachi01: it's sadly a lacking full length fan ep... needs a lot of work.
me/ kicks otakon
I posted the site links like, 5 times
otakon: Agreed.
2,14 thank you for admitting to breaking the rules cowvarikian
so... yeah
i cut the cats matted hair out and gave it small amounts of canned cat food frequently as intructed by the internet
oh hey gameloft is doing a MLP SIM
ugh
gameloft?
ugh
Dask's dawn is an abomination
ValtheJean: I didn't know I was breaking the rules until you told me I was at one time
2,14 rather than gloat about getting away with it, why not realize that sometimes things get missed
Dusk's Dawn**
SIM?
Oh god.
i mean
you are twilight sparkle
No, just no.
Twilight Sparkle just evolved
but i dont know if the cat will survive its pretty thin and might have a disease, plus it already has diarhea
and u build ur own ponyville
i'm back!
Lets just let the link thing go guise.
oGriofa: I'm fine with this
Sorry, went on a DA clicking rampage :D
Someone will hack it for Rule 34.
see i'm w/ otakon here. it's rather confuseing what constatues a 'ok' link. becasuse some images have as much text a a normal site. so it gets rather grey
soooo lets just see how the game ends
I just know it
Done watching TNA Bound for Glory.....it was awesome
The_Awesomeness, check it with a veterinarian?
and apparently its coming to the app store SOON
Ah
cachi01: everyone dies
Looking at all the lovely pony artwork i will never be able to do :FD
Oh god
*:D
and everyone lies
Why
XD
Im so jealous of JJ's work :'(
Talk about awesome artwork!
CrimsonPhoenix: Not an abomination, just a bad attempt. The VA was bad, the story seemed weak, plus various other things. Is it an unholy abomination that should burn eternally in a volcano? No, of course not. Does it need work? YES, and LOTS of it. I'd still give it a chance if they remade it or fixed a LOT of things.
Ah
guys do you think society has progressed soically in any mahor way scince its begining other than science and technollogy
well to be fair first person games are pretty confusing
for me at least
:P
The_Awesomeness: yes
Otherwise, I don't hate it.
how
The_Awesomeness: arts?
The_Awesomeness: culture?
hows that improved
00,10emo seed
The_Awesomeness: good question
Sumica: ikr
Also, welcome back, Dark92Enigma. :)
AJIsAwesome, You're saying they should change the whole thing for you to like it.
Dat EQD bot
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350269202646.jpg
The_Awesomeness: are you seriously asking how much humanity has improved since we became humans?
anchents had culture and arts its not like its become something greater than it was back when engineers bult the pyrimids
I respect their ambition and patience on the project
The_Awesomeness: since its creation id say yes, but relative to science in terms of importance and overall progress, id say no
AJIsAwesome: i'll be here for a very short time.....because i'm just done watching a PPV
CrimsonPhoenix: So do I. I'm just stating problems in the episode.
The_Awesomeness: we developed societies, we built cities, walls, and other fucking fantastic shit
00,10only problem was CrimsonPhoenix, they said they rushed the project
but really it felt like they just wanted the title of the very first fan-made episode
and that
I cannot accept
The_Awesomeness: do you not count literature as well?
im talking about anything but science i mean culturally do you think humans have improved as peaople?
CrimsonPhoenix: What ep----OH DOUBLE RAINBOOM? NO SPOILERS FOR ME, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!
The_Awesomeness: yes
I do
how
00,10no Dark92Enigma
Dark92Enigma, Dusk's Dawn
2,14 fanmade episodes are an abomination, and we shouldn't be embracing them so wholeheartedly as a community
Dark92Enigma: The Dusk's Dawn episode.
ValtheJean: cool story
how have we improved
I'm skeptically looking forward to Double rainboom
00,10ValtheJean, on the whole people are not
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh, Dusk Dawn and not MLP FIM
ValtheJean: Why the heck not? Fan made stuff is awesome.
2,14 then some faith in the fandom restored
The_Awesomeness: I honestly can't explain it, I just know we have
The_Awesomeness: well its hard to say since we can only mopstly judge from our own lifespan, but id say no
Its one thing to make a fan-made episode, its another to make one with OCs and a COMPLETELY revamped style and storyline
good morning everypony
Did you know that a fanfic writer in the fandom recently got a novel published?
The_Awesomeness: not much at least
2,14 because it's an insult to the show's creators in exchange for self-service
hoi Maid_RainBow
00,10especaly seeing as the "first" fan ep was rushed and it shows
Hi, Maid_RainBow.
Hi Maid_RainBow :)
anchent societies have acheived and surpassed our level of social equallity many times
pinkie pie is best 133t HAX0R
I wouldn't say it'll be the best thing ever but if Double Rainboom will be decent
https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/pinkiepie-strikes-again-compromises-google-chrome-pwnium-contest-hack-box-101012
they said double rainboom was gonna be the first fan made episode........
flutterchu: WELL NOPE
00,10heheh you bumpd the home button ValtheJean
twilight!
so, looking at "Dusk's Dawn" the first 10 seconds make me think that this was animated by old-school South Park animators.
we need more Dr. Who knock off episodes
00,03Giggity~
you dont belong up there!
WATCH OUT!
RAWRity: lol
I really cannot accept Dusk's Dawn as a whole. As what it is meant to be and what it wanted to do
00,03So yeah, more pics coming tomorrow!
Double Rainboom is going to seem like its not even made by fans
00,031So yeah, more pics coming tomorrow!
Dusk Dawn, is this a fanmade episode of FiM? Or something else?
00,03Freaking computer..
it's not the first fan-made episode of MLP:FiM
it would be funny if double rainboom sucked
00,03Night y'all!
night Scoot-Scootaloo :)
Night Scoot-Scootaloo :)
Night, Scoot-Scootaloo.
its not like we've made some revolutionary change to the human condition scince its begining. i mean sure we have all this technollogy but have we improved as a people have we changed?
00,10best review of Dusk dawn that I have seen compared it to "the room"
oh twilight, youre not a gundam :3
Kandarihu: it's what happens when somebody takes 6 OC's and tries to make an episode of FiM
cachi01: only i've seen the WIP at bronycon, and so far, its as if the fans had complete assistance from the animators, only they actually didnt
Meow :3
good lord
There's pre-youtube Flash Animations made with better animation than this.
cachi01: the trick to a good story is planning EVERY detail out beforehand. Im fully confident they did so
Hi, Ponies47. :3
why is eureka seven in here as well?
"Ultimate Battle of Ultimate Destiny" moved more fluidly than this stilted pile of puke
Hi Ponies47 :3
i thought this was gundamn.
The_Awesomeness, we humans are fundamentally imperfect beings. The darkest ages in our modern era have happened when people have tried to deny that.
Hi AJIsAwesome thelonepony :3
i dont understand!
ValtheJean! explain this!
>.>
AJIsAwesome, seriously I really wish Dusk's Dawn didn't exist or at least did not claimed to be the first fan-made episode
why is eureka 7 in this gundam game?
00,10it's Super robot wars Lyra`
oh.
Kandarihu: one would hope we would at least have gotten better, but that doesnt seem to be the case
OH GOD NOW THEY'RE TALKING
>.<
Caramel did you ever had one that got stuck on 1 HP?
2,14 Explain what? Then I'd have to explain why so many other animes are in it
i guesse Double Rainboom will be "the first Fanmade episode not starred by OC's"
CrimsonPhoenix: I can understand that.
00,10it's mechs from many anime
im never on why youre on babe'
This is worse voice acting than spanish Fluttershy
Here's kudos for the Dusk's Dawn team for getting out and doing something. The Level of Quality was clearly not up to snuff though. If that's because they specifically rushed it, then shame on them. If it's because they were learning, then hopefully they'll do better next time.
*while
RAWRity: this is voice acting?
NullRadix: Completely agree
BRB shower
NullRadix: Agreed.
Although I can see Val's point about it being insulting to the shows real animators
NullRadix, but again the fact that they claimed to be the first fanmade episode makes me sick
but that goes for Fan episodes in general
val can read mandarin?
It's not so much insulting as it is kind of pitiable that they though this would hold up to snuff.
that looks like a mix of japanese and chinese
i dont even.
CrimsonPhoenix: I suppose that's a point, it's not a FiM episode, it doesn't use FiM characters
Like I said, its one thing to make a fan made episode, its another to make one with OCs and a revamped storyline and style, while keeping the concept constant
Like, I'd watch Mysterious Mare-Do-Well on repeat for a week before watching this thing more than once.
therefore it's just "in the style of FiM"
NullRadix, and yet they claimed to be first
Lyra`: you do know that there are THREE Japanes alphabets right?
http://i.imgur.com/IC63D.jpg
while Double Rainboom project was announced far before that
i dont
Lyra`, i think he is just going with the flow.
New Born Cuties had better animation than this.
Seriously why fight a giant robot with another giant robot? JUST SEND IN THE OLD YAKUZA GANG!
CrimsonPhoenix: they are the first to release a full version
i dont think you can post that Brad__
thast borderline bondage pony play
Lyra`, oops sorry.
twilight_sprinkle, we used to be better people. We've gotten worse over the past decade.
AHHH! i see what yo did there XD
Brad__: THAT is NSFW
Double Rainboom may take another year or so before its done
pony play :3
Brad__: wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut .-.
otakon, is it?
XD
CrimsonPhoenix: of their work
Kandarihu: what are you prattling on about now?
/me rofl
Brad__: yeah would you post that at work? if no then it's NSFW.
its fine
which can't be titled a fan-made episode
he said sorry :3'
Kandarihu: that could be, although its hard to say how it was before without actually being there. but yeah, we certainly havent made any progress on that matter
otakon, i think Sumica or SB posted that pic a couple weeks ago...
Different channels have different definition of NSFW, so I didn't know sorry.
twilight_sprinkle: okay, what are you both prattling on about now?
well, i forgive you Brad__ :3
Kandarihu: nah, hes always the agressor, dont worry about it
Lyra`, thx :P
00,10I most certenly did not
but i laughed XD
pony play~
twilight_sprinkle, no. I'm always the aggressor.
Brad__: wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut .-.
Brad__: whyyyyyyyyyy .-.
Oh... maybe it was SB who showed me xD
Brad__: well next time if you're not sure if it's NSFW PM the link to a mod and ask if you can post it or not
Kandarihu: Nu >:I
00,10where I dont see any thing exactly wrong with that image it's certenly disterbing
2,14 protip:
cachi01, I don't know! someone linked me on a different channel and I thought it was strange enough to warrant sharing
panda2: yeah PMing you something and posting it in commons is different
Sumica: agreed
2,14 if you're having trouble deciding if it's NSFW, chances are it is
protip: val weilds the ban hammer like he gets a quarter for every time he uses it :D
00,10but seeing as you join and imeadatly post it I am sure you were just fishing for reactions and looking to start shit Brad__
considering some of the awful cosplays I've posted on here, that thing's rather tame.
Lyra`: no no, he has the ban TRIDENT remember?
oh yeah
dari has the ban hammer :3
Sumica, I wasn't trying to offend, just thought it was kind of WTF so thought others might get a kick out of it.
otakon: well he did until I stole it.
2,14 only towards you Lyra`, and that's only because you break rules as if someone promised you candy for it
lol
We're so eager to claim the shame ROFL
brb
otakon it was in the chat >.>
/me hides the candy
who told you about my candy deal?
lol
wait, we get candy for breaking rules?
Lyra`: what? no muffins?
Wrek give candybars for rule-breakers... they also come with a tase in the bum though
oh yeah nullradix, so advertise #Bronystate in #bronystate all you like
/me -_(\
/me gives Lyra` candy
I idle here all the time, its not like I just was looking for a pony channel to troll or something.
2,14 or don't, since it's still spam
okay ._.
Its redundence
/me give Lyra` also some candy
not ALWAYS spam
bronystate is spam
^-^
NullRadix, it's special candy that's designed to minimize flavor and maximize tooth decay.
like air burst?
so... it's Black Licorice?
lol
you know whats spam? toot
BronyState is /oat/, not /spam/
NullRadix, that's tasty.
CRUSH HIM BOSS!
no, red licorice is tasty
black licorice is awful
Speaking of oats, I'm craving some oatmeal right now. :D
i want some nature valley bars
dammit I'm hungry
Lyra`: oh I LOVE those, the honey granola are great
/me just ate a donut
IKR!
ur fyat
/me hides his chocolate oatmeal
and i'll even give one to ValtheJean
Renton, seriously it's not incredible EVERY TIME YOU DODGE
Derp
Fail.
he can roast it on his ban trident
you're in a Real Type, they're MADE to be dodgey
MmmmmmmmmmmmmmmBombs
otakon: honey granola are my fave bars!
Judging from these bad guys, I'm guessing Val's going through a mission based on one of the older series.
welp that looked painful
what do you expect, it's Renton
Kandarihu: I think so
2,14 yes, they're enemies from Mazinger
RAWRity: true, he's as easy to impress as dangling keys in front of a baby
2,14 with some dimensional beasts thrown in
mine is the drill that will pierce the heavens! WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?!?
your Lyra`
Oh, okay.
now sit down
Lyra`: obama?
Lyra`: sumerpan
Lyra`: uh uh, it's WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?!
Lyra`: no u

Oooooh boy
RIFFTRAX!
YAY!
otakon: it happened. It's the first episode where Etemon shows up.
Oh shit, I FORGOT TO MAKE POPCORN!
Horray!
actually, forget the popcorn - I have taco bell ^_^
Oh cloverfield
Too late now ..>
I CALLED THE RIFFTRAX
Oh, the rifftrax is starting!
RAWRity: damn wut
This should be interesting........ :D
Never seen Cloverfield before
OH MAH GOD~
Sunday. Midnight. Work in the morning. Movie starting...
inb4 motion sickness
Kandarihu: It's an okay movie, IMO.
I never understood this movie
Kandarihu: Don't. It's terrible
yay
lol
CLOVERFIELD!......meh, it was a standard thriller
going to miss another riffftrac ... what is this time ?
NullRadix, caffience
00,10it's on right now Eddmario
caffiene*
Nope really terrible, but not good either. I find it "okay", at least.
Glitch: CLOVERFIELD
otakon: Mimi goes upstairs to take a shower, but the other kids think she's gone missing. So they run into the room where they hear her voice and well...get their sexual awakening.
ASoftFluffyThing: now or later?
^_^ pitch dark with the lights off - Perfect!
RAWRity: the hell
Ultra Wal-Mart, I still wouldn't shop there.
Hello everypony.
Apparently the monster was hidden in the movie poster
BETTER BE DONKEY KONG! IT BETTER BE DONKEY KONG!
Howdy Canadian_Brony!
NullRadix, Mmmm...both
Hi, Canadian_Brony. :)
otakon: JAPAN!
hiya Canadian_Brony you are JUST in time for Rifftrax for Cloverfield
hello Canadian_Brony
Hi Canadian_Brony :)
RAWRity: they're like 12!
Is there a Rifftrax for the Super Mario Bros movie?
^
Hey Canadian_Brony. Just in time for Motion Sickness the Rifftrax
I remember Teletubbies. :D
I'm sure of it Eddmario
aww so many lag spikes
izzy's even younger.
otakon ooooooh, Shizu stream?
AJIsAwesome: Me too :D
Canadian_Brony: Shizu stream :)
I remember those...I had nightmares for life the first time I sawed those things...
FUCK YEH!!
SMB Movie would be a B movie right? :D
dialga=t.a. giritina=r.d. palkia=i.s.
A little TRIVIA: ''CLOVERFIELD'' was originally supossed to be the codename for the movie, but instead, it turned out to be the ACTUAL TITLE! <------
AJIsAwesome: yeah
00,10this movie got my 7 bucks because they made it seem intersting. I was disapointed
what movie?
Okay.
Why the FUCK is it even called Cloverfield anyway?
"It's me, the UPS guy. I'm here to deliver you a package."
6.47 am, if that were me trying to slap, id already have shoved that camera up his-
surprisenly, i liked the mario brothers movie
13Eddmario: clover is one of the first plants to come back after a nuclear blast
Everlasting_Joy: a penis?
The SMB Movie would be worth riffing
Eddmario: something to do with the you-know-what
I needs sleep? I got Rifftrax :P
*trying to sleep
*Who
I hear the original title to this movie was Rampage (the movie of the NES game)
So, what is this movie about?
/me this moment has been brought to you by UPS
cowvarkian: I said a package, not a penis ;).
13the end of the movie involves nuking central park, thus the codename (and the note at the start saying formerly known as central park)
who does how can i make that robotic voice
oh this is Cloverfield movie?
Canadian_Brony: I actually have no idea, and I've seen it before!
Eddmario: Movie writing....
i've seen this movie before.
00,10more transformers rips
Dark92Enigma: this movie has writing?
ok the stream is moving smoothly now :)
this movie any good?
cowvarkian: poor one
Can someone who knows what the ....aww nevamind]
Still waiting for a sequal to this - or at least more monster movies like this
Dark92Enigma: huh ok
Same here, didn't hate it but was disappointed.
Shizuka so, this is supposed to be a home video of what happens when New York gets nuked in WWIII?
What's up with those lines that are higher pitched? Is one of the riffters or was that an effect?
Cypresswolf: Monster
then i shall enjoy the rifftrax :$
Canadian_Brony: actually, because of an alien, godzilla thing
. . .
13Canadian_Brony: no no see a satellite owned by a japanese company somehow crashes into the ocean and wakes up a baby giant monster that starts bumbling around new york
Everlasting_Joy - it's a sound sync
AJIsAwesome: Not bad or good it's ok
Everlasting_Joy: that's Disembodio, the tracer line that makes sure the riffs are in sync
Monster! what did I type?
13even though NONE OF THAT is explained in the film
those pitches are in the rifftrax so you know that it's lined up
Dark92Enigma: Exactly.
AJIsAwesome: it's like an a-bomb of adequacy
Shizuka: wtf kind of story is that?
13hud here was obviously cast to be ugly because he'll be behind the screen for the rest of the film
MirrorImage and otakon: O.K.
for real Shizuka?? Goodness 8C
hey every pony
Shizuka that is the stupid bullsh*t idea I've heard in a long time. And I know stupid shit; I'm in high school.
hey therainbowvortex
*stupidest
13yeah ded srs btw
Shizuka: ...It's always to be blamed on Japan, isn't it?
hai therainbowvortex :)
Hey therainbowvortex
Hi, therainbowvortex. :)
oh dam, no-one shakes the camera that much
13afaik there's a sequel in development hell
The 2000 Godzilla movie was better then this POS
Howdy therainbowvortex.
13that would involve the clover monster's mom or something
Shizuka: How the FUCK can they even do that?
00,10the first of many motion sick pukes
I mean, we see a TONS of "Made In Japan" product, why the hell not?
cowvarkian: I REMEMBER the Mario Brothers Movie......the most i can remember is that it took FOREVER to get to the action
Dark92Enigma: that'd be fun to riff over
13but yeah the core of it is the monster's supposed to be a baby looking for its mom, because that totally makes sense from the film's point of view
it's like they shook it on purpose
/me wonders why he loved the mario bros movie
13and it revolves around japan because godzilla
Shizuka: It's a BABY!?!? It's the end of Boast Busters all over again...
13ah there she is the only likable character in the whole movie
00,10this movie could have been twice as good if they just invested in a steady cam
Shizuka I wasn't saying I didn't believe you, if you saw it as that.
13look at it this way sumi, this isn't an 80 foot screen :3
I think the baby must be Godzuki...y'know...from the cartoon? ...Watch it peoples.
Sumica: An uncensored lesbian sex scene couldn't save this movie...
what are yall watching?
'Lo SaxyPretender
The sequal involving the monster's mom? That was a BABY monster?
even if they just stuck it on someone's head it would be relatively steady
Eddmario: It'd make it better
0,14oh hai everyone
Hi, SaxyPretender. :)
00,10I did't say save it
SaxyPretender: hey
Hey SaxyPretender!
00,10I said twice as good
ohau SaxyPretender :)
Howdy SaxyPretender!
hello SaxyPretender
ohai SaxyPretender
pony_666 a Rifftrax of a movie with a stupid plotline
hi SaxyPretender
13Cypresswolf: i think the only way they could possibly save a sequel would be to make the clover monster's mom actually be cthulhu
Canadian_Brony: this has a plotline?
cowvarkian: You're thinking of the 2000 Godzilla movie. NOTHING could save this movie...
cowvarkian I dunno
0,14so we're watching one of my favorite movies?
soo someone comentating cloverfield?
why is the camera being held non-level
0,14SWEET
dat extra
00,10we should watch skyline next
Shizuka, but isn't Cthulhu a male?
Sumica: that was a shitty movie
13i didn't say it was a *good* plan
00,10yeah it would go great with this
SaxyPretender: Can't tell if troll or [banned from BronyState for bashing a mod]
I'd watch the HELL out of that movie if Cthulhu was the monster
Oh hey, does anypony here who plays Borderlands 2 tried out the Mechromancer?
13if i had another scary rifftrax i'd queue it but sb is up after me and it'll be like 2am by then
Sumica: I wonder if Shizuka has a rifftrax for that
*has
0,14Not trolling, I actually do like the movie
inb4 shit movies marathon on bronystate
i have its op Canadian_Brony
superretroworld: maybe you liked it for how creative it was for TRYING to adapt the videogame to the big screen, even though they don't look like the originals? yeah....you can't stomp on a turtle in real life, gotta give that movie credit
13i have sixth sense though, if that counts as a scary movie
/me thinks that Cthulhu is male, though she'd be fine with a Cthulhu mother
cowvarkian: it did
A
s
:o
Hug?
00,10I am Heads up Display
brb
maybe
yeah
Shizuka: E-mail SB the rifftrax and have him steam it then. Or you could switch to a rifftrax of a movie that's actually savable...
Shizuka: oh, WHEN you'll show the Sixth Sense?
pony_666 very op, but I'm not talking about that. I gave her the skin "Reddy Steddy Go" and renamed her "Pinkie Pie"
I'M HIDING MY HORRIBLE ACTING BY SHAKING THIS CAMERA AND TRYING TO LOOK COL!
cool*
lol
Shizuka got I See Dead Peoples: The Motion Picture? SWEET!
Dark92Enigma: it was pretty creative, but i think i liked it for the story
00,10Supprise you walked in to a crapy movie
It's S2E14 all over again.
Sumica*
fuu
0,14SPEEEEEEEEECH
dat tab fail :3
wat is this???
MINE
no speech 4 u
MINE
THE SPEEEEEEECH of freedom!
superretroworld: it still left me dissapointed with the cliffhanger
MINE
thats amazing canadian borny
13i think i'll do the other two spidermen between here and wednesday, sixth sense when i get back next week
Ok :)
Cool. :)
yay
Shizuka: Do you have the Evil Dead movies (no rifftrax needed)
2/10 would not be surprised
0,14not-so-fun fact: yes
13i don't
hey has any pony played slender
0,14there are people like this in Manhattan
Dark92Enigma: same, i guessing they wanted another sequel but probaly from the negative reception
i love this movie
wat is this???
0,14this is part of the reason I liked how that borough got wrecked
00,10main dude
DARK: A rifftrax of Cloverfield, AKA the WORST movie in existance
You know, this movie reminded me of Blair Witch, camera and all
SaxyPretender: you're welcome
I hear Gorillaz
so wait guy headed to japan gets attacked by giant monster talk about ironic
0,14also, dat Gorillaz
13Eddmario: nah that's anything produced by the epic movie guys
00,10and the entire budget of this film when to this 30 second loop of gorlliza
O Hai DARK!
0,14XD
The ONLY good part about this movie is the music
SaxyPretender remind me never to go to NY then, I deal with enough crazy people up here.
Shizuka: No, this is worse
Eddmario: Well I don't know if they'd do Evil Dead 1 since we saw it within the last six months
Shizuka: Thank you for bringing that nightmare up again.
Sumica: basicly
13sorry .-.
13um ponies?
superretroworld: And you gotta understand how angry they were
13just lie back and think of ponies
GORILLAZ! F*** YEAH!
J_E_Smith71: I don't mind, as I actually haven't seen the second or third movie
Shizuka: >.>
*movies
Shizuka: Actually, that worked :).
Eddmario: i agree with Shizuka there
00,10even the camera is drunk
epic movie with ponies?
hey guys i cant help but think ive missed somthing
13i'll give them credit for the editing in this film since it's not one continuous shot by any stretch
0,14we passed by the chick passed out on the couch right?
Dark92Enigma: oh yes
In this segment the Buddha isdrunk
Well, I'm outta here before this movie makes me forget what I did last week
Shizuka: OH WAIT WHA--- NO....THE NIGHTMARES AGAIN!
Sumica the camera's always drunk
SaxyPretender, yep
0,14ah
Shizuka: jk
What the?! Did the camera have a seizure
Bye, Eddma- gone.
0,14that chick is a big figure in the ARG that led up to the movie
SaxyPretender: the arg?
13in that segment the buddha is holding a camera in one hand and a PBR in the other
13cowvarkian: 90% of the film's story was done in an alternate reality game before the movie's release
00,10can we just nuke them now?
0,14Alternative-
13that's why the movie itself sucks so bad
Shizuka: ok then
In time, Sumica. In time.
13sorry saxy.. years of typing practice .-.
Sumica *sigh* we all wish
Sumica: No, we have to make you hate them more.
0,14it's coo' XD
I just finished reasing Bridge in Background Pony from shortskirtandexplosion....
00,10Everlasting_Joy, that is not posable
why this movie??
00,10that would be like haveing too much dakka
0,14actually, to get the FULL story, you need the Blu-Ray
DARK because Rifftrax
Because Rifftrax.
and people say MLD is the most tearing piece of litterature of the fanbase
0,14ARG has such a little payoff in the movie
Canadian_Brony: That ninja. :P
13DARK: cause let's face it, no one was voting for this movie anytime soon
00,10this movie is why I did't go see super 8
lol ^
0,14Super 8 was alright
In that segment the buddha just ninja'd someone for the millionth time
Sumica: :)
Super 8 wasnt that bad
anyway late now and I have work tomorrow
13i heard super 8 was relatively okay, might have to look into it sometime
Sumica: super 8 was.. yeah alright
0,14not shakycam, at least
BYe, CrimsonPhoenix. :)
good bye everyone
Shizuka: and i see why
it was
well that's good
13the trailer of sorts in portal 2 was... odd
AJIsAwesome that's impossible, I'm playing as Mechromancer, not Zero
00,10the only think intersting about super8 was the interactive trailer
0,14Super 8 was essentially, "What if JJ Abrams made a Spielberg movie?"
Shizuka: I'm gonna check Super 8 sometime too-----
"They're sleeping together." What a shock. . . :|
13oh marlena, if only you didn't get a bridge dropped on you
00,10useing sourse
so, anybody here seen The Cabin in the Woods?
Yes, Lily! Tell us while I film this on his Goodbye Documentary
Canadian_Brony: Oh yeah, I forgot. :D
i swear ijust watched a porn with her in it
OH WHHHHHHHAT A TWEEEEEST?
Before I go, I really can't recommend it enough, go read Background Pony it's amazing
AJIsAwesome so then you heard what I renamed her?
Tell EVERYBODY!
00,10they do have super8 on netflix i might give it a shot
13hey hey
Canadian_Brony: Yep. Nice.
CrimsonPhoenix: a fanfic?
Shizuka: hey
13ready overanalysis?
yes
oOGriofa Oh ....SNAP?
I haven't been following the plot, but I don't think I'd learn anything useful anyways XD
I love how the camera is trying to get boob shots in. . . Really poor taste.
13so this is supposed to be the DOD replaying this tape right
0,14dudemanmandudedudemandude
0,14yep, Shizuka
Shizuka: yesh
00,10i have that song
13considering the mission relevant stuff doesn't happen until like 20 minutes in
00,10I love that song
13wouldn't they crop it?
What I missed?
juggle cats
13i mean really, the DOD doesn't care about these kids any more than we do
Shizuka: they should've
cropped it
Need to sleep, Shizu starts streaming. Ffffffffff. ;_;
00,10this is the first screaning of it Shizuka
Shizuka: no wonder why he never showed his face
CriticKitten, Sleep is for the weak
Shizuka: Can we then call the DOD heros?
13explosions will arrive in a few moments ponies
yay explosions
and death
Shizuka: and the Nostalgia Critic references
Shizuka: eh, just don't bother thinking about the gimmic. It'll cause nothig but headaches, adn there's enough headaches in this film.
perhaps leaving the boring stuff in was a defense tactic - oh this is just a family video - nothing classified here
O.O
studied rhetoric under shaggy...
finally
goddamn finally
oh look, a blackout. PANIC!!!
00,10hey Shizuka, I got silver medal in my shotgunn today.
not even a blackout
13yay~
LOOK OUT! IT'S THE SECOND COMING!
WHO HIT THE PANIC BUTTON?!
0,14yes, New Yorkers overreact like this
Sumica: and i has silver in scattercannon~
0,14not joking
LOOK OUT! IT'S DONKEY KONG!
00,10indeed

that's sad

Sumica: WTF BOOOM~
Sumica: my parents when I tell them my bad grades?
CriticKitten, oooohhh. What grade/level? Please don't say high school seniors or high school
Shizuka: to quote Shia Lebeouf: NONONONONONONONONONO
how is a sinking oil tanker a cause for delaying a trip by PLANE?
TRIVIA: The Nostalgia Critic's 7TH Episode ACTUALLY involves this movie
FRAG OUT
In this segment the Buddha is running for his life
Oh god, this movie's turning into a poor man's Transformers already
ASoftFluffyThing: High School.
O.O
man, if it was the marshmellow man, that would be awesome
ASoftFluffyThing: Yes, seriously.
Shizuka sounds like the mic chat in MvM when you're playing with noobs and a lone tank enters.
00,10you bastards
lol
In this segment, the bhudda is vomiting from all the camera shake
In this segment, the Buddha is being trampled by a giant space monster
13fun fact, that head is like twice as big as the actual head
CriticKitten: actually it's more a poor man's transformers meets a poor man's Blaire Witch Project
0,14that's actually bigger than the actual-
but yeah good night everybody
Dat South Park ref
Dat South Park.

ASoftFluffyThing: It's okay, I'm giving tests to half my classes so I won't need as much sleep to function. Four to five hours should be fine.
13SaxyPretender: just about everything post-9/11 that features a tall tower falling goes through reviews so it falls in just the right way to not resemble the twin towers
YES GO OUTSIDE WITH THE MONSTER

why so muchhate towards this movie?
Shizuka: not to mentioned decapitated the statue of liberty
13it's a horrible horror
00,10they dont exactly have alot of options Shizuka
wouldn't the best thing to do be to hide in a basement?
13see bill just said it :3
0,14also, there was supposed to a scene where you see the Monster eating people through tubes on its chest
0,14which is what Marlena saw
0,14also, commentary got it right
J_E_Smith71, Welp, tell it to go to the Arctic Ocean

Yes Hud - people are going to watch your video & the thousands of others being filmed via cell phone around you
Doesn't Scoots live in New York too?
0,14>going to Manhattan
but yeah, this movie does what way too many modern horror films do: populates it with a group of unlikable assholes, and then kills them off by some uninteresting means until eventually you get a sequel hook.
Maybe the batteries must powered with a battery INSIDE of a battery!
0,14...wait, what
WB Panda|Drawing

0,14also, Rob lost his brother
JAAAAAAAAAY
SOOOOOOOOOON
Shizuka: yet surprisingly still better cinematography than Bayformers
13point
0,14he's more worried about saving his passive-agressive semi-girlfriend
00,10fucking humans
^
0,14THAN LOSING HIS FUCKING BROTHER
*insert Discord song here*
Sumica: Im one of those
Ah yes, the scum shows themselves. In times of panic, loot >: (.
RAWRity just about any movie has better cinematography than Bayformers
Why do aliens hate humans so much? Can they do things peacefully?
diaster happens, insted of running away, raid stores
0,14who's said it's an alien, SpadeMagnes[R]?
Hmm....destruction. chaos. misery....
SpadeMagnes[R]: it has nothing to do with hate, its just a confused child
hey, they could be seen as saving that stuff from feeding the monster :D
Canadian_Brony: yes, but this is meant to look like it's from a handheld camera, and still looks better.
This is all the works of...
FAIRY GODPARENTS!
VenHur: RED HERRING!
0,14truth be told, NYC is actually not that bad about looting
Shizuka: And even with all these explosions, they KNOW how to USE THEM
If that thing is a child, I would fucking hate to see the parents
AND LEAVE SOME ROOM FOR THE STORY
SaxyPretender as far as I know, nobody says what it is specifically
0,14during the big blackout years ago, don't think there was much looting
:D
''Story''
inb4 Red Herring is secretly the monster
Do we ever see the monster fully?
I love how people are still looting despite a 30 story monster rampaging about :D
SpadeMagnes[R]: Body and Head.

Oh come on! i was watching SPONGEBOB
Evacuate! Hell No, these electronics are FREE for the taking
No, it was the snail race episode.

Nostalgia Critic reference in 3...2...1......
Why is the military always aniliated when aliens attack?
Everlasting_Joy: THAT'S FOR YESTERDAY SQUAREPANTS
13mm i don't think it was the snail race one, sandy was in that twice and never against a green background smiling
Cant we have ONE instance where the millitary survives?
hd dvds
not aliens mutants its a godzila ripoff
ROB?! Why aren't you playing Gyromite?????!!!!!
SpadeMagnes[R]: no
00,10and then they add the totaly wtf little monsters taht server no logic to be rideing the big monster
:D
0,14also, if Mister Grumpy Pants is like a few blocks away...shouldn't the parasites be swarming them
0,14Sumica, they're like underwater ticks/parasites
That was the monster, right?
Shizuka: :D.
It pisses me off that the millitary always gets its shit wrecked when aliens attack

How does a bro say they're feeling kind of me? Bro-So
Dark92Enigma: Not really, I think the legs.
"I know what I'm doing." There it is folks, the dumbest line in this film thus far.
0,14see, Marlena and Hud are the voices of reason
press X to Rob
13yep
13and who gets killed off next
Dark92Enigma: Wait, nvm. The body.

Shizuka: is it Santa?
AJIsAwesome: ok.....this is the part of the movie, when i said....IT BETTER BE BOWSER
Rob?
Press X for Gyromite!
Ill see you guys later
TAke care cowvarkian!
out running the monster is a bad idea run towards it inorder to get behind it
13an entire armored platoon just snuck up on us huh

AJIsAwesome: and he better have toast
0,14oh hai MGP :3
Sumica: SO MUCH FAILURE AIM

Sumica: I was meaning you, wre-k, and me.
I used to like this movie a lot when it first came out
That's the head AJIsAwesome?
Everlasting_Joy: im being fat mc fat fat man
oGriofa: Michael Bay is the Monster? Seems legit.
Canadian_Brony: they'll hump the monster to death
Dark92Enigma: Not sure.
RAWRity XD
0,14so they're in Chinatown right now
There wasnt an alley they could run down? No, run toward the monster the army behind us is shooting at - stay classy movie
yay we still have a camera man
13that brief black where the camera hit the floor marked a new day of filming
Why does this guy still have the camera on him?
Dark92Enigma: You'll see it clearly near the end of the movie.
00,10they also show the same weapons disaplen that playes do in planetside
Logically
VenHur: I KNEW IT, he couldn't be a person, HE HAD TO BE A MONSTER
Shammy: ?
SpadeMagnes[R]: the plot demans it?
*demands
LOGICALLY WHY WOULD HE KEEP IT WITH HIM
0,14I've been to that station for Bronycon last year
Dark92Enigma: If it's Bowser, hold the DS Horizontally and breath into the mic to breath fire, and slide the stylus to punch
0,14doesn't quite look like that iirc
i told u to feed him
00,10Everlasting_Joy, he meens he likes max units
Everlasting_Joy: me sumi Wre-k Shizuka Bronysith...uhm killerpony7733....and like 3 other people we all play it together
00,10shammy is good with them
If its bowser get Mario and Luigi

13related to manbropig

Sumica: Oh, o.k :).
shouldn't they get away before the spider things find them?
BROSKI OF THE WEEK <---
Dark92Enigma: Okay. We have about 42 minutes until the head shows up clearly.
Shammy: :D Excellent! A large platoon!
no its not! we suck!
00,10so is the monster just dancing around up top?
. . . sure
/me sends out pokemon to combat the monster

/me does the Dinosaur
00,10Jaysun
Whos a adorable giant killing machine
You are! Yes you are!
0,14there's actually a good reason it's kicking the shit out of the military
0,14it's skin is super hard
13because ocean
0,14yep
SaxyPretender: i thought it was becaue the army has the worst fucking aim in the world
Sounds like the Iron Giant to me, Saxy.
haha
13it's also really stupid cause the ocean is so DENSE
13hehehe
0,14ahaha
it's a giant trilobyte, isn't it
stupid ocean, it's all your fault!
SaxyPretender: Here's another reason.....they don't have any FISH
hey sumica can you please check Geoff's IP
^
00,10did he just do a chadower reffrence?
THAT'S A LOT OF FISH
big ol kabuto thing
How does the ocean prevent it from getting the shit blown out of it?
Dark92Enigma: :D
obviously we have to destroy the ocean
MAKO MUST DIE
ntfwc: With fire?
Isnt that right ocean
13SpadeMagnes[R]: ocean pressure leads to a hard skin to deal with it
. . . .
mako already died
00,10what flutterchu?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Mako already died :'(
Phase4: can you check Geoff's IP
back in 2004
Sumica: same thing i asked Phase4
13flutterchu: asking a different mod doesn't answer the question
mmm, tacos
????
the Nostalgia Ciritc found out himself
TACOS?! YES! I WOULD GO FOR SOME TACOS!
AJIsAwesome: wow, somepony DID laugh at the joke
00,10who is geoff
but wouldnt the pressure change kill it?
0,14and the little tick guys? they're kinda like those fish that are on sharks and manta rays

I'm going to climb Moutain Dew.
SpadeMagnes[R]: We can only hope so.
MountainDew makes everything better.
Geoff_Parker proud and true
Someone tell her what her back looks like, please?
Stay tuned for the most unrealistic death of this movie. Coming up
:)
00,10yeah that would hurt
SpadeMagnes[R]: we've all watched this movie...so WHY NOT
Or at least get something to try and close it.
/me climbs Mountain Dew.

Dark92Enigma: I havent, admittingly
"A hub free world"
"You about to die. You might as well let me get some, before you kick the bucket."

SpadeMagnes[R]: Oh ok
monster makes u pee different colors
A Hub free world. No ponies? :(
00,10so how much did they pay to keep dew on screen that long
/me drinks a rc
Not that I would really care if anything got spoiled for me, I never cared for this
rc=rc cola
Now THAT is a scary thought - Hub free world
Or die in the bathroom
Why dont we bribe the monsters with candy?
00,10Hud you should have been left behind
Hub free world... *gulp*
they have a mt dew in the kitchen :O
SpadeMagnes[R]: That's only the lawyers.
whats hub free world?
/me is leaving the building
jk
This movie was the last movie where the Neville Page monster/alien design was still relevant. Eversince then I am sick of Neville Page design. AVATAR or Super 8...
It is in every hollywood movie
So where the hell did the monster right now?
00,10why the dutch angle
mwhahahahahahah
*go
0,14can't remember where that's supposed to be
Sumica: because gimmick
mwhaahhaahahha
LENSFLARE
I can't see a damn thing!
shouldnt the batteries on that camera have run out by now? I doubt Hud ever thought about recharging it
Yep she dies next
mwhahahaahhah
Sumica: Well;Dutch angle is supposed to make the viewer uncomfortable, to give a sense of dread. BUt, I dunno why they used it here, the whole movie is pretty dreadful...
I knew it
I'm really idly just so you know
This is a J.J. Abrams production, SpadesMagnes[R] - of course there are Lensflares
00,10this was the point of the movie where I had to stop watching
But some of us are still alive here :P
00,10was too sick
Be right back, bathroom break for me.
imabout to esplode
TURN OFF THE LENSFLARE
Sumica physically or mentally?

Gah my eyes!

0,14ooh, F-18s
But I like Bacon, Egg and Cheese combos.... :(
"Give me all the eggs and bacon you have."
It's a shame when you see that the MONSTER IS THE BEST ACTOR IN THIS MOVIE......:(
i rember i was here and was watching family matters and fresh prince
:(
00,10move move move
6xD That's good ^^
AJIsAwesome: no....GREEN EGGS AND HAM!
13boomer
Cant there be one movie where the millitary stands a chance against a alien force?
who was here watching fresh prince and family matters?
send in my little guns
:L
WHAT ABOUT BOOMER, Shizuka !?
SpadeMagnes[R]: just like the guards in mlp
SpadeMagnes[R]: What about ID4?
:T
13you're about to see
ALIEN!
STILL HOLDING THE CAM
KILL IT WITH FIRE
Dark92Enigma: Oh I, frquently think every know and then, of the glorious food of the noble hen~
Total boomer inc
>:-)
out comes the xenomorphs
yeah not what you think there
0,14So, the monster (and therefore the ticks) feed on some sort of "sea nectar", and when they bite you, you get a whole bunch of it in your blood. It doesn't react well with humans on such a massive scale.
wait, chest burster?
"I am freaked out and scared of my crush, but I will still dutifully keep recording."
.................
13cause... that makes sense...
Now this is ripping of Alien?
what does this mean, i am trying to figure it out,FTW
It's bad enough by itself!
what is ftw
SaxyPretender: makes as much sense as Vampire Venom in Twilight
SaxyPretender: actually it was theorized that they cause local welts to get TO the blood on the creature.
00,10she just inflated till she popped
Am I wrogn to say I dont get anything about this plot?
13so, the only likable character is dead, half an hour to go
They're ripping off "Alien". Wow.
IT'S.........AN ALIEN RIPOFF!!!!
i don't go on chat's that often
SaxyPretender: sadly on humans it causes the blood pressure to build into you explode
Shizuka: Who was the likable character in this movie?
IT IS NOT
so she was killed by...inflation?
13the one that just blew up
Shizuka: i can do this!
0,14nope, it's the sea necter
Dark92Enigma I just said that..
its godzila with facehuggers
ntfwc: blood pressure actually
0,14blu-ray commentary confirms it
Shizuka: She was likeable?
SaxyPretender but the real question is: WTF is sea nectar?
go go go\
These are all asshole yuppies
00,10yeah she expanded and popped
I am going to hit the hay folks. Good night!
Canadian_Brony: sorry.....i've run out of things to say
Night, Everlasting_Joy. :)
Night, Everlasting_Joy
hi
GO GO MOVE GO MOVE MOVE GO GO GO GO MOVE
0,14it makes Slusho delicious, Canadian_Brony!
Let all those yuppies die
13but at least hud dies too
SaxyPretender: it's funny how the more they try to EXPLAIN the movie, the worse it gets.
Hi everyone

Why is he still holding onto the camera at this point?
Night Everlasting_Joy
Hi Geoff_Parker :)

lol
0,14...which is why I do >.>
The CAMERAMAN is an asshole
i was here 10 mins ago
13RAWRity: mostly because it's all from the ARG and not the movie
00,10they all die that makes me happy
hey cynder
HORSY
RUN PONY RUN
"And for some reason the recording format of my camera changed at the beginning when the shit hit the fan. I have no idea how this happened, but the sensor format changed. That. Makes. Sense!!!"
PONY
0,14also, notice how she was screaming for Hud who's she known for like...a few hours, and not Lily who's her friend
Flee!
godspeed pony
0,14>punch card
The pony is the only one to survive the movie
hi
:P
hi
WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE THE MONSTER AGAIN!
Shizuka: also, it doesn't NEED to be explained. We can surmise from the dialogue that something caused by the spider-thing bites leads to exploding. That's all we need given the POV
13SaxyPretender: given how he like immediately zooms in when she enters the party, i think hud's had a crush on her for a while before
hi [Name_Invalid]
6Hey ^^
00,10buildings dont work like that
SpadeMagnes[R]: *SQUEE*
0,14ah, tru dat
my name got banned so i am called name invalid
So what are they trying to do now?
BUILDINGS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY!
and my stream died!
Shizuka so, he's actually developing character by how he takes a shot? That's . . . creative.
00,10also how dose it still have power
Has anybody died yet?
What the hell?!!?
It's creative!!
Right...because when a monster is rampaging, WE WANT TO GO UP
WHY
JUST WHY
The ending of this movie is the stupidest part. When the stupid helicopter operator didn't just fly in the opposite direction
why are they going into a building?
...oh my god
Eddmario yes. The only likeable character
00,10cause Rob is a fucking moron
0,14well, he's had a crush on her...but she doesn't know he exists
Canadian_Brony: he's a living DRINKING GAME?
why is fluttershy so, you know, shy?
wtf
13they all are
have you guys seen today's Google Doodle?
just...it's glorious
Ok if a monster was rampaging in a city, where would you go?
Yep Little Nemo anniversary
13space jump? or something else
darwin awards for all of them I guess
SpadeMagnes[R]: http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww268/thechairman45/RobotnikWHYsig.jpg
Dark92Enigma basically
AJIsAwesome what's up!
Sure.....now she took off her shoes...
Hi, [Name_Invalid].
13hm.. will have to check that later
Shizuka: Little Nemo anniversary
lol
[Name_Invalid]: it's just.......she been throught alot....i know it.....that's um whay i liek her....we have alot in common
SO they figure a person is still in her apartment?
Ok why would you go into a tall area when a monster could easily smash it to bits?
WHAT?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Logic. What's that?
bc idiots
13she's walking around barefoot
13BY A BROKEN WINDOW
no
13glass is made out of rubber in this universe i guess...
*sigh*
lol, kool-aid man
00,10lets not use the camera's light or night vision or grapeling hook
that is . . . no
Ok bets on who dies first rob or the chick
Oh, THIS part. I suggest closing your eyes for the next 30 minutes if you don't like the sign of gore
Shizuka: i think its already been established they are stupid
SpadeMagnes[R]: Chick.
that's just . . . no!
13should use the camera's jetpack
No! That's stupid!
13stupid kids
Shizuka: I TRIED to tell you earlier, but SaxyPretender TOLD ME : no links.....or was it VAL?
who saw the fresh prince halloween episode?
well bye bye everypony i have to go to work
SpadeMagnes[R]: The chick. I'll just take the winnings now
"I played enough Assassins Creed to know how this works.
Bye Maid_RainBow
Shizuka: not the teleporter?
Why don't they leave the city? I mean wtf?
Does anyone live through this?
I'm back, what I missed...?
ntfwc: They're trying to
Shizuka: or CHEAP PLASTIC FILLED WITH RED PAINT
VenHur you missed everything
SpadeMagnes[R]: What do you think?
13ntfwc: cause rob thinks he's going to save his girlfriend and.. these two are with him because.... god only knows
00,10you missed 70 min of shakky cam
Im guessing...no? Eddmario ?
lol
[Nave_Invalid]: Noooooooooo!!
Shizuka: because friendship
Eyup
...

Thats depressing
ntfwc they're dumbasses who fled to a bridge when a monster that decimated a skyscraper is closing in

At least the pony survived
13guys, i love you all, but if we were in a city being attacked by a monster, ya'll are on your own
did he say"drop those panties?"
in the attempt of reaching Manhatten
indeed
Shizuka: I totally respect that.
Ok, where would you go if a monster attacked your city?
hmm
Shizuka deal
I don't know
Shizuka: id be following you cause you would know what the fuck to do..
it's ok Shizuka we'd leave you behidn too
This looks familiar... Inception did it better.
yep
0,14so, I went to a zombie surival panel yesterday, with two of my friends
0,14we agreed, I'd be the first to go
Well, Im glad Im out in the country then :D
:D
0,14they'd make it through
:D
00,10it's like that bit in inception only with the lights off
lol
I can't see shit!
SPOILER ALERT! Someone dies right now
on new jersey and kool aid man part
The hell's going on...
13squeamish should look away now
Where is samus when you need her?
so, fun little thought experiment: Suddenly bronystate in in a Donner Party situation. Who would you elect to be eatan first?
/me stares intently at the stream
So they came all the way for her
*eaten
/me is talking in 3rd person
ded
RAWRity: You of course
ded
Name invalid likes to talk in 3rd person
ooh, she's alive?
RAWRity Meanwhile

RAWRity, what's a Donner Party situation?
Monster Survival plan - know the way out - study back roads, avoid the highways
name invalid likes this show
ASoftFluffyThing: cannibalism in order to survive
dunno, but I elect Meanwhile to be eaten first. Followed by Scoot-Scootaloo
RAWRity, ohh.
If he stuck his junk in that hole, would it be considered tit fucking?
ASoftFluffyThing a situation when you cant go anywhere with a lack of food and water..soo noms on each other
13i guess the rebar threaded the hole of the aorta and missed everything important
Eddmario: ...seriously?
Eddmario . . . . . . . . .
Eddmario: ..........
................
I'm going to have to watch this movie again, just to count how many times Hud was told to put the damn camera down
oh hey monster
What'd they just do?
night everypony
It's the monster!!
ASoftFluffyThing I"m trying to figure that out
night superretroworld :)

Night superretroworld

Canadian_Brony, I looked away.
0,14I chuckled at the "terrible thing" lines
MAYBE BEING IN THIS BUILDING IS A BAD IDEA
Hey Trollestia
00,10did they realy just walk up to the roof?
0,14>stars
0,14>NYC
Trollestia: Please pick a nick and stay with it. :)
0,14ahahahahahahahhahahahahaahha
Oh my god, Trollestia?!
DUN DUN DUUUUN!
heh table salt
Can we ever have a steady camera angle in this?
Sumica yes. They are that stupid
basically, a group of people called the Donner Party were heading west to stake their claim in the unclaimed lands of the US. They left late in the year and with minimal supplies, and eventually had to resort to eating one another to keep from all starving to death.
13now, if i had enough brain cells removed that i was designated camera pony for this disaster
SpadeMagnes[R]: At the end
13i'd record more than half a second of monster >>
0,14^
^^
SHIT!
KILL IT!
nom nom
I once had thoughts baout changing my nick to something else. But eh. Maybe at somepoint I will
13>people need to know man
KILL IT!
bawgs!

Damn it otakon, you ruined a magnificent combo!
also terrible
Thats another thing, also tribble
IT JUST WANTED A HUG D:
13also dat star wars explosion effect
Why no hugz
i just spilled milk all over my dads shoe haha
SaxyPretender IKR? I live in a much smaller city and I've never seen a single star in the sky . . . that may have something to do with our (lack of) air quality, though
SpadeMagnes[R]: yeah a hug that makes you explode in a ball of blood
what I'm saying is, anybody with the last name Donner they probably should not be taken on a roadtrip
6xDDD
00,10hud is the most anoying tripod ever
dat's a biggun
Squish
0,14looked like Grand Central
run tword the lenz flare
Sumica: he doesn't work to well either

Eddmario because ponies
Eddmario: bc it's hilarious

Petrified_Discord: It's a Nokia brand
00,10but top half
the pasing of the camera
13ninja'd by otakon even saxy :3
and it's STILL chasing him
Where did the monster go after eating Hud?
Eddmario: Alien monster attack? Choose Nokia.
13back to the pocket dimension it was hiding in before the shot
0,14so fun fact: this is the greystone (or so) bridge
0,14the original title was-
00,10it came down on him from above
0,14HOLY SHIT
AJIsAwesome: Tell me if the monster shows up

So how did the monster sneak up on them?
0,14I WAS AT COMIC CON

I think that monster has Half Life portal capabilities
13silly saxy, they reference comicon all the time
...
Dark92Enigma: Did you not see the monster's face?
SaxyPretender good for you!
0,14but yeah, original title was Greystone
wait it's CHASING THEM?
Y U NO LEAVE
0,14I've been there
perhaps it is attracted to the camera. AHAH I knew it gains it's power from eating technology
/me used to live down the streeet from comic con >.>
WHY IS IT CHASING TWO HUMANS
MegADooms: bc it can outrun them
13otakon: it's wandering aimlessly, military's about to nuke the city
AND Y U NO ARRIVE AT THEM
0,14to that bridge
Wait a minute, it was night when they got in the helicopter, and it was day when it crashed. DA FUCK?!?!
Shizuka: lovely
Annnnnd. I got busted. So I have to go to bed now. Good night :(
SpadeMagnes[R]: It's trying to end the movie.
Night Ponies47 :(
nighty Ponies47
00,10we
phai Invi :3
Night, Ponies47. :)
night Ponies47
So is the origional camera man dead?
Ohai*
g'night Ponies47
00,10realy took the time to sound air raid
night Ponies47
HIS NAME IS ROBERT HAWKINS
Night Ponies47
lol
:P
His name is Robert Hawkens
Okay hold on
yup
His name is Robert Hawkins
OH MY GOD HE SPAT ME ONTO THE ISLAND FROM LOST! LOCKE, LOCKE, DID YOU SEE THE GIANT MONSTER? HE WAS SO CREEPY! HEY, IS THAT GUY FROM LORD OF THE RINGS REALLY DEAD? I LIKED THAT GUY! HE WAS COOOOL!
HOW did this tape SURVIVE a nuke?
AJIsAwesome: waIL
13magic
His name is Robert Hawkins...
0,14who said it was a nuke?
13actually
JAYSON!
SaxyPretender: everyone does
0,14it's like a MOAB
AJIsAwesome: WAIT.....i saw it
13otakon: plot armor, it's kept the camera safe so far
Good afternoon BronyState :)
His name is Rober Hawkins...
Shizuka: the ONLY character to survive
3
MOAB?
2
otakon, it was made of the same material that indestructible Nokia phone was
0,14actually, they did say it was a MOAB
AJIsAwesome: nostalgia critic reference in 3...2...1....
1
13SaxyPretender: the title cloverfield, meant to be a codename for a nuked zone, since clovers are the first thing to grow back
So is the monster just on a baby temper tantrum?
Hi AdamTheDuck :)
SaxyPretender: so yeah nuke
gota get dat moab
0,14that was the popular theory
0,14buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
13though
and nuked
.BULLSHIT! ALL THAT BUILD UP, ALL THIS TIME, ALL OF THAT JUST FOR A FUCKING MONSTER? SUCK MY DICK! IF I WANNA SEE MONSTERS I GO TO THE DMV TO GET MY LICENSE RENEWED!
13yeah that's not a nuke
0,14the only reason it's called that
man, that sure was a powerful Nuke
13aaand there's the satellite that kicks off the movie
Testing.
and that is where it ends
So wai what did he tape over?
0,14is because there was a street called Cloverfield outside of thr studio
Everybody get ready to NOT see the ufo even if you're looking for it.
0,14JJ Abhrams liked the name
0,14that's literally it
where is this, Disneyland?
Good news the pony survived
oh, Coney Island
SaxyPretender: well, that's Abrhams for you
and that was the end?
Guess what? It's the best part of the movie: THE ENDING!
SaxyPretender: full of shit
Testing.
0,14so the bomb is not a nuke, it's a Fuel-Air Ordinance Bomb
it found its way to equestria before the nuke
ntfwc eeyup
yeah that's it
ugh
So what im getting is...the monster was a baby...
0,14also
That was it...?
I think i love this stream, and everybody here
wow, that was dissapointing
Let's watch Super 8 next time shall we?
THAT was it?
0,14depends on who's being asked
13and yeah
13that was it
00,10droping a moab is also BS
XylemTube: I'm loved?! <3
So I just missed out on a movie? ;~;
Shizuka: fast forward creds?
0,14Monster is either dead
0,14or....
AdamTheDuck: you didn't miss much
that was a disapointing ending
00,10they are so big they cant be droped normaly
13nah people say the credits music is good
And was it just on a temper tantrum or something?
That was it? :S
SaxyPretender: I doubt it's dead
0,14still alive
13i haven't sat through it though
...What happens? Did they both died? Did they lived?! EXPLAIN TO ME, MOVIE!
so thats it
SpadeMagnes[R]: it got woke up from under the ocean, it's a baby
good night everypony~ Shammy is off to sleep
THIS. FILM. WAS. OKAY. Just...okay. Not good, not bad, it's just...okay. How's the monster? It's okay. How's the acting? It's okay. How are the special effects? IT'S ALL OKAY! It's like a giant, flaming, nuclear ball of adequacy! So if you like shaky cameras and monsters going "WAAH!" chances are you're gonna like Cloverfield. 5/10
VenHur: got blown up by the military
VenHur: All you need to know is... Boomer will live.
Night, Shammy. :)
Night, Shammy
Night Shammy :)
0,14btw, would people be okay, if I cleared up plot details with a +m?
nighty Shammy
surprises........not much digital camera last an hour and 13 minutes
Sumica: i thought they fit a b2 bomb shaft?
SaxyPretender: go ahead
13go for it :3
Shammy Night~
00,10they then packed the remans of the monster in a train car and called it super 8
whos streaming
inb4 +m
SaxyPretender more than happy
HOLY SHIT/10
...Oh well, maybe we'll find out...never...
VenHur: everyone died except for BOOMER and the PONY
Goodnight Shammy
13super 8 was an actual alien from what i recall from reviews
6Gtg..see you guys!
0,14alright guys
0,14so, a few key things
00,10nope Dark_Horst, MOAB has to be droped from a C17
cya
13i mean it's an alien not a monster woken up
0,14THAT is not the only monster
awww
just missed :/
0,14there are many more, and one attacked Japan
:(
0,14it's an underwater creature and a baby looking for mommy as Shizuka said
13anyone hearing godzilla theme tribute here
00,10they had to tribute somthing
0,14it feeds off of "sea nectar" (that they put into soft drinks)
0,14the ticks eat that too
13it takes this many people to make a movie suck this bad
0,14so raw sea necter + blood = BOOMER
13cause that makes sense..
00,10all I am hearing is bullshit bullshit retcon retcon
0,14oh yeah, the satellite at the end clonked the monster and woke it up, i think
0,14aand the kicker?
0,14Hud gets a posthumous medal
0,14highest one a civilian can get
13how exactly did the satellite fall intact enough to wake a monster presumably way down in the ocean without making a bigger wave
0,14oh no wait
0,14it was awake before that
11,02so many colors
13suddenly sb
0,14it attacked a off shore oil rig
13thought it was the mom that did that
11,02What's the +m for? o.o
0,14did they ever confirm that?
13is what i read anyway
0,14Oh, I'm clearing up the plot for Cloverfield
0,14but yeah
13mom attacks oil rig, baby is woken by satellite
11,02Okay, then after you I have an important announcement to make.
13uh oh
0,14also, monster can be controlled by people :3
13wait what
0,14and the ticks too :3
13wat
0,14and it can be killed by love :3
13so much wat
0,14there was a manga, Cloverfield/Kishin
0,14liscened by JJ
0,14I do believe it's in canon
13see kids, if you're going to make a movie, put plot details IN THE GODDAMN MOVIE
0,14which means humanity is FUCKED if its siblings wake up
0,14okay, I'm done
13in summary, japan
13all you need to know
11,02Alright, time for my announcement
11,02Wii U launches in 34 days.
11,02Dat is all :3
0,14...
THAT IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT
Shizuka: it's Donnie Darko all over again, yet worse

Best announcement evar
Going to Illinois are you Shizuka Oh my....
/me comforts SaxyPretender
Shizuka: have fun surviving Illinois. I've heard terrible things.
SaxyPretender XD
SERIOUSLY END CREDITS!
11,02VenHur: \:3/
13so many people went into making this movie terrible
SaxyPretender but how do humans control it?
HAH, SEE WHAT I DID THERE?! I MADE A PUN!
Why are you going to Illinois Shizuka ?
at least there isn't a colverfield fanclub they're thanking
The credits are better than the movie! XD
8)
13RAWRity: central illinois, nothing but corn and soybeans for miles around
00,10so as I said, JJ is full of shit and made all this crap up after the movie tanked so hard
Shizuka: how can a movie done in SHAKY CAM have THIS many credits?
also
ILLINOIS
0,14actually, manga and ARG came out before the movie
13normal to be precise, was born there, some family still lives there
So, Shizuka...is it likely that they lived?
Shizuka: so like central NC is with Tobacco
13we visit once a year
Shizuka: Don't make fun of Central Illinois! We pride ourselves on soybeans and corn!
0,14it was an issue of the writers not carrying over the stuff to the movie
mm
seriously, watching the scrolling text and listening to the music is more entertaining than the movie.
13exactly :3
Man I remember the HYPE about this movie trailer
corn
/me turns on E.G.G.M.A.N for no reason
I mean...from all that exploshion and what's not.
theres still min of credits for the crap movie?
13and having better rain >>
11,02HEY, THIS SUMICA GUY IS TALKIN' SHIT ABOUT JJ
looking up the wiki for this movie - Hasbro made merch for a successful opening weekend - 14 inch monster w/ sound & its parasites
0,14also, the song is called ROAR! by Michael Giacchino
00,10yep
Hell there were rumors that it was VOLTRON
Shizuka: We had a good storm last night, shame you missed it.
11,02Are we talking about the pony artist JJ?
00,10FUCK JJ and all things he touches
0,14yeah, i wanted that one, Cypresswolf
SaxyPretender: it's also the fact that all this stuff? doesn't need to be explained considering the POV
13yeah there was a good system over iowa-illinois-wisconsin
13cleanly missed the twin cities though :<
0,14also also, there's 5 easter eggs in this movie
That's a shame, I was hit by it, and I loved it. :3
11,026 easter eggs if you want to get technical
NewSuperBronyU, he's talking about J. J. Abrahms
13just putting that out there now >>
hey.....um.....im the 100,000th visitor of this website
13in fact
crap in ran away
SaxyPretender: the entire POINT of having the POV be from a random uninvolved civillian is that you get into the mindset of somebody who doesn't know what's going on or why. THAT'S where there horror is supposed to come from. Explaining the monster RUINS THAT.
11,02i liek putting blue and yellow stripes on my easter egg \:3/
flutterchu: don't click it
0,14the Dharma initiative logo at the beginning, and 4 screens of classic monster movies including Godzilla and King Kong
13and spongebob
trust me flutterchu
13because...
0,14that's actually why I enjoy the movie itself aside from the ARG, RAWRity
goodbye credits, I will miss u
SaxyPretender: so it's not bad enough they made a bad, gimmicky film. They then actively took away anything unique or interesting that DID make it through.
ntfwc: I won't
and there BETTER be some post credits reveal
00,10click on it flutterchu, win your I pod nano
13nope
otakon: the credits were better than the film though
I heard something
0,14well, that was it, otakon
and now myst
pretty much RAWRity :P
wut
that's like cutting somebody's arm and then trying to bandage it by eating asparugus and peeing into their womb.
and den Sumica screwed up flutterchu's computer
otakon: Really?
0,14that little static, reversed, says "It's still alive"
13best easter egg right here
Sumica: oh....you....want me to die.....dont you Sumica
I loved that cut scene
Shizuka: How is it triggered/
*?
lol
00,10die? nah
:D
13there's like six steps all over the game, then you click something in his bedroom
it's just her playing a clip
aaaahhhhhh freska ahhhhhhh freska
why are we in a cage on irakis?
Okay.
Dear Pokemon B&W, why do you have the most exciting bike theme ever

SaxyPretender: funfact: when the phrase "It's alive" was in the first Cloverfield trailors (which were super cryptic and indirect as part of a viral marketing campaign) some thought it said "It's a lion!" and believed it was a live-action Voltron movie.

a fridge doesn't get pushed over that easily
Science_Brony: it does if theres enough friction
SCIENCE!
He'll kill your ass WITH SCIENCE!

I'm learning how to fly helicopters right now. Bill is helping emensely right now
no idea
:D
She's the only cat that never got along with the other cats. And now that I'm down to 2 cats (and the abused one is among them), the other one is starved for affection.
OUCH
bill nye doesnt explain physics, he defines them
I was just saying I was going to bed :P

Bill Nye: "Let me give you some advice. If someone is going to throw a bucket of water at your face, untuck your shirt. The reason for this is that the majority of the water will not travel down your shirt and into your trousers. I KNOW this to be true from EXPERIENCE."
:D
i wish i saw this show as a kid

Forks OF SCIENCE
husky stadium
they are rebuilding that
Very punny
oh wat
NewSuperBronyU: just the scalar center of mass?
taoumi: Yeah and that's why heh
dat Tacoma Narrows
or rather mass of center i guess
A very funny dialect, that Yoda clone did use.
...
lol
Welcome to Inception.
oh dis, i remember watching this in class
We must dig deeper.
actauly no J_E_Smith71 the university wants to make more money so they are expanding the stadium to sell mroe tickets
but balance actually wasnt why it broke
dat acting
the reason that bridge broke was because its natural frequency was the same as the winds frequency pushing on it
so it resonated
taoumi: I know it was a joke since you said they were rebuilding and they that old clip of it falling
You know, I kind of like this Pyro soundboard.
11,02twilight_sprinkle: Should be a vector since it's a coordinate, not a value.
twilight_sprinkle - it's much simpler than that
"Bridge too thin"
MirrorImage: bridges are often thin
hence, *too* thin
MirrorImage: the thicker it is, the heavier it is, though
MirrorImage: that can be a problem if its long
twilight_sprinkle - you ever tried to bend a steel bar as compared to a paperclip?
same concept
MirrorImage: you would have to build additional suppor
So terribly unpretentious.
MirrorImage: its not the same concept...
No shoes...or socks :P
No shoes at work.
yes it is - yes, you'd have to account for the weight when building the supports
Grunteld
NewSuperBronyU: there are no vectors in that equation though
but the road won't wobble like it was
Now i know!!
I remember this! This is how I learned how elevators worked! :D
Whoa, sassy :3
MirrorImage: well obviously its always better to build it with a bunch of support
Bucket head >.>
oh god
no
nader?
lard nader -_(\
just
"...Yeah, this is WAY funner."
no
...
MirrorImage: im saying that making it thicker would cost a lot
"funner"
huh
...
Grammar is not strong with the dark side of the center of gravity
okay, I'm going to try that
13that's right boys
13we're hax :3
HAX!!!!!!!!!!!
haaaaax
hax!
HAAAAAAAAAAAAX!
Boooooooooo >.>
ban girls!
HAX!
Shizuka: you girls and your hips :/
i call hax on Shizuka
twilight_sprinkle - and it wouldn't collapse then
lol girls be hax :D
13bill's got boat :3
/me is a man and about 5'7"
Shizuka is female... Hax.
So, hah :3
my chain snapped xD
LOL
11,02twilight_sprinkle: You can get a resulting vector after solving it :3
Har Har Har
wooow
that stucture is actualy fiber glass
HAX!!!!!!!!!!!
MirrorImage: probably not, but its not always necessary, an optimal solution for price, weight, support was made, because of that resonance situation it broke
yay song
13i didn't have a chain snap.. though i did have the rear derailleur shatter once
13that was a fun walk home >>
tools --> minecraft
twilight_sprinkle -yes, but my point is that if the roadway / road beams were thicker, it wouldn't be moving quite so much
I'm back. Stupid f*cking chair . . .
the road itself would absorb more of the force, rather than all the structural supports
yes, the resonance caused the collapse, but only because the road wasn't build thick enough to absorb it
i wish my bike still worked
Science_Brony: Just in time for the song OF SCIENCE
Petrified_Discord yay~
which goes back to my "steel bar vs paperclip" analogy
MirrorImage: well they tried to optimize it, and it didnt work out
i would point tword wikipedia but it would get yelled at
13wasn't it also because the trusses were solid, so the air had to push against the road bed?
there you go Shizuka
puns
13that's what i remember, the resonance built up because the air couldn't flow around the bridge so the wind kept pushing it
im drinking chocolate milk the milk is powderd with sugar in it
*puns* --> *falls down* ...
aeroelastic flutter
all you need to add to powder milk is water and stir it
Bill Nye: "Some people say that sleeping out under a full moon will cause you to go crazy. Now, I've slept under plenty of full moons. Do I seem crazy to you? HUH? DO I?!"
Shizuka: if the air couldnt flow it wouldnt oscillate though, it wouldve just pushed it to a side if i understand what youre saying
what are we talking about?
transitionnnnn~
Science_Brony: the collapse of a bridge that was shown
ah
And there goes the bar again
And another number added to the pile. It ain't over yet
must've missed it
more transitions!
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING.
so this is amnesia?
ah, here we go

What is this? ANd who is streaming?
ew
i feel bad for all the sprite i ever drank now
TheRandomkid321: Bill Nye, streamed by Shizuka
TheRandomkid321 Bill Nye the Science Guy - Garbage. Shizu's streaming
I assumed it was Bill Nye.
you made a correct assumption
BILL NUYE THE APERTURE SCIENCE GUY
the pony in the corner is missing so you can't tell right away
13fair warning, compost piles REEK
nye*
YES
Shizuka ugh, tell me about it
Suddenly LAG!
Shizuka - maybe it's just my local compost pile, but i actually find the smell rather fruity
smelly science
taoumi: Well you can tell Shizuka's streaming because she has the little numbered status bar at the bottom
taoumi:i know when shizukas streaming because of the little video thing on the bottum of the screen
Yeah. KMPlayer IIRC.
J_E_Smith71 - and because each time we say "Shizuka," it goes "ba-ding"
>_>
13pings shouldn't actually be getting through >>
13unless they do when i have line 1 on for soundboaring
Shizuka

srsly.. that name. fresh kills
She's also one of the mods who sometimes streams TF2, but she hasn't lately.
13HIPPY ALERT
SPIRIT JOURNEY TIME
I LIKE HIPPIES!
She did some Trackmania United Forever the other day. Hey Shizuka, have you made a Mania Zone yet?
not all hippies
13nope
but i love every hippie in the world
now they have mukelshoot casino
not really XD
oh god
13oh the 90s
-_(\
TAYKATDATRAYAYASHA
13they're going to be the future... kid there are soooooo many more ways they're hosed than garbage buildup
rly
13cause we've pretty much got garbage down to a science, garbage compacts easily
VAN DYKE XD
luna!
13taking all garbage in the US into one big landfill would be like 100 miles square if i remember right
Yep that 90s heavy save the world environment stuff
what a shame
I read something similar too, Shizuka
13that's why how it's made recycles plastic
plastic plastic plastic
bill nye mustve discovered many wonderful smells during this episode
and then they went back to celulose base plastics that will biodegrade
13yep, run out of places, planet's kind of big bill
night everypony, got school tomorrow ;3;
the first plastics were actualy celulose. then they found petro lwas so much cheeper
nite thelonepony
Good night, thelonepony
Night, thelonepony. :)
i say we build a giant cannon that fires trash into the sun
bye thelonepony
My mom and I recycle. Every other Tuesday, I lay about 5+ bags of plastic, metal, and paper on the front lawn to be picked up for recycling.
play them off johnny
Family Guy was not first :D
no shit
Err, yeah. No fucking shit.
did somebody mention BP?
we should make a giant ball then use our mob ties to buy a rocket and fire it into space
i recycled when i lived on campus
13was it the EPA that did that three Rs thing.. cause god that was EEEEVERYWHEEERE in the 90s
inb4RainbowDashCutieMark
EEEEEPAAAA
i AM AN ADULT
13this kid so grows up to be a brony
13we all know it
lol
Recycle, Reduce, Reuse, and close the loop we can close the loop
"Reduce. Reuse. Recycle. Die."
Oh god I remember those ads
Shizuka it was EEEEEEEVERYWHEEEERE long after the 90's
"If don't be kind to Mother Nature she'll kick our butts!"
Basically, rainbow is light.
Die. FOR SCIENCE
Light is part of SCIENCE!
13that's why we burn it
i havent thrown out a bottle in months, i just reuse the one i have
i keep my soada bottles to put achohol in
now all of a sudden, the only thing I can think about is John Ritter telling me to recycle :D
but i only drink tap water though
mostly that is
I know this name
:D
close your mouth
I go through a couple bottles everyday since I don't trust the water on my job site.
13and then how it's made shows us they can chew up huge piles of tires for a whooole lot of new rubber
eeyup
Man, I hate being downwind of people who burn leaves. I can't air out the house when the air gets all smoky.
klobb: back when i lived in a dorm, i didnt trust the water there either, so i boiled it
mmmm
13recycle antifreeze... where exactly?
Shizuka - local auto part store could probably tell you
dogs do sadly
No facilities?
put that anti freeze back in your car, and recycle it
You dispose of car waste at service stations.
i think most of them have at least some kind of large vat for used motor oil
owaw
13we drink it raw?
nuuu it killed plankton
damn bill
13bill, it's called city tap, we invented it for a reason >>
owaw, hes actually swimming in garbage
So coffee?
not sure if dubstep or Stomp
Can anyone tell me what the winners of the lottery this week are?
13frosted CORN SHARDS
stomp
Corn Shards
aww yeah! aww I was just starting to jam :(
13at least little boxes like that are pretty dead
"If you're going to cut your mouth, do it with Corn!"
The only other people on my street who recycle live far down the street from me. Everyone else has overflowing dumpsters every Thursday.
I generate about one kitchen bag of garbage a week.
I havent seen those little cereal boxes in ages
DocSane: I actually can't remember, but I know for B we have a three hour TV movie followed by Return of Harmony both parts, so it'll be a long one
Cypresswolf: Same here.
13i think we average two a week, plus a full can of recycling
just to spite this brat, i;m going to only use little boxes
i want cerial now -.-
lol
also
A three hour TV movie?
that's one giant ass box
Moon goes woosh
DocSane: Yep.
I loved getting a 10 pack - eat my favorite cereals first :) and the rest just sat on the counter collecting dust
hello
So where is the fetus?
hi DaringDerpy
13VAC why you stuttering...
AJIsAwesome: Now I'm intrigued.
Hi, DaringDerpy. :)
Space Oddessy 2000?
hi DaringDerpy

Kandarihu - Honey Boo Boo.
Okay, I need to wake up in four hours. Jury duty tomorrow. Wish me luck that I get released at noon, folks.
wasnt the same as the odyssey song(which is actually from strauss maybe? dont remember), me thinks they changed it a bit to avoid copyright
DocSane: Kung Fu Hustle and The Color of Magic
your argument is invalid

DAT PYRO
*boop*
13problem is this is pretty much the only bill nye song i remembered before getting this torrent .-.
It had animated recycle products in the shape of the letters
13it's awful..
yeah MirrorImage not funny
Is anypony here (besides the mods) old enough to remember when commercials were interesting?
twilight_sprinkle - hence my point?
Honey Boo Boo is a disgrace to television and it never should've existed. It should've even been PLANNED.
i live in Pennsylvania anyways
:D Pyro
Good to know Pyro is into it.
Is that NewSuperBronyU in the background?
*SHouldn't
There was also that Rocko episode. "R-E-C-Y-C-LE Recycle, C-O-N-S-E-R-V-E Conserve..."
Science_Brony, I still find some commercials interesting.
dat pyro yell
AJIsAwesome: Yeah; well, the bar has been lowered pretty low, can't get much worse then this.
13OOOOOOOO HE SAID A BAD WORD
i heard that
what did he say?
13blew the take and muttered 'shit'
lol
Honey Boo Boo exists because shows like Diamonds & Tiaras are being watched
I feel bad for those children.
Toddlers & Tiaras
AJIsAwesome: The worst part of it all is the fact that show is on TLC... TLC of all channels...
Silver_Soother: I know.....*sigh*....
Cypresswolf :D
does we get jurneyman?
oh boi
Penn and Teller
I love Bullshit. :D
penn and teller?
heh
Okay, too bad we get mixed messages.
Please; tell me, where did you get this?
TLC really went downhill :| The Learning Channel? :D there's nothing worth learning about on that channel anymore
13i've had the torrent for months
13luna streamed some earlier this year
"/
Okay, I guess I just dont know how to internet. xD
:O Bacon too fatty? NEVER!
lugnuts?
bacon is . . . meh
So much love for Teller. <3
I'm instantly loving this :)
13is the baby really necessary in the shot
Cypresswolf: As you should, it's an awesome show. They still have a version of this on Discovery last I knew of.
the baby is to prove she's a Real Mom
Shizuka: Gotta get her baby out there somehow.
13yeah i think they ended after season 8 or so, then moved to a new thing
13it's got what plants crave?
Eight seasons of this bullshit? :3
that wasteful ass
That poor guy...
13yep
an entire bag of food
who does that
13might do some more next time :)
Shizuka yes, it's to show that she is a caring mother. It's also to draw attention. Baby = "cute". "Cute" = views.
So?
Is there an episode on this about anthropogenic climate change?
it's a gimmick
"More people recycle than vote" - that's because a lot of places make recycling a law, unlike voting
13i think so, i'll check
Kandarihu: Yes, there is.
13there's a general one about environmentalism
13that one's pretty good
night everypony
I dont recycle - the trash end up in the city dump anyway, let them city folk sort it out

what the flying fuck
we have a garbage chute on every floor. all the trash goes into a non-transparent plastic bag and down there
Science_Brony - "Will it leave a mark on your clothing? Yes/No"
Yeah, use bullshit to denounce bullshit :P
now if we had that many trash cans in every house
13penn, what have you created... YOU'VE DOOMED US ALL
Then again, it is proving a point
in the end, they burn it all in the same power plant anyway
Always bothered me the fact it took me 5 seconds to throw away from trash. Instead, give me an hour to deal with trash. Eeyup....
4chan is complete rubbish
How do you know that, Dj_Cyber-4G?
because it's 4chan
requires no explanation
were you there for the war? i think not!
Didn't bronydom start at 4chan?
it did
My problem here is that even if we accept the problems of recycling as they show them, it doesn't really justify throwing things we could recycle in the landfills.
or whatever
you probably heard of it
local grocery store parking lot used to have a can crushing machine - that was taken out in around 95 - dont think there are any left now
be careful when you say "bronydom started at 4chan"
pony_1066, I agree
YEAH IN THE WAR THE BRONY'S WERE CREATED... that doesn't make 4chan any better
too many people automatically assume 4chan = /b/
Yeah, that was not the fault of 4chan. I should not have to let you know that there are people behind those keyboards.
people just prefer to go to LE REDDIT XDXD and such because they can't handle people disagreeing with them
13our can crusher actually broke >>
and being honest
MirrorImage?
13LELELELELELELELELE
we created ourselves out of the dust
those old can crushers are harder to find than phone booths]
if you keep starting from scratch, youll run out of material and places to store the garbage
DaringDerpy - a lot of people will use 4chan and /b/ - slash - anonymous interchangeably
All these people are saying is bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
:) I used to fill some of those old cans with sand to make them weigh more so we got more change back
Polydunami that's why they call the show "Penn and Teller: Bullshit"
well...it was /co/...the wars on /b/ did their part too
Yes. Paper and wood are renuable resources. Yet most of the recycling I do IS paper
more political nonsience
Earth isn't an entirely closed system--we do get some energy from the sun, but hardly enogh to offset what we waste, nor do we have the space to just keep throwing more energy into landfills.

woot
Science_Brony, I fail to see the humor in a freezeframe without a buffer circle
As for this paper bit--the problem isn't just cutting down old trees . . . because, it's cutting down old-growth trees because such trees are part of old-growth forests, which are important to the environment in general. Tree farms are in no way an acceptable replacement for a forest that's been around longer than the human race.
13now and then it gets stuck in a CPU bottleneck
Kandarihu did you not see the buffer circle?
13didn't buffer, just paused while i poked around
oh
Take care, everyone. :)
ok, ignore me
Kandarihu: Unless the streamer pauses and backs up on purpose so we can cap a funny face
putting people in threadmills for energy production can create millions of jobs
and it's eco friendly too
13and we don't cause it's a monumental waste of effort better put to better tasks
A dirty job is worse than no job? Mike Rowe would like to speak with you.

trash energy works.... it's suuuper stanky though
wait i mustve msised something, how is it worse for the environment
:O
/me licks TheRandomkid321 :P
13i love bait and switch jokes like that :3
Science_Brony: who are you talking to?
AdamTheDuck... ew.... i'm used to it though
pony_1066 myself, as usual
i thought it was going to end up with biat. but .....
Science_Brony: We all end up background noise at some point. :3
How the governemt works.
it doesn't
so what exactly is ther big solution, just ignore everything and be wasteful?
13there it is
13oh... i wasn't even close with my estimate
twilight_sprinkle: they don't feel a need to provide solutions--they just bitch at the things people are trying.
it's pandora
:3
taoumi: Indeed. Lol.
taoumi I was just playing Borderlands 2 :D
I'd like to show this to my mother sometimes, but the f word makes this a no-sell.
that is so true
pony_1066: the people trying do it with other people's money
13penn's pretty hard libertarian, the problem with government funded makework is it's government funded makework
...then again, maybe she might be able to bear it for this.
13that's taking money away from consumers that would otherwise be put to uses the market actually wants
ie roads
DaringDerpy: I would rather waste money trying than save money by trying nothing--nothing ventured, nothing gained.
13well... government is DAMN good at wasting money
^^^^
At the very least you could learn how to do it better.
^^
13see solyndra and a slew of other green job failures >>
money is Supposed to be wasted on these things
WHAT? It all gets buried?
yeah it could be better
but life isnt about eating up all the money you can
13no it isn't, money is a method of transferring effort to goods
pony_1066 you would waste resources for nothing...that's the opposite of efficiency or green
...power from decomposing garbage? ...AWESOME!
13taking money and diverting it to things the market doesn't actually want has vastly worse consequences down the line
material that is worth being recycled gets recycled. the rest can be burned
He;;s not kidding those landfills really do burn methane for power
MANDATORY
Shizuka: like i said, it Could be better, but if its helping even slightly, with something as important as the world ecology, it should be done. yeah it could be improved, bnut im not sure i believe this show
DaringDerpy: It's not wasted if you learn from failure.
13the collective might of millions of humans is more efficient than the decree of a few politicians
Assuming it fails.
trash for the trash god
twilight_sprinkle - it turns out going naked 24/7 is helpful for the environment.
But... decomposing garbage gets... recycled into Methane gas.
would you do it?
13but also, everyone should be required to read this http://steshaw.org/economics-in-one-lesson/
pony_1066: it's wasted if you failed because you didn't do the math before
@Shizuka: who exactly do you think does what politcians decree?
MirrorImage: why
It's not the community who betrayed her.
13people who are threatened with fines or jailtime if they don't comply
13who do YOU think does it?
DaringDerpy: It's wasted even more if you don't do anything with it at all.
^
^^
obviusly the government isnt being honest
twilight_sprinkle - think about it. less water wasted on laundry. less factory work making the clothing. less wasted materials that could be used for other things.
13no see you're thinking in zero sum terms
THIS
Oh thank you Shiz
pony_1066: so brainless actionism?
The ep about swaering!
THIS is one of my favourites
but since we cant do anything about it unless we go into politics, we should at least spend the money to slightly improve the ecology
:D
you know... this might be the first night i actually go to bed before Shizuka...
BURN
We go from Trash to Spongbob Trash talking
working off the clock
more trash tv?
MirrorImage: ...really
Night night bstate!
MirrorImage: and how would we live during the winter
Good night, Panda
@Shizuka: You're right. Everything ever mandated by the government is done by prisoners. Sounds legit.

g'night Panda|Sleepies
Night Panda|Sleepies
Krabs is a FUCKWITR
you kiss your mouth with that mother?

good night Panda|Sleepies
13pony_1066: don't pay your taxes for a while and then tell me it's voluntary to pay for wasteful government programs
Krabs is a dolphin
you know for kids
Sentence enhancer? Like Entenze for your grammar?
twilight_sprinkle - it was mostly a rhetorical point
LOVEING FUCKIN DAY
and I exit on tax evasion XD
i don't have an option to pay pay my taxes. it gets pulled out of my check
/me noms twilight_sprinkle
wow
Shizuka: its better to waste it on these things than on pointless luxury
just wow
/me nomz Panda|Sleepies ^.^
13twilight_sprinkle: so you know how better to spend my money than i do?
MirrorImage: okay
13that's pretty much diametrically opposed to what the country was founded on
twilight_sprinkle: pointless luxury like bronystate?
DaringDerpy: No, just action over inaction. no one else did anything as far as I know. At least someone is trying in this regard.
Shizuka: idk, im saying for the average person. basically i msaying that even if inefficient, its still a worth ycause
HOW THE FUCK ARE YA!?
Sad fact of life: I swear more in one day than all the swears heard total in this episode.
dem kids
13pony_1066: inaction in something you're focusing on, but it becomes action in something else that otherwise wouldn't get done
I expect that kind of talk from Denny's but this place?
DaringDerpy: i dont spend money it
pony_1066: as I said, actionism for the sake of actionism.
fuck fuck fuckity fuck
:D Im surprised Nick allowed this after getting Angry Beavers cancelled for saying "shutup"
@Shizuka: I'm an anarchist--I don't think government si the best way for humans to live. But unless you have a magical solution, I'll bear with it for now.
*breaks out Happy Snacks*
DaringDerpy: also dont worry, i dont buy games or movies
13mmm anarchists
WOA IM LATE!!!! GOODBYE EVERYPONY SEE YOU ALL TOMMOROW!

It's funny that Derpy caused such an uproar, but not this

Mekrob
I can think of 8
13there's an l in there somewhere..
was that a George Carlin reference? :3
13well you have the canonical seven from carlin
DaringDerpy: If someone were developing a better plan, I'd like to see it. Otherwise, complaining seems like an exercise in bitching.
13sort of, as i recall he has fuck and motherfucker, which is a bit redundant
It's dangerous to confuse libertarians with anarchists. In the face of overbearing government, it's hard to tell the difference, though.
Hello everypony!! :)
pony_1066: you don't get it

hi Ponyloverforever
ahh George Carlin, probably my favorite comedian ever
DaringDerpy: Apparently not.
pony_1066: anarchy wouldnt let people develop, l=plus i suspect people would band together and control others anyway
Hey there, Ponyloverforever
Hello Ponyloverforever
mornin' everypony
13anarchy offers the least amount of freedom because you are always focused on protecting your own property
And hello SirGanjalf :P
Morning SirGanjait
13those with the biggest guns gather the power and you end up in a monarchy
:D
Troll dice
this is me when i play TF2]
hello Ponyloverforever and SirGanjalf
:D
you said the bluluva
anarchy is unstable. you can see it in every slum of the world. gangs deliver security and take political power quite fast
hi SirGanjalf
This is me when I play anything:p
twilight_sprinkle @Shizuka I'm glad both of you noticed that I'm content with the current system. Besides, the anarchy I think of is not the anarchy you are thinking of.
13dat face
:D
Screenshotted
woah
13favorite part of the episode there
pony_1066: nobody likes the current system, it should get a kick in the ass
13dammit vac...
I' ll cap it after wards
J_E_Smith71 this is an average conversation when I'm not around parents, teachers, my sister, and the like.
Shizuka: http://i.imgur.com/fHL2W.png
he said some things <_<
13wish i knew why it starts derping like that..
twilight_sprinkle: I said content, not liking.
So the Valve Anti Cheating is CPU spiking?
DADADADADDADADA
Spectrum_Rush - "GASP! Who said they don't like ponies?"
pony_1066: i know, im agreeing :P
This is anarchism in its proper form, not that nonsense the media has impressed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism
pony_1066: imo the main problem of the world right now is peoples' egoism and how they put their own wellbeing above all else
Never mind seems Spectrum_Rush somehow knows how to get them fast before I can
00,10derping how Shizuka?
13starts stuttering like that
no stutter on our end
00,10oh
Is it never going to be revealed?
13least i assume it goes through to... wow really?

13unless maybe it's windows' forwarding from line 1 to speakers, whereas fmle is taking line 1 directly
DaringDerpy: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL!! 0.0
:D
it's the elder swear
:[
:O
pony_1066: proper form? anarchism is not a sect.
:D
So how did they know the other 12?
I think i'll reinstall TF2 before Halloween, cause error reports are gettin unbearable
00,10would depend alot on the set up Shizuka
J_E_Smith71 it's Spongebob.
such a scream of ***************** have i ever heard in my days
13kmplayer goes to line 1 via directsound, windows copies line 1 to speaker output, fmle takes line 1 directly
. . . why am I still on SCIENCE(!!!)?
13i don't use the repeater
But she was not all dead :P
that's better
13old people know the more classic swears
agagagaga
There was another cappable bit
That one isn't on the list even.
DaringDerpy: Yes, it is. Anarchy has many different divisions and shades. It's not simply chaos.
:D
o.o
wHooaAAAAaa
Welp
00,10no need to use the repeater if you have win 7 unless you want to talk on stream Shizuka *snicker*
thanks for stream
That was a great stream, Thanks Shizuka :)
tnx Shizuka :)
trippyyyy
And this concludes our Shizuka broadcast day
And this is the part where we all say THANKS SHIZUKA :3
13there, just started stuttering here
thx for the stream Shizuka
00,10now i hear it
I always get a bit sad when I hear this music. Thanks for the stream Shizuka :D
yeah, I have stutter
00,10that is a sound overflow
I hear static.
Bedtime for me - Goodnight
clear now
13hm.. any fix?
g'night Cypresswolf
13yeah clear now
Thanks for streaming Shizuka :3
Thank you for the stream Shizuka
Shizuka: thanks for the stream
Shizuka much better
Goodnight Cypresswolf
00,10too much data and it's fillinf the buffer
13hm
thanks for another awesome stream Shizuka
Thank ya Shizuka, espically for running Sailor Mouth there
thanks shizuka for teh stream ^^
pony_1066: you can label everything you want "Anarchism". doesn't change anything. in the end only one question is relevant: "who makes the decisions?"
Sumica: Are you going to be streaming next?
00,10tends to happen if you have alot of things runing or you run low on memory
Thank you Shizuka for the always awesome stream.
13definitely not low on memory, 5 of 8GB free
00,10I belive NewSuperBronyU is next
thanks Shizuka
Sumica: Okay. :) Thanks.
13cpu's about 30% across six cores
13pretty standard
Sailor Mouth. To an old school anime fan, that brings up very very creepy mental images.
Shizuka, THANK YOU for the stream. You had me ever since I came back when that Rifftrax of the movie I'd rather see non-riffed was over.
dat hex core
00,10but mostly it's just VAC is wonky
hi Phase4
Shizuka, try ffsplit :P
13still need to look into that...
And of course you have the PPG episode like the Spongebob one where they learned to curse
00,10i recomend after you finish Shizuka you disable the vac cables in sound
13will probably do that when back from illinois
00,10then restart the vac driver
Anyways, I'm hitting the hay.
This was preceded by Tiny Toon Adventures, you know.
G'night everypony!

Night Canadian_Brony :)
Polydunami: Oh yeah Foulmouth
yep, i agree

later folks

Aww....
Yeah, Fowlmouth :D
And here's the Rocko recycle song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEpG3UsKv54

Goodngiht Canadian_Brony
lol dat sleepy rarity ^_^
dat rarity :3
nite cana
dat sleepyface
Kencolt, ROFL
That is one cute marshmellow...
dat dat
lol
Rarity just moved up a rank in my book
DaringDerpy: Depends on which form of anarchism you're looking at. You could have individualist anarchy, fairly self-explanatory. But there's also collectivist anarchy, where voluntary associations come together to make these decisions.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hUXsfU14Sc have some music
The Sailor Senshi of Planet Mouth
And since I got cut off here's the Space Jump Chat Reactions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-moUvLG2Nes
DaringDerpy: And since you seem to have such a bone with it, for the record, once again, I don't think anarchy is anywhere near feasible at the moment.
:3 http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/171/mallow.png
pony_1066: that's all voodoo theory, most of it was never touched by people with even basic social sciences education.
Rarity mirrors my own sleepyness :D Good morning Bronystate!
DaringDerpy: I think anarchism is only possible in a completely post-scarcity society.
anarchism is possible whereever central authority fails.
pony_1066, anarchy is the complete absence of government. It's impossible to dictate specific varients within that scenario, since it's all chaos.
but it doesn't last
/me wonders if NewSuperBronyU passed out
/me pokes NewSuperBronyU
Sumica: He is building up suspense.
oi u awake
Kandarihu: No, it's the absence of the state--an absence of rulers. Not the same.
<3
DaringDerpy: Let me rephrase--I think it's only feasible in a post-scarcity society.
/me is in bed with SB >///>
Well, it's still the absence of whatever determines and maintains the structure of the laws. So whoever is quickest to sieze power becomes the new rulers.
and I think it's not at all. there is no post scarcity in power and influence. there will always be conflicts between humans
Kandarihu: What power is there to seize in a post-scarcity society?
13physical property will always have some amount of scarcity attached
13until we figure out how to conjure materials from thin air
If you can destroy the goods distribution channels, you control them. And everyone dependent on them.
00,10nanotech and relecaters
Awww I missed Shizustream :(
One might note tha those who seek power for power's sake-- and such have sadly always existed-- could artificially create scarcity.
MadSurge, it was an awesome stream.
@Shizuka: When I say post-scarcity, I mean COMPLETELY post-scarcity. Land is also a non-issue, so obviously such a society would need to be space-faring. Or be capable of building massive ships.
ok guys, my eyes are getting heavy so i shall see yall again whe i awaken ^_^ night guys
and galls
It's okay, MadSurge. Some of it was bullshit anyway :3
Goodnight NocturnalBlade
Good night, NocturnalBlade
Kencolt, that seems to be the EPA's only real function, to create scarcity.
13you can't be completely post-scarcity, there is a finite amount of matter in the universe, and a miserably tiny fraction of it within humanity's reach
good night NocturnalBlade
there are however hints to creating matter from energy
Kandarihu: Being a Republican, I have to admit it certainly seems that way at times. I've no doubt they are well intentioned-- just not well operated.
@Shizuka: A miserably tiny amount of the universe is an awful lot. Besides, it doesn't need to be infinite, it only needs to be limitless.
/me hugs AdamTheDuck Polydunami and DaringDerpy :)
:)
bye NocturnalBlade
pony_1066, doesn't need to be infinite, just without a finite limit :P
maybe we will see commercial terawatt fusion reactors in our lifetime. cheap energy means cheap everything. but there are still limits. nothing is infinite
Sumica willl you be streaming if NewSuperBronyU doesnt?
13see... earth is the only planet we know of that can naturally sustain life, anything else will require either massive construction (supported by limited resources at home) or terraforming (also supported by limited resources at home)
I do believe I am calling it a night now. Sleep well my pony folk, like young Rarity is. ;)
/me hugs twilight_sprinkle
Kencolt, but how was it well-intentioned to declare Co2 a pollutant? Even though plants depend on it to produce our O2?
twilight_sprinkle: last theory of the creation of the univeRSE I heard was that it actually did emerge from nothing. Has to do with the state of virtual particles and how they simultaneously exist and don't exist.
/me bows and takes his leave
night Silver_Soother
OH BOY Retsupururae made a video about Pewdiepie :D
Kandarihu, Cobalt?
Kandarihu: They seem to be worried about "excess" CO2. How they define excess is still something of a mystery to me.
pony_1066: there are many theories, none have been completely proven
13co2 is a pollutant, everyone stop breathing right now
/me holds his breath :<
gaia smiles
ok Shizuka but im leaving a note taht it was you who killed me
I died.
13i want to know the metric of how much co2 we put out as part of manufacturing etc compared to the sum total exhalations of every aerobic organism on the planet
@Shizuka: So? For like the fourth bleeding time now, I do not think it is currently possible, this is all theory. I am anarchist at heart, for now I just settle for libertarianism.
00,10it's ok Shizuka I have this peice of paper that says it's ok for me to polute a bit
Kencolt, a lefty who I met on another IRC network basically told me that deforestation is now the new world-destroying environmental epidemic.
13Sumica: give you two buds for it :3
00,10wooooo
00,10got to love carbon vouchers
twilight_sprinkle: It's hard to prove something happened 14 billion years ago. We just need a theory that fits the model.
00,10especaly how they are on paper.
00,10it's like ironic
Shizuka: http://www.spin.de/forum/msg-archive/16/2010/02/272882
pony_1066: yeh
humans produce 2 billion tons per year, combustion and industry 31 million tons
13just a wee bit short :3
I'm off. See you all later. :)
night pony_1066
oh wait...31 billion tons
well... streamless, and it is getting very late... laters.
bye ken
Hoo boy. Cap & Trade. We gotta be on the lookout for that.
its 31 million
if chrome is translating right
13yeah millionen is million
he corrected it one post later
13i seem to recall german uses the milliard == billion convention but we didn't really focus on numbers that high
Do you know how easy it would be for a human to breathe when in the middle of a thick leafy forest? That's how a tree feels in the middle of human industry.
I just stumbled over a site with people who do yoga do lower their co2 production...
humans are idiots...
I don't even do yoga :S
The solution to excess CO2 is simple. PLANT MORE TREES!
Besides, what comes in, must go out.
Shizuka: Italian uses milliards
Actually, scratch that last comma :S
13milliard was brit usage for a while too but slowly moved to billion, as far as i know
In other words, became obsolete.
Archaic, even
NewSuperBronyU, Ping
NewSuperBronyU, Ping Ping
Shizuka: same. Thank god for the Internet :D
13true dat
/me helps Phase4 by licking NewSuperBronyU :P
/me lives in Vancouver. Lots of culture here :3
He's ded, Jim. :|
english million, billion, trillion
Well, billiard is not obsolete in English.
It's a heck of a lot of fun, though :3
*too
Polydunami, lol.
/me 13hasn't played pool in years...
I just won 10$ off my father..
13was vaguely competent at it.. virtual pool with tracer lines does actually help you line things up in reality, assuming you can hit straight >>
Kandarihu: I like excess co2. imagine a green, fertile canada. green antarctica.
I remeber there was Pool game show where contestants had to do elaborate pot shots...
it was on the Beeb
Why are we talking aout pool now?
13was french wasn't it? saw a clip of something like that where a guy clears three tables with one shot
because pool
milliard=billion in russian too
sup yall
no it was definately British
hoi Moopy
Hoi
Uhh, hate to break it to you, but the Canada I'm familiar with is quite green.
where it matters, we use x*10^y anyway
they may haev copied the french though..
so whats going on here?
13might have been british, i might just be confusing multiple clips
Heck, we have a bog here.
DaringDerpy: everyone uses that, its scientific notation
yes
Polydunami: except the white parts.
13Kandarihu: TREEEEE? I AM NO TREEEEEEEE, I AM AN ENT
13:3
Kandarihu the funny thing is.... they use O2 at mnight time.
In other words, not where I live.
they steal out air
our
Oh, right. Yeah. Suicidal Ents
13Polydunami: probably a good moderating effect from the pacific
Seriously, I live in Vancouver. We don't usually get a lot of snow.
anyway im out, bye
*they respire at night
Moderating?
13i'm sure.....whichever province is north of minneota, manitoba i think... is a horrible place in winter
Hmm, I never heard about that.
sea climate, Polydunami
yep it fucking rocks
13considering international falls mn barely gets above freezing like half the year
Hey guess what my mom told me to not to stay up late but im doing it anyway
Yeah, my grandmother had plenty of stories of her hometown of wintery Winnipeg
Few horrible blizzards, tornadoes, storms...
Yeah, we have an island to the west of us.
Still, a sea climate.
/me 13misses illinois climate so much
13warm summers that catch the big rain bands that move through all the time, mild winters that don't force you into hibernation for six months
Well, I hope you' enjoy the snow, Shizuka. I loved it when I lived in Michigan. I missed it when I lived in Alabama. I only get traces of it in Tennessee.
What's new?
13moved up here from arizona when i was 10... sure at first it was YAY SNOW AGAIN
1312 years later... snow can go melt >>
It was white here for 3 whole days... this winter
Aw
13was cold as hell but last winter was relatively mild snow-wise
Well, look at us ponies talking about the weather :3
sounds like it was just dry then
Damn, I forgot the words :S
13so that's... political ideology > CO2 > millions milliard billions billiard > pool > weather
13bronystate!
YEAH!!!!
FUCK YEAH
13Moopy: six >>
lol
That pretty much summed up this conversation.
13when halloween night is routinely a couple degrees above freezing >>
Shizuka: so wait, are you conservative or liberal? I wasn't looking .__.
But FREE CANDY!
o.O
'Die hard commie' i think....
13i tend to fall on the right side, couple things i'm not thrilled with the more hard line republican stances but that puts me more in the libertarian category than anything
But don't eat to much candy or you will get sick
/me is definately me
*one
cool to hear the Shizuka
Yeah, I know about savouring each and every bite
Yeah. I'm kind of that way too.
/me wants to try balut some day :3
Shizuka: as long as you're not racist and an idiot, I don't care, we can meet half-way :)
13tbh i generally set my alarm to wake me up to rush, but more because my brain just can't stand to sleep in during OPEN LIIIIINE FRIIIDAAAAAAY
13that is when i'm actually using my alarm, otherwise i just follow /r/libertarian and filter out the OMGTWOPARTYNOTFAIR
13also "upon sighting a tank" http://i.imgur.com/iMhVO.jpg
13coach's face looks more like he sees a tank made of chocolate
Dang it, now I'm salivating :D
13aha, /r/mylittlepony finally delivers http://i.imgur.com/QFPPG.jpg
So somebody actually jumped from space?
13yep, 120k ft, 38km
I mean, and not burn up as well?
13yep
13i think it's mid stratosphere, shuttle reentry is a couple dozen more km up i think
Well, that must have been an alright day for that person.
Polydunami: Yeah we saw the thing here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-moUvLG2Nes
13think it was.. just under 5 minutes of freefall, took ten minutes to land once he popped his chute
11,02o3o
suddenly NewSuperBronyU
00,10clearly they did it wrong Shizuka
00,10the 2 hours to reach altitude
00,10next time strap his ass to a rocket
Sumica, Ah, the kerbal method
Yeah, you could play entire "Free falling" while he was... free falling:P
00,10would have been an intersting exparamnt Shizuka
SirGanjalf, it would finish and you'd still be falling
00,10just seeing waht happend to a marshmellow when he poped the hatch
Shizuka, but how would he eat it, theres a helmet in the way
Phase4: Then i would play Guile's Theme
13Phase4: worked for patrick
XD
13patrick to spongebob, i like going *kssh* over
SirGanjalf: Free falling? Is that a song?
13yeah it's a thing
eeyuo
13van halen's Jump would also have been appropriate
*eeyup
^
13sort of... as i recall it's actually a more morbid song about telling a suicide jumper to... well jump .-.
Who's the artist?
Shizuka, but its such an upbeat song

13let me double check
J_E_Smith71: Free falling - Tom Petty
Oh dear. I must've been out at Wal-Mart when that was going on
Dang it,, since my video had no sound YouTube's offering me a song suggestion. I'm looking up Free Fall but I don't see that Tom Petty one there
J_E_Smith71: There's also a cover by John Mayer
Then again that's a 4:30 song and my vid's like 19 minutes so I don't know where to fit it in
The jump last longer than the song doesn't it?
13"David Lee Roth has given various accounts of the meaning behind the lyrics, but he usually says they are about a TV news story he saw where a man was about to kill himself by jumping off a building (Roth thought, "Might as well jump"). He's also said the song is about a stripper."
