Good morning fillies and gentlecolts
/me is no longer away : Gone for 7 hours 43 minutes 18 seconds
i knew someone was gonna say dat lol
10Heyo Snuffsis!
mornin Snuffsis
ok, so if i buy portal 2 on steam do i allso get it on ps3?
10,02You need to buy it on PS3 first
10,02Then you get it free on Steam
ah, k
Epic fight tiem
that never happened before, lol
HEY he said that in the first one
Oooh, awesome. SMG... 2 is it?
:D
yep
YES
and then for a second it LOOKED like a N64 game
mfw portal for ps3 is CHEAPER from a local retailr
Nice.. who's streaming?
Snuffsis: eeyup
That fight was SO HARD
Snuffsis: SuperBrony64
wait, nvm. miscounted
its $6 more
which is worth it imho
SuperBrony64. i wub woo so much now! <3
it's so shiny @_@ MY EYES
lol
Honestly, you should get Portal 2 Phase 4, it's so damn good
Wrex would totaly be a brony
Snuffsis: played it, second best game ever!
dat hax
Does anyone here play Wakfu?
Snuffsis: best is portal 1
I like Portal 1 and 2 for different reasons though.
^
is true
Portal 1 is a much better puzzle game, Portal 2 has a much better story.
Good night everypony
10,02Night CupcakeWarrior
night CupcakeWarrior
that SMW music
:D
nightCupcakeWarrior
Snuffsis: i dont think they should make a portal 3, but more puzles for 2 would be excelent
Goodnight cupcakewarrior
I'd rather have Half-life 3 sometime in the near future. xD
10I'm heading off everyone, gonna go get ready for lectures. Cya SuperBrony64 <333
wait, if you go through the fire do you warp or die?
10,02Later RainBroDash ^_^
10,02Good luck :3

10thank you.
Have fun and learn a lot Rainbrodash
bye RainBroDash!
Later RainBroDash

c ya rainbro
SuperBrony64: nice save
that was close SB
I see no ponies
Yoshi is close
datz a YOSHI
Yoshi is dino pony
i've allso got uni, had 2 lectures and a lab today. if anyone is wondering wether or not to go, do it
uni is awesome
A dino pony?
You mean like piccolo?
bye RainBroDash
Yoshi is great
Yoshi is clearly from Namek
Hells Yeah
I can see yoshi being in ponyville
^
lol
Yoshi isn't a namekian. >:(
Dashie_Dashie: mfw Yoshi loses an eating competition with Pinkie
Snuffsis: I'mma think it.
:D
that'd be a tough call
Of course he is. He's green, and his species reproduces with eggs.
HE's not asexual
hold on
Therefore, Yoshis = Namekians and Namekians = Yoshis
He kinda is
Yoshi lays eggs
WAHOO
The only reason he would be able to lay eggs is if he could use them to reproduce
has Superbrony64 already cleared SMG2?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Bouuw5jWk
Relevant
Barrel_of_Fun: yah
Yoshi has been shown to be a guy or at least very manly, so....kinda a-sexual.
Or maybe, in their species the male lay the eggs, while the women fertilise them.
Like seahorses
Since there are female yoshis
that makes NO sense
BAWS galaxy
Either they're asexual or every one in any of the Mario games where they throw eggs is female.
10,02I didn't get all the green stars yet Barrel_of_Fun :/
another Prankster

it's evil
Female seahorse lay egss.
A plant hatching from an egg? Whaaaat?
IT'S EVIL
Male seahorse just carry them.
Thunderpony: what's evil?

A black toad

It's funny how nintendo can use the same basis over and over again for their games and make them amazing.
I feel so bored watching him die over and over again...
Call of duty on the other hand..
00,10oh I see
Shigeru Miyamoto is a GENIUS, lol

He's killing himself
Indeed he is.
I think he finds it fun?
there is a star at the end of that ramp thing
00,10he's shooting for 100%
mfw steam wont accept my prepaied master card thing but paypal will
Wait what really?
The green star is in the air
so he keeps missing it
SB u expert stay right!:D
He's a hardcore completetionist isn't he?
that is why he kills himself

I pointed that out, like, 3 lives before he got game over :P

00,10no we figured it out 10 or so deaths ago.
I knew what you were doing SuperBrony64 :3 I got 100% on this game.
that one is a bitch to get.
on the plus side my account is now a 'premium account', whatever that meens
it was worth the wait
What do you mean, "You"? I figured it out a loooong time ago :P
00,10Phase4 trade it to wrek for somthing =p
Sumica: mabey later, not sure what i actualy want
into the ear!
Yay, extra lives
BUY ALL THE LIVES
All them lives
Just what you need right about now, eh? :P
gah, they literally throw 1-UPS at you GEEZ
Remember in the old days, when you had to WORK for your 1-ups?
:(
00,10well you do still have to catch them.
ikr?
Easiest is probably super mario 64
unlock cannon outside castle, find yoshi and get maximum lives
It's mama luigi!
Stuck in luigis nose
00,10always knew marios head was full of crap
xD
Pfft, that cannon requires you to beat the game 100% anyway
GULP
if anyone knows the importance of taking a break, it'd be Nintendo. :D
GrimGallop: Still makes it easy to max 1-ups! :P
Yoshi's Island for the SNES, I lioved that game
Only after it doesn't matter any more XD

Years of practice

SB's name fits him very well

He has a masters degree in gaming... xD
You guys should see the Tool-Assisted speedrun of this game...0 stars, 5 minutes and 2 seconds to beat all 3 bowser fights.
seen it
dem bombs!
Can't really say its a real speedrun though
Why not?
dat wind!!
10,02Better :3
I can't dash through like this, lol, I gotta take it slow
the game isn't beaten the way it's spposed to
woah, you should see the glitches i'm gettin on this game
So long gay bowser
wats SuperBrony64s real name???????
found all the stars on this game, lol
Mario
Britanny
lol
Larry
/me bursts into flames
Hello midnight
no its not htf does he dothat
/me tosses a wool blanket over Midnight_Tempest
I'd argue against that...while they don't collect the stars like the game wants them to, they are completing the main goal of defeating Bowser.
10,02O___o
lol this part was a pain in tha ass
lol
Sumica <3 *rolls around in the blanket*
So you think it's a valid speedrun when they cheat their way through the game? :P
not really
I call HAX
I call it "creative use of game mechanics"
well, im off to bed now... night all!
gnight Midnight_Tempest
night Midnight_Tempest!
it's not game mechanics, it's bug exploitation.
:P
Bye Midnight_Tempest
They aren't entering any cheat codes. They're just abusing glitches. SB64 did it here to get to the final Bowswer fight...normally you have to have 70 stars to get there.
Yea i know.
speeding through the level is fine, but glitching to other worlds and all that, lol I mean come oooon
Speedruns should, to me, be done by completing the game properly without abusing glitches.
yes
It's ment as entertainment and to see just how quickly a game can be beaten. It's not taken as a legitimate speedrun.
it is pretty entertaining, lol
Thats why, OtakuTom, i said "Can't really say it's a real speedrun though". :P
So long gay bowser
well done SB
Some people call them tool-assisted superplays...I'm just used to calling them speedruns, 'cause a lot of videos still use that term.
And i call it cheating.
i UR GETTING DEFETED BY A TINY MINI GUY BOWSER U GAY FUCKIN FREAK!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL U R A GAY DEAD FREAK NOW!!!!

its a piece of cake to make a pretty cake
It's a game for kids !
Where Thunderpony wheres it goin??
UNTIL ALL THE SEXUAL HAPPENED
10,02You only need about 16 stars to beat this game.
sex
Oh
kk
10,02IF
10,02You exploit glitches
Weird
10,0271 otherwise.
Yea.
71 for being legit
I would exploit glitches
SuperBrony64, 0 stars are needed if exploiting glitches.
10,02lol, without using a Game Shark I mean :3
cant you glitch through the stairs?
10,02Yes
ah gameshark
I would do both
lol
or is that with 17 stars
These glitches would've been patched day 1 if it was released today. :P
Same here, without any actual cheats, just game glitches.
10,02THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PLAYING MY GAME
Snuffsis: there would have been more glitches day 1
u shud play Super mario World sometime
schhh
Oooh...SMW is such a great game
Phase4: don't forget day 1 dlc
ikr?
lololololololololololololololololoolololololololololololololololololololololololololololoolooololooolololoololololooolololololololololololiolololololololololololol Cause im bored!
Snuffsis: plus hats, would allso be able to buy different hats for mario
10,02No spamming applejack096 O__O
Let's see...I was...oh...7...when the SNES came out? something like that?
yes, hats.
this was the glory days
No...I was 5 XD
Haha, my mother still plays her SNES
Same here...
She's badass
10,02Wow, what a cool mom O___O
My mother loved Super Mario RPG
I play Mega Man X about once a month all the way through.
LOL bice Snuffsis
I'm going to grab some caffeine
Now I know you're not talking about my mother.
it not spamming its saying lol over and over!
*nice
She hates 3D games, she's all about NES and SNES
...when was the snes released?
She knows EVERY extra-life and secret in Legend of Zelda. the second game
Then I'm going to fire up ZSNES and simultaneously play this :D
Phase4: 92 IIRC?
dang, it's dark and I can't see my keyboard very well so excuse my spelling errors, lol
Heck, I still play my NES from time to time.
ohai xles , how bout the nes? when was that
86 maybe?
NES 88
i think it was
SNES was 199...1, IIRC...the copyright date on SMW was 1990 - 1991
Makin Bacon? mmmmm I liek bacon
83 for the NES in the US
10,02SNES was 1990
91 us and 92 europe for snes
so if the nes came out while you were 16, you would be 40 now
which is old enough to have kids playing videogames
Ah... It was 92 over here in communist europe.
10,02Well, 1991 for USA
I was 3 when my family got the NES...6 when we got the SNES.
that sounds wrong, i think my derp math
anybody ever make it to the SPECIAL world in this game?
-1?
never actualy played this game, read about -1 though
I love the SPECIAL world
dat incomplete list
10,02lol
I see a gamer nerd
Wow...someone with more consoles and handhelds than me...
10,02Where? O___O
OMG you got the virtual boy?
Hugs superbrony64* right here
:D
I've never met anyone that had more than me.
According to wikipedia, I'm absolutely correct about 92 for snes and 86 for nes! ...But only if you live in europe, which I do. *rolleyes*
10,02I love the virtual boy :3
Lets go and grabs a shovel
Gives you a headache though. :/

/me has been smart enough to stay away from hot sugar
00,10what's worse, what do you do when you get somthing hot on your skin?
get it off? water it? depends on the gunk i supose
00,10first thing you would do is bring you hand to the point of pain to brush away what it is.
00,10smearing the molten suger.
10,02I'M DRINKING
BER
B EE R
BEER
10,02Sparkling water with Pomegranate flavoring :3
DERP
00,10admiting it is the first step
rub on that tube
First time I just brushed it off and went to cool it with water
00,10must not have been too hot then.
YES FINALLY I GOT CONNECTION

Damn you, SB
10,02For my Psychology of Prejudice and Stereotyping class
sure sb
10,02	I stand before you friends and fellow classmates, not as a student, not as a man, not as a white person, but instead as a human being. Being human is what links us all together. We are all of the same species. It is the foundation for which defines our very existence. Build upon that, we have our culture, the result of generations and generations of specific groups of humans working
10,2together for a common cause. On top of that, we have our own mentality, it defines our interests, how we act, and so on. Individual behaviors and qualities make us unique. For the good, we use it to make us stand out from others. For the bad, we use it to judge.
10,02	Judgement is no stranger to our way of life, it allows us to assess a situation and determine what’s the best cause in the end. However, others use this as a chance to belittle those around him or her. People make fun of other cultures and people make fun of other races.

Dadadadadadadadadada BATMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pow Zok handshake
00,10Only issue I see is the perspective on the head. it's a profile yet I see both nostrles.
The Penguin goes Straight
Woah, thanks, Sumica. Totally forgot about that :o
did i miss a picture?
Mine, lol :D
oh hi btw
RaveBrony, shouldn't a pony stand on 4 legs, just saying
KwakLad: http://derpy.me/ORp-J
00,10lolwut
Get the comfy chsir!
*chair
Yeah, but I wanted to try something that Wrek does where the pony stands on 2 legs instead :P
RaveBrony thats cool
Hol Black out drops!
Holy
00,10i can see the Wrek influnce =p
I have one where he is standing on 4 legs, but it makes the shield look stupid to have on :D
btw, this is what i'm using to shorten links: http://derpy.me/3otCm
/me == ariscop
True...he wouldn't hold it.
yeah i agree with sumica but i dont think its a full profile, because by the way the legs are and seeing that the body is turned slightly towards the viewer, the head would also be turned a bit
/me must vanish, as his computer is starting to run very slowly for some reason
00,10true KwakLad
O.o
also is that guy brittish in badman? so hes evil
I blame Trixie grim
awww i only can watch one more pony episode before i have to go
00,10might need to ajust the eye a bit then.
Well I'm going too
/me leaves
how do i change the channel im watchin batman o3o
Derpy1: hai
hey o3o
Derpy1, there is only on channel here
s/\w+/do you work in here Terminus-Bot?/g
nope
one
gasp
Adjust the eye how? :P like more down or angled to the side?
:P
it'd be nice if the regex feature worked in here
dat 555
6_9 o3o
wow, so few people in the regulars room
Hai Derpy1!
so on saturday when the new mlp episode comes on it will appear on this live stream o3o
00,10hard to say, just so it matches the perspective more.
00,10yes Derpy1
Plus i wanted to make him a unicorn (so he can Use the sword), would I horn look out of place or no?
hhmmmm but why is it on tv land not hub network
pick up the batphone in the batcar to tell batbutler to meet us at the batcave
bat bat bat
On ED, they said the new episode does not come out this Saturday
on march 3rd it does
!cd
Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 2 days, 5 hours, 53 minutes, 39 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
yup saturday
so does this thing change to hub network when its available
RaveBrony i think removing the left nostrle might make the eye look correctly positioned (left according to viewers position)
00,10it's not realy on tv land it's just there are no non watermarked versions of this show.
so its just a stall until hub network is available o3o
I think that ED is wrong, the new episode will most likely be on Sat
Alfred is badass!
00,10stall?
^
well idk how to say it
no wait, it is acutally on Sat
00,10i guess first off I should say we dont stream pony all the time.
Yhere is another ep with Fluttershy
Derpy1 Let me ask, do you assume we normally stream the HUB perminantly?
i assumed yes o3o
ahh
no
That airs on March 24
Derpy1, no this is just a fun stream that does silly stuff :)
o3o not the 3rd for the new mlp episode ?
Oh RaveBrony, your so silly. :)
:$
Derpy1 only on new pony eps (or some other events im not sure of) the rest of the time its whatever streamers want or are requested to stream (if they feel nice)
00,10oh hey, they are using the equestria girls promo again.
Yeah new episoe is on Sat
Really, Sumica? o.o
Derpy1 the next new pony ep is this saturday (the 3rd)
Haha that promo was funny
^
00,10yeah all this talk of hub prompted me to turn the tv on.
so it will show on this stream?
i dont know this equestria girls promo
ponies are new eps on saturday, and 2 eps with movie night
Hold up KwakLad I'll find it for you
!cd
Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 2 days, 5 hours, 47 minutes, 57 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
Derpy1 yes the new pony ep is going to be streamed (i think unless there is some problem)
ew
I just got in and seeing the penguin eating something
thanks Derpy123
Penguin is tossing a party?
KwakLad thx o3o
Well, I'm actualy MASF123 this is just for Derpy Day

so please,oh please RSVP and come and be our guest
ahh
why are you moving to Japan?
ohh yeah i remember youexplaining your plan now
That is the scary part, the chances of me actually staying behind, doing the JPL and living in japan. :P
BronyinJapan: I'm taking a 1 year trip to Japan to study the Japanese language, culture and all that.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lowij-5Q5Xg
Cool been here for about 2 years
I just know 3 Japanese words... konichiwa, sayonara and (domo) arigato (probably spelled wrong too)
CountDoofus: Shouldn't be that hard really. grab some toiletpaper rolls. seal up the bottom and stick them onto something like her harness
i wanna go to germany, canada, sweden or finnland when i get the chance as i have family there also just wanna get out of the UK
and then load with a bit of gunpowder and random confetti
and a small igniter.
Arigatou i tihnk would be the romaji spelling of the world, :P
But BronyinJapan could probably confirm it. :P
ありがとう
hell, for my job, I know how to compose a bomb. so making a confetti blaster shouldn't be to hard :p
secret butt fun!
KwakLad, why go to sweden? It's almost exactly like the uk, boring, dull and grey.
Who wants me to say a sentecn in Japanese
CountDoofus: You an explosives expert?
secret butt fun or scary butt fun?
IT BEGINS
no, airport security guard
but Snuffsis if you are using toilet paper tubes then they might burn if you use gunpowder
:o
BronyinJapan: Go ahead. :P
http://luna-cf.komica2.net/12/src/1330531458719.jpg
w..t..f
Twi_Fi Arigatoo
and im a chemistry/physics student its compulsary to know how to make bombs too
HO GOD I dun bin trolled
Oh wow, I only have 103 tabs open in Firefox.
what?
I thought I had like 130 or something.
KwakLad: Well, it was just an example, you could just use a coppertube or something as well. :P
lol Kammerjunk is that why you been relatively quiet? because you couldnt find us?
KwakLad: Oh, no. I've been in school.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjXr0-luNA&feature=endscreen&NR=1
CountDoofus: So, as an airport security guard, you need the know-how for how to make bombs? xD
LOOK AT THE URL
ITS A PONY VID AND IT HAS LUNA
But yeah, it's not easy to navigate.
:o
say WHAAAAAAAAAAT
Snuffsis i wanna be out of the UK but in a country atleast relatively good for engineering
ofna01: It's a message from Luna.
KwakLad: aah, cool, how about MIT then?
:D
どういたしまして
She wants us to prepare for the pony invasion.
/me pumps shotgun
Snuffsis: not really the know-how on how to make one, just know what components it needs in order to be a functioning IED
dat other language text
Kayoobi Boku Wa Oto-San To Snowboard-Ga Desu
KwakLad: Yes, MIT as in Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The world renown university for when it comes to engineering.

BronyinJapan: Something about your father going snowboarding? :P
I think i said it wrong but I only stared learning this year
Snuffsis Yes on Saturday

Im Back!
My basic knowledge of Japanese hasn't failed me! :D

Hii

Learned what from anime? O.o
The Japanese i know is all learned from watching anime, for about 15 years
O_o
sorry if this is a dumb question, but what's the difference between manga and anime?
Pretty much the same with nglish.
Manga is the books
anime is ANIMated

applejack096: But in all reality, your previous message came in a brief periode of a lot of people talking.
So I didn't see it.
D:
BronyinJapan: Better spelled as Ichi, Ni, San, Yon (shi sometimes), Go, Roku, Nana, Hachi, Kjyuu, Jyuu.
CountDoofus: yay, banzai! it's a Manga author /drawer. :P
Wat?? I dont understand Kammerjunk!!!! :S
Snuffsis thanks my Japanese teacher showed us once and spelled them differernt
And then comes Jyuuichi, Jyuuni, Jyuusan and so on. When it comes to Twenty it's Nijyuu, Nijyuuichi
Aah, okay.
applejack096: When you said "Im Back!", a lot of people were talking, so it got kind of flooded out.
So, guys. Why is Russian so awesome?

CountDoofus: pretend you have a little sister or a niece that wants one?
Or just man up and not give a damn? :P

take valium first?
the thought has crossed my mind. but, those McD ponies all have failmarks :(
Viagra is better
Twi_Fi try this 希少
CountDoofus: fail marks?

If they came to Denmark, I would so walk up there in a pony shirt.

It is the most sophisticated piece of work literally ever, you know.
MLP First aired on 10/10/10 (101010) which is binary for 42
Well, asides from Earth.

I'm at work, feel like drawing. come home, don't feel like drawing. conclusion: work kills ambition
KAmmer
ofna
i've read every book in my house
CountDoofus: You only realised that now?
EVEN THE DICTIONARY
I cant read Japanese that good
Well, go to EQD!
what CountDoofus said, conclusion, dont work
There's like a million fanfics there.
It's the same with school
School kills creativity and diverse thinking
instead of promoting it
Well, yes.
yes
Besides that, many schools still work with outdated methods.
everyschool does
Kammerjunk i agree
hai everypony :)
Depends on the level of education, actually.
Oh hi, Iwubponiez.
ohai Iwubponiez
half the kids at my school were retards
It's all based on an industrial method where everyone is lined up in grades depending on their creation date
instead of what they're able to do.
wat
This HTX school I toured was pretty heavy on newish technology.
YES YES me and my dad think so to
happy derpy day 6_9
happy derpy day!
I have no celebrated Derpy day.
everyone use this emote in 3 seconds
There are some methods which try to break away from that kind of method, but that just makes it worse.
I have no muffins.

^
ILL TURN MY FRYING PAN,INTO A DRYING PAN!

I forgot to buy one, so I ate a cinnamon bun instead.
He's flim, he's flam and we're something
Cinnamon buns are so awesome.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawUi9s3ENE
i just had a chocolate muffin, imma save my blueberry one for an evening stream if there is one
Drying pan!
i need a muffin
:(
lol drying pan
Snuffsis: Shame it's 1920x1080.
GAAAH
Both my screens are 1920x1200.
NO
You use a bigger one?
Snuffsis Niceeee
Which is really darn annoying.
Kammerjunk: Stop being so 16:10 and be more 16:9
So many pony wallpapers are made in 1920x1080.
But the bigger screens, man!
WHY COUNT WHY
CountDoofus: why did she not go to her own home? or was it repo'd?
idk, ask the artist :p
You should know that 16:9 is the PROPER widescreen format. Hmph!
You should know that bigger is better.
i will take her with me :(
*sigh* I want a computer drawing program....
Gimp is open source
try that
RaveBrony: Go torrent PhotoShop or Illustrator.
:o
Actually, just get the master suite.
http://www.gimp.org/
well im nearly done installing that stupid driver update
NEED A DISPENSER HERE!
try and find it some otherway
Pootis spencer here
Need a teleporter here!
I thot Wrek used some Adobe thing O.o
he used to
CS5 is best CS.
Nah, he uses sai
maybe sometimes
but atm he used SAI
RaveBrony: Wrek used to use Illustrator.
But yeah, he uses SAI now.
o.o
Wrek used to use Adobe Illustrator... but then he took a SAI to the hard drive.
But he also has a tablet worth atleast 300 bucks :P
I think it's for different methods of drawing.
I need $70 tho :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vMPgnUC_9A
Hey, guess what's stuck in my head.
POOTISPECER HERE
Ravebrony, like i said. Try gimp : http://www.gimp.org/
It's free and decent
After a year working in Photoshop exclusively, going back to SAI and playing with it, I miss is so much.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM is what's stuck in my head.
NOO
Hey who wants to see a picture of what I look like?
:o
YES.
Ill try those
The pressure level for lines and brushes is so much more developed than in PS.
That'd be cool
Lineart is delicious to do in SAI
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo0cAk35pDg
wonder if there'll ever be any G4 sea ponies tho
my TF2 micpsam
micspam*
I really miss the days of TF2 class updates.
Everyone would just go one class.
Ravebrony: you could also try http://www.portalgraphics.net/en/oc/
Like when the scout got his update
It's a good software as well.
Yeah.
The many thing is even if I torrent a program, I still need one of those drawing things, lol
i dont have very many Scout items
I don't always play Scout.
But when I do, I use the FaN.
i have Soda Popper,Bonk,Winger,Sun-on-a-Stick
tried using Inkscape once... bloody thing crashed while coloring an area
RaveBrony: For a beginner, i'd recommend a Wacome Bamboo tablet for drawing
Wacom Bamboo*
Yeah :P
Just, please.
bamBOO
Get one with a screen.
They are quite cheap. :P
anyone wanna play TF2?
I bought a Wacom Bamboo tablet WITHOUT a screen, and it's difficult to learn using.
KAmmerjunk: He probably doesn't have THAT much money to spend. :P
ofna01: I just booted it up, actually.
ill start up my dell
I sure wanna
I don't even know what they cost.
its on there
Meh, Ill just have to deal atm. I just think Id like my drawings better if they were on the computer :\
if i get a new one i would want one with a screen
Hey who wants to see a picture of what I look like when I arrvied in Japan?
I remember when the backburner was really OP
Well Wacom Cintiq 24HD Cost about 2400 dollars.
wat
We may never know what the Pyro said.
There cheapest one is Wacom Cintiq 12wx and cost about 900 dollars.
BronyinJapan: Bring it.

That was before I found Ponies
BronyinJapan, is that you in Japan?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3154/ MFW VALVe keeps giving me crates instead of stuff I need.
i need a key
RaveBrony Yes
mine has alot of good stuff in it
You should have stood 2 feet back, then it would have been a GREAT photo.
:D
Lucky...wish i was in Japan
as do i
it would be beneficial to my calm
I wish I was in the UK.
hah
Kammerjunk, its really not great
Noone WANTS to live in the UK
they only live there because they have to
true story
It got to be better than Denmark.
Doubt it
it really cant
unfoundbug Kammerjunk its not that bad in the UK its just not worth staying in
Denmark is awesome though
Weeds, drinking at 16
only visit no more
booting TF2 up
etc
theres an understatement
TOO MUCH SPAM
^
Hey Kammerjunk, mountains
I don't drink except for at parties. Weed is illegal, but I don't do it anyway.
u mad?
Kammerjunk
Hello?
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PLAY TF2?
Kammerjunk It's not Illegal, but it's not legal either
It's just decriminalized
decriminalized?
Well im back to school for the second time today
is that even a word?
Meh, im not in the mood for TF2
Jim: What'd I use mountains for?
talk to you later my little ponies
:(
Meaning you can't get arrested for using it
bye KwakLad
Well, you wouldn't know
I don't even smoke cigarettes.
Bye KwakLad!
climb them of course
cya Kwak
cya kwak
Jim: I don't climb anything. I don't even go to fitness.
I just have this machine at home.
Kammerjunk: Neither do i, but i still enjoy the occasional joint (haven't taken any in forever now though)
It's just so relaxing when sitting in the sofa.
im online Kammer
wanna play?
oh well, everybody's got different interests I guess
I would not smoke anything if my life didn't depend on it.
Wat you playing?
sitting "in" the sofa?
I love rock climbing
TF2
ofna01: Sure. I'm just "Kammerjunk" on Steam.
yes unfoundbug, sitting IN the sofa.
im ofna01
XD
It's a special kind of position
Like the Kamasutra, but for relaxation. :P
Oh, great. I got another weapon on TF2 I don't use, but I'll keep anyway.
Give me stuff then, if you don't need it! :D
I'll fire up TF2 with you
Snuffsis: But I don't have it already!
what server are you guys going on
kammer
add me on steam
A pony server, probably. If there's enough room.

i thought I just did ._.

The Appledash one?

*launches TF2

I was about to go to a Legion of Ponies server, but it's almost full.
I already got you friended snuffsis

There, I went on a server.
Oh hi, Sumica.

Never mind, I went on a wrong server.
Yeah, I know.
I'm an idiot.
:|

It's basically where I mess around with my loadout.
its only got 6 ppl on it,join
On my way.
so... I got some weapons I don't want. Battalion Backup, Huntsman, Sydney Sleeper, Solemn Vow, Crusader's Crossbow, Bushwacka, Cloak and Dagger, and Buffalo Steak Sandvich. any takers?
ME
CLOAK

I just want to find some weapons so I can get my bloody hat already.

Hello?
It's supposed to be an achievement server for engineers.
But no one uses it as such.

Nice vid :)
*kicks computer cause its taking too long to load 20 seconds* :| Nothings going right this morning
Im going to get something to eat. Whataburger is open and serve burgers 24/7 :)
suddenly TF2 crash. cba to restart
Before I go, am I the only one a bit agravated McDonalds makes you wait till after 11 am for a burger?
don't think burgers as breakfast is quite healthy
but hey, we're all gonna die anyway, so screw McD
Anything from McDonalds for breakfast is unhealthy.
But it tastes good.
even the salad
Why shoulnt it be, Denny's serves Steak & Eggs for breakfast. Burger has bread, cheese for dairy, meat for protein, tomatoes and pickles for vegetables
if you wanna call it meat :D
so who wants to see me with a monkey on my shoulder?
/me raises his hand
Whataburger has better beef patties anyway
http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v31/Connor/?action=view&current=ikmetaap.jpg
Is that you on that guy's shoulder?
o u
:$
haj again
Now this is a burger! http://www.bestburgerrecipes.com/image-files/tall-hamburger.jpg
Warning: may cause instant heart attack.
The calories are over 9,000!
Dang it.
Shaggy & Scooby had no problem with size :P
Did I really just take 40 minutes to do an update and fix someone's Excel from crashing?
Cypresswolf, that's death on a bun.
literally.
:) Deep Fry for instant death
Actually, only if you can finish in one sitting
Allis, you may want to avoid Texas State Fairs...
Yea applejack woohooo
I was in the States for 3 weeks in 2004... Don't think a day went by without eating at least 1 burger
I eat too many burgers for my own good.
I've been living here since 03
and coming back to the States, in a few months, can't wait!
The novelty wears off eventually, trust me
Rodeo is guilty of it too, I've seen fried cotton candy
What we talking about?
burgers, fried food, and all manner of unhealthy tasty food
I suddenly have a craving for frozen bananas
Fried cotton candy? Would Discord approve?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSvaX6t7rUM&list=SL&feature=sh_e_se
Mm, mm, interesting
/me nods in agreement while eating a slice of pizza
Discord: YES! YES!
http://www.motifake.com/image/demotivational-poster/0901/ultimate-death-burger-dinner-food-demotivational-poster-1233352462.jpg
Is that from that heartattack burger joint thing?
the one where they sell the Triple Bypass Burger? perhaps
oh the irony
ye
I saw that article a few days ago...I consider the name to be a warning
*warning enough
brb
ehhh
so bored...
That's not irony, if he was eating a "heart curer" burger and suffered a heart attack, then I think it would be ironic
Honestly I like a burger as much as the next guy
And yesterday I made a mistake of eating more than I should
Lol!! Yeah
But seriously, eating that much fat is just dumb
^
I get my share of fast/junkfood on a weekly basis... maybe I should get my cholesterol level checked
I checked mine last year, my bad cholesterol was good, the good cholestrol was low
some stalls, mainly in the carnival area of the Houston Rodes, makes fried frog legs. These aint the ones you find in Lousiana, no no! These are over cooked, and tough as nails to eat. making them terrible
I'm just fat due to sedentarism really
I want to make some epic cupcakes or something :D
I workout for an hour or more everyday, I fear being fat sooo much >.<
In my view, if you can stomach a couple of those, you can handle anything
I'd love some fat... my digestive system always works in overdrive, so I can eat pretty much all I want and gain zilch weight
I have been told I would fill out since starting to ride a motorbike, the opposite has happened
^ I hate you
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM9aRvnAlsM best scene ever! :D
I'm pretty much the opposite. Everything I eat goes straight to some fat deposit
Oh pinkie pie, you so cute. <3
http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132979854883.jpg
oh well. gonna do some L4D and get me a kebab after
Doofus
aye?
wanna multiplay? :D
as long as it isn't Versus :)
Yea, coop. campaign or something ? :D
I'm pretty good at campaigns, but terrible in vs
not a big fan of survival
I just found the creepiest Apple family pic O_o Granny Smith, Big Mac, AB, & AJ at a table full of meat and they're tearing it apart
Google image search Baked Bads...

in the case of three's a crowd, its vinyl scratch and octavia, but its very well done and not smut at all really
oh ok thx bye everypony

nope
83 is if you argue with a troll you will become a troll
can't rape the willing
oh god
since when
i thought i was the only one who used that line?
urban dictionary says rule 83 is "Arguing with any troll for any length of time will in turn make you a troll"
why, unfoundbug, WHY???
because it was the first spongbob pony link i found
burn
05,15yeah...but that's not a ponified spngebob

trill?
nvm
akuma's trill
I can't find one
wait a minute!

and I can't find the OFFICIAL rule for if it exists, there is a pony version of it.
a trill is when you alternate quickly between two music notes.

:)
:D
Saske909090: we do not mention that fanfic here
uuupps
:[
sorry
hmm
OH! AcousticBrony got Pinkie Pie song out...
or any of the other obscene fanfics
10,02ScootaChicken O___O
I wonder what bronystate is like during the summer...
/me glares at SuperBrony64
Not fanfics....
/me glomps SuperBrony64
ok
so
ugh
/me is glared at and glomped O___O
your reaction to derpy :D
10,02hai ScootaChicken :3
SuperBrony64 is a silly filly :3
10,02i liek silly filly :3
My reaction to derpy? No reaction. I had no idea what "derpy" was at that moment.
10,02today is silly filly day :3
...
10,02cause derpy is a silly filly :>
Pegasister here~! (\
/me /)(\ pony_9374
10,02Dat Rain
So, are fillies girl ponies or child ponies? Im still bit confused bout tht
SuperBrony64 Finally you have clothes on.
10,02IKR
fillies are young female ponies
In fact the order was derpy -> derpy chat -> bronystate -> ballad of a brony -> EQD ... the rest fit after that
Ah
w00t~
What are young male ponies?
10,02silly fillies is gender neutral in my opinion though :3
My herd handed out muffins on the street downtown and near the university /)^3^(\
colts
whats your opinion on Discord?
10,02Awesome CrazyBronyDonut :D
10,02I want a muffin :3
Oh my gosh, who else is addicted to At the Gala and Winter Wrap Up remixes? = u=
Hm.....seems legit
indeed SuperBrony64
Superbrony64 you are the silliest filly
he is a silly filly
yep we had letters we wrote too:)
10,02i liek silly :>
Not enough history about Discord. I would like to know more about Discords relationship with Luna & Celestia.
adult females are called mares and adult males are called stallions
happy Derpy hooves day
i knew tht
But Discord with Q voice = awesome sauce
more relationship with them?
happy Derpy dat RainbowJack
day*
more relationship with ERIS
:P
Id be in between colt and stallion ^^
Eris=Female version of discord
Derpy Hooves day? o.o
eeeeeeyup
yep
Nice XD
I still think it would be awesome if they did a kind of future version of MLP. I would love seeing where each pony stands in the future.
Billy and Mandt <3
next question issss
mandy*
Stempunk pony XD
i would like to see the CMC grown up
*steampunk
do you like pyro?
/me is a mare
wow
That sudden nostalgia wave Meeplord
okay this question doesnt count
Yeah lol
hmmm
flutter_spin: the problem with that is as people grow up, they sometimes grow apart a bit, ponies like rarity, if her business caught on, would probably become a little distant with the rest of the mane 6
and that kind bums the whole friendship is magic thing
YOUR ALL OPINION ON STALKERLOO
MY OPINION IS YOU SHOULD USE LESS CAPS
sorry :P
/me throws a shoe at Saske909090 "no all caps!"
more pony music please, im not sure what to listen to
plz forget derpy :P
/me throws a shoe at Ingwaz too
/me dodges
I remember a show doing a Future Version reference, but it was crazy how they set it up.
i might be able to convert my 84 year old granffather into a brony
SHOE FIGHT!
the day we get a scootaloo-rainbow dash ep is the day my heart explodes and i grab the insulin
The past goes into the future and sees everyone broken up in different areas
no shoe fights
...
next question cause you dont care
/me throws a shoe at Meeplord "no all caps"
hmmm
And the past version does everything she can to get the future ones together again
/me throws a shoe
flutter_spin: that was Teen Titans
thats it!
/me shows a chubbie
do you liek chubbies?
I like cookies..
I wanted to know if someone knew the reference
I'm now sufficiently drunk. Should I drive?
Yes!
lol no
1 yes, 1 no
Anyways, that episode of Teen Titans was AWESOME
/me is a good role model
Tovler: fly a plane
/me flys away
Running low on mtn. dew......crap
Tovler: please dont drive, fly a plane okay then
Tolver fly a tank
It's funny because it used to be "legal"
/me gets mail from derpy
oh cool
/me /me /me
a question from derpy :D
okay
,,Dyou like muffinz"
hello everypony
thats all
no.

ohai derpy_pony
Zoidburg is best pony

/me is still waiting for someone to ponify/derpify the Humpty Dance

MAD has made a couple
Hello everypony!
A pokemon that looks like a pony
BARREL
wonder if there is a OOT/Mjarora's romhack to make epona into one of the mane 6
http://images.serebii.net/poster.jpg
tl;dr
not sure if want
/me is sad not knowing the new pokemon
I spent the whole afternoon hunting for blind bags. 12 toy shops. My loot so far: 1 glowing rarity and 1 glowing pinkie pie. If someone told me half a year ago I would ever do something like that...
lol, @ the snowflake pokemons
/me is dissapointed in modern cartoons
I managed to recognise 6 of those pokemon
Hallo meine freunden.
hallo britischer broniker
dry era in animation is dry Meeplord
:3
no wait, 8
indeedly
I have no idea which pokemon is which...never played this game
I'm not that determined in the blind bags. I went to Toys R Us, got 4 of the 6 mane, and then left.
BritishBrony|British: Hallo meine Freunde, that’s how you say it
next question
modern cartoons suck, because all kids now like is that !lolranDUMB! stuff....
Frunden is the plural.
let me think
I went to 3 Toys R Us shops and found nothing...gave up on this chain after that
do you watch MLP FIM in secret?
Freunde is the plural
Not anymore
http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/
yes.
10,02Off to class, later everypone ^_^
10,02everypony*
Suddenly nostalgia
is there a quiz going on?
Studied 3 years of the fecking language and I'veforgotten about 80% of it. :3
im open and i recruit people
gj and learn a lot Superbrony64
bye SB
BritishBrony|British: I know better than you, for I am German ;)
since my mum found my fluttershy tshirt
Bye SB!
bye SB
I watch it in secret because I really don't want my Mom watching ANYTHING I do... not when she blabs how "someone didn't have a warrant to enter the house" kind of stuff
have fun SB
Ah.
but
i watch it in secret
Toys R Us was crazy...this gigantic shelf gorge, in which absolutely everything is pink...where no man has gone before...
cause my brother is a hater
he hates MLP FIM
the only person that knows i watch that show is my flatmate
i have converted 25 people so far ^^
he is relentless about mocking me for it
ive converted 0
/me hates haters
only 2 peeps know im a brony
mlp isn't something you need to convert others to...
converted 1
kay next
getting him to watch an episode just gave him more ammunition
I dont mind being made fun of for watching, as long as its in a way that i can join in
did you played game ,,GO FAST"
I pretty much told everybody once. Nobody wanted to hear those words again from me, but they dont "hate" MLP
im pretty well known at my college though so that may be why
why is there a ad?
They would have felt the same way if I told people I love pokemon.
/me shrugs
...
evil tricking add
ad*
*cough* spikehascrushonrarity *cough*
Adblock :P
have it
FOORRREEEEVVVEERRRR
hey guys
using it
Saske909090: GODDAMNIT spoilertags next time
wassup
no idea why it's not working
ever played game called GO FAST
yep
'fraid now
on EQD? yes
not*
oh wait
fluff :)
Ever play pong?

:)
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/591002
Plasma Pong :P
Saske909090: go break your spacebar. :U
i did won this game ^^
and my spacebar didnt break
http://9gag.com/gag/3057025
:D
this is
i nearly did but then my arm tired out
me
i like how mike made a cameo at the begining of the flash :)
fluffy is soooo cute :3
YES Sasje909090
/me hugs chubbie derpy
Sadly Paradise, my friends don't have time for me anymore
its a shame 'cause my fluffy drowned
They all got married, full time jobs, and got kids.
next question
your reaction on derpy talking?
you asked that already
nop
i asked
you reaction to derpy
flufflepuff's bad end scenes are so heart tearing ;_;
:D
Anyway, I better do my Homework othernow or it will be like this: *Get up at 2am, do homework rubishly, not go back to sleep, wait until 3am to go on this chatroom merely to say 'oh boy, 3am' and fall asleep in history- thus getting after school detentions for the rest of my life.
fairly standard reaction, mostly omg, and speechless
Didn't know it was derpy until she spoke
what AJ means in MLP FIM?
so quiet
...
I guess it's a typical response to anyone who didn't know who Derpy is before that episode
aj = applejack
/me is definitely not here.
just as RD = rainbow dash
yea
/me hugs Shizuka
what would you do if pinkamena would kidnap you?
quiet again...
no idea reallly
/me does not approve
a) yay id be in equestria
try not to remember *that*
Saske909090: this sounds like its heading towards the unmentionable fic again, we do not mention it at all
b) pinkamena is scary as
i kno
THIS DO NOT MENTION FANFIC
FOR PETE SAKE
=.= -caps please
easy on the canterlot voice
indeed, do you have billy mays syndrome?
next...
if you would have wings what would you do?
fly
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2bcWav9Mn0&t=10m18s RD calls Applejack AJ
Fly.
aaand
fly to the moon and rescue luna
yup
nextttt...
do you want to live in ponyville?
Sure.
guys?
Fo sho
That's me!
nope~
why not
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYBlLnfjaXw&t=8m50s AJ calls Rainbow Dash RD
too orderly~
next shall be
I rather live in everfree forest~
i dont think i would leave if i ended up there, but i wouldnt actively try to get there
do you like mmmmmmmmmmm bananas?
/me runs
celestia asked :P
no opinion
i love asking :#
Maybe, i dunno
kay next
/me runs away*
muffinz or cupcakes?
no opinion
Muffinz is best always
considering my rather large stockpile, muffins :d
muffinz won
buy one get one free and the shop on the way back, so i bought 16
next shall be
Success ! I just retrieved a perfect Coke from the fridge! Chilled to just the right degree where little ice particle are floating in it . HEAVEN!
do you have guts to meet molestia?
ah man there is a cofee place that does these apple and cinnamon muffins
yes
I do not accept Molestia as real
/me runz
is like the best thing ever
MOLESTIA
GTF
flutter_spin, its a what-if style question, if she was real, would you be able to meet her
/me is angry
eghgh
next
No, I mean that my brain only accepts Celestia. No way can I picture her as Molestia
understandable
If molestia was real, she better be ready.
The same applies to Derpy and the new voice. I can't accept that either.
do you hate my brother(he hates MLP FIM)
cause i do :P
and last(cause my brother wants my PC)
actually hate or just doesnt like
did you liked my question game?
he hates
More Luna!
HATEZ

Thus they each only stream "their" shows
one pice is best
I already signed a petition to save derpy

roboyts can blush o.O

Atleast for 2013
CCCP: no, its not a defnitive time line, it just means that for next year, they have plans

yo Meanwhile
hi and happy derpy day :)
eh, the only anime I've watched for a long long time was Fate Zero and that's not had any new episodes in a while
Cya.
hiya LC
How are we all?
BritishBrony I've not finished Revil4 yet, I probably should
0,5How is everypony?
00,10Heya LC
|I finished it on normal ages ago. I'm playing it pro now.
LC muufffiiiiiiiiiiins
0,5Hiya Sumica
13sumica... you asked where i was at 5am... i would be sleeping of course....
Shizuka: but you don't sleep.
oh hai ~ Good afternoon everypne ~
im good, how are you this fine evening
13i sleep like the dead..
ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
I like revil 4, leaps and bounds better than any other revil game I've played, with only revelations as the exception
13:<
i'm good
hiya TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Allo TheGreatAndPowerfulT
I'm probably getting a full night of sleep tonight too, so goodbye for today.
also happy derpy day i guess ~
I dont think i will be able to sleep tonight.
http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
BritishBrony|British, its not even 9pm, seriously bed already?
RE4 is only RE game I have played.
Derpy day ist best day
^
so true
RE4 is great, Revelations is amazing.
Shizuka!
/me hugs Shizuka
I'll probably try to sleep but I doubt I'll be able to.
hiya Sumica what's up?
I've got a friend who loves the games... I always prefered Silent Hill, but Revil 4 and Revelations are the ones that I actually like enough to compare to Silent Hill
And I said it, I'm not going to bed now. I'm going to play RE4.
:3
00,10Dreading going in to work today.
Sumica: why?
Even if I've spent all of today traveling, and looking after kinder
dat was PERFECT
trolled
lol
Sumica how come?
why Sumica ?
ohh FMA ~
poor bastard
00,10cause I am exausted, this is day 7 in a row
then the birds blows up
ouch, no weekend break?
Sumica: y u no sleep?
Harsh.
Well, Good Night everypony. See ya all tomorrow.

Night Scavender
00,10oh I sleep but I have been working my arse off.

The WOAHHH is the ping of sumica
i wrote the whole thing.. ic
ok now i feel like a fool :/
hehe, funny ping
Sumica: well I know of that feeling and inb4 WOAH!
Erebus: it's Sumica's ping
Heh 15 ish seconds of lag between chat and my stream
so we will never get derpy back?
Derpy didn't go anywhere.
CCCP: derpy was changed for that one episode only
derpy never left silly filly
00,10the change was only for that ep.
she will still derp
Ingwaz: so her eyes will still be the same?
there will may be some changes with her voice or her name.. but derpy will stay in the show
derpy's just not called by name and they uncrossed her eyes and redubbed her
if shes ever given a speaking voice, she'll most likely get the female voice that she was originally intended to have, and she most likely will not get the canon name derpy, but her eyes should remain the same
cccp yes
Derpy's gonna derp
made out of the guys under Marcoh
she will derp in future episode
Ingwaz if ya watch the edit of the episode she's underped
but they never call her derpy anymore :'(
we still call her derpy
most likely, if she is given a name, it will be ditzy doo
They only called her Derpy once anyway. Is it really that big a deal
Inquisitor: she was mostly underped, not all the way
So I'm wondering, are they never going to put Derpy in episodes with derped eyes past this point again?
that episode only
"Well I stole your face"
Because that kind of sucks.
No they probably just won't name her again.
good morning, i got work to do so ding me if you need me
Hey otakon
i am 99% sure she will derp
00,10they said no change to her eyes past this ep, but time will tell
Derpy was in Hearts and Hooves day
everything they've said indicates that it was only for the last round up, not for any other eps
Yeah, they also denied that anything was being changed with Derpy to start with.
We'll just have to pay extra attention during the next episode to see if she's there
cccp: WHERE?!
And look how that turned out.
00,10seeing as all the eps were already made by this point any ways
Yeah?
I forget which though
ha
Iwubponiez: she is hidden in the background with Dr Whooves. Its in one of the parts where u see Ponyville from a birds eye veiw right after the cmc sing
I'm not sure whether that's depressing or not.
HAH, awesome.
cccp: oh forgot that for a min
hmmm
she was in a friend in deed to
too
I don't like this intro tbh
Did they put her with dr whooves for us?
What's steaming? Because I was already watching something else when I loaded chat up.
Who turned out the lights?"
it was not her eyes, unfortunately it was just a perfect storm of 3 factors, but the name derpy was the biggest
http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/funny-graphs-why-i-am-interested-in-the-multiverse-theory.jpg
That's cool
Dr Who references. Me gusta. :>
indeed xles
dat panda
lol
I've never thought derp ment retarded I always thought it ment an embarassing mistake
xles: yes
I'm in the green
it's just a cat
xles: suddenly i'm interested the multiverse theory
Sumica: the animation is looser in this one
=D
well i thing they wont make any changes... or choose 4 option...
run forset run!
*forest
and Inquisitor to many it does not, but to a small few it does, and hasbro did not want to use a character name that could be used as a slur for mental retardation
P.S The word "derpy" got no defination in the dictonary
00,10creepy old man in drag
creepy
i cannot blame them for that
check urban dictionary
look it up , not found
What are you lot watching?
thats a legit old lady
derpy is not in dictonary.com
or my dictonary book
derp probably is though
what is this
Because that's Sweetie Belle
kitty :p
no derp isn't there
go see
alexxm: is 12 and what is this?
what show is this
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=derpy
derp was coined by south park with making fun of rob schnider's movies... hence another reason I took it to mean "embarassing mistake"
here
Inquisitor: makes sense
00,10It's Full metal alchemist
Brotherhood
ok thanks
how far in are we
and then he blows up the map
Onyxiaz: 3 defintition says it means "retarted"
can we stop talking about Derpy... its really getting on my nerves...
00,10ep 32
alexxm: about half way through the series
indeed, its sad but in some ways, it is used to mean retarded, so i do not blame them for the change
i am torn on whether or not they should give her the name ditzy doo as they originally intended though
Ditzy is no better
ok is it just me or does the guy in the white suite looking like rossiu
it might anger the fans, or they might take it as a nod and attempted apology to the fandom
alexxm: enope
sorry Midnight_Tempest but my Soap Box instinct against censorship of any kind sometimes is too strong for me
otakon, being ditzy isnt something thats like mental retardation
I reckon Ditzy is probably a lot better.
Since Derpy apparently means retarded and Ditzy means spacey, and the like.
dude looks like a lady
They should just keep Derpy as a character thats in the background with no lines
lady IS a dude
Still
Derpy is what we made of it
it didn't HAVE to mean retarded
Guys, call Professor Oak, he needs to solve this
indeed otakon, and to the fans, she will always be derpy
but it ended up going that route
damn, he creepy
brb
its sad, i dont like it completely, but i understand why they did it, so i respect it
Ingwaz: eeyup, most people interpret it as "clumsy" not "retarded"
yet the minority that take it as "retarded" got their way.
is video working for you guys?
eeyup
Oh cool! FMA!!
yes Coolbluemidnite
Coolbluemidnite: refresh you foal
^
Lt. General Grumann
Mwuhahaha
In fairness though the people who're offended by the name aren't really part of the fandom.
-evil laugh-
Meanwhile: yh
Meanwhile: some of them are, you cannot concretely say none of them are
i gotta leave... cya all
damn
ugh, hate my g;asses
the last thing I'll say about this whole Derpy thing... What kind of people would take it to the corporation to change something like this? I mean you have to read it, interpret it, and discuss it to come to the worst possible conclusion and yet people thing it's obvious enough for other people to instantly get their line of logic to be offended... it makes not sense to me, not only that is that the state of affairs in the us
bye Onyxiaz come back soon
sorry for wall of text
Panda
hai guys
What we watching? :3
and the problem is not that it was a minority that complained, the problem is that the word derp is recognized by enough people to not mean clumsy but mentally retarded
Full Metal Alchemist
mmk tyuh
Ingwaz: yeah, so we change the meaning of the word back?
oh cool fullmetal
00,10Suddnly armstrong

Riker and Capt. Jack are similar
Jack Harkness is William Riker. Now canon.
Riker flirts with ALL the ladies
Jack flirts with ALL the EVERYTHING

What is the greatest lie every created? What is the most vicious obscenity ever perpetrated on mankind? Slavery? The Holocaust? Dictatorship? No. It's the tool with which all that wickedness is built: altruism. - Derpy Hooves

emangamer: Because.
ohai Saigneur
that music
horse lol\
O.o
oh god
poneh
like Meanwhile said
emangamer: tired....work kinda took over
Meanwhile: umm....so this is an alternate time line?
Doctor Who is a brony.
wuts up with random ads
emangamer: no
>.<
Octavias_Pride: oh, well I'm sorry
emangamer: no
that friggin music
get adblock Derping
:'(
Derping, they just happen, adblock ftw
so why cant he visit her just an hour earlier then...
/me is so friggen confused
emangamer: they CANT its a fixed point
whre can i haz adbloc 6_9
emangamer: just cause
emangamer: Because that would be interfering with the proper timeline
firefox
emangamer: Wibbley wobbley timey wimey.
emangamer: he would see himself and everything.
Snuffsis: havne't they already fucked with the timeline
Dat double killcam gamewinner
:P
emangamer: it would cause a paradox and destroy existence
What Snuffis says is true.
emangamer: no, because according to the timeline that was supposed to happen from that spaceship and everything.
otakon: not if he travels to a different time...right
emangamer: no, bc he can't do it.
dear doctor: i have crabs...
bleh...
Derping: hahah
emangamer: the doctor has a very important rule to NEVER go to a timeline he has visited once before.
Fail
lol
Derping: get yourself checked
Snuffsis: but it's all one timeline
He did that once in season 1 with Rose, and it almost ended the universe
what we watching?
StickySyrup but i haz no crabs i haz lobster
Doctor Who
AWESOME
Derping: Gordan Freeman: Headcrabs?
this is doctor who?
i want some lobster..
emangamer: think of it this way, it's all ONE timeline but he can't intersect his OWN timeline
;~;
one of the best series out there
Omg yes police box
yes headcrabs StickySyrup
emangamer: Yes, but seeing oneself and interacting with that timeline could/would cause a paradox.
O.o
dat picture
I didn't ask headcrabs
One does not simply crab a head.
SATALITE OF LOVE
damn it that music is so friggin sad
emangamer: Rose did that in season 1, and it almost destroyed the timeline. :P

Good luck Scavender
emangamer: time is weird, i agree, but he can never (well he can, but never do) cross his own timeline.
where there the strange robot-human things that Yanto was hiding at Torchwood HQ?
I absolutely Adored the first episode I saw, so this one was a bit of a let down
/me just finished Bioshock
Suddenly, RAWRity
night Scavender
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3qS0odekuU&feature=related
ohai RAWRity
ohh snaz
Harrrhar.
Hey RAWRity :)
Snuffis have you heard og the five doctors
Ohey Sonic
Hello RAWRity
Bioshock was weird. I liked the story, but it kind of abruptly ended
Ohhai
Since when is Professer X in this show?
hi RAWRity
yay
alexxm: hmm?
Allo RAWRity.
Enter, the Cyberman
yeah these guys
just got home, good afternoon everypony!
look it up the doctor teams up with 5 past versions of himself
otakon: that was epic
Allo KernelCobb
00,03Hurray for SimCity5!
I know it was
alexxm: ah yes, The 5 Doctors. a classic.
Happy Derpy Day
what??
hey KernelCobb
huh.
there's also, The Three Doctors
they
that vulcan!
did he died?
lol that face as he died XD
woooo minecraft update
ohai KernelCobb, really? :o
alexxm: really? well, that must have been because of a really important thing. (was it in the new version of doctor who?)
Remind me again what Dr. Who is about?
old version i think
Just made an amazing technological breakthrough? Better show it to the British.
Because he has a rule to never cross his own timeline, that i know.
yea, Jim, check it out on minecraftforum.net
alexxm: aah, that explains it then. :P
Snuffsis: no, it's old Classic Who
It was during the 5th Doctor's run.
Aww mickey...
T_T
flutter_spin: oh your mind will be so fucked.....
Explosions!
It's akin to the Team Up episodes they had every season in Power Rangers
I heard Dr. Who is way beyond awesome weird
LOOK OUT HERE COMES TOM
flutter_spin: wibbley wobbley timey wimey
directed by Michael Bay
SCIENCE
rawrity: i tried watching doctor who from the very start, but gosh darnit, i don't have enough free time for that. xD
Fiction
And black and white, not really a fan of that haha
Tell me, can it be compared to Sliders?
so if time is wibbley wobbley timey whimey stuff, what does that make the alternate timeline
She's dead
esplosions
JIM
Its dead.
NOT THE TARDIS!?
its dead, jim
wait...Are you trying to tell me it's dead?
R.I.P the TARDIS
emangamer: I've got a newsflash for you. Time is wimey, there is no alternate line.
Yes Jim
Snuffsis: well, you really CAN'T watch it from the start. Most of the First 2 doctors' episodes were destroyed or lost.
Were in Camp Nowhere :P
haha
Its worse than that, Its Windows, Jim =w=
And then they start the canniblism
RAWRity: really? damn that sucks
I knew I shouldn't have left it out in the first place...
brb need coffee
Rawrity: I found a torrent with every episode though, with the first and 2nd doctor.
to sunny to be London...
LOL. You mean the whole station is in that little phone box?
awesome
It was a bout 300gb or something. xD
Meanwhile: umm.......what?
BEAUTIful :I
OH THE HUMANITY
WOAH!!!!
I wish we still had that...
that phonebooth location is completely inconspicuous
Does anyone know a free image editor that is not GIMP?
FRINGE.. I mean wut?
Snuffsis: every episode that's survived perhaps, but there's big chunks missing through a lot of em.
amirite?
steampunk
StinkomanFan: i see what you did there
Gimp 3.6
but still Snuffis i gave 2 examples of the doctor deblitaly creating a paradox
<3 steampunk
/me thinks about it
Rose: "my dad is alive...Woopee"
00,03I prfer Steam Boy
otakon: that's how the BBC operated back them. Show an episode once, then burn that celluloid like it's going out of style.
So... her father started Zeplins?
00,03prefer*
Rawrity: Maybe, but still, the first episodes survived atleast. :P
trust me!
I'm the doctor
O.o
00,03Trust me, I be a doctor!
/me menacing voice
:'(
/me remembers The Wall's "Trust Us" thingy
...I was about to stay that Scootaloo.
Scoot-Scootaloo: stay away from my prostate.
I've never really watched this show, but i'm guessing Derpy Hooves represents Rose?
I'm an advertisement, not a doctor
/ninja'd
Trust me on this I'm on an ad
DAT CAR
00,03:D
DAT MANSION

he calls it his old man car

emangamer: Probably. Ask Doctor Whooves.

Meanwhile: touche...
RoflBot: [16:57:14] Does anyone know a free image editor that is not GIMP? Hencfe the words NOT GIMP.
lol
Lol!
emangamer: No, there are only alternative universes where there are different versions of humans and such.
I said Gimp 2.6
They spelled Princess Celestia wrong
Multiverse theory, if you ever heard of it?
6_9
^
it's the same damn thing!
Are women REALLY that concerned about their age?
PinkiePieCopy: paint.net

Shut up Mickey
it doesn't have to
Or it could be the SIDRAT
00,03Remember... No Russian
there was no Rose, remember
flutter_spin: touche
TARDIS is forever alone.
In that alternative universe, maybe.
00,03inb4 steampunk
^
Since it would mean there is an alternate doctor, but it's also a chance the doctor never stole the TARDIS in that universe and so on.
/me instantly reminded of Bioshock: Infinite
00,03^
yup
In an alternate reality we all have pones, think about that for a moment
Awesome! They postponed the big update to the PSN until a later Dat :D
Old phone is suddenly High definition

So, there is an old Dr. Who? and a new Dr. Who?

Seems legit.
yes
/me is now hungry .~.
They seem trustworphy!
yay!!
Scoot-Scootaloo: Really??
They got candy!
Who's that short guy?
Suddenly, DeadlyDerp3
00,03YES! 
He couldn't actually destroy them since the Time war raged over several different eras all through space and time, he could only lock them away.
"Expiriments? FUCK THAT! FOOD!"
hai DeadlyDerp3
candy van, boss mode
It's a trap.
O_O
Why? :3
They're probably eating Scootaloo.
o.o
random guy qith a truck promises food? Seems totally legit.
Well, why ask for help when you are an IDIOT
Snuffsis: oh yea. and the timelords are evil. but then the master returned them all to earth so that all the timelords could become the master.
THEY'RE EATING HER

I HOLD THE FATE OF MAN
She's searching up the data with her MOTOROLA
Rolamota
Snuffsis: then why did the doctor want to keep the timelords from returning
It's just that the Time War brought them to the brink of extinction that they thought they had to sacrifice some to revive themself.
Well hai everypony.
emangamer: because they went loony.
hey Aircrafter
Hello Aircrafter
Meanwhile: so they ARE evil

Those earbuds are the equivalent of an Ipod touch.
Everyone has one.

Meanwhile: yh, your right
Do we all go to the same equestria or alternate equestrias to our liking?
otakon: you're*
would be funny if when you died remembered your last life but...when you got a new one you would be a pony in Equestria :D
and riots means future socialism
id like to beleave that we go to equestria, it's better than sitting here thinkging about just dying and sitting in the dirt forever
