4. Power up your boulder.
13ahh that's a good mechanic tradeoff
13hit stuff to get gold to upgrade the boulder, but means it does less to the gate at the end
Shizuka: so the more things you hit the weaker your boulder becomes
hmm good mechanic

Okay so you can't break through the stone wall but you can easily crush the house that's right up against the stone wall.
This game is interesting.

SpadeKyurem[School]: Because this always happens http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png

This reminds me of Wii Golf somehow.
But this is probably more fun
CHEATING
only a little tap though
GIT HIM Sumica!
Damn luck
YOU CAN DO IT!
Soooo exacly what's the point of putting this stuff down yourself if YOU'RE going to destroy it?
YES!
Does it earn points?
Like in Angry Birds?
GottaHugEmAll: actually no I was wrong you don't roll into your own stuff
but the enemy has UNLIMITED funds it seems
The game cheats

We crushed it with a rock
As told by Manowar

Death?
Why would Death do an epic medieval song?
Considering that the front man is..you know..dead.
WTH

THE COMPUTER IS A CHEATING BASTARD!
I wonder what game has the most cheating AI
I think so Sumica

Welp

/me noms brownie
/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
00,10oh I know every one poke Phase4 to stream
MadSurge: It's not Pokemon, you silly. It doesn't work the same.
/me pokes Phase4 :3
00,02?
MadSurge: Comparing Digimon to Pokemon is dumb.
00,02i'm busy being clever
Trying to be clever*
<:
MadSurge: And what do you mean confusing?
Gold_Demona: maybe that's why I don't care for Digimon :D
/me balances a spoon on Jmo's nose :3
The digimon evolutions make perfect sense if you're not trying to compare it to Pokemon
Digivolutions are more like "battle forms" than actual evolutions.
Then why aren't they called "battle forms"?
MadSurge: Because that's boring?
Why does it matter @_@
IKR?
Because I am whiny and want to be polemic D:
Quit being whiny before I hurt you.
/me ties Jmo down to the floor with duct tape :<
I wanted a digimon back in those days. :<
Bad Jmo, hurting people is not nice :|
And I'm supposively nice?
O__O IM GETTING TIRED D:
Gold_Demona: one in particular?
/me taps a spoon on Jmo's head :>
But wait... if I miss school I will have teh weekend to do my projects...
MadSurge: Either Gatomon or Wizardmon.
How about you just do the damn project?
MadSurge: They're both champion level though, so I'd probably have their respective smaller forms. :P
and also the fact that I have 3 tests and Im feckin tired
Wizardmon? was it a Black Mage expy? :D
MadSurge: expy? O_o
Jmo: I cant function without sleep and I have teh project and 3 tests today.
Gold_Demona: a very similar looking character
:D
That's your own fault.
I find it funny that most people in my time zone are just ending their days when I've just started mine. (it's almost 6am here) XD
MadSurge: Ah yeah. He does look similar to a black mage.
did stream die?
Gold_Demona: same here

In which context?
Phase4, a transfor - oh ok... :D
Nvidia optimus GPU for mobiles?
Phase4 gmod is giving me the shits

00,02nvidia optimus allows your computer to run things on either the intergrated gpu or the dedicated
00,02it turns the dedicated gpu off when not needed
Phase4 can you help me
00,02it has to decide ahead of time what runs where, it does this by executable name
00,02'Updater.exe' is one of those names listed to run on the dedicated
i cant get gmod to reconize the mlp pack or any packs anymore

Marceline is best queen :$
00,02no one share them >_>
00,10we got high winds here
00,10like trashcans blowing out in to the street high winds
Jake I would kill for snow around here, sure it's cold, but snow is rare around these parts
luck you D:
lucky, even
I feel bad for those Kirbys PB killed
They were so innocent.
oh wow the german mlp team really likes dutch
Where do you live, Deacon?
00,02that'll take a while
they keep using their intro

Deacon: I live even further south. I'm in Florida. :D

i liver more north than you Gold_Demona
i'm in the middle of europe
well a little bit north from there
aniderp: If you live in the US, that's not a difficult feat. :D
I live south of the middle of Europe :D
one time i went to florida... then i came back home to it snowing ;_;
Snow is nice and all...
00,02hmm
00,02i wonder
00,02oh well
but it just...y'now...gets in the way all the time
but nice warm and swimming to coats again
00,02that will also take a while
...I always come back home to snowing...
I've never lived in a place that snows. I was born in Southern California, where if you want to play in the snow, you drive to the mountains.
i was 16 when i went
pony_1054 and it's cold -_-
And the rest of my life I've lived here in Florida, where snow is all but nonexistent. :D
00,02<< this is a lot of what technical work is
It's cold here, too
00,02waiting for copys/installs to complete
00,02ohai shana
The lowest it dips around here usually is down into the 30s F. Don't know what that is in Celsius.
00,02Gold_Demona, about 0 iirc
heh heh heh
00,0230 something is the freezing point of water
32
00,02close enough
how long will it take to fix todays episode?
I say: 3 minutes
00,02Jake, o_O
Yeah, it only goes that low here for like a day or two.
stupid negative degrees outside
hi Phase4
Phase4: they put in the wrong intro
also im removing the ads
The rest of "winter" the highs will flip flop between 40s and 70s.
00,02Jake, wrong intro on?
mlp
german mlp
00,02XD
Gold_Demona: that sounds like a smashing winter! :O
Gold_Demona then it get's unreasonably hot
MadSurge: Perfect cold and flu weather, I tell you what. :D
its about -10 F outside, not too cold...but still cold
ok aaand go!
It got to -40 F one year here in my neck of the woods. without windchill
Deacon: Yeah, no kidding, the rest of the year we have a lovely 90+ degrees and a bajillion percent humidity.
Literally. All year
-40 happens every year here
00,02you silly people and your imperial measurments
Gold_Demona: We go sometimes below zero celsius, but it's also really humid and it adds to the cold :(
The empire strikes back, I guess?

Then again, spent 5 hours trying to get a god darn soundcard to work yesterday.. So many Sigmatel drivers tested..
Derpy well that didn't take long, then again, it is running in ineficient hardware
http://fail0verflow.com/blog/2012/wiiu-teaser.html
How exactly large are the Wii U games, anyway?
yes alexxm i know
you ok Jake
Wii U took less time than hacking an Apple product
i dont know anymore
Dear god, Nintendo.
hey, at least they're utelizing the internet now, which other competitors did years ago
Phase4: Seen "banned from tf2 today"?
00,02XAX, nope

00,02Spell-of-Gaming, oh?
00,02hacked already
00,02?
Phase4: It's hilarious.
i just finished the flutterstalker blog it takes heavier stuff to shock me
Jmo: >tfw no slap function
Need a tissue?

alexxm, I LOVE THESE Twisted princess
flutterstalker is nothing
00,02distracted by cake

so nothing new
Jake, go read Background Pony
00,02shana, ah
it may not shock you but dang
CrystalPhoenix i'd say the mulan one was my favorite as it reminds me of my favorite film the crow
i also read art of distress
The cake is a spai
lucky you, phase4
CrystalPhoenix: Yeah, just go read it. Should only take a night.
>_>
00,02shana, so now we're waiting for a wii -> wii u mode exploit or a native one
Cake? Better put ice cream on it.
XAX it would take second if you were shitti
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, it has fresh cream

When I emulate GBA games on Wii, it gives me a slight eye strain
Jmo XP
I'm gonna go now..
00,02used to be clever use of stuff
00,02now its mostly hobby electronics news
00,10Oh I know this one
why don't you sing along Sumica :)
Huh?
Due to the fact that the TV has stupid video settings
lookit you, you tech-savvy folks
Or either the TV being crappy overall
I'm not tech savvy. I'm completely lost. :D
But I nod and smile like I understand what they're talking about. :>
00,02so aparently valve broke the gmod servers
Spell-of-Gaming or because the VBAGX kinda sucks at emulation GBA game properly
'Murica
buck yeah
I tend to do the same, Gold. :c
I leave you guys with this http://su.pr/23oCcO
tourlou now
00,02ip: 198.71.92.231
00,02steam got all confused
00,02awww
00,02updates
VBAGX lags/freezes a frame for a milisecond sometimes
It lags for a second, though.
Oh god, that track brings back memories.. Shocking memories
the framerate isn't that good for most games either
I hate it when it lags on Kirby
Oh dear god
Dubstep song for an ice cream
bleh
Never playing that game again.. Ever
if i can trust my cpu meter emulatin a ds game needs 20% power and emulating a snes game <1%
ice cream and cake and cake?
So I'm gonna go for now. Thank you all for the welcome. Might be back later, maybe under a different nick or something.
I have a sudden urge for ice cream sandwich
Or something.
alright, seeya then Blarg
ok bai then Blarg

00,02can someone here with garrys mod try connect to 198.71.92.231
00,02password is ponies
Nop
<:

O:
gimmie 5 mins
How can people not have Steam these days
dafuq
I would, but my laptop kinda sucks at doing it
heading out to the shops back soon
this laptop wont be able to handle it
I can understand having a few games only for Steam but
heading out to the shops back soon
No Steam?
/me is asahamed and sits in corner ;_;
/me huggles aniderp
Steam isn't for everyone
00,02steams probably the best game distribution service out there right now
00,02theres a few with less drm or more of different types of games but meh
00,02dat failed password
is tf2 free?
00,02dat double failed password o_O
and the games are tax free!
Yep, free-to-play since.. Can't remember
00,02ohai Revolution08
TF2 is free, yes.
00,02password is ponies
how do i connect to this ip
is steam free to get though? -shot-
00,02Jake, cant remember how it works in gmod, open the console and type connect 198.71.92.231
00,02aniderp, yup
Yes it is aniderp.
Origin needs my payment information, even though my game is already free because of a coupon, are you serious
00,02Revolution08, how you fail at ponies
aniderp: Yes, Steam and TF2 are both free.
It's already free of tax
and how can i open the console Phase4
i need a new laptop for lots of new things and steam
00,02Jake, press ~
00,02same as the ` key
00,02above tab
Phase4: i typed connect 198.71.92.231 ponies but it didnt work
LOl
00,02Revolution08, password ponies then connect
in a running game or in menu?
cup of flour
vanilla
So I've seen a lot of clips made with Gmod - But how does it actually work? (Never seen it "played" before)
One does not simply play Gmod.
*Watches stream intensely*
00,02Revolution08, open the console, type 'password ponies' then 'connect [ip]'
I'm still confused with gmod
Yeah, you REALLY have to know what you're doing to make anything in gmod. >.>
how does the tf2 ponies thing work?
i wanna be a pony when i get it..
Magic.
:3
aniderp: It's a mod.
all the mods free?
i dont know this stuff D:
It's a simple mode, one person is chosen to be the pony and has to kill your team, if you aren't the pony your objective is to kill ze pony. If you're the pony, vice versa.
Mods are free.
aniderp: They better be. They're fan made. :D
And are automatically downloaded when you connect to one of the services.
Ohh, Half-life interface - That I do know
heeeeeeeellooo
/me is stupid
Phase4: i can connect but how do i enter the password?
lali-ho LyraHeartstrings
You aren't stupid aniderp :P
Jake: type "password ponies" before connecting

Gmod isn't TF2

i thought it was tf2
aniderp: Nope
i dont know about this stuff ;_;

05evenin buckers
Hai Wrek! =D
lali-ho Wreky
Alright. My need for a new computer has now become an emergency. This laptop's been glitching out more and more lately, but this is the first time it's affected Bronystate. And I DO accept all responsibility for what just happened.
dem birds
Ohai Wrek - Saw the latest drawing result today! Pwetty stuff
05^ becasue its a big deal when spacebar gets stuck
05thanks Canebridge :3
Also grats on EQD feature, Wrek
05ill be honest
05EqD isnt suc ha milestone anymore
heh
05like
05it botehrs me whe ni get in there and peopel make these long comment lists
05and skip commenting mine :C
:C
That sucks. :<
They have no taste. >:C
05but it does have ~280 faves in less than a day
My plans for moving off this laptop will have to include a full F-Disk on the internal hard drive. If mom saw that whole video driver crashiness the other day, she'd throw a well-justified fit.
05and 23 comments
05so im happy
I see Garry's Mod and Garry's Mod 9 - Which one?
05it seems i get more traffic from derpibooru and otehr sources
hi
Wrek, how did your drawing of Vinyl turn out?
lali-ho Octavia6666
i like this song -shot-
I like it too, aniderp :>
we are the cutie mark crusadersssss
00,02anyone know hwow to scale items?
00,02how'
00,02TO GOOGLE
wasn't there an item sizer?
There's not a tool for that, Phase4?
00,02Gold_Demona, if there is i cant find it
Now downloading Gmod :)
Canebridge, which version?
05also
Version?
btw if i do get steam.. my name will probly be Anime
The free one requires Half Life 2. The paid version doesn't
if that name isnt taken xD
05mfw sabaton will play live in Umeå next month
That will probably be taken aniderp :P
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1354278296331.jpg I wouldn't want to shoot anything.
But you can still give it a try.
oh
I got the 10 dollar one *shrugs*
00,02Canebridge, 13
in a few years i will try to get steam
aniderp, why a few years?
this laptop wont be able to handle it
it shuts off :\
Imma try log onto the server when I can - I'll probably be derping around though, hurr
tryed to play sims 3 a few times.. it shut off each time
/me wants a laptop... even though she already has two computers...
Egh laptop users.
I think laptops are neat. :>
now Phase4
they're portable!
^
why do i have a ping of 300
Gold_Demona, my laptop is my third computer. My other two are much less powerful than this.
Only for browsing and small things.
Laptops be for studies - While at home, huge giant stationary PC *nods*
Anything more they're useless.
i should get a computer account on downstairs computer?
but... the one i had is bad with no net cause mother screwed it up years ago..
though I would prefer to buid a PC
Yeah, that's fun.
so when someone logged on.. i will delete old one and make myself a new one just in case
05btw aniderp
aniderp: computer account? wut?
05accoutn names are not display anems on steam
pretty good drawing Wrek :)
we have a computer downstairs..its shared
You can have ANY display name on steam.
14%.. Sooon
Dat ragdoll
I was using "I have to return some videotapes" as a steam name for a while lol
Character limit is huge
That business card.
lol
Jmo: Oh my god.
"That's bone"
the guys from tf2
Eggshell...
lol
Heavy kerbals?
You like Huey Lewis and the news?
Eh, nothing to do.
I do!
Ace of Spades.
Huey Lewis is awesome :>
Gold_Demona: IT'S HIP TO BE SQUARE.
i have a friggin horrible cold :'(
XAX, that's an awesome steam name.
Anyone who disagrees is wrong and should go to bread.
Huey Lewis isn't awesome.
<:
Kandarihu: Lol. CSS cut the s off the end of videotapes when I got ingame. Still a large name.
XAX: So hip!
Jmo, you are wrong and should go to bread.
Never.
I'm in bread.
XAX, That makes it even sillier. Awesome.
wait...
is amnesia on steam?
aniderp, yes
It is
free?
Yeah.
Nope
No.
aniderp, no
;_;
not all games are free
Looking at a basic car tutorial while downloading - I like the idea of this game!!
Most games aren't free
TF2 is one of the exceptions.
so i pay for it then i get everything?
but wait until a sale comes around for a low low price, 75% off even
Anyone heard of Humble THQ Bundle?
Phase4: Any good with wiremod?
<-
aniderp: Basically how it works is you buy a game and it downloads into your Stream library, and you can play it from there.
are their cards for steam at the store?
In USA? Usually.
aniderp: You mean gift cards?
yes
you can also use your credit/debit to buy things
Gold_Demona, it shows up in your library, and from there you can download it and launch it from there too.
05i signle hadnedly fought off 5 guys and a sunderer
05as ifniltrator
Er, aniderp, I meant that to you.
Kandarihu: I know this. I'm trying to explain it to aniderp. :P
lol
Gold_Demona, yes. Sorry. I have a habit of pinging the wrong person when correcting less than perfectly accurate explanations instead of the person the explanation is for.
aniderp: I've never tried looking for actual physical gift cards for Steam... You should check your local video game store to see if they exist. =/
or eletronic store
aniderp, only at Best Buy and Gamestop
eww, gamestop :s
I mean wut
Shyaddap Mojay. Go to bread
;_;
Dema why you being so mean to me tonight
;__;
Is it possible to make a rollercoaster?
its not a free country
*Sizzling with many crazy ideas for Gmod already*
they lie..
Cuz I'm in a mean sort of mood. XP
:<
Writer's block is making me mean
And you take it out on me. I see how it is.
Yup. Because I wub you Mojay. :>
;___;
aniderp, we are not our politicians. Most of the morons who voted Obama in really didn't understand the issues.
i voted for obama..
since romney is horrible
They're BOTH horrible. So I didn't vote at all
i would have voted for derpy
I think I'd rather have Twilight in office than Derpy.
well atleast we have rights since rmoney isnt president
Right. Let me try to put it better. Most if not all of the people who voted to reelect Obama fell for all of the character assassination propaganda against Romney
Stupid mudslinger ads
my work place would be gone if romney was president :\
its a work/program place
aniderp, do you really believe all this?
Honestly, I don't think Obama's gonna be any better
how about.. i run for president? :D
Yay!~
/me votes for aniderp
there was an ad in our local area to not vote for amendment 4, but it was to take out anything that was mentioned to jim crow laws since they're not being used, and the ad didn't even mention that
and ponies and zelda be all over the office!
Yay!
aniderp, you fall for propaganda hook line and sinker. I wouldn't trust you in office.
i honestly didnt want to vote :\
I didn't vote
/me voted for Romney, and proudly
/me did his voting already for the first time
/me starts making her campaign thingys
wow Phase4
you dun goffed
well i'm going to go to over due sleep. nighty everypony
it was my first time voting aswell
*Returns from watching tutorials* Big guns..?
what should be on the papers Gold_Demona ?
"Vote for me! I have muffins!" ? =D
good idea!
Muffins for everypony!
with picture of derpy
yay
:>
but what about the people who no like ponies? D:
i will have zelda ones also
They can have muffins too. :>
double yay!
Everypone gets muffins, even if they no lik ponies
Da heck is that thing
eletction day of bronystate
Interesting vehicle there
I think it needs some sort of braking system.
Weee!~
running for the freedom and lots of muffins is aniderp
Don't forget a helmet - Darn
You know what would be awesome? If someone plunked the Kerbal model into gmod.
00,02server lag
I wonder if animations from GMod could be imported into Source Film Maker.
Probably not
What was the details for getting onto the server?
Pwease!
does the president make lots of money?
aniderp: Eeyup. For the rest of his life
oooo
when can i become president?
iirc, if they get too rich, they have to be paid in cents
Work 4-8 years... Be rich the rest of your life...
can i watch ponies as my work?
and play games like zelda
president watching ponies, prolly more productive than what he does now....
lol
and then.. there wont be a first man >:)
vidja games
> : )
President watching ponies and being a food judge - Dream job
Gold_Demona, they still keep working until they have enough money to retire.
haters gonna hate
And there SHOULD never be such a thing as "too rich"
Kandarihu: Yeah, but they continue to get payment from being president.
Kandarihu: Even when they're not anymore
my first thing as president..
throw bieber in jail! xD
Gold_Demona, they get a free home and security service detail for the rest of their life.
Kandarihu: Yeah
aniderp but he's canadian
aniderp: deport him
yes1
what abotu rebecca black?
who?
exactly
she sings firday
friday
oh
aniderp, you'd be threatening every artist in the recording industry if you tried to punish Justin Bieber and Rebecca Black for the kind of music they do.
oh.. its friday today isnt it
lol
but
I honestly don't caer. :P
i will let adam lambert stay
who?
i work 3rd shift, i think its still tursday :/
he was 2nd
That tells me nothing. :D
i will gte a birdie
then who does?
Jim Henson
Seriously. You want to wage a war on Justin Bieber, his entire fanbase will rise up as a dreadful army in his name. But he won't be the one giving orders.
That man was awesome
not billy mays
he was annpoying
his fanbase are a bunch of little girls
Beliebers make weak agruments.
Gold_Demona: would you like a muffin? :>
[]DeadpoolDash, the vast majority of little girls. Would self-defense be enough justification to slaughter an entire gender of several generations? We'd have the gender disparity of China if it came to that.
aniderp: Why yes I would :>
*arguements
THEN I CRASH
I wub your car!
there are enough older girls to fill the gap
/me gives muffins out
dat Barney
Barney! =D
/me wubs Barney Calhoun
i miss him:'(
dammit Gabe.
can we kill the dinosaur?
Miss him? He didn't go anywhere
aniderp: You mean he's not dead already?
we should kill that dinosaur
aniderp: You mean he's not dead already?
i dont know D:
trust me, if we REALLY needed to repopulate the country we could do it in a weekend easy
I haven't seen him in years
5% to go! Will I also need to download something when I enter the Gmod?
arrest justin bieber and give him to my freidn
she would be happy
It seems to me that Barney the Dinosaur was created in rebellion to the dark age of media that permiated the media. Bear that in mind.
and i will make peace with all countries when i become president
aniderp: lol, good luck with that. :P
and continents
you will become continents?
aniderp: By making peace with all countries, you are by default making it with the continents as well.
we will all be happyyyy
technically speaking
and no wars
What? You'll make peace with Antartica?
sure!
No wars with the penguins
lolz at no war, someone will try to take power from you
am i suppose to?
aniderp, Obama's already trying to make peace with the countries who are 100% committed to our destruction. George W Bush tried to do that to a limited extent to offset his bad reputation.
no animal abuse will be tolerated
and if the pet does get abused they can attack the owner
aniderp, what is the role of government to you?
00,02aparently i'm a fish
uhhh
am i suppose to know this stuff?
LOL Barney's a fish. :D
Hey Fishy4, what was the server IP?
You want to become President, don't you?
maybe!
Oh boy, politics? :|
and and
MadSurge: It never stopped. :P
sea ponies for everyone!
Canebridge: 198.71.92.231
Yay! Seaponies!
do i win now? :>
Thanks Shana - Off I go!
Gold_Demona: save me from this topic D:
MadSurge: Sorry, I'm too busy encouraging it. :D
You can't make peace with an ideology, you either stomp it out or make it extremely unbearable to follow. Stomping it out is the best and most permanent course.
Gold_Demona: can be vice p[resident
Stomping like a G6~
Woot! :D
then sea poniesss!
You still aren't MLG Scoot.
Uhh, what gamemode is it?
and jaymoo the attourney
The truth hurts, doesn't it Scoot.
!v1 me >: (

In what?
Woah wut?
Um.... some game you're not good at >_>
life
Because MLG's NEVER play fair~
Implying I have a life.
Lel.
lol
Gold_Demona: As long as you're not racist or in it only for your personal gain, I can tolerate conservatives :D
/me hugs Jmo
Good morning, everyone!
Mornin'
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo :)
mornin
stomp the ideology? Orks approve: http://images.wikia.com/warhammer40k/images/archive/0/02/20110512201600!Squiggoth.jpg
MadSurge: I'm "so neutral that nobody gets my vote". Does that count?
Problem is, conservatives are constantly accused of both of those things all the times, usually baselessly. AND PEOPLE BELIEVE IT!
Gold_Demona: :D nooo don't wast your vote!
muffins anyone? :D
Kandarihu: in Italy unfortunately THEY ARE :D
MadSurge: What do you mean waste?
Gold_Demona: not voting is wasting your vote D:
MadSurge: There's no point in me voting. I don't like any of the options.
MadSurge: Why cast my vote on an option I don't like?
Gold_Demona: pick the option you hate the least!
^
MadSurge: I honestly think that's the stupidest suggestion ever.
:|
gold not even mine when you're vice?
D:
lesser of two evils is still evil, but it is less evil
I refuse to vote for evil
Even if it's the lesser of two
but evil has cookies
nice has muffins
I liek muffins :>
I vote for muffins
so gmod's a game i thought it was a video maker thing?
obama gave me muffin :>
evil takes the muffins from the nice
alexxm: It's a game that people can make videos with
he didnt but
i will give muffins@
evil has muffins and cookies
thanks Gold_Demona
alexxm: It's a sandbox game. You can pretty much do anything on it. :D
Gold_Demona: can we own a pet wolf in white house?
aniderp: Nuuuu, wolf will eat us. D;
:< but they pretty
But they wild and hungry :<
husky then!
There's a reason there's no such thing as a domesticated wolf. >.>
Problem is that italian lefters are seen as spineless incompetents and righters are seen as obnoxious jerks that only aim to their personal gain. I still prefer the incompetent guys, you see?
not if you raise it from a cub
If I was President, I would install a Gun Range on the lawn and invite everyone shoot guns with me.
wait.. does the vice live in whitehouse also?
aniderp: I have no idea...
no
its like a manison there though D:
living under the same roof is a national security risk
Well, it makes sense. I wouldn't want to live with my coworkers. :D
you would have your own office!
and ponies and sea ponies and muffins
you usually dont want them in the same place, makes them easy targets to take both of them out in a single strike
oh
Kandarihu: I hope so
Kandarihu: as long as they care for the country, I disagree but can respect them
look up the term : Liberal, it has been twisted quite a bit over the years
most conservatives would have been called Liberals not too long ago
00,02yay storms

YAAAAY MONSTER SPAMMING :D
alexxm: yes, but you respawn on the spot
so it doesn't matter MadSurge?
Nope
death is an illusion

so it's like the lego star wars games then MadSurge?

I do Deadpool, so go lolz to your GW2 and quit trying to think for me.

Yeah now you're just being retarded.

I came here for ponies
turns out it is friday
so sad

How is everyone able to draw their pony with pencil/paper and not have eraser marks but I do?
It's likely due to the scanner settings
i have them too
greys can get blasted out
/me pats AttackWithHugs
Example
:>
scan
note the lack of smudges
photo with minimal smudging
but lots more aberations are present
ok
apparently I type too fast
Na, you press enter too much.
:|
ok
tl;dr: make some photoshop magic on it
basically
and that clever manouevre got me to 400 views. yay/
Lel I would but when I draw something with pen or pencil I intend to go over it in Photoshop but I never do....
well I just photograph them now
easier than scanning
guess im doing a lot of thing wrong
so I work hard to limit the amount of mess on the page
Aww Derpy :D

Um...
I found a great site for steampunk clothing and OH MY GOD DA FUCK IS ON STREAM!?
i no rite
TheRandomkid321, this isn't the first time you came back at a bad time, is it?
No... it's my 5th
Now I remember why I didn't like CatDog as a kid...
Is everything they do to their teeth happen to the others teth?
yep TheRandomkid321
AdamTheDuck shouldn't you be in bed?
Gold_Demona: why didn't you like it?
eww again
SMASHING!
monkey boy donnie
inb4 Smashing jokes
I always found this show boring as a kid...I do not know why...
VenHur Me too
blargharg time?
ARGH! I need that bloody steampunk gear!
Let me try to remember the shows that were on Nickelodeon before I turned 13 and decided to respect the "Kids Only" bump motif at the time: Danger Mouse, Inspector Gadget, David the Gnome... that's all I remember off the top of my head.
Are you afraid of the Dark?
I forget if Pinwheel was still on at the time.
That was a SNICK show, I believe...
I turned 13 in 1991.
lol, donnie
Did I spell that right?
yup
I was born in 1978. I was 2 when Reagan was elected. My childhood was awesome.
/me slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
Is that Tim Curry?
yes
I never noticed that before...
How did I not notice that before...
Well, okay. The era in which my childhood was in was awesome. Everything kept getting better and better and better still.
SMASHING! Sorry thought we were due for one
lol
Jmo: myuh
I never known that before...
Gold Demona took me ages to realise the dude from the Crystal Maze was Riff Raff
Sylandest: nyeh
/me slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
Sundaysmile: that who from what was who?
I heard of that show, some said it's one of the greatest game shows in the UK.
Crystal Maze - it's a game show - Riff Raff is the dude from Rocky Horror Show
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
Sundaysmile: Oh! I only watched that movie once so I don't remember everyone's names. XD
Is anyone else ADDICTED to steampunk?
Plus, the theme to the game show is AWESOME!
TheRandomkid321: Not I
TheRandomkid321: Don't get me wrong, steampunk is cool, but it is not among my addictions. :P
Anyone remember the Wild Thornberrys/Rugrats crossover movie?
Gold_Demona i do
i have it on dvd
alexxm: I liked that movie. :>
Oh no

We only see these people in the most embarrasing moments in their lives. Let's not assume that they are always this bad.
Females. You are the most crucial member in the reproduction process... FUCKING ACT LIKE IT!!!!!

VenHur, do you expect to be absolutely perfect about everything? Or are you going to live life scared and afraid to do anything out of fear of being caught on camera failing at something?
Bad idea!
Is that a...SEA PONY?!
ON G4?!
WHat part of you would think that that's a good idea?
shooby doo shoo shoo be doo
It's official, Sea Ponies are cannon.
VenHur, ... that is.
MadSurge, I've never done any of this stuff but I see it all online.
Plus, I'm afraid someone might be secretly filming me. That's why I dance only at home
AttackWithHugs: exactly! And for that you're a lady :3
/me slaps MadSurge around a bit with a large trout
MadSurge, a fun and crazy lady who rambles <3
Pfft, fun.
AttackWithHugs: I tend to act like Pinkie when excited, so I break into silly gigs often :D
Excuse me, Jaymo? Wanna repeat that a little louder? I didn't hear you.
It's official folks, I checked up the link, and based on the cover art, Seaponies and "Mermares" are now cannon.
I dance freestyle in public all the times because IDGARA! Also when I play those arcade games where you have a toy rifle and you pint it at the screen I pretend to get recoil on those and I always look down the sights... Hell there are probably 50+ vids of me online I don't know about.
/me hands Jmo a large seapony with which to slap people around with.
We all know Seaponies, but Mermares?
This man, knows well.
Seaponies sem like mermares
good evening bronystate :)
MadSurge, I've been told that I am the Pinkie Pie amongst my friends
Mayby SeaStallions and MerMares?
I said fluffeh, you aren't fun :3
Hey DaringDerpy! :D
DaringDerpy! DaringDerpy!
Haai DaringDerpy
Oh crud. Seaponies are G4 canon now!
:)
Hiyo DaringDerpy
AttackWithHugs: ergo the best friend to have :3
/me slaps Jmo with a boat "No moar pillows fer youuuuuuuu <3"

Hey scoots, what's the name of this song?

I can't find it on YT
Unless I'm overlooking
Intraventure by Navron AKA Navy_Brony
I swear the instant humans become cannon I BURN MY MLP TOYS!
harsh
what fi you're the human random
It said that the G4 Seaponies resides in an underwater city called Aquastria, ruled by King Leo, Princess Celestia's cousin.
im all squeaky clean now!
you get a portal to equestria
Ok nvm I found it
would you burn the actual ponies?
D:
I get a portal to equestria? I TEACH THEM ABOUT TACTICAL WAREFARE!
VenHur: that sounds like it would neat!
thsig gais a wannabe justiin beebre!
Hey, guys, what would you say if humans becomes cannon in the same way as G1?
You know, the whole well thing to the human world.
God Bless MURIKA.
VenHur... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
VenHur: Well?
You know what's coming...
ponies?
xD jk
zelda? :D
Boondocks?
Scoot-Scootaloo: Had you seen the cover art of "Under The Sparking Sea"? SEA PONIES ARE CANNON NOW!
Oh my God, I should do Boondocks!
But nah~
Yeah, I saw it VenHur, it's MLG as SHIZZLE
MLG?
MLG.
Scoot-Scootaloo, you MUST stream season 4 of Boondocks whenever it gets to YouTube.
Something he wishes to be.
Never heard of MLG.
AttackWithHugs: Damn Right, son/daughter/plant!

TheRandomkid321: Should you have?
TheRainbowDawn: >///<
Inb4 Hasbro gets hate mail for bringing G4 Seaponies.
shoo be doo
we love our sea ponies!
Whever people Tab me it fails.
WHY IS SEA PONIES BEING CANON A BAD THING???
I don't get it
YEAH NOW CANNIBALS CAN GO FISHING!
i don't either and i'm neutral on the whole seaponies thing\
The good news is that maaaaybe "Under The Sparkling Sea" might be a concept for an episode.
are they gonna shoo be do?
But why is it a bad thing? Plz explain.
shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
sea ponies :>
The even better news: Probally a remake of "Call Upon The Sea Ponies", or a different song entirely.
no not a new song ;_;
It all depends on fanservice.
we love the original song
right Gold_Demona ?
If the new sea ponies get a song, it HAS to be a new song.
The original song is for the original seaponies
What's so wrong with "Call Upon The Sea Ponies"?
it has to be catchy though
inb4 Pop cover of original
aniderp: Are you doubting Daniel Ingram's ability to write a catchy new song?
i could see them incorperate Shoo bee doo in somehow like to the rythme of the sea ponies song
nah im not
i think he can do it!
Ohhh, Caramel is getting a movie.
Really?!
This is Daniel Ingram we're talking about. If anyone can write a new song worthy for the new seaponies, it's him.
REALLY?!
FREAKING. REALLY?!?!
true
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXC7q_rkwOY&hd=1 <-- The trailor.
no youtube when stream on
I honestly would not want to see the old song recycled for the new generation. That's just lazy.
is that...
A RULE VIOLATION?
That unallowed link
[sniff] I smell trouble.

A RULE VIOLATION!? ALL MODS TO CHAT 1 ALL MODS TO CHAT1!

cachi01|confused: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8G9Go7opQ84/ULhjTNQzQzI/AAAAAAABFUY/guO3GQkT50s/s1600/1.JPG Seaponies in G4 is cannon now.
wait wut
wat
cachi01|confused: Because sega was desperate to make new Sonic-related games for its newest system at the time so people would buy it?
now im double confused .-.
whoever made that pic, just won the internet
dem g3 graphics :S
Gold_Demona: .-.
nope... nothing else od intrest
cachi01|confused: I looked it up at EQD, recently, two new MLP books are going to be released soon, one of them was that picture I shown.
.-.i just lost interest on the comics
cachi01|confused: Sooo...yeeeeaaah...Seaponies are canon now.
are you still going on about that?
I still don't understand how that's a bad thing...
cachi01|confused: The new Seaponies resides in an underwater kingdom called Aquastria, ruled by King Leo of the Cosmic Council, and Princess Celestia's cousin.
Aquastria
wut
Look it up, silly pony.
im not going in my brother room agaon..there might be something in there thats for me D:
cosmic council
wut
aniderp: Why were you in there in the first place? O_o
oh damn, i just realized today is friday
its friday morning!
pony_5196: Eeyup
Pfft, it's Saturday.
lol
suddenly beatles?
Oh Mojay
cachi01|confused: Search on Google and look up "MLP Under The Sparkling Sea", you'll see what I mean.
Not suddenly. They've been on for a long time now. :D
is wrek gonna straem ps2?
pony_5196: Who knows?
Maybe Kingdom Hearts?
meh, i stop following kingdom hearts after the 2nd game
the storyline is too confusing now
^
Me too
The storyline got full of itself is what happened
they should have just came out with the 3rd one already
Organization XIII got too popular
like, how many diffrent side games on diffrent consoles can they make?
Too many
kingdom hearts <3
Look, I KNOW we all wanted Kingdom Hearts 3 to end this confusing storyline schnengian, but all the other games outisde of story aren't so bad...
im surprised they havnt made one exclusive to facebook
i need to get DDD
and also BBS
The only problems is that all of them are on different handhelds!
i havent played those .-.
btw where the fuck do you download coded??? i've been searching for years for a download
the only good side game imo is chain of memories
implying 368/2 days wasnt good
Chain of Memories was good storywise, but I didn't care for the card-battle game play style.
it was alright, there just wasnt much from it you would need to follow the storyline
i hated the battle system :S
bbs is probly the most informitive out of all the current side games
I haven't played any of the other side games. Just Chain of Memories.
http://imgur.com/a/YQX11
btw
dream drop distance is not side game
its like 2.5
if you dont play it you wont get the story of 3
fakin square enix releasing the remixes only in japan :I
Kinda like how Chain of Memories was supposed to be 1.5?
yep
welp its 3:40 am
what should i do
JRP2234|Zzz: drink booze
Go to bread
JRP2234|Zzz: watch hentai?
plant a tree
while watching hentai
welp g2g cya
bye cachi01|confused
BBS > KH1 > CoM > 368/2 Days > KH2 > coded > DDD
And that's the Kingdom Hearts games in chronological order as of now.
hey bronies i just saw
what did you see sugarponi872
the box for my new tv!
Grrr, stupid overheating laptop
I wouldn't spoil the new episode, would I? of course not, besides I might get banned
what a crying shame that would be.
sugarponi872: the less you say, the better it is. Some people like to walk in completely blind
morning again
Hey Blarg :$
Hello, MadSurge
hiyo Blarg
hm
/me waves
Gold_Demona: you gonna make lunch for us today?
/me gives Blarg a muffin
aniderp: I already had lunch. Munchin on an apple now. :D
oh my, a muffin!
cya guys gotta set up my new tc
*tv
later sugarponi872
later
what was for lunch?
aniderp: leftovers of some strange chicken/broth/vegetable concotion I made earlier this week. :D
concoction*
that sounds good
minus the strange
all gone?
Blarg: It's only strange because I don't know what to call it. :P
It's not really a soup or a stew, cuz there's not enough broth to be called that. =/
Gold: I see. o_o
It's just some low sodium broth, an onion, a tomato, some minced garlic, a bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower and some chicken.
hot chicken?
...Define "hot"?
OH HOT BABY.
I just had a package of skinless boneless thighs and cooked it in the concoction. =/
minus most of the fat
chicken with hot sauce on it
Oh no
I didn't add hot sauce to it
I like hot sauce on bbq wings. :>
Which this wasn't
when i go to resaurant i say hot chicken and they know what i mean!
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates - November 30th
i point to the thing also sometimes hehe
I've never heard if referred to as "hot chicken" so that threw me off. It's more specific where I come from. Hot wings.
bufallo chicken or whatever they call it
i call it hot chicken for some reason..
Or buffalo wings
It's still correct saying "chicken" instead of wings. It just threw me off. :P
Cuz not all chicken is spicy.
I can just imagine: Bufallo chicken...but replace the buffalo sauce with ghost chili sauce :)
And chicken itself can be eaten hot or cold.
i like bonless bufaloo chicken strips :>
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Marathons and Streams Today!
i like having cold (bufaloo strip) chicken
its good cold/hot
And I mean temerature, not spiciness. :P
...
i know
6 hours T_T
Until what?
movie
heh
lol i gotta sleep for waiting
I thought the movie was at 7
That's 8 hours from now
7
7 hours
it is about 7 hours
not 6 silly person
7 hours-ish
dammit I have to go to work in 2 hours
bugger
7 hours minus like 3 minutes.
I'd say it's a little closer than "ish" :P
but "ish" rolls off the tongue better :P
can i have pizza rolls for lunch Gold_Demona ?
aniderp: If you have pizza rolls then sure. XD
aniderp: I haven't any
yay!
i have pizza rolls!
I'm trying to lay off the microwave stuff for lunch.
microwave here i comeee!
or there is lasgana downstairs
I'm amazed I've been able to lay off of sodas. All my previous attempts have ended in catastrophic failure.
but i wanna eat in my room so.. pizza rolls it is
i drink mio energy -shot-
Energy drinks are bad for you if you aren't active. =/
my problem right there
idk were rest is..
oh well i should lay off mio
Just get the mio that isn't energy drink
Gold_Demona: D: why lay off sodas?
MadSurge: Not completely, but enough that I'm not drinking sodas all the time. I'm trying to make healthier consumption choices.
For lunch anyway
My previous regular lunches consisted of either ramen or microwave crap
Plus tons of sodas throughout the day

Gold_Demona: Good thing I went back to swimming. Now I can burn off some of the sugar in a proactive way :$
lol
:D
:P
I still drink sodas sometimes, but I don't keep a supply for myself at home anymore.
Gold_Demona: And energy drinks are blech, way too sweet
It feels like drinking bubblegum
guess what
MadSurge: Yeah Energy drinks are an acquired taste. My husband drinks them.
scootaloo butt
But he works a rigorous hard labor job, so he needs the extra energy.
pizza rolls gonna explode! :D
Gold_Demona: well, he needs the extra energy :)
I described the experience of Red Bull akin to drinking pixie stix.
6_9 i think i gonna sleep T_T
Gold_Demona: what is that?
aniderp: Exploding pizza rolls aren't really a good thing :/
but
It's a sugary powder candy.
That comes in a paper tube
Gold_Demona: aaah
pixieeee
stix
i want a giant pixie stix
its plastic the big ones
Hi, Good morning everyone
it's been forever since I had a pixie stick
I've never had a giant pixie stix, sadly
D:
how've you been TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Only the regular small ones in the paper tubes.
I'm sorry, Wrek, that I disconnected like that. I had connection issues, and I got other stuff to do now.
Wrek is here? O.o

i should start laundry
Does anyone have a cure for writer's block? D:
o.O
Gold_Demona: If I had that, I'd be using it, myself ;A;
what is this
Gold_Demona probably not, I just dropped out of PS2 without warning because my connection dropped.
beattles? Oo
WTF
You got a problem with the Beatles, Tobiwan?
Tobiwan: Yes, the Beatles.

Yes, that's it. :D
So does anyone here does not know that Seaponies are canon now?
24/7
Nooooo! Whenever someone says that, if ponies are given they are the kind that make you wish you never asked!
I know
A little fixated, aren't we VenHur? O_o
And the Beatles smoked weed right before metting the queen?
No really, G4 Seaponies are cannon...
I like them XD
You want proof, right?
dat fixation
VenHur: no...
Okay. :P
Maybe I need to put my brain in the microwave so my creative juices quit acting like molasses.
It works with honey...
VenHur yes I want proof, because I didn't know...

go ninjah.
otakon: martial arts isnt a brawl either, its martial arts
Sumica: BUSTAH WOOFAH
Hai guys
twilight_squirtle: it's the specific technique of asskicking is all it is
The strongest Martial arts is called "Roundhouse kick" It's faster than speed of light, meaning it weighs more than the universe can bear. Or atlest that's what Einsten said.
hiya Chrysalis TORCHLIGHT 2 MOFO! DO YOU HAVE IT?
dat music
Sumica: sink as in somewhere the heat can go
otakon no
BronyDarth: that sentence made my brain hurt
Triple Bitch Slapped.
DED
told yah
otakon: yes its only technique, not fighting itself, so brawls arent martial arts, brawls are brawls
FAIL:
Chrysalis: GODDAMMIT you're only on PC now at least get a PC MP game so we can play together sometime
ass kicked
Fighting Is Magic as humans.
twilight_squirtle: bah enough WATCH THE ASSKICKING
otakon I have MANY pc multiplayer games
noooooo chck

Chrysalis: do you... WHY NOT?! it was 10 bucks hell it probably still is
abibas
Buytoast that's chuck norris.
I guess Chuck wasn't using that knee anyway
because i have bills now
its the unstopable object vs the invincible wall
Buytoast: Chuck Norris lost :D
and snapped INTO PLACE
00,10you will someday realise the futility it trying to correct me.
dat moan
then he died,the end.
Otakon, let me help you: Einsten makes a theory about E:MC Which contains about how much Matter and Light and speed weighs, and "The roundhouse kick" is faster than speed of light
Chrysalis: so do I but you can't spare 10 bucks for a great game?
00,10and yeah systems running at 50C across the board

WHERE IS MY 100 BITS + PROFIT!
Sumica: The kitty represnts the rise of the Chick Norris Jokes

Sumica: It was the 70'ies The director was probably just high when he came up with it
s
00,10makes you wonder where all the chucknoris jokes came from seeing as he got curb stomped
^^^^^
NONONONONONONONOOOOOOOOOO
Spider-Man, SPider-Man...
but.. BRUCE LEE
Sumica: he still lasted longer against Bruce than most did
Where's spike?
Fl00t4sh41: Now i see you may be right...
00,10only because he had plot armor
he's a dragon.
Sumica: hi

Aye, Chuck Norris is still alive. He played in The Expendables 2, for example.

Tis song
cause of death?
LOL He knew it was a trick question
00,10not sure if old video or stream stutter
Sumica: Maybe it's both?
00,10iirc it was a heart disorder
Cuz the stream's been stuttering
i thought it was cancer
As I've heard, he just didn't feel so good, went to lie down, and died. Just like that.
Dude... The movie night starts at a Saturday, how is that possible?
00,10ahhh Cerebral edema
BronyDarth time zones
Friday Movie night: In 5 hours, 50 minutes... Which is a Saturday.
Theories go that he was poisened as he went to rest
00,10died of water on the brain
eenope
woah
this is cinda boring :)
brb to the bathroom
and they kissed?
Pegasister: bc it's a biography
I think this is fascinating
And then nothing sexual whatsoever happened.
I find this awsome
its educational
i find the lack of ponies disturbing
YouTube can fix that.
Desktop Ponies can fix it too
Edit Rarity being drawn away by her horn into the film and I'll be happy with it

Evil: Bruce Lee The True Story
Ah
00,10looks like a young Takai
I came here expecting ponies and I get this, my mind is full of f**k.
random turtle
/me hugs twilight_squirtle :)
Better than what's on Sky On
One*
a CANTONESE OPERA SINGER
/me hugs AJIsHaunter :3
00,10good thing we called it Bronystate and not Ponystate
BronyGoldIngot: We don't stream ponies all the time. The FAQ will explain everything.
OJAHAJA
I had to explain to my friend today why MLP isnt for kids
Woah, i didn't know Bruce was born in the US
You should've just said two words.
That's not completely true, though.
I explained how evil some people can be, how CMC tried to kill babs, how the Mane 6 had mental breakdowns
4, and chan.
MLP is for kids. But that doesn't mean it isn't for mature people, either.
good evening/afternoon
Trixie is just mean
Hi, Alchemist. :)
Is MLP even for kids anymore?
Hai Alchemist :)
They did not try to kill Babs
Yes, Evil.
Do they make it with children in mind?
lol Bruce the Dancer
AJIsHaunter: are you the new manifestation of ASisawesome?
Evil: Hasbro, or Studio B?
It is, but it certainly is a lot more fun to watch if you understand the increasing amount of references in it
Ip Man?
Studio B
Alchemist: Yep.
Evil: they made it with people in mind
No shit
AJIsHaunter: why the name change?
'MURICA
Alchemist: Long story. :D
where he got into MORE fist fights
Wasn't his son named Huang?
cångfo
no idea
#gtareference
man he'd STILL be around too if he hadn't suddenly died
Evil: Well, I obviously can't speak for everyone working at Studio B, but from what I know, it's a real pleasure. They get (almost) complete artistic freedom, the way I hear it. So I'd say that it's ars gratia artis; art for art's sake.
I see
i think his son is named brandon
^was
otakon: brilliant deduction :P
was
yeah he died too
his son died also?
No
His son died in an gunshot accident
He became unborn
got killed by a faulty gun
Today I found out Abraham Lincoln has a living relative
thats sad :<
gunshot accident? you mean murder?
no
Anyone heard about the movie "Crow"?
it was a blank from a gun fired in a stunt
otakon: The gun wasn't faulty, it wasn't supposed to be loaded with real bullets
SirGanjalf: with brandon lee?
Alchemist: Yes
SirGanjalf: I love that movie
Fl00t4sh41: it wasn't loaded with real bullets, it was a blank that malfunctioned
BYE EVERYPONY. love ya. >_>
Moving faster than the old man reacts.. Darn
SirGanjalf: brandon was killed druring the filming of that movie
lol he's flinching and Bruce never touched him ONCE
That accident happened while making that movie
Later, Pegasister
bye Pegasister take care
ah
looks good with a beard
Hey it's my dad
See ya later Yvonne! Yvonne see ya later! Okay okay iloveyou
Is that batman
no it's The Green Hornet
SirGanjalf: I think it was the scene where he jumps on top of the table during the crime gang meeting and everyone starts shooting at him
Kato from the Green Hornet
Looks moore like spiderman
but in the Green Hornet the butler/driver did ALL of the work
Is that Los Angeles
IS that Dan Lee
probably
he just said it was
Just out of curiousity, how long is this biography?
soooooooo slooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww
otakon: Thats what butlers are usually paid for
CountDoofus: probably just over an hour
Alchemist: Yeah, it was at the beginning of the movie. (Filmed as last last though)
Is that a gym
Evil: are you gonna keep asking retorhical questions?
Otakon: Do you know what a rhetorical question is?
It's a question not intended for an answer. I'm not asking those questions, so-
HEY ITS DAN LEE AGAIN
...
so you're being caption obvious then?
hey bronies I just finished setting up my new TV and it is AWESOME!
sugarponi872: Yay!
IS Dan Lee related to Bruce Lee
sugarponi872: nice
Evil: no Lee is a common surname is all
Ah
Yeah I know 3 lees lol
like Patel is a common Indian surname
Stan Lee could be related to Bruce and Dan
lol if only
Looks like EQD refused my latest comic... Darn.
Lee is a quite common name, i think
Is that Brandon
CountDoofus: oh well maybe next time?
CountDoofus: Link?
Evil: ARE YOU DEAF!?
He doesn't look very... Brucey
shannon
Evil: he's half asian is why
Hopefully. Next one I have in mind makes me laugh out loud.
I see
is she alive? >.>
Hey it's daniel craig
aniderp: maybe

Mods are alseep! Post ponies!

Scoot-Scootaloo: oh boy imma po--waaaait, whats that @ near your name, are you a spai??

BrucieState
^
Gold_Demona: Well duh>_>, you're on Bruceleestate
but we're pokestate
SirGanjalf: Duh :P
Genetically Superior, Baby!
Bruce Lee is a GOD
we need to have the green hornet series streamed some time
If you ever read about what he could do in detail, you'd be amazed
chocolate rain
green hornet's a series?
:O
/me becomes water
it was back in the old days
oh GOd
Green Hornet was a series in the 1960s
/me drinks valoreins
From the same studio that brought us wham bam pow Batman. :D
oh great more Skrillex. Why do ponyfans like this crap?
what year did he die in?
Deacon: Not just a series, but it was a series with Bruce Lee doing kung fu
pony_7222: EWWW Skrillex :|
GREEEEEGRAAAGRMMRAWWWWRRR tHAT'S WHAT THIS "MUSIC" SOUNDS LIKE
pony_7222: just because you don't like Skrillex, doesn't mean nobody else can.
^
if rap is called music, then dubstep definitely is
pony_7222: Because it's easy for a lone composer to make on his computer?
I don't hear any Skrillex here, do you guys hear any skrillex?
NO BUT IT'S all PONYFANS SEEM TO L;ISTEN TO
What about music with...I dunno, INSTRUMENTS?
I just hear wubs
pony_7222: not at all
pony_7222: Implying everyone likes dubstep
Well I don't see any Skrillex around these parts now! :P
Sounds like TV feedback. Ugh.
Well, whatever this is. It's awful.
pony_7222: Be fair. There's plenty of non-dubstep MLP-inspired music.
pony_7222: i love orchestral music, but i also like some dubstep
Oh yeah, so music like MandoPony and AcousticBrony, not a single brony likes. Legit.
you might want to listen to some Beatlesbrony then , theres something difrent for you
No sir, no skrillex here, and thank you for sharing your opinion! I'm going to put it in this special box, my Opinion Box
That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it. Although, some people may not agree with your opinion.
also, i don't get remixes. theyre never as good as the original song theyre mixed from
ever
i like this song somewhat, although the lyrics are bleh
pony_7222, not eveyone like dubstep, not everyone likes rock/metal/alternative, etc
onions!
I like prety much every genre, except modern pop and rap
I just wish it didn't sound like my speakers were blowing out.
pretty*
I see you're still sharing your opinion! Let me just put it in my "Opinions Box"
pony_7222: yeah i think so too
It just sounds like NOISE...like obnoxious feedback
I like some forms of dubstep, but that doesn't mean that I like ALL dubstep and that it's all I listen to.
I listen to a vast amount of other genres of music as well.
sounds like throat singing gone way wrong
Once again, my Opinion Box is filling up :$
Streaming issues?
/me sets Scoot-Scootaloo's opinion box on fire
Thank you for making it less empty <3
wat timing
where's Gondor when we need more opinion boxes?
Hold on, let me look for a F**k to give....
I think everyone needs an Opinion Box. Someone should get an Opinion box~
....nope, nothing. Don't like it leave
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Mad Mares (Mad World Parody by Ember) / Swinga Da Plot / Pinki! Fun!!
Does anypony else want to share an Opinion Box?
Ah. Mute button. So nice...
Holla
Well, I think Imma head out for the day.

Scoot-Scootaloo: Not sure if want.
See y'all tomorrow, Bronystate
Toodles, Gold_Demona

See you tomorrow Gold_Demona! :)
Sounds like a car battery and an oscilating fan getting it on..
want a muffin before you go?
i'm in class right now:)
bye Gold_Demona
Ouch
Scoot-Scootaloo: Silly scoots, you're not allowed an opinion on the internet, everyone must liekand dislike the sane thing :)
pony_7222: Please, tell me more so I can put it in my box~
same*
See that icon with the loudspeaker on it? Click that and it will make the afwul noises go away.
:D
By the way, Scoot-Scootaloo. I am VERY well aware that I'm not supposed to tell you what to stream or not to stream. Did you go ahead and stream the documentary on Woodstock already?
is this still on?
Yep, otakon.
Not yet, but I will
i just wonder why almost every ponyfan likes this type of music is all. I'm not telling you to change it.
how long is this?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
otakon, it's a loop.
oooooh
that long
god why couldn't we get PINKIE on loop
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!

otakon, it's a water resevoir for my cats to drink out of, and it keeps circulating the water and running it through a filter so the water is always clean. But it's been out of service for months.

It's not even the youth who don't pay attention to issues and make HORRIBLE decisions based on the flavor of the day. Hamas has won a decisive victory in the UN today. They have earned a great deal of prestige by hiding behind their own civilians while shooting rockets at Israeli civilians.

Yes, I LOVED Calvin and Hobbes.
Over here in Belgium, he's called Casper. :[
Kalle och Hobbe
CountDoofus: Did they ever explain why?
Saxy should be here...
Nope. They just did. Maybe because Casper is more commonly known than Calvin, though I've never met anyone named either.
so calvin and hobbes was that good eh?
That was amazing <3

Deacon: You buy the toilet paper brands that are shot in your face?
Fl00t4sh41 hey they do the same thing for t-shirts
Deacon: I have a personal rule of never wearing anything that has been fired at me
I learned that lesson the hard way
That's a pretty good rule
Eh, close enough.
Well, their boners be gone

Halo?
in other news, hope the movie I picked would be ok for people
Gah, chat crashed.
well stream is in 3 hours.......they'll be on by then i think
Yep.
Winter hasn't even started yet and already I can't wait until spring is here.
i've seen this before
SHINJI ARAMAKI!!
10 mins :O
on netfrix
Now what the hell is this?
Someone posted this channel in mane chat?
Looks like Halo.
It IS Halo.
Video game or full-length movie?
Never played it.
CountDoofus: I can. I like Winter. :3
It's a film short.
Apparently this =/= movie
So shooting the entire enemy fleet is an option?
I am playing it now :D
Why are they sending in commandos?
from what I remember, Halo was pretty ok
yea...my fault....forgot about the join command
It's from the anime thing
Ah, I see.
Halo is pretty awesome.
It's no Battlefield, but it's pretty cool.
MACROSS MISSILE MASSACRE!!
You're not the only who's done it, so don't worry about it.
And why are their pilots of choice for space fighters ground soldiers?
Halo is a pretty cool guy
AJIsHaunter: I used to love it too, until I got a job that over 30 miles away, and driving through snow sucks.
CountDoofus: 30 miles? :O
Don't they have actual pilots?
Eh, I'm more of a PlayStation guy... but the visuals here are nice.
Well, 50 kilometers.
I <3 the original PlayStation.
me too <3
FUQ
That plan
Blow up a giant spaceship to kill a few enemy soldiers
Perfect plan
I sent my freind this link cause he loves halo
Who here likes playing the original Medal of Honor over modern agmes?
what's this? Master Chief: The Animated Series?
The original spartans ftw
What's this Halo production's name?
Spartans never die
he told me to Buck off cause its pony halo
i LOLd
yay halo legends
why would you send him a perversion of something he enjoys
Short-sighed much?
ugh. when you paint your face white, it really makes your teeth look yellow.
Buytoast: No, its a documentary on the future of the MURRIKAN Military
wat is this
do you truly dislike your friend that much?
ah
I see
Uncle Sam is smiling upon them
MURRIKAH!
wat is this that we're watching
I hav no idea
RainbowDerpy: Master Chief: The Movie
hmm not very good
how dare you
You should air Odd One Out. It's the best Halo Legends short.
you spit on MURIKA with your dislike
Why do they have gun turrets on a 1 man fighter?
Plus it's directed by the guy who directed Dragon Ball Z.
that Halo 4 movie that just came out?
and that's worse than not paying for the super size
Manually operated gun mounts at that
I just heard Andrew Love.
wait
why is tehre a girl halo
Buytoast: You don't know wanything about Halo, do you?
That hud
Ewww Halo
Buytoast: a better question would be why she's wearing less armor then the men
there's a big ring in sapce with a shit ton of water on it or somthing that floods the world
I'm here for the next MLP episode.
Fl00t4sh41: fanservice, duh
and halo goes there to kill the aliens and stop the water
he does this three times
/me google to figure out which one is Halo
Don't most women wear less armor than men in pretty much every game or show ever?
except the third time has a robot
MLP Episode? On MY Bronystate?
Ponies? What, are you one of those bronies or something?
CountDoofus: I like those rare instances where they wear the same amount of armor :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: plese don't
omgomgomg
but last time i checked, the only girl in halo was the hologramic purple data eater
It's more likely tha you think
MadSurge: http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20070922
Are they Klingons now?
what is this?
So the covenants cheif weapon is blowing up their own ships to kill everything inside?
oh wow, Bum Tickely's Words the Series
theres a halo movie?
Dj-pon3 it was animated iirc
CountDoofus: that doesn't count, in Soulcalibur noone loses limbs :D
Dj-pon3: There's a series of Halo shorts called Halo Legends.
Master Chief?:O
whow
kool
The CG here is fantastic.
woah now, why is Cotrana blonde
Huh, you'd think it'd be easier for him to just carry the entire pod.
and solid
Title Drop
wait, this isn't One Piece
Tovler: LOL.
Silly Grunt.
He arms his opponent before fighting him?
Why?
honor
Honorable duel?
honor
It's an honor thing.
hey spyrofan
13i love how people show up 19 hours early for the episode
They're Klingons.
it's MURIKA'S greatest asset
Cheif has killed thousands without a blade
Oh I'm here most every day.
Shizuka: episode of what? <_< >_>
Fl00t4sh41: It's called "honor".
Shizuka: It seems that SOMEPONIES want to see some Ponies early... Shall I do the honors? >: D
A THOUSAND HELLS AWAIT YOU!!!

Scoot-Scootaloo: inb4 sea- or not-G4 ponies.

cowvarkian: The hijack on Mips means we can't use it anymore for streams.
welp brb, gonna leave for a bit
Bye, thelonecubone. :3
AJIsHaunter: I know that, but mips wasn't a very good streaming service anyways
gonna use my home computer :3
True, but I didn't mind Mips.
mips was hijacked?
I kinda like veemi now, it has support for 16:9
I forgot what we used to use before mips.
Fl00t4sh41: Last Saturday during the new episode
AlienWarhead: I wasn't here at the time
what happened?
an orange with legs
worst that happened
and arms
Fl00t4sh41, http://imgur.com/sKnw1
What I liked about Mips was that you didn't have to manually restart the stream for the player. It would do that by itself most of the tme.
*time
lol
Fl00t4sh41: We were hacked twice for a few minutes
Remember, 11/24/12
Sorry I missed it
AdamThePsyduck: I don't think I will
eh, 1/1/12 was more trajic
I wasn't there at the time ;~;
Deacon, what happened then?
so many bots, just....so many bots.....
haha
Deacon, I see.
NNNNNOOOOOOOO
Deacon: Bots?
That works too
KHHHHAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN
*Looks around carefully* F-F-Free.... hats..... here....
JASSSSOOOONNNN
yea, someone let loose some bots in the chat, and cause the chatroom to be spammed with multiple post
*Gets swamped by TF2 players* 'Blerg'
Deacon: Was it anything offensive?
Now I'm listening to Roundabout. :)
AJIsHaunter nah it repeated whoever talked last, and did that for 10 times
/me wishes he didnt have to kill the forsworn in skyrim... and the necromancers...
in a row
FIGHT
because blood works like that, right
Holy crap thats alot of blood.
He's so a samurai.
AJIsHounter: Lol
/me wishes saving the forsworn leader was meaning
ikr
How did he not notice the sword lodged in his chest=
meaningful:P
AJIsHaunter: Dover Boys, duh.
I don't want to kill the necromancers...
Who else here loves Halo music?
Alright, just making sure. :D
because I like necromancers

Scoot-Scootaloo: please, no pony
Halo Wars was RTS.
Deacon: RTS was RECON
Deacon: nevermind
Fl00t4sh41: *Gasp* GET OUT

Pinkies_imagination: Trust me, you don't want THIS kind of pony

Fl00t4sh41: pfft.... couldn't be anything bad... right? ......right....?
I want years of drawing practice in a minute :<
Spoiler mission fails
Pinkies_imagination: I'll go get the brain bleach

Yep yep <3
Scoot did you see my requst?
Scoot-Scootaloo: We were all newfoals once. :3

AJIsHaunter: I was smart enough to shut up and listen to everyone else
No, I'm not taking requests today, I'm going to stream my favorite MLP episode~
Y U so blech?
and read the rules/faq
alright
Deacon: the one with kefka?
AJIsHaunter: Sure, but most of us grew out of it

That's true. I know I was one once. :D
Tentaclebeast the actual third one

OH OH OH! Scoot-Scootaloo: You Really should play one of the, Two best sisters play, Videos! That would be like.... so totally awesome!
Pinkies_imagination: YEAHHHHHH no.
More samurai elites?
I like the Two Best Sisters idea.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Aw... why not :(
Let's watch whatever Scoot-Scootaloo feels like streaming.
Two best sisters is great idea
Pinkies_imagination, because Scoot-Scootaloo streams whatever the fuck he wants. :P
Because I'm not taking request today :P

Fatality.
Scoot-Scootaloo: what about mild suggestions
MLG?
Poor grunt ;~;
Sup'
Scoot-Scootaloo: MMk... how about next time then? that okay?
Scoot-Scootaloo: As a maybe
of course <3
I think Halo is a pretty cool guy, eh fights monsters and doesn't afraid of anything
grrav hamor
Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
Wasn't this supposed to be a stealth missiob?
Dude fail, Halo is not a Character.

I have this on DVD; quite good
I CALL BULLSHIT
What's Samus doing here?
Scoot-Scootaloo: :O
I prefer Red vs Blue animated
How could this happen?
The fastest spartan alive was a girl... think it was S-173
Scoot-Scootaloo: where can I go to put in suggestions for next weeks videos?
Or could've been @-73
*S-73
Cue awesome fucking music
I have no idea what anyone in this chatbox is talking about. I'm mucking about on some forums.
Oh no, we do requests live! I'm just not taking any today
I smell a samus ripoff
Pinkie_imagination the lottery tommorrow
Scoot-Scootaloo: mmk
So... ponies

There are plenty of women in the Marines, ODST, and Spartans.
Wat

and ya know, real life military
Let's watch some motherbucking ponies!
Oh, wait
I agree with Scoot-Scootaloo
Ooooh
BaconMane's color script kick is being angsty today :\
That's colors >.<
YAH
This is actually a pretty realistic depiction of a female spartan, what with all the genetic engineering and whatnot.
hey which do u think was more disturbing not better
So Halo trie to do a Metriod sand have the shick twist the badass was a chick the whole time.... pathetic.
When your facing extinction the military won't discriminate.
Scoot-Scootaloo: It's okay, we don't need to watch ponies. :3
Scoot-Scootaloo: Make sure its the "good" one ;)
Brace yourselves people. Shitstorm incomming
Cupcakes or Rainbow Factory?
Spartans aren't the kind of soldiers who take off their suits for some RnR.
Scoot-Scootaloo . . . I read that wrong . . . so very wrong . . .
It looks like people DO want ponies :3
someone mentioned skyrim.. now I really want to play it... DAMN YOU BRONIES! YOU CONFOUND ME TO FIGHT DRAGONS! (Thinks of spike) Oh my...
Scoot-Scootaloo: No, we don't. :3

/me eats my donuts
NOPE! *springs away*
GOD DAMMIT WINGED

Each of these were done by a different animation studio, and lumped together. Each is its own story, but within the Hal universe, Lunac.
Spartans are OP
Agreed. :D

/me runs fast

*Uses iner pinkie to magicly walk away with dash's donuts*
OH FUCK
Damnit.
*runs away
pony_216917 : not sure. I think that's like, amongst the first few episode
KTKomedy2813 the two most important rules of BronyState: NEVER COMPLAIN ABOUT THE STREAM and NEVER REQUEST PONIES. Both will get us G3.6, which no one likes.
MadSurge: She'll grow up to be a great carpenter one day. :3
*except the knife was a twinkie*
Hello everypony ^^

Canadian_Brony: so, what about never RP

Wolf if u help me ill split the donuts 50-50 deal
Chasing Pinkie's imagination is like trying to talk without a throat or a diaphram X_X
with what..
*Gets tackled* What are you doing? *Dash see's she tackled a cardboard cutout of me* Haha.... *Walks away again*
You forgot to mention "NEVER CONSTANTLY SAY GAK".
cowvarkian that's less important because we're allowed some wiggleroom on that.
Am I the only one here actually watching the episode and NOT going crazy in the comments?
Pinkie's imagination stole my donuts!

HALO!
I got top comment on Nirvana's Breed
Jesus?
sonic + rainbowdash=wow that shit is fast
I commented "Holy crap, I have top comment"
Of Nazerath?
mishia Jajpan I guess itis another crappy anime
NO ITS ME
That comment ended up being the top comment
This a fan animation or offical?
Er...
Okay?
Lunac: I was more talking about humans, but yeah banning cannibalism in equestria would be good
And I commented "I have top comment, again?!"
Kids and women do everything in anime
And I have 6 likes
:P
NOW WHERE'D I PUT THE MACHINE
Some of it is canon
Sup guys
...
>:d
J_E_Smith71 Official made and payed by bungie to the studios to make these
I sold the machine
c:
Lunac: "must be 14 to join chat". Isnt that the offical internet "adult" age?
No wait, its 15
nvm
sp phoenix
Twas worth alot of bits
and "11" counts as a really young kid. Oh internet *sigh*
This halo legends?
mishia every kid os able to do the maths needed to select he right year to view st=hit they shouldn;t online so precautio is okay
*grabs nearest pony and attaches him to chains and sends him into the machine
*SPectra comes out*
RainbowDerpy you forgot the crystals... ;)
sup peeps
THERE ARE NO CRYSTALS IN TEH RAINBOW FACTORY!
so, is it just in our galaxy, or the entire universe?
That looked faintly unpleasant.
Tenecales creatures...in an anime I give this 3 minutes before some school girl gets raped
RainbowDerpy: Correct.
Lunac: .......k. Also; That was weird
And not the thing I want to tab to instantly. Ew. :P
cowvarkian Alot of the universe yes but all of it more or less
mishia anime is
*grabs Lunac*
/me seems nervous about tomorrow's episode.
Oh well.
?
*puts him in chains*
killerpony7733: that seems a bit unrealistic
String_Shredder: that's disgusting
RainbowDerpy: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH SPEEEEEEEECTRA
*drops him in the machine*
killerpony7733: seeing as the covenant are only in our galaxy
Excue me mishia I'm a casual brony so I can;t be cuaght
DAMMIT
killerpony7733: and we never leave our galaxy
**Rainbow Derpy
Excuse.....can not...... caught
whose played halo 4 already?
killerpony7733: and there is no mention of anything outside our galaxy
Why can the flood only eat sentient beings and not all those other organic beings?
You need a little practice Lunac
But hey, I like you.
no not Halo it;s called a RING WORLD READ CLASSIC SCIFI YOU HACK ANIME WRITERS
*grabs mishia and throws him in*
hello
Doesn't really matter what's outside our galaxy.
NOT A SINGLE SOUL GETS THROUGH!
cowvarkian Explain why the lore explains how the forerunners did more then that and seeded several galaxies beyond the milky wauy?
I came from Heaven.
way*
Someone always dies in the end
God gave me a letter and said GTFO
The letter said GTFO
NO WHOS GUNNA HELP ME MAKE RAINBOWS?!
killerpony7733: it says galaxy
Friday Movie Night in 1 hour from now! ERMERGERD
not galaxies
/me Hoofs RainbowDerpy Crayons
unless you have another source
Foreunners alike all precursor ancient races seeded everyhwere after a vast devestation then either died or fucked off.
*NOW
there you go.
RainbowDerpy: Your argument is invalid. I am a She
HEY LOO!
Spectra is a She
huhh
o-o
cowvarkian Idunno makes sense if they did. They have the tech to do it tbh
*grabs Nightlock and beats shit out of him*
da fuq?

Ooooow
killerpony7733: ok, whatever

Earth FTW!
*rips off mishia's arms
cowvarkian However doesn't matter i like the more ancient lore to it many don't know about the prehumans and precursors
RainbowDerpy: Problem? I'm a she, so you through in a copy
THe story line of Hay lawl makes me laugh.
*throws her in*
then everything changed when the fire nation attacked
Halo has a story?
RainbowDerpy: Nope, I dont have arms
Yes
of course
BEST SONG EVA
Im dead c:
Lunac: everything does
RainbowDerpy: Ponies dont have arms

Lunac Beyond the games yeah quite a ton
i thought there was only one!
*rips off her legs and throws her in*
Lunac: its called Lores
this song was the ending of halo 4 o.O
*Machine jams*
every game has a Lore
pretty much
OooooooooWwwww...
nope
/me doesn't even play the multiplayer anymore
Non game content is noncanon to me, as like in Star Trek
machine never jams
RainbowDerpy: I am not even a pegasus, dumbutt. I am a Earthpony. And you don't have fucking god powers, so your argument is invalid
all we know is war....
Can someon get me oooooooooout
THIS IS SPARTAAA
Spectra is in all ponies
RainbowDerpy: Find another way to kill me/get spectra
damn it pony_6965 you beat me to it
Sup guyz
We just use pegasii to get rid of the weak
the pieces of eden?
NUCLEAR BOMB!!
A v2 seriously?
RainbowDerpy: It is pegsus specific. Go read rainbow factory, or start comenting on the video. This isn't a roleplay site for rainbow factory
M'urica

yeah the music is good.
FOR THE GALAXY!
So, why don't they just nuke infected planets from orbit instead of sending infectable soldiers down to shoot at the flood?
No Tucke;rs hybrid son brought about peace you worthless anime
As was earlier said. The only thing that can unite Humanity is a common enemy. Perhaps thats true for all life.
ayejay is right, shaggy :3
good so no pony over loads
i like it
Hi guys! First time in a few weeks! Finally got settled into new house. Hows your day going?
Planet could still have life on there that isn't infected, Fl00t4sh41

AJIsHaunter: :D
Sentient life for that matter
Good, grayhoof? How about you? :)
S'all good, grayhoof!
DashWithRainbows: How long will it remain uninfected?

I mean, As a earthpony, I lay on hay like a normal pony...not like lyra >_>

Hi grayhoof, just playing Borderlands 2 :3
Anyone else thinking Eldritch Abominations?
DashWithRainbows: and now will bullets remove the infection?
Pegasi are best pony

All pony races are best pony. :3
^
AJisHaunter its all going good glad to hear that
Fl00t4sh41 Kill the infected form = kills the body.
Who has read the Piano Man
Although
Why does everything I touch explode? =(
Dat forerunner helmet

Scoot-Scootaloo thats always good ^.^
Another infected form can take over the body if it is still able to be used in combat
Im already praying for your souls because of today's B movie
no flood is best pony race
*Sees a single infection form* Burn the whole fucking planet.
DashWithRainbows: But the flood infects like a virus, its not just the big ones you need to worry about
Bull. Secrets exist to be known.
I have an untouchable secret.
=D
Infected forms are the small ones.

Color effects are nice.
The VA's might be Canadian but MLP hardly ever airs in Canada...

Pat!!
Kandarihu: Fun fact, his proposed increase on upper-class tax rates are nowhere near as high as the tax rate during the Reagan years.
:P
Kandarihu: That's kind of the basis of a progressive tax code, as it's been in existence since the income tax was introduced.
hai Thunderlane343
MATT

In my opinion Matt and Pat =/= Egoraptor and JonTron

You can't compare them

Kandarihu: Then he cut it to about 45%
oh its a pumbloom

Kurra: CAPTAIN SPARKLES DAMN YOU
so first app install on my new phone is the mlp game..
cowvarkian, the fairest tax code is a flat tax. That way, everyone pays the same proportion of their taxes and nobody gets punished for making more money.
Cause baby toniight, the creepers trying to steal all our stuff agaain~
eyes
Kandarihu: Please show me some evidence of mass nationalization of industries, seizure of private property for the state, and a centrally planned economy.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
FlutterSAUR: what??
:I
And run run until it's done done, until the sun comes up in the morn
.........
AssaultWithEmbraces: no
AssaultWithEmbraces: O.o
Kandarihu: so, paying more taxes so the federal government can actually support itself, if punishment?
Shame the sun doesnt hurt creepers
Cuz baby to niiiiiiiiiiiiight
UGH
9_6 My bad

Kandarihu: No, flat tax punishes the poor way more than the wealthy.
Vordox, cachi01|ProjDIVA: Whaaa? I can't sing in chat?
Thunderlane343, oh that's nice, it's a shame that it's against the rules to post videos during stream :3
Thatsss a very nice everything you have there.
tsssssssssssssssssss
I can say that I sort of genuinely kind of enjoy this song
AssaultWithEmbraces: I'm suprised you know the lyrics
shout out to captiansparkles
Kandarihu: They have far less disposible income.
only song i like from captain sparkles is fallen kingdom
I like "Screw the Nether" better
shout out to all those who play minecraft

Vordox of course. I got it on my phone <3 My niece knows the chorus though

Record_Discord: nope parodies of bad songs are also bad songs
sparta kick
i love the second one they did it was awesome
cachi01|ProjDIVA: Don't knock it until you try it
Kandarihu: In any case, claiming that Obama is "a Marxist" for wanting to reset tax rates to 90's levels for 2% of the population.
Record_Discord: its still the same shitty song with different lyrics
cachi01|ProjDIVA: so, would that make nearly every wierd al song also bad?
unless its weird al
cachi01|ProjDIVA yea.
DocSane, Benjamin Franklin once said that the best thing to handle poverty is to make the poor uncomfortable in their poverty. A flat tax is much fairer than a system that steals most of the wealth from the people who's efforts and leadership in the private sector have built the foundations of society, and give it to the people who do nothing to earn it.
Deacon: What about screw the nether T~T
Cool Story, Bro
Kandarihu: Sorry. Premature return. In any case, it's absurd.
gaben
Record_Discord meh
dat text
hey, no arguing
why are we talking about politics?
Deacon: D:
its annoying
waffleness: cause we are politicstate
i would know
lol
I don't really like modern pop music as much as the next person
waffleness: because we are
Kandarihu: False premise: that the poor are lazy who do nothing to earn a living.
How was I supossed to know we were both related? Believe me if I knew she was my cousin we never would have dated :P
That's nice and all Kandarihu, but uncle Sam said "Let there be light and freedom."
Because politics are one of the fundamental pillars of our society and ignoring them would be bad for humanity in general?
:D
oh boy
huh?
here we go
yes
DocSane: because apparently having like, 4 jobs means you're lazy
Wut
xD
welp...i just bought the humble indie bundle....

oh god its rated F!!
just yes
Friendship is Gic?
Pones <3
Ah yes, because if they're poor, naturally they're poor because they just don't WANT it enough.
YAY :D
ANOTHER POOP
XD
>_>
Kandarihu: The poor are often stuck in low-apying jobs and work far more hours than the wealthy.
RAWR! :O
W00t
Like saying that getting out of poverty is wasy.
waffleness, because during the Metal Wolf Chaos video, someone talked about Obama as a hero.
Deacon: Well, fair fair, neither do I, but that's because of people unable to come up with good lyrics OR good notes.
PAPER MARIO FTW

DocSane, the only truly toxic element in an economy is the government, and even though it hardly started with Obama, he's made it worse since he took office.
