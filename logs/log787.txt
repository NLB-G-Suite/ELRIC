WHO IS THE PRZIDENT THEER
05same guys that animated this
Wrek: Rhino Episode, Giant 3D Episode, Mount Tibet Episode? :P
05they animated the original X-men too right?
Wrek: He has extensive credits in animation and children's entertainment, having been the story editor/showrunner on iconic TV series like ThunderCats; SilverHawks; Peter Pan and the Pirates and The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest.
I think the Medusa episode was first.
Peter Lawrence (author)
WE SHOULD WATCH THE POWERPUFF GIRLS...ya...... i said that....im epic
Freaked me out when i was a kid
OMG OMG THE TWIN TOWERS
WAS THIS BANEND?
05Vordox: meant the animation studio/style
.....SIRSCLY
I think so, Wrek.
Wrek: Onlysay Hanna-Barbera
05anyways
... PWERPUFF GIRLS
pleese
the studio produced many successful animated shows, including The Huckleberry Hound Show, The Quick Draw McGraw Show, The Flintstones, The Yogi Bear Show, Top Cat, The Jetsons, The Magilla Gorilla Show, Jonny Quest, Space Ghost, Wacky Races, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! and The Smurfs among others
remember, games will rule the world
and suddenly aliens
loool
This is just Nostalgia right here
seems legit
...OMG I WAS RIGHT......THEY ARE GANNA BOMB THE TWIN TOWERS...i knew i!
lol
Oh snap
in 1994, and in October 1996, Turner merged with Time Warner. By the time of the merger, Turner had turned Hanna-Barbera towards primarily producing new material for Cartoon Network, including the successful Cartoon Cartoons shows such as Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken, I Am Weasel and The Powerpuff Girls.

also youre wrong
doctors do know why we need sleep
My textbooks are old, so I probably am wrong
there is some thing that is released in your brain and you need to sleep to get rid of it
twilight_squirtle: so that we dont die a death of deatheness
geek no the ponies people have, like phase pony
at least thats what i think i rememebr from high school
13why do you need to sleep?
texasboykc09: wut
13because your body is WEAK
13and PITIFUL

sleep is for the weak
because humans are wimpy wimpy WWWIMPY

twilight_squirtle: Melatonin? Because that just causes sleepyness, doesn't explain why we need to sleep

jcelios: well we need to sleep to get rid of it iirc
Shizuka: when did you play protal
DeathStar: DEATHSTARRRRRRRRRRRR

geeky: I real҉ly cannot get enough of him. He has talent, and to use it on ponies, that makes it LOTS MORE EPIC.
I miss the 40's...
I miss the 2030s. :'(
I miss the 1800s

texasboykc09: yah

I miss the time when g-- used to rule The Hub
No
No no no
Nah, ponies rule The Hub, and always have.
Better :P
--- was just a servent to the ponies, and grabbed all the attention during the episodes.
I think Hub overall is good
geeky: when i'm and it raining i do this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK_u7bfCP08
Not just ponies
666 the number for you and me
Hub has some decent shows, except ponies. Ponies isn't decent at all, it is awesome
It got more attention than Spike
texasboykc09: well then
I might watch My Littlest Pet Shop
geeky: more relaxing
I'll give L͆P͆S͆ a try. Is it any good?
*LPS
/me goes to his room to cry because he misses the past and his father
texasboykc09: yup
IS LPS GOOD!?
I'm not sure
/me throws cookies everywhere
Same voice actor for Rainbow Dash
I refuse to watch it because I might enjoy it. I cannot be distracted from my ponies
It honestly looks crappy to me, but I once thought the same about MLP. That encourages me even more to try out LPS
Kipkat07_USAF: I know that feel
You know what
wat?
I'm gonna go watch it now
SAME HERE!!!, ͆[Alpha]

hi :)
hello
If you want heartwarming here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhcgXke490
interesting stream...
Not on Youtube. :'(
00,02still doing science
Thanks, Java
I heard that Hasbro wanted another fandom for LPS but also commented that the show isn't going to make as much of an appeal to older audiences
no prob
Need to spread Nichijou.
people pay for watching this....I should sell videos with drying paint...
Phase4: i much science you have to do
how
00,02all of it
I watched a couple of LPS episodes, the first two. I don't really like it as much as MLP. It's too tame to my taste
...Is this intentional?
...
My teacher doesn't count at all, he says, "PUT YOUR PENS DOWN." :'(
00,02science is code for "my software is broken and i'm not sure why"
But it's made by the same studio that makes MLP:FiM.
no clock in the room
Phase4: hit it with a hammer
But MLP is actually funny
Found it on YouTube
DaringDerpy: there you go

phas4 how was deus ex: Human Revolution
Brb
phase4
Damned zombies. They are getting into everything
You realise last time you were banned for spamming that type of crap KrazyNoobs?
00,02screw physics, i have a 6 way coupler
Now thats a proper start for a rocket
I was banned for spamming with symbols, Jmo. Does this count as symbols, underlining?
Yes..
00,02hmmm
00,02i wonder
Jmo, darn... I liked underlining my text. Okay, i'll stop now
Just type normally for gods sake.
Phase4: do u like me
00,02wipergone2, i dont dislike you
Looking for inspiration, eh?
Jmo Fine, I'll listen to you. If it really harms other me҉mbers that much with a few symbols, I'll stop if it offends you. Sorry.
00,02hmmmm
http://derpy.me/zHLcF
I really don't see what's wrong with just typing normal.
Phase4: THUNDERBIRDS GO!
It doesn't annoy me, it's just stupid.
SuperBrony64 :D
You'll eventually get told to stop doing it by a mod anyways.
Jmo I don't like using symbols anymore, but typing normal means text that people could actually read. The underlined text is readable, am I right?
11,02HavokOC :D
Nope.
Normal means just like this.
No special bullshit.
11,02KrazyNoobs: Not sure how long ago it was since you made the underscore spam since I was disconnected, but don't do that o-o
00,02hmmmm
Phase4: how big can you build the rocket
00,02i actually have no idea what i'm doing
00,02texasboykc09, as big as you want
Okay SuperBrony64, I have stopped and will stop. Normal type from now on. sorry, i'll leave just to show respect.
They have stability issues when they grow big enough though
but that just keeps launches "interesting"
You don't need to leave.
Leave symbols, I meant. Sorry
Fl00t4sh41: and alot of lag i can guess too
texasboykc09: Depends on the machine its played on.
So Celestia radio.... do they have the Android apps for this?
Fl00t4sh41: mine is weak, i can play trainz12 and it will lag when i put the first train on the track
ah
00,02this is quite dificult
Phase building ULTRA ROCKET
00,02oh wait
Friends?
Say Phase4, if you're looking for a challenge, how about making a rocket with nothing but solid fuel boosters that has to be able to break atmosphere?
I wanna play minecraft pure survival with someone T.T
00,02Fl00t4sh41, i made one in 0.16 that could make orbit
00,02and deorbit
00,02another that could actually hit the sun
I've seen youtube vids of that being done
00,02this will not take off
00,02ok

00,02y u no 64 bit windows build
lol
+Phase4 what are you doing right now
00,0264bit does make a difference
00,02theres like 16 extra registers
can we see you draw!?
00,02HUGE difference
00,02moonslicer, i can't draw
Oh
00,02i can edit images though
i can
Phase4: 32 bit vs 64 bit
i can only draw 2D though
00,02wipergone2, 64bit > 32bit
Phase4: why
and i can only draw dragons and wolves
00,02for many reasons
Phase4: i got 64bit
The only thing i can draw is ponies XD
00,02wipergone2, larger virtual address space, extra registers, a few more efficent instructions
i should make pony sprays for tf2
00,02this is for x86 vs x86_64, different architectures scale differently
im gonna mute the sound and play caramelldansen
I can make animated sprays. But they're annoying because if they're above a certain file size they won't display in game.
00,02a lot of things do run faster with 64bit
wht happens if u run 64bit on a 32 bit oa
os*
00,02doesnt work
00,02well theres no reason it CANT work
Phase4: i got 8gigs
00,02mac osx did that for a while

00,02i forget how to fix this
00,02its converting the gifs thats troublesom

im a complete noob at making sprays
There's probably a How-To somewhere.
This is also a pretty neat lure spray

00,02then vtf
im on a random song spree and i ran across a MLP version of INsAnItY ugh
Phase4: wht is tht
Phase4: Animated sprays have to be below 512kb.
They won't show up in game if they're not.
my brother loves the song so much he says it suits him in so many ways...
00,02XAX, i know
Good.

Germanbrony yeah there were some documents from them about planning on a 4th season.

Phase4: alot better

nothing is officially confirmed though
Though I imagine if I were 100 I'd probably be decrepit and incapable of correcting you if I wanted to.
00,02eh
11,02XAX: Yay :3
Meanwhile: Seriously? You sounded much older, as I recall from MvM when that was a thing.
00,02this is getting a bit boring
yea that would make me laugh if you tryed to spell laugh but you spelt lugfds
'You sounded much older' Lel.
XAX: When I was 15 people on the internet used to mistake me for a bitter 40 year old man.
XAX, pfft everyone sounds either really old or really young on the internet >.<
tried*
im 13
And that explains everything.
/me Is wondering why people even care about age while being on the internet
XAX, Nittany thought I was like 25-30 and British :D
Meanwhile: Pretty sure you thought I sounded like an old Australian man that sits in a bar after a hard day of wrestling crocodiles. Or something.
HEH
Because that's what you do.
bedenough
No, you never label a kiwi as that.
Ever.
^
who has got a WII U??\

I'm unsure what "bedenough" is supposed to be tbh.

Phase4: now what has cause that to happen
If I'm afraid of anything, it's definitely not 13 year olds on the internet.

Don't bullshit people XAX

Vivix: Aww. But... alright.
00,02Meanwhile, some people get agressive over simple things, its best to just drop it

IRC newbie alert.
Elitism is the death of all communities

what its more diffrent then you think meanwhile
Socks: hello

00,02tf2 y u no load
i dont care just let me speak
Phase4: i got tht too
Phase4: Spelling and grammar is totally important on the Internet.
Phase4: cancal then try again
It is, but correcting it is not
they bully because i draw
oh
TF2 always takes ages to load for me.
Well, you get some respite now, I have degu to clean. Tata.
phase4 can i friend you on steam
00,02wipergone2, its just slow
they bully because they think im weird
grammar error Meanwhile
Phase4: can i join?
00,02texasboykc09, i have far too many steam friends right now
moonslicer ill be your friend
:)
they bully because i dont have alot of friends
they bully because i spend more time on a laptop!
I was never really bullied
What server you planning to go on?
but I was "that kid"
00,02i was bullied for a bit, but walk away and they tend to get bored
I spend all my time on a computer, no one bugs me about it.
(because no one talks to me. ;_;)
Cause you're a kiwi.
most bullies get bored if you don't react
Often the reason for bullying is something else than what we think it is
they bully because im the quiet one that never really talk
Never outright bullied but decisively ignored which could probably be worse.
00,02oh god
00,022fort
00,02why does everyone like this map soo much
3edgy5me
It reminds us of the past!
Phase4: Use the AWPer hand jelsngpcjapfndls
i ignore them but it keeps going on and on and on i never react but they just keep bullying!
00,02XAX, ^ that should totaly be an item
Phase4: Because reasons!
00,02and it should be a hat
Phase4: But it is.
Just hang in there, everything ends eventually
00,02the jelsngpcjapfndls
Oh.
00,02ya, ya
babs seed
It should be an unusual effect.
00,02someone called ya just joined

Random letters circle your hat.

If you want
the onlything that make me react is when i draw the best wolf i did then they grab it and rip it it chokes me up
/me stabs ya
mmmm... good hug :)
Phase4: i cant join
,,, they did what moonslicer
I had purple nailpolish and long hair in school
I guess my school had crappy bullies, cause noone really bothered me

/me is metrosexual
WHAT OTHER LIES HAVE YOU KEPT FROM ME
I had long hair but no one bullied me about it.
;__;
I'm caspianbordersexual.

/me pats Jmo
00,02more people need to be more passive
play benny hills theme!
00,02everyone gets angry and blames the other person for being angry
whats that?
Mm, I try. I get angry too often in my own opinion
just type it down on youtube
00,02people care far too much about little things :(
okay
Often over things I sohuld not care about, don't want to care about. but life is a constant process of bettering yourself
00,02distracts them from the fun
totally
wat do you want veeveex.
00,02yay~
You have more lies to tell me? ;__;
I want to pet your head
00,02a spot opened
Mmm~~
Hello!
I am an orange
THat's a good lie
00,02moonslicer, dont worry so much about someone correcting your spelling
moonslicer: u ok
ok
?
yes im ok
I hate you Veeveex ;__;
moonslicer: screw the bullys
benny hills theme is playing on my comp
The world of people thinking that incorrect spelling=stupid is passing thank goodness.

what are you playing!?
Well, at least in a lot of areas.
00,02moonslicer, tf2
oh i cant play it
can you play it online with no download?
moonslicer: No, But it's free
I think the game is 10gb now?
oh i cant download it
DONT SHOOT THA PONY!!
"Spraypaint the vegetables"
00,02one player becomes the pony, others have to fight
00,02its saxton hale but with pony
9003
00,02ponies usualy win
when did ponys run around on two fe i mean hooves
It's just simpler in that game to do it that way
00,02well
00,02that sucks
00,02moonslicer, it'd be too hard to modify the animations
rip
oh no mum come night everypony oh and moonslicer dont let the bullies get you down okay :)
00,02if not imposible
you got killed by a evil pony lol
00,02well map change after this round
altering the ponies to be quadropeds would change the hitboxes, and I don't think workshop would allow that- but a freestanding server probably would
00,02Vivix, can servers send custom hitboxes?
what game is this
and suddenly rainbowdash flys in and saves the day lol
00,02the ones on my client dont match the server
00,02ooo, changling time
It can't send, but if you have a client mod that matches a server mod you can get a playable custom
this day aria remix :3
thanks i turned on the volume
00,02i'm not a good spy
00,02Vivix, damn :(
00,02cause i have more than 100ms ping

/me is suddenly curious about hitboxes
00,02thats what you get for standing still with changlings around
you stole my club penguin name lol
Hehe
Just realised I had the stream paused :D
00,02Vivix, its a really big problem with custom characters, any close combat results in the server shunting me around
lol
im gonna go guys, cya later
00,02later SkunkTauri
SkunkTauri: bye
bye
Oh yeah, yeah~ that's the curse of ping- even with how much source games tend to smooth it

* benny hills theme song plays *
Ohai

WTF LOL
00,02moonslicer, yeah, sometimes we get hale instead of pony
turned the music off phase4
00,02everyone prefers pony
Wait

00,02texasboykc09, nah, it was coming from the game, depends on the character

Phase4: what are you thinking of doing now
00,02texasboykc09, research
00,02while i wait
Wha! Derpy Derpy Wha!
00,02i've made a php plugin that gives php applications a fastcgi api
when we're killed it takes sooo long till the next round starts...
00,02i've hacked wordpress to use this, it litterally doubles its performance
00,02for various reasons
Thunderbirds!
Phase4: Too effective.
00,02i'm looking at porting wiki to it
nerfit
00,02Vordox, XD
I <3 all the Thunderbirds
Phase4: Whaaaat? If it DOUBLES the performance... WHY not do it?
I've become obsessed with 0 plugin methods
00,02i always liked thunderbird 2
00,02Vordox, well right now it really is a hack
00,02for example you cant log in
wow... we could actually win this round
00,02and many plugins break
00,02as well as the templates
Phase4: But I mean, why doesn't the company do it? :P
not because of Phase4 and me tho...
Socks: Not gonna lie, I still have thunderbirds bedsheets when ever mine are in the wash :P
Phase4: My fave was always no. 1 becasue I'm boring and uninteresting.
00,02Vordox, because they are stupid
00,02seriously, no one who works with php seems to have any idea what they're doing
Phase4: How crude.
MLP_Brovakiin: That is so cool! I want thunderbirds bedsheets!
php is kind of--crass
XD

08,01dear princess celestica, today i learned that the UK has a Hypnotism Act (1952) which states, among other things, that the process of hypnotism cannot be broadcast in full on television, in case the audience are hypnotised and can't be brought out: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/46
And then nuclear bomb goes off.
Actually, the Go-Soccer match, taken in context with certain aspects of Japanese mystical philosophy, most particularly Omniyaku, makes perfec-- no, wait, it doesn't. That was all rubbish.
The clay is talking?
Kencolt understands it :D
GilDash: read british legislation, obviously
I still don't know whether I can be hypnotised or not.

Wrek: I hate thta feeling.
05salty chocolate balls?
Wrek: You alright,you sexy SOB?
MadSurge: Haven't played that one, but this game if anything seems interesting.

Wrek: Yep
This'll be interesting.
AJIsHaunter: Don't hate me, that was from Space Jam, you know....

just...oh my
Ustream?
08,01which are pretty much the best thing
._.
Hey otakon!
.....
getting your opponent's rocks off seems to be the best strategy
/me South Park reference ftw
-_-
Dark Truffle bawls with Sea salt..?
youa can't Sumica stop asking
08,01AttackWithHugs: that's what they're called! they're swedish
05negerbollar
final form is katamari ball , where everything youdestroy sticks to you and adds to your destructive power
south park rocks.
7I have been here for more than three hours and the chat logs are just people joining and leaving.

NOES
05the best racist piece of baking you can find
Now we know what Tom <--- does besides posting the date of the next episode
adadadadadad
7This place is not the hive of friendship and conversation it once was.
Letting your rock-hard balls smash into your opponent's barriers.
7I am disappoint, guys.
Wrek: What about crackers?
definitely not a euphamism there
/me 08,01omnoms Wrek
sorry

ooo wheres the euphanism
05i prefer solbullar
Their screams of pure horror are funny
05imagine a doughnut, but isntead of a hole in the middle its jsut a pit
08,01solbullar are great
05filled with the yellow stuff from a danish
Wrek: wat.
Wrek: cheese?
Wet, rock-hard balls. Penetrating the opponent's defenses. What's to miss?

this entire game is an innuendo
wrek, go to bed, you're drunk
I don't know
05no really

AttacksWithHugs :V
08,01Wrek: i'm sure there's a urophilia joke in there somewhere

Very carefully
Kipkat07_USAF: why don't you eat them like normal people?

cowvarkian: because Im not normal
And with a great deal of tongue
do you just stick your entire face in there somehow?
Sumica: lol get this, apparently the 360 version's A.I. is horrible, can't even navigate straight paths while YOU got one that makes 3000 foot jumps
...I think we do,
alein swarm a good game
Kipkat07_USAF: ok, cool

DoctoDoctorWho: true,but remember what i said before,if she was really this nice and generous,she would have declined spike giving it too her!
thelonecubone|BL2: hello :)
sonicrainboomer259: Accepting a gift is no lack of generosity, infact, that is the point of generosity. To give. If one cannot recive, they are not truly generous.

AJIsHaunter we've watched game of thrones here
Hi, AdamTheDuck. :)

AJIsAwesome and game of thrones isn't
13hrm

AdamThePsyduck: :D nice nick
alexxm: That too. I guess you'll have to talk to the mods about it, but I doubt that it might be streamed here.

I loved how the amulet came from some old asian guy in a store XD
haha ya
reference to so many movies...
Just like in Gremlins :3
Might as well have bought a Mogwai.
Also, 18:27. There was a great disturbence in the force, as if thousands of fanfic writers cried out in glee.
According to herbert moon the jews killed lincoln.
LadyCanary: ah. Gremlins, didn't watch that in a long time!
that was actually the aliens
trixie was like "shut up and take mah monee!" *throwsbag of gold
DoctoDoctorWho: XDDD Oh god.
asian guy :"would you like that wrappedup" XD
i loved that part
DoctoDoctorWho: The R63 bit? :D
Giftwrapped*
DoctoDoctorWho: what happened in that timeframe?
Yes, Applemac
If only she actually turned Applejack into a stallion XD
Even though I was still fooled, r63 AJ looked a bit, weightly.
we give tutorials
jcelios: Nah, that would make magic EXTREMELY OP. :D
DoctoDoctorWho: I like that in the end the writers were saying "these spells are impossible or borderline impossible, so don't even go there fanfic writers" :D
I say best ep since the premire
and age spells don't?
hai everypony /)
promote tumblrs, commission statusses, contests and much more!

*criminal
Stop right there, criminal scum!
d3rb: naw, to far

Gaurds, Take him away >:I
Nightly: Advertising's against the rules. :)
DoctoDoctorWho: Ikr, I like how they're shooting down stupid theories though :D
Buytoast: Is that backseat modding?

suddenly the drawing got stunningly realistic
sonicdude558: Shizu is.

Oooh :3
nice fire
it will be when it takes forever to get here
/me is not a streamer
And in all honesty, I never hated trixie.
jcelios, meh, i can see pixels, could be better imo
i always wubed trixie
Vivix: I was saying vivi, but since nobody knows who that is anymore, its affect is lost
was 3rd favorite pony
cowvarkian: I do. :<
now might be 2nd
dat bass
AJIsHaunter: I know
I gotta go in 5 mins
Well, she's not coming back, so I'm not surprised anyone knows her name
/me skips around twirling streamers and singing
noone*
AJIsHaunter: but you've been here for more then a week
:D
so we are all just chatting by the campfire?
just test - gak
AJIsHaunter: did u see pic? i think is good
Vivix: Isn't she just having hard drive problems?
Yule log. And yes ^_^
For 7 months?
trixie_squirtle: I did. I like it. :)
Vivix: it can happen

i love yule logs ^u^
A hdd costs less than a two day dinner
Vivix: i know ._.
Vivix: If she isn't coming back, I'm pretty sure the mods would've told us that.
Vivix: She doesnt need to, she got a recurrance which is a helluva lot more than any other villan, and she also may be a resident now.
I don't think so, of course, she might, she might not
13actually i'll be occupied for a while it seems... will let someone else go
Vivix, just wanted to ping you

13silly question if wrek or sumi are watching, if you get PS2 through steam does it have to redownload everything or would it update the existing install?
i never played of any call of duty... think this series boring as shit
Eeyup.

Buytoast: I NEVER drink Mountain Dew with out mah Doritos~
i thought someone was telling me this was a playstation 2 game
Lel
pony_3450 agree
Shizuka, I presume it would update. Would be kind of a waste of space to redownload everything
This is a PS2 game? :P
well i feel like a complete dumbass
Scoot-Scootaloo: I salute you for scaring me but also resent you for scarring me
Buytoast: :D
they better be the Master Cheese flavored ones Scoot-Scootaloo
Buytoast: dont worry, i had the same thought as you
otherwise you aren't eating like a true gamer
food is done. I will br back
Buytoast: Nah, they're the Uber Prestige Ranch ones
dem polygons
They come with Nightvision goggles!
Shizuka Not sure if it's answered but no you need to redownload the whole game. If you want it on steam

Hooray, I finished my OC drawing ^^
CountDoofus: Hooray! :3
alexxm, didn't expect you to say something like that XD
why would you draw it
when you could use the pony generator
And no, it's not a black coated, red maned alicorn with dragon eyes
and make one that is the definition of perfection
CountDoofus whats it like?
WHAT
inb4 it is.
alexxm: http://fav.me/d5mytt8

Nice job! Does he have a name?
A very defined chin he has.

08,01AJIsHaunter: sapling
Ah....
CountDoofus: could you send me that link?
08,01which is my pet nae for your mother
Kipkat07_USAF, parents are weird like that. They fuss at you to do your homework, then they want you to stop doing your homework to help with something they ccan probably do themselves, but fuss when you haven't finished the homework

and I LOVE those headbands
I recognize Johnny's voice from somewhere
dat face!!!!
Their faces always scare me
00,10it's the old JQ wrek
00,10and yeah the ep is called "the invisiable monster"
actually more like The Blob x The Thing x Invasion of the Body Snatchers
Star wars reference
I remember that guy in questworld due to how that times 3d were it scared the hell out of me. Don't remember the villains name though
killerpony7733: Stain maybe?

killerpony7733: no that was from Iron man
Kencolt: eeyup
otakon Oh darn but yeah
Kencolt: I guess I'm too apathetic for JQ. :P
also, I think Cam Clarke voices someone....
<--- WHITE HUMANITY; SCREW YOU
Because of Venture Brothers, at times I cant look at Jonny Quest the same way.
13Wrek: although, with the new quest, digital doublecross was the only one i ever saw
00,10wrek seasion 1 ep 20
I could never get into Johnny Quest as a kid for some reason.
Wrek: If by any chance you have the Invisible Monster, or the Mummy, from the original JQ, well... Vordox would be... impressed.

Kencolt: Oh for te 1960s? Maybe. :P But I've seen worse when I was younger so might be that I'm just weird. XD
Shizuka: at least they arent invisible
Although, when you think about it, aren't BOTH episodes borrowing from Forbidden Planet, the classic movie?
Zero fucks given, Shizu. :3
And flamethrowers
Shizuka: lolit gets crazier

otakon: a poorly animated monster
00,10so dose this signafi brain damage?
Sumica: it's a psychic thing, not mental
Sumica: Haji-- for some reasonj-- can't seem to enter. He can only advise. Then again, Jonny can't enter without Hadji, so it balances out.
Wut's dis
<-- Was there ever a JQ game?
Heh and we're at the season that John de Lancie voiced Dr.Quest too
Vordox: I'm pretty sure there was
Vordox: probably

Trust me-- in the 60's when you're a kid-- This cared the PISS out of you.

Reminds me of a boss from Super MEtroid I played when I was 9 :P
It looks silly
Or its a one-eyed Pac Man qhost
leaves footprints
ghost
that thing must have taken the drawers 10 seconds
Kencolt: so, you were a kid in the 1960's then
to draw
05how wonky
Kencolt: or being a kid seeing it ehnever it played for you
HOLY SHIT IT DOES WORK FOR iOS!
cowvarkian: I'm 55 years old. I saw it at BROADCAST. Yes.
I LOVE YOU USTREAM!
Hey Dari, yeah it has been a while.
They played this on TV when I was a little kid in the 1970's.
Kencolt: so, yes ok
albeit with EXTREME lag
Kencolt: It's kinda funny...
>.>
Kencolt: It wasn't that scary, reminds me of a few certain monsters from Scooby Doo, (The electrical monster for example)
05now i am hungry
And before anypony asks, Yes, I am usually the oldest person here, I'm sometimes calles the elder, and I do know a few things.

after my time on the internet, i cant see this as scary
AJIsHaunter: Are you shocked at my age?
cachi01: ikr
LEEDLE LEEDLE LEE
This was actually very tricky animation. No lines, no sketches-- they more or less had to animate the monster almost freehand.
trixie_squirtle: I haven't been frightened for a while now
DocSane: Sort of. I just never thought you were that old compared to Ken.
Inb4 Benton dies
