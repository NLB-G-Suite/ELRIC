Its...Impossible o_o
you know whats more awesome, the comment question of the day which comes from a user anmed BAM and he says
may i have a hug Princess_Luna?
I know right, I remember playing Heroes 3, and this looks so much better (even though HoMM3 is a classic)
Yes you may MB.
/me hugs
/me returns hug
10,02Is that Heroes?
And I'm like Pinkie. I looked at the description and striked through what wasn't me. I ended up with "I love parties... and I'm creative... but I love parties"
Yes SB
its so good to be a grown alicorn again?
Parties are good.
SuperBrony64: i think its heroes 6
10,02I need to get that game...but my computer probably isn't cool enough to handle it :/
i have ponies... on my screen
HELLO BRONYSTATE
Looks like Fallout 1 and 2...But better graphics.
ohai BronyKing
How are you an alicorn though? Another dimension? Way to make me feel worse about being a filly MasterBrony...
Hihi BronyKing
Only part of me like Rainbow Dash is that I'm loyal.
/me has a delicious candy bar that her sister bought for her. Feels good~
05,15I took that personality test, and I got ZERO in common with rainbow dash
hehe
im an alicorn, so when i do marry Luna
we are the same species
I wouldn't think I had any in common with twilight or Fluttershy...that isn't right...
/me has soup couldn't be happier
@superbrony64, your PC can run skyrim it can run anything (like mine)
which test?
Remember what I said MB?
http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=MjUxOXwxOTEwMTg
skyrim isnt that bad
BF3 is far harsher on a pc
WOW
true
self centerd much?
I'm taking the damn test again.
not you
the REAL Luna
What?
I'm surprised I'm like Rarity, but I do obsess over little details
i got fluttershy yaay~

Flaria!! :D I didnt see you thar.
/me hugs LadyCanary
Ohai again
Funny, I know a pony named Flare...
/me hugs Flaria back. You always give the nicest hugs ^-^
The problem about Rainbow Dash is I avoid competition. I never go headstrong into an issue
I got mostly Twilight and Applejack

/me "I'm doing rather well. I'm off on an adventure tomorrow, so I've been busy sorting things out. I've got a bit of headache though."
Lol...Just a total gap away from rainbow dash Fluttercry.
D'awww fluttercry :3
fluttercry: woah
fluttercry, that is an uncanny formation...
so, it's firmly established that fluttercry is NOT Rainbow Dash.
no rainbow dash? not even a little
yay fluttercry
05,15None. I was expecting Fluttershy and Twilight to be high though
/me "I was 100% rainbow dash, and 100% applejack"
/me "and 50% Twi
/me "Does that make me 250% pony?"
that reminds me of a song
I really haven't seen anyone be like Rarity, unless they like fashion
I wonder what would happen if you got 100 percent on all of them...
You can't be, because that would be 250% which is impossible.
eyup Globetrotter
/me "ALL THE PONIES!"
/me things Globetrotter should /me less
amnesia the dark desent. that guy on his friends list will die soon
/me "Do you mean 'thinks' Phase4?"
05dayum ravagers are OP
05,15also that probably explains why I don't like Rainbow Dash very much
SPOON
/me ment thinks, thx Globetrotter
/me Amnesia Put me in a mental hospital called my own room for a week.
>/)<
i'm not sure how you could be 100% of two ponies, seems unlikely
fluttercry wow, 0 dash
/me "Not a problem my dear fellow, Phase4"
Now I really wanna buy Amnesia
Should I link the Amnesia video again?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLHlZcDT35U
Heroes 6

If you transcribe audio, it forecasts the monster by saying "Oh shit"
05,15Heroes of MIght and Magic 6 I believe
unfoundbug, would you mind brushing me?
flutter_spin: no links to youtube during streams
05,15also, I REALLY need to play amnesia
Ingwaz http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=MjAwNXwxNjc1MDY
The* Shit

^yes^
:O awwww
00,03Rainbow Dash, Buck Yeah!
recorded?
suddenly http://youtu.be/8QVlTWTxO4U
Globetrotter: a very odd result, especially if you answered as honestly as you could. While applejack and rainbow dash are both fiercely loyal, beyond that and their athleticism, theyre very different ponies
at night
Heyo Everypony :D
ohai [SWAG]thehated5689
05,15I actually love my result. No one else has zero!
lol
Sweet Celestia, my whole system just left or a while

Shockwave: CRASHED
ok now im back i got DCd
hey hated5689
how goes it?
that is my result, i feel it is off slightly in the twilight sparkle area as I do enjoy reading and can be a very studious person
05,15and then [SWAG]thehated5689 showed up and ate all our bananas
/me "A rather large amount of lag right now"
I do see a lot of AJ
do you like bananas?
Windows Task Manager: NOT RESPONDING
Hello hated, too bad I'm leaving for a bit, goodbye, my profile will still be on here, sleep mode away...
do you like mmmm bananas
Windows Task Manager: NOT RESPONDING (is that bad)
The_4th_Wall: ikr, look for 'process explorer'. its better
uhh... umm... im not sure
The_4th_Wall: and yes, thats bad. very bad
ooooo a building
What is this?
i have about 5 different games i plaiying right now. most of them replaying
00,03Well guys, it looks like I have to do some Super Important College stuff.
00,03I'll be back later.
Pfft, college

eh, college. Never did officially graduate from college
cya scoot
Cya

Alright. See ya later Scoot-Scootaloo.
So, did that mean my computer was basically a heated coaster at that point?
bye Scoot-Scootaloo
Bye Scoo-Aw...
5 years and they still said I couldn't "officially" graduate
Just got here. Looks like Heroes, but better graphics. Heroes VI?
08,01http://du.cx/1oD
11,01Hi all. I have a special surprise for everyone if I can stream. You might like it.
:)
UNTIL ALL ARE ONE
Bye ... aww...
suhpries?
...Is that actually a innocent discord....My mind HAS BEEN BLOWN.
I think Wrek's streaming right now
http://i.imgur.com/L5gVZ.jpg
/me was too late
Ooooh :3 I wonder what it could be Nittany_Discord.
Ohai RAWRity~
where does one take this personality quiz?
http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/
rawrity, was that intentionally done?
Ingwaz: no
11,01You might like it.
http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/
But seriously, Task Manager not responded. So, did that mean my computer was basically a heated coaster at that point?
just me answering truthfully.
lol. I had like 30 tabs. Maybe I should close some
how can someone embody such extremes of multiple personalities in one mind?
11,01And it is an MP game, so maybe people here can join me.
that might be the problem
game of what Nittany_Discord?
sounds interesting Nittany_Discord
what game?
Is this Heroes Of Might and Magic? a new One?
Ingwaz: I'm a very complex individual.
just went from chrome AND firefox, 12 tabs each, to just chrome, 5 tabs
Nittany_Discord Has gotten my intention of wanting too see this mp game >_>
I'm very much like Twilight, just I don't like reading books.
11,01It's nothing new, but you might still like the stream.
RAWRity: perhaps you are, but i cant hardly see such 4 wide personalities to the extreme of their original element
Jaketehsnake: This is Heroes 6
08,01anyone streaming currently?
Wrek is currently streamin
05bugger took out most of my forces :C
looks like i cant afford to got too IYC this summer in colorado, cant afford it. aw well. ill be doing other things
Ah. Last one I played was III Jim -.-
The music reminds me of God of war
05,15Okay next time I find myself in the possession of 20 dollars I'm buying Amnesia
Ingwaz: what's funny is, for 3 of them, I'm only slightly above average.
ikr
/me is my own desktop background
lol
i have amnesia :)
FINALLY!!!
Heroes III was awesome and is still a classic
after 10000 distractions
I have 10 bucks I dont know what too do with...Any reccomendations my pony friends?
/me is his own desktop background
i could do a playthrough of it...
RAWRity: i'm not sure if thats your average, or the actual average of users all over
i just finished god of war 3 for today
Do they still have Bastian sale for $7
His. dammit
08,01hey fluttercry, is it on steam?
i finished the test 4th wall posted
Dang. Dem Graphics!
i got RD
i'll have to take the test again and see how it matches up to your average
Okay Imma stop lurking now...
hi everypony ^_^
05,15no but someone showed a video and it was freaking hillarious
hay 4th
hiya chicken
Heya ScootaChicken....
is there a way to post my score?
EEY wussup
hi ScootaChicken
Ingwaz: the dotted line is the average user, the purple is me. So for 3, I'm only slighty more like RD AJ and TS than most.
amnesia? it is on steam
Milky Ways part gets me everytime
fluttercry its hillarius to everyone BUT the person playing
that game messes with your head
amnesia is on steam
is Wrek the one streaming
05,15I like games like that
yeah, it scares you bad.
I still want that game tho
I wouldn't want to play it
im partly like rainbow dash, mostly like applejack and little bit like fluttershy
Don't know why, 'cause I hate to get scared ^^
I'm back
i went in expecting scary even after watching a letsplay still got me everytime
Its like watching a grown scottish man with pink hair in a tootoo spinning in circles in front of you.
OHAI OTAKON
Welcome back otakon
05,15And you don't have to do that
08,01Aircrafter: actually, i have a gif of that somewhere

http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=NjUyMnwzMTE
I need to get one tomorrow
08,01fluttercry: you sure? seriously, i ain't gonna spend it on anything
The reaction videos of that game are great. Watched one of a scottish lady freaking out when mere ambient sounds were around her.
08,01i don't play games
Over the graph, there's a link to this
i think that's it
08,01ScootaChicken: mohawk
08,01bright green
dear god no
I tried a mohawk once
never again
You go into amnesia expecting millions of monsters and puzzles, but there is hardly any monsters at all till you get later in game.
05,15I just can't accept that. But that's a really generous offer. Thanks.
oh my, I just got back 500 EUR from the scout assosiation
hello everypony :)
my favorite walkthrough that i saw was dead space by hateworkboy on youtube

If you want good freakouts on youtube, Check Out Psychadelicsnake.
when did Fluttershy close?
Aircrafter: You still get scared when a clusterbuck of sounds come in the game in the beggining.
05,15I'll think about that

I havent eaten in 2 HOURS!
/me glomps everyone in the chat
these fillys need food^
MasterBrony: You are 0% kind....
Red_Pegasus: Seen plenty of walkthroughs, its scary because you always expect a monster too pop out when there is the music. BUT IT. NEVER. HAPPENS.
So far, My chart is still the biggest!
i havent eaten in an hour
Ima Go make NACHOS!
lol
Bring me some
sry, just reminded me of the video
OK! Sour Cream and Salsa?
Aircrafter: That's why you turn the music off.
i got a flu :P so no food wanted
so i just downloaded my first game on steam since i wiped my computer
Salsa with Habanero
@Red_Pegasus....thats a load of tar
youtube! y u break over ipv6
Would be cool to play Portal 2 with someone
im actually a very nice person
Then you realize that the game is just trying to be scary.
Devaner: But the music is what makes the game so good. You just cant turn it off and continue. You have too have it.
20% cooler, Slightly more hyper than proper, not very well-read, a bit of a hard worker, and not shy at all
08,01Aircrafter: http://adb39.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/smallspin.gif
Okey dokey lokey I'll Bring Saywhat some!

RAWRity: i took the test again, here is my result http://i40.tinypic.com/esjl2u.jpg
Most heroes games I've played took over 3 hours to finish
the average is far different than the one yours showed, so theres something else to it
The ship was a seapony!

RawketLawnchair: Lawl
05,15Has anyone ever watched old commercials from their childhood, and realized you could remember stuff from then better than stuff that happened last week? Or is that just me?
RawketLawnchair: You should totally use it...See what happens.

mom?
yes?
older commercials were just so catchy

Hi %Nittany_Discord !
SWAG
I have short term memory loss
11,01Hi princess of the night.
that sux :P
So, good commercials = stored in time capsule?
flutterdash: hmm?
But at the same time, i'm a genius :P
Nittany_Discord, what happened to the game you was talking about/
So why do you have a percent instead of an @ or +?
hiya Nittany_Discord!
11,01Because I'm new.
Princess_Luna: half op
Oh...K?
+ is techie
hop status
@ is full mod
OK.
what do the @,+, and % mean is that like rank or something/
or adminitstrato
11,01I can do most mod stuff, but I'm not above the @'s.
TheDr: yeah, basically
/me facehoofs
cool
11,01The ranks dictate powers in the channel.
what is the difference between a half op and a mod?
So how do you get the newsletter for here?
/me facehooves but hits himself by accident
Ok.
TheDr: + means talk power, % means half-op and @ means full-op
done that before
thats wat i was told
just took the test unfoundbug linked im most like fluttershy and applejack
11,01Half-ops can do what ops can except Op others (I think) and kick any op.
Nittany_Discord is only a B rank user. . . his power is still incredible!
/me heals SayWhat with friendship
/me is all better
is there a Jeopardy! stream available
?
Nittany_Discord: what different powers do half ops and mods have?
who do you become an ops?
http://silentwulf.com/pony.htm
Princess_Luna: ask one of the mods, thats what i did
oopss
how*
damn cntrl v
11,01When we open up applications for mods.
cool
I've been trying to look up ad-blocking, but doesn't seem to be a solution
it is
good excuse MasterBrony ;D
I use it it works fine
Same
well
i didn't play that but that kinda looked staged for what it was
11,01flutter_spin: AdBlock Plus
its true
Dem Castle Walls.
that was an accident
lol okj
Plus? hmm. Maybe.
nice MasterBrony but it's okay since this isn't an "official" stream atm
assuming 'damn ctrl+v'
11,01Also mario_pony, Both % an @ can kick and ban and change channel modes, but I think only @ can op and half-op others.
surely its a ctrl-c issue not a ctrl v
this is the only chatroom i actually visit:S
11,01Also, %'s can't kick or ban @'s.
so, like i said
is there a Jeopardy! stream available
robodragon6: me to
11,01ctrl+v = paste.
so the order goes % + @????
no
oh good to know Nittany_Discord also why would you wanna kick or ban a mod?
or + % @
glue=paste
yeah im shy like FS
yes, but ctrl v would of worked fine, putting whats on the clipbaord to the chat
11,01Dunno.
11,01Other than for fun.
lol
so by the transitive prop ctrl + V+ glue
Did he say Raggle Fraggle?
11,01Or to stage a coup.
???
fillyfillyy: + % @I think, thats the order in the chat-member-list-thingy
11,01:p
=* wow i cant stop failling to day i blame the flu :(
Nittany_Discord: coup?
Nittany: Technically anyone with ban permissions can set a ban that would effect someone above their rank, unless I misremember my IRC stuffs. It's the actual physical KICK that ops can't do to higher-ranked ops.
ok kool diddutz
whats up bronystate?
!espeon
+ < % < @ ?
ohai Morty
/me feels like being a parasprite(isgiddy) but not want ban
Hi Nittany_Discord
and heyo morty
13CriticKitten: voices and up are exempt from bans anyway
When they're in the channel, yes.
does anyone remember what episode this is?
/me says what
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju61D6u404g&feature=related
11,01Hi TOY_PON3|Drawing
(+<%<@)/0=undefined.
lool
No no no man, you're making me fall asleep. It's say whaaaaaaaat
whta is coup?
nope. still ads.
mind you, I saw LordCelestia kick Ghosties last night during a +m
But that's not what bans do. They're meant to keep people from coming back to a channel. :p
Princess_Luna: Btw just to let you know your mane is from season 1 not season 2
and Ghosties is a full op and LC's still a halfie
coup is the rebel alliance
hops can't kick ops.
I'll just deal with it.
I know, it isn't glowing now...stupid ancient spell books...
If LC kicked Ghosties, he wasn't identified for his nick.
Morty "Owl's well"?
So he wasn't opped.
In theory (at least on another network I frequent), you can set a ban on the channel's owner while he's gone, for example, you just can't actually kick him while he's there. :p
o yeah i think thats right
Good cause I have no idea how to draw season 2 mane :)
i couldnt remember
13channel founder is exempt from everything
why didn't scoots become dash's assistant?
You can ban any hostname.
Shizuka! :3
Including founder's.
who is the channel founder?
I am.
so many questions
which is why we respect his authority implicitly and incur no rath to be removed from this chat
13shadowircd doesn't set +q and +a for those ranks
13unreal ircd does
^
dari: See, I thought I remembered that correctly. It's the *kick* that is restricted by setting, right?
Is darth vader my father?
can only mods stream?
6_9
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc&list=PLDF1B4C469E6308E9&index=21&feature=plpp_video
CriticKitten: Since as Shizuka said there's no +q/+a for owner and protected, the other ops can still kick me.
ah
TheDr: eeeyup
Even though I'm woner.
too much responsibility for me. Just as long as I don't get kicked.
owned*
Yeah.
owner*
Only mods have the power
Woner
New word of the day
Woner you say?
11,01It must run off of a different IRC server client altogether.
hmm
God dammit.
MasterBrony: Thank you for that excellence
would you stop with the 20% cooler space link
youre welcome
lol
11,01There are no %, +a, or founder there.
:D
11,01Just @ and +/
Knew that, I was more talking about the difference between ban and kick. I seem to recall that ban is just a way to block entry, it can't be enforced with a kick if the person outranks you. And they could just lift said ban then, anyways. :p
this link is the new rickroll
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc&list=PLDF1B4C469E6308E9&index=21&feature=plpp_video
Well there was no % on ponychat a while ago, but it has since been added.
At least if I'm remembering it right.
i got kicked once
why did i click the link???
for spamming
Stop it with the space link
one of these days i'll end up with 8 tabs of that vid
LAWL RICKROLLD
Spaceroll'd
IDEA
this is now canon
I got kicked once...or twice...didn't actually spam, just threatened to...
But I like the space song
Don't know for sure since different networks and setups tend to do it differently. I just know how it worked on another network I frequent. XP
I prefer Derp Roll'd
:'( you aren't supposed to be mean to me

13in any event, irc clients recognize +q, +a, +o, +h, and +v as the five ranks of user, just depends on what ircds make use of them
awesome link
11,01A friend made it.
13in the RFC, only +o and +v are defined
Oh my god WIN.
ENJOYING IT
Space is 20% + Wheatley + Space core
Nittany_Discord: Oh I seen that on your tumblr :D
same here TOY_PON3|Drawing
I see those idiots at UbiSoft still haven't fixed that bug in Heroes VI.
11,01Yeah.
Increase combat speed = squeaky creatures.
To go with Nittany_Discord's video: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-lets-get-to-that-party-quick.gif
I'mma get on firefox so I can infinite loop this.
Lasharus: Fix? Bug? Ubisoft?
this is a spam threat hoofs in the air where i can see em dont any pony move!!!!! :|
Point.
Jim: Humans...really?
11,01Ubisoft.
I just found Heroes VI rather a disappointment. :P
11,01*me bawls*
they look freaky
only really got into 3
they look freaky
Nittany_Discord will you link me to your tumblr?
Needs more lawl
AJ looks high
they look freaky
11,01I wouldn't touch an Ubisoft game with a 10ft pole.
after that they took out the lich unit which was my fav :P
I decided the same recently Nittany_Discord.
11,01http://www.tumblr.com/blog/nittany-tiger
alright...Now whats the name of the video again ._.
Nittany_Discord: how about 11ft
11,01Maybe 50ft.
request denied
Whaaaaaa
you always need liches and skeletons
I don't get mad at companies. I look at their game result.
same here
11,01http://nittany-tiger.tumblr.com/
Lasharus: Not a surprise. I think Heroes 5 is likely to be the last salvagable one in the series since it's the first one Ubisoft made and thus is the last one to be made BEFORE Ubi had a chance to screw virtually everything up.
oops sorry about saying that 3 times, my computer glitched
is tumblr any good?
:D Ah Nittay you has tumblr?
Nittany*
11,01I get mad at companies that screw gamers over, which is pretty much any AAA publisher nowadays.
yes TheDr you should get one too
It's likely to continue downhill from here, albeit slowly.
11,01Ubisoft is one of the worst though.
I have one too ^-^
Nittany: Blizzard?
05imo, the 6th isnt that bad
UbiSoft is immensely bad at it. Their DRM is astonishingly bad.
Id say activision is worse thoguh
Or activision or EA
i think i just fellt my brain move when i sneezed
Here's a fun fact:
fillyfillyy: i have no idea what i would do on it tho
poor infinity ward
11,01I hate Activision less than I used to.
TheDr i request your assistance
Wrek: It does have some good features to it.
EA is pretty good atm
On january first, their uplay servers were down. People contacted UbiSoft to get it fixed.
fillyfillyy: what do ya need?
11,01EA bans people from playing games.
I know certain companies get bad rep, but I objectively look at their product. Then again, their product reflects their rep
But I don't think it's as good as 5, myself.
Not happening. Why? Well, Tech Support'd gone home for the weekend.
i like EA
...
One ruined C&C and one money whored COD
i like trains
And it's likely to just keep getting worse, sadly.
Gearbox is very good about their customer service
Gearbox is great.
treyarch gave me zombies. theyre alright by me
TheDr: cut my head open i need you to look and make sure my silly filly brain is where it should be i felt it moce
11,01EA is trying to be a third parent.
11,01They are Orwellian with their titles.
have you seen the claptrap marraige proposal?
No
that was best proposal ever
Either way the only games i buy from them now are Mass effect and few other good titles
"cuts into fillyfillyy's head" yeps its still there
Frankly, I think I'll just avoid EA/UbiSoft for the time being.
11,01And don't get me started on Online Passes.
That was awesome, yeah The_4th_Wall
Black March, onboard
johnjoseco is online on DA be ready for him to join soon
Activision is a no no i will never buy shit from them again
EA's screwed over enough series for me, and UbiSoft's DRM pissed me off more than enough.
is it connected correctly TheDr?
my jaw literally dropped
Who's playing btw?
Nittany: I hate Blizzard nowadays mostly because it's decided to do things that are distinctly bad business practice, but gets away with it because the games are still pretty good and generate absurd cash.
I must leave, goodbye!
DRM?
bye Princess_Luna
by a long cord of happy nerves? yes!!
I think Wrek is
cu Princess_Luna
For example: I know Bethesda is known for having a lot of bugs, but I still liked Skyrim for its setting
So, anyone else preordering Borderlands 2?
Um okay, later Princess_Luna
My username will still be here though!
11,01CriticKitten: That's the story of every game publisher now.
Ulthane: Digital Rights Management. Essentially anti-piracy programs.
to bad i dont know how to close this head :P
11,01They all get away with everything they do.
Just go on my DA, it will be uploaded there
oh
I'd love a borderland 2, yeah
my computer's being wierd. ill see you guys later.
I dislike Turbine & Cryptic for the F2P services, but I still like the game
TOY_PON3|Drawing link me to your DA?
Blizzard's the worst offender now, though. Diablo 3, now with forced DRM for everypony!
Anything from CD-keys to UbiSoft's astonishingly bad always-online bullshit.
Borderlands 2 For the Fricken win
CriticKitten: UbiSoft got there first :P
11,01Because most gamers don't know or don't care about not buying from them.
Only dev and publisher i trust is valve
bbc in a sec
BL2 has been public for a while, Jim
11,01I trust Valve and indie companies.
And I'll give Blizzard this much: At least they can be more or less relied on to keep the bloody servers online, as opposed to UbiSoft.
I played Diablo 3. The charm is gone.
Lasharus: Yes, but Ubi can't forcibly shove it down people's throats like Blizzard.
Same here
yeah, I know, but I'd love to play it
Maybe some others but valve is the only i know wont screw you up for cash
TOY_PON3|Drawing you just got a new watcher :D
I felt Torchlight was better
diablo3 was a joke
Whaddya mean they can't? They have, and they will.
thanks fillyfillyy
a single player game that required an online connection
Face it, a Blizzard title sells approximately 80 billion million copies. :|
Ok
'was' a joke unfoundbug? It's not even OUT yet.
'Gunzerker' will dual-weild
There's coming a torchlight 2, with ONLINE play
11,01Blizzard will force always-on into the industry because D3 will sell like hotcakes.
i am kidkiddkiddd
yes was a joke
now its just sad
I'll wait for the game itself.
And the whole online store? lol, what was it... Korea that forced them to make a version without it?
11,01So major publishers will follow because it's profitable.
DAT plush
omg i want that luna
They can do whatever they want and it will STILL sell, which is why they bastardized Diablo 3 into a half-baked MMO and killed its singleplayer.
I've always greatly enjoyed the Diablo franchise. I might not like the bollocks around it, but the games themselves are usually solid.
D3 will be horrible a monthly pay system is just not right anything before D3 was buy and play
I'll die of laughter
and that other one
...
Not play and pay every month
A monthly pay system?
/me dies cause he doesnt have Pinkie Pie plushie
What insane site have you been reading?
Yes Diablo 3 will be that
No it won't.
/me uses phoenix down on fillyfillyy
11,01Call of Duty is turning into an MMO.
Diablo 3 isn't ptp
Oh, did they switch D3 to a pay-to-play model? Really?
No they didn't.
ugh, Call of Duty. PR disaster
it is not effective Jim
/me uses Pinkie doll on fillyfillyy
Lasharus give me a source and ill change my statement
11,01Maybe in a couple of years.
any pony else going to get the MLPFIM friendship exspress dvd when it comes out?
Give ME a source to your statement.
it is extremely effective
Because yours is by far the more unlikely and illogical.
shall i lose this i will die again
Call of Duty= death of treyarch/infinityward's triple a ratings
I be back ^.^
All I've heard so far is that it includes DRM, has no offline singleplayer, features a shop system identical to major MMOs and numerous other MMO features in its gameplay, and has a new singleplayer mode that can't be solo'd, effectively making it an MMO in all but name.
BRB
11,01Activision is pretty much untouchable because of the mass popularity of CoD. Kotick could eat a baby in public and get away with it.
I hadn't heard anything about P2P for D3.
Modern Marfare 3: Call of Filly.
eeyup CriticKitten
Zero Punctuation of Call of Duty = Classic
lol
That's pretty much accurate CriticKitten.
but I'm still buying ME3 when it comes out
11,01otakon1: And support EA?
05im not
Though it CAN be solo'd, just probably not the highest difficulty levels.
I'm not doing it for EA
Hey derpy|With_Guest
i support nintendo
In that it's pretty similar to Diablo II, really. :P
I saw ME3 and....honestly I don't get the hype
Hello
Lasharus: no, he means you can't play the game offline
11,01I hate publisher X, but will still buy their game = support for the publisher in the eyes of the publisher.
im back
i am no longer punctually correct when referring to call of duty
oh wait, did anyone else see the Book of Records say that um.. what was it, Black Ops voted best ending?
11,01And publisher X will continue to screw you over.
Nittany_Discord - which is why i haven't bought either MW3 or Battlefield 3
CriticKitten: it makes more sense if you play and complete the first two
But that's still not a monthly pay-to-play system otakon1.
11,01And lobby for SOPA-like shit.
I wonder what a amnesia Sequel would be like.
and never plan to
It looked like an ordinary shooter. Isn't this the franchise that integrated RPG elements into its gameplay? Because they didn't appear at all.
Im turning my laptop off soon
So ill still be on my phone
I never will either
Nvm guess i read the most far out statement then guess diablo 3 wont be a pay to play basis
Unless you want to argue that you have to pay for the internet itself, making it a monthly pay to play thing.
Lasharus: no, but it's practically a MMO now witht the MUST ALWAYS BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERENET business
11,01Because they have investors-over-consumers syndrome.
Still i got a feeling they are gonna butcher the series due to lore
cod & bf are dead to me
Oh I know.
btw johnjoseco will use the nickname JJ
any company which supports sopa can aadd another name to the people who pirate their games
I strongly dislike it myself.
did anypony know SOPA is soup in spanish?
ugh... and speaking of Bethesda games and bugs...
Ok
lol
damn it
it's one thing for me to get a crash error once when i try to fast travel...
my stream went dead AGAIN
fuck you LimeV
but now i've just gotten one 3 times in a row for the same fast travel inFNV
hehe. GoDaddy supported SOPA ans lost 200,000 people
11,01SOPA is couch in Spanish.
i think sopa means trash in Swedish too
ME gusta
Eh, even if I had played ME1 and 2, I wouldn't like 3, I think.
well Nittany_Discord, i can tell you this, until capcom fixes their errors and starts thinking straight again, i refuse to buy any of their products
It looks like a plain vanilla shooter.
11,01I doubt they will.
3 has a nice idea which has been missing, multiple play modes
Nittany_Discord: no sofa is couch in spanish
I love the combat in ME. It sort of a "hey guys, have combat like this"
I wonder what'll happen with RE6.
The demo provided at E3 was a shooter. A pretty looking one but still just a shooter
As far as I'm concerned, Diablo III might have a bloody good story, and the gameplay could hold up pretty well - I don't know, I'm not in the beta - so I'll probably get it and enjoy it.
ME?
able to play RPG, shooter or story mode
Lasharus i somehow just know so much lore will be retconned and what not blizzard simply will and they are known for it
Mass Effect
We'll see.
Hello PonyGirl_82!!!!!!!
I can't wait until hollywood sees people pulling thier support and stops funding SOPA
I wont be buying it either way
11,01These companies won't change for the better unless they start posting losses, and even then they still might not change.
Some retcons may come up, but overall, the storylines are meshed reasonably well together.
what game is this?
wait... with the req to have internet connection to play single player games, when the company goes bust we will no longer be able to play even single player?
Hello mario_pony
CriticKitten: ofc, they've been making it more shooter like since the first game
BLizzard is coming out with a new game in 2015, it's called Titan. It was a on a leaked template for releases
no?
11,01THQ still pitches the used sales lie for example.
Tey are also making a Warcraft movie
That's hardly news SayWhat. :P
Nittany_Discord: if they dont, then i hope the company goes out of business. I do not say that out of some misguided hate. Just that I would rather see my formerly favorite company end than continue on a sham of its former self
I got Diablo 3 beta. You only get to do 1 section. Get to about level 9 by yourself and get 3 abilities.
Possibly but blizzard simply will destroy much the original fans liked
Hi everypony, Im back!
Ulthane: eeyup, if the servers ever go down you can't play D3 anymore
hiya tgl1992
It is all the news in zeh world!
They did it with the warcraft lore
But then you, well, do it over and over to see the other abilities/classes
Yeah, they said that about StarCraft II as well pony_7733. I frankly adored it.
11,01Right now, I hope the entire industry crashes.
otakon: that's... wrong
Starcraft 2 is still a solid game though.
So as far as I'm concerned, people can doomspeak all they like. If I enjoy it, that's what matters to me.
Starcraft II was actually k but yeah not solid
It just features some bad business decisions.
Got it, i got stuck and quit
Ulthane: I know it is, try telling that to Blizzard
%Nittany_Discord: What do you mean?
Like "LAN play? Who needs that lol?"
and the game STILL isn't out
I presume Wrek is still streaming
Nittany_Discord please dont say that i would actually like a job
koreans?
well he was
Yarn
/me doesn't know what everypony is talking about!!!
but my stream went kaput
and a reason for this 4 year masters degree
stand back im a bout to make a pony comic sorta
bc LIMEV HATES ME AND ONLY ME!
im with you mario_pony
We are discussing games mario pony
SC2 was awesome. Story was there, good story on its own, but terrible seeing it from SC1 point of view
it's working for me otakon, you should try refreshing
mario, games industry in general
11,01So you can work for someone that will tell you what to do and profit off of your work?
Imagine this: online gaming VANISHES off the face of the earth for one month.
05,15it had been so long since I played SC1 that I had completely forgotten the story
And mind, the game HAS the ability to do LAN play. They use it for their tournaments. Which means they consciously decided NOT to add LAN play to the finished game product.
WhaaaA?
like NINTENDO??
Yeah, um, that Kickstarter guy :P
11,01And I'm not talking about your boss.
PonyGirl_82: I HAVE been so MUCH refreshing but it's LimeV thats derping on my end
I loved SC1. Is 2 better?
hey there bronies!
hi KernelCobb
SC2 is better.
Hey KernelCobb.
The_4th_Wall that would be a great day
Roger
but yh, I'm still buying Mass Effect 3 when it comes out
Hi KernelCobb
too bad I had that shit yesterday, ended up having to reinstall my browser in the end
Ooo. What now o_o
after that, the question is... DO YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR GAMING FRIENDS?
I haven't put in well over 300 hours of my life NOT to know how this story will end
yes, i live with them :P
How is everyone doing today?
I have no friends.
11,01Activision is infamous for practically controlling their studios.
End? Silly otakon, they'll make another one
:)
hiya KernelCobb okay
Just to make you mad
11,01EA does it to a lesser degree.
Just Fine Kernel. Just Fine. How about you?
CriticKitten: this is the end of SHEPARDS story
And giving them a year to do the games they want
not a factor, unfoundbug
I'm doin great
i don't play online or xbox live or psn
thx for askin aircrafter
who is gonna stream?
Yes, and Halo Reach was the last Halo game.
I couldn't give a rats ass about the next game
hence why all the companies im in the middle of applying to do not deal with activision
No problem....I'm the boss.
gotta brb, feet need defrosting again >_<
The universe will still be there. Probably a spinoff
I want some Futurama :D
Oh, wait, whoops. No it wasn't. :D
CriticKitten: the end tot he story of the GUY i've been playing as
11,01Go indie.
Yearly releases are just quality destroyers
not some FUCKING prequel
or some FUCKING side story
My brothers game is Castle Crashers. That's a good indie game there.
Like I said.
yay LIMBO ftw!
They say NOW that it's the last one of this story.
i have an idea...he should stream the stream
Well this conversation has definetly went wacky.
or some FUCKING NO NAME FUCKING GRUNT THAT CAN'T EVEN FUCKING DUAL WEILD PISTOLS!
11,01That was pretty popular.
05,15Do you think our children will ever see Half Life 3?
But I wouldn't count on it.
maybe our grand children
This conversation's turned rather caustic.
life without online gaming will give birth to the only sitcom available on any channel
fluttercry eenope
no, we'd just see infinite loading bars
fluttercry they probably wont ever actually release it
FOR LIFE
soo PonyGirl_82 did you find anything to eat?
flutter_spin: their children's children's MAYBE
fluttercry: Gabe Newell can't count to three, so no
W00t some PF!
what am I looking at?
I had tinned peach slices mario_pony
it will never reach its hype
KernelCobb there is no eenope its nnope
dude, this guy rocks!
oh this
fillyfillyy yes, yes of course
silly me
what's Pink Floyd?
a band of some sort?
05a few ppl messaged me beign sad they missed this
oh the concert cool
On a serious note EP3 or HL3 will come out atleast in 10 years
you are about to find out
Pink Floyd is music with wacky taste
i take my Big Mac quotes seriously
05,15....I don't want to live on this planet anymore
11,01Maybe when the economy improves, we'll see some positive change.
11,01Maybe.
11,01I don't count on it.
fillyfillyy then i bet you loved the newest episode
11,01Because if something is profitable, why stop.
Better hope Amras isn't here otherwise we'll have neverending bitching
Nittany_Discord unlikely, there pushing too much into mobile and onlive gaming
05,15How can people NOT know what Pink Floyd is?
eeyup
fluttercry: you said that in Farnsworth voice
Nittany: Stick to indie games.
lol
Pink Floyd is odd. You can't help but love it, but you may still hate it.
fluttercry: ignorance, it's easy
11,01e.g. CoD Elite, CoD itself, Online Pasess.
11,01*passes
you know whats funny corn and p+orn sound soo much alike!
mfw I come back and Pink Floyd
And ArenaNet. They're cool.
Wrek
I love you.
Nittany_Discord IF the economy improves:P
11,01Sequelitis
11,01Definite IF.
05but yeah
ArenaNet had its up and downs with Guild Wars
AJ level of honesty here: I've never heard Pink Floyd
But EA, Activision/Blizzard, etc can go burn. :p
Dark Side of the Moon *cough*
05i promised shine on
05so here it is
Wrek: is this Shine on You Crazy Diamond?
05,15Sequelitis I love that series
COD will always keep being made
Nittany_Discord unlikely, current generation of gamers are.. not the greatest players
yep.
Are we on a acid trip or what?
Every year
@_@ Cause I'm seeing things....
its Pink Floyd. Go with it.
^
11,01Current generation of gamers are kids or sheep.
we are, it is groovy
11,01Most of them.
Agree
Pinkie Floyd...it must be done
leastways not being consciious it was Pink Floyd
05,15So many kids
Its like..Watching the earth being born...
Nittany_Discord: I'm technically a kid.
They cant tell quality from bile of trash
THAT is an acid trip.
Nittany_Discord: i am a kid but i take gaming very seriously.
hence why i tend to only play on PC now
makes me wanna go listen to some Tangerine Dream. Love that psychadelic shit
You would not believe what I see on the Bethesda forums. Everyone wants the old TES games made into Skyrim's graphics :[
custom servers = kicked kids = decent game enviroment
@_@ Its like watching the sun slowly expand and engulf the earth....but slowly....
11,01Forgive me for saying kids then.
I'm 22, fluttercry, thank you very much
Its...Its amazing...
Mom has the console, setup in the living room. I can't touch it without her watching me play
That would have been.... beautiful...
05,15to be honest though tgl1992 that would be kind of cool
PC... all mine
Well, I've got to go, cya tomorrow
05,15leave the gameplay intact though
imma go watch the new ep again
11,01But we still have the problem of gamers not knowing when to say no to games.
The_4th_wall if you really were, you wouldn't sa that
later Jim
Leave the classics be, I say...except Mario :D
bye Jim
bai Jim
mario 3d was kindof messed up
05,15I don't know, the REmake of resident evil was DAMN good
bai jim
they have a super mushroom if you fail hard
Jim is leaving? D:
yeah i hated mario3d
Never played Resident Evil
Nittany_Discord also not making their own decision on what a good game is
11,01Like Ubisoft PC games or CoD map packs (remember when people complained about the price but bought it anyway?).
fluttercry, the one on the Gamecube?
just going for whichever has the largest advertising budget
Yeah, I've got some work to do, and I'm getting too distracted by the chat ^^
I'd like the original resident evils too be remade in better graphics, but still corner shots.
05,15yeah, I loved that one
that one updated the voice acting...
Well to be fair Nittany, there are still plenty of truly good titles being made.
Nintendo -> Genesis -> PS. That was my order.
Flutterspin, Play ALL the games! Break ALL the ruls!
05,15but I missed the terrible voice acting
Or atleast give the players the choice of corner shots or over the hsoulder.
And made by major developers too.
shoulder*
it meant the voice acting was no longer so painful it was wonderful, but so okay it was average
11,01I won't buy from major publishers.
I can look down the list of PC exclusives and name several, actually.
yes, but anyone who thinks mw3 is a good game does not deserve the title of gamer
11,01I don't care if they make a great game.
05,15Stop! Don't open THAT door!
i'm surprised nintendo hasn't released a mini game remake of Donkey Kong...with the ladders and barrels and such
i love super mario bros 3
Just for this coming year of 2012 alone.
its just a mappack for 2 without your old save
Yet I still look back at old games. Anyone remember Starcontrol 2? I wonder..
11,01I just refuse to support their business practices.
Woah. That was close. You almost got turned into A JILL SANDWICH.
05,15Oh my Cod! It's Forrest, and it looks like he was killed by a crow!
Nittany: Then you refuse to encourage the GOOD publishers?
Which do still exist.
11,01I'll buy from them.
11,01I'm talking AAA ones.
Nittany_Discord: what do you think about nintendo?
dat sound= legit
nintendo tries too hard
11,01Dunno. They supported SOPA.
what about games like skyrim?
not my genre, but respectable
old stlye open world
11,01I own Skyrim.
skyrim was a great game. I consider it a milestone
hard reset?
I can relate. They pour big cash into products that don't look great in the end. Movie - Transformers
in the gaming community
game of the year in my books massivly under rated though
11,01Haven't bought Hard Reset, but did play the demo.
Microsoft AND Sony supported SOPA
Skyrim achieved the milestone that Oblivion failed to
05SHINE
05ON
game of the year in Game Informer as well unfoundbug
05YOU CRAAAAZY
05DIAMOND
11,01Microsoft opposed SOPA I think.
Nittany_Discord: what about games like mass effect 3? to my knowledge, bioware isnt on the most hated list
you shone like the suN!
Haha, I watched the Transformers movies. I really pissed my friend off when I correctly predicted the ending of the third movie.
11,01And PIPA.
I want a open world game like Minecraft but better. You start with a simple gun and a home. Your objective: Find people, survive, and thrive.
HA HARD RESET
shine on you CRAAAAAZY Tom
Anyone there? Man, I haven't been here in years...
11,01They are under EA.
lol
Minecraft is coming to le xbox.
11,01So they are banned.
like black holes in the sky!
My brother was an old fan of Tranformers. HATED them.
xbox minecraft won't be the same as pc minecraft
i'm not going to get it
hi
wait...minecraft is coming to xbox? since when?
....RANDOM WINDOW
05,15I remember when Neverwinter Nights was released. I fraking loved that game
and shiiiiiine!
I... still haven't played Minecraft
We were watching the movie and Optimus was getting whooped by some guy. So I leaned over and told my friend "I will bet you that Optimus defeats that guy later in the movie, all by himself." My friend was like "NOWAI".
I hope they give a discount too people that have the pc version.
Guess how the movie ended. :3
ingwaz announced at last year e3
I preferred its predecessor fluttercry.
Its been real empty here for the past month, dont think anyone knows this channel is still here
Baldur's Gate II.
11,01From gamer opinion, it seems that Bioware fell in quality under EA.
I hvent mined yet
05,15I had that too.
Off to watch Walking Dead, toodles everypony.
I certainly feel that way Nittany_Discord.
11,01Which I honestly predicted would happen.
oh well, i dont play minecraft personally, i'm not really in tot he sandbox games
Dragon Age annoyed me a great deal.
^^ Baldur's Gate. Good game, didn't care for it at the time.
Not because the game was THAT bad.
11,01I felt it.
eh
But because of the business policy around it.
well ofc, damn moneygrubbers
But still ME3 will most likely be the last great game they made
05,15Dragon Age was alright, Dragon Age 2 should be sent to the moon
ill be back in like 30 minutes ok im gonna go get some Scootachicken :D nom nom nom
I know it is... this place went dead a really, really long time ago. I wanted to see what was going on for the fun of it. :P If anyone still remembers me... I know Icy does...
skipping T^T
lol fluttercry. Agreed
make*
EVERY TIME I set up camp, there's that shithead at the edge of the place.
off to dinner, everypony, i'll be back later
dear god fillyfillyy
You do that FillyFillyy.
GIVE US A SEQUEL IN A YEAR! LIKE OUR MADDEN FRANCHISE!
NOMNOMNOMPIE
see ya KernelCobb
Wrek its skipping :C
awww yeah... come back to Pink Floyd
11,01I'm sure EA forced multiplayer into ME3.
"PLEASE save the keep of my forefathers!" "Okay" "Oh thank you hero! Just go to the shop and buy this DLC!" "FUCK OFF"
05,15Bioware said MP was always in the works
aircrafter my name isnt capitalized
also, HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY FUCKING A NEW MADDEN GAME EVERY FUCKING YEAR!
hi
HOW?
Well, if you want an example of how BIoware has slipped, Nittany....you need look no further than The Old Republic.
Lol. I know wht you mean Lasharus.
11,01Oh.
hiy moop
They still doing that? I thought... well last I heard they were still debating
haha so i didnt cap yours!
otakon, same way they do with fifa
Nittany_Discord: i've seen footage of the multiplayer, it looks pretty good actually, and as fluttercry said, they were wanting to do it from the beginning
CriticKitten: what? I heard that was enjoyable
people buy it
they sell it
05hows quality?
i just burnt my tonge with a hot cookie
I have origins, and I was like SO MUCH STUFF 8D and then dlcs....FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
otakon - because back when the series started, a new game meant updated rosters
05,15great quality Wrek
really bad on my end Wrek
Wrek: good, but a little stammering
otakon: It's good, but that's precisely the problem.
it's skipping and pausing tons
and we got suckered into the business model, and no one has screamed loud enough to change it
a new game in a series once everytwo years is STILL fast
yah
11,01Stream is fine for me.
Wrek: you got such awesome taste in music
nowadays
I swear too god this is a acid trip.
dat brass
Okay, enough ranting about games. I'm in a bad mood, and this isn't helping.
you could just DOWNLOAD roster updates
11,01Yeah.
05hah aircrafter
TOR is meant to be the successor to KOTOR, an excellent game. In that role, it falls flat on its face at the very first hurdle of the race.
otakon - not for Madden 98 you couldn't
but
05wait untill they play sorrow
Yeah my brother is in a group of 8 people. It takes them a good 3-4 years.
05NOW THAT is a trip
or 99, or 2000, or 2001 i believe
05,15so how bout this Pink Floyd?
Hey.
Wrek: are you streaming the whole thing or just Shine On?
12ohai
I very much enjoyed kotor
4There were a few others... but I forget them...
One was perfect
but I'm just getting started
4Heh...
I can't watch it if it's going to keep skipping :C
05well
05planned on the whole thing
2 was ok, I wish they made a third. They were planning it but they didnt.
4Do you remember me, Dari? ^^
Aircrafter: agreed, it was perfect, GREAT game
It boils down to being a refined WoW clone. A good game, but still very similar to WoW, and not at all the spiritual successor to KOTOR.
05cause it was requested by a few that missed it
Oh yeah, I do Malefor.
anyone playing anything interesting atm?
Xd
and now I'm getting MUCH lag
11,01I'll end that, in my opinion, the mainstream industry is too corrupted for my tastes. The only fix is either mass gamer boycotts (that stick) or a collapse.
XD*
it's unlistenable for me
Battlegrounds 2 was the best
12herpderp
4Awesome. I've changed over the past few years...
I swear too god 1 Had me addicted from day 1 too 30
Nittany_Discord: it'll be collapse first
If your not around here these days Malefor, where do you hang out?
^
http://derpy.me/pKhjR
Eh, I think it reflects how the economy is tanking too
11,01A collapse will recycle the industry.
As you can see, site's pretty dead now
11,01And break the oligopoly.
im still planning on getting ME3, even if its not on steam... i just hope they let me copy my steam saves if not i will be PISSED
Nittany_Discord: i agree that theres a lot wrong with the gaming industry, but some games are legitimately good
Aircrafter: I bought a friggin Xbox to play KotoR
and the corruption
Lol. thats good Masterbrony.
4Yep... I haven't been on here in years. I'm over at DarkSpyro now... been there for a while...
*ashamed* I never played KOTOR
do they have an irc channel?
C7 still turns up here too.
flutter_spin: go get it for PC NOW
Otakon: I spent my xbox days ( I started out gaming on a xbox ) Playing the first fable, Halo, And Kotor 1 and 2.
here
11,01Just gotta wait until people get bored of CoD and sick of EA and Ubisoft's bullshit.
i could never really get into KOTOR... and i love bioware games
I have a link
hold on
lol. Everyone says to play it, but I just don't want to.
KOTOR is one of the great star wars rpgs
/me downloads poster and heads to kinko's
A game that was as well done as KOTOR was should not be succeeded by a title like TOR. What amuses me most is that the game advertises itself using the Square Enix advertisement methodology: Show lots of flashy cutscenes and CGI that tells you NOTHING about the game and demonstrates zero gameplay whatsoever.
time for Astronomy Domine!
I'm afraid that wont happen Nittany_Discord
11,01And maybe Sony, but they are starting to flounder. The end.
I think RDX pretty much ran away because he was scared by all the pony lovers. :P
It is a legend that will always live in my heart as one of my favorites.
11,01You never know.
Oh God, Razz.
wow Nittany_Discord you are soooo SMART!!!!
I was doing good just going back and playing FFIV, FFV, FFVI
4Yep...
CriticKitten: agreed, thats part of what i like about bioshock infinity, the trailer they released not long ago was made from entirely in game footage
PINK
PINK EVERYWHERE
05i love this concert
And for bonus points, Bioware decided that TOR was worth an equal amount to WoW, because they are identically priced.
oh no, this is Learning to Fly...
YELLOW
Hey Wrek, How long is this video?
12Was Razz a noob? I wasn't here that long ago XD
That's hubris if ever I saw it.
huh, guess I'm remembering wrong
05this is a 3 hour acid trip
YELLOW EVERYWHERE
I think my modem hates this concert T^T It's skipping so much I cannot hear a bit of the song
Wrek: I know this is awesome
best concert ever, period
...and how far in are we >_>
^
11,01I might still be wrong mario_pony.
0515 minutes
we need to go deeper
OH GOD
xD
:D
....i need something too drink
Best part?
Razz was someone who drew Spyro art, she was pretty good, but she had a lot of 'followers' that pretty much idolised her on the forums.
11,01Honestly, my opinion is one-sided.
Aircrafter: Y U no like concert?! :|
Be right back my fellow Ponies
I dont not like it
At least Rift had the dignity to price itself lower than WoW.
I mean
11,01And you can thank Ubisoft and Sony for that.
I LOVE IT
And she took offense if you didn't LOVE her art.
I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS SHIT
TOR? nope.avi
Okay..
I'll be back later I can't listen to this whilst my modem is fucking up
The problem I have is that their songs are long. I don't like anything over 5 minutes.
12ah
Kicked.... =_= But I love it, its just long.
LIKE A BOSS
4I'm still friends with Razz. :P
flutter_spin: mfw ALL the sites I used to dl good old games no longer have Star Wars KotoR in their libraries
Very...Very Long.
im not going to play TOR... not until it becomes F2P, like it probably will
yes to both for me Wrek
11,01Sony shouldn't have the right to fucking take features from my console and limit it's activations under firmware updates.
Wrek: that would be awesome
Hah, is she any different? :P
/me considers starting acid for tis
/me doesn't like it when ponies don't have good taste in music
:|
Oh, don't worry about me. I, uh, have KOTOR. Just haven't played it
Wrek yes and yes
I swear too god THEY HAVE TOO MAKE KOTOR 3. JUST MAKE IT GOOD.
what starts with p and ends in orn?
13should play metallica and symphony some time
05also I hope you can forgive me headphone users
popcorn!!!
Shizuka!
05but the ending of this concert needs maximum volume
/me hugs Shizuka
Shizuka: please do
I'm thinking of getting one again, its 8 bucks at gamestop. and Its been a while since I played.
4Not really. :T I guess... she takes offense sometimes... still fan-crazy over Elora... :P
Aircrafter: KOTOR 3 is TOR... unfortunately
Wrek: NO PLEASE!
05dont know straight fro my head
Shizuka: I want you to know just how much I appreciate you telling me about S&M
Oh God. XD
05ill look it up
Wrek do it
I love that album so much
4Yep...
11,01Don't tell me you're going to hold up the stream for this entire thing. I love Pink Floyd, but I had plans for tonight.
No. Tor is not kotor. Its a embaressment. I will never relate it too kotor.
How old are you now anyway?
it's on FRIGGIN STEAM
lol air
my ears are already dying
/me adores Pink Floyd
i have headphones but still DO IT Wrek!!!!
Aircrafter: Sorry, it's not going to happen. TOR is the spiritual successor to KOTOR according to Bioware. Nevermind that the two games aren't really the same. Doesn't matter. Bioware won't make another KOTOR.
flutter_spin: http://store.steampowered.com/app/32370
Because they think TOR *is* KOTOR.
streams are like taxis, you wait hours for one, and 3 arrive at once
Playing ToR beta, I liked it. Then again, I never played KOTOR. Its.. odd
x3
there is where you can get KotoR
4Almost thirteen... 7th grade...
i love this but my ears will explode
Whut we wtachin >.>
05too bad this isnt livestream, that way i could max my own volume without disturbign the stream xD
true
Can't spell pornography without a phony
Hah, been a while...
flutter_spin: it was originally based off of the d20 ruleset modified for Star Wars
4Yeah...
that's why it feels weird
05I AM THE STUD IN STUPID
4I now have a girlfriend. :P My first...
I am the TWIT in Twitter
12IRL?
I put the I in team
Wait...
08,14I am ready.
KOTOR is on my list of games I've pasted that I may get back when games stop coming out. Bioshock is on that list too.
4Nope. :T
You cant spell R34 without kick
12ah
4I hope eventually...
not really, I don't use Twitter, fuck that noise if you excuse my language
Fallout 3 as well
05<3
what i really want... is another Armored Core game
12same thing if you ask me
Just so many games I've put on that list.
As for me, I was originally looking forward to a lot of games. Currently that list has been culled down to one. GW2.
flutter_spin: Fallout 1 and 2
12derp
I am the chef in FACEBOOK
XD I would get it on pc But I aint much of a pc gamer....
4People keep saying we're a good couple... :P
Ugh I hate Facebook and Twitter...
-.-
I am the terror, that FLAPS in the NIGHT!
Fallout 3 was good, I think it was a ok sequel too the first 2.
I hat Facebook, too
I am the goo on the bottom of the shoe of evil
I AM
Fallout 3 was the best imo
I've completed so many games, I guess I am burned out. I will play TOR with my bro in a couple months
not Darkwing Duck
05oh-tay.KHAN
I've never really been one for the whole online thing, not being able to be with them IRL kind of kills it for me, but if you're happy, that's cool.
yes Wrek?
Aircrafter: Fallout New Vegas is the real sequal to Fallout 2...
05finished your sentence for you
oh
lol
I was going to play TOR until they declared a Pay-To-Play model
lol
Then I stopped caring
i used to say facebook and twitter were for losers but yet i spend most of my time on bronystate
I am the bait in taliban
Ah, good.
4Yeah... we met over at a fan site for a different series...
Midnight_Tempest: Ya But it doesnt feel very fallout. But its explained why later in the story ( Spoliers Censored )
05i have been enjoying rift latley
CriticKitten: give it time, it'll become F2P
STO turned free. Space combat is fun, but that's it.
i'm here.
Game series?
wats STO?
05star trek online
Star Trek Online
lol, never noticed that dr
oh
05ninjad
XD Thedr, YOU ARE A BOSS.
otakon: By then, Guild Wars 2 will be out, and I'll have dedicated my existence to it.
lol
CriticKitten: nice
damn it
STO is pretty entertaining if you got someone to play with
I am looking forward to GW2
only 23 more days!~
shouting "ima firin mah lazer" never gets old
But I was also looking forward to Warhammer. That was sad.
didn't it wreck?
Midnight_Tempest: Ya, the lonely road one felt very much like fallout, dead money was close, and old world blues was just SQUEE
/me is possibly the only one looking foward to Twisted Metal this Tuesday
._.
4Nope... TV show...
05raise your hoof if you sidlike DLC that makes your game easier
Aircrafter: agreed
I am the 'fense' guarding defense
/me raises hoof
Hated Twiste Metal..
:P
Vigilante 8 <3
12which one?
05,15Why is everyone excited about Guild Wars 2 . What does everyone know that I don't?
um no
its a sequel
Aircrafter: yeah those were great, but Lonesome Road... that was the real fallout feel for me, it was great
fluttercry: I have no idea
to guild wars
At this point, GW2 will have to be a game completely unlike its demos to convince me that it's not worth pouring hours into.
it's funny i used to say twitter and facebook were for losers with no life yet i spend all my time on bronystate
....
I've been watching the vids of GW2. The combat looks sweet
damn it, the WAIT for ME3 is literally killing me
I like how they even created a semi-back story for the F:NV Main Character, and how about the guy who carried the old world on his back. That really pulled me in the first time.
fluttercry: It's an MMO that throws out some of the traditional formulas, so naturally people are hyped.
/me is the reason you can't see in the room
4You probably don't know it. You probably would make fun of me if I told you... Well... I mean... I AM a fan of Spyro... :P
sorry for interrupting your discussion but I have to ask what is on stream?
I CAN'T WAIT NEARLY TWO WEEKS!
And that video of everyone vs the black dragon :D
otakon: IKR?
ekips: Pink Floyd
05,15I shall look this game up
Dude, I watch MLP, I'm unlikely to make fun of whatever you watch. :P
otakon: the demo comes out on tuesday!
05currently on stream: Pink Floyd, PULSE: Live at Earls Court 1994
it DOES
SWEET!
fluttercry: Lemme save you the time, look here: http://www.guildwars2.com/en/
I just want to see the combos like if a mage casts fire shield, your hunter arrows turn into fire hunter arrows
thanks!
12Your talking about someone who likes MLP
12:'D
I can't WAIT
and guild wars is boring... like most MMO's
4Heh... It's a Nickelodeon show...
They have a lot of the details about the game on that page, or linked from it.
05but in GW2 you can JUMP
Guild Wars was good, but it was SHORT. Very short.
05JUMP!!!
4I watch MLP occassionally...
Wrek: Inorite
XD
teddy bear!
they added jumping
OMG
i can jump in real life too Wrek, doesnt make everything better...
Fallout 3 DLCS were good. I was actually afraid too do the pitt after the first time, I actually just went as far as the bridge and gave up.
next they will have running
Actually, I couldn't care less about jumping.
DAT BEAR
I played World of Warcraft. A guy decided to continue playing because THE SUN MOVES!
05he's epic on the steel guitar
12Spongebob? I love that show XD
I'm psyched for GW2 because it's a genuinely good looking game, that's really all there is to it.
what is it about MLP anyway? Isnt it some childish cartoon?
05,15I liked all the Fallout 3 DLC's except the Pitt and Mothership Zeta
4Nope. :P But we do love that show...
MLP is My Little Pony
4I'm talking about PoM...
ugh. Mothership Zeta
Much like how Skyrim looked good before it came out, and then it came out and surprise, it was actually good.
WoW is a waste of time and people that play it religiously should never be allowed to breed... im sorry if that is hateful but i LOATH WoW...
I don't know that abbreviation
My cousin couldn't stop talking about it
I liked the weapons, the story of it I didnt very much enjoy though.
What is on right now?
Aircrafter: the only thing I didn't like about FO 3 was the eventual "YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING PERFECT" when you hit max level with the right build...
oh wait, thats a GOOD thing
05currently on stream: Pink Floyd, PULSE: Live at Earls Court 1994
4Penguins of Madagascar... Heh... :T
Oh
Otakon: Lol.
12That show isn't childish p:
OK.
4Yeah... I know it isn't...
I'm pretty sure I've seen an episode of it before.
4Some people find it stupid, though...
so anypony have some weird disorder?
4I watch it all the time.
Ya. In the fallout games eventually you get too overpowering with killing everything in one shot.
autism
WoW was fine in the day. With anything I play, once you complete the content... move on
I laughed in the face of Super Mutant Behemoths.
bipolar
I am just looking forward to being able to play it. It's shiny, and being a kitty, shiny things are best things. :P
ADD
i can't stand dirtiness i start getting all itchie
otakon: Fallout 3 had such a small level cap though... i only had 3 skills at 100 when i finished the game...
I have a cronic fear of Spiders.
ditto
^ same
Midnight_Tempest: I did a high intelligence build and managed to max all skills but speech by 20
12You have nothing to worry about as long as it's not on PBS
Snakes are ok, I live in arizona, but spiders scare the -YAY- Out of me.
/me RUNS
Well, whatever you watch, you're still better than people who watch shit like 90210, The Only Way Is Essex, and Geordie Shore.
oh man. One day I rushed into a dungeon in Skyrim (which I never do) and a spider came on top of me. The only thing in Skyrim that scared me
05so much people!
10 Int + Skill Book Perk + Extra Skill Points Perk=maxed skills
what are we watching?
05currently on stream: Pink Floyd, PULSE: Live at Earls Court 1994
4Yeah...
We are waching a acid trip Ziltoidian.
Oh nice
And Midnight: Yeah, I'm growing tired of the original GW myself. I plan to complete enough of the Hall of Monuments to get all of the special bonus loot in GW2, and then stop.
flutter_spin: Isn't there a skyrim mod turning spiders in something else?
aCID
12no but really, I even like a few PBS shows :x
otakon: true... high intelligence made it easier to level your skills but they took that away in New Vegas which made that game much more interesting to me
ACID
flutter_spin: don't play Amalur then, they have HUGE spiders that dramatically pop out
4^Same...
I have no idea what PBS is.
Midnight_Tempest: eeyup
Wrek: Is there a CD of this particular performance?
Yes, there is a mod to turn spiders in wacky Spidermans
I'm in the UK. :P
4PBS is a kids channel dedicated to learning...
I am a pony...a little filly...an alicorn...and still the Moon Princess...yet I must request a brushie.
eh not all kids related
Because I like having lots of free GW SWAG to carry around with me as I play.
:p
I'd be more scared of a crazy spiderman running at me then a spider itself.
but yeah learning in general
4Most of the time...
otakon: though, when I hit level 50 i only had 1 skill that wasnt maxed... survival, cause i find it a useless skill
Like Fluttershy, I don't like to be scared :(
/me brushes Princess_Luna
Oh, shows like Dora the Explorer.
True that Midnight_Tempest
Thank you 4th wall...I will try not to break you from now on...
because being startled can be quite startling
Midnight_Tempest: yh, it's kind of useless
Speaking of which.
4No... :P
08,14Gut~
flutter_spin: swooping is bad?
I want one of these rigs in my room
/me brushes Princess_Luna's mane
4Shows like CyberChase...
Thank you...keep brushing...
Otakon: Alistair Reference?
1212PM-5PM Kids shows, 6PM-11AM other
/me keeps brushing
Oh, and fluttercry: I can find ya some YT links to the gameplay if you're interested. Best to look over that site I linked you first, though.
brushy brushy
Survival is only useful when you play the game on Hardcore mode... my god... so bloody hard...
yay~
oh, it's not a problem
05,15I'll do that, thanks CriticKitten
because LUNA
4Yeah...
I've always wanted too do hardcore but I chicken out all the time.
Midnight_Tempest - if you're talking about survival mode, i beg to differ
12it turns into KRWG when it's not playing kids shows
05still enjoyign the stream then Aircrafter?
4That's the only thing I can really watch when I'm home sick. :P
...let me rephrase that
I'll brb
if you're talking about Fallout new Vegas
hangon. My cat is acting up again
/me needs caffeine
Yes Wrek. I am very much enjoying the acid trip you call a stream.
12same thing though
Princess_Luna, is there something wrong with your mane, it needs an aweful lot of brushing
No problem! It's become pretty much the only game I've ever gotten so psyched about, so I'm happy to help explain to others why. :P
my brothers cat is named opalescence
lol
Zitoidian? ^ ^ it does...yay~brushietime!
MirrorImage: hardcore mode for Fallout New Vegas... its very hard when doing the DLC... dear god I died so often on Dead Money
Sorry, wrong pony!
IZZY! Stop! ... don't eat my legos!
Midnight_Tempest - well that's dead money; it's stupidly hard to begin with
especially with the collar
WIsh I had a brushable pony
>_<
Dead money scared me the first time I played it. Like the security armor though.
Even have my main planned out. :3
I am a pony...and brushable...
4Yeah...
Rocking out the Ranger, and I will totally get a kitty for a pet. Because, well, duh. :3
Vault 34 was difficult for me. Too much radiation.
/me brushes Princess_Luna some more
Aircrafter: When I finally played all the DLC for NV, I finally understood all the references that were in Fallout: Equestria
Brushies are so nice...thank you...
Midnight_Tempest - same
Midnight_Tempest: Lol. True. I still need too get into reading that.
I'm around. Ping me once there's movement.
It's fun to brush
Aircrafter - what you do is you bookmark the page and set aside an hour or 2 a day to read a chapter
He is still streaming
12I do wish PBS had some anime though
Its PonyKin...PONYBORN!
of course, being unemployeed helps, and i found myself giong through 4 or 5 chapters a day when i started
Because low battery.
I give up on finding a cure for the spell, I'm staying a filly for a while...even when it isn't fun...
/me loves to brush Princess_Luna
its epic and you will actually LOVE the characters Aircrafter... like you will literally feel sorry for them, it's so well writen
4I watch 4Kids for that...
/me loves being brushed
MirrorImage: Ya, Just alot too do...Like watch these streams @_@
I got into the first chapter and it seems nice already
Are we watching UFOs?
I don't really regularly watch any cartoons other than MLP.
ugh... that reminds me, Ive fallen behind on Fallout: Project Horizons... damn
Aircrafter - multitask; read the fic while watching the stream
Princess_Luna: I'm almost done just need to work on the wing and color it
No Red_Pegasus. We are on a acid trip too Hell.
Good!
yeah... Horizons has taken a turn for the silly the past 2 chapters, though it isn't entirely unwarranted
I will wait then!
12I watch Cartoon network, 4Kids, and some Adult swim
No need to yell..
Sorry...
all the old bronies might hate me for this, but this music is putting me to sleep
It's okay :)
Gonna read it for a bit right now. So no dinging my name please? Danks.
/me dings Aircrafter
But I thought THIS WAS YELLINGA! Whoops...
Kitty is out of food. Isabel wants more, but I have to buy more.
12oh, and the hub
/me is not old. 22 is a fine age
dont say anything more MirrorImage, the story needed some silly in it... it was getting more depressing than I like
Morty: I don't hate you I just don't agree with you that's all :)
/me is a filly, and loves being brushed
Yeah, I'm 26 and Mom still thinks I'm a kid
/me wishes he was older
I am a older brony
4The Hub is awesome... too bad it got removed from my catalog...
4>.>
/me is 27
27 and still awesome!
I'm 17 and I love really OLD music
/me brushes Princess_Luna
05im 18 and apparently considered old :|
/me is 14
well technically, you can't disagree with the fact that this music is putting me to sleep
yay~...
Wrek: I never knew that
because it is
03gahhhhhhhhh
I'm 14, and I mostly listen to Classic rock
well...
wow im older than you wrek
So many young fillies :D
probably not mostly actually
I still don't know what to do with my life, heh.
mfw I'm older than Wrek. xD 24 here.
what si the stream?
ScootaChicken: me too
05my dad practically born n' raised me on queen, pink floyd, dire straits and so on
ScootaChicken! How's noms
hey Wrek, when was it your birthday?
?
12indeed
i also love old school mario games
0519th july
Wrek: Your dad is awesome
why do people keep tracking my COMPLETED story?
hmm
The_4th_Wall: noms
05,15Wrek my dad did the same thing
/me is over 1000, enough said.
otakon and I seem to be the oldest here... unless Kencolt is around :D
yh
my parents don't know jack shit about music :(
or Sumica Midnight_Tempest
that's sad
And aging gracefully.
ScootaChicken: it is
You know the first time I went to get a job? August 2008 when I 23. Right when the market crashed.
sad
I'm going too give a forecast of the story, eventually the main pony is going too be kicked out of , or escape the vault/whatever its called.
yikes
ScootaChicken this should explain it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuRwis3_iVk
arrrrg
Am I right?
Aircrafter: what story? Fallout Equestria?
12And if I want to watch a particular show, I go on youtube and watch some pirated videos :D
Ya
I love this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDuG95DXbw8
otakon: what is?
to be honest, I'm 17 but I enjoy older stuff more the newer stuff
and i;m back
/me brushes Princess_Luna's mane slowly
Aircrafter: they're called Stables
/me just got home from his eight hour road trip... bleh
Aircrafter: well it IS a Fallout style novella
emangamer: hiya!
gannon beat me
hey emangamer
/me murmuring, falling asleep
ohai emangamer
Ah. They are then. CONTINUING
HNNNNNNG
/me brushes Princess_Luna's tail
hi Phase4
I come into the State, and you're playing Pink Floyd's Pulse. I love you all.
Then again, my best fried was kicked out of the house at 18. Lived in his car for a good year before getting a job.
hi diddutz
DerpyHooves`: sorry I missed your stream :'(
/me twitches and falls asleep*
05currently on stream: Pink Floyd, PULSE: Live at Earls Court 1994
Aircrafter: it's 2000+ pages, 49 chapters and over 600K words, it's good
too much lag :'(
I'm sure.
12awesome
not on my end for once
its' weird
good is an understatment otakon
Ohai Wrek
The "When I'm x" videos are pretty awesome too
Still good here.
Midnight_Tempest: indee

streans till broken here :'
Aw. Reminds me of Sting.
:'(
ScootaChicken: no, I meant your parents knowing NOTHING of good music
Quick question...Does youtube have a page where you can look up which video were previously deleted from your fav list?
4Heh... I loved Hub for the Haunting Hour. ^^
Forget that empty space qX
Cypresswolf: eenope, try checking your history
Aircrafter: When you do finish Fallout Equestria, read Fallout Project Horizons and Fallout Pink Eyes... those are both really epic too
ctrl H?
mmk.
actually otakon, I wouldn't say nothing, my dad did introduce me to classical music, which I really like
O_O Them I just lost an entire page of videos :|
ah
08,14Be right back. .
05prepare for lasershow
but none of them know anything about rock, which I mostly listen to these days
08,14Will it be anytime soon? I am getting a bit tired. . .
prepare for Flim And Flam
ctrl+shift+h
ScootaChicken go to bed then get out of it then get under it and sleep.
they are FIRIN THEIR LAZERS!
Aircrafter: Pink Eyes is a little...... well OUT there even for Ponies and Fallout if you ask me though
I will not read FO: E simply because that genre can get very cliche (not saying it is, I've never read it) and the sheer length of the fiction...
DWR_Drawing: but I don't want to go under my bed, ehren is there
Then, we go back in time where everypony died.
Heheh
That isn't ehren ScootaChicken <_< >_>
otakon: but it was still fun to read
I don't like reading, so I avoid the stories
DWR_Drawing: who is it then?
12for.. 1 hour :D
I am immune to thy sezuires.
Princess_Luna: we, let me put it this way, it kept me coming back till it was finished and I am notoriously finicky when it comes to good reading material.
and it was a good and bad thing it ended
ScootaChicken How the hell do I know? I'm just a guy under your bed...I mean, I am your bed <_< >_>
What is the worst Pink Floyd album?
Cherchez la Filly XD
TwoTone: there ARE none
I'd watch it looped for an hour.
DWR_Drawing: O_o
03tk.
Aircrafter: it gets better
The only ones I really know are Dark Side of the Moon
oscillating lights? BITCHPLZ
wait a second DWR_Drawing... are you the voice inside my head I refuse to hear?
I figured as much, but the only long running fic I have followed is Progress...well there are a couple others, but oh well...
I am not a fan of The Final Cut
She had feelings with the female filly singer...
Oh god This is getting good already
flutter_spin: That sounds like Luna's music.
05hows that for trippy Aircrafter ;3
O_O
Aircrafter: eeyup, just keep reading
Its...Like....PREETTTTTY./...
needs moar ACID!
hey guys, I've been debating something
What? I haven't made music...
I'm tripping baws @_@
Should I torrent System Shock 2?
Need No Education, Brick Wall
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwdqtGqcOD8&feature=related
>Progress= yay
Do I...have a theme song?!
I feel like im on LSD.
ScootaChicken You know it. Remember I AM a figment of your mental illness...
as is everyone else on BronyState, amirite DWR_Drawing?
otakon: what do you mean torrent SS2? you mean dl it or... what?
Ahahaha, Derpy.
ScootaChicken Nope, just me.
sadly, I have never been to a concert
I'm gonna turn on some fallout music too this Stor.
story*
hey Princess_Luna have you red Bubbles fanfic?
Getin the mood.
4Heh...
omg, crazyfrog is on damn vevo
/me wants to see TSO someday
*read
?...no...
Now for the opposite question, what is the best Pink Floyd (you can't say DSOTM or The Wall)?
What is TSO?
crazy frog is a sex offender is every state
Trans Siberian Orchestra
OH. What is bubbles?
uh, I don't know. Its on my todo list. I haven't listened to all of Pink Floyd
TwoTone: Obscured by Clouds
Midnight_Tempest: you KNOW what I mean "nudge, nudge, wink, wink"
i return for a breif second
Princess_Luna: a really sad derpy fan fic.
ohh shiny
im back
Princess_Luna: Do you have your cutie mark?
Oh...I may have heard of it...I have read MLD...*sniff*...
I have my cutie mark, yes.
otakon: actually no... i dont... my mind isn't working at peak efficiency right now :$
Kk
argh
Time to draw that
Midnight_Tempest: pirate bay
Good, please do draw it...
05i love how the lasers portay a cloudy sky in them
Princess Luna's cutie mark is the best. It makes her have the best nickname. Splotchbutt!
No, I don't have my cutie mark. I went to college for computers, working at a restaurant, good at nearly everything, yet no idea what kind of "career" to have
Ha ha!
otakon: i see... do eeeet... i torrent stuff every day
anyone else?
Princess_Luna: Oh man you're gonna love this god damn drawing I swear :D
I'll repeat the question
TwoTone: my favourite is either Wish You Were Here or Pipers athe Gates of Dawn
OK...can I see it yet?!
Should I torrent System Shock 2?
Princess_Luna: wana read it?
05you should buy it of steam
Read what?
Splotchbutt is worst princess. Prettywings is best prciness.
Nope :3 Just a few more thingys
otakon you could probably get it somewhere else
05its good enough to deserve that
well maybe
This video has always made me laugh, though RIP headphone users for sure: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgpsZNsU_iY
I also took 5 years of band.
/me now haz dinner 'how iz everypony?'
and torrents are more dangerous than filehosters
Princess_Luna: Bubbles
I was a flea market and picked up a special edition copy of Pipers at the gates of dawn.
Princess_Luna Personally, I only torrent games that 1) I have previously purchased but lost or 2) Older than 2003
05,15I don't think it's on Steam
at a*
I will read it, depending on the length...
system shock 2 isnt on steam... i wish it was
But I'll do whatever anyone tells me to do. Right now no one is leading.
well that's the thing
Princess_Luna: It's very short
I can't find a direct dl version
Princess_Luna: it's about a page long.
I have bubbles on mah Kindle but I havent read it yet. :3
I will read it at some point then. A oneshot I take it?
I also Have My little Time Lord. It is truly epuc
otakon: torrent it... pirate bay is where i find all of my games and music mostly, and i havent had any problems
12lmao
Gentlemen
Cant wait for MLP next episode

SCIENCE B*TCHES
11,01So, how about 'dem black holes?
what are we watching?
Wait a second. I know him from somewhere
Why so the holes have to be black?
P.U.L.S.E
05Currently on stream: Pink Floyd, PULSE: Live at Earls Court 1994
I know the song from this video, but I can't for the life of me remember where it's from: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnOrDKjTwQ
ah thx
Yeah... connection... :T
hey!
they are not black
Eh...Its interesting so fart.
...
Deadmau5 was the first techno artist to sell out Earls Court
Far*
?
11,01Black holes are black.
we just can't see the radiation they emit
Why can't they be asian, Nittany?
Might read a little more later.
Yeah?
11,01Lol.
that's racists
Nittany_Discord: technicaln not, theyre just don't emmit light ...
11,01No, they suck light up.
Not that long ago he came and idled on the channel
Weird that I like Star Trek, but hate hearing scientists fight over theoretical science
11,01They emit energy around them.
They cause the very light to BEND
black holes emit stuffs
11,01Not directly from them.
not black holes; singularities
Princess_Luna: heres the right one sorry for the mistake https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgkrBTryVCfmAARA5ZCMTY4nTa2ta2-mhmdpxvipEoA/edit?hl=en&pli=1#
But something like a week ago it was unregistered (whether by mistake or intentionally I don't know) and I haven't seen him since
Heh... so he gave up on the site?
11,01Anything can't come out from the event horizon.
TwoTone, lots of stuff bends light
Site's still up
11,01Gravity bends light.
11,01The sun and Earth do it.
Well, yeah... but it's inactive.... :T
That's what I said
Magnetism Bends Light
He said he was going to keep it up forever, and sticks by that.
Stuff happens in space. There.
^
aliens did it
wubwubwubwuwbwubwuwbwubwubwubwuwb
ancient aliens did it
I'm more of a biologist anyway. . . .
Suddenly; DARKMATTER
11,01That would make sense Jaketehsnake since light is an electromagnetic wave (or photon with a spin).
05pink floyd, origin of wub
He is eating that Mic
The first to step dub?
nomnomnom
11,01Tasty.
AUDIONOM
05,15Freaking black holes how do they work?
11,01I got to get back to cleaning.
13black holes suck
Dohohoho
F***ing Magnets, How do they Work~
11,01fluttercry: Seriously, no-one knows for certain.
fluttercry gravity
Black holes don't really suck.
11,01Jaketehsnake: Look up electromagnetic theory.
RawketLawnchair there is actually no such thing as a sucking force in nature
Okay, I'll read it inbetween my 8th Grade classes XD
I'm back, I just got the link. Sorry for not declaring my sudden dissappearance...
Hey, you know what sucks? Vaccums.
Hey, you know what sucks in a metaphorical sense? Black Holes.
Jaketehsnake, it's never too early
Take white construction paper>cutout hole> place over black cunstruction paper
Hey, you know what isn't cool? Lava.
BLACK HOLE
05sun
like my old hair...it was space...
Heh... he must be really self-confident... :P

05they played untill the moon eclipsed
wow
how long is that list?
I call shenanigans

((I don't know, but I need sleep))
NinJa Otakon..
otakon: a fortnight is 2 weeks...they played OVER a fortnight
oh
053 hours a night, 14 nights
*currently looking at MLP t-shirts* hmm.

05give or take
for some reason I thought a fortnight was 40 days
hmmm
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzagwenhTZ1r6mvxlo1_500.png
05they recorded on the final play iirc

05what better way to end the dark side of the moon concert, with an eclipse?
We only do the pony action when the new episode is on
wb KernelCobb
/me eats shroom
thankyou otakon
hi KernelCobb
So Sat 10am
mario_pony: you have no shrooms
helloo :)
Wrek: agreed
0,14the only way better
have you been on selna gomez twitter
wait there will only be 13 eps in season 3!!!! WTF :(
also, mfw all the pony eps up till now are 15 hours long
0,14is with the actual moon right there
any pony got info on that?
TheDr: there's no confirmation on that.
TheDr: at first! it's 13 CONFIRMED eps
05^
saxypretender yea if they had timed it right before an eclipse...amazing
wait
theres NO confirmation it's only 13 eps?
wait ...
OHHH! i thought only 13 eps at all. :$ srry i thought it was like the last season
or theres no confirmation its' 13 eps
all we have right now is some texts from somebody who claims to work on the show.
yeah
/me plays with moustache
take it with a grain of salt and all that such
There's been no official word from Studio B or Hasbro on the matter, and it's been months since that rumor came out.
what is this rumor concerning?
this guys really good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
damn, I'm suddenly tired as buck
i haven't heard of it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_episodes
dankes TheDr
it sez there are 13 s3 eps
KernelCobb: it was a claim that S3 will only be 13 eps
TheDr: spoiler?
np
05ok guys
05shows over
MUST
HAVE
http://bit.ly/wj2Q5P

08,14~yay~
well go!
you go, you go!
Aircrafter I love that series, I am only on chapeter 23 But It is AMAZING
Jaketehsnake: there is a reason it's 775 dollars
the wiki page says S3 will have AT LEAST 13 eps, not only 13
11,01Obligatory encore.
i love EQD i check it ALOT!
Aircrafter: spoilers!
Just got too chapter 5 JakeTehSnake XD
Nittany_Discord: ofc
Sorry....Otakon... :P
damn is he done
ok nvm srry :$ i got my tail in a not of nothing :$
who is streaming? i wish to brohoof them
Aircrafter: no really, its okay but spoilers of any kind are a bannable offense
/me readies $1500 to secure that plush
are you watching the grammies
<_>
*sigh* none of these shirts do me.
Just pm me when he joins
Listen guys: There has been NO reputable announcements on the length or content of Season 3. Could be 13 eps. Could be 26. Could be 4 TV movies. Could be just 10 straight hours of Rarity and FLuttershy giving the audience increasingly amorous looks. We have NO confirmation on any of this.
6w9
it's not IN THE OFFICIAL RULES PAGE YET THOUGH, HINT HINT!
05 /)
LOL
it's Wrek
L. GaGa looks weird
RAWRity i would be perfectly okay with ANY of those options
RAWRity: mfw it's the last one
http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=533 is probably the only one I like.
Aircrafter You are in for an Amazing treat. So much Adventure. Happy, Sad, A bit of romance in there too :3
rawrity: i hope not that lol
05ACOUSTIC
05FTW
/me drinks lukewarm Budweiser
Why do people think that Luna was banished on the moon. Episode 1 clearly says IN the moon and when Nightmare Moon was free the face in the moon dissappeared. So it's not like she was up there dancing on the moon for 1000 years.
/me grabs a lighter and starts waving it in the year.
emangamer: it's only a joke
Aircrafter I have every chapter on my kindle. It makes Fanfics so easy yo read.
emangamer: bc it's funny
Mlp Romance?
Shipping Man...
It is just another silly joke
Aircrafter: you'll see
I'm into that stuff.
/me actually gets out his zippo. I have pics
lol
well got to go everypony once more srry about getting anyone in a work :$ i bet season 3 is all fine :$ see yall later
this dudes really good
why don't we have an accoustic pony?
bye TheDr come back soon!
who is e
accoustic playing pony*
I like the audio books.
/me I dont smoke But I have a zippo :3
one developed for hooves of course
Easier too read.
KernelCobb: there's AcousticBrony on Youtube
I mean in the show itslef
a cannon
i will be on agian in a few hourse :)
oh good point
Aircrafter Is the narrarator any good?
I never liked the whole pony&pony romance thrown in everywhere either. Just something people do I guess.
/me is not intentionly spelling things wrong :(
hes a guy
But ya
He narrates better than most people would.
Aircrafter: eeyup
personally, I think it'd be a good end to the show as a whole if we got a 13 ep Season, and then a TV movie to act as a capstone to the whole hurrah.
otakon: there's also me...
i think this dude is a damn good singer:D
MLP FiM full length movie....all of my money...
0,14I like that idea, RAWRity
ScootaChicken: oh yeah, sorry I forgot about you ScootaChicken
dem grammys?
If anything, just show them in 2parts like the season openers
^
Those 4 episodes alone are in my top 10
RAWRity an end? blasphemy
I still say Season 2 operner should have been a three parter
i agree with unfoundbug...it must never end
no where near enough luna yet
Aircrafter, I dont know how I feel about narrators, when I am reading, I might accidentaly skip over information, but I dont like it to take forever to read
guys lets face it
when it is about to end, we must take over
it WILL end one day
and continue it
I agree otakon Season two premeire was a bit rushed
Hi everypony.
No it needs to end sometime
Know what ya mean Jaketehsnake
but it's the memories we keep from it that will last
unfoundbug: I would rather the show be only 3-4 Good seasons, then have it overstay its welcome and degrade *cough* Simpsons *cough*
hiya Red_Pegasus wb
if they end g4 ponies, sometime later they will come out with g5 ponies
is this finally over
for the toys
The problem I face is that each episode is treated as a stand-alone episode. There is no progression between the episodes (or very little to notice)
RAWRity: you do know The Simpsons is still funny, right?
otakon: haha no
otakon good point
no its not
flutter_spin: there is continutiny
05im already workign on g5 ones xD
just not TONS of it
its lost its appeal ever since the movie
king of the hill lasted a VERY long time
when quantity>quality is when I sue Hasbro for all money they've ever made off me
Simpsons has been going on twice as long as it ever should have.
Wrek: you and you lanky G5 style
O Wrek u so silly :3
Aircrafter What I think I'll do Is read the whole series not know what will happen, Enjoy it and have it be epic. Then I will listen to the whole series through again on auidobook :D
Like the Luna episode... everyone was freaking out except Twilight. Seriously? Twilight was the only sane one?
inb4 all of Wrek's ponies end up looking like Slendermane
Well thats gonna take awhile then Jaketehsnake.
is going to be over anytime soon
KernelCobb: i never really got king of the hill was it supposed to be funny or hat?
g5 ponies will be EVEN SLIMMER and have even PONTIER noses
05my DA is proof of that KernelCobb
mario_pony people liked it for its realistic humor, making fun of real life things
G5 Ponies will only be stick figures with highly detailed manes
link it to me wrek
oh otakon. Did shy ever finish any other parts of her fic?
indeed
King of the Hill had some humor, but it was out in left field
Aircrafter, I don't care! I LEIK FANFICTION! also, this one seems different, very well written,. There were a few plot twists that just slapped me in the face
emangamer: I don't think so
Shy is writing a fic?
yh
I mean listening too it on the audiobook...He dont read that fast.
for shame...it had potential
that's news to me actually
05drunk
Jaketehsnake: what fic are you talking about?
/me is drinking his second Budweiser now....
Fallout Equestria
did anypony read Pegasister16's fanfic?
enope
I did...
interesting concept
/me is now watching wrek
As a HUGE fan of the fallout series, it really hit home with me
I didn't even know she had one
mario_pony: she is a nice pony...
wrek i wouldn't consider those g5, just differently drawn g4
Jaketehsnake: agreed, same here
0,14ahh, my favorite Pink FLoyd song
05KernelCobb, its an inside joke really
lol
yh
besides, who knows, it's possible g5 may end up looking like g2.....
inside joke
/me shudder
emangamer: well im sure she might continue it. dont expect her to come out with a part two so fast
yeah it was about dashie comming to real world and meeting chuckie.
like LEVERAGE
um
wrek oh i see, i never get those
which Chuckie?
we would have to really piss hasbro off for that to happen
05and now
otakon: the evil killer doll one
05solo!
0,14say, Wrek, do they play Money in this concert? If so, did I miss it already?
"Me and Casey. We used to get drunk before we did the dishes. Me and Casey would get high and listen to our boredom.
otakon the evil possesed doll
"
emangamer: oh god why?
aircrafter Do not lose faith. At a few pooints it may be a bit slow but trust me, It gets better
Did anyone notice the building designs in Hearts & Hooves. Those were some insane details
05you missed it SaxyPretender
0,14darn
otakon: she is a large chucky fan
0,14but imokwiththissolo
once again, yikes
hey
Question: What band/musician do you feel is criminally overrated?
did anyone notice the pairing of Derpy and Doctor Whooves in Hearts and Hooves?
I HATE Child's Play overall
KernelCobb: eeyup
I did
;)
No, not even the first 3 times.
lol
lol flutter_spin
i want to go to bed so bad but me and my dad are going hunting in 7 minutes
yikes
EQD had to show it before I noticed
otakon: those movies scared the s**t outa me as a child.
Huzzah! It's finished!
:)
I DID notice Dr. Hooves splashing the second time
/me Find's Child's Play too ridiculous to be scared.
have you ever seen the corn children
TOY_PON3|Drawing: SHOW US!
same scene as derpy and doctor whooves...bon bon appeares twice..in the same position...lazy animating
SCARY
hold on i need to take a picture.
05dat ceilign thing!
otakon you're right the last ones were just funny not scary
I'm surprised EQD didn't know why there was a dunce hat. Sheesh, come on!
/me takes asprin and drinks a whole bottle of water in one drink
MASSIVE BALL ACTION
There..
wrek that's the portal to equestria
KernelCobb: more like animating on a budget of chewing gum and pocket lint.
05aye
RAWRity: I know! They need more funding
They aren't gonna get it though.
screw health care, give hasbro money!
Scratch Shortcake from hub then
I dreamed I went through a portal to Equestria. The rest was, well, its a long story.
05you kinda brought that upon youself if you actually thought it was a good idea to watch a movie named doll tits
flutter_spin i'm jealous
Hasbro's entire business plan is about keeping the advertising (aka The Show) cheap as hell so they can optimize profits from the toy sales.
otakon you payed to see doll tits did you not know about the internet back then?
I think we have all had those dreams flutter_spin. They are awesome byond words
look at this pic! i dawwwwwwwwwwwwd

mario_pony: I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GETTING DOLL tata's!
RAWRity at least their toys are getting less and less lazy. they made celestia white finally for example
now all we need is an applejack with a correclty colored hat
otakon i know i'm just kidding.
At least they are giving me another chance at McD toys!
FINALLY
KernelCobb: just took em over a year.
thats all folks
RAWRity: yea, JUST a whole friggin year
05and now for the best part in this entire concert
05crank it up
can't wait
05cause we are lifting roofs!
strong
0,14Not my roof!
I get the feeling wou went to this concert Wrek
0,14I need that to protect me from the old!
0,14*Cold
So, I checked my wal-mart for blind bags today. They DID have a box of Mystery figurines in the MLP section...but it was for something called "la La loopy" or some shit.
i feel a draft
...I feel silly...why is everything so big...
RAWRity i believe blind bags are toys r us exclusive
McDonalds will be my ticket. Just one month
This is a little creepeh.

KernelCobb: eenope, they're in wal-marts, just being very slowly stocked

unfoundbug: well, if it makes them money...plus it's not like Zynga is gonna be around in a couple more years.

KernelCobb: what makes you say they're higher quality?
My soul belongs to SB64
So for any of you who clicked on my link did you like my drawing?
RawkettLawnChair, Have you seen PMV Hallejah? That one will make you cry faster
I think it was perfecto Toy_Pon3
i loved it!!
RAWRity the blind bag figurines have all the same pose. EX: RD's and fluttershy's
TOY_PON3|Drawing i got DCd will you send me the link i never saw it

Cypresswolf: PMV's are stupid. You're stupid.
i gotta refresh brb
alas for all the mods have gone quiet
/me wishes she had a portal gun from when she went to Aperture science
ALL THE MODS!
People have said that the new McDonalds toys are the "closest" to the series
But the toys in the blindbags seem good too
Hipster is my favorite mod
*rasberries in Rawketts direction* :P
flutter_spin my point exaclty
KernelCobb: but McD only has 8 models. Blind Bags have more characters they have to cover (plus they ARE getting more diverse. wave 3 Blind Bags include Big Mac)
Speaking of Aperture Science. . .http://i41.tinypic.com/jq6tl2.png

Essentially, McDs has a smaller number of toys to produce, for a shorter amount of time, since the toys are only available for about 3 weeks. Hasbro is producing many, many more, and doing it year-round.

dang it. I had the song Its a Barbie Girl from Aqua in my head
But since we all know that equestria is Earth in a couple thousand years (here being my proff http://derpy.me/Y-mmP) also if you think that if its song long in the future why is the tire still around? Tires dont fall apart in fact thay will last millions of years. Also It must be the same planet because there are ponies, One sun one moon, Similar atmosphere, they have books and other similar technological advances. Twilight Point

if you've gotten nominated for a Grammy, it's BECAUSE you've had a huge amount of hits over the past year, if not longer.

10,02Something is seriously wrong with my computer, I need to restart it, sorry, brb
note: try play-dough ice cream at one point in life

Oh, I certainly like 21, but Born This Way was an album that I can listen to a dozen times and still love, while 21 wore out its welcome pretty fast.

Midnight_Tempest: i'm not kidding

mario_pony: yes. Just 1 TV in the household. What's so hard to believe?
Oh, yeah. Deadmau5 tweeted he was debuting a couple of heads

/me prefers Skrillex over Dead Mau5

RAWRity: how many people live with you?
/me prefers neither.
mario_pony: right now? me and my mom.
Not my cup of tea.
LadyCanary: You don't like Dubstep? Or just them?

I didnt think it sounded very good at all, Saxy.
0,14yeah =/
mario_pony: no, but my mom does generally have a lot of company over. And they LOVE to watch fucking Big Bang Theory.

Phase4: O RLY?
ave grohl and paul mccartney... damn
TOY_PON3 The_4th_Wall I hate how it tauts itself as some representation of geek culture when in truth it's just a rehash of every single joke about nerds and geeks that's been played out.
The loooove you taaaaake
MahBoi777: its not unfunny but i just cant enjoy it with the laughing track
knock knock knock Penny
Bon Iver won a Grammy?
RAWRity: You have a GRAND point...
As some have said before: The Big Bang Theory is Nerd Blackface.
Dave Grohl's probably like: THIS IS THE BEST THING EVAR
That's exactly what I <3, RAWRity
RAWRity: Damn that's pretty blunt
Phase4:true, those people do laugh maniacally
why did I click that
A friend of mine calls BBT "Uncle Geeky's Ol' Time Minstrel Show"

LadyCanary: Who's your favorite Titan?
Hm..

Mine's Raven
Aqualad.
<_< >_> you know something I dont regret at all... giving up Television... best choice I ever made

Midnight_Tempest: why?
oh, i was confused
LadyCanary: IKR?
Favorite Titan: Cyborg Favorite Villain: control freak, lol
Favorite Teen Titan?
TINKY WINKY
I like Raven but only because she's a badass
My favorite villian? MAD MOD my duckies.
^
Ohai SB
YES
F-CK YEA
mario_pony: because there is nothing but reality shows and other crap like that... i haven't watched TV in almost 6 years
Mad Mod is boss
Mad Mod was pretty good. THough I really do think Slade was the best villain.
Bah, I'm missing a Teen Titans discussion
Slade
0,14Deathstroke by another name
Midnight_Tempest: ya t.v. nowaday sucks
Ah Slade Wilson.
scout ina tophat
also, So glad they didn't ever bring up Identity Crisis in Teen Titans
I hate Terra...just saying
TopHat: your on his head
0,14...oh man
only show i watch noe is regular show
You know, it would've been really interesting to have Deathstrokes daughter, Ravager into the show.
0,14Identity Crisis >.<
*now
yfw the Terra episode is on now.
I didn't like Terra either
It's finally dissolving my toes. My cell MUST be known to somepony else
LadyCanary: Which one?
First one.
LadyCanary: there are several Terra episodes.
Shit..
she's a traitor
^
The first one where you see her.
...makes me glad I'm not her.
She pissed me off at times. And POOR BEAST BOY. YOU BITCH
whats with the voice
Midnight_Tempest: never watched it wat's it about?
Terra: DOHOHOHOHO
lol
Bitch Terra
dat music
I liked Terra's character for what it was. Though that final episode with her was kinda...weird.
I wanted to hug poor Beast Boy...</3
:(
Beast Boy is forever alone
That's fucked up...

13i am not going anywhere .-.
lol
LOL
oh, its lc that left
nvm then, hi Shizuka
mario_pony: its usually on fridays on NBC around... 7 pm MST i think
/me wubs Shizuka.
0,14see, RAWRity, that's why I don't have my ex on my FB anymore
0,14out of sight
13<3
0,14out of mind
Shizuka:
Put up a stream.
my alter ego is calmer than a sleeping kitten.
I feel dat SaxyPretender.
13but..
13.-.
Midnight_Tempest: cool i'll make sure to watch it.
Okay not sure if I should watch Grammys or Young Frakenstein?
Young Frankenstein :3
0,14Young Frankenstein
^^
Do it, Shizuka
Thanks ^^
SaxyPretender: Problem with that: we're still friends for the most part, but she...has some rather severe psychological issues.
13but... it's SB time..
mario_pony: i think you can watch the previous episodes on the NBC website... you should check there first
0,14ah
0,14gotcha
13at least i think .-.
MEANWHILE, I'm developing kidney stones cause noone wants to shoot my cell random texts
Guys, got a dilemma here.
Midnight_Tempest: will do
Amber hasn't rang all day
i meen Private614
lets not demand anything of Shizuka... we dont have the right to demand anything of the mods
so occasionally she can get into a rather unstable mood. and that's when I get 4 am phone calls about suicide.\
My ex was...whiny to say the least. A real Debbie Downer.
what's the problem Private614?
Isnt that a bit unsettling for you RAWRity?
/me glomps Midnight_Tempest
/me is glomped :$
Which should I watch first of Doctor Who, the old season(1st-7th) or the new season(8th-11th)?
My ex was a bitch :)
hmmm
LadyCanary: Kinda gotten used to it after 4 years, tbh. I just have to talk her down, remind her that whatever's going on, she'll get through it, and remind her to take her medication.
Is all of it an option?
old or new doctor?
Got it down to checklist practically.
New doctor.
RAWRity: Gotcha.
new maybe?
/me glomps his left foot violently
new doctor
0,14New Doctor
The 8th to 11th.
0,14you get to tennant faster
/me noms on kirzstryfe
Ok, sarge.
/me is best doctor.
/me is now bleeding profusely
hello Placebo
Hey Placebo! Nice to see you!
also, New season is on 9-11.
Ohai LadyCanary, MahBoi777 , everyone.
Placebo darling!
More impirtantly, you get to Matt Smith faster
<3
8 only had the TV Movie in the mid 90's
TOY_PON3: <3
0,14haha, GabeofThrones
Oh, I thought it started with 8th.
oh gawd, this again
Silly me.
xD
dari's favorite doctor is Matt Smith
inb4 dari rage.
Oh man this chat is gonna get gay <3
lol
GabeofThrones...WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
make sure you tell him how much you love Smith
:D
nah, 8 is the one most don't like to talk about. After all, The TV movie was made BY FOX.
The ninth is my favouite, I find he never gets enough love.
Midnight_Tempest: WHATS THE WEBSITE?
0,14For all the joking I do
Gonna start watching after Hearts and Hooves Day
What's with the Dr. Who talk? What'd I miss?
0,14I admit that Tennant is much better than Smith
Because my number is not important
Private614 started it lol
smith isnt bad though
Placebo, we're talking about dari's favorite doctor
0,14but Smith is MY Doctor, because there's something I like
Matt Smith
Oh, I see.
they should stop writing him like tennant
Doctor House is best doctor. Period.
1,3lol, don't let dari catch you saying stuff like that :)
/me is broken, shattered, andlost
ohai kirzstryfe
I like the third doctor
mario_pony: i meant pilot episode
Their endding House
I know ;^;
:O
0,14also, i was watching an episode of Futurama today
Aw..
I am sad.
They're*
Pinkie is now free to destroy earth
Guys, how many Doctors are there in Equestria?
Normally I'd say something to that GabeofThrones, but I'm having a bad day and I really can't be bothered.
I wub House..
Midnight_Tempest: i'll go right now
0,14and bam, 4th Doctor reference
Michael4thCox: there's no stopping her you know
I just started to watch it, I got throught the first 3 season in about 2-3 weeks
Suddenly, SB.

Would it be talking with a mic, or text chat?
For a Q&A

thats what we were going to find out
Ok
as well as a time and day for it
It's 5 am here, so I'm not sure how much longer I can stay.
06Dari ): go to bread. . .
Drake
04FUCK
/me hides
XD
/me slaps Drake
go fix your drawing
04nou
):
okay Drake
we need to focus on the storyline
/me slaps Drake
/me avoids
04fuck woman
04I'm not here 24/7
unfortunately
though, Drake, sometimes I think you're more of an asshole than I am :3
04That's a bit of a stretch don't you think?
okay fine, Drake ):
but anyway
What happens after the airport?
04Like I said
04we head to the HQ
04Parachute out
04get told we work or die
04and sleep in Leo's room for the night
04After that
Leo should be like
*lays out newspaper*
04We get on a flight to the US
04and start our training
"This is your bed, and that's yours. The pile of lollies is your dinner."
04XD
Don't you mean Canada?
04The "beds" being blankets on the floor
04w/e
The "beds" are newspaper :{D
because Leo is horrible at taking care of children
8D
well canada
No such thing as more of an arsehole than NS
and Rhy pushes leo into a lake
:D
hah Xanbreon
;)
ohhaime
/me rapes Veyka
04anyway
04NS
04After the 9 months of training, which include anything we can think of
sonofabitch
04We are basically sent on our first mission
04somewhere
lmao
04Your turn. Shoot.
well
I thought YOU wanted to go into detail about the training, Drake
04I do.
Rhy breaks his nose
04Then BAM
Leo stands to the side clapping
04And Nathan is like "Holy shit"
And Nathan is shitting on the floor laughing
XD
04And then when rifle training comes around Rhy's like "How do I hold this thing?" and almost shoots Nathan
lmao
yes
And Nathan's like "Rhy, bitch!"
"STOP TRYING TO KILL ME"
04"PUT THE GUN DOWN"
And Leo's like "Rhy, put the damn gun down."
XD
I say this is PG-13+, yes?
04And then Nathan aces the markmanship test
04I was thinking M
Yes, M
04because shooting and blood and gore
04and swearing
8D
04and implied sex
04sure
yeah okay
:D
04Actually
04not Rhy
...
okay fine
dunno
but she's horrible at marksmanship
04Nathan accidentally switches off the safety and shoots him
lmao
okay!
And Leo is pissing himself laughing then
just felt like getting words in for randomnesss
XD
Drake
i could do a session of typing where i dont correct my mistakes
Leo's gonna be like
"I love you guys."
"FUCK YOU BOTH"
"I SWEAR THIS IS YOUR SETUP, LEONARD"
04XD
And Leo'll be like "Yep."
XD
anyway Drake
04Then comes bomb disposal
04DUN
04DUN
rooooooofl
04DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
04CUT THE RED WIRE
wait, who's the tech/mechanic?
04JUST TURN OFF THE TIMER YOU IDIOT
lmao
04Nathan is the software guy
04I imagine Leo's the actual electronics guy
Rhy's the mechanic then?
04Yeah
dunno
because see
04Rhy's the mechanic, Leo works with hardware, Nathan works with software
Rhy needs to know about mechanics
because aircraft
04obviously
04mechanics != electronics
well
04I figured they'd all work together in upgrading the Skyscraper
though it'd be mainly Rhy still
and I suppose Rhy would bitch if they did anything she didn't like
04Nathan does the coding on any of the more elaborate functions of the on-board computer, Leo fixes up an problems in the wiring, and Rhy makes the actual upgrades
04like weapons, armor etc.
Well sure
04Anywho
04First mission
yeah
it'd have to be something that'd stir up stuff
but not something huge like murdering a president or anything
04Encroaching on neighbouring territory?
encroaching?
04Messing up a communication outpost?
04Like, setting up something on land not actually owned by you.
04LIke Russia setting up a com outpost in US soil.
Well
04I figured the first mission
04Would be
I don't think our first mission should be long
04Us three and some back up
04Find a US com outpost
maybe destroying a US com outpost and destroy it?
er
finding
whatever
04Sneak in, break some stuff (dressed as Russians) and plant something that allows our contractor to stop the function of the outpost at his signal?
04Because breaking it and leaving doesn't help. They'll just fix it.
04Maybe a small remote-detonated bomb that isn't too powerful, but can be triggered from very far away?
04Dressed as a Russian spec-ops team, we break in, do our stuff, and leave.
04Hired by China, the US thinks Russia broke the outpost but doesn't have definite proof.
04Things start stirring up between the two nations.
I thought you said you wanted Russia and US to be on the same team
therefore it'd make sense for us to break into the outpost as chinese-dressed people and China pinned as the culprits
though
it wouldn't make sense
04Exactly
for military people sneaking/breaking in
to be dressed as their nation
04Us and RUssia start hating each other but by the end they realise China/Japanw as behind it
well
04somehow
04I dunno
I wasn't talking about the culprit not making sense
but the sneaking/breaking in
somehow we'd have to leave behind proof
but not obvious
accidental
04Dropping a Russian emblem?
04Russian dog tags
04?*
04That isn't solid enough proof for retaliation
That's way too careless
any china-specific/russia-specific bullets?
04Probably.
or weaponry
find some
04Weaponry definitely
that'd be good enough
and it wouldn't seem like it's done on purpose
04Leave behind a pistol
no
bullets should be enough
but if we have to
a pistol will do
no fingerprints though
will need to be careful on that
Rhy wears gloves anyway so that doesn't matter
dunno about Nathan and Leo
04When you're in a combat zone
04wearing gloves is an obvious idea
yeah true
but for guns it's a bit blunky
clunky
04Not really
for close range, SAP gloves etc. add weight to punches and so on
04Unless Nathan's sniping
and protect fingers and hands about stuff
04Which he won't be
yeah well, doubt he will
they'll go in through the ventilation
They drop on the surprised US fags
and kill them
then Nathan comes back BAWWWWWWWWWWWing
and Rhy's like "I lost my innocence, and not to Nathan either"
XD
04XD
04Nathan won't be like that
04He just won't kill at first
yeah well
04Then second or third mission
there has to be trauma
04have to kill someone
well
04Then comes the angst
they can't kill everyone I suppose
that'd be too much
for a mission like that
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9x18mm_Makarov
04Soviet bullet
04awesome
;o
if they kill too many people it'll be bad
04For a pistol as well
http://store.steampowered.com/app/111100/ needs more snuggle trucks *random*
04Exactly
/me hides
awesome
04it's covert mission
04not a kill everyone on sight mission
Yeh
Yeah
I suppose they'll just murder everyone in the main control room
04Break a few thingsw
04So it's not suspicious
where the three of them fuck up the electronics while the other teams go for the generator
04And then plant the bomb and run
and yeah
generator blows up
but the control room should remain somewhat intact
04NS
and the guys remain intact
04they aren't destroying the base
04They're damaging it
04Because blowing it up is kind of suspicious
04Plus the US would then enter a panic
well
it'd make sense to damage the generator at least
but not cause an outright explosion Drake
04Don't blow it up though
that's kinda what I meant, sorry
yeah
two-team mission
04Our team goes for the control tower, the other team does the generator
yeah
we all use the Makarov bullets
except Rhy does some knife wounds without the energy blade
otherwise that'd be too obvious
but she's not carving them up or anything
04yeah
04Slit their throat when they aren't looking
just disabling them long enough to not be a threat
yeah, that'd be okay to do
04Rhy would still be nervous about killing for the first time mind you
well
04But she'd be over it by the end of the mission
I don't think she'd try to kill
just wound enough to disable them
until Leo's hammers them with bullets
at least at the beginning
until the control room
04One or two of them will die by her hand though
yeah
anyway brb dinner
04So she's like "Oh...well, ok"
04k
Yeah, I'll go to bed Vi. Though isn't it 8 am for you now?
And you're not well, you shouldn't be missing out on sleep.
But yes, I need to sleep. Cya later.
okay Drake
back
/me slaps Drake
knock knock
XELI
/me hugs
~
/me cling
/me huuuuuuugs
Drake and I
have been talking non-stop
about the mercenary thing for several days
04hi
DRAKE
/me hugs
/me hugs back
04was playing BF3
04and I despise it
04a lot
04I mean
04I see an enemy
04"Oh look I better- oh no, I'm dead and he didn't fire a shot. Just my luck."
lmao
/me hugs Drake
anyway
04It's bullshit
>:
/me hugs
04I used to get 12 K/8 Deaths
04But now I'm, for some reason, up against 12 Prestige players
Ah
04Which means they've completed the ranking system 12 times
.-.
well
good luck
can't help you there
wait
does battlanfield have
prestiges
04apparently
04I asked my friend about it
04I downloaded the DLC to try and get this better rifle, but I can't even unlock it
o_O
04Because I can't kill anyone
04Because it's a Lance Corporal going up against 12 Prestige people
Famas? It seems like that gun can't be in any game without being stupidly strong.
except bf2
and bf3
04I can't get he Famas
04the
anywaaaaaaaaaay Drake, we've established what happens in the first mission
second mission?
04I suck at everything in the game
And in every game I've seen level does not always reflect skill at all. Except those with actually good level systems.
And aw
and is the first mission in daytime or night?
04Night
it makes more sense at daytime
04Alright then
I just envisioned it that way for some reason
04And NS, you still need a rival jet fighter
Rhy'll get one later
She'll still crap up his ass though
04Will the guy's grudge be personal or professional?
06<Drake> And NS, you still need a rival jet fighter

04Where do you think all this inspiration is coming from LOL
04I've been downloading Ace Combat music non-stop
06Exactry
04It's got some insanely good tracks
lmao
<Drake> Will the guy's grudge be personal or professional?
I doubt it'd be personal
professional
04Aww 'kay
04So
04"YOU BEAT MY RECORD! FUCK YOU!?
04Or something similar
yeah lmfao
personal
would be waaaay too coincidental
04Fair enough
04Well
well
I'd more over say that he's impressed
and wants to beat her
04Considering Rhy becomes the Demon of Singapore/insertcityhere and shoots down quite a few planes I don't think it's that coincidental
04fair enough
yeah
06So pretty much hunting the glory or whatever for taking her down
06makes sense
06and not sarcastic either aa
04Dem pilots have a lot of rivalry between the,
when Rhy first gets attacked
04them*
04she's like
04"FUCK HOW DO I FIRE THE MISSILES"
/me runs
lmao
she's like
"NATHAAAAAAAAAAN GET THIS BASTARD OFF MY TAIL!!!!!!!"
04No not really XD
04If anything, we'd save that kind of stunt for the climax.
04"Nathan, I'm on fire here, and I've still got a tango on my tail!"
04"Can you get him close?"
04"Yeah but...what are you planning?"
04"Get him over here, up close. I've got a plan."
he uses a bazooka
or rocket launcher
04Bad
04ass
XD
well
imo Rhy should shoot him down
at the end
not Nathan
04I never said it was Rhy's rival
since it's her archnemesis essentially
you said
Rhy needs a rival
04It could have just been Rhy was out of missiles, damaged, and unable to take down this last tango
04Meaning
well that could be a diff guy
04she's already shot her nemesis down
but her rival
should be shot down by her nemesis
04And some other guy gets her tail
alright
that makes more sense
04It's not going to be 1v1 the whole climax
yeah of course not
And fuck yeah
[20:24:11] <Drake> she's like
[20:24:17] <Drake> "FUCK HOW DO I FIRE THE MISSILES"
when she first gets in the jet
04XD
04Leo
04Leo's about to tell her and the instructor is like "NO SHUT THE FUCK UP"
She'll be like
XD
then she accidentally blows something up
04The instructor just glares at Leo afterwards.
Leo smirks
and then shows Rhy how to use it
Nathan'll just be like "oh snap owned"
04Of course Nathan will. He's the deadpan smartass of the trio.
duh
Anyway Drake
we need a mission set in a Shadow Moses Island-like area
dark, metal walls, etc.
like the front cover of Battleship, Drake :D
04Second mission. After the success of their first operation, four months afterwards Rhy, Nathan and Leonard are to take part in a lone-team operation along the coast of Japan - The United States have hired the services of Indie to sabotage the Japanese Naval Base on the east coast.
/me shrugs
Hm
04Indie being the CEO of the entire corporation
04Still don't have a name for the corporation as a whole though
yeah
04An offshoot of Zastava?
or story name
lolwut
04XD
XD
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zastava_Arms
04Maybe not
04It's Serbian
04Xeli i saw that TF2 topic on TST finally and now I'm playing TF2
04curses
you fail
and nawwwwwwwwww
Drake, where's the main base?
Canada's a bit of a strange place
06Yay drake
but I imagine it'll be their "home" in a sort of way
And Rhy'll be complaining about the cold
04Canada isn't where the HQ is
well
HQ is in US then?
04It's just where we've been allocated living quarters
actually that makes no sense
04Sure.
not US
Afghanistan?
or Russia, Drake? idk
04Russia
04Russia
04YES
XD
04Then I can have a girl named Esther
/me loves that name
...you're going to get Rhy pregnant?
06what
04fuck no
/me slaps NS
04I meant
04so the story can have a character named Esther
XD
04Maybe Indie's right-hand-woman
sure
Rhy hates her
Nathan swoons over her
Rhy bitchslaps him
04Sweet
and eventually kills her
04Esther is Indie's daughter
Alright
Well
we'll say that Rhy hates her while Nathan thinks she's pretty
04yay sexual tension
She's a conceited and arrogant bitch
quite cold-hearted and merciless
04I was imagining something more along the lines of a femme fatale, shy, but cold and merciless
04Which is why Indie warns Nathan to stay away from her.
04That causes a bit of tension between Rhy and Nathan later on
Well
04Then after 3/4 the way through the story, Nathan's like "Fuck that bitch"
Rhy definitely will wind up killing her
2/3
3/4's a bit too close to the end
<Drake> Which is why Indie warns Nathan to stay away from her.
04Indie sends Esther to kill Rhy, Nathan and Leo after they're branded rogues and Rhy kills her?
what sort of person is Indie anyway?
Yeah
04Imagine...hmm
04What's the character I'm looking for...
That ga-whatever person
from VCS?
04no
04no way
04The Shadow Lord/Giovanni/Slade
I'd go for Giovanni
04The Shadow Lord's meticulous planning, Givanni's style, and SLade's personality.
Slade's personality wouldn't suit a mercenary organization
it's more like Giovanni's personality
04Alright then
I see
04I'm so much better at TF2 than I am BF3
XD
well anyway Drake
Shadow Moses Island setting :D
MUST HAVE
04That's why i mentioned the Japanese Naval Base
04perfect SM setting
XD
04Also
04NS
?
04What city has a lot of towers?
04Not just really tall ones
...sydney?
XD
04Like, a lot of towersthroughout the city.
New York?
London?
Antarctica?
04London
04nah
04New York is too overused
04Chicago?
Hm, Drake
/me has a look
Dubai?
04Oooh
http://goitaly.about.com/od/sangimignano/p/sangimignano.htm
hehe
04Aerial combat in the towers of Dubai, while Leo and Nathan rappel down a tower
lmfao
06stop that internet
04:O
04Aww man
04Drone jam
lmfao
[20:55:03] <Drake> Aerial combat in the towers of Dubai, while Leo and Nathan rappel down a tower
check that link Drake
MEDIEVAL WALLS
04...
04We need to go there
yes
04SCOOT
04That was fun
06:3
06brb i need foooodss
04k
XD
/me hugs Drake
/me hugs Xeli too
/me hugs back
/me hugs both. Somehow
04Magic
XD
GROUP HUGS
Anyway Drake
we need to go to that place in italy
OR
Versailles
WE SHOULD GO THERE
04o-o
04Why?
because
WALLS
06whut
XD
04:I
:U
/me hugs Drake and Xeli
/me hugs back
04Anyway
04What should happen between the first and second mission?
04I want most character development to happen in those interims.
06hm
Rhy, Nathan and Leonard going to the beach.
And Leo refusing to get in.
So then Rhy and Nathan drag him in and he threatens to shoot them
06and now I imagine that thank you
04XD
04I guess they'd be happy after their first successful mission.
Yeah
06Nathan should totally get rather /bothered/ by thinking of the fact they are killing people at some point. Yay psychology.
06But yeah.
Nathan does get bothered
especially when he has to kill
Rhy on the other hand
isn't really bothered
or as much
04It's after the second or third mission that Nathan really starts getting disturbed by the lives he is taking.
yeah
he doesn't kill until the 2nd or 3rd mission
06And Leo has pretty much learned to cope with it .. decently at least.
04Especially when he is forced to use a .50 cal to save a fellow mercenary.
06So yeah.
Well
Leo's been in the company for at least 3 years
before he found Rhy and Nathan
04yeah
so he's pretty used to it
04But using a .50 on a person is overkill x10
04Which is why Nathan ends up so disturbed
yeah
Rhy doesn't really care I suppose
Since she gets over it
04She's like "We need to do this, so we might as well do it with as little emotional strain as possible"
well
Rhy's a sort of "I'll do what must be done" sort of person
aka kill or be killed
sorta like Kommander Kulesz/The Hensh
except they're more philosophically based
so derp
04Whereas Nathan is constantly thinking of the emotional and philosiphical implications of what he does
04Why he survives when the people he has to kill don't, whether they might have had families etc.
That's not philosophical
that's the "if"s
which are not worth thinking about
which Rhy constantly tells him
04But Nathan can't help but keep thinking of it because he's such a pussy and all
/me shot
lmao
04But nah, he's just a generally more thoughtful person than Rhy, which is why it takes her verbally beating him senseless to make him understand.
Yeah
and why she's developed a habit of doing that to everyone
because she lives around Nathan
makes sense
:D
06So does this mean
06Rhy is the dominant one in this relationship?
/me hides
04of course
04Just like NS and I
/me runs
lmao
06:3
:o
But yeah Drake
04yeah
yeah well
in between we don't need too much detail
most chapters will just jump from mission to mission
04I'd rather not
04A few chapters per interim
well Drake
04Then like, 7 chapters per mission
well I meant that
most of the things we describe
will just be missions
not the inbetween stuff
04Again
04most character development will be in the interims
04but alright
character dev will mostly be in training
and some interims
we're not going to have an interim after EVERY mission
04Yes we are >:|
04And no, character dev won't be mostly in training
04we are not having static characters throughout it.
04Since most of the questionable activity will be happening during the missions, the interims give us a chance to expand upon the character's thoughts and feelings.
of course not idiot
04Which, IMO is the most important part of a story
but most of the changes from kid to almost-mercenary will begin in training
04Obviously
and then psychological changes begin in missions
04But that's not character development
or at least half of it
04That's physical change
psychological you idiot
not physical
/me facepalms
you know, emotional, philosophical, etc.?
04Physical change will happen in training
04No one's morals will change during training
well
04Training doesn't have the impact of watching a bullet go straight through someone
they're being taught how to handle guns
04Anyway
04I need to go
and weapons
04Bed now
and how to kill people
etc.
/me hugs NS and Xeli
I'm pretty sure
04So?
that will change people
04They're kids
04They're naive
Yes
04Of course they change
they're 15
like us
04But they don't become killers or hardened mercenaries
by then our morals are pretty set in stone
04fuck
04I have to go
04bye
:\
/me hu-
D:

Altair
^
not too sure
you can
requires adding it as a folder to mIRC's server list though
I dont use mIRC's server list
Just adding it there will change the name?
Cos I use ZNC so its not a straightforward setup
Ah
you might be able to do add it to the serverlist
/server -a irc.server.net -p port -g Group "-w User:Pass"(If applicable) -d Description
you don't need -p
meh I use it since default is 6667 and what i use is 1337 ;p
lol
AND YOU FUCKIN KNOW WHY TOO!!! ;p
why so caps
/me slaps Altair
fucking bastard needs to start being active
But the thing is, that it auto changes the network name
to the name the network says its name is
whats the perks of having a bouncer XD
Always there, always watching
autoidentification via the BNC, having it connected 24/7
getting playback buffers
etc.
Also its the best way to winrar at idlerpg
plus fun features
what Xanbreon said
lmao
hmm..i doubt i'd need one but eh
BNC is like idleRPG cheatcode
who knows.
I need to set up idlerpg here
lol February 14th.
/me is a lazy fuckface
Yes
But your australian so we forgive you for it
lmao
Least you where if i remember right
if not, fuck off
<3
How is that relevant, Kangaroo Jack?
LOL
haha
not gonna fuck off Xanbreon
;)
Even if i ask rly nicely? ;3
so you're gonna fuck on Xambreon?
/me hides
Xanbreon*

lmao
Wait, you still JB? :P
/me slaps Skylands

jailbait
hah
Am I?
!stats
I have no clue
o;

Accept the new meme of Land Turtles.
I think I was 12 or 13, Xanbreon
!stats
Stats updating at http://www.ho-ohrealm.net/chat/chatstats...
Yeh something like that
Psyco little fucker at the same tome ;)
lmao
I have logs that I still cringe at
Hells yes
Thats the best part of IRC
XD
Logs you have thaty you know you have
That you never want to read
Or want anyone else to read
Rlly old ERP logs are the bestest for awkwardness

The game itself will be a lot longer than 3 hours Ingwaz, and suitably more epic. Besides, why work out all the personal hype on a demo when I can just wait for the whole thing to drool on.
Don't know any more
I just lost $65 to Toys 'r' us
/me gnaws on Meanwhile's arm
SadLawnchair, y u so sad? D:

SadLawnChair, are you a '90's kid?
The_4th_Wall: on what?
/me headbutts rainbro.
Recoil damage, son.
Sorry to hear that SadLawnchair. *hug*

Ohai LadyCanary, how long have you been here?
I don't know what you said buddy.
Their upcoming release of MLP merch
Headbutt is a bad move. :3
Just got here.
SadLawnchair: :( *hugs*
Meanwhile: because this way you get to try things out, explore the first areas, get a grasp of the classes and how they work, be better prepared for the game, and hopefully the demo will include the multiplayer, which will hopefully transfer over
/me headbutts everypony

Hello LadyCanary

Hi everypony.
/me comes back
some fast food joint is advertising on FB something about bacon being a good mood setter fo valentine's day. My comment was not g-rated but involved grease, meat and ended in "Giggity".
Did somebody say Friendzoned?

SadLawnChair are you a '90's kid?
You see what I did thar?
Fall off the gird for a while.
Who said Friendzoned?!
Nooooo body cares about Lawnchair.
Awww.
/me hugs the Lawnchair.
Ingwaz: I like to try things out in the field, explore everything, I got a handle on the classes in the first 2 games and frankly, everything is better when you're unprepared for it.
Which is why I put beetles in your sandwich.
Cmon lawnchair. You're obviously begging for attention.
?
SadLawnChair See if this cheers you up a bit. It always does for me. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCwQ1RP5G00

You know we care. So stop.

It's funny. We're studying Jazz and the Blues in my Jazz history class. Ha ha.
Who...said friendzoned...?
:|
perhaps Meanwhile, but this is only a small taste of the actual game, its to get hype for the game going again, and to prove that hey, they didnt screw up, its still awesome
SadLawnchair said friendzoned because he got friendzoned. He is in the zone of friends TOY_PON3 are you happy now.
^
SadLawnchair: I'm...sorry..
Dont be dude
You have nothing to be sorry about
Meanwhile: Aaand thank you for answering my question -.-
i got friendzoned once called her a bitch and left.
...
Do you wanna talk about it?
Ingwaz: they won't let it be released on Steam, that's a fairly major flaw for me personally.
Dang, Italian opening grows on you
OH MY GOD...this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=rbBbV_zP1d8
I never got friendzoned, I just got rejected.
TOY_PON3: anytime.
i dont know what to tell you there Meanwhile
SO, TRU gets $65, and Mickey D's gets about 15.
I think I'm just going to go to sleep early, or something.
So whatever.
can somepony help me find a cover for the song 'avast fluttershy's 'butt''
SadLawnchair: Maybe that will help.
Please stop with the links.
TOY_PON3: Same here
I didn't really get friendzoned. I knew I was there and went for it anyway. All I got in return was "I'm sorry"
fillyfillyy: just search youtube
wanna know whats better than the italian opening? The german opening http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc&list=PLDF1B4C469E6308E9&index=21&feature=plpp_video
SadLawnchair: I know how you feel. But I know things will turn around.
I never got anything because I never went looking for it. Go figure.

Ummm....
Stop the links please.
fillyfillyy: especially with THOSE tags you'll come across something unsavory for sure

yes no streaking
I loved science class
1,3could do it just fine, just hated the classes
kirzstryfe: but...science is fun :'(
Except for physics
science is all i study
but all science classes are physics
Personally I find most science that isn't in space dull.
1,3my HS teacher(only had 1 for 4 years) had 2 settings: projects or worksheets
1,3that was it
Well everypony...
I mean the part of science class called physics

0,5Something we'd like to share real quick.
0,5Derpy_Hooves is the founder of the 20pc community commission projects. Basically, they create large commisions with peoples' OC's (Original Characters) like these: http://twentypercentcooler.net/pool/show/129 ... and to show their appreciation to the Bronystate community, he is making commission pictures, featuringthe OC's of YOU GUYS. Now, not everyone can participate, so please only
0,5participate if you really truly want to.
0,5They will have many artists working on them, such as phantomdarklover and cartoonlion. Go ahead and check out this link to see what scenarios are open for your OC to join in. http://twentypercentcooler.net/forum/show/3797?page=4 ... Once youve selected, PM the user Derpy_Hooves and give him your OC information, picture, what scenario you would like to be in, etc. Try to have an OC
0,5prepared already, as not to lose time.
0,5Got questions? PM Derpy_Hooves. Thank you for your time!

emangamer: Enieghgamer
11,01My life improved through two main things. Bronyism was a catalyst of sorts.
done*
otakon: har de har
hiya Nittany_Discord!
emangamer: waht?
A LAW! MLP is the cure to EVERYTHING!
11,01Hi otakon
The_4th_Wall except Diabeetus.
The_4th_Wall: except for cancer. read it and weep showed us that
Everlasting_Joy: rough day?
/me is PONYdunami
I just like watching people react to MLP, the same way I do while watching it.
MahBoi777 nope, one of the better ones.
OMFG The_4th_Wall has NEVER played a mario game!!!!
Makes things more enjoyable
Pinkie Pie is the cure for Diabeetus
WHAT!?
good good
Pinkie Pie?
yup
indubitively The_4th_Wall
The_4th_Wall She is the cause of diabeetus.
00,03Whats up, guys!
Nittany_Discord: bronyism always helps. its always good to know that you've joined quite the extended family, and that that family genuinely cares about each other for the most part
about half of it I should say.
I R fancy!?!
now i'm listening to 8 bit versions of all the songs thanks moop
Trust me. It works out.
Howdy Scoot-Scootaloo.
hi Scoot-Scootaloo
Spectre: me too
Hello Scoot-Scootaloo
hi Scoot_Scootaloo
00,03Hope you guys have an awesome Valentines day :D
hiya Scoot-Scootaloo
Forever alone...
me too
/me hugz chat for being awsome
eating Lobster and Steak
Scoot-Scootaloo: mass effect 3 demo comes out on valentines day, of course its going to be awesome
Thank you Scoot-Scootaloo <3
/me hugs fillyfillyy.
Valentines Day? You mean like any other ordinary day?
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
/me glomps Spectre :D
If you give the cure the cancer she cures,they cancel out.
its valentines day?
glomps?
forever aloooooone
11,01Well, I am seeing someone for depression issues, and he's helped defeat them (w/o meds). BronyState has giving me things to do for you all here and for me.
No need for a cure. NO cancer
Scoot-Scootaloo I'm forever alone, but I've learned to take joy in it in some aspects.
What is that from anyways? "Forever Alone" Been looking for the origin
11,01I'm pretty much the happiest I've been in years.
00,03^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
thanks Scoot-Scootaloo, you too
A glomp is a combination of tackle and hug
11,01From having friends and managing stress.
flutterSpin http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/forever-alone
Nittany_Discord: i technically have clinical depression
Cancer is not the focus anymore; We don't need to cure what's not there
A glomp is a hug at speed
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
00,03Can I share soemthing with you guys? Since this seems like the appropriate moment?
/me 11,01hugs emangamer
but i'm never sad
well Nittany_Discord, i know some take it as hollow words, but i think that generally, if one ouf us needed help getting through something, the others would be their for them
Nittany_Discord: I will always be your friend. No matter what <3
Got a guy at work who refuses to watch tv or play games. What does he do instead? Flurt.
Scoot-Scootaloo: you're secretly a chicken?
Let us never speak of that again
Scoot-Scootaloo: Sure
we already knew that
Shoot Scoot-Scootaloo.
yes
Spit it out ^__^
do tell
00,03Ingwaz :D
00,03No this is SRS
03aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sorry, it was too good to pass up
okay
Sneas :o
Scoot-Scootaloo: I know. I love you too, you dont have to say it
/me sits down
SRSLY SRS?
00,03A year ago, I managed to attempt to ask out my ol' friend.
bah. Forever Alone is another weird 4chan type thing? eh.
For SRYL
uh-huh?
oh dear...this will either end really well or really poorly
00,03She was exactly like me, and we knew we liked each other.
00,03inb4 pity btw
uh oh
Scoot-Scootaloo: foreverapitty
I see, please go on
This is getting unsettling
00,03Anyway, as I walked toward her, she looked back, and started walking faster.
and then the chat waited, in hushed silence for Scoot-Scootaloo to finish his story
lol
:D
Then a car ran you over?
00,03I was confused, so I called out her name.
yes?
Oh great
"Ted, HEY TED!"
...
00,03She just said "leave me alone".
Sheila come back!! I made you muffins!
ow
:(
/me needs stream!!
ouch
:'(
/me cries
Ever figure out why?
00,03I didn't know what happened to her. 
wah.....
thats terrible
00,03I never found out why.
lmao
Men, we don't know what we did
00,03It was exactly a year ago.
Forever
Alone
hm
I never found out why my gym teacher hates brownies
00,03When that happened, that is.
Love triangle, fear of commitment, or some other business huh
Ouch. That can't help
Ouch :'(.
thats really odd Scoot-Scootaloo...i'm surprised you didnt pursue her further to find out
Scoot-Scootaloo: Dont worry, we will always love you (physically)
srry to hear that ,am
*man
emangamer: LOL
00,03So for the next couple of months, I was a cynical bastard. I was still confused
Let you know, my personality is Twilight and I would like to marry a Fluttershy
00,03Sad, and just apathetic
You guys realize how tight we are, here in this chat?
/me is still a cynical bastard
00,03And then on June, I started watchin MLP FiM
and you felt BETTER
yes?
Huzzah!
who wuldn't?
Scoot-Scootaloo: In every life we have some troble but when you worry you make it double dont worry, be happy.
I'll be honest
the love has do... too soon?
00,03lol, I guess you can say that!
Dang, moop
i started watching after seeing Apple.mov
if it wasn't for MLP I would probably be in a deep funk atm
/me feels good and clean after his shower, then bursts into flames
moop: I hear a song coming on, lol
:D
Where the streams at.
There is no stream?
00,03Guys, I have to be honest, if it weren't for MLP and people like you guys, I would be a depressed mofo.
I was reminded of Team Rocket, moop :D
your not the only one
lol Midnight_Tempest i know the feeling
no. There's a canal, though
Scoot-Scootaloo, you aren't alone in that, know that.
Polydunami lol
Because I'd be in that club with you.
I would be depressed too
/me hugs Scoot-Scootaloo
00,03And thats the story of why I became a brony.
I'm still fighting between living with my mom and finding a job so I can move out. I do NOTHING in this house. NOTHING except give her 1/2 of my money
You may find yourself asking, where the buck is IshBestPony, and you may find that the answer is right here
flutterSpin: same here
Hey IshBestPony
ohai IshBestPony
You get a better deal than I, at least.
must have been something wrong Scoot-Scootaloo, if you were both friends, makes no sense why she would run away from you
something must have happened

meh, I never had a crush
inb4 giant fucking text wall
/me Lonely as I am, together we cry...
Before ponies I didn't have much of a life. The only thing that kept me afloat was being in my schools drama. Then last semester I couldn't make drama due to schedule conflicts. So for a majority of that semester I sat at home on my computer all day and did nothing. I had no social life what so ever. Then I found ponies. Now, this semester, I'm still not in drama but I dont care. Despite not going outside to hang with
fillyfillyy since you hate valentines day, will you be mai valentine*trollface*
yes
/me hugs
a little something adorable to lighten things up
http://i44.tinypic.com/6s3sqb.jpg
/me hugs emangamer
That is SO CUTE
OH MY GOD
/me hugs emangamer
00,03I think its safe to say we all know what it feels like to be isolated
inb4 except ME
sorry fillyfillyy, I have to deny ur valentine request
00,03Lost, forgotten, abandoned...
I love my friends
United
In real life too
noooo!!!!! WHY!
... ok
i remember our brake up it was on v-day.
aye, i went through a pretty rough period when i was younger too, kids can be really cruel, i'm sure we all know that
cuz I haz trollface on right nao
I've got something to tell all y'all who feel isolated from society.
go out and do something?
lol
I've had major crushes throughout high school and a few years after
Ingwaz Hell no!
Consider why you are isolated.
stay home, watch ponies, get pissed runk?
I have felt isolated since i moved to texas in 6th grade....I fucking hate texas because of it
drunk*
bai everpony
Ingwaz: that's crazy talk! the outside buuuurns! jk
The last crush I had was a major downer
You are probably isolated because you just don't fit into society, and guess what, that's just fine!
Ingwaz: same but get high
bye IshBestPony
Take care IshBestPony.
I started watching MLP because I was curious. I liked it ^^ . But :( Even my brother thinks Phineas and Ferb is stupid.
I got sent a rejection message on facebook last June
/me hugz and nomz MahBoi777 and Everlasting_Joy
well Everlasting_Joy, i'm somewhat isolated because #1 i prefer a bit of solitude, #2 i live in a small town and theres nothing to do here, #3 i cant stay out and about too much due to my school and family duties and #4 even in town, theres not much to do anyway
i tried showing my bro and one of my friends and nothing phased them
Hey! That is my mane IshBestPony, do you know how dirty it is?
I live in the middle of bumbuck nowhere
and I'm a hermit
I like being alone, it's quiet, lol
10,02So much heartfelt talk in here...
Let me finish my speech folks.
Ever since, I've been very cautious about falling in love with anyone
/me snuggles with otakon inside of his shell
hold on!
Machismo <-- Funny word
/me shows Everlasting_Joy his Trollface "U Mad"
I don't snuggle emangamer! I'll hug ya though.
heya Kaslai
SuperBrony64: I enjoyed your very inspiring talk over skype, I never thanked you for that
/me hugs emangamer
same here otakon
SuperBrony64: we're bronies, and that means we're family
/me snuggles with otakon regardless
Consider what it take to "fit into" society, it would mean abandoning your very identiy.
Hello.
/me sighs "Fine....."
Which is a crime as bad as murder.
BROHOOF
she told me we could still be friends i told her she was a b***h and to f**k off.
Wheere the strams at.
firefox crashed :(
I'm not going to fit into society. I am my own person ^__^
i havent even been coming to brony state for that long, month and a half maybe? I was a bit apprehensive about having to fit in with a new group that was already well established
SuperBrony64, care to add something to the conversation? lol
I wish i had a another brony around me to hang with
yet i was pretty much immediately accepted
not on atm and HI Lawnchair how are you my friend?
One day I will find my cutie mark!
what Crazy mayhem have i missed?
I have a few brony friends myself
Mee, too
irl
Not very well, otakon
that was my early brony days, showed me part of what it means to really be a brony
Friendzone shenanagins got me down, and whatnot.
I'm a very isolated person because when I see the stupidity and atrocities of society, I can't help but grow disgusted.
haven't talked to her ever since.
what the?
I converted only one of my friends, and he gets on here almost every day.
how's it going?
I honestally dont know what my cutie mark would be. I'm not really good at anything particular.... it sucks being mediocer at everything
i know how that is a bit Everlasting_Joy, i'm a fairly analytical person so i see a lot of what is wrong with the world and it does bother me sometimes
i wish we were still together.:(
One year in Vancouver, there was a lightning storm that coincided with the annual fireworks show that summer
Lawnchair: I'm sorry to hear that, but don't worry my friend. You'll find someone as long as you just keep looking and don't lose hope.
the saying ignorance is bliss is very true
i love sitting on my back porch and watch the rain and/or storm just go by...wind feels good and sound is enticing...
Ingwaz: I know...it really is
Jack of all trades, master of none... or no one cares to use you for
I have kind of accepted my forever alone status....
i have spent literal months at a time just thinking thinking thinking about everything wrong with the world, so much mental stress
otakon: Same here man...
Ingwaz: good way to drive yourself mad if you want to do it
okay, brb need MOAR COFFEE!
Ingwaz, I'm a very analytical person, so to see this repulsive stuff has made me grown very disdain of the outside world.
one thing i have always said you save money :D
I'm not much of a worrywort, to be honest
/me slowly wakes up and looks around
Hey guys.
hey TOY_PON32
Hello TOY_PON32
Hey TOY_PON32.
Hey TOY_PON3
Hai
otakon: thats something about myself i already know, i'm not a mentally stable person, i regularly have to keep myself in check and it has taken literal years to do so.
hi TOY_PON32
I feel better now
Hey TOM_P... I mean TOY_PON32
good!
sometimes my "bloodlust" as i refer to it, can get really high
The worst nights are where you just lie awake thinking about how much you suck and how many thing you have done wrong
/me tackle hugs TOY_PON32 you are happy now!!
ouch...
HUZZAH!
the fun has been doubled!
/me huts fillyfillyy back
^
Yup
lol
emangamer oh yeah, those are the worst, especially if you don't take to shame well.
emangamer: i've developed a little trick for that actually, as i'm frequently revisted by unpleasant memories, every time one comes up, clap your hands in front of your face, do so swiftly, the sound should startle you and snap you out of it
brb though, dinner
I don't really have any reason to be ashamed of my life
DINNER
I just want to move on
Damn...you all are describing me...
emangamer: yeah i sometimes start crying
MahBoi777 Dinner.
xD
ok maybe not cry about it
ok have...fun?
Is it ... wait, what was I hoping it to be time for?
Spectre it's o.k. to cry in this fanbase.
aye
the only thing to make me cry "manly" tears is My Little Dashie
00,03*
indeed, the world says emotions are a sign of weakness, theyre wrong. emotions are strength, to reject them is weakness
I still refuse to read it
Spectre, still, you can cry in this fanbase.
^
so who else is going to be alone tommorow?
ok...:'(
leik me
when I get depressed, I think about all the good things the have happened, bad things should stay in the past. I used to live in the past alot
ME!
fillyfillyy me.
I kind of will.....
fillyfillyy: you've got us so you dont have to be alone
IDK
00,03meh...
http://www.atlfades.net/lounge/src/129774233521.png this cheered me up
That's it. I'm pulling out the stops on this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1O0ErRhdoI
no one in this fandom is really ever alone
my Little Dashie needs to be made into a film so the Whole world will cry
Soemoen should stream.
/me will be Scoot-Scootaloo's special sompony
Nope :3
And I thought I was the only one that things deep
I'm going to spend my valentine's day with my x...
Ha ha, 'And that Guy.'
box 360 HAHA!
Shizuka?
eeyup... i am that guy :P
me too spectre, you getting mass effect 3?
13ohai
Ohai Shizuka
First off
haven'tplayed any of them yet
will YOU have a special somepony toomorrow
/me huggles Shizuka
so idk yet
Secondly
13<3
Natleyn or Flaria for username for Tribes?
00,03hey Shizuka! You also missed my life story!
13hmmmmm
Howdy Shizuka.
13i saw scoot~
13flip a coin <3
00,03oh...
Also, afaik, I'm going to be alone on Valentine's Day
i was actually going to give a completely platonic valentine to a pegasister tomorrow, but my only class got cancelled so now i cant
oh right, It's today for me.
And I'm quite happy
Shizuka: Okay <3
/me missed Scoot-Scootaloo's life story :(
not that anything happened
hello Lawnchair
Ingwaz: That's cold...damn school
00,03um... tails?
I'm not interested in anyone at the moment
Shizuka: Going with Natleyn :3
i suppose i'm weird in the relationship department, i see a lot of people, many of them perfectly good looking people. yet i do not find them attractive at all, at least not physically
^
i'm usually the type to go for mental and personalty over phsyical
I got a friend I'm going with so it's all good. Not looking for love right now
Anyone see Oh My Goddess? Yeah...
Oh Goodness
theres this girl in my 4th period shes shy and doesn't talk much i like her but i am too ashamed to tell her how i feel.
Just do it
hi Shizuka
DO IT
flutterSpin, I have actually
00,03I read courage wolf pictures to get me going!
brb
:D
ok
I guess its funny that I like Fluttershy the best
I'm weird
I like Rarity the best
Rarity always surprises me
mario_pony: what do you think is the biggest obstacle to talking to this girl? is it what might result or what you fear might result?
Yep
Applejack = Best
Definitely the most complex.
Can I put something in perspective for everyone? Here we are sharing deep, painful, shameful, and overall sad emotions to complete strangers, yet all of us are on a "it doesn't leave this room" basis.
You wonder why I love this fandom?
Sadly, I would find Applejack ... intimidating?
but she talks to my ex and she probably told her about our breakup.
Rarity kind of grew on me; I did not like her at first
Because all of us are bosses....
seems wierd but reminds me of seeing one of farmer's daughters around where i live...
mario_pony: its hard working up the courage, i understand, i really do, but think about it this way, you like her right? if you dont do anything about it, you wont get to be with her, guarenteed. If you do give it a shot, you've got a chance, not sure how good the chance is, but its way better then 0% chance. worst case scenario, she says no, you feel like an idiot for a few days, and you move on, best case, she says yes, and tha

I've always been wary about telling someone about how I feel about them
the one I marry would be my best friend... when I get some friends
I developed a crush on someone last year and I think it was obvious
They sent me a rejection message on Facebook
nice
Ooof.
Polydunami: preemptive dumpings are the worst (I think)
So immature. Post through Facebook, texting, or some indirect method
RackishTilt: well when we broke off i told her she was a bitch and to fuck off.
i haven't had a single date or even a crush...is that bad?
diabetes incoming!!
I still see her regularly and it really bugs me

fillyfillyy ikr
flutterSpin: you like where there isn't vocals?

I guess that would be electronic? or house? eh different genre
(\

I live my life to the fullest. Hang with friends, enjoying everything im given, and loving the feeling of not dealing with stress and depression. I am not in any hurry to have a relationship. Am I wrong?

And why is he forever alone?
He's awesome

Some girl ran off. He never did find out why

Damn that sucks. Well I'm sure someday he will find his one. Obviously she wasn't.
God I wish this was around while I was in High School
O.o
Apparently, she was exactly like her?
mario_pony: i feel your pain bro, i was a big jerk to girls i was involved with too. i friend zone'd as often as i was friendzoned just to make a point
otakon: I feel bad for being in high school when you say that...
Otakon: Same...would have mademy day better when i got home
TOY_PON3: it's all behind
lol
^^
it's just another day in the world for me too Polydunami, LOL
but I do enjoy the free chocolate, given it doesn't give me diabeetus
well don't be
otakon: ikr?
RackishTilt: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo4OnQpwjkc
K
otakon, personally, I'm glad I'm in college with MLP, but to each their own.
Why all the sadness in the chat? D:
RackishTilt: makes me feel better sometimes.
Well ponies, I'm going to sleep.
Hello RaveBrony
graduated for 2 years
indeed
I dont like coming back to an unhappy pony chat! :(
I will sleep happy and content knowing that all of you guys got mah back....
MLP makes things great
recalling the horrible lives we had before MLP
i'm pretty happy
Thank Scoot-Scootaloo for the sadness in the chat
Hi RaveBrony it's fine now
:)
Night emangamer.

Good night emangamer

Without ponies, my life would be miserable right now
night emangamer
bye emangamer
fillyfillyy I can't draw, AT ALL! So I'll just. . . umm. . . I don't know.
TOY_PON3: Iknowdatfeelbro.jpg
/me hugs emangamer good night.
TOY_PON3: enjoy high school while you can
It wudnt have to do with the upcoming/already here day wud it? O.o
you should draw 2 ponies together being awsome and happy and brohoofing
times like this i want to find a working darwing chatroom
Everlasting_Joy did you ever see my Princess Luna :)
I don't think I'd like to base my happiness on ponies
to be honest
Yeah, see his Luna! :)
Polydunami: may I ask why?
MahBoi777: i will. gots one more year after this one
RaveBrony: I have no idea, we need Pinkie!
^^
going to high school next year thank god i have mlp and bronystate
TOY_PON3 Yes, but I have forgotten to comment on it. I can remedy that now.
I dunno, really
It's fine but did you like it? ^^
have fun with that mario_pony
gnight emangamer
Cya emangamer
I mean, it's true ponies make me happy and all
But I don't know
dammit brb
Anybody here excited about the Fighting is Magic game?
I ME
ok
Ponies are absolutely great :) its another thing i can happily express :P
there are other things that make me happy besides ponies. but for those who have only ponies i can see why it is important
TOY_PON3 of course!
Lol, i have Many things that make me happy xD
tits
TOY_PON3 there's a reason my signature's third line is "You artists make me so jealous."
random word...
when the time comes you need to branch out and find other joys in life because ponies loving and tolerating might be around forever but you might just outgrow the fandom. it happens. love, tolerate and find your happiness, yeah?
http://www.mane6.com/ So excited
RaveBrony: so many friends!
^
I'm more excited for My Little Investigations, honestly ^__^
I agree, RackishshTilt :P

11,01Cloud-to-ground potential is 1 million volts for a return stroke, and the amperage is 15 kA - 20 kA on average. Typical values are 30 kA. This is for negative flashes. Positive flashes have typical currents of 300 kA
11,01kA = 1000 A
/me derps
