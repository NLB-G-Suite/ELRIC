10,02Is that Heroes?
Parties are good.
10,02I need to get that game...but my computer probably isn't cool enough to handle it :/
i have ponies... on my screen
Only part of me like Rainbow Dash is that I'm loyal.
hehe
we are the same species
I wouldn't think I had any in common with twilight or Fluttershy...that isn't right...

WOW

Then go look in the past MB.
05,15I got Fluttershy and then Twilight, and then the rest was pretty equal amongst Applejack, Rarity and Pinkie PIe
and then he left
ok...
The problem about Rainbow Dash is I avoid competition. I never go headstrong into an issue
I got mostly Twilight and Applejack
00,03Second highest was Applejack
who's playing?
how are you today?

no rainbow dash? not even a little
05,15None. I was expecting Fluttershy and Twilight to be high though
/me "I was 100% rainbow dash, and 100% applejack"
/me "Does that make me 250% pony?"
that reminds me of a song
I really haven't seen anyone be like Rarity, unless they like fashion
You can't be, because that would be 250% which is impossible.
/me "ALL THE PONIES!"
/me "Do you mean 'thinks' Phase4?"
05,15also that probably explains why I don't like Rainbow Dash very much

Nittany*
11,01I get mad at companies that screw gamers over, which is pretty much any AAA publisher nowadays.
It's likely to continue downhill from here, albeit slowly.
11,01Ubisoft is one of the worst though.
I have one too ^-^
Nittany: Blizzard?
05imo, the 6th isnt that bad
UbiSoft is immensely bad at it. Their DRM is astonishingly bad.
i think i just fellt my brain move when i sneezed
Here's a fun fact:
poor infinity ward
On january first, their uplay servers were down. People contacted UbiSoft to get it fixed.
11,01EA bans people from playing games.
I know certain companies get bad rep, but I objectively look at their product. Then again, their product reflects their rep
But I don't think it's as good as 5, myself.
Not happening. Why? Well, Tech Support'd gone home for the weekend.
...
One ruined C&C and one money whored COD
i like trains
And it's likely to just keep getting worse, sadly.
Gearbox is very good about their customer service
Gearbox is great.
treyarch gave me zombies. theyre alright by me
11,01EA is trying to be a third parent.
11,01They are Orwellian with their titles.
No
that was best proposal ever
Either way the only games i buy from them now are Mass effect and few other good titles
"cuts into fillyfillyy's head" yeps its still there
Frankly, I think I'll just avoid EA/UbiSoft for the time being.
johnjoseco is online on DA be ready for him to join soon
EA's screwed over enough series for me, and UbiSoft's DRM pissed me off more than enough.
my jaw literally dropped
I must leave, goodbye!
DRM?
to bad i dont know how to close this head :P
11,01They all get away with everything they do.
oh
my computer's being wierd. ill see you guys later.
Anything from CD-keys to UbiSoft's astonishingly bad always-online bullshit.
Borderlands 2 For the Fricken win
11,01Because most gamers don't know or don't care about not buying from them.
Only dev and publisher i trust is valve
bbc in a sec
http://joviebear94.deviantart.com/
11,01I trust Valve and indie companies.
Same here
Maybe some others but valve is the only i know wont screw you up for cash
diablo3 was a joke

There's coming a torchlight 2, with ONLINE play

No it won't.
11,01Call of Duty is turning into an MMO.
Oh, did they switch D3 to a pay-to-play model? Really?
No they didn't.
ugh, Call of Duty. PR disaster
11,01Maybe in a couple of years.
it is extremely effective
Because yours is by far the more unlikely and illogical.
BRB
11,01Activision is pretty much untouchable because of the mass popularity of CoD. Kotick could eat a baby in public and get away with it.
I hadn't heard anything about P2P for D3.
lol
but I'm still buying ME3 when it comes out
05im not
Though it CAN be solo'd, just probably not the highest difficulty levels.
Hello
i am no longer punctually correct when referring to call of duty
11,01And lobby for SOPA-like shit.
and never plan to
11,01Because they have investors-over-consumers syndrome.
Oh I know.

but now i've just gotten one 3 times in a row for the same fast travel inFNV
11,01SOPA is couch in Spanish.
ME gusta
Eh, even if I had played ME1 and 2, I wouldn't like 3, I think.
3 has a nice idea which has been missing, multiple play modes
The demo provided at E3 was a shooter. A pretty looking one but still just a shooter
ME?
able to play RPG, shooter or story mode
Mass Effect
We'll see.
I wont be buying it either way
Some retcons may come up, but overall, the storylines are meshed reasonably well together.
no?
11,01THQ still pitches the used sales lie for example.
Tey are also making a Warcraft movie
It is all the news in zeh world!
But then you, well, do it over and over to see the other abilities/classes
11,01Right now, I hope the entire industry crashes.
Starcraft II was actually k but yeah not solid
It just features some bad business decisions.
Got it, i got stuck and quit

but my stream went kaput
and a reason for this 4 year masters degree

too bad I had that shit yesterday, ended up having to reinstall my browser in the end
yes, i live with them :P
How is everyone doing today?
I have no friends.
11,01Activision is infamous for practically controlling their studios.
:)
Just to make you mad
11,01EA does it to a lesser degree.
Just Fine Kernel. Just Fine. How about you?
And giving them a year to do the games they want
I'm doin great
i don't play online or xbox live or psn
No problem....I'm the boss.
gotta brb, feet need defrosting again >_<
I want some Futurama :D
Oh, wait, whoops. No it wasn't. :D
11,01Go indie.
Yearly releases are just quality destroyers
not some FUCKING prequel
or some FUCKING side story
Like I said.
They say NOW that it's the last one of this story.
i have an idea...he should stream the stream
Well this conversation has definetly went wacky.
11,01That was pretty popular.
But I wouldn't count on it.
maybe our grand children
This conversation's turned rather caustic.
no, we'd just see infinite loading bars
W00t some PF!
oh this
silly me
a band of some sort?
05a few ppl messaged me beign sad they missed this
oh the concert cool
you are about to find out
05,15....I don't want to live on this planet anymore
11,01Maybe when the economy improves, we'll see some positive change.
11,01Maybe.
11,01I don't count on it.
11,01Because if something is profitable, why stop.
Nittany: Stick to indie games.
lol
11,01e.g. CoD Elite, CoD itself, Online Pasess.
11,01*passes
And ArenaNet. They're cool.
11,01Sequelitis
11,01Definite IF.
05but yeah
ArenaNet had its up and downs with Guild Wars
05i promised shine on
05so here it is
yep.
Every year
@_@ Cause I'm seeing things....
^
we are, it is groovy
11,01Most of them.
Agree
Pinkie Floyd...it must be done
05,15So many kids
Its like..Watching the earth being born...
They cant tell quality from bile of trash
THAT is an acid trip.
@_@ Its like watching the sun slowly expand and engulf the earth....but slowly....
11,01Forgive me for saying kids then.
I'm rather sad that I wasn't around when we watched Yellow Submarine
Its...Its amazing...
That would have been.... beautiful...
Well, I've got to go, cya tomorrow
05,15leave the gameplay intact though
11,01But we still have the problem of gamers not knowing when to say no to games.
05,15I don't know, the REmake of resident evil was DAMN good
yeah i hated mario3d
Never played Resident Evil
just going for whichever has the largest advertising budget
05,15yeah, I loved that one
that one updated the voice acting...
Well to be fair Nittany, there are still plenty of truly good titles being made.
11,01Quality is subjective.
05,15but I missed the terrible voice acting
Or atleast give the players the choice of corner shots or over the hsoulder.
shoulder*
Just for this coming year of 2012 alone.
11,01I just refuse to support their business practices.
Nittany: Then you refuse to encourage the GOOD publishers?
Which do still exist.
11,01I'll buy from them.
11,01I'm talking AAA ones.
dat sound= legit
not my genre, but respectable
old stlye open world
11,01I own Skyrim.
hard reset?
in the gaming community
11,01Haven't bought Hard Reset, but did play the demo.
05SHINE
05ON
05YOU CRAAAAZY
05DIAMOND
you shone like the suN!
11,01And PIPA.
HA HARD RESET
Anyone there? Man, I haven't been here in years...
lol
11,01So they are banned.
i'm not going to get it
hi
wait...minecraft is coming to xbox? since when?
....RANDOM WINDOW
and shiiiiiine!
Guess how the movie ended. :3
Its been real empty here for the past month, dont think anyone knows this channel is still here
Baldur's Gate II.
I hvent mined yet
05,15I had that too.
11,01Which I honestly predicted would happen.
11,01I felt it.
eh
But because of the business policy around it.
well ofc, damn moneygrubbers
skipping T^T
make*
EVERY TIME I set up camp, there's that shithead at the edge of the place.
GIVE US A SEQUEL IN A YEAR! LIKE OUR MADDEN FRANCHISE!
NOMNOMNOMPIE
hi
HOW?
11,01Oh.
They still doing that? I thought... well last I heard they were still debating
people buy it
they sell it
05hows quality?
it's skipping and pausing tons
and we got suckered into the business model, and no one has screamed loud enough to change it
yah
11,01Stream is fine for me.
nowadays
dat brass
Okay, enough ranting about games. I'm in a bad mood, and this isn't helping.
you could just DOWNLOAD roster updates
11,01Yeah.
but
05wait untill they play sorrow
Yeah my brother is in a group of 8 people. It takes them a good 3-4 years.
05NOW THAT is a trip
or 99, or 2000, or 2001 i believe
Hey.
12ohai
I very much enjoyed kotor
4There were a few others... but I forget them...
4Heh...
05well
05planned on the whole thing
2 was ok, I wish they made a third. They were planning it but they didnt.
05cause it was requested by a few that missed it
anyone playing anything interesting atm?
Xd
11,01I'll end that, in my opinion, the mainstream industry is too corrupted for my tastes. The only fix is either mass gamer boycotts (that stick) or a collapse.
XD*
it's unlistenable for me
Battlegrounds 2 was the best
12herpderp
4Awesome. I've changed over the past few years...
^
http://derpy.me/pKhjR
Eh, I think it reflects how the economy is tanking too
11,01And break the oligopoly.
and the corruption
4Yep... I haven't been on here in years. I'm over at DarkSpyro now... been there for a while...
*ashamed* I never played KOTOR
do they have an irc channel?
C7 still turns up here too.
here
I have a link
hold on
lol. Everyone says to play it, but I just don't want to.
KOTOR is one of the great star wars rpgs
/me downloads poster and heads to kinko's
time for Astronomy Domine!
11,01You never know.
I was doing good just going back and playing FFIV, FFV, FFVI
4Yep...
oh no, this is Learning to Fly...
YELLOW
12Was Razz a noob? I wasn't here that long ago XD
That's hubris if ever I saw it.
huh, guess I'm remembering wrong
05this is a 3 hour acid trip
YELLOW EVERYWHERE
best concert ever, period
...and how far in are we >_>
^
0515 minutes
we need to go deeper
xD
:D
....i need something too drink
Best part?
11,01Honestly, my opinion is one-sided.
Be right back my fellow Ponies
I dont not like it
At least Rift had the dignity to price itself lower than WoW.
I mean
I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS SHIT
TOR? nope.avi
Okay..
I'll be back later I can't listen to this whilst my modem is fucking up
The problem I have is that their songs are long. I don't like anything over 5 minutes.
12ah
LIKE A BOSS
4I'm still friends with Razz. :P
05I also have a few aerosmith and metallica concerts lyign around, if there's any interest anotehr night
Very...Very Long.
11,01Sony shouldn't have the right to fucking take features from my console and limit it's activations under firmware updates.
Hah, is she any different? :P
/me considers starting acid for tis
/me doesn't like it when ponies don't have good taste in music
Oh, don't worry about me. I, uh, have KOTOR. Just haven't played it
05also I hope you can forgive me headphone users
popcorn!!!
I'm thinking of getting one again, its 8 bucks at gamestop. and Its been a while since I played.
4Not really. :T I guess... she takes offense sometimes... still fan-crazy over Elora... :P
05dont know straight fro my head
05ill look it up
4Yep...
How old are you now anyway?
lol air
my ears are already dying
Because they think TOR *is* KOTOR.
streams are like taxis, you wait hours for one, and 3 arrive at once
x3
there is where you can get KotoR
4Almost thirteen... 7th grade...
Whut we wtachin >.>
Hah, been a while...
4Yeah...
that's why it feels weird
05I AM THE STUD IN STUPID
4I now have a girlfriend. :P My first...
I am the TWIT in Twitter
12IRL?
I put the I in team
Wait...
08,14I am ready.
4Nope. :T
12ah
4I hope eventually...
not really, I don't use Twitter, fuck that noise if you excuse my language
05<3
12same thing if you ask me
As for me, I was originally looking forward to a lot of games. Currently that list has been culled down to one. GW2.
12derp
4People keep saying we're a good couple... :P
-.-
I am the terror, that FLAPS in the NIGHT!
I AM
05oh-tay.KHAN
oh
lol
I was going to play TOR until they declared a Pay-To-Play model
lol
Then I stopped caring
I am the bait in taliban
http://james0the0mad.deviantart.com/#/d4pizys i just made this tell me if you like it :):)
05i have been enjoying rift latley
i'm here.
wats STO?
05star trek online
Star Trek Online
lol, never noticed that dr
oh
05ninjad
lol
damn it
STO is pretty entertaining if you got someone to play with
I am looking forward to GW2
only 23 more days!~
But I was also looking forward to Warhammer. That was sad.
didn't it wreck?
._.
4Nope... TV show...
I am the 'fense' guarding defense
Hated Twiste Metal..
:P
Vigilante 8 <3
12which one?
um no
its a sequel
to guild wars
....
damn it, the WAIT for ME3 is literally killing me
/me is the reason you can't see in the room
I CAN'T WAIT NEARLY TWO WEEKS!
it DOES
thanks!
12:'D
I can't WAIT
and guild wars is boring... like most MMO's
4Heh... It's a Nickelodeon show...
05JUMP!!!
XD
they added jumping
OMG
Actually, I couldn't care less about jumping.
05he's epic on the steel guitar
4I'm talking about PoM...
ugh. Mothership Zeta
I don't know that abbreviation
My cousin couldn't stop talking about it
I liked the weapons, the story of it I didnt very much enjoy though.
oh wait, thats a GOOD thing
4Penguins of Madagascar... Heh... :T
Oh
12That show isn't childish p:
OK.
4Yeah... I know it isn't...
I'm pretty sure I've seen an episode of it before.
4Some people find it stupid, though...
4I watch it all the time.
WoW was fine in the day. With anything I play, once you complete the content... move on
bipolar
ADD
i can't stand dirtiness i start getting all itchie
I have a cronic fear of Spiders.
ditto
^ same
12You have nothing to worry about as long as it's not on PBS
Snakes are ok, I live in arizona, but spiders scare the -YAY- Out of me.
/me RUNS
oh man. One day I rushed into a dungeon in Skyrim (which I never do) and a spider came on top of me. The only thing in Skyrim that scared me
05so much people!
10 Int + Skill Book Perk + Extra Skill Points Perk=maxed skills
4Yeah...
Oh nice
aCID
ACID
4^Same...
Yes, there is a mod to turn spiders in wacky Spidermans
I'm in the UK. :P
4PBS is a kids channel dedicated to learning...
eh not all kids related
:p
I'd be more scared of a crazy spiderman running at me then a spider itself.
4Most of the time...
Like Fluttershy, I don't like to be scared :(
Oh, shows like Dora the Explorer.
because being startled can be quite startling
Speaking of which.
4No... :P
08,14Gut~
I want one of these rigs in my room
/me brushes Princess_Luna's mane
4Shows like CyberChase...
Thank you...keep brushing...
1212PM-5PM Kids shows, 6PM-11AM other
/me keeps brushing
brushy brushy
yay~
oh, it's not a problem
because LUNA
4Yeah...
12it turns into KRWG when it's not playing kids shows
4That's the only thing I can really watch when I'm home sick. :P
...let me rephrase that
I'll brb
hangon. My cat is acting up again
/me needs caffeine
12same thing though
my brothers cat is named opalescence

IZZY! Stop! ... don't eat my legos!
especially with the collar
WIsh I had a brushable pony
>_<
Even have my main planned out. :3
I am a pony...and brushable...
4Yeah...
Vault 34 was difficult for me. Too much radiation.
I'm around. Ping me once there's movement.
It's fun to brush
He is still streaming
12I do wish PBS had some anime though
Its PonyKin...PONYBORN!
Because low battery.
4I watch 4Kids for that...
/me loves being brushed
I got into the first chapter and it seems nice already
Are we watching UFOs?
Good!
yeah... Horizons has taken a turn for the silly the past 2 chapters, though it isn't entirely unwarranted
12I watch Cartoon network, 4Kids, and some Adult swim
No need to yell..
Sorry...
It's okay :)
But I thought THIS WAS YELLINGA! Whoops...
Kitty is out of food. Isabel wants more, but I have to buy more.
12oh, and the hub
/me is not old. 22 is a fine age

4The Hub is awesome... too bad it got removed from my catalog...
4>.>
/me is 27
27 and still awesome!
/me is 14
well technically, you can't disagree with the fact that this music is putting me to sleep

hmm
/me is over 1000, enough said.
my parents don't know jack shit about music :(

And aging gracefully.

I'm going too give a forecast of the story, eventually the main pony is going too be kicked out of , or escape the vault/whatever its called.
yikes
arrrrg
Am I right?
Ya
/me brushes Princess_Luna's mane slowly
gannon beat me
/me murmuring, falling asleep

/me readies $1500 to secure that plush
are you watching the grammies
<_>
*sigh* none of these shirts do me.
Listen guys: There has been NO reputable announcements on the length or content of Season 3. Could be 13 eps. Could be 26. Could be 4 TV movies. Could be just 10 straight hours of Rarity and FLuttershy giving the audience increasingly amorous looks. We have NO confirmation on any of this.

it's not IN THE OFFICIAL RULES PAGE YET THOUGH, HINT HINT!

well got to go everypony once more srry about getting anyone in a work :$ i bet season 3 is all fine :$ see yall later
this dudes really good
why don't we have an accoustic pony?
accoustic playing pony*
I like the audio books.
/me I dont smoke But I have a zippo :3
Easier too read.
I mean in the show itslef
a cannon
oh good point
I never liked the whole pony&pony romance thrown in everywhere either. Just something people do I guess.
/me is not intentionly spelling things wrong :(
But ya
personally, I think it'd be a good end to the show as a whole if we got a 13 ep Season, and then a TV movie to act as a capstone to the whole hurrah.
i think this dude is a damn good singer:D
dem grammys?
If anything, just show them in 2parts like the season openers
^
Those 4 episodes alone are in my top 10
I still say Season 2 operner should have been a three parter
i agree with unfoundbug...it must never end
no where near enough luna yet
guys lets face it
when it is about to end, we must take over
and continue it
Hi everypony.
No it needs to end sometime
is this finally over
for the toys
The problem I face is that each episode is treated as a stand-alone episode. There is no progression between the episodes (or very little to notice)
no its not
05im already workign on g5 ones xD
just not TONS of it
its lost its appeal ever since the movie
Simpsons has been going on twice as long as it ever should have.
Like the Luna episode... everyone was freaking out except Twilight. Seriously? Twilight was the only sane one?
is going to be over anytime soon

lol
mmmm...cheese
dat stretch
For instance, her verse on Kanye West's "Monster" is pretty good.
:D
Kanye frustrates me when it comes to his music. He can produce some absolutely fantastic music when he's doing the sound mix, but he is a sub-par rapper most of the time.
Spent $45 on chips and dips and soda

04DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
wait, who's the tech/mechanic?
lmao
Rhy's the mechanic then?
04Yeah
dunno
because see
Rhy needs to know about mechanics
because aircraft
04obviously
04mechanics != electronics
well
though it'd be mainly Rhy still
and I suppose Rhy would bitch if they did anything she didn't like
04like weapons, armor etc.
Well sure
04Anywho
04First mission
yeah
but not something huge like murdering a president or anything
04Encroaching on neighbouring territory?
encroaching?
04Messing up a communication outpost?
04Like, setting up something on land not actually owned by you.
04LIke Russia setting up a com outpost in US soil.
Well
04I figured the first mission
04Would be
I don't think our first mission should be long
04Us three and some back up
04Find a US com outpost
er
finding
whatever
04Because breaking it and leaving doesn't help. They'll just fix it.
04Hired by China, the US thinks Russia broke the outpost but doesn't have definite proof.
04Things start stirring up between the two nations.
I thought you said you wanted Russia and US to be on the same team
therefore it'd make sense for us to break into the outpost as chinese-dressed people and China pinned as the culprits
though
it wouldn't make sense
04Exactly
for military people sneaking/breaking in
to be dressed as their nation
04Us and RUssia start hating each other but by the end they realise China/Japanw as behind it
well
04somehow
04I dunno
I wasn't talking about the culprit not making sense
but the sneaking/breaking in
somehow we'd have to leave behind proof
accidental
04?*
04That isn't solid enough proof for retaliation
That's way too careless
any china-specific/russia-specific bullets?
04Probably.
or weaponry
find some
04Weaponry definitely
that'd be good enough
and it wouldn't seem like it's done on purpose
04Leave behind a pistol
no
bullets should be enough
but if we have to
no fingerprints though
04When you're in a combat zone
but for guns it's a bit blunky
clunky
04Not really
04Unless Nathan's sniping
04Which he won't be
they'll go in through the ventilation
They drop on the surprised US fags
and kill them
then Nathan comes back BAWWWWWWWWWWWing
and Rhy's like "I lost my innocence, and not to Nathan either"
XD
04XD
04Nathan won't be like that
04He just won't kill at first
yeah well
04Then second or third mission
there has to be trauma
04have to kill someone
well
04Then comes the angst
they can't kill everyone I suppose
that'd be too much
for a mission like that
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9x18mm_Makarov
04Soviet bullet
04awesome
;o
if they kill too many people it'll be bad
04For a pistol as well
04Exactly
/me hides
awesome
04it's covert mission
04not a kill everyone on sight mission
Yeh
Yeah
I suppose they'll just murder everyone in the main control room
04Break a few thingsw
04So it's not suspicious
where the three of them fuck up the electronics while the other teams go for the generator
04And then plant the bomb and run
and yeah
generator blows up
but the control room should remain somewhat intact
04NS
and the guys remain intact
04they aren't destroying the base
04They're damaging it
04Because blowing it up is kind of suspicious
04Plus the US would then enter a panic
well
it'd make sense to damage the generator at least
04Don't blow it up though
yeah
two-team mission
04Our team goes for the control tower, the other team does the generator
yeah
we all use the Makarov bullets
but she's not carving them up or anything
04yeah
04Slit their throat when they aren't looking
just disabling them long enough to not be a threat
yeah, that'd be okay to do
04Rhy would still be nervous about killing for the first time mind you
well
04But she'd be over it by the end of the mission
I don't think she'd try to kill
just wound enough to disable them
until Leo's hammers them with bullets
at least at the beginning
until the control room
yeah
04So she's like "Oh...well, ok"
04k
And you're not well, you shouldn't be missing out on sleep.
But yes, I need to sleep. Cya later.
back
knock knock
XELI
/me hugs
~
/me cling
/me huuuuuuugs
have been talking non-stop
04hi
/me hugs
/me hugs back
04was playing BF3
04and I despise it
04a lot
04I mean
04I see an enemy
lmao
anyway
04It's bullshit
>:
/me hugs
04I used to get 12 K/8 Deaths
04But now I'm, for some reason, up against 12 Prestige players
04Which means they've completed the ranking system 12 times
.-.
well
good luck
can't help you there
wait
does battlanfield have
prestiges
04apparently
04I asked my friend about it
o_O
04Because I can't kill anyone
except bf2
and bf3
04I can't get he Famas
04the
second mission?
And aw
and is the first mission in daytime or night?
04Night
it makes more sense at daytime
04Alright then
I just envisioned it that way for some reason
Rhy'll get one later
04Will the guy's grudge be personal or professional?
06ACE COMBAT.jpg
04Espeon
06:3
04Where do you think all this inspiration is coming from LOL
06Exactry
04It's got some insanely good tracks
lmao
I doubt it'd be personal
professional
04Aww 'kay
04So
04"YOU BEAT MY RECORD! FUCK YOU!?
04Or something similar
yeah lmfao
personal
would be waaaay too coincidental
04Fair enough
04Well
well
I'd more over say that he's impressed
and wants to beat her
04fair enough
yeah
06So pretty much hunting the glory or whatever for taking her down
06makes sense
04Dem pilots have a lot of rivalry between the,
04them*
04she's like
/me runs
lmao
she's like
"NATHAAAAAAAAAAN GET THIS BASTARD OFF MY TAIL!!!!!!!"
04No not really XD
04"Can you get him close?"
04"Yeah but...what are you planning?"
04"Get him over here, up close. I've got a plan."
he uses a bazooka
04Sniper rifle to the cockpit.
04Bad
04ass
XD
well
imo Rhy should shoot him down
at the end
not Nathan
04I never said it was Rhy's rival
since it's her archnemesis essentially
you said
Rhy needs a rival
04Meaning
but her rival
alright
that makes more sense
04It's not going to be 1v1 the whole climax
yeah of course not
And fuck yeah
[20:24:11] <Drake> she's like
04XD
04Leo
She'll be like
XD
then she accidentally blows something up
and then shows Rhy how to use it
Nathan'll just be like "oh snap owned"
/me shrugs
Hm
04Indie being the CEO of the entire corporation
04Still don't have a name for the corporation as a whole though
yeah
04An offshoot of Zastava?
or story name
lolwut
04XD
XD
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zastava_Arms
04Maybe not
04It's Serbian
04Xeli i saw that TF2 topic on TST finally and now I'm playing TF2
04curses
you fail
and nawwwwwwwwww
Canada's a bit of a strange place
but I imagine it'll be their "home" in a sort of way
And Rhy'll be complaining about the cold
04Canada isn't where the HQ is
well
HQ is in US then?
04It's just where we've been allocated living quarters
actually that makes no sense
04Sure.
not US
Afghanistan?
04Russia
04Russia
04YES
XD
/me loves that name
...you're going to get Rhy pregnant?
06what
04fuck no
/me slaps NS
04I meant
XD
04Maybe Indie's right-hand-woman
sure
Rhy hates her
Nathan swoons over her
Rhy bitchslaps him
04Sweet
and eventually kills her
04Esther is Indie's daughter
Alright
Well
we'll say that Rhy hates her while Nathan thinks she's pretty
04yay sexual tension
She's a conceited and arrogant bitch
quite cold-hearted and merciless
04I was imagining something more along the lines of a femme fatale, shy, but cold and merciless
04Which is why Indie warns Nathan to stay away from her.
04That causes a bit of tension between Rhy and Nathan later on
Well
04Then after 3/4 the way through the story, Nathan's like "Fuck that bitch"
2/3
3/4's a bit too close to the end
<Drake> Which is why Indie warns Nathan to stay away from her.
Yeah
04Imagine...hmm
04What's the character I'm looking for...
That ga-whatever person
from VCS?
04no
04no way
I'd go for Giovanni
Slade's personality wouldn't suit a mercenary organization
it's more like Giovanni's personality
04Alright then
I see
XD
MUST HAVE
04That's why i mentioned the Japanese Naval Base
04perfect SM setting
XD
04Also
04NS
?
04What city has a lot of towers?
04Not just really tall ones
...sydney?
XD
04Like, a lot of towersthroughout the city.
Antarctica?
04London
04nah
04New York is too overused
04Chicago?
/me has a look
Dubai?
04Oooh
http://goitaly.about.com/od/sangimignano/p/sangimignano.htm

MEDIEVAL WALLS
04...
04We need to go there
yes
04SCOOT
04That was fun
06:3
06brb i need foooodss
04k
XD
/me hugs Xeli too
/me hugs back
/me hugs both. Somehow
04Magic
XD
GROUP HUGS
we need to go to that place in italy
OR
Versailles
WE SHOULD GO THERE
04o-o
04Why?
because
WALLS
06whut
XD
04:I
:U
/me hugs back
04Anyway
04What should happen between the first and second mission?
04I want most character development to happen in those interims.
06hm
06and now I imagine that thank you
04XD
Yeah
06But yeah.
Nathan does get bothered
especially when he has to kill
Rhy on the other hand
isn't really bothered
or as much
04It's after the second or third mission that Nathan really starts getting disturbed by the lives he is taking.
yeah
he doesn't kill until the 2nd or 3rd mission
06So yeah.
Well
Leo's been in the company for at least 3 years
before he found Rhy and Nathan
04yeah
04But using a .50 on a person is overkill x10
yeah
Rhy doesn't really care I suppose
well
aka kill or be killed
sorta like Kommander Kulesz/The Hensh
except they're more philosophically based
04Why he survives when the people he has to kill don't, whether they might have had families etc.
That's not philosophical
that's the "if"s
which are not worth thinking about
which Rhy constantly tells him
04But Nathan can't help but keep thinking of it because he's such a pussy and all
/me shot
lmao
04But nah, he's just a generally more thoughtful person than Rhy, which is why it takes her verbally beating him senseless to make him understand.
Yeah
and why she's developed a habit of doing that to everyone
because she lives around Nathan
makes sense
:D
06So does this mean
06Rhy is the dominant one in this relationship?
/me hides
04of course
04Just like NS and I
/me runs
lmao
06:3
:o
04yeah
yeah well
in between we don't need too much detail
04I'd rather not
04A few chapters per interim
04Then like, 7 chapters per mission
well I meant that
most of the things we describe
04Again
04but alright
and some interims
we're not going to have an interim after EVERY mission
04Yes we are >:|
04And no, character dev won't be mostly in training
04we are not having static characters throughout it.
of course not idiot
04Which, IMO is the most important part of a story
04Obviously
and then psychological changes begin in missions
04But that's not character development
or at least half of it
04That's physical change
psychological you idiot
not physical
/me facepalms
you know, emotional, philosophical, etc.?
well
they're being taught how to handle guns
04Anyway
04I need to go
and weapons
04Bed now
and how to kill people
etc.
/me hugs NS and Xeli
I'm pretty sure
04So?
04They're kids
04They're naive
Yes
04Of course they change
they're 15
like us
04But they don't become killers or hardened mercenaries
04fuck
04I have to go
04bye
:\

^
not too sure
you can
requires adding it as a folder to mIRC's server list though
I dont use mIRC's server list
you might be able to do add it to the serverlist
/server -a irc.server.net -p port -g Group "-w User:Pass"(If applicable) -d Description
you don't need -p
lol
AND YOU FUCKIN KNOW WHY TOO!!! ;p
fucking bastard needs to start being active
But the thing is, that it auto changes the network name
to the name the network says its name is
whats the perks of having a bouncer XD
Always there, always watching
autoidentification via the BNC, having it connected 24/7
getting playback buffers
etc.
Also its the best way to winrar at idlerpg
plus fun features
lmao
hmm..i doubt i'd need one but eh
BNC is like idleRPG cheatcode
I need to set up idlerpg here

Dang, Italian opening grows on you
I never got friendzoned, I just got rejected.
I think I'm just going to go to sleep early, or something.
Please stop with the links.
I didn't really get friendzoned. I knew I was there and went for it anyway. All I got in return was "I'm sorry"
I never got anything because I never went looking for it. Go figure.
lalalala!
Ummm....
Stop the links please.

its valentines day?
glomps?
No need for a cure. NO cancer
11,01I'm pretty much the happiest I've been in years.
00,03^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A glomp is a combination of tackle and hug
11,01From having friends and managing stress.
Cancer is not the focus anymore; We don't need to cure what's not there
A glomp is a hug at speed
00,03Can I share soemthing with you guys? Since this seems like the appropriate moment?
but i'm never sad
Let us never speak of that again

Let me finish my speech folks.

Hello.
/me sighs "Fine....."
Which is a crime as bad as murder.
she told me we could still be friends i told her she was a b***h and to f**k off.
Wheere the strams at.
I'm not going to fit into society. I am my own person ^__^
yet i was pretty much immediately accepted
Mee, too
irl
Friendzone shenanagins got me down, and whatnot.
http://www.rainymood.com/ Let's all listen to this at the same time
I'm a very isolated person because when I see the stupidity and atrocities of society, I can't help but grow disgusted.
haven't talked to her ever since.
how's it going?
i wish we were still together.:(
Jack of all trades, master of none... or no one cares to use you for
okay, brb need MOAR COFFEE!
I'm not much of a worrywort, to be honest
/me slowly wakes up and looks around
Hey guys.
Hai
good!
sometimes my "bloodlust" as i refer to it, can get really high
The worst nights are where you just lie awake thinking about how much you suck and how many thing you have done wrong
ouch...
HUZZAH!
the fun has been doubled!
^
Yup
lol
I just want to move on
Damn...you all are describing me...

"Rainy Mood Loves You" hahaha just noticed that
i suppose i'm weird in the relationship department, i see a lot of people, many of them perfectly good looking people. yet i do not find them attractive at all, at least not physically
^
i'm usually the type to go for mental and personalty over phsyical
Anyone see Oh My Goddess? Yeah...
Oh Goodness
theres this girl in my 4th period shes shy and doesn't talk much i like her but i am too ashamed to tell her how i feel.
Just do it
DO IT
brb
:D
ok
I'm weird
I like Rarity the best
Rarity always surprises me
Yep
Applejack = Best
Definitely the most complex.
Sadly, I would find Applejack ... intimidating?
but she talks to my ex and she probably told her about our breakup.
Rarity kind of grew on me; I did not like her at first
Because all of us are bosses....
seems wierd but reminds me of seeing one of farmer's daughters around where i live...
HOT DAMN!
Squiggletail is an ok pony.
lol
because IRC is such a diiferent environment to face to face
I've always been wary about telling someone about how I feel about them
the one I marry would be my best friend... when I get some friends
nice
Ooof.
i haven't had a single date or even a crush...is that bad?
diabetes incoming!!
I still see her regularly and it really bugs me
