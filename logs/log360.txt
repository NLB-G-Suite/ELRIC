its why i'm up now, adjusting a little for tomorow
today
tomorow

*derp*
surprised you didn't just get dari-trolled there
6 messeges in 10 seconds = kick
line'
hyh
huh'
stream still paused?
just does
not sure, but the kick is based on the timestamps on dari's local machine
dari netsplits are allways fun
yeah...
which is why i've been telling him his script needs more leeway
hai thar guys :3
wait... you guys are all going to sleep right now, aren't you?
lol
eeeenope

It's 14:35 here.
Yes. Yes we are.
yeah, early afternoon
color/colour
You're coming.
Now.
(giggity)
I'm coming.
all over the place.
lol ogawd
in every city and every town
where else am I supposed to put my mind?
The Swedish are coming?
Brace yourself
my mind is in both.
nice!!!
05...
my top hat is in fact, also a gutter.
"Hello my baby! Hello my darlin'! Hello my rag time gal~!"
|I want a top hat now though
I wish I knew where to buy top hats.
me too...
a costume store at a minimum
but I want a nice one
I want a freindship top hat
and then went back to lurking
The Swedish -are- coming!
07[08:36:10] <Wrek> 05...01
errr...

yes.
whoops
There's not long until satudray
didn't realize my clipboard pulled formatting
color?
how
?
and id on't know - i just copy/pasted a line
and evidently it preserved formatting, including color
its very discouraging
Lobsters?
yes lobsters
lobsters.
lol
meh.
Oh my
Oh, Goddesses.
i dislike the EqD people
3 screens, 1-Minecraft, 2-This & 3-TV
they are kind of jerks
watching TVB pearl now, the movie is weird atm
such as... nah, not going there
05probably gona catch up my missed zero punctuation vids
05then maybe play i dunno... wow or rift or any other mmo...
!cd
:3
05sure
-_-
seems legit.
apparently he raised over a thousand dollars
although that's probably an exaggeration
That's... insanely stupid.
evidently there were a handful of $100+ donations
Humanity never fails to depress, doesn't it?
*does it
people evidently really like him...
hang on; he's posted videos about this
I honestly can't see why
inb4 the fbi raids his place
People like him, but he shouldn't abuse his position by asking for donations
he doesn't even write his own instrumentals
hello\
...
*sigh*
daribot knows...
I just spent 8 hours of my sleep time repairing my xbox.
Ouch.
@_@
oh dear...
Finally got my disc drive to work again.

05seriously this community has way too many douchebags

05"top famous" people that is
Oh, I see.
i agree
Eh, that'll always happen.
like "first" commentor?
"walks over to the walmart cashier and pulls out a gun, give me the ponies or somebody is gonna die"
lol
I need more ponies!
Ghehe.
I don't much like his vids, if I'm honest.
they're okay
I think he does a great job
Mrponiatoris sometimes good sometimes weird
school and whatnot
see ya
I don't really like sexjokes. And most of his vids are sexjokes. :P
I'm gonna go now guys
>Have fun
>at school
give or take the animations he does with all the exams, classes, and homework is pretty damn good.
just do eet
find a way
That's why I said 'find him funny' :P
It's not my style. No biggie.
I like the references he tends to make
omfg my inspiration came back!
thank lambofGOD

8 sleepless hours well spent if you ask me.

The bones are strong in this one...
05did you OD on calcium dari?
XD
Milk is alright, I guess.
Think it's 510% of the daily calcium

Cold milk > all.
Milk is best used for tea.
Cold milk is delicious alone
05its ok dari, you'll jsut piss out the ammount the body doesnt absorb
i allways find it strange when someone i was awake to see go to sleep wakes up befor i go to sleep
timezones r confuse
He said this:
<Phase4> i allways find it strange when someone i was awake to see go to sleep wakes up befor i go to sleep
<Phase4> timezones r confuse
^ that
I'm still dissapoint that I haven't had a dream about hugging fluttershy yet.
Y U NO WORK DREAMS?
^
I never want to dream about ponies ever.
You can't control dreams
Because waking up would be too depressing.
I^

Accidental I is accidental.
i = sqrt(-1)
05(yes its practicable)

But I didn't actually meen the square root of 1.
No, 'i' is a letter.
DO HO HO
:P
mean*
O U
I do dream about ponies.
But I don't remember my dreams well enough.
is it e^(i*Pi) or (e^i)*Pi
or go rape someone
05my dreams are funnily enough in high FX HD
in the dream of course
the second one
xD
Pahse4: e^(i*Pi) sry
Dreams are best when you're sick.
I ain't old enough to understand much D:

When I figured out I was dreaming, I jumped into the ocean and drowned in under five seconds. T_T
Secondary 4 here, anyone?

Dari, do u have the guts to try that again?
05last zero punctuatiopn vid now
There is no dinosaur.

Stream yourself doing chores
I really hate when my dreams JUST getting good I hear a "TIME TO GET UP Trollface.jpg"
That's fantastic.
owait.
NIGHT.
inb4 another inb4
It's weird when you wake up from a deram, and then fall asleep and resume the same dream.
dream*
I should be on for BMN, not sure.
I wouldn't know, really. I don't do drugs.
05i do that all the time dari, though sometimes fails if i stayed awake for too long in between
in the dream, you don't think it's weird, but when you wake up, you do
Not even when I had the flu.
I'm ready for the stream!
I hadonce
When you resume a dream after waking up, I still didn't remember that the dream was a dream though.
and yes*
I wasn't speaking Latin there. I just had a typo.
Even though I knew it was a dream just a few minutes ago.
It's weird.
that is weird
i can top that though
feelsbatman.png
:P
I remember mine very faintly for like, 10 minutes.
one time the last thing i saw in a dream was my babysitter, and when I woke up she was still in my vision. I could see my room, but she was floating there too. Then she faded away in blocks.
>dream about brushing teeth
>wake up
>think already brushed teeth
I like those dreams that don't make any sense after you wake up.
Why is there no stream yet?!
05so i keep drinking for a while
/me has never had a dream that made sense
05cause i was still thristy when i woke up
{08:01:16} <~Armageddon> where do we come in?
you c- >'night
05imagine someone crying in sinus curves.
dammit.
Sine curves are sad
Has anyone this weird one-second-Dreams where you dream you walk then trip and then wake up?
I don't get why dreams have to be such trolls though.
and they allways happen in the middle of the night
ALWAYS when something good is about to happen
Wake up.
that has happened to me more than once
at least in the ones i can remember that had a rational end
Pinged mahself. :3
lol i found that cute
i'ma go bet time now. gnight

I think it is, he said he would be streaming it
he said either rift or skyrim
and this is not skyrim
I don't like the camera angle, but that I suppose is because we can't see the entire screen

Sleep is for the weak.
Time you enjoy wasting is not time wasted
enjoyment doesn't pay the bills
sleep is for the sleepy

having a job means humans around me all day long
naaaah
Unless you work with animals
ok...animals are cool
'cause I'm pretty sure half of my co-workers are apes
you need a job in the zoo then :P

Are you receiving? Can you feel me? The information that you're seeking, a sensation that is sneaking, has you reaching for the ceiling. There's no fighting, the igniting. This reciting is inviting.

BOOKS
...Sorry.
Radu, did you know molestias means problem in spanish?
...really?
Me Gusta
yes really
'Molestias' translates to "discomfort".
i knew that earlier today
when you switch to spanish it says hwjq kdk skq Molestias
With dat :/ face
well the first part is wrong
but it does say molestias
Coincidentally, 'molestias' is also used by the "Lorem ipsum" thing.
:D
Actually, 'molestias' is in Spanish the plural of 'molestia', which means anything from problem to bother to annoyance to discomfort.
coincidence i think not
It derives from the Latin word of the same name.
hiya guys, what's up?
I think mIRC is using an English keyboard layout on me again.
£
I'm just going to restart mIRC.
Again.

10,02hai :3
05hmm
Hello everypony
Hi Radu
NO THE EVIL NAVIS
05i have a shitload of work to finish
Radu: It's odd, really. In Latin, the word for molestation is the same as for annoyance and dislike.
Rain:*
Goddammittabkey
Perhaps in the dictionary, molest has a reference to the Spanish word
Which derives from the Latin word of the same name.
wait
Rain: Weren't you the one talking about it?
05yes otty
and hi Rain
whats that arrow right next to issacs hoove
What's it saying there?
05its a personal note
Oh
05says "fix it"
Rain: Aha.
It's all because of my silly tab key and my tendency to use it even for 4-letter names.
05hmm
05?
05xD
Don't have the cash, myself.
We got to have MONEEEEH.
How much is it? 40$?

I didn't read them
05so is stream working?

Yup, nice concert right there

05cause people are ALWAYS complete idiots untill proven otehrwise

05trolls are idiots on purpose

05but yeah
Not literally, but yeah.

What's on then?
Watching the stream? But I still have 39 chapters left!
05kammer
66 chapters doesn't seem that long, really.
05if you arent watching

I wasn't pairing yooou, I was just mixing names
I'm partial to prince-tennant.

prince-Smith
Raimica
inb4 dari comes and kicks me to the moooonaaaahhh

/me raises his hand.
05he's awesome
05and DIre straits ofc
Yeah.
yfw I have no mouse plugged in, and I'm trying to live without the mouse
Sultans Of Swing
beastly song.
nosey little wench likes sticking her face where it doesn't belong
Money for Nothing is great as well
0,14Another great song
05my fav dire straits song ought to be telegraph road extended end solo version
/me does not hear the audio
ooh Dire Straits
although that opinion tends to change every other day
/me is amused with the lights
Ha I like you guys you all have awesome taste in music
this song is making me feel sleepy
This song is making me hungry.
I dunno why, but when I hear Kammerjunk's nick I think of hammers
Or maybe that's the lack of food.
10,02Suddenly, buffer
Yup.
ill be back *you just read that as Arnold*
/me turns up volume
Radu: I can't imagine why.
:O
/me regrets turning off the mute
how anyone can like that cacophony is beyond me
I hate this music
quite literally
Then don't complain, really.
Then mute and begone with you.
:)
stop complaining or leave
xD
fine
We don't need to know you completely HATE this music, perhaps HATE is a strong word.
I see
You just really really really really really dislike it.
I dislike the instrumentalisation
Dose lights :3
I dislike the light effects
05love and tolerate the guitarrs
0,14^
I dislike the costumes
For instance, I dislike Eminem.
I'm a musician. I'm a percussionist. I really hate the percussion part in this piece
/me drops the subject and walks on
c'mon
just mute it if you don't like it
I guess you have a point
aw bye MT
Radu: mine?
Yes
aka, classical
05ever since then he's been cranking those speakers
:)
if you dislike it, don't listen to it
it's very simple
/me hopes she isn't in the doghouse for also having it muted because of having a headache
0,14nah, it's cool
I really should agree
It's just
that when I had PF muted
ding
I was accused of sinning
hence the discussion
.1% *
here's a refreshing change, I said I didn't like it, I have it on mute, and I'm not discussing it...
I'm not quite sure you get the concept of a 'joke'.
05Ponygirl82 its cool
okay, brb need to make my PIZZA
I just like to take jokes literally, for fun
yikes
I do!
I do
10,02So yeah, this song needs to be one of my background themes everywhere I go.
joke (noun): something not to be taken seriously : a trifling matter
but they are good
Sure.
thanks
If I remember it, that is.
See you in 3 hours.
05dis song<3
10,02I'm off to take my nap now after having this sound therapy O__O
dream of ponies
can't you mute it and leave it running whilst you sleep?
I don't really think its that much of a problem, just something I've noticed
05posted that earlier radu
10,02The point is, pausing it in the middle of this song.
Oh, really?
05yeah
05if i werent streaming id relink
oh ok
okay
yeah, don't take it as though I was criticizing anyone for only knowing that album
The chorus. The chorus!
well it felt a bit "If you only know this one really famous album then you are not cool enough like the rest of us"
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw293_what_is_a_pony.jpg
xD
I deserve that.
but then again I dont' really feel that strong about music
Radu: That does not compute.
Why not
Pinkie Pie solves it
aha
lol
I listen to it as often and as much as I can.
Guitars can speak notes
okay I'll unmute and put it on quiet
Dat Wah-wah. :3
or at least I think he is
ooh fps games <3
I'm not watching the stream atm, I'm only listening to it
i thought his guitar would this noises XD

Then you haven't read MLD yet, George.
I wrote a fanfiction of two ponies kissing each other
Also, mfw my second name is also George
05its breathe
Oh, yeah.
yep.
I just have Speak To Me/Breathe on my playlist
those two ponies were mickey rooney and judy garland
right...XD
rarity is best pony
mick foley is best pony
wth did you drink last night?
05as i said george, stay with us, forget the cloppers
Dem lights <3
thats not about ponies kissing
Everyone of you desservers a kiss D :
Hello.
kiss from a boy? lol no thanks
you mean flapper like the flapper women from the roaring 20s?
oh you homophobic e.e
Which makes sense, she's my favourite pony.
hahaha dx
DING
Followed by Trixie, but that's besides the point.
zuul
00,10Reminds me of a bit from Cowboybebop now
Wait, what's homophobia again?
the fear of gay people
extreme closeupXD
O
dahah
ooh this is a bit psychadelic
then kiss me : /
Radu: homophobia (noun): An extreme and irrational aversion to homosexuality and homosexual ponies.
am i high
weird, but it is artistic
straight = not gay = boy+girl
normally it is a fear held by people that are uncomfortable with their sexuality
and they may fear that a gay person can turn them gay
Not a fag? Must be fag
homophobic people annoy me.
or they are hardcore religious
Seems legit
mostly because I have to deal with homophobes on a regular basis.
pf.. whatever.. *kiss mateo^* e.e
1994.
oooo
did the streamer get us high
puaj, get off u gay >: /
I admit with shame I have a bad habit of using the word 'gay' to mean 'lame' I really need to stop it. I am not homophobic and have many many gay and lesbian friends I view as equals but its a bad vocabulary thing
yea.....
Tbh, I never swore IRL
well, i usually don't get offended if you use gay as lame
05Im sure
lol
LOL
epic explotion!
Because insulting the majority is like throwing yourself in a hellpit
aww yeah, Time.
05how to properly insult someone: insult their intelect in a way they themselves do not understand.
time
xD
use sarcasm
ftw
Use Latin.
or use insults from the 50's
hm yea right, todos ustedes son una manga de no saber español
hm must turn sound on this UP it is pissing off my neighbour :D
jaj, yo te entiendo tontito
goddamn chowderhead
lol
Reggae version of Time
I must have this.
damn, forgot you speak spanish e.e
now.
even if its like midday and really quiet
he's a total tool
Oh yes, this song too.
05derp
ding
13Kammerjunk: that which is said in latin appears profound
Dat CTRL+V
yeah....
omg listen to him, throwing a tantrum now, screaming and hammering on things. Get a grip douchebag
George Lopez: Molestias
that is all
Did Pixar animate this?
I have to listen to ponystream with headphones because he throws a tantrum about that too
05the lyrics are epic on this one
for 1994 this looks amazing
techically it was trying to be realistic, it's just that people had lower standards back then
For example, if they call you something, tell them that "ne supra crepidam sutor iudicarat."
if a pony kisses a non pony its zoophilic
the alblum;
05told a douchebag at school he has an oedipus complex.
05he replied with "thank you!"
I got dc'd
Hmm, Pity. can't sleep like this
nvm
I'm back

This should be Rarity's themetune XD j/k
lol yeh
Rarity isn't rich.
she likes money though
I remember I heard that tune somewhere.
Yes, but it's not canon
...yet
technically Applejack likes it more
1,3haven't listened to this song in such a long time
^
^@Sundaysmile
05rarity is a custom dressmaker, she makes more than any other of them
Applejack likes work whether or not it involves money
05guaranteed
When I was a kid I used to watch this concert at least one time per week
I think Pinkie did it for free
can you imagine if Derpy babysat the twins?
derpy +10
Rainbow works on the weather team, doesn't she?
1,3Rainbow Dash is the weather pony for the town
Money <3
dis solo...
actually, derpy would be good at babysitting twins, she could keep her eyes on both of them at once :P
she buys enough writing supplies to suggest she has money to spare
Rainbow dash?
Twilight has been mooching off welfare ever since she thought she contracted horn rot
Twilight = Student loan :P
Twilight = moocher

05more or less yes
Wow. 300 dollars per month. 10 dollars per day
Not Bad.
05as a collage it'd be more like 8000

Amras, do you have to antagonise, you're right you have a right to an opinion but you've voiced it now and continually rubbing it in people's faces is kinda rude. Why not just change the subject?
