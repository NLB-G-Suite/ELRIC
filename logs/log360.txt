minecrafting
'night
yes, because you haven't beat minecraft if you haven't made a 1:1 scale model of ponyville
and the moon
playing with my friends, do not care about the ending atm
microsoftemail.com << appears to be a scam domain, they just sent me two emails informing me of kinect for windows
...and you're telling us this why?
two of exactly the same email
warning?
can't find the websit4e
donou, its 00:27. stuff seems important for some reason
*website
it's 08:27 here
lucky
21:28
Phase4|NodeJS: I just realized when normal pony streams are up, it's 2:00am in your area
do you stay up or sleep?
stay up
its why i'm up now, adjusting a little for tomorow
today
tomorow
not a clue, to late for brain
early?
*derp*
surprised you didn't just get dari-trolled there
6 messeges in 10 seconds = kick
yes, but lag tends to make it where it's more like 6/20 or 6/30
Eeyup.
otakon seems really good at getting unneccessary dari-kicks
maby its a super lag and i will get kicked by this lin
line'
hyh
huh'
why will dari lag?
stream still paused?
just does
not sure, but the kick is based on the timestamps on dari's local machine
so if it lags and he gets a bunch of messages as a group
dari netsplits are allways fun
instakicks half the chat
then a set of messages that to us have a 20-second gap may have been held up and reach dari in a 5 second gap instead
yeah...
which is why i've been telling him his script needs more leeway
whats with the joins?
streams dead here
hai thar guys :3
the british are coming the british are coming!
wait... you guys are all going to sleep right now, aren't you?
lol
eeeenope
no... that's australia
Nope.
the British are coming?
It's 14:35 here.
Yes. Yes we are.
yeah, early afternoon
color/colour
Oh hi, ScootaChicken.
You're coming.
Now.
hi ScootaChicken
(giggity)
I'm coming.
all over the place.
lol ogawd
Get your minds out of the gutter.
in every city and every town
inb4 wrek comes back and wonders wat the eff we're doing
where else am I supposed to put my mind?
The Swedish are coming?
Brace yourself
oh HeavyMetalDash I added you on skype
HeavyMetalDash: In a fine suit and a top hat.
my mind is in both.
nice!!!
05...
my top hat is in fact, also a gutter.
"Hello my baby! Hello my darlin'! Hello my rag time gal~!"
|I want a top hat now though
dat Wrek
ohai wrek
hai ScootaChicken
suddenly Wrek
oh god
I wish I knew where to buy top hats.
me too...
i leave for a bit and the chat starts without me
a costume store at a minimum
failing that, ebay
but I want a nice one
what do you meen 'suddenly Wrek'?
I want a freindship top hat
Wrek showed up
yeah, wrek came back 2 minutes ago
and then went back to lurking
The Swedish -are- coming!
07[08:36:10] <Wrek> 05...01
suddenly i need to watch the new episode
errr...
did that post in color?
Resist that urge Mortyirc
yes.
Yes it did MirrorImage.
whoops
indeed
There's not long until satudray
didn't realize my clipboard pulled formatting
wait MirrorImage...
color?
i'm not using the BronyState client
how
?
and id on't know - i just copy/pasted a line
and evidently it preserved formatting, including color
but this was the second quality fic i posted to fimfiction and no feature and bs like sundude and moonbro and a fic about trixie and Twi as lobsters get featured
its very discouraging
Lobsters?
yes lobsters
lobsters.
05so bored...
dear god.
Sweetie Belle - I'm so bored
Wrek, you have an internet connection, and probably tissues.
you know what to do.
lol
wtf is happening here? every time i tab out a page of chat goes by while i'm not looking
im hoping it was just the awkawrd timeslot i got at 4 am eastern time, but i doubt it
must lose track of time when i'm tired
05nah... dont feel like cloppin' scoot
/me chooses to miss the point obviously
MicTheMicrophoneZero is going to do a dramatic reading of My Little Dashie
meh.
that would qualify ScootaChicken
Oh my
Oh, Goddesses.
i dislike the EqD people
3 screens, 1-Minecraft, 2-This & 3-TV
they are kind of jerks
I'm at school so I don't have the boredom relieving abilities some do.
watching TVB pearl now, the movie is weird atm
such as... nah, not going there
MictheMicrophone seems like a bit of a douche...
05probably gona catch up my missed zero punctuation vids
05then maybe play i dunno... wow or rift or any other mmo...
Scootachicken: he really is
Mortyirc: I don't know too much about him, I've only listened to a couple of his songs and heard the drama about the episode stream donations
Wrek: can I add you on steam as friend?
what other stuff has he done?
what drama would this be?
!cd
Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 1 days, 1 hours, 46 minutes, 21 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)
:3
dat Tom
05sure
Mortyirc: he said he has a copy of the new episode that was leaked and would livestream it if he got donations so he could fly to BronyCon
-_-
seems legit.
that sounds quite ilegal
apparently he raised over a thousand dollars
this stream you could fudge through cause of the ads, he's directly asking for money
although that's probably an exaggeration
ScootaChicken - $1700
That's... insanely stupid.
evidently there were a handful of $100+ donations
Humanity never fails to depress, doesn't it?
*does it
people evidently really like him...
hang on; he's posted videos about this
I honestly can't see why
05i'd hit im in the faic
inb4 the fbi raids his place
People like him, but he shouldn't abuse his position by asking for donations
I mean, he's an alright rapper but he's hardly the greatest brony musician
and whenever Mic livestreams he's such a dick
Nah, SOPA didn't get passed. :P
he doesn't even write his own instrumentals
alright, well evidently he's deleted the one video i was going to post
MirrorImage: I'm at school, can't access videos
like one time he was making fun of this kid who insisted that he be a rolemodel for the brony community
well, I can go onto youtube, but I can't listen to anything
Mortyirc - have you read the Fallout Equestria fics?
Mortyirc: if the kid was being all high and mighty and generally douchebaggery about it I don't see what the problem is
hello\
...
*sigh*
That... was kinda freaky.
daribot knows...
No Dashie_Dashie, nothing to do with you. :P
I just spent 8 hours of my sleep time repairing my xbox.
Ouch.
@_@
the questions stands though Mortyirc - have you read FoE?
oh dear...
Finally got my disc drive to work again.
Mirrorimage: Not yet
huzzah!
well, there's your opportunity right there
So much daribot
05seriously this community has way too many douchebags
meh
what Wrek?
looks like a fanfic day for eqd
Doesn't every community Wrek?
05"top famous" people that is
Oh, I see.
i agree
that's because we tend to cling on new material, and said 'douchebags' are the ones that pump out the most content
Eh, that'll always happen.
like "first" commentor?
I really need a gaming PC.. I don't want to spend another 8 hours fixing my xbox again -__-
"walks over to the walmart cashier and pulls out a gun, give me the ponies or somebody is gonna die"
lol
I need more ponies!
mind you, quite a few famous Brony musicians are pretty cool people
AcousticBrony and Mandopony to name a few
true ScootaChicken
indeed
although I don't really follow the drama about famous bronies that much
MrPoniator is best famous pony.
Ghehe.
I liek MrPoniator
I don't much like his vids, if I'm honest.
at least your honest lol
they're okay
I think he does a great job
Mrponiatoris sometimes good sometimes weird
school and whatnot
see ya
I don't really like sexjokes. And most of his vids are sexjokes. :P
I'm gonna go now guys
Have fun ScootaChicken
later Scoots
>Have fun
bye scootachicken
>at school
The only brony musician I've ever listened to is General Mumble.
give or take the animations he does with all the exams, classes, and homework is pretty damn good.
later ScootaChicken
what is this I don't even
just do eet
rofl ScootaChicken
Oh, he's GOOD Dashie_Dashie. I just don't find him funny. :P
find a way
He gets me to chuckle.
That's why I said 'find him funny' :P
It's not my style. No biggie.
I like the references he tends to make
omfg my inspiration came back!
thank lambofGOD
I gotta go
later HeavyMetalDash , be inspired
bai everypony <3
bye heavymetaldash
have fun HeavyMetalDash
I find it funny that my xbox works better now then before it went all poo on me last night.
I feel like such a nerd. :>
8 sleepless hours well spent if you ask me.
But of course.
I gave up on my XBox after my fifth RRoD.
I've never had RRoD's just disc drive problems
on both my xboxes
my xbox broke to :'(
05if syndicate ends up origin only, i will steamroll EA HQ with BFG in hand, shoot and bumtaze my way to the director and throw him into the broodmothers womb.
wat
Bumtaze is best strategy.
inb4 its origin only and Wrek does badass rage
05sure the game will probably suck
It's a shame Origin is so terribly.
Lol.
terrible*
05but atleast its syndicate "themed"
it is terribly
05and thats enough for a nostalgia trip
I'm waiting for RE6 :> and the RE for the 3DS
back to my normal nick, not doing alot of nodejs right now
05the 6 in the logo looks like a giraffe getting a blowjob
EA is greedy
^
plus the supports suck
Plus their online servers blow ass too.
BF3 anyone... owait.
always full?
05but yeah i have started boycotting games are arent on par.
and this is all ignoring ea sports
Their servers are down alot.
Hi Wrek.
05so far ME3 and perhaps syndicate.
oh haha, I just remembered that after I fixed my xbox, MLP was on the hub.
the topping on the cake.
05wow
05i sure are on the negative side today
Ponies
Wrek: I wish my grammar was as awesome as yours. :(
negativity brofhoof? /)
(\ brohoof stolen
well i guess thats negative too
:)
i mean
>: |
/( am i doin it rite?
nope
05and great now xcanox is mocking me again. time to suicide.
brb suicide.
Wrek: Are you gonna have yourself chopped up, put into a plastice bag, and thrown out of a car window? Cuz that's what I'm gonna do after I die! :D
/me stocks up on phoenix downs "oh boy"
/me hugs Wrek
oh I just remembered, I can't suicide..
hugs make all things better
<3
Dashie_Dashie: Would your daddy be disappoint in you if you suicided?
I'd just respawn.
Dashie_Dashie: y u suicide?
ragequit.avi
Would your daddy be pride in you if you did a Sonic Rainboom?
I drank 6 pints of milk today
my daddy would suicide if i mentioned a sonic rainboom
lol
The bones are strong in this one...
05did you OD on calcium dari?
XD
Milk is alright, I guess.
Think it's 510% of the daily calcium
heya all
Cold milk > all.
Milk is best used for tea.
ohai ekips
Heus, ekips.
Cold milk is delicious alone
05its ok dari, you'll jsut piss out the ammount the body doesnt absorb
Mortyirc: I can relate. I think it's a safe guess that unnatural items would come out of my parents' butts if they found out I'm a brony.
That's an interesting fact, Wrek.
Ohai
i allways find it strange when someone i was awake to see go to sleep wakes up befor i go to sleep
timezones r confuse
Phase4 what the fuck did u just say
He said this:
Phase4: That's because they realise that sleep is for the weak.
<Phase4> i allways find it strange when someone i was awake to see go to sleep wakes up befor i go to sleep
<Phase4> timezones r confuse
Phase4 timezone - 3 = Simon/Simon2 timezone
^ that
So they do it as little as possible.
I'm still dissapoint that I haven't had a dream about hugging fluttershy yet.
Y U NO WORK DREAMS?
^
me too Dashie_Dashie
I never want to dream about ponies ever.
You can't control dreams
Because waking up would be too depressing.
I^
same Dashie-Dashie
Accidental I is accidental.
i = sqrt(-1)
05lucid dreaming wants a word with you simon2
Simon2: That too.
05(yes its practicable)
dat imaginary ^
But I didn't actually meen the square root of 1.
No, 'i' is a letter.
DO HO HO
:P
mean*
O U
Simon2: e^i*Pi = -1 take that!
I do dream about ponies.
I've never had a lucid dream. I came close once but I accidentally woke myself up. :(
But I don't remember my dreams well enough.
I donno e & P ;A;
is it e^(i*Pi) or (e^i)*Pi
I usually wake up when i realize im dreaming
or go rape someone
05my dreams are funnily enough in high FX HD
in the dream of course
the second one
Mortyirc: wat
xD
Pahse4: e^(i*Pi) sry
Dreams are best when you're sick.
I ain't old enough to understand much D:
wait
05was protecting ponyville from giant wolves with samurai jacks sword. holy fuck the wolves were realistically bleeding and such
When I figured out I was dreaming, I jumped into the ocean and drowned in under five seconds. T_T
Wrek: wat
Secondary 4 here, anyone?
diddutz and Simon2 just gave me different answers
wtf
wow Wrek thats fucking awesome
Phase4: wha?
It's e^(i*pi) Phase4.
05they even had organs
omg!
I killed my first lucid dream by having the lung capacity of a lego.
xcanox: I actually had a dream a bit like that. I was in the cloud-canyons with cloud-statues. Suddenly, a wild flood appears! Then an alligator was about to bite my leg.
So I kicked it and woke up.
Legos never drown. Your statement is invalid.
ohai null
Phase4: Wimp.
Ohai
I challenge the banhammer!
Oh fluttershy.. you're such a troll <3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h2jbzoyNhk
I had a pony dream where i was a pony detective solving crimes in this big pony acaedemy posing as a student
rofl
05the best part of that dream is that once the final wolf jumped me, we all walked the dinosaur
I fought the law and the law won.
XD
My brother has apparently become a hardcore torrenter so I can't even load the stream right now... sigh
Wrek: O U
05there is no stream
Oh lol
lol null go into his room and sackpunch him until he stops downloading.
Wrek: Only then will you realsie the truth.
xcanox: lol
realise* goddammit
Dashie_Dashie: i love raritys face after fluttershy finishes
Dari, do u have the guts to try that again?
Still, it makes me have terribly slow internet.
05last zero punctuatiopn vid now
There is no dinosaur.
:3
05goan do some chores
05and if im bored
Try what Mortyirc?
05i'll stream whatever i will do
05because its better than no stream at all amirite?
Stream yourself doing chores
I really hate when my dreams JUST getting good I hear a "TIME TO GET UP Trollface.jpg"
Wrek: Stream the first episode of Pokemon!
Jim: That is a brilliant suggestion.
kicking xcanox. He says your a milk drinking swine!
inb4 im kicked xD
That's fantastic.
inb4 I go to bed.
owait.
NIGHT.
inb4 another inb4
It's weird when you wake up from a deram, and then fall asleep and resume the same dream.
Good night Dashie_Dashie
INB4 friday night.
dream*
Don't you hate when you're having a good dream, and then your mom wakes you up?
I should be on for BMN, not sure.
I wouldn't know, really. I don't do drugs.
05i do that all the time dari, though sometimes fails if i stayed awake for too long in between
in the dream, you don't think it's weird, but when you wake up, you do
xcanox: Absolutely.
The monster is like: Ohai Morty, remember me!? Kills
I don't remember the last time I had a nightmare.
Not even when I had the flu.
05best part is when you are lyign there think ing a scenario, and as you drift asleep you dream what you were thinkign about
Did anyone had this experience where you continue your dream in real life for a short period?
Simon2: no
I'm ready for the stream!
I hadonce
Simon2: I think I know what you mean, ad yes.
When you resume a dream after waking up, I still didn't remember that the dream was a dream though.
and yes*
I wasn't speaking Latin there. I just had a typo.
Even though I knew it was a dream just a few minutes ago.
It's weird.
that is weird
i can top that though
I have never had a lucid dream.
feelsbatman.png
I don't remember any of my dreams any more Kammerjunk.
:P
Hey, have any of you, after watching a scary movie or something, felt like your dream was dark and heavy?
It's not a nightmare, but just feels off?
I remember mine very faintly for like, 10 minutes.
I'm not sure that I've even had a dream, because I can only remember going to bed and then waking up
The best dreams are the ones where it's something so mundane that when you wake up you genuinely think you've done what was in the dream
one time the last thing i saw in a dream was my babysitter, and when I woke up she was still in my vision. I could see my room, but she was floating there too. Then she faded away in blocks.
>dream about brushing teeth
>wake up
>think already brushed teeth
I like those dreams that don't make any sense after you wake up.
Mortyirc: Ghosts!
Epona: They're fun.
Why is there no stream yet?!
05worst dream this yeas so far: Im standing there at a sink, and im as thirsty as i have ever been, it was horrid. and i took out a glass and filled it. the water was perfect and ice cold. i drank adn drank and drank but the thrist never went away.
it was wicked weird. full on dream hallucination
05so i keep drinking for a while
05onyl to wake up and rushign to the ktichen for a glass of water
/me has never had a dream that made sense
05cause i was still thristy when i woke up
I've done that in real life, just drinking water, but still being thirsty, dunno why
Wrek I had that same dream, but always still needing to pee
honestly would not be able to explain my dreams, there conceptual things that dont fit in rational space
no it did not end with bed wetting
Do you have any memories that don't make any sense, and you have no idea whether it was a dream or real life?
you c- >'night
05imagine someone crying in sinus curves.
god
dammit.
Most likely, the memory is from your childhood.
Sine curves are sad
my brain tends to dump stuff like that, if i had any i wouldnt remember now
Has anyone this weird one-second-Dreams where you dream you walk then trip and then wake up?
diddutz: yes i got hit with a snowball
i hate those diddutz
I don't get why dreams have to be such trolls though.
and they allways happen in the middle of the night
ALWAYS when something good is about to happen
Wake up.
true
that has happened to me more than once
at least in the ones i can remember that had a rational end
Well since there's no stream I'm going back to xcanox. D:
Pinged mahself. :3
lol i found that cute
i'ma go bet time now. gnight

derp

And that sexy nurse.

what's streaming?
Dark_Horst: Rift
no
oh alright
rift
is it rift
?
when my roomate was playing this it didn't look this good, @Wrek must have a good pc
I think it is, he said he would be streaming it
Finish your drink whenever Princess Celestia speaks: A Bird in the Hoof or The Best Night Ever would kill someone
he said either rift or skyrim
and this is not skyrim
@Wrek... "EAT MAH BOOK!!!"
I don't like the camera angle, but that I suppose is because we can't see the entire screen
"read a motherfukcing book, scum"
i got to go be back in about an hour
have fun bear2229
you misspelled fucking Dark_Horst.
whats on stream atm? skyrim?
something?
dont recognize this game
i'm sorry
This is rift Ingwaz
it's rift
ahh, i see
Gonna play some Ace Combat
Mumorpugger
so, what is it that makes rift good?
Anyone in here play Ace combat?
is ther a pc version for ace combat?
all mumorpuggers - Right click, start kicking the enemy's shins, then they start kicking your shins, you keep kicking shins till one of you falls over
/me has never played anything besides a super mario game
never liked Mario
no, horst, there isnt
how dare you.
see, this is everything what's wrong with the gaming industry. console-exlusives
sorry, always been a Sega fan, always will be... since they don't make consoles anymore I buy nintendo, but on principle I don't buy Mario stuff
"by the power of my math book !"
Ace Combat 6 was 360- exclusive, but the new Ace Combat Assault Horizon is for PS3 & 360
Super Mario World was the theme of my childhood
Anyway, anyone play ace combat?
i really liked super mario bros 3. that game ruled!
The_4th_Wall there's several games that didn't get ported to the ps3, that's the major in joke about ps3 not having any games
Super Mario Bros. 3 was satanic.
AVGN told me so.
And then he fought his console with Nintendo accesories.
accessories*
never really got into Ace Combat, to me a flight sim is best played on the pc
suddenly, pixles
A flight sim is best played with a joystick.
^
/me started playing Borderlands instead
I also play racing games with joysticks, but that's because I'm too lazy to go out and buy a wheel.
I like borderlands
I liked the game similar to borderlands better... Dead Island
yeah i saw that too Kammerjunk
Saw what? That I'm a lazy git?
Xbox 360, my gt is MetaMiek
well i have to leve no bye everypony!
See you.
Bai
Kammerjunk ya from Brittan?
Not quite.
Denmark.
ah, Kinda figured somewhere in europe
Just making runs on Crawmerax, if anyone wants to join me
I like using those. I just do it on a whim, mostly.
send me a friend request, i'll add
Do you have it on pc?
We need more cross-platform games.
VALVe did a good job with Portal 2.
360
awww
I have borderlands both on pc and ps3
Hello
but not 360
Hi Sammy
What game is that?
On the stream? Rift
So I'm watching the first X-Men because I'm bored and the first 3 films are great.
I know, they are, arent they :)
And suddenly, I notice that Rogue's boyfriend looks scarily a lot like Robert Pattinson.
my 360 gamer tag is WoefulRequiem, though I don't have Gold so I wont be able to join most games :(
The reason why I don't have the 360 is because of I don't use my consoles enough for the reoccuring costs for internet to be worth it
*ahem*
Gentlemen.
ohai PinkiePie101
Hello everypony
hello pinkie
I got that, woeful
Hi
I got a 360 spacifically for Warhammer 40k: Space Marine, and Silent Hill Downpour

"The 4th Wall"
/me is broken
PINKIE PIE WILL BREAK YOU
I still wish there was a mutant version of Martin Luther King, Jr.
What game is this?
That's rather spesific Kammerjunk, why?
Rift PinkiePie101
Oh
Holy shit a bear
Jim: Because I'm watching X-Men.

Pinkie Pie is a maniac!
/me waves at everypony

Hello Rainbowjack
It is the opinion of the entire staff that Pinkie Pie is criminally insane-sane-sane-sane.
ohai Rainbowjack
Everypony...

Hey Pegashy
Hi :3
Just saw the new episode :D

Same.
You watched it.. BEFORE Saturday? D:
Eyup :3
05so yeah
It came out early.
We're aware.
Couldn't resist
A wild Wrek appears!
05it may be borign to watch, but its better than no stream at all...
I dunno why but I'm glad :D
Please don't spoil.
I wont :3
Pegashy: I pity you.
?
Also someone made a youtube poop of it the day it came out :D
dat shockwave crash
I pity the fool who pre-watches episodes.
for those who don't know, iTunes messed up the date it was supposed to come out, so people downloaded them and pu them up on youtube
srry couldnt resist it :'(
oh
but yea, I will be waiting like the good foal I am
ah it's the valentines episode this saturday... should be a good one
I cant wait to see it streaming this saturday :3
I am excited for valentine's day dunno why xD

I had no idea.
05seems like no one midns the stream, yay! normally there would be hate
eeyup
We don't celebrate Valentine's day in Denmark.
Daaww
It's friday for me
Or, rather, not in my family.
We do, however, celebrate birthdays tomorrow.
I only got one card in my whole life :(
/me gives Pegashy a valentines card
nope.avi
I've gotten none.
^
Well one is more than none
We don't celebrate Valentine's day in general, asides from a few coupl.es
Flower stores love it, though.
I'm 22, and I've never kissed a girl
I know this year I won't get one too :'(
I actually don't care.
who is playing RIFT?
The_4th_Wall: Same, but I'm 18 ._.
But yeah I'm 11, but maybe cause I'm on high school I will get one xD
Rainbowjack: Wrek is
You're still young Pegashy, just wait.
I'm 15, and I've kissed a person or two, but it's not something I care about greatly.
^
WATCH, AS THE GREAT AND POWERFUL PINKIE CHANGES HIS NAME!
TADA!
wat
I kissed an ROTC girl once, but she asked me to, does that count?
Every time valentines is mentioned, I get the urge to post this picture http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qaf9v649wtQ/TVNBbEieXtI/AAAAAAAAAo8/jCuTncPoMPU/s640/valentineschocolates.png ^^
Dken2021: What's ROTC?
I WANT!!! RD HEART
.___.

Awww. That would be the best possible gift.
Jim: That is the only kind of Valentines gift I'd want to give.

Hey TOY_PON3
Wait

TOY_PON3
Nope

RainbowcrashNBurn: This is RIFT , and hey
RIFT.
	Quid novī?
Tee hee
O U
lol...I have my youtube in spanish so I can "me gusta" videos, and a mlp video that was taken down had this message "Disculpa las molestias"
Spy!
I'm the real jim!
Bene, gratia. Et tu?
what does that look like to you?
Are you a spyyy?
never seen rift before...is this one where you have to pay extra for decent equipment?
Yes, of course.
/me spy checks.
Valeo.
HEY HEY HEY
apparently molestias is a word in spanish
Holy fuck it is?
And what does it mean?
idk
imma look it up
Discomfort.
To google translate!
copy and paste latin
Molestias means discomfort.
aha
LMFAO
it means problem
molestia = problem
so true
would explain the root word
He is Mi!
so it also means opportunity ^^
That suits it more.
And I am Yu!
Yes, I am you
Ohai DainbowRash
Molestias, parasprites?
derpy_pony: I don't copy-paste, so I can't do them fancy accents.
Molestia = problem? Problem? = Troll, therefore Molestia=Trollestia
well, I do
Ohai.
I am you
and you are me
Jim that was best logic
I can do the accents on my iPhone, but not on my computer.
Spy around here!
WHERE?
Ok.
lots of running around in this game
Well I gtg to school now so bye everypony
Mhm.
where is the coke and the hookers?
or dragons and stuff
right here
have fun TOY_PON3
oh...hai
okay guys I'm done being a spy
wait
have fun, TOY_PON3 :)
I CAN'T CHANGE MY NAME BACK
FFFFFFUUUUCCCCKKK
Will do
f5 time
once a hooker, always a hooker
Indeed
Nope.avi
I was the spy all along.
I knew that.
the mutated fox looked at you funny
so how come nothing is streaming in here right now. Just that videogame paused
I thought it was a pony/fox
he did?
O U
fjaæ
why is it so blocky sometimes?
Whoops. Sorry.
lol.
Too much data for the stream to handle
I accidentally my keyboard.
therefore it goes blocky
tentacle spider
in fight - proceed to mine
does it cost money to stream?
No, it's streamed from their own computers.
Not sure, the adds should fix the cost
mips.tv is financed by ads
^
Via sites like livesteam or mips.
03a
so feel guilty for having adblock installed
derpy_pony: We all do it
It's unusuable with ads
A dragon?
eeyup
magic eruption
magic *snort snort*
kill the dragon, save the world!
NO
SPIKE DO NOT WANT
That book beam so reminds me of Twilight.
"Twilight"
RIFT needs a pony mod, NOW!
Sparkle.
c:
I can't see the word Twilight without thinking of Twilight Sparkle anymore.
Obviously Sparkle.
sparkly vampires
Kammerjunk: Same here.
To hay with the vampires, I have PONIES.
I don't think about the vampires when I hear that word yet
anymore*
Be back shortly
k, bai jim :3

Yup

And then....
Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?
the silence stopped :o
JUMP!
*was thinking it kills you*
FFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
/me jumps

Laser shark? Not epic enough.
YEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHH
can someone please help me
I forgot my password
a native tribal village
Your password to?
It should be a guitarist on a dinosaur riding a shark with rockets and lasers.
kill them and steal all their gold
Laser shark? *thinks of Austin Powers movie*
for my bnc
i feel like i am watching a ripoff from WOW
Try #znc
When I hear Laser Shark, I think of Epicus Maximus.
yes, looks like just another clone
how do i join via mirc?
Ask there, someone's gonna look into it
....
/join #znc
When I hear Lazer Shark, I think of Lazer Shark.
or can I join from here too?
Yes, you can join from here.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pozlp_wnkRk
derpy_pony: Thanks :)
lol.
Also, Epicus Maximus had a nice callout to Tobuscus with the EPICOSITY title.
I love it when I kill the chat.
Chat is dead, long live the chat!
XD
brb*
and I'm back
Lol.
there are just not enough people to comment everything
Do it anyway!
I might not be here for the first movie during BMN
it'S 10am or so on the east coast...and most of them went to bed only a few hours ago
it's almost 5pm here
I might not be here for the second film.
back
Because I really don't feel like being up all night.
But, staying up all night is awesome
I'll probably get home from a friend to 1 am, then I will be able to see both movies
what game is this? It looks cool
this is RIFT pony_4032
oh my tab fail
Yeah, but I have a party to ignore, a pony episode to watch, and a virtual wedding to attend.
XD
I mean Ponygirl82 of course
lol
LOl
on equestria radia is a show with live phone calls between 4am and 6am cet on sunday...the moderator is angry and slightly insane most of the time...and a fanatic rd fan...and people try to troll him...it's fun to listen to that
radio
What's it called?
celestia radio...that was the nam,e of the station
SAY WHA-
No no no man, you're making me fall asleep
The line is Say whaaaa
Say what
makes me wanna go play an mmorpg now
me too...but then I remember the mindless grind
I hate that I get addicted to MMORPGs too quickly
and that I don't know anything about modern bots
I don't have that problem anymore, because now I have a stronger drug: Ponies
That
00,10lets see, early am, game I dont resonise, this must be Wrek.
Oh hi Sumica
eh I'm a very antisocial rper I just head off on my own and hack everything that moves to bits for XP and points, and ignore most requests to team up XD so really no point in playing those sort of games, might as well just play an FPS
My ass has finally decided to eat my hand! IT HUNGERS FOR MORE!
hey Sumica ^.^
kill it!
I absolutely love RPing.
it looks evil
coward coward coward
lol
I spend hours on end to create a character.
now you will die
00,10A wild mod has appeared *cue battle music*
lI
:O
derpy you are very violent. I like it XD
oh, wheres that from Kammerjunk, I know I have heard it before
And that's not counting the backstory.
Everypony
Jim: Dr. Weird from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
PO IS A BRONY! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fj4vDzgRLg
:3
But you might have seen the TF2 videos.
everything is better with lava
Who's Po?
Isn't that a Teletubbie?
Kung-fu panda.
oh well duh, Jack Black would be a brony, he has it written all over him
I am a pacifist, Ponygirl82
Oh. Never watched it.
He's like "I HAVE A POISON STRONGER THAN YOURS, AND THAT POISON IS CALLED FRIENDSHIP!"
sure you are derpy ;)
inb4 brony
mmorpg murder doesn't count
lol ok
Gentlemen... Behold!
Corn!
:O
Also
seriously...on of the guys who bring a spider out into the garden carefully

the "friendship" part sounds like friendshit.
XD
Ohai everypony :3
Hai Starflash
hi Starflash
00,10Behold the Thermo......Stat!
ohai Starflash
Thermonuclear missile?
Soo how are you guys doin
Tired.
So tired.
Gonna sleep before BMN, Kammer?
wasting time in a pony chatroom
Starflash: Heck no.
Sleep is for the weak.
sounds like a good idea
Time you enjoy wasting is not time wasted
I'm bored. wat do
Sleep is for the weak, or the smart XD
enjoyment doesn't pay the bills
derpy_pony one does not just simply get a job
sleep is for the sleepy
awake is for the awakey...?
having a job means humans around me all day long
naaaah
because awakey sounds stupid
'cause I'm pretty sure half of my co-workers are apes
you need a job in the zoo then :P
:P
maybe the butchery would take me
I'm wrong chatting like there's no tomorrow here.
my skills are useless in a zoo
I love the new EQD banner :3
btws wuts this <_<
RIFT.
rift
it's about clicking monsters to death
^
oh sure.
:')
stream failed
DAT BUFFER
well, he's killing crates now, not monsters
Hmm, dat buffer
it's dead jim
*2 hours later*
/me pokes the livestream
still bufferin'.
ah
nvm
now
Right when jim poked it, it went back to normal o_O
I iz wizard
magic
JIM, YOU ARE AMAZING
jim shall be the new queen of bronystate
or, the new princess >:3
Fabulous darling
Wait
if his name is jim, why do you think he's a girl... o-e
'tis a joke PinkiePie101 ^^
pony society doesn't allow males in administrative positions
Boys can't be princesses and queens too?
oh ._.
so jim is princess now
just a formality
Princess Jim is now canon
no, he's a servant now >:3
Equestria is so sexist against stallions.
thats kinda sexist now I think of it.
exactly Kammerjunk
Meanwhile, in equestria...
it's like Dark Elf society
hmm....... Ponydrow
WE'RE SEXIST AND WE KNOW IT
I wouldn't know, I don't play the Elder Scrolls.
*music*
haha
mining love and happyness with their stallion slaves
PinkiePie101: I see what you did there.
:3
You know what, I bet stallions don't have equal rights.
but wait
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTZE2M0XzU8
down with celestia!
flaw in the whole Boys can't be royalty........
What about Prince Blueblood?
he is a pawn
stupid like a brick
He can't rule.
he is a prawn
prince blueblood is a Duke not a prince
I saw a picture of a male baby Alicorn in some kind of magazine
Lauren said so herself
then shouldn't he be called 'Duke Blueblood'
Or duke GREENblood >:3
Rain: And Luna knows we'll take Faust's headcanon for fact.
Like AJ's parents-
He is called Prince Blueblood because hasbro likes money and Duke wouldnt sell aswell
OR RED BLOOD, OR BLUE BLOOD, OR YELLOW BLOOD
OR-
he behaves like a turnip farmer, not like nobility
/me explodes
According to Faust's headcanon, AJ's parents are dead, Dave.
if he is the best male pony nobility has to offer...welll
Aren't most RL royalty inbred anyway? Seems to me he portrays that perfect
ly
Well then, they are dead to me
Alicorn prince: http://dash.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132872498044.jpg
Rain: Exactly.
Think it's from a french magazine
Oh wow
It is, Jim.
and there was this rumor...
Surely, you can see the French.
but...no spoilers allowed here
Blueblood is also not Celestia's brother. He is her cousin, 57 times removed
Prince Blueblood is very much like a French person
Quite.
ima go to make videos and stuff.
bai everypony
bye PinkiePie101
bye
Ayup everypony! It's half-term now!
hey
I remember you!
ok then Globetrotter?
hi Globetrotter
Half-term what?
Is it the Superbowl?
Are you pregnant?
Oh.
after half of a term of sixth form
I call it school, though.
of course you will use the time wisely for your studies
like we all do
Yes
of course
Twilight would be upset if I didn't do my homework.
¬_¬
I talk to her. She is the voice in my head.
I totally don't have like 5 skyrimnexus tabs open
Well, one of them.
finding any cool mods?
Dear Princess Celestia, we totally dont use our time wisely.
I heard the creation kit has been published...anything cool already?
PS: I didnt learn shit!
Globetrotter: And I totally don't have 23 EQD tabs open.
I think I must have derpy in my head then XD
Luna darned fanfics taking all my time.
yes steam, I am totally 67 years old
4 Hours untill the stream?!?!?!?
hey don't you be damning Luna!
7 by the clock at the top
In my head I have modelling clay in all colors of the rainbow
I better go get some snacks soon.
almost 8
Ponygirl82: I would never. I meant Luna darn it.
lol it's going to be too late for me I think
And thus, Luna darned.
Lol
depends, though. Is it ponies in 7h 45m ?
it is airplane
it's the movie
!cd
Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 0 days, 23 hours, 14 minutes, 56 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)
under 24 hours until ponies :D
Thank you kindly Tom
ponies tomorrow...or...well...
tomorrow
Very well then, continue with your darning. And be sure to darn ALL the socks, those ponies need them in this snow!
still another 48 hours til we can talk about the new ep though.
Tempus imperfectum, you know.
It's magic.
Download ALL the mods!
Dont do that Kammerjunk
I'm sorry.
Wait, do what?
What game is that I see on the stream?
its hard enough already to keep myself from watching it
darning
please dont tempt me
I lost the fight, rain
What did I do?
darn = to mend holes in garments
in...like 0.7 seconds
:P
I just said "Tempus imperfectum" ._.
I watched it because I'll probably get lag spikes when 700 people get here.
may have been unrelated to the 48 hours thing but
[10:15] <Kammerjunk> It's magic.
I am waiting until tomorrow before watching it
Oh, no. Past tenses are magic.
then I appologize ^_^
My Latin Pony: Conjugations are Magic
>_>?
Yes.
anyone going to the bronycon?
Oh, I wish.
Wait game is that]
I wish I could
I've said it before, and I'll say it again.
That is RIFT Globetrotter
oooh.
Anypony going to the BroNYCon in June, give Faust a BIG hug, will ya?
Is it a memorpugger?
for me 2
hello everyone
Globetrotter: Eeyup
Salvê, bear2229.
hello bear
hi bear2229
Or should I say... HARRY?
and anypony that is going to Bronycon I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO JELLLY
bronycons is in NY right?
Oh, what I wouldn't give to actually meet Faust in person.
I give up with this stream, I've refreshed who knows how many times and its still loading endlessly
yes
Globetrotter: Hence the pun, BroNYCon.
yes
I wish I lived in NY.
I don't
you can fly to ny
It seems like a way too huge city for my taste
Globetrotter: I don't plan crossing the Atlantic either.
cen you take me there derpy
*can
Fellow Brit! *Broohoofs Globetrotter* /)(\
probably not
sry
lol
/me brohoofs Ponygirl82
Flying across the Atlantic is so bothersome, anyway. Almost as bad as jet-skiing or swimming across the Pacific Ocean.
Where you at Ponygirl82?
Seriously, how did that end up on Google Maps?
anypony here from Holland?
Staffordshire ^.^
thesse people in the game must know alot about friendship
Do ho ho, because friendship is magic
That's not that far from me Ponygirl82 . I'm in nottingham! Just a pop east of you.
Fighting is magic is a cool game
I wish friendship = magic^2.
this might work
can't wait for fighting is magic
Jim me 2
I've never been a big fan of fighting games.
Depends on the game for me Kammerjunk
I've never met any other British ponies where I live derpy, they are all a dour bunch who would rather dress like chavs and act like they are cool than love and tolerate because that is 'Gay' and thus intolerable ¬_¬
I just end up mashing all the buttons, anyway.
did anyone try the mmorpg they presented at the last bronycon? I never hear anyone talking about it
Will you make an exception with added ponies?
No whats it called?
same over here Ponygirl82 But I managed to convert 3 of my friends!
I've managed to accidentally convert some Russian guy I know over the Internet.
I didn't even mean to.
How did you manage that?
hm...join the chess club or anime club or something in the library...you will find them, Ponygirl82....in the places a chav never enters
Yeh bloody British people need to get their tea thermos out of their bums and cheer up
Quite.
Well its snowing up here Globetrotter
/me loves the rain
cold enough to freeze your arse off
Somehow it's raining here today, and I live in northern norway o_O
It's stopped snowing up here Ponygirl82
its perfectly sunny for me
Got a load of snow last weekend though
hm must just be local then
the roads are wicked slippery
it's getting dark here...sunset...the horizon is turning red
my luck
where it shines through the clouds
lol snow is only good when you get proper snow
the sun set aproxemately at 4 pm here
...WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW? http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz4qld9BEP1qezg8qo1_500.jpg

Those...whales?

can you imagine if you had to play a game with totally no visuals just black screen, how hard would that be. It would be like being blind, could only rely on sounds
WRITEity: Oh, wow.
I did NOT notice hat.

hnnnggg... Right in the childhood!
I've only seen the disney cartoon version

everyone dead in here?
i am ded
big surprise not
I'm a zombie
Yeah, me too
What's up
well I'm alright then, I have no brains for you guys to eat
You cannot brain today?
You have the dumbs.
I cannot brain anyday
i r baboon
I'm a vegetarian zombie.
but plants don't have brains
oh look, someone remembers a show I used to watcch
I remember a lot of shows people used to watch
I don't.
If it's nostalgic to most people, chances are I didn't see it.
bah young people
They were on TV.
I just didn't see them.
The only thing I've had to do with Pokémon was Pokémon: The First Movie back on VHS.
bleh pokemon I never liked it much
I've never played Mario or Sonic.
me neither
wut
I have, does that make me a minority?
Not even teeny-tiny bit?
nope
never played mario?
DainbowRash: Not in the slightest.
i thought everyone's played that, but eh
oh wait
I've played a little bit of Sonic and Knuckles which was okay but I always sucked at mario
i did play it one
once
The only thing I know about Zelda is what I saw in YouTube Poops.
everyone's bound to have played mario in their time
but whatevs
oh ditto I've never played Zelda. I've played a ton of old games but none of the really well known ones
Dken2021: Not in any way, shape or form.
I have never held a Gameboy.
you're like the AntiNostalgia Kammerjunk it's scary
well at least you probably had a better childhood then others I suppose
I played 2 Zelda games. IMO better than Mario or Sonic
When I was a young boy, I read.
I read a lot.
reading? whats that
I read a lot too
I own a little over 700 books.
Somewhere in the attic.
i jk i did read too, but probably not as much as others
I use to have read books when I was little, then I had a gameboy
When it comes to reading, I'm pretty much like RD.
but I still like to read from time to time
most of childhood was spent playing original Doom though, like I said I like violent fps (well at the time it was violent. Nowadays your grandma could play it)
But if one story gets my attention, I can read it for hours.
DainbowRash: You like doing it, but you don't want anypony to know?
Kammerjunk|Who: Well, maybe except that part :D
Aw I guess Rainbowjack left. Too bad
I like Rainbowjack. It's a good ship.
It's even second best ship to me.
it is but I prefer PinkieDash
Im not too early am i?
Twixie takes first place to me.
too early for what?
Golakka: Just 4½ hours.
for the stream yes Golakka
would borat be conserded an a or ab movie
it says 6 hours and 36 minutes at the top
Oh, right.
Personally i think the Titanic is the best ship
I'm an idiot, sorry.
I'm not too fond of shipping.
The day doesn't end at 20:00.
it's alright you can join me in my brainlessness
Silly me.
no brain = safe from zombies
Golakka: I'm watching the Doctor on the Titanic now.
oh that one, that was fun
Yup.
Really good episode if im honest
David Tennant is my favourite doctor
^
Tennant is sexiest Doctor.
I don't think much of the new one at all
Im Scottish, so i have to agree, by law.
lol
I'm with Dari on Matt Smith.
Someday we could watch Titanic II on movie night, if we add a C-Movie Section
I'm 1/8th scottish does that count?
nah, Raise the titanic
I'm all Viking.
diddutz what movie would borat be
im 1/8th french :P
Vikings are cool ^.^ I love their culture and mythology
alexxm: Out of any scale you throw at it.
idk never watched borat
Sascha Baren Cochen is banned from kazakstan "Upon pain of death"

Why is battle pirates soo bloody addictive

hi
hi 8980
good morrow
my damn server has gone belly-up
dehehe
and for once it wasn't something i did!
i think there's a network failure in the datacentre
apparently, staff are working to fix the problem
Is there a stream going on?
meanwhile, this means i don't have access to any of my coursework i'm working on
time for the pub, methinks
I'll take that as a "gtfo"
/me GTFOs
time for pub indeed
I'm hungry.
But I'm too lazy to go all the way downstairs and get some food.
xcanox: there is, but i think it's gamestreaming
Kammerjunk|Who: COME TO SCOTLAND AND EAT HAGGIS!
you know it is the only way your heart will be free
You know, I've never had Haggis.
and your hunger can be quenched
it's actually damn tasty
I think I prefer some bread and a cup of Earl Gray.
earl grey + scones + jam
+ clotted cream
My mouth waters.
what game is this?
WoW?
<.<
>.>
HELLO... hello ... hello

She said "Come down, boy, sit beside me on the floor.

emangamer: Son, it's not boring, it's just reality. Take a deep breath and appreciate life.
emangamer: saying 'trollish Brit' is redundant
Quite.
She's a fragile child.
Gumri, except that u broke my leg
You Brits are trolls at heart.
Better leave her alone.
am I on mute or something?
/me will bring ScootaChicken a disney hat
/me goes to check if her chat derped
Rain: Can't hear ya. Ah'm asleep.

Kammerjunk: Orlly? Cuz I have you on record admitting that you don't know how to tie shoes.
N- No you don't.
00,10Which one?

RAAAGE
sumica world
Oh, gee. Thanks.
/me continues walking and trips again.
00,10oh fun. Only been to CA
I regret nothing.
I still have a house in orlando
but its being rented out
00,10but then again I had friens that worked there so we went like every other day
I am trying to work out what we are talking about but it is proving hard
Gumri: I'm not sure whether Wrek will consider that a compliment...
sumica, i know. i had a season pass so i went like twice a month
Not really a compliment or an insult, an ovservation.
is Wrek using LS to stream or mips?
Kammerjunk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC7g3DawSgs
mips
00,10wrek uses mips
but i must leave
HUGS ALL AROUND
00,10have fun emangamer
Oh, hey. Spongebob. Another show I never watched.
^
hugs emangamer
mips is a pain because when you click it it sends you into the void of internet.
so the stream is on black out atm right?
no there is a stream but not much on it.
/me is not sure if her school likes mips
damn I wish he was using ls
the campus likes LS
You know I couldn't believe my eyes, it felt so good inside, you said that you love me, oh yes you did, yes you did, yes you did.
I am just about to be brilliant!
I am going to ponify all of the holy grail!
hai gaiz

00,10well some parts are already done, like the french taunter
that is epic
lol
well... this is a slow day...
and the bridge of death went up yesterday i believe
Gee, I wonder if I will get anything to eat tonight, or if I'll just stay up here because I'm a lazy git.
Kammerjunk: You gotta take a lace in each hand, you go over and under again. Make a loop-dee-loop and pull, and your shoes are lookin' cool.
this campus hates mips so much that clicking on it doesnt even send me to another site
...Twelve. Twelve. Twelve. Twelve. Twelve.

HD gifs
05i return with garlic bread
Gumri: You should have checked the "Show hidden files and folders" feature.
General fact: Adolf Hitler's mother seriously considered having an abortion but was talked out of it by her doctor.
and that is true ^
also
how many pictures was it Gumri
Wrek!!!!!!!!
i wonder how the doctor felt in the war
how have you been Wrek? ^_^
Quite a few but no where near enough for 3gb
hey wrek
00,10ohhi wrek
Remember: Without Hitler, the world would be completely different.
ohai Wrek
We would probably not have this fandom.
lolwut
why
no doubt about that, kammerjunk
Without Hitler there would still be poverty in England.

inb4someone says Molestia
Wrek: Thanks :)
...Sorry.
Radu, did you know molestias means problem in spanish?
...really?
Me Gusta
yes really
'Molestias' translates to "discomfort".
i knew that earlier today
So did I.
But nopony will listen to me.
you know how when a pony video is taken down theres the red sad face that says "weve encountered a problem?"
when you switch to spanish it says hwjq kdk skq Molestias
With dat :/ face
mortyweb : yes
well the first part is wrong
but it does say molestias
Coincidentally, 'molestias' is also used by the "Lorem ipsum" thing.
someone please take a screne cap of what Wrek is doing and link me so I can pretend that I am watching him draw
:D
Have you ever dropped your cellphone into water?
Actually, 'molestias' is in Spanish the plural of 'molestia', which means anything from problem to bother to annoyance to discomfort.
mfw I dropped my phone into soup 2 months ago
coincidence i think not
It derives from the Latin word of the same name.
I think the name of this particular song is Shine On You Crazy Diamond.
Id est, also molestia.
hiya guys, what's up?
Wrek drawing I see
I think mIRC is using an English keyboard layout on me again.
Ohai otakon
£
I'm just going to restart mIRC.
Again.
well... im gonna go, have some lunch... get some excercise and play some STO... laterz!
and I'm back ^.^

10,02Welcome back Ponygirl82!

DAT SB
Hi SuperBrony64
So yeah.
10,02DAT RADU
10,02hai :3
05hmm
10,02Hai Wrek :>
'Molestia' has it's origins in the Latin word of the same name, meaning anything from trouble or annoyance to molestation or dislike.
Hello everypony
Hi Altair c:
I cant see what you are drawing Wrek, but I am sure that it is Twi and I am sure that it is awesome
Hi Radu
NO THE EVIL NAVIS
Are you gonna finish the battle scene aswell, Wrek?
So yes. Molestia actually means molestation. In Latin, the word for it is the same.
05i have a shitload of work to finish
Work is for the Wrek.
so, how right was I when I said that guys?
Radu: It's odd, really. In Latin, the word for molestation is the same as for annoyance and dislike.
Rain:*
Goddammittabkey
Perhaps in the dictionary, molest has a reference to the Spanish word
Which derives from the Latin word of the same name.
...I saw Altair.
Hi ScootaChicken
/me glomps Altair
/me hugs ScootaChicken
ok then Kammerjunk...? random much?
05atleast pony isaac is turnign out alright
hai Altair :3
wait
Rain: Weren't you the one talking about it?
Isaac, inb4 his twin brother Newton
Wrek: this is a dead space crossover?
I had to restart mIRC, so I can't see.
05yes otty
and hi Rain
ok now nthis picture is badass
Wrek: it's coming along nicely, your pony Isaac has improved greatly since last time
whats that arrow right next to issacs hoove
Wait, look at the hooves.
What's it saying there?
05its a personal note
Oh
05says "fix it"
Kammerjunk: I was the one talking about Wrek, drawing Twi and it being awesome. I cant see the stream but I am sure that is what he was doing
Rain: Aha.
It's all because of my silly tab key and my tendency to use it even for 4-letter names.
Hay, I use the tab key when talking to Jim.
05hmm
Like mine C:
05no one feels liek buying me heroes 6 on steam >.>
05?
05xD
Don't have the cash, myself.
We got to have MONEEEEH.

Wrek: I totally would.

i want friken zoids
bear2229: To quote the Medic, "Later."
bear if u watch now pm me the link
i cant find it
:(
but i will wait
Isn't that considered as a spoiler?
no bear please DON'T share that
bear should have pmd...
people want to watch it on SATURDAY
when it streams
ponygirl82 : they made comics about the episode XD
I didn't read them
05so is stream working?
and I don't want to
Yup, nice concert right there
why do people always forget the "no spoilers" rule
Say, Wrek, does this crazy piece of moon technology you call IRC have a system of limited banishment?
unfoundbug: They don't read the rules.
they wilfully forget it bug
/me comes back to bronystate in tears TT__TT
05cause people are ALWAYS complete idiots untill proven otehrwise
or trolls
but not much difference between an idiot and a troll really
What happened Midnight_Tempest?
What's wrong, Midnight_Tempest?
05trolls are idiots on purpose
true
but still idiots
05but yeah
Not literally, but yeah.
05make sure to watch the stream if oyu arent
05you're missing something epic
Is that Wembley?
What's on then?
T_T nothings wrong... i just got a letter from a friend and her mom... it's the most wonderful thing i've ever recieved...
Watching the stream? But I still have 39 chapters left!
oh happy crying XD
05kammer
66 chapters doesn't seem that long, really.
05if you arent watching
05you are missing out on epic PF
ohokay
what is this?
hey what concert is this?
See, this is why I fail.
Is that Wembley Stadium?
not my kinda music
Pink Flyod, Pulse
really?
Roger Walters did a The Wall concert here in Denmark not long ago.
05Pink floyd, PULSE at earls court 1994. the whole 3 hours of it
Didn't go.
mfw it looked like a stadium
Damn nothing like their earlier stuff
eh, not a fan of pink floyd
How is that even possible?
Next I know, you'll be telling me you like Rebecca Black.
damn... i cant stop crying... T_T
I like Pink Floyd but eh, this song right now not my cup of tea
*shrug* not my cup o' tea
Mmm... Tea...
/me drools.
Lol?! Same expression in 5 seconds
No! I can't have tea now!
I'm too lazy to go downstairs and make myself some food, so I ordered a pizza.
Tea time passed, silly
05isnt earls cournt a stadium radu?
thanks Ponygirl82 :)
05court*
And pizza is not right without cola.
Radu: It's always tea time.
pizza and tea go together awesomely Kammerjunk
Every wake moment is teatime.
and no way, I DO NOT like Rebecca Black, I forever curse the name of my friend that made me listen to that infernal song to ingratiate my brain cells to the knowledge of her existance... those are moments of time and cells I will NEVER get back
It is? Well, if it's a stadium, I suppose it isn't a football stadium.
05hey Kammerjunk, you live near helsingör?
Inquisitor: So you forgot to get down on Friday?
grrrrr
Wrek: I have no idea. I live a little west of Copenhagen, around mid-east Sjælland.
Town called Taastrup.
05ah
mfw I thought Kammerjunk was from Spain
05perhaps a bit too far away to come visit me this sumemr then xD
QUE
ohai SaxyPretender
Kammer is now otakon for some reason~
Probably. My geography skills are horrendous.
um no
0,14oh hai Altair and everyone!
Que should que que.

well, you're the dude from spain.
Oh hi, SaxyPretender.

/me hugs everyone in the chat
suddenly SaxyPretender

05also dem lasers
I don't even know what QUE means, but I feel like I have to type it that word in caps and then say it out loud in a thick Spanish accent.
Dat X
que means what Kammerjunk
Oh.
Dat ad. >_>
Well, what should what what.
10,02löddeköpinge, is that what they call a Hilton in Switzerland?

You know, I've never heard Pulse.

05good opportunity then Kammerjunk
05i own the DVD's
Goodnap, SuperBrony64
I'm not sure, but I think my father has The Wall album and film on CD and DVD respectively.
But that's all.
3 hours of amazing PF music... this is making me cry more... damnit...
10,02Soothing music? If I turn it on will it be heavy metal? O___O
He's a Floyd fan as long as it's The Wall.
05but i can never bother watchign them

It's Pink Floyd.
From 1994, apparently.
0,14It's Pink Floyd aka AWESOME
10,02Alright, I'll check it out
So I suppose the singer is Roger Waters?
ah, so I was right to mute the stream :P
when will the concert end?
Never.
Pink Floyd is sexy.
Pink Floyd is sappin' mah nap time, right SB?
05amaras lost 1000 respect

Except for Shine on You Crazy Diamond.
xD
oh David Gilmour, you and your five fret bends
you make me so jelly of your immense guitar skills
I thought the singer was Roger Waters.
05holy shit i know this concert better than i though I did
05t'
lol
Kammerjunk: Wish You Were Here is probably my second favourite album by them, I'd defnitely recommend it
my stream is derping 6_9
It just doesn't know what went wrong^
I've mostly listened to The Wall and DSotM.
10,02Wrek, turn off mIRC sounds ;A;

Sumzuka.
Ponygirl82: Eeyup.

Ponygirl82: on this channel, only the mods are allowed to use colored text
Ponygirl82: I could tell you how to get coloured text, but don't use it here or the mods will hambanner you
^
#colouredtextisforcool

00,10Kammerjunk it's easy Shizuka is the female
I only go to this theatre anyway
fair enough
Sumica: I'll never remember that! I can't remember basic facts!
10,02This song
although I don't think I've really seen you around before Ponygirl82, do you only come here on Friday?
Shizumica?
SuperBrony64|NAP: ...is awesome.
13radu...
/me is happily listening to Schubert
13vizuka ist only true pairing
David Gilmour is such a boss
I only come here on Saturdays usually until I found out the theatre was open other days
I wasn't pairing yooou, I was just mixing names
I'm partial to prince-tennant.
Shizumica!?!?
So sir
lol Ponygirl82, that was the same for me until about mid-November
10,02:3
05out of all PF songs, crazy diamond, high hopes, and sorrow... are my top 3. with all the other song a fraction of a nano millimeter behind
holy shit brb cat about to drink from saucepan with chemicals in it!!!
Dat SuperBrony KICK
/me hugs Radu
prince-Smith
Raimica
inb4 dari comes and kicks me to the moooonaaaahhh

0,14so quick show of hands, how many people's dads got them into Pink Floyd?
/me raises his hand.
T_T i dont have a dad...
10,02Who's Pink Floyd?
/me raises his hoof.
my dad got me into Classical music
05my dad raised me with queen, PF, etc
he knows nothing of rock
fuck me that was close, now its out of reach and the door to kitchen LOCKED
05he's awesome
05and DIre straits ofc
My dad basically rai-
Yeah.
/me knows nothing of popular music in general
What Wrek said.
Ponygirl82 : save the cat !
yfw I have no mouse plugged in, and I'm trying to live without the mouse
I did now Yellowquiet
and mfw I can't close the kick note from SB
0,14I love Money for Nothing
a friend of mine introduced me to Iron Maiden three years ago and I've been into old school rock/metal ever since
0,14the guitar riff is so godly
10,02You all can beat me with a hammer now for thinking Pink Floyd was the same as that girl singer named Pink
Sultans Of Swing
beastly song.
nosey little wench likes sticking her face where it doesn't belong
My dad couldn't accept that I did not like Pink Floyd or Queen or Ozzy Osbourne.
Money for Nothing is great as well
0,14Another great song
lol SB
So I liked them.
05my fav dire straits song ought to be telegraph road extended end solo version
/me dislikes the video here.
well... im gonna go get some excercise now... probably gonna listen to Pink Floyd while I do it too
/me throws a hammer at SuperBrony64|NAP.
/me does not hear the audio
ooh Dire Straits
my favourite band is probably The Who mind you
cya Midnight_Tempest
Feel the Hammer of Justice!
00,10good pick wrek
0,14later Midnight_Tempest
although that opinion tends to change every other day
05yfw the lasers displllay the image of a moving cloud in them
saxy, you are so blinking today
aww bye Midnight_Tempest ^_^
/me is amused with the lights
Ha I like you guys you all have awesome taste in music
05then try to focus on the lyrics SB
this song is making me feel sleepy
This song is making me hungry.
I dunno why, but when I hear Kammerjunk's nick I think of hammers
Or maybe that's the lack of food.
10,02Suddenly, buffer
Yup.
ill be back *you just read that as Arnold*
/me turns up volume
Radu: I can't imagine why.
:O
so sick of being the only rock fan in a town where everyone likes the crap masquerading as music that the wannabes on tv shows produce
/me regrets turning off the mute
Midnight_Tempest: I did, and I even read the last piece of text first.
05Amras0000 is best troll
how anyone can like that cacophony is beyond me
I'm not trolling
I hate this music
quite literally
Then don't complain, really.
05which is why I will never respect you as a human being.
Then mute and begone with you.
:)
stop complaining or leave
xD
fine
We don't need to know you completely HATE this music, perhaps HATE is a strong word.
I see
You just really really really really really dislike it.
I dislike the instrumentalisation
Dose lights :3
I dislike the light effects
05love and tolerate the guitarrs
0,14^
David Gilmour <33333333
I have it on mute I'm ashamed to say but in my defense I have a headache. I love Floyd and will listen to it later, but not in the mood right now. I am enjoying the pretty flashy visuals though XD
let's not make a discussion of it. Not even a round of banter. let's keep it at a remark, and just move on with our lives, better people...
I dislike the costumes
Love the music. Be the music.
For instance, I dislike Eminem.
im weak...i watched it
we also dont need to know everything you dislike Amras0000
Radu: Meh. His older works are alright at best. His newer, not so much.
I'm a musician. I'm a percussionist. I really hate the percussion part in this piece
c'mon
just mute it if you don't like it
I guess you have a point
>_< ok... im out... love and tolerance levels reaching dangerous lows...
Imma do this now.
Yeah, and what's your favourite genre? Rap? Hip Hop?
Amras0000 you dislike it
bye Midnight_Tempest see you later
so yeah, what's this about the leak? What happened there?
05you should have seen my dads face when I got him an 20GB SD card filled with PF, dire straits, queen and so on
aw bye MT
bye Midnight_Tempest...
Radu: mine?
Yes
05for the new car he bought
20th century art muic
Amras0000: This is like that guy who kept telling me exactly how much he wanted to kill Trixie. I got the point at first, but dearly, my Frank, I don't damn a give.
aka, classical
05ever since then he's been cranking those speakers
Amras0000: we get it, you don't like Pink Floyd
Quill: new ep was put on itunes early, Mic streamed it on his Livestream and it's up on YT now
:)
if you dislike it, don't listen to it
00,10did you bro hug wrek?
it's very simple
^^
/me hopes she isn't in the doghouse for also having it muted because of having a headache
0,14nah, it's cool
I really should agree
nope Ponygirl82
It's just
otakon: Well that was silly of him.
that when I had PF muted
I really do love Floyd <3
ding
I was accused of sinning
05also *cough* Amras0000 is totally the 1%
hence the discussion
.1% *
Amras0000: people probably weren't being serious when you said that
here's a refreshing change, I said I didn't like it, I have it on mute, and I'm not discussing it...
Quill: no it wasn't, he bought it fair and square and then streamed it. He got 2000 dollars in donations that night though to go to Bronycon
I'm not quite sure you get the concept of a 'joke'.
05Ponygirl82 its cool
So hold on, I'll get it for you.
okay, brb need to make my PIZZA
I just like to take jokes literally, for fun
yikes
i love old music *.*
otakon, if we're suddenly talking about the micthemic drama, you and me are going to have a very long conversation...
darn I want pizza T^T stupid paycheck not coming for another week. Stupid cupboard full of tinned crap :C
So you're a troll
does anyone here like The Who?
Who?
I do!
I do
10,02So yeah, this song needs to be one of my background themes everywhere I go.
joke (noun): something not to be taken seriously : a trifling matter
Im not a rabid fan
inb4 people who only know stuff of Who's Next
but they are good
ohai SB64
would anypone here be so kind as to PM me when the concert ends? Please?
Sure.
10,02Ohai Mortyweb :3
sure Amras0000
thanks
If I remember it, that is.
See you in 3 hours.
05dis song<3
I tend to forget stuff in 10 seconds flat.
I never really listened that much to PF. It sounds really good.
10,02I'm off to take my nap now after having this sound therapy O__O
don't you dare SuperBrony64|NAP
:C a fans a fan ScootaGilmour shouldn't scorn people just because they didn't have a proper rock upbringing and only just got to know most of the greats
0,14later SB
bye SB
Goodnap, SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64|NAP: This sound therapy takes a while.
sweet dreams
dream of ponies
10,02Pausing the stream right now should be considered a sin, but I need sleep before my class ;A;
Ponygirl82: I'm not scorning anyone, I'm just saying that a lot of the people I know who like the Who only know stuff on Who's Next
mfw ponified version of Pink Floyd
can't you mute it and leave it running whilst you sleep?
I don't really think its that much of a problem, just something I've noticed
05posted that earlier radu
10,02The point is, pausing it in the middle of this song.
Oh, really?
05yeah
I said ScootaGilmour not you ScootaChicken
what are we watching there?
05if i werent streaming id relink
Ponygirl82: I changed my nick to ScootaGilmour for a couple minutes
oh ok
Don't worry, Wrek
Dark_Horst Pink Floyd
okay
yeah, don't take it as though I was criticizing anyone for only knowing that album
05oh and Ponygirl82, sorry if im givign you a headache :C
The chorus. The chorus!
well it felt a bit "If you only know this one really famous album then you are not cool enough like the rest of us"
Congratulations, you have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to "Old Pink", care of the funny farm, Chalfont.
0,14I once considered buying my dad The Wall CD for his birthday, but it was too much money ;n;
nono its cool Wrek I had it from way earlier
sorry if it came across like that Ponygirl82

Ponygirl82: That's because we're hipsters.
/me puts on his hipster shades.
xD
i'm not a hipster
/me smacks Kammerjunk across the head
brb, putting on my hipster glasses, skinny jeans and tennis shoes
I deserve that.
I was a hipster before it was cool.
forgotten ScootaChicken, I'm cool, you're cool, we're all cool. Love and Tolerance for all! /)(\
but then again I dont' really feel that strong about music
Radu: That does not compute.
Why not
Lol what is he doing?
Pinkie Pie solves it
otakon: I absolutely LOVE music.
Ponygirl82: /)(\
aha
lol
I listen to it as often and as much as I can.
sounds like his guitar would speak XD
good evening fellows of bronystate.
Guitars can speak notes
Hi Shivtsku
okay I'll unmute and put it on quiet
Dat Wah-wah. :3
Yellowquiet: he's using a talk box, so it kind of is XD
or at least I think he is
053 major thigns here in life that keep me going are Music, Classic FPS games, and my closest and dearest friends and family.
ooh fps games <3
I'm not watching the stream atm, I'm only listening to it
ScootaChicken : ;D
3 major things keeping me going is music, ponies, and ponies.
yep, he's using a talk box
i thought his guitar would this noises XD
Wrek: AND PIRACY!
dohohoh
05nope
I needs my weekly fix of Ponies too Kammerjunk
Oh hi, [wub]ehren.
yes Wrek
PIRACY
Ponygirl82: SOON
05no allcaps
i want a sound box
Yellowquiet: a talkbox basically makes your guitar make noises that you create via your voice
SOOOOOOOOON?
but you love my allcaps really
Meh. I need to get some sleep, then maybe I'll be alive enough for BMN~
inb4 kick
05dont force me to make an example out of you.
aw :C
Wrek beat me to the punch
Oh, btw I watched a movie 2 days ago on TV, with a kidnapper that was playing DOOM on PC while the police was tracking him xD
so you change notes so they go woahaojofjowjojoijahfoao
its fine because I can't stay connected for more than 20 seconds Wrek
im not sure why I even tuned it
Ponygirl82: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/673/soon%20%281%29.jpg

How long left of this concert, anyway?
Shadowmere: Pulse
05total 3 hours
Wrek's Doom streams are brilliant

I'm uber sad I lost my cd of it :C I had Ultimate Doom which had the first and 2nd, Evolution and TNT

Mic was totally in that crowd
He is. He's lurking.
Kammerjunk - i haven't seen her in a while, or Fluttershy' for that matter
*dari
why did I just write Mic...
Kammerjunk: I don't know, haven't seen her in awhile
that was weird...
So I'm not just logging in at the absolute worst times.
MirrorImage: Fluttershy no longer mods, but she pops in time to time
all the lights and everything remind me when I went to Mayhem festival

Au contraire, mon capitan! Heeee's back!
lol idk
Mortyweb> And I'm not drunk enough.

05wait what? what does DR WHO have anytihn to do with this?

if he is, then Pink Floyd just transcended levels of awesome that I didn't know even they could accomplish
Doctor Hooves
on the show background pony
00,10it sounds like it a bit there
Wrek, it sounded vaguely like the Doctor Who theme at one point
Seriously, how the hay do you ponies deal with your english layouts_
it sort of sounds like the theme music
They#re confusing!
See!
hahhaahah
Dr. Who->Dari->Pink Floyd

^
0522 minutes
Wrek is getting drunk again? Party at his place!
guys, I think the new episode contains ponies

In his bed
Or 9000 hours, depends how many times you rewatch episodes
05yay this song xD
scootachicken, no spoilers
with the lights off, so I can show him...
my awesome glow-in-the-dark watch! :D
every episode of mlp fim contains ponies
it might be a discord, tom, littlestrongheart gilda episode
oh and zecora and spike
You spelled Trixie wrong
Oh yes, this song.
Money.
oh yes.
and the sea serpent
*cough* even joke spoilers are a no no *cough*
you know i heard tom was going to wrestle john cena this year
trixie derpy dj-pon3 and mickey rooney
05gilda falls in love with littlestrongheart which secretly is in love with tom, who is alreayd married to discord but is looking for a mistress.
How can you mention the sea serpent and not mention Trixie?!
xD
>.>
Rain, but Wrek just did it...
Wrek please write that fanfiction
05i already am
0,14all right, I gotta head to class, see all you for BMN
suddenly Breathe
humphery bogart
Wrek: that was epic
that wasnt a spoiler silly
huh, thought it was Money...
see you later SaxyPretender
aww bye SaxyPretender ;___;
/me hugs SaxyPretender
ScootaChicken: Silly filly.
hi all
that was a summary of his fic
<3
all fanfictions I saw on the internet are of 2 ponys kissing eachother e.e
bye saxy
Imma silly filly...
lol wth :/
lol Wrek don't play with my heart, if you don't write that I will
that Tom, he sure does get around. A real highroller that one.
or the plot of his fic if you will
Then you haven't read MLD yet, George.
I wrote a fanfiction of two ponies kissing each other
05you are looking on the wrong places Georgelopez
This sounds like Speak To Me.
why can't a fanfic be like a regular episode but better?
Also, mfw my second name is also George
05its breathe
those two ponies were Gilda and Diamond Tiara
Oh, yeah.
yep.
I just have Speak To Me/Breathe on my playlist
Gilda is best pony.
Rain: you here too love =O
Gilda isn't a pony
those two ponies were mickey rooney and judy garland
So I wouldn't know.
right...XD
Tom is best pony
internet full of pony-fappers
rarity is best pony
Young Tom is best pony
...Blueblood is best pony.
I was here before I was there Baka-Neku
mick foley is best pony
wth did you drink last night?
I wonder, are they going to be epic and play all of DSOTM now?
x D
05as i said george, stay with us, forget the cloppers
http://poni.0au.de/story/9834/To-Catch-a-Predator%3A-Filly-Edition%21 Georgelopez
Dem lights <3
thats not about ponies kissing
Mortyweb: I read that one, it was fun.
Everyone of you desservers a kiss D :
Georgelopez: the internet is full of everything-fapper
/me gives mateo a kiss
I'm Twilight Sparkle according to that test XD
lol thnx kammerjunk
Hello.
kiss from a boy? lol no thanks
you mean flapper like the flapper women from the roaring 20s?
Ponygirl82: Yeah, me too.
oh you homophobic e.e
Which makes sense, she's my favourite pony.
hahaha dx
honestly, i wrote it to prove people like crap more than atcual good stories, but ive grown to love it too
05Georgelopez, IM perfectly fine with homophobes, as logn as they are homophobes behind closed doors.
DING
Followed by Trixie, but that's besides the point.
zuul
00,10Reminds me of a bit from Cowboybebop now
Wait, what's homophobia again?
im not homophobic, im just straight lol :/
the fear of gay people
extreme closeupXD
O
dahah
ooh this is a bit psychadelic
then kiss me : /
love this one
Heavy: KISS ME
Radu: homophobia (noun): An extreme and irrational aversion to homosexuality and homosexual ponies.
am i high
weird, but it is artistic
straight = not gay = boy+girl
normally it is a fear held by people that are uncomfortable with their sexuality
Cheers Kammerjunk :D
its when you are like "hey fag! You like ponies? must be fag. pink shirt? must be fag. not a fag? must be fag. fag"
and they may fear that a gay person can turn them gay
Not a fag? Must be fag
Mortyweb: You remind me of 4chan.
homophobic people annoy me.
or they are hardcore religious
Seems legit
yea i know what straight means : /
mostly because I have to deal with homophobes on a regular basis.
Mortyweb: Were they have straightfags.
the hell am I watching?
or they are already gay and they hate that they are gay so they hate on anything not masculine
pf.. whatever.. *kiss mateo^* e.e
dat bed
Sundaysmile: Pink Floyd.
Pulse.
1994.
oooo
did the streamer get us high
um what just happened
puaj, get off u gay >: /
Wait a second, is this a concert also streaming the music video?
How badass!
05you are watchign Pink floyd, PULSE: live at earls court 1994
hahaha x D
LOVE this video
I admit with shame I have a bad habit of using the word 'gay' to mean 'lame' I really need to stop it. I am not homophobic and have many many gay and lesbian friends I view as equals but its a bad vocabulary thing
yea.....
Tbh, I never swore IRL
Wrek, are they going to play all of DSOTM?
ponygirl82: i hear ya. Its cultural brainwashing at its finest
well, i usually don't get offended if you use gay as lame
05its all right Ponygirl82, no one here will take offence
05Im sure
hm, actually, the word gay is better for insult than saying... idk "oh you straight dumbass" :/
lol
LOL
epic explotion!
Because insulting the majority is like throwing yourself in a hellpit
Ponygirl82: I do the same thing, and I'm bisexual so...
Mateo: Which reminds me that people call me racist if I say "black man", but not if I say "white man".
aww yeah, Time.
05how to properly insult someone: insult their intelect in a way they themselves do not understand.
time
xD
use sarcasm
ftw
Use Latin.
mateo the problem is that gay is sometimes used to mean straight dumbass.
or use insults from the 50's
hm yea right, todos ustedes son una manga de no saber español
hm must turn sound on this UP it is pissing off my neighbour :D
my dad has the regaee version of this
jaj, yo te entiendo tontito
goddamn chowderhead
lol
Reggae version of Time
I must have this.
damn, forgot you speak spanish e.e
now.
Insult someone's intelligence in Latin. Because you know what they say. Quidquid latine dictum sit, altum viditur.
that dickhead knocks on the wall if I play any music at any volume at any time of the day
I really wonder what's on the stream right now... so what is it?
even if its like midday and really quiet
i have the dubpolka version of this in G major
he's a total tool
Oh yes, this song too.
yes it does actully exsit scootachicken
05you are watchign Pink floyd, PULSE: live at earls court 1994
05derp
yet he blasts his Bob Marley at floor shaking volume
i am the only one who speaks spanish here :/? besides mateo
ding
13Kammerjunk: that which is said in latin appears profound
Dat CTRL+V
to be honest, I actually like 90s CG better than some current cg because it wasn't trying to be all realistic
yeah....
Shizuka: Exactly!
alexxm: I need that in my life, right now.
omg listen to him, throwing a tantrum now, screaming and hammering on things. Get a grip douchebag
George Lopez: Molestias
in fact my dad has the regaee version of the brick in the wall album i think
that is all
Did Pixar animate this?
If a ponny kisses an animal? is that zoofilic?
I have to listen to ponystream with headphones because he throws a tantrum about that too
05the lyrics are epic on this one
for 1994 this looks amazing
techically it was trying to be realistic, it's just that people had lower standards back then
why the hell are you asking that?
For example, if they call you something, tell them that "ne supra crepidam sutor iudicarat."
if a pony kisses a non pony its zoophilic
the alblum;
05told a douchebag at school he has an oedipus complex.
so are humans
the album's called dub side of the moon scootachicken
05he replied with "thank you!"
maybe it will be furry
Wrek: Lol.
oh lawl Wrek
Wrek, kick otakon please
a human isnt an animal :/
I got dc'd
Hmm, Pity. can't sleep like this
its a human
nvm
I'm back
whats a human?
Wrek: It's his own fault for responding like that, really.
05there
and dont say a human -_-
hm actually, a human is a class of animal...
He could've just studies more.
05oops
Lol, Wrek.
I said mvm!
nvm
no its not :/ !!!
scootachicken here's the link for it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HK3oE6fRD0

Wrek: will the Mare-a-thon be streamed?
yes amras
so.. we are gonna watch the newest episode of mlp or a repeated one ?
the solo in this song is actually pretty easy...
in 3 hours Amras
still awesome though
When I hear a country, I always try to think about football players from that country.

what time does the mare-a-thon start in GMT time?
05the newest epsiode of MLP will be streamed when it is aired
hm, i think a new one
^

Hi kirzstryfe
afteroon kirzstryfe
hiya kirzstryfe
hi
afternoon/evening kirzstryfe
hey krizdtyrfe
hi kirzstryfe
<--
05as far as I know the mareathon was goign to be streamed. but I wouldnt take my answer as final, bestw ould be to ask SUmica
what does the @ at the start of you nick means :/?
means operator
basically moderator
^
00,10It's in the newsletter wrek =p
/me noms kirzstryfe
Amras, stop telling us you hate Pink Floyd, we got it, but stop bragging about it. I hate show off's.
no trolling, got it :|
05w/e Sumica
I can't wait for Us and Them
shit's gonna be epic
Wait, is this a YouTube video?!
05if i remember shien on and us and them are soon
Sumica, so the pony ep is 30 minutes late?
oh damn the oven I forgot about my chicken O_O
run!
xd
stop the fire
don't burn the house down!
xD
00,10yeah it will be at the end of the marathon
save your food!
Icy.
/me reads the newsletter. Again.
doughnuts and candy floss at the ready
Wrek, it sounds like they're performing Dark Side of the Moon in it's entirety atm
where is this newsletter?
so if I'm right it'll be Money and the Us and Them after this?
www.bronystate.net
05maybe
05im going of my memory rigth now
05too lazy to look it up
*sniff* maybe
oh its fine, I forgot I put it on a timer so it turned off ages ago. Its just not cooked properly XD. Take 2 at making dinner
Is this a Youtube video?
05and tbo, its more exciting if its a suprise :D
05i have the DVDs radu, do the math
Hmm.
Dat circle <3
05MONEY
CURRENCY
This is my FAVOURITE song <3<3<3
05as performed by Pink FLoyd-
This should be Rarity's themetune XD j/k
or Mayor Mare
lol yeh
Rarity isn't rich.
she likes money though
I remember I heard that tune somewhere.
Yes, but it's not canon
...yet
technically Applejack likes it more
1,3haven't listened to this song in such a long time
^
^@Sundaysmile
05rarity is a custom dressmaker, she makes more than any other of them
Applejack likes work whether or not it involves money
05guaranteed
I'd love Rarity's job
Only AJ and Rarity make money, and perhaps Pinkie from babysitting, but the other 3 don't.
05also: epic sax guy
When I was a kid I used to watch this concert at least one time per week
I think Pinkie did it for free
and then I become a lighting guy
1,3Pinkie works at sugar cube corner
Who knows, perhaps she gets paid a few cents per week
can you imagine if Derpy babysat the twins?
would rather become a lightning guy
derpy +10
Rainbow works on the weather team, doesn't she?
05fluttershy may earn a buck from tendign peoples pets, probably vet student. twi is already a student. RBD works for the weather control
1,3Rainbow Dash is the weather pony for the town
Money <3
dis solo...
Twilight probably gets an allowance from Celestia
David Gilmour is such a god
actually, derpy would be good at babysitting twins, she could keep her eyes on both of them at once :P
she buys enough writing supplies to suggest she has money to spare
So yeah, Twilight is the only pony not making money at all.
Rainbow dash?
Or, perhaps Celestia pays her for her friendship letters
1,3Twilight only gets her stipend if she covers all the plot points in her weekly letter
well nevermind
05she may also earn a buck from tending the city library
Twilight has been mooching off welfare ever since she thought she contracted horn rot
Twilight = Student loan :P
Twilight = moocher
lol even more fitting I got Twilight then :P
05Sundaysmile you dont insult twilight with me around >:C
Twi even loses money, as she has to take care of Spike too
Wrek Twilight is my favourite pony
1,3baby dragon, tax credit
Pretty sure shell get loads off celestia
Twi loses money because she checks out books to people without ever recording it.
oh yeh she probably makes Spike work to earn money for her
and I'd find it funny of a alt arc where she's just a typical student
05your faces when the goverment pays me to go to school
Really.
05true story
same, Wrek ^^
How much?
Go UK education system while its still running
051050 a month in high school
1050 dollars?!
05no, SEK
Jesus, thats a LOT
Which means about...
You know, once Twi gets her degree, she's gonna learn real fast that a liberal arts degree in Friendship means slim pickings when it comes to job prospects.
300 dollars?
eh I'm past school age or I'd get that too
indeed
05more or less yes
Wow. 300 dollars per month. 10 dollars per day
Not Bad.
05as a collage it'd be more like 8000
currently on disability because I have severe depression and tried to kill myself so they said I'm not fit for work
:O
WRITEity, very few degrees will mean anything in the current market
depends on the degree.
work related degrees do weigh more than a liberal arts degree though
05PonyGirl_82 all i can say is hope life is treating you well atleast.
Masters in computer science, and still struggling finding even an interview
Math Time! I'm so going to calculate the money you get during High School in Sweden
I'm getting better slowly Wrek. I haven't tried again in a while. Sometimes I still get real low but I'm managing

Nope
05live to you now
then how is Wrek talking?
it's not bad, a LOT like TF2 actually
my Doom fics were about the multiplayer personas of this game as a team of space marines, but I admit as a girl I kinda wrote some girly shit about relationships, you know what young girls fanfics are like. It was like a Doom sitcom with monsters XD
the stream is a bit behind
05ots caööed tab and windowed mode

I know what you're trying to do. It's not funny.
oh, right, pausing

LunarKing: well welcome, look at the rules and know that even though it's not in the official rules page, spoilers of any kind are a instaban
Si

i wouldn't dare tell anyone that i'm a brony
/me calls a hitman for moop
how racist
That's why Scots aren't brits :)
I'm aware you just learned how to spell "to". It appears you need to learn the concept of using the space bar.
Turtolian: me, PonyGirl_82, Arentius, dari, Sundaysmile, Dumori, Globetrotter and StickySyrup are all British, to name just a few
and Gumri
amen to that maximus

bf3 maps are SHITE
its not so bad
otakon: Bleep bloop skype~
god, sometimes i forget how tough can old games be
hai dar Dashiee
Is Wrek the most popular streamer? It's usually him whenever I'm here but I rarely come...
No lead up, just God deleting System 32
diddutz: i wouldn't say dieing was much of a win
diddutz: if you use mm/dd/yyyy you look silly to me, very strange date encoding
I'd actaully love to watch half life 2 :P
I hate Revenants
its because people have to use glitches like the highway on that game
That is his boom stick.
the way they scream when they see you always makes me jump
especially if its from behind
I still play Bf2 with my old clan sometimes :p
then you turn around and bam bony fist in the face
Boom Stick! What's that movie called....Army of Darkness?
Yes <3
Hmmmm.

Nope
/me hides behind shield

Cypresswolf: eeyup

it's not bad enough to be good
MahBoi777: ikr
soooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and it's not good enough to be good
Turtolian: no prob, enjoy. I like BF: BC2 more myself though
I just had a look at a thing to see if heven would be like Equestria. Too bad i can't get there, you can't be a sorcerer.
and so may new names
I have a book of Hitchhikers signed by Douglas Adams
zealot so silly
Fist of fury.

StinkomanFan: no, BFG is best gun
Gumri'll shoot it down though
you're introduced in chapter 60
I'd love to see a Doom 2 movie, if hollywood had done the 1st one right. Personally, I prefer video game walkthroughs to VG films
as of 85 you're still not dead
*changing name* back to moop
Dang ad came up
BFG9000 kills too easily
GOOD WORK
oh Airplane, it's gonna be GREAT!
I like the chainsaw *sadistic grin*
Cause Gumri HATES fun
RYNO is the best gun ^^
11,01BFG 9001 is better.
PonyGirl_82: no kill like overkill
Why would i shoot it down :D
Stay out of my shed!
Airplane was funny but i think Naked Gun has to take the cake

YES!
StinkomanFan: PERFECT!

Blazing Saddles <3
Oh come on blazing saddles just aint my kind of comedy, i love airplane
This music is actually making me sad now, for never playing DOOM in my childhood

VOLUME!
so Courage The Cowardly dog new seasson, are you excited ? because i'm excited:O
oxygen.exe has stoped working
6 elements in frame
2 weeks ago
sugust
WHAT>>>
Early November.
I've been a brony since june
they find 5
Yeah, RainbowcrashNBurn, but it's funnier that way
2 weeks ago
august
7 years ago
It's only a rumor
Near the start of season 2
Livestreams, alrighty then.
lol
lmao
mid april
OhioBronyShow: my friend told me about it
june
I was unsure until about August
lol
OhioBronyShow: about 6 weeks ago
actully, technically it was nightmare moon who was bannished
lol
best rumor so far
lawl
From what i could tell there is no mane chat during poni
August 21st 2011, for me.
Shhh StinkomanFan let me dream
trixie is french
that yell
Luna had become nightmare moon before the bannishment
THAT BITCH
TheGreatAndPowerfulT are you serious omgomgomgomgomgomg
A week before read it and weap

Should I pull an al nighter for the marathon or try and 5 or so hours of sleep?
Monty Ponython for the win

lol Trixie is so bawss.
I think it was around when Applebuck Season was the latest episode, though I don't know exactly
ive been a brony for 7 years
Yes?
That makes more sense.
A new season of Courage, an nobody but that one guy knows about it?
The moment I truly became a brony was during the Lesson Zero stream
Also a good idea.
05,15as in correct
lol
I knew trixey was french
monty python <3
You were a brony before it was cool.
lol
ha
such a win
WAHA XD

0,14Indeed.
00,03TGIF!

:('
Pony time!
During episode streams mane chat goes down and the pony rooms come out.
and +m
05,15Airplane is best random movie
11,01It's the last friday EVER!

0,14If it's for ponies, I'm okay with that.

It's not like mane chat is worth being in during episodes anyway
why though?
00,03Its never too early for ponies!
So Big Macintosh walks into a bar
ah, so #bronystate will be mods only
too much I guess
05,15In case you don't know it starts at 6 AM EST
I assume to prevent overflow issues
07,01Also tonight during the intermission we will run the lottery.. if you have not returned your ticket yet, please do so now. We will lock the survey after the A movie
It's a flash flood
Why bother trying to police that?

we WILL have to meet here to chat
O_O
