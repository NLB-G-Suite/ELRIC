1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Natalie Portman's parents were extremely worried about the smoking scenes in the film, and before they allowed Natalie agree to appear, they worked out a contract with Luc Besson which had strict mandates as regards the depiction of smoking; there could only be five smoking scenes in the film, Portman would never be seen to inhale or exhale smoke, and [SPOILER]
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: THE FEQU?
Because bronies are weird
she must have been 13 at the time of filming
wait......i remember this movie DAYUM so long ago i have seen this it was awesome
Why do they ask in manechat instead of in private

Screwed indeed
Shamroc, I've had an old as fuck RP room from the early days of Bronystate. It's been used a few times recently mostly by Gildash and his friends.
13You know I just look up the wiki to help describe them to you, right? xD
oops
reminds me of my old neightbourhood
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the scene when Stansfield (Gary Oldman) 'interrogates' Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco), Oldman smells the father, and gets extremely physically close to him. According to Badalucco, he had no idea that Oldman was going to smell him, nor that he was going to get as close as he did. Badalucco says that in the film, his look of discomfort during the scene
hits little girls and tells them not to smoke
1,11is completely genuine, as he felt decidedly intimidated by Oldman, and the physical proximity between the two made him very nervous.
Peace Lilly.
nou
04"Stop smoking cigarettes!" I get the feeling that her parents demanded that line be in there
00,10lock is secretly a peep hole
Okay, ill smoke weasels instead
I blame is all on SB for this silliness Meanwhile.:D

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to Jean Reno, he decided to play Léon as if he were a little mentally slow and emotionally repressed. He felt that this would make audiences relax and realize that he wasn't someone who would take advantage of a vulnerable young girl. Reno claims that for Léon, the possibility of a physical relationship with Mathilda is not even conceivable, and as
1,11such, during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Mathilda to be emotionally in control of the scenes.

In some scenes, he affixes them with sound suppressor, with threads that extend past the compensator cuts to cancel out the escaping gases that could potentially escape and produce a loud gunshot.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to Patrice Ledoux, Luc Besson planned Léon as filler. At the time, he had already started working on The Fifth Element, but production was delayed due to Bruce Willis's schedule. Rather than dismiss the production team and lose his creative momentum, Besson wrote Léon. It took him only 30 days to write the script, and the shoot lasted only 90 days.
1,11Ironically, Léon is now generally considered to be a far superior film to The Fifth Element.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When the film was first tested in LA, the version that was screened incuded a short scene where Mathilda asks Léon to be her lover. However, the audience became extremely uncomfortable and began to laugh nervously, completely destroying the tone of the film. The film received terrible test scores at the screening, and as such, producer Patrice Ledoux and
1,11writer/director Luc Besson decided to cut the scene for theatrical release.

Sumi: WHOA!
alexxm: Well I didn't say a stink SHOULD be raised about it. Just I'm surprised that one wasen't. Not many people who would complain about such things would make the distinction of "he didn't want it," I don't think.
Leon will be very annoyed if you kill his banker.
SunderlandPony89 still the idea is that if not for that he'd do her

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original script had a much darker ending. After Stansfield shoots Leon, Mathilda performs the grenade ring trick (seen in one of the restored scenes of "Version Integrale") and opens her jacket to reveal the live grenades. It was changed by Luc Besson, fearing that the audience would not accept Mathilda's transformation from innocent girl to crazed juvenile
1,11killer. Besson had never intended such a transformation for the character.
what happened to putting it in a park
0,14and then leon was a plant

What movie next?
bye biophr34k
g2g evrypony
wmc.....does not apply to this movie
Night biophr34k.
See that? I was SWAT 7
We need to watch more Luc Besson movies.
bye HiImSpike
Also, symlinks allow for a lot of silly stuff in Linux / Ultrastar. I got Giggle at the Ghostlies in japanese, as an extra, running with a 720p background video, and taking only a mere 30kb extra space on the hard drive
See ya HiImSpike.
1,11Yeah, but it makes no sense in terms of her character. the entire movie showed she was a complete f*cking psycho shaped by her situation of living in a sh*t family.
ok pizza time be back in a few ^_^
MrPoniator_Laptop: a rambo parody
He made the most of his death
Love it
There really should be a Best Movie Clause
00,03Its something, Part Deux
Well, sleepy time now. Nightie night people, it's only 10 past 2 in the morning
00,10Clean/10
MrPoniator_Laptop: I am next, requested by Hot Shots: Part Deux
Matilda to Leon: I'm underage and want to make babies with you
|Master-Derpy|: click on bronystate. You get sent to a side channel by default
:)
never have i been for creeped out by a little girl before now
nope
Hot Shots: Part Deux.
that plant there...it wont be a tree it probably gunna grow like a fern
they need to make a movie of plant.
thats the prob
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=6GggY4TEYbk
The lottery is already closed! What gives?
oh shit
Nah but seriously... Q/Potato
Silverscreen: theres more to her that just craziness
kk
it dont work
Hot Shots: Part Deux is one of my favorite comedies
it will be epic
no idea, then
wrong link
howard the plant
Okay, even though I do like Season 1, the animation is a bit "flat" (especially in the background) and the writing, while okay, really isn't at its most polished. I really think Season 2 was an improvement, overall, despite more hit and miss writing.
it's a copmedy?
Makes me laugh every time
Dare I say, otakon x Matilda?
*comedy
I think, I have a new favourite film. 10/10
So we get a perfect movie, 2 great pony helpings, and a dump truck of Charlie sheen. Today tis truly a good day
refreasg=nope
the adventures of howard the plant
what movie is this?
AJ: STill an awesome link
Wait! The credits ddidn't say who the plant was? He was a FINE actor!
Leon
ScootaChicken: no
try /join bronystate? You're using bronystate.net chat?
AJ: :|
Good movie, derpy_pony!
Sorry to complain guys, but that's not fair to those of us who work full hours during the week.
PART 2 PANTS REVENG
Applewis: Léon: The Professional.
I can hardly wait for tomorrow's lottery
TheLaughingMan: I have to agree.
next is a comedy movie?
Unless there was notice in advance.
00,10a vine actor?
hm...
Wrek: You alive?
Pajaro: The BEST comedy movie
1,11COMING UP NEXT: MY LITTLE PONY, THE TICKET MASTER. STAY TUNED TO BRONYSTATE FOR MORE MOVIES AND PONY FUN!
fluttercry: pants revenge?
Matilda to Leon: I'm 12 years old and your....somewhere in your 40s I'd guess, lets be where babies come from
Ah, the didtant time before Charlie Sheen completely lost his mind...
I want to see Beauty and the Beast AND Passion Play.
*distant
MFW this song is by Sting
*you're
Sumica: Very Vine
PANTS!
sweeet
Pale_Horse: that time has never once existance
PONITIME
Oh. I don't even LIKE the early season 1. Too dry.
Like a Virgin lol
i feel really sorry for leon
plant: the next hitman
i love bronystate.
Why is the lottery already closed? I wanted to squeeze it in at the last minute!
Pale_Horse: "existed"
leave all chaannels then get ased to pick a channel : i put #bronystate [# is already there] but just rejects it
oh kewl am I just in time for the pony episode?
XAX_: Broken again.
I'm still a little speechless. I can see why the movie is as recognised as it is.
Plant was hot!
The Ticket Master. Keep a lookout for Rarity's wonky unicorn horn
I want to know why The Matrix trilogy wasn't in the newsletter.
otakon is best badass french penis
Plant is best actor
Theres one problem now.........THE CHATS OVER POPULATED
I have a man-crush on plant now.
The shape of Leons heart, is a sploded shape.
nope and im using bronystate.net
if he was a cleaner dosnt that make the little girl.... a maid
Comet: How so?
PONIES
Plant will always be in our hearts *Bows Head*
wheres plant the movie?
Matilda to Leon: Hey, I'm underage, and this is crazy, I'm Natalie Portman, so lets make babies?
lol
Best Hitplant
Comet: I say we cull the weaker chatters!
ScootaChicken: eeyup
what about Puppet Master, thats my favorite
i want an appendage that leads me to gemstones.
Hey guys, I finally found a person who has Bacteria Fetish!
1,11Aside from the ending, I thought it was an awesome and well done film. Especially one that only took four months to make.
Honey wagon?
no id
http://thetheologianscafe.xanga.com/762379308/half-eaten-sandwich/?page=1&jump=1525455900#1525455900
Plant should get his own sequal
ScootaChicken: THAT WAS NATALIE PORTMAN!?
This movie is brilliant. Everthing down to the music.
Max Playnt
Comet: far from it. This chat has PLENTY of breathing room. This ain't a pony ep stream.
idea*
otakon aren't you mad that Sunderland keeps calling you a penis
Dermathil: just got home from 10 hour work day... feet so tired I'm limping
sagas: I would have to agree, his emotion... his flare... he was fantastico
yh same
|Master-Derpy|, and clicking #bronystate doesnt work?
otakon: You're slow as molasses aren't you.
no
hehehe
04And now everyone, time for me to grab something to eat
IshSexyPony: eh, it's a term of endearmenat at this point
Silverscreen: That's amazing! :O
THAT TOOK ONLY 4 MONTHES TO MAKE???
Just found out there's a legitimate newspaper called the Hindustan Times.
One special effects guy for this entire film? He must've been busy.
In fact I think you'd lose to molasses.
SayWhat: A true actor. A master of his craft
Prince of mash potatos?!
i wish life was a silent movie
I think the ending shows that Leon is badass that he even saved a broken as hell girl
Bjornfot damn you
"Chevalier KAMEN" is Kamen rider I think
otakon x molasses
/me food is for the weak
Meanwhile: first time I've seen this movie in whole(mostly).
Come to think of it otakon, I think glaciers advance faster than you.
the plant later went on to play Treebeard and the Rape tree from Evil Dead
I'm gonna get some milk to eat
sagas: I know you can't tell this but... he was actually kinda hot
Otakon is still thirsty
ScootaChicken: bad bad
it's 2:14 in the morning.
MI9000: Yup. And it was made while another film was stuck in development hell. Ironically, this flim is better remembered than the other one.
arnt we speedy for 4 monthes
RX-78-Grimlock: nope
Shamroc: I'm such a rebel.
LEON DOSNT SLEEP HEWAITS
00,10nice credits music
I have a crush on Fluttershy!
/me pulls out bass cannon
Otakon is still thirsty
SayWhat: Ide tap dat
otakon Venus as a Boy
ahoy thar m'bronies
1,11It took him only 30 days to write the script, and the shoot lasted only 90 days. Ironically, Léon is now generally considered to be a far superior film to The Fifth Element.
HIPPIIIIIIIIIES
Let's all go to the lobby...
Bjornfot: dafuq?
The other one being the fantastic Fifth Element
Species have gone extinct faster than otakon's thought process.
IshSexyPony: At least I'm calling him badass
/me puts on sunglasses and leather jacket whilst playing a guitar riff
Phase4: |Master-Derpy| oh, the problem is that he is banned from #bronystate
I can imagine Plant leaping through a plate glass window dual-wielding pistols in slow motion as an explosion goes off behind him and doves fly around him in the background...
how's everyone doin tonight?
also does the Alien Trilogy start tomorrow?
1,11120 days. 4 months.
look at the ban list
good film
y?
Indeed. Even though the 5th element is a GREAT movie.
yup i love that irony
otter-can is still thirsty
/me puts cigarette in mouth
MEANwhile.
let me check
PONIES
LE FRENCH
0,14...dd the credits just say something about Kamen Rider

Bjornfot: I knooooow.

To break the love mood...ponies.
I am...the Lovable Prick, so YOUR GOING TO LOVE ME!!!

This is back when I didn't love the show
owlicious, i can't imagine why 6_9

oh season 1, thats so last year (JK)
seriously
Good news everypony , i perfected my meatballs , second batch was kinda bland , but these are delicious
LOOK LEON PLANT GREW TO MANY TREES
what idiot chose this episode
You can really notice animation differences between early S1 and S2. It has really improved over time. :)
looks like you got a 24h ban for spam earlier today under the name Jappleack
Phase4: i wish for the day we have a derpy side room
Princess Celestia should jjust fix her up on a date.
wtf is with Plants
*licks lips*
Also, this is when the actresses were still trying to get their characters down
Big apple.
NOM
hah
Yo, I happen to like this episode.

One nom bite, and its gone.
1,11Ever since I became a brony, I've been eating more apples.
SON OF A BITCH
um... guys, was it pointed out the listing on the front page is messed up? The winners are listed where the movie names should've been and vice-versa...
w8#
ships plat and Bloomberg
oh yeah I did
The GGG first mention
Why one is this, anyway?
lol.
HI EVERYONE! I got here just in time today!
O u.
Otakon is still thirsty
CELESTIA OF EQUESTRI
they got a decent budget for season 2
Meanwhile: who doesnt?
Plant x Apples
Princess Celestia of Equestria
a
I haven't eaten a single apple since I became a brony.
1,11Went through a whole pound in a week.
dear pesky plummers
OH THE GRAND GALLOPING GALA is the best place to be
and most of it went into the finale
RX-78-Grimlock: I am not stop sayng that
Wohooo
at the gala
AJ: What's with the name?
21st day of what?!?!
TROLLESTIA
Majesty! She's the sovereign! It's Your Majesty, not Your Highness!
THEY NEVER SAID THE MONTH. ONLY THE DAY.
hey Reikim hows your day been
My body is ready
S1 theme ftw!
Oh, of course.
Is this chat not dead?
first day of *dodges actually mentioning dates*
ill pass this ep
But Otakon, you are still thirsty.
otakon now that I know you hate Bjork, I'll quote her to you every now and again, and if I one day become a mod in the very distant future, I'll try to stream her just for you muahahhahahahah!!!!
It's part of the Dicord theme, Dermathil.
SPIKE! Y U NO TELL US THE PROPER DATE?!
er so i havnt even been on jappleack 2 day let along on the whole of this website
lol XAX
DocSane: I picked this episode :P
...I don't like this episode. I mean it's OKAY, but it's really not that eventful. I think "Feeling Pinkie Keen" was, for me, when the show picked up, because it went from a freakin' hilarious episode to something really dramatic and exciting, and did it WELL. The notice of everyone's favorite mailpony really sweetened the deal for me.
Trollestia's conception
Meanwhile: oh shit.. yea im RPing the aftermath of cupcakes with sarah
Oh... not of course. The ticket one, eh. Meh.
Bjornfot: umm lol
THEY DONT HAVE MONTHES!!!!
alexxm: Fairly good. Also I got here just in time for ponies 1, so bonus..
And thus was unintentionally born the concept of Trollestia
so we go from assassins to ponies
Silverscreen: btw what didnt you like about the movie ending
AJ: ....what?
FRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENDS!
I still cant stand the theme
MEXICOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
remember i was destroyer29699 playing games with u
Meanwhile: and i am applejack
only days
FRANCE
Friends.
This chat is not dead! Yay.
Celestia is such a Troll! SHE KNOW THAT TWI HAS 5 Friends! (6 + Spike) -_-
Gummy is best pet.
Ninjazz: -_- That shouldn't be an excuse for laziness, but eh.
yadh yadh IS the month
AJ: WAT.
so weird
IshSexyPony: not if I become a mod first and BAN BJORK QUOTES FOUREVER!
Comet: You aren't alone, man
AJ: Who the fuck is Sarah.
Boing boing boing :).
DAT SPIKE FACE
didn't watch ponies for a while
Twilight hopping is adorable.
:P
Spikenot amuzed
My dear Twilight Sparkle, You need to get laid. Your devoted teacher, Princess Celestia.
1,11Woodenshy|Facebook_a: This episode is rather important, as it sets up 2 other episodes, including the finale.
I'm kind of in the mood for some Transformers now...
Look, CONFLICT.
AJ is awfully excited about the gala
that's too unlikely of a coincidence.
spike isnt a friend hes a man slave
Reikim: that's a given
By the way Applejack gets first dibs on the ticket
Dermathil: It's not laziness if it's intentional. :D
You know
Meanwhile: Inet girlfriend trololo
otakon: You will never be a mod.
I think the early episodes are good as well, in their own way. There's not denying the whole feel of the show changed over time though.
The theme is the girliest part about the show
Reikim: says you
take note of my last post SunderlandPony89
/me noms on Pop Tarts.
Spike did skip the Gala
Nice, but do they blend?
Celestia: Has five friends; send two tickets
look again the tickets are now diamonds
DocSane: yes i am
Doesn't feel like it is intentional though.
Look Twilight, here's the bane of your existance. One ticket for you, and one for one of your five friends.
Silverscreen: whats the other ep
spike is not impressed with your shennigans
AJ: Uhhuh. She on here?
wouldn't twilight have known if spike had gone? O.o
SunderlandPony89: man if it turned out to be a specific date, bronies would schedule grand galloping gala conventions all over the world
Hey mods! Will otakon ever be a mod on here?
It sounded like she just sed 'glaaaaaad sex!'
I REALLY NEED THIS PONIES
I used to find the theme way too poppy for my tastes before I started watch MLP. Now I whistle it to myself. I am way too easily influenced.
Meanwhile: not on regulars
Dat consistancy
Berry Punch is going to the gala?
1,11Alicorn_Prince_Shane: The one with the GGG dresses.
THOSE BACKGROUND PONIES THAT STAND AND BLINK AND DO NOTING
Irony - only Applejack has a legit good reason to be there.
Fail, rich have snobby tastes
Meanwhile: but yea on bronystate
inkBot: True.... O.o
dat saggy old hip
saggy old hip
Reikim: Otakon will only be french, a penis, and still thirsty.
Their farm is always falling apart, I swear.
otakon you'll have to face an...Army of Me
AJ: Uhhuh. What's her nick?
Granny Smith looks close to death there.

Clopping.
Silverscreen: have i ever told u wat the name i get urs confused with

Renard: What is that? O.o
AND CELESTIA IS NOT A TROLL. She sent those for Spike and Twilight.
RD is a SPY?
fapping
wow i wonder who got me banned 4 something i dodnt do
Dat smile
Woah, I just noticed an error in the newsletter O_O
busy, nappin
Applejack has the waaaaaay better reason to go
otakon was a mod for like 10 seconds. He was the worst mod ever. Even worse than Saxy.
ARE YOU A SPY?
Applejack would give up Bucky McGilligudy? Isn't that one of her hindleg names?
Ashleigh Ball overhears Asheleigh Ball talking about the GGG
Meanwhile: trololo i think its cacence
otakon: You have no banmallet.
Oh RD... =_(\
SaxyPretender: <3
RD can sleep just about anywhere
0,14...
Silverscreen: I actually like Suited for Success. And the early episodes have an odd tone, I don't think it found its niche yet. Not as good as the latter half.
0,14hey
Ninjazz: 0_o trololol
0,14hey
RD = Blue spy
Sorry Applejack gets first dibs
ScootaChicken: I didn't KNOW I was a mod.

I AM A BANANA!

LYRA
What's mean Saxy?
0,14Hey, ScootaChicken, ARE YOU OKAY

and derpy has underped eyes
fluttercry: indeed.
HOLD ON twi's brother is a geniral of the roral gards why hasent she been to the gala?
But what about the T-P0N1?
XD
No, Rainbow Dash, the cops would throw you out
lawl
that derpuy
So awesome it can't be shown on screen.
SaxyPretender: XD
DERPY
Dat Face Expressions!
rd just flashed everypony
derpy
They have spectator seats at the Gala?
IshSexyPony: oh God make it stop...........oh wait I don't like Bjork so I have NO idea what you're on about.
Silverscreen: the first time i saw u in Bstate i saw it at Starscream
Meanwhile: but right now shes Twi
That RD one hit KO move
and lyra
what is buccaneer blaze
And at the Gala, she merely gets to meet them... briefly. Then she watches as they ignore her.
Is it any wonder Twillight was the only pony I didn't hate early on
Plot holes. Plot holes everywhere!
Buccaneer Blaze... clearly too incredible to be shown on screen
Funfact: Soarin is a Lt. Colonel in the RCAF
that for some reason creates a giant explosion?
Derpy before she was derped on purpose
considering I'm seeing bans for both your current IP and the one that falls under jappleack, I'm inclined to think you know
The writers didn't pick up on Derpy until later on
the filly flash is NSFTV
...Evidently.
lol insert Danger Zone theme
nope

otakon I'm talking about....Human Behavoir
This must've been written before the Sonic Rainboom was invented as her greatest move.
I would like to see Derpy get inducted into the Wonderbolts in a future Ep. and have RD get all envious over it. :P
AJ: It's Princess_Molestia isn't it.
the Filly Flash is NSFTV
Shining armor didn't exist then:$
nice spam brah
K_A, because I want to this the live log in the terminal (in order to check for any potential media errors)
lol this pony ep is so funny when u play satisfaction in the bg
Meanwhile: yes, yes it is
EggWhite: Apparently they do. The Wonderbolts mention that they'd just completed a show.
o yeah?
My mom hates cartoons. But she is watching this with me cuse she is bored :D
HOFFWRASSLE!
HOOF WRASTLE
I just had an idea. Maybe Celestia started the Gala the year after the NM incident, in order to help deal with nightmarish memories.
Silverscreen: yesh then i saw it as silver scream then Silverscreen
Renard: Oh, it doesn't output to stderr?
:D "A chance to **** the Wonderbolts!"
AJ: Well, good to know your rp habits actually have positive results.
1,11Om: New brony? New brony.
lol
RD would win...see "Fallweather Friends"
Ashleigh Ball must feel really confused considering how often she needs to argue with herself. :>
omg how could I miss this!
sorry I was just too excited
xD
Hello, I am sad.
Both fail horribly
Second season had a bad habit of forgetting that these are quadrapeds.
a chanse to fck the wonderbolts!!!!
/me slaps Meanwhile
At the gala, all the critters...
Meanwhile: like that?
im semi mad
apple jack's the best reason.
Om: Welcome her to dah herd. :D

I almost missed pony streaming
Silverscreen: We shall see.
applejacks reason is best
Om: My father watches this voluntarily
Randomnerd: in the garden
hi spike
only appljacks are good reasons
Guys, should I show my mom Sisterhooves Social to start her out?
Spike ridin dah PONY
MI9000: all of them!
Hey no need to be like that. I'm happy for you.
Midnight_Fyre: Celestia is best dictator
Om: HI OM'S MOM!!!
K_A, it might. It did not try. That's practical enough for me as this term is dedicated to the task :p

Guys, can I say that out of the "official" songs (Winter Wrap-up, at the Gala), I LOATHE "So Many Wonders?" Even though it has my favorite pony singing (and the first half's great), the mood swing, OH GOD THE MOOD SWING. It did NOT need to go all happy/cheery like that. It was...eeyuck.

ohhhhh THIS is why I don't like early season 1. I've seen all the clips on Youtube, so everything's spoiled!
They're in the early industrial age. They have machines and such
otakon: How so?
angel noms on ticket
Equestria has fairly close to modern tech, its just not common.
LIKE GHOST, FROM TRUE CAPITALIST RADIO, WHO IS A HAMMMBOONEEEEE
FLUTTERSHY TAUGHT ANGEL TO STEAL
Rarity is such an asshole in these early episodes. :P
I guess the Mane 6 represent teenagers
SHUDDUP Rarity

05,15Hell yeah. I've been watching the old Power Rangers episodes again, they're so awesome. Except for this one time when I saw some asian kid standing as tall as the megazord in a scene

Hey guys, Fluttershy is worst pony.
So graceful!
I didn't mind the So Many Wonders song, but that one line can almost be taken out of context as presenting Fluttershy as a Pegasus Supremacist
so huge
I HAVE A CRUSH OF FLUTTERSHY!
FLUTTER RAGE.
Alright Ghost you aare the new Rainbow Dash
Fluttershy, go watch T1-3 and report back.

SHUT UPPPPP
The pony bunch
Oatmeal! Are you crazy?
QUIET!
Dan_: Haha :D
Constant theme of this show: your friends will hurt you. All the time.
otakon: She's the least developed character out of the mane six, the least interesting, and the most one note. She's the character the writers call on to be either all defensless and doormaty or develop assertiveness.
otakon Bjork
hahah pinkie
dat Oatmeal
Reikim: I own a axe and have a beard
0,14I tried to get into Operation Overdrive, but I couldn't keep up

Bronysith: CHUG A MUG OF MEAD!

such strange diets
god.. Damn!
Silverscreen: Not sure
extra crispy, not stirred
otakon: because it was Twi and Twi is always cute.
/me picks a flower: she loves me, she doesn't , she loves me, she doesn't, she loves me
otakon: Applejack has pride and her own over the top sense of honour, as well as the fact she overworks herself. Sure she's less interesting than character's like Rarity/best pony, but she's still developed.
Silverscreen: So she's on unemployment checks?
Was that squee? O.o
00,10Woodenshy|Facebook_a, that makes no sence
i like those seats
otakon: no
she wouldve given the tickets to Fluttershy and Applejack!!!

Yeah. This isn't a good transition. We go from a movie in which a plant is treated with inordinate affection to an MLP episode where flowers are casually consumed.
SunderlandPony89: Also he's on fire now.
Now the universe is trolling Twilight.

Rarity!!! :$
Reikim Kamen Rider is a different series
I love Rarity
Sex happend behind that panel
Element of Generousity my flank
you trying*
k then
Rarity not modest
Kamen Rider is its own awesomeness
RARITY! <3
ADVENTURE TIME is not on netflix
Manipulation, stop it!
Silverscreen: I prefer what she makes later
Wow, Rarity suddenly went lesbian
Silverscreen: I can relate
You'll be the belle of the ball, the star of the show, i'll be the pony everypony should know
Bronysith: that sucks, good show.
otakon: People have wild ideas about you :P
Can I say that G1 is the second best series behind G4?
Suddenly?
Yum
all the bribery
Distortion: And so is Rainbow Dash. :P
Sure.
Silverscreen: No comparison to her actual gala gown.
Woodenshy|Facebook_a, Yes I agree
lunch?
otakon: suddenly? i thought she always was
Thanks for finally taking a hint, Twi.
dayum
Rarity is clopping to lesbfics all night.
Ninjazz: .exe has stoped working
What was G2? I've never heard of it?
Canon
IT'S GLORIOUS!!!
apple
nomnomnom
0,14o_o
Bronysith: no, that's RD
*.
LAUNCH
otakon: ...that wasn't a 2008 democratic primary reference was it?
otakon: I'll agree with that, I just think she's less likeable than the rest of them. Add that to being the least developed, and tada! Fluttershy is worst pony.
And then Twilight dies of overeating.
Woodenshy|Facebook_a: I disagree, I liked G3
Dem eyes
FOOD
Celestia just wanted Twilight to get a date!
otakon: same thing
sadly theres no Apple Sandvich
G2 was better than G3
Silverscreen: This show is slowly killing the testosterone in us and im okay with that
apple apples
G2 had no show
thanks applejack,now i'm hungry
Woodenshy|Facebook_a: JK :3
Apple things to infinity plus one.
G2 was a G1 focus at teenage girls
1,11DocSane: To be honest, I like that simple design over the over-done gala dress.
owlicious: MLP Tales wasn't G2.
04It technically belongs to AJ anyways
.-.
ANGER
friendship is apples and diabetes
Spectrum_Rush: Rarity is now offscreen... brain can funtion properly now.
give the ticket to plant
*is now hungry*
DocSane: oh
Twilight is the element of grumpiness. And hunger

04She was there with Twilight when she got the ticket
ScootaChicken: well, give her Season 3 and THEN we'll say least developed or not.
wow dat willpower
Shamroc: more like RAAAAGE
waaah
Love Rarity, but she does have one of the worst reasons for the gala XD
ScootaChicken BLASPHEMY!!!
Bronysith *hugs*
1,11Granted it doesn't look like a gala dress.
give it to leon and matlida
so thats a mabye
ScootaChicken: Please let's not discuss this.
I saw the G1 pilot and it was pretty good. Despite the songs being Big Lipped Alligator Moments (save for 1) and the pacing is pretty poor, It's still good. Megan's kinda hot...:s
G3 as mlp focuised at non-humans
it was one of those Standart Letters.
Inb4 awesome sample for YTPMV
Its entertaining how much my mom hates cartoons :D
CCCCCCP|AFK: HUGS
lalalalala
ScootaChicken: I agree.
dat theme song
G!
mlp theme
Silverscreen: I like Twilight's gown. It looks like space.
ded of eargasm
<3
/me crash glomps into CCCCCCP|AFK
Watch Fluttershy's wings as they flap. They de-synch over time.
dat tune
ahahahahah
That song
and then THEM SONE!
Om: How is she holding up now?
CINDERELLA
Desyunced wings
otakon: We've had two fucking seasons already, that's what, 56 episodes? Probably more?
Swag
that tune
Bronysith: yay
Silverscreen: it looks like somehing else:S
lol
Fluttershy! It's Pinkie's job to break the 4th wall! :O
ScootaChicken: none of the mane six is worst pony.
I love Fluttershy's voice
otakon: same to you, let's not discuss this.
its summer<3
jkkj
fluttershy
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: wub wub wub wub <3 that picture
Ghosties: :| Do I have to give you a hug, or does Dash deserve it?
dem books aren't going to fix themselves
fluttershy has best poker face
GOTTA LOVE FLUTTERHSY
owlicious: the only visual media of G2 was a computer game called My Little Pony: Friendship Gardens.
angel is a dick
ScootaChicken: it's only been like 36 actually
FLUTTERSHY
MY EARS...TOO...MUCH...ADORABLENESS
Attacks with cuteness<3
DuskStarshimmer: I kinda liked G2/Tales. It had a slice-of-life that wasn't particularly common back then.
I would have picked fluttershy :)
alexxm For me, Spike is more like a nicer Michael Cole
What is a Salad?
dawww
--- Angel is not ammused ---
smart rabbit
Cant read her polka face
XD
YellowBoring
abusivel ittle shit
Bronysith: agreed
dat brutal honesty
*slice-of-life angle
and the ticket
Wow, you guys are pretty sharp on some of these animation errors.
Angel is new element of honesty
1,11Angel Bunny is not amused.
lol
It was Angels plan all along ....dang wabbit
Serious rabbit is serious
If you guys keep debating best/worst pony, then I'm going to send you all to a custom room.
fluttercry: Ikr.
I think this is prolly the only good thing Angel's ever done for Fluttershy
Well, at least she was honest.
SONG
Well at least shes honest
That honesty
:P has anyone played the luna game
Moar singing!!!
G1 is good......but G4 OWNS THEM ALL
Angel Bunny is a douche.
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
K_A: FiM is very much a combination of G1 and MLP Tales.
ah right Dark92Engima so who would the undertaker be then
song
o_o
You know? Angel is being a good bunny here.
And then I'll ban you all just to be spiteful.
Ninjazz: Dunno, she left xD

Hooray!

Reikim: by custom room, you mean #TheMoon ?
PINKEEEEEEEH!
2 songs in one episode
PINKIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! (YES BRAIN?)
Pinkie!!!
We ALL know that Lauren Faust is actually best Pony
K_A: Slice of life morality tales ina fantasy setting
Pinkie apparantly has party-groupies. Who knew?
Mozdoc: It helps that an hour-long video on Youtube called Bloopers are Magic documents many of them.
back crack
04...dat feeling...when I realize that Little Sisters are kinda like Fluttershy
Just the relentless grabbing by her friends just gets hilarious.
0,14mfw we veered off from Power Rangers
XAX: Still broke. :(
season 3 needs more random pinkie songs in non pinkie episodes
Meanwhile: she is a great pony
dat wink
rape.
Fluttershy IS the least developed pony.
Love that part
And as far as I know, you aren't an IRCop
RRRAAAAAGGGGEEEE
one of those ponies was in a dress already

I love her mane
It's morphin' time!
Ninjazz: Cant blame her though, she is stressed
*colgate
Bennie Hill!

Okay, how many kids get the Benny Hill reference? Or that it's also parodying A Hard Day's Night?
CAPITALIZE THESE FOOLS FOR I PITY THE FOOL
RUNNNNNN!!!!!!!11111
I'll wash your dishes... WITH WUBS
twilight run!
Lies. That'd actually be Pinkie.
DocSane: Indeed, it really does have aspects of both.
lesserpoet: I hear that there's going to be a song in almost every episode of S3
Dat Benny Hill
I could tolerate Pinkie until "Party of One". THEN she got aggravating. REALLY aggravating. "A friend in Deed" is my least favorite episode of the series.
*cue Benny Hill theme*
Now Twilight knows what the Beatles went through
Ninjazz: i remember seeing the fluttershy on youtube with a laughing track it was awesome.
Lyra can save you
Tyrannosaurus!
Bennie Hill :)
SHE' GOT A GOLDEN TICKET

Spike crossdressing...
Silverscreen: what about a friend in deed?
i wonder if that was intended as a wakfu reference
twilight troll
Om: Ah, well. It is what it is. Hope she feels better later on.
BENNY HILL FTW
SilverScreen: What about the GRAND GALLOPING GALA? That had at least 2 songs.
Ninjazz: i wasnt here pre-show. i was 7 minutes late.

You didn't see, but I totally struck a morphing pose.
Hey, there's the clown wig from Nightmare Night.
STAY BACK YOU MONSTERS
DERPY
XAX: Then yes, he did show that one.
isnt it ironic with the pony that has a carrot cutie mark spots twilight, since carrots improve vision
otakon: The shy ones always have massive tits.
Why didn't she do that in the first place?
MeanRanger: shes less popular than derpy
Kandarihu: I hope that's true... that would be amazing
Although apparently huge rack = motherly in some cultures
1,11Really? It's been a while since I seen those ones.
0,14also, the reason why Time Force is my favorite may or may not have i part to with the fact that it had a Red Ranger named Alex >.>
poor spike
TERRORIST PREVENTION
Suddenly nighttime
SilverScreen: A Friend in Deed had a bunch of songs, albeit very short ones

ScootaChicken: eeyup
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
/me screams
THEYRE EVERYWHERE!
otakon: I have no idea. I heard something about her being "motherly" due to her nurturing nature
MeanRanger: everypony is less popular than derpy
SaxyPretender: heh
otakon huge rack = silicon
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
00,10notice how it's night time
CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
You know, ice cream is rich in calcium, protein, and vitamin A.
Cedirdor2: I think she couldn't teleport until then.
Ninjazz: Doubt it, the week aint over. And the worst has yet to happen. But I thank you for your concern
NO ESCAPE!
MLP:FiM has "Jimmy Hart versions" of a lot of famous tunes.
Twilight. Stop teleporting through Hell. It summons too many Cacodaemons. :(
breaking and entering
Bronysith: Apparently not~
IshSexyPony: the hell you say
notice the diffrnse between that teleport and the end of season 2 on how easy it is
Why are they all up in her bedroom?!
Trollestia is fueled by your torment
pOOR TWILIGHT
Burn the tickets!!!
Isn't that the truth? Ponies everywhere, even when you don't want them to be.
Silverscreen: yeah smile smile smile yanky dooodle dandy and the welcome song
1,11EVERYONE needs to back off of twilight!
"YAY! The ticket is all mine!" - Rainbow Dash
twilight sugar
burn notice pls
They all snuck into the library while Twilight was running from everyone
Om: It's the least I can do, man.
IshSexyPony: so fluttershy has mane extensions AND implants?
00,10why are they all in twi's bedroom?

Sumica: Secret Butt Fun
sigh
Thats my Rainbow Dash, taking advantage of others good will!
no ticket for rd!!!!!!
ohh RD
Then why'd you do that in the first place?
/me hugs Twilight_Sparkle
lolnope
Oh, Dash... :|
selfish
otakon: Irony? Fluttershy is usually modest, so having large features would be ironic I guess
*sigh*
Rainbow...
Dash is best judge of mood
Selfish Rainbow Dash
LOL RD
Like a baws
yay

This is why Rainbow Dash is my least favorite of the Mane 6.
RD is such a bitch sometimes
S2 haters: Behold your allegedly ruined character showing her selfish side.
SaxyPretender: It's nothing you haven't seen in THAT skype group.
I honestly think that Princess Celestia made an honest mistake.
IshSexyPony: NO, a woman can have a large natural bust without augmentation goddammit
ungung
scratch that

Unstated lesson: USE YOUR CONNECTIONS TO HELP YOUR FRIENDS

Damnit, Renard!
IshSexyPony: I have a friend like that actually
Also, what do you guys think about lemons?
o-o
otakon yeah, its called a fat chick
TANTALIZING
IshSexyPony: remember the CMC ep with the Gabby Gums column? One of the articles was "fluttershy has mane extensions"
hse probably intended the ticket for spike
Celestia was a jerk in this episode
TAKE DOWN A NOTE, PHRASE CATCHER
I like lemons.
Kandarihu: Prolly, but it's much more fun to think otherwise
derp
how much did i missed?
IshSexyPony: Wow.
Lemons are the best
THESE PONY EPISODES ARE TO DARN SHORT:[
You magnifecent bastard, I READ YOUR BOOK!
a lot
And here Princess Celestia is going "oh, was there a problem? Here then, have enough tickets for everyone."
inkBot: That seems legit
Why didnt you just ask!?
Kandarihu well the letter seemed more genric perhaps someone else sent it
00,10accell comes out around 8pst, korra is saterdays
no ticket for spike :D
ScootaChicken shaddap you lemon stealing whore.
RX-78-Grimlock: so true
geez.
(Seriously, she's the personal protoge of the leader of the land. She can comp them a few tickets.)
RX-78-Grimlock: If you were a lemon, I would put you on my shelf and cherish you like I cherish all my lemons.
Group Hug
NO SHIT SHERLOCKSHY
Docsane : Best lesson ever
IshSexyPony: THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH A SO CALLED "FAT" CHICK GODDAMMIT! WOMEN ARE MEANT TO HAVE SOME CUSHION AND NOT BE A STICK GODDAMMIT!
cue Trollestia
Just like a boy
ahahahahahha
She wants to spend the gala with her friends
Well Celestia is a few thousand years old she may have become a bit senile.
XD
Anyway. This is a great episode.
Princess Celestia TROLOLOLOLOLO
I've got a golden tiiiiiiiiicket
Apple Jack, you sexist!
otakon: AGREED /)
Oh god the otarage
Trollestia strikes again!!
lol
Just like a first grader
TROLLESTIA Strikes Again!
00,10the speed of this letter tells you she was trolling all along

applejack = sexist
Except Spike.
Trolololololololestia
Sumica: Oh, I forgot, is it you who streams Korra?
inb4 the gala was cancelled
to be honest this is my least favorite episode
Screw Spike.
"Dead Twilight; TROLOLOLOLOLOL" - Love Trollestia
Cedridor: trollestia first appearnce
"Can't Enjoy myself without you" And in the actual Episode she doesn't spend any time with them at the gala
How they carry the tickets with magic if thet aren't all unicorns?
grumbly in the tumbly
ScootaChicken Otarage needs more french spam while he tries to find pooland
MeanRanger: nothing wrong with big bottomed girls
Magic levitating tickets
I've got a golden twiiiinkle in my eyyyye
Dear
Time for din-din
Oh yeah, the endings really seem thrown in. Example: Celestia: "What'd you learn twilight?" Twilight: "I learned about X"! Celestia" Very good Twilight. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. SHE. APPEARS.
that she sends an extra ticket to spike after sending the other 6 supports my hypothesis
HOW ARE THEY DOING THAT
...Okay, I'm going to need someone to teach me how to mod.
00,10yeah Blaze
"This piece of paper is a ticket" - Trollestia
they're all unicorns
sad spike...
Celestia must have Dragon to write up a letter that fast.
otakon: they make the rockin' world go round.
OH wait you have friends now! here you go more tickiets
