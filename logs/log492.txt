Spikenot amuzed
1,11Woodenshy|Facebook_a: This episode is rather important, as it sets up 2 other episodes, including the finale.
I'm kind of in the mood for some Transformers now...
Look, CONFLICT.
that's too unlikely of a coincidence.
spike isnt a friend hes a man slave
You know
I think the early episodes are good as well, in their own way. There's not denying the whole feel of the show changed over time though.
The theme is the girliest part about the show
/me noms on Pop Tarts.
Nice, but do they blend?
Celestia: Has five friends; send two tickets
look again the tickets are now diamonds
Doesn't feel like it is intentional though.
wouldn't twilight have known if spike had gone? O.o
It sounded like she just sed 'glaaaaaad sex!'
I REALLY NEED THIS PONIES

Irony - only Applejack has a legit good reason to be there.

Dear
Time for din-din
Oh yeah, the endings really seem thrown in. Example: Celestia: "What'd you learn twilight?" Twilight: "I learned about X"! Celestia" Very good Twilight. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. SHE. APPEARS.
that she sends an extra ticket to spike after sending the other 6 supports my hypothesis
HOW ARE THEY DOING THAT
...Okay, I'm going to need someone to teach me how to mod.
00,10yeah Blaze
they're all unicorns
