08,01i don't normally emotionally identify with film violence
08,01but i do with that film
08,01:(
0,14but...Guillermo del Toro!
08,01it does have some horrid scenes, but it's a great film
11,01As long as the bad parts aren't over-the-top.
08,01they're not
11,01Then we're OK.
00,10guess i better screen that one carefully
Pan's Labyrinth is fine
08,01it's not like it's Last King of Scotland
EMMA WATSON NEKKID YAY
00,10it might just get vitoed later
00,10any ways on to B
00,10number 37 Vordox with Airplane(1980~)

Reikim: you should go see The Perks of Being a Wallflower
she will get naked in 20 shades of gray
thats a perfect excuse to go and watch that shit
...Wait
No
We are not discussing that
it's 50 shades of grey, and I don't believe she's actually in that.
That book
00,10while you do that lets get the pony eps out the way
11,01Feb. 10, 2012.
50 20
That book and everything to do with it
ITS THE FUCKING SAME
We are not discussing it
00,10ah well past 6 months
00,10ok
11,01Yep.
but seriously, Emma Watson looks to be really good in Perks of Being a Wallflower
00,10first pony ep is number 87 Welsh_Pony with Bridle Gossip
00,10second ep is
she shows boobs in that movie?
O_o
00,10number 14 jangledorf who picked It's About Time
I leave the chat for a couple of seconds and it all goes to nekkid? :D
no, but she does apparently take part in a burlesque show
/me flips table
ITS NOT ENOUGH
O.o
Boobs are not everything.
So SaxyPretender|Dinner you going to mention that Airplane was an A last time?
50 shades of gray is not a good portrayal of BDSM
00,10ah, shame
That reminds me of a good song i found earlier today, ima go have a listen
0,14It was mentioned Meanwhile
0,14:3
00,10seems Airplane was showen as an A movie last time
Just checking.

0,14if Day After Tomorrow was a B, then this definately is
00,10for some reason yeah disasters are B movies
11,01I consider them A or B.

00,10you know, I feel bad wining on my drawing

Aiplane GTFO'd
it's just booooooooring
08,01i only enjoyed it because of the banter in here
Phase4 is late too!?
Look, it got a 39 on RT.
2012 is a C movie
C for CRAP
Thus, it's B.
Because they spelt Aeroplane wrong, and because we streamed it as A last time too. :P
00,10aroplain
No complaining about "Is this an A or a B" until the mods finally provide clearcut an objective rules for what defines an A or B movie.
Reikim: and it grossed 769 MILLION dollars.
Hahaha, 2012
08,01Rariplane
^ Bretty good 5/5
RAWR, we don't go by that anymore.
00,10right then let the bitching commence
The mods changed the system.
MFW bayformers 4 is being made
Im very grateful to that movie :D
08,01brace yourselves
We're using RT now because it's faster and causes less arguments.

minecraft music
THREE HOURS AND TWENTY MINUTES
night Colt_Brovakiin
Yep
dat buffer
but seriously, if people are choosing bad movies, choose bad movies that are at least entertaining in their shittiness
dari best get out the booze for that movie.
Pan is amazing. Try to be here if you haven't seen it somehow.
what movie's next?
00,10dabi plez
Yikes! I nearly forgot about the B movie!
Night Colt_Brovakiin :)
We're not dead.
3 hours and 20 minutes...isn't that how long Endhiran was?
2012 drinking game
Maybe now people will put Odyssey in the lottery
00,02and aparently Pan's Labyrinth is a
/me bets his car title, his Mac, AND his tablet AND all his drawing skills that the world will not end when they Mayans say it will. Guaranteed bet.
I missed the lottery!
Me and you Ash
Yes.
OohShiny: A 3 hour and 20 min one
00,10yes dabi it's 3h 20 min
WAAAAAAH I WANTED AIRPLANE AND PAN'S LABYRINTH
I'll try to get some money together.
LotR style/]
?
OohShiny: It's called Color of Music
08,01well, i did point it out last week how long it was when it was picked
MrBen: Vordox, LordDerpington, Sumica, jangledorf won.
2012 is a bloated, overlong, horribly acted, terribly shot, load of computer Generated shit spat out by a film maker who stopped giving a fuck years ago.
Phase4 and for ponies
well at the current rate of decline by next month it might be down to like 50 entrys
and worst of all, it's boooooooooooooring
This is the reason why i dont choose a 'B' movie
Once again, we run into the fun fact that unless it's blatantly told how the mods define A or B movie, other people will continually surprise them with different expectation for if one movie is an A movie.
HogFather is pretty good too.
08,01it's The Colour of Magic, and it's based on the first and second Discworld books by Terry Pratchett
inb4 toot
08,01and it's very, very good
Inb4 Toot spam
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I was just going back in the chat to see what movies were chosen
I always put 'N/A' in the survey for B
See ya in three hours Discord

Wow, no toots .-.

I'm so full of whiskey, cheese, crackers, sausage and chocolate right now - this was a good night :)

Hi, Everlasting_Joy! :)
As the speed of light is lower than the speed of the star orbiting Discworld, this made it technically a tachyon.

Is that....
Howdy Tim Curry.
11,01Yay Tim Curry.

I do believe so
why do wizards are always portrayed as old men?
this gon b gud
ghandolff's evil twin
Huzzah Tim Curry.
00,10dat eye roll
Sweet! :D
harry potter
A Tim Curry character I'm sure he is not a villain<_<
RINCEWIND!
00,10get on with it
I love Tim Curry!!
OohShiny: You make a good point. Curry's at least not old.
it takes hundreds of years to be a wizard
GET ON WITH ET
the books were written long before harry potter, LunasGuard
A Wizard is never late - He arrives precisely when he means to
:D
"Get on with it. YES, get on with it! YES, GET ON WITH IT"
duh hayull? O.o;
You know what's also really badass about Pratchett?
Oh hey there Dr Frankenfurter.
Tim Curry, obvious bad guy is obvious
His "Discworld for Kids" books...aren't really for kids.
somepony_else: so wat is this?
^
At least, not in the traditional way.
08,01...
08,01it's not The Unseen University
00,10it's like he talks out his nose
I WANT THIS SO BAD!
08,01it's just Unseesn University
Tiffany Aching's adventures have quite a bit of adult meaning to them.
08,01*Unseen
LunasGuard: A movie based on one of Terry Pratchet's Discworld novels.
tim curry?
the colour of magic... based on terry pratchetts first two books
00,10not the hat
I can so hear Delboy.
:3 Take a shot every time "Did anyone get the number of that Donkey Cart" is asked

"It's only been 40 years!"
not the hat
TF2
11,01In school for 40 years? Worse than me.

....did that tooth just sparkle?
RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
Why does that sound like tim Curry?
The sorting hat had his head dyed after Harry Potter ended
08,01ASoftFluffyThing: it is Tim Curry
...Artemis.
00,10so many team kills
because it is tim curry, AdamTheDuck
ASoftFluffyThing: But it WAS Tim Curry

SPY!
08,01Ridcully is best Archchancellor
why do I keep thinking his name is Arthur?
ZE WIZARD IZ A SPY!
He stole his slippers :O
that last a good while
08,01i don't think he's in this one, though
have they made an Artemis Fowl movie yet?
So when are we going to see some magic?
Any music from the intermission is pretty ambient
I want to see Death show up.
Like By The Bay
11,01At least he got to keep the hat.
nope, still in development hell
Everlasting_Joy: Your guess is as good as mine, bud.
Everlasting_Joy: when the credits begin
00,10oh hey I was wrong the movie is not 3h20 min long
development hell? tell me more
noooooo

HEY.. im enjoying this movie
Gandalf the Red

Cypresswolf-: Well, it would be the best kind of magic, the end credits are a magic to bad movies.
00,10Meanwhile in skyrim
It's Deadpool!

00,02 death is disapoint
Discworld's Death is the best Death ever.
That voice. . . That was awesome!

Well that was disturbing.
shogipony: You just missed him
RAWRity: Agreed.
It's less a movie and more a miniseries.

The truck is best character.

Meeting him would be reassuring.
Every since the 'Ring' went on sale, people have been buying it left and right x_x
I dont get it
they all speak english why is it so hard for them to understand each other
Twoflower doesn't.
00,10oi
Two fingers backwards doesn't mean peace anywhere

I love how his accent disappears when he says his name.
Satire, remember?
00,10........lolwut?
Correspondence course, totally legit.
Twoflower. Manly name.
Seems Legit.
I think the joke at the expense of the hated Yank is prefereable to a racist "satire" of asians.
00,10Unseen, must see
08,01i've seen people do it!
...
Must see...
What's Twoflower's cutie mark?

He's just hanging with Death
snake,wolves and a fall
so is he really a wizard, or is he just a poser?

It does so by being a lot heavier then the rest because it's filled with gold.

is this discworld?
Yeah, that one.
Truthfully, not even Death knows exactly when Rincewind will die.
00,10nice door
no, she has freaking dragons on her side
nice key
Man Death really hates rincewind in the books
And then Rincewind took a handful of gold coins as compensation
what's the name of that movie that the guy plays chess with death for his soul?
The elder scrolls told of their return
I'm under the impression this is how most Terry Pratchett books turn out.
the color of magic
this looks like an entertaining series
Cause his hourglass is all messed up
Spike would like to have word with you, red guy
I wonder what Rincewind's hourglass looks like.
bingo!
XD
Most Pratchett books end...
...
OohShiny: The Seventh Seal, one of my favorites.
Well they all end differently.
I missed so much I haven't learned their names yet
i have heard tales of the cheeseborn
DocSane: thanks
Dken2021: not even an umbreon?

The Colour of Magic ends on a literal Cliffhanger because there's a second book.

so just tuned in to this movie, anything making sense yet?
well yeah
Tim Curry is Tim Curry
Curry is awesome
he's wonderful
Starts with a Deus Ex Machina that's actually quite well explained and then goes on from there.
00,10Lets say he is ambiious

Sumica: Recirculates

Because I liek cookies
Spntaneous generation?
edge of the world say BAI BAI
So if the world is flat and the water just spills over the edge....whered does the water come from
00,10yep a fence
*Spontaneous
Sumica: Water always generates from the center of Discworld and then falls into space.
I would think going over the edge of the world would be on the BOTTOM of the bucket list
...do you perhaps taste like cookies now?
The water comes from shutupit'smagic. :|
XD
LOL
lol I brought a book
Well Columbus was full of shit, the world is flat
Hiya Death!
the world is round their is no up or down
00,10dont mind me, I got a book to read.
no
:D
twilight is death
...that would of worked better if this was Earth
The chest is PISSED
Water generates, because people assume it does. Magic works by not understanding. That's why noone bothers to figure out where the water comes from.
I taste like something you don't like the taste of

Round planets are NOT nonsense. They're just built differently than the Discworld is all.
Dark92Enigma: I'm actually working right now. I can't see the movie. I've been through the same thing. I became a brony around early April, and it took me until about August to tell my parents.

Huh
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I told my mom, then got her to watch a few episodes iwth me. XD
I just realised why the gender of the turtle matters
Oh dear.
DocSane: why is this movie closer to a DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS movie, THAN THE ACTUAL FILM!????

DocSane: Society and their opinions on your behavior. It affects most people.
Let's start this turtle sexing!

*What

DocSane: Not that I'm aware of. Well, I think there was a stage version.
doctor zayus
i almost forgot about monky boy
Ooh, help me, Dr. Zaius.
doctor_whooves127: Actually, that's the university Librarian.
He's technically only obligated to answer three questions, but he usualy answers whater the summoners wish to know in one go, since he dislikes being forced into repeated summonings.
What?
13best client
08,01why is he pronouncing "ook" as if it's Dutch?
that would be dope..COOL if the turttle was actually one big cow..
That would be lolvely
doctor_whooves127: Ohhh, Dr. Zaius Dr. Zaius♪ Dr. Zaius Dr. Zaius♪ Dr. Zaius Dr. Zaius, ohhh Dr. Zaius♪

Why are their SMGs so much more powerful than mine?
13get a box you can turn into a headless linux server
13then irrsi + screen

Just what I was thinking. My new PC could handle it :P

its a mimic
I like sex and violence!
Oh man, I love sex and violence!
Violent sex is best sex
I shall not
Bread?
dose this site also show mlp episodes regularly or only on relese dates
I own a hat like Twoflower's.
I am a big fan of Sax and Violins. :D
Is saying bread instead of bed a thing now?
Sticks and stones may break my bones but whips and chains excite me.
A friend of mine referred to it as a birth control hat.
we show mlp tales regularly

Ponies47: You have to understand, this is a world where the gods aren't so much worshipped as blamed, and where those same gods are fond of going about throwing bricks at the windows of innocent atheists.
but asked him why, he just said he's playing a game
what the hell is BF3?

The guy who was coming through smashed into the door on the driver's side
He just wants someone to have tea with.
hey a Pale_Horse
lol, a revolving door

Just because he's Death is no reason to be impolite. Least you could do is stay for tea.
lol
This was a good gig.
it was terrifying; I seriously thought I was going to die when he was coming at us
yea
this is quite enjoyable
I DO NOT HUG
no huging:'(
You can't die of Death. :|

The bronies

I wasn't supposed to get work study this year, but I went and talked to them and they gave me $1700 of it =/
Ded.
I thought you saw the picture
dont think to hard you might hurt sompony
I saw a really tiny picture
we should watch Galidor sometime
Hm
I don't really understand work study
oh dear
It's like government aid
oh no, no teeth
Hell, even Mane is pretty quiet.
but you can only get it by working for the university
lol
...
dude, get some wooden teeth
HA
Oh he gets teeth.
ivory teeth
so what's the advantage of that over just getting a job on campus?
from the cut
He definitely gets teeth.
there really isn't one
some jobs just require it I guess
Yeah, except that
He gets a very nice set of teeth.
he should get a gold grill
he will have a great time shitting by the fire then
The only things you can do on my campus that aren't work study are food service
I don't know if I even have it or not
His smile becomes, shall we say, brilliant.
hogwarts?
that's what I'm doing!
Alright my ponies, I must leave for now. I should be back for the ponies though. :)

Bai Klumzeedragon ;3
I amputated it
bye Klumzeedragon
goodbye Klumzeedragon
remember SFRB's being dropped in pink milk?
DocSane: Eventually Death stops caring, and accepts that Rincewind will eventually pass-- but he's not going to worry about it any more.
Lol yeah
And out it goes
Bye, Klumzeedragon. :)
well now they just have to save the world

Kencolt: Yh but Death is an awesome character

Aw come on, it was fun
Its only lights
yeah it was
When is Death not awesome?
If its not made in the microwave, i burn it.

I made brownies once. They tasted like (Squee)
turtles are nice
D'aaaaaaawwww
that was a long time ago
Ill misjudge that shit and wait until the thing turns black
so is that why they cared if the turtle was male or female? i was kinda afk
baby diskworlds
yep
Wait, the turtles are born with elephants on their backs?
d'aaaaaaaw
I'm old!
And then new world's were born
00,10well, guess that solves the gender issue
aaaaaaaaaaaaw
You're not even 20 yet lol
Wait, it's a female turtle?
space turtles
Megalomanic: With a world on the elephant
its a girl!
rainbow dash's is still 20% cooler though
A'wwww
Sadly, most of the babies will be eaten by cosmic predators. Some before they even reach the edge of the universe... :(
Oh dear.
hrmmmm...I suppose I need to tell my contact to write a fanfiction now...
...? Don't take that picture!!! Dx
only a few months
yeah if you EVER take a picture this whole time, get one now
If it's a girl, then you know what that means...
True
d'aaaaaawwww
I tried making glaze once and they ended up burnt, it took a long time to scrape off the burnt sugar, and the house ended up smelling like it for awhile

I was more thinking.
lol fix the camera
Pasta.
hey don't mock starswirl she made over 200 original spells
That it's going to be on bottom when it finds a male turtle.
You are moving away from it
Pasta is the best thing to cook.
mother nature symbolism
And they're on its back.
And that is how Equestria was formed.
Inb4 he misses the whole thing
. . .
suddenly: Sun :3
He did

00,10booooo
dohoho
00,10bad pun
Wooden..
So, the most interaction I've had with this one girl is her telling me I'm her friend. I was wearing an Arch Enemy shirt at the time, apparently liking metal gets you instant friendship with her, I'm questioning whether or not I should go for it.
Lol
I love that luggage.
-_(\
twist....
We all like that luggage
hahaha
da...........?
O.o
Why not? lol
Poor wizards
no

Not anymore
dohoho theyre deade
The Planet of the Apes
Then they overtake all the humans
Don't worry Death isn't a huge thing there
I'm actually reallly surprised how many people still come here from "the old days"
Wait a minute if that star is the symbol of wizards is that why Twilight has it on her cutie mark
Well, I'm not sure whether or not I wan't to. On one hand she likes metal, on the other hand, she's a bit of a...um....emo
Goodbye Twoflower
How do the Discworld Turtles have sex to make the eggs???
yeah, me too
Tassadork: Basically yeah
My OC is supposed to be a stallion but mose pictures I has of him, he is a she. Dem R63 OC's.
feel kind of bad for ditching
BoulderDash: magic?
this network is almost totally abandoned
Ish: You should go for her
except for this channel
Magic
00,10the same way normal turtles do
BoulderDash: Maybe it's asexual reproduction.
*most
Um
No
Sad Rincewind
Ok maybe
Why are you making snap decisions now
Twoflower is actually from a sort of pastiche China/Japan. Fourecks is pretty much Austrailia.
BoulderDash: very clumsy
Is sad
well the space turttle mom laies here eggs. the nthe space turrtle dad comes and fertalises the eggs
Ponies47 at least you aren't Paleo
Ish, play it cool and just be friends for a while.
*cough*hitandquitit*cough*
I had to ditch because SR got mad at me lol
AlienWarhead: Like Krogan >_<
Don't you think inhabitants would notice giant eggs being left behind by the turtle?
Freakin' -magic- space turtles.
I shouldn't even be trying. I have never had a girlfriend
well i must say this was a good movie both parts
If you don't find she pulls at you in a romantic way you can at least still be friends.
LOL xD
what else is new
Must have been a poor priest.
so what are we watching?
:P
not that
ponys
BoulderDash: First time it's happened in recorded history for them
Thn they became giant Ninja Space Turtles
What? I'm only 14. Gimme a break damnit. .-.
It happened like 2 years ago
What was it?
Now he denies that it happened though, go figure
[GOLD]
Oh god, so that's how Micheal Bay's Alien Ninja Turtles come from
Gold I guess..
lots,lots and lots of gold
is required to see this response
The luggage
I got my first gf after freshman year :P
Tassadork: Twoflower is from a sort of mixed Japan/China, and Fourecks is pretty much Austrailia.
fine for you then
maybe he just doesn't remember
that's just who he is
and thinks I ditched for no apparent reason
otakon17: I guess it only happens once in any world's history.
This is, in actuality, a better gift than the gold
Lasted until the end of Junior year :D
cant admit he's wrong
ooooh, Luggage (goo)
If a bit more psychotic
I'm a wittle high school freshman
I can't judge now really
The Luggage loves Rincewind by the wag, fiercely in fact.
haven't talked to him in years
But boy was she a Btich! haha
Luggage has saved your life so many times
Me either until like a week ago
It would be useful
Eeyup
Pale_Horse: Rincewind is of two minds about that, you see...
stay gold pony boy
lol
otakon17, I smell a slashfic...
And Luggage is awesome
Outsiders?
I've danced with a girl. And she was cute :>
He doesn't seem that much different
except he likes ponies
OMG THE OUTSIDERS IS AWESOME
Silver_Spoon: You'd be surprised
D'awwwwww. Manhug
I didn't see that one coming
THats a start :$
Luggage is like raincloud
I READ THE BOOK

Sumica: Lol what?
except dari and me
i blame tim curry
I was hanging out with this ROTC girl sophmore year at high school, but I wasn't that into her, in fact, she was really ditzy and spontaneous
It is Terry Pratchett
It's not "Goodbye"... It's "See you later..."
My bro is 19 almost 20 and hasnt had a gf :\

dawww
:D
:'( Can I keep Luggage?
yay
Lol
Yeah, services used to crap out all the time
there we go
See?
otakon17: The single most magnificent bastard in the entire Discworld series, the Patrician. The only man who comes close is Samuel Vimes. He's not as much of a bastard, but he's pretty high on the magnificent.
Happy luggage!
RaveBrony: I'm in Minnesota, all of the conventions are 1000 miles away.
the new marlin
RaveBrony: It's so true. At Canterlot Gardens I talked to so many girls.
Kencolt: Ah neat thanks
Why can't luggage be Twilight's pet instead of Owlicious?
At least.
I suppose I'll join the never had a GF club, I'm 2o btw
lol
Everlasting_Joy: Aw damn.... I know that feel T~T
The End?
It'd carry her books...
Go to a public place wearing a pony shirt, get swarmed by girls :>
Luggage would be a better Owicious

Kurra: Nice! :)

Sumica: You'll like the series. A note-- the "real" Colour of Magic is actually a collection of four short stories, and the second-- The Light Fantastic-- is the plotline that's truly advanced in this film.
So are we watching what is likely to be another 20 minutes of alternate endings?
Your recent trip, Ponies47??

It especially does when you're afraid of balloons
how do they forget that hedges are just buchs, you know bushes, those things you can walk through (he doesn't say you can't)

Longest movie night ever
im_texting_my_dog: Shuda up and watch
AJIsAwesome, last year, they were joking about a hypothetical evil version of them who collect donations to torture children instead of helping them.
I guess the new version of that would be the Skylanders fantards
pony_300: She think that patch of cloud is Cloudsdale.
humor
>_><_<
I think this may rate as the longest BMN ever-- or a contender at the least. (Not counting speial events.
Sumica: dont see the point in the i phone
pony_300 she thinks one cloud = cloudsdale
GTG EVERYPONY IMA GO PLAY HL2

Coldays: They aren't powerful enough on their own to even challenge Discord
they've had really sad lives
:(
so now that twilight is anti twilight and the opposit of magic is science ANTI TWILIGHT IS THE ELEMENT OF SCIENCE
I love discord, he's just trying to have some fun
I landed a retail since september, course since it's a new store, there hasn't been much hours for the manager's been giving
^
The without friends who needs enemies thing was depressing...
I'm wondering if I should even bother trying to revive this place
The_Awesomeness: but she likes science too
Her element is magic...she got discorded she can still use her magic?...I don't get it.
well thats a fail of its own
Withdraw Arrow
I really DID think they were gonna go for the "I have no more enemies and am bored with that" angle
AlienWarhead: dont know harleys voice to well, but iirc it was just sort of in the middle between those two modes
pony_300: if they were to just give him some fun for a little hed be alright
Lazy celestia
Poor spike
poor Spike
pain
00,10notice all the letters are un opened

Peace will be upon you soon
My mother said high school was the best time of her life. No she's wrong. Highschool is hell and it sucks. If you were in my shoes you would know why .-.

RAin cloud is all grey!
Also I have had to talk to the schools social worker, guidance counselor, and therapist about my problems .-.

Sumica: was it fail, or inception like trolling... since I still can't be kicked :p
BIG DUMB MEANY

Adrenaline Rush.
Fluttershy can actually fly!

dat R2
whats next
donutpop365: Lol
And He'll back in Season 3
youd think after a major disaster like dicord everyone would be dead or something
I feel like the only reason I ever fit in here was because I knew SR
cow334: If you compare statue 1 and statue 2 you realise that the first time he expected to be sealed-- and he's in SHEER HORROR the second time.
YAY
Celestia = leia?
I REQUEST A NEW HOPE THRONE ROOM SCENE xD
He'll be back*
defeat Star Trek villian, get Star Wars ending

These staff members at my school are idiots. They don't need to be concerned for me. They just need to do there jobs and teach me. That's why they are called teachers
And he made me a mod so everyone had to respect me
Kencolt: Ah, now I see.
Is chat dead?
Spectrum_Rush: Seem Legit
AJIsAwesome: Only thing I can think of is the sisters got him when he was off guard
Nope.

well if you're like that, I don't blame them, but ultimately, it's your decision if you want to branch out and meet people. Probably in their opinion, they see the quiet shy student as having trouble fitting in and might do poorly in school

What the...hell...is going on?
Even originally?
I sit alone during my study halls. Blasting brony music into my ears not giving a crap if they hear it or not. With lunch I just sit with old classmates of mine from middle school they never really liked me but I have no were else to sit. Classes I just sit there and get taught by the teavhers and such.
I suppose we could just start it off with just us

oh gracias mi dio
Hoixsoft said he plans to buy the rights to Spyro if he can. No clue how he's gonna pull that off. Maybe after activisions done, they'll sell the rights to him maybe?

I have always held that Q wuold NOT get along with Discord. "Jean Luc, no matter how... annoying... you may find my actions, you must admit I always have a reason. Perhaps not one you really understand, but a reason. But this... thing? As much reason and a fish with a bycycle. Which I have seen, by the way. It's rather pathetic."
gozila too
its kojira

Iz Gozzila!!

00,10how many of you just test that i wonder
00,10should still be up
I was about to, but burst into laughter instead
and ohai everyone :P
Sumica: i smiled saying it
hi AdamTheDuck
do moar sfm
and im not lying ethier
this is one of the coolest Source things i've seen
the Pony/TF2 crossover community frightens me.
it makes me SMILE SMILE SMILE :D
The other day I was BLASTING "Smile Smile Smile" into my ears at school. It was so loud you didn't even need to have the earbuds on to hear it :P
yay ^_^
OH MY GOD
that was hilarious
YESYESYEYSYEYSYEYSYEYSY
all of my freakinyeses
I wub Fluttershy <3
form the PMV to this DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
This song
...
O,O
BUFFER NOOOOO!
this reminds me of a TF2 mod calld Freak Fortress 2, where one person is a boss, or "hale", and the others try to kill the hale
one of the hales is Fluttershy
with an OP minigun
lol
fuck it im plaiyng this song as well in class and see what other kids think then say its from MLP FIM see if they change thier opinion
and this plays
00,10best to not force it on otheres Quick_Thinker
dat song + fluttershy's voice = <3 :)
00,10many fans are ones that just gave in on there own and decided to see waht it was all about
what happened?
For some reason the part where Fluttershy is whining and shaking her head doesn't look right to me since the eyes stay fixiated looking straight...
Sumica: I know. Saw stuff about it? Got curious, noticed I had the Hub, watched a few eps... and here this old man is.
e we go
00,10it's how I converted
i did not "give in" i saw it on youtube and thought well i loved Power Puff and Fosters so lets see what Laurens been doing. Then well loved it
but what happened strangely it passed by me quickly
00,10saw a saturation of it for months
party soft
00,10finaly asked wtf it was about
I'm going to be doing on how cartoons have changed through out the years. I can't just focus on MLP FiM but my plans are I will include atleast a paragraph about the whoel brony thing and such :3
00,10got an anser figured meh
then when i was felling "blue" i by some luck found SMILE SMILE SMILE and "blues" GONE
*doing a report
00,10later on youtube showed me anthology
I can tell you one thing-- the work needed to make these models is scary.
Ponies47 i did a speech on bronies in school
its entitled
Brony Speech in School
I cant even remember when i started watching
Quick_Thinker: I wish I could do that. If I ever get the chance I will
this one is good
me either
I was pretty judgemental of the show, but didn't say anything out loud in respect for one of my awesome friends who was a brony.
it are broke
or not
Sumica: Same here. Heard about Derpy, got cruious, looked it up, got interested in the fact the animators put it as an easter egg for the fans, heard they actually called her Derpy, saw the chat reaction video, came here the next week and that was it
00,10some day we might just see sfm being used for pony eps
Oh, yeah... How to totally misunderstand orders.
woot :)
and suddenly Pinkie Pie
/me Shrugs "Who knows Sumica?"
hi

You may want to check out the rules before you unintentionally get banned like half the other new people http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
stupid auto kick bot
OK
Quick_Thinker: You have NO IDEA of the often insane talent from some PMV makers. YET.
00,10suppose i should make a dropbox account for those that want my desktop pony
i think i do
Quick_Thinker better than getting banned for it
i'm kinda tired too NocturnalBlade
i think i'm still kind of drunk
lol
You're tired? I've been up for 30 hours
ShyBetaFemale: :D from partying lol, still?
30? O.O

Sumica: Lot's a people want it. Because she looks awesome ;3;
Fr
Sumica: that would certainly be nice of ya
00,10yeah the old version of the spam kick banned after 3 kicks

Right Now!

Sumica: lol otakon mustve not enjoyed that
probely should have played Discord
NocturnalBlade, pffft, sleep is for the weak

Sumica you should bring that back for one day just to piss off otakon.
Quick_Thinker: You mean that one with the Pinkie mod and Smile Smile Smile?
00,10most of us did not know it did that till him

inb4 flushed
poor derpy :(

sfm has made garry's mod almost useless for vid making
suffered massive crush damage
Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
:O
about right there heavy
:O
thats where you went wrong
this is more like the place you go if you can't get it on your boob tube
:S
Blitzwing: well not hasbro-like official, but its streamed here
.-.
00,10very few of the old ones I have were ever posted on eqd.
or are just lazy
So much wat
Blitzwing: If you have the actual Hub, watch there-- usually better quality. Or here, half of Europe comes here to watch premeres.
yikes
Blitzwing this is the official place to come when you want an hour to seem like 15 minutes. And yes, ponies.
Thanks for the info
np
Ponies on BronyState? There be no ponies here. >_>
lol
00,10we should have a page timere up for new eps soon

Not again AdamTheDuck.
00,10yeah i belive that will be the time we use as well
what if i'm against it

11,02Hai :3
FIW :)
this song so catchy!
00,10it was recorded Kencolt
I can sing Pinkie's Gypsy Bard perfectly. Is that a bad sign?
dis song <3

00,10in fact it got us alot of viewers
NocturnalBlade: DA has been working fine for me.
Sumica: I KNOW.
i love this song, another fav of mine

Sumica: Like me

00,10what do you guys think?
I saw the crew of FiW at Canterlot Gardens

00,10FiW ep?

i don't care
yep
altho i need to go soon
Sumica: 1st one?
man damn
/me votes for FiW

Quick_Thinker: Every panel atleast one person would ask for a hug.
Sumica: that could work lol
11,02Sumica: O3O
yes cherry bomb
What is this witchcraft you speak of?
00,10nice duckface super
Hey Sumica you guys wanted a banner timer, why not just stick Pony Countdown's banner up there above the chat? http://ponycountdown.com/
Just before I leave to play tekkit. Does anyone want to join me? It's okay if not.
Blitzwing: you shall see lol
i got a drink from Andrew Francis (not beer silly fill :3)
Sumica: Actually, I'm not fond of FiW. Guess age has rendered it's humor stale to me. Well, that and I'm the resident old fart, so I have to have something to gripe about.
Sumica well, if you don't know what "Pinkie's Gypsy Bard" is and you can say "Raincloud" without feeling slightly emotional, either you haven't watched FiW or you simply don't care for it that much (such as myself).
00,10yeah J_E_Smith71 it's not a simple stick it in
idk, i love fiw
00,10needs to be formated to fit else it looks like ass
woooow old song
I'm blue de ba da
Whayaaai
Whih viddeo is this?
This song is so throwing me back into my childhood
D:

Vordox: Blue by Eifel 65
any body rember Zero9teen?
I'm too young to be phazed by this :(
KNEW I heard it. :D
The first time I ever heard this song-- believe it or not-- was an anime music video about Sailor Mercury.
Sumica: But didn't you have something like that already back in Season2? Why not just reuse whatever banner you had back then?
Sumica: OH! Sumi! Have you seen Hellsing IX yet?
00,10cause the old site is dead J_E_Smith71
00,10remember around the end of s2 we upgraded the site
i will be right back guys
guys i'm sad i didn't get to take a girl home with me last night :(
so are you still able to pull all the chat rooms out for a big crazy chat box
I remember the song from Now that what i call music 4
00,10yeah you can pop out chats still
my plan for my recordings of Bronystate is the mane 6 boxs surround the Episode box
Quick_Thinker: Like TroIIesia does
