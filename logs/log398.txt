04Now I remember
/me noms on the newsletter
10Anyway
you can't survive a nuke...nor can an ark melt your fucking face off
and he still takes the nazi monkey with him
Magnetic Gunpowder what???
YOUR SHIELD, IT'S MADE OF BABIES

Indy is from candia
Damn, she IS dead
USE THE KIDS AS A SHIELD MONKEY!
uhoh
kingqball: Oh I'm sorry bro
they give a reason for the Ark, it talks to god, the Fridge did not talk to god though.
This is easily the worst few days I've ever personally experienced.
Why do you guys hate the .movs so much?
/me grins evilly
Hai Phase4. Although I've been here for the past Ionnohowlong.
You spelt *stupid* wrong kingqball. Just sayin'
Abu, y u bad guy? ;_;
/me nomz JoJo

Ninjazz: i dont hate them
trolol
seriously, who's the Arabian Cyclops?
nah its just that its not allowed
ya
It'll get better before it gets worse Meanwhile
13we don't know that, the fridge may have talked to god enough to save indy's sorry butt
teh .movs are stupid
agreed
Apple.mov was good, the others are just trying too hard.
Im knot stooped!
CCCP neither did I
I don't know about APPLE though
The fridge was lead-lined, don't forget.
StinkomanFan: It bucking well better or I'm going to the doctors.
That fridge was probably the best damn thing
and in the 3rd movie, indy survies falling off a cliff
i liked shed.mov. that one was fun#
I KNOW I SPELLED WRONG BECuse i can't spell worth shit...FUCK YOU CAPS LOCK!!
Isn't it the other way around StinkomanFan? It'll get worse before it'll get better?
with no explnation for how he lived
the other.. meh
Red always means poison!
Have the Mythbusters tested the nuke proof fridge yet?
bud shed was nice
hot sauce
/me noms IshSexiestPony back
The Fridge didnt help in Fallout there were corpses in them
Dress was the worse
kingqball: Whoa bro calm down, smoke one

/me hugz JoJo
Shut up Inglorious

THAT KID IS A SPY
Right there we go lets see if that worked

I'll never forget the IMDb forum for Indy 4 the weekend it came out. All Friday night it was nothing but posts about refrigerators
Whe does he fall off a cliff?
/me hugs IshSexiestPony back
1,3apple was ok, dress was pushing it, shed went too far, so please don't bring up shed on bronystate channels
EVERYONE SHUT UP ABOUT .MOVS
Problem, StinkomanFan?
Everybody in this movie is a spy
I remember the tank goes off a cliff but not with Indy.
/me lickz JoJo
Even Indy
GOD-LEAD. My theory was that lead talks to god. And the radiation would kill him in seconds after the left the fridge anywho.
i've got my wii idiling on ssbb's spectate thing

IngloriousPony89: if my problem is worse when I wake up I'm holding you personally responsible.
04:/
APPLE is fine.....I always needed a daily dose of Epilepsy
i thought people went nuts for the .mov's
/me nomz, hugz, and lickz Bjornfot
10They were asshole-ish lots of times
kingqball: Smoke while killing ppl on tf2
its about a(believed to be)alien artifact!no wonder they added the alien,guys,so.....USE YOUR BRAINS!!!
/me Just realized he fell for trolling again.
.movs are great... but its for adults
So we cant even diss .movs? I can do that, i didnt like the other 2
Meanwhile: If it makes you feel better, bro

Ninjazz So long as he doesn't end up replacing Harrison Ford within the next 10 years, I can tolerate him.
I rate this movie 56-46 / (8+2)0 .......wait somethings wrong
The Last Crusade. Best Indy movie ever
NOW I HAS THE CHAT
speilberg directed it
RanTakumo, I once put together a huge list of things wrong with that movie. Suffice it to say, there were a lot of things bad about it, not just the fridge
RanYakumo: It's Indiana Jones. If I really need to further explain that then there is something fundamentally wrong with you.
Agreed
Darf14... you divided by 0...

10As Robert Rodriguez tells it, after conceiving of the character Machete and telling Danny Trejo about it, Danny started calling him at random hours of the day to convince him to make the film. One day, Robert said to Danny that he was busy and asked why Danny can't just send a text message instead of constantly calling, to which Danny Trejo replied: "Machete don't text." As he did a
10minute ago :P
