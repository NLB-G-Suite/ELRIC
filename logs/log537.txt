So not only are the worms getting more intelligent, they're becoming great shots.

For creatures who attack from below the ground, they sure like to pop up a few feet away from their targets.

Are they retarded?
SHOOT IT!

1,11So that's where the ending for the Alaskan Bull Worm episode came from.
8,6weren't the flying ones in the prequel too?
Eww... :9
good thing that cliff was randomly there.
They can't really decide on what blood looks like in this film.
I'VE GOT A GODDAMN PLAN
pumpkin smashing!
And then the car from Black Sheep smashes onto him
Let the disappoint that Melvin did not die begin.\
but wait...Melvin's still alive!
@kirzstryfe lol

Sumica 3
God damn it WHY IS MELVIN ALIVE
Inb4 giant worm sheep.

And then they laughed
And that's why they couldn't rely on a single wave of attack; the worms were learning, so tehy had to outsmart them.
Sumica: 2, I believe.
melvin dies, everyone is happy
hue hue hue
Melvin :I
the end
yuk yuk yuk
melvins alive... well ain't this the shittiest movie ever

Me too
Don't worry, Melvin will die someday
Jsprang1 - because the filmmakers hate us
Jspang1: because it's not supposed to have a happy ending.
Jspang1: he earned his survival in the end.
Silverscreen: If only....
better or worse than Attack the Block?
And then Melvin was eaten by aliens the end.
You cold get an over hyped History Channel Documentary with 4% actual content! :)

RUN LIKE GODDAMN BASTARDS
GUYS, SEARCH TREMORS IN GOOGLE! THE COVER ART IS A RIPOFF OF JAWS
Silverscreen: Yup.
ha
A movie was a good movie
Silverscreen: This was definitely better than the Final Fantasy film. Hell, the action scenes were more appropriate for Final Fantasy than the ones in Spirits Within.
Guys, I'ma go now
Silverscreen I AGREE!
Silverscreen well you guys kept debating back and forth last week on switching these movies
Bye~
I'm on here on my ipod app

Dear Princess Celestia, considering that giant man-eating worms, horrifying ghost-aliens and the spirit of an alien world live underneath the earth's crust, I've come to the conclusion that dirt is evil and should be banished to the moon.

03hm
03let's try using Cobra CFW and modding it using PS3MFW builder
03xD
03so far it appears to be working
03which is quite hila8rious
03-8
8,6which one TheGreatAndPowerfulT?
trixie and twilight kirzstryfe
8,6cool
Why?
;s
execute unsigned packages?
03^
03basically
haha
Twilight kirzstryfe :p
03Cobra is a bu
03whoops
butt?
03Cobra is a bunch of elitist hackers
buttery
oh
8,6imokwithis
03they managed to modify the firmware so that you can play PS2 ISos off the hard drive
03but
03in'order to make money
8,6:3
p-o
03they mdae a $40 USB dongle
03that you have to use
03otherwise it doesn't work
wow
That's cheap
03and if you don't have it plugged in, it acts just like the stock firmware (as in, no patches for unsigned code)
03so what I tried
spent half the week watching Doctor Who On Demand. First time watching.
03was modding it to allow unsigned cod
03e
03hopefully it'll make it patched with or without the dongle
03so I only need the USB dongle to play PS2 games
:s
Sounds crazy
Pics?
8,6Dr Who has some good episodes

en francais!
and it's in french, then again' it's always been in french
... ok, this song is significantly better in French.
Songs usually are better in their original language
8,6the instrumental version I had got lost somewhere in the last 7 years or so
This song annoyed me when it came on and I didn't like the show either
notbad.jpg
It was
hmm
8,6but I do prefer the French to the English version
but the XL had it prebundeled
err spelloing
I love the theme song, wasn't crazy about the show itself
/me looks for random stuff
the OP in English is... not good, IMO.
in French, this is quite tolerable
12DSi has it prebundled too :U

0,14niiiiice, kirz
This song lacks swing
GabeMoist agreed, that genre is very dry of ponies when everyone else is focused on trance or electronic
more jazz... hm.
0,14Jazz is good
indeed
I love the simplicity of these lyrics, they really get right to the point
I like jazz with swing

that shatner album got *one* listen and that was too much for me
0,14oh man
0,14it's Voltaire
Anyone in the chat wear glasses?
is something wrong with the bronystate channels? fluttershy isn't letting me in and says invite only
10 points for saxy
I'm not sure why I'm liking this song, but I am
God bless Voltaire
the side channels are closed now, rakka
oh
whyfor
well im off until the website's chat window is working again
0,14side rooms are closed when BMN isn't on
AttackWithHugs: I do, although I don't really _need_ to except for driving really
oh i see
just heard the william shatner rocket man, wow that was... ughh
0,14also,fun fact, Voltaire lives in NYC
hen3ry: I need mines all the time. Nearsightedness :D

OH GOD WAT
oh geez
0,14...Oh God, what have I wrought.
8,6:3
I blame Saxy for this as well
Mr. Tambarine Man?!
thank Celestia for the mute button
And I'll be, your Tambourine Girl
as a kite...ok
I dont hear music
of course it's not as bad as Leonard Nimoy's bilbo baggins song
That Derpy looks cool
I hear it now
No. Bilbo Baggins may have been the worst thing ever recorded.
8,6the music's low, unless the sound cut out completely
no it's not cut off
0,14rocket maan
FYI: shatner recorded an entire album of songs about space. this is only one of them. this man butchers major tom
0,14I'm sorry everyone ;________;
Who on Celestia's earth.....
the man butchers everything when there's no scenery to chew
hen#ry: I don't think I've ever made it through that whole song (or this one, for that matter)
.....is this cruel
Why hasn't he gone to trial for murder!
why the hel did I hi the shift key there?
science, too hard to understand
s'ok
SaxyJanitor, why does everyone blame you for everything?
probably the same reason I misspelled half the words in that las tsentence
looks cool. Like having an extra "x" in my name
0,14He can save us money on hotel fares, but not our ears
Saxy, what is this?
0,14also, the blaming me joke came from an Oregon Trail stream
get that man some scenery, stat.
A Rock it man?
8,6it's pretty bad to watch too
aaaaaaaaah!
Saxy, you gave everyone Dyssentery?
SaxyJanitor: I was about to bring the Oregon Trail thing up, too. I was there when it happened. It wasn't your fault.
0,14everyone died, and Vi wrote on the epitaph "I balme sxyprtndr"
0,14>.>
and I keep thinking of Stewie Griffin's version of Shatner's version of Elton John's... nevermind!
/me is nervous at how people will react to his pick.
0,14She saw fit to blame me XD
Maybe its a good thing I never win the lottery.
0,14I am happy to take the blame for this though
Vi balmes you and doesn't afraid of anything
and connection still spazzing, guess I'll go, have a nice night everyone
GabeMoist: NO, they were crossing a river and everyone died and Saxy got the blame for it, even though it was beyond his control
0,14later Dke- aww
No, it was perfectly within Saxy's control
If it wasn't, we couldn't blame him
SaxyJanitor: You can't control whether a river is hungry or not. That's like blaming a toddler for a volcanic eruption.
Later Dken2021
but he was blamed, therefore it was in his control
0,14...So I shouldn't have gotten angry at that baby then?
0,14>.>
clearly that toddler wasn't a proper virgin sacrifice, the gods were angry
I thought this was Zelda's Lullaby for a sec
SaxyJanitor: No, you shouldn't have.
0,14...Oh boy.
next time don't go with a Hilton
hen3ry: What? Did I miss out on something here??
Saxy is sacrificing toddlers?
GabeMoist: No, he's not sacrificing anything.
0,14O_O
Saxy is awesomesauce
like I said, pharmacist. Odd sense of humor at times. :/
oh
that explains everything
breathe surround mix, but it might sound a bit crap
upscale+additional samples/tracks.
This is classy

Hi, Ponies47
it means "take one tablet by mouth every day as needed to treat diabeetus." Doctors combine ridiculuous (often latin based) abbreviations with chickenscratch to make the magic happen.

XAX: Anything your mind wants!
For some reason... I can't log in with my Big_Macintosh_1992...
Oh mai
sharon apple you heard me right
the original vocaloid
Uh, isn't Sharon Apple a Vocaloid 3?
XAX: do you have a world file? I'd like to see!
what? no she's from Macross Plus
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7auKvJ_k5k
Uh, that's a different company...
uhhh that video may be partially nsfw
Crypton owns Vocaloid, if I'm not mistaken.
it's not meant to be a serious statement...
8,6no video links please rakka
hello MahBoi777
sharon apple is an AI singer in Macross Plus, an anime ova made in 1994 way before vocaloid ever came out
wheres mrPoniator he has my sandvich
Oh TM Revolution, I don't know what instruments go into making your music, all I know is it's loud and annoyingly catchy.
MahBoi777, are you ready to bomb some dodongos
Big_Mac_1992: i do have the world file, but sadly i'm capped on internet until tomorrow, so it will take hours to upload ;(
i think it will at least. my upload speed is crap anyway, so...
hey pony_9502, Big_Mac_1992, and GabeMoist
oh, that's ok XAX
But, technically, Sharon Apple isn't a Vocaloid, she's LIKE a Vocaloid, rakka.

03is there a very light Linux distro (I'm talking a computer from 1996 with a 160MHz processor and 60MB of RAM) that could basically sync the motherboard clock to a NTP server?

Your Twitter RP account sucks if it has a fan shipping. :I
.
8,6lol
hehehe
So, are we going to be watching bronycon?
8,6I don't think anyone was planning on restreaming anything, if that's what you're wondering
Damn
Looks like I'll be focussing on EFR then
Hey everypony
/me is now bullfighting
Hey d3rb
(\ Evil_Spike
im off for now...later everypony
mIRC sure does suck
bye HatchetRyda
/)
Use XChat
much better?
It's what I use
interesting segue
kirzstryfe: where is my request?
Yay, Miku. :3
Sounds autotuned
Miku isn't a real person. :P
It isn't even a real voice
So it's just the autotune without the voice
8,6thought I had gotten it, it's in the line now
Sounds like it
o-o
Add Super ATA + RAID 0
;p
(Not SATA)
Miku is pretty much a voice synthesizer
kirzstryfe: pink floyed
floyd*
8,6yes, I'm aware of that
xchat....why i no understand you?!
03heh
03Win7 won't install :P
/me pats d3rb on the back
i just want to use asomething other than mIRC! I'm irc retarded lol
o oo o o o oo ooo o o oo oo o oo o oo o o
I mean
....
/me is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
/me is ded
/me isn't really ded
i dream of the day i can sleep whilst eatting
;D
ACS13123...are you a zombie?!
SuperBrony64 :3
d3rb: nope, im a TF2 class :p
wubwubwub....
Oh, this is nice
00,02dat sleep woona
Dat Phase4
:p
00,02with the window open
wubssalsaddashwubwubljashlsadsaljadwub
00,02that seems inadvisable
inb4 Molestia o_o
This song has no swing
00,02GabeMoist, explain?
no flow or rythem GabeMoist?
like that jazzy swing
that compells you to snap your fingers and dance
and whatnot
8,6that was the random song I picked out because I forgot to queue up the next request after Pink Floyd
That pic. That's what I call epic wub time
thunder storm startin up
why not
03RMA
03*RAM
;<
oh
03it said you need 512M
03*MB
;-;
YOU CAN BOOTLEG
Ohwell
03woah what
not really
03the golden tanooki suit
03what's that do
what about my other requests
:O
oh
that
dunno
haven't played Mario 3D land
in ages
8,6quit whining and wait your turn, there were a number of requests tonight
"Stop whining"
lawl
I shouldn't have waited as long as I did to make my request. The only one I'm whining to is myself.
03If you die five times in a level, the Super Tanooki Suit will appear in the form of a gold and white, shiny and sparkly Super Leaf. When you use the special leaf, you will find yourself in an invincible Tanooki Suit, which lasts until the end of the level. While enemies cannot harm you in this form, Mario can still die by falling off of cliffs, into lava, or into poison water.
03pfft
03they made the game too easy :P
zelda oot is best game ever
yeah
;s
keep on drawing or sleep...
I love this song!
anyone willing to give a bit of input on a drawing im working on
so no TF2 tonight?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT , draw
it's so cheesy
I think you skipped one.
(yes I understand all the math)
8,6I'm not playing the HeMan song
Okay.
d3rb but my hammock is too confy..
8,6I wanna hammock
/me gives kirzstryfe a hammock

lol, love that pic
And Twilight Sparkle's consulting a guide.
8,6there are a few funny poker pictures people have done, but most of them can't be shown on stream
:3 saucy poker?
Oh, you cut that one off early.
d3rb goes from saucy to rule 34 but yeah
8,6will have to restart that song in a minute, wasn't loading up fast enough
I see
8,6there are a couple of strip poker ones, either humanized or anthro, and most of them have fluttershy winning
the only 34 i will recognise is the nissan r34 skyline
bwahahaha!
d3rb, lol
cause fluttershy is best at poker, no one can read her poker face
and now you have lady gaga on your mind :3
p p p p p p p poker face
dammit!
Well, in this pic, Rainbow Dash is winning.
Anyway must sleep, goodnight everyone :3

Btw kirzstryfe thanks for streaming music requests :D
I liked that Bass Muffins song
8,6:)
8,6Bass Muffin popped up in one of the eqd song posts last week or the week before
You skipped Nirvana too.
8,6no, I didn't :p
Hey everypony :P

it has such an auditive Hallucination in french
Guys, lets just enjoy the music and not worry about orders and song requests. They will play when they play if they play.
Ah, okay.
an hilarious one at that
dat loading
i easiest way to solve a song you dont like is to mute and play your own music *the more you know*
d3rb got the right idea
I CANNOT UNHEAR
Hai SuperBrony64
I wasn't complaining about the music that's going on.
Yay SuperBrony64! Again! :P
/me glomps Rain
i wasnt ditrecting that at anyone Kandarihu
/me hugs Sumica ^_^

Sorry
/me ist poked
/me Dries Om|wet of

This sounds like it'll be good
I think my request is going to be after this one.

Fragrance of Dark Coffee in jazz
Godot's theme song

awesome
/me imagines Shizuka playing this while standing and leaned over infront of her comp so she can dance around a bit while she plays :3
00,02i hate when theres one right at the end
13let's see if fmle can handle high priority...
11,02False alarm
that was my first guess "it's probably some drunk guy" lol
13i don't understand how it does so much worse at audiosurf than procaster did...
13and why so dead...
00,02you get more points for missing it, but missing a block is D:
11,02Thought that last message was a red ping for me but was actually a hot pink Shizu message :3
/me glomps Shizuka

00,02slower than the word, but still
sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net is a facebook image server

00,02hmm, still seizing a bit
i thought it was kefka's theme sorta...
00,02Shizuka, try turning off resizing in vhscreencap, that helps with lag
01,04Hush now...quiet now...
SuperBrony64: :O
11,02:o
SuperBrony64: That red text scares me...
oh oh SuperBrony64 is angreh!!!

Lol
there seems to be a hint of sarcsm in your message SuperBrony64...
11,02But seriously, all I want is a hug from Sumica O~O
/me hugs Sumica
/me hugs SuperBrony64
11,02^-^
00,02best in the world!
13doesn't seem like fmle is doing any better...
yay mods hug! :3
00,02Shizuka, you have to restart the capture
00,02its kinda fiddly, vhscr gives very little direct feedback
00,02on another note: if you havent played quantum conundrum, do so now
00,02as in close this window, open steam, buy it now
11,02{*~Ponies47~*}
SuperBrony64: Yes? :3

01,04hen3ry: Only the blood that pours from your enemy's heart drowns out the sorrow from your mind...and only left...is true fear

What is this song????
00,02dear god sb
O~O
Please tell me :/
PLEASE
11,02^-^
Shizuka if you want a crazy hard song for audiosurf, razor edge - hard beat
ahhhhhhh
Dont hurt me SuperBrony64... That Red text scares me...
SB is having fun xD
ACS13123: it's from the youtube video "1000 people pressed the suscribe button by accident"
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaa aaa aaaa aaaa
00,02s/\w/a/g << valid sed command
SuperBrony64: That's a bit deep, even for me. I mean, I may sing about eating babies, but I don't actually barbeque em
lol xD
00,02basicaly, it does what Mutterguy typed
I've been humming this in my head for ages
crazy
boom boom boom
00,02replaces every 'word' character [a-zA-Z0-9] with a
ah, vi, will thou never cease to yield thy secrets?
11,02Eating babies is just gross...and its literal meaning isn't the same as its actual meaning :)
00,02Shizuka hit a block? must be a physics bug
you know, I just realized that could be taken in a way more disturbing than baby pot pie, so... eww.
I thought baby was the other white meat?
what if the babies were made of chocolate?
that's racist, KiwiBoi777
11,02WHAT IF BABIES WERE MADE OF PEOPLE
HUH?
:O
Woah.
yeah, go on, eat the little brown babies first. xD
SuperBrony64: wow dude that is deep
TT_TT
00,02fun fact: you can cheat the scoreboard, i'm not sure how much of a problem it is or how they combat it
/me bakes potato_pony
mmmmm baked potatoes
00,02Shizuka, whats the bitrate?
13300
lol
13going to drop to 250 now
13i'm well below what procaster was capable of
mmm.... baked!
00,02i dont think thats the problem
sour cream is nasty. true story
00,02how i wish there were open source replacments for the crap you need to stream
i've had sour cream go bad
00,10I presume you are making sure fmle imput matches game size yes shizu?
Phase4: you know, that's a good point. How is it that there AREN'T yet?
lol
00,02cher3ry, i suspect its cause no one can figure the screencap bit
00,02you can just use WM_PRINT iirc, but thats epic slow
13give me some time..
11,02Daily Fun Tip #1: When bored, yell the word 'SLIIIINKKKYYYYY' really loud outside your window while pointing up at the sun.
seems like it should be a matter of creating a virtual monitor, and sending the desired video data there.
00,02SuperBrony64, ....why
11,02FUN
then again, I never programmed in a graphical environment, only in text terminals, so what do I know.
he's got a poin
00,02cher3ry, its not that simple
*point
well yeah, compression..
Good night all
00,02cher3ry, i meen in theory all you need to do is read from the framebuffer, but the crap gpu makers have made over the years
11,02Night Kandarihu :)
00,02night Kandarihu
gnight Kandarihu
00,10yeah I could show you how well that looks cher3ry
00,02there we go
00,02that works
do it one night when people are asking for ponis, Sumi. I think massive deinterlacing could really make worlds biggest tea party more interesting.
00,10now if only we all had lunas conection
00,10If we had that we could set keyframe to realtime
00,02Shizuka, decrease the keyframe interval, it'll look worse but should be smoother
The 1 minute buffer would be doable Sumica?
or is it 2 mins because you got to beam it back?
00,10Cant say for sure till I got a look at shizus settings
/me bursts into flames
00,10But I think she's too focused on the game to notice.
lol
..the zone...
00,10Oh and lower keframe interval will increase bandwith useage Phase4
00,10but it is better for fast games like this and Knights one SuperBrony64 likes to play
13i know what the problem is
00,10or Nights
13asuka is at 80C
00,02oh
00,02that could allso be a problem
dat your lappy?
13scrcap is capturing 1280x720 at 15fps, not resizing
13FMLE is taking in 1280x720 outputting 640x480 at 250kbps
just 20 more and I can boil my ramen noodles on your CPU. Load ALL the programs!
13audio 64kbps
13as you can see, it's still horribly worse than what procaster could do
00,0280c is a little high
00,02why so hot?
13ventilation is a foreign concept in this house
13there is nowhere for the heat to go
00,02ah...
even if it's hot inside your house... there's no way it's 80 C.
hmm
im in?
did the webchat crash?
dats not my name O_O
13see watch
i got... forcefully disconnected...
Shizuka how ablout leaving metal buckets of cold water everywhere?
Well that was odd.
damned storms
bam
all better hellp erry pony :P
13that's what procaster could do
Strange things happening @~@
13and this is a video
13guess i just have to give up ever streaming audiosurf until it's below zero here again...
Shizuka, where you live, its either summer for a month, or winter for the other 11 months :)
i said hellp i meant hello erry pony :P
13eeeeeeeeeyup
13don't know if i should keep streaming or just go to bed
is there sound on the stream?
13is now
Shizuka: time is? :o
okay making sure

poor junh

13oh nice this one has game of life built in
Well, this is random
bye, I'm mowing my Lawn now :)
this morning i did
http://myanimelist.net/anime/5958/Sora_no_Otoshimono
13yup... nopony saw my dancing with vis..
04Saw who dancing?
13note to future shizu... don't stream at 3:30..
04SHIZUKA WAS DANCING?
00,02this is a strange song
00,02Shizuka, :(
/me 00,02hugs Shizuka again
04What did I step into o_o
04And holy wow, only 79 people here tonight
did about an hour's+ work before i watched it though-
04...so quiet
00,02i'm in the mood for a new pony episode
13apparently ponychat breaking their client means we have no people
00,02but no new episodes right now :(
Its only 79 degrees outside.
the dub has a 5.1 soundtrack, but it has "problems", so i fixed them mostly before i watched it
04...wait, what's going on with Ponychat?
00,02oh, wondered why that wasnt loading
00,02Shizuka, would a backup hosted on broystate be woth the effort?
No Young Justice, Thundercats, Korra, or Ponies. Not much of a reason be awake right now.
00,02not realy much effort actualy
ep10 was a music-based episode so i had to take care to not damage the music too much on loud bits
04What happened while I was away?
people are using a different IRC or something?
13something broke with ponychat, the chat embed doesn't work
/me scratches head
00,02ponychat.net is down
oh
00,02the admins in #geek, i've pinged him
00,02probably working on it now

Ghosties!
Hi :3
04Herro

MC Frontalot - It Is Pitch Dark
Ghosties: How's it going? :3
lol
"I MENT EVRY WORD"
04Oh, not too bad. Glad to see that more people are alive
forward foward
hmm, now would be a good time to water the plants, but its also a good time go have bats in your face. What a dilemma
[1,0You0,4Tube]: EvaBebop (evangelion + cowboy bebop parody) | by | Length: | Views: 84.075
no
Ghosties: Yeah. I've just been doing other stuff.
when does the livestream of bronycon start?
I don't know how much longer I can stay awake with this music, hmm. Its so nice~
see http://www.aquilinestudios.org/evabebop.html
someone has too much time on their hands
Wait there's gonna be a live stream of bronycon? O_O
13ponies need wakeup music?
I wanna remake it in HD in AFX when i get the time...
oh nice... Elfen Lied music...

sumica dat tf2
the OP has a TVSIZE 5.1 version on the remastered DVDs
sumica is probably just practicing
the surround mix sounds acceptable/mediocre
OP?
but i think couldv'e been done better, like playing more instruments in the back speakers
OPening
I remember when this was the title screen song for Madden

shizu needs more fans
ALL the fans
13i just need a desk where asuka isn't holed up in a shelf
13where the heat has nowhere to go
Shizu needs a liquid cooling system
Shizuka named her PC Asuka?
13ofc
13i name all my boxen

fridge
13my server is haruko, my last desktop was kimiko, my laptop is takara

13no real pattern to where the names come from
Should try to name my lappy too :D
*then
bye mario_pony! take care!:)
i named my PC JC...
well, Shizuka, it would seem your server and your current desktop have something in common
mine is name Toshiba, true story
13http://i.imgur.com/7Yy6q.jpg obviously it's pitch dark atm but you get the idea how bad the ventilation is there
they are both named after badasses
13ikr
My PC is named corei5-pc
ORIGINALITY
I think I'm gonna leave too, gnight bronystate, take care :)
I didn't name it that, though >_>
13i'm not sure haruko is that badass though... only has 256MB ram in there, sits under my bed and barely does anything beyond IRC
my xbox origional was named Whisper
13i shouldn't have opened my imgur library... now i really want to fix my gmod cpu...
13http://i.imgur.com/30EGP.jpg
oh well, she is named after a badass anyway :3

13the server i did it on was way back in classic, was from bedrock to 128 ceiling
13i know they've lifted the height cap now but i haven't been able to get it right again
still havent gotten minecraft
Shizuka: that's sxc
13 http://imgur.com/a/0ZL2G#0 this is still my best work from classic
/me zooms back in on that pic of Shizu's setup to see what kind of soda she drinks
/me is pro stalker
13coke, pepsi, that was dr pepper that day i think
13not really committed to any brand :3
it isnt stalking if the pray knows about it
just creeping
i would play minecraft if i had the money to get it, or if i got it randomly... neither will probably happen :P
13oh look video http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA053EF37DDED5397
well Im a pro creeper too
Rain, don't you love the two ponies in front of Shizu's monitors?
I have those two :3
/me is drinking Dr. Pepper right now
the only ones I managed to get while they were still the toy at MCD

But I has no monies :<
Shizuka has a maze in her room
I really should hang my pinkie pie ornament on my rear view mirror
13not really my room
13more of a hallway
Midnight_Tempest: neither do I! But I have two PONY.MOV shirts :D
13my room... is a disaster... and i'm not picturing it >>
hahaha
cant be worse than my room
.mov... i dont like those vids at all...
it has about 10% walking space
13my room is up the stairs, that maze game in the background is something from a way way way long time ago that i brought back from illinois last time
13yeah i might have 10%...
MY ROOM IS NICE AND CLEAN! ^_^
oh mine is too, it just has a lot of stuff in it
my turn
We just need to repain it :S
memememememe
*repaint
Midnight_Tempest: the shirts are kinda nice though, and they're awesome to troll oblivious friends with :D
13the problem with minnesota is there's no good time to clean my room... it's either summer and horrifyingly hot and humid up there (no AC, no airflow) or freezing winter
-shrugs-
thats the joy of the great lakes for you
god, I know what you mean, Shizuka. Arkansas is uber humid and it has been in the 100s (F) for the past 2 weeks
It's hot and humid in here too, because I'm close to the sea
/me Needs to meet up with some of the ponies in this chat sometime -_-
http://youtu.be/Eiz0a4U0JIM
13yeah south is getting serious heat..
yay for a random thunderstorm...
its decent weather here... when it isnt raining all the damn time
13it almost broke 100 here this week... heat index was definitely up there but i think the max my thermometer caught was 98
13<3 rain~
WallDives: Lucky. Wisconsin really needs rain
so glad it isnt that hot up here
I must go! Wisconsin needs me!
Ponies47, so did Ohio. 104F was insane.
oh wait, Arkansas needs me too. Shit's dry, yo
i hate rain (not Rain) right now... makes it hard to walk outside for my exercise or get to work when the river is swollen...
13http://i.imgur.com/zvGuM.jpg i forget why i have this picture in there...

Oh right, sorry Rain :D
/me stares at MadSurge with sunken in eyes "I never sleep"
14so much hypocrity?
Sleep is for the weak
almost 3am here
and Canada, Mexico, etc.
Rain: I wish I could do that :D
Sleep comes once a week
MadSurge, I wish it were a choice
I would opt out
Otherwise, sleep for a whole day and be sleepless the rest of the week :D
Insomnia suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks
^
Hug anypony? :3
I got a bad case of it when I was on my finals week last semester in college
every 34 hours I just sleep for 10 hours and repeat.
and im back after a nightly update
Know that feel Rain
there was one day where I was going 100+ hours with no sleep and had 4 finals on that day aswell
everytime someone says hug, repressed feelings well up.
LEGASP, the flash chat is back up! Hold on *quits IRC*

alexxm: I haven't slept yet. Pulling an all nighter because I go on a roadtrip to Michigan later today and I won't be back and won't talk you guys until Monday. :(
Ponies47: solid effoer
effort*
04That chat was all wishy washy
well hope the road trip goes well then Ponies47 have fun in michigan
Ponies47: well , I hope you enjoy your roadtrip! :)
04Basically ponychat went down and the IRCops saved the day
Michigan is boring
thanks Ghosties
Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain your guys
Ghosties: very barren and essential chat, huh
Ghosties http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjQilnp-7Q have you heard of this guy before
another god damn ping from chocolate rain
not much
are you like, siblings with HML?
Scumbag Warner Brothers: Buy an app we made, YOU PAY FOR UPDATES!
should I change my name? yeah, probably. Will I? nope
04Yep, sure have alexxm. That's Kobashi
might be an idea to Rain
problem is that I dont want to change my nick
because my name /is/ Rain
he's work looks awesome from what i saw in the video Ghosties
04It's Japan, those wrestlers are awesome
Rain why not add a number or something then
IRC is older than I am D:
IRC was created in 1988
because numbers are lame
Scribblenauts Unlimited is going to be released on WINDOWS?! TAKE MY MONEY, DAMN YOU!
well, Viri, biribiri is also the sound of tearing paper sou ┐(￣ー￣)┌
ok Rain
Rain: no, your name is fine like this :)
Ghosties, I have a tough decision to make...
rain rain rain rain chocolate rain
I can go to a RAW taping, or a Impact taping.
04Eh
04Go to CHIKARA
WallDives: NOT TNA.
04I know I am :D
not a taping in Ohio.
or else I would.
04October 7th, baby. Burlington NC
04Can't wait
Good morning everypony :)
MadSurge, but BOBBY ROOOOOOOOOOO!
Hey ThunderCloud!
04BOBBY...................
04ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooo
WallDives: :D
14x3
04I love how nobody can pronounce his name
hello MadSurge! :)
ikr?
hey ThunderCloud hows your day been
hi ThunderCloud.
04Oh god, I wanna stream Botchamania
you should.
/me hugs alexxm
What's Botchamania? :P
do it Ghosties
04I would if I knew how
hi WallDives )
ack.
WallDives: thank god I watch Botchamania, otherwise I would have never gotten that joke :D
/me hugs RainBowJAck
04Botchamania are videos that showcase wrestling moments that are, well, fail
04Botches are when moves, promos, etc. can go wrong
and hello alexxm!
/me hugs RainBowJack
for example brock lesnar attempting to do a shoting star press
Or just plain stupidity from wrestlers on the ring
Or funny public reactions :D
or basically, all of CZW.
god they suck.
04Hey, Brock doing a shooting star press is a big deal
hai guys
04That guy is too damn huge, yet he could do it
I want to punch this idiot. https://twitter.com/MandaSwaggie
hi Chrysalis.
04Hello Chrysalis
ohai Chrysalis
Hey Chrysalis! :)
04Haha, CZW
hello Mistress Chrysalis
i know he can do it Ghosties but he messed up when he did it on kurt angle
hey Chrysalis hows your day been
WallDives: can they do anything BUT hardcore matches? JAAYYYYSUS!
04Everytime Maffew shows CZW clips he always shows Conan before
Spell-of-Gaming: isnt her crush on the guy punishment enough?
04And the JESUS clips get better and better
dat lever.
04More like dat smile XD
I have to stop the video every time.
...and flash storm is upon me.
how are people this fine evening
/morning / night / afternoon
i'm good Chrysalis how about you
04Not too bad, yourself?
Who be streaming? :3
00,02is that working?
I'm guessing Warner Bros. would release the game on Steam.
we see it Phase4
00,02i forgot a few things
Phase4: I got a stream :)
i'm pretty good, just dealin with more minecraft server issues which are becoming quite a pain
/me shakes his fist at flash.
04My favorite ending to any Botchamania was the Booker T/Cole "anal bleeding" line dubbed with Disney's Hercules
i has no stream
04Herc's face while he was reading Booker's "Wut............wow........." was absolute gold
Well it stopped now
buffering

Ghosties: YEP :D Dusty Rhodes is a funny guy :D
AppHangB1?
So wait, what's A1?
SAUCE?
Hmmm
i rember one time when he was commentating on a crusier weight match he said hit him in leggy weggy MadSurge
04Yes he is, though I much don't care to see the man wrestle
Ghosties: yeah me neither
I cant get any of this stuff... how he hell did you guys get ahold of it so fast, Phase4?
Hey I've played on that sever! There really good! :D
00,02Rain, sheer dumb luck
00,02and then i got backstabbed
blarg
*server
Ghosties: I mean, I could watch a match with friends, but otherwise don't care at all about wrestling
Phase4: Never stand still ya' foal! >:3
Good afternoon everypony
hey killerpony7733 hows your day been
For some reason, I get a lot of bad luck sometimes.
alexxm just woke up can't comment yet on that :D
hmmm. There's open spots I could join in :3
04Aw, man, that sucks :( Thankfully my best friend and another friend are really into wrestling so we have fun :D
And you know what's funny? My middle name is Brian. :o
00,02god dmaned lag
00,02stabbed by the time he bumps into me
...awkward silence...
i'd say the undertaker is what got me into wrestling
00,02new scout weapons are powerfull
/me snickers and points at Spell-of-Gaming "He said his middle name was Brian..."
so what does pyro see when he dies then
alexxm beats me :P
hmm
who killed the chat
04He sees the Undertaker
back. and MINUS 5 STARS.
alexxm: probably a bed where the chubby enemies lay him into :D
04And then the Undertaker gets set on fire by pyro as an act of revenge
^
04@WallDives: FAT ASSES!
Meh (squee) it. I'm gonna join in.
/cure Theme of Tara
I kinda hate my parents for naming me that... my siblings have WAY MORE interesting names. :I
Ghosties dont say that to Princess celestia
WallDives: WE COMIN' FO' YOU NIGGA!
04I wouldn't say it to Celestia, Scott Steiner would
SUPER DRAGON! Oh, shi--
04And you don't want Scott Steiner coming after your ass
04Like holy shit
^
04You do NOT want Scott Steiner after you
I'm WAY more afraid of Steiner than celestia.
Ghosties well he thinks everyones one of his freaks
like, COME ON, he cant be human.
04Steiner may have gotten that kind of physique thanks to roids, but he DEFINITELY can still whip some ass
^
04And his attitude is hair trigger
oh god. Russo. Warrior vs Steiner.
TNA.
hell i'm surprised he helped improve the hurricanna
the end of the universe.
WallDives: TNA is fail :(
04Protip: NEVER call a frankensteiner a 'hurricanrana.' Just don't do it bro
ok Ghosties
MadSurge, they're seriously getting better.
04In fact, for your own safety, never even bring up the word 'hurricanrana' around Scott Steiner
more entertaining than Lauper and Slater.
how come Ghosties
WallDives: did they fire Trixie?
04Because Steiner is a fucking psychopath
04I'm not joking, I'm not kidding
04Steiner is batshit crazy
Ghosties:
...
i heard he once got into a fight back stage with diamond dallas page
I thought for a moment you were talking about Final Fantasy IX, then I read up. Slightly disappointed now Ghosties. :P
Ghosties: His wrestler persona or irl?
04IRL
04Like
Adelbert Stiener is fine too.
04Steiner is EXACTLY like his character IRL
/me tacklehugs WallDives.
Oh dear D:
Didn't know if anyone'd get that. :)
Ghosties i heard he once got into a fight back stage with diamond dallas page
Lasharus, yep, played almost every FF.
Same here. The last few with disappointment, but I played 'em. :P
And Adelbert "Rusty" Steiner is genius. :P
04And yeah, DDP was the only one to fight back against Steiner back stage and Steiner beat his ass :(
He sounds like a nice man, Ghosties.
04Which is sad, because DDP is my favorite WCW wrestler ever
04Also, Lasharus, I don't care much for FFIX ^_^
Im a
D'awww.
04So I wouldn't know there is a Steiner in that game
I still think that one's underappreciated, but I won't tell you you're wrong. It's all opinion, after all.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_vs._Antonio_Inoki oh yeah Ghosties i found out about that yesterday
I mean, there are people that like Final Fantasy XIII, and I'll never understand them either. But hey, if they're having fun, more power to them.
chat has entered awkward silence mode
But yeah, the Scott Steiner you've described so far sounds like an eminently freaky person, Ghosties.
Damnit alexxm, I was typing, gimme a chance here. :P
04Huh, I didn't know Inoki went up against Ali
04Interesting
04Very true, Lasharus
04I prefer X and VIII myself
DDP was pretty cool.
I like X, after getting past an hour or so of gametime (the start isn't that great), but I don't much like VIII.
It tried some new things, but the story was poor. To me. My opinion, no flaming please.
:P
04Is Phase streaming?
i think so Ghosties
Ghosties: He sure is!
the chat just EXPLODED.
I like VI, but I was always a Phantasy Star guy.
04Ah
I've no idea. I'm not sure which of the mods habitually stream TF2.
more then likely phase
i think most of them do
so awakward silence time again
Final Fantasy VI is also very good, but for some reason, I never managed to finish it.
And I think I'll wrap up this conversation now, because frankly, it seems that discussing it at the moment is killing the chat. :P
nah XAX is streaming
oh wait im capped
its a slow chat, Lasharus.
/me takes the walk of shame back to his offline minecraftr
That too WallDives. :P
Lasharus: most of em...
04Lasharus, sent you a PM
But I know I can be a mildly obsessive fanboy, so if we get this discussion truly going, it won't end. :P
Ghosties: I read it, and replied twice. :P
great song for this
first andrew wk i actually heard
song
i just killed the chat didn't i
Emingently possible alexxm.
But I just went back to reading a fanfic, so I'm not exactly contributing either. :P
chat is in a constant state of ded
well there are less then 100 on today
The world will end and all that.
Lasharus you should see scoot when he starts talking about gaming in general
probably
poor chat
you murderer!
...Chrysalis, did you lag out, by any chance?
it was so young
alexxm LIES
dat net splir.
there are always 100
split*
I get the impression you just replied to four random quotes in the chat. :P
Seven now, in fact.
Oh, so that's what happens with a netsplit, XAX?
I'd never really experienced it myself.
Annnnd my tendency towards rambling shoots me in the foot once more.
what are the purposes of net splits anyways
nah, just in the middle of talking to server hosts atm
some issues with restoring a server
Lasharus yea, netsplits are just a node disconnecting, theyll be back soon enough
wow, dad is playin the wubs today
no idea what, but hes downstairs and my entire room is shaking
>dad
>dubstep
what a legend
To quote a friend of mine:
delayed kick seems delayed
yeah.
ohai splitters
"I used to listen to dubstep back in the 80's. Every time I connected to the internet."
who got kicked
alexxm i did
LOL AND THEN EVERYONE THAT GOT SPITTED JOINED AGAIN
Ok now my chat is working :)
right, i got to go do the dishes
Do enjoy.
i pray my ears survive the trip through wubland
Chrysalis i suggest headphones

00,02MusicalPony, you did nothing wrong
04No, MusicalPony, you didn't do anything wrong...how old are you?
00,02Ghosties, is being Ghosties
MusicalPony, meet our mods. They bark a bit but they're nice people :D
MadSurge: if you could relate to bbbff song, maybe you will cry like me when watching Warrior (2011) movie
why does That matter?
04Because, to be honest, bronies in our community that are younger tend to not have as much a sense of humor
valoreins: the old wrestler movie?
Italian opening, cathiest thing ever
MusicalPony: You may be amazed. I know my age makes some... comment. And hello, everypony.
im 15./
00,02ohai Kencolt
:|
hey Kencolt hows your day been
04Ah, well, I didn't mean anything by it MusicalPony
04As Phase said, it's just me being me
hi:D
Fair to middling. Fair to middling...
alright good. :3
MadSurge: more like MMA/UFC spprot thing, but its tearjerking for men with siblings
04I'm not the love and tolerate one
sport*
Nerom: I'm italian and I'm amused at the reaction of the bronies to this theme :D
MusicalPony: Welcome to the community. *Hugs o pony love*
haha alright then ghosties
Ghosties y u Reject mes
oh thanks fairy :]
04I'm a Gilda, if I were to associate myself with any one character from the show
haha OHH.
Ghosties is the outrageous one :o
As the Elder, I welcome you, MusicalPony . UNless there's finally someone beating me out for tat title? :)
04Oh god, it's Kencolt
Well FairysHuff I just love this song :P I know some italian but it makes no sence to me anyway :D
Does pinkie pie have ADHD?
Hehe thank you all for welcoming me :]
04The oldest dude on our chat
MusicalPony: Anytime. You'll find I'm the overly affectionate one. ^_^ When I'm not it pain that is
haha Fairy :]
04Mr. Colt, if I may ask, how old are you?
So Ghosties you act cool and tought?
YES, this song :3
04@RainBowJack: No, I just don't give a shit about smiling, loving, and being tolerant
brb
FairysHuff: Remind me to keep our new young foal away from a certain someone :D
so ghosties is no show pony
dat Kencolt is 54... which makes him awesome
Ghosties: 54 at the moment. 55 in November unless the maya were correct and then we're all dead, or something.
MusicalPony: Little tip in using the chat. If you type in part of someones name and then press TAB you'll auto enter their name.
so like FairysHuff ?
04This, however, does not make me a douchebag. I just don't particularly care for all the loving and the tolerating you kids are into
did it XD
Kencolt: o_o
you are awesome.
MusicalPony: Yes exactly
04And awesome, Mr. Colt
so wait, how do you do that fairy?
Ghosties likes dissapointing me. Fantastic
Kencolt thats awesome
MusicalPony: You just did it ^_^ trust me.
Master of the house keeper of the...
04Yes, I love making JRP feel bad
so it makes the ding sound when i do that?
JRP needs more attention guys
XAX: My age does not make me awesome. That fact that I've survived this long with a damaged nervous system, an artificial hip and can still laugh about that makes me awesome.
help him
04It is the absolute highlight of my day
im half the age of Kencolt... and his birthday is in November...
MusicalPony: Type about half or enough to let it find it and press TAB it will auto find the whole name
Kencolt: are you me from the future?
MusicalPony: Of someones username that is
MusicalPony: If I were to type is mus and then press tab your name would auto enter the chat.
00,02lets try doomsday
04Mr. Colt, I just think it's awesome that you're on here and you're that age
killerpony7733: so it makes the thing ding when i click tap?
MusicalPony: if you type the name correctly, yes it does
Ghosties does pinkie pie have ADHD?
04Most likely
Midnight_Tempest: HAH1 For all intents and purposes, around you guys, I'm from the PAST!
haha this chat is very interesting.
i especially love the music.
KenColt: you like the Show?
MusicalPony: For the users name you put in correctly yes, But did you type a bit of the name and press TAB and it found my name?
00,02MusicalPony, where do you live btw?
MusicalPony: wait until there's more people around :D
00,02awww

00,02music was coming from the other server :(
Phase4: Colorado. you?
MusicalPony: Ok remember that it makes pinging someone or responding alot easier

RainBowJack: No, I like to chat pointlessy with random-- OF COURSE I LIKE TYHE SHOW.
00,02near melbourne
MadSurge: haha whats that mean?
thanks killerpony7733
Kencolt: hehe why els would you be here for :P
MusicalPony: He means it's a very slow day and on movie nights this chat becomes spam central
MusicalPony: if mistyped the name won't do a ping, that's all :P

MadSurge: makes sense.
MusicalPony: Euro movie night in 7 hours btw.
Ghosties: Who you talking about unusual me? Why I never nah I'm a very silly filly :P
FairysHuff: and im going tomiss it?!
MusicalPony: I don't know. Are you? It starts in 7 hours.
MusicalPony: During the episode streams the chat is even more insane and quick paced
RainBowJack: Well, there's educating the young-- but well... what I can educate about tends to be... eclectic.
FairysHuff: is 7 hours itll be 1pm here

MadSurge: thats crazy!
MusicalPony: Then yes you probably will miss it if you sleep.

MusicalPony: So you're european too?

00,02yeah, i has new items

Can someone link MusicalPony the meet the pyro vid?
please do..
Fun fact: Zelda oot is best game ever
That should explain it
Everybody stutters one way or the other, so check out my message to you: As a matter of fact, don't let nothin' hold you back. If the Scatman can do it, then so can you.
im new to all of this XD
MusicalPony: That reminds me read the FAQ and rules here?
That loks like a very... impractical weapon. Or tuba. Or whatever it is.
nice, my TF2 crashed
yeah i did killerpony7733
I came here when I was in the denial stage
And I farted
MusicalPony: Ah ok atleast you have some brain unlike some that just jump in here and decide to do whatever
Kencolt: not much more impractical than the normal Pyro gun
:D
killerpony7733: You mean like you? ^_~
The only game I play is WoW. Yes, I play that. I like it.
Kencolt it's how the pyro sees his weapons in the meet the pyro video
woops sorry bout that
MusicalPony: Sorry for what?
Kencolt: to each is own.
i lagged out?
FairysHuff: Harr harr harr funny, :| But i know the limits so hehe :)
Im going to zip my pants up!
MusicalPony: Ah we can't tell ^_^
be right back.. :D
Actually, I'm a bit odd on my choices in Wow... I find myself playing Worgen only-- and invariably female-- but not QUITE for the usual reasons.
MusicalPony: anyway, here's the official welcome: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2637/ :D
/me Yawns
04<[iPad]JRP2234> Ghosties can I has stream <-- I know you probably know the answer by now, but no

08,01and BUCK is doing a panel!
08,01abotu bronies!
thanks for the cider, MadSurge

MadSurge: Fun fact i got 2 cans of cider in my fridge you jelly? ;)
Ghosties what ur saying is I not allowed to watch stream at all
08,01i certainly will
04No, what I'm saying is that you can not has stream to stream
04You can watch stream
Heh, that'd be the day.
04Make us all proud

killerpony7733: not really, I don't drink :D
"The stream's online, but YOU can't watch."
MusicalPony: I'm front
MadSurge: You must be jelly! darnit :D
FairysHuff: say what?
Ghosties I'm going to zip my pants up
I liked Pyro even before the upgrades :D
.............wot.
MusicalPony: Small joke involving word play ^_^ Thats all
04@JRP: ok
It;s very simple about streaming. You must be this tall to stream. Since all the mods are three meteres tall, well..
:( i feel so newbish
Ghosties why am I so silly
FairysHuff: You silly filly don't mess with the young foals mind :D
MusicalPony: We all did
The ADHD might be why
killerpony7733: I wasn't. I genuinely thought she would get it ^_^
04You may want to get some help for that, JRP
:'(
FairysHuff: She? dafuq :O
ima SHE
Nevers
killerpony7733: You don't pay much attention do you...
MusicalPony: And yes. You ARE watching a game of Team Fortess 2 with various ponies on the walls, corners, and-- at times-- used as weapons.
MusicalPony: are you male or female anyway? :D
Kencolt: thats awesome
female MadSurge
04<MusicalPony> ima SHE
04She just said it
FairysHuff: Considering i hav woken up less then 2 hours ago yes
O.O
thanks Ghosties
04No prob
killerpony7733: I woke half an hour ago
that looks like the most wonderful game of team fortress
Actually-- one of my WoW character has a pony. Next Brewfest, getting one for my main if I can.
MusicalPony: wait until the female mods come in :D
yay! hehe.
FairysHuff have you taken some asprian for that
i hope thats soon MadSurge
alexxm: I took painkillers yesterday but they did nothing. So I'm just riding the pain out.
00,02theres bugger all for an engi to do on this map
04Well, if Luna decides to come on then she'll be here soon
00,02i think this is helping
MusicalPony: so, did you pick a favorite pony yet? :D
00,02heavys are certinly getting here fast
OH OF COURSE I DID MadSurge !!!! Applejack for sure!
FairysHuff: I tend to do that all the time unless I ache a lot. and then an Advil does well enough for me. I take it you have a different problem?
08,01Kencolt: what age factor?
i also have tf2. what server is it?
04<MusicalPony> OH OF COURSE I DID MadSurge !!!! Applejack for sure! <-- Hell yeah, another AJ fan
00,02glennglog22, some random server
MusicalPony: Good choice! She's on my top tier too!
00,02its the new gamemode
:D Applejack is my hero
/me loves Aj
oh
i have pyrovision
i assume that was good
MusicalPony: Good pony ^_^ I feel applejack doesn't get enough attention. Nice to see more people having her as a favourite
and why do our chars have high voicds?
hehe i liked her from the start. reminds me of myself sometimes FairysHuff
What-- is that a card? Is he going to play YuGiOh at them?
I love all of the mane six and beyond equally cause all has a thing you can relate to :)
http://derpy.me/VFfhm
so true killerpony7733
FairysHuff: Ah. In my case, it's my feet-- neural damage. ALWAYS half-ache half =sting.
MusicalPony: I'm more FLuttershy so she's my fave.
weird how I still had that on paste
FairysHuff: understandable. shes one of my faves too.
MusicalPony: If i had to be picky i would be a mix of rainbow dash and fluttershy and rarity
Tovler: That card SCARES me.
Kencolt: I would kill to have pain that ISN't in my skull ^_^
i'd like to join the server :D
12I doubt anyone's awake right now...
00,02idiot spy
Kencolt clap REALLY hard
14o.o
haha i dont really like rarity all too much
MusicalPony: My favs are Pinkie, Fluttershy and AJ
Chrysalis: Why?
I can't wait to kill some Blue Eyeseses with that card.
MadSurge: thats awesome :]
cause then youd get a pain in your hands, not your skull
MusicalPony: Again only if i wanted to be picky,
:P
:)
MusicalPony: Did someone link you the "meet the pyro" video btw?
hey +phase4. can i add you on steam?
Chrysalis: No, no, MY pain is in my feet. it's FairysHuff who has the headaches, and anyhow, at the moment, my feet are behaving.
00,02glennglog22, yup
00,02steam name is Phase4
FairysHuff: nope..
12oh good, at least you're up ^^
ded

12D8
12ow!
12Whyyyyyy ;-;
MusicalPony: ~_(\ *Face hoof* I'll do it then. Hang on.
haha alright.
04Because I can
So many balloons. Did Pinkie Pie explode? At least once?
I would hope so
Drake you should play DFO with me ):
04whyyyyyy
cus' I want someone to play with
04I really don't enjoy that game
Kencolt according to meet the pyro this is how the pyro sees the game
well
Kencolt: she's secretly the Pyro :D
why don't you like it?
I mean
it obviously won't suit everyone
but why?
04I find it tedious and boring.
how so?
04And I don't entirely understand everything.
alexxm: I'm fairly certin the baloons are not normal...
/me shrugs
I didn't initially either
and I still don't
04Plus, I have no interest getting involved in another MMO that will eat up my time.
):
04Plus ME3 and Skyrim still devour my time with relish, plus I have this book I'm actually writing now
04wait goddamnit WHEN DID I START RATIONING MY TIME
04oh
04right
12I like Minecraft best when it's multiplayer
02Diablo III

Great, the plaza is really nice.
/me growls at alexxm
And I've made friends with several bronies already
MusicalPony: Glad you enjoyed it ^_^ And hope it explains whats going on in the stream now.
sometimes the rocket bugs out though
/me pets Honeybadger
OK. That explains his viewpoint. it does not explain why the bucking ENGINEER is seeing the baloons.
FairysHuff: definitely does.
MusicalPony: Groovy cakes.
:]
Engineer has Pyrovision Goggles
*Snuggles up to entire chat for love and sympathy* ~_~
aww
/me hugs FairysHuff

Ponies47: Now, I don't have to go all parental on you, do I? :)
/me hugs you all.
/me is hugged :)
GilDash: Hey Gildy :)
GilDash: But. I'm going on a road triip later today and I won't be able to talk to you guys until Monday :(
now how do you do that? italics?
Ponies47: Tsk, don't you worry about us. You have fun now. :)
MusicalPony: No idea. I haven't bothered to learn ^_^
-.-
MusicalPony: Type in "/me" followed by a space and whatever you want to say. :)
/me like this
/me likes apples
MusicalPony: It's called an emote. Te format is "/me (text)" without the () part.
haha awesome
GilDash: Michigan is boring plus roadtrips make me sleepy -_-
/me throws bacon all over the room
Ponies47: Hey, I can't be the passenger in a car for more then half an hour without falling asleep. :D
00,02dis is not working so well
road trips make me cry
Phase4, build it somewhere where it wont get shot and then move it
00,02Rain, i was stuck there
I LOVE YOU
speaking of road trips.. im going on a road trip sunday morning
put it to the side so it wont get shot while it is being built
i think pinkie pie has adhd
MusicalPony: Oh? Where you going?
Well, I'm away for a bit-- i have a few dailies to do. I think I'll probably be back by the Eurocast.
/me waves.
Chicago :(
/me hugs Kencolt.
GilDash: I have to spend about 6 hours in the same (squee) car with 6 other (squee) poeple -_-
FairysHuff: its gonna suck.
00,02dis is still not working
well I will go to a different server, that server keeps on crashing my TF2
00,02Rain, problem is theres nowhere on this map where a sentry is safe
Ponies47: Why are you on a road trip anyway? Going anywhere nice, and with anyone you know?
00,02there is ALLWAYS an obvious and crowded area outside its range
lol
00,02and you cant build near spawn cause of how far away the nearest area is
00,02ooo, badwater
Sod it. I can't take it anymore. The pain is too much. I have to take painkillers. I just hope they actually work this time. ~_~
08,01so we're going to be doing a pony rap in the openign ceremony
GilDash: Same one from yesterday
08,01i suggested it as a joke
08,01but then Ruth made me write one
FairysHuff: You poor thing... :(
08,01so: http://pastebin.com/q7hxyQ8V
/me hugs FairysHuff.
Phase4 can I donate under your name
/me feels sad
GilDash: *cuddles into you*
08,01awesome!
00,02[iPad]JRP2234, i'd rater not actualy
GilDash: Lucky you :D wish i could go
GilDash: I'd like to go but I'd probably be panicky with all the people about
Phase4 why u no watch footy(afl)
GilDash: I live in Wisconsin. The road trip is to Michigan it is for my step brother and my step sisters who I hate so much but atleast they only come out to live with us for a month. And I don't know anybody in Michigan. So it's just really for the step brother and sisters because they lived in Michigan and then moved out to Washington (state) with there mom.
00,02[iPad]JRP2234, it bores me
BULL SHIT PHASE4
FairysHuff: Hey, I won't have a bucking clue who's there, but I've decided it doesn't matter at all. :)
Anyone here use Last FM? :)
GilDash: As i said i'm saving money up all this year when i begin to get money from the state
i feel so sad... i just met you all and yet in a few days i wont hear from anypony again..
GilDash: Oh not that. I just don't like crowds and loud noise. Makes me nervous
Ponies47: Ugh, I know that feel. Fortunately it was only a four hour trip from here to Yorkshire, but still... =_=
MusicalPony: What why? :(
MusicalPony: We'll be right here when you come back. :)
00,02goddamned spys
FairysHuff: I'm sure you'd be fine if you went with someone you knew. :)
GilDash: Think how I feal. I'm gonna be so bored -_-
I'm discussing dark pony fanfiction with a girl on facebook at quater to twelve at night.
Ponies47: cause im leaving sunday and i dont have a computer where im going.. and i may not ever be back again because im not allowed on computers at my real home...
wait what
Ponies47: Yes, I know quite how you'd feel. When I went up there was *nothing* to do at all. :(
MusicalPony: Your real home??
MusicalPony: :<
FairysHuff: i live with my mom in Colorado originally, but im with my dad. and my mom doesnt allow me on the computer unless its for homework.
XAX: What's the problem?:D
GilDash: I have been to Michigan before nothing to do really.

GilDash: eeeyup
MusicalPony: Aaah. I see. Well I don't know if it's possible but could you not use a computer for free at your local library?
XAX: Who the hay knows? Just enjoy it. :)

/me Hugs GilDash back

MusicalPony: Surely she wouldn't stop you going to the library?
Tf2 froze again
MusicalPony: Now, why would you be grounded? Has someone been a naughty pony? ;)
she doesnt let me go anywhere cause she thinks ill sneak out to do things with my boyfriend.
MusicalPony: That's just silly. :(
and yes GilDash i've been an irresponsible pony
MusicalPony: Well, there *is* a valid reason then. :S
yeah its valid GilDash but its depressing cause i wont see you ponyfolk again :(
/me delay hugs Ethereal.
MusicalPony: It won't last forever. We'll be here when you get back. :)
MusicalPony: Well be it a year or 5, we'll still be here.
but you'll grow on, and do better things, wont you? :
MusicalPony: Yet we'll still come back here. :)
MusicalPony: LOL! Not likely ^_^
12BACON
FairysHuff: GilDash well if you're still here by the time im allowed again, that would make me real happy :] you make me feel welcome in the herd
MusicalPony: I certainly will be. :)

my mom
AgentKalim: They went back to that exact room.
Maybe they changed the locking mechanism.

robotdragon Goddammit, i just said FUCK from the bottom of my heart and i've said every insult that there is.......There's nothing left, so i guess somepony should invent a new curse word

morning null
12:24
so what now
now
:O
*dances and shoots party cannon*
let's speculate what will happen on season 3
Question: Is Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children an A or B movie?
:p
A
Cranberry_Scotch a
A i think
Let's get down to business to defeat the Huns!
:o
Okay
:[
Cranberry_Scotch: If Spirits Within could make for an A film, so can Advent Children.
Pinkie will get fat and learn about diet and exercise.
:'(
Wat
:D
putting B on an expensive animation movie seems unfair, even if it's so-so
:D
that sounds pretty legit actually
im hoping for a new villan at the end of all of it.
Tover what
John de Lancie returns as a VA in season 3... but is it really Discord again?
when's the next movie
http://derpy.me/VFfhm and this thing will make her fat.
:)
valoreins: One can only hope.
valoreins who else would he voice
Q maybe
i think we should go for 5 seasons with 4 villans, then at the end one really big and bad villan controls them all and then epic climax.
well the past shows that have had this done have gone up to 6 seasons
yep
Q in an MLP universe... that goes on crossover fanfic
and great resolution
5 seasons
and let's hope the next generation of MLP learns from G4
true dat.
ya
Lauren Faust already hinted at that.
After watching The Secret of Kells, I really want an MLP movie.
yucca
nick/ Twily
wat
hey guys
after watching the 22 min version of Cupcakes, i'm afraid to watch a movie...
hi

I can't spell

Too bad the idea wouldn't sell

:D
Cupcakes would make a good horror film
ikr
.^ agree
What?

Mixing MLP with that new Ted movie would be… sellable to Hollywood at least.
Cranberry_Scotch just put hostel and swenny todd togethor
Maybe
/me admin slayed Twily
random
words

Dr. Psych Ology SpeaksDoctors Edwards and Redden will present new findings from their ongoing BronyStudy survey, which now includes close to 20,000 bronies and non-bronies. They will discuss a revised Brony Typology (there are now five types of bronies), review the various motivations for being a brony, and discuss the moral nature and implication (WWPD) of the brony community.
i believe so just go to equatria dailu for details
/me sneaks up to kirzstryfe from behind and nomz him
I'm back! Hi kirzstryfe!
(uses portal gun to get kirzstrfye out of ninjazz)
Iron_Edge: I see. Not to seem ungrateful or anything of the sort, but weren't you going to embarrass me earlier? :S
Vordox: five types of bronies?
valoreins: Indeed
what are they?
Ninjazz|Frostmane: Waas being the operative word. Ya' see ninjazz ol' iron is what you call a "Lazy Pony" -lol :D I change my mind a lot.

RAWRity: Whooooo, thats a huge turnout
LOVE AND TOLERATION EVERYWHERE
Hey AttackWithHugs :)
AttackWithHugs: and that's just because they had a LIMIT of 4000 seats.
Hey MadSurge
ALRIGHT I'M READY
i try not to be jealous for unable to go to bronycon
RAWRity: Then how many thousands will be standing outside
I'll be reading Past Sins and recorded my opinion after each chapter
LET'S DO THIS
but hey, at least my friend is going there to find some gift for me :D
AttackWithHugs: I would hope there wouldn't be a bunch just waiting outside.
Is Bronystate streaming? using popout chat box
It's kind of streaming.
RAWRity: There could be at this very moment. BronyCon is serious business, even though it's an unoficial convention
k thx
http://www.everfreeradio.com/bronycon/
dat kyube http://twitpic.com/a2aj1k
RAWRity: IMO, I think BronyCon should be the "official
Who's streaming today?
RAWRity: Want a contract?
AttackWithHugs: eh, considering It's more about the fans than the show, and covers at lot of fan-made material, I don't think it would fit the idea of an official con.
How on earth seth post that while being in the con?
MadSurge: fuck no
Cranberry_Scotch: i don't think there will be much of a stream this weekend
Hm
Metronome, it's automatic
Cranberry_Scotch: at least not here
RAWRity: Yeah....
