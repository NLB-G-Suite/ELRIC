For some reason, it's kinda UTAU-sounding.

03but ew, Music Choice has a really ugly watermark now
But it definately does not sound like Teto.

I only know Miku
that's the extent of my vocaloid knowledge
Sooo just finished this one :p http://i48.tinypic.com/1zvpyxs.png

/me pokes
there is only one vocaloid and that is sharon apple
Oh mai
sharon apple you heard me right
Uh, isn't Sharon Apple a Vocaloid 3?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7auKvJ_k5k
Uh, that's a different company...
Crypton owns Vocaloid, if I'm not mistaken.
sharon apple is an AI singer in Macross Plus, an anime ova made in 1994 way before vocaloid ever came out
you take things too literally

00,02its kinda fiddly, vhscr gives very little direct feedback

11,02Hai :3
XD
y'all scare me sometimes
i scare myself often
.-.
{*~SuperBrony64~*}
00,02i think the encoder drops frames
lolololol
:3
O~O
Please tell me :/
PLEASE
11,02^-^
ahhhhhhh
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaa aaa aaaa aaaa
lol xD
I've been humming this in my head for ages

boom boom boom
00,02replaces every 'word' character [a-zA-Z0-9] with a
11,02Eating babies is just gross...and its literal meaning isn't the same as its actual meaning :)
11,02WHAT IF BABIES WERE MADE OF PEOPLE
HUH?
:O
Woah.
yeah, go on, eat the little brown babies first. xD
TT_TT
00,02fun fact: you can cheat the scoreboard, i'm not sure how much of a problem it is or how they combat it
mmmmm baked potatoes
00,02Shizuka, whats the bitrate?
13300
lol
13going to drop to 250 now
mmm.... baked!
00,02i dont think thats the problem
00,02how i wish there were open source replacments for the crap you need to stream
i've had sour cream go bad
lol
00,02cher3ry, i suspect its cause no one can figure the screencap bit
00,02you can just use WM_PRINT iirc, but thats epic slow
13give me some time..
00,02SuperBrony64, ....why
11,02FUN
he's got a poin
00,02cher3ry, its not that simple
*point
well yeah, compression..
Good night all
00,02cher3ry, i meen in theory all you need to do is read from the framebuffer, but the crap gpu makers have made over the years
00,10with out the encoder it's like masive deinterlacing
00,02there we go
00,02that works
00,02allmost, i'm inclined to blame the encoder
00,10now if only we all had lunas conection
00,10If we had that we could set keyframe to realtime
00,02Shizuka, decrease the keyframe interval, it'll look worse but should be smoother
or is it 2 mins because you got to beam it back?
00,02i'm adimant its the encoder
00,10Cant say for sure till I got a look at shizus settings
/me bursts into flames

Oh right, sorry Rain :D
14so much hypocrity?
it is, however, very early in America.
Sleep is for the weak
Rain: I wish I could do that :D
Sleep comes once a week
I would opt out
Otherwise, sleep for a whole day and be sleepless the rest of the week :D
Insomnia suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks
^
I got a bad case of it when I was on my finals week last semester in college
every 34 hours I just sleep for 10 hours and repeat.
Know that feel Rain
there was one day where I was going 100+ hours with no sleep and had 4 finals on that day aswell
everytime someone says hug, repressed feelings well up.

04I would if I knew how
ack.
04Botchamania are videos that showcase wrestling moments that are, well, fail
04Botches are when moves, promos, etc. can go wrong
for example brock lesnar attempting to do a shoting star press
or basically, all of CZW.
hai guys
I want to punch this idiot. https://twitter.com/MandaSwaggie
04Haha, CZW
Saturn: you there?

/cure Theme of Tara
I kinda hate my parents for naming me that... my siblings have WAY MORE interesting names. :I

I'm WAY more afraid of Steiner than celestia.
^
04And his attitude is hair trigger
TNA.
the end of the universe.
04Because Steiner is a fucking psychopath
04I'm not joking, I'm not kidding
04Steiner is batshit crazy
...
04IRL
04Like
Adelbert Stiener is fine too.
04Steiner is EXACTLY like his character IRL
Oh dear D:
Didn't know if anyone'd get that. :)
04Maybe he's not as loud, necessarily, but he's just as pompous, arrogant, and ill tempered as he is on camera
Same here. The last few with disappointment, but I played 'em. :P
And Adelbert "Rusty" Steiner is genius. :P
04Which is sad, because DDP is my favorite WCW wrestler ever
D'awww.
I still think that one's underappreciated, but I won't tell you you're wrong. It's all opinion, after all.
04Huh, I didn't know Inoki went up against Ali
04Interesting
DDP was pretty cool.
:P
04Ah
I've no idea. I'm not sure which of the mods habitually stream TF2.
i think most of them do
