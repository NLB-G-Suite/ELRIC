just remember

yeah, if you havnt changed it then leave it as it
as is*
She doesn't think she's pretty :(. I think she's beautiful :)
I messed with the built in overclocking settings
It was all autpomatic
und apparently she thinks I'm awesome :)
If it's holding at 60 with 100% load on 6 cores, surely i could go one step higher...
should be fairly good then, with temps of 60 you should be fine
But it's not worth it
hmmmm
well
Couple months old
having to constantly go back to recharge seems tedious tbh

Is there something on right now? I've got a player in my window but every time I press play it does nothing.
because nintendos were never really good at online.
05,15nothing's on at the moment

K, I thought my computer was screwing up
soooo.... good idea
bad idea
mini tourney?
over wifi?
bad idea
mine's 5
It would be unfair
because I would win
LOL
05,15Am I the only one that DOESN'T want the next gen of consoles to come out?
and that ruins the fun
(and if i can get a job)
wii u graphics look awesome (considering its a wii)
ORRR we can play 3vs 1
naw
Hey guys. been a while.
I would know if there was someone
http://derpy.me/Rldzh
you know why?
05,15Chaospony the name seems familiar
my attempt to work failed some more
I wish
because I would know if they were on smashboards
lol
and that determines alot
it gives me a warning when I go to it.
Not surprised :T
05,15Because, 1) money 2) I really don't see the need
i hope the next gen brings less CoD *shudders*
i tis
it is'
2 of the 3 consoles are glorified, underpowed, proprietary computers
My friendcode is 2022-0779-7103
nods nods
the other one is the same, but has exclusives worth investing in
XD
I think graphics have gone as far as they can. You know those live action games that just feel wrong?
05,15FMV games...PHANTASMAGORIA
maybe...
but then again i would still know
there are alot of really good lighting/shadowing techniques which there simply isnt enough power to do in real time
i mean I once requested Wombo Combo on the stream
maybe they're offline :O
More 3D games would be cool, once 3D TVs become cheaper
05,15at least not in the beginning
/me returns to #opers, seeing that his work has been done
lol, 3d is a terrible idea
ruins gameplay
plus out of ALL the people that could be on here that are on smashboards,
I got it on my graphics card where it can force most games to run in 3d
*beat
and i universally leave it off
and the chances of that are slim
its great for films etc, the depth can add alot to a movie
Lol
05,15I still feel that 3d is a gimick
it is
BRONYSTAE
oh my.... i did not think this through
yep XD
it's always been a gimmick
Ok I think I'm going to stop lurking...
05,15I saw Avatar, in 3d and in normal. Yeah I saw the difference, but it's not worth the extra money
05,15plus, anything 3d gives me a headache
Melee would make my chances even more probable
yeah same here
which tech did you use?
since, well I kinda got 33rd at Apex 2012 XD
3D movies are nice, it really makes the movie awesome for me
