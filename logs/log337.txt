8,1but frak it, i have 8 gigs installed
what settings on BF3
05when not streaming
Highest if I'm sniping, medium if I'm running around like a moron.
i only tend to play with everything either maxed, or overriden to be higher
05recource consukmption isnt ap roblem for me, so im ok with firefox in that regard
Chrome i think uses up more memory, but i think thats worth the speed.
Usually i have 3 programs open, fraps, skype, and chrome
heh, you wouldnt want to see my taskbar then if thats all you run :P
I always have tons of stuff on my taskbar.
>open something
>never close it
Sometimes tweetdeck if i'm watching a movie
:D
My entire taskbar now consist of steam, itunes, chrome, tweetdeck, fraps, and skype
@prince, a curse of the quad-core 8gb era, nothing ever closes
ever
All of which are open
0,14I've found Firefox plays nicer with this netbook as of late
I've got my 6 core
ooh nice
which chip?
I'm going to up my ram soon
0,14you people and your fancy-schmancy multi-core
Lemme check the specifics real quick
0,14;n;
amds never have enough low level cache for my taste
Would you like a link? keep in mind, I'm building this with very little money
just get me the model number, i can find everything else fromt erhe
X6 1100T
ooh the blacks are nice
clocked it or running stock?
Yeah, that's probably the most expensive part of my computer
Stock right now, but it doesn't need to clock.
why pay the extra for the black edition then?
I plan on clocking it, just hjaven't gotten around to it, you know how it is.
fair enoguh
enough*
that chip looks like itll hit 4-5 easy enough with a nice sink on it
I don't have liquid cooled or anything, but i've heard the fan installed can handle it.
liquid cooling is EXPENSIVE
NO kidding
the liquid kits cost more than any peice of my machine
I'll proably overclock it soon, i bought is specifically so it wouldn't go out of date in a year
so many adverts today...
Yay adblock
lol, not played that since cata launched
Also i'm too stupid to know how to overclock safely
its easy enoguh, jjust time consuming
Any specific program you reccomend?

How many restarts will it take? all of them.
Is the stream frozen for anybody else?

Asterix

blasphemy!

Don't get it, know Asterix and Obelix though.
the reason why i know asterix is completely unrelated to the show though
at least, Asterix the cartoon show anyways

buh bye PON3
I managed to get it up too 3.8
is it stable?
At 40 degrees celcius
hmm
lots of lava o crapt!
40 is gonna be idle, whats its load / is it stable
I just need to run the processor stress test, right?
so a timed run
i usually leave it on overnight when im pushing mine
interesting design
This looks like DOOM
What is it?
Currently Playing Marathon, Played by: Wreck
Temperature going up.
http://equestria.fadri.org/extra-01-nightmare-night <-- O.o Take a close look at Pinkie's costume. . .
Map: Custom map, made by Wrek
Nick, it will , up to maybe 65-70
I'll kill it when i reach 63
EspyLacopa: that's horrifying
Fun Fact: Doom is actually the story of a guy who borrowed $2 from Chuck Norris and didn't pay it back on time
Wrek needs health badly!
This looks so much like DOOM
58
Radu, same era
yeah
besides
I can't see the stream right now, stress test and all.
I hope I'm not becoming Ill
I feel warm
EVERYTHING looks like DOOM for the most part
xD
DOOM looks like DOOM
shocker
For some reasone FFT-z can't read the temp
needs more butt taze
not that kind of game
It appears tobe holding at 60
mein pretty friend has a tazer
thats pretty cool, whats the core voltage at?
The first thing I thought of when she showed it to me was "Wrek butt taze"
Stallion_of_War: if she's pretty she probably needs it
just remember
anyone ever ask if you want a candy bar?
run
The core voltage is in the bios right?
yeah, if you havnt changed it then leave it as it
as is*
She doesn't think she's pretty :(. I think she's beautiful :)
the voltage is a dangerous thing to play with
I messed with the built in overclocking settings
It was all autpomatic
und apparently she thinks I'm awesome :)
If it's holding at 60 with 100% load on 6 cores, surely i could go one step higher...
should be fairly good then, with temps of 60 you should be fine
dont push it so early
But it's not worth it
hmmmm
well
how news the chip btw?
Couple months old
having to constantly go back to recharge seems tedious tbh
Yeah dont push it much harder
the paste might not have settled properly
should have just put a recharge further along
It's idleing at 37 now
I feel like, bleh
Sweet, have a much better CPU now, in theory
lol, recharge further, as he is next to one
Nick, what GPU you got in there?
Radeon hd 6770
i had one of those before, nice cards
I might need to just chillax today
Why is it so bloody hot?
It's not as good as my CPU is, but it didn't cost hear as much.
/me wonders where a thermometer is
Well, I think I'ma go lay down or take a cold shower or something.
why not just look up the weather online?
I ment to take my own temperature
I feel warm
hmmmm
why am I commenting on this map?
somepony feel my brow
Wrek asked for comments on it
well taht's the thing
There, everything is as it should be, time to resume my day.
I don't know ANYTHING about Marathon and I thought that laast map he played that he beat was the whole game, not a fan map.
My stream is laggin like a mofo, stupid rural internet
I feel ya
Same here
I still enjoy country more than town though
argh
I'm going to name the little buffer cirlcle philip
give me a city any day
Hello again philip
I can't stand living in the city.
well, we got a tumbleweed here named Heely
Heh, if you ever make an OC, use it as your cutiemark
you can see him drift by when the caht is dead
I like the wide open area and privacy
Ok, i'm not THAT rural
Nick, I am
I HATE it
Either of you live in texas?
I'm isolated and can't go now where, no car
nope, eastern shore of MD
No, Georgia
in the middle of bucking nowhere
I need to find a brony meetup in houston
oh sure, we got a town 2 miles away but there is NOTHING there
I live about 10 minutes from a small town.
Maryland?
yeah in MD
on the eastern shore
Maryland is hardley as rural as where i grew up
ahem
THE EASTERN SHORE
sorry guys
We lived 6 hours away from any large city
im doin the dishes so i cant chat much
it's 90% farms down here
nothing but fucking fields and woods for miles at times
Its 80% chicken farms around here.
And how far were you away from D.C. 2 hours?
Nick: try 3 if the traffic is good
which it NEVER is
Traffic is never good
Ever
so more like 4.5
derp
The city we lived next to had traffic signals perfectly timed so that if you went exactly the speed limit, you hit every one.
I think Wrek should have put a Rocket Launcher in this level
lol Nick
Not even kidding, i made a map and everything
the only real challenge of this map
oh there it is
Purple death ?
yes
he's boned
giant mech thing and the teleporting mech things
screwed by his own map
he is ZBONED
inb4 ded

Anyone else thought that this: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-thor-is-a-pony1.png can be a R63 Wrek reference?
because his swag level is OVER 9000!!!
You're moving up in the world, hammer boy.

Wel..
If I keep posting comments

You've been official referenced as the R63 thor pony
wrek, your balls were made of some serious steel in that last fight
Wel..
Semi officialy
/me pats Wrek on shoulder.
It's all good

Hiya Davie
I'm also bug, so excuse any confusion
But not him
I'm me
...well, I'm bored now. I'm gonna download spirit tracks

Wrek's balls are not made of steel silly man. They are made of a brilliant combination of Mithril, Kryptonite, swagger diamonds and Titanium
Uhm, any idea how can I recover the password for my nick?
swagger diamonds?
nope
indeed
hell yes
Swagger Diamonds are best diamonds
so
Spike wishes he would have them
swagger diamonds,even stronger then regular diamonds
even spike couldnt eat swagger diamonds

>didnt happen
fml I just drank a glass of water on the counter and my mom goes "thats cody's glass"
/me stepps out of a corner of th room that leads to a dead end.
Cody is my dog and he is sick
-_-
Well. That is taken care of. Back to my armchair.
05here he came, here came speedracer?
00,10why does you dog have it's own glass?
/me cozies into armchair.
To The MOOn
i have no idea
That's indycar in a nutshell
but now i have dog aids
that dog must have a fancy life
lol
he really does
ROCKETMAN
05and now
inb4 we're blasting off again
05its boom time.
lol
Would have been cooler if the car flew off into the air.
I love pop rocks. =D
11,01This is old Mythbusters.
suddenly woman
I heard some kid died because of pop rocks
Rocketman? There is not such thing as a Rocketman. Now there is RawketLawnchair, formerly known as Rawketman and also the Rocketeer, but not Rocketman.
Ooh, THIS one
sounds interesting
BackgroundPony Ping
this is gruesome
this is !!science!!
Pig stomach tiem!
05nice...
i always see this guy lurkin but never speaks
for science!
he is a background pony
been awhile since I've had pop rocks.
^
BackgroundPonies peak on occaison
11,01We're out of pig stomachs, but we do have human stomachs.
butcher shop
I used to eat em
Sometimes multiple times with different voices
never had one. I don't even know what they are.
lol very very meaty swimming cap
filled pig stomachs are a south german delicatesse
I have a pony issue
?
Pop rocks are basically like ground up hard candy that fizzes in your moth
mouth*
00,10popricks are basicly Co2 and suger
you know how Bon Bon doesn't recognize Rarity in the fluttermodel episode?
and if ya swallow em too early you're screwed
He needs ALL the tubes!
Sumica: Dat poprocks.
Very yummy Co2 and sugar. =D
And what they're trying to do? Stuffing a pig's stomach with pop rocks?
ricks*
How is that possible?
they just have to hunt a pick
she is the element of generosity
11,01They should call an organ bank.
05oh well
saved equestria
05he doesnt need it anyways
here piggy piggy
they use SOO many pigs
They should just eat pop rocks and soda and see how it goes
lol
XD
I'll have to keep an eye out for pop rocks.
Anypony else hungry? =P
00,10I wonder when they will show the ep where they acadentealy shot a cannon through some guys house
best job eva
mentos + 2 Liter Soda= explosion
OK. Drifted off to watch the review... did the car explode?
Sumica: thought that episode like the RFID tag was banned from being aired ever
lol
dat drum
00,10could be, not sure as it just happed late last year and it takes times for them to edit the eps
yeah, usually a fair few months
we can be hopeful
OK. Drifted off to watch the review... did the car explode?
00,10no
I thought their banned episode involved hamsters that ate each other
twice
The car went wonderful
Wow.
No, they was testing the myth that RFID was unbreatable,
the car made a sonic rainboom
/me neighs with joy
:)
then got some legal pressure to never air the results
it was a bit disappointing...12 seconds acceleration and that was it
lol
or anything to do with any of it
even had to remove tweets saying they were going to do it
With the hamsters they were testing the myth that there's more nutrition in the cardboard box than the sugar cereal that's in it
#SillyFilly
mmmmm, cardboard
They had three different cages. The control with regular hamster food, one with sugar cereal, and one with cardboard pellets
00,10dat blurry coke
humans can't digest cellulose like hamsters
A qurat of Hydrocloric Acid.... this can't end well.
11,01Only ever seen HCl called Muriatic acid one more place.
The ones with the cardboard pellets started going nuts from hunger and ate each other
om nom nom
lol
that must hurt
Ictiv
I other words, belches and farts.
Beano
lol
doses
Extreme scenario, ACTIVATE!!!
I can think of no other program where the phrase "We're going to try to make out pig stomach explode" can be atken in stride.
Spam is for cowards. Spam makes you weak. Spam is for cleaning blood off that uniform and you don't get no blood on my uniform! Boy you must be outside your mind!
Taken.
We gonna explode that pig hurhurhur!
swag
yay
05is that pepsi or RC cola?

hey bug and Jim
These days, good cute. Past days, hotdogs were made of... iffy stuff.
It really depends on the dog and the brand.
Sausage inna Bun?
I don't care what some meats are made of.

11,01Hot dogs are made of dogs. Duh.
Some are made from leftover beef parts.

Is it ACTA?
Davie_Jones: Eeyup.
the acta
Still isn't as fun as an SEP field.
Start the podium session
Don't ACTA fool.
But do you pity one?
Well, I started the ACTA thing again. My work is complete.
Dash knows what the ladies like
I haven't read it, but if it is like SOPA or PIPA, then if the servers are within Europe's borders, then yes they are effected.
Im using this, pretty much...http://www.listentoyoutube.com/index.php
Doctor is best stalker
nuffin
Davie_Jones: it's worse than SOPA and PIPA
Davie_Jones: It also allows your ISP provider to monitor every packet of data you send out.
Companies might also have the power to strike at companies beyond the borders, but I don't know as I haven't read it.
Just the ISP?
censors, censors everywhere
no
Not sure, really.
Then if you don't live in Europe then it won't effect you I wouldn't think.
not censors, monitoring everywhere
Kammerjunk: You're on your computer now or do you still have to use your phone?
the dark ages are coming.....
Doctor has a press badge, he can get anywhere.
Davie_Jones: it's international
But really Europe. We warned you about this long ago.
What but...
He IS the doc
Ictiv: I'm using one of those fancy 3G sticks, but my modem won't arrive today.

*ben
ScootaChicken: That's a LOT of Skyrim.
lol Fazana
Ictiv: Don't go there!
Now I need to go back to trying to figure out what the answer to this case is. If you have played the second Phoenix Wright game, then please send me a message.
Oh that funny little dog.
Kammerjunk: I'm a wizard.
I think I can handle myself
Jack Harkness is on it like a car bonnet.
Do NOT go beyond series 4!
on google.de the first is weed in berlin...the rest skyrim
thank god I have the hub....so in case all the bill pass, which eventually will happen
And then notjimg sexual happened *Transition to doc*
/me looks around.
Davie_Jones: I have, pm me about it
Good for me. I didn't even meet the Master yet.
I got Skyrim, Skyrim, Skyrim and Minecraft

Best screwdriver.
Arkham Asylum?
I want one that works on wood :3
Albion..
Oh, wait, no.
/me thinks of fable.
Sonic screwdriver: If it stops the plot, it doesn't.
it's powered with green rocks
LOL DED GUYS. I think they are dead.
A screwdriver that worked on wood would probably only work on wood and nothing else
dey not ded...
Zombies!
how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
They're not dead, they are continiueing to be dead.
All of it
Jim: I don't suppose the timey wimey argument would work here?
It's timey wimey, everything is
The bomb that isn't a bomb.
ScootaChicken: As much wood as a woodchuck would chuck.
Victor Meldrew
A screwdriver can't work on wood for timey wimey reasons
Incoming creepy moment.
Seems sensible to me.

Nope

Morgan Freeman for 11th.

Hold it!, where's yo proof?
Rowan Atkinson for 11th Doctor
^
He is so good in the sport relief episode
yes he was and is
I can't believe you guys don't like moffats writing.
I wouldn't be able to take Doctor Who seriously anymore if Rowan Atkinson became the next doctor
What's treaming?
Dr. Who
I don't always dislike the latest writing.
a good ep too
MAEOOOARRRJMMMYYYY
How horrifying.
I don't know what treaming is.
moffats?
Ahh, ok cool
it's not the writing
I never said that (though I hate the angel episodes after Blink)
it's the actor
what a heroic scene O.o
The shitty acting is what gets me. :/
So you don't like matt smith.
>don't like
he hates Matt Smith
inb4 train runs him up
Jack is everyone's type.
Lul
But, he's acting the character
Matt isn't bad at acting, his script is bad IMO
Dari wants M.S to die.
lol
and i cant blame him.
dance=fuck?
But, i feel hurt.
DANCEY DANCE
I haven't seen enough of him to form an opinion
run youidiot!
don't touch him!

Matt Smith isn't a serious Doctor, he's a random one.
I've seen 2 seasons of him
I like trains

Mask barf
Entire team, is pyros!
Who is the best Doctor? a) Doctor Who b) Doctor House c) Doctor Sherlock d) Doctor Whooves
You decide
D
The matt smith episodes are among my favorite, but i can understand that it might not to be most peoples taste
Tennant's Doctor
For sure
I'm baaaaack
A on the condition that it's Tennant
Absolutely
Doctor House = Doctor Who
if not, D
mfw people are talking about Matt Smith
Tennant is best doctor
I like Smith's humor - The Fez, The Wibbly Lever, trolling The Silence into killing themselves
D is for Doctor
It's a space ambulance.
imagine mlp fim runs as long as dr who
Tennant woud've been so mush better i he wasn't complaining and bitching about rose the whole series
eyyyyyy
Stallion_of_War: Not Smith's style so much as the writing

I like Matt, but he wasn't nearly good as Tennant
Oh ok. I'd be ok with that.
But it's so horrible D:
maaan, iv been here for 8 hours
Hugh Grant as 12th doctor
The one we just saw the preview for

Matt's script is really bad compared to Tennants

Ingwaz: Flim Flam Brothers ftw

I found every sn=ingle DW seriel in order, and watched them all (or at least what was available on netflix)
I liked the Doctor-Donna
i hated donna's attitude, but yes... she was funny sometimes
She was only there for like, 15 minutes thoughy
Midnight - Yup
I thought it was hilarious when Donna started acting like The Doctor
yeah she's still kicking
donna noble has left the library
donna noble has been saved
Ohh that...
I liked Donna
That was terribad
Those were weird episodes

Pokemon 3DS had better do away with friendcodes
1,3its Nintendo, so probably not
with the global friends list on 3ds, might not need it?
05,15friendcodes y u so long
because nintendo
Man, I am liking what I am hearing about the Wii U.
Is there something on right now? I've got a player in my window but every time I press play it does nothing.
nintendo can't even grasp the power of the internet, you trust them with pvp?
because nintendos were never really good at online.
05,15nothing's on at the moment
>.>
<,<
K, I thought my computer was screwing up
soooo.... good idea
bad idea
o-o?
for anyone who wants it, my pokemon white friendcode is: 2923-8263-6840
Dashie_Dashie - that's because Nintendo's focus on being a family console means they do everything they can to keep two people as separate as possible online
if it's any relevence I nom on my goatee sometimes.
mini tourney?
over wifi?
bad idea
mine's 5
o-o why?
It would be unfair
how so?
because I would win
LOL
05,15Am I the only one that DOESN'T want the next gen of consoles to come out?
E3 is gonna blow everyone's perception on nintendo
and that ruins the fun
I don't fluttercry.
it really depends what those consoles can offer fluttercry
(and if i can get a job)
unless it's like fullblown throw you in the game 3d simulator.
who knows, maybe someone on Bronystate could outmatch you o-o
wii u graphics look awesome (considering its a wii)
to hell with next gen
ORRR we can play 3vs 1
naw
Hey guys. been a while.
I would know if there was someone
http://derpy.me/Rldzh
you know why?
know how you feel, feels like this generation pretty much brought a whole lotta stuff
Phase4, whats that link?
05,15Chaospony the name seems familiar
my attempt to work failed some more
I wish
because I would know if they were on smashboards
Why o-o
lol
Dashie_Dashie: image
and that determines alot
fluttercry: why dont you want the next gen? this ones become so stagnant
it gives me a warning when I go to it.
Not surprised :T
Dashie_Dashie: huh, thats odd
05,15Because, 1) money 2) I really don't see the need
i hope the next gen brings less CoD *shudders*
its not just about who plays alot
05,15I'm fine with what we have right now
Dashie_Dashie - looks like poonibooru to me
its about people who play alot and are aware of a higher level of game play
i tis
That is an awesome flash game
it is'
2 of the 3 consoles are glorified, underpowed, proprietary computers
05,15RainbowcrashNBurn You think Activision would EVER let that happen?

/me has no idea what you're talking about
the other one is the same, but has exclusives worth investing in
XD
I think graphics have gone as far as they can. You know those live action games that just feel wrong?
05,15FMV games...PHANTASMAGORIA
basically there are a number of things that determine a good smasher
nxPaqu, they really havnt, so much of it is faked and not actually done in real time
maybe they're under a different name o-o? on that board thingy
maybe...
Meh, if they come out with something new, it better blow my mind.
but then again i would still know
there are alot of really good lighting/shadowing techniques which there simply isnt enough power to do in real time
i mean I once requested Wombo Combo on the stream
you cant miss that
There's still super-high resolution TVs, which Consoles will want to use and trick us into thinking we need.
maybe they're offline :O
05,15look at Dark Souls, that game is beautiful. I really don't think a new generation could improve on that enough for me to consider buying it
so be it
More 3D games would be cool, once 3D TVs become cheaper
05,15at least not in the beginning
Oh, by Celestia's Beard... there's a new show called "Doomsday Preppers".
/me returns to #opers, seeing that his work has been done
lol, 3d is a terrible idea
ruins gameplay
plus out of ALL the people that could be on here that are on smashboards,
Really? I haven't tried it yet, it just sounds cool
im pretty sure a mere hundred could beet me
But yeah, we've pretty much plateau'd when it comes to graphics. Game at this point will only look amazing if they have several hundred people working on the game.
I got it on my graphics card where it can force most games to run in 3d
*beat
Tovler: did you get my friend code, if so ill meet you in wifi-room
and the chances of that are slim
its great for films etc, the depth can add alot to a movie
Lol
RainbowcrashNBurn: Ok, I'll head there too
05,15I still feel that 3d is a gimick
it is
VS
BRONYSTAE
oh my.... i did not think this through
but a game is too fast and needs too much finesse, and 3d takes away in terms of control
yep XD
it's always been a gimmick
Ok I think I'm going to stop lurking...
this shall be a fun tournament indeed ^^
my pla pad stuff has been deleted coz im using my 3ds instead of ds lite :O
05,15I saw Avatar, in 3d and in normal. Yeah I saw the difference, but it's not worth the extra money
/me glomps emangamer for the sake of it
05,15plus, anything 3d gives me a headache
Melee would make my chances even more probable
yeah same here
which tech did you use?
hiya emangamer
Super Mario 3D Land sold me to 3D
since, well I kinda got 33rd at Apex 2012 XD

Oh, and Todd in the Shadows
yes, but isn't it ironic that the only Big Mac episode we knew of before hand was one where he was going to say ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for the entirety of it?
yep
Todd in the Shadows <3
xkcd refferenced pony
Favorite last words: What's that clicking noise
the clip of fluttershy apparently being embarresed she's sleeping in the nude...or maybe she predicted this scene being REALLY abused...

00,03I like Dari's words of wisdom, but unfortunately, my college wants it to make sense :(
i liked Mystara's Little Ponies, for example, but that was less Humans in Equestria as it was Equines in D&D
LordCelestia|Fanfic: sat shameless self promotion
Dawwwww
My favorite quote: "If you have a recipe for a shitty cake, and you always use that recipe, then youll always get a shitty cake."
