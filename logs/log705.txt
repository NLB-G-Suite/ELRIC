XD
is Canary sad D:?
I don't think she wants to talk about it.
^
It would only confirm his strange idea that I have a horse obsession
allright.
id ask him why he likes a language that doesn't scale.
understandable :)
^
Xam.
wtf
wow Breaking Bad is pretty good
:)
I STILL need to watch that show. :D
me too
you should, it's awesoem
I think he just jumped on it because it was the newest bandwagon a couple years ago or something
he was in Malcolm in the Middle
and it wasnt right?
because it is hard to scale and resource intensive.
everything I'm hearing says it was only a fad and only the fanboys are clinging on to it
even when I'm running it locally it's sooo slow
And I don't even find it easy to use
I think all the conventions and crap are confusing
it complains if you make a slight mistake in how it wants you to name something
at least php has a decade of support and stability behind it.
^
Its awesome :)
hilarious
Too bad the anime's over.
yea
The manga's still going on, just not the anime.
yeah
Dken2021_: it seems to work really considering I have just a controller
Lots of fun shit and epic battles :)
Oh its this :D
I saw like 5 episodes then i forgot then name
but its awesome!
ohh shiz Gurren Lagann
dat good show
yea, that one's ok, though I like the second half more
Oh you know any on going series?
One Piece?
Bleach?
Bleach sucks
fairy tail
BALLS
/me stabs Colday in the back as his way of saying he has returned
Dam you Socks
it's "Systems Development"
:P
:D
bleach is done isnt it?
They just ended like that..
nop
oh..... that project isn't due till the 28th.... well that's nice to know
oh they did finally?
It's not.
You wish it was finished.
Aww :(
its on break?
I would prefer to watch a show that I know has an end
geez, bleach must be going for the record of longest running anime of all time
the manga is stil lchuging along at 512 Socks
epi 366
Oops
O.O wow
actualy one piece hold that record i belive
but i don't minds it's hiarious
oh yea, forgot that one is also going too
SOCKS ARE COOL!
Oh i havent watched Onepiece
:P
I have to go to work, bbl
one piece is good
though
it just very very boring
meh
i gave up watching one piece. i read it now insted
one piece has been going on way too long
One Piece is really good, I need to get back into it.
Anyone know a show that have the Animation quality equall to FMA: Brotherhood?
*.
Cause Fma:Bh had awesome animations
?
I still need to finish FMA.
^ same
YOU HAVENT FINISHED FMA?!
i stop watching one piece because i forgot were i left off at
Neither have I
Fma is amazing!
Watch it
Yui- Again , best intro song Imo
friggin naruto
i still dont know were i left off at
:P
!cd
?
Why not?
I'm still on the Sabaody arc, myself.
naruto wasn't that bad.....well then again, I left off when they when sasuke's brother was introduced
:P
fma?
I would've loved it if they kept the characters young in Naruto.
One piece
But I lost all interest in Naruto when Shippuden came out.
the only reason i watch naruto was for lee, and now that he has his own spinoff show there is no reason to watch or read naruto at all
Socks, you mean enel?
buny?
*binny
*bunny
Dken2021_: Yeah, she did.
naruto would be a good show... if the characters wouldnt use up 95% of the episode talking bullshit
I loved the Skypiea saga. :D
^
still is
haha
wait
hahaha
Either that or Impel Down.
I loved it

There's a 10 episode filler arc a while after that, but besides that, yes. The fillers are very sporadic. It's probably because the episodes are padded to fill out the full 21 minutes that they have.

ignore my horribru typing
She was only 70k away
i failed at spelling fail
Now I understand. Even though she clears the requirements for an event, it doesn't end until her time runs out. Sorry for not understanding before
I like that there are no pedestrians whatsoever.
on the highway?
Anywhere.
where I live, they get fined when there
Presumably in the kind of society that lets drivers do this all over the main road everyone has just learned to stay indoors.
Courier services must be lucrative.
carmageddon actually got banned in many countries for the pedestrian splattering
and thats why most racing games have no pedristrians
they had to replace pdestrians with zombies
cause zombies have no feelings
i like da way you think <Meanwhile
:)
Can you blame me?
Look at you.
bad...imagination...don't know the fitting word
they are replacing the people with zombies
WTF

05,15Personally I despise drinking, though I wouldn't mind trying cider some time
05,15See, if I go to Scotland to study in a few years, I'm going to be completely lost and have no idea what's going on, but at the same time it'd be FREAKING AWESOME

08,01*uni
08,01but i'm not staying there
08,01anyhoos, raisin weekend
08,01this is a really old tradition
08,01so when you're in third/fourth year at St Andrews Uni, you adopt academic children
08,01i have an academic son and an academic daughter
Saturn: seems legit
08,01and in october, there is Raisin Weekend
08,01Raisin Weekend is kinda special
08,01it's a family bonding time
08,01usually involving a lot of alcohol
toodles!!
08,01i'll take you through it step by step
^
08,01where tea is generally booze

No we shouldnt but
08,01anyhoos
,,,?
sorry Saturn lol
moving along
Is there a stream on?
MOVING FORWARDS~
00,03v_v
08,01sorry, a pound of raisins
There is potential and we are working on this to make one for us all, night everypony
I like grapes. :3
working*
Me too :3
08,01anyhoos, nowadays "raisins" translates to "wine"
08,01because they're both made from grapes
I am liking the idea of all of this
hehehe
08,01this is where the fun starts
08,01you see, a Raisin Receipt can be anything
08,01including bits of old furniture, 22" CRT monitors, fridges, etc.
fridges...
/me sighs and says "Bye Everybody"
08,01anything old, bulky, and awkward to carry down the street
05,15Shizu done streaming? Awww well it was fun!
08,01cowvarkian: it has been done in the past
^
Saturn: hmm
*^^
13huh?
hahaha
13when did this happen
08,01anyhoos, you need to write a statement in latin on it
08,01more about the latin later
05,15Everyone was saying thanks for stream, which is usually the signal that it's over
^^:D
^^^^
^^^^^^
*^^^
hi everypony!
00,03Thanks for the stream, fluttercry!
carats, everywhere!
05,15But I don't stream!
05,15....yet
00,03You will!
I MISSED A STREAM? NUUUUU
05,15BUT WHEN I DO!
08,01and they make their way, dresses in a ridiculous fashion, and carrying their raisin receipt, to the quad
08,01now, earlier i mentioned the latin
:)
:3
wut
i liek power rangers
00,03:|
00,03:D
08,01this is something along the lines of "i (academic parent's name) have given this raisin receipt as according to the traditions of the University of St Andrews, founded in [pick one of 1411, 1413, or 1414]"
00,03xbox~
Saturn: hmm
00,03I'll get it after Halo 4!
08,01you're just meant to pick one of those years at random
Halo 4~
WHOS GONNA STREAM NEXT?
00,03Because rasins
00,03WOAH
08,01anyhoos, on their way to the quad, they can be stopped by a graduate student and inspected
oh my.
08,01and they have to check that the latin is correct
08,01which, of course, it never is
00,03PS3? MLG? Sonnnn you best be crazy~
08,01because the date is always wrong
08,01(because there are 3 to choose from)
i like PS3 ...
^
i like all consoles
08,01so the poor first years then have to recite the uni song
^
same
Good news everyone!
08,01anyhoos, upon reaching the quad, there is a massive foam fight
08,01cowvarkian: yup
:3
08,01i swear, i am not making this up
08,01it has been happening for hundreds of years
>foam fight
08,01cowvarkian: then they feel incredibly embarassed
>old tradition
awesome!
:D
08,01actually, the foam fight is the only part of the whole thing i have no idea where it stems from
Saturn: scotland?
Saturn: maybe thats where
08,01...
i want a halo assault rifle...
08,01:P
Saturn: heh
waitin for DI:R
08,01anyhoos, it's this weekend
08,01so i must stock up on booze
08,01and find a couple of worthy raisin receipts
