00,10it's amazing what faust was able to do with this
Dude, there'e thunder outside. I scared.
most ameture stuff is better than this
Because in Soviet Russia we use mind to make mouth move
better music can be made on Impulse Tracker :[
i'm wonderign how this ever aired. the voice actors sound like random kids they baited with candy and the animation budget was a banana and half a sandwch
Sumica: She didn't use this. She used G1
00,10makes dusk dawn look good dont it
YEAH! FUCK THAT SCARF!!

Dark_Horst: It didn't. It never aired-- it was Striaght to video-- and SOME FOOLS BOUGHT IT.
i'm rooting for the storm
Sumica: fasut based her show on g1, this is somethign entirely different

DON'T DIE ON ME CHAT!
TheRandomkid321, surely you could survive with 6 hours of sleep. :P

Aren't you a cool kid.
Jmo: you comment on literally everything I say.

Hehe, yeah, I try to keep it at 6-7, I don't know all the why's and such, but QI and others have said 6-7 is the golden medium-
Hai everypony
Hello DerpyMuffins
Hey DerpyMuffins
Phase4 playing minecraft again?
Mhhm
eyup
if I got to sleep at 10:30pm and wake up a 7am I have 7 hours and 30 min right?
Vivix, not wise to trust everything QI says though, they have recieved criticism for inaccuaracy before (most of which has been rectified by QI though)
True, alot of what they say are "teeechnically" or "Kiiindaa" or sometimes even "not really"
but, that one seems to have been repeated elsewhere as well
what is QI?
all the lags
English show about interesting facts
hello
Hello Comfortabler
sometimes downright wrong (Frequency vs pitch) and sometimes just technically right, but usually funny
hello AdamTheDuck
QI is awesome don't get me wrong, but you should fact check it. :)
Agreed, totally
If anypony hasn't seen QI, fix that!
Awww I didn't get to say goodnight to Sumica :(
:(
Phase4 I got some more music for ya. One song though.
QI is a lot of fun, especially the XL, where you get that extra bit of silly things from the guests
theres a bunch of stuff happening here
Hello Phase4 :)
I don't get why they don't just make XL the normal show. :/
might have to stop streaming
I might actually head off to sleep early tonight
At least give us the ip Phase4? No? Well it was worth a try.
Have a great night everyone :)

Phase4 Can you please play the song I requested? That's all I ask... Sorry to pester you :$

Phase4 I request that you play whatever song you want
TheRandomkid321, after this one

Phase4: It worked fine for me when I was playing OC with some friends.
80 ping or so
It wasn't me running the server though, so that's why ping wasn't horrible.
look at all the resources
i think this is enough minecraft for now
ohshit1:30idbettergonighteveryone
if i'm still playing tomorow
XD
XAX, night xax
Phase4, night phase4
if i'm still playing tomorow, i'ma build a mass fabricator and neuclear reactor
think i've got enough uranium for it
Rope?
O.o
Bombs?
You want it?
So Phase4 you will never let others on now?
lets watch the diamonds climb
TheRandomkid321, it can't handle it :(
D:
Phase4 It will never ever be able to handle it? :'(
Are you able to put passwords on your server thing?
Phase4: run server on uni pc huehue
look at all those diamonds
RaveBrony, yeah
dem Toms
TheRandomkid321, i'd need to move it to a different machine
don't have another suitable machine right now
Phase4 You willing to put that to the test Phase?
Phase4 I mean.
i might have to pipe right from the furnace into the condenser
this produces a LOT of stuff
Phase4: I'd run it for you if my net weren't atrocious.
Phase4. yes your IP worked... Now I am going to have to resist one of the greatest temptations ever.
My machine is alright. I could probably play with you while running it. But my net is 3rd world-tier.
TheRandomkid321, :<
Phase4 Can I just test if it will work?
TheRandomkid321: We get it. You have his server ip. But we've moved on from minecraft for now.
TheRandomkid321, dont
Stop bugging the poor thing.
Okay...
where did my wrench go
/me lurks, kind of
Phase4: On the floor.
Cya everypony
all dose resources
Listen Phase4. If the minute chanch that you suddenly can let people on. Let me know and I'll be on in a jiffy... Until then... Well I'll just not think about it ^_^
Phase4: >yfw you haven't touched CSS since you bought it
:c
XD
XAXzzz, i bought it for garys mod
Lol
Phase4: :c okay.
silly sky spiders
What do you do on Gmod anyway?
I bought it, played it...and just threw metal balls around....
:I
RaveBrony: build stuff/dick around with character models
dat mfsu
its draining
this is bad
O.o
its a lot of effort to assemble more solar cells though
I possess what I thoguht to be a great hting... but now I find is a curse... That's it i'm going to delete taht IP and all traces of it!I can no longer take the fustration!
There Phase4 For you I deleted the server and the file containing the IP.
/me hugs TheRandomkid321
And we shal never speak of this again.
dem ghost
Anyway Phase4 can I just ask you one more thing before going to bed?
i'ma cheat in some solar panels so i can leave this alone
TheRandomkid321, yeah?
Phase4 Is there any logical chanch of the server ebing open for people?
if i can get a bigger machine to host it
and taht's not likely is it Phase4?
not at this point in time
Aw well... Mayy if I wish hard eneough the magic fairy princess will grant my wish :3
i wish a mythological creature really exist :3
like unicorns and such
Anyway i'm off to bedsies. I'll presumably see you Phase4 streaming again omorrow night?
possibly
oh bai TheRandomkid321
i should probably get to bed early tonight
morning, everypony :)
ohai Sylandest its evening here though :)
ahh, howdy, valoreins! :) And is it? Then good evening! hehe
:D
urgh
this is anoying
theres an apache2.4 package in the exeprimental repo
but i can't install it
so what do?
how bizare
oh btw Sylandest what do you think about this? http://i.imgur.com/M5k15.jpg
valoreins: that looks marvelous! I can't wait to see the finished product!
thanks... but, the problem i dont feel like continuing this..
is*
valoreins: oh? why not?
some people in my group complaints about celestia's heavy armor lol
valoreins: which part brings the most objection from them?
heyo. I'm back :)
the shoulder, i really need to rethink of a new design
damn military
wb, Eli
ohai Eli
hi. seems like the military liked me more then i like them :P
Hi everybody :)
hi The_Engineer
ohai The_Engineer
valoreins: the idea that came to my mind was to maybe change the texture that you have Celestia's shoulder armor done up as. It seems rigid, while Luna's is more loose. Maybe you could revise it that way?
Whose streaming?
who's streamin?
xD
yea it's the texture, her shoulder is actually not finished texturing yet
stupid debian
valoreins: well, then you still have room to finish! Don't go knocking a good artwork when its not even done yet! :P
Eli, The_Engineer: i am
Phase4 ;D
thought so Phase4
Phase4: what's the music? sounds damn interesting
what is Phase4 trying to do?
i know.. but i already lose my drawing "spirit"... sucks to be me so easily depressed
valoreins: just came back here. wat textures?
/me hugs valoreins
the_real_pony_1604, install apache 2.4 on a debian system
phase
its proving dificult
/me hugs Sylandest back
valoreins: then we'll just have to poke it back into action! hehe.
The_Engineer, yeah?
<3
i wub you
/me hugs The_Engineer
/me hugs Phase4 back
I'm eating cookies with tea ;3
alright, i think its not good being depresed so easily
wait...thats wrong I wanted milk...
what's the music Phase4? I really wanna know :(
/me ruffles valoreins' mane
Valoreins is a PONY?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL_zhGHP4o0&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=5
:$
valoreins: then we'll keep your spirits up! You've no reason to quit just yet, mister! OR miss. whatever you may be.
kay, thanks for the encouragement
Phase4: pony musicians??? fuck they are GOOD!
:)
Phase4: i be on le youtube
valoreins: :) I'm sure if you keep at it, it'll turn out wonderful. Just take into account what folk say so you can edit it before you finish. Believe me, it looks great! You've no reason to give up on it!
damn
i could use the experimental package
but that'd require a dist-upgrade to sid
no shsuh
alright, think it's time for me to be busy~
Phase4 what browser you using? looks like MozFox
The_Engineer, nightly
valoreins|Drawing: thats the spirit! :)
its the unstable build of firefox
nightly?
unstable?
its built once every night
Phase4: make the internet go boom
Whats the difference between unstable and stable?
JRP, i'd rather not
i've got stuff stored there
The_Engineer, ones prone to exploding
Phase4: i found your facebook
/me says in a twilight voice:
I don't get it
i'm using it cause its aparently the only way to get 64 bit firefox
for windows anyway, linux and mac have had 64bit for years
Oh ok
so watcha doin in there/
i mean the site
There's a shoe in my snake
So kicked in the dick?
he is trying to install some software into an odd ball OS
and not having much luck
"Frankly, a yellow box is a bit optimistic"
mmk
the_real_pony_1604, its hardly odd ball
hahaha
Phase4: make it go bookm
debian servers are the most popular servers out there
Oh god
aghhh
Too much cookies. Now I feel sick
The_Engineer, with reason, its great, i'm doing wierd stuff hence the broken
The_Engineer, eat so much cookie the sickness rolls over and becomes health
i ate 12
;3
only 12?
sissy
D:
:o
Phase4: There's a shoe in my snake.
oreo, or the 5lb chocolate chip?
Chocolate chops
i love chocolate chip cookies
theres a few spesific brands here that are really nice
snickerdoodle, my fav
i like the blue cookie box
should make my own at some point
I dont remember its name though
The_Engineer, its either debian or ubuntu servers
Its a blue box with cookies on it and its brand name. i ate it as a child
XED
but they're very similar opperating systems
Wrong persoN?
to th epoint that they share packages
Phase4 were you meant to message me?
derp
the_real_pony_1604, i ment you
and the mesages before also
derp
needs sleep
Phase4
I would believe ubuntu, we have 4 flavors of that at work. no debain
i'm getting a double cream oreo and eating it with ma tea
Brb all
/me is now afk
Phase4: gtfo and sleepies please
Did he get le sleepy?
nope
there
what are you trying to build? I thought I saw tekkit there
the_real_pony_1604, my tekkit server is on the same machine, i want apache 2.4 on debian but don't want to build my own package
Phase4 you going away now cause you stopped streaming
seems that to get that though i'd need to upgrade to sid and i'd rather not
The_Engineer, yeah, sleep, ineed sm
some'
brains giiving out
interesting..... I wish you luck with that sir!
night all
the_real_pony_1604, its not actually 2.4 that i want, its the mod_proxy improvments. mod_fastcgi is a terrible stupid broken thing and 2.4 fixes that
haha, nice.
fuck this nick
much better
the_real_pony_1604, srsly though, try configure php-fpm with apache 2.2, its imposible to make it work like mod_php
That's weird, the first episode they aired for the FiM italian dub was the Canterlot Wedding O_o
phase bed
no thanks, my computer building skills stops at windows. but if you want me to build the hardware for your server thats a different thing. ;)
hey, can i have the next survey link?

This makes me want to play Symphony.

Coldays: Yep
Domo~
YAAAY Flutterwonder :$
Yay
Yaaaaay~
:[ you shall win this
hey guys
hi artist
i saw something scary searching for this site on google
Google gonna google.
Yaaaaaay~
the search on google are differents depending of your location
Domo: who's your favorite pony?
indeed yaaaaaaaay
YES
U.N. Owen was best pony.
i typed equestria, and the first thing that showed up was "equestria after dark" ._.
bring da pain
Ahahaha
all i was ever looking for was equestria DAILY
artist you might have a "history record" for google ^^
Google does use your search history. Its greatest asset is also a curse.
ive never searched for something like that before.....
+ im using inkognito
so it's a curse
I'm fairly certain Google hasn't considered ponies.
:D
artist: Your search history, not your browser history.
not my pc >_>
Kammerjunk: never searched it
Again, it's hardly a perfect system.
Joke's on Google, though. I'm blocking trackers.
She can put target to God, she gobble gay!
other than google thinking im a clopper, whats up?
Here's a little secret: The Earth is round. THERE IS NO UP OR DOWN
And to conclude, what do you found search for Osu ? (my curiosity is killing me)
Frenchy_pony: Rhythm is just a click away.
yupp
Comes on stream and random gangdamstyle... Awesome
eyupp
Suddenly, Alex S.
i dont want to do my homework......why does my teachers hate me?!
Oh right, I only have one math assignment this week.
luckyyyyy
I can't remember the Rule of Cosines, though. Oh well, Google.
when is halloween?
The 30th, I think.
I dunno, I don't celebrate it.
dat pinkamena
and 31st
Oh.
As far as I can recall, pictures were never banned during streams.
oh, i mean for the halloween thingy
Oh. I can't draw worth my life.
WHAT THE HELL
Yes, MadSurge?
Italian Sailor Moon theme? :D
Them bananas
I 'unno, I cannot Italian.
It's more different from Latin than I'd like.
05oo ponies are in levels gaming mag
Kammerjunk: I can and IT IS :D
05picture inc
Sup suckas?
MadSurge: i wish i could do italian, its sounds awesome
Kammerjunk: not sure which season though
I need more music...=w=;
:D
Yeah, me too.
dont we all
I have, what, 17 GB? Not enough, at any rate.
^
dammit Kam
Ha ha,
goddammitcommakey
;~;
What's goin' on?
What isn't?
Lots of stuff.
Ohai Domo
This brings new meaning to the word "Fruitbowl"
I really like fruit.

Speaking of which, I might have some apples downstairs.
05there we go
100
Lil_B: really? .__.
Lil_B: Still, it's one small step for a mare.
I think i'm the only person who actually did something for crazy hair day at my school...
Crazy hair day? Is that a thing?
Osu! :D
Kammerjunk: Yep
05was still fun to see it in the article
Because my hair is approximately 1½ cm.
05cant escape ponies
MadSurge yes, the speaker said they don't trust aall of us to behave kids friendly :P
sesure worthy
Brony for life wrek even if you slip away for some time
I spiked my hair and covered it in silleh string
Lil_B: Unreasonable is what it is. The Internet houses the most trustworthy people I can think of.
Lil_B: I understand no gore, but you can just ban people with obscenities as cutie marks
Lil_B: OF COURSE IT WILL
MadSurge: But not before they're made, lest you want a character-approval system.
The game will have a large selection of hats, it appears.
Speaking of hats, I hope they keep the hat-tower bug in the game.
That was fun.
MadSurge I don't think you can ban every guy with a bad Cute-Mark, escpecially when it has a lot of players
oh yes! they mentioned the Hats!
You can't get on FB here... but I can get on tumblr?
They said "We want to have atb least one more hat than TF2!"
I still don't know how they'll support their servers if it's supposed to be free. Then again, many private MMO servers work on a donation-based system, and they get along.
May i ask what was the previous song?
Viva la Vida by Coldplay
Did not heart that
Sounded like a vocaloid song
I hear Vocaloid is pretty good.
Depends on who uses it.
Kanye West?
yes Kanye Powers Activate
Coldays: Good gracious, man. No one man should have all that power.
Power by Kanye West
No one mare should have all that friendship.
what about the power of major west?
and yes i do belive i should have all dat power
The song I just finished playing was Kyven's All Beginning
and i hate this computer. freezing everything :I
Aww :(
*Poof* Coldays became a gay fish
thats a cold computer
Eli: As long as he didn't become a Babel Fish.
Hoody|Skool: o u
Domo: I'm really interested in the song that played before that one
Kammerjunk: what's a babel fish?
I dont have gills and i dislike Fishdicks in my mouth
Kammerjunk: :3
oh taht was THE best song live :)
begin the bannana rain!
Awwww yeah, Coldplay!
Eli: Hitchhiker's Guide. Translates stuff when you stick it in you ear.
Exploding bananas
My god
A wild sticky keys appears.
your ear*
Hey, bananas are good. I like bananas.
Good source of potassium.
:O he be playin my request Yaaaaay!
"I don't care what others say, I like coldplay. deal with it" -David Tennant
/me flps onto Kammerjunk
Eli: Every time I read that, I can't help but imagine David with sunglasses.
Hoody|Skool: wat
I meant to flip, but my finger slipped and I said flp
Well, that was a flop.
so many bell's
I tried to flip, but i slipped and tripped, now i feel like a dip
I think coldplay made my general gaming philosophy: just because i'm losing doesn't mean i'm lost :)
Them bells
I've*
you've
Alright I gotta go. Latas people
Bye Hoody
I think B.J. Thomas made my life philosophy: Cryin's not for me, 'cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'.
Hey everypony

Hello there my dear gentlebros
ello Jake
I'm confused, where are you getting 30s from
41:33--41:58
It is 10
Hai Jake
hi Jake
Actually you have a point.
I see what you're talking about SafariMonkey.
Jmo: Barb|CosmonautPony sent 6 messages between 41:33 and 41:58, so that is 25s
Yeah just checked the timing myself. odd
i still give credit to typing speed
blame it on the lag
Haah you got cheated Barb.
maybe wrek's bot had a bad connection and got them all at once?
Possible.
well bots are a bit wonky sometimes
ha Wonky i dont know what that meens:P
yeah pretty impressive typing speed Barb|CosmonautPony, no more than 5s each
You're wonky. :<
nyo windows is messing with my tablet again

As Holly from Red Dwarf would say, "Alright dudes, what's 'appnin'?"
Or rather, Hello

Panda just don't degrade yourself again. Only I am allowed to do that to myself.
Otherwise there will be more hugs
Lawl.
Jmo: I couldn't tell if that was for me
:)
They air BBC shows here as well.

Jmo is african!
Jmo: I know
Na I'm Mexican.

Nope
You black
Keep trying and you will find out.
Panda: I'm african. One african limit; out jmo!

Hey MadSurge
one pony leaves and another joins hi MadSurge
hi MadSurge
hey MadSurge
what was the "repeat action" key for photoshop again?
yo MadSurge
Is life Mad and Surgefull?
Jake: ctrl t no?
no that is transform
Jake: then i forgot
Socks: *Surgeful
Shift Ctrl Y?
Alt F4?
Ah, sorry
Is anything streaming or am I not the only one staring at this white circle?
Socks: Nice to see you, I expected you to post before now. :P
ctrl-U
Socks: Yes. Yes it is!
I had posted, my greeting was swallowed up!
9 minutes.
Ok
Socks: Sorry
np :P
i see da circle
Socks: Red dwarf, eh? :P
Love Red Dwarf, have you seen the new series?
oh that's out now?
Yep
And it's GOOD!
Which is amazing
Socks: I'm sorry to say that as I don't have a TV I only see shows that I find myself, and I only found it recently
what is Red Dwarf?
Socks: I started on s3, I believe
it's a sci-fi comedy
SafariMonkey, That is a good series, the first 2 have a fond place in my heart
i like syfi and comedy
All of the series are really good :)
Socks: Because I was told that the earlier ones weren't a good starting point. Like starting Dr Who on S1 TOS, but to a lesser extent
then ill have to start frome the start. now where is the start?
Socks: I'll be sure to watch them sometime
The first 2 are good but the show changes drastically from S3 onwards, it's way more sitcom-y with s1 and s2
Socks: As opposed to?
Less than 3 weeks \:3/ wooooooo!
Well it happens way more on the ship as opposed to s3 onwards when they run around in starbug a lot and go to places
And then WallDives showed up, everyone hide...
(\/)!!(\/) I'm a crab!
ikr?
/me hides with Jmo
:P
yea, haven't seen much of it, but it did surprised me when they did all that stuff
Panda: AndroIRC has its uses, eh?
Socks, no@ you have crabs
There are crabs in my socks! :O
Waaaaaaat

Dark_Horst: I'm finding out where everyone's from

SafariMonkey: where you from :D?
Coldays: I hadn't realised.
You have 3 guesses

Ok, sorry Mighty Mods!

Meh, I'm in one of my least favorite classes
You mean Ditzy?

She wasn't Derpy
i ment the derpy that had a voice over after that hate mail
i thought that was ditzy
Socks: I'm fine with both Derpy and Ditzy :P
I didn't mind that new voice of Derpy.
Even though I MUCH prefer the original one.
ditzy derpy doo im confused with all of you
AJIsAwesome: could be a lot worse, even though I was fine with the other voice too
I have opinoins on derpy that take a long time to explain
hey AJIsAwesome
Ditzy was going to be Derpy's original name.
Is the stream on?

Faust wanted to have this easter egg pony that would pop in and out secretly between the show. When she saw that we made our own fan character (Derpy), she decided to use her instead.

Can the community request stuff to stream?

Should stream stuff like dexter, then
Socks: SOmetimes, if the mod wants to stream requests.

Same. :D"
exept for the many knife wounds iv had a good morning
Not a lot of people to talk to at my college.
Hey

Hai Randomnerd
yo Random!
Hi, Randomnerd. :)
Hi Randomnerd
Dken2021_: I don't go to clubs.
Randomnerd hi
Heya Randomnerd :)
hi Randomnerd
Whats going on here :)?
its still quiet?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=bqC25mklge4
Hi, AJIsAwesome , LadyCanary , Dken2021_ , Coldays, MaxTheBrony , and SafariMonkey
LunasGuard: You know that's old, right?
old as molasses
Hi Randomnerd
Okay, AJIsAwesome , what year are you?
:p it seemed fake
AJIsAwesome: though was funny thats all
:P
Randomnerd: In college.
*?
You could always try putting up a sign looking for people with a common interest.
LunasGuard: I can understand that.
I made most of my college friends after responding to a guy looking for D&D players.
thats awesome :)
Bronys made it to Springer?
yea, it's been out like for awhile now
Coldays: unfortunetley
oh so that was the cause :/
i guess i havent seen it until now and yes that is a little unfortunet
^
hi Blako
yepp
AJIsAwesome: their not really bronies nor paid actors
true
hi
They know about the show, but probably little about it.
actually, the supposed "actors" had a video stating they weren't
but they only got the show from the rage mail we were giving
>Woman says she's cosplaying as RD
guy is pinkie pie
>Clearly has a horn on her head
genius ^^
or modern art :P
she says that was so the producers wouldn't raise an eye because of a copyrighted character
xD
Pure Genius
Still, it's not cool to imiate something you're not.
morning
Hi, taoumi. :)
hai taoumi
evening taoumi
Heya taoumi
to be honest iv never cosplayed or even went to brony con before
ditto
Same.
I'd like to go to bronycon
Same
con #11 for me this weekend
^^
taoumi: hey there
Id like to find somone like me in sweden tho :p
its boring to go alone to such
yea i wanted to go but not enuff mony at the time for a rode trip
hallo Bronysith
I hope to either go to FiestaEquestria or Bronycon.
one or both
if i did i'd cosplay as a changeling
Fiestaequestria? lol
taoumi: you coming to atlanta for momocon?
there's not that many cons around where I live sadly
same
Same here.
im so glad Atlanta gets Dragoncon
OMG IT IS SO AWESOME
Lucky you. :D
:D Bronysith i don't have that kind of money. my one con where i buy something other then ticket and swag(maybe) is dragoncon
Does the professor actually mention in class about you?
what did you do with your time there Bronysith
taoumi: at least ill see you at dragoncon again next year
Yeah he picks on me all the time
Dken2021_: same here
Coldays: everything
sucks..
he doesn't forget anything
I am going to try my hardest to go to B.U.C.K this year, but I am only 16 and will have to find some excuse to go to where ever on my own :(
Whens the class over?
Like I took a horsemanship class freshman year just for fun and he found out about it
awwww lucky Bast*
next con I go to is in December..
and now he thinks I'm obsessed with horses
wow
and even made a reference to it in the meeting just now
Colt_Brovakiin: Same.
Last con I went to was NYCC
i'll try and make it Bronysith . my north carolina firends might not all be going considering soem of them are joining the army :/
Had so much fun \:3/
How was it?
taoumi: how goes the luna plushie making?
Still waiting for my shoot pictures though.
LadyCanary, didnt you go as Parasoul?
taoumi: and friends joining the military? i know that feel
Unfortunately no WallDives. A lot of work had to be done.
I see.
So I went as my fixed up Black Canary and Juliet Starling
i bought the frabric and the thread to put togeather the blank yesterday. but i kinda had home work Bronysith. i also have c++ that is due today...sooo i kinda wana finish that first :/
LadyCanary: so glad you had fun at comic con, i need to figure out how to get there some time
/me 13sneaks up behind canary and pounces <3
Shizu <3
Ohai Shizuka
:(
taoumi: again, no rush :D gives me more time to raise money
hi Shizuka
Hi, Shizu. :)
because he seems to be so caught up in a single useless language.
Hello Shizuka! Help us make Canary less sad :)
also he needs ponies so it is required that you put ponies on his desk.
XD
is Canary sad D:?
i dont remember LadyCanary saying shes sad.. question mark?
If that professor found out she likes ponies shed have bigger problems
I don't think she wants to talk about it.
^
It would only confirm his strange idea that I have a horse obsession
allright.
id ask him why he likes a language that doesn't scale.
understandable :)
Il hope she'll feel better :)
thats why twitter had tonnes of downtime when it was growing because its hard to scale ruby on rails.
^
hi Jmo
Hayo Invi
Heya Jmo :)
Max.
Xam.
wtf
wow Breaking Bad is pretty good
:)
I STILL need to watch that show. :D
me too
you should, it's awesoem
I think he just jumped on it because it was the newest bandwagon a couple years ago or something
thats true
especially aaron paul
it was a fad, a big deal and people thought it was going to be the next biggest thing
i love the main character
he was in Malcolm in the Middle
and it wasnt right?
twitter is even moving away from ruby on rails
because it is hard to scale and resource intensive.
everything I'm hearing says it was only a fad and only the fanboys are clinging on to it
yea, which was surprising to me since he was so comical in that one
such as my professor
I just got the internet explorer on my xbox :)
lol I just found a Soul eater (anime) Lyra ^^
ruby on rails tries to be easy to use, but at the expense of using much more cpu to process shitty code.
LunasGuard is it as stable as the PC version?
even when I'm running it locally it's sooo slow
And I don't even find it easy to use
I think all the conventions and crap are confusing
I prefer messy php to slow ruby any day.
sadly u need flash for bronystate
You could use IRIS, too.
it complains if you make a slight mistake in how it wants you to name something
i like Soul Eater its a good anime
at least php has a decade of support and stability behind it.
^
Its awesome :)
hilarious
Too bad the anime's over.
yeah :s
it doesn't come with flash? that's lame
yep, they force naming conventions on you to make your code look beter
yea
better
The manga's still going on, just not the anime.
Anyone got any tips on simillar animes like Soul eater?
what just happend?
MaxTheBrony: you mean hot blooded anime?
yeah
Dken2021_: it seems to work really considering I have just a controller
Lots of fun shit and epic battles :)
what is the class for anyways? is it a web dev course?
MaxTheBrony: check out gurren lagann
MaxTheBrony: your blood will boil after watching gurren lagann
Bronysith: I will thanks :)
Oh its this :D
I saw like 5 episodes then i forgot then name
but its awesome!
ohh shiz Gurren Lagann
dat good show
yea, that one's ok, though I like the second half more
Oh you know any on going series?
I hate catching up and then its done :s
One Piece?
Bleach?
HELL NO
Bleach sucks
fairy tail
BALLS
/me stabs Colday in the back as his way of saying he has returned
what i thought we were done with that
Dam you Socks
it's "Systems Development"
:P
:D
It didn't even have to be web; the professor just wanted to use rails
bleach is done isnt it?
They just ended like that..
nop
oh..... that project isn't due till the 28th.... well that's nice to know
its dragon ball z with swords
IS bleach done, if so It may be time for me to start watching it
oh they did finally?
Bronysith, you say that like it's a bad thing!
It's not.
nope Socks it is not
You wish it was finished.
Aww :(
its on break?
I would prefer to watch a show that I know has an end
geez, bleach must be going for the record of longest running anime of all time
the manga is stil lchuging along at 512 Socks
epi 366
Oops
O.O wow
actualy one piece hold that record i belive
but i don't minds it's hiarious
oh yea, forgot that one is also going too
SOCKS ARE COOL!
I started watching One Piece, I got to episode 175
Oh i havent watched Onepiece
:P
I have to go to work, bbl
SO R PANDAS!
one piece is good
Im so picky :s
though
I LOVE One Piece. :D
it just very very boring
meh
i gave up watching one piece. i read it now insted
one piece has been going on way too long
Panda: I can understand that.
One Piece is really good, I need to get back into it.
Anyone know a show that have the Animation quality equall to FMA: Brotherhood?
At least it has an ending planned out,
*.
Cause Fma:Bh had awesome animations
are they still searching for gold roger's treasure or they doing somethi9ng different
?
one piece is one of those things like bleach and naruto that need to just end and not get strung out... though im sure my gf would kill me for saying that >.>
I still need to finish FMA.
^ same
AJIsAwesome FINISH NOW~! ITS SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
Panda: Yeah, I can understand.
YOU HAVENT FINISHED FMA?!
Nope.
i stop watching one piece because i forgot were i left off at
Neither have I
Fma is amazing!
Watch it
Panda, your gf is a One Piece fanß ^^
Love the Intro also!
LunasGuard I got that a couple of times
Invi oh god yes >.>
Still better than naruto
Yui- Again , best intro song Imo
friggin naruto
i still dont know were i left off at
AJIsAwesome. make sure you watch brotherhood and not the origional...
:P
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 17 days, 20 hours, 21 minutes, 11 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
?
Why not?
Panda, lol are they already off the fishmen island? ^^
Invi: Yeah, I think so.
Invi i stopped after the fight with the CP9 and the introduction of the big 10
my god people
I'm still on the Sabaody arc, myself.
or what ever they are called
naruto wasn't that bad.....well then again, I left off when they when sasuke's brother was introduced
stop doing the cd shit, season 3 will get here sooner than you think
:P
I'm on the one where they meet god... I think :P
On what anime?
fma?
I would've loved it if they kept the characters young in Naruto.
Panda, last thing i saw was how they went to the fishmen island ^^
One piece
But I lost all interest in Naruto when Shippuden came out.
AJIsAwesome: I actually like seing the characters grow up :)
the only reason i watch naruto was for lee, and now that he has his own spinoff show there is no reason to watch or read naruto at all
Socks, you mean enel?
AJIsAwesome did sakura ever get useful after the timeskip?
So you're up to episode 175? That's the oddly awkward part of One Piece, where the filler arc after this is going to be better than the actual canon arc you're watching now.
Yes that's the bunny
buny?
AJIsAwesome, well for me... its just getting good, well where the manga is... it was very very boring before hand.
In fact, because they were kids it seemed pretty inspirational to see them become powerful and developed shinobi.
*binny
*bunny
Dken2021_: Yeah, she did.
wait Kandarihu whithc one was that. the dragon island arc?
taoumi, Skypiea
naruto would be a good show... if the characters wouldnt use up 95% of the episode talking bullshit
skypiea is cannon Kandarihu
they sut never shut up
I loved the Skypiea saga. :D
man, sakura was like the most useless character in that show
^
still is
I love naruto for Kakashi xD
My favorite so far probably has to be the CP9 saga, though.
haha
wait
MaxTheBrony oh hehe, well... you know what he did right?
hahaha
Either that or Impel Down.
/me love naruto for naruto
Panda: Yepp :D
taoumi, I know. And this is the part when it gets slow. It's because at this point in the manga, Oda was rewriting how a major plot point in the future plays out.
MaxTheBrony O_O you read the new chapter?
Panda: Ofcourse >; D
I loved it
!
I found it dragged, (ha one piece drag never) so I stopped watching on skypiea, intend to go back though
MaxTheBrony... poor rin ;A;
Panda: yeah but why did kak do it? i didnt understand
D:
good evening bronystate :)
hey, knwo what would be cool right now? if a mod would heroicly crash into the chat and stream something
Heya DaringDerpy !

hrm
Invi: not in europe

And once again I return
Dark_Horst, well some are, some not
Cant wait for next chapter !:)

in europe it's that boring time of 9 pm during the week
Which is not the only time I have died today...
Suprisingly

/me fetches a spade for Socks
11,02hai ^-^
Hallo
/me digs self grave
sakura related
ello Jake
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU
hi NewSuperBronyU :)
Socks, it's worth it to get through it, even if you have to force yourself. It gets back to constantly getting better for the most part after this.
MaxTheBrony, it comes out tonight or tomorrow morning btw
Gah, stupid internet.
ello NewSuperBronyU
/me hugs Bronysith back :)
Panda: Oh O.o
ohai NewSuperBronyU :3
Panda: Thanks for reminding me
@Kandarihu: will attempt to do!
Damn that didn't work
:D
with out @
MaxTheBrony ^^ np, I just want it to hurry up and end though -__-
/me is new and still learning things
im back and still no stream6_9
welcome to the herd, Socks :)
/me gives Socks the /me achievment
WOO!
ok going ot read my book today. and write the prigram tomarow
taoumi, up to the point where Socks got up to, the longest filler arc was 7.5 episodes long.
:)
I liked Oz
sign of a good anime Kandarihu *cough* naruto */cough*
Socks: You know if you Write first letters of a chatters name and press TABB you will automaticly write the whole name
O.O woah! Science fiction!
yepp yepp
Let me try that...
Neato
Well, the filler after Skypiea is 11.5 episodes long, but like I said earlier, it outshines the canon stuff.
:D
/me stabs Coldays
NOOOOO
WOW It works!
/me Tackles Socks
/me use Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation to sommon Coldays
Bronysith: got a pic :D ? of your friend ^^

/me finishes transformation
/me obtains some Materia
omg thats epic xD
SB >.>
/me licks SB
Coldays and chew bubblegum! and I'm all out of gum!
There's a 10 episode filler arc a while after that, but besides that, yes. The fillers are very sporadic. It's probably because the episodes are padded to fill out the full 21 minutes that they have.
Aha! I see my sheild in that picture!
ha no sheild no decapitation
/me punches Coldays
I only have a Sword
:P
ouff dam you 3rd person speach

Burnout paradise (What is being played) is good

agreed
LunasGuard: realistic or overtuned?

XAX, I believe it's Burnout New Paradise. Not sure, though
Ohai XAX :)
Jake: dont really matter just really good

LunasGuard: mhh maybe NFS:SHIFT
XAX: Shizuka playing Burnout Paradise City

Reacclimating to the handling

LunasGuard: but a lot of the newer NFS games are awful
after those the series downhilled too much

This reminds me of Burnout...
back when rock had power...not emo bullshit, but raw power
OH YEAH
Old Metal Van!
Jake: never played Blur
A-TEAM
Nice van maaaaaan

O.o

Oh ye gods I hate and love that song :D
artist: hey WAT THE HELL MAN?!
ONWARDS
Now back to some good old chaos and anarchy.
sha
It's like call me maybe I can't not love it!
When the word "oops" comes up before you've seen the reason why it's usually grounds to pre-emptive cringe.
what was that?
chaos creates content
Kandarihu: Avril has been known to cause bouts of spontaneous murder frenzy.
THIS VAN IS ROCKING
this is different. what game we watching? And afternoon, everypony :)
away to JCII
Shizuka SMASH!

Hi, Sylandest. :)
bye jake
LunasGuard: *shrugs*
SHIZUSMASH TIME
Ohai again Sylandest :P
If you have to ask if you just got trolled then you just got trolled without them even having to try and troll you.
this game makes me want to drive a semi into oncoming trafic
howdy AJIsAwesome and Colt_Brovakiin once more
dat artist chat name
BURNOUT VAN WINS
Oh that's just fancy driving there shizumobile :D
/me is on the hunt for artist
Sure, distract her. That'll help.

LAWL

That pole
DAAAAAAMMMMM!
What's that van? Kill them all? Good idea!
which part of nfs is this? I have the urge to download it immediately
I suck at driving games at the best of times but first person seems abominable to use.
Wbat if we take this van and push it over THERE!
this looks like fun
THIS IS BLOODY MAYHEM
It's not all that bloody so far.
:)
Though I can't imagine how many people got reduced to pulp during the crashes.

GO SHIZU GO
NOT THAT BROKE
OHH
Well, she won. Does it matter?
I WANNA ROCK
Shizu wanna ROCK!
front motor cars need a slight kick in the rear
No not really.
physics do the rest
Kandarihu: experience and objectives...?
I WANNA EAT!
This NEEDS to be increased in VOLUME!
ROCK!
/me cranks up the Volume
What's the objective if you've already cleared the objective?
So much METAL :D
literaly
MadSurge, her objective is to kill 38 cars, and she pulled it off.
Vordox: is that a pun
Kandarihu: yeah, I see
LunasGuard: ...Derp XD
GO GO NO NO NO!
Everything else is just bonus points.
yea she's a t 50 now so she win?
Coldays: now it's just for fun!
SHIZU WANNA ROCK!
next challenge
/me headbangs.
so its safe to say Shizu gives no bucks?
lol agreed this looks like fun
Sylandest: She gives no heed for weak pansies.
<--- Proof

Derp.
Vordox: XD
Rock
WHOA
Rock
IM A GOOFYGOOBER
Too much rock XD
GUITAR SOLO GO!
She's playing around with that rear-view button
Is this really that exciting or is chat at the moment just too easily amused?
Meanwhile: are you one of those that want no spoilers for season 3?
Rock ROCK I wanna ROCk rock rock rock I WANT TO ROCK!
im certainly enjoying this
Bravo shizumobile !
MadSurge ALL s3 spoilers are bannable
MadSurge: Don't really care. But it's not allowed in chat anyway.
Chrysalis: not even in PMs?
/me standing ovations.
:p
whats going on?
pms are fine
meanwhile......in paradise city
LunasGuard: XD
lol
Hai alexxm
/me in Paradise City where the grass is green and the girls are pretty...
hey guys and how are things Vordox
hi Alexxm
Ohai alexxm :)
alexxm: Having some AWeSOME fun in Burnout :D
MadSurge, Chrysalis, only if the recipient doesn't mind the spoilers. Keep in mind that this is still a spoiler sancutary.
Hi, alexxm. :)
Meanwhile: look out raining metal
how've you guys been Coldays Colt_Brovakiin and AJIsAwesome
hi alexxm :)
Well, I think I'd better be heading bedwards...
And rocking out!
this is Shizuka at Crash- brony FM
how've you been DaringDerpy
Hey, alexxm
THis has been fun
Bye Socks :)
Bye guys
nice
derp
nite Socks
realy good no stream till like 20 min's ago but good all the same
everything as planned at the moment, alexxm...great :)
BYe, Socks :)
/me stabs Coldays for old times sake
That classical music XD
you?
:)
I wouldn't suppose there's any way to cause the game to play custom music in this game, is there?
Quality's better than yesterday.
I love how the van has a constant kickback, lol
Noo bye socks
:P
There, I'm done Chrysalis. And I've been very vague to Meanwhile :D
Kandarihu: Should be doable
Speed limit? what speed limit?
^
Meanwhile: with a van? What Van?
this music fits
THIS MUST BE GERMANY
the Vague has been dubbled
What are these 'rules of the road' you speak of?
I mean, if there was a way for Shizu to have her modplug music channeled into the game as she smashes up cars, that would be an oddly amazing juxtaposition there.
MadSurge: has of the german autobahn has speed limits or construction sites....and careless driving gets punished everywhere...but yes...at night, when the traffic density is low...yay :)
dose she have to pay for gas
-has +half
Weneed music, by EA
Bye guys :s gotta go do some french studying...
Au revóir.
buffer
DaringDerpy: I know noone would drive like this IRL, but :D
MaxTheBrony: wish you success
later MaxTheBrony
Bye, MaxTheBrony. :)
you like smashing other cars don't you Shizuka
MaxTheBrony: Go learn fancy! :D
DAT JANE'S ADDICTION
Awww, the music isn't high enough. :(
<3
It's kind of the point of the game.
:) merci mes amis! Au Revóir!
STOP AND NOW GO.
Meanwhile: murder with cars?
Mm.
<3
autobahn is best with a motorcycle
my god breaking bad wtf
no murder just wrecking
DaringDerpy: best way to die
Thank you Shizu
if you want to take the risk, Bronysith
Bonk.
lul
Smart AI is Smart
le wild wall appeared
Holla everypony! :)
oh god breaking bad you are breaking my heart
Hi, GilDash. :)
'Lo GilDash.
hoi GilDash
burnout
hi GilDash
Bronysith: it's a honorless death, imo...you risk to involve other people, who just want to get home
Heya GilDash :)
Does anypony know why DJ Atomica is referring to Burnout Elite as a "noble order of drivers"?
hai twilight_sprinkle
GilDash! Hiiiii
hei Invi :)
Kandarihu: Because he's buzzed off his head?
is this burnout paradise
hi Twilight_Sprinkle
ohai Coldays
Oh come on...
so many wrecks:D
That was unlucky.
so many retards on the internet
Hello everypony! I loves tacos, and I am NOT a retard for once.
Hi, VenHur. :)
i am!
Heya VenHur :)
Hi VenHur
hi VenHur
hoi VenHur
Welp.
hi VenHur
how are things VenHur
'Lo VenHur.
i am too but dont use the R Word\
Blaaaaaaaah
VenHur: Holla you non-retarded taco loving person!
vertically!
Those railings are surprisingly robust.
Shizuka: this vehicle has brakes too
Don't be silly, brakes are silly.
So, what're we watching?
Who uses breaks?
What are breaks
Kitkats?
I prefer Twixes, but thanks anyway.
good show tonight
twix ftw
kitkats are so delicious
so crispy and chocoloatelyeafdioaduf
Is it buffering a lot all of a sudden or is it just me?
true who dose use breaks i just let whatever i crash into stop me
I never liked kitkats. :D
Meanwhile: i see some buffer too
I get some occasional buffer.
kitkats are good too, but they so blatalntly ripped of the break thing
But Twixes has that irristable layer of caramel...
/me can't find a speed meter
but you cant compare twixes to kit kats
Guess the connections gotten fuzzy on one end.
Just did.
this is at least 250 km/h...more to 300
ouchie
both vans
<--. Women drivers. :P
we need more death in chat
lol
nah, this seems slower than 250 km/h
Vordox: asian women drivers
I have this song somewhere...
Bronysith: You do know women drives not as fast as men ? :P
the LOL has been Dubbled
Vordox: id rather deal with slow drivers than fast drivers
Shizu is ONE hell of a driver from the looks of it
/me likes an active chat
Reaction times like a god(ess)
I (would) drive about 3 miles a hour
Vordox: You say that and boom, walled.
bus ^^
Meanwhile: XD
Vordox: You're bad luck.
Meanwhile: walled?
the road is scary >>
hehe
JUST A COINCIDENCE
Ack
shizumobile: stop dieing
Bronysith: It's not death :
:P
wow
that was a neat death
These games always were good for car acrobatics.
HOOPPPPY SHIT
like ragdoll only with cars
Shizu likes her jumps
hey
she crash win
"YOU LOST scene " "You win" "Woot"
great success!
fucking junkies
Breaking bad is too damn dark
XD
No one cares about Breaking Bad.
At all.
I don't even know what it is.
breaking bad is a thing now?
Find a Breaking Bad chatroom if talking about it is that important.
Meanwhile: meth trade
Meanwhile: It's got Hal in it! ... And that's literally all I know. XD
^
Dat car <3
Breaking bad = Sounds like farts
hi
hi Cades
barrel rolls
OH SHIT
It's the MAYHEM ONE
Ah no it's not :P
And I thought the van was a bit speedy.
That insane target score...
no chance
How the hell are you supposed to reach that?
Driving around a lot?
Give her time. =3
with combosalotsa combos without dying
Hate the stunt runs.....
Clonk.
fali
ignore my horribru typing
She was only 70k away
i failed at spelling fail
dat dj
Now I understand. Even though she clears the requirements for an event, it doesn't end until her time runs out. Sorry for not understanding before
I like that there are no pedestrians whatsoever.
on the highway?
Kandarihu: So spoiled gamers :P
Anywhere.
where I live, they get fined when there
fun game btw
Presumably in the kind of society that lets drivers do this all over the main road everyone has just learned to stay indoors.
Courier services must be lucrative.
censors would have a party on this game with pedestrians
and thats why most racing games have no pedristrians
they had to replace pdestrians with zombies
Meanwhile, everyone?
cause zombies have no feelings
Kandarihu: Mm. It's like if the world was comprised of the average person in this chat. :P
Meanwhile, oh that's not very nice. lol
i like da way you think <Meanwhile
Surely someone would do something about a bright pink vehicle doing a rediculous amount of damage?
oight alexxm?
this society were full of complaints, politicians, lawyers and people shooting each other out of frustration
i'm good SafariMonkey you?
good thanks alexxm
you have a bad perception of the people, Meanwhile
:)
Can you blame me?
Look at you.
bad...imagination...don't know the fitting word
Kandarihu: in this game you mean?
WHAT
they are replacing the people with zombies
WTF
twilight_sprinkle, yes. This game.
00,10I have to say this is looking real clean Shizuka
Zombie drivers
half the fun was killing the innocents
Kandarihu: lol thatd be an interesting twist
:P
Sumica: indeed! Also, hi :D
AND it would justify DJ Atomica declaring the Burnout Elite to be a "noble order of drivers"
Sumica: It damn well is
Crunk.
Ow...
I thought Paradise City was from Appetite for Destruction, not 'Greatest Hits'? :S
all these cars are driven by baby ponies
Spaloosh.
Lucky Shizu there
That was dumb
Kahrenk.
00,10ouch
Ouch...
wall 1 shizu 0
I think by now the wall is on like, 7.
Mental note: Walls are stronger then you are.
Or your car.
Shizu cannot win against the walls, NOONE can
/me runs into Sumica s shins with a bull dozer
lag
GilDash: unless you're the Hulk.
GilHULK
MadSurge: Well yes, but the Hulk doesn't really need to drive now, does he?
GilDash: nope :D
no he jumps
*Boing!*
like a Boss
My wall sense is tingling
lol
How's stuff GilDash? :)
MadSurge: Same old, same old. Yourself? :)
bang
20 seconds prediction, not bad XD
Wall sense tingling about now... *Starts counting*
13moment
Walls are our greatest defense against the zerg.
You're predicting someone is going to crash in a game where the objective is to crash into cars. Of course it's going to happen eventually. XD
00,10I think out of all of them I liked revenge the most
lolzerg
lol nice
tap boom
13phone call ><
lol nop, no walls
My prediction!
GilDash: I have a stuffed ear ( water from the pool) but I'm fine too!
Di-doop.
("anonymous" has only got two n's though)
MadSurge: I always shake my head really hard when I get out just to make sure that doesn't happen.
Btw I'm on my way to the post office to ship your Rainbow Dash :)
Monty python intermission plz
Hi everypony!
yay :)
ello Dark92Enigma
and Hello Shizuka!
Hi, Dark92Enigma! :)
'Lo Dark92Enigma.
Dark92Enigma: Holla! :)
also thanks fixing mistake
her look is slightly disturbing
GilDash: glad you like swimming too :)
oh Sumica hi
/me is eating a orange
hi Dark92Enigma :)
00,10ohhi
an*
MadSurge: I do, I just don't do much anymore. :S
hi GilDash :)
Sumica: whats going on?
DaringDerpy: not for me....
13sorry bout that
and Dark92Enigma hi
erm...ok
13back to the road rage
DaringDerpy: Holla! :)
No problem, Shizu. :)
road rage ouo~
GilDash: I restarted recently, just to get some muscular tone again :P
yes back to deh driving class
and yeah c: It's all good
The road is angry. Sacrifice some cement to appease it.
^
I hate captchas so i think my custom spam solution will prevent mostly everything without annoying users.
burnout best game to play when u piss at someone
MadSurge: Now it's winter here, which means rain everyday so I can't walk/run, I should probably get membership. And kettlebelling.
And some cars too
Aaaah
00,10not much, just realazing a bit before day 7 of work

I stopped watching after Shippuden came out.
I stopped watching after naruto got the headband

Nothing random about it. It makes perfect sense.

Hi, cachi01. :)
hi cachi01!
paradise city stream? yay
cachi01: Why the long face? :p
Hi cachi01
GilDash: that was a typo mistake lol
and you pony_295501
cachi01: I know, just thought I'd make a lame joke out of it. :D
Coldays: dat was me lol
I miss Interplay
omg
btw anypony else has problems with the chat embed?
interplay made the original fallout, and my god it was awesome
the cachi01 has been dubbled
Didn't we have an Interplay reminiscence only a few days ago?
the ability to kill anyone
glorious
kill anyone? yay
but of course there were consequences
indeed id start with Socks
you could kill Main quest givers
you could side with the main enemies
Coldays: But Socks are good! They make ponies look sexy. ;)
awesome
target them in your sights and you could kill them
even children
those bastards trying to steal my caps
AWESOME
Could you stop adventuring and open a shop?
/me opens a shop of eggplants ontop of Meanwhile
yes not those Socks im talking about the brony Socks muahahahaha
Coldays: Bronies... with ponies... oh my. ;)
so chat is now PG 13+?
13you know... take any RPG where you go through dungeons... you amass a huge pile of valuable stuff
that's a long phonecal
13why sell it to a merchant? you should be able to open your own shop
Exactly.
yea
Shizuka: is there any problem with the chat embed? it wont load for me
Shizuka: finally someone with sense
i usually just hoard it
But no. Sadly no one in fiction-world-of-the-moment sells land.
Probably because there's not as many crazy PC types in the world who would last as long as you?
Shizuka: could you kill anyone in baldurs gate as well?
if my fallout home would be sized realisticly according to the stuff i have in it.... i'd be living in a warehouse
13yes but you had a reputation score
did they just glue that guys head to a turtle?
Shizuka: so like fallout
13if it fell too low you'd get guards ambushing you pretty much all the time
13AH SURVE THE FLAMING FIST
Shizuka: thats why i play lawful good

oh boy!
NOSTALGIA CRITIC AND RIFFTRAX!
Well, I spose I've been meaning to see Lion King at some point and the riff probably isn't going to distract from that much.
NOW this should be really good.
13also do you guys see the usual controls at the bottom or are those gone with this method
I think the review is..............BATMAN FOREVER
Lion King doesnt deserve to be riffed
shiningdawn: gone
They're gone.
And, never seen anything by the Nostalgia Critic but since the whole internet is clambering to suck him off he must be doing something right.
Dark92Enigma: NC that's nc?
whoops
oh, rifftrax by NC, this might actually be funny
damn you tab
11,01Why is the movie taking up 1/4 of the screen?
do you mean that TGWTG tried to boost popularity with this?
Dark_Horst: yes!
Meanwhile: YMMV
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
okay. i recognized him when he got louder xD
also yeah 1/4 of the stream screen is displayed
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.......This movie roooooooooocks..........you got well paid

Bronysith: IIRC Nostalgia Critic likes the movie, but he thinks it's overrated
too bad that africa dont look like for real :(
since we're watching a Disney movie, what was the first Disney movie you guys saw?
Bambi
FlutterMEDIC: THIS ONE <---
No idea.
I like Lion King (as a classic movie), but I really don't see its massive hype.
XD
FlutterMEDIC, very good question
*cough cough* Long time no see everypony!
Hercules probably.
I laughed at the death scene
can't really answer with a blurred memory
my first Disney movie was Tarzan

FlutterMEDIC, AAAAAAAAAAW SHIIIIIT <3
AJIsAwesome: I guess it's because it's a BIG movie....i mean look at the scenery, the background animation is amazing

Sketch_Toku_Brony: I've never seen that before. Didn't even know they were in the game.

Dark92Enigma, is it because it's a villain song?
*howly shi! who is streaming this? and who do i need to give bacon too for doing it?
Did you guys that in hyenas society it's females that rule?
I'm sure this'd be better if there was no riff.
<--- There, new voice. :P
... please tell me we wont get too many Nazi jokes here -.-
cachi01: How is it even slightly cannibalism?
CrimsonPhoenix: they're always a masterpiece
Shizuka: believe it or not when the scene goes red someone completly takes over the singing
The curse of not seeing the movie alone beforehand.
Meanwhile: yeah it is
Lyra|atwork: shizuka deserves you bacon

Lyra|atwork, what's your first?
Lyra|atwork: what's your first then? :)
13disney songs usually have kind of a big build at the end so it masks the voice switch pretty well
Now watch. Lion king is going to be put on this weeks survey liek a million times.

Well fraud can and does happen. But it will only make a difference in states that are pretty much split 50/50 or in low population states.
fluttercry, Obama's proxies can fake a lot. And it doesn't take much to sway the election in battleground states.

thus the quotes
oni_link: where she never dies, and kills everything?
indeed
how the hell did she survive that?
oni_link: ok, fun
that sounds like a hard difficulty
Dark_Horst: god mode
EG: beast mode
05,15When do the aliens show up?
fluttercry: some time
fluttercry: quite some time later, i think
Kinda creepy but OHMYGASH http://fav.me/d5iuiwk
whooooooooo
CrimsonPhoenix: how is that creepy?
05,15This game was like FarCry...but good
^
lol
cowvarkian, the face formation...maybe the muzzle
i liekd far cry. it was fun enough
I dunno, I don't think it's creepy
CrimsonPhoenix: ok then...
FarCry is hilarious, all th bugs :D
only that though
cryisis is just amazing
05,15Farcry always looked pretty and had awesome ideas, but never could make the game fun enough
awesome engine too
05,15Farcry 2 was a trainwreck
I was gonna ask that, is Farcry 3 worth it?
I'm just creeped in general but still the technics are there and it's still an amazing piece
oni_link: looks like it....idk
middle class pc could run it on a relatively high setting with now problem at all
05,15Maximum Dpeed!
05,15Speed*
and even the low settings just looked GOO
D
Dark_Horst: or goo
no
Dark_Horst: not goo?
not go
and also not goo
and they dont see the laser on your gun
:P
05,15Most of my time in Farcry 2 was spent running over zebras
Major: its magic
I definitely want to pick up Crysis 3, they are going back to having PC melting sys reqs and an open envrionment
must be easy mode. otherwise, she would be dead now
fluttercry: seems legit
cant blame her
05,15Dark_Horst there are cheats
Dark_Horst: its god mode
crysis on hardmode euqlas deathwish
http://fav.me/d5ip72g that "someone watches movie night" feeling...
oh

well, that explains it
Dem Koreans
05,15Cheating on PC games is so much fun
Koreans are cool
I agree fluttercry
has there been a Brony convention in Texas?
only in gta
05,15Yes
gta was MADE for cheats
like Brony fan-fair or something
05,15Brony Fan Fair yes
WHO KOREAN UP IN DIS PIECE? \ |8O /
there really needs to be a brony convention in Minnesota
also loved how you actually had to GRAB the ammo
05,15bewm
well there's ANOTHER convention that is set in 2013 and it isn't Brony fan-fair
05,15TWO PISTOLS

also, have you guys heard of the new F2P game Crytek is making?
soo much grenade

/me rubs up against Meanwhile
oohp oohp oohp oohp open gangnam style
cya Dark9 Y U LEAVE SO FAST
oni_link, it's hardly shock if they were able to shoot him first
Well, he has to be careful not to do anything that would compel his captor to tighten his grip. The discipline of a man growing up in the most repressive dictatorship in the world is not to be underestimated.
oohp oohp oohp oohp open gangnam style
well I know Id be scared
their necks seems to be their one weakness

I thought it was oppan o_o
I actually get annoyed with the pony toy commercials now, is that weird?
Dark_Horst: and idk what todays shooters youre playing, but in games like counter-strikes source the ai was very clever
oni_link: I can understand that.
cuteness_kitteh: yeah the n didnt showed idk why
the heck, shooting rocks?
cachi01: Seems legit.
ohai everypony :)
twilight_sprinkle: played that too. also i played it mp only
pings errywhere :3
Dark_Horst: well im referring to the sp ai
since the bots werent really challenging enough for my taste
how did it catch fire
ugh the Jonah wedding... Why does anyone care?
*Jonas
Dark_Horst: counter strike is mp only
Dark_Horst: lol have you played on very hard vs the bots? theyre more than a chellenge then
oni_link there was a wedding?
so a few bullets take out the whole tire then
oni_link: the what?
oni_link, the who what now?
cachi01: it has bots
cachi01: its not
well i mean
it doesnt have a sp campaign mode
oni_link: What in the name of the what the what the what?
cachi01: no campaign
Oh, this game.
So much silliness.
Eat mah boolets!

ohai Randomnerd :)
cachi01: maybe cs:go has, but im talking about source
oni_link, some people actually care about the Jonas Brothers. Not that anyone who doesn't should, of course.
twilight_sprinkle: nope cs:go sucks
one of the Jonas brothers is engaged and they have a show dedicated to the time in between the actual wedding...
Hey, thelonepony
00,10so much lag on my end
05,15CS:GO was fun for 2 weeks

RDash5000: I know, right?
boom
I envy those of you who dont know, really
i saw cs:go, dont see much of a difference from cs:source
source is baws
AJIsAwesome: I wish there was more steampunk pictures
twilight_sprinkle: To be fair there are a huge number of physics-enabled objects compared to a lot of games of the time
twilight_sprinkle: updated graphics thats all
thelonepony: Same.
twilight_sprinkle: and new game modes
I don't watch that stuff. Booooring!
twilight_sprinkle: I bought CS:GO because it was cheaper atm and now I have insta-regret
Safari|webchat: where?
well play with your yarn then cuteness_kitteh :3
twilight_sprinkle: In crysis
oni_link: cheaper than cs:source?
thelonepony: That I will do.
05,15Most of my game time has been on XCOM, The Walking Dead, and Sleeping Dogs lately

twilight_sprinkle: OK, so it's not a huge advancement on a well-respected physics engine that came a few years before. Does that mean it's bad, or just OK?

Scootaway what a perfectly unique way of using Xs

Speaking of gamertags, have you ever noticed that anyone with "ninja" in their gamertag is the least stealthy person on the planet?
hole
Petrified_Discord: IKR
oni_link: i had a friend whose tag was KronicBlunts420
random hole
lol
twilight_sprinkle: The gas canister wagons? or what?
oni_link: sadly he's not with us anymore..
god all of this game looks frekin impressive
05,15Gh0575n1p3r
Scootaway, whenever I see that kind of user with the "@" in it, I think of email. O_o
xXcAchiXx <--- my gamertag
Dken2021: it's Crysis, it was the PC killer, watch Yahtzee's review of it
There are two dominant ideas of what ninjas are. The realistic ninja and the fantasatic ninja.
god mode ftw!
Sn1p3r El1te
Dken2021: It's 5 years old. :P
Safari|webchat: the ones with the pcs
Snoiper Elite
00,03>_>
otakon: sorry to hear that. I think its worse when they mod their consoles to use custom characters and they still have uncreative names like that...
Kandarihu: aren't realistic ninja just basically low rent samurai that are tricky?
twilight_sprinkle: Oh
Like epicponysauce@scootaway.com :D
05,15I knew a guy who's gamertag was "Bu77 B4ang3r"
........
fluttercry: hah
otakon: they're asassins. samurai are knights
00,03L.O.L.
fluttercry: lol
otakon: huge difference htere
wow
....No comment
thought that said bug banger
Dark_Horst: samurai are more drunk guys with swords
Realistic ninja were peasants fighting opressive regíme.
otakon, real ninjas are masters of stealth and were used as assassins and spies. Realistic ninjas at least hold to that.
Dark_Horst: no Ninja were honorless samurai didn't you know that?
Dken2021: I would get a copy, it's only like 10 dolars maybe?
*dollars
otakon: that's ronin.
05,15otakon ninja were peasant farmers
05,15Ronin were fallen samurai
Dark_Horst: seriously they were unscrupolous(sp_ samurai
Safari|webchat sweet, might get one sometime
Shizuka is OP
no Ronin were MASTERLESS Samurai
nerf plz
not the same thing
that'S new to me
Samurai? O-o
otakon: Seriously, you know nothing.
a fallen Samurai would usually kill themselves
05,15How do you think they got masterless?
i see
otakon, dont you know, that was ronin.
OK I better bed.
:P
night Safari|webchat
bye
NINJAS ARE PEOPLE THAT CAN CONTROL SHIT AND HAZ RASENGANS
night
Night Safari|webchat :)
05,15A lot of Ronin's were samurai that refused to kill themselves
i feel as though otakon doesnt know.
Lyra`: well yeah I guess
I DO KNOW DAMMIT
that ronin didnt kill themselves
might not be on for a couple weeks
^-^
or they left their masters service
bye
The thing is, ninjas would sometimes resort to deception to get away from a situation unscathed, and those tricks became legends in the eyes of those who survived a ninja encounter. These legends are the foundation of the fantastic ninja.
bye Safari|webchat
bye Safari|webchat take care
So he tried to run away from the frag, but you shot him back into it? Niiiiiice :)
i dont think otakon knows, that he had godly facial hair
bye Safari|webchat
05,15You guys remember that Deadliest Warrior show and how bad it was?
yup
nope
fluttercry: try not to
Lyra`: I'm still shaven
i do
00,03Ninja Warrior was MLG~
Hmmm, do cats drink Sprite...?
fluttercry: Yes.
holy geez
fluttercry, what? I loved Deadliest Warrior
fluttercry: it was fun though
they had a game about it
was pretty bad
bye twilight_sprinkle otakon FlutterMEDIC thelonepony oni_link :D
Scoot-Scootaloo: no
cuteness_kitteh, yes they do :D
BYe, Safari|webchat :)
05,15"We're going to test these two swords and see which is better, but we're not going to do the same test for both, so the scientific method is already wrong"
Scoot-Scootaloo: unless MLG means shitty now
Lyra ': Yay.
fluttercry, good point
fluttercry: so, its myth busters now?
And bye AJIsAwesome|Busy. :)
00,03cowvarkian: It goes both ways <_<
05,15"This gun is way more accurate BUT THIS ONE BLEW HIS HEAD OFF!"
fluttercry: yeah... at least R. Lee Ermy did that for the Katana and Broadsword. Katana won by the way
That show was AWFUL.
/me turns into a human and drinks Sprite
but it was FUN
Knight vs Pirate was a travesty.
otakon: no
CriticKitten: how so?
otakon: lawl the shitstorm on youtube that video caused
One word, otakon: blunderbuss
twilight_sprinkle: really?
otakon: you bet
Fires 33% of the time, OMG SO POWERFUL.
dat no colisions
katanas are moer MLG though
fail coding
05,15I liked Mail Call with R.Lee Ermy. It was so awesome
CriticKitten: Yay for kittens. ^_^
twilight_sprinkle: katanas for the win
05,15But yeah, their testing method was flawed
05,15You can have two tests to compare something and expect it to be correct
fluttercry: like myth busters?
^
fluttercry: But they ran the simulation 1000 tiems u guise! It HAS to be legit! Rite?
wat?
o.o
yeah PC simulations are NOT the same as physical ones
05,15Mythbusters used to be really good and they USED to do real science
it was still a fun show
what is it Kurra?
fluttercry: until what?
kaboom
otakon: until they didnt
05,15Petrified_Discord oh you mean the modified Rome Total War engine
really?
that is the high tech thing they used?
otakon: have you seen a revent mythbusters?
*recent
TF2 all the way. b o-o b
cowvarkian: no I haven't really
I'm hearing things about munitions and tests....
otakon: ok
idk how old that was, but all the mythbusters ive seen conists of so many compromises and pseudo-science thatn none of their results are credible
ohai DemoPegono :)
00,10but mythbusters got so much better when they started invloving the peole in the neighborhood.
hiya Sumica
DemoPegono: do also d o-o b
:D
Hello, the lonepony.
Sumica: thats hilarious
well maybe not none, but most
ohai sumi
twilight_sprinkle, yeah, but its fun
otakon: In that show, they demonstrated the blunderbuss as a complete crap shoot whose firing was dependent on roll of the die. And yet it managed to attain the pirate more kills than every other weapon combined, despite its extreme unreliability and mediocre-at-best penetration on plate armor.
00,10ohhi
Thumbs up is awesome. b o-o b
DemoPegono: you don't have to space my name :P
CriticKitten: ah so that's your issue with it
DemoPegono: okay please stop that
Pretty much forced to call bullshit on that show when that happens. :p
Why?
Phase4: it can be fun, but i dont like the confidence with which they claim their results, and hearing people say well mythbusters proved it wrong, so its wrong"
Oh
DemoPegono: I don't know, it's a bit aggravating is all
twilight_sprinkle: yeah
I see... it looks like boob...
yeah and that
Lol
also it can be considered spamming
... how?
I don't know ask the mods
otakon x DemoPegono
xd
just giving you a head's up
?
05,15because it's not contributing to conversation
stop shipping me!
otakon: never
00,03and otakon.. just stop.
otakon: but you ARE shipping
seriously I don't want to go to Abu Dahbi
And to think I was wanting Mythbusters to test EMPs and faraday cages. Just doing a whole bit on it, maybe even a whole episode.
a free otakon with every purchase
cowvarkian: lmao
Scoot-Scootaloo: what? what did I do? I asked him to stop bc it was aggravating me

You know what was their dumbest episode though?
cuming in hot
who be takin dem jerbs?
KABOOM!
Spartan vs Ninja.
05,15lol
And besides, the shipping is harrassment.
Greek Spartan vs Halo Spartan
Phoo. I have a lot of stuff to do... Bai everybody/kitty/pony
CriticKitten: ugh wouldn't the Spartan have won?
YAY violence!
beautiful explosions
cya cuteness_kitteh :)
bye cuteness_kitteh take care
05,15Spartan would own a ninja any day
I think Micheal Bay was here
Bye cuteness_kitteh :3
fluttercry: yeah pretty sure on armor and weapons alone
Helicopter's like "fuck this shit"
seeya cuteness_kitteh
otakon: nah. grass has'nt exploded yet
"Let's take a well-armored hoplite and pit it against a stealth-based fighter whose only advantage is the element of surprise. DURR HURR WHO WILL WIN"
Petrified_Discord: If the Mark VI is involved, the Greek Spartan is screwed
cachi01: oh yeah good point
05,15Which cut better with R.Lee. Ermy. Broadsword or Katana?
fluttercry: IIRC the katana, it CLEAVED through leather armor
fluttercry: while the broadsword struggled with it
05,15CriticKitten I'm convinced that show was created in a room full of stoned people
fluttercry: spoon
fluttercry: Which is why it's funny because the episode ended as a total beatdown. The Spartan DESTROYED the Ninja. And his best weapon? THE SHIELD.
well, katana Does cut better,its just that the broadsword is based more on power of the shot than cutting
so... the guys on this island have helecopters
05,15"W...what if a ninja fought a Spartan?"
fluttercry: it's a spike show, right
05,15DUUUUUDE
What's shipping?
Phase4: its' the NK military ofc
00,03sorry, was AFK~
That ally shold be saying Out instead of Over if he's not expecting a reply. :/
the airstrike was performed by normal jet craft
What if I exploded?
05,15cowvarkian yeah
Really.
Nittany_Discord: u always explode!
but suddenly they have these vtol's things that can airlift tanks
fluttercry: then it probably was
im back
/me , finest of hairsplitters.
DemoPegono, portraying a romantic relationship between two people.
YES. THE SHIELD was the Spartan's most effective weapon. Surprise surprise, it turns out when you hit people in the FACE with a hard metal plate, it hurts
/me 11,01explodes
Nittany_Discord: I'd have to sweep you up, you haven't exploded in a long time.
DemoPegono: when you transport stuff via sea
CriticKitten: lol
haiyo Coldays
...well NORMALLY it's between people.
/me watches Nittany_Discord explode
/me sweeps up Nittany_Discord into a neat pile
Ah...
hi Dken2021
05,15Also did you guys hear? G4 is going away and becoming something else
But this is the internet

fluttercry: oh, how sad
fluttercry: ;_; wat
/me dusts Nittany_Discord up
fluttercry YAAAAY YAYAYAYAYAYAY
Phase4: they have a nanosuit, i think vtol crafts are more likely
05,15There was nothing good there anymore. Adam Sessler was holding that place down and he got fired for being Adam Sessler
Spectrum_Rush, thats all fine and good, but why didnt they have new craft for the airstrike?
05,15Like Jeff Gerstmann getting fired from Gamespot for being honest in reviews
and who's producing those antiquated helicopters for the bad guys
fluttercry: yeah true.. man I miss it the old Tech TV
I loved Tech TV
fluttercry: seems legit
Phase4: shits expensive
05,15otakon Screensavers all day every day
11,01Yeah. Tech TV was nice.
aww man, Adam Sessler was the only good there
Phase4: a wizard did it
dat console
fluttercry: yeah :) I loved that one cinema one that showed the short CG movies
Spectrum_Rush: hah, I remember saying that
Spectrum_Rush, nanites *snort snort*
SHE'S A PHONY!
a BIG FAT PHONY!
wait, what?
When TechTV, that was useful and fun and geeky neat, got eaten by G4, and G4 spouted only sensational stuff, it all just went wrong, completely.
could have sworn the tank shot bullets for a sec
05,15Tech TV was awesome because it had Extended Play, Screensavers, and Call for Help
One thing to Deadliest Warrior's credit, though.
that web soup show they had was nice
05,15I learned so much about computers there.
The fight scenes were hilariously choreographed.
CriticKitten: Especially pirate vs knight
05,15Luckily Leo Laporte is still on the radio
Screensavers was intelligent, and FUN and witty.
Phase4: Clarke's three laws
I like how they each politely stop hitting each other so that they can each go through their arsenal of weapons
If he don't know ya he wont talk to ya lol
remember that time AoTS showed Mugen on television and thought it was Marvel vs Capcom?
CriticKitten: ikr
Spectrum_Rush, who's what now?
05,15Oh I think Kevin Perria got fired too. and he was the last person left from Tech TV days
Phase4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws
05,15or however you spell his name
"Excuse me Mr Pirate, but I'm going to grab my mace now if you don't mind." "Not at all, good sir! I was just thinking of grabbing my grenade." "Waitwat." BOOM

fluttercry: I'm sure it is
make sure you get a Grand Slam
I hear those are good
05,15I think that's Denny's

Denny's, IHop, they both have a single vowel

cachi01: i love that video :D
ikr :D
08,01fluttercry: i've helped make a railgun
08,01they're quite simple, actually
fluttercry yeah the navy already did one
lmao ive seen that one cachi01
00,03Turtle <3
Turtle :3
05,15Yeah I see the Navy has made one. YEAH EARTH!
D:
00,03NOOOOOOO
cachi01: no habla espanol
08,01fluttercry: aye; i used to do a lot of HV/electromag stuff
wow
08,01until i almost killed myself by electrocution
08,01that was scary
I got bored in TF2 .-.
Plus the server was lagging
laters all!
08,01oh
Gonna go buy a routah :D
Bye, Kurra. :)
bye Kurra!
08,01a lightbulb just went on in my brain
Bye Kurra :)
05,15I had a teacher that did as well and has since developed a phobia of electricity
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun
Ponies47: you should buy a game since you have a desktop that can run things
08,01i just realised a possible factor in something shitty that happened the other day, that i completely forgot abotu until now
oni_link: I know
Ponies47: get Ib. free indie 32 bit horror game :)
Ponies47: it also has a beatiful story
beautiful*
shizu stream?
yep
05,15Wait, if we're building these, does that mean that Sir Isaac Newton will be the deadliest son of a bitch in space?
08,01Deadlypon3: something health related; i completely forgot about the electricity, which ay have been a factor
fluttercry, he has been for some time now :P
08,01fluttercry: Tesla is more dangerous
08,01the guy was crazy
^
08,01in the best possible way
is good point
05,15He was also damn sexy. I have no idea how he managed to be so awesome
05,15Tesla FTW
08,01fluttercry: it was his celibacy
08,01that was the secret to his power
lol
celibacy drives people to madness
tesla was ocd and fired people if he didnt like the slightest things in their outfit
oni_link, madness or genius?
very fine line that
05,15Two sides of the same coin
08,01i used to build tesla coils
Phase4: I guess it lies in the eye of the beholder as well
>.>
i might build a tesla coil
Phase4: cool
08,01Phase4: make a solid state one
05,15I built a trebuchet once. That was pretty sweet
08,01they're really fun
tesla coils can make music
08,01fluttercry: oh! i once built a trebuchet out of lego!
LEGO
05,15Nice!
13moment need drink ><
yay
08,01i made several holes in the wall of my old flat by firing 2p coins
08,01weighted it with a sock filled with lead airgun pellets
00,03:O Shizu drinks? 
08,01i would *love* to see a drunk shizu
05,15Dr.Pepper I hope
08,01that'd be hilarious
Or root beer. :3
13i wouldn't .-.
Drunk on milk, like Batman.
mmm, root beer *drools*
08,01Shizuka: come to scotland and do raisin weekend with me!
08,01okay, i need to tell you all about the St Andrews University tradition of Raisin Weekend
08,01which is next weekend
root beer ftw
08,01lemme switch computers first
05,15Personally I despise drinking, though I wouldn't mind trying cider some time
Shizuka: do you like Jager Bombs?
/me creates a river of salivation with Dken2021
05,15See, if I go to Scotland to study in a few years, I'm going to be completely lost and have no idea what's going on, but at the same time it'd be FREAKING AWESOME
08,01okay, i'm back
08,01fluttercry: do it!
08,01fluttercry: if you study in Edinburgh, come hang out with me
fluttercry: its good to get out and learn about other places. I plan on going to Japan and to live the rest of my life there and to visit the UK
the UK is great if I do say so myself
08,01ha! awesome
08,01st andrews is an awesome unoi
08,01*uni
08,01but i'm not staying there
08,01anyhoos, raisin weekend
08,01this is a really old tradition
08,01so when you're in third/fourth year at St Andrews Uni, you adopt academic children
08,01i have an academic son and an academic daughter
08,01you're mean to help them adjust to uni life
08,01and get them pissed every so often
08,01and in october, there is Raisin Weekend
08,01Raisin Weekend is kinda special
08,01it's a family bonding time
Well, I only really came here to check that this wasn't some kind of religion based on mlp, that would have screwed me adn my mates over if it was seeing as we are making one ourselves
08,01usually involving a lot of alcohol
toodles!!
08,01i'll take you through it step by step
08,01first, on the sunday morning, you go to a 'tea' party at your mother's house
^
08,01where tea is generally booze
^^^
^^^^
v
<
I don't even think we should CONSIDER ourselves as a religion. :S
>
<
We're just fans who love a show about cartoon ponies.
No we shouldnt but
08,01anyhoos
,,,?
moving along
Is there a stream on?
08,01so you then go to your dad's for another party
MOVING FORWARDS~
00,03v_v
08,01and you give your dad a present, traditionally a pound of grapes
08,01sorry, a pound of raisins
There is potential and we are working on this to make one for us all, night everypony
so AJIsAwesome|Busy what are you woriking on? :3
08,01hence why it's called Raisin Sunday
I like grapes. :3
working*
Me too :3
08,01anyhoos, nowadays "raisins" translates to "wine"
08,01because they're both made from grapes
Sweet :3
I am liking the idea of all of this
08,01(though i don't like wine, so i told my children to get me a nice dark ale)
hehehe
08,01in return, you give your children a Raisin Receipt
Shizuka: thank you for the stream!
08,01this is where the fun starts
08,01you see, a Raisin Receipt can be anything
08,01including bits of old furniture, 22" CRT monitors, fridges, etc.
fridges...
Thanks for the stream, Shizu. :)
Thanks for the stream Shizuka
/me sighs and says "Bye Everybody"
Thanks for the stream Shizuka :)
08,01anything old, bulky, and awkward to carry down the street
Bye Coldays :)
BYe, Coldays. :)
bye Coldays
05,15Shizu done streaming? Awww well it was fun!
08,01cowvarkian: it has been done in the past
^
*^^
13huh?
08,01usually a small broken fridge
hahaha
Shizuka: apparently you're leaving
13when did this happen
08,01anyhoos, you need to write a statement in latin on it
Shizuka: now
bye Coldays
08,01more about the latin later
My stream won't load, so I didn't know. :D
05,15Everyone was saying thanks for stream, which is usually the signal that it's over
^^:D
08,01anyhoos, you party all night
^^^^
^^^^^^
*^^^
08,01then, in the morning, the academic mother dresses up her children in costumes
hi everypony!
00,03Thanks for the stream, fluttercry!
carats, everywhere!
Hi pony_2746 :)
05,15But I don't stream!
05,15....yet
Thanks for the MLG, Scoots!
00,03You will!
I MISSED A STREAM? NUUUUU
05,15BUT WHEN I DO!
fluttercry: thats what you think
Hi, pony_2746. :)
08,01and they make their way, dresses in a ridiculous fashion, and carrying their raisin receipt, to the quad
00,03You will stream some MLG Black Ops 2 MP with me~
ello pony_2746
08,01now, earlier i mentioned the latin
:)
Scoot-Scootaloo: PC? ._.
:3
05,15There will be a lot of power rangers and Breaking Bad
wut
fluttercry: at the same time?
fluttercry: what about breaking bad? im watching it right now
00,03Eww who plays CoD on PC |

00,03:|
fluttercry: zordon doing meth?
Scoot-Scootaloo: ikr
Scoot-Scootaloo: Damn it all.
05,15and Black Ops 2 MP with Scoots
00,03:D
08,01this is something along the lines of "i (academic parent's name) have given this raisin receipt as according to the traditions of the University of St Andrews, founded in [pick one of 1411, 1413, or 1414]"
Scoot-Scootaloo: u getting BO2 FOR xbox or ps3?
00,03xbox~
08,01because there are several opinions as to what year the university was founded
so is anything playing? i see nothing...
00,03I'll get it after Halo 4!
08,01you're just meant to pick one of those years at random
08,01that's what the university does
Scoot-Scootaloo: I'll get it after AC3
Halo 4~
Scoot-Scootaloo: y u no get it for ps3? :(
WHOS GONNA STREAM NEXT?
00,03Because rasins
Scoot-Scootaloo: i guess i will have to kick your ass in halo 4
PS3 is too MLG for Scoots. :3
00,03sonicandmario85: Captain Price will stream next
00,03WOAH
Scoot-Scootaloo: I would play console, if I owned one and I could actually use a controller without looking like a pony trying to type on a cellphone.
08,01anyhoos, on their way to the quad, they can be stopped by a graduate student and inspected
AJIsAwesome|Busy: damn right
oh my.
08,01and they have to check that the latin is correct
08,01which, of course, it never is
00,03PS3? MLG? Sonnnn you best be crazy~
08,01because the date is always wrong
08,01(because there are 3 to choose from)
Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
Scoot-Scootaloo: I gotta play Halo4 with you D:
i like PS3 ...
^
i like all consoles
08,01so the poor first years then have to recite the uni song
^

Whoops, sorry Scoots. I meant to sat that Wii U is too MLG for you. :3
Good news everyone!
cachi01: Agreed.
Yes, ZoidbergBestPony?
08,01anyhoos, upon reaching the quad, there is a massive foam fight
ZoidbergBestPony: Yesh? :3
08,01cowvarkian: yup
00,03Eh, I'll give you that AJIsAwesome|Busy ...

:D me to cachi01
meh, the math could be done
i used to havve a psp
likeaboss: yay :D whats ur psn?
That's a toughy. I'd suggest trying your best to go over the lines with the mouse. It will be tedious and may hurt your wrist a lot, you may be able to pull it off. As for colouring, add a layer and put it under the redone sketch's layer.
???
hello!
hello
Hello
lali-ho!
hello
If you want to do good lineart, Reikim, it's best to use...
It's not just that, though. There's a couple things.

Ah, one sec, Reikim.
I AM BBAK
This si really messed up
After long break

oh snap!
First off, if you want good line art with a mouse, it's best to use a Linework layer.
