Hello dishwasher_EXTREME
SCIENCE CHANNEL
Ads are evil
GilDash: What do I have to worry about?
3D Shows kkinda have a reputation of beeing bad, there aren't much that are good

dishwasher_EXTREME: Ponies on the hub
dishwasher_EXTREME: capitalism
hey dishwasher_EXTREME hows your day been
Ninjazz: I don't know. But you *are* worried, so... :(
dishwasher_EXTREME commercials

Lil_B I dunno, the Green Lantern show is pretty good.
00,10what does it take to be a hero? around 12 bucks a month
is anyone going to watch toonami tonight?
Sumica: too expensive XD
GilDash: I told you I'm not worried... Apparently, I'm pissed off.
Where I live, the only cable TV is Comcast and the same company that does my Fiber Optic internet.
Now 20% cooler.
Now 20% Cooler? :o
20% cooler
No way :D
Good addition to that commercial.
Ninjazz: Apparently? You mean you don't know?
Ever notice ow SA is wearing the same tux as Prince Wiliam?

Litwick: indeed he is, good eye
Lil_B: its a 2 parter

Well they did say ROYAL Canterlot Wedding.
Lil_B It's on Cartoon Network at about 10 PST.
andrew francis is best pony
Twi_Fi: That's the complete opposite of what I'm trying to do...
Hmm, Shining Armor's magic is red. And there's more blue than red on his cutie mark.
So of course they have to go with a ROYAL attire.
GilDash: Look... I've on the verge of screaming at something that won't scream back. I just don't... know.
EVILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!
Evil!
Eeevviiiiilll!!
GilDash: :O
Mermaid Man: EVIL!
Every Villain is Lemons
Personally, this is my favorite episode of bridezillas
im so glad they brought toonami back
damn right girl
Luna!!
Seems legit.
LUNA AGAIN
Ninjazz: ummm what is going on?
Twi_Fi: *That* is also not what I'm trying to do. :D
Luna, why you no help more? :'(
Ignored Luna is ignored.
Listen to lua
Dashie in her dress...:)
*Luna
Dat Fluttershy :D
what? Pony stream at this time?
i love it when ponies get a big grin on their faces
LUNa's warning would be more effective with a gatling gun
Lil_B Shame. It should be online somewhere.
rdibp: me too
That face of Twilight.
even more effective, btw
00,10that look on twi's face take on a whole new meaning when you realise fluttershy just flashed Twi
AJ LIE FACE!!!!
Sumica: wait-what?!
I guess my theory holds magi... er, water. That the magic can be any color on the cutie mark, but doesn't have to be the prodominant color.
Hello Alchemist

Sumica: She's too lazy to move her hooves.

Kandarihu: There were two guard by the door, also, they were opening it with 2 different magic auras.
00,10nah the guards closed the doors

Sumica: good point.

Hello pyrocatboy
I'm bringing it up on my computer now.
Hey Twi_Fi. Is your name a stereo system are a ship I have never seen before? XD
Hey, if Chrysalis let Twi alone, she would give up and Chrysalis could win easily.
i wish i had the hub :(
im almost finish practicing "you're gonna go far kid on the piano
I dont care what anypony says.... I bucking sing the theme at the top of my lungs! :[
I still want to be able to see common ads between GBTV and The HUB. I suppose the only thing that it might be is Gerber College Plan.
00,10lol I just remembered the issues I used to have with my new place and trying to stream pony.
Lil_B Protocols for what?
I will never join you, carebears
00,03inb4 Care Bears is the new MLP
those kids are cute
Scoot-Scootaloo: Oh god! :D
Scoot-Scootaloo: Lolnope.
00,10the power used to die in my house right at sunrise every day
care-a-lot?........that sounds familiar
Sumica wut? XD
00,10right when pony eps came on
RaveBrony: lol I sing it in the shower. And at times catch myself humming it lol.
00,03What is this...
the hub reminds me of the shows i used to watch in my childhood. does anypony else feel this way?
You had daily power outages?
00,10turns out there wa a short in the photosensor that controlled the yard lights
Twi_Fi Well I like it. Its a good name =P
Explosive sounds? Micheal bay edition
00,10so when the yard lights went off it triped the breakers
Lil_B: what do you mean by apprenticeship?
Sumica: And lights out for sumi lol.
Lil_B Oh that is cool.
00,10as well as stream death for viewers
Needs less commercial and more ponies!
PONIES! Ahem...
BACK FOR PART 2
So is livestreaming the hub on saturdays now a thing?
no
00,10might be a thing at least so long as people want to watch ponies and aquabats
Alchemist I can't quite explain... I need to learn how to work in a laboratory and a lot of theory of chemistry, before i can get a job
I wonder how old Chrysalis is.
WHO WOULDNT WANT TO WATCH PONIES OR AQUABATS?
I am ALWAYS up for aquabats
HADOU-KEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lil_B outside of uni/college?
remember this show used to be about friendship?
Twilight rage o.o
Alchemist it'

00,10would not normaly stream ponies, cause you know local copys are better then live tv
oh shit magic cannon
Likely story.
LIKLEY STORY
*rememberance
awwwwww
:D
Dat twilight Glomp
yay
Dat smile :D

Well, the anti-bronies certainly wouldn't want to watch ponies. And there's still a limitation to the Aquabats appeal too.
sylandest- lol
Daaw...
00,10but seeing as ponies is on right before new eps of aquabats
who here is an anti-brony?
Aquabats has become my replacement for Ponies

Glorious song!
THIS DAY WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT

I was so surprised that this one best song here :P

Why would there be anti-bronies in a brony livestream? O_o
I sing that colt version tho

i think the same person that does cadence's voice does diamond tiara's new voice
Hope we get another villain song in season 3
i dont sing it at all !!!lol
Hello everypony.
rdibp: you didn't ask who HERE wouldn't want to watch ponies. You asked who, without any modifier.
Lil_B: it is a great thing you do. Im at uni and Im being bombarded with useless stuff. Sure Im in labs a lot but the equipment is archaic, so I dont get that much useful experience...
Alchemist I really don't know how to explayn this, sorry
Yeah, lol
this bgm rocks]
Chrysalis I suppose. :p
In the mirror her eyes is closed. Cameraside it's not
Dat love :'(
Soooooooooooooooooon!

Lil_B: its okay I think I know what you mean. :)
I REALLY wish people could just burst into song irl without anyone staring :D
Alchemist yes, like this and the equipment here is also rather old :/

For the sake of rhyming, neither Cadence nor Chrysalis refer to the stallion that they're trying to marry by name, just as the groom.
Her voice is Golden O.O

Ponyfan1999: Ronald McDonald isn't creepy.

Deceptions.
1,11One of the improvements from the original is that this film actually explains the philosophy behind the Karate Kid's seemingly meaningless work. The original shows WHAT it does, but never explains the hidden meaning of it.
DAT AWESOME KARATE KID
I KNOEW IT.
And then everything was kung fu
Dat realization
so I can do kung fu by playing videogames all day?
Meanwhile, everything IS kung fu.
So.. if I take my jacket on and off a thousand times... I will become a kung fu master?
My pet is Kung Fu.

Jakie Chan- He can even make picking up jackets cool.
Silverscreen: agreed :)
Damn, I left my jacket at work on Friday...

Pony fu is best fu

1,11@RyunosukeKnT: Correct, but in the film, it shows that the opponent's dojo puts more focus and emphasis on the offensive concept, hence why defence is so important. Not to mention that Defence is meant to be the purpose of Kung Fu and Karate anyway.

So why is the KARATE KID learning KUNG FU ?
A buddy of mine does Tai Chi Chuan and he's pretty much impossible to land a hit on.

Bronysith: I meant Thorn's comment.
it is annoying as hell to spar with them.
Ictiv: Be,.
/me hugs GilDash
GilDash|Dinner: It's "de" "le" or un" in french, "de" is pretty much used like the word "some" in French, so d'eau would be "some water".
snakey lady
MicTheSpectator: which was?
Balance, posture, movement, and never breaking eye contact. Have fun with that.
GilDash: -_- but now my argument is invalid.
08,01Thorn: turned on by what?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The style of Kung Fu that the female snake charmer is practicing is Crane Style Kung Fu. Practitioners of this style are very adept at balancing on one foot, as a crane does. It is interesting to note that she is controlling a cobra. This is another nod to the original The Karate Kid in which Daniel defeated a member of the Cobra Kai dojo by using the Crane technique.
Snake just had a boner.
"HEY LADY WHATCHA DOIN! :D"
This movie is awesome x)
Ictiv: I wait for something like that.

What is two people who drank the water fight each other?

GilDash: e__e meanie
Well also GilDash, "l'eau" would be "the water" or in some cases just "water" and "un eau" would be "a water" which you wouldn't use.

you don't copying the snake, the snake copies you!
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: One of the most important teachings in Kung-Fu is the understanding of balance, as represented by the Ying Yang symbol. The concept of balance is shinned on by the idea that Students can teach their masters as much as their masters teach them. This is a major aspect of Chan's character late in the film.
Om: I'd much rather have you. ;)

What Silverscreen just described would never happen in the USA, so a foreign film company can come over and film in any landmark that they want and still continue the narrative of us being some sort of corporate-controlled dictatorship.

You don't talk if you liked it
In china, nothing is simply "brilliant"
He only speaks Hungarian
and he still thinks that's a good symbol...
He flipped her off
1,11RANDON MOVIE TRIVIA: In china, silence is the ultimate respect to give after a performance, while loud noice is considered incredibly disrespectful. This and Dre's "Pinkie Promise" sign, which in China is the middle finger, is more than enough for her parent to disaprove of him.
"I don't want you talking to that guy"
lol
and his dad is all "do not associate with rude foreign boy"
Acleps: Yeah, they've always seemed to fuck up my class schedule everytime I move and it's even worse being in high school because of how colleges look at courses and stuff. I don't know exactly how but I think I have an idea...
Saw that coming.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Before the tournament, Han (Jackie Chan) gives Dre (Jaden Smith) a shirt to compete in. Dre comments that the shirt is just like one that Bruce Lee wore. One of Jackie Chan's early breaks in movies was to be a stunt coordinator in Lee's films; Chan also had small parts in Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon.
