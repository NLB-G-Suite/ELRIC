Hi, Good afternoon everyone
Hi T
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
dat bass
Hello TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
I can tell there must be quite the moodswings in this movie, considering the scope of the TV series it's based on.
00,03ooh, british video!
Dis Song <3
:'(
Oh my god... :'(
11,01Wait.
11,01Why not save her?
Because the attempt would have probably killed her painfully.
Nittany_Discord, because the only way they could try to revive her would break every bone in her body.
;__;
11,01Bones grow back together.
For those who want it, The Last Remnant is like 3 bucks in GmG
what's this?
Nittany_Discord, over time, but she'd feel the pain.
11,01For a while.
dat spoiler
11,01Not forever.
00,03SPOILERS
this seems weird
Nittany_Discord: She'd have probably died in pain from the revival attempt.
11,01What was that Scoots?
my art is being followed by a whole..... 1 PERSON! duh dunn!
00,03And this shit was sad :'(
Nittany_Discord: they may grow back incorrectly. but thats what they said
Nittany_Discord: he just mentioned the bones
00,03It was about some guy who said things to his mom in her deathbed
that's KH1?
BOOO KINGDOM HEARTS
Havent played it... Is the first one for ps2 or 1?
PS2
Never played Kingdom Hearts.
i like the memory one
Should brobly try and find a emu for it.
I know the first one was acceptable
probly**
but the second went full retard with the story
Meanwhile: the first one is a fun action game if you completely ignore the confusing story :D
Pfft. "It's fun if you ignore this part" Never spells good.
CrimsonPhoenix: and it became way too simple with the combat
Meanwhile: Yeah
I didn't know that MadSurge
This is such a beautiful song.
the sanctuary song was even better imo
2 things in life i dident belive untill it was released: Peter jackson doing LotR and disney doing cross over with square :)
Meanwhile: the best part of the game was beating the bonus bosses, literally :D
Did any of the Pixar franchises ever get represented in Kingdom Hearts? Or only Disney Classics?
If these credits are anything to go by I'd say only Disney.
Think its only classic
Kandarihu: as far as I know only classic stuff
What about Enix franchises?
Pony!
well guys imma get outta here. later y'all
good song
Later
Bye, BronyInstrumental
Kandarihu: well there was some fina lfantasy stuff
Kandarihu: nope, they wisely said "don't touch our stuff assholes" :D
finaly ponys :D
So that Dragon Quest is still seen as a decent RPG series :D
:[ funy
Nice duds
all right, what time is star wars tonight?
MadSurge, last I knew, Final Fantasy is still the king of the RPG franchises.
00,037pm I believe
Kandarihu: final fantasy 13 is terrible though
Fallout for me
00,03And after this, it's time for some creepy shit~
Well thanks for the warning Alej.
Kandarihu, that depends on who you ask
00,03No... I'm serious.
They've made some bad installments. 12, I hear was great.
Dragon Warrior is pretty popular as well
Erm isn't that Elder scrolls/Fallout
Scoot-Scootaloo: some more creepypasts stuff?
Five bits says it isn't even that creepy.
Kandarihu: the best final fantasies were 6 and 7
Kandarihu: yeah, but the last games weren't as well received, while the last two Dragon Quest are arguably the best of the series
00,03Somethin' like that~
Same engine for oblivion as fallout 3 and vegas
Deus ex is supposedly an amazing rpg
and it is actually
Bronysith: Yeah it's a first person RPG to be exact
Loved the new Deus ex, a little short though
It's a really interesting hybrid
imo, I have not played a bad Dragon warrior game
Scoot-Scootaloo: no screamers this time i hope?:P
im talking about the first deus ex Scribble_Ink
Oblivion wasn't one of my favs. Just due to like only 3 voice actors
00,03I hope!
11,01Scootapasta?
Borg: skyrim only has 4 voice actors
Scribble_Ink: Deus ex short? u srs?
See? An improvment?\
killerpony7733: he is talking about the new one
I actually missed it, got the first one on steam and gonna give it the time it deserves soon.
liking a game because of VA is not the basis of a good game
/me is a sucker for screamers
oh look its Nova
see FFx/X-2 :)
Skyrim improved on the last games voice actors!
Ok. I don't know what I'm looking at but it's weird.
i have no idea what this is
Bronysith: Still even that one lasted almost 30 hours for me in general
Borg: with 1 voice actor
Yep!
a bit quiet
*cheap asses*
/me remembers games before there were VA's in them
^
Daggerfall! :D
Morrowind is amazing
i love morrowind
11,01Ryunosuke: Same.
11,01Read the text.
Nittany_Discord: yup
11,01Or silent characters.
Ohay Gumby X3
the problem with alot of games
morrowind was best elder
is that they are becoming... interactive movies basically
what the hell is gumby
/me remembers his first game *Mario Party 2*
Agree with pony_701
I'm not so sure...I haven't played anything pre morrowind..how bout daggerfall?
My first game was super mario 64
11,01Some AAA titles are.
00,03That is Igglybuff, i believe
morrowind > oblivion > skyrim
I didnt like oblivion
Dagger fall was so fun, but sadly i dont think i can handle the grapic today :(
Morrowind had a bad engine.
pony_701: /)
Borg: nope
morrowind > skyrim > oblivion
I'm gonna go play TF2 to for bit :P
Scoot-Scootaloo: It's obviously Mallow
red_ony: um no
Bronysith: (\
red_ony: replace oblivion with skyrim
Daggerfall had one thing i miss in the new games though: Climbing skill.
Have fun Ponies47
Climbing?
Scribble_Ink: i enjoy morrowind though...
climbing sounds interesting
Hello everypony.
One thing skyrim lacks is....fun
Yes, you could clim on houses and walls if you were good enough in that skill.
I'm more an RTS guy myself /:
but I did like morrowid over skyrim simply due to skills
climb**
Bronysith: i had fun.
I love the freedom in morrowing..what the fuck happended to flying and teleportation spells?
red_ony: ikr
or spears?
morrowind was best game for that guy faling from the sky with the power jump scrolls
that was hilarious
i pissed myself with laughter when that happened
flight of icarus
Anyone else like RTS games? Rise of nations, Stonghold Crusaders, LOTR:BFME?
11,01Talking rods.
Skyrims only problem is the new chracter system. Miss the old one :(
yeah..I love charts
^^
Bronysith i heard that there was some way to save that guy
Scribble_Ink: what? skyrim has alot of problems
The problem with Skyrim is all the sexual mods
Borg: i like stronghold. i remember abusingthe cowboulder bug
08,01sexual mods?
can we actualy watch some pony related vids soon
Borg: the problem with skyrim, IS EVERYTHING
Do tell
Borg: modsa rent a part of the official game..thats like saying the problem with mlp are clopfics
Morrowind had ... explicit mods as well
Bronysith: no.
Borg: Got most of those you mentioned
08,01Dj_Cyber-4G: nope
damit
majoras mask <3
why
Ben drowned.
Of course.
CBB/UNP mods
00,03You know what's coming...
This is my favorite zelda Scoot-Scootaloo
SO AWESOME
Good evening everypony.
i wanted it to be donkey kong 64
08,01Dj_Cyber-4G: because we're watching something else
Inb4 you've met with terrible fate haven't you.
oh, hey Ben
basically a full nudity mod
Hi Malavolent
i said soon not now
xD yeah some mod makers obviously watched to much hentai
I wanted donkey kong 64
I find that skyrim is ok but is underrated for the current tech.
You shouldn't have done that Scoot-Scootaloo...
Borg: what are you talking about? skyrim is the most overrated game of the decade
08,01Dj_Cyber-4G: well, it depends on what whoever is streaming wants to stream
duh fuq?
Ban drown
What is wrong with his spine?
08,01Dj_Cyber-4G: we generally only stream ponies on Brony Movie Night
ben even
I do love skyrim, but i agree that its overated.
I mean underated grapics and NPC engine.
08,01oh, also, we're streaming Die Hard and Star Wars tonight, iirc
Scribble_Ink: would you agree it is the most overated game of the decade?
Link ran full speed sideways into a low doorframe.
As in they such!
suck*
dat noise
13basically.. whoever is streaming gets to stream what they want to
i don't see whats so scary so far just looks glitched to me
@bronysith no, that would be the Halo games :)
when are you starting with the movies? I hate time difference...
who is streaming?
Scoot-Scootaloo:
00,03I Do What I want.avi
again, duh fuq
red_ony: What time are you on?
this game looks familiar....
Scribble_Ink: well skyrim has the worst fanboys
Scoot-Scootaloo.mp4
its almost 22:00 here
i don't see whats so scary so far just looks glitched to me
13this doesn't mean you get to pester the person streaming with requests
08,01Bronysith: i'm trying to get the Despecialised Editions uploaded for streaming tonight, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to in time
Scribble_Ink: worst community
SCOOTALOO HAS A STREAM!
08,01if not, we'll show whatever version SlurryMoon has
fings look normal now
08,01Bronysith: currently compressing it down from 6GB...
Bronysith: I see your point, but still think there is worse :)
00,03Remeber the last guy who pestered me into streaming some dumb anime? Me neither...
08,01Bronysith: exactly
I remember this game...I was like 10 when I first played and was clueless.
08,01if it happens, it happens
Scribble_Ink: i love dark souls. it weeds out the false gamers
now its weird
I rented it and err...
08,01if i can't get it to Slurry in time, we'll just have to make do; at least for the first one
08,01i'll certainly have the other two uploaded to him in time
You shouldn't have done that.
Alright.. O_O
Bronysith: youre hardly a calm and collected fan either
Und dann you were on fire.
AND EXPLODE
BUUUUUUURN
O_O
Bronysith: Havent played it... have lots of games i should play, but to much Napoleonic war right now :)

ok that was unexpected
Die Hard and Star Wars tonight? Isn't that a bit hardcore? :O
What...just....happened?!?!?!??!?!

I won't be able to go to bed before 4 in the morning with these movies..good thing I haven't got to go to mwork until next week :D
the brightness is to damn low
MAJORAS MASK is my favorite zelda game

Never played any of the Zelda games.
Sweet! *getting more beer* Me neither red_ony
Is this BenDrowned?
this is boreing [no offence]
Did you know fishes could drown?
i think so Kandarihu
08,01AttacktheAndalite: someone went and painstakingly snipped together, colour corrected, and fixed bits from all the released editions of the Original Trilogy to make them as close to the original theatrical releases (which have *not* been released in colour corrected, fixed up forms yet) as possible
You drowned as a zora...
fail
00,03And then Ben died
Ben Drowned.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Dj_Cyber-4G: Then go amuse yourself.
00,03That's the sound of Aliens doing what they want!
Dj_Cyber-4G: Then do something else to not be bored,
08,01of course, the order in which to watch them is: IV, V, II, III, VI, with I as an optional "kiddie" extra

that was RD practicing, she was only able to break the sound barrier
08,01it's porbably the worst thing he's ever written
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: they probably find us boring :D
Alister: i never said anything about star trek movies
that was so fake, it isn't even funny
Bronysith: sorry then
08,01Alister: /)

did he just call her Shawty?
00,03Oh snap guys! Requim for a Dream song! This is SRS BSNS
now for the overly dramatic music
So... this video is about... jesus... that came from norway... to fox news.
Dat Requiem for a Dream
Yup
was the best thing about a movie I didn't like...if I only remembered the name^^
08,01it's hard fact that the best Trek films, in order, were: 2, 4, and 8
its obvious Aliens are testing our reactions
13and nemesis

requiem for a dream! :D

untill someone bothers to fly up there and look, i don't give a shit
and hi Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 :)
Kandarihu: I use it from time to time to empthasize a point else not really a big user of it
Shizuka: yup
13i'd rank nemesis higher than insurrection easily
Oh mah gawd we get it. /)Aliens(\
there was no reason for more Alien movies after Alien2
I meant as being rude to him.
Captain Olimar!
OK I think they are realzies now
08,01Shizuka: they were both basically the same film, though
11,01I really think the China one is a rocket.
And... I just crossed the line again.
08,01and nemesis had more pointless sequences, and writing wankery that was trying to *blatantly* copy Wrath
Kandarihu: Ah i know what you mean
Stop it we need no mo proof!
If those were really aliens we would already know, i mean how many satalites do we have orbiting the earth?
ooh, purty :3
No mo proof!
lol, Russia
No mo proof!
That looks like a flare
No mo proof!
Russia is just testing rockets
11,01That one also looks like a rocket.

/me facepalms from all the fake alien lights
Fun fact:We are in such a big universe we being the only intelligent life is pure stupid
Looks like a giant peeweee
Eulshy: buuuut OBVIOUSLY aliens have undetectable technology to travel in space! *derp*
i think it's just celestia visiting earth :P
If the universe is really as wast as we think it is probable that there are other life forms out there..and also very unlikely that we ever get to meet them..
How long is this?
Fun Fact: Professors in the 3rd Reich also worked in the Field of Levitation, the "Objects" were Bell-shaped, most of these Professors were brought to the USA where they continued their experimets, they kept the bell shape, mut made it more flat (the common UFO -shape) teh first UFO-Sigts were spottet near their Research-Labs
Oh my god, it's KERBALS!
11,01Hell, he's using footage I've seen of a rocket launch and calling it a UFO.
Um...
> Aliens come to greet us, > Lets take them prisoners and disect them to look at their organs
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: seems legit
Madsurge: If people really wanted to know if there were aliens, why the hell don't they get in a helicopter really faat and go look at the shit
Man he is a bad acter
He was about to break into laugh
I'd assume aliens are watching our TV and our transmissions, and are not happy with what they're seeing.

ponibas: The moon hopefully
Nittany_Discord: We do have the Southeaster Brony group. You might find some there
Sumica: needs more solid rocket boosters , like seven

"Houston, we have a lol"
You never know till you ask or have something pony on

11,01AttacktheAndalite: You'll have to link me to them.

Nittany_Discord: Okay. Well I have 2 links for you :3
11,01Now it's getting windy.
i mean in best friends way, if that's ok.
Nittany_Discord: Leave the curry alone
it is :P
simce im starting junior and moved here recently , im going to play closet for a couple weeks till i meet peopl , then bust out every shirt and bracelt and other merc
11,01cratorkid: Do you live in Rock Hill?
Nittany_Discord: yes

*Activating Derpy Launcher*
:P)==,
Nittany_Discord: moving into soon yea
Well I'm gonna play some Pokemon Black
11,01Oh.
Sumica: Please tell me you haven't been taking my Crystal Meth stash because that is NOT going to work.
SpadeMagnes[R]: have fun :)
Is this that Gary's Mod I hear so much about?
rainbow: i can talk to myself
Nittany_Discord: why?
Ann: no
this is Kerbal Space Program
Ann: No it's kerbal space program
Ann: No its Kerbal Space Program
11,01Thought of meeting up, but I don't think your parents would approve.
Ah, well thanks for that then. *thumbs up*
Derpdash: We said the same thing :D
Nittany_Discord: Of course they wouldn't, some random adult just taking their kid away
11,01Exactly.
That's how *ahem* bad things happen kids
I think I found a brony in Cairne(My WoW realm)
killerpony7733: Bronylepathy maybe?
:P
yea... Nittany_Discord my mums really wierd , not to mention she called me a fag once .. then i laughed at her
Very_Silly_Filly: But think of all the free candy!
We're everywhere, lurking, waiting, biding...
c
Meanwhile: Candy Schmandy, it's all about tea and cakes
Nittany_Discord seems like a pretty cool guy. He's mighty and doesn't afraid of anything.
I love tea and/or cakes!
I wish I could find a shiny pokemon for once
What is this going to be? A Firecracker?
11,01I'm afraid of employment.
Hi guys. Joke woke up, i love you all. <3
11,01Not joking.
11,01And I hate that fear.
I'm British, it's compulsiary to like tea and cakes. If you don't, you get lasered
i found a pink rabbit thing... once
oops, forgot about that
rather than white
Very_Silly_Filly: True facts.
11,01I don't want to sit on my ass and make $0.
So, what is the objective of this game. To launch things into space sucessfully?
Very_Silly_Filly SHHHHH were not supposed to tell them about the lasers
And work isn't that bad.
Chuggaconroy's shiny encounter was unbelievable
Nittany_Discord: Have you tried a trade or something similar like tutoring?
Nittany_Discord: If your any good with metal I can get you a job in the foundry with me.
Nittany_Discord: still some money is better then no money
work is good it gets you money
Chrysalis: Well, at least I kept the starcannon research secret....oh crap, there goes my development secret
Trades are where it's at right now. The work force is hurting hard for tradesmen/women. They're rather rewarding.
11,01Liokin-Bot: I have no experience working with metal. I doubt they'll take me.
Nittany_Discord: The work is pretty casual and in about 2 weeks i'll possibly be meeting up with AttacktheAndalite -lol
He was in the Burned Tower looking for a koffing, and A. first encounter was said pokemon, and B. It was shiny
Nittany_Discord: Have some fun with thermite. You'll learn a great deal
Nittany_Discord: Hmm....Well I could probably train you its not to hard. As long as your not squeemish around extreme heat.
Liokin-Bot: that's IF I can. I have school 3 nights a week, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
AttacktheAndalite: Yup.
11,01Liokin-Bot: Extreme heat doesn't bug me.
11,01How many hours do you work a week?
My Cleffa won't listen to me
Nittany_Discord: Well it depends really.
Liokin-Bot: That job would be perfect for me :C Not only am I good at product design, but I'm used to constant temperatures of 30-40 degrees c
Thats what i get for trading
Sumica http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.net/kerbal-space-program-mods first one is a nice set
I still wonder what this woman is doing in this trailer in this forest
11,01I took Radiative Transfer. Know how heat works.
Any Maine, USA Bronies in here?
oh....
yes
hmm, wonder how easy to edit the files are
jk lol
I mean what is that woman doing alone in that forest
Calcos, we've been over this.. no bronies in Maine
Nittany_Discord: My set hours are 6. 9:00 to 3:00
ponibas: ...but I'm here...
Nittany_Discord: But I can get called in to work anywhere from 24 hours to 3 days
lies :p
So, who's streaming again?
Biglaw: Sumi is
Nittany_Discord: But my pay sir. Well I can deffinetly compete with some doctors :D
Biglaw: Sumi is
inc spam of yays
ah, okay
11,019 PM is not a bad start time.
I remember when Sumica made the Space Drill of Death
woaha
11,01But you worked 3 days in a row sometimes?
yay
That configuration reminds me of Boilogic Space Labs.
Nittany_Discord: Yup, provides me with plenty sleep in hours.
Hey guys, i was bored so i created this in spore. Its mah spaceship =D http://www.pictars.com/users/blessedspirit/Banshee.jpg
Is there a point to this woman npc in the Lostlorn forest in my Pokemon Black game?
If someone ever asks who's streaming, noone answer and let the streamer just say (I am) Just I am. I would be the perfect trolling mechanism
11,0172-hr work day?
Nittany_Discord: Yeah. But you get payed for 72 hours worth of work.
Nittany_Discord: And the starting wage is 14.75$
11,01That doesn't make sense.
11,01I don't even think that's legal.
11,01You can't work someone for 72 hours.
Nittany_Discord: -lol its very legal.
yay
Sumica once it finishes updating to .16 i should be able to mod the decoupler for larger parts
Nittany_Discord: There are beds here.
*yay*
ok then
Sumica makes sense, and good luck with your Rocket.... Thing
but not the laws of Pinkie Pie?
Sumica: -lol well 72 hours of pay says I can do it! >:3
WELP
:D
Oh whoops.
dat worked
Nittany_Discord: What about the army? They work for days on end.
XD
*yay*
Exactly.

Nittany_Discord: Well anywho. If your interested and are willinng to learn a new skill or 7 tell me :3 -lol Im like 90% sure I can get you hired on the spot.
So I found out that Target had the MLP trading cards
But they were sold out
flutter_spin: that feel
Question: What's big and white and can kill you if it falls from a tree?
11,01Liokin-Bot: Where do you live?
Derpdash: snow?
What... what are those? Space bananas?
twitchy tail!
Toys R Us got blind bags, but they were the same first waves
11,01My issue is anxiety on the job.

Answer: A refrigerator
Yay
Do a barrel roll?
11,01Very stupid shit.

Nittany_Discord: Id be working with you step by step. I wont let you fail dont worry -lol
Sumica: maaaaayyybe you shoudl try some fins

Well.....
Your little dudes are freaking the fu*k out >.<

Quick, kill him before he reports to the media what a disaster the launch attempt was!
11,01Liokin-Bot: To be honest, the job doesn't sound that bad.
Nittany_Discord: Hopefully anyways.
Keep in mind Fusion Bolt is the signature move of Zekrom and Flare is the signature move of Reshiram
rainbow: and its like $15
wow

It's been 15 years and I still have NFC what to do for my career

How much fuel does that booster have?
But there's no pressure on how long you play it
Liokin-Bot: (\ sup :D

monsoon
13i miss monsoon season
13big storms all day
twitchy tail!
Eulshy: Ok, because I'm trying to organize my PC box
Liokin-Bot: I love flamethrowers, I made one out of a kitchen spray
I figured to have all the legendarys in one group
13i kind of miss phoenix in general
O.o
Shizuka, I grew up in Maine... this is death for me here
Sumica The Final Countdown should be played :p
Just throwing it out there, this doesn't look hopeful right now.
13pff i moved there when i was 7 from illinois

xD
13how do you think i feel :3

The only reason I'd ever want to go to Phoenix is during the winter months, so I can walk around in short sleeves and shorts, getting strange looks from everyone
whuut
lol
Booooom!
hot and sticky? :p
11,01Win for Sumi.
New EQD Post: It's nothing
13we get slightly less hot up here but the humidity is murder
dem ponies :3
WHOOOA
Only reason I would go to Phoenix is to watch Nascar, but chances are I'd probably go to talladega
13and since it's minnesota we don't have AC in the house... have to make do with window units
More Rockets?
now to figure out how to add color with SAI
I also live in Florida.. I know about the humidity.. beat weather I ever had was when I was stationed in Hawaii
ugh, i WISH it was hot around here, it's been sunny today for the first time all year!
or go to paint lol :p

13i'd like to move back to illinois... milder winters and better rain
Nittany_Discord: We also make several things such a weaponry. Vehicle bodys. Somedays we may just be down there getting payed for keeping the furnace burning if we dont have any commisions.
Britain: You're either freezing your tits off or you're melting in heat

meow
Biglaw: It can take it. El shitbox may be slow, but it can take some serious heat
Yeah, running two linked server computers, a main computer, three monitors, an external harddrive and a laptop in one room tends to heat it up really, really quickly.
Bronysith: You think I know?
Lawl.
umad

Eulshy: A fine choice. Infact, I may just copy you
CHICKEN

My friend constantly brags about his top end Falcon
Me!

otakon: The better question would be who isn't
Recently I bought Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD on Xbox Live, and it's pretty fun
Oh Gianni!
Heya otakon :)
Spins
Falcon: The worst one has 16GB ram, upgradable to 36, 4GB GPU, possible to fit a 6GB one in when they are invented, 2TB drive and 3.6 Gh/z 6 core i7 AKA: i9 processor, costs around 2000 pounds. He has one, and constantly brags >:c
So when is Starwars happening anyway?
Well in case you hit the moon, your gear is out

BronyInstrumental: Whats SW?

Derpdash: star wars
MaxTheBrony, part of the Summer Trilogy event

11,01I played the Xbox version of Bad Fur Day.
BronyInstrumental: ohhh of course i have i just never abbreviated it :)

Very_Silly_Filly I bought Conkers Bad Furday for the N64 for 60$... that game never oficialy came out in Germany -.-
there is a diference ? ._. it says linework1 normal 100%
11,01Not bad.
BOOM
O.o what was that?
Lil_B: You my friend have an awesome taste in games
i couldnt get the N64 verison since it was like $50+ more so i got the xbox verison for $20
Let's go SUPER SAIYAN 3
11,01Funny how Conker was a kid's game for the longest time.
No Kerbal, don't do it!
Hang on for dear life!
IT'S NOT WORTH IT
11,01And then they scrapped everything and made it an adult platformer.

Well depending on the layer it'll only affect what's on that layer.

Nittany: Like JonTron says: They all had a collective brain anyurism, singularity was reached, and CBFD was brought into the world.
how did he survive
Are those things in the background trees or something?
Lil_B: Gee, I wonder why? *Looks at poo, tits, gore, swearing* Hmm, no idea
Meaning if it's lines, only the lines will pick up the brush.
Oh, do the Kerbal dance
Are links ok?

11,01Still cleaner than Duke Nukem Forever.

Woah woah woah.. Conkers was supposed to be a KIDS game?!

derpy maiil!
11,01Too bad D3 sold madly.
DERPY MAIL!
Derpy Mail!

Funnily enough D3 made me reinstall d2 again..median xl mod to be exactly...
Almost
I'm used to Meanwhile's correcting, considering I'm the same nationalty and do it myself :)

My Brain...

I leik the music
Nittany_Discord: Drm?
italian intro
the mouth Animation in the Poniator Videos always looks strange to me...
Spanish!
Nittany_Discord: At their rate, Runic Games will rape the hack/slash market
Is it O.o
Also, THIS is an official intro.
best mlp intro
I've unfanned Blizzard
U srious?
no its not spanish
Firelight: could have sworn italian.
sounds real good to be a real intro
ANIME FUN!
I DEMAND A ENGLISH VERSON!

The hell is DRM?

Firelight: an*

SpadeMagnes[R]: Digital Rights Management
its not spanish
sounds itallian now
8,6guessing you worked out how to handle colors and layers in sai?
It's Italian guys
MaxTheBrony: No, it's the official italian intro
:o
00,10good thing it's not spanish then
Is it O.o
Blizzard used to make great games, not anymore...or maybe I just moved out of the target audience..
SpadeMagnes[R]: basically keeping people from fiddling with the program.
aye
We Need a English Verson.... -.-
It sounds awesome
meh...This is good.
It's italian, considering I understand about 25% of it
Firelight: we got one already
Firelight: an*
sounds italian, yet feels japanese
Clicking random stuff FTW!
otakon: Doesnt sound so bad
Blizzard was good, until Hactivision bought them
SpadeMagnes[R]: I like it.
MaxTheBrony: it's the official italian intro :)
otakon: ORLY? Saracasm.
8,6lol :p
:D
Firelight: Sarcasm*
red_ony: They still make good games. The problem isn't in the game quality, it's in the way the game is delivered.
gasp* sumica is racist
Meanwhile: And again with the corrections guys?
otakon: I saw that.
Very_Silly_Filly: I understand 100% of it :F
Picky picky.
To be honest, This is REALLY good.
Meanwhile: I thought you would.
I have hard beleiving this is the intro ^^ its spo long
I wonder what the songs sound in Italian
I'm not an ITA nub, I'm a GB nub, Okay!?
I stil think Mists is gonna be good
00,10no, I hate every one equaly
it's a really good song and video, but I honestly find this a bit too long to be a good intro :P
Pfft. Click random buttons and hope for the best.
Sumica: mrrr?
Yeah
MaxTheBrony: they use a shorter version
sumica, hey... thats my live
Ah
MLP > Anime
Sumica: You don't hate Britain thogh
line*
ponibas but Activision never did anything with them, Blizzard has still does anything on their own
and then THIS one again
YES
Though*
11,01Very_Silly_Filly: I don't think Torchlight 2 will outsell D3.
SERIOUSLY?!
Oh, this
:D this one again !
but I'm cool with that.
And kidnapping luna!
Oh that is it. GR
this one plays alot nowadays
yay, Sandman Luna!
DArn I was just listening to this damn must pause mine
I wonder what it would sound like if the voice actors were britiish.
she kidnapped me
....Youd think celestia would be pissed about receiving the same damn picture 52 times now?
Mists of Pandaria is gonna be awesome
00,10it's not raceisim if you hate every one otakon
is that luuna?
Nittany_Discord: it'll still sell well though, plus Path Of Exile is coming out.
^this
Sumica: then it's just hate.
racism*
Derpdash did you just saw the picture on memebase?
what video is this called? I MUST know.
Nittany_Discord: I beleive it will, The community pops hangs around with, around 500 bought D3, only 30 odd still play and about 80% of the people who stopped are getting TL2 now
well that's how i learn to program, screw things up until you figure out how they work :p
00,10some day I may get sick of this video
8,6yep
Sumica: exactly, you hate everyone equally :D
turtlegod98: Garden of Shadows WiP I think..
Lil_B: Yep
Sumica: but not today?
00,10by then it will probably be done
Derpdash me too XD
Sumica: I never will.
lol
Sumica: someday? :D
11,01Very_Silly_Filly: Did they stop playing because of the DRM?
God damn power's gonna go out! O.o
8,6I saw you mention the line layer earlier, sai has 2 types of layers, one for bitmap, one for vectors
Time consuming, but it works
Fisheh_Fish: shit man!
No, seriously, Luna's KILLING children! and none of you seem to care!
Whats so bad about DRM?
:c
I'm sorry, I must goggle that MLG phrase
:P
Fisheh_Fish: get to a generator!
8,6different options pop up depending on which you create
Lil_B, not entirely true.. Acitvision has hastened production on a few projects
*Sigh* I need some pings to Annoy to get this song out of my head...
I wasn't unhappy with D3, it just seemed to fall victim to overhype. I mean, don't get me wrong there's a lot I don't like about it, but it's still a good game.
00,10I see now killing
Oh, Digital rights, derp
and i am back
()*@$(*@&#%(
welcome back
SpadeMagnes[R]: basically it's measures to lock games so they can't be modded, copied and you have to go through stupid hoops just to play it.
11,01Digital Rights: You have none as a gamer.
umm...what am i watching?
i am so FUCKING PSYCHED
brb, grabbing my glock
This scene makes me think of Storm of the Century
11,01You don't even own the game.
Ever happen to notice that every new MMO that comes out people say its gonna kill off WoW?
saw that now one allow me for lines and fine stuff :p the other one is for coloring stuff
Nah, they stopped playing because the loot system is very fucked up
well i think
And a few other reasons
SpadeMagnes[R]: yep
Lets Hear The Yay Beverly Hill Cops Theme song Remix.
It gets annoying
Lets face it, Blizzard are screwed if they do not get their shit together soon
i am so happy
THIS WAS A REALLY GREAT SONG!
Stephen King, with the guy and the cane - "Give me what I want, and I'll go away"
SpadeMagnes[R]: Haven't heard that in a few years actually^^
watching my fav movies the next fe3w days!
I love the combat and looks of TERA
YES
Le' Movie.
yay, movie time
:O
damnit
TIME FOR IT
Well, there's a lot of games you 'don't own'. It's their answer to piracy. Not the best answer but it's one. And as far as it goes in terms of profit, it works.
wait, what?
THE CHILDREN FELL TO THERE DEATHS!
SpadeMagnes[R]: Then again I don't follow game devópment much anymore
Blizzard vs. a blizzard
8,6yeah, the vector lines are based in math, so they're better for resizing images
NOPONY SEES THAT BUT ME?
About 90% of the people who were there at the start have buggered off and probably gone to Runic
its alread 1 am. i wanted to get some food before movie -.-
Pretty sure they said knights of the old republic was gonna kill WoW
It's Star Wars this week, right?
O.o omg i smell popcorn irl so freaky
SO.. ARE YOU READY.. FOR MOVIE NIGHT?!
ponibas: I honestly don't get why people are so fond of TERA's combat. I assume it's because they've never played GW2.

Nittany_Discord, I totally agree with you about this, but I'm starting to get tired of hearing about it all the time.

Nittany_Discord: okay....

You said it Kirz

Goodnight guys, see you in 7 hours. I gotta sleep!
SpadeMagnes[R]: i do
TERA is something that any race cacn play any class, and they all start in the same area, no having to run for 30 minuters to get to a diffe starting sone
Aren't 98% of all MMO's Korean?

And the combat is honestly inferior to GW2's. So there's really no reason anyone should put money into TERA. :P
ah
Very_Silly_Filly: Funny way to say Fighting Games
11,01SpadeMagnes[R]: It's simple but fun.
Allright
Unless they have played CoD and they'll be like "I'm not playing this, it doesn't have killstreaks or good graphics'
Nittany: Simple butt fun?
It's about Dying Hard
00,10it's about 2 hours long
11,01CriticKitten: Yes.
Calcos323: Mortal Kombat :)
Seriously? A Baby that can Have Booze? Hell yeah.
Ann: Lol
YES MOZARELLA STICKS ARE DONE
Nittany_Discord: For somereason I have a thing for WoW so nothing else seems to impress me
True to name Mr Mclaine REFUSES to die
Firelight: Welcome to France
max payne all over again?
Holy crap die hard? what one is this?
Snopingas
I have returned
the only *shooter* I'm looking forward too right now is war of the roses..I'm a nerd..
Very_Silly_Filly: I was talking more about GOOD Fighting Games
11,01I think TF2 and L4D2 are better MP games, but they are harder to get into.
SpadeMagnes[R]: they were a little late adding the Pandas to impress me
MK is good
Dovah: the first
00,10it's monday so it's the first diehard
Is she going to SnooPING as usual
Very_Silly_Filly: What ? we don't give our babies booze D:<
War of the roses? Sounds like something that requires research.
Consuelia?
Payne, McClain, McPain
Nittany_Discord: Monday Night Combat
"No, there is no Mr Mclaine here."
Narolas: Then you are unique
No no
00,10she needs more lemon pledge
Consuelia.... Denfently.
I love no one ever bothers to read the WoW lore and relieze the Pandarens were around for awhile
11,01She needs.
Sumica: can we maybe watch star wars first tomorrow?
We have McClain's fries here though
I loved this trilogy
Sumica: Nooo, noooo~
Sumica: WRONG! it's tuesday some places :P
11,01ME!
SpadeMagnes[R]: I've known that forages
Very_Silly_Filly: No it isn't, it was only popular because it had blood. Nothing more. The same still rings true today
WRONG

DIE HARD
Die Hard Korean
Sumica is there a special reason why we are wathcing a Movie today (not that I dislike this :) )

Very_Silly_Filly: Well some people think they're just copying Kungfu panda

Bronystate runs on EST time?
Ann: There isn't much info out there. I just decided to keep an eye on it because of it'S unique premise..15, 16th centure online shooter..

SpadeMagnes[R]: Right now, as much as they have been around, theya re leaking to the side of Kung Fu panda
Dat bear
Argyle son of Argul
Very_Silly_Filly: Same thing. It was a simple game with no depth. Street Fighter will always be superior.

Street fighter was good

Special but.. fun?
I lost interest after they killed off Arthas,Zul'jin and Illidan
Citickitten: Lol Pound Puppies? Wut?
Then I went like "LOLNO"
SuperBrony64: Hold on, did you say fall*hits and gets impaled by random rock spike*
Is Pound Puppies any good? I've never watched it.
Arthas was a dick
Hai guys :D
Vordox: They did? I stopped playing blizz games after the original wow ^^
Man, I got so distracted until now. Hello, everypony
Vordox: Arthas really deserved for a better death
11,01Tonight's special guest is terrorist Alan Rickman!
hi PinkiePieYoshi64
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
Hello PinkiePieYoshi64
11,02Pound Puppies is a big, fat rip off of Hogan's Heroes.
SirGanjalf: No shit (I see only dark, dea) WHAT?!
Hola :P
How'd he end up--*hits the ground*
ALAN RICKMAN, HAVE MY FUCKING BABIES
Ann: I know right? I saw the commercials on the hub while watching MLP...
Is this Die Hard?
Good to know, thanks Super
PinkiePieYoshi64: yes
PinkiePieYoshi64: Yes
Well, actually, in our perspective, I as the tank, killed arthas with an auto attack :D
SirGanjalf: And the arthas fight...seriously..
This is Die Hard...and it is awesome..:D
Sweet- I'm waiting for Star Wars, thoough :P
dat hi-tech
I had my OWN fricking image which was like 500000x times more epic and end game
State of the art.
Hey the arthas fight was good
So high tech
00,10screw technology
SpadeMagnes[R]: No
idk if i should wait for star wars, it'll be 2AM
11,02Ann: But I never really watch it, probably only saw one episode so I'm not one to judge the actual quality of the show >>
back in the day, when this was top tier tech
11,01Screw gravity.
SpadeMagnes[R]: All heroes in the lore...and we have one that gets frozen 100% of the fight
Maid_Discord it's maid hour? O.O
Fair enough, thanks for the input SuperBrony64. I don't have cable so it's youtube all the way for me.
Vordox: Dude the sword had the power of countless souls
I watched pound puppies for 3 seconds. In those Three seconds the Leader Said: I didn't Even know you were a girl.
Vordox: and only helps at the Pinata phase?
Lets face it, WoW's dead
-.-
If everyone in the building is in the same location, why did he have to use the machine?
PFF HAH
SpadeMagnes[R]: No I menat the very fight of the raid tactic was...DUH
I mean half the community is a bunch of fucktards
I could even come up with a better fricking fight
._.
PonySpawn, because it LOOKS COOL
PonySpawn: Because He never gets to use it. ITS SO MUCH FUN.
idk since i put up so much time in WoW i think ill never leave it...
It's weird to think that MMO's are no longer the hotness
is this die hard 1 or 2?
1
00,10first

Deathwing was ok..

Diehard, the first death.

Die Hard.. That rings a Bell.
SpadeMagnes[R]: Njeh, it worked
The ending was anticlimatic
I've played WoW in '04 and quit in '10, I've been fine so far

Still Arthas fight = Most saddest ever finish
Die Hard. Die Happy.
08,01california. sounds like my kinda of place.

My last raid was full of MLG *umg u has GSORE?*
lol
Sounds Like MY laugh
Many Whelps
ha. ha. ha.
why is there a city taped on the windows?
Raid is that stuff they use to kill bugs
10-25 people in a single dungeon vying for loot Nittany_Discord
This MMO market is pretty disfunctional. World of Warcraft is the game that half of the MMO makers strive to emulate. World of Warcraft is a game that, anecdotally, seems to be the game that everyone wants to quit. And not in favor of any of it's clones.
Raid is my EXDH
They were adding Cocaine to the Coca-cola at the beginning
More DOTS
Advertisment.
Nittany_Discord: Raids are when people with no life battle against other people with no life to decide once and for all who has no life more than the rest.
Right, I'm tired,
Must've been like BONK! in those times

Sumica: will we be watching die hard first tomorrow?
StinkomanFan, Die Hard with a Vengance
00,10yeah

Reward drops, Chance to crit, stats with %...
._.
Vordox: I see you have no patience
StinkomanFan: because of space problems
thats fun
Dark_Horst: In the German dub, the names and backgrounds of the German-born terrorists were changed into English forms (mostly into their British equivalents, with the exception of Marco and Franco, who retained their Italian and French nationalities respectively): Hans became Jack, Karl became Charlie, Heinrich turned into Henry. In the scene where John is writing down the names of the terrorists, a voiceover in the German version
oh shit..sorry bout that
Ok how long was I gone playing TF2 this time? -_-
SpadeMagnes[R]: I played PSO, Diablo 2, WoW etc etc

08,01he is SO. HOt.
11,01Vordox: Do you mean random loot drops?
a voiceover in the German version says "I'm gonna call you Hans and Karl, just like the two evil giants in the fairy tale" while referring to them as Jack and Charlie later. The new background depicts them as some internationally organized terrorists having gone freelance and for profit rather than ideals.[21]
I may or may not have my Nokia 100 laying about someplace
Guns guns guns guns!

Hey Gabe! We need you to help out witht he new season! Which Season? Three. O-O

Dark_Horst English don't know how to say the "ch"... like I can't say the "th" XD
Yanno, this whole plan would be fucked with cellphones
Lil_B: oh that's not that ard actually

Oh, well. I didn't actually expect that. Garrett
dat vault
Dark_Horst I know, but I still can't do it... I think I have to watch a Slowmo of a closeup to learn how to do it -.-
Lil_B: I always get annoyed at movies using some actor's highschool german skills to depict germans..
First "fuck" of the movie...LET'S CELEBRATE
Are you talking to....yourself?
hello everypony
meep meep meep meep
Yippe-ki-yi
hai Freefall29
Lil_B: I always tried to pronounce the "ch" sound (like in Nacht, right?) as a "h" as in "hello". Thats the closest I could get.
00,10ok now we wait for otakon to triger a spam kick
Lil_B: war moviers are the worst in that regard
nine
3oh x3
nein
Lil_B: tongue tip at the tip of the upper front teeth, press air through said teeth
Sumica: not a chance and why would I?
red_ony yeah >.<
yay
otakon, cuz you always do :p
otakon: Because you do it everyday.
I'd like to see Valve's writers wrighting FiM episodes.
Sumica, what about a script that keeps track of how many times dari-bot kicks otakon
who wants a moon pie
ding
Dark_Horst I know all about the theory... I still can't...
Kandarihu: but then each episode would take a few years
writing
11,01GabeMoist is most moist pony.
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
00,10would be intersting to see if it can be made to just track otakon kicks
Nittany_Discord: That makes me moist.
Sumica: lovely idea.....
dat MP5
Freefall29, only if they're fully playable.
Ann caller id ruined Ferris Buellers Day off
we need a script to keep track of haw many times the mods get kciked for not +o
Lil_B: the important thing is just to broaden your tongue to prevent air escaping to the sides
GO didn't get any MP5 love :(
its a lie
00,10yay

3coolio
00,10well there goes all the mp5 ammo
hey guys. i finished the math segment, so i figured 'that's enough for one day' :)
^^
That gives me an idea. Who would be a better company to make an officially licensed FiM game than Valve?
hmm
which sucks cuz he uses a 9mm too, so could use the ammo
BronyInstrumental: Good thinking!
00,10DickJenson would have killed em
ded
Kandarihu: tricky question
ded
Sure, jump on top of him... you should have shot him in the leg.... :P
Kandarihu, will it be a trilogy?
neck = broken
PaladinDrakkenWolf: hivemind
lol he ded
i'd have shot him in the head while the gun was three
aww hes already ded
I am Still waiting for Valve to Release Chompski : Ultimate Badass
GabeMoist, you know Valve doesn't do trilogies. It would be a Duology.
'Damn, should have just shot him'
GabeMoist: silly, valve can't count to three
I'm going to give that kill to gravity.
ponibas: caliber in itself is not sufficient. You have to have the same cartridge size.
00,10all that security and they dont have a glass relocker?
Why do they always have to add stupid sound effects to computers in movies ?
brb
A computer doesn't do a sound every time you press a button, jeez
"Ah-ah-ahh, you didn't say the Magic word.... Ha-ha -hat, You din't say the Magic word..."
Because it's high tech!
NOW I HAVE A WALLET, HOHOHO
Sumica: they have a huge fricken metal relocker
11,01Because it's cool.
Narolas, it's the coconut effect, I think.
Alchemist: i think the mp5 uses the same parabellum ammo than a g17
if you want a trilogy. have it mlp:fim, mlp:fim episode 1, and mlp:fim episode 2 as the final episode of the trilogy
Alchemist, please don't get started.. it's a movie.. and I am very verse in the differnt types of 9mm ammo
11,01It would be funny if it did Narolas
Narolas: I have no idea. But reminds me of cellphones
His had snapped bad, his neck went crack, Punk********** ain't worth the slap
yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Alchemist: so if he had a glock, that would be possible
I would get annoyed very quickly Nittany_Discord :p
GabeMoist I am Still waiting for Valve to Release Chompski : Ultimate Badass

Ah well, just wanted to see what was playing. Need to watch other things tonight.

Star Wars. I'm guessing we're talking originals, because prequels would generate a lot of controversy.
Calcos323: You know. Your a pain in the neck.
just as nobody speaking english would ever say "make go"
Carl Winslow, Is this Family Matters the movie?
Liokin_Bot, Likewise, bro
Calcos323: But ill be damned if I wouldnt take a bullet for ya bro.

Ponies47, go to the steam website and look up your profile
Lil_B: and the writer, for not noticing in the first place
It would be hillarious if the prequel movies were streamed. The level of butthurt would be MASSIVE.

Ah, I like to think I have good taste in animation :p

If I'm not mistaken, the animator for the first version of Clone Wars was a man by the name of Milton Pool, who's currently working on his game Oversoul
thats not how you cut it... remeber, down the street, not across the road
I watched Samurai Jack for a while. I felt too sorry for all those robots, though.
Calcos323: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx5lqyG19e1qaa7gwo1_400.jpg
Well it's worth watching what's there. I need something good to watch.
im a filly and what is blood?
Kandarihu: dude you can never feel sorry for the robots.

Ah, John Macclane, one of the LOL 90s action heroes.
I get the "arrow to the knee" though.
otakon need a good game, why not skyrim?
JackofApples: 90s?
the duke was cooler
Ummm
Ann: Dawnguard is pretty good, really more of the same.
Besides. it's pretty simple to tell who's going to die in Samurai Jack. Humans or other living beings survive, no matter what. Robots ALWAYS die violently, no matter what.
Thrackerzod: agreed.
Hello
Yes.
The 90s.
JackofApples '88
Kandarihu: well not always
88?
Eff Bee Eye
So much stuff to look up
/me likes pie

Thanks for the game reference.
JackofApples the movie was made in 88 as far as I know
Here's the wiki page for the version of Clone Wars I'm talking about: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Clone_Wars_%282003_TV_series%29
There were some exceptions after I stopped watching?
Kandarihu: I saw ONCE a biological being get badly hurt.

And it seems to be a pretty common element on the internet now for half of the people here to go through Fox News Derangement Syndrome whenever the FOX logo appears on the screen.
Ann: Oh that explains it :P
dat bad aim
than santa lands on the the roof
LOL, Fox News Derangement Syndrome! :D
FBI Aiming = Only in Amareica
Fox news is a pretty big joke in general. I know news is partisan but damn.
I fucking LOVE the music in this movie
fnds
Inb4 Spine crack
Yank news is painfully partisan sometimes. Though people take their satire too seriously sometimes.
what are you doing john
what is the second movie this night?
BYE HANZ
How the fuck to you get into that shit John
I do not get Us news...so imbalanced...
Indeed, unfortunately. Satire is practically dead thanks to nopony knowing the difference and all that...
Jump!

dat slomo
Ann, you think FOX News is partisan, try looking at CNN from a conservative point of view, or at BBC or Reuters from an Israeli point of view.
HAI FEDS
bewm
Bamf.
The BBC is pretty good for the most part.
michal bay has a orgasmim
LIKE A BOSS!
ouch
FUCK YOU GLASS
Oh yeah, I know what you mean. Canadian news is, all of it, utterly Liberal biased.
That is, without a doubt, one of the Top 10 greatest explosions in cinema history
ouch
Damn it all, I need a Twinkie now!
Glass....glass everywhere!
Thrackerzod this was the point at which Micheal Bay decided me wanted to make movies
Shiitt....
Yay! :) Ouch.
But it's still does a respectible job... most of the time, on reporting of the news.
Kandarihu: Or hevan help us, MSNBC.
And Landed on Glass... AND GLIDING On glass, FUCK ow
Where's the feds? =P
does not speak for special effects, Calcos323
kandarihu: Fox News *is* partisan. Just because other organizations are also partisan doesn't make Fox "less partisan" by compare. The only organization I'd say is arguably worse is NBC.
I realize some media where I live has some bias..but nowhere as bad as everything US I've seen...oO
Vordox: it'S not that bad, he was riding on the floormat
Kencolt, exactly. Although I hear MSNBC doesn't get a lot of ratings.
they ded
derpy_pony: What do you mean?
Vordox: There.
Aaah there it is, aye Meanwhile

00,10there went the choper
ahh fuck the FBI

lols
Expendable FEDS
this is top ten worthy?
Kandarihu: I know hard line Democrats who point and laugh at MSNBC. SERIOUSLY.
derpy_pony: There aren't very many I've seen that top it.
Fox News though really takes the right too far. to a point where they're trying to please a demographic > seriously reporting on news.
the only new i ever get is ITV and BBC and they're both alright
MSNBC is bad, but not as much as Fox
00,10seeing as it was actaly explosions and not CG yeah this was good
MSNBC is certainylu just as biased, but...ah ain't sure whether ya call it 'worse', Fox tends ta distort facts alot but yeah...ah laught at it.
Oh crap
And now tell me which "Johnson" did died?
FINALLY
Sumica: <3 Nothings beat real.
I'm not saying other news ins't biased garbage, just, not as much.
See? Sumica knows what's up.
:D
CriticKitten, the reason I didn't mention NBC isn't because they're less partisan. I just wanted to point out that CNN is partisan too.
I thought my chat was dead hard:|
WHO said ANYTHING about that sidekick being inadequate? XD
Sorry, I don't ever watch or listen to MSNBC so I can't say about that.
Inbound Final Showdown....
Why do I start these things?
please don't discuss it seriously, Calcos323
Ho ho ho!
But the reason why FOX News gets all the shame is because it leans right while ALL THE OTHERS lean left.
not in the condition for that
00,10supprise

Heres an idea shut up about the damn news already
the only news I trust nowerday are N24, but all the most viiewed are the insulting onces, RTL, Sat1, even ZDF
I've seen both news stations drop people because of their views
Lol
Dat pride smile
kandarihu: Actually it's more because Fox tends to outright lie whereas most other organizations spin and slant, but yeah.
Kandarihu but given the fact that CNN gave us foder for Fan art and all fox news did was point and laugh at us then I think Cnn is moar credible
He's been waiting all night to do that.
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNSSSSS
Haaaannnsss!!!

I'm not saying others aren't biased, I'm consertive, but Fox News takes it too far most the time.

Dis showdown.
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAANS
This chat never disappoints, lol :D
Trust me, I'd love to see more right leaning news, but I can't take Fox news seriously. Though I watch Canadian news mostly so I can't speak on a lot of Yank channells.
Kandarihu: The reason why Fox gets a ton of bashin' is because they tend ta distort facts and go way too far with it, it has nothing to do with sides. XD
Anyway, final showdown.
Lil_B: 300 % more in-depth than anything on tv

Ode to joy
dat choir
*sets speakers to the max*
00,10amazing no?
Star Wars is BEST series period
Actually, derpy_pony, I haven't >_>
That's very amazing, yes. XD
I can't hear this without thinking of Evangelion.
Hey Bronysith get your (squee) in here! STAR WARS!
I'm used to seeing Chinese ripoffs of everything.
00,10Diewars: Starsharder
there was a game on the famicom that's based on episode 4... darth vader is a boss on tatooine and he turns into a scorpion
STAR WARS!!!!
Am I the only one who doesn't like the original series that much?
3haha
FUCK YES
Pudge you are only Counting New Hope , Empire and Jedi Right?
3silly japan
stfu Freefall29
And every humans will be brothers
Yayyyy~! That'll be fun! CriticKitten: Yes, he did. And now, we wait for the credits.
Darth Hard
GarrettBrony: of course, but I still like the new ones too, just not as much
Sumica, for future reference, I'd just like to suggest that me telling anyone what to or not say, no matter how desperate I am about it, is a S3 spoiler.
ScootaChicken: No, you're not alone. :3
I just don't think they're that good films.
Bronysith: Star Wars is boss
STAR WARS TIME
/me hugs his brother, Lil_B
WAZZUP AWESOME BRONIES
Inb4 Bronysith gets into a debate with someone about the prequels not exisiting at least one point during the course of the next three nights
Ponies47: you dont say?
yay
Bronysith: :P
GarrettBrony thanks bro :)
Sumica: You mean The hidde3n fortress?
Pudge you like episodes 2 and 3 only right?
JESmith71: already happened earlier today
00,10wah huh Kandarihu?
The acting and story are all pretty boring, the only thing that really makes it special are the special effects
freude :)
The prequels DID exist.
And in this day and age they're hardly mind blowing.
They still do.
die hard???
Time for some multitasking
I really highly suggest searching for an english translation of this song
And honestly....they're not as shit as people say.
TIME FOR EPICNESS
I did it twice, and I'm very ashamed of it.
GarrettBrony: they're the better ones yeah, but i still dont see why ep 1 gets so much hate
LOL Intermission
They just weren't all that great, Now then. Intermission!
Erm...
Und dann intermission.
Intermission!! <3
yes
Oh yeah this isn't BMN. XD Thought it was Pony episode
i'm still on the credits
what is the next movie?
this is epic
If you love Star Wars. BROHOOF! /)
Star wars
You've got twenty minutes to go get drunk.
:( I miss the old Derpy intermission
It's so late here...no 30 min intermission please and on to the Star Wars!
Ponies47: (\
The first time, I threatened to speak rudely to someone over it.
/me slices Ponies47 s hand off
Intermission - gonna play some Binding of Isaac
trying to stay away here..help me
Over stuff.
Ponies47 /)*(\ JOHN WILLIAMS!
Ponies47: (\
awake, not away
Gonna get me some food! Ponies47: (/
wahtever
Pudge: Don't worry, derpy is still in this one
Ponies47: /)
Bronysith: :(
/me can honestly say he has never seen a single star wars movie in his life :/
SirGanjalf: its such an awesome game
The reason they're bad is mostly because they lack a lot of the care that went into the old ones. They focus on modern Hollywood action movie stuff and forget to make the story quality.
Hurrah
Needs more walking Derpy!!
Intermission... I'm gonna watch The Monkees!
the buffering is impossible for me to love and tolerate... i'm skipping the movie. see you guys another time
whos streaming the next movie? :p
But they aren't really "bad". Mediocre, really.
I remember waiting to get into Episode 3, and listening to people start worrying about what was going to happen, and saying no spoilers. And I was, seriously, trying not to laugh... EVERYONE knew ALREADY what was going to happen in 3, WHAT SPOILERS?
CriticKitten: SW 1-3?
I have to drop out now, I will not make it through all 3 Star Wars Movies, its 3am here
20 minutes...
Is there a 10 minute version of the next intermission, or will you reuse the old Derpy one again if you just need a shorter intermission?
Fou_Lou: Yeah.
Pudge ok imagine this. your a star wars fan in the 90's its been 16 years since Jedi. and Jar Jar Binks comes on screen. it a sense of betrayal. (Spoony style) not it is not as bad as the hate makes it out to be
3even before then people were flip-flopping back and forth on who influenced who.
Fou_Lou, there was no star wars 1-3
Is this gong to be the original Star Wars or what? Because I have the original Theatrical versions on my computer....
3man that was random
Green
Yes it was SlurryMoon yes it was :P
Dat green spam
Original one PinkieYoshi64
Dat block of green.
Lil_B: Nacht. :)
SlurryMoon, Osamu Tezuka?
SlurryMoon: I actually did know that.
CriticKitten: 1-3 werent terrible by any means no, but they just didnt live up to the original trilogy. on they're own they are solid movies
That was random indeed.
Ryunosuke At least there was no star wars Episode 1
Oh stop it. They're not horrible, they're not "betrayal" on the level of Ultima or other things.
red_ony gute nacht :)
DARING DOO AND RAINBOW DASH!!!
Ryunosuke: like this ignorance.
TALLY HO!
SlurryMoon: That's the thing, inspire, not plagiarism
uhhh
That's how the world twists
the name would be interesting now, SlurryMoon. what you say here sounds massively influential
Und dann SlurryMoon added a pasture to the chat
SlurryMoon: Actually, it didn't all come from him-- but yes, Osamu Tezuka did pioneer Japans modern Anime and Manga industries.
17 min of Criminal Minds, here I come
They're just mediocre. That's more of a crime than anything. They took a great universe and story, and made it mediocre.
midichlorians and jar jar binks, that is all :)
Daring Do, any relation to Derpy? I've been reading a fanfic about that
Well, I know that anime certainly isn't emulating the art style of Ukiyo-e.
SlurryMoon how long do you think will Star Wars take (and will be all 3 movies shown in a row?)
GarrettBrony: I mean at least it's not as bad as Saw trying to keep its storyline alive
popcorn flavourd muffinz???
17 minutes
It's just Episode 4 tonight
dinky?
shuddup: Derpy's babeh
I'm back...
Empire tonight, Jedi on Wenesday
JESmith71: yeah just ep 4
lol

A BEEEEEEEEE?
Why did she burn
if they are too bees, you are too weak
After going 3 days without smoking, I gave in
wuts this <.<
Random Question? What's your favorite Star Wars Film?
Whos wants Mt. Dew?
awww shame Calcos323
I'm not happy with myslef right now
BEES
I should see that film...what was it wickerman?
lol
GarrettBrony: I'll take one good sir
And there are certainly exceptions to both of that, but that seems to be the trend.
PinkiePieYoshi64 Empire
Calcos323: keep trying
3we're only showing the first one today, tomorrow will be ep 5 and then ep 6 on Wed
What is Friendship pony don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
WHAT IS FRIENDSHIP
Ryunosuke: Honestly? Jar Jar is terrible, but the concept of midichlorians has existed for some time. >_>
GarrettBrony: I agree completely :D
3rather the *4th* one today
/me gives everypony here a MT. DEW
And Episode 1 doesn't exist, right?
PaladinDrakkenWolf: I will. Thanks for the encouragement
Calcos323: I've been there, used to smoke.
00,10show the odd number eps this week
maybe I got it right.....star wars today?
/me takes My. Dew and pours it down the drain, yuck
And 2 and 3 are sequels to a movie that doesn't exist, and by proxy also don't exist, right?
00,10then evens next week
/me hugs GarrettBrony "OH MY GOD THANK YOU"
lol
Pudge: How in the hell did you manage to quit? Makes me want to eat babies.'
Can we have some Disney park Star Tours in here after the movies?
Kandarihu Episode 1 is just a Myth just to scare new Star wars fans
umm
3Did I successfully ninja?
Calcos323: because I only smoked like 1 or 2 a day
Yes
00,10aye
3if not, refresh your stream
kirz any word on how to make a background transparent ?
And so is Jar Jar.
Yup. During the intermission.
Pudge: That explains it
SlurryMoon: I wonder...How's te Youtube list going?
I got dieded
Anyone screaming "betrayal" at the Force-infused bacteria obviously isn't as big of a Star Wars geek as they want to sound. Because those things were established in a book in the Extended Universe before Ep 1 came out, and "Jedi scanners" existed even before then. XD
SlurryMoon: all I see is black
I'm getting a black screen.
3okay, then, let's get a going
yay yourself
there we go
I second the yay
jaej
Calcos323: only thing I'll smoke nowadays is Hooka
Who's streaming? Did Sumica switch it over to Slurry?
dafuq...
We just going to skip half the intermission? Ok then. .-.
Stur Wurs
CritcKitten: ...thank you!
Episode 1 is just a Myth. And old Creeppasta created to scare Star wars Fans

JackofApples: Return is probably not the strongest way to end the original trilogy, but all the same, yeah the Ewok bit is really kind of dumb.
Pudge what if in the next rerelease of Star wars the digitally put in Ponies
I would jizz
The colors really POP in this version.
Buffer, why?
ok...so who hasn't seen this??
madness
/me takes red_ony's Popcorn and noms "thanks" :)
it's 03:15 here and what is this?
THIS IS DEATH STAR!
Since I'm not allowed to tell people what not to explain, I expect to get in a huge political debate through at least half of the movie.
3and yes, this is the despecialized edition
Just for this film, I'm putting on my headphones... and volume's at full blast :)
BUFFER! :[
wow , lag is really horrible
NO this is STAR WARS!
madness???
The remake of Star Wars ep 4 is directed by Lauren Faust
FUN FACT: C-3PO has both the first line in the first movie ("Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor!) and the last line in the last film ("Oh, no, not again.").
wars in stars :)
No, this is Patrick
shuddup NO THIS IS STAR WARS!
Kandarihu: If you want to argue with people I'd recommend joining a debate club.
NONE CGI
derpy_pony: You're kidding, you just have to be... What is this indeed.
oh god i fucking love this. probably seen this same movie 100 times
GarrettBrony: Where's theMtn. Dew?
Everpony The Eworks did not defeat the Empire, they just distracted them! :D
for all of the shiny reflective objects in the film, they do a good job of not showing the crew
I don't argue because I like to.
Kencolt: where is picard?
and those Rebels are all just 2 days from retirement Pudge

Sumica: For the love of God, kick the ones that quote that.

STormtroopers are able to hit anyone except a character with an actual role.

Man, Darth Vader's really imposing in the opening shots. O.o
han damn shot first
Just that breathing.
/me pew pew pew
Zanon, Han did not shoot first
(Sings to the tune of the Imperial March) Here comes Darth Vader walkin' through the door, he kicked Luke Skywaler 'cross the floor
R2-D2
he's the only one who shot :)
Ryunosuke: i love you
TK-421! Why aren't you at your post?!?! >:O
Oh just because it's Star Wars
I wonder if he uses the Android OS?
I wanna meet the VA for R2-D2
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5234/
back when r2d2 didn't have rocked thrusters
Ryunosuke: Don't...mention that stupidity, I feel ashamed to be a fan when people seriously bring that up. XD
oO
WHERE ARE THE PLANS??!!
goddammit
was R2D2 cussing all the time in these movies
They surrendered? SISSIES

Hey, that's something we don't see often. A stormtrooper shoots and actually hits his target
HAHAHA Dit R2-D2 walk therE?XD
oh leia, you're so weak
i love this movie
PaladinDrakkenwolf: she has 1 settting blaster.
why is r2-d2 walking like that???
otakon: Same here.
otakon: oh okay
yh so for once it's NOT just me
00,10and the empire would have won if that guy was't so stingy with the lasers
R2D2 x C3P0
There's one! Hold your fire, there's no life form..
Fun Fact: That was captain Raymus Antilles, no relation to Wedge.
Stormtroopers hit targets all the time. Just not lead characters.
Kandarihu: to be fair, everyoen seems to have problems with imperial blasters
Kencolt: Plot Armor
sooo...how much do lazer shots cost...Just shoot the damn thing!:O
Sumica: yup... GLORY TO THE EMPIRE
Okay, random question. Why didn't they just take the ship into dock?
Sumica: Would have been a short movie.
r2-d2 does what the buck it wants
CriticKitten: what dock?
Off to get popsicles
CriticKitten: they're in the MIDDLE OF SPACE
otakon: Star Destroyers have a MASSIVE ship dock. :p
So I couldnt help but notice the rebel helmet design. Its about a quarter of a centimeter thick and its strap looks like a piece of oxy cotton taped to some velcro. Defensive quality.....
Wars IN SPACE
otakon: have i ever said how much i love these movies?
All I can think of right now is the Emerald City Comiccon radio play
otakon: For some reason, I always seem to be a minute behind the stream when certain mods stream for some reason. It could be their computers are probably running faster and better than mines.
R2-D2 is like Buck you I do what I want.
Take her away
CriticKitten:yeah and your point? they took it into the ship when they boared it.
buffer...:(
Bronysith: you don't say
Calcos323:
It seems the stun beam covered the entire width and height of the corridor. It's more of a wave than a beam. That's why the stormtrooper was able to shoot her. Missing is physically impossible.
otakon: Large enough to host a small fleet of TIEs among other things. These are supposed to be planet-surpressing forces.
Calcos323: Me too
Rebel SPAH
yh I know
The senate? PFFFTT
AttacktheAndalite:
AttacktheAndalite: When Sumica streams it usually gets way behind
Star...Bucks?

hey Sumica ...i just figured out whats going on right now...
why didn't you shoot it like I told you?! :O
night evey one
One does not simply stop Darth Vader
night Nerom
bye Nerom
Night Nerom
Bye Nerom
yh my stream is lagging out crazy
Pudge: His computer is probably running better, that's what I'm guessing. Not really sure.
Hey, everyone!
it was FINE for Die Hard
Logically said, it would make tactical sense for the stormtroopers to set their blasters to stun for ALL engagements. If they're ordered to kill, they still have their feet and fists for that.
00,10nah that comes later Bronysith
frozen?
hi Reactor
emo C3PO
3shh, if you're buffering, don't yell about it in chat

Hello Reactor
did you see the Star wars short Troops. IT HAS TOM SERVO IN IT
3if it's something I can fix, I would know about it already
O
he was almost frozen today
Hey Reactor
SlurryMoon: any chance you could turn off the ponies? That might help
otakon: Judging from that shot, no they didn't take it into dock. They just parked above it. :P
:O
I'm not buffering though
SlurryMoon: Try Popout...worked for me
3guys, the buffering is fine on my end
Sand...it's course and rough...
3therefore, it's on your end
kick*
>sand in all directions
3I can't do anything about that
Pudge: Actually, it seems to do fine when he streams a game
I have 0 buffering :/
they actually shot on location for these films. they traveled the fucking world to film theese. THATS one of the main reasons i love these films
>"this way is much safer"
So much sand.
yeah that helps NOTHING
Beep boop beep
AttacktheAndalite: heck no, the chat and stream are always off by like 10 seconds
Comb the desert

And all the Clone Troopers are CGI.
I'd hate to meet the thing that left behind that skeleton!
Oh look, more sand.
Bronysith: Or that :D
DRAGON
dat skeleton
The same reason I like LOTR: So little Green screens
Krayt Dragon
looks like a dragon skeleton
D: The Krayt Dragon bones! 8D Yay!
CGI doesnt work all the time. it worked well in terminator 2
3but, fine, I'll turn off the desktop ponies if you insist
glowing eyes
a krayt dragon skeleton to be exact
It is a Dragon Skeleton :D
Vordox LOTR so little Greens Screens SO much New Zealand
SlurryMoon: THANK YOU

if your gettling lag just refresh your stream
Pudge: *you're

Sumica: yh your stream was fine, but as soon as Slurry started streaming not only did the stream start lagging every few seconds but the lightIRC wouldn't work either.

*whine whine*
00,10seeing as it's freaking binary
/me moisturizes Sumica
NOOO! Take R2!
What I explained to my mom is that this movie has all the adjustments that made the Special Edition better, without the CGI and other nonsense that made the Special Edition worse. Is that the right way to say it?
Sumica: Load lifters prefer using 1 and 2.
Luke , what a Joker
boom

FUCKING BOOM
00,10great, now I am all wet Bronysith

BaconMane: How was it? I heard it wasn't that good.
/me is gay for young mark hamill
Nittany_Discord explodes even when his motivator is in good shape
GarrettBrony, then R2D2 and C3P0 would be separated forever.

00,10Twilight could do all of those things

Calco323 you could pick up a lot of chicks with that
3a bit too much to drink...
ponibas, Alright, Same song! Here we go!
/me force punches otakon through the internet
Lil_B: the big gun one of them was holding was a slightly remodeled mg3
Otakon I was quoting that video with Billy West, Tara, and all those other guys doing some of the lines from this
satan drinks here
05why does everythign in this movie look so much more... reall?
Kandarihu, 75% offa waht.. it's free?
Racists!
Wrek: cause it is
Wrek: Because it's not CGI?
Wrek: Because it is.
Wrek: cause everything is organic man
werewolf, satan & buttheads
11,01Wrek: Puppets.
Wrek: bc physical effects and NO CG
Wrek: I dunno... Maybe it's the clothes.
Dark_Horst oh Oo
otakon, all well for texas, im way far north
11,01And people in costumes.
CriticKitten: I agree. But does that count for the nonexisting prequels too. because i said basically something shown in those
11,01It's not computers.
Because CGI didn't exist in he 70s
Greedo!
there was no cgi back then
no droids alowed :/
Calcos323 you could pick up a lot of Women like that
CHEWIE!
Less CGI
Technophobes~!
evil monkey!
00,10cause it's not filtered 50 ways and covered in cg remakes
Wrek because gorge is a god
the BEST Bacca
also, friendly Lizardman
08,01Wrek: basically what sumica said
Fun Fact: there are less models in the whole original trilogy than in Phantom Menace.
wolf man o_o
blargle blarg
goddammit MIPS WORK RIGH!
Durro's
Wrek: there is no green/blue screen
Wrek: Cause this is MS paint, and not Sai. ;)
even the ships n all were small models ect
He doesn't like you. D:<
He doesn't like you...:O
08,01also, because SlurryMoon's encoding settings are awesome

There was a Lego Star Wars special on CN that was a comedic take on this where 3PO snuck in to the place

SlurryMoon: I'm mostly polish
>arm cut off, >continue
sup chewie
When I see this scene all I can think of is all the bounties that would have showed up on the boards in Star Wars Galaxies XD
I find the lack of macroblocking in this impressive. And I've seen quite a lot of macroblocking on this stream before.
amount of fucks give
0
...and let's go right back to normal! :D
Eulshy: I've tried, it's the servers atm
notohing to see here folks! Keep playing the music....
Fun fact: the blood actually shouldn't be there. Lightsabers supposedly cauterize any wounds they inflict, so there shouldn't be blood. Still, I love that scene. :P
What about Irish? I'm half Irish :P
PARTY SOFT
More cantina song yay!

parsecs are a distance not a speed
PaladinDrakkenwolf: oh really?
11,01Lol. Parsecs is a distance measurement.
sumica, it is
Sumica: Yes.
Sumica, yes
Sumica: yup
too bad parsec is not a time value
Sumica distance
I challenge you PaladinDrakkenwolf to fisticuffs
Sumica: eeyup
Sumica yup
Family Guy joke. Again.
GarrettBrony, Coincidence? Or a clever disguise...
No it's the Titianium Turkey

They explain that away in one of the Extended Universe books actually.
Bronysith: okay hold your fists up to the screen
I'm half Israeli, technically that makes me Jewish. From my mother's side, I guess I'm a mix of several European descent. I'm a decent chunk Irish.

GabeMoist: you're*
Sumica: I read somewhere that the Kessel Run is through this giant space of black holes that ships have to zigzag around, and the reason he said that was because he found a shorter route.

Ok I'm back :3
