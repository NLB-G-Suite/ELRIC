That term refers to Japanese animation.

somehwat. it's a bit laggy
The term is generally used to refer to animation of a Japanese origin, which ponies are not. :p
Word usageIn Japan, the term anime does not specify an animation's nation of origin or style; instead, it serves as a blanket term to refer to all forms of animation from around the world.[17][18] English-language dictionaries define anime as "a Japanese style of motion-picture animation" or as "a style of animation developed in Japan

i even expanded my cable package just to get the hub
oh sorry
I'm here
Well this is a first. It's thundering at the end of winter.
/me falls asleep on TopHat's shoulder

Well, I can, but I like it here
yeah. I just know it as a possibility. I don't know the rules of McD
All you have to do is asking them if they'd be willing to sell some of their toys
Umm
Hi?
i plan on getting a couple of sets of the toys, one for myself, and possibly sell a set or two as a collection
Oh my
Don't stop me noooowwwww
I have a McD's within walking distance >.>

The closes McDonalds is a 600 kilometers drive from where I live
i would probably buy both the transformers and ponies because theyre both relevent to me.

Whatever.

My nearest mcdonalds is a five minute walk
The thing is, I prefer food over McDonald's

11,01Tornado sirens?
/me 11,01checks SPC.
If it's tornado sirens you might want to consider taking cover somewhere. Just a suggestion
11,01Why would you have a siren for regular thunderstorms?
Quite odd
you dont have a siren for when weather is getting severe?
11,01State College doesn't have sirens period.
11,01Even though we can get tornadoes. We're just not tornado-prone.
:3
11,01Even then, you should keep one on.
Yep
nopony makes a taco like meicans and i should know
YES,
Just the sound of it just makes me nervous and I start to shake. I dont know why.
11,01Because warning sirens usually go off for tornado warnings.
0,14I'd like to be near a tornado
Not the tornados.
0,14like, see one in person
The sound of that emergency broadcast system.
11,01And that one I think was max-rated.

FUCK.
Pardon my language.

Even if it doesn't that means the torture wouldn't stop.

I have no idea why I instantly thought of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1JG4cycd4w
*smacks everypony on the forehead* You could have had a V8! :P Like Me :)
0,14so the few female players that do play get shit flung their way to no end

whoa now. I know gawker sites have gone way downhill, but its my source of gaming news
WOO
do none of the mods want to stream right now?
They play a few rounds of MW3 and think there gamers
http://kotaku.com/5888979/witness-the-gloriously-annoying-marriage-of-ocarina-of-time-and-my-little-pony I still can't believe they posted that
11,01I only want to play online games with friends now.
That's whot those sites do. They post shit to piss people off and gain more views, and thus more ad revenue.
>.>
1,3sorry, had to play that card for the fun of it <3
Gamer Girls may have been pretty uncommon 20 years ago, but nowadays, there's TONS of femals gamers. And people need to stop acting like they aren't there, or that they should be objectified.
I concur
0,14I know XD
0_0 dem posts
All in that same second :D
I know female geeks irl
0,14I don't usually get too bent out of shape, but when I feel really passionate about certain things
wow, you really mean it? Alright. I won't post them...
That deserves a top story?
0,14I can get carried away

I reaaaally dislike Power Girl.

OMG.
NICE
1,3I believe Power Girl is one of the New52 getting the axe
aww gtg :( night
screw it
0,14well, I generally can't hold my combos, but yeah, i was nervous too
Read Animal Man's New52. It's pretty darn good.
0,14it was in loser's brackets
http://images.wikia.com/superman/images/f/f2/Power_Girl.jpg
night everypony
Aw Saxy. MOAR LUCK THIS YEAR!
I'm going to sleep
Power Girl can actually be interesting when she's got a decen writer behind her, but yeah, her costume is completely shameless fanservice. WHY DOES SHE NEED A CLEAVAGE WINDOW?
^-^
0,14XD
lol night nows
1,3that reminds me, I need to stop by the comic store tomorrow :)
I'm usually skeptical about fanservice in my entertainment
0,14I haven't read comics in aaaages
I don't mind fanservice
But too much breaks it
fanservice is best service
I could lend you one of mine, Saxy.
i demand more derpy ducreux pics about pony songs ~
Animal Man New52.
http://warpout.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Barier-287555713 Is still an awesome pic. I'm sorry. Were you guys saying something?
1,3fanservice with no substance, fastest way to turn me off of a series/game/comic/person/etc
^
Fanservice CAN be done well. I think that One Piece generally pulls it off well, though it can be distracting. And GTO did a fantastic job of making the fanservice comical and part of the plot.
Fanservice reminds me that I'm an animal with basic instincts.
But generally in comic books, you get tons of upskirt and bondage shots for females.
1,3glitter's nice to look at, but doesn't do much for you at the end of the day
This is why the anime club at my high school was crap.
fave character
Onizuka is Best Teacher
For me, One Piece wins over Bleach and Naruto
FRANKY!
^^^
Oh, And GTO
Yes <3
I really need to watch more anime
LOL
I don't know. I never really bothered with any of those anime series
0,14oh right
And how many episodes of Bleach are there /sigh
0,14Kubooooooooo
http://i.imgur.com/Yj2XM.png
I don't like reading.
I cant remember...
Is it wierd that I only watch english dubs?
I mean the anime
The One Piece anime had filler, but it was entertaining
G8, for one
G8?
It's after Skypiea
You're right
lol
Hey applejack, which year?

My bad~
Especially the stock screams in their. And that guitar riff!
See, we Canadians got a different opening song

Gintama is hilarious

?
that one?
^
o.o well... F:NV just creeped me out...
Gintama parodied Slumdog Millionaire brilliantly yesterday.
I only WATCH the anime not read them
i read and watch
I hate manga for some reason
I prefer to read the manga. Sometimes I'll watch the anime, but with long running titles, I dent to opt for the source material.
Good night LC
I'm currently trying to get through Skip Beat
/me hugs everypony. Goodnight!
I've heard good things about Skip Beat
Me too
Bleach is waaaay too long
does anyone know how long it takes that confirm thing to come through from paypal?
Bleach is actually longer than dbz i believe
The way Bleach is drawn, I'm able to tear through each chapter like a flipbook
One Piece is probably going to be twice as long as Dragonball
Probably being the keyword here
One Piece take like 10 minutes to read each chapter.

well, wants to
13but i have reason this time
The worst anime I have ever seen is Girls Bravo
13ACTIVITY ON THE BALDURS GATE WEBSITE
QWAT!?
:P
Aw. I loved Girls Bravo
/me puts on a tinfoil hat
It had way to much fanservice and cliches
Okay, that is reason enough for it
13no apparently this is very very recent

/me Justice League Doom was pretty good
I missed it
13like within hours recent
oh woah

Okay

/me and queen's blade
INCOMING TEXT WALL FROM THE SOURCE OF BAULDERS GATE WEBSITE
/me doesnt watch anime anymore cause its all the same and BORING... for the most part...
I liked Queens Blade only for the character that shot acid out of her tits
13my body can't even handle it right now
0,14I know
boulders gate really ?
Anime is only a medium for many genres of entertainment to be portrayed
dem innuendos
:( Towa no Quon has ended.
it's PAINFUL
I know
that why i liked Queen's Blade... unnessecary pantshots .///.
I couldn't even get through the FIRST EPISODE
/me loves Zero No tsukiama
and Iw as like "hmm, this could be good"
but I was HORRIBLY wrong
0,14well, I'm still relatively immature, but not to the extent I was ages ago
have to go guys
/me manyuu hikenchou is neat
bye bye
And it was only the first episode
I'm genuinely skeptical when it comes to gratuitous fanservice in my animes :)
yeah
/me ....maybe....
it's WEIRD

13AD&D rules were pretty dumb
another manga with way too much fanservice (or rather, Manwha): Ragnarok
13getting a 3.5e baldurs gate would be great
D&D 3.5 is apparently best, but i never played that version
