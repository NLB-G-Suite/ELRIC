Totally forgot about my Science Fair tomorrow

DeadlyDerp3: Yous hould be greatful. Without japanise, NO PONIES.
Im not a big anime fan
...When does his bike ever get involved with a fight?
:);):D:(:O
I WAS KIDDING
Jeeezz
Meeplord: Ponies are anime
brb
ik
Kamen Rider is a TOkusatsu series based on works by Ishinomori. It's now quite the same as Super Sentai, adapted here as Power Rangers.
Its bout the only anime I watch
Dken2021: The style of ponies is anime
Scrooge Mcduck Inspired the creator of Astro Boy
pull my finger
<PinkiePieCopy> Meeplord: Ponies are anime <--- lolno
Used to watch Naruto LONG time ago
He was drawing tentacle hentai :P
OH SNAP< WENT THERE
/me falcon PAWNCHes CriticKitten
lol
Don't correct me. I'm right and you celestiadamn know it.
hehe
Another furry
...Holy CRAP.
lol falco
Except you're not
wtf
I am
BIRRRRRRRRRRRD
and then big bird mosnter
That term refers to Japanese animation.
Actually, from a Japanese perspective, all animation is Anime.
OHAI Mutant!
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
Ponies are not Japanese.
dat backround face
...I don't see anything
09,01this show, a furry holocaust?
all the homies say ho and the girlies wanna scream
They use the STYLe of anime
That's irrelevant.
"Bwwwl"
By your logic, Avatar is anime too. >_>
Avatar is an anime
"Huh? Let me paint that, QUICK"
BIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRD
(and before you say it, no, it's not anime either)
Avatar, THE LAST AIRBENDER.
YEAHHH
"AAAAeeee"
where is gonzilla when we need him
/me punches CriticKitten
aaaarglblblblblbl
The light, it burns!
That's just silly :P
By your logic, nothing is anime
lolwrong
Actually, Tezuka, was more influenced in his style with earlier Disney works.
OKAY GUYS
Let's just agree anime is awesome :P
but without DISNEY, anime wouldn't exist
anime is anime. 6_9
CriticKitten: Ponies use a remix of anime, or manga.
...and the guy with the tissue robes is right
You're not getting it.
Kencolt:
The style is irrelevant.
mfw you can only take pictures for gamerpics with classic cam :[
The location is.
anyone else buffering horribly?
Pshhh
Anime is a type of drawing
so is manga
I am-- buffering on this episode seems to be rather ahrsh.
somehwat. it's a bit laggy
am i the only one who finds this hilarious
You do not get it CriticKitten
The term is generally used to refer to animation of a Japanese origin, which ponies are not. :p
RoboGerbil: a couple lag here and there...
Kencolt: same here.
/me punches CriticKitten
SHUT UP
No, you're using the fancy art terminology rather than the normal person terminology.
Word usageIn Japan, the term anime does not specify an animation's nation of origin or style; instead, it serves as a blanket term to refer to all forms of animation from around the world.[17][18] English-language dictionaries define anime as "a Japanese style of motion-picture animation" or as "a style of animation developed in Japan
except the giant Eagle right there, No nothing suspicous
he was dressed as a eagle
We do not need adictionary
We need
PONIES
lol no reporter would say monster on tv
Although Aniime styles wander ALL OVER THE PLACE, so trying to define it stylistically is implausible.
Regardless, I'm curious where the Japanese style of art is present in ponies, myself.
whats this now?
"AAAH"
bronies im new to this. in 2 days and 23 hours will be new MLP episode ?
So the furry eagle is a Disney Representative?
no friday movie night
no new episode for 2 weeks
no just friday stream
Trying to elimenate Japan?
In their eyes, CriticKitten
Last I looked, it was pretty much based around ordinary Flash-style artwork.
Shisno-brony: new episode on Saturday.
here comes the pervert kidnapper
WHO CARES
Well, this ain't stupid :P
Zappy: yeah i thought so too
/me is back from his after skool nap
PinkiePieCopy: But the style of the eyes was borrowed from a disney cartoon.
jffry890: i think you've got your weeks confused, the ponyless weekend is over and ther will be an episode this saturday
Therefor it is not anime
You'll have to explain that, since the eyes do NOT remind me of anime and I watch quite a bit of that.
Hello Kipkat07. Had a nice nap?
........................................ANIME IS DISNEY, AND DISNEY IS ANIME
damn this looks like porn
eeyup
/me is now away - Reason : Auto-Away after 30 minutes
just got dafuq is this
09,01...who gives a shit. Animation is animation.
Unless you intend to argue that expressive eyes are anime.
:p
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3abMUH_P1E&feature=player_detailpage is my reaction to CriticKitten and I's argument
Well, this is just getting STUPID
DCD: Agreed, personally.
lol furry fight
09,01"Anime" is a shortened way of saying "Animation". SO YEAH.
eeyup
Well, that was fast
My reaction to this whole conversation about Anime http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3y3QoFnqZc
nice computers
ill be back later
state of the art right there
Nice to include the evil organ player in the back there :P
PinkiePieCopy: You really need to chill
Back
CriticKitten: NewBLACK said anime is short for animation, making MLP an animation
Argument won
Do I need to say it? SCIENCE.
You don't need to say hello to the victim
we brought the girl for our bukakke fest
You're getting offended over a simple disagreement.
It's kind of childish.
Explain how i'm offended
Godzira?
Relax and just have fun with it. :p
That organs gettin annoyin
lol
ROFL
Playing missle comand in the background :P
Wasn't aware we were arguing. Pretty sure I was discussing how the term is generally used, I dunno what you were doing but I was just enjoying a discussion.
hes got LSD?
DeadlyDerp3: Missle command is awesome
pillz here
DeadlyDerp3: I could spend 10 hours on missle command
Supa Computa!
I was afk for a bit.. what's going on??
CriticKitten: I SHALL PROOVE I WON THIS VIDEO WITH A PONYMON BATTLE
...Why does he need to kidnap people who would volunteer for this?!
WHOS THAT PONYMON
and with a falcon, no less!
ITS :[
now thats a high def tv, oh wait its just displaying text
See, perhaps that's the problem.
is this japanese Johnny 5 is alive?
this movie just :D
because it amuses him DeadlyDerp3
You're overly concerned about "winning" an opinionated discussion on IRC.
...Well, it amuses me...by making me cry in hate :(
Just chill, bro. :p
"dwaaaaaahhaa"
I still want a ponymon battle
XD

I like special things~
....but first I need to get these stupid finals printed out.
yay wet tshirt contest
Yeah, How to kill yourself, go into the water, BRILLIANT
Drawfriend!!
RoboGerbil: What good will a wet t-shirt contest do when ponies are wearing t-shirts?
why then.. does she have a sticking plaster on her head
who said anyhting about ponies, critickitten, i was commenting on the feed
Historically, drowning yourself was a popuar way to commit suicide in Japan, since for centuries most Japanese did not know how to swim. True history!
Pft.
oh it's gone.. I swear she had one
She was only in the water for a few minutes
But my comment was better when you assumed it was ponies.
It meant that people were making mental pictures of Twi in a wet t-shirt.
(have fun with that one!)
Screw the girl! I have money!
/me is back
that was a tiny drawfriend
whats this?
I

The first Kamen Rider was-- literally-- about a guy kidnapped a World Conquering Evil Organization (tm) and turned into a super cyborg by infusing him with grasshopper genes, who escaped and fought them. And all Riders have motorcycles, by the way.

Dken2021: yeah...sounds like they are finally running out of colors

I hope Black and White 2 is a sequel and you get to play as N (a character who is clearly high-functioning autistic and must be censored)
and for some reason black kyurem and white kyurem are separate pokemon and not forms
today has been derpy :P
ohai there OneTrickPony
I haven't really followed Pokemon after gold/silver, were they any good after that?
ohai OneTrickPony
hai derr Dken2021 and Jim

Derpy should sing a pony version of the Humpty Dance.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk&feature=related
Jim: to my knowledge, up to black and white thye were good, black and white had crappy pokemon but apparently a really good story
3rd gen changed the game engine a little, 4th gen changed it alot (and was slow), and 5th gen changed the pacing of the story
Jim. If you're in to battling, then the game is better than ever. If you only care about the story, then No.

Filthy, scummy HIPSTERS.
obvi
I guess that makes more sense
lol Hipsters
My responce to Derpy being cancelled: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WRXcqLufmI&feature=related
Fun Fact, Being hipster is conformist. WHAT NOW!!
When being hipster becomes mainstream, what's a hipster?
fun fact: the stamps in Isreal are 100% kosher
Exactly
a neo hipster
thats just being ironic
I find it funny that so many people wear those big hipster glasses without the lenses to look cool.
Yeah that is always hilarious to watch
lol I wear those as a joke
Sucks for them because then you can poke em in the eyes easier for being so stupid.
i like hipsters. they stand for originality
00,03I know this band called Santana. You probably never heard of them~
I'm so hipster that I am conformist of irony alone
T_T
I walk around with them and make hipster jokes all day
indie rock?
Hipster jokes are fun ^^
Hipsters are fine.
"What if majority of bronies are just hipsters and only watching the show ironically?"
The kid I like wears hipster-esque glasses. But he actually needs them to SEE.
i liek hipsters
so a hipster walks into a bar... but then walks straight out when everyone already knows about it
lool
I burned my tongue today; I ate my soup before it was cool
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
LadyCanary: do you like like him?
looo

Get it?
i cant believe it
Wouldnt go that far, mario_pony. Too early to tell.
Kipkat07: Wait wait wait... you mean that there are people who DON'T like MLP?
Hipsters move into black neighborhoods then cause the rent to go up because they're white. Urban Gentrification, ftl.
watttttttttttttttt
LadyCanary: lol
anyone interest in dota2 livestream?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVmmYMwFj1I Here's a song about hipsters.
so...people did i miss anything?
Hi DeadpoolDash! Not really I dont think.
not much DeadpoolDash
I didnt have to even try and i caught my brother watching mlp today lol
Gentrification and urban gentrification refer to the changes that result when wealthier people ("gentry") acquire or rent property in low income and working class communities.

It's called a big ego

She's alright I guess

and she has a hard time fitting in
Firefox quit on me.
I'd be happy to see Trixie return but it's a little contrived for her to be Luna's apprentice, isn't it?
Trixie should come back in one episode and make Derpy "derpy" again
CCCP: yes
So if those things pop-up, that's bad?
CCCP: just yes
:)
magic powerz that cause eye derp
hello everypony
And then she goes back in time with the doctor
ohai valoreins

Polydunami: not really, I wouldn't be surprised in Luna's ignorance of Trixie that she doesn't know that she has a thing against Twilight.

/me growls at mario_pony "be scared! hes my man!"
Hey herostar, /)
Hey RAWRity
MahBoi777 how ish you?
So, somebody over on a brony FB group brought up a rather interesting idea about the whole "derpygate" thing.
GOOD, u?
...gate?
I have converted one friend and my girlfriend, and it was hard. Good job.
derpygate?
Polydunami /)(\ it connects
flutter_spin: akin to watergate

I tried to Convert my friend. FAiled. what should i say/ do to him?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRvZvBCRyI
lol
bout derpy, just be happy that hasbros only editing one ep...
NOONE TAKES MAH FOOD:|
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: well, I'm sure it's porbably been brought up already, but the problem some may have had migth have been because of RD's dialogue.
LadyCanary: Is "derp" even a verb?
airin6ixx: Son, I am dissaspoint
/me is disgusted by mario_pony " TopHat will you take care of that lil filly for me"
Placebo: Derp can be anything.
It can be.
Placebo: yes it is!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtKlSy1O5GY What did I just find?
Derp has no boundaries.
I derp, you derp, he/she derps
airin6ixx, whatever you do, do NOT force it on your friend
/me giggles like a mad man
/me runs like hell
6_9
Derp is unbridled potential.
I want a Derping cutie mark.
RAWRity the way she said it perhaps ? ~
derpy can see into your mind!
Placebo: it will be in the form of a censor bar
/me throws a star at mario_pony
/me throws the remote at mario_pony
Terry Crews has less boundaries than Derpy.
*troll face*
Derpy can see into your SOUL!
or just the dialogue as a whole ?
/me throws MahBoi777 at mario_pony
/me catches the star
/me dodges
derpy can see into your soul!
/me wonders where my star is
u cannot dodge me, I am huge
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: eeyup. While I disagree, the way RD's dialogue was delivered, it could be interpreted that she was in some way "bullying" Derpy.
My atempt on my friend failed. I guess ill try my GF
TopHat: are you not gonna take care of mario_pony for your special somepony?
im on a phone its a miracle im even typing this fast...
I did
I threw the remote
Maybe you're just a boss siriwlliam
YO DUKEY! pick up da phone!
0,14jeez, this chat is moving quick
/me steals remote
very quickly
Hey, thats as much as a man can do
So much action between filly, TopHat, and mario
Faster than the speed of poni
interesting~ yet unlikely ~
personally, I just see it as somebody who knows how Derpy is, and RD just not being the most patient of ponies, but I can understand how somebody might come to that conclusion.
Nopony drops anvils like Derpy
it helps that im on a good phone with a qwerty keyboard
The science show.
but now you have to go get it...wait i get to see you walk away... ok go ahead and throw everything at him and get our stuffs back TopHat
TopHat: now i have a remote
..... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bxTWWl2g5Q&feature=channel Where have you been? I'm moving that link upfront!
If only all of the idiotic parents that complained about Derpy shared your thoughts RAWRity.
Jim: oh i get it, cuz Drops a piano on Twilight!
Guys im scared its storming
^^
/me pushes in a cart of weapons
these are here if u need em
a storm is near me too...
What kind of storm Gunthler? The power might go out for me because of an ice storm
hey TopHat can Gunthler come sit with us so he isnt scared?
/me has another remote
/me wonders where his weapons went
sure
*troll face*
/me has 1-ups
Gunthler: you'll be okay, you might want to turn off your computer though and get to a enclosed area is all.
There's a storm a-brewin'. And it's comin' on strong and fast.
That calm Chrono Cross music
/me scoots over and pats the seat next to her "come over here Gunthler youll be safe"
0,14I liek storms :3
in the event of a power outage i can stay on the irc for another 4 hours
There's a shit storm a-brewin'.
I'm a storm person myself
/me plays song of storms
/me has back up ak-47
I don't always hide under the couch with a football helmet on. But when I do, it's during a storm.
lol flutter_spin not going to be able to go to sleep tonight =D
Chrono Cross helped me survive a week-long RV cross-country trip with my family
I perfer the rain when it comes to storms. Rain and snow but no more than that.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs-SxiWXS8Y reading MLD just became awesome.
chrono trigger helped me survive 2 weeks wirhout internet
If it wasn't for Chrono Cross, that trip would have killed me
siiiiingin in the rain, yes siiiiingin in the rain
Tovelr: It was already awesome, best peice of literature ive ever read
How much more awesome Tovler? 20% more awesome I think
Chocolate rain.
I'm gonna adopt the shit out of a dog now!
Pinkie pie approves.
Chocolate rain. Some stay dry while other lose the game.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFf
some stay dry and others feel the pain chocolate rain!
Jim: What game
I have a dog at the foot of my chair <3
Jim: Damn you.
0,14I wish I had a dog ;___;

SaxyPretender: i have 3, i would offer you one, but i'm kind of stuck with them
I have a giant turkey leg at my feet
0,14awww
MahBoi777: Shouldn't you have two?
/me wonders where all his crap is going
Why did you cut off Scootaloo's leg MahBoi777?
what's going on, I was distracted
I ATE THE OTHER ONE TT_TT
:o
Wrong birdie
/me wants a hedgehog. Or a bunny.
Jim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGEolh4BrWY
FLUTTERSHY IS BEST THING
0,14also, I probably wouldn't be able to take them, I live in an apartment and am kinda allergic to dogs ;________;
Scootaloo is a chicken, not a turkey
I want a pony..
My cat came to say hi. I'm a bit distracted right now.
Oh wait.
I have one :D
^^
SaxyPretender: FACEHOOF
He said turkey? Whoops :P
i put my twilight blindbag figure on my kitchen carousel...
Jim: :D
LOL
TWILIGHT? awwwww... that's the one I didn't get
/me falls asleep on TopHat's shoulder
:)
I got the other 4. Applejack doesn't have a hat. Not the same.
my twilight and pinklestia rest over my xbox ~ next to MCdonals AJ
/me daaaaaws at the adorableness
:'( i havent been able to get any of the mane 6 blindbags yet
and thats the ONLY figure i got
Im kind of new here, what does the "TIL THE FRIDAY STREAM" countdown?
i do have 4 background ponies though
/me doesn't own any pony merchandise. I probably should fix that...
/me hopes fillyfillyy is a girl and TopHat is a guy, or its gonna be kinda awkward
I went to Toys R Us and cheated. I looked at the codes. Surprisingly I got 4.
Friday move night airin6ixx
/me hugs Fillyfillyy
IngloriousPony89: McDonalds is going to have MLP toys this coming month ;3
I require more pony merchandise myself
TheHoodyninja: well i guess it just got awkward
TheHoodyninja: they are both guys
same, but i went to my walmart and got mine
0,14airin6ixx, the countdown is until our Brony Movie Night
hey there RainbowJack
TheHoodyninja: but they are role playing
To bad I dont eat at McDonalds Placebo. At all.
13is not
Who says you need to eat their food? >.>
13IT'S A BOMB
http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/11/1/47abf22e-554b-4ef4-b701-ca1e703e5d98.jpg I could have gotten the 12set, but $25 was steep
ummm RainbowJack im kinda with my wifu right now
I has a gay cousin, im cool with anything
guys how do i know if its tornado weather, thats what im fearing :(
IngloriousPony89: maybe you could just go in and just buy the toys?
aahhh
Gunthler, where do you live?
I can't disarm it!
MO
Oh
$1.75 for just the toy
simply tab into weather.com...
really close to the Kansas state line
Just wondering, I know nothing about tornado weather
mario_pony: You can actually get just the toy without buying anything else?
Gunthler: Well if you look outside youll see a giant black spinning funnel, thats when you run
hey TopHat meet my friend RainbowJack
In the meal I mean
youll be good if anything ugly comes up
IngloriousPony89: yep i think
IngloriousPony89: yes
0,14storms? that's definately Nittany_Discord's territory
yeah, when the toys are released at mcdonalds, i will be buying several of each one
we're going to watch raiders of the lost ark at friday ^^
Polydunami: allow me to explain *ahem*
hello RainbowJack
No need
And MACHETE! God I cant freakin' wait!!
Reallly
But I think you can only buy max 2 per day
hello there tophat
Best. Move night. EVER!
Polydunami: I insist
umm RJ he isnt just tophat he is TopHat
That's ok, they are releasing 2 per cycle
Don't
I hate it when my chat derps
Tornadoes occur when cold dry air moves above warm moist air. Cold air is more dense than warm air so the cold air drops and the warm air rises. The cold air falling is similar to the water in the bathtub draining.
tophat is just a hat TopHat is TopHat
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rB9MENyufkc/T0v1Fy2OeTI/AAAAAAAAgx4/NIGRH08t51E/s1600/1.JPG
TopHat sorry i just woke uo and its 5:30 here
use mirc ?
that toy rstriction, pricing, and other toy factors very wildly across different mcds
It creates a cyclone effect. Tremendous volumes of hot and cold air equalizing creates tremendous winds.That is a pretty unscientific answer.
11:30 here
well ok, http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/more-in-depth-look-from-canadian.html is a better link
Well my laptops about to lose power and the charger wont work right now so good night everyone
gnight TheHoodyninja
/me passes out
wow that sucks gnite
Goodnight TheHoodyninja
night TheHoodyninja
As far as I know, MLP only airs on TreehouseTV in Canada
We don't get The Hub
kitty! :_)
EGAD
I don't have the hub over here either
was TOY_PON32 on today or last night?
i just got the hub at my house.
flutter_spin: i worked at a mcdonalds for about 3.5 years some time ago and i never heard that we could only sell a certain amount of toys per day to a person
i can get the hub but my mom doesn't want to !
/me shrugpony
nope TT_TT
/me hugs Jim "me 2"
Sry Ing. It might only be if the toy is popular...
And I don't really think TreehouseTV is a very good network if it has to censor the word 'loser' in its shows
sirwilliam: luvky
lol, well flutter_spin with the mlp toys, you can bet they'll be quite popular
sirwilliam: *lucky
i even expanded my cable package just to get the hub
oh sorry
I'm here
Well this is a first. It's thundering at the end of winter.
My mom was a manager at Mcdonalds. She told me they had to limit the toy selling sometimes
/me falls asleep on TopHat's shoulder
my bulldog be chewin on mah foot......I've taught you well.
sirwilliam: we have to do that too it's just my dosn't want to pay more
scaredddd
you did that
i could get the hub, but its an extra $8 a month for me, and money isnt something i have a ton of, not to mention i dont get to pick which episodes i want to watch on tv
Dang it, I live in Vancouver where most of the cast is based. We should at least have The Hub as an option
:l
hello Gunthler
i did it because im in charge of cable at my house
Just watch on bronystate :P or when Xyro uploads 1080p
sirwilliam: seriously why?
That's what I'm doing nowadays
flutter_spin: could very well be, but, if i go in early in the morning during breakfast time, then go back in after my classes are all finished at around 4:30, i doubt they'll know its me
/me snores really loud on TopHat s ear
he who has the remote controls all
I ate to much ;.;
O_o
i live with a brother and friend
loud
The great holder of the remote control is all mighty
sirwilliam: lucky
I'm here on BronyState because I can't watch the new episodes live anywhere else
and its mcdonalds, theres far too many of them around as is, i can always go to one thats probably at most, a mile away
Well, I can, but I like it here
so we call the shots together
yeah. I just know it as a possibility. I don't know the rules of McD
All you have to do is asking them if they'd be willing to sell some of their toys
/me hugs Polydunami
Umm
Hi?
/me hugs RainbowJack back
Where do you live Ingwaz? The closest McDonalds here is 15 miles away
i plan on getting a couple of sets of the toys, one for myself, and possibly sell a set or two as a collection
Oh my
Don't stop me noooowwwww
(dreams of TopHat having enough gentlycoltly courtisy as to take me up to a bed so im not sleeping on the couch but of course its just a dream)
I have a McD's within walking distance >.>
So were talking about the mcdonalds toys then?
Eeyup
MahBoi777, that reminds me of a genius movie
Friday, yeah?
IngloriousPony89: i prefer not to say generally, but i know theres a mcdonalds a few miles from my university, and another one maybe 8 mintues away from that one
oh god that creepy guy from that show CDC was showing us is still in my screen
The closes McDonalds is a 600 kilometers drive from where I live
Placebo: u lucky boi
i would probably buy both the transformers and ponies because theyre both relevent to me.
Frideh, Frideh, gotta get down on Frideh
/me carries fillyfillyy up to HER bed

o3o
>saxy music
Randomnerd: its not friday
Ingwaz: so they're out now?
...Ohhh myyyy Placebo.
Randomnerd: what? when did i say that?
I drive to work. I pass 3 McDonalds. It is a 10minute drive.
(\/) (o,,,,o) (\/)
Don't look!
The closest Mickey D's to where I live is about 2-3km away
/me covers LadyCanary's eye
Maybe 4km
And I don't give a damn
Whatever.
THE HORROR
I'll get 'em next week.
/me stirs in TopHat s arms but doesnt wake up
there are no mcdonalds near where i live, but i go to uni 5 days a week, so i can get it before or after class
My nearest mcdonalds is a five minute walk
The thing is, I prefer food over McDonald's
hey Cupcakeman
i dislike mcdonalds...
hey guys, im recording for youtube. can anyone do a livestream soon?
Actually, I remember having their fries in China
their food is generally disgusting
/me sincker "oh boy TopHat Fillyfillyy seems to be asleep
They were not greasy in the slightest
That one McDonalds is probably the only one within a 40 mile radius. Jesus, I really do live in the middle of nowhere :P
brb gotta help mom with her homework
I dont think mcdonalds is even food
^
odd chat for a video for youtube.. perhaps i was unheard?
Its probably just sewage
IngloriousPony89: i live in a pretty small town area myself, i just go to a university in a slightly more populated town
it's not, it's genetically modified
Hey herostar, give it your best shot
herostar: We don't usually have stream going right now. Mostly we talk about random stuff, like the McD MLP set
GUYS SAY HI TO YOUTUBE
genetically modified sewage
Hi guys
I'm reminded of the Spongebob episode where the Krusty Krab is bought out by a big corporation who "improve" the resturant CupcakeWarrior
SWEEET storm siren!!!
CupcakeWarrior: it's food, and I like it everyonce and awhile.
Hai YouTube
Hi YOUTUBE
i do love me a good storm
google #mcdstories for lols
hiya YT, herostar why are we saying hello to Youtube?
Point A, where I live, point B, nearest McDonalds http://g.co/maps/fqrkz

WHAT'S UP YOUTUBE?!
jim, you're better off that way, mcdonalds is unholy

Hi there Bluestrom_S
GOD! I love their Chicken, Bacon and Swiss sandwiches so GOOD!

Chick-Fil-A supports anti-gay marriage so I can't eat their. *goes to McDonalds*
whats up everypony
*there*
hi Cypresswolf
Tovler: hmm, I did not know that. You mean they are against gay marriage, correct?
ohai Cypresswolf
hi Cypresswolf
You'd be surprised to hear this: Denny's has delicious food in Canada
But they have the BEST sweet tea <3
Denny's has good food ANYWHERE Polydunami
Damnit, now im hungry
Where'd you find this out Tovler?
me too
I shall return
Right
and those waffle fries ^_^
Tovler's right.
damn it all
:'( And those waffle fries
we only have sphaghetti
/me is getting hungry from all this food talk
It's owned by the Church of Latter Day Saints, to my understanding.
http://www.yogadork.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/themcrib-mcdonalds.png That is all.,
Ingwaz: so, they wouldn't hire homosexuals correct?
404
Randomnerd: i dont believe that is correct
that is fucked up
^
if true
i support gay marriage but i just don't want them doing their bussines in public
otakon: actually, i dont know, i dont think they wouldnt
Same goes for Papa Johns too, but Corporations tend to be right wing, so what would I expect?
Well I'm sure the option of listing sexuality on the application would be there otakon
yeah
wouldn't*
Sorry :P
I don't really care about gay marriage meself
it's discrimination against NOTHING that has anything to do with the job.
Ack, the Owner is SBC.
Eh, I don't care. They aren't hurting anyone, let them get hitched
Sorry 'bout that folks.
It'll illegal to discriminate over race, religion, etc as of now.
brb making hot dogs...
If they want to be as miserable as the rest of us, go right ahead
Mormons get enough flak, I don't wanna make it harder on 'em lol
Tovler: yh, but for how long?
Gay marriage just became legal where I live, I believe
IngloriousPony89: EXACTLY!
I dont go to resturaunt based on their beliefs, I go because I think they're food is good.
Indeed
I've said it once, I'll say it again. As long as you don't hurt other's or yourself, do what you like with your life.
That's my motto.
um....
nobody seen TOY_PON3?
nope
um, not recently no
nope
he was on yesterday, why?
Humans have an unfortunate tendency to hurt each other, though
he was here yesterday why?
I think he was on yesterday
Polydunami: yh
As long as hes not dead, its fine
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EY3SQfWhPs&t=1m45s
What does that mean?
yh?
anyone ever try those taco truck meals? :) Houston has a bunch of those driving around, get several on our job sites.
Never even heard of that Cypresswolf
Some of those, mainly the Woodlands area, has some great ones
What does yh mean, otakon?
yeah
Cypresswolf: The ones in my town are pretty good
Tovler: yh, but they are assholes. God forbid women have the option and choice to do what they want with their bodies....
Polydunami: yeah
Oh
it means yeah
I am Pro-Choice

otakon: its pretty unwise to bring up politically controversial arguments
ahh, thank you kirzstryfe
Polydunami: oooo
okay
Well, we're all in agreement so there's not really an argument per se.
Depending on the area, they're hit & miss. worst I had was a job site several years back, I got this burnt mush, took me off those trucks for 7-8 months
yuck
okay so i was playing god of war 3 and.....
Tovler: i do not agree, i am simply choosing to not voice my disagreement so there will not be an argument
kirzstryfe question ? can one talk about RF the song ?
...and mario_pony?
and i used the blades of athena to kill poseidon
then it was soo bloody and my mom was watching
and told me to turn of the system
mario_pony: You're mom had an :O face?
IngloriousPony89: wut?
Baytown had a good one, included beef liver as a meat choice, nice culinary experience. It was great, the texture I wasn't prepared for - gritty like sand, but the flavor was wonderful

mario_pony: Your mom watches you play video games?
I'm lucky that my mom is really lenient(probably spelt that wrong)with my interests. Games and ponies included :D
YES TOV! I love that vid
Man, can't spell. Good mornng everypony.
I havent gotten anything from a taco truck since I started doing deliveries, never on the job site when they pull up
you're = you are
I want a taco.
I used to play that during college
0,14yep, Nittany
And a good snuggle. >3<
Good morning for you BritishBrony. It's night for me :P
CupcakeWarrior: no she was just in the licing room talking on the phone while iwas playing
11,01Damn.
flutter_spin: you're welcome ^_^
0,14somebody wanted to know if the weather they were in was tornado weather
I still have it favorited somewhere :P
CupcakeWarrior: *living
Nittany_Discord: you'll be pleased to know that the storm sirens just sounded in my area and i hear thunder
i do so love a good storm
I thought it was Michael Jackson singing the chorus when I first heard this.
11,01Tornado sirens?
/me 11,01checks SPC.
If you happen to spot one driving around, theyre easy to spot, look like a box RV, with a menu usually on the right, has TACO in huge letters on the back
If it's tornado sirens you might want to consider taking cover somewhere. Just a suggestion
IngloriousPony89: appreciate the concern but i live in an area that is known for being hit by tornados every year, right now, this just looks and sounds like a thunder storm
11,01Why would you have a siren for regular thunderstorms?
Indeed
Quite odd
Go for a flour tortilla, chicken or beef - cant go wrong, cilantro, cheese, some green sauce - you have the perfect taco!
i have officially passed all of them except ghost of sparta and chains of olympus
you dont have a siren for when weather is getting severe?
Hurray for living in the NW so no tornadoes!
/me so the wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub can happen for all
11,01State College doesn't have sirens period.
11,01Even though we can get tornadoes. We're just not tornado-prone.
perhaps its just that i live in a smaller town area, we have a storm siren that sounds any time the weather gets severe
I've never even heard of sirens for severe weather Ingwaz. Only ones for tonadoes.
All we get in Vancouver is a storm warning on the Weather Network
tornados, or Canada.... hmmmm, I'll take tornados
Taco Bell? Pfft :| they wouldnt know genuine mexican cuisine if it bit them the *ahem*
I'd take Canada personally
:3
well i can assure you, i have heard this siren many many times, and many times it is just for a good thunder storm
/me THIS IS A TEST OF THE GIANT VOICE SYSTEM!!!
11,01Sirens in general are just to warn you that bad stuff is happening and to tune to weather stations and radio.
11,01Even then, you should keep one on.
Yep
nopony makes a taco like meicans and i should know
To be honest, Im freaking terrified of those things.
YES,
Nittany_Discord: then i fail to see why you're so surprised bythis siren
Just the sound of it just makes me nervous and I start to shake. I dont know why.
LadyCanary: Me too. Tornadoes scare the shit outta me
11,01Because warning sirens usually go off for tornado warnings.
0,14I'd like to be near a tornado
Not the tornados.
0,14like, see one in person
The sound of that emergency broadcast system.
SaxyPretender: is now SaxyTornado
perhaps your area is unique or mine is, because it regularly goes off
11,01I saw two tornadoes last year. One almost struck me and the people I was with.
Tornado Siren? That is when my mom gets the camera and goes outside
SaxyPretender, you and me both
11,01And that one I think was max-rated.
Oh God that's horrid LadyCanary. Hate that sound SOO much
/me the bees noooooo not the BEES!
and sax, tornados are exceptionally powerful, i enjoy the raw display of power, but theyre very dangerous
how do you spell read like after you read a book?
0,14ah
-.-
dat SaxyTornado
11,01They sure are dangerous, and fast.
mario_pony: read
mario_pony, it's read
the past tence of read?
reall wow
mario_pony: eeyup, it's read
11,01My first tornado came from a storm that developed a low-level rotation within 10 minutes.
indeed, ive had tornados go very near my house, even had one take our trash can and throw it across the street
It's always read, but past tense it's pronounced like red
past and present tense read is same, just pronounced differently
thanks guys!
mario_pony: english is weird like that...
it's all read. I read that book. He reads a book. They will read.
I've only experience being in range of a tornado once. While I was attending Brenham in 2009, we had the whole campus close, I didnt have class that day anyway so I didnt know what was going on. :P All I know was it was windy. Stayed in my apartment all day.
reed and red
I'm guessing you live in the tornado alley area Ingwaz and Nittany
indeed i do IngloriousPony89
Ingwaz: ikr
/me summons rainbow tornado to bronystate
Few days later, I go out for some fast food and then realized there was a tornado when I saw all the menus of the drive thrus were knocked over
I live right on the edge. Luckily far away enough so I get plenty of close calls but no actual tornados
/me begins vomitting rainbows
/me volcano and earthquake alley
ARGH
/me flies across the sky.
11,01I used to live in what's called Dixie Alley.
i think i live in one of the far edges of it, we regularly get hit by tornados, but usually theyre not extremely damaging, still pretty bad usually
I'm thankfully not in a climate or geograhy that supports them
11,01But I don't live in a tornado-prone area at the moment.
m0therp0wer
palm trees in the walmart parking lot were stripped
bolloks
11,01I want to live a lot closer to Tornado Alley.
Gaia is pissed off!
Happy 12th, 16th, 20th, 24th, 28th, and 32nd birthday to the bronies born today.

Im guessing Saxy is mad?

Punched clean through his computer screen
hello bronystate! :)

Hello there Hodiku ^__^
/me has returned
Welcome Hodiku!
Ingwaz: oh mah gawd
And welcome Phase4!
Bondage Twilight is hilarious
hey Hodiku!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R78hj0dcTNo&t=6m45s
...Uh oh.
But yes, the guy behind "Borat" and "Ali G" is going to play Freddie Mercury. Fuck all the things.
RAGINGPretender mad.
Ingwaz: i don't get the fluttershy part?
you forgot, its bondage twilight with socks, that makes it a whole new level of win
Anyone watch Hugo?
don't rage mah boi
:D that some rage. worst I ever did in rage was punch a hole in my door. I try to leave my electronics alone when I rage
RAGINGPretender: I can sympathize. I nearly threw a chair when I heard about it.
the average person has 1 fallopian tube
RAWRity: I dont even like Queen that much but that is HORRIFYING!
mario_pony: you know how when you're a teenager, youg et all rebellious and angry at everything and nobody understands you? thats basically teen angst
CupcakeWarrior: Inorite?
huh.
Ingwaz: ohh lol
My brother has the worst track record in rage
0,14man, I did not need to get angrier tofay
0,14*today
tofay lol
RAGINGPretender: USE THE ROYAL CANTERLOCK VOICE!
Cypresswolf: I punced a freezer door, with both hands nearly breaking them and putting to fairly big dents in the door.
0,14>be disappoint in Fighting Game Community
Though I did break my phone not long ago by throwing it across the room into the dresser...it died on impact
RAGINGPretender: why?
RAGINGTornado is a cool name
RAGINGPretender: what ahppened?
0,14>be enraged at some douchebag comment in my fighting game club
Also, thankfully it was discounted, but there were rumors that Taylor Swift was going to be in the new Les Miz movie next year.
0,14now this?
/me what now?
RAGINGPretender: you wouldn't happen to be a fan of Les Miserables, would you?
Say WHAT!?
I have fury!
0,14nope, RAWRity
I know a married couple that is SO into Les Miserables
MahBoi777: i see what you did there
What is Les Miserables?
RAGINGPretender: oh. Just wondering. Because apparenlty Hugh Jackman is going to play Valjean in the new movie.
my knuckles are still scabbed over from my bought with the door. I havent been that angry in a long time
They're newlywed geeks
quick! someone post something MLP that I have not favorited. Wait, is that possible?
ohai RAWRity
I knew u wud see mario_pony :D
lol
Go to Google
oooh was not aware there was a les miserables movie coming out, i'll have to go see it
what is the past tence of put?
No, it has to be "good"
flutter_spin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyYAhRr4tDk&list=LLMiKyfpd2YMs-0bb-hnzcFA&index=1&feature=plpp_video
0,14also, to those wondering WHY I'm mad the the FGC
I remember when Liam Neeson was Jean Valjean
0,14defending sexual harrasment is a fast way for me to be sad
...
oh my god I have never laughed so hard in my life..
IngloriousPony89: I believe it's out next week.
How the FUCK is that something to be defended.
how I miss 4chan..
LOL Fluttershy in that dress.
its a twisted world
0,14Because it's completely okay if that's "the way someone is"
RAGINGPretender: fgc?
mario_pony: put is a past tense
May I throw a shoe at this perfect and harass the person with a shoe?
LadyCanary: well you see, when you're a mysoginistic asshole, it's easy to justify being a cock rocket.
0,14fgc = fighting game community
so what is the present tence of put?
RAGINGPretender, I completely sympathize with you
/me ...
ahh i see, someone being a douche then?
And wholeheartedly
funny, yet ... kind of gross
mario_pony: I don think there is one
Well, the kids who shot up his high school in Ohio the other day was"just that way". Doesn't excuse the whole killing people thing.
afk
0,14there's a reality show/tournament going on to promote Street Fighter x Tekken (ugh)
/me the people who play most games in a competitive way are kind of dicks in general, FYI
....
DeadpoolDash: My exboyfriend.
0,14and there's two teams, one for SF and one for Tekken, each with a coach
RAWRity: it's in th news right now
LOL
He got pissed at me because I didnt get the controls right.
0,14and on each team, there's one female player
And I didnt know the movesets. WOW BIG DEAL.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/140407 not sure if this was posted here but its cool
1,3I mash da buttonz!
0,14now, the SF coach is Alex Valle, a true professional
that's stoopid. LOL
Wait a second. This is your playlist? *keeps watching*
/me mashing buttons is the best moveset
RAWRity: also this story of this girl who got in a fight ang got punched in the forehead then died the next day
LadyCanary: thats...wow. I've heard worse reasons to get mad at a significant other, but I can't seem to think of any atm.
kirz|art: did that work?
0,14the Tekken coach, Aris...is a complete creeper
He was an asshole.
Mashing buttons is the only way to win fighting games, imho
1,3so LadyCanary, did he know the moveset or did he just mash the button? :3
Oh no he "knew"
RAGINGPretender: sexual harassment panda
Or at least I think he knew so he could be cool.
RAGINGPretender: tekken i love that game!
you can't work the controls?? THAT'S IT we're through!
But still, Im no professional, I love playing for fun.
*jackie chan face*
Ingwaz: lol
0,14>use Team Tekken stream camera to film certain body parts of female player on his team
And I have a strong appreciation for character design and moveset.
TotalHalibut ^^
...
0,14>make various inappropiate comments
Oh...my
ahh...so he needs a good beating then RAGINGPretender
...
wait wut, lol
work or play video games?
i don't care as long as theres a good storyline
/me has a feeling he wasted an innuendo token
As a female, that kinda ticks me off.
/me most guys would just be happy their girlfriend even wants to play games
/me is wondering how long is takes for this conversation to drift to Fight is Magic territory
IngloriousPony89: already thought about that
0,14she took 5 days of that and quit yesterday
...Shit.
/me is entertained by this convo
ikr?
0,14and there are actually people defending Aria
0,14*Aris
I instantly thought of Mane6: Fighting is Magic
but I'm distracted by Ing playlist
as a human being, that REALLY ticks me off.
Seriously, oggling at a female characters breasts is one thing, but to actually make comments about it? On a LIVE show? Pathetic.
Same here
Seriously, you don't do that. You just fucking don't. To anybody.
it IS pathetic
RAGINGPretender: it would suck if he was found beaten up in a dark alley the next day
Woah what show was this??
/me wonders if TOY_PON3 will be back
/me I blame reality based entertainment. Completely ruined TV programming and is ruining interweb programming
I'll admit, I'll make jokes about the female character's boobs, but never on a LIVE show. It's only as a joke.
What was that really odd video I found about that very topic
ok everypony, imma fall asleep now. night.
Deadpooldash: Basically Jersey Shore?
Night Gunthler.
0,14and there were people putting her, THE VICTIM, on blast
Night Gunthler
....
Okay, that part ticks me off the most
=_=
/me even before Jersey Shore
Is LadyCanary gonna have to choke a son of a bitch?
Again, what show was this?
gnight Gunthler
Naw, I better not post it. Just add more fuel to the fire.
I absolutely despise the part where people blame the victim
^
LadyCanary: I will help you. With gusto.
LOL
The poor girl.
/me basically the second MTV stopped playing music videos was the beginning of the end
And this is why we can't have nice things.
Among other reasons
Reality killed the music video star.
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/418412 hehe, the video was saved in my Newgrounds Folder
well goodnight everypony it was fun chatting with you all.:)
0,14later mario_pony
One last time, and not to incur even more rage, what show was this that y'all are talking about??
Nice mario_pony!
Gnight mario_pony
nite, mario_pony
0,14IngloriousPony89, the show is called Cross Assault
Night mario-pony!
My brother works for Newgrounds, so he sometimes posts stuff to me
0,14it's a series of streams
no, the general acceptance of douchebaggery and immaturity amonst geek culture is pretty much the main reason we can't have ncie things. Like how we can't have a God of War game without Kratos fucking the Goddes of Love into unconciousness while 2 lesbians get off to it.
Buenas noches mario_pony ^__^
He's gone
0,14oh yeah, the worst part?
0,14this guy was like
...Theres MORE?!
/me hides
0,14"Oh, it's not the FGC [fighting game community] without sexual harrasment"

0,14ON STREAM
0,14fortunately, the guy that was interviewing him
/me bursts into flames
You know, its fun to watch Saxy raeg
>implying every Fighting game has to do with sexual harassment.
I call shenanigans on this fogy
And of course it's IGN too
*sigh* Why does this remind me of the brony who got a hug at bronycon?
0,14was like "Wait, I can't have Street Fighter without sexual harrasment?"
FUCK.
RAGINGPretender: as long as his ilk are allowed to get away with it, that's sadly true.
Pardon my language.
LadyCanary: there's not a fucking thing to pardon.
angry LC is angry
0,14I LOVE fighting games as you guys know
LadyCanary: what have we told you about speaking fancy?
pleaseeeeee use mlp swearing
0,14but, the community needs SERIOUS work
LadyCanary: keep doing it!
lies RAGINGPretender, you wouldnt play BB with me
BUCK?
Fuck that guy. In the ass. With a cactus. Until his farts ECHO.
^
lolz
0,14I'm sorry Ingwaz ;___;
OW DAYUM
uhhh RAWRity why would that cause his farts to echo?
Whoa RAWRity calm down!
Ingwaz: turn his sphicnter into a CAVE.
Even if it doesn't that means the torture wouldn't stop.
@_o
Make an example outta him
I have no idea why I instantly thought of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1JG4cycd4w
Derpy is against the spirit for friendship but twisting a bear's neck isn't?
0,14unfortunately, the fighting game community has a notion of being a "boy's club"
*smacks everypony on the forehead* You could have had a V8! :P Like Me :)
Ingwaz: let's just say I'm not allowed back in New York anymore, and leave it at that.
flutter_spin: Thank you so much:D
0,14so the few female players that do play get shit flung their way to no end
:/
How unfortunate...
0,14yep
flutter_spin, I'm sorry to do this, but I was just reminded of this clip
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0BUysglCZA
fat girls get it the worst.
Welcome to the weird part of Youtube
0,14also, RAWRity can't come see us NY people ;___;
dafuq Polydunami ?
o3o
Exactly
uggggh. That clip. Never did like it.
Polydunami: IF PAC-MAN WAS A HUMAN
Also Polydunami, dat music
Yeah
That's a lot of how it is amongst the FPS community. It's pretty much impossible for a female player to come into a game without getting hassled out the wazoo. Even if it's not anything derogatory, it's always "OMG, a girl! with like, lady parts!"
Those are actually bees
Reminds me of a Youtube video RAWRity. Ill try to find it
not the bees!
Wait, what's so special about a girl with lady parts?
0,14the president before me posted it in my school's fighiting game club FB page
RAWRity: what are these..."gurls" you speak of?
:3
*had to refresh
0,14and some...<insert choice words of expletives here> said some things that got me...
0,14whoo boy

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZfmPREbTd8&feature=youtu.be
whoa now. I know gawker sites have gone way downhill, but its my source of gaming news
What pisses ME off mostly, is that some girls feed into the whole sexism, as in how they just take sexy pics of themselves with a controller and say OMG YEAAHHH I PLAY WOW LOLOL. Want a freaking medal? UGH. You dont have to be an attention whore...girls get enough shit in places of the gaming community.
hey RAGINGPretender, http://i41.tinypic.com/21niq8z.jpg
/me cheers LadyCanary
WOO
I think most of those girls aren't really gamers themselves LadyCanary.
I play on the trying to be sexy = not sexy
do none of the mods want to stream right now?
1,3owait, girls can't play games and aren't on the internet, forgot that for a second :3 >.>
CupcakeWarrior, that is awesome
They play a few rounds of MW3 and think there gamers
I love freaky stuff myself
As I recall it, a few months ago, a reporter for one of Gawker's sites posted a long ass speal about how this guy she went on a date with was a total loser because he as a former M:TG player. The site got a record number of hits for the month.
No. They arent. I dont make a big deal that I play vidya games, I just have a normal conversation with guys OR girls about said game.
0,14oh yeah, THAT debacle, RAWRity =_=
/me 13smacks kirz|art from orbit
:D Shizuka!!!!
/me glomps Shizuka <3
hiya Shizuka
lol. I probably only pay attention to 10% of what goes up on gawker sites.
Ohai Shizuka
13we are too on the internet
Shizuka: give him a rich slap for that one!
11,01I only want to play online games with friends now.
That's whot those sites do. They post shit to piss people off and gain more views, and thus more ad revenue.
Trolling is entertaining I guess
>.>
RAGINGPretender: dont forget to put on your serious face http://i40.tinypic.com/2ia7ats.jpg
1,3sorry, had to play that card for the fun of it <3
Trolling is kind of fun, tbh
Gamer Girls may have been pretty uncommon 20 years ago, but nowadays, there's TONS of femals gamers. And people need to stop acting like they aren't there, or that they should be objectified.
/me puts in his Groucho Marx glasses and his Gummi hat

I concur
i'm aware, trying to get you to calm down a little bro
0,14I know XD

RAWRity: The female gaming community has increased.
flutter_spin: don't post links to those sites. They don't deserce the traffic.
All in that same second :D
I know female geeks irl
0,14I don't usually get too bent out of shape, but when I feel really passionate about certain things
wow, you really mean it? Alright. I won't post them...
1,3one of my best friends from my WoW days was the best Hunter in the battlegroup, and she kicked everyone's ass in raid by ~7k dps on average
That deserves a top story?
0,14I can get carried away
It's no trouble at ALL RAGINGPretender. Just say how you feel <3 its all good.
13uh huh uh huh you're just trying to dig out now
It happens to all of us.

pickle barrel kumquat pickle barrel kumquat pickle barrel kumquat
LadyCanary: I know. and yet game makers are still under the impression that all gamers are teenage boys who want every female character to have boobs the size of VW Bugs.
No shame in feeling passionate about something RAGINGPretender

RAWRity: That reminds me of something I heard. I dont remember when, but the head of advertising for a game OK'd to have a female character be on the ads wearing not so appropriate armor because it was the only real thing they could advertist due to the game being to lackluster.
NIGJT

Goodnight Derpy and kkirz ^__^
night Derpy_Hooves sleep well
Night Derpy!
1,3I'm not leaving, other ponies are :p
By any chance RAGINGPretender, do you play Blazblue?
0,14yep
It's the same thing with Comic companies. They keep targeting 15-year-old boys, yet fail to realize that THAT EXACT DEMOGRAPHIC IS THE MOST HATED AMONGST EVERYONE ELSE. And when you try to play a game or read a comic book, and have so many cheesecake and ass shots thrown in your face, it gets to the point where you feel insulted.
0,14^
/me hugs RAWRity. All the yes.
IngloriousPony89: probably something like Evil Zone from the PS1 days. I actually like that one.

And I think Bayonetta actually handled making a sexy character not be sexist pretty well. Not perfect, but the developers did a pretty good job

IngloriousPony89: they opennly admitted it was to make it sexy
fillyfillyy: that's exactly what I'm saying. The average 15 yo boy is imature, and just interested in explosions and tits. This doesn't make for an enjoyable game or story for anybody else.
they just gave it good gameplay as well

IngloriousPony89: agreed, if only for all that damn hair though.
/me 13doesn't look at explosions
:P
13like a cool pony
If video games and comic books want to stay relevant, they have to realise that they aren't going to be able to profit soully off of teenage boys. They have to GROW UP.
0,14I'm the Bang player XD
1,3that's because Shizuka is a badass pony
RAWRity: are you saying i only like explosions and tits? cause i dont im not really the average 15 year old boy
And now I'm off to bed. Ciao!

*thinks about joining in conversation...* nope. I come here to escape all that stuff.

RAWRity: im not immature bro

It's fun to apart of a demographic that is never marketed towards.
CupcakeWarrior: yeah
Shizu is getting hugs, what awesome thing did she say?
Because seriously, it gets downright embarassing when you're reading a comic, and suddenly get a fullpage spread of Wonder Woman's ASS, in lovingly detailed lingerie.

Power Girl can actually be interesting when she's got a decen writer behind her, but yeah, her costume is completely shameless fanservice. WHY DOES SHE NEED A CLEAVAGE WINDOW?

This chat needs more ponies
RAWRity: she doesn't. i'm not saying it's not nice to look at but even to me it seems a bit shameless. First time I saw the character design I thought "Must be fanwork..must be..."
1,3that reminds me, I need to stop by the comic store tomorrow :)
I'm usually skeptical about fanservice in my entertainment
0,14I haven't read comics in aaaages
I don't mind fanservice
0,14too broke to buy ;___;
I don't know. I've only heard that cleavege gets sweaty and it's nice to have some air [/talking_out_of_ass]
But too much breaks it
Indeed
otakon: apparently she's getting a new costume. I believe with less blatant fanservice.
fanservice is best service
I could lend you one of mine, Saxy.
i demand more derpy ducreux pics about pony songs ~
Animal Man New52.
RAWRity: inb4 lots of inbetween the legs shots
Indeed
^
Fanservice CAN be done well. I think that One Piece generally pulls it off well, though it can be distracting. And GTO did a fantastic job of making the fanservice comical and part of the plot.
Same here, kirz
Fanservice reminds me that I'm an animal with basic instincts.
RAWRity: agreed, but damn it all if Edo doesn't like his Big Girls it seems....
RAWRity: I LOVE GTO.
One Piece is so wacky
But generally in comic books, you get tons of upskirt and bondage shots for females.
I love it
I love One Piece
Indeed he is a Great Teacher <3
1,3glitter's nice to look at, but doesn't do much for you at the end of the day
This is why the anime club at my high school was crap.

Onizuka is Best Teacher
For me, One Piece wins over Bleach and Naruto
FRANKY!
Ladycanary : great Teahcer Onizuka

Oh, And GTO
Yes <3
I really need to watch more anime
LOL
I don't know. I never really bothered with any of those anime series
Polydunami: you know why? NO FRIGGIN FILLER! EVERYTHING IS IMPORTANT!
yay. new chapter of Bleach tomorrow
0,14oh right
And how many episodes of Bleach are there /sigh
flutter_spin: the manga, go for the manga!

Who played GTO in the english version?
I cant remember...
Soul Eater? Oh dammit. Its a new chapter of Soul Eater Not.
Is it wierd that I only watch english dubs?
Polydunami: not really, everything has importance. Every character introduced has development. I mean hell, look at Colby(spelling) from Ep.1 showing up just before the great war and all
I mean the anime
CupcakeWarrior: no, there's plenty of peopl who just prefer dubs.
Polydunami: yh, maybe a little
The One Piece anime had filler, but it was entertaining
G8, for one
G8?
It's after Skypiea
ah
I never watched much of the One piece anime, because I was introduced via the 4Kids dub. Oh lord.
RAWRity: Ah yes!
Hi guys! 4th day on bronystate today! Im in England and its 5 in the morn i cant get to sleep cause im ill so i went on brony state im missing skool YAAY!:D
that fucking 4Kids dub.
You're right
RAWRity: DO NOT MENTION THAT BLASPHEMY!
My mom used to buy me Sonic comic books. I still have like 30 of them in the garage. I just never really liked reading in general.
lol
One Piece was so awesome that the 4kids dub made me want to see more.
Hey applejack, which year?
applejack096: well welcome! you walked into animation discussion!
lol
For some reason, I used to love the dub of Sonic X
Oh yeah, it's applejack096!
RAWRity: the intro alone is shameful enough.
Hello, applejack096
Those super-old sonic comics might be worth something
indeed
I think so RAWRity: I must watch it agaaaaain. Because HE BREAKS DOWN THE FUCKING WALLS

Dum dum has gum gum?
Photon-Phoenix: he means Chopper.
Chopper is a deer
NOT a bear
thiws hurts me, and i don't even care about one piece
I thought he was a Tanuki
he turns into something that resembles a bear
when mad
Actually, we haven't even SEEN a Bear Zoan type
Or a manbearpig.
naw, that's a deer
I especially love how they couldn't figure out anything for Nami's part. "An L-A-D-Y Nami's not shy"
Photon-Phoenix: it's an empowered human form.
otakon: Oda's obviously saving it.
If Oda can come up with a candlewax power...
RAWRity: yeah, likely. There is that one bear martial artist but he's not a Zoan.
otakon: there's also Kuma

Photon-Phoenix: neither
RAWRity: eh, he's a cyborg.
Photon-Phoenix: I'll take "Rock The Dragon" any day.
How can a paw print power be any threat?

Dragon ball GT's opening made my brain shut off
Oh rock.
Shouldn't paw pads just absorb stuff?
My bad~
Especially the stock screams in their. And that guitar riff!
so all I remember is the parapara brothers and that retarded robot
Photon-Phoenix: People actualy watched GT?
See, we Canadians got a different opening song
noe
nope
I watched GT and I hated it
I saw 5 eps max
Tovler|Sleep: enope, not in this case. It reflects anything with the same amount of force that is applied. You want a clip?
Nope, still no new Bleach chapter
Bleach might be ending

then just type out youtu.be and copy the V= tag
Hey RAWRity, that manga won't sit well with some ponies
I only WATCH the anime not read them
i read and watch
Berserk has, hands down, the best art I've ever seen in a manga.

The only reason I'm in to Bleach is because the manga chapters take 2 minutes out of my life a week.
And yeah, we still have Vampire Knight
I've heard good things about Skip Beat
Me too
Bleach is waaaay too long
Bleach is the new DBZ
does anyone know how long it takes that confirm thing to come through from paypal?
CupcakeWarrior: and yet it doesn't take long to archive binge at all.
Bleach is actually longer than dbz i believe
Midnight_Tempest: no, you see DBZ at least had decent fights. Bleach doesn't even have that anymore.
its gotta be double the episodes at least
The way Bleach is drawn, I'm able to tear through each chapter like a flipbook
One Piece is probably going to be twice as long as Dragonball
Probably being the keyword here
CupcakeWarrior: not quite. Dragonball's manga ended at 520 chapters. Bleach is at about 480 atm.
One Piece take like 10 minutes to read each chapter.

DBZ was maybe around 300 eps... Bleach has gotta be almost 400 maybe 500... havent watched in over a year, maybe 2
One Piece will go as long as it needs to because One Piece ends when he gets to the grand line

God I hope a remake

GODDAMNITDARIBOT!!!!
What's a Bolder Gate. I can't participate!
can i hope for remake and new game ?
i couldnt get into that game... too slow and i hated the THACO armor system
13AD&D rules were pretty dumb
Tovler|Sleep: old school D and D rpg from when Black Isle was GREAT
13getting a 3.5e baldurs gate would be great
Shizuka: negative AC is good, makes 0 sense
D&D 3.5 is apparently best, but i never played that version
134e... i guess that would be okay if they got all the team together
Midnight_Tempest: basic d20 ruleset, very uniform
IIRC, first level magic users in AD&D had a total of 1 spell.
i dont mind 4th, cause im a noob to D&D... but i enjoy it so much
13yeah... to hit armor class 0... WAT
RAWRity: eeyup, and a CAT could kill them
Okay, there are lots of manga without gratuitous fanservice so let's shift the conversation that way
Ad&D armor and THAC0 vs the d20 system are really very similar
well...that was fairly pointless
Or other ways too
bronysate need an oficial team for tf2, left 4 dead and some other games ~ so everyone can go mod vs viewers or something like it ~
/me GANTZ was different
So if you wanted to be a high level magic user, you had a learning curb as steep as the fucking grand canyon.
just trekked in a slight drizzle for about 20 minutes to find the source of a noise that sounded like a car horn, thought maybe somebody wrecked. Get to the area where the noise is coming from...and it stops

I will thanks for warming me
err warning*
well... F:NV just creeped me out again... they just pulled a Doctor Who on me and i almost pooped myself
wow that just came out bad
Midnight_Tempest go look for the legendary cazadore ~
o.o god no
Bluestrom_S: did your antivirus not detect that site was dangerous?
what site?
/me heh heh heh http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTQSBm5A_FI
Midnight_Tempest legendary deathclaw then ?
i was playing Old World Blues and fighting those trauma harnesses and one of them said 'Hey! Who turned out the lights?'
Midnight_Tempest: lol

Silver_Streak: dont worry about it
I didn't hit a link or anything I just typed the name worng and got that
no my computer didn't say anything
I'm using chrome
Bluestrom_S: run a scan
legendary... deathclaw... DO NOT WANT!!

Midnight_Tempest: Legendary Cazador is WORSE!!!!
T_T
i know
Anybody knows where I can find MLP stickers without having to buy a coloring/activity book?
Midnight_Tempest ohh come one killing those is part of the fun ~
I don't have one :(
Midnight_Tempest: also, Legenday Bloatfly can kill in 2 hits...
on*
jajajja
http://i13.mangareader.net/berserk/307/berserk-823725.jpg
wait hahaha
i just killed the legendary bloatfly without getting hit
Okay, that German guy was incredibly idiotic
lol good advice
stfu
love that vid
Let your hands do the talking
Midnight_Tempest: I had a level 35 guy with max endurance, armor, and relevant health perks and he died bc the damn thing exploded on him.
is zone alarm still good? I used to use that to warn me
..... no you let your tongue do the talking Polydunami :P
:3
ehehehe
/me licks Silver_Streak
otakon: i killed it from a distance with an anti-material rifle at level 29
OMG MELA WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY EW EW EW EW EW EW
Midnight_Tempest: yeah, me too but the explosion is Mini Nuke big
/me licks Silver_Streak again
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH MAKE IT STOP EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW EW
because something tastes good...
legendary cazadore was annoying because i was going melee
I DON'T TASTE LIKE CUPCAKES
Silver_Streak: get used to it, also beware of nommers like kirzstryfe
/me nibbles on Silver_Streak
05lessen the allcaps.
Bluestrom_S: i suggest you download the following programs, all of them are free, avast antivirus, malwarebytes anti malware, super antispyware and spyware blaster
otakon: really? cause i was never touch by the explosion... i was also above it and in a tunnel
/me nibbles on Silver_Streak's paw
:( it's the royal canterlock voice... i'm having fun.
Midnight_Tempest: that's why, I had to get into the room with it
Mel stop wrek ruined the fun...
oh, lol
Silver_Streak: Wrek|Observing doesn't like allcaps, best listen to him
avast is a fairly good free antivirus, malwarebytes is made to get rid of the particularly nasty viruses, and the other two programs get rid of spyware which tracks what you do on your computer
It doesn't translate well in the chat room
who did what?
/me http://youtu.be/L-Ui5Suk7q0 ...click if you dare
05that excuse never works, feel free to continue, but dont effign allcaps 4 sentences in a row
DeadpoolDash: so help me.

back to the awesome lol
why do they all ask you to 720p? do they get money for it or something?
Do they have any pony vids for Spyro music?
Rain: 720p is hi-def
still... New Vegas wins the creepy fight with the Vashta Narada ref...
Rain: 720p is HD
I know that
but why do they care so much that you watch it in that?
HD looks good thats why
Mainly because it looks better. But sometimes it takes a while to buffer on that setting
Rain: because it actually has higher sound quality in HD
lol dat pinkie
not in my experiences but w/e
if I cud make just one suggestion about lag lol http://youtu.be/ZcP9jiCbakw
Same applies to 1080p but it makes my videos lag by a second
This is so peaceful 0.0
the quality in sound between 480 and 720 is hard to tell sometimes
These kinds of video must take a while to make
Rain: very few songs do, but I've seen a few where it REALLY does make a dif

GUSTY GARDEN!!!!!!!!!
Gusty Garden was an epic theme
Midnight_Tempest, where are you sticking knices again?

Midnight_Tempest: Ooohh...i hope you didn't hurt yourself too bad

WHOA
/me brings Midnight_Tempest a first aid kit
it's beautiful
Bill, heal him!
im fine AttackWithHugs... im at the point that if i dont bleed a bit a day, i think something is wrong... well... typing that out made it sound even worse than i thought...
This song is amazing. <3
10,02This one is epic :3
I haven't played a mario game in years
Every song from the galaxy games are awesome.
10,02IKR
Midnight_Tempest. Don't overdo yourself until you get better.
Midnight_Tempest, the closest thnig you can do to dividing yourself by 0 is using a hula hoop
Haha, omg, flashbacks to SNES. :D
awesome, the ol ghost house theme, but they redid it, lol
I kinda miss SMW
Mutterguy: are you sure? cause i got about... *counts* 11 knives in my room right now... and a hatchet...
I swear I've heard this ino ne of the rpgs

HatchetRyda: im guessing your worried? dont be... ive been collecting knives for years, though i do tend to cut myself more often than i should
I'll always be a fan of mario
no Midnight_Tempest.. if you use all those you'd be dividing by 12... which a bit further from your target than you'd want. no playing with knives
Mutterguy: your no fun >_<
Hey everypony! Bye everypony!

10,02Rainbow Road on the 3DS is just one long course instead of having multiple laps.
HatcheyRyda: cause i honestly have a hatchet next to me right now... choppy choppy
Maria was the protagonist in the opera scene for FF6

reminds me of when I played Mario Kart on the N64 with my cousin TT_TT
Mischief makers!! :D
Midnight_Tempest: ok...just be careful with that thing

/me I have achievements, digital trophies make no sense since a trophy is a physical item
Anyone who respects gaming doesn't get a job at gamestop. :hmph:
Egoraptor is a bit of a nutcase :3
xD
lol
awesome series nuff said
yay, stream
normal people are fucking boring, everyone should have some nut in his head
I agree
It's like watching a extremely trivial version os "The Next Iron Chef".
What is this even called?
so whats this?
the testers?
that was on the wall
playstation, playstation playstation?
idol'
same difference
Based on the dislikes I saw on the video, egoraptor went home.
Lolstation.
egoraptor. i know that name from somewhere
they just tested who would be a good game tester by asking them question while bathing their heads in cokroaches. there's only one thing thing this is. FLYING BULLCRAP
Phase4: You're kidding. you're kidding, right?

:O
that seems fair
they're kicking him out becasue he's good for marketing?
WHAT?
Oh come on, Egoraptor is the only valid gamer there. :P
they are offering a job after all
Dashie_Dashie: I agree
Dark__Horst: i think the position is for something else
dat sackboy
Sony: U MUST BE L337 TO JOIN U$ L0LZ.
...it's game testing
think its sackboyh
:(
Is there a reason they can't use their real damn name?
there'ds always publicity involved in testing
Placebo: It's not cool and "Gamer" to do so.
Horseapples. They're offering them a job, and a 100k.
Placebo: it would reveal their secret identity
Placebo: internet cred
hey jackasses, put your heads in the cockroaches and have an interview
There IS the small matter of professionalism?
egorapter is known by his account egoraptor
this panel is dumb
nobody knows his real name, why should he use iot?
that's how internet names work
Lol
there IS a reason behind that
That backhanded comment.
and so she got a job at Microsoft and made hundreds of dollars, lol
simpsons just started here
fuck you bitch, one does not simply kick out egoraptor
aparently couches can survive re-entry
teh prize was suprising
kaay
stop looking at me!
woohoo he gets to stay
egoraptor seems like a smart guy
yeah but they'll take your videos down.
And now the hater on him "waaah, because of his fans"
loldislikebots
Turning the gaming community into Big Brother.

egoraptor is the only one that doesn't emit an aura of jersey shore
>back to fanfics
Yes please.
game testing is not about being very good at them
Lets vote in DAshi_Dashie for the next season?
SuperBrony64: this seems ok
that's probably why they want him out

00,10Bull shit.

10It's like this, but with progamers
/me now has money to buy games :)
I like how they rub in your face how your going to lose the dream of becoming ((etc etc etc))
10progamers and noobs, together in one competition
not much but its more than nothign
so...game tester is now called production associate?
so mean
10the progamers have to do physical challengers, the noobs have to play BF3
Like EA!!!
It was pretty obvious we're trashing you.
05fuck EA
10challenges*
05hard and wihtout mercy!
lol
00,10wait give them the job, sony does exactly that all the time.
This is like making a proper game, don't rush it, do it slowly, or you have to go back and redo it
Wrek, the only EA game I have respect for is SSX
>_<
oh god, BF, the embodiement of teamplay... with THESE guys?

05but its nothing liek the 3rd
you should play some old ones Wrek, during your streams.. if you can find torrents for them.
10Starflash it's like an.. action RPG? It wasn't well-advertised, but I caught wind of a release-day livestream
05i have bee nstreaming syndicate DOS, ABUSE, some starcraft, some other stuff too
10and I really liked it so I bought it
:O

10it's a lot like Fable, if you want a rough idea
We need an Ages of Empires stream .__.

So, it's late at night here, aye? I like to consider myself an intelligent individual.
Mutterguy: It's early. But still bored. :/
it's late for me
And being intelligent means being aware of ones surroundings, correct?
We wait for the next pony. And, well...
Well, I come from a place where people are incredibly...
bad.
-_-
I have the weirdest stick boner right now.
No. Being inteligent does NOT mean being aware all the time.
so much wut
wtf just happened
So over the years, I've come to the conclusion that "good" people are hard to come by.

In other words, the one who isn't you. There's really only one way to deal with that... and simply, deal with that.
I get that.
I love blue.
Maaaaaaam

And honestly, that's better than "Oh she's out there, man. There's that girl just waiting for you to come along, sweep her up, and shtuff."
It's entirely possible you may be making the same mistakes you consider them to be doing. There's no such thing as a perfect ANYTHING.

Fffuuuuuu
And I am utterly close to giving in to..
I'm 54, have bad teeth, a damaged nervous system and an artificial hip. And I'm okay with that.

05i dunno the name of it
Mmm, slurpies.
10WTFBerserk honestly all I did was just turn around and say 'fuck the world' because I realised I was so much better than 98% of the people :D. I mean I have no advice aside from that I personally learned that people fucking suck, and you've gotta remember you're the best guy evar and shit
RainBroDash: Dat ego :o
10,02I thought I was your favorite ;____;

In terms of fucking the world.

Well, my question is, is it really true that... women, once they've matured and such, once they've "had their fun", it may or may not b a little more difficult to procure a morally decent person of a wife?
-_-
brbrbrbrbrbrbbrbrbrbrbr
Basically, this:
Does "being good" really pay off in the end? From all I've seen, all being good gets is a fucked up vagina and an unfaithful wife. Good guys finish last, eh?
Derpy :)
Lalalalala
WTFBerserk: It's been proven that being a douchebag makes you more succesful in life, so take what you will from that fact.

I got my right hand

That's how i 've coped
Snuffsis: TMI, man.
No girlfriend, No drama, No problem.. well that's how I see it seeing as every chica where I live causes Drama.
my last ex-girlfriends BFF almost stabbed me
I don't really need a girlfriend to be happy.
DAWWWW!!!!

One. Love and Tolerate. Friendship-- in life can be magic. and it's not a BAD idea to be a decent person. And two- Hell YAEH, ponies can be awesome. Take from that what you will.

RE...MIX!!!
Would the other bronies here agree I summed up the Brony Philosphy in a short form?
4 for me
T-T
Isn't this a swedish artist, if i recall correctly? :O
Take pride in the fact that you're being the "nice guy" and be happy about it. Love the fact that you know better and be happy with your life :p
Kencolt, what did you sum it up as?
...
If a tree falls in the forest and nopony is there to hear it.....WHAT IF ITS FLUTTERSHY ?
NO SB
One. Love and Tolerate. Friendship-- in life can be magic. and it's not a BAD idea to be a decent person. And two- Hell YAEH, ponies can be awesome. Take from that what you will.
10,021 / 29

Kencolt: hmm.... Well, it's all true, but what good does it do to state the obvious? xd

Admittedly, Love and Toleration does have certain limits.

10,02I play it again after the 29th time, to dedicate it to you
So...um Hasbro hate bronies now?

WTFBerserk: you can always count on the internet to help you in times of need, except 4chan
/me gives a massive hug and a peck on the cheek lol
I figured if no one was here, I'd probably end up going there.
4chan made me into the bitter dick I am towards relationships today.
10I met some great people on that website
can't say I reget it honestly.
I don't even know what you were wondering from the start though, mind if i ask?

WTFBerserk: Exactly, ponies, especially pinkie pie, makes you HAPPY

After the whole Derpy incident?

/me is ramble
SB64, can you plya Smile song, to cheer us up a bit? :)
/me is go back to playing zelda on guitar

WTF... Kind of. We see that even if we don't get that in return, there's no reason we should NOT follow thoe virtues... and watching the show-- call out others when they fail to.
hmm this is when i say that they missed the moon

RanDT1: 10 minutes longer than your sanity will hold out

10oh god
An episode?
bye fo r now
10cya kwak ^^
later KwakLad2
Oh, THAT-- No, Hasbro does not, but even they have to-- at times-- give a bit under certain pressure. Because some people do NOT get the point and make LOUD noises.
Cya Kwaklad :)
Goodbye KwakLad
if you wanted a pony e[isode why don't you just go on youtube?
BLAZBLUE

Kencolt, that was some crazy spamming the bronies did
WTF-- this kind of sums up all here! That and our anthem.
This song is exactly what I need to lift my mood.
WTFBerserk: This song is best for cheering people up, you should download it. :D
00,10gonna have to do better then that sb =p
SuperBrony64: do you have to be a mod for restream?
Err...this, otherwise this stream would get a little out of hand. With little being a huge understatement.
10*cough* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOT3pmynZlY *COUGH*
Yeah, @SuperBrony64
10,02Not previously though, Sumica used to be a streamer before becoming a Mod...but as of now we don't have any non-mods streaming.

I love the animation of her walking in this song!
Why does this song make me want to tear up? I dont get it >.<
Would the host mind playing the song one more time?
It's so jumpy and on beat :D
RaveBrony: tears of joy or sadness? :D
