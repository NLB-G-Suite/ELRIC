O_o
09,01not really
WHEATLEY'S BROTHER!
09,01this is just the basic tutorial
09,01it gets REALLY intense
Dashie_Dashie: I want moar jelly
06wubwub
boring
0,14I like the visual style
13wubwubwub
13wub wub, wub dollars
Rock paper scissors SHOOT
The battle system is shit
.-.
NewDCD: it's a guessing game at heart later on I'm sure, I HATE rock paper scissor battle systems. Endless Space or what not had it too, and it sucked there too
13wubwub wub, wub dollars
13wubwub wub wub wubwubwub, priceless
0,14XD
/me wonders what Shiz is talking abou
I played a PS game a long time ago that used a paper-rock-scissors system or combat. It was called "Dragonseeds" I think. I remember being continually frustrated at how
09,01oh man Dragonseeds
"Coincidentally" good the computer was at guessing.
09,01dat game
13so it's six round rock paper scissors
you have to guess ahead of time what your opponent will doahead of time and if you don't do the correct sequence you will not win ever
eveeer
ever
ever ever ever ever
:|
otakon: shittiest battle system ever
never ever ever ever ever ever?!?!
F this (rolls dice) YES 16!
09,01kinda, without counting Skills and Codecasts
CupcakeWarrior: agreed, no strategy at all
09,01hey you guys
09,01cut it out : I
get inside your opponent's computerized head!
.-.
NEVER
I hate this game with a passion now
.-.
ATTACK
13.-.
09,01that said I have a friend who's studying game design and he's liking the game from an objective perspective
09,01so yeah
NewDCD: well I'm not bashing on you for liking it
turn around
i dont wanna be mean .-.
dat dragon
every now and then
Attack Attack Guard, Guard Attack Attack
"pylon Soul"... do Pylons actually HAVE souls?
lucky
i get a little bit worried
ded
09,01okay this is where it gets real
Baptist Pylons do, but not catholic ones
Dem Metal Gear Acid
K
I hope so
two of him?
AaaA
... and... if pylons have souls... then does that mean they have relions and afterlives too?
my brain hurts!
09,01ohai Prologue player character
Getting real
three of him
hmm.. DAT KINGDOM HEARTS BEGINNING
0,14dun dun dun
DCD: Appreciate your friend's input, but I'd note that I've done some game development and I can't say I care for it myself. To each their own though
wait
MY BRAIN HURTS
somethin seems fishy
um
09,01have you played the game though CK?
YOUR OWN DOLL TURNS ON YOU AND KILLS YOU!?
09,01it's a different thing to play it
This level design = Kingdom hearts beginning level.
Howso? Does it institute time limits?
yeah we just saw that
otakon: makes sense, dolls are evil
apparently
LOSE LOSE LOSE
dat chain
Last player character I had that lasted only through the prologue and croaked after was the guy at the start of "Calling".
and here come the crap shoot
ded
and we see NewDCD getting his ass kicked again
CHEAP AS SHIT
scary game .-.
If it starts forcing you to pick your options quickly, then sure, it could be ugly. But I'm not too fond of a system whose combat basics grant you a 33% chance of picking the correct option
aw man
ded
ehmm someone have a google docs or pdf of "Eternal" please ?
GAME OVER! for real
D:
09,01CK, it's not like that
Ouch
09,01and now it's time for you to see how awesome shit gets
This game legitimately pisses me off!
NewDCD: you died, it's gameover time to start over again
NEXT character
13you guys obviously haven't seen sequelitis
FROM THE BEGINNING.
Shizuka: i have
wow, great game kills you over and OVER AND OVER AND OVER
O___O
in a galaxy far far away
:O
:|
Dem students
it's like Demon's Souls WITHOUT the progression
Errybody be dead.
0,14dat BURNING SPIRIT
he ded
13STAND STRONG
It's not? But that's what the tutorial just presented. You select from three options, of which only one yields an ideal result of damage. One yields a tie, and one is bad.
Never give up, never give in.
Yours it the Drill that will pierce the Heavens!
Stand FOR EQUESTRIA!!!
you're the best AROUND
09,01and here's the moment I fell in love with the game
/me agrees with CriticKitten SO HARD
0,14Stand up and FIIIIIIIIIIGHT
Thus, 33% success rate if picking based purely from luck, without any other tweaks.
nothin's eva gonna keep u down!
holy grail
CriticKitten: eeyup
GET UP ;_;
I admit it's only the "basics" but that's not a core system I would personally start with.
and then suddenly catchy music
0,14oh shi-
Ohey....Archer?
09,01DAT BOSSNESS
...
Well HELLOOOOOO
0,14DAT ARCHER SWAG
hmmmm
Saxy music
Haaaaandsooooooooome.
Wait, Archer's in here?
it?
so THAT'S Archer
./////.
And it's Fate/Stay's Archer, too
Whos Archer?
Total Badass
I think LadyCanary likes
A super secret spy for ISIS
09,01SPOILERS: It's not Shirou
0,14Archer = badass
what
Good, like him better than Fate/Zero's Archer
1___1
20% cooler:D
09,01none of the servants on this game are the same Legendary Souls as the main game
0,14I may not know much about the Nasu-verse
This game still sucks
Fante watch you doing in another game ?
I HAVE NO CLUE WHATS GOING ON HERE
dante*
yes agree
ofna01: me neither
0,14but Archer's badass is spoken about far and wide
then how did he become a Hero
no idea
Well, off to bed! See ya all later, and enjoy the stream! Thank you for streaming NewDCD! <3

Now that I am back I am all WTF
Sword it to death!
Archer has swag with every strike!

0,14man, Archer's so snarky
ATTACKK!!
LUCKY
This whole Holy Grail thing sounds pretty violent. Can't the masters just take turns playing slap-hands instead?
are those cubes?
or a ravishing game of say uncle perhaps?
uncle
oh look more cubes to fight
More luck based bullshit!
09,01it's not luck-based
0,14>implying there's not apattern
09,01the enemies actually have patterns
09,01you gotta decypher it by using your brain
is it more training?
09,01you know, something most people seem to hate doing
Powerpoint is now a currency?
VR Mission
09,01it's more of a puzzle based system than a luck based one
Krakass: lol
gotta get inside the enemies head
waiting
yh, but not all of them follow a pattern 100% of the time, and considering a wrong choice can result in no damage or taking critical damage it really is seemingly luck based
09,01that's what techniques and code casts are for
09,01if you can't plan accordingly and take precautions for taking damage
you just took friggin 25% damage from TWO HITS
09,01you're just not very much of a clever pony : I
no, I prefer some actual TACTICS
ohai guise :)
09,01if we go by that logic
09,01all RPGs are luck-based
hi Tarku!
09,01what with they just being a collection of RNGs
um but you have more options than just 3 actions
Eh... Like I said, I played Dragonseeds back in the day, and this system looks much much better than what that game had.
that's the difference
I just thought there wasnt any patterns
13dice are so not RNGs, they KNOW man... they KNOW when you need a certain roll...
0,14XD
Shizuka: eeyup, and they LOVE screwin you over at tiems
it's magical
Besides, Fire Emblem also had kinda a P-R-S type system kind of too, and I loved that game.
0,14heck, even Soul Calibur
09,01an attack pattern I kind of love
0,14at its core is a R/P/S
Pale_Horse: yh, but a good Axe user COULD beat a Sword user
0,14which they build upon
09,01is the Bull-type enemies
Pale_Horse: it wasn't end all be all
that's true.
Uh oh. Archer is about to reveal that Santa doesn't exist.
the bad news is no new pony this week
09,01they use the command they were weak to in their last attack, creating a cyclical pattern
in this, without knowing the enemies pattern ahead of time you have a satistical chance of doing the correct action of 33%
/me secretly wishes Archer was a brony
09,01that's where levels and Information Matrixes come into play : I
I like those odds!
09,01there are mechanics for that : I
maybe he is... >.>
09,01plus you can just...use skills as well
13otakon: you have a 33% chance of getting them all right yes, but there's a better chance of getting any of them right
hmmm still NewDCD the battle system could be improved,
its a cellphone
Shizuka: but that's where over options come up that don't OUTRIGHT FAIL
0,14this is just the start, yes?
09,01otakon
0,14you haven't seen ALL the system has to offe
0,14*offer
13right
09,01it works better in practice than it sounds
oh fine
09,01just sit back and watch
I would hope so
13being the start i can already see this has lots of potential to be awesomeness
:[
bc every thing I've read so far says the combat is the weakest part in the gaem

And that was the last time we ever saw him...
This seriously is called The Matrix?
09,01Shizuka you going to sleep? D:
09,01no, Information Matrix
13jaja.. tired...
gnight Shizuka
09,01basically think of it as the notebook from L.A. Noire
...
Too bad I don't know what L.A. Noire is.
ugh, not LA Noire
11,01Night Shizuka
WHAT??1!!
tchuss Shizuschlafen
09,01L.A. Noire is great
09,01and night Shizu
That guys a total ass, by the way.
Its cool, but everytime I tried to catch someone in a lie... my guy goes ballistic and just accuses him of burning down the whole town
It is the sequal to True Crime:Streets of L.A.
he's a total cranky doodle donkey

When rubix cubes go bad...
Is that a goddamn cube/
Cubix
...
night Shizuschlafen sleep well dear
Really.
waiting
/me leaves
also, I think it would have helped to actually show what attacks the enemy uses when they execute them, since ALL THE ACTIONS look the same if they're following a pattern it's hard to tell what it is
09,01: I
09,01you know it's really annoying when people do that
I can't brain today
NewDCD: I'm sorry, it's just my take on the game so far
09,01and they do, thing is, you have to brain
09,01If your ATTACK was successful
09,01they were using BREAK
if it failed, guard
Some people don't have brains, DCD.
if it tied, attack
ok fine
09,01if you get an EVEN -Equal Bloodshed-, he was using an Attack
09,01exactly
jeez it is 1 am atm
Do you fight him now?
I'm not exactly in tiptop form atm

This fight... seems to be going south...
SHE HAS HOW MUCH HP!?
Sorry if this is obvious... It seems you're slightly outmatched, my friend.
Oh shit
she's using Break alot man!
09,01Servant battles in the Arena are prohibited
09,01you basically have to only survive three turns
09,01so it's no biggie
Oh.
Well, then.
well good lord man you couldn't have put up a fight?
.-.
09,01not really...here's where the Information Matrix system comes nto play
no nvm sorry
but... you use swords...
That came out the completely wrong way, I retract my statement and apologize
09,01Archer actually uses a BOW THAT FIRES SWORDS
he did give a menacing stare though
09,01he's that badass
*brain asplodes*
Whoa.
WHOA
09,01when you gain extra notches of the Information Matrix, you can also see your opponent's attacks
09,01so yeah
So, your goal now is to sneak around and gather all the info you can?
That's remarkably simple.
You're fighting a.... symbol?
...
An evil symbol
Apparently, he is.
well, it's no stranger than fighting a sphere or a cube...
I can't see anything.
Oh, there we go.
/me noms pizza righy making everyone hungry
now I'm hungry
Now a real opponent.
A goddamn insect.
Well, everyone's gotta start somewhere.
Oooh, Mr Poniator
Great enemy design game
YAY
09,01it's reflective of the fact that this is basically a game world
09,01kind of like a video game
um
xD
09,01inside the arena I mean
did anyone else get freaked out at the end of the MrPoniator video?
Na.
Imean just a bit
09,01I mean the arena is a "Virtual Training Ground"
It was obvious where that was going.
Oh man... It' 1:00 AM...

At my school, there was a short lived meme where people would wear shirts that said 'Free Hugs' on them
did Hugs ecentually get freed?
*eventually
oh god... Mass Effect 3 Cinematic Trailer... o.o i came...
What do you think?
so how's the ME3 Multiplayer? it good?
No everyone just gave each other free hugs
/me hugs CupcakeWarrior for free
i havent played the multiplayer yet, but i hear its decent
ah
Which is funny because hugging is against the rules at my school

What?
No hugging?

Buhahahahahaa!!!
Love and tolerance... Love and tolerance...

So the school doesnt like people showing displays of affection

Ah, screw this.
dumb religion is dumb
great school
I hate uber-religious people.
people can be what they want just dont force it onto others
On an unrelated note: >mfw there is a Celestia Street in my town
it's almost a foreign concept to me
get out, no wayy
That almost makes up for it.
/me hugs cupcakewarrior
Wait...

I would like to walk around in public with a DO NOT TOUCH sign around my neck, lol
I want to live there so bad
"borrow" the street sign
in the me3 faq they allways say "EA Origin Account", horribly written legal bull#### document
like all documents of the type?
needless to say, im now more pumped about playing ME3... that cinematic trailer was amazing
legal documents=instant bullshit
I wish they had a release date for Bioshock Infinite
11,01Don't buy ME3 on PC if you really want to buy it.
I wish they had a release date for Fighting is Magic
Hi ! I'm back.
It's ne ashinysky
11,01And if you have to, don't go on Bioware's forums.
11,01If you get banned there, you'll lose your games.
Nittany_Discord: untill the whole origin thing i was thinking of buying it
wait what?
lol serrious
We bronies need to find a desert, and upon it build a glorious city where there are ponies in every window, and every street is named after a pony... -Has gone on delusional rant-
that doesnt sound legal
11,01Serious.
i already preorded the game for PC Nittany_Discord... didnt cost me any money cause i had credit at gamestop :D
Mid, winning.
gamestop owns
/me is going to verify that and if its true he will never purchase an ea product
Even though I hate that song.
11,01That's good.
10,02Wow, sounds like real scumbags
11,01It's true.
lol
10,02What a coincidence.
11,01Search EA Origin Bans.
11,01They can do it under their EULA.
i never go on game forums anyway, so ill be fin
fine*
call of pony 4? LOL
lol Call of Duty
I'm not sure but i think theres probably enough farm land here that a City could be built if we get the various resource consents... otherwise try Australia
11,01CoD is fun. I wish they weren't published by Activision though.
its not Biowares fault that EA is a company of douchebags, they make my favorite games
you kind of have to worry about water and power supply though
11,01Yeah. Sad.
10,02Stream is up now
O_o

Pinkie Pie eats nothing but sugar, so she contracts diabetus and loses the ends of all four limbs. That's not going to stop Pinkie Pie though! She still bounces around, but instead of *spoing sproing sproing* it's *sproing* *splat* "Ow." *sproing* *splat* "Ow." With four bloody stump prints marking wherever she's been.

It doesn't understand food from no food..
Fridge you're supposed to have food!! :|
ahha

I go to get my Mc'Flurry

I could use a steak right about now
Dashie_Dashie, what is Lucid Dreaming? To dream of MLP?
so I can stab my fridge for not giving me milk! :|

Lucid dreaming is a dream that YOU can't control, and you can do anything you want.
Can*

KwakLad: What the hell is that?
damn types
hmm..

you know a bit of break bacon then bread on the other side of the bacon
YES?
my dreams are too random and out of control to pilot, LOL
bread not break

Have fun.

and yes it is times like these that you really don't want me on your minecraft server
Sucess!
TOY_PON3|Math: yea, about 20-30 minutes give or take
TOY_PON3|Math: They're taking it to Europe's highest court to find out if it violates and EU rights.
/me updated from 32bit win7 to 64bit whith a linux install still working
Kammerjunk: Oh okay

Oh hi.

I played Minecraft before it was cool.
Mfw I bought minecraft when it was the cheapest
:D
LOL
Dashie_Dashie: >.>
I got both so meh
10,02Like it Dashie_Dashie? :3
Terraria is 2D and has more goals than Minecraft.
Mfw when minecraft got lame updates
teh colors @_@
SuperBrony64 gave my Terraria so I enjoy it more
me*
As far as I'm concerned, Minecraft and Terraria are not comparable.
^
minecraft has 3d
fair call
/me is going to join now
terraria has legitmately got guns
But yeah, I prefer to play Minecraft of the two.
3d is.graphical and doesn't matter.
spin-offs, spin-offs everywhere
Hey, SB.
10,02Hai Kammerjunk ^_^
You should totally make a giant Celestia propaganda poster with the words "OBEY".
mfw I'm into Minecraft only for the creations ._.
Damnit!
10,02Kammerjunk lol
have to download java
10,02Maybe another time :3
Yeah, it takes a while.
Placebo was tryin to make a giant Rainbow Dash in Minecraft, he's almost finished, LOL
suuuu....might I join you fine minecraftians?
in dat servoi?
I see a little silhouette of an Enderman.
wtf is wrong with me.....
?
mfw I don't understand what's so great about minecraft .______________________.
it gets boring after awhile imo
10,02You can basically craft anything you want ^_^
10,02That's the cool part :D
TOY_PON3|Math: It's a giant Lego sandbox!
Now I want it even more... :(
/me slaps kammer
It's perfect to satisfy any OCD needs.
Hm...
but I admit building stuff is awesome
Let's all buy Garry's mod for Bronystate craft night!
Why, dshannon? D:
I'm with terrariA
Gmod?? LOL
.....lego? really?
/me getting ready to leave
Dashie_Dashie: I don't even know how to use Gmod I will NEVER know
Can you make a better analogy?
download minecraft, complains about java, start downloading java

With Minecraft, you can build whatever you wish if you have the blocks.
Gonna go now.
See you, MASF123.
read timed out ;A;
bye MASF123
Kammerjunk: And what Minecraft is about the same?
Cya everypony.
Depends on the mode.
lol
Granted, in Lego, you don't get to BE in your creaton.
Or fight Skeleton.
Wow.
Thats laggy.
Or be freaked out by an Enderman suddenly teleporting right in your face.
THE ALMIGHTY DIRT FORT
But it's expensive though...
SuperBrony64:
I'm poor...
don't worry
I know the location

Diggy Diggy
And then SB died.
/me takes out wallet and shows everypony he has lent in it :|

/me puts money in CD drive and tries to send it to TOY_PON3|Math
00,10but yeah turn off the nukes and the reactors.
you should fax the money, it will work better
BSOD......FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I only played Minecraft once..the app version..
Reactors have ruined me more times than I care to count. It's all because I insist on having a gigantic underground base.
10,02i liek silliness :3
aha! IPS!
SuperBrony64: sometimes it will say its down even if its up
this silliness is what all true warriors strive for!

/me cries
Servers don't work

I don't even know why you ponies are up. It must be 3 AM or something in the US.

Kammerjunk: You're right...

not scary, but theyre intended to psychologically disturb, which means i dont care for them being posted in such an open area without any sort of disclaimer
that second one didnt actualy disturb me much
the text didnt mach the image imho

the voice is out of sync to the video
Fvorite pony: Pinkie pie favorite background pony Octavia
but.....erm......there are alot of creeps on there
omegle is funny
i know...
why is there another grap in the episodes
2 stranger bronies are such a rare occasion in one room
i once talked to a brony on omegle.... he was a liar
EQI is wierd
and then he just asked me asl?
what do u mean he/she's lying?
valoreins: they weren't really a brony
omg someone answerd my question :p
i question this on omegle: i used to wonder what friendship could be?
what did they say?
what did u get
did someone say my little pony?
ah the other stranger doesn't get it..
lol
i want them to sing along the pony anthem..
i wish i could shout at them,some of them are damn IDIOTS
suddenly the topic change about aliens...
ALIENS. their ALIENS
Hey

?
Im excited
Still really not in a good mood guysm
BronyinJapan: That's for the viewing of new episodes
omg 2 brony strangers! jackpot :D
thx Jim
Because there are so many people here during new episodes that it wouldn't fit in one chat room
Hey ThatsAShinySky
ThatsAShinySky: what's the matter?
Im so excited
and you just can't hide it?
all these reboots
I think I like it
Just.. detention and falling out with a friend.
:l
aww...
that sucks
ohai ThatsAShinySky
Who wants to heard something awesome
hi Derpy_at_work
me
i dont belive you are at work
moi
allso yes
Hey phase4.
Johnjoseco is going to draw my oc
: D
alright guys
who?
lets clear some stuff up
He is taking commisions
who is Dinky Doo?
cute
Dinky is the supposed daughter of Derpy
ofna01: Dinky Doo is Derpy's little sister
or sister
or daughter, not sure
:D
daughter
Dinky Doo is Ditzy (Derpy) Doo's daughter ofna01
Sounds exciting. Let's see this.
in the fanfictions she is the adopted dauthger of derpy
Lol.
adopted
That's is hilarious.
but she looks just like her!
Daughter is the most common explanation
:/
according to the fans at least, I've never seen it established as such in the actual show
;(
who is ditzy?
:'(
Thanks Jim :)
Ditzy is Derpy Iwubponiez
no she is not
silly
she could be
derpy is derpy :P
Derpy Hooves is the name the fans gave her
Phase4 in not on the clock yet
we've never seen them both in the same room
at the same time
sigh* how many ppl here actually saw ep 14?
"in not on the clock" ?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3sNeZNJPvw&feature=endscreen
how to you get the characters faces on the text
Iwubponiez: i did
season 1?
no season 2
where derpy is called derpy
every one hear should have seen every episode
mfw jj has mass effect art
ep 14 i think
Remember the Winter Wrap-Up episode? "Ditzy Do accidentaly went north to get the southern birds!" "That featherbrain!"
of season 2
Phase4 it means i havent started work yet
ah
squeee
ep 14, the last roundup
Iwubponiez: im watching it now, yeah i get called Kwak by friends irl Iwubponiez it doesnt mean thats my real name
yeah it should be derpy, but there is no evidence ...
if you havent seen it your not a brony
someone joined
tha
t would
be meh
ohai StickySyrup
hi StickySyrup
hai
ohai StickySyrup
i saw the counter go from 70 to 71
Hello StickySyrup
that means the chat is kinda dead
:/ :( :'(
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O9HVV-vPMM&feature=related
I still think Derpy's real name is Ditzy Do. ah well
D:
ITS NOT
FUSGDFHNSHGJHNSD FK /
rainbow dash said NOW CAREFUL DERPY and talked to her directly and ppl dnt believe her name was on the show but they believe its ditzy when shw was not actually there
season 2 ep 14 rainbow dash calls derpy, derpy
nickname?
pinkie rage is possibly one of the most terrifying things in existance
CountDoofus: it is Ditzy Derpy is a nickname like Kwak is for me
i thought Ditzy was her daughters name
They said that Ditzy Doo went north to get the southern birds in the winter wrap up episode
But we didn't see if it was derpy
naw, that was dinky
i thought it wasnt that big a deal
yeah.. dinkie
dinky
stickysyrup : her daughter is dinky
ma bad u guyz
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/1.jpg found a copy of this image on my hdd :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsCqH6sR564&feature=related
FOURTH WALLL SHATTERED
... I just don't know what went wrong
TOO MANY PIECES
its not canon that she is the daughter but people are hopeing it is Iwubponiez
physics has taken a major blow after the last episode
It does sound like derpy going north.
ya i know
"i just dont know what went wrong!" *smacks into pole*
KwakLad: i beg to differ
that's not breaking the fourth wall. that's putting C4 around it and blowing it to kingdom come
get hit by lighting
http://youtu.be/dzKfac18IYQ?t=17m8s They say Ditzy Doo here
Phase 4 firstly is supposed to be a woman in a lake with a sword, not man in river with fish... but i'd still have fun trying to rule a nation with a fish
man... finding 2 bronies in one omegle room is like searching for gold in a dump...
O.o
whats omegle
Luck.
lol talk to strangers
its so wrong
Omegle is a place where you can talk to strangers
Chatroulette basically.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3a9i7grkus&feature=related

Hello everypony
lol
hi Fazana
hiya
Hi
Fazana: have you ever watched godzilla?
I had indegestion earlier :3
hello Fazana
Ow
Godzilla, yes, loads, LOADS.
hey Fazana
I have a full bloody shelf full of godzilla stuff
Fazana: which one was your favorite?
I'm not sure
I got a few faves
which monster
The mechagodzilla one was brill
the only godzila film i saw was final wars
and movie
alexxm: i have seen almost all of them
ohai Fazana
05aaaaaaaand home
I've seen pretty much all of the good ones
ohai Wrek
Welcome Wrek
i love mothra
ohai wrek
Hello Wrek
hey Wrek
But I've left all the terrible ones
hi Wrek
hey Wrek
Wrek! :D
Hello, Wrek
welcome wrek
Fazana: favorite monster
is it stream time?
player of music and supplier of awesome artwork
One sec, trying to remember name
Ghidora
Fazana: awesome
Fazana: the cyborg or the original?
no screen?
I prefer original, but the mechaGhidora was pretty badass as well
agreed
Fazana: my favorite was mothra
I havent seen Mothra in ages
Fazana: because my first one was godzilla vs mothra
the one with the eveil mothra
*evil
I think the first one I ever watched was The final wars, got into it, and my dad had literally millions of japanese collectorware
I also like Gamera :3
http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/12/10/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-mane-six-cupcakes/
those cupcakes
my second favorite would have to be.....
i can't remember it was a plant mixed with the blood of godzilla
how about we do a godzilla movie night
YES!!!!!!
yay godzilla :D
that be awesome
Why does AJ have M&Ms?
Naturally, it would be dash, no?
everyone vote for a godzilla movie for next week then
godzilla vs. mothra
or skittles
A godzilla vs gamera would be so awesome
alexxm: which one?
Fazana it represent the 3 different colored apples
i don't know whichone do u want to see
or godzilla final wars
*zilla
didn't that already happen
Ironicly, the last episode of Godzilla (final wars) is the most explanatory one
Zilla was aweful D:
alexxm: what do you mean?
ikr
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/Gamera1.jpg badass Gamera shot here ^^
alexxm: yeah that's why i want to see it
same here
i heard their gonna make another amerivan godzilla movie
Tbh, it wouldn't suprise me
you know it was the avgn's godzilla month that got me into it
i hope they include monster fights
Zilla ended at a cliffhanger
i heard it' going to be a man in a costume for the 2nd try
alexxm: their probably gonna buck that up too
If you've watched that megashark vs giant croc I forget the real name, you'll know peeps in suits are better than effects
Fazana: i know i watched it and it sucked the special effects were just horrible
dont look at this or you'll die of a HHNNNNG attack http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/12/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-sorry-if-i-made-you-die-of-a-hhnnnng-attack/

11,01I wonder if anything is going to be streamed around 2000Z or later.
im debating whether or not to like the status update on facebook that the girl I like is single without feeling like a stalker...
^that's the worst
I cant draw ponies standing up.....uuuuggh!!
I know how that is…
Could you send me these playlists/
Any of you from BronyNet?
Kipkat07, dang, lol
I wudnt like the status O.o but you have to show Some affection
11,01I'm afraid to tell girls online or in real-life that I like them because I'm afraid of being called a stalker. It's happened before.
o_o
Wrek: Could you send me these playlists?
back
11,01It's happened once.
I never know when girls like me.... lol, ive had about 6 Goregeous girls want me...but stop talking to me becuz i 'ignored' them :'(
11,01The girl I like now knows I'm not a stalker.
Nittany_Discord: go on
BronyNet, anyone?
RaveBrony: you jerk
:'(
Nittany_Discord: i wan't to hear everything!
I care not for girls to be blunt
RaveBrony: i'm just kidding
I can cope alone just as fine
Oh.... hehe :P
RaveBrony: but seriously why would you ignore them?
Fazana: blunt?
I didnt ignore them, I just didnt realize they were flirting with me... and that gave them the thot that i didnt return feelings for them :(
not be sharp
dont care
blunt = not care
oh
or
TBH
Being blunt /= Being frank
11,01Well, it was a girl pretending to be nice on a forum. I liked her and told her, and she went neutral with that. I joined a forum she ran and supported her, but ended up booting me off for "stalking."
lol @ nittany_discord
Hi Frank
11,01It turns out that she had identity problems and was lying about herself online though.
oh shaddap
Aw, Nittany_Discord :(
Nittany_Discord: wow

Oh dang O_o
Nittany_Discord: was she a man?
Anyway, I need food, brb
Nittany_Discord: was she old

Wrek: Mys spotify is Lv100Charizard. I'd appreciate it if you shared some playlists

Nittany_Discord: oh well almost evrybody lies about there identity online
11,01She was 17, but I wasn't going to date a damn 17-year-old.

05why would you be accused of pedophilia? we wasnt under 15 :|
11,01Dunno.
11,01I wouldn't date a 15-year-old.
Some girl in my school (age 16) is dating a 21 year old :o
ugh
yeah..
thats pretty normal
so it's considered pedophlia is you are 14
thats weird
Hi guys. I'm back from my walk and… oh
11,01Well, pedophilia is sexual acts with a minor though.

75 degrees in February. Thanks, BBC, for inventing Global Warming.
hi PartyCannon
11,01http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/115981-Fox-News-Criticizes-Studio-Ghiblis-Latest <- You're going to love this.
hi Kammerjunk
so i dont get why people complain when someone likes ponys lol
Wrek, can you draw a colt/stallion sometime? Thats mainly what i try to draw and id like to see how you do it :o
11,01Global warming is not an invention.
Hi, mario_pony.
what softwre is he using to draw
i was listening to the fox news about bronies.. they just agree to the bald man's opinion...
i mean wat the buck?!
According to Fox News, bronydom is as bad as terrorism.
it's fox new. nothing to talk about
oh no
were comen to yo country
They said "50/50".
huggen you
11,01See the Red Eye skit when they went to Bronycon?
05there is only 1 good thing i have ever seen comign from fox
definately terrorism
That one was silly, Nittany_Discord.
Red Eye?
what's that Wrek?
DaniilScit: A Fox News segment or something.
explain. both of you
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hSbyTteS-M
mmmmm........ peanut butter sandwich and Cheez-its
Goddam when part 30 gonna be translated
05this
That Redeye segment with Applejack was kinda funny.
05http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOaCemmsnNk
O_o
ah that video
what's that about?
/me tries to burst into flames but is too tired ~_~
hi Midnight_Tempest
05watch it
05and you'll get it
okay then
what'S that redeye segment?
Wrek: I got 40 seconds in before I couldn't resist laughing at them being hypocrites.
05exactly
whoa i'm laging :(
I'm back
Had some cerial
what software is being used to draw
The best thing I ever saw come out of Fox News was "hackers on steroids".
11,01Hollywood's liberal agenda." <- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztVMib1T4T4&feature=related
11,01Those SOPA/PIPA-supporting fuckers liberal?
I <3 THATVIDEO
Bloody SOPA
How about I say NOPA
SOPA is down, though.
what about PIPA and ACTA?
i thought sopa was dead..6_9
ACTA against ACTA
11,01It is.
both parties support SOPA but for different reasons.
i ACTA against ACTA!
it respawn into ACTA
Apparently, ACTA has been suspended for ratification.
Wait
05brb
They were RATting people?
They're taking it to the highest court in Europe.
11,01Enough. I didn't mean to start a SOPA/PIPA/ACTA debate.
oh
no.
okay :OP
alrightythen
RAT = Remove Administration Tools
It's like AB tutor control or Teamspeak
what about a PCIP debate?
I remember having RAT once.
That was fu.
fun*
But the victim doesn't get to control the PC
11,01I was just stating how Fox News thought that a right-wing group like Hollywood is liberal.
lol rick santorum XD
Basically, if you get RATted by soemone who wants data, you're bucked.
no madder how hard we will try sooner or later the internet will be Ruined by some stupid law.
I'd rather it be later
me too
or some stupid hacker
lol
This new, environmentalism is evil thing is killing me.
11,01RAT? It's that a DRM-removal tool?
Nope
It's a very nasty hack
That, and this new War on Women.
Oh no. I meant that I had the client software, not that I was a victim of it.
well, i have a great deal of respect for that Judge Napolitano guy... i had never heard of him till now but, kodos to him
I thought Janet Napolitano was a woman.
what drawing software is that
Illustrator?
SAI
ok thnx
ugh... i hope the pain in my face is only a sinus infection and not something worse... like a sudden case of death v_v
lol
hi everypony im backkkkk

11,01There's been a good bit of trolling in the MLP community lately.
Yeah...
Jim: why does everypony make fun of sarah jessica parker?:(
I don't mind humanized ponies valoreins
Happens when events catch troll attention spans
oo ok
then my project still continues
It's kind of an ongoing gag on the internet that Sarah Jessica Parker looks like a horse
like that bot a couple of minutes ago
it kept calling me stupid
Jim: she does
remembers how Sarah Jessica Parker was sold to us as the cute girl.
she was?
O.o
I thought she was just a narrator like Morgan Freeman
lol
didn't you see Hocus Pocus or… … that one romantic comedy (To the Wikipeter!)
11,01I don't see a problem with humanized ponies (antromorphs).

Tovler I was going to respond to that, but thought better of it
i'm gonna go look up chains of olympus
05back

It was some 80s movie. That's all I can narrow it down to.

god,why is that picture so badass?
Johnjoseco is opening commisions soon
btw, is this the same drawing Wrek started working on yesterday?
nope
yesterday it was Twi
those feathers look like kick ass blades
Midnight_Tempest: every single government has its own faults.
as does it's people
yeah I know, but after Twilight, he started on another
thats what i thought Sundaysmile
is the picture a reference to something?
i wouldnt know
not sure
I remember him doing a Rarity Gunslinger pic lately
i do too
that was cool
must be part of a theme
badass pony theme
Sundaysmile: hes doing a syndicate themed pony set
oooo
very nice
elaborate for me?
i dont play Syndicate
1 sec
ohh maybe hes doing different now
i remember a game called syndicate... it was mid 90's old...
sadly it's not on steam yet
05probably wont be knowing EA
Gentlemen, BEHOLD
05fuck EA
though hopefully will be once the remake comes out
05fuck origin, hard and without mercy
it's being made by EA?
I have made THIS THING!
There will be blood....
Our arrows will block out the Sun!
Then we will makes friends in the shade?
Why not.
all this hate for EA... shame it wont stop them from raping peoples wallets
My only gripe with em is the way they treat their consumer base
yoyoyo
they DO fund decent enough games, but they are a group of assholes when you get down to it
greeting djackson
EA is pretty desperate to retain their status as the asshole of the gaming industry.
i dont normally buy games anymore, but im getting ME3... oh wait, i had credit at gamestop so the game was pretty much free for me :D suck it EA
ohai djackson
it's pretty much chisled in stone already Kammer
oh,wrek,u so crazeeee
05not buying ME3 either
05i want to but i wont.
I can't afford to buy ME3, though not because of cash
Sundaysmile: Yeah, but they don't seem to be the only ones who want the questionable honour.
any reason?
05origin exclusive
Wrek true story
I'm not gonna buy ME3 because origin is shit
Shame I'm terrible with names, I can't quite remember the other company.
wrek
may i make a suggestion?
they're trying to make a EA Steam equivalent
EA and Valve need to make up
^
or EA just needs to stop acting like asshats
anyone seen the new valve logo intro for DOTA 2?
nope
djackson yup, I like
Valve+EA=Valvea?
its creepy as hell
05Electronic Valve
llol
that actually sounds pretty good
Wrek Valve Arts
*takes off sunglasses* mother of god...
for people who havent seen it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6JXDiz0C-s
EA - Challenge Everything - But not that. Or that. Or this. And no you can't do this.
whassmatta midnight?
Woah!!
This IS creepy O_o
i still cant tell if shes smoking
^
i swear, if EA does manage to buy a company like Valve... i'll quit gaming all together...
EA Games-Challenge Everything. EXCEPT ANYTHING YOU ACTUALLY WANT
isn't that just the HL2 intro cept he moves?
yeah
yup
its creepy
thats kinda boring
wouldn't call it creepy
i wanted to see the valve being shoved into his head... that would be creepier
though I was expecting some heavy nightmare fuel when you said it
yay, nightmare fuel... mfw i dont have nightmares anymore
i dont even have dreams

Wrek on EqD? IMPOSSIBRU!
^^
nicely done
NOPE
CHUCK TESTA
(:
That's not impossibru
It was so awesome that it made it there
finally!
impossibru is ME getting on EQD
Indeed, i can only dream of being on EQD :(
Wrek,he's got the talent
^
ofna01 no i am the one immpossible to get on EQD
I don't understand the obsession honestly
cus i dnt even draw :D
What obsession?
me neither
of wanting to be on EQD
it makes you part of a sort of "elite" group of artist
the best of the best
sundaysmile look at the page vewies
Oh, i just want to draw well enough to be recognized, its doesnt Have to be EQD :P
and yeah, what ofna01 said
only elite goes to EQO
EQD
thats why we want to be on EQD
:)
i honestly think wrek could be on EQD for everyone of his drawings
^^
his skil.....pardon my french....is just damn amazing
I just took a which pony are you test and im Flutterfhy
dat french :D
I don't know about that.
oui
Doesn't need to be on EQD to be appreciated though
Fluttershy*
lucky you,mr. commie
This drawing needs to be about 20% cooler if you ask me.
ofna01: :3
Krakass: i think it already is
Sundaysmile indeed, not on EQD != not good
LOLOLOL
LOL
a round of applause for wrek
:D
Yeah, like i draw scenery too (but i dont show anyone, becuz its not the best). When it comes to ponies, EQD means your ponies are awesome :P
lol
20% Deader?
Dat 20% Deader
i cant read it
good evening
dat english :D
Hi derpy_pony
ohai derpy_pony
deader?
evenin derp
put it this way.... Cupcakes was posted on EQD...
it was quality
20% deadlier?
well writin
Yes, deader. The english may not be correct, but you get the point. No need to be grammar nazis
Hey its was VERY well written!! just....bleh
read what he said about it
Radu: What are you, a dictionary?
O U
:D
NO U
Sundaysmile: to be honest i liked that fan fic for what is was tring to be....
:o
Im Estonian,my english really suck,so...
thats cool
very much so
05puns have no need to be gramatically correct
05tsk tsk
20% deader?
and the only reason they said they'd host it was because they were pressured into it
Indeed :)
I searched for fan fics, but I never found fics about fans
So I'd imagine skill has little to do about it, only popularity
crap......i need to fix my knife
O.o
because there are a LOT of great artists and writers out there who aren't featured on EQD but probably should be if it's for folks who are good at what they do
That doesn't sound ominous or anything.
the bolts loose
bolts ARE loose,more then one
I agree, SUndaysmile
*Sundaysmile
hahah
/me bobs his head to this Awesome songs beat

Wrek i have been playing with one of those for the last half hour

im holding my Butterfly knife right now
h
00,10I see you have plaied knifie spoonie before.
:o
i could probably have it out before you could blink
I picked up one of these a few years ago. http://derpy.me/R02re
and then Silver Spoon shows her special talent
05thing is ofna01
05you wouldnt see me
hahah
05cause eitehr i would have 1: my logn range rifle or 2: my axe
And I just picked up one of these last month http://www.surefire.com/EW-05
so ninja
not bad krak
Oh ofna01 i didnt mean it as an insult to you for having the knie, it just looks like a butterknife :p
00,10heh, the installer for my video driver has clips for masseffect 3 in it.
I only have a hunting knife and i Own a katana...but i dont have it atm
probably cuts like one too
i know XD
05but how will you learn if you dont cut tourself when you do it wrong?
^
yes
Wrek perhaps they like pain?
KwakLad, I'm now picturing him pulling it out in a fancy restaurant to butter his roll.
being tossed in the deep end is the best way to sink or swim
Rofl!
Krakass: AWE-some!
So, no episode this week?
http://www.bladeplay.com/item--United-Cutlery-8-Black-Triple--9087
when did we start talking bout knifes?
nope
!cd
Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 8 days, 23 hours, 13 minutes, 19 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
Nope, Radu
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
I forgot that
just ordered that a couple of days ago
Krakass: But making a big show of it like he was gonna stab waiting staff
was gleefully expecting a fluttershy ep
next week new epi
Kwak
05putting your hoof down
05could be poor fluttershy goign assertive again
Where do you all get this money!? :'(
fluttershy yay
05anyways
05dinner
ofna01?
thats going to be a fluttershy one i just know it
it was only 15 bucks apiece.....
See you later, Wrek
Enjoy, Wrek!
so what will be streamed on sat instead? the re-run or something else?
ttfn wrek
Bye Wrek
it is -.-
I'd go through pony withdrawl
Dat angle and fitting music
Wrek laters
only 8 more episodes in this season
yay
bye wrek
o_o
and then season 3 in nine months afterwards
what will we do in summer?
Rewatch ALL the episodes?
derpy_pony the same thing we did last summer
going on a fanwork binge
visit ponycon?
But how can seaon 3's intro beat season 2?
What's better than Discord?
by taking the italian version
Disquord
9 months :O
krakass they will think of something
discord was not that good, imo
maybe less wubponies
was an exagerration
@pony
Boo.
more lazers
more CMC
Well as long as they don't get a shark and jump over it on a motorcycle.
yay scoots episode
well that Twilight from the future ep might be a sign of things to come?
maybe next season they will get the marks "finaly"
scoot will never get an episode
I want an ep in season 3 in which the CMC get their cutie marks.
she is the milhouse of mlp ^^
derpy_pony NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I think if anything they will get their marks in a feature length movie
she is my fav CMC
ANd yes, I'm one of the ones who thinks that'll happen
Spike is best CMC
I fear this movie
spike? CMC? seems legit
it will be horrible and childish
likewise... usually movies of tv shows tend to tie up loose ends
probably
and abruptly
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TtGQnyPZ6g
derpy, not really, since Hasbro is now aware of bronies.
We can neither confirm nor deny that FiM is only 3 seasons long at this time
I really hope for a full length theatre only mlp movie soon. Imagine all them bronies
so reminds me of kryton
Sadly, I don't think FiM will get more than 5-6 seasons
that would be glorious radu
the fanservice doesn't make it better...hasbro might try to pander the loudest voices on sites like ponychan...not sure if I want that
Hey BronyState :3
radu dont say that kind of silly stuff
I demand 9000 seasons.
Radu it would be good enough IMO; I hate shows that drag on forever
Hi ScootaChicken
ohai ScootaChicken_
Y'know, My Little Pony has been going for about 30 years.
just pointing that out.
Hello all...
ohai Paradise92
hey ScootaChicken
agree on that partyCannon like Naruto Bleach and one piece
no stream?
The creepy images can start mwuhahahaha
Conspiracy Keanu: What if they're gonna start a G5 that's gonna be even worse than G3.5?
hey Paradise92
mario_pony: Wrek is out for a while, he will maybe come back to stream later
fim is running good, keeping it, even at lower budget, is better than trying g5 with completely new staff and concepts
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1330018396426.png
oh okay just checking
didn't one of the voice actors already confirm they were hired for season 3?

Paradise92 isn't going to get banned unless he does this around the mods.
radu...no one except the regulars knows that
Cake! or Death?
However, having said that.
j
Wrek: ping.
ScootaChicken if the mods are as audity as I am, they keep logs
Rofl, Iwubponiez :D

I'd recommend breem
Eenope
STREAM PLOX
Wrek
I have no stream D:
I've just come back from watching Nascar
i love nascar
CRAP DID I MISS IT?!?!
There's Nascar mid-day on a Thursday?
Only practice
Oh
is it a theatrical event?
meh
oh my those are awesome sketches Krakass
wat
Nothing happened basically
Krakass, did you draw that??
Faz
i don't get nascar
To be frank, a wasted of a few hours
05i love shadowsquirrels work
who's your favorite driver
05he's so awesome :D
mario it's a race
They're making a left turn!
I dunno
24 for me
There's quite a few
RaveBrony, does that look anything like a stick figure?
I'd say Juan Pablo Montoya
Rofl :D
If not, then no I didn't draw it.
poor jeff got crashed out last race,he would've probably won
But I also like Dale Earnhardt Jr
Im totally drawing those eyes....omg :o
Jeff Gordon
oh hey, itÄs back
yeah
Yeah, thatkinda scared me
Stream is back up? Just wondering
05so
I'm kinda new to Nascar
which band is this?
05time to draw sexie eyes, cute eyes or anything?
i still remember Dale Earnhardt Sr
Radu: yes it is
Yes it is, gladly no refresh needed :)
ummm
Been an F1 fan for about 10 years.
what is the point to nascar?
Sexy eyes with firearms?
13vector und color~
sexie cute anythings please
Yes!! Very Detaled eyes please, Wrek :)
Sexie eyes!
Always a safe combo
Yeah, I remember the news on DE Sr
i was watching the race
I was 4 then, so I probably wouldn't have the patience to watch ovals
your the same age as me
Oh man....now my older bro is blaring Nascar on his tv...fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
O_O
i spy an eye
I remember when I was 6, and I was watching Formula 1 with Dad eating sweetcorn <3
Oh, and Mario, Nascar is speed and consistency
Rave Brony, just blare the MLP intro
MAX VOLUME
I wish I was born earlier
anyone here play Hatoful Boyfriend?
MAXIMUUUM TROOOLLLIIIING
Then I could watch Senna kick arse
I shall!!! :$
Eye see you.
how come there are soo many people on here but only a few actually get in on the conversation?
NAscar vs MLP
i used to wonder what nascar could be
RD would win.
mlp
i have no clue....
until you shared it's magic with me
RD in a nascar
RD+Nascar= 20% cooler
Replace that ass of a driver Kyle Busch
RD will have no effect in Nascar, since it's involved car driving.
oh, are there actually some people here watching the Duels?
is it paced faster? than the studio version?
me Mirror
I'd love to see RD in the Olympics
I need to win the lottery so I can sponsor a car
13quidditch: it's like the WNBA divided by curling
Huge RD logo down the side.
I would Sponser McLaren
13quidditch! what your wife sees when you make her watch baseball!
mirror who are you going for?
Jeff Gordon
:DDD
failing that, Hendrick
me too!
13quidditch! there's actually videos of people trying to play it on youtube!
I would sponser Montoya
with "Shout today!"
It would match him perfectly
Quick. Guess the pony.
its a pony
I say Rarity
umm
no.....
not pinkie
Quiddich: When you watch inmates try to catch a snitch
Trixie
I say OC
fluttershy :P
If you ever watched Montoya in F1, "Bucking Raikkonnen, what a bucking idiot!"
possibly,mister commie
It's obviously Spike.

RainbowJack

Hello dr-whooves...how was your trip?

Excellent

Landed upside down
Shizuka i saw the link...for quiddich...
CountDoofus: Yes! that'd be awesome
i got turned around,and it flipped about 3 times
It was a bucker to try and get out, until the marshalls flipped my car
what is this cuz it aint photoshop
Then I got a bit of whiplash because they didn't do it carefully >:c
who is that Sexy mare?
i climbed out without them flipping it
I kinda couldn't
Luna?
Jim: thanks. consider it as an upcoming project :)

The steering wheel was stuck on the bloody car

I feel sorry for you D:
oops
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Dem eyes looking cool
10,02Paradise92: It's up to the discretion of the streamer really. But in general, I think it's a bit rude.
for 3 weeks :'(
By the way, was the video Nope.avi supposed to be only "Nope"?
of all the worst thing that could happen
this is
THE
WORST
POSSIBLE
THING
:D
Dat Combo breaker
/me gets her drama sofa
X3
Combo finisher
SuperBrony64 ok so then if that is the thing then prepare for some youtube links cause i found some funny
SuperBrony64 stuff
Paradise92: :|
You know I think im the only brony in my town
Forever alone
Which town?
CCCR if people other than me can put links then i shall put also
RainbowJack: why would you link that it's funny but perverted
You never know AwsomeNick, I thought I was the only too
AwsomeNick: me too
Dat vitreous humor
i think im the only MLP fan in my school v_v
Any Pudsey People Here Den?
Paradise92: at least dont put too many
But one day I found out that one of my friends actually was a brony
Nahh
Nice eyes you've done, Wrek :3
mario_pony i just found it funny
I convinced my sister to like mlp
And that link that was put from RainbowJack wasn't PG13
13Breaking rules isn't okay just because "someone else did".
When i first heard of bronies i thought it sounded stupid
Shizuka then why didn't he got a warning?
Same but then i took freindship to the knee
13You worry about yourself.
Shizuka that wasn't a PG13 thing
I started watching pony YTPMV'S and i wanted to see the show to see whatall the fuss was about and i loved it <3
Shizuka i am worrying about the chat now...
Pretty cool Scavender
Scavender, needs more Big Mac
I really think it is unfair...
so does anyone else have to deal with parents who talk about lady boy's during diner or is that just me
Im gonna go look up if there are any bronies were I live
Just you o_o
alexxm: it is just you
Very nice, Scavender :)
That eye painting looks awesome
OOOOH Wrek I LOVE THIS KICKAPOO SONG!
HAHAHA it came up with brownie recipes LOL
JACK BLACK!
There lived humble
family
i think one of my friends could be a brony but im not sure
lol
TRy it.
You know this song?
same here cccp
Oh the dragons
balls
were blazing
xD
when i stepped to his cave
I know now of my friends are bronies :D
CCCP: Go whilstleing FiM songs around him, he'll understand
fuckaloo?
best pony
YAY this song is just plain awesome
Lol!
Jim: i will try that
fuckaloo made me think of appleloosa or some reason
o_o words sound the same
like winter wrap up
Bronies need a secret code they can wear on shirts that only true bronies understand then we could unite andd bronify everyone
^
MLP4LYFE theres the code
when does the narwhal bacon?
This SOng is from a movie called "The Pick of Destiny"
xD
Awesome movie
20% cooler in (put address here)?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2399/
is this wrong?
2o seconds flat?
around where I live, I am pretty sure that only bronys would know what 'the pink unicorn with metal stuff on it' is from
Paradise92: it looks wrong
hey mario_pony
o_o
purple*
Paradise92: lol xD
:D @ that lyric
why are you using my nickname!?!?!
YOU ARE HUNGRY FOR THE ROCK!
In the

^
String_Shredder yes

String_Shredder it is from a movie "The Pick of Destiny"
I gave up caring about most other things
what color of coat and hair should my Riddler have? I'm thinking brown coat with green hair, with streaks of purple
i wanted to see Pick of Destiny but i didnt
okay
Copy the eye's outline? Check.... Copy the dark colors used for the eye and lashes? Check....See Wrek use 'lighting' tools on eye? Snap my pencils :[
guess what otakon... theres nothing wrong with me... DOCTORS ARE USELESS!
Red mane with black streaks
Midnight_Tempest: um, what?
13Midnight_Tempest: you have pony pox
13sorry to tell you
Just cus there my fave colors
Shizuka: talk some sense into him!
XD
also, brb
if liking ponies is a disease, I WANT NO CURE
ummm.......this song makes me feel weird
otakon: i went to the doctor and told him whats wrong, he said it was nothing >_<
this is so amazing
XD
CountDoofus: me too
Doctor is a brony too? XD
I used to think I could watch wrek and pick up some tips and techniques. But then I get so busy watching what he's doing that I don't pay attention to the how.

05so far so good
How old is flash animation? to my knowledge its somewhere under 10 years
eeyup
Coolbluemidnite: I'm OK with that
xD
Goodbye everyone, good luck Wrek on the drawing c:
It's a little over 10 years
Indeed, Wrek :)
Byee radu
Coolbluemidnite i dont think anyone would complain at that
I know this because Badger badger badger was done in Flash
In 2001
bye Radu
Coolbluemidnite: wouldnt WE have to break the 4th wall for that.
Yesh and then we would all take turns hugging fluttershy ^_^
Good point.....
:)
Cya Radu
nah i'll just call pinkie but i need a phone first XD
I break the 4th wall on a daily basis
xD
/me brings her cell
I'm hittin' the cider bar with pinkie
^lol
It cuts off about a 30 minutes off my school journey
If you went to equestria what would the 1st thing you would do there?
well i'll be off guys gonna play some LoL
make friends!!
run naked through ponyville drunk.
XD
I would go and find Rarity, and try live with her :3
Depends if you turn pony or not when you get there
just kidding.
xD
I would most likely succeed because one is quite high class
I'd be a black and white pony with poofy black hair :3
I just wanted to say that you guys are awesome
I'd actually run naked trough ponyville while this song was playing.
I dont know what i wud do in equestria :D
Dashie, I would rather play Benny Hill if you did that
Maybe, rave with Vinyl Scratch? :)
If do turn pony, spend ages finding out how 4 legs walking works
I'd go to pinkie pie and listen to her sing random songs
Thank you stallion1, if you're refering to the audience of course.
^
Gotta trot before you can gallop
X3
yea
then run around in circles like a derp trying to fiond out what my cutie mark is
for real though, I'd HUG ALL THINGS.
I'll just get my car and make ponies jelly
Pshh, id be on 2 legs the whole time :D
Take Rarity for a ride
trying to keep my balance...
rainbow dash can beat any car
lolwut
I'd take over princess celestia and be ruler of equestria
If I was a pony, I'd wish to be a pegasus
My car goes about 80 MPH :3
i'd wish to be a alicorn
she's banish you to the walk within the fourth wall
or to the moon
you'd be stuck between rifts
wall*
Dashie_Dashie That's an awful fate.
If Dashie could beat my car, I could probably beat her in a flying comp though
Don't try to overthrow celestia xD
shes best dictator
XD i wont lol
I mean... princess
I fly at around 1200 MPH
Nah i'd go to the cake store and pig out those cakes look good
fazana hahahahahahaha :D:D oh you were being serious ................ lemme laught even harder :P
Rainbow dash flies at Mach 10
dealwithit
and im back folks
Welcome back :D

Oh well, cars = better than wings

Howdy CrazyBronyDonut.
Heullo CrazyBronyDonut
CrazyBronyDonut: shouldnt your name be crazybronut?

Wrek.

Indeed.
that is one awesome drawing
Oh my.

I wanna draw like that but im still stuck on stick men e.o
Hello
00,10lol recently
Everyone new is joining all at once :O
05i need to use my juices while i have'em
hello.
hello mrsleepyguy
i hear you
Howdy MrSleepyguy.
ohai MrSleepyguy
Allo MrSleepyguy.
00,10Wrek you have been drawing like nonstop sence december that I know of.
Hi, everypony!
Allo Pegasister16
ohai Pegasister16
Yay another pegasister :D
hiya Pegasister16 and MrSleepyguy
hello Pegasister16
Hi, Pegasister16
Drawing looks proper epic now.
Well Pegasister16, how ya doing?
Dat engi theme.
Do I sense an engineer?
Coolbluemidnite: I had the same train of thought, until I tried hand-copying existing images. maybe that's a start?
I'm well. How is everypony?
Yay! I'm not the only pegasister!
Maybe :o im ok at copying stuff
I wish I still had my guitar, I loved playing tunes like these.
-highfive- :D
Fine, with a hint of headache.
Pegasister16 I'm doing pretty well. Working on show notes at the moment.
highhoof
^_^
So are we moving away from Brony being a neutral term?
Huh?
What do you mean Meanwhile ?
?
00,10for some resion I read that as fine with a hint of headcrab.
Woohoo, I'm not the only brony here.
idk i always thought pegasister was girl and brony was boy
I guess some people prefer to use pegasister others just say brony
What Sumica said.
Meanwhile that's a gray area to be honest.
Sumica, hostiles inbound.
I like the "Art of War" TF2 music
Girls can call themselves whatever they want to call themselves.
^
No, pegasister is the female term for brony
Yeah.
Ha! Im back! :)
but many pegasisters hate that term
I always thought pegasister sounded a bit weird.
:o
Welcome back RaveBrony
05maybe it is
Otherwise girls will be 'bros'. Awkward.
Thanks :P
00,10Still not a fan of the pegasisisisisister term.
Im a fan of my little pony thats all i know
05but a majority consider brony an unisex term
my friends who are girls go by either
05and the majority is always right
Lolnope.
Sumica.exe is not responding.
Yea i'll just go by either
lol
but I still prefer brony imo
I agree with Wrek, but i didnt think of it that way
So I've been thinking about doing a voice audition for Mane6.
Personally yeah I think brony is unisex.
nods
/me agrees
I wanna do a rarity one but i know this would sound weird i sound kinda good as a male rarity o.o
00,10may the farce be with you Pegasister16
we'd better conform to the whims of the "many" then. Pegasister, ftw (that was needlessly combative)
the original term is /b/rony
which pony are you thinking Pegasister16 ?
Meh, i didnt think of it as unisex, but yeah, its understandable :P
Pegasis or Brony, I don't pay much attention to gender tbh.
Fluttershy and Applebloom
I hear TF2
Pegasister just sounds..weird and I'm a girl
Bronyzilla: one day that's going to come back to bite you in the flank...
00,10dat tf2 waltz
pinkie eeyup
TF2
:o
Ohai Meanwhile
Let's all play TF2 again.
:>
Wrek, got "The Art of War"?
I downloaded TF2! But...i suck at it :D
I suck at TF2 :(
I headshotted wrek yesterday
TF2 last night was good fun. 'Till Wrek went idle and the server shut down. :P
FINALLY.
Jim- I'm planning to do Fluttershy and Applebloom
00,10I suddnly want to see wreks take on the mane6 in tf2 loadouts.
I prefer "fan of My Little Pony"
o.o
?
Brony is easier to say than that.
^
Im a brony or a pegasister im not bothered wich
TF2 is so much fun to play with other bronies
Brony is so much better
tovler too long
wants this picture
i dnt really care what i am called i just like MLP
i love minecraft with fellow bronies
-has never played tf2 in my life- some of my friends was saying it was crap =/
You need better friends.
xD
:D
Coolbluemidnite: It's quite cool if you play it with cool people
anything is good if you put ponies in it
:d
thanks Wrek :)
00,10I was not much of a fan of tf2 unless I was playing with friends.
I never played TF2 but I heard it was a lot of fun
TF2 is really only a PC thing so console players dont really get it
00,10I have a blast playing with all of you.
i guess im scaredd of going on it cus people will look at me like >.> wth when i have no idea what im doing
Hey guys Im back! Shame you can't play tf2 on ur phone
We wub you Sumica /)^3^(\
00,10especaly that melee map
When Wrek is done drawing he should start the server up.
No doubt, TF2 on a console is a strange paradox of itself.
Degroot
i just got itt yesterday but wrek brought the server down b4 it loaded :(
xD
aww
00,10oh that reminds me. must reinstall steam
Bronystate TF2 night on Degroot.

00,10man that guys has too many titles in his name.
dun dun DUUUN
“In general the media has not been kind to bronies, especially Fox News,” Redden said. “One of the Fox people even mentioned drug use, which has absolutely nothing to do with any part of the culture. We know the media wants a character, but we get frustrated because that’s not an accurate representation.”
Furher lolwut.
What kinda name for a king is Bradley.
for brony studie :D
Fuhrer President King Bradley
Meanwhile: no, his NAME is King Bradley
and then Kenshiro came and killed everybody with his fist of the north star.
the end.
He reminds me of somebody...
King beind actual name or title?
What kinda name for a king is King Bradley?
Yeah, he's not a King.
Like, One Piece Pirate or something
"King" is part of his name, not title.
Fuhrer President King ._.
Generalisim in the french version ... simply
Meanwhile: he's the Fuhrer of the country
Ok.
lol
Furer president?
what is this.. I don't even
no lungs..... has to cough
What kinda name for a Fuhrer is King Bradley?
He's king of the pirates. Don't you see his eyepatch, silly fillies?
people will always hate us because we dont conform with society Paradise92
Also, does he have the same VA as the Third Hokage from Naruto?
Fuhrer is actually good but Hitler used it soo...yeah
Maybe Cowboy Bebop pirate...
yeah
He made Fuhrer bad
Ultra super ewtra whatever you said ... bradley xD
im back
CriticKitten: Silly Kitty, Luffy is King of the Pirates!
eh, it doesn't bother me too much
Cowboy Bebop & One Piece crossover: Big Victory or Epic Fail?
unicorn?
Critchley: you saying each of his titles refers to him being leader of a different group?
00,10Fuhrer is his military rank, presedent is his office King is his name.
September: sadly Epic Fail
Unicron
wait
THanks for setting it all straight, Sumica.
/me is back
best transformer
when did Fuhrer become a Military Rank?
RAWRity: nope.avi, clearly Bradley earned the title first
welcome back Kipkat07.
dun dun DUUUN
That's right. Name her Sebastian!
CriticKitten: but he's yet to find One Piece!
Is this full metal alchemist?
also, he should totally call himself Super Kami Guru Fuhrer King Bradley
00,10yeah it is.
FMA brotherhoods
lol RAWRity
No this is the Krusty Krab.
nice, never watched it
RAWRity: So far as you know!
00,10super god wizeman
He's already got one. It's very nice.
*Super Kami Guru Fuhrer President King Bradley
Now go away or he shall taunt you a second time.
im starting to think bronystate needs a 'Now showing' sign or something
Sumica: Super God Wizeman, why does that sound familiar?
00,10no clue
Can add as many titles as you want, his name is still Bradley.
dun dun dun
dat one thing
00,10stabbie stabbie
Dead babbeh.
Poke.
Whaa!
Facebook poke
lol
and then Al was hauling around a corpse.
get stabbed through the gut. "Can I help you sir?"
Lol
WHY DOES HE KEEP DOING THAT?!
If he tripped, would he snap her like a twig?
lol
otakon: doing what?
Ooii.
haha
RAWRity: stabbing Al in the body
00,10suddnly armstrong
Cause it's fun.
The way he runs, I'm amazed she isn't mush in his leg aleady.
ofc SUDDENLY ARMSTONG!
OH GOD ARMSTRONG.
...is it tiny miniskirt time, Sumica?
ALEX LUIS ARMSTRONG *sparkle* *sparkle*
otakon: I imagine it's akin to beating on a pinata.
OHAI Armstrong!
Seriously, if I had a robot, I would stab him all day. Who wouldn't?
Paradise92: INDEED!!!!*sparkle, sparkle*
Oh miss, you can salute me all day if you want
00,10lol wut LadyCanary
Armstrong has proven he's a boss one too many times, can we just retire him to a private island or something? :c
lol
LadyCanary: hmm?
Dem miniskirts
Oh wait im thinking of Mustang.
If he is sparkles who is moonbeam?
otakon like you say "The only man allowed to sparkle"
It's always time for a tiny miniskirt.
indeed!!!!!!
woot
That feel you get when you watch an anime and it makes you want to play a RPG
That one line he has: ALL FEMALE OFFICERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO WEAR TINY MINISKIRTS
lol
00,10I was like wait did wrek draw somthing again.
That is best line in the show
Dashie_Dashie|Lolwut: indeed
Winry's here. NOW it's tiny miniskirt time.
Now I miss Hughes. :'c
RAWRity: no, tiny top time
I really like her... mane?
00,10it's the phone he died in.
Greed!
yes flutter_spin :p
Cheese and Rice, when are the-- OHNO GREED.
:);):)
Hello Greed!
/me remembers her original outfit of overalls and a black strip of cloth around her chest....
Winry Rockbell: She wears skirts as belts and belts as shirts.
/me giggles.
Suddenly TrollGreed appears!
Ohai RAWRity
emangamer: ohai? I been her like an hour.
is the little girl still in there?
dem Smile remixes
RAWRity: Well at least she's not wearing belts as a dress, like Lulu from FFX
*here
Greedo dah.
he's Greedo?
00,10greedoda
RAWRity: well I've zoned in and out
does that mean he'd shoot first?
the ponybeat mix is pretty good
wait, ponybeat is in there?
as in Odyssey Eurobeat?
yes
it's Marcoh!
he released a new song earlier today
Paradise92: eeyup
instrumental but nice background music
Hi MirrorImage! Didnt see you there!
CriticKitten: no now, Lulu had a dress that covered most of her body. It's just that her breasts were so enormous that clothing just could not contain them.
00,10cyborg Paradise92
I personally like Love Me Cheerilee and Discord by LivingTombstone & EuroBeat
Sumica Terminator Lary?
RAWRity: oh yh, I remember that
Paradise92: sort of, sometimes (seemingly rarely) is about and speaks
guy in the sewer tell you he is a doctor
:D
seems legit
and then Marcoh lost it
http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2010/6/14/129210157191556358.jpg
Random guy in the sewer says he's a doctor. Smeems Legit.
dat cat
TheGreatAndPowerfulT I think he lost it forever ago.
Really, if anybody had the most shameless outfit, it was Riku in FFX-2
September want me to PM you a dirtie version of Love me Cherrile?
Its friday!
Paradise92 Sure why not.
September: yep
dat link is awesome
RAWRity: but Rikku is HOT.
FRIDAY NIGHT
nothing wrong with the floor :P
ffx-2 was pretty poor in comparison to ffx
so what's it say?
otakon: and 15.
Theo friday morning :p
unfoundbug: agreed
....Rikku is underage, dude!
And then otakon was a perv.
hang on...
wtf
that smile remix
otakon: ...wow
Don't use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue!
those songs
should never be mixed
I google that guy and I get images 40% Hitler and 40% Obama. Why google?
though really, if anybody's a perve, it's the game makers who had Rikky wearing a miniskirt, bikini top, and visible thong. AT FIFTEEN.
*pervert
but its... pretty good
*rikku
what anim is this?
dat face
1AM X_x i have to go to bed, sorry luna, bye everypony :)
Bye Saigneur
for me its 6:04 pm
yeahx3 is so much better with pinkie singing
Night Saigneur
RAWRity: That's standard FF faire, though
Shadowpony0071: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
Bye Saigneur, may you dream of ponies!
6_9
bye Saigneur
oh
i hope so =D
00,10This is Full metal alchemist: Brotherhood.
bye to ya
00,10manly tears
armstrong is best manly man
Armstrong crying?!
CriticKitten: at lest they usually try to cover a LITTLE more than that. Plus that scene in x-2 where she compares breast sizes with Yuna....
Lies.
D: Awww.
Man tears!
What's wrong with his hair?
Shadowpony0071 6PM <3 lucker ^^
that is some intense emotions going on there
X-2 can go burn
indeed
Sumica...i found a fanfic...involving FMA and MLP :)
Armstrong is stronger now, he will NEVER forget
x-2 has one thing going for it: It doesn't have fucking Tidus
FFX was at least salvageable if you removed about half its character roster. I actually enjoyed it, sort of.
also, brb guys
Armstrong pony where is it ?
Meanwhile his hair reminds me of some comic, though I can't remember the name
RAWRity: I acutally like Tidus as a character, gameplay and story wise tbh
good o' Lust
brb
MLA
otakon: you got issues then.
repeat post????
Tidus can eat ALL the ass.
/me giggles.
...ok then.
FFX was my first Final Fantasy. I will not deny its faults, but I did like Yuna... as a character *cough*
night all.
NEEDS MORE PONIES<
00,10she cut it off and tied it to a dog to loose the guy that was chaceing her.
September: She cut it off to get away from the Homonculi that was chasing her.
Final Fantasy 7 > all.
You know what I#m talking about.
There is over 100 Final Fantasies in the future.
Firefox craches for the 6th time today?

Binned.
00,10I need to make that an image with that face of his RAWRity
He just DECIDES to keep drinking.
CriticKitten: he sure as hell doesn't want to.
....would you want to?
:P
because he can drink it~
Is it wrong I thought of Rawrity's comment in RageComic form?
Ugguh.
O.o
Useless peasants
23 Hours until I piss away a few hours of my life derpin around on BronyState. :D
How long does a brony need to be a brony till he is considered by the brony community as a full true brony?
http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
Watched every episode at least once.
When he/she is able to recite the entire theme by heart/
Oh and had 1 dream about ponies
You will never get a decents night sleep. BITCH.
okay then im a brony
I used to wonder what friendship could be~
When he or she can sing Art of the Dress without missing a beat.
I piss away hours on bronystate everyday.
as soon as you are in the state of liking the series, you are a brony
/me is punched in face by Bronystatee
I'mokwiththis
NOPE.
Keep that gun ed! you'll need it!
05really enjoyign this show
SuperBrony64: wub...

It's dangerous to go alone. Take this gun!

10,02emangamer: Dat wub...
Wrek: glad to hear! It's got some issues, but overall it's a very good show.
?*

/me obtained a scout!

I bet panda's taste awesome.
05i was told by almost everyone that the brotherhood part of it was useless
has this stream ever done a mlp from start to the newest episode?
I say you do 1) Proudly say you are a brony 2) Visit EQD 3) Visit Bronystate
/me wonders if SB has ping for wub.
When are Ed and Winry gonna stop beating around the bush and make out already.
05but i cant see anythign wrong, entertainment is entertainment
10,02Dat wub ping
The issues are pretty minor, though, honestly. This is probably one of the better anime out there by a good margin.
Wreky!
2_2 first time ive watched this anime
Oh my gosh, how much strength love can bring me. PART OF THE BRONY MOTTO
I dont have enough room on the side of my computer that faces me to put my rarispike sticker from welovefine :(
10,02Actually I don't .___.

Inb4 not for long SB.
SuperBrony64
10,02Cause sometimes the wub isn't actually for me ;____;

Wrek: Really? Wow, that's surprising. Brotherhood's the BEST part of FMA honestly.
xD

I agree with Dashie_Dashie! Alch pony!
/me Glomps Meanwhile
lol if only 2 people could stream at once.... i think im too tired to pay attention to drawing :/ Sorry Wrek :p
....in fact most of the cast of FMA:B has ranks in badassery
/me is glomped by a low flying PinkiePieCopy.
Draw Team Bronystate Wrek~!
It's like a requirement
I didn't ask for this...
00,10I would love to see you draw tf2 ponies.
10,02Sumica: Dat 64 ping
"You must be at least this badass to be on this show"
Glomp means a hug tight asheck
05anyways back to fma, back in the outro/intro
Wrek already did, Pony Fortress
This coming from the guy who shot flames out of his hands at a woman...
Some needs to teach me how to be good at TF2
He enforces Kill It With Fire
00,10I meent mane6 and co
Dat coughing of blood
I can teah you RaveBrony
:o
oh look
Are we able to go into a private game so you can show me?
The key to TF2 is knowing how your class is best used to support the team.
I just get killed by turrets....in practice...
I wonder how old these guys are
Riza b4 she took her level in badass
Meanwhile: or spy
No, the key to TF2 is spending 1 year away from it and come back to find you killing everybody
Indeed.
Like I did
00,10botmatches are a good way to learn the ropes then refine with layers
Meanwhile, also being willing to change to whatever class is needed at the time
PinkiePieCopy: like riding a bike.
Awww, why no english voices?
Yup.
Also, hi
and don't go all alone after all it is Team Fortress
oh wait! Pride's gonna show up soon, awesome!
The same reason why we don't listen to MLP in other languages
When my kd spread is like 0:28....28 being death...bots dont help :'(
00,10I left tf2 for over a year and came back to all my stuff being called vintage.
News flash: english>japanese
WRONG.
well, that was a bad movie.
Sumica: same thing
/me hits CupcakeWarrior with a cinderblock.
well more like six months~
I left TF2 for a year to find all my opponents exploded or on fire
Whats so bad about dubs?
Nein Deutsch ist besser!
Sumica, and yet still plenty useful to kill everyone
How ong has TF2 been around?? O.O
*long
Actually I've never heard this dubbed. But in my experience dubs of anything suck.
00,10indeed
LOL
2007 right ?
i think
RaveBrony: like, 5 years.
i don't remember
Death Note had a pretty good dub.
Meanwhile: then you must not have many experiences with modern dubs.
Woah!!! THen im SUPER late to the party O_o
im always so supprised at how much they keep adding yet it never feels too unbalanced
Theoboldi the german dub is horrible
00,10I rather like my "direct hit" rocket launcher.
:D
RAWRity: When you find something to suck you generally don't check up on thigns like it at a later date.
iv run on that since i got it a couple years back
Who is the best person to use in TF2??
BTW someone have a strange medigun ?
Which is why I don't care about Final Fantasy or console gaming.
I watched the english one. I think I'll take a quick look at teh german one later.
Meanwhile: you mean like with Ponies?
And now you learn how awful this war really was. >_>
I wont even watch an anime if it doesnt have a dub
08,01i hate this essay
08,01it can go make cheese.
RaveBrony: depends on what you like and how you play~
RaveBrony there isnt ont
RAWRity: My only prior experience with ponies was Rescue from Midnight Castle.
one*
every class has strengths and weaknesses
Well ive played 3 characters and i suck at all of them...
What episode is this?
RaveBrony, practice
RaveBrony: find your niche.
start with engie or pyro
and changing to what is needed generally helps
Start with engi? Pfft.
you will learn to aim
we are the cutie mark crusader!
pyro is a good call
Engie? Starting? Are you kidding me?
Pyro is too close range.
Start with the Pyro.
00,10piro is a blast on payload especaly with the back burrner ^_^
Start with soldier.
run at enemy, burn enemy, kill enemy
Skinny guy? dies in one hit.... Rocket launcher guy? gets burned to death.. Healer? Cant do sheeeyut :'(
Well, I give Breaking Dawn a 1/10. Its manner offends.
I have the back burner, and on payload I won
ugh the back burner
i did star with engie just because, the sentry distracted everyone while i shoot them
lol I can't focus with Ed's face. "What the hell?!" look on his face/
*yawns* Time for me to finish my homework. Goodnight everypony.
Soldier at least has ranged potential.
cheap ass weapon
Tovler: a 1 is too high
rave, all of them are necessary
