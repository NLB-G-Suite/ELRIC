0,14also, Ingwaz, yep, GGAC+ is getting a PS3/360 port
11,01Sorry I won't be joining you.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdEJGrDvAoA&feature=related And my toubles seemed to far away. .. but now they are here to stay. I believe, in yesterday. . .
hey saxyinformer could you please fill me in on how to refrence someones name so they get a ding noise? :D
TheDr... wat
11,01You know my opinion of EA.
SolarColt: just type their nick
interesting, i was not aware, will it be an actual on disc game or xbla?
thats what i said
Nittany_Discord: yh, but BIOWARE made this, at least TRY THE DEMO!
oh man thanks otakon i feel smart ._.
11,01But EA published it.
0,14sure, SolarColt, you just type in their name. If you start to type their name, and press tab, it'll autocomplete
hmm...what to do...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KpES1G_5jg&feature=related
11,01And EA is very anti-consumer.
SolarColt: no worries, I still don't know everything on to do with IRC myself
Nittany_Discord: i dont like EA either, but they dont actually make the games... Bioware does, EA just gets money for it cause they bought them...
Nittany_Discord: agreed on that one tbh
Colt_of_Personality: party? lol
11,01EA ruins the games.
oh thankyou as well SaxyPretender! seems to be working
0,14I think, XBLA, Ingwaz
Midnight_Tempest: he doesn't want to support a publisher like EA
Maybe...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4SmKXh78cI Alright. Last bit of sad music for now.
otakon: I dont either but if you dont buy the game then your not supporting Bioware or any other actual developers of the games...
Is a stream back up or is it still down?
eeyup
11,01If you buy EA-published games, you're keeping a business that only cares about investors alive. They'd rather screw you over.
still down
k
:'(((((((((((
y
y there no stream yet?
Dead Island and UP sad music combined
Y?!?!?!?!?
what UP?
11,01Well, sorry for Bioware.
MahBoi777: are you TRYING to kill everyone here?
im new here and i wanted to know when they play MLP episodes?:)
KetaminaDianePie: you seem sad, just a guess though
0,14also, there's going to be a revamped version of GGAC+ over in japanese arcades, that make Justice and Kliff not broken/banned
Nittany_Discord: I know that, but if EA goes down then every company they bought goes with them
11,01Oh well.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTAxtapb5JI&feature=related Ha ha, time for tears!
pinkiepie is the iron chancelor

KetaminaDianePie: have you updated FF?
and this surrogate of a chat doesnt scrolll......
SaxyPretender: he kicks ass
OOH!
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
11,01I know developers are more in-touch with gamers than publishers are, but publishers are ruining the industry and made me hate mainstream gaming, so I won't support them.
SaxyPretender: I want to show you something?
Imean I do, hold on
0,14shoot, otakon
11,01If Bioware wants my money, I'll pay them directly for a copy.

SaxyPretender: this one comment: Sephiroth: Mine has Length.Cloud: Mine has Thickness.Kliff: And unlike you two, mine﻿ does not compensate for anything
11,01More Discord? Want!
Colt_of_Personality: i doubt it
awww
Pink Celestia toys will be what bronies use to punish their children.
0,14well, SolarColt, that's probably Hasbro thinking, "Hey, girls like pink, right? Let's make her pink!"
i would love to see more discord though :D
LOL

Discord yes!

Lol.. this is the best response to a bronyhater I've ever typed up.
0,14MahBoi777, one day, GabeofThrones and I will duel in Soul Calibur V
Define "Lame" and reading a fanfic doesn't make you a sissy, unlike you I'm not an emotionless human being that doesn't mind reading something that could move someone's heart, Also that's unfair to people whom﻿ are "Gay", calling someone gay makes you feel tough doesn't it? better yet, it could be your own thoughts about your sexuality... beats me, I know I'm a heterosexual 19 year old male who happens to like ponies... Dealwithit.avi

good morning everypony
Hello there VioletGreySha
otakon: yeah, Bridget creeps me out like that too... but is a really fun character to use
but why no Kliff?
WHY WASN'T HE IN XX?
mornin VioletGreySha
tis a SHAM!
hiya VioletGreySha and morning
I'm still unconvinced by /mlp/
he was otakon... he was a special character you had to unlock
Midnight_Tempest: I did not know that, too bad I SUCK at fighters
Polydunami: me too, STILL say it's a trap
I am more of a classical guy
http://www.youtube.com/user/makkon06?ob=0&feature=results_main#p/u/7/vHApVIdbEyo
it wasnt hard to unlock him...
I've never played much Guilty Gear, but I love the fact that heavy metal/hard rock music is involved with the characters and some moves ^_^
I'm confused as to why anyone would WANT to go to 4chan.
Dead or alive is best fighter game
Midnight_Tempest: did you not hear me? I SUCK AT FIGHTING GAMES
Messing with trolls, i guess
no matter how much I practice I suck
My sister's boyfriend does that
Just keeptrying
Practice makes perfect?
I don't own any atm
spawny
Placebo: no
u still there?
haha.
hm?
it doesn't matter
I'm more of a Halo guy, anyway.
kinda
kinda, lol
doin homework
Halo FTW
Placebo: don't even get me started on that crap
no, no hw for u
and keepin this up on second screen
I hate Halo for the most part
no
nad halo

Beats the hell out of CoD.

Halo is an okay game for me
But whatever floats your boat.
but... it
battle field
its due in 10 hours though
/me yawns
/me makes coffee
wb steamdrive
Placebo: not really, in Halo it always devolved into "RUN headlong into the enemy then melee them" or "Get killed by one hit weapons people IMMEDIATELY go for "
makin bacon
lol
I don't really go for mainstream stuff
Usually
I wish I had bacon
jeez it's freakin late here
now on the other had
Mass Effect 3's Multiplayer is pretty fun
Okay.. so if marshmellows are made out of hooves what does that make pinkie pie?
but the controls are a little finicky
steamdrive: Pinkie Pie
otakon: That's somewhat the case in some game types, but it boils down to DMR/BR battles for the most part.
so I was at the store, talking to a friend about poniez and some guy said poniez suck, and i was like " http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1008/ "
she eats hooves(in a sense of thought)
Placebo: yh, and don't even get me started on those no scope bastards
you know
lol Spawn
otakon: You wouldn't like me, then.
LOL
Gelatin CAN be made WITHOUT horse bones
otakon, I know dat feel
marshmellow on cotten candy that would be a frekin mess
It's my favorite role.
Placebo: bmfw I'm playing one it ME3's MP
Tarku: that guy is so hilarious-looking, he's awesome
otakon: :D

lakingsfan: o.O that would be delicious.... maybe
Polydunami: :D
otakon: you totally have to show me the ropes tomorrow in ME3..

Polydunami: ikr?

PONIEZ WHERE? ;D

Umm... didn't intend for there to be a pun
@Tarku
I love u
@solar
Hold on
okay thankyou :)
Midnight_Tempest: DO IT, no really make a damn appointment. What's wrong with your eye could be something VERY serious. You want to lose your sight over a you not trusting Drs. bc of the past? MOVE ON! They aren't ALL idiots, and if something can be done about THEY WILL DO IT!!!!
Suddenly, wall.
/me hugs steamdrive *wub*

LOL
You pony's have no idea how far
and thankyou as well steamdrive :)
/me /)^3^(\
*I have scoured the internet for this kind of music
otakon: i've never had a needed to go to a doctor for anything less than an operation... >_< if i lose my sight... then it was going to happen anyway... yeah...
Your welcom Solar
Dang, Rarity was once my LEAST favourite out of the Mane six
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0sW8KrZF5s&feature=iv&src_vid=qqo53-pNxsE&annotation_id=annotation_372644
/me 's body isn't quite ready for the Smile song that will be coming out Saturday.
This is atill my favorite song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHApVIdbEyo&feature=channel_video_title
Midnight_Tempest: no, not if they say "If you would have come to us earlier we would have been able to save it"
Polydunami: I love them all but out of the six i'd say fluttershy is my favorite :D
Rainbow dash and twi are my fav
what about least favorite?
Rarity's character really hasn't impressed me.
Dash and AJ favs for me
SolarColt: Actually, it's more of a tie between Rarity and Fluttershy for me
I like how apple and dashy are voiced by same person
And Pinkie Pie
steamdrive: FS and PP are as well.
indeed
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_o9kvmKtClZg/TUK_5w-AWKI/AAAAAAAAADA/rcIsChGemsc/s1600/Everywhere2.jpg
with least or favorite Polydunami ?
Derpy and Luna same actress
really?
I can't really say I have any kind of least favoutire
Lol, ya
*favourite
name of voice actor? xD
Spawn, who else is same as luna and derpy?
otakon: i just dont wanna go to the doctor... im more worried that its something REALLY bad and that would just crush my mom... >_< she already lost her brother to something the doctors couldn't identify...
uummm... sec
Google.
lol.
I guess if I was prodded hard enough, I'd choose Rainbow Dash
Big mac is best pony.
haha whys that?
But that's really pushing it
I don't hate her at all
I love doctors. They never lie to you.
well, lets put it this way
Luna, Derpy, Rarity, Nightmare moon, Zecora, Granny Smity
WHOA
which pony out of equestria do you dislike the most
Rarity
Nightmare moon? =s
apparently
lol :D
Prince Blueblood's a dick.
ditto
yeah agreed
Thought one fanfic makes him in like, my top 10..
Midnight_Tempest: would you rather have it be something that cripples you and COULD have been prevented? Don't you think seeing her son permanently damaged would be WORSE at this point bc your doing it to 'protect' her? SHES YOUR MOTHER, she cares about your wellbeing and you are here and kicking.
though*
but trixie is also a bit of a bitch
OMG, wallz, otakon
Placebo: same here
if Gilda was a pony, I'd say Gilda
Zecora is same as Derpy? that is crazy
sorry, trying to drive a point in witha sledgehammer
PM's, bro.
Trixie is fav non mane
10,02Ohai :3
MahBoi777: haha same here
Dat restart @.@
hi SB
hai
But canon-wise, I still say Blueblood
why steamdrive o__o
yeah. kina weird all the minor characters are the same VA
Or Diamond Tiara
Can't stand her
Now that I think of it..
:D
SuperBrony64:, who's your favorite pony?
i never realized how many assholes there are in equestria until now lol...
Not ALL the time, at least
10,02Everypony ^_^
otakon: yeah... yeah... but im stubborn... i dont like doing things when im told to do them >_< i need time to do them on my own... better late then never, right?
Dat vague answer..
10,02But if you must know...
yess?
10,02Derpy and Fluttershy ^_^
YESS
/me falls out of chair
Yep
good job
Midnight_Tempest: fine will you think about it then? and not better late than never, that's no good.
:|
I already knew about Fluttershy
10,02What?
?
derpy i'd have to say is my 4th fav
How did I NOT see Derpy as SB's favorite..
Midnight_Tempest: when it comes to your health, better late than never is death man.
10,02:3
SilverScreen has a good favourite pony ;)
10,02derpy is a silly filly :3
that is acceptable :P :(
SuperBrony64: excellent choices
10,02Thanks ^_^
First time I watched an episode was when I was playing "amnesia: the dark descent". I was wanting to see what had the internet hyped up.. My friend walked in all like wtf is this crap? we watched half of season one together the next day
how is derpy not awesome?
/me needs to pick a favorite pony...
Gilda is best pony.
Actually, I have to be honest: Rarity was my least favourite out of the Mane Six
Problem, bronies?
steamdrive: wow hahaha
10,02Who is ready for a stream?
NO:[
/me this guy.
10,02:<
YES
But as I got more into the show, Rarity kind of grew on me

And I am where I'm at today
yay 64 X
awww yeaah :D
otakon: it'll be fine... i need time thats all, and a job... a job would make it easier for me to consider going to a doctor
steamdrive: secretly i think my friends a brony -__-

Also, it's all yours SuperBrony64

of course RD is the target of this song, lol
Otakon, u know she wants AJ
MahBoi777: bc bronies are weird
I came for the plot. then stayed for the 'plot'
:P
dat plot
steamdrive: it's the FANDOM that wants HER to want AJ
^
RD x Big mac, on the other hand..
And this is the part of the fandom I don't adhere to :|
^__^
No, no no..
i dont want a lesbo RD D:

Oh Otakon, we all know it is Cannon

Yeah
Ship ALL the ponies.
/me suddenly is wearing a Kilt
o.o
steamdrive: it's not canon until we see her, well you know

midnight, NOoo~!
Dken2021: bascialy putting characters from the show in romantic relationships. doesn't have to be same sex but since 85% of the cast are female it just happens that way.
10,02That is so weird
ahhh this axts like rickroll
10,02Why does it play that first video over and over again?
:D
Because your a silly filly.
SuperBrony64|PIE: that's what I've been wondering
And you're doing it wrong.
otakon: have you read On a Cross and Arrow?
the playlist knows who the best pony is
it's like a rickroll
10,02Fixed :3
Polydunami: um no
YES!
Epic pie time. xD
I love this bit
Calle dit.
Oh goodness

This video
I love this so much
I know that part, I don't understand why alot of people love to do that
Dken2021: i don't know tbh either
e rainbow apples disappeared
but whatever
Also, On a Cross and Arrow is a rule 63 fic
Surprisingly good
only 63 fic I've read had an AU setting.. Not bad.
Cross and Arrow is one of my favs.
Same here
And the sequel is out now

Well, the first chapter
Polydunami: wait, isn't it the one where the stallion manesix meet the manesix?
/me wants some JD now...
Yeah
ORLY?
either somebody is using my username or it was my internet dropping and odd server things
damn big pie
And they go to an AU
is the stream still up or is mine just acting up?
AU?
steam: odd things
Polydunami: Is it the one where 3 of the mane 6 fall in love with themselves?
hay bacon strips, lol
Alternate Universe

Let's see... yeah, at the end, half of the mane six falls with her own male self
Yeah, that'st he one I've read.

SolarColt: no
Ponies make it tolerable.
/me dials a certain number

SolarColt: hmm, maybe
This does good for trixie
brb, the people hating that song made me need to flip a table.
Just poking fun
Like I normally do
SolarColt: but I'm pretty sure the PMV only featured bits from the show
yeah i know
im just saying
I suppose this is based on... hmm... Moonlight Sonata? I dunno
yfw you realize Trixie's eyebrows make the ಠ_ಠ face
its what it reminded me of
Dang it, Placebo :D
Placebo, u are a bad person
wub wub
Sad trixie is sad
Now i'm sad ;.;
ಥ_ಥ
Dang it makkon06 :'(

Nice picture, but her hairline in the front is way off, imo..
trixie? feel bad? does not compute!
she looks like bald old man in mirror image :D
Oh god
LOL
Well, she doesn't really look old to me
Hmm...
I don't think she looks old.. her hairline is just way to far back.
i dont know why i thre that word in there
Silver Spoon looks like an old lady with her color scheme.
One word: pony
its just i associate bald with old

lol, crash
mines to earn my cutie

@RAINBOWCRASH That's cool! I dream that Discord will comback for another episode.
I've have some of the wierdest dreams...
Chaospony_837: making pineapples come to life and dance and kill hordes of zombie trees
It's been bothering me I swear...
/me dreams of voicing a character on FiM
Not really
I don't believe in myself.
:(
DONT STOP
BELIEVIN
brb
cant connect to server >_<
ok
thankyou MahBoi777 xD
no problem:D
SuperBrony64: you probably ruined the server by putting shit loads of TNT and trigger it
it's one oclock and i'm getting tired but this is to damn awesome
and now
@Polydunami, that sounds really awesome! I also dream about voice acting with John de Lancie as Discord's apprentice.
your at the edge of the world....?
thanks to you, I can't login to the server anymore
I want to be a famous Brony..it just takes time. And patience...and skill.
lol Simon, me either
Lol
that can't be Simon, TNT solves all problems
@SolarColt, your's is...chaotically awesome! Be my chaos partner?
MahBoi777: WRONG
of course Chaospony_837 :D
10,02Simon: Just rejoin it
we cant
I haven't really dreamt it
/me sighs and lays head down
SB show that house of yours
LOL!!! XD
SuperBrony64: I think you're too playful
10,02I'm trying to find it O___O
TOY_PON32: don't worry, be happy
Just thought, "Hey, why not walk down the street to Oceans Studios and request a part?"
10,02What's wrong with being playful? ;A;
THIS
:D
you put shit loads of tnt and triggered it
everything maybe causes people harm
I can't..I need to fulfill my dream.
and now, server ruined
TNT ALL THE THINGS
10,02We put WAAAAAAAAAY more TNT before on that mountain and it survived
Anypony heard about Project Saturation? I'm considering to voice act for the part of Fluttershy. Or mayb even a minor part if they get one.
I think, out of everyone here, I live closest to Ocean Studios
besides tnt always solves your problems on single player worlds that is
10,02See, it's fine
hooray, im in
whats saturation if you dont mind explaining?
Or at least second or third closest
10,02You need to relax Simon ^_^
Chaospony_837: YES, I can't wait till they finish it!
It's not really bragging for me
SuperBrony64: not that I'm not relaxed, it's just that I think you're too playful
/me looks at his homework and gives an emotionless look
uh oh the vikings were right the world is flat
And atm
I still can't get into the server
Server's not ruined, just having problems holding a connection
SolarColt: it's a fanmade animation project, hang on, I got a link
which server are you on?
Chemistry isnt going to help me become well known..
PartyCannon: not really
hooray for tnt!
Satuartion is when you make things more colorful. You know how Discord made the Mane Six all grey and took away their elements? Well in the story he actually takes them to an extreme so that they're their elements in a bad way.
:[
I never have this problem on that server
:[
even with high ping
sounds interesting i'll have to look into it
Oh, and I don't mind you asking at all SolarColt.
SuperBrony64: since you've been putting too much TNT, I blame you
^
well thankyou you're very kind Chaospony_837
^__^
/me is deciding to fulfill dream or give up
I'm out..
all the servers down :D
:S*
TOY_PON32: just do something ^__^
10,02Well, it will be back up again soon
SolarColt: http://youtu.be/TeXNcctNZWk
thanks :)
no prob
do some more videos while you wait then
SuperBrony64: nope
Polydunami: It's not that simple I want to make what you call an 'impact'
Aww...thanks Solar. Will you be on the server tomorrow waiting for the live feed? I'd like to chat with you again soon. you seem nice.
Okay
It's impossible for somepony like me..
If you want to make an impact, go right ahead
Have I ever told you guys just how much I don't like my school?
TOY_PON32: you put yourself down way too hard
ping me when something happens
Chaospony_837: which role were you planning to try out for?
@SolarColt, just in case you didn't catch my post, will you be on the server tomorrow waiting for the live feed? I'd like to chat with you again soon. you seem nice.
Polydunami: That's how I feel bro. I'm pretty depressed as of right now.
sure will, i'm actually fairly new but i'll drop by again and thankyou you seem nice as well Chaospony_837
4chan MLP board?
What?
moot, what are you doing?
@MahBoi777, hopefully Fluttershy. But I'm not an expert in voicing her so I'm hoping that I can audition for a side role.
Today's failure will lead to tomorrow's success
lol streamception
so i herd you like streams
I don't have any programs to draw, or make music, or even videos. I have nothing...not even confidence..
/me drinks
SB64, still no :-P
10,02That's weird, the server is still down O___O
TOY_PON32: what do you like to do?
ugh... Now I'm pissed off at SuperBrony64's TNT spam
TOY_PON32: Well, get them!
10,02Sorry, didn't mean to crash the server :/
SuperBrony64: too playful...
@SolarColt, well thank you sir gentlecolt. I'm actually fairly new to Bronystate too. But I need to go to bed, so I'll catch you later!
it is 1:00 not that that has to do anything with it
off to bed.. later guys! it was nice being here see you all tomorrow :)
I'm broke no money for fancy shmancy programs..
So am I.
Didn't stop me.
Chaospony_837: good luck a getting the part!
/me drinks more
10,02Think I got it...

I swear, I had SUCH a hard time watching the original Reacts video.
Oh, and check out Discorded Ponies on YouTube if you get bored. It's awesome!
TOY_PON32: School is such a party pooper.
/me is graduated from highschool

SB64, its back up!
@MahBoi777 Night! See you tomorrow for the live feed?
Just one more god damn year...
I, too, suffer from bouts of low confidence
I just realised that I was talking as if you ponies could hear the "Teens React" video in the background.
/me drinks more
Chaospony_837: I'm afraid I won't be able to make it, hope yall have fun!:)
I still can't reach the goddamn server

There are things I'm angry about myself
TOY_PON32: if you make a tumblr, I will follow it, lol
I'm still angry about that bloody rejection message I got on facebook :[
your getting trolled big time
I'd be angry about some things about myself, too, but that's one of the problems.
I'm not angry.
MahBoi777: I made one already but it's gone to shit already
I don't get angry most of the time
Restart the server.
But you don't want to see my angry face
I am not kidding
TOY_PON32: oh you have?
I'm stressed that's about it..
I want to see your cooooool faaace.

TIMEOUT
MahBoi777: Yeah..I made promises I couldn't keep
But I'm a bit of a wild card, I suppose. I could never be disloyal to my friends, but I also lie almost at random.
awww, that's okay, have you made an OC yet?
I need to perfect my OC then once I've perfected it then I start.
lol sb64, master of the obvious
Something is seriously wrong with this server.

The plural of surgeon general is surgeons general. The past tense of surgeons general is surgeonsed general.
70 more power point slides to go...
ohai Sumica
00,10Oh hi
hey Sumica
00,10you should see the size of the hole I made doing that
If you dig down far enough in minecraft, can you reach the bottom? or does it go through to an underside?
Minecraft is a flat world
You reach bedrock, eventually.
oh man the internet http://i.imgur.com/8FGHb.png
...so...no empty space underworld? or is bedrock un digable
bedrock is unbreakable
Usually
(unless admin)
Underneath the bedrock, otherwise, is an empty black void
land squid!
Well, always anyway
killitwithfire!
Wtf.
Squid?
Seems legit..
Calamari is delicious!
So is fried wolf.
I still can't believe moot actually made a pony board.
That is fantastic.
Well, for 4channers, that is.
I try not to visit the place.
00,10so this nuke hole has to be like 200 vlocks across and all the way to bedrock.
screenshot?
/me is still unconvinced
dayum
You see, /mlp/ is not listed on 4chan
At least, not as far as I know
You can still go there.
It's even news on EQD.
I know that
soo many uncovered caves? and a lava pool at the bottom?
ths is mah house, mah house is amazing, give it a li-NO
I suppose it's unlisted because of 4trollers
Probably because of the tr-
Yeah.
oh god did i crash the server
nvm, seems like its ok
But really, I can understand that moot would create the board.
Writers block. x
So much traffic.
xD

The ocean is trying to reclaim said crater as well :P
The mayor's not going to be happy.
Stop the water and remove the lava!
You must make a town!
That's one way to terraform.
00,10need to move away from it so it can despaun the blocks
over 9000 Rads detected
Sumica: If you quit and go back in, it should do it perfectly
damn you who ever made that space is 20% cooler clip
Dat Far render distance.
00,10Supprised it could handle all the nukes
my comp cant handle nukes. let a lone TNT

00,10just need the blocks to go away
Lol.
00,10all them are still in the holl

Dat Technic Mod pack
Sumica, you need the nuke mod on the server SB was playing on.
Do it.
00,10looks like the strip miner hit water
bacteria mod is best mod
SuperBrony64: Ya know what would make your treehouse really stand out? Nukes.
i want to hear Fluttershy: YAY
Sumica, is that industrial craft?
I had no idea there was a stream all this time 6_9

More Creatures?

I believe it's actually an expansion on more creatures, but yeah.
Oh, alright.
all those caverns
Well, it's not Twilight Sparkle, so it doesn't matter.
00,10will show you teh aftermath later once the lag clears up
How to clear a dungeon, Sumica style.
Step 1) Light nuke
Step 2) ????
Step 3) Profit.
00,10Dungion bypass
:/
Step 4) Recover your items from your corpse.
00,10oh that reminds me.

ohai Cypresswolf
Hi :)
Sumica: stop hurting scootaloo :(
Sc-....naw, I wont say it this time....
gah.. how long has the stream been up in general?
ohai Mutterguy
couple minutes
and Hi everyone
hi mutter
ok just worried about bandwidth because I forgot to close the bronystate tab
hi RainbowJack
Mutterguy: how long has that tab been open?
sb was streaming earlier
about 6 hrs :(
:(
Mutterguy: ah... well then
Is it bad I put my new Scootaloo & Sweetie Belle custom next to manic Twilight? Im looking over at my pony shelf...and they seem....to all be staring at me
it's one thing having the tab open and watching it but if it's just playing
/me wants to play on this server...
i think its single player
00,10I will see if I can get a server running later on.
never got to try the technic mod because soon as I had the server read.. UPDATE
*ready
00,10it's not full technic, just IC2 and BC
Does minecraft require internet to play?
00,10you can play off line but generaly you have to log in to the servers when you first launch
you have to buy minecraft?
yes RainbowJack
thats to bad
http://www.minecraft.com
i know
Spore ruined net connected games for me. couldnt do anything without logging in first
um,,, aparently thats the wrong domain
http://www.minecraft.net is the right one
/me sighs "i dont really like the game because it costs money for GFX like that"
RainbowJack: those gfx are not as simple to do as you think
i know but it looks a bit cheap in my eyes to even give money for
it looks nice to play but dont want to pay for that
00,10so get a cosmedic pack and make it look nice.
i would really like to play it
So much hate for fluttershy right now -_- and i feel bad saying that
10,02You streaming Sumica/
10,02?
hate for fluttershy?
that's crazy! What did she do?
RainbowJack: you need to pay if you want multiplayer, if you just download it single player works fine
KwakLad: wut?
how
I'm masking her in a clip as im attempting a music video, but i am new (taught myself on wednesday) and im having to mask frame by frame, took me all of yesterday (18 hours) to mask 4 seconds
because she moves her head
but what i have done up to now looks good so im perseveering
00,10nope
wait a minute

10,02^_^*
10,02:P

00,10Oh it's not the new one?
10,02This is the new one...
10,02Rayman Origins
-,-
00,10oh
DRAKE
It sold very well on release i think thats why it went sale quite early?
[18:40:12] <~Artemis> We should have Leo kidnapped and then tortured
[18:40:17] <~Artemis> and have Rhy and Nathan rescue him
[18:40:23] <~Artemis> but Indie doesn't want them to
[19:55:56] <~Artemis> also note to self: Nathan needs to save Rhy sometime while she's trapped
[19:56:19] <~Artemis> note number 2: Rhy needs to do a cliche back-to-opponent, who runs up, and then she kills him in 3 hits
Should I wait for the 3DS version to be released and wait again for its price to go down, or should I just get the wii version, which is already cheap.
if only i love me
woooo
There's going to be a 3ds version? :D
: D
this game looks excelently designed
I'll wait for the demo of the 3DS version and base my decision on that
Yeah.
guys
I have a question
FOR EVERYONE.
Shoot.

The PSV version is almost here
WHAT IS LOVE?
10,02The PS Vita version already came out I think

0,5Its just a snowstorm...

I hate Halloween, I just find it pointless.
^
0,5^
So the kids have learned to stay away from my house now.
The hard way.
Halloween is fun as hell.
It's annoying.
0,5But for some reason God decided it was funny to knock down 1/3 of the country's trees and knock out my internet for a god damn week when it wasnt even winter yet...
ooh, pun intended
You get interrupted every 10 minutes because some kids knock at your door.
10,02>God

The doorway looks scary too...
What game is this?
Or whatever it is.

Rayman Origins
Ooh, haven't seen anything Rayman forever. It scared me when I was a kid.
lol
i loved rayman
Can't say I really played it tbh.
10,02I LOVE PONIEZ
I never got past the level where you ride on the back of a giant mosquito. Not sure which Rayman it was, though.
10,02lol
=0
10,02That was either 1 or this game
Probably one.
know of Rayman but have never played the games.

yyyees
Definately wasn't this one.
:D
Not creepy enough.
oh no
Rofl.
ohai
I've seen creepy boss pictures from this game
XD
Heythere.
I just think it was the art style that scared me or whatever, considering I was like 8.

SB
It reminds me Earthworm Jim, a little bit
Is SB the main streamer?
Not sure.
No, Sumica is

10,02I'm streaming right now

O.po
victory hump
Parasprites
ded

10,02I don't know...
10,02This game is definitely more fast paced
I can see that. o,o
:3
The controls look floaty, if that makes sense
10,02Yup
ah, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. That's what I'm being reminded of.
hiii
Hullo FlutterDash

o joy. more LALALALALALALA
Those things are cool when singing
10,02:3
What happens when the Eletoons turns pink?
That tune will be seared into my brain while I sleep.
10,02Electoons are pink when they are happy I think :>
:3
10,02But it's cool, cause their name is similar to that of Electrons, which also are important to everything in our world ^_^
the world would be more positive without electrons
Wow.
Tovler: o u
10,02O U
I must be tired, cos that made me laugh.
This looks fun. : )
wait. where's my nymph?
I will be hearing that song in my dreams.
well pdnsd is running. should anything happen to the dns servers in anons silly attempt i'm going to be gine
fine'
=It's a nice song. :3
True, but I can feel it eroding my brain.
it needs more bom bom boms
COuld get creepy after a while.
So, are the parasprite things called Electoons? Or was that something else?
Ole
Are they oranges or blades?
Autoscroll? more like autotroll
10,02Orange blades

Has the chat died?
yup
and i'm back. damned real life
ohai everypony
hai Jim
so its me and Jim
There's nobody else here?
would be more active but working atm
well theres 68 here but none responding no
Hmm, well, that's expected at this hour
ohai unfoundbug
thats fair
http://derpy.me/VC9Ya well i'm preped, how bout you?
i got plenty of ponies for 31st march if it happens
Like when Anonymous shut down facebook last november?
oh well, better stock up on ponies before that
so, time to ping the servers you like and write donw the ip address
internet still works fine
this is alot less scary if you know how the internet works
The time travel episode +2 others will be out when the internet shuts down. I'll be ok with it gone.
Its alot les scary if you aren't particularly meithered
Afterall its only supposed to be temporary
A protest, not a killing
The internet will be shut down Saturday. The financial markets will be so inconvenienced.
Tovler|MagicalGirl: Damn good sarcastic point

i see the stream is still off
hi paradise92
Well paradise92 its just gone off not long ago, and hi
ooh rly?
who was streaming?
ohai paradise92
and DJ-P0N-3
SuperBrony64|Zzz was streaming paradise92
hi Phase4 :)
and tnx KwakLad :)
That ping scared me -_-
what anon is atempting to do is take down the 'root nameservers'
which is the thing that allows, for example, 'www.google.com' to be turned into an ip address your browser can use
i doubt they will manage it, alot of work goes into making sure those things dont die
I'll go make myself dinner now, be back later
later Jim
wasn't there a similar attack like that many years ago?
No stream?
the financial sector will go unhindered by the attack
for you Jim it is dinner
but for me it is Lunch!
those things will be IP locked rather than using something like DNS
damnit, the attacks on pony day
unfoundbug: static ip's will have no problems, but every website you use will be
that alone will cause a lot of problems
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server
somepony want to play Stronghold Crusader?
Smile Smile Smile vs Flim Flam Brother Song
Phase, i already started getting the IPs of every site i use
excel will serve as an adequate dns during this issue
i'm just unsure as to how the episode streams will behave
unfoundbug: pdnsd
good morning/afternoon/evening(depending on your region) everypony!
morning HeavyMetalDash
Hello HeavyMetalDash

Generally, just chatting
nvm, seems theres no pdnsd for windows

Johnny quest~?
YES
GOD I LOVED THAT SERIES
saw a new dA alert, so checked that out first. really going now :p
so is wrek wreking or is he gaming?
I'm not completely sure Smile Smile Smile will ever be part of an episode. Much like Oink Oink Oink was moved around in the schedule until it found its place in Baby Cakes, it probably is a song they put away for an appropriate time. With the link, I'm not sure there will be such a time
And I'm not sure why i wrote all that
lol
Nostalgia Critic
I gues I'm just lonely as none of the regulars are regulating the room of the regulars
Knife + Rocket = Knocket?
Reguception.
Ictiv how many people are there?
11
I might get in there
But none of them are actually in the room
/me shrugs
First you wiggel your tail OINK OINK! then wiggel your snout OINK OINK OINK! Wiggel your Rump OINK OINK OINK then SHOUT it out OINK OINK OINK
I've been here back when we communicated through star alignments.
Murrrnapples :3
better than chillin with people I dont know
Also.. Why do I get the feeling that Kammerjunk is streaming while that is impossible?
Old skool.
i love pinkie Pig
Jk been here for like 2 weeks :$
pinkies one man show
It Pinkie Fit
would the mods mind if I posted a link to Wrex's soundtrack on youtube?
/me has been here since we watched Blade Runner
i found it beutiful
/me italic...?
Hey everyone.
Yay :3
hahaha
everypony* Heya Randomnerd :D
i have found this place for like 2 weeks ago
Randomnerd! Someone I recognise! :D
Hi, Rain :)
Hi Pyrexo
i love it here
/me has been here since the week before the start of season 2
Same :D
all of you brony's are so nice
I frequent FunnyJunk, loads of bronies there, so it was natural I would check out the show :P
I've been here from the 2nd night
i found this place due to youtube
MEDIC!!
Pyrexo, have you had a different nick in here?
lol
not Capatalisme?
This is Halloween!
Nope :P EVERYWHERE i am Pyrexo. Steam, youtube, etc
It's never taken ^^
yeah
nick constitutional monachy with an emphasis on a capitalist idea?
I'm still here no sleep yet
but then GHOST would be a Bronie
then you havent been active in here then ^_^
I hate when I forget that I already used a word in a sentance -_-
Here's an idea: Horses are herbivores who live in matriarchies. They aren't agressive, only defensive. Therefore a civilization of theirs is a lot calmer, capitalism works much better with them
Nope not really >.< I've just gotten into the community, Music, Fanfics, Streams
Rain its easy to do with 'then' so dont worry :p
They can also easily stand old style monarchy aswell
GHOST Radio do you guys know trhat?
Nope
He's such a douche
/me just read KwakLad's nick in the absolute worst way
Batman!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mfKg5vs18A&feature=related
Jim i agree
haha go on Rain
>_>?
nick he read my nick-name incorrectly
he?
Rain how did you read my name so bad?
Kawklad?
My mind sits very snugly in a gutter that is how
Lawl
you guys in TF2 do any of you know Ghost Radio?
so does mine rain
Oh i understand this 'kawk' thing now
haha
we are very bad people
RainBowJack: Is it a horror movie? :O
/me looks for her Shizu and her Vivi
no a radio host he is a Capatalist and hates bronies to the core
I really want to know what "Ghost Radio" is now :P
Oh...
go to youtube and shearch for Ghost radio
so, the man test
haha
there is no secret
how GAR is Kamina
no i am ALEX JONES
Ah a brony hater :P And the world keeps spinning...
/me rubs forehead.
he is a Texas
I just realized it's not Saturday
I am also a Texas :D
Oh, Lord, not Alex Jones.
I love spy :D
I don't see how FEMA camps are any more useful for keeping people prisoner than Television.
who would win in a battle of manlyness? Kamina from Gurren Laggan or Alex Armstrong from Full Metal Alchemist?
Armstrong, by Far, Rain.
He's a Gentleman, as well as Masculine.
I wonder, will this week's lottery be today or tomorrow?
If tomorrow, I might not stay up until 4 AM today
Nuuuu~
she will next week
(which is around when BMN ends
false. Neither of them would get in such a petty battle because they have both reached such a level of manlyness that such quarels dont matter
next week is fluttershy ep
and week after is Twilight ep
i like SCOOTALOO
"otakon" is the only guy I remember
ikr? CANT wait
WHAT!!! i like scootaloo
SCOOT IS COOL
McScootaloo
Pyrexo: do you remember Fleur?

I remember Ictiv...Good guy :D
Rain: If you start in Canterlot, will you technically make yourself wet?
Seems like just a few minutes ago s/he was here...
wait what?
That's the reaction I was looking for :D
Translation:
Rain starts in Canterlot >
Fleur gets wet from Rain
now we dont hear TF2 guys anymore
well if I were in another room you would have gotten a different reaction ~.^
alright, just got the email from EQD. My fic has been sent to the pre-readers!

Jim: That didn't help at all :(
/me is technically insain

Rain: If you want, i can point you to a huge piece of burning text on a planet's side that reads "Sorry for the Inconviniece"... I'm the guy selling the post cards just next to the viewing platform, come and we'll talk sometimes :)
LOL

Just a few days ago, my mother asked if we should buy a piano. First I thought I'll say "nag" but then I realized something... If I learn to play the piano, I can perform Cole Porter songs...
nah*
derpy_at_lunch: you wouldnt happen to be 20% would you? Sumica told me about something he is doing
Logical Conclusion: Spock should have played the piano
Anything Goes

Pyrexo: Let me correct you. MLP Goes (my own Brony version :D )
Yes i am from 20pc

I'm going to go put my alien suit on
derpy_at_lunch: done
My connection is perfect

Meh, not so good
Porter is objectively awesome.
I'm better when I actually think on rewrites
What happened to the separate IRCs?
Indeed
Rainbowcrash you're random
Kammerjunk: You know what else?
And with that the mod bronystate project is filled up
I don't, but I have a feeling you'll tell me.
Come with me...
And you'll be...
Hey.

Why is it that people post our faces
We'll begin, with a spin, trav'ling in the world of my creation!
Twilightsparkle: Because we wub woo.
Ictiv: Hah!
What we'll see will defy... Ex-planation?
I'm already listening to pony music!
Wait you're a role player aren't you
Kammerjunk: oh...
Role playing is for fillies
/me brings out the big guns.
VioletVanilla and all other mods: the artist who is drawing the mod picture is "bakki"
Twilightsparkle: Well, you are a silly filly!
Kammerjunk: Ladies and Gentlemen... This is Mambo Number Five!
I'm not a filly
Ictiv: ...
I'm going to go shower in confusion brb
Brb?
Kammerjunk: dot dot dot
Nice job, RainbowDASH

Tear down the wall!

Kammerjunk: You just tore down The Wall. I thought you loved The Wall
But you have betrayed The Wall
No, not the Wall. Just the wall.
Go now and live your life in SHAME!
The metaphorical wall.
the 4th wall
That we metaphorically build up around ourselves.
Nick broke it
im writing the most messed up fanfic
Kammerjunk: I like to sleep under the sky and in a wide grassland
if there was a 5th wall, it would break it
Morty if your done i would like to read it
Don't judge me
That's terrifying.
:(
:'(
Morty - that would be the wall between humans and "god"
Ictiv: Metaphorically?
it has pinkie, deadpool, godzilla, the author, and Dr. Manhatten
or in some circles, the wall between humans and Morgan Freeman
Kammerjunk: Both
Kammerjunk: Well not all the time
So you're a pretty open hermit.

Well imma go play some... game or something

I wondered why music started
I wondered what the fuck was causing the music
I wasnt the only one???
hey Twilightsparkle how u doing
Fine and you?
good
05its awesome music
Got confused i wondered how music magiced out of my pc while i was downstairs
would've been cooler if you put something on with more shock value to begin with, like csi miami intro
to make us shit our pants
forogt i had stream open, was confused where the music was from
likewise kwak, I was sure I paused youtube and forgot this was open

Thanks.
08,01but it's evenly blonde now
08,01instead of patchily pink
what tool do you use to draw the scetch Wrek? I used pencil and it kept grabbing the previous lines >< I bet it is brush
00,10Wait so your not gonna go cosplaying as pinkie?
08,01LadyCanary!

Got it!
ASP, Rain

08,01Ansane Sclown Posse?

what ordo?
it says 'twitch' near her head, so I'm assuming it's Pinkie
hmm... probably ordo xenos
Pinkie Pie as Voldo from Soul Calibur. That I can see.
is it that crazy guy from that robot game last night?
although, i can see her as part of ordo hereticus too
a radical xeno.... I could see that, well... we'll see with the new episode how well she works with things other than ponies

That's my homework done. >,<
Lol Doofus same thought
You're asking me Wrek, are you aware of my artistic skills? I have no artistic skills, so I will always say "fantastic" or something to that nature.

What is that in her right hoof?
A flame thrower?

So is that a flame thrower in her right hoof?
dammit! I keep telling myself to watch Wrek at work carefully in order to learn something, but yet I keep missing every single addition
is... is music playing? or did everything just get really quiet?
sooo in 4 h and 30 m we watch a movie?
maybe
Yup paradise92
Yep, well you guys will.
Iron Giant no less <3

to tell you the truth I thought it was Fluttershy
Seriously though.
To me, Pinkamena is just Pinkie's full first name. It has nothing to do with anything sadistic or violent
Im jealous.
The eyes and grin gave it away for me.

0,5For anyone who thinks Derpy is a boy
0,5Derpy is voiced by Tabitha St. Germain, who was not aware at the time that Derpy is female and voiced her "with a neighbor's son in mind." The episode (and Derpy's scene) was storyboarded by Sabrina Alberghetti and Nicole Wang. Alberghetti﻿ was reminded of herself in the portrayal of Derpy as an "accident-prone klutz".
PonyGirl_82: :O are you cocco in the loco?
walkk of text much
who actually thought Derpy was a boy?
that doesn't even make any sense
0,5Dumb people, thats who
i didnt

i just saved a fellow brony from a troll
GET BACK ON TF2! I WANT MAH FAME! D:<

Hi Im back!

yup
Shizuka: yes
/me hugs Shizuka "How are you dear?"

13four hours stuffing folders...
get some coffee
13can't stand coffee
ok
Shizuka: coffee is good, DRINK it
"stuffing folders" wat?
Shizuka true dat
he said he buys the toys and everything.
Shizuka: or 5 hour energy
I dont leave the house without my Rarity in my shirt pocket :p
Alright. TIme to style Rarity's mane

Just one of the wierd things i do :p
Dismo: have fun

i told one of my friends i was a brony, they havnt spoken to me since :(

13stuffing folders... picture if you will a foundation that has brochures und such about how they manage finances und why you should invest in them...
Like when i have deja vous, i need to make sure everything exactly the way it was, or i die
asses..
Fantasy Chess?
unfoundbug: that sucks
Best fantasy chess = Karazhan :P
13now picture a given folder has ten such inserts und brochures und reports
ah, gotcha Shizuka, I did that as temp work as a typesetter
13x100
Golakka: Evil, evil, encounter. Especially when you're on your own.
Cheating bastardy medivh.
13mein finders are white und crackly und numb... so much paper...
I refuse to belive karazhan is soloable
simply because of chessboss
13see what i mean, i can't even spell finger right
/me can solo up to chess boss on paladin.
soloing ICC is easier :)
Shizuka: it rubs the lotion on it's fingers to get better again
/me will admit to not actually -attempting- the chess boss while solo.
:O twilight in a trech coat?
WHERE!?
papercuts are the worst injury workin doin stuff like that
A few pics of Derpy as Daring Doo in that EQD i chuckled
new post
/me falls back in. @_@
Actually, the chess event IS soloable. Not easy, but I believe it's soloable.
Is that heroes 5 or 6?

Oh certainly.
i did however ask a girl i liked if she was into mlp..she said this "what are you a little girl" i asked her if she even saw an episode "no because i'm not a dumb little girl!" she then started laughing at me and started spreading rumors everywhere..sucks that i cant hit girls..

Soloing naxrammas in WoTLK was fun

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzozSSGETJo&feature=youtube_gdata_player cant you spot the brony and the pegasister?
i know i never talked to her again..but don't you hate it when people make fun of you for likeing stuff that they don't like? pisses me off..
Protwarrior + Hpala could easily solo most raids, save ulduar and above
wow posts frequent much
How can a two man group be a solo party?
But were those cards official of fan-made?
Derpy_at_work: none of them are either...they are all assholes

i havent gotten a mlp fim toy what are they like (most of my toy experience is with sonic toys)

SuperBrony64|AFK: I wub woo so bucking much
Mahna mahna?
emangamer: hey. hey. guess what?
also if they gave derpy a voice and a cameo why not do that with octavia? or vinyl scratch?
RAWRity: you're a souless monster who will never love another pony?
Vinyl has only been in one episode for 5 seconds
They cant please anyone fluttershyfan158.
everyone*
Haha Syndicate both are good
emangamer: INCORRECT. Editet version of my fic is up and has been sent to EQD pre-readers.
And when I've been in those 5 seconds it was the best moment ever.
XD
But only KwakLad pings me :p
bartsonic, blind bags are the little 1 inch pony figures. there are 24 in a box, on sale on hasbrotoyshop for around $50
good point canary
Vinyl scratch is best pony~
That's why I use it. KwakLad.
:3
RAWRity: 5 bucks says there are still like 5 errors/typos
emangamer: 5 Bucks Says Nopony But You Will Care.
i got a funny mlp card 4 valentines day..got it from a girl
RAWRity: 5 bucks says you're wrong
I will care.
I handed out MLP Valentines to my homeroom.
No me gusta typos
emangamer: 5 Bucks Would Weigh A Lot. Deer are heavy.
there are 3 mystery ponies in the box :) the rest are labeled on the box itself, but I dont want to spoil the surprise
nikxz gkhzjb jxh
thanks
RAWRity: All my friends point out spelling errors and such but in fan fics make a point of following up with 'But it's a fan fic so who cares really'
:o http://imgur.com/gallery/SXm1e
the only reason derpy was encluded was as a nod to the fans... remember bronys are outside of the demographic and as insensate as it will make people the creators of the show can't go off on a fan service tangent because of a minority
"roses are red summer is in june. no vaentine? then straight to the moon" and it had a picture of celestia
Rawrity: I believe he meant 5 US paper currency.
Cypresswolf: we talkin' bout Blind Bags
?
Dammed shitty flash crashing
has anyone read cupcakes that weird fanfic
i have
it's not good business
RAWrity, yes :)
No mention of that please.
cupcakes! yesh
No bartsonic.
Weird does not BEGIN TO DESCRIBE IT.
Do not mention it.
00,10We dont talk about it around hear bartsonic
my eyes
I don't read any fan fiction
i like it!
guys no cupcakes talk
Inquisitor...I highly doubt we are a minority.
Cypresswolf: those 3 "mystery" ones are probably the special edition Crystal versions of Pinkie, Rarity, and Twilight.
just recieved the box I ordered from Hasbro's toy shop last friday
oh ok first time here
queen_luna that can get you banned <.<
Then read the rules bartsonic.
really?
She didn't know.
im new
Chill everypony.
ik
NICE! but I have to wait 2 days to open them
I just got my welovefine order in today and it had a blindbag in it I got a sperkly twilight sparkle :)
Cypresswolf: funny that would happen today. just got an email that the Blind Bags I ordered from Toy Wiz have shipped.
Cypresswolf: why do you need to wait?
Tara strong doesn't know what trolling means.... WHAT.
?
Lol ^
She doesn't huh.
i got a tattoo of rainbow dashes cutie mark on my arm last week..
Everypony_Loves_Flut: u been trolled
CCCP, The equestia anthem is epic
AWESOME!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=fwERapuM17k
Glakka: so true :)
well think about it Syndicate, if it weren't airing on an obscure channel and had a wider viewing audiance I'm sure they'd have more people inside the demographic watching... think about little 'becca's mom... if they fan nodded everything this community came up with it'd either go over both 'becca and mom's head or downright offend them and that's not good for business
now my arm is 20% cooler
sorry for the block drop
haha

/me gets punched in the face by bronystate
Inquisitor: I wasn't saying that thy should listen to us, I'm just saying that we are definitely the majority here. Bronies are not the minority.
Cypresswolf: FMN?
KwakLad: Someone from bronystate did that ^_^
Friday Movie Night
I Get punched everynight now
i bet it does
Why is this place so awesome ;~; I can't finish anything
KwakLad: me too.
LadyCanary: I remeber it being posted earlier when few people were about, i cant remeber who its by though, can you
sooooooo how is everyone tonight?
<3 brotherswing
sljkgjhmkahb
Syndicate: that remains to be seen, actually. WE think we're the majority because we hang out with other bronies, and frequent Brony sites. But there could be TONS of kids that watch it, but because they're kids, they don't go to the internet sites we frequent.
which is a GOOD THING RAWRity
i originally wanted twilights cutie mark but i changed my mind to rainbow dashes cutie mark..
This requires SCISSORS! be right back :O
epic cupcake time
hey
hi
I'm not for censorship of any kind, but I AM for discression... kids should not be reading stuff like the oft mentioned Cupcakes
hmm twilight just insnt as cool...
We must still try to permiate into the highest reachers of governments, or atleast one

http://www.fu-kit.com/product.php/367/mens-soviet-officers-khaki-wool-greatcoats
ok so I think Mic the Mic might be a little loco in the cocco...
Inquisitor: perhaps so. I just really believe we are the majority. There are so many of us. Hundreds of thousands. And probably more, considering closet bronies.
at the gala!
i like her though..i don't relly hate anyone..except for trixie and gilda..and thats it..
Sumica: You got to punch me 2 nights ago i think :p
Golakka: u have them?
1) Best Pony! Applejack! <3
Its in the post :)
i really hate gilda
Mic the Mic makes really good music, but his streams and all of that other stuff is really weird....
My post was meant for RAWRity.
I'm sure there's a significant population
oh
awsome
/me wants a trench coat now .-.
alls I gotta say is Smarty Pants is best pony... prove me wrong...
no pony (or griffon) should make fluttershy cry!
someponies are still talking about cupcakes...?
Vinyl rather a good coat :)
just remeber this one day in Russia the left will rise
she made fluttershy cry..so i hate her..anyone who makes fluttershy cry is dead to me!!
using it to make a point bartsonic
2) Rainbow Dash
dem cupcakes are good eating...I like chocolate with chocolate icing and sprinkles
Inquisitor: that isn't how you spell Fluttershy.
yesh.
oh ok
:3
Yo
the moment you look at Smarty Pants to make your assessment will prove me right, you all know it
I had cupcakes with a cookie dough topping

welcome back Wrek, have a good nico-stick?
We have been lied to.We have been decieved.This "Celestia" is no princess, SHE IS A TYRANT!She has﻿ forced us into neer slavery.She sent our true ruler to the moon for a thousand years before letting her return, all because she wanted a little more attention.It is time we rise up.It is time we take arms.Brothers and sisters are you with me?Today we fight for the true ruler of Equestria
hi everypony!! i got grounded for the semester :( in other news, this is the 14th year in a row i dont have a special somepony. :'(
http://imgur.com/gallery/hWgtM
sorry for text wall
Oh hey Wrek
3) Rarity - I think I can see where this is going - Mane 6 is at the front of the box, so anypony having a hard time finding Mane 6 in blind bag boxes, you have a clue why :)
05sorry bout that
05my addictions got the best of me
It's fine, we can wait c:
use ebay
i wonder how old celestia is...probably as old as the sun.
CCCP3: I like Celestia.
:3
16 billion years?
luna is better!
i don't know
4) Twilight Sparkle
Syndicate: shes probobly corrupt in some way
if celestia is a princess then where is the king and queen? shouldn't she be queen celestia?
^ true
CCCP: our world leaders are more corrupt and we deal with them.
Queen = Evil, Princess = Good
EXACTLY@!
if celestia learns something about friendship who does she send letters to
she was made a princess on hasbro's request. She was originally going to be queen, according to lauren faust.
o crap! moms home gtg baiiii :)
oops an @
What we watchin?
Indeed dken
princess luna = evil
fluttershyfan158 they addressed that issue... they wanted to make her Queen Celestia, but because of disney fairy tales, Queens are always evil... dems the times we live in
CCCP: if the entire society is formed of ponies and foals where are the fully grown horses?
Pon_Jovi232: Where watching Wrek play Might and magic
Syndicate: But she has the power to watch your every move and control the freaking sun
wow i got kild by a heave 2 times
Okay
buuuut shes good now..
were*
oooh....nervermind
5) Sugar Grape - white pegasi with two toned purple hair & Grape cutie mark
/me goes back to ninja business
CCCP: but she doesn't do anything with the information. So who cares?
Pretty
KwakLad: hmmmm.... let me think about tjat
CCCP: maybe the King and/or queen are with the other adults?
/me smudges smudge_proof
yesh i see the liiight!
Syndicate: but the scary thing is she coould. Shes been alive for a long time she might get bored and go insane
05i love this game
05rain
05thanks alot
I am unsmudgeable, Syndicate
6) <3 Fluttershy
KwakLad: mabey its like neverland
CCCP: if she hasn't already, I doubt she will at all.
05i cant even begin to say how much I appreciate it
I just think that use of the word "Ponies" is simply because it's a fun word to say... "Pony"
^
celestia never ages in Family Aprreciation Day she looked the same in granny smith's flashback
is going to hang out on the desktop instead of going back in the bag :)
holy hell
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X21S0estDI&t=34s
who likes mlp amvs
Syndicate: thats resonable but who knows she could be getting ready for somthing big
Some military salute, a guy getas his betret shot off
CCCP: How so? they just dont age? But what of death? and that old pony we saw, wait error in both our arguments, and Old Pony!
gasp
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z365VSUWKs&feature=related
an not and*
brb
CCCP: in that case, there's no stopping her. She's a goddess, and alicorn, and controls the sun. I think she wins.
>_>

7) Lily Blossom
Hey everypony :)
everything has a weakness..
Hi tgl1992

Shizuka: in the theatre pages can you add an element with ' id="Script119609" ', my script probably wont work and its easier to dissable it than have a lot of people bug me about breakage
tabs or multiscreen
05,15Image links are okay as long as they follow the rules and are relevant
13script?
21) Special Edition Pinkie Pie
Cypresswolf :O
