I enjoy cod because of how fast paced the gameplay in multiplayer it.

Like, you always have to be on guard, at all times.
I prefer RTS
You can get the same effect with slow gameplay.

Planetside 2 is like that
Not in as strong of doses though.
I like it how klrpwny only jumps in on a PS2 discussion and nothing else

*Sigh*
It's good to be home.

Come on guys, let's be respectful of each other.
I'm not being disrespectful.
08,01on the train going to england
That is pretty ballar Saturn
08,01meeting with BUCK's venue
No-one is being disrespectful. Lel.
At least not at the moment.
08,01need to vigorously persuade them that theyre taking the piss with their prices this year
Jeez, I hate Labyrinth Zone sometimes.
08,01what ever is on the strream sucks, and the streamer should feel bad for playing it

Have you been slacking off?
08,01AJIsAwesome: that's fa worse!
08,01i think ive written about 6 separate soduku solvers over the years
Saturn: Ouch. I was considering CS. Instead I'm going for maths, my real passion. (I'd rather develop the equations than implement them)
08,01im the opposite
THIS! IS! EXITEING!!!
08,01last night, i wrote a garbage collector
This! Is! Sparta!
Saturn: Like... recycle bin?
Yeah! >_>
Saturn: Now I'm intrigued. Was this a program to be run on a garbage collection device, or was it a "garbage collector" to be run in/alongside a program to collect its garbage?

I'd rather play something good.
would play TF2, but I still haven't downloaded yet
I'd rather express my creative mind then listen to a child scream over the microphone.
I haven't played tf2 yet either, which is why I was seeing if tf2 would be picked more, if it was preferred more than MC, I would have downloaded it.
someone respects them!
Oh how many times I've seen that.
lol
dat tl;dr
lol
But Borderlands 2 is terrible and people prefer that over good games.
You're one to talk.
As a child I was.

How childish.

You can't escape MURIKA'S wrath boy.
You can never stop a tard from starting a topic.
Listening to the radio the other day, a Dairy Queen worker called up and explained how they make the buns for their burgers - the slather on some butter on each bun, and toast it where the butter melts into the bread, and crispy just on the underside
Nor can you end it.
and then there was something about pies and I lost my train of thought and stop listening
And he leaves.
Good.
Spoke too soon.
mesmerized by the image :)
aww
I didn't see it as rude.
Somewhere around there.

Wow.

That looks nasty.
That looks about right.

It's from a restauraunt called "The Pantry" they make some of the biggest pancakes I have ever seen.
that doesn't look much like a pancake
sooo....
Looks tasty

an*
THere is quite alot of /me in here today, haha
/me likes /me
/me licks Socks...
Use it too much and it could be dangerous
/me tears a hole in DoctoDoctorWho's stomach and heads for the appendix
like getting banned
it could happen
Yep
it happened to me
Yep yep, not like I even care anymore.
:D
Dat dari
it just didn't lift
aha
Why put the functionality into the system if you don't want people to use it? <--(knows nothing about IRC)
Bans don't lat for fixed times, they're all permanent on IRC
last*
and apparently you all forgot
9:15 is me http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0JME7eodTk
*an
I know
/me appears in purple in mIRC
No shit >_>
:D
>implying mIRC is for mods specifically
mIRC is pretty good.
Am I wrong on that count? Oh :( Socks does bad internets
>actually using a shitty web client
Lel
Socks does real bad internets.
As I say I know nothing about IRC, this is my first one :P
I use Hydrairc
There is no standard IRC client though
I think socks means the web client
*standard
The roleplay rule doesn't have anything to do with the the colour of /me anyway
It's just because we aren't a roleplay room.
the /meing died down quite a lot...
If people want to RP they can go do it in an RP room
Lol
I used to RP like you.
But then my D&D team just kinda fell apart.
Which is a bad move.
I JUST DONT FUCKING CARE!
Sorry if I'm being irritating I just want to know where I stand :P
its just slightly ridiculous why I was banned
You stand on thin ice at all times.
I was banned for a minute a couple of weeks ago.
but beware, it might just break...
i guess no ponies this year :<
Splendidus narratio, frater.
And not one shit was given.
Well, knock yourself out.
or get...
Okay
sacrifice me
Of all the STUPID!
ASANI!
And not just any beef. That special kind of beef you can only get from the backs of well-fed cows.
SUBJECTIVE BULLSHIT!!
/me could care less about saiyans...
I couldn't.

That's a silly saying, really. "I could care less."

I'll be eating some nice lasagna tonight.
Back from an unsaid BRB, I was eating a sandwhich in slow motion.
/me Is literally twitching with rage
Neat.
It's not healthy.
Yep

I could do
If I can be bothered to stream
Which is never.

Hi everypony.

Oh look a stream ^_^
how much is it's budget?
<_< Seems Legit >_>
Budget:
$CAD100,000 (estimated)
but that's just me
Raubtier?
I think.
*^^^
:D
Metal especially.
We'll probably do something, but I don't think anything is currently planned
People don't respect music like they did back in the day.
the same could be said back in the day
Also, I HEAR NIGHTWISH (I think)
R.I.P. Headphone users
05soudns like someone needs more sabaton
hai guys
:3
slow day for streaming
I can never understand metal
It just seems like a bunch of screaming
But thats just me I suppose
Rain!
05i liek this song jsut for its guitar
05but proper metal is queued after
last contracted season
they may make another season or two if contracts are renegotiated
But to be fair, a lot of metal bands use the loud random banging, but somehow it works.
I want some pony!
^
Okay :P
05XxNightHawk64xX: you sound like you are condemign a whole genre based os a sub type os said genre
05of*
SABATOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
05now here you got some proper metal
I dont like metal but I dont say I hate all of it, I just find it my thing
*dont
/me also loves sabaton <3 :3
I tend to respect people tastes
Unless its garbage....but anyway
BLASTPHOMY
is it just me or is the sound quality of this track a bit rough?
Yeah
It was last saturday
It does sound a bit fuzzy.
*sunday
Its meh
Then metal moved in.
The ammount of glitches can be hilarious sometimes
:D
TO THE MOOOOOOOOON
05no, you're still complainin'
mine as well
Weh weh weh weh
YESSSSSSSS

DKC SERIES all the way, and PLOK

I didn't really like Sandopolis. Probably because I kept timing out.
....
Really?
But I still like the music of Sandopolis.
I never liked the whole alien bullshit
Carnival Night act 2 was the only time i got a time over
Its not bad once you figure it out but its kind of ambiguous to press up and down

no opinion on my review..........i forgot the kickass soundtrack and intense battles
but seriously
wacha chatin aout?
Sticker Star.
removing the charm in it
no level up upgrades
no badge points
no FP points
You collect stickers to use in battle, and they're gone once you use them.
yeah
You have no partners either
and that's an item
3dsa
3ds**
also
STAGES
I'm back.
yeah Stages
mmhmm
it's not open world no more
it's stages
Speaking of which
no story
You'll get used to it like Luigi's Mansion!
Didn't people say that the 3DS'graphics are comparable to the Gamecube?
but it's not
not much never played it before right now i am playing malifaux doctordoctorwho
Used to be underrated, but thanks to Let's Plays, peoples opinions had changed.
:D
askstalkerloo is getting married
where's the story
where's the humour
where's the badges
it scares me
is there a story to it?
who* :P
the levels has no backstory at all
unlike the previous games where each world had some interesting background
:(
Tee hee hee, hee hee hee hee
maybe
with me and my 1000 coins
right after the first world
.......gosh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ
but yeah really sad to see that there's no partners
especially when I thought we would have a chain chomp partner
lergmaflishpelgmaninerpfishdoloodlepkerloopydop
?
I think the internets affecting me...
Which version?
which is $14
but
I kid you not Ranger Smith: "Do not molest the animals because they are under the protection of the government"
I'm going to hope in that context it meant "fuck with" not "fuck"
let me see if i can find the episode online
hopefully i get the derpy <3
no stream?
*sigh* I forgot how tedious breeding for natures are...
no stream atm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jruPdPAQbxU

bc it didn't sell
that's why
Skies of Arcadia FTW!
his ears deflated :\
Billy Hatcher 2...Ecco III.
ooooh
someone wanted the infamous proof lol
Comix Zone was hard as fuck...
Comix Zone was unique on its own
it doesn't need a sequel
Comix Zone WAS hard
goddammit it was hard
OK SEGA, bring back Ecco, Comix zone, Earthworm ji, etc...
gtg everypony see ya all tomorrow
I know you can get Ecco and Ecco 2 on Nintendos virtual consol.
Shining...Freaking...FORCE!
Heard it was an RPG...
ehh?
Bye Dark-
yes

I mean, Billy is awesome...he rolls up eggs, hatchs up eggs, and defeat crows...
bah
SKIES OF ARCADIA!

I don't like the modern games, and can't understand how people do
yes the one and only
/me used to watch that show
don't forget they also rule 34 the shit out of the main characters as well
HUEHUEHUE
Sorry for the spam...
But you get the idea.

Wheres the episode
http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/loadingreadyrun/1877-The-Arms-Race
but i haven't heard of any clop fics with said rule 34
6_9
:P
there's alot of erotic fanfic
with rule 34 in it as well?
I think i'm seeing a patern here before Colours camed out...
oh wait
The games were bad...but the music are good...
i was thinking of Rule 63
The whole gender thing?
Rule 63+clop fiction i meant

I like ponies
:3
Ranma 1/2 = The birth of Rule 63.

Speaking of SEGA, Rome 2 Total War is being made.
<.<
which one
The Porygon episode?!
But still, <3
you should watch the Beach episode
and it wasn't Porygon's fault either
and Everytime The brats fall for it
inflatable breasts but breasts nonetheless
inflatable ones, that was even the joke
Did you know there is a fail rate for a Master Ball
A fail rate...for the fucking Master Ball?
hi everypony:)
...Psshnah!
Reason for the Beach episode in the U.S. was because they feared it would promote gay lifestyles
'Tis a joke.
