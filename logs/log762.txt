Dat kick
I feel bad for making her type that much
sorry D:
You should, Jmo. :I
Jmo has feelings?
It was an auto-kick aniderp
^
Pokecolt: I dont think so.
'Jmo has feelings'
It's just there to stop spammers aniderp :P
;_; i will sit in corner now :<
Who got kicked?
You'd be surprised fewl.
Jmo finally got his emotional core fixed?
aniderp: it was an automated thing, dont feel bad
It was never broken.
I'm surprised you feel anything Jmo after killing all those orphans and burning down their houses. :>
Sure it wasn't.
i got that before and i didnt mean to get it
aniderp: just be careful then :P
AJIsAwesome: It was just offline
I feel joy when I'm beating you to the pulp.
typing to fast maybe
DoctoDoctorWho: I'm talking to Moojay.
Oh I see how this is Jmo :D
lol Moojay
AJIsAwesome: I was refering to him
my one sock has a hole in it..
Both of my socks have holes in them, am I special?
aniderp: I know that feel ;~;
hole on bottom making my foot cold..
Jmo: yush

Jmo: XD
Lern tuh speel, Moojay.

Alright, one thing I appreciate about this game by far.
Is it shows how long it is going to take to finish your reload.
All orks is equal, but sum ar moar equal den uvvas.
Pokecolt: like Ghost Recon
Pokecolt, and only that? .-.
too bad i cant really watch stream :<
is good aniderp
Lol, not only that, I will say the points I appreciate about this game. That being one of them. :)
brb
good Pokecolt
lol
What is with people and points? .-.
I like having a clear immersive hud ;~;
AdamTheDuck: points are credit to team!!
Yeah but it's like BF3 all over agian, spamming my screen with *10 points heal* *10 points heal*
Want to know the reason I enjoy cod though?
I enjoy cod because of how fast paced the gameplay in multiplayer it.
is*
Like, you always have to be on guard, at all times.
Pokecolt: Me too
I prefer RTS
You can get the same effect with slow gameplay.
^
Planetside 2 is like that
Not in as strong of doses though.
AdamTheDuck: true
I like it how klrpwny only jumps in on a PS2 discussion and nothing else
reminds me of deadpool
lol
Only jumps GW2 discussions
Well gee Jmo i just got home from school
YOU DON'T GO TO SCHOOL
DON'T LIE.
lol
lolwut
LIES.
You don't have feeling, Jmo.
Don't lie.
Dema begs to differ.
Pokecolt, have you seen how cautious you have to be in games like Red Orchestra?
Jmo u jelleh dat u nevah went tu schuul?
But Dema isn't here, so...... :P
I finished school last year.
Lawl.
Jmo: 3old5me
...wut
Do you have a translate sheet or something for me?
Jmo: 2old4me, then.
:|
Lawl.
Pokecolt, communicating to your team, getting Artillery coordinates and getting your team commander to call an airstrike as you watch your enemies fall as you charge in to take back the Moscow?
back Moscow*
damn I am sleep XD
RANDOM MOMENT HERE: One of my favorite games from back in ps2 days were socom: navy seals.
sleepy... *
AdamTheDuck: LIES, YOU'RE AWAKE
I loved that game, a lot.
First game to use voice recognition for when you ordered your bot team to do things.
Wut?
Although voice recognition has been there since Hey you, pikachu.
Wait
Battlefield 2?
Wow, voice chat with bots
Dayum.
Lol.
or Tom Clancy's EndWar?
Dayum sumi your coughing like hell
^
I honest to god wish that I could relate to any of this
What would one call a pony who plays video games? (There docto, get involved on this topic. :P)
Disciple of luna?
I was thinking something with Luna, yeah.
Heh, moreso. What would a pony be named if it had a game controller cutie mark. ;)
is half life 2 episode 1 the same story as half life?
.-.
Not sure if trolling or stupid.
hmmm
I am really ashamed. I am in love with two games I never played... :< And it's depressing.
Oh Jmo, not everyone knows their gaming history :P
Stupid money, why can't you live in my pocket and not everywhere else?
But Half-life.
Pokecolt: I know that feel bro
The two games I love and have never played.
Is portal 1 and portal 2.
Pokecolt, my feeling after any Steam sale
You think your wallets have had it bad .-.
Jmo, shush you :$
I'm not the one trying to get 2000 games on Steam :$
Pfft
Poor ass.
I really hope PokeMMO continues to get updated in the future, the concept for pokemmo is awesome. Not to mention... I really... really... REALLY FRIGGIN LOVE this pixelmon mod I have for minecraft.
It's so awesome.
cuz i havnt played any of the half lifes and theres a bundle for half life with all its expansions and half life 2 with all its crap not sure if its just redundant
There's a big plot gap between HL1 and HL2 tbh
/me doesnt have a job
Pokecolt: The Powerglove?
Still good to play the first one though
^
Oh my god.. Hello everpony!
I think I am going to eat nothing all day, and just absolutely overencumber eat thanksgiving dinner.
but back to my question is episode 1 the same as half life storyline?
Hello Firelight
Meh, I wished I liked Thanksgiving food.

I never knew we were friends.
1995-2012
:>
;_;
Jmo: well whatever we were it stops here
Ahahahaha
So amusing.
....
unfortunately windows is borked so i'm installing sp1 from safe mode
no sound :(
and no ability to start the sound service
Windows hates you too.
Jmo: it really does
Will it make you feel better if I say I liked Linux?
it would
I admit Linux was amazing to use, completely different from Windows.
Learning it was fun.
ubuntu is pretty good....
problem with ubuntu is for users like me its terrible
Why no nothing in stream thing going on? D:
It's something called a break Pokecolt.
very heavy, minimal customization in the default ui, just different enough from debian to be problematic
Jmo: blasphemer
:> I know, I just like being ridiculous. O=3
Oh someone else that uses =3
but if you want 'not windows' use ubuntu
it's probably easiest
Still yet to use Snow Leopard
Mountain Lion*
i'm yet to use osx at all
no mac hardware and it hates virtual machines
so how about them ponies
if you ask abotu ponies.. g3 is played
Nice of the princess to invite us over for a picnic, eh Luigi?
or was it 3.5?
if I request ponies
Ponies, ponies, ponies.
Give us ponies.
did someone ask for ponies?
<:
but ...ponies are fun... :(
xD

I didn't request them, just was talking about them
Jmo: Shut up. :I
Give us special ponies.
Ponies nao~

Chrysalis: Jmo is demanding ponies, the others are tying to stop that

That's why I want ponies. :>
But there's Youtube for that. :<

AJIsAwesome: you read my mind

AJIsAwesome: are you a wizard?
Phase4: I have no idea.
He wishes.

AJIsAwesome: harry, you're a wizard
Jmo: I don't.
2144 is the time.
00:44 here

Jmo: Down Under where?

aniderp: Shoo be doo~
Tssk.

haidere
Jmo: What do you mean? I wasn't making a joke.
i listend to it once earlier
D: AJIsAwesome! GO TO BED!
D:
As if you don't know what Down Under means.
What the hell.
But I don't want to. :<
AJIsAwesome: :)
Jmo: As if you don't know what a joke is.
the fma one :P
'I wasn't making a joke'
wooo!
Jmo: so, australia
Kinda makes that whole invalid.
Jmo: "That's the joke."

Phase4: we apparently do
Phase4: No. :D
i sometimes sing sea ponies.. o.O
Intially, that is retarded.
.-.
because we're all fucking morons
Initially*
that catchy
All humans are morons.
<_<
cause i'm australian and i've never cooked shrimp on a bbq
Speak for yourself Ayejay.
only steak, sausages and onions
Jmo: Not the Liarjack emote.
*Note
i think i cooked some fresh fish once
Boop. :3
On a client, don't see those silly emoticons.
point is no shrimp
now to go on omegle and the question thingy and sea ponies!
Jmo: Sucks for you, then.
Neither have I Phase4
Not really.
... Phase, I wanted shrimp too. :<
Pokecolt: This stream's the boopinest!
BOOPINEST!?
BOOPS.
also aparently what you call shrimp we call prawns, shrimp here are the tiny babby ones
I love boops.
:3
I used to live on a yabby farm.
That was fun.
prawns are the big 8cm long things
everyone is d/c :<
Prawns here are generally larger sized shrimp, almost the size of crayfish.
Jmo: yabby's are fun
aniderp: Not everyone likes seaponies. :<
And that is where the tale of the spider the size of a car wheel came from.
i said sea ponies shoo be doo!
AJIsAwesome: Blasphemy!
blasforyou
no one responded to that question yet :<
blasforeverybodyintheroom
What was yuour question aniderp?
I love dikekike mlp youtube poops...

Chrysalis: Iseewhatyoudidthere.jpg
Chrysalis: blasforeverypony

Ohh that question.
for the question thingy.. someone said no ;_;
and d/c
Chrysalis: and i have no idea who that is

>.>
... I hate ADD... I keep turning my head towards the spinning circle on the stream. >_<
Make the circle go away. ;-;
Chrysalis: i still have no idea who that is :P
someone is in distress!
Chrysalis: oh yeah, I remember that one
a great comedian
Call upon the sea ponies.
But they aren't here.
also a crossdresser
They will be.
:>
Eventually, but not now. :<
yes people answering!
did the raptor and a cow in a car sketch
Have you guys watched family guy before? :3
Ew Family Guy
D:!
I have, don't really like it.
Anywho, if you have. I want to reference something in it.
i like the star wars parodys
Shoot.
There is something Death does in family guy, that I tried one day... and it's really friggin good.
Star Wars episodes were good.
I used t watched family guy, but then it got a bit tedious with the jokes
He spread butter on the top of a fried chicken leg.
And it was so nummeh delishness of deliciousness~!
normal family guy is hit and miss, not bad but i'd prefer simpsons or furutrama
furutrama
terrible show
hehhehehehe
Bob's burgers is the worst out of everything though.
Hi everypony
people dont respect sea ponies ;_;
Pokecolt: i actually like bobs burgers
...
lali-ho TheDamShadow01
so, how about that spanish inquistion
What?
its sometimes quite clever
Seriously phase?
Bob's Burgers is good
I love it
...
/me headwalls.
Headwall harder pls.
break dat wall
IMA BREAK THIS WALL WITH MY FACE.
^
Do it.
reboot time
I saw it streamed here, it doesn't really appeal to me.
Careful Pokecolt that is the 4th wal you are headwalling! Pinky has already hurt it enough
lol i guess the chat is having a bad day
We are?
nah it's sometimes like this
Why you say that dam?
just cause
Such a great reason.
Bravo.
i dont have anything to do XD
I've broken the 4th wall already rommulus, now I am working on the fifth and sixth walls. (Ceiling and floor.)
:3
You could ponder the meaning of life?
just gona play TF2
AJIsAwesome: there is no meaning
Curious question so I can get some decent responses.
What would you guys rather play...
cowvarkian: Different views for different people.
Minecraft OR Team Fortress 2.
TF2.
Minecraft.
Actually, both.
TF2
AJIsAwesome: well, there's no objective reason
XD
I'd rather play something good.
would play TF2, but I still haven't downloaded yet
Pokecolt: minecraft
I'd rather express my creative mind then listen to a child scream over the microphone.
I haven't played tf2 yet either, which is why I was seeing if tf2 would be picked more, if it was preferred more than MC, I would have downloaded it.
someone respects them!
stranger 2 said yay
Pokecolt: Seeing how they're different gameplay styles, I can't see either one as better than the other.
Jmo: OMG STOP HACKING I'LL REPORT YOU MY BROTHER OWNS STEAM SIAJSLAKNDVONAM
My meaning of life is Waiting for something cool to happen XD (well that isn`t but well college)
I wish they would make a mod for tails in minecraft. ;-;
Oh how many times I've seen that.
lol
Even though they are different gameplay styles AJIsAwesome. I like to compare games like AC3 and Halo 4 at times. Even though they are different gameplay styles, just getting an idea of a game that is more played and preferred than others gives me a general good idea which would be a better choice to pick.
If a game isn't good, it wouldn't be preferred over the other choice. :3
dat tl;dr
lol
But Borderlands 2 is terrible and people prefer that over good games.
Dat short attention span.
You're one to talk.
Jmo, you a pokemon fan?
How so?
As a child I was.
i like pokemon
i dont no if i buy Fraps for Record things XD
:>
If so, I HIGHLY RECCOMEND (caps was needed) you try the Pixelmon mod for Minecraft.
The fact I don't play Minecraft anymore makes me think otherwise.
D:!
I childish mod for a childish game?
lol
Minecraft was only fun during Alpha/Beta
How childish.
Buytoast: >.>
Buytoast, you are NEVER too old for pokemon.
how has minecraft been? all I remmber last time was some update with cats
and that crash is fixed
So your argument is invalid. :|
Pokecolt, don't listen to him.
HAPPY THANKS GIVING
i can only assume it was a problem with retail win 7 and efi
You're never too old until you grow up.
Happy Thanksgiving, TheKoreanBrony1354. :)
lali-ho TheKoreanBrony1354, and happy turky day to you too
Deacon, minecraft's mechanics are so much better since those days. Good stuff has been added since then, more ambience.
It's really awesome.
STUFF ADDED?
TO MINECRAFT?
AHAHAA
Well instead of turkeywe have rice
Buytoast: don't you watch a show with frilly multi-colored ponies made for little girls?
TheKoreanBrony1354: Meh, never really liked turkey.
Aaand then the MLP joke
lol
I only watch mature MURIKAN shows
You can't hate a nice white piece of turkey meat smothered in mashed potatoes, gravy and covered in corn.
Like Lizard Lick Towing
Buytoast: like MLP
With a side of biscuits.
and Operation Repo
Lel
parade on!
you mean the parade that's the same every year?
Dat's dat.
Got dat?
That's good for you.
maybe ponies be in parade!
You can't be an MURIKAN if you still play those little kid japanses pet shop fighter games boy.
Buytoast: yes you can
lol
You gotta play the games on Uncle Sam's Jam List.
Call of Duty
Medal of Honor
Assassin's Creed 3
Hello everypony!
I can tell XAX is laughing right now.

i think ponies are in the parade!
Buytoast: yes they are ._.
If they were, why did manifest destiny make us the true MURIKANS?
because we're dickheads?
I am hungry for this...
http://www.thenationalstudent.com/articleImages/junkfood.jpg
Correction.
We're MURIKANS.
That's what I thought.
Freedom wins again.
I am such a fatty. ;-; Want to know why? I was able to name nearly every type of meat on that sandwich by it's look.
D:
Buytoast: no
Jesus.
Buytoast, screw Manifest Destiny
Screw manifest destiny?!
yes
Son, without yer manifest destiny, you wouldn't be able to enjoy your Whopper with your large drink.
I don't like whoppers, or soda
Buytoast, as in I'm sick of it. I'm sick of being associated with it.
Instead, you'd be eating saerkraut in yer leaderhosen while reading Mein kampf before tucking into your hitler approved bed.
Buytoast, Manifest Destiny doesn't result in freedom. It only results in tyrrany.
that seems a bit unlikely
I don't know what your problem with sauerkraut is
people
I like sauerkraut
aniderp: I'm one of those
worlds greatest character ballons
What's everyone's favorite type of juice?! :D
you think rainbow dash or ponies will be in?
Pokecolt: mango
Buytoast: What makes a hitler approved bed?
i hope they arr <3
My favorite type of juice is... Hm, never really thought about it.
I like grape juice.
It has to be very kampfy
berry juice
LOL.
:| Does berry juice count? I mean, mixed berry juice maybe...
i like mixed berry also
I have never tried this, can anyone give an opinion on it if you have had it?
How is Peach Pie?
Peachy.
God I'm gonna hurt myself for that.
/me headwalls again.
Seriously Jmo?
D<
:>
It had to be done.
Jmo, that's like saying corn tastes corny. >:C
Listen here boy.
It does. Ahaha
Buytoast, I'm 34. Don't call me boy
Buytoast: no thanks
If God didn't want us to be MURIKA.
Does fish taste fishy too Jmo?
Kandarihu, he's just trying to rustle jimmies.
Then why didn't he stop us?
BOOM
This is what he finds entertainment.
Buytoast: because there is no god
Freedom wins again.
REV UP THOSE JIMMIES
Jmo, then pardon me for letting him. These are fighting words.
You can do what you want, but I'm just saying.
Pudding sounds delicious right now.
Don't worry son, MURIKA will never waver.
Buytoast: yes it will
We'll stand strong.
If atheists are so bad, then why didn't AthiestZilla attack Tokyo instead of GODZilla?
Some like, banana cream pudding with homemade sliced bananas, topped in whipped cream with cinnamon sprinkled on top.
Ooh my.
On the cirpses of our enemies and eating our Freedom Fries with our extra grande all MURIKAN soft drinks.
Buytoast, we already have. We reelected a virtual dictator of a President, so we're going to have to pay a very dire price if we're ever going to learn our lesson
(If you can't tell, I talk about food and beverages to try to leviate the stress of arguments, no one can hate food. :) )
OMG Food Talk! ^_^
/me likes water
^ Eats ice and drinks water for his diet.
Let it be known cowvarkian is now a plant.
:)
And those of us who voted against the creep will pay the same price. We'll all suffer together.
Kandarihu: cool
cowvarkian, don't you start
ok, I'll stop starting
Jmo. I am trying so hard to pull the topic away. :'(
You can't escape MURIKA'S wrath boy.
Buytoast: sure we can
Buytoast, shut up
You can never stop a tard from starting a topic.
Listening to the radio the other day, a Dairy Queen worker called up and explained how they make the buns for their burgers - the slather on some butter on each bun, and toast it where the butter melts into the bread, and crispy just on the underside
Nor can you end it.
Cypresswolf: The more you know.
As much as he finds this entertainment and is trying to rustle so many jimmies, he is looking like the biggest retard right now.
and then there was something about pies and I lost my train of thought and stop listening
Jmo, so am I
And he leaves.
Good.
Spoke too soon.
Jmo: SPOKE2SOON
mesmerized by the image :)
aww
Kandarihu, you aren't in the wrong.
Jmo, it doesn't matter what he was doing to provoke me. I was rude to a fellow user. There's no excuse for that.
:3 you how to make grilled cheese, try this - take 5 or 6 squares of a hershey bar peanut butter and fry it the same way ^_^
Arguing political philanthropy is like arguing about circles. You will never have the edge, and it will never end on any side.
I didn't see it as rude.
Pokecolt: >.> tru fax
At least you said stuff that was at least of value.
How did this all get started again?
Was it Pokemon or something?
Buytoast: by you
Buytoast: I'll check
"Buytoast: STUFF ADDED? Buytoast: TO MINECRAFT? Buytoast: AHAHAA"
Somewhere around there.
AHAHAA
Minecraft
Hi cypress wolf. :) How are you?
Cypresswolf: >.>
jklafdas I REMEMBER WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. Caps cause I made my voice sound louder for a reason. >:C
Brb going to go download the call of duty mystery box sound. (Going to become my text message tone)
Cypresswolf: and makes you five pounds heavier
^ But well worth it
when you say chocolate, do you mean the low grade hershey bars, or some chocolate actually worth eating
I'd like to make to Texas state fair next year - all those new deep fried confectionaries they come out with each year....best food porn there is!
Wow.
I don't want to live on this planet anymore
That looks nasty.
That looks about right.
and asking the vendors how they make them :) makes you want it even more
thats a giant pastry, not a pancake
It's an apple pancake, coated in sugar and cinnamon crisp Jmo. :)
Return to your ME3 lolz boy
That is nasty Pokecolt, not even gonna lie.
I'm not sure what that mess even is O_o
It's from a restauraunt called "The Pantry" they make some of the biggest pancakes I have ever seen.
that doesn't look much like a pancake
Looks like something that'll give your heart a run for its money.
Hold on, I will find some of there other non-added flavored pancakes.
sooo....
:) This is the best food I've ever had - http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0TpeqdtdG_XFBC_Ossox9g/l.jpg - Cheesecake Factory's Hibachi Steak! - the sweetness of the steak is the PERFECT contrast to the wasabi mashed potatoes - they take some butter and wasabi powder to make the gravy, I dont know what they do to the poatoes to make them taste the way they do, but it's the mashed potatoes that make the meal
Looks tasty
^
:) You're missing out
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
and i'm hungry:|
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
Open your eyes, look up to the stars and seeeeeeee
Food?
I'm just a poor boy, I get no sympothy
Happy Hearth's Warming Eve everypony!
Hi everypony.
Allo
ohey
http://bacontoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Giant-Bacon-Sandwich.png --- this picture can give people heart attack's just looking at it. xD
that's not even a sandwich
thats just a pile of bacon with bread
x3
It has onion on the side cow!
Look at the back.
Happy Turkey day everypone
SANDWHICH!
You can see onions.
Pokecolt: that makes it so much better
Also G'morning
x
x3*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYAGB11YrSs
Pokecolt: Who needs the bread? Just order it like this - http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Bacon_6b8ba3_1779234.jpg
One of the greatest things I have ever eaten though, was something here in Tennesee, USA. It was a pulled pork sandwich made with homemade Apple Cider BBQ sauce. It was, literally, the greatest sandwich I have ever eaten, and possibly may ever eat.
Cypresswolf: When will people learn that you can't properly link to FunnyJunk
I love apple cider personally, so it just made the bbq sauce have an extra tang to it, and... it was just so good.
This is an actual burger here in town: http://www.ibetyouwont.com/monster-burger-challenge-at-flippin-eggs/
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGXFrFkxfrI
CUPCAKES! So sweet and tasty! CUPCAKES! Don't be too hasty! CUPCAKES! Cupcakes, cupcakes, cupcakes! (THAT IS NOT THE FAN-FICTION.)
Eddmario: http://i4.asntown.net/bacon_mountain_-ttce.jpg - that better?
Cypresswolf: Now I want bacon..
:3 http://www.impactlab.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Bacon-Mountain-695.jpg - The Promised Land O_O
Cypresswolf: HOLY CRAP! The whole pig is right on top!
One of the best things I ever cooked myself, like homemade. Was a layer of hash browns coverd in bbq pulled pork, topped with two slices of bacon and two eggs.
I will get that thing put on breakfast menus around the globe darn it.
It was just too amazing.
It took 400,000 lbs of bacon to make that mountain
>.>
Isn't 400,000 lbs of bacon like, around 20,000 pigs? o.o
Peeeta
Bacon is delicous.
Peeeeeeeeta
PEETA!?!?
x3
Hes from the hunger games, right?
PETA
One thing I feel bad for eating, but I just love it too much to stop.
Is veal.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0JahhFkts
Not Hunger Games :P
=D
I love veal, even though I know how it's made.
Veal = baby cow, in case any of you have yet to learn. :)
Mooo
veal is delicious
Twilight sparkle's smiley face made that message complete...
It truly did.
:)
"In case any of you have yet to learn :) "
^ Why it was complete.
lamb is pretty good too
I have never tried duck.
Has any of you?
The only way it could've been more complete is if there was a Cheerilee icon
Supposedly duck is really greasey.
I haven't had duck yet
I could never eat duck.
Why?
quack
Cause I've raised ducks .-.
Aw.
well, I might've had duck in some chinese food...
Weirdest cuisine I have ever had (no one get mad at me for saying this) is lebanese cuisine.
It had the oddest flavors.
I can make a mean stew :) Take a couple pounds of ground beef, brown it, 2-3 cans of chili, mix it - let it simmer - add potatoes, stewed tomatoes, carrots, celery, and beans - I prefer black beans for the color, but you can use whatever - I have a secret couple of ingredients I add to ground beef chili base that makes it irresistable :)
haven't had that yet
It was this weird curry that I ate.
Psh, everypony knows chinese food is made with everything but the listed meats
heh
Cypress.
Wanna know what my favorite recipe is?
It's made of cats, dogs, rats, hamsters...
All you have to do is take a cup of flour! Add it to the mix! Now just take a little something sweet, not sour! A bit of salt, just a pinch! Baking these treats is such a cinch! Add a teaspoon of vanilla! Add a little more, and you count to four, And you never get your fill of... Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty!
TELL ME YOUR SECRETSS
:)
StinkomanFan: so that's why the dumplings taste so good...
Anything but Chicken, Pork, or beef
http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/892
U.N Owen was her..
You guys know that guinea pig is actually a really famous meat type, right?
More guinea pigs are eaten a year in comparison to buffalo.
StinkomanFan: http://desiderius.ilcannocchiale.it/mediamanager/sys.user/43344/That_Wasnt_Chicken%5B1%5D.jpg - an honest fortune cookie
buffalo is pretty good
U.N Owen was her..
hey bronies you know what I'm not happy about?
Wut
Are you saying you'd eat Little Strongheart?
Flandre Scarlet...
pony_3290: probably
why isn't mlp in the macy's parade?
Awesome song with a creepy picture.. c:
StinkomanFan: no, because she's sentient
aniderp?
Has anyone here tried rabbit? I hear so much about it, I just don't have the heart to eat them..
http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/887 pone
I would rather not eat things I would keep as pets...
You wouldn't keep a human as pet, so would you eat it?
:P
I love buffalo wings! That's right, buffulo used to be able to fly until a certain Colonel came along >_>
This video will make some of you so happy, I think at least.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqj3iAlfpNM --- pet squirrel.
I wish they had an MLP float in the Macy's parade
I think Macy's is to boring for MLP... MLP needs something greater than Macys..
I think they don't have it because Pinkie Pie would potentially come alive and begin to stomp around New York
A giant, helium filled Pinkie Pie with some poor bastards trapped to it by strings
I really want a pet squirrel now. ;-;
<.<
A giant Pinkie Pie attacking New York, the potential of deaths would be so high that Hasbro'd rather not risk it.
A GIANT PINKIE PIE ATTACKING NEW YORK?!
That would lead to Cupcakes you know..
<.<
im watching macy's parade
I'm sure they still have the giant Pinkie Baloon locked up deep in there facilities.
hopefully rainbow dash will be in parade!
derpy i want derpy!
but she would ruin things ;_;
aniderp: Rainbow Dash + Pinkie Pie + Pinkie Pie ATTACKING New York = Cupcakes or The Rainbow Factory..
Just waiting for the day when they'll have enough money to justify the slaughter of MAttel
who else watching macy parade?
Yahoez darling
got my ipod ready for mlp ballon :>
if they have one which i hope they do
http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/563 Relevant
Is ded chat ded?
I guess not.
hmm
So Kammerjunk, we're talking about potential Macy's day balloons MLP would get
I'm sorry?
Who's Macy?
We decided Pinkie Pie wouldn't make it do to the potential of it coming alive and attacking New York
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is a tradition where a bunch of companies have floats and balloons go around New York for advertising.
Oh.
I see.
Wait, is it Thanksgiving?
Huh. Whaddaya know.
So, what are your thoughts on a giant Pinkie Pie?
Absolutely terrible.
I can imagine.
:O :HI NEW YORK!
And it'd just go downhill from there
I hope there's an MLP balloon somewhere in the parade. How about Fluttershy?
But horses can't talk.
Neitehr can balloons.
Pinkie Pie can.
Because Pinkie Pie
I seriously doubt they'd put a My Small Horses float in the parade.
No parade stream?
I'm not surprised, Buytoast.
>Inb4 it's somepony completely unexpected
>Like Cheerilee
Buytoast: They don't need a float, just a balloon. Like Rainbow Dash flying in a dynamic pose
It's Background Pony #56
"IT'S PIKACHU!"
I meant balloon.
its trixie
its lyra
maybe a few years from now, they'll have a Pinkie Pie balloon or something
Buytoast: I mean Hello Kitty got a balloon (When have they done anything with that lately?), why not MLP?
It's Spike! :D
Hello Kitty has a balloon?
it's Gojira!
Lambchop got a balloon - took 30 years to get there
Oh god Cypresswolf, we went through this before. Hasbro already made one but it came alive and they don't want to risk it wrecking New York
Hello
Lamb who?
:D
lali-ho Spamish
Salve, Spamish.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Lamb Chop was a puppet created & voiced Sherry Lewis - got her own show in th 90's, Sherry's latter years
huh, interesting
One time, I tried to sleep with my headphones on..
happy turdy day to you too StinkomanFan
But I know there's no MLp baloon, Hub and EqD would have said something
no ponies yet..
Deacon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2b4vUZ7wR4
When Sesame Street comes on, I bet Elmo won't be with them since Clash resigned the other day
DinkyDoo: I think if I tried to do that, I'd break them.
GIANT COOKIE MONSTER ATTACKING NEW YORK
Kammerjunk: I broke them. The sound became all.. fuzzy.. but I got new ones.
you think ponies will be on?
Looking for text message tones is hard. x
I remember the 90's shows, that's all I saw - wasnt until the internet int he later 90's did I find Sherry Lewis & Lambchop has been around MUCH longer
x.x*
StinkomanFan: just eat them
Google Cookie Monster real quick Spamish
whoops
it's a good thing I didn't put my password
Oh crap :S yeah
OR Grover
Everypony loves Grover
bishes don't know 'bout Super Grover
"There's A Monster at the End of this Book" is a literary classic
bah
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book:_Starring_Lovable,_Furry_Old_Grover BOOM, pity it spoils the ending though...
Wonder if there will be an MLP float...anypony know?
...take that as a no then?
idk
i hope there is!
macy parade
it'd be funny to see
thats what i watching
I'd laugh my ass off if it's an obscure pony
Like Soarin
or applejack?
>.>
or lyra
It's Fleetfoot!
Lyra with a huge smile on her face
Inb4 Spike float
A Big MAc float would make ALL the ladies swoon
ALL OF THEM, regardless of whether they're watching the parade or not
big mac float sounds too redneck :)
Sylandest: Not sure, Hub would have announced it
announced what
If there was a MLP balloon I think they would have mentioned it so we could look out for it
StinkomanFan: pretty sure they did
Yo what's up?
Only AFTER it happened
whats up scoots
yo scootsa
StinkomanFan: isn't that usually how it works
StinkomanFan, you wanna see a spoiler title?
http://www.kongregate.com/games/Mazapan/you-have-to-burn-the-rope
Scoot-Scootaloo, we wanna see the thanksgiving day parade
Don't we all~
i want to see the parade
am i the only one who doesn't care about the parade?
Anyway, just came to say that I hope y'all have an MLG Thanksgiving... if you celebrate it :P
cowvarkian: nope, you arent :)
If you don't, have an MLG day!
happy thanksgiving, Scoot-Scootaloo
i want a dashie parade balloon
no ponies yet :<
OOHHHHH you want ponies?
every year its pretty much the same
Ryunosuke: ikr
Knowing full well what it'll bring, I vote for ponies.
In the parade Scoots
Oh. Aww.
hey, want an opinion, should I keep this moxie scraggy with dragon dance and brave nature, or should I just go for a jolly one?
:D
ids there a stream or no?
Anyway, see y'all tomorrow!
seeya scoots
1) watch balloons. 2) eat lots of turkey 3) fall asleep for the rest of the afternoon while watching football 4) uhhh muffins? 5) profit :)
muffins!
GTG
i like that list
see u scoots
<.<
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353596421989.gif behold the ultimate technique
ponies megaforce!
Oh come on the Power Rangers still get balloons too, MLP ought to be in there
inb4 its gen 3.5 mlp
or even 3.6
dont say that D:
derpy should be in the parade!
I'd laugh if a Newborn Cuties balloon was in the parade.
If they put a balloon of MLP in the parade, the most likely candidate would be Twilight. She's kinda had the most visibility out there for the show, no? Most direct association, I mean.
dash is more famous
xD
Within the community itself, I suppose Dashie's the most popular choice of favourite pony, but Twiley definitely have more screen time.
has*
oh lawd Power Rangers in the macy parade
which power ranger did they go with?
There was a Power Rangers float?
J_E_Smith71: True, true...but they'd be looking for publicity. And who has been out there the most?
Sylandest: The new one, but since is the anniversary they had the recent one and a bunch of old ones
^
guys and maybe girls dancing
in power ranger suits
I think in the new Power Rangers show the new team has the power to change into the old Rangers
this is why I don't watch the parade thing
pikachu ears D:
they deflated..
aww
love how the commentaters ignore it
taters
lelel
whyy i would be like you noobs his ears deflated
they not suppose to be deflated
oh hey tmnt
TMNT floAT
i would love to be in a zelda float.. or the mlp fim float
Uh I'd rather MLP be just a balloon if it were a float they'd have to use the G4 live show suits....
and that's a bad thng
?
oh god not them creepy ones
morning everyponies
so how is everyone enjoying Day1 of Steam sale
mornin Zamer
would love to be a derpy ballon handler :>
Zamer: Didn't even notice it.
hi Zamer

2hours left before day 2 starts lol
oh god, dead island is on sale
there's a lot more but they're all hidden
I am going to buy the hay out of Train Simulator.
lol
i bought Half Minute Hero
and Costume quest
money well spent for HMH
how is dungeon defenders, anyone know?
not ponies >.>
I have and it's fun
planetside 2 is still terrible
Alchemist: not really
and they do have ponies on sale aniderp
Okay if the friggin ZuZu Pets get a flot MLP should
Alchemist: I've been trying to play the game since it came out.
http://store.steampowered.com/app/45100/?snr=1_7_suggest__13
oh talking about the Macy's parad
Bronysith: lagging out and maintaining 10 fps at 1024*768... no thanks.
I'm only just now actually starting PS2.
J_E_Smith71: you forget the companies pay to be in the parade
have they showed the Goseigers/Power Rangers Megaforce yet
Alchemist: well thats just you
not the games fault
Bronysith: yes, thats why I said its terrible.
and wait zuzu pets had a float?
a game where you can breed magical horses?
Alchemist: terrible for you, it is not the games fault at all, just your shit connection
Bronysith: oh for gods sake, cant I fucking say its terrible?
your reasonings behind it being terrible is bullshit
hi eveypony
Deacon it's one of the best games ever made
lali-ho something
Alchemist: you cant say that the game is terrible, get a better computer, conneciton and stuff and you would like it
Bronysith: no, you are putting something behind it what is not there.
SpeccyRush: Then Hasbro sucks for not putting in money for a MLP balloon
Alchemist: thats like saying skyrim sucks due to the horrible glitches
or the Walking Dead sucks because of it's save bug
hey wrek u baned me for 2 weeks good i was on a ship
I can't play a Bethesda game if it isn't glitchy.
It just doesn't feel right.
i rather the money from the ballon go to more ponies
Kammerjunk: it isnt a bethesda game if it isnt glitchy
if it isn't glitchy it isn't Bethesda
Bronysith: please read back and point it out where did I say ANYTHING you ASSUMED I said. Please.
damn Bronysith ninja'd
Alchemist: you said it is terrible because you lag and glitch out
It'll be great when the PS2 hype has died down and I can start the bloody thing.
Bronysith: so?
That doesnt make it terrible, that makes your connection shit
your connection being shit is no reason to say a game is terrible
is ajisawome on
FUCK CLOWNS
NOT THEM
That would be like saying TF2 is bad cause you cant get a good connection
Bronysith: when I play a football game and I get my ass kicked because my leg hurts and someone asks how was it I say it was terrible and they fucking know what I mean.
why is my sceer no work fuuu
Bronysith: stop putting words in my mouth please.
Hahaha what.
I start up PS2 and immediately see "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
Alchemist: you said that the game sucks because you cant get a good connection, stop blaming the game for your own shitty connection
Bronysith: what dont you get? I just got off PS2 and say it is still terrible. I had a bad experoience playing it. Please fucking allow me to say it was terrible without putting words in my mouth.
Kammerjunk: it's to test fonts
apparently
Hey everyone! :)
hey
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Crystal Empire DVD Already Invading Target
allo RaveBrony
cowvarkian: I know, but it's not exactly supposed to be there. I can't choose a faction either.
Alchemist: you said it was terrible due to your connection and 10 FPS, dont judge a game entirely because of your shitty computer
Kammerjunk: ah, well that's strange
I... What did I just watch?... ...
Bronys0of my god, no matter why it was terrible, it was terrible, if you dont get this, just stop now, we are not gwtting anywhere.
Well, I'm judging the game based on me not being able to choose an empire.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXasCjUTNpE --- What... What did I just watch?... (Warning, some dirty material.)
Guess I'm playing Terran.
O_o
I've had the game since it was in beta, but I've only played it twice
Hi
hey
lali-ho CCCP
but for the person asking about dungeon defenders its a great game and you dont need the dlc
Hi Deacon!
well unless you want to play with friends then you would
not ponies :<
Well, I guess I'll play PS2 when I can bother finding out how to fix it.
Is there a stream?
Planetside 2 is a pretty good game, pretty good for the new MMO FPS genre, you actually feel like you are one person in an entire army, it is awesome
the buffer is streaming
Meh, I didnt really like PS2, but I can stand playing it.
i wonder how Primal Carnage is
can you imagine if one day
the entire airforce and tanks and ground troops, my god it is like an awesome version of BF3
just to screw with us
a mod actually streamed the buffer wheel
My favourite game on PS2 is Robot Wars Arena of Destruction
but going the other way
Next to Simpsons hit and run
Lol!!
Chrysalis: I'm sure it will happen, if it hasn't already
Chrysalis: I wonder how long it would take for people to notice.
My fave game is both kingdom hearts games.
D<
I loved kingdom hearts so very much...
Kammerjunk people would probably notice VERY quickly, but owuldnt be able to say what was different
Chrysalis: I could tell. Since the play button would be a pause button
so do I Pokecolt ;)
KH wasnt bad
Tx State struuters are hot
did like the gameplay in II, but that's when things got complicated in the story
or, just plain cliche
complicated story is good
can't stand how one-dimensional most media is now
i prefer games that take a modicum of intelligence to play
Briefcase Drill Team? What?
...did you guys just see that?
FFT, Civ series, EVE online, PS2 (even though my teammates dont have any intelligence) :)
Gary's Mod 75% off
EVE Online is a fairly entertaining game.
Zamer: Really??
And with entertaining, I mean that I get so much reading done while mining.
tea
yes
CS:S + Gary Mod: $7
hm
Is there anything streaming?
CCCP: not at this moment, no
CCCP: Nope
the buffer

08,01did you know that 3/G is so battery hungry, not because of a higher power signal, but because the amount of processing needed for its complex compression and error correction algorithms is so high
Ish!

:I
/me got a Animal Crossing Watch today
an*
/me tells stomach he better suck it up, being upset wont help
THere is quite alot of /me in here today, haha
/me likes /me
/me licks Socks...
Use it too much and it could be dangerous
/me tears a hole in DoctoDoctorWho's stomach and heads for the appendix
like getting banned
it could happen
Yep
it happened to me
Yep yep, not like I even care anymore.
cowvarkian: Do tell *grabs popcorn*
:D
Dat dari
people were using /me too much, wrek threatened, I used it, got a 24 hour ban, and it lasted for 3 days
Dayum cowvarkian
Happy Thanksgiving folks: http://www.homestarrunner.com/turkey.html
cowvarkian: How the...
But that's why you don't do such things at all and ESPECIALLY around wrek
24 hour ban... for 3 days
24 hours = 3 days, da what?
that sounds like a 72 hour ban to me...
it was a 24 hour ban
it just didn't lift
then how did it last for 3 days...
aha
I c
Why put the functionality into the system if you don't want people to use it? <--(knows nothing about IRC)
Bans don't lat for fixed times, they're all permanent on IRC
last*
Ah
To make them timed you have to either manually remove it, or set a timer to remove it for you
so they have to be removed manually
So a 24h ban is just a ban that we remove about 24 hours
and apparently you all forgot
9:15 is me http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0JME7eodTk
Well I leave it to the person who made the ban to unban.
But /me, it's not like sn emoticon or colours, it just changes what you write to italic.
*an
I know
/me appears in purple in mIRC
No shit >_>
:D
>implying mIRC is for mods specifically
mIRC is pretty good.
know your IRCclients people
Am I wrong on that count? Oh :( Socks does bad internets
>actually using a shitty web client
Lel
Socks does real bad internets.
As I say I know nothing about IRC, this is my first one :P
I use Hydrairc
but cant you change the color and stuff in the settings??
But surely the rules of Bronystate should be based around the standerd IRC that it uses not other clients. (Could be talking crap here, don't know)
I use mIRC on Windows and XChat on Ubuntu.
There is no standard IRC client though
Well, IRC is just that - Internet Relay Chat.
I think socks means the web client
*standard
The roleplay rule doesn't have anything to do with the the colour of /me anyway
It's just because we aren't a roleplay room.
the /meing died down quite a lot...
If people want to RP they can go do it in an RP room
Indeed
Everyday I'm RPin'
Lol
I used to RP like you.
But then my D&D team just kinda fell apart.
Socks: He did it after Wrek warned everyone to stop.
Which is a bad move.
I JUST DONT FUCKING CARE!
Kammerjunk: I wish I had ppl to D&D with
DoctoDoctorWho: Then why are you here?
dabi, I knew what I was doing
Sorry if I'm being irritating I just want to know where I stand :P
its just slightly ridiculous why I was banned
You stand on thin ice at all times.
I was banned for a minute a couple of weeks ago.
Ello there everybrony.
Doing anything after Wrek says to stop is bad for your health
but beware, it might just break...
/me sacrifices Malavolent to the mods
cowvarkian: you were banned for a legit reason, just accept that you were banned and get over it
I am your virgin, hand me your gods!
Bronysith: I have geeze ._.
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice appears under your feet.
cowvarkian: your bitching says otherwise
Bronysith: cool story
i guess no ponies this year :<
Splendidus narratio, frater.
/me wants SuperBrony64|Zzz to wake up...
And not one shit was given.
Kammerjunk: indeed
Malavolent: We want to DoctoDoctorWho as a sacrifice
CCCP: /me isn't outlawed, but excessive use and RPing is
Well, knock yourself out.
or get...
The most dilligent of your followers, a SACRIFICE?
Okay
sacrifice me
DoctoDoctorWho: Hey, gods love diligent people. I hear they taste kind of like beef.
Of all the STUPID!
ASANI!
And not just any beef. That special kind of beef you can only get from the backs of well-fed cows.
/me becomes a super saiyan
I'm just Saiyan', that's what I heard.
/me could care less about saiyans...
I couldn't.
bye everyone
Have fun, aniderp.
Bai aniderp
will be on when im at home
Bye aniderp :)
That's a silly saying, really. "I could care less."
have good thanksgiving everyone
I'll be eating some nice lasagna tonight.
Back from an unsaid BRB, I was eating a sandwhich in slow motion.
/me Is literally twitching with rage
DinkyDoo: Did awesome music play in the background?
Kammerjunk: Yes c:
Neat.
DoctoDoctorWho: You know, you should see a doctor.
/me Crashes into the chat
It's not healthy.
oh hi, Ponies47.
Did I miss anything while I was eating my awesome sandwhich?
Yep
DoctoDoctorWho: what did you dad do now?
Malavolent: Come now, dari never sleeps.
Hai again Ponies47 :p
Is DoctoDoctorWho mad or something..?
Kammerjunk: I dont usually get like this, its just that Im so agitated, because people hardly ever respond! When they do, we're already at this! Do you know what its like to be dilligently ignored?
I do care a slight bit about saiyans
I could do
If I can be bothered to stream
Which is never.
Lazy pom
Sorry DoctoDoctorWho
I heard Jmo want to sacrifice himself.
hey guys

Naughtymare, oh, okay. Sorry

allo AJfan77

how are things AJfan77
Hi everypony.
Hai DinkyDoo
lali-ho DinkyDoo
Brohoof DinkyDoo /]
/me LOoks at stream
Oh look a stream ^_^
/me Brohoofs AJfan77
how are things DinkyDoo
Would Indie Game: The Movie count as an A Movie or a B Movie? It's 8.0 on IMDB
how much is it's budget?
<_< Seems Legit >_>
Budget:
$CAD100,000 (estimated)
hmm, I think it would be B
but that's just me
Sounds B to me Kandarihu, I'll take a look in a minute
I kind of thought it would be interesting if people start voting for it ONLY when it's Discounted on Steam
What is this music
Raubtier?
I think.
They are some angry ass motherfuckers. But they're pretty good.
Yeah, it sounds like them :3
If it's B, then I can't vote for it. I have something else I'm desperately trying to get as a B Movie.
^^
*^^^
Ah, you like them too, MLP_Brovakiin?
LadyCanary: Yeah I only like them as Wrek introduced me into them on the stream a while back :P
It sounds like a russian having a siezure. No offence to Russians who find this very not funny joke offensive.
/me zaps AJfan77 with a car battery
Ah same here, MLP_Brovakiin XD
:D
Im pretty open to music.
Metal especially.
What music playing now?
We'll probably do something, but I don't think anything is currently planned
LadyCanary: I usually get questioned about them when I listen to them in school though :S damn kids these days and their dubstep or what ever crap everyone listens to nowadays :P
Just like what you like.
Dubstep, blegh
I stopped caring what people think about my music taste a long time ago.
People don't respect music like they did back in the day.
the same could be said back in the day
it's been said every generation anyways
[22:20:17] <AJfan77> It sounds like a russian having a What music playing now?
LadyCanary: My friends always laugh at the fact I watch MLP and listen to heavy metal, kinda a big contrast there :P
But I also like Sara Barielles, Vocaloid music, Kate Nash, Etta James.
sup guys...oh god heavymetal.... ughhhh
Leonid : a siezure is when you lie on the floor, stop breathing and have a spaz attack
MLP_Brovakiin: Like I said, you like what you like. It's what makes people unique and interesting.
Yeah true :)
Ah Wreky is wearing the invisible cloak <3
MLP_Brovakiin: i like rock just i hate metal heavy metal and death metal if there even is a difference
MLP_Brovakiin: this right now is fine and good just the las song was ughhh ear rape
AJfan77, what it das mean?
Also, I HEAR NIGHTWISH (I think)
LadyCanary: what genre
R.I.P. Headphone users
05soudns like someone needs more sabaton
hai guys
:3
Ohai Wreky <3
ollo SpadeMagnes[R
hey LadyCanary
Wrek: Yes please :3
The king of Dubstep is Scrillex
and wrek
Hai SpadeMagnes[R :)
Wrek: GAAAY division :3
I think I played too much Halo because I automaticly thought that was a mongoose
LadyCanary: id rather pass... i hate any kind of metal it just sound like a cluster fuck of instruments and notes and people just screaming. its just my opinion so all the power to you i just cant stand it
slow day for streaming
SpadeMagnes[R: Yeah, I am on that now :P
spitfirecolt well it is thankgiving
I can never understand metal
It just seems like a bunch of screaming
It's an acquired taste, SpadeMagnes[R.
But thats just me I suppose
Rain!
It depends on the artist, really.
I'm muting this and playing Sonic music or something
05i liek this song jsut for its guitar
05but proper metal is queued after
I'm thankful for the fact that My Little Pony friendship is magic is still on the air
Last season and this season is short tho
LadyCanary: ya the only ones i like is the nazi zombies sountrack because they actually sing some times and the guitar isnt just smashing and banging it actually has a good cathcy rythm that you can remember of the top of your head. i still do hate the screaming parts in them though
last contracted season
they may make another season or two if contracts are renegotiated
Do you guys think this place will hold regardless if MLP ends or not?
But to be fair, a lot of metal bands use the loud random banging, but somehow it works.
I want some pony!
:L
Leonid: Go to youtube then.
^
Ryunosuke: wait what mlp is ending
^^
Okay :P
I mean are we still gonna hang around here after it ends? I would like to think so
05of*
Leonid for the love of everything you hold dear, do NOT request ponies on bronystate
SpadeMagnes[R : more than likely because the episodes are still on youtube
SABATOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
05now here you got some proper metal
I dont like metal but I dont say I hate all of it, I just find it my thing
/me nuzzles Wreky. Thank you, hun <3
Wrek: i have no idea wha a condemign is
*dont
/me also loves sabaton <3 :3
I tend to respect people tastes
Unless its garbage....but anyway
the internet doesn't respect other peoples tastes
Opinions on the internet? HAH!
BLASTPHOMY
AJfan77, internet = society
Also Im kinda sad now
My parents said we would have my birthday party today but they forgot to get me a cake
is it just me or is the sound quality of this track a bit rough?
SpadeMagnes[R: When is it your birthday?
Yeah
It was last saturday
It does sound a bit fuzzy.
I'm listening to Sonic 1's green hill zone because i dont like the music playing
My parents were both workign so we were going to have it today
Oh, happy birthday for last sunfay SpadeMagnes[R :p
*sunday
AJfan77, he has better metal on now
What defines metal?
Its meh
im a brony i love and tolerate im pretty sure i repect everyones opinions unless they are completely biased and dont agree to facts. for example if someone says that COD is the best game ever i will give my opinion on it and tell them what i think. but if someone says Sonic 06 is the best sonic game or even a good game.... then love tolerance be damned i will call them idiots ecause they cant see truth
First came hard rock, which was like Zeppelin.
Then metal moved in.
Sonic 06 can be a so bad its good game sometimes
The ammount of glitches can be hilarious sometimes
Ok i was kicked when i sed i didnt like the music and i did mute it so whoever just kiked me out i did wat u told me to do
Still say the best glitch is Sonic getting shot to the moon
:D
TO THE MOOOOOOOOON
SpadeMagnes[R: at times for the funny glitches but when you get stuck on walls and get to the ball puzle and silver boss fights.... then no it cant
05no, you're still complainin'
mine as well
Ah, Sonic 06. So bad its good
Weh weh weh weh
Hai AJIsAwesome :3
Also once you get the white gem and purple gem you won the game
Hi, MLP_Brovakiin. :)
You can pretty much break the game further with those
Hi agree with u sir
YESSSSSSSS
THIS SONG <3
gnah, I'm in the join queue of woodman :/
GOTT MIT UNS
Every time I see wooman I keep thinking of Megaman 2
*woodman
Par's bass in this song is just exceptional <3
Megaman 2 was an awesome game
I still find it hilarious you can skip Silvers ball puzzle
^
SpadeMagnes[R: i can understand when people say its so bad its good(even if i think its ASSHOLE INCARNATE NO MATTER WHAT.) but when someone says its a actual GOOD game then no... just... no and hell this is coming from the guy whose favorite sonic game is unleashed, i even like he werehog (stages not the concept)
Buck the ball puzzle
It's an awesome, but overrated game IMO.
Some people still say the game would have sucked even if it wasnt rushed
I like Sonic 06 because you just find so many glitches that its fun like the gems or skipping Silvers ball puzzle
Some of the gems are usless really
like the green and yellow gems
Unleashed was originally going to have Knuckles handle the combat sections, but he was scrapped due to time constraints IIRC.
Wait for reals?
White gem and purple gem
Especially the greeen game.
*green gem
Knuckles was supposed to be in unleashed?
Huh...
SpadeMagnes[R: ya the glitches were prob because it was rushed but poor level design and ust terrible gameplay ideas have no excuse
So how about the classics
AJIsAwesome: ya how much you wanna bet if it was knuckles instead of the werehog people would love the game
Im kind of glad they have Eggman/Robotnik the main bad guy again
^
I kind of got tired of Robotnik being hijacked by some monster
Sonic 2 is my fav game of all time.
^still mine
I don't have a favorite Sonic game.
DKC SERIES all the way, and PLOK
Sonic 3 and Knuckles best game of all time
SpadeMagnes[R: i know right. i mean i did like chaos and perfect dark gaia. but im glad that eggmans the final boss even if he does use a divine monster but ass long as hs controlling it in the final boss then thats fine
I love Sonic 3 & Knuckles but i thought there were some moments where the game just wasn't fun anymore
Like the entire lava reef
sonic is terrible
Lava reef had a nice soundtrack though
sabaton - panzerkampf, PLEASE! >_>
mmhmm
Well were in a conversation about him so yeah
Leonid: <333333
I didn't really like Sandopolis. Probably because I kept timing out.
LadyCanary: you ever heard of mastadon?
SpadeMagnes[R: and yes technically thats the best sonic game of all time as it does everything a sonic game shoud do but best game no.. prob zelda or something... but ven though i admit its the best sonic game i still have more fun with unleashed
....
Sith.
Really?
Even though I like shadow, I think he might have stayed dead, or kept the ambiguous idea, is he a robot or real?
But I still like the music of Sandopolis.
I never liked the whole alien bullshit
Carnival Night act 2 was the only time i got a time over
The fucking barrel
Bronysith: I do, dont like em too much.
LadyCanary: i can get that, was just asking cause they are from my hometown >.>
AJfan77 how about that barrel of doom?
SpadeMagnes[R: shut up it wasnt that bad. although i will admit it was kinda dickish
Its not bad once you figure it out but its kind of ambiguous to press up and down
Play Konungens Likfärd whenever you can Wrek. If that's okay with you ^^"
Hey guys!
hai SafariMonkey
Hi, SafariMonkey. :)
I didn't know what to do when i got to the barrel then i remembered sonic shorts because it was only a while back i got to play Sonic 3 & K
god why am i watching animaniacs still
So I'm gonna play PS2 but I need to be added to skype then, please? :)
SpadeMagnes[R: ya especially since all the other barrels responded to gravity and weight instead of button input. it does throw you abit off guard
The one thing I will never understand in Sonic is how you go from the Biolizard to Shadow
It's amazing how the fandom is still around after so many failed installments of the franchise over the years
And my only decent mouse (an MS wireless) has had all its contacts corroded out by battery fluid
Looks at Sonic Genisis GBA
SuperBrony64|Zzz: wake up...
Kandarihu: one of the reasons it is one of the worst game fandoms ever
the 15 aniversarry was not a good year for sonic
^
EVERYONE WELCOME TO BRONYSTATE WHERE ASIDE FROM THE NAME, NO ONE TALKS ABOUT MLP OR PONIES
Bronysith: so, sticking around, no matter what, = horrible fans?
INSTEAD WE TALK ABOUT SONIC AND BAD GAMES
what do you expect from adults... who talks about mlp...
I stick with stuff like Sonic because I feel like it will eventually get better
SpadeMagnes[R: we can only hope
I mean hey Sonic Colors and Generations were good
SpadeMagnes[R : Sonic 06 was ok. Sonic Genisis GBA is the worst game i ever played. and Sonic riders was ok
^^
I enjoyed Colors and Generations.
no im joking ive been on here for about a month. its just cause everyones talking abou everything completely unrelated today
*Colors/Coulors
Sonic Generations 3DS has a FANTASTIC soundtrack
Bronysith: What happened to respecting others?
AJIsAwesome: you do remember its Bronysith right
AJIsAwesome: newfoals and newbs are an exception
Indeed. Most of the Sonic games since the end of the classic era has it's fans, even Sonic 06.
AJIsAwesome : Welcome to the internet
cowvarkian: You do remember we have rules, right?
AJIsAwesome: also,... >on the internet. >taking people seriously
It's just been a broken base
I still will never understand what the Biolizard was for, and the jump from that to Shadow
AJIsAwesome: from what I remember, yes
AJIsAwesome: i liked unleashed colors and generations a lot but i still dont see what the hype is for sonic colors its good just overrated. i mean ya you get only sonic and supersonic but till sonic unleashed had too much speed i find colors has too much platforming
SpadeMagnes[R, uh... um... hmm... ...... ULTIMATE LIFE FORM!
SpadeMagnes[R maybe gerald thought, it was more convient
hi
bye
Isnt it confirmed that Shadow was based on Super Sonic?
and guys i know it was a joke i like mlp about as much as all of you
Carolus Rex awww YISSSS
Bronysith: ikr hahaha lol
SpadeMagnes[R it was kinda implied since it's been known that gerald studied the mural in hidden palace zone
But god damn I hate the Artificial Chaos in SA2
^
SpadeMagnes[R No it wasn't but the design was
poor beethoven
And I turn away for lunch and we have a Sonic discussion
0,5Ew gey
They would always mess up your Ring Count, ridding you of the chance of getting an A rank.
Ew Bacon. :3
Happy Turkey Day AJIsAwesome
SpadeMagnes[R: no its a fan theory a goood one actually. they say gerald robotnick say a mural of super sonic and one of perfect chaos and based shadow off of supersonic and biolizard off of perfect chaos
Happy Turkey Day to you too, J_E_Smith71. :)
Besides
Mario>sonic
Mario=Sonic.
Sonic 2's slicers are MUCH WORSE THAN ARTIFICIAL CHAOS
FUCKING SLICERS
I
FUCKING SLICEEEERRRRSSSS
HATE
SLICERS
Chill.
0,5this vrsion of sonic s so mch bettr than the other lik 10 vrsons cuz dis one is magcl and chaotic nd stuff
somecallmejohnny FTW
BaconMane: ikr
Breakdancing eggmaaaaaan
nothing is more amusing than sonic fans
*Cue various explosions*
YOU GOT THE REFERANCE yay :(
At least with the Slicers, you either have Super Sonic at that point.
Bronysith: You may be right.
SpadeMagnes[R: oh my someone has to make a fan hack call sonic 3cd and knuckles and knuckles
But trying to stay at 50 rings is the problem
people trying to defend such a bad franchise, it is hilarious
Sith, dont try to create drama.
^
So do Sonic Colors and Generations mean nothing to you?
LadyCanary: but he does it so well
Seriously. As stupid as you may think it is, some people still like it.
The chaos emeralds in that game are the hardest in series and i never madie it passed CE #4
Let's keep Bronystate classy, please.
0,5IM NT SONIC
0,5IM MY ORIGNAL CHARACTER
0,5BLONIC
ronic
Elsie xD
Fuck Sonic Advance 2 special stages
Sanic
Sonic & All Stars Racing is pretty fun
BaconMane: THESE NEW POPCORN NUGGETS ARE POPALICIOUS!
/me rap music playing in the distance
Bronysith: sonic is amazing. still i can understand why you think that because of shadot the hedgehog sonic 06 and the rest of the games in his dark age. but before and after that the games were fun as hell
0,5wat?
AJIsAwesome: Dont you mean papanutricious?
SpadeMagnes[R actualy they're quite easy, but the requirement, yea...
SpadeMagnes[R: Indeed and the stpid SP Rings which you lose if you die so you have to go through the whole stage on one life
BaconMane: You didn't see that video he did of Sonic (the restaurant), did you?
SpadeMagnes[R: NO!
Hello everypony can you see my message through this ipad?
0,5nuh uh
SpadeMagnes[R: the special stages are fine. just getting to them...UGHH
0,5Dont want to
lali-ho PonyStationVita
I still love Cream can cheese Sonic Advance 2's final boss
BaconMane: That's what I was referencing.
0,5THESE CRYSTALS R POWRFUL
so we talk about sonic
I made a joke too I just saw that
PonyStationVita: apparently we do
Sonic 4 is an insult to the classics but Epispde 2 was a masterpiece
PonyStationVita: yup your good
Cheese the boss fight...
So how can I get added to the bronystate 'clan' for PlanetSide 2?
sonic 4 2 was good actually
AJfan77 it wasn't that bad, just differnet
Oh god Sonic 4 ep 1''s physics
AJfan77: i know right i still dont know why people hate sonic 4 ep 2. ya i understand there arguments but i still love it
tails made the diffrence
Sonic games that bore me: Sonic Rivals 1 (sequel was more fun), Sonic Battle, parts of Sonic '06
I don't mind Sonic 4 Ep. 2. But do I find it Sonic 4? Not really. But it's a good game by itself.
You know whats a good Sonic game? Sonic Before The Sequel
Deacon Not as bad as sonic genisis GBA but the physics dont exist
Its a fucking amazing fangame
the partner system made the game a bit too broken though
Three favorite games: S3&K, SA 1, Generations
I actually had a great time with Sonic Battle. :$
SpadeMagnes[R: ya it was. is after the sequel out yet
inmmy opion colrs was my favorite plz no hate
You know whats a good sonic game? Any of the original 2d ones.
I love Sonic 2 with all my heart and will defend it to any extent
AJIsAwesome: CANT WAIT
Shadow the hedgehog was eh
you know wha speaking of fan games WHEN THE HELL IS FIGHTING IS MAGIC COMING OUT
i think every 1 can agree sonic 06 was shit
I CANT WAT
So how bout Sonic 4 Episode 3 do u guys think it should happen
PonyStationVita: dont even FUCKING remind me
The ending for Sonic 4 Ep2 sucked though
i want knuckes on ep 3
It was such a letdown
AJfan77: Since Little Planet is still stuck inside the Death Egg, yes.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: The Strings That Make no Sound
wow viewing on ipad is actually good
Maybe not, because unlike Ep 1 there is no To be continued screen
There is one unused in the coding though
Sonic is my favorite video game franchise evr
AJfan77: i hope but you konw the fans. i just hope dimps listens to wha the fans say. ya they fixed the physics but still is it realy neccissary to have so many springs and speed boosterd
AJIsAwesome: Until it comes out I just play Sonic The Fighters after that and pretend the Death Egg blows up there
Dimps loves their pits
And their speed boosters.
Sonic 06 loves speed boosters
You how stupid the sonic fandom can be sometimes?
O god notthe speed boasters
sonic advance 3 was when dimps started becoming... well... DIMPS
Oh, and don't forget the automated sections too.
When Sky sanctuary came out in generations
SpadeMagnes[R as stupid as the brony fandom?
SpadeMagnes[R: IT'S NOT YELLOW ENOUGH!
Sonic Retro whined it wasnt YELLOW enough
THE FUCK
SpadeMagnes[R: I know, right. :S
SpadeMagnes[R: i know seriously sonic sucks because of his eye color.......WTF
Hello all.
lali-ho Jageman
Hi, Jageman. :)
sega better make a sonic game on wiiu or a better version on3ds
GREEN EYES RUINED FOREVER
It's just an eye color, sheesh. :S
AJfan77: CLEMEN FUCK THE WORLD
Also for once I enjoyed Crisis City, I fucking love Modern Crisis city
^
sonic generation on 3ds was meh
Tails cat swim underwater RUINED FOREVER
Anyone else here having a bad day?
I still love that one glitch I discovered in Classic Seaside hill
everything alright Jageman?
Jageman what happened
AJIsAwesome: I've seen other people complain about Sonic's modern design completly not just the eyes
SpadeMagnes[R: ikr and people say its glithy as hell like sonic 06..... seriously no its not
Guess what the glitch did?
sonic generation on 3ds has ton of glitches
0,5We still talkin about blonic
0,5jeez
J_E_Smith71: I know that, but I just don't know why people complain about the eyes of all things.
I bounced over a wall with the bubble shield and a part of the level didnt load
SpadesMagnea[R wat glitch
Schedual conflict, i will not be going to the family Thanksgiving party today.
BaconMane: "Yes, yes!" -M. Bison
aww man Jageman, that's awful
Theres this one wall in Classic Seaside hill, if you bounce over it with the bubble shield, the next section of the level doesnt load
but in my opioon sonic generation 3ds>sonic 06
AJIsAwesome: I've seen people complain about the eyes because"His pupil is too small!"
The coding is still there, just not the graphics
oh cool
J_E_Smith71: :D
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
sorry to hear that Jageman
FAVORITE SONG ON THIS ALBUM
YAAAAAAY
J_E_Smith71: i know honestly even though i grew up during sonics 3d games i in all honesty think modern sonic has the bst design. unleashed i think makes it look the best
yay
Also I love using Classic homing attack
It breaks all the level design
I'm wearing a classic sonic shirt right now
/me wants to cry, but tries to use logic to remind self that emotions are meaningless.
SpadeMagnes[R: Oh, I remember all the rage when people discovered that skill.
'06
i thought u can only domthat on 3ds version
Jageman: good job
....
PonyStationVita: It's a Red Ring reward in the HD version
/me facedesks
PonyStationVita: No in the 360/pc version you get it by getting all the red rings as classic sonic i think
0,5CRAAAAAWLING IN MY SKIIIN
What game is this?
ggo d dammitmi hav ps3
I need a distraction.
It makes playing as classic so fun
It really does. :D
Sonic in Sonic X only has 3 spines RUINED FOREVER :[
Also I think they make a joke about how Unleashed was boost to win
sonic and that 80s cartoon had 5
they did
They put in an ability that gives you infinite boost
But your a one hit wonder doing so
dniwe
and Sonic didnt exist in the 80's
sorry 90s
PINGAS
Seaside hill seems illplaced in Generations though
why does nobody like the vanu?
Gotta Go Fast, Gotta go Faster Faster Fasterfasterfaster! :p
god spnic x
snooPINGAS ussual I SEEEE
anyone remember Sonic SATAM
all iliked about it was tails kissing cosmo
i do
SpadeMagnes[R: Well they did need a Heroes stage, plus Modern Seaside Hill was a good stage
I'm surprised this discussion has lasted this long, and it seemed to liven up the chat
PonyStationVita: but but...what about shadow? D:
Yea but it didnt seem to fit in the dreamcast erra
lo the shadow fight are somthing else
Deacon: Well, you should've seen what it was like before.
AJIsAwesome: best sonic show ever... sonicx coming behind it
The adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog was my fav sonic cartoon ONLY fo RRRRRRRRobotnik
You are dumbots
SpadeMagnes[R: Well saying Dreamcast/GCN/PS2/XBox era was a mouthfull
i'm going to go watch some pony stuff. Ponies help me forget.
Later all.
hope you'll feel better Jageman
Bye Jageman
I actually like Chaos looks intimidating in Generations
Hope you feel better, Jageman. :)
He looked so retarded in SA1
any1 no that sonic moovie where metal sonic and sonic fight at the snow.
Brohoof, Jageman? /]
i miss the chao garden
You are all awesome.
[\
I loved the Chao Garden.
PonyStationVita ja, that would be the OVA
LOVED it.
It may be nostalgia talking but I fucking love City Escape
wonder if bronystate will accept ova for a b movie
probably
SpadeMagnes[R: the song the sa2 level or the generations song mix or the generations level
must be an hour long iirc
PonyStationVita: Only a hour so probably not
Both actually
awww
YOU MIGHT KNOW WHAT IM GOING TO DO BUT THATS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU BECAUSE I KNOW EVERYTHING YOUR GOING TO DO!!! STRANGE ISN'T IT! I had to do that
PonyStationVita: ova?

i love both songs and the generations level. i used to like the original level but idk it aged not so well just feels a bit to linear
I love the parody of the Sonic OVA
^
its so hilariou
WOOOOOOOOOOW my heads spinning
SpadeMagnes[R: Sonic Bastardized?
AJIsAwesome: Thats the one
Only one thing I've noticed though out Sonic is, regardless of the gameplay, I always fucking love the music
i agree

I mean to Sonic 06's credit it had a nice sound track
the game just sucked ass
Sonic Music is Awesomre
SpadeMagnes[R: i think im the only one that has an ipod which 3/4s of the music is sonic music. the rest being other video game music

ekips, becuz it's easier ^^
i saw the prome for it
Give those back!
Wrek: TRUE TRUE but i listened to metal and i hated it. you ever play a critically praised sonic game
Invi just download it from the original site and use your beta account
NOO~
Tom: Learn some grammar, it’s 1 day.
ekips, ah have none
Invi You were not in the beta? Oo
bad sounds like pinkie pies rock from pinkie of ehatever itscaled
ekips, nop
05i played sonix
05i HATED it
Woop
what is vienf streamed?
05you got to respect that
05as I have to respect your opinion in games
05so stop whining
Invi strange, then you have to go with Prosieben.Sat1 it seems :P
Wrek: which sonic game for all we know it could of been 06
Wrek: Which ones? The original Genesis ones?
ekips, but.. bäääh ^^
Wrek: I respect opinions, regarding they are valid complaints
I loled when there was a G3 pimkie pie referance
what is bieng streamed?
i liked the lyra refernce
It's fine if people don't like things. But please don't discourage the people who like it ( for everyone in general). :)
pony_4442: Planet side 2 :)
pony_4442: wrek playing some planetside
pony_4442: PLanetside 2.
Invi should've made a beta account, would've gotten a nice decal too :P
ty
No problem. :)
AJIsAwesome: i know but they have to play it before they can make a full opinion on it. its the same thing with brony haters
wow a pistol hmm
ekips, i didn't even know that game exsisted since yesterday ^^
Invi and 500 free station cash :P
But god damn I hated Big the Cat
Wrek: seriously which sonic games did you play
I think Sonic must have been the first videogame that I was hooked by the cartoons first
WHERE'S MY FROGGY?
My mind was blown when I found out Duke Nukem voiced Big
I was like what the fuck
SpadeMagnes[R: :D
big is also voiced by that guy from duke nukem
Invi wow, you missed a few streams haven't you? ^^
05im proving a point, stop beign uptight
i thought Big was ok i didnt mind him because he didnt have many lvls
13Wrek: copper
As a fishing mechanic, he's "okay". But does he have to be in a "Sonic" game?
Wrek: the ones that were just playing and i dont like it. now that i said that tell me which sonic games did you play
the fishing lvl froogy where r u
AJIsAwesome: ikr
They apperently made big because they wanted a character who didnt have to go fast all the time
That or to advertise sega bass fishing...
He can easily jump in the water and grab him
ekips, i saw that game here but uuuh *shrugs
^
i think colrs did a good job on jokes but a bad job on lack of variet on characters
He could also cage the frog so that he would never get away.
/me likes this song~
Invi ?
Who voiced Robotnik in the sonic cartoon?
Well Wrek I think he's asking because he's probably seeing if you only played the ones that everyone thinks sucks, or if you played the classic ones that are considered good (Like Sonic 3 & Knuckles which is the best in the series)? If you think the originals suck that's fine, but maybe they think you're judging it on the later games that sucked
ekips?
SpadeMagnes[R: Which ones?
yay
The Adventure of sonic the hedgehog one
Wrek: im not being stubborn i just want to know what sonic game you played cause if you played a bad one then you dont really have a good opinion till you play the good ones. if you played the good ones then i wont understand you but ill respect your opinion
happy thanksgiving everypony :)
05i dont know why he keeps askign as i told him i was provign a point
SpadeMagnes[R: Long John Bradly
Happy Thanksgiving, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)
Invi I meant: Please provide more detail concerning your last statement :P
Im not sure which robotnik it was but I remember one of this is the same voice actor for Pooh Bear
SpadeMagnes[R: :D
SpadeMagnes[R: SatAM it was Jim Cummings
SpadeMagnes[R: I hope that that's the AOSTH one. :D
Sabaton, Sabaton~
ekips, neither did i know what was played not that it was free and i also didn't care about it because i thought it was another expensive thingy gamy stuff ^^
AJIsAwesome: Nope it was SatAM
any 1 think the sonic racing game released a few days agonis a rip off of mario kart 7
*nore
*nor so
13http://i.imgur.com/R7VRT.gif forget turkey let's have some beef
J_E_Smith71: That's even better. :D
Wrek: look im gonna shut up but just play a good sonic game and then come back and tell me you dont like it and youll have a good opinion and statement
Invi that's why you always ask the holy question "What is on stream?"
D: Poor cow, Shizu
I never liked turkey.
PonyStationVita: Even so it has some really good track design
hmm true
ekips, well... meh ^^
Its kind of a stupid argument to say one racing game is a rip off of a nother one
Wrek: and play it with an open mind or your no better than a brony hater. k just try them
Mario kart double dash <3
all racing games seem similar to me
does any 1 have the mlp app for ipad i need scootaloo for hearts
I hated double dash
I loved Double Dash.
I always had to play with koopa to use triple shells
how many rainbow roads have there been
AJfan77: Depends. How many MK games have been made?
7
Anyways I got into Sonic when I saw the promotional comic for the first game. I wanted it but I already had a NES & SNES and my parents thought that was enough
according to mario kart 7
I never played super mario kart but I remember the AI being super dickish in that game
there was even one is Sonic R and one in FZero GX
I hope they're counting the MK GP ones.
SpadeMagnes[R: DOn't bother. That game's INCREDIBLY hard to win.
*Don't
hey if any one wants to friend me on the mlp app game on ipad type in my name and i will give you my gifts evryday.
Funny enough I never had Sonic 1 until the Mega Collection came out
^
anyone ever meet a brony hater in real life
You too AJIsAwesome?
On a entirely different topic, I fucking love reading Dwarf Fortress forum playthroughs
J_E_Smith71 same here the first few sonic games were before my time
I grew up with Sonic 2 (even though I can't remember it), and I played the Sonic 3+ Knuckles CD.
05I dont take kindly on you calling me a brony hater man, thats low.
<.< Oh jesus....
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353562264495.jpg
Wrek: He's talking specifically to you?
Sonic 3 CD & Knuckles & Knuckles
Wrek: i never did call you that
J_E_Smith71: Yep. :)
I LOVED Mega Collection.
05so by your logic i can tell you to lsiten to some proper metal and if you dont you are no better than a hater? tsk tsk
05just go sit in the corner and chew on something
Maybe we all need to calm down....
alexxm: Funny enough I was around when it came out but for some reason my parents never got it for me, even though it was released
Also on a entirely different topic, Disney is putting a starbucks in the Magic Kingdom
SpadeMagnes[R: Already one at DCA
SpadeMagnes[R: inb4 Disney themed drinks.
Pssst thats the que to calm down
J_E_Smith71 did you have the sega consle?
The problem I have with it is their replaceing the mainstreet bakery with the starbucks
I still have the Genesis controller, but not the console.
I loved the bakery
alexxm: Yep had a Genesis, had all the Sonic games except for Sonic 1
never owned a sega consloe
SpadeMagnes[R: Yeah would have been fine if they just added Starbucks drinks
Did megacolelction have Sonic 3 and K?
i want a Dreamcast
I was very close to buying Sonic 2 Genesis at a Blockbuster as a kid, but I didn't have a Genesis. :<
actually no i dont, i just appreciate what the dreamcast did
I remember when I rented a Dreamcast and SA with it.
13if you don't listen to bronze you are not a metal fan
I found it stupid Sonic's ultimate Genesis collection didnt have Sonic 3 and Knuckles
is nintendo why sega stppoed making consloes
They had a bullshit reason for it
No disc space
You know, when they would allow you to RENT CONSOLES.
god, all the 4th wall breaking in animaniacs
Then later they release the thing with Sonic 3 and Knuckles on it! as a special edition!
AJIsAwesome: lol reminds me of that video on YT where the guys sleeping and his phone rings,he pick up everything BUT the phone lol picks up a Genesis "Hello? F:[K!" then pick a banana does the same thing then a BUNDLE of bananas :D
Its one thing to not put shit in a game, but when you make up bullshit excuses its worse
I never got past Windy Valley as a kid.
genesis does what nindont any1 no that commercial
i do
i saw avgns paradody of it so funny
Super nintendo>gennesis
Super Nintendo=Genesis.
nin10doh
Nintendoes what geneisnt
:3
SNES was badass
cratorkid: I remeber that video series. :D
avgn was a nintendo defender and said sega sucked
BLAST PROCESSING!
Also what the hell is Blast Processing?
man they need to make game commercials like the ones from the 80's to 90's :D
And I'm back from swimming! :$
SpadeMagnes[R: It doesn't do anything, it's something they came up with to help with sales.
AJIsAwesome: :) think i will go watch that again once the stream ends :P
get thepower nintendo power
Welcome back, MadSurge. :)
PonyStationVita: Not really he did a Sonic video where he talked about his memories from playing the classic ones
The anime comercial for Black 2 White 2 should be a show
PonyStationVita: Not anymore
rip nintendo power
i know
hey MadSurge welcome back :) got your mane wet i see? :D
SpadeMagnes[R: A show where Ash finally isn't the main character anymore.
wasnt Phantasy star 4 on the gennesis?
i need to play that
Hi everypony and happy Tday!
how've you been MadSurge
Seriously the Anime trailer for Black 2 White 2 was fucking amazing
AJIsAwesome: lol i think Ash is a highlander or something :D
Sketch_Toku_Brony: and tired, yes :D
I mean, I like Ash and all but can they just shift to another main character?
hey Turkey_icybeauti
how are things Turkey_icybeauti
buffer
Hi, Turkey_icybeauti. :)
But ash sounds like he smokes....
phantasy star 4 was a great game
AJIsAwesome: Not to mention he's always going to lose
and yes genesis
Hi cratorkid AJIsAwesome and alexxm
pokemon is THE most repetative anime in theworld
Hai Turkey_icybeauti :D
Has ash ever won any championships?
helost vey final battle
Hello Turkey_icybeauti!
and MLP_Brovakiin
nope
and whoever else shall say hi to me...I'm too lazy to ping.
He won orange island which wasnt important
He could have been a fuckign Frontier Brain
Gen 1: Said he's going to catch all the pokemon in the world. Gen 5: Barely has enough to make a percentage.
what a yutz
He turned it down..the fuckwad
Turkey_icybeauti: how are you? :)
fine thx
SpadeMagnes[R: yeah have im win the one tourny that wasn't in the game
Also Pikachu losing to a newbie snivy was bullshit
SpadeMagnes[R: And that could've been the chance where they could've shifted to another character.
Well, in technical terms he didn't. He only does in the movies.
did anybody else read the creepy pasta about ash?
Pikachu has fought LEGENDARIES AND EVERYTHING
And he lost TO A FUCKING NEW SNIVY
i mean come on
The fuaq
Pikachu fights legendaries, can't beat 1st gym...:P
SpadeMagnes[R: Only time Ash can beat the Elite 4 is in the Pokemon Ash Grey hack
Red took down an entire terroist organization with his pokemon
sorru every 1 have to go if any1 wants to add me on mlp app for ipad do so so i can gift heatrs bye. illsee guys for movie night and season3.
and he was 10

Bronysith: i know, but he stil never ages, there is a creepy pasta on it, ill find in in a sec
MadSurge: exactly
he never ages because of Ho oh
Did stream die?
or whatever that pokemon is
LadyCanary: i guess so
Oh wait, nevermind. I know what happened.
LadyCanary: seems like iy
*t
I say the ppeople who made the Black 2 White 2 trailer should make the new pokemon anime
ash never ages because of Ho oh
Its much better than the one we have now
http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Ash's_Coma
^ why ash doesnt age
... the title spoils it all
slappy the squirrel <3
Also the first season of pokemon had so many errors
dang it y u post creepypasta during my 2:45 AM time in my place...
Hello Invi :)
hai MadSurge ^^
One episode had bulbasaur use fucking whirlwind
:D
valoreins|Work: >:D
SpadeMagnes[R: Don't forget the Jelly Filled Donuts!
SpadeMagnes[R, the game has also some errors
Even as a kid I could tell those things wer enot donuts
One last comment before I leave.
Gak
also you know what they edited a rice ball rolling down a hill into?
Invi: the whole Psychic class was bugged up the ass in Gen1 :D
This seems to be a great movie. I might vote for it in the next lottery :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2LUssy5lwA
MadSurge, and many more funny wunny bugs ^^
g :[ k
MadSurge, Missingno. ^^
Pin missile was the shit in gen one
Does that script still work?
05there we go
where we go?
05hmm
Invi: I'm glad that Gen 5 made all classes liable to get through the game with :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oER05_nm0B8
05maybe some...
Wasnt critical hits based by speed in gen one?
One of the most broken Pokemon in the game.
SpadeMagnes[R: That and some other factor, I think.
AJIsAwesome: not anymore :D
MadSurge, isn't gen5 that black/white stuff?
What's the bronystate squad in PS2?
Invi: yep
ah okay. can't talk about that since i never played it MadSurge ^^
Stat wise I find White Kyurem better than Black Kyurem
SafariMonkey NLP and actually go ingame and add wrek
Its move set is more special than physical base
SpadeMagnes[R: Well, Reshiram has always been more useful than Zekrom.
SafariMonkey If you can do that wrek can invite you to the outfit
Invi: they made bugs cool and you can't import nor catch old gen mons until you're done with the story :)
What's wrek's name? is it wrek?
The kyurem fusion has a lack of physical moves which Black kyurem can use
But its loaded with special ones
I still wish Electric move's power was boosted in the rain.
I still cant get over how less animated White Kyurem looks compared to Black
That way it could compete with Fire +Sunny Day.
05my computer is still a bit unstable
05but its better than yesterday
Take your time, Wrek. :)
05good to see the cleaning helped
^^
Wrek: Can you add me on PS2?
its wrek
05jsut add Wrek and ill sort it the next time i log on
Wrek: is it going to become self aware soon?
05as for now
inb4 Skynet.
bitch please
AM is much worse than Skynet
6 on 6 wailord battle
05right now im contemplating streaming somethign different
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW
SpadeMagnes[R: :D
MadSurge, they made bugs cool? i found them always cool ^^
6 mewtwos vs 6 mewtwos
The world is doomed.
MadSurge, i have 2 on lvl 100
Im still awaiting the day when you can combine zekrom kyurem and reshiram to its origional form
Invi: good for you!
ditto ^^
oy, whos your guys fav animaniacs characters?
05so im thinking....
All of them, Bronysith.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdZBvGp3sTE&feature=channel&list=UL

Hi, DinkyDoo. :)
Bronysith: Doesn't it already have that?
OMG I LOVE COLRESS BATTLE THEME!!!!!
AJIsAwesome: not yet
I see it on the HUB from time to time.
AJIsAwesome: I thought they did
Animaniacs and Batman TAS are the two best animated shows ever
It's usually on certain days or late at nights.
One for comedy adn the other for just pure epicness
I was more a Pinkie and the Brain kind of guy
The last episode I saw of that on the HUB was the Mr. Freeze backstory episode.
SpadeMagnes[R: thats animaniacs
Ah, the Wheel of Morality.
turn turn turn
So many FOX jokes. :D
SpadeMagnes[R: it is part of the animaniacs,
Wheel of Morality turn turn turn
AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/87b35c268c037262f658c8fc6ff58b6e.jpg best sisters :3
Away, you children and give me the bird!
A stream!
Bronysith: they show it
Yakko: Oh, I'd love to but the FOX censors wouldn't allow it.
Bronysith: they have been since september of last year
oh, stream's starting
Why is Fox so easy to make fun of?
cowvarkian: they already have batman TAS on the hub?
No more youtube links beyond this point.
yes
SpadeMagnes[R: cause they stupid
Bronysith: they have for a year
cowvarkian: that is really good to know
MadSurge: She sure is. :D
Has the Aquabats been confirmed for another season?

05also spitfirecolt: i dotn even know who you are.
Of course. :3

It was.

But it was pretty creepy.
Especially the Fan Club episode.

Comical insanity, I would say.

Hopefully it's good.

YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRR
Russia :3
IN SOVIET RUSSIA
AXES CUT YOU!
Mongols!
<.< why was he riding with mongols
MadSurge: Tibetans IIRC
Shaolin monks!
Xiaolin monks?
Actually, axes cut you anywhere. It's kind of what they were first made for.
I never saw Jack's legs in that scene, so I thought he was secretly part centaur. :D
Or Mongols*
05i think the style has ages very well
Shaolin*
05very seldom it uses outliens
05which is a feat
Bronysith: point taken
Indeed Wrek.
this sortof shits on any type of historical accuract though...
I like the style of this cartoon either way <3
this is much better than a typical "20 years later"
oh saurai jack
....AWWW!
but meh, its a cartoon
Wrek is right, the animation aged well with the time
It's his mom :3333
cowvarkian: It was never meant to be "historically accdurate".
d'aww
Kencolt: yeah, I know
Mommy!
<3 MAMA
I'm just being nitpicky
So much storytelling, and not a single word is spoken, so awesome
^
^^
^^^
sup guys
cowvarkian: It's supossed to be it's own legend, it's own mythology
^^^^
IT IS TIME.
SHITS ABOUT TO GO DOWN
AWESOME MUSIC.
is this samuri jack
Dark92Enigma: yes, I know
>.> ads
i love how the BGM speaks for itself in scenes like this <-----
How exciting >w<
Hai everypony
I can tell you one thing, early One Piece hasn't aged well. The production values have gotten gradually better over time, and looking at the first episodes over the latest ones is painful
Hey DerpyMuffins!
hi DerpyMuffins
05that tinkling sound is the strikign of pickaxes btw
Ohai DerpyMuffins
how've you been DerpyMuffins
Hi, DerpyMuffins. :)
Hai DerpyMuffins :)
Kandarihu: i was thinking of watching that, havnt seen it since itoonami left
Samurai Jack?
i havent seen this show in forever
He's baaaaaack.
yup
S1?
FIRST WORD EVER
Bronysith: no, Aku already spoke.
cratorkid, I still recommend it. Just be prepared to pace yourself on it. It's Loooooong
Kandarihu: true, but several animes started that way. One Piece akes forever though
MadSurge: that dont count
NINJAS
BREAK= First word......d'aaaaaaaaawww they're learning so fast :'(
Ninja vs samurai
im not gonna lie the animation hacent aged really well
HE HAS RETURNED.......
Such flow. Such style.
VIOLENCE
I want a replica of that sword
HOLY SHIT
he looks so weird here
This is the season finally?
and he is actually holding the sword correctly
His poor father...
having the blade facing up is the right way to hold the sword in its scabbard
DerpyMuffins: nope, the very first episode
hahahaha
Old man words
horse
PONY
Those words of wisdom.
random horse spawned
It is not the weapon, it is the wielder
^

/me is the master of masters

/me Akuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!
Dark92Enigma: gesundheit
Except Jack.
OUCH, that hurt
Any questions?
LadyCanary: remember the water episode? where jack allies with those thugs or something, god its been forever
Aku: it doesn't matter what shape you turn into, you can't defeat the power of rectitude!
I really do love Aku's forms.
I said it correctly, right¨?
Dat face
am i he only one that thinks that guy sound like uncle iroh from avatar
dat scorpion which would only impale him
RIGHTNOUSNESS.....again, i grew up with a different dub
I KNEW IT
05i ahve seen enough hentai...

Wrek: no, dont you fucking dare ruin my childhood
You just had to didn't you Wrek?
05aye
OLE!
HEADSHOT
DECAPITATI- nevermind
Silly Wrek.

<3
^

Was this ever properly ended?
BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO! :)
cowvarkian: you're comming in late xD
No DerpyMuffins
DerpyMuffins: Nope.
Sonny: I know
lol
DerpyMuffins: to this day....nope
The creator is still working on the finale I believe.
DerpyMuffins: not yet unfortunately :(
Pity
He's had a lot on his plate lately, though.
that sound bite
I would love to have see the end
LadyCanary: he is, when i found out something else (PM you later)
Sonny: I'm not actually trying to spoil things
Cool.
I'm being facetious
I LOVE THIS INTRO
I like how he speaks ^^
^
Invi: of course you do, its Mako
Where my evil is LAW
:d
first episode of that show i ever see
05even the pilot back in the 60's
hmm
Wrek: YES.
Wrek YESH
Thank you, Wrek.
ah, Samuroo jackoo
Good for the kiddies.
05MadSurge: aye :P
not gonna lie i used to love this show but the more i watch it know it does seem to age a little bit badly. dont get me wrong its still good but idk
i wanted the cat to win ;~;
....
it seems to have aged fine to me...
twilight_sprinkle: He won sometimes.
twilight_sprinkle: he does sometimes
but I like 2d things
It aged just fine.
rarely tho
FREE
FREEFALLING
Dat face
and somehow survives
WHAM
LadyCanary: i liked the show al lot as a kid, i still do now, but not as much because it hasnt aged that well the more i look back on it
i hope he wears underwear...
twilight_sprinkle: It's usually becuse Tom is the one starting things.
I think that jack is made of antimatter
/me facedesks
AJIsAwesome: exactly
Why is mama facedesking ;_;
AJIsAwesome: stop startin'! but idk, imo a mouse tha steals food is the one that starts
Because people are being ignorant.
05dont worry LadyCanary
05the twat speaks out of his ass
I remember Jack trolling Aku
now that i think about it, this show aged just fine
^
Mama and Dada!
oh my god, somoene with a different opinion? what a prick, lets ban him
do people actually think Tom usually started the shit?
twilight_sprinkle: ikr
i mean, look at teh animation, it is awesome
^
To be honest, it would be a bad day if BronyState started banning pricks.
Wrek: dude shut the fuck up says the guy who hates sonic and samuri jack without even a full true formed opinion come on calm down
Dat talk
05PRODIGIOUS!
Buytoast: most of the time yes :D
ScootaChicken: wait, we don't do that?
We'd lose such valuable members of the community, like twilight_sprinkle.
I don't understand a single word
Dafuq?
RADICAL
GROOVALICIOUS
ScootaChicken: lawl.
Why is he wearing a lava lamp on his head?
DerpyMuffins: I think they're discussing the weather.
Ans that's how he got his name
Bronysith: Why not?
come to think of it, why am i not wearing a lava lamp on my head?
anyway i g2g,bye
MIGGITY MACK DADDY WACK
Bronysith: Why wouldn- yeah

Wud up Jac?
05BIZEH BIZAAAH
Liquid Refreshment.
Or he must be a huge sell out
LD
:D
Wrek: Fo shizzle
Why did I just scratch my eye with chili-infected fingers.
J_E_Smith71: aku owns everything, one would think
Bronysith: yeah basically
GOOD ONE JACK!
Kammerjunk: You've caught the stupid from mane chat.
too late
Invi: They don't. In fact, his "real" name is never stated... they're just the kind of people who call people "jack".
Wrek: look we got off on the wrong foot how about we just put our differences aside and forget this all happened. after all isnt the poin of mlp to ove and tolerate no matter their differences. what d'ya saw man. truths?
Refresh myself? "buffering" oh shit,
cowvarkian: there will always be resistance
'With the new Wii AkU, slaughter many with the power of darkness and the fury of an angry god."

Kammerjunk: Loved the designs in the show.

Dark92Enigma: Like an evil Judge Dredd. Is Jack kind of like a time cop, then?
AJIsAwesome: these kinda look like those monsters from that one Powerpuff Girls episode
DerpyMuffins: hahahaha no

Dark92Enigma: He was indeed frozen today.

Oh and happy thanksgiving, everypony. /

Oh yes. Happy thanksgiving to everyone who celebrates it.
everything is terrible
Actually, haven't seen most of you in a while.
Oh, I'm on the chat, ScootaChicken. I'm just a little less talkative of late.
Lasharus: best. comeback. EVER
Yeah, stream died all of a sudden
It WAS non-existant, but now I know this little factoid about it.
Lasharus: Oh no, it's more to do with the fact that this is the first time I've logged onto mane chat in a couple months, ahaha.
That'll work as well, ScootaChicken. :P
Did the stream die?
Lasharus: it's ok, bro
So, is the Macy's Day Parade over?
LadyCanary: i beleive so
>Arrive
I think so, Canary.
>Apparently stream died
LadyCanary, yeah. Stream's dead
String_Shredder: It will never be as good as Indian Stallone.
stream is ded.........NO BIG SURPRISE
>everything I touch dies.mp4
Lasharus: It featured that wrestler nobody but MTV cares about anymore. He thinks Afterburner is a game about aliens.
XD
That was the greatest buffer moment BronyState has ever had.
Meanwhile: except your mustache
String_Shredder: http://i.imgur.com/QQrwU.jpg best i can do
Heya
ScootaChicken: Boom boom robada
cowvarkian: he shaved
Put it this way Dark92Enigma - if you use a Robotnik/Eggman quote on me, I'll immediately recognise it. Same for a quote from Discworld.
Hello Meanwhile *hugs and lives*
Many other things, not so much.
Bronysith: huh
then everything he touches does die
Well, hi everyone. What was on before it apparently died?
Heya guys :)

ScootaChicken: Is Dermathil even around at the moment?
ScootaChicken: except everything

Kammerjunk: I don't know, and I don't particularly care either.
Fair 'nuff.
Did Wrek disconnect again?
Derm doesnt come in anmore
cowvarkian: hey were all bronies here man /)

Kandarihu: there's a lot of implied deaths though
Shut up Spongebob

woah, that is tom D:
science
Ahhh.... Thanksgiving is awesoe...
Mr.Science?

Thats hot
MadSurge, a million is a statistic. The only reason Jack was sent to the future to fight robots is to AVOID violence where living beings can come to harm.
mecha jack
/me burps "There's the chicken..."
composite armor never last more than half an episode
Congratz Jack, now you look like an egg.

The thing is, if people die, censors say no.

Is it cuz you're stressed?
ahaha
XD
/me falls over laughing
:D
lol
:D
Lets beat him-* burps and snore *-.... where's the robot?
Kandarihu: there's at least one episode where living things die

Who needs to jump good when you have a rocket pack.
05BUZZ LIGHTYEAR
I believe I can fly!

He can't jump THAT good...

To infinity and then a bit more.

Meanwhile, the skill to jump good could still come in handy, even with this.
dem star wars drones
you must learn to use the force

Totally.

That's how science work.
i thought that sends you forward
up up up!
I heard "This theory is very sound" in the crowd
here's a secret "gaps"
The escape pod is a tree, your argument is invalid.
:L
Wait. If Jack goes back into the past and defeats Aku, wouldn't all his expieriences in the future cease to exist?
"I'd like to be a tree"
i <3 science :D
*experiences
[SLURRED] Why don't we BLOW up the recreation of the Empire State building in Los Angeles.
Meanwhile, it was probably modelled after a tree to try to avoid detection
I do not <3 science.
Aperture labratories thanks you. Your 60$ will be arriving shortly

08,01i think Too Many Pinkie pies was lazily written, flandersised, and possibly the worst episode of the entire show

Jageman: so a slightly more powerful bomb?
PengWin?
MadSurge: less powerful

Fucking ravers, get out of my yard.
Pika-Picho: Not even close. :D
MadSurge: kinda yes
this show was ahead of its time
nah this was before Pika-Picho
D:
they predicted the future quite well
DUBSTEP IS EEEEEEEEVIL
no
EEZ GETTING ALL WUBSTEP UP IN HERE
This is not dubstep people
there is good dubstep..
........
^
this is not dubstep
MadSurge: nuclear weapons are kinda sensitive.
^ twilight_sprinkle
This is like straight up techno iirc
i always knew raving would evolve in to complete a holes destroying stuff
KILL THEM JACK!!
hooligan!
Jageman: like nuclear centrals?
....Aw :(
:<
oots oots oots oots
MadSurge: if you mess up the first stage explosion, it will not work as well
This isn't dubstep.
i remember these guys!
techno is evil, i knew it
unts unts unts unts unts
where did that air on kandi
Jageman: hmmhmm
What a horrible night to have a rave
The music changes kids.

This is NOT Dubstep, my friend.
Yes it is dubstep :c

Its not damnit
./)_-
So that's what downtown Durham is like at night...
this was way before dubstep
Can't be dubstep, hearing it doesn't make me want to stab myself in the ears.
Poor guy
JamesClydesdale, no it aint
So it's techno music.
confusing electronic with dubstep ...
that was techno
spitfirecolt, I'm not sure about Lilpri, but the end of Madoka Magica was delayed for 6 weeks due to the Sendai Earthquake.
i'm not used to music
In fact, I don't even think dubstep even existed before this.
And those kids were Zombie Ravers.
MadSurge: I do know that if you mess up bad enough, none of the core material will undergo fission, making the bomb almost useless.
Its techno
Im not sure dubstep even existed at this time.
His hair looks like a girl.
where u live at kandi
Alchemist: It didn't.
anyone getting a buffer?
MadSurge: cutting it in half would do that
my little girl, techno is evil magic
no buffer here
That's a weird looking 45 record...
pony_8845: Every now and then.
This was when the rave scene was still mainstream
Jageman: so it's easy to defuse them :D
I AM SOOOO ded
Dubstep existed when this was made, but had yet to catch on on the internet
well they werent go at predicting the i pod
oni_link: maybe a bit later
never heard of that show in the us
TECHNO KILLS SO KILL IT BEFORE IT KILLS YOU!!
MY LITTLE PONEH
(/
Kandarihu: Ah, okay. I still wouldn't consider this dubstep, though.
oni_link: I think it was at its peak in the mid 90s.
MadSurge: cutting the bomb in half would ruin the shielding
I BETCHOO NO ONE HAR IS A BRONEH!
dj-pon3 is evill, send her to the sun
Jageman: still, concentrated in one spot
becasue it isnt
Alchemist: it was fairly big at the time just not as big as it once was
umm

DJ-PON3 is OP, nerf now.

:D
Bronysith: yeah so they dont chew on their tongues when theyre on their drugs
Bronysith: Its always nessisary
dat waldo hat
When you're raving, pacifiers are necessary.
oni_link: of course, the ecstasy
If RD was real,i would dare her to do this.
this is why i wear three piece suits
MadSurge: although i could see him deflecting a laser.
xD
Bronysith: glad someone knows
Jack you suck.
DJ @ku

Meanwhile: o u

Jageman: lasers and evil robots :D but he went to space and destroyed a satellite already :D

Kandarihu: I know, just making a joke about the whole pacifier thing.
again, we never know Jacks name, that is crazy
Anyways dem moves.

pony_8845: NO.
Heh. He doesn't know how to dance, so he's just doing his forms
Bronysith: just his nickname :)
Ok this is nice.
Kandarihu: as much dancing as anything
Except that Jack seems to be the only one here who has one

spitfirecolt: I may play the game someday, I am aquiring muneez.
hey guys....
Yes/
yeah?
*.
AJIsAwesome: isn't that how we judge eachother?
CCCP: *hugs back*
is it wrong to have fun in Nintendo Land?
Nope.
naw
cause seriously
Hey thelonepony
I wuv that game
<3
Hi DoctoDoctorWho :)
cowvarkian: Ah, re-read my sentence. Sorry about that.
the hell is nintendo land
Let me rephrase.
i never seen a game cost so much u have to build a board buy the army books and scenery just to play
AJIsAwesome Dat's cool and all but you think AJ is awesome. I dislike that very much so I'm judging you on your opinions so I dislike you now.
:3
thelonepony: Thanks for keeping a lookout, :)
We really shouldnt judge each other. People have their opinions and characteristics.
you're welcome:)
DashWithRainbows: I love you too DWR.
but
I'm
AJIsAwesome: but anyway i left rating the series 10/10. With an animation style way ahead of it's time, charismatic and influential characters, and a thrilling mythology of it's own, Samurai Jack still holds up to this day
Ew, gay.
very disapointed in Paper Mario Sticker Stars
i was like im so tempted to put this in your cart(amazon) and she said go ahead :>
Hi DashWithRainbows! *hugs*
hi people
Ohai See-See-See-Pee.
hi DashWithRainbows!
And hey to you, Dark92Enigma.
Sorry for the misinterpretation, cowvarkian.
hi, im hunter
Hello, headhunter.
no opinion on my review..........i forgot the kickass soundtrack and intense battles
but seriously
Paper Mario Sticker Star is......very very different
wacha chatin aout?
Sticker Star.
It completely changed the formula of the game
CrystalPhoenix: no rpg element?
removing the charm in it
thelonepony, VERY VERY few RPG elements
There isn't really a reason to battle any enemies in the game, IMO.
no level up upgrades
that reminds me, I should get super paper mario sometine
no badge points
no FP points
thelonepony: You have finite attack uses and you run out your screwed
You collect stickers to use in battle, and they're gone once you use them.
yeah
Only thing that goes up is HP
You have no partners either
and that's an item
sticker star is that a console game
3dsa
You get coins in battle, but what do you use them on? More stickers.
3ds**
AJIsAwesome, and roulette
also
spitfirecolt: so how much 40k lore are you familiar with?
STAGES
bah sounds like a bad Paper Mario RPG
I'm back.
so stream is dead while I was gone?
yeah Stages
mmhmm
wb VenHur
I do like the visuals in the game, though. They're not bad.
it's not open world no more
it's stages
10 minutes till ABC's Micheal Jackson special
AJIsAwesome, the visuals are like the ones in TTYD
Speaking of which
CrystalPhoenix: Well Super Paper Mario was like that too
no story
Guys, just because you hates the newest Paper Mario game doesn't mean is bad in general!
CrystalPhoenix you sure this is a paoer mario game?
>.> are they going to raise him from the dead? J_E_Smith71
You'll get used to it like Luigi's Mansion!
Deacon, to be honest I really am not anymore
Didn't people say that the 3DS'graphics are comparable to the Gamecube?
happy thanksgiving everypony!
it says Paper Mario
which it's different with the new spongebob
but it's not
Happy Thanksgiving, haseo348. :)
not much never played it before right now i am playing malifaux doctordoctorwho
AJIsAwesome some people say
Used to be underrated, but thanks to Let's Plays, peoples opinions had changed.
AJIsAwesome: game cube graphics are pretty good
By the way: Happy Thanksgiving everypony!
happy thanksgiving haseo348!
:D
askstalkerloo is getting married
im eating right now :D
VenHur, It's an interesting concept but.....
happy thanksgiving Dark92Enigma
it's not Paper Mario
where's the story
gonna get ready for black friday also
where's the humour
where's the badges
it scares me
is there a story to it?
Deacon, barely
Derpy_Hooves: to how?
like you meet up with some shiny sticker crown and she joins you to collect some royal stickers
thelonepony irl
who* :P
Derpy_Hooves: cool
the levels has no backstory at all
unlike the previous games where each world had some interesting background
Nopony knows more lore than me~
maybe people don't like JRPG elements anymore....:(
:(
Tee hee hee, hee hee hee hee
dat ice king
but heh I've only beaten the first world so maybe the game will turn out interesting
Heh LOL moment on the Patriots vs Jets game. Guy missed the hand off and ran into his own lineman
maybe
DoctoDoctorWho: duh hell is wrong with you?
with me and my 1000 coins
right after the first world
Deacon: I do
.......gosh
Dovah: I dont know, mabey im on krak?
DoctoDoctorWho: oh ok, carry on then
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ
but yeah really sad to see that there's no partners
especially when I thought we would have a chain chomp partner
lergmaflishpelgmaninerpfishdoloodlepkerloopydop
?
Oh god guys watch the Patriots vs Jets game on right now, so many fail moments.
CCCP I WAS SEARCHING FOR THAT VIDEO
CrystalPhoenix: that would've been awesome
CrystalPhoenix :3
I think the internets affecting me...
for those who want to buy Sonic Generations, Amazon has it for $7
Which version?
Steam
50% cheaper than the Steam Store
which is $14
but
Okay guys on ABC Micheal jackson documentary is starting
PC version is better
J_E_Smith71: what channel?
also when i got back home i watched Yogi bear
thelonepony: I said ABC
J_E_Smith71: i thou... nevermind
Zamer: >.>
I'm going to hope in that context it meant "fuck with" not "fuck"
Zamer pics or it didn't happen
let me see if i can find the episode online
hopefully i get the derpy <3
no stream?
*sigh* I forgot how tedious breeding for natures are...
no stream atm
Rex_Mundi: Nope you missed Wrek's Samurai Jack/CN marathon
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jruPdPAQbxU
J_E_Smith71, I'm not sure there are a lot of football fans here
how often are there streams?
they varie on the weekdays
when they feel like it
^
Rex_Mundi: lol dat game
ok
headhunter: Random during the weekdays
CCCP: love that game. most underrated game ever.
Rex_Mundi ikr?
damn Rex why you make me miss the Samurai Jack/CN marathon
headhunter: On Firday planned Movie Night stream at 7 PM EST, on Saturday at 10:30 AM new episode is shown, at 2 PM movie encore is shown.
Hi Guys :)
Whats going on?
CCCP: Would it be awesome if SEGA revived the series and made an Ecco #3?:O. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5Dcd-0-JVw
bah
Hi sonicdude558 :)
Skies of Arcadia is needed!
Rex_Mundi: YES! :D
Kandarihu: Neither am I, but I keep going in to the other room wher emy relatives are watching it becuase thyekeep laughing out loud because there were a couple of Fail moments going on
Rex_Mundi I would've liked to see ecco riding a vehilce in sega all stars racing
CCCP: Its really what the gaming industry neads, a hardcore gamers game like Ecco. There are too many Causual gamer games with wicked easy difficulty.
http://i.imgur.com/21pa2.png
Rex_Mundi: News flash, there WAS a third game. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecco_the_Dolphin:_Defender_of_the_Future
Rex_Mundi heh I agree
VenHur: That doesnt count
Rex_Mundi, they will casualized Ecco
Rex_Mundi: It doesn't?
dat PonyChat
VenHur: Its not a sequile to Ecco 2, it has its own story, made by different people.
Deacon: Or at least see him in the background or something.
Rex_Mundi: True...the Ecco series along with Toejam and Earl and deffinetly Ristar and Alex Kidd was overshadowed by Sonic...
sonicdude558: i wish.......
sonicdude558: that would be the BEST INSTALL BUTTON ever
I had to take that screencap when I was installing my Persona
VenHur: Its like... SEGA wants to forget Ecco even existed for some reason. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk72RMv9d0s
Good luck Deacon
there was no ponies in the parade
ikr
Ecco only got two games, a game made for the younger audience, and a "reboot".
it needed some HUB and HASBRO
why would sega want to forget ecco
bc it didn't sell
that's why
Skies of Arcadia FTW!
there was a problem with pikachu
Has Alex Kidd ever been in a game recently?
damn internet why do you fail me twice today
Someone HAS to sign up a petion to make SEGA the greenlight for a new Space Harrier, Alex Kidd II.
his ears deflated :\
Billy Hatcher 2...Ecco III.
sadly I cannot find the episode online that doesn't belong to Amazon or Itunes
A new Space Channel 5...a new Crazy Taxi...etc.
Zamer, episodes of?
the Yogi Bear episode i mentioned
ooooh
someone wanted the infamous proof lol
VenHur: A new comix zone, new earthworm jim. Damn, SEGA has a ton of things it can make games for, why doesnt SEGA do anything with these liscences!
I love Crazy Taxi, the first time I heard of it was not from the actual game itself, but a ripoff called "Simpsons Road Rage".
Comix Zone was hard as fuck...
Comix Zone was unique on its own
But Earthworm Jim 4?! Yes...YES!
it doesn't need a sequel
Comix Zone WAS hard
THAT WILL BE GROOVY!
goddammit it was hard
also, SHINING FORCE!
Comix Zone was hard because lol 1 life
I love Shinging Force
CrystalPhoenix: and no continues and few powerups
well sale wise all Sega games are Cheaper Amazon(Steam) than from Steam itself
I like Earthworm Jim 1 and 2...I hates 3-D...but 4 can make it up for it...
OK SEGA, bring back Ecco, Comix zone, Earthworm ji, etc...
We had an re-release of the game in HD...but that doesn't count!
gtg everypony see ya all tomorrow
And House of The Dead, damn it!
I know you can get Ecco and Ecco 2 on Nintendos virtual consol.
Shining...Freaking...FORCE!
Heard it was an RPG...
thing is though if you get a WiiU you apparently have to rebuy the VC games even if you transfer everything from your wii
and Shining Force FTW
Oh yes, and a new Phasaty Star!
A NEW. FREAKING. PHANTASY STAR.
ehh?
All these liscenses, what the hell is SEGA thinking? That a new sonic game, if good, can make up for all the bad?
Bye Dark-
yes
Who doesn't love Billy Hatcher? That one kid in the CHICKEN SUIT FROM THE GODS!
Why do so many people hate on Sonic Fans?
yes it can
I like sonic...
as long as it's classic sonic
because he's Sonic and if Sonic fails, then well
CCCP: It depends, there are many different kinds of sonic fans
chat derped
better call Mario
I mean, Billy is awesome...he rolls up eggs, hatchs up eggs, and defeat crows...
bah
SKIES OF ARCADIA!
Oh boy Sonic fandom
Rex_Mundi i guess, i just never understood the hate for the fans
VenHur that reminds me of that episode of Billy and Mandy
CCCP: There are the retro fans of the games. The fans of the new games. Sonic sat/am fans. Sonic X fans...
You haven't seen the Sonic fandom
There is only one true Sonic Fandom
Rex_Mundi well people seem to hate on the modern fans
and Thats the Sonic Underground fans
I don't like the modern games, and can't understand how people do
Zamer, you mean....that show with the instruments?
yes the one and only
/me used to watch that show
Rex_Mundi buts thats like 85% of all fans for everything
CCCP: Well, the fans always whine and moans when Sonic gets a bad game, they'll all like "SONIC'S A WEREWOLF, NOOOOOO!" and then they're like "SONIC HAS A SWORD, NOOOOOO!", and then they're like "SONIC GOT KISSED BY A HUMAN GIRL, EVEN IF THE EVENTS OF SONIC 06 WAS NON-EXISTAINT, NOOOOO!"
Rex_Mundi, you mean like Bronies?
don't forget they also rule 34 the shit out of the main characters as well
HUEHUEHUE
Sorry for the spam...
But you get the idea.
Zamer: but so do we
VenHur lol
Hey the Micheal Jackson thing is showing never before seen deleted scenes from Bad
hey Zamer Blaze is one hot chick
Zamer: and every other fandom ever
as far as i know since i don't go into the clopping section of our fandom include erotic rule 34 fics
tooooo muchhhh freeee time http://i48.tinypic.com/2s1qjuo.png
yeaaa
the 34 content of MLP is pretty large
Zamer: that doesn't mean it doesn't exist
never said it didnt
at this rate it could reach the same ammount as Touhou
CCCP: But haul thier asses, I like EVERY SINGLE SONIC GAMES KNOWN TO MAN...Yes, I loved Sonic 06 as a guilty pressure.
Zamer: meh
and i know we rule 34 the shit out of the cast of MLP
Wheres the episode
http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/loadingreadyrun/1877-The-Arms-Race
but i haven't heard of any clop fics with said rule 34
6_9
...Probally the only guy that loved Sonic 06 outside of the story...
:P
Zamer: yeah we do! <3
VenHur wow
Zamer, what do you mean?
Im talking to choclate milk
Sure it had its flaws...but the music's kicks ass.
there's alot of erotic fanfic
with rule 34 in it as well?
I think i'm seeing a patern here before Colours camed out...
what do you mean exactly by rule 34
oh wait
Zamer: Erotic fanfiction is written porn, thus R34
The games were bad...but the music are good...
i was thinking of Rule 63
Zamer, through bow and arrow
too much turkey got my internet rules confused
The whole gender thing?
Rule 63+clop fiction i meant
yea
I like ponies
Hey Guys! Brohoof! /]
Rex_Mundi I like people who don't like poh-knees.
:3
Zamer, one could find that easily
Ranma 1/2 = The birth of Rule 63.
oh God
yes
I thought it was Sumi's OC that started R63
sadly
Molestia has a Rule 63 gun
You know what always freaked me out though?
then gained renewed powers thanks to Haruhi Suzumiya
I love Sumicas OC pony
hey
So the next MLP episode is in 21 hours?
What if Ranma got drunk and knocked up? Seriously I cannot be the only one who thought of that weird ass scenario
...You know, I always want to make a Rule 64.
11,02Dat 64 ping
what was rule 64
^
RULE 64 = Favorite N64 game of all time.
otakon, oh the wonders of genderbending
11,02Glover
No expectations.
it's weird
Link = Best Rule 63
that's all there is to it
um
just sayin
Hi SuperBrony64! :)
11,02Hai :3
Link R63?
He's already an elf
gonna go for a bit
bye
http://derpy.me/EV5Lz
Hai SuperBrony64
he WEARS A SKIRT!
Hai SuperBrony64
R63 R63

Touche
I see what they did there
THERE!
Still waiting for WiiU update SuperBrony64?
I C IT!
WHAT THEY DID!
11,02DerpyMuffins: o u
oh SuperBrony64 Sonic Generations is onsale at Amazon for $7
So uhh, who started the rules of the internet conversation
11,02Really?
SuperBrony64, Sonic Generation is pretty cool
Oh yeah, and another franchise for the SEGA pettion, Golden Axe!
you should get it if you like Sawnic
Going back to SEGA... Toe jam and earl isnt a good game.... there, i said it.
AJfan77: when it get's to Hitler it's complete
11,02As a PC download?
it started with Yogi Bear than went to Sega, than went to Sonic Fandom,
and yes
Rex_Mundi: Blasphemy!
Steam code though
http://www.amazon.com/Sega-40836Generations1-Sonic-Generations-Download/dp/B005XOJ6NK/ref=sr_1_1_title_2?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1353637772&sr=1-1&keywords=sonic+generations
11,02Oh okies, I already have it >< But that's awesome though :D
11,02Everypony should get it o-o
NO
seriously for that price
I do not get Sonic
VenHur: Golden Axe already tried reimerging, the game sucked.
^
^^
Zamer I would reccomend using the site derpy.me to make links smaller

>.>
:l
Ah, the Hitler jokes. Hitler can't catch a shiny pokemon, to Hitler yelling about another Bubsy game.
Damn it Dusk.
I was tempting to get Sonic Adventures 1&2 for like $5 but than i read about all the bugs in Sonic 1
hitler is best pokemon
/me luffs on a DashWithRainbows <3
Rex_Mundi: Yeah, but what about a re-reboot that does NOT suck? AND IN 16 bits?
Rory is best pokemon
Zamer, those bugs are the charm of the games
Hell, they brings 8 bit Megaman back.
Captain Falcon is best pokemon
AJfan77 lol
Speaking of SEGA, Rome 2 Total War is being made.
<.<
Crystal not when they weren't in the original and the steam version is a massive downgrade to the 2004 pc port
Captain Falcon is best F-Zero racer
You should know that I can't let others see me do /me things, MakerDusk.
I like how the only pokemon thing ive ever watched is that banned episode
which one
There's no other game that will let you go face to face against a STREET WIDE GIANT TRUCK http://youtu.be/hnUgeEGstDU
The Porygon episode?!
Only knows one move: Falco PAWNCH. Accuracy: 100 Attack power: Insta faint
But still, <3
Zamer the one with the flashing lights
CCCP: The FREAKING Porygon episode that gaved kids seizures?!
you should watch the Beach episode
James has boobs
and it wasn't Porygon's fault either
Pikachu was the one who blew up the rockets
CCCP: Dude, you got some balls of steel...
I love how team rocket Cross-dreses all the time for no reason.
CCCP: Watch out fellas, he's a bad ass!
and Everytime The brats fall for it
VenHur lol
Rex_Mundi, James had breast even
CrystalPhoenix: I know
inflatable breasts but breasts nonetheless
inflatable ones, that was even the joke
Zamer: Japan's weird as fuck, yo.
Did you know there is a fail rate for a Master Ball
A fail rate...for the fucking Master Ball?
hi everypony:)
...Psshnah!
AJfan77, I'm sorry for the sucker that missed with a master ball
1 in 67,000 chance
Reason for the Beach episode in the U.S. was because they feared it would promote gay lifestyles
Did you know Seth MacFarlane helped write Dexter's Laboratory?
'Tis a joke.
Zamer: lolwut
http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/post/36134940091/what-japan-thinks-of-mlp121-with-timestamps
The Family Guy guy? Oh, yeah, I heard of that.
he actually didn't miss, the Swalot used Swallow
yea
Rex_Mundi you made me think that was a new episode with timestamps
There are actually some King of the Hill episodes dubed in japanese on Niconico.
Welll imdb doesn't lie http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0532235/
Zamer: sorry
Spongebob in greek ive seen it

Guys.....I don't know
I've never bought anything from welovefine and I vowed not too but.....
only fanmade pony merch I have is this Luna hoodie
why did you vow not to buy anything from them CrystalPhoenix
because
there just flashy
annoyingly flashy and attention grabbing
don't you know Rarity is the lead designer
not THE Rarity
of course they would be flashy and attention grabbing
also Today has been one of the best days in gaming
mmh?
got DOTA2 today for free
thanks to a unknown pony
who wouldn't register :(
Dota sucks imo
LoL even more
Zamer, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E5FFFYRUgI
and HoN even more
just never understood the appeal of realt time action games
different things for different folks
to be on your guards
and be prepared for anything
if i want to play an rpg, ill play an rpg. if i want to play an rts, ill play an rts. i dont wanna play an rts were i only control one unit, and a rpg were my charcter only has 4 abilities
http://www.livestream.com/katkitty21 gaming stream going on
true the start of the games are broing grind and last hit
come on in
So how many people will be here tomorow night?
otakon: what u streaming?
not me
it's Majora's Mask
otakon: dat advertising
otakon, Do not advertise in chat
Links to external sites are not allowed during streams unless you are given permission by a moderator. Do not advertise other sites or channels. If you want to share a link, PM it to your recipient. Advertising in chat without consent is prohibited.
it's Majora's Mask
THERE IS NO STREAM
I really hate that part
therefore not against the rules
and otakon is right on this one
if there was a stream I wouldn't have linked it
otakon: actually advertising is never allowed
it's not advertising
cause from what I heard that rule was supposed to be at all time
twilight_sprinkle Majora's Mask
it's better than looking at a buffer circle isn't it?
i dont care myself. its just funny how if you werent a regular you would get at least a warning
twilight_sprinkle, no mods are active
well someone is up
and how it is advertising?
besides no stream atm
HEY GUYS COME WATCH THIS
CrystalPhoenix: yeah but it wouldntve happened anyway. like i said im not against it,i just find it funny
you do put up a point there twilight_sprinkle
why dont they just play the intermission music I like it it's soothing
hell, ive seen a regular post an ebay link for a friend so people here would buy it
he got no warning, and there were mods
otakon: whats ur relation with her?
Star_Gazer: in the same skype group, just popped up suddenly and I jumped in. Hell don't even know her really
Will you guys stop talking legal mumbojumbo
it's one of the greatest games alive
also otakon Majora's Mask?
more like Overstreamed game
let it override current thinking processes
Majora's Mask can never get overstreamed
I'm not getting a stream.
Majoras mask=Best zelda
AJfan77: it's off for now
yea it's Majora's Mask
Zamer, and how about it's to a point where EACH TIME I hear about a stream I never heard about they stream Majora's Mask
I agree with Star_Gazer
also Link's Awakening is best Zelda
I love Link's Awakening
Hello.
CrystalPhoenix: die
hiya Valhalla_Fusion no stream atm
lol
Star_Gazer, why?
Seriously I friggin' LOVE Link's Awakening
Majora's mask > OoT
Link's awakening is the best because of that Ballad
Time to make Legend of Zelda fanboys rage. I loved Twilight Princess.
http://youtu.be/u6T5n8zSbX0
AJfan77, that's cool
Midna is a pretty cool character
nah
TP was a good game
Ocarina of time #4 on my list for 2 reasons.
what's #1 2 3
1 Majora's Mask 2 Twilight Princess 3 The original
one question
Ocarina of time is A link to the past in 3d
why do so many people like Midna
agreed
as in think she's attractive like...
otakon, you do not want to know
I dun get it
I mean I know about the end game
but I've stumbled upon ...stuff of her BEFORE that
Ocarina of time is 4th on my list because of Na'vi and the Water Temple. BUCK! THE WATER TEMPLE! I WAS ON IT FOR 2 WEEKS!!!
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Welovefine Adds Purple Horn, Achievements
AJfan77: i was on it for 30 minutes
lol
Well I wasnt so good for you :)
Star_Gazer what version did you play
n64
duh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnTnhmwwUYs THIS GUY
GUYS Watch this video
The original N64 Still have the console too
cause that guy is like THE Ocarina player
I prefer the Song of storms on ocarina. Thunder at end = awesome effect.
Hey bronies
is there a stream? :3
Guess not
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! To the Moon is 75% off, but only if you get the Game + OST bundle.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDX4ZwUeOok
Brohoof sonicdude558 /]
(\
/me throws a Twi plushie at AJfan77
To The Moon is more an experience than a game
The game alone is 66% off. Funny how you're paying less for more or more for less.
but the OST is goddamn emotional
Takes and runs with it
Should I get Torchlight 2?
it's only 15 bucks
Twilight 2?
Get it.
You won't regret it.
Don't buy the book
and don't see the movie 6_9
Can I ask you guys a favor?

You know what? I remember the one time I was part of a focus group. I was a teenager, and they screened boring ads for products that I really didn't care about.
99999
john madden
NYC_Brony Hey Ice King, Why did yah Steal our Garbage?!
its says that i am logged in
Hey, Kinect, here's a good idea, make a freaking DDR game! And make it NOT suck!
somehow
you have registered the nickname Zacklego. This means that all your flags and stuff are stored under this nick protected by your password. Once you log on with this nick, you can change nicks but still act under your aount
*acount
I think there was some sort of rule that my participation in that focus group disqualified me from future focus groups.
VenHur: Try Just dance. It will kill you.
...Okay, that's not possible
Buffer
VenHur: LOLOLOLOL
who has xbox live or skype?

why does this show attract the weirdest people I have ever seen?
00,100_o
Getting closer than 2 cousins in a bathtub
ded
pinkie pie
Daygon, this more than proves you suck at the game. You came on here challenged the first person who had the game and then started saying they suck just because they don't want to play the game at this time.
00,10well that was disapointing
indeed so
it always is
Well that's depressing
child sized ....
your mom is a wipeout
He has the CHild At Heart perk.
I didnt say you sucked. You just say you can beat me, which you say that you havent played this game in months
This commercial
slapped...by a car

And how, I have been playing this game, re-uped once, and still doing good
D:

Hi Bronystate

DOCTOR
STUPENDUS
STUPENDOUS!
Daygon: Implying that by not playing for a few months greatly lowers my skill.
It can
FUS RO DASH
Can, not difinitive.
that was some epic sentence mixing
her armor broke
sonicdude558, IKR
My brother, who hasnt played the game in months, who used to beat me. Now can kill me as he used to, well he could kill me.
Soooo.....GO AHEAD, TELL A FRIEND!
I really suck at typing
A shiney NEW AUUSTTRRRAAAALIAAAAAAA
someone really need to stream this
Daygon: so, he can still beat you?
It's ok Daygon
No he cant
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
D:
50 thousand dollars?!
That's a lot...
I'm.digging the new commercials
soooo what are we watching?
there is a difference of killing someone and beating someone
Also, I'm not your brother. Daygon
hey Sumica, is it just me or do you have WindowFX or some thing similar?
Sylandest: Wipeout

I hate her already.
AlienWarhead: ...why this?
00,10you meen the transisions?

Sylandest: because the streamer wanted it
/me brohoofs Sumica

ahh. fair does
00,10see
Pinkie
CrystalPhoenix: Maybe this one http://www.welovefine.com/3336-the-sparkly-night.html
Man, i do not rememver these DLCs taking so long
Daygon: Yeah, i probably lost some, but I can get it back relitivly quickly.
Heeeeh I might consider that one
It could, but it would take like 5 hours or more
Dial? And 12 and what is that?
Don't touch that dile
00,10He looks like Scoot-scootaloo
...So a feathery BEAST?!
Really?
If so...
Does anyone know anything about the new episode on Saturday?
...Huh...
no offence, but now I think that Scoot-scootaloo is kinda a troll/bitch/mean
...
after that one stream he streamed
I would be good at the big testicles... My assassin training would come in handy.
No and please be quiet and take it to p.m
sonicdude558: he's plays around with us :D
Daygon I do, but we can't spoil here
he*
this is sad to watch
ok, ill wait
and he's not mean or a "bitch"
sonicdude558 Shutup... last time I said something exactly like that but with wrek I was hated for a month.
the art contest stream back in october 31 was the worst stream ever. I thought the internet was dying
Time to download the longest DLC of gears
I think I remember that
It's a prerequisite for a mod to know how to troll o.o
^
mmmmBananas
fact
:>
00,10wait people calling scoot a troll?
Daygon: why so obsessed with gears all of a sudden? its quite old
Ooooh, BANANAS!
Those that gets the refference get a cookie.
00,10and here I thought I was the worst troll here
I got the limited edition of Gears of War Xbox
Rainbow chipped.
oh crap I forgot to text someone back
nah
Okay :P
but scoots gets on his mic and stops the video
And i never stop playing gears, its my game
I'm the worst troll here!
..
Wait, was that a sexist remark?
Sumica is lying
00,10ah
...Wait why
O_O
haha, he said Gulag.
GabeMoist, I dont even know how to troll, so dont say that.
Daygon: aaannd now i dont want to play with you, it seems like you focus on one game and dont get any diversity.
He actually went back
00,10yeah dont think I have ever stoped out right
No not really, i just play gears more then any other game
Gears?
What gears?
Gears of War
Now this a comerial break!
I still think someone should stream this
I'm guessing Sumi stream?
yes
eeyup
Hey I've been wondering what rank is Phase4 he doesn't have @ symbol but the + symbol. I know BerryPunch has a % because it's a bot but still what is Phase4?
Sumica: aren't I the worse troll?

TheRandomkid321, a wizard
TheRandomkid321: Part of the Bronystate staff, I think.
