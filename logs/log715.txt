I came
OH EMM GEE POKEMANZ
Who's doing that? :D
i stopped careing when Black and White came out T_T
...what are black and white? WE're talking about pokemon games
I"m still playing Pokemon games. :D
yeah
Smoking Boomer!
uh, they're the Gen V games TheBadger
damn over weight AND black lung
...>gen 5
also lag on my end
I liked Black and White. Still need to play Black 2 White 2. :D
same here but they went WAY to far with black and white FUCKING FLYING ICE CREAM CONES MAN FLYING ICE CREAM CONES!!
Is that gold and silver, or red and blue, since no ACTUAL pokemon games have been released past those
/me secretly has W2
Write a 2 beside White/Black
Bam,.
B&W2
And add loads of stuff, Joomay
>:l
DWR
Pls

Dj_Cyber-4G: I could say the same thing about Gen 1 and 2. :D
u now nothin
WHAT EMERALD IS MY FAVE
DWR is right jaymoo
anyways, before we devolve into bickering about gens, anyone want othelp me out?
Gen 4 and 5 don't exist to me.
past emerald it went shitborne
;__;
hmmm
daimond still my fav
diamond*
G1=G2=G3=G4=G5, IMO.
There is no bickering. Pokemon stopped at Gold and SIlver. There is no arguing aga8inst that unless you're a useless faggot
Joomay But you can fight the gym leaders + elite four + champions of older gens in B2 and W2
i played platnum, too easy and great story though
IDC
YES U DO
NO
DUNT LIE
I AIN'T
i almost got every pokeman on diamond legit.
Original generations or gtfo.

ok, I'll just stop talking about pokemon then, cause it seems I always tend to causse something
TheBadger: http://pinkie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw4548-applejack_jimmies_aint_rustled.jpg
NUT THE POKEMANS ARE FUCKING WEIRD AS HELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY CAME OUT OF THE DEEPEST PITS OF NEW JERSEY
There are 252 pokemon. That is it. If you think there are more, you're fucking retarded.
Well
Badger laying it down.
for me there are 493
I'm retarded then.
Because to me, there are over 600.
What there neads to be is an open sandbox Zombie game, where its like you trying out your zombie plan in a video game. Not a 'shoot hoards of zombies' game.
You're going to have to try harder than that, Badger. :P
AT least you understand that you are wrong.
Rex_Mundi interesting
At least you understand that you can't accept other poeple's opinions. :D
aaaand
.... Rex_Mundi like Project Zomboid?
it went PvP
*people's
Oh, I accept other people's opinions, that just have to understand that they are wrong.
Check out Project Zomboid
-lol god I love pipe bombs in l4d.
It was a nice attempt to rustle my jimmies, but you're going to have to do better than that.
TAAAAAAAANK
sounds familliar
Ayejay is stoopid
jimmies b rustled
Shush, Jaymoo. :D
Dken2021: Imagine, your character is getting supplies for your zombie hide out in a house, or you put stuff into a backpack and trek across the land looking for safty
:>
Jmo: dafaq did you just say....
Joomay is stoopider
Jmo: Oh that aj...
:D
nahp
chav is
Chav in college
prove he has smarts
College my ass.
Sounds like a nice college
/me puts Jmo's ass in college
aah em im gonna go play some TF2 if anypony wants to join me your welcome too
ikr
I bet it has a foul odour though.
Your argument has not changed my opinion. I like all the gens equally, so sucks to be you. :D
Chav, you wag everyday.
Admit it.
Who ells here saw the recent Resident Evil movie?
Naw
Dj_Cyber-4G: you doing mvm?
Jmo: :S
Once again, dont need to change your opinion. as long as im right.
it depends
>Implying there's a right opinion :D
Dj_Cyber-4G: If you are and you need a team ill join you.
MvM?
Back
Dj_Cyber-4G: Whats your name on steam btw?
I'm in
ok friend me my steam name is Dj_Cyber-4G
"It's my opinion therefore I am right, you are wrong."
id like to see that they accidently hit a witch
HavokOC: Man versus Machine.
No, im not implying, im stating the absolute fact that his opinion is wrong, AJ
DWR_TF2: Makes sense to me. :P
Let me see.
Mega_Milk, I know what MvM is :P
Try harder, Badger. :P
Just got home
The company behind Pokemon made the game, correct?
No need to
The company behind the recent "Sonic" games made the recent sonic games, right?
HavokOC: Oh sorry -lol I thought you were asking what it was :3
Dis gun b gud.
You remind me of those "genwunners", Badger. :D
Too many zombie games are just run-n-gun shoot everything action games, even resident evil has become this. Where is the survival horror I ask you?
just a question about this game
We're not talking about Soonac, we're talking about Pokeymonz.
doesn't make them any more sonic games that a FF game is a dragon warrior game
yay
how did those zombies apearred in the first place?
medical outbreak.
Snow: Plot convenience! :P
magical zombie fairies
^
and the fake pokemon games are just as unrelated to pokemon as that
kinda like the peta pokemon game?
exatly
*exactly
now I can not think about RoR and Cucumber for... a few hours. XD
Still not changing my opinion about the gens. :P
which they only did somthing about now instead of how many years ago
shadowboy8456: Don't forget the Mario debacle, too. :D
still not changing the fact thjat I dont need to change an uncorrect opinion
incorrect*
what mario debacle?
>Implying that your opinion is absolute :D
^
HIT THE WITCH! :D
cucumber?
shoot it!
Nope, his opinion is so wrong it breaks grammar
/me pokes Snow
Burn the Witch!
poor some water on the witch
convenient placed witch
shadowboy8456: The Tanooki Suit in Super Mario Land 3D.
oh,that?
Yeah, it's the testing thing we're using
Yep.
god I hate the witch >:3
Tricking you with her crying
Hi everyone :)
teool zoey
Ayejay shoosh, u r stewpid.
hey Lil_B
AJ, the difference is that im not stating an opinion, im stating a FACT
ello Lil_B
Don't we all, Mega_Milk? :D
troll
Lil_B: Sup.
Hi, Lil_B. :)
Dumbest syntax ever and makes everything take twice as long
:3
Hi Lil_B !
Um, no you're not, TheBadger.
You're stating what YOU consider a fact, Badger. :D
Um, yes I am, DWR
thanks Dken2021 LunasGuard Mega_Milk AJIsAwesome and Alchemist :)
I could easily go onto the official pokemon website and prove you that you're wrong.
I guess it's supposed to be used for letting your customers get involved in the development process, but it confuses me and I'm a programmer, so...
No, im stating something that has been an absolute in the pokemon community since 2001. AKA a fact
dayum
aww, L4D2... I would like to play with them
Ah, another Pokemon fan that's stuck in the past. :D
Um, no.
shizu would be an awsome snoiper on tf2
um, yes
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Aprons and Cookbooks!
AJIsAwesome: I swear my first time playing i heard a crying girl and though "Oh ma gerd, someone needs help and is still not infected!" Andran all the way over to find her and the jerk attacked me!!
brb,doing ultimate gamer challenge
More work for you then :/
Since we are talking about pokemon. http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MPdof2XKL._SL500_AA300_.jpg
yep, that happened
Yep.
AJIsAwesome Yeah, we'll always come across these type of people.
I can
*can't wait until this class is over
Well, seeing how some Pokemon were based off piles of gunk, pokeballs, sunflowers and etc. in Gen 1 and 2 doesn't really help your case Badger. :D
aprons? I'd totally get those, the epitone of manliness
Only another month and a half...
Guys, it's just an OPINION that murder is wrong. Obviously, that makes someone who states that it is wrong just another opinion
I'm seriously wondering what the fuck you are gaining out of this.
I'm going to get a terrible grade though because the professor can tell how much I don't like it >.>
Muk, based off piles of gunk. Electrode, based off a POKEBALL. Sunflora, based off a SUNFLOWER. Originality, what's that?
Joomay Entertainment.
:>
Not you chav.
i dont even know where this conversation is about.
I stoped watching pokemon when they started introducing new pokemon. I remember the exact episode I stoped watching, it was the episode where they are in the woods and some guy who makes pokeballs out of acorns and stuff.
I mean, you have to be INSANELY dumb to think that
I'd hate to have even started this conversation
When there are...
Logic flew out the wnidow.
I'm enjoying the fact that you seem that your opinions and beliefs are higher than everyone else's. :D
Rex_Mundi funny, last year, there was an article in a german Newspaper saying "Hacker Group , blah blah blah, with a blue Pokemon" and a picture of Rainbow Dash next to it :/
Is it going to screw up your graduation plan?
window*
/me popcorns
NullRadix: Pass the popcorn? :3
not unless I get below a C
not only logic Jmo
/me throws herself out the window
Lil_B: Obviously rainbow Dash is best Pokemon.
D:
/me shrugs, passes the popcorn and goes back to his work
I'm laughing about this. My jimmies aren't even rustled. :D
It's funny, im not TOO suproised by the stupidity, considering there are even people who refuse to believe the holocaust happened
Rex_Mundi appearently so xD
I hope I won't do that badly though because apparently last year there was a guy who got away with basically doing nothing in that class and still got a C
Wow.
You really have to bring that up when we're discussing Pokemon.
/me holds Snow
/me is playing with black magic
O.o
wtf...
PANDA!
You go from Pokemon to the Holocaust? I thought we were talking about Pokemon.
Snow, do not defenstrate yourself, okies?
/me glomps Panda|Drawing
How does he expect to get a job in that field then..
THe Holocaust had nothing to with this. :P
Well yeah, you have to be just as retarded and closed to the world to believe that there are more than 2 gens
^^
how are you hun?
pretty good
It's called senioritis :P basically everyone stops caring about school when they get to their final year
and you?
know what? let TheBadger belive what he belives, there's no reason at all to belittle him of it
And you have to be ignorant and closeminded to believe that there are 5 OFFICIAL generations of Pokemon. :D
Probably won't help him much in the job hunt though... =/
or argue about it
hehe ^^ pretty good, just glancing into the chat to rest my eyes xD
Dken2021: I'm not belittling, I'm just explaining my side.
agreed AJ.
finally you see reason
*that there AREN'T
ohey Panda|Drawing !
Lil_B ^^ hello there! How are you :3
Now that AJ has agreed with me, time to leave.
I think this discussion should be why ash hasnt aged, or why the show.
Good
pls go
Yeah probably not
Well, that happened. :D
Panda|Drawing so far so good :) and you?
O_O did I come back to a fight?
Make that, Joomay, u go 2
pls
Panda|Drawing: A pointless fight, at that. :P
How about you go roll in a ditch.
Lil_B ^^ good hehe just chillin'
kk
:>
Will do that tomorrow
This game
/me rolls Jmo in a ditch.
I love this game
So
Damn
Much
supposedly that's the reason the professor is always on our case
So we don't slack off like that guy did
There are 5 OFFICIAL gens of Pokemon. If you don't want to believe that, that's your problem. :P
im in a good mood even thou i went through my drawing yesterday with my eraser
He left, shush AJ.
He's gone, AJIsAwesome.
I know. :P
This was supposed to be a class where the students pretty much take the lead
Witnessing that made my brain cells suicide.
Snow :D what did you draw?
Just making a statement. :P
Brain cells? Joomay?
Jmo stop smoking weed then -__-
but nooooo we just _have_ to do everything his way
When did this happen?
You guys arguing over such a small thing.
Children. >_>
my pony oc antromorphic
Jmo: I wasn't arguing, I was explaining my argument. :D
Snow :D can I see?
again, I'd hate to have even caused that arguement, all I wanted was some help
*my side of the topic
'I wasn't aruging, I was explaining my argument'
cant, went through my drawing and it got ripped
You didn't think that over .-.
the next l4d should have zombie kids in it
Jmo: I changed my sentence. :P
Snow D: can I see your OC then? ^^
Jmo: I don't htink before I type sometimes. Sue me. :P
*think
I will
See, there I go again. :D
Joomay, you can't sue
u can't afford a lawyer
sure, hold on Panda
So you guys all have Zombie plans? Cus i have a zombie plan for my house and my school!'
too soon? http://derpy.me/xXOCn
I keep thinking he's saying Mama Tov's. :D
Mine's easy, watch everyone panic and kill trespassers.

My shops there always seem to be empty

Meanwhile: They also have to have about a house worth of weaponry and artillery
Hi J_E_Smith71 :3

it's like we need to rate animation with the seasons
Don't you have to pay the remaining balance at the end of the lease?

That very same guard now haunts Skyrim, possessing other guards to convey his last message to the Dragonborn. You may mock him, you may refuse to heed his call, you may even kill him, but there is one thing you must never do. Even if you are on the brink of madness, I beg of you!Never repeat that damned phrase.
thats how the creepypasta ends lol

cashiepasta
cachi01: you know there's a rule for that?
Dang I forgot to rip some Avatar dvds
ekips: red buttons usually kill others.

You know they have to put a warning on coffe cups to warn its hot?

Disney expects to more aggressively expand the Star Wars film schedule, Iger said in a statement. Following the release of Episode 7 in 2015, "our long term plan is to release a new Star Wars feature film every two to three years," Iger said.

twilight_sprinkle: no damnit boy dont do it

08,01with the intention of touring

08,01that is, doing loooong cycle runs
08,01Serenity: closer to £1000
Well looks like I need to fix my Join Avenue
Dammit
So, is ValtheJean a tank?

Kandarihu: yup
Meanwhile says "I'm batman" umglolwut

Batman can breath in space
08,01NullRadix: aye; i used to cycle 30 miles a day to get into work (altogether, not each way)
I thought Kermit was the Batman.
I'm also Kermit.
$1300 on a bike?
Mods are domination tonight
I'll probably key a 'ped when I'm 16
A winner is you!

08,01Lunar_Brony: well, it was more like £800 all in all
SpadeMagnes[School]: I have chortles!
Obsidian: Wait 'till they play a team that's not really bad.
Meanwhile: Or me
You are Winner
Obsidian: kinda they flopped the 1st stage
Youre winner
You dead
Serenity: I said a team that wasn't bad.
08,01£600 for the bike, another few hundred for accessories, including about £70 for a lock
PANTS in Concert
08,01i think that's about right
I would stream Big Rigs right now if I could
I'd probably fail so hard, that I would dominate knowing my crazy luck
wait wait
AJIsAwesome: lol how have you been?
Dare I say it, Sonic 06 is more finished than Big Rigs
I've been good, brony2447. How about you? :)
SpadeMagnes[School]: You'd be right.
SpadeMagnes[School]: t'is true
Also It makes me sad that the 06 demo is better than the finished product
AJIsAwesome: ive been good too i hand-drew some new ponies and i am really pleased with them
08,01wait, i think i'm getting muddled
Ohhhhh mahgosh you gotta tell me ERRTHING about it :D
brony2447: Hooray! :)
WOO bumpah carz
08,01it may have actually been £800 for the bike, and £1000 in total after all
get the gnome
AJIsAwesome: lol thx :) :)
Get a plushie :P
08,01Serenity: i cycled it home :D
08,01
Also apperently no one proof reads the Sonic 06 manuals
So you saved 99p, which you could spend on a nice bottle of drink
"Super Sonic obatin the all moves." WUT.
what does it say in there SpadeMagnes[School]
SpadeMagnes[School] no one put any effort into the game. Why would they put effort into the manual?
alexxm: Sonic has a energy meter
It was SUPPOSED to drain when he used gems
It doesnt
GOTTA GO FAST
I need more friends on steam
SONIC'S THE NAME SPEED'S MY GAME

SpadeMagnes[School]: Don't you mean, popanutritious?
damn this brings back fond memories of playing this with my dad
08,01i was going to spend a lot on a racing bike, but the guy at the shop advised me to get a cross instead, which would be better for touring, but performs more like a road bike than a hybrid
AJIsAwesome: no
I would be on here all day if it was possible
08,01and i'm very, very happy with my bike
just to clear my mind,
AJIsAwesome you want to play some L4D2 with me?
it's a touring bike?
Dont your normally order a chillidog?
*you
DerpyMuffins: I don't have it. :D
My bicycle is an old BMX. It was not made for long distances. It was made for stunts. Although I never used it for stunts.
08,01i'm not a very material person, but there are two things i own that i'm very very posessive over: my bike and my cello

Nope
DerpyMuffins, worked for me. Especially after I turned all the settings down to minimum.

So... anyone else hear the sad news?
Nittany_Discord: where do you work at?
Hai [SWAG]Haku
[SWAG]Haku, about Disney and Star Wars?
[SWAG]Haku: you'll have to be more specific
YES
^^
Ponies47_: You are the best derp :3
Disney and star wars
^^^*
did meanwhile finally lick an electrical outlet?
11,01It's a election group. Not going to get into details.

Disney... and Star Wars
well Disney has Marvel and I haven't seen any crossover
[SWAG]Haku: dont remind me
Ponies47_: A+ again :3
hey GUYS
did you KNOW
Nittany_Discord^^ im glad u got it
Disney... and the new trilogy they plan on making
there's a doctor who star trek crossover????
Nittany_Discord: Well that sucks about the stream but good luck tomorrow and get some rest
[SWAG]Haku oh sweet Celestia what has this world become . . .

gtg, see y'all later!
I'll be back . . .

Really, though, the Marvel movies really make me have mixed feelings about this.
cya Lunar_Brony|AFK
Because they prove that Disney can make some badass movies...
Bye Lunar_Brony|AFK :)
Hey
but como on... Its Star Wars
Hasbro owns Wizards of the Coast
It finished perfectly
they havent ruined them
bye Lunar_Brony|AFK
Hm
This chat is quiet.
I like it.
11,01Obsidian, Master-Derps, oni_link, and RoboGerbil. I'm going to call the stream because it's late for me and playing another round will run me too late.
So no stream tonight?
/me sits down and meditates
does no one realize that starwars has been completly crap for years?
alright nitt, sleep well mate
11,01I apologize for this. We'll play on stream another day.
Nittany_Discord: We're startiong a game anyway
floof
Have a good night Nittany_Discord
11,01OK Obsidian.
night, nitt. dream of ponies tonight :)
emangamer that is your opinion, and it's only because of the prequels, which arent as bad as people say they are.
i personally didnt mind the prequels tbh
Its fine Nittany_Discord
[SWAG]Haku: no, because they have squeeses every ounce of money out of the franchize possible, making ANY series bad
Like Hasbro does with all of their stuff?
[SWAG]Haku: wrong
they havent done that with magic
or mlp
Im pretty sure Im not
its business
get use to it
magic is EXTREMELY well managed
here's hoping hasbro dont eff thing up too much with mlp
0,5MAHGICKS
but then again, hasbro doesnt manage them directly
well, even if they do. we still have our fandom at least :)
night night everypony

rest well spud
Night, spud. :)
night, spud. dream of ponies tonight :)
Night spud :)
Goodnight spud :)
And yet the sad truth is that it's the 5th reincarnation of a kids show that was only made to promote kids toys
Good night, spud and Nittany
As awesome as it is
Nittany_Discord: why does a freakishly massive and large elephant want you to go to bed.
Yeah, they got lucky this time.
Well I gotta cut on processes while running L4D apparantly
[SWAG]Haku: MAGIC, perfect example of not squeesing every penny out of it
See you all later tonight
11,01Don't know emangamer. I guess it loves me.
See you, oni_link
they make it because players demand it
Nittany_Discord: why do you even have an FMLE
thats because the target audience was children, and maybe us
those are ex[ensive
and they eat a lot
speaking of magic
11,01Don't know, but I'm selling it.
I am back!
yikes
11,01I know Derpy_Hooves.

Hello?
I am back :3
to quote the late otakon
And nothing of value was gained.
It was an awesome toy line made tv show made franchise made Hit Movie Trilogy
GODDAMMIT DARI BOT
That was Wrek's bot.
/me glomps sonicdude558 :3
Well this is odd
I'm not late
Oh dear god.
I wasn't kicked
Thank you thelonepony
Point is that Star Wars was bad ass enough to create such a long running series of stuff
and WHO is that emangamer?
/me kicks otakon
/me in the shins
gtg. laters
It's successful because people like it, and people want it
/me kicks emangamer in the daddybag.
bye thisguy take care
otakon: why do you hate my backpack my fatehr gave me?
how about them 100 plushies I gave you?
emangamer: XD
So Star Wars if Disney directed it. Will it be a reboot?
Wait, I mean PRODUCED it.
New tirlogy
I will take 99 of those plushie back.
Disney is making a SEQUEL TRILOGY
not a reboot
Oh wow. So no Darth Vader :S
Hm
So basically
/me could not give any less of a shit about star trek
Not much going on here.
and they are all mine. MINE! ALL MINE
i mean star wars
Reikim: Nope.
emangamer OUT
All right.
13i thought everyone knew it was intended to be 9 films
/me breaks yet another window and hops out
because he FELT THE TRILOGY ENDED THE STORY PERFECTLY.
Well that's 4.05 billion dollars thrown around.
Shizuka, really? I never heard about the plan for 9 movies.
I believe that was sarcasm
The Stores and comics and everything else told the aftermath of the original trilogy, and he want to keep it to those
Shizuka: aah, the old, make the middle 3, then the first 3, then wait 10 years to make the last 3 scheme...I forgot about that old trick
Shizuka: what movie?
Shizuka: oh Star Wars
Star Wars otakon
On another note, it seems GTA V is going to be released in spring.
Clearly this was always the plan.
dammit I look away for 1 mintue and I lose the converstation
Make part 4 5 and 6.
Meanwhile: OF COURSE!
otakon: no, george of the jungle
Make parts 1 2 and 3 when you have access to better cgi.
Sell series to Disney.
Let them make the rest of it.
emangamer: yeah well you've missed a BUNCH of stuff in regulars that you would find hilarious
Give it a happy ending, too.
inb4 musical numbers
Also, MAGIC.
otakon: I doubt it
I can see it now, EWOKS singing with a princesss
Pirates didn't have musical numbers.
Star Wars 6 HAD a happy enging, as long as you stay within the movies and not wander into the entended universe
and they give them big eyes too
♫ So why do you waste my time!? Is the Answer... ♫
Well Disney and Lucaus arts were already pretty close. i
08,01people, people
08,01how many times do i need to tell you

otakon precisely, so why make a movie out of it?
Hellow AJIsAwesome

Pfffft. I'll stick with TF2 thank you very much!
here's a scary thought
portal is an FPS
k
oh
/me hugs his imaginary twi plushie and throws it behind him, turning into air
goddamn NEXT game isn't out yea they already talk about the next one
^
portal is a FPPTS
that's because NO ONE likes treyarch
treyarch sucks
did you PLAY WaW
first person portal thinking simulator
emangamer: but its not a shooter, so id say first person view
superretroworld: you shoot portals
therefore shooter
oh yeah
Yeah, it's a fresh spin on the genre
emangamer: zombies is what makes treyarch so awesome

Can anyone salvage the Star Wars storyline?
Episode 7, I don't know, could be good, just stop with the Anakin
Shizuka: ask LadyCanary for tips to make a costume on a budget
The sun always rises on Disney.
Make it about Luke again
13there is no budget
13unless you can make a costume for negative moneys
The budget is: dust.
The storyline isn't that bad, the prequels just ruined it for everyone
BaconMane: like i said, its an april fools day 'winks eye'
Nope.
My dad's reaction to hearing about episode 7 PRICELESS! XD
ep 7 = spinoff with chewbacca and mickey mouse

Shizuka: shitty ......oh God NO

SWEET CELESITA NO SHIZUKA!
superretroworld: I also went to school last Thursday with a pony shirt on. And I've been watching ponies before my typing class starts and then shortly after it finshes. Just a quick clip and then log off :P
13they lock the main movies in their "vault" for a decade at a time
TAKE IT BACK!
Shizuka: STOP IT!STOPITNOW!
13then release it as a special edition
Shizuka
Shizuka, gotta get that Diamond Edition

13AND
13THEN
Shizuka:
STAHP
13it's under copyright for a minimum of 95 years
This is making me laugh :D
13and disney being disney

Ponies47: what did they say?

08,01and also the Despecialised Editions
08,01my god, those things
08,01so awesome
See, I do like Star Wars, but I find it to be overrated.
Rainbow Dash askes, "Have you ever snorted powdered lightning?"
i've got a laserdisk copy of the lion king
The Despecialised Editions are just as bad as the Special Editions
As in, people make it out to be the greatest thing ever.
its awesome :3
superretroworld: They just starred at me and I was all like "Deal with it" B)
Polydunami: same
on the other hand DEATH STAR VS GALACTUS! Who's the faster Planet Destroyer special edition motion comic
08,01mitamaking: how?
They are a fan making changes he sees fit
Ponies47: awsome. id love to do that sometime, but to shy
The fastest planet destroyer is the DEATH STAR! ...With a moustache.
VenHur, with a top hat and monocle
superretroworld: Don't be shy :3
Mutterguy: at the end mickey mouse will appear and will start singging its a small world after all and galactus and the empire will hug
ASoftFluffyThing, when a mommie and a daddy love each other very much...
ASoftFluffyThing: you see when 2 planets like each other and wanna have a baby planet....
...Call it Death EGG instead of Death STAR and there you go.
08,01mitamaking: but they're as close to the theatrical releases as you can get; they are better than any other edition in my opinion
cachi01 that has yet to happen with marvel
13BUT WAIT
13THERE'S MORE
D:
08,01Shizuka is making us all sad

08,01Shizuka: oh oh! i know this game! CGI Alec Guinness!
kinixys, again, you forgot again
I could get behind a new Ewoks cartoon, I like the old one
no offence to fans but i think theres enough star wars by now
Over reacting much?

/me hugs Ponies47
DeadpoolDash: i agree, tbh
DeadpoolDash: BURNNNNNNN

http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
A new myst movie sounds like a money spinner for Wellington
DeadpoolDash, yes they can
My right arm feels funny....
they can put in a random musical number in it :)
SpadeMagnes[School]: thats for clopping all day
superretroworld: It's fine. I don't care if people judge me over the fact I like ponies. They can deal with it -hugs back- Atleast I got you guys :3
SpadeMagnes[School]: so stop clopping
DeadpoolDash: Besides Marvel fans were worried too, and then: Avengers
they can put in someone WORSE than Jar jar binks
does anybody think they'll have songs in the star wars sequel?
Master-Derps: :D we where spamming that in class the other day! :P
Hey Avengers was good
because apparently We have good scenery
superretroworld: disney
They can have Sinbad star in it :)
I just love how people forget that Disney produced movies that are serios
*serious
er Colt_Brovakiin in not even talking :)
Shizuka: Lots of ewoks you say? Wonder if we'd see more stuff like this *shudder*: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt0GaIBMIs
It is insulting
I mentioned Pirates of the Caribbean before. Nopony noticed.
Master-Derps: Sorry I tab faild :P my bad
J_E_Smith71: I like that show

what about Tangled?
Though I prefered the first theme myself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8bqcoqfYds
13Polydunami: shh let us wax emo over the doomed fate of star wars :2
ill just go back to hiding in the list of names

Ponies47: thats always true :). but i have non brony friends that are okay with me being one, so give it a chance
Well yeah, but it's kind of there.
Oh good god you people...
Star Wars will be fine Shizuka have some faith that Disney likes money
but the Horse was awesome
superretroworld: I've been trying to make friends. It's not working :<
Besides, Disney and Star Wars brought us this http://youtu.be/UdbajvVROjc
At lest ROtS was decent...
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Wallpaper Compilation #70
Maybe Disney will have crazy Star Wars dance numbers in the movies. They already do at Disney World during Star Wars Weekends: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsrbQK9kgQg
DeadpoolDash: is he gangnam styling???

Night everyone and thanks for the strema NewSpookyBronyU :3
my math teacher was the best teacher i ever had. he got so angry when someone cant solve something simple(for him), he would yell so loud you could hear him throughout the school. but he genuinely wanted us to do good, and he kne math very well
Audible Gasp!
i liek my english teacher :$
My high school teacher was strict, but she could be VERY nice. She's been my favorite teacher, next to my math teacher.
11,02Every English teacher acted like they were out of touch with reality and graded every assignment like their opinions were 1:1 with the author of each book.

What's odd is that I wasn't a huge fan of this show while I was in grade school, but now I find it pretty amusing :)
My Biology teacher taught us nothing. She dropped the final test on us and whispered "Put the grade you think you made on the topright of the sheet of paper"
Lunar_Brony: get this, I have a job and the money to afford an actual connection to the internet now without aping it off the neighbors(whose signal is weak and fluctuates) however my mom says "Why bother when we get it for free?" She doesn't want me to get us proper internet and it'a aggravating as hell.
11,02J_E_Smith71: I'll play some after a chapter of Uncharted 3 o3o
Ah, not another update...
Everyone copied off of me in civics ._.
13flutter_spin: so all the Dunning Kruger kids put down As, all the inferiority complex kids put down Fs
Oh, wait....never mind.
So does anyone have any suggestions as to convince my mother that we should get proper internet?
13otakon1: cat videos, endless endless cat videos
^
Dont argue with your parents. Its too much work...
Shizuka: she doesn't get on the net for anything but business
and ponies
dont forget the ponies
yeesh. I'm still trying to avoid fixing my mom's computer. She finally got on it after 2 years and it worked for 2 hours.
she doesn't watch it like we do
otakon1: Reliability?
Ew ponies? Gay.
13it will keep you out of trouble
otakon1: Whatever she likes, tell her about something cool relating to it that the internet has
I liek cats.
kinixys: yeah she doesn't care if it randomly goes down either.
So thisn't the porygon episode?
But anyways they went over to some guy passing by and said "Hey could you take this into that club?" and gave him the prostectic leg. They went to a parking lot across from the club and watched the guy go in...and quickly ran out as a bunch of cops chased him
And fellow Bronies I am back
Petrified_Discord: she likes work
otakon1: Google docs.
otakon1: Security?
Mutterguy, porygon episode was japanese only
hmmm maybe
otakon1: Or google drive
kinixys: that too
What I miss?
Mutterguy, also this isnt pokemon
GreenPony: just starting Uncharted 3
otakon1: REally? Huh..
I wished Naghty Dog gets the Crash Bandicoot franchise back from Activision...
flutter_spin: This game is awesome!
11,02"If you're not supposed to abuse cough syrup why does it come with a little plastic shot glass?" -Bill Murray
I asked that only because of the epilepsy warning
...One of these damn days, it WILL happens.
Mutterguy, funnily enough, an english dub of the infamus seisure episode was produced and actually aired in australia
i saw it many years ago
VenHur: I grew up with Crash! And Spyro, and Gex
okay what the FUCK now my signal has dropped to under .20mbps and a 300ms ping
the FUCK
not sure if any copys still exist
GreenPony: Yeah. It's the game where anyone can mistake it as a very long movie
NewSpookyBronyU because cough syrup is fucking disgusting
otakon1, mobile
?
I heard it was pikachu's fault
otakon1: Someone probably walked in front of the router.
Phase4: no this is wifi, my neighbors. my mom doesn't want to get actual internet
I mean, sure, Uncharted is great...but who wanted to see a GOOD Crash game since Twinsanity?
Mutterguy, yes and no, pickachu used thunderbolt on some missles, which caused almost fullscreen red/blue flashing
flutter_spin: Yeah, looks like a movie, but better
bc we've got access to my neighbors
Mutterguy: No Pikachu shocked some missles and the explosion caused the bright flashes
otakon1, ah
it fucking sucks
I don't know about convincing her for proper Internet.
Sorry ota.
I need to convince her that we need proper internet for reiliability and security
Phase4: i saw the flashing bit on youtube, it really was unpleasant for the eyes
Good luck with that!
The first game my family got was for my sister, it was my little pony
Mutterguy, there was actually a fair ammount of research done, photosensetivie seizures are aparently triggered real easy by red/blue oscilations
PUSH
I mean god's sake it's only 50 bucks a month
I can afford that
lawl
Hiro: You was one lucky hell of a bastard.
Someone should play LittleBigPlanet2
50? I get it for less.
My mom can't afford that, but somehow she still can't pay the bills. Must be because she takes a vacation every 4 months.
dat phobia
this movie has poor cgi
Hush, this movie is great!
/me sigh
All we need is... well nevermind
o.o
/me Stays silent for the rest of the film
13why is desmond fighting sandman?
what the
press triangle to advance the movie
Shizuka: he's freaking out from a hallucinigne
punching a brick wall.
13>priceless artifacts
Man that song was good
13>let's just smash them all up
hey
Quick! Add snakes!
13this is Fahrenheit right?
no this is patrick
"charlie, we can get through this" *punch*
You mean Indigo Prophecy
13the game made of 100% quick time events
twilight_sprinkle: awesome.
Shizuka, nah, its drakes quicktime adventure
13Phase4: yeah i know his pain, once you install quicktime it's hard to get rid of
Shizuka that's all the Uncharted series has ever been, and always will be
Johnny boy.
13wiat where did these two come from
XD
SHOOT HIM
theres actually quite a bit of non quick time events parts of this game
13why didn't they help earlier?
Shizuka game logic
13WHAT YEAR IS IT
Is that his twin brother's skull behind him?
Shizuka: 1945
Shizuka: lol they just caught up and it's 2012
seems legit
13also we should watch jumanji
13get on that will you ponies?
No, no...
Didn't we already stream Jumanji?
We need more lemon pledge
lol
like a rabbit dog
wabbit
I remember watching Jumanji when I was 3. Scared the living shit outta me.
13tell me about the rabbits george
Wabbit season
well crap
drop the torch :)
my usb adapter keeps crapping out
clear violation of the building code
and a few years later I saw the less-than-adequate remake Zathura
and then draugr
Phase4: no OSHA Compliance
how does turn wheel
or something along those lines
13THRILL as the player character struggles with simple machines!
spin the globe?
yeah, Zathura. Jumanji in space
dat fire XD
Uncharted 3: The Ultimate Challenge? VALVE PUZZLES!
Shizuka: So, almost every adventure/puzzle game?
running animation needs work
hi Cades
MY BACK IS ON FIRE
Woody run
13i think they have a cream for that now
great. Now I have "apply directly to the forehead" commercial in my mind
it's been way to quiet today
its a good thing this ancient civilization not only knew the earth was round but had an accurate enough map to construct a globe
13and the tools to do it
i bet they were aliens
made of glass
Well, they were smarter then everyone else?
yeah...
flutter_spin: man, I hate that commercial SO much
Ive been busy as usual irl :/
lol
yeah same
Shizuka, actually yeah, where did they get the tools
So...Uncharted = Mordern Day Indiana Jones/Laren Croft
Also, anyone familiar with the E.T game for Atari 2600?
plus those gears
By the looks of it too, my leave of absence might be sooner than i think
he runs funny
need a lathe to make gears right
oh :(
hardly complicated but still needs a bit of knowledge
woho!

GreenPony: Oh, that game. It's the greastes game I'd ever seen! >_>

13i didn't know we finally had this technology
11,02o3o
Shizuka, blasphemy

must have been a bug
VenHur: Well you can worry no longer, as I have found a copy of the game, played it for 1 minute, drowned it in lighter Fluid, and set it on fire in my furnace
we've had it since Jak and Daxter
13shouldn't you have had to reload the entire game to go back two minutes?
I just got disconnected from the chat, I couldn't get back in for a minute or so, and my other nick is "in use." This is the second time this happened to me in 3 days. WTF is going on?
there was not a hint of its existance left O_O
you touched the spiders and live!
guys! check xkcd now!
13Canadian_Brony: standard issue pingout, just ghost your nick
Majick torches
VenHur: lol close,its Rick Taylor from the Splatterhouse series

Canadian_Brony, its 250 seconds btw
Splatterhouse was awesome
the old ones I mean <_<
spoiders
they're after you
Phase4 thank. Any particular reason why I couldn't get back in for 250 seconds?
Phase4: Its a conspiracy man!
*thanks
So SpookyBrony, ever thinking of playing all the Jak games (expect Daxter on the PSP) chronologically?
Aright, I have to go. gotta sleep for work
g'night GreenPony
bye GreenPony
latas Pony who is Grean
GreenPony: i liked the 2010 ver,some bugs but i think its fun :)
The spiders want your... I can't say it.
Canadian_Brony, yeah, your nick was in use, notmally people just use a different nick, like adding _ to the end
green*
And be prepared for a WTF plot twist in Jak 3...
13Canadian_Brony: IRC server sends a PING message to your client every few seconds, client sends back a PONG
Bye-Bye
Daxter was pretty fun on the PSP
o btw Phase4 , i was thinking you might want to add time zone to !cd
why are the walkways disentergrated but the fires still full of wood
HOW THE HELL DID YOU GET UP HERE?
First game I got for it
13if the server doesn't receive a PONG for 250 seconds (depending on the network), it assumes you're dead and releases your connection
NIght, GreenPony :)
Night everypony
13Phase4: more importantly why do they have infinite torches
Phase4 -_(\ not the ghosting problem. I was disconnected as Lunar_Brony and failed to reconnect even as Canadian_Brony.
Oh THAT one spins
Canadian_Brony, really strange
Must not think of Amnesia. Must not.

twilight_sprinkle, but i'll bug the person who makes it
Canadian_Brony, strange
Phase4: okay thanks :)
Wow dynamic lighting!
I hope it works. Be one short game.
those rocks must have some enormous friction
I remember when I had to choose between framerate or dynamic lighting.
Kurra: i dont have to choose, its 800x600 minimum or no go
the spinny sphere rock thing works irl, but the rocks have to be polished
that rock is clearly not polished
IKR? Has this ever happened before? I didn't lost stream connection, and I'm sitting beside my modem, so it can't be my internet.
yeah ive heard of the polished thing, but they are Not polished
also drake must be super buff to move it like that
or it somehow happens to be extremely light
i wonder if they have an ancient video game somewhere in that dungeon
just match the dots with the holes
but it's a video game
so it doesn't matter
But spinning that bad boy is hard.
Phase4: ist being pushed up by water
p4ngya, it could be frictionless for all i care, still about a tonn of rock to rotate
/me pokes chat
what game is this?
Hey! That tickles.
Uncharted 3
Maybe its hollow?
what is that noise
what's up with the sound all of a sudden

NewSuperBronyU: try and line up the light on the left with Australia

oh then that was the sound of the universe tearing NewSuperBronyU
Silly filly..
lol universe tearing. I like that.
11,02I'm watching the game on my TV while my computer is capturing the gameplay. I muted the audio on my computer to listen on the TV.

All better :3

You watching the game on your .. oh ... football or something?

I seen the news report on the TV and god damn, New Jersey looked like a wasteland.
VenHur: really?
VenHur: And then the Fire nation attacked
She detects a draft. lol.
flutter_spin no, he's using a capture card to play the game on his TV and transfer it to his computer where it is then sent to us as stream
VenHur indeed, looks like 2012 or a horror movie or Gettysburg or....
HoodyVorheez: And then the Water Tribe retaliated

Since it's Wednesday for East and Central coast peoples, Happy Halloweeen!

I've had snow for almost a week.
And it's pissing me off!
/me wishes he had some snow here in California ;~;

Who's streaming and what game is this?
I shoveled a driveway that contains a large, uneven crack at every metre AND it sits on a hill!
ASoftFluffyThing: NewSuperBronyU and uncharted 3
oh and hello ASoftFluffyThing
13all the guys i know call me crazy when i tell them they could wear tights and extend shorts season by a good three weeks
13keeps your legs warm :)
I did it THREE TIMES since the first snowfall, and last time took me 2 hours.
Hai flutterchu *huggles*
but Shizuka mean in tights is only for Robinhood
13nuh uh
You just wanna see their packages, Shizuka :P
13guys are just afraid of being pretty
Also, one does not know cold until they walk in -25 celcius weather fr a week.
*for
But I don't like tights. ;~;
13Lunar_Brony: oh please, two miles to school in driving snow at... what's -20F in C
13-28C
Shizuka: Slightly chilly, I see.
. . . how much is a mile in KM?
133.2km
3 kliks . . . holy crap
For NZ and Oz that sounds alien. the concept that you could just turn off the freezer and leave every thing in the garage...
welp
13and i did that every weekday for... about three months, dead of minnesota winter
13and there's a sort of valley between here and school
This really grinds my gears
13so i can honestly say i walked two miles to school in the snow uphill both ways
inb4 dern kids
Shizuka, wanna know what's worse?
13gas prices
Funny you should say ythat
Triangle to find the corner piece

Phase4: awesome, but whats UTC :D
universal time
13x y in z where x is your quantity and y and z are the units
that's what I'm doing
edd, I usually set the ep channel up on my 32 inch, and have the chat on my smaller monitor
you lost the girl
13and it's perfectly happy to take $1/L in $/gal and put out the answer :3
UMC=GMT Phase4 ?

PLAY ASSASSIN's CREED III
So, the HUB uploaded the first 5 minutes of season 3 to YouTube, but then Hasbro took it down because of copyright. Trolls?
/me snuggles Jmo44
Damn keyboard is shorting again >>
13Phase4: UTC adds leap seconds i believe, it replaces UTC but for everyday use is functionally the same
edd it was 8 minutes
half of what they posted was the "Failure song"
ah
shhhhhhhh
they had shown us earlier
<<
hm ok
SpeccyRush|Drawing: Technically it was 5, since the intro is about 3
/me nuzzles ASoftFluffyThing

11,02Assassin's Creed III isn't out yet :<
Evil Celestia? Pish Posh
eddmario: it's NewSuperBronyU
there is no evilestia
it made me jump
NewSuperBronyU: uh yes it is
It isn't?
NewSuperBronyU, yes it is.
good lord
Of all the characters to turn evil, she is literally the last that comes to mind
11,02not on Wii U :<
Even Fluttershy is more likely to turn to the dark side
11,02Which is the definitive version :)
I don't know if it's considered spoilers, but is mentioning that a certain character reappers during the first few minutes count as one?
that's why its so scary
13is it out on PC? steam still says november
they found all the thu'ums
yes so shutup with the talkin

hey guys whatcha think of my art?

SeaponiesofLiverpool: it's starry starry night
Dr. flutterstein
like Frankenstein
ya don't say
I'm getting a very Burn Notice vibe right now. I guess because the guy with the red shirt reminds me of Bruce Campbell
totally something Fluttershy would do
The version of Frankenstein I read had him grow the monster in a tube
Shizuka you pay ~$1 per litre for gas, and up here, we pay $1.32 per litre.
welp gonna go see if I can find ACIII lets play on youtube
I kinda like that version better
13Lunar_Brony: well actually
cheap he says
cheap for u
Lunar_Brony: You think it's CHEAP?!?!? It's considered expensive here.
13check $4.10/gal in $/L
unless I did my conversions wrong . . .
and dead
eddmario lol now i wanna Bruce as Sully in an Uncharted movie :D with Nate's VA *just like the Michael cm*
again
13california's up that high i think
foreign gas is always cheaper due to different wage standards
I hate the goddamn combat in these guns
11,02It's about $4.39 here
^
13ouch much higher
Shizuka: and thats just for regular?
13yep
we get USA gas and the price goes up because we have to pay minimum wage, etc.
13up here the nonregulars have been above $4 since... probably 08
11,02Hey, at least it doesn't cost the same as ink, which is like $2,000 a gallon
well im off 2 bed night everypony :)
sucks for anyone that needs premium
only $1.15 per litre in California
13i think the stations have all been reluctant to break $4 for regular
11,02Night Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
you have cheap gas
compared to us, anyways
you DIED
11,02o3o
13so we were peaking about $3.98 in minnesota, but that's starting to come down quick, think it's around $3.24 now
Bye Sketch_Toku_Brony
the average here is 3.535
$4 in July 2008
in dollars
It is getting rather gassy in here, isn't it? :P
Winter gas is cheaper
NIght, Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
Polydunami: *facehoof*
Shizuka: its amazing that there was a gas shortage in the 70'sand yet it was around a dollar still then
SB64 do you have ACIII?
GRAVITY FALLS MARATHON
time for GRAVITY FALLS MARATHON
So what sparked this conversation? :3
Now that I think about it, everything in the US is cheaper. Most of our prices are monitered by the governemt, except gas.
xD
11,02SeaponiesofLiverpool: No :/
y?
13SpeccyRush|Drawing: inflation :3
time for GRAVITY FALLS MARATHON

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music of the Day #15
11,02Cause I'm not a fan of Assassin's Creed...plus the system I would get it on isn't out yet :)
13but yeah i saw an article a week or two ago that we should expect gas prices to drop maybe 50 cents by the end of the year, i forget quite why
13something about the reserves building up from everyone being broke over the summer i think
I was talking about Gravity Falls
NewSuperBronyU: Audio out of synch.
Polydunami Shizuka and I were comparing life styles, and that somehow got into gas.
That ax in Bill's head
13where in canada btw
Polydunami basically, yes.
Shizuka BC
13oh over there

13Earlier this year, OLPC workers dropped off closed boxes containing the tablets, taped shut, with no instruction. “I thought the kids would play with the boxes. Within four minutes, one kid not only opened the box, found the on-off switch … powered it up. Within five days, they were using 47 apps per child, per day. Within two weeks, they were singing ABC songs in the village, and within five months, they had hacked Android,” Negroponte said.

11,02Panda: Bigger is better.
Brony2447: 8cool sounds good
(Insert inuendo here)
00,10I won it at the checkcashing drawing on my free spin.
NewSpookyBronyU: unless it's cancer...
11,02I tried the controller and probably the only thing I didn't like about it was the feeling of my two thumbs farther away on the controller than normal.
therainbowvortex: i think isaiah asked about it they are silversun pickups (sspu(
*)
hey dude you guys made some changes here on the chat? cause theres a security report thing on my screen here
NewSpookyBronyU: you would probably get used to that after a while
odl guys

Brony2447: oh yer he did he sent me a cool song by them

11,02Moopy: Yesh ;3;
wow
DeathStar, yeah... it would be good if all the companies werent in competition...
no it wouldnt
competition makes them get better
i wonder if the controller could play music and read .pdfs? I COULD REPLACE MY iPad!!!
11,02Did you know that the development team for the Wii U was completely shocked when Iwata announced the NFC feature for the Wii U Gamepad when they only just touched upon the feature a few days before the announcement.
hey guys, let's make brown and Bloom Rooty Tooty Point N' Shooty 7658: More Guns Edition
this is the future of video games
http://i.imgur.com/3g4iK.jpg
Buytoast: nahh just get borderlands 2
11,02They also had an emergency meeting before Wii U due to streaming issues with the new controller and worked around the clock to fixing it in time.
11,02E3*
but borderlands 2 is just as bad
Buytoast, nope. its the future for crappy games
i don;t want to play LE REDDIT THE GAME
Buytoast did you just call that game... bad?
some wonderful games are coming, because people are realizing that those games suck
i feel like 4chan will eventually abuse this mass communication through wii somehow...
00,10did you know the wii U controler was actaly developed by sega as a new handheld before they went under
i used to le be a le vault hunter like le you, but then i le took a le arrow to le knee XDDD
I'd believe that, Sumica
11,02Game Gear 2?
Gotta Sink Fast
http://i.imgur.com/3g4iK.jpg
11,02I think probably the most interesting fact about the system is that it was suppposed to come out in 2011.
11,02But due to development issues with the controller, it had to be delayed.
Its going to be a long night..
SB when someone talks crap about wii
http://cdn.cinemagr.am/cine_1/20591143.gif
11,02Although Nintendo didn't say it officially, just knowing that Rayman Origins was originally developed for the Wii U pretty much prooves the fact.
dramaric pug O_O
hey what if happens if i click the security report thing on my screen here at the top right of the screen thats under the minimize and the close window?
*dramatic
"if you want to piss somebody off, you no longer have to cuse them out, just draw a dick, and send them the pic"|
