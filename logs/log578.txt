INBOUND BEST SCENE OF THE MOVIE!!!!
Run, Forrest, Run! Wait, wrong movie...
Shame he died:|
Not one of them could hit him from 50ft away with rifles. Damn the future can suck

Nemo?

This show was incredibly popular back in Japan. It's pretty much the basis for an anime called Welcome to the NHK.
-.(
this would be me the one excited for technology
Child.....REEEEEEN....
Children...
B-4
this is more realistic. they arent freaking out over some children in the sub, they are just "sigh" kids....
I used to like a girl name nadia...
Seriously that reminds me of the Egg Carrier
How fast is a Knot anyway?
I used to like a girl named Nadia too. But then I grew out of being obsessed with anime :3
OWCH.
My connection is crapping out on me...
"Even when I was a child I would hit myself for being a child!"
so...fast?
Or was it 30 meter per minute
Hulllaaa
This is gonna be a trap
something makes me think she's lying about the no-danger thing
How is a seamonster metal?
The knot (pronounced not) is a unit of speed equal to one nautical mile (1.852 km) per hour
"You should always be nice to strangers" ....wat...

GAH

OMG NOOOOOOOOOO
:(
It was total bullshit
You know, calling these guys KKK isn't that far off, now that I think about it.
The only logical explanation to Satoshi still being 10 years old is assuming that all of his adventures took place in the span of less than one year.
dont cry little kid *pets*
I've seen this in old anime catalogs
5!
These guys are pretty much the Nazis of the show.
11,02This is the first time I'm seeing this either :3

well i wrote this http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&search=Day+Z
120hz monitors are expen$ive
its not that great in my opion but ehh
Basially, a bunch of random characters from different shows and movies and books are appeaering in equestria
Not many people right now though
And also Boba Fett
Boba Fett is awesome
That list should still exist, but it's a bit buried within the site news.
I could post the link. I saved it.

well actually i remember RioGascar being quite popular everyone said i got the personalities down
Naruto met those Fairies and they let him sign the Kaiju Summoning Contract.
oh
lol wut
It ends before the Chuunin Exam Arena Match.
And then Naruto summons GOdzilla and is crowned Kings of kages?
Cya AO
I had three naruto stories going beofre I discontinued them all
My first was a NAruto/Demonata cross over
lol
My 3rd was by far my most popular
I canceled it after the 4 chapter i think
Even wrote several "IZ/Disney" crossovers
well, more like "IZ/Disney songs" corssoevrs
It sorta does
They were all really just songfics
they be raped
ZATR
;)
I ship it
Then I like ZAGF
Eh, I never like Gaz
err...Mishia*
I prefered it when she wasnt in a story
One of the best ZATR stories Ive evr read is called "Kill Zim"
The Rebellion was supposed to play a larger role too. But the series was canceled.
just saying another nonon in FIM no Alicorns it really pisses them off
sadly, yes we do
:<
dat money
I was also thinking of putting both Zim and Tak into my sotry
Put some ZATR in it to confuse the fans
My story is not good, it is the opposite of good
/me hugs back

Madoka is best Fluttershy :D
They sub it on their own. They get the episodes straight from the distributors and as far as I can tell, sub it well before the episode airs, and are then allowed to put it up for streaming an hour after the episode airs in Japan.
see you later everyone
/me lives in a country where Japan is closeby
00,10only those he wants to see him can see him
Kyuubey manages to be cute and creepy at the same time.

00,10and that was ep 3
And now the girl is going to wish her back alive
Boooooo
That was sad
oh well
Not to sound like a jerk but that girl was kinda arrogant
She got cocky
She got beheaded.
...I missed it...
I just got back to the computer...
sonofa
00,10oh you missed it?
Yea, with the whole restraining the other magic girl she kind of had it coming
00,10well in that case
Yea. I got pulled away from the computer and missed about the 2nd half. I'll watch it later.
The last I saw, the black-haired girl was being tied up by the blonde
Slice
oh damn
Well...my prediction was half-right
How is that thing a him?
I expected it to be...what's her name...the blue-haired girl.
Sayaka?
Kanon is probably the first time anime made me emotional. :P
to
8]
But then at the same time, I kinda saw Mami not lasting long after learning her backstory earlier in the episode.
Okay...so why did people say this was messed up? It's only episode 3. The viewer really should have no connection to Mami.
:D
YES.
:D
This show was just pure win in it's day

Well it is, but it seems not many people are online on this map
dat surf map

They were in Denmark some years ago. It was cash.
'94? I was 5.

Random thought, Why did they make Hostel 3 if nopony liked Hostel 2?
in 1994 i was -4 years old
I was born in '94...
'91 here
Cool, thanks
/me 11,01shines

11,01*crazy laugh*
11,01Hell, I actually have a crazy laugh.
You totally do.
do*
wat
...Yeah.
that's how long my play sessions of amnesia are
11,01Amnesia is boring.
I like this very very slow psychadelic songs
I was at the live show in Denmark some years ago.
It was fun.
i think gilmour is still kicking
not in particular
wat
I'm getting sick of this buffering, and I know where it's coming from.
Dat Sax-Switch
Yeah, me too.
Gilmour's still alive, isn't he?
Yup.
this song, is how old?
very
it's from 1975
its like barren of psychedelic music
Is this the 1994 one?
than*
I use Pandora
pandoora? pffffffft

how old is he*.
oh, ok
>2012
People need to be thankful for roots, not todays crap
yeah, thinking that gay is an insult
i know most middle schooler does
Sticks and stones and everything.
11,01Kids are cruel.
All right, I need to take off folks. Hope to be back on sooner then later!
11,01BronyInstrumental: No.
11,01Lemme rephrase that.
11,01Some kids are cruel.
Silly fillies.
Middle schools, youll never find a larger hive of villany and evil
11,01PsychoticDoc: Agreed.
^
11,01Maximum bullying.
^
I was bullied during my middle school years and my high school years.
11,01Fun fact: I'm not a socially-confident person.
Neither am I.
hey
11,01My family hates the fact that I stay at home a lot.
11,01I'm just a Fluttershy.
I have no clue.
11,01Or a Twilight.
same here PsychoticDot
/me has got a hard infancy
then i wanna hug you nitt D:
hi
also re :)
11,01red_ony: I have no job.
I stay at home all the time, the only time I go out is to go to school
11,01I would have stayed in PA if I had money.
The rules said that there were supposed to be two teachers in the Special Ed room at all times. Oftentimes, there was only one. And other times, I'd be alone with those guys.
Hey guys, I'm back! :$
i feel kinda bad sometimes, cuz i wanna work and have tried to get a job in the past, but puffed up business managers wouldn't employ me for 'legal' reasons
11,01I'm glad there's a campaign against bullying nowadays.
strange thing is i'm anti social throughout high school, but suddenly because ponies i learn to talk to people about it until now
11,01When I was growing up, it was the victim's job to deal with it.
sorry :)
11,01Well, I see campaigns to stop bullying instead of telling victims how to deal with it.
Alright. Cool.
I like to think that idiots of my gen have made me even less social than i normally am
the only you can do sometimes is resist
11,01BronyInstrumental: Anti-bullying campaigns are worsening the problem?
because teachers don't care for u
ok
11,01BronyInstrumental: I guess punish the bullies?
11,01That was my solution.
^
Or at least put them in the bullied's shoes to make them desist
11,01Kammerjunk: No.
Oh.
11,01MadSurge: Not a bad idea.
i would make some ham sandwiches but this concert is cool
11,01Let them go through the pain of having zero friends and constant social rejection.
why are we even talking about this?
We just talk.
hug*
goddammit

Kittyfaec. :3

11,01killerpony7733: Same.
^True
wow. you guys had a lot of different ways to deal with the problems
11,01Where I hated everyone.
i dealt with it using music
11,01I'll stop.
00,10you dont have to stop nitt
i have an entire folder of songs i just sorta.....wrote as they came to me. maybe i'll release them one day, idfk
interesting discussion is good
yesh

and then an epileptic fit
It's clearly a sore spot with a lot of people around here.
I know, I know
11,01Sumica: I just don't want to depress others by complaining. I'll remind myself of my grandmother's friends that did nothing but complain and put me into depression.

"Alright! I got my beer and my chips, and I'm ready to spend a solid 4 hours (or however long) watching a Football game"!
11,01My grandmother has borderline personality disorder. Look it up.
11,01And be glad you're not living with someone with BPD.
I worked in a psychiatry instead of doing military duty...borderliners were the most annoying patiens I had...(no offence)
11,01Two people in my family have BPD.
I have aspurgurs
11,01It makes them self-centric brats.
11,01Worse off, they don't even know they have it.
Apparently it's unhealthy for teenagers to be spending hour upon hour of their free time grinding in an MMO, but it's totally healthy to sit around for hours and hours on end watching a bunch of people bounce a ball across a court or carry a handegg over a field of astroturf
^ seems legit
noo instead of military duty
05you guys enjoyign the show? :3
11,01Borderline Personality Disorder.
11,01Wrek: Yes.

Kinda
*of
11,01And it's not Pinkamena disorder.
sorry
11,01That's more bipolar.
ya you are right
you know, i may be have a bipolar syndrome
man, these ham sadwiches just made this conversation a lot less depressing
o/
farmville makes you a farmer!
11,01Even CoD works you out.
yes FPS does have benefits
of course, sitting still all day is unhealthy, but doing just about anything on a computer is far more mentally stimulating than watching tv
11,01You develop a skill from dealing with 12-year-olds.
11,01:p
11,01I kid.
11,01You do develop reflexes and whatnot.
11,01You die too fast in CoD to develop strategy when attacked.
i haven't watched TV in years
getting outsite and joing an engish course would probably have taught you faster :D
or BF3
but if you want teamplay go TF2
Tribes Ascend is hard, though.
11,01Valve games are good for teamplay.
you guys convinced me

I'm using a Wacom Tablet with the mouse accessory. It works just like a mouse, except the tablet decides what's up instead of the mouse.
