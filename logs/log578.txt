Being a Brony caused many of my friends to abandon me.

What is it with Harrison Ford and getting crushed by rooms?

that line always cracks me up
Yfw Luke Skywalker is Firelord Ozai.
Dat jedi stealth
CriticKitten: it was good.
how is it no one noticed him
Just open all the pressure hatches.
how do ppl not notice a old man walking around with a robe O_O
The Dark Knight Rises was without a doubt THE BEST MOVIE EVER

hah I did not realize that Mark Hamill did Fire Lord Ozai XD
poor chewie :'(
Pudge: ok
He also does the absolute best of all the Joker impressions.
Chewie is best tank
/me 11,01dusts GarrettBrony
His voice is just fantastic.
This one night, I was about to bone my girlfriend.. and then there was this drill..
He was the best Joker, period.
Mark Hamill is The Joker AND Fire Lord Ozai...
MURDER THEM
GET DARK SIDE POINTS
CriticKitten agreed.
eh, I was pretty underwhelmed by the dark knight...I think I'll pass on the newest one
And Skips from Regular show.
Arcshod the only other person I would argue was the best joker is Keath Ledger
Wait...best charge scene...best charge...BESSSSSTTTT CHAAARRRGGGEEE!
Leeeeeeeeeroy...
AAAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
wtf...?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Hey, Han Shot First... again

And then more
that knockback
why did they run away?
FUCK YOU
I'll wait til it's on video. Until a few seconds ago I thought I was the only person who didn't care for the Dark Knight.
shit they just remembered they outnumber me
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Don't get me wrong, I love the Ledger Joker, but Hamill's Joker voice is CLASSIC. And it really makes the Arkham Asylum/City games even better having his crazy voice behind it.
look Luke is Skipping like an ape
AARRRRGGGGGAAAAAHHH!!! :O
CriticKitten: its sad that Hamill isnt doing more joker work
Seriously how did they not hit him?
What kind of stupid hallway is that? I thought he came out to a hangar?! :{
EPIC MOMENT COMING :D

Darth
00,10we meet again for the first time for the last time
Nittany_Discord: it is an epic fight man
But this one is definitely a classic.
Nittany_Discord: yeah the only thing that the prequels did right were the lightsaber duels
It's got the remastered saber effects.
Think of Wonder Woman... think of Wonder Woman....
the dumbass that got knocked into the lava. Some master.....
otakon: right? those battles were terrible
otakon: Eh. Yes and no.
Kids like lasers. Kids like swordfighting. You know what would be awesome, laser swordfights
00,10it's a wub battle
Arcshod what if the next time they rerelease Star Wars they digitally Insert Ponies
"I See Your Schwartz Is as Big as Mine"
If you strike me down I shall become more powerfull than you can imagine
oh... found out my supervisor at work is a bit of a derp. she thought it was lightsaver, not saber
No, you'll just be dead
DAT QUOTE
11,01Did you hear David Prouse do these lines?
Bronysith: huh? how were the lightsaber battles horrible in Episode 1?
otakon: the battles in the prequels were horrible. just over choreographed bullshit
otakon: thiose werent duels. THEY WERE DANCING
Obi Wan is second best martyr.
brb
Bronysith: it was still more interesting than this
Didn't Obi wan actually win this fight?
the prequel's light saber fight slacked any emotional impact..
otakon: NOPE it is just dancing
Bronysith, really no one cares
Goddamn it's like watching Rockem Sockem robots
Bronysith: these are horribly coreographed duels. its two sides of the coin
otakon: that isnot how a duel would happen in real life
Vordox yes... when you call that winning
I love the fact that THIS fight is way more intense than the one by the same characters in episode 3.
otakon: The old fights weren't as well choreographed but usually had some good emotion behind it. The prequel battles are choreographed to DEATH. They're flashy but there's no emotion, it's just Hollywood flair.
and hope they didn't disable the engines, the weapons, the navigation, the life support, etc etc etc
Ben...? :O :O
portal cubes!
XylemTube: are you kidding me? he was entirely pointless
CriticKitten: yeah but that is what I'm saying they are more impressive looking even if they aren't as "deep"
I prefered the superimposed hundreds of Stoms at the chase scene.
SLICE
NOOOOOO!!!! :'(
NOOOO OBI WAN! :'(
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Kandarihu the best martyr is torgo
And yet again somehow, they don't hit him.
:'(
00,10you forgot the couch
*cue sad music*
Poor eels :'(
HHH-AA!
Suddenly music and weird wtfness when he just turns into Midichlorians
Now Luke has a reason
Except he wasnt killed :P
Run, Luke, Run!
hmm somehow they turned the couch Invisible
Run Luke run!
RUN, LUKE. RUN!
AVENGE ME LUKE FACE VADER NOW!!!
Actually I think that sword fight with Darth Maul was the best if not the only really good scene in ep1.
INBOUND BEST SCENE OF THE MOVIE!!!!
Vordox: You mean when he becomes one with the force. Midichlorians do not exist.
Run, Forrest, Run! Wait, wrong movie...
otakon: I agree, they LOOK better. But I don't like them as much because they just don't have the same feeling to them. It feels like you're watching a staged match, it doesn't feel as alive.
See Luke. See Luke Run. Run, Luke, run!
SirGanjalf|SetToStun: the battle is just dancing, no real emotional conflict
Shame he died:|
hen3ry: no they exist.
And I prefer the faster duels, honestly. It's better for music videos, and it made me love Star Wars more.
CriticKitten: yeah I can see that
11,01Run, For... dammit Lunchbox!
Not one of them could hit him from 50ft away with rifles. Damn the future can suck
Vordox: No, see, you've bought into the rumor that there were "prequels"
CriticKitten: I feel ya. The battle here isn't too good, but the battle between Luke and Vader is one of the best sword fights ever.
otakon: ill just get mass effect 3 next month
CriticKitten: still like Yoda's fight though.
back :P
Bronysith: sounds good
SirGanjalf|SetToStun: Oh come on..Wshat about those awesome podraces? :O (jk)
I don't know why he's so upset
Why do they call them TIE Fighters?
Lightsabers should be made of Nokia 3310's.
As a kid, I loved the space battles and the saber duels. That hasn't stopped. XD
Mares and GentleStallions: John Williams at his best!
He knew Obi Wan for like 4 hours
ponibas: Twin Ion Engine
otakon: cause then it isnot MY money that is supporting EA, nyuck nyuck nyuck
SuperSanjitenks1989 and Nintendium
>.<
00,10it's ok luke, the prequal trilogy would have killed him any ways
the best peice of music right here
These ones aren't as flashy, but there's LIFE to them. It's like watching an actual sword fight. Too much concern for looking pretty in most of the prequel duels.
Well even though we won't look at the prequels can we look at Star Tours after the movies are over?
Sumica: lol
red_ony: meh, there were ok when i was a kid
hen3ry: You sure? It's not cause it looks like a Tie?
DUN! Dun, Dun, Dunna!
Stop hatin on the prequels they arent as bad as people say
i fucking loves this scene
Vordox: a bit of that too.
Thai Fighters
THE MUSIC IS EPIC

Calcos: Inorite? Return of the Jedi's fight sequence is one of the most memorable bits of the series.
SirGanjalf|SetToStun: Well I was just kidding after all...
Why is the audio so tinny?
Sumica: adrenaline is pumping for me right now

This Episode IV?

unspoiled Episode IV
YOU HEAR SOUNDS
Pudge: For some reason, it sounds like it's coming froma cell phone
11,01I killed someone!
3Thai tie tying TI fighters
Why do laser cannons have recoil?
Bronysith: he's mine bitch!
Don't get penisy.
Calcos323: this movie isnt exactly new you know
guess those laggs mean I can go get a drink now
SlurryMoon: ...What
/me Ties otakon to a chair "Hush you. Now I'm gonna leave you tied to this chair until you calm down"
/me fangirl slaps PaladinDrakkenwolf
Vordox: Because Star Wars is well known for its realism. :P
BOOM!
Star Tours, yesss...ah likes that. Also, why so few fighters? I remember more...and yes, the ROTJ fight is one of the best. Then Palpitine had to be a Marty Stu. :D
Reactor cause the energy discharge
CriticKitten: Clearly!
Pudge: It doesn't sound like that when I watch it on my VHS, though
Reactor, maybe it's a pulse lazer?
Meow
Reactor: because that are most probably actually blasters
/me starts a slap fight with Bronysith
Reactor ikr ... Light has no Mass , and recoil only happens when mass gets accelerated
In space everybody can hear you Howie scream
/me Pokes messanger below me
xD Threepio :P
"Thats how we do it in my neighborhood!"
00,10aretwo mocks your pain
Calcos323: sounds exactly the same as I remember :S
/me Tackles PaladinDrakkenwolf and Bronysith down to the floor
"I am melting!"
/me gives Sumica a mark hamil
Hard to believe this movie was made in '77. Feels like it was made in the mid 80s
So let's review: to recapture a priority Rebellion prisoner, you send exactly three TIE fighters after them.
/me 11,01plays in the Reactor and gets radiated
Pudge: Must be a problem on my end, then
If they were PLASMA cannons, recoil would make sense.
/me gives Nittany_Discord a rainbow dash
11,01Thank Bronysith.
magmablock: Go watch a space odeysee
/me is played in by Nittany_Discord
In Star Wars, the woman is alright useful!

Ohohoho... I've picked a bad movie this week!
CriticKitten: not to mention the weaponry of the space station
/me closes the reactor down. and remembers Nittany_Discord's part cat... So he's Schroedinger's Nitts's cat.

this movie has about 20min left
We're tracking them. We'll just make sure to follow far enough behind that we're sure to give them time to plan an attack on us.
/me makes a trollface
gibe money please
Randomnerd: "|
Who shot JR?
Randomnerd: :|
"No"
Randomnerd: You shall...be poked by Gummy for that! :[
luke be jealous
The horror! The horror!
otakon: ddo you have mass effect 3 for pc? if so i would love to play multiplayer
Han Solo is the biggest pimp
Randomnerd: Why ? This movie was just too bad? :(
Fou_Lou: I'm amazed that it ONLY occurs to the princess that this thing is being tracked, given that they were MAJOR targets. No way you send not even a full squadron of fighters after them.
Bronysith do I taste like raisans?
I noticed something odd in the newsletter. It says you'll be streaming the star wars prequels, but thats impossible considering no such prequels exist
speeding they be
pew pew .. gotcha
11,01Tides must be horrible on that moon.
pewepew
Bronysith: enope, PC can't run it plus started my journey on the 360 WHERE IT FIRST BEGAN.
red_ony: because I'm EVIL.
otakon: yea i did play mass effect 1 and 2 on 360
CriticKitten: yep
How did they hear about Alderaan?
>galaxy-wide Rebellion
otakon: everyone remembers there mass effect journies
Those graphics
PinkiePieYoshi64: GNN.
xD
Blow up death star... DONT WORRY WELL JUST BULD ANOTHER 1
IshBestPony we're showing originals only
>their fleet contains roughly 20 single-pilot fighters
look at those next gen graphics
Welp they ded
that was a nice 3D Dot Demo from a 64 XD
11,01Oh look, it's right there!
C64*
nub nub
It occured to me that this film has silly scene transitions.
Because R2 is their only hope! Akso, the Death Star has...2 other versions? One official, one EU?
otakon: mass effect 1 was hilariously buggy on pc
fucking LAG
otakon: like when i got on that snow planet with the rachnis everyone turned to black blobs for a while
Death Star gives them time... to plan an attack, launch an attack, and still have the Death Star just out of range of its target.
hay guys
hey Bronysith http://www.geeksofdoom.com/GoD/img/2011/05/2011-05-31-who_droids-533x503.jpg
Bronysith: yh but they did improve the inventory and control scheme
Excuse me? Pricess Leea?
"This trech"
those old school 3D rendering
SuperSanjitenks1989: same here man
dem futuristic graphics
"They are lines"
"Use your imagionation"
"ok"
Why trench?
inb4 one-up
looks like pong graphics
otakon: do they have health packs in me3? i dont like the regenerating health
the shaft
Uh, why do you have to go down the trench? Can't you just dive towards the hole and drop it down the hole?
thats a really bad weakness. somebody need to fire the morons who designed the deathstar.
00,10TOLD
zomg sagas it is a pong graphics
rats bigger than 2 meters
That is a pretty big weakoness
may the force be with you
CriticKitten, details
He keeps saying shaft
And also with you
Tbh if you can't hit a target that's two metres across you shouldn't be holding a gun.
May the Dash be with you... :D
sagas kinda like vectrex
Haos
I say we're in range now. Fire.
Halos*
11,01Otakon: Aren't there microtransactions in the MP?
sagas,, i've seen them rats.. they're big
hell, you have Death Star that Kills Planets.
He should see the HISHE of this after the movie
Lil_B: To think we once though that as futuristic
*We
Commander's just like, "Yeah, whatever, weirdo."
Nittany_Discord whats MP?
Destroy Gas Giant, then destroy Rebel Moon. Two shots, five minutes.
11,01ME3.
GarrettBrony: multiplayer
>small moon is protected by gas planet
>doesn't try to fire laser through the gas planet
Gosh... I seriously feel like paying Star Wars:Rouge Squadron, idk why!
DURR HURR
Well..or you could just explode the planet blocking your fireing lane then the one with the rebel base on it...-.-
red_ony: HISHE
sagas yeah, its raser humorus that we see inferiour Technology in a Futuristic Setting :)
Live Long and Prosper
not sure if trolling
Eulshy: Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
SHAFT
Use mirrors to deflect the death star beam
red_ony: I think there's a cooldown on the laser
problem solved
And then he got out of there to go buy a high-end apartment.
I enjoyed the prequals, YEAH, FUCK ME RIGHT?
The HISHE is funny, though nonsensical. Yavin is a gas planet. There's really no reason they shouldn't try to fire the laser THROUGH Yavin at the moon.
I <3 appartments
hen3ry, but can the Death Star's planet buster fire twice in quick succession?
Arcshod He one Bad Mother Fu.....
Kandarihu: Let's Find Out!
they need rainbow dash she is good with the force\
Shut yo mouth!
GabeMoist: I've always thought if a laswer would be affected by a mirror lol
Arcshod: Can ya dig it?
Damn.... so tired..... but I have to watch the whole thing....
.
wait
Arcshod MAN i was only talking about Shaft
and my chat derped ...again,...:/(
when did he suddenly start speaking droid
Kandarihu: The one in Return of the Jedi can, by reducing the power of its shots to nail star cruisers instead. :p
GarrettBrony We can dig it!
Laser + mirror, if sufficiently powerful, equals melted glass and melted sheet of reflective metal.
Arcshod I can dig it
i'm back with snacks
00,10why do they have turbines?
Where's Fox?
Because star fighters
Sumica: cause you clop at night
:D
CriticKitten, I see. But then again, it can't destroy planets like that.
Pudge did you bring me anything
Sumica: Good question, there's no air in space...
00,10I do not, I clop in the morning
Sumica, for cool sound effects oyu shouldn't be able to hear in space anyway
Because atmosphere. Can't you hear everything in space?
those are the APUs?
11,01Same reason the missiles in Wargames had turbines?
Fuck it, I'm sleeping.
Kandarihu: No, but they could slag the entire Rebel Base with that level of fire power.
/me hands GarrettBrony a bag of cheetos
Sumica: O_O
thanks Pudge
CriticKitten, true.
Dat small fleet!
It's not like the entire moon is a base, just the small portion.
At least give me some weed.
11,01You'd think they would go around the other way.
00,10here we go
I've always claimed that R2-D2 is the most foul-mouthed character in movie history. The only way they were able to get it past the censors was to make him speak a digital language.

Y-Wings are awesoem O:<
Y wings are bombers. X wings are fighters.
Hey it's the space Red Tails
why don't those x wings fire at the guns?
I just thought of something. Yavin is a gas giant. If the Death Star were to fire at it, the beam might not have anything solid to hit.
*smokes the weed*..... i'm hungry
mmmm cooked Luke
Red Dead Redemption standing by
05kidna makes me miss when i used to play xwign vs tie fighter as a kid
11,01Y wings are strong. It's just that the empire use 1-hit kills.

that warning sound is so iconic

PORKINS!! :D
NOOOOOOO

Maybe a proper HISHE would be just the Death Star firing THROUGH Yavin and blowing up the moon from the other side.
PULL UP!

NOOOO

Fried Pork
-lol.....porkins
PULL OUT

of course kill the fat guy

DO A BARREL ROLL!
11,01And fat.
I can't let you do that Starfox
Kandarihu: If the planet is sufficiently sized, the pressure near the core would be enough to turn the gases into solid
Red Delicious and Gold Delicious are best pilots
I CAN HOLD IT
Porkins! Nuuu!
USE THE SCHWARTZ LUKE
i always wondered why they called him porkins
CriticKitten even in Rouge Squadron? (I mean there are some missions where you have to use it and the bombs)
NO PORKINNNNSS
RIP Porkins
Can't let you do That, Porkins!
I HAVE THE GOD DAMNED MUNCHIES GIVE ME FOOD
this reminds me of the AWESOME acrade game
today will be forever known as St Porkins Day Kandarihu
Tiny gray fighters. Switch to visual scanning
JackofApples: I played 'em in the original Rogue Squadron game on the N64, they're SOOOOO bad.
vrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeee
I wish the actual death star levels in games let you hit all of the surface in games.
rip
There's no tails on these planes
fat high speed action
JackofApples: They take a little more abuse than most ships, but not enough.
Dem Tai Fighters
I could quote so many Star Fox lines right now.
*dat
CriticKitten and to think that they were maid by Factor 5 :(
otakon: next you are going to say that the stupid naboo space fighter scene was better than this
dat explosion
i got a lock... FOX 3
i'll save you Biggs!
DO A BARREL ROLL
just had to do that
Bronysith: oh hell no not a chance
magmablock, true. But where the Death Star is, at the time of before the rebels started trenchrunning, they could fire and only graze the outer reaches of the planet.
why dont these fighters have missles?
Ah! I'm hit!
okay... bye
CriticKitten: Y-Wings were bad*** on Rogue: Squadron, they especially hleped a lot on Assult on Kyle II
Can't let you do that Red Fox.
otakon: okay good.... *puts away lightsaber*
CriticKitten: I've played 'em in all the games, and I don't fly directly into fights...I do the bombing run, and pull out. :3
Bronysith: the lightsaber duels were more fun is all I was saying.
Everyone should have used Naboo starfighters instead.
Bronysith does it bug you that in the original Rouge Squadron game the Naboo Fighter was better than the X-Wing?
They needed cheap disposable fighters for cheap, disposable pilots.
They were way better.
/me sticks CriticKitten s head on a stake
Or better, Jedi Starfighters! Seismic Charges FTW!
Holy God, I forgot how epic this is
JESmith71: what? the only star wars games are KoToR
Jedi Starfighters ARE sweet.

hen3ry so what your saying is that in universe TIE Fighters were made of Balsa Wood and Craft Glue?
Nopony mess with the ARC-170s and Sentinal-Class shuttles, they're MINE!!!! :O
That Naboo Starfighter. It was crazy how they tried to keep that thing a secret until Episode 1 came out, but someone found it early anyway.
00,10why is he talking like shatner?
oh look an atari game
GarrettBrony: And Duct Tape
I'm a fan of the B-wing
Y-Wings are just too slow for my tastes.

But actually, I was pretty damn hot stuff in a Z-95 headhunter if I do say so myself.
Luke, use the Barrel Roll.

Woulda fired the Torps mahself! Come on! That would be awesome!
Luke Press z or r twice!

GarrettBrony, I missed that
If they could talk...
you did
Luke are you sure we can make it? - It's just like Everfree Forest back at home :D
Does no one think to try to COVER each other in the trench? They coulda killed Vader and his supports in seconds if they tried! :[

There's a difference between a non-brony and an anti-brony.
mishia: No regret
frying pan is my hero :P
3SB wanted to take over, so I guess he can go now
Kandarihu: non-brony si someone who doesn't like the show but at the same time doesn't hate it.
SlurryMoon, you ever think about changing from something that won't get accidently typed as SluttyMoon?
mishia You didn't watch Robot Chicken? Give it a chance, bro!.......who was the anti-brony visit?
SlurryMoon: thaks man

inb4 sleeping pill
Don't worry, the links are SFW
Reactor: :D
Dark92Enigma, my take on it is that a non-brony doesn't really care one way or another. A non-brony views FiM with about as much respect as most bronies views... well, that news channel we were talking about earlier.
Eddmario: I love those drawings
Eddmario: XD
So, who's played Gears of Halo Theft Auto 6?
/me what do?
Ironically, both FiM and Faux are equally accurate in reporting current news. And at nearly the same age level.
Suddenly Rainbow Dash is next to you WHAT DO?
Does anypony play league of legends?
hec-3rm Sometimes I uninstall TF2 and install Lol
RainBowJack: Brohoof her
/me hug dashie, that's what do
Make cupcakes
Kandarihu: well, you can be an anti-brony and like MLP FIM. one of my friends loves the show but hates bronies, because hes always been around the creepy fapping bronies. :( so it kinda ruined his take on bronies, so he will be nice to bronies as long as they dont refrance fan materials.
So superBrony64! Someone made a playable of the pony version of Faithful Farmer. Not as easy as you and the youtube videos make it out to be, but I am a quick learner, so I'm kinda getting the hang of it.
mishia, good point.
Note: youre most likely a non brony when watching the first pony video for the first time
brb
boop
mishia: Well that's dumb. He likes ponies but hates bronies
mishia: You and your friend DO know some cloppers do have standards, right?
your a quick learner and im a quick thinker :) my god do i love my name
is the show over now?
XylemTube: looks like it
Ponies47: he was around cloppers and the creepy ones. and he was only shown REALLY BAD fan material. Eddmario: i know cloppers have standards. Dint make it any less bad for him though. he got some of the worst, ok?
/me wake up and see fluttershy flank. what do?
well the shows not done yet some one will stream eventually either that or they are having problems
its not somones fault to like a show but dislike the fanbase
mishia: Ah the cloppers. Cloppers don't bug me.
me nethier
Quick_Thinker: i wish i was you, im a brain dead thinker
its there prefrance, why bother. he just really dint liek it .-.
the numbers, mason.
SuperBrony64: How long til next stream?
uh suppertroworld no you do wish you were me my motto is this IM A QUICK THINKER NOT X THINKER
so who was phone?!?
hec-rm: Like this
hey guys
wait a sec, i wanna change my name
Hi, xisbestchemical
which my motto can apply to many things
mishia: Then type /nick and follow it up with the new name
Ok

You can do /nick NameGoesHere to change your nick, Dj-pwn-3
I prefer loging in and out.... i dint know we had a nick command .-.
ugh movie is taking forever for me
also if i recall im the only one in the entire chat with a Q in thier name
xisbestchemical: There is no stream right now
o nvm i new here
.... thats gonna change in a few secongd isnt it
Quick_Thinker: maybe only q as a frist letter?
Eddmario Thanks :D
I used to be an adventurer like you, but then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
ok, who wants free hugs?
I DO
nope im the only one with a Q in thier name
xisbestchemical: welcome to the herd /)

im sure somepony would say i try to steal Twi but then again she is a unicorn who can shot lazors soo im not gonna try that
My brother's a Hello Kirrarian, so he'd probably join and bash us all if he was here
XAX|Zombies: So fun
Eddmario, read that second username carefully.

Sorry, it's hot as hell here right nw

the buck?
An anti-brony walks by you on the sidewalk raging about MLP. What do you do?
how did you gain + 4 trust TAHT MAKES NO SENSE
xisbestchemical, mind my own business and move on
xisbestchemical: Ask them if they've seen the show
educate the non brony hater on MLP and bring up the shows music and fanbase
why would I even care for him?
Try a option that wont piss him off
xisbestchemical : love and tolarate the S*yay* out of him
lol
I'm with CrimsonPhoenix on that one
/me xisbestchemical leave him to his rages, since its his oppionon, and i have no right to get angry at him
You guys seriously
My dog is mad :P
we ain't no jehova witness

Eddmario: You pinged me?
0,14later RainBowJack
Bye
crimsonpheonix i see ur point, if he is an anti-bony he might not have seen the show, so why waste time on it
God.. some people are stupid in my Wow realm's trade chat
xisbestchemical, also it's opinions
Ok I was PMing with somepony. What are we talking about right now? 6_9
Loving MLP isn't obligatory
Ponies47: Ponies
xisbestchemical: if he has seen the show, seriously leave him alone. its his right to hate it, and unless hes being rude to you our insulting you/bronies, leave him be
yet you guys make it seems so
well some eductation of the show couldnt hurt all that much it might even change his mood
Ponies? Did you say ponies?
CrimsonPhoenix: I dislike the fans who are either like it or die
I did
Make us look like a fucking cult
NEVER EVER ASK FOR POINES OH GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONEEEEEEE
Note: insulting bronies means callign them all somthing rude. saying they may like internet more, like ponies, or are old isnt a insult
SpadeMagnes[R], I share the same opinion
SpadeMagnes[R]: *nod*
Quick_Thinker: But Sea Ponies are awesome! :D
SpadeMagnes[R]: why cant we just leave them alone if they arent being rude to us??
Some people take jabs at us too seriously

Wow, that was weird...

now something rude will always be said in this world with rap and mosstly teens that curse like sailers

Crap, can someone kick Eddmario and CrimsonThinker?
For example, Total Biscuit says ONE thing about my little pony and people flip their shit
GAH

So how about dead island music to G3.5 Scootaloo? :3

/me molests Vordox in the ass for even suggesting that
0,14Sumica whyyyyyyyyy
/me eats muffin and that's all there is to it :3
Guile Theme or Luna's Dutch My Little Pony song? :D
Quick_Thinker: ... or it's EXACTLY why we ask for ponies
This music is so appropriate for killing undead nazis.
BASTARD SUMICA YOU WILL PAY

Quick_Thinker: Ponies are special, the good kind of ponies, which you only get on movie night
Ah are you ever gonna run out of muffins?

I have my chat client set up so that whenever anyone gets kicked or banned it plays a clip of JC Denton saying "What a shame."
If this is oing to happen. I'm gonn a play black ops zombies on ipad

Guile theme with this video? Oh geeze, I dunno about that :S

Handd drawn animations... I love you <3
I used to like a girl name nadia...
Vordox: agreed
Seriously that reminds me of the Egg Carrier
SpadeMagnes[R]: How?
How fast is a Knot anyway?
I used to like a girl named Nadia too. But then I grew out of being obsessed with anime :3
Dj-pwn-3: its shape
SpadeMagnes[R]: aaah
OWCH.
My connection is crapping out on me...
"Even when I was a child I would hit myself for being a child!"
SpadeMagnes[R]: Isn't 1 knot like...30 meters?
so...fast?
Or was it 30 meter per minute
Hulllaaa

Also, Captain Nemo is voiced by Akio Ohtsuka who voiced Solid Snake.

Blue water is an amulet.

Onigiri? You mean those triangular rice balls?
Yea
It bugged me the pokemon dub called them jelly donuts...
Yeah, I was about to say that xD
SHOCKERS
moron
SpadeMagnes[R]: Really? Jelly doughnuts?
They called soup "hamburgers" at one point, IIRC
Reactor: Yea they called them jelly donuts
Which makes no sense
Shatterings torpedos O.o
REUSED CLIPS
You talking about Pokemon dub?
EMPS!
Reactor: It makes me think they think kids are stupid
Try educating them what onigiri are...
Did they use this clip before?
Cant be that hard to say they're balls of rice
SpadeMagnes[R]: It's because of such shows some kids ARE stupid.
SpadeMagnes[R]: They definitely think kids are stupid
http://fav.me/d5896mn Where's your god now?
And If you tell anyone I will come to your house and I will cut you
You know still being a Princess when no one outranks you makes no sense
Reactor: yep. they really do.
CrimsonPheonix: My interest is peaked!
Fooooreshaaadoooowiiiiing!
Heck, I WAS a stupid kid.
Then I moved to Australia
lightning keeps flashing out of my window but i cant hear it through my headset ... anyway , what is this?
And I was forced to become internationalised
This one line in the article bothers me
well think of it this way at least they didnt try to song the theme in enlgish they were nice enough to not do that
0,14well, I'm off to bed
Make the show as envelope-pushing as you like… but when it comes to knowing what the girls in the audience want, we’re following Disney’s lead.

God I hate stereotypes
SuperBrony64, how many discs is the entire show on?
SpadeMagnes[R]: unless you do somthing good with them or make them less obvious: the main 6
Also, dat Twilight Saga :|
SpadeMagnes[R]: Stereotypes make me rage
Why isn't the stream loading for me?
Reactor: unless
DUHHHHHHHH LETS WATCH THE TWILIGHT MOVIES
they are sooooooo goooodd
Realisticly Celestia should be a Queen because no one outranks her
same here stereotypes suck
Quick_Thinker: DONT LOOK AT IT, IT WILL MAKE YOU BRAIN COME OUT YOUR EYES
11,02This Collection 1 has 20 episodes.
There is a very prevalent attitude towards the makers of childrens animation that young children aren't intelligent, so everything has to be dumbed down. It's pretty much the mentality that G3.5 and G3.6 was developed around.
/me kills the imposter and burns his body
GabeMoist: Try and Re-try again
seriously people
Oh dear, that's maybe the first half of the show.
I was pretty smart as a kid
Been trying for 20 minutes
okay what did i type a few seconds ago while i went and got something to drink
Kandarihu: also dumbed down work is a lot easier to make so often times people opt to use that
Otherwise known as "The Better Half".
aren't even rembering that the main 6 are basicly sterotypes mangaed into intresting charters???
SuperBrony64: And storywise created by Miyasaki
GAbeMoist: TRY HARDER
;)
The way they dumb down stuff makes it look like we're retarded
Hmm?
Not much else I can do
i found you
SpadeMagnes[R]: reason why i whatch older shows from at least before the 2007's
8,6sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
Mishia: theyre not just stereotypes. they have well developed characters. yes, each one of them embodies a few stereotypical traits, but they are not limited by those traits
G'night Kirz

11,02O.O
Jean is trying TOO hard for a Accent if you ask me.
Also, dead people.
nite AttackAndalite|Zzz love you :)
NOT THE DOGGGGGGGGGGG
FOR KIIIIDZ
11,02The dog died ;A;
Was gold and silver even out at the time in japan when the first season of pokemon came out?
purple blood?
There was a kid there.
SpadeMagnes[R], nope
Oh no, the kid...
11,02Who cares about the people!? THE DOG DIED ;A;
seriously that blood looks purple
Kandarihu: Then why did they put Ho-oh in the first episode?
The Girl is fine. She was in the Title Sequence.
SuperBrony64: Ikr :(
You know what is annoying about the pokemon dub?
WHAT IS THIS?!
There was a banned safari episode
oh the safaria episode
11,02Capfluttershy: Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water
SpadeMagnes[R]: SpadeMagnes[R] the one with james in a swimsuit?
Oh hey, the kid is fine! She's just sleeping in the arms of HER DEAD MOTHER. Isn't that just dandy? :|
oh
SpadeMagnes[R]: That was because the Park keeper pulled a Revolver on Ash.
KITTY!!
cant keep quite
i think..
Yea but he gets 30 tauros out of nowhere
SpadeMagnes[R]: team rocket uses guns alot....in the japnese verison. and there boss loves his cigrattes. Jessus, they think kids cant handle dis shit?
11,02MARIE :D
YO MOM IS DEAD
a lion?
ded
i thouht he was a dog
cwueeeee!
oh well
that makes me a idot
You know because of that one episode Porygon and its evos have never been in the show
O__________________________________________________O
BUT I WANT IT NAO
11,02;A;
"Soon you will" THEY GONNA KILL THE KID!!
Okay, I'm back
It wasnt even Porygon who caused it
uhhhhhhhh THEY ARE HIDING VERY VERY WELL KIDDO
*sniff*
well i'm off to bed, nite guys
Marie is so cute <3
11,02Night HatchetRyda :)
SpadeMagnes[R], a sign depicting Porygon2 was seen in one episode. But besides that, you're right.
"okay.?"
dat title screen ruins the mood
/me hugs SuperBrony64
Pikachu actualy caused the seizure
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH
SAY WHAT AGAIN!
the mask are killing me XD
These guys are pretty much the main villains.
PING
and why do they not think the team rocket villians arent the surviors
SpadeMagnes[R]: oh the sezuire deal? the show flashes all the time. It causes tons of seziures on its own. besdies, what happened to putting that "sezuire warning" anyway?
seriously....
they were near the crash
I hope he doesnt run into Zapdos
*_*
SpadeMagnes[R], Pikachu is the mascot and therefore above reproach. And Porygon is made of code, and is technically not alive and therefore completely expendable.
Oh wait wrong universe
In Pokemon best wishes, they mention Ash's age too. 10!!! He NEVER AGED A DAY!!!
oh no.
oh no
0,5Night
NOOOOOO
Goodnight BaconMane!
You know whats the most bullshit thing?
Flashback
night BM
night Bacon.
soorrry. BaconMane
Pikachu lost to a snivy that never battled
people weeping
OMG NOOOOOOOOOO
11,02Oh god ;A;
:(
It was total bullshit
/me hugs SuperBrony64
You know, calling these guys KKK isn't that far off, now that I think about it.
/me hugs Vordox back ;A;
this is more sad because shes telling a little kid's verison of death
uhhhhhhh damn this show takes death quite serious
SpadeMagnes[R]: That was because of Plot. He got hit by Uber Lightning before that.
Holy shit old anime
So I can forgive THAT.
who is streaming?
So there is no excuse
mortor fire and shoot outs
Just so you know, SuperBrony64. We all have genuine unknowingly got into this and most of us have NEVER seen this. :P
So this is all pure "First seen"
dont cry little kid *pets*
Kandarihu: But in one episode they celebrate him and pikachu being together for a year
I've seen this in old anime catalogs
5!
These guys are pretty much the Nazis of the show.
So thats bullshit
11,02This is the first time I'm seeing this either :3
1 2 5
And that's all I have to say on it.
SuperBrony64: I hear it's a classic series
Jean is Badass...European?
too bad he doen't know how to count past 4
XD
SpadeMagnes[R], then it's officially a plothole.
11,02otakon: I figured O.O
shoot them as soon as they come out O_O
whhhhhhat
RUN DAMMIT!
I mean Pikachu should not have lost to that snivy
damn this anime or show or whatever you want to call it rocks
The KKK-guy is at least Genre Savvy.
You know, I've watched the entire show at one point.
the other villians were causal people with calss. these people- OH GOD
He has non electrical moves to use
GENIUS
Quick_Thinker: it's a older one thats for sure
http://www.funnyjunk.com/channel/ponytime/Where+Little+Ponies+come+from/vpecGic/ XD
UNDERSTOOD
There is no fucking excuse for pikachu losing
SpadeMagnes[R]: Ash was an Idiot. Because of Idiot Ball.
http://www.dorkly.com/comic/30748/skyrim-hoarders
I just got done playing some SPAZ
it's pretty good
And you know what sucks?
All of this happening in less than one year certainly explains why he hasn't become more experienced, except for the fact that he's a young child and therefore capable of improving himself much better than an adult could.
Ash is never going to become a champion because of new games
Bronysith: And this is related how?
SpadeMagnes[R]: That is the saddest part. He is forever trapped in Time and Fate of Losing.
Jean is serious :O
Vordox: cause lootsack of crushing
..
i like how they are dealing with death its how most kids would try to handle it with other kids
I mean he could have been a Frontier brain.. AND HE TURNED IT DOWN
http://catmacros.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/cat-halp-1-1.jpg?w=720
What is related to either the anime,or pony?
Polydunami: Of course. He is a European Badass!! I think.
Oh look
wait. isnt this anime have something to do with tentacle rape?
Umm, no?
Also remind me of that one chick from Tonoko
But indeed. He's been de-aged to 10 as of Best Wishes.
Bronysith: dear God no
why is it alaways that some how anime is lead to tentacle rape?
Quick_Thinker: the thing is it doesn't
or hentia
No, I watched the show and I remember nothing about tentacle rape.
Ash is still incompetent
Quick_Thinker, it's a cliche of hentai, or so I hear from everybody.
SpadeMagnes[R]: In Diamond and Pearl he was competent. Somewhat.
Damn....
Also may I ask how dipping a Magmar in lava beats it?
I just pierced my finger with my beard
._.
Kandarihu: it's a hentai cliche, originally meant to be scary but then they found out some liked the idea.... yikes.
Vordox: ouch I've done that before
He had a hardcore rival in Diamand and Pearl.
Vordox: You got a Stekk Beard!
*Steel
Vordox: eyebrow hair
The rival in Diamond and Pearl was a douche
Yeah but did your pierce the WHOLE finger?
:D
And isnt Gary the same age as Ash?
burying the bodies?
00,10sounds like a pogostick
I liked Gary best, as Rival. And Ash's victory against him was satisfactory.
SpadeMagnes[R], perhaps. But Shinji's technique was more effective.
So how the hell is Gary able to drive a car?
00,10he has swag
Vordox: no, but I did have my eyebrow hair sticking quite a bit in my finger.
otakon: Always fun when it happens
I GOT HAIR OF STEEL
He shouldent be allowed to drive
SpadeMagnes[R]: Because he is Gary Mother****** Oak. And don't you forget about it.
when does Gary drive a car?
Quick_Thinker: several times
AFK
well simple
You wanna go
Ok
BANG
let her jump off the cliff
Jean's....Family?
dat sad accent.
Vordox: no I don't think so.
very nice fandub
feels
You know...
Quick_Thinker: fandub?
You remember your first time encountering death of a family or friend?
someone said it was a fandub
Quick_Thinker: pretty sure this is the official dub.
Your very first time when you knew what it meant?
Just one question. Will this end like most other Gainax Series?
Or learnt to understand it
otakon: it is
I wonder what Project A-Ko would be under movie wise.....
I'm back. What did I miss? :3
my first encounter with death was my pet bunny getting his foot stuck in a cage and starving whille we went on vaction
Polydunami: they buried the little girls parents
Yeah, I remember that.
This is Gainax, but it's Gainax the way they were before they were driven to hire on Hideaki Anno to do... whatever he wanted to do.
GNIGHT everypony, may the force be with you all and may you pierce the heavens with your drill
otakon: okay. But this IS the show that broke Hideaki Anno.
night Bronysith
/me brohugs Bronysith "Night Man"
First experience of death. My friend died in my bathroom at age of 8
otakon: The tight schedule made him Stress out and become depressive later on.
argh
Alpha-Omega, wow.
According to the article Blueblood was supposed to be a Duke
Looks like Captain Global
otakon: we got the BAD NGE. Rebuild is better.
I miss him.
NHK?
Conspiracy :o
otakon: It's supposed to end better than the original. or the past of the universe. It's still very Mind Screwy there.
My Uncle Sam died when I was five.
Polydunami, He needed you.
I can't believe I had an Uncle Sam of all things xD
damn smart kid
oh it's wanted.....
being able to map out the island
I like NGE. It's the mindscrewy enough to be fun. And I like Shinji.
NGE was the first anime I owned on DVD. I absolutely love the show (minus the last 2 episodes). I thought Death & Rebirth and EoE were okay, but I absolutely love the Rebuild movies.
that's....creepier
crazy ass steampunk tanks
I called him Grandpa because my real grandpa died ten years before I was bown.
I'm going to bed good night
night SpadeMagnes[R]
Goodnight SpadeMagnes
OtakuTom: Rebuild Shinji vs EoE Shinji. WHO WINS?
Good nht
Evangelion was meant to be a deconstruction of mecha series at the time.
mail hawtler?
loud kid
otakon: Wrong. Rebuild Shinji wins and THEN we die.
Oooh...uhhh...tough question...
why can never just read his thoguhts so he doesnt have to make sounds
It's amazing how so many notable examples of pretty much any genre is a deconstruction of it. And this works in the west as well.
Who, Jean?
OtakuTom I like SRW Alpha Shinji too.
would make more sense and also be less loud
It's a DESERT
welp he's dead
Jean is a bit of a badass.
SRW Alpha...oh Super Robot Wars? I can't say I've seen or played any SRW other than the one DS game that was released in the US.
Yep
so, that group moved in and captured the local populace huh?
Gundam was a deconstruction of Super Robot, Macross was a parody of mecha, Nadesico was a parody of Real Robot, Evangelion was a dark deconstruction of Super Robot..... Madoka Magicka was a dark deconstruction of Magical Girl Warrior.
bullets shatter on impact on the surface of the water as tested by mythbusters
Kandarihu: dear God Madoka, neve NEVER want to read it
Alpha-Omega: yh at 6 feet
Alpha-Omega: Don't forget Bullet Types
Alpha-Omega: his head was still above the water
he wasn't deep enough
OtakuTom: He got Bright-Slapped in Alpha and then saved Asuka from the MPEvas. When I played Alpha 3 he was my favourite Unit.
otakon, Madoka Magicka is anime first. The manga is an adaptation of the anime.
11,02Dat dancing
Kandarihu: never.want.to.see.it.too.depressing.
LAWL
Oooh...Madoka Magicka...I'm just starting to watch that.
I'm only on episode 2
OtakuTom: Have fun
DO NOT GET SPOILED
Jean and Nadia SO want to jump each others bones.
I can FEEL the UST.
I was about to say something that would probably not be a spoiler for any other series but WOULD be a spoiler for this.
hate to say it folks
I want to watch this but gotta go
it's 2 am here
11,02Okie, later otakon :3
I also need to catch up with Total Eclipse, So I Can't Play H, Brave Sword Online, and Campione (among others)

Don't worry, find it on your own time :3
I'm not complaining about time

Shizuka: you?

Shizuka: good luck dear, I'm off to bed.
Shizuka, I should hope it's a FttH startup in your town.
Take care all! See you tomorrow sometime eh?
at least I hope.
11,02Then again, Comcast has been flawless for me lately >>
One does not simply "OP".
frick.

Borrowed...
is that the only rank this server has?
Vordox: it's nicer than saying stole.
or do you have p-ops, h-op?
That squeak was cute X3
DO I SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH IN THE ENEMY TERRITORY!?
I'll bet those power conduits are insulated.
What if Jean were voiced by Samuel L. Jackson?
Why do I think that Jean's accent is too forced?
Kandarihu: 120 years ago?
French accent and everything? xD
Vordox, good point.
I also think the same
... Allegedly :S
00,10kick there colective asses Shizuka
Polydunami: he overuses it though. It SOUNDS forced.
...
YES
hm
Yea, I really don't like his voice.
that animalcrossing Creepypasta shure did hit a curveball with the story...dint see it coming O_O
She's kind of a badass

... Apparently
U R DED
Wait...an anime featuring a girl with enough decency to hold her skirt down even when there's nearly no chance of someone getting a peek up it? Such a thing surely doesn't exist :P
yah, you derps
at least these kids are logical
you know
11,02U R ALIVE
Either that or I've gotta stop watching harem comedies :P
they knew what it was when they got in it

and forgot about what happens to fuel

most cartoons i watch they would just keep running until it gets shut off
OtakuTom, I like to see modest girls anyway
I looked Nadia up on TvTropes and am saddened I can't find a Character Page.

Oh geeze
Quick_Thinker: damn

DAT SLAP WAS JUSTIFIED BY ALL MEANS
i dint expect him to do that
Later everypony

Mishia: He's a sciencetist

Mishia: he's a 13 year old boy. I wasn't better at that age.
Any kind
Something interesting = Learn

You perv Mishia
^ waht?
you know what mystical artifacts do to people .+.
I don't understand women and girls
I don't want to miss this, but I gotta sleep
Always so pervy
*shakes head*
drive them insane
This show is better than I remember it being. I stopped after the first 4 episodes a long time ago and never watched the rest.
Vordox: that wasnt ment that way
Mishia: I only know they are known to possess or outright kill people.
Mishia: Too late =P
Vordox: ......
well i was gonna play some new Pony songs on Stepmania but they can wait
00,10I have an anime that is kinda alot like this one only more mind fucky
Mishia: OR they grant you awesome Superpowers with which you protect your friends and save the world.
What anime, Sumi?
00,10Fractal
Mishia: buuuuut hes not the owner of that amulet!
or they can change you into a Pony :D
sound like my kind of anime
What a random looking band of misfits
Quick_Thinker: BEST.CURSE.EVER
Can't say I've seen that one...lol
00,10might stream an ep if there is time
if thats the case the artfact is awesome
the heck are we watching?
Quick_Thinker: but only if its a MLPFIM pony. i mean, if you turned into a normal pony, it would suck.
of course it would
You know. If it wasn't that bad, as in it doesn't explain the reason for a character Motive, I would suggest someone to stream Fate/Stay Night: The Anime.
It's kind of strange how the Grandis Gang is grouped with the Nadia troupe in the very OP.
the heck we watching?
11,02I hope I can download the rest of the episodes of this show after I finish through all the DVDs
i mean, i only like ponies as in MLPFIM ponies. they are gorgeous and are acutally fun to be
so would being turned into a G3.5 PONY i would just end it all then and there
SuperBrony64: Or buy ? :)
i mean, they have perks!
The heck we watching?
Eulshy, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water
OtakuTom: Fank you
To be honest, I'm kind of partial to the kinds of anime that NHK shows. It doesn't rely on fanservice or lots of action or flashy mecha design. There's a sense of purity to series like that.
NO
NOT THE KID!
is that a cat?
11,02Vordox: Well...it's old ><
Lion, actually. A cub
dont say anything
00,10kerbals are made of darkmater
11,02O.O
lol
00,10they fall faster then the ship they jumpfrom
O.o
OtakuTom, you have that prepped don't you? and Sabershy: First LOVE THE NAME and second, it would spoil many of the reveals and twists of Fate/Stay Night.
So technically a cat still
O______________O
GOD IN A ANIME! BLASTPHAMY!
lol no
11,02O_O;;;
How about Belldandy? :3
D:
damn this guy doesnt fuck arounf
dat lion cub
you know this doesnt work
Nadia's picking a lie and sticking to it.
if you kill her, you will never get it
you tard
wait doesnt she want to die to go to heaven? just saying
00,10he kinda reminds me of amon
Have what prepped, the title?
In the ocean O_O
like if you have one hostage and you threaten him
Sabershy: I AM watching Fate/Zero on my own right now. Since I played the original VN. Which actually EXPLAINS WHY Shirou is the Hero type he is.
kid is fucked
So what is this show about exactly?
and he turns on you, and slaps you. what can you do? he walks out and you shoot him DERP now yours screwed
Is there an English version of the Fate/Stay Night VN?
I am not a mouse, I AM A FRENCH
^
Eulshy: it's loosely based on 20,000 Leagues under the sea.
Like an official one?
the villians are trapped by villians??!?
too bad team rocket
O_O
NOTHING TROLLOLOLOL
What's 20,000 leagues under the sea?
11,02He actually reminds me of Lazarevic from Uncharted 2
LAWL
wow
huh
OtakuTom: I think the MirrorMoon Translation is as Official as you can get.
loooooooooooooooooooool
"I'm the ambiguously gay one, by the way."
Ah
Team rocket wannabes are apparently very good fakers
I'm still hoping a company like MangaGamer localizes it. I picked up the Higurashi games and Shuffle from them.
EARTHQUAKE
Quick_Thinker: they inspired team rocket.
oh did not know that
Quick_Thinker: so wannabes? hell no
Sabershy: Who's your favourite Servant in 1: F/SN and 2: F/Z?
whutizzles
team rocket originals
oh Mishia its the first time i've seen this anime give me a break
Making like Indy, huh?
Vordox: :D
Quick_Thinker: i am :3 i just decided to ARRRTAKKK u
I will hide in this train car full of oversized lego
Team Rocket are Griger Gang wannabees
ITS GENIUS
/me pounces Quick_Thinker for good messure
Mine are 1: GARcher and 2: Gilgamesh. Shiki is from Tsukihime. He doesn't count.
why are they treating her this way???????????????????
/me why did you pounce me are you a pony cat ?
wine?
Bitch, food is food, just shut up
:)
Nadia is vegetarian.
XD
MAMAMMAMAMMAMAMAMMAMAMA
hey its the lego tain!
Vordox: If he's in the anime, haven't watched it. Or do you mean in the Heaven's Feel Route of the game? Haven't finished that one yet.
GIANT LEGOS
:$
huh everyone is hungry
what the
the skinny guy is the BRUTE and the fat one is the scientest. whut
Panda: So uhh... find any of RD yet?
logic wins!
Fuck
Sabershy: What are your thoughts on Zero|Rider?
Wrong chat
I've only seen 1 or 2 episodes of F/Z, but Saber in her suit has got to be one of the sexiest things I've ever seen.
RD you mean rainbowdash or something else?
Quick_Thinker: of course
why do they need giant legos
Oh man, she has no other clothes to sleep in?
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaainbooooooooooooooooow
TO BUILD A LEGO HOUSE OF COURSE
Quick_Thinker: TIME FOR THE TITLE SCREEN :3
Quick_Thinker: kinda sucks useing the same colour :l
they will paint them
Sassy princess
now shush
noname: where is your name, n0n4me
good morning 6_9
Vordox: You talking about Carnival Phantasm?
Is Sassy
You really can't step on those lego at least...but laying down on them like that has still got to be incredibly uncomfortable...lol
Mishia: it got taken away
why???
00,10oh hey the ep of cake boss from my old job is on.
what the
WHY ARE THEY BEING NICE TO HER I DONT GET IT
murders act pretty awesome
Sabershy: No Spoiling for those that haven't seen the UBW movie at leas.
Oooh...I just got UBW on bluray
Aww, shoot.
I haven't watched it yet :(
or do you mean Kiritsugu?
huh so they are atlantis people MILLO GET YOU ASS OVER HERE NOW
OtakuTom: inb4 movie with epic scenes
crazy villian nutjob
invisable walls
OtakuTom: the Archer/Shirou Fight is SQUEE!!!
Is that a dog or cat?
its a box
textiles?
I take it I should finish watching F/SN before UBW? I can't remember if I ever finished the series...it's been a while since I watched it.
noname: the invisble wall of videogames, i know the rage you feel anime girl
its actually a baby lion
That is a lion cub, magmablock
MORE LEGOS
OtakuTom: UBW is a parallell Universe to F/SN
Legos?
Nadia grew up in the circus, after all.
OtakuTom: Honestly yes. You are better off to reading the VN, but if you got no choice, watch the F/SN anime.
Okay, so it doesn't matter if I finished the series (which I should probably re-watch anyway...lol)
Eulshy: appearently, there making a lego house made of purple blocks only >_>
The Anime focuses on the "Fate" Route while UBW is the "UBW" Route.
Anyone remember the circus case from Phoenix Wright?
rock solo?
Doesn't Babel have a short a sound?
ITS PRONOUNCED THE TOWER OF BAB-EL
or not
I remember that case, Polydunami
Purple is like the 4th best color, yellow s the best
bAHHHHbel
well its offical IM TOTALLY LOST
Ah
Yeah, Regina Berry has a tiger for a pet.
That right?
Quick_Thinker: It's based on 20,000 Leagues under the Sea. Of course it has Atlantis in it.
corrupted religon is corrupted
guess thats waht i get for only seeing the 4th episode and missing the first
Quick_Thinker: Same here. Saw like the first 3 episodes here and the suddenly and Evil organization.
Bucking brony research... now I'm going to have to waste 20 hours of my life to watch all the episodes again :|
well if i knew that it would make more sense so forgive me now that i know 20,000 Leagues is involved
Rho-bits
Dovah: WASTE???
00,10the problem with the threat of death card. You only get to play it once.
Dovah: wastttteeeee??????????????????????????????
Dovah: ponys are waste? :(
How do you "waste time" watching My Little Pony?
Davah why are you watch all the episodes are you doing resaerch or something?
Sabershy: You know what would have been IMBA? Archer or Z!Archer with Berserker's "Knight of Honor"
Rule Britannia!
Quick_Thinker: he might be doing this as reserch for school.
Britannia rules the waves!
sorry can not grammer anymore to early in the morning
No I have things i need to do and I'm looking up pony/brony related things to further my knowlage on the fanbase as I have only been a brony for a month or so and now I want to watch all the episodes again.
what kind of research would it be if its MLP FIM an animation reasearch or just a fun kind of research
ah i see
Told you these guys were Nazis.
Dovah: It's hard being a good guy, right?
Yursh
I still do that but I'm learning to draw the characters as well
i've been a brony as long as 5 months and i still have missed a few episodes
SUPRISE!
dont have to go overboard
Just over a year for me
if they were nazis, they would have unloaded the car. they are italians or something like that
Deathstar?
Sorry, not you. Meant the Anime. :$
Hang on, there's an anime called Deathstar?
:3
But right now.. I need sleep and I need to pray i dont have to work tomarrow night everypony
Polydunami: No, the Cannon on Stream right now.,
good night Dovah
also in that span of 5 months i have only done a bit of contributing the community 2 fanfic and i suck at art so im not even gonna try that
XD
good night Dovah
i have
then i delted them
night Dovah
Quick_Thinker: More than I've done
2001 music suddenly
hey look the cap again
Quick_Thinker: I am now nearing my 1-year Brony Anniversary and I haven't managed ONE contribution. Except a Screencap of a Adult Pegasus with Scootaloo Colors. I called her Scootamom
also the 2 fics are one is a D&D campaign with ponys in them and the other is a crossover with Day Z and FIM
DAMN
Blammers
dat explosion
You haven't seen BLAM in this show yet.
i have not even made my OC yet
Dat Cliffhanger
^
weird anime
i kinda of made my OC in the D&D fic but my name literlay did come from the D&D thing so yeah
Let's see... I got into this show about nine months ago...
Eh, my OC is named OtakuTom...kinda makes sense :P
I got into MLP back in the 1990s. :)
His cutie mark is a video game joystick...lol
11,02One more episode or should I stream something else?
OtakuTom: My OC looks mostly like me. Including my Shirt :D
Which, if you know me, makes sense, since I plan on getting into video game development.
well i might try to draw him so far he is unicorn and his cutie mark is an apple and a test tube (gravity and Chemistry)
I'm okay with both Supr
SuperBrony64: to big of a cliffhanger, one more
And I plan to write a FanFic for months now. But I just can't get the time to start writing it seems.
More episodes?
I'm okay with both Supr
MOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?
i've been a brony for 5 months now and i haven't even contributed to the community
Nah the cliffhanger is goos for effect
What I didn't realize is how much mine looks almost exactly like Wrek's, but I made it before I knew what his looked like...lol
im delteing my story....
to wright a better one!
SuperBrony64: ...zombies
11,02Alright, one more...then maybeh Zombies 3
11,02:3*
I want to do that with my story
BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD
I haven't contributed anything worthwhile to Bronys yet
:)
Mishia i did that with my Quick Thinker story (the name came from a RPG of MLP FIM so it was a legit character i played but he wore a freaking labcoat XD
SuperBrony64: I was actually just doing a test on my own mips channel. just set black ops to windowed and turn down the resolution a tiny little. (though you probably already know this... >__>)
I've been planning to write a Human in Equestria fic for a while, now. One that is actually good.
00,10good luck Polydunami
good luck and try to get the emotions right
00,10I have only seen 2 that I like
what type of zombies?
^
Not saying I'm actually going to write it.
well the zombie one im doing is the Day Z / MLP FIM crossover so far its on the 5th chapter
I'm just saying maybe.
00,10they have a satlight weapon?
00,10oh hey it's captan gloval
Won't work if it's self-insert.
Capitan Nemo, on duty ~
I planned to write a Fic where Tirek (The Evil before Discord took over) returns and the Mane 6 have to recruit the help of all other Races to combat it.
learned it the hard way never do a self insert the FIM fic people hate those
00,10ehhhhh, Cardslaugher has got it to work imo Polydunami
ah
Reminds me a bit of Skies of Arcadia
*crack*
Namely the evil empire with the weapon of mass destruction, magical gemstones, etc.
Mine sounds to farfetched to share so I'll keep it to myself
mine was based entirely off the MLP roleplaying is magic CAMPAIGN BY THE AgentKalim THAT HAS NOT EVEN STARTED AND IM STARTING TO THINK HE QUIT ON US GOD DAMNIT
00,10castle in the wind is alot like this too
Sky?
00,10could be yeah Polydunami
It is.
is Laputa on?
seriously agent kalim i think at this point said fuck the RPG and left us :[
00,10wait.......is that the same VA that did shinji in the US dub of EVA
I don't think Spike Spencer did any voices in Nadia...which character are you talking about?
00,10the boy
No, that's not him. I keep forgetting the name, even though it's been in the credits, but I know it's not Spike Spencer.
11,02Dat Atlantis
has any one seen AgentKalim on since say last month
Its to bad it sank
the barbarian girl can't appreciate art anyway...what a waste of time
The ADV English version was voiced by Nathan Parsons
11,02He already said the Boy's name...

Alpha-Omega: Lesson Zero
00,10want it need it Alpha-Omega
Eh, it was ok
11,02I think it might be better to stream something else. Rather than stream the next few episodes and be teased with a cliffhanger :3
Sanson at the wheel was the best thing in the episode.
i found the song :3
i give this anime so far a lego train/10
stream two hours of scootaloo
SuperBrony64: ...:D
Sanson/10 from me.
giant pink lego blocks/10

I give this anime an island/10 :|
So...

Polydunami: THIS IS PONYS :[

MW3 Campaign?
hmm mw3 havnt touched that in a while
I like pi
black ops
Oh no, Black Ops campaign
00,10dat is some painfull font
According to Steam it says SuperBrony64 is in game Call of Duty Black Ops :P
^
nuuuu
Holy shit, look at all those tabs.
^
So...
Anyone read any good stories lately?
no. I've drawing
THE NUMBERS, MASON.
Anyone write any good stories?
so does anypony know SuperBrony64 steam i want to add him :3
Not yet :3
Want to read my story?
makes me wanna go watch some Black Ops 2 stuff
Black Ops was Mind Screwy the first time I played it.
I just updated it after several months
And now I go onton hiatus once again
I was honestly surprised by the Twist.
What a twist
[SWAG]Haku: whats the story about?
Stuff
Random stuff
why not 120hz?
well i wrote this http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&search=Day+Z
120hz monitors are expen$ive
its not that great in my opion but ehh
11,02Quick_Thinker: You can add me, it's SuperBrony64
Basially, a bunch of random characters from different shows and movies and books are appeaering in equestria
Not many people right now though
I got three Autobots, Rorschach, Deadpool, And Hulk/Dr. Banner
wasn't there that GoogleDoc that listed the Bronystate Steam/Orign/XBoxLive Names?
Quick_Thinker: i'll give it a read :)
And also Boba Fett
Boba Fett is awesome
That list should still exist, but it's a bit buried within the site news.
I have a set number of villains to appear in a short while
I only liked black ops for zombies. Online was a pain also slow.
also for anypony wondering i write it in my spare time when im not doing my day time job as a cahsier or working at home on other things
I could post the link. I saved it.
Quick_Thinker that's... nice?
so the chapters some times take awhile to get uploaded and written
I has alot of freinds on Steam :$
http://youtu.be/NzjcS0DRxog
Anyone else bankrupted by the steam summer sale?
Haku doesnt have Steam
I have...uhh...like...7 or 8 friends on steam...lol
00,10bleh I like this comic but it's sooooooo slow to update
It doesnt work on my labtop
Ponies47: how many?

Nope, I spent nothing during the sale :P

Ponies47: become an admin and you'll double that :)

hmmm.... my bro has this on his laptop
also i wrote one other fic but its not ponys but eh what the hell here it is http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7005799/1/RioGascar this was my first ever fan fic so it might suck
they are all offline TROLL
Time for some Robotron/Smash TV clone! :D
classic arcade style :)
its a crossover with Rio and Madagascar
Quick_Thinker: i finnished a prolouge for one non-pony. Its called "Living Free"
ohai Ponies47
eh i never finished just kinda of ran out of ideas but im thinking i might try to finish it
Quick_Thinker: My First ever FanFic was a Naruto/Godzilla Crossover called "Narut The Kaiju Summoner". I haven't updated in Years now and can't get any inspiration to continue.
I think Ive read that ine
one
What happened in it?
well actually i remember RioGascar being quite popular everyone said i got the personalities down
Naruto met those Fairies and they let him sign the Kaiju Summoning Contract.
oh
Well, Im actually thinking about putting Godzilla in my story\
lol wut
It ends before the Chuunin Exam Arena Match.
We're so mature.
And then Naruto summons GOdzilla and is crowned Kings of kages?
I'm either gng to bed now or playing black ops. bye
Cya AO
I had three naruto stories going beofre I discontinued them all
My first was a NAruto/Demonata cross over
Quick_Thinker: i gave you a review. I dont have much to help you on, only basics. I dont understand what it is about so obviously im sorry that i cant help more
No, I planned big fights for him. Like King Gidorah. or other Aliens.
I had no idea what to do after the first chapter
My second was a "Naruto going to an AU" thing, where Orichimaru was actually a good guy
[SWAG]Haku: I also wish i could help you...im to unfamilar with it to be of help :(
lol
[SWAG]Haku: Mine has 8 Chapters. And a small Harem for Naruto.
My 3rd was by far my most popular
It was a Naruto-Gaara friendship sorta thing where both met up as children
I canceled it after the 4 chapter i think
And I was actually able to write some prety good stuff
then I tried a A:TLA Naruto Cross. It wasn't that bad. Naruto: Rebirth of the Elements.
Even wrote several "IZ/Disney" crossovers
OH GOD
well, more like "IZ/Disney songs" corssoevrs
[SWAG]Haku: the comdey wrights itsekf,,,
It sorta does
/me Hugs Mishia for the review and then punch him becuase its discontinued
They were all really just songfics
Then I had my SW:KOTOT phase. I tried a Kotor/Clone Wars Cross. Never got past Ch.1
though, where the IZ characters sang classic disney songs
/me slaps Quick_Thinker :3 also im a girl.
they be raped
Such as Tak sing "Reflection" from Mulan
ZATR
;)
I ship it
I am a major ZATR person
Look at that, Misha. You slapped Quick_Thinker so hard he disconnected :P
Then I like ZAGF
nope the chat derped
Eh, I never like Gaz
err...Mishia*
nice job Mishia, now hes gone :(
lol [SWAG]Haku they hate eachothers guts. how can they be shipped??
I prefered it when she wasnt in a story
WHAT?! Gaz was my favorite character!
so i had to refresh it can you say that again Miashia
He logged back in, noname :P
OtakuTom: yay
Quick_Thinker: .-. im a chick. lol
Mishia: She was supposed to comeback as a regular Character. And the Shippers always ship.
apparently i got slapped so heres a rocket to the face MUAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAH
Mishia There are ways. People always put the two together in ways where they have to work together. Not to mention both are defects, so they dont have much other them each other
[SWAG]Haku: true...no shipping is bad if it has a good reason and buildup to them being togather
well Mishia i did not know you were female my appoligies
The Rebellion was supposed to play a larger role too. But the series was canceled.
Quick_Thinker: lol its fun suprising people
Mishia: Surpriiiiise! :$
just saying another nonon in FIM no Alicorns it really pisses them off
sadly, yes we do
:<
Steam lost it's connection I had to log out and back in. I hate it when that happens >_<
MadSurge: ZOMG! surge!
dat money
/me hhuggles MadSurge
Sorry Mishia. I confused you for Misha. *hits self in head* My early morning on coffee.
MadSurge: im about to go to bed lol
Put some ZATR in it to confuse the fans
[SWAG]Haku: your stories sound good.
Mishia: goodnight then!
[SWAG]Haku: now i really wanna read them :$
My story is not good, it is the opposite of good
/me hugs Mishia. "Night."
/me hugs back
Mishia: night

It's by the guy who made The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack

but did you learn from that video if you play D&D you might want to learn from it YOU NEVER WANT TO SPLIT THE PARTY EVER
Wander over Yonder seems like a fun idea.
Ponies47 Oh, well, my bad
Though I did balk for a moment at the villain being named "Lord Hater".
Ponies47 ~and I am here to say~

Hmmm...no responses here...maybe my internet derped...

Wut
OtakuTom: All good on my part
I think I lost internet for about 30 seconds to a minute...I saw him sitting at his computer, and now I'm back after refreshing.
Stram is fine here.
dat run
OtakuTom: You also had a sudden flood of messages
Aww, someone's in love <3
Yea...then my connection derped
seems he underestimated rule 1 of zomebieland
Someone is out of shape.
FOREVER ALONE!
Dken2021: Sadly i got a condition that actually inhibits my ability to run for long and what not
breathe child breathe
I think I missed something, though...when my connection came back, the first thing I saw was MasterBoss saying mind f*yay*k
creepy 0_0
killerpony7733 ah ok
Big Brother!
RUN
Don;t worry OtakuTom, It did not cut out or me but I'm STILL as lost as you are.
But you where forever alone boy.
Dken2021: Would you know what the condition for when you got a chest that bends outwards?
Holy crap, Wind Waker much?
You'll always be!
WTH, how did she get away?
I agree, wind waker calls ahoy
No, but I think I missed some sort of detail during that minute I wasn't getting stream.
did i miss something
00,10she is a dopple noting can realy hold her.
killerpony7733 no, never heard of that ctually
DED
Dken2021: It's called pigeons chest, Due to resemblence. But it
fool, never underestimate a random treasure chest in the open
it's negative effects are a asthma like condition
Team Rocket Blasts off a the speed of light
How did they not notice a big f#cking balloon?
I have less lung capacity and what not
00,10he did notice it
Dken2021: if I see a chest, I must open it! There's no other way!
00,10the girl however is rather "simple"
killerpony7733 I knwo how that feels, I've got ashtma as well
Sumica: I think i saw it before...

Let's watch some Madoka instead
00,10lol madoka
acid trip
Dken2021: Yeah, Due to my chests shape it's closest type of relation to asthma is being a like the mild type, But be damned it's taking a toll for my overall body's ability to do things
Sumica: scare the crap out of magical girl lovers
:D
Hmm, Ghost in the Shell, Dragonball?
00,10but that would take like 3 eps
Sumica: :D
I'm only on episode 2 of Madoka...no spoilers plz.
OtakuTom: you're in for a treat my friend.
That's what everyone says
killerpony7733 doubt it's something that weakens over age, right?
/me looks at the anime and wonders what the heck is playing?
Dat visor
Dken2021: Considering my chest stays in this shape no it wouldn't though the conditition can be outgrown for a good deal, Meaning chest goes back into shape. Else i would need surgery to fix it
RUN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION DUMBASSES

If I'm understanding it correctly, this village can't see her because they don't have the implants.
Lil_B: Yeah...I wished you a good night after it ...Oo
So they have to use the visors to see her.
Lil_B: Was about 5h ago...
Just feed the air!
Lil_B: You should have told her to take the bike..
red_ony: or bus..

You're too slow! Gotta go fast!
killerpony7733: But that's more friends than the amount of friend Twilight have! *Trollface*

Sumica: Yeah, i actually learned of ponies during around ep 10 or 20 at around S1, And i found the site during when it was only a few months old most likely
00,10will try
Sumica: I can wait
BUFFALO!
:(
Audio lag
/me wants to know when session 3 starts so he can mark his calander.
Awkward levels rising
killerpony7733: Been around since early July last year. Became brony at S1 e6
probably around the same time people go bacvk to school
00,10I forgot it was usd for a fic so it was easy to find
00,10http://tinyurl.com/44sasw4
Noir: It's been confirmed sometime around september or later
Never trust rumors like EQD
yay, her first rival!
Very_Silly_Filly s1 ep6 ?! how eraly did the whole Brony thing start?
Lil_B: Well the show started in 2010
Sumica: that's incredible :$
http://xkcd.com/1085/ this should be as standard
Sumica: So is Pinkie supposed to be Kyubey?
Very_Silly_Filly I know, but I mean, how many episodes did it take to convicne people that the show is awesome?
00,10or the witch that has the sweet tooth
if your trying to force people to like MLP
your going to hav a bad time
Lil_B: I dunno, probably took something like 4-7 for most bronies
Sumica: OF COURSE *slaps forehead* :D
Very_Silly_Filly no, I mean how many episodes aired before the whole Brony-thing started
00,10why force Chrysalis when you can just show them anthology 1
00,10tis what I did
the whole "join the herd" thing is really obnoxious though
Lil_B: Well, judging by my avarage, I'd say around 5-10
I wasn't really on the internet as much as I am now back in '10
00,10I posted it on my old wow guild forum
Oh no, poor kitty thing!
00,10yes that poor thing needs help

CapTaIn_MasterBoss43: -lol
Lil_B: I don't even have breakfast here! :(
00,10taling off camera and brain talk is great for the budget
I'll guess Coffe counts as breakfast...
CapTaIn_MasterBoss43 where?
Lil_B: hah! you're eating healthily? i had 4 pancakes for breakfast with syrup
BronyInstrumental: I had carrot cake
I'm gonna go for a run later because of that
:3
00,10cheese dainish
00,10homemade
Lil_B: Skogså (Sweden, Norrbotten) But that's because they forgot to buy breakfast goddammit.
BronyInstrumental nope... only these Nutella filled Cereals with some Milk... thats not healthy XD
F#CKING BUFFERS! JUST STOP IT DISCORD!
Fun fact: Italian VA for Sayaka voices Fluttershy and Applejack :D
I think I am having breakfast too..I still have this delicious pumpkinseed bread :D
MadSurge the one who screamed in the once scene like shes getting stabbed?
00,10it's little sluggers bat
I've never had pumpkin seed, what's it like?
tasty?
Lil_B: nooo, the blue haired girl!
Aww :(
MadSurge I mean in one scene of MLP :P
You could always try to build a bride to test for witches
What's it taste like?
Salty?
what is it with Japan and the short skirts..do they have cloth shortages there?
Lil_B: I think you mean the spanish dub :D haven't heard the Scream from italian dub yet :D
red_ony: Welcome to anime, enjoy the stay
MadSurge oh, yeah, the spanish dub it was than... sorry
No, but it makes cosplay fun from an observer's standpoint :P
Deuscht language! CALL FOR VIVI
deutsch? where? Did I miss it?
Lil_B: it was written on the wall
00,10clearly she put points in fast transformations
She caught her with fire?
btw Japan appearently LOVES the german language... I have no clue why
There it was!
Well German is a great language after all.. :D
MadSurge I saw it :D
Lil_B: also, Italian
:D
I want her rifle
red_ony: Thats all you've noticed? -lol It doesnt ever strike you that they all damn near have the same voice just at different ctives they speak. Or that some are apparently born with blue hair? Or that in some shows ex. bayblade, People are dying in iraq but a kid with a fucking plastic top with a small metal ring in it can break crators in cement with that toy? And dont even get me started about soccer in anime. -lol
It's very nice
red_ony yes, but they just use it because... "Well.. lets use the same word... in another language... so it appears like it has a deeper meaning..."
burn the witch
Other languages are cool :D
someone pinged me? my chat derped..
Liokin-Bot: more like ANY sport in anime :P
Unnerving animation style!
A witch looks a lot like a paper cut out animated...
intresting animation style
red_ony yes, but they just use it because... "Well.. lets use the same word... in another language... so it appears like it has a deeper meaning..."
i have no idea what i'm watching, but i like this soudtrack
red_ony just to repeat my messege :)
OtakuTom: -lol
Lil_B: :)
Dark_Horst yes, the soundtrack appears to be rather good
Weird stick thing is now cannon apparently.
Dark_Horst: Puella Magi Madoka Magika :D
MadSurge: gesundheit
Liokin-Bot have you never seenn "Saki"
that shows about mahjong
and is AWESOEM
guns always solve everything
TIRO FINALE!
Chrysalis: The achoholic drink? Or some type of anime?
00,10I have saki
00,10it's awsome show
What the hell is this? An anime or a cyriak video?
Sumica IKR, never before has a tile game been so amazing
did she just kill the flying spaghetti monster and turned it's corpse into butterflies?
and again... why not just say Finish? ... or the japanese ford for Finish?... WHy Finale?
DED WITCH
Lil_B: because italian sounds cooler! :D
Lil_B its cooler that way
00,10"rule of cool"
MadSurge "Finale"->german XD
yeah, we dot hat
But Tiro Finale roughly means "final shot"
MadSurge oh Oo
00,10german is often used for magic attack calls
^that too
Yeah, "silhouette"
00,10germnay is often said to be the home of magic.
WUT MAD MAX O__O
Liokin-Bot of course
its DBZ style physics
Sumica I never heard of that before
shouting makes attacks stronger
MadSurge: Serious Sam
"...in the magical land of GERMANY " to quote a certain youtube video
Hi everypony! :3
00,10in mithos that is Lil_B
and the name of the attack being said massivly increases its power
Is this anime, I see?!
Liokin-Bot: the more flashy it is, the more powerful it is :D
hey Spell-of-Gaming how've you been
Well, there's also the general consensus that in most fantasy worlds, you have some sort of enchantment that you have to say in order to cast a spell.
Time for backstory!
red_ony dikekike made the best YTP :)
00,103 ways to cast
This seems familiar...
00,10full spell, speed spell and no call
MadSurge: Obviously. I wonder if these "LITTLE GIRLS" Even fear basica man made wepaonry. A gun probably looks like a water gun to them.
True
decreasing in power
Spell-of-Gaming: Puella Magi Madoka Magica!
OMG YES.

I have my Kyubey face on, just in case. :3
dredded ep3?

Well time for me to sleep, Goodnight everyone, thanks for the stream Sumica ~

Ehhh....That rabbit creeps me the buck out.
dshannon: Puella Magi Madoka Magica

Sumica: Yup. ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
Liokin-Bot: you have no idea :D

OtakuTom: so this is where you arrived, huh?

Come home saused and cursing in front of your supernatural with killing daughter and your stay at home husband.

/me lives in a country where Japan is closeby

Were in equestria are the policemen?? How is it no one is around to notice the school girls (IN UNIFORM) standing in this clearly public place.
so can noone else see kyuubi
IIRC, nobody else can see him, alexxm
00,10only those he wants to see him can see him
thanks OtakuTom
Kyuubey manages to be cute and creepy at the same time.
Cue-Beh
Spell-of-Gaming: yep
I don't find him creepy at all
Oh sweet celestia...Its like alice in wonderland took a trip to hell....
At one point, he manages to be creepy, yes, only creepy.
I take it that happens later, then?
i guess so
OtakuTom: yeah
Morning Phase4 :)
Horee sheet'
Giant cookie :3

Got my things finished
Yay, they imprisoned the EEEEVIL magical girl!

00,10her magic weapon is highexplosives

Sumica: HAAAXXX
I love how schools in anime give no fucks if a student dies.
Also in visual novels.
she would make tokusatsu proud
00,10and that was ep 3
And now the girl is going to wish her back alive
Boooooo
That was sad
oh well
Not to sound like a jerk but that girl was kinda arrogant
She got cocky
She got beheaded.
...I missed it...
I just got back to the computer...
sonofa
00,10oh you missed it?
Derpdash: you have no idea where it goes into
Yea, with the whole restraining the other magic girl she kind of had it coming
00,10well in that case
I wonder if schools in anime and visual novels give fucks about the allegedly died student.
Yea. I got pulled away from the computer and missed about the 2nd half. I'll watch it later.
Sumica: I smell replaeeey
Sumica: YES
The last I saw, the black-haired girl was being tied up by the blonde
OtakuTom: WATCH THIS
Slice
Way to lose your head Mami
oh damn
MadSurge: Angel Beats was really sad too
Well...my prediction was half-right
How is that thing a him?
I expected it to be...what's her name...the blue-haired girl.
Sayaka?
Kanon is probably the first time anime made me emotional. :P
Derpdash: but was it soul-crushing depressing?
MadSurge: Too me it was
to
8]
So in her transformation she gets boots?
But then at the same time, I kinda saw Mami not lasting long after learning her backstory earlier in the episode.
00,10I need some happy now
Sumica: Call upon the sea ponys?
Sumica: Don't wory, badum, badum be happeh
Okay...so why did people say this was messed up? It's only episode 3. The viewer really should have no connection to Mami.
Sumica: but it was so happy!
:D
YES.
:D
This show was just pure win in it's day
:D
LOL
Good night everyone. Enjoy your day/night.

MY BRAIN IS HAVING AN ANNUERISM BRB
Meh.
Sumica: do people know where the original animation comes from? :D
00,10always makes me grin
The original animation comes from a visual novel. :D
00,10if they dont then they should have their internent card revoked
-lawl
i like the original swedish version cuz u CAN NOT UNHEAR the "lyrics"
Sumica: For threatening to lose their internet card,you lose the internet!

The School Days anime was horrible IMO.
Liokin-Bot
Liokin-Bot: That's a good goal :D

Derpdash: Of course bro. Of course.
Spell-of-Gaming: too much depressing?
Otherness: I mean I would be like an assassin or something. I would be a hero -lol not some random killer.

alexxm: a bullet hell games series with a lot of following
How do you Mods stay awake for this long? Is it an energy drink, because I would really want some of that! :)
All the remixes! <3
Is it TouHou Isnt it?
MASF123: Sheer will power
but like a parody
Derpdash: yep
This is a fangame spin-off of Touhou

TO THE MOOOOOOOON
I loved TouHou
This character!
'dat skybox
MASF123: Depends on where you live in the US it's relatively close to midnight now

..................all this for a fucking soccor goal?
then 1 million people in the city just died
MASF123: 35 minutes past lunch meaning half a hour till it's 1PM here
You think this is overpowered? Nope, not overpowered for Touhou. Infact, nothing is overpowered in Touhou. :P
A wild ominous tower appears!
Sumica: that ball must be made of unobtainium to resist all that
Bass cannon
No, I made the ball
killerpony7733, are in Germany?

FUJIYAMA VOLCANO.

alexxm: Haha!
FLANDRE!
alexxm: Indeed
Flandre!!! YESSSS
killerpony7733, i don't take effort in anything, which is why I haven't done anything yet. :D
Scarlet sisters!

MASF123: Pffft silly filly :P
I'm really confused why Flandre never came back for a second appearance in the official games, almost everyone loved her.
:)
goalie's just like: ".......SHIT.
Wow....That is the worst goalie in the world.
Spell-of-Gaming: because Zun is a troll? :D
Broken foot inbound!
MadSurge: Maybe he's too drunk to remember. :D
So the newsletter is telling me there are, in fact, 3 additional Star Wars films. Surely this isn't right, though?

Heya everypony!
Hello there.
Hello Zanon
Morning, dudes! :)
MegaMoonShine: Morning

Its faster to throw the sandwitch and grab it for the health.
Anypony knows the ip?
CapTaIn_MasterBoss43: Add phase on steam and join him through that
But i keep getting a bug that says i don't have any game so i can't add friends, i got like 14 games!
So he will need to add ME on steam! :'(
So just ask him to add you then
But i don't think he will add me for shitzeling my ditzel!
Well I am off to the library now..:) I'll just leave the PC and bronystate open...
Baii, red_ony!
Later red_ony :)
Read good books red_ony! ;)
hello ma brony's \o/ :)
hai everypony :)
So little ponies who's talkin right now...

/me hugs ninja
Hello ninja and Michael :)
/me hugs MegaMoonShine
Anypony wanna play a game, add me on steam : masterboss43
More information will i send when i get to know thooseponies.

Derpdash: Vid links are frowned upon here :|
oh srry MegaMoonShine :(
srry everypony... :(
Derpdash: Nah it's only during streams vid links are not allowed
Derpdash: post vid links when theres no stream
Derpdash: In all curiousity how new are you here then?,
just 3-4 days now
However, you can link video links during stream with the permission of the streamer. :3
Derpdash: Did you read the rules and FAQ?
Just seeing if you did
......no.
ill go read them now :(
da sacred rules
Derpdash: FOR THE LOVE OF CELESTIA AND LUNA do it, It's not fun to get kicked for not knowing it
It happens all to often, :(
You can't blame them though, almost nobody reads the FAQ and Rules in other sites. :I
Also the Terms of Agreement.
Yeah, true
Spell-of-Gaming: I will say for some it's due to laziness or just being plain stupid, Though some think since the community is friendly and all we don't have any rules or something
Though the Terms of Agreement happens more than the FAQ and Rules
lol
Still it's common for newcomers to think not know there are actual rules and what not
Still the most facehoof inducing thing is when a regular breaks rules :D
Actually, the most facehoof inducing thing is when you fail tab use. :D
Sorta, I still find the idea of a regular who knows the rules and everything just breaks the rules
stupid
We are the people who are mean't to set examples for the newcomers
I'm actually pretty kind IRL, but I put things I complain about almost here. :D
Hey ponies, I'm back
And do I always have to come back to a bloody debate?
Wb Very_Silly_Filly :)
hai Very_Silly_Filly
Welcome back, Very_Silly_Filly :3
Apparently yes, Very_Silly_Filly :D
I've wondered, where did you get your nickname here, Very_Silly_Filly? :P
I did go by a different name, but from personal issues, I changed it
I've been under this name for around 8 months
i have no idea whats going on...
Yeah, it's a mystery
I mean I thought TF2 was an online shooter...
Well it is, but it seems not many people are online on this map
dat surf map
but I dont know whats the gamemode in the stream
it seems more like a platforming map
hi
hai sonicandmario85
hi sonicandmario85 :)
also good morning everyponeh :3
Hmm think i'll play a match or two of tribes ascend
i been on this map before my laptop broke

Phase4: try an get a Space plane to Minmus :S
Land on earth without a parachute?

00,02Spectrum_Rush|Busy, dats a chalenge
lets do this!
why i suggested it Phase4 :D
go to alpha centauri
00,02one or three kerbals?
three
you can kill them faster
XD
i dunno
00,02one is probably easier
00,023 makes for much bigger rockets
TWENTY!
lol
00,021 will be easier, 3 will have mroe splosions
can you do 2?
00,02sonicandmario85, kinda, it would be the same as 3
so are 3 kerbals too fat for it?
00,02one it is
flip a coin
00,02has to be a plane doesnt it
brb
i see a kerbal walking at the bottum
looks awfully phallic
XD
lol
i seen sumica do it without wheels andthe whole thing exploded
good morning everyone :) how is everyone doing today ?
hi :3
That parachute breaking
Morning sergio_scriptor :)
Phase4: LIKE A BIRD!
/me waves and thanks sonicandmario85 and MegaMoonShine :)
00,02i have no clue how to build this
and there in lies the first challenge Phase4 :)
KIA Kerbal 1991-2012

00,02sergio_scriptor, not bad
OMAGOD I's MEgaMoonShine 'n Sergio_Scriptor
00,02love the eva
And back from tribes ascend
00,02parts in the same craft no longer colide with one another
00,02but everythings a little more flimsy
yay no dead chat like yesterday
00,02the large parts have a habbit of being powerfull enough to crush themselves
now the rocket cant destroy itself XD
now that this update is here i think watching Phase playing kerbal got more 40% interesting :)
Phase4: Dat rocket
:o
:D
Needs wheels
OH NO! that cant be good for anyone
XD
sergio_scriptor: That's 20% more than I expected!
MegaMoonShine: so it got 40% cooler ? :P
MegaMoonShine: Icwutudidthar
I'm tempted to play Touhou Soccer.
wait so, is this earth? or some far off planet?
Dang, Sumica. :P
This rocket needs to be bigger to get to the moon
Flyboy: Some far off planet
Sonic: that's not a rocket, that's a plane
Flyboy: Named Kerbin
Flyboy: Nope it's called kerbit or kerbin, Home of the kerbals
spell phase4 is actually streaming
are those wings backwards? XD
00,02this will not work
MegaMoonShine: so is it possible to get to earth?
00,02Otherness, there things
00,02cannards
00,02not wings
sonicandmario85: No sumica streamed stuff earlier that's what he is refering to
I dunno Flyboy :)
and re...it's so hot outside... almost 30 °C :O
sonicandmario85: I know. Awhile ago, Sumica streamed. :P
MegaMoonShine: it would be amazing :)
are the things backwards? :P
red_ony: You call that hot?
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Yes I do...I do not like heat
i guess sumica streamed while i wasnt awake XD
Flyboy: But Kerbin could be in like an entirely different galaxy or something
Phase4: are those wings backwards?
red_ony: i live in the swiss alps so it's only 20 ºc out there :)
MegaMoonShine: yeah i guess
00,02Flyboy, nope
oh kk
Flyboy: If so, then boy it would take a pretty long time :$
red_ony: tabfail
MegaMoonShine: that would have to be one helluva acheivment for it
Spectrum_Rush|Busy: Oh..my bad :D
i live close to tulsa and im in a country in tulsa called terlolten
red_ony: Were you going to ping me? :D
terolten*
is ok red_ony :)
Phase4: congratulations! you won!
Spell-of-Gaming: Maybe? :(
I just live in the plain ol' denmark very close to the city,
00,02Flyboy, : D
Landing gear problem?
i live close to the woods i hope slendy doesnt sneak up on me in my house
XD
Most of the buildings here, f.e. the library I just visited do not have air conditioning...too few hot days/year..but when it is hot I find it terrible.. Oo
i live in a town called Grindelwald in the swiss alps,i can see the eiger,jungfrau and moch mountains from my window :)
I can only see the rhine from my windows
http://pl0x.org/wallpapers/LEEROY-JENKINS.jpg
sergio_scriptor: Closest i have been to that time of mountains is Austrich? i think,
you live in a libary like twilight sparkle does :3
type*
XD
5 min walk to the rhine promenade..still can't believe how lucky I've been with this flat :D
killerpony7733: is actualy in switzerland,but i think you might see some of them in austria :)
Phase4: "hmmm... what a weird alien planet? it looks just like ours..."
sergio_scriptor: I have been on a ski trip to austrich i mean't :D
Flyboy:all planets with life look like ours
This flight is going... well :S
sonicandmario85: ... (facehoof)
Is that thing supposed to flail around like that?
And touchdown!
killerpony7733: cool,to be honest im afraid of skiing so instead of that i use a Schilita (sled) :$
Aaaaaaand...
red_ony: of course it is! its a acording to the pl- (explosion)
Phase4: ok partial success! :D
We have arrived safely...
XD
HOW DID THE KERBAL SURVIVE THAT
XD
Oh wow
bit late for the wheels
HE LIVED! :O
the landing gear won't help now..
that was like the airplae landing
sergio_scriptor: Yeah hate it too cause i just can't figure it out, I'm overall a sled kind of guy snowmobile even
look at all da little kerbals running around XD
red_ony: only god can save you now... 'haaalaluayaaa
red_ony: "shit...
i noticed that pixelated pony opens up the chat window XD
chat just died :D
erm...
....
sonicandmario85: It's phase's OC sprite
well this cant end well...
XD
Bronystate has 2 original shows: "the buffer show" and "the Phase4 impossible machines show" love both of them :)
00,02xD
sergio if you wanna buy the game its called kerbal space program
sergio_scriptor: we interrupt your programme for more buffering!
Phase4: WAit are you making a rocket that flies to a certain altitude then detach and fly the small plane attached to it?, If so THATS GENIOUS!
sonicandmario85: i know that,i tried it once :)
00,02killerpony7733, well thats the attempt :3
did the new kerbal space program add kerbals in the thing where you make the rocket?
00,02i built another like this
00,02should probably start with that
sonicandmario85: it made them hable to leave the rocket
i whould probally pt 2 giant thruster son the wings but it probaly whouldent work anyway XD
put*
what a mess :D
jk
launch it...
im still waiting the kerbal update when they enable you to build UFO's :|
hey evryone
hi Noteworthy :)
that'll work
oh cool did they update kerbal?
Noteworthy: yep :)
hey Noteworthy :)
Noteworthy: now the kerbals can leave the rocket and walk in the mun :)
Noteworthy: 0.16
thats awesome
Hi, everypony
hi Groogle :)
hi Groogle

Phase4: working with wings works a whole lot better if you switch fron hex to circle
Hi, Groogle :)
YOUR JUST IN TIME FOR DA KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM SHOW!
00,02Dark_Horst, meh
AW YEAH
sonicandmario85: i think you mean "the Phase4 impossible machine show" :)
This is gonna be dope

lol
Whut?
Dark_Horst: i will give it 4 to 10
00,02dis is not working
dat noise
OH GOD

Dagnaggit

XD
Use the friendship express
in space
This is like Top Gear but with rockets....now how would that title go like?
Groogle:but it cant fly
sonicandmario85: i know that i said the impossible machine show,beacuse Phase4's rockets are always so crazy :)
It can be easier to just make a spaceplane on the rocket pad and steer it forward instead of up.
DB_Brony: Hah top geaR!
With friendship it can
00,02i'ma launch this while i think
thrusters sometimes do it...if the rockets good enough XD
but kerbals end up dying
when it fails
YES! YES
sonicandmario85: sometimes they survive :$
yes that is true
XD
that one looks promising
YES,it's working :=D
its like a space shuttle :D
its an apollo
this might actualy get them on orbit :P
oh shit! its bending!#
sergio_scripter:or th moon
Yep, this could actually work
Uh oh
Getting into spae and steering it so it does not get pulled back down by gravity are too different things hahaha
sonicandmario85: indeed
bye bye kerbals
its tilting
oh well what chould go wrong?
XD
i think he wants it to do that
CRap

s getting on course

sonicandmario85: the kerbals are always freaking out XD
:D those poor Kerbals,

i wished i could go to las vegas,not to watch the casinos but to watch hoover damm,the place where the battle of new vegas took place between the NCR and Cesars Legion :)
:D
Noteworthy: Even funnier vegas is techinally the biggest scam place ever
yeah thats why none of the locals really gamble
Noteworthy: And the more smarter people that visit it don't
my parents dont spend money on gambeling unless they are drunk
Lots of places to get drunk in vegas
the kerbals are happy :)
00,02i'd like to point out that this is the first time i've launced this without it exploding
getting drunk in vegas is not good either,
yeah theres a bar onn every street corner

Phase4: http://derpy.me/x4v6m :)
well Phase, I can see how that might be a problem
lol
Aaand it crawled onto my tab bar.
00,02i broke physics
the moon is NOT made of cheese god didnt even make cheese humans did
OtakuTom: i dont like space. i wanna go home. i wanno go to earth. im not liking space.
Phase: your not inside :p
nvm

http://www.kerbalcomics.com/2012/06/22/episode-ten-stranded-squared/
Phase4: i guess you can say that *put's on sunglasses* you kerbals are "Lost in Space" . YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAH
Phase4: Trollestia did this!!!!
Sonicandmario85: Shhhhhhh
they are trapped there for a thousand years
OtakuTom: theres a star. and another one. star. star. star.
trollestia!!!!
You beat me to it! I was just typing that one out! XD
:D
00,02i got this
Hi Everypony!
hello Derpdash
Hi Derpdash :)
space. space. space. space. comets. orian. galaxys. space
hai Derpdash
Derpdash: Wb!
I'm home, dad! I'm proud of you, son. Dad, are you space? Yes, now we are a family again.
Hello Derpdash!
Hey Derpdash
too much space
ty guys :)
hi Derpdash :)
i feel lately that i found a really open armed type of community
Ah! I know! Quick, tell me me name of the English Dragostea Din Tei PMV!
and we have liftoff again
OtakuTom: Getting bored of space...
you guys mean so much to me now :P
Derpdash: Got a good look on the rules and the FAQ i presume? :P
Phase4: your the best at space!
I'll try to kill it with epilepsy!
Derpdash: Well we are a family
bored of space. want to go to kerbin
Flyboy: indeed he is
Derpdash: :) and you mean a lot to us to
00,02Flyboy, : D
killerpony7733: Yup I got em down now :)
GO TO THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON WHERE ITS COLD
Flyboy: as i said once Phase4 is the best rocket flyer in all of equestria :)
dark side of the moon is full of transformers
Derpdash: Great, And always remember to follow them. Look at me never been actually kicked or banned except from the auto kick for over 6 messages in 10 seconds once.
killerpony7733: k will do
I haven't even suffered from that kick, Killerpony :P
ive never been kicked
OtakuTom: I think i was a bit toooo quick for typing, Else i have had no actual kick or ban in anyway
ive been kicked several times, im a seasoned criminal.
DB_Brony:the moons actually made of molten rock in real life not cheese if it was made of cheese and it was hot on it it would melt
I got auto kicked once for spamming :$
i do have to go in 10 minutes though :(
bcuz i got band camp :/
Yea. I'm a fast typer, but I never really say anything short enough to send 6 messages in 10 seconds...lol
Derpdash: We are always around so don't worry
the moon is made of molten rock NASA has confirmed it
da mun
sonicandmario85: If it was molten, then why isn't it liquid?
killerpony: I think I've noticed that in the past 4 days :D
OtakuTom: For me it was really just attempting, Like typing slower
Derpdash: we are here 24 hours a day,stream or no stream :)
Sonicandmario85: you didn't need to write all those sentences I know that the moon isn't really made of cheese it was simply a joke. :D
Yea, even if there's no stream going on, there's still people in chat (though activity in chat tends to drop when there's no stream)
now to the earth :D
Derpdash: Also common tip, Type a bit of someones name then press tab it auto completes and pings them
Very_Silly_Filly:it was once and so was our earth
what's on friday night?
I still haven't done that, killerpony7733 (yes, even then I manually typed it out :P)
killerpony7733: like this?
I know that, but most of the moon isn't molten right now
Derpdash: Yes like that
00,02suddenly planet
killerpony7733: oh ive always typed the names out xD
underscores and everything
linx: i will have the movies Drak Crystal and Flash Gordon :)
Derpdash: OtakuTom Generally it saves time to type with tab so i use it due to that
Which means i do not have to worry about capital letters or things
oh my god they are getting back to kerbin successfully
killerpony7733: Yeah ill say
sergio_scriptor: thanks :)
Derpdash, the problem with the tab thing is some of us have similar usernames. The best example is myself and otakon, who is not on right now, but people tend to mistakenly ping him by typing out 'otak-TAB'
playin some tom petty now for this
free fallin
i just loved last week friday and saturday night,the movie wore just awesome,especialy the asterix one :)
HES MOVING TO THE OTHER SIDE
sergio_scriptor: asterix is awesome
OtakuTom: I have a few accidental tabs but else i usually look at the name i'm auto completing and keep tabbing till i get it right
Michael: indeed :)
oh i didnt even realize Phase was streaming till i saw the rocket scientist pony :p
so did the stream end?
is it buffering for anyone else ?
Yeah me
me too
yes
It's buffering for me, but Phase would have said something if the stream was actually over.
aww i hope it didnt end :'(
Derpdash: I know most mods/streamers by heart so no problem knowing who usually
welll if it's over,thanks for streaming Phase4 :)
stop bufeer time
damn buffer
i think if it doesnt say on air its not on
i usually refresh if it buffers :/
But, but it didn't finish!!
but its not working this time
It's more likely that his streaming program stopped responding.
refresh away
Derpdash: Yet a common and smart thing to do
yep*
00,02OtakuTom, nope
Or his internet connection derped, which is why he just had to log in and ghost himself out.
Phase4:why did you shut off the stream?
00,02OtakuTom, my brother was asked to reset the breaker
Will phase make a successful landing back on Kerbin? Tune in next week to find out!
ah
lol
00,02but none of them were triggered
Allo everypony.
:(
00,02so he triggered one
00,02and then reset it

*wagner
\(^^\) |(^^)| (/^^)/
Flyboy: Others? you are not talking right, No one is allowed to anyone that does it usually haven't checked the rules or can't see the stream and think it's not on. So you are not correct
／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼﻿
gotta make international space station
yes i'm crazy
Michael: that would be cool
killerpony7733: oh ok. well i wont put any more up :)
i like pinkie pie but i like rainbow dash and derpy tooo actually i like all the characters XD
Next song?
even fluttershy and twilight
Flyboy: you might not have seen it but i was also not told to put the music for background
Flyboy: Alright good to know, Just remember if rules says it is so it's is no exceptions
Cmc dubstep remix by DJ alex s.
^pls
killerpony7733: thanks for the mercy :)
...last night i dreamed i was a time lord with my own TARDIS,and my name was "The Guardian" :\
cool
Flyboy: I'm a nice person, I just hate to see people get kicked or banned due to having a bad grasp of the rules
I try to be informative for people
killerpony7733: well ima recheck the rules now, for safe measure
Flyboy: Please do,
yeah, killerpony7733 doesn't bite.....or atleast not that hard
gummy bites but not hard
XD
00,03No, no one is allowed to post video links, regardless of who they are.
ears
Scoot-Scootaloo: Exactly, It's what i was telling flyboy
Rules are rules there is never exceptions
/me slowpoke.jpg
omg enough with this pl0x
Internet rules usually don't have exceptions
is anyone else buffering?
linx: no
no
Is smashballed from youtube here?
nein 9
linx: nope, it's fine over here
groogle, yup
Phase4: dont forget the music :)
lol
Ded
Sweet, add me as a contact or something
l;o
00,02sergio_scriptor, saving it for a successfull flight
epic flip
TO NARNIA!
XD
Phase4: ha ok :P
Scoot-Scootaloo: What we need is a feature that makes it so that anyone new HAS to read the rules and FAQ before being allowed to go on stream and chat
that never ceases to crack me up
;o
Scoot-Scootaloo: Too many nowadays just waltz in thinking they can be and do what they want
Woooo! :O
Another masterpiece from DJ Alex S.
everypony radio?
\(^^\) |(^^)| (/^^)/
my first time on Bronystate i read the rules before entering the stream :) im a rare breed :P
ahax
i just found the source for this pony music
XD
00,03Well, since that doesn't exist, it's our job to do it.
sonicandmario85: lol ikr
hey Scoot-Scootaloo can i ask you something in PM?
ITS GOOGLE TIME!
sergio_scriptor: I can't remember but i didn't at first but quickly did not long after
00,03go for it
Well...I still do what I want, but I tend to only chat wherever I go, then I learn the rules as other people make mistakes...lol
Scoot-Scootaloo: Quite true, But still if such feature could be made or something it would reduce the amount of newcomers from getting themselfs banned or kicked
later everypony, time for lunch :$
bye for now Michael :)
Bye Michael
00,02have to search some stuff
Phase4: fine by us :)
Bye Michael :)
dat twi sounds like shes barking

ill brb i have to go water the plants
so quiet
its not quiet
just resting
shhhhh
/me zzzz
so why is Phase4 looking at arduino/pi clones?
00,02Chrysalis, dad wants one for a machine
just go with the flow
ahh
What song is this?
sergio_scriptor: i dreamt that i was falling, weird dream
Flyboy: a quite comon dream
sergio_scriptor: I never remember my dreams :/
i have dreamless nights
Phase4: put on Rainbow Factory! :)
the place where dreams and horrors come true
:P
AdamTheDuck: sometimes that happens :)
00,02Flyboy, no :<
:(
Phase4: what about September? or Discord?
i said already but,i dreamed i was a time lord named "the guradian" and i even had my own tardis,and i was fighting weeping angels :|
lol rainbow factory is still sitting in my desktop waiting to be read :S
00,02Flyboy, talking to dad
*guardian
Phase4: oh right
flyboy: living tombstone is great
linx: ikr
I only want that amazing comical rendition of Rainbow Factory with all the genderbent voices :D
MadSurge: Oh like the RDP one?
killerpony7733: I think that's the one :D
That reminds me, why is Rainbow Dash seen as gay all the time? I just don't understand the jokes :/
flyboy: how you get it so it notifys the person when you send a message
to them
MadSurge: Yeah sweetie bell in thta has the most manly voice :D
that*
AdamTheDuck: beacuse she is a tomboy,and has a rainbow colored mane
AdamTheDuck: Because rainbows are a gay pride symbol.
Rainbows are a symbol of gay pride?
AdamTheDuck: yep
AdamTheDuck: she's a jock, she's competitive and tomboyish, THEREFORE she MUST be lesbian :|
linx: Type some of their name and then tab to auto complete
Flyboy: thanks :P
linx: I'm not fly boy silly filly :D
Awkward moment when you like rainbows yourself...
i like double rainbows :P
i'm lost now
:(
MadSurge: Dat stereotype,
killerpony7733: Ikr -__-
ok im back
welcome back Noteworthy :)
linx: I was the one telling you how to type a bit of their name and then tab to auto complete to make it ping them correctly
thanks anyway :$
linx: Always there to help :)
I mean, RD is my least favorite pony, but even I can't stand the "lol she's lez" jokes!
MadSurge: Me neither :/
killerpony7733: just got lost, new here
MadSurge: to be honest i think the rainbow dash being a lesbian jokes sort of funny :)
MadSurge: I honestly favor RD due to her element, but overall i see equal in all of the mane six due to their traits and personalities
I don't find them funneh, i think she's not lez
linx: How new to be exact?
I find all sorts of things funny others don't..rd lesbian jokes included :D
sergio_scriptor: only if it's really overblown :P
killerpony7733: joined today
MadSurge: indeed :)
linx: Ah ok read rules and FAQ yet?
i kind of have the same personality of rainbow dash when it comes to flying and all that since i dream of being in the air force one day
killerpony7733: not yet will do later tho
Noteworthy: good luck with that...
yeah i know thats going to take a lot
killerpony7733: a fandom where all main characters are someone's favorite and none are seen as terrible? Surely you jest! :D
linx: Later is no excuse, Read them now rather then later. You need to know the rules :S
but im taking an aviation program at my school this year and ill have my pilots license by my senior year
killerpony7733: kk will do thanks
linx: and for your official initiation, you have to find Gondor
MadSurge: Nope, People have preferred favorites yes, But the characters themselfs are equal, Traits and everything
Noteworthy: also the air force needs special fisique,like if you are to short or to tall to fit in the chair of the cockpit,you are not alowed to be there,it's like you need the perfect fisique to do it,so good luck with the grades,just good luck,and i hope you can get it :)
As long as they're not doing something stupid like posting r34 or spoilers, just chatting is fine for now. And linx left for the moment to read the rules, String_Shredder :P
And now linx is back :P
MadSurge: Each one has a strength and weakness
linx: and for your official initiation, you have to find Gondor
yeah thanks i'll need it x)
killerpony7733: and therefore everyone has his/her favorite
00,02wat am i listening to ?
String_Shredder: i'll take you with me
even if i dont ill still have my pilots license so i can still fly
Phase4: brushie brushie ?
Phase4: Brushy brushy brushy xD
MadSurge: In the end people choose who they favor most, Though the reality is none of the mane six are better then the other
Noteworthy: cool,one of my dreams is to one day fly a autentic world war 1 bi-plane,maybe someday :P
that'd be awesome
killerpony7733: aye! It's just down to everyone's taste
HAS ANYONE TRIED CLEVERBOT.COM?
oh crap caps lock on.
eeyup
MadSurge: Yep, But i do facehoof at people who throws the old ''Bitch please this pony is better then all these''
I was saying eeyup to the conversation going on, not cleverbot
killerpony7733: of course not,everyone know that spike is best pony...Wait
HungreyForChicken: I HAVE
Spike is the 2nd best Rainbow Dash there has ever been
oh, lol
HungryForChicken: I think most people have
killerpony7733: well, I do too say "Pinkie is best pony" :D
OtakuTom: :D
No love for the background characters :'(
MadSurge: I guess you just love the hyper happy and silly pony more then the others then?
no derpy is best :D
ahah cleverbot said she wouldnt date me:( so i cussed her out and exited. then came here to brag about it ^^
AdamTheDuck: Oi i love all the background characters
00,02this is soo gona explode
oh that reminds me, i need to ask cleverbot who best pony is
AdamTheDuck: there's much love for the background ponies.
killerpony7733: and miss shrinking violet too :)
Phase4: There's no kill quite like overkill phase.
we love all backgound ponies
i asked her that
Phase4: if it explodes you ge the achivement "the russian rocket" :P
she didnt say
I was about to say that you needed to center that thing, Phase :P
all she said was your gallant or something
north korean rockets yay
i didnt even know what that means:(
HungryForChicken: It means being like a gentleman or knight,
cleverbot said he doesnt like ponies :(
twilight_sprinkle: cleverbot said that rainbow dash is best pony O_o
seriously?
WHAT IS THIS BLASPHEMY?
gasp that racist motherfu...
i asked him who is best pony and he replied "my little pony". hes gotthe right idea
This will only end in total hilarity
explosion time
lol
jigly
whos livestreaming?
Well the rest took off at least
HungryForChicken: phase4 is
:D! the other part kept goibng
HungryForChicken: phase
Phase4 is livestreaming
HungryForChicken: phase
Phase4: got the achivement "the russian rocket"
oh, has he ever made it to the moon yet?
HungryForChicken: Phase did just before earlier xD
HungryForChicken: yep :) he did it like 20 minutes ago
achievment unlocked: North Korean Space Program
and now cleverbot says pinkie pie is best pony <.<
good morning everybrony
Mornin' Sx963

At last a song with an actual instrument
hi Sx963 :)

stupid cleverbot wasted my time and made me miss something >:(
Sx963: good :)
i always listen to acousticbrony in the morning
Noteworthy: This is acousticbrony?!??
sergio_scriptor: glad to hear it :3
lol i keep asking cleverbot the same qustion. this time he said a huge message saying that fluttershy is his favorite but there is no best pony
lol yes it is :)
Why haven't i heard this song before then!
not sure
What have I been missing out on... >.<
oh man i listen to "Loyalty" every morning
soo calming
AdamTheDuck: not much just phase's explosions :D
i listen to culsparity, loyalty, ill fly higher, and long way from equestria
i love loyalty, and i like listening to join the herd

it'll make people shut up about the lack of stream
R.I.P. chat
Yea, I'm officially leaving
I didn't know you could unofficially leave
05good riddance
Is that Cs4?
05keep demanding one piece, such reckless entitlement
05and CS5
Okay, any differences atwixt the two really?
Shardikku: Yup
like....?
Shardikku: the difference is one's 4, one's 5
Shardikku: I could explain it improperly.
Shardikku: I dont wanna mix up facts
Shardikku: Best for you to google it if you really wanna know
Shardikku: But there are differences
is this what what we'er doing now?
I'll check now, I'm somewhat interested
linx: wrek is our drawer/artist here so he usually streams games/art/etc
wtf is this ;D?
how to make a gun ;D?
killerpony7733: ah okay thanks for the tips and whatcha call tham
linx: The mods/streamers?
killerpony7733: i meant info but couldnt think of the word :$
i wonder if i could draw that gun in autodesk inventor
Wrek: what you actually designing? a gun??
Eh, just open an image of a gun in photoshop and pop on a filter. DONE.
linx: If you want to see who is who and what they do usually check the ''about us tab'' and go on staff
killerpony7733: i'll do that :)
what's this about a gun?
Wrek is making weapons :O
That looks cool
or hunting rifle
Or speargun.
Hunt some seal.
It looked like the unreal tournament shock rifle to me at a point
is anyone familiar with the pimp my gun flash "game"?
Alchemist: Maybe,
its just a flash game in which there are hundreds of weapon components and you can assemble guns using them
its something you can play with if you lack paint/photoshop skills unlike Wrek :D
Im back Everypony! Turns out there's no band camp this week :(

RainBowJack: yeah thats the nuke cannon

Put the mag in the back, and it'll look like a bull pup
FlyBoy : i loved all the tanks in C&C generals from the chinese
/me is away: Stepped out.
05propaganda tower ftw
indeed Wrek
Gattling tanks FTW
im not very knowledgable in gun tech, but if the barrel is higher than the shoulder thing, wouldnt that make it have considerable vertical recoil?
twilight_sprinkle yes
unless it uses internal recoil suppression
which could kick it lower
Chrysalis: i guess we'll just assume wreks gun uses internal recoil suppression :D
Chrysalis my Mistress
Teehee guess who got a new tablet :D
MadSurge: can you give us a clue?
a) dont RP in here
Good morning, everypony! :)
b) i dont RP at all dont bother tryingf

hm, wat is dat binary
Похоже, хорошее оружие, убивают многих капиталистических свиней
/me fus ro dahs twilight_sprinkle back to Skyrim
Back to the vertical recoil question, look up the Panzerbüchse 39. It is an anti tank rifle with a barrel positioned higher than this gun here.
Thrackerzod: google translate ftw
MadSurge: :D

the swearing is not essential
the dance however is
killerpony7733: they're my favs in fact, and other people might not like them :D
I robed my dad by accident...oops.
I agree >Killerpony< :)
Shyfluttershy88: if you want to ping someone you can just type the name as you see it in chat, that will draw their attention :)
Shyfluttershy88: Show is written so well all characters should have atleast one trait or something along those lines to relate with, Oh and a easier way to respond to someone is to type a bit of their name and press tab, That auto completes it and pings
MadSurge: Ninja'd :D
MadSurge: Evil
lol
/me hides horns and trident
killerpony7733 and MadSurge: i ninja'd both of you, while you were explaining, i told her by pm :D

I am now officially TF2 premium!
I know this is a stupid question but...When are new episodes of MLP streamed?
yay :D
Crackle is best pony :D
RainBowJack: You saw Lollipop Twilight? :D
05Borg: as they air live
^That
MadSurge : when i saw the game i was like "all i can hear is TWILIGHT being Naughty"
So waht are we watching? SOme sort of... ARt or animation program it seems.
TheRandomkid321: Congratz' been one due to buying the game back in around 2007? i think or so
mlp s3 is supposed to come out this fall I think
yes
Ilchymis: Either september or later
Isnt it supposed to come out in september?
RainBowJack: My mind easily blocked that out saying "Twilight is too nerdy to be that flirty" :D
When is a new episode shown? I've always watched from youtube.
MadSurge: xD
Borg 2 AM my time.
Hey everypony
TheRandomkid321: That or later as i said, EQD wen't all stupid and believed a rumor saying august or september, But hasbro asid around september or a later month
MadSurge : agree but still its Twilight
same Borg :)
Borg: normally on movie nights or just at odd times
Borg: where do you live?
MadSurge: he lives in a Cube with all Borg
said*
MadSurge: I live in the central USA
I need to sk why did she choose taht voice for the character? She can do alot of voices but she had to make it IDENTICLE to twilights voice.
In a cube
RainBowJack: it helps that Juliet and Twilight are kinda close to Tara's natural voice :D
MadSurge I assume taht was meant for me?
MadSurge : it is Tara our Queen and ruler of our Community
TheRandomkid321: no, but it might apply to you too :D
brb :P
MadSurge yeah.
Taras the godess of 1004 voices
so...
Derpdash: Eeyup

Ilchymis thanks, I'm fine :)
killerpony7733... I ask nicely and get yelled at....
TheRandomkid321: Then people are clearly not friendly enough at times,
That guitarist reminds me of Vladimir Putin.
that guitar sound... is that Mark Knopfler?
killerpony7733 They get annoyed with me asking the same question despite the fact that I keep asking every 2 minutes not every 20 seconds... Anyway I do not wish to continue this conversation. it'll just end badly.
Watching this whilst watchin 100 greatest shut ups
TheRandomkid321: End badly?, I'm not the type of person that would get annoyed by anyone. :(
I know that song >.<
:O I KNOW THIS
MadSurge ikr ?
killerpony7733 Yu are obviously different than most the stream regulars I know of.

TheRandomkid321: As long as you don't begin to insult me or something like that i see no reason this conversation would end badly,
Whats on?
*dances*
/me has grown in a family where parents listened only to good music :D
eww country
agreed^
TheRandomkid321: Well i heard that from a few people, But again i just don't feel the need to scold or burn people unless they really make themselfs set up for it

05is so awesome :3
Now ill brb guys. I'm off to waste the leftovers I have in my steam wallet.
MadSurge my dad always listened to the same tape in the car when I was a Kid... Bad to the bones, Honky Tonk Woman, Brown Sugar and Come Together... over and over and over again so I'm just a little bit sick of this music XD
Wrek: I had to fill in the Metal myself, but my dad's got roughly your same tastes :$
my dad is like a walking Rock'n'rocll Encyclopedia... he has read so manny books about band, when I ask him abound a band he will tell me where eadh member came from :/
The most bizarre stuff he listens to are The Nice and Emerson Lake & Palmer
Don't suppose I'm the only one who listens to classical or choral in here?
/me likes old music
Ello there, what are we listening to?
Ilchymis: classical music rocks.
05enough to appreciate it but not enough to know much about it Ilchymis
Ilchymis Classic is awesome :)

AttacktheAndalite: Doubt it, May just be someone or people leaving and joining alot for some darn reason
I just wasted the last of my steam money on a Mann co supply crate key and all I got was some stupid Spy pocketwatch thingy ma boubble. Aw well. One mans trash is another mns treasure.

AttacktheAndalite What do you mean?
Shyfluttershy88: That's a OC sprite, Which is our artist's who is called wrek.
TheRandomkid321: You said you must watch stream and play TF2 till 5am and lie about what time you went to bed. Sounds like a deadline or a challenge you're attempting.
wrek's OC has been painting for weeks. maybe he'll be done soon :)
^Implying he won't
11,01I wonder if Wrek's DP is going to try and kiss the Twi DP.
05dont use that command
BronyInstrumental: twilight has been reading for weeks, no change there then.
TheRandomkid321: Ohhh
Flyboy: same book, too. she never gets bored :D
11,01Must be a long book.
BronyInstrumental: well its a book, so you can just reread it again, and again, and again, and again.
Well, Twilight lives to read, just about.

MrEvergreen: He harassed me too once, So please do what wrek says,

Getting the log now
Is this unplugged?
Wrek: The user seems to like to PM people and harass them. Nittany gave the user a warning and next time he harrased (me) which could relate to others too it was going to be a ban i think
I note I'm not alone then. :P
Lasharus: Of course you aren't silly filly :)
I meant in this situation. Still, I'll humour him.
Oh.

D:

it must be done
Wrek: Still need help clearing that mountain?
I tried Googling "that song with sweet-ass guitar", but I couldn't find this one. I really feel like I should be able to place a name on that guy.

I'd probably have thought the same.
Hey Michael and Lil_B :)!
Salve, Everlasting_Joy et FairysHuff.

Howdy Kammerjunk!
Em just a little notice. I've been having strange things going on with my heart for the past week. I have a doctors appointment on thursday. So just incase anything happens you all know whats going on. Probably nothing but best to be safe yah know.
Kammerjunk Wussat? ^_^
Oh, that's a shame. I hope it goes well.
05aye FairysHuff: best of wishes
FairysHuff I hope its nothing serious
FairysHuff: Is Latin. Sort of a greeting. Bit more formal than "heus", but meh.
Wrek Kammerjunk Thanks, it is probably nothing but yah never know.
I'll be right back.
Lil_B Thanks.
And the reason I haven't been on Bronystate much lately is that I've becoming re-obsessed with TF2 ^_^ I can't stop playing it.
i felt a bit acoustic version of aeris theme of ff7 there lol dunno why
*become
FairysHuff: i was playing mass effect 2 right now, so i didnt get a chance to say it. i hope nothing is wrong and dont worry, You WILL be fine. you are not allowed to have anything wrong with you
...I just remembered who this is. And I feel like an idiot for forgetting.
FairysHuff: do not worry, it sure is not anything
FairysHuff: i forbid you from having anything bad happen to you
Kammerjunk so... who is this :3
Bronysith It would be nice if the world worked like that ^_^ Sadly it doesn't. But thankyou
Lil_B: Mark Knopfler.
wus dis
Kammerjunk you won Tha Praice!

What happens if the Price is Wrong?
happy gilmore punches you in the face
StinkomanFan: Then Soap dies.

Lil_B: :D
THIS SHALL BE GLORIOUS
Oh, Pulse.
1994
That was a nice show. Wish I lived.
I was 12 then
At that point in time, that is.
dat epicness
1994 i was 2 yrs old lol
I was -2.
i was 1... i feel old now :(
Pink Floyd sure knows how to do a lightshow.
i was 3
I was born
I wasn't a brony in 94
They were in Denmark some years ago. It was cash.
'94? I was 5.
Pink Floyd concert? sweet
valoreins hey, we are born in the same year Oo
rly? :o yay~
Random thought, Why did they make Hostel 3 if nopony liked Hostel 2?
in 1994 i was -4 years old
So Pulse, was that the Wish You Were Here album?
What is this? may i ask
I was born in '94...
many people around 17-25 here then ^^
Groogle: Pink Floyd's Pulse concert.
Kammerjunk: no this is shine on you crazy diamond
'91 here
PsychoticDoc: Which is in the Wish You Were Here album.
Cool, thanks
Kammerjunk: but this is pulse, im looking at the tour song list right now
/me 11,01shines
Yeah, I'm just curious if they're sticking to songs from one album or just doing whatever.
'I wish I was there' fits better
Nittany_Discord is best crazy diamond
rise and shine Nittany_Discord ... rise... and smell the ashes...
11,01*crazy laugh*
Anyone wanna see what I drew?
Word of advice for all. If you eat a brownie someone gives you before a pink floyd show...you are gonna have a bad time!
I wonder if this is gonna be the entire concert, including dark side of the moon
11,01Hell, I actually have a crazy laugh.
You totally do.
Nittany_Discord: I doo too
/me is going to take a dragon nap
do*
00,03I love your laugh, Nittany! :D
Oh hi, Scoots.
11,01I wish I had a capture card. I'd stream Dead Space 2 from my 360 and cackle at the deaths in the game.
11,01They're actually pretty funny.
wat
...Yeah.
that would be funny
I played Dead Space 2 for like, 10 minutes.
That was on the PC.
that's how long my play sessions of amnesia are
Nittany_Discord: funny enough, i have a capture card but i never use it
11,01Amnesia is boring.
I like this very very slow psychadelic songs
Dead Space just wasn't as interesting to me as I'd have liked it to be.
Dat Roger Waters.
true dat Nitt
shine on you crazy diamond.....
not like... I love thm I loose myself into them
Nittany_Discord: only the beginning. It's the kind of scares that build up and immerse you
hi Nittany_Discord
Roger Waters is the only one of the band still alive, right?
Kammerjunk: yes and he just finished his wall live tour
Kammerjunk: i was at one of them too
I was at the live show in Denmark some years ago.
It was fun.
most People of Pink Floyd are dead?
almost all of them
FUN FACT: during the mixing of this song, Syd Barrett, the former frontman of Pink Floyd and the guy this song was made for walked in on the sessions and listened.
Lil_B: Pink Floyd started in 1965.
i think gilmour is still kicking
Anyone wanna see what I drew? It's clean.
not in particular
It's a sketch of my OC
Oh yeah, Gilmour isn't dead yet.
Kammerjunk oh,. I didn't know that Oo
11,01One of the most entertaining deaths in the first Dead Space was getting your head lopped off by a necromorph that then inserts itself into your neck and takes your body over.
wat
I'm getting sick of this buffering, and I know where it's coming from.
Dat Sax-Switch
PsychoticDoc: Oh. Mason isn't dead yet either.
Kammerjunk: huh, i thought he was
Yeah, me too.
Gilmour's still alive, isn't he?
Yup.
strange how the broke up, roger is still doing great with the current band of his though
this song, is how old?
very
i think we really need songs like this in today's generation
it's from 1975
Brony state needs more pink floyd, this is like the only time i have ever heaard it played here
Oh? I've seen Wrek stream it once before.
i always have to listen to my zune for pink floyd
its like barren of psychedelic music
Is this the 1994 one?
oh my god yes
PsychoticDot: haha, zune
String_Shredder: itunes sucks and its better that windows media player
than*
I use Pandora
pandoora? pffffffft
the ads are annoying, but I get over it
get adblock
>Not using an ad blocker
Hell, I use at least two.
i use adblock and have been for a long time
Michael: You can't use ad blocker with Pandora as far as I know
"<@Wrek> Platypus-Man: no youtube links durign streams" oh, ok... how can I see if a stream is going on btw, didn't see anything in the channel topic?
i dunno, never used it
How new is Pandora?
Kammerjunk: I don't know. I haven't used it in a while
this is so gay.......
Bleh, I'm just going to use Firefox anyway, because I haven't got any change.
iGoSam: GTFO
>P
Also, INB4 boot.
Hi
inb4 kick
He left.
thank god
Hey Wraithhoof
05Platypus-Man: its not shown in the channel topic. its shown on the site
hai Wraithhoof
using gay as insult... how is he?
how old is he*.
oh, ok
hater minds in a nutshell
valoreins: Probably 11 or 12
11,01The division Discord
Michael: And look how far it gets them.
>2012
>Trolling bronies
People need to be thankful for roots, not todays crap
yeah, thinking that gay is an insult
11,01Many people still hate bronies Kammerjunk.
Nittany_Discord: they usually put up a better fight though
I know, but getting mad over a troll is contradictory if one follows at least the "tolerate" thing.
i know most middle schooler does
Sticks and stones and everything.
11,01Kids are cruel.
All right, I need to take off folks. Hope to be back on sooner then later!
Valedico, Everlasting_Joy!
Nittany_Discord: you think i'm cruel? :'(
bye Everlasting_Joy
11,01BronyInstrumental: No.
11,01Lemme rephrase that.
ik i was just testing :)
11,01Some kids are cruel.
Bye, Everlasting_Joy
Silly fillies.
Middle schools, youll never find a larger hive of villany and evil
When the troll comes in, you *ignore* him.
Never feed a troll.
11,01PsychoticDoc: Agreed.
reminds me of a brony friend on fb, middle schooler and most of his classmates ridicule him because of being a brony
Aww, but I like having a troll pet.
They're so cuddly.
11,01The worst years of my life were my middle school years.
^
11,01Maximum bullying.
^
PsychoticDoc: as much as i hate to say it, you're right
CriticKitten: that's the best way to kill a troll
iGoSam: Seriously, what are you even doing?
my middle school life was full of "fuck offs" and "shut the hell ups"
I was bullied during my middle school years and my high school years.
thank god high school is gonna be the exact same :D
PsychoticDot: Sounds normal by todays standards
11,01Fun fact: I'm not a socially-confident person.
Why do you say that, PsychoticDoc
My middle school life was full of nothing, basically. Well, there were books. God, I love books.
Neither am I.
Nittany_Discord: Me neither. As in, if someone hugs me, I go blank. I have no idea what to do.
iGoSam: to come to a website based upon people to put them down seems kinda contravercial, seeing as you're the minority in that situation
hey
11,01My family hates the fact that I stay at home a lot.
AttacktheAndalite: racists, ignorants, and jackasses are all youll find in todays generations
and thank god college no one gives a flying feather about me being a brony, i even made some of my friends to watch mlp and they like it
Seriously, why is hugging so uncomfortable?
me? im just a sarcastic idiot
11,01Well, I know what to do when I get hugged.
11,01I'm just a Fluttershy.
I have no clue.
11,01Or a Twilight.
same here PsychoticDot
/me has got a hard infancy
then i wanna hug you nitt D:
Nittany_Discord: You could move out. :)
hi
Kammerjunk: i never get hugged enough to find it "uncomfrtable"
also re :)
11,01red_ony: I have no job.
Because of my learning problems, I spent most of my school days in Special Education. Most of my classmates were classified as EC (Emotional Conflict). In short, pretty much all of my classmates in high school were bullies.
hai FlutterShyblackops1
:[
I stay at home all the time, the only time I go out is to go to school
PsychoticDoc: That's not my problem. My problem is that it's a social action.
Nittany_Discord: Oh...than maybe that first and then move. :)
11,01I would have stayed in PA if I had money.
The rules said that there were supposed to be two teachers in the Special Ed room at all times. Oftentimes, there was only one. And other times, I'd be alone with those guys.
Kammerjunk im not social, i am anti social, in total i have 4 friends and they have been my friends for years
Hey guys, I'm back! :$
ohai MadSurge
Hi, MadSurge.
MadSurge: join the retelling of highschool pain
hai MadSurge
11,01Hey MaidSurge.
i feel kinda bad sometimes, cuz i wanna work and have tried to get a job in the past, but puffed up business managers wouldn't employ me for 'legal' reasons
hai MadSurge
MadSurge: Resaluta. We're talking about how middle school life totally sucked.
BronyInstrumental: What reasons might that be?
BronyInstrumental: that sucks, im not even old enough to get the job i want
11,01I'm glad there's a campaign against bullying nowadays.
red_ony: child labour :(
BronyInstrumental: Oh :)
strange thing is i'm anti social throughout high school, but suddenly because ponies i learn to talk to people about it until now
Kammerjunk: you mean junior high?
11,01When I was growing up, it was the victim's job to deal with it.
MadSurge: I have no idea. You people have weird education systems.
Nittany_Discord: you think it's changed?
Nittany_Discord: the campaigns do nothing to help, its not bullies, its intelligence of people today, i have never met a bully
I hope you're not thinking of that thing that Michael Savage is doing.
Kammerjunk: the one after elementary school?
MadSurge: I don
PsychoticDoc: you lucky son of a *****
ive only met idiots who dont understand the times to talk and be happy or the times to insult and be an ass
BronyInstrumental: wasnt finished
sorry :)
Nittany_Discord: Tell me about it, My principal actually accused me of being the bully at one point due to racism,
MadSurge: I don't know! D: Over here, you go to one school for 10 years, then you're free to do whatever you want. Preferably go to another school for 3 years.
11,01Well, I see campaigns to stop bullying instead of telling victims how to deal with it.
Alright. Cool.
11,01And all that led to was kids killing themselves and others because they were so sick of being bullied.
Nittany_Discord: it just made it happen more, it seems to me. only it goes even further un-noticed
I like to think that idiots of my gen have made me even less social than i normally am
the only you can do sometimes is resist
11,01BronyInstrumental: Anti-bullying campaigns are worsening the problem?
because teachers don't care for u
Nittany_Discord: more than you'd expect
to be honest, im clinicly depressed and havve a lot of problems controlling the way i react to people
Michael: precisely. teachers give no shits
Nittany_Discord: my bullies were mild jerks that grew out of it during high school. After that it was a "fuck you, fuck you too :D" friendship
Irrelevant, What are we watching?
PsychoticDoc: I don't. That's how I deal with it.
PsychoticDoc: React, that is.
Metronome: pink floyd
ok
Pink Floyd <3
Kammerjunk: Its my learned nature to be a sarcastic prick, than usually continue what im doing
11,01BronyInstrumental: I guess punish the bullies?
11,01That was my solution.
^
^^
Nittany_Discord: that option's blurred out for me too. teachers give no shits, and i'm a pacifist
I think a lot of trouble with anti-bullying campaigns is that political correctism can badly skew the definition of bullying.
Nittany_Discord: Did you carve a little face into the wall next to their bed every night until the entire wall was covered in little faces?
Nittany_Discord: Punish them? makes them even more volitile, makes them blame you from the issues and make more bullies go after you
Or at least put them in the bullied's shoes to make them desist
11,01Kammerjunk: No.
Oh.
11,01MadSurge: Not a bad idea.
This calls for waffles.
i would make some ham sandwiches but this concert is cool
11,01Let them go through the pain of having zero friends and constant social rejection.
Ah, see, I just socked my bullies and they left me alone. And the school didn't have the balls to punish me very hard because my parents were quick to point out that it was their failure to deal with their bullying problems that led to this.
Nittany_Discord: how you that work, how can you make them even start to feel that
One of 'em was a big enough kid that my fist didn't even hurt after drilling him in the stomach, either. You bet he never messed with me again, or anyone else for that matter. :3
why are we even talking about this?
Because this is BronyState.
chat derped. refreshing. brb
We just talk.
because bronies are nerds..:/
All i can say is, im a sarcastic prick, everybody my age is an asshat, and i got 1 hung from not family my entire life, and i havent seen that person in more than3 months
CriticKitten: a giant chicken, then?
/me kicks Kammerjunk into a bottomless pit, to finish fulfillment of the reference.
hug*
goddammit
:3
Nittany_Discord: I pretty much had most of the zero friends and constant social rejection, I more or less played games to escape it all as a kid
Kittyfaec. :3
One time in High School, some kids on my bus stole my backpack and while they had it, they took some of my stuff out. It was later found stashed over a doorframe and some of my stuff was gone. I asked the school to try and find it and they literally told me that they're not allowed to "legislate morality".
me too
11,01killerpony7733: Same.
^True
Meh. In my school, we could sit indoors in the breaks. So I just sat. And I read.
God, I love books.
killerpony7733: i know that feel, just replace games with internet
wow. you guys had a lot of different ways to deal with the problems
MadSurge: Most bullies are. The only ones who aren't are usually part of gangs, and those kids can't really be dealt with.
11,01Of course, I became a bitter person for a few years.
00,10man you are all depresing this morning
11,01Where I hated everyone.
Oh hi, Sumica.
11,01Sorry Sumica :<
i dealt with it using music
:D Sumica
hai Sumica
killerpony7733: Same, but now I has ponies aswell!
Sumica: Am not! I'm encouraging people to beat the shit out of their bullies. D:
11,01I'll stop.
hai Sumica :)
00,10you dont have to stop nitt
music, internet,games, and sarcasim are my releases of stress and anger
i have an entire folder of songs i just sorta.....wrote as they came to me. maybe i'll release them one day, idfk
interesting discussion is good
yesh
00,10just you know just point out the things you all know
pink floyd helps all my, if not most peoples, problems
BronyInstrumental: I have a bunch of short stories I wrote because I was bored organised into genre, length and the alphabet, in that order.
music helps me relax
Hi everypo- ooh wrek and awesome music! :O
hai MegaMoonShine
Kammerjunk: I have that kind of order only with collectable cards :D
Oh yeah, I still have a bunch of Magic cards.
wrek's pink floyd concert?
I have never used them.
I can't honestly say I hated everyone. I guess video games and TV was my escape from all of my pressures. Then that whole murder simulator controversy started brewing. And it was so widespread back then, that I felt like everyone who I didn't know for sure was against censoring games for violence must've been for it.
screw it imma make some ham sandwices
Laz0rs!
lasurs
Kandarihu: People get upset for the strangest things. Like when you slapped that ass in Duke Nukem: Forever.
dem lazors
pew pew
Kammerjunk: I just have these Kid Icarus Uprising cards, it's more like interactive stickers :D
Kandarihu: please, video games for a while made it worse for me becasue before my parents divorced my dad yelled at me for being lazy with games
Destroy them with lazers!
Pewpewpewwubwubwubwubwub
PsychoticDoc, sorry. Didn't mean to strike a nerve.
Michael: Yup. Pink Floyd knows how to do a light show. Looked great when I was at a concert they had.
and then an epileptic fit
get your wubs out of this chat
This is a chat for REAL music.
It's clearly a sore spot with a lot of people around here.
I know, I know
I find it funny that video games are blamed for violence when sports aren't, at least not nearly to the same extent, I mean, I have yet to see video games cause city-wide riots :P
we want the classic pig from waters!
11,01Sumica: I just don't want to depress others by complaining. I'll remind myself of my grandmother's friends that did nothing but complain and put me into depression.
But there's a song titled destroy them with lazers :$
Hrafn, that applies to the current controversy, time wasting, too.
anypony here playing the open beta of phantasy star online 2?
11,01Point the lasers at the crowd!
Which has wubs :P
what is this
time spent having fun is never wasted time :3
11,01It's so awesome...and now I can't see!
"Look at these kids, wasting their time away getting zero social interaction or exercise with their video games"
those laz0rz
Hrafn: if kids were influenced by video games then in the 70's all people would have done is roll around and eat ghosts and fruit
>Online games
epic lazors
Dude...
Well...I don't thing games should be cut if they're sold to adults...but otherwise..
BronyInstrumental: lol :P
lol at BronyInstrumental 's comment
Nittany_Discord: my grandma was a grumpy loner lady, but it seems my birth helped her being a little more softer :)
what is this
"Alright! I got my beer and my chips, and I'm ready to spend a solid 4 hours (or however long) watching a Football game"!
BronyInstrumental: I want to see that.
11,01My grandmother has borderline personality disorder. Look it up.
11,01And be glad you're not living with someone with BPD.
One of my grandmothers was literally insane by the time i was old enough to understand
Nittany_Discord: who? (sorry to hear that)
Nittany_Discord the Brony version of that is Pinkamena Syndrome
I worked in a psychiatry instead of doing military duty...borderliners were the most annoying patiens I had...(no offence)
11,01Two people in my family have BPD.
I have aspurgurs
11,01It makes them self-centric brats.
11,01Worse off, they don't even know they have it.
Apparently it's unhealthy for teenagers to be spending hour upon hour of their free time grinding in an MMO, but it's totally healthy to sit around for hours and hours on end watching a bunch of people bounce a ball across a court or carry a handegg over a field of astroturf
Kandarihu: well, it deosnt screw with your eyes
red_ony you were in the military?
Nittany_Discord: bpd?
^ seems legit
noo instead of military duty
05you guys enjoyign the show? :3
11,01Borderline Personality Disorder.
11,01Wrek: Yes.
Wrek: yep
yesh
Wrek: og course !
Kinda
Wrek: I love it! :O
Wrek: hell ja
*of
Nittany_Discord: what does that do?
Wrek: well i'm not that keen on this kind iof music but i LURV lasers
yes Wrek But I dont know who it is playing
11,01And it's not Pinkamena disorder.
sorry
11,01That's more bipolar.
ya you are right
GarrettBrony: Back then military service was compulsury if you didn't chose to work for a social institution for the same time..I chose a psychiatry
you know, i may be have a bipolar syndrome
man, these ham sadwiches just made this conversation a lot less depressing
GarrettBrony: pink floyd
Kandarihu I will never understand how people can argue that Sitting in front of the PC all day is unhealthy without ever bringing up the people who do even less by sitting infront of the TV all day
o/
11,01Gaming actually works your brain.
Lil_B: Well both isn't going to do you any good...
Nittany_Discord: some games don't
Anyway, I was kind in the middle of watching Macross II (feeling like trolling my mom with it, maybe I'm not sure anymore). I'm kind of wanting to get back to it.
Nittany_Discord unless its farmville
Nittany_Discord: Yep, It's the reason i got good reflexes
farmville makes you a farmer!
11,01Even CoD works you out.
yes FPS does have benefits
of course, sitting still all day is unhealthy, but doing just about anything on a computer is far more mentally stimulating than watching tv
11,01You develop a skill from dealing with 12-year-olds.
red_ony yes, but it still baffles me that sitting in front of the TV all day is somehom more socially acceptable...
11,01:p
11,01I kid.
yeah. if kids were influenced by video games 90% of facebook users would be farmers by now :)
11,01You do develop reflexes and whatnot.
COD helps with making your hands clentch in rage, build a better grip
Lil_B: Für Hartz4ler vll :P
hell, spending too much time online is what taught me English :P
the mind derps in mysterious ways
BronyInstrumental: or a mafia
Hrafn: TV is wht taught me english
I dont sit in front of the TV anymore. Since I dont have the Hub Bronystate and the Interent have replaces Tv for me fully
11,01You die too fast in CoD to develop strategy when attacked.
You develop cognitave functions relivant to the game genre you're playing. I wish the Brain Training genre wasn't so short-lived, though
twilight_sprinkle: same with me, actually, at least at first, but then I started spending more time on the computer than watching tv
Hrafn me too (and 80% of all other germans I know who are good at understanding english)
i haven't watched TV in years
soooooo... who in here is marked?
getting outsite and joing an engish course would probably have taught you faster :D
Cod is probably the worst military game in existance, if you want army, play arma or arma 2
Nittany_Discord: Yep, If you ever played tribes ascend you will learn alot of weight/momentum/speed related skills on how enviroment works etc
or BF3
Dark_Horst marked?
killerpony7733 same with portal
but if you want teamplay go TF2
Lil_B: marked http://www.motifake.com/image/demotivational-poster/1106/the-mark-gamer-demotivational-posters-1306969931.jpg
Tribes Ascend is hard, though.
11,01Valve games are good for teamplay.
Kandarihu: Hard yes, Fun once you begin to get the hang of it? YES
you guys convinced me
red_ony: actually, English classes are mandatory here from grade 4 and up, but I still learned more from the tv and internet than I ever did at school :P
11,01You cannot lone wolf TF2 or L4D2 unless you are very skilled.
I'm going to get my ass outsite now
11,01And/or lucky.
Hrafn same here
*s
-d
If you're interested in rewiring your brain, just play a game that you're not good at, and NEVER PUT IT DOWN until you're good at it.
Dark_Horst: Oh god i have that too
for me, the most entertaining team based game that is also a sim and a fps is Amra 2 Co\O
CO
Dark_Horst: Though mine is on my left arm not right
unless you are spy :D
11,01I bought Arma 2 for Day Z.
but spies are easy to kill
Dark_Horst its strange... IÄ, sitting on my PC from mornign to dawn for the last 3 weeks now and I don't have that mark...
Problem is, I'm having more problems with the shooting and the quick aiming in Tribes Ascend. I'm finding it easier to get used to skiing than actually shooting.
killerpony7733: just tiny traces of it for me. even though i game a lot. i wonder if that is a sign that my mouse sensitivity is too high. i barely move my hand
11,01Spy is hard to play in TF2.
Nittany_Discord: thats the only reason its famous, i bought it a year before Dayz
but is so fun
Kandarihu: try playing skyrim with reversed controls
Hey, all. What goes on?
hi Shutterfly
sex
Shutterfly Pink Floyd concert
hai Shutterfly
11,01Spies are annoying to die to as well.
11,01Damn backstabs.
Meh, Pink Floyd...
specially with dead ringer
Kandarihu: I learned both to a point, It's always a risk when predicting where this person will go etc
Well...I'll be afk for a while now ...GOING OUTSIDE :P
/me backstabs Nittany_Discord
11,01In any game.
not really
pffft outside is for no lifers
outside? that place still exists?
see you to see movies at the latest
Nittany_Discord yah Spies just love to pull a Julius Caeser on the other players
Kandarihu: I'm good at correcting MIRV mortar shots
I'm using a Wacom Tablet with the mouse accessory. It works just like a mouse, except the tablet decides what's up instead of the mouse.
Nittany_Discord: they are HELL in arma (or dayz)
PsychoticDoc: I thought this place was? :P *ducks*
MIRV launcher is one of the few weapons I can somewhat reliably score kills with.
GarrettBrony: That's all they're good at
i love demoman now :D
et tu Spy
red_ony: nah, my life is pretty much internet required, so real life is for poeple with out a life
Michael I think Demoman might be a brony
11,01Unless there are bots.
11,01Bots are easy to hit.
hehe
GarrettBrony: lol
PsychoticDoc: :)
Dear Celestia, I think I'm having deja vu AGAIN
and pyros are a pain of ***
Nittany_Discord But I love Bots. They are so good at making Snark comments at bad movies
11,01Lol GarrettBrony
pyros arent that bad Michael
My favorite class is probably the Engineer
i hate pyros
Michael I think the Pyro might also be a brony
pyros are jerks
Kandarihu: Though to be fair juggs are easy ish to play as when dealing in tight and enclosed areas,
brony or no brony
WOOHOO DRawfriends
GarrettBrony: yeah, but all the damn day spychecking
Of course Pyro is a brony, you saw what he sees, right?
red_ony I would like to go outside more... there is nothing interesting -.- no people to talk to and no courses or Clps that are interesting for me :/ maybe I will have more luck when I move into a bigger city and start go into a Universaty :/
11,01That guy is eating the mic.
11,01::p
lol
LOL
Kandarihu: Though predicting where the mortar shots go is a bit finicky, Else juggs are really fun
lawl
11,01My family won't stop bugging my about going outside.
nomnomnom mic
Nittany_Discord om nomnomnom
WOOWOOWOOWOOOOO!
/me noms the mic
oh my... dat mic must be tasty ice pop or something.
when my mom tells me to go outside, i just say, " and what play in the street?"
11,01It's good every one in a while, but I don't like going out because I'm not social, so I don't have anything to do.
Nittany_Discord: I know the feel, Family constantly says going outside fixes everything, It's funny they don't realise i have almost no friends to go out with and everything
11,01My mom is very social, so she doesn't understand my point of view.
same as me
11,01killerpony7733: Yeah.
Nittany_Discord, same as me
my mum never tells me to go outside, we live in tha hood :D
My gf has made me go outside alot more than I usually do. Its not bad but the sun is horrible where I live -__-
i dont like going out, but since i met brony friends in my place i gather with them on some occasion... :)
eww, sunlight :P
i live in louisiana, its too humid to go outside
i only go outside for buy something or go to one cinema
11,01I did some things with my brony friends at Penn State. That was it.
my reaction to sunlight is very much like that of a vampire
It's amazing how the internet brings together people who have no social skills.
11,01I kow.
inoright
11,01*know
Yeah, it's great
OO OO OO ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL
i live in bristol, the antisocial hub of racism and discrimination in england
dat song
Ughhhh this song is just played too damn much on the radios
is epic
we are actually socializing right now right?
pfft
I only hang with friends every blue moon. Two of them live about an hour and a half away from school and the one that lives 10 minutes from me is antisocial
valoreins: good call
this song is too awesome to be listend to much
Back to Macross with me. I might get kicked off this computer any time. So if I log on with the "Buddy Bear" Nick extension, that's me. And this nick is my mom.
I moved... so i dont have many local friends :'(
I have good lighting in my room thanks to 2 big windows... but always with the curtains closed so I can see the screen more clearly :P
Er, Macross II. Not Macross
brb, guys. walking le dog
Wrek: can we watch The Wall after this or later?
Lil_B: I also have my windows covered most of the time, plus I coated them with tinted film, the kind you put on car windows to make them dark :3
Hrafn: what did you coat it with?
Hrafn: just some spray thing?
nah, it's more like a plastic film that you put on the glass
Hrafn: where did you get it?
hardware store
Hrafn thats extreme Oo (well, I don't really have curtains, I have a Jalosie (or however you spell that) which is always just a tiny crack open XD
Hrafn: cool, i need some of that, by room is too bright in the mornings
they might have it somewhere that sells car accessories
Hrafn: k
my head faces the direction the sun rises from, and i have a window near the head of my bed, and my blinds are crappy
funny would be to use that foil from the glasses they use for Sun-Eclipses. You have no light, but you know where the sun is :3
I have my curtains over my window overlapping each other so it's darker in the morning
lol
one of my windows is half circular and it has no curtains which is annoying
aww

Nittany_Discord: a trip in the ocean is fine, I just don't like dicking around the beach :D
i feel sorry for any epileptics in the audience
I don't like beaches that much, the sand gets kinda annoying after a while :P
There's no beach where I live.
i like beaches as long as they have lots of rocks to climb on
Lil_B: well, now I do my bycicle sessions to be less chubby :D
Spanish Inquisition.

One of these days I'm gonna cut you into pieces!
MadSurge I'm going swimming every weekend for an hour to not loose all of my muscle-mass (which ain't much)
Lil_B: I just don't like swimming in the ocean, it's too murky
I hate the beach. Sand is coarse and gets everywhere..
/me wishes learn to surf
Lil_B: I should start going back swimming too, it's the only "sport" I'm good at :D
The beach is like 2-3 hours from where I stay.

AJTheMightyGamer: okay, so the elevation wont be as bad as it was for me. I live in PA so it was difficult getting used to the elevation/oxygen. But if this hasn't been shoved down your throat enough, have at least 2 Nalgene types of bottles filled each day.
