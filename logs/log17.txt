:O
declawing sounds barbaric
I'd maybe have a cat I owned neutered, but not declawed
my kitty's previous owner declawed him
it'd be like chopping off your finger ends
ikr!!
but now his paws are all squishy and weird and cute
Whoever edited/made that script must be trippin something
They think of declawing differently in Europe than they do in Amuricah
yeah I saw that idk if it's real or fake
if my nails get long enough its like i have claws... very easy to scracth ppl
Lol.
Fake for a number of reasons.
they have barely any structure to them, they're just like fuzzy blobs attached to arms
:o
I was just looking back into her posts now but she always said she hated her dad blah blah blah
You wouldn't scratch me though right VampirePrincess? :o
cat can i has another vid?
declawing is forbidden in the EU unless it's essential for the health of the animal
rawr cultures :3
<3
And don't scratch Emmi either :O
it's completely outlawed in the UK
Cat: So is capital punishment
yes
You peeps don't like to have any fun over there
You enjoy cruelty?
srsly
no
if thats an at at walker doing the caramelldansen
cat more music plz?
1. She wouldn't apologize for making a double post if it was to say her dad died. 2. People don't actually pause four times when they write, like when she goes "he's... he's... he's... gone." xD
:(
I am going to commit harry karry
/me hugs Cat
03what's that
I was being kinda sarcastic :3 .... I'm the most liberal person in Alabama
she might to be dramatic sounding like a movie, all kids do that
/me doesn't like declawing or capital punishment
its a cockney slang for hara kiri I think which is suicide in japanese
I think
I just live here Cat :3
Don't blame me D:
idk I'm not gonna make any accusations quite yet I'll just watch it unfold I guess
No one cares about being dramatic if they actually lose someone.
/me didn't start the fire, it was always burning since the world's been turning
good point...
They only do that when they want attention.
/me pets Cat more
The first thing you do isn't go an post it on the internet anyway.
OHSI MY FAMILY JUST DIED!
06It's a rather special kind of suicide :x
and*
13^
my other cat had a bad reaction to the declawing surgery, his paws got all puffy and swollen
heya AE
but that was not my decision >.>
Haha, true, but we don't know how long it's been since she got the news, either.

I might give her the benefit of the doubt if she wasn't prone to "creative license" with the truth.
http://youtu.be/BbyMjigrxGE
:) ty cat
back
Dare me to respond with something like "OH NOEZ"
*?
oh no no no no no I wouldn't do that
let's just see what else happens first
Alright.
I mean honestly even if she is lying about it we're mods and we should be polite about it until further on if we know for sure if she's lying or not
No no no no no yes?
:4
I don't want us to get into trouble and if it is true that'd be really rude of us
Have you guys got an IRC?
There's no way to know if it's really true, and she has obviously been lying to use for a long time.
I've never needed one, so no.
Boo. *rotten vegetables*
dari what do you mean like a whole channel??
:)
Yeah, a channel.
Bring traffic to the network.
nope
I still had the idea for #jailbait, though.
LOL
:)
Haha, why do you want traffic? I can only imagine.
\o/
Because it's so hard to find a bus around here.
Quack.
XDDD
ya know what? cat has yet to find something tht he likes but i dont.

Tell me about it. It's highway robbery when do find one, too.

*when you do
/me noms Emmi
Stand and deliver all your change.
Why, hello there.
what does she taste of?
hnmmm
/me noms Emmi more and ponders
Even the pennies? Most robbers just find them a nuisance.
That's a good idea.
Only carry around pennies, they'll just leave you alone.
That's what I do.
....... cherries :3
When the bullies grabbed me and shook me upside down it'd take like ten minutes for them to empty my pockets and collect them all.
Lol.

yeah it's like how people that watch glee think that if they join their school's glee club they're automatically fabulous superstars or w/e
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JphZtpafdKY
...Glee...Eugh...
Don't even get me started on Glee.
That show is a meat grinder for songs.
indeed
I love how their director or whatever got all mad and threw a hissy fit when the foo fighters declined
I'd be embarassed on their behalf if I was involved in any of the dramatic arts.
Right? That was so funny.
I think I know what band I want to put on next
:D
this one is taking a while to load...
Hey, want to cause some disruptions on epic-chat?
That's what she said.
...
Look what I started with and you'll know.
gah, I had to link the shortened radio version of the song :/
typical
?
Shortened version, very typical.
its still loading.
That's all we ever get is the shortened version.
Can't we ever get something with LENGTH?
Good save.
LOL
I linked a thirteen-minute long song earlier D:
Damn, that's a long one.
it was awesome too
longest song I have is 39 minutes I think
Yeah, but I've had better.
:)
He was okay.
if it doesn't load, have this song instead http://youtu.be/F4lViga2wgs
I wouldn't want to make anyone self-conscious...
yay that one worked.
But at least comparable to the average dagger.

no Internet at home
12nope
now ammeg is saying that she's happy he's dead
12not going to happen
oh ok
srsly her father isn't that bad it's not like he raped her or something
Oh, I have to see this.
hey I found Umby
jk
She actually alluded to that.
But it's just another exciting piece of the drama plot she's making.
IM AMMEG MY DAD CALLS ME PRETTY IT'S REALLY CREEPY
NO FATHER EVER CALLS THEIR DAUGHTER PRETTY UNLESS THEY WANT TO GET UNDER THE DRESS
Lol, I hope the inspiration for her username wasn't just her name. "ME? AM MEG! AMMEG".
nah it
it's backwards of Gemma which is a character in the books
http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6492741/crazy-chinese-kid-street-performers
that is crazy
Oh.

Hahaha, Dari, I thought the same thing before I realized it was from the book series.

I am not leaving yet.

I was about to say "You know what's really crazy? I could've SWORN you were from my forum."
LOL!
I bet he would have banned you. XD
You know what's really crazy? I could've SWORN you were from my forum.
oh
I was in that exact spot
He won't ban me. :P

Why not?
but i want to go to their big electronics market
XDDDD
I hear they have sweet stuff, including pre-release stuff
Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
LMAO
my dad and i might go.
It's a quaint little place called Spyro Forum.
hahaha
that's so mean/funny at the same time
Leafeon: your nick is familiar..
The Internet is not a place to look for sympathy. You wouldn't go into a city you've never been to and just tell strangers that you lost your father.
/me nods
Me either.
You see a lot of that kind of stuff on street corners
That's what he said.
"Mpre money for me"
that's terrible
the typo and what she's saying
"IM SO SORRY hes in a good place now oh well then thats good maybe ur free from him but hes gone awww that sucks but it does not"
If he's as bad as she claims, you'd think they'd say he's probably not in a good place.
What, "I'm so happy for you, well at least now he will have to endure horrible torture in the fiery pits of hell for eternity"? :P
you need to be aggressive if you are a street preformer.
That's pretty much the answer she was asking for, if you read the post.
Lol.
HE CHEATED ON MY MOM HE'S THE EQUIVALENT TO HITLER AND DESERVED TO DIE
Besides, I don't believe in lying to people just to make them feel better.
BECAUSE PEOPLE HARDLY EVER CHEAT ON EACHOTHER
Yeah, but they're really agressive about it ... it's a cultural thing
Why not just cremate him and eat him with milk? :)
They're very blunt about things in their culture
Mmm, tasty.
yeah I noticed that
they are actually the same way even when they come live in another country
02~desu
Yeah, like the people in front of Chinese restaurants in the mall who "ask" if you want a sample.

yet another retard from PS
7Hack me a male Macargo with Heat Wave. :P
7('cause that would actually allow me some use)
Male + Heat = wow
4i can only hack shinyness and pokemonness
7Darn.
4not moves
4sowwy
lol
7Eh, then give me a normal Seedot.
4oh, and levelness
4i had a battle vs a stranger
4i won!!!
7If you have a D/P/HG/SS, then get a Shiftry, teach it Defog, then transfer it.
7Make sure it's male. o3o
4i don't have 4th gen
7Ah.
4besides
7Because I'd like Defog for competitive play. :P
4defog is a hm, can't be transfered
7It can.
7If you send a pokemon from D/P to HG/SS then to B/W.
7Complicated, but works.
4???
4i dun get it
4explain please
7Defog is only a HM in D/P.
7It's replaced by Whirlpool in HG/SS.
7Thus, you can transfer pokemon with Defog from HG/SS to B/W.
4so, googolated
7Y'can't get me a Defog Shiftry, I'll guess. :P
04I just saw Toy Story 3...
04Dang....
yay or nay?
04also wait
04(yay, VERY yay)
XD
04(but :c @ the sad parts)
??????????????????????/
4i'm sowwy, i'm a BAD PERSON!!! D'X
same
04Quan really?
7Nyeh?
04So no whirlpool in HGSS or Defog in DPPt, but vice-versa is okay?
04Cool I guess o.o
04Even though Defog is useless xD
7Pah, it clears away Stealth Rock. :P
7(And Shiftry on a Sun team, which I'm hoping to build. >>)
7But yeah, actually getting a Shiftry with Defog is going to be D:
04Why?
7 1: get a Seedot on D/P. 2, evolve it and teach it Defog. 3. Send it to HG/SS. 4. Transfer it to B/W. 5. Breed for optimal stats.

Did you know DR. Evil loved Death Rays?
XD
02I should, but I'm to lazy
Forklifts
Awesome

Cheap forklifts :3
wat

!fight Kyu
/me uses ExtremeSpeed on Kyu! It's a critical hit! Kyu loses 250 HP! Kyu has 1386 HP left!
Oh yeah that reminds me
Kyu
07o3o
Do you happen to know any statistics?
For pokemon attacks
As in
07uh
How do they calculate how much damage something does?
07somewhat
Based on attack/defense/move power/crits, etc.
I'm going to code it into the !fight script or make a new one :x
07there's a calculator for that, but I don't know the actual values off the top of my head
Ah
:P
.-.
Bananas.
/me rolllll
;o
Hello!
:P
they're fine for me :P
they're not for me
>bugs
Nothing's ever perfect
a couple of scripts have security issues
need to fix them before someone figures out how to exploit it
07ah
07found the formula
07Damage = ((((2 * Level / 5 + 2) * AttackStat * AttackPower / DefenseStat) / 50) + 2) * STAB * Weakness/Resistance * RandomNumber / 100
loladventuretime
07and the random number is between 85-100
Kyu: Define ranges, otherwise the variable means nothing. :P
07well
07that all depends on the pokemon o.o
Oh god not that show
that show is rubbish
/me used to watch 1000 Ways to Die
x.x
I still do watch it
Also, is the division always integer division? :P
or just Wikipedia what deaths ive missed
07yup
07they're all pokemon stats, so it's just all rounded at the end lol
/me goes to sleep
Let us APL that statement, becuase I am bored. :P
Aww Night Ray
/me huggles Ray goodnight :3
02Night Silver~
Sleep well :3
/me hugs back
X3
02Thanks :3
:3
02Same for you~
^_^
02now poof
02Kthxbai~
:o
04mew...
thanks Kyu
04my wrist still hurts ;-;
RandomNumber is what?
Ah
okay
That's reasonably easy to code
04Also fun fact: computers aren't really suppose to be random
07also there's stat changes too, but that's easy
04Am I correct?
yeah stat changes are easy
STAB is how much again?
and weakness/resistance?
071.5
Ah
072
072, 4, 1/2, and 1/4
Oh right
yeah that's easy
07if you're gonna stick in all the typings
yeah I will
04wait
it's not too hard
07how about swords dance/growl/etc?
yeah will be doing those as well
How much do each of them increase the attack stats again?
or lower
07k
042 is super, 4 is double super, 1/2 is not very effective, and 1/4 is really not effective, right?
07so in order
04k
07starting from -6 levels to +6
Yeah
0725%, 29, 33, 40, 50, 66, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400
Ah
/me RUNS
oh god
lmao
Thanks Kyu
I don't think there's anything else I need to do
besides abilities...oh crap, abilities
04if there is
04bulba
04and lol
am I even bothered enough to do those?
I need to get a list of 5th gen moves
I have all the ones from 1-4
07the stat changes happen after the main calculation
04How will you assign everyone an ability?
Ah
Sp, for the fun... here's that formula in APL:
DAM ← ⌊((16? + 84) × WEAKRES × STAB × 2 + ((⌊(POW ÷ DEF)) × ATK × 2 + 2 × ⌊(LVL ÷ 5)) ÷ 50) ÷ 100
04Let alone nature?
(APL: Operator precedence is right-to-left evaluation, no precedence.)
nature
screw nature
04:c
well
if you REALLY want nature
I can do it
04well for coding sake
04I guess it's negligable
07nature and statuses are harder lol
04Are you going to be doing leveling up?
04OH LOL
04This would be epic
statuses would be a bit hard
I will be doing levelling
04Everyone's level is their idlerpg level
04XD
...lmao
04You and Kyu dominate
oh crap
04Everyone else gets OHKO'd
idlerpg died again
oh wait
the computer go killed
04:<
will be up tomorrow
04k
I'll move it to somewhere more stable
04k
04I got hit by a car and lived :D
anyway what do you mean by after the main calculation, Kyu?
04D:
04yep
04ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
do you just multiply the final calculation by the percentage or something? @ Kyu
>:
/me hugs back :3
/me squeaks and rolls on the ground
04Kiss it to make it better? *SHOT*
04nah
lmao
heh
04|3
ooh
hai Quilava
at least I'm using readini and not variables
04hm
hi
04Types
Types
04Who will be what type
what types are there again? lmao
04:V
oh wait I should have them somewhere
04Dark, steel, fire, water, grass, fighting, normal, ice, electric, psychic...
then again I have 50 billion files and stuff
well
04Dragon and bug...
I plan to have everyone start out as normal
07lol why'd you underline normal
derp
04Type changing? XD
yeah
04because it SUCKS
you can do !settype
04k
04Dual types? :3333333
yeah
04<3
!settype 1 Dragon 2 Dark
:D
04Hydreigon
/me shot
no u
04yes
07you should set type and set moves o3o
04because
04i love it
04|D
yeah
I'm setting moves
07:D
044 moves each?
I guess
04or less gay?
unless you want to change that?
04yeah
know every move you've learnt
lolwhat
07that sounds so insanely complicated |D
04well hm
I can do it XD
04that could get you overpowered
I have the base code for it from my !fight script
Just needs to be copied and pasted
Night Everybody :D
and edited like crap
07I wanted to do something similar with my battle script but I got bored :3C
I get easily bored
04How about you do a calculator for who can know what?
I'm not sure really
04Based on type and set characteristics in a list
dunno what exactly to do with moves
04like claws/rakes, leafs, roots, stuff like that
well
04That way if we "find TMS" (I feel like we're making an IRC RPG)
LOL
04We can only learn what works for us
IRC RPG
oh dear
I could probably make this work like IdleRPG
04Be like Pokémon X
Final Insanity 3
04Every time you find an item
/me dies
when you level up you find an item
oh god
I have to do items to
:x
04"*NAME* found *ITEM*"
too*
04*do do do~*
anyway
do you just multiply the final calculation by the percentage or something? @ Kyu
for stat changes
07yeah
04bulbapedia exists for a reason
04|D
Ah
04No key items
well then
that's easy
04or rare candies
rare candies lol
04we don't want drug addicts
/me runs
I might not do items yet
04fiar enough :3
because that's a bit difficult
04This convo is fun
natures maybe
04brb on iPot
depends on how easy the calculations are
Haha
iPot
04;P
So fitting
lmao
iToilet
Don'g get too high
iCrap
04doesn't work
"Your own personal toilet from Apple!"
yay RJ is going on IRC shortly :3
04iPot and Macintrash

lmao
LOLOLOL
iPotty in my Macintrash?
lmaaaaaao
XD
04eww
04|D
04now BRB
we suddenly changed
04stop being fun ;2;

anyway
04lo siento
let's start coding this
04está mi problema
04k
I would love to have an iPotty so i can get my sister a gift for her birthday

/me compiles a plaintext list of 5th gen moves
EWWW 5th Gen
SS, better than 6th gen
-w-
I still haven't figured out what to do about moves
It's GSC
o_o theres a 6th gen
duh?
No
LOL
When it comes out
I need to make a move system
when 6th gen comes out
HGSS will be better than it
Lol
the world will bow to its fail
or the other way round
who's RJ
K?
well, 6th Gen is gonna be rubbish
5th gen is bad enough lol
GameFreak should just go independanr
:|
...all that makes me think of is rocket jumping
Independant
pokemon should make a pokemon RPG
Owait
:P
where you actually play as a pokemon and such
Waait
not like PMD
Oh
Yeah
ah
Oh
but an action RPG
Okay
I don't think I know them
like Oblivion
That would be cool
now that'd be awesome
Ew
Tha'd be stupid
pokemon RPG <- I can imagine SEGA making this
And boss fights
PMD or nothing
/me shot
yeah it'd be freaking awesome
Hopefully like Sonic Chronicles
Remixes of the legendary pokemon music
:{
I wanted to make one
Vs Ho-Oh in high quality
but I'm not that good
and I don't know how to make games lol
Oh god Sonic Chronicles had some of the most rubbish music ever
Let's make it ourselves
except battle 4 that was amazing
if I could steal WoW's engine then maybe
OH GOD
CHRONICLES
NO
;.;
Kill it
GAMEBOY QUALITY MUSIC GTFO
YES
My ears
gameboy music was good
RSE's music was nice
game good
But on a DS music
Songs except intro bad
Um
No I mean
:P
GBA quality on a DS
no
GB quality -.-
It sounded crappy
ah
anyway
Sonic 3 remix was EWW
LET'S GET TO SCRIPTING
actually
finding 5th gen moves first
They shoulda hired Snappleman
/me runs
hm
I'm not doing abilities
no natures either
unless you still want them
but they'll have no effect on stats

o3o huh?
What the F***?!
And yes I did
It's awesome
Shes on :3
Ugh my wrist hurts waaay too much ;-;
awesome
found a list
I love you gedit <3
so useful for getting rid of crap
NS, RJ is on IRC
k
ohai drf

Hi drf :3
for anyone who wants it
http://pastebin.com/jeNDA300
there's a list of 5th gen only moves
LOL
ED
now
I need to figure out what each move does lol
actually
why don't I just leave out 5th gen moves
I'm lazy
Lol
effort >:
Most of them are evil anyway
Incinerate and acrobatics
Can screw you over
o-o?
Incinerate burns your held berry
ouch
Acrobatics has double damadge with no held item
.________________.
Wait not double
Probably 4x
ouch
O.o
o
Wow
now that'd hurt
Seeing how drf got pwned all the time xD
By dinochicken
Weavile. That thief ability thing. Acrobatics.
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
Fuuuuuuuuu ;<
Yep :V
anyway
anyone
want to help me with this script?
no
;p
damnit VNC
stop screwing up
lmao
why is it that in every single script I have
I have about 50+ brackets?
I dunno?
serious
XD
in the swearkick script
I have like
30
the fight script has over 100
about 150
wtf
I'd help
But I can't
;-;
I think I mostly need data
because the scripting shouldn't be that hard
considering I have the base code
lolcowtipping
Cow tipping is fun XD

Darwin Award Nominee.
ouch
the section about a transmitter acting like a microwave oven is PARTIALLY true
RF has been documented to cause heating in living tissues but microwave ovens concentrate the radiation into a tighter space for a greater heating effect
http://failblog.org/2011/05/05/epic-fail-photos-engrish-funny-honest-and-cheap/
radio and TV transmission antennas only concentrate energy into the horizontal plane resulting in a radiation pattern much like a doughnut
wider coverage but more difficult reception very close to the tower in many cases
Does anyone recall me mentioning a Monkey girl?
just my two cents about the RF issue
o_o
no...?
I know that
just explaining it in a simpler way using something that people are familiar with
03XD
03hm
03Cherry Dr. Pepper doesn't taste much different than the normal kind
why do you have to amsg everything :|
X-chat does /amsg on every single window
not just the network
it's annoying
...amsg is always annoying
amsg?
yeah amsg is annoying
prints that crap on every channel on the network (on mIRC)
:3
lmao Sneas
ooh
Oh
Kyu, do you know the chances of a move missing?
or well the formula
holy crap I need to learn to chew
07uh
o.o
o.o
o.o
someday I'm gonna choke.... more than usual

TIBERIUM
IRIDIUM
;o
and how long sleep lasts...
the sleep thing I could probably get away with setting the number of !fights as $rand(1,5) or something
07sleep is random between 0 and 6, but weighted towards 2-4, I think
Ah
and $rand does not like being weighted lol
07and hitting is just move accuracy x evasion
07er
07well
03yay
03LL and I earned the Love Shirt avatar item for getting an achievement
evasion :x
07(accuracy x accuracy level) x (evasion)
03we totally need to wear the..nvm
lmao
03it's for Portal 2
03hug 3 people and youg et an achievement called Friends List With Benefits (I'm dead serious)
07er
07ffs
lolwut?
03o.o
07no wonder moves can miss with 100% accuracy o3o
o_O
03EW THAT FACE
lmao
o_O
o3o
07apparently a 100% accurate move is actually 99.6% accurate lol
wat
o_O
really?
03god dang it you guys
03I went to type "ew that face" in Xbox live when it asked me to type in my email
03>_<
lmaaaaaaaaaaao
ahahahaha
why say ew that face in teh first place anyways drf
03because it's incredibly annoying
03that's all
07well then stop being a dork
07o3o
o3o
03that's just who I am
o3o
03I'm not gonna stop being me
/me hides
03wait what
03oh.
03domain xD
!todo list
04ToDo item 1: 03mods, learn how to use this script!
04ToDo item 2: 03Get Umbreon and Kyu to takes pics!
04ToDo item 3: 03update !fight script to do types and actually have effect moves do effects and also add OHKOs
07we've gone over this with other things lol
woah when did those get added
oh yeah
lmao
yes
07lol o3o
You still need to email me D:
I'm lazy
requires me to go through my email for the pics
and then click forward
and wait for it to send
and then type "HEY I SENT IT"

...lmao
LOL
03also :O one more view
LOL
03also it's 12:34 right now
haha
but yeah, Kyu, what's the evasion of a pokemon or whatnot?
07evasion is nothing unless raised
ah
but wait
wouldn't (accuracy x accuracy level) x (evasion) = 0 then?
07well
07100%
Ah
07so (accuracy x accuracy level) x (1 - evasion%)
Ah
you mean 1 x evasion%?
07no
hm
the evasion% is the same as any other stat changes amirite?
07nope lol
._.
071 evasion level gives 25% chance to evade
07so 1 - .25 - 75% chance of a 100% accurate move to hit
be back in ~30 minutes
picking up my bro
Ah
OH
I get it
thanks
07in any case, here
07http://www.legendarypokemon.net/battlemech
ah
07there's the ratios for evasion and accuracy
well, thanks for your help
07I'd explain things better, but I cbb cuz I just got on summer break =P
lmao nice
hm
do you have any suggestions for what base stats to start out with?
everyone starts on level 1
07level 5
start on level 5?
07yeah
Ah
base stats 8 or something?
Allo!
damnit
I'll be back in 30 minutes
12!Kyu
/me 7does a barrel roll! ._.      |:      .-.      :|      ._.

na na na na na na na na na na BATCHMAN
/me flops
I'M OUT OF SHAPE
hm
07arf and stuff
so then Kyu, why start on level 5? o.o
ohai
derp
back
07because that's where starters start :D
lmao
07also what eggs used to
12kyu DX
/me puts you on his head
07eep
12i miss the old days
07?
12when you were more active
Ah
07o3o
well
I guess
What base stats then?
07bases should be a random number between 15-25
07stat increases per level from 1-4
07just because there's no way to do EVs and IVs lol
well EVs and IVs would be retarded lol because there'd be no point
Probably could do it but it'd be extremely difficult
and the calculations would end up like my flying banana equations
equations with massive amounts of brackets*
and hm, that sounds reasonable
12start what at level 5?
07well you can't have EVs without every battler having real base stats
True
And Umbreon, coding a sort of "battle simulator" script thing
07same with IVs lol
12oh
well EVs I definitely can't do
IVs possibly
as they're kinda set/random
07and I don't think there is a IV/base stat/nature calculation that I can find
Is there even one? Or is it just random?
I'm not doing natures for now
Too difficult to calculate
IVs probably not either, although that makes hidden power retardedly useless
07there's some calculation between IVs, natures, base stats, and a random number that makes a pokemon have what stats it has
Ah
well if I (or you) can find that calculation I'll add it
hm
(2*BST+5+IV+(EV/4))*nature effect
And HP:
(2*BST+10+100+IV+(EV/4)
but that's level 100
oh wait
((2*BST + IV + EV/4) * L/100 + 5) * N
07so you'd give everyone a random IV for each stat at level 5
07and have that calculate their starting stats
Yeah
07although I'd make base stat totals all be 100 so everyone's even aside from IVs
07and that would mean you don't have to deal with EVs
Hm
EVs I doubt I can do
...and then I need to figure out HP stuff lol
I mean
hidden power
I have the calculation for hit points
(2*BST + IV + EV/4) * L/100 + L + 10
ah maths, wonderful
;o
07I'd just say screw Hidden Power and Secret Power
07since people are picking their moves anyways o3o
07Hidden Power is weak anyways, and Secret Power needs field changes o3o;
yeah
field changes oh god
but well
07and then there's weather o3o
I dunno how to make the base stats total to 100 :x
07I'd skip that too lol
...weather.
07uh
/me dies
07base stats don't total 100
IVs?
07I meant 100 per base stat
Ah
07so it would total 600, like Mew/etc
oh right
Yeah
that'd be fairer
07weather is a simple multiplier for rain and sun
well, I could do weather, but yeah, those 2 would be dodgy
07not to mention Poison
as readini bawwwws at searches
07Toxic
07Spikes
07TOXIC SPIKES
toxic spikes, spikes etc. I'm removing
xD
lmao
07XD
stealth rock too
those sort of moves can go die in a fire
I was trying to recall what Australia's national anthem is and the nation's external shortwave service threw me for a curve
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
lolwut?
I kept thinking it was Waltzing Matilda but no, not quite
heya Drake
12o-O
04ohai
derp
I know that now
yeah derp
not ignorant though
and yeah, Kyu?
07the battle would just be !fight (whoever) and it outputs one line just like it is now right
Probably
I could give you the databases and stuff for your !battle script
07so anyone could battle anyone at any time
interesting thing is it did not become official until 1984
07I dun need it =P
And yeah, they could
spam could be a problem though :x
07so if there's nothing that keeps it one-on-one
I might make a script like !startbattle nick etc. so it's one-on-one
07pretty much everything turn based can be take nout
12hmm
and they can't spam crap
well true
the Star Spangled Banner became the US national anthem by an act of president Franklin D Roosevelt in 1931
might make a few versions of the script
however it was written in 1812
to overcome crappy problems
well
I'll probably remove status stuff like poison, burn, etc.
because the system would be weird
Sleep I might put in because it'd be funny
for people to activate the script then go "DAMN" when they figure out they're asleep
Hm
do you have a calculation for EXP, Kyu?
._.
07well
07a normal pokemon needs around a million exp to get to 100
07so I'd toss that out the window and make your own =P
...oh dear
wow
a fast levelling pokemon still requires 800,000 EXP for level 100
:x
07I say start with 2 wins gives 1 level at the start, and add 1 more win needed every 2 levels
07so lv5 needs 2 wins, lv7 needs 3, 9 needs 4, etc
Ah
07it's not gonna be spammed so much that anyone gets to 100 fast regardless
Yeah true
but lol
/timer 1000 0 /msg # !fight
xD
07and you have to be lucky to beat someone lol
heh
07either lucky or spammy =P
>healing moves
07also
hm?
07maybe you should have a timer that keeps them from attacking the same person more than once in say, 30 seconds or so
That's fairly easy to do
it's the same as the rest of my floodkill systems
03*WB02(Lyon02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
set %scriptfloodkill. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] on | timerscriptfloodkillstuff unset %scriptfloodkill. [ $+ [ $nick ] ]
uh
I mean
set -u10 %floodkill. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] on
removes it after 10 seconds
wow, I never realized there were a number of Australians here
derp
and wb Drake
1/2+
04thanks
04no idea what happened there
its interesting how international the channels I show up on are
well the more active ones
but yeah, Kyu, I'll put it around once per 5-10 seconds or something
inb3: polish on #T-T
thats right
lmao
well today was significant
a baseball game and another year of life passing
I can't believe that its been 23 years
now I need to figure out where to start my script

shut up
uh Kyu
<&Kyu> so (accuracy x accuracy level) x (1 - evasion%)
accuracy of the move...and what's accuracy level?
07the percentage that reduces someone's accuracy stat
07like sand-attack
Ah
07so flamethrower would be 95%, x accuracy level
07and accuracy has the same numbers as evasion
oh right
so flamethrower would be (0.95 x 0.75) x (1 - 0)
or something

its actually good to go back to those old games and be able to beat them when you couldn't as a kid
and I finally got my hands on a NES :)
nice
well in the post I mean
I cant believe I'm actually playing on old games over my 360 >.>
Good
You should
OLD 16/8bit > xbox360
Since they don't overhead and fail a
but xbox live has just driven me to playing them and the DS again, I'm sick of paying a lot of money for a game geared mainly for multiplayer and everyone on live is a racist, 12 year old kid
as often, or at all :P\
Exactly :P
Having a friend be next to you using a controller hooked to the same system > Online
06Don't forget the adults acting like racist 12 year olds because they can!

FM can't go above 15,000 Hz due to the pilot tone
AM can
I at least knew that AM had better quality than FM
not many do
but why is FM preferred for most radio stations?
bad reputation
receiver manufacturers skimp on AM in bad ways
AM is capable of better frequency response than FM and also stereo

night all
ghriugd
so what are you guys gonna do for mothers day
no idea
D:
D:
we'll both still be at school
oh :C
I'll probably just give my mom a call and by her something before I go home on Tuesday
I'm gonna go have fish and go to the zoo, and hope that I don't lose my tempers to mothers with double strollers.
XD
what's wrong with double strollers?
:P
hell last time I was at the zoo some child got abandoned and was walking back and forth outside the food area in a sea of people going MOMMY??? MOMMY??? or did I already tell you guys about that
it's like OKAY IF YOU DON'T TEACH YOUR CHILDREN TO FOLLOW YOU THEN PAY ATTENTION YOURSELF
I don't think you've told us that
and double strollers suck when they're trying to fit them into the fish place which is barely even wide enough to fit that into when you have three other mothers with their children with you outside and of course YOU HAVE TO SHOVE THAT THING IN AND NOT LEAVE IT WITH THEM OH NO
blarg
I should really be going to bed
NO
I have a final tomorrow morning :(
DON'T ABANDON ME LIKE A LOST SMALL CHILD
oh

I have one tomorrow too
But it's not until 2
college life sucks
or is it 4?
not till 2 something :P
ends at 4

/me idles
7o.O
03yeah that sucks

12It means I can't go out as much as I'd like so I am looking at something that'll pay much more
02brb
03my parents want me to get a job this summer but I don't want to have to worry about classes AND a job...
12x_x
7Hmm...
12Don't do what I've done (try to do everything at once)
03Yeah
12I'm rather stressed because of it

03yay firefox tabs?
12you know I'm gonna play Portal2 in a bit, STILL not finished it.. too busy all the damn time
Well, DRF can finally be a supercenter
03XD
03LL and I beat it
03well
7Ah.
Or..at least WORK in one :P
03I beat single player on my own
03then we did co-op
7Have fun when you get the chance, Arti.
03I had actually beaten co-op with someone from HoSHiNET like right when it came out
03but that's on Steam, and EW STEAM
Don't forget to watch out for the spoilers :P
03you know, it's actually a lot easier to get the Professor Portal achievement on Xbox than it is on Steam
They are everywhere
03for the simple reason that you can make a new account and it will work - but on Steam, that new account would have to also own the game, you can't just pop in the disc and play
03:P
7Yep about the spoilers
12Thanks Quan, I was trying to earn extra money by designing websites for people
03OH

That's because back then Bethseda had a good engine
imagine if Morrowind had Oblivion's engine

that and it depends what you're trying to mod

02Manly, Hi~
Hey. Again. For the second time today. lol
I need a 3D artist who doesn't mind: A.) Doing low-poly models for games; B.) Wants to be a part of game development; C.) Doesn't mind being a part of /freeware/ game development.
13wb Ecco, and hai Manly :3
02LOL
That's a REALLY late hai, AE. Haha!
13Better late than never? |D
I suppose. lol
Basically, what I don't want is anyone who thinks of modelling as work; it MUST be something you enjoy doing. If you don't have fun doing what you do then :p
SNEAS
03ih
hai
sup
03I swear whenever one espeon appears the other is soon to follow
-sigh-
34 people here
Nice
13Nice indeed ;3
;S
Problem officer?
Energy Blue theme for XP is <3
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
hai Drake
04morning
Ohai Drake
time zones
dammit
Hey, lol.
04hi Manly, and HML
04Hey Manly, I found someone to play MH Tri with :D
Awesome. xD
Have you guys been tagging every monster?
06Heya Drake :3
04Well we only got to hunt a Jhen last night
04Hey Espeon
04But we're gonna do more today
03DRAKE
High ranker? lol
04He's rank 110
04so yes XD
03*awesomeface*
Nice. And your HR? xD
13ohai Lyon :3 /late
03I was gonna say something but you left too early
03if we're lucky maybe I can get some of my friends to come join us :D
03Not today though, they're busy
Oh, I see who it is now. lmfao
04ohsweet
04XD
04I just got to HR 27 last night
04so
04today we're gonna kill Jhen.
048D
xD
Shiny and I killed one yesterday after a month of not playing.
It went... pretty well.
04awesome lol
04I finally got a Mohran Brace from rewards as well.
04Hopefully I can get some more today
They'll start falling into your pocket in no time.
06Uh okay, completely random disconnect
I don't really like the Jhen since it takes up so much time to kill, but it's so fun fighting it.
03Sometimes
03the problem isn't the rare stuff like gems and plates etc
03but it's getting all the other crap needed .-.
Like? lol
04Not for me.
Everyone has different luck on Tri. Some people have it raining Gems, but nothing else.
Oh, yeah. I was there to hear you complain. XD
03To be honest though once you hit HR 100+
03You barely need anything and just focus on helping your friends :3
04Yes
04ONCE
04ONCE YOU DO
03WELL DO IT THEN
03DO IT NAO
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
04Until then I'll beat the creators for making Plate's have 3% drop rates
I started helping as soon as I hit online, cause I already had completed all of the armor sets offline.
Except for when I hit the high ranking hunts.
/me headshots due to his ears bleeding from the MH talk .x.
Drake; guesswhat
03It's funny to taunt my friends who have terrible luck getting gems and plates
04what?
03"Hm, I need a bit more money"
04XD
03"Time to sell some SPARE GEMS"
03"<trollface>"
04Lucky bugger
03Monster Hunter Logic:
03When you want something - you never get it
03When you don't want something - you get it
So true.
03Usually why I get plates and stuff
03I focus on helping BUDDEHS
06Isn't that item drop logic all the time in every game ever?
03Well only if you play games like WoW
03but yeah pretty much
I became Patriarch of the Temple and Arch-Master of House Redoran 8D
06If something has a chance under 100% to drop, it will always take you more tries than it should to get it.
Doing Fighter's Guild and Thieves Guild
and by god
06Kinda like 95% accurate moves miss more than the 5% makes you think :3
what the fuck did Bethseda do to get high
and then create Oblivion
There is no way in hell this could be the same company
that created Fallout 3 and Oblivion
13;;
04ikr?
03Or games seriously just troll you
Which is why you don't need to take them seriously.
03it says 95% chance to hit and it's actually programmed to have 5% chance to hit
03That would be hilariously cruel
06Sometimes it feels like 60% accuracy or something
06and it seems like moves like hypnosis has 90% accuracy for NPC's too. But anyway, it does make things exciting~
04o-o
04congrats on kicking Morrowind ass
04but I haven't played Oblivion so I woudn't know
Rayyyy. Dang, he promised me a brawl today.
13Dark Void is such a broken move
03BRAWL?
13Darkrai's Bad Dreams ability + nightmare + Dream Eater doesn't help either
03DID SOMEBODY SAY BRAWL?
03=DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
03Sorry that game makes me excited
13when put together, it ends up being complete BS
7o.o
13the least they could do is lower Dark Void's accuracy :/
7Hint, AE: Have a pokemon with Vital Spirit or Insomnia. :P
7Or Sleep Talk. :P
13Because having 80% accuracy and putting BOTH Pokemon to sleep in a double battle is just stupid >.> /rant
7And Drake?
04aye?
7What are the levels of your main pokemon team?
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
13At least I now know that Darkrai is, in fact, a pure dark-type and actually has weaknesses |D
13I used to think it was ghost-dark until recently
I need a brawl. XD
03Go kill that basement dweller of a pokemon
7Lol, AE.
13So Darkrai's actually reallly easy to take down, IF you get the chance to hit it
13>.>
03Manly I'll brawl you if you give me like
0320 minutes max
03need to do a handful of things first
Sweet.
04uh
04one moment
I haven't played online in forever, and I'm dying trying to get a match. Everyone else is too busy today, it seems.
13I'm not busy~
7I'm open for Pokemon, Manly. :P
13But I'm also not motivated~
02I'm open for brawling
lmfao
04Quan: Toxicroak is 85, Braviary is 80, Gardevoir is 77, Milotic is 84, Hydreigon is 83, and Chandelure is 80
7Ah.
7Hmm, not bad;
04I cbb to train anymore.
Which Pokemon game, Quan? I don't have B/W yet...
04I never play online.
7You know, I want to test out my six-Hydreigon team. :P
02But warning: my internetz is Failing, like a boss.
7And you can only have multiples of a pokemon in open battles or Infrared.
7And open doesn't neutralize levels.
7So, yeah.
03I am
03ALWAYS
03free to brawl
04Well I can't play online because of my hidden internet
7And Manly: White. D:
13How do you guys train up your Pokemon so quickly, seriously? D:
02LOL craig
02xD
7Audinos help.
02^
13I've been casually training up my HG team for the past year now, and are only just reaching lv 80
12I have a slight problem, I am stuck in Soul Silver AND Black in both the exact same places.. the route to the league.. -v- I am just unmotivated to train them up for it.....
7I can trade you pokemon to help you get through? :P
12It's been nearly a year with Soul silver now I think
13I know what you mean about training feeling like a pain in HG/SS
12Hmm, well Nick traded me a lucky egg to help wth training in SS but I still haven't done anything with it so not sure if that'll help ^^
Lol, Craig. I don't come on this chat often, so I wouldn't know, haha.
hey Manly
13I just dedicated a lot of time and effort into training right outside that house where someone heals your Pokemon |D
oh whoa my nick
7Late, Drake, but okay.
Hey. xD
12XD
13Black/White shouldn't be too bad though, since you've got a Lucky Egg to help o3o
7Audinos give LOADS of Exp.
13Also, for people who have fought Kyurem, I have a question
03Right brb
03and when I get back
13how do you get to Kyurem?
03Brawl teim
7You know that forest, right?
02AE:
7Well, there's like this tiny lake in the center of it.
7Get to it, and Kyurem freezes the area.
13I got to the forest area in Giant Chasm but couldn't work out where to go to get to the stairs on the right
02Through a pineapple, under the sea. [/jk]
13Oh, really?
13Maybe that didn't happen because it happened to already be Winter in-game while I was there |D
13Thanks :P
02But PROTIP:
7Then you can get to Kyurem's chamber.
13Nope o.o Just rain
02you have to do a "Loop run" (or something like that) over that forest in a specific way. because if you don't the tiny lake wont appear.
13I'd sound like such a shut-in if I said I hardly ever look outside the windows when I'm at home |D
12I only looked out when I noticed on Facebook that someone near my house was reporting storms LOL!
13xD I personally find it to be a nice change from the bright sunny weather we've been getting recently
13I've been wanting some "cool-down" days for a while now :3
13and despite the clouds and rain it's still fairly warm outside, so I'm perfectly fine with it~
12Yeh it's nice and humid so I'm ok with it XD
/me has returned~

03heueueueueueue
o.o
WB weirdo :3
03Thank you
Drake; bullshit I have
i'm only on the "visit said tribe and learn what you can from them" quest in the main quest
I just spent so much time on side quests, and the factions
04lololol
that I forgot about the main quest
and being a badass
04Good plan though
I got 19 K
04Get stronger
04...
Veloth's Judgement
04I have like, 490K
Full Redoran Armor
04From summon-abusing
(I have the entire thing so I'll be richer than uz :P )
and various artifacts in two places
one is my manor
Indray inbetween Ald'Ruhn
and Maar Gan
Second is in Pelegiad
Also
should I join the Legion Drake?
I mean I have the Lord's Mail
and pratically am the best warrior
i got 100 long blade
04I dunno
and 85 in Blunt
04Lord's mail doesn't even look cool
It doesn't
04so I gave it to that dude, then I killed him to become captain
but Ebony's Mail and Tribunals armor along with Redoran..
Dear fucking god
04And I got that awesome sword.
BRbs, dinner time
Yay me
04Magic is AWESOME
But I don't want to join Imperial Cult
i fucking hate them
04Don't join them then
But
themoneh
andthequests
andtheexperience
04I don't think you need to join the cult to join the Legion
04lol
I know I don't
I join the Legion via Gnisis
04The cult has you gathering money from commoners and collecting items around cities.
I know
04It's not worth it
thats why I hate them
because they do it for the money
the Temple has more justice then them
and its the Temple
the one that supresses dissdent priests who are partly right
and partly wrong
Though I also ask
should I be a vampire?
I mean I know i get Spell-Breaker as a item
and get to kill moar demons for Lord Molag Bal
but it just seems tedious
find a specific member
join the clan
do their shit
and then do some quests in Red Mountain
the most unholy place in Vvardenfell
AndI found M'iaq
teh liar
04._.
04no
04don't become a vampire
04It's not really worth it
04Besides, once you get to a certain part of the main quest it becomes impossible to become a vampire
I know
the Corpus section
I kinda figured that out when you're suppose to go to Tel Fyr
due to House Redoran
and your the Nerevarine
why are to to befall on such simple diseases?
But I gotta tell you
alot of the artifacts you find
like Vampire Ring
Veloth Judgement etc
are worth getting for two reasons
one they're powerful
two you can sell them to this lady in Tribunal
which gets you some 30k for each item
that and i know if I become a vampire
bad-days for me
i'd do it only for the quests
04Hmm
04I don't know
04I never became a Vampire
04Wait, do you have Azura's Star?
Not yet
I didn't visit her shrine
but I know itys in the south east part of Vvardenfell
04You really should
near Molag Mar and some ruins
04even if you don't have a good skill in enchanting, it's worth it.
because its Azura's star
and she saves our asses so many times to count
04XD
/me misread Azura as Azure. :3 </:3>
but yeah
I could just use console code
and just become a vampire that way
do the quests
and then do the quest for vamprism cure
06This is not surprising
/me fires rainbow-coloured bullets at Xelispeon
13:B
/me eats them
13Hax

Yeah
probabilities shouldn't be too hard
just $r(1,8)
1~3 is twice, 4~6 is 3 times, etc
12o-o
oh true
that's fine then
trying to think of the point of an "effect" field in the database
as in
how would it help the script?
03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/chatroulette-trolling-narnia.jpg
you mean like status effect?
yeah
eh
those don't really seem like they'd be too useful
I could probably remove the effect field
since this isn't ACTUALLY turn based..
things like paralysis would just mean you have to spam fight more
I'm removing most status effects
and sleep. and freeze.
ok
lol, freeze
the only ones I would consider keeping would be sleep, freeze and paralysis
seriously?
but dunno
wadda fuck
I'd definitely not keep poison/burn etc.
how would they work in the script?

Persona, Fursona...what do you call a dragon then?
wb Drake
03*WB02(Lyon02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
well
you dont like purple do you.
with paralysis
when they attack someone it'd do a quick calculation
and if it generates a certain result the attack either goes ahead or they're stopped because of the status effect
..won't that just encourage more spamming of the script?
you won't go anywhere
probably
well, I'll get rid of that then

honestly I was seeing it the other way around
where you keep burn/poison and such
Hm
perhaps
but I'd only make them go for a few times
where it takes a chunk of HP every time you attack
otherwise it'd kill them off very quickly
as I think it takes off 1/8 HP each time or something?
dunno, what do you think?
not that much
it was either 1/8 or 1/16
http://oi56.tinypic.com/nwf1c5.jpg
better version
probably 1/16 :|
then again
you can always just leave statuses out completely
it'll save you from having to write in a bunch of moves too
I might keep them in
just to make it more interesting
can't be that hard to code either way
just more time required
tedious, not hard
yeah
then we have toxic
and burns, which would halve attack as well
because you'll also have to add in probability of effect.
well, I'd just add in an extra field saying the effect, and the script can do its $rand thing
and if it hits that number then it's game
but what about the difference between shockwave and body slam :|
and the effect comes into play
well, if shock wave's prob is 1/10
I put the number as 10
I thought shockwave was always stun
and then do $rand(1,$readini(battlemovedb.txt,shockwave,probability))
or something
shockwave was always hit
oh.
zap cannon always paralyses
I meant, always stun vs chance to stun
if it's always stun then you can either put the number as 1
so it's $rand(1,1) or simply state another field
..grah, never mind <.>; you put it in anyway
xD sorry .-.;
bleurgh, anyway.

would it be better to have some pro restore this video by giving them the original VHS, or my recording in digital? < either source, depenz on how it has aged.
anyway, i doubt a commercial service could do signifigantly better than we can cuz > crap in, crap out, and they'll just run it through whatever crap tools they've got
well, i'm off anyways, bye

03Lowry digital
/me hides
i've found out, theres avisynth filters that can do almost everything that you want
03there are plenty of places that do it, just usually for big hollywood movies as it's fricking expensive
03orly now
yes.
03as it needs more than just denoising
03there's tracking lines on the screen, colors are faded, etc
what i think would be appropriate.experimental is
03also what about audio? That's your field :P
*motion-compensated grain addition, *stabilization, *S,B, YUV, *denoising, *sharpening possibly (but there's no detail to sharpen)
because VHS are what, 240p?
03not realy, they're analog
03so they have no resolution
03they're 480 "scan lines" but yes it would be roughtly 240 I think
03wgat's S, B?
03*what
saturation, brightness
03hm
since VHS is analogue, you can capture it at any resolution, including 1080p. but that would not be sensible, because there's not much detail at that resolution.
03I recorded it at 480i, as >DVD
k, mb 360p then?
03deinterlacing it with what?
anything that works
video is not a picture, you need to have the content & try stuff to see if it works.
03well I can never figure out how to deinterlace stuff that was natively analog
03since it's not like it really has a native digital form
03IVTC for example would be stupid in this case
audio "is my field" since i have been wrong about video in the past, and people can critisize me for it. audio, noone can because noone knows about ot that much & has the tools to critisize me if i'm wrong.
03well you did a good job on the Eagle ceremony
03but I don't suppose you want to try to fix up my parents' wedding :P
I could, but will I?
03that's why I said "want to"
well, except Hale on rizon, he's pretty good, he's more of the theoretical dude, he sometimes say stuff that i don't get
i'm more of a practical dude cuz i use the tools
so i would suggest.experimental: *exciting/EQ, *noise reduction, *stereolization
03eh
&mb SRC
03all I know how to do is normalize, LOL
03in this case, it's *faded*
03like
&mb un DRC
03the parts where there's a band playing music
sound is "muffly"
03it sounds like an old rec ord
03*record
03yeah, that.
03I wouldn't know how to fix that
03it's not like the Boy Scout thing where it was just quiet and staticy
03the volume is fine, it's just faded
i guess. you can fix it so that it sounds like a LQ mp3
03using what?
a exciter, possibly.
03wtf is an exciter
it generates new frequencies based on existing frequencies.
03hm
LQ i mean 64-96kps stereo
03well, what would a VHS have normally? Prolly not much better
experimental i mean, to go beyond by what is "safe" and acceptable/usually done.
its analog, but about 48-64?
03I woulda thought more like 128kbps but whatever
>crap in, crap out
03because I mean, I've had music videos on VHS, they aren't that bad
03but yeah I know

caused massive netsplits
and suspect a DDoS on flame as well
13Espeon gets the best ability IMO
+I
13and it's my fave, so xD
7Primary reason I chose that. :P
06I can't even remember what the others get
7Hopefully, it's female. >>
Xeligon?
XD
7Leafeon gets Chlorophyll, I remember.
06Lol female Eeveelutions
06They are
7Hey, they can pass down Dream abilities. :3
06something you need some luck to get x.x
13You can't SR for suitable nature/gender and such when it's a dream world Pokemon, right? :<
06( Or in other cases, patience~ )
7Nature, you can.
7Gender, nope.
13Are you able to save in the entralink?
13I thought you couldn't o3o
7You can't.
13But in that case, I want to SR for a good nature/characteristic~
13Lol this guy on DW
13we've been watering each other's gardens for a while now and he still hasn't accepted my dream pal request :B

Now what
Doesn't...make sense
/me watches HML get hit by the failtruck
03LOL what
O.o
Also, huge URL is huge
7Hmm, DRF?
7You know Pokesav?
:D
i am using synergy right now
03yes
03why?
7Do you use it? ._.
03I have before, yes
7Do you take requests?
03LOL
03I guess
7First of all, can Pokesav randomly generate natures and IVs?
7(If you're wondering, I've just been to Smogon's IRC. O.o)
03well
03I'm not really sure
7Hrm.
http://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/04/30/a-computer-that-knows-when-to-say-thats-what-she-said/ < DRF's PC
7Well, I'd prefer whatever pokemon is created to be as legitimate as possible except for not being obtainable. :P
7Ah, well.
03I've never had luck making Pokémon from scratch
7Mmm'kay.
7I suppose it's partially me between munchkining and having to decide... morally? (is that the word?) on competitive play.
03munchkining?
7Optimizing stats in a video game.
7Like getting max IVs, EV training, yada yada.
06Well, that's competitive for you.
7Indeed.
7But I must if I have to win. :P
Win against who :P
7Whoever I'm facing up against.
This is why online multi sucks
Thank you for being a good person ;D
7Ah, not online.
7Real life. :P
7Where you can't just quit and be happy.
06I don't care about people "munchkining" myself, as long as they don't become elitist and look down on those not trying as hard as them :P
03inb4 wondertomb
Wait, what, when..how did pokemon stats become IRL?
03I was just thinking
/me mindbombs
7Lol, HML.
7Real life pokemon competitions. :U
03originally I thought you could just use Toxic or whatnot against one of those
03but what if you teach it moves that heal it
Oh, those :P
03I think there's a move that gets rid of conditions?
7Eh, Toxic still reaches 16/16.
7Heal Bell?
03porolly
03and what do you mean 16/16
7Toxic does 1/16 damage + 1/16x (where x = turns poisoned) per turn.
7So after 15 turns, toxic will do 16/16 damage.
7Percentagewise.
03that's why you use something like Heal Bell.
7Yep.
7Until PP runs out.
03and then teach it like, Synthesis
03so it can restore HP too
03and there's really no way (assuming items aren't allowed) to beat it
7Does Miracle Eye work?
7On a Wondertomb?
03what;'s that
7It's a move that makes Dark types not immune to psychic attacks.
7But ah, wait, that's not super-effective, is it?
03indeed
7Hmm...
7You could Trick on a Toxic Orb. :P
03what's that
7A hold item that induces toxic on your pokemon.
7Helpful for pokemon with Poison Heal.
03LOL
7It's like Black Sludge, in a way.
03I don't know any of these moves
How does that even..work
03are they 5th gens?
7No, actually.
7 4th gen items.
03Miracle Eye isn't?
7Miracle Eye is 4th gen as well.
03weird, I've never heard of it
7It's relatively rare.
03but hmm
7Oh, wait; can you Soak a Wondertomb?
03psychic usually dcan't hit dark? o_O
03what's Soak
7It changes your opponent's typing to Water.
03hmm
03you might be able to
03but assuming you're playing against a random stranger, what's the chances they'd have that?
7True.
7I missed it when Fire Fang could hit through Wonder Guard.
03o.o
03what
7There was a glitch in D/P where the move Fire Fang bypassed Wonder Guard.
03the only Pokémon that can legitly have Wonder Guard is Shedinja though, right?
03which would mean fire is super effective = that makes sense to me
7Yep.
Hey :D
That reminds me that I should play Emerald again o.o

/me gzlines
me? no
I wasn't even supposed to know about this server
.-.
.-.
XD
I don't know how half of you got here
word of mouth sadly got people here
know how i found the server?
lmao
sadly?
i was googling "MtCharizard" one day
if ppl weren't here it'd be full of idling lurkers
and came across a pastebin of powerplants logs
and came
Cause of my people I mean
people I can be blamed for lol
went to ambernova website
You came?
derp
LOL
ambernova as in ambernova.net or ho-ohrealm.net?
i came
everywhere
;-;
ambernova.net
;-;
lol
you know what
[21:22:26] * Connecting to shadowfire.ho-ohrealm.net (10000)
[21:22:48] * Unable to connect to server (Connection timed out)
[21:22:53] * Connect retry #1 shadowfire.ho-ohrealm.net (10000)
I have my reasons
dodododo
i think everyone should invite everyone they know to this server/chan and ask those ppl to invite everyone they know and so on
to see how things turn out
8D
lmfao
ye
o_O
do that Presea
want to help me?
o_O
lets turn NS into a drinking game and sure
weird
what up presea
it doesn't seem to be down from what ESG says
uh
Everytime NS goes derp take a shot of pepsi
/me checks
XD
hello mtchar
hello

it is timing out
damn
I think someone shot up the firewall

hay dans, when are you going back to your desktop PC?

pffff, i hate sleepless nights
12lol
hi lu
03just a TS?
i could
but it would use up my internet quota for 2 days.
so i'm not gonna do it unless postal.
03eh we'll se
>H2O occurs every weekday
& when are you going back to your desktop PC?
03later
03I'm kinda preoccupied right now
03don't have the hard drive space to just store tses for a while?
I do
& i want you to turn off hyperthreading on your PC on next restart. It makes stuff run faster because of less context switching.
03>_>
12!pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 2Dwebble.
what?
03I want hyperthreading
becauuse
12finally somewhat done sorting cards
12i don't know why i insist on not putting cards away until i have a huge mountain of cards
03wtf, the DVD release of Man of the House is 4:3
screw hyperthreading
MULTICORE!
multicores have hyprethreading
(intel's i-series)
so drf, why do you want hyperthreading on?
Which is even more epic
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
03because showing as 8 CPUs FTW
03that way when a program locks up it only uses 12.5%
not really
03not 25
03just my luck
03the region 2 and 4 DVDs of Man of the House are 16:9
the radio station for Seattle's public schools on FM is running HD Radio
they must have a TON of money in the budget
its expensive to run the technology because you have to pay license fees to Ibiquity for each stream on top of buying the equipment
the cost for the equipment alone can be $75,000
sounds like a losing technology to me
that way when a program locks up it only uses 12.5% < that's a result of it showing as 8 cpus. it is actually stilll using up 25%.
yes
because they are VIRTUAL CORES
not physical cores
and with then non-sleeping, singlethreaded programs such as ffox & office that you use, HT off may make them go an iota faster
I have not even touched those kinds of settings
I still have the display of two physical cores
not even going to try hyper threading
o.o
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
did you turn off HT?
03no.
>.>
do you understand how HT works ? I didn't say what the task manager shows up, but how it works with task switching.
03yeah well I'd rather just leave it on.
becauuse
even if it works to your detriment
because it will
with single tasking stuff
because it
passes itself between different CPUs. and context passing actually consumes time.
it's small, but adds up to like, 3-7%
It's not actually consuming less CPU on locked tasks, either, but thats unfortunately how it's displayed on windows task manager. linux and unix don't show this bias (where CPU can go above 100%)
I would not suggest this to you, unless i thought it was to your benefit, and it probably would.
o-O
Lol windows.
lol Linux
linux is awesome.
04o-o
04so bored
DRAKE
it can't run 90% of the programs written for computers
04hi
TCTL
chapter 7 is up
more like 5% it can run
you mean consumer s0ftware.
04awesome
right
the only programs Linux can run are hobbyist ones and those that have been ported
I simply can't live in a non Windows world
I actually kinda like it
due to specialized hardware that is not compatible with Linux
consumer/commercial/whatever it's called software
linux actually has more applications available than windows
BS
04http://techpatio.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/linux_windows_mac_fanboys.jpg
04I think that says my thoughts on the matter.
it's just the more popular software
such as word, adobe's crap, etc.
is available for windows
as it's closed source
besides
open source > closed source
<3
and Drake, no one cares about you
>:3
04Oh well
ohaidere
ohai
its partially because Video4Linux over all sucks
its hardware support is not very good and not improving
every OS sucks in it's own way
exactly
Windows sucks in some ways
Linux sucks in some ways
Mac OS sucks in some ways
and embedded OS's
yes
they all have their faults it's just a matter of picking which one works out best for your needs is all
ugh, don't get me STARTED on the Linksys WRT implementation of VXWorks
ogod
VXworks
i flashed dd-wrt to my router
>.>
whats so bad about vxworks?
worked out far better for my needs
i can even use my router as a access point now
it's limited for one
I flashed DD-WRT to my router as well
are there any "better" embedded oses?
its greatly more reliable and has far more features
ya
including some that are normally found in routers that cost thousands
yes quite fun
such as WOL
>Video4Linux
mfw
linux has some crappy driver support
and doesn't support stuff that a lot of people need
not so
Video4Linux is something I have had tons of problems with
linux worked fine with my tv tuner
my pci one
not mine
yours is that HD tuner isn't it
mines just a standard
>.>
AND ITS NOT FUDGING GOING TO BE SUPPORTED ANY FLIPPING TIME SOON
ugh I hate this censor thing
censor?
oh
+G
+G +kill
not kill
it's kick
!swearstats
yeah, but that's because I don't give a <censored> about swearing.
shut up
!swearstats
orly
I am mostly here in case I need to talk to drf
<censored>
because he is too narrowminded to go anywhere except here and Pokemon-Orignals
lolwut
oh, so it got changed from kill to kick
nice
because of complaints from myself and a few others
when Articuno still came on here
well, he does go to disneyunvaulted
but thats a dead channel
personally I'd not have kicks at all
but it's not my decision
anyone under 13 in here
its the decision of the one who is killing the community
!swearstats
Number of badwords said for Drake: 1.
that's not me hopefully :x
dunno who your refering to
nah, that's somewan else
its Arti
she is killing the community
with her isolationism
well, she did come on earlier
amazing
so we'll see if she has changed
!seen Articuno
Articuno was last seen here 1 day, 8 hours, 46 minutes ago.
I certainly hope so
interesting
she used a different nick more recently

well anyway
bbl piano
i have a PC repair book that's like 4000
back in an hour and such
lol'd
it has a solution to every problem but yours!
no it really does cover everything
even down to how ppl tend to abuse their PCs and laptops
spilling soda on it, etc
dropping it
how to replace the mboard of a laptop
and so on
detailed specs on many CPU types and speeds from 1970 onward to 2009
what's a solution for bending your laptop screen all the time
shit won't close anymore ):
what's the issue exactly
is the screen warping when you close it
define warping
like it's being pressed from behind
by the plastic casing
or is it that you have to push it down harder then normal and your worried about breaking it
it doesn't have those clicker thingies so it just sits there like uh
...WHY IS THERE NO SYMBOL FOR THIS
clicker thing
okay | would be shut, and it's all /
you mean a latch
oh
yes
it's not closing all the way?
and latching
sure it's clean
or didn't come from china
piece of shit doesn't have a latch
compaq :L
china then
and it's comcrap
that sucks
well did you see if anything is out of place
makes creeky noises when i adjust the top part thing
idonno ;~;
oh ya then it's dirty
How do clean.
damp cloth
bairly wet
canned air also works
a vaccum
this is what i got
ya the issue would probably be around the side henges
clean that area as best you can
alright
open the laptop screen as far as possible
and clean inbetween the areas
crumbs, crumbs fucking everywhere
woo
that's slightly better
years of crap
lol
what are you doing eating around a laptop/PC
anyways

i bet your keyboard is also dirty

Decided to come back lol
04What bought you here?
lol
04Ah
04She can be persuasive
Indeed lol
And lol I only need one more achievement for Spyro only too me 10hour 41minutes and 37seconds of gameplay time
04o-o
04whoa
04Spyro should seriously have a difficulty setting.
04And online play for the 360
Yeah
04Would've been so much more fun
come to think of it i have a spyro game for ps2
04Which one?
Even though the game is easy, it's still extremely Fun
i think the last one they made for it
Heroes Tail, Enter the Dragonfly, A New Beginning, The Eternal Night or Dawn of the Dragon
eternal night
Ah
Didn't really like that one
lol
well it's here, but not mine and has been kinda sitting around
one of my old friends let me borrow it then they moved to another state
forgot i had it till just now
I still have the Legend of Spyro series on the PS2 but no console to play them on lol
ah
04Eternal Night
04is a Nightmare
/me shot
xD
I completed it like any Spyro game I've played
Apart from EtD
I couldn't stand that one XD
04blah
04I have EtD
04Haven't touched it.
I still have it, just don't really want to play it
Gamecube version though lol so yeah
04PS2 version
heh i guess it's like how ppl like tales of symphina but not the second one
symphonia
the sequels to anything always suck
not always
evil dead 2 was better then evil dead

I was watching it live, someone was streaming it live.
Saw that advert, it was awesome.
I always forget when they're streaming it and end up just finding the episodes on youtube
b/c in real life small children fling their regular bowls of food around on the way to their fishing trip

Studying, huh?

or the other way around
and make it esplode!
whichever would help me memorize it
Lol, it'll do that anyway

The smirk was back in place. "Oh, am I sir to you now? Ah, forgive me, my name is Rathicus. My partner is Dragoran. We are terrorists from an underground criminal organization." Rathicus had no qualms with telling a small child whose death was so close about the organization. There was nothing it could do about it anyway.

/me Now Playing: The OneUps - Bowser Castle
its a simple one which some might find questionable
running mIRC and your media player in administrator mode
xD
I use Winamp
:3
. -.
Winamp ftw
AMIP is available for Winamp, Foobar2000, and iTunes
its also where i broadcast my Radio Nintendo Show from as well ^^
Baby was arrested in Britain for being racist
Winamp is decent for broadcasting
believe me I would know
I don't use SAM Broadcaster yet
Winamp+Stereo Tool=WIN!
SAM is just too complex for me atm
Apperantly it was squinting its eyes when it was born
It wasn't tired it was doing impressions of chinese people
heh
the reason why those 8 bit chip tunes are distorting is because there is quite a bit in the treble
heh i dun have enough 8-bit in the show
using a processor will allow you to flaten the audio response out and thus prevent distortion at high levels
XD
your apparent loudness could be much higher

up to a 30 uS (micro second) curve
ahh
LOL I know that one
and YESH i remixed thee famous Windows Midi
<3333
I have never really used it because AM and FM require more of a pre-emphasis
Mine doesnt sound like the crap ones ive heard before
awesome
FM requires a 75 uS curve in the United States and 50 uS elsewhere in the world
oh
AM uses a modified 75 uS curve but I found that the European 50 uS FM curve matches this very closely through some research
hehe you know alot about broadcasting ^^;
this is only important if you are doing over the air
for internet radio this level is not required
well yea
I have a great deal of interest in the technical side
but with internet radio isn't it kind of tricky
/me Now Playing: S.S.T. Band - Tetremix
I can't really answer that one
if you go onto a website like live 365 it can take longer to load than connecting to a radio network with winamp
on FM I had a killer setup which was on a par with the big broadcasters in terms of technical standards
I mean, how often is it that you see a low power FM station with DYNAMIC SCROLLING RDS!
you mostly see it when your next to a tower
this was too cool
I was able to send out full song and artist information
to specially designed FM receivers
nighty night
:3
Sleep well
/me huggles back
also by tweaking an AM setting a bit I adapted it for Motorola C-QUAM AM stereo
and it seems to work quite well
/me huggles back
ahhh
on wideband AM stereo receivers the sound quality rivals FM plus its possible to have BETTER than FM frequency response
I even killed the audio bandpass filter in the software for a test to see what it could sound like without any filtering
on my wideband AM stereo monitor receiver it put FM to shame
now what?
We wait. See what happens.
AMIP-wise?
launch your media player
it's open
as admin
did you see the text on the status window turn red?
I mean its bar in mIRC
click on that and you should see this
*** AMIP v2.67 enabled - type /dde mPlug help to get help and /dde mPlug options to configure AMIP
*** Manual mode: use /dde mplug announce to show now playing info
if you see text like that then AMIP is working
there was no red
but did you see the text I pasted in the status window?
oh... I see it
try playing a song and then type the trigger
/me np: Nobuo Uematsu - The Man with the Machine Gun [02:49m/193kbps/44kHz]

congratulations
its working
next thing to consider is the AMIP configurator

It's like IMDB, but for cars
I only recognize two of those
the Harley Davidson motorcycle and the Toyota Dyna
from episodes
So the police cars they use in the Unova region is based on an actual concept police car in the U.S.
Interesting
I recognised that Volkswagen Van
the three others I have never seen in episodes
I remember watching that episode
not me
and then, "VOLKSWAGEN?!??!?!??!?"
I quit long before that one aired
ok
what was it
03What's the highest legal frequency for FM radio in the US
too easy
03yeah
107.9
03for some it might not be
03but yep
here is a more obscure one
who invented frequency modulation?
03um, dunno
Edwin H Armstrong
well now you do
03XD
another good one
03there was one about satellite radio too
03apparently the FCC approved it back in 1992
03I had guessed 2004, I had no idea it was that old
true or false, AM stations in the US have NEVER been able to run more than 50,000 watts
03I'm guessing false
CORRECT!
03finally found working download links
WLW 700 in Cincinatti Ohio ran 500,000 watts in the 1930s under special authorization
03how far would that reach?
it was heard in Europe nightly
03wow
as for satellite radio it was in limbo for many years
Sirius was poised to be the first direct broadcast satellite radio provider to ever serve the US
but technical problems resulted in the launch being pushed back to 2001 not long after XM
03yeah, that's why I was like wtf at 1992
03but apparently the FCC allowed satellite radio frequencies that earluy
03-uu
yes
that is when they allocated part of the S band for said purpose
03S band?
microwave band around 2.3 GHz
03o.o
03isn't that awfully close to the 2.4GHz that routers and whatnot use?
yes but there is absolutely no risk of bleed over
there's over nine thouSAAAND hertz in between
802.11
so yea.
03Yes I know "802.11" but I'm not quite sure what that means
03as I've also seen it written as 2.4GHz
designation that the IEEE uses for the technology
its just a random standards number
03ah

WHYY.
03it's a lot better than the one that comes with sysreset
you need to set foobar to winamp emulation mode
03that one is so plain and boring
because
it's all colourful
and uses bg colours
03and?
o.o
03this channel uses colors

03*it's
03well
Lol well honestly...
03technically if I kicked someone for pissing me off, that's abuse of power.
03which is why I don't do that.
Minnet is an Aperture Science Artifical Intelligence Construct
Minnet, please say "excuse me"
Excuse me?

Nooo
even against Lua-scripted bots.
nevverr
03I wouldn't just ban people because I don't like them
Oh noes, this is the part where he logs the channel

o.o
I have different ways of approaching things.
Minnet say hi to Lakorv
Excuse me?
I'm a biiiit less lenient
o3o
drf, you heard of reconnecting?
03RioX, don't worry about.
03*it
03some people have problems with me hosting one of the servers
drf
03which is, quite honestly, a bit silly. Because it's not like I've abused my power or anything
I really dont like that either.
and well
because of things I can't go into really
it's just...
Ugh
o3o
and
LOOOOL
Hawk.
03o.o
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawk.
03how can you not go into them
03that doesn't really help me at all
I didn't even know the old server wasn't being hosted on TST anymore
._.
/me grabs a random hawk, and snugs it
03this server basically never goes down,.
Lakorv, it depends, I had to ban a few people in my time. Curse of the admin :/
But
I have ways with people
even then they like me
Gurantee it
because I'm reasonable
03Sure
03what's the command to show uptime in Linux :P
If this server ever goes down, you remove this server and leave TST forever
Seriously
03o_O
03that seems a bit harsh, don't you think?
What
it's kinda silly for you to be bashing nest though..
it's unwarranted.
03I'm not bashing it
well
uptime: /usr/bin/uptime /usr/share/man/man1/uptime.1.gz
03I'm just saying that statistically this server is a lot better
you're constantly being down on it.
03that's a fact, it can be proven.
Eh
03k, my server has an uptime of 22 days right now
Doesn't either one connect to this any time?
