Most rap music is horrible
But this is pretty good
I can't think of much rap music I like

:O
I'd maybe have a cat I owned neutered, but not declawed
my kitty's previous owner declawed him
ikr!!
Whoever edited/made that script must be trippin something
They think of declawing differently in Europe than they do in Amuricah
if my nails get long enough its like i have claws... very easy to scracth ppl
Lol.
they have barely any structure to them, they're just like fuzzy blobs attached to arms
:o
cat can i has another vid?
declawing is forbidden in the EU unless it's essential for the health of the animal
<3
it's completely outlawed in the UK
yes
You peeps don't like to have any fun over there
You enjoy cruelty?
srsly
no
if thats an at at walker doing the caramelldansen

03what's that
I was being kinda sarcastic :3 .... I'm the most liberal person in Alabama
she might to be dramatic sounding like a movie, all kids do that
/me doesn't like declawing or capital punishment
its a cockney slang for hara kiri I think which is suicide in japanese
I think
I just live here Cat :3
Don't blame me D:
idk I'm not gonna make any accusations quite yet I'll just watch it unfold I guess
No one cares about being dramatic if they actually lose someone.
good point...
They only do that when they want attention.

No no no no no yes?

I'd be embarassed on their behalf if I was involved in any of the dramatic arts.

Hey, want to cause some disruptions on epic-chat?

gah, I had to link the shortened radio version of the song :/

Shortened version, very typical.
its still loading.
That's all we ever get is the shortened version.
Can't we ever get something with LENGTH?
LOL
I linked a thirteen-minute long song earlier D:
Damn, that's a long one.
it was awesome too
longest song I have is 39 minutes I think
:)
He was okay.
if it doesn't load, have this song instead http://youtu.be/F4lViga2wgs
I wouldn't want to make anyone self-conscious...

srsly her father isn't that bad it's not like he raped her or something
Oh, I have to see this.
hey I found Umby
jk
She actually alluded to that.
But it's just another exciting piece of the drama plot she's making.
NO FATHER EVER CALLS THEIR DAUGHTER PRETTY UNLESS THEY WANT TO GET UNDER THE DRESS
nah it
it's backwards of Gemma which is a character in the books

"Mpre money for me"
that's terrible
If he's as bad as she claims, you'd think they'd say he's probably not in a good place.
you need to be aggressive if you are a street preformer.
That's pretty much the answer she was asking for, if you read the post.
Lol.
BECAUSE PEOPLE HARDLY EVER CHEAT ON EACHOTHER
Yeah, but they're really agressive about it ... it's a cultural thing
Why not just cremate him and eat him with milk? :)
They're very blunt about things in their culture
Mmm, tasty.
yeah I noticed that
they are actually the same way even when they come live in another country

yet another retard from PS
7Hack me a male Macargo with Heat Wave. :P
7('cause that would actually allow me some use)
Male + Heat = wow
4i can only hack shinyness and pokemonness
7Darn.
4not moves
4sowwy
lol
7Eh, then give me a normal Seedot.
4oh, and levelness
4i won!!!
7If you have a D/P/HG/SS, then get a Shiftry, teach it Defog, then transfer it.
4i don't have 4th gen
7Ah.
4besides
7Because I'd like Defog for competitive play. :P
4defog is a hm, can't be transfered
7It can.
7Complicated, but works.
4???
4i dun get it
4explain please
7Defog is only a HM in D/P.
7It's replaced by Whirlpool in HG/SS.
4so, googolated
7Y'can't get me a Defog Shiftry, I'll guess. :P
04I just saw Toy Story 3...
04Dang....
04also wait
04(yay, VERY yay)
XD
??????????????????????/
4i'm sowwy, i'm a BAD PERSON!!! D'X
same
04Quan really?
7Nyeh?
04So no whirlpool in HGSS or Defog in DPPt, but vice-versa is okay?
04Cool I guess o.o
7(And Shiftry on a Sun team, which I'm hoping to build. >>)
7But yeah, actually getting a Shiftry with Defog is going to be D:
04Why?
7 1: get a Seedot on D/P. 2, evolve it and teach it Defog. 3. Send it to HG/SS. 4. Transfer it to B/W. 5. Breed for optimal stats.

How do they calculate how much damage something does?

07there's a calculator for that, but I don't know the actual values off the top of my head

07found the formula

04my wrist still hurts ;-;
okay
That's reasonably easy to code
04Also fun fact: computers aren't really suppose to be random
07also there's stat changes too, but that's easy
04Am I correct?
yeah stat changes are easy
STAB is how much again?
and weakness/resistance?
071.5
072
072, 4, 1/2, and 1/4
Oh right
yeah that's easy
07if you're gonna stick in all the typings
04wait
it's not too hard
07how about swords dance/growl/etc?
or lower
07k
07so in order

am I even bothered enough to do those?
I need to get a list of 5th gen moves
I have all the ones from 1-4
07the stat changes happen after the main calculation
Sp, for the fun... here's that formula in APL:
DAM ← ⌊((16? + 84) × WEAKRES × STAB × 2 + ((⌊(POW ÷ DEF)) × ATK × 2 + 2 × ⌊(LVL ÷ 5)) ÷ 50) ÷ 100
04Let alone nature?
lmao Creideiki
(APL: Operator precedence is right-to-left evaluation, no precedence.)
nature
screw nature
04:c
well
if you REALLY want nature
I can do it
04well for coding sake
04I guess it's negligable
07nature and statuses are harder lol
04Are you going to be doing leveling up?
04OH LOL
04This would be epic
statuses would be a bit hard
04Everyone's level is their idlerpg level

and I don't know how to make games lol
Let's make it ourselves
except battle 4 that was amazing
if I could steal WoW's engine then maybe
CHRONICLES
NO
;.;
Kill it
GAMEBOY QUALITY MUSIC GTFO
YES
My ears
gameboy music was good
RSE's music was nice
But on a DS music
Songs except intro bad
Um
No I mean
:P
GBA quality on a DS
no
GB quality -.-
It sounded crappy
anyway
LET'S GET TO SCRIPTING
actually
finding 5th gen moves first
They shoulda hired Snappleman
/me runs
hm
I'm not doing abilities
no natures either
unless you still want them
but they'll have no effect on stats
http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/cit_internet_on_a_disk.jpg
<Chimera> They shoulda hired Snappleman < You seriously havent heard his doomsday remix?
And yes I did
It's awesome
Shes on :3
Ugh my wrist hurts waaay too much ;-;
awesome
found a list
and then if gedit's find/replace doesn't work I can use nightshadow|VNC's regex script
NS, RJ is on IRC

Hi drf :3
http://pastebin.com/jeNDA300
there's a list of 5th gen only moves
LOL
ED
now
actually
why don't I just leave out 5th gen moves
I'm lazy
Lol
effort >:
Most of them are evil anyway
Incinerate and acrobatics
Can screw you over
ouch

Wow
now that'd hurt
Seeing how drf got pwned all the time xD

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
Fuuuuuuuuu ;<
anyway
anyone
want to help me with this script?
no
;p
damnit VNC
stop screwing up
lmao
why is it that in every single script I have
I have about 50+ brackets?
I dunno?
XD
in the swearkick script
I have like
30
the fight script has over 100
about 150
wtf
I'd help
But I can't
;-;
I think I mostly need data
because the scripting shouldn't be that hard
considering I have the base code

http://failblog.org/2011/05/05/epic-fail-photos-engrish-funny-honest-and-cheap/
radio and TV transmission antennas only concentrate energy into the horizontal plane resulting in a radiation pattern much like a doughnut
wider coverage but more difficult reception very close to the tower in many cases
just my two cents about the RF issue
o_o
no...?
I know that
just explaining it in a simpler way using something that people are familiar with
03XD
03hm
03Cherry Dr. Pepper doesn't taste much different than the normal kind
X-chat does /amsg on every single window
not just the network
it's annoying
...amsg is always annoying
amsg?
yeah amsg is annoying
prints that crap on every channel on the network (on mIRC)
:3

really?
03god dang it you guys
03I went to type "ew that face" in Xbox live when it asked me to type in my email

07we've gone over this with other things lol
woah when did those get added
oh yeah
lmao
yes
You still need to email me D:
I'm lazy
requires me to go through my email for the pics
and then click forward
and wait for it to send
and then type "HEY I SENT IT"
03LOL
03CENSORED YOU ALL
...lmao
LOL
03also :O one more view
LOL
03also it's 12:34 right now
haha
07evasion is nothing unless raised
but wait
07well
07100%
07no
hm
the evasion% is the same as any other stat changes amirite?
07nope lol
._.
be back in ~30 minutes
OH
I get it
thanks
07in any case, here
07http://www.legendarypokemon.net/battlemech
07there's the ratios for evasion and accuracy
lmao nice
hm
everyone starts on level 1
07level 5
start on level 5?
07yeah
base stats 8 or something?
Allo!
damnit
I'll be back in 30 minutes
12!Kyu
07ohai
12how goes
na na na na na na na na na na BATCHMAN
/me flops
I'M OUT OF SHAPE
hm
derp
back
07because that's where starters start :D
lmao
12kyu DX
/me puts you on his head
07eep
07?
12when you were more active
07o3o
well
I guess
07stat increases per level from 1-4
07just because there's no way to do EVs and IVs lol
well EVs and IVs would be retarded lol because there'd be no point
Probably could do it but it'd be extremely difficult
equations with massive amounts of brackets*
12Ascendant
07well you can't have EVs without every battler having real base stats
07same with IVs lol
12oh
well EVs I definitely can't do
IVs possibly
as they're kinda set/random
07and I don't think there is a IV/base stat/nature calculation that I can find
Is there even one? Or is it just random?
I'm not doing natures for now
Too difficult to calculate
well if I (or you) can find that calculation I'll add it
hm
(2*BST+5+IV+(EV/4))*nature effect
(2*BST+10+100+IV+(EV/4)
but that's level 100
oh wait
07so you'd give everyone a random IV for each stat at level 5
07and have that calculate their starting stats
Yeah
07and that would mean you don't have to deal with EVs
Hm
EVs I doubt I can do
I mean
hidden power
I have the calculation for hit points
;o
yeah
but well
07I'd skip that too lol
...weather.
07uh
/me dies
07base stats don't total 100
IVs?
07I meant 100 per base stat
07so it would total 600, like Mew/etc
oh right
Yeah
that'd be fairer
07weather is a simple multiplier for rain and sun
well, I could do weather, but yeah, those 2 would be dodgy
07not to mention Poison
as readini bawwwws at searches
07Toxic
07Spikes
07TOXIC SPIKES
toxic spikes, spikes etc. I'm removing
xD
lmao
07XD
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
lolwut?
I kept thinking it was Waltzing Matilda but no, not quite
12o-O
04ohai
derp
I know that now
well I am an American
yeah derp
not ignorant though
07the battle would just be !fight (whoever) and it outputs one line just like it is now right
Probably
07so anyone could battle anyone at any time
interesting thing is it did not become official until 1984
07I dun need it =P
And yeah, they could
07so if there's nothing that keeps it one-on-one
07pretty much everything turn based can be take nout
12hmm
and they can't spam crap
the Star Spangled Banner became the US national anthem by an act of president Franklin D Roosevelt in 1931
might make a few versions of the script
however it was written in 1812
to overcome crappy problems
well
because the system would be weird
Hm
._.
07well
...oh dear
wow
07I say start with 2 wins gives 1 level at the start, and add 1 more win needed every 2 levels
07so lv5 needs 2 wins, lv7 needs 3, 9 needs 4, etc
but lol
/timer 1000 0 /msg # !fight
xD
heh
>healing moves
07also
hm?
That's fairly easy to do
it's the same as the rest of my floodkill systems
that I use for ScriptBot's scripts

04I finally got a Mohran Brace from rewards as well.
04Hopefully I can get some more today
06Uh okay, completely random disconnect
03Sometimes
03but it's getting all the other crap needed .-.
Like? lol
04Not for me.
Everyone has different luck on Tri. Some people have it raining Gems, but nothing else.
Oh, yeah. I was there to hear you complain. XD
03To be honest though once you hit HR 100+
04Yes
04ONCE
04ONCE YOU DO
03WELL DO IT THEN
03DO IT NAO
04Until then I'll beat the creators for making Plate's have 3% drop rates

I became Patriarch of the Temple and Arch-Master of House Redoran 8D
Doing Fighter's Guild and Thieves Guild
13;;
04ikr?
Which is why you don't need to take them seriously.
03That would be hilariously cruel
06Sometimes it feels like 60% accuracy or something
06and it seems like moves like hypnosis has 90% accuracy for NPC's too. But anyway, it does make things exciting~
04o-o
Rayyyy. Dang, he promised me a brawl today.
03BRAWL?
03DID SOMEBODY SAY BRAWL?
03=DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
13when put together, it ends up being complete BS
7o.o
7Or Sleep Talk. :P
04aye?
13At least I now know that Darkrai is, in fact, a pure dark-type and actually has weaknesses |D
13I used to think it was ghost-dark until recently
I need a brawl. XD
7Lol, AE.

03Manly I'll brawl you if you give me like
03need to do a handful of things first
04uh

13I'm not busy~
13But I'm also not motivated~
02I'm open for brawling
lmfao
7Ah.
7Hmm, not bad;
04I cbb to train anymore.
04I never play online.
02But warning: my internetz is Failing, like a boss.
7And open doesn't neutralize levels.
03Manlyguy
7So, yeah.
03I am
03ALWAYS
03free to brawl
02LOL craig
02xD
7Audinos help.
02^
13I've been casually training up my HG team for the past year now, and are only just reaching lv 80
12Hi Manlyguy!
hey Manly
oh whoa my nick
Hey. xD
13and even then, I only trained them to about lv 42-45
12XD
7Audinos give LOADS of Exp.
03Right brb
03and when I get back
13how do you get to Kyurem?
03Brawl teim
7You know that forest, right?
02AE:
7Get to it, and Kyurem freezes the area.
02Through a pineapple, under the sea. [/jk]
13Oh, really?
13Maybe that didn't happen because it happened to already be Winter in-game while I was there |D
13Thanks :P
02But PROTIP:
7Then you can get to Kyurem's chamber.
12Angel_Espeon have you got storms over there? :>
13Nope o.o Just rain
13I assume it's rained anyway, since the ground is wet

03heueueueueueue
o.o
03Thank you
04lololol
that I forgot about the main quest
04Good plan though
I got 19 K
04Get stronger
04...
Veloth's Judgement
04I have like, 490K
Full Redoran Armor
04From summon-abusing
one is my manor
Indray inbetween Ald'Ruhn
and Maar Gan
Second is in Pelegiad
Also
I mean I have the Lord's Mail
and pratically am the best warrior
i got 100 long blade
04I dunno
and 85 in Blunt
04Lord's mail doesn't even look cool
It doesn't
but Ebony's Mail and Tribunals armor along with Redoran..
04And I got that awesome sword.
04Magic is AWESOME
But I don't want to join Imperial Cult
i fucking hate them
04Don't join them then
But
themoneh
andthequests
andtheexperience
04lol
I know I don't
04The cult has you gathering money from commoners and collecting items around cities.
I know
04It's not worth it
thats why I hate them
because they do it for the money
the Temple has more justice then them
and its the Temple
and partly wrong
Though I also ask
I mean I know i get Spell-Breaker as a item
and get to kill moar demons for Lord Molag Bal
but it just seems tedious
find a specific member
join the clan
do their shit
the most unholy place in Vvardenfell
AndI found M'iaq
04._.
04no
04It's not really worth it
I know
the Corpus section
I kinda figured that out when you're suppose to go to Tel Fyr
due to House Redoran
why are to to befall on such simple diseases?
But I gotta tell you
Veloth Judgement etc
are worth getting for two reasons
two you can sell them to this lady in Tribunal
bad-days for me
i'd do it only for the quests
04Hmm
04I don't know
04Wait, do you have Azura's Star?
Not yet
I didn't visit her shrine
but I know itys in the south east part of Vvardenfell
04You really should
near Molag Mar and some ruins
04even if you don't have a good skill in enchanting, it's worth it.
because its Azura's star
04XD
but yeah
I could just use console code
do the quests
and then do the quest for vamprism cure

do you want to do some of it, Quilava?
eh.
K cool
XD okay
not particularly, but I suppose it has to get done
nah it's fine
pokemondb.net is a good site for it
14o.o
hopefully its not too much of a pain
just time consuming
14Night everyone
okay.
I'm not doing PP
because that'd make it go full retard
Hmm.
did I mention I'm finally getting some commissions again?
uh....
I don't think you did
what's a commission again? xD
probably not
/braindead
its when people pay me to do arts :P
Sooooo
Nice :o
you should do some for HoR
/me hides
thanks :P
lawl
oh fuck
I just realised
I'll just add in an extra field
hm.
the probabilities too...
http://pokemondb.net/move/doubleslap
Yeah
probabilities shouldn't be too hard
just $r(1,8)
1~3 is twice, 4~6 is 3 times, etc
12o-o
that's fine then
trying to think of the point of an "effect" field in the database
as in
how would it help the script?
03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/chatroulette-trolling-narnia.jpg
you mean like status effect?
yeah
eh
those don't really seem like they'd be too useful
I could probably remove the effect field
since this isn't ACTUALLY turn based..
things like paralysis would just mean you have to spam fight more
I'm removing most status effects
and sleep. and freeze.
ok
lol, freeze
the only ones I would consider keeping would be sleep, freeze and paralysis
seriously?
but dunno
wadda fuck
I'd definitely not keep poison/burn etc.
how would they work in the script?
are you racist
03*WB02(Lyon02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
well
you dont like purple do you.
with paralysis
..won't that just encourage more spamming of the script?
you won't go anywhere
probably
well, I'll get rid of that then
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDhR7jUjzcY
honestly I was seeing it the other way around
where you keep burn/poison and such
Hm
perhaps
but I'd only make them go for a few times
otherwise it'd kill them off very quickly
not that much
it was either 1/8 or 1/16
http://oi56.tinypic.com/nwf1c5.jpg
then again
you can always just leave statuses out completely
I might keep them in
just to make it more interesting
can't be that hard to code either way
just more time required
tedious, not hard
yeah
then we have toxic
because you'll also have to add in probability of effect.
well, I'd just add in an extra field saying the effect, and the script can do its $rand thing
and the effect comes into play
and then do $rand(1,$readini(battlemovedb.txt,shockwave,probability))
or something
oh.

hi lu
bai
03you could totally do a frame by frame restoration
03would be tedious and a pain but would work
03^ DVD master
03I can author this into VTS and then shrink it
/me hides
03orly now
yes.
03as it needs more than just denoising
03there's tracking lines on the screen, colors are faded, etc
*motion-compensated grain addition, *stabilization, *S,B, YUV, *denoising, *sharpening possibly (but there's no detail to sharpen)
03not realy, they're analog
03so they have no resolution
03they're 480 "scan lines" but yes it would be roughtly 240 I think
03*what
saturation, brightness
03hm
since VHS is analogue, you can capture it at any resolution, including 1080p. but that would not be sensible, because there's not much detail at that resolution.
03I recorded it at 480i, as >DVD
k, mb 360p then?
anything that works
03IVTC for example would be stupid in this case
03well you did a good job on the Eagle ceremony
03but I don't suppose you want to try to fix up my parents' wedding :P
03that's why I said "want to"
i'm more of a practical dude cuz i use the tools
03eh
&mb SRC
03all I know how to do is normalize, LOL
03in this case, it's *faded*
03like
&mb un DRC
03the parts where there's a band playing music
sound is "muffly"
03*record
03yeah, that.
03I wouldn't know how to fix that
03the volume is fine, it's just faded
a exciter, possibly.
03wtf is an exciter
03hm
its analog, but about 48-64?
03I woulda thought more like 128kbps but whatever
>crap in, crap out
03because I mean, I've had music videos on VHS, they aren't that bad
03but yeah I know
oh?
03hold on
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVoWD7ARe9s
03this wasn't recorded by me
03but I recorded that same commercial
03and it sounded about the same
03the music in the background is not that bad
03I guess
03not now though

06Well, that's competitive for you.
7Indeed.

Thank you for being a good person ;D

03wtf, the DVD release of Man of the House is 4:3
screw hyperthreading
MULTICORE!
multicores have hyprethreading
(intel's i-series)
Which is even more epic
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
03because showing as 8 CPUs FTW
03that way when a program locks up it only uses 12.5%
not really
03not 25
03just my luck
03the region 2 and 4 DVDs of Man of the House are 16:9
03but the American one is 4:3
the radio station for Seattle's public schools on FM is running HD Radio
they must have a TON of money in the budget
its expensive to run the technology because you have to pay license fees to Ibiquity for each stream on top of buying the equipment
the cost for the equipment alone can be $75,000
that way when a program locks up it only uses 12.5% < that's a result of it showing as 8 cpus. it is actually stilll using up 25%.
yes
because they are VIRTUAL CORES
not physical cores
I have not even touched those kinds of settings
I still have the display of two physical cores
not even going to try hyper threading

it's just the more popular software

as it's closed source

04Oh well
ohaidere
its partially because Video4Linux over all sucks
its hardware support is not very good and not improving
every OS sucks in it's own way
exactly
Mac OS sucks in some ways
and embedded OS's
yes
ogod
VXworks
i flashed dd-wrt to my router
>.>
i can even use my router as a access point now
it's limited for one
I flashed DD-WRT to my router as well
are there any "better" embedded oses?
its greatly more reliable and has far more features
ya
including some that are normally found in routers that cost thousands
yes quite fun
such as WOL
>Video4Linux
mfw
Video4Linux is something I have had tons of problems with
my pci one
not mine
yours is that HD tuner isn't it

detailed specs on many CPU types and speeds from 1970 onward to 2009

is the screen warping when you close it

you mean a latch

Yes I am a lagmera
whats a lagmera?
plus it does offer pre-emphasis which is supposed to help with compressed audio output
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDhR7jUjzcY <3
up to a 30 uS (micro second) curve
ahh
LOL I know that one
<3333
I have never really used it because AM and FM require more of a pre-emphasis
Mine doesnt sound like the crap ones ive heard before
awesome
FM requires a 75 uS curve in the United States and 50 uS elsewhere in the world
actually 75 uS is used in most of the Americas
oh
AM uses a modified 75 uS curve but I found that the European 50 uS FM curve matches this very closely through some research
this is only important if you are doing over the air
well yea
I have a great deal of interest in the technical side

AMIP-wise?

click on that and you should see this

*** Manual mode: use /dde mplug announce to show now playing info
if you see text like that then AMIP is working

oh... I see it
try playing a song and then type the trigger
/me np: Nobuo Uematsu - The Man with the Machine Gun [02:49m/193kbps/44kHz]
congratulations
its working
next thing to consider is the AMIP configurator
its an entirely graphical configuration tool for AMIP which allows you to adjust settings easily including advanced ones

Oh nice
It's like IMDB, but for cars
I only recognize two of those
from episodes
Interesting
I recognised that Volkswagen Van
the three others I have never seen in episodes
I remember watching that episode
not me
and then, "VOLKSWAGEN?!??!?!??!?"
I quit long before that one aired
ok
too easy
03yeah
107.9
03for some it might not be
03but yep
here is a more obscure one
03um, dunno
Edwin H Armstrong
well now you do
03XD
another good one
03there was one about satellite radio too
03apparently the FCC approved it back in 1992
03I had guessed 2004, I had no idea it was that old
03I'm guessing false
CORRECT!
03finally found working download links
03how far would that reach?
03wow
as for satellite radio it was in limbo for many years
Sirius was poised to be the first direct broadcast satellite radio provider to ever serve the US
but technical problems resulted in the launch being pushed back to 2001 not long after XM
03yeah, that's why I was like wtf at 1992
03but apparently the FCC allowed satellite radio frequencies that earluy
03-uu
yes
03S band?
microwave band around 2.3 GHz
03o.o
03isn't that awfully close to the 2.4GHz that routers and whatnot use?
yes but there is absolutely no risk of bleed over
there's over nine thouSAAAND hertz in between
802.11
03as I've also seen it written as 2.4GHz
designation that the IEEE uses for the technology
03ah
!define IEEE
-!- The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers or IEEE (read eye-triple-ee) is an international non-profit, professional organization for the advancement of technology related to electricity. ...
you shouldve herd about it when u were doing engineeering.
possibly has not heard of the SBE either
