hhhhiiiii
For now x)
I feel my pride is hurt due to the fact I lost to a fucking Blissy
How are you?
alright
bye ppl
666?
I'm taking a break right now
ahh lol, just making sure
Yes.
I never got the point of EV's and IV's
who's up next?
NEXT-----
Oh wait we didnt wrong person
WHpp[s
EVs were easier
I have to admit, we did make a lot of mistakes in the course of the Vietnam war. Pulling out at the time that we did was probably the worst by far.
xDD
IVs are a little confusing
'night all
G'night everypony.
who's streaming next?
00,03I used to battle competitively during Gen4
IV's are 10000000times more complex
'Cause this is filler <--- Filler Time!
o.0
Hot Cocoooooooooooooo
You know how Mewtwo is supposed to be menacing?\
hes is?
I haven't played in quite some time
natures and EVs are the main things i pay attention to
xD
My mewtwo is special
Guess why it is
I want hot cocoooo
IV is individual value
Oh yeah
cant be changed over time, its when you catch it i think
*everypony
EV's come with the nature and IV's come with things like "likes to eat"
00,03Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhzwnkWYjx4&list=FLUTJAI-vpHNAYH9eOVmrZSw&index=54&feature=plpp_video
Cello
00,03I'm Sculp20 on it
IVs if i am correct, are set when you catch them
okay that sucked :)
oh fail

I set my xbox to redownload all the borderlands dlcs, although it keeps disconnecting
I stopped after season 2

Mmm
00,03Sure http://derpy.me/hJkr6

rotmg?
It kept him from using electic attacks
Hi all.
Wait, any stream right now?
You guys wanna watch the most.. random movie you've seen in a while?? =O
ROTMG IS WIN
Prepare!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arH3od_2xIg&feature=related
anyway if any of you guys are any good ill gladly recruit you to ragnarok :)
XD
O
night guys
memes are good
say, what's the movie night going to be?
You know whats weird
You put Entei to sleep yet it can still flee
Just kidding
you freeze them,they run
mean look I think :)
Also I tried to use arena trap on entei it didnt wwork
Stronghold reminds me of endless online....
I think it either killed me, or it used roar
Raikou and Entei dont care.
WallDives........And R-Truth and Kofi are tag champs!
... All i say. Is blissy- With counter.
xD
yes
actually
Also I was sad nearly half of my 100/70 team died to a level 1 cottenee
with ...
watching some skyrim :)
Stupid substitute/leech seed ploy
OOHHH
umm, I want to say loudred with some sort of block move works wonders
It's because Cottonees/Whismicotts are fucking trolls.
something with soundproof and block ;)
also, Best match was either Punk/Jericho or Brian/Lawler.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwFZYCwnS0
then it fucking used a damage builder move
12wheeeeee
then i got trolled by a breeloom with spore/lowkick spam
