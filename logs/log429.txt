13ian james corlett, voicing bob
13did goku
No.1?
goku sounds like a girl in japanese
/me tosses Mad Milk onto the chat
13hack and slash, voiced by rattrap and optimus primal
cachi01: he does, supposed to convey his innocence IIRC
13Raindrops keep falling on my head~
Also, Shizuka, the new newsletter made me think of you :3 :3
Pinkie Pie sounds like a man in Russian
MrSnugglewoods: NO
LOL
lol
13ikr~
cachi01, I think the japanese voice complements his childlike character better
14o.o
yeah
ooooooh
/me stops throwing water to AE
14sorry
13we thought a bit too late to do roseluck for my meet the mods whenever we get to it, but kirz doesn't do the thursday letters <3
12and just like the guy who's feet were too big for his bed~
Bowm chika wow wow
okay this is getting creepy
lol
the hell
AHHAHAHA
yeah but it sounds odd when the father of 2 sounds like a little kid RainbowAsh
In the Japanese version, one of the Ginyu Force gets decapitated by Vegeta. In the US version, he just died. Meh.
OHH movie cliche
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1927/ :3
lol Bob
Goku was voiced by a woman. He was a young child from the beginning and when the storyline called for him to grow up into an adult, fans were horrified to the thought that Goku would be recast, so his original Seiyuu stayed on the role all the way.
#1? is this no more heroes?
alexxm: have u seen TheRainbowDash today? i'd like to show something to..(her ,right?)
alexxm, he doesn't act like a typical father, either
Birdie

I somehow managed to pick the route in the game that so closely mirrored my first relationship, it's almost scary.
9's back hurts
RX-78-SweetieBot: it is
Shizuka: well I got the link for the lottery but the newsletter isn't showing in my email is all.
ah. i found out where. the prisoner(1967) "I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered. My life is my own. I resign."
RX-78-SweetieBot: yeah. made, surprisingly enough, by some people from 4chan.
DAT FACE
look mom! no lag

RAWRity: yeah, 4chan loves them some crips
So the newsletters may be slow?

13dinobot defected because two moons meant they weren't on earth like megs said
If I landed a proper job, I'd be on cloud nine.
13then season 1 happened, the second moon blew up, and now they know they're on earth
/me laughs watching at TheRainbowDash and alexxm :)
interesting
dat voice O_o
One of the moons wasn't really a moon.
still no indiginous life forms though ;)
Æ
13sillions of years before the autobot-decepticon war started
Ø
Å
GDI
there, alphabet done.
Kandarihu: a moon is a natural satelite
Shizuka: How much is a sillion?
13but we'll get there
13no u
13xD
so i think it was a moon
13TheRainbowDash: it's slightly more than a quadzillion
That moment your internet decides to derp
Yes. The other one wasn't natural.
hey, the alphabet goes A-ZÆØÅ
Shizuka: Alright then...:D
oh man, the Fuzors...
oahi ZetaMetroidBrony didn't see you there
even a first-grader knows that
Im sorry but that was the most unconvincing transformation I'v ever seen
13Sure, except we don't use those letters here :P
Wazzpinator.
All the transformers based their beast forms on DNA of indigenous life forms.
so, the decepticons built installations in the shape of the lines that mark earths stellar position
CCCP It's OmegaMetroidBrony it's just that my internet derped and kept my other nick in chat
Fuzors and Transmetals
any special reason?
TheRainbowDash: u surprised me i was expecting a "ponf" when i kissed u but u didn't have nothing!
pff
In terms of marketing, it's a great gimmick. Two Toys in one, why wouldn't parents buy them?
dat southern accent
he said fuckers?
ZetaMetroidBrony: ok okay!
pablez94: Oops, sorry, was heating up my snack. *pomf*:D
Dken2021: see:AppleJack

Sidewinder is evil AppleJack?
you can gas robots?
Waspinator gets ALL the abuse....
Ninja'd!
otakon and that's why gmail is better
i'm able to make chat crash!!!! woah!!! (why?????????????????????????????)
Wait a minute. Was Sidewinder voiced by Ashleigh Ball?
Waspinator lives for abuse
dat execution
fail
Dken2021: I don't HAVE Gmail and I don't feel like makeing 3 dozen new accounts for it
13remember that dinobot stole both golden discs a couple eps ago
TheRainbowDash: :D
RX-78-SweetieBot: sounds like Otakon
Only the communist Russian alphabet has thos
e
both?
INSTEAD OF HEARING HIM KILL HIM
there
Dinobot just KILL HIM!
S two?
betreyal, again
Wow, he has no credibility.
Otakon lives for the shipping and lag.
and then he pulled the Starscream card
:D
oh Silverbolt... you and your honor
otakon x lag
I think Dinobot isn't really on their side
I think he's being a spy
otakon: get gmail or hotmail
http://i.imgur.com/Z0Xkf.jpg Oh my.
Dinobot has usually been straight-up. He doesn't like the Mammals, but would rather cooperate with them.
Dat flattery
cachi01: BESIDES MAKING 3 DOZEN NEW ACCOUNTS FOR A NEW EMAIL!

oh okay
Welcome, pony_834579

13except that won't nickalert me >w>

alexxm: ya i know
pony_834579 we got a kickbot, it does that when lines have been sent qucikly, but it's still wonky
It is actually 6 messages in less than 30 seconds, technically.:D (Captain Technical)

there's somebody from Argentina? :D
06Yeah lets call her Æ ~
It happened to me too, once.

haha, it's ok.. from where are you?
14ò.ò
there's the occasional line or phrasing that shows it's an amateur work, but most of it was really well written, and som fantastic character writing.
pony_834579: I'm from Baltimare.:D
TheRainbowDash: btw is that a classic toast? ham and cheese? can i have a piece of?

Shizuka: rather, its gold, and if it what you say it is, it is just gold, not like there is more gold on the planet or something :)
alexxm: wait a sec beer and pizza or beer pizza?
CCCP: Wow, how could I not see that coming?:|
beer pizza is delicious
RyunosukeKnT: it has nothing to do with it being gold,but with the information recorded on it

13the show that had to remove dot giving enzo a birthday kiss cause the censors were afraid people would think it was incest
and this is why Reboot is F@!KING AWESOME!
Shizuka: WHAT!?
13true story
everytime daribot posts something I look at this channel only to be dissapointed
Shizuka: that is STUPID
LMAO!!
i know but it's not that great to joke about the fact that u can't fly...
serriously Shizuka
so STUIPID
http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/pokmon-waste-of-a-move-slot.jpg
13season three is so much better than 1 and 2 cause they didn't have ABC's censors to answer to anymore
Shizuka: dafuq?

Shizuka: the HELL that is insane

"Forbidding all episodes being closed on cliff-hangers, to prevent younger children in the audience having 'traumatic tension'." WUT?!
That is legit
Captain Capacitor!
also, PIRATES!
They are going to use a torrent to escape?

YESH

If he already owns it, getting it off the internet is legal.
Did Rhinobot say?
Right?
oh not, Tigertron and Airazor!
...wait is this in the same world as transformers <.<
Hehehe
13plot point, the preds are building comm jammers because the planet buster stabilized all the energon
crush, kill, destroy, SWAG
13there's no longer energon interference
13or at least not as much as there was in season 1
star wars mlp crossover
sort of
hahahahahahahah http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4403/
/me noms on his fresh bread with peanut butter and apple butter.
But what is dis?
special snowflake syndrome: A malady affecting a significant portion of the world's population wherein the afflicted will demand special treatment, conduct themselves with a ludicrous, unfounded sense of entitlement, and generally make the lives of everyone around them that much more miserable.The danger of this disease is that the sufferers rarely, if ever, know that they have contracted...
...it, and continue about their merry way under the assumption that EVERYONE ELSE is the problem.
	This condition, if left untreated, can radically alter the carrier's demeanor, to include any of the following: a complete devolution to child-like behavior, temper tantrums, and/or fits of narcissistic rage.
Shizuka: nice so no more overloading as much right?
crap
Ok, that's creepy.
wrong window
13yep not as much
they can also stay in robot form longer
sorry guys
Lawlz: beast wars.
13plus the transmetals are immune now
Beast Wars...
13so in general everyone stays in bot mode longer
I want Go-bots, damn it!
suddenly motorcycle
12!pokemon
Why do robots OR spiders have breasts?
13fun fact, a couple eps from now rhinox will come out of beast mode, it's the last time he's ever seen on screen in it
ok i still have headaches thx to zelda and now i have 2 other series to worry about
Dat queen
12with aether eh
lol
casualy watching kids react
Megatron is best Queen
Lawlz: because fanservice
:P
cachi01: why a zelda headache? looking at the timeline again?
YES
How can a robot get choked
did you preorder gw2 yet?
freaky flower
I brought it for myself
played in the beta
WallDives: its just so hard to understand!
kk
Very_Silly_Filly: yet they can survive with their heads blown clean off
So sososos good
>__<
WHAT IS THAT MISTFIRE WOLF!
oh god the giant plant one
Shizuka loving that wiki page. All those jabs at the censors. :D
Very_Silly_Filly: must be some vital power conduits in his neck.
Have you sir?
not yet :P
13ikr
cachi01: but there is already a canon timeline. So...
its a cartoon, dont try to find logic in it
I didnt get the digital edition
/me hears his name pinged
cant decide if i should get it or not :(
I mean
The extra edition
WallDives: THE CANON TIMELINE IS WHAT GIVES ME HEADACHES
ALOHA EVERYONE
I dunno, probs a lame elite
hi wind!
Slag = poo?
cachi01: which one? there's 3.
Slag = whore
It probs summons a pet to use
WallDives: exactly
Midnight_Tempest: it's a low end Socratic exercise it needs SOME kind of consistancy
The only thing giving me headaches right now... is my dirty glasses.
Canon timeline? Are we talking about Detective Conan?
WallDives: we thought there was nly 2 timelines
oh god i cant think straight i dont know which way is up or down
but THERE ARE 3
yeah I don't trust thsoe plants
cachi01: just because its there, doesnt mean it has to make sense. And no, WindWhistler.
oh god
Because apparently only a year or so has passed in the two decades it's been around
The Zelda timeline is an idiotic construct by lazy devs who want to pretend they designed their games to tie together when they clearly never did.
inb4 ded
the failure, the kid, and the adult
metal eating plants?
I mean the series
what?
otakon: it does but when you try to apply human logic to robot logic, it just doesnt cross properly
Taking it as any sort of "canon" is nonsense.
oh that shipping
i just put my headphones and passed out
Mfw it loads up the stream and it says "Slag"
'dat ponyshrug
Best ship
CRAP!
OMG THEY'RE A COUPLE
13welp, been nice knowing you two, NOW GET ON THE BUS
TENTACLE ROBOT RAPE!
well
CK|Werk: or its just miyamoto being miyamoto
thats how dizzy i am
and this is the last we will see of them
I see where this is going
CRUSH, KILL, DESTROY, SLAG
rape time
to quote vivi... "Hot robot sex"
RAAAIIIP
lool slag
I think you guys have seen enough hentai
someone on youtube says its a mount
sry but otakon x tentacle monster
:/
Miyahon has nothing to do with the timeline...
Robots are machines. Technically, they should have a lot more logic than humans. But they are sapient, so they have emotions too.
what is this
Sexy_S2_Luna_of_War: No, it's hot spider secks
wouldnt work with the elite skill then, tho
welp they're dead
:3
ohai meanwhile
this sucks

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
RX-78-SweetieBot: yeah then beam from outerspace

RyunosukeKnT: http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Reproduction
Was that the cheetah guy?

1,3NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Shizuka: How much ReBoot have I missed?

Sexy_S2_Luna_of_War: best site EVA

Animal Crossing comes out tomorrow for the 3DS
otakon x cachi01
WUT
WindWhistler: DOES IT!?
what is a homestock?
Oops, caps
Yup.
I dont have a 3DS..
WindWhistler neat, and hai
But appropirate I guess
Screw everything. Why does Shizuka always have to stream during raid night?
pyrocatboy: its not funny when u ship me :( lol
And tomorrow's my sister's birthday
Niiice
WindWhistler: WOWOW
TOMORROW?
That means I'll nab it ASAP
Yes.
I NEED MONEY
BTW this is the same sister I've been talking about
I've just blown all my money GETTING a 3DS
and MK7
Rats with wings?
mk7 for vita is already out no???
Its a webcomic
otakon x EVERYONE!
he's a piegon?
I got one on Friday
But i just like this music
I wont be getting a 3DS until the fall.
i was just listening to love is in bloom and when he landed it said lets get this party started lol
Spaaaaace.
(Im a bit out of date on the comic)
Though so far...the 3DS games haven't been all that great...
WindWhistler: kid icarus and mariiokart are eic
epic
and all I'm getting for the 3DS is virtues last reward.
Yeah, it's an amazing console, but it's game selection is one of the worst I've seen
"Censoring the characters from utilizing any guns, yet it was perfectly acceptable for Frisket to wield a bazooka, as he was a dog. "
Harvest Moon keeps crashing on me...Skylanders is only 3 hours and 30 minutes long...
Lol
to beat the game I mean
WindWhistler: but skylanders is skylanders
kirzstryfe: well that's a great help......goddammit
Whaaaat
:D
It made the NeoGeo game selection look good
And I heard Rayman 3D was a bust too
its a rayman 2 remake
cachi01: Wait, are you insulting Skylanders?!
another one....
RX-78-SweetieBot: Lol.
they appear to have CSI technology
WindWhistler: nope im saying its short
1,3it's not something related to our stuff otakon, not much I can do :(
big gun
Yeah, but the 3D features weren't that great
LOL
WindWhistler: i love spyro
lol
The depth perception was bad
uhh right
es
oh god i cant think straight and im not drunk or high
depth perception indeed sucked
Dat feedback
I've heard of short games...
uhhhh
'TIS A LIE!
how out of date?
but THREE HOURS!?
5 years?
That's WAAAAAY too short!
It usually takes me about a day to complete a short game
skylanders is three hours?
WindWhistler: Real time conflict: shogun empires?
dude 3 hours is what AC takes
FAILURE
Nope
Yesssss.
You can't beat Animal Crossing.
005772
at least for me

Micheal Bay fucks up everything D:
inb4 ALIENS image
1,3pablex94, no you can't, the stream is still running
its a test for the new Bronystate intermission

ACS13123: u liar
alexxm: great - :) I didnt have any deliveries today
micheal bay makes a wooden chair explode
Very_Silly_Filly: Yes :)

I'm now debating making a spamwich for dinner...
Ahh okay
Wasn't sure
cachi01 that made me laugh for no reason
lol
Spam is pretty gross, but I like it.
kirzstryfe: i'm pableZ94 btw
NC said it would be epic if the movie just had explosions for characters
Hi guys
I'd watch that kind a movie.
hi lol!
lali-ho lolol
About explosions
why does we have an intermission?
1,3whatever you are, you still get my meaning :p
lolol a test
pablez94: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNEEEEEEEE its streaming an intermission mission, so you can mission in the intermission and creates more missions for the intermission
also i just saw the avengers in 3d, def one of my top 10 movies
ACS13123: ?
project:operation:mission
I've been playing fallout for the last couple hours and learned something - Blind Deathclaws are NOT blind :'(
pablez94: Exactly
Cypresswolf: youdontsay.jpg
Haha!
ping me when the music changes to something from Rayman or Touhou.
kirzstryfe: Any intention of zombie beatings today? I recently spent like 3 hours pounding a WoW boss into the dirt and I could use the giggles.
Deathclaws are trolling you.
dat awkward moment when your mom thinks that .png means pornography
that's why misnomers exist Cypresswolf, to screw wiyh you
kirzstryfe: well u can't call the intermission "running streaming"
Well WindWhistler, that won't happen
LAWL
I love pngs.
kirzstryfe: btw.
How do you know?
I already seen/heard this earlier
Cypresswolf: Blind Deathclaws are worse imo
...........no Rayman or Touhou?
Nope, sorry
The_Browncoat: well... ther u are
inb4 the chat panics when the stream ends and i take great pleasure from that pani
c
B-b-b-but...Rayman has the perfect intermission music!
Just listen to Band Land!

The_Si: well... ther u are

Band Land...that was the best music I had ever heard...
yeah yeah, we get it Rayman is great... i dont really care...
/me slaps Midnight_Tempest
WindWhistler or mute the stream and listen on youtube, that works
^
Dken2021: ....I never thought of that. :o
/me laughs
Well whatever. I'm not gonna talk about Rayman anymore
Now I don't want to play anymore :(
nice mesh there
Now I'm gonna talk about TOUHOU
smooth jazz is smoooooooth
WindWhistler: theres better shumps.
/me flicks WindWhistler's nose
WallDives: ........................BLASPHEMY
/me slides across the floor

/me puts a bucket on WindWhistler's head.
Vent in that.
...just wanna confirm that everyone knows I'm joking right?
/me continues to slide across the floor
I wasnt.
Ah, HAPPY WORKER'S CELEBRATION! :D
No one ever admits they're butthurt if they're serious
/me thinks someone's gonna say "only ten minutes to ponies" soon
kirzstryfe: u sure i cannot post vid links? this is not a REAL streaming....
/me does a power slide all around the chat.
when does the newsletter go out usually?
Only ten minutes until NOTHING AT ALL.
/me places sandpaper in the middle of the chat
So, you can grind Audinos to L100?
around monday and tuesday
today RynunusukeKnT
kirzstryfe: it looks more like a countdown
andd how long does it take for one to get on the mailing list :)
Not real streaming, how silly.
its like im wearing nothing at all... nothing at all... NOTHING AT ALL!
In ten minutes the stream will self destruct. We're running out of time!
Midnight_Tempest: You're going to feel pain soon
Oh god Midnight_Tempest O_O
XD
not that long RyunosukeKnT
/me points to sandpaper in his way
hmm
his being Midnight_Tempest
Smooth jazz will play before the stream explodes
cool :D
just message someone like kirzstryfe to get on the mailing list
well, I'll be back later.
if I sent it out saturday or sunday should I be on it by today?
Alright, back everypony.:P
Maybe I should've laid a rug down...
/me slides across the sandpaper and bursts into flames.
later.
rug burns hurt more than sandpaper, right?
/me sips his coke
Hi TheRainbowDash! glomps
(has been glomped on)
welcome back TheRainbowDash
WindWhistler: yep
THE ZOMBIES HAVE ARRIVED confront now or later
hi TheRainbowDash
Having been rug burnt but not sandpapered I couldn't give you an accurate answer WindWhistler.
ok bronies tell me: is kirzstryfe ignoring me? or he's simply AFK?
i always give 100% at work.............. 20% monday 15%tuesday 25%wednesday 30thursdays and 10% fridays
kirzstryfe: You alive?
pablez94: May just be AFK.
hey TheRainbowDash what have you been up to
/me places porcupines in Midnight_Tempest's way
he's probably busy
honestly, rug burns only burn for a short time... sandpaper wounds effing HURT... losing several layers of skin is brutal
or he doesn't want to be bothered
alexxm: Nothing much, and you?
You can't slide over purcupines...
TheRainbowDash: wait a sec.... U BACK!!!!
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
not much TheRainbowDash
(Sorry won't be chatting much, got to study for finals)

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1860/
Shizuka, you should add some Rayman or Touhou music.
or maybe Kirby...
^
WindWhistler no one likes Rayman as much as you do.
Grape Gardens is good music
or PSO
Oh dear...
Hello Bronysith and Litwick!:)
Meanwhile: You forgot about Touhou
spyro R0CKZ

When they hear triumph sshout, Dragonborn for your blessing we pray.
Lawlz: predeccsor to Halo
so...whos streaming...i can never tell :$
When they hear triumph's shout,Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray,And the Scrolls have foretold,Of black wings in the cold,That when brothers wage war come unfurled,Alduin bane of kings,Ancient shadow unbound,With a hunger to swallow the world.
Those beeps are really screwing up my background gaming.
Stinky_Pinkie: yeah lol

Rainbow: Oh, hello, sorry won't be chatting frequently here, playing games and studying for my finals.:P
Cannon Fodder is the winner.
True.
For some reason, Ctrl+Alt+E is NOTHING.
I don't like liquorice.
OO MARATHON
So, I'm assuming heavy armor, with shields?
777
Neither do I
Lawlz: what about "already dead"
That I can agree on

I think liquorice is something you can only appreciate without tastebuds
I don't know
i saw someone playing this on my first movie night
Is this DOOM?
This looks really cool, I'm reading about it right now.
its marathon
Rainbow: Marathon

airplane
Some advice for you good people, never ever eat tuna plain while drinking lemonade.
mine was revenge of the nerds
See ya, everypony. Gotta go play TF2. Bye!
Rainbow: Not quite. It's a game made for Mac to capitalize on Doom's Popularity.
alexxm: starting up the first movie night convo are we? :P
...were those fairies?
i JUST joined bronystate after that
TWO HOURS LATER........Darn it, now you got me acting all that sappy?
I think my first was "the Time Traveler's Wife"

My first was Hot fuzz
Mine was three days ago.
Thats the date, not the movie.

What is this? Doom 2 looked better than this
im not really TRYING to play the main quest of skyrim.

Shane377, it most certainly is not
what is this
halo's big brother

But what makes me angry is the fact they arent asking me if I want a Mac Book Air
They just fucking assume I want it
oh ok
it looks pretty good if you ask me
hello Sumica how are you?
00,10I am well
also, SKYRIM DLC IS FINALLY COMING!

twilight_sprinkle: no mine is in november
Wait a second... the Main Character is a security officer on a Generation ship....

Why are bethesda games so buggy?

robotdragon7: just set it up dammit!
You know the weirdest glitch that happened ot me?

I wish I had a good enough PC to run Skyrim. :/
robotdragon7: ALL PS3's have wireless adapters built in
lol
I went outside of a house in Skyrim and I spawned in the ground
oh.....derp
wtf?
Sumica: what about the one with extra crew member?
You know what you can do with dragon skellitons?
robotdragon7: if your router runs on wirless, it'll work, otherwise just buy a 10 dollar CAT 5 cable and hook it to your router
Use a raise dead spell on the corpse
Ohai Wrek

Was Sumica the one streaming Burn Notice earlier today?
I hate it when I put items in my house and when I come back its all over the god damn floor
lmao!
Sumica: after getting it, i used the MG from collector ship exclusivly
Where did you get the episodes from?
im NEVER here when there is a dead space stream...that or there never IS ONE!
Any idea when the dlc for this comes out as GOTY
Thus ended the quest of Cannon Fodder the vegan emo pyro, who died after forgetting he was vegan and being murdered by debuffs after eating some cheese.
1,3I don't think anyone has streamed dead space here before
robotdragon7: there never is a DS stream
They need to
AND EET VAS GOOD!
I can see why
00,10Wrek did once kirzstryfe
Lawlz: that must have been an awkward death

It was indeed.
ANy idea when new vegas GOTY comes out?
Never. *evil laugh*

hi
LunaTheBorderlands what system do you play on?
Got distracted by crack...ed.com. What happened?
Xbox
Rage? Rage?! Get out. Right now.
sweet, we should play sometime
Monfang|lazy, I think 3000 is the limit for stories with multiple chapters. But they also got a limit for complete stories that is slightly lower.
lulz
We should
i miss the dart gun from fallout 3 :(
rage was goddamn big
But right now I have to go
Wait.... What?
also, RX-78-SweetieBot why is it such a deal that i am british?
fair enough
twilight_sprinkle, we had one of those last week
13 gb on xbox and 8 on ps3
I used the hunting rifle more than any other weapon in the entire game.
hope you have a great day/night
I would have to re-download all the DLC for borderlands...
I only have one chapter that is 2573 characters
Helping my parents buy a bew TV
And it was awesome.
Chrysalis: is isnt
Seeya LTB.
RainbowAsh: well last week nobody really followed the movie
it*
I'll be back on tonight
I tried to draw Green Hill this morning
Monfang|lazy, is the story complete?
I don't think I can get it up to 3000 without just rambling on and on.
NO
See you guys later
/me hugs LunaTheBorderlands.
/me kisses TheRainbowDash back and blocks the rising of her wing

/me hugs everypony
/me hugs LunaTheBorderlands
Really? A shovel?
pablez94: Man, I want my wings to raised now!:D
So, yesterday I read a story about Appledash using sex with a dead tree as a major plot point.
not sure if its better than "bitish guy with kinnect" or not
And it was really weird.
Lawlz, shouldn't that be for #Brony?
depends on if you consider kinect an insult or not
I have no idea.
I'm also British, so I think we outnumber RX-78-SweetieBot.
Lawlz: Oh yeah, heard about it, but never read it, good thing that I haven't yet....:S
=_(\
KICK ASS!!
Monfang|lazy, that's hard then. You could always send it in and ask them if they could make an exception.
You know what we need to stream?
Twilight
I AM MADE OF CHEESE!
Don't read it. ;_;
/me eats TheHoodyNinja
Sumica: sooo tempting, ME3 is on sale on origin, but a friend will kill me for supporting EA following the DLC fuss on release
GAH!
TheHoodyNinja: I am made of toast and Dashy powers
ducj tales, wohoo!
twilight_sprinkle, I definitely think so.
We should stream the Twilight Saga
YEAH NINJACHEESE
Oh well. I already got a lot of attention on FIMfiction. I'll update Chapter 1 then get to work on Chapter 2
But I have all the guns
RainbowAsh: ok cool
lawl
Ya'll want a linkw hen I'm done updating it?
And all the calories.
:3
I don't wanna watch it again
wait..again?
and none of the legallity to use them here
RainbowcrashNBurn: do you have a PS3? or Portal 2?
I've seen them before >.>
im not the only one seeing the buffering screen am i? o.o
And a silly haircut.
No, I have the guns because I am a gunsmith, not just because Im murrican.
00,10To each there own RainbowcrashNBurn
Monfang|lazy, you could bundle the first two chapters to get it on eqd, though
We should stream the E.T atari game then
lol
05oops cerashed
NONONONON
cachi01: watching what?
Hazard: i have an Xbox, and portal 2 on pc
goddammit!
that game no please
Dark_Horst: TWILIGHT
I tink I'll get it at least half way finished first, RainbowAsh. But thanks for the idea.
Oh shit i thought it was my net that caused the stream to stop xD
it looks like i can stay awake a bit more... something like 2 minutes... btw...
We should have an Amnesia stream.
/me removes his hoof form TheRainbowDash 's wings
I was about to rage
otakon you can't say "goddamnit" unless you get falcon kicked.
Monfang|lazy, you're welcome. ^^

It annoys me the megaman 9 demo ends right as you enter the boss room

I'm going to stick my quantum harmonizer in your photonic resonation chamber.
pablez94: Oh well then...
He knew the quote!
Or he hates me. :/

What a terrible night to have a curse
Can you sing "Love is in Bloom?"
ey man, wanna buy a watch?
Wrek: just give yourself max credits

how do you only have 45=
Hazard: yeh ok, not very good at the co-op mode though :D
Dark_Horst: he spends a LOT of caps
Wrek is poor, and has more stuff than I've ever seen in the entire world.
Wrek: They would intentionally raise the prices, just for you to make you mad.:D (lower them for anybody else)
RainbowcrashNBurn: no prob :D
How I earned my caps in NV. Go into the energy weapon shop, steal everything, sell it. ????. Profit.

otakon is rolling because he needs to lay off the burgers.
Dark_Horst: ALWAYS
STEAL EVERYTHING
Meanwhile: I'll roll you!
I think I have all the weapons its possible to get in New Vegas
RainbowcrashNBurn: my Steam is Cheeze|Jizz|(Destructmon) or if that doesnt work just Destructmon

Deathclaws are piss easy when they have their legs broken
Wrek: you are dead meat
Man, all the people on the NSFW chat suck.

what do you mean RX-78-SweetieBot
which addon is this?
alexxm: never mind, bad joke
Nothing to loot here.jetpac
Single Deathclaw=doable
otakon: want to know my answer?
Multiple Deathclaws=RUN!
GRENADE AND MINE SPAM
otakon: Deathclaw Matriarch is best Deathclaw.
I don't think it's against the rules to mention NSFW things, as long as we don't link to them.
Blind Deathclaws are usually in groups, shoot one, and they all come after u
Meanwhile: from Fallout 1?
Blind my ass
What about multiple Cazadors otakon?
otakon: Did you not find that one in NV?
Lawlz: eh try not to
Read the rules, and then you will know for sure.
I did.
Meanwhile: oh, in thw Quarry yeah

If a deathclaw sees you before you've killed them all, you're doing it wrong

I still love it to death, and play it occasionally

02Me neither. ye- ^
so I kind accepted the fact I wont be able to 1cc the games
/me rolls tumbleweed through chat

Hi Ryanier128
hi Ryanier128
it took me three months to 1cc EoSD, and I just recently found out I somehow had the max-life set
02Well, isn't that like something that would rather motivate you? .-.
so it wasn't even a legit 1cc
not really
I like figuring things out
Hey
but not when I need to clear through ALL of the stages beforehand
Red flare looks op, but the damage seemed a bit underwhelming, might be due to difficulty setting though (guessing its very hard?)
02True dat
Krakass!
so like i said
I don't have the time to do that
02Also. 1cc EoDS
I just play to enjoy
Anybody here ever played Legendary?
it is a hard DLC
the only time I try seriously is when I play extra modes
02Or 'semi-legal' 1cc.
02HOW.
derp
DAM ITTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\
I DIED

Because you can find laser guns in puddles of goo

That is.......amazing.
ninjaxmas: Ok, now you must learn how to use everything as a weapon, grab anybody here but me and beat up Biglaw with them
thats a mod
Whaat? Why?
Biglaw: hey, you can find perfectly good, uncooked meat in piles of ash :P
I'm sorry, I don't play fallout
RainbowcrashNBurn: and dont forget mini-guns inside brains
/me grabs MahBoi777 and beats Biglaw to death with him

what game is this?
fallout- new vegas Rarity-Indeed
/me slaps ninjaxmas for killing people
oh cool
Shamroc: i havent played far through enough to see something like that :P
Biglaw: those puddles of goo are all thats left of someone that got deintegrated by a plasma grenade
ninjaxmas I do not think that is appropriate for the chat
yea
http://i.imgur.com/u7Fc6.jpg
02Like, really.
ok see
furthest i got in new vegas is the town near the space station where the ghouls take the rocket
/me Throws Invi|zombiefied into the manticore pit for slapping his pupil
RainbowcrashNBurn: was reffering to something that happend yesterdy... Wrek found a good assult rifle in a very small portion of somebodys brain

Shamroc: ah, must of missed that bit :P

02Everyone does, lol
let me reiterate

/me slaps TheHoodyNinja
I gotta go, gents.
C ya Phrostphyre :)
Bye Phrostphyre
oh bah Phrostphyre
I got into that game immediately, played it first because of chronological order (didn't realize it was the hardest), and didn't play any of the other games
not to mention, I played that game rather often
/me eats Invi|zombiefied's hand
sit
uhh
Okay everypony, go to this site and type in "Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Enter" http://railslove.com/
I could probably 1cc it legitly, I actually got very close the other night (after not playing touhou for months)
I just can't be bothered
:)
Biglaw...funny ive done the before on other sites
http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/2011/06/lulzsec-lulz.jpg
ninjaxmas: Now you must beat Tloz: OoT without collecting any heart containers
If you do a parading pinkie will show up
Wrek what is the biggest gun you can get?
...any thing over the shoulder Invi|zombiefied
0_0 EXPLOSION\
oh, niice
:O dat explosion

TheHoodyNinja: ha i did that three days ago your lessons are becoming quite easy sensei
where'd you get that funky laser pistol?
Michael Bay would've been proud
and where can i buy one?
damnit ninjaxmas your supposed to wait >(
It ain't a Big F*cking Gun 9000!
hai everybody!
i think i enjoy the game more in hardcore, encourages you to craft stuff more i feel, particlualry food
http://bronies.memebase.com?p=114931 dat feeling :)
Okay then, you want hard, youll get it
wait RX-78-SweetieBot what is preventing YOU from telling me?
hello
hi EpicPwnTime
Invi|zombiefied: i'd say fatman. it shoots nuclear bombs
hi ryanier1208
TheHoodyNinja: haha i did that without even knowing it would aid in my training
Cause I dont feel like making up a silly reason right now XD
It looks kinda like Deckard's gun.(Blade Runner)
Dark_Horst nice
Invi|zombiefied: there'sa version of it called experimental mirv. it fires 6 at once
ormaybe it's just me
vaporizes EVERYTING
including you
02<Aurora> I just can't be bothered <- Ahw; well. That's quite a shame :\
mirv. ?
you cripple
mirv
ninjaxmas, your next mission is to beat me in a game of Yu-Gi-Oh while simultaneously reciting the alphabet over and over again while swordfighting me
/me wasn't vaporized or crippled
..hmph
OMG I FOUND GOLD NO KIDDING
nice!
Ryanier128 but it is able to do so
THREE PEICES
/me is vaporized
Wrek: you did find the experimental mirv?

dammit!
IM SOOOO HAPPY
what game is this
***Fail
Let's do the shuffle!
whatever it is, it looks AWESOME!!!
/me Swordfights TheHoodyNinja while reciting the alphabet and narrowly beating him at a game of Yu-Gi-Oh
Fallout: New Vegas
fallout is epic!!!!
Apperently my dad thinks other computers besides the Macbook Air are garbage
ninjaxmas: Very good, your skills are improving, next time i will have to use my Egyptian god card
maybe you should consider VATS from time to time
I said do you want a computer that will last or a piece of garbage that puts up
*he
my leeeeeg
they seem very tough guys
Freaking apple inthusiast
wow... it worked
yaaay
VATS is for people who cant shoot.
*cue Wilhelm's Scream*
^
!pokemon
nooo i hate spiders
TheHoodyNinja how many more sessions untill my training is over sensei
What dlc?
lol i just came back from watchimg videogame legends!!!!!
Is it true macs cant play games?
you would think the house would collapse after that many explosions
have u heard of pokemon creepy black?
RX-78-SweetieBot: VATS is for people who want tosee awesome cose up splatter in slow mo
ninjaxmas: Hell i dont know i just make this crap up as i go along
any Apple technology hates me
perhaps he should put the gun away before he misfires
I picked up and iPad 3 and it burst into flames
Id rather just kill them quickly and get it over with.
Can they actually play games like WoW or Half life decently
RX-78-SweetieBot: saying vats is for people who cant shoot is rather stupid
I'm getting tired. Night everypony.
seeya ZappyTheUnicorn
nighty ZappyTheUnicorn
fine, VATS is for wimps.
night Zappy
RX-78-SweetieBot: becasue if you hit or not is determined mostly by how many skillpoints you have in the weapon category in fallout
Apperently my dad wants to get me this http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air/select
Night Invi|zombiefied, Ryanier128, and TheHoodyNinja. :)
the thing costs about 1000 dollars
RX-78-SweetieBot: have youn actually played the game?
no, in new vegas you just need to hit them. your skill in the weapon category is for how much damage they do
/me becomes a master ninja!!! he is awarded with the Sword of Mignot a powerfull sword that harnesses the power of thunder
i got 10 peices of redstone
!pokemon
Ok ninjaxmas, calm down, one final task before your training can be complete
awwww
/me throws a boomerang at ninjaxmas
Besides I want a comp with decent memory storage
hahaha
/me intercepts Boomerang with ninja star
the one that is going for 1600 dollars only has 256 GB memory
/me throws kunai at Ryanier128
/me throws the cheese at ninjaxmas.
Dark_Horst: Yes, I have. I have done EVERYTHING in it on at least normal
ninjaxmas: Your final task is to go to McDonalds, order something, and then walk into the restaraunt and throw it back in the cashiers face, and record it for my amusement
I can get a computer with 1TB memory for way less
http://comixed.membase.com?p=34177 This is funneh :3
/me 's boomerang bounces off the ninja star AND the kunai and continues it's flight towards ninjaxmas
Ricochet, man
Biglaw: dat link fail
/me cuts pyrocatboy 's cheese into shredded cheese
awww
/me eats Ryanier128's boomerang and then spits it back at Ryanier128
256 GB memory for 1,600 sounds like a terrible deal
13http://i.imgur.com/6b675.gif
lol
twilight looks SMASHING
Shizuka lol
/me Records himself ordering a big mac and throwing it at the casheirs face
http://comixed.memebase.com?p=34177 I fixed the link :D
ninjaxmas.: Thank you! -eats the cheese-
oh god
Goodjob ninjaxmas
/me 's arm turns into a biomechanical boomerang throwing arm. HIs boomerang knocks out the first boomerang at supersonic speeds and continues it's flight path with 2 other boomerangs following it and a 4th on it's way
Flare is bored.
BTD5 guys
Hiya FlareChaser how are you?
/me gives ninjaxmas the ceremonial ninja master hoody
Boomerangs vs. Ninjas
Biglaw: Good, good.
Ryanier128 ninjas
/me stands still as Ryanier128
fuck
I wish my parents let me decide what computer I wanted
so many joins and quits by LC
/me stands still as Ryanier128's boomerangs bounce off of him
/me lolz at TheHoodyNinja's fail
TheHoodyNinja have you ever even heard of Bloons Tower Defense?
what should i call my new character in new vegas?
vegie
Ryanier128: Played the shit out of it, why?
/me takes the hoody and thanks TheHoodyNinja for being an epic teacher
They want to buy me a Macbook Air it costs from 1000 dollars to 1600 depending on the size of it
twilight_sprinkle: I doubt the Macbook air can actually play games on it well enough
/me can't decide if he should be happy for TheHoodyNinja or totally pissed off at him
/me remembers he is a brony
Well I told him that and you know what he said?
/me cuts Ryanier128 in half with a katana for throwing boomerang at him
He said do you want a computer that will last(the macbook) or a piece of garbage that will put out
D:
/me rubs hoodedxmasninja's head playfully "Now stop that, thats not nice"
hoodedxmasninja you don't get my references do you?
Like a boss
!pokemon

Invi|zombiefied: theyre the ones buying it

Invi|zombiefied: theyre in charge of the money, they have the overruling vote, what can he do

Covered in blood and puke and bits of skull fragment.
Allo everypony.

rose-colored glasses
im out for now be back l8ter bye everypony
twilight_sprinkle ya, that's right. but who cares what they think if you have the free choice ^^
I want something that can run well and actually play games
i have a friend who has a mac, and he plays all his games through windows
RainbowcrashNBurn : Yes, or Linux, BSD, etc.
Pff... Like Im going to get a say in what I want
Kaboom
life is complete http://cs11224.userapi.com/u12816927/-14/z_8a13a548.jpg
RainbowcrashNBurn: yeah what sucks about macs is their OS
I'm 15-16 with no money or a job how am I going to get it custom built
oooor get an alienware
What sorta food would ponies have for breakfast?
Bronysith : I think he wanted a laptop. That's more tricky.
Im looking at the OS for the Air and it looks crap
cachi01: the main thing i dont like about macs, is their obsession with having the weirdest mice imaginable
Maybe.. Oatmeal?
ehm: ooh
ehm: gaming laptop
03Nothing like sleeping in until 7pm, eh?
ehm: never heard of such witchraft
dunno
i wonder what apple uses instead of Excel
Something called OS X Lion
It looks crap
Sounds cooler.
twilight_sprinkle: pie they use pie
Bronysith: Oo
twilight_sprinkle : well, anyone can use LibreOffice
twilight_sprinkle: macs can use microsoft office, but i think they also have own version
macs arent good for gaming
If I had to pick blindly between Excel and OS X Lion, I'd pick the Lion.
10Nothing like running the treadmill at 7pm, eh?
well, sh*t
If its going to be my comp and I want to get games for it I dont want a mac
WHAT THE HELL HOW U DIE Wrek radiation or zapped to death

Bronysith: is the sith lord on equestria or the jedi?
Rainbow: I dont mind some of it, I just hate the MLP part. unless its human MLP, im fine with that.
RainbowcrashNBurn: Blast Hardcheese
Shamroc: Because God hates you.
Rainbow: well i think its a funny rule but thats about all

Bai everypony.

Bye everypony I'm going to equestriadaily
ehm: ty for advice, but im gonna wait till i get a new gfx card as well, upgrade both at same time
Bronysith: you're*
Bronysith I did read the prologue. I skipped the disclaimer.
Biglaw: that fast
I'm going to be relaxing on some pony TF2 servers. But if anyone knows of some good 'Ditzy Doo in a dress' pictures, I need some ideas of what Rarity might make for her.
Biglaw: damn it felt like it took forever to write that
Send me an IM with them. KTHXBYE
kirzstryfe: ready
I tried to draw Green Hill zone today
Bronysith I'm a fast reader, I could read MLD in 40 minutes tops

this team building class is not going to be fun
wait wat Meanwhile
I do like the Mario Galaxy Cd I got
although it might become more manageable once spring classes end
Bronysith: You could do with checking your "your/you're"s, you should space the text in a way that's easier to read and the dialogue comes across as rushed.
Exactly
Dead

13LOL
Wrek: WHY are you as perceptive as a blind dog?
I'm getting a "legend of the dogman" vibe from this robot.
alexxm: I have no idea exactly what it is you've shown me, but I like it.
13going by yourself cuz you have no friends to go with :D
/me runs
I have to ask about that
Knuckles knew Robotnik was the badguy in SA but he still fell for his trick
otakon: because the rats are coming
hell ehm if i rember correctly robticnick had preaty much allready won there
Is knuckles just retarded?
RX-78-SweetieBot: NOT THE RATS!

Wrek: YOU WILL DIE RUN AWAY NOW!
ehm: well he clearly knew robotnik was a badguy is Sonic adventure

otakon: i was referencing the You are a Pirate song
WAASSSUUUPPP!
12Stuck with us lot?
CCCP: oh

hi icybeauti!!!!!!!!!! :D
12and pfft
12I have friends
12blp duh
hey icybeauti hows your day been
And the best advice you may ever get...
why does the music randomly start like that when entering combat?
Hello CCCP and alexxm. My day had been well.
Beast? Why kill am X-Man?
LYYYRRRAA YOUR GOING TO GET YOURSELF KILLED
RainbowcrashNBurn: ED-E does that...ALOT
an*
is don't go out at night.
Xmen rule
Never liked that guy.
you recken you'll read much of the SCP stuff Meanwhile
90's X-men cartoon is best cartoon.
Well
Wrek is STILL streaming, guess true bronies don't need sleap.
Also I did a massive facepalm when i discovered something in the Death eggrobo fight in Sonic Generations
and back stupid damn usb adapte
Best X-men cartoon
Meanwhile: Yiu mean evolutions?
okay brb checking my ME3
/me bonks icybeauti in the head with a cinderblock.
Meanwhile: What?
ima go eat be back in like 10 mins
alexxm: dunno, perusing it as we speak.
When he shoots his arm into the ground and pulls it out his leg goes up..apperently you can spindash under it
/me passes out from cinderblock
wow, 521 total ammo
and you can get behind it when the robot turns around after you hit it
:D
no Soital
in class
im going to make iron ore
sorry if i offended anyone
blow up ALL the warheads!
They need to remake all the sonic bosses for Generations
That still fallout 4?
i mean goold ingots
3
And the best advice you may ever get...... is to not go out at night.... -howls-
no sign of a victory pack yet for me otakon
I really wanted to fight the final boss of Sonic and Knuckles in 3d
ED-E carries a ton in stuff, floats like a feather
that robot was gigantic
pyrocatboy: Also, DONT GO IN MAI SHED!
12LOL
12no worries
12was only teasing
I have wonder...robotnik was still in the death egg robo when it was defeated right?
i wonder if theres ever gonna be proper levels in DLC for generations
How did he survive the station blowing up?
Also Sonic 2 XL is the best hack ever
Robotnik is made of dark matter
icybeauti: Wanna hear a cool song?
aww
ded
pyrocatboy: Sure
lol
Dat hole in the ground.
That writing on that trailer is ominus
man, just got on and need to leave again.
HE WAS ALMOST DEAD YOU WUSS
haven't played this DLC yet
that was close :O
/me is in a rage
What DLC is it?
oh bethesda you and your wonky physics
ded
Oh god
My little skyrim...
so is wrek addicted to psycho or something?
Wrek you have how many tripmines exactly?
aww forgot I got hw to finish, bye everypony :|
At least they arent Cazadors
:P
just saying
between the two whos the actual good guy? Mr house or the NCR?
cya Scootaloo_94 good luck
i never been stuck in class till 9PM before
how do you cure addictions to the items and stuff?
RainbowcrashNBurn: Get a therapist
I assume these are dlc weapons?
not having them i think RainbowcrashNBurn
You talk to a doctor and he cures you for a price
Douchebag
NCR has good people in it, but its government is horribly inefficant and corrupt. Mr. House just wants control of Vegas and the area around it. neither it really good or bad
Screw both of them, take Vegas yourself.
how does a robot go unconsious?
So because I have the desire to always be on the side of good, who should I side with?
malfunction BigLaw
FATALITY
success!
malfunction Biglaw
That deathclaw's head esploded
Haha! The Biglaw has been doubled!
For realz?
Mmhmm
I wish I knew why I have this obsession to always be good
I always feel bad when I act evil
Wrek: I TOLD YOU DAMMIT!
and ded
Deathclaws are SNEAKY!
don't see the reason, altough never knew him really well
Not as sneaky as Fel Reavers.
otakon: how are such huge things sneaky as a ninja
Meanwhile: Bear Reaver
what are deathclaws mutated from
Or as nijas. Ther can be one behind you right now
alexxm: Jackson Chameleon's
and ded
What the fuck are death claws supposed to be?
Cornered butt fun
I mean what did they mutate from?
He was just kind of a douche.
Omega: dogs :D
I JUST SAID IT THREE TIMES LISTEN DAMMIT!
otakon x Jackson Chameleons
JACKSON CHAMELEONS
otakon x everything that moves
Holy crap, there are so many MLP fan games in developement... with professional quality
/me facepalms
Wrek: you won't be able to run, just RETREAT for now!
I am really looking forward to Fighting is Magic and My Little Investigations
Lambo what are those
How the fuck does http://derpy.me/HRjLu TURN INTO THIS http://images.wikia.com/fallout/images/1/18/FNV_DeatclawAlpha.png
I know fighting is magic
and ED-E is dead
Cayan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cC5v--qzXnw
Some of the other mutations look possible
whats the second one Lambo i haven't heard of it
Wrek: you can't without more/better gear
That thing from a lizard is insane
Wrek: why the fuck did you think this was a good idea?
Wait..what
WUT
Evening people =O
hiya Airpuff
and nommed
and ded
in 3
2
Why the hell did the government think this was a good idea to create?
Wrek having problems? xD
I ask again. Is this Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas?
Its like the pirates trying to control metroids
Kandarihu: it's New Vegas
God, watching too many PMVs
Does anyone know of this DLC
I still dont see how those things used to be lizards
Thanks. Sorry for getting irritable
Everypony! I am going to play Ponymon!
Hi people!
they dont look ANYTHING LIKE ONE
Hi Gir!
hey Gir hows your day been
Hi Gir =)
icybeauti: What did you think of the song?
otakon: Killed the Dragon Priest at the end of the archmage of winterhold questline at level 6 using lightning and a steel sword.
Good alexxm
While wearing robes.
what is that
pyrocatboy: Pretty good
how'd you manage that Meanwhile
Meanwhile: yfw the game still SCALES to you to a degree
Meanwhile: want to know a ammusing physics glitch?
THIS does NOT scale to low levels
Watching TFOP
GUYS, How many songs does Dashie sing by herself or duet? Only one i can think of is May The Best Pet Win...
Wrek: it's a TRAP!
otakon: Yfw that dragon priest killed me in 2 hits like 70 times.
Meanwhile: use a raise dead spell on a dragon skelliton.. it goes flying
Does this game also take place 200 years after China nuked the U.S.?
u.s deserved it
I may have forgotton but what was Sentinel Prime built for?
xD
Meanwhile: yeah, but Wrek has EVERYTHING crippled and no hard hitting weapons
veintan
veintam
theres her bit in at the gala Gunthler
otakon: All you need is a sword and lightning bolt.
Kandarihu: new vegas takes place a couple years after fallout 3
Meanwhile: he's already has every disadvantage I can think of atm
Meanwhile: LIGHTNING BOLT! *chucks cardboard*
veintam started cuz of comunisom
lol
scootminer: according to the alternate history, the Vietnam war never happened.
alexxm: Yeah, but thats with all of the Mane 6 tho... I just want only Dashie by herself or a duet...
Wrek: don't forget to sell your crap in MISC!
Squee! I can't wait to play ponymon :D
Why was Sentinel prime built?
/me hits b
When was he supposed ot be done?
i thought it would count Gunthler
Omega cinderblock sounds like a cinderblock designed to end life as we know it.
yes
Mandows...
When was he actually finished?
/me tickles TheRainbowDash
kill it with FIRE!
MANDOWS
zS
Besides. We had a good reason to go to war in Vietnam. It was wrong to draft soldiers, and we were hit by a massive propaganda attack towards the end of the war which is why we were so villified.
alexxm: Hahaha, that tickles!:D
KILL THEM WITH FIRE!
Cool story, but it needs more mandows
In the event of catastophic failure of planetary life forms, engage the omega cinderblock and prepare for returning of the planet into prime elements.
icy, no.
the veintam the iran and some other war was started by amarica and same cause comunisum
Kill me with fire
Hey Wrek. Take a look in the chat.
Wrek: you can fast travel BACK to the entrance of the Lonesome Road!
it was supposed to be ready in 2077
Litwick: I know you hate mandows. LOVE AND TOLERATE!
/me sets Gir on fire
it was finished 200 years later
you don't HAVE to go the long way!
YAAAAAAAAAAAY~ IT BURNS
So could you please not be so bigoted about a country that some people in this country live in and actually appreciate?
/me facepalms
the tech Prime had was impressive for when it was built
It chucked nukes like footballs
damn you typos
the other war wascuba also caused by amarica and comunisum
LOL
otakon x WER
im a amrican i dont like amrica much
I was sad when Liberty prime sacrificed himself
Kandarihu: you are asking way too much of random people on the internet
He died for our sins
are you talking about korea
... I truly have NO idea what you guys are talking about o.o
i like the conditoiinds but the behaivor err.... no
inb4 deathclaws teaming up with bears
The blur when your head is crippled pisses me off
alexxm: everything is worse with bears
:P
Why cant we take ED-E with us?
Well, communist propaganda is everywhere nowadays, and we're kind of on the brink of it happening on a global scale. Please pardon me if I'm at least a little nervous about the death of freedom.
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
WHY did you try to play Hardcore Lonesome Road?
hello Scoot-Scootaloo
brb guys
00,03Oh good evening, everyone!

00,03Eh, went to class, got light headed, fell asleep, dreamed of North Korea, woke up, and logged on here!
Dem uses for legs.

The answer is that it is global.
%Scoot-Scootalooo Sounds like you had a fun day!
Kandarihu: idiots are everywhere, so global
Useful idiots
%Scoot-Scootaloo: o.o wow.. sounds like quite the day xDD
its some mythical yao guai
Kandarihu: Yes. Today here in New York, they blocked all the major bridges and tunnels in downtown Manhattten

!roara
Aurora sit!
/me sits

They did it while everyone was at work, right?
I'm back again, everypony!
Kandarihu: Yeah. Now there are a bunch of delays across downtown and stuff
00,03Oh hai, Dark92Enigma!
hey Dark92Enigma what you been up to
=O he's not playing anymore? =c
Wrek: can i add you to steam before you dissapear?

GIRRRRRR
Just came back from dinner......chinese food, to be precise.....
*hugs gir*
Dark92Enigma: I had pizza
Chinese food. Omnomnom.
All all the Super Mutants male or were there any females?
*Are
yay Gir *nom on cookie*
Dark92Enigma: I.. Am.. Not.. Jealous!!!!
You know, the first amendment guarantees the right to peaceful assembly. But shutting down bridges, tunnels, and roads are not things that peaceful assemblies do.
brb
k gir
Airpuff why you would be??? Oh, the chinese food, right?
mhm ._.
Im sort of glad the Giant Super mutants arent in this game
dat buffer
/me gives Aurora a treat
so Wrek's stream is done?
jeez, is everyone have internet troubles today?
hello, everyone :)
:>
Can someone explain the whole catchign the boque thing to me?
including me....
Whats so special about it?
Hai :>
hey QT_Marks hows your day been
good thanks!
Hello QT_Marks
Yeah, don't bother answering my question.
Litwick: it is
is the stream down or is it just on my end?
hhhhiiiii
oh, ok. I thought my internet was being a butt.
For now x)
I feel my pride is hurt due to the fact I lost to a fucking Blissy
you just missed it QT_Marks
How are you?
alright
Blissy? pokemon right?
OK.....i bet everypony is sick and tired of hearing this but........Did TwiilightSparkle came here earlier? today's her birthday..........OK, i'll shut up
I have a ton of stuff i'm trying to get done in the next couple weeks
bye ppl
666?
I'm taking a break right now
ahh lol, just making sure
Yes.
Ah
not that i'm aware of Dark92Enigma
Litwick: heres what I dont get, your blissy had fucking high defense but my aerial ace nearley destroyed it..whats up with that?
6-6-6 The number of The Beast.........
00,03My Blissey has max IV's and EV's on HP! :D
Dark92Enigma: /)
Oh Ok alexxm.....
FINALLY MY INTERNET IS BACK
I never got the point of EV's and IV's
hey deadeagle hows your day been
Omega: The fuck are you talkng about?
who's up next?
NEXT-----
Litwick: when we had our battle
Derpy_Hooves: me
scoot-scootaloo: on a which game
EV's and IV's were way to complicated for that game imo
Omega: We battled?
Oh wait we didnt wrong person
WHpp[s
EVs were easier
I have to admit, we did make a lot of mistakes in the course of the Vietnam war. Pulling out at the time that we did was probably the worst by far.
xDD
Well, my eyes are starting to hurt so it must be time to go to bed.
IVs are a little confusing
'night all
G'night everypony.
who's streaming next?
00,03I used to battle competitively during Gen4
IV's are 10000000times more complex
'Cause this is filler <--- Filler Time!
cya Meanwhile
o.0
Good night Meanwhile
Hot Cocoooooooooooooo
You know how Mewtwo is supposed to be menacing?\
hes is?
Mine has a timid nature...it sounds ironic
IV's must be the part im remembering then
Omega: Blisseys have retardedly high SPECIAL defense. Blisseys have shitty PHYSICAL DEFENSE. And since Aerial Ace is a physical move.... do the math.
I haven't played in quite some time
Here this will help ya sleep meanwhile http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA34YhfDMIw
EV's are effort values, I forgot what IV stood for.
natures and EVs are the main things i pay attention to
xD
My mewtwo is special
Guess why it is
If you ever wondered why we wee in Iraq for so many years after Saddam Hussein died, it was probably to prevent a repeat of the end of the Vietnam War.
I want hot cocoooo
IV is individual value
Oh yeah
cant be changed over time, its when you catch it i think
ohai LunaTheBeloved
Oh hai again Gir!
00,03I had a video of myself playing competitively over Pokemon Battle Revolution!
My mewtwo knows Aura Sphere
Cell eberypony
*everypony
hi Dark92Enigma lol
EV's come with the nature and IV's come with things like "likes to eat"
scoot-scootaloo: LINK? O_O
Gir? Are you GirDash?
Or is it GilDash?
Seriously.. what are you talking about? When i read.. its suddenly about some random war, or about pokemon.. xD
pikorar no
Timid is a good nature for my mewtwo it boosts special attack
Link: Excuuuuuse me princess!
wb woona
Gir: Your name is familiar is all.
EVs are based on nature and points, different pokemon killed give different EVs
pikorar: meh
00,03Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhzwnkWYjx4&list=FLUTJAI-vpHNAYH9eOVmrZSw&index=54&feature=plpp_video
I also have a Viticini with Fusion Flare,Fusion Bolt, and V Create
Cello
00,03I'm Sculp20 on it
icybeauti: yeah ^^
I feel OP
IVs if i am correct, are set when you catch them
okay that sucked :)
To put it simply, If you kill a certain pokemon with say, a high attack stat, an EV for attack would add to your pokemon
oh fail
storm passed by about an hour 15 minutes ago, just NOW lost power :p
Is there anyway to tell if a shiny is legit?
you still have link scoot? my thing crashed

Ryunosuke: I woke up at 5am to the sound of thunder
I set my xbox to redownload all the borderlands dlcs, although it keeps disconnecting
oh ello there LunaTheBeloved
I used to love the pokemon anime
I stopped after season 2

Mmm
00,03Sure http://derpy.me/hJkr6
Cello Shamroc
my buddy caught a shiny bidoof, and rage sold his game
and yet you still have the internet Ryunosuke
pfff bidoof..I wouldent even use a shiny one
Kandarihu : pride, revenge, and stubbornness
and back
what I miss?
Shiny Sawsbuck is best shiny
Wrek: you going to bed man?
anyway ima catch up on farming in rotmg -_-
The reason why Pikachu lost to a SNIVY THAT NEVER BATTLED BEFORE is retarded
rotmg?
Who said ROTMG?
It kept him from using electic attacks
Hi all.
realm of the mad god? :D
he was obsessed with finding any shiny for a few years, and he got bidoof. i dont think he's touched pokemon sinse
suddenly I come back to pokemon discussions
Im pretty sure Pikachu still knows Irontail
Wait, any stream right now?
deadeagle: OH that shooter MMMO
hey WallDives hows your day been
ROTMG isa such a kickass game.
You guys wanna watch the most.. random movie you've seen in a while?? =O
TheRainbowDash: Wrek just signed off

pon6258 : bronystate.net/newsletter
RX-78-SweetieBot: They are probably still tallying them

sleepy Entei don't give a buck!
Dark92Enigma: the crowd was insane. Dayton is a former ECW stronghold, so...
Also I tried to use arena trap on entei it didnt wwork
Stronghold reminds me of endless online....
Cyan havent gotten any new messages xD
I think it either killed me, or it used roar
frozen Entei don't give a buck either
Raikou and Entei dont care.
WallDives........And R-Truth and Kofi are tag champs!
I love how they make catching them even more of a bitch because they have roar
... All i say. Is blissy- With counter.
xD
RX-78-SweetieBot: you there?
yes
actually
Also I was sad nearly half of my 100/70 team died to a level 1 cottenee
Dark92Enigma: Kofi gat the biggest pop of the night besides CM Punk.
with ...
watching some skyrim :)
OOHHH
umm, I want to say loudred with some sort of block move works wonders
It's because Cottonees/Whismicotts are fucking trolls.
something with soundproof and block ;)
02ohai Aurora
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwFZYCwnS0
then it fucking used a damage builder move
No, shadow tag is worst thing
WallDives You bet! and Daniel Bryan will face him for the WWE title! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!

-_-
Nope xD
TheRainbowDash, should i have seen it before? xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwFZYCwnS0 I was raised listening to this song and it still gives me chills.
Airpuff: Who hasn't seen Epic Wub Time? Apparently you.:)
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/19159/absurd_res-adavis959-alpha_channel-alternate_color
I hate when people switch the roles in This Day Aria and claim it as a "colt version". IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A MALE CADENCE AND A FEMALE CHINING ARMOR.
(F)ocus Sash, (E)ndeavor, Quick (A)ttack on (R)attata.
me everytime i die in games http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1396/
Bronysith: When I die in games, I OR close the game calmly, OR continue playing

Bronysith: Same
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uwFZYCwnS0 I was raised listening to this song and it still gives me chills.

otakon: Time to get on Chrome, young padawan
xD
02Aurora
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/472/
02what's it called when an animation doesn't move how it should?
Linkerman: Chrome doesn't want to work for Bronystate
bad animation
/me flees
02XD
I tried Chrome it sucked
Linkerman padawan where i must slay him
lol what
/me lightsabers Bronysith pre-emptively in the head.
Bronysith: *Puts on glasses to look incognito* Down this way
but I like Chrome...
not today short and ashy
02was wanting to know to proper word for that
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/19103/alicorn-blue_hair-equine-female-generation_4-horn-
there's no term for it
/me deflects otakon s futile attack
02oh
oh
well
there is
otakon x death
"crap"
but yeah
Project Chaos makes the best remixes
/me forcepushes Bronysith out of a airlock
02LOL
hmm.
Bronysith: otakon x no chance.:D
/me force pulls otakon with him
02-to +the
Bronysith: damn you!
/me force jumps back into ship
oh I was right for once
otakon: woah hey..what are you doing to my air lock?
yay
/me locks door
/me burns through the door
/me watches as the padawans head explodes
02you're sure there isn't a proper word for that?
Space don't work like that!
/me prepares for epic lightsaber battle
enope
/me force chokes otakon
I'm not 100% sure of what you're talking about
"doesn't move how it should"
is very vague
/me lightsaber throws at Bronysith
I tried every move i had WallDives and I could not beat the bastard..it even had a focus sash i believe
at the fucking gala :D
/me brings in Scootaloo
Only due to luck I killed it
/me catches the lightsaber
/me begins to dual wield
Nearly killed half my team though
/me force pushes Bronysith into a wall
Hi everypony!
/me force shocks otakon
O hai der
02well, pretty much just that
/me resists through sheer will
02not doing what you want it to
...
otakon x death
otakon!
/me uses Force Crush on Bronysith
I refuse to accept that loss with honor...it was so bullshit
2D....3D.......
/me clings non-sexually
hello StinkomanFan
digital 2D
/me uses force crush on otakon
flash
Are you guys epic for the most epic shit evar?! xD
My question has been answered, everypony! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbhkwM5RM54
020_o
why are you clinging to me non-sexually?
only a sith can use force crush
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/18940/alpha_channel-angry-changeling-changeling_queen-di
you got caught in a gimmick set. it happens, thats why its a gimmick. it doesnt work twice, because it doesnt have to.
Bronysith: jokes on you I'm a GREY!
I just do that otakon
It was so unfair
bye ppl
Winning > Honor > Cheating.
otakon: shows what you know im pinkie pie side
by Gir
02was talking about 3D
grap
bye Gir.
anyway enough of this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0 Wounder how many who will watch this.... :D
/me uses force party cannon
Like my Sporeloom.
rig could be broken
Everyone watch Airpuff's video, it's good
motion arc could be broken
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opU5L1tQ-tE This is much better
you only need to get caught once.
/me force chokes Airpuff
So, I goit to play some TF2
xDD
Anypony else know about the Solemn vow?
nope.
02In 2D everything is pretty much manual if I'm right
OMG
Seems i managed to roll' some of ya
The weapon that lets you see enemy health?
that spore low kick spam made me so angry...
the meet the pyro video is finnaly released http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4m4lnjxkY
again it depends
I mean, I found it randomly dropped
Take it away Fluttershy!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTZctTG6cE
2D traditional, 2D digital, Flash
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs9-N16CkNs She's flutterlicious
I screwed it up though.
You still managed to kick my ass
guys theres no stream
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww0ecdhL6n8&feature=related Check this out...this was so well done
02well I know 2D traditional is manual
00,03Nope, no stream.
WallDives: I was trying to stay near your level
00,03Everyone go to sleep :)
yep
Apperently that was my downfall
Time to go to bed!
2D digital is mostly manual, it's possible to make some of it generated
um its the afteroon over here
Everyone sleep ಠ_ಠ
Flash is half and half, depending on how you use it
02ah
I mean, considering the circumstances, you did good.
NEVER! You cannot force me!:[
the guy who made that animation of doomsday zome got a job at bioware
:'(
00,03Ahhh shhooo~
Bye ScootaSleep! Silly filly...:D
Also, I need to grind my levels, but I dont know where...
Airpuff: You don't wanna make Fluttershy cry do you? :(
also, its too early for sleep.
I had forgotton how much I love Borderlands
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1855/
02I'm really bad at anything flash XD
thats was a good game
shit ending
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsf6s-FxrmU OH NO
I'm back
better than sopranos still
my USB derped again
.... You make fluttershy cry by making her go to bed :'(
flash is annoying unless you use it for digital 2D animation
I don't use it for standard flash animation
I guess theres a lot of Fluttershy fans here...
NUUUU Fluttershy cried!
she is OP though.
:'(
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMPBmt3IvPI&feature=relmfu And this is why Gilda was never seen again
the DLCs gave it a good ending
Who did this ಠ_ಠ
everytime fluttershy cries A PUPPY DIES
Yeah
o yea
Lol
Who is responsible for making her cry?! D=
http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/30972-the-other-animated-titanic-movie
and a giant crab
wait borderlands or the sopranos
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJC06XGN8Ro
/me pulls out a bat credit card
>_>
/me has a troll face
No! Fluttershy, don't cry!
I dont have an actual windpipe
(chokes ScootaSleep to get him back up) Wake up!:D
Dark92Enigma: everytime she cries a puppy dies
/me goes ape shit
JEEYSUS!
Bronysith True story
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMCW5wvg4lU&feature=relmfu YOU CAN NOT BEAT HER
yeah. Fluttershy. Overpowered.
"I am weak and helpless" bullshit
/me has a katoki face
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=kEOpr2jai9c
Cutest smile ever *-*
/me has a rape face
although considering close to a million people would jump to her defense in a instant is saying something however.
weak and helpless doesnt get a instant kill attack.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q351Dr011Pc&feature=relmfu Aw....
WallDives: Tonberry's
only Getter pilots are allowed to have real rape faces.
I highly reccomend playing Ponymon :D
Daw...
Fluttershy is.. most...
ok well
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOc_N0mYe18&feature=relmfu
adorable pony?
back to your earlier question
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3181/
otakon: Master Pugs/Tonberrys arent weak.
I can't think of any actual terms for the matter
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3181/
Fluttershy is angry! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0emeaSF6uPY&feature=relmfu
I'm not sure why it was so important for you to know
WallDives: but they are CUTE looking
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2042/
otakon: cute was never in the discussion.
if it's not working correctly, then it's probably your own error
02Just was curious :'D
Moar ponies less sleep!
WallDives: oh I thought it was....
exactly
Airpuff: down with sleep up with ponies!
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1059/

http://swtorponies.forumotion.com/t46-why-u-no-post-moar

otakon: its a fighting game. the two are synomous.
Spell-of-Gaming: no one streming atm
WallDives: but they are not the same
I'm going to worry about animating them yes
I don't care to build them or rig them
/me sighs
WallDives: maybe in MORTAL KOMBAT but not in FiM
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3409/
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4414/
WallDives: they don't kill people in Street Fighter for one.
otakon: doesnt stop FS's stare from being a instant KO, if that makes you feel better.
Bronysith ahaha epic xD
