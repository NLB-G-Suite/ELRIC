Dawnguard was bigger
We've GOT to have...... money.
otakon: how sma... not bad
otakon: why do they call farcry 3 "skyrim with guns" when that title is reserved for fallou
Bronysith: lol yeah kind of
SuperBrony64: PENDING? Damnit. *Sits on hold, for like, years*
13skyrim with guns?
13but skyrim is fallout with swords
13and fallout was oblivion with guns
"An echo of RdR"
13and oblivion was morrowind minus everything
Mmmhm.
And morrowind was.......actually, I don't know. I've never played Morrowind.

AJIsHaunter: do you have an old XBOX?

SuperBrony64: Its been like 2 months. You guys talk in slowmo. But thats okay, because I love you. :3

And then MASF123 Got g-k kicked again
Son-of-a-Gak. >:(
I swear, type "Gak Brony" In google... and... well guess.
BlazeAngel: Um, no thanks.

I bought 5 cans of a certain rubber stuff after season 3 premeir
Bronysith: Not everyone's a dick the internet, you know. There ARE some nice people.
But just because you're on the internet doesnt mean you have to expect rudeness all around.
LadyCanary: But I don't say, "Gak". :O
Whoever says THE WORD, gets kicked.
Not joking

AND THE CALL WAS COMING FROM INSTEAD THE HOUSE
*:D
That's ridiculous, everyone knows houses can't speak.
then who was phone
?
If they could speak....
CriticKitten: When you're around, of course. ;)
The stories they would tell. I mean the people who lived in my house before me and my family were religious nuts.
13we should not let houses talk
But how will they tell you it's not lupus?
Or if someone is robbing the house
13but
13well
13make the house move then
13at least then it can do something about robbers
Tbh if you're within earshot of the house I'd like to think you'd notice someone robbing it.
It's never lupus, so they don't need to tell us.

Kipkat07_USAF: just wait for steam sale
With a 24 bit soundcard

Only has stero, no surround
Trying to go one on one with a max at point blank. Yeah that'll end well.
I want to check if I can upgrade my RAM but my mom would rip my arms off and beat me to death with them

shes super paranoid about my computer
ok?
Kipkat07_USAF: One sec, matey
What motherboard do you have?
every time I run tests on my computer she has a heart attack
Serenity1: IDK one sec
That's an odd model
Never heard of it...

SR5707C Serenity
Michael: yesh
rawr
i r a kitteh
i liek kitteh
Kipkat07_USAF: It likes up to 4gb
Sorry that took some time, the usual site didn't have that model wierdly enough
Serenity: past that?
are you on a 64bit OS?
If you use 64 bit, then you can make use of the ful 4gb, but if you're on 32 bit, then you can only use 2.5 or 3.5
11,02i liek poniez :3c
NO WAI
Ohai, SB.
11,02:D
11,02imma go and i brb :3
/me gives SuperBrony64 poniez
if you guys are wondering wheather you can run the game, it may be on canyourunit.com i think
Basically, 4gb max is safe, might be able to sneak 5gb somehow, but I don't think that's a good idea
Espeically when you're using HP
/me plays with the poniez :3
"NO WAY?" "NO WAY!"
SuperBrony64|AFK: Can I play with u :3
11,02yesh :3
Yey
11,02we play
/me Plays with the poniez and SuperBrony64|AFK
11,02Battleship o.o
11,02The movie the game
The book
The ARG
11,02the soundtrack
Battleship: the Hit Game Based off of The Hit Movie!
11,02^
lol
11,02Did you know that they made a Street Fighter movie a long time ago?
OF COURSE.
SuperBrony64|AFK: I do. :D
SuperBrony64|AFK: oh yeah
11,02...and then they made a game based off that movie
SuperBrony64|AFK: Which of the 3?
and the sequels
Best movie ever.
forgotten about it
Because, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life.
11,02So it was Street Fighter: The Movie The Game
also a mario movie
11,02And it sucked :P
13pff you all forget the greatest movie to game conversion ever
LadyCanary: "OF COURSE!"
But for me, it was tuesday.
Shizuka: ET?
13super mario brothers
The Mario film isn't bad when you forget it's Mario
IKR?!
Shizuka: DON'T DISS THAT MOVIE; IT WAS AWESOME
11,02But...but...
Trust the fungus.
mario movie was best movie
11,02Mario was a game before a movie ;^;
i thought it was pretty shitty that they scrweed up the goomba designs in teh game so much
13was not
11,02D:
how can they be so off course
was too
what i dont get is
11,02ARE TOO
how are they making a shadow of the colossus movie?
YALL WHACK
they're what?
Buytoast: Making a Shadow Of The Collosus movie.
also a Legend of Zelda i heard
well then
SoC could make a cool artsy movie
11,02Candy Land: The Movie 'Just when you thought things were all candy and sweets...'
to bad it won't be that and will suck lol
get that genny turkadashi guy on it
he can probably make a good one
SuperBrony64|AFK: sounds more like a horro/gore movie
13monopoly
13the movie
horror*
imagine a Lord Licorice torture scene
how...
delicious
To be honest, SoC would seem like a pretty good movie if it was done right.
11,02Shizuka: Think that's called Fahrenheit 9/11
Good Evening everybrony!
Monopoly "It's all fun and games...until you go straight to jail."
11,02Starring Rob Schnieder?
What do you mean?
11,02He's in all those cheesy movies
Monopoly made into a Movie?...yuk
what about yatzee
:>
ALSO Clue.
that too
Rob Schieder is the wacky Uncle Moneybags in this heartwarming family comedy! Falsely accused of a housing scheme, Moneybags must go around the city and clear his name, or else he'll GO directly to jail!"
what about a movie about Trivial Pursuit ?
I hate it already.
Clue was a good movie
Rated PG for mild violence and pattial nudity.
partial
Around the city? why not around the U.S.A since the Properties names were based on states?
goddamn it sounds like some crappy cross between Arthur and the fugitive

C++, You accidently create a dozen instances of yourself and shoot them all in the foot. Providing emergency medical assistance is impossible since you can't tell which are bitwise copies and which are just pointing at others and saying "That's me, over there."

Buytoast: dohoho
Okay, Zin is an awesome villain.

wtf
"Look what the writers pulled out of there asses!"
i wanna build one of those robots
how was there that much space inside those things
actually, if you can enforce the joints well enough
its feasable
Rose`: except for the power requirements
DARING DO AM WINNING AGAIN
StinkomanFan: Actually, those robots were in the earliest series-- and well, one f Zin's first appearances.
hahahaha, lets let her keep a dangerous ancient artifact
hahahaha

i have no idea
maybe the souls of orphan children

Ohai Rose` :P
this is kinda like fallout
just saying
Except Fallout was enjoyable
that
:<
05now i feel like playing fallout again, thanks Rose` >:C
Hehe, please do Wrek :P
i would love you to stream that wrek
also, just know, i refuse to come on to you :3
Dont.
oh my
because i like LadyCanary too much for that to happen :3
>_______________<
05atleast these eps are proper quality
/me has bought FNV Ultimate Edition recently
i never go to sleep...
How is it SirGanjalf?
i don't think i'd ever play one of those fallout games
it's just skyrim with guns
StinkomanFan: The one with all DLC's
GameStop has a good deal this week, Epic Mickey 2 is 20 bucks off
right, im off to dinner
fallout 1 was amazing
05tahts where you are wrong Buytoast
later
05for isntance
alone.
No, HOW was it SirGanjalf?
Take care Rose`!
by myself
T-T
Italia!
its not that i cant get a date, its a matter of quality
isn't Epic Mickey 2 a brand spanking new game?
05skyrim is no way near the story depth of New Vegas
Buytoast, well skyrim is just fallout with magic
boo fucking hoo
Buytoast: Yes
and they're already selling it at 20 bucks off?
Buytoast: Only for a week
what should I name my website?
05skyrim was more of a tehc est
Bronysith: Need a tissue?
05seeing how the Main quest lacked depth
LadyCanary: not me XD
05and the side quest quickly got repetitive
I prefered Fallout TBH
StinkomanFan: Oh, haven't played it yet - need more free time and disk space:<
yeah, i got bored with skyrim pretty quick
Buytoast: And it's a GameStop only deal
New Vegas has some of the best DLC ever made for anything imo
i regret buying it for 60 bucks
thank you wrek
YES!
I LOVE THIS EP!
Freddy Kruger!
ZOMBIES
thank you Wrek
Boy, are you ugly
use torrent
be bad guy
Hi everyone! :)
hell i'd probably give fallout a whirl if i got a copy for free or cheap or something
Howdy JFFS!
Buytoast: What part did you bought
?
and ANOTHER animation change
Interestingly, (i just looked it up) Zin never MET any of the quest team in the original series-- not face to face. That didn't happen until "The New Adventures", and at the beginning of "The Real Adventures" he's thought to be dead-- but showed up again in Season 2.
Wrek: how many animation styles did this show go through back then?
i just bought it for 60 bucks when it came out
i gave into the hype
05otakon: i have no idea what you are talkign about
yeah these two putz'
Buytoast: You mean Fallout 3?
SCIENCE
no, skyrim
Zin strikes me as the kind of guy who never really dies
Wrek: the animation, the character designs have changed
...did i just hear de lancie?
^eeyup
Dark_Horst yep
duhuhude
05all i notice is Dr Quest
05otehr than that
dr Venture
05the only time it changes is qhen it shifts between questworld and the "real" world
Wrek: Quest and the others, if you compare this to the "Spectre of the Pine Barens"
That's some...quest.

08,01i don't suppose any of you have any experience writing JVM bytecode?
depends
Hey Wrek the other day you told me not to talk about the comic if it has to do with the unaired episodes. However, M.A.Larson mentioned on his Twitter that he "knows nothing about the comic and is seperate from what we're doing". If the comic is a different continuity than the show, can we speak of the new issues a certain time after they go on sale(Not an arguement of the rules, just curious on how you'll stand with the comic)?
what does JVM mean?
nyeh

Buytoast: That's not how you spell speckled butter beans
frozen vegetables are much better than canned ones
Kandarihu: oh lol

canned vegetables are sinful, wicked creations designed to pollute the masses
NewDCD >:

Any thoughts?
Haku1013: Sorry man, I don't that kind of discussion is allowed here.

cachi01, Eeyup, you would say so, and I would too. xD
No, we're allowed to reference those stories
Just not talk about them
but this is an original thing
Just thought up by me recently
Haku1013: they have nothing in common. except that cupcakes was kinda rushed and rainbow factory is based on a song. and its pretty well written also
08,01Haku1013: what genre will it be?
Grim-dark most likely, why?
Cachi01 Im talking abou he fanfics not the song

CriticKitten: dude I've seen kids get their heads blown off by lasers and one girlfriend of the protag exploded due to a bomb in her neck
It ain't over yet!
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24086151.jpg
09,01then again that's his alternate universe counterpart
Brony_ponies: nothing
"A guy has a really, really shitty life, then he dies. The End."

CriticKitten: sounds about it
Alright, next episode?

There's a part 7? O_o
09,01this ending is feels

NewDCD: goddamn I love this show
otakon: And I've seen people with large gaping holes blown through their chests still survive because "durr I'm magical". What's your point?

A raptor with a degree in metaphysics?
Well we don't actually wield control of the internet. It's been doing fine in U.S. hands, and unless the government starts abusing that, it shouldn't change. The U.N. answers to dictatorships, so we don't want them running the internet.

they must have had so much fun doing this
such as?
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
lol this SO reminds me of Akibaranger :D
go offline for months.
Kyoto Animation needs to do more action anime.
This is just glorious.
XD
oh :/

oh japan and their cute girls fighting eachother
and ofc announcing your attacks is in FULL SWING
:D
lol
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
:D
>:l
oh shit i can't stop laughing
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
I was also not the greatest mod at times
What you want, Joomay?
otakon: Rule of anime, announcing your attack's name makes it stronger.
Nothing.
I only started laughing when they started spinning.
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a fursuit
CriticKitten: eeyup
SF started to get a reputation for being to strict
...

THEY NEEED ONE MORE STILL!
MUAI MASTAH
NewDCD: lol this reminds me of Akibaranger :D ya might like it,think THIS but w/ Super Sentai

Good night guys :)
Cause trouble for the establishment and all that
and the whole Razz thing
ngiht sonicdude558 sleep well
CriticKitten, I think the idea is that any attack that's special in any way has a name to it, and it's proper to announce the name as the attack is being used.
Sorry about the fursuit thing
FORESHADOWING *Inception DUUUUN sound*
and inb4 Shinka is a secret Chuu
/me *Slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout

Kandarihu: Except that it's actually stated in many shows that announcing the name of an attack makes it stronger.

09,01Endless Eight left a terrible taste in my mouth
NewDCD: ugh Haruhi
NewDCD: Did you see the second season and the movie?

she has no redeeming qualities in my eyes as a character
haruhi is the cutest-looking anime character ever imo
09,01and didn't watch Clannad
Haruhi was very annoying to me.
Hyouka eyes are freaking hypnotic.
CriticKitten: maybe she got her name wrong?
And Clannad is freaking beautiful.
yeah but she's an utterly manipulative bitch
but as a character she's prett meh, yeah
:O dat ass
RoboGerbil: Maybe so.
:S
Like Chuunibyou here, Clannad starts out kinda rough.
AJIsHaunter: this is haruhi the god, right?
09,01Clannad was a VN adaptation though

Freaking LOVE Yuuta's mom.
.........
,,,,
ONNICHAN
she's a high energy mom it seems
AJIsHaunter: may i have an apple now?
xD
WHO SAID DAT?!
09,01Their mom looks more like she could be their big sister
NewDCD: eeyup
GRIT THOSE TEETH!
onnichan :)
no
I can't
WHO SAID THAT
AJIsHaunter: may i have an apple now
6^2 i think
Filly_Lightstar: But I don't have any apples. :S
2/12 i think
well -1
NOW YA BUCKED UP :D
(2/6)^2
:|
well a three
1/6*
so 2/1
/me gives Filly_Lightstar an apple to make them stop talking.
4/12
jcelios: i think she means rolling 3 with both dice
she has a gun...wut
or 1/4
/me takes apple
I think?
otakon: no
:D
/me reads book somemore
trixie_squirtle: okay than what ARE the odds of rolling a 3 with two dice?
Rikka really needs to stop being so damn adorable.
youre assuming they use a 6 sided dice
otakon: unless.. idk what they meant, i though 2 with both
its 1/12
*3
RoboGerbil: well what would they use?
don't you make a valid argument
those are terrible
lawl OOC
No it's not. >_>
otakon: i dunno, d10, d100? lol
RoboGerbil: that's not a standard die
OOC IS CANON
i would like some tea
OOC?
^
otakon: depends on what game you play
otakon, d10 and d1000 are both sandard die
It's 1/6 * 1/6. You measure each probability independently and multiply to combine their possibilities. :p
otakon: Out Of Character
RoboGerbil: it's a math question
jcelios: theres another 3, so wouldnt that be 2/12?
/me loves the D-golfball
ah
!
dat ringtone
CriticKitten: well thats what i thought but thats if they meant rolling 3 with both, unless they mean rolling a sum of 3
I need that ringtone
dats a ringtone
a'www
Touka is freaking sexy. It's the eyes.
09,01they mean rolling a sum of 3
she's alone on the weekends
goodnight guys :)
NewDCD: so a one and a two right?
then that would be 2/36
/me reads book about flying
Then you'd need to account for all possibilities that equal 3.
09,01yeah
Night, RDash5000. :)
Goodnight RDash5000
/me hands AJIsHaunter cardboard box "Take care of your box,and it'll take care of you..." :D
trixie_squirtle: simplify it, 1/18
HAHAHA
Which is basically just 1/2 and 2/1, so....1/18.
otakon: yes thank you, i can divide by two :P
trixie_squirtle: god I'm so rusty on math :P
Hey, I do still remember probability stuffs. Huh.
I haven't used any higher math since High School
....
ouch
FEELS
DAMN YOU FEELS
otakon: man i suck at division >~<
otakon: dont think you did higher math in high school though
/me throws book in air
otakon: What happened?
EXPOSION
/me make book floats
trixie_squirtle: not really, just basic alegebra really is all I can remember taking
/me bring book bakdown
AJIsHaunter: Rikka was talking about how she's alone on the weekends and that no one acknowledges her existence bu her sister
otakon: Oh, I see.
:D
Wow, that sucks. :(
lol
wat?
dem crimson eyes
otakon: yeah i dont think they teach higher stuffs in high school, higher is at least calc, although idk whats considered higher
SHE'S PLAYING WITH HIS KID SISTER
....what is with the collar? O.o
LADLE OF DOOM!
CriticKitten: fashion statement
house, i miss that game
otakon: lol and they had a divorce :D
CriticKitten: inb4 she used to be a big chuun too
/me lays head sideways on book

CriticKitten: so? neither is wearing a pullover but I used to bc I liked to

YOU CAN DO IT RIKKA!

funny she doesnt doubt her eye because it never helped her with math
Filly_Lightstar: yeah but do it quietly
trixie_squirtle: very delusional
/me pokes otakon
and she wasted all of her time
otakon: kinda sad..
well shite
yay for low averages :D

Aww. ,3
*<3
otakon: Neeeeeeerd. <3
/me pokes AJIsHaunter

HoodEvee, well granted I've only read like 4 chapters so far
Filly_Lightstar: Not sure if saucy...
but so far I've read nothing about Scootaloo except maybe for a hint
even then I'm not sure
King: yeah very random, the same thing 4 times
CrystalPhoenix: whats this about scootaloo?
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT THE BEST CMC
trixie_squirtle: He's consistently random :P
HoodEvee: like you
RoboGerbil, I'm making everyone guess what fiction I've recentely faved based on this picture http://i.imgur.com/AYhof.jpg
:>
thelonecubone: I am no such thing!
Besides, why would I punch my kitty? That'd be like punching Fluttershy >_>
CrystalPhoenix: It's not by shortskirtsandexplosions, my gut tells me so
HoodEvee: but you are random most of the time :P
except fluttershy would beat you up after that
shes aggressive, its a fact
CrystalPhoenix: wow you starred 196 fics?
HoodEvee, well I do ADORE Background Pony but that fiction only has like 20 chapters
Aggressively cute :3

CrystalPhoenix: Most likely?
thelonecubone: awesome OC! i kinda need one
CrystalPhoenix: lol i only spend a few hours a week on it, and im not even into reading
crest pro health for life
Dark92Enigma: it's not awesome, cant be compared to your guys OC (but Mary sue OC's....)

13okay so if i say i'm a sinner then i'm not a sinner
11,02trixie_squirtle: Pandaren :D Imma Shaman :3
13but that means i say i'm not a sinner, but that means i don't recognize i have sin and am therefore a sinner
/me pokes SuperPanda64 :3
13i'm going to go with true on that one.. hey why are those turrets twitching
SuperBrony64|WoW: aw, no moos den .-.

Sleep well Wisconsin boy

sorry shizuka

SHE'S BEEN IN THE WOODS
OF COURSE SHES COLD
the ads on ustream wouldn't but me so much if they wernt so freaking loud
13nope
CrystalPhoenix: nope, cuz it explains the circumstances
13more importantly she touched the wall
the_real_pony_1604: i know that feel, get adblock
DRAMATIC MUSIC
It had drawings of pony.
lol and they they were stranded
I have adblock, thats the thing
She could not help but touch.
"Did you touch the wall?" Yes, the well wasn't exactly HUGE or anything, lady, and I had to touch it to climb up
*then
the_real_pony_1604: uh, weird
13the city walls
Oh?
walls are evil
adn dangerous
I can never seem to block the ads on ustream
13you can't trust walls
13or wheels
do not touch the wall! http://puu.sh/1cLIV
the letter w is the puppet master it seems
Buytoast: Walls seperate us from the ponies. Without them, we would be invaded
Naw, walls aren't dangerous. It's not the walls, it's the railings on top of the walls.
which means
HoodEvee: I wouldn't mind hat...
seseme street is the herald of darkness
Because the height + the fact that railings are there DRAMATICALLY increase the odds of a railing death
put the WHEELS AGAINST THE WALL!!!!!!
but the next one i plan on reading after a bluebirds song will be Tales from Mystika
Datcord: You would when it happens
trixie_squirtle: Duwang, right?
thelonecubone: yus :>
Buytoast: Its all for show, they just pretend they can get through
well I suppose I'll go to bed now but first
trixie_squirtle: Lel
left the key in the ignition
Trying to get intoour minds
nice town
Sonic 06 part 20 is by far the best gamegrumps episode
inb4 theyre terrible
CrystalPhoenix: Okay, bye

HoodEvee: Mind control? Well, at least something very interesting happens in my life.
Thats what they want you to think

I know. I love it
i just joined whats this we are watching?
But people being mad at you

HoodEvee: was it fun?
No
My mother was, for lack of a better word, pissed

haha
13it's the murder mystery ep
Ah, I see.
I've seen little of this, so this should be interesting.
13sadly i think the epic gaming episode is the very last one
Shizuka, I'm pretty sure it's the episode about the downtime that's at the end.
13EYY CUZZIN WANT TO GO SHOOT POOL
it is, and I still want to know if anyone made that game IRL. bronys would have about 4 versions by now
I meant to say murder instead of the strange twist in order of accidently saying spoilers.
I need to redownload this series so I can go over it again.
Is Majong usualy this dramatic?
Well.
13SpadeKyurem[R]: very
I planned on going to sleep

You know what? My first experience of Hare Hare Yukai was this weird flash that crossed this with a really bad series called "Musashi Gun-Doh" and it was HILLARIOUS!
like little hard cakes
wasnt there a Comic book similar to this?
are all those websites safe?
Oh, I've heard this anime through people talking about it. How is it?
Probably not

OK. I knew that Japan had manga about playing Mah-jonng, action manga even. An anime was unexpected. Then again...

Eyeshield 21 or wahtever
that is all I have to say
at least nothing that's obviously porn from looking at the url
AJIsHaunter: Well, it's more likely that there's a manga. If it's really successful, then...
.....
Um, what was that? :S
AJIsHaunter: what
texasboykc09: Mmm, never mind. I just thought I saw something weird.

I missed about four episodes. I'll be around later.
-_- I'm interested in the series now, but I don't wanna spoil it, so I'll bow out for now.
I had like 3 months of it last time I applied
Ive got close to 5 years
they always send an email that's like "we do not currently have a position for you at this time"
One year for me, and the only reason I left the place I was working was because of relocating.
wait wut
they can do that? lul
13yeah.. if you recall the start of the series, growing the wings isn't exactly painless
13reki's introduction to the world wasn't very pleasant
I'm sure youl be fine
I remember my first interview, I was freaking out
it was minimum wage, but cant complain since it was my first job :P
I've actually gotten really good at interviews
My first one was awful though :P

HoodEvee: books are evil
Oh my she's back

lol
Goodnight, AttackWithZzz

He should be dead

13just imagine that for a moment :P
...
Oh dear
my brain exploded
That is uncanny.
13ikr
/me clen up Sylandest brains
They're only dolls. Why do you blush?
yep. Thats my brain gone ker-splat on the wall. Ty, Shizuka
I imagined dolls riding spider robots with explosions in the background
Polydunami: sexy dolls
dari, there was some guy on youtube who made spyroish music, do you know what I'm talking about?
13>do shinku later, colors might run
13>the others have brighter outfits
Yeah, no. They're still DOLLS.
Polydunami: i asume
the cute
/me blows bubbles at the chat
this is extremely adorable
HoodEvee: agred
agrad!
agdearqiol
I mean, they may be sentient and everything, but still. DOLLS.
Polydunami: maby ther like deta
Polydunami: Replace the word doll with pony
nevermind found it
Then you might fathom it
Now I'm curious, what was it?
MrModez
HoodEvee: or maby ther like deta
Wait, what is deta?
Polydunami: startrak
Data?
Daytuh
ah, haven't heard of him
13BUUBBLEEEEES!

13ohaiwrek
Why does he have one?
13whai you so awake
Oi Wrek, go to bread
Chat be dead anyhow
trixie_sprinkle: I like it. It's very nice. :)
what is this
HoodEvee: chat needs more eggs
Japanime
Well, I know that Rule 36 exists. But still, I don't think even a teenage boy ought to be embarrassed by a doll.
Polydunami: wut
Bah. It's no big deal.
Also, I know who Data is.
should i ask what rule 36 is
13well in his defense, like he said he forgot they were dolls, given how used he is to them running around
trixie_sprinkle: porn
13r36 is "if it exists, there is a fetish of it"
trixie_sprinkle, not sure the exact wording, but it's just there's a opposite sex variation of everything
heh, ok
._.
13that's 63
trixie_sprinkle: its porn that kills your chiled hood
My hood ;~;
ohright, misread >.<
geeky-egg: that and r34
http://www.polarpiece.com/en/
trixie_sprinkle: porn
that screams canadian
1334 is "if it exists, there is porn of it", 35 is "if porn of it doesn't exist, it will be immediately created", and 36 is "if it exists, it is someone's fetish"
Wait, can she move her toes as well?
for some reason.
why do i want one though.
Polydunami: Well, seeing as she's a magic fucking doll, sure why not?
all dem porn rules, although its the internet, so it makes sense
Looks like snuggies
Okay, thanks for the kind answer.
13eesh nori keep that stuff in your d... i guess they are in your dreams bust still eeeeeesh...
Polydunami: Sorry, not trying to be rude :S
No worries, I can sympatize :$
/me slaps hoodini around a bit with a large cow
why are they so expensive? XD
its definitely not a snuggie
Hoodini?
That's new
probably because they are not made overseas.
Hey that's my milk cow!
not anymore
13shinku figures she isn't going to make it through the duel, thus the sudden niceness
Wait, sayonara?
daaaaw she as a soft side ^_^
/me slaps trixie_sprinkle a bit with a larg eg
it looks so much cooler than a snuggie.
Sweatpants, $59
/me boils the large egg, then eats it
I mean really
besides basically being a onesie that babies wear.
:P
trixie_sprinkle: your welcome
/me slaps geeky-egg around a bit with a sharp sword
im not a fan of sweatpants, i wear jeans all year around.
i hope its not cloud's sword, that would be some painful slapping
I never used to wear them
then I went to college
/me slaps HoodEvee a bit with large morningstar
A full scale metal replica of that sword weighs over 80 lbs
:I
13is it the one with the baby swords in it?
so i guess theyll come just in time to save her during the duel i guess
Yes
trixie_sprinkle: ARCHETYPES
i actually meant the buster sword one
Up next, Spongebob?
Or Bill Nye?
the the one with miniswords was also wide
Polydunami: out of bill nye unfortunately
they tried to get an investment on dragons den and got rejected
Wait, we finished the entire series?
SPONGEABUBLE
but i dunno, I kind of like it.
OOOOOHHHH
Their website is nice
I would never wear one though :P
I might. im considering it.
Arrrrrrggggg
13no no
13say it right
13repeat after me
13ARRRRR
AdamTheDuck: how are you mate

Going to bed, night guys

Night
I've seen kids eat the gum underneath school desks
._.
i wish i knew where rarity lived...
/me wears it to work.
or I dunno, maybe it is just a canadian thing
HoodEvee: what flavor?
Wha-hah! Fish eyes!
trixie_sprinkle: I don't know, I don't chew used gum
PLASTIC
HoodEvee: youre missing out~
I wonder if i could wear it to work, and just sort of doze off with the hood zipped up.
my leg!
His leg!
13LIE MEH!
trixie_sprinkle leg
i hate it when people put gum under the desks, its a good chance of it getting stuck to my pants
even worse when some prick puts it on a seat
Mr. Krabs came back
go to bread kabs
krabs*
Someone a melted starburst underneath my desk, got all over my pants
Spongebob is being reasonable?
trixie_sprinkle: i wold do that if knew who was going to sit there next
HoodEvee: was it hard to wash off?
trixie_sprinkle: Without any washing materials, yes
cuz i remember scrubbing gum off my pants in high school, it took a long time and i couldnt walk around with gum on my butt
and we had school uniform too
i hate uniforms
Hey everypony!
i actually liked uniforms, was pretty comfy
hi donutpop365
Hey there, donutpop365
you have to admit, if no one was watching, you'd wear one.
and looked smashing~
Hi, donutpop365. :)

I hated uniforms ._.
hi donutpop365
I didn't mind uniform clothes at my school.

He died
thelonepony's never on...
13i thought you said weast
Anymore that is.
I dunno, they're not very practical
AFK
donutpop365: he's on a lot actually
He's always on ._.
Okay.
donutpop365: He left recently.
he left an hour ago or so
they'd be a pain to take off
living in cold minnesota?
And he's thelonecubone lately.
Woops!
the pants would have to be detachable :P
>dry
No way. Thats what keeps you warm
>underwater

It's not a map.

I'm so loyal, I'm a blanket
i wonder if it has pockets inside.

13>renting
13wat
SB plays WoW but LoL is boring to him... what is this...
that would just anger me
oh and I guess they throw up a lot, but that's easy to clean
>comparing WoW to LoL
Panda: SUNGOEBULBEL
if i have to clean up cat pee, id probably just rather not have a cat.
wow is so much better
lol
Panda: They're both repetitive to a degree
LOL captcha, how relevant. "snow shovel"
but you get to use a blacklight to find the stains
wow isnt really that repetetive
it kinda is XD
minus the raiding
UGH another late night :P
^
Really, it's not?
I want rainbow dust
It's nice having company :)
HoodEvee: me to
pvping isnt very repetitive
we still don't have any snow here
and a lot of variety for exporation
o/
pop
it snowed once and immediately melted
:I
If you say pvp in wow isnt repetitive then the pvp in LoL isnt either XD
13WE AREN'T TALKING SOME DUMB MAIL FRAUD SCHEME OR HIJACKING HERE
13WE
13STOLE
13A
13BALLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
i got the air in whater sems leget
supposed to snow in a few days
idk, i never felt like pvp is repetetive
mostly rain
hovering around 5-8C
LoL is pretty much all pvp
Shizuka: WHEEERE's THE BALLOOOOOOOOOOOOON PARTY?
different players play differently, different tactics, different gear, different builds
national free balloon day
:I
moba games are 1 map
trixie_sprinkle: I can't tell wich game your talking about now
HoodEvee: well seeing how LoL doesnt have builds, and the general pvp tactics are always the same
....
fire
lel
:D
13JA BUNS UND THIGHS
:D
trixie_sprinkle: So, just the builds are different
ja bans and tahs
:D
lel
ok
HoodEvee: a lot more items too, +professions, different enchantments
Its more about the competitive aspect :I
HoodEvee: and each class has like 20-30 spells, contrary to moba games where there are only 4 spells per character
evil
13RECTANGLES!
If you play wow for the pvp, somethings wrong with you
hardly, the pvp is very good there
You could just go buy gw2 if you want rpg pvp
or at least it used to be, idk how it is now
he thinks he eat it now
I never liked this joke
HoodEvee: ok
WoW is considered the best mmorpg, why would i want to play gw
trixie_sprinkle: i have nver played WoW and i dont want to
but in any case, wow has much more variety than LoL
trixie_sprinkle: Mkay, I'm done here
Thats not chocolate.
night HoodEvee
geeky-egg: I meant speaking ._.
HoodEvee: ok
well ive not played gw HoodEvee , maybe the pvp is better there. but its certainly good in WoW too, and its better than moba games
hm
moar fire
trixie_sprinkle: >.> i didnt mean to start an arguement.
/me pokes HoodEvee with a stick thats on fire
geeky-egg: Warm :)
HoodEvee: your welcome :)
trixie_sprinkle: That be your onion
opinion*
:P
Goodnight HoodEvee
AdamTheDuck: I'M NOT SLEEPING
HoodEvee: whats wrong with the pvp there though? ive never seen much of a problem
AdamTheDuck: not sleeping
oops
i mean it
/me hugs AdamTheDuck
trixie_sprinkle: Eh, its just sorta a moba game on a larger scale
/me hugs geeky-egg back :P
Minus the base
13uh
13>fishing boots
AdamTheDuck: you got a OC
13>THEY ARE FISH
Nope
Shizuka: maybe its war trophies
AdamTheDuck: ok doki
still wonder how the hell he has a whale of a daughter.
Panda: Adoption?
Panda: aduption
HoodEvee, crabs would not pay for adoption.
AdamTheDuck: yah
13given pearl's crying habit
13i bet he didn't have to pay
Panda: Orphan
HoodEvee: there are skills you use in battle, that could be said for any rpg game dueling
That is a good point Shizuka.
Homeless orphan*
abduction then
trixie_sprinkle: Yeah, but all the mechanics are basically the same
batman
AFK
HoodEvee: like what? skills having cooldowns is the same fr any rpg, other than that whats the same
Ganking, combat roles, timing, ect
inb4 squeak driven insanity
HoodEvee: again thats the same for any rpg as there are different classes
trixie_sprinkle: You just said they were the same
HoodEvee: only the fact there are different combat roles and that skills have a cool down, its rpg. there are actually no combat roles 1v1
Aww, did I miss the fries part?
13THE TELL TALE SQUEAK
http://i.imgur.com/KCazy.jpg
AJIsHaunter: :D
AJIsHaunter: lol
You're not dead?
HoodEvee: When did I die? :D
trixie_sprinkle: So, whats different? Besides the Pov?
AJIsHaunter: dead
I'm still trying to figure out if this is an Edgar Allen Po reference
I loove these old episodes :3
13pretty much is
oni_link: yup
Hey oni_link
hey geeky-egg
HoodEvee: different from moba games? well that theres a loooot more factors, theres 20-30 skills, different builds, different professions, different enchantments, different playing styles based on different items. it provides a lot of variety
HoodEvee: actually thats 20-30 skills and 20-30 spells
...
Wut?
The only fucking thing you serve, dumbass
AJIsHaunter: is dead may he rest in peacs
hi HoodEvee hi and I was talking about that exact same thing with some friend today about MLP I was showing him that this show makes references not meant for kids to get
:I
HoodEvee: "Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is the beating of his hideous heart!"
HoodEvee: and different races with different racial spells
The Tell Tale heart?
Yes
awesome
the deed is done
wut
trixie_sprinkle: Not hot at all
Why not, Spongebob?
I love hidden mature context in kid shows
HoodEvee: why, theres a lot of various combinations and variety, why is it bad
oni_link: me to
trixie_sprinkle: Oh, I never said it was bad
geeky-egg: exactly why I love this show :3
inb4 one of Patrick's greatest lines.
Just that WoW isn't about PvP
Imaaaaagggginaaaaaaatttttttiiiooooooonnnnn
In a few hours I have a business test and I need some inspiration.
HoodEvee: thats for every player to decide, and the pvp there is good, and just fun. the fact that theres other things to do there makes it even better
Hahaha, I remember this episode, loved this one
turtlegod98: youre freakin turtlegod98
boxing
turtlegod98: you can do it!
13IMAGIMUUUUFFIN
lol
I love this one
im imaging my self as a pony

theyve gone too high
Hello bronystate
Ohai Moopy

Moopy: hello
K2 - inna box
^^^
hello
hiyo moo
i heard a Marivl joke
geeky-egg: oh which one?
oni_link: exselsur
lol
oni_link: i cant spell
trixie_sprinkle: They're basically the same pvp wise, and lol is more competitive and team based, and they added new game modes. Also, as far as variety goes, there's about 30-40 different heroes with different skill sets, stats, and roles, and each counteracts eachother
Heh derpy
Excelsior?
I'm jus sayin
HoodEvee: 30-40 heroes? There are over 100
Yamahawk: I be a newb
HoodEvee: trixie_sprinkle wat are you talking abut
ha
geeky-egg we'll tell you when you're older
This episode can be put in a different story. Two bronies having fun. Anti brony is watching them then in the end wants to join them.
THE SAWS ARE ON THE WAY
Imaaaaagggginaaaaaaatttttttiiiooooooonnnnn
geeky-egg: WoW and LoL
HoodEvee: its about WOW and Lol
HoodEvee: anint it
ananaANAI
didnt they choose funny words when you think about it? LoL and WoW
HoodEvee: but every character has only 4 spells, and the tactics are always the same. it mostly comes down to choosing the right items depending on your enemies, you get no say in the matter, you Have to choose the fitting items, otherwise youll lose
thats me on a staerday
lol and LoL are two different things
funny to me
trixie_sprinkle: Alot more skill than you would think
oni_link: LoL
WoW you got it geeky-egg !
lol
oni_link: he he
I made a funny :p
HoodEvee: it takes some skill of course, but it has no variety because you Need to choose specific items for enemies, if you dont choose the right items youll lose
13i love how the launch sounds like someone making the effect
oni_link: yes you did
Shizuka: now that you siad that i here it now
Man I love this place after work, best thing ever :3
lol boxception

Moopy: http://inception.davepedu.com/

but ok, night HoodEvee

Goodnight HoodEvee :P
Night, HoodEvee.
Ok it wasn't loading up
geeky-egg: what? you lost me now XD
oni_link: lol
It also sounded like Megaman's Blaster cannon in the cartoon
the horrible cartoon
trixie_sprinkle: Thats like saying tf2 is boring, it involves alot more strategy and teamwork. It's more about the competitive and teamwork aspects
But, now I leave for real
latas
HoodEvee: wow has teamplay too
oni_link: the one were megamn is not a robot
geeky-egg: we're fighting robots, Megaman! <---- only lyrics in the OP XD and yeah

Hello Sumica :)
fuck calm down
o.o
We're pretty calm watching SB play CoD .-.
the was a nice duel
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/c62513fa04d2ced8ea52a48b84096438.png Oh no, Pinkie! :D

taoumi, eeyup
Hey everypony, I'm gonna skim this chapter, and go sleepybye, it's 4:18 and I get up at 6 O.O
See y'all!
Bye donutpop365
Anyways, ciao *Huggles Every Single One of Ya*
shotguns. SuperBrony64 nemisis
CoD~ most useless game since years~
what i like about battlefienld over this is that in bf it actaly takes more than 2 bullets to kill you :/ no offense
well yah
cod is like no soldier is wearing some protection~
It takes 4-5 bullets, not much different from CoD .-.
indeed
but you dont instatly die from a shotgun shoot in the knee
oi those extra bullets mean ALOT
not with mps
I usually play hardcore in BF3 anyway >.>, 3 bullets kill \o/
CoD is a MP only game~
god i wish there was games w/o planes and helis though. they outright break the game sometimes
yah
lvl 100 jet flyers
Or hop over to Red Orchestra 2 and a rifleman can kill in a single shot up to ~250m away \o/
instantly rape everything
RO2 is unforgiving
indeed
<3 RO2
thats why its epic
It is pretty fun, I haven't played it in ages though
god those proxy mines are op
00,10the name seems correct
00,10who ever has it dies alot
Cod4 was the only great CoD in multiplayer for me~
aliens are officaly inside the phoens
All those mines .-.
ofc
its like mw3~
thats why i love cod4, cause nobody got heavy overpowerd stuff like this mines
sb sure dose love his handguns
Black ops 2 is great. You just prone if you hear a jumping jimmy go off.
I seriously wonder if anyone would hold a knife like that
i bet that knife felt good for sb
Wait, is BO2 on stream?
AdamTheDuck: solid snake?
SuperBrony64 STAHP
XAX: SuperBrony64 stream! :)
MadSurge: So it is?
Ayup
iam so happy that i dont waste money on CoD anymore~ i dont pay 60 for the same game every year~
/me stopped at CoD 2 :P
VioletGreySha: :D/)
Ahh the first few CoD's were classics
^^
Black ops 2 is $120 on release here. Fucking new zealand, and it's ripoff game prices.
XAX, wat.
GOD WHAT
I just bought a key for $60 and activated it on steam though.
XAX: :D
Because fuck paying $100 like my consolefag friends do.
well as i said, everything affter CoD4 in multiplayer is just damn ripoff~ they suck this series dry for money~
Oh that's right
Console still has to buy CD's XD
<3 his PC XD
/me <3 his PC XD*
CoD is mindless fun. Also, I haven't bought a single CoD since 4 either. MW3 and BO were gifted to me. Dad bought the key for BO2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i always say, people that play shooters on consoles are to bad to get a good pc~
11,02You can download most of the Wii U games off the eShop should you choose
SuperBrony64: >tfw I still owe you $20 for BO
guess what time it is
tool time?
Adventure Time? :3
dinner time im rely gonna gess though
XAX; sure cod is mindles fun but then get Sirious sam 3 and get even more mindless fun XD
I got the original second one.
same
Aight im back from my shower whew that felt good
wb
eeyup
hey SuperBrony64
Welcome back Moopy
Sirious
thanks dude
man knifes like to miss in this game
srs jaymoo, we haz srs discssn here.
Srs bsns.
if CoD turns in a better game one day again i will surely buy it~
superserius
Brack Flops 2 is great.
see when i even play that game i hate when noobs try to run a way from me thats fuckin stupid dude they need to stop doing that
breakfast time!
XAX; its like mw3 and mw3 is like mw2 and mw2 trys to be like mw1~
but heres what sucky though in combat training you can not even rank up and thats stupid as hell
yay for breakfast!
Moopy; if you want to play combat training only then you shouldnt waste so much money on it~
I wasn't wasteing money dude
Holy shit needs more tilde.
/me loves tilde~~
:'(
Needs more console key.
|
Moopy; well if you bought a game thats basicly made for multiplayer and dont play multiplayer then its a waste xD but if you just cracked it its alright for sure~
HURG twitter lag
Uh huh sure whatever dude
yes, hello
the reason i got the game i just wanted to see what weapons they have so yeah
"Basically for multiplayer" reminds me. BO2 campaign has alternate endings.
Oh boy here we go.
Sumica: damn you! I thought I hated shows where the villains are not really evil, and now I want to see how Nanoha ends :'(
Gonna need to replay one day.
incog of the GNAA here
00,10later today MadSurge
whatever do you mean, Jmo
XAX; still not more then 5 hours gameplay~ and you dont need to play trought the whole game to get the different endings ^^
Good morning Bronystate

You're funny incog.

00,10Funny haha or funny strange?
Hello Gold_Demona! :)

Funny as in pathetic.
/me has no idea what we're talking about :D
not sure, cod it seems
Heres a question for the wii U how can you even chat with a mic on the console huh?
Fire keeps going out ;__; It's too cold in here
It probably has one built in.
Or slot for headphones.
SuperBrony64 your poo
Pffffft whatever
Same way as on any other console, I imagine.

Vivix: you mean child love?
as a dangerous thing yes
Bronysith: Because love between the same gender isn't natural, and people are scared of what isn't natural. Which is stupid because it's also harmless.
am i considered a woman?
it's bad for a growing mind- but love exists in many places
or a girl?
Gold_Demona: seriously, also people now assosiate gay with bad....wtf?
Objectum Sexuality, zoophilia, homosexuality, bisexuality-
http://fav.me/d5k5azm guys please critisize
i need some
aniderp|bestcakeever: depends of the age
im 20
11,02Bronysith: Good chunk of people reason it with what they believe the bible considers it as a sin.
Vivix: i am more on the pansexual side, as longa s one day i find someone to love, being man or woman, i dont care, as long as i have someone to comfort me or me to comfort them
MadSurge: News to me. :P
SuperBrony64: inserted during translation
Bronysith, yeah~~ s a good lock
MadSurge, I don't think it counts as sex, though.
SuperBrony64!!!!!!!!!!!! GTFO AND SLEEP
NOW
11,02NO U
Gold_Demona: sightings of male lions duking it out counts? :D
To school I go
Bye~
11,02Later Ponies47, have an awesome birthday :D
that whole "Homosexuality is a sin" was easily put in during translation
i dare not tell my grandmother on my father's side
she would flip..
MadSurge: "duking it out" means they were fighting, not fucking. :D
Thanks SuperBrony64|Zzz it's already been really good so far :3
Kandarihu: nevertheless, it's a stupid thing to hate :D
theres lost in translation, mistranslated, and of course, just fucking made up
night SuperBrony64|Zzz
Gold_Demona: you not homophobic right?
Gold_Demona: :D
my brother said he would come to my wedding if i got married
isnt that special?
Bronysith: Nope.
good
Is good, yeah
well im off to class
/me grabs Vivix
aniderp|bestcakeever: aww your bro is nice :)
AWAY
/me screams
Later Bronysith!
/me has an adventure
he doesnt care who i love he just wants to see me happy i guess
aniderp|bestcakeever: so you do have a BBBFF
And my husband's not an OMG RAGE homophobe. If he is, he keeps it pretty quiet.
o_O
many people can be homophobic without being against it
like- my father said he was scared of homosexuals, because whenever someone came out to him ,it was to hit on him
Vivix: wut?
Vivix, and yet there's such a witchhunt against anyone who doesn't endorse the lifestyle.
im like a hermit in my room :\
aniderp|bestcakeever: just like certain white unicorn
There's people on both sides who are way too serious about it
That's true with any argument, really
yeah~ people should be allowed to live their life, as long as noone is being harmed, but even that is not a simple rule
I like to try and hang out in the middle. There's more understanding there.
I try, but I fail sometimes
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/12/3/9rISnJOulU6AsKifMrFExg2.jpg
I like to think I succeed for the most part. It's mostly because I hate to see people fight. =(
You always fail Vivix.
Rose`Garden, lawl
/me hugs Jmo
I also hate choosing sides...
dont you people think im sweet and nice? :>
Or choosing in general...
Choices suck.
I do, in general, hate fighting- but I like discussing, and sometimes I say stupid things if I get cought up in something I believe in
always regret it later
how will i become famous?
Be swedish, and play horror games
murrica
Ew. I know who you're referencing.
God no Vivix.
buy a knitted sweater, and practice a swedish accent
I want to hurt you.
hehe
Holy shit it's Ninjazz
im not pewdie or marzia
Jaymeow.
I mean, jaymeow!
:O Ninjazz!
Vivixz, I'm swedish and I play horror games, I'm not famous ;~;
Aww..
i already have enough trouble with english xD
Jag er inte sjuk, inte sjuk, jag är bara sveeensk
Surge!
*Jag är
:3
The thing is, any comment that goes outside of accepted norms on homosexuality gets blown way out of proportion. Like what happened with Chik-Fil-A
<,<
I'm liking the cozy fire in the stream. :>
Gold_Demona: we're still in Bronysith's bed, right?
my swedish is horrible

Gold_Demona: what did that meant again?

Dark92Enigma: what did what mean?
Havok: he put me in, honest!

Gold_Demona: YOU ANSWERED: <.<
MadSurge, I love it when you send me pictures but I'm finally making some progress organizing the hell that is my fanart folders. ;_;

Dark92Enigma: it's a shifty-eyed face.
>.>
Ninjazz: so no pics? :(
<.<
Havok: he knows it
MadSurge, only for now. Maybe when I hit the 1k left mark.
Rose`Garden: Tell me, were you born a slag, or did years of your uncle cock slapping you just get you that way?
Ninjazz: okies :<
:<
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
you know what?
Gold_Demona: like ''yeah, sure'' shifty eyes?
im gonna draw a chirstmas picture for you people
:D

Dark92Enigma: More like "ummm...."
<,< maybe >,>
Hi everypony
Dark92Enigma: This is "yeah, sure" ¬_¬
how would you liek that?
That would be cute
want a muffin Gold_Demona ?
Hiyo Imadolphin
aniderp|bestcakeever: Yes! I love muffins!
Gold_Demona: well, you know Bronysith lead us to his bed, and not the opposite, right? Havok doesn't believe me
-hands muffins-
When did I say I didn't believe you Dark92Enigma? :3
Dark92Enigma: Well, I got out of the bed, and now I'm sitting by this lovely stream fire. :D
Good morrow.

Hey Jaymo
I think it was "make it rain"
Stop it.

IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE
We cause the downpour.

Motherfucker you can never have any Milky Milk.
I'll shank you and shag your couch.
I resent that
Engaging my couch in coitus won't get you any closer to the Milky Cave.
Maybe your couch is covering the Milky Cave.
It isn't.
Don't lie.
Nou.
Meanwhile hates me
Your couch will tell me the truth.
He would never milky,,
anything of mine
Barbetos: Don't worry, he hates everyone :3
Barbetos: Yes, yes I do. Who are you again?
Just a guy. At the place.
Right, I hate the guy at the place.
You hate everything.

Someone needs some corporal punishment.

Holy shite.
FOP FOM FOO
I would be the worst Fairy Godparent.
You would.
WHO HA HA FOP FOM FOO
"I wish for a puppy" get it your fucking self.
/me sings the song of the bronystate people "WHO HA HA FOP FOM FOO"
Quickly. Equip the grass skirts
My passport doesn't say Bronystate.
This is going to take a while. FOP FOM FOOO
/me forgot what she was going to say
WHO HA HA FOP FOM FOO
was that it?
I thought the song of Bronystate was "HUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUE"
There are many songs
You mean "Toottoottoottootoot"
La La La La La Laaaa, La la la la la la. Bom bom Bom.
RBRBRBRBBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/f0ca9f2615ec172ca487fb3cee1ecec2.png Meanwhile would do this too
I probably would.
I think many of us would be tempted to
I could never see Meanwhile in a pink outfit like that though.
I am sure he would against rainbow horse.
It's not pink but close enough? http://i.imgur.com/X3Gow.jpg
Hah
I could just kiss that stache.
Meanwhile: :D smashing!
Stop thinking about butt fun.
Yes I am talking to you.
It's not secret. There's no problem.
Barbetos: my bad...
Ninjazz: it's not even scary
Damnit
MadSurge, but still fun.
My coffee is ruined.
YOU FAILED.
Now I want a proper cup of tea.
/me throws popcorn in the air
And that is the only reason my coffee is ruined. It brewed great.
It's ruined because you wanted some tea?
I could just maul Jmo to death for that! =D
Perfect vengeance! :D
and thus, peace was made
Can we like, stop trying to kill each other?
That's no fun.
Hmmm... << Hrmmm.... >>
AssaultWithEmbraces: I could never do that to you! D:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwjBVggZT1o
te he he he he
I broke da rulez.
I dunno who is streaming anyways
Who wants a flugelhorn?
Oh no one
I feel dum
Its just a you tube vidja
Barbetos: in a loop
Yep
It is very loopy
That video I linked... Reminds me of the days before youtube.
So much chaos.
I look away
I look back
and I see nothing of interest
Hay Jmo
Hay Fluffeh
/me hugs Jmo
/me huggles AssaultWithEmbraces
Woo, free hugs!
AssaultWithEmbraces: I want a flugelhorn! :D
Time to get naked and clean.
Shower time!
Yaaay~
/me hugs everypony
/me throws a flugelhorn in MadSurge's direction
Ew hugs. My weakness.
/me hugs Ninjazz
Hugs me in all my nakedness
/me hugs Ninjazz more :3
I would hug me too
/me plays the flugelhorn horribly
Go back to smacking me with fish, Jaymeow.
You too Demona.
But I don't smack people with fish. O_o
Then use your bananas.
Ehehehehehe
But Ninjazz, you are mah fwiend :( *hugs*
I keep trying to turn the fish into banans, but then Mojay finds moar feesh. o_O
ARGH.
bananas even XD
He is a crazy fisherman.
Ninjazz: I will throw all Rarities I can find at you! :D
Yay.
Much much better than gestures of affection.
So.....how's everyone doing?
good
sorta just lounging now

Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 2 days, 0 hours, 43 minutes, 8 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
Pointing fingers never helps.
Jmo: but I have class!
I don't care.
but, but...myuh...
That's what I thought.
/me doesn't even anymore
<:
You know, capslock can be rearranged into cockslap
I can now sleep at night knowing that, thank you.
no. just....no
my brain exploded upon realizing that
And boobytrap spelled backwords spells partyboob.
backwards*
Not the only thing that exploded.
HOHOHO
oh you
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/961886831f62396feab092979ff637c7.png Oh my, a true unicorn!
MadSurge: Needs more pink
AssaultWithEmbraces: :D
and hearts
And balloons
never go wrong with hearts
And bouncy pink hair
oh look, the cleansing power of fire
And blood.
Everywhere.
:>
you're adorable, jaymoo
I know right.
<3
o u <3
\:3/
You just lost it all making that face.
I hope you are happy.
videokamin.de.... so there's a whole site with the sole purpose of filming chimney fires
huh
Oh, bg fire
Eyo ponies
Jmo: I ish happeh
Hey Hoody|Skool!
that fire absolutely works......it keeps me warm to my hooves
Hi Hoody|Skool
Technically Shizu never stopped streaming
AssaultWithEmbraces: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/308b0ebad95f9dfa57b8662ff7185816.jpg <3
Awww, Pinkie <3
HNNG
/me dies
/me revives Hoody|Skool
/me sings I will survive
Time to go to class
Pinkie makes everything instantly better (when she's not wreaking havoc)
laters all
Bye Sylandest.
AssaultWithEmbraces: Ikr :D
latas Sylandest
now imagine that picture with fluttershy
Bai Syl
bai bai
was nice knowing ya
Dark_Horst: That picture with fluttershy, but drinking a milkshake as well as a filly
and that's how you kill a man with his own mind
:>
Shoulda stayed home today :S
You okay, Hoody|Skool?
Don't feel good
Poor diddums.
Hello, everypony! ...Which one of you stole the popcorn?
/me munches on something... suspicious. >_>
What popcorn? <_<
/me slaps Gold_Demona around a bit with a large trout
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large banana
That what's he gets for stealing MY popcorn!
he?
Undefined.
he who?
Your mother is a slag Meanwhile.
yer mom's a slag
Nuh-uh Mayjoo, yer ma is the slag.
Are you startin', Mojay? >.>
I don't start till I hit the bedroom.
Success.
I like the sideshow...but atlas, with an more powerful stream that never lags, we lays the buffer show to eternal rest.
wut
Meanwhile, can you understand that?
I don't think that was actually a sentence.
Neither do I.
I do, but there's tons of errors :D
Ugh, it's fancy saying for R.I.P Buffer Show.
^
Fancy?
You silly intelligence amuses me, silly ponies!
It was like...you put a lot of words onto little strips of paper, then threw them everywhere and read them off as you picked them up again.
*alas *a
*lay
I'm not the perfect spelling bee, okay? =C
Poor VenHur
I miss the buffer show. we never found out if The Duke of Veemi actually went with Lady Mips.
Right, MadSurge?
:D
Turns out Lady Mips was banging her brother and they had an ugly child who became king.
/me pokes Meanwhile
Meanwhile: Was his name Livestream?
The scandals that followed!
Yes, yes it was.
Meanwhile: are you one of the Game of Thrones series' writers? :D
Meanwhile his cousin Ustream seeks to overthrow his reign.
If I were it'd be nothing but "The Adventures of Tyrion Lannister"
But what happened to Sir LimeV?
Because fucking hell that midget is amazing.
Meanwhile: the imp? he's awesome! :D
"Those are brave men knocking at our door....let's go kill them!"
Sir LimeV was roasted in the fireplace last Thanksgiving.
The poor laddie was burned inside the keetle.
You can't trust wheels
And the two boxes that incessantly taunt it
That, and flat tires...
Where's that pic that explains why Trixie hates wheels?
I think MadSurge linked it the other day.
It was Trixies marefriend in bed with a wheel
Gold_Demona: and the refresh button that always menaces to crash the universe and restart everything
3 ponies just went through my mind
Who was it?
MadSurge: Yes, that dreaded refresh button! D:
The refresh button is my greatest weapon against the dreaded stream embed
But then the buffer show will end. :<
Or start over
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/8edb807d9c4a4e03bc8675029461cfd8.png :3c
I'm confused now.
Eh, I got tired of that show after the 4th season, it never really developed
I guess it did kind of go downhill after they brought in the two boxes. =/
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/97fdb50ff1adefa929d0885a549e912c.png *faceplant*
So I guess "Trixie hates wheels" is a meme?
Peoples sleeping on a 24/7 stream site?
AssaultWithEmbraces: apparently
*punches them* NOPE
/me licks VenHur
00,02refresh your streams
No.
*Miserable cat face.*
Awww, no more fireplace. :<
Phase4: There be nothin there
hey
Hi
Phase4: I keep trowing my money everytime I refreshed, but nothing happened.
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_BL5EKwSqE fireplace :P
oh now theres something on the stream
00,02should see the ustream embed
Wohoo, slideshow!
We need more mod pics
Yey! *goes to fireplace link*
whoops i closed the browser by accident
If I wanted fire I'd just set something aflame
Or light my own fireplace
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNJJ-QkZ8cM
Phase4: You wanna join me on VS Ponyville? :3
So is anything going to show up or should I turn my youtube video back on?
/me throws a cuccoo in the chat
Turn your youtube video back on.
00,02Havok, i ragequit earlier today after i once again lost my go as hale due to server lag
Watch paint dry
00,02its INCERDIBLY anoying
I do not have this place of fire. So I have to make do with a fake one. :D
"Incerdibly"
00,02Meanwhile, quiet you
Ermahgerd
5,2,3,2,1
incerdibly errneying
Rofl.
00,02there is a video underneath the ad
._.
00,02but ustream hates ponies
frick
00,02(i turned off my adblock so i can see what you guys see)
HOOROROROROR
00,02ok, ustream, when you show me the same ad twice it doesnt make me want to buy things twice as much
HAX ME
00,02infact all it does is make me hate you
Trixie was scouting ponyville with clones
Phase4: Damn it, Phase, why you no had AdBlock?!
Y DO YOU HAVE TO USE USTREAM NOW?
Because Mips broke
I KNOW THAT BUT WHY NOT USE LIMEV OR VEMMI?
00,02jbh1145, mips has security problems
Because everything else failed.
00,02they don't have autoplay
00,02also they suck
And at some point, this will fail too.
And the cycle will complete.
Twitch?
Meanwhile: Then what will you do?
00,02twitch is gaming only iirc
Havok: Twitch hates Chrome and Safari
00,02either twitch or justin
i gtg
00,02either way, limited in what you can stream
00,02also the iframe problem
Watch something on youtube? It's not like I'd be missing much nowadays.
00,02"cant load twitch.tv in a frame" why? no idea, they just complain
Stream why u buffer so much
Is it weird that I eat coughdrops like candy?
Yes.
Hoody|Skool: Nope
Sweet
I'm different :3
I don't think that's good for you. O_o
Just like everyone else.
Hoody|Skool: I eat Ricola like it's going out of style
A pack is gone under an hour
Meanwhile: You're dour
Dour?
I chew gum like crack
AssaultWithEmbraces: I eat lemon flavored digestive all the time :D it's fizzy!
MadSurge: ooooooh
Dour
00,02stream working ok?
00,02ffmpeg is behaving wierd here
Yeah I'm pretty dour.
im back
You weren't missed.
i know
Good.
/me gives jbh1145 a "welcome back" muffin. :>
Pinkie Pie now bears Fluttershy's element.
Jaymoo go discourage someone else
YOUR ARGUEMENT IS INVALID
argument*
VenHur: You're on fire
Hoody, how about you actually go learn something in school
i hope ustream isnt always this laggy
I would if there was something to learn
I can imagine there is alot you need to learn.
Discord stoles the Element of Honesty...
O_O
Dat face.
Dat face...
GOD
This guy really has nothing to do all day
:) ]
WELCOME TO THE JAM
i think thats what there saying>
Come on and slam
And welcome to the jam!
Na na na na na!
This game is canon
MAGIC FREAKING KINDERGARDEN
Is there buffer for anyone else?
Frame by frame analysis
A lot :(
Oh, so it's not just me
:[ :[
Magic Kindergarden = Proof that there's a MUCH worse schoolhouse then Sonic's.
Yes, Sonic had an educational game.
<VenHur> wait? im not the only one who knows about that game?
UMAD?
HI GIRRRLLLSSS
i know about that
ohai everyone
Wb ekips!
DAT BLINK
oi ekips, what be up
jbh1145: I know that trainwreck too...and my god...It was terrible...
YEP
MadSurge oh right, I was already here
IT MAKES SONIC 06 LOOKS LIKE ET
Hoody|Skool not much, just came back from the dentist
Sonic 06 needs to be put out of its misery. >.>
i mean IT MAKES SONIC 06 LOOK LIKE MARIO GALAXY
THING
Sonic itself probably should kick the bucket.
Along with its rival.
POSSIBLE
WORST
THE
ekips: You poor creature
gnah, stream, why you die on me?
plz dont tell me ustream is always this laggy
Ok, I won't tell you.
00,02its probably the thing i was trying to ask you about before :P
jbh1145 usually not
00,02when i asked if the stream was ok
00,02but no one responded :<
i actually seems better now
Make a Sonic HD Collection (Think of Sonic 2 HD, only NOT cancelled) = My life is now complete.
DERPY
dat crowd
sonic 2 hd= life complete
Too bad it was cancelled...
sega could contiune it :D
assss long as they dont give it to dimps
SONIC 2, NOW WITH 80% MORE STICKING ON WALLS
I played the crap out of Sonic 2 and Sonic 3 & Knuckles as a kid. :>
dat !
AND 99.99999999% LESS MOMENTUM
Those two are still my top favorite Sonic games.
back and BLOOPERS!!!!!!!!
GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Grapes. Carrot
At least Sonic Generations wasn't made from Dimps...otherwise, we could of had a MUCH worse game than 06 that will made us raises pitchforks and stabs SEGA.
thank god generations was as good as it is
I really liked Sonic Generations.
I'd like to know how some of these mistakes could sneak into the show
no great as it is, no AWESOME, OUTSANDTING, AMAZING!
VenHur: there's a really funny Sonic 06 let's play on youtube
MadSurge: Oh, I loved the great Clement on Youtube.
ekips, it probably happens when the episode is finished and it looks fine when they go over it in Flash. Flash is a finnicky program when it wants to be
oh yea clements review was beast
VenHur: no, I'm talking about PokeCapn
VenHur: I used to like Clement until he started getting WAY too angry and insulting towards his audience.
MadSurge: Never heard of PokeCapn, but i'll give him a shot.
I kinda liked Brainscratch's let's play of Sonic 06, but Lewis is WAY too whiney.
:S
yea brainscrath is awesome too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCwwxCL4iyw
VenHur: it's like six people in one apartment suffering through it all :D
Clement is still okay with me, screw the general haters and amok.
lol
AssaultWithEmbraces well, since I've no clue about Flash, I just believe you ;)
I prefer Johnny's standalone Let's Play of Sonic 06 that he did recently.
VenHur: that final level is pure garbage btw
stream laggy for someone else?
ekips: I've had a class in Adobe Flash and it's temperamental. Sometimes it'll coopperate with you, other times it just hisses at you for no reason.
VenHur: Clement has a tendency to dwell on an argument and make it drag for WAY longer than it has to...
Aside from Crisis City, I never really cared about the other levels, cause they're forgetable and unnostalgic.
WTF
But at least the music sounds good.
AM LAGGING
BADLY
00,02yeah, things are breaking here
...I think I'm seeing a pattern here, no matters if X6 and X7 were really bad games, the music are some of the best in the series.
VenHur: the level with the one hit kill blackholes that appeared randomly
Same with Sonic 06 and others.
Phase4 what's happening?
Phase4: u busy?
00,02ffmpeg cant communicate with ustream
00,02no idea how or why
00,02its gradually streaming slower and slower, resulting in more and more lag
i actually have never played 06 and i was actually thinking about trying it but after watching clements review i completely changed my mind
Phase4 I hope you'll figure out what's wrong :>
Phase4: am a premuim
Phase4, why you no bread yet? :|
Go to bread young man.
wanna know an underrated sonic game? sonic heroes
Games just arn't fun anymore.
i hate it when people say it sucks, its my first sonic game
I've never played Sonic Heroes, so I can't make a fair judgement on it. I hear mixed opinions about it. =/
I also hear that Sonic Colors is a good game, but only if you get the console version.
jbh1145, Touhou 10: Mountain of Faith was the first Touhou game I ever played. Most of the veteran Touhou players hate that game. But it turned me on to the whole series.
<Gold_Demona> it is
Kandarihu: so what's your current favorite Touhou game?
i played pretty much every sonic game expect for sonic 06
MadSurge, I don't know.
I'd never even heard of Touhou until people started talking about it in this chat. O_o
Gold_Demona: it's Japan's equivalent of Ponies :D it looks kiddish but has a ton of fans! The games though are definitely not for kids
heh
I know of every single Sonic games known to the public, even Sonic Eraser!
VenHur: what about that arcade game where Sonic must escape a death course?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Pokemans Pink / It's Also About.. / Derpy's Wish / Mystery Solved / Off the Charts
i stopped paying attention after sonic 3 and knuckles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cEBbvZr5F8
yes! Ponies and superjail!
MadSurge: SegaSonic The Hedgehog? Yeah, I know that game, I was so depressed that it didn't made into Sonic Gems Collection, nor Knuckles Chaotix.
Apparently Chaotix wasn't a gem, but Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine was. :D
Oh, and Sonic Shuffle is NOT a clone of Mario Party, because it was ALSO made by Hudsoft.
Though, it's true, the game sucks story-wise, but the gameplay wasn't THAT bad.
I has a strawberry-vanilla lollipop :3
Ooh MadSurge :3
AssaultWithEmbraces: lollipops are good :3
They're delicious.
Makes you feel like a kid again
lollipop lollipop lolli lolli.. arrrgh

AssaultWithEmbraces: bah I'm bored and at home you don't see me in a grumpy mood do you? :)
otakon: Not yet :3
this is the INTERNET
seriously there is SOMETHING here to alleviate boredom
Fluttershy is the absolute worst pony and she has no character.
Meanwhile: No she isn't :3
AssaultWithEmbraces is best pony
What a useless piece of shit.
Meanwhile: you love Trixie
:>
I hope they remove her in season 4.
Meanwhile: you want ot have a happy family of foals with her
Unlike you otakon I'm not inclined to fuck horses.
Meanwhile: and have her moustache touch yours :3
Meanwhile: I don't know who you're speaking to, potato's have no love of horses :3
Go die potato.
Bah I'll be hash browns one day
But not today.
You do that face one more time and you won't have one.
:3
Today you are Pedospud, groper of the innocent.
:3
Yeah you're gonna get it later.
The Cat and the Wallaby walk into a bar and threaten a potato
This is going to be the worst punchline.
well that's the thing
there is no punch line
so it's even WORSE
What...what did i walk in to?
Nothing
BladedWings: randomness
and stuff
Hey otakon, do you think you could stop being so chipper? It's a real downer.
BladedWings: a fight between a Wallaby and a Cat inbetween a potato.
Hohoho.
Meanwhile: go hug your OTP :3
Ah, sence...this chat makes a lot of it XD
sense*
BladedWings: nah not really
damnit
You realise karma is gonna bite your ass later.
thank you Meanwhile
You're welcome.
Jmo: how so? I'm already a pedo potato dwarf on fire that's french
Oh it'll get worse.
Jmo: WHAT MORE COULD BE DONE?
Just you wait.
Jmo: bah you scare me not Aussie
It is written that otakon is limitless meme potential.
Oh. I just came up with the best idea.
Oh?
or "Oi"
Did a dingo steal your baby?
You're gonna become Chirpy.
lol no
lolyes.
how the hell do you figure that?
Just you wait.
yeah uh huh
wait
you're gonna shop my face on the bird aren't you?
-_____________- well doesn't matter you've only got one screen capture of it and it's not even the bad one so :P
Who said I was gonna do it?
You'll get Panda to
or Neil
considering everything else I've been shopped with
you still have to get the screen capture
and that's not happening any time soon
otakon x shopping.
and the shipping has commenced
I guess FedEx is open for business?
otakon x Shy`
otakon shipping? still?
Business is booming already.
she's married Jmo
Like that'll stop you.
yeah well unlike like you Blunder from Down Under I have standards
Dem standards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cEBbvZr5F8
Meanwhile, can you guess them?
otakon's standards?
Mhmm
Pregnant. Mammoth mammories.
Thos're the only requirements.
hey
stop that
Some standards you've got potato.
PG13 chat remember?
Could be a bear for all he cares, if it's pregnant with huge boobs it's a-ok.
Meanwhile: no
Oh my sides.
Again i leave for a little bit, come back, and we are talking about otakon shipping with a pregnate bear? 6_9
yeah no
we're moving no before I do wake up a mod
BladedWings: remember, randomness of chat
Hey hey, it's his standards.
Gotta respect them.

GilDash: :D oh you~
not even in passing
Hai gil
00,10I am sure there is alot of shows out there we all can say we have never heard of
it must of been made very recently
Sumica: did the guy that made Nadesico make this?
00,10could be
Sumica: dude I mean NEVER heard fo this at ALL
00,10the style seems the same
Chrysalis: Holla! :)

00,10I want a PC that can do that
o i will
LOL

O.o

00,10last ep she rewrote the flight computer of a shipe while trying to fly it
Sumica: yikes
sigh amine logic is so outthere
yikes
7 light days = 70 days? doesn't seem right
00,10it dont?
okay
how much distance can light cover in 24 hours?
A light day is just the distance light travels in a day, similar to a light year.
so whats this show about
it's like mm to meters in terms of light day to light year
woah what?
light 3000000km/s
Considering it travels at 3x10^8 m/s (that figure may be wrong), probably a lot.
light days is distance
:P
that's all
00,10only mesurement I realy recalled was AU's
not time measurement
@stream becuz
Sumica: astronomical units?
00,10and that was only cause EVE used it as a distance mesurment

00,10big hole

This anime is kinda awkward...
00,10suddnly appliances

The animation itself is pretty good.
And the music is cool.
suddenly ninja
I dunno Max, it looks fine.
But I'm extremely confused.
suddenly ninja
Hang on, lemme get someone on to help you.
00,10it's only ep 3
Aight
This is episode 3?
il think about it some more thanks Jmo :)
Wow.

xD
/me just logged on
and write it down
Ah, this is a 26-episode anime.
I hate everything about it. Does that help?
Kinda , yeah
:P
then i can remake it :P
MaxTheBrony: if i would do that, it wouldnt be just art related
welp-
jk
:)
the angle is a bit steep on your perspective, his uh furthest away hind-leg seems a bit too small for it-
Yeah , that leg :s its hard as f' to get it look good
Howdy y'all!
Heya Everlasting_Joy :)
and thus i think i should go with an other pose
Heya Everlasting_Joy !
draw his skeleton, it should be a bit closer and more eh
how are things Everlasting_Joy
Hi Everlasting_Joy
Howdy MLP_Brovakiin, MaxTheBrony and AssaultWithEmbraces!
00,10back leg seems too small for perspective and ears seem too low
This isn't really my kind of anime...
his flank on the furthest should be a bit more emphasized to match the other hindleg
alexxm: So far so-so. I have a project I'm hoping to finish up or nearly finish up to do today :(.
