and we had school uniform too
i hate uniforms
Hey everypony!

hardly, the pvp is very good there
You could just go buy gw2 if you want rpg pvp
or at least it used to be, idk how it is now
he thinks he eat it now
I never liked this joke
WoW is considered the best mmorpg, why would i want to play gw

that whole "Homosexuality is a sin" was easily put in during translation
i dare not tell my grandmother on my father's side
she would flip..
theres lost in translation, mistranslated, and of course, just fucking made up
my brother said he would come to my wedding if i got married
isnt that special?
good
Is good, yeah
AWAY
/me screams
/me has an adventure
And my husband's not an OMG RAGE homophobe. If he is, he keeps it pretty quiet.
o_O
many people can be homophobic without being against it
like- my father said he was scared of homosexuals, because whenever someone came out to him ,it was to hit on him
well we dont talk much.. but he does come home for holidays like chirstmas
I like to try and hang out in the middle. There's more understanding there.
I try, but I fail sometimes

The scandals that followed!
Yes, yes it was.
If I were it'd be nothing but "The Adventures of Tyrion Lannister"
The poor laddie was burned inside the keetle.
But really ALL of that is just a subplot. The REAL story is the epic adventure of the wheel that perpetually chases its tale
You can't trust wheels
And the two boxes that incessantly taunt it
That, and flat tires...
Where's that pic that explains why Trixie hates wheels?

00,10it dont?
okay
how much distance can light cover in 24 hours?
A light day is just the distance light travels in a day, similar to a light year.
it's like mm to meters in terms of light day to light year
light 3000000km/s
Considering it travels at 3x10^8 m/s (that figure may be wrong), probably a lot.
:P
that's all
00,10only mesurement I realy recalled was AU's
not time measurement

and write it down
I hate everything about it. Does that help?
Kinda , yeah

and thus i think i should go with an other pose
draw his skeleton, it should be a bit closer and more eh
This isn't really my kind of anime...
his flank on the furthest should be a bit more emphasized to match the other hindleg
