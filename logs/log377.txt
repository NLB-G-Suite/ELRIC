derpy: There is *some* strategy.
11,01I think we might lock down this channel.
11,01And do preventative bans.
Actually IMDb says it started in 1966
08,01i love how you all feel so important now
bue ThatsAShinySky and MegaMuffins
well it's a Broadway show on his own life
11,01Meaning ban the bot namws.
lol
so Star Trek will be a big part of it
You know what every mod says? They say... THOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!
CK|Asleep: for a seasoned chess player there is no real strategic depth in this
i suggest putting it on lockdown until its overwith
inb4 non-bots getting banned
brony wasnt hacked was it? im there right now
no
there is another bot attack
i hate bots
derpy: For a seasoned chess player, there is no strategic depth to any video game.
That's a false comparison. >_>

i feel like wearing a mlp shirt to school
LoL 88%
Go for it
i wear uniform :'(
so...last night I watched an anime called "Eiken".
i would pony_7733 and my school enforces uniform
Dat hero vs hero >.,

uniforms suck
glad i dont have them
i know
and i cant even fing a pony t shirt :'(
find *
hot topic has them
thats why i wear what i want
Dont even bring up the uniforms for girls in japan >_>
Note to EVERYPONY: Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, watch Eiken.
I ordered a bunch of shirts online
Eiken?
ive heard of that one
whats eiken
inb4 everypony looks it up
What's Eiken?
Rawrity : BIG BOOOOOOOOBIES
inb4 I totally DCd
parents wont let me get shirts online :'(
That's nine 'evers'... that's like... forever!
RAWRity was is das?
RainbowJack: those...THINGS on those girls' chests are nat boobs. Boobs to not more or function like that.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiken_(manga)
/me doesn't want to know
Paradise92: the closest thing we've gotten to replicating pure evil in the universe.
gasp those boobs are huge
RAWRity: your right there like ZZ cup
oh rlly?
Oh that crazy Japan
Paradise92: THAT RAN FOR 40 VOLUMES?
hentai?
Close
echii
Nope, not hentai. damn close, but no actual porn.
what the hay, those boobs are bigger than their heads
theres probably rule 34 of it though
05ok back
Oh japan~

If you want to know WHY Eiken is the worst thing ever, just watch this: http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/ir/jo/jar/29103-eiken-with-sage
id better hehe check if there is hehe so none of us runs into it hehe
I never quite understood manga girls with ginormous boobs. It strikes me as too odd to really be attractive

Japan has a thing for all sexual related things

TWILIGHT!!
Jim :D
its not even powerful enough to see play in vintage
I haven't played magic the gathering
seriously, compare this to tarmogoyf and goyf wins straight out
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
well guys and gals, I just managed to draw a pony without using any kind of references... what do you think?
twlight is a mouth?
trollestia: Only to a limited degree. TOR is basically a refined WoW, and Rift only dented WoW.
oh okay
Indian Stallone.
CountDoofus: you got the little thing on their hind legs going the reverse direction
Pretty cool CountDoofus
twilight sparkle in wow
what is twilight doing there??
nice pony, CountDoofus
Nice CountDoofus :)
Twilight Sparkle is best Warlock
no, she is a mage
trixie is a warlock
/me spots the twilight walking across the screen "So awesome!"
Dat Twi. :D
Did someone say Indian Stallone? http://derpy.me/XnZZF
i am bored
/me hugs trollestia "i missed you"
Entertain me!
I know, the hind legs are soemwhat off, and not very thrilled about the mane and tail too
trollestia: nah....trixie is a mage. So OP that everyone hates her
but other than that, I can be pretty happy about it, no?
CountDoofus: it still looks pretty good
i'm not joking what is twilight doing there???

/me is wearing the brony t-shirt and the Celestia/Twilight plush throw
>_<
hemorrhoids really? or is that a player name for something?
if hasbro keeps taking mlp off youtube they're going to the sun.
World of Warcraft = The most cluttered MMORPG in existance.
00,10Player name for somthing
^
is there a rarity pony thing?
like companion
^@trollestia
probably
Oh okay Sumica would be terrible if that was the official name
05its cluttered cause im runnign a lower res
i despise WoW
I see.
Hm. It's a bit disappointing that you're not having to move to avoid the giant dragon's attacks....sort of detracts for me, but perhaps I'm spoiled from watching too much footage of The Shatterer. Still pretty cool.
00,10less talkie more tankie
/me takes the puppies out
sorry guys, what game is it????? it's cool <3
at school yesterday i saved a fellow brony
00,10He's the tank he's no supposed to move =p
fluttershyfan158: how?
pony_1154: This is World of Warcraft
Would your computer crash if you turned on Desktop Ponies and placed 50 of every pony?
how fluttershyfan?
Sumica: Sorta my point. XD
Ordinary human is able to tank against massive continent-spanning dragon. :p
Just seems weird.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taqCqv6fgq4
he was being bullied by a non brony who was calling him gay and the kid started crying so i got up and punched the kid in the face!! i got sent to the office and i didn't get punished u know why?
I know it's pretty normal for MMOs, just seems odd in context.
THE PRINCEPAL WAS A BRONY TOO!!
00,10well te be fair he's just attacking the toe nails as he's trying to climb out of a interdemnitonal vortex
ah ok thanks
wow, you're awesome fluttershy the world needs more people like you.
fluttershyfan158: bad that you required violence but still good you did something to stand up
/me bursts into flames
I haven't met a brony in my school yet.
fluttershyfan158: well done none the less
i can only ''love and tolerate'' to a point!!
Sumica: Sure, but even the toenails are bigger than him
Also why are there tentacles?
o.o
now the kid is walking around with a black eye
00,10shame, they called wipe it up
fluttershyfan158: how un-manly will he sound when he tells his parents 'i got a black eye for saying ponies are gay'
00,10and they are also being supported by the dragon aspects
i asked the princapal who his favorite pony is
he said applejack
Soarin' d00h
i remember deathwing from Warcraft 2... he wasn't anywhere like his is in WoW
/)flutershyfan158
awesome story fluttershyfan158
Ponies
brohoof? (\
00,10this version of deathwing is after he escaped his prision
principal of junior high, high school?
middle school

Brony principal is best principal
ikr

2,028?
wow, wrek.
traceurelements
LOLOOL
and Wrek, that Twilight drawing? I just saw it for a fraction of a seconds, but I want it against my wall

fluttershyfan158: Nope. I don't socialize much.

Uhm, let's not talk about those kinds of fanfics..
05what i lack in looks i make up for in cunning

Rain!!
Byte: Sounds like a girl I know. She just broke up with a boyfriend of 2 years, and says she needs a bit more time. But she specified that she did not want to friendzone me.
She's also an aspiring writer and artist.

Personally i like flat chests better
^^
And hello Twilight
Like the girl I'm going after is beautiful, hot as hell, specified that she doesn't want to friendzone me, goes on 4chan, and is a pegasister. AWWWWW YEAH
...walking on the screen there...

I need to ask her for her DA account.
She's an amazing artist.

It looks like you cant really play WoW alone can you?
You can play WoW alone, but you'll miss out on a lot of content
You can, but if your raiding as you see here, then it will require help

/me thinks he's bluffing
TOY_PON3 how does L4D2 run on your computer?
/me wishes he had an alienware 18x inch laptop
/me does not know much about computers
i concur to that hazard
>alienware
>mfw
Screw alienware
alienware is what made Portal 2 possible
well some of it
Hazard: PFFT.
You don't know crap about computers
I'd be up for a game of L4D if anyone else is
Lol
HURR DURR, ALIENWARE R SO GUD

Oh I see where watching L4D~
Dey'z shiny n look purty

>Implying alienwares have more functionality than normal PCs
System for a down. <3
The stupid. I can smell it
of a down*
DELL is a baby compared to Alienware
I love Dell comps
id like to be a tree
Hazard: >2012
>Not building your own computer
FalconNorthwest and Alienware are the top two best on my charts
captain falconNorthwest?
hi Dashie_Dashie
no
Hazard: I build computers. I'm not a retard who pays out the ass to have a company put together some parts in a crappy shiny case for me. Anybody who does that is a moron.
:3
:(
Hazard: DELL is computers for the masses alienware is performance gaming, they design the computers for different things
11,01Uh oh. Lagging.
true
but im a gamer
ohai TOY_PON3
11,01Might have to close my music.
and i didnt ask you TwoFive
ugh oh
D:
HURR DURR I R GAMER. I UZE ALIENWARE CUZ ALIENWARE R BEST BECAUSE DEY BEST
you're music is awesome though.
11,01My CPU usage is running 60% - 80%
you spelt use wrong :3
o_O
Nittany_Discord: Are we starting from the first chapter?
HURR DURR HOW DO I BUILD MY OWN COMPUTER
twofive i dont care for you opinion and less about what you do
11,01Yep.
K
Hazard as am i (a gamer that is) and i use neither dell of alien, what i have is a frankenstein :p
Hazard: You're 12, aren't you?
TOY_PON3 how does this run on your computer in comparison to TF2?
KwakLad: Same here. That's the most cost-effective way to go.
coz I wanna buy it ._.
14 TwoFive and prefer it if you did NOT call me a retard
Dashie_Dashie: It runs great
TwoFive well said too
Coach is flying?~
OK, seriously? too hostile in chat.
glitched coach
Isnt this game on ps3 and 360 anyways?
yeah
pc is better though
Hazard: I call 'em like I see 'em. Lol. It's like saying macs are better because they're shiny
gorden freeman crowbar :D
please mellow out
PC > consoles
PC master race
Macs suck
I like consoles better
<3 PC
00,03Console fanboy here!
05sigh
Hazard: Okay, so you aren't entirely retarded
AMIGA WORKBENCH FOR LIFE
00,03Haters gon hate
05for the last time macs doesnt suck
XBOX FTW!
although beggars cant be choosers i just want my fucking PC back
wait what?
00,03bronyfan /)
Lol Wrek, suddenly.
05its all depending on what you want from your computer
Thank you
05stop that bloody fanboi trollin'
Hazard: Build your own PC. I'm pretty sure your parents will appreciate paying less.
I agree Wrek macs dont suck, the problem i have is that they are disproportionally expensive
Scoot-Scootaloo I used to be a console fanboy like you but then I realised that little kids are fucking annoying and trolling them gets boring.
dousnt sound like it will cost less
Kwaklad: Agreed.
Xbox, but i never put forth the effort to branch out, so i don't have opinions on PS3 or PC
What is so bad about consoles?
05first time building comp: might be expensive casue you invest in OS n such aswell
Hazard: You are approaching full retard. Seriously.
u cant mod
If apple actually does release some high dpi models I'm going to have to buy one.
00,03Yeah well, when you have a paperwieght of a laptop and a Mac, you don't have much choice...
05then each time it gets cheaper and lasts longer
and software
Wrek: >Implying it's not easy as hell to pirate Windows 7 Ultimate
Lol
I'm tired of being stuck with 1080P.
I still think consoles are better
Wrek, I've found you in the internet.. http://i.imgur.com/tfvXs.png
or was software under the 'and such'?
TwoFive do i fucking look like i can build a PC from scratch?
05TwoFive there are honest people out there, I cater to them. i know its easy as fuck to pirate.
settle down, everyone, shall we? you don't want to risk a kick or ban over a stupid dispute, do you?
00,03By the way, good afternoon, everypony!
Id bbuild my own pc if i could
Hazard: A child could do it.
afternoon Scoot-Scootaloo
who won the lotto?
me
afternoon Scoots
i wish
A+B movies please
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
TwoFive with an instruction manual? if theres that i could do it
Serenity and Space Mutiny, MrChang
really, why mess with pirating a windows OS, when it's just as easy to get something liek Ubuntu or Mint for free?
damn
i seem to never win =\
Hazard: It's simple as hell. It's like legos. It's so easy chinese laborers who are like 5 and work for FoxConn making macs can do it
Hazard: You don't need a manual.
cool, i liked Serenity... never heard of space mutiny though
What were you wishing for?
hey now
I bought Win7 Pro for $30.
watch it, twofive
Lol
Space Mutiny's got a 1.9 on IMDB
MrChang: It's true.
we should watch the series Firefly this week =P
then how am i supposed to build it from scratch if i dont know where the right peices go? im not a god damn expert
its not 5
its at least 10
jeez
13keep in mind imdb scores are user generated, not critics
Hazard: Neither was I, but I did it.
i got win7 ulti edition for free
05>implyign you got to be an expert
wow
^
come at me, krakass
now your just fucking trolling me
Hazard, there are instructions on the web, but for the most part its plug and play.
13i think space mutiny will be fun cause it's campy turned up to 12
Just download Windows 7 from TPB guys
05ive built a total of 14 computers
Hazard: you dont need to be an expert... computers are actually really simple to put together
05each time it gets easier and cheaper
I've built 5
MrChang, huh?
>implying that i'm implying because that's implying someone implying.
My first was easy.
>wat
Hazard: Are you like 10 or something?
I have built 7
00,03I built a lego clock, does that count?
Ive built many computers (most not mine tho :()
putting together a computer isn't very difficult
L
its just tedious
00,03and a lego robot!
How is Hazard being an idiot?
You don't have to be an expert, but if you're not educated on the basic hardward of a computer, then yeah, not the best idea to try and build your own. If you've got a tech savvy friend who's willing to help, then talk to them first.
It's easy as hell
TwoFive: you have been fucking trolling me for 20 minutes telling me a retard
05buildign a lego clock is more complicated that putting a comp together
Scoot-Scootaloo::D
/me hugs Shizuka "IDK why but I feel like I have to tell you how much I love you"
Lol!!!
im god damn sick and fucking tired of it
lego=/=round
=(
Hazard: >telling me a retard
Lol
ive helped put together about 5 comps... taken apart 10 times as many though, so i have a good understanding
Computer's really don't see complicated at all to build.
I know its not difficult I was just saying there are instructions online if you need them.
/me brohoofs Scoot-Scootaloo
TwoFive i did not call you a retard you just did it yourself
Kudos to u
Computers are easy as hell to build
05TwoFive quit torlling, Hazard stop being butthurt.
05or ill get rid of both of you
im not butthurt :P
What's a drama?
:o
thx, Wrek]
Considering computers are now effectly modular and designed to be easilly constructable, i mean they even have words next to some ports/slots telling you what they are for
im just telling it the way it is
13wrek has to break up the schoolground fights
Jim, your a filly and what is this?
lego doesnt have written on the block exactly what its for
TwoFive: really, you are being a dick here. Hazard doesn't know as much as you, stop acting like you're brilliant for knowing basic hardware.
thank you wrek
Hazard: You're like 10, right? Ask your mom or dad. Seriously. My mom helped me with my first one when I was like 10.
*you're
/me raises his anti-hate sheilds
Rawrity: I'm just astonished that he doesn't know anything.
TwoFive stop threatening me!
:D
Wat
that was a joke :D
<_< >_>
Is anything playing in the live stream? Nothing is on mine.
05last warnign you two.
/me starts loving and tolerating TwoFive
O.O
My stream just went away
what did i ever do to TwoFive to be banned or kicked?
same
Wrek: I'm actually trying to give him helpful adivce now.
TwoFive: I suppose I should start acting like you're complete moron becuase you don't know as much about obscure british post-hardcore bands?
i'm amazed at the amount of hate right now
Wrel 'two' being hazard and twofive?
Rawrity: You see, those are exactly what you said. Obscure. Computers are commonplace.
i dont hate i love and tolerate
I didnt expect trolling in a place like this
It exsist's
Hazard: Google it, or go on 4chan's /g/. They have good people who'll help you.
i expected trolling but the hate
everywhere you go.
computers and electronics are cool but to be a complete genius in my prespective you need to learn alot of math and science
i agree CupcakeWarrior
trolling happens all the time here... usually in good taste between people... but it gets out of hand somedays
the hate is new for me
CupcakeWarrior: i dont think any of this is quite what trolling is
Please stop the hostility; this isn't what Bronystate's about
but i can see you know alot so im not complaining or calling you not smart
Hazard: Nobody can no everything, man.
Know*
But for tha sake of the comunity i agree with your point CupcakeWarrior
05time out
05relax
05breathe
Ponies!!!
Wrek: Have you been reading the chat? Everybody's chill now, man.
Lol
That was refreshingly calm

this started out as a simple debate over which PCs are better but who cares what kind it is? we just need to use them because thats what their for.

First*
Maybe that will help
Wrek I just hate how the requirements for streaming are so high :\
13lots of gas to belch at any time
IngloriousPony89: true...true but still magic is beastly!
05why do you think i spent 1600 on my rig then?
Shizuka: but whats the lag time between said belch and when it is on the interwebs
drinking mentos Shizuka?
Wrek: 5k
05cause i want to be able to provide 720p quality
ok, gonna get myself some drink... bbl

Shizuka: http://arch.413chan.net/WHY_WUB_WOO_SO_MUCH-(n1293929867319).jpg
emangamer: i thought you loved Scoot-Scootaloo ?
scoot-scootaloo - thank you, but i'll stick to my Anti-Material Rifle
A3-21's Plasma Rifle is the best gun in Fallout 3
and by material, i mean you rhead
The most graphically advanced game i can play on my shitty comp is Starcraft 1
Seems pretty laggy at this point, also, there's no sound
13using normal or mobile quality rather than the "optimized" right?
Hazard: Agreed
well, this framerate needs to be about 20% cooler...
05i dunno
00,03MFW I only have a Van Graff rifle
11,01I"m using optimized.
has the sound died
13try normal, or mobile
Apparently L4D2 is a slideshow now
05are you running l4d2 on all graphical settings on lowest?
Scoot-Scootaloo: theres a scret Plasma Rifle somehwre
13even freespace whined when i used optimized
05are oyu runnign windowed mode with smallest resolution possible?
do u guys have castle crashers for xbox thatd b a fun livestream

13he's not hosting or anything right?
Scoot-Scootaloo: on top of that bridge way up there

Which Halo?
BEHOLD: what passes for snow in my town: http://imgur.com/a/epP0e#0

DaringDude. Yes, for nostalgia
RAWRity: thats NC for you

Halo is always worth buying.
05so do the steps i said
Did you ever play the original halo DaringDude?
yeah
dat EQD post
Then Yesh, Get it for nostalgia's sake
alright sounds good
11,01Lowest graphics setting in windowed mode?

You actually get the option to switch from the old graphics to new graphics at any time DaringDude
05usign smallest possible resolution
Dat 4th wall breach from EqD
well thats cool hows the multyplayer?
Later
It's Halo:Reach style mutiplayer with Halo maps

You know, stir things up a little.
08,01okay, laptop is feeling better now
I wish I had a twin bed
hi
CupcakeWarrior: HOLY SHIT!!!! I WANT THAT BEEEEEEED!!!
/me has a twin bed. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
guess what
Why do I have so MANY FANFICS.
on the fleece throw, Kammerjunk?
08,01so i just had a rather amusing conversation with a friend of mine
Just in general.
Also has twin so bangin'
i can blow a bubble without a bubble with out a bubble wand or anything that can use bubbles with
08,01we were talking about postage, and he said "so long as I intercept my mail before my flatmates, if i'm buying crinkle"
08,01and i said "what's crinkle?"
08,01apparently, he was referring to adult diapers
...Wat
Verb: Form small creases or wrinkles in the surface of something, esp. the skin of the face as the result of a facial expression.
WILL PAY DOUBLE FOR THAT BED SET
Noun:	A wrinkle or crease found on the surface of something: "there was a crinkle of suspicion on her forehead".
08,01which he quickly qualified with "i'm not into that sort of stuff, they're just... really comfy!"
08,01they're padding, see
08,01and also, and this was the killer
send me a message on youtube my account name is cupcakesrock111
08,01"also, they allow me to sit for hours playing minecraft without having to get up to go to the bathroom"
08,01i found that really funny
08,01hey otakon!
/me giggles. So silly.
08,01IngloriousPony89: uk, aye
/me hugs LadyCanary "How are you dear?"
So I googled 'crinkle'. Google asked me for baking ingredients.
08,01i mean, i'm pretty sure he wasn't even joking
when will the aliens come?
Makes you feel nice and safe.
I has food otakon :3 so I am pleased. And yourself?
brieannar: there ARE no aliens in this game
08,01he seems to have taken gaming to a new level
Creepy indeed
no
knowing that there's weapon caches everywhere if such a game should become reality
LadyCanary: pretty good, had rabbit stew for dinner
A new, terrifying level
no no in the real world not the game
...R-rabbit stew?
Who's that? Nittany_Discord?
;__;
08,01thing is, he's this big, fat, spotty, nerdy gamer
otakon: You ate angel?
08,01the only gay i know who has no personal hygiene
CriticKitten: yes I did and he was DELICIOUS!!!!
I would eat alligator soup
You wouldn't eat a TV.
08,01heh
im gona sleep now so goodbye everypony
Fluttershy is not pleased, otakon.
when will the aliens come invade our planet?
08,01well, he already has a fridge by the computer
You wouldn't eat a handbag.
00,105...4...3...starts fireing
She will have her revenge.
Probably not a good idea KwakLad. Dont want to encourage him :P
Fair 'nuff. I'm eating a bowl of Scootaloo soup with dumplings right now, myself.
LadyCanary: it was Angel's evil twin
You wouldn't eat a DVD.
okay then move the toilet to his room
Nomming on pony pets is eating.
LadyCanary: besides I didn't kill em, I just ate em
Well played otakon
If you do it, you WILL face the concequences.

Did you grow an extra arm Scoot?
LadyCanary: Pardon?
The_4th_Wall: no, come back when it's a quarter

Anypony else wanna play LFD2 with me I've never played either game but I have it on steam and I just beat SR3 And I'm bored? D:
Sumica but yeah i did watch it until the end...even the movies
On the PC Dismo?
IngloriousPony89: Yes.
So, word's in as far as The Secret World of Arriety as far as critics are concerned.
I'm back
Apparently it bouls down to: Very good animation, very good character writing, Pacing was shot to hell.
Atill nopony's gonna eat my mane yet
*boils even
?Still-
LIKE A FAWST
Like a pokemon...
That was fun
I kept talking into the mic while it was off...
Anyone wanna have a pokemon battle?
who want's to join?
11,01New spot open.
I would
But I dont have LFD
wants*
Same here
If I ad a key to it
most ponies are playing TF2
would get it
Nittany_Discord: ME
11,01Join then.
How do you get the serv name
lol
XD
no stream?
LFD stream
hmm
Hi everypony! :)
ah, there it is
Hi
Hello there. :)
dat tuba.
Hey Pinkie
So has everypony seen the poll on EQD?
Lol.
How you know you're getting old: You no longer rejoice at the idea of snow, but instead dread the state of the roadways in the coming morning.
Anyone wanna pokemon battle for the rest of my mane
?
Kammerjunk: I have. I voted for Derpy and the Dr.
I voted for the Equestrian history.
I LOVE lore.
I voted for Wrek
Yay for lore. I so understand that.
/me is going to EqD now
Why does it have too be so difficult too play tf2 and watch mlp at the same time...
Get a spray
Lore also opens up new fanfic possibilities, and I'm always looking for more ways to procrastinate.
My own favorite episodes are cutie mark chronicles and hearths warming because of all that wonderful information
Kammerjunk: that would have been my second pic.
*pick
oo they're adding friends...
I like derpy...I heard a rumor that said Hasbro is going to change Derpy's name
11,01I <3 Sonic Rainboom and May The Best Pet Win.
11,01They were.
11,01Well, it was never confirmed.
Damnit, Ditzy
I don't really have a favorite episode
I picked Lore as well
Does anyone wanna pkmn battle?
A pikmin battle?
POKEMON
XD
But c'mon...IT'S DERPY AND THE DOCTOR. WITH SHENANIGANS. We'd finally know how Derpy got into that snow globe!
PinkieCupcake: just rumors. nothing's come of it, nothing is likely to come of it.
Ohhhhhhhhh
it's just an unpleasant shit storm that will hopefully be left buried in the past from not on.
The reason I didn't pick the Doctor & Derpy one was partly because I have to agree with dari on the 11th Doctor and partly because I will spend an entire day just reading about the lore of whatever.
11,01There was a thing where some people got angry because the portrayed Derpy as a retard. They stated that Derpy insulted disabled people.
0,5My favorite episode used the be Lesson Zero... but then I took a "Last Roundup" to the knee.
lol
Celestia!!!! :D
My favourite episode is still Lesson Zero.
/me shoots Celestia in the knee with an arrow
HI GIRLZ
00,03>_>
13lolcrashed ><
CUT OFF THE DAMN JOKE
Definetly the last roundup
Lesson Zero was the funniest episode
Kammerjunk: Well, Dr. Whooves is apparently meant to look like the TENTH doctor, so...
/me flies over to Celestia and nestles in his...her? mane.
0,5It was very funny
I'm not the greatst fan of lesson zero, i prefer Twi her normal adorable way
Oh, good. But still.
0,5*girly wave*
0,5Im a woman
0,5_/`
/me doesn't get why people are so in love with Lesson Zero
Swanlestia
No you're not, you're a piece of bacon with a bacon mane.
When you claim that something insults disabled people , not being one of them , you are insulting disabled people !
Because insanity RAWRity.
Mother of god, Celestia.
11,01Lesson Zero is now the most elected episode here.
Yeah
Trollestia or Discord?
11,01Discord.
Nittany_Discord: even more than Sonic Rainboom?
Discord
Guys
RAWRity: Well, I'd reckon you don't get why I love Trixie either, so that's fine.
13blah now tf2 won't relaunch .-.
Anyone wanna pokemon battle?
I wasn't around when Derpy came to be, so that takes some of it away from me.
13dumm tf2
11,01Sonic Rainboom needs to be picked more.
Shizuka
Add me on Steam
my nick is Magical Pyro
13warum?
ohai everypony, and same problem Shizuka
Add meeee
Nittany_Discord: S1 EP16 used to be my favourite one, until I saw EP23.
>=3
11,01Party of One?
Well I'm new here so I'm kinda getting use to the brony community :)
My favorite is the Daring Do episode
Kammerjunk: I can understand Trixie's fanbase to an extent but..I just don't see WHY people love it so much. I can understand (even if I disagree with) the fangasm over Luna Eclipsed, because y'know, it's Luna. But Lesson Zero doesn't really have anything that explains the love for it.
11,01Read it and Weep?
00,03Cutie Mark Chronicles all day, errday!
text wall
No, the Cutie Mark Chronicles.
Ye
ZOh jeez
Oh! Welcome to the herd PinkieCupcake ^_^ enjoy yourself <3
Scoot-Scootaloo is here
11,01I know the episodes by name but not by number.
Oh, wait.
You're right.
Better break his/her own scooter
13ooo open slot
13wait for emeeee
I had it backwrds.
/me breaks Scoot-Scootaloo's scooter
Episode 23, then.
brb
Yaaaaay Shizuka's gonna play <3
00,03D:<
RAWRity: its a twi centric s2 episode, we only have one
:)
Phase4: There's that. Twilight is also my favourite pony of all. And it was fun to watch.
00,03Your lucky I'm trying to find the super special Plasma Rifle...
/me destroys that too
00,03D:<<<
o_o
I gotta eat and take a shower everypony. See y'all later.
Holy hay, I just realised that there's like 8 episodes left of series 2.
Bye IngloriousPony89!
Have fun, IngloriousPony89.
later IngloriousPony89
i think Lesson Zero is the one that will destroy the "for kids" stigma if you show it to new people , even more than party of one
lolwut? octy in the drawfriend
^ wat
My dad just ruined plans for dinner.. :|
TrixieMuffin indeed :)
Kammerjunk: http://derpy.me/GHcZD
13sorry canary, maybe next time <3
I generally don't visit drawfriends. There are only so many hours in the day.
Oh, I thought you meant Octy as in an octopus.
/me glares at Dismo for taking Shizuka's spot :|
13X3
Still, that's a pretty neat pony.
Octy as in Octavia?
Toy_Pon3 what's your steam username
MUST KNOW
Octotavia is best ponysquid
Shizuka what's yours too?
Aaaaand mIRC decided to be a jerk to me again.
13i do not like rochelle much anyways... zoey ist much better
I can see that, TrixieMuffin. It's probably the best episode to show to skepticks.
TOY_PON3?
Luna-darned keyboard layouts.
TrixieMuffin So true she is the best pony squid
I hope Scoot-Scootaloo doesn't kill me
I hate this layout thing.
Testing, testing - æøåøæå
00,03ONce I find a plasma rifle...
Good.
/me holds one
Hehe
Lol
/me hands it to Scoot-Scootlaoo and gets a 10 second head start
00,03YOU!!
silly pinkie chickens cant kill you
00,03I'll get you!
So, remember how people were saying that Season 2 was lacking on songs? I feel like the latest ep was made JUST to get those people to shut up.
10 second slatah
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
00,03hey Phase4!
Crap
now there's 2 ponies looking for me
RAWRity: And I feel like it worked.
00,03I got you now, Pinkie!
Oh, we need more songs? HERE'S 4 IN ONE EPISODE.
00,10hey Nittany_Discord, how long were you planing on this any ways?
Four songs in a single episode.
08,01but only one was good
Oh no
i'm cornered
So the current Song count for S2 = 11
08,01and to be fair, it was the best song of the season
I don't even know what's going on between PinkiePieCopy and Scoot-Scootaloo, and I don't think I want to.
08,01possibly the best song of the entire program
0,5Yes?
So dearly, my Frank, I don't damn a give.
08,01nay, the entire franchise
08,01*neigh
0,5YES?
I broke his/her scooter
00,03Kammerjunk: He/she broke my scooter!
Smiiiiile~
Aha.
Poor scooter
Entire program? Eh, gotta say Art of the Dress still holds that for me, but it WAS the best song for S2, most def.
Hey no dissin the hymn of Smooze
/me 11,01gives Scoot-Scootaloo a new scooter.
That's good enoguh reason to shoot her with a plasma rifle, I suppose.
00,03:D
/me breaks it
enough*
Tehheee
08,01i didn't really like Art of the Dress
00,03:[
...I-I liked it.
08,01it was too much like an existing Sondheim song
and yes, I do still say most def.
/me 11,01covers PinkiePieCopy and explodes.
08,01an awesome Sondheim song, nonetheless
He saved me
=D
00,03:D
/me eat's Nittany's raw flesh
Because I like pretty dresses and stuff >3>
nothing can stop the SMOOOOOOZEE
/me 11,01dresses LadyCanary up.
I like the Find a pet song and the giggle at the ghosties song
So who was talking about that picture in the drawfriend?
JK
Nittany_Discord: But Im not a doll D:
It's sad really, of the 4 full-length songs we had, Rarity's is next to last. Step it up!
11,01You're still pretty.
.//////////.
So no pony else has L4D2?
00,03daww
/me hides under a table
I think the Cutie Mark Crusaders song is the best song ever.
That was sweet lol
So now what? Kill me? Hold me? Eat me? Eat my mane?
100 people!
Because it's the only one I'm even close to having the skill to sing.
oh, I'm sorry, of the 5.
forgot about the CMC's song.
i didnt like 'smile smile smile' that much first time, but its growing on me
TOY_PON3: Sure I do, but I don't play it a lot.
00,03How about all of the above, PinkiePieCopy?

You're all dead, Nittany.
RAWRity: LOL
Kill them all, Johnny.

Kill them all
/me slices Toy
Nittany_Discord: Almost on my way it's derping on me
Ow!
TOY_PON3: Sliced
RAWRity: Dat pun.
here's a thought: Don't you think Edward Scissorhands could have had a promising future as a preofessional arm wrestler?
More or less arm amputator.
mfw its snowing
Oh hi, dari.
/me mauls TOY_PON3 with claws
He's just misunderstood Kammerjunk D: D:
[SWAG]thehated5689: you in NC?
Ahhh!!!
rawrity: a bit more south, VA
/me is back on
I will..... TASTE YOu....
...VA is NORTH of NC...
._.
/me eats TOY_PON3 's flesh
Lady Canary: if he was real he would definetly be diagnosed as flippin those ass burgers
saw NY
not NC
maybe not crazy though
This chat is weird
LadyCanary: It's just, what was going on in Burton's head? Did he just look at Depp and say "You know what that guy needs? Scissors on his hands. That'll make the film work!"
I thought it was based off of a book
To be fair, I dont even know why he used scissors
someone needs to hit me, i derped too badly
Kammerjunk: better than "You know what this guy needs? an unexplained scottish accent."
/me eats the rest of TOY_PON3
Is it, otakon? I never knew that.
/me hits [SWAG]thehated5689.
I could have sworn at least
thank you
LeDerp, Le Failed
that was a nice game of TF2, despite the low # of people :)
RAWRity: Fair point.
CountDoofus: I couldn't connect at ALL
so that's why I wasn't in it
bbl
hmm, maybe next time then
Who's on the screen right now?
see ya latet thehated!

Run! Go! Get to da choppah!

You know, PinkiePieCopy, Scoot-Scootaloo is the one who did it.

Derpy_Hooves: OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!

So you have one medkit and all of you have low health.

^
Then you startle the Witch.
CCCP but they are so derpy with bad depth perception and end up hitting you, by accident of course
god I hate jockeys

Jockeys are just little kids who want rides.

KwakLad: only in SSBB
Dem...propane tanks?
Yes
00,10understantment of the day.

When will the ponies be available to play in Super Smash Bros?
^
You don't truly know a nation's culture until you've smelled it's sewer.
I want to screw shit over with derpy

But i want to kill kirby

It seriously sounded like he was saying socks and not sucks.
too bad it's 8:30 at night now
LadyCanary: socks?
Louis must be a Luna fan.
CCCP: Oh my god...
I never played or watched this game
I WUB IT
This might be.. interesting if its multiplayer
flutter_spin: it's fun
SayWhat: MUHAHAHA
flutter_spin: it is
so pasific = est right?
I still hate Kirby
http://memegenerator.net/instance/11016291
So what, 2 players and 2 comp?
The most fun I have in this game is exploiting the hilariously bad engine.
flutter_spin: 4 players.
Or 8.
Depends on the gamemode.
I meant right now
[SWAG]thehated5689: Nicely done
4 players right now.
/me could still use a hug
Are there 2 that are zombies?
i dont know how to hug
Dat link :o
13dat google image search link
You're at a hospital because the chopper that'll rescue you is at the very top of the hospital.
05i think he hates hospitals
SayWhat: your such a n00w
n00b
I hate hospitals. And doctors, and lawyers, and cops.
SayWhat: use derpy.me
note to self: Hospitals are shit for fighting zombies
I just find it odd that other players characters say default messages
CCCP: no...just do it right and not link the wrong thing
dat link wall
I guess it is a nice feature.
tankrty tanker tank

Good!
Not meh
yay
meh a tad laggy and made my dog throw up by hiting her with a snowball, you?
So there are weapons randomly laid out in the hospital? heh
emangamer: nah, it's fine.
I saw it on EQD
emangamer: But funny nevertheless.
Shizuka: you seen the newest drawfriend?
People seem to think PG-13 can't have suggestive material.
who's streaming btw?
13no why
CountDoofus: nittany
This ain't innapropriate
Drawfriends would be the end of me if I followed them.
I handled Fluttershy snapping a bear's neck
Shizuka: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fKzZXyMdkpQ/T0GDvO78o2I/AAAAAAAAfuo/eLWPZnjEazc/s1600/134963+-+artist+Don-KomandoRR+heavy_weapons_guy+pinkie_pie+sasha+Team_Fortress_2+umbrella.jpg
implied boink boink is fine
I think i got this
13that first one?
13but i do not play heavy .-.
oh Shizuka, you were in that TF2 game earlier right?
Which do you guys prefer, L4D or Killing FLoor?
emangamer: Credit to team.
Killing floor
13und besides i thought fluttershy x heavy was the canon pair
L4D
.___.
ded
Shizuka: ...wat?
aww
Jaketehsnake: Never played Killing Floor, so I can't make a qualified decision.
so whos streamin?
>canon
I have no idea what you just said Shizuka
SURE.
I don't know. I mean we ARE seeing people killing hundreds of zombies
haven't played Killing Floor, so I'd say L4D
meh: nittany i think
13in gmod videos
cool
13heavy is always paired with fluttershy, not pinkie
hey everypony ^_^
He is, isn't he.
heya Scoota
oh look, L4D
heyo ScootaChicken
Herro
That's probably because of the irony.
hi Nittany_Discord give them a sound butt woopin for me
KammerJunk, I got it for 2.99 a few daus ago. Standard play is 6 people but some modded games allow 20. Moar zombies too!
Shizuka: who is pinkie paired with? i forget..
Shizuka: ...wat?
But you have to admit, Pinkie and the Heavy would probably get along just fine.
13pinkie pairs with...
13soldier i think
or Medic
rarity is with spy
Hi ScootaChicken!!
Shizuka: I still dont knwo whats going on...you forget that I still cant get Steam to work
13rarity with spy
for some reason, Rarity is spy. I dun geddit
Jaketehsnake: I don't even play L4D a lot.

I wouldve said medic with pinkie
dat flyingcharger
RAWRity: It's the sophistication associated with being French, I suppose.
The Spy has always been a gentleman.
She can speak french I guess that's why
http://derpy.me/dJRpT Problem?
CountDoofus: 0.o
CountDoofus: umm...is that...I dont...what
I love the gentelmen side of the spy
CountDoofus: they should have stayed out of her shed.
Rarity cares about how she looks, even if its like another person :P
:)
soooooo... how bout dat smile?
im making it a goal to click all the links
SayWhat: My mind should probably be blown at that, but it's Pinkie Pie, so it's best to not think about it.
How bout dem lakerz?
knicks
dat music
Oh hi there, random Jockey.
there NEEDS to be an Apple Jack emoticon
hey Shizuka, were you in that TF2 game earlier?
That music suggests a Witch.
And spike
I just watched Mystery Science theatre 3000 last night.
13yup
Hmmm...eternal looks interseting
13the pyro doing badly? yup
You DONT say Kammerjunk.
And then you completely ignore your previous failures with witches.
if you want, I have a Strange Backburner I don't use
Do you guys get scared while playing?
seriously, it pisses me off that I can't get steam to work...
Fun Fact: acording do Wiki, Pinkie Pie is the only pony to have her uvula shown on screen in every episode she's in.
LadyCanary: I was just commenting on what flutter_spin said.
Jaketehsnake: <3 MST3K
Dat EXTRA PISTOL.
oddly enough this game doesnt scare me and yet resident evil makes me jump all the time
Ah. My bad Kammerjunk ^^" been up since 7am so Im a bit out of it
i have uhhh.somthing to admit amnesia doesn't scare me
no one ever knows how to get my steam to work....both Shizuka and Luna have given up on me
Fair 'nuff.
voices?!
Sleep is for the weak, you know.
CCCP it was very... different. In an amazing way. My friends usually do that kind of commentary with our movies but we didnt have to this time!
So a witch is something everyone should be afraid of?
dat lederp voice
13dunno what's wrong with your steam .-.
she just needs a hug
Shizuka: haven't we been though this? I cant connect to the server
L4D creeped my out the first few times I played it, then it's just a normal shooter
I require sustainance, i shall be back
me* out
To really get into the story.
I GO
YOU GO
IT GOES
Shizuka: I checked my cache earlier and it was fine. I don't know why I couldn't connect
dat Jockey
you go!
Kammerjunk: i like the game actually but it only makes me feel slightly uneasy
lemme think i know i saw something that scared me into total wuss status recently but i forgot what
My buddie's science fair was heart rates during videogames the only game that had a signifigant difference was amnesia. 25BPM
brb guys
I want to hear more girly screams!

otakon: but...but...but
ENOPE

and it was scarey in the campaign but not nearly too scarey
alright guys I'll be back gonna play some Mass Effect 3 MP!
Fun fact: If you wake up at around 1 AM to 3 AM seemingly without reason, there's a 89.76% chance that Alma is watching you.
:p bye otakon

Kammerjunk: what does it mean if you dont sleep till after that?

ScootaChicken: so Military police and Members of parliament both MP's are my little ponies?
KwakLad: They are now.
KwakLad... mother of god

KammerJunk I applaud that!
Ictiv is better at it.
I'm not artistic in any way.

I bet you there's a mod for that.
kirzstryfe: I added you, and will send an invite when you get online ;)
Louis is such a whiner.
^
nvm, you are
emangamer: :'( but louis is my fav character...
Midnight_Tempest: how is zoey not your favorite?
:| :O :D :)
TOY_PON3, you're playing a whiner.
lmao
LOL
HA HA HA
What the hay.
And this is why I love this game.
emangamer: too tomboyish
The best thing to do here is to just exploit the engine,
Woot! People are talking!
Nope.
then they all died...
And then my stream froze.
and then ponies
I'm just waiting for someone to scream or yell leeroy and run around like a madman
so... who's cheering for the zombies? I AM!
Ditto.
YAY!
/me highfives all around for the zombie team
Go zombies!
There's a-me!

You killed Louis.
Good job, man.

ScootaChicken: SHUT UP, you're not my real mom!!

"I'm sorry. I saw blodd on you and thought you were a zombie"
emangamer: ORLY

And then my stream froze.

00,10Time to change it up a bit.
11,01Changing stream?
ScootaChicken: YARLLY.jpg
00,10eeyup
1,3brony + target audience = http://derpy.me/dawww
reminds me of Family Guy "I'm not a douche, I'm just new"
kirzstryfe: I love you
I'm so tired. I'm probably going to go play some TF2 to get my mind off sleep
We can conclude ScootaChicken is not weak
indeed kirzstryfe a good find
1,3I was there
1,3took that at megacon today
still
I am jelly.
Really jelly.
Dat hair
I'm so jelly, you could smear me on toast.
But please don't.
1,3little girl had a singing Twi doll, I was jelly >.<
NOW I jelly
I double jelly.
/me preps some toast :3
11,01http://www.livestream.com/nittanydiscord <- If anyone wants to continue to watch our game.
depends on what is going on here.
What's going on in this ro-
Aww hay.
00,10it's also good cause it gets nitt more views on his LS.
rawr
hahaha
Yes.
Where did I put that little piece of rainbow?
...why am I stuck thinking of g1 ponies?
1,3FMA:B? I approve :)
00,10Shoo be doo?
SHOO SHOO BE DOO
Ah brotherhood!
what is this?
Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood
FMA <3
I love Winry
Been so long since I've seen FMA in general.
Heard brotherhood wwas good though.
1,3follows the manga more closely
... FMA? :D
hey kirzstryfe
The TV show overtook the Manga, that's why it had to be different, or so I've heard.
The uh, anime I mean
And then they did it with the Manga's ending for Brotherhood
1,3hey :)
Al!
full metal alchemist
Oh my gosh! How I've missed him.
whats that kids name again?
Al
i used to watch it late at night. great anime
Alfons.. or Alfonz... however you spell it.
OH YEA
Alfonse
DAFONZE Xd
My sound is broken, so I can't hear what's going on. :C
AlFonzy: I ain't got no bodyrino, EEEHHHHHHH
EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
wtf
WhaaA?
...He's hungreh?
Lickitung?
1,3there are some things anime can convey better than manga, and vice versa
ouch
Gluttony is always hungry
LadyCanary: well he IS GLuttony
also, I think we saw this ep already.
Ahhh.
Been a whole since Ive seen all this
Dat Lickitung
10,02Hmm...I really should go and get food...
EWW
10,02mfw I haven't eaten anything this entire time O__O
I believe we left off with Gluttony opening up his stomach to try and kill Mustang.
/me tackle-glomps SuperBrony64
00,10yes less eating at 3am SB
WHAT
Go get foooood
00,10Jack in the box every night is bad for you.
This is so weird
What is going on?!
10,02I love Jack in the Box and it'
lol dog
10,02it's good for me ^_^
EWW POOR PUPPY
skype conversations keeping me up
SB64, you should definately go get more tacos :$
It like the arm
1,3bad guy was tracking her blood, so they cut off her arm and tied it to the dog
don't worry bout it
and OMG WUT IS THAT A DOG WITH AN ARM ON IT
WAT
This show is just full of wtfmode
...Oooh.
D;
Ouch.
1,3FMA:B, went a bit darker than the first run of the series
and why did that guy earlier look like that guy from Naruto
SayWhat: basically: Eyepatch dude and Fat guy are monsters trying to kill all humans, blond guy and amrmor dude, as wells as the asian guy, are trying to stop them. Scarfaced guy is antihero who hates the blond guy and armor dude
I get it now
original FMA had such a strange end...
Thansk
00,10he took a chibi to the face.
1,3lol
But the armor dude ain't a dude
asian girl and panda are friends with scarface and want to protect them.
:D What a cutie.
00,10yeah he's just a suit of armor with a soul in it.
Dat pentagram
damn
not sure how seriously this anime wants me take it
dat Alcahestry
I'm not sure tiher?
1,3this early in it, not very
...Why have I not watched this series.
i have that ability in wicca in the middle of june O-O
either*
WHYYY.
1,3gets serious later on
He asian
ScootaChicken: that's kind of Brotherhood's biggest fault. it tends to stick comic relief in the middle of tense drama a lot.
00,10You are not supposed to take it serious, it's just a TV show.
1,3saw Li's VA this weekend :)
But i take MLP seriously
00,10that's not a TV show, it's a way of life
True that.
;)
Ahhh, I seeeeee
PIIIIEEEE
N'yess
00,10there are no life lessons in this
As I am aware ^_^ thank you
Well, the life lesson would be to take super powers out of pentagrams? Does it tell us to warship satan?
it just seems a bit weird that in the middle of this dark, futuristic, dystopian anime you have girls running around in Kimonos
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lznp3n7kSZ1rnpo0wo1_400.gif
and... y'know, scenes like this
Everytime I hear Japanese I only think of Total War: Shogun 2, "A SHAMEFUL DISPLAY!"
nah, see the other alchemists gain their power from HEXagrams!
LOL
Dat panda
so it's really supporting Jews
dat Wrath
dat ded chat
Chat is ded, long live the chat!
busy watching!
sry, too tired to chat.
Chat: Discuss
just thought of something. Scar is like if Batman was a militant nationalist.
dat soothing voice -v-
wtf at that voice
Dat phone
FMA <3
wow
but batman doesnt kill
Thefrst time i ever saw an A&W Rootbeer can, i thought the picture was a sheep in a trashcan
/me eats dinner
dat Train Station,...
1,3Shizuka is Winry, does all the work and everyone misses her when she's gone
:3
Stouffers cheddar potato bake
1,3VioletVanilla is Ed, kicks ass all over the place
1,3start the shipping :3
...You're right kirz.
OH MY GOD!!!!
Is that robot thing a chick?
fullmetal alchemist!
i absolutley LOVE this show!
AWWWW
SayWhat: he's called 'Al' I somehow doubt it
Al is not a chick
Omfg!! When did this start!?!
1,3suit of armor is Ed's brother's soul stuck in a suit of armor
What's a fullmetal alchemust?
But...
hes a 14 year old boy
kirzstryfe: so what you're saying is, Shizuka would be completely useless in the fight against an ancient, deranged eldritch abomination?
he's got a soft side under all that andry :3
Whaaaa?!
13mmmmmmm yeah
angry*
13pretty much
SayWhat, have you not seen this show?
No?
iv seen EVERY episode
:o
IS that not a good thing?
Depends on your likes :P I think its an Amazing anime
FMA is an amazing show it would be a pain to miss something so great
:D
>.<
SayWhat: the feminine voice is the Japanese VA trying to do a young boy's voice.
oh damn
oh look FMA Awesome also Hi~ everyone
UUGH jees this went from nice to JEEBUS in ten seconds flat :D
Illidan: YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!
This is on TBS?
oh hau hai thar fma brotherhood
i still cant believe that ninja girl just fucking cut her arm off taped it to a dog with explosives on it! INSANE!
*waits for ME3 demo to dl*
cybernetic limbs IRL would be so awesome
what is an "automail"?
GEt the replacement arm from Al
hooray! more work for winry!
automail is mechanical limbs
my friend would be able to walk and use both his arms properly
Hazard: I don't remember any explosives.
in this anime
i do RAWRity
Shes the one that got attacked by Bradley right?
HE'S GON' BLOW!
the one in the bed
she i think taped her arm to a dog
it's fat'n ugly
00,10Wait so who am I kirzstryfe?
I just remember her strapping it to a god to distract Wrath
fuck gluttony...
*dog
Who?
It's an egg sac! Smash it1
1,3you can be Al, you whine all the time and get eaten
1,3;)
Who is but the form following the function of what.
Sumica: you're Havoc
And what you are is a mod on BronyState.
00,10lawl
:o
I don't get it
i wish this wasnt japanese
Godzilla: The end
Hazard, the english voices are weird
^
the japanese voices are wierd
I don't mind so bad that its Japanese, as long as its the Brotherhood version
Rage!
Smash the egg sac!
:D
SMASH IT
Kill it with fire, Mustang!!!
burn the shit out of him!!!!!!
my god that's Freudian
dayum that thing is CHAWNKAY
...
Has anypony seen Soul Eater?
me
I have, but only a little bit
SayWhat: I have
same
nope
i cant get back into Bleach
00,10Well Mustang did roast his love.
I only saw one ep, it was intersting
1,3only a bit here, read more of the manga
or Inuyasha
why not Hazard ?
i CANT
still cant tell if krona is a boy or a girl
FOOOOOOOOOD AFK
What is the Friday Stream, what are they gonna stream then?
Or both?
but why?
i stopped on 1 episode and BAM i didnt know whats happeneing!
Or neither?
1,3Bleach is almost over, not sure how I feel on that
bleach has like 300 episodes
I've seen Bleach movies, and an episode here and there. Never got into it either
Soul Eater can bs summed up pretty easily: Visually interesting, boring as hell from a character and plot standpoint.
Krona is just a sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania.
lol ikr if you dont watch them continuosly its confusing
alright skype and BronyState, go away, I need some sleep tonight
00,10almost over? last I heard it was't even halfway, and that was just last year.
kirzstryfe: if by "almost over" you mean "Kubo's gonna milk this last arc for at least 3 years"
cya ScootaChicken
1,3probably lol
Sumica: I think you're thinking of One Piece
1,3creator just started on the last arc Sumica
00,10that too
Night ScootaChicken
god damn so many animes
because One Piece just reached the halfway point about a year ago.
Whooaa
dat mouth
:o
XD
dinner's in the nuke
1,3yeah, One Piece is a massive story
Microwave is worse than a nuke
falsemalarm food has 5 min.
lol
Naruto also seems to be nearing its end.
One Piece? Dang, havent heard about that for a While now O.o
would it be a good idea to microwave this?
I don't know. I feel like I am catching up with stuff. I am just now halfway through Bioshock
RAWRity: FINALLY.
Microwave makes your Chicken Nuggets soggy, nukes don't
XD
:D
1,3Naruto has picked up a bit the last few issues, I like how it's shifted to more action
ha
you BAKE zem
hehe
i bake my naruto aswell
It'll be interesting what comes to take the place of Naruto and Bleach. I'm guessing Toriko and Bakuman are the manga tha'll take those spots.
Don't even get me started on microwaving Tostinos
thats a horrible idea SayWhat
'Tis
hell, Toriko basically HAS replaced Bleach in terms of weekly rankings.
damn
1,3Toriko?
That's a manly chick
...Wait a minute....ENVY?
and Naruto's been hovering in the 6-10 range in the rankings lately.
lol hard to beleive that bitch is a giant 400 ton monster
I like anime but after Toonami left, I was left out of the loop
LadyCanary: eeyup, that's envy.
SPOILER
Wow! I actually remembered.
:D
S/he's flatter than kansas
Envy is a bitch
kirzstryfe: it's a manga about Eating really good food to become true men.
nobody's entirely sure what gender envy is.
both RAWRity
/me sigh...
both
00,10both, neather.
and really, considering its power, probably depends on its mood.
actually neither because shes an humunculous
dat neather
dat an
We shall refer to Envy as... IT!
dat sweat
XD
wouldn't that village be toast either way?
1,3they never really touch on the gender in brotherhood
Inside the belly :O
08,01so i'm thinking of doing a couple of videos
thats a bloody stake
Fun Fact: Toriko is the only manga at the moment to have had a crossover with Dragonball Z
envy would be crona's bff
08,01called Drunk Physics
tell me again what a hum..ugh, I can't even spell it
Snake > Wrath
08,01in which i drink a load of alcohol, then (attempt to) explain some physics
1,3homunculus
1,3artificial human
its an artificial human
made through alchemy
flutter_spin: artificial human created using a philosopher's stone.
test tube creations?
oh
Androids are artificial humans
08,01who'd watch this?
not clones flutter_spin
So Terminator is artificial?
idk
Are you telling me Terminator is fake?
Phew
XD
1,3sacrifice a few hundred human souls to put them into the result of a failed human transmutation
Has anypony heard of the song Emerals Sword?
thats pointless acually
With a big tongue
a failed transmute?
It's led to gold all over again!
flutter_spin: a failed attempt to recreate human life.
Are there any successful?
IH SHMIT
OH*
panda mask
no...nopony?
fus ro dah
flutter_spin: as of now? Nope.
Nah
he mad
Oh me emangamer
1,3like with Ed and Al, they try to bring their mom back to life, end up losing Al's body, Ed's arm and leg, and they get a half-alive mass of flesh
by rhapsody?
ok good.... I'm not the only one
Ziltoidian: yea
yol tor shul
Rhapsody of Fire
00,10gonna give himself heart burn doing that.
if it is by rhapsody then yes
I havdnt listen to rhapsody in a while
kirzstryfe: well, sort of. Al lost his EVERYTHING, and ed sacrificed his arm to bring his soul back into the armor.
I wish i had superpowers :( If you could have any superpwer, what wouldit be? Mine would be Time control
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Emerals Sword?
ugh, the dl is lagging the stream. Maybe I should pause it
mines would be teleporting
meh
SayWhat: maybe the ability to NOT DIE
meh
whats this?
/me was watching something else
thats nice but if you can still feel pain you might want to die
I think mine would be teleportation, or flight. MAYBE invisibility, but only if I could make more than just my body explode.
Exactly
THis fullmetal alchemist brotherhood
What if you got stuck in a really deep pit, what would you do?
Hazard: but is it? Then you get to watch your friends and loved ones die while you live on.
Sit around and do nothing?
WHatt hatateafhsdfasf
nor really sure i have this two Emerald Sword and holy thunderforce
i just started watching
I would want to die, otherwise i'd get bored when the world ends and there are no more ponies to entertain my ADD ridden soul
00,10Sounded like he yelled FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFuck
why is there mr mouth chest
o/ For the king, for the land, for the mountains. For the green vallies where draons fly, for the glory the power to wing the black lord, I will search the Emerald Sword o/
RAWRity: oh well i could wait till the future to time travel and get zem back!
AHA
win*
I have ADOS - Attention defi-ooo shiny
colonel is useless in rain
/me creeps into chat
:3
oh shit its TOY_PON3
ugh. No matter what, my brain still reads col-o-nel, instead of ker-nel
this show is strange and confusing, i;ma go watch that other thing
/me Brohoofs TOY_PON3
I never been to japan :(
DAT panda
08,01why does al have a tiny panda?
/me brohoofs Hazard back
Pandy :3 :3 :3
So cuuute~
because tiny pandas rock
YOU DONT SAY
1,3why wouldn't he have a tiny panda?
^
Panda Express is probably my favorite place in the world
08,01urgh, i do not like what i've seen of Brotherhood so far
its a part of a side story
00,10He picked it up after the fought with the little girl it belongs to.
1,3it's hard to get into it unless you see it from the start
If i had a choice to go anywhere right now, it'd be panda express
morning.. wow FMA brotherhood...
and kirzstryfe
only reason he wouldnt have a tiny panda would be if he had a tiny pony
mmmmnumnum
1,3:)
and valoreins
I wish the hub would just be My Little Pony for 24 hours
08,01the animation is better than the original anime, but the music isn't, and the way it's generally carried off carried so much less emotional impact
^
Roy Mustang is best pony
I don't the Hub though :(
that would be too much mlp
a'ww man!
00,10I want chilli dogs
indeed
Because TINY MINISKIRTS
SayWhat: i dont the hub either
I'm missing FMAB!
argh
WHOA!
Damn Gluttony
oh well
ohai otakon
LadyCanary: YOU'RE A GENIUS
1,3<3 LadyCanary
Havoc and huges are best ponies
it's still lagging like a bitch
08,01and before anyone says anything, i don't really care that this one follows the manga more closely
hiya kirzstryfe
^-^
hi otakon :P
oh hai ency
Phase4: My parents are too cheap to pay mroe than 5 bucks a year
envy*
hi otakon
/me noms on otakon's leg
dat envy
08,01otakon: not really, no
crazy
Yeah, brotherhood's biggest issue is maintaining tone. They tend to wreck dramatic scenes with comic relief, or the music just...doesn't work.
Envy is best brony
envy was always my favorite
Oh the horrid cosplays Ive seen of Envy.
you said that...
i like Teacher
LadyCanary: Tell me about it :D
SayWhat: i;m in australia, its $40 a month for the channel with pony :( brohoof? /)
LadyCanary: what about the shitty Lust cosplays?
shes badass
okay, I'm off to play more ME3 MP, brb
1,3I saw some horrible Pinkie cosplays this weekend >.<
D:
(\
lol, I should play with you otakon.
How were they so bad, kirzstryfe? No effort?
kirzstryfe: why?
ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
LadyCanary: odds are, they were guys.
1,3hard to explain, just scary
dat Square Enix
kirzstryfe: Don't get too detailed I don't wanna image it in my mind
I was actually back from watching Family Guy
Avatar The Last Airbender was a big let down
nom nom nom
RAWRity: It actually doesnt look half bad
TOY_PON3: then that would be like the "transformers" case again...
And flutter_spin: IT NEVER HAPPENED.
08,01Hazard: so very much
/me cringes
At least Legend of Korrah will be awesome
how come you need 5 tough muscular earth benders to move 1 tiny bould!
er
