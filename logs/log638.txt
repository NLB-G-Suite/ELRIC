i cant believe how much i hate mainstream and casual gamers
:D
6_9
/me doesn't hate casuals
:P
:O
their techdemos given out as games is kinda --eh
In fact many mainstream games are good
05only vikings
aww
mainstream and casual helps us pay for gamedev and industry development
Yar ^_^
CoD isn't bad either, it's just..onetrack

Fun fact about my friend: He once went to talk to some people in a house that were threatening to call the police (party in a field), he ended up playing a song for them on a guitar, talking to them about music, after which point they told me "We were never really going to call the polcie anyway"
but SP campaign might count as different-
lol
i cant believe how much gaming has gone downhill
no goal, just--fight
Lawl
and that can be a ton of fun
Just because it's mainstream doesn't mean it's bad.
It just means that it's very popular in today's society.
Although some things don't really deserve popularity........

If it's gaming, I'm getting a desktop. Anything else, laptop.
I drag my laptop everywhere with me
keep several copies of my drive hidden around the state lol
R.I.P. Netbook, we had such good times together. :(

For some reason when I take naps, I feel like I wasted time and I'm sad for the rest of the day.
I wish I didn't have to sleep at all actually
think of the extra time!
I can't wake up after 9 AM feeling like my entire day is ruined. :D

STFU :P
I never played Zelda games, sadly
It was like 20 years ago (or it feels that way)
I haven't owned an NES or SNES since I was *9*
Look, I have spare time!!!
me too
Didnt play much else :D
LCD?
Spyro was great.
Weh ninsomniac had it...
I have never owned a NES or SNES (or at least played with them) , N64 was my first
Until Insomiac Games sold their license.
*When insomniac
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEChu3hnJhU&feature=BFa&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA
I cant look at todays Spyro games
Confusingly, I got PSX, then N64, then SNES, then NES, then I sold the Famicon and SNES, then later sold the PSX and N64 to get the PS2, then got a Gamecube, then it broke.
It needs about 20% cooler
My first console was a PS1. I never had anything before that :\
Just hear the whole thing...It's really good.
i believe mine was a SNES
