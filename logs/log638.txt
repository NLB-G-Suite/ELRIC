i cant believe how much i hate mainstream and casual gamers
Wrek spracken de english XD
:D
6_9
/me doesn't hate casuals
Bronysith why do you hate them? :(
:P
It makes you sound like a hipster
Bronysith: not all mainstream is bad, tf2 is pretty mainstreamy and you love it.
:O
I had more trouble with the indie community-
FUS RO DAH?
their techdemos given out as games is kinda --eh
In fact many mainstream games are good
05no fus ro dah here
Freefall29: not as mainstreamy as call of duty or skyrim or shit like that
05only vikings
aww
mainstream and casual helps us pay for gamedev and industry development
Yar ^_^
05with his trusted axes bumtaze and candybar
CoD isn't bad either, it's just..onetrack
but in der toungue is ponikiin equinborn LOVE AND TOLERATE
<333333333
Best axes.
Bronysith don't generalize all mainstream games
8)
my only problem with mainstream is when they only care about quantity rather then quality. so they copy and paste shit that's been done before *cough* black ops 2 and put no effort to do something new
playing CoD is like playing hl1 mp
Fun fact about my friend: He once went to talk to some people in a house that were threatening to call the police (party in a field), he ended up playing a song for them on a guitar, talking to them about music, after which point they told me "We were never really going to call the polcie anyway"
6Once my friend had given me her phone during class so I could look at the songs she had on it..I fail with touchscreen stuff though and instead of scrolling I put on a song by accident..I didn't know how to turn down the volume and to pause it I'd kinda have to risk it getting heard and getting in trouble..Meanwhile people had started "coughing" so as to save
that's true Freefall29, while I thought MW1 was fun, I have no idea if there's any difference between the 3 games in its namesake
Vivix: are you talking about 1-3 or 4+?
but SP campaign might count as different-
lol
Well I played the old cods, but CoD4 is like playing a onetrack oldschool MP game
i cant believe how much gaming has gone downhill
no goal, just--fight
Lawl
and that can be a ton of fun
Just because it's mainstream doesn't mean it's bad.
It just means that it's very popular in today's society.
I think game industry has gone uphill, but that's it's as slow as it used to be with good titles spread far between
the only cod game I care about is world at war, just for nazi zomies. and yes. zombies sucked in black ops.
Although some things don't really deserve popularity........
CCCP, yes, totally
I do stick by, if it's popular, it's popular for a reason, so I usually don't rag on that
FreeFall29 it was good in black ops I think..
CCCP: Agreed.
/me hitting Vivix
MakerDusk: hey can you make me some dusk?
/me cries
Only Jmo can hit me ;__;
i`m a secret agent so i hit Vivix :D
6my ass and the teacher just said "Are you guys sick or something?" truth is she hadn't even heard the music..I was all hunched up,trying to muffle the sound from the phone..She was staring at me and I thought she was just giving me the chance to turn it of with out her saying anything..Instead she just asked me if I was ok..I managed to turn the thing off in
6the end.. x)
/me licks Vivix
;__;
6Suinide! :D
6*hugs8
/me latches unto JMo
6**
hey suinude!
JFK reloaded is bad game never play it, it's offensive
u know him/her?
/me hits Vivix because i`m a secret agent
/me rips off secret agent badge off of derpherp. Now you're no longer a secret agent
6Yeah ^^
Just the name makes me not want to play it
Hiya *hugs*
I'm safe!
awesome :p
bk n thats starting to look good Wrek ^-^
6The beginning of that sentence looks pretty weird.."my ass and the teacher just said.."? Fail xD
More brownies should read home stuck
But--gaming hasn't gone downhill in my opinion. Not only is tech developing, but storytelling is- we are lacking in the adventure and old school story heavy stuff, but those things are coming back slowly
6How've you been? :3
hacking your computer hacking your computer i`m a detectime so i`m hacking your computer
CCCP: I didn't know brownies could read
How is Homestuck? Is it good?
FreeFall damn auto correct
I mean Moonstuck.
I love home stuck secret
Lol how do you i feel when its the first thing i saw? Ive been breathing if that even counts as good :/. You?
Ly*
05sketch more or less done
I've never read Homestuck, but I liked Moonstuck
/me a new agent badge appears on me
CCCP: Not really a secret anymore, now is it? :D
Wrek looking good Wrek- seriously reminds me of the sketches from DnD Monster manual
Homestuck is overrated garbage that people force down others' throats in order to feel like they have some superior knowledge and can act deep and edgy.
Vivix: What's Moonstuck about?
In a nutshell.
AJIsAwesome|Homework, Woona stuck on the moon, goes for the cutesy style and such
/me hits Vivix with a crowbar becuase i`m a detective
6x) :O >.< I'm fine,thx :P
stopeeet ;__;
Vivix: That's it?
Goodie, hows this chat been?
/me smacks derpherp
GTFO
Well- she's doing stuff, but I kinda fell off a while ago
Well AJIsAwesome you guys arnt people so I win!
It's like a --game
I see cades, dont believe ive seen it before
I see we're getting a little excessive with the RP today........

/me gets ass kicked in stupid useless hated gears of war
6How do you delete the list thing that comes up when you type something in a search bar thingie?
6o.o
idk haha
I`M A SECRET AGENT SO I HIT U WITH A CROWBAR PEACE lol nu peace
I'm thinking I should put in a dual-core processor so I can use Google Hangout's camera options.
Idk
so stream ended?
6I had looked it up a while ago,followed the steps but it didn't work.. ._.

Bronysith: classics, more like the pinnacle of rpg's
Hey, Dken2021
Ryunosuke ikr?
Dken2021: Hello! :)
Then I shall play them!

Freefall29: my point still stands
Anyone play CSGO?
the pinacle of RPG depends on RPG type
..
CCCP: play chrono trigger first
6 (3, in the states) is a big deal.
thats better
I am a fan of WRPG and- it didn't work for me
hipster cat likes evil characters before they were cool
anyway there is no stream atm?
Lunar was a good series.
6Standing on tiptoe for five minutes yesterday sure gave me some exercise.. ._.
AJIsAwesome|Homework: basically a guy who is extremely famous on the internet for no good reasons
huh, discussing RPGs eh?
Dovah: Fus ro -fraid not
i`m a secret agent and i`m sitting on Vivix :D
for anybody who's wondering, yeah. no stream atm.
AJIsAwesome|Homework: he reviews viral videos and gets 5 million views each vid he puts out
Heey THat's Jmo's spot
ffffffffff
Rhino March by Ponies_r_Lame? Centepede Episode #7... EWWWWWW?
6Just a specific one..I tend to like some evil characters :3
He stopped being fun a while ago
6xDD
Bronysith okay!
Hm?
Bronysith: So he's a brony hater now?
No-one takes my spot.
I like most of them way more than any lil hero
Which one :P
and that would be?
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9wk5bdx901rywedzo1_500.jpg
I made a blanket hat and everything
AJIsAwesome|Homework: he posted a music video and it showed a pole dancing pony
I just drew this 8)
That's not hating-
AJIsAwesome|Homework: and a guy in a shirt saying brony, jacking off to it
Bronysith: .....................
Way
Well, that's satire-
6I need to find a better way to phrase my question so I can google it.. -.-
Wat*
haha thats awesome :P
Bronysith: :'(
i dont know who that is :P
6Niaa! It's so cute! :D
Bronysith who does that? sounds like a youtube partner
He's always been kind of a dick, but I don't think that really goes under anti
6*squish*
Bronysith: What video is it?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: idk, remember seeing it before though
6Evil characters just have that badassness about them..it's usually impossible to resist their awesomeness xD
ok that newsletter was pretty funny
Shullllkkkkkkk
new newsletter?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: just trying to forget it
/me calls Vivix
Yes, hello?
Bronysith: Okay. Sorry about that.
6I keep forgetting what I want to do.. ._.
so. anybody got any good links?
search on google for whatever?
Just noise
6Cades,was the "Which one :P" going for me? x)
Who wants my cheese pizza?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIsh1J4FbKU
Ooh newsletter
oh, so they finally have a show name now, pixel perfect pony
CCCP: meeee
yeah :P
Ok I believe this could be a good time to test something with the community
hm?
/me watches all the chaos
BladedWings get ready for 20 years in prison
D=?
ughhhhhhhhhh. remember when you payed full price for a game and you actaully got a complete game? i miss those days
CCCP: oh crap! you tricked me!
Allright guys if I say My Little Dashie what will you guys say?
Bronysith, ya, I do
I wouldn't really say anythin
Never read it, heard mixed reviews about it.
ahhh skyrim How I love that game :)
CrimsonPhoenix: a fanfic
I rememer it, and I still do it Bronysith
meh
The only thing I REALLY miss, are manuals and boxart
he looks like a badass
How about Past Sins
^
Bronysith: yeah. these days you pay 40-60 bucks for a game (mass effect 3) and they have the balls to remove content from it and release it as DLC
Hi everypony
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO..............
me too Bronysith, even if it sucked, at least the devs gave it their all
hi DerpyMuffins
never read
Haven't read past sins yet, will soon
Freefall29: not just taht game
BladedWings >:3
/me hits Derpy with a crowbar because i`m a secret agent
DerpyMuffins: Hi!
havent read Past Sins
hi DerpyMuffins
Freefall29: try every single game that ever comes out by EA
derpherp: D:
look at games like
I eat secret agents :)
and now Background Pony
So what we watching?
6DDD:
EA != Gaming Industry
ello there DerpyMuffins
Derpy_Hooves: nothing
Freelancer, X3
/me glitches
complete games on launch
CrimsonPhoenix: Lyra and Octavia
BladedWings, no spoilers
Most games are complete on launch, dragging out the ones that aren't as examples is silly
I'm only at chapter 2
6I'd say he is :P Don't know his character too much yet :P
no special cutscenes
You know what? EA wasn't always this way. They used to be a productive member of the industry.
oh....
CrimsonPhoenix: Probably that even though the fanfic is okay, MLD is highly overrated and has WAY too much attention.
no FUCKING GOLDEN AMMO
grrr
glitching is fun, glitching is fun, i`m as secret agent so i`m glitchinh again
AJIsAwesome|Homework, Past Sins
6He'll probably be back soon :3
Kandarihu, EA also used to be serious, they helped develop AIFF file format
6*waits*
CrimsonPhoenix: How is My Background Pony?
i miss eldude :P
CrimsonPhoenix: ohhh, nevermind XD
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm not sure about Past Sins, I haven't read that.
/me nomths Vivix
he hasn't been on for a long time
6WOOS
So far Background Pony is awesome
/me cuddles Jmo and blastes Merzbow into his head
6Wb ^^
You all wish you had this.
;~;
hehe
I read two chapters and in two chapters there was a story with deep thoughts coming from it.
I think we need to figure out how EA went from a good company to a maglignant tumor of the industry.
I thought the grey man got you, Suinide
The writing is beautifull
DAT LINK
VIVIX Y U SCARE ME WIT DAT PIC ON DA MERZBOW DANG! :D
CrimsonPhoenix: Hmm.......what's the synopsis?
We don't need to figure it out, it just happened
i mean D:
I seriously recommend Backgrounf Pony over anything
derpherp, sorry ;__; I like the music
Kandarihu I think around the time DLC was announced
wut music?
ze noiiise darling
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/Background-Pony
lol...creepy
Hullo.
Read it there
or when they bought the madden license, whichever
it pretty much says everything
/me 6is in the mood of spamming evil dude pictures
I dunno if I want to read that one
its not so much that I hate dlc per se, but when you make the core game dls (story important characters) you tend to piss off the fans eventually, and golden ammo (OP guns, equips, etc) that can be bought for RL cash as part of promotions that can be used in MP, do absolutely NOTHING but piss off the people that doesnt have it
I can think of two things that happened with EA, that might have given the company a massive God-Complex. Getting the exclusive license to the NFL is one.
6xD
the description didn't capture me
6Ok,that sounded kinda bad..
Grey man?
Vivix, it's amazing
DAT HAD NO MUSIC!
IT DAT GLITCHY SCAREY THINGY!
6Aha..found one..
All you need to do is to throw aside all the fanon around Lyra first
CrimsonPhoenix, it might be- but it don't sound like my kinda thing- how she writes to youu and how she acknowledges she is a background pony in the description just don't sound like my kinda thing
cause it's a whole new character
The grey mans from a game called LSD.
on a side note
Vivix, she knows that she's a pony like any other
The other is the fact that they didn't support the Sega Dreamcast, and the Dreamcast crashed and burned, and this was largely attributed to EA not publishing games on their console.
Ubisoft said that they are ditching the always on DRM
it's not really a break the fourth wall
something about fans being pissed off and all that
heck it's a Journal type of story
not working
etc
The grey man is sexy
VIVIX DAT ONG GLITCHY THING DATS SCARY AND DA SCARY OICTURES IN MEH HEAD AND I~M GOING CRAZYYYYY
Needs moar 80s! This needs to be the 80s!
CrimsonPhoenix, okay- well maybe, but yeah- description didn't capture me right away. It might still be good, just not my taste
all she says is that she has a curse
really? Ubisoft? well they may have won somebody today
gaming has gone downhill so fucking much
Dunno
derpherp, hehe, glitch and noise can be wonderful. Merzbow is very hit or miss, some of his stuff is just stupid, and some sound--really mezmerizing
no stream it seems
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62IR-bs4hNo
I don't agree Bronysith, that's what kids say about music, and they are all wrong
Link every thing from the 80s!
http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/05/ubisoft-scrapping-always-on-drm-for-pc-games/
CrimsonPhoenix: I hav to agree with Vivix, I'm not sure if this is something I would really read. Yes, it seems really good but I'm not really into this kind of stuff.
*have*
lol
CCCP Leggins, hot leggings!
6Ok,time to think of another
Lol
VIVIX U OWE MEH !) AWSOME SONG YOUTUBE LINKS AND A TEADY BEAR!
well for those that want sometihng sad
Go with Background Pony
derpherp, what do you like? Calm music?
Vivix: downhill in terms of difficulty and challenge i should say
Vivix: uphill in handholding easy as all balls
Well--maybe, maybe not
6Pff..wish I was in the mood to draw.. -.-
When will Mike be up? :c
some games have totally abandoned the super hard like
morrowind finding shit, and point and click adventure
That picture him?
Wow. Gertmanian is going to be selling officially licensed My Little Pony Friendship is Magic rugs.
I think Betehsda is really bad at making those sorta things, and that even Morrowind had some issues that they carried on into all their games
Kandarihu: Guess I'm going to Gertmanian. :D
so, anyone know if java is safe to use now?
6Do you have a dA account? :3
but- you know, each their own
Java should be safe if updated
i do believe im back

I draw A LOT
Oh I don't have anything like that derpherp -
About Lyra recognizing she's a background pony.....i just read the 1st chapter
I like sad fanfics more than most ones
im a fan of rainbow factory
I really like sad
i suck at drawing :P
but it's hard to find good sad
00,03While I was waiting for my next class, I read The Last Sonic Rainboom. It was... short
Dark92Enigma, any thoughts?
wut duh fuq is dat Bladed ._.
6I was drawing something but something about it bothers me and Idk how to fix it so I've kinda stopped lately..But the last 3 months I had been drawing quite a bit..
I prefer slice of lifes, comedy, adventure, a bit of dark (not too much though)
I like dark, romance, adventure and sad
you know
That's good.
not really comedy fan outside of cartoons
the best fanfic I have read was "a"
I like sad fanfics with a touch of adventure
:p
I like Princess Molestia Fanfic
OK WILL WE STOP TALKIN BOUT FANFICS
If I'm going to read fanfics, I would probably say that I would like slice of life, comedy, adventure, and normal.
NEVAH
Y </3
neverwas in the fics, but I might give it a chance, I just have way too many in queue
CrimsonPhoenix: it was deep.......and that was the 1st chapter
dang
derpherp: that my friend is music...good music ^_^
i thougt tat would work
Dark92Enigma, YES Someone that can vouch me on Background Pony
Dken2021: Me neither. I've been trying t get into them lately.
http://youtu.be/suTA005tavk this is the closest I have to that kinda music, excluding pony derpherp
6:3
*to*
Well I said it before and I'll say it again, I don't read fanfics that much but I do enjoy Crioton's stuff
thank you
princess molestia is a good fanficiton, that is great and highly detailed
which one Bronysith?
HEY
Idon't think I'll ever take a look at a fanfic with the word "Molest" in the title
WAT AM I THINKIN BOUT
yeah I read that one Bronysith
Prince_Lightboom being loud?
Vivix: and lunaughty?
no
I dunno, I thought it was - interesting, but it used to be tagged Teen and had--it was as if everything was withou genitalia
watching pewdiepie
it was kinda odd, but interesting story
Yeah I read Lunaughty too, same deal- Interesting story
may someone play pewdiepie plzzz
The LAST one, about twilight lost me completely, I was bored halfway thru the first two chapters-
The thing is i read sad fanfics with sad BGM from any anime: Dragon Ball Z / Saint Seiya / Sailor Moon
as BGM
Vivix u give me 10 song youtube links of songs liek dis:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA3O7V_yVcA :D
where's umm
MAY WE WATCH SOME PEWDIEPIE
I like reading while listening to shoegaze and huge stuff
To make it match with the moment
PESDIEPIE
who hates EA with a burning passion of 1000 stars?
Prince_Lightboom: They'll request when they want to.
either it's a sad, heartwarming moment, or a cliffhanger
PEWDIEPIE
Ryunosuke: i dont
Ryunosuke: i hate them with a burning passion of 10000000000000000000000000 stars
and one thing Vivix
:|
I dont dislike Pewdiepie but I don't think he's that good...
Wish i could draw :/
http://www.destructoid.com/ea-boss-proudly-refuses-to-publish-single-player-games-234402.phtml

#djvynle
seeya Dark92Enigma
Bye dark92Enigma
derpherp, http://youtu.be/HypcjdSNsAQ http://youtu.be/LgTpCmEW94I would be the closest I got- unless I have to dig through glitch synths-
EA already has an MMO, Ultima Online, and they want ALL their games to be psuedo-mmo's
not really the same
GLITCHES :D
wut kind of glitches u speak of O3O
so time for uncomfortable talk, what u guys think of R34?
CCCP, Pewdie? The best series he ever made, in my opinion, was to the moon. He actually seemed like he enjoyed it, but he seems kinda sick of horror
Here guys, have some awesome music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP0f5rvVkAU&hd=1
It make sad that not a lot of games have cheats anymore.. :(
Bronysith: Let's not go there.......
modern*
play plz > http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRqayjGOpYc <
Well, the only opinion on R34 for that matters is your own, so no- useless discussion
Bronysith: This really isn't the place for this.
AJIsAwesome|Homework: good point
Rule 34? Uhhh...."Hey look a moose!"
VIVIX wut kind of glitches u speak of of glitch synths?
CCCP, me too- I miss consoles
Glitches--uhh..
JESmith71 swerve outta the way.,!
Random question: What's your favorite kind of pancakes?
wut r glitch synths Vivix?
/me dies from moose in road
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gyZ8I6P65g like this derpherp
especially around 4 minute mark
bing me if u say something to me im watchin pewdiepie
00,03Does anyone here listen to Basshunter?
CCCP, and by consoles I mean--dev consoles- with cheats and commands and whatnot-
Scoot-Scootaloo: Somewhat
i wish i actually enjoyed drawing
My favorite kind of pancakes are Bacon Pancakes or Chocolate Chip pancakes.
dis is
00,03also pewdiepie sucks :|
Not really Scoot-Scootaloo
Vivix I know :3
:3
Scoot-Scootaloo, I listen to his swedish songs
DA BEST MUSIC WIT GLITCH SYNTHS EVA!
I don't really like him, not my kinda stuff
Scoot-Scootaloo: Who's Basshunter?
Anna er en bot
derpherp: Which song?
a song abou CS
00,03Anyways, I'm looking for the swedish version of All I ever Wanted, do you know where I can find it?
i miss the SNES and the NES and n64 and ps1 and ps2
00,03that's not on youtube...
I admit to watching Jenna Marbles..
but wut r da glitch synths supost ta mean
00,03or maybe a youtube link or something
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OzWIFX8M-Y
Damn connection
lol
ooooooh
Scoot-Scootaloo oh, you listen to the stuf my old roomate would put on alot
derpherp, glitching synths are synths that..are made to fail or break up in certain ways- in unmusical ways- circuit bending or just weird patches and settings
well......
it's supposed to sound destroyed and ruined, glitching
Wish i had the guts to write
00,03Oh that's it....?
yeah
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh.........I've heard that song before.
it's the same beat
00,03Huh... I thought it would be... cooler
hehe
but
Dota is cool
Who's supposed to be streaming?
The only really famous youtuber that I never found slightly funny was Fred, luckily no one cares about him anymore.
Hehe
derpherp: PinkiePieSwear is damn good at using glitching in his songs
whaaa!!
a lot of the old youtubers are gone
CCCP: Was he funny at all?
You should hear about the swedish version of while your gone
My team is cs go is so baaadd.
derpherp: Example: Sunshine and Celery Stalks
my favourite youtuber is Sips and Sjin- calmest sexiest voices out there
Oh well. I am having fun.
even crius croker?
while You're gone
6I wish I could write with more detail in school shit.. x)
AJIsAwesome nope
Not a bad person, just not funny...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf2wbRWb9xI
yah like if i take a missing no and mix mix mix it wit a song like a yoshi island song i`ll get glitch synths?
00,03isn't it now your gone?
nope
it's about a bot in IRC
CCCP: And can you believe that they gave him his own show AND three movies?
Phase4:
Hey people. ._.
JRPHONE,
hey icefang!
very fitting
Hmm
derpherp, ehm...maybe- glitching is a technique- it's hard to explain. but for instance glitching synths as in circuit bending is--destroying something- just a sec
Half of my favorite online game hates me now.
00,03Barrington Levy?
Ce..
Ice...*
IM BAK
<.<
Vivix if i took a yoshi island song and put missingno together with it i`ll get glitching synths
6Hiya ^^
Practically because I played a villain and decapitated a leader but so what e.e
still nothin
...
6o.o
hi Prince_Lightboom
right?
AJIsAwesome I actually watched one of the movies because I'm stupid I wanted to see if it was really bad, but was surprised at how bad it was.
ill be bak if i hear pewdiepies voice here
And hai. :3
don't think that will happen
00,03We don't take too kindly to pewdiepie here...

00,03Anyways, speaking of streams...
derpherp, noo- not really- eh glitching is a technique- like beat hopping and mixing in harshnoise and such-
Hmm...
6Like a boss seems pretty appropriate here somehow.. x3
Scoots how about Nova?
CCCP: I literally couldn't stand to watch any of the episodes. I tried watching JUST one, and I was sick of it in five minutes.
I'm trying to find a glitching nintendo synth
00,03Nova kicks ass!
:D
Yay
x3

Well, some people in children's entertainment have no understanding of how kids think or what they might like. As long as it doesn't have any objectionable material, if the music is nice and bouncy, it's good for the kids. Right?
oh god

Helga G. Patacki
tSparx: who hates white turkey, its ham that has no flavour
basically, its the sound transformers make when they have sex
Mr. Simmons. Lol.
Kandarihu And if he were to troll us, he'd take a name insultingly similar name to his real name and refuse to blow his cover :$
O.O
Ham is better that Turkey
superretroworld: Unless it's a |Honey Baked Ham
Amen Harold
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB76MjtDPSU
I'm not one to like turkey, but my favorite kind of turkey is fried turkey.
<.<
amen, now give me that turkey
White Turkey < Decent Ham < Dark Turkey < Good Ham < Steak
JESmith71: only if its deli aka sliced ham
Turkey is delicious. And it's the only thing that's truly fat-free
Now I'm really hungry
YUM YUM YUM YUM
this is raw, unedited audio of 2 transformers having sex
Fsteak
tSparx, if he has no sense of stealth. And trolling us while going by a similar name to his real one? That would be close to suicide.
/me Belly rumbles

MASF123: On the other hand, it's really easy to block out smoke. You can probably stuff the offending openings for smoke with toilet paper to keep it out.
Yes they were/
XD
flutterchu: How did you get banned?
that sounds like me
Oh, the sincerity of a 10 year old girl.
LunarRepublicGuard so what does that mean?
Dken2021: and 'gulp' one direction

You can call me whatever you like lol
wow, they totally dissed Brittney spears, lol

I can't stand Muffy

Wait, is this the whole episode?!
Id Sellout and host a brony convention
Do we need to shorten my name?
Dken2021: just be glad you dont know them
AJIsAwesome|Homework: i dont know why
Muffy is so spoiled.
AND NOW, A WORD FROM US KIDS
Mr. Malk, I knew there was a reason I hired you. Have a raise!
Muffy's my least favorite character of the show...
BladedWings: She's so underground, Knuckles could take lessons from her. :D
Sometimes I want to punch her
I always thought the tall one was ugly.
:D
/me likes the Backstreet Boys. :3
Wait, is this a special?
dat Buster
goddammit arthur
Dreamcrusher
I found them okay, I just hated the obsessive fans. :|
/me same here.
you overzealous dumbass anteater
and boom! they were dead.
YAY tSparx now I can afford a sticker thanks tSparx
I like Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara, but Muffy Crosswire is such a bitch. Just like D.W.
Pfft Backstreet Boys
Dat singing
i know medley of ytpmv BEAT THAT
Spice Girls were all the fuzz in the 90s
...Oh god. D.W....the one character that I hated more than Muffy.
Never heard them, haven't heard the name in like over a decade
MrMalk think of it on a political point of view :)
Can I put your heart in my unicalade while it's still beating? o__o
That Sharon Lois and Bram song
Dat gong
You hated D.W, LadyCanary?
I NEVER liked D.W. :S
GONG'd. You fail DW
I just made myself feel old by using the word decade
I found DW to be a fairly realistic little sister
:O the Elephant Song...how long has it been since I last heard that?
I TOLD YOU NOT TO.....Touch it! :[
SpeedyBolt: She was quite annoying, yes. >_>
She kinda reminds me of when I was young.
:D GONGED
It's the only boy band that I can stand, at least they have songs WITH MEANINGS! A giant eff you to other boy bands.

6pri
MASF123: God that episode gave me nightmares...
I remember when Power Rangers first premiered.
MASF123: Lots and LOTS of nightmares...
I still think of the 90s as last decade
I figured it'd get cancelled in a few weeks
Its weird
dat offer
Who can pass up that offer? :3
Binky is a funny ass name.
but i predict the movie was fucked up
Snacks and Guitar, that IS a good deal.
DocSane: And yet it's dodged cancellation two or three times
dat artistic integrity
And still going
Dem negotiation skills
:( I cant see the keyboard enough to type my comments in time :D
SpeedyBolt: What about profit?
Dat Gibson.
Profit?
Buster got his own spin-off weird because Arthur ran longer and still got more views.
What about her?
i remember that song being in the 20th youtube video ever uploaded
oh boy, here comes the cacophony of animal shatter crap
So the LunarRepubicGuard so dont they rule together?
Mmmm....Donuts. :3

Something something darkside.

The CMC were better than this.

/me prefers scootaloo
Funny enough, Francine CAN sing. She just cant sing with her drums.

i want to see trixie do on the big screen agian in season 3
They must be using the make 'em wait tactic
lol
francine sucks she could have broght her family out of lowerclass
With no new episodes, bronies will eventually fade away. D:
take my bits and make season 3 :|
This show is the Simpsons of PBS, espectially with SO many pop culture refferences.
MASF123 eh, the fandon could keep it alive some
VenHur well said
flutteryay: Don't worry, they will be airing it this fall.
maybe but there's still a lot to do with the current episodes
flutterchu: A Great thought... But i think Trixie was a one episode character.
6>.<
TO LONG OF WAIT D:
You s*muffle*
VenHur and I think it's still showing new episodes to this day
WHAT THE CRAP IS THIS?!
ARTHUR?!
Dken2021, "All good things must come to an end."

WindWhistler: Yep.
/me foams at the mouth
:D that Principle
Not this thread again
BACKSTREET BOYS?!
ello WindWhistler
Did they really say that?
lauren faust & takeshi sudo are best creators
the one channel that aired FIM in this country doesn't even show it anymore
They made a reference to a real live band?
SINCE WHEN DO THEY DO THAT?!
flutteryay: Just letting you know, we may get into debates, but they don't last long. :D
They don't do that anymore.
WindWhistler they were on the on the show
lauren faust is a goddess in the animation world
I think licenses are running out in their attempt to make iTunes and Netflix and such get an international launch of it
I request that will all debate! :[
Spitfire: and takeshi sudo
everytime someone says god im informed
WindWhistler: That's horrible :'(
wut :I
Spitfire: i mean shudo
alot of that happened to members
There are many great people in the Animation World
Vivix agreed.
BACK
DONT WANT, NOTHIN BUT THE MUSIC
DHX Media itself houses so many talented animators
what the heck is this?
This is messed up
Pixar is also a godo one

ooh yeah Pixar is good
A cider-enduced dream
my mom just gave me a hug fest :|

flutteryay: Why?
I AM THE GOD OF POPCORN
Canada has a great animation scene compared to many countries
She grew bewbs! :O
because she wanted to tell me she loved me so much
popcorn hurts my throat
flutteryay: Okay. :D
screw u
my pinkie pie fell asleep
Why does this evern happen? Is it too much heartboner? Because I stopped recording? Because for so long I'm the only one who's heard it?
lol xD F
:D
ok, somebody ping me when this is over! please
:D
popcorn makes the universe go round
The only way I see is to get rid of your fetish, and I don't think an effective method exists.
While the rabbit farts in the corner

Flootahshy: :D

Popcorn_Monster: Why not?

he'd need high expectations to enjoy this shit
its shizu
MASF123 that...would be weird
Your unlce jack is stuck on his roof
SpeedyBolt: I think DW got a massive upgrade, if that was the case
Would you helpo your unlce jack off
NO
YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE WORTHLESS

Popcorn_Monster: wait a second. Isn't that from the EQD Writer's guide?

ah, understood scoots
D:
Crazy bus, crazy bus~
It looks like it was made in the 90's.
NOOOO

No D:
YAY! THE BUFFER SHOW!
crazy bus is my bus
the pain never stops
it only slows

whats wrong with stream
OH THIS IS MY FAVORITE EPISODE!
WindWhistler: it was
Arthur always looked the same, no matter what year it was made.
cliffhanger
Stream is dead.
13Wirisme: it's that... heh... buffer zone of the 90s
13er
13WindWhistler:
spitfirecolt1 scoots had to go
what is HAPPENING :'(
Oh well, time to check out EQD
ah i miss scoots already
I like how the buffer circle is perfectly around his eye
the buffer show is happening!

13george is concerned about the circles assaulting his eyeball
Hey look it's a moose
-sigh-
flutteryay: The streamer had to go. so we wait
iIT WAS A MOVIE!!!!
oh
I wish I could be a streamer
Ohh great, buffer, buffer, buffer...
OWWW I BIT MY THUMB
Teacher's Pet the movie had better quality than this.
so eny one go to dragon con
flutteryay: It will only be a moment or so.:$
I take it only mods can stream?
Even though it's called Arthur the show doesn't only revolve around him. Great if only EVERY show did that.
geoge's thoughts: only the dead can know peace from this buffer
Although you all might be weirded out by what I'd stream
Anyone know a good B movie?
XDD

Evening Fellow Bronies
Dken2021, Maya's not real so I can't.
FusRohYAY_87: Hi! :)
hey isnt season 3 epi 1 saposed to come out on saturday
scout19_tf2 no ones knows sadly
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
no it's not.
still unknown
sonicandmario85: i meant like buying newer hardware in the near future. I did something similar to what you said though XD At my workplace, I have a ton of IBM T42s and they were made for XP back in 05 and I got Windows 7on them. I was surprised that those things could even run it :D
PinkieDinky:im SOOOOOOO happy
oh man, I think it's using actual 3D models instead of sprites http://derpy.me/sUg4V
:'( atill dont know when they'll air the next season :'(
Not even Tom knows when the next episode air time is. D:
So I was thinking. It's SlurryMoon's Birthday today. Wouldn't it be cool if he were to stream for us? It's been ages since he last streamed.
FusRohYAY_87: Probably in the fall.
do anypony know the date of mlp s3?
how does no one know it ses on saturdays in september
no
Dken2021: twas announced on court-records
Rumoprs are they start at the beginning of OCt
Kandarihu: Trye. But I'll probably be asleep by then.
they usually do tat
oni_link:my dad cant afford new hardware worst part is this computer is designed for windows 98 and im running xp on it this was made before xp even came out
Only The Hub knows.
Dken2021: Looks similar to his MvC character model :P
Don't believe rumors. Most of them turn out to be false.
Yeah.
Celestias trolling us :$
Only the Hub knows when.
I would've asked earlier, but I had to go afk a lot, and didn't want to miss anything if SlurryMoon were to stream.
EVERYPONY POINT YOUR HOOVES YELL OBJECTION AS LOUD AS YOU COULD (bad rap)
Kandarihu: WHat did SlurryMoon use to stream?
all I know is, I have a reason to own a 3DS immidietly
well im still checking on the hub on saturday
oni_link:when i try running TF2 it says memory cannot be read i dont remember the error code things on it
scout19_tf2: wait till they announce it, man
sonicandmario85: the fact that its lasted you this long is amazing all in its own :) but yeah you could get yourself a decent and fairly new barebones kit for around $325
just found out michael clarke duncan died, he was a great actor :(
I had to prepare dinner for once, since my mom had a terrible headache.
im also exited for the professor layton crossover with ace attorney even though all i know of it was i watched a movie
they have announced it
Kandarihu: how did that go?
oni_link:my dads broke from that vacation in flagstaff we had
oni_link, it went well, but mom helped a lot.
he doesnt have much money left
The entire Internet will be ablaze.
all the tv schedules are not announcing a new ep saturday
Oni-channn when u gonna air the next episode :S
tSparx: Yep. Probably 150+ people. :D
dat trixie
The entire Internet is *already* ablaze, and there hasn't been an announcement yet xD
sonicandmario85: oh well just know that its a possibility :P
rofl that trixie is pro
tSparx: Maybe even 200+ people here.
oni chan,dan:NOW YOU FUCKED UP
Kandarihu: so she pretty much supervised :P
afaik, sat eps are Ticket master, Best Night EVER, and Canterlot Wedding parts 1&2
AJIsAwesome: Yeah, there's no way I'll be around for long that day xD
AJIsAwesome, SlurryMoon would stream Youtube videos of his choosing, but one time, he streamed his physical modification of a fighting game stick. That was an interesting time.
But ONichAN!!!!
oni_link, only for the fish.
ok on utube look up mlp season 3 there will be 2 vids saying its on sat
Kandarihu: ah
Kandarihu: Hmm, sounds nice. I really would like to see him stream. :)
13DERP
Kandarihu I think that was DCD that did the fighting stick
and you trust EVERYTHING on youtube wholehartedly?
:D
13today shizu learned that f5 forces a reconnect
scout19_tf2: Once again, only the HUB knows.
poor Shizuka
They'll announce the next season when they want to.
season 3 trixie is gonna be a boss http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8mbgkeQaq1rs6uheo1_500.jpg
or when the tv listings show
only 2 songs have been release 4 s3 mlp
everyone seeing those posts about waiting for season 3?
no spoilers
FusRohYAY_87: Yep.
flutterchu: Oi!
Just skeletons at computers
flutterchu:so is trixie not gonna be a bitch when she comes back?
Dken2021, oh, right. Okay. Was it SlurryMoon who streamed Mother 3 for a fundraiser last year, which played after pony episode premiers?
flutterchu: Don't post Ssn3 stuff on here!
yes and there kick ass
Halt es!
Kandarihu dunno, I don;t think I was there for that
flutterchu: is trixie not gonna be a bitch in season 3?
I think either Trixie or Gilda should have a redemtion episode.
tSparx: i cant post season 3 spoilers but i can spoil ace attorney 5 ?
*redemption*
flutterchu: Did you read the rules?
also
flutterchu: One of those is against the rules of this channel. The other is about ace attorney 5.
They should end season 3 with an invasion of all the past villans of MLP and have them destroy Ponyville with a cliffhanger ending of the season
the Gilda Redemption
*That's right, you'd better run.*
scout19_tf2, /r/mylittlepony has NOTHING on S3 episodes yet
flutterchu well if this were a ace attorney fan site, we might have a different tune
:P
and if ANYONE would have anything on s3, reddit would
ANY DISCUSSION OR SPOILERS OF SEASON WILL RESULT IN A BAN/KICK.
its funny no one eva reads da rules first
fusRohYAY_87: O_o
*SEASON 3*
i didnt read that one :(
AJIsAwesome, discussion is fine, just no spoilers :)
buuuuut the songs
wa we cant discuss it? its not real, only rael thing are the songs
well discussion is technically off limits
speculations hmmm
Ryunosuke: "Discussion of anything related to S3 will result in a ban." --The channel's topic.
Everyonr talking about the two forbidden words...
Better hide
we should go on a strike till they make more episodes
I see that, however, I dont think discussing WHEN s3 will air constitutes what they are saying
hell yea
tSparx: sorry PLEASE DONT BAN ME *cries*
I think they mean ep discussions etc
damned fire alarms
as in content
tSparx: anyone on the site embed chat doesnt see the topic by default
I GTG D:
flutterchu: I'm not a mod. I can't ban you :P
bbl
superretroworld that would end badly like the sonic 4 boycott
nooooo forgive me :'(
:'( bye
Spectrum_Rush: 'Swhy I quoted it :)
Dken2021: what happened there?
Yeah. The timing of S3 is perfectly okay to discuss. Episodes of S3 that have already aired (after a certain time) are okay. If we're still waiting for it, it's off limits.
bye princess!
superretroworld the fans were enraged how sonic 4 looked, and tried to boycott sega... by purchasing any sonic 1 port
tSparx: yes... but your quote will be lost to the flow of thae chat to anyone joining just after :)
srry everypony bout da spoilin i know were all waiting despritly for it
Spectrum_Rush: But I wasn't talking to them. I was talking to the people already here :)
i thought i died form wrek's ban hammer :'(
so im guessing we can talk abotu the songs?
Okay on XChat how do I change the sounds for my pings?
scout19_tf2: Hahaha no.
FusRohYAY_87 no songs or anything
*cry
http://i.imgur.com/b7QFy.jpg - I approve of this
/me actually likes Sonic 4
13feel the magic
tSparx: then what do the people that come later do huh, why u no think about them :|
psycho?
the magiks
seriously it was the most stupidest thing the sonic fandom has done
woona? atleast she changed her mane
Best sonic was Sonic 3 and Knuckles
tSparx: dont ban me :'(
boycotting a company by buying a past product made my that company
Dken2021: nice fans
ok new convo wunderful weather havin right
LunarRepublicGuard: I don't have colour-text, I'm not a mod. I cannot ban you :)
I love s3&k but I always think it's way too long when I play it
I like em all except for the very first one. And by all of them, I mean all of the Genesis titles
Und dann all the newies were afraid of tSparx XD
tSparx: im in a worse posision if wrek ban's me heel ban me permanitly!!!!!!
best feeling was when you got a Chaos Emerald
ah, did like sonic3k, but I always liked 2
2 is awesome
Spectrum_Rush: I like this, it feels good :)
probably my fav
Hyper Knuckles is PINK
Anyone here familiar with XChat?

"Godamned kids and their newfangled pokemons with thier stripes and spikes, when I was a kid, we only had 150 pokemon"
color text = mods *writes on notepad*
There ARE only 150 pokemon :[

Spectrum_Rush: If I were a mod, even, I'd be pretty quick to kick, not too quick to timeban, and I'd slow slow slow to permaban :$
wait!?! what about MEw!
Ryunosuke: yay
Spectrum_Rush: So they shouldn't fear me at all :P
ok I forgot mew
151 dude
FusRohYAY_87, mew who? :)

FusRohYAY_87: there was 150 then mew was added for a limited time now it's a glitch 0u0

twilight_sprinkle: Whoa there, man!
SuperBrony64: Sorry, tab fail. :$
twilight_sprinkle: Oh, the stream. Duh :P
Oh and Togepi counts too
tSparx: well theres more than that tbh.

twilight_sprinkle: ?
what does that say?
togepi was generation II
I would like to see an all spy match. I don't even think that's possible. :D
Even with cheats. :D
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=261 - for reference to my first statement :)
AJIsAwesome: atleast 16 episodes would do Dken2021 well i dont wanna close g4
AJIsAwesome: god, sappers everywhere
tSparx: well Federer just lost in the qf's of us open, but you probably dont follow tennis anyway
AJIsAwesome: Not impossible, just highly unlikely. :)
im imagining pewdiepie in a spy suit
NocturnalBlade|TF2: Sappers?
twilight_sprinkle: Lord, not at all, haha. I find it boring -- though I do like some boring sports, like curling and cycling :)
ryunosuke: <3 VG cats
AJIsAwesome: yea, spy sappers...you can sap robots lol

Fun fact: Gen II was supposed to be in Gen I. The developers did not have enough time to include all the Johto Pokemon but hackers have messed with the original Pokedex's coding and found that there was 252 pages.
Ryunosuke: is it bad i would've smacked a kid with that cane if'n they said Mew-who

He's pulling this bullshit that unless I turn my headphone volume down so he cant hear it he's gonna shut my computer down

Allo everyone.

Well, even more luckily, I no longer live at home :P

Hallo Meanwhile :)
Hola Meanwhile
tSparx don;t they have a master bedroom?
SpadeMagnes[R]: I'm sorry you're dad's being a but.
beep boop
Meanwhile: hello parking meter
/me throws a welcome pillow at Meanwhile
Meanwhile: Hi! :)
MvM shenanigans. They same to be missing a player.
SpadeMagnes[R], he's concerned about your own hearing. If you have your headphones up so loud that other people can hear it, then it's going to cause permanent damage to your hearing.
Dken2021: Y'know, tbh, Idk what the definition of a master bedroom, but they have our biggest bedroom, it takes up about a quarter of the basement.
And then when he gets into a argument with me he threatens to hit me!
Sup Meanwhile?
evening, everypony!
How old are you SpadeMagnes[R] ?
I took my headphones off to hear the volume, its not that loud
16
hai Sylandest
Sup Sylandest?

But enough of my own issues... how is everyone doing...
Sylandest: Yep. Finishing up some homework. :D
Dken2021: Yeah, they have the master bedroom then :) Though the bathroom's next door.
A-Ok.
Sylandest: How about you?

SpadeMagnes[R]: Very well, thanks :)

Okay.

Dken2021, well i heard an ambulance but i think that was unrelated
nooooo, too slow :(
Cya everypony
Phase4: So is everyone okay there?
i'm back in the building now so nothing too serious

oni_link remeber seeing a jsr on the forums
damn i got soda on this keyboard
Dken2021: haha well Ill just tell you. Hes the guy who made the program :)
o that sucks
flutterchu da'awwww
So I get that +o is for chanOps, what's +v stand for?
aww
oh I remeber now
+v is voice Wirisme.
flutterchu: That would make a GREAT duet in S3, IMO. :O
i mean tSparx.
DashWithRainbows: Voice?
what?
AJIsAwesome: thank you :$ id love that
is CSGO any good? heard its on psn and was thinkin of picking it up once my ps3 gets fixed
Sketch_Toku_Brony: What's it stand for?
Global Ops
Wirisme Sorry, thought his message was your message.
i think
np
what does that mean anyway?
Counter Strike Global Offense
o i c
tSparx Basically, when +m is in effect, those with + beside their name will still be able to talk, alongside those with @ and %
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I hear it's pretty good.. I'm not into military games.
DashWithRainbows: So you could talk to us right now?
from what i saw, CS:GO isnt much of an improvement from cs:source
Dken2021: Im glad those dudes arent total douchebags though. When theyre on theyre pretty cool people. If youre not paying attention though you will get lost in their conversations and jokes FAST XD they were really bored one time and they were acting as eachother. Oh and occasionally Mexican Sunflower gets on. He goes by meckz or something like that now :P
but cs:source was good.
despite capcom canceling megaman legends 3 and megaman universe and not putting him in mvc3.......TWICE ill give it a second chance
DashWithRainbows: I mean usermodes. I've +ix (though I don't think this channel recognizes +x mode), and +o is chanOps, so what's +v Voice mean?
fahahahahahahaha
wahahahahahahaha
tahahahahahaha
yahahahahahaahah
/me lurks in chat
13+x is your hostmask is obfuscated serverside
pahahahahahaha
i love capcom
sahahahahahaha
o_o
13+v is voice, as in you can speak while +m
gahahahahahaha
I bought CS:GO because I didnt own CS:S
jahahahahahaha

DashWithRainbows: Shizu thanks :)
++c is bad joke by me
jellyhahahahahahah
i like UMvC3 flutterchu one of my favorite fighters...capcom shenanagins or not
AJIsAwesome yeah same here but i figured if i were to play an online shooter then at least it'll be 15-20$ :D plus most game i have are mostly single :$
I think +i was invite only
Sketch_Toku_Brony: i like it too but my brother doesnt :'(
yohohohohohohohohoho
?
hayohayohayoha
isydfiqwbfviquwdfhbvewiufbh
wut do ya mean flutterchu?
Shizuka: +i means that only people in the same chan as you can find you in the channel's userlist
abc123
flutterchu used to like capcom too, but lately they've been doing really idiotic things lately
Sketch_Toku_Brony: he hates everything i like just because i like it
flutterchu: so...he hates ponies?
flutterchu sounds like my cousins
-sigh-
13i'm not a W+M1 pyro
NocturnalBlade|TF2: NOO IM IN <3 WITH FLUTTERSHY DONT YOU DARE SAY THAT AGIAN :[

flutterchu sounds like my nephew lol gets his flank handed to him in Dark Souls,doesnt like it and play Black Ops mostly :$
Shizuka: Stationary pyro is best pyro.
flutterchu : she was my fave in season 1
Maid_RainBow: she will always be the only pony that touched my heart
flutterchu: whoa whoa, calm down...i just asked if he hated ponies since you like ponies and you said your brother hates everything you like :( sorry i made ya mad
fluttershy -> pinkie -> dashie that's my favourite evolution
NocturnalBlade|TF2: yes he hates ponies
that's why i dont have a shirt
/me cowers in corner from flutterchu rage "thanks, i'll leave you be now"
NocturnalBlade|TF2: im nat rage im just crying
/me hugs flutterchu softly
/me hug "i'm sorry"
/me hugs flutterchu
flutterchu i feel the same pain
*pushes hugging pepole away* i dont apreciate any gifts unless i earn them
:(
flutterchu: It's considered rude in more formal parts of Western culture to refuse a gift.
tSparx: sorry
13hm
its cool flutterchu :) /)
flutterchu: yea, what Sketch_Toku_Brony said
nah you're supposed to refuse for a while then give in
On Steam, where do I go to look at the greenlight stuff again??

I can't think of a single US port of a UK show that went well, actually :P
Question: What's "Fan Service"?
...
Im not goign to asnwer that
MASF123: Things that writers do just to please the fans of the show
lol i know the feeling w/ Super Sentai and *shudders* power rangers...
MASF123: Often in anime taking the form of getting random pantie shots
DID HE REALLY SAY THAT
13which
He actually said that.
MASF123: Or gratuitous shots, lady stepping out of the shower, etc. etc. :P
13you didn't think they would show breastfeeding did you

13"glia" being a term for nervous tissue
Lol. I got the mythical Unicorn in RED DEAD REDEMPTION: UNDEAD NIGHTMARE, and I got the achievement, "Fan Service" can that be a reference to MLP?
For those of you too young to know, this is a parody of an old PBS show called This Old House about home repairs.
Hoi kirzstryfe :3
i just dont know what went wrong
13don't tell me this old house isn't still going
13pbs shows are incapable of ending! except wishbone :<
Shizuka, no idea.
Kandarihu Don't patronize the young :P I'm amazed by how much they know about pop culture that predates them.
I think they cancelled Nova too
ANyone answer my question?
ah man i remember wishbone :'( ah memories
13nova has to still be going i know it
Wishbone was awesome.
MASF123: Could be, but I have no idea.
I remember wishbone MASF123 :)

Lol. A rainbow comes out of the Unicorn I have. :D
Kids of yesterday,Zombies of Now 0_o

just like how they show the kids, then kill them to show their brains, Sumica
13the left hemisphere is a little more forward, and the right a little more back i think
Baby Cakes
break... for science
challenge accepted
That's been proven not true either.
And butterflys. OMG I think this is an MLP reference, Rockstar games called it first before it happened.
13you can also damage your brain cells by watching justin bieber
shut up kid!
lol
They don't *always* grow back, and even when they do it's really slow, but they can grow back.
lol
or crashing your car. or getting shot.
Sumica, are you implying that they killed one of the kids?
oh boy
13well i know there's the cases of someone having to have a full hemisphere removed and the other takes over just fine
or by huffing paint, Amerca's pasttime :D
or watching Jersey Shore,thank Celestia THATS cancelled lol
00,10gonna need a nother timmy

What if... we are living in Equestria all along and it is just our brain misinforming us?
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
My Mind has been messed with
Shizu, but it's a result of the brain doing stuff to let us be right 99% of the time (or at least the times that would kill us to be wrong about)
Bye bye every pony i have to go

Wirisme: Of what?

13the wannabe hiphop stuff from the early 90s is just painful
she's no twilight sparkle
13but remember
13it could be worse
13if they did this show these days, they'd have to parody bieber
it's like that LHC song
I think its just her mouth.
13no amount of science could fix bieber
no
Hello fellow mlp fans.

13it wasn't *bad* it was just bad
Take a look at this game, I fell in love with it
13but i don't have the original to compare against, just dxhr
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92985806&searchtext=Routine
The most common thing to say about it is "It's just bad in comparison".
13rather i have dx but haven't played it yet
I actually played it.
It was... actually okay.
But just okay.
Like take all the good things out of HR and the cover system and you get IW.

Herostar: Im such a retro nerd that I had to click on it
weren't we all?
Klumzeedragon: huzzah! your reward is to get another beer :D
I will! :P This one is an IPA.
i had to stop after the second episode because i litterally got serious depression from that... (i have super sensetive hearing. thought kids heard well, this made me say ouch X_X)
Herostar: yeah I bet because you have to hear it more than once making that video :o
i mean had
oni_link thing that realy horrified me? my software for reviewing it was MESSING UP. i reviewed another audio file and it worked fine. i had to RE INSTALL it to work for lavender.wav
i shat one fort that day
Herostar: o,o that damn pattern in the waves... ive seen it but never heard it

Jmo: Yeah, but I have a bad habbit of buying LOTS of games. I can't just buy one...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bpBDtGi52M&feature=relmfu
Gold_Demona: it's 2$ paired with another game from the same team :D
Phase4: dont u like me
Pfft, that's no excuse Gold_Demona
>.>
Jmo: I'm at a point financially right now where I have to be really careful what I spend my money on.
I'm avoiding the Steam shop for that reason.
Understandable then Gold_Demona :)
And for once a innocent wallet survives the horrors of the Steam sales...
an(
an*
Gold_Demona: fair enough then
>steam
>walet with money left
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQigtvLTrcc
this doesnt add up
^ :D
Yeah, we just bought a car, so we're not sure what the bill is gonna do to us. Until we get settled into the payments, I'm abstaining from making any unnecessary purchases. =/
Completely fair.
Dosh
Gold_Demona: Agreed with Jmo
Phase4: is it normal that you dont have your coulorded text like you usaly do?
is it normal that i normal
ok
I rarely buy games on Steam due to the fact I have too many ;~;
lol
Steam sales are my bane. :P
Indeed.
I bought the entire Assassin's Creed series and Skyrim during the summer sale.
Eh Assassin's Creed
Haven't played any of them yet. XP
Still yet to get into that series properly
I hear it's good, which is why I bought it.
what is this game?
I've played the first one, it is decent. But I gotta be in the mood >.<
welcome back TheRandomkid321 :P
I am SO gonna try the 3L milk challenge.
Gold_Demona: The second game is set in a place I kinda know :$
Dat holy voice...
TheRandomkid321: Welcome back man. :D

I wasn't there? D:
Moopy Don't mention eddsworld :'(

Holy shit stuff

MOther goddang 3

/me is going to have lunch
I love you too TheRandomkid321 :$
I know the legendary end to this game but I won't tell.
05lunch sounds good
05i got more pie
I love pixelated graphics.

Hello Wrek.

Wrek is now Soarin'.
Wrek: mmm pie! What flavour?
PIE flavor
05meat n potato
TheRandomkid321: So what happened in that dream of yours?
and now we are Chuck Norris
Ohai Wrek
Oh random kid, you're here. So what happened at school?
Ah, salty pie! :)
I have a 3L bottle of milk with green food dye in it. Tomorrow I shall resemble a Left 4 Dead 2 Spitter.
Mmm, meat and potatoes. Sounds awesome. =D
Wrek: I could go for something like that. :D
Klumzeedragon... I... Don't remember exactly. But geez I think it was messed up...
that doorknob
TheRandomkid321, I think you mean Boomer.
Ninjazz I mean with all green goop down my shirt.
/me is going to have lunch if he finds anithing in the firdge
Oh... that makes...sense.
Well I guess both a Boomer and spitter but considering my weight I would say Spitter.
Hey that wasn't your present you b@rstard!
TheRandomkid321: How do you know? It had no tag. :P
Becasue everyone always gives out free things in real life!
http://denver.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw2825_large.png i love you DIS much sweetie belle
Hey klumzseedragon
I've gotten free things before. :O Mister Derpy_Hooves gifted me a lovely amount of MS Points even though I had never talked to him before so we could share adventures on xBox.
I'm going to get BF3 premium yay.
Moopy: Yo? :)
flutterchu My love for sweetiebell goes from A to Z.
/me is having lunch in front of the computer
hey i'll talk to you later ok im of to bed aight
goodnight everypony im off to bed talk to yall later ok
Ahh EA... How you killed the Battlefield experience for me...
Moopy: Alright man. I'll see ya tomorrow. I'll invite you to some Minecraft if I see you on. :) Night man.
TheRandomkid321: my love for sweetie belle spells her name right
Night Moopy
flutterchu I ahet Sweetie belle. Look how far apart A and Z is on the keyboard.
sebastian is a cool name
*hate
TheRandomkid321: i love sweetie belle that i have the hole keyboard WITH a japanese keyboard
all those 4th wall breakings
TheRandomkid321: I have BF3 premium. :P I hate it so much. But it's the only way to get weapons that kill something.
flutterchu ... doesnt a japenese keyboard have fewer keys?
seatsea: Whatcha eating man?
TheRandomkid321: yes
Klumzeedragon, EA in a nutshell...
seatsea: And sorry I don't have skype.
TheRandomkid321: i love sweetie belle so much i anonymouse all the tublr's (even sweetie poo)
yep a $100 for an $80 doller game. And it is just about needed in order to get half good weapons.
But I agree AdamTheDuck. That's why I prefer my Call of Duty Elite, even though I now hate MW3, but I like how it didn't give me an edge over everpony else. :/
lol
:D SO MANY ZOMBIES IN DUNWICH
Klumzeedragon, Jesus I know right, even I like CoD more than EA now... EA just killed so many good things...
But OH! TheRandomkid321 do you own BF3 already?
Cause if not just wait 5 more days and they're coming out with BF3 Premium Edition.
Klumzeedragon i bought mine by retail yeah
Not premium
klrpwny73 pls
Klumzeedragon: i never have plain pasta if there is no sauce like chese or something i put letchup
You have to go by the rhythm
What's yam anyway?
have we seen the bat yet?
killerpony7733: Ah. :P Cause if you didnt have it, BF3 Premium Edition is coming out. Which is the game and premuim for like $70 or $80.
CrimsonPhoenix: This isn't a live stream. :)
SHIT
Klumzeedragon... F$&%
Klumzeedragon meh too much of a waste your better off buying premium for your BF3 account
05back with pie

Wrek: More shepards pie to share?

http://theoatmeal.com/comics/beer BEER
AdamTheDuck: paragon Pinkie? :D
^ educational facts about beer
/me is now having creme caramel which he has forgot the english name
killerpony7733: I agree, but I mean if you didn't have the game, it would be less expensive to do it with the Bf3 Premium edition. But if you already own it, then yeah, just buy the premium. :D
Klumzeedragon indeed.
11,02Night all ^-^

a new ocativas's secret has been uploaded by sim gretina
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tCgxhsz8tM 'Cause I feel like a relaxing song is needed for me to calm down... :S
AdamTheDuck: And I agree... The only time that DLC was good, was like the first year of the new gens. Now everyone has taken advantage and is like, "Hurp Derp, you can buy costumes and other asthetic things for your game for all the money~"
Flutterchu Yes but still... anyway I gotta go.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-7Juqpgl1o&feature=related

But I agree Wrek. Rock it For Me was the first song I heard by Caravan and I fell in love. :D It was the first time I had heard anything like it.
*:D
flutterchu: That brodyquest. :D
Phase4, you'll be surprised as I know a few bands that do that.
05mine was clash
AdamTheDuck, it is heading that way
05found it funny that the origin of the band was music for deaf peopels porn
and that makes me feel :3
I love the animation for Rock It For Me.
Wut.
Also, Clash was my first as well.
What am I watching http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/9/9/5/143995.jpg?v=1
Then Catgroove.
05its a veery unique and fantastic style of music
^
^^ But that was some history I didn't know. Good for them for making something of it. :D
Jmo: Yeah, the animation is amazing.
does no one want anything to do with my first fanfic?:(
Tis indeed.
What's it about DoctoDoctorWho?
05DoctoDoctorWho: im not much of a fanfic guy, if i was im sure id proof it for you though
Jmo: Im trying to de-jerkify blueblood
Wrek: and thanks
That'd be an interesting read.
DoctoDoctorWho: :D That seems like a tough task. But I always think of Blueblood as Dinkleberg thanks to WoonaStuck.
as far as its going so far, I think Its going to be really good, Ill keep you guys posted!
well im leaving i think i will go record a video
And redundant grammar is redundant
Bye seatsea
bye

DoctoDoctorWho: sup?
DoctoDoctorWho, Don't ever say that! Grammar is never redundant!

/me sits around burning tumbleweed
also im waiting for me to have to leave so i can listen to triage at dawn again
So, does the stream ever go back to Mother 3? Or is it just nothing but pony videos to celebrate when they reached their goal?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivj744i4HoA i love dis source
you're also aware that you're not supposed to post videolinks during streams?
It's kind of an afk stream.
Pre recorded stream

Dark_Horst: this is a stream i thought it was a recycled mother 3 playthough
not anymotr

Dark_Horst: it's on dont worry
/me still gets prerecorded stream after refresh

hello
hello everypony
Hello flutteryay
hi flutteryay
YAY, boss battle with Nyarlathotep! :D
heyheyhey
right now we have music from youtube via livestream
It is a recycled Mother 3 stream. But the stream is at the point where they reached their donation goal. So the guy just streamed pony videos. It's more of a recycled stream of pony videos.
and hi everypony
Hello flutteryay!
Hello thelonepony
And hello thelonepony
hi everpony i can only stay on for a little bit i have to go to school soon ughhhh
Ello there everybrony.

Ponies47, Slurrymoon. But this was back during a fundraiser they did a long time before I joined.
Kandarihu: Oh yeah I remeber thad Bronyfunds
*that
my brother doesnt play terrerria anymore because it's not gonna get updated anymore
What is this Terraria about?
Malavolent, it's kind of a 2D Minecraft
Sounds interesting.
Malavolent, Looks like 2D Minecraft just with less emphasis on building and more onto exploring and getting loot
And it is multiplayer as well, I suppose?
Two very different games might I add
Eeyup
Think a mixture of Castlevania, metroid and a bit of minecraft.
Also, hey Malavolent.
Ninjazz: oh yeah a BIT!!!!!
Heya, Ninjazz.
Dat Ninjazz
And yes, Malavolent, it has MP.
Dat Ponies47.
00,03Inception much?
hi Ninjazz
Hello Scoot-Scootaloo
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
flutterchu, well, probably a chunk.
/me licks Scoot-Scootaloo
Hey, thelonepony.
ill be right back im gonna go play minecraft
00,03I assume this is phase streamin'?
Scoot-Scootaloo, Bwaaaaaang.
00,03and mornin' y'all!
Mornin', Scoots.
Who is streaming?
I want to hug him for that Octavia wall.
00,03^We demand to know who is streaming!
Scoot-Scootaloo, nope, it's not Phase/
Scoot-Scootaloo, take a guess :P
Scoot-Scootaloo, it's an archived stream from Slurrymoon.
Kandarihu, aww you ruined the fun
00,03That sneaky bugger~
Oh. You guys are still watching the default Livestream feed?
This Terraria, is it free?
Malavolent, nope, it's on Steam
Malavolent, no, but it's VERY cheap. It usually goes into sale often too.
You know I have this game and haven't even installed it yet :$
Only $10 I think and $2.50 when on sale.
Malavolent, Terraria goes on discount from time to time. That's another way it differs from Minecraft
Malavolent, I recommend it. It's alot of fun. Especially with a buddy or 2.
Ok, I'll give it a try some time.
People keep telling me to get Minecraft :<
/me Killed the chat
00,03Laserpon3 is mlg~
Hello Scoot-Scootaloo! :D

Good morning DocSane
So anyway, is anyone playing games in these days? :D

my way of tricking myself into thinking i'm accomplishing something
Yay false accomplishment!
meh, it feels good still
Yes it does
Ohai :)
ohai MaxTheBrony
the chat is pretty much ded at this time :)?
Who is streaming?
yeah this is the slowest I've seen it
I'm crocheting at the moment, so I'm less responsive than usual
Whatchu making Gold_Demona o.o
A sweater. :3
For my uncle.
Anytype of pattern?
Fisherman's Crocheted Pullover, to be specific
Fair enough
What is this game?
Filled with so many wonders?
Earthbound
What is it about?
Muffins. Tis about muffins.
:>
Alien invasion
And muffins
:P
Oh, muffins and aliens.
Alien muffin invasion.
Win.
alien invasion of muffins
Alien muffins or muffin alien invasion?
Which ever makes your boat float.
Will I get drowned in alien space-muffins, or get killed by muffin-shaped aliens?
Ask Gold_Demona, she contributed to this.
I'm lazy X.X
lol, Um... I think I like the alien space-muffins
Alright.
Do they taste cool?
They taste alien. =P
Makes sense.
Phase4:
We're genius ;~;
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
!orly
wait first episode is out?
or?
:D RAYMAN
:D
MaxTheBrony: Nope, typing !cd males Tom all giddy
*makes
I need to play rayman 1 now
If only I had it
Regrettably, I've never played any Rayman game.
First game was awesome and I played a little bit of 2 a couple years ago
I shoudl get back to that
I preferred 2D though
GAH 3D CAN'T KEEP UP
Hey
And I stopped playing sonic before it went 3D
SONIC GENERATIONS
I still play the early games though
:d
occasionally
Mario is just about 20% cooler
:)
I was a sonic kid and even I agree with that
But they both had their moments
Most of the newer Sonic games are pretty bad, but I really liked Generations
Troy:sonics faster and hes a bit similar to rainbow dash but cant fly
hes RD's hedgehog cousin? :P
sonicandmario85 He can when he's Super Sonic. :P
Super Sonic can fly
SS completely broke sonic 2
literally, it froze my game once
Troy:well they sorta both have the same speed exept RD gets the speed by flying
I remember the first time I got Super Sonic in Sonic 2. I was used to Sonic 1 at the time and never got Super Sonic before. It was freaking awesome
It makes wing fortress hard as hell lol
i have sonic 2 on an emulator
The Super mechanic was a lot better in Sonic 3 & Knuckles
XD
I saw someone do a no damage run of Metropolis zone a while back. mind was blown
Still the best Sonic game imo, Sonic 3 & Knuckles
They fixed the transformation anyway
with the double jump
Amy:COME BACK HERE SONIC!! Sonic:AHH
XD
I can't stand Amy... >_>
Time to play sonic CD methinks
One-sided fangirl relationships drive me nuts.
Aww poor widdle Gold_Demona :P
yes ive watched sonic X too
Sonic X? Who's talking about Sonic X? Amy's ALWAYS like that.
/me nomths Vivix
sonic x is a show on 4kids it comes on saturdays on dont watch it on there anymore i watch it n hulu XD
on*
hmmm sonic 2 GG or sonic cd...
btw game gear sonic 2 is hard as hell
SONIC CD
/me fondles Jmo
lol
Is Steam down for anyone else ;~;
Jmo:no
:D
Yep
steam friends is down for me too Jmo
Huzzah for Steam quality.
hehe
Probably maintenance or something regarding community update-
refresh stream and it will come back
I just logged on steam
oh i thought you meant the stream XD
Ah well
oh hehe
ah I wish I had the JP soundtrack
WHAT SOURCERY IS THIS
wait is this sonic robo blast 2?
And now, Nights!
Oh, Nights
SONIC ROBO BLAST 2 IS SIMILAR TO THIS well it has some of the same sound effects
This game looks insane o.o
exept your walking in sonic robo blast 2 inside of zones
Jmo, entire community is down, so i guess there's an update
Fair enough
has anyone played sonic robo blast 2? its a fan made 3d sonic game thats epic and its multiplayer :3
can't say I have
I've never heard of it
Is this Nights into Dreams?
sure looks like it
XylemTube Yep
cool
BO
Gold_Demona:go to srb2.org to download it
Gold_Demona:then when the installer opens up select the place you wanna extract the game to
Huzzah, it returns~
well call of duty doesnt look that bad just a regular first person shooter on steam
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8amtq5aXRL8

sonicandmario85: Shut up you.

HaloCherry:why dont you read the rules? :)
Didn't they say it was okay because it's prerecorded?

Barbetos|AtWork i believe so
how exactly does an fps work on wii?
Alchemist i suppose that's true. I'm probably sometime during this year or the start of the next gonna visit my boyfriend
WARIO SHAKE IT <3
Alchemist it doesn't simple as that
sonicandmario85: I know them, don't have to.
killerpony7733: so, you at least have a very special somepony. That's more than nothing :)
HaloCherry so since you know the mods you are a exception so you can post video links during a stream?
killerpony7733: no, this stream is recorded, anyone can post videos
MadSurge i know silly.
killerpony7733: Really,?? You're coming into this? Nobody's an exception you silly.
HaloCherry hey just pointing out how you worded it.
Also it was sarcastic
I very much know the rules has no exceptions
:P
NEVER use sarcasm on the internet. Its a basic rule.
Same
I never use it in real life either, so--
I use it for a good laugh here and there yes
Sarcasm is my native language
I just suck at it

killerpony7733: Just to troll and try to get away with it.
Lil_B: Hi! :)

/me hugs Jmo and AJIsAwesome ;)
Lil_B: no, it's a recording

Lil_B: and it's SlurryMoon
MadSurge: I've never heard SlurryMoon's voice OR see him play. That's awesome. :O
Or that's how I understand it, at least
Anyway, Wreky is setting up to stream
05goan need a few more minutes
05silyl sound drivers messignw ith me again
...sry but I accedently closed the site ... the last thing I saw was MadSurges "No, it's a recording" ... and I heard a ping before I closed but I couldn't read it
Lil_B: SlurryMoon was playing in the recording. And Wrek is setting up for a stream
MadSurge ah, thanks :) when did Slurrymoon play Mother 3?
is my chat dead?
Lil_B: Nope.
nope

Good afternoon, how is everyone :)
THis will sell for a lot on the internet
/me noms on kirzstryfe plot
MLP_Brovakiin: HI! :)
finally, A Online SHop in Europe prints official MLP Shirts for Bronies and they looks... it's not my taste to say the elast :/
hia kirzstryfe and MLP_Brovakiin :)
Lil_B: PM the link?
05Lil_B: link?
05maybe i can design a pritn for them if they allow it
I search the EQD Article
Okay.
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/truffleshuffle-european-officially.html
05thakns
the pic only shows 8 shirts but there are more on the link in the article
half their MLP Shirts look like G1, honestly I don't even want to be disrespectful here
05lets give them time
05to expand their proper shirt pool
05but right now im not too willing to buy from them
Lil_B: oh noes! Only G1!
right now It would be cheaper for me to ether import in Bulk from WeLoveFine or get a High-Rez Pic and walk to the next Print-Shop, but I hope they will get some newer designs
MadSurge not only, and the actuall G4 Stuff looks kinda bland... and the colors on all the Shirts look so washed out
man they are so retro... freaking She-Ra Shirts XD
i just thought, before i went to church, to tell you people about some awesome fan made songs :)
discord by the living tombstone and Avalanche by derpycrash and marblmuzik :)
ok, I give the Site Credit, the way they have this retro Style is actually really awesome :)
wow... I have never heard abut this Discord song before >_>
05ILUASGHFIUWEFHE
05sorry for delayign
well, if you know about it, good for you, maybe someone else havent heard of it
you know, you never know you know
yeah, sorry :/
no problemo
Sup
hia SpadeMagnes[School]
SpadeMagnes[School]: hello!
brb need to restart
Sadly this computer is being a wonky piece of shit so I cant see the stream but I can talk to you guys
well i dont think youre missing anything inportant :P
SpadeMagnes[School]: Hi! :)
Chat's pretty slow today. :D
AJIsAwesome: chats very slow today
Geh
meh
Stupid random disconnect.
Heh
Wait, did we stop rhyming?
Hello SpadeMagnes[School]
I dont mind rhyming but I sort of found the constant rhyming on EQD to be annoying a bit
05ugh
05im gona need a while logner
05in fact
05ill tell you once the stream is up
SpadeMagnes[School]: I was just joking around a bit. :D
Its fine..
God my DS is old...
SpadeMagnes[School]: I heard about th Zecora challenge. I'm not good at rhyming when it comes so speaking. :D
*to speaking*
When did the Ds launch anyway?
SpadeMagnes[School]: 2006?
Hold on a second.
I think I had mine since launch
Nintendo 21, 2004.
Its falling apart, the mechanism that keeps the screen from moving and locked is broken
*November*
Dang it. :|
pieces of the hull is missing
maybe I should start focusing on actally finishing my songs -.- ... I have between 7 Songs WIP :/
To be honest, I would've liked to have the original DS instead of the lite.
SpadeMagnes[School]: mine is in prime condition, im giving it to my nephew :)
I swear my 3DS was made poorly
Lil_B: you make songs? have you made names for them yet?
I havent done anything to scratch it and theres a line on the screen that wont go away
Old one was MUCH more durable and could take a couple of falls. I dropped my DS lite one time and it broke in half. :|
AJIsAwesome: i have both my gameboy and ds
mentallyeffedguy I have Working titles for them, I usually decide the final name once they are done
bloop
Derpy_at_work: Bloop.
At least my Gameboy Sp works fine :D
08,01i keep dropping my phone this weekend
08,01still intact
I love the Bass in the Song "F-F-F-Fire!" ... I generally love all songs in Mother 3 XD
So why did this not make it to outside Japan again?
SpadeMagnes[School]: Earthbound didn't sell well in other countries.
I hate sales dictate shit like that
SpadeMagnes[School] Nintendo thought it wouldn't sell well like the previous game
You never know till you try damn it
SpadeMagnes[School]: Considering the fact that RPGs didn't sell well in other countries like USA.
Um.. Final Fantasy?
even that, thats why only 3 of the 6 FFs until FF7 were released in the US
SpadeMagnes[School]: They were almost close to releasing the first Mother game, but they scrapped it. :|
they had everything ready, but it was too late in the NESs life
Well thats fair
Hey guys, I just puted my first paint spray on TF2.
I mean if its when the console is close to ending fair enough
VenHur: Hi! :)
SpadeMagnes[School]: I really wish Earthbound sold more. I found a playable copy in a library store, but they said it wasn't for sale. :|
Hello VenHur
I played alot of Xenosaga last night
AJIsAwesome: Then what good is it?
but what I think was a douche move: the Eartzhbound Fans made a Gameboy compatible version of Mother 1 , they only released one Copy, there were no backups or anything, they send the Cartridge to Nintendo to shopw that a) there are Fans and b) that it's possible to Still release it... no answer whatsoever
wrek has a funny woman voice :P
SpadeMagnes[School]: So they put it up on display and be dicks about it. :|
mentallyeffedguy it's Slurrymoon XD
Oh hey, the show's starting.
*So they can*
05ok hit refresh!
Seriously, ALL of the other games in the library were available for purchase, and the one game you deliberately DISPLAYED isn't for sale?! :|
AJIsAwesome: trollolololol library :D
What dicks
My Ps2 makes alot of noise when it loads stuff
05gusie
05hit refresh
SpadeMagnes[School]: mine 2..
I see 17:32 :D
And heat METALLLLLLL
Chat, y u derp on me?
That's the time in Sweden, right?
*hear
FFFF my computer here says I need upgrade... wat
I guess it is
I have a PS3 Slim, and what I heard, it's less quieter then the original model.
05aye Kandarihu
Kandarihu: it's our timezone, yes
The fan inside the PS2 is loud for mine
I have to turn the sound up to drown it out
Weren't the early copies of the PS3 backwards compatible?
Was that you, Wrek?
AJIsAwesome: yesh :D
I never heard your voice before. Sounds awesome. :O
Sadly I cant hear you because I dont want to get caught :(
SpadeMagnes[School]: earplugs!!!
I'm still deciding if the WiiU is more worth it than the 3DS XL
i always facebook at school
morning everypony
Hello BladedWings
It's 5:37? Where I lived is 10:37 in the morning...
SpadeMagnes[School]: Wait a few years for the price to drop down for the Wii U.

I have all the stars on my Megaman Starforce 2 Saurian file
Wrek you gain 1+ to respect for singing linkin park
SpadeMagnes[School]: I only need the Mega star to get everything else.
Craaawling in my veeent, I don't knooow the rest of the lyriiics!
Getting the V2 cards are a bitch
SpadeMagnes[School]: To be honest, the V2 chips are the hardest to get. LD
SpadeMagnes[School]: You agree?
hi
VenHur shame on you. listen to more linkin park :D
VenHur: it's better that way :D
You have to do just badly enough to avoid V3 and good enough to avoid V1
Ohai puffmuffins!
puffmuffins: Hi! :)
It getts annoying..fast
SpadeMagnes[School]: I KNOW. They drive me crazy geting them.
hi puffmuffins
Wrek i take it you have listened to linkin park before then?
Oh my god, it's a dead guy...
LET'S POKE HIM WITH A STICK!
Zap

SpadeMagnes[School]: I love getting 999% noise and completing obliterating them. :D
Duuuh? The door opened by itself?
From what I heard theres a Meteor server only available in Japan
MadSurge: Magic, my friend. Magic. :P
SpadeMagnes[School]: Seriously? Hmm....
The thing required to acess it is region locked
VenHur: Oh that's convinc-*zapped* :D
Punch the wall like a badass.
+1 Chuck Norris point
I love playing SF2 with the most over powered card code ever
SpadeMagnes[School]: That's the Tribe King code, right?
Yup
Wrek True i know. I'm a LP fan so i know most songs by tone and i was at a concert with em two years ago
SpadeMagnes[School]: I used it for a while, but I felt like I was cheating. :D
Code is 11...erh, 1!
Who is this playing Deus Ex?
Wrek
Wrek Well at first i liked about the same then i began to like more as i tried listening.
Aw, g'day sir!
tSparx: Good day! :)
Welp
Ah*
Hello tSparx
Wrek, third time's the charm, it seems.
l33t
I feel like the Pokemon Website lied to me...
How so?
+1 point for Wrek singing "In The Hall of The Mountain King".
They said there would be a thing with Mew on the site the 6th.. its not there
SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe it's just hidden away.
dat invisible ad
They said it would be on the homepage
SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe it's just hidden away.
(／・ω・)／ Anyone there?
I'm dead.

VenHur: Welcome back! :)
Jensen swag
Adam Jensens day off
Jensens got SWAG.
This reminds me of that video "Adam Jensen needs a new mirror"
how could you want a new me? =(
is the old me not good enough?
I CAN CHANGE!
Adam punched his mirror in the game btw.
MirrorImage: You're not the mirror, you're what's in it :$
/me hugs MirrorImage "i like you the way you are :) "
must.. bob. head..
and by extension, i am it
/me bobs head "cant resist
MirrorImage: Which I guess means that you're the family's daughter! /Dr.WhoReference
And now when Adam comes around you hide.
MirrorImage: Nope, doesn't work that way. It's like saying that the monitor and what's being displayed on my monitor are the same thing.
/me bobs head.
Don't want to get an augmented punch again.
tSparx - seeing as you can't have the Monitor's image without the Monitor itself
MirrorImage: But that doesn't make them the same thing. You can't have the heat of a fire without the flame itself, but those two aren't the same thing either.
but they are still part of the greater whole typically referred to as "flame"
00,10morning all
mornin' Sumi
Mornin'
Sumica: Morning! :)
we gettin' all philosophical up in here
God, my head hurts after all that bobbing...
morning Sumica
Goodmorning Sumica
Sup Sumica :)
Fine greetings, Sumica.
00,10oh no it's deus ex, that meens i cant watch
spoilers?
MirrorImage: But it still stands that the physical mirror and its reflection aren't the same. I can take another mirror and put it in the same spot to get the same reflection/image, but it's a different mirror.
Sumica: Man up, it's actually a good game and this song's catchy as hell.
00,10aye
but it's still "a" mirror
00,10I know it's a good game but I am still playing it
tSparx - this is just getting silly now.
like i said, Jenson SWAG
MirrorImage: Nah it's not :) if you're annoyed we'll stop, but I *love* philosophical debates!
Sumica: Oh yeah...spoilers...sorry, carry on.
Jenson, the man that's party like the 90s.
00,10I shall read the new chapter of through the eyes of another instead
Sumica - "new" chapter? I thought they were just revised chapters
00,10he revises so much they might as well be new
what?
>implying the chat thinks
I've no idea what you're asking about Wrek.
same, i blanked out for a sec
MirrorImage: I think.....:(
Wrek: I'm sure whatever you do will be good, but I like commentary on the "less serious" side of the spectrum :P
He take forever to revise those chapters. but I suppose he is busy writing a script for the cartoon that is being made.
lol
lawl
Not yet Wrek
But soon./
Lawl
Barbetos|AtWork: Oi, das spoilerz!
What?
I have not played this game before.
She dies!?
D=
Barbetos|AtWork: Oh, idk.
Barbetos|AtWork: When you said "but soon," I figured someone died.
Oh. I was kidding.
Barbetos|AtWork: Never played this either :P
Ooh, what to saa-ay.
But it looks like she is royally fucked, what with all that firepower he is dealing with.
HEADSHOT
Doing this part non lethal would suck I bet.
"Ooh whatcha say, oh that you only meant well? well of course you did -- ooh whatcha say, that it's all for the best? of course it is -- ooh whatcha say ooh that it's just a-what we need? you decided this -- ooh whatcha say, ooh what did she say?"
Kill the heavy machine gunners first wrek
It will buy you time I bet.
luff dat song
I like it, not the rapped over version though
So you can save her?
Kill the guy with the sandvich first, Wrek.
what did the five fingers say to the face?
Vivix: Oh, definitely not the rapped version. I hate that one.
Hi, everypony
hi Pinkie6414
Grenades?
Pinkie6414: Hi!:)
Wrek - grenades?
Hey Jmo
o.O
Haidar
Sup Jmo?
Nothing much.
bot!
oh shit!
Wrek is such a badass!
yaay she lives!
Do you HAVE to save her?
:D
She lives? SHE LIIIVES!
It's ALIIIVE!
Okay, thanks Wrek . :)
I am sure you could save her with non lethal.
but it would be hard
Barbetos|AtWork - before or after she became Swiss Cheese?
A combo of stun nades, gas nades, and non lethal take downs could work too
I'm baaack
Sonny: Hi! :)
hi Sonny

wb Sonny :)
Hi Sonny.
Hello Sonny
Hey AJisAwesome, Applejack2012, tSparx, Venhur and MLP_Brovakiin :D
I'm making my homework atm
I have a test tomorrow
and some math
I'm guessing Wrek's hungry.
for a sandvich?
Sonny: Goodluck :D
geuss so
Oh don't worry, I had a 99% in math last exam
but I did my year over, but still
as for dutch, well let's say about 75%
Welcome back, Wrek.
Well the security on this school computer is smarter than the last one...
Tried to play games on this... all games sites are now blocked
Delicious nectar of the gods, BEER!!
Cut in line
At least Bronystate isnt blocked
and NO ONE bats an eye
Its a normal thing
in augmentation world!
And this is why you don't FUCK with [forget the guy's name] when he's cutting a line!
Oh my god JC a bomb
I like it!
That has a place almost identical.
Adam Jensen "Fuck off Darrow."
I love how we're disregarding what we're supposed to be doing and watching Bronystate instead..
Life is good
Well I personally am not supposed to be doing anything else :)
i have work in a few minutes, and i haven't decided to try opening an IRC client while on the clock
SpadeMagnes[School]: I'm supposed to be finishing my homework....:D
AJIsAwesome: I just assume that every moment you're on BronyState you're supposed to be doing some homework :P
Wrek: Y U NO sell stuff?
Fuck Homework...
tSparx: I'm getting my work done early so I have more time get ready for Brony Fun Fair. :P
+1 point for Wrek pulling a Simpsons refference.
*to get ready*
AJIsAwesome: Brony fun fair? :O
20 more days till I can get MoP
MLP_Brovakiin: Did you not know about it?
AJIsAwesome: Elaborate please
AJIsAwesome: No? nobody tells be nothing :P
he is Sinistar!
did the chat derp on me or was no one talking?
(／・ω・)／ Dimmp
tSparx: I'm leaving for BFF on Saturday and I have homework that's due over the weekend. I'm getting it done now so I don't have to worry about it.
Wirisme: Since when?
*Dunno
A few minutes
i think noone was talkin
AJIsAwesome: No I mean is the BFF a con?
tSparx: Yes.
MoP is gonna be so awesome!
Wirisme: Yeah, we've been talking for the last few minutes.
AJIsAwesome: Where abouts is it?
MLP_Brovakiin: It's in Austin, Texas. To be honest, I had to search for brony conventions since no one tells me about them. :D
AJIsAwesome: oh ok :(
MLP_Brovakiin: I actually signed up on a webiste for Brony meetups.
If only I knew about the fun fair PMV contest before
MLP_Brovakiin: THat should help you. They told me about Brony Fun FAir.
AJIsAwesome: Oh I heard about that one. Sadly, Austin is too far away from St. Louis for me to make the journey just yet.
AJIsAwesome: what is it called? :)
Man I love WoW
MLP_Brovakiin: I'll link you it.
AJIsAwesome: Ok thank you :)
way far away from Denmarlk

Sup alexxm?
I wish I could play WoW on this...

alexxm: I'm fine.

Im gonna go stir crazy waiting for MoP
Bonjour alexxm :)
Hello alexxm
Bonouir
I still don't know how to play Marco Polo :D
Bonjour
MadSurge: It's simple
how are things tSparx and MLP_Brovakiin
Whats with the rediculace shades
MadSurge: Many people in a pool, one guy is "it," he closes his eyes and tries to tag someone else.
leeeeerrrooooy jeeeenkkkiinnnns
alexxm: Good thanks, how about you?
Adam Jensen doesn't give a fuck with the shades, he thinks they're badass.
MadSurge: Everytime he calls out "marco," the rest of the players have to reply by calling out "polo."
God I fucking hate Canary Mary
MadSurge: And that's how the guy who's "it" finds his victims :P
Doing good here too
MLP_Brovakiin well i'm back at college and i found out they had us come back on a day before everyone has a day off for the rest of the year
/me goes lurk
I just came back from playing Slender... I got all eight pages! But, Slender caught me...
Pinkie6414: The ending was awesome, right?
I heard he gets you regardless
*in sarcastic voice*
Advice to all peoples that played Slender. 1. DON'T PLAY THE GAME IN THE DARK WITHOUT THE LIGHTS ON.
You. have. been. warned...
SpadeMagnes[School]: In the updated version he gets you, but you wake up and it's the day
So you live
VenHur: Amnesia is better
alexxm: That sucks, it was also my first day back and it turns out it was thurday so I had engineering all day...
DABI PLS
Oh, really?
When ever I play Banjo Tooie I want to slap the person who made the Cloud Coockooland Canary Mary Jiggie
JAYMOO PLS
I LOVE YOU.
MLP_Brovakiin basically i have every friday off now and they had us come back the day before our day off
<3
Oh! I haven't played this, yet. I probably should watch the stream XD
I thought Slender was a brandnew name
shouldn't actually.
Rubberband AI is never fun
alexxm: What was the point of that? some schools can be so dumb
I thought you die no matter how many pages you collect. Glad they changed the ending so that you actually work for something.
How have you not been killed by the wildlife yet jaymoo?
Slender's a fun game, I agree, but it's kind of...boring collecting all the pages.
How does slender even find you without a face?
caise
cause
Needs more taco demons in the game.
I'm a total bad-ass dabi/
SpadeMagnes[School]: Echolocation?
y'know?
SpadeMagnes[School]: Sonar
He bangs his drums
MLP_Brovakiin no idea i would have just had us come have us come back start of next week
He has ears
?
I dunno, maybe
SpadeMagnes[School]: He's *Slenderman*, that's how he finds you.
SpadeMagnes[School]: My point still stands :P
Why does Slenderman want you dead anyways? Did we piss him off?
Jmo: Do they teach you how to survive in school? :P
oooh Wrek is playing his game of the year? awesomeness, Dick Jensen runthrough?
Pfft
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Lots of New Shirts Available at Welovefine
SpadeMagnes[School]: 'Cause he's *slenderman* :P
SpadeMagnes[School]: He just wants his $20 ;_;7
SpadeMagnes[School]: I think he just wants a hug, but the sight of him makes you die. :D
School needs to learn how to survive me, not the other way around.
GIMME $20
I think we all know why's Slenderman is looking for us...he wants to give us the slab.
Geddit rite dabii
Lul
o u
us? I mean him.
/me doesn't eat MLP_Brovakiin's face
Wrek: slenderman gives the best hugs...followed by death
Curse my grammar, why it failed me today?!
Slender doesn't eat faces
Or anything in that matter.
No, that's all me.
<:
Monster.
Is there a map of Slenderman?
>implying you wouldn't love it if I ate your face
Screw Slender, I'm more scared of seeing you pop up in my room.
Ohai
You have a point.
Well I stole your face!

SpadeMagnes[School]: I forgot what my favorite noise form is. I think it's Taurus.
SpadeMagnes[School]: I LOVE SwordFighter X. So overpowered. :D
What's happening?
Lawl
Pinkie6414: Vis a vis what?
Just found out the Looney Tunes Show is getting new episodes in October.
hi
AJIsAwesome: My dad and I were expecting to hate it, but it's actually not too shabby :)
Heya ThunderStrike :)
ThunderStrike: Hi! :)
...Panic Button Time, AJIsAwesome?
hi tSparx and AJIsAwesome :)
Hello ThunderStrike
Hi, ThunderStrike! :)
tSparx: Same here. I think it's a pretty good sitcom based Looney Tunes. :)
how are things ThunderStrike
VenHur: Nope. I actually kind of like the show. :$
Well, I...don't like it...
and hi to you too MLP_Brovakiin and Pinkie6414
alexxm: allright, kind of bored. but nothing bad is up
VenHur: Well, you don't have to if you don't want to. Fine by me.
AJIsAwesome: What's most impressive is that my dad likes it too -- and he's been a Looney Toons fan since the 50's!
sounds awesome to me Wreky
Ok :)
The classic Looney Tunes ARE classic, and nothing can top it....Tiny Toons Adventures is also fine with me.
tSparx: Nice.
I'm here to inform you guys that for some freaking reason all of a sudden my laptop shut down and said somthing about ethernet thingy and IT WONT START UP
:(
And Animaniacs...and etc.
VenHur: Oh, true dat, nothing tops the classical LT
and this computer sucks so hard
VenHur: True, very true, but for a sitcom Looney Tunes it's not that bad.
VenHur all of stephen speliburgs cartoons from the 90's were some of the best cartoons of all time
Well, *except*... *maybe* the animaniacs.
Hey twilight_sprinkle :)
tSparx: You don't like the Animaniacs?
Hello twilight_sprinkle :)
Hey Dumorimasoddaa :)
hi
Dumorimasoddaa: Hi! :)
AJIsAwesome: No, I'm saying that I might like it more than classic LT :3
hey Dumorimasoddaa
tSparx: Oh. Okay. :$
It's nice to see that nobody cares, I'll be going now
twilight_sprinkle: Hi! :)
hi
Sonny: I care...:(
hai tSparx MLP_Brovakiin and AJIsAwesome :)
I loved Animaniacs
God FUCKING Bless Stephen Spielburg. Too bad we might never see another cartoon from that BRILLIANT man...
Pinkie and the Twilight
VenHur: Yeah.........:(
Sonny: I didn't see what you said, sorry to hear it :/
and Applejack 2012 hi
it's just that I'm so pissed right now, I hate when my laptop wont even start
Pinkie and Freakazoid would be best friends. :D
I'm gonna try and fix it so I'll be back later
Sonny: Is it overheating?
Applejack2012: My dream show <3
Pinkie, Pinky, and The Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, BRAIN! [narf!]
Sonny: See you later. :)
no my laptop has some kind of ethernet problem
:(
AJIsAwesome: Pinkie, DeadPool, and Freakazoid chilling out :)
Sonny: Oh. Maybe you should try again later.
Goodbye Sonny
tSparx: Best crossover ever. :D
and somthing with ethernet
I'll (hopefully) figure it out
cya
bye bye Sonny
tSparx: oh god all of my yes :D
Wrek: i love your rage
Wrek, remember what my mother used to say: it's not a game anymore if you're not having fun :3
games are serious business
bye
I love your reaction "I am slightly aggrivated" :D
Wirisme: They are also made for funz
Wirisme: And for lulz.
:D
*aggravated
Wirisme: AJIsAwesome and for the gamer community :)
;)
tSparx: That too.
Alright, I'm probably gonna stay until Wrek's done, and then take off.
I have lunch to grab :P
it's nearly time for dinner
My brother Mike wont stay at BFF for long - he's not real big into the brony fandom, :) an anime con he can do, I think I'm wearing him down :P
Which is good because I'm hungry
I have my dinner now :) brb
Wirisme: Are you a Briton?
I am
MLP_Brovakiin: Bye!:)
Wirisme: I am five hours behind you :$
Cypresswolf: Maybe he could go somewhere and have some fun.
nye
Cypresswolf: My family's going to find someplace to golf.
;brb
Cypresswolf: Or something like that. :D
I think when he sees the vast age range, he may stay a bit longer than planned :)
Cypresswolf: That would be great. :)
bye
I'm trying to coax him into doing the drinking ponies panel with me
Wrek awesome quote inc
I need someone to help keep me awake :)
/me has returned with lasagna :)
/me puts raisins in MLP_Brovakiin s lasagna
Cypresswolf: Yeah. I'm going to try and find some energy drinks. :D
oh hey, deus ex
MLP_Brovakiin: Sounds delicious. :)
Dark_Horst: Hello! :)
AJIsAwesome: hi
Bronysith: Why would you do such a thing? :(
RD energy drink :D
/me waltzes into Bronystate
hi
AJIsAwesome: It is :)
Ohai
how are things GabeMoist
Im bringing coffee with me - planned coffee breaks throughout saturday & a nap (prior to coffee of course)
Applejack2012: I'm thinking of getting some. :D
Hello GabeMoist
GabeMoist: Hi! :)
hio
hi
alexxm school is attacking mah brain
I'm considering taking naps, but I always hated them as a kid. :D
that phase?
I cant make it through the day without one, sleep late on weekends, sleep as soon as I get home from work
I can't nap for some reason it's full blown sleep or nothing
AJIsAwesome: If I take naps I can't get to sleep later on :/
on that note, staying awake from 2 am wasnt such a good idea
now i find myself wanting to play human revolution again. which is a problem, since i'm busy playing the first deus ex. for science
For some reason when I take naps, I feel like I wasted time and I'm sad for the rest of the day.
I wish I didn't have to sleep at all actually
think of the extra time!
I'm fine with sleeping but not napping.
AJIsAwesome: i know that feel
If I could go through life without sleep, that would be awesome :) I'd start by spending nights in the bar swapping stories
If I am not doing anything and I am don't want to sleep, I usually spend my day on bronystate or on xbox :P
I can't wake up after 9 AM feeling like my entire day is ruined. :D
Wirisme: I couldn't not dream
*and I
AJIsAwesome: HAHAHAAHAHA, man, there were days this summer when I went to *bed* at 9am xD
I always wake up before 9. I hate waking up after 9. :D
tSparx|Away: :D
My name was innacurate, now it's fixed :3
Wrek: I'm listening!
Wrek: I even heard you do the "walking on sewage bit" and thought it was funny the second time :)
Wrek: I am watching/listening @)
time too
Now I'm back
*
and I still see Deus Ex
I liked it too
Gahagafaga
KnifeH: Welcome back! :)
Welcome bach KnifeH
KnifeH: I think Wrek's going for just a little bit more :)
Hehe

Wait, this is my first time here.
Hmmm..
KnifeH: Welcome! :)
Then welcome!

"Now I'm back" you *trickster* :P
KnifeH: As long as you read the rules, you'll be fine here. :)
I should draw :|.. but oh well. :D
RRRAAAWWWEEEERR!!!!!!! :D

Ahh, the dragon's back!!!
KnifeH: Okay. :D

I met Wrek at BUCK
I got on early due to my school site being a piece of shit for everyone
KnifeH: Cool. Does he talk much?
And we're both Swedish, so we instantly spoke that IKEA talk.
He does, a bit.
I should harass him more about the art trade.
6Cause it wanted it before letting me see my quiz results :P
6Wb ^^
But yet again, I'm lazy myself.
So how is everyone

SpadeMagnes[R]: Just waiting for Friday to roll around.
Fine I had to quit school for a bit
Yes, electroswing! :)
Trying to figure out why my YouTube video is getting 2k views every day XD
The site crashed

As for criticism (if you wanted), I got none right now.

Hi everypony! :)
Hai Joy
Heya
It's cold out here. I should get inside.
how you doing Joy
Hello Joy
6:O
Hi Joy!
Joy: Hi! :)
Wrek, I'm still interested to know wether there is any significance to the armor inscription/embossing, or wether it's just old style art
05SafariMonkey: all the runes spell out actual words
05its thats what you're saying
Good evening
I shall go inside. If I disconnect, consider me having dropped my laptop
:O
Hey I was listening to this today in school :)
So, I just played Slender... Got five pages, then I died.
ikr lol
Joy: Are you playing the updated version?
i want some hot tea and jaw droppingly large strawberry desserts
AJIsAwesome: Yep
So many message places to keep track of!
Wrek: In english (rune style letters) or in another language? If not english, would you like to tell ud what they say? If it's english, I must just be bad at reading. :P
Joy: Okay.
*us
hey guys! wanna hear something funny?
mentallyeffedguy: Sure
mentallyeffedguy: Depends. Is is offensive?
we didint need to go to church today! i fucked up"
.. I almost dropped it.
why?
That should teach me form carrying 10 things at a time
from**
6:3
Especially if it's a sum of 2800 dollars.
I blame the beer.
nobody told me church was only 2 times in the month :(
KnifeH: The normal expression is that should/will teach me *to* X
when i grow up, im gonna be an awesome viking pony
No need to correct someone who's drunk a beer.
:)
Freaking Pokemon site...
Almost 1Pm and still no "Mew Prize Pack"
SpadeMagnes[R]: Mew prize pack?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Pokemon are dangerous when they freak...
Mew won this bracket so it was gonna have a prize pack on the six of september
Its almost 1 PM and nothing has shown up at all
Wrek.. box can be very seductive.
And no.. I'm not drawing Twi the way you think.. well.. maybe
box = bock
..
book!
What is wrong with me today.
05i dunno
05oh btw
wonder if wrek got inspired from the Arn films last night :P
05what was your art request?
05for the trade
I never gave one :p
KnifeH: Beer probably.
05and mentallyeffedguy: i drew this before the movies
But it must have Scootaloo
00,10this picture cam before he showed the films
Wrek: i know, but did it inspire you further, if you know what i mean
Erm.. I don't think it's the beer. I only had one.
KnifeH: Well if *one* beer has you typing like that...
00,10not sure but I just cant see em keeping that long of a tail wrek.
I think it's the anger, frustration, rage and sadness doing it.
lol my crush from grade 6 is here haha
A combination of epic... stupidity.
a really fun thing to do at school is point at the ground at someones feet and its gaurunteed they will look
Sumica: Scandanavians are known for having long hair.
Sumica: Yeah, that length of tail done like that would be a major liability in close combat...
6xDD
Gah
The tail is there for backup.
Whipping
00,10Not saying long is bad, but draging on the ground behind ling might be too much
Unless of course they have good tail control like AppleJack but I thought that was earth pony magic...
My computer is lagging so bad...
I should stream tonight.
Now that I think about it.
Heyo
Wait whoa
05KnifeH: good you can show me that sketch<3
ScootaChicken: Hi! :)

Wrek: You know.. books are very good for making things.. *ahem* suggestive.

Hello Sumica! :$
00,10hi MadSurge
Hi, Sumica! :)
Holla everypony! :)
Hey guys...
Hi GilDash
*hugs GilDash*
hello Sonny and Sumica
Howdy GilDash, Sonny!
GilDash: Hi! :)
Hey Sonny and GilDash :)
I just found out that my laptop randomly stopped working
Sumica, was it you who fell asleep and gave us a black screen for a while once?
We sat around pinging you or something-
And It's unfixable
00,10poasably
...
hi GilDash
We played sounboard
Sonny: So new computer?
Sonny: Maybe you should try to get your old files back.
Hello GilDash
Ye I'll need to buy one...
Oh damn KnifeH, 7/8 then caught.
00,10some times i set up a playlist and leave it running for you all when i know there wont be any one on for some time
Can't acces them
I lol'd
Jmo: I got them all
I skipped the last hour of school today hope the techers dont know...
Ah yeah
Watch the end
Yea still watching ;P
Why hello there GilDash!
Hey there, Shizuka!
hi Kandarihu|OldComp and Shizuka
MadSurge: Holla! :)
So basicly my laptop just broke with no reason at all and I need to buy a new computer now urgh...
but anyway
Since I still have a computer left I'll just go on this one
So let's do this again, hey everypony :)!
Sonny: Sorry to hear that. No computer is truly unfixable, sometimes you just hyave to replace every component, and that is more expensive than a new laptop :P What went wrong?
hi Sonny
I don't know, I started my laptop as always and went to get somthing to drink
Hello Sonny
HOLY!
I approve of drunk scootsw
scoots**
or somthing
Poor Scoots :(
Well, my mom's taking her laptop to the hospital to teach a client. This time, I taught her how to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots, and she took notes. So there might be two Kandarihus here, even though |OldComp will be me.
And now it wont start
I unlocked Daytime Mode!
Kandarihu|OldComp: Okay.
I made Wrek draw Scootaloo. Now I can sleep tonight
Sonny: Why do you say unfixable?
Because I researched it and they say my hard disc broke when that message is displayed
so yeah
LOL
Sonny: Just replace your HDD then.
https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GUWRP1nRO38/UEUGkDDIbwI/AAAAAAAAFDE/nvrY6uatW74/s1600/WizardRidingaUnicornonaRainbowinSpace.png i will not rest before everyone has seen nyan mlp
The problem is I know somthing of computer but not of hardware
I have no idea what HDD is
00,10zomg scootabuse =p
Sonny: Hard Disc Drive
drunk scootaloo?
I'll try that later but now I'm stuck with school
Dat 8/8
:)
Sonny: If it's really old, sure buy a new one if you want to and can afford to, but a broken hdd isn't the end of a computer's life if you don't want it to be.
mentallyeffedguy, I was half expecting that to be a ponification of Ranka Lee's Nyan Nyan song.
/me puts Sumica in a full nelson
I have it for about a year and a bit now my laptop
but still
Dem reactions KnifeH. Heh.
Sonny: then it's still quite new
I know right!?
Whats the worst fandom ever?
I'll just let them repair it again, but I'll stationise it now
CCCP: sonic fans
Jmo: what reactions?
So it can't break
Bronysith: :D
and once again... all my files will be gone
KnifeH: Your Slender reactions broski.
CCCP, I'd think Twilight fans.
I just started making fan art -.-
Jmo: Oh, yeah XD
Bronysith: True.
Too funny
Sonny: mine's 1 and 2/3 and I still consider it quite new
Bronysith but sonic fans are just furries
Bronysith: I'm a Sonic fan and I agree with that. :D
I got speedpaints if you want to see them
I am intrigued.
CCCP: wow, wow, that is just evil
Same channel
I'm a sonic fan to the extent that I play some of the games on occasion
CCCP: not all sonic fans are furries, they are just terrible fans
Brb digging through your channel till the end of timeee~
CCCP: I'm not a furry. Don't generalize.
Jmo: Watch the one called "Scootaloo's dream"
Bronysith what makes them so terrible?
AJIsAwesome sorry
CCCP: No problem.
Safarimonkey I just started making music
CCCP: they are fans of a dead franchise
I actually made a song
to put on youtube
In my opinion, Sonic fans complain and whine too much.
Bronysith im a fan of dead franchises too :s
just not of Sonic
I'll just get a pc
Sonny: Yeah?
brb 4 hours. Toilet
Sonny: Didn't you have a PC?
sonic games just are now shit
glhf KnifeH.
Jmo: Always
Ye it was called Confused, it was about Pinkie Pie's mental break down
Jmo: Did you find the video I mentioned?
I made a pic with it, lol
Bronysith does SSBB count as a sonic game?
Yeah I'm 2 minutes in now KnifeH
CCCP: really? fucking really?
Jmo: Sweet beans
I mean I DID, but now it just, Poof vanished
great
CCCP: wow, that is the most retarded question i have ever read
EVER
Bronysith lol
Sonny: sorry I lost my message to the up arrow
Bronysith it was a joke
CCCP: no it wasnt
Jmo: PS: It's better with music on ;3
Jmo: really sets the mood
Bronysith yeah it was
CCCP: you just realized your stupidity and tried to take it back
Basicly I made a video much alike one I saw on youtube called "thelivingtombstone" or somthing and it inspired me together with other fan art and music such as Wrek
Holy scheiss that looks adorable <3
KnifeH: Got my speakers playing the music with it, tis all geewdd.
:)
And now I can't accces it anymore since it was saved on my computer
I'm guessing I'm still watching Wrek, but art!Wrek?
Sonny: Glad to see that you're back, Sonny, you get your comp straightened out?
Bronysith you must be pretty stupid if you thought i wasnt joking
No tSparx
It broke
I lost all of my work
05hmm
Sonny: D:
ALL of it
:(
Sonny: I'm so sorry! That's *awful* :(
i know :'(
CCCP: well you didnt show any sort of emote face to say you were joking, also there are alot of false gamers out there that make these stupid questions that are dead serious
sorry
hey there wrek
But I'll get a pc now so it wont brake because of damage
or so I hope
i like using emots for serious things
anyway, is that Scootaloo?
Bronysith: CCCP I find it almost impossible to joke on the Internet without using some silly emote, 'cause otherwise no one can hear you inflection over the text :P
Sonny: the Hard Disk drive contains all the information on the computer, so all of your files and programs will be lost, unless you backed up recently. (programs can be reinstalled) However, if you get a new HDD your computer should be fine, except that. *Please* tell me you backed up recently!
I always feel super awkward using emotes, so I never do
tSparx: thank you
I like this drunk scoots
This also leads to the worrying problem that I also use :P when I'm being serious sometimes too :)
tSparx but the joke is i wanna see someones reaction, basically i was trolling. poorly
hai wrek
05hi Lyra`
I didn't hear CCCP's joke, but I've been in his shoes before, I understand how that goes :)
CCCP: those with thin skin should not troll
05so far KnifeH?
<3
Safarimonkey, ...
I didn't
that's the thing
Heya Wrek. :) Howd your meeting go?
I made it yesterday because I was so inspired
Sonny: D:
Bronysith im stupid please explain what that means?
Wrek: it looks all gewd. I like the position, most definitely :D
05jsut fine Klumzeedragon
Now my internet is slowed down because I reached limit, My laptop broke and I lost all of my work
Good to hear! And hello hello everypony else. :)
Wrek: Try and make the mouth like.. droolish.. Remember, tongue out
BUT, the good news is that I will go to my dads place sunday and he HAS a good computer :D
Sonny: Well I hope I at least spared you the expense of a complete new laptop.
thank you SafariMonkey
hi Klumzeedragon
yay this song!
Is that an adorable Berry Punch I spy? :P And hows it going CCCP?
Not sure if Scootaloo has a tail or not :p
Klumzeedragon: This is Scoot.
good song
CCCP: thin skin, easily disturbed, opposite of thick skinned which people with thick skin are not easily phased by insults
oh there we go
Klumzeedragon: Hi! :)
hi Klumzeedragon
my god my internet sucks
:p
Klumzeedragon: Scootaloo.
Hey Klumzeedragon
how you doing Klumzeedragon
hi Klumzeedragon
Everlasting_Joy: Ah. I kind of thought so, but the bottle threw me off. :D
Bronysith okies :c
/me refuses to say hi to Klumzeedragon
Wait, damnit :P
She just HAD to take a drink of that cider :D
tsparx: :o
Did I miss Doctor Who, guys?
Wow. :P How is everypony?
SafariMonkey: I don't think so, no.
Nope
Yay!
/me hugs tSparx ;) You know you want to say hiiiii.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: MLP Royal Engagement Party in London
Hi, Klumzeedragon!
Klumzeedragon: I lost all my hard work, my laptop, and my fast internet, bisides that I feel fine
SafariMonkey: It's been Wrek since 9am (GMT-5) (it's 13:40 GMT-5 now) :P
/me hugs Klumzeedragon back :)
Hello Klumzeedragon I don't know you. Would you like to remedy that problem for me?
That was amazing KnifeH.
alexxm: I'm good. :) Barely woke up. Took some trash out and cleaned out a rat trap... :S
Jmo: Glad you liked it :3
Sonny: Aw. Sorry to hear about that. Hopefully things start looking up. :)
thank you drag :)
Jmo: I had another one but it got banned by YouTube
orlynao?
dat underage drinking
Jmo: Yes. They considered it sexual. It was just a follow up speedpaint.
I'll get the link if you want
To the pic
/me shakes SafariMonkey hoof. :P Pleased to meet you!
Sure, send it my way via PM.
And then Scootaloo woke up in an alley somewhere in Canterlot. She started drinking in Ponyville.
That piece, are you serious?
/me shakes hoof of Klumzeedragon. Very nice to meet you too!
Yes
God Youtube is ridiclious.
Jmo what do you mean?
I've got a class to go to, so I must take off folks. Take care!
Jmo: I even appealed to it, linking the pic and everything
thanks
KnifeH: That really is rubbish.
Jmo: It's not youtube really, its usually because people flag it. And once something gets flagged enough it does what it did dun dooed.
Everlasting_Joy: Bye! :)
Jmo: I know.
Sonny: Specifically, Wrekys is the name he goes by on there :)
Jmo: I will reappeal
Youtube community is even worst.
I know ^^
bye Everlasting_Joy
just since my laptops broke I don't have the link
Jmo: They guy who judged is a brony hater XD. That's for sure
Huzzah for reappeal~
Fosho.
that system is absolutely retarded, it's like the spam flagging
Jmo: I could just reupload it.
KnifeH: What is the image in question?
Jmo: But it'd rather not risk my other vids to be removed
I shall link, if I may
KnifeH: That's completely understandable.
"Oooooh, something ain't right." <3
05KnifeH: btw jsut cleanign the lines up atm
Wrek: I knows :3
KnifeH: Always feel free to link to images during the stream, ask a mod for anything else :P
This was considered sexual and nudity
There, done
:p
nope not seeing it
KnifeH: I'm confused about what's going on there, but it's very well-drawn and expressive :)
KnifeH: I thought youtube admins were smarter than that.
:D Ponies are always naked?
And obviously not inappropriate :)
AJIsAwesome: Still people with opinions.
KnifeH: I think it's a fantastic piece of art.
KnifeH: True.
haha Klumzeedragon xp
yeah that's really good
hi everyone :)
That needs MUCH fantasy to see any nude/sexual content
Klumzeedragon: Bronies are the only fanbase whose characters are made more sexy by the *addition* of clothes :P
AJIsAwesome: Well, you need to watch my previous speedpaint to know what's going on, duh :D
are we talking about Art?
lol
Hello again Lil_B! :)
hi Lil_B
i dont think ponies should be considered sexy
^
Lil_B: Hows it going? :) And yeah. KnifeH drew something and linked us.
touché
/me hugs MadSurge CCCP and Klumzeedragon
I think ponies should be considered cute :p
Klumzeedragon was it well drawn?
Sonny same
Lil_B: Extrememly. :)
Klumzeedragon can you pm me the link?
mentallyeffedguy: I don't find the ponies sexy, but some peeps do, and it's a big tent :)
There you are. :)
remember naked ponies are cute and innocent dressed ponies well http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0oitfCcft1rny1evo1_500.png
lol
tSparx: Ikr? Although "sexy" is a stretch :D
haha :D
Spectrum_Rush: Roseluck is always adorable. :P
Derpy is cute...
sexy is good
CCCP: agree^
:)
KnifeH: So what is going on in your art? Scoots caught Rainbow Dash and feels bad about it? Or hurt her when she caugt her?
when I would call a Pony "sexy" i would probably mean it like "charmful and beautiful" for the sake of beeing Charmful and beautiful, like Flur-De Lis
I'm npt really into the whole sock thing IMO, but the cutest picture I've seen of socks is Pinkie with a head sock. :D
*not*
beautiful is the right word :)
i thin kmost eople call ponies sexy as a joke
Dat CM
Maybe, maybe not
well I guess every femine character on the internet will experience the wrath of rule 34
YEEEES! Ra Ra Rasputin!
KnifeH I just saw your Picture, looks amazing
CCCP: True, but there are some who don't
Klumzeedragon: Go to my YouTube and watch "Scootaloo's dream" and read the description. YouTube is KnifeH
boozaloo?
:D
DAT BOOZE CUTIEMARK :D
Scootabooze
It explains more than I could say right now
KnifeH: Alrighty. :)
Scootabooze is scootabuse ;__;
Is that a form of Scootabuse?
^
Dammit, ninja'd
Scoot's cutiemark, a booze bottle.
SirGanjalf: No. It's a play-on word of scootabuse.
Oh dear
mother of god... Vinix you're right
°-°
O_O
hehe
dramatic zoom
Well, a lot of actual "Cloppers" just remain silent about it, many people who r34 them just do it for the lulz
lol
=_(\
>.>
I hate scootabuse
Loud R34 ruin it for many people
As my dad always says, "Turn to any page on the Sears catalogue, everything on that page, there's someone out there who wants to fuck at least somethign on there." Haha, it's a *very* big tent :P
Maybe we should drop this discussion, this really isn't the place for this kind of stuff.
So I drew it.. well.. trying to make sense out of it
AJIsAwesome im arilright if some one does that but it really does seem like an unavoidable part of the fandom, i mean like i find it hard to go on some really awesome sites that every other pic is r34 and its annoying.
I'm back!
Alrighty.
CCCP: Agreed.
hi Amber
CCCP: It's really hard to find some simple innocent pics with something like that popping up.
oh boy are we bitching about cloppers?
Noones bitching, per se
As long as there no adult action I think it can be considered cute (as in love)
AJIsAwesome ikr
Sonny: it is just sex, there is nothing wrong with love and sex
I just like normal art and pics. Dont see why we gotta sexualize it :P
Bronysith more like just talking :/
Maybe we should drop the discussion before this gets out of hand........
Yeah
AAAAAANNYYYYWAAAAYYY
nice pic Wrek
:)
i wonder why was this face not exploited or used http://derpiboo.ru/76451
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates September 6th (Afternoon)
/me is uncomfortable with alcohol
I was bored XD
Brad[Laptop] really, a lot of people draw it just for the heck of it XD
dat prokofiev
yeah pretty much
Lil_B I wish I could draw half as good as many of the artists out there :P
or it's a commision
"Love and tolerance." Period :)
Spectrum_Rush: I never saw that face before. :D
Applebloom gusta
^
Lil_B it makes no sense why you would draw it for the heck of it though..
Wrek: what are you doing? I must now backhand you with my hoof for you abusing the tablet.
KnifeH: ponies dont have hands...
CCCP, why not? Many of my friends draw and write the most perverted things for the lulz. Like a female friend I had wanted to write yaoi about two overweight truckdrivers-
so therefore you cannot backhand KnifeH
KnifeH: nice speed paint! i liked it :)
Vivix: ........................
It's her humour-
AJIsAwesome: ita from hearts and hooves day, when the cmc are in the bushes watching Bic Mac and Cheerilee
Vivix: lol
mentallyeffedguy: :D
Vivix: Okay. I'm just saying this isn't the place to drop that kind of bomb here. :D
Vivix lolwut
Nono, sorry hehe
Hmmm
Urgh
shotas better than yaoi anyway.. >.>
Whoever gets it gets a free pic
MY PHLEGM IS GONE WOOT
I was My little pony was strict lecture that you need to see :p
KnifeH: ill be your 200
You sonova KnifeH.
give me a link KnifeH
Spectrum_Rush: okay.
CCCP when an artist does something, he doesn't need a reason to do it, they did it because theythought it would be a funny Idea, the really is all the reason they need
Anyone play Dota 2?
Had to be 199th. /flipstable
So I want be treated like an alien when I start a conversation about it
...
Still on 200
CCCP, o u shotatiger
Could be the youtube refresh rate of epic slowness
Lil_B yeah but the idea of sexualizing it isnt funny anymore
If someone gets it, take a screenshot and note it to me
:L
mentallyeffedguy: Yes. I got 10000 watchers in general if you count other sites XD. I just started my youtube a few months ago
KnifeH what kind of videos do you make?
CCCP for you, different people, different opinions, my opinion is that too much dubstep remixes of a song is just too much, does that stop people from continuing to make remixes of it?
nope
Sorry, had to refresh page. Might have lost some comments
and Pms
h
Wrek Volbeat?
KnifeH: how come everybrony can draw but me?
mentallyeffedguy: I can't draw either.
mentallyeffedguy I had a drawing but it was terrible
Lil_B Well i belive there are no need for guns, (im trying to change this topic to the 2nd amedment to piss people off)
mentallyeffedguy not everyone can draw i can't really for example so you aren't alone
mentallyeffedguy: I can only kind of draw? :P But I need templates and shiz to draw well.
CCCP: I call your bluff: no :P
I haven't drawn since I was a kid
CCCP whats the second amedment? (I'm no english :P )
mentallyeffedguy: I started out drawing stick figures.
You see the 2nd amendment is pointless! Guns are not inportant anymore
mentallyeffedguy: keep that as a motivation
KnifeH: hahahaha thats funny
Lil_B: The 2nd amendment of the US consituttion
Totallyagreedbutcan'tdiscussthathere
Lil_B: Right to bear arms.
Applejack2012: Can I bring it to 1000?
mentallyeffedguy: true though
tSparx wat?
KnifeH: you dont know how terrible i am
oh
Everything comes with practice
mentallyeffedguy: I'm talking about stick figures here XD
KnifeH can you send me your youtube channel adress? Wanna check you out
Vivix: True. :D
Lil_B: "The maintenance of a well-ordered militia being necessary for the defense of the union, the right to bear arms shall not be abridged." (A close paraphrase)
do it in private
Just keep at it, and try to avoid drawing what you know, and draw what you see
:)
looks like she drank to much Apple Cider
yup
ok, thanks XD
Sonny: http://www.youtube.com/user/KnifeH
True
CCCP: But they are. We need them to be able to protect our houses and such. And in some cases they have stopped armed robberies. :) In a way they're good and in a way it's bad. It's best to have an ammendment for it, rather than everypony and there grandma breaking the law by carrying anyway.
always nice to meet someone who actually has a talent :P
YouTube stat refresh rate, yay
mentallyeffedguy Ive been looking at pony drawing tutorials but have yet to attempt it, im my own greatest critic, if something looks even a little off ill get angry with myself, heh.
Lil_B: Because that's a grammatical clusterfuck, there's a lot of controversy in the US over exactly what that amendment means xD
Dat 200.
I only got one A in art in my whole life... and that was on a redrawing of "Fear" (looks like "The Scream", also same Artist) with Wax Colors
Brad[Laptop]: me too and it goes right in the trash
mentallyeffedguy: Talent? What is that
mentallyeffedguy yep!!
I might just try tracing some stuff to get my confidence up and see how that goes
drawing! :P its kindof a talent
mentallyeffedguy: It is :3
I'm trying to do my best as well
talent is a big part of how fast you learn, I figure
sure you can make it to 1000
I rarily say good things about my Creations, but that probably the best thing I have ever done in my live -.-
How much do tablets run for?
mentallyeffedguy: Awesome :D
KnifeH: A talent is a natural gift. Like a cutie mark is based of that ponies talent. :)
nono mentallyeffedguy make that 201
:D
I just want to be able to draw ponies good enough to draw them randomly on things
hahahaha Sonny cool
Klumzeedragon: My cutiemark is a booze bottle
lol
Anyone know how much a tablet runs for today?
AJIsAwesome drawing tablet?
from cheap to expensive
I think 50-500 and up
AJIsAwesome: Depends. Do you want crap or good?
Brad[Laptop]: Yes.
Genius Vivix.
hehe
'Cheap to expensive'
I r smru!
KnifeH: Good.
AJIsAwesome 50-3000, depends what you want
Hi, Good afternoon everyone
there
KnifeH: You like drinking? :D
AJIsAwesome: If good, 160 dollars, considering a small tablet but good quality
but yeah 50-70 for cheap, and around 300-700 and more for great I guess
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
Hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
hi
/me glomps TheGreatAndPowerfulT
KnifeH: How much is yours?
My channel http://www.youtube.com/user/Alphahumphrey2011?feature=mhee
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Hi! :)
http://www.letsgodigital.org/images/artikelen/71/wacom-bamboo-fun-tablet.jpg I draw with this
Hallo TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
It's nothing
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
If I would have a cutie mark it would be...
CCCP: In a way, I agree. But at the same time... So many people would be completely outraged to have that right taken away. Some people enjoy shooting at ranges and stuff as a pass time or a hobby. They arent all used to as personal defense or murder weapons.
Mine was the price I quoted.
/me is lucky as hell he got a tablet for free from his BFF
KnifeH lol i own one of those
CCCP: That's what I draw with :p
Applejack2012 Careful to link something like your own youtube channel as you are advertising without mod permission plus it's youtube so you are breaking two rules there bud
KnifeH: Ok. Thanks.
KnifeH: Same! but I have Large
Applejack2012 youtube is considered video links and when theres a stream it's not allowed
KnifeH: I don't know what my cutie mark would be. :P But a booze bottle sounds awesome. :D
Klumzeedragon yeah i know... but still out of all the problems the right of owning guns seems pretty unimprtant.
Klumzeedragon: :D
AJIsAwesome it really depends on the size of the table as well, how much of a drawing surface you want
CCCP: whats wrong with owning a gun?
Brad[Laptop]: Okay. Thank you.
interesting, so we can take MLP and put it into our own stuff...?
KnifeH: you have the best tool to draw with i see :P
Bronysith guns kill people
I just wanted show KnifeH my Youtube adress as he just showed his link
killerpony7733: Although it is a youtube link, it's not a video link and therefore doesnt break that rule? 6_9
mentallyeffedguy: No man. I'm spending 2800 dollars on a new tablet in a few months
CCCP: Incorrect, guns don't kill people. People kill people.
CCCP: so? why is the right to own a gun stupid?
KnifeH: I got mine 2nd hand, 50 quid
AJIsAwesome ugh -_-
AJIsAwesome: even then the bullet is the one to kill
KnifeH: lol veldig bra, veldig bra
Klumzeedragon youtube link=techinally a video link+self advertisement still breaking rules
JUst saying.
Jadå
CCCP: tell me why the right to own a gun is stupid?
NOW
bra Knife!
Ja för helvete
AJIsAwesome Once a gun is convicted of murder, then guns kill people.
:D
CCCP: look at what you've done! I was saying earlier that this is a conversation you couldn't tempt me to get in on :P
Bronysith look at any other country without the right to owning a gun and then the US. US the highest rate of death by guns
Guns are for people that try and shoot Scootaloo trying to fly
Big dislike.
CCCP: I'm not as passionate about it as I am some of the other arguments I've had, and while I do have an opinion, I'm boycotting such a never-ending discussion here :)
killerpony7733 reserach that statistic, it also includes suicides.
CCCP: Well, even if we didn't have that ammendmet, people would still illegally aquire guns and kill and rob and we the standard citizen wouldnt be allowed to have our own protection and even if we did, we'd be breaking the law for it.
Brad[Laptop] So it only adds to how bad it is cause the US allows it
killerpony7733: i think in sweden every household has a machine gun, correct me if im wrong Wrek
super wrong I think
05and axe
KnifeH: kjennar du Wrek siden han e svensk og du e svensk?
CCCP: Also if all guns were gone, we'd just find other ways to kill eachother. People are stupid. :P
tSparx D:
But why is "everyone does it anyway" an excuse to accept it?
mentallyeffedguy: Ja, jag är svensk
Oh people use cocaine, might aswell fucking legalize it
CCCP: but those are bad people boy, the right to own guns is the right to defend yourself
Bronysith the best you can own of a gun is if you are a hunter or the likes and it can only be non combat shotguns and hunting rifles
We dont have the right to own guns in canada, only with a special license you can have them. Guess what? All the criminals have them either way.
CCCP: You have fun with it, I'll be back when you're done :P
Wrek: Skype!
CCCP: take away that right and then only bad people have guns
^
And that's a bad thing?
And I'm Danish
KnifeH: eg vet at du e svenska, det står jo på profilen din :P kjennar du Wrek ?
Klumzeedragon yeah i guess.. It just seems like the debate about the 2nd ammendment never goes anywhere just a shout at the other side and no one gets anything done...
CCCP: THATS POLITICS
mentallyeffedguy: Har mött honom på BUCK
lol
^
KnifeH: ka e buck?
Baail~
Bronysith its hard to find the "Bad" people
mentallyeffedguy: Brony UK
Vivix: the norwegian MF
will doctor Who be on later?
mentallyeffedguy, Ke?
05guns dont kill people people kill people, and monkeys do to
Vivix: excacly
SafariMonkey: The question you really wanna ask is, "Is Sumi streaming later?"
Wrek: You kill society with that pic you're drawing.
I approve.
Wrek: guns dont kill people, i kill people, with guns!
tSparx: Same question really. :P
Someone put Scootaloo in rehab
aah Wrek she looks so cute
CCCP: That's a discussion. :) We all have an opinnion. It just helps to make both sides see the point eachother is stating. Im open minded in my debates.
13but i think the gun helps wrek
Silence, Vivix
13you don't just run up to somepony und go BANG
scootaloo is awesome
Hey guys! :D
;__;
OH GOD PHOENIX WRIGHT OST with orchestra, SO FUCKING AWESOME
Klumzeedragon yes but with Guns it never gets anywhere
And now the mods are in on it too. :P
KnifeH : Scoot is best CMC
13especially not if you have access to your grandfather's arsenal
CCCP, true, noone ever agrees on that issue
Maid_RainBow: YES
Bronysith true that :)
Scoot is best chicken
Oh mother of god
even the mods are talking in the chat about guns now
we're doomed
Guys, is Sumica streaming later? I gotta get my Who fix.
Applejack2012: just lost 85% of my respect
00,10no, got work tonight
Bronysith btw have you seen the Phoenix Wright 5 screenshots?
13silly fillies i am making references with wrek
05Shizuka <3
Aw
Lil_B: nope
Scoot is best filly
Shizukai think heavy does just go to people and go bang
Sumica: Aaw...
Applejack2012: Can't change it
13no trixie, he goes up to people und goes POW
13totally different :3
Bronysith don't, unless you like a more... 3D Style
Scootaloo hasn't have any wings O_o
Sonny: Not yet...........
Sonny: it will come!
..
you lie
:o
Shizuka different caliber :p different sounds :p
She's laying on her side
And there's a booze bottle in the way
You wouldn't see them
Sumica: See how selfish I am? I don't care that you've got work, only that I won't see Doctor who on here
Free Love!
wow
d'aww
I do really. :P]
drunk scootaloo...
Wrek: Awy yeah, you did it right
I am sorry twilight_sprinkle
i put a hat on Shizuka
Art trade
wrek have to do it
CCCP: Sure it does, I see what you're saying and I agree that it is stupid and pointless... :S But I mean, that would just leave all the bad people with the illegal guns they can get their hands on while the innocent get none for protection. Cause it's not the good citzens doing all the shootings. It's mainly the people that acquire them illegally.
haha 20% more awesome Cider xDxD
:p
Tl;dr
KnifeH: eh, i can always pause stream. altho some things cannot be unseen

CCCP: Yes

Maid_RainBow: This skit is getting too silly! I demand it be stopped at once!
Who called scoots a chicken again?

CCCP ahhh well you got a lot to go

Klumzeedragon : scoot is not chicken :'(
KnifeH: Applebloom
ScootaChicken*
Amber: Silence, I shall not be reduced to believe that a hick is a good CMC
CCCP I only follow a very select few series, and breaking bad is one of the 4 i follow.
CCCP: Yeah, you can get season 3 and 4 on Netflix then. :)
Its very well done, good writing.
I should stream on bronystate XD
It'd be fun doing art in front of people
Maid_RainBow: I knooooow~ Twas a joke in all good fun. :)
Brad[Laptop] yes i agree its one of the best shows on TV
Klumzeedragon : i know it is but i just dont like it
KnifeH: Actually, I would like to see what you stream. It would be nice to see how you draw.
CCCP season 5 is last season, 8 episodes just finished airing and they will air the last 8 episodes summer of 2013, then the series is over forever.
AJIsAwesome: I got livestream for that for now XP
KnifeH: Generally, streamer if and only if mod. But, you never know :)
Brad[Laptop] woah!
i hope it stays awesome
CCCP: If you don't mind torrents, you can torrent Season 5 as the episodes come out.
I don't know what Dr. Who is
Maid_RainBow: Aw. Then I apologize. :)
CCCP they never let the quality of the shows down, i figure they are going out on a high note by stopping at season 5.
Klumzeedragon yeah i know but im lazy
hi everypony :) back from school
Hurr. Thanks.
CCCP theres lots of streaming sites too.
Brad[Laptop] i agree

I'm watching The Hunger Games.... I'm crying at a certain part... :'( :(
CCCP: I mean I have all of season 5 torrented. :) I've watched the first 4 on Netflix.
thelonepony: east US?
CCCP: The list of things I have to do/watch/read/consume is already far too large, chances are good I won't see Breaking Bad for years -- and I'm fine with that *shrug*
What do you guys think the next spyro game should be?
Klumzeedragon oh lol
Hunger games is too dark for me, I probably wouldn't like to read it.
There is only one episode on The Ticket Master only with Scandinavian dub
DVD
tSparx your missing out i personally think even though hard to compare with FiM i think its better than FiM
AppleDash: Just one? I thought they bundle more episodes. So it's just that one?
TAB FAIL!!! :|
Brad[Laptop]: I know, I've seen the first 4 seasons, I'm just on BronyState all day. So I never get a chance to watch season 5. :P
Applejack2012: Just one? I thought they bundle more episodes. So it's just that one?
Only one but a Twilight figure was included
anyone know when the new season starts?
Applejack2012: Ok. How much do the DVDs run for?

CCCP: Lauren Faust of course

MrMalk: Hi! :)
Now, you get to college and skip class, they dont care at all :D
Ravebrony: Yep. :D
AJIsAwesome maybe i missed somthing horrible
Hi, everypony! :)
Hello Rue-Fan6414
AJIsAwesome I gotta go to the hospital in around a hour
hi Rue-Fan6414
Obsidian lol
Rue-Fan6414: Hi! :)
Hello Rue-Fan6414
MrMalk: Oh no, what happened?
hi Rue-Fan6414
:)
My teacher told the class "Pshh, if you think I care whether or not you're here, you're sadly mistaken. Just know that I won't review a Thing for you"
tSparx grandfather
school is pointless
Ravebrony: Yep, just like most professors in my classes.
Ya :D
CCCP: No it's not. You learn valuable things.
MrMalk: Prayers/good thoughts your way
Buffering!
AJIsAwesome like?
the Buffer Show!
What happened to stream?
CCCP: You probably just don't like the way they administer the information.
tSparx thanks he should be ok though Im not completely sure
Yeah, here too
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Gummy Tries All Day Long
That chat derp.
CCCP: You learn the fundamentals of Life! :D
CCCP: It's only as useful as you make it.
CCCP: My school is pointless, today was the first day back and they sent 50 people home for incorrect uniform :|
What "fun" is there to life?
But I'm going to be a little quite as I work on the art I'm drawing. :P
Ravebrony i dont think i need school to get taught that...
MASF123: The fun that you make of it.
But what fun?
/me Insert dancing frog to go with the stream:..........HELLO MY BABY, HELLO MY DARLING!
*out of it*
MASF123: Sex, drugs, good music, a nice hike, comedy, a roller coaster, sitting with someone you love, etc. etc.
MASF123: Varies between the person.
MLP_Brovakiin my school doesnt have uniforms which is the only good part
Hello my ragtime Gaaal~
SO I should try drugs? :S
o_o
tSparx: Don't forget ponies
MASF123 depends
CCCP: Mine cares more about the uniform than the education
MASF123: I don't see why not?
Drugs are Never the answer, nor is death.
Because I've always been suicidal, maybe drugs should be a step in the right direction.
MLP_Brovakiin: How strict uniform? Here we wear suits of our own. They just collected a load of old skirts and said if girls had inappropriate skirts they'd have to change into them.
weed isnt a drug >.>
Well, I'm off to get some lunch. See you in a little while! :)
oh....weed you mean.
is the stream over or is my pc messing up again??
Wuuuut
hello QuinnThePegaSistta :)
Buffer!
Stream is derped
get the cook
Weed is a drug, just as tobacco or coffee is.
hey CCCP
Its the buffer show
coke*
SirGanjalf exactly
^
CCCP: Weed is too a drug, what defintition are yo uusing?
tSparx weed is a plant
CCCP: weed affects your physiological processes significantly, so yes it is.
or should i saw Canabis...
CCCP: And? So is aspirin
its also a drug CCCP
SafariMonkey at least its not negative
Lol. A "drug" is any type of medicine or pill that can be abused as an addcition. Yup Weed is a drug.
Drugs are bad mmmmk?
CCCP: Unless you mean weeds. :p
Mmmkay?
Anypony here like The Hunger Games?
I do
Rue-Fan6414: the book is good
Rue-Fan6414: the book or movie
SafariMonkey lol
Rue-Fan6414: movie is terrible
not really :'(
didnt read the book... buuut, the Movie is good :D
SafariMonkey: They said to us that if girls wear tight trousers they will be sent home because it apparently "Distracts learning" So yep very strict rules
MASF123: That's not a good definition of a drug, because the psychadelic drugs are all non-addictive (via physical mechanism at least -- *anything* can be psychologically addicting).
BladedWings: Both
Not the biggest fan
Obsidian: Right, ponies, duh!
Rue-Fan6414: oh well then never read the book and never seen the movie :D
That is the definition of a drug
herion is supposdly an orgasim X10 in the gut for a long time....
And das bad
When I am feeling down, she has always got my got my back. Hmm...hm...hmm...something giant hat. Yes I love my sister Rarity!
CCCP: It's more like bliss then sleep. Oh, and terrible, terrible addiction.
Same old chat. THe minute stream is dead, it turns to drugs6_9
Lol!
what's on next?
tSparx its only addictive if you let it be... jk
Speaking about drugs: Anyone here watching "Breaking Bad"?
Because i've started recently...
It's on my list of things to watch
Weed stinks so bad.
is that CrazyCherry gone?
MLP_Brovakiin: Here girls can wear skirts, knee length. Boys need smart jackets and trousers that hold a crease. we also need dress shirts and ties.
Ravebrony: Drugs are never the *answer*, but boy are they fun
I'm watching Malcom in the Middle right now :P
hello

SafariMonkey: It's pretty good
I don't know how people can tolerate that smell.
Yeah I know, it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlj6-d5jrbs&feature=plcp
's kind of funny
MASF123: I always loved that smell, haha, long before I even knew what it was :P
SirGanjalf oh yeah i heard that... i love Breaking Bad
Getting High must be one hell of a trip.
MASF123: Some people really hate the smell, some people love it.
The ONLY time drugs are fun to me are when other people use them at raves. They act like idiots, and can do whatever to them and they dont care :D (because they dont know)
ScottishUnicorn: Yeah, especially when you compare both characters
Almost never any middle ground :)
ScottishUnicorn: Should that be addressed to CCCP?
Holy Shit its on youtube! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fyGrPL2Pdo
00,10So how about that newsletter eh?

tSparx, but it stinks that like some liking the smell ofage bags garb
MASF123: It's *nothing* like it's usually portrayed in media, with the hallucinations and crap. But it is fun.

CCCP: Lets see how long it lasts
Sumica, abut that Newsletter. :)
Eli: Welcome to the buffer show
CCCP: One ep
Obsidian you mean before its taken down?
Sumica: who would win in a fight? pinkie pie or deadpool?
MASF123: Some people think it stinks, some people like the smell, idk why, it just is that way -- independently, usually, of whether they use the drug or not
/me smacks keyboard.
Obsidian: ohhh my favourite
CCCP: Pretty much
Obsidian been around for about a year...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Is6HeUAAA&feature=plcp
Bronysith: Epic battle that would start off bad for Pinkie, but she'd ultimately win
Deadpool is OP so I'd say...Pinkie Pie.
CCCP: Then they got lucky
Obsidian: i could watch that thing go round and round all day long
MASF123: But if he's OP, doesn't that mean he'll win automatically?
00,10Pinkie

Sumica, I'm gonna put MASF Reload as my name ok?
spitfirecolt: Helping people is definitely awesome.

/me waves everypony bye and /)
(\
tSparx: Nevr played either...
wait...chat derp?
SafariMonkey: Have you played an Zelda games?
I agree with tSparx
zelda 1 or 2 which is better for the nes
nope
I think it's the uniqueness of Majoras Mask compared to the others
so don't you some ponies don't like the moopster?
/)
spitfirecolt: Well Zelda 2 was on the SNES, wasn't it?
tSparx: ...
i like moopster it was on the nes
spitfirecolt they are too different for me to decide which one is better :/
I had to hoof-wash these damn clothes. :/ Hands are so puny.
pruny.
Bronysith: Was?
No, living where I did the *only* game I had was pokemon crystal (bear in mind DS was already out :P )
tSparx: no
NOOOO
no i mean why though?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
tSparx Son, I'm dissapoint
tSparx: ZELDA 2 IS FOR THE NES
STFU :P
is it because im mean sometimes?
I never played Zelda games, sadly
tSparx: I AM ERROR
It was like 20 years ago (or it feels that way)
I haven't owned an NES or SNES since I was *9*
tSparx last year was Zelda's 25th anniversary
now and then i will play zelda 1
Lil_B: Twenty years sicne I first played them (showed up late to the Nintendo/video-games-in-general party)
Look, I have spare time!!!
me too
My first games were Spyro and Diablo :3
I love you...LOVE YOU....LOVE YOU, LOVE YOU...Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo- :S
Didnt play much else :D
Lil_B: In point of fact it has been less than 20 years, only 13 I think
I got my first LCD game in 1983
LCD?
i love spyro
Spyro was great.
Weh ninsomniac had it...
I have never owned a NES or SNES (or at least played with them) , N64 was my first
Love Spyro too
Until Insomiac Games sold their license.
I can't make movie night. I have choreography, then I have a game early the next morning, along with a second sessin....:|
*When insomniac
MASF123: Yeah...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEChu3hnJhU&feature=BFa&list=FLaKCn8LyYp3lQWFAHcm9znA
I cant look at todays Spyro games
Confusingly, I got PSX, then N64, then SNES, then NES, then I sold the Famicon and SNES, then later sold the PSX and N64 to get the PS2, then got a Gamecube, then it broke.
Eeeeehehehe! The tentacle enemies in this game are described with "still waiting for his day" :D
LCD was like Game & Watch
Combining Fluttershy with Skrillex?
It needs about 20% cooler
what has this world come down to
My first console was a PS1. I never had anything before that :\
Just hear the whole thing...It's really good.
i believe mine was a SNES
Kawaii_icybeauti, I despise THAT kind of dubstep
