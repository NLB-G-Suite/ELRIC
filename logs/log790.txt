not sure if warhammer pony...

Platformers=RPGs, IMO.
/me noms on cookeh
11,02Chrysalis: Umm...yesh? o.o
that was one thing that annoyed me about sticker star alot
not upgrade per experiance
you didnt need to fight anything
you have to FIND them
/me is booped /)u(\
not earning them by experiance
They arent that fucking hard to find
And boo hoo you cant level up.. DEAL WITH IT

Never fails

ALSO
THE STORY
11,02Chrysalis: Yesh O.O
The story is non-existant
Right...because people play games for story
need I say more? :)
miyamoto said they didn;t need a story
the story is nowhere
*Boop* :3
and getting all nostalgic
Erm...so he didnt speak...he never spoke in the regular series anyway
11,02Chrysalis: What's that?
why do you think people are pissed he didn;t talk this time
image hosting
/me is pooked O.O
he doesn't even say anything at the beginning
Again..most people play games and ignore the story
wow
you are terrible
I played through it and I never gave a shit
Gonna kill myself some zombies :3

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_hKLfTKU5Y
brilliant writing, great gameplay, nice badge system
wat?
you were just saying how the gameplay of sticker star was like the old papeer marios
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn-_sDp-OBI
As for Sticker Star, it's alright!
the story
The gameplay was pretty lacking
They were trying something different...
sombody make something with juggling twilight
I get that
but Sticker is nothing like an RPG
HEY GUYS WHAT'S GOING O- oh, the stream is off.
at all
Guys, stop giving Sticker Star a bad name! I mean, geesh, it's not Luigi's Mansion!
Luigi's Mansion was good
....in itself
Its not the same as thousand
it just very insulting
cdi games was da best
it's like nuts and bolts
yes it is
insulting
we got something entirely different
But again its a fun game...to me anyway
TinStar for SNES.
italian plummers r srs bsns
well yeah it's pretty fun
shit my second hdd just ded
Gnight everypony, gotta rest for tomorrow :)
hi.
after some sector a solid wall of bad blocks

That and Epic Meal Time.
No.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKj3NamQNqs
Because my taste just keeps constantly changing.
then don't talk about the second one
At least the first had somewhat of a challenge
2 was just slam meteors and win
yeah I kinda agree that they could've done something else for that
I thought Ustream was great for videogames
11,02CrystalPhoenix: Because I forced to use it with my capture card.
The challange seemed a tad toned down in 2 from 1
loading the justin.tv player in a frame is not allowed
dang it
http://i.imgur.com/Ekkh0.jpg
sooooo good
I would like some coffee.
I still have my disc in good condtition
I still need to get all the badges and recipes.
I have had that thing for years
11,02Anyone else having issues with stream?
11,02I'll drop the quality some more
well except for the weird ratio I'm fine
like it look squished
Lol
11,02Better now?
11,02MadSurge: /)^3^(\
oh lawl
Is mario's email the intor tune to world?
I meant the stream quality
I knew I heard that before
Maybe because I never let it play the whole way
11,02Aspect ratio looks fine
The Brick Frog!
But only for some e-mails.
oh another thing about Sticker Star
That sort of bugged me but I never got bothered by it too much
hello
cause that kinda removed some strategy aspect
Thats being a bit picky though...
*used
lol
since there are enemies that have priorities
"Loading the Justin.tv player in a frame is not allowed."?
twilight should juggling with over ponies
:P
7Oh good because I was running out
Goombario/goombella is kinda usless when you get to spiked foes

I usually only used them for tattles and swapped out

Good old Watt
Watt is overrated
That looked like it should have made sense, but it didn't.
no stream
There's a stream, refresh
yes there is
oh!
i see it now
thanks
Do the species like that one that held watt hostage even have a name?
oooh stream?
I called them sheet ghosts
Oh, I LOVED Counterattacking in TTYD.
no like seriously
You have to be good on timing to use counters effectivly
Hi Afflac.
hey
but when mastered
I barley used countering because I was kinda shit with it
You cant be touched?
how you guys doing?
11,02XAX: Probably :P
since it counters EVERYTHING
Horse != pony
Glitzpitt time?
Oh wait... thats later
7also Javik is best squadpony
Sub plot?
but there's a story in each place you visit
yes
we didn't get that DLC
That fucker of a guard is still there?
Blocking allows a certain amount of frames to go by before you have to push the A button. Countering is the same thing, but you're allowed to give dmage and not take any at the cost of not having a lot of frames to work with in terms of blocking, IIRC.
lol that works I guess
*adorable
11,02DinkyDoo: You have to either use a non-Chrome browser or go to the link provided.

Oh.
Thats kinda nice I suppose
I actually filled out my tattle log. :$

I actually bought all the books and read them. :D
Luigi's last partner is weird
The music in the train ride is FANTASTIC.
i cant read that fast
see why can't we have this instead
I want to make a pony crossing sign and replace the deer crossing sign along my road with it.
make it look real though haha.
If I recall he's only been caught once
7SR, where do you fall on the idea that the whole 'next level of study' thing for Twilight is her becoming an alicorn?
I don't read that far into the series.
use shell
But if I did, I would say that ponies are born the way they are, and don't "transform".
I never did.
Twilight would be too overpowered as a main character
for some sort of mission.
I gauge the cost of one episode to around $650,000
woo
Is the "Double Pain" badge ever useful?
o.o damn
I've never found a use for it.
Didn't you learn anything from magic duel?
Seinor stompy AWAY!
Such spells are impossible :P
stepped on wat
7That /Twilight/ has her limits.
oh
Bitch needs glasses
But really, we are debating a show where ponies talk.
just go get Rarity
she must have some leftover contact lenses
but but, it was the _alicorn_ amulet
THIS MOUSE
7and impossible for her /so far/. She hasn't been studying that long - the Princesses have had a thousand years (at least) to fuck around and figure shit out.
Fund him
no really fund him
I don't think they actually laid out "groundwork" where rules exist for the ponyverse.
FUND HIM EVERYTHING
whats possible and whats not.
12 oz mouse
7well, we know that Celestia controls the sun and moon in Equestria, but not the everfree forest. which is kind of impressive in itself
that's actually pretty dangerous when writers do that

Pikmin soon
7It concerns me that this is going to be a very Twi-centric season.
hai Saturn
It keeps me entertained.
the second to last season got completely crazy because of that
and everyone hated it
also, my plans got ruined
for the season finale i was going to rent that theatre
I've never really liked Twilight all that much

11,02xles: Cool :3
Well, sketched, rather.

but really there were just a couple lines through the screen

TRIXIE:|

She's NOT pleased with the situation. ;)
Remember the Tetris commercial?
also lol.. we are doing a gift exchange with our family
Hello
There are two brads and no one knows which one is which
There was a Tetris commercial?
I dont think they thought that through before they sent the email out with the list of names....
I'm probably too young for that one
We have a few people in my family with the same names like that
lol
......
I'm 21
Hi
hi
;o
O
Oh here we go!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZV9IlTJcIg Now before you laugh, remember its 1985
Meh
haha, yeah that was way before my time
wankers knocked me out 7 times, and dislocated 3 joints
I ususally have more than 10 by now
but i gave more than i got
I didn't even start watching TV with commercials until probably like 1999
also, dislocated 5 sholders
oh
and knocked out 10 people
The commercials from when I was like 10 years old on the cartoon channels are the same commercials they play today.
haha that's awesome
:3
For example, the Yop commercials
Dis slideshow.
do you guys get the Yop commercials?
uhhhh
:O
I played that
Yop as in the yougurt drinkl
I'm not familar with it
yogurt
Because no offense but I usualy have at least 15/20 at this point
Oh lol
maybe its just a canadian product.
offense taken!
ow
hay everypony why is episode 8 and 9 on the same day
They have been using the same commercial for as long as I can remember.
ONO
I have no idea where it even came from or anything
No
I had Roller Coaster Tycoon at home though
And Zoo Tycoon had a dinosaur expansion
Roller coaster tycoon 1 was the best.,
it still is the best.
wow is that book a pokedex
somewhat close to one
Hey, all.
Problem with the stream?
The games I played in school were all educational
But they were actually fun
11,02Bronysith: Probably cause I'm playing it :P
Is there much point to a stream that can only run in a separate tab?
someone needs to adapt roller coaster tycoon 1 into a browser based game'
that would be awesome
port it to html5 and javascriuopt.
well you cant really port it
but you can recreate it.
wouldnt be easy though
I would die
Style~
11,02Twitch is weird like that
yeah
yeah

11,02PaperSpade[R]: Yes
Thats why i just think this is risky to me, I never really played like this
Goodnight everyone :)
11,02sub06905: Yesh o.o

He's focusing quite intesnely while playing it until
i agree
out of the blue while he was about to do his last hit on the koopaling
if you make a pony OC, DONT GIVE IT A BACKGROUND
EVER
The fact they use the coin thing as a selling point seems lazy
a racecar came out from the side with an odd looking man yelling out
TURBOTASTIC
Can I get warm chocolate milk and a bedtime story? :3
well, i already have my uber awesome OC already though

or that kirby eats entire buildings, swallowing their souls and taking their powers
amen
Like I said, Kirby's a mainly simplistic creature. He's not exactly the most sentient being on the planet.
fail
kirby is evil
how unfortunate
That fail
That didn't work
I assume Meta Knight is kirby except with morals and compex thought
Plus, Kirby was woken up prematurely. He's not supposed to be that way.

well its drawn in the style that Redline is, but it still a cool pic
08,01though she does have a mechanical hand

And how many have we run into the ground?
Um, maybe we're taking this a bit too far.
08,01Canadian_Brony: actually, this is why the word "fucking" is such a good expletive
trixie dancing carameldansen FTW lol
xD
Does "I blme Sxyprtdr" count as a meme?
08,01it has a lot of balance in its sound
T_T not G@K
maybe that's why I like to say "fuck" alot.
That, or because I'm a teenager :p
We created a meme and killed it in less than 24 hours
and then intellectual discussion about swear words
Haha.. just found out not to say that.

Saturn ok ok, gimme a minute to experiment with a few 1 syllable swear words and I'll get back to you in a minute.
08,01maybe just "fucking cocksucker" on its own is good enough
08,01yeah, i like that
:D
Saturn: Isn't it too many hard r and ks?
08,01especially if it's really out of the blue
"You fucking cocksucker"
/me spawns a wheelbarrel
08,01and in a posh english accent
/me cuts off the wheel
UNTZ
Or PONIIIIIIIIIII
08,01Vordox: i think the repetition of the "k" (rule of 3's), and the balance of the u's and the f make it good
Gimme 20$
Saturn: But there's 4 k?
08,01curses, i miscounted
PonyPonyPonyPony.swf
Fu(KK)ing (KK)o(kk)su(kk)er

08,01so even if there *are* people from the UK in here, i can't nerd out about shared childhood experiences
08,01because English people never got to experience The Singing Kettle
Sorry I live in shitty ole america
that last one was replaced with Nickolodeon while the States got the Hub

you get Hub
Is it good Nick?

Living in America hasn't made me pessimistic.
aww too fast. D:
no, its the bandwagon antiamerican thing
We et the odd Spongebob, but that's all post-movie garbage.
*get
08,01we even had our own children's songs in Scotland

Saturn: erm

where would they go?
forward in time or backwards

08,01and i have no idea how
>_>
Woot, sound gone

13this is fun
Saturn: I actually own a copy of The Merry Muses of Caledonia
08,01Unnr: it never ceases to amaze me how much you know about pretty much everything
slow it down at just the right time...
right?
Saturn: Its all Daaaark magggic
Going to be such a bitch during pony episodes

08,01Unnr: i remember having to memorise and recite Burns in primary school
BRB again play MW3
These how ever get annoying with the fact they stop the stream and just play a un skippable ad
08,01see kids, this is why scotland is awesome
08,01we have Rabbie Fucking Burns.
08,01(and MacGonagall...)
Hello Everypony
(and the whole of Hogwarts)
o/
08,01Unnr: i used to cycle past that school in edinburgh every day
08,01Unnr: also, the trick is either to chase the haggis the wrong way round a mountain, or to dig a pit and place an open bottle of whiskey inside it
I use Adblocker all the time.
Dat bass
<--- Whaaat...theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I could actually see and hear the stream while dealing with the ad
1?
08,01Kencolt: mostly lungs, liver, mince, and oats
08,01maybe some heart too
ustream works on phones, which is awesome imo
08,01and, of course, spices and seasoning
Nothing wrong with hearts and liver-- or mince. Always been a bit off about lungs tho.
08,01well, it's all edible
08,01and delicious
Saturn: and don´t forget the jigger of whisky, you can´t cook a proper haggis without it being slightly drunk
08,01dmanit, now i want haggis...
Lungs are gristle. And damn near nothing else. ENVER found a lung I liked.
NEVER.
08,01eeew, tinned haggis...
nothing is more foul than mass produced tinned haggis

Yeah, I kind of have a thing for music :$
i finished music school on guitar and remember nothing at all >.>
Well, you've still got the ear for different instruments
yeah, one thing i think ive retained is some music analysis techniques, although thats not very useful with most modern music as theres not much to analyze in them..
Sleep... I should try that.
unfortunately i never finished learning to play this on the guitar and havent icked it up since i finished http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfFbuT3I6A

I don't even know why we're listening to this.
we can have a sensible and mature discussion
it is my name
Oh this kid again
You tell me.
do you have an example?
gnaa
Surely you have one other thing to do.
its not my arguement
It isn't an arguement.

Cool story

Discussion isn't worth going on about.
I'm okay with that

https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/17/RJhVJSc7XUmkFE5UsKiQ6g2.jpg
We rarely get some here in SC XD
I do have to agree, it's something I think I should know more about. But if it's not up for discussion at the moment, that's fine.
00,10Supposedly he's some one that messed with Furrnet and some other sites
according to whom?
You mean Asturias?
Oh yeah, should've remembered that

Actually, I remember that part about PMing people.
00,10it's a bit more then that but yeah
banned from whole irc?
It's a possibility
or only this irc
00,10for sure this network,
00,10other networks it depends
Messing with websites
from gnaa?
he claims hes from gnaa

it's just a matter of time before we get some of the syndicated cartoons, like Gargoyles and TAILSPIN!!
I want to see Gargoyles. I've heard good things about it
Mainly about the villain
oh, at first is's soooo good.
I couldn't get into Gargoyles as a kid for some reason.
such good voice acting.
I foresee a downside to this when you say, "at first".
init half the cast of Gargoyles from Star Trek tng?
I knew the reason why people loved it, I just couldn't get into the show.
hi
It was a bit of a "transitional" cartoon i guess you could say.
*reasons
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
Oh dang
I missed Haruhi
I remember when I really liked it - I ended up moving later part of that year and we got sattelite and then I was hooked on DBZ on toonami hardcore lol.

Yeah, I couldn't. I selected all the zoom percentages, and it did squat

Paintchat was abandoned in 2003 I think- there's a lot of finnicky things to it- mangamasters has a lot of good tips on how to make it work when it breaks, but their site seems to be down
yeah- when I press zoom out the canvas breaks, hm
oh wait now, it breaks, then --flashes the screen, and then works
