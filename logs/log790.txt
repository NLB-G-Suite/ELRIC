You know what needs to be put in the slide show randomly?
One problem with using an IRC client on phone; You cannot watch both the sream and the IRC at once.
The pinkie pie g3 face
Except you have two phones
just for shits and giggles

glitchdetector: well it is a phone, being able to watch the stream on phone is already impressiv

Heya XAX :)
hoi XAX
you know who i miss
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMc1oA9bdbM
AlexS
hai XAX
For those that dont know - I fell for a scam that sent me a text saying I won a $1000 target gift card - link went to a target look alike website - red flag went up when it sent me to a page off site wanting more infor outside of email, phone #, and name - "you have to sign up for one offer before your card can be sent" - Beware ponies
Gah, I hate it when my chat crashes.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FikyTcteMvE.
i am best cake ever!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSiur8XNeiU
Ohai XAX!
i really want second EPRBOE
I love how there are no Targets in Norway
who wants a piece of me? :P
Chrysalis: What happened to AlexS?
aniderp|bestcakeever: you sure are <3
Chrysalis: That was the first Brony song I really got into.
AJIsHaunter i don't know, he just stopped uploading
GilDash ikr
that was the song that really got me into the fandom
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxGWkon7WdQ
well, that and your gonna go far kid
Chrysalis: I remember raving to it at BUCK. Good times. ^_^
GilDash: By the way, how was BUCK?
BUCK was the best damn thing ever
AJIsHaunter there are pictures...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVCFV7jT9ho

AJIsHaunter: Come time year!
*this
I keep singing this for no reason: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0efX3B51dU&list=FLmiZH8kuI4snGqdkIX2Z0LQ
big deal
why does it follow playlists ._.
i know another horse vid on youtube with 10 million views
The first brone song I ever heard was At the Winter Gala by Saltlakrits.
XAX also a good remixer
but i'll got banned for them
it started to rain just when our work was done :P but we got out 30 minutes early - not too shabby
WILL IT BLEND
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMIzhWt_pvY
THAT IS THE QUESTION http://youtu.be/ahtZayhxb5U
iv not really heard much about the new songs being remixed
Cypresswolf, why'd you fall for the scam in the first place, especially if you don't ever recall signing up to win $1,000 gift card?
It was dominian42 (Also known as Replacer) who really got the fandom, if I recall.
*got me into
I shop at target quite a bit - pony merch and groceries - I thought it was legit
i am worht a millllion dollars :P

/me pokes AdamTheDuck :3
:p
/me glomps thelonecubone :P
/me noms on AdamTheDuck :3
Oh god,
what?
I have to force myself to sleep
I dont go to 4chan - other than links to pics posted here
Cypresswolf, okay. If you get something that's asking for more than your name and address then you should automatically label it as scam
You guys keep me up all night
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG9E00Sa2lg perfect fit here

AJIsHaunter ikr, its not a bad song
SpadeKyruem[School], that's not the mid boss music for sticker star
Chrysalis: dat song was played on my class today, on a exam on linux
also, how many people did i just rickroll XD
Chrysalis: I prefer this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eDXhih_NW4
thats the boss music that always plays for minibosses
pony_3045: That....that's pretty interesting.
wait a sec... since when has BS an offline Dis show?

I don't like Paper Mario Sticker Star
00,10Well that explains all the hub and WB talk
it broke everything that was Paper Mario
00,10did not realise Animaniacts coming to the Hub
So whats the ghost chasing SuperBrony64 along with the anti guy and dark matter?
also this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
ohai Sumica
Ah. That's right.
it doesn't like a Paper Mario game at all
blobfish offends humans
it's not***
SpadeKyruem[School]: a ghost from Zelda I think
CrystalPhoenix: Waah waah
I saw the image ads for animaniacts on Facebook
Deal with it
Michael not seen that one in AGES
SpadeKyruem[School], I'm serious
BladedWings: she's the first female that ive been able to talk to nomally
Super paer mario wasnt a paper mario game so deal with it
MMMMBANANS
*paper
sticker star is a bad paper mario game
do u liek mmmmbananas
11,02SpadeKyruem[School]: Enemy from Kirby I think...
SpadeKyruem[School], it had RPG elements though
00,10now if they would just show it before or after ponies
:O Animaniacs on the Hub O_O Alright! It's official - Im canceling ALL my other channels - no need to watch anything else!
Chrysalis: remember when dari did a dub over that vid?
00,10it woud make for a great saterday
CrystalPhoenix: It tried to be a platformer rpg and it sucked
Ohai SuperBrony64 :)
SuperBrony64, the ghost?
SuperBrony64: Yeah, I had the same thought too.
:3
hey SuperBrony64 !
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXZbQ0ZI4E4
Dat moo
SpadeKyruem[School], yeah and Sticker Star is nothing of an RPG at all
00,10Ponies, animaniacts,aquabats, danVs
i dunno
God I love Gooper blooper's boss theme
Kipkat07_USAF: hmmm...well...like i said this is tough for me to help with :$
Sumica: now we just need Batman TAS
the boss theme is good
Bronysith i remember the mods doing some VERY wierd things on the quiet stream
oh wow, my controll doesnt work >:I
paper mario isnt terrible, it did remind me alot of Super Mario RPG
Sumica: so much awesome in one channel!
I LOVE Paper Mario
11,02Oh wait, the ghost is from Zelda
but Sticker Star?
Chrysalis: like when Nail-chan read the clopfics on the skype call ?
SuperBrony64: I knew it!
11,02Also, hai :D
Sticker star still has more rpg elements than super did
SuperBrony64: It was?
SuperBrony64: O hai
oh god
the only good tihng in that game are the puzzles in the levels
that was just stupidly funny
Super is more a platformer than anything
sticker star is simply a bad paper mario game
SuperBrony64: Also, mooooooo!
SpadeKyruem[School], HA name one
hi SuperBrony64
that's all you need to know
RPGs>Platformers
hai SB ^^
i havent played sticker star
hai SuperBrony64
There's no level, no upgrades
11,02AJIsHaunter: Yesh :3
http://i.imgur.com/AzjHl.png
Well the fact it actuall has turn based battles
11,02MadSurge: Moooooo
hello SuperBrony64. Vee
want a cookie SuperBrony64 ?
oooh that twilight
Bronysith: nope. It's the opposite for me
11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: O.O yesh
SuperBrony64 you silleh filleh today
moo
-gives cookie-
i was raised on the RPG
not sure if warhammer pony...
all the moos
Bronysith: THey're both equal to me.
11,02Chrysalis: Everyday /).(\
No upgrades? Than what the fuck are the hearts
Platformers=RPGs, IMO.
Moo ^o^
/me noms on cookeh
did you ever find clothes SuperBrony64?
SpadeKyruem[School], you mean those battle that can be avoid? since there's no use to play them at all?
hmmm, wonder if the cookie server is up
11,02Chrysalis: Umm...yesh? o.o
SpadeKyruem[School], the hearts are items
/me boops SuperBrony64 with a pillow :3
that was one thing that annoyed me about sticker star alot
The hp ups dumbass
not upgrade per experiance
Sindri Sparkle?
you didnt need to fight anything
you have to FIND them
/me is booped /)u(\
not earning them by experiance
They arent that fucking hard to find
you could just avoid the enemies and still beat the game
And boo hoo you cant level up.. DEAL WITH IT
/me still wonders what cooking a whole batch of cookie dough in a cake tray will end out
mario rpg/paper mario, Dr Mario, Mario Party, Super Smash Bros.
SpadeKyruem[School], and what about the partners
what's the point of putting enemies ina game if there is no reason to fight them?
where are they
You try something new and peopel always fuckign bitch
One giant cookie cake. I want to try that some day :3
Never fails
AdamTheDuck, a cookie cake or cake cookie thing
AdamTheDuck: Now that you say that, I wonder what that would be like too. :D
the problem is they didn't need to do anything new for paper mario
those are all good mario games that are not platformers
they just screwed it up
Still better than Super
it's dangerous to go alone take this http://cdn.zoopicture.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/blobfish_2.jpg
SuperBrony64: remember http://i.imgur.com/TgGKxh.jpg
AssaultWithEmbraces, it cna be whatever it is, once I tried it XD
so?
http://i.imgur.com/d2Rmx.png
who cares if it's better than super
doesn't mean it's a good paper mario game
it's still not a Paper Mario game
just means its a shineri piece of shit
ALSO
I love how no one gives a shit about super having no element from the first two paper games
/me pokes AdamTheDuck :>
THE STORY
11,02Chrysalis: Yesh O.O
The story is non-existant
/me licks AssaultWithEmbraces :3
fuck, Bowser didn't even speak
Also, Super Mario Bros. 2 (US)
/me glomps AdamTheDuck
Right...because people play games for story
need I say more? :)
they took the story out CrystalPhoenix
granted I haven't finished the game but yeah
SuperBrony64 saw the decent nights sleep in the idle stream
/me boops SuperBrony64 nose :3
miyamoto said they didn;t need a story
the story is nowhere
*Boop* :3
and getting all nostalgic
Erm...so he didnt speak...he never spoke in the regular series anyway
so started lookin through my imgur :P
Buytoast, well where's the motivation then
11,02Chrysalis: What's that?
he spoke in the papaer mario series
SpadeKyruem[School], you're kidding
/me noms on AdamTheDuck
why do you think people are pissed he didn;t talk this time
they shat all over papaer mario
/me pooks AdamTheDuck and SuperBrony64 :3
Besides you only run into the fucker at the end, what would he even say
image hosting
He spoke ever since Mario 64
/me is pooked O.O
Naked man jailed for climbing, biting London statue
and a paper mario without a story?
then what's the game?
he doesn't even say anything at the beginning
Again..most people play games and ignore the story
wow
you are terrible
cause paper mario was known for its brilliant writting as well
I played through it and I never gave a shit
Gonna kill myself some zombies :3
/me hugs Derpy_at_work
SpadeKyruem[School] thats because most games have no story
>:3*
and you're the reasom people are making crappier games
thelonecubone|DI: Good luck! :3
Im not nitpicky about every fucking detai;
or its appalling
all we need now is a mario strategy game like FFT :)
SpadeKyruem[School], though I can say it may be a cool idea and all but calling it Paper Mario is a sell-out
it's not a terrible game
but it's horrible to call it a paper mario game
who's streaming?
<.<
exactly
What game we're talking about?
sticker star
Paper Mario Sticker Star
Derpy_at_work: nobody :P
11,02Best Paper Mario game was The Thousand Year Door.
Derpy_at_work: No one atm.
yes
SuperBrony64, THANK YOU
Its still more a paper mario game than Super paper mario
Yes
SuperBrony64: Oh, I LOVED that game.
thousand year door was the pinnacle
SuperBrony64: Oh hi, you silly pony.
11,02i liek silleh :3c
Ok I have to admit thusand eyar door was great
SpadeKyruem[School], it's better than Sticker Star
super paper mario at least had a story and DIALOGUE
I really need to play that again
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_hKLfTKU5Y
but the fucking game play sucked
SuperBrony64: I liked all four of them, yes, even Super Paper Mario...that game made me cry...
brilliant writing, great gameplay, nice badge system
IT tries ot be a god damn platformer and a rpg
oh what now
SuperBrony64: Espectially its story.
Thousand years door?
wat?
you were just saying how the gameplay of sticker star was like the old papeer marios
and the rpg in super paper is non exsistant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn-_sDp-OBI
and now you're saying game play in 1000 year door sucks?
I never understand why the backlash on Super Paper Mario, it wasn't THAT bad.
make up your damn mind
No im talking about super
VenHur: I didn't mind the game.
Super got boring quick for me...
As for Sticker Star, it's alright!
Super Paper Mario had one great thing
the story
The gameplay was pretty lacking
people didn't like super too much because it strayed from the rpg ways
They were trying something different...
sombody make something with juggling twilight
and people don't like sticker star because it took the rpg ways and destroyed them until you got some crappy mush that they said was a papaer mario game
Super paper was a platformer trying to be a rpg
I get that
but Sticker is nothing like an RPG
They tryed to go for a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night-ish style for Super Paper Mario, but it's still counts as an RPG.
HEY GUYS WHAT'S GOING O- oh, the stream is off.
at all
I still found Sticker more interesting thatn Super
Guys, stop giving Sticker Star a bad name! I mean, geesh, it's not Luigi's Mansion!
So...
VenHur: I liked Luigi's Mansion. :S
Luigi's Mansion was good
Sticker Star is a cool concept it might be a great game
....in itself
Me too, man... :S
Ok I see your point
Luigi's Mansion was a great game. It gets too much shit from the peanut gallery.
Its not the same as thousand
why did they need to name it Paper Mario
But its a good game by itself
because papaer mario sells games
i cant spell paper
it just very insulting
cdi games was da best
it's like nuts and bolts
yes it is
insulting
Oh god nuts and bolts
Fuck that game
SpadeKyruem[School], See what we mean
But I still say its a good game regardless
people aren't hating too much on the game itself
we were promised a Paper Mario game
Crystal, stop bashing Paper Mario Sticker Star and go play something else, like Pac-Man for the Atari 2600.
You know what game needs more love?
just labeling it as a paper mario game
But yea..its not a paper mario game in the sense
we got something entirely different
But again its a fun game...to me anyway
TinStar for SNES.
italian plummers r srs bsns
well yeah it's pretty fun
shit my second hdd just ded
VenHur, have I said it was a complete horrible game
but shitty as a paper mario game
Gnight everypony, gotta rest for tomorrow :)
what is this
Night, Michael. :)
nite Michael
bye Michael
Nite Michael.
hi GoldenMic
hi.
after some sector a solid wall of bad blocks
Lemme guess, no-one here has heard of or played TinStar before.
Needs more Battletoads
It's 3:56 here in Mexico.
ihas
its the middle of school here in 'laska
9_9
>_> Doing my work...
o.o cool
it's middle of night here
http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/37166330716
GoldenMic: like everyone else here :D
I remember Battletoads, but no one seems to know about Battlemaniacs, the crossover game with Double Dragon, or the arcade game that had blood.
Lots and lots of them.
oh my fucking god, I think I'm having deja vu AGAIN
i thought before i read it that 3d pokemon would be stupud
AssaultWithEmbraces: How so?
stupid
AssaultWithEmbraces: happens to me everyday
but it actually kind of works.
I love this song, AND the anime it accompanies: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IETQ63aTdNM
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxCAqVsbxCU Go go Luigi's mansion theme!
Bronysith: oh mai
VenHur, I remember that game
molestia strikes again
VenHur: i liked battletoads...and i think i remember Battlemaniacs XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdMhTL5bZrs one of the best final boss themes EVER
Bronysith, so how was the ending
CrystalPhoenix: i dont know, havent seen it yet
There WAS a Battletoads cartoon, but it never made it past the pilot episode.
08,01Chrysalis: is that server still going?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zdR6KPW1f4
AssaultWithEmbraces: what deja vu are you having?
Bronysith, you haven't beat the final boss yet?
/me 08,01looks at his work, looks at the minecraft executable, looks back at his work
08,01goddamnit...
AJIsHaunter, I'm searching something on Reddit and I'm watching the food network and suddenly I get this weird feeling in my mind and it's like "omg this has already happened but it didn't"
This math program lacks ponies... and a comfirmation button
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiE3Jhtd85A Needs more Live and Learn
AssaultWithEmbraces: happens to me all the time :D
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Easy As Pie
Another brilliant Final boss theme http://youtu.be/Ckxy-i7Dc5U
CrystalPhoenix: Oh god FUCK YES
bayonetta has some awesome boss themes
CrystalPhoenix: Have you battled the Shroobs hidden in the game?
AJIsHaunter, I gotta admit I haven't played the game personally
Anyone that wants to see the Battletoads pilot episode, here is it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggmOeBnbyXI
RPGs usually have awesome music, final fantasy is a huge example, as well as chrono trigger and persona series
for me persona is all about BABYBABYBABY
VenHur: So many Surfer vibes. :D
Bronysith: oh of course lol, love FF's music
i thing FF was boring
So boromir, what's your comment on the upcoming episode?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdIFaHFHkpM
Boromir: One does not simply sleep in ponyville
also it's pretty simple actually
in RPG especially on final boss the music is supposed to make you feel pump up
DrawMotherbucker: one does not simply do spoilers in bronystate :p
Random note, I think Black White/Black white 2's elite 4 theme is the best in the series
Bronysith, I love RPG music.
^
^^
waitaminute
I haven't played Black 2 yet.
Shadow of the colossus has the best sound track EVER
HAY BACON STRIPS
BACON!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2ehDtwFR34
sausage>bacon
Needs more final fantasy
BACON TREE
I used to think that too Bronysith
Bacon=Sausage, IMO.
but bacon is better
how can you be so wrong
nah
nuuuu have my music playlist videos have been deleted, confound you copyright laws!
AJIsHaunter: Too true.
Sausage is much better
AJIsHaunter: that's actually technically true.
TheGentleManBrony, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8368/
though I remember this song pumping me up to no end http://youtu.be/lIuvjG3Egjo
i like sausages more than bacon
sausage is for people whose taste buds can't handle the food of the gods
i pity you
7I need to stop watching ME3 death scenes on youtube.
dat goddamn violin
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozx5p3tbxAg Go go Final Fantasy 6 boss theme!
AdamTheDuck, nice
Bacon is overrated
^
I change my nickname like every 3 days on here.
CrystalPhoenix: Galaxy 2's was good but the boss fight...eh
Bronysith: Blame society.
TheGentleManBrony: to continue ban evading?
AJIsHaunter: blame society videos?
That and Epic Meal Time.
SpadeKyruem[School], this is galaxy 1 I'm talking about
No.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKj3NamQNqs
CrystalPhoenix: I know
Because my taste just keeps constantly changing.
then don't talk about the second one
even though the final boss in the first game was pretty meh as well
At least the first had somewhat of a challenge
though it did pump me up to max
2 was just slam meteors and win
Not to beat a dead horse or anything, but the end of that game really did suck
so the final phase was really meh
yeah I kinda agree that they could've done something else for that
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu3hFJsTuok But god damn I loved the music for it
11,02Refresh embed everyone :)
but the final battle was pretty much the same as the other battles except with a bit more of difficulty
Oh hai twitch
/me licks SuperBrony64 :3
SuperBrony64, you're not using Ustream?
/me licks AdamTheDuck back :3
twitchy twitcha twitch
I thought Ustream was great for videogames
11,02CrystalPhoenix: No, I use Twitch for Gameplay
I have my Mario Galaxy cd lying around here somewhere
SuperBrony64, why?
how've you been AdamTheDuck
SpadeKyruem[School], I got the soundtrack of the second game :3
11,02CrystalPhoenix: Because I forced to use it with my capture card.
Galaxy was a blast to play. Galaxy 2 felt somewhat underwhelming, for some reason.
SuperBrony64 \:3/
shadow of the colossus has the greatest video game soundtrack ever
alexxm|foal, great on this lovely morning, just sipping on some lovely coffee. :3 You?
I sort of enjoyed Galaxy 2
/me uses the word lovely too much
So who is streaming this montage?
ohai Derpy_Hooves :)
I didn't understand a single thing in your sentence
Hello Derpy_Hooves :P
forced in what term
The challange seemed a tad toned down in 2 from 1
how've you been Derpy_Hooves
i'm good AdamTheDuck
HOLY SHIT
BEST GAME
THIS GAME :O
what game?
Derpy_Hooves: Paper Mario: The Thousand Year DOor. :)
inb4 SuperBrony64 gets bored and play BLOPS 2
11,02I'm bored, let's play CoD
SuperBrony64: No! :<
loading the justin.tv player in a frame is not allowed
that was long SuperBrony64
dang it
SuperBrony64, XD
11,02pony_4507: Yeah, you can't use Chrome to view within the embed.
http://i.imgur.com/Ekkh0.jpg
hold on its me glennglog22 gonna change name
admittingly I played the shit out of Thousand Year door
SuperBrony64: My audio and video's stuttering.
I need to play this game again
sooooo good
I would like some coffee.
I still have my disc in good condtition
Can I have some coffee AdamTheDuck?
I still need to get all the badges and recipes.
11,02AJIsHaunter: Better now?
I have had that thing for years
I remember I was stuck for a loooooong time against Mario
/me pours coffee onto the ground in front of TheGentleManBrony >:3
SuperBrony64: Sorry, no. It's still the same problem. :<
I still own my N64 cart for Paper mario as well
Why do I feel so evil this morning? :$
11,02Anyone else having issues with stream?
SuperBrony64: Don't worry about it, though. Just go ahead. :D
SuperBrony64, hmm, seems fine on my end
11,02I'll drop the quality some more
well except for the weird ratio I'm fine
like it look squished
Lol
/me glomps SuperBrony64
/me hugs Bronysith back :3
11,02Better now?
AJIsHaunter: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/16a84339985ab2e6f18482a64d588549.png so fluffy!
11,02MadSurge: /)^3^(\
still squishy
what
oh lawl
Is mario's email the intor tune to world?
I meant the stream quality
I knew I heard that before
MadSurge: daaaaaw fluffy!
MadSurge: So Fluffy!
I never could place it when I played Door
PaperSpade[R]: Yep.
Maybe because I never let it play the whole way
I usualy answered right away so maybe thats why
11,02Aspect ratio looks fine
In some cases, it would play the introduction to the game when you start up the new file.
The Brick Frog!
But only for some e-mails.
Also I wonder if Birdo will ever be in a "canon" mario game
Oh god dat battle theme
oh another thing about Sticker Star
you cannot choose who to hit
That sort of bugged me but I never got bothered by it too much
just another thing to add to the reason of why it can't be a Paper Mario game
hello
cause that kinda removed some strategy aspect
Thats being a bit picky though...
I never really uses that much strategy in paper mario from what I remember, I just destroyed everything in my path
*used
7That's like saying not to beat a dead horse or anything, but terraria is really like minecraft
7not to beat a dead horse or anything, EA are douches
lol
7not to beat a dead horse or anything, ubisoft have terrible DRM
PaperSpade[R], or maybe that's kinda automatic thinking for you
Then again...its been like ...what.. 2 years since I played Thousand year door last
7not to beat a dead horse or anything, this place is kinda dead
CrystalPhoenix: again I havent played door in about 2 years so my memory may be foggy
since there are enemies that have priorities
I'm afraid I don't get half your references
7not to beat a dead horse or anything, spyro as a franchise is swiftly unravelling
"Loading the Justin.tv player in a frame is not allowed."?
7not to beat a dead horse or anything, BioWare generally have good storytelling in games
twilight should juggling with over ponies
7not to beat a dead horse or anything, racism is bad.
Not to beat a dead horse or anything, but I get it already, sheesh
:P
7Oh good because I was running out
not to beat a dead horse or anything.. but
/me beats dead horse
Goombario/goombella is kinda usless when you get to spiked foes
for Celestia pleasure
I usually only used them for tattles and swapped out
PaperSpade[R], http://derpy.me/dGofG Hello
jcelios: it doesnt work with chrome on this page, you need to copy link into another rab
*tab
CrystalPhoenix: Oh god those fuckers
PaperSpade[R], also don't underestimate Goombario
/me makes a clever reference about MLP characters
7Anyway. Yes, the ending sucked. Yes, from a lore point of view the re-purposing of starchild generally made it better and, in my opinion, made it an acceptable plot point however it was still incredibly cheap, felt cut short, and didn't have half of the features that it should've, or that we were promised.
if you can charge that boss of a partner enough you can kill a boss so easily
guys
hello MLP_Brovakiin
guys
Good old Watt
Watt is overrated
That looked like it should have made sense, but it didn't.
Hai Pinkie_Clone :)
who remember this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oE8PhNMjqM?
pony_3045, no non-image links during streams please.
no stream
There's a stream, refresh
yes there is
and I can see that SuperBrony64 still doesn't B counter
oh!
pony_3045, refresh.
11,02Please no YouTube links during stream pony_3045 :)
i see it now
B counter is OP
thanks
Do the species like that one that held watt hostage even have a name?
oooh stream?
I called them sheet ghosts
Chrysalis: Paper Mario :D
Oh, I LOVED Counterattacking in TTYD.
Not me, I didn't even play the game most of the way through :P
oh... thanks sb
no like seriously
You have to be good on timing to use counters effectivly
Hi Afflict
PaperSpade[R], of course
Hi Afflac.
hey
but when mastered
I barley used countering because I was kinda shit with it
You cant be touched?
I also love the music as you approach the TTYD.
SuperBrony64: Isn't the final boss, or one of the bosses in this game, kind of disturbing? apparently...
B counter can pretty much make you cruise into the game without any damage
XAX: You'll see.
how you guys doing?
11,02XAX: Probably :P
since it counters EVERYTHING
We're beating dead horses apparently :P
Horse != pony
XAX quite
Maniac Mansion theme just so awesome
but no spoiler
Glitzpitt time?
PaperSpade[R], unfortunately
Oh wait... thats later
I fucking love the Glitzpit
Best part of the game
7also Javik is best squadpony
what I LOVED about Paper Mario is that not only is there a main story
but there's a story in each place you visit
yes
we didn't get that DLC
CrystalPhoenix: Because I remember watching a video on top [number here] most disturbing bosses, and i'm sure a paper mario boss was in it somewhere.
That fucker of a guard is still there?
I suspect Super payed him
''Loading the Justin.tv player in a frame that is not allowed.'' What does that mean?
7I didn't even buy the game, so I kinda got both for free :P
Blocking allows a certain amount of frames to go by before you have to push the A button. Countering is the same thing, but you're allowed to give dmage and not take any at the cost of not having a lot of frames to work with in terms of blocking, IIRC.
Oh god the punis look adoranle
lol that works I guess
*adorable
11,02DinkyDoo: You have to either use a non-Chrome browser or go to the link provided.
*damage
Oh.
I do like the game gives you the tattle info for anybosses you didnt use it on in the trash
Thats kinda nice I suppose
I actually filled out my tattle log. :$
I did too
it's a me! Mario!
7I got really happy when I realised that both Javik and Tali have black and gold coloured armour so I can colour-coordinate my entire squad.
lol SuperBrony64
Weegee!
Mah man!
Oh man, I LOVED Luigi's stories in this game. :D
we gotta find some princess
I dont know how good it would be but I would pay to play a Luigi side story of his adventure
and fuck zem
I actually bought all the books and read them. :D
Luigi's last partner is weird
You NEVER find anything like it in the game aside from him
The music in the train ride is FANTASTIC.
i cant read that fast
see why can't we have this instead
7it also /vaguely/ works with Garrus but not much
I want to make a pony crossing sign and replace the deer crossing sign along my road with it.
Is mario falling asleep during tales a running gag or something?
make it look real though haha.
Chesnut king.
PaperSpade[R], yes
If I recall he's only been caught once
PaperSpade[R]: It's supposed to bore him. :D
7SR, where do you fall on the idea that the whole 'next level of study' thing for Twilight is her becoming an alicorn?
I don't read that far into the series.
Is it just me or does Merlon's stache get more and more grand each game?
use shell
I have no idea. But I LOVE his moustache.
But if I did, I would say that ponies are born the way they are, and don't "transform".
Also I love how a majority of Mario's partners are chicks
Mario gets all the ladies
it seems like that's what they're trying to imply, but I don't see how they could do it
Did anyone ever use Chet Rippo's skills in this game? :D
I never did.
so I don't think she will "become" an alicorn, but its possible through some magic or something that she will become one temporarily.
i mustach the question
Twilight would be too overpowered as a main character
What does Chet do again?
7Twilight is already way too OP
for some sort of mission.
So they'd have to replace her with someone else or end the show
mario a pimp
PaperSpade[R]: He buffs one stat at the cost of lowering another, if I recall.
Maybe if we keep buying the merchandise they will keep making the show.
I gauge the cost of one episode to around $650,000
woo
What up with that Pain badge lol
Is the "Double Pain" badge ever useful?
o.o damn
Also is it a rumor or can you actually get stuck on the level up selection in the first paper game?
I've never found a use for it.
7also you're objecting to the concept of simply plonking wings on a creature - a unicorn no less - where the sun and moon are controlled by living deities. But only in certain parts of the world. and you doubt that there is a spell to turn permanently give a unicorn wings?
PaperSpade[R]: I actually hear you can.
and I suspect that SuperBrony64 isn't doing a BP run
Didn't you learn anything from magic duel?
Seinor stompy AWAY!
Such spells are impossible :P
stepped on wat
7That /Twilight/ has her limits.
RainbowDerpy: Contact lens.
oh
Bitch needs glasses
But really, we are debating a show where ponies talk.
just go get Rarity
so I suppose they can do whatever they want.
she must have some leftover contact lenses
but but, it was the _alicorn_ amulet
Mushroom RAGE
so maybe only alicorns can do that stuff
spy mouse
but true :P
see her mushroom rage
THIS MOUSE
does that dog thing ever have a species name?
7and impossible for her /so far/. She hasn't been studying that long - the Princesses have had a thousand years (at least) to fuck around and figure shit out.
Fund him
no really fund him
I don't think they actually laid out "groundwork" where rules exist for the ponyverse.
im just gunna say it GREEEEEEEEENNN!
FUND HIM EVERYTHING
SuperBrony64: Give him as MUCH moeny as you can.
whats possible and whats not.
12 oz mouse
He pays you double later
7well, we know that Celestia controls the sun and moon in Equestria, but not the everfree forest. which is kind of impressive in itself
that's actually pretty dangerous when writers do that
He just took all your money.
08,01☭
PaperSpade[R]: Triple, IIRC.
yeah
The fuck is that?
and yeah Triple
Is that a Hammer and Sickel?
in a little cartoon like this probably not so much
Yeah, it is.
Da fuq? XD
08,01is it a bird?
08,01is it a plane?
*and
13no
DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
COMMUNISM
13it's SCIEEEEEEEEEEEEENCE
I'm using lightIRC, so I see a garbled mess.
But I've seen shows where things get really weird because there are basically no rules in the universe
BETTER DEAD THAN RED
CrystalPhoenix: Admittingly one thing I didnt like about Sticker star is the fact they make the characters aware they're paper
13no you are a yellow commie
7It just amuses me that you object to the concept of turning Twi into an alicorn through magic when such insane magical feats are already cannon
Its almost like, the simpsons had a sort of rule where certain things could happen and make sense in their earlier seasons
I bet it was the second option.
13i am the pink commie
11,02SCIENCE
COMMUNISM HO!
but the later season, like season 19+, they broke anything they created.
its all suck.

Shizuka: Da fuck

AW SHIIII COUNTER
SuperBrony64: Nice counter! :D
11,02Shizuka: Haha
How high can you level up the stage?
that's definitely bad too
JUUUUUUUUUUMP!
I only leveled it up like twice
PaperSpade[R]: Pretty high, actually.
Mine had like blue curtans
I think up to 200+ people?

One of my favorite styles moves were the hammer moves.
Also one time I swore Luigi tossed a rock at me once
Only 1 bathroom and always at the opposite end of the campgrounds :D
Daww, so cute! <3
Don't eat meeeee!
I just recently finished watching the TV show Angel which basically has a universe where there are spells for pretty much everything
Why are the puni's so adorable?
Pikmin soon
7It concerns me that this is going to be a very Twi-centric season.
Although, the music gets somewhat annoying when you have to listen to it for about an hour and a half as a kid.
And every episode they bring up completely new lore
I don't mind twi episodes.
Mean Mario.
It keeps me entertained.
the second to last season got completely crazy because of that
SuperBrony64: You're mean :(
and everyone hated it
also, my plans got ruined
7Yeah, but every episode so far has had her solving the problem through magic. I want episodes that have her as background pony.
for the season finale i was going to rent that theatre
but im going to be away most of january
so wont work.
I've never really liked Twilight all that much
13oh this
She annoys me
13thousand year door?
I dont think you can get that badge till you have Flurry
13yep
The bad part of including such general "magic" themes is that your always like "just use ur magic lol fix that problem"
I forgot what it even does
kind of a cop-out
:P
11,02Shizuka: Love this game ^-^
Does anyone remember?
Yep
GREEEEEN!
CHAPTER 2
but whatever, I can enjoy the show for its pretty colours.
Gosh I miss that
Its like LSD or something.
:P
Which is probably why they don't include Celestia and Luna much
lol
11,02CHAPTER 2 - THE GREAT BOGGLY TREE
13the great googly moogly
11,02PaperSpade[R]: It decreases damage you take by 1 when you dodge
No silouete this time
11,02Shizuka: O U
Id like more Luna episodes.
Dat level style
google moogley googly moogly NOOOOOO googly moogly
who voiced Luna in the first episode?
so unique and yet eerie
i wonder who remembers that
Howdy everypony how are y'all
why am I thinking Lauren Faust?
mario got high
Aw shit
hoi AskPeachy|NFC
The environments are really diverse here
our favorite sisters tri.....duo?
Ahh Vivian...i liked her lol
BladedWings, her?
I was kind of disturbed to find out japan vivi is a DUDE
Apparently it was Tabitha St Germain, same person who does Rarity's voice
Lawl
ah k
13i think the last part of this i saw was the wrestling match in the air
13back when i had friends
Its just...WHY NINTENDO
All these voice actors live like 40 mins from me.
WHY A MALE
all in the unique charm of Paper Mario
Now that I think about it I can see that, they do sound similar
Kind of a funny thought :P
CrystalPhoenix: i thought the one with a red hat was a girl XD
11,02Shizuka: Glitz Pit
PaperSpade[R], why not?
13that was it
Well im confused why she was a male to begin with
I'm sure there are plenty of creepy stalker bronies who would love to live where you live then :P
haha
PaperSpade[R], that's her personal backstory
11,02Glitz Pit was one of my favorite Chapters from this game.
I kind of prefer Vivian to being a female because it creeps me out the way she acts in this game if she was a dude
Theres this guy who went from the east cost to DHX media in vancouver
which makes Vivian ever more interesting
Mustachieod.
SuperBrony64: I think it was everyone's favorite
but didnt have the balls to knock on the door.
he made a video, I loled.
I drive past DHX once or twice a month.
He made a video of being too afraid to knock on a door? XD
Well it was kind of jaring... getting used to Vivian as a girl liking her as a character and then finding out she was a dude in japan
yep lol well it was an office complex building with a buzzer, he didn't go say hi.
Kind of threw me for a loop
PaperSpade[R], you wouldn't like Poison from Street Fighter then
oh i love poision :D
or Bridget in Guilty Gears
Id bring cake or something, and if they didn't want it, id eat it there on the steps.
*Poison
MONCHROME!
haha
But id be sure to buy it from somewhere because no one wants someone's creepy home made stuff, thats just weird.
*Mono
Is there a pattern to the slot?
wait Bridget was a guy too...man i am learning everyday :D
BINGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
BladedWings, yep
Your FP is full!
I never played Guilty Gears
you didn't notice from the mugshot just before the battles?
Am I the only one who hates Clefts?
11,02Everyone hates Clefts
11,02They have way too much Defense
applebloom voice.
its bad that Poison was the only one i knew of :D and no CrystalPhoenix since i didnt play with that character much lol
small world.
CrystalPhoenix: daaaaaaw
So any bets on what color yoshi Super is gonna get?
I would wish for Blakc
Black**
cause that's the rarest I believe
Its like 20-21 i believe

When does the timer offfically stop for the yoshi color anyway?
/me sees hammer and sickle and swastika
God I am getting such a fucking nostalgia rush from this game
Oh here we go
/me grabs popcorn
7meh not really cbf for this
Did you know, if you took all the bronies in the USA and put them in canada, 1 in 3 people would be bronies.
7tired
Same here PaperSpade[R]
7This guy in my history basically came out as brony to me today. that was weird.
I kind got weirded out by FLurry first time I saw her
7hasn't seen any of season 2 yet
lol...
OH I have a story for you guys
The fact she has very obvious breasts in what I assume a kids game is odd
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7a89f9b0112c3f16dacec86041871f0d.png
sunday night I went down to the usa to pick some stuff up at harbour freight
I hate when people refer to it as "coming out"
so melodramatic
I was comingback, and was all like, I hope I wont have to pay taxes
CrystalPhoenix: Erm
becasue I had like $300 worth of chinese goods
My main character in Street Fighter mixed with best pony
and they charge you to bring it back but its still cheaper than buying in canada
perfect
so I had my rainbow dash hat on
How the fuck do you instal a electronic door in a TREE
coming through the border
WHERE ARE THE WIRES
the dude stops me
"whats the value of goods coming back?"
me "about $300"
Where the hell is the power coming from!
wireless door
him: "have a good night, rainbow dash."
woot no tax :P
power coming from nature
We must go inside Fluttertree
Fluttertree! HUZZAH!
PaperSpade[R]: probably the same way Twi has a library in a tree with a wood burning stove in the kitchen and a fire breathing dragon living there :)
Rainbow Dash: Too awesome for taxes
not sure if don't want be inside flutter...tree
Ots the Deku Tree!
Lets go kill Gohma
Its like a secret society.

It'sa Paper Mario
sometimes its better to just let him have his fun :P
COUNTER
I suppose so
What partner did you guys use all the time in this game?
LEVEL UP
I can't remember
I also got a brohoof from a home depot employee. dont know if I said that here before :P

SuperBrony64: Query; Who is best pony?
11,02xles: Me :3
^
all ponies are best ponies
SuperBrony64: Should've seen that one comin'. =P
11,02Seriously, Derpy is best poneh :3

#3: http://fav.me/d5mm1xo
Twilight is best pony
#2: http://fav.me/d5n05vp
SuperBrony64: Righto. Just curious, trying to figure out who to draw for tomorrow. ^^
Ponies47: all i see is " SuperBrony64 is best poneh"
and #1: http://fav.me/d5mzn80
:3
11,02xles: Derpeh :D
nice CrystalPhoenix
oh here's a better version for number 1 http://sta.sh/0257kxxbxcfm
11,02xles: Or you could draw meh :3c
SuperBrony64: Hehe, we'll see! The decision is usually 0.2 seconds before I set my pencil on the paper. =)
CrystalPhoenix: dat plot
Nah silly ponies. Navy Numbers is best pony http://i.imgur.com/X7UvE.png :3
Ponies47, that's not a wallpaper
DoshWithRonbows :3
11,02xles: For me, it usually changes depending on how I draw at the moment :P
SuperBrony64: I only draw one way - badly. ;)
Ponies47: i wish i had awesome drawing skill as youh ;3;
CrystalPhoenix, :p
Maplehoof is a best pony
xles, you don't draw badly
you draw your way
i think he was implying something
I do not remember gameboys being that big
with the whole " ;)"
CrystalPhoenix: Exactly!
probably not old enough.
is there some kind of thing attached to it or something?
positive thinking
I actually did have an original gameboy
positive force
My uncle found it in his photography studio and just gave it to us
its like some kind of light
Oh poppycock. I know where my skill lies. And I try to improve on them so that I wont suck as much tomorrow as I do today. Best mindset, for me. Constant search for improvement. *nod*
or maybe a battery pack
Are we doing the "X is best pony" thing with OCs again?
and then my dad smashed it with a hammer
AssaultWithEmbraces: i think so?
Not sure
/)*(\ - my OC from back
I think I use to have that
I dont have an OC, but i dont feel like making one
11,02brb
atm
I have a Mario game from 1989 that came with it
Lost all the other games though
You know what, I have that game boy light boxed :P
I'm sure of it, ill have to find it
hiv
thelonepony, same, but too lazy :$
SuperBrony64: I can poke you in my daily sketch tweet if I end up drawing miss derp if you'd like.
lol
AdamTheDuck: wait, i thought that pic was yo... nevermind :$
your dad smashed it...
11,02xles: That would be awesome~
11,02But Tweet me anyway no matter what you draw :)
I have been threatened so many times to have my computers smashed with hammers.
thelonepony, nah it's Gold_Demona's :P
why?
haha...I'm sure I have too
But now the joke's on him, I claim computers as a company expense and pay with the company card.
AdamTheDuck: really? it was cute :3
SuperBrony64: Hehe, drew rainbow dash as a sled dog...pony, today. =P
was it disipline back then?
11,02xles: Cool :3
Well, sketched, rather.
My dad always just took away my stuff though
my dad never smashed any of my stuff.
He claims he smashed the gameboy because it was broken
he just threatened to do it.
sh
ah
thelonepony, ikr, that's why I think socks are adorable :$
but really there were just a couple lines through the screen
we have a pretty good relationship now though, so its all good.
11,02xles: Nice :D
:3
TRIXIE:|
So my brother and I make fun of him and say he smashed it because he was getting too addicted to Tetris
thats good
She's NOT pleased with the situation. ;)
wow 3:15 am really time to go to bed
hi DarkRainbow
Remember the Tetris commercial?
also lol.. we are doing a gift exchange with our family
and I have an uncle Brad
for mah
on the list of who buys for who
Hello
There are two brads and no one knows which one is which
so we dont know who we are buying for.
There was a Tetris commercial?
I dont think they thought that through before they sent the email out with the list of names....
I'm probably too young for that one
Hi DarkRainbow
how've you been DarkRainbow
Hello DarkRainbow
I dislike video game commercials.
We have a few people in my family with the same names like that
Big Michael and little Michael
HI DarkRainbow
lol
......
I'm 21
is this the first paper mario?
My Brothers name is Michael and my other uncle's name is Michael.
Hi
hi
11,02Second one Rose`Brokenstem
;o
O
SuperBrony64, halp! i got broked at Combatives today
Oh here we go!
:[
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZV9IlTJcIg Now before you laugh, remember its 1985
Meh
haha, yeah that was way before my time
hi Rose`Brokenstem ...why Broken?
Shouldent SB be at higher health at this point?
wankers knocked me out 7 times, and dislocated 3 joints
but i gave more than i got
SuperBrony64 the one with the nerd who wnats to marry peach
Rose`Brokenstem, :/
broke a guys nose today because people kept underestimating the small white girl
I didn't even start watching TV with commercials until probably like 1999
also, dislocated 5 sholders
oh
and knocked out 10 people
Rose`Brokenstem, hope they got what they deserve :P
but im hurting
The commercials from when I was like 10 years old on the cartoon channels are the same commercials they play today.
haha that's awesome
Some video game commercials were real awesome
:3
For example, the Yop commercials
Dis slideshow.
do you guys get the Yop commercials?
Is SuperBrony64 doing a low hp run or something?
uhhhh
Yop as in that penguin PC game?
:O
I played that
Yop as in the yougurt drinkl
I'm not familar with it
yogurt
Because no offense but I usualy have at least 15/20 at this point
Oh lol
maybe its just a canadian product.
offense taken!
ow
hay everypony why is episode 8 and 9 on the same day
im too hurt to be falsly indignant
They have been using the same commercial for as long as I can remember.
What does a fence have to do with this game?
ONO
I remember having this computer game YOP for "Your Own Penguin"
I have no idea where it even came from or anything
In school, did you ever have Dino Park Tycoon game
No
I had Roller Coaster Tycoon at home though
I remember that game
And Zoo Tycoon had a dinosaur expansion
Roller coaster tycoon 1 was the best.,
it still is the best.
wow is that book a pokedex
somewhat close to one
Hey, all.
Hi DocSane
Problem with the stream?
One thing I like about Door over the first is the partners no longer get fucking stunned
Hello DocSane
Nope just go ot the link in the embeded
I hated that in the first Paper mario
are you guys still talking about paper mario?
The games I played in school were all educational
I tried installing it again recently and for some reason it couldn't remember the stuff I'd unlocked =/
But they were actually fun
Ah...
whats up with twitch not working here
Bronysith: Well Super is freaking streaming it
11,02Bronysith: Probably cause I'm playing it :P
Is there much point to a stream that can only run in a separate tab?
every time I quit the game it lost all memory of unlocked parks
someone needs to adapt roller coaster tycoon 1 into a browser based game'
So even if I had a save with one of them it wouldn't let me play on it
I mean, I just tossed it to a second monitor, but what about everyone else?
that would be awesome
11,02You can view it in the embed if you're not using Chrome.
DocSane, I use an IRC client
Wait... how is twitch working on out site?
Oh... And I'm using Chrome.
port it to html5 and javascriuopt.
well you cant really port it
but you can recreate it.
I thought Twitch never worked on this
wouldnt be easy though
I read that the guy made the game mostly in assembly
I would die
Wonder why Chrome isn't working for this.
Style~
11,02Twitch is weird like that
yeah
wb AJIsHaunter :)
and by himself
mostly assembly, I think the sound drivers and stuff like that was C
yeah
sawyer
I remember just putting down the controller and just listening to the music as you traverse this area. :)
very talented programmer.
Also, thanks, thelonepony. :)
asm looks daunting, but its actually quite logical.
Welcome back AJIsHaunter :)
Thanks, MLP_Brovakiin. :)
if you want to half ass it, just use a lot of winapi calls :P
I've done some MIPS for one of my classes
Never again
SuperBrony64: Have you been leveling up at all? You seem kinda low on health for this point..may just be me
wb AJIsHaunter :)
....is SB being stalked by a Pikmin?
Thank you, BladedWings. :)
you can pretty much make apps in asm using api calls commonly used in visual basic
11,02CriticKitten: Lol, that's a Puni :P
but its kind of cheating.
So a Pikmin?
what did you make?
11,02PaperSpade[R]: I'm going for mainly BP in my Level Ups
MIPS is embedded programming isnt it
That seems a bti risky
Really really simple stuff
/me wants to nom on BladedWings wings right now, but is afraid to get cut
PaperSpade[R], you should ONLY level BP
/me does it anyway :3c
thelonepony: Then don't do it? :D
Just basic array manipulation and stuff
I always go health, fp bp
PaperSpade[R], BP run, have you heard of it?
In that order
/me gives thelonepony a muffin to nom on
I love up all the stats in order until they reach a certain amount.
I think it was
Cant some bosses hit for more than 10 in a single attack?
After 50 in both HP and FP, I switch to BP and just focus on that.
/me noms on BladedWings instead :3c
PaperSpade[R]: I think the final can.
11,02PaperSpade[R]: Yes
PaperSpade[R], HP+ FP+ Badges
I actually took that class twice because I didn't like my grade
o.o SuperBrony64 playing TTYD :$
Thats why i just think this is risky to me, I never really played like this
Goodnight everyone :)
PaperSpade[R], but it's FUUUUUN
I stopped using those badges, since they took up too much BP for me.
nite MLP_Brovakiin
also ello everypony :)
Night MLP_Brovakiin :)
11,02Night MLP_Brovakiin :)
night MLP_Brovakiin
AJIsHaunter, it's only really good if you do a BP run
and you end up godly in BP run at the end
We did stuff with memory locations and caches; that was what really killed me
Oh no, not this scene. :D
hm
NOT THIS SCENE.
Aw shit
I don't even remember most of it now :P
im to OP in TTYD :>
Run, Mario.
How did nintendo let this slide?
Just.....run.....
I dont get it
hhaawww mmmaaayyyyyy

Flurry is best black sassy woman ghost
Dat DIzzy Puni
Mario is Pimp
:D
Mario gets all the ladies
:I
whats wrong shub?
WHat makes mario so atractive to the women?
Is it the stache?
dat jaymoo still asleep?
PaperSpade[R]: Probably that SWEET 'stache.
PaperSpade[R] just ninja'd me :I
Probably
PaperSpade[R], definitely the stache
Cus its the first of May, First of May
outdoor fuckin starts today
the stache is a stat in Mario and Luigi after all
The way he's positioned when she uses her wind, is Mario......or am I overrthinking
um SuperBrony64 why is ur max life 10?
AssaultWithEmbraces: I had a feeling like that as a kid.
ah
AJIsHaunter: mmm
SuperBrony64, you should only upgrade BP
dem BP
15...good god
I could never tell what Mario was grabbing as a kid. :D

PaperSpade[R], better question: WHY on earth would someone make something like that?
Bronysith: KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!!!
SuperBrony64, had a jolly good time playing yet another instalment of the famous nintendo mascot.

Just curious am I the only one here who kind of finds the whole coin gimmick of NSMB 2 stupid?
He's focusing quite intesnely while playing it until
i agree
so many bad pony OCs
PaperSpade[R]: It's only really good for things such as coin rush, IMO.
out of the blue while he was about to do his last hit on the koopaling
god
Bronysith: that OC Dante is SICK!
if you make a pony OC, DONT GIVE IT A BACKGROUND
EVER
The fact they use the coin thing as a selling point seems lazy
no story, it only makes it worse, no matter what
Coins are in every mario game, LETS MAKE A GIMMICK OUT OF IT
a racecar came out from the side with an odd looking man yelling out
/me slaps Bronysith for the last link
TURBOTASTIC
/me takes AssaultWithEmbraces to bed
im prett sure those are troll OC's
Can I get warm chocolate milk and a bedtime story? :3
that last one's cutie mark is a standard windows wallpaper i think
twixie_sprinkle: That's also somehting to consider.
twixie_sprinkle, yes it is
So is the new power called Squirrel mario?
twixie_sprinkle: ya it is lawl
i dont know, there are some idiots out there who spend lots of money on shit pony art
so i would think its just troll OC's
PaperSpade[R]: Squirrel suit, I think.
CrystalPhoenix love that movie
Irish_Pony, of course
twixie_sprinkle, ^
i was actually going to make a troll OC myself, but never got around to it
Also I love how bowser does the reverse of what he usualy does in this game
Instead of kidnapping the princess he throws mario and co out
If I everr make a troll OC, I will make sure your eye will BURN frrom the color alone
well, i already have my uber awesome OC already though
hello.
Genius
Bronysith: You weren't here a couple days ago, weren't you?
hi Firelight
hoi Firelight
if I ever make myself a legit OC
Hi, Firelight. :)
it'll be a phoenix
ohai Firelight
CrystalPhoenix: ya dont say
cause I'm hipster like that
OH HAI BOOM BOOM
ugh.. I know I got on but i will be right back.
You useless sack of crap

He's like the Leomon of the koopas
Well hell that was easy ^_^

God boom boom you are pathetic
Bronysith: i stop liking her 1.5 seasons ago
that guy had raditz's power level
SO what world is this? 4?
Bronysith: Also, on the story bit you were going on about, I don't mind a story behind one as long as it doesn't make them a terrible OC or a Mary Sue.
*stopped
CrystalPhoenix: May I ask where the "Turbo-Tastic" bit ame from?
*came
AJIsHaunter: doesnt matter, make a background or a story for an OC and it will be mary sue
AJIsHaunter: or a gary stue
SuperBrony64: What world is this? 4?
Bronysith: And now you're just making assumptions.
SpadeKyurem[R]: Two, I think.
AJIsHaunter: Wreck It Ralph
J_E_Smith71: ?
11,02SpadeKyurem[R]: Yeah
Ah, nvm then SpadeKyurem[R] .
AJIsHaunter, Wrek it ralph of course
anyway gotta go
The fact World one has a shortcut to world 4 i think is silly
AJIsHaunter: You asked Phoenix where the "TurboTastic" bit came from, which was Wreck It Ralph
its funny how many gifs there are of soccer players faking it, the sport's become somewhat of a laughing stock
J_E_Smith71: Oh........
TO ART I GO
bai [1]CrystalPheonix
Bye CrystalPhoenix
bye CrystalPhoenix
crap i spelled the username wrong...
So much appluase in this game. :D
Bye CrystalPhoenix
The hell was the applause for?
*applause
SpadeKyurem[R]: I have no idea, it didn't really change the gameplay for me.
I dont get what their applauding him fore
*for
I'm guessing it's supposed to congratulate you on doing certain things?
SpadeKyurem[R]: It does that in the NSMB games sometimes, such as getting all Star Coins and stuff
So...not achivements
Well I didnt mind it for star coins but he just gets coins and they applaud
its odd
I take back what I said about this game being all the same as the the classics. It HAS been improved.
YOU CLEVER BITCH LEVEL
I hate it when ghost houses/ships pull that shit
bye guys! :)
bye coinflip2
My favorite world in NSMB Wii is 8. The levels had some awesome music
Bye coinflip2
bye coinflip2
I think the game looks very interesting, but one of the gripes I have with it is that it recycled music from NSMB Wii instead of making different music. Then again, that's just m.
*me
Bye, coinflip2. :)
Does this game have that over world encounter like NSMB wii had?
Yep
YOU ATE YOSHI
Yoshiception!
YOSHI! NO!
You tratious swine
Nope
Yoshi holding a baby of his own kind in his mouth.
*traitorous
yoshi's mouth is like a kangaroo's pouch
... except sometimes things don't come out
yoshi and kirby are the two most incredibly evil things ever
Anyone remember omnishells?
SpadeKyurem[R]: ?
The rainbow shells from world
Bronysith: It's mainly because they're mainly simplistic creatures.
Gah, why do I use words twice sometimes? :S
AJIsHaunter: or the fact that yoshi throws his/her unborn children as weapons
sup
I find that betrayle pic hilarious
AJIsHaunter: i know tjat feel
that*
or that kirby eats entire buildings, swallowing their souls and taking their powers
Bronysith: What if there's a process in which one egg is a child and the other is an object used for throwing?
Bronysith: Dont forget he went on a mass slaughter over fucking cake
Remember to always be yourself, unless you can be Batman. Always be Batman.
amen
SpadeKyurem[R]: this is why they are evil
Bronysith: not every chicken egg will become a chicken if left alone
Someone stole my cake? Time to kill everything
Like I said, Kirby's a mainly simplistic creature. He's not exactly the most sentient being on the planet.
fail
kirby is evil
But I see what you're getting at.
AJIsHaunter: He's pretty much a kid
how unfortunate
That fail
That didn't work
kirby and yoshi are evil
SpadeKyurem[R]: Pretty much. A kid who doesn't really have a complex establishment of morals.
I assume Meta Knight is kirby except with morals and compex thought
I'm pretty sure how yoshi interacts with the donut platforms on this is significantly evil
Plus, Kirby was woken up prematurely. He's not supposed to be that way.
NOPE
YOSHI NOO
dun dun dun dun dun dun DUUUN
At least Chargin Chuck isnt in this game
NOPE
nuuuuu

THE EVIL FISH
Really? Super guide?
13http://i.imgur.com/fMFCH.jpg
Doesnt thatr ruin your ranking forever if that ever shows up in Wii?
HA
Shizuka: HA
denied
Would I consider Yoshi and Kirby to be evil? No. Incredibly simplistic, Maybe.
Kirby is demonic
SpadeKyurem[R]: yeah I believe if you EVER even SEE it you lose something in the Wii version
he will swallow your soul
also, Miiverse prompts: wut?
11,02lol Shizuka
you saw what he did to marx
lol Shizuka
NullRadix, I agree.
that poor bastard never stood a chacne
I still find it weird Kirby goes on a fucking rampage over CAKE
SpadeKyurem[R]: No, if you let the Super Guide take over a level, it would ruin your ranking.
AJIsHaunter: Actually i think if it even shows up your ranking is ruined
some freedoms even Uncle sam cannot appropriate
Buytoast: MURICA
It would only allow you to have three stars instead of three glistening stars.
So what's that green '!' box for?
These damn fish are from hell
AJIsHaunter: That still kind of ruins your rank
Kandarihu: super guide. The game plays itself so you can continue the game isntead of stuck forever
Kandarihu: It's an option that allows the Super Guide to take over for the rest f the level.
Kandarihu: If you fail hard enough on a stage it takes over
goddamn this background music has more BAAs than a sheep farm
So its a You suck let a pro handle it button
NOPE
oh god
FAIL
id be PISSED
YOU TRATOROUS SWINE
Oh, like in Donkey Kong Country Returns?
Kandarihu: Yep.
although *sometimes* the game is actually JUST hard enough or hiding things well enough
now tell me
donkety kong coutnry returns
darned... ghost houses...
are the kremlings in it
please say yes
Buytoast: Nope.
WHAT
HORSESHIT
what does he fight then?
Regardless if they were, I had PLENTY of fun with the game.
fail
Buytoast: Demonic Tiki creatures, if I recall.
giant mutant bananas or soemthing?
tiki creatures?
Buytoast: He fights evil Tiki
he aint crash bandicoot
I swear. I wish there were demand for parental controls to disable Super Guide modes.
SuperBrony64: http://turboultra.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/betrayal1.jpg
some backwards shit right there
Buytoast: You'd have to look it up. It's hard to describe.
Kandarihu, why?
You traitorous swine
bah, i'd rather go and play donkey kong country 2 on me grandma's SNES
at least it has kremlings
Can't be swine if they're fish, SpadeKyurem[R]
Buytoast: You fight these guys: http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110310143147/mario/de/images/e/ed/DKCR_Artwork_Tiki_Tak_Stamm.png
I enjoyed the game, regardless of the enemy change.
So why was K Rool missing in Returns?
SpadeKyurem[R]: I'm guessing he got tired of losing?
hell, i'd pay money out the ass if k rool was in the next smash bros
That and people were tired of seeing the Kremlings in the previous DK installments?
now there's a bad ass that'll whoop you to next week
Maybe K rool finally croaked
FAILURE
NOOOO
11,02I PUT MAH PANTS ON BY MAHSELF THIS MORNING
I'm seeing an increased backlash against a percieved culture of "participation trophies" in which children are no longer challenged to play to be #1.
Read the FAILURE in the SmashBros Announcer voice
DING DING
Kandarihu: I hate the everyone is a winner shit
There's winners and losers deal with it
Seeing how he's failed time and time again against the DK crew.
b-b-but it's mean to call our wittle babies losers!
I doubt he'd want to fight them again.
Everyone is a winner, except those who suck
TRAITOR!

Either that or something went wrong on SB's side.

Yeah, it's warm for me here. I hope we'll get some rain soon. :<
SC gets some warm winters
AssaultWithEmbraces: where in sc?

cratorkid: I'm in Columbia
what is this?
i would give hellsing a good soild. eh it was ok
AJIsHaunter: not bad, wish it snowed right now ;^;
SuperBrony64: I might be wrong, but the concept was used in NSMB for the DS.
AssaultWithEmbraces: ahhh im not near you
snowing*
thelonepony: I wish it would snow here too. :D
Where are you cratorkid ?
damn. me and my grammer :P

BladedWings: what bout you?
cratorkid: Georgetown ^_^
Rock Hill, that's like an hour from me. You might as well say NC cause you're right on the border
AssaultWithEmbraces: yeah, like 30 min from charlotte
cratorkid, BladedWings: We need to get Nittany_Discord (since he lives in Rock Hill too) and the 4 of us should have like, a BState meetup someplace
AssaultWithEmbraces: yeeeees ^_^ and i didnt know Nittany_Discord lived in SC as well :O
OH SHIT THAT SOUND
im actualy surprised by the amount of bronys down here in sc, yeah, i talked about that with nitt in just before school started
I would love to do a meetup, justj have to know when ^_^

im sure we can set up a meetup, with a bunch of others from around the state too
D:
13why would you want to meet people?
cratorkid: awesoooooome ^_^
Shizuka: why not? ^_^
Shizuka: ?
cratorkid, we have a lot down here. Thing is this is part of the almight Bible Belt and the southerners don't really "approve" of grown men watching a show about pastel ponies
they'd be ok with you though AssaultWithEmbraces ^_^
Princecess Celestia is a pagan god!
?
EVIL
BladedWings: But then I'd get the "Aren't you too old to be watching My Little Pony?" question.
Better than "You are a guy watching MLP so you must be gay" shtick
Aren't you too old to watch My little pony, AssaultWithEmbraces?
AssaultWithEmbraces: nods* in the north even alot of my friends where intolerable about it, but its k so long as i dont shove it down their throats, which some do
DashWithRainbows: Nope
cratorkid: same
Then you must be a young girl
Ha
the shove down throats part i mean cratorkid :$
DashWithRainbows: Will be 21 in January, dea

HYPER MARIO

<
THE STAR
:<
cant wait to look back on Dec. 21
AssaultWithEmbraces: Take Nabbit, for example. I was thinking of "Dang it, it's Nabbit again" when I saw him. Then I thought of another approach. Dang. Nabbit. Combined the two into a pun. :D
IT WAS RIGHT THERE
RoboGerbil: why?
AJIsHaunter: wouldnt it be dag nabbit?
BladedWings we can have a good lol at those who thought i was going to happen.
AJIsHaunter, I saw what you did there. My timing and originality forr puns are horrible
:D
BladedWings: That too, but I wanted to suit the mood since the name is Nabbit. :D
AssaultWithEmbraces: Like when he kept getting crushed by the blocks is how i thought the level was "crushing" him ^_^
Plus, I always saw it as "Dang Nabbit" instead of "Dag nabbit" as a kid. :P
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6re0nYi6R1rzn06do2_500.jpg toast :3
This is verry punny
AJIsHaunter: i always heard it as dag nabbit but to each his own ^_^
BladedWings: I guess this level's got a bit of a CRUSH on SB, don't you think? :3
it wants him
AJIsHaunter: Its almost, dare i say, smashing?
SMASHING! BLARARGARGH
i see what you did there.....
BladedWings: And heart-POUNDING...
ayejay, leave the puns to the me, the druggie of buns
:>
SuperBrony64: I think you need the Squirrel Suit. :<
not sure what i just said
It breaks my heart
Yes, I get it guys. I can't make a joke. No need to mock me XD
11,02AJIsHaunter: ikr :<

/me pokes thelonepony back :3
nooo
You can do it SB!
thelonepony: thats actually fairly common, because mac doesnt run many programs
well im gonna read a fic see u guys during my next free time.
thelonepony: so peope have to install windows on it
twixie_sprinkle: wait, really?
wow
the more you know
these days there is almost zero hardware difference between the two so yeah...
...
basically the case and the keyboard
thelonepony: well i mean mac doesnt run many programs that people might need
because most programs are .exe
ah
macs dont run .exe, so people have install windows on it, which costs more money
so often you have to buy the mac+windows
and macs are already overpriced
ah i see
Toad
's scamming
11,02lol
I have NO idea why, but I love this world's music especially. I'm guessing because it's peaceful. :D
actually jcelios
jcelios: mac doesnt run many autoCAD programs
and those are commonly used
Also, here's my favorite Koopaling out of all of them.
why are you telling me this? lol
hey everypony!
hi StuffCrusader
jcelios: well i just noticed you said theres not much difference between mac and windows
Hi, StuffCrusader. :)
Hi StuffCrusader

StuffCrusader: It's a Koopaling, if I recall.

AJIsHaunter: which voice again?
BladedWings, Ludwig
11,02Let's do dis o-o

Oh. I thought he completely removed the area when the hand landed.

The stream derped a bit there
/join #RPforall or #Epic-rp
Bowwwwseeer PAWNCH
Natalie: No advertising, please. :)
wat did he do to peach this time?

/me gives Derpy_Derp a muffin
Derpy_Derp: Nice! :)
StuffCrusader, that might not be serious enough to have it checked out then. I suggest calling a vet before you actually take him in.
Derpy_Derp: that sounds cool ^_^

Hope it goes well Derpy_Derp
eww, some of his fur is stuck to the scab

For some reason I always wished that the Fireball powerup had a charge function that would let you charge up a large ball of fire.

jcelios: Like that, sort of.
that's what you get for building a flyin' machiens
DANGNABBIT
This one cat of mine is just bugging me like crazy.

WOW.
HOW

man peach sure has one heck of a castle
Already at the final stage?
SpadeKyurem[R]: That's why he has the Koopalings. To hold off Mario so he can import said lava and moat
OH NO. Not this levels.......
*these
It's especially hard for people trying to get Star Coins.
The music to this level <3

/me dies of bleeding ;^;

The pipe, SB! THE PIIIPE!
/me will not need his feet in the next life ;^;
AssaultWithEmbraces, I don't think he can get the last big coin and the pipe in the same run
Kandarihu: I don't think so eithe but it's possible somehow.
AssaultWithEmbraces: I think the pipe warps you back to any world you completed.
AJIsHaunter: Really?
AssaultWithEmbraces: Yep. Think so.
AJIsHaunter, I meant the one in the level. I thought it leads you to some secret exit that will take you to the next level
no AJIsHaunter i think she meant the pipe in the level no that pipe right there lol
OH, the one in the LEVEL. :D
Then nevemind me, then. :$
*nevermind
AssaultWithEmbraces: yay i knew what you meant ^_^

Where did bowser get the funding to do all of this shit?
pretty much SpadeKyurem[R]
hey AJIsHaunter, why'd you change your name?
SpadeKyurem[R], we have no idea
because teens want sex and born runts.
:3
RDash5000: FOr the Pokemon pun. :D
AJIsHaunter: i see. carry on
Maybe it was already a lava world before he moved in and he wanted in on some of that prime real estate
/me attacks AJIsHaunter D:<
I changed mine to this because I like it better than my old one
D:
noPUNintendo
is it weird that i hate kids?
/me attacks are useless :<
RDash5000: No. I know people who hate kids.
So was Peach's castle built over a fucking volcano?
my friend has a level 100 magickarp. i shit you not

SpadeKyurem[R]: Nope. Prime real esate. Plus "Me big, Mario puny. He can't beat my lava!"
thelonecubone: I see what you did there. :D
thelonecubone: thank you. i feel better about myself now
you did <_<
lol so legendary :3
AssaultWithEmbraces: eeyup
You would think Bowser would be adversive to lava given how many times he burned to death in it
damn that thing is really crying now
Suicune_Toku_Brony: whu not toarkol D:
why*
So Bowser's like the Heat Meiser. Wherever he lives turns to a volcanic wasteland.
http://derpibooru.org/172884
I believe this is the part where Mario goes "Shit shit shit!" at the lava
AssaultWithEmbraces: sounds about right XD
thelonecubone: :D
thelonecubone: i remembered Suicune >~< and it was one of the pokemon in Gold/Silver i liked :D wish i played Daimond/Pearl 6_9
i love suicune
OH god this is scaring me
Sheesh, that sounds PAINFUL.
Suicune_Toku_Brony: wait, Suicune is in Daimond/pearl D:
le gasp
i never knew that D:
just seeing mario getting shocked :S
BladedWings: I know, right?
thelonecubone: i think only if you transfer it like other legendaries :S
Ah! An SB stream! :3
New cause of Mario's death: electroocution

jcelios has the right idea.
There is a point to it.
StuffCrusader: To have more descendants?
oh yeah is MAREio time! :D
i guess
oh, and to awnser a question you made a very long ago
11,02The Final Battle
and i mean a very long time ago
FUCK OFF JR
That's better. Hello everypony!
Hi, Canadian_Brony. :)
Let's do this!
Ello Canadian_Brony
oooooh,the final battle :o
LEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY!
ESSSBEEEESIXFOOOOUR
JEEEEEEENNNKKKIIIIINSSSS!
And there are Star Coins to get as well? :O

AJIsHaunter: this is where i got that gif with the demonic cosby and the gamecube gif http://derpibooru.org/153371
AJIsHaunter yeah
Buuurrrnnnn
He trollin
hi Canadian_Brony
AJIsHaunter: look throygh the comment section
Suicune_Toku_Brony: Yes. :D
through*
ow
Hi Canadian_Brony :)
Is really the final battle? There's not another last minute castle?
SuperBrony64: Could you maybe the try the P-Mushrooms? Do those give unlimited flight like the P-Wings? Maybe you could just fly over him
J_E_Smith71: This is Bowser, so there might and there might not be
11,02J_E_Smith71: They give you unlimited float-ups
That's not ominous
dat door
.....
dun dun dun
That door.
08,01oh god, bronystate
08,01oh god
Of course, Bowser gets the fancy doors
I was thinking about getting this game when I get a Wii U, but if SB can get 99 lives by the time he reaches the final boss, chances are I'd rack up lives faster than Super Mario 3D Land.
oh look what time it it ^_^
duuuuun duuuuuun duuuun..
/me plays a zelda theme
does...... does he have 97 lives?
yup
the_real_pony_1604: Yep.
....really? XD
BOWSAH
the_real_pony_1604 yes, this game BS's lives like 3D Land.
lol original last battle
THE AXE
BOWZA!!
THE AXE
lol, yep
Skele Bowser?
awww
well that worked lol
Bowser. WHY would you have that axe and switch there?
He just suddenly left
That was easy
.........
No way is it going to end with that
my favotite battles are races.
HERE WE GO AGAIN
oh dear
Now make my monster GROW *MMPR theme* :D
*yeah pegasus* YEAH!!!
OH NO.
uh on
*oh
I hated that wizard in Yoshis Island...
OOOOOOOOH NO.
Suicune_Toku_Brony: :D yes
waita tick
OH COME ON!!!!!
I can outrun even RD in my GTR
NocturnalBlade: We needs Elements of Harmony NOW :D
peach can go die in a hole!
ITS A TRAP
OGOD
Is this going to be any different than the NSMB Wii final giant Bowser thing?
O_O
Peach never seems to cry for help when she's kidnapped
well then...
..........
HOLY MEGA BOWZER!
We're fucked.
Oh that's just not fair
so anti climactic
This fight proves that graphics in this game are FANTASTIC.
You died...to the mook
Suicune_Toku_Brony: *sends out the Elements as Megazords lol
95 LIVES LATER...:D
*
Especially Bowser's model.
and they through him out of the castle screamign NO SOUP FOR YOU, COME BACK TWO YEAR
lol
NocturnalBlade: FRIENDSHIP ZORD ACTIVATED :D oh god this so oatmeal
J_E_Smith71 slightly, it seems. I find it kinda funny how I had more trouble getting to Bowser than defeating him (twice)
ded
Suicune_Toku_Brony: i love it :D
mario vs. albert wesker. begin!
NocturnalBlade: i remember seeing someone made a concept for Ponigers with Dash as Pony Blue :D
SpadeKyurem[R]: Now you know why Bowser likes lava. In the chance that Mario gets to him, he just takes a quick dip and he's mega.
"Alright men, we need an original final boss!" *something original* -__-
Seems you can't one shot Bowser either, in NSMB 2 you can just Gold Flower him, and in the first NSMB if you had a Mega Mushroom instant death
ಠ_ಠ
*Giant Bowser* :O
Q: Where do you live? A: Earth.
Suicune_Toku_Brony: lol nice, would love to see it
OH GOD
...............
WHAT.
WHY
OP
How are you supposed to kill this guy normally?
HE MAD
NERF! NOW!
SpadeKyurem[R] wait it out probably.
SpadeKyurem[R]: I think it has something to do with Baby Bowser.

SuperBrony64 dude, I've seen a better Bowser boss from the Mario Party story modes.
HEY, he at least deserves a mouth kiss at least ;_;
How the fuck did they get rid of the lava so fast?
Awww, there goes the real estate
Now all the Koopas will have mario masks?
fireball it!
After all the crap he's been through.
SpadeKyurem[R], magical lack of ontological inertia
And that's how they all died
crash 'n burn
SpadeKyurem[R]: I guess killing Bowser just drains the lava however that works
LadyCanary, he deserve more than that imo.

Do the toads feel pain when Mario jumps on them?
seeya StuffCrusader
Bye StuffCrusader
AssaultWithEmbraces: pssssh. pain
AssaultWithEmbraces: I think their heads are shock absorbers? :D
bye StuffCrusader
lots and lots of people
AJIsHaunter, but wouldn't it hurt anyways? Those are just the hats. Suppose one of them jumps a little *too* hard?
Their head might get crushed.
Mario is so greedy bouncing off their heads and possibly killing them for some stupid coincs
*coins
What is Mushrooms are decapitated Toad heads?
they are *shiny* coins
AssaultWithEmbraces: they seem happy with it lol

Congratulations, SuperBrony64

Nice playthrough, SuperBrony64. :)
Congrats, SB~
Congratulations SB84 :3
yay sb
congrats sb
yay :)
SuperBrony64: Course now you get all the Star Coins and I bet there's some secret world now
IMO Galaxy 3 would've been a better launch title. You have a revolutionary controller, so the launch titles should showcase it's abilities. NSMB is a 2D sidescroller. That's very limited. The gamepad being a secondary screen is convenient, but you don't really /do/ anything with it.
And don't get me started on the music...
The gamepad enables Boost Mode in multiplayer.
Anyhoo, back to playing Sticker Star
Huzzah
Or as I prefer to call it, Troll Mode
Beats the hell out of NSMB2 *shudders*
Galaxy has a FUCKING ORCHESTRA!!!
man 2BFs Play NSMB U was hilarious :D
The fuck is boost mode?
twixie_sprinkle: http://derpibooru.org/172389
SM3DL has original and catchy music
And I STILL need to beat Kid Icarus Uprising's Boss Rush on HARD mode. *shudders*
It's like normal mode, except that the gamepad player can create platforms for the players and other stuff
CriticKitten: So NSMB Wii trolling up to eleven?
thelonecubone: not bad, although im not a fan of ponies with guns
And I have to admit it IS kinda cool, but it's MAJOR troll material
SpadeKyurem[R] think of NSMB Wii, 4 player mode, where everyone is throwing each other into danger. Now, imagine that with a 5th player making platforms appear out of thin air.
Multiplayer mario isnt co-op
Because the gamepad person can put platforms in your way to spite you
its chaos
XD
It made for an awesome episode of Two Best Friends.
SpadeKyurem[R] "Chaos awaits. Bring friends." (Borderlands 2)
CriticKitten: yes it did :D
(Also applies to NSMB Wii/U)
twixie_sprinkle: ah, i see
So 4 player is less co=op and more dickery?
"My job is to screw you all with my Platforms of Destiny!"
SpadeKyurem[R]: you could say that
I don't understand how Mario Party games are described as the games that friendships are lost overr
You can be really dickish to each other
It has the potential to be a really great party game.
Really dickish
SpadeKyurem[R] implying anyone co-operated in 4p
But if you want, it can also have the potential to end friendships
Then again, I've never played a Mario Party game because I never had a Gamecube
or an n64?
i thought that was Monopoly's job :D
Watch Pokecapn's mario party lps
NocturnalBlade: nope
It shows you how bad it gets
^
:O
what?
Mario Party was the original CoD. A new MP every year or 2.
also, I just finished Two Best Friends Play Heavy Rain today
:O
Tovler: :D
I hated Mario party 1
SuperBrony64 SpadeKyurem[R]: An example of trolling someone with the Gamepad: http://cdn.brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comics/2012-11-30-451-HintsfromtheMiiverse.jpg
My hand
AssaultWithEmbraces get a Gamecube, buy 4 controllers for it, buy a memory card, buy ALL the Mario Parties for it, grab 3 friends (7 for MP7) and PLAY IT AAALLLLLL NIIIIIGGGHHHT!!!!!
SpadeKyurem[R]: I LOVED MP1.
J_E_Smith71: :D
Fuck the control stick minigames
11,02J_E_Smith71: LOL
Canadian_Brony: The majority of my friends live about from 1 to 3 hous from me
J_E_Smith71: :D
Regardless of what people say about the Control Stick minigames, I didn't have a hard time with them.
J_E_Smith71: Seems legit
Well the fact Nintendo got sued for it is proof enough

thelonecubone cute
GOOD IDEA

GLAD I THOUGHT OF IT
my top two worlds to go to would be pokemon and mlp and maybe minecraft

Gary Dissaprooves
also how is Mewku?
with all of his Girth
Eeeehhh, 1st gen.
Mewtwo and Haku
You get 8 badges. Gary has 10.
what about me? :P
or Haktwo
Nah
Mewku?
AJIsHaunter: your argument is invalid
No legendaries
TECHINICALLY
He's not a legendary
Gary's always one step ahead of you. No exceptions.
He's listed as a legendary
He counts
Born from a science experiment, no one knows of him
fuck you and your pokemon logic
but he's a Genetic code from a Legendary pokemon
but nevertheless
AJIsHaunter: What if I trip Gary
but everyone knows of him in the games :P
Ill choose someone else
Haku1013: you love dragons, dont you?
HoodEvee: Gary already made a clone of himself to trip you.
thelonecubone: Yes... why? >.>
not you
thelonecubone Yes?
brb
I suggest Natu
AJIsHaunter: More sacrifices for the burger god
...
Natu1013. :3
Haku + Natu = Hato
sorry
Hatu
neyh
Hmmm
nyeh
I actually liked Natu as a kid. :D
Not bad, Haku1013.

Hatu1013.... going into the maybes
Haku1013: you could be Gabite?
Ew, a 4th gen.
PICK A DAMN POKEMON
Hakite?
I shall choose a 1st gen pokemon
It has been decided
All pokemon are awesome
Stop being concieted
Raichu1013?
DashWithRainbows: hate it? wont metion it again then, when you're around that is
everyone knows 5th gen pokemon are best
YES
nyeh
Haku-ukah would break the rules...
Meh, I lurk a lot, thelonecubone, I can tolerate 4th gen.
The only one I like is Gallade.
eh, okay
ooooo fire
I was going to to go with Pikaku
/me drops a rock on Raichu1013
the only good pokemon is Snorlax
but Raichu is cook to
and Slaking
but mostly Snorlax
Sounds like Macarena
Dear bronystate. I just realized I learn about new movies when someone PMV's the trailers. Not sure what to make of this...
13this is one of their most abstract mixes i find

08,01Buytoast: the furry fandom is more about being an anthropomorphic something than it is about having actual fur

You know what I haven't had in a while?
08,01i once knew an anthropomorphic hamburger

You have to use them right, though

i almost forgot about Hoverbashful
I had an anthropomorphic female wolf....
the four winged secret lost cousin of yellow quiet
I vill make ONE NOW...
WHY AM I SAYING THIS
08,01CrystalPhoenix: it's okay, i had an anthropomorphic comet moth
/me 's OC had a gender change in an RP with someone

08,01CrystalPhoenix: yes, i did

was he already in his moth obsession when you met him?
as in a moth spawned from a comet?
or did YOU started his obsession on moth?

08,01oh wait, yeah, i remember his thing about oths
his blog is basically a moth gallery now
08,01i don't think i started it...
AssaultWithEmbraces was it due to the genderbender belt that is buried within most D&D editions?
08,01i hardly had a chance to speak with him at BUCK
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music of the Day #34
alrite I'll leave ya to it be back tomorrow at 7ish, maby bty EQD!!!
Mutterdude, nope. Not related to DnD at all. It was my OC and someone else's. He wanted to be a female and thus it happened.
Huh
Don't ask
how long will the music last?
/me slow dances with herself to the song
08,01i'm completely obsessed with moths
08,01i should bond with him over this next BUCK

Alright guys, let's chill out.

Eddmario: Implying everyone's seen the guide info

Eddmario: I avoid even the guide or episode synopsis.
Eddmario, some people do not check those things
Eddmario, it's a spoiler if you disscuss it here.
Wow. Eddmario, thanks for ruining it.
AJIsHaunter: Do I even want to know what I missed when I went to take a shower?
13i love how the fire pops in time with the music
>tv guide
SpadeKyurem[R]: I have no idea, either.
i dont even have a tv
SpadeKyurem[R], nope
I just got back.
So, this weekend's gonna be fucking awesome!
Well, now we know its a scootaloo ep
Should there be sound?
You do that next week and you won't hear the end of it.
Jmo: ?

Kinixys: Babs Seed already did that
Friday is the VGAs, saturday morning is a new ep, and saturday night I'm going to go see Trans-Siberian Orchestra live

Eddmario, WHAT?! Repeat the last part? About TSO?
AssaultWithEmbraces: Eyup. I'm going to go see them live.

THIS SATURDAY NIGHT!
Eddmario: I haaaaaaaaaaaaaate yooooooooooou <3
Shizuka: It says off air

HoodEvee: I think the overall reaction to Magic Duel has been the most positive.
It hates you too
So, did anyone watch Attack of the Show today?
Eddmario: Take pics if possible and tell us all about it so I can envy in envy
Kinixys: Don't make it better :I

Cause with how many there are in the game, everytime I see a fire I think of it. XD
Kinixys: That reminds me, has anybody gotten a chance to play the new Skyrim DLC that came out today? I'm waiting til after x-mas to get it as I might be getting cash, gift cards, or ms points for it.
Please, no spoilers. Just say if it's as epic as Dawnguard was.

The fuck is a chia?
Chia-pet

Chia-pet. A small pottery animal (usually), hollow and filled with water, and spread with small seends of a simple plant that gorws in it's grooved surface. Basically, an almost foolproof indoor decoration.
Shizuka: If it involves booze, then probably.
08,01Ryunosuke: the hell?
08,01is that pony inspired?
Ryunosuke: Da fuck am I looking at?
08,01or something else completely?
Eddmario: Well... I'm a bit behind playing Morrowind for the first time, but I guess it would be pretty cool to revist Solstheim.
Ah, I remember seeing TV ads for Chia pets all the time.
^
08,01because there's 6 of them, and i can see how each would be one of the mane 6
Kencolt: And just like everything else you can orderon the phone, they're not as accurate at all.

Welcome back, NocturnalBlade. I don't think you missed much. :)
08,01so that could be "maic"

SpadeKyurem[R]: I don't think so, since they're made from Netherrack...

I see Shizu is having fun with flash. :D <3
08,01the funniest ones involve flat vowels followed by soft consonants
Um, what?
Bon Bon. Go home. You're drunk.
She looks pissed
Should I be scared?
HoodEvee: I have no idea, honestly.
08,01bum, fondler, mufler
08,01*muffler
08,01i kjeep spelling that wrong...
13it's just a liiiiiittle too slow
08,01maybe the funniest ones have those balanced out with harsher souds too
dat lyra
o____O
08,01a good example: bum tickler
I wish I could dance like that ;~;
show trixie doing carameldansen
Inb4 Shizuka plays something unexpected
Is this a pony parody of an anime dance?
08,01they're not funny because of the meaning of the words, they're funny because of the sounds
Vordox: Too late
13yes i'm looking for every animation in /r/mylittlepony <<
08,01and they all follow more or less the same cadence and rules of construction and balance
Shizuka: Careful..
08,01anyhoos, there's a bit of humour theory for you; hope you've learned something

The wheels
<.... LAWL
MY GOD
lol da WHEELS
WHEELS
/me runs away
I'm just going to work on it tomorrow morning
So is Wheels a new meme now?
here: http://iambrony.jsmart.web.id/mlp/gif/30194__safe_animated_lyra_spiderman.gif
I believe so
08,01Canadian_Brony: that's not a very good one in this context because it have too many harsh "k" sounds, and no balance
hopefully I wont regret doing it, goodnight Afflict :)
SpadeKyurem[R] a new BronyState meme is created every 17 seconds.
SpadeKyurem[R], I guess so too
08,01maybe if you pair it with a 2 syllable word with soft souds, it'll work
So how many meme have we created?
mother cocksucker?
dude stop it..
........
And how many have we run into the ground?
Um, maybe we're taking this a bit too far.
08,01Canadian_Brony: actually, this is why the word "fucking" is such a good expletive
trixie dancing carameldansen FTW lol
xD
SpadeKyurem[R]: So far, G** IIRC.
AJIsHaunter: i dunt get it :I
Does "I blme Sxyprtdr" count as a meme?
GAK had so much potential. ToT
08,01it has a lot of balance in its sound
T_T not G@K
AJIsHaunter: The world record holder for the fastest meme made and killed
Nippony: I see wat ur name iz
maybe that's why I like to say "fuck" alot.
Nippony: I never saw it having any potential.
That, or because I'm a teenager :p
We created a meme and killed it in less than 24 hours
and then intellectual discussion about swear words
Haha.. just found out not to say that.
the g-word
<---- LAWL
XD
Dat scootaloo face
That Scootaloo
Scootaloo: "DEEEERRRRRP!!!"
lawl applebloom, scootalo and sweetie belle?
:D
scootaloo*
08,01Canadian_Brony: actually, because it starts with 2 very soft sounds (f and uh), and continues to the same "k" sound, it can be very effecively paired with "cocksucker"
Applejack doesnt put up with this shit
XD
If only this was a screensaver
Applejack was tired XD
^
and AJ's like "I'm surrounded by idiots"
dafuq
PONIIIII
POOOOOONY
08,01let's try this... "mint mashing fucking cocksucker"
Shizuka: Can't find the "Ladybug" dance Twi does? XD
Thats all I hear when I listen to this music or what ever
AW YOU RUINED THE GOOD TIME
and i got kicked again
08,01maybe not so well
Too fast. :(
milkshakes
wao
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8iv9hFqeH1r30tino1_500.gif
08,01maybe just "fucking cocksucker" on its own is good enough
08,01yeah, i like that
SpadeKyurem[R]: :D
I just got the "Pooniiiii" thing.. now I see why this song works so well.
:D
08,01especially if it's really out of the blue
"You fucking cocksucker"
that's my new catchphrase
/me spawns a wheelbarrel
08,01Canadian_Brony: in my opinion, it works better without the "you"
08,01and in a posh english accent
/me cuts off the wheel
08,01then again, lots of things are funny in a posh english accent
so whats the song called?
UNTZ
DitzyDerpy15: Call ON Me
Or PONIIIIIIIIIII
What ever you prefer
I'll have to get my friend to try that. He can do such a good posh accent. I can only do irish.
08,01Vordox: i think the repetition of the "k" (rule of 3's), and the balance of the u's and the f make it good
Gimme 20$
08,01curses, i miscounted

It was too big for the screen Shizuka XD
13that was about 25% size too
08,01but moreover, scotland has its own children's TV programs
-_^
08,01so even if there *are* people from the UK in here, i can't nerd out about shared childhood experiences
08,01because English people never got to experience The Singing Kettle
08,01or Mr. Boom
I had elmo growing up
you wanna know what we have up here? Discovery, Discovery World HD, Discovery Science, Investigation Discovery, and (R.I.P.) Discovery Kids.

I hate these ads interupt my stream viewing
Going to be such a bitch during pony episodes
if only there were any browser applications to prevent ads
PYRO IS THINKING WITH PORTALS
SpadeKyurem[R] Adblock Plus. If you have IE, get Chrome or Firefox THEN Adblock Plus.

08,01Unnr: i remember having to memorise and recite Burns in primary school
I never minded the ads before but Im not getting fucking adblock
08,01it's one of those standard scottish things
BRB again play MW3
SpadeKyurem[R]: Then good luck, then.
inb4 scariest damn thing you will ever see
These how ever get annoying with the fact they stop the stream and just play a un skippable ad
08,01see kids, this is why scotland is awesome
SpadeKyurem[R]: Why on earth not?
08,01we have Rabbie Fucking Burns.

Is That A New Stream Box?
Thanks for the warmth and music Shizuka ^_^
Hi, Laurayne. :)
Thank you Shizuka for the always awesome stream.
08,01Unnr: also, the trick is either to chase the haggis the wrong way round a mountain, or to dig a pit and place an open bottle of whiskey inside it
I mean really, Im not going to get ad blocker for something Im only going to use like one a week
I use Adblocker all the time.
Dat bass
YouTube ads (even in-video), pop-ups, stupid pull-downs, videos, crap that covers up the game you're about to click on.
Thanks for the steam, Shizuka
<--- Whaaat...theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This is why i liked Mips and LimeV because the ads didnt fucking fully interupt the stream
13media player makes this so epic when slowed down half speed
tnx for stream Shizuka

08,01maybe some heart too
08,01all good stuff
ustream works on phones, which is awesome imo
SpadeKyurem[R] it's for idenifying your monitors if you're dualing.
08,01and, of course, spices and seasoning
Nothing wrong with hearts and liver-- or mince. Always been a bit off about lungs tho.
08,01well, it's all edible
08,01and delicious
08,01dmanit, now i want haggis...
Lungs are gristle. And damn near nothing else. ENVER found a lung I liked.
Just don´t, for the love of all that is holy, buy a tinned one
NEVER.
08,01eeew, tinned haggis...
nothing is more foul than mass produced tinned haggis
*shudder*

It's so cuuuuuuute :3
Gahhhh
daaaaaaaaw its tooooooo cuuuuuute~
Does anyone remember the English Dragon Ball theme song EXTREMELY catchy?
AJIsHaunter: i think so?
08,01Unnr: if i find anyone eating that crap, i'll beat them to death with what's under my kilt
Unnr: OF course there is. There's home-made haggis made by someone who doesn't know how to DO IT RIGHT. Now, THAT'S a horrible thing.

08,01by accident
xDD
Canadian_Brony: That sounds like experience talking
08,01it was stained orange for a week
Actually, not tat I think of it, it's less a sausage and more a pudding-- in the boiled savory pudding sense-- what with all those oats taking up space. Except in a bladder or stomach, rather than a cloth or bag.
Unnr I'm just a fountain of (ir)relavent personal experience stories.
08,01Kencolt: aye, it's ap udding
what is ap udding?

Canadian_Brony: Its like a pudding, but with tourettes
and tourettes are . . ?
wait, I'll just google it

Ohai Laurayne
And Today Im Sick
So we're your sick buddies :3
Then you should be in bed getting some rest Laurayne :P
Do you like our new stream embed?

Yes
i like the slide show ^_^
AJIsHaunter: thought you might like this, has organ and thnderstorm
Yeah, that's a neat feature
AJIsHaunter: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUxMoQ-Xi2U
So, does anypony have Borderlands 2 for Xbox?
Cause i'm bored
And Ive Been Layed Up For 3 Days Sick. I Can Spare Some Time Online. In Getting So Stur Crazy Being Cooped Up
Yeah, say what you will about Naruto; the show has very good music
^
i got the dbz budokai hd pack yesterday
Polydunami: i especially like that they use some interesting and unique instruments i never hear anywhere else
its good but they changed the music for budokai 3
Can you name some of them?
I'm pretty sure I've heard the shakuhachi from different animes.
Polydunami: i have no idea what they are unfortunately. one is a wind instrument, the other a string, thats all i know
Oh, the shamisen
You'd probably know what they were by the sounds rather than the names.
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/27/CGczqTJRQ0qxo8VVWtY2Zw2.png
yeah im searchinh them up on youtube :P
yeah shamisen sounds like it
shakuhachi sounds about the same too
Yeah, I kind of have a thing for music :$
i finished music school on guitar and remember nothing at all >.>
Well, you've still got the ear for different instruments
yeah, one thing i think ive retained is some music analysis techniques, although thats not very useful with most modern music as theres not much to analyze in them..
Sleep... I should try that.
not in the general pop at least
unfortunately i never finished learning to play this on the guitar and havent icked it up since i finished http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfFbuT3I6A
finished music school i mean
Bigcheese: hi
Bloop
Hi wipergone2.
Not much of a talkative group here, huh?
werdz
It's pretty late at night. :D
Why are you that.
its pretty late...
AT NIGHT
i can get a conversation started, how do you feel about this
http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/12/03/gnaa_tumblr_worm_trolling_group_says_it_was_targeting_bronies.html
http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/dec/03/tumblr-cyber-worm-anti-blogging
I don't even know why we're listening to this.
we can have a sensible and mature discussion
Who told you to change your name to incog, anyway?
it is my name
Oh this kid again
Jmo: ?
Don't you have better things to do?
incog: I didn't even notice.
what better things would these be, Jmo
You tell me.
do you have an example?
gnaa
It's your life.
Surely you have one other thing to do.
its not my arguement
It isn't an arguement.
But surely you have better things to do then running around pretending to be a part of GNAA
wut
Jmo: huh
when was he pretending to be gnaa
i can assure you, im not pretending
Cool story
incog: so youre part of gnaa?
yes, orginal 2002 crew
incog: and youre still a part of it?
Bye now
Lol'd
00,10admision of guilt, case closed
ga
k
yaaaaay
aw already, i didnt even get to the part of telling him he basically confessed
Right, let us move on
I Have A Question!
I knew I recognized that name here before.
Ohai Sumi
00,10ohhi
wassup, Laurayne?
Who's this incog fellow? I don't think I've seen him here before.
I'm still angry about derpy.
Is Pinkie Pie Supposed To Be, Like, The Ponyville Equivilant Of Jesus? lol https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/17/RvrDToctFEWgjUnOwOga4A2.png
Laurayne: she kinda is, aye
All I know is that someone had PMed certain users telling them to change their username to incog.
That's all I know
!cd
Episode 6 of season 3 "Sleepless in Ponyville" airs in 3 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 49 seconds (Dec 08 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
Bigcheese: Don't be. It's not reallly something to be angry about. We still have the episode where she's still the same lovable pony we know.
Polydunami: Ah, I see.
00,10General network nussance and such
We also have 5 episodes of nothing :(
She Can Teleport... Nuff Said
Oh look, someone finally fixed !cd
00,10formyunderstanding he cant even view bronystate
Bigcheese: Well, we don't NEED Derpy to appear.
changing your name to incog got you banned at one point.
00,10so he just lurks the chat between klines
I'm probably not the first one to notice him.
Sumica:who
Move on.
Discussion isn't worth going on about.
I'm okay with that
me too
Just a silly child who has too much time on their hands.
why, seems interesting to me
Who is ready for winter?
especially if hes a troublemaker, seems like something to be aware of
I am wanting some snow where I am
We get snow. Some years.
Pinkie Can Ever Scare Poor Woona D:
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/17/RJhVJSc7XUmkFE5UsKiQ6g2.jpg
We rarely get some here in SC XD
I do have to agree, it's something I think I should know more about. But if it's not up for discussion at the moment, that's fine.
AJIsHaunter: did u liked the song?
00,10Supposedly he's some one that messed with Furrnet and some other sites
Ah, I see.
according to whom?
You mean Asturias?
Polydunami: well that too, altho i was asking him about the naruto one :P
00,10he's been Klined on this network, and around mid summer his name was auto klined so he would PM people prenting to be an ircop and asking them to nickchange
Oh yeah, should've remembered that
Sumica: whts kline
00,10banned from network
twixie_sprinkle: I did like the song. It was nice. :)
k AJIsHaunter
that japanese wind instruments creates some excellent atmosphere
00,10as in cant use irc.ponychat.net at all
*instrument
Actually, I remember that part about PMing people.
00,10generaly Klines get shared cross networks too so a kline can prevent you from using IRC all together
Sumica: meaning ip is banned?
00,10it's a bit more then that but yeah
wipergone2: bigger than a single ip
banned from whole irc?
It's a possibility
or only this irc
00,10for sure this network,
00,10other networks it depends
Sumica: why is he klined
Messing with websites
from gnaa?
he claims hes from gnaa
i doubt tht
00,10could be any number of reasons but that is above my pay grade.
sumi isnt a network wide ban a g-line not a k-line
I didn't even know GNAA was a thing until One Bad Apple.
Polydunami: me to
I forgot GNAA was a thing until Bad Apple.
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/11/17/G29U38nPVUSNRAl3_LoKag2.gif
Im Bored lol
00,10farly sure it's a Kline cause that is what it says when they go poof
k lines tend to be for a specific server
lol Laurayne
but not always
unnr thats what i thought
who hates gnaa
I can't believe I never got that incog was short for incognito until now. Me and my slow wit -_(\
but some ircds use the term kline instead of gline
btw Polydunami thanks for naming those instruments, im liking their music
btw who incog
Glad I could be of help :)
wipergone2: the guy who got banned
wht happens if i put tht name in?
Don't.
wipergone2: you might be mistaken for him and banned too
lol
which will probably be a perma k-line
Put the name in.
Go on.
See what happens.
Pfft
but jaymoo, how do u do that? show us pls
u think am tht supid?
/me slaps Jmo with a brick
Ahahaha

woah woah woah.
They've started adding disney films to netflix.
I'm so excited I can't express it.

Man.. far cry 3 is amazing. Oh and hi guys.

Hi, Malmortius.

Hey cousin, let's go bowling!
No, I think you're the son of Einstein.
anazer time perhaps, kazin
...
it's just a matter of time before we get some of the syndicated cartoons, like Gargoyles and TAILSPIN!!
hi Malmortius
I want to see Gargoyles. I've heard good things about it
Mainly about the villain
oh, at first is's soooo good.
I used to love it when i was a kid.
I couldn't get into Gargoyles as a kid for some reason.
such good voice acting.
I foresee a downside to this when you say, "at first".
init half the cast of Gargoyles from Star Trek tng?
I knew the reason why people loved it, I just couldn't get into the show.
hi
It was a bit of a "transitional" cartoon i guess you could say.
Hey there, aniderp
*reasons
Also, hi aniderp|bestcakeever.
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
did i miss shizy stream?
Yep, aniderp|bestcakeever.
Oh dang
all i saw was fire
I missed Haruhi
I remember when I really liked it - I ended up moving later part of that year and we got sattelite and then I was hooked on DBZ on toonami hardcore lol.
So did you guys get to see Endless Eight yet? >:3
No. ;D

Dang it, dumb shift key. XD

It would kind of give itself away if someone was streaming.
This embed is very good about that
i ment, is anyone going to start streaming soon?
We're usually in the dark about that
11,02Refresh embed everyone :)
00,10Sorry too tired.

Sumica: y u no sleep?
Well, there's your stream.

Peach really needs to up her defenses.
Sumica: hey

Borrows from it, I think.
It's catchy
:D
Dammit, why you got to spoil.
"Wart Lives". XD
SuperBrony64: Cupcakes or muffins?
Polydunami: Wart isn't in this game, just to let you know. :D
You mean I got my hopes up for nothing? Damn :S
As far as I remember. he only exists in Mario's dreams.
Well, it's no big deal.
What.
-.(\
where da coin at
I don't even own a Wii U. I've never play a single NewSMB either.
These coins are too well hidden. NSMB2 made me lazy

Is Wart Lives a meme?

Good morrow.
I don't think it is, Polydunami.
Hi, Meanwhile.

Hey there, Meanwhile
Tovler: SB's met some.
11,02I met who? o.o
Read up a few messages
SuperBrony64: DIdn't you meet some bronies that one time? With the sketch of some of the mane 6 playing the Wii U?
hey SuperBrony64
Saw one who drew milkshake Sweetie Belle
can we have south park soon?

SuperBrony64 will we get south park soon?
He got hungry
For tacos, I suppose
I need to learn how to add folks
Checkbook balancing?
What the heck? He already DOES have all the Star Coins!?
i might host a aussie halo 1 server
anyone up?
Kecleondarihu: I think he missed a few.
Is there a special world like always?
AJIsHaunter, unless there are maps in this entire area that he hasn't touched, he's got all the coins.
One of the Star Road requirements was to get all of the coins in Peach's Castle.
Star Road, huh?
That's a thing in this game?
Kecleondarihu: Ah, I see.
Polydunami: I forgot what it's actually called, so I just call it that.
It's basically the Special WOrld of this game.
Heeellooo #bronystate!
Hi, xles. :)
Hey there, xles
Haven't seen you in a while
I've been around. Kind of idling most of the time, but I've been around.
SuperBrony64 we love your cookies
11,02i liek cookies :D
/me gives cookie to SuperBrony64

SuperBrony64: If you like cookies, and like ponies, would you very much like pony cookies?
SuperBrony64 will we get south park soon?

Hey there, DerpyCooler
What's up:d

What???:)
Seems SuperBrony64 can't seem to get access to the special world.
brrrrr, cold. I need my mornin' tea. Earl gray, hot!
pinkie pie body wash!
/me licks AdamTheDuck back :3
Hehe:d
Oh, you have to beat the final boss
Dammit, Bowser Jr.
SuperBrony64 you will be licked
/me licks SuperBrony64
You should never have been.
May I ask what Botkiller weapons do?
AJIsHaunter, nothing different
I'm more wondering what the are, to be honest :S
*they
AdamTheDuck: Okay. Thanks. :)
AJIsHaunter, just looks and they are the same as "strange weapons"
AdamTheDuck: Ah, now I see.
Polydunami: I think they're weapons themed after Mann vs. Machine, if I recall.
Still clueless :S
So I looked it up, and it seems to be a TF2 thing
SuperBrony64 ima distraction
That was hard.
Polydunami: Mann vs. Machine is a mode in TF2 in which you and 5 players are pitted against a tower defense mode. Some of the weapons you can get are botkiller weapons, themed after that bots in said mode.
I really don't know much about the game.
Polydunami: That's fine.
I would get into the game, but I'm afraid my keyboard does not support rollover.
That is, can't push too many keys at once.
bowser is fucking huge
I don't have the game, but I trying to do research so that I'll be ready and somewhat skilled at the game when I play it.
*Im
Bowser is taking lessons from his son, Ludwig

Now that is annoying.
Either way, you get a fire flower?
If you manage t find and hit both blocks, yes.

Seems awfully anti-climactic.
climatic?
Whatever
SuperBrony64 did you already beat it?
11,02This is the best Mario game created.
too short
Getting kissed on the hat
You think Peach'd let Mario take her out on a date or something, but nope. Kiss on the hat. :D
I love these classic Koopalings much better.
All we see is the kiss on the hat. No telling on what they do when we're not around.
poor phallic hill
Or the nose
SuperBrony64 southpark time?
castle looks different from here.
Is this the Superstar World?
nope
Well. What do I know. :P
2nd last world

Mario says, "Fuck off."
To physics
oi SuperBrony64 oyu watching the chat at all?
he's always like that :<
He's kind of busy right now
11,02I can't talk and play a game at the same time :<
SuperBrony64 what other games you have
I've seen him post his list before.
It'll take up maybe two pages of chat
11,02For the Wii U? I have Skylanders Giants, Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Nintendo Land, and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed
oi SuperBrony64 is there a achivement system on the wii u?
11,02Only if the game includes it
11,02But not system-wide
dats stupid
does black ops have it?
Well, you don't NEED achievements.
SuperBrony64?
What secret level?
They're just fun to collect. They're not a requirement.

So. Will we ever see LOST on this stream?
Just a random thought
11,02JRP2234: No, unless you access the Wii Shop Channel in Wii Mode
So what is this secret level business?
show me wii mode]
There are secret exits in some stages that lead to secret areas/stages.
Oh, so like in Super Mario World.
Yep. Pretty much. :)
like how there were 2 secret areas in the Valley of Bowser.
Oho, that's the missing level
Wait, do you mean the map where everything is dark?
SuperBrony64 can i ask you somthing?
11,02yeah?
try sstream your 3ds

Damn you, auto-scrolling :|
I'm guessing that level's going to be similar to SMW in which the next level will be a back door for the final level?
SuperBrony64?
JRP2234: give him some time, hes busy atm
11,02JRP2234: I don't want to as it's hard to do :/

VIVIX, DOESN'T CHANGE ONE THING.

What log loaded message?
Gold_Demona, you can't zoom out :P
Gold_Demona, and the first page you see is a mess
You can, at least in mangamaster's paintchat
AdamTheDuck: So it's SUPPOSED to be too big for the window? O_o

Paintchat was abandoned in 2003 I think- there's a lot of finnicky things to it- mangamasters has a lot of good tips on how to make it work when it breaks, but their site seems to be down
yeah- when I press zoom out the canvas breaks, hm
oh wait now, it breaks, then --flashes the screen, and then works
cant zoom out..

You'd want that, wouldn't you.
Havok: what are you doing???
Yes, I would.
Dunno, I imagine you're tallish, skinny, pale skinned, scruffy face.
:3
Nah, he's short fat tanned and is clean shaven.
Don't you know anything?
Like you'd know
Know better than you Koalabreath.
You're both wrong. Everyone knows that he's a pony.
Phase4: not again...
/me slaps Gold_Demona around a bit with a large trout
00,02Eli, its 1:41
00,02thats my excuse
Phase4: good excuse... it's 3:41 pm here... but i'm probably just as tired
09,01my people
00,02ohai NewDCD
'Lo DCD.
Hi NewDCD
Haidere NewDCD
00,02few more rounds then i need sleep
Oh yeah, you never commented on my description Ash.
Oh yeah.
Hmm, I'm not very tall, 'bout average hieght, I am skinny, quite pale skinned, no scruffy face.
Not bad Joomay.
Not bad at all.
Damn.
00,02my method of repetedly jumping seems to be failing
00,02cant imagine why
Man Phase she knocked you over the building.
I mean you frickin sailed.
Phase, when you do that and get low on health, just run around with the escape plan
That's what I do :P
00,02DashWithRainbows, thats what i also do but tired == cbf running away
how do you add mlp charecters to tf2
I just rocket jump like mad now :P
Not my favourite map.
djblazekin This server has them as the Hale, you download them for this server to see them
The rest are still in development I think.
tl;dr
tl;dr = Shuddup Joomay.
Wanna go chavo?
Nah
Playin' TF2
Fine.
Too busy for you.
So am I but I'm not busy.
So what's your excuse?
do i need any other addons to make this mod work
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
00,02djblazekin, nope
00,02server ip: 208.167.245.210
awsome now if only i knew how to mod black ops zombies maps for a ponyville map
05implying blackops allows mapmaking
00,02^
00,02i didnt think any of the cod's did
Implying blackops is worth using in any capacity besides firewood.
00,02^^^
00,02even then, its plastic
00,02poor matrial for burning
Frisbee then.
00,02maybe
00,02cd's are not the most stable frisbee's though
lol Dash
05as shuriken
it's not an official thing but i've seen people play zombies with modded maps
05so its nothing for exbawx or peeeesthree
no it's pc and mac only
05in other words
05HAHAHA consoles
Sounds about right.
Hai beestate
/me likes both PC gaming and console gaming
09,01but above all portable gaming
09,01get on my level : 3c
same with the orangebox on consoles besides fpss are ment to be played with mouse and keyboard
Your level is casual.
/me dances
Besides, those tiny screens give me eyeache.
/me BOULDER PUNCHES Meanwhile
09,01for some reason I've found that last gen and this one, better games are getting released on portables
09,01take Resident Evil Revelations for example. It's actually a survival horror game unlike the last few console outings of the series, and might be the best RE of the last few years
09,01I think it might be a better horror game than 4
09,01so yeah
Yes AssaultWithEmbraces
It is
Well.
It's Kinkie Pie, AssaultWithEmbraces.
:D
:]
This cereal needs either sugar or raisins
Both
Use both
Raisins are evil.
Or some lucky charms mallows
yeah except mgs snake eater for 3ds the controls are wonky and you'd get better sound and visuals on the psvita version
Raisins are delicious.
They're grapes that have been possessed by mephistopheles.
Eating a raisin is karmatically the same as stabbing an orphan.
So you eat raisin every morning.
So, I can stab orphans without feeling guilty?
Sweet
Mephistopheles?
05ok it happened again Phase4

Best breakfast ever cheeseburgers with macaroni with bacon it

I had steak and eggs for breakfast once
My family makes fun of me for it whateverr chance they get
Why? Steak and eggs is good. D:
I was living with my parents at the time
I ate it for breakfast before school that day
I had sushi for breakfast once ._.
It wasn't cooked right
Where are you going to be doing when the world ends
Isn't badly cooked sushi dangerous?
Laughing at the people in nuclear shelters
Havok: It's sickening
Oh
doing secret stuff...lol
clopping
^
No
when i come out of the nuke shelter zombies might be walking around so i have my kitana
._.
Zombies come first
Then nukes
Too much radiation shouldn't mutate, its a straight up death
Deranged cannibals might be a problem
thats close enough to zombies
More secret stuff :>
secretive phase is secret
Zombies are walking, flesh eating corpses. Zombies have to die first

So very yellow.
o_o
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
Oi, what you want, Joomay?
Um. Stuff.
Give me your money.
I find conspiracy theories very interesting. I like listening to them, even when I don't believe a word of it.
hello everypony :)
Heya valoreins :)
Hi valoreins
Gold_Demona: People don't believe in conspiracy theories becuase of the government
Its true!!
/me explodes
Barlubetoes: :O
Gold_Demona: well yeah, some make for an interesting narrative, but I don't believe in big conspiracies controlling the world :|
MadSurge: Yeah, if that was true, I'm pretty sure the world wouldn't be as messed up as it is. :D
05just did a test
Gold_Demona: or even more messed up :D
lol
05turns out i can send 2Mb/s to people in the US

Huh.
So.. what would you send us at that speed?
MadSurge: ...What?
Please say swedish hoties...
Everlasting_Joy: magic blanket :)

Poor Spike
05im saying that when i stream to US people
Wouldn't feel out of place in FiW
Well if that magic blanket can make me sleep better, than yay.
05its still in their own connectiosn hands if they can see it or not
05:P
Wrek: What was the old rate?
I almost never have a problem seeing your stream, Wrek
05old rate was the same
05but if you sit in say finland
05i can send you aprox 80Mb/s
05instead
hi
00,02i'm angry and stressed and not happy :(
Phase4: hello
05why Phase4?
00,02well i waited patiently through many rounds of tf2 just to get friendlys
Oh shit. Phase4 is going to Phase5.
00,02its not fun when theres only ONE server on THE ENTIRE PLANET with that game mode and a mod comes in and ruins it
Phase4: wht game mode
00,02then i broke the computer in the shed and had to go out and fix it manually
00,02but i coudlnt cause its keyboard is broken
00,02so i had to reboot and prey it worked
00,02then it started raining when i had to come inside
00,02now i cant make the software work cause the person who designed it was a complete idiot
00,02and i'm not happy :(
We need ponies! Stat!

whts wrong with Phase4
05so wait a mod ruined it
05how?
What software
00,02Wrek, was giving people immunity, screwing with game settings, stuff like that
Wrek: whts up with Phase4
05right
00,02the net result was a sizable group of friendlys huddled in the corner, if you've played hale you know this doesnt work
who's vidmaster4694? Cuz that's supposed to be my nickname for here
00,02Havok, ufw, bunch of scripts ontop of iptables to impliment firewalls

05wipergone2: whts up wth ur typin
Wrek: why should i tell
00,02if it doesnt have a symbolic name, it prints the port number, not the index
00,02so you have no idea what rule is what until you delete it
00,02one of those rules controlls the connection i'm using to edit the rules
Phase4: whts the matter

Sumica it snowed in england in the morning barely an inch but buses still changed destinations
00,10Oh I see plenty of snow up on all the mountains around us
00,10we just dont get the moisture over the vally required to make it snow
:O
00,10it's plenty cold enough to do so
Just not in the vicinity
I like snow - when it's not this hot outside... Barely freezing. +/-0C
This is just wet and tedious.
00,10the mesa gets some as well as the foothills due to the mountain shadow effect but never more then a foot or so.
00,10AJ looks pissed in that shot
We're stuck in a nice little drought, so snow has been virtually non-existant here.
And what we get melts or gets blown away, so :(.

00,10you dont eat the whole thing alone
Sumica: I was under the assumption it was just one piece.
00,10to go along with the turducken
Pinkie, Applejack and the Cakes in one confectionery

Everlasting_Joy: Yes! It would be worth every bite! ಠ_ಠ

Everlasting_Joy: Well, I can try, but you'd have to ask The Doctor about changing the date and all :$
what do they need the pilots for?
Sumica: Atm, I think you're talking about this Anime. How is intergalatic battulz a slice of life?
Sylandest: :(, oh well, can't blame me for asking.
00,10and i think you dont know what Slice of life is Serenity
/me pats Everlasting_Joy on the head
Lmao japan and Peter Pan

my roommate is certainly not honorable
he tried to piss in my laundry basket
:[
why?
O.o
He was drunk off his ass, is why :D
00,10"hey your clock wont flush"
Sylandest: I was going to say exactly that.
Sumica: Try hitting the snooze button
Sylandest: No no no, you have to turn the stove knob to 8.
He also tried to do it to my fridge
but I objected
piss flavored water is not one of my preferences.
00,10i hope you objected with a blunt object to his head
Sylandest, you should advice him to wear diapers when getting drunk
Sumica: I objected by turning him around and giving a swift kick to his rear into the bathroom
:D
Incendia: Its a good idea, neh, hehe
00,10had a roommate use teh cat box once.
00,10and not to take a piss

Derpy_at_work: Sumica is streaming Nanoha

mruczek:

full drive mode!
00,10wrong in so many ways
I don't get it. They're homunculi?
DO A SONIC RAINBOOM
Uh....how and why?
...They're not cyborgs.
MadSurge: the same question here
00,10in due time
d'awwwww
at the video
They're just creations from te Book of Darkness
in the end the Book of Darkness overcomes her and she dies
oh
:(
:$
sup Dark92Enigma
That only makes me more confused
hi alexxm! I've heard CM Punk is injured :(
Have you guys seen Game of Thrones done with ponies?
it's amazing
Dark92Enigma yeah i heard he isn't cleared to wrestle at TLC
CM Punk...?
VenHur: The Straightedge wrestler
Straightedge: no alcohol, no smoking, no drugs
00,10sounds boreing
Heya Dark92Enigma :)
Sumica: it's ok, that's their lifestyle :D
hi MLP_Brovakiin!
When is there gonna be more pony?
Sumica: I am straight edge, but I am not boring! Or at least I think :D
Trrrixy ..you did not ask that
00,10No I ment as being his wresseling gimic
you don't want to ask that Trrrixy
00,10Ponies you say?
Sumica: well then yeah
Why is it a bannable offense?
Sumica: ewww. ponies
Trrrixy: no, but you'll get anything but FiM
;_;
ponies are not allowed here. what do you think this is, bronystate?
Lol
You messing wiff me :D
request ponies and you'll end up watching the World's Biggest Tea Party
Okay
^
USTREAM is one of the bestest ways to stream anything, and plus, if you had AdBlock, it's even better without the ads.
Requesting anti-pony vids!
horses are forbidden here
wut?
00,10flashbacks
ah..
AHHHHHHHHHH
I knew it! THE PARALITIC GIRL IS THE MASTERMIND
thats what she had to do with it
Did I miss an important part of the plot?
Well then, that clears any problem! They're artificial, so they can be killed without regret~
00,10seems legit
BRB lunch time
Dat Plot
wut
was that about?
Then why are they trying to fill the book anyway?
00,10Because the book is slowly killing her
Are you sure it's not her previous illness?
That's one ugly bunny
00,10Badguys, not so bad
00,10but then.......
Where did one-dimensional villains go? :'(
Speaking of one-dimensional chracters, whatever happens to Donkey Kong Jr? :(
VenHur: he became the actual Donkey Kong
The original Donkey Kong is actually Cranky Kong :D
Well, it's true, the Donkey Kong from the arcade game becames Cranky Kong, while Donkey Kong Jr (though, not offictially known from Rare) might turned out to be the Donkey Kong we know since the Country games and onwards.
Shut constructs, go back in the book! :|
VenHur: my headcanon :D
the plot thickens...
00,10facefall
So there, I could be right 50/50.
Where the hell did she end up
Damn these Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare ads!
lol
00,10she's off on other dimentions trying to fill the book so she wont have to hurt people
00,10Emily_Y, adblock+
Though, Donkey Kong Jr and Donkey Kong are both in Mario Tennis (The N64 one, not the Virtual Boy one), but it's a spinoff, so we'll leave that to be.
So let me get this straight: giant monsters are weak, but ten years old are strong?
I run safari :(
00,10sorry to hear that
what is it with animes and putting cat ears and tails on characters?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Magic Duel Comics: Twilight's Training Montage / Support / Magic Duel / Disapproval
Why can't they be talking cats/dogs all the time? Sailor Moon had no problem with that!
No anime praise please...
arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Gahh, so many computer parts in my room
lol
YAAAAAY
arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Just prodded my toe on a bloody graphics card
Who is streaming?
PONIES :D
wut
00,10dont put parts on the floor then
Damn you Sumicaaaaaaa!!
Lunac: Sumica is
Sumica: Not finished with them, had no time to put em away
Sumica, why torture your fellow bronies?
i wonder if the creators of generation 3 even cared about characterization in the show
Friieeeeeeeeends... no wait
Because we need to be strong against trolling Lunac :D
NO!
No trolling either
GOAL!!!
Want to troll me Red vs blue marathon
:D
Yessss
Dat Spike Bravo
Digitime
Digimon 01! =D
I'll be back later
Bye Lunac
hopefullyno anime then
Dammit Sumica, settle on one anime! :D
I think my school teacher is trying to become a troll. Earlier today, she peered at me, pulled a grin and said "Problem?"
00,10oh little dose he know that DCD has plans for later
lol
Sumica: DUWANG plans?
/me glomps the room
00,10probably
/me glomps Ryunosuke
Why are all these mons' basic forms an amourphous blob? O_o
Japanese Openings > English Openings
how is everyone
venhur I concur
anybody here played with the digimon tamagachi things?
MadSurge, well they're babies at that point.
I'm fine, Ryunosuke.
Oh hey, Digimon time.
Right on time, Meanwhile.
AssaultWithEmbraces: so you say they're embryos? 'cause that would make sense
Ooh, THIS episode
Oooh SkullGreymon episode!
Woo
Oh this episode is boss, perfect.
damn. missed stuff
evening
MadSurge: I guess so. Sinc
Egg>Basic blob form>first form>Digivolved>Ultimate?
'sup
I've noticed they never blink
I think that's how the order goes, unless I forgot something?
...In the desert you can't remember your name... ^^
Hi Chrysalis
huh, no stream
Oh Etamon, you egotistical monkey mofo
ahh, this episode...
wait what there is a stream?
curse you internet
Yes.
Chrysalis: refresh?
i hate my ISP
brb guys
The order is Egg > Baby > In Training (husband calls it "onion form") > Rookie (what we're seeing now) > Champion > Ultimate > Mega Ultimate (the names are different in Japanese, but that's how I remember them)
LIES!
HE WOULD
YOU LIAR
id never try something like that! >.> hahahah
Wazzup?!?!
"I'd never try something like that!" Oh really, then explain how the fuck SkullGreymon happened.
lol
AssaultWithEmbraces: it did already?
I hate how they ruined this show with the later seasons
high tech radar system.... that relies on trip wires XD
Dark_Horst, it's going to. The episode started like 4, 5 minutes ago.
Personally Etemon sounded better when he was an Elvis impersonator.
ah
I agree Meanwhile
oh yeah, i remember that colloseum
I don't remember Etamon's Elvis voice a lot.
00,10yeah one of the few localisations I liked
dat dub
00,10there now you heard it
Thanks Sumi.
his iq sounded lower there
He sounds like Johnny Bravo, lel
AssaultWithEmbraces: Well, Johnny Bravo was also supposed to sound like Elvis, so that makes sense. :D
itlikes to not give a damn about actually translating
does this song only play in the japanese version?
Yup
Gold_Demona, they make everyone want to sound like Elvis.
>.> wut? why?
the english dub also threw all the soundtracks out the window and implemnted its one single track
EVERYWHERE!
How convienent. Mention the good ol days at soccer camp and travel to a soccer field in the middle of the desert
random soccer ball
completely safe
I wanna know WHERE the electricity to power the screen comes from.
00,10Emily_Y, can I use you to sheild my self from radiation?
In the desert.
AssaultWithEmbraces: MAGIC!
You can
Dark_Horst, bullshit :3
YOU BLEW IT!
You may not however
00,10Clearly it's solar powered
seriously though, the whole world is digital. things tend to not make sense
It's a trap!
loltrap
AGUMON YOU DOLT
ackbar was too late
Ahh badgreymon ep
oh wait i know this one
That looks like a costume he has on
probably is one
Look at his upper arm, looks like he tried to fix it but failed
best timing of dancing ever
like that little guy with the pelt
Dance Sumica~
Ohai Snow
Dude, that's gotta hurt!
00,10sudden music end
that'S a lot of volts
you know you suck when the theme song stops playing
curbstomp! curbstomp! curbstomp!
00,10dose this bug you? dose this bug you? dose this bug you? dose this bug you? dose this bug you?
Curb stomped.
Shut up, Tai~
isaac clarke would be proud
lol XD
burp
it's pikachu!
Dammit Tai, you be like Naruto and believe it!
AssaultWithEmbraces: i hope not, believe it!
Wait, monkey Elvis? WTH?! JAPAAAAAAAAAAAN
few do know that before his colloseum career, that greaymon was known as "the mexican menace" in the ring
There's a dimenionsal rift over there.
Snow: Oh god I suddenly shuddered and cringed at the english dub of "Believe it!" Soooo horrrible.
How convenient.
You got your crest, good job. Now let's GTFO before we all die.
uh oh
is it time
inb4 Taichi messes up
Tai what are you doing
Tai, staaahp
tai
stahp
Tai! STOP DJU FUUL!
Please tell me the monkey dies in the next ten minutes
you wish
MadSurge, I doubt it. I think the monkey is a Dark Master so it's not likely.
MadSurge: Etemon's several episodes away from dying. :P
should change it to english dub evertime the monkey talks
A what?
MadSurge: He's the final boss of this season
he aint no dark master
Nah, there are only four Dark Masters and they all showed up at once.
GODDAMMIT
uh-oh...
those guys aint until much later
NO TAI
oh yes
it's time
First Fail Anima, now an annoying monkey
TAICHI KAMIYA, YOU IDIOT
the end has come
OH SHIT
Dat expression.
that thing again
AW SHIT!
He sounds a lot scarier than his dubbed version
YAY!
Congratulations, Tai. You just unleased a Dark Digivolve. Fucking idiot.
lol, he tried to run
fish rocket?
ded
damn
MadSurge: After the monkey, we get a wannabe Count Dracula. :P
Well.
I keep getting pings. :P
SHARKPEDO
LOL
he fucked up
Gold_Demona: why can't this series have serious villains?
The trope for this ism I believe, "Good Job Breaking it, Hero".
MadSurge: Because it's not a serious series? :P
launch the torpedo, I mean SHARKPEDO
Because serious villains aren't as amusing?
MadSurge: what fun is there in serious villains?
the dark masters are serios buisiness you know
Let this be a lesson, kids: Don't force a Digivolve. Nasty shit will occurr.
What fun is there in being serious?
Snow: actual menace?
Serious villains were serious when we were all kids. :D
MadSurge: example of a not serious villain
05best villains are the ones that where the villain could jsut as well be the good guy
Discord.
05and vice versa for the good guy
Sudden Wrek.
00,10that was nanoha a bit ago wrek
Also, Electro Shocker sounds way cooler than Mega Blaster.
onion form :>
you're a failure koromon
If the Digital World had laws, Tai would be in prison for Digmon/animal abuse
Sitting down is not stopping?
THINK ABOUT IT
you've let your master down
how can you call yourself a digimon now
Now kick the ball!
lol
00,10kick the baby!
Don't kick the baby!
proably get some good air
kick the baby. *punt*
00,10nah he's all lumpy and shit
00,10would waste too much energy
Try the egg
kick the baby reminds me of a german commercial
But seriously guys. If the Digital World had laws, Tai would be in jail for that stunt he just pulled
Eeyup
But it doesn't, so he's forgiven. XD
00,10if it had laws they would probably have bigger fish to deal with
00,10you know such as the destroying the world evil
if they had laws monkey man would probably be getting the shower shuffle right about now
AssaultWithEmbraces: for making a wimpy dinosaur a badass skeleton? That would warrant a medal!
what is this
terrorism and attempted murder and all
If they had laws the digidestined would be in prison for slavery
its not slavery if the digimons are ok with it.
MadSurge: The badass skeleton was a result of forcing a digimon to Digivolve when they damn well knew that they couldn't.
Hell, Agumon could testify in court against Tai and so could the others.
00,10it's a good thing they are never in a situation like that again in the show >_>
but wheres the fun in that
AssaultWithEmbraces: then why he managed to do it?
00,10you know the we need to digivolve but cant
this song
could digimon be feeling pain as they transform
it is awesome
Sumica: *cough* Season 2... *cough*
well, Elvis IS the king
Fair point.
MadSurge: He finally caved in but as a result of Tai force feeding him it didn't really lead to the best results.
Wait, love is a plane now?
And hi
In fact all things considered in the evil digimon lineup he's pretty shite.
00,10but he's totaly evil, he had a whole army
AssaultWithEmbraces: so it's a BBD, Berserk Badass Dinosaur :D
Holla everypony! :)
00,10armys make you evil
and he made gears
GEARS
OF WAR
MARIAAAAAAA
AND EVIL
MadSurge: That's like someone MAKING you eat when you're sick and you know yourself that you don't feel like it. The end result: possibly getting sicker and/or puking
im just saying, digimon is darwins evelution theory, only cooler
evolution*
Meanwhile: But what about Diaboromon and Kokomon?
Tai quit being a downer.
I don't remember either of them so I have no idea.
AssaultWithEmbraces: but I love being fe-actually that's a good point. I still don't get this series.
00,10she's lost it
Troll cactus.
That's one big cactus
00,10Jennai you ass
00,10oh sorry Genni
Pfft, now you're worried about spelling?
Meanwhile: Diaboromon was the virus thing in the first part of the digimon movie that was messing with the phone lines. Kokomon was Willis' creation and backfired somehow
00,10you would have corrected me had I not Meanwhile
You mean this guy isn't secretely the villain?
I didn't correct your "armies"
just punch the old man and take over the continent
btw, it'S Gennai
you can do it
B)
GASP
Can't punch the old man if it's a hologram, Buytoast
Ship.
then find the real old man
IT'S THE TITANIC'S GHOOOOOOST!!
abd socket to him
00,10sand steamer
Boat in the desert, makes total sense
AssaultWithEmbraces: No, Diaboromon was Willis' creation. It infected Kokomon and that's why he went crazy.
MadSurge: Digital World
Dat look.
O.O
and suddenly, seduced
Gold_Demona: Ohhh. I knew Diaboromon was made by Willis and had something to do with Kokomon somehow.
Empowering.
Gotta remember that one.
Ewww preteen slut
Oh god, Mimi. Stop whoring yourself
tease level increased to 5!
oh my
ALL THE CLOTHES
Inb4 it's a trap
00,10looks like a yard sale
o my
you know, she's kind of like rarity
only less refined
how many times have they been fooled by the villians luxery location now
And not as prissy?
Dark_Horst: i see what you did there.
Yeah, the first thing I would do upon getting on a ship in the middle of the desert is not strip. XD
I like how they're eating by waving their hands
anime logic
/me sighs "Boys."
deal with it
Sylandest: You mean you don't do that?
00,10Kip Pithon
lol
Surprise, he's actually a huge ugly bird.
BIRDY.
Human into a giant chicken...
WHAT DAFUQ, JAPAN?!
00,10wired ship
00,10makes sence
VenHur: Japan. That is all.
It's the chicken from mars!
/me pokes Snow :3
/me is poked D:
It's Chicken Boo
My cat is such a spac
Sumica: you telling me your luxury cruise ship runs on batteries? you crazy?
Dah!!!
OH MY GOD
correction. he crazy
SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
WHAT EVEN.
AssaultWithEmbraces: Damn it, now I wants to lives in Japan for some reason.
That an interesting way of censoring.
Etamon is clearly compensating for something besides a crappy costume.
i was just aboutn to say something about his critch teddy
*crotch
See. Trap
fish in the swimming pool
bam
explain that
Holla Dark92Enigma :)
Hi Dark92Enigma
He pulled fish randomly out of a statue last episode, don't question the reality warping power of Marching Fishes.
hola thelonepony!
00,10wake and bake
the stare
Dark_Horst: fish? In water? PREPOSTEROUS
/me abraza a thelonepony
Meanwhile: Next time the fish'll come out from someplace.
OH COME ON
The_Browncoat: como te fue en tu examen?
yep. chicken
kekekekeke
Dark_Horst: Gomamon's attack makes fish appear out of nowhere. :P
That's not how you call for a chicken
Chicken is OTP. Nerf plz
It is however how you call for a Chickenmon.
Gold_Demona: i know, but does science?
Always with the naming of the attacks.
Dark_Horst: Science? In the digital world? Puh-leeez~ XP
and cue the moment
Here's an idea: DON'T LOOK AT HIM
The_Browncoat: sorry, tab fail, i was talking to thelonepony
It's like Yu-Gi-Oh and constantly yelling yourself hoarse to name a card
crazy internet magics
Why do people never close the window?
AssaultWithEmbraces: So they can jump out of it, obviously.
GilDash, I mean after they climb through.
AssaultWithEmbraces: You ever tried to close a window from the outside?
POISON IVY!
GilDash, yes.
I like that he only has one animation for that attack.
yes. it IS a plant
GilDash: Sometimes a bastard, sometimes piss easy
Lucky for me, I have a pisswindow
Now jump
CUE KICKASS SONG: braveheart
And then lock it behind you?
GilDash: Yeah, I can't do that
bam. my bird is bigger. watcha gonna do now?
Time for some KFC
00,10aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Serenity: That was kind of my point. Otherwise it'd only take 2 seconds to open the window again. XD
Pfft.
Palmon Derelle.
do the cactus flip!
the US version had it's fans, but i always prefered the original <---- :)
Time for some roasted chicken! ~Yum Yum!
Shake it, do the diet dance!
Cactus punched you out
DO A BARREL ROLL!
wut
00,10abandon ship
I refuse that conclusion!
aaaaaaaaaaaaand they have their clothes back
Get in, I'll explain later!
Did they get their crests back?
yep
ABANDON SHIP, CRITICS AND CRTIQUETTES FIRST!!!!!!!
I didn't see anyone reaching for them.
And then they died, the end
MadSurge: Of starvation and thirst
to the side
TO THE SIDE
Jack Sparrow did it better.
AIM FOR THE SIDE
why do they never move to the side!
AssaultWithEmbraces: and a boat to the head :D
I'M ON A BOAT?
MadSurge: To the body
anypony?
Sylandest: Because they're not animated to do that. :D
"Did he come back to life?" oh so they were deliberately trying to kill him then.
i'm on a BOAT!
PHYSICS!
Wow, pwned twice by 2 different cactuses
what's that!?
sea ponies?
Dark92Enigma: Is it a motherbuckin boat?
that's trippy
shoo be doo

CACTI CAN'T BE THAT FLEXIBLE
Gold_Demona: eeeeeeeeyup
I REFUSE
welp he's ded
alright, who wants some KFC?
Well he's definitely dead now.
Meee!
FINALLY SOMEONE DIED
Dark_Horst, I dooo
Pass the drumsticks!
IT WASN'T A MIRAGE......it was done by the sea ponies
00,10oh and crest out of fucking nowhere
Why
Why is there a crest in a goddamn cactus.
Because
because /) convenient (\
Sumica: Welcome to hell, enjoy your stay.
because plot progression, thats why
00,10they are all as shocked as the viewers
Because anime
MadSurge: not the 1st one.......remember that evil monkey digimon which name i don't remember?
I forgot what Mimi's crest represents.
crying
because she whines so damn much
00,10slutyness
Sumica: yes.
Dark92Enigma: Etemon?
that too
only she can complain about upgrades
Element of Whoring it out.
AssaultWithEmbraces: Sincerity. Mimi's crest is Sincerity
She never asked for this
Kencolt: thanks for reminding me :)
I didn't sign up for 'dis shit.
Gold_Demona, ok
What's the tear again....Generosity?
Dark_Horst: i also can complain about upgrades.
00,10she is honistly the most loya......scanky of them all
oh
Dark92Enigma: Sincerity
None of them signed up to be saviors of the Digital world, actually
It just suddenly happened

Ah! Loud!
00,10thank you for that sound bood cat >_<
If you get to walk around with a talking plant you don't get to complain.

lol
Sumica: Gahahaha
00,10cat fell of desk on to keyboard
I WISH.......
Is kitty okay?
lolcat
Dark92Enigma: She's sincere when she needs to be
Sumica: Don't worry about explaining. My cat is a hugr spack
Or a guinea pig with wings, or an insect...or a dinosaur...
kitty is always okay
Piccolomon? Piximon. Piximon was badass.
dropping kitties will harm its surrounding more that itself
00,10but yeah Scoot tends to roll over in her sleep
oh boy, time for the best song
picolomon?

Sumica: I love how the name of the shows are next to the logo, congratulations on the improvements.
00,10it wont stop people from asking but meh =p
that villain has style
VenHur: Yet people still ask
00,10I would have to make it stand out to prevent that
This show always was totally bonkers.
what.
00,10then it would get anoying
Sumica: True, very true fact indeed-
Meanwhile: Well it really really bent the rules

VenHur: this is what Kronk does on his off days. When he's not busy cooking for the Emperor and whatnot.
Trampsack

It seems like he could've walked in there and stabbed him for much less trouble.
Aka Kronk, The wolf from Hoodwinked, One of the deers from Open Season, and the principal from Kim Possible.

Meanwhile IS a villian
GilDash: You're right, perhaps I'll shoot a blowdart with a microscopic robot that will tunnel into his nose and explode in his brain.
thanks captain obvious
Or, I could stab him. Then be back in my volcano base within the hour.
Meanwhile: That's more like it! Glad to see that degree in Evil Mastermind wasn't wasted on you.
By the way, Spider Man and Aqua Man costumes.
