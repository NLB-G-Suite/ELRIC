Well shes loud
Doctor House's diagnosis: SHE'S AN ATTENTION WHORSE
lol
@pony The biggest attention horse in all of Equestria
6 The biggest attention horse in all of Equestria is 15Sweetie 6Be13ll6e
wut
...can't really argue with that, though she IS best pony...
....
4She's not even fit to be best CMC
4That's Apple Bloom's position
Ohai Ghosties
Lies, Ghosties
Scootaloo is best pony
Best CMC is Scoots
Scootaloo is best chicken.
Or Dinky, if we accept fanfic-only CMCs
@pony Best chicken
6 Best chicken is 5Chief Thund11erho15oves
Scootaloo is awesome, though
BTW,i buried Scootatoo somewhere nopony will find her.
@Pegacorn in you garden?
Nope.
In Season 2, no doubt
Nope.
SHE GOT A STD
She got issues, son.
Evening Gentlecolts
oh yeah, I forgot, Zecora is best pony now.
hey AllisZero
Soup RP
I buried her in Dash's garden-OHGOD I SAID IT.
Zecora is not a pony
I tried to get into the chat all day at work
Spazturtle, that's like saying a black person is not a human
...
you don't wanna get in that minefield.
4It's not lies
4It's truth
4Apple Bloom is best CMC
4Period

4None of you just saw that
4No one
I'll accept that.
Hey
Not you, Ghosties, I will never accept what you just did. :P
since when have you guys been streaming?
4Good, don't even acknowledge it
4It's for the best
4SHHHHHHHHHHHH :P
Ziltoid all day
what episode is this?
So Celestia is both best pony and mai waifu... Sweet...
Ziltoid a good 7 hours now
7 14
DISCORD IS NOW BEST PONY
lol no
trolollololololo
Sea ponies are now best ponies!
Discord might not evn be a pony
So I'm curious now
Doesn't the plot of that S2 opening episode do very well with the introduction of Luna into the mane 6?
what?
I heard that Luna was in episode 7
If the speculation that Discord is what turned her into NMM, wouldn't it be fitting if she came out and confronted it?
No idea what you guys are talking about, and I'd rather not know until Season 2 starts airing :P
NMM is BAWS.
Maybe I'm thinking too much in terms of anime plot and not too much in terms of a children's show
I DUNNO BUT SPECULATING IS FUN
Also god damn it, in between EQD, BronyState and the HpTouchpad sale, I accomplished NOTHING at work today
alliszero did you read the script leak?
I think Derpy at some point travels back in time, and accidentally Nightmare Moon

CARDIAC ARREST
Hey RobotPinkie/
7 10 years old..
7poor girl
too much fat in cardiac artery, probably
clogged it
lolol, induring fat joke spam
I hate it when children I'm in charge of calapese, it real ruins my day
>yfw this wasn't a fat joke and just a serious hypothesis
/me 10is no longer overweight, still feels a little bit uncomfortable about watching this
Oh okay
7so rude...
I'm still overweight, though not as much as I used to be.
7I cant skipp this one cause all episode's follow each-other up
10It's cool, it's an interesting topic
Hey Ziltoid
SUDDENLY
that was smooth
Dermathil have you seen the series before?
Who other than House DOESN'T wear the labcoat?
10But it's like, I never felt inclined to lose weight because of health risks
note Dashite
*Nope
Being overweight isn't much of a health risk as long as you get enough exercise...
ohey Dermathil
10Well I didn't. Hence my being overweight
10xD
I'm sticking with my guess that the black guy goes.
though obviously there's a fairly strong correlation betwen being overweight and not getting enough exercise :P
10yeah that's what I meant XD
'Overweight' isn't a given weight to height ratio, it's 'Havign fat instead of muscles'. As long as you've muscles, how much you weight isn't really a concern .-op
I wish I wasn't overweight.
OH SHE MAD
10Then change it NT
10:3
Brainwashed by media.
lolol
LAWL
14This woman makes me want to gouge my eyes out.
10lol xD
Been doing that RBD. Not easy.
which woman?
Brainwashed by media and medical school.
14The one on House a sec ago.
Holy shit I only whiegh 70kg
Oh okay, the pregnant one
14Apparently House isnt a doctor and doesnt know at all what hes talking about. :P
>HFW she doesn't get a slimming growth spurt
who's sounding like a prick? The yellow-shirted person is!
I like chubby girls...
14I wight 110 pounds, dont know what the conversion for that is. lol
Oh he mad
House is!
It's hawt
way to give her hope based on not being fat anymore instead of not hating being fat, Foreman.
OTHER MALE DOCTOR BE RIGHT
House always sounds like a prick though.
14*weigh
7that's House
7Poor Wilson
7always gotta pay
woops, I ment pounds not kg
One way or another. :p
lawl
oh she mad
SHE BE POSSESSED!!!
HULK SMASH!
so many mad people geez
SHE BE WEIGHTING 666 POUNDS
Someone call an exorcist!
14lol
(that was a fat catholist joke btw. Don't take it seriously)
10NT you have my support, I've been there. To be honest I tried once, and when it was 'difficult' it was something I couldn't do. But then I had this random moment where I realised I'd fallen in love with myself. Turns out spur-of-the-moment narcissism is pretty good fuel for self-confidence
14People complain so much to these poor doctors.
Ahaha, oh man
Dermathil: hahaha
10also, octy, so true xD
Heh, Octy...
Where is that Octavia the Octopuss pick...
I used to be approximately 9001 pounds, I think...

14I've heard Octy used before :P
14Oh goodness...
(that's a lie, obviously)
14Dr Octagonapus! Blarg!
14There ya go.
14I aint even mad.
I don't know how your silly avoirdupois system works, you silly frenchies

10doctor Octo-motherfucking-gonapus! BLAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRG
With my height I should be about 75kg to be at optimal health.
10aah i don't use kilos *goes to google*
14I think I'm about 60 pounds under weight.
House is melting your mind
5aah i don't use pounds *goes to google*
14Lmao
lolol
I had myself down in the 190s, but then I shot back up after sleep issues.
you hate the french!
10I've lost 21lbs so far
14I'm German. I must hate the French.
14Kidding obviously.
10but I've not been trying for a couple months now
10also lol octy
i'm in my 190's, I guess, with pounds
10 21lbs is 9.5 kilos according to google
though I do appreciate that pound is a measurement of force instead of mass
so kudos on that
I don't know my weight. Has to be in the upper 220s.
7Wait your german?
HAHA
14I'm German.
Oh god this women is such a cunt

10 6
10^*
10lol'd
Lawl. I'd die before I hit that.
No, burn it on a cd, then put the cd in the microwave and stream that
Yeah, die of extreme excitement!
I'm thinking of writing a script to ban anyone who says Matt Smith.
What you think guys?
inb4 TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON

Oh man, DAT TARDIS
Matt SMith is best doctor
@pony best doctor
I do like Tennant the best, though.
6 best doctor is 7Mr Br15eezy
Pfft, people need to work MUCH harder to reach my God tier trolling.
5^ its soo truuue
Peter Jacbson is obviously best doctor
Dari, your idea of trolling is kicking people and going trololo. :p
>implied you are god tier trolling
Michael Jackson obviously had the best Doctor
My idea of trolling is choosing My Little Pony movie for movie night.
The one with the SMOOZE?
Dari, you didn't see my mood earlier. I was crazy.
That's not really god tier, that's just funny :P
Or shutting down our site during the first S2 episode.
>mfw I already saw the Smooze movie this year
Trololo.
now that would be it
Streaming G3.5 instead of S2 premiere, THAT would be god tier trolling
I'm just not harsh enuogh to do that. :<
Seriously, mad respect to any troll that does that. :P
5I definetly know what movie i'd pick if id get to choose
5Coneheads

Suddenly, hit Ctrl + something and I kill the tab

Hmm

MFW I unplugged my mic.
Whoops.

Give me a minute.
What was that adventure one with Rarity, Applejack, and Rainbow Dash?
got an image of a guy driving a riding lawn mower through a flooded street with two babies in his arms
/me gives Dari a minute
It's Dangerous Business.
Yes.
Its a dangerous business going out your door, FF.
You need to ready Dangerous Business
yeah
Octavia's Power Hour is a great comedy one.
mfw I realized how few non-clopfics I've read
>yfw I recommended it a while ago guys
Ok.
Stream's back up.
And it has both Octavia and Vinyl Scratch
Octavias power hour, heard good things
NOPE, didn't hear athing
Shades of Pink is really good
oh, so you're trolling didn't work...
FreezeFrame, what is that about?
It's about Pinkamena, and it's not grimdark
"Crazy pinkie pie without a pure grimdark tag?! That's a first!"
ooh, link please
oh hell not this episode
alright, i think i've got enough. hopefully. thanks guys
sad tag instead?
Nope, plain [Dark]
Love & Monsters?
gah
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/story-shades-of-pink.html
dark and grimdark are basically the same.
Yeah, this episode.
Not really.
just a word difference
Well, after a really good 2 parter.
Meh.
Without Grimdark, there's no deaths.
It looks even worse by comparison.
XD
Silvermane, not the best when it comes to mlp, but if you ever need a good Kim Possible fic, I'm your guy
It's the best treatment of Pinkamena outside of Pony Psychology series.
wait, the two parter was The IMpossible Planet/The Satan Pit right?
LOL
WUT
Wow.
I'd say it's a pretty accurate representation of the town
Nice and green too.
yeah, it is nice from the bluffs
but I live down at ground level
it's only about half as pretty down there
and I never notice the prettiness unless I stop and think about it
otherwise I just look right past it
>Scooby Doo

SUDDENLY
I just exploded for no reason in another chat, people were confused. XD
it's Washington, the state
Not mod chat.
Talking to one of my friends.
lawl
xDDD
I wonder if she sees views like that ever
Sent me this picture: http://i.imgur.com/RQ8Dq.jpg
It fucking blew my mind.
CALLING PHOTOSHOP
meh
Silvermane: I'm sure you've read it, but Witch of the Westmareland is still good.
Damn.
That view is just astounding.
"For Your Birthday, Princess" is just great.
yeah it is
I'd say it left me lost for words, but clearly it did the opposite. XD
Dermathil: I can tell by the pixels
XD
I'd love to have a house down hill from there
Oooh! "Off the Edge of the Map" has completed!
Dashite: sounds legit
and just hike up there every single day
Needs my flutterdash fix
14And from seeing a number of shoops in your time, of course.
Naturally.
>the internet literally melts
I mean, the picture is too realistic... IT CAN'T BE THAT AWESOME!!!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
MFW no one appreciates that unbelievable view.
Pfft, it's a fantastic view. :p
That's freaking gorgeous
I would love to see mountains one day
I've seen views like that before.
OH MY GOD, WHAT ELSE IS SHE IN?
And what particularly impresses me is that photos usually fail to capture just how impressive big scenes like these are.
So seeing that view in person.
Damn, my head might just explode.
yeah, in person must be the most amazing view ever
SERIOUSLY GUYS, WHAT ELSE IS URSULA IN?
Ben Nevis is the biggest mountain in the UK.
ah, fanart.
Thing is once you get to a certain height you can't see anything.
the fog?
Eeyup.
I noticed that in your pictures
Yeah.
it gave it its own kind of prettiness
OMG at chapter 3's start for Off the Edge of the Map
So, Doctor Who. Just pressed play, how much did I miss?
it may have been blocking the view downhill, but it made the pictures look really cool
SERIOUSLY YOU FUCKERS, WHAT IS THE ACTRESSES NAME?
Razyn: not much. people who noticed the doctor, formed a fan club
It was so damn cold ice formed on what I was wearing.
:O
wow
Very well. Time to enjoy some impressive knock off of Doctor Whooves.
suddenly, SCOOT SCOOTALOO
that's the only downside of heights like that
Yeah.
I'm not the biggest fan of being really cold
time lord rock?
hahahaha
MFW Ben Nevis is only about 1/6 of Everest.
OSHIT
shit's gonna get real
Top of Everest must be -20 to -40 or something. XD
EdwardNewgate: I DUNNO http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=Doctor+Who+Ursula
haha, yeah, I imagine
trolololol Dashite
BACK, BACK I SAY
I've never seen a mountain in my life
I wouldn't even need to climb it, I'd be content with seeing one from below
Snowdon and Ben Nevis were my first proper mountains, rather than hills.
to be honest, I've technically never seen hills either
THAT'S MOANING MYRTLE!
Ahh.
we only have bluffs here, which are kinda like hills, but flat on tp
*top
from below they look like hills
TORCHWOOD FILES
but from on top everything else just looks like a valley
Hmm, that sounds interesting.
... rapist.
you can kinda see what I mean in that picture I showed you
her name is Bliss?
this one

Oh jesus this episode

:P
I don't know about the worl

inb4 obliviousness
So do people travel to see them?
not many people know about them to my knowledge
Ahh
but whenever people drive through the area they almost always stop and look
you can easily tell who is and isn't from the area this way
:P

She puts up a face of bravado to hide her scaredness. She's very quick to run heedless into danger.
FreezeFrame, my hatred for RD is like Dari's hatred of Matt Smith
Granted, the later is a part of her greatest strength of loyalty.

Honestly, when has RD ever fucked up, EVER?
You hate RD?
: O
herospirit: actor for the Eleventh Doctor
I was exaggerating
Thank you.
hey GG
Let's play some awesome RD PMVs then.
but yes, I dislike her
EdwardNewgate: she couldn't do the Sonic Rainboom for years and years despite trying?
yfw this song is on my ipod
ow my ears
DO IT DARI, KICK HIS ASS :0
Edward: she fucked up when she broke the statue in BNE
I mean I'm impartial in this battle.
BOOM
OH YEAH
She fucked up 2/3 of her routine at the Best Young Fliers Competition, (and the Sonic Rainboom, as well as the other mitigating circumstances, was awesome enough to negate those).
ELECTRIC NYAN PONY
14Oh goodness
FUCK YEAH
Yes, my dislike is irrational, I don't know why, but I very much dislike her. It's a lot like people who hate Nyx really
She spent so much time competing with Applejack she came in last place in a race.
Every Pony is best Pony
She almost chickened out of the Best Young Flyer's Comp.
^
>3
>:3
FreezeFrame, but that's the point, she didn't totally fail, in fact, she MORE THAN redeemed herself
I like her because she had a strong hand in the weather.
Edward, what about the STATUE? You didn't counter that fail on her part yet
So? Everypony else who failed did the same.
But Newgate, that applies to every pony in the show? :0
The statue that she broke when she was trying to keep it from falling on everyone else?
That's not on her.
yes, FF
None have any unredeemed mistakes. :0
the statue still broke
She brought it down
I dislike Dash as a character simply because i don't deal well with her pesonality, same for AJ. for fanfics, i'm fine with them, and hell some of the ways i've seen Dash makes her almost attractive of a char, but it's not canon
That's the nature of the show.
also, all the pillars
and Fall Weather Friends? Both AJ and Dash sucked there
0Obai not best pony
It's a bit of a sugarbowl, but it's not the bad kind.
I feel like SilverMane I guess
Oh
Were we arguing?
I'm sorry.

EVERY PONY IS BEST PONY.

0SHE'S NOT BEST PONY, DARI
The biggest theme in the show is that of redemption.
DISCORD IS NOW BEST PONY

@pony unponyiest pony

6 unponyiest pony is 2The 8Wonder2bolts
There was one Tyrant Celestia that I liked, but it was a possessed Celestia
The whole "Banishing for 1000 years" needs to be explained a bit more so celestia redeems herself from that stuff
God, Celestia is so weird to me
Celestia did nothing wrong, she needs no redeeming.
It was a better choice than killing her sister to keep the rest of Equestria from dying.
@pony Edwardnewgate
6 Edwardnewgate is 5Chief Thund11erho15oves
Sometimes I feel like she's a tyrant, other times she's a benevolent Princess
No, I don't disagree
But why 1000 years? :0
I like Trollestia (though not the more extreme versions)
Yeah.
it was meant to be eternity
herospirit: Because that's when the ponies who would be able to purify Luna would show up.
Also, it's a nice round number.
And prophecies love round numbers.
wait, is Barry right?
It wasn't, otherwise there would be no tales of when she'd reappear in 1000 years
The reality is, it pisses me off that Luna apologized, but Celestia didn't
In fact, she acted like she forgave LUna, and did nothing wrong
If you watched episode one, you'd know it was meant to be eternity
Or was it?
It was just that the stars helped Princess Luna escape
OSHIT
Sure, the prophecy said "the stars will aid her escape", but who's to say Celestia didn't set that in motion?
AWW CRAP
It was meant to be forever, but Celestia new she'd escape after 1000 years.
Or at least know about it and allow it to happen.
knew*
There were four stars travelling toward the moon throughout the night during the episode
It was prophecy.
There's a good comic that shows how I feel, Imma find it
Not all prophecies come true, though
Celestia probably started the prophecy.
Because she KNEW it was going to happen.
in fact, the majority of prophecies don't come true
For certain.
With the way Celestia responded to seeing her sister again, I don't think she really could have kept her there forever.
To be quite honest
I thought Celestia was never in any danger in the pilot episodes
Barry: that's an unreliable story Twilight read, though.
or perhaps the prophecy was made by an ancestor of Pinkie's.
SHE'S DIGGIN' UP THE COWNCAL ROWD
Barry: it doesn't even know the princesses's names.
UH OH

It's not the book that doesn't know, but the writer
Everyone dun be gone

HERE'S JOHHNY!

All the various fanfic explanations are awesome, but I'd like to see a canon explanation.
0Tackle her
There's no explanation needed.
Luna went evil.
>BEACON OF LOVE
I just want a better explanation of where the Nightmare came from.
>THE OLYMPIC TORCH
Celestia trapped her for a while instead of killing her.
Discord is the cause for evil, Dari.
:3

we wont get anywhere with this argument until we get more info from S2.
I'm hoping that premiere will have an explanation.

she's Luna, the moon goddess, so she should be wise and knowledgable to a decent extent

*content
EP 1 AND 2 BACK TO BACK
[05:19:02] Dari: 7-9pm ET
[05:19:05] Dari: 2 hours?
[05:19:08] Dari: 1 hour episodes?
[05:19:08] Dari: wut?
WAIT
WUT
1 hour episodes?
OMG OMG OMG
The first two shown back to back when it airs.
The Hub will premiere the second seasons of at least three original series in September. Family Game Night will launch its second season with two back-to-back new episodes on Friday, September 2 from 7-9pm ET.
Fan-favorite and breakout hit My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic will kick off its second season on Saturday, September 17 (time TBA). In the premiere episode “The Return of Harmony – Part 1,” Discord escapes from his stone prison and Twilight and her friends act quickly to find the Elements of Harmony to stop him.
no no, its an encore of the first two episodes
OH MY GOD
dont they already have the elements of harmony?
or is it like a soul quest?
No, its new.
to "find" the elements in their selves?
Ah, it says 3 series will be airing their second series then.
is there a second set of the elements?
So episodes are still the the same length.
dat skype
i thought that after episode two of season 1 they just kept them at their houses or something
Yeah.
son of a bitch! scared the crap out of me.
nah Hunty
I read spoilers
it is MUCH cleverer than that
oh good
dont tell me spoilers
or i will, by celestias mane, beat your ass :D
:D
My g-mail conversation based on the YT trolling has 57 e-mails and counting.
but yeah, how many ponies did celestia imprison?
so, i cant wait for season 3, can you?
/me wonders if Celestia imprisoned Discord (though not sure).
Nah, Luna did.
And a bit of him was trapped in her, which is where NMM came from.
really?
fuck off freeze
you better be speculating
i swear to god
That's my theory until the 17th
i h8 you, m8
ahahah
Owned.
lol
Wing to the FACE!
actually, beak to the face.
More speculation: Pinkie Pie will sing in he 2-parter.
the*
doesnt she sing in every episode (thats pinky heavy)
Not all of them.
Lo all
BATS! BATS ON MY FACE!
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALP

Hiya!
Hey.

Hello, LF

ohai LF

The stream
0...I can't even think of a snide remark to that. grats.
please text him
I hear you are a streamer of considerable stream
I mean, skill
:D
We've got less than a month to get things together
tell him mysql died
god I am derping a lot
or was, rather. Med School just started and I haven't been able to stream for a while
Alright, thanks HP.
12It will be the best night ever. I shall make sure of it.
8right
done!
4Gah, I have to admit, I'm getting pretty damn excited
Sathi should be called our Mane Streamer right now
pfft, HB*
I'll go back to my position when this semester ends, though
Hipster is not Harry Potter.
now*
anyways! Pleasure to meet you, LF
8Hewlett Packard
Typo.
thanks
Hi, Flutters
Herr Potter.
lol the 17th, happy pre-birthday to me, happy pre-birthday to me...
Same here, NewDCD
14Is it bad I'm not as excited as soon as I was kinda expecting something like this already? lol
i wonder if theyll introduce some of their favorite OC ponies as background ponies?
0Livestreaming of S2! Gurren Lagann! Mechs! Fellow bronies! How can it not be the best night ever!?
14*some
PREDATOR
12>Ghostes
9anyways, LF
FIRST EPISODE
S2 4 days before my birthday, i love it
Hey sorry I'm here now
WITH PREDATORS!
9LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS
12>excited
hey
TO DEFEAT
12>wut is this?
i think something is screwey
9THE HUUUUUUUUUUNS
can you look into it?
9in any case
Sure
9my first question is this
On the stream you mean?
14It'll be 6 days before my Birthday. Early Birthday presents. :)
Primeval.
9have you ever used Veemi to stream anything?
/me giggles
Just when I played a touch with it.
9I've heard you are a streamer of considerable skill, bust just checkin'
9I see
watching on megavideo? aww, that means they'll cut you off afteran hour
9so where is your area of expertise? Livestream? uStream? Justin.tv?
8nope, because dari is an internet wizard
Livestream mostly. I'm an extremely quick learner though.
4Haha, I know I know
a winternet
4But I've got internet appearances and reputations to uphold
What do you use to send to the site? The adobe software and multicam?
So... whats up tonight?
9well, you'll mainly need VHScrCap and Adobe FME
0Big news
im baking a cake for my friends birthday right now
9the reason we're choosing this streaming service is due to its unlimited-quality limit as well as unlimited viewers
Besides facinating images of menu searching, I mean.
MAKE A RAINBOW CAKE HUNTY
I have FME for now
/me 4will never confess he felt something stir in him when he was listening to At the Gala upon discovering he'll be available for the premiere of Season 2 among hundreds of fellow fans
Downloading VHSScrCap
9also if you ever knew KevlarMoses last season, you'll remember his Livestream was always getting torn down by trolls
OOOOh thats not a bad idea
Baking a cake? An ordinary cake? Not a cupcake?
9wait, LF
and i know JUST how to make it :D
9you need an older version of VHScrCap
9newer versions have watermark
9and we obviously don't want that
8Ghosties has the weirdest boner right now
9allow me to fetch it
all you gotta do is take a cup of flour add it to the mix
Yeah, the watermarkless edition.
4Not even kidding, I forgot this feeling
already got it :3c
The tragic thing, is, that recipe won't really work so very well...
/me 12took video evidence. Gosties ability to feel human emotion will be revealed to all.
8>Gosties
/me 0was there for it
4GODDAMN PONIES, MAKING ME FEEL AND SHIT
1.0.44.0
i know, but i need to stop at teh groceries later
and grab rainbow cake mix, its ready in a dash
9oh http://dl.dropbox.com/u/100533/VHSC_inst.exe
I had no idea Brony State broadcasted this late
9ah well
/me 0was using white text when he saw Ghosties "feeling"
What show is this, by the way?
9in any case
It's not late =p
12@Hipster, I am contractually obligated to misspell Ghostes name every time he is mentioned.
9I'll teach you advanced techniques right from the go
its not even 4 yet?
9but first
not late at all
4It's late for me, I've got class at 9:30 AM
9setting up VHScrCap
You signed that?
9first, open FME
A few minutes before midnight for me =P
hell you can still buy hard liquor right now
1 AM here.
at least he isn't spelling it Goatees
4Indeed
ahah
8>Shosties
im not sure i like this show
Toasties?
0>Boasties
8>Goatses
roasties?
Post Taosties?
14Three little Ghosties sitting on posties eating buttered toasties
>Mosties
14That is something from a school paper I'll never forget.
4*the entire chat has turned into rhyming my name*
Ain't it a shame?
Alright. Have it looking at the multicam now too.
14HAH
/me 4does not give a single fuck, Season 2 is actually coming.
14THE GAME
dat nokia ringtone
Eeyup
Why not just make the mosties of the game, Ghosties?
And season 2! *inhales* yay...
What show is this?
soooo miggle at the mosties, riggle at the rosties
Outnumbered.
9roger
9you'll notice Adobe FME's CPU consumption is similar to Procaster's
I'm looking through my Diff. Eq. tests, and realized suddenly that I must have destroyed the final
wtf m8
what are we watching
Because my grades were 98, 85, and 89, but I got a full A
nice
okay
Joy to the curve.
yeah
Hugh Dennis.
Nope, no curve
Yay.
makes sence
Oh?
LOL
Yeah, the 98 would make an average of 90...
AHAHAHAHA
>the girl in 5J posted bits of dead badger to the prime minister
91
That is brilliant. XD
I definitely got at least a 95, then
14Wut
Since the final is just a double test
Oh, right
Forgot that bit of math department policy
9now
Lowest test grade is ignored.
4If the slogan for Sept. 17th on Brony State isn't "I can't believe we're finally here. With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this the best night ever!" Ghosties will strangle a cunt
9open that please
YES
Irefuse to wear a dress to that event.
Is that a challenge Ghosties?
Trololo.
4Fucker, I'll stab you dari
Ghosties, you're oging to... strangle a cunt?
ill wear a dress if that happens
Such language.
8i will wear a dress, i dont even give a fuck
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN
4I will eat your intestines like noodles
/me goes shopping for dresses in his size
It's wierd
XD
Hmm
fuck the royal guards?
/me 12readies his wardrobe. His gala dress could use some work.
I'll try restarting
>Oh he's good
8why such anger, shosties?
>hide food under cushion
8this is a happy occasion
No, you're just really bad.
4I am happy
:P
I'll wear my best formal attire for it.
/me 14searches out Rarity for a slick dress
Which would be my kilt.
/me 0wonders what Boomboxs wear for formal occasions
4I'm just being me about it :3
eyup.
I don't have a dress, but I could wear a nice suit or something :P
You know what Equestria hasn't invented yet? The miniskirt. Twilight and Fluttershy in miniskirts. Turn the planet upside down.
i was gonna wear my medic uniform
ohai

Sumica!
I'm about to go. . .
Hi Dashite

I need to shower. I was just doing a favour for Sumica, but it seems he's here now, so he can do it.
oh.
uh okay. I'll be back later.

I see, went to go grab a drink and came back to everything being bugged out.

same here.
It looks like mibbit is working again
:O
woop
lots of channels back up already
Lawl
Does this mean my ban is lifted from here? XD
...
Possibly.
:O
XD
Back up?
well, you know what I mean.
Not really .:P
... it is?
as in it connects to epic-chat?
back on the network again.
yep.
The channels don't exist until someone joins them.
:P
I tested it
oh, right, the mib_ users. duh. i just noticed those
yeah, that's what I meant.
Everyone rejoined quick
Oh.
Well I have autojoins set up.
I just didn't word it right I guess.
oh.
So when I connect my channels are joined automaticlly.
:3
huh, whenever i try to connect to either irc.epic-chat.net or ssl.epic-chat.net, it fails >.>
I need to set that up on mine.
From mibbit or your client?
my client
what would mibbit do differently?
It connects the shaymin server atm.
>implying ssl.epic-chat.net exists?
I kicked my own mib :P
HA-ha
>[06:45] -> [Polarfire] FINGER
Just fingered Polarfire.

It's an IRC CTCP.
It's ok from you, dari.

/me wonders what keeps setting that morse code thing off...
i find that any more than 7 in a sex party makes things awkward
js
umm, no coltcoddle
haha
ofcorse 7 is awkward need even numbers =p
nope :D
7 is perfect
ugh
Hah! No voice for mod!
>implying daisy chain?

ohai octavia
Aw...
Heyyas
gadday ocavia
14Oops, colors. :P
*octavia
courtisy reach around eh?
14Hey Hunty
hi
OHAI!
interested in sex party?
Dammit this is the main channel, not the shipping channel!
shipping implies emotional involvment
sex party has no emotion, just sex party
sex =/= love
see
Casual sex.
>_>
>implying shipping requires romance
> impliying romance require emotion
Where is that Pegacorn x Bjornfot...
oh right hey hunty expect one hell of a back log if you ever come back to skype.
Yes, where?
D;
why sumica WHY!?! no realy why?
I dunno, but I'm pretty sure it disproves hunty's arguement. :p
hey, so does anybody ever talk in #epic-chat or #staff ?
seems like they'd know what's going on
If your back log is less than 1000 messages I'll be disappointed.
Cause you been gone from it for 3 days hunty and we been using that same chat the whole time.
i havent been onnline for a couple of days because i read all the Happy luna contest story
Dari: agreed.
*storys
I had someone disappear for a chat for 4 days. They came back to over 8000 new messages. :D
Sumica: ...huh?
only like 7 of the 60 some odd ones were actually happy

whats your favorite Gmod?
:D
I like IRC a lot. And to think I couldn't have even told you what it means 2 and a half months ago.
Is anyone here a non-closet brony on facebook?
i am
Mind putting a word in for us?
oh
People asking about anyone live streaming S2
i wanna be the brony best
i g2 join group first :P
And none of the mods are able to at the moment. XD
like no one ever was
how would one go about doing such a feat?
yay i got approved
Just say that we'll be livestreaming the episodes as they air, maybe drop the site name, though that could change as we get a domain.
maybe drop the site name? don't i want to link it here? or link to their FB?
Let me ask.
That is bound to see a sizable increase in visitors here.
>mfw mods are all closetbronies
14I'm not. But I dont like Facebook. :P
[07:13:20] Hipster Brony: just that we will be streaming the pony eps live, and give them a link
ah
You might want to put that we could be moving domain soon.
not .co.cc?
To .net
Maybe.
<3 i just realized, these ponies drive me to emote
and why does everyone kill off ranibow dash?!?
wtf fanfic
wtf
hunty: Because of how loved she is.
Not to metion that her death usually makes the most sense with her whole "rush into the danger ahead of everypony" personality.
If you want to affect someone with a death, it has to be a loved character.
bastards play with my emotions!?!?
it taint fair
OH YEAH

I WANNA BE THE VERY BT

14i cant hear shit.
MFW no one tells me no sound.
>_>
:P
14There it is
14:P
14Oh jeez, this again. lol
holyhell that startled the hell out of me. Was off in another tab.
ahahehehawheha
that was fun! whats next?
please say bingo! please say bingo!
Why do I keep re-reading fics I know will make me bawl my eyes out?
I dunno.
: /
Because you're weird.
14Weird is cool though.
14All the cool kids are doing it~
because its the normal thing to do
inb4 hipster :P
freezeframe
14What did you say Daz?
normal sucks i hate normal
lets get..."weird" bby
ahahah
14I know that :P
14Nevermind, just saw I think. lol
you and your welsh sounding self
ahahahahahah
a bit
14lol
ahahahaha
LOOOOLL that's NOT welsh
tolololo
You might sound Welsh, I dont know what one sounds like.
Ah, right. It's because I like reading things that do affect me.
uh so about that FB post for Bronystate - tell me should I change anything?
AW YEEEE
And Shower of Stars is definitely in that category.
Looks good to me, none of the other mods commented in Skype.
oof those purple bedroom eyes
14I think it looks good too.
14Covered more than I thought it would, which is good. Very nice.
14"Very nice" /Borat
Oh God, Borat. I hate that film.
14Haha
14I love the movies that guy does
14Hilarious.
14Bruno too
It's one of the films that all your peers will love.
I just tell them "No, GTFO".
I think having both military and police family (though they were lucky and none died in the line) makes the epilogue hit harder.
that's good to hear
yay thanks Octavia :3
oh wow. What did I walk in on?
dont blink, dont look away.
14You're welcome. :)
Who posted that clown video last night?
14lol Sumica
I think it was light night.
...what? clown video?
I feel compelled to replay it.
Ohhh.
You'll see.
uhh, Dashie- why are you he-... 0__0
Then you'll feel as though you've been raped.
:P
14RD... NO! YOU WILL NOT TRICK ME WITH YOUR EVIL POWERS!
...wat
14OH GOD
Oh I know that meme
/me feels like he's being molested
14I AM 12 AND WHAT IS THIS!
this makes me happy
that came from a bug on the goldeneye game on the N64
OH MY GOD
14I'm scared to go to bed now....

Bai all, i g2g to someplace, is why i'm up so early. Be back soon
Damn, Spike is cool in series 2.

*cute
who else has had a pony dream?
dont be shy
Nope.
Nope
I don't remember dreams.
hey what is the command for halfop?
14I've had one or two appearances I think. Still waiting on a full pony dream though.
lies
I haven't remembered a dream for at least 2 years.
except for octavia
I don't remember them either. I just can't. don't know why.
i had a pony dream two days ago
14:P
and i hung out with luna and rainbow dash
....
why did i have to wake up?
A lucid pony dream would suck anyway.
The closest I've come is some vague pony related thoughts while hoving in that stage between sleep and waking up in the morning.
jealous.
it was AMAZING
of the pony dream.
That would just be a reminder that it's not real.
:P
omg rainbow dash is just what you think she would be
AWESOME
awww......
Well of course she is just what you think she would be.
She only exists in your thoughts.
>Dashite used logic. it's super effective
you watch your poisonous logical tongue
:p
We dont take kindly to that brand of logic around here.
sumica is right
i feel a rabble commming on
RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE
I think I had a pony-related dream a couple weeks ago, but I don't remember anything about it.
Harry Hanrahan <3
omg nikolas cage loses his shi
Yes
Yes you are
Lux Aeturna makes this perfect
That song is way over used.
fuck mexico!
exactly. it's such a cliche trailer music, which makes it perfect
How have we not had a Nicolas Cage movie yet?
>moustachio'd cage
wut
inb4 falcon punch
ardiago for strings or some such is't it?
We had kickass.
Kickass doesn't count.
pedobear is pissed.
dosnt count
Cage was a side character.
bees.....
NOT
THE
BEEEESSSSSS
B'S!
14NOT THE BEES!
BEEEES
why doesnt he close his mouth?
14THEYRE IN MY EYES!
i don't even know what movie that is
at the bees?
The Wickerman
The Village?
wickerman
ah
It's a crappy film.
Not Village, what am I thinking of...
very crappy
14I like the Wickerman :(
I've never even seen it, but I've watched that clip sooo many times.
It's a really bad film. :P
14Oh bleh.
And once again I have to question my perceptions of Octavia...
If you like it other than for comical purposes, I'm surprised.
14I'm not even sure why I like it.
14I just do.
Lawl
14The newer one.
Weird.
14Theres an older one.
Yeah.
14But it was boring as hell.
The new one is just...Really bad though.
14How so?
Watched it on TV with my family.
We wanted our time back.
lol.
14I mean, its certainly not a blockbuster.
14But still.
all right, sleep time.
Night.
14G'night
I should probably sleep too. School and all >_>
but.....
Aww.
I don't want to keep you up.
oh XD
If you've gotta go and get some sleep that's fine. <3
I was nowhere near close.
lol.
Sleep? Boo!
What happened to sleep being for the weak?!
14lol
I slept like 3 hours before my first day back.... If stay up all night tonight I'm going to die.
On the other hand.....
fuck it. I'll sleep when I'm dead.
If you are going to sleep, you should give me admin first.
What was that?
14:P
ban?
14LOL
14Haha
XD
Lawl, trololo.
nice version of the can can
14Polar is trolling hard.
oh, that Prince Trollarfire
Prince? >_>
Someone needs to get his hearing checked. :p
Sorry, Princess Trollarfire
14^
oh wait, I've got a good one,
aww forgot the reason.
14lol
and that was the good part,
I forgot the reason XD
14Poor Dashite lol
oh well.
and then Dashite was a mute
14XD
Oh
:p
14Everything was bigger and 8.
what was the reason? you gotta share!
5 minutes and then I can see how many people on my friends list had Deus Ex preloaded...
My favorite one...
Confound these videos they drive me to convulsions.
dashite is a good name
as long as you don't interpret 'da' as a separate word
14But at least they are happy convulsions
14....
14LMAO
aww yeah, the mare who arranges the blocks
ask for admin? banis luna
Ah this one.
...or man, as it were
14Dem blocks
Oh
ohai Daz

sorry dashite
14lol
You aren't sorry at all and you know it. :p
Seems the bank's still closed. Keep me entertained, Dari! =D and ohai GGgala.

I am, that time XD
I really did forget
:P

14I made a Trixie. But since I dont have a printer currently, I had to hand cut and color the pieces. >:|
>mum asks if I want to her to ponies for me
>say nah I want to see the awkward moment when the cashier asks "So...Who's this for", and I say "Me"

<Dashite> Sorry, Princess Trollarfire
....
WTF dari your mum's amazing!!!! so tell me!! tell me your pony buying stories
Just saw that.
14LOL

I thought that was why you banned him, Polarfire!
I thought that's why you kicked me in the first place. :p
Haven't bought any from a shop yet, going out to get some tomorrow.
HERDMIND
nah. that was for the lulz.
well, and that too I guess.

1 person in Deus Ex so far...
14OH WOW
14I had the steeam muted
:D
14But I love this PMV and song!
Lawl.
6...
Well you missed it.
:P
that person must have a fast system Dashite to decode the game that fast.
14Ah, well, I ripped it anyway. :P
:( muted
the cutie mark that I get?
dari are you not taking requests? or are you playing a playlist atm?
One other person who is about to get on it.
I heard the music, and I had to come back for this.
also i was woudnering if you could play the playlist of garysmod so we could all view here and judge them
Oh, wasn't paying attention, didn't realise anyone had requested.
hmm
Sure you want that Daz some of them are bad.
14I was just watching the Garrys Mod entries, thats why I had the stream muted. :P
ok Sumica nvm
still, my request earlier was this epic PMV: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1PJqihWhgc
^_^
6...wtf adotube?
lol orbatal death
What is this song?
MFW I just typoed please instead of sleep
lol u so tired
Maybe I should go and get some sleep. XD
6...why is there adotube on the page?
6...that I can't close?
What's adotube?
6There's a stupid little video ad.
Hmm
6Only on this page.
6That I CAN'T CLOSE.
Lawl
Hey Dari what was the name of that last one?
The last one, as in the one were Luna nukes ponyville?
The epic one?
where*
God damn.
Oh yeah, Sprinkles. Been meaning to ask, since S2 date is so close, the traffic light system for the rooms.
the video before the one currently up
How were you planning to carry it up?
...
out*
I can't brain today, I has the dumb.
lol
"MLP FIM Fanfic"
Is the title.
...
Dude, I hate my comp sometimes.
Sprinkles, did you get what I said?
WTF IS WITH THIS AD?
D:
And no.
14Winning!
Oh yeah, Sprinkles. Been meaning to ask, since S2 date is so close, the traffic light system for the rooms.
How were you planning to carry it out?
Epic Winning
traffic...light...system...?
...
You die again Sprinkles?
My God.
Did you get my message THIS time?
...apparently the ad is only on the dinkypage.
14lol
6Yeah, I did.
dari will you play 'the cutie mark that I get'?
Thanks Dari
6TF AD?
...
What now? XD
3rd time im ust request? >_<
6There's an AD.
still there?
6On my PAGE.
oh.
D:
Teh horror
the cutie mark that I get http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1PJqihWhgc
YAYYYYYYY
6That has NO close option.
<3
6And WON'T go away.
Quick! kill it with fire!
trumpet pinkie best pinkie
damnit i thought you were playing the digimon movie
So Sprinkles?
lol hunty
Eugh, digimon.
:P
dari
I used to have a digimon game on PS1.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaages ago.
im not a violent man
but...
DIGIMON RUMBLE ARENAAAAA
and i had that game too
Pokemon > Digimon
Digimon world or something.
i could never get the freaking egg
6I was hoping you could script something... =/ We could do it manually, but it would require resaving the code every time we change the light.
digimon rumble arena only good one
and dari i will fight you mate
pokemon's good
pokémon *
Yeah, I've got some ideas.
6Which would be a BITCH.
so what's this traffic light?
None are without fault though, and they depend on how the frontend room selection bit works.
Doesn't matter Daz.
You'll see.
6Honestly, just an admin CP script where we could click to change the light once logged in would be cool by me.
so it does matter >_<
/me wishes he knew what went down / kept in the loop. feelsbadman
still, THIS PMV <3
6That way we don't have to worry if we feel like raising/lowering the light limits.
I was thinking.
A bot that's in all the rooms.
CP script? light limits? is it ... viewer limits?
Deposits people in the room with the least people.
:P
6I don't like that idea and you know it.
6I know.
so there ARE gonna be multiple rooms for streaming!! Oh god please mods make sure i can still be with my bros
traffic lights... light dims..... CP scripts......
6I just don't like the idea of auto-deposit.
Why?
superconfused
6*points to what Daz just said*
request http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkF5DMAerAo
That's why DCD and I came up with an idea.
6Auto-deposit kills that.
and uh. pointing at me? :O
We also have a room which is user unlimited but messages are throttled.
Oh. I know what this has to do with.
Igetitnow
whut is it Polarfire ?
So you're in both a room with limited people and unlimited talking and the reverse.
Best of both worlds.
6User unlimited but messages throttled? Ew.
but but but if multiple rooms how will I make sure I'm with all my fwiends?
They're talking about how to distribute the viewers among the different rooms once S2 starts up
Well if we use your system how will it work anyway?
Unless friends get together.
couldn't you do something so some people could have rooms for them? reserved or maybe just let us join? cuz frieeeeends
And decide they are all going to go in one room.
6And it would deposit them there.
but then pepole may get split up :(
Problem is, Dash room will be full of people.
6If the friends aren't there, they can go to a different page.
^
Other rooms get left empty.
on the dash room.
instafull.
rooms after ponies? way to split us up ;___;
6We've discussed this to hell and back.
6First come first serve, dude.
inb4 silvershipper becomes livestream channel for the regulars :(
Yeah, but mods in the Dash room are gunna get raped.
o god.
ooooooo THATS y more mods are needed!
6...there's a limit, they wouldn't.
:P
6And if one room is that over crowded and the others aren't, the mods can move to watch that room as needed.
inb4 3 Apple Fritter, One Snips and One Ace room.
The only way to stop people from joining the room is to lock the room.
6I really have thought this through, quite a bit.
With either a key, or invite only channel mode.
soooo that's why more mods are needed. i guess it's the next logical step in expanding bronystate, and I see that SirSprinkles but i just hope ii can still be with all my friends
There's also a user limit mode.
But.
hmm
I'm not sure how well that'll work.
why not testrun it at some point midweek?
sure there'll be less people, but still
6>midweek
6There'd be nopony to test run it with?
yea
"sure there'll be less people, but still"
There's usually 30 people max midweek.
y u no type while looking at chat
6Yeah, nopony.
rally the troops.
>>>>"sure there'll be less people, but still"
scramble the legions.
you can test out your keys and invites and shiz
Anyway.l
The system isn't sorted yet.
So no.
k
So, important first.
again, requesting http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkF5DMAerAo :P
:P
14Still a bit of the ways off to being able to test it
How would the frontend work for you?
You can select each room.
To join the one you want.
6The lights system would be fairly easy to set up, as would room selection.
By doing what?
i guess i'm gonna have to use skype and steam more to make sure i'm with my buddies
6They choose what room, and are directed to that page.
will there be more than 6 rooms? (mane6 :P)
And how do we make sure the rooms are kept at even numbers of users?
14I guess since I probably wont have RD, I want my sweet Flootahshai
6...that's why we could raise/lower the limits.
either don't let rooms with too large numbers compared to others be joined, or just, as SirSprinkles said, move mods around
And the traffic lights work how?
6If it gets close to a limit, we change the light, if it hits the limit, we change it to red.
6And if we raise/lower the limit, the lights would still work.
i agree...
>_< you're just messing with us discussing it here aren't you
14Ah, I see now.
So you change the lights manually?
6Which is why I'd prefer an admin CP.
6Yes, manually with an admin CP.
That seems like a lot of work especially as we'd the limits on the channels themselves would be changing all the time.
6Automatically would mean having to change the coding every time we changed the limits.
That sounds like a lot or coordination to adjust those all the time.
oh.
6An admin CP isn't that much work...
what dari said
6At all.
....
Imma just shutup now.
6From what I understand.
an administrator control panel wouldn't be that hard to make, so do eet
6And we'd be watching to see when we're getting close to the rooms being mostly full, and if most of the rooms are getting high, we'd raise the limits.
6We really wouldn't need to raise/lower limits unless we gained/lost a lot of viewers at once.
If we're doing this your way, I'm definitely making EVERYTHING automatic other than room selection.
Otherwise this is gunna be a trainwreck.
I guarrantie it.
6That's fine, I suppose.
although you guys discussing it here with us is sorta just messing with us >_<
gurantee*
6Just make it so that if it's within 50 of the limit, it turns yellow.
14It sounds like a bit of work, but I'm sure it can be streamlined a bit.
and dari r u unable to chat and take requests? requesting :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkF5DMAerAo
6And if it hits, it turns red.
Just for curiosity sake. How many people are you guys expecting for this first stream?
6And if the channel is closed, it's grey.
14Dont we usuaully get around 300 these days? Though after that last plug and such, might go up a bit.
So when a channel is at the limit.
And the traffic light is red.
14Especially after S2
Does the room get disabled?
6Yes, though we could do it just before the limit.
oh wow those x's
6The room isn't disabled.
6It just can't be joined.
The button
6Since it's at limit.
what about, SirSprinkles, those who like to stay here 24/7 just to have a space? (looking at you, people who stay here even when afk :P)
To take you to the room.
6It could be, yeah.
Octavia: especially during s2
6People here that are afk extremely early will be kicked out of fairness to others.
14Well, I meant after it airs Daz. :P
6We'll do a callout before kick, though.
ofc Octavia, and uh ok then SirSprinkles i guess that could work
idlti
Do the traffic lights update live?
i dont like that idea D;
but you could also just block all rooms other than standard ones (like maybe bronystate) until preshow?
then at preshow open up the rooms?
Or do you have to refresh the page to see?
ahah, umm, ignore me :D
6Yes, dari.
(solves afk problem without mass kicking)
6Live would be nice.
6If possible.
Actually, the cleverer people are just gunna see the traffic lights are pointless, and camp the room they want to get into by spamming /join room into their client.
6The rooms will be opened as needed, Daz.
6That's why the limit, dari.
i just thought opening them during preshow, rather than always, would solve a lot of kick hassle
6If it's full, then they can't join.
What's to stop people joining multiple rooms?
6A bot to monitor nicks.
Hostnames would be better.
or hostmanes
6Or, more preferably, IP.
14I'll be sad I wont be able to talk to every single person watching the stream. lol
and will mods have access to all the rooms?
6You will.
6Mods will have access to all rooms at once.
you will? i'm not a mod :P
14Ah, okay.
6And won't count towards the limit.
just wondering, cuz then ppl like Octavia can chat, AND if more ppl in a room, mod is already there for modding
14I thought I would be assigned to a specific room.
>won't count towards the limit
Not possible using the channel limit.
mode
6i.e. If we want 200 bronies, we set the limit to 213, since 13 mods.
for 10 mods
not hard :P
/me plays his own videos for the time being : /
6Yeah, just however mods are at the stream, add to the limit.
yea
But then those get filled up when not in use.
oh.
Bot has to know how many mods are at the stream.
dem sevens
in preshow just get mods to join all channels or something
6Just make it count OPs in the mod channel.
if mods leave / turn up late, then that may be a problem if a room is full and it's not got a mod who wants to be there
6Or just count the mod channel.
Problem with not auto-delegating rooms.
A lot of problem might just keep trying the room they want until they get in.
i've been meaning to ask: why does my browser always say it's 'show time!' ?
Meaning that even though the other rooms aren't full no one's using them.
Because a lot of people are just trying to get into one room.
And no one will want to join a currently empty room.
6...they'd have to wait forever to get in if that was the case.
that's going to happen if you're planning to expand bronystate.
I just think that manual throws up a lot more problems than auto.
That was kind of the point of the room with everyone in.
6And we'd lower the limit and ask people to join another room to get people in the other room.
So people are connected to everyone, their friends, etc, whatever.
Lower the limit when the room is already full?
darp
6Yeah, so then people would leave the room.
They don't have to though.
The limit in this room is 3.
Are we just gunna kick random people out?
loool
That seems a bit unfair.
you might have to forve them if that is the case.
6Make Magnet kick them from the room when the join a new one.
6Instead of kicking out of the new room.
Well you could be splitting up friends then.
hopefully the ylisten
Which was the whole point of manual in the first place.
6...then they'd move to the new room.
6privmsg is a lovely thing.
Well you could say the same thing for auto?
thats a lot of work.
They can still msg each other.
if you know how to use it =p
to pm all those people
6Auto would be annoying though.
Mods are going to be seriously tied up.
6And we'd still have people trying to join the room they want.
i understand how all of you feel, and you each have valid points, so it shouldnt be too hard to compormise
Polarfire: i think that's why they're still looking for more?
I think manual is just gunna cause trouble, especially with some rooms being more popular than others.
6If it happens to cause trouble, we'll work out the kinks, dude.
sadly might have to ask forcfully.
If you say so. :/
so why not test this thing out, by setting room limits to like 4 or 5, and leaving bronystate open for us all, during the week?
rainbow dash would be full all the time
yeah, not as fun, but a whole lot less trouble.
6...because that would be bad, Daz.
[08:49] <hunty> rainbow dash would be full all the time
^
And the other rooms would be catching up slower.
...how SirSprinkles ? it's a test, with regulars who won't leave due to derps in new system, and if bronystate is open, we can all discuss :3
IE if you need people to populate a new room ask them to move then after a bit move them?
6And you all say that like EVERYPONY love rainbow.
.....
...
6The split is actually fairly even.
...
LOL
ok. Aj vs. rainbow room.
cant decide
6Rainbow would win.
6I'm not saying Rainbow wouldn't have more.
Which ever one has the people that I want to talk with in it.
6I'm saying Rainbow wouldn't have a COLLOSSAL FUCKTON more.
But it's like chat and oat on ponychan.
I dunno man.
pinkie pie vs fluttershy+marshmellows
All the people shift to the more popular one.
Rainbow's pretty popular.
Rainbow might not have vastly more to start with, but it'd quickly get known as the most popular and best room.
Because it always has the most people.
^
So most people would want to be their.
6Doesn't make it best.
>_< SirSprinkles why not test it? rather than spend hours discussing, test in minutes, real men don't think they act! besides, midweek daprs rathern than S02 EP01 darps are MUCH much better imo
there*
My poor brain.
;___;
XD
6It would be tested by then.
I dunno, numbers are gunna be so large then nothing can really prepare for it. :/
6We'll test it long before then.
oohhh well that clears stuff up
now you tell me you're testing it before hand ^_^
in a crowded room its hard to talk
To be honest.
Chat probably won't be that important.
so it might be popular for a while, but people might filter into less populated rooms for discussion
As long as it's there, because people will be watching a NEW pony episode.
?
6People will migrate to the rooms they like, and the people they like. And newbies are more likely to make friends quickly based off liking the same ponies.
6This has been discussed.
sorry
was reading TCB
I'm gunna troll the room I'm in because Dash is best pony.
6And again, troubleshooting.
And they'll all like a different pony.
Trololo.
6>room you're in
6You mean all of them?
6Or the room you'd be the mane mod in?
Yeah.
14All the above. lol
well, not gonna troll dash room with 'dash best pony' is he?
6>multiple choice question
6>answers as if yes or no
You can decide what you want from my answer.
:P
>British
xD xD
It's whatever you want it to be. ;2,15)
Oh well, we'll do your system. If it's a trainwreck, not my fault.
:P
so mod room is gonna just be spamed to death seeing all rooms?
6Mod room won't see all rooms. IRC doesn't work that way.
completely left field idea, but what if you have a buerocratic system where they have to fill out information in order to obtain internet cards to be allowed in the room :D
6Mod room is for us to discuss.
14If it did though...
14My mantra would be "quicker than the speed of light!"
lol
6OH GAWD DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.
just get more mods and you'l be fine modding all the rooms at once
6We already have 13 mods.
6For 6 initial rooms.
14Yeah, we're getting up there.
I'll have a bot make sure all rooms stay within 20 users of each other.
6Realisitically we'd still need more, but not many.
and 6 rooms? so 2 ish per room + you can jump around? sounds fine already
14I joke that soon we'll have more mods than viewers in the off days. :P
6Sounds good to me, dari.
especially considering you can jump around rooms
thats an uneven number, not even divisible by more than 2 you need at least 19 or a mod will get overworked :D
6If one gets to be over 20 higher, make it yellow. If it's over 30 higher, make it red.
but, you know, you can just ignore me, thats for the best, "squeek"
6Since 30's not a ton more.
6>19
6TF are you talking about?
Hmm
Traffic lights could be XML driven flash I suppose.
But meh.
That's for automatic.
6Would be fine by me.
Welp, now I have a shitload of stuff to do.
ahahah, dont pay attention to me, i dont know wtf im talking about :D
Well, does it?
um.
Is it supposed to?
beyond the literal?
pinky :D
i love that picture daz :D
Hmm
That's all?
idk what else to say daz
its a pinky hybrid robot
and its awesome
4thlink failed
but uhm
its making me happy :D
I'm gonna get down to the point: you didn't draw these did you?
ahem,
i did not, but i like them :D
Hmm
im going to go draw something now
Going now. bie a..
later daz
Cya.
14Night Daz
dari! what should i draw
Dash being awesome.
:P
draw a blank
im going to draw rainbow dash riding on the batcycle but with a tron rainbow going out after it
Awesome.
isnt it though :D
6Windows Update is making me restart my comp. brb
i just realized that i cant draw, i will however make a rainbow dash hoodie
im good at that kind of thing :D
Cool.
now i just need a hoodie, 2x4 piece of wood, paint, dye, bleach, bonding agents and a blow drier
14Oh, some of these Garrys Mod entries are hilarious.
6Jeez Sethisto... slow down.
14"And the Bronies will be like sloooooow dooooooown... And you'll throw ponies in their face with your energy posting!"
6That took you forever to say.
6Octavia, did you decide on what you want for your section of About Us?
14Sorry, I'm kinda puttering around all over the place, so I'm a bit slow to respond atm. Well, I just havent decided on favorite movie.
14I have a pic for myself too. Guess I could send it to ya via Skype at some point.
You know, it might help if someone were to take +m off the channel...

Ohai people
...That took a while
Um, so why'd that happen?
About 6 hours or so I'm guessing?
Also you owe me a "nighty night," Dashite :P
ha...!
14 hours I count
Polarfire was the first one back in so he grabbed Admin status.
The IRC server.
Hi guys
Sup Barry
Ah okay
Why do I owe you a nighty night?
RobotPinkie, my timezone buddy. How are ya?
You told me you didn't have time yesterday, Dashite :P
As I told Daz, I'm doing a run through of OoT with a special cheat active
Hey Daz, I'm doing pretty good. How u?
Two cheats *
whatever, Daz
heh
And then Polarfire decided to +m gave everyone voice and then logged off before unmuting the channel...
two special cheats
I'm great myself, thanks for asking, RobotPinkie
Oh right!
You'll have to wait till tonight. :p
hmm?
I can't exactly wish you good night when it's not night time. :p
Aw... Son, I am disappoint :P
The first is one which makes any damage Link takes lethal. The second is infinite bottled fairies. That's just for the first run through, though
Mfw my senior picture is cancelled because of the earthquake -___-
hello
Oh wow, Barry. Working up to a hardcore run?

depends if you take LATIN or GREEK so both count actually
Why is everthing bigger and 8?
barry's right!
EdwardNewgate: because 7 8 9
(dat children's joke)
then nontuple, dectuple.... and what after that?
The joke is why is 6 afraid of 7?

Rebic?
I just like to twist them
He just mistyped it, I'm sure
But...
But E is on the opposite side of the keyboard from U...
If that's true, it just proves even bots can make mistakes
I dunno, so's the C compared to K
Down below he also typed Rubic's
I just always assume it's a mistake.
Well, next time it might be Reebok's cube :P
lol :p
lol I dunno, he normally doesn't spell things completely wrong, does he?
oh hey it works
ohai NewDCD
Suddenly NewDCD in civilian colors
Hi NewDCD

Ah okay
This chat needs livening up... http://youtu.be/P4TedkQP_hM

SHOO BE DOO
It's alive! IT'S ALIVE!
Gah, Applejack's voice is just AWEFUL
In G1?
I guess, at least in that video
lol yeah, it kinda is.
All the voices were pretty bland.
Her voice was so gravelly
She sounds kinda like my grandma...
Then I probably wouldn't want to hear your grandma talk
She's been dead for decades so that'd just be scary.
Though zombies are, in fact, awesome.
Skeletons are better...
Skeletons riding spiders are even better than that, though
But skeletons riding on spiders Twilight Sparkle and Big Mac having sex is best
lolwat?
Oh that's right, script for S2E1 leaked
SAY WHAT?
I hadn't read it yet, damn your spoilers!
wut?
I have no clue :P
Did they really leak the script though?
I dunno, at least the plot leaked
...that sounds wrong...
mfw
The story has been leaked somehow, I'm not going to read about it, though.
I won't either, unless I'm really bored
Only 25 days left until we get to see it for reals!
Also, is House gonna be streamed today?
EdwardNewgate: Sathi said it'd start at 3:30 Eastern
It's 3:40 now, so...
Ah, I see. I was just curious
Oh, so probably fairly soon, then.
Aye
And the conclusion to TotalBiscuit's latest "Hyper WTF is" just came out, nice.
Torchlight 2 is looking pretty good.
oh fuck, it's a three parter, not the conclusion then...
THREE parter?
Feels good when I can walk to the bathroom with my headset on and not give a fuck or stop listening to pony music
not the game, the video.
Oh, that makes more sense
He's providing commentary with two developers.
And I love having a wireless headset too, AllisZero, it's very handy
Need to hang up my laundry, be back in a bit.

I got an Irc client on my phone
Just to keep up with this chat
Obssession much
I had a lot of trouble with Barinade in this run through
Fun fact, I have no idea how to operate it. My Irc experience is minimal
0,14H7e8y 3R9a11i4n7B8r3o9D11a4s7h
How many times has he done this?
Gimme a minute and I'll check.
alliszero
are you on droid?
Only 9 times so far.
Not right now, no, but yes
ah
Ah cool, what IRC client did you get on your phone? :D
AndChat
So, to keep with whoever was doing it before... *nonuplefacehoof*
4.5 stars and over 100k downloads, seems alright
mmmmfair
:D
He didn't start right away. I think He was in Octuple.
has dari been here at all?
I continued where he left off, is what I did
aside from fleetingly un-breaking the IRC
?
HAI
Hey.
dari
What's wrong with the IRC
;____;
I can't identify me
It dieded
auhasnagad
right.
Oh, Rainbrodash, you know you just said "yes" in Japanese, right?
Hai is the japanese word for yes
Hai!
Sou desu ka?
So dari are we gonna bother re-distributing the half ops and ops and stuff, or gonna wait till we move to a new server soon?
I can only conclude that OHAI is then equal to OH YES!

Dunno.
/me sneaks around once more...
Dari likes being only op
I'll probably just relocate somewhere else.

0Man, he is quick at trying to get back in
It's an autojoin.
but driving for 13 hours through places like Vegas with no AC really takes it out of you

Auto rejoin on kick.

So he's being autojoined and auto-kicked consequtively
0Wait, so we have no topic?

Eeyup.
Anyone can change the topic.
man, he's putting bjornfot to shame

There is one way he can stop. He has to close the window

If you have either it doesn't kick.

0Dari isn't a person, he's an idea.

so, why isn't the server asking me to identify myself
of course...now you've reminded me I STILL have unpacking to do...you whore
Because the server is derped
ah
0Myeah.
is that why i got booted last night around 1 am (15 hours ago)
Yes
ah
We all got booted yesterday
well at least i have an excuse for tinkerbelle

Yup
Yep, that is the scheduled date for season 2 episode 1.
who wants the job of telling my parents that i'm dropping out of my current school, applying to a different one for a totally different field, joining the military, that I like ponies, and that I am, in fact, completely straight
is anyone else slightly concerned about the episode details for it?
Hopefully Adelphia has The Hub

0Silvermane By military do you mean armed services or ROTC?
10kk silvermane, wait, so you want me to neglect to mention the MM pony stuff, yeah? ;D
armed services. i'm too old (not really interested in) ROTC
10ValtheJean yeah what about it, I mean. Like, I didn't notice anything too particularly worrying
MM... does that mean male on male, majora's Mask, or something to do with the military?
10heh
(PM for Dashite's sake)
i'd prefer that RainBroDash, but if you did, i'd have to mention that you are my bitch, and that i got turned into a chick, banged a lesbian, turned male again, then knocked her up
Wouldn't you like to know...
10kk valthejean
10Silvermane you knocked her up? Oh shit how much of this RP have I missed?O_O
oh, that's not canon. yet
Silvermane: HUH?!?!
it's not official for at least a month in-story, so MirthTinker is fucking with me by saying shit like i'm her foals daddy
10ah
10XD
it's probably not true
after all, that'd be far too cruel
10;3
10anyway brb
ohai, you're cute, here's your daughter
and by the way... I STILL CALL DIBS ON SARAH SELENE
>.>
<.<
0I think something sexy just happened while I was cleaning up the kitchen, but I'm not sure what....
so... what are we doing in here today?
7Well
I'm watching AppleJack and Rainbow Dash having an epic ping pong battle
7it is time
attempting to stream house?
0ohai Sathi, did you see the topic?
Ping Pong? interesting...
7topic?
7who what where?
0Hoping for stream, worshipping at the altar of the sea ponies... The usual, Silvermane
ahh
0lol chat topic
let me know when something gets shipped to something
7House anyone?
YES!
/me 0ships Silvermane with Sea Ponies
0Silvermane, you know it's illegal to ship if you're not here
MORE HOUSE TROLLING!
5HAUZ
sure, i'd love some more pissy doctor does illegal stuff and saves lives
7gimme a few mins to set up
RobotPinkie, no. fuck the hippocampuses. they are abominations under Celestia's light and must be purged
EdwardNewgate... i know. here, hold on one second
man Rainbow Dash is TERRIBLE at ping pong
7did we finished ep 17?
pony video?
We were on the one where House gives the speech for vogler.
10YAY HAUZ TAIMU~
0Holy crap, Top Gear and ponies?
0They're sea ponies, Silvermane, get your facts straight!
0We finished that one
Yeah
shoo bee doo
0Actual sea horses don't look like ponies.
Sea ponies are Hippocampuses; just like air ponies are pegasi
and they are abominations
a hippocampus (or sea pony) is a mythological beast, much like unicorns and pegasi
and is an abomination
so it must be purged
WITH THE LEMONS
and a pinch of salt, to taste
10thanks for that man<3
0Wait, Silvermane were you going to do something while I waited for a second?
oh right.
0Still not the same, though I do like lemons...
0Hmmm, time for a fish dinner, methinks.
and it ends with a landslide. AJ with 10 and RD with 5
0WAT?
0Clearly AJ cheated...
Obviously.
/me hands EdwardNewgate a writ of authorization, reading "The Bearer of this Title is authorized by Princess Celestia, Ruler of Equestria and Bringer of the Dawn, to perform the act of 'Shipping' on the site known as 'The Brony State' for the day of August the Twenty-Third, 2011."
10Lies. AJ is worst pony.
actually it was more due to the fact RD kept falling asleep on clouds
0Well, that does make sense...
10RD gets +6 for cute
10RD WINS
0Also, ILU Silvermane
welp unfortunately I'm going to have to disqualify RD for obsessive fans :P
0^
10Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu~
now let's see if the mane six can defeat the best background characters in soccor
soccer8
**
inb4 ValtheJean is kicked.
(HOW U LIKE OBSESSION NOW!)
Rainbow Dash has worst personality, but i'd it that sooner than most of the mane 6
what was that Dashite? I couldn't hear you over how much I'm laughing at your being banned by Dari's script
10silvermane take that back (the first half, the 2nd half I can agree with)
I dunno ValtheJean, I'm pretty sure I hold the kick record now so you can STFU! :p
take what back? take your back? with pleasure!
0Pony with best personality is Snails
well...
10oh you silvermane
he's definitely a... ermm, UNIQUE pony
7streams up everypony
0I approve of this shipping
10*yesyesyesyesyes*
0Yay!
sathi, are you going to play DURRRRRGAANNNN for us?
0Haha
oooo, the top gear video that BBC noticed, ay?
0I want to hear Sathi read the voices
that'd be awesome
"Deeply disturbing, yet strangely compelling. Jeremy with long flowing locks and a come-hither expression.. Yes, deeply deeply disturbing."
10SILVERMANE WAT
10THE BBC MENTIONED PONIES?
alrighty, let's see how the mane hold up against BigMac, Caramel, Octavia, Ditzy Doo and Sorin
especially since then we dont get Elwyen crying in a high-pitched sultry british accent
RainBroDash, first article on EQD
10ASDOAHDFUHAIJFAFAIFD CHECKING BRB
0Valthejean Y U ADD SOARING BUT NOT SPITFIRE
Wut
0If I could kick you, I would
and the first goal goes to Octavia, don't think I expected that
BECAUSE SOARIN LIKES PIE
dAJGDKGAOPGKA$W()GJKEOPGKAEPROGJKAERgh
EdwardNewgate Y U NO SPELL SOAREN RIGHT?
and I had to make room for Caramel :P
10DARI ASDBAIFAHFHAUSDHASDFA

10I let you off, because you're not british. But still
Uh...
Stream froze for anyone else?
Or is it just video is pause?
0Stream didn't freeze, I don't think, it's just paused
Yup

0Sathi's trolling us

VEGAN IV
Persona, the series where you kill your enemies by shooting yourself in the head witha handgun

Why are there so many pony cakes?

0Ponies can eat meat
YAY, Canadian food that a pony could eat!!!!
RainBroDash, honestly, I'm... I'm so happy for seeing that
I'm crying with joy

EdwardNewgate, would they prefer to eat non-meat instea? I'm pretty sure they'd do
5link

That's the name
As unethical as House is, he is unethical for the right reasons.
House has the highest Renegade scores
He is unethical to save lives, not for personal interest such as the experiments the nazis did.
0Yeah.
yes, Valthejean. He does indeed.
0Chaotic Good House.
yeah.
7RBD likes Apple Fritter too
I don't think House qualifies as Chaotic Good.
10:D:D:D
oh god, if House ever said the Shepard journalist punching line I'd squee
10Apple Fritter is new best pony
What would he qualify for then?
House is Chaotic Good
And an INTJ

Fuck yeah

"This had damn well be worth it" or whatever he says
HEART ATTACK
CLOT
I think overlord was my favorite DLC
0Lawful Evil Baldy McBaldface.
Valthejean, I really liked the LotSB DLC.
CAR CHASE
Overlord has some okay scenes. Shadow Broker was the best on though.
yeah, Shadow Broker had the best rewards, but ung...it felt really really long
^^
Valthejean, it felt the best story dlc for me.
eh, I liked Overlord's atmoshphere
ung...god my typing
Arrival was good.
0>yfw I have no idea what was DLC and not in ME2
Not best but okay
you kidding? Arrival was terrible
0playing on PS3, neighas :P
lucky you RP.
Oh well.
it's such a lame excuse to put Shepard on trial for ME3
Arrival was such a stupid idea.
0Not really much difference, Dermathil
I liked Arrival
0just that you have everything on the disc
RobotPinkie: PC Master Race. :p
Eeyup RobotPinkie
"Hurr durr, there's this reaper artifact and we're aware of indoctrination. Let's keep it out in the open instead of spacing it"

7I cried this episode...
7:(
Valthejean, for the sake of spoilers I'm going to use PMs
fair enough
0and PC is cool if you can afford to upgrade it often enough

oh man this ep ;__________________________;
Reason being it's better to spend < 1k every two years than 2k + every four, because technology moves too quickly
0ergh, many manly tears were shed first time through this, yeah. :(
My 3 year old PC runs ME2 on full settings at 1920x1200. :)
my plan is save up as much money after college, then upgrade my comp to be skyrim/me3 compatible
7meh I got them tears burning in my eyes now :(
/me hugs Sathi
0mine wasn't :P
It cost me about $850 at the time.
7thanks Val
/me 5gives samthi an awezum hug
5feck
10I'm gonna starve myself for the first half-term of Uni, buy a new computer with my student loan
any time ;)
If companies continue the trend of all games being console ports
0but consoles, then it's $200 every 5 years, so...
$200
0much more price efficient
>$599
Errr
599 PS3 begs to differ
0lol you're assuming I bought my PS3 new :P
0well i mean NEW it was, just not... new new
:p
I didn't either myself, but still paid $300 for it
5my current is still running strong at 5 years
^
the MAN of the hour
0Got mine for about $300 with a game and an extra controller, I think
hopefully I'll only need to buy a new graphics card
link it to my GeForce 8800
hopefully...
GTS? GT? GTX?
0and even $599 every 5 years is more price efficient than PC gaming, really
GT
PC games are cheaper.
10except you're gonna buy a PC anyway
10you don't buy a ps3 and go 'welp, no point in getting a PC now'
10it's not comparable
My bro burned through three 8800 cards in a year
Ouch
Through no fault of his own but still
What was he doing?
0No, but a hardcore gaming PC is a lot more expensive
yeah, I'm betting overclocking
if you aren't careful with overclocking, those cards can die in a snap
The difference is generally the price of a mid-high end graphics card.
0I'm not knocking it, if you like PC then by all means go with that :P
7 4 more eps people
7enjoy
Nope, the power supply has a problem, it's probably overvolting the heck out of the PCIE power connector
my argument for a PS3 was basically "I like the games, plus I don't have a Blu-Ray player"
0thanks Sathi
I must go for a while, there is to be no shipping while I am gone. NONE
Unless there is a fault with the card, it's not likely that you are going to fry it unless you do something really stupid and try to double the speed right off the bat.
5@pony to be shipped with Edwardnewgate
6 to be shipped with Edwardnewgate is 8Mr a7nd 11Mrs C13ake
0close to how it was for me, ValtheJean
10yay another sports one :D
0I wub watching movies
No
I paid $420 on a GTS 8800 640MB
Stupidest decision I ever made
I picked up a PS3 for the exclusives.
>mfw I had badminton class today
even though I love my PS3, I really hate the idea of exclusives
the idea of a "console war" is rediculous to me
0Me too... I wish they competed on more technical merits
Well Val, that's a war like for every type of product
0best services, best performance
oh I know
OH SHIT SHE'LL LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND FALL IN THE POOL
it's just so rediculous to me
Honestly, there aren't enough exclusives to overpower one console
0Don't think I've seen this ep
SHE COULD DIE
0my money says she hits her head
Not this generation at least.
my problem with exclusives is I don't get to play games I'd want to
0because I've seen that happen, it's terrifying
0...oh, wrong guess :P
just because I'm not willing to buy two other consoles for like, 1 or two games
LOL
wow
5LOl
ROFL
That one I didn't see coming
0WAY wrong
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THAT
trololol
:p
/me 10didn't expect that AT ALL.

/me brohoofs Dashite
Same here
Hardly ever played either console
OH SHIT THAT'S ZE GURLK
0 360+PS3+Dreamcast+Gamecube+PC :P
0though my PC isn't the best for gaming...
I get all my multi-plats on PC, exclusives on the consoles.
0multi-plats on PS3, exclusives on whatever format it's exclusive to...
I can say I was extremely disappointed to finally play Twilight Princess on the Wii
0Yeah... I'm getting it on GC sometime...
I didn't like it
it was basically the selling point of the Wii when it started
0Really disappointed I didn't get to play left-handed Link on Wii. :P
Never played it.
LOL
and now you were exposed.

What?
What's this?

Yeah, awesome short film
PENIS SHIP!
It's hilarious

It's ROBOT BASTARD
@PenisJokesmeter That Ship
6 That Ship is 72% PenisJokes. (129)
please stop it with SBSQ. It reminds me of what made tv animation so shitty. STUPID JOKES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY BUT ARE JUST STUPID
NO U
U mad Dermathil?
can you recenter the view, or whatever you'd call it?

Spongebob
Spongebob Squarepants
Anyways, it matters which episode; Spongebob was a funny show a good quarter of the time.
Rob Schrab is my hero
obviously. If a show is only funny one time out of four, it is acceptable!
I think it's a pretty funny show
Not what I'm saying. I'm saying it had some pretty hilarious episodes, but some crap ones as well.
inb4 more penis jokes
herospirit So do MOST shows
hell back when I was 8 I found it just idiotic.
I'll switch my estimate to 33% awesome, 33% passable, and 33% just awful.
FUCK YOUR AIRLOCK!
Dermathil, then what shows did you watch as a kid?
I think I watched pokemons.
Robot Bastard is best robot... even better than me.
Spongebob was funny, but the later iterations just drag jokes out.
0Is this awesome, or just crap? I really can't tell.
lolol this is awesome
Dermathil, how can you say spongebob was terrible, and have watched that?
Well, Spongebob started funny, became AWFUL, then became HILARIOUS, and then dropped to passable.
I say this short is awesome given what they're managing to do with what is obviously a small budget
I can't wait to tell Mr. Krabs that you're a toilet.
@badassmeter Robot Bastard

120% robot bastard then?
Sounds about right
Wait
Wait
He's 20% more robot bastard than other robots
20% extra.
"Space is big, lets dump our crap there!"
lolol
Oh man, this shit is gonna give me nightmares, it always does

Nightmares? :0
Dude, quit bitching, you're obviously immune to bullets!
Oh man, this shit freaks me out. Always has

lolol this villain is awesome
BULLETPROOF CAMERAS!

Rainbow can have a rest. :0
My desktop pony of choice right now is Luna.
I just have my desktop cycle ponies
DON'T LEAVE YOUR MEATSHIELD VILLAIN!
Wait, your desktop background, or is there an option in Desktop Ponies to cycle your Pony?
Oh, no I mean my background
Do you know about Desktop Ponies? :0
Enlighten me
whuh?
DAT BITCH!
It's a program that makes ponies run around on your screen and interact with eachother. :0

That was me :P
so...
Durrrrrrrrrgaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrr?
Soooo......
and I love Robot Bastard... I kinda wish Schrab would do more stuff
Silvermane loves him some Durrrgan
Stream the Mentally Advanced series?
but it's not necessary, you can do what you wish
(by that, i mean PLAY UNTIL YOU GET 1000%)
Also, for some reason when you open DP, it has every Pony set to 1, so if you hit "GIMME PONIES" before "Set all to 0", it'll spawn sixty some ponies. :0
Which I accidentally did, of course.
woot mardek music! i love it so much
EXTERMINATE!
Oh, Dari, how many chapters is Mardek up to? I played the first two chapters a couple years ago.
Ohai everypony
Hey.
Hi Rdash
ohai RDash
herospirit, i'm the resident Mardek expert
Inform me Silvermane :D
Who's playing on the stream?
ohai RDash
'Lo there RDash
Mardek RPG has 3 completed chapters. With the release of chapter 3, chapters 1 and 2 were redone with the new equipment, skill, combat, and reaction system
Chapter 3 consists of more than double the playable characters of chapter 2, as well as a total of easilly 60 game hours
Is there anywhere where all the new versions and what not are available in the same place?
yes
Kongregate.com is very good for it
Alright, thanks :]
make sure you beat them in order, on the same site so taht you can transfer save files
oay, Mardek's official website - does he say anywhere where the development of chapter 4 is?
chapter 4 is not even started. he spent over 2 years straight on chapter 3 and he is burned out
ah, oay,
*okay
he's working on another game called 'Miasma' atm, which is about 65% done
i did that twice
I played the first couple chapters on Newgrounds years ago, and had thought the game just kinda died. Glad it didn't.
nah, he worked from 2008-2010 on chapter 3
Brb, spawning additional ponies.
>mfw there's a java port for Desktop Ponies
also, fighunter.com, his site, has a wikia site on it that has ALL info on the first 3 chapters, including maps, gear, skills, character bios, dialogue scripts, spoilers, etc
YESYESYESYESYESYESYES
A little secret that you might not notice in a typical playthrough: If you talk to Gallovar after saving Goznor from the zombies, he'll give you a yalortian amulet, which can teach your paladin friend green lightning. Figured I should mention it because none of the top comments do and neither does the walkthrough.
O_o
Hey, herospirit
I love this thing
Yar?
Yar! :]
I HAS ME SOME DERPY, DR. WHOOVES AND COLGATE ON ME DESKTOP MATE!
If you make your own animations and what not, you can make your own ponies with the built in pony editor.
I actually just found out about Desktop Ponies yesterday XD
Got it
If he finishes Mardek, I would totally pay money for it. :0
Whether he wants us to or not.
/me must investigate these newfangled desktop ponies.
>newfangled
>desktop ponies is OOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLDDDDDDDD
:P
nefangle to me lol
new*
Well, I think it got updated recently, or something, which is how I found it; EQD had a post about the update.
on april 15th
Sure.
0Is there going to be an encore for the euro bronies?
That explains why I didnt know about 'em. Didn't find EqD until after the 15th
Silver, which door do I take?
On april 15th? Not sure how I found it then, I wasn't a brony yet in april. :0
Take all the doors
All of them.
I'm not sure if we've discussed reruns, I thought it'd be a good idea though.
take your pick dari, one of them rejects you i think
not that one!
Turns out Java Ponies is shit.
...oh well
:[
What?! B-but I just found them :(
Just the Java version
I'm sure regular Desktop Ponies is awesome :P
0I agree with it. I was just talking about it with a mate of mine in the Philippines. I thought it would be cool if she could somehow see season two without staying up for the livestream.
Oh, ok, nevermind then :D >doesnt know the difference yet
I might not be able to stay up when Season 2 starts airing :(
First episode's a Saturday though.
First two*
So most people should be able to make that.
My desktop ponies keep confusing me. I keep wondering why the hell Twilight Sparkle is sitting behind the group in Mardek, reading books.
Oh, yeah
That's true
lolol
AH WAN DESKTOP PONEHS AND AH WANNEM NAAAAAAUUUU
So, Java version is that bad? D:
Oh well...
So wait
Well, at least if you run it in Linux it's that bad.
You going to stream season 2 live when it starts airing?
Hmm, window ponies or desktop ponies, which to choose?
Java is cross platform
I dunno, I haven't tried window ponies
I guess I'll try them both then!
They sit on your windows, then?
/me has no clue
Oh lol
My Colgate just walked up to the skeleton, brushed infront of it, then the character struck it down
Such wonderful pony based confusion
inb4 Kingdom Hearts reference
That's a pretty nice Colgate you have there
0HAX
Have fun Dari :p
0I love it when I can do that. ^_^
HE HAS THE KEYBLADE
WE'RE ALL DOOMED
HACKING SKELLY IS HACKING!
naturally
Silly skelly, this isn't Kingdom Hearts!
It's not a locksmith at all
just wait and see if he drops the keyblade. it's an awesome weapon
M. Shield, property of M. Bison
Sora obviously traveled to Mardek's world, only to be struck down.
...
OH COME ON!
He is now an undead minion.
M. Shield, property of M. Bison

This guy is a prick.
Dammit Sora, Y U NO DIE?!?!
Because Sora is more awesome than Mardek
he's a miniboss
ohmygawd big mac is walking around on my screen
Will remove taint fix Vehrn?
Sora fought over a thousand heartless at one time on his own. After stabbing himself with his own sword to save the chick. After smiling like a foal at Daffy and Goofy
Remove taint does not cure silence
Silence can be cured with that one item you have
i forget what it's called
cure the curse though
Curse is ugly
Liquidsound
And after all that, he was still struck down by this game's pricks
alright everybrony, I wish you all a great night.
MFW
Numb and silenced
Are you shitting me?
Night.
night Dermathil
ahh, rainbow dash is chasing my cursor
Curse: Disables all skills, Physical and Magical
SO MUCH PONY.
you bastards :P
And how goes the strategical battle with what was once a cross-dimensional hero?

well, not kicking it, but making you put up an effort
0Is this really a boss? Seems more like a Mid Boss, unless this game has small bosses.
Oh man, this just reminds me of the freaking giant ice robot boss in Skies of Arcadia
That bastard JUST. DOESN'T. DIE!
I love giant bosses...

Oh my goodness RDash, on a school computer?
There are 3 mini bosses, one full boss, and one end-game secret boss in this dungeon
Your bravery and shamelessness far surpasses mine

nothing worse than fighting 10 battles straight with a character that can only deal holy damage, then fighting a boss-level critter that is healed by holy
Most of our computers are locked at my school, but A.V. kids pretty much have free reign on their accounts in the A.V. room. I have an SNES emulator on mine. :3

Why is dari still playing this game
0Because RPG
because DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGAN
Hi Ziltoid!
hi rdash
Ziltoid, because he loves me
The blocking at my school is ridiculous. I remember my elementary school used the same blocker as the highschool... It blocked Neopets for Pornography.
Dari loves you?
Brutal.
yfw he's still got another dungeon after this, plus a secret boss and secret arena zone
NEOPETS NEED CLOTHING. It is scandalous.
This isnt all that fun to watch you know
Everyone here is bound by law to love SilverMane , or at least ship with him..... I think.
That's what he told me before molesting me, anyway...
I ship with no man, woman or pony
Ziltoid it is when you have ponies flying around it
I am invincible.

Aether beasties are weird

Spectre might not be undead
It has high def so I didn't bother trying to melee it. :/
They each have a behavior marked "theme" with a speech line associated, and the chance percent is "N/
you need magic to kill that thing
Enema is silenced
or to beat on it incessantly
"N/A", which I THINK means it depends on other ponies
Oh yah, and the speech lines are lines from the song, of course
OH OH OH

What does post punk even mean?
Lawl
He used beserk.
So he lost his turn
lolol
Which means he doesn't even get another attack before I kill him.
Can I not enjoy both, Ghosties? :P
lol, but he got haste too
4Post punk developed from the raw energy of punk but with the sensibilities of harmony
4It also tends to have a cavernous sound to its music

I wub The Cure too
4And then Faith No Man, when they were post punk
dat pentagram
I never really /got/ Punk.
I dunno what Faith No Man is, lol

13Someone paid $335 for a comic con poster at a Brony meet...
that big ass one?
13I dunno.
13Just says comic con poster.
so much name
13;)
13Shouldve saw the one I had earlier
see the FS plushie going for 220?
13I saw that too.
13But I figured they meant a regular comic con poster. Which you can get for 1/10 that on Ebay
damn rich bronys
13Indeed.
13They always outbid me on Ebay :(
13Soooooooo many pony customs in my bookmarks
I like the show, just not sure if I like it that much.
that's like a third of my rent.
13Yeah...
13A bit steep for me too
13But with so many people, you're bound to get some rich ones with lots of disposable money
on the other side of it, wish I was that good at crafting.
13I'm going to start making my own ponies soon via airbrush.
best i can do is comendear my frined 3d printer thing. and make ponies taht dont suck.
13Mic noise!
13Say!
13:)
13 3D printers are nice
13Just hella expensive
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASXnFRYf6LI
13You can make your own for kinda cheap
>kinda cheap
13But a good good one is like 15k or so
yes it is, good thing he owns it already I just have to pay for the plastic for it.
>£1000 at least
13I am Dr Mario!
I checked.
It's something like that. :P
13Yeah.
13Sounds about right.
13Cheaper than 15k :P
Yeah. XD
he makes custome cosplay stuff with it.
13I looked up good ones, one was 25k and I went "FUUUUUUUUUU~"
13Coolies
13Cant believe no one bid on that Canterlot throw at all.
13I would've snatched that up.

7me and my bf use
7:P
I get it
7need to download a cartoon
Sathi's insane internet.
7to test stuff
Server's upload speeds probably can't keep up for her to make full use of it.
inb4 27 bajillion seasons downloaded in 10 seconds flat
yea
something that doesn't get too in the way, but is still a theme?
7mwah virtual disk is only 40 gigs
I can do all sorts of stuff.
:P
We'll see.
Need to do the most imporant bit first though.
we'll see. we'll see (if you can be asked).
:P
>So much stuff to do
>That ranks quite low on my list
:P
7so little time
LOOOL i'm uninstalling stuff and 'regasm.exe' came up. registry A S M, but looks ... funny :P
7:o
Eeyup.
DUN DADI DADI
what you doing rite now then dari?
[13:11] I'm making a popout window for the stream.
7name a cartoon
so you're on that because u felt like it? does that rank quite high? haha
uuuhhhhhhh
/me literally goes dumb
... uuuhh
Ranks higher than making themes for pages that no longer exist.
uuhhh
>no longer
K.N.D.
Don't yet*
there
haha good point dari
um sathi uh i really can't think of one >_<
7Meh so much Naruto
you pick one :P
naruto is good
7zomg
7DBZ!
also 4:3 is looking like best ratio for your stream btw
7let's see what this is
inb4 1080p downloaded in under a minute
still only music btw
7I know :P
7reading review
OMAGASH dari! did ya buy the ponies?!?

for (you'll love this) Rainbow Dash ;D
...and rainbow cloud, the other one it comes with
or something like that
7i'm using a old usenet server switching as of sept 1
7this one is only giving me 4 connections :(
>only
oh it's 'rainbow flash' for other one. and Sathi the stream is fine atm aniways, but i guess a switch will only be a good thing
7going to this one
Better than downloading a file from a server that caps its speed at 50 kb/s.
:P
A file that's 20 GB big too.
can't really see the text, sathi, it's pixely
It takes 5 DAYS.
loooool
7lightning usenet
that looks good
7 500 days retention
7speed 50/100 Mbit\s
i think music got louder, sathi, is this normaly?
normal *
7yes I did that
7did not hear anything
ah well it worked then ; )
you're making my movie interesting too hahaha
with the music
So what's with the girl in the background? From something you watch?
7my bf likes anime..
yea i said earlier i didn't know who she was. who is she?
7but i'll change the background :P
I don't mind it :D
7link me a pony wallpaper :D

so will you change your bf's wallpaper to the mane6?
7yes
7just want to save it for him
YAY \o/
7so he can fix it
sound is a leeeeetle crackly with this song
: /
it's tiny
but little crackles in sound
it's probably the upload quality :(
ah well, it's fine really, it's so tiny
it's ther thou
7prolly cause of my download / uploads :P
haha
it's only in certain sounds too, so for example this osng only crackled a few times
but one earlier i mentioned crackled every beat xD
7I hear it too
ah oki
so i've been thinking: what's gonna fill the chat in LotR?
my precious / you have my X
probably THE RING too
Taking the hobbits to Isengard

HAHA nice

Thinking in Flash.
xD
On the site.
yeah, Daz.
is it a link to another window dari?
i see Dermathil
I'll be leaving in like 5 minutes
well ok then Dermathil
Nope.
hmm
The embedded stream and the pop out are completely unrelated.
could be a link above/below with other stuff i guess
Since veemi doesn't really have services like that built in.
it just ... doesn't really fit in anywhere in the page
WALLPAPER TIME!!! :2
:3 *
7woeiii
yay woollpeipah
WWU best song
No question
too bad it's crackly : /
and jumpy
7will fix it
7:P
it's slowed down a little cuz of 0.01 second delays constantly xD
song was a little slowed down haha
/me 7knows what's causing it
well that was louder i guess
7oh yes it was
7different music player :P
still crackly and tiny lags often making it sound a little slowed down
7good feedback
7thanks
Don't even mention it. I'm just saying what i'm hearing :3
POP
That's VAC probably.
7yep
Bits per sample at 32 and priority and realtime
Is pretty much all you can do.
It's fine in terms of a leeeeeetle crackly
but
7sound going down a moment
the tiny delays occurring a few times a second make it sound slowed down
and will make people fall behind in stream
7tell me
PERFECT
NO LAG/ DELAY
(OR CRACKLE)
WWU BEST SONG
7yay
but is it too high that some bronies can't strea mit?
D: i just heard 2 tiny lags
ah well definitely huge improvement. basically fixed.
were SO tiny
yah i'd say fixed basically
(just heard 3rd tiiiinny lag)
just sayin' :P
/me 7points at her download machine :P
4th. and ok i'll shuddup now
it's so tiny it's not a problem now
hmm sathi - (if you don't mind) what are your fave WWu remixes and can you play any of them?
