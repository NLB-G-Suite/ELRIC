Suddenly, A DerpyHooves` is here.
Are you drunk, DerpyHooves` ?
LawnchairRawket: no, she's typing with hooves!
that shit aint easy.
how goes?
/me 13checks DerpyHooves` blood muffin content

Typing with hooves? ibnoasboi bbio IBOCBJHVC NSAON odsnjo
05,15It's all saxy's fault she can't type with hooves
bluestrom_S: yes
Your right... it isn't
mmmmmmmm cold french fries from Burger King
seriously it's been down for 2 days now, are there any streamers on?
Typing with hooves? http://i.imgur.com/SrdsQ.jpg
tastes like cancer
or does this site only operate on a weekends basis?
bluestrom_S: people have been busy. Plus, Wrek streamed earlier.
OC alicorns; yay or neigh
NOPE.avi
/me 11,01has hands
05,15This is what happened last time someone tried to type with hooves http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/Twilightbook.jpg/250px-Twilightbook.jpg
weirdo
OC alicorns are stupid.
NxPaqu: depends on what they're used for.
fluttercry lol!!!
That's stupid! You're stupid!
0,5x3
0,5fluttercry made my day just now :P
what does it take to be a streamer RAWRity ?
I've created an OC unicorn to act as the main villain of my fic.
05,15<3
mod status is needed
I have a OC pony
So who wants a link to my other tubmlr? PM me if you do
bluestrom_S: be a mod, have the ability and motivation to stream something people want to see.
his name is Rock Candy
11,01I need an OC draconequus.
11,01Or a pic.
it's both a more personal tumblr + ... a bit nsfw >>;;;
Are you a bad enough dude to stream on Bronystate?
13i bit
mods of bronystate I want to stream content, I accept the challenge and my body is ready!
11,01I don't have the stream controls yet. Too new.
スタイルでレインボーダッシュは常にドレス！
Wait...
11,01Hence why I'm only /half/ an op.
Wong past
e
more moonspeak
http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxzerf6YFb1r361q4o1_400.jpg
There we go
I don't speak them moonrunes.
daww
05,15awww woona
also
Woonarunes.
NSFW stands for Not Safe From Wrek here
lol
which is the rule that if you have a OC pony and it's male
13except when it stands for non-PG-13
again, if you want link to my other tumblr then PM me
lol, my OC is male
Wrek will eventuyally draw a saucy female version of it
i.e. r63
Confound these ponies and their cuteness.
what do you mean? Wrek's a nice guy, he gives out candybars
i wouldnt mind if he did otakon
11,01Cold Front is doomed.
13except for when you are already female
Good :) how about you?
Drawing ponies....so jealous (still)
13in which case he makes you beautiful
Dken2021: yeah, then he, in his OWN words "butttaze"
damn I don't have that quote anymore
Wrek "I'm like a bird of prey, I search it my quarry and STRIKE! Then I dump the body into the bay"
05,15Well I have class in the morning so I'm off to bed. Goodnight everyone.
night fluttercry sleep well
night fluttercry
/me hugs fluttercry
nighty night

http://i41.tinypic.com/4sl3wk.png Doo doo de doooooo.

Get out of here, Stalker.
13okay if my keyboard is going to keep derping on <3, i am just going to declare that ~<# is now a rose :3
I like it

Shizuka: wouldn't that be ~<@
13shh
lol
Stalkers dont listen to lawnchairs *keeps crawling through the grass*
13nein otakon, deus ex tuxedo was just kissing up
lol
8,1right, i need some help, fillies and gentlecolts
0,5YES?
so your saying Tuxedo Mask was just a deus ex machina?
oh?
/me to the rescue!
8,1i need to get from here (scotland) to there (new york) for bronycon
Okay what?
13cannon
8,1in a manner that is not horrendously expensive
I'm saying Sailor Moon was nothing but deus ex machina
0,5I can pick you up in my private choppah
8,1i also need to find somewhere to stay that is not horrendously expensive
0,5You can stay here
0,5Im in MA
Motek
13sailor moon was pretty much built out of machinas
*Motel
0,5:3
8,1sweet!
/me 8,1hugs LordCelestia
Deus Ex Machina in Short Skirts
11,01I live in PA.
8,1i will bring you some scottish beer! \o/
0,5otakon He wasnt leaving he was saying help silly
[$(5)$]
o.o I want scottish beer.... i love beer
11,01Bronystate at BroNYcon July 2012?
I'M RICH!
8,1MirrorImage: the cheapest transatlantic flights i've seen are upwards of £300
8,1each way
My flash crashed
0,5No but really I cant have someone in my house, I am but a 16 year old >_<
13why your PHP no work
highjack a plain: free flights anywhere.
*plane
damn it
though i have heard reports that the best time to book flights is 6 weeks before the flight itself
11,01I have a place in PA, but I'm not certain that I'll still be here come BroNYcon time.
why did my flash crash again?
back...
so there'll probably be better offers appearing in April or May
8,1but i might be looking in the wrong places
MirrorImage: that's correct.
8,1LordCelestia: just say i'm a... immigrant slave?
8,1i dunno
I always book a good 2-3 months before flights
maybe thats a tad early
0,5x3
8,1anyhoos, yeah, my budget is as little as i can spend, what's accomodation pricing like in new york for hostels?
11,01If I happen to still be in State College, I have an apt and State College has an airport.
...
Nittany_Discord: yeah, but State College is... what, a 8-hour drive to Boston?
D:
iS BACK
heck, i live in Pittsburgh and i know that'd be a decent drive alone
11,01Yeah. I'm about to calculate times.
8,1okay, looks like accomodation shouldn't be a problem
i would love to go to any brony related cons... but i has no moneh
someone fill me in... what are we talking about exactly?
8,1now all i need to do is build a gigantic catapulty
no idea
oh look it's that other alicorn
I want to avoid all the spaghetti flowing at a Bronycon.
That would just be silly.
11,01New York is only 4 hours 13 mins from State College.
11,01I-99 to I-80 straight there.
Oh BroNycon travel. XD I live like 30 mins away from the city
yep
so lucky
11,01I might or might not go to BroNYcon. I'm not a con person, and I'm going to be moving around the end of June.
i will now develope teleportation so all bronies can reach BroNycon
11,01Because I'm graduating this Spring.
:O Oh wow!
or create a interdimensional portal
cool ^_^
so we can get the Pegasus to give us a lift
Open the portal jump in.
I'm 6 hours from the Big apple.
debating on going
I wants to go to bronycon...so that I can cosplay and stuff :D
Dashie_Dashie: you can do it!
11,01Cosplay as gala ponies!
Take pictures, LadyCanary
yeah
11,01I take Rainbow Dash.
I'd like to go too
Nittany_Discord: OH GOD. I WISH
but I has no monies atm
I want to go to Bronycon so I can meet you guys!
If only I had the skills ;^;
11,01Though you better grab eye bleach.
9,1Wish I had the time and resources for a decent cosplay...
Im definently going to BroNYcon. I hope to see as much of Bronystate there as possible :)
same dcd
Hello NewDCD ^_^
I am going to stay far far away from any Bronycon.
i just wish I could sew.
ohey newDCD
new plan... win lottery and buy personal jet to fly around the world meeting ALL the bronies
i'm definitely not going to bronycon, i dont have the money
Faaaaaaaaar away.
11,01If we could get a bronystate panel, that would be interesting.
Amaaazing!
:3
IKR
Midnight_Tempest....i dont even think the lottery would have enough funds for you to meet all the bronies
Confound these ponies, I'll be back in an hours or two.
That would be epic
LawnchairRawket: why?
or at the very least a group meet-up
Because I'm antisocial and I hate cons and oh my god that would just be embarrasing.
Sorry I got nothing to say...yet that is haha
Awww.
so why are you here?
11,01Me: Mom, look, I'm internet famous. Mom: What for? Me: A pony convention!
Ingwaz: Then I will make them have enough funds... its for the good of the land!
I always hide my power level whenever I go outside.
Going to a con like that would be like going SS3
then dont
I'm very shy. Heck, when I was Black Canary, I was still my shy self ._.
That's just ridiclious.
LawnchairRawket: but you would be among fellow antisocial embarassed nerds! You could revel with your compatriots!
11,01Well, like I said, I'm truly not a convention person.
BRONYCON
I'd rather not.
11,01I figure conventions are for the high-end fans.
maybe it's time to go to the neighbouring country to the sotuh
I never went to any kind of con, but wish to go to one
LadyCanary: wait wait wait...you cosplayed as Black Canary?
south*
Only so much spaghetti can fit in one room.
i wouldnt mind conventions, but i dont have th money for the hotel, travel fees, and all the money i would want to spend on the merch
for the first time in my life xD
That, and I can't get to NY easily.
11,01And I'm introverted.
And I have no money.
LawnchairRawket: I would go if I were you. You get to meet people that share the same interest as you, and so many of them are great people in general.
so i'll probably just do as i did during the last convention, stay home all day and watch the livestream
That I did RAWRity. Mind you, I dont think I did a fantastic job on it, but I was proud
11,01But BroNYCon looked fun. Also, I knew someone who went.
i watched the livestream from like 10 am cst to 19:00 cst
LadyCanary: that's AWESOME!
yea go to it LawnchairRawket, if you can
I'm staying right here.
:(
Faaaaaaaar away from all that nonsense.
Fox made Brony con look stupid :(
11,01He brought back a couple of good print including an awesome Rarity pic.
They focused on the weird people
that nonsense keeps the communtiy alive LawnchairRawket
Pony_of_War: fox made itself look stupid.
True...
that's Fox for you
11,01Red Eye? Just a comedy show from what I hear.
Why Fox news would even BOTHER to cover that is beyond me.
especially with what he said to Nicole Oliver.
Its not the right kind of community, if you ask me. But whatever.
Any other news station BUT FOX.
11,01LadyCanary: For Lulz.
There are SOOOOO many awesome bronies out there
news reaactions?]
LadyCanary: slow news day, plus a chance to try and make fun of the "Weirdos"
Why did they have to focus on the weird ones?
meh, alot of these reports are Biased
LawnchairRawket: Why are you even here if you dont like the community?
Wrek's pony art, for instance
or all that AMAZING MUSIC
Because I'm a masochist and some of the stuff streamed here is neat.
The guy made himself look like an ass. He wasn't just messing with some of the weird fans, he was belittling professional Voice Actresses and altogether being a dickbag.
Beyond that, no real rasin.
rasins are not real. canon
/me 11,01hugs LawnchairRawket
Bluh.
Like this - This art
O.O
fox news isnt professional, they are paid to say what their owners want them to say
it's so good
Pretty much
some, not all
Rebellion in Lybia? Buck that
but mostly the ones that have slow news
Kim Kardashian isn't married!
CNN does whatever the fuq they want. Not in a good way
Nittany_Discord: sort of.
Who wants to hear about government overthrow?
lol
its ok
I rather like CNN, they were tolerable
oh me!
Fox is bent towards the Right, MSNBC is bent towards the left, and CNN lets Twitter do the reporting for them these days.
^
Obviously Kim Kardashian is more important than an ENTIRE BUCKING COUNTRY!
CNN is the only news group that tries to tell you about the outside world... but not well enough
<endrant<
11,01I don't even know who Kim Kardashian is.
Eh, I just ignore that stuff, Pony_of_War.
>
I don't watch the news
There'd have to be news
It's not worth complaining over.
also, we have a channel called "Headline News" that reports almost exclusively on celebrity relationships.
i ignore everything... ignorance is bliss
soooo while we are talking about modern day stuff, who is going to win the super bowl?
Giants
no one cause super bowl is dumb
11,01News to me became war and women's health, so I stopped watching.
I say Dorritos
IMO I don't care but meh awesome friend doesn't like the pats (und she's a girl :))
the Sponsors win the super bowl every year
/me 11,01doesn't care about the Super Bowl unless his team in it.
11,01*is
What's your team
11,01Panthers.
Ah.
Nittany_Discord: ouch.
Falcons didn't make it so.....Go Patriots!!!
11,01Yeah.
thats tough
Nittany_Discord: how'd that record turn out again?
go Blue Jays!... wait... thats baseball
11,01They were in the Superbowl once, but were defeated by the Patriots.
Im sorta on the Tebow wagon myself
^
Tebow is good
11,01It wasn't bad this year.
Nittany_Discord: I remember that. Twas a sad day.
11,01Yeah.
I liked Tebow even when he was in Florida
11,01New team makes the superbowl.
I started being interested in Football this year, before I didn't care
I can't wait for Tebow to suck next year and thene everybody to complain about him.
figures it was the last playoff game in the 4th quarter
11,01What's the story of that game: Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction.
11,01?
(well, next to last)
I sooooo wanted the 49-ers in the superbowl. The Giants did not deserve to win that game
too much football... boo football
That kick returner screwed EVERYTHING up
But NY and Boston are rivals
Not as much in football
the ravens well and trully lost theirs. How do you fuck up a 26 YARD FIELD GOAL?
Should be good
Dat Cundiff
Kick it far to the left RAWRity, kick it to the left
HEs the best kicker in the NFl...
and yet...
i would be interested in football if it had more ponies
Midnight_Tempest: imagine the broncos are ponies.
that would be ... interesting
ive always hated the broncos
Just imagine the linemen as pinkie and the QB as someone who broke a pinkie promise
Tebow is Princess Celestia... THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING
Hrm.
Tired.
I am going to go to sleep.
Goodnight.
Pony_of_War: that thought is going to give me amazing dreams tonight, thank you :)
Soo...Skylanders is on sale this week :) gald I waited
nighty night LawnchairRawket
You're welcome
RAWRity Tom Brady is discord more or less
seriously, taht last game was just...YEESH.
/me hasn't dreamed about ponies :(
/me has dreamed about hot friend though :)
Which one? Ravens?
Pony_of_War: it'll happen. took many months before I had a pony dream.
/me dreamt about herself being a magical girl
yeah XD
At least they made it to the playoffs
/me dreams very violent dreams

11,01I think 8 AM classes should be banned.

...I heard a ping...
10,02Nittany_Discord: That
11,019 at the earliest. No earlier.
not Pocky, "Packy"
10,02What's even worse? Having a 7:30 AM class

11,01Wat?

Ever seen Airpl;ane?
11,01I have.
"Are you kidding? I hate the furry little bastard, if I could I'd throw him in a sack. Throw the sack intoa river and hurl the river into a Black Hole! But I love filling out requisitions and this was a doozy..."
11,01Good movie.
Airplane, GREAT MOVIE
Darf14: i'm sure its excelent, just not my kind of comedy
11,01It's actually Airplane!
Airplane!!!!!!!
oh yah
ok I understand
The Naked Gun is much like that-- but a cop show type.
Love that movie
08,14.-.
with OJ Simpson
absolutley loved airplane
eeyup
before he went psycho
Easy top 5 in my book
Well, I still hold Monty Python and the Holy Grail as the BEST COMEDY EVER!
I concur
^
ohey pinkiepieswear
havent seen airplane, from that quote it looks funny
Is it just me, or is the sound rather muted?
It's just a flesh wound.
its rater muted
Kencolt: SB is on a call
Monty Python's Flying Circus > Holy Grail IMO
I feel happy!
Oh. Well...
SB threw it into Autopilot.

Kencolt, looking for some stupid magical cup, and fuschia. I have a document here, notarised, signed in triplicate, and a personal letter of approval from the Queen Mother, anotyher from Princess Celestia, and a third from Irving Thalberg. Out of the way scruffy little man.

oh god yes
And all I see is white screen...

Discord is such a tranny, youtube can't show it.

i see no vidoe
ticipation
it's derped is all
at least theres sound
dat SOPA
when that happens you copy the link and open a new tab
That wasn't SOPA.
its a chrome bug
le Cafe. You know you want to
he's off doing something else atm
ah

but he got a call at?
25 min ago?
oh
not that late
15 min
it's only about 10 where he is
I checked
I meant the TIME
oh
not how long ago
but cosidering how long he's been talking
We're all over the US, Eurpoe, and for all I know Asia. Late can be anything.
9:20 ish
hope it's not bad news
It's a call regarding our fieldtrip to Equestria.
i hope not
A fieldtrip to Equestria... how nice. I haven't seen the pack in a long while.
Confound these ponies, why must they be fiction ;^;
i hace about $9.50 aud of 'internet money' that will be useless in a week, what should i buy?
And so often stream-derping?
I suggest
hmm.... how about a pony
I don't know
no idea what that means.
how about a downloadble good old game
dat Nyan!
Nyannyannyan
/me headbangs to it
NyanDash
hmmmm
Nyan Nyan Nyan Nyan
Well, at least it's not a poptart-feline hybrid.
And the stream freezes on me yet again...
refresh
Rainbow Dash being the Nyan is more believeable
AGAIN
all RD needs is a poptart body
It's a derptastic night!
Better a poptart than a cu-- no, not going there.
6_9
i must start working again, ding me if you need me
sweet
allso this is awesome
wow, now that is creative
Yay.
/me yay~
Everypony wants a fluttershy.
Yaaay~
I hope.. if I ever go into a Coma.. I dream of ponies.
hmm.... I feel like playing that game again
I have it
on my 3DS
I have it on the GBA
eeyup
it's the GBA version
I'm gonna reboot my PC... this keeps freezing on me.
Kencolt: wait, just try clearing your cache first!
yay, this song
too late
*points to low quality Stream popout*
:3 this gives me chills. Makes me wanna float on a cloud.
why you point Dashie_Dashie?
was talking to colt lol.
it's just NewDCD's video stream of his basement...
yeah
the mane stream isn't always the same stream on the popouts
This video..
needs more Yay~
and
the hq popout
the chanel no longer exists.....
I don't like the sound of that.
And I have no video whatsoever now.
and now i have to run a cable, later #Bronystate
Kencolt: what browser?
otakon: the popouts are neglected, have been for a while
Firefox.
see ya Phase4|OnTheRoof
bye Phase4
later
toodleloo Phase
Kencolt: have you checked all the updates for it recently? Flash, add-ons, FF itself?
As far as I know... yes.
well check um again
But.. can't hurt to check.
oh crud! Wild Pinkie!!! WHAT DO I DO?!?!
then, clear your cache
SB's back.
video was paused. @_@
I think SuperBrony64 's computer just went to sleep
hmmm
this must be serious
Hey computer, wake up!
Dat pinkiepoke.
Says I'm up to date.
slowpie
Kencolt: clear you cache
lol, didnt noticed the slowpie
And... I forget how to do that. :P/ I'm on XP...
argh
Tools>Clear History>Clear Everything>Just click Cache and run it
Sue me, I'm old, and the guy who built this never really told me anything.
lol
how old?
Not to old for Molestia.
lord
okay, do that Kencolt?
I just did... wait...
yeah
the stream is paused
See you later bronies, I have to go and do.... MATH! :O
see ya Darf14
MATH!?
okay, one last step
Bye Darf14!
That did something. I think.
Seeya Darf14!
Kencolt: close and open FF back up
OK.
hello KetaminaDianePie
ah
hello!
alright im off to bed goodnight bronystate! ^_^
my ears
Bye Darf14.... oh wait thats me well bye :)
KetaminaDianePie: how long you been lurking?
about one hour
ah
hows the island?
So... am I supposed to be looking at a screenfull of Pinkie doing nothing?
still empty luckly
eeyup
sorry Kencolt you got it fixed
in time for the stream to stall
inb4 rage
it's like breaking the speed limit
what happend to SupeerBrony64?
fk
SuperBrony64
he went to go answer a call
and just getting to the red light first
he's AFK
I think Chrome must have froze again
nope
10,02Sorry, phone ;____;
Dashie_Dashie: then wat?
that's oka
the video still loaded after it was paused =o
thought it might have been something serious
10,02Bit of a serious conversation right now...
ah
damn it
We figured SB.
Iguess it's working better... as far as incoming is going...
anything that we could do to help?
there goes ketamina
and he's back
back again.............
Doubt I could be of any help. I suspect he doesn't have anyone he needs bitten.
I return with applejuice
wb
hmmm
he must still be on the phone
I suspect he is.
Then let us be patient.
Okay. Question time. What is the single worst food you have ever eaten?
cow's brain
Meanwhile.. Pony OC
http://tinypic.com/r/fcuv7k/5
ummm
has to be pickled herring
yuck
Cow tongue.
it was sour and it CRUNCHED
yet it was slimy too
very nasty
Sounds delicious.
:P
in my case, it was when I was in the Boy Scouts, and some self proclaimed idiot made for the troop shewy spahgetti. I donot mean al dente. I mean CHEWY.
A properly prepared cow tongue is delish.
yuck
thought, I don't mind smoked neck
or porigies!
I LOVE porigies!
100x this ^
Youmay have to get used to the texture-- but the flavor...
it's TONGUE though
as in, like the one in my mouth
I like tripe-- if properly done. That said, it takes a while to do it properly.
tha hell are porigies?
hmmm
a Porigie
is a polish dumpling
made with mashed potatoes and cheese as the filling
otakon: If you kiss a girl (or boy) tongues are tasting tongues a lot anyhow? So what's the problem?
whoaaa
usually fry them up in light oil
sounds delicious
with some bacon and chopped onion
and server with sour cream
dat Fluttershy stare
now im getting hungry......
8,1what are your opinions on eating pets once they die?
hi
umm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXgFZgnivXs&feature=g-u-u&context=G204b2a8FUAAAAAAAHAA
8,1i'm trying to settle an argument.
are they fresh?
8,1yup
8,1perfectly edible
were they healthy?
If they died, it's not probably safe meat.
yeah
8,1we're assuming yes
too risky
if it died of natural causes
well if it edible ill give it a try
What did they die of? Is it possibly contagous? What are the local laws in your area? WHYTHE HELL ARE YOU EATING GERBIL? (not Guinea Pig-- that's different, Equador, they raise them there for eating. It's called Cuii.)
umm
you eat Guinea Pigs?
WHY!?
they are so cute and fuzzy
Used to be delicacy for only the royalty. Nowadays, everyone can and does eat it.
anyone has ever tried horse meat?
O.O
I haven't
....Not I.
Yes, Otakon. they are cute, and fuzzy and YUMMY.
but I hear you have to stew it
nope
because horseflesh is damn tough
SuperBrony64: you okay man?
N-not the guinea pigs
you just use it like cows meat
D:
I have. In Mexico. Well flavore, but very very lean. Almost always used ground.
what?
Horse or Guinea Pig?
That, or as has been noted, long stewed.
Well
Horse. I have yet to get to Equadorand try cuii.
I've had gator before, just like beef really
Also Burro. You eat what you can buy.
in a chili dog, delicious
Gator tastes NOTHING like beef. Closer to catfish IMHO.
btw i dont like horse tht much..... but horse salame is good
SuperBrony64: please say something man, getting worried
10,02Hey, I'm back
phew
10,02Sorry for worrying you all
Everything alright, SuperBrony64?
Is OK.
indeed, you okay?
10,02Yeah I'm fine >_<
10,02Thanks for asking
good to hear
hey there guys :3
hiya ScootalooWonderloo
I mean, IS OK he worried-- that's what Bronies are for. But indeed is YOU OK?
SB!
Kencolt: he said he's okay, if he wasn't he would say he wasn't
10,02I basically need to fight my school that a D- is enough of a grade to make a class count as a prerequisite.
damn
THIS IS AMAZING
Apparently not since he decided to assault us with this!
10,02Hai KetaminaDianePie
...Oh dear...
that sucks man
10,02They've been screwing me over since I first started
well
it is technically a passing grade correct?
just below average IIRC
10,02Imagine half-way through the semester of a super hard course telling me that it's no longer a requirement.
10,02D- in their course catalog states 'Barely Passing'
SB64: You're prolly going to lose. I had to take Calculus three times to get the needed C before it was accepted.
:OOOO <3 this song...kirbopher is a genus
damn it that's not fair
10,02They've done so much to me that I should be arguing way more about what they did
argh
10,02Changing requirements on me left and right
whatever happened to student rights?
your paying THEM
not the other way around
raritys flank....should be feard by all ~.~
10,02Plus now our student government is passing a bill ON THEIR OWN BEHALF to be compensated financially for their work.
10,02Real jerk move.
damn it
Dang. ;^;
:O
You're payingthem to be educated. And to make certain you are educated. I mean, I can see how it can be frustrating, but they do have a point.... and standards.
US colleges piss me off
what's the course SB?
OK. The SGU is going beyond their perview.
10,02Indeed they do, but I've worked hard getting great grades these semesters and because I got that grade in one class they are throwing their hands up in the air saying 'Too bad'
wait
10,02Introduction to Materials
they're busting your chops
and i come back... to zelda ponies... AHHHHH!!!
on one course?
hey Midnight_Tempest!
out of how many?
SB, the silution is -- sadly-- simple. You retake the class and pass with the rightgrade. At the least you have a hoof up.
AYAAYAYAYAYAAAY
never did this
lolz
10,02Out of like at least 30-35 courses
<3 THIS VIDEO :3
hey my ringtone!
yeah
bullshit
/me explodes, reforms, explodes again, reforms again then implodes
one damn course
10,02It's the flaw of being a part of a new university that is offering a major in a relatively new industry.
Been there, suffered though it-- it's not unusual.
still bullshit
dat plot >.>
o//o
what the blazes....
otakon, I can't agree. It's more that standards aren't always what you agree with.
she uses that think like a weapon..i swear :/
Okay. This just got WRONG.
its super effective
/me now has a nose bleed
> implications
Sb, Play Fluttershys Lantment :3
/me actually does have a nose bleed, just started randomly
Kencolt: so basically your saying it's fair that the make him retake it as a requirement despite doing well enough in the other courses? 1 out of 30 according to SB?
>.<
The scary thing, is somewhere, somepony THOUGHT about this!
ONO
10,02"...Until it gets cut off and used as a half-mustache."
oh lords
/me facepalms
Not this soooong ._.
worst song EVAH
damn you mesmerizing plot movement!
otakon: Yes. If it's an essential course, yes. I had to do the same on my second degree.
fus ro yay :3
10,02I'm going to try something, but give me a few min. Stream will be down until then
still sounds like pretentious college bull to me tbh
hi
Whatever you have to do SB64 ^_^
but I'll take your word on it Kencolt
gives me time to check timblr
GOGOGO SB!
oh well
tumblr*
I need a drink anyway
Well, as I said,-- I have TWO baccalaureates. Experience. Some courses are more... critical than others. And they do make the rules...
Yeah
after they take your money
i iz a smrat ponie lulz...
I wonder how much MORE it's gonna cost him to retake that course?
BOOMheadshot
oh, a couple of grand mayhaps?
probably
oh well, that's just another year or two in debt after college
its gonna take probably that much just for me to do my IT courses in september
the important thing is PASSING the course.
what the hell is the point of the collegiate system in the US nowadays? It's not like it can guarantee you a job now and it can leave you in years worth of debt.
Actually glad I didn't go to college when it was suggested I should tbh.
There are no guarantees ever of anything. I studied to be a journalist... and sadly, graduated just after the newspapaer market was saturated by a pack of loons.
yeah
well that's why most people go to college
not for the sake of learning
for the improvement of their chances in the job market
Then I took a second degree in computer sciene-- and just after I graduated all the tech exploded, so all mu studies of CoBOL and Machine Language was rendered useless by the PC revolution.
Have you ever heard of the old bit "If you don't go to college, you'll end up flipping burgers the rest of your life". Well, the burger flippers became owners and managers while the college goers are in debt and looking for gainful employment.
I live on a trust fund-- and oddly happily. But I do miss the possible opportunity that I might have had had I graduated at the right time...
cobol and machine language?
hmmm, well that sucks in your timing it seems.
I take it you're not familiar with those terms?
Eh, I'm just being cynical about my own situation I should stop.
im just wondering HOW OLD ARE YOU?
my dad studied the same thingsa
COBOL: Common Business Oriented Language. Oh- 54 last November.
That's what I've been wondering too. But he didn't say.
wat?!
Yes. Mucho older brony.
woah
:D!
and here I thought I was one of the older members here.
my dad is 55
54? wow... thats like 2 of me
good lord, your twice my age Kencolt
...54?
I've never made a secret of it. I have an artificial hip-- broke it a few months back. Eyes suck, and my teeth aren't much better.
o___o
Well sir, I apoligize for my rude comments earlier.
8,1who's the oldest here?
8,1i'm 24, i know otakon's 27
im 27 too
8,1how old?
So you whippersnapper-- be wary! You have a bucking ELDER here!
Like I said-- I speak from experience.
54
8,1what?
lol whippersnappers
8,1seriously?
he's 54
8,1that's awesome!
indeed
How often do I have to say it?
alright, I shall pay heed form now on.
i love it when there are bronies that old, they have the best sense of humour on the planet
damn, I have been surprised by this place yet AGAIN
8,1Kencolt: sorry, i'm not good at context at this time of morning
I thought Wrek was older
morning?
8,1but yeah, that's awesome
he's 17
8,1a real COBOL guy too
I thought ScootaChicken was older
November 13, 1957. I grew up during Vietnam and the Hippies. (who were mostly idiots.) I remember riots when Martin Luther King got shot, and watche the Moon Landing on w 12 inch B&W TV.
he's 14
Daaaaang.
:D idiot hippies
damn man, you live through it!
actually
And yes-- I votyed for reagan. Both times. The man may not have been everyone's cup of tea, but he did do womthing that no other president did...
Scorpio's rule! November 7th for me
10,02Awww...I'm missing a certain cable to make it perfect...
your as old as my dad
10,02BUT
10,02I will try and do what I'm about to do
When he said he was goling to do something-- he DID it.
you failed me for the last time SuperBrony64!!
10,02:<
10,02It won't be perfect...
ooooooowww
now say what i said in Megatrons voice :D
well, give it a shot
GOGOGO!
10,02Until I get the cable tomorrow
10,02Won't be able to talk while I do this though
you better SB... Im watching you >____O
So, otalon- I have some... small reason... to suggest that I have some idea of which I speak. :)
10,02Here we go...
orlly?
Go on ahead SB~
what?
oh
OH!
do eeeet SB
I read that wrong the first time. Yeah, I elieve you now
believe
Actually, I lucked out during the MLK debacle-- I was in a small ht in Soutyh Carolina when it happened, we were on vacation, far from an urban center.
Dear Princess Celestia, I learned to listen to my elders today. They got to be elders for a reason. Your faithful student, otakon
I would say
MLK... that sounds familiar...
I believe the term is LOL.
/me giggles.
MArtin Luther King.
Martin Luther King Jr. Midnight_Tempest
yesh
ok, thought so
8,1Kencolt: what do you think of functional programming?
I was in my early teens and the only thing I could think was "Oh, crap."
yeah, that covers it.
i would've thought the same thing
My studies are sadly out of date. But assuming the term means what it implies, it sounds like a sensible thing.
10,02going live!
8,1scheme, ml, haskell sort of thing
Yaaaay
I'm a WASP 54 year old male. What ELSE wouldI have thought at that-- or any- time?
AHHHHH!!!
/me 8,1is becoming more of a functional junkie every day
dat 3DS
3ds.................
Mario Kart! :D
Again-- my studies ended with COBOL and Basic and some C+. Those I don't know about.
suddenly loud noises
mario kart 7... i am disappoint...
we can hear you breathe SB :)
damn it's loud
Aw come on, Mario Kart 7 was great, Midnight_Tempest.
that is some good sound capturing though, damn
well, now I REALLY feel like a dullard around here.
Ok, reload screen-- and it's stopping-- now starting, now... what?
hmmm
Kencolt: you might want to check your connection speed
i havent played a mario game since the 64 LadyCanary... i havent had fun with mario kart since the SNES though
Ah.
The usual 100 MBPS.
dat buffering...
8,1Kencolt: i was surprised to read the other day that COBOL is still in use in the big enterprises
http://www.speedtest.net/
well, run this anyway
if it's that fast
you shouldn't be experiencing starts and stops
Oh-- it's got two advantages, really. One is that COBOL is PERFECT for accounting... it was designed for that. the other is it's self-documenting-- even a Vice President can learn to understand the basic idea of a program.
lol
damn
You don't have much faith in the intelligence of the average Vice do you?
well... i dl at about 6 MBPS... that sucks
eyah
your lucky
lolwut?
I only get 2 Mbps tops
wow
8,1bugger, hs'e gone
8,1i really want to meet him irl now
8,1he sounds aweosme
3.35 Mbps :(
hell, me too
/me nods
yay! i have highest speed so far
he must have been dc'd
8,1i might add COBOL to my learn list after Scala
8,1looking into it, it's actually quite a nice language
wow though, I can't believe that there are fans out there that old
I know! What a shocker.
I think that really does say something about the show
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1728986505.png
there, my results
at least my ping is low
10,02????
what's up SB?
the show is the perfect way of bringing the world together... i will now make a blimp that will transmit the show to every TV in the world
don't forget every language
you know... my upload speed is horrendous
10,02How was the stream?
choppy
audio out of synch...
10,02Really? :<
yeah, not just me for once
my stream keeps on buffering
Yep.
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1728986218.png
it was choppy Sb and the audio was WAY out of sync I'm afraid
10,02Lemme drop quality and see what happens
needs more fiddling
/me is now off the roof
10,02Alright, going to try again
hello again
hi agian Phase4
GOGOGO!
10,02Please keep me updated if something happens >_<
Phase4: guess how old KenColt is?
12?
54
wow
yeah
scroll up the chat a bit
it was either realy young or old, picked the wrong one
lol
10,02I see you figured out who was about double your age
yeah, you had a fifty fifty chance I guess along that line of though
SuperBrony64: he IS double my age
Well. Im off to bed now. I've had a long bittersweet day. Goodnight all! Have a great day/night all <3
your 27?
10,02Yup, like I said before :P
night LadyCanary

10,02Except didn't want to give a name...
eeyup Phase4, why?
10,02Anyway Night LadyCanary!
just wondering
/me hugs LadyCanary
SuperBrony64: I can understand that.
10,02Let's try this again
/me is 18
/me hugs everyone on #bronystate. Enjoy the stream!
10,02UPDATE ME ON PROGRESS
<3
hell, one of the newbies that come in earlier is 10!

8,1my dog keeps farting in his sleep
lol
I hate it when they do that
Well, I tried Pingtest... first time, an F-- second time an A.

8,1SuperBrony64: my mental image of you is of a short, ginger, leprechaun
Kencolt: hmmm
10,02Hahaha

8,1Phase4: he followed my into my bedroom, and decided to sleep on the floor
10,02O U

8,1i can't shift him
SB64: No fears. I never had that image.
so its a big dog
10,02Alright, 5 seconds is all you get
8,1and now he's asleep and he won't stop farting and my room stinks now

Kencolt: no, I meant the actual numbers you got, click the share button on the results
O_O

Oh, again? I don't really fell like it at the moment-- usually, things work OK, I'm not woried.
I see nothing but buffer circle: the revenge

Everpinnning in the blue. m Or rather black.

8,1SuperBrony64: actually, you do have really nice eyes
10,02Thanks ^_^

8,1indeed
They freaking GLOW. And I have spinning lag circle again.
Kencolt: your reaction, was PRICELESS
I'd SHOOT it! What is THAT?
10,02:P

10,02So, how did I look?
lol yup... screencapture worked
umm, surprised tobh
tbh

10,02lol
I see no stream. I see a face... a strange face... and a circle of lag.
hmmm, i'ma try something. brb
you look... human... WHERE IS DA PONY!!
it's not a cirlce of lag
Buffering caounts as lag.
it's RETURN OF THE BUFFER 2: THE BUFFERING
Whatever. the point is IT'S THERE.
8,1i heard a terrible joke today
yay! jokes!
yeah, he's setting it back up it seems
8,1three old biddies were sitting on a park bench, when a naked stripper walked past
8,1one of them has a stroke, but the other two couldn't reath
8,1*rech
8,1*reach

I had a joke that would only make sense to anyone who played Final Fantasy 11 Online-- but damn, the players there loved it.
okay, shoot

welcome to "Where's and what is the stream?" With your host, SB64, the Man without a Cable.
8,1a nun with a javelin through he back running through a barn at near C
lol
gah... math joke...
but Kencolts' comment is lol worthy
10,02Glad you all liked my face on stream >_<
i got a joke, or more of a limrick...
is it a dirty limrick?
8,1otakon: it's a modification of "what's black and white and doesn't fit through doorways" but with the barn door relativistic thought experiment
10,02Time for YouTube
yes otakon
I seem to have... disturbed... someponies here tonight when they realised my... age.
Kencolt: no disturbing, just wowing really
SB you are getting lazy lately.........
10,02Lazy?! D:
lol
8,1Kencolt: disturbed? morelike turbed.
tb utterly honest, surprised.
10,02Why? ;____;
you stream less videogame and more youtube
dat Braeburn
I can't really relate to your surprise. Why shouldn't a 54 year old southyern male be a brony?
SB SB SB SB SB SB
10,02Hai!
8,1dat braeburn
8,1<3
Fluttershys Lantment :3
do ettttt
8,1braeburn x macintosh is sexiest ship
Kencolt: well, I said earlier the show MUST have something going for it.
ok, so a man goes out to the bar to drink but only finds one bar near his home. not wanting to travel to get drinks he enters and finds that it is a gay bar. not really caring he walks up to the bar and sits, then asks the bartender for a drink.
oh boy
i'm back, didnt work
it didnt work'
oh well
i worked
you might want to repeat your letter for Vivi-- it was something of a hoot. ^_^
:O?
suddenly this image again
i
That is a disturbing pony image. Not sure why-- maybe it's the navel.
oh god
dear god this song
not this one
wut is this?
Let's Get Creative!
/me *mute*
Kencolt: it's the humanization of it I think a bit
ding me when the song is over
I don't know
I muted it too
It's the navel. It's SOO much the navel.
I want to sleep sometime today
hello i am new here im a brony and someone recommended i come here
11,01Now I am done with Saints Row 3.
Ponies are NOT naturally outies.
it's a ring
the bartender walks over and says 'i'll only sell you drinks if you tell me the name of your penis.' the man seems confused but is thirsty so he turns to the man on his left and asks what his penis' name is, then the man on his right. after some time the man calls for the bartender again. 'So, what's its name then?' the man looks at the bartender and says 'Its name is Secret, strong enough for a man but made for a woman'
08,14Kencolt. . . leteter? i am mial pony
A... Okay. That's even MORE off.
no on my screen it just a grey block
'otakon, what was that letter again?
internet explorer
hold on
I can't seem to find it
Because it did flatter me somewhat.
well theres your problem
10,02Are you at http://www.bronystate.net?
yes
aww... well... guess i wont tell a joke like that again... T_T
11,01You could pastebin it.
Dear Princess Celestia, I learned to listen to my elders today. They got to be elders for a reason. Your faithful student, otakon
11,01Instead of posting a wall of text.
firefox and chrome are good
i will try mozilla and see if it works
o_o
And Vivi-- I'm the elder in question.
eeyup
Except she seems to be gone.
I don't think she caught that though
she flits in and out
10,02It's okay, I'm glad you're here Kencolt ^_^
so eloquent XD
damn this guy sucks
And on a different note-- WHAT IS THIS?
ok its working now
... and then it was 2 am... but I got my ATG for tomorrow done
Kencolt: Rhythm game
10,02Rhythm Heaven Fever on Wii
wow you go big guy lol

10,02That guy really sucks though...
if you suck to bad it shows you
Ah. As in, like every Wii game, it makes little sense?
10,02Well, this game especially doesn't make sense.
8,1two fish are in a tank. one turns to the other and says, "do you have any idea how to drive this thing?"
Kencolt: nah, this was a DS game bfore
08,14I will be streaming it along with SuperBrony64. . .

ponies handling rackets is unlegit enough, i stop thinking there
sweetiebelle looks like a dog in this...
again Phase4, it involves pinkie, logic is disregarded
http://b.asset.soup.io/asset/2356/7403_85cb.png
8,1Phase4: true about the ding, but it's actually a really really nice client
Twilight playing PingPong with a totally unlikely utensil-- seems proper to me.
8,1okay, well

mpore or less
You mean adorkable.

how is she doing that shes launching the 2 apples seperately
twilight can be pretty adorkable
So cute.

/me glomps Fleur
10,02Phase4: Nope, because I choose what comments I say carefully ^_^
Futashy made me scared of fluttershy
8,1hey Fleur!
8,1how goes?
well, today yeah... but not before
no one told me!
8,1what's Futashy?
SQUEE
i do that sometimes Phase4, then i realize it wasnt actually me but either one of my other many personalities or someone attempting to infiltrate my life in order to assassinate me and everyone i'm acquainted with
/me was reading stuff she couldnt remember typing
Tru dat Fleur
ok im looking at the rules now.
I didnt DC did I?
Ingwaz: you should see someone about that
well....i did....and then they were killed
:O

/me must watch the dark night through properly
8,1Midnight_Tempest: wait, i just found out what it is and now i do regret it
freEEEEEEEEEEENCH

Speaking fancy
you know....since i dont speak french, its kind of entertaining to imagine them bad mouthing and swearing at each other
pinkie is singing fancy
/me hopes she didnt DC aGAIN
Oh god, may I suggest French Flutterguy Evil Enchantress?
Fleur: nope, your online
damn caps
echooooo
french flutterguy is too sexy for the chat to handle
I will not watch or look at any MLP fanfics without properly studying them... I regret stumbling upon Cup... Nvm.
yay I didnt DC
8,1i mean, i don't mind sexy ponies, but when they're really graphic and, well, ridiculous, it kinda makes me uneasy
we do not speak of it Dashie_Dashie
10,02Alright, going to grab some food
:O
10,02Enjoy this Pony playlist I found
what.. no applebloom no!
Lol
SuperBrony64: ....why is this the one you picked....
8,1i mean, i'm fine with grimdark, and... the fanfic that shall not be named
/me is a little wierded out
SuperBrony64. I've read the rules.

oh? thats all? i ran in to that a long time ago on accident
idk how to get back tho.
every fandom has the gruesom side, the more popular the more of it exists
i'd rather run in to futashy than some seriously grimdark stuff
10,02Hai KiDtehEPiC

mmmk
okie dokie lokie
guess what!!!!
what
i think i found Derpy in the weeks episode D:
neat-o
*proud*
Just finished reading My Little Dashie.
/me pats Baka-Neku on the back
many tears were shed
;_;
IKR
i cried of happiness D:
I'm happy crying right now
oh god I'm bawing
so much joys
:(
I'm a grown brony.
a big guy, and i'm bawing like a baby.
You OK Rainbow Dash? Anything i can do to HALP?
i fell asleep 40 min before the episode
:(
poor thing
darn that story!
i have somthing that will change your lives forever
ready to hear it
I'm defintely bookmarking that, and I'll read all the time.
sure
blah
its the password of life
I have one of those
Blue Light And houses
Blah
no one likes poor spike =(
I don't
I luvz da little guy
awwwww
your the odd one out
I lost it when he was reading the album where Dashie left him the note.
everyone else doesnt =(
I like Spike! he's the only character from the original :D
well technicly they are all from the originals
Pretty sure thts not true
Rarity's based on Majesty, but other than that, nope
pinkie pie has the coat and mane of a G3 pegasus
and name
or somthing
ect
Those are NOT the originals XD
well
the not originals
dont make me cry :'(
I was sad that they renamed Wisteria from HER G3 pony
now that derpy has talked dr hooves needs to be the new wheres pony
You now know her as Cherilee, the schoolteacher...
Yeah, I found this site watching you guys TOTALLY LOSE YOUR HEADS when Derpy was named
good times
:((((((((((((((((
i will miss derpy being the wheres waldo
dr hooves needs to fill derpys shoes
horse shoes
I think she'll still be the where's waldo
fanservice lives
once you talk you will never be the same
i hope lauren faust makes dr hooves appear in a flash of light or somthing in a hidden spot
and dissapear a few secs after
nah, if they meant to make a habit of it, they'd've picked some lucky punk to voice hir
tabitha
puh-lease this show has a nack for disregarding the predetermined lines
and, uh, since nobody seems sure if Derpy is male or female...
shes female
stallions almost always have a head like a hair dryer
lol
OMFG way to totally stereotype
maybe, since she... or he... sounded a little yellow bus special
She
he just finds it easier to let his gorgeous mane flow free >.>'
she
im kinda upset how they made derpy abit to derped
stop disregarding the S
when she spoke
Derpy has female eye lashes, so therefore it's a she. :>
Pony logic.
plus her head does not look like a hairdryer
is best logic
I'm not disregarding it, I'm referring to the possibility that it could be male. Though... mostly teasingly, because yes, boyponies always have really distinct characteristics.
yeh a headryer
lol
In fact, if you go by the ponies you can buy...there's like two boys for a hundred girls
I might have to do a youtube reading for My little Dashie, seeing as some people are annoying commentators.
pretty much how a real horse herd works, so
do eet
hold on just abit of question here?
hmm?
why are there millions of female ponys
but few and far males
because science
because it was a franchise directed at, and for, girls
Big Mac get's all the flank.
almost EXCLUSIVELY until this recent brony crazy
lol
craze
eeeeeyup
all the girls be loving big mac
especially Molestia.
Anyone else weirded out by Rarity being.... late teens to 20s? ish? flirting with and manipulating Spike, a baby dragon who's just turned a year old?
XD
OH DEAR GOD.
inter-species
jingles
dragons age slower than ponies
not what that long, agile tongue is foooor (I saw what he did with that cupcake)
so it's even worse!
Not to mention Spike can INSTA-GROW.
That's not mental state
Spike's been with twi since she was just a filly so he's probably not tht much younger
we saw, if anything, his mental state deteriorates
yeh
and more often than not he can be the more adult of them all
hey has anyone seen how in his daydreams he was always a bipedal civilized dragon guy type thing
also, i apologize in advance should my typing deteriorate.. ambien makes you hallucinate just a little bit
oh god..
With big muscles and a sword?
but when puberty becomes a bitch for him hes a monster
everytime I see rainbow dash now I get teary eye'd
;_;
maybe dragons turn different according to mental states
IKR
if they dont become greedy
i totally knew as soon as he started collecting... "DRAGONHOARD!"
they grow up bipedal and civilized
grow up greedy
monstaaaah
Maybe, who knows...
/me curls up, sleeps and looks cuddly and huggable
Donald Trump is now Spike.
lol
The dragon Fluttershy scolded seemed speechless, but intelligent
-huggeth thy pony-
nuuu spike is cute and deserves cuddles
/me hugs ishy
trump only needs a thirty thousand volt cattle prod to the taint
I sence a disturbance....
in the farce?
/me hugs Ish
id rather be a bipedal civilized dragon if i was in the mlp universe
...i'd rather be a pony
if i was a dragon
I'd rather be a party Streamer
...someday
id be a zapapple tree
or pinkie's party cannon <3
bai everypony
nuuuu...kbai
seaponies need to be introduced
and everyone cried.....
for 12 seconds
/me hugs HeavyMetalDash
you mean merponies
no
<3
moar pegacorns
moaaaaaarrrr
Alicorn
Those are only the two actual princesses, supposedly
alicorn
correct terminoligy
according to who, terry brooks? XD
looks like another Ajax episode this saturday.
.__.
the dictionary of mythical creatures vol.6
alicorns ftw
does it say anything about the phi kasue?
tho in babycakes the unicorn could fly through magic.....
unicorn ftw
they're vampires, but they don't suck blood
sounds unhealthy
lol jingles u reminded me of twilight
they shove their tongue up your ass in their sleep and SLURP OUT YOUR FECES
do they drink the color red?
lets me vege vampires
so... you know, JUST like Twilight
hey heavy
yea?
theres a game called the void where these women drink colour
lol awesome
search it up and love it
its an epic game
i've played that game, but it wasn't on the psp... it was on the lsd
I wan't to drink the color green
it tastes like licorice
theres nerva and somthing else
in the void
that game you have no clue
what your doing
lol
and everything makes you go what the everfree forest
Lol if I was still in high school...
damn, do those still exist?
Show MLD in english, make everyone BAWWW, get an easy A
I would be best highschool brony
i thought they'd gone right to prison camps these days
I'm ok with this.
Closet Brony no more.
if someone starts livestreaming ask them to livestream the void
I add elements of harmony to every periodic table now
^
but.. are they heavy metals? XD
they are heaviest metals!
I dunno
they hold the most weight to me <3
Pinkie's ... probably nitrous oxide -.-
why dident i get a big crown thingy =(
shes helium
And Fluttershy would be something elusive and fluffy
and nitrous oxide
yeah, i think she's pretty much inspired by nitrous
lol
she's even the color that it tastes like
(synesthesia rocks)
Rainbow dash is light hooved, but as hard as a rock
what element would she be?
i am painting pinkie pie
it is not going well
mercury duh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_wZZ8SaLVU
watch this if you wanna learn about the void
HIGHLY POISONOUS too XD
that game were people eat colours and you constantly go wtf
makes sence
Applejack'd probably be... carbon.
Everywhere, basic, important, solid.
dawwww very fitting
and Rarity's gold, silver, platinum... all the shiny things, oooooOOOooo
lawl
who is everyone's best pony?
<---Pinkie hardcore
Screw Ball
And Fluttershy should be... idunno, something also light and fluffy and elusive.
Argon?
XD
THIS PICTURE
DAWWWWWWWWWWW

lol
So I can't manage to convince my mum that it's mostly guys who watch MLP
is anyone watching the void
Show her... bronycon.
no, as i try to avoid chaos vents
right
....that works to both, really
whelp....I'm thinking that I either have to A work on my OC and watch MLP or B Play my guitar and watch MLP
win/win
either way
i'm amazed there's a bronycon when the show's only been on a year xD
IKR f'ing decisions
Bronycon, less than 6 hours from where I live this year.
where is it/
TOTALLY GOING *squee*
New york city
i haven't driven six hours for a con since... uh. Otakon '05
Y canada have no bronycon or even regular meetups?
because lame canadiananans haven't arranged any?
whar in canada dusk thou reside?
I is feel secluded up here
Manitoba
soooo you have to worry about REAL Wendigo
Wendigo in ancient indian lore was chopped into tiny bits and turned into misquitoes
That's like a 14-16 hour drive for bronycon o.o
*acquire plane tickets*
yes, but a wendigo is created when a man's heart freezes and he turns into a cannibalistic monster.
I can't no moar money to spend If I wanna make my anime convention perhaps next year...sigh
furfest is turning into a mini ponythang
I feel ya.. Jobless as of now, got laid off.
which is kind of awesome
sucks being 19. @_@
someday, you'll look back at yourself and LAUGH for that statement
indeed
you might even laugh hard enough that you need a new colostomy bag
Most likely.
I'll read My little dashie when I'm 50 though.
baw.
die peacefully
indeed
why can i picture Pinkie as some kind of dr. kevorkian?
I need a dash plushie to snuggle now
feeding people special koolaid
me to D:
to the interent! wowthatwasfast
I wish I walked around town and found a filly dashie in a box.
I'm already here!
suddenly, heart explodes 20x fold
well good... uh, morning, actually... folks. but yeah. what's the female equiv to a brohoof? A doehoof? i mean, odd toed vs. even toed, but...
Brohoof is still brohoof.
regardless of gender.
Brohoof disregards gender and acquires everypony
^
no, sorry, in addition to being too female, i'm too WHITE, and if i said bro anything i'd get my ass kicked
Well I'm gonna head off, it's getting late and all this bawing has tired me out.
night bronies.
y u so self consiouce back in my day I would stand a beating for anything I luved
and yet here I am today

it r epical
Which episode is that?

I speculated over the weekend, givin that RD has shown she has a hard time keeping still, when she realizes she has to stay in that hospital bed, she'll try to make a run for it, winding up hiding in the library before getting caught. somepony sees her and gives her a book to read which she takes back to her room, having nothing else to do....she reads.
spongebob'

Phas4: Why would you TRY to download something?
xcanox: ?????
yes but i never downloaded a steam skin >.>
what am i trying to download?
I need stronger coffee so I can use the Keureg
Trying implies failure, and you're more likely to win 1$ from the lottery than get a failed download.
Unless you manually screw it up.
shhhh Star Wars ad
/me is super confused about what xcanox is saying
:D
:D
*implies the possibility of failure
OHH... MY.... 3D STAR WARS.....
Suddenly, bad man.

Suddenly Batman burst from the shade and hit Gozilla with a Bat-grenade...

Oh look a stream

arrowtobroknee: i believe that's supposed to be scootaloo in the background
Ictiv: it's a judgment call really
Octovia is best sea pon.
you can't use rating as an absolute indicator
shu bi do
"good" - A; "meh" - A/B to be debated if/when it gets picked. "bad" - B
MirrorImage: I know, but Sumica told me to check IMDb

alternatively, you might consider googling "List of B Movies" and see if it pops up
00,10chances are if it's both lower score and or low budget it will be counted as A B movie

Shy: It's good you have Vinyl though. I for one have the Narrator who just loves to critisize me on every turn. But I know he's a great guy and is just messing with me.... *Wanders of jabbering on about nonsense*
00,10still echo
Like I said though, Vinyl and Kimiko are representational of each other and myself in the comic, so it's basically a comic about finding comfort in myself. c:
Echoy still
hello
Shy: Oh I know
The Narrator is my evil second personality
00,10it almost sounds like your mic is picking up your speakers
My critical self

/me wishes she could have made it to the Alive 2007 tour
"Why are you so frozen" ->Insta Lightning
Who was frozen today?
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Knows
I was frozen today!
it knows
FluttershyOHYEAH11: and I dont know why people like dubstep
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC8zz95rm8s
dat Michael Bay
You've got a little quiet just now
oh thank god there's people here who don't like dubstep
I despise it
dubstep is awful
depends, do you mean dubstep or that stuff skrillex puts out?
/me just found a new friend
/me is liking the chat atm <3
I don't even know what Dubstep is to be honest... SI it that kind of "music" that is made of a beat and a... So the music that is made of a beat?
both
Dubstep to me sounds like "friday"
it sounds like a baby being beaten to death by a half dead moose in a meat grinder
it doesnt count as music
it counts as som ass dicking around in FL
kill him bro
Fleur: Ah... Okay, I think I'll go listen to a little Cole Porter now
KILL HIM
Or maybe Jeremy Soule
Cole Porter ftw
the stuff skrillex does is brostep, or there's a drop in the song and goes bass heavy
lol it looked like metro for a second there
S´ serious sam any good?
what I hate most about dubstep, the people who listen to it think that anything electronic = dubstep
Oh, mouse noise
Fleur: Same
>be listening to "Plasma"
but that's just ignorant people
>someone comes up "I didnt know you like dubstep!" :D
>throw table at their head
Fleur: Yeah like when I'm enjoying my Doctor Who, people claim it to be a Sci-Fi
Except in this version, Both are good
I tend to relate only to things that are good
Prolongs the life you know
/me hasnt tried to classify Doctor Who yet
6_9
indeed
/me power watches anime on netflix
/me realizes that she only watches good anime on netflix
That was way too much emotion for his character
Show us one of your french mares
Spice and Wolf, Desert Punk, Popotan, Mushi-shi, Gurren Lagann, Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop, ect. shall I go on?
OH LOL
:3c
"Paniponi Dash!" was a good anime but I never got to finish it :(
^love it
Wow, youre computer loads Slooow man :O
same here Fleur
I have a quick question: Is any answer to the question "Is the answer to this question" either a paradox or indecisive?
/me plucks Dken2021's cowlick and watches him deflate
Is th answer to this question no?"*
yes
Fleur: Why?
wha?
because no
Actually, you can asnwer "Not Really"
Not Really=/=No
/me twists mustache.
and play the game already
/me plays final fantasy V in the background
That's what you get if you put a Raymond Smullyan book in the hands of someone like me :D
have you ever looked up, while falling down, while in an area where direction is negligable?
KEIKAKU DOORI
why did the little girl fall out of the swing?
Up and Down and All Around?
Fleur: Technically yes. Simply because question implies that a down direction exists, even if not for the area but relative to you
She had no arms.
Hi Ictiv.
Hey xcanox
10 min of loading screen xD
DubZbrony: What are you playing?
but there is no sort of marker around you and if you turn you will be falling in a new direction. If you can even say you are falling and not instead accending, or not moving at all.
Fleur I think this answers your question: http://youtu.be/dzBW9n313xw
Thank you, thoug It seems you didn't hear demolition derby announcments before :D
If there is no marker around you, how do you know which direction you are moving? How do you know you are moving at all?
Fleur: You don't.
All kind of stuff, Tf2, Css, MW3, Warcraft, Starcraft, stuff like that
Fleur: Better question: How do you know you are looking at a scree right now?
screen*
technically, I dont
I dream that I am chatting here all the time. I am not sure if this is real or fiction
Fleur: Conclusion?
"Who cares, Let's have fun people!"ú
What the eck´ saying youre something out of the Matrix or sum oO
Reality is what you make of it
^ that too
And I make reality look good
Get to the Choppa!
lol
gtg bye
Cya FluttershyOHYEAH11 :)
bye FluttershyOHYEAH11
Run!
do any of you have an optomistic nature while being generaly pesemistic?
Must be hard playing, when half the game is Loading screens xD
Fleur: Me
Or maybe the other way around
unsure
I think the world is too stupid to be nice to itself, but I don't let that stop me from loving who I am and being nice to who I can be nice to
/me will say that something will probably go wrong but doesnt worry because she knows that it will all be ok in the end
^
00,10Expect the best prepair for the worst
Though I DO say that it will be good in the end
exactly Sumica!
:D
Besides. Everyone is so shook up when people talk about the end of civilization
/me is always ready for failure but works her damn hardest to prevent it
No one seems to notice the the universe works just fine with its beautiful nebulas and gravitational fields and time distortions without us moping about
yea just shoot for the Muzzle Flashe
I am not. I can handle myself
besides, I make friends with extrordinary ease
Say somethign Spy worthy
why don't you save before the fight
Strelok Dolmes
besides, civilization will always be here so long as there are two creatures that are near eachother
Tried turning up the Gamma, or brightness in game? oO, works for me when i cant see anything
Hello to all~
hi Nyria
hi
maybe three creatures
Fleur: Unless those two creatures are a Seagull and a tuna
What are we watching?~
Looks like a Metro game~
their civilization will be based on war Ictiv
-_- oh
also, that is why I said maybe 3
because one will have to chose a side
Hm...
sleep until day
ohai Nyria
Actualyl I can see a story forming here...
Hey ScootaChicken ~
my reactions are so delayed...
Hmm sorry then, was the only advice i could come up with =/
Nyria...
A Seagull, a Tuna and a dog
Inb4 tidle~
your poor tilde key
nope
inaft4
No, foget about the Tuna and the Seagull! They don't exist! They are all in the imagination of the Dog!
"Woah, that is beautiful, look at me, I'm tearing up, just look at me!"
oh snap, bartz hometown been sucked to the void, he's mad crazy now
(Anyone got "The Majestic" refference there?)
No?
Nyria: Yup
each will either leave eachother alone (civilization based on respecting space), war over land/food (civilization bassed on war), or they will work together (civilization bassed on cooperation).
They can also mix the civilizations
Fleur: Ah. I thought everythign else was dead in this scenario
plants = food
lol, no u did not!
Fleur: Did you see a Seagull eat plants?
also, I said three
I do that all the time in fallout~
haha, Good luck finding it
Scootaloo is NOT a chicken!!
if only two then they can not mix the civilizations
We need a good third
Hm...
I know!
Doctor Who!
Ictiv: it would if it was bucking hungry
its night in the game man
Got no Nightvision? oO
DubZbrony: [11:49] maybe three creatures
He'd surely check out such a scenario
ohai xcanox
Can his sonic screw driver hypnotize like The Master's?
Or even better:
Doctor Who would love such a scenario
Doctor Who gives two Fob Watches to the Seagull and Tuna
That would get me to Ragequit right about now :p
and they become Time Gull and Timena
Doctor doctor~
Doctor Doctor is best UFO song
Timey wimey chicken of the sea
/me does the awesome s:Ot
dat :o
/me jumps on Ictiv from behind and stabs him ninja assassin style
:o

You said invernerable and the only thing I've never been able to hit was a ghost..

8
8 is my lucky number
00,108 if you can do it while drunk
Sumica: I'm Always drunk on life
And I once sung it to a crowd of folks I knew when I was kinda sorta also drunk on other things
That's a pretty good super power, 8 it is
Kinda sorta as in the way: Believe me, I can't get drunk

Oh well

Not really
not really
Not too much

00,10Curse you Tor why must you have so many elevator bosses
Game audio is drowning out your narration again , isnt there an ingame option to reduce volume ? whatever you did before seems to have reversed itself
brb
depends on sound set up bro
Ring ring ring
there are options to change which music feeds through which speaker and adjust as such

Like that Ikea mare?
/me smiles from ear to ear.....literally

Stuff
Kammerjunk: You werent
You were quoting a character she played

Me
Dat technicality.
Ictiv: But then she still said it in the play.
Hi all

Cello there
LunaTheBeloved: Did you build ur amusment park yet?
Kammerjunk: Because Pinkie Pie is best actor
oh, wait
She was just posing as somepony else meanwhile.
Still working on it
Luna controls the moon, so why didn't she just crash it into Equestri-THREE DAYS
Luna is moon goddess, derp
And I transported materials from Equestria
Kammerjunk: Exactly, so what he said was not what she thought
You know what she thought?
/me boards next shuttle to the moon
Ictiv: She thought about cupcakes.
Or just cakes.
Or chocolate.
Or icecream.
I can't get the stream... it's loading infinitely...
Or parties.

One way to check... Everypony: Type "SuperBrony64"
/me feels unhugged on the moon.
/me hugs Lasharus
/me wants to taste haggis
/me starts eating atronaut food..
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved. 'yay'
Being Danish means that I don't get to dress up as a skeleton on Nightmare Night and scare trick-and-treaters, or celebrea
8,1i've got my haggis boiling, my neeps are are almost done, and my tatties are mashed
0,14goooooooood afternoon everyone

Ugh, stupid ads that make me click video and send me somewhere else.

/me goes and tosses a rope to rainbowheaven
13how did you get in there?
8,1that's Burns' Address to a Haggis
...Uhh, I find don't think I should be watching DerpyHooves do that. But I cant look away.
I was exploring. sry my first time on the moon!
8,1which is his celebration of our great delicacy
Since it seems there is no stream, I'm going to take a moment to give you all a piece of perfection:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m3IB7N_PRk
Cheftain Pudding, lovely :)
8,1the poem actually ends saying basically "if you want to impress a girl, give her a haggis"
That would impress me
/me falls down well and will be back out in about 5 minutes
Haggis... if my recollection of Samurai Jack is correct, isn't that "Sheep's stomach?"
pretty much MirrorImage
Do I need to refresh to see stream or is it down for everyone?
its one of the most horrible things to come out of Fair Scotland
Heh, MirrorImage, that's how I learn what Haggis is too.
StinkomanFan: It's down for me
don't listen to him
ScootaChicken!
8,1here's the entire poem, and a translation: http://www.worldburnsclub.com/poems/translations/address_to_a_haggis.htm
/me hug
/me wonders what SuperBrony64 is doing...
StinkomanFan!
8,1MirrorImage, ScootaChicken, no
hmm?
8,1it's boiled in a sheep's stomach as casing
8,1but that's no worse than sausages
8,1which are cased in pig's intestines
"boiled in a sheep's stomach" - what kind of leap of faith comes up with that idea?
I found something weird.

8,1i mean, at least poop doesn't go there, y'know?
in case u don't know what "ashew" is, it's wut apple jack's snoring sound in Look Before you Sleep

rainbowheaven: Strangest thing though, she had on this weird dress of cutie marks, and a horn neckless...
/me goes to get a snack. "i'm srsly gettin a snack.."
8,1it was basically a mechanical scanning method
Without black people there would be no potato chips
8,1you had a rotating disc with holes spiralling out from the centre
Well we invented...............I dunno, did we invent something?
I learned that on Noggin
NO POTATO CHIPS!
0,14I used to think i was part Irish because I was born on St. Patrick's Day
8,1and you used that rotating very fast to scan your image
I could live without potato chips honestly
8,1similar arrangement on the other end to reproduce the image
I'll take a potato chip.....AND EAT IT!
IshBestPony: You wouldn't :O
0,14Salt and vinegar chips are best chips :3

Am I the only Pegasister in the chat room?
I am
one too
far from it
YAY!
howdy
Cello there
quite a few ladies in this community here
heyo appiejack
I tend to avoid the term 'pegasister' altogether. Despite its origins, as far as I'm concerned 'brony' is genderless.
bronystate y u no put AJ smilies in here :(
well i know of matilda and the chocolatefactory merely by name , and thats the movies , not knowing foreign childrens book authors is probably an excusable gap in my knowledge of the world
yay, i like the ladies
none for you
Lasharus: that's because the internet itself is genderless
(Plus, it just sounds ridiculous. Yes, I know, but really)
WE NEED APPLEJACK SMILIES!!!
^
*rageface*
the backlash over "Pegasister" is "omg women are trying to assert themselves," etc
Wha?
*Wrek's voice* No all caps
What.
hi
WB rainbowheaven
Wb rainbowheaven
hey rainbowheaven ^_^
Not really MirrorImage. I just dislike the term because it sounds ridiculous.
what rule is it of the internet? "There are no women on the internet. Children are actually FBI agents."
Wrek?!?!
the gender ratio in this chat is slowly tipping one way
Hi person I dont know!
even when not here Wrek controls the all caps...
0,14yep
i hear you but i can't see you!!
Oh right, it's sexism. Oh deary me.
Hi everyone. i'm back!
I think I'll just back out of this conversation entirely before I say a few things others will regret.
oak taught wrek how to do it
Hai rainbowheaven

I heard SuperBrony64 is a pretty cool guy, eh streams stuff and doesn't afraid of anything

Alright guys I have to go

See y'all laterz
bai lunathebeloved
/me is out in the cholcolate puddled with a giant swivel straw
yes, but a penny is a stealth kill
10,02:D
bai LunaTheBeloved
you can see a brick coming at you
*puddles
Hey everypony
good luck seeing a penny
Hi Brawny
0,14I think it's actually illegal to chuck pennies off the ESB
true, but what if you throw a LOT if bricks
10,02Hai Brawny!
you can't kill someone by dropping a penny off the esb
"illegal," i doubt it. against the building rules, certainly
/me glomps LunaTheBeloved
SaxyPretender: Is it illegal to chuck bricks then?
0,14...I would think so
What happens when ou throw an ANVIL off the empire state building?
Presumably
*you
security could probably throw you out of the building if they caught you, but i doubt that you can actually be charged for it
unless that penny manages to crack a skull
10,02It's illegal to chew gum in front of a liquor store in San Francisco
XD
why?
thats retarded
It won't. It's too small to fight the air resistance to get to those speeds
It's illegal to sleep in the nude in Minnesota.
I think it is illegal to tie a giraffe to a parking meter in some state too
XDDD
again, i propose bricks or other large heavy objects
XD
A giraffe? Really? xD
10,02And, yeah, I made up that fact :P
XD
I didn't make mine up
Unfortunately
LunaTheBeloved is gone?! omg she left!

70% of statistics are madde up
or he left. i'm not sure
10,02Because you all are SILLY FILLIES

The one about the giraffe is true, it was made in Chicago in 1962
I'm not a filly!

Im only 72 % Silly Filly , the other 77% are Muffin+

10,02Hai Sauceboss
oh lawd, it actually took me about 5 minutes to find a video of The Contact's cover of Major Tom(Coming Home)
I feel hipster
IT WAS ALL CAPS
hi super
Stallion is a male adult horse , the equivalent of a filly would be a colt right ? and foal is used for both male and female babys ?
yep
Yes
Yes it was, Sauce
what you know bout equestrians?
ah okay
I want to see it again.
o3o
I remember seeing some people I recognized on it
so dat was pretty interesting
The chat went crazy once derpy appeared
I saw the chatroom frenzy on YouTube.
Sauceboss, it was the Pinkie Pie room, not the mane chat
Thats why I'm here.
ah okay
xD
of course Pinkie's room goes crazy
what's this about pinkie_pie chat?
the mane chat was somehow even more chaotic...
:)
me too Gal
so the youtubes brought people here?
Yup.
well kinda
I came from filly
and one of the guys dere was in the youtube chat video
xD
:D
10,02Oh nice! We got kettle corn on campus today :D
still, the fact that we get new people from the video is pretty cool
oh god lol
dat was a legendary moment in our history
of course mang
what video?
I was hit in the head by a bible today. :D
oh teh reaction video?
dem Bibles is no joke mang
Sauceboss: that just makes you wonder what the next "legendary" moment will be for us
08,14hoym
aww yeah

i think the next "legendary" moment might be Octavia being named and speaking
That was the 5th time my head was hit by a bible.

Question, who is ________________ ?
My cat eats my mom's earplugs and my brother's nerf darts
every browser has its own pros and cons
/me reports Nyria for tilde abuse
i eat chimicherrychongas
for example, internet explorer is good at downloading other browsers
MY cat just sleeps, that's all it does all day long
I use Firefox because I can't bother learning the do's and don'ts of a new browser, and the Goddesses know I won't use IE.
Oh Dumorimasoddaa, that's my third strike~!
ekips: and thats it
Eeeyup~~
^
Though I do have money... So I can indeed bypass the rules~
ekips: And technologically impaired ducks.
I'm going to play some MW3, who wants to play with me?
IE is shit... dont know why my college uses it
Nyria >;O!!!
because it's expendable?
guess...
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes, I'll see you on the dark side of the moon~
Oh Starflash, what did I do this time?~
our school also uses internet explorer, but we never had any virus scanners either so im not surprised
You're paying people to get ye out of jail~~
they waste money though.. cause people using IE end up smashing the computers
