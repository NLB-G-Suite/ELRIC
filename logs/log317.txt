Motek
13sailor moon was pretty much built out of machinas
*Motel

Saturn: i think you can get transatlantic flights one way for <$100; and there's always cheap hotels if you know where to look
11,01I live in PA.
0,5otakon He wasnt leaving he was saying help silly
[$(5)$]
I'M RICH!
8,1MirrorImage: the cheapest transatlantic flights i've seen are upwards of £300
8,1each way
0,5No but really I cant have someone in my house, I am but a 16 year old >_<
highjack a plain: free flights anywhere.
*plane
damn it
though i have heard reports that the best time to book flights is 6 weeks before the flight itself
back...
8,1but i might be looking in the wrong places
8,1LordCelestia: just say i'm a... immigrant slave?
8,1i dunno
I always book a good 2-3 months before flights
maybe thats a tad early
0,5x3
11,01If I happen to still be in State College, I have an apt and State College has an airport.
...
hYAHOOZ
D:
iS BACK
11,01Yeah. I'm about to calculate times.
8,1okay, looks like accomodation shouldn't be a problem
8,1now all i need to do is build a gigantic catapulty
no idea
oh look it's that other alicorn
That would just be silly.
11,01New York is only 4 hours 13 mins from State College.
11,01I-99 to I-80 straight there.
yep
11,01Because I'm graduating this Spring.
:O Oh wow!
cool ^_^
debating on going
yeah
11,01I take Rainbow Dash.
I'd like to go too
but I has no monies atm
If only I had the skills ;^;
9,1Wish I had the time and resources for a decent cosplay...
i just wish I could sew.
Faaaaaaaaar away.
Amaaazing!
:3
IKR
That would be epic
or at the very least a group meet-up
Sorry I got nothing to say...yet that is haha
Awww.
I always hide my power level whenever I go outside.
Going to a con like that would be like going SS3
then dont
That's just ridiclious.
11,01Well, like I said, I'm truly not a convention person.
I'd rather not.
11,01I figure conventions are for the high-end fans.
maybe it's time to go to the neighbouring country to the sotuh
I never went to any kind of con, but wish to go to one
south*
i wouldnt mind conventions, but i dont have th money for the hotel, travel fees, and all the money i would want to spend on the merch
That, and I can't get to NY easily.
11,01And I'm introverted.
And I have no money.
i watched the livestream from like 10 am cst to 19:00 cst
I'm staying right here.
:(
Faaaaaaaar away from all that nonsense.
11,01He brought back a couple of good print including an awesome Rarity pic.
They focused on the weird people
that's Fox for you
Why Fox news would even BOTHER to cover that is beyond me.
Its not the right kind of community, if you ask me. But whatever.
Any other news station BUT FOX.
news reaactions?]
Why did they have to focus on the weird ones?
meh, alot of these reports are Biased
or all that AMAZING MUSIC
Beyond that, no real rasin.
rasins are not real. canon
Bluh.

O.O
11,01Isn't all American news stations like that now?
Pretty much

but mostly the ones that have slow news
Kim Kardashian isn't married!
CNN does whatever the fuq they want. Not in a good way
lol

I rather like CNN, they were tolerable
oh me!
^
CNN is the only news group that tries to tell you about the outside world... but not well enough
<endrant<
>
I don't watch the news
There'd have to be news
It's not worth complaining over.
i ignore everything... ignorance is bliss
Giants

11,01New team makes the superbowl.
I can't wait for Tebow to suck next year and thene everybody to complain about him.
11,01?
(well, next to last)

Youmay have to get used to the texture-- but the flavor...

8,1i'm trying to settle an argument.
8,1yup
8,1perfectly edible
were they healthy?
If they died, it's not probably safe meat.
yeah
8,1we're assuming yes
too risky
if it died of natural causes
well if it edible ill give it a try
umm
you eat Guinea Pigs?
WHY!?
anyone has ever tried horse meat?
O.O
I haven't
....Not I.
but I hear you have to stew it
because horseflesh is damn tough
N-not the guinea pigs
you just use it like cows meat
D:
Horse or Guinea Pig?
That, or as has been noted, long stewed.
Well
Horse. I have yet to get to Equadorand try cuii.
I've had gator before, just like beef really
Gator tastes NOTHING like beef. Closer to catfish IMHO.
10,02Hey, I'm back
phew
10,02Sorry for worrying you all
Is OK.
10,02Yeah I'm fine >_<
10,02Thanks for asking
good to hear
hey there guys :3
damn
THIS IS AMAZING
Apparently not since he decided to assault us with this!
...Oh dear...
that sucks man
well
it is technically a passing grade correct?
just below average IIRC
10,02D- in their course catalog states 'Barely Passing'
:OOOO <3 this song...kirbopher is a genus
damn it that's not fair
argh
10,02Changing requirements on me left and right
whatever happened to student rights?
not the other way around
raritys flank....should be feard by all ~.~
10,02Plus now our student government is passing a bill ON THEIR OWN BEHALF to be compensated financially for their work.
10,02Real jerk move.
damn it
Dang. ;^;
:O
You're payingthem to be educated. And to make certain you are educated. I mean, I can see how it can be frustrating, but they do have a point.... and standards.
US colleges piss me off
OK. The SGU is going beyond their perview.
wait
10,02Introduction to Materials
and i come back... to zelda ponies... AHHHHH!!!
on one course?
out of how many?
AYAAYAYAYAYAAAY

hey my ringtone!

Been there, suffered though it-- it's not unusual.

Okay. This just got WRONG.
/me now has a nose bleed

worst song EVAH
damn you mesmerizing plot movement!
hi
gives me time to check timblr
oh well
tumblr*
I need a drink anyway
Well, as I said,-- I have TWO baccalaureates. Experience. Some courses are more... critical than others. And they do make the rules...
Yeah
BOOMheadshot
oh, a couple of grand mayhaps?
probably
oh well, that's just another year or two in debt after college
the important thing is PASSING the course.
Actually glad I didn't go to college when it was suggested I should tbh.
There are no guarantees ever of anything. I studied to be a journalist... and sadly, graduated just after the newspapaer market was saturated by a pack of loons.
yeah
well that's why most people go to college
not for the sake of learning
for the improvement of their chances in the job market
cobol and machine language?
I take it you're not familiar with those terms?
Eh, I'm just being cynical about my own situation I should stop.
COBOL: Common Business Oriented Language. Oh- 54 last November.
wat?!
woah
:D!
and here I thought I was one of the older members here.
54? wow... thats like 2 of me
...54?
o___o
8,1who's the oldest here?

8,1what?
lol whippersnappers
8,1seriously?
he's 54
8,1that's awesome!
How often do I have to say it?
alright, I shall pay heed form now on.
damn, I have been surprised by this place yet AGAIN
8,1but yeah, that's awesome
he's 17
he's 14
Daaaaang.
:D idiot hippies
damn man, you live through it!
actually
Scorpio's rule! November 7th for me
10,02BUT
When he said he was goling to do something-- he DID it.
10,02:<
ooooooowww

GOGOGO!
10,02Until I get the cable tomorrow
10,02Won't be able to talk while I do this though
10,02Here we go...

OH!
I read that wrong the first time. Yeah, I elieve you now

I would say
I believe the term is LOL.
/me giggles.

I was in my early teens and the only thing I could think was "Oh, crap."
yeah, that covers it.

Yaaaay

eyah
lolwut?
I only get 2 Mbps tops
wow
8,1bugger, hs'e gone
3.35 Mbps :(
same Saturn
/me nods
he must have been dc'd
8,1i might add COBOL to my learn list after Scala
8,1looking into it, it's actually quite a nice language
wow though, I can't believe that there are fans out there that old
I think that really does say something about the show
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1728986505.png
there, my results
at least my ping is low
10,02????
don't forget every language
you know... my upload speed is horrendous
10,02How was the stream?
choppy
audio out of synch...
10,02Really? :<
8,1i might submit a coursework assignment next semester in COBOL
yeah, not just me for once
my stream keeps on buffering
Yep.
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1728986218.png

/me is now off the roof

Saturn: cobol? thats still in use?

8,1aw :(
stream died here
we got buffer rings
yeah
hmm, maybe more
damn you BUFFERING!!
8,1it pauses a lot to buffer for me, but i think that might be my connection
Saturn: me too, it's on SB's end
8,1ah, okay
10,02Mah face?
Saturn: how I do that?
8,1oh also, tell FME to drop frames if it's struggling
10,02Alright
OH!
8,1aye
/me faceplams
The results were... inconsistent.
10,02But you want to see my face?!
wait wait wait
my stream is buffering
10,02No ;____;
gimmeh a sec D:
59 people, thats a little low

fanservice lives
and dissapear a few secs after
tabitha
shes female
lol
OMFG way to totally stereotype
maybe, since she... or he... sounded a little yellow bus special
She
he just finds it easier to let his gorgeous mane flow free >.>'
she
when she spoke
Pony logic.
plus her head does not look like a hairdryer
is best logic
I'm not disregarding it, I'm referring to the possibility that it could be male. Though... mostly teasingly, because yes, boyponies always have really distinct characteristics.
yeh a headryer
lol
In fact, if you go by the ponies you can buy...there's like two boys for a hundred girls
do eet
hmm?
but few and far males
lol
craze
eeeeeyup
XD
inter-species
dragons age slower than ponies
Not to mention Spike can INSTA-GROW.
That's not mental state
we saw, if anything, his mental state deteriorates
yeh
and more often than not he can be the more adult of them all
but when puberty becomes a bitch for him hes a monster
everytime I see rainbow dash now I get teary eye'd
;_;
maybe dragons turn different according to mental states
IKR
if they dont become greedy
they grow up bipedal and civilized
grow up greedy

I tend to avoid the term 'pegasister' altogether. Despite its origins, as far as I'm concerned 'brony' is genderless.
