Oh goddd
/me holds on to LadyCanary
Lol
Dark_Horst: Yes i do
you think deadspace was scary?
books
tl,dr
If you really want to get scared by it, you must sit down and be immersed by the game
Dead Space is not verry scary
I be scared.
/me makes amnesia noises at ScootaChicken
Dont be scared. and OH GOD ITS DARK
tl;dr
NOPE.
I LOVE the dark.
Scoota !
turn up the gamma
Amnesia is scary because it produces an environment in which you breed your own horror. Dead Space just makes monsters pop out of vents. You're scared for all of two seconds, then you pump it full of lead and it's over.
O.o
Pinkieruler124!
oooh dark rooom ooooh
Darkness is like the sarchia sauce of scary
Who's streaming and how far is he into the game?
outside in october is enough to give me the chills
Nittany_Discord is streaming, about ten minutes.

We've just started the game
So chat and voice reactions at the same time, eh? This should be fun to watch :3333
Hides off to scoota
*ghost noises*

Oh
In that respect, Dead Space is the lowest common demon of horror: the jumpscare.
END MY PAIN ALREADY AND SCARE ME!!!!!
Not wrek, Nittany my bad

Nice, but I have to leave soom

U might need to hide i think..
eneter my secret room
ScootaChicken: What just happened
At least there it's an uncontrolled environment full of enemies and it builds a feeling of helplessness even as you mow down opposition. Dead Space, you're a one man army, why would you be scared of ANYTHING?

If you're scared of Dead Space, like legitimately beyond just the jumpscares, then you're quite frankly weird. I tend to laugh after a good jumpscare, because they aren't that bad. XD
Anyone else up for some left 4 dead? This is kind of borning, No offense Nittany, I just dont like lets play

as scary as amnesia is, watching someone else play it can be EXTREMELY boring
hellooo
Do you eventually have to fight, chase, or at least somewhat interact with something scary? T.T
10,02Scary comes from being in a dark room alone wearing headphones while actualling playing the game.
/me is scared by the noises

SuperBrony64, the only scary game I remember play ever was "Alone in the Dark" for the playstation 1.
playing*
o-o
be more scared if he was all freaking out ingame
therehtherethere
and everywhere
AND THERE
The structure needs more railings
Scary would be if while playing the game an axe murder comes out of the darkness behind you and chases you
i hear skype
And perhaps a few moats
So has anyone seen lagx's reaction vids to this XD?
why do i hear skype
CCCP, kick'em in the nuts.
CCCP: oh that will happen
LOL
wait for it
lol
lagx? I've seen a ton of different ones. I don't remember that one. I have avoided a playthrough
scary is reading a note and the note says im behind you and as you read it you turn around and they are nehind you
i'm gonna get dinner going... i'm starved
Dashie_Dashie: what if the axe murder is a girl?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN-tHB7srSY&feature=related

than punch her in the eye
CCCP, Tazer.

When I do dream it's always nonsense.
^
/me nomz and nomz Meanwhile, TheGreatAndPowerfulT and TOY_PON3 and HatchetRyda and PinkieSpice and especially PinkieSpice
Last dream I had of ponies was with Fluttershy

http://youtu.be/rzxzho63csU

Wet dreams you say?

We're talking. in a very odd manner.
Talking about wet dreams, I think...
13were?
:'(
13so now you aren't?
Roflbot: dat grammar
Or I could have misread something
or are you!
lol
I think ill watch something from my anime collection
HatchetRyda Scary Butt Fun
/me yawns and lays down
oh no ya dont IshCreepiestPony
/me crawls into her corner of shame
I think were just talking about normal dreams MASF123
i aint reading it
yes
/me hands AttackWithHugs a bucket.
/me uses party canon on AttackWithHugs
Ok...I gotcha
hiya Shizuka
/me IshDrunkestPony
AttackWithHugs: Don't be ashamed of reading clopfics really. It's normal in a way
ya you get a good laugh
Meanwhile: Bucket? What for? *puts it on head*
I don't read clop fics. :B
AttackWithHugs: for exactly that.
hay ebryponery
/me hates Clopfics
/me occasionally reads them
I don't like imagining ponies like that
just started to read them
08,01i like romantic fics; if they include some tasteful clop, fine
^
^^
/me hates CaptainAlliance on Youtube
^^^
TOY_PON3: Okay. I guess it's because I care too much about what people thing
08,01and comedy clop is always fun
think*
Clopfics ruins the innocence the show has
AttackWithHugs: You should'nt dear..
/me thinks Clopfics are NOT funny
hai EberyPoner
IngloriousPony89: That's your opnion
AttackWithHugs: Best advice, care not at all for what other people think.
^
thanks you Meanwhile
/me is in a pissed off mood now
08,01Romance Reports is a great fic, but has clop
MASF123: clopfics aren't really 'sposed to be funny. There 'sposed to be steamy.
hehe
And I am back , One box of girl scout cookies later..
/me hugs AttackWithHugs
Meryl Streep picks up Best Actress to the surprise of absolutely nobody.
/me leaves
they are funny
bye MASF123
08,01Jaketehsnake: were they made from real girl scouts?
hai eberyponer
horrified MASF123 is horrified
romance comedy is my favorite type of fic ~
:|
^
He has the right to be offended by clopfiction if he wants
Of course they were, family recipe and all :)
/me is not coming back for a while
I try not to. I'm fun and optimistic and charismatic, but I guess I'm afraid of saying no.
/me hugz everypony
We all have a right to our opnions now everypony
hugs TOY_PON3 and AttackWithHugs
Don't drool on anyone IshDrunkestPoner.
someone takes a bit to heart what other people likes ~
ok why are we talking about clopfics?
/me hugs HatchetRyda back
I return. That was a good nap.
/me drools on Meanwhile
1,3guys, when someone says they're uncomfortable about a topic, that's the time to drop that topic
/me wipes spittle off his shoulder.
okay ~
13in other words
We're going it in a tasteful matter at least RoflBot
13WE NEED AN ADULT
kirzstryfe: You're right.

I'm slightly afraid to click on that link Jaketehsnake
08,01i love comedy fics, grimdark, and plain outright sad, but i'm a real sucker for romance
Damn she left..
lawl
/me hugz AttackWithHugs
I hate outright sad.
It has to do with destroying clopffics Inglorious
same except for the grimdark ~
THE CHAMP IS HERE
Mkay then
<--- is going to read one
I'm a sucker for romance too
Must.. find.. torrent.. of.. "A Goofy Movie"
Hallo thar bronystate (O_O)/"
Why would anyone want to read something sad.
It boggles my mind.
Welcome CHAMP to our little interesting conversation!
I always read sad things
I love adventure, Friendshipping mildgrimdark and some sad but I am usually far to sad to read them.
08,01well, i love horror in general
jumping in already!
/me pulls out the book of love, and sees to his horror that someone added a clop section
OHAI Randall
Meanwhile because you touch yourself at night
OhaI!
AttackWithHugs: Why did you leave?
Pinkiespice XD
Though I guess technically since I'm lot really allowed to read sad things that could contribute.
08,01speaking of awesome fics, have any of you read Stargate: Equestria?
i'll find out why she left
bleh...
/me is taking the brony study
Never seen Stargate.
hi emangamer
Why does molestia exist? - Because you touch yourself at night
*chases after AttackWithHugs*
hey TOY_PON3
IshDrunkestpony BEST. RESPONSE. EVAR
RoflBot: Indeed
Molestia exists so you don't have to touch yourself at night.
=/
hahahaha
^
Molestia? BRING IT ON.
at least celestia will protect me... oh wait
08,01Meanwhile: the sad fics are often the best written ones
/me preps to crack some heads
I'd Mount that
Jaketehsnake :)
08,01good sadfic is hard to pull off
indeed
/me backs away from kirzstryfe
08,01Jaketehsnake: that's. mah. line.
a bit too much and it's too cheesy
/me backs toward TOY_PON3
Ever read My Little Dashie Meanwhile?
too little and is not good
I always read depressing sad fics, even though I probably shoudlen't
IngloriousPony89: I did. It was boring.
My Little Dashie is boring, a bit sad but boring
MLD is not that good i
/me <--- champ is a sappy depressed fellow :P
08,01i'm gonna go eat a muffin

Meanwhile: stop taht
later ponies

08,01Jaketehsnake: it was complicated. there was RAM, but 640kb of this was conventional memory, for loading in executable code

otakon: tired, couldn't help it.

08,01the rest, up to the 1MB mark was the UMB, or upper memory block

TOY_PON32: its pokemon red with a bunch of new stuff
MahBoi777: It won't happen again
emangamer: Really?
:D
Here's a question. I know the brony community loves to mix ponies into all their other favorite media ("it's now 20% cooler!"), and for most stuff it is indeed improved. but are there any notable examples that don't really seem to work as well when ponies are added?... For example, the movie "Seabiscuit" becomes really surreal if it's about the lives of 3 pony stallions affected by a championship racing human. :/

You're proper professional at drawing, Wrek...

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Probably going to do the same
09,01how did you know my weak point?!?
Bullets?
pfft

JustaninnocentPony: and I own one
09,01I found my Spellcaster deck a few days ago
i was trying to get one of those rare cards... and when i quit trying to get it.. seconds later someone gets the card from the machine
09,01but I haven't checked the Forbidden/Limited list so yeah
JustaninnocentPony: actually, I own a foiled Rainbow Dash token and it is SEXY
09,01Haven't played in a few years
I gave my yugioh deck away to my friend who moved across country from me.
:)
09,01maybe if we used webcams, we could play?
lol
09,01x3
KINDNESS AND GENEROSITY BITCHES :3
NewDCD: you need to play Magic
I haven't played Yu-Gi-Oh in forevur
its so much better
09,01I would play Magic
MtG is SO Much better and more fair than YGO
09,01but when I was going to buy a deck
09,01something happened
09,01I don't remember
Po-Ni-Oh
is better
09,01and then the two game shops in this country (which were a walking distance for me)
09,01went bankrupt
09,01so DERP
oh i agree
13magic... i am so bad at magic..
NewDCD: I can help you get into it. It really is a REALLY emmersive game
I stumbled across a wallpaper not long ago of Trixie and Twilight playing Magic and couldn't stop laughing :P
Shizuka: we still need to play
09,01I used to play Duel Masters, which is Magic Lite though
09,01and by Play I mean
09,01"I bought a starter deck, got my ass kicked"
13no really i'm like terrible...
Lol.
09,01oh and I have a Vega deck in UPS I've never used
c'mon shizu I can teach you
13way way way way too many cards for me to stand a chance
just put rainbow dash on a card
instant win
09,01Shizuka I'm terrible at card games too, don't worry about it
1,3almost every TCG is Magic Lite
^

ahmen kirzstryfe
XD
Magic is magic
/me realisess it's 5:30am already and gets up, dreading the thought of sleeping in school.
i tried to play magic the gathering with some 6 graders once
i won
lol
kirzstryfe: have you played MTG?
Brb.
NOW GIVE ME UR LUNCH MONIEZ KIDDIES, lol
Pokemon is a "waiting for energy" simulator
in the TCG
i'm 6 feet tall
1,3yeah, played in tournaments a few years back, it's been almost a year since I last played though
im tall and big enpugh to be a bully lol
but im not
13i should take a picture of the card set i've inherited from dad..
good
kirzstryfe: does the name Ravnika mean anything to you?
13probably a good two or three thousand cards there..
Shizuka: please do, I would love to see it
bullies are bad
o.o
in fact ive been in some fights before
standing up for littler kids
1,3that set came out right after I stopped playing the first time
So what are we talking about now?
i kicked one guys ass for picking on my 6 grade friend
I have a couple thousand next to me
13i think the latest set in dad's collection is ice age
I probably have a solid thousand lands
yu-gi-oh
Dang
TOY_PON32: kicking peoples asses for no raisin, lol
Okay..
Shizuka: hmm....there might actually be some real value in there then.
No raisin
13oh most likely
Ok
It would be halirious if he had a dark depths...that card is so badass
Lol
13me i just keep it around cause it's a good solid base to put my laptop on when i retreat upstairs
Shizuka: I want you to guess how much a beta black lotus is running for
/me is now at his desk and tired as hell.
1,3I have a friend with some unopened alpha boosters
/me used to like Yu-GI-Oh
same
13was like over $40 iirc
kirzstryfe: you lucky bastard
I actually owned a black lotus card for several years, but I had to sell it when times got a little tight.
sucks :<
13considering black lotus is like the most banned card ever, or was that nox lotus..
13the one that lets you win in one turn
I still got the cards, lol, hopr they haven't turned to dust
I have Exodia all the pieces first edition holo
kirzstryfe: PLEASE get a hold of one of these alpha boosters for me
Bought them for 80 bucks
i should write a fanfic about yu-gi-oh
INSTANT WIN
for the hell of it
Shizuka: umm... black louts is "tap sacfifice: add three mana of any color to your mana pool"
but yugioh with ponies
Random
http://magiccards.info/uh/en/124.html
I liek randomness
1,3with the right card pull, legacy decks can 1-turn the game
hey Shizuka http://www.dacardworld.com/gaming/mtg-unhinged-single-mox-lotus-foil?utm_source=google&utm_medium=base&utm_campaign=Google_Base
GrimGallop: mox louts is halirious

It may be the tiredness, but I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
PLUTONIUM IN RACECARS
kirzstryfe: dat dark depths combo...I personally hate legacy
...lets you add infinite mana?
thats not broken at all
lol
Infinate Mamas?
kirzstryfe: tarmagoyphs are way to expensive for me to play
Ingwaz: its from unhinged set...its not a real card
dRAKE
DRAKE
well...it IS real
but you cant play it in anything
Okay let me know when Duel Monsters talk is over
Ping me

still, bit ridiculous
hehe
and they were really fucking halirious
like rally funny
There's a card that costs something like 1.5 million to play and is basically an auto-win.
TOY_PON32 *troll face*
there is one card
its like
CARD GAMES ON JET FIGHTERS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8JCX9E0bEI&feature=related the reactions for the new MLP episodes
our market research shows that players like cards with really big names so we are giving this card the largest name ever elemental
and yes that is one card
all that is its name
13love that one
13can't remember if we have it or not
13i know we have a few unhinged's
13like smart ass
1,3my card <3
smart ass is halrious
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2bXjobnP5c
fat ass is actually really overpowered
I have a full set of OMRSTPLRLCNSWMTCTHTALCNEEs :D
Shizuka: you know what card is broken?
13isn't there one that's like an inf/inf creature?
/me realise he has History with Britain's most boring man and will probably sleep and get murdered by him.
Shizuka: yes BFM
lol
generation 3...
the card is called BFM
lol
big furry monster
13that was it, and like 99 to cast
well i watch generation 1... i deserve a medal
13might be a different one i'm thinking of for that though
Shizuka: lemmie find it
http://magiccards.info/uh/en/121.html
Shizuka: it was actually 2 cards
BFM is 15 black and is 99/99
you needed them both in hand

/me hugs back
04How are you?
Shizuka: we seriously need to have a conversation about the cards you have
tired
13don't know what i have though
13that's my problem with TCGs... way way way way way way too many cards to keep track of
/me heard 3.5, pressed ctrl+w
Still talking about cards?
/me leaves
yup
I used to have a red Dwarven Warrior/Shocker combo deck that was pretty spiffy.
Shizuka: it really goes into teh deep recesses of your brain
lol
I couldnt tell you any of the cards in alara block
oh god, the animation in that is HORRID
13yeah but i prefer those recesses to be filled with ponies
poleman cards ftw
but you gimmie some flavor text or art

i did something very random
and i survived!
i made a chair dance without me dancing in hit

but im sitting in the chair

Shizuka: but yea...one day we need to have a more indepth conversation about the cards you have
and kirzstryfe I would like to hear more about these alpha packs
le TV: coming soon! Pokemanz gold and silver!
you have sparked my interest with that
04o_o
le me: FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
04I understood nothing
it was nice, because the dwarven warriors could make another creature with power 2 or less unblockable for a turn, and the Shockers were 1/1 creatures that whenever they dealt damage to an opponent, that opponent had to discard all cards in their hand and draw that many cards from their deck.
thats the thing XD
Pale_Horse: sounds overpowered
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6LN4lWcABQ&feature=related
i say things that are completely ununderstandable
you know what card was actually kinda OP
and yay new word :p
goblin siege-gang

dat lol
siege-gang commander was really good
anyways
tomorrow is a big day for me

/me would rather go to Australia lol
c'mon shizu...you need to sleep too
I take it card talk is over
TOY_PON32: well idk
I think preordain is so much better than ponder
and glitaxian probe is just horrible
04That would be wicked NS
that card is just pure crap
04We all crash at Altair's
IDK why everyone plays it
04you have your first joint
I can see the appeal, but it's just not my style
04and I just sit back staring at you guys thinking "What is up with all these guys"
even thought I do like to play U/B controll
03You'd all crash at my house :<
emangamer: It's just the fact that I haven't played Yu-GI-Oh in like forever so I get lost in convo
now U/B controll vs U/B controll
THAT is a really fun match up
very intelectually challenging
lmfao
and yes
then we'd crash Sneas' place
and sit on the server
"oops"

basically
hey, if the streaming is on.. let's watch G3 MLP!
03I used to be bullied in middle school
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEE
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hahaha
So, new Derpy. Yay or Neigh?
if they say something like "fucking nigger"
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I wonder how quickly this video would accumulate views if I set it to public instead of unlisted...
neigh
Pinkies4thWall: I don't care
03Not so much in high school though, I was just a loner then :3
I say YEIGH
what if i told you i know many secrets?
Nope
Aw, shucks. darn ad got me all excited.
hmmmmm, what kind of secrets?
Say something like "Oh, you called me a nigger? I fail to see how I'm a 'nigger'. I was under the impression that the typical meaning of 'nigger' means 'black person'. As you can see, that is not so. Please rephrase your stupidity into something more logical. Thank you for playing the game."
still no feed?
YOU RUINED IT BOI
that's just an example
but yeah
SHY
I like the new Derpy voice.
just turn their words against them
lmao
use big words
i don't. not really
XD
if it was more slurred yeah i would
MahBoi777: Something's are best left unknown
I like it
curse you boi, you've foiled my plans
not that i didn't like the old one, i miss that one
i like the lisp thing. It was adorable
/me 11,01hugs Shy
the new voice was half assed
If only they kept her new voice, kept the eyes, and the name. It would've been all good.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=Aih_-483uVk
But I'm not complaining anymore
Well, just don't hate. they could've eliminated her from the rest of the show
^
yah, I was a little sad when RD didn't say Derpy, but oh well I guess
I still love Hasbro
03If I was bullied now I'd break their faces :3
indeed
Wait.
/me hides lolviolence
MahBoi777: same here
They edited RD's voicing too?
And Studio B is still awesome
Yeah
eeeeeyup
MGM
Mhm
Damn auto correct
She don't say "Derpy"
?
No
did i ever tell you that one of our teachers got kicked in the head a few years ago by a student .-.
nope
it's awful, just awful
It was heartbreaking
"Be careful, you don't want to do more damage then you've you've alrready done."
might as well have never voiced derpy to begin with.
it was like 3 or 4 years ago it suppoedly happned
I almost cried.
egad, what did I do now? lol
the teacher commited suicide in 2009
:S
Pinkies4thWall: In a way you're right
link to this new footage.
now, plz
03wow .-.

/me doesn't want to see the video anymore :(
at least we all know it was in the episode, all that matters
can we get some mythbusters
yyeah ._.
._.
stream yet?
the vid is too sad...
/me exited the tab before derpy appeared
and then last year a senior commited suicide for unknown reasons
._.
It would be a miracle if they call Derpy her name again
TT_TT
infact it was only 1 year and 5 days ago it happened
Seriously a miracle
Stubio B now has -75% respect
No don't blame them
it was a top student as well
Blame the soccer moms
LOL
no
Blame Yamino
be serioous
I'm being serious
I'M SERIOUSLY SERIOUS
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/look-into-derpy-from-kreoss.html?m=1
Tbh we were lucky to have her talk in the first place...
Studio B has done so much why you hate them over some stupid issue?
BritishBrony: tru dat
Just because Derpy was changed doesn't mean we have to get angry and revolt
i'm not angry revolting
Hell we're better than that
I'm not angry at all
i'm revolting because it's insulting to me
/me throws away torch and pitchfork
Exactly. SHe still gets a part on that episode- they didn't comepletely cut it off. It could be worse.
Just let it go man
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R66X8M-Buak&feature=g-upl&context=G25f6553AUAAAAAAAAAA and here's why.
i'm just sad, not crying..
i mean not mad..
I made this post on reddit hopefully it helps out
:$
Let it go...please my fellow bronies
http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/q7s15/lets_end_the_sadness_and_be_optimistic/
i'm incapable of crying over a scene like this
Pinkies4thWall: it is not studio b's fault
Bluestrom_S: Indeed
TOY_PON32 we the community we ned to say that we arent mad but we arrent happy with what happend to her
Ingwaz: I was trying to explain that
TOY_PON32: you did not do so concisely enough
or i suspect you did not since you were apparently still trying
bananas
RainbowJack: I know that. I'm not happy but I won't get angry
it isn't their fault at all. but they could've at least changed it to something less half assed
Ingwaz: Studio B has done enough we can't expect more from them
Ingwaz: but it IS sombody's fault. I'm one who will love/ tolerate, but I need to talk with whoever is the one that, if quiet, this never would have happened
Just let it go...
05you know i love every single one of you right?
Derpy will be around forever she's no dead
put a banana in ur ear, yes put a ripe banana right into your favorite ear, lol
05right?
it is as many have said before me, there are many factors that could have caused this to happen. Several possibilities that leave it out of Hasbro's hands. Right now it is important that we wait patiently and calmly and remember our motto of love and tolerate, we need to wait for official word from hasbro
03nini :<
Wrek: i find that to be highly unlikely
/me huggles Wrek
What's everypony saddlesore about now?
Wrek: I love you too
seems illogical
/me hugs Wrek
Derpy
LOL
Dismo: its best to simply not ask about it
nini :(
we can't just sit here and do nothing or we'll all just fall through the floor
Dismo: nuthin, we were discussing bananas
>w> ..... Okay then.... I'm watching you.
Hasbro failed to inform us this was happening. Thats what they messed up with
that's another thing derpy taught in that scene
:$
Silver_Streak: we are not saying you should do nothing, instead, write to hasbro in a clear and concise way explaining why you feel this is wrong. be sure to remain respectful, but assert your view on it as well
that's a derpy in the display!
^
:3
:I People are bitching about the writers or something? Why? Either don't watch it or be thankfull it's not canclled?
So we spam hasbro with polite emails?
Pinkies4thWall: her hair seems a bit too long, it might be daisy
Oh
And RD looks pale
Pinkies4thWall: spam no, send emails once containing your views and why you feel this is wrong
Look no matter what happens in the future we will always love Derpy Hooves
I definately remain respectful. remember i'm a lady. I can fight in ways men can't. i will be professional about it. I am being professional. See my youtube vid i posted? That just the start.
Spam: the community, one per i meant
TOY_PON32: we all know that, that much is obvious, the problem is what may happen in the future considering the precident this could set
There is a petition to change the scene back... http://www.change.org/petitions/hasbro-studiosthe-hub-return-derpys-scene-in-the-last-roundup-to-normal#
I want to say Silver_Steak, but it's Silver_Streak.....I liek steak
Silver_Streak: men are just as capable in fighting using methods rather than brawn if they choose to do so
yeah.
Ingwaz: Thats what I'm afraid of..
SHY?
i signed one earlier
Let's poke at it some more, I'm sure hasbro wont bucket the show in spite of us.
I just dont want Bronies to fall apart because of this
but i'm afraid of brony ragers who flame hasbro
don't think i don't know that Ingwaz. I do know that. Just some get way angry fast is all. i didn't say all
signing the petitions only does so much, due to the massive amount of emails that was sent out to hasbro's email boxes, they had to block them, you are better off sending the emails personally
that'll fuck it up for us
Why don't we just accept it.
^
YES WHY
Accept it and go on
"Wont bucket the show" -Most ofthe veiwers and income from toys/Clothing/Soon to be DVD's Are/Will be from us.
Silver_Streak: indeedsome do, but i have met many a woman who was quicker to anger than i
:|
Accept, but push for change and hope that works
lol see that can be true on both ends
STEAK
Pinkies4thWall: Indeed
I didnt know Silver_Streak was a woman btw lol
Accept and move on is a move of defeat
Lol i am. I am a woman
O_o.....oops
:3
o-o
and here is me. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R66X8M-Buak&feature=g-upl&context=G25f6553AUAAAAAAAAAA
hey i thought everyone here was a man lol
05you dont type like a woman
05>:C
:D
LOL
What i do type like a woman
Silver_Streak is a girl?
@All: we must stay true to the motto Love and Tollerate sure we might have been saddent about the events that happend but please i think it will be alright
Yes i am watch the vid and see for yourself
how does one type like a woman?
Indeed RainbowJack
I use caps
most of the time
Pegasister, while gender-specific, i believe is not a justifiable term
silver...we see nothing, theres a picture of someone in a fursuit in the background, and a disembodied voice
LIKE THIS??
MahBoi777: You should know :D
Just kidding
and complete scentances most of the time
lol
love it
05anyways
TOY_PON32: OH U
.-. What's going on? Why is everypony bitching? No season 3? No movie? Are they doing something to it.
But my spelling can still fail :P
Yes Wrek?
the MLP fandom is in its lowest condition because of this event, fuel on friendship is low today
I need the info
Man, woman, boy, or girl, we're all bronies
05i dont give a fuck, hi Silver_Streak, your sex is unimportant here. gl hf!
Haha your waering 3D glasses!!!
-.- dismo, read equestriadaily's posts for the past few days
Haha
Who's wearing glasses?
Hey everyone.
we'd rather not have it brought up once again and have to go through the entire process of explaining everything all over again
hi Placebo
In the video
Placebo: <3
I'm going to completely misinterpret that and accuse Wrek of sexism.
it's like the computer is moving towards me @_@
08,01guess who failed at going to bed
08,01again!
TOY_PON32: <3
ME
Pegasister is now less easily recognizable as a term than "brony"
Damn Hub! I'm not willing to get up a 7:00 A.M. Just to watch a cartoon. Also, I have cox, and require a FUCKING cable box. <_<
and i wear glasses
05which is why you will never be respected in my eyes GrimGallop
08,01brony is a unisex term
I'm a pagasister!
I'm a cox
05sexism is sooo 1990's
All this time I thought Silver_Streak was a guy. Haha :D
08,01can i be a pegasister?
08,01i wanna be one
no
eez genderless?
Silver Streak is a pagasus
Placebo: Sorry about last night ._. It wont happen again
lol wrek
And you'll never be respected in my eyes, Mr. Women-Aren't-Important :P
pag
Wrek, it's about being offended by miniscule terms now.
08,01Ingwaz: f[yay]k you, i'm now a pegasister
sooo 2012
TOY_PON32: wub wub wub
hey I'm a sea brony! :p
FINALLY A SEA PONY
05miniscule? that offends me
fyaik
no you're not, your application to be considered a pegasister was rejected
Im a muffin
I prefer the the unisexual term Brony over pegasister.. But whatever.
05stay PC!

/me snuggles Silver_Streak
^
c y'all
08,01Pinkies4thWall: i'm already learnèd, does that count?
I call everypony a Brony
Pinkies4thWall: i have someone i know who calls herself a pegasister rather than a brony, simply her choice
I liek ponies :3
aww i get two snuggles
/me learns that brony

sooo
i got a question
who cares its 5:20....MUST SING-A-LONG
;):):D
why those the stream lag on my laptop
00,10it will be great for him to make it so I can never play it cause I detest yelling =p
:)
this song allways makes me smile
lack of processing power?
This song is oddly adorable.
This song needs a sing-a-long version
why is there no smile for pinkie :(
/me cries manly tears and dont know why
or overburdened hard disk of ponies
She said "if you are sad or blue"
does that make her racist?
00,10it needs a CC version so i can turn on the transcribe audio
or being blue
blue isn't racist, have you ever listened to jazz? :P
is like being black or yellow? (NO RACISISM INTENDED HERE)
why do people thing that a full hard disk slows your pc? its somewhat true on windows but theres no reason for it
this was a surprisingly good song
there goes the 4th wall
Gravity Cat Is Amused

That's strangely scary.
it'd be interesting
Kammerjunk: Teenies :p
I see what you did there.
not g2 teens, they were silly
bad silly

You know what we should see? G3.5 ponies in G4.
Pinkie is awesome

Well, duh.
indeed Thunderpony
O.O
^sumica
Kammerjunk: but we already defeated Q
Call upon the seaponies, simply send an SOS!
yay~
Seaponies...in G4?! Well, they could b good i guess.
maybe pinkie pie is the only thing that makes sense and everything else is chaotic
CUTE FACES EVERYWHERE
cinema scope
00,10Is that like that comic where pinkie is auatistic?
Pinkie Pie is best crazy!
My headcanon (Which I'm pretty scared of for various reasons) is that Celestia ordered the extinction of the seaponies because they were freaks of nature.
00,10and the whole frieds thing is all in her head.
pinkie takes reality, zips it up, dugs a hole, throws it into a hole builds a house on top of the hold and moves into the house on top of the hole she dug
....you should see someone about that Kammerjunk
I should.
mhmm
sorta
happy pinkie generates happy
^
except pinkie is even more of a diety
Pinkie always brings a smile, for some reason.
Whoever is streaming should play that 'Save Derpy' video. Time for sadness.
Reading rainbow
Oh my childhood
Damsus: Life is a game and Pinkie has cheat codes enabled
pinkie is a happy, where ever she goes she leaves happy
Hahaha

They have chairs...
You know, no matter what I try, I can't stop looking at the stream once I looked at it.
Chairs can only be used to sit like humans...
It doesn't matter what's being streamed, either.
So theye all sit like lyra!
Thunderpony: They leave some out for Lyra.
If you have not seen this-- you will be happy you did.

POnies helped me a lot when I broke my hip.
I don't really want to go into detail about what ponies did for me, because I could be here all day.
i woulndn't go as far as a reason to live but a reason to enjoy and appreciate life and be happy
it is a reason to live but i wouldnt say the only one
Obviously not.

0,5Hiya
00,10and then it go loud
Just
I included ponies in my last presentation, without ever explaining why.
Just think about it for a while
You were saying, Sunica?
BronyinJapan: what are you trying to persuade people to do, become bronies? at least give FiM a chance? To stop haters hating?
And my last essay even took play in Equestria.
Sadly, my teachers are not bronies.
lol
took place*
KwakLad all of what you just said
I just did it because I could.
Oh okay then BronyinJapan ill give it a think
Spike Jones Ponified. Nothing could be better!
RawketLawnchair I was thinking and........imma go and do it:P
Well, it could be Cole Porter.
That'd be great.
BronyinJapan: I still implore you to reconsider.
:D
Well it's early in the morning, I should get to bed.
remember, less than 1% of brony community is asian, it's so rare to find brony here...

Yeah, I told my parents I didn't want to do that.
00,10oki too much, soft music.

LordCelestia: confirmed?
Since my father is a very strong supporter of Darwinism, bless him, he was happy with that.
0,5catholic thing
but my family is like 5 dif. religions
Phase4: You know how you're baptised?

It's basically that, except you agree yourself.

Thunderpony: Well, duh.
Well, time for me to return to work, goodbye everypony.
No wonder the colts don't seem to be bothered by anything
00,10you all like this song right?
I'm ok with it
LordCelestia: 22.5
Equestria is a female-dominated society.
I'm ok with it
0,590/4 = 45/2 = 22.5/1
0,5oops
Stallions are supressed.
0,5damn it
0,5= 90/4 = 45/2 = 22.5/1
o.o
0/4=0
see? ponies + communisim lead to math
/0!!!!!!
most stallions work as royal guard
On the other hoof, EVERYCOLT is almost guarnteed to havd a date at the prom?
wait, what?
Sumica: nopony divided by 0
GO DISCORD

00,10I kinda like this pmv.
Whats happneing im getting disconnected from the sever twice
or just pmv?
Phase4-- MY GOD. You actually came up with a working solution!
0 is an imaginary number, anyway.
dividing by 0 is valid if you define that your allowed domain inclused infinity
00,10but I am looking right at it.
BronyinJapan2: dont know but if your nick is registered you can use /ns ghost nickname password

0,5Isn't Pi infinite?
x^4-2x^2-3=0 I shortened it by making x^2 = t so it became t^2-2t-3=0 and then did t=2/2 +-sqrt (-2/2)^2+3) but this gives me wrong answer. :/

08,01ofna01: i totally would if i could, but i can't, so i won't
I would stream if they would let me, you could all see me do some math. :D
yeah,no,snuff
Haha
08,01Snuffsis: i'd watch that.
i'm confused in this question...
How many hours (on the average) do you spend per week on MLP related activities (watching MLP, interacting with other Bronies, viewing MLP artwork or meme threads, etc.)?
http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/27300000/Ponypuffs-Rainbow-Dash-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-27386008-900-1029.jpg
08,01valoreins: yeah, that implies there are times when i don't
FOVVERER
japan!
:D
IT would be easier to answer it if it was "How many hours per week do you NOT spend on MLP relatied activies"
valoreins: Well, it always on in the background at home.
08,01ofna01: do you accept commissions?
what?
what commissions?
I'll admit, I have almost no MLP music on my ipod
08,01ofna01: can i pay you to draw stuff?
i dont do requests,when ever i try,it doesnt work out right
which is sorta sad

lol
08,01so this guy in the lab just showed us all a bird he taxidermied
But if I haven't seen it for example, because I wasn't online while the link was posted, would that make a relink more justified?
yes jim
then its perfectly fine
Was it chuck testa?
Nope
its a different link,i swear!
d'aaaaawwww
^_^
and i drew that
*RD face* So awesome
YES i solved a math problem like a BAWS!!
page 3/14 of the survey has me stumped.
Bow down before your math overlord!
math needs to be about 20% cooler
: |
"How many hours (on the average) do you spend per week on MLP related activities"
>how many hours
What if it's all the time?
Should be days
im off to school now see y'all later
dammit ofna, stop it, you're making my heart melt
also, hi
Silly question, really. 7 days a week.
ohai CountDoofus
I could write a math problem that is 20% cooler, but it wouldn't work with irc format. :(
lolol http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b_rA4y8BS1A/Tuuqv-VbWUI/AAAAAAAAYKU/GkO4jJAEHJg/s1600/98948+-+artist+wolfjedisamuel+comic+derpy_hooves+fluttershy+luna+twilight_sparkle.jpg
What a shame.
i spend 8 days a week on mlp
how is that for an answer?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEnWvHrfgYE
Snuffsis: Sounds reasonable.

I'm on 10% battery, but ill never let you guys down.

Rango won best animated movie. the Oscars rock again.

The oscars need to be about 20% cooler

:'(
Fluttershy the Fish died. :(
imagine a MLP movie... just 1 envelope, and the card inside says "And ALL the Oscars go to My Little Pony."
:'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
noone wants to hug me for my loss?

Just like MLD
The guy just... Walks.
i walked over 3 miles
Now ofna01, hope for a pet RD
before i decided to come home
so did Forrest Gump, except he ran
Mama always told me life is like a box of chocolates
I lost my dog once, too.
CountDoofus: Walk, forrest walk!
I don't like chocolates
She was very old, and cancer got her.
I know that feel, ofna01.
Run, florist, run! (name that movie?)

Posture, Luigi!
funny TF2 vid
my god
i just relised something
We should totally watch a 3½ hour film on Friday.
Ponies are awesome?
Jim whats new?
I'm picking a super-long move for A.
pootis
I don't know any long B movies.
all three Lord of the Rings movies in a row?
Meet the Spatans
08,01good god
Phase: I didn't understand any of that :D
08,01why can't any of you use "your" and "you're" correctly?
lol
because we are internet folk
Why not watch "The Deluge" It's a 315minute long movie about Sweden invading Poland. :D
wtf
08,01"your" - denotes posession
08,01"you're" - a contraction of "you are"
^
08,01seriously guys, learn grammar
I'm picking Fiddler on the Roof for A.
/me has been trying to improve his use of contractions
The want the difference between Its and It's?
Don't forget Its'
this is the internet there is no such thing as goog grammar
very important
never mind my last, just found it
CountDoofus: imagine being able to save the state of your computer, like with hibernate, and recalling it later
Tovler good choice man
Tovler lolol
inb4 intro reminds me of Inglorious Basterds
Haha.
08,01"it's" = "it is", or posessive of "it"
08,01nothing else
08,01wait, no, that's wrong
08,01"its" is possessive
/me 08,01is confused now
So it's, "Where's its head" not "Where's it's head"?
haha
08,01f[yay]k grammar. i'm gonna go eat some ponies and watch some burgers
Where is it is head?
don't think so
08,01Tovler: aye
Can you differentiate between Sisters, Sister's and Sisters' ? :P
And "a unicorn's magic matches the color its eyes."
Sisters = plural of sister
Sister's = something your sister possess
Tovler
i didnt know that
HOLY SNAP! MLP figurines in the local McDonalds Happy Meals! junkfood for a week, I'm-a-coming!
Awesome CountDoofus
Jm sister's = Sister is. :P
derp
Sisters' would be something she owns.
Been 5 years since I had English in school
CountDoofus: Not in Denmark.
feelsbadman.jpg
No McDonalds over here so I know that feel
That is wrong actually, that is the plural, if you have several sisters and they own something together, it's your sisters' stuff. :P
Wow, really?
No McDonalds at all?
meh... upon closer inspection, I'm not so thrilled anymore
McDonalds suck!
CountDoofus: Do they look like horseapples?
"sucks".
Where i live in Sweden we have mAx, cloests McDonalds is in the next town. :P
Well, there's 600 kilometers to the nearest McDonalds
Yeah, the 's' does not make it plural.
finished filling the bronystudy :D
Jim: Ah. You live in the country?
or would it be "Unicorns' magic matches the color of their eyes?"
valoreins: I'm still going at it.
I live in a city of 50'000 inhabitants
i'm a bit confused with some question though...
Ah.
Tovler, if you are talking about plural, then yes.
http://mcdonalds.be/nl/index_NL.php?page=kids all in dutch, but if you click on "klik hier voor meer info" (in green), you'll see what I mean
" A Unicorns magic matches..." and "Those Unicorns' magic matches...."
*sniff* that was good japan
CountDoofus: Do want
I only want the McDonalds toys for their show-accurate Fluttershy
the video?
yeah
CountDoofus: MFW I understood that word by word.
I don't even speak Dutch.
lawl, pokemon + pony
but they got the cutie marks all wrong :(
gad you liked it
just give the cutie mark crusaders their marks already!!!
anyone streaming?
k, i gota reboot. brb
CountDoofus: Yeah, I raged a bit at the Cutie Marks.
Buyt what would their purpose on the show be then?
yes plz do it now:[
I love that Pinkie Pie they've got CountDoofus
A direct sequel to Pokemon Black/White? due
Also, their muzzles looks kind of weird.
"Typically how many hours do you spend each week on the internet (include all internet activities)?"
Is "all the time" a number?
oh well. bought this today, and I'm happy nonetheless. http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/File:Pony_School_Pals_playset_with_Cheerilee,_Apple_Bloom,_Scootaloo_and_Sweetie_Belle.jpg
to much to count and care
broken link is broken. one sec
CountDoofus: Works for me.
And that's neat-o.
oh
I'll try and be more mindful of my internet activities so I know how long I'm doing stuff here.
btw how long i've been here?
!ping
With MLP, at least I could round up the hours I'm not at school.
Damnit
my pc didnt hibernate
I'm on the Internet even at school.
: |
Phase!

/me remembers how McDonalds toys have told us that the teacher pony's name is Cheerilee.
trying to run swapless and hibernate at the same time aparently doesnt work
/me puts on the Hearts and Hooves Day song

"How often do you spend time online when you'd rather sleep?" Yeah, thanks for that, BronyState.
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I like how that video has more view than the original
Kammerjunk is that a question on the survey posted earlier?
Kwaklad1: It is.
XD
agree'd jim
ok, this time hibernate should work
Lol I got to page 4 before I had to leave
I'm just over halfway through.

How so Tovler? Different colour glow?

Excuse me while I clean my ceiling from bits of exploded brain
Awesome
Now, to see if Pumpkin Cake's magic doesn't match her eyes.
I could have told you that.

I wonder how Deadmau5 can see anything through that mask of his
:O
/me DOWNLOADS NOW
lowercase D; deadmau5
(ah, it's fun to snipe)
08,01Snuffsis: well, you're quading, so you're squaring twice, yes?
snipins a good job,mate!
Tovler: Deadmau5's official site says "Deadmau5".
...Once.
I'm really confused, actually.
08,01so it's (13 sqrt(x)) * (13 sqrt(x)) * (13 sqrt(x)) * (13 sqrt(x))
No, i'm only squaring once. I guess it's my fault for directly translating fro mswedish to english. xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3LPmA5tk2U&feature=related
08,01so that's then: (13 ^ 2 sqrt^2(x)) * (13 ^ 2 sqrt^2(x))
ofna01 have you seen the extented intro?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxzUmD-BjBA
WHAT
08,01and those sqrts are cancelled out
gtg guys :D
cya
Here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4By8YHOnILo
cya valoreins
Bye valoriens
08,01so: (13 ^ 2 . x) * (13 ^ 2 . x)
08,01following the rule of multiplying indices, this becomes: 13 ^ 4 . x ^ 2
the whole thing is 13sqrtx=x+36 so i was then going to square it, so it becomes 13^2x=(x+36)^2. But not sure if it's 13^2x or 13x^2. :P
loving it so far brony
I'm only now looking at the new Korra trailer.
Dont you use your fancy mathmentics
08,01Snuffsis: if you square it, it becomes 13 ^ 2 x
Okay, great. :P
08,01but you asked for quadding, so i did it agin :P
damnit linux! y u no hibernate
WOOHOO!
08,01Phase4: broken kernel?
Yea, well it's called "Kvadrering" in swedish, which, when directly translated becomes quadrating or something like that.
THAT WAS AWESOME
kernels fine
cuz you dont have the right power settings
it just wont hibernate
make sure your bios is set for s4
08,01ah, okay
Phase4 has no food to store for the winter
hibernates in windows so i assume bios is ok
lawl BronyinJapan
did you change hardware since you installed linux?
08,01but yeah, squaring both sides of that gives (13^2)x = x^2 + 36^2
08,01you can then rearrange that and solve for x by factorising
08,01Phase4: aye, that's almost certianly it
when season 2 is over, I plan to download every song from both seasons, burn them on a cd, and have the best back-and-forth trips to work EVER
Awesome!
Yea, i've gotten ti to be, so far, x^2 + 71x + 1127, now going drag out x from there with the PQ formula. :P
WHY DID THEY CHANGE DERPYS EYES AND VOICE
/me pulls out shotgun and cocks it

GOD DAMNIT
your making me fucking cry
lol
dead island music always makes me tear up
Fuck ,this assignment is fucking me over... whatever i do i get the wrong numbers. <.<
my throat is clogging up... excuse me, I need a moment...

more derpy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obdLhRTfDFo&feature=related

whats up guys
the one in Save Derpy
ah
this eman
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
cant

:(
It's that Derpy's appology video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWG0KLSJi8g&feature=related
I love that video Twi_Fi
I still havent seen ANYTHING
to prove that derpy is gone
sorry eman
they edited her name out of last roundup
as far as Im concerned
its all speculatio
they got rid of dash calling her derpy
and?
they un-derped her eyes
that doesnt make her dead
changed her voic
Well, the derpy we've come to love is gone, and thats what matters.
what he said
she could still be in future episodes
NO SHES NOT
well, she officially demoted to background character.
if they get rid of her like that,she's not coming back
Snuffsis: that is not true and by going around saying that you are only stressing other people
NO SHES NOT
any proof?
we have yet to receive any official word on it, and studio b has said that in future episodes, she will be fine
you do realize that derpy was origionally NOT derpy
we have plenty of proof supporting she's gone
In my opinion, even if they make her not canon, she's still Derpy for us
ofna01, like what
really? you have one video thats been changed, which could have been caused by various reasons
what else you got?
I think Derpy didn't need to be canon in the first place.
basically,their flipping a finger at bronies
you cant say thr
that
even if they had to change her, it is not hasbro's fault
people are overreacting
Ingwaz: lol It's butthurt soccer moms' faults.
they knew we loved Depy,got rid of her,just like that
its the people who complained about its fault
Ingwaz, thankyou i couldnt agree more
Ingwaz: Well, i can say that simply because the derpy i love is the one they actually called derpy and that had that silly, but perfect voice and messed up rainbow dashs work.
ofna01, your overreacting
Next you'll be saying "Death to butthurt soccer moms!"
ohai emangamer and Ingwaz and xcanox
i gotta go
later emangamer
yo Phase4
byr Phase4
alright eman
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
cya emangamer
i dare you to watch through that without tearing up
I'm just upset that these people reporting Derpy to Hasbro are invisible.
Snuffsis: theres the possibility that only the itunes ep was changed, not the tv episodes, theres also the possibility that they were just changing her voice from the more masculine to the more feminine and left our her name because people were making such a huge fuss over it either way
she is not gone, there is no proof of that yet
I think this girl has the right idea: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g8yclJPt4I&feature=endscreen&NR=1
Well why not just stop watch ponies altogether? I mean if one pony, who only officially appeared once, being changed upsets you so much, wouldn't it make sense to ragequit?
Soccer Mom, random litigious fucks, mental-health advocates, we don't know who complained.
Ingwaz: The voice is what made derpy truly alive for me, it was a perfect fit for the character, even if it wasn't exactly "feminine" But neither is rainbow dashs voice.
RD sounds like a tenor male.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vMPgnUC_9A&feature=g-logo&context=G2c82404FOAAAAAAAHAA
Now I want a Snails episode just to see what happens.
i agree in that i liked the voice as well, but going around saying that shes gone forever will only further incite panic
lol Nothing will happen, because Snails is a male.
Nobody gives a crap about males. x)
Males being called retarded need to just suck it up.
To some degree.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEqL4vVvii8&feature=endscreen&NR=1
I didn't know that Tranny was a slur.
Well, the funny stuff is that, those who are "offended" aren't even the ones being offended.
^
Let's ask Timmy from South Park. Timmy, what do you think about all this? "TIMMEH! Ti-Ti-Timmeh!" Thanks, Timmy.
CountDoofus get jimmy's opinion too
Jimmy? "Wh-what Timmy sed."
yeah, but Timmy and Jimmy weren't seen as a nuisance.
(uh-oh, I'm sympathizing with the haters)
i'm sure that there were some people with physical differences who were offended by it. However, they are indeed a vocal minority and I grow quite tired of political correctness. But, we must still remain calm and present our case respectfully, otherwise we will only be shut out
but they were also depicted as physically and/or mentally disabled
Ingwaz it is politically incorrect to hide them and discriminate, so Derpy and 'retards' should be more visible
What I like is, Derpy made moralgags butthurt, and now moralfags are making bronies butthurt. Who will the bronies make butthurt?
Or did I misunderstand your statement?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk&feature=related
CountDoofus: And nothing more.
EVERYONE
just be quiet,and listen
I know who the bronies should make butthurt, we should kill peoples' children. :D
It would be like complaining a Zecora simply for being black.
GUYS
like that girl said in the video I linked: this is still a kids show at heart, and the voices of the parents are louder than the voices of the bronies. If Hasbro keeps giving in to the bronies, that's going to cause more problems than solve them
ENOUGH
Kwaklad1: it could be argued that its politically incorrect either way. you're insensitive if you do portray that character, and you're insensitive if you remove that character
and I'm done
Ingwaz: Which is why Derpy didn't need to be canon.
I was satisfied with her as a background character.
ofna01: dont you think its kind of hypocritical to post a save derpy video then come here and shout at us for discussing it calmly?
Ingwaz send me an email at KwakLad@derpymail.org I will show you something once I get home
im tired of the walls of text
Derpy should have another chance to make up for Dropping piano's on twilight's head, ruining Apple-bobbing, and destroying town hall.
heh, *pianos*
I still think Derpy should just have a permanent G Major voice.
well, i'm tired of seeing all the save derpy videos, seen them all already, that one multiple times as i believe you have posted it multiple times, i'm not shouting at you though
I can't believe I'm the only one who thinks so.
I believe so as wel Kammerjunk.
Oh, good.
Kammerjunk: i prefer her original voice to the new one, not only is the new one completely out of time but i just feel the deeper one suited her better
Ingwaz no no its not a video

Flim Flam Bros. Song > Smile Song
wrong link
only yesterday did I finally manage not to flail my tongue when saying "Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000"
Tovler, the sign is going the other way, it's < you're lookin or
Count
i did it perfect the first time
I'm not glad you brought that up, my dear. I say i'm not glad your brought that up.
Its a european ad, it doesnt make a difference http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29_ny2U0vnw
Well i hate flim and flam
Gah, this should not be so hard
well I got a small speech impediment, so it's somewhat harder for me
Hmm, i wonder though
goodmorning :)
ohai Tarku
What is in that cider, drugs?
ohai Jim
the way they're shouting for it...
Eyup
04 days!!!!
I can actually sing the Flim Flam Bros song and do it justice. (sexism, ftw)
Make youtube video
and prove it
That song....
You say I'm overreacting, but you would tooIf a loved one was given, then taken away from youI shed these tears, every drop a memoryNostalgia rolls in, heaven becomes the deepYou didn't like the way she was,So you changed everything
Morning everypony
damn, that song is hard to sing without gettin tongue tied.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHz5-vfMlL8&feature=related
read the lyrics..
Tovler, flim flam song?
non pa-what?
nonpareil, and that's exactly the reason why you see
I Dont want to sing that song
any linux guru's in here? prefferably someone with a large beard
*looks up the meaning of the word nonpareil*
CountDoofus: dat tangential learning
what does non pareil mean?
epic luna http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXUzM4bSSUI
french for "without equal", apparently
aah
it makes sense
but aren't the brothers equals?
it is similar to "not on par"
Phase: sorry, Starswirl the Bearded used Windows
non par = not on par get it?
xD
(sorry for the lame pun)
The brothers are equal, but they are without equals
No one is on par with their stuff.
they're nonpareil as travelling salesponies then
I bet the Koch Brothers could take them out (no-politics)
or Mario Bros.
Mario bros....
Luigi drags the Mario Bros down
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6eyUO66S_g&feature=related this scene... I laugh each and every time
ugh, i don't want to draw graphs

that scene, describes my entire love life
good scene Count
My personal headcanon is that Starswirl was a mare.
i'm supposed to draw y1= 13 sqrt x
i have made my girlfriend a brony
And that she was called Starswirl the Bearded because she invented #25.
round of applause for me?
OH COME ONE!
Good on ya.
Good job, mate.
Oh...My....
"That's an appletree" makes me laugh.

G3.5 is best nightmare fuel
Did anypony see tge newsletter?
The*
G3.5 made me laugh when Pinkie Pie said, I can speak in pink.
I don't get the newsletter.
Probably because I'm an idiot.
I haven't gotten it yet
Well all those werid things happening and RD always dresses in style
my stomach is not happy with me today
i just dont know what went wrong.....
My entire body is not happy with me today.
well, what did you put in there?
oh hasbro,tell us,what went wrong?
And no she doesnt dresses in style
Pinkieruler124: Rainbow Dash did dress in style.
Rainbow Dash always dress in style
But she doesn't do it always.
20% cooler
G3.5 needs to be 100% cooler
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTcyb3CG4XI dis pear, so delicious
100% of 0 is still 0%
Does not compute.
if hasbro brings back derpy,i will buy everyone here a shirt
Yeah, what Jim said.
ofna01: You don't have the dosh.
i do
Yea derpy needs to come back...
Shipping a shirt from the US to here costs about 50 bucks alone.
i will make them myself,with a picture of your favorite pony on the front
lol snuffsis
Oh.
and there was this one good song, but I think it was from G3
crap Kammerjunk where do you live?
Shipping is so expensive it's not even funny
Wait, I probably phrased that wrong.
A shirt from WeLoveFine costs about 50 bucks, shipping included.
Shipping is indeed expensive with gas prices as they are.
i will make them KAmmer
dat shipping: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2KUEc0zXTU
where do you live kammer?
You remind me of Misha, ofna01.
whodat?
Ingwaz: Denmark.
ofna01: A Swedish guy who gave me a shirt with Luna's cutie mark just because.
:/
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
i dont blame derpy
:(
It wasn't his size, so instead of, you know, selling it or something, he gave it away.
flash died on me...
and that sucks for you Kammerjunk
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFZD8YWhGg0
It does. Costed me 100 bucks to get two shirts.
Worth every penny, of course.
costed Xd
...I didn't just say costed, did I+
?*
ouch? i'm surprised its so much even though you ordered 2
yep
Sorry somthing happend
Good Luna, that's embarrassing.
haha, Kammerjunk speaks more than one language
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy1pQE3xsOc
[09:58:28] <Kammerjunk> It does. Costed me 100 bucks to get two shirts.
dat Bronystate
i forgive you, kammerjunk
That is so embarrassing.
Kammerjunk has been practicing his derpenese
/me starts humming dead island theme
And I usually correct my cousin when he uses the semicolon wrong.
How does; one use silly colon wrong?
Kammerjunk 100bucks for two shirts, where the hell from?!
._.
s'alright Kammerjunk, we all make speech derps. I find myself saying the wrong thing far more often then i would care for
I Think i saw derpy in super sqezzey 5000
Snuffsis: From WeLoveFine.
It's the Pacific, you know.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CzcOcBb_ms
Pinkieruler124: shes there
That is expensive, use redbubble.com instead, they're much cheaper. :P
Kammerjunk try redbubble, they are based in the UK so are probably cheaper shipping
I actually saw a Dark Side of the Rainboom shirt recently.
Shame it was also in the US.
When RD says i dbout that derpy is there
Pinkieruler124: yeah we already know, she also makes an appearance in the snow globe in the most recent episode
Ok
ah geez, I just laughed my ass off with the "bronies react to teens react to MLP", and now DI music again? *sadface*
I fell asleep when Wrek was playing Deus Ex, did he finish the game?
dead island music makes me cry
and she was with Dr. Whooves in H&HD with her eyes still derped.
He finished it, yes Kammerjunk
Aww.
/me hums along with dead island theme playing in his other tab
Kammerjunk I missed him finish it too
ofna01: same here
That reminds me, maybe I should close some of the 130-something bucking tabs I have open.

Uggg
nice wall ya got there, fella
that pic's a bit too lavender.
too blue
yeah, she has Dinky's colors in that speed draw.
will derpy at least still be a backround pony at least?
please hasbro?
^probably. but i doubt she'll ever speak again
....
which makes me want to hurt things
Anything could happen in Season 3.
i just dont know what went wrong...
Eyup!
Season 2, it would be way too much effort to alter any derpy cameos at this point.
Season 3 im going to love the first ep
When mlp ends....What is going to happen?
So, we're back on the derpy stuff again?
you know what we need? an art initiative. tons of art. shit-tons of art. derpy art. derpy art like that save derpy vid. assloads of that
Maybe we can form brony conclaves while we all watch Korra.
the people working on the show do browse the community and that would be an effective way to tell them waht we think without shouting in their faces
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObPtGVcV1DA&feature=related
like this?
watching those hens hypnotizes me.
The best thing to do would be to educate the regular crowd of morons from being morons and thinking everything is insulting and not politically correct
Would someone please thinkg of the children?!
honestly, the only way to get derpy hooves back as canon would to be to rid the world of the politicly correct
maybe I should make a drawing of Derpy reacting to the whole situation... I can imagine her sitting in front of a computer, laughing her [yay] off
21/1/12 never forget.
Count
aye?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0
instead of her laughing,she should be sad
blacks?
i'm afraid the black and native references completely flew over the heads of the dipshits that screamed at derpy
I wonder if mexicans in the MLP world are White-tailed deer
it takes lots of stupidity to get offended by something like this
the mexicans are probably the donkeys

what I said earlier, Derpy standing in front of her tombstone, and then her eyes pop to normal, becoming Ditzy Do
i heard you like ponies,so i put ponies in your ponies so you can watch ponies while you watch ponies

The only B movie I can think of is The Last Dragon.
I heard you like humans, so we put a human in a human, so you can give birth.
lolyoujelly
but don't know what to draw next when her eyes become normal
Worst film ever: Skyline
I picked Operation Dumbo Drop last week
Now careful derpy's!

i tunes did all this
hasbro did it too
Oh, I just wanted to blame the Pegasi.
they has to reanimate the scenes she was in
had*
So, the complainers went directly to iTunes.
i guess
they sholdnt have MLP there in the first place!
But podcasters can't even get ahold of iTunes
Oh shit i just remembered
Friends. We are gathered here today, as you are all aware, to pay our last tributes and respects﻿ to the memory of our departed friend, Derpy Hooves. When this video first aired fans rejoiced at her voice the lord has given her. Now we mourn her death out of censorship orgonizations that have killed joy across our nation; 4kids, SOPA, FCC, and now this.
Im going to check something...be right back
need to get good heaphones, brb
SOPA 4KIDS FCC DID ALL THIS!?
ofna01: I think you're forgetting a very important bill, seeing how SOPA and PIPA were "ultimately shelved".
join me........in saluting CAPTAIN DERPY HOOVES! *jets fly over*
GUYS IS THIS LIVE
i didnt make that kammer
Aha.
copied from a youtube vid
except for the last part
On January 24, 2012 4Kids Entertainment's Toonzai site reported via its Facebook page that traffic to the site has risen 20%, in the days following the United States government's closure of the Megaupload file-sharing service.
but, I'm always mad at 4kids, so w/e
OH SHIT Johnjoseco opened commisions today i completly forgot
ACTA is happening in europe
cant believe they closed Megaupload
Ohh i tunes if it wasnt for you this wouldnt be happening
and they're planning on blocking pirate bay to those in UK
sharklion: http://xkcd.com/1022/

Sopa needs to go

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ERSVtU571k
R.I.P Derpy
who in here disagrees with derpy getting removed?
>The United States, Australia, Canada, Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Morocco, and Singapore signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) at a ceremony on October 1, 2011, in Tokyo
SOPA went, ACTA is it's son out for rewvenge
practiacally every brony on this earth Cloud
Stop saying derpy is gone...
No
I have her next to me
so, SOPA and PIPA were actually a diversion.
The US have signed ACTA.
Acta is sopa on steroids
Or has.
no we havent Kammer
Derpy is still here
they shelved it
Look at my link.
I Saw her
I can't wait for the internet to become as crappy as the radio.
Last Roundup will re-air sometime after Wednesday March 7, thats as far ahead as my dish network guide can go atm
It was signed the 1st of October in Tokyo.
i've seen love come,seen it shot down,seen it die in vain
It passed in ireland but not anywhere else I knnow of
Land of the Free indeed
Im still certain its only the itunes version that was changed
08,01this is great: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pD-gElyNd9ogmTk1cu_4JReAd6O8wqLHW7w05kwTM_Q/edit?hl=en_GB&pli=1
sarcasm Tovler?
STOP!!!!
08,01ofna01: did you break the internet?

Kammerjunk: i finally got back to doing this Brony survey thing and notice that one of the questions asks if i "Strongy Agree" with something

NOPONY SAYS THINGS ABOUT DERPY!!!
Still an awesome.
good morrow
Pinkieruler124: Things about Derpy.
Aye
I think Derpy needs a mourning.
sorry pinkie,but she's as good as dead
saying things about Derpy is censored here?
We should mourn Derpy.
aye,xcan
sigh, why does nopony stream through this at the moment!
ill put on music
Uggg derpy is still here...You just cant spot her well
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfmYCM4CS8o&ob=av3e
Without Derpy, how will survive this election season?
I'd vote for Vermin Supreme.
He wants everyone in the US to have a pony.
08,01i like derpy's new voice
still no stream
08,01it sounds like balddumborat
Derpy's new voice sounds like it was voiced by Ashleigh.
voice is fine,but the name censoring is just too far
He needs to change is name to Varmint Supreme.
and didn't they change the eyes?
08,01well, yeah
its like,HERE'S A COOKIE,OH WAIT,IM GONNA TAKE IT BACK
08,01not only that, but rainbow dash's lines were delivered so much better in the other take
Derpy doesnt have her derp eyes your saying?
They were, yeah.
Derpy's new voice sounds too sincere; like she purposefully destroyed Town Hall.
one thing i never got though...
ofna01: More like: Here's a muffin!
why was derpy jumping on a cloud?
08,01Pinkieruler124: she still derps
ofna01: Because Derpy.
Ok
08,01ofna01: for the lulz
yes
at least derpy went out in a blaze of glory
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfmYCM4CS8o&ob=av3e
derpy will be best pony forever

Let's get down to business!
To defeat the Huns.
/me walks away
Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?
Pinkies
could you mention that i showed the video to you?
Can Fluttershy save the show from becoming just a cartoon beholden to decency standard this Saturday?
Fluttershy can do anything.
You ponies are acting as if Derpy was the only thing carrying the show.
^
at least we still have fluttershy
fluttershy will do all things
I watch it for the plot, not Derpy.
fluttershy will be next
Until the Last Roundup, Derpy was an easter egg.
You still liked the show back then.
ofna01: i'll mention your da if you have one
It's not called my little derpy
KAmmer,but still,its like,OK WE HEAR YOU GUYs,WE NAMED HER YOUR NICKNAME,OH NEVER MIND
Although I can't argue that My Little Derpy WOULDN'T be epic.
the derpy fanfics are epic
You still have to consider that Hasbro's number 1 concern is money.
Despite what Studio B might think.
ofna, you have a da?
no
Look it's not hasbro's falt its i tunes
i blame itunes

I don't like iTunes either way.

What the...Derpy and doc are not in love!
I'm so happy now *looks at the Save Derpy video*
Well, Derpy might be like one of the doctors companions

Wow.

Mah laptawp is too slow...
4th?
08,01i totally did.
08,01(i wish)
08,01unfortunately, a dyspraxic sloth with a crayon could draw better than me
08,01they're not
Pinkie4th?
Ah, ok.
I need to get into digital painting and comics.
I can do fine art.
08,01in fact, it's been demonstrated that elephants can draw better than i can
aaw, that's so nice of you to say. thanks for the compliment :$
wanna see my latest wokr?
Roz Ryan should have voiced Derpy.
I might have another late night tonight... I'm too energetic to sleep.
Hit us Cuddly

08,01KwakLad: that's dyscalculaia
Was working on it during the Friday stream.
08,01or however it's spelled
/me has S2 Luna on screen; is all "SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
... wow
(posted a few preview pics here)
08,01dyspraxia is a disorder of motor planning
08,01from the latin praxis, meaning to plan
08,01or somethign along those lines
08,01an elephant drew this: http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/20/article-1151283-0395826B000005DC-632_233x357.jpg
08,01it's better than i could do
I Have the cmc on my desktop P:
It's also partially about finding a style that you're confertable with, as well as a medium
comfortable*
I have trixie on my desktop
I have Derpy.
I have Vinyl on my desktop.
I have a black screen on my desktop.
...
(Used to be Filly rarity yelling at a rock)
LOL!
I have Luna, Luna, and… whoa 3 Lunas on my desktops
people tell me my drawings looks great, while I think they're fugly
Oh my http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TcddoSCB8I&feature=related :o
i have a foal twilight on my desktop atm
Jim: Holy...
The odds of my have the same 3 desktops is fairly low
08,01CuddlyKittens11: you're like the millionth person to say this to me. trust me, hun, i've tried.
wow
08,01i'll just stick to writing music
Heres a definition of art : if you give a mokey a crayon , he will eat it , if you give infinite mokeys crayons , they will eat them , but as infinity goes , an infinite number o them will poop art . So monkey + crayon = art , when in fact its just poop. Stick with what you like , ignore experts!
Hold on im going to the main six
ConuntDoofus: Can I ask whay type of style you're trying to do?
this is my background atm http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/21631?search=ponies_the_anthology
08,01CuddlyKittens11: but then what if i task you with writing a symphony? does your argument still hold up then?
>mfw that random long-haired grey pegasus in McDonalds becomes the new Derpy.
Jim, that is one awesome luna, did you have some part in it?
08,01people who say you just need to practice art to be good at it take their natural talent for granted
I had no part in it, I just found the video
And sprinkles
cya, got food to eat
Bye sharklion
never felt more loved
CuddlyKittens11: I've just taken my first steps of drawing at the beginning of this month. so far, it's all hand-drawn, using vectors as reference points
I'm better at writing Novels then art myself.
08,01CuddlyKittens11: i can listen to a piece of music, pick out the melodies and harmonies and play them on the piano off the cuff. is this just a case of practice, or is it natural talent?
08,01i'd argue a bit of both
CoutDoofus: they are much better than most people I've seen to start drawing. Does your school offer art classes?
I Dont have it i was just messing around
08,01but without the talent, there's only so much that practice will do
I'm not in school anymore... I'm 27 :p
did everyone stop talking or something?
Ee-nope.
o hai
CountDoofus: Oh, lol. Local Community College offer art classes?
sooo what exactly is this???
essentially, it was saying the opposite of what you are
is this a stream or summit???
natural talent, if it even exists, can only really get you so far
Im going shopping , again , anypony know how to ake PMVs ? or even does them on request ?
Im good at drawing just still in 4th...
Big, there's no stream at the moment
eh, haven't really checked. not sure if drawing is something I plan to keep on doing for years, so might be a waste of money in the end
practice is what makes you good at things, full stop.
so what exactly is the stream Jim?
08,01ScootaChicken: what was the conclusion?
CountDoofus: Community College courses are Hella-cheap. I think the supplies might be more expensive in the long run.
usually its whatever admins are doing at the time
Well, there might be a stream later when someone who can stream gets online
let's take a real world example: Mozart evidently had a lot of musical talent, but the only reason he could compose operas at the age of 10 was because of the stupid amount of practicing he did
Oh...My...God....
piano was essentially his life, there was practically nothing else.
yeah but Jim what is the stream actually OF?
08,01ScootaChicken: this is true
it's quite like all the Asian maths/violin/piano prodigies you always hear about (and my mum wants me to become so I don't bring shame upon the family >.>)
Big, sometimes there's TV-shows, animes, games, live pony drawings etc.
it's because their parents/themselves force them to do a ridiculous amount of practicing
08,01ScootaChicken: i know the feeling... *sigh* asian parents...
and that's what makes them so good
wait...they do anime here?!?!?!? i gotta come here more often
Scoota!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
huh, kay, also Jim um when is the new mlp aired? and where?
!cd
Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 4 days, 23 hours, 1 minutes, 38 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
It's next saturday
I've got a German mother, she acts like an asian parent.
where?
08,01ScootaChicken: see, that's the thing thouhg. i've worked with, and taught, asian "virtuosos". most of them are actually shit and have no musicality
Here
o
08,01technically proficient
08,01sometimes to the extreme
08,01but that alone doesn't make a great, or even good, musician
exactly.
The friday stream which is counting down up there is a movie night where we see two movies and two old MLP episodes
Big: if you watch it here its here if you mean on tv its on the hub network
08,01i lack the talent needed to do even basic visual composition
08,01i mean, hell, i know composition rules and techniques
One can be able to play the solo from Stairway To Heaven in it's entirety, but that just makes them really good at copying notes
Cuddly: I'm also not in the States, so I'll have to look around for art classes. never bothered to look for such, so...
08,01y'know though, i've never taken any art classes
Big, nope the stream is shown everywhere
/me walks away
08,01or really tried hard to better myself at art
08,01certainly haven't practiced a lot
CountDoofus: Oh, ok. That makes things a bit harder. Just go out an buy some books about art. It's what I've been doing lateley.
08,01maybe i'll give it a go
i cant wait til the new ep
yeah, I've bought one today. have yet to look inside, though :D
What's the book called?
/me Jumps around
oh you wouldn't know it, it's a local one (in Dutch)
Ah.
See if you can get one that talks about "The Elements of Art," and "The Principles of Design."
/me Stops jumping
Chances there are no books titled that, the are conecpts in art.
"The elements of Art," are more important than the "Principales of Design," BTW.
people have recommended I should get "Keys to Drawing" by Bert Dodson
hey Jim, what if i miss the new mlp, can i just watch it on youtube?
CountDoofus: Never heard of that one.
The episode will probably be on youtube a while after the new episode have aired, Big.
http://books.google.be/books/about/Keys_to_Drawing.html?id=E9AnudWoHRkC&redir_esc=y
Eyup!
ZOMG
I LOVE THIS
hmm... any way i can get it faster Jim???
i can move ponies manually!
CountDoofus: Okay, I might have seen that one before.
heh... I think my latest drawing is going to generate so much hate
Errmm
hello
You might also want to pick up a book called "Drawing on the Right side of the brain."
ConutDoofus: how come?
hello, pony_5325
Not quite sure, have heard that he episodes are released on iTunes too, but not sure how fast they get up there
howitgoing?
kk ill see all u guuys on friday, hopefully
/me smile's evily
byyyye
