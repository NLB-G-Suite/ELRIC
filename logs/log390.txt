09,01x3
KINDNESS AND GENEROSITY BITCHES :3
I haven't played Yu-Gi-Oh in forevur
09,01I would play Magic
09,01but when I was going to buy a deck

Po-Ni-Oh
09,01went bankrupt
09,01so DERP
oh i agree
I stumbled across a wallpaper not long ago of Trixie and Twilight playing Magic and couldn't stop laughing :P
09,01I used to play Duel Masters, which is Magic Lite though
09,01and by Play I mean
13no really i'm like terrible...

There's a card that costs something like 1.5 million to play and is basically an auto-win.
there is one card

XD
you have sparked my interest with that
04o_o
le me: FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
04I understood nothing
it was nice, because the dwarven warriors could make another creature with power 2 or less unblockable for a turn, and the Shockers were 1/1 creatures that whenever they dealt damage to an opponent, that opponent had to discard all cards in their hand and draw that many cards from their deck.
thats the thing XD

It was heartbreaking
"Be careful, you don't want to do more damage then you've you've alrready done."

it isn't their fault at all. but they could've at least changed it to something less half assed

08,01why can't any of you use "your" and "you're" correctly?
lol
Why not watch "The Deluge" It's a 315minute long movie about Sweden invading Poland. :D
wtf
08,01"your" - denotes posession
08,01"you're" - a contraction of "you are"
^
08,01seriously guys, learn grammar
I'm picking Fiddler on the Roof for A.
/me has been trying to improve his use of contractions
anyone in particular you're talking to, Saturn?
The want the difference between Its and It's?
Don't forget Its'
very important
never mind my last, just found it
Saturn would probably like this clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4vf8N6GpdM
Well Saturn, I'm glad you brought that up, my dear. I say, I'm glad you brought that up.
inb4 intro reminds me of Inglorious Basterds
Haha.
08,01"it's" = "it is", or posessive of "it"
08,01nothing else
08,01wait, no, that's wrong
08,01"its" is possessive
haha
08,01f[yay]k grammar. i'm gonna go eat some ponies and watch some burgers
Where is it is head?
08,01Tovler: aye
Can you differentiate between Sisters, Sister's and Sisters' ? :P
And "a unicorn's magic matches the color its eyes."
Sisters = plural of sister
i didnt know that
Jm sister's = Sister is. :P
derp
Sisters' would be something she owns.
Been 5 years since I had English in school

Wow, really?
No McDonalds at all?
McDonalds suck!
"sucks".
Well, there's 600 kilometers to the nearest McDonalds
Yeah, the 's' does not make it plural.
finished filling the bronystudy :D
or would it be "Unicorns' magic matches the color of their eyes?"
I live in a city of 50'000 inhabitants
" A Unicorns magic matches..." and "Those Unicorns' magic matches...."
*sniff* that was good japan
I only want the McDonalds toys for their show-accurate Fluttershy
yeah

No, i'm only squaring once. I guess it's my fault for directly translating fro mswedish to english. xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3LPmA5tk2U&feature=related
08,01so that's then: (13 ^ 2 sqrt^2(x)) * (13 ^ 2 sqrt^2(x))

08,01and those sqrts are cancelled out

WOOHOO!
Yea, well it's called "Kvadrering" in swedish, which, when directly translated becomes quadrating or something like that.
THAT WAS AWESOME
kernels fine
cuz you dont have the right power settings
it just wont hibernate
08,01ah, okay
08,01but yeah, squaring both sides of that gives (13^2)x = x^2 + 36^2

to prove that derpy is gone
sorry eman
they edited her name out of last roundup
its all speculatio
they got rid of dash calling her derpy
and?
they un-derped her eyes
changed her voic
she could still be in future episodes
NO SHES NOT
well, she officially demoted to background character.
if they get rid of her like that,she's not coming back
NO SHES NOT
any proof?
you do realize that derpy was origionally NOT derpy
we have plenty of proof supporting she's gone
In my opinion, even if they make her not canon, she's still Derpy for us
I think Derpy didn't need to be canon in the first place.
you cant say thr
that
even if they had to change her, it is not hasbro's fault
people are overreacting
they knew we loved Depy,got rid of her,just like that
i gotta go
alright eman

i dare you to watch through that without tearing up

epic luna http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXUzM4bSSUI
french for "without equal", apparently
aah
it makes sense
but aren't the brothers equals?
it is similar to "not on par"
non par = not on par get it?
xD
(sorry for the lame pun)
The brothers are equal, but they are without equals
they're nonpareil as travelling salesponies then

Eyup!
Season 2, it would be way too much effort to alter any derpy cameos at this point.
the people working on the show do browse the community and that would be an effective way to tell them waht we think without shouting in their faces

The best thing to do would be to educate the regular crowd of morons from being morons and thinking everything is insulting and not politically correct

Although I can't argue that My Little Derpy WOULDN'T be epic.
the derpy fanfics are epic

http://fav.me/d4r03ee
08,01KwakLad: that's dyscalculaia
08,01or however it's spelled
/me has S2 Luna on screen; is all "SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
... wow
(posted a few preview pics here)
08,01dyspraxia is a disorder of motor planning
08,01from the latin praxis, meaning to plan
08,01or somethign along those lines
I Have the cmc on my desktop P:
It's also partially about finding a style that you're confertable with, as well as a medium
comfortable*
I have trixie on my desktop
I have Derpy.
...
LOL!
I have Luna, Luna, andâ¦ whoa 3 Lunas on my desktops
people tell me my drawings looks great, while I think they're fugly
Oh my http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TcddoSCB8I&feature=related :o
i have a foal twilight on my desktop atm
The odds of my have the same 3 desktops is fairly low
08,01CuddlyKittens11: you're like the millionth person to say this to me. trust me, hun, i've tried.
wow
08,01i'll just stick to writing music
Saturn: Try harder, ;)
ConuntDoofus: Can I ask whay type of style you're trying to do?
this is my background atm http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/21631?search=ponies_the_anthology
Saturn's picture is now my desktop. and the saturn was a desktop
cya, got food to eat
never felt more loved
08,01CuddlyKittens11: i can listen to a piece of music, pick out the melodies and harmonies and play them on the piano off the cuff. is this just a case of practice, or is it natural talent?
08,01i'd argue a bit of both
I Dont have it i was just messing around
I'm not in school anymore... I'm 27 :p
did everyone stop talking or something?
Ee-nope.
o hai
is this a stream or summit???
usually its whatever admins are doing at the time
let's take a real world example: Mozart evidently had a lot of musical talent, but the only reason he could compose operas at the age of 10 was because of the stupid amount of practicing he did
it's because their parents/themselves force them to do a ridiculous amount of practicing
08,01ScootaChicken: i know the feeling... *sigh* asian parents...
wait...they do anime here?!?!?!? i gotta come here more often
Scoota!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Saturn: I'm just glad that only one of my parents is Asian
!cd
It's next saturday
where?
Here
o
08,01technically proficient
08,01sometimes to the extreme
08,01but that alone doesn't make a great, or even good, musician
exactly.
One can be able to play the solo from Stairway To Heaven in it's entirety, but that just makes them really good at copying notes
/me walks away
08,01certainly haven't practiced a lot
08,01maybe i'll give it a go
yeah, I've bought one today. have yet to look inside, though :D
What's the book called?

08,01CuddlyKittens11: i had a look into that,a ctually
08,01apparently, it's a load of bullshit
08,01according to a few phsychologists i know

Saturn: You know that book is about the theory and philosophy of drawing, nothing to do with psychology?
