13i think i saw this movie way too many time when cartoon network would spam it...
scoot, too late
"I'm not crying, I have something in my eye. And my other eye. And my heart."
And thus the world was saved thanks to... The powerPuff Girls1
And then the atomic cloud fell upon the entire planet
No fallout. TOo high up.

Birdbitch
Okay good, it's not spoiler it's a spoiler if you talk about the episode
No! Im a chicken!
lol kick?
XC
Does the title count?
Let the evidence conclude that Gilda is a Bitch
0,5Episode titles and synopsises are spoilers
i'm pretty sure gilda is a lesbian, and RD was her lover at some point
Gilda WILL be made into cupcakes
DERPDERPDERPDERP: if u saw the latest episode there is a funeral
there needs to be more griffon characters to redeem the race. Assuming Gilda never gets to reconcile her behaviour
Titles are not spoilers thats ridiculous
That kick
HMMPF
0,5And linke to synopsises are as well
That's bullshit. To be blunt.
my ass they are spoilers
Pinkie rage <3
JarlCelestia: Now I know.
[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn: High School Lesbians?
MEANIE
Once again, Twilight completely discounts what Pinkie says.
/me thunk and thunk and thunk til his thunker couldn't thunk no more " I shall add Ferngully, Anastasia, and Cats Don't Dance to my list of A movies to choose randomly for the lottery, and Quest for Camelot to B"
this no longer appeals to little girls

Discord's the closest.
All ponies are at least 46,000 eons old as they are ageless and deathless.
prolly
ok nevermind
yeahhh homie G!
god damn it
Altough I LOVE Discord
Flim flam for best antagonist?
no granny smith is like 67
Hheehehhe
StinkoMan, yes more villains, not more angsty jerks
Trixie can suck on a napalm and matchhead sandwich.
lag still
actually, latest episode proved they have funerals
brb trying something else
:D
must be mips
Karma~
I mean in Pony years
Flim Flim are awesome
False: The latest episode had a funeral that Sweetie Bell interrupted with her singing.
SS/DT I hate, but I love Trixie, Gilda, The Flim Flam brothers
oh yeah :(
seems legit
that epic 4th wall breaking
^
dat dribble glass
therefore, death does exist
granny smith is older than celestia
Trolololol
i mean in human years
Oh that Karma : 3
COLGATE IS TIME LORD
sHES A DRAGON
granny smith is one year older than Princess Celestia
forget lemon drops, go for sugar!
laglag
Win
I like tixie as well but gilda can go die in ditch
wat
no
Never open the cylibnder.
The Flim Flam Brothers are also awesome
Well ponies only live to be about 35-40, so that does change things.
how is granny smith older
Cake Time is best time
00,03Fluffy <3
DAT MANE
I hate Trixie. And I dislike SS/DT, everyone else gets a pass.
The others are really just lacking one or two elements of harmony
I love Trixie...
Yep, it was me who pranked AJ. I spent days planning it.
GOD DAMN STREAM WON'T LOAD
Because Flim and Flam are just so CORNY
Gilda not a villain, just an angsty Jerk
It was the funeral for the cancer pony who's slippers dash stole in the episode before.
dat...squeak?
The FLim-Flams are lacking honesty.
magic *snort* snort*
Cake is a lie
PUFF
poof
NEVER THE CYLINDER FIRST
seems legit
Squee
xD
I just don't understand. WHY do you like Trixie?
awkawrd spike.....
Gilda lacks Kindness
wheres derpy
StinkomanFan: inb4 ss/dt get a song and you start liking them
What is there to like?
flutter eyes
hehe
She's an ass
00,03Its so funny!
fire
Meanwhile: She's a bitch..I love bitches
Flim and Flam are something out of 60's Batman
;)
dont give what you cant take, gilda
I think for this show's sake, Ponies in Equestria have a similar life span to ours
You can't blow dose candles, Gilda. Rainbow dash set them up.
Pinkie deception~
I hate that Trixie is way more popular than the Flim Flam Brothers.
exazzly
i hate those things
suddenly worst villian/antagonist chat
Oh so you're the type who likes being kicked in the crotch during intercourse TOY_PON3.
0,14*squee*
If you can't take the heat, Gilda!!!
Why are there candle>
SS/DT are like Cleopatra from Clone High, but without the Sexy
If you can't take the heat!!!
gilda may be a bitch, but she's pretty cool looking
Spike can't blow out the candles! he'd just set them on fire again!
00,03burned..
Srawberry
Meanwhile: Well not like that...lmao
I'm confused. Is Trixie actually good with magic or is she just not ass good as Twilight?
The only GOOD part about her!
Damn right, Gilda, eat your just desserts...and like them....
derpy is right ere~~~
is this lag just me
Caterpillar Spike
Cake swimming biatch!!
did trixie ever sing a catchy song? I didn't think so
thats not so sanitary spike
"Always remember, don't trust Zebras!" said Rainbow Dash.
pin the knife on the Griffon
Spike does not care
Contamiated the cake!
;)
Trixie isn't...bad at magic. But she isn't good.
Trixie grew on me
Squee
She's...average.
SQUEE
Okay Trixie is no Twilight but she's still cool
Like a wart

Gildastache
yes...
I identify with charactors trying to get people to focus on them
on the.....crudely drawn pony.
RAGE
I suspect Apple Jack is Twenty Two years old, I assume that (in the last round up) when they said she was the ten year champion, she started entering when she was twelve (feels like a good number) also proves Aj is def over 16
And then Gilda ripped Pinkie's head off.
Dum bish.
YAYA

I would want a Boater hat anyway

I just like to listen to the beutiful language and peice together a random plot
In a nutshell, all movies that enacted the WMC truly deserved it.
That's about average length for a Bollywood movie
05,15that was a joke
so A is english and B is indian?
goddamnit
India: It's basically Disney World
no

Besides, this probably isn't that bad. I read the plot synopsis on IMDB. Looks ok.
Commence termination of all communism!

Meanwhile: you should
This proves music is wonderful no matter what language~
Is anyone here actually from India, by any chance?
