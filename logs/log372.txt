Alo?
yeeeah. I'm already about to ditch this movie
hope no one's watching a bollywood movie for the plot
I just like to listen to the beutiful language and peice together a random plot
In a nutshell, all movies that enacted the WMC truly deserved it.
That's about average length for a Bollywood movie
05,15that was a joke
goddamnit
no
if dari liked it
bunty and bumblebee
Is there are stream tonight?
Besides, this probably isn't that bad. I read the plot synopsis on IMDB. Looks ok.
Commence termination of all communism!
00,03its reall 290 min
/me gives everypony hamburgers, because Indians think cows are sacred
it was probably WMC worthy
It looks nicer than it did in Slmdog Millionare.....

Also, guys, be prepared for absolutely no tonal consistency. Bollywoof movies have a tendency to switch genres from musical to drama to comedy in a matter of minutes.
