the end of high school exams
0,5I had mid-terms this week
I've got 7 maths modules in May.
That's just maths.
Fleur, its the British equivalent of SATS I think
English high school qualifications, don't know if they have the same in US.
0,5I did great on my mid-terms! ^_^
oooohhhhh
0,5:D
so you're in year 11?
the UK has SATs in primary (elementry) school
for some reason, my high school needed classes for passing the exit exams
ScootaChicken: SAT is for college. I think...
0,5Its called Junior Year here in the U.S.
0,5:3
Im in year 11
/me doesnt know now
I shall be back, making maple sausages
Fleur, its high school exams basically
and half of my class was in there
I think...
at least
I'm year 12 ScootaChicken.
Sixth Form. :D
and your a mod? how old are you? surely you are 17
16
I started out as a mod at 15 though
D:
I'm in year 12 now
I thought you had to be 18 to be a mod.
no
that wasnt said anywhere
nope Gumri, I'm 14 and I was offered an interview
I didn't pass it though
aye
/me facehoofs
I asked for one
but didn't apply
Mods. We need a liarjack emoticon

how long you been on?
Don't worry about it bro.
Dken2021: Since 7 hours ago at most. I joined this channel not too long ago
mfw I was talking to Luna and she said I would probably make a good mod and asked why I didnt put in an aplication.
see, dari can be a cool guy, unlike that stiff Wrek

Orangejack?
Something isn't right here.
back to where I started the stream from
Gumri bwahah.
RawketLawnchair: You saw nothing.
I wanted to be a mod at one point but then realised i am too lazy!
or he saw everything
I see everything!
it's a loop
Dat's pretty awsum.
I know, everything!
And then the chat died.
eeyup
indeed
I say
i just realized my crush from high school resembles twilight sparkle
sorry, I had to plug in my netbook and couldnt keep the chat rolling :p
aha
yfw your crush resembles a pony

I just realized that I didnt have a crush in high school

it reminds me of diamond from minecraft
Love can be painful, and sometimes that pain involves retina burning
lolwut
Im going to be all alone on valintines day... Again...
eh, could be worse
Gumri: I'me going to be for the first time in 5-6 years
I'd send you a valentines card Gumri, but I'm not sure how much you'd appreciate that
yea, could have a demanding girlfriend and uses all of your money
eeyup
kirzstryfe: I know what the color options are. try 4,9

lets not talk about that
Dken2021: Or an ex-wife like that..

I honestly have no idea how long I've been up

/me has had it sence she first watched Stare Master
I think 21 hours with 4 hours sleep then 28 hours on 5 then 52 on 4
what is it Fleur?
ohai Dumori
it's all a blur of illness and insonia

If I say it, someone will steal my idea

I won't steal it :3

no

ohai Arentius ^_^
Hmm, I have mixed feelings about that guys choich of weapon for fluttershy.
wait....i thought adblocker plus would disable ads?
valoreins, those are awesome!
but my opinion on Fluttershy is that she should be like a summoner :p
valoreins, that site is blocked by my school's internet filter :(
a whip... yea i'm a bit confused for her weapon :(
aww shit
got to go guys
see ya
Later
toodles
the passive types are confusing for a setting that involves fighting
Whoa, how'd we go from black ops to what ever this is?
yeah
Heya ScootaCHicken
it's a odd playlist
and this is NiGHTS
yay for delayed responses
spike doesnt reallys eem like a dagger user, more of a longsword or broadsword
X = I don't like fighting, but I'm gonna shoot you because that's why
/me can't see the stream D:
Oh, ok. I never played NiGHTS so I didn't know
yeah
11,14I never played it, trippy
neither have I
i'm thinking daggers cause lil kids shouldn't play with big swords, yet :P
I don't know why, but this game makes me think of a slower paced sonic.
Ingwaz|Laptop: Lance? He's already been pictured with one
perhaps, but, when it comes to battle, a dagger can be just as dangerous as a sword
spike wouldn't need weapons - he's a dragon
a lance considering his size would seem like a bad idea
he has natural weapons - claws; breath, etc
if he were an adult, then a lance would work
yeah
but Spike is a baby dragon, remember?
I suppose Rarity could fit the whip thing, but seems fluttershy took that though
so? your arm is now paying a visit to Princess Celestia
his scales and claws aren't that tough yet
ummm
and when i say "your arm," i mean only your arm
doesn't really work that way I think
fluttershy seems fine with a whip, rarity, being a unicorn could probably use magic and a shield
no proof that it doesn't yet
Whoa, weird.
like a red mage?
besides, he's not even strong enough to overpower a single Diamond Dog
and then even failing, that it effectively turns his breath weapon into a FFVII Summoning Materia
breath fire, send it to Celestia, let her deal with it
that's too op
and Twilight isn't?
well
so
hmmm
as far as we know
Twi doesn't know any offensive spells
wait...are we playing nights or mw?
i'm thoroughly confused
it keeps flipping
it's a playlist
It's not mw, it black ops
it's on a playlist loop
you could always use the Fallout Equestria style of Spike's sending magic
yeah
you are literally being burned to ashes, but reassembled at the destination

11,14dragonfire can transport your body, but what about your soul
damn got disconected
but we've seen she can't use it to really grab and hold things
kirzstryfe: your text is kind of hard to read
or at least not smack things with it
otakon - i beg to differ
perhaps a darker background color would help
oh smack things, yeah probably
but that doesn't mean it's not a hell of an immoblization spell (Rainbow Dash's tail)_
okay, ONE TIME she did the whole Ursa Minor thing
otakon...are we gonna have to debate again for an hour?
probably

i imagine it was intentional...you know....friendship is magic?
I saw no joke...
please explain it?
we noticed
Hey Bronystate!!
/me huggles all the Mods
It's like, hate is the opposite of friendshi
hello
i'm guessing the joke is, its my little pony: friendship is magic
and the lines were "dont hate me"
HAY
lines to what?
there we go
yeah... musical tourettes kicked in there
/me facehoofs again
i give up

Yes please valoreins , I like hay
no more grounding out now
oh chill fleur, it was 3 letters
hay fries, extra crispy
so, what I miss?
i've seen people and mods alike use more than that before
Just did the BMN Survey. Totally forgot about it :$
Mods can use allcaps as much as they like Ingwaz
it's in the newsletter
11,14survey links are 1 time use, sent out in the newsletter
ahh, didnt know that
yep
there we go
sign up for the newsletter
i wasnt talking to you on that one fleur
11,14are you on the email list for it Ingwaz?
much better, my signal is good now
it's MY LINK. NOT YOUR'S!!! MINE!!! (I love Loopholes)
and i doubt mods are allowed to spam all caps
ther are
they're allowed to use all caps as much as they want regardless of the situation?
now, can someone tell me wth we were talking about? something to do with song lyrics that I didnt see posted?
my signal is stilll bad, i'm just here for the chat XD
I came here for the chat
kirzstryfe: not sure if you saw me say it earlier, but your text is pretty hard to read
11,14yeah, working on it
^
the stream is not interesting
its just black ops ^^
gonna play some Jedi Knight II now. BRB
And so, SuperBrony64 lost the award of Hardest text to Read
a darkbackground or just black would work really well
kirzstryfe: try using a darker grey
May the Force be with you
amen
And may the friendship be with you
/me is bored and cant fucking wait for fighting is magic
11,5 that one is the dark grey
When will Fighting is Magic be out?
when they finish it
Dat bacon font
0,5Oh right
0,5My story
/me is still perched atop LordCelestia's head
0,5Anyways, when I made my OC he has firey hair, but Scootachicken called it bacon.
0,5And it just kinda caught on
/me idly noms on LordCelestia's mane
yeah
kirzstryfe: try the dark green bg with that teal text
because it LOOKS like BACON
0,5Then Shy drew a picture and said bacon mane, and I told her to include a hammer and banana cutie mark
0,5:3
the fighting game, they still doing the Rarity voice audience?
11,(dark green)
valoreins: no idea, maybe
11,3 yeah, it's still hard to read
ugh
0,5I can see it fine
not really
I can see it wonderfully
try green bg orange letters!
i don't know why, but whenver LC's text linewraps for me, the second line of text switches back to black font
orange is off limits
1,3 can't use orange otakon
why not?
5,3 Luna's color
and that works good actually
0,5Orange belongs to Woona
It is Luna's and she is admin
ORANGE on GREEN
not JUST ORANGE
13mod recolors
0,5Even though I use dark red and Wrek used Dark red :3
7,3 orange on green, doesn't work
yeah
I was SO wrong
>.< better than orange on red
so very wrong
reverse?
0,5x3
try a dark green and dark bluer?
blue*
orange is Luna's and nobody is allowed to use it in any part of their color (which I think is kinda dumb but *shrugs* oh well)
/me facehoofs
mods cant even share colors slightly?
same with Ghosties' red
mods can
Somepony play DF?
1,3 trust me, I've been testing colors for a week
just not with Admins
DF?
DWARF FORTRESS
why not just go with a text color and not a background color?
oh, nope, never heard of it
because they are all taken
basically
all singular text colors are taken?
basically
how is that possible?
1,3singular colors cut out a lot of combinations that would use that color
GODDAMNITdaribot!
either that or they are just reeeeeeallly hard to read without a bg
well grey and black haven't been taken, but I think you know the reason
so, if say, someone uses dark green, you cant use light green?
no, you can
how about black on grey bg?
they are just both taken
wait wait wait.
so use a variation of another color
re
1,3if someone uses light green, you can't use light green on either a black or white background
1,3because different clients use different backgrounds for their windows
I never played this game in my life but know from bronystate how to beat this boss...
so, use a different hue of a color so its still noticably different
maybe I spend too much time here
13ingwaz there are only sixteen colors
^
derpy_derpy: haha :D
1,3i.e. Shizuka uses just pink, which shows up as pink on black in mibbit, and pink on white in mirc
I still find this game weird
so, you're not allowed to use the same color at all as an admin? that seems rather limiting
and apparently, some are off limits. even as a bg color.
/me thinks that is dumb
1,3lol, it can be
never been a fan of nintendo games
1,3and there are a lot of combinations that are out because they don't combine well
8,11 like this one
13such as either straight blue
DCD is an admin and therefore his green cant be used in /any/ combo
ouch kirzstryfe
13dark blue is invisible against black, and light blue is barely better
I can't read that one very good though kirzstryfe
dark blue with red, or vice versa
1,3that's the point lol
I dont have a prob seeing the dark blue on black
What in the name of Celestia?
?
13http://screensnapr.com/v/SNEbbx.png
dat Rayman
Back~
13dark blue is nigh invisible
I know, the stream is weird sometimes, it's on auto now
1,3then you have the combinations that are very close to other mods' colors
seems like a very limiting system
Ahh, ok. That explains it. Sorry, it's my first time here.
/me must have great eyesight
considering that to log in as yourself, you must know the password
Lol at user has ragequitted
/me didnt have a problem seeing the dark blue
I would advise you to click the #bronystate in the left bottom corner, that's where the fun is at
1316 colors, take 2, order matters... that's 16 nPr 2, that's 16!/(16-2)!
13there are 240 possible colors period
13then you start removing failed combos
0,2 Which 0,12 one 15,2 of 15,12 us 11,2 is 11,12 SB?
but you have to take out black, white, and all colors used by admins too
13eeyup
I think "is" XD
something like dat anyways..
/me personally thinks the admin color rule is dumb as hell
1,3there's fun here? >.>
13actually... i overthought that... merely 16x16 for 256 colors
Thanks. I guess it's better than sitting idly and waiting for 6 hours.
I can understand not using it as the FG color but not being able to use it as the BG?
13but again, you can remove 16 at a time for things like yellow background or white background
indeed
1,3any yellow, black, or white background
13well, for some a black background is necessary, like dcd
13light green is hell on white background
also, take out black, white, and all 4 admin colors before you ever start
08,14. . .
hiya VioletVanilla
13hi vivi we're playing with paint :P
Ohai VioletVanilla :):)

You're not the only one
German is nice

well.... duh
08,14Midnight_Tempest <3
I mess up the tenses a lot though cos my teacher was a retard
I love German and Japanese
Lol Dumori.
/me is going to learn german~
it's true
ViVi <3
1,3i leik poniz
Yay Nyria :D
German is hard to me :'(
08,14きみがだいすきですよ～
But it is great
Unfortunatly, they are showing the most over-hyped game to ever exist...
german is easy but japanes omg !
=w=
/me is sad that she will never be able to know them
technically Japanese is my second toung
^
but I forgot most of it now
teach me sensei!
I learnt it aged 5
ive been trying to learn german on my own, but i need an actual course to teach me more
It's just the auto stream, nobody is really streaming at the moment
08,14Yellowquiet: OBJECTION! My brother mastered the Japanese language in under 2 years und lives there now!
/me has enough problems learning her first language :\
could say the same thing about mlp though *runs*
Japanese isn't massively complex in day to day use
You better run!
Im Russian and Estonian,and other laungages are hard to me,but i try to leart they
what? the most overhyped game ever is clearly Marvel vs capcom 3
1,3Eye gud speekin engrish
/me can speak it well but fuck if she has issues with spelling
I mean I'm illiterate in it atm but I could fix that
VioletVanilla your brother is op ;D
though my penmanship in latin is crap learnign to write a new alphabet will be fun
/me tried to learn spanish.
CoD is vastly over-hyped. If you even say "CoD" or "Call of Duty" 99.9999999% of the gaming community collectively jizzes in its pants...
are you good %kirzstryfe ?
Yellowquiet my mate spent a year learnign then a year living there for uni
/me giggles
i used to know french, but spending 18 years not speaking it you tend to forget stuff like that
/me felt bad when some of her class mates started having dreams in spanish and she was still having issues with simple words
I also tried to learn spanish, but I didn't take it too seriously and eventually gave up
I'm learning "German" that's way to arcaic for it's own good
1,3aye, grate mi twodae am
silly 1400-1600 texts
Pony dreams in spanish~ Sounds legit~
08,14Anyhow. . . Enough languages, rules say to keep it at a minimum. . . Though there are other language rooms if you wish to go in them
Seriously, VioletVanilla? o.o what rooms
08,14My brother used to talk in his sleep, und talked in all the languages he knows. . .

My adapter either stops working(indicator light goes solid)
1,3probably
Yeah, the heat makes the internet go faster, do it
He is~
OR it just powers down
1,3which would explain why it doesn't work right
otakon1 is pained in the buttocks.
I don't mind the single-player campaign of CoD, but after CoD 4, multiplayer has been horrid on that game
no
THE SIGNAL is FINE
/me 13snuggles with vivi und watches otakon go~
maybe it's because of the solar storm
/me snuggles with Shizuka~
13hehe <3
my USB WIFI ADAPTER is crapping out for SOME reason and I don't know WHY!
it sounds like a frimware issue

why not?
cause then u have everything on 100
Lol.
Mods are the streamers.

it's such an odd number
DCD is the fan of Megaman right?
no it's notg
it's divisable by 9
ah, i see
still not normal
strange number but there is nothing wrong with it
Start at level 1 go to level 81

no
for his arts
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-thats-one-way-to-go-about-it.gif
Simon chose Epic Movie
/me Hmmm
he's been in a few drawfriends
/me hugs DerpyVanilla "Cant wait for your stream"
It works
we are the herd, assimilation is necessary
/me is sore and covered in mud
08,14Simon painted a target on his head
Grrr...
epic movie was supposed to be a joke
Thanks guys 8D
I could think of other things to use with my hands.......
I hate Epic Movie, SO MUCH
now we have to watch it
......writing letters!
but Epic Movie sounds epic
*sips tea*
it has epic in the name
:P
08,14MidgetBrony ): Are you alright?
I watched it when I was 13, and I loved it!
ive seen it 3 times
i still like date movie better

Why does the female armor have boob bulges?
but hen you'll mis ponies if you do
umm

they did IRL MidnightBolt
Hey Sup

no they didn't...
08,14ohmy~ MidgetBrony~
pfft humans
Ok, I know what I'm going to do. My name is Pyroshy!
what's the Skyrim livestream~~ guy doing?
talking to npc's without stealing their whole inventory in an unusual approach for me
It would only help redirect strikes to the neck
is
Oh Lydia, Oh Lydia, oh have you seen Lydia, LYDIA THE TATOOED LADY!
they did! it said on QI i believe
I heard that isn't the best way to make armor
3Hey I do have to say that Simon is an awesome guy for choosing Epic Movie. Personally, even if the movie sucks, I think that he chose a movie that allowed us to have so much fun in making fun of it.
That is not good at all
uhhh...midnightbolt...because women have boobs?
uuh :3 my lasagna is ready
^
It isn't funny Slurry :(
click
So excuse me and let me get this tick off my arm
it kinda is
Kimiko: Bing~ you there?~
It's not so bad it's good
SlurryMoon: no one ever talks about my epic pony choice
It's just...awful

08,14mich~
EspyLacopa: its skyrim
maybe 150 people complaining about the movie will have some entertainment value
If a female wore armor they would just bind their boobs
MidnightBolt: that doesnt remove them
nor can it be comfortable
08,14^
plus I heard that isn't the best way to make armor
Hey, with skill affects fire weapons in New Vegas?

Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Vampires Suck, all these movies are awful in ways I can't fully express with words.
It makes no sense to have armor angles that make it easier to get stabbed in the neck
Cause they're parodies?
vampires suck was funny
something good about them though
and so was date movie
mfw...Bad movies making fun of bad movies...
you singing odelally from Disney's Robin Hood?
the rest sucked
ooooh, nice
very light linework
minimal shading
meh: no. no they were not.
does he have a tumblr?
ok that is THE MOST FUCKED UP thing I have ever heard. This woman has been EATING her dead husband's ashess for 2 months
MidnightBolt: if theyre going for your neck, boobs arent going to make it all the more likely
08,14emangamer: I heard about that a while ago. .
Oh cool story emangamer~
1,3don't think so
DerpyVanilla: seriously....just what?
/me doesn't even try~
Yes it will
Vampires Suck was literally nothing but the script writer copying and pasting every single tired, boring, groan inducing Twilight joke they could find on the internet.
What a story Emangamer :D
1,3most of the stuff he can show goes up on DA, but he works as a graphic artist, so a lot of it he can't share
08,14Alright. . .
aw, blast.
Hmm
"Fuck you Soldfur, I am heading off to get something!"
RAWRity: i know it was stupid but it still had me rolling

Okay so here is another question , How do you call out someone in italic bold? The thing that makes a sound?
"Man, the Old guy is FAST"
08,14type their name sweetie (

Pretty much just carbon and bits of finely ground bone? Kind of understandable in a slightly derranged way: he'll be a part of her. Not as if she were carving steaks of his corpse.
and now, Seltzer and Friedberg had ANOTHER movie coming out this year, entitled "The Biggest Movie of All Time 3D"
I LOVE you DerpyVanilla >:D
See, smashing things is always the solution.
