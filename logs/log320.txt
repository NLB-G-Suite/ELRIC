Something isn't right here.
I wanted to be a mod at one point but then realised i am too lazy!

I honestly have no idea how long I've been up
/me has had a great idea for a pony vid but has no vid editing software to make it happen
/me has had it sence she first watched Stare Master
I think 21 hours with 4 hours sleep then 28 hours on 5 then 52 on 4
it's all a blur of illness and insonia
/me laughs at Fleur for her lack of vid editing software
^
when he is
Fleur, you can pm me :3
I won't steal it :3
hmm...
/me locks Fleur in a magic proof safe
ok then, but you have to promise to not repeat it
Looks like the wii version?
Pinkie Pie promise Fleur
o.o
I swear on my oranges.
say it :P

I'm back
no mention of that fanfic please

He never left

Hmm,
Here comes the spam, doo doo doo doo
Thought he did
dun dun DUUUN
yo everypony
nice whoever did draw that
hmmm....
eloo
All fantasy designs are from Skyrim or FF. No expections.
Fnar fnar.
no
I'll see yous mooks later.
Later
here's my gallery :D http://www.ponychan.net/chan/art/res/91728.html
Err... lurk, lurk, lurk
hmmm...
Hmm, I have mixed feelings about that guys choich of weapon for fluttershy.
but my opinion on Fluttershy is that she should be like a summoner :p
aww shit
got to go guys
see ya
Later
toodles
the passive types are confusing for a setting that involves fighting
yeah
it's a odd playlist
and this is NiGHTS
spike doesnt reallys eem like a dagger user, more of a longsword or broadsword
/me can't see the stream D:
yeah
11,14I never played it, trippy
neither have I
perhaps, but, when it comes to battle, a dagger can be just as dangerous as a sword
he has natural weapons - claws; breath, etc
yeah
I suppose Rarity could fit the whip thing, but seems fluttershy took that though
his scales and claws aren't that tough yet
ummm
doesn't really work that way I think
fluttershy seems fine with a whip, rarity, being a unicorn could probably use magic and a shield
no proof that it doesn't yet
Whoa, weird.
and then even failing, that it effectively turns his breath weapon into a FFVII Summoning Materia
and Twilight isn't?
well
hmmm
as far as we know
wait...are we playing nights or mw?
it keeps flipping
it's a playlist
it's on a playlist loop
yeah
you are literally being burned to ashes, but reassembled at the destination
11,14livestream is on autopilot
extremely painful
<-- livestream is still buffering for me.
She has telekinesis, she could just keep hitting someone over and over again with a book.
the most painful way to travel
Fun is over at #bronystate, Asome
damn got disconnected
damn got disconected
but we've seen she can't use it to really grab and hold things
or at least not smack things with it
perhaps a darker background color would help
oh smack things, yeah probably
otakon...are we gonna have to debate again for an hour?
probably

/me facehoofs
*fleur missed the joke*
...?
lol
eyup
i imagine it was intentional...you know....friendship is magic?
I saw no joke...
please explain it?
we noticed
/me huggles all the Mods
It's like, hate is the opposite of friendshi
hello
and the lines were "dont hate me"
HAY
there we go
yeah... musical tourettes kicked in there
/me facehoofs again
i give up
closest to the signal
no more grounding out now
oh chill fleur, it was 3 letters
hay fries, extra crispy
i've seen people and mods alike use more than that before
Just did the BMN Survey. Totally forgot about it :$
it's in the newsletter
11,14survey links are 1 time use, sent out in the newsletter
ahh, didnt know that
yep
there we go
sign up for the newsletter
i wasnt talking to you on that one fleur
ther are
now, can someone tell me wth we were talking about? something to do with song lyrics that I didnt see posted?
11,14yeah, working on it
^
the stream is not interesting
gonna play some Jedi Knight II now. BRB
May the Force be with you
amen

11,3 yeah, it's still hard to read
ugh
0,5I can see it fine
not really
I can see it wonderfully
why not?
5,3 Luna's color
and that works good actually
13mod recolors
yeah
reverse?
0,5x3
blue*
/me facehoofs
mods cant even share colors slightly?
mods can
just not with Admins
DWARF FORTRESS
why not just go with a text color and not a background color?
because they are all taken
basically
all singular text colors are taken?
basically
how is that possible?
1,3singular colors cut out a lot of combinations that would use that color
GODDAMNITdaribot!
either that or they are just reeeeeeallly hard to read without a bg
no, you can
they are just both taken
wait wait wait.
re
maybe I spend too much time here
13ingwaz there are only sixteen colors
^
and apparently, some are off limits. even as a bg color.
/me thinks that is dumb
1,3lol, it can be
1,3and there are a lot of combinations that are out because they don't combine well
8,11 like this one
13such as either straight blue
1,3that's the point lol
?
13http://screensnapr.com/v/SNEbbx.png
dat Rayman
Back~
13dark blue is nigh invisible
I know, the stream is weird sometimes, it's on auto now
1,3then you have the combinations that are very close to other mods' colors
seems like a very limiting system
Ahh, ok. That explains it. Sorry, it's my first time here.
/me must have great eyesight
considering that to log in as yourself, you must know the password
Lol at user has ragequitted
I would advise you to click the #bronystate in the left bottom corner, that's where the fun is at
1316 colors, take 2, order matters... that's 16 nPr 2, that's 16!/(16-2)!
13there are 240 possible colors period
13then you start removing failed combos
13eeyup
I think "is" XD
1,3there's fun here? >.>
13actually... i overthought that... merely 16x16 for 256 colors
I can understand not using it as the FG color but not being able to use it as the BG?
08,14. . .
that is 6 colors you cant use right off the bat
1,3plus those mods that use multiple colors :3

08,14I would know. . .
08,14x.x
08,14:DD
08,14Sumica <3
