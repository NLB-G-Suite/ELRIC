And now L4D2 as a radio drama

goodnight everypony

I have to be the bearer of bad news guys, but unless Val's bandwidth inproves, we ain't watchin' L4D2

The color barrier

/me never goes down, except for when I do
How fast is mach 10?
Mach 10 is RD's calculated top spee
faster than mach 5, which mach 10 doesn't eve nexist
Yes, but how many mph?
A lot
10 machs an hour :P
lets' say 10x faster than the speed of light
Shouldnt RD disintegrate from that?
it's impossible to go 1.00000000001x the speed of light
Mach 10 exists, it's a calculated numerical speed
i mean mach 1
13mein team...
She shouldnt be alive after that
11,01F12 = Mach 1.
wow lol

Why'd you link that Cherilee fic that's not finished? WHY?
Yeah
11,01K.
Now I have ANOTHER fic I have to watch out for!
gtg everyone
I even clicked the music links for it
Maybe I need to start reading some FiM fanfics...
11,01Yeah.
I haven't done that for anything before!
later
hold on, i think I have a good starting fic
but it's a GREAT fic!
I have read some of the more disturbing fics
it's over
Reading? You people make me sick...
I dont even read creepypasta!
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-sunny-skies-all-day-long.html <-- this is a simple fic, about a half hour read, that's basically an episode
but it's GREAT!
Pfft, that's nothing
very long
its tl;dr for alot of readers
man, the videos lagging alot here
I said ONE nove
ONE
not a TRILOGY
Well I'm gonna go bye everyone
each one is about one million words
Well, publishers always break up books for that reaoson.
Fleur for good reasons.
well, and profitable reasons
but I'm sure "the book is too big" is a good reason too
Someone startled the witch...
stupid mips.tv
i keep accidentaly closing the stream
I would buy it
yeah
I think the dictionary has more than 2000 pages
that's why I'm trying to get my e-reader to work right
I wouldn't be surprised
whats the page count of wikipedia?
A dictionary serves a speciifc purpose, you don't read it for hours.
linky-pages or printed pages?
dont answer, I dont know either way
Whats the longest fanfic on ff.net?
The OED is 13 books
....wow
I just dont have very much patience
point in case, FO:E is long. FO:E-PH might end up being longer (not sure page count wise, but the "halfway point" was 33 supposedly)
"So the smoker" *shades "got smoked."
*sigh*
:$
I can think of one novel that's 1000 pages long, and it's not a very well regarded Novel...
that needs to be made
No, wait, three.
.. I could see it... I think the notes were *slightly* off from the text, but I might be wrong
Zombies are mean, i mean seriously

okay
fine
there ARE longer ones out there
Hold on, laundry calling
hai all
how everyone doing
I'm sorry, I'm taking this too seriously.. Anyway, a 2,000 page story needs to be published in 4 parts out of practicality, after its success, it could be published ina single bound book because they know it has fans
"Application provided invalid, non monotonically increasing dts to muxer in stream 1:" <RAGE\>
mmmmmm, hammm
That's literally how LotR was published, Tolkein wrote one manuscript, then the publisher broke it up into three books.
/me hugs Fleur

Hi
I liked Rainbow Factory. As it was written, any way. Not the plot, really.
I've read about half of Rainbow Factory.
In my eyes, thats just as bad as the Fiction we can't talk about.
The writing is very good. I just.. was afraid to go further.
hey guys :)
MLD should be an example for good fanfic
I feel bad now
:'(
My fiction is interesting.
Nnnope
I don't like sad endings. Relatively speaking, anyway.
We are losing D:
MLD has like, 6 endings from fans.. Lol
Yep.
I still support you! :)
I don't like majority of other stories endings.
The one I do like is about the fiction we can't talk about.
Yes.
Plus the Phil Caullins song tribute with it that makes me tear up.
Yea*
:'(
Eeyup.com
Manly tears... they have been shed.
^Bestwebsiteever.
Go to that website..
/me also isn't a father, but really left me with an empty feeling.

Sound weird?
Quite a bit.

10,02She said, "The two kids want you to take them Bowling on Saturday, then afterwards they want you to take them to the cinema."
10,02"It's either one or the other," I said, "otherwise it's too expensive."
10,02"Okay," she replied. "Which one do you prefer?"
Someone should stream it
10,02I said, "David."

Lemme pull up my Fimfiction account
congrats
I'd rather it be centrally about her. You can do anythint with Dash, to be honest.
anything, rather.
:D
wait, wait. Are you asking for ideas about writing one?
No.
I thought you wanted a link to a story about her?
10,02"Well, I can't complain."
I've got that under control.
I want a story to read.
=P
05^ lol'd

HAH
Um, first off: Shipping bother you?
05hia guise
A bit. It depends.
10,02How school works:
10,02Homework: 2+4+2=8.
Not fond of Cloppyness.
I'm having issues enough with my fiction, man. Plus a super-secret movie thing coming that I can't talk about
lol
:D
Nothing like that >_<
Gotcha.
10,02Ohai :3
Yea, Shipping is OK..
10,02:O
05teach me the whole course from ground up

10,02What's 2+2=?
oops caps* sorry
1,35
055
05ohsitÂ¨
10,02It's okay, this is a learning opportunity
dat ohsit
When, based on the newest episode, she's not.
the answer is 42
10,02Hint, it's less than 5 but greater than 3
I don't mind it if it's pulled off well..
1,32+2=5 for very large quantities of 2
10,02O___O
1,3*2+2
If you can make it realistic, go for it.

I don't mind shipping if it goes from the character being themself to them getting to that point.
1,3my glomps :p
05the area between 2 curves, in the section of 5S10 when the following function is 3x dx
it's fine
agreed.
he always does
/me tackle-glomps the glomp
I don't like it when the character is different from canon, which, in my first chapter, Dash is. However, I'm planning on letting her come out a bit more for a while.
Well, you also have the "willing suspension of disbelief" going.
You have Dash before we see her in the show.
Exactly.
/me curls into a ball in the corner and yawns
10,02Wrek: I can help you with that, but Section of 5S10?
1,3to hug you when you start to bitch too much? ^_^
ouch kirz...just ouch
Right.
05its the interval
hi
=(
05mhm
10,02What's the second curve function?
hi all
No more math!
no math, yes meth!
Math is Magic
05iirc it was along the lines of 2xcos4
/me cowers in fear
10,02Well, first you need to graph the two together to see which is higher than the other.
Not enough sand.
Perhaps I can help?
=/
10,02Then whichever is higher, you solve the integral of both from 5 to 10 and subtract the lower integral answer from the higher integral answer.
We could pop open, in the words of the 4chanistas...
this... this must be... CALCULUS!!! *explodes*
05is ee
what's calculus?
Terror
<.>
10,02Yeah?
Honestly, between school, military, work, helping on another project, and it, it just isn't seeing the time it needs.
calculus is EXTREMELY advanced math
:P
10,02Calculus is the math of change.
what's uncouth?
05how the fuck do i take out the f`` of f(x)=4x -cos^2
Military?
o.o
8,1Midnight_Tempest: can't tell if joking or not
lol
10,02You take the derivative of the derivative.
I'm a Cadet.
05righto
1,3can you do that?
It puts the deviation on its skin..
lol Saturn, unintentional joke
1,3can you derivitate twice?
8,1Wrek: easy, just take the two terms seperately and apply chain rule to the latter
8,1then do it again
10,02Yup, the second derivative of 4x becomes 0.
DUN DUN DUNNN
i dont wanna learn... not yet

10,02Biomedical Engineering
8,1aye
8,1that's basically biology, but with *useful* maths, right?
05we just call it math D
seems much more simplier
05et
05c
05which is the highest available language course
10,02It's basically the combination of a background in engineering techniques while specializing in biological applications.
nanomachines
10,02^
05anyways
05i begin in 50 minutes
10,02Tissue engineering is an excellent aspect of a bioengineer.
05then i have math for 20 minutes
0530*
05then I can go home
05cause i have no morel essons for the day :D
10,02Yup, break up the function to be -[cos(x) * cos(x)]
school is nothing like Glee... stupid effing show
lol
^
05sin/cos/sin/cos
10,02Product rule is f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x)
05they jsut switch dont they?
Why can't Ponies tutor us and help us in school?!

Goodnight Nittany
8,1(f * g)` = f` * g + g` * f <-- product rule
8,1iirc
10,02What I said silly :3
05whats g?
8,1i meant to type that in like 3 minutes ago
8,1but i had to blow my nose
05i think we're using a different symbol for that but hmm
10,02Basically: if h(x)=f(g(x)) then h'(x) = f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x)
10,02O U
8,1all that means is that if you take the derivative of the product of two functions, you can apply that rule
8,1i really don't understand this: do people *honestly* find trig hard?
8,1like, seriously?
05i have to translate the terms they use, and guess where they go
anyone wanna let me draw the humanized version of this scene? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdsEjfCbzk
Ive never been to trig
never found trig hard, school didnt go past right angle triangles though
8,1Placebo: i think trig is fun...
10,02Trig identities are the WORST thing ever in math.
-Pinkie Pie

8,1hey now, graphing is important
this didnt make any sense to me...
05nothign changes
10,02okay :3
i havent been in school for a decade... i dont remember anything anymore
05current problem is chemistry
05now that i also failed

Is chemistry hard?
05so without it
05im fucked
10,02What are you going to do then?
High school
05take the comp next month and pray
05(to satan)
10,02Which you need my help to study, right?
05mhmmm
8,1i'm ashamed to say that i know little chemistry and hardly any biology
05there are only 3 more comp opportunities this term
10,02Organic Chemistry: Synthesis and Mechanisms is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken.
8,1i studied chemistry to Standard Grade (equivalent of GCSE) at school
05and its my last term of 12th grade
8,1but didn't do any biology

Do you think a unicorn could use a cane? Like as an actual way to support themselves as they walk?

I was pondering it, yet I can't feel completely sure about it.
But..

Livestream > bodily functions
/me hugs everyone <3
/me calls dibs on #BronyState
goodnight!
I think bodily functioms are more imortant than stream
8,1i.e. the stream is a lot smoother in my recording than it is to actually watch
LOL
no kiddin
/me waves his cane around to get attention
Saturn: yeah, noticed that. but compiz is cool
8,1aye
hey Davie
8,1i use it instead of xfwm
8,1it look preeetty
I am thinking about my ponysona having a cane, yet I am not completely sure that a unicorn could use a cane as it was intended.
Mmagic
05btw my goal atm it to reach the level acme station
05mainly becasue that level is very atmospheric
NIIIIGHT!
I doubt I'm going to make it that far in T_T
Of course. It's magic.

Well.. I guess it'd be telepathy in reverse.
isnt telepaty implicitly two way?
No
In reverse, you would lift yourself using another point as a focal point.
thats telekenesis
^
Right, thanks.
Walk through walls?
lOl
She made herself fly
using the ground as a focal point.
in fo:e self levitation takes alot of effort for some reason

05you could call it doom 3
owwwww

i just played standard Doom..... MAAAANY TIMES

Hey Shy
Hmm.. No one said Planet
therefore it was a bad idea
If only Saturn/Planet6 would be here
yes?
okay
Well that's wrong apparently
but thats just whats in my head, my silly silly head
It's an alien
Gaia is an alien
Anyone?
...Anyone?
no idea
FFIX?
I just call it as something earth element related
/me sighs.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_%28mythology%29 allso my 'planet spirit' guess wasnt far wrong
lol
Why does no body read Asimov?
read suks
*reading
:d
That would help.
Did it work?
Yes, It did.
Good
For a moment there I was afraid I did the lastt bit off. Could have accidentally sent Penguins into extinction if i get the last bit right
wrong*
IF you guys have an account in SL, come to Trotsdale.
SL?
It probably is because it drove on, but that's probably because that's a more sensical way how my mind would've explained the sudden silence.
Ya, thats where the alien RPs as fluttershy
oh
Oh by the way, you also killed all natural penguins in a hundred mile radius...
= 0 >__>'
No I didnt
That's a blessing
Eenope
I remember the first one, it was ok
The first was pretty good i think... Second? ClichÃ©d but not ALL bad
1st one is amusing. 2nd is... average
in terms of talking animals kind of ok
Anyway, the reason why the alien doesn't talk to humans is all the other attemps to talk to them has lead to the government capturing members of her species.
05would you ratehr have me play something else or do something else entirely?
/me would, but /me is /me
i'm in and of myself a minority
i got the fluttershy rp bit but that sentence was just lolwut

you can't compare a Single play rpg to a mmorpg
*facehoof*
it's like comparing fluttershy with pinkie pie, right?
it depends on how the MMORPG is designed
ow damn i fail that sentence
if the MMO is largely single-player with social aspects, that's one thing
oooo
:O!
but half the time no one is social
owww

children you can't, and essential NPCs
my uncle's partner did that
if you go with the imperial on the beginning you dont need to steel from the smith
and there's a mod that lets you kill children
the blacksmith bumped into him,and his partner cut off his head
loll
05easy cash

Intrecate and perfectly balanced to work away without stopping.
no

Where-a be yo Kamma-junk!?
then with a rubber band on the blade?
oooooowwwwwwwww
/me pouts and walks off
first times yes.....
but it was like........
uhhhhh......
OMG
*ahem* gentlemen?
10 years ago
:O
you silly..................... the world IS a clock :D!
The clock would still function without them being there.
If they wouldn't be there, it wouldn't have reached the exact point it did
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TcddoSCB8I
it would be a diffrent point entriely
You can say that the Earth would work perfectly without humans no?
But there would be a lot of things very different
it wouldnt
a lot of speices would still exists.. a lot of species would NOT exists
Animals existing and going exstinct is part of the function
I'm talking about changing the rules.
Indee
As in actually making the orbit of the planet change to extend summer.
you can' take out a cog and put in a smaller one
that is not much different than making a species extinct
it LOOKS bigger
but in an infinite universe its not bigger at all
now both of ya,shut up!
Nuuuu
/me dramaticly falls in slowmo from the traut slap
/me cant beleive that worked
You mean 'filly'sophical
/me laughs at davie falling slowly
/me walks away
The point I was getting to is the reason why the ponies have to change the seasons, raise the sun and moon and guide the birds is because they broke the world.
/me puts on his razerback
There are still parts that function normally, however those are isolated and are exceptoins
Because ponies live in a world where everything depends on eachother to survive.
I think they don't HAVE to, they just developed an economy that needs the seasons to be perfectly orderly
In my opinion only Equstria works like this
thats it
and not becasue it can't do other wise, but because they need it like that
/me pulls out huntsman and aims at davie
/me pulls out his flamethrower
/me cloaks
HEY!

Because I literally didn't know which of the two you were going for.
Yes. Most males in shows animation are voiced by females, yes.
