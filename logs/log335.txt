@Chance there will be a streammeter

So, how about them Poni?
. . .This isn't working.
@pokemon

FUS TO RAH:[

I remember Veerez
well im off to play some skyrim
Dken2021: he typically leaves after working his moustache hard
At least I ended with Regigigas!!!
bleh. wrek's naps are more like hibernation
Veerez was fun
He'd quote things in the Twilight Sparkle room
he's offline though :(
I hate when people flood google with stuff that isn't even relevent to what you're searching for. -___-
(now If can at least find Black/White)

Worst video ever made//
Today has been an awesome day! I sang pony songs on the bus!

Scoot-Scootaloo, what songs?

All of Season 1!
Awesomeee!!
Its amazing that I even know all of the lyrics!
wth was that?
I was singing 'Flim Flam Brothers/Super speedy Cider Squeezy 6000" aaaalllll dayyyyy....
still no stream, I see
eeyup
By the time I sang "So many Wonders", the bus was packed!
You can't imagine what everyone's faces were like XD
It was a glitchfest and nothing was Supereffective against Psychic Types
MisingNO is Incredibly interesting, heres some documentation about it http://derpy.me/KPqfi (websites down :( so thats wayback machine)
Lol!! Nice xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq8Ibf5eQ58 and now for something ADORABLE /)^3^(\
I only know the lyrics to 'At the Gala' from season 1 :(
and since everypony has had enough time to get this song out of their heads
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAD7K3MQX0M
enjoy
if I did that around my high school bus, not only I would get weird faces, I probably get beat up for it
Thanks StinkomanFan, i was planning to get diabetes -_-
d'aww kitties
Wanna join the Kuddly Kittens Klub? :)
Nah, its the Kool Kids Klub!

/me comes bearing gifts of ham and moar ham
F.E.A.R. 3? Alrighty then!
ooh, good game
anypony ever play mount and blade
"GOD FORMIDABLE PEOPLE PRAYER MINISTRYSOUTH PRAGUE,MOSCOW,RUSSIA." spam is so much fun
Alright everypony, try to be not stupid
2,14 I have Mount and Blade (not installed)
/me noms on gifted ham
O_O A stream, finally
...ok, i know this isn't Portal, so what is this?
ValtheJean: I would LOVE to see that in action! I've heard good things
ham? Unless this is Fallout equestria , i ain't touching have ham and nor should you
Oh my god, I keep forgetting iI have this tab open.
MirrorImage: it's F3AR
2,14 it's a good game
Mount and blade was a quality game!
2,14 but I need to install it
I heard steam go off.
I remember playing the beta
I haven't played it
2,14 that, and Vampire Masquerade
I have not the funds
Mutterguy ham hater
How would the mane 6 react to three meat pizza?
ValtheJean: OOH! VM, play VM!
11,01I have tons of steam games, with a fraction of them installed.
Great game!
Everytime I stay in manechat I feel my brain is being insulted
Terribly Kira
I figured as much
hmmmm, /me has to test something
I just assumed ponies are supposed to be vegetarian
Holy man, I have 19 steam games.
So, how is everypony this FINE evening?
Mutterguy its doesn't come from an animal, it comes from my magical ham mane
They might be lacto-vegetarians, they have moo-cows
Dismo - if you're referring to Fallout Equestria, remember that it's set about 200 years later from present Equestria
*sigh* ads
dat music :|
DAT EAR-RAPE
ok, i guess that morks althouhgh meat is still bad for ponies
0,5Skatabelepodiapelapelapelapelapedalado
mein ears!
MirrorImage: Huh?
Sooo... what are we playing?
*works
F3AR
0,5Y SB LEEVE US
That's nice Celestia
because he has school?
Fear? AWESOME.
I mean, Veganism takes on different meaning when you can actually have a coversation with the critters that produce your food...
darn you laggy stream!
conversation*
My little Alma : Fearship is Madjik
You don't think they'd tolorate the vsrity of human foods, even if they don't eat them?
prepare to shitbrix for anyone who hasn't played fear before.
A Hamless man cannot be trusted
Ive beat this game like 3 times
Never played before.
lol!! I love fear soo much
The ponies MUST have some sort of arrangement with the cows.
It's giving a psychic a gun defeating the purpose of him being psychic in the first place?
The hell is that?
...Oh mywhat.
ok, did that work?
dafaq?
wat da fuq!
Oh, my...
My friends go them fear in different orders so of course I had to play it with all of them
You guys don't think that the ponies would at least tolorate our varity of human foods, i.e. meats?
Randomnerd: yeah, they keep the cows fed and house them, and the cows provide milk.
will admit, I'm not scared of much but this game has made me jump and possibly scream many times.
And the entire aspect of a horror game entirely?
Kira_Pony_Yamato: doubt it, they'd get sick on it
I dont think so Kira
/me hugs Fleur
No, i mean tolorate the existence of said food, not nesscerly eat them
hi Cy!
Sorry, wasn't clear on that.
Kira_Pony_Yamato: sure, look at Owlowious
True
if however i was to move to equestria, i would be happy to change to a vegeterian diet
they KNOW he eats mice
The Gryphons must be Omnivorous.
dat ad on my screen...
So Mortee what are your thoughts on giving a horror hero a gun?
/me hugs Fleur again
Ingwaz: me too, salad wouldn't be bad with cheese and dressing only
this seems to be working
/me is Phase4
Then again, most brony headcanon assumes Gryphons and Ponies don't get along well.
lol, heard my own ding
and I LIKE a nice hearty veggie sooup
Phase4 why?
after all, pinkie is a glutton
I'm so alone :c
lol^
ponies have cake that they never get fat off of.
i'mokwiththis.
Gryphons eat horses in mythology
...
Randomnerd: well, it seems to me that it's not that they don't get along, it's that Gryphon's are fairly rare in Equestria on whole.
testing recording multiple channels at once
True, IshBestPony|HamMane
Maybe I need to catch up on my mythology..
yeah
Lol.. who's streaming..?
no... Dashie_Dashie, pinkie does say that if she eats too much cake then she gets a pudge and then she cant budge
ValtheJean:
Not much in a movie or game can make me Jump anymore, The only thing that can get me going is a creepy story or eerie Character , That's why I prefer oldie horror, Most of them have a better story then the shit theese days. Like the Shinining, That always beats the shit out of me.
and i'm sure there's some mistrust when you consider that equines are a primary food source for griffons in common mythology
i have 6 copies of lightirc on my screen, only three are working right now though
any more and the network yells ate me
at'
MirrorImage: maybe, but it looks like Griffons can eat veggies and fruit as well
Who ever is streaming is having alot of fun with the slide attack.
XD
oh certainly they can
that is a crazy looking shottie
Sp this is where everypony is
In MLP, they cannot eat Ponies, otherwise the Ponies would have to destroy gryphons on sight.
but if you lived on Steak for all your life and were suddenly told "no more steak. eat only salads..."
bai everypony
Bye, IshBestPony|HamMane
/me hugs and gives ham to Randomnerd
byw ish
GRAB MY SHOTTIE LIKE JOHN GOTTIE! Hell yeah! FUCK YOUR COUCH!*as my friend used to say*
*bye
/me noms ham
/me and SkilledSkillet
bye IshBestPony|HamMane see you later
Yes!
/me and otakon
noooo D:
Ok, I came back
angwy pwotting woona is adowable woona
Gryphons must eat meat, but can't eat Ponies, otherwise Gilda wouldn't have been permitted to attend Junior Flyers camp.
Awww, cute pic
I hope you all have stopped being silly
/me leaves ham foar everypony
Command "Disregard locals" Me: "I hope you die a horrbile, painful death, you assmuncher."
that picture made me Dawww
/me the ham haz been instructed to give hugz as you nom it
Of course I miss the picture
11,01Fthreeear is suddenly CoD.
lol
:o
Not very scary is it?
Lol indeed
Lol he's having to much fun with the dash attack.
Would Luna not have been born with her cutie mark?
Yes
Probably.
11,01I played Fear 1, but I didn't stay interested enough in it to finish it.
yeah
me too
It is likely even Alicorns have to get them.
my GOD it felt so boring at times
Stop being so damned UNSCARY game!
If someone told me to disregard locals and even shoot them, I'd help my 'target'
Dismo: not sure tbh
Oh game you so silly!
Kira_Pony_Yamato: that makes you a bad soldier then, but a good human being
Giving the hero of a horror game a gun kind of defeats the whole: terrified of everything
I'd rather be a bad soldier, if it meant being a good human being.
FFFFFUUUUUUU No cover
Hide behind a burning car GENIOUS
Seems legit
11,01I know.
StinkomanFan: It's entirely possible to be afraid while holding a gun
Alright I got a magic 8 ball, ask me any yes or no questions
Hey so I have a pony question
Who is Shining Armor?
Is Luna coming back for more eps
?
Yes
Will I sing tommorow Stinkomanfan?
#bronystate << better place to ask, or you could check the mlp wiki
Yaaaay!
Most likely
Will humans ever go to equestria?
I knew it!
Why would they not use her again? lol
No :c
D:
:'(
Will hipster ever stop being hipsters?
It;s cole macgrath!
Yes
what the hell?
StinkomanFan: Will there be atleast 4 seasons and a movie of FIM?
&
i mrrn ^
suddenly LIGHTNING MAN!?
meen'
herp derp
Yes Dismo
I would love it if there was a MLP movie.
SkilledSkillet: :I I'm playing that game right now tbh.
Me too
Me Three.
rave - be MUCH more specific about that
Im proud of you Dismo
I'd love a MLP movie as well
there are MLP movies, but they're G1
Well, I just BEAT 1 and I'm downloading 2, then FOB.
Next question!
Eww, G1...
Will I ever find true happiness Stinkomanfan?
I believe so.
ok, mips.tv is the best to test it on due to its slow
in the mean time, i'm going back to Fallout NV
Outlook good
Yay!
Lol! mlp fim movie then xD
What are the odds that Cod will eventually die..
That's not a yes or no question
Kira_Pony_Yamato - i give it 3 more years before it does
dat reload whoring.
Someone pointed out that the actors in the MLP movie had over 30 awards between them.
MirrorImage: Who's yourfavorite companion?
Damn...
solo kthx
ED-E at most
ok, so i simpily cannot do more than 15fps on this machine with ffmpeg
that sucks
as i just about walk across the bridge at Primm distracted by this chat, forgetting there are 3 landmines...
thanks Dismo...
NEXT QUESTION
Red or Green?
Can Nothing Stop the Smooze?
Yes or no question
Does the chat work on Andriod cell phones, by chnce?
red, green wasnt releasd in english
MirrorImage: c: Thats why you get the perk silly.
released'
Dismo - at level 3?
Yes Randomnerd
MirrorImage: PC ps3 Or 360. And No, D:
Bow Bow Bow Bow BOw BOw
PC, obv
Does Bronystate chat work on Andriod cell phnoes?
Will I ragequit a game tommorow Stinkomanfan?
We should do a Tomb Raider night! :D
Yes Skillet
Awwwwww
Kira_Pony_Yamato - Bronystate chat is flash based, so if your Android can run flash, it should
This isn't working.
otherwise, it's standard IRC, so an Android IRC client could get you in
Awesome!!
Next question
That was a friendly steam chat
I can only seem to run a few select pc games, LIke WoW and Any of the older GTA games. Saints row and Sonic Genarations are slow, If anyone has steam or PSN. :I I would love more friends on either.
I have steam Dismo
Next pony question?
11,01Steam: KCE_Killer_Kyle. PSN: Nittany_Tiger
guys Val's second computer died
I have steam :o
Eeeew.
Forsooth! Thou art a yeasty fly-bitten jack-a-nape!
i'
woops
Nay
StinkomanFan: Will there be a 2nd Back to the future game for PS, Wii?
just letting you all know thats why Val vanished
I'd have steam if this computer wasn't crap.
and could play valve games.
Yes Dismo
Dem freaks.
SkilledSkillet: My user name, I think is Dismo217
GNIGHT ALL
I love this MLP calendar :D
/me waves
Woah, the hell was that?
Bye, Dermathil
Bye Dermathil! Take care!
Rainbow Dash Rawket
later Dermathil
Bye Dermathil
Rainbow Dash's rainboom was Rainbow colored.
There wasn't a missile alarm...
Not Red.
/me waves and walks out.
Randomnerd, where you get it? :o
You missed the othe colors
It's the perfect way to count down the days to Bronycon.
I bought it at a CVS
:o
Oh look a mall in a horror game
How original
lol
Now I can say I've supported the show ;)
All dat wasted food.
I ever tell you guys how much I love my hat?
This year, I'll buy a ton of Toys and donate to Toys for Tots. :)
I have a Vinyl Scratch shirt and the RD 'This belt just got 20% cooler' belt :P
I sent the friend request Dismo
That's ridiclous, RaveBrony
But sadly im too damn small for the belt....
Why, RawketLawnchair? D:
I can haz belt :3
Toy gotta hid your power level, RaveBrony
You might be able to buy a belt kit and attach the buckle to that.
awh
/me hugs StinkomanFan
Wait, what?
OPEN DOOR
Ooigh.
lol fail
That doesn't look healthy.
the fear series really lost their scary components.
Its a shame they only have RD....id like the mane 6 belts.... But, my friends bought me those 2 mlp items, im not sure if id spend much money on such things
/me can't see through the ad
Oh boy ZOMBIES in a mall, truely we've reached the height of originality
not zombies.
ghots
Tandy leather sells belt kits. Alternatively, you could just punch a hole in the belt.
ghosts and paranormal stuff.
ghosts*
ZOMBIE GOASTS LEAVE THIS PLACE
whatcha playing?
Yeah, but have you seen the RD belt? Id want the others.... but what wud they say?
Fear
Oh the ladder broke, how scary
You cant just have 'yay' on the fluttershy belt :\ perhaps, 'Youre going to love me!"? lol
:[<This?
RaveBrony: You could punch a hole in the belt with a hammer, nail, and a brick it wouldn't be perfect, but you'd be able to fit your waist
I didnt know F3AR was multiplayer :o
Yes that stinkomanfan
I might have to get that now
/me loves multiplayer coop
so hows this look? http://youtu.be/a1LkR6dGWns
sugestions welcome
/me love multiplayer coop as well
But, its a seatbelt buckle belt :o
Yay! I'm on the vidya!
Not bad Phase4
Phase4: chat's a bit blurry for me, not sure if that's the rending though.
Dashie_Dashie: yeah, thinking of resizing it
looks fine in 480p
Thats good Phase4 :P
RaveBrony: Damn! It's too small, then?
other than that it's great :>
TV's don't scare me anymore
thats alot of tv's
aww, there all broken
Awwww so much tv wasted :'(
It's a department store, of course they have TV's
/me has to turn of the stream
Well, its not really too small, its just difficult to put on at the place i have it at x_x
But i have it hanging on my wall so you can read the words :P
He possessed some dolt in a trucker's costume
so no real sugestions about the video beyond text is a bit small?
nope
It looks fine Phase4
^
Open DOOR
ok, i'l record it like that for the next episode
:D
I don't see how Bullets would kill ghosts
Sweet
Da freezer ghost!
1. use bullet on ghost
2. ????
Haha!
3. PROFIT!
Dammit Alma.
^
oh look
Cast revive on ghost girl
Alma you so silly gurl
dual weilding
????
blargh
Profit!
But are those shirts and such licensed Hasbro Products?
what the HELL are those things?
Again, I don't think Silent Hill would be as scary if it was like this
ok. f3ar (which is a stupid name) imply's at least some horror, dual wielding automatic pistols is not a thing found in horror (i'm whining, not complaning)
I didn't know the INfected showed up in this?
What, Randomnerd? THe Vinyl Scratch?
Zombie ghosts!
Leave this place!
I already made that joke
the joke has been doubled?
lol^
True dat
Rule of three
We can only use it three times
im back
Then it stops being funny
ohai fillyfillyy
wb fillyfillyy
Use your last wisely
Hi filly
Wb, fillyfillyy
what game dey playin?
F3ar
Fear
fillyfillyy: http://youtu.be/a1LkR6dGWns sugestions?
thats what i thought
Well, any of the stuff, RaveBrony. I want Hasbro to look at their marketing data and realize our demographic is worth courting.
One does not simply slay prince dari, emantrollslayer.
gotta use the little colts room
brb
1 sec ill check that vid Phase4
/me refuses to slay the troll of all trolls, LadyCanary
I keep thinking that it's INfamous.
My friends got the belt and the shirt from Hot topic :P
0,5I LOVE inFAMOUS
GUYS, IJust installed a MLP theme on chrome
LordCelestia: IKR???
LadyCanary is no troll. She is a beautiful Canary <3
I dont know why but I started listening to particle man
They told me theyre getting me sooo much mlp stuff for my birthday in a couple of months xD

0,5Back in my RP days I had an OC named Bolt based off of Cole MacGrath :3c

We're not some freaky accident that abuses copyright laws, we're people that adore the show and have plenty of disposable income!
Same, I just beat the 1st one a few hours ago on good, Now I'm downlaoding 2 on PS3.

You know what I never understood in Red Dead Redemption how a throwing knife was more powerful than a revolver
How does THAT work?
LordCelestia: no one wants to listen to that shit
oops LordCelestia wrong video
>3 bodyshots with a revolver to kill
>one bodyshot with a throwing knife to kill
WTF?
So... Who's the glowy red guy?
http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132763256568.jpg
somepony broke a pinkie promise
It wasnt me
Pinkie Pie scared me before
NOW SHE MORTIFIES ME
StinkomanFan - don't break a Pinkie Promise and you'll be fine
. . .The hell?
... well that just happened
...INSANITY. That's wut
I just don't like how I can wake up and turn to see Pinkie Pie staring into my eyes from across my room
Just saying
those pinkie images can actualy get scary
And now that I know she can actually HARM me if she wanted does not help
HOLY SHIT...this is really legit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNgtIrSHack
StinkomanFan - that much was true when we learned that pinkie can break the 4th wall
if she can appear ANYWHERE, then she can appear within a body cavity
...
yeah... let those implications sink in
Wii U eh?
I'd rather not wake up one morning and see a pink hair in my mouth
possible new zelda game already? I hope it turns out better than - well nevermind, its best left forgotten
/me needs something to do
Try to pull it out and....FOREVER
wait, was that fan made?
2,14 so that was a connection death =/
hey LordCelestia http://www.houseofrave.com/media/bandages/bacon-bandaids-big2.jpg
Amnesia now? :3
Nice trailer
2,14 well, hope you all enjoyed F3AR, before it crashed
2,14 lol, you want Amnesia?
amneesiaaa
Why not
oh god....not amnesia
YES
AMNESIA
... it was fan made, checked the desription
otakon: there are a few other tryouts but honestly your the best
/me os no longer AFK
/me is no longer AFK**
yes! Amnesia :) I'll prep the lights
Dken2021: I know...but it still looks legit
Os?
amnesia reaction vids always make me smile
Now I own Amnesia, If somepony made a mod that turned the demons into Pinkie Pie...
2,14 well, Vi played amnesia before, and I'll have to start from the beginning
Oh dear...
/me is AFK again because he is a loser and cannot stay in bronystate chatroom right now :P
ok, this should be recording sound this time
Phase4: you truly think so?
thanks
I would just die crying in fear
Ohai ValtheJean <3
pinkie pie... amnesia demons... well, im not sleeping tonight :$
Are there pony voice mods for Amnesia? like in....that video?
"Come on! Let's Party!"
Oh god, I still suck at Gmod
"WHAT'S IN THE BOX?!"
0,5HOWD IT GET BURNED?
LordCelestia: no wicker man references...
2,14 eh, I think we're gonna do some mod L4D2
NO
1,3:)
Hrm...
0,5Oh many wicker man references
lolz
0,5Not the bees
Awesome, sound worked and it isnt affected by my volume
Turning the Demons into Nicholas Cage would be lulzworthy
0,5My eyes
0,5etc
LordCelestia: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v508/Jebdel/beeweapon.jpg
wicker man was a good movie... but not the nicolas cage one...
Get Amnesia u- ok :(
2,14 sorry, I'll stream Amnesia at another time
2,14 though for now, bleh
If I knew how to make mods, Id make a Nacny Pelosi mod for that creature in Amnesia :P Just one of many manic ideas I happen to have in mind :)
I love this intro
Breaking and entering
but it SUCKS Bill kicks the bucket
He was my fave from 1
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOslyBHQxUM&feature=context&context=G2962025FUAAAAAAACAA
"Nothing's missing, but someone left this lamp here!"
lol
2,14 spoilers :P
2,14 you're lucky I just played through that level
ah
sorry
ValtheJean: does that mean you get banned?
no
2,14 phfff, for a L4D spoiler? hardly
phew
What level? That was a Dane Cook joke
2,14 though it is TEMPTING >:D
ohhh i love this game
/me loves this game
I like the concept of this game
but I suck at it
ValtheJean: but spoilers are not allowed....
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Doctor Whoof would be ashamed :|
looks like therees been *glasses* a change of plans
you gonna do a single player run Val or get a team going?
change of plans? *puts on sun glasses*
you teacher's pet
so is this l4d?
2,14 If L4D had a decent story I'd agree eman, kekekekekee
ew
just ew
2,14 I've got two other mods joining me, and possibly a third
Why do people keep putting kekekekekeke? It annoys me
tentacle tounge
That smoker is the master of noms
2,14 if we don't I'll open it to the first person to pm me
ME!
:D
hey Phase4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV9NJqLNuI4
i got a mod for the Dark Carnival level that makes the end of it play MLP music instead of the Midnight Riders music
Just play a campain and allow people to enjoy
The CMC's song right?
*to join
StinkomanFan: that's the sound Cybamen make IIRC
emantrollslayer: lol
hey ValtheJean you wanna know what sucks?
nope, winter wrap up, the opening theme... songs like that
shut up edd XD
Phase4: it's funny because whenever he puts on his glasses dubstep plays
11,01End plays G3 music.
0,5Dumb but funny somehow http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLKtV_exjF4&feature=g-all-f&context=G2f3e42bFAAAAAAAAIAA

MOAR F5!!!
Oh F5 you so silly
I routed for the AFC in the pro-bowl game (routing, haven't seen all of it yet), partially because of the San Diego Chargers :)
Paritally because my friend, who is awesome and beautiful, :), likes the Ravens

Nittany_Discord: just came out of the closet :D <3
Pony_of_War: Which reminds me, its almost the super bowl

Qwepin!
yay two chat windows
yay 2 chat windows
Alright, the Mane six all have...scary charactoristics
CLOPPER!
Damn my slow internet
RD's sonic Rainboom can break the sound barrier... what else can it break?
The color barrier
also could achieve mach 10 in 2 seconds flat
/me never goes down, except for when I do
How fast is mach 10?
Fluttershy is truely a force to be reckoned with once she gets angry
I dont think this game is PG-13
Mach 10 is RD's calculated top spee
faster than mach 5, which mach 10 doesn't eve nexist
Duh CupcakeWarrior everyone knows mach 10 = 10 machs an hour duhh...
Yes, but how many mph?
A lot
AJ is willing to do things even when she knows she can't possibly do them
10 machs an hour :P
lets' say 10x faster than the speed of light
Dken2021: impossible
Shouldnt RD disintegrate from that?
it's impossible to go 1.00000000001x the speed of light
CupcakeWarrior: 7,680 mph is Mach 10...
what is 1 mach
i mean mach 1
13mein team...
She shouldnt be alive after that
Shizuka is best zombie killer
You get hit by RD, all of your bones turn into powder.
11,01F12 = Mach 1.
wow lol
Your organs liquify
13^-^
im clicking F12 and im not going mach 1
13kirz' fault for hitting the car
2,14 hey, the viewers can vouch for me
If RD can survive being a living thermonuclear explosion, what would it take to injure her?
That would suck then
your team is dying
2,14 I've got SHIT ping
:D
Shizuka: I still think you need to teach me the ways of the shizu
11,01F12 = Fujita Scale 12.
2,14 god damn zombies teleporting
The last visage you see is a rainbow coming for you
dead
Fujita! lol funny word
all dead
At least you wont feel it...
poor guys
D: aw.
Not gonna be fun explaining it to the St. at the pearly gates
I HATE it when that happens
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OOlZ__QzzM

Whats with all the hate on Gamestop?
I love Gamestop

My Gamestop isnt that bad
I like gamestop :(
One GameStop in my area isn too bad.
>Walk into Barnes And Novell

F***ING GAMESTOP
I had a nice convo with one of the employees about some games.
Welcome to planet Earth, emantrollslayer
Kira_Pony_Yamato: wah?
And then the HIPSTER was employed.
brb
Humanity are a bunch of greedy jerks, what else is new?
Pretty much every corporation on this planet is greedy...
hipsters + gamestop = not buying from you fuqs...
"Oh you're going to buy Guitar Hero, I prefer to play Bass Hero."
thats nice... I DIDNT ASK!... i said that once
got kicked out of the store
"You've probably never heard of it."
and suddenly I'm deaf
Indeed...
It took me forever to get that Fried Piper acheivement
they had a promotion where if you boght one of 5 new games for $60 you could trade it in for a whole $30 ohh my!
>Go into store with piles of games
go for the HEAD!
not the CROTCH!
>Leave with $5 instore credit
oh
F***ING GAMESTOP

I hate going to just about any store. They always! have to offer me a bunch of crap at the checkout when all I want to do is make my purchase and get on with my day. I dont need a store card, I dont want their false warrenties, or email spam. Nothing! What happened to a simple Thanks for shopping at X?
How about an official poni game, NOT FIGHTING IS MAGIC]
last thing i'd expect

don't even think about trading in a third party game, you'll barely get anything back from it
would be good
text wall
of doom
eb games, wich is ownd by gamestop funny enough, works like that here
Cypresswolf - which is when they ask the first time "do you have our rewards card," if i don't, my response is "no i don't nor am i interested, thank you"
I hate how when I ask for a first party poni game the first thing that comes up is LOLOLOLOLOLFIGHTING IS MAGIKS

hi BEN and Everlasting_Joy
Hey Phase4!
/me tackles Phase4|RecordingTest
Hello Phase4
Looks at NullRadix oddly
Why'd you link that Cherilee fic that's not finished? WHY?
11,01Can you see what we type?
Yeah
11,01K.
Now I have ANOTHER fic I have to watch out for!
NullRadix: i'm sorry, it was to awesome to not share :'(
Oh I hate this part of the game.
gtg everyone
I even clicked the music links for it
Maybe I need to start reading some FiM fanfics...
11,01Yeah.
I haven't done that for anything before!
Night night fillyfillyy.
later fillyfillyy
night fillyfillyy
CupcakeWarrior: I suggest Fallout Equestria
Nacht Filly
night fillyfillyy sleep well
Have you met with a terrible fate? Have you done something you shouldn't have done? Well then call the law offices of BEN! He drowned...
CupcakeWarrior: School Daze, unfinished but its best fic
um... I'm not sure Fallout Equestria is a "starting fic"
bye Everlastin_Joy Phase4 NullRadix otakon and everyone else
later
hold on, i think I have a good starting fic
but it's a GREAT fic!
I have read some of the more disturbing fics
it's over
otakon: It isn't MLD is it?
<<< i just want to point out that this violent game full of blood is streaming on a site were we watch 'my little pony'
Reading? You people make me sick...
Fallout Equestria is a great fic. It's also longer than LOTR
CupcakeWarrior: then you won't bat an eye at Fallout: Equestria
i still have to finish fallout
How long is Fallout Equestria?
Phase4: true, but it's no worse than Halloween 07
I dont even read creepypasta!
CupcakeWarrior: 47 chapters, 2000 pages, 600,000+ words
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-sunny-skies-all-day-long.html <-- this is a simple fic, about a half hour read, that's basically an episode
but it's GREAT!
CupcakeWarrior: long
Pfft, that's nothing
very long
Kira_Pony_Yamato: name one novel offhand that is longer than 2000 standard pages?
its tl;dr for alot of readers
Maderfole's Golden Age Trilogy
man, the videos lagging alot here
I said ONE nove
ONE
Phase4 Yeah, it is for me too.
not a TRILOGY
/me is still in the safe house after the tunnel of love
Well I'm gonna go bye everyone
each one is about one million words
FO: E is ONE NOVEL
Well, publishers always break up books for that reaoson.
Bye, SkilledSkillet
Fleur for good reasons.
later SkilledSkillet
bye SkilledSkillet
see ya SkilledSkillet sleep well
well, and profitable reasons
Night SkilledSkillet.
but I'm sure "the book is too big" is a good reason too
indeed
SkilledSKillet: Ill tell the MoonChildren to lay off it for tonight
Someone startled the witch...
stupid mips.tv
You can't sell a 2000 page book! No one will buy it. it's too heavy tolto hold.
i keep accidentaly closing the stream
I would buy it
Behold the internet! Thousands of pages! No physical weight!
yeah
Yay L4D2~!
I think the dictionary has more than 2000 pages
that's why I'm trying to get my e-reader to work right
Well... unless you count the physical objects behind the internet... but you dont have to carry those
I wouldn't be surprised
whats the page count of wikipedia?
A dictionary serves a speciifc purpose, you don't read it for hours.
linky-pages or printed pages?
dont answer, I dont know either way
And larger dictionaries are broken up into volumes.
btb, cat getting into trouble
Whats the longest fanfic on ff.net?
The OED is 13 books
lag
Argh, why do you people talk about reading so much? I mean its not like reading does anything for you!
....wow
I just dont have very much patience
point in case, FO:E is long. FO:E-PH might end up being longer (not sure page count wise, but the "halfway point" was 33 supposedly)
CupcakeWarrior let me know if you find out, I'm curious as well
"So the smoker" *shades "got smoked."
*sigh*
:$
I can think of one novel that's 1000 pages long, and it's not a very well regarded Novel...
NullRadix: the 'down to the wire' thing in school daze, someone needs to sing that
that needs to be made
No, wait, three.
floating zombie...
.. I could see it... I think the notes were *slightly* off from the text, but I might be wrong
Zombies are mean, i mean seriously
Atlas Shrugged, Battlefield Earth, and one of the "Wheel of Time" books.
indeed they are
13we are pro team
NullRadix: they were a bit, but still needs to be made
2,14 that lag spike during the horde made me worry
Two books that aren't well-liked, and a book that was part of a series so long the author didn't live to finish it.
Phase4: are you volunteeting?
11,01Shizuka's kicking ass
volunteering*
lllaaagggg
Play the Sun's Song it stops redeads!
13^-^
BEN ha!
found a Teen Titans fic called These Black Eyes that has 2,579,204 words
NullRadix: not realy, i sing like poop
okay
fine
Phase4|RecordingTest: Ding
there ARE longer ones out there
Hold on, laundry calling
nope, still dropping frames :(
I love the clown's "honk" noise.

/me hugs Everlasting_Joy and otakon and gives them hamz
Otakon did you get ze game yet? :P

"Application provided invalid, non monotonically increasing dts to muxer in stream 1:" <RAGE\>

here we go agian
so, just spent 45 minutes reading a chapter on phsyics so i would know how to do the homework, did the homework in 5 minutes...
okay
time spend is disproportionate...homework is way too easy
the real question is
BEN is pretending to be that one guy from the "haunted copy of Majora's Mask"
otakon: no no no man, you puttin me to sleep, to death bro, the line is SAY WHAT?!?!
do you retain the knowledge of that chapter
I wouldnt pay him much mind otakon
okay
obviously i did, i just did the homework without having to do any calculations on paper and it was all basic concepts of physics
/me keeps his mind in his pocket
lol
Fleur: Correction, I am the one guy from the haunted copy of Majora's Mask
13^-^
Haunted copy?
So how have you been otakon
okay
thats good
CupcakeWarrior: the one and only
not too shabby today, got some stuff done
hi everypony

/me gives otakon a thumbs up
so I might not be on too much
tomorrow until the evening here
understandable
and now we get to watch the mods die again... yay :)
10,02Arentius: I don't have a delayed reaction :3

Fleur: ah

10,02valoreins: OMG That's an epic drawing!!

yeah valoreins it's damn good
BEN what happened?
otakon: some pesky kid on Cleverbot called me over

10,02Then why are we playing L4D2?!
11,01I like L4D2 more.
13cause that's what val has :P
10,02Haha, no way I'm getting that game now
11,01More varied.
they ported all of l4d1 to l4d2
I bought both as a bundle before the L4D1 campaigns got ported
Talk about ironic! I love the idea of Bloddy Tears but I hate the idea of someone destroying ghosts, demons, and other monsters!
10,02I'll play and stream L4D after you Val if anypony wants to play that.
*Bloody
2,14 oh you whore!
2,14 not letting me download it and install!

CupcakeWarrior fun things :)

:D
yeah when that happens
I run into a corner
So what is ever"ponies" favorite episode in Season 2 so far?
BEN Last Roundup
The Last Roundup :P
has to be the Cider episode
You know I happy for Derpy and Imma let her finish, but Lesson Zero was amazing, people going insane, a time limit, although the end was kinda dull...
Was the cider episode supposed to be a parody or something?
CupcakeWarrior like a lot of folks, it reminded me of The Music Man and the monorail episode from The Simpsons
CupcakeWarrior: think the Music Man
I have never heard of it :(
yeah the song number was inspired by tehe Muscic Man
it's a musical
that and the Monorail song
That is probably why then
Nope
11,01Stupid mod makes the witch emit fire electricity.
2,14 ikr?
2,14 for ONCE I'd like to get a non modded server
Dumb Mod(ification)!

>Mfw I found out there is electricity in Equestria.
:[
the WITCH shoots out lighting bolts?
Whats up everyone? =P
Cavy: yeah, but it's pretty primitive
Well, they have microphones, so.

No..
>At the Gala
Cavy: I drove a guy insane today

Hold on, I'll send you the video.

Left for dead? Not bad.
Oh, hey Placebo. Long time no see.
Whoa man. what a coincidence.
Hm?
Just figured the chances of seeing somebody I know were slim to none if it wasn't during a new episode.
Haha. I'm on here all the time now.
Nice.
Last thing I said to you...
Stars live in Caves, Bears live in the sky.
Canon.
oh but you know me Placebo... the Moon Children and I visit you often...
Lol. 'Twas an epic conversation.

Sounds like BEN's work.
/me calls BS on the witch
Watching Best Night Ever.

No one is forever alone here! Wubbed.

Placebo: not with the Moon CHildren...
Not Celestias children!
I feel much safer with these Moon Children looking out for me.
LadyCanary: not between the Moon Children, Slendy, and me!
Just realized...
I really should make a batch of cookies for 'em.
Hey Cavy :)
Hey EmeraldChocolate!
:O
we sucked :(
'Ello Simon
PLacebo: they like human heart chip
Everyone, what episode of MLP do I watch now?
I'm a college student, that's out of my budget... How's pig heart?
Just watched Best Night Ever.

I've seen them all.
Placebo: It might fool them...
Must choose best one.
S1E4. Eeyup.

>Is watching ponies. AWWW yeah
nice
Ponies > school
I should probably be in bed right now
ponies > bodily needs
Ponies > Driving people insane
Although, my favorite one at the moment might be May the Best Pet Win, just because of the "Dun dun dun" and the fact that Rainbow Dash whistles to Ride Of The Valkyries

Cavy: Lesson Zero, it's basically MAjora's MAsk

Chur bro
I'm brutally honest, i'll warn you.
Lesson Zero is great....time to watch...
hiii girlsss.
Damn...Can't take the brutal honesty...

That's beautiful Cavy!
Huh?
nvm
Lol i'll post it'
>>
800 words.. gimmme 3 minutes.
Oh, my story? =P
Gold runs through my veins. At least that's what they told me. From birth, they would brag, I was destined for greatness. Is it wrong that I doubt that? There are so many ponies that are so fantastic at what they do best, what gained them the privilege to wear that symbol on their flank. I wasn't even close to greatness. I was pathetic.
BEAUTIFUL!
Suddenly, wall of text
Darkness then Redness then Whiteness.
Lollz
I thought it was a good paragraph =P
It's not generally a good idea to have a summary taken straight from the story.
:|
First paragraph =(
/me raises no objections to the very well written paragraph
Oh god, Placebo is reading my story.
:)
Oh Noez
Permission to post a video link to describe my emotion?
Cavy: <3
It's beautiful.
Actually, everyone go into Rainbow Dash chat.

Nah, that'd require a flash link or something.

I do, too. Between fanfics and books, I spend probably 4 hours a day in it, if I have the time.
/me does not understand the human infatuation with words...
I'm writing my next chapter tomorrow.

Guys, Mods are asleep.

Transformers 3 was pretty awesome
Meh.
SuperBrony64, it seems that MLP FiM is the rival show of Transformers.
Not really
So, thats why I said that.
10,02Transformers is bad and it should feel bad.
13^
Eeyup.
13beast wars was good though
good graphic, bad story
Wait...
10,02But the funniest thing I saw online was...
13cause Mainframe knew how to handle it, they did more storytelling than toy selling
Has everyone seen Rainbow Dash vs Star Scream?

Lesson Zero isn't helping my imagination..
Lol.
I missed pt this morning because of ponies.
Confound them
>Just read Rainbow Factory and Sweet Apple Massacre.
ugh.
oh good god *cans.wav*
<Sad Pony.
Hi
I liked Rainbow Factory. As it was written, any way. Not the plot, really.
Sweet Apple....God..
I've read about half of Rainbow Factory.
In my eyes, thats just as bad as the Fiction we can't talk about.
The writing is very good. I just.. was afraid to go further.
hey guys :)
Yea. The ending is kinda of upsetting.
Sweet Apple Massacre was funny to me until I saw a CMC themed episode
Howdy TOY_PON3
MLD should be an example for good fanfic
Exactly CupcakeWarrior.
From what I've heard about sweet apple Massacre, I have no interest in it.
CupcakeWarrior: Just no...
hey Cavy
I feel bad now
Except to me, it was never funny.
Hey TOY_PON3.
:'(
It's just sick and it's okay CupcakeWarrior
My fiction is interesting.
10,02This better not be discussion of Gore fanfictions.
Nope
Bad fanfics in general
I'm just mad because half of Pony fans wont read anything with sadness.
Nnnope
SuperBrony64: Hiya :)
10,02Ohai TOY_PON3
I don't like sad endings. Relatively speaking, anyway.
We are losing D:
MLD has like, 6 endings from fans.. Lol
Yep.
Hey Simon2 and sorry to hear
I still support you! :)
sup TOY_PON3
I don't like majority of other stories endings.
/me will never read MLD
what is MLD?
The one I do like is about the fiction we can't talk about.
My Little Dashie
Because I can't stand the thought of Dashie..
Yes.
Plus the Phil Caullins song tribute with it that makes me tear up.
Yea*
/me sheds Big Maccin tear
:'(
Eeyup.com
Manly tears... they have been shed.
^Bestwebsiteever.
and LOL @ that link, Cavy
/me loves Dashie too much to read it
Go to that website..
/me isn't a father yet so it doesn't break my heart THAT much
/me also isn't a father, but really left me with an empty feeling.
^ is a rainbow fanboi, though
/me hugs Cavy
/me cries.
:(
Y'all bring me down.
/me sad face
Placebo make us happy
brb crying in the corner of my room...
xD
I want people to hate me for writing my fic, Placebo.
/me sheds more manly tears
Sound weird?
Quite a bit.
Lets talk about happy things
http://www.youtube.com./watch?v=jDMGv3hNMes
I want people to hate me for writing such a sad story, yet at the same time like the story.

I think May the Best Pet Win gives you the best idea of what she's like to be honest.
Dont mention clopfics :'(
whatever you like, TOY_PON3 , whatever you like.
:D
/me does not actually reads them except once, it was weird..
:|
10,02:|
^me too
Meh.

Quite.

My watch list on fimfiction is growing to big >.>

Placebo: me too
Confound these stories.
has anyone wrote a "good" fanfic about zecora? why is she in the everfree forest not with her tribe or somthing...
/me hugs imaginary ponies
Ponies are real.
>.>
valoreins: I'm sure there is one somewhere.
/me says that so he won't realize the horrible truth
:'(
I have a horse.
My horse is amazing.
Give it a lick ~~
:(
It tastes just like glue
"PS, Obviously Spike did not have to learn a lesson because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for. Unlike everyone else, he took things seriously."
:[
/me hates glue forever
^Truestory
:D
Am I the only one very disturbed by the MLP brand Glue sticks?
I mean, REALLY?
Nnnope I am too
That's a bit..disturbing...
Placebo: Those EXIST?! :'(:'(
Purple glue....I'm scared..
lol Rarity and Twilight Sparkle glue sticks
Yeah, man. Whole bunch of school supplies now.
I can see it now..
:D
Was posted a while ago on EQ:D

SPIDERSES
Omg.
I can't express my hate.
What is that?
SPIDERSES is funny as hell
It's stupid -.-
it's intended to be stupid
2,14 alrighty, and that was my stream
No joke.
ty for the invite Val :3
thanks ValtheJean
2,14 hope you enjoyed everyone, I'll be handing it over to super now
But it isn't funny, in it's stupid way.
Thanks Val <3
/me NOMS EVERYPONY!

Placebo: Its horrible!
Thanks, ValtheJean!
Eeyup.
lol, we beat the mods that time YAY!
lol
Best Fic, Placebo?
Idk. I'm watching Equestria: Total War right now.
Placebo: Twilight spider and Big Mac spider make spider babies :D
btw, how do you italize fonts? <<bronystate newb
Placebo?
Cavy: I dunno, man. It's hard to say, especially with all the different categories.
Gimme something with RD in it.
<3 Some RD Fic.
Ohai :3
Placebo: I guess I'd have to go with the one I've spent the most time on, Fallout Equestria.
LMAO
I did NOT just message myself.
dat SuperBrony64
xD
Fallout Equestria sounds epic.
10,02Who wants to hear a funny joke? :D
Sure.
Sure
Eeyup
10,02What's the difference between a toilet and a fridge?
c-c-c-combo BREAKER
@ Placebo.
I have no clue, by the way.
/me waits for answer
10,02You're disgusting >:(
Well, I know a real answer.
HAha
/me jumps up and down in anticipation
10,02^__^
whats the answer SB!
...wut
eating fried scootaloo right now
*rimshot*
/me glomps SuperBrony64
I don't get it
Not Scootaloo!
10,02<Cavy> I have no clue, by the way. <---Disgusting :3
/me joins the ponypile on SuperBrony64
/me is glomped O_O
1,3lol
/me is confused.
Scootaloo is best fried chicken
/me noms SuperBrony64's mane
/me noms SuperBrony64's ears
if she did she probably woulnt want to because Spiek would see her as a spider and maybe get scared or angry and then stomp all ove r her which would make her dead spider twilight abd that is bad.
Cavy: RD chatroom for fic cdiscussion
/me is being nommed ;____;
Ugh
DAT FIC.
Excerp of Spiderses
xD
@_@
Go ahead, Placebo.
The irony of that damn fic
blargh.

/me sneaks up behind SuperBrony64 and noms
MLP Newborn Cuties is the cutest thing ever!
10,02O___O
/me pins the broomstick and keeps nomming SuperBrony64 while fighting back with an umbrella
So, yeah, Fallout Equestria is amazing, but you have to really get into it.
2,14 hell yeah it is
CupcakeWarrior: I agree
2,14 Scootaloo needs more party time
:3
Mainly because it's set in the future, and revolves around OCs.
zombies FOREEVVVVEEERRRR!!! *nomnomnomnom*
10,02My wife just called me.
10,02She said, "The two kids want you to take them Bowling on Saturday, then afterwards they want you to take them to the cinema."
10,02"It's either one or the other," I said, "otherwise it's too expensive."
10,02"Okay," she replied. "Which one do you prefer?"
Someone should stream it
10,02I said, "David."
O.o
But, dear God, it gets so good when you get into it.

wait, wait. Are you asking for ideas about writing one?
Amy Winehouse died when...yeah i don't even remember
No.
I thought you wanted a link to a story about her?

10,02Ohai :3
Yea, Shipping is OK..
05the NT of my maths class is in 3 weeks
dammit SuperBrony64 I don't know math jokes :(
10,02:O
05teach me the whole course from ground up
10,02K
SUP WREK!
10,02What's 2+2=?
oops caps* sorry
1,35
055
05ohsit¨
sit on what?
10,02It's okay, this is a learning opportunity
dat ohsit
suns mass is equal to the remaining apples ^100000000000000 x fruit bats
1,3damnit, script killed my number
Just, I don't like it when Dash gets shipped with girls to be honest. Not that I'm anti gay or anything. It just seems to be an assumption that her mane indicates that she is a Lesbian.
Let's see... Equestria: Total war is great so far... Not RD centric, though. Kinda features everypony
When, based on the newest episode, she's not.
the answer is 42
10,02Hint, it's less than 5 but greater than 3
I don't mind it if it's pulled off well..
1,32+2=5 for very large quantities of 2
10,02O___O
1,3*2+2

Hurrhurr Appledash annoys me, though
If you can make it realistic, go for it.

	A hole has been found in the nudist camp wall. The police are looking into it.
To be honest, you might have to force your character to OC to ship.
/me tackle-glomps kirzstryfe
<_< >_>
1,3eye now math und engrish grammuh
I don't mind shipping if it goes from the character being themself to them getting to that point.
mfw Kirz gets 2 glomps and SB neglects me
1,3my glomps :p
05the area between 2 curves, in the section of 5S10 when the following function is 3x dx
/me tackle-glomps Arentius
it's fine
agreed.
I'm used to SB neglecting me
he always does
/me tackle-glomps the glomp
I don't like it when the character is different from canon, which, in my first chapter, Dash is. However, I'm planning on letting her come out a bit more for a while.
poor Arentius
Let Dashie be Dashie.
/me hugs Arentius tightly
he claims to wub me but He doesn't really :< I only get hugs when I complain :P
Well, you also have the "willing suspension of disbelief" going.
Then again, who says Rainbow Dash is thinking what she's saying and doing?
You have Dash before we see her in the show.
Exactly.
1,3isn't that what family's for though?
/me curls into a ball in the corner and yawns
wub? *wubwubwubwubwubwub*
10,02Wrek: I can help you with that, but Section of 5S10?
1,3to hug you when you start to bitch too much? ^_^
As long as she acts as she's portrayed by she reaches age X, you're in line.
ouch kirz...just ouch
o-o
It's your discretion as an author to make up how she gets there.
/me hugs Arentius
just for that imma go play a game on easy and imagine all the enemies are you >.>
Right.
05its the interval
hi
So, I don't get an insight into your Fic?
=(
05but irc doesnt allow fancy signs
10,02Oh, so from 5 - 10?
/me hugs Midnight_Tempest
Hiya djdashie.
05mhm
/me hugs TOY_PON3 back
10,02What's the second curve function?
hi all
No more math!
hay sb64
no math, yes meth!
Math is Magic
Into my fic? Honestly, it's not very far along, and I'm still piecing the backstory together, so it at least makes sense.
05iirc it was along the lines of 2xcos4
djdashie: Howdy!
What do you have when a lawyer is buried up to his neck in sand?
/me cowers in fear
howdy
/me hugs kirzstryfe and SuperBrony64 with umbrellas
10,02Well, first you need to graph the two together to see which is higher than the other.
Not enough sand.
Perhaps I can help?
=/
Don't use yer fancy math-uh-matics to confound the issue.
We could pop open, in the words of the 4chanistas...
Why did the Scootaloo cross the road?
Dat Private chat
To escape the Colonel?
this... this must be... CALCULUS!!! *explodes*
Your call. I'd hate to sound like an idiot. xD
05is ee
what's calculus?
05oh and SB
Terror
<.>
10,02Yeah?
Honestly, between school, military, work, helping on another project, and it, it just isn't seeing the time it needs.
calculus is EXTREMELY advanced math
8,1the thought of differential calculus warms my toes in bed at night
No seriously why did Scootaloo cross the road.
:P
10,02Calculus is the math of change.
what's uncouth?
05how the fuck do i take out the f`` of f(x)=4x -cos^2
Military?
o.o
8,1Midnight_Tempest: can't tell if joking or not
lol
10,02You take the derivative of the derivative.
I'm a Cadet.
05righto
1,3can you do that?
1,3can you derivitate twice?
8,1Wrek: easy, just take the two terms seperately and apply chain rule to the latter
Bronystate is best site for learning :3
Ah.
8,1then do it again
Thank Celestia im only in algebra 2
10,02Yup, the second derivative of 4x becomes 0.
DUN DUN DUNNN
i dont wanna learn... not yet
64 lol
my...BRAIN IT BURNSA!
CupcakeWarrior: Thank Luna I'm only in Alg 3/Geometry
05ok SB
/me explodes
megusta.jpg
05ill ask my teacher for a copy of the NT a few terms back
05and we go through it problem by problem
10,02Alright, sounds like fun :>
Pootis equation here!
make the equations pony related... then i will learn it better
Not sure if trolling, or mathmatic nuts..
their both in school
Yes math with ponies will soooo help me
05sincei dunno how teh fuq the US schools do their classes
05but if im correct
8,1sb, you're a physicist as well, aren't you?
05im in calc atm
8,1or some science
/me slaps Artemis around a bit with a large trout.
10,02Biomedical Engineering
night sb
8,1aye
10,02Night djdashie
Wrek: US schooling is very complicated
8,1that's basically biology, but with *useful* maths, right?
SB... you better make nanomachines that make us all powerful, and the bronies need to get it first
05we just call it math D
05math A to E
seems much more simplier
05et
05c
05for isntance currently reading eng C
05which is the highest available language course
Wrek: Nice
10,02It's basically the combination of a background in engineering techniques while specializing in biological applications.
nanomachines
10,02^
but i thought school in US is fun... i saw this teen thing on disney channel, they all do is singing and dancing
Yup, being a junior in high school sucks.
05anyways
05i begin in 50 minutes
valoreins: not sure if serious or sarcasm...
10,02Tissue engineering is an excellent aspect of a bioengineer.
okie doki loki
05then i have math for 20 minutes
0530*
8,1hey Wrek, i just remembered, you can do your problem really easily using the product rule
10,02Good luck Wrek!
i did sing back in high school...
05then I can go home
05cause i have no morel essons for the day :D
10,02Yup, break up the function to be -[cos(x) * cos(x)]
school is nothing like Glee... stupid effing show
You know..I wish Twilight Sparkle could be my tutor :(
lol
^
05sin/cos/sin/cos
10,02Product rule is f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x)
05they jsut switch dont they?
Why can't Ponies tutor us and help us in school?!
/me cries
05when you deriviate them?
oh god... the maths... IT BURNS
iknowthatfeelbro.jpg
10,02Sin > Cos > -Sin > -cos >
omg
Math=:P
math
Midnight_Tempest: Don't look at it
meth
10,02In derivative order
I haven't seen math in YEARS
05then it just loops?
save yourself otakon... RUN!
otakon: Really?
no
I must LEARN again
10,02Yup
Learning is Magic
yeah, I haven't done major math in years
/me takes a note
learn like twilight sparkle
l/me switches to maths function on his calculator
10,02Going from cos to sin while doing the derivative inverses the sign
Everyday I'm studying!
._. my mind just went blank...
11,01Night.
10,02Night Nittany_Discord!
math? yaoming.jpg
Night Nittany_Discord
/me is back
Goodnight Nittany
hello, good night Nittany_Discord
welcome back Phase4
8,1(f * g)` = f` * g + g` * f <-- product rule
8,1iirc
10,02What I said silly :3
brb gonna go get ready for bed :D
05whats g?
so whats ` meen'
10,02g is your second function
8,1i meant to type that in like 3 minutes ago
http://i42.tinypic.com/imi3jm.png NMM is a happy pony.
8,1but i had to blow my nose
05i think we're using a different symbol for that but hmm
10,02Basically: if h(x)=f(g(x)) then h'(x) = f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x)
05FUCK THIS IM AN ARTIST, i shouldnt have to deal with this >.>
10,02O U
8,1all that means is that if you take the derivative of the product of two functions, you can apply that rule
Suddenly Trig doesn't seem so bad.
"i'm an english major, you do the math"
@Wrek i know that feel bro
I don't know anything about them ' s there.
8,1i really don't understand this: do people *honestly* find trig hard?
05you know what the worst part is?
8,1like, seriously?
I just started learning about f(g(x))
05i have to translate the terms they use, and guess where they go
^ Nope. But it isn't fun, either.
anyone wanna let me draw the humanized version of this scene? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdsEjfCbzk
Ive never been to trig
never found trig hard, school didnt go past right angle triangles though
8,1Placebo: i think trig is fun...
valoreins: For the love of God, at least use some censors or something.
i found out about the general ... something (cant remember the name) on my own
10,02Trig should go die in a fire.
"--guys, what if--what if the DRAGONS had a COUNTRY and they were invading the ZEBRAS and then we were helping them out, I mean the zebras 'cause they have hooves too, and then what if the gryphons helped out the dragons 'cause they have wings and OH MY GOSH--"
10,02Trig identities are the WORST thing ever in math.
-Pinkie Pie
SuperBrony64: so ' is "take the derivative of"?
actually
Cavy, that's stupid. You're stupid!
10,02I'd love to see a 'take the derivative of' for a function...but not if it involves trig identities
please... no more math... please...
imma pilot, dun need ur silly mathmaticz
10,02ANYWAY
trig is WAY beyond me atm
05oh and SB
05i failed math C
10,02Stream will be up in a minute
05on the point
goodie
10,02Sorry to hear that Wrek :(
Thank god
but it's 2 am here
05I TRIPPEDO N 1 friggin POINT
brb
10,02:O
1,3it's been about 5 years since I've done calc >.<
10,02How is that going to affect your graduation?
05though i got a B on math A and B
hiya kirzstryfe
So, what I've established tonight... SuperBrony64 +50 respects for being match whiz.
i would have done better at math, except my high school confused 'math' with 'graphing'
gods, I feel like a idiot
1,3hehe
i am an idiot...
/me slaps a large trout around a bit with Artemis.
10,02i liek math...to an extent
stupid MATH
8,1hey now, graphing is important
this didnt make any sense to me...
05unless i comp the NT for C
05nothign changes
brb, my mom's gonna use the PC now..
8,1i *love* maths, but then if i didn't, i wouldn't be studying computer science
10,02Don't worry Wrek, I'll make sure you pass your test.
1,3SB, now you have to play something completely innane on stream to make everypony feel better
10,02okay :3
i havent been in school for a decade... i dont remember anything anymore
not 20 times per class
05cause C isnt counted and obligatory clearance
05math B is though
05current problem is chemistry
05now that i also failed
10,02Chemistry is ALWAYS a problem
05but
10,02FUCK ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
05its coutned as obligatory clearance
Is chemistry hard?
05so without it
05im fucked
CupcakeWarrior: are you in highschool? Or college?
10,02What are you going to do then?
High school
05take the comp next month and pray
05(to satan)
10,02Which you need my help to study, right?
05mhmmm
8,1i'm ashamed to say that i know little chemistry and hardly any biology
05there are only 3 more comp opportunities this term
10,02I'm cool with Biology, but Chemistry is a damn nightmare
10,02Organic Chemistry: Synthesis and Mechanisms is one of the hardest classes I have ever taken.
CupcakeWarrior: Highschool Chemistry isn't anything to worry about. Periodic table, nuff said.
8,1i studied chemistry to Standard Grade (equivalent of GCSE) at school
05and its my last term of 12th grade
8,1but didn't do any biology
05yey
10,02Wrek, you can count on me to help you pass this test ^_^
http://www.sosmath.com/ this looks neat
05now if i dotn dash right this second
05I wont be able to buy smokes before i take the bus
10,02Alright, later then :P
05so ill see ya all after math
10,02Later!
1,3good luck
8,1Wrek: and if that doesn't work, come see me ;)
10,02Phase4: That site looks like garbage
it LOOKS like garbage, content seems good though
10,02If there's one site in the world that will save your ass in any class
10,02That's Cramster
05oh look what a simple site
/me slaps Presea around a bit with a large Artemis

05cryign sinus curves
8,1no, no.
i head a ding but no-one dinged me

Midnight_Tempest: Umad?
woah
This is best math
now i wanna quick answer. no rage jus a question
damn it!
I don't have the brain for math atm!
why didnt we show te episode last tim?e

err.... again.... why didn we show the episode right away last time? superbrony, ik you can answer it at least...
I know :P
otakon: i have to get my ISP Provider to send me a new one.
herostar: because it didn't encore
that's why
encore?
It should arrive in some 9 hours

Placebo: I like Pawn Stars
SuperBrony64: What would your son, David, say to that?!

Pawn stars is pretty good

baaaiiiiiiiiii
Dat list.
I saw SW
night herostar
*SAW
derpys eyes are so cute
NOT THE DUKE
it's the duke!
oh no... Duke Nukem Forever... dumb game but so fun to play
Not this game...
omg
I heard it sucked
It does
it does
ye gods WHY?
horribly
Ladies and Gentlemen: Duke Nukem Forever: 12 years of dev and it sucks
LOL
I went to the midnight launch of this.
Phase4: not suprising
this game has people either loving it or hating it
but that makes it so fun to play, cause its so 1990's
Placebo: you have my pity
:O?
the damned game was in development longer than the consoles it runs on combined were
were combined'
You fool. You run them over with your car!
they had seven years and they still failed
I am dissapoint
MahBoi777: 12
they had 12 years
thank you
Use the boost to get through!
12 years
NO EXCUSES
I guess people got so much used to modern day FPSs they forgot what it was like to play a 90s FPS
they didnt change anything during that time, they didnt want to... it was meant to be a throwback to the old FPS games of the 90's
SB's driving skills leave something to be desired..
BEST DRIVING EVAR
Pro tip: crouch
Midnight_Tempest: except this isnt a 90's shooter
dafaq?
Phase4: no, but it was meant to be...
10,02So yeah, this is OnLive everypony ^_^
his voice is funny
10,02Cloud gaming :D
ohai everypony
onlive sucks!
10,02:<
ohai Jim
i am beginning to suspect that mlp:fim's songs are nonpareil
i haven't tried it yet.
steam is better
don't be s bashful, at least it's not taking up your HDD
4th wall!
can't watch stream at the moment, I'm on a too crappy internet :P
Goodnight guys
i would not pay for onlive, but they offer free demos
10,02But all the games are stored in the cloud and none of the content is running locally so I can have the worst computer ever to be able to play all of these games still
night CupcakeWarrior
Jim: you're missing out on some good ol' duke.
later CupcakeWarrior
cupcakes...
Oo, duke
10,02The other cool thing
and g'night cupcake
onlive looks good, but the imputlag is horrible where i live
So, you like have it for the 360, but are able to play remotely?
i know SB, but my computer is good enough to play most of these games so i dont need onlive
it doesnt work like that
10,02Is if you have an OnLive account, you can watch me play live as well :3
its PC to PC
smokin a cigar, LIKE A BAWS
you could do that?
wait... can i interact with your game too SuperBrony64?
Midnight_Tempest: Oh. So like, if I had a desktop at home, I can play it on my laptop at the airport type thing?
yeah, thats very similar
Great. Who wants to buy ol' placebo a desktop?
Run towards the flame! LET THE LIGHT GUIDE YOU!
onlive is the videogame is running somewhere else ("in the cloud") and the video is sent to you
cloud gaming lets people who have not so decent computers play games that would otherwise kill those computers
Got ya..
10,02All of the game content is played on the cloud so you don't need to upgrade your GPU to play the high end games. Plus it doesn't store any content locally.
Sounds legit.
it's so beautiful
10,02But yeah, if you watch me, it'll show you as spectacing me and you can rate me with Cheers and Jeers while I play
10,02OnLive is free to use :3
i want the demo's but there's no australian servers. it doesnt just let me play with lag, it actualy stops me
/me used Jeer!
10,02Name is Coolmatt49 in case you want to add me as a friend :3
/me it's super effective!
just says NOPE, no games for you
I'm not a big PC gamer, sadly. Laptop is nice, but can't handle some games.
that great and all, but I want to do all of that PC building at least once in my life
hmmmm, chocolate milk
when i have the money for videogames i will have a machine powerfull enough for them anyway
ya gotta jump maaaaan

it's the best of the worst possible thing
theres a few really good games coming out within the next month or so

i'll just wait for Fighting is Magic... :3
supposedly extremely extensive lore
why doesnt the doctor have a remote controll for the tardis?
Oh the gambling
the demo was very good, it was just buggy as it could physically be
SuperBrony64: Gambling your life's savings away..
COME ON LUCKY 7

did you have to do -input-eager on x11vnc?
i tend to use openbox because it happens to be installed on my machine
I like the name : 3
I really like your.... name?
LOL
ah, okay
GADOOSH
for me, whenever i had fast video updates (i.e., whenever i was on the stream), it wouldn't process my inputs
but it seems to be working with that switch
well mine lags anyway
anyhoos, time to test my recording!
SB64 imma watch your DA :D
placebo? u awake?
Nnope
8,1yay, comes out smooth as anything
ah, very good, proceed
i seem to have caused all the linux brony's to start recording the stream
8,1got it recording at 25 fps from xvfb
8,115 was the maximum from compiz
8,1*15
O.O
Do you think a unicorn could use a cane? Like as an actual way to support themselves as they walk?
my eyes....
yeah... I think I'll be sleeping now =w=
so good night everyone : 3
I was pondering it, yet I can't feel completely sure about it.
But..
niiiiighty niiight
night Roxsnow
Livestream > bodily functions
/me hugs everyone <3
Roxsnow: Sleep tight!
8,1Phase4: hell, xvfb draws the actual stream faster than compiz
/me calls dibs on #BronyState
goodnight!
I think bodily functioms are more imortant than stream
8,1i.e. the stream is a lot smoother in my recording than it is to actually watch
LOL
no kiddin
/me waves his cane around to get attention
8,1aye
hey Davie
8,1i use it instead of xfwm
8,1it look preeetty
I am thinking about my ponysona having a cane, yet I am not completely sure that a unicorn could use a cane as it was intended.
and the multiple desktops make me fell sorry for windows users
Mmagic
Oh man, I'd best be hittin the ol dusty trail, goodnight all!
05btw my goal atm it to reach the level acme station
05then im calling it draw time
gnight Mah Boi
NIIIIGHT!
I doubt I'm going to make it that far in T_T
Well I know he'd move it useing magic, yet a cane works by putting your weight on it in lue of your leg. Can you still put weight on it with magic?
Of course. It's magic.
gotta use your Imaginaaation
*rainbow*
Well.. I guess it'd be telepathy in reverse.
isnt telepaty implicitly two way?
No
Normally, you would lift an object using your mind or magic with yourself as a focal point.
In reverse, you would lift yourself using another point as a focal point.
thats telekenesis
telepathy is talking with your mind
^
Right, thanks.
It's basicly what the baby unicorn did in Pinky Pie's episode.
Walk through walls?
lOl
She made herself fly
using the ground as a focal point.
Pumpkin cake could Phase :P
Ah. That's been fannon since Fo:E, if not before.
Of course that was during her first surge, so I don't believe she could do it again
in fo:e self levitation takes alot of effort for some reason
FO:E?

I have more time logged in that story than I do in skyrim.
inb4 boss battle
Placebo: i'l just chheck that
It is the same princible as a pully. It takes more effert to lift yourself on a pully than it does to lift something else with similar weight.
Phase4: check that?
And I base that on absolutly nothing.
608026 words
including some other junk
probably closer to 60800
608000'
Someone has a lot of freetime

65k lines in the pdf format

"Hmmm.. I could learn a new language, or cure cancer.... or I could write a really long fanfiction!"
No offense, but what say do you have in how someone spends their time? =s

But actually, I meant Kriza & Rain.
and some other guy who;s name i cant remember

haha~
Kriza is *** and Rain i'm not sure
Imma talkin' bout someone special >3<
Oh ok~
/me is Fleur

/me is shocked.
ohai Funkballs
lol

Oh that's something I didn't know~
Wrek you should send me that sketch <3
05in due time
You made me look so good <3
lol
Ok then ^_^
/me knows who Kriza is but is derp and not sure he's alowed to say, even though its trivial to find out
Hmm. Kriza, are you John?
Kriza: Are you a Wizard?
Dat Ictiv.
why would it be trivial to say who Kriza is?
there are some who call me... Kriza
no, trivial to find out. allso trivial to say but not want i ment
Can we get hints?
who?
Phase4 Are you talking in code now or is it strange that I do not understand you.
(dats your hint)
well tis 23:15 and i'm working of some small amount of sleep
Haha, Cwutididthar
it might be code
Hm...
Code. Phase4. haha
Is it game time?~
eh, done with dragonquest, too much grinding
pjao Dken2021
I really hope that doesn't mean Kriza is some Doctor Who reference
ohai'
Dken2021 you do dragonquest?
I'm still watching original series
try to, mostly far in DQVII
ohai Phase4
DQVII... which one is that? I only did 8&9
and hi Ictiv, didnt notice you entering
time to get audio back
oh, I meant 8
But aslong as Kriza=/=Kammerjunk I don't care that much. its Kamma-junk who I want to talk to
Ooo ok.
Kriza: is not kammerjunk
Oh I was lurking for quite some time Phase4
another hint
Doom yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
but there's so much grinding I just stop and pick up after a month or so
It went into lurking mode though now...
Dken2021 Metal king slimes~
After a couple of weeks your dreams are filled with those demons -_-
i've been here sense september but still feel like a newbie, is that normal?
u finished your drawing Wrek?
Play nicely now my pets... I'll be watching... *dramatic 30s sci-fi space emeperor look*
O U Ictiv
(yes that is a thing now)
never played Doom2.......
stimpack?
i thought that was a fallou thing
A stimpack is used in many games~
like StarCraft
&Bioshock
thaaaaats the stuuuuf.............
Oh & thingy. fallout i think
aaaaaaa
noooooo
OMG
wow, the tv on at this time of night is strange
this doom2 looks fckn great
:O?
and its a serious film, not a comedy
talk about a twist
dabuq?
Oh~ That sounds intresting~
i'm sure its an excelent film, but i cant speak its language and thats a bit much wut for me
Phase4 what's the name? I think i've seen it
gimi a sec
aaaaaaa
owait, just remembered I got 8 bit deathmatch
Starflash: my bad, its the one thats on next http://www.yourtv.com.au/guide/event.aspx?program_id=165967&event_id=43916602&region_id=94
wait........ is this Doom 2 or a mod?
point is it exists
lemme check
05this is plutonia
I wonder if Kriza went into lurking mode too or not
i think http://www.yourtv.com.au/guide/event.aspx?program_id=236282&event_id=43847452&region_id=94 is whats on the screen now
05comes after doom 2
05you could call it doom 3
owwwww
05with TNT being doom 4
Oh, thank god, I don't know it.
Pass the brain bleach please
this looks fuckn awesome
i just played standard Doom..... MAAAANY TIMES
Starflash: its on in 8 minutes, i could attempt a stream?
Sure.
It won't be WMC'd, I think...
But some people would vote for it because of the sheer weirdness
ok... i dont have an antena and someone's using the tv
must get a roof antena at some point
+Wrek. XD
do have a usb tuner though
btw....... y u cant move sideways........ i remeber i did it in first Doom
Ohai :3
Phase4 MFW that movie comes from my country...
hello there eman
hi emangamer
Ohai emangamer ~
hello Wrek <3
Oh hey emangamer +~
I mean r~*
Dat tildetypo@
fluttershy is most remixed pony
so, apparently a couple of people got really pissed about derpy or something and now last roundup if off of itunes or something
Sheesh
about the little woops-its-a-girl-after-all, emangamer?
probably those itune comments
Starflash: no about just derpy in general
anti-derpy people
-_-
Starflash: wow, your country is wierd
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/addendum-to-derpy-hooves.html
those people do exist?
hi emangamer
hey Phase4
Phase4 yeah
Oooohh boy
we're rumored to have no sense of humor at all XD
This is interesting. So I'm talking to an alien in the Pony RP server
Fortunately, that's just part of the people
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyni05HiqB1qd1hleo1_500.jpg
This woman playing Fluttershy swears up and down that she is an alien in real life.
emangamer: so true
have you got a copy of the bronystate one
huh?
She says she's on a mission to save the Gaia, who I think lives in the Earth, from the horrors of mankind.
someone put the bronystate logo where the mlp logo is
hahahaha
MY GOD... http://emangamer.tumblr.com/post/16815861438
What is the bronystate symbol anyway?~
why won't my computr do that?
I think, the one at the top
Dawwww, i remember those
that twilight looks SOOOO adorable
:)
Nyria: http://i.imgur.com/Nr7nC.png i think
its what they put on stuff
and then pinkie just being epic
lol
hahahahaha
OMG
Would you people mind if I did a quick survey?
not at all
Okay then
Ok, so Gaia is on a ship over Earth and the closer she gets, the worse her health is. But if the Earth dies, she dies with it
And she's stranded.
When you hear "Gaia" what do you think of? A: Green Titan. B: Video Game. C: Nature. D: Planet?
Greek*
E: final fantasy the bad movie
Now, I think of a crazy person who RP's as Fluttershy rather than saving the world
other than that, C
but also thnk she was depicted as green so..
alright... takin' over..
=____=
D
ohai Kimiko
Hey Shy
/me will stay up a little mroe for a Kimiko stream
i dunno.. Gaia sounds like a weapon to me
Well I'm off for now toot a loo everybody~
later Nyria
Hmm.. No one said Planet
whose idea was it to let Kriza talk in IRC...? =___= owait that was Kriza's idea, and Kriza is an idiot...
therefore it was a bad idea
laters Nyria
She RPs as a pony to pass the time and relate to humans
Ictiv|TheOverlord:
yes?
herp derp chat
if you want me to ask her a question, just ask.
okay
need to reply to tumblr oh god... so many questions..
But does anyone know what Planet I mean under Gaia?
Ictiv|TheOverlord: the concept i have ascociated with 'gaia' is 'planet spirit' if that makes sense
Well that's wrong apparently
but thats just whats in my head, my silly silly head
It's an alien
Ah, not quite in that way :) I meant as a Fictional Planet
Gaia is an alien
Anyone know where is a Fictional Planet called Gaia? And what makes it special?
Anyone?
...Anyone?
no idea
FFIX?
I just call it as something earth element related
nope
/me sighs.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_%28mythology%29 allso my 'planet spirit' guess wasnt far wrong
Final F-ing Fantasy?... You people need some serious Asimov treatment
lol
ohai Phase4
Why does no body read Asimov?
hi Funkballs , your name is random
Ictiv|TheOverlord, can you timewarp over here and blow up that noisy garbage truck? I'm trying to write a piece here.
read suks
*reading
:d
Starflash: Timewarp? No. But I can cast a bubble of silence on it.
reading is for twilight sparkle
i was autocompleting Fleur and your name came up instead
/me casts spell.
That would help.
This all started because there is a person on SL who RPs as Fluttershy who swears she is an alien here to save the Human race from destroying the Earth and killing her lover, Gaia
Did it work?
Yes, It did.
Good
does it lessen the blow if I told you my favorite author is ray bradbury?
For a moment there I was afraid I did the lastt bit off. Could have accidentally sent Penguins into extinction if i get the last bit right
wrong*
IF you guys have an account in SL, come to Trotsdale.
huh, my internet got better
SL?
It probably is because it drove on, but that's probably because that's a more sensical way how my mind would've explained the sudden silence.
Ya, thats where the alien RPs as fluttershy
Davie_Jones: We mean: What is SL?
Second Life
Ah
oh
Oh by the way, you also killed all natural penguins in a hundred mile radius...
= 0 >__>'
No I didnt
That's not what my spell does
If I mess up the last bit then the spell goes to the wrong place
strangely enough your location's magical position is pretty close to the Antartic
That's what that potted flower said
If I cast a silence spell there, the penguins won't be abel to innitiate their mating calls
ergo they won't woo. Ergo: No kids. Ergo: No happy feet 3
That's a blessing
Ergo: happy humanity
Ictiv DOO EET
but then my feet will be sad
was happy feet 2 worth seeing?
Eenope
I remember the first one, it was ok
The first was pretty good i think... Second? Clichéd but not ALL bad
1st one is amusing. 2nd is... average
theyre both cheese
Anyway, the reason why the alien doesn't talk to humans is all the other attemps to talk to them has lead to the government capturing members of her species.
anyone here seen the moviebob review that mentions happy feet 2?
that was funny
Davie_Jones: wait what?
Hellspawn: YOu're saying that if aliens invade we should throw Happy Feet DVD-s at them?
05would you ratehr have me play something else or do something else entirely?
Havne't you beeing paying attention, Phase?
/me would, but /me is /me
i'm in and of myself a minority
I'm talkingto an alien who RPs as fluttershy
I just enjoy watching you do stuff Wrek
Of course Phase4 hasn't paid any attention, he should've been in bed a couple of hrs ago
inb4 that came out a little creeper esk
i got the fluttershy rp bit but that sentence was just lolwut
head to asdfnsoijafs to apfea
I know. But she's so serious about it that I can't help but play along
as a welcome present? why not
my fingers donet ant to work rign
dat noclip
my fingers dont want to work right'
those stari liek things. seems legit
stair'
like'
/me *derp*
Davie_Jones: What if she actually is what she says it is? Should two guys in black suits appear who introduce themselves as letters: Run
Anyway, I told her that if she wants to disable the Government, she just needs to target the satalites and the Ballistic instalations from space, then land in major jpopulation areas.
well its bed time for me
night #BronyState
Oh wait, it's not an alien, Gaia is a Goddess
night Phase4
Davie_Jones: She's a Titan
Mother of all gods and lesser Titans
omg 60s batman theme is catchy...
mate of both Cosmos and Kronos
ok, way wrong about the number of fics of twilight on fanfiction, there's 195,787 of them
Dken2021 good twilight or bad twilight
friends of my mom came over to visit us for 2 days and their son is sitting in my room. im nervous ;_;
I think you know when I say the singular
I think bad twilight
yup
oh god he looked at me
Hellspawn: are they bronies? if they are it's alright
XD
germany is 0.4% bronies
So that would make the chance of an existing fanfic actually being better than the book about 90%, when you don't count any prejudices about the writers in...
he isn't one of those types of kids that are odd is he?
o.o
hes playing nintendo ds
Dken2021... <_< >_> 'odd'
o.o
Killing Spreeeee!!!!!!!!
hes investigating my stuff now, brb
Ok, so Gaia is a Goddess who took mortal form.
wasn't expecting fics of kampfer, but whatever
People used to know of her existance but the humans covered up her existance.
nooooooooo
:D
fk
:O
This is funny
Now she's telling about her religion
05who?
some RP on second life he's talking about
The 'alien' RPing as Fluttershy
he turned out pretty nice. he likes my cameras ^_^
05shameful that some need to turn to religion for comfort
wait wut?
05snacks are much better
exactly what it sounds like, Pie
Or do you prefer Diane?
Keta is good
Wow Wrek. dat interesting religion
It's more convenient though snackbar/market= closer than church
btw is second life still working?
more doom?
Wrek is better than snaks
hahaha
i agree
I'm waiting for her to get bored of it and just drop it.
the explosions look good
is he using any mods?
I was hoping I could be friends with her, but if she keeps this act up, i'll never get that.
05snacks are much better
what
05but yeah as i said, you guys want something else?
skyrim?
:(
Doom on steroids looks better than skyrim
nope
chuck testa
eeeeeyup
:OOOOOOO
:/
fk this looks IMPOSSIBLE :O
i've beat it
sounds like it is boring you Wrek :p
i want him to play skyrim
Well I just cut her off
She just called herself a goddess
who davie
At that point, it stops being a game and it shows that you have a mental problem
HAHAHHHA Davie_Jones........
This person RPing as Fluttershy on Second Life
*facepalm*
It was funny for a while when she called herself an alien, but then she crossed a line
i wish i had Second Life :(
fluttershy wouldnt even say that XD
I was hoping I had made a friend.
It was OOC, ofna
And Second Life is free, Ketam
someone should have recorded that :
what is OOC?
i mean second life
out of character
yeah Davie_Jones i know.. but its too late
too late?
to see that RP
Second Life is like a 3D chat sandbox program
It wasn't an RP
It was an OOC chat in Im
hmmmmmmmm
is it for mac
Yes
hm
Well, Firestorm is. That's one of the viewers

upload the recording on youtube
I have the chat text. I can copy it all and post it somewhere.
he probably wasnt recording
go for it davie
i wanna read it
Nothing to record, it was all text.
GOGOGO!
Find me a forum to post it to
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhh..............
um...
Doesn't thsi channel have a forum?
NO

KetaminaDianePie: same here for the most part, it's just not a island

kinda unoriginal, isn't it?
Wrek! can I post a video link!
a unicorn magic snowball fight would be truly epic
better than creating new "Intos" that might suck

okay
O_O
I will take his silence as a okay
INVISIBILITY!
here is a short video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw9_M8w-N1c
explains the lore
yeah
HA! King Drakar :D!
hahaha
is it a ork?!?
yes it is
Orc's are great in this game
they aren't flourescent green for one
orks are good...... btw goblins ROOOOCKS :D!!!!!!!!!!!
i've got the skyrim theme on my MP3
Viking God Extraordinaire, Dovakhin Dovakhin
lol
lol i saw rathalos's head XD
Wearing magic underwear, Dovakhin, Dovakin
dovahkiin,dovahkiin,for the sake of skyrim
thats what i heard
KetaminaDianePie: but there are no goblins in this game
:( thats bad :(
no it's not
HEY!
they felt REALLY out of place in Oblivion
He's here to kill the dragon, just let him off the wagon
brb biobreak
sorry i dont know Oblivion that well......
well
i dont know about Oblivion at all :D!
name him dovahkiin
You know you want to hame him something obscene, Wrek.
Zporko Wrek!
Zporko is a good ork name :D!
Porkins?
gaz rock?
gas rock?
it was a dragon
LOL
off with his head!
btw where are u from otakon? (if i may ask :))
skyrim yes
at first i thought it said nice and sexy
back
maryland, the middle of the eastcoast in the US
their blind i guess
Why does she ask that?
WE can clearly see it's a damn DRAGON
i know right?
or at least something BIG SCALY and PISSED OFF LOOKING!
y u no use the fluttershy dragon mod? XD
there's a fluttershy dragon mod?
valoreins: you would kill Fluttershy! monster!
otakon: of course i won't.. i'll just run away :p
6_9
05because if i was usign that mod
05i wouldnt be able to kill any dragons
see!
Any chance I can talk to a server admin asap?
I told you!
lol
eeeyup
hmmm
well no crap
they need to mod it so when you give Fluttershy enough brushings, she falls asleep and give you the soul
if only i had skyrim then i would fastly install pony mods
Oh lookie~ I come back and skyrim.
I don't have a computer capable of running it
can you install mods on consoles?
me neither
nope
aww too bad
unless you crack the console
but that would be awkward if i kill fluttershy and what i get is dragon scales and bones...
you can do that?
pisses me off nowadays too
LunaScarlet somepony probably found out some really complicated way to do it...
ofna01: it can be done, but it voids the warranty and if you don't know what your doing it can break your system
makes sense
So ofna, did you read all of the log?
i still cant understand why is this game soo good............
take the sword!
Morrowind started it for me.
yeah davie i read it
KetaminaDianePie: it's the exploration, graphics and the ability to mold your character in various ways
I LOVE the exploration aspect of the ES games
mostly the vastly well made landscapes.
for me that is.
yeah
ON a scale of one to ten, how crazy is she?
Ohai Dashie_Dashie ~
Davie_Jones: who?
9
ohai Starflash~
You've seen crazier?
hiya Starflash
no
yeahhh..... maybe.......... but i think FP doesnt fit RPG that much....... and the lack of multiplayer...........
otakon you were already there when I brb'd. XD
I was?
bloodeh swords
yeah :O
Then why a nine?
I think..
i dunno davie
i guess a 10
owned
RPG MUST be multiplayer in my opinion............
is wrek the one playing?
KetaminaDianePie: MP! not EVERYTHING needs MP nowadays! also FP is fine, how else would you play a exploration focused game?
yeah
Oh btw otakon you've got PonySquare?
no
ok~
I love how Machinima had a vote to see which game is better
This
or The old republic..
you can't compare a Single play rpg to a mmorpg
*facehoof*
maybe ur right................ i just cant stand mainstream games...... and with a customization games (like RPGs) MUST show your character whole time.....
it's like comparing fluttershy with pinkie pie, right?
indeed
KetaminaDianePie: you only really see your character when you go 3rd person
it depends on how the MMORPG is designed
ow damn i fail that sentence
if the MMO is largely single-player with social aspects, that's one thing
oooo
:O!
true
but half the time no one is social
owww
you okay KetaminaDianePie?
so, he's DUAL WEILDING in ROBES?
yesh
which is badass
he's making the squishiest character ever
otakon - i've gone two-hand flames in full heavy metal armor
squishie squishie squishie
it's stupidly effective
MirrorImage: well that's good
that's a Battlemage
Mirror used Noob Move!
Heavy Armor and Magic
its super effective!
It's Super Effective!
third person swich fk me up 6_9
I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT IT!!!
yeah I do miss how you could see your guy in the menu in this though
should have had that armor spell with mage armor skill, you're safe with using that
bear
burn
inb4 ded
valoreins - i used that as well

steal stuff
U can steal in this game?!?
yes
of course your can KetaminaDianePie - it's a Bethesda game
see?
lol
and you can kill normal NPC *evil grin*
in most cases
children you can't, and essential NPCs
my uncle's partner did that
if you go with the imperial on the beginning you dont need to steel from the smith
omg i HAVE to advertise my friends about this game........ they lost faith in this after Fable 2 came out!
and there's a mod that lets you kill children
the blacksmith bumped into him,and his partner cut off his head
loll
choppy choppy wood
05easy cash
so is pickpocketing
im doing this NOW!
05so is your mom
there are much easier ways ^^
if your not in a poor village ofna01
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhh snap
god wrek
did that kid just pull a dagger?
LOL
i think so
nice
everyone had weapons back then
hey you have the mod for killing childrens
well that's one way to get 1000 bounty
wtf
ROFL
how is that shield shape
...
lol
XD
i would grab illusion if i were you
03o.o
why illusion ?
good for assassins
ah
"Papa says I'm too friendly, but you look like a nice person."
*Kill her... she knows too much*
lol
XD
but you look like a nice person *get stabbed*
D:
chop
working in a game omg
chop
you have to work in minecraft
thats why i dont play minecraft
^^
hmph
yes, but that's working to survive
rather than working for gold
you should try minecraft yellow
omg this reminds me when when i play skyrim at college... some people thought i was playing assassin's creed :P
i tried it once
then i played the fraking weekend
depending on your play style, you might as well be valoreins
stab heem
it is just a bit to boring
i was a mage back then, no backstabbing whatsoever
i would just go on a rampage probably
SHUT UP STAAAB
/me suddenly wants to play skyrim
see you later
same
/me trout slaps yellow for not liking minecraft
haha
bb
cya
minecraft is like poniez, onece you start, you can't stop :D
i agree
im making an mansion later todya
hmmmmmmm
omnomnomnomnom I haz butterfinger.
Wrek, you're scaring the girl
well,finishing,i should say
hey tarku
okay now i'm confused, should i play minecraft, or skyrim now?
got the 1.2 snapshot yet?
both
i'll be playing New Vegas in a little while
-___-
aye, I've played it, sticking to 1.1 till mods update tho
you find any ocelots yet tarku?
i'll decide with a coin, heas: skyrim, tail: minecraft
if you like legos valoreins play minecraft.... otherwise play skyrim
spawned in the middle on 50+ lol
keta
minecraft isnt legos
:)
y not?
*facepalm*
does lego's have lava?
Y NOT?!?!?!
WOLFIE
wut?
D:
rawr
i have pet wolves on minecraft
but there is this minecraft lego texture pack XD
hey valo
so minecraft=lego :D
quick question
yea?
:O
i've got a texture pack installed,but it wont show up in the list
....
hahahahahah :D!
Did you save it to the right folder/
?*
so you kill a lady,and start chopping wood?
yeah dashie
odd..
And stripped her!
rofl
oh someone could answer it for you XD.. <never tried texture pack
Randomnerd: Welcome to skyrim.
Meow
ah
thx thugh valo
lulz
AVAST YE BANDITS.
i have come to steal ye gold
arrr
kills 2 bandit,starts mining
welcome to skyrim
lol pansy swings
skyrim logic
Like a boss.
Fun fact: You can drag bodies. Only creepier thing than killing a lady and then starting to chop wood would have been to drag her neck on the wood chopping plank and start chopping
00,10Morning all
dead body
mornin Sumica
Ictiv
thats pretty creepy
mornin sumi
00,10Wrek start a new game
he's still telling him to keep a lookout while fighting an intruder XD
he did sumi
ofna01: Tell me about it. I had to deal with it creeping into my head. I'm starting to develop a Lyra syndrome now that she's not here
hey Sumica!
There must be one!
he just did Sumica :P
i can om nom nom liquids
like a boss
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFoKeCRIXTQ&feature=endscreen im going to learn this move when i get my butterfly knife
Minecraft.... Skyrim..... i just wonder how Starcraft map editor is.........
like a baws
twirl a kife,like a baws
burn,baby,burn
okay i'm off playing minecraft, then skyrim, bye everypony :)
valor
bye val
wish i could play minecraft with ya
Heve fun valoreins :D!
ow
a "butterfly knife"(?)................
think this is legos?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZFNSsB58YY
yeah keta
otherwise known as a balisong
/me swings his butterfly knife
you dont swing it
you twirl it
owwww
k
you never seen a butterfly knife?
i HAVE a butterfly knife.....
im playing with it right now
What if the world was like a clock
mine should be in friday keta
its a training one,though
a training one :O?!?!?!?!
with a plastic blade?
Intrecate and perfectly balanced to work away without stopping.
no
not a plastic blade
/me clears throat, straightens tie and looks up seriously.
its metal,except dulled,so i dont chop off my finger
Where-a be yo Kamma-junk!?
then with a rubber band on the blade?
oooooowwwwwwwww
/me pouts and walks off
oh no Davie_Jones!
cut yourself keta?
first times yes.....
Davie_Jones: I have bad news. The world IS like a clock.
but it was like........
i wanna be like the spy off TF2
uhhhhh......
OMG
*ahem* gentlemen?
10 years ago
:O
Well, then what if the ponies a long time ago kept poking at the clock? Making winters a little bit shorter, or making it rain where it shouldn't rain, ect.
ofna01: MMMMPHHHHHHMMMM!
im getting old :(
What would eventually happen to that clock?
what overlod
you silly..................... the world IS a clock :D!
Davie_Jones: Their actions would technicalyl be part of the clock
The clock would still function without them being there.
Oh but that's not true
guys,im too tired to think
If they wouldn't be there, it wouldn't have reached the exact point it did
stop talking smart
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TcddoSCB8I
What?
it would be a diffrent point entriely
Davie_Jones: Think of it this way:
You can say that the Earth would work perfectly without humans no?
But there would be a lot of things very different
it wouldnt
a lot of speices would still exists.. a lot of species would NOT exists
Davie_Jones: But it would be completely different
really..... How couldnt you compare minecraft to Lego?!?!? (im not talking about lego system or so)
I'm talking about changing the rules.
Indee
That's the problem. You can't change the rules of a clock without buildign a new clock
As in actually making the orbit of the planet change to extend summer.
you can' take out a cog and put in a smaller one
Davie_Jones: That is still part of the clock
that is not much different than making a species extinct
it LOOKS bigger
Exactly. The ponies kept poking at the gears and springs to make the clock change. Eventually.... it broke.
but in an infinite universe its not bigger at all
/me trout slaps overlord and davie
now both of ya,shut up!
Nuuuu
/me dramaticly falls in slowmo from the traut slap
ofna01: But we're having a fun, phylosophical conversation!
/me cant beleive that worked
You mean 'filly'sophical
Our High School teachers would be so proud!...Well rather indifferent... but you know what i mean!
/me laughs at davie falling slowly
"fillyspohical"... Okay I can't talk serious with this man.
/me turns to ofna01.
What are your thoughts on paralel dimensional multiverse theory?
/me walks away
The point I was getting to is the reason why the ponies have to change the seasons, raise the sun and moon and guide the birds is because they broke the world.
/me takes out butterfly knife and twirls it
/me puts on his razerback
Davie_Jones: The everfree forest changes its on whether though
now,you guys can shut up,or i can demonstrate how to backstabe
There are still parts that function normally, however those are isolated and are exceptoins
/me closes knife and puts it in my pocket
Like people who can survive from a headshot
Because ponies live in a world where everything depends on eachother to survive.
I think they don't HAVE to, they just developed an economy that needs the seasons to be perfectly orderly
In my opinion only Equstria works like this
thats it
What do you base your thoughts on that?
and not becasue it can't do other wise, but because they need it like that
/me pulls out huntsman and aims at davie
/me pulls out his flamethrower
Davie_Jones: First of all: Their concern was not "Spring won't come" but "Spring will come late"
/me cloaks
HEY!
secondly, a single forest won't live normally on a planet with a broken ecosystem
You mean they'll be late for spring
love and tollerance you sillyes :D!
/me trout slaps keta
Davie_Jones: yes
stop beeing fillysophical and look @ the skyrim dude, he's in deep shit with the thief
not anymore
* :[
oh he's dead
I just got finished watchingg that episode. it was about them being late for spring. As in teh town in relation to the rest of the nation.
yes
/me trout slaps davie over and over
/me airblasts Ofna away
/me calls in OFC
hehehe
OFC?
mfw the thief nearly killed the only hope for the world

HAAAXX!
/me throws a monitor at Ofna
nope
05only got one thing to say
/me uses deathstar.
/me matrix dodges and airblasts back at davie
deathstar ftw
Good morning everyone :3

Hey TOY_PON3

mornin TOY_PON3
Ohai everypony

If that is true, thry do they still have to arrange bad storms?
"Bad Storms"?
Remember the sleep over episode?
/me stabs davie
There isn't such a thing as a "Bad Strom"
Hey Jim, Ictiv|TheOverlord, ofna01, and KetaminaDianePie

>.> Dashie_Dashie didn't say hi back..
i used to be an adventurer like you,then i took an arrow to the knee
I was just refreshing my page ^^
sounds weird but is true
he will pay
They weren't tearing it down to make it stronger.
and hi to you too KetaminaDianePie
hi dar jim
They were tearing them down to keep the branches from killing ponies during the storm.
:D!
Hi ofna01
hey keta
Didn't you watch the episode?
plots evil plan
I did
hows it going with your knife?
Who's playing?
Applejack said that word for word.

I know
Did he start a new game?
yep
Orc
...
im got bored..... and i sent it back to my closet
00,10So what sort of game play is this run through gonna be wrek?
....
That doesn't change the fact that storms are needed, come with wind and that tearing down those branches makes the tree more healthy
keta
Hey Sumica
you should gimme the knife
00,10Sup

/me 's knife accidentally flies out of his hand and hits stallion in the forehead
too slow
If money is made from wood, is Fluttershy money?
yes

/me wonders what this game is
Fluttershy makes best 100 dollar bill
That explains her shyness

Hat: Yeah
Hat: but it logs your login, and when you login successfully it will display it as a failed log in
if this happens when you didn't do it, you can request a network ban for the given ipadress

What's the difference between a successful and failed log in if either change my name to Hat which is registered
i have no clue
Hat: Successful: YOu give your password. Failed: you mess up your password
I'm gonna watch Suited for Success

I only put in a bit of the pass then the text field changed focus, am I technically borrowing this username from myself?

Davie_Jones: Hey-hey-hey It's okay to read Jay it's okay mate! Let's rejoye with the boys in the Jay way?

if you were wondering
05howto refference LMJ when drawing rarity: add a thin thin almost not even sisible teeth line on her flank.
^
You seem well versed in refferencing him by the way.
is this some Star Wars?
That silly 'sleepy' Twilight and her silly book for example
KetaminaDianePie: Ref Faction actually
05I am very educated in his arts
owwwwwww
Wrek: he just threw a huge tantrum earlier about him hating "Jay Naylor"'s guts. I don't know why though, was there some sort of history I'm missing?
Spacecraft FPS are even cheaper to program then normal FPSs
Jay Naylor is weird
Jay Naylor is a furry artist
That's a moot point. he's weird even among furries
I know what he is. But his non-adult-adult comic is pretty good in my opinion
Ictiv - agreed
hey grampa!
05to be honest
If you don't mind being flattened by anvils thoughout the entire story
05i could care less about him as a person
05but i like his arts
05and art is the only thign i care about

Isn't Jay Naylor a Starcraft character

What is it?
I actually just commented on that, Wrek
Left a protip
Shoot things that blow up :the video game
They should make a movie about that!
05monfang
05added to stalk list
Yes
its like starfox
yay
its got planes and tanks
DO A BARRELROLL!
you should see the debate I got into over someone saying that 'Ditzy Doo' never existed
:)
maaaaaan i sure love StarFox Assault
KetaminaDianePie: Barrelrolls are so 80s--- Do a SwaggerRoll!
:)
Funfact, the Barrel Rolls in starfox aren't barrel rolls
Rick Rolls are only beaten by Barrel Rolls and Swaggerrolls
of course theyr not!
Davie_Jones: Wait... Someone said Ditzy Doo generally didn't exist or that "Derpy" was never her?
a barrelroll is a navy torture
Let me get the quote..
Ictiv - there's still general arguments whether Ditzy Doo from Winter Wrap Up was the Derpy we know
Jim: DoN't forget about Dick Rolls. (As in Richard Rolls)
MirrorImage: I know
wat
davie
how are barrelrolls in starfox not barrelrolls?
One thing at a time.
They're not in a barrel! Duh!
First the Ditzy do thing
its like an airleon roll right?
^ That
Now can I get to it?!
thought so
yesh
First, I said: "Ditzy Doo used to be her name, however there was so much fan support to Derpy Hooves, that they changed it."
He countered: "They never officially showed Ditzy Doo."
maaaaaaaaaan Starfox Assault is best Starfox :))))))
lolno
Achievement Unlocked
yes
05oh look, another mag by slugbox is out apparently
After being stunned for a few moments, I named one instance of her existance. "Episode with the Pinky Senses. When Twilight is in her wheelchair and is watching Pinky, after he is hit with all the stuff, the camera pans up with a grey-blue pegasis pony looking embarrassed. That's Derpy Hooves formally known as Ditzy Doo."
/me goes to order
Second best roll of the world: http://www.lfgcomic.com/page/144
- Blew something up
05DONT JUDGE MEEEEEH
dude,game informer said it was like putting gas on pancakes
ruined something great
Am I wrong at any point thus far?
daaaaamn dont trust reviews you silly!
no
i played it
Wrek: Why would I judge you in an infinite universe where blood sacraficing people have equally as much proof of being right about god, as people who retreat to mountains and live in silence?
Davie_Jones the issue with that particular point is that Derpy wasn't recognized in the show until episode 15
Well it wasn't good enough for him. He countered: "She was never officially called Ditzy Doo in the show. They referred to a Ditzy Doo in Winter Wrap Up, but it was never shown to be Derpy."
as it was, when the fan hype over it came out, Lauren had Derpy changed in episodes that hadn't yet been sent to Hasbro for broadcast
Episode 15 was the first of such episodes; Winter Wrap Up was printed and out the door before Derpy received formal acknowledgement like that
on everyone’s Derpy love."
soooooo is Derpy a boy in the cartoon then?
eenope
Davie_Jones - and again, the name Ditzy was already in production by the time we came up with Derpy
is a she?
also, suddenly RAWRity
we noticed that
KetaminaDianePie: She is a She... Only voice actress didn't know that
:)
though it will be curious to see what comes of this with that "backlash" that Hasbro has now been informed of
wait...is the Derpy/Ditzy discussion STILL going on?
right, Mirror, but here we have Lauren stating that 'she can be here if we ever need to show her'.
but she hadnt daughters
*her
yeah rawr
Is there a stream, Or am I lagging?
.....
His final counter was: "Not in an episode, doesn't matter. That pony was never explicitly shown to be Ditzy Doo."
...HOW is taht still going on. They used her name. Game Over. Ditzy Doo is some other pony.
"The streeeeeeam is oooooon"
RAWRity - we don't know that for certain
DO A BARREL ROLLL!
"Derpy" seems rather short for an MLP name; it could just be a nickname
Basicly, it is only canon to this weirdo if they show her face and give her name. I'm willing to bet this guy won't believe that Luke Skywalker was married because it wasn't in the movie.
MirrorImage: She was Called Derpy. We have literally never been given ANY indication that her name was Ditzy, or that Ditzy had ANYTHING to do with her in any way.
Her full name is Derpy Hooves.
Davie_Jones: Luke Skywalker was Married?
In the books
Ah
Had two kids, one turned to the dark side.
the whole episode btw is about Derpys "daughter" :D
spoiler, btw
Okay
Which game is streaming?
Guys! Guys! One of my friends came out the stable today!
For a moment I thought that in the past
That would have been weird
seriously globe?
Globetrotter: is that what we're calling it now?
That's nice Globetrotter.
Cool Globetrotter ^^
RAWRity he's now a brony
Spike is voiced by a girl?
yes
Davie_Jones: I think
I thought that was just called Joining the Herd
He's a brony not a homosexual just for clairity
welcome to the herd rawr
im the same way globe
Yeah, probably need a different comparison Globetrotter.
not gay but still a Brony
RAWRity - Joining the Herd; Coming out of the Stable; yatta yatta yatta
is this "red faction something" ?
Because I literally didn't know which of the two you were going for.
1,3good morning everypony :)
Good idea Lasharus
Yes. Most males in shows animation are voiced by females, yes.
RAWRity: Coming out of the stable is more like coming out of a closet. When he was in the herd already but not officialyl
Morning kirz. :)
like Burt Simpson.................
I bet it is because guys don't want to be assosicated with a girl's show.
And which game is this?
ohai kirzstryfe
for instance, Phil and Lil from Rugrats had the same VA.
Thank you Ictiv
Red Faction I believe
Ah.

05if its twilight, throw it my way
05<3
;_; I can't pick a single pony, It would hurt everypony's feelings.
Duly noted Dismo.
I know what you mean Dismo, I also love all of them
I just feel I identify most with Twilight. :P
;/
I enjoy Rarity's scenes/jokes the most.
meh
she doesnt really joke that much
btw on the manes.......... Pinkie Pie is the best.........
mostly thanks to Tabitha doing a fantastic job with her voice. "I know where you live!"
No Pinkie Pie no MLP fandome
*fandom(?)
yeah we had enough wwith cupcakes
I disagree
Pinkie ftw Woooh!
Ok, can a girl explain this to me.
Any girls here, per chance.
HEY!
05shoot
Or feminate guys
05ask away
im not talking about cupcakes FUUUUUUCK!
Why didn't the girls like their new dresses?
Spike is the same actor as Shampoo?
What madness is this?
They look great to me. Why do they look.... turned off by them?
Spike is Omochao........
05I'd answer that liek this: ever been drawing?
05like
05you have this iamge in your head
05and how awesome it is
05but when you draw it its rubbish?
KetaminaDianePie - as in same VA?
Oh deary me...
Wrek mah boy.
05kina like that
pew pew pew
Davie_Jones: 2 explanations. 1: They had built up their own expectation on what it should be, and when the real deal didn't match up with what they'd expected, they decided they didn't like it. or, alternatively: They have really bad taste.
dunnno if its the same :D!
Wrek, I have a question.
...
05shoot
RAWRity makes more sense
i just LOVE to hate him :D!
I'd hit all the girls with my cane if I was there.
RAWRity: Considering what their 'vision' dresses ended up being, I'm leaning towards bad taste.
00,10have no idea how to use this thing
05Sumica
05teach me nao
05skype
05xD
1,3lol
On most clients, when you get highlighted, the message is colored. So if you were to use a client, would you mistake said message for using a color?
FFFFFFFFFFFFF-
That noise.
05...what?
Well, for example..
If you were using XChat, and I said "Wrek," the message would be red.
Even if I didn't color it.
1,3that's only in your client
05xchat sucks
05use mIRC
1,3^
Hell yeah mIRC! :P
Nah XChat master race.

I'm sorry.

mIRC is not free btw :(
oooh, just found the smooth tool on illustrator, it's like a magic cleaning steam rion
the internet's been around for nearly 20 years, yet we still haven't found a better Chat tool than IRC.
Because I think it's time for a little creative genocide of the master raice, in that case. :P

well, I'm off to get lunch. see you all later.
master race?!?!?!?!?
05also xcanox

WUT?
Yes?
05that is what differs you from me, your choice for words.
Interesting.
BYE RAWrity
And that is what differs you from me Wrek. Your choice OF words.
owwww
That was the most relevant thing I've had remarked to me all day. :P
(Yes, I'm a sod :P)
WAIT!
05that is a matter of nationality xD
How do ponies know what FRENCH o Cature is?
No it's not :P

They don't, it's fancy
Davie_Jones - because there's a Pony France?

I'm an anarchist.

Little girl, does your mama know you're out tonight?
(No, I can't speak the Old Germanic languages. I can barely translate them)
05så svenska kan vara lite förståeligt i alla fall?
And if she did, would she die of frieght just to know you're out with me?

So apparently Rarity's cat has 'ugly' senses or something
/me smacks kirzstryfe upside the head.
And if you do, does it change your mind?

Or will you love me all the time?
Wonder what it says about her not liking Rarity?

Oh dear.
okay
hold on
Wrek, you KNOW this is going to end badly. :P
05hush Lasharus beforei double dip you in ym sauce
The spell wouldnt exist if Twi was the only one who could cast it , there have to be other unicorns with comparable magical abilities . Yes she's a prodigy but that doesnt mean others cant get there with work!
When Rarity was a filly, I believe she hovered when he horn was dragging her to the jems.
What flavour is that sauce? Chilly? Salad topping?
I'd hesitate to use Pound Cake as an example simply because of the age (as in baby)
I still have no idea about this sauce, and I would prefer to remain ignorant. Hushing now.

No guarantee that if you ponified yourself that you yourself would also have that level of magic.
No equal , but a better
the co-op demo is apparently only on LIVE and PSN

Celestia and Luna don't count, they're alicorns TrixieMuffin.
Very true EspyLacopa, but I'd be happy with a modicum of magic and the ability to study it.
05cant you jsut send me the danged .torrent?
kirzstryfe: Technically... Discord qualifies as everything that is imaginable and also what is not. So he qualifies as a pony and Twilight's equal

Discord is a Q.

it's official ofc
or at least I hope it is
05probably not
that site date is from NOv.23 of last year
05cause its a bloody torrent
hmm
1,3and then otakon's computer gets jacked by hacker torrent
I'm not torrenting it
I'm dling it on Xbox Live
1,3then your xbox may explode
and I picked up Bastion for 600 points too
1,3but let's face it, that's a possibility anyways
yeah
it's a newer one though
and I have a warranty on it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgkoiFwI5eM
Wrek: I did a quick google search and saw somewhere that demo comes on January 31st
I can't even download torrents Wrek. :P
so it should be official
torrents r fur noobs
But I keep looking for you
If I try and get caught on our network (which is likely), I can get shutdown for about a month.
Not really worth it.
/me slaps ofna01 around a bit with a large trout
fishmalk?
/me blocks trout
1,3food time, back in a bit
/me pulls out butterfly knife
:((( mfw i cant use piratebay cause my government blocked pirate bay a year ago
That's aweful!
Ah I take it back. Bad news Wrek: Apperently there is no official release date for PC demo whatsoever
Everyone seen the Art of the Dress episode, right?
05mhmm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IUjtHf76wM
What is the cutie mark on the designer supposed to be?
05I'll give it 1-2 days
05if there is a "leaked demo"
05that works on PC
I can't see if it's supposed to be a fan or a color.. swatch. Wahtever it's called
05it will be on PB
hey Wrek
found another one

thx otakon
oh np
the only problem is I thought there was a pc demo out too
I wonder if there is a mental condition that someone can have that makes them seek out acceptance in sociaty?
but the co-op demo only came out for xbox and Psn
Davie_Jones: ofc
Davie_Jones: I think it's supposed to be a fan
isnt it called normal beheaviour?
Davie_Jones: eeup it's a fan
Ah, thank you.
Wait... what?
Jim, what are you talking about?
You were talking about if anyone could have a mental condition that made you want to be accepted by society
normal behawwww(owww damn)
and most people do want to be accepted, because that's what we do to survive, it's instincts
^
Cool, I connected to Bronystate through Adium. I'm a l33t hacker now.
Tovler: I read that as Alduin
well
humans work on instinct too
No more eating and watching KIng Of the Hill youtube poops for me,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwgGfjVnvdc&feature=related
what is a man but an animal with different instincts?
You'll be 1337 when you log on through the first born of the time god
Enough talk, have at you!
I know many humans who want to stand out in the crowd.
but we usually use our intelligence to override our instinct
Good morning, everypony.
ohai Kira_Pony_Yamato
Jim: Have at who?
It was a response to MirrorImage 's Castlevania reference
Moaaaarning.... wait moarning?
I want my Kammerjunk...
hiya Kira_Pony_Yamato
Jim - i made a Castlevania reference?
So, how was the L4D2 stream last night? Did the mods make it out alive?
"What is a man but a pile of miserable secrets"
I might have overanalyzed it
yeah... i've never played Castlevania
might've heard that line and pulled from it a bit, but it wasn't an intentional reference
Eek.. Did I kill the chat with my stupid remarks? :(
/me considering getting a private pilot's license, if I can find another job...
No, I just stopped talking.
Damn Obama...

Ahh
KetaminaDianePie this song totally fits my mood right now thank you :)
:) np
Haven't played L4D in a long time now
i just hope im not gonna be banned for posting yt links :)
I left about when the mods got to the extraction point, so I have no idea as to whether they made it out alive or got nommed to death
well
who are you talking too?
KetaminaDianePie: your fine, if in doubt ask the mod
anyone that saw the L4D2 stream last night
00,10That was me, trying to set it up so wrek can talk with out LS
Youtube links are fine unless the mods have said they're not
usualy during stream nights they don't like youtube
omg apacalypse pony fanfic! I should write one :P
comedy of course
Agreed, Morty
but im usually too shy to ask someone something o_o"
Monty - Fallout: Equestria - Old Horse Shoes (Old World Blues)

lol
I like that idea
If I was any good at typing, I'd try my hand at a MLP/Gundam crossover fic.
but it's just a pun
yeah, i know
you should make sure you have something interesting to write about

Globetrotter: Wrek does.
Pretty good stuff, but I hardly use shouts :(
Maybe Yol Toor Shul
Wrek: Spam the bad guy with the staff of magnus
it makes the battle SOOOO much easier
Is wrek doing the skyrim'ing?
make sure to spam the crap out of the guy with the staff
He uses magic or empty handed attack styles
Tilda disable the dragon if you want. His corspe may annoy you...
and the staff drains his magica
not yet
during the battle
NOT YET!
I never got this battle. The staff works half the time...
ok NOW SPAM HIM!@
spam the guy

Does Wrek use alchemy?
Pyrexo - no reason not too when it increases the resale cost of your daggers from 10 septim to 300+
13except TONS of potions you never use
Ah, It's just i haven't seen him use Poisons yet, but he has enchanting & smithing by the Ledengary gear :) Thanks
oh alchemy... durr
Can't you put the dog on a skateboard?
wut
the only reason i end up using alchemy is because i pick up EVERY ingredient on the roads
And launch sad skateboard off a cliff.
said*
Why is the game even named Skyrim
k im back
Tis my first day on BronyState :D definetly coming back for the movie night
Welcome back
The world is called skyrim
cause it takes place in skyrim
Because it is based in Skyrim
Welcome here Pyrexo c:
or the country zone place
I see.
Thank you Radu ^^
I ran out of top ramen:'(
That's a pretty lazy way to name a game...
Gesundheit
i find alchemy boring
After the dog gets you there, do you kill it?
so annoying to find right ingredients
XD
Buuuut the layout for all of Tamriel is there too...meaning if you were to "tcl" you could run to Morrowind
Hmm. Dogs have excellent memory.
Or so i heard is a gaming magazine
i think Baskerville was just huge and rabid
Wrek is the first dual wielder I've seen :O Don't you miss blocking?
they die too quickly for it to be necessary
I use heal and 1h weapon
I cope really well
Ah of course :)

Proud to be british ;)
Fazana what does distinguish it from MineCraft, other than being 2D?
It's not be creative
Wait, you can talk to dogs now?
it's more go on adventure, kill stuff, find stuff, get equipment, go to hell, kill Bosses
And I have to say, it's motr addicting
Hmmm...may pick it up on steam then :P
If you do, if you ever set up a server, I'll give you some equipment to start off
I LOVE THIS LINE

Anyone know how to fix the colours on adobe illustrator so that they portray pony colours correct

Decided what we're going to see yet?
I found out about this website by "BronyState reacts to Derpy talking"
When the new episodes air, things are just off the bat
like 5k+ people viewing the stream
Oh yeah
Last ep, on saturday was at about 5k viewers, and it lagged quite badly
I didn't lagg last saturday
I didn't lag either
yea i had no lag
Didn't lag
the only lag i ever have is when i try to join the stream late
So we all watch the new episodes together?
Me neither
I won't be though
Pretty much
I'll be at my friends place
Cool :D I love fresh reactions
Which sword do you take: The blue one, or the red one?
trap!
I'll be busyr acing brumbrums rather than watching ponies
dohoho, dat trap
lol you were tricked
But, the new ep stream is more than just Bronystate
The red one. Fire is better than frost

/me saves SuperBrony64|AFK from his class and brings him into the real world. :3
Take the blue sword - The game ends, and you wake up in a bar filled with beer and coffee. You take the red sword, you stay in Skyrim, and I'll teach you how long this trip is.
Red Sword
Yaes?

Wise choice, young man
Actually both, Wrek Dual wields...

Reminds me of Funnyjunk ^^
mind you, I haven't been that active here lately
or at least, less active than I usually am
Why does the book die?
Do you eat it or something?
Legend of Kammerjunk feels clichéd a bit... let be try and find anotehr title to the documentary we'll be making
I'm not as active recently either

Globetrotter Pyrexo Fazana: ohai there, havent seen you before

/me hugs ScootaChicken
Cello there
I've been here since... mid november I think?
ohai LunaTheBeloved
Oh yes. Dragons.
Hey Phase4
Anyone want to hear a funny little story about dragons?
My hair is on fire! My hair is on fire! My hair is on fire!
Dragonkiin. Dovaborn.
my first movie night was Iron Man but I didn't start really showing up until a couple weeks later
ohai Phase4
Ictiv yes.
Good!
You shall have one
http://derpy.me/bronystatebacklog << good way to see how long you've been here
/me pulls up armchair.
fire away Ictiv
dohoho fire
My first Film I watched was Alice in wonderland, which was this weekend
Fire! Good choice for it happened to a good little mage
thank god for Shizuka....
I wasn;t intrested in the film, but talking to the bronies online was fun :P
13what now?
13oh
13^-^
This mage went by the name of Ictivion Goka, and was indeed the archmage of Winterhold!
Speculation time!
Revenge of the nerds? :O heard that was great
indeed
Who do you think they'll pull out of their hats for the third villan?
Looking forward to it :P
Now, many responsiblities sit with the position of Archmage, but spenind time to actualyl work... Not among them!
21-st of october is one of the first movies i saw here
This one Ictivion jsut went on adventuring
At this point, we probably will never hear from Derpy again I'd assume.
…Ouch
Not until like 10 episodes
I hope we will :( She's great and I like the voice
10,02kirzStolenBySB is a silly filly :3
He would walk down a street? Dragon attacks city, he kills dragon. "Yay our hero!" He's smiling and all, goes into inn to have a beer after Dragon killing.... "That'll be 20 gold"
Noobs in their homes
"Dude, I literarily saved your life a minute ago! What about a free beer"?
"That'll be 20 gold... Sir"
20 GOLD?!? For mead? Better Be Black Briar...
It was indeed
Recession in Skyrim...
Better be the good stuff
but that is not the point
Davie_Jones :O. Here: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/
Argonian ale
after some quick googleing, i've been here sence september 17, when s2 started
00,10Nice singing wrek
While drinking a fantastic idea came to him!
How about I find me a wife?
I've been a brony since 20th september :)
hmmm, my stream died
again
brb, refreshing
My house gets dusty, my robes need to be kept out of bugs' way
a wife would do positively good
Ok, we got an actor, but what will he play?
did you just summon ovakiin again?
Davie_Jones I was only speculating, I doubt they have him.
So he takes a little stroll down to the chapel of Mara and buys a necklace
Nah Kest is sooo delayed o.o
mighty fine necklace it is too! Gold and jeweled and all around neat
First, we had a Aliucorn who lost her way ala the Protagle Son story.
So then, what does he do?
Yeah Wrek get married :D
Riften
Beat him to it :D
00,10yeah I am sure it is
why do I imagine Wrek as being an incredibly abusive husband...
Second, we had the embodiment of Chaos in direct controdiction to the Elements of Harmony which if this was a story towards boys or even teens would be a recuring villan.
Well first he goes into a dungeon filled with a couplle hundered undead, gets covered in rigor mortis then crawls out
00,10multytasking and all
probably because I've always assumed he looks like the ROSMT guy
So third......
He dusts himself down just fine becasue what is a little undead flesh for an arch mage, am I right?
Don't Breylna Maron -.- She likes me...
Don't marry
ohai Sumica
:D
00,10ohhi
Nevermind that. Onto marrying then, the mage says
Go there Wrek when you're done with what you're doing now
Sumica ^_^
Wuld *Move* Nah Kest
Kammerjunk!
¬.¬ I hate it...
Kammerjunk: Hi
StickySyrup!
He quickly hurries home to the Academy, trying to do a little herbing while thinking "who should we marry?"
hey ScootaChicken
What stone has he got?
00,10Doing my ToR stuff
ohai Kammerjunk
Hey! Let's highlight your hair!

but I'm in the middle of a story
Kammerjunk: we were just talking about you
Hey it' Kammerjunk
Orly?
I'm really at a loss...
We were talking about you
What did I do now?
The legend lives!
Kammerjunk, we were also talking about Ictiv's singing
Is there a villan from the prior three generations they could bring back?
So now this beautiful Dark Elf woman comes up.... "You're looking to marry?"
"The Legend of Kammerjunk", your documentary
ScootaChicken: Im not staying long, got my fan fic to write. R u coming to the Brony meetup in london on the 4th?

I can't make a Gif with gifsoup. I twon't let me add text

Keeps saying it's for premium members
...i love that song, and it was my first couples song... i charmed my whole school gaining popularity, and you dare chat me saying "ugh, THAT song"?
damn
might have to manually add the text in the frames....... or find something else.... or hear from someone that knows it better
~50h is my max
=_=
and that happens rarely
bah
when i was living with my ex-friend raising his kids
isa glitch wreck look around
my roomate played it everytime though, so I heard it a few too many
there was a point i didn't sleep for 6 days
Who's streaming this?

Cavy: Wrek is
Oo. Fun.
Wrek, you should go shoot some Guards in the Knee.

no room
Egh... I don't even~
altair
oh lawd you read it didn't you
i'm in a incomplete basement bathroom
it's 6ft by 7ft
you could fit a small one perhaps
i'd have to cut the drain pipes that are in the floor
the one i sleep on is no longer than 6ft
...
oh
Sinestro time?
it's a incomplete bathroom
well
it has another issue
inb4 He kills everybody
the basement leaks
so nothing can be directly on the floor
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/95e63abf-16ac-4164-a117-904f0ad86aac.png
i have quite abit of stuff pinned to the walls
to avoid the floor
Wow, I can't believe I missed that the first time.
v.v
Ya'll remember when Twilight literally got up on a soap box?
Dken2021: By Celestia, you're right!
ohgod not that kid...
i assume you mean the walls leak
not the ceiling?
the Pinky Sense episode?
yep
the room next to this one in the basement
has a wall that leaks badly
I never noticed that before
when it rains it's not fun
luckly it's winter atm
Ooh, did I come back to see Wrek killing innocent people and sucking their souls?
