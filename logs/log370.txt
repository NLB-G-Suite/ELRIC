Oh dear
I've found it
I wasn't sure whether to laugh at their obliviousness, rage at their shallowness or be ashamed of being in that age group.
not trying to defend them but they were only shown the intro
I'm completely oblivious! "I'm well aware!"
hey Luna
But I doubt it'd matter.
Hi
Do want.
and now I am here
But you can't have been that closeminded, then, since you realised that oh dear, this show is absolutely amazing.
Before I watched MLPFIM, I used to hate it.
I didn't.
I just scrolled past the threads on /b/.
That is awesome
It is.

brb
Oh wait, I just realised something
allcaps time.
I DO NOT DISAGREE
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

09,01SRW Z2 - World Destruction Chapter
sound is a little bit rough
09,01yeah that's due to it coming from a PSP

dat rider kick
ok thanks
09,01that is, Low Defense, "realistic weapons", high evasion
09,01"Super Robots" are high defense, flashy moves, low evasion...basically tankier
inb4 crit
09,01EVAs are considered Hybrids, it's a huge debate
I don't even know what's going on anymore.
ok
09,01and Proto: I'm playing
oh ok
heyo
09,01same.
the fights are kinda cool
09,01you can turn them off but what's the fun in that
He got ripped apart, and survives it
then comes together again
09,01SRW LOGIC.
O_e
*Mind....blown*
oh I forgot that it's Oh, Japan~ time

Seems legit
Airplane got blasted
09,01DEFINITELY.
09,01hot blood.
09,01that's the point.
The point is cool fight scenes it seems
09,01I really gotta stream Getter
only seen gurren lagann and gaogargai
Oh Japan~
No.
oh
Suddenly, face
y no one die yet?
Rapeface
09,01this is the fight against the four generals (as in the movie)
ok
09,01after this comes Teppelin
09,01Gurren-Hen
if this is in the gurrenn universe, how did the other mechs get there?
inb4rapeface
09,01the stories are all interconnected
09,01yeah I choose the attacks
There's 4 options
good after-morning people
thanks for telling
09,01more, it all depends on the mech
Hi

7 hours until 24 hours remaining
Yeah
05yey

/)
00,10I see gunmen this must be srwx2
It most certainatly is.
00,10Morning all
do u need to know much about the other series to know whats going on
No, just Japanese
*crash* BOOM
lemme guess, mine little pony?
Jiggle....-_- Oh japan/
00,10was trying to get build craft to work.
I want a Techniks server
oh boy, buildcraft....
09,01BIG O

09,01SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTAIMU
00,10Dynasty warriors + Ponies.

Haha
09,01being awesome
:)
00,10I am saddend by the lack of gekostate here
09,01but that's just fabulous and not awesome
00,10Getter crotch lazor
09,01yeah I have
gurren laggan is also involved
ok
00,10oh movie nervash
is it just like every mecha ever crammed in one?
00,10more or less
09,01yeah but with a coherent and incredibly enjoyable plot (we can't understand boo hoo)
Because that's kind of overkill
has this series had EVA's in it
inb4 crit
i dont understand the combat...
:D
Me neither, but its okay
ok thanks
09,01and the worst part is SRW is semi-canon to the EVA canon
how is it semi canon
Again pinged by the Canon Monster.
Client: Y U PING ME WHEN "CANON" IS SED?
Man i really need something to do
09,01and Anno wrote several of the SRW scenarios involving EVA
wth?
dai gurren
09,01not that I know of, EVA is an interesting case because SRW might be canon to it
ok
oh i actually know this one
its uh
shit
09,01KYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODAIIIIIIIII GATTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI
09,01or "Sibling Combination"
Oo
10? really?
TTGL?
or some graphic novel variation?
here the overkill again
oh
09,01yeah least damage you can take is 10
ok
is that it?
the animations sure are stunning
hello everypony

09,01Burning isn't in this SRW. I use it in the games that has it
09,01you should try SRW J, it got translated

/me is thinking on learning Japanese
Tons Of Machines (T.O.M)
Amnesia isn't scary
09,01otakon: SURE PROMISE.mp3
Paranormal Activity is scary (only the first part)
See, this is where it's subjective. I didn't find Paranormal Activity scary.

Yeah. Dusty sort of threw out the "I am the manliest man ever and I like MLP"
This is Equestria's aircraft hangar
*Enter otakon's beard training montage*
Dusty is wrong though
The manliest man ever is Armstrong
and he saw Ross'
Well, he is our representation of "you can be a man and like MLP"
You best start doing beard pushups
Its kind of odd to see someone step up and say "I'm proud to be a brony" out in the open like that

Brotherhood is three years old.
00,10brotherehood is based more on the manga
00,10oh look eqd already issueing a retraction

odd is an understatement
Thank godness
lol @ EQD
especially that movie
I guess hes not one.....oh well
00,10Morty
Ohhhh. See I don't care about the manga.
Brotherhood was made near the end of the manga's run and follows it faithfully.
00,10it's um.....20 I think
HAH
Boot to the head.
But Brotherhood is the recommended version of the two, eh? They both tell identical stories?
Mostly.
NO
not at all!
Like I said, the old FMA didn't follow the manga because it got ahead of the series.
00,10they are close till around ep14
And....didn't do a good job of it.
00,10then brotherhodd goes above and beyond
Lol!
Ed was friend-zone'd due to height....sad. :(
Dat Dupstep /)oO(\ Keeps me awake, dat and Too much Coffee
She did a poor job with the automail IIRC.

It's because he HATES milk
I can clarify it.
I hate milk
Morty: I certainly wouldn't call it terrible. It's a lot more out there, but it can stand on its own.

Chck Norris doesn't have fights
He doesn't need to
in that case mustang is best horse
He loojks at people.
Armstrong definitely wins.

It's like middle chield syndrome
00,10g2 is kinda odd cause it's more like anthro ponies
They care about the youngest because cutest, and care for oldest because biggest
*brodyquest starts playing*
Leaving the middle child ignored
rainowdash always dresses in style!
Since G4 has been the best, G1 and G3 were kinda bad, which leaves G2 out to be ignored
anthroponymorphic ponies?
Suddenly, Nina
But there is
hi All!
00,10the realy odd thing about g2 was how they lived in houses and went to school and had parties.......wait.
;_;
Nina. :(

G2 wasn't bad like I said
lol
05they were only out to get the laid in g2
The voce acting was bad and the styles were wierd
....oh no.
guys, G3>G4
dat walk
kill him and make some KFC
the voice acting is also of a much higher quality than G4.
And if I wanna know something and people try to change the subject as fast as RD can fly it only makes me want to know MORE
If you put Nyan Cat in a toaster, does it come out as rainbow dash?
