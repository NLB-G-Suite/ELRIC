0,5How do I make mIRC stop asking me to register? Its been over 30 days...
helooooo ponies!
0,5And its annoying t oclick every time...
Solution:
Don't use mIRC
Or just don't be lazy and keep telling it no. Have used it for years and never paid. :p
ummm .... regeister ?
ohai LordCelestia
0,5No, registering costs money
ok then keep telling it no :P
20$ to be exact
hey did i miss much
0,5But
ohai alexxm
10,02Ummm...register it?
0,5But that costs money!
0,5Money that I dont need tos pend on it!
hey Tarku have i missed much
not really, how long were you away
There are plenty of free irc clients out there..
I'm sure you could find a file that would take away the register screen for it, as well.
0,5And I am using mIRC
0,5hm.
Othen than that, probably just have to deal with it.
since i went to sleep at around 2:00 ish
0,5Nah, I know theres a way to get ri of it
Or just don't be lazy and keep telling it no. Have used it for years and never paid. :p <-----

Wb Fazana

I was eating breakkie
What did you see?
and I caught my neice being changed while walking into the room

Almost put me off my sammich D:
So I need to vapourise the cells that carry that information inside my brai
*Shaking*
'daww
I want it >:c
wantwantwantwantwant... sorry my mind skipped
I will force my mother to buy me it!
I don't even know if they are sold
=D
They arn't atm apparently
It's probably fanmade
But the person who made it will be putting some for sale
It is fanmade
they sell them on commision
make them on commision sorry
"Facebook? You mean it hasn't been renamed to Farmville yet?" lol
They're quite expensive, but SO AWESOME
Okay, that';s expensive
65 bucks O_e
it's for two though
about 40 quid O_O
Ahh
oh no wait
I misread
It's 65 if the pony has two colours
75 if 3
Holy mother of god
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/OCR-A_char_o_with_Dieresis.svg
That's nothing compared to what those plushies on ebay sells for though
So easy to spend £x00's on the amazing stuffs
Money = not exactly what I have atm
same for me Faz
I'm waiting for my mothers bloody house to sell D:<
Ohh, im just a student :p
Sell house, acquire ponies
I'm still at school.
Yes
I shall get them all "for my niece"
Then keep them for myself
they will be worn out by the time she gets them :p
I wish I had ink in my a3 printer D:
I wanna print off a buncha posters and wallpapers and such.
haha
isnt that A2?
ohh
sorry my bad
getting zisez mixed up
Yeah, all I have in my room to do with fan of anything is piccies of Mclarens from through the years
1977, 1988, 1991, 1996, 1999, 2006, 2009, 2012.
http://www.grandprixlegends.com/Images/Products/XLarge_Images/AS189_1.jpg <3
I got bob marley, pink floyd, system of a down, cycling, alan turing and nightshade posters... want colourful though
You've got that model?
I have a poster of the 1988 Mclaren (the piccy I just showd)
The model is 39.99 pounds at my local model shop
But it's the Mp4-9
Which is 1994
3*
Faz is it you who races cars?
Yes.
Ahh i couldnt remember the conversation last night so well
I wanna get into racing bikes soon, i already race bicycles
I'm kinda into bikes, but bloody Monster energy corrupts all the sponsers.
Then again, in F1, fags corrupted the sponsers
how so?
2/3 bikes I see have Monster on it D;
ahh
It's like the company are made of cash
/me is bored now.

Hmm that he did, also curious
/me tries to avoid explosion
Jim you heartattacked too heard over the Flutter cousion?
Simon2: sorry, it seems that chrome simply doesnt suport what i need to make the addon work :(
I was looking at ponies, had a moment of too much hnnng
Ahh, okay
Spinning ponies are so cute that you just want to explode
Twice

The CMC on a turntable is so awesome
Simon: Simon2: you online?
I don't think so, havent heard from him in quite a bit
Oh.
I know what I need to do.
Pony slipmats.
Anything streaming or do I need to f5?
:D
There's nothing streaming at the moment
PinkiePie101: nothing streaming
Slipmat?
oh.
Is it equal to a welcome mat?
Fazana: Slipmat, felt mat put on turntables to increase slipping, so that you can slip-cue a track when DJ-ing.
Ahh, okay *Knows nothing about Disc Jockies D:
>Jockies
L4D anyone?
Not 2, doesn't run on my PC
But 1 is fie
L4D :D
Fazana: No matter. It's superfluous information at best anyway. =)
Ookay
We should go L4D later

Pootis penser here
PinkiePie101: You rang?

I agree with Kammerjunk
I like trains.

Danish keyboard here.
rainbow dash
alexxm: Twilight, obviously.
English Keyboard
Celestia is best pony.
Right next to Trixie
Fazana pony is best pony
Poor Lyra
loganlogan360: Not much, but I understand it
And thus, Twixie is best ship.
:3
Twixie is best choccy bar
Now I feel like going to danish equivalent of a convenience store and get some Twix.
going to the Danish*
The sweet and carbsome twixie.
Imma gonna getta Danish now
So good and delicious
I want to go to the English equivilent of a convienience store (Corner shop in our country) and get some Red Bull
Fazana or off-license
Problem is that I have no dosh in cash.
I'd go to the Swedish equivalent, but I'm broke, tired from shoveling snow, and wya too lazy.
Depends, off licencies tend to be newsagents nowadays
Or village shop
they arent always on corners
Mine is :)
It's on the corner before a snicket
Admittedly mine is, but the gap between the corner and the adjacent buiting is about 10 cm wide
the village shop is a local shop for local people there's nothing for you here
My shop is about 3 roads away
I live where Leuge of gentlemen is set
well film
Go halfway down the road I live and go into a shot roa
filmed
Then go to the end of the 100 meter road into the snikcet
damn my typing has gone out the window
mines preaty much just round the corner but it's got a lidl's just a few doors down
Same
Correct typing is for silly fillies.
No it isn't
Correct typing is for non derpy people
6_9
But Derpy is awesome D:
I never said otherwise
;)
Derpy will be removed because 'ableism'.
nope.avi
i live 2 miles from 2 3 tesco's (all full size) a lidl and an asda otherwise its all small shops
Derpy will stay
Hasbro confirmed that they have no plans to remove Derpy.
It was on EQD.

Feels bad learning otherwise.
But have fun anyway.
Thanks Kammerjunk

Imma go lie down for a short while folks
good rest to you KwakLad
See you later, then.
sleep tight KwakLad
and I still own not one mlp merchandise
Ponymon, gotta catch 'em all.
ekips: likewise
ekips: what is wrong with you....
the better question is, what is wrong with the stores in my radius, emangamer?
Neither do I. But that's because the nearest toy store selling ponies is a few miles away.
ekips: good point. I apologise
And with a few, I mean 7.
And my bike is broken.
Kammerjunk: thats why god invented cars
Oh hi, DCD.
09,01mornin'
09,01no stream eh?
it's okay eman :>
emangamer: I'm 15.
09,01let's fix that
ohai dcd
Let me guess, it's time for "Oh, japan~"
Kammerjunk 7 mile walk? That's nothing.
Kammerjunk: thats why god invented hotwiring
No, but it's BORING.
Get an MP3
DWR_Drawing: you mean 14 mile walk...
Of course^
forgot the trip back.
09,01naw
If I was able to read while doing so, I would.
But having a book in the wind we get here is a bad idea.
09,01time for something I haven't streamed in a while
Get a kindle
Fourze?
i dont even know the next store that sells mlp stuff
NewDCD: Danny phantom?
I don't know ANY store that sells MLP stuff
Kammerjunk: is there a mcdonalds near you? they have started to resell MLP stuff
Argos MIGHT. but I dunno
Fazana: McD's in a little while
do you have ergo proxy?
They have? Or is that just in the US?
emangamer They have? I need to check UK ones then.
O_e, WHAT
Because the UK sucks when it comes to buying pony.
*Wants neice to go to maccies and get a kidsmeal
Kammerjunk and DWR_Drawing IDK about elsewhere but they have in the US
UK sucks for fandom. Full stop.
^
Dat full stop.
Imagine living in northern Norway
Except shows that orignate in the UK.
Like Doctor Who
There's basicly nothing here
MOTHER OF GOD: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ825nDKTDs/Tzy-lcB813I/AAAAAAAAfOY/Pi0Efohsw6E/s1600/1.jpg
Doctor who is probably the only decent UK show
Nice.
that I can think of right now
Monty python was brill
emangamer: See, you would NEVER see that over here.
no fucking way: http://www.etsy.com/listing/92894838/made-to-order-gummy-plushie-pattern?ref=af_shop_favitem
emangamer: That's awesome
The guys at the pizza store would be like "What?"
but gummy doesn't give enough fucks to be a plushie
Or they would not bother drawing anything Kammerjunk.
That too.
Gummy gives NO fucks.
But if I was to work at a pizza store...Then that would be entirely different.
I think Gummy needs to seriously calm down.
GUYS: Bronies react to Teens react to MLP
Btw, what is DCD gonna stream?
this should be promising
09,01it's a sur-priiiise
ekips: You don't need drawing capabilities for that.
emangamer: Some of those teens are REALLY stupid
09,01also Fazana: Sherlock
AGH, you startled me :(
Jim: but the BRONIES are reacting to the video
emangamer The only good thing about that teens react vid was the one guy who said he was going to check out the show.
I hang up posters of Dashie saluting in front of the Danish flag on a regular basis.
emangamer: Wait, what
Oh my
DWR_Drawing: its BRONIES REACT to teens react
Other than that, I lost all humanity in teens even though I am one.
/me needs to watch that
Kammerjunk but it becomes easier
Same

They have no respect for anything decent
and this "Modern music" crap

emangamer: as a bisexual, I find that remark highly offensive
Oh shaddap
ScootaChicken: you know I wub woo

stalking on facebook?

/me hugs #bronystate
/me pats emangamer on the forehead
/me hugs emangamer
Oh dear
I've found it
I had such a hard time watching the Teens React to My Little Pony video.
I wasn't sure whether to laugh at their obliviousness, rage at their shallowness or be ashamed of being in that age group.
not trying to defend them but they were only shown the intro
Morning everypony
That's true.
I'm completely oblivious! "I'm well aware!"
heya LunaTheBeloved
hey Luna
But I doubt it'd matter.
Hi
If you watch something with a set opinion, it's irrelevant how good it is.
i mean i'm sure i'm not the only one who skips the intro
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved
Also, I just saw a Dark Side of the Rainboom T-shirt.
Do want.
Kammerjunk I had a set opinion of mlp before watching fim
/me hugs Yellowquiet1
and now I am here
But you can't have been that closeminded, then, since you realised that oh dear, this show is absolutely amazing.
Before I watched MLPFIM, I used to hate it.
I didn't.
I just scrolled past the threads on /b/.
Hating something is so much work than not hating something, anyway.
Oh my god.
http://www.redbubble.com/people/stinkehund/works/7872487-hang-in-there-pony i want that ^^
That is awesome
It is.
do they send into luxemburg ?

i can't believe it is almost a year since i joined the fandom ~.~
brb
Almost half a year for me
I've been watching it since September
I just remembered, what happened in September...
i see what you did there
Oh wait, I just realised something
Wrek isn't here.

I DO NOT DISAGREE
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
But I don't agree either.

you're welcome xcanox :>
Try saying "Captian Capslock and his Capital Letter Crew" five times fast.
what game is this
09,01SRW Z2 - World Destruction Chapter
sound is a little bit rough
09,01yeah that's due to it coming from a PSP
xcanox: Having a habit of pronouncing "captain" as "cap'n" makes it a little easier.
09,01nothing can be done about that (but during gameplay, the music masks the static, anyways)
Oh hi, Wrek.

Trixie shirts! YAY
09,01not in this SRW, but GaoGaiGar was in SRW Alpha 2, 3 and W
Oh I know this game

I forget the ENGLISH name.
So I heard Derpy's voice.
Is code geass in here?
"A Mishap with the Elements of Harmony leave Twilight and Discord with each others powers." I am so reading that.
She sounds derpy. B|
She sounds like a derp.

ScootaChicken is just a soul who's intentions are good. Oh Lord, please don't let him be misunderstood.
The Bronies will flood the world with Pixel Art!

Randomnerd: Our pixel art will block out the Sun!
ScootaChicken fought the law and the law won.
xcanox's mother was a tailor, she sewed his new blue jeans

Kammerjunk: Then we shall derp in the shade.

Alright guys, I gotta go get ready for work

wb jim
Welcome back Yellowquiet1
Resaluta, Jim et Yellowquiet1.
^^
Kammerjunk: judging by Luna's facebook, she's doing a lot of ACTAvism.
That's nice.
09,01Yeah she is
I'm hopefully going to a protest in Copenhagen on the 25th.
09,01Big Sister is the best <3
I did some IRL ACTAvism
enemy phase..dun dun DUNN
whats up? Hows everypony today?
that was fun
i'm good
The cieling is iup and I'm fine
wha?
Never mind.
Fazana: The earth is round, there is no up or down
Fine thanks, you too?
I'm good. What about you?
That's what Kammer said
Jim blasphemy!
Literally, yes.
It's spanish
It's Latin.
just trying to figure out something to do
gundams in this game odd i thought it was one of the more realstic series
Really?
Eeyup.
and what is on stream?
Looks loads like Spanish
09,01Gundams are the classic representatives of "Real Robot" types in SRW
dat rider kick
ok thanks
09,01that is, Low Defense, "realistic weapons", high evasion
09,01"Super Robots" are high defense, flashy moves, low evasion...basically tankier
inb4 crit
Fazana: Spanish is, as well as French and Italian, romantic languages.
09,01Crowe is so boss <3
so where would an eva fall under then
09,01EVAs are considered Hybrids, it's a huge debate
is this a game or like a vid we are watching...
I don't even know what's going on anymore.
09,01but in the game they play kind of like Supers with high evasion
ok
09,01and Proto: I'm playing
oh ok
heyo
i don't japanese i just enjoy watching the fights in this game
09,01same.
the fights are kinda cool
the battle scenes are so long
What the hell
09,01you can turn them off but what's the fun in that
He got ripped apart, and survives it
then comes together again
that's what i meant i enjoy watching
09,01SRW LOGIC.
Fazana: oh, japan~
O_e
*Mind....blown*
oh I forgot that it's Oh, Japan~ time
Hello everypony, back from work, so whats on ?
so where would something like a super sentais mech fall under
hi Scavender
Welcome back Scavender
WHat up Scavender
are there medabots in this :3
hey Scavender
09,01>Medabots
09,01that'd be HILAROUS
09,01ohai Big Macintosh Cuvie
Hm... Hey Ocean! is nice :)
Seems legit
NewDCD would a super sentais mech be conserded a super robot then
Airplane got blasted
nope
09,01DEFINITELY.
what s the point in this game
09,01hot blood.
09,01that's the point.
The point is cool fight scenes it seems
ok still new to mech series
09,01I really gotta stream Getter
only seen gurren lagann and gaogargai
Oh Japan~
is wrek streamin?
No.
DCD is
oh
Suddenly, face
oh so this fight is after kamina died then
y no one die yet?
Rapeface
09,01this is the fight against the four generals (as in the movie)
ok
What movie?
09,01after this comes Teppelin
09,01Gurren-Hen
if this is in the gurrenn universe, how did the other mechs get there?
inb4rapeface
09,01nah this is the SRW Z Universe....Orguss' dimension bomb went off, and then, Shenanigans
Does that thing refill its life all the time?
do u chosse what move the mechs do or do u only move them
09,01the stories are all interconnected
09,01yeah I choose the attacks
There's 4 options
good after-morning people
thanks for telling
09,01more, it all depends on the mech
ohai Dken2021
execute, battle scene toggle, what moves to use, and summat else
Hi
Might be items or summat
would this be live or DCD's auto playlist thingie?
09,01live
Hey Dken2021
hey Dken2021
7 hours until 24 hours remaining
05untill my math final
Yeah
05yey
good luck Wrek
good luck
What's ep 18 gonna be?
/)
10 hours later->player phase :>
Jim: (\
00,10I see gunmen this must be srwx2
/me /) (\ Jim
It most certainatly is.
00,10Morning all
morning Sumica
Morning
heya Sumica
Afternoon Sumica
Mornin Sumica
do u need to know much about the other series to know whats going on
sup Sumica
No, just Japanese
*crash* BOOM
00,10bleh I slpet in. too much dickingaround with trying to mod minecraft.
so just wondering...you understand this or u just guessing
lemme guess, mine little pony?
Sumica: What are you doing?
Jiggle....-_- Oh japan/
00,10was trying to get build craft to work.
ohai
am i the only one who thought this game would have been something like dynasty warriors instead of a stragry game no offense NewDCD
I want a Techniks server
oh boy, buildcraft....
09,01BIG O
ok...whats Buildcraft?
09,01SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTAIMU
00,10Dynasty warriors + Ponies.
= Dynasty Ponies
sounds interesting
wait, what's japanese batman doing here?
Haha
09,01being awesome
09,01that's what
:)
how is this guy japanese batman
big o game...?
00,10I am saddend by the lack of gekostate here
and yes, I know the anime's has nothing to do with batman, but he's just reminds me so much of it
09,01there's Nirvash Spec V
09,01but that's just fabulous and not awesome
00,10Getter crotch lazor
advance wars is best handheld strategy
as anyone ever heard of a game for gamecube i assume, called Custom Robo
09,01yeah I have
Yay purple ray of death ...
how come this game hasan't been bought over here yet
wait what the heck is this?
i see gundams and big O
09,01alexxm: because COPYRIGHT NIGHTMARE
gurren laggan is also involved
09,01and Morty: Super Robot Wars Z2 - The World Destruction Chapter
ok
00,10oh movie nervash
is it just like every mecha ever crammed in one?
00,10more or less
i think so
09,01yeah but with a coherent and incredibly enjoyable plot (we can't understand boo hoo)
00,10spinny death
He better be dead now
Because that's kind of overkill
has this series had EVA's in it
inb4 crit
i dont understand the combat...
:D
09,01F/F Final, Alpha 1 and 3, MX, Rebuild in one of the DS games
Me neither, but its okay
ok thanks
09,01and the worst part is SRW is semi-canon to the EVA canon
how is it semi canon
Again pinged by the Canon Monster.
09,01(Kaworu hints in Rebuild he's the same Kaworu as all those games, because in those games, Kaworu is an "arbitrator"/implied to be one of the series' Time Divers)
Client: Y U PING ME WHEN "CANON" IS SED?
Man i really need something to do
09,01and Anno wrote several of the SRW scenarios involving EVA
wth?
guy got a walking battleship
ok anyone else who wrote the orignal series write anything for the games
so u drag a mech on a bad robot, then tons of cutscene and victory?
whats the name of that walking battleship again?
dai gurren
09,01not that I know of, EVA is an interesting case because SRW might be canon to it
09,01and Morty: Think Fire Emblem with more eye candy
ok
yeah thats what i was thinking
oh i actually know this one
its uh
was that guy japanese V
shit
more or less alexxm
ok thanks ekips
09,01KYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODAIIIIIIIII GATTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAI
09,01or "Sibling Combination"
Oo
10? really?
i never got that comboantion i mean yay "yay i get to sit around and be used as a weapon"
Why does that thing remind me of a banana?
dat measly 10 hp
TTGL?
or some graphic novel variation?
here the overkill again
jim something must be wrong with your mind sorry
oh game equivalent?
oh
btw hi again
09,01yeah least damage you can take is 10
hi KwakLad
ok
hi KwakLad
code geass?
is that it?
Kaboom
09,01there are other commands that increase damage, make the next attack have a 100% hit chance, make the next attack by the enemy miss obligatorily, increase your hit chance and decrease their hit chance...and they consume SP
purple eyes guy?
the animations sure are stunning
hello everypony
hey dashiee
Sup Dashiee
Ohai dashiee
ohai dashiee
hello dashiee
heya dashiee
Hello
use teh burning gundam!
Drive me closer, I want to hit them with my sword.
so what are we watchin?
I can imagine this game can become boring over time...
09,01I would, I use it all the time in A Portable
09,01nah, you got TOO MANY ROBOTS to get bored
You won't feel alone when you have SO MANY ROBOTS!
Well maybe its because I dont play, and dont uderstand what is going on very well.
of course this has my attention cuz i kinda like strtegy fames
games*
So many robots for luna on the moon
my god this game looks epic
09,01it's funny, a robot in this game has a BANISHED TO THE MOON PUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNCH
inb4 20 damange
this has got my attention because of the cut scnes
09,01but we had a route split
09,01so it's not available atm
burning!
y u no use burning?
don't forget if this game does follow gurren laganns story the moon is a robot
09,01Burning isn't in this SRW. I use it in the games that has it
09,01you should try SRW J, it got translated
epic sprites
09,01for GBA
i thought i saw it o.O
09,01it has G Gundam units
He shot two freezing missiles with his sword :D
Nice, got my attention
who is up and to the left of big O NewDCD
gundam <3
is this for someone like on an emulator or console...or is it on the PC?
official translation or fan translation?
09,01fan
something*
ah
09,01no main series SRW has gotten translated due to COPYRIGHT NIGHTMARE
09,01this one's on PSP
oh ok
who's missle launcher shoulder guy
09,01Chirico Cuvie from VOTOMs...which I plan to stream soon
is that hero?
ima just look it up
and i assume there isnt an english version?
09,01yeah
ok i thought so
http://scottthong.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/twisparhammer40k.jpg
Jim: Lol
Heh
ok whos overkill guy
This game's got amazing fight scenes
lmao
09,01Crowe Broust, Banpresto Original Character for this game
that just took someone on
ok
and he's ok!
wing gundam looks alot like burning
29500 hp, seems legit
oh noes big O!
09,01pretty much all main Gundams look like the RX-78
big o likes to pawnch
it attacks! You win!
lol
NewDCD how is big o like batman i've never seen it
it's not
ok
09,01the art style and mood is a lot like Batman The Animated Series
i think he is like batman
oh ok
09,01and the main character is a dude that lives in a mansion, has a badass butler, and has awesome gadgets
09,01otherwise he's not that much like Bats
ok
09,01he's more like Bruce Wayne if he fought crime without a secret identity
i think roger and bruce wayne are similar
09,01yeah they are
stoic serious types
Holy shit, this credit card bill.
and they both have awkward friendships with th epolice chiefs
Fuck fuck fuck...
o.O
whats up Randomnerd?
There is not much enemies left, is it ?
Bought too many ponies?
It's just really steep. I'm the most self-destructive idiot I know.
09,01I think not, but chances are enemy reinforcements will arrive
dat buster canon
since when were gundams transformers
09,01since Zeta's WaveRider mode
must eat food...ill brb
ok as i said only seen part of gaogaigar and gurren lagann and thats the extent of my mech knowledge
use mic sounders!
09,01...if only he was in Z2 ;____;
09,01he's in the Alpha Games though
would the denliner be conserded a mech
09,01I don't think so. And quite frankly Den-O sucks.
definately not a crit
ok just wondering
lol y do those missles never do shit?
09,01because I'm the best at what I do
stream things from japan to bronies?
GIGADRILL
Taste my drillbit sucker
giga drill breaker is best finisher
Still looking for a real god damn job.
Spiky guy
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
the fuck is this?
THIS IS SUPER ROBOT WARS!
Robots and stuff
Z IIRC
i thought power rangers
how come it has 3 pilots
no
bc it does
ok
One pilots, the other two use suppor skills
it's probably a combiner
ok thanks
09,01One watches the energy systems, another is the engineer, and the guy that looks like Apollo Justice is the main pilot
...
thanks
NewDCD: YES YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD!!!!
has there been a PS1 emulator been made yet?
NewDCD: also, where's your nick at?

it isn't
are these games only on handhelds
well for me it is

alexxm: They came out only in Japan really
i know a site where you can get nearly every rom/iso

They are mostly Japan only mostly due to licenencing
yes nido :>
09,01yes, Chirico Cuvie is THAT boss
Spiky guy is spiky...
paradise92: I hae a site for roms, I need .iso files
well that
dude
NewDCD: did he just basically say "Fuck You?"
iso,roms
it contains everything
09,01eeyup
IN A VOTOM!
it would be insanely wanglely and expencive to get the rites to do a NA and EU port
damn
thus patches are all you can hope for
Dumori: it would and it SUCKSSSSS!!! We only got TWO real SRT games here
otakon http://www.rom-freaks.net/psx-isos-0-asc-name-.html here ya go

Dic......sword
NewDCD: me too
that is the most phallic robot ive ever seen
is it from a hentai lol

emu paradise is also a good source imo

NewDCD: you have a LOT of dodger types don't you? WHERE ARE THE SUPER ROBOT TANKS?
09,01otakon: another route

alexxm: I'm not sure

can somepony explain to me what is the plot here?
robotd
NewDCD: ARGH!!!! But they're so much fun!!!
09,01paradise: itscomplicated.jpg
...
09,01the plot FAQs in GameFAQs are your best bet
paradise92: Robot pilots from across multiple universe's team up to save existence basically from some ridiculously overpowered threat.
basically
everytime
damn
ohh its multiple universes
Mazinger can NOT take a hit
otakon sooo basically like every other fighting anime/hentai/japanese game?
lol
09,01they do awesome shit like say FUCK YOU to Instrumentality, Fight Alien Empires, travel to the end of the Galaxy, and say FUCK YOU to preordained destiny
EAT MY FLAME!
paradise92: STOP.COMPARING.THIS.TO.HENTAI.OR.I.WILL.END.YOU!!!!!
09,01technically otakon
09,01Demonbane was a Hentai/Mecha VN
otakon but come on...this is pure yaoi mech :D
09,01and it was crazy awesome and got a clean anime adaptation
paradise92: fuck no
does this scenrio inculde the second bit of gurren lagann
otakon do you know what is a yaoi?
NewDCD in the anime dont they say 'FUCK YOU' litterally and metaphorically?
09,01nah that's in Z2.2 which comes out in april
NewDCD: is said Demonban in this or any other?
IM FIRING MAH LAZEEEH!
09,01this game is so big, IT'S SPLIT INTO TWO GAMES
paradise92: yes I know what it is
09,01otakon: not yet
otakon sexy :D
paradise92: no not sexy
Hentia has grades of hardcoreness and /D/ belonging
09,01it's almost as overpowered as the Zearth
IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE!
skyrim is so big it ripped my ps3
NewDCD: your near the end of the game aren't you judging from the levels I see you at
09,01You used to be a gamer just like me
so we have to wait a couple of months to have the moon robot then
Morty: that's just wrong man, so wrong
09,01then you took a Skyrim to the Blu-Ray Drive
alexxm: stop that!
indeed xD
sorry

Morty: it's a beast man
chibi robot?
BIG O!!! LETS GO!

So close to 10000
KSO means shit ;D

paradise92: ALL the sprites are done in the SD style of art
and then Wing Gundam
otakon i got that already just by looking at the game :S
paradise92: there, your faux yaoi right there, enjoy
xDDD
hahahaha
:D
this game...seems so easy
smexy :)
horse face?
MISS!
Morty: it is when you know what your doing
SUPAAA SPEEEDOO!
Hey he has horse tail...
Morty: otherwise, well expect to be curbstomped
09,01it's an sRPG. Make the right choices, and it becomes easy
^^
i like it when games are hard when you kno what you're doing
09,01fuck up, it becomes hard
I take it this dude's the silent type

Dken2021: MORPHEUS! how are you friend?
LEVEL UPU!!

09,01Alpha Gaiden kicked my ass several times
NewDCD: I've only managed to beat OG1 myself on all modes
09,01that's also a good choice
Can't wait for Diablo 3 to kick my ass :S
NewDCD: OG2, final true boss with the 7 turn limit......

NewDCD: ever see it? Looks interesting

otakon dude...mw3 is hacked in 2 days :D :D well that is because it uses the same files as mw2 :/

GUys
Do you have Tunngle?
If you do lets play
amazing!
Titan Quest :D :D
NewDCD: Happy Tomino? oh god, he's the one that usually kills off his characters isn't he?
09,01yeah
??
00,10......this mod is making me want to punch walls.
09,01but he did that when struggling with depression
that inner robot is so kawaii :'D
09,01by Gainer, he wasn't depressed
How so ?
KAWAAAIIII
jk jk
hiya Sumica
00,10hi otakon
09,01wouldn't be surprised, sounds like Tomino
damn
Renton cannot take a hit worth a damn
kawaii!
whats the robot with the staff
NewDCD: you might want to dodge next time
09,01I'll defend instead
alexxm: no idea, but it's from Eureka 7
ok thanks
09,01I think Renton has prevailed
popo poses no real threat guys
09,01as he gets damaged, his stats get buffed as well
he just looks scary
NewDCD: but it's a dodge type! it doesn't have the defense for that!
09,01so once he's in low health, enemies hit chance become zero
okay
...
sooo
mfw hes 1 shot KO'd
not cool
yo
/me looks for a never never never loop
hiya gary
otakon: on the plus side, if he gets hit it might hurt that annoying inner voice that mech has
09,01Defend an approximately 4000 attack = about 2100 damage......still in a good position
Morty: but I like it
it's less annoying than Navi that's for sure
have you seen friendship is witchcraft?
crap
CRAP
wtf?
Battlship
this is gonna hurt
anythings less anoyning than navi otakon
wtf did i just see an evil dolphin!?
NewDCD is the landscape like river,mountains give some advantage?
Morty: yes you did
paradise92: they do
O______O
CAN WE TURN OFF DARI?
argh!
...
what is this I don't even...evil dolphins
ummm
lol its true japan really does hate dolphins
i just realized i screw'd over my writing...
haven't you ever watched Futurama?
Dolphins are EVIL
Guarme!
oh, japan~
should put Do the and not Is the
....
damn
WOW
good he dodged
!!!!!
Watch out, sand....
AAAA!
yeah, just a dent
Wait
34500 hp, wow
damn that thing
is that robot the Shreder Mobile?
Jim: that's NOTHING!!! There are bosses with HP counts into the MILLIONS
Dolphins are from outer space...
can every robot heal itself?
Morty: no sadly
It's the most I've seen here (I've never played the game mind you)
gurren lagaan
Morty: though there are pilots that can heal other bots and some have auto repair and there are accessories that allow you to heal other bots
was wondering where she was
i'm off to play tribes: ascend, cee ya all
YAY
09,01and some have Spirit Commands that heal you
oh, oppai shot how I've missed you
bye ekips
bye ekips have fun
bye ekips
wait since when did yoko have dayakas gunman
cya ekips
09,01since the Gurren-hen movie
alexxm: in the movie IIRC
ekips and don't break a pinkie promise
that robot that is half a sphere is dumb. it gets least cool robot award
ok
Morty: it's a tankbot
its Tom as a robot
YES!
Tom would be a super for sure in this
sooo um
i heard Tom was going to wrestle cena this year
urooko outo helre comues Tomu!
Do any of you ever have that feel when you just have no idea what the hay to play?
(look out here comes Tom)
Kammerjunk: Yeah
Morty: a basic classification of the types of robots used in this is Real Type or Super Type. Super's are all flashy OP attacks and usually are tanks and Real Types use guns/lasers and are usually good dodgers.
NewDCD are you japanese or do you have some sorth of super natural power to read japanese?
09,01nah SRW is easy to learn to play
09,01just play the translated games
NewDCD just like batman...
Oh good, so it's not just me.
yes
09,01and understanding the menus become second nature
god I wish I had this
and could read japanese
09,01me too
i currently have that feel
/me is thinking on learning Japanese
BIG O!!!! SHOW TIME!!!!!!
Hanna means Flower in Jap.
I'd play some Amnesia, since I'm alone in the house, but Amnesia is best played at midnight.
Tons Of Machines (T.O.M)
NOW that is a Giant Robot!
Amnesia isn't scary
goddamnit I love this music
09,01otakon: SURE PROMISE.mp3
NewDCD: IKR!!!!
Paranormal Activity is scary (only the first part)
09,01I also recommend Apologine - Bleecker Street from the Big O OST
did BIG O DODGE?!?!?!?
holy SHIT!!!
i laughed through all of them paradise92
I didn't even KNOW BIG O could DODGE!!!
you laughed...i cried in the corner
lmao
You find X scary, I find Y scary.
i saw the first one sort of reminded me of a slenderman series
hiya Kammerjunk
Hi, otakon.
09,01otakon: Strike + Alert in one Spirit Command : 3
FLYING DISCOO OF DOOOM!!!
NewDCD: nice man, but it must be expensive. did you pick up SP regen for any of your pilots yet?
Oh god please dont tell me you guys are watching big o
09,01don't think so, and it isn't
09,01Alert costs 10, Strike costs 15, the co-ed command is 20
09,01also DAT BOSS LOOKING AT THE EXPLOSION
paradise92: you should see Boss Borot, he has an attack that literally throws EVERYTHING at an enemy.
GUYS MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!!!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4lJ7f7ucxw&feature=g-all-u&context=G25ae3c0FAAAAAAAAAAA
NewDCD: is Boss Borot in this one?
PLEASE GO SING THE PETITION!!!
09,01I think not
09,01maybe in the next game
I WANT FOR OFFICIALRAINBOWDASH2 TO CONTINUE PUTTING MLP VIDEOS
paradise92 what's it for?
well hasbro stopped him from putting episodes of MLP
on youtube
they wont allow it for 500 signatures
09,01time for NIA WRIGHT
well paradise92 that's there right as the copyright holders if he was putting up eps of MLP
Super Battleship DudE!
paradise92: if it was fanwork however, then I shall
09,01>implying Hasbro will allow you to re-upload their copyrighted content with 500 signatures
oh he is SO BONED
09,01uhh, better open a new account man.
otakon but i don't have anywhere else to watch...sooo...
if i can find 500 thugs who think armed robbery is ok I cant just go have them send a letter to congress
paradise92: search
paradise92: but no, if it was for uploading MLP eps Hasbro is in the right I'm afraid
actually, this is more like 500 people asking apple for free i phones
otakon and even if my tv channels would get it it would be horribly sinchronized...
just like dbz...
paradise92: SEARCH.BUCKING.YOUTUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!
it sounds like porn when you close your eyes
NO
paradise92: it's easy
otakon too.lazy.to.do.THAAAAT.
paradise92: god
ok can we end this now? obviously no one is signing
indeed, I'm sorry but it's not going to make a difference either I'm afraid
...
i just wanted to help out
AAAAAArrrrrrrgh !
sorry paradise92 it just seems way too pointless
hiya TrixieMuffin
hiya otakon
bastards...i hate you all
09,01paradise: you gotta understand copyright law a bit when you're an owner of a site like this. And I can safely tell you: that person is boned.
/me cries in the corner
NewDCD: this guy was the inspiration for Rai wasn't he?
09,01nahhhh, Rai¿s...different
Dan Hibiki different?
im playing "I wanna be the boshy" 50 deaths so far on the first spiky thing
09,01but in all serious paradise, I wouldn't sign that petition if I were you.
paradise92: im sowie...you cant just petition to break the law after youve been asked to stop
NewDCD: really? your telling me he(who is a Ranged Real Dodge Type) and him aren't even a bit similar?
yeah
o.o is this one of the super robot wars games?
09,01Hasbro has the information of 500 potential copyright violators
the SIGNERS will get blacklisted
09,01and you could get your ass prosecuted.
Boom baby
Midnight_Tempest: eeyup, enjoy the fireworks
/me lights Midnight_Tempest on fire
*gasp* it might be a Hasbro conspiracy!
take that...
/me puts out Midnight_Tempest immediately
hiya CountDoofus
damn...
NewDCD FBI will be at my door for watching My Little Pony -_-
hi
/me steals Midnight_tempest's lunchmoney in all the commotion
NewDCD it would be "Equilibrium" all over the place
lmao
how long has this one fight been going on?
09,01paradise: hey, they fined a woman with a 1.5 million suit for downloading 24 songs off the internet.
CountDoofus: a couple of turns
GOD THAT pokuuuuuuuuuuuu!
NewDCD i knw that...
Morty: it's so CUTE!!!
ok im switching to easy mode
no its death
I wonder if I can hug a energy core?
i want to hug it with insulators
otakon you can "hug" my "energy core" :3
NewDCD: WHY YOU NO USE KING KITTAN!!!!
um
paradise92: um indeed
Ooh My
-_-
09,01bottom line is, you gotta be REALLY careful with what you do
eeyup
with a sign list that small
09,01if you can unsign the petition, I'd recommend it
NewDCD true...
POPO NOOOOO
they probably could potentially track all involved
on suspicion of copyright infringement or involvement with it
ohgod
I wouldn't have to resort to YT if Apple could be arsed to put MLP episodes on European iTunes...
NewDCD: a 500 person list petitiong the right to break copyright law? Hasbro won't even look at it
CountDoofus: true, but thats a license issue I'm afraid
lol Orguss
here comes dodgy!
Midnight_Tempest: is THAT what they're saying?
yup
it's a Super Fortress Macross bot isn't it?
no
omg a talking tapir!
dodgy dodgerson
its from the same people that made Macross though otakon
Midnight_Tempest: um, but the bot design and the music!
09,01Tempest, you were the guy that liked Orguss?
^_^
NewDCD: what is Orguss from?
Orgieus?
09,01from....Super Dimension Century Orguss
^
Damn artillery types, SO ANNOYING!!!!
SO, Macross under aother name right?
09,01nope, it's pretty different
09,01it deals with alternate universe shenanigans
despite having similar music
wouldnt it be awkward for the high quality animation characters to meet the goofy animation characters?
09,01and it's a VITAL part to the plot of Z2
similar mech designs and concepts
wouldnt it be like meeting a freak?
and similar character designs
yh, completely different
09,01it's surprisingly seamless
alternate universe shennigans are best shennigans
BIG O!!! SHOW TIME!!!!!!!!!
09,01otakon: Both had character designs by Haruhiko Mikimoto <3
lol flash step Big O
Laser!
otakon http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2905/

YES!
big o is awesome... needs moar Schwartzwald though
okay, THAT was funny
Midnight_Tempest: but he's a villain!
BEST VILLIAN EVER!
Midnight_Tempest: technically
ovaskillu
09,01Schwartzwald was in the first game
dat King Gainer, such an od Mech design
NewDCD: wasn'
09,01Z1 I mean
t he a boss though?
09,01yeah
yh though so
do we butcher japanese as much as they butcher engrish?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1293/ umm ponyception
Morty: yh
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1559/

09,01not all of them
well, in general
NewDCD: herdmind
Actual Japanese girls look nothing like these anime girls
/me is more of an ass man anyways
CountDoofus: i'd prefer a woman whos bust size is actually proportional to her body rather than a woman whos specifically had surgery to increase her bust size
not me
from what ive gathered, NewCDC has it set up so all enemy attacks miss or dont do very much
though I don't not appreciate a nice ass
09,01Morty: pretty much
lol otakon
@DCD http://www.retromodo.co.uk/img/p/15047-5921-large.jpg?
lol
Ingwaz: totally agree
:D
are they in defensive stances or something?
how does one lose this game?
Morty: no, just defensive skill
Fazana no but i have seen 3 japanese girls wearing sailor suit uniforms walking through my village which was odd considering its a northern back water village :p
Morty: it depends on the stage
i'm a fan of both ass and boobs
I was aimed at this "http://www.retromodo.co.uk/img/p/15047-5921-large.jpg"
Crap, mybad
Copy and paste = clunky >:c
miss
called it :p
Morty: sometimes it's a time limit, other times it's getting wiped out, other times it's one unit's loss or other stuff
i cant see a wipe out happening at this rate
09,01gotta take a phone call.
Morty: there are some where you have to get an enemy down to a certain percentage of their HP WITHOUT destroying them
NewDCD: save it at least!
how come
bc it's importante!
09,01nevermind
miss
09,01wrong number
lol
Trolol
called it again -_-
damn I wonder if my computer could support a PSP emulator
anypony play the new Warhammer game at all? If so, is it any good?
oh well. going to see the latest nostalgia critic video, then off to bed (at 8PM, bleh)
09,01PSP emulation is very wonky
@Otakon, what specs are your PC?
09,01this is an actual PSP hooked to my PC
NewDCD: NEAT!
Fazana: um not really sure how to post that
yeah the one on xbox just came out? or u think i mean the pc ones
and...
miss?
Right, press start, then right click "My computer"
Then press properties
do the first two shots always miss
what game are you playing NewDCD? i've seen it before, but cant remember what the series is called
yea ok
just wondering
i remember it looks awesome though
im trying demo now
okay then wat?
i have a feeling the enmy is saying something cocky
You should see your RAM, Storage, 32/64 bit blahdiblah
do you?
but its like, you have no chance bro
lrn 2 hit
mfw I'm using up 400GB of HD space....
HD isn't much of a problem
It's graphic acrd and RAM
otakon: 400GB for what?
pony pr0n
My 3GB RAM PC can't run a Gamecube emu at full
Ingwaz: I knew IT!
i wish i knew about computery things like that, then maybe i could play skyrim on pc
got to be careful and clean out your NSFW pony folder from time to time otakon
Jesus! this game is brutal!
Well what were you planning on playing skyrim on? Washing machine?
I don't have a NSFW pony folder
Fazana my 4 GB RAM PC runs Dragon Ball Z :Infinite World just fine :D
a dell?
of some sort
I keep ponies and that stuff FAR FAR FAR FAR away from each other
On GAMECUBE EMULATOR?
psxc2
PS2's fine
Gamecube isn't so fine
I'm running a HP 5GB Ram
dolphine?
is anyone else's stream stopped?
64 bit OS
Morty: Yea
k good
NewDCD: he's taking a call, give him a seconds
Otakon, it *MIGHT* work then
Fazana is it dolphine?
yeah Morty
Dolphin, yes
Fazana: it MIGHT? yesh, how powerful is a PSP?
ahh yeah Dolphine is kinda still broken :S
ohai
oh god
I can only run Twilight princess at about 28 FPS.
Mr_Popo:
itsa me Popo
it's a PSP for crying out loud
Yeah, best one out of the most though
it's just a LITTLE ahead of a PS1
It's not
You said energy core
why is that energy core alive?
bc it is
A PSP is probably as powerful as a gamecube
pokuuuuuuu
that's how anime works, just roll with it
probably a tad less
hmmm
5GB might work
In fact, it should
But what Graphics card have you got?
ohai
Is it a HD radion 1080?
its a AMD Athlon 4200HD
hey otakon, is it just me or in Kingdoms of amalur, are the fae serious jerks
it's low end
Ingwaz: they seem to be jerks
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it's a 4.3 on that scale they have
It's me....I was the turkey all along!
out of 7
otakon: glad its not just me
Ingwaz: ESPECIALLY The Widow
dat bitch
i dont remember her being more of a jerk than the majority of the fae
Yeah, you possibly want a better Graphics card.
then again...i killed her
Fazana: I haz no monies.....
Neither do I, neither do I.
what's happenin'?
I just got here and already I hear about murder
You could give it a whirl anyway
hmmm
and it it doesn't work, then you can save up or something.
*looks closer* Gundam?
I only have 255mb of dedicated graphics memory
hey Sundaysmile
/me is a PC
can I boost that?
Hey there everypony ^_^
hey proto
hey scoots
hiya ScootaChicken
ohai scootachicken
y'know, I just realised that 'Discorded Harmony' is a really good name for a band
:)
Hello Sundaysmile ScootaChicken and flutter_spin
brb, finding musical bronies in England to form a band with
I presume so
Fazana: atm I can't I'm out of work, been looking for work for near 6 months now
hey kwak
As long as you don't fry the motherboard
ohai otakon
I presume you can expand
hey Fazana, you live in England right?
Yup
it's tough otakon, nowadays you just have to take what you can get
Ayup everypony!
>.>
heya Globetrotter
Hello Globetrotter
Why? :s
hey trotter
What's this, a gundam tile game?
Fazana: you musical in any way?
No, BUT my step dad is.
He has a small band.
your step dad a brony?
Nope :/
I GOT SOME PONY TOYS.
I'm the only Brony in family
Sundaysmiles; trotter is so close to trots which means diarrhoea
But on the good side, I'm teaching myself Piano and Guitar
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT PONY TOYS THEY ARE?!
we call it "the shits"Globetrotter, trotter is in fact a revered name where I'm from
Plushie?
um pretty?
where are you from Sundaysmile?
OKAY, IT IS -
Britain, Scotland
I'm in England
I got Cherry Berry and GLOW IN THE DARK TWILIGHT FUCKING SPARKLE! :D
lol
Trotter actually makes me think pigs feet
Never heard of Del-Boy Trotter? :P
Trotter makes me thing walking horses
:( the broadcast just doesn't stay playing. hmm.
I've heard of Del-boy
Well they dont sell ponies here ...

GIGA
DRILL
*sadface*
If you are on Chrome, switch to EE or FF
BREAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Miss.
hell no
Okay, guess not
massive explosiooooooooooooooooooons
not a chance in hell
This is the first time it did this
i heard you like explosions... so we put explosions in your explosions, dawg
EE Fazana?
Internet exploer
Made a typo
ScootaChicken: sorry, was only a joke! don't be angry
oh okay thought so
otakon: you disgust me.
Aidene mech is REALLY weird looking
man its snowin alot where i am damn!
im not usually one to complain about streams...but this game is very boring :s
what happened ScootaChicken
ScootaChicken: It was only a joke man! C'mon!
my mom is repeating everything the forecaster says over the phone
otakon: I am not Welsh.
"Snow is coming" she shouts
09,01>SRW
09,01>boring
I joked around and almost ALMOST called him a welshman
Never call me Welsh.
Boob robot? Oh Japan!
ever again.
Yes you are ScootaChicken!
Well if she says it everyday, she has to be right eventually
09,01you are clearly a hard to entertain person
ScootaChicken: I didn't and I won't
super robot wars is never boring
Welsh!
stop it!
Weeeeeeeeeksh!
Robot wars is one of the best sports
Globetrotter: Don't you dare.
in Japan
Fazana: it's the national pasttime!
lmao
they just don't let the rest of us know
ScootaChicken
Weeeee.... rather not.
otherwise we'd want in
I wish I understood Japanese
NewDCD: if there was some conflict in the game or an actual fight i suppose it would be fine, but its boring as hell to just watch the same repetetive cutscenes as your opponents constantly miss
it's more fun to play if you don't
I would try and learn, but quite frankly, I can't be arsed
just issue random commands
and watch the "wtf" commence
If I did learn though, I would translate so many stuffs, like GK2
its so predictable
09,01I'm sorry for being good at SRW, Morty ; 3
Morty: you can fast forward them or skip them altogether
im not saying the game is bad
personally
dont listen to the crazy people NewDCD, this game is fun to watch
I don't know. I like knowing the story, and I can't do that without understanding what they say
I get a kick out of them everytime
im saying watching someone with an invincible set up is boring
Right, afk for some Chinese food.
what u been up to ScootaChicken
flutter_spin: try the OG1 games on the GBA
I just noticed that boob robot has nipples...
09,01thing is, if you don't play well, you get your ass kicked to kingdom come in like two turns
Sundaysmile: those are eye actually
alexxm: not much, what about you?
not much either
makes sense....?
i used to play Field Commander on my old PSP that was fun for a while...
ScootaChicken: I will never again joke that you are Welsh. I hereby swear on this IRC with witness'.
i wonder what will happen next? same cutscene ive been watching for hours followed by an enmy miss?
lets find out
so what ScootaChicken what was going on a few minutes ago
I barely have the patience for tile-based games
ScootaChicken is so much more awesome than welsh
otakon: Good.
ScootaChicken I swear you're irish.
okay good, now I'll brb I need my food
Morty: if you dont like it, you can always turn off the screen... some of us like this and dont appreciate the complaining...
um did Eureka just go super Kawaii?
that's not a big gun
whoa
of course it would be critical
robot lady gonna get ass slammed
Hey why is the gun guy always shooting each others crotches ??
THIS is a big gun http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~kkc273/PinkiePieHiRes.png
sorry, its just gotten really repetetive
I saw that comin'
ill stop
huh huh?
Partee Cannoru!
I guess I can go watch the latest episodes of Alcatraz
flutter_spin: have fun come back soon
Big O?
looks like it
Big O... <3
yes
i'm probably heading out now see u guys later
LOL
and SURE PROMISE FTW!
It is him
Bye alex
cya alexxm
bye alexxm
such class...
cya later alexxm come back soon!
lol
still needs Big Duo...
Midnight_Tempest: was a boss in the first game
is that the one somepony called boob bot?
Big O levelled up!"
no
>_< bring it back then
Roger did
the mechs don't level up
but the pilots stats effect the mech
anypony know how SUpreme COmmander 2 is?
they should...
by percentage
YOU CAN however ugrade a mechs stats
with money
supreme commander 2 is ok... not as good as the first one
along with their weapons too
i couldn t find a demo for the firstone on xbox
but no, Pilots level up
its not? How?
KwakLad: it's perfectly balanced
oh wait hold on wrong game
nvm that comment
lol
I was talking about SRT not Supreme Commander
okay brb
Supreme Commander 2 was made to get people into that style of game... it's super easy but really well balanced, the MP is suprisingly good
Hiya guys
oh ok
Hello
almost sounds like mlp music there
Hi everypony.
What game had an unbalanced side?
Hi
hiya Red_Pegasus
Anime?
hiya Red_Pegasus
Red_Pegasus: SUPER ROBOT WARS!
Actually a game
we just defeated the boob robot of doom
its kinda reminding me of Total Annihilation, if ya dont know what it is its an old 90s pc game
it was glorious
Isn't that the cartoon in Japan that caused spazms?
Sundaysmile: that wasbn't the boob robot
Red_Pegasus: no, that's Pokemon
all cartoons in japan cause seizures...
ahem
japanese people are just weak to seizures
all cartoons MADE in japan
its super effective against them
cause seizures
not in
otakon: i know what i meant... dont make me glare at you through the internet
Who is streaming?
well.... the west edits animes for western audiences
im sure im not the only one here who watched the porygon episode and didnt get a seizure
09,01I'm streaman
/me glares at Midnight_Tempest through the internet
japanese must edit western content for seizures
lol
:D
NewDCD: How can you understand the japanse?
/me bursts into flames
/me puts out Midnight_Tempest AGAIN
stop doing that!
will you stop lol
-_-
10 damage
that was your fault otakon...
whats up Morty?
my glaring?
sorry
huh?
The girl sounds like Fluttershy.
09,01by playing the translated games in this series + this: http://akurasu.net/wiki/Super_Robot_Wars/Z2
she sounds stoned...
Red_Pegasus: she basically IS Fluttershy
that's Princess Nia
nah, Morty is just tired of seeing the same cutscenes over and over... it is an RPG...
"daughter" of Lord Genome
from Gurren Lagann
the cutscenes are cool
09,01think I'm gonna switch to the Masoukishin SRW after this
this has been on for hours though
09,01God knows I'm getting my ass kicked there
Supreme Commander 1 and 2 are just remakes of Total Annihilation it looks like
MEOW
09,01and it's still the same stage <3
:F
:D
Yay boobies
oh DashWithRainbows
you silly filly
jiggly
That was a fast reaction ScootaChicken.
yoko, the original "when im" video

The curse is in effect, nothing can stop it now
I've gone through 5 xboxes due to E 34 and RRoD
They do.
but this one is FINE
bc it IS
Tehy just don't have red LED's

09,01otakon: I hope you didn't have to BUY those 5 XBoxes
This looks like a TV show.

The_4th_Wall: don't you mean Black Snooty?

Yeah
o god

um what is this?
I see Masaki
00,10Yeah like I said yesterday I would show more if the stream is free.
but what is this?
09,01Masaki's exclusive OG game
NewDCD: he gets an exclusive? WHERES ZENGARS EXCLUSIVE?
Actually, I'm getting a 'webpage not available' error as well now that I refreshed the stream page.
oddd
NewDCD this an emulator?
09,01Masaki was the first OG ever...so he got one in Super Nintendo
09,01and this is a remake
argh
Youtube on xbox needs a My little pony portal
damn stupid Masaki
09,01they made a sequel to this game as well and bundled it with this remake
Still error 404. Restarting computer.
still cant read kanji. I bought a study game for DS on how tor write kanji symbols...but its in japanese so I dont know what each symbol means :'(
09,01>stupid Mazak

NewDCD damn you rich people...
Under discover
The_4th_Wall: Zengar shatters you many times
09,01I'm poor ;___;
Iron robot used move, it done 100 damage.
This sort of reminds me of Advanced wars...
nice graphics
The quality is really really good
not just the graphics
DashWithRainbows: they are both turn based strategy games
:(
True.
Music sounds like older FF
No stream for me :(
09,01they're both SRW games
^^^ rome total war
Best of the TW series
wtf is THAT!
I won't ask anyone to refresh to check if it's just a problem on my end :P
OMG
DEAMON ROBOT!
hmmm
Cybuster looks different in this one
who invited CHaos Marines?
09,01it isn't Cybuster
09,01it's Jaohm
hmmm?
09,01Mazaki's Elemental Lord before he gets Cybuster
hmmm...Civilization Revolution or Dead Rising 2?
oh
Dead Rising 2
DR2
All the Way
09,01he also uses it in Alpha Gaiden
NewDCD: it gets blown to hell doesn't it
@<Lasharus> It is, just refreshed and stream is playing fine for me.
lol
It is pretty good.
ok
NO!
09,01Jaohm, The Elemental Lord of Shimmering Heat
CIVR!
09,01dunno cause later another character inherits Jaohm
y?
DR2 is really really repetitive
NewDCD: thanks
NewDCD: Guess you can say, he is hot. YYYYEAH
ofc the old man is a lecher
All you do is wait, kill zombies, rescue noobs
How to delete Skype account
Fazana but kills time and is best with a friend.
?
09,01funny you say that, considering Masaki is a babe magnet
09,01COUGHRYUUNECOUGH
I prefer L4D IMO
^
09,01oh yeah otakon
09,01Valsione is in this
Because that series is sexy as hell Fazana.
NewDCD: you mean Lune correct? Miss Flapper Girl herself
imma probably get tht soon
NewDCD: SWEET!
09,01so DCD can go full RYUUSEI
L4D 1 is better in some respects
But L4D 2 is also better in some too
I prefer L4D2.
It really is a pickle which one to get
NewDCD: so Ryuusei has a thing for Super Robots shaped like women huh?
Anyone here see my ponyville helicopter last night?
09,01dunno what respects L4D1 is better than 2, aside from some custom campaigns
now that is an off fetish tbh
woo
:D
it's the potato again
easy Fazana, L4D1 for those new to L4D and L4D2 when they complete it.
L4D has got a few small things that are better
I am NOT a potato.
But the main thing is it's scarier
I got changed back.
Duuuuh.
09,01I was thinking of drawing Ryuusei giving a love letter to a human-sized Valsione, both of them in school uniforms, and Valsione looking bashful
09,01because HILAROUS
always dark...
Mhmm.
but hordes are small as hell
Dew eet DCD
/me NO.
DEW EET/
NewDCD: DO EET!!!!!
Guys, have fun here, I am going to bed, Good Night everypony.
No no no no no no no no no no NO.
I'm going to upload more MLP colored planes
night scavender
Night Scavender
I shall NOT turn myself into a POTATO.
NewDCD: no realy I think the only way it could be better if he's handing to Valsione when it's regular sized
imma make me a couple hot dogs
brb
I'm not.
Nope, looks like either my system refuses to acknowledge Veemi's existence, or something's wrong on their end.
09,01...I'll draw that as well
fuck
Could someone do me a favour and try to reach veemi.com?
After that Convo, I wanna play L4D now.

Sumiva: It says 'This webpage is not availableThe server at www.veemi.com can't be found, because the DNS lookup failed. DNS is the network service that translates a website's name to its Internet address. This error is most often caused by having no connection to the Internet or a misconfigured network. It can also be caused by an unresponsive DNS server or a firewall preventing Google Chrome from accessing the net
and that's what it says.
13huh

ScootaChicken: hell no, they have some good songs.

Why would it?
ScootaChicken: you are a very bad person and you should be ashamed of yourself.

I SWEAR he said Wakka
otakon: Baka
otakon: no, but she was in incredible pain and had no way to be turned back. it was either kill her quickly, or keep her alive and allow that little girl and her beloved dog to waste away in pain and fatigue for possibly years, if she didn't just starve herself like her mother did.

"Um...captain, can I kinda go somewhere else, I got a GF" "Well dump her" "That's horrible!"

she's got the big eyes for him
Was that a bomb of awesomenes?

Awww yeah, I've finally gotten far enough down the Big List O' Fics to a HGG crossover.

Hey guys...
Dashie_Dashie: One of the big questions of life.
bacon everybacon *waves goodbacon*
:o
I think I may ask my friend out.
I think Sheska could give that Read or Die girl a run for her money
lol
What do you ponies think?
??
Syndicate: Well, do it.
O.o
I totally think you should-
think of wat?
haha
And make it pony-related.
Go for it Syndicate!
I mean, she's drawn me 3 ponies
/me yawns
O.O
3! In one day!
Syndicate: marry her.
Give her a late pony Valentine's card.
^^
I will.
That's awesome Syndicate
Syndicate: she's a keeper!
^
Focker?
is his first name Gaylord?
Fluttershy, my favorite
You should totally go out with her.
Pinkie pie, my second
If she's drawing ponies for you, she obviously can't hate you.
And vinyl scratch.
05if she's a brony, then its taboo not to try
Ponkey Poe
The stream is really laggy
Wrek is right.
DO EET
Eeyup.
It keeps having to buffer every 15 sec
What is this persons name? :P
Syndicate: you like her right? you enjoy being in her company and such? THEN DO EEETTTT FILLY!
She is indeed a pegasister
and it's skipping frames
Fazana: not for me!
/me does hthe happy dance of lag freeness
a black man speaking japanese :D
I'll switch to Chrome soon
So...Tom Cruise is possibly a brony. Thoughts?
Syndicate you silly filly, go go go go!
Which ep are we up to?
is that the official word for women who like MLP
:D
ENVY!
0_o
Dont be a scootaloo Syndicate! Go for it! :$
Ahh balls to it.
Brb
he''s got the shiny glasses
I'll do it tonight.
05i think he should stay with his cientology
sonofabitch!
I hope you don't get friendzoned like me, Syndicate .
He has ace stealth skills!
/me doesn't know much about Tom Cruice
D:
Sparkles
Dont say that ScienceLawnchair >.<
05DOMO!
Syndicate: You should totally pay one of those oatmeal fan animation people to create an invitation for her.
OH its him, I remember him
Pay them all your money if you have to.
Oh hi, LordCelestia.
It's a very real possibility, RaveBrony. Can't ignore the facts.
hiya LordCelestia welcome
00,10Sup LC
LordCelestia returns.

ohai LC
Yeah, i know, but its not something people want to hear :D
heya lc
I wish I had half of Armstrongs charisma
He miss the mass amount of bacon pics we posted last night.
missed*
and NOW it's buffering
00,10Sorry guys if it's laging I cant do much more to fix it on my end.
and skipping frames for me
argh
oh well
me too
it's fine for me.
00,10I am not seeing it at all
^
Sumica: it was only a hiccup
It's alright for me
I get the feeling Commanders gonna die soon
I forget his name -_-
Fazana: just watch
00,10I already have the video bitrate lower then i like
WOAAAAAAH
dat ping
Fazana: that's MAJOR ALEX LOUIS ARMSTRONG!!!
No
I was on about Colonal
Not Mr. Sparkles
Colonal Mustang
He won't never die
Dat lie~
Fazana: damn straight and DON'T FORGET IT!
I did't forget t
:D
I forgot Mustang, not Armstrong
Like I said
Why do people hold their suitcases/bags like that in animes?
How can I forget such manliness.
That's not very comfortable at all.
ScienceLawnchair: like what?
why not?
Like Ed was just then.,
over the shoulder?
I've don it before
I have
just a way is all
Oooo, will we get to Ep 19 today? :D That'll be awesome.
It hurts my collar bone

CK|Asleep: You're the best sleep walker I've seen
Inorite

Cuz now I can't get it out of my head
00,10so many flashbacks
Toooo much pudding.

/me pats Fazana on the back
Gotta go shopping before I can watch, hopefully will be back by Ep 19. It's one of my absolute favorites. :3
they didn't develop him that much in this one
Hughes is best pony
*Sniff* Hughes....D:
05its a fantastic cover imo
/me gives Fazana a hug
CK|Asleep: be quick about it! THIS IS 18!

Lust is the busty long-haired one, Gluttony is the fat one, Envy is the androgynous one, Greed is the Dead one, Wrath is the Eye patch guy, and Sloth and Prid haven't been shown yet.
hmm.....she looks legit
Greed is the dead one, roflmao!!
and now Lust too
00,10We saw a bit of sloth
Greed got pwned by lava
/me thinks String_Shredder saw too much of Death Nothe
lost all his 0 diamonds
greed would suck at minecraft
RAWRity: Sloth has been show already, he's the manmountain.
otakon: couldn't remember if we'd seen him at this point yet.
The guy who fought Armstrong?
I wasn#t really watching him
Only Armstrong
He'd probably keep all his things on him and then fall in lava
RAWRity Sloth was shown...
paradise92: yes, otakon has pointed that out already
RAWRity i'm a bastard
Aaah!! Im so excited my pony drawing is near complete!!

Welcome back flutter_spin
to... nothing? aw
:D:D:D
D:
Sry. I had to watch the Bronies react to Teenagers React video
or maybe... CaROLINE
that was hilarious
flutter_spin: theres one of those?
Yup
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/bronies-react-to-teens-react-to-my.html
flutter_spin: That one is hilarious
flutter_spin I'm not a man? *evil stare*
I can't believe I had to watch it about 3 or 4 times over before I started to piece things together
I never met any of these guys or had a passion to Inception
Had to go through their stuff. No wonder the one guy sounded familiar. He did "Love Me Cheerilee"
Yeah, those guys in that video are quite well known
flutter_spin: who the HELL is Dusty?
The manliest brony ever
and why is he maniler than I?
The guy with the serious moustache
damn it
NO!
I really don't get why Winry continues to wear a skirty that could barely function as a belt.
http://gd666.tumblr.com/
I SHALL NOT BE BEATTEN
*skirt
Yeah. Dusty sort of threw out the "I am the manliest man ever and I like MLP"
Because Japanese. DUH
This is Equestria's aircraft hangar
RAWRity: you haven't seen her strip of cloth bra/workwear have you?
*Enter otakon's beard training montage*
Dusty is wrong though
The manliest man ever is Armstrong
and he saw Ross'
otakon: at least that one sort of makes sense. You're working with machnery, oil, all that stuff YOu want something that isn't gonna be in the way.
Well, he is our representation of "you can be a man and like MLP"
RAWRity: but not overalls like ANY OTHER MECHANIC?
You best start doing beard pushups
otakon: we don't see any other using it.
Its kind of odd to see someone step up and say "I'm proud to be a brony" out in the open like that
*those
RAWRity: we don't see any other young female automail workers either?
WAT!?
hi all :D

It's pretty bad for me.

Fazana, that's what little means right? shitton of lag

Blindly follow orders. Don't question anything.

Hey guys, just got on. So is the stream down?

Why does this remind me of Star Trek? What it means to be a soldier.
tgl1992: refresh

"It weren't your men..."
No, now I have 2 windows to read.
otakon thanks!
How the hay is it possible for me to hear the sound of Fluttershy's yay while Pink Floyd is playing?
Mustang is actually a brony
It was right in the middle of "In the Flesh?", too!
LALALA

I have got to stop shoveling Pringles down my throat.
I want pringles
Fueld up
Back to 1.5 litres
CriticKitten: Are you using a spade?
I'm gonna end up eating the whole darn container if I don't stop.
just skip till he starts to "transform" into ssj2 sry i needed to come back
to post this :S
lol
big mac is awesome
I want drugs! Now!
interesting
Pringles ARE drugs
lol
Druggles?
YAY. It's time for the fun. :D
SAYS WHO"
People are drugs
Pringles contain acid
because they are so addictive, and it hurts you when your hand gets stuck in the container
Go doggy!

Did you ponies see the Heart's Desire comic?
:D
NO
Don't think so
For someone to not know anything about the series, that came out of nowhere
BURN HIM TO A CRISP. THEN EAT HIM.
watabitch
It's around the front page of EQD.
It's pretty good
flutter_spin: what came out of nowhere?
Dat doggy. Obeying orders.
XD
The whole hand = boomboom
Roy is the man with the boomstick-for-a-hand. :o
flutter_spin: his gloves have a special symbol drawn on them that allows for the use of flame alchemy.
00,10the flame alchmist
I could ask questions all day like what is the deal with the giant metal man, but whatever
and there made of a special cloth
I'm going with it. Just like Pink Floyd
00,10the gloves alow the creeation of a spark, and the circle alows him to controll it.
"i guess thats hard to believe" no responce except for gun being loaded
And IIRC, the gloves are slightly different, one allowing for big boom and the other is more controlled for pinpoint targeting
Though that's not always kept to...
Yu Yu Hakusho was weird like that too.
00,10dat music
^
It reminds me of godzilla
NO! Never split the party!
flutter_spin: essentially, there was an accident that ended up with Al's body being lost entirely, and his brother sacrificed his arm to graft Al's soul onto that armor.
Haven't you played D&D, Roy?
D:<
00,10ohhi lust
ohhhhhh

Barry (one with the ax) was part of a government experiment that essentially did the same thing.

Good to hear happy continuity announcers

flutter: He broke the water down into Hydrogen and Oxygen gas, which made it flammable. Explosively so.
baddass scar
doesn't get any better.
Dashie_Dashie|TF2: I'm doing the exact same thing ^^
flutter_spin: alchmy allows them to change chemical compositions. They separated the Hyrdogen and Oxygen in the water to make for a highly explosive atmosphere
And down he goes~

Definitely Brotherhood. It just executes everything better
hi
I like bleach´ better than this one :O...or Ghost in the shell Ftw!
Al just realized, HE COULD RUST!
Ghost in the Shell I've watched. Bleach I have watched a few episodes.
Al should have daedric not iron.
n00b
flutter: Don't worry, I won't, just saying that it gets better still
hi
Hes like TinMan From Wizard of Oz
apples
Bleh, FMA is much better than Bleach. For one thing, FMA actually has an ending.
O.o
NOOO
Barry!
owned?
Doesnt need an ending, just have to be good waste of time
Bleach came on much later in the evening. I couldn't stay up to watch it.
second, the supporting character in FMA actually DO SOMETHING rather than just sit there to cheer on Ed.
^
Fucking headshot.
Dat rage

More guns!
Out of ammo?
Ohai you fillies that are very silly

He definetly emphasises the term " KILL IT WITH FIRE"
did he made a game breaker?
Well, at least I didn't watch this before I went to sleep
LOL
emangamer: DA being piddly with the PDF again. Download it if you can.
Roy is the very definition of a badass

He should totally go on Furry duty

And that is why Roy Mustang is a badass. Fatal stab wound? Screw you, I'll sear the wound closed and torch your ass. :|
aw man, Wrath didn't get to do anything.

ohai gumri
ohai Gumri
Hi Hi~ Gumri
and RAWRity
Roy gets the best fights, too. XD
more fluttershy
Erm what Episode of MLP is the best?
I don't know, but when I do quotations, I always spell them badly. :o
flutter_spin: you think THAT ending was extreme? WAIT UNTIL THE FINALE.
Roy makes his fights the best fights
Season 2 Episode 2
Hello Gumri
/me gets in the shower to wash hischest
Oh god the finale
this ending is best ending
that wasn't the finale?
That was so absurd and so awesome
Really? That is a 2 parter.
OH MY WORD THERES MORE
a finale that is TEN EPISODES LONG
Why do they Make Sing´along songs out of Everything they can get their Hooves on!
did i miss a lot since yesterday? i have no idea what's going on
The finale of Brotherhood kicks so much ass. XD
well imma go watch this. Goodbye
Brotherhood finale is the sex
Maybe I should start from the beginning and watch the whole thing
I never fully understood the finale Oo
I hate being thrown in the middle like this
KELP
So do I.
Wow, episode 20 already
flutter_spin: that'd be a good idea. Or, if you want, read the manga
ekips are you sure you are thinking of the brotherhood finale?
oh hey, is missed about 4 eps, no wonder i'm confused
I don't like the read :( I'm not a comic person
....i also missed everything before that
Oh!
Is it in Manga? :o
ROAR
Fazana: eeyup. Fullmetal Alchemist
Y U NO TELL ME!
Brotherhood finale makes sense, crappy other one ending makes no sense at all
It's worth watching, flutter. The series is really a very good one. It's one anime I recommend to everyone, even if they don't generally watch anime, if only because it's a show that most anyone can enjoy.
yeah I guess, but it's been a while, maybe I am mixing with the normal
damn this show is going fast :S
So what, watch all whatever 30 episodes of Brotherhood?
What about the original series?
64
This is really funny, full of action, no filler, the perfect show.
flutter_spin: 63
There's more than 30. I think there's....yeah, 60-some
Like who sings along on this :S....i cant even understand a Word there saying
64 exactly
flutter_spin this is the original...this one sticks to the manga
10 of those episodes are JUST THE FINALE
Brotherhood finale is best finale.
I LIKE CHICKEN I LIKE LIVER MEOW MIX MEOW MIX PLEASE DELIVER!!!

*cough*
dat short skirt...
Dun goofed, Ling
DubZbrony: as a joke.
ponies don't wear clothes
fan service. She is technically naked.
String_Shredder: and yet we never get a panty shot. Brotherhood keeps it classy.
We don't normally wear clothes...
Back
Rofl...so the memes where right :P
I didn't get it at first until I watched it with the stream when everyone shouted it out
Who hear memeroized every song in the series so far
me
what's this brotherhood i hear so much talking about?
Flutterpop: Better question is who doesn't?
SO TRUE
FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
i see
Dark_Horst: the show we're watching. It's called Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
The music in this series is pretty perfect for each scene it occurs in.
NIIIINAAAAAA
NIIIINAAAAAAAA
;_;
Nina ',..,'
Nina ;0;
Is it safe to be freaked out right now?
IIRC, nina's fate was brought up more times than Digimon Tamers flashed back to Leomon's death.
CriticKitten: BUT HAVE YOU MEMORIZED THE PERFECT STALLION son
Well, I'm off for tonight, bye everyone
bye Jim
Night jim
Take care Jim.
...
It's basically morning
....Nina. ;_;
wuh
how come the ones with german names are always the bad/elusive guys in anime?
It's morning somewhere
once this show is over, we need to show the Dub outtakes.
Dark_Horst prejudices
let me guess, more explosion time?
Hoenheim isnt bad
actually
Nina's sad, though Hughes' death always brings me to tears.
if we can
Dark_Horst: well, to be fare, Elric is a fairly german name.
and what morty said
He;s just a bastard
Big mac stares upon u
can we get Fairy Tail on this streams?
Don't deny it
on these*
elric? wut?
Hoenheim isn't a bastard either
OR ELSE
paradise92: fuck no. Fairy Tail can eat me.
This stream needs something
..
More ponies!
hoenheim is a hero period

awesome
Ponies are tomorrow, and I won't be there :(.
RAWRity...rlly? are you for real??? fairy tail will continue after bleach and naruto are over...it is because naruto and bleach will soon be over...
Why does he sound like he's regurgitating?
RAWRity start watching new anime dude
{\\\]]
paradise92: I DO watch new anime. And Fairy Tail sucks ass.
Bronys are epic
In soviet russia anime watches you
....
Big mac would certainly agree
Only new anime I've watched is Persona 4
the dead body was a lie
No way
I bet she's still alive!
That's horrifying.
Bleach jumped the shark 3 years ago in the manga, Naruto has been hit and miss at best for the better part of a decade.
Anyone Got some cider -_-
Fazana...she's not
Cider?
00,10that's right, you mom was a dude
I have some

Argh ^^, thanks, much better nauw
hell, telling me to watch new anime, THIS anime we're watching right now isn't even 3 years old.
Inorite
YOU SAID THAT
RAWRity but it finished...
why does that not being his mom mean anything? What does it mean? anyone?
YO
BRONY STATE}
Wait, this isn't 3 years... but people have talked about it when I was a teenager
hello Flutterpop
/me gets in the shower to wash his chest and feet
flutter_spin: there was another anime back in the early 2000s
00,10there has been 2 animes caled FMA flutter_spin
Yeah, the original, right?
Brotherhood is three years old.
but the manga wasn't finished at the time, so they branched off from it half-way throuhg the story.
the original had an... odd ending
00,10brotherehood is based more on the manga
what episode is this?
Brotherhood's definitely the better one IMO.
So the older one is "odd" but the newer one is a remix/remake and is better?
00,10oh look eqd already issueing a retraction
3lol EqD fail x3
odd is an understatement
Thank godness
lol @ EQD
what episode is this?
Sumica
especially that movie
I guess hes not one.....oh well
flutter: Yes
flutter_spin: Brotherhood being better is a bit dependent on your tastes. it's more accurate to say taht Brotherhood is just very faithful to the manga.
00,10Morty
The original FMA got ahead of its manga source material, so it made stuff up.
what episode is this Sumica?
he gets mad just as winry
Ohhhh. See I don't care about the manga.
Brotherhood was made near the end of the manga's run and follows it faithfully.
00,10it's um.....20 I think
HAH
Boot to the head.
But Brotherhood is the recommended version of the two, eh? They both tell identical stories?
Mostly.
flutter_spin: I love brotherhood than the original crap
NO
not at all!
its a little different than the origional from what I can tell
flutter_spin: no. about a third of the way through, the stories branch off into completely different stories.
Like I said, the old FMA didn't follow the manga because it got ahead of the series.
00,10they are close till around ep14
Darf14: it's a LOT differnt.
So it started making stuff up
And....didn't do a good job of it.
your right, its a lot not a little
00,10then brotherhodd goes above and beyond
Whether Brotherhood or the Original is better is a matter of taste.
its totally different Flutter_spin. People that say otherwise are on very powerful drugs
Lol!
I grew up with the origional so by default I prefer the origional
Ed was friend-zone'd due to height....sad. :(
00,10I watched the orginal first as well, this is better in my book.
Kind of reminds me of the OVA version of Ah My Goddess and the series. Or even Tenchi Muyo or Tenchi Universe
CriticKitten: well technically, it's Winry's fault he's short.
Dat Dupstep /)oO(\ Keeps me awake, dat and Too much Coffee
Anypony want to play TF2 in a bit?
Yeah, that's true.
She did a poor job with the automail IIRC.
How did the original end? I remember it being something like Ed being in a train in the 40's type europe or something
The "Original" is bullshit made up by people who started following the creator's story then they caught up to where the author was and made up their own terrible shit
CriticKitten: it's because the automail is so heavy, it stunted his growth.
I prefer Brotherhood even with seeing the original three times.
naw play Bf3 instead :P
Ah, right.
No
It's because he HATES milk
Brotherhood is the true original because it follows the real story
I can clarify it.
It's been a while so I couldn't remember all the details.
sry. automail = derpy. I have no idea what you are talking about.
I hate milk
Morty: I certainly wouldn't call it terrible. It's a lot more out there, but it can stand on its own.
I'm short.
00,10Full metal pony: Bronyhood.
Sumica if only.
hello everypony
What was that one series I watched. The samurai with the glasses.
Wrek?
Hey RainbowJack.
RAWRity: I guess you are right. Its just terrible compared to Brotherhood and its finale was just bad
flutter: Samurai Champloo?
Samurai Jack?
yes. thats it
Champloo
That was good
Though, there's a few with samurai-with-glasses, that's just one of the better known ones. :p
is wrek here?
Fazana...I love you for that.
Samurai Jack xD
What is up my bronies ?
The ceiling
O shit...
the sky
00,10Wrek is probably lurking
^
lurking is fun
Let's ping the ever-loving heck out of him.
Last I saw he was watching the show with us. :p

We are watching FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as we compare it to the original anime
We were literally talking about the ceiling.

00,10How ever some shows I am fine with dubs such as bebop and Gits
yeah
Is there any Site to post and upload Pony drawings for rating and such?...Got alot i want to show the Internet already :D?
Depends how well it's done
@Sumica and dragon ball z :S
Some series I wouldn't mind watching with dubs. Others I wouldn't care.
F-zero Gp Legend was dubbed pretty well
this ending theme makes me wet myself
(not pee)
XD
00,10I gave up on dbz back when it was on toonami
Actually i love the Green Dub version of Dragon Ball Z :) :)
Random Freestyle Art of ponies
Yeah. I prefer Dragon Ball.
Toonami good CNT bad
:D
Jello
just be glad you didn't have to see the abomination that was GT
00,105min to blow up a planet. 12 eps later still not blowen up
FOR GREEN DUB:Saiyans - Space Warrior
really? I started when Vegeta entered and then I stopped right when Cell came in
Got few Paintings too ^^
I prefer DB, too
dbz GT was a disgrace to a great show
is any one streaming
Am I the only one that thought Dragon Ball was better than DBZ?
GT was really BAD
^
i liked DBZ better
How bad was GT? Never saw that one
Me gusta DB
I liked the martial arts of DB
GT shat all over DBZ cannon too
I did go back and watch some Dragonball. I don't prefer one over the other
Syndicate not the only one
Oh yeah!
oh fuck did i miss Roy vs Lust?
Syndicate DB you could see the fighting...DBZ only flashes and pictures
lol morty

Roy Mustang IS best pony
No

NO
Roy ain't a pony
NIOO
No.
Pretty much anything on Toonami. It was THE place to watch shows.
Hughes is best pony
BUT
No
Chuck Norris is best pony
did that guys just smoke a hotdog?
Roy doesn't have "fights", he has one-sided beatdowns
Chuck Norris Schmuch schmorris
Louise Best Pegasis
Suddenly, Fazana dies.
Chck Norris doesn't have fights
He doesn't need to
in that case mustang is best horse
Chuck Norris Vs. Armstrong, armstrong wins
He loojks at people.
I killed Chuck Norris.
Armstrong definitely wins.
Plus I'm not dead.
Guys!
Fazana: Agreed, i have a great dislike of the Norris
00,10Roy plays the goof in most fights but when he gets to fight it's a curb stomp
Guys...
So the main guy and the metalman are brothers?
I don't hate Norris, he's just ovverated
Hey everypony!
If Chuck Norris is still alive when I'm old...
flutter_spin yep.
That explains a lot
hey Stinkomanfan
I may kill him, just to become a legend
Howdy StinkomanFan.
Fazana: i dislike because overarated (not hate)
You know what manga/anime I think lost its way

Leaving the middle child ignored
There was an hour video of someone explaining about the original series on youtube. I won't link it, but it explains it best
rainowdash always dresses in style!
Since G4 has been the best, G1 and G3 were kinda bad, which leaves G2 out to be ignored
anthroponymorphic ponies?
Suddenly, Nina
Nopony said if it's good or bad or horrifying, It may amaze you people (Especially Halo Fans) that there is a number before 3
But there is
hi All!
sometimes I dream that me and rainbow dash fly away together forever
00,10the realy odd thing about g2 was how they lived in houses and went to school and had parties.......wait.
The guy said G1 was little girl happiness, G2 was girls in the real world, G3 was cuddley to the extreme
;_;
hi Mutterguy
Nina. :(
damn silence
G2 wasn't bad like I said
lol
05they were only out to get the laid in g2
The voce acting was bad and the styles were wierd
....oh no.
guys, G3>G4

kill him and make some KFC
I remember this too. OH GOD.
G3 has a far better animation style, and the character development is very good
the voice acting is also of a much higher quality than G4.
If you put Nyan Cat in a toaster, does it come out as rainbow dash?
So spill the frigging beans on G3.6
You know, I feel like I'm gonna hve to find a way to keep my mom from touching computers soon.

Glacia: I doubt it, consider i've been on for like 20 minutes total today

I just got back myself

Seriously, discussing cupcakes gets you a ban

Jiggle: he's a mod, he's allowed to do that
PINKIE PIE WILL GET TIRED OF HER OWN FLESH SOMEDAY
Wrek can you do me a favor and kick me so I can focus?

Flutterpop was trolling earlier too

and thus the patience was done
RAWR
Seriously, not a good idead to mess with wrek atm. He's had like 4 hours sleep in the past week. He has no patience left to test.

RAWRity: typo already

Flutterpop: would you like to stick around and enjoy the shows here?

Knock him out with the nearest pony related objects, then force him too watch all of the so far season 2 till he starts starving too death. wait until he is open too reason and then force him too read my little dashie. Then make him a pinkie pie cake and watch him eat it. Slowly.

Thanks Meanwhile
Twilightsparkle, TheGreatAndPowerfulTrixie really thinks you should get out more, too much time inside your house is bad for you.
KwakLad: as in, gender neutral pronoun "they"
Refer to my last comment regarding my opinion on the effort it took to share that information with you.
Study is always good and you're probably due for some books your self
/me covers himself in wool and curls up on the couch
RAWRity as in you dont specifically know who, like saying 'they' when refering to 'conspiricies'?

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Are you talking to yourself?
You have a good night as well KwakLad. :D

Meanwhile: What are you talkin about TheGreatAndPowerfulT is talking to Twilightsparkle here, i'm no crazy pony to be talking with myself

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2138/
Well, since realistically I've only played the game for 98 minutes, have only 3 achieves and suck at it, I'm just gonna pass.
I wonder why I havent bought that game yet, I should buy it
scoot-scootaloo is taking on my challenge
aint that right scoots?
RAWRity:mine is about equestria forming an underground resistance against an alien race, but im not posting it...
Inb4 Scoot-Scootaloo wins by deficit of being the only contender.
well no..
if you like those hard types of games like I wanna be the guy, then maybe you'll like it
00,03:D
The end is very intriguing do you have a chapter 2
you HAVE to get the achive
1,3mod is bored, post ponies >.>
there is no deadline
I already played and beat IWBTH Dken, so Super Meat Boy sounds like a good challenge
RAWRity is it

sooooo it will go on forever until someone gets it~
.....I mean IWBTG *facehoof*
ok!
kirzstryfe: will do http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2675/

Twilightsparkle from the perspective of an outisider you had no reason to be guilty
Yes VioletVanilla? :3
Scoot-Scootaloo: exactly what in that game is scary?
my favortie game is gears of halo duty 2: revenge of the nazi zombies
New Vegas Scary?
00,03Traps, Giant Rad Scorpions...
The only thing that's scary is how overhyped it is.
Scoot-Scootaloo play amnesia on stream with a mic!
0,5Ello
00,03the Ghouls D:
Seriously, snoresville.
Heya LordCelestia.
Scoot-Scootaloo - that's why you *shoot* the scorpions
Scoot-Scootaloo YFW AMNESIA.

HAI
ALL PEOPLE

00,03Definitely Maybe!
wazaaaaaaaaaaa
Hello darknebula.
Vi played it...I almost crapped myself.
Amnesia?!?! *hides under covers*
06I did a live playthrough of Amnesia. . .
Scoot-Scootaloo you have to play in the dark with volume high
I missed Vi playing Amnesia? Seriously? Fudge.
It is mandatory
Oh god. Amnesia. Please No.
00,03Oh dear Celestia...
Bring forth the darkness and creepy mutants
also MFW StudyPretender is actually studying?
00,03guys, I have something to tell you...
Blasphemy.

Ha! Family guy!
00,03I get startled REALLY easily
You're afraid of the dark?
0,5Oh dear me

Oh that's going to be funny AS.
why do you think we want you to play this?
Dead Space? Where?
/me flies over to LordCelestia and nestles in his mane
hey rabitt

Scoot-Scootaloo: Then be very careful and DON'T look behind you.
man, Dead Space scared me .....well at the end of the game
wazzup nebula
right, ok, in all seriousness if new vegas is scary to you
lets not get you to play it live
im the ubermench
youll want some dignity
i have the second game
He'll never overcome his startledness if he doesn't take it headon.

Therefore, we throw him in at the deep end and MAKE him play Amnesia.

What about me?
00,03What about you?
I can't play Amnesia properly since I started playing Skyrim. I attempt to shout at everything.
What about phone?
I just had a tunafish sammich, what about you?
Meanwhile did you see the vid with the glitched enemy?
So cute...http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1578/
I wonder .... *looks up requirements for amnesia*
unfoundbug: I did not. Because I was playing Skyrim.
those things are scary even when they cant hurt you
Scoot-Scootaloo if you were to do a live playthrough of amnesia, would you do commentary as well?
1,3I'm listening to a song about giraffes

Unless you shout every other word. That'd be quite dramatic.
Meanwhile - dramatic doesn't have to mean suspensful

So i think i have created a brony tonight. I'm not sure about that though. I have shown him ep 1 and 2 of the 2nd season and eps 16 and 25 of the first season. Any other suggestions?
oh i should use derpy.me
Party of One or Lesson Zero.
Senior? Cool your the same level as I am
Show him some cool fan content
Gumri: Lesson Zero
Lesson zero... Hmm ok.
show him bubbles Gumri
hay SB
Bubbles what?
Lesson Zero scared me
Gumri did you hear any response from him/her about it?
Gumri: get him to read My Little Dashie

SuperBrony64 Pitch an cute idea for me to try and start drawing tomorrow. Must be canon pony.

oh don't I know it, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. I've been slooooooowwwwlly working on Ch 1 since OCTOBER
YES!
LC is LordCelestia, not LadyCanary.
For future referance.

I try to post in LC's secret room but it's just filled with Lurkers
can't it mean both?
I've been working on this pie... anyone know how to make one/
There are 2 LC's, but Im the birdy.

Any of you ponies want to see an epic Celestia/Trollestia cosplay?

:3
They have to accpet you as their child and with your decision...
:3
ScootaChicken 1 week no sleep. Gimme a call when you do it.
Why do you guys lurk in an empty room?
Personally I find the "keep your personal life to yourself" thing works out just fine.
Is it like a schrodinger's cat or something?
THEN I will listen to you when it comes to sleep :3
Is prince dari here?
Kind of.
PhrozenFire: daribot is here
most people don't know I live a second life.
Ima go bai
A point of no posts and floods of them at the same time?
I like to have this room open in the event that it manages to get going.

I want... The ... Cricket picture!!!
I auto-join this room when I start mIRC
and iiiiiiiiii will always looove yoooouuuuu
they poke fun at me
and just leave it open.
but its all in good fun
ever since I found ponies, I haven't had a single drop of alchohol.
Most people don't know I sneak out in the dead of night and hunt homeless people for sport. But hey, watcha' gonna do.
