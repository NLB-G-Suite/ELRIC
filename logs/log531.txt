In Japan, Evil = Stpuid as buck at the one moment you can't afford to be.
I don't think it would have been possible, Sumi. The alcohol would have splashed around in an arc following the lighter.

Damnit Little Kuriboh. Now I hear those fake lyrics when I listen to this theme
D: nooo

Sumica, I assume you don't like Yu Gi Oh? :D
Dont take it
Oh, this sounds familiar. So this is where Little Kuriboh got the theme for The Abridged Series
The moment he broke the rules, he lost. He would have been frozen in fear of when seeing the extra eye on Yuugi's forehead.

How does the card game work in this series?
SENTAMENTAL VALUE
oh look, it's prof. hawthorne
but they came to japan to geta the cards..
that face
Exodia is so last century
And then!
means hes clearly comming to steal it later
yep.
oh yeah theft is definitely in the cards
Starlight_Phoenix very broken in season 1, pretty much made up rules
time to watch two people play a card game
*sigh*
if the cards exixt IRL, is that dragon rare IRL then?
Dken2021, I SUMMON KURIBOH AND ACTIVATE MULTIPLY
HAX
I HAVE ULTIMATE DEFENSE NOW
Ohhhhh pwnd
STOP USING THAT WORD
Starlight_Phoenix: Well, rather like the real life ard game with three differences. One, you have only 4000 LP. Two, you wind up playing with holograms and evil dream spirits are real. and three, any main character can pull a card or useful rule out of his ass whenever it fits the plot.
No Field Magic Card does that! :|
D:
BEWD is so common now
Kencolt: Living Arrow?
3original yugioh didn't have much diversity
And then Ima steal it

SlurryMoon: Intresting
first saw & tried flan in Cozumel 2006 I think
how was it Cypresswolf?

I thought flan was more of a jello consistency, but actually more rubbery, can't remember the taste exactly
Tugi looked stoned for a sec ther.
scottish-geeky: forcing someone to work for money that's what slavory is
That flan looked more like pudding though
yugi*
flutterchu: ohhh i read it rong -_(\ gwad i rilly am a idot

flutterchu: u just minde fucked me

scottish-geeky: wow did i relly do that i never knew i had that much power
flutterchu: lolz
:) Not a very good resort though, buffet everynight, but the hotel staff were too quick to clear your table every time you got up - I'd have a plate full of food and a cup in hand, go to fill up the cup after setting my plate down to get a drink, come back and the plate would be gone - cleared by the wait staff :|
thanks
da fuck
surprised I didn't starve :P
So apparently Yuugi still hasn't learned his days of the week?
scottish-geeky: i think i mind fucked myself
flutterchu: how?
Or is it somehow magically that time of the year where there's no school? lol
/me Explodes
by reading that comment
Yugi's hormones went all to his hair o__o
ah a time when people use to wear watchs for more tha a fashtion statement.
por tristan or honda is in in the frend zone
I still use my watch. It's faster than having to pull out my phone to see what time it is (at least when I'm not in front of a computer...and even then I'll check out my watch first)
Damn, some one has a watch fetish.
:D that looks ridiculous
And I didn't watch Yu-Gi-Oh as a kid
RAINBOW
who needs that many watches
And I'm sure wearing them like that is severely dropping their value...lol
I have 3 watches...
00,10Screw the rules I have 9 watches
Digital wrist watch, FMA Pocket watch and phone
she talkins in a therd person
Why do a feal like smacking Honda with a mallet?

only "watch" I own is my cell phone - electricians cant wear anything on the job - not even ear rings in some cases
I've got an FMA pocket watch that broke on me (the winding mechanism broke) and my wristwatch (not digital :P)

i purposely went through the list and found the very bottom
Because my art was so bad
oh lol?

Ponies47 Keep practicing if you enjoyed doing it.

I guess I could :s
i disagree with the list anyway
although i do agree cowboy bebop is a great one
11,02i sleepy -.-
[BS]SuperBrony64 Don't go to bed.
As long as you don't act like a douchebag about your art no amount of bad art is enough to deslike you :)
huh so which Tumblrs are recommoended by you guys?
Also hi [BS]SuperBrony64!
Ohai [BS]SuperBrony64 I haven't slept in awhile :P
/me has kept themselves far away from pony art for a long time now
Also, take criticism when you can. I really hate it when an artist's fanbase attack someone who tries to provide criticism.
11,02I feel like sleeping ^_^;
FourFire: the only two I follow aren't proper for this chat :D
and they ranked it in the top 20 so yeah
ah, well there are PMs

MadSurge: in the game it can reflect bullets back
00,10bewarnd though Phase4, they have a stupid high burn rate
00,10whee's probably in the way
00,02i got it to work
Baka-Neku: Don't you think it's a little too early for NMN? :D
00,10So I see
/me is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.

Hai guize.
How are we?

00,10the shuttle deltas are good wings
XAX: :)
00,02Sumica, link?

One man. One gigabyte of broadband left. 2 days left of the month. One mission: to not cap himself.

Sumica will be telling Phase4 to go look at page 3

Oh, I found TWO amazing discoveries~
00,10they face oppsate each other
00,02whoops
There's something about the word "chrysalis" that weirds me out...
00,02that was chool
Phase4: that is so fucking cool :D
00,02cool'
Spell-of-Gaming: A "chrysalis" is a pupa of a butterfly.
Broadly, it's just an insect pupa.
^ i did not know that....the more you know!
00,02insta boomn
d3rb: Well, you know what they say.
Oh, and the other amazing discovery!
Knowing is half the battle.
g i joooooeeeeeee
Phase4, You'd be able to see that from HOBART!
Bronystate: Pioneering the Kerbal Fireworks Program
00,02^
Apparently, there's a horror movie called "The Changeling". It was released long ago before FiM.
The horror movie is from the Philippines, where I live.
I think you need to go Higher
00,10I realy should have tryed stuff like this with wheel of death
00,10try the realy fast jets again Phase4
if you got it to hold together it would be spinning so much you might say it was the drill that would pearce the heavens
00,02theres no more science here
00,02this is just bombing the space center
...but it's not that suprising if they adapted it from that... two of the animation studios for FiM are on the Philippines.
Isn't "drill that would peirce the heavens" from some sort of anime?
Gurren Lagan
00,10but yeah behing higher up works better with spinning
oh man how ILL must those guys feel
00,10less air drag

I'm still amazed Google Chrome would do something like that.
Spell-of-Gaming, they're run buy ultra-geeks. it's bound to happen
*by
Funny thing is, it has more views than the Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga Google Chrome Japan ad.
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, :3
and the award fro the prettiest contrail goes to....
Miku won a Cannes Lion award.
Oh, and at the end of that Miku Google Chrome ad, Miku winks.
I think you just won kerbal space program.

Phase4, if the horizontal jets point diagonally down. does it just explode?

WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING TO ME
00,02Vordox, Nice
Makes a few good point, right+
does anyone want those new tf2 items that released?
00,02that it does
00,02TheRareP0N3, i do, the scorch shot sounds fun
00,02and that scout one that makes you faster if you dont jump
00,02that'll be fun to see
00,02in other news, the nuclear dawn crash?
00,02it reached a breakpoint
00,02thats a thing thats put into code during development
00,02should not exist in production code
I understand why TF2 went F2P. The store probably produces more than enough money.
My ability to kill the chat continues to amaze me.
i guess its time to send out the tumbleweeds
00,02that should be fun
hi everyone
/me tosses tumnble weed into chat
00,02Kammerjunk, the store has produced many times the ammount that was made from selling tf2
00,02ohai Lil_B
ello Lil_B
what is this? is the Pyro Update out?
Lil_B soon
6 hours according ot the site
Well, the Pyro Update was out a long time ago, but Meet the Pyro will soon be out, apparently.
Chrysalis was there something special leading up to it?
oh great now im gonna have to do another tf2 update?
hate updating that thing every other day
/me hugs Lil_B
Just set it to update automatically.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOcFkjmYrxc <-- Have some d'awwww

WOW
A NEW OP WEAPON FOR PYRO, the most OP class in the game
COME ON VALVE
Nyarlko-san is funny. Fear the fork!
hi Vordox :)
Hai Lil_B
...Luna is playing TF2?
Meh. Pyro is pretty fun if you combine the Degreaser with the Axtinguisher or the Reserve Shooter.
lol
How do you get those things, Kammerjunk?
Found 'em.
I miss being on linux
Phase4: Twi got an ultimate?
00,02Vordox, twi got an ulitmate
Doing what0
You can actually play as ponies in TF2 now?
00,02EspyLacopa, custom game mode
Dat lag Phase4 :P
Punched to death by Twilight on Fire.
Good morning everypony :)
'morning
Huh. Slow chat.
apparently so
Needs more tumbleweeds.
I'm a tad sad that TF2 tends to be played while I'm stuck at work...
Same here.
What Ponyfortress erver are we on?
Petrified_Discord: My workday started 18 minutes ago...
Adorable Trash, eh?
User0: LOL. Mine starts in 12 :P
Petrified_Discord: nice, nice
Who is streaming?
Great. Sounds like someone on this voicechat isn't familiar with One Piece.
What voice chat?
On TF2
On the stream
Phase4: I see you are enjoying that spy...
00,02:<
SPY CHECK!
Good afternoon everypony
Good morning killerpony7733
Man, I was about to comment that Phase's buildings never get relentlessly attacked like mine do. Then, the Spy started attacking repeatedly.
Kandarihu: I normally roll with minisentries, so I don't care if mine die...
dead....
I don't even have my Gunslinger yet.
the gunslinger for engineer is very hard to use properly
Was it the gunslinger which I had 8 or 10 of?
The Gunslinger is what you use to build Minisentries, right?
(I filled up my inventory, so I just scrapped everything 3+)
Kandarihu: yeah
gOOD mORNING eVERYPONY
I just saw a rather not-so-decent spray near the exit to the BLU base.
It is a good end to an allpnighter.
Mornin' Jaketehsnake
Oh, never mind.
Mornin
It was a combination of sprays. And one of them is gone now. So it's all cool.
Joining, if it is the server like yesterday.

less then 6 hours to Meet the Pyro
08,01when i have babies, i'm going to sing them to sleep with that
For some reason, Lord knows why, that reminded me of Octopus' Garden.
I like Octopus' Garden. It's a nice song.
Wow, who did Phase4 became?
00,02twi
:3 Twi!
I'm trying to join the server Phase4 is on, i guess it will need 20min to download everything before i can play XD
00,02ikr
00,02i'm probably gona change server
00,02dont like these game modes
:3
Hooray!
I bet the amount of bullets fired per second spikes once the game ends
^
shoot all the guns at all the things - even if it is a wall just for the sake of shooting crits
Everyone's gonna go "TEXAS MOTHERFUCKER, YEEHAW"

MadSurge Do you like bugs?
MadSurge: uh just meet the pyro update? i believe it the video goes up just as the last update rolls out
MadSurge: and we will finally know who the pyro is
:O!
killerpony7733: really? pyro update? how did i miss that?
do anypony know when season 3 will air
diddutz: Totally haven't checked TF2 as of late have you? :D
yifle1: hopefully before Episode 3
MadSurge im okay with like butterflys and stuff but not fucking roaches
XD
diddutz: last update comes out in 5 hours which means release of the meet the pyro video
I am pretty sure
killerpony7733: had lots to do for exam the last few weeks
diddutz: understandable :)
killerpony7733: I hope we'll just get trolled and be told "nah seriously, we'll never tell you if the pyro is male or female" :D
all flying and shit
MadSurge: we probably will
/me bzzzzzzuuuurrrr
MadSurge: Knowing valve? very much possible
Why did i get banned from the server?
What did i do? Lol.
killerpony7733: I'd be happy if we just got stuff like "he's from X country" or "he comes from this military background" :D
very good game
MadSurge: you mean "hudda hudda ha, haaaa hudda hudda..."
MadSurge: or just ''person x somewhere in the childhood became a pyromaniac and voila''
well im off night everypony :$
User0: yep :D
Can somebody say why i got banned?
MasterBoss43: nope
killerpony7733 I didn't ask for someone who didn't know why i got banned,
prick.
Does anybone else think gilda should be in another episode?
Chrysalis: dawww sleeping gilda
killerpony7733: they'll probably have all other team members talk about the Pyro and say they know nothing about him and he'll do cool stuff :D
MasterBoss43: hey be nice i just said no from my part......
killerpony7733 I don't love and tolerate people like you.
MadSurge: maybe honestly i know valve are just going to make this a masterpiece
MadSurge PYRO IS CREDIT TO TEAM
killerpony7733: well Meet the Medic was already awesome
Baboon hearts!
MasterBoss43: ........I am not being a prick be a douche to someone who is showing respect, that can get you ban
:) lawl
banned*
MasterBoss43 It was probably an error or bug
ok after i informed myself about the update i think that might suck
diddutz: how so?
13what are ya using now then?
13ohai dere
killerpony i just said ''buck'' and nothing other that where crule to other players, but i couldent join again. So i am going to register in the forums and ask why i got banned and ask if i can get un-banned.
well there is a new gamemode :)
13Was allowed to come home early because it was so quiet today :'D I'd only been there for a couple of hours
MasterBoss43 How are you here if your banned then?
13but now

MasterBoss43 this is the server

Ponyfortress2 server, the one Phase4 in on. I got banned from the tf2 server >.<
MadSurge: i really hate playing against scout and the new scout weapons ... i think i will have a very hard time playing against scouts soon
._.
MasterBoss43 ohhh lol sorry
Xeeeeeeli
Hi
:3
diddutz: I wish I could play period, this netbook is too weak
MasterBoss43 Why don't you ask him?
13Xelispeon :P
13!espeon
THAT OTHER-SPEON.
Hi you too
I wish I could play, but I still have 9 hours of work...
Xeli
I played Skyrim today
did you have 1,1fun
xD
(before I go home and do more work...)
They changed the dark brotherhood joining system ):
/me sadfaces
I murdered 2 people for nothing
Lol yeah, it's a quest now
Also it's a lot easier to kill people in Skyrim than in Oblivion
it was so god damned hard to kill people in Oblivion ._.
i liked that as at times it was pretty ridiculous in oblivion
what was?
morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
especially considering elder scrolls "hard mode" simply equals "you do 50% damage they do 200% damage enjoy"
Oh yeah that
the health people had in oblivion was
MasterBoss43 Alrighty then!
kind of hilarious at times
yeah ._.
Sylandest: afternoon and i'm good woke up about a hour or so ago
Sylandest: chillin at work, pretty good
They have too much time to scream
i'm off for an hour or so, cu
/me hugs killerpony7733 and User0
User0 Your at work? :O
diddutz: laters!
but yeah a lot easier to kill now
get that assassin's blade perk + the assassin gloves and sneak attack everything
which is good
no more screams.
ever
XD
because 30x damage is fair
hahahahaha 30x?
User0 SO HARRRD COORE
:D
15x for the perk, doubles with the dark brotherhood gloves iirc
nice
it kills everything but outright bosses in one hit
brony wristband and RD on my desk
that's awesome
>tfw one-hit killing dragons
User0 Your boss knows?
XD
I don't know yet...
how does one poni poni
it actually makes sense as it is really assassin-like at least
yeah
User0 You must tell him
I'm thinking about drawing ponies on the whiteboard of my cube
00,02ders a game for a later stream
the first dragon you see is pretty cool
User0 Then you must convert him
the beginning of the game is interesting as usual
/me nuzzles Phase4.
>going to be executed
>dragon saves
HURR DURR
/me 00,02hugs User0 back
well
dragon appears
Phase4 Do you know why i got banned from the server?
also Xeli, which faction did you join? rebels or empire?
00,02stupid time zones
ohgodstarwars
DaemonLucius: Poni can poni poni with poni.
00,024 hours till pyro update
00,02its 12pm
00,02wait
HEY I SAW MY NAME! :)
00,02am
hahaha and well
00,0223:16 right now
i went with the rebels but the quest glitched on me and I went "okay I'll fix that when I'm done with all the other things"
hi Sylandest :)
Ah
coool
I'm unable to not go"Oh look a place on my map I haven't visited yet, LETS VISIT IT"
howdy, Lil_B! :) How are you today?
I think I'm going to go with the empire
lmfao
my name is color purple
the guy you see first
he's cool
so empire
what does MTP mean?
oooh, deus ex
but kinda awkward when you're listener of DB + part of the legion
lmfao
then again
Sylandest good, I was just playing TF2 on the same server, but i got kicked for beeing afk while i was cleaning the dishes for 5min XD
Phase4 you good with some L4D2 maybe after some DX:HR?
you were like, the hero/saviour of everything in oblivion and also the listener of the DB
00,02when we left jensen he was being punched in the face
So derp
00,02we return to jensen being punched in the face
00,02(i'm at the first boss)
Lil_B: awww...that wasn't very nice! Return the favor and blow them up later! :D
00,02killerpony7733, too late for l4d2
Phase4: good luck!
it's fun when you finish the quests for the db, all the guards go all "psst, I know who you are. pls don't kill me" when you pass them
00,02rounds would go beyond when i need sleep
Phase4: ah alright :)
or "i heard of your... recent exploits. i'll stay quiet kthx" and that sort of comments.
which is kind of odd as I thought that was kind of supposed to be secret.
Fun fact you can win this fact by using all the gas canisters and explosive barrels here
BUT ANYWAY.
/me stop, drop, flop.
ouch...dat face punch
Oh, my package was delivered to my local fedex at 3:40am~
Phase4: use all gas canisters and explosive barrels
XD
aaand random pony
^^^
Yeah that sounds hilarious
i like his mane :3
^^^^
User0: How long have you been waiting for it to arrive?
Kammerjunk: hiya
come on dont spoil how to win this
since Thursday
but <3 dualwielding
Howdy.
let him figure it out, thats half the fun
Dat fail jump
ololollolol
which system did you play Skyrim on?
you got ounched in da face
I had a 15% off which would have expired in less than 3 minutes of when I ordered.
00,02ok
00,02this is not working
ps3 because i overestimated the system requirements.
which works quite well despite a lot of people apparently having issues with it o3o
User0: Oh, that's neat then. I'm expecting to wait for a month total for a Twi' themed necklace I ordered.
Bloody oceans.
that did not go as planned...
00,02is there a way to cheat through these
00,02this is not going to be fun
Kammerjunk: took 3 months for some crystals to ship from china...
Phase4: easy way is explosive crates and gas canisters
Wow.
Phase4: throw the one gas at him then explosive
Kammerjunk i live in the ocean ._.
Kammerjunk Causing a commotion
I mean, seaponies obviously live in the sea, and narwhals live in the ocean.
Ah
Kammerjunk: sea and ocean are the same thing one is just deeper
DED
Skyrim on PC
13Someone was supposed to bring me money that they owe me on Monday, it's now Wednesday and this still hasn't happened
Requires Steam
-_-
Well, seaponies can't live in the ocean, that's just silly.
._. AE
Kammerjunk dem sea ponies
13I hate being blunt about things like this but I don't seem to have a choice >.>;
Oh yeah, good morning everypony! :)
oh hell
morning, RaveBrony
Phase4: Uhh theres actual canisters with gas there not grenades
00,02my grenade disapeared
I just realised why this program wasn't working
I forgot to get it to execute the function I coded
._.
RaveBrony Whats for breakfast?
I feel bad for phase all this getting facepunched
00,02was working for a bit
RaveBrony Whaaaaaa!?!
AE that sort of things you pretty much have to be blunt about.
hay
O.o
Otherwise it's quite easy for people to make use of it which is bad.
RaveBrony why not doughnuts? :[
Of course, a reminder isn't even -blunt- :P
/me facenuzzles Phase4.
/me 00,02hugs User0 back

13He's normally the kind of person who remembers simple things like this, he even said himself that he'd bring it over on Monday
RaveBrony come to my island

RaveBrony my people will teach you the ways

killerpony7733 we have made peace with the pony folk

killerpony7733 We now live together in the valley of peace and friendship
/me intense gaze into the distance
00,02this is tedious
+Phase4 You must defeat the white man for my people
That is quite often the way to go~
Phase4: when you stun him the first time get any type of gas canister and explosive thrown at him
Oh yay
Phase4: be glad that this isn't nethack or something - where you have to start all over if you die....
He did it! :O
+Phase4 i will reward you with doughnuts
Very good
Phase4: theres loot in this place too
13On a completely unrelated note, there's a dood who works at the cafe who has a bit of an accent (which I somehow didn't notice at first) and sounds a bit like you
13it's pretty awesome xD
/me gives +Phase4 doughnuts
Good job
/me intense gaze into the distance
inb4 DCD

That bossfight is so fucktarded :P
00,02i think i allso used a frag
Good solution you found, though
AgentKalim: honestly they are easy if you know your stuff but else it can be a pain
Lol

killerpony7733: He fell through the 4th wall and entered the Goonies
FairysHuff: :D
Ohai FairysHuff :D

MadSurge: Hallo
The light above me keeps flashing...
orly User0 ?
Social
00,02social it is
Phase4: honestly don't get it bosses can be beaten very easily either way
00,02probably should invest in the armour augs
00,02k
How's stuff FairysHuff?
00,10where is the pants augmentations?
Sumica: good question
Phase4: keep a eye on the alpha beta and omega thing
00,10every guy would ask for that including JC
woot
00,02ohai Sumica
i got mass effect 1 and 2
00,02PANTS!
/me pants Phase4
Bronysith: nice :)
Pants, yes. Pants are important
/me 00,02hugs Bronysith back
00,02i'm thinking about getting them
00,02when money of course
Should i be a soldier or biotic? Sumica what are your recomds? i remember enjoying soldier
Sumica: I'm fine with pants, don't need that :D
00,10Soldgier is good for outright run and gun
Bronysith: soldier is best if you really want all out firepower and biotic is tactical power use
00,10but just think MadSurge you could be a tripod
00,10boitics are OP as hell
◥▶◀◤ i dont want OP
00,10like unless you play on insane where every thing is armored and or shielded bitocs tear shit up.
hmm
ill play Biotic. i already played soldier before
00,10Infaltrater is fun.
Vanguard is best guard. Just sayin
Boobs
00,02this isnt working
Phase4: redo it
00,02yeah
Phase4: If he comes up Omega or Alpha you use the tactic thats opposite that.
00,10should have goten that pants augmentation
Phase4: keep a eye on the meters cause if you see what he is like alpha beta or omega you can use it to convince by pheromones
00,02i'm not sure what omega/alpha/beta are
My pants are augmented
00,10press spacbar to stank up the room
go for the romance option
00,02XD
Phase4: I would explain but I know I would make it overly complicated.
00,02TrixieBaconMuffin, that would be fun
Rad bromance augmentation
grrrr
i want mass effect to finish downloading
Bronymance? Where?
FairysHuff: right here
Not bronymance
/me kisses FairysHuff

bronymancer
Bronysith: *Kisses passionately*
/me hugs everypony :3

AgentKalim: Innuendo in encouraged.

00,02oh....

00,02Bronysith, nice shades btw
/me yawns loudly and walks toward the chat with bedhead and a pillow
Phase4: ty

Phase4: he is a alpha person try using alpha pheromones
or something
/me hands Phase4 ◥▶◀◤

Appease is for alpha
Bitch is for beta :P
http://static.zerochan.net/Pinkie.Pie.full.1036541.jpg
Oh. Seducing the boss man I see.
Oral is for Omega
Yeah pretty much
KISSS DAMN IT
FairysHuff: I don't know why, but something about that picture makes it so good.
Oh wow that actually worked
What's with all the bromance stuff?
Makes sense
Kammerjunk: It is rather good huh
Phase4: GJ you did it now do this mission, it will be a huge surprise where you get alot of backstory about jensen
AttackWithHugs its how Adam gets his pay raise.
FairysHuff: It is.
00,02yay~
Barbetos|Atwork: Oh...kay...
AttackWithHugs: *Attacks with the power of bronymance* You know you love it
00,02killerpony7733, before or after china?
Now take us to Hong Meiling
00,02i'm feeling that i should go to china first
Phase4: after china go to your computer ingame and read it and then see what it says
00,02k
I'm not 100% on this
Save first, maybe
FairysHuff: Lol I've never played this game plus I just woke up, even though I had the stream playing all night
Phase4: i mean't go to jensens office now check the email then see
I'm keeping my mouth shut. Never know when I'll stupidly throw out a spoiler for this game.
go to china , and learn those great sex moves john was singing about , then put the moves on your boss again
00,02ah...
Do that
:P
Do it filly
TrixieBaconMuffin I don't remember that being in this game...
Gona have to play through it again.
It totally is. :P
You should try it
I know what it says on Jensens computer. Though if you followed the story it's easy to figure out.
TrixieBaconMuffin: Oh my, what?
RAW RAW FIGHT THE POWER ◥▶◀◤
Row row
fight the powa
Bronysith: Why fight? Just love
...
Do the impossible see the invisible
row row
fight the powa
FIGHT THW POWA
i was referencing a john la joie song
And it went over our heads
=D
◥▶◀◤
Breasts
So wait, Jensawn is adopted or something?
Maybe
Jensen was created for the sole purpose of being in this game
AgentKalim: wait till phase does the side mission of this
hard to believe "show me your genitals" can go over anyones head ^^
00,02interesting
Seems legit
00,02ver interesting
AgentKalim: He's actually a cabbage patch doll from the 80s.
Phase4: wait till you get the mission for this it just blows your mind
Hue hue hue
Those cabbage patch dolls were creepy
I never noticed it before but this game has a Blade Runner type story going on.
I know :P
As does the original
Yyyyyyyep
Go the hell away, Poor Pritchard
People still play multiplayer for teh original Deus Ex through steam
Nobody likes you
:P
/me doesn't like Pritchard
Uh god damnit i need to remember if he has to go to china now then come back and then he gets the mission
God my memory is not working
Jump on all the tables
killerpony7733: Thats what wikis are for
Pritchard just got the short end of the stick AgentKalim. He just wants to be just like Adam. Augmentation envy and all.
00,10the numbers JC, what do they meen?
Oh my god JC a bomb
Sumica: Their take out menu numbers.
so Black ops produced a meme? of course
>men of wisdom and understanding
Sumica: best part of Black Ops was the Zork easter egg :D

noteworthy: deus ex human revolution
Deu sex
Invisible War is the best game in the series.
That's arguable
sweet ive never heard of it but it looks cool
Sup everypony?
first game is best game
Howdy, DarkStar
AgentKalim: It's not arguable, it's wrong.
Invisible War was terrible.
Phase4: you are safe with the backstory mission it first comes a bit later in the game
hey DarkStar
Morning, DarkStar

Hello DarkStar!
00,02yeah, but the other missions
Kammerjunk: I didn't want to be too confrontational about it, but you're right. :P
Wow. I am actually surprised I can not find an image with that dock worker guy from the first Deus Ex saying "I spilled my drink!"
Phase4: do them if you want :)
LOOOOL
Is that what I think it is
Holy shit RD :D
Congratulations Freddie Mercury, you're the new Rainbow Dash
RD would make a fine Freddy Mercury!
Pokemon anyone?
Eeenope
i loves Houndoom <3
Barbetos|Atwork: Yep loved that quote but overall JC has some of the most hilarious ones
Hyper sensitive tech
DaemonLucius: only Black edition
That's what she said
pokemon and call of duty are the same games all the time
killerpony7733 Now I want to play through it again. =P
Barbetos|Atwork: already done it over 7 times
That was weird the chat stoped going
It happens sometimes
Hmm

Maybe not. :P
having to have augments in your ass

MY BODY IS ALL LUBED UP FOR THE PYRO
Crono_brony: O-o
!pokemon
FairysHuff: yeah its for people who like simple upbeat stuff
CCCP: Saved
Gurren Lagann is ok, but the physics in the end battle annoyed me as they would have to be moving a lot faster then the speed of light to do.
CCCP Fluttershy would be able to get so many pokemans by just asking.
ikr
CCCP: I dont know why i typed CCCP. *FACEHOOF*
00,10and no one reacts to this?
Crono_brony: :|
EggWhite: lol physics in that show dont exist, in the end they throw galaxies at each other
/me sits on Sumica
Hm. there is some guy crawling around on the floor looking through desks in a police station. Not suspicious at all.
CCCP: you still ready for Meet the pyro?
Ikr Sumica

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yeah, apparently no one likes me playing those.
O hai
S'why I don't.
the stream is right on time
:/
Meanwhile because ?

Now we all sit patiently
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Probably because of the last guy who said "Dude, no one likes you here" to me.

ow ears
startled by bacon...
Dat bacon c:
My computer is off by a minute
Meanwhile: then play with us...we wont say that

Odd. This Meet the Pyro countdown is several second of on my page.
Meanwhile no idea when that was. just join when shizu make a server :p

I'm sitting here at work and I'm getting a lot of strange looks (I'm halfway hyperventilating)
well... props for including Ponies i guess?
that was not epic :)
You didnt like it!?!

PLAY IT AGAIN
Pyro, spreading love and joy around the battlefeild
Valve endorsing Drugs
It was perfect
/me nuzzels Pyro even more.
killerpony7733: Nope, shaddup.
THIS SUCKED
But not worth waiting a year for.
Seriously, when the Pyro cocked his head in the end there, I totally expected him to say "Are you my mummy?"
Meanwhile: Do not deny it!
whispering is scary
Scoot-Scootaloo can you give me a link
I liked it, I like ponies.
What's the link?!!!?!
YES!!

But that THING, We know its a THING
heavy is finally scared
I love them for not revealing the gender.
what is this? no country for old men parody?
Even the Pyro's own team fears it.
^
im waiting for the happy world...
owloysius: Oh Goddesses, cannot unsee.
WOW meet the pyro was WTF like xD
Meanwhile: Ah, Valve is taunting us..
The video has 307 views and more than 8000 likes already.
No gender at all

Pyro's always in his happy place^^
Shizuka: :D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUhOnX8qt3I
this needs no pony
he's a brony
a girl
Who cares.
somehow Valve managed to not answer ANY of the Questions!
Baby Spy is to smart to meet a Pyro face to face.
:o
spoiler
this needs no parody
I saw no baby Spy!
The Pyro is an "it".
He's OP, Valve endorses drugs. And not sure on what gender. :P
It's a...thing.
Why does it like babies so much?
it's a whatchamacallit
Who's that Pokemon?
hes a cat
she is a girl
Heys a boy
it is a unicorn
307 views....tomorrow 1 mil...

Scoot-Scootaloo: the pyro is a it
PYRO IS A BABY
Yes
You mean announcer?
Alchemist: yes
Pyro is Both! :[
Alchemist: eeyup
Vordox: But Pyro probably would have found him anyways
Om: because it still yearns for the childhood it never got
Scoot-Scootaloo: The 5 more minutes lady?
icybeauti: just 1 mil?

Kind of like how Pinkie Pie sees the world?

Conclusion: VALVe consists purely of trolls.

BUFFAH... LO!
Shamroc: I love slag gaming. But yeah you can set it to on kill - regen 100% of your ammo
Doom is clearly superior to all Cod games after World at War

DOOM= my childhood at the babysitter's
oh gosh is that a horrible port
Also inb4 someone jumps into a nuke and kills the whole team.

He had to go.
03Could you be any more obnoxious with your tags?
You wanna know the reason i was playing MW3 for 5 hours last night? The story on novice. I just want to know how the story worked out. after i beat it (on my friend's PS3) i'm done

Sumica: he stopped being mlg so he went to get mlg juice
03the whole album

FairysHuff: no. players
Dark_Horst: Fan boys
port??
Shizuka: I think the default is 25565 or something.
13oh yes i haven't changed that
FairysHuff: this divide sits too deep for mere fanboys
NOOO THE AD IS TELLING ME TO SHOOT 5 SCOTALOOS
13the reason you have to do the console connect is because it's a listen server
FairysHuff: nobody listens to them
Dark_Horst: Aaaaah
Shizuka: And what's that mean?
Shizuka: http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/3838767/Meet+the+Pyro/
13meaning it's running off the same client i'm playing on
A mistakeless life?
Question, how do I set up a seperate channel? This one seems to be flooded with game talk. I'd like to talk famous quotes.
Shizuka: I cant join?
Oic.

12good, I added a samsung 128GB ssd into all that stuff for 100 bucks to boost up faster

Watercooling is too much effort

03nah
GabeDry: Strange. This is a sociology topic that would be interesting to research.
03I use stock cooling :P
03on my CPU, I have the ChillTEC
12so you stock the coolers?
12not sure if they fit in my case actually
03...
03no
lol
stock coolers are fine
really
GabeDry: Problem is on HOW to research it..... It hurts my brain O_o
I mean, my PC's stock cooler keeps this thing at around 50C when I have youtube and tons of tabs open

hey Obsidian hows your day been
okay. the ghost was funny :D
Lil_B: Heh, that film was epic
flutter_spin: Don't you say... IT'S BADASS

I don't know. Brave was kind of disappointing. I can't say it for sure
Very_Silly_Filly I didn't like it XD
Aww, but I liked the OtT random violence D:
Candyland :P
yeahhhhh
2's gonna be cool, Chuck Norris and Arnie are in it
What's up people, I'm back.
Arnie gets a bigger role
I wonder how many references will be in this movie... I mean, we already see Q-Bert (older then 30years) to now
A robocop would be cool
uhhhh. I don't know what she is saying (because I'm eating) but it sounds...
Make ALL the oldschool vidya references.
Or monkey island
i think i've seen that gun before
Monkey island would ROCK
Lil_B perhaps it'll be the rodger rabitt of video games
lol
wut?
OH COME ON
uuuugh
was that supposed to be a g11?
its one of those animes
If they make a Monkey Island reference, I'm totally going to go bananas. :P
What's this? I've seen these characters before, but I don't know what the show is. :P
AgentKalim, Full Metal Panic
If they make a Monkey Island reference, I would offer to spend 500 quid on a commodore JUST to get Monkey Island
Ohhhhh
right
Very_Silly_Filly I hated the CGI in The expandables, they make awesome blood-effects without CGI since 50years... why use CGI that doesn't look nearly as good now?
that a-team reference music
Lil_B: Because they wanted it to be over the top silly
Lil_B: Because hurr durr, CGI for everything

He's got a shield!
Well, I do anyway
Freefall29: I guess I just like that sort of thing. :P
Protects me from 10000 hp of damage
Sumica yes, for more than 1 reason
he has turned blue!
Speaking of damage
I mean, it was a little short, maybe how awesome meet the medic was, meet the pyro was impossible to live up to
Guess what my bastard niece did to me earlier today
Fair enough.
I was sat down, and she dived on me
Torpedo 2!
the pyro is scary. He may not even be aware he is a monster.
She tried to climb up, and bloody kneed me where it hurts D:
pointy/angled hard armor is even better than curved in most cases
this should be a good fight

RAWRity: thought so sounded familiar, havent seen it in years :D
also they year is 1999999 so yeah you time traveld
The original is a lot more bland
Paranormal Activity?
Originally, there was a ghost Digimon called Bakemon that was beaten by them chanting a budhist prayer. The dubbers translated this as "Oh! Mind over matter! Everyone chant 'Bakemon Lose Your Powers!'"
Ha ha
oh wow
Residential evil
And Salem !!!

Anyone remember the "why don't you give him a shot" for the classes?
What the hell?!?!
It would say her for blue pyro
wow
good thing it happening "before" he started his dump
why is this happening
Seems legit
G-g-g-g-ghosts?!?!?! :O
your butts will explode
apparently Animax did a dub of this show that's "true" to the original script. What is even the fucking point.
so crap your pants
Yay for the pyro being a dude. I cant beleive nopony pucked up on this the first time around
wow
did the chat derp?
:O
not the toilet
strange toilets indeed
RAWRity: this is much funnier anyway :D
the hell
so...What anime is this?
SHAD UP!
i think its called sit, squat, or stand
Winter_Shadowhooves: Ghost Stories
wats up with the toilet designs, forgot to ask last time this was shown
RAWRity thanks
Get ou!
he always says that
00,10that's how they look in Japan
weird
japan's toilets a really lazy.
page whatever is best page
Was the originally supposed to be funny?
talking cat?
Basically they dig a hole and tell you to deal with it.
have I taken what the pyro has taken?
MASF123: nope. dead serious.
OMG. lol.
nooo not her
00,10mind you it's more of a old thing.

Okay, I can't stand it anymore
is that ask ketchum?
*ash
my god thetoilts are such a big damn deal
I can't take this acting seriously.
00,10yeah cause that is such a better dub
The japan actually just look down on people who have to poop, so they make their toilets as shameful to use as possible
thats a song
dont you be afraid when things go bump in the night
*japanese
