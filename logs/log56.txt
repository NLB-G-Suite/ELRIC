Kezarim, you ain't seen random shipping in chat
inb4 projectile vomiting
nah, you can't ship people until I get shipped.
I was suggesting we should take the poll at Intermission time or post-Movie Night, though
Best A movies are those which could be categorized as B movies too.
Brody makes a final stand. He tosses one of Hooper's scuba tank into the shark’s mouth and climbs onto the ship's mast. He fires his rifle directly at the tank, blowing the shark to smithereens. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody swim safely back to shore.
Shes chum, dude.
HAND!
But ah wanna quote too >:
It's not random shipping. It's DESTINY
Discovery still does Shark Week.
So music only plays when something Sharky is happening?

Elky: What mustn't I know of?! Tell me!
Elky: it IS saturday :P
6The Rifftrax just is a good idea.

/me just inject caffeine

the pace of this chat makes me feel like the movie is slow
yes we are.
Everytime I see that I'm going to Hell
Pool's closed do to sharks
Door opens
I believe this is appropriate to this discussion
ok

just checking
We sure are, anon
old man is annoying
but Elky, saturday is when the fic happens, Friday is when everyone hits on me and makes me feel pretty. I mean...
ReticentSmolder, you know what speed does right?
kezarim, but this isn't saturday show
hm, true dat keza
why are there drums- oh
Applebloom, cover your ears too
Maybe it will work in IE tab. I hope I'm wrong.

You guys with your fast talking.
SILVERMANE WHY CAN'T I RESIST YOUUUU
Anyone want to go swimming?
you're all horrible
6We do need a good name for it though, but that's not a big deal.
This is Jaws rite?
I believe I've missed out on this rifftrax idea
Oh Silvermane you are just HOT
Yes
Actually...yeah
Yeah, I'd love to do Rifftrax
we are abnormally low
DERP

I agree
silvermane is irresistible in pony form

MASTUR CHEEF
then again, people are waiting on the lottery tomorrow
Rifftrax = BOAST BUSTIN'?
Hardly anyone is combining ponies with this.
kinkeee
Well shit, I didnt know about the anti-spam protection
7neither do I..
But the point is that this is an A film, and using Rifftrax would take the air out of the "A" part of the film
MY NIPPLES EXPLODE WITH DELIGHT
Boyscouts? I'll be there

Heya, all!
Indeed
thank you
Hold your wee.
PEE YOURSELF
we need a ponychan thread about how SilverMane brings all the Bronies to his yard and, damn right, its better than yours
lol
makes sense
lol
JAWS is about a city that somehow gets its economy solely out of tourism and not through any other factors, such as trade, import, or local businesses, which we can blame on the shark rather than the government's seemingly large incompetence to take notice of their people. WHAT A STORY.
hi luridchronomancer
hi lurid
Beached Closed due to G1 Ponies
8and we dont have to worry about the stream cutting out and people missing announcements
Well, IE tab works even less. Doesn't even show the chat. I CAN NOT MAKE THIS CONNECT. I NEED TO KNOW WHY BEFORE IT STARTS.
It means shoo-be-doo
The jellyfish killed all the sea ponies.
*Beach
not since spring derpybot? XD
*shrug* it just seemed to me that frankly, viewers liked the idea.
Friendship is Magic style hippocamp-seaponies would make this movie so much better.
wait they're taking a car out to sea?
well...that's good...I guess.

Hello Luric
I don't think polling for something like this is a great idea. we should save polls for things like feature night content imho
Well of course not. Why would I allow my Royal Pet out in public with a saddle?
Seeing as it probably IS considered kinky...or something.
What about me?!
*Lurid

JAWS: A dramatic story about an unbelievably simple problem to fix that ends up getting muddled by fat politicians. Clearly a criticism of modern-day government.

fucccccc adddddd
I nearly typed shit. That would be bad. Killed by poo.
4Well, that's depending on whether or not the film has a rifftrax

8THATS WHAT SHE SAID
I watched jaws when i was 8 or 9/ no biggy
keep rollin
6No.
4Oh, it's Sunday
haha
6We and some guests.
the shark is a chain
Bigger fish requires bigger fishing hook
4That means we're picking the film?
JAWS: I swear, it isn't what it looks like.
Agreed wolfcat22
God my mother is annoying
Yeah...you're going to need a bigger boat
/me hides in the auction house

He can just about read
/me wipes Stormwind out quarter by quarter.

And teach them fear of sharks at the youngest age possible
this is the perfect ruse to catch a shark
8not during an actual broadcast
they need a bigger pier
6Why would we do it mid week?
piece of cake
I believe your vessel is of questionable size.

Acquire RPG. Fire at shark. Costs $2,000-$3,000 illegally, and protects against fraud. The end.

Jaws: I eat humans because seals are too mainstream.
I tried that once and I was all like
You dead.
PIZZACAKE
WHOA CAN'T HANDLE IT
swimming to shore seems like a good idea
I think Jaws has leverage over them.
No fish is that strong 0_o
Pfft, these foals don't have the powere of a NEW ENGLAND ACCENT! on their side, so they're obviously doomed.
Exactly.
I guess they really did need a bigger pier
WHOS THA BAIT NOW BITCHES?
mfw i still have no idea about this rifftrax business..
And the pier turns to.
SPOILER: The music spoils everything
Org is where it's at.
The dock's attacking!

Billy mays?
0DesSur watcha you sayin boy

Ghosties: I can do that

Shoo-be-doo, shoo shoo-be-doo
hot nuts?
the stream has a five-second-delay with what the streamer is...well, streaming
I AM THE MARE WHO ARRANGES THE BLOCKS

This horror movie is nothing. I am still willing to swim in the ocean after this. A good horror story makes you not want to eat cupcakes every again.
Nuts.
6RainBro, that's why it's on Sunday, after the regular streams.
did someone say flying shark? http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/1381/sharkc.gif

4In that case, let's do a test mid week
I want to go out with SilverMane's bag of nuts
blox
lol nuts
Going out with nuts...
'You're going to love my nuts'
...
Billy Mays here with Jaws Repellant! The fast, easy way to keep yourself from being devoured in an instant!
6DCD, that's why we'd use synchtube.
the music ruins any surprise
jaws: MMMMMM buffe!
nuts
Aquire explosive.put explosive inside a large
cow
There is no 4chan in the 70's. So, this is not funny.
what's the background voices from?
Someone seriously needs to ponify that
and also, how will we watch the stream while listening to ourselves talking down the stream talking about the things we're watching on the stream when we're watching them in the future?
GENTLEMEN
throw cow into water for shark to eat
i don't go into oceans, fish fuck in there
in after you mentioned synchtube...
MENTLEGEN
GENTLEMEN
*ahem* gentlemen.
Gentlemen?
Lol
DSNessmith: Dat gif
WTF IS THAT GIF
Best line ever
Dye?
too many people in the boat
Walk straight ahead
Mentlegen...
Nope.
why don't they just kill the shark with a flamethrower?
*Note: Jaws Repellent does not protect against Tiger Sharks, Shark Sharks, King Sharks, Killer Whales, Pirahnas, poison, drowning...
"Heh, they're all gonna die. :D)

Natural Selection, Natural selection, everywhere.
We're gonna need a bigger leverage

Cutie mark crusader shark hunters!!!!!!!
they'd just need some barrels and it'd be a piece of cake
K
4I just had some confusion when one mod is saying the stream, and someone else is saying the movie
I am pretty sure the HISTORY CHANNEL would make a REALITY SHOW about these REDNECKS! History Channel isn't about History anymore, no, it is about REDNECKS!
Sharks hand fishing

Whats a "Merr-durr"?
Ghosties, most Steam groups program several events very close to each other...I'd say to ask the steam group what they'd prefer, but yeah, I'm of the idea that we should perhaps program one for each night
is shark guy gonna die?
mm, pretzels.
but my TV is broken
...due to the lack of brown people
@axel "the gulf" of mexico- not that great
I was also going to ask you something man

The scars were terrifying, but they hinted at so much more
I remember when a shark bit my dick off.
Unreal Tournament is super fast-paced where you kill anything that moves, and Tf2 is more team oriented. I'm going to suck, lol.
Brody likes to watch
He looked at his 3rd leg
Such pain in this man's past
8nicotine patches are expensive as fuck
6I don't have any money. Can't afford patches.
WHY ARE THEY ALL GETTING NAKED

Jaws insults people for no reason.
SPOILERS: Shark = The Rake
Sharks drown if they stop moving.
Drown the shark with air
NewDCD, emulating dem old versions is the best way ta do it
oh ok
He kills for the lulz.
yes, sharks can drown. they need to be in perpetual motion to filter the water through their gills.
0Smoke
A shark has to move to breath, so technically. Yes, you can drown a shark.
NewDCD: Why throw more money for a game you already played?
0Overheating

D_man would probably be right
maybe i meant inafter
/me wonders how Silvermane can gag when he's top
Jaws accidentally the boat
