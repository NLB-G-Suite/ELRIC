Canada: havn't seen u in a while!
CCCP: did you finish those errands?
dat OmegaMetroidBrony
btw guys, wasn't Canada Banned before?
CCCP: yeah
03I'm like, these bugs are obviously flying around... dunno if they're just stupid or what, but it's like they wanted to "challenge accepted" and see if any of them didn't get crushed by my windshield wipers
/me is too socially backwards to throw parties
mario_pony: ummm not even close
nice try omega.
Yes. I was perma-banned.
you can't get out of this.
But now, I'm NOT! :)
mario_pony
Canada: you appealed? Or is this a Proxy?
wrek likes accesories :3
party tiem nao.
ANSWER THE QUESTION
mario_pony: but i did add to the picture!
if you are perma-banned, why are you here? that defeats the "perma" part.
Ok here's a good question. WHAT IS THE BEST MOMENT OF SEASON 1 OF MLP FIM?
/me is hella not good at the socialising
02wouldn't they just fly off when you went to drive away? |D
Neither. I'm really f:Oking confused.
MahBoi777

Canada: how did you get banned?
Canada: GET OUT BEFORE THEY SEE YOU

Ponies47: There's too many I can't decide
CCCP: so what you gonna call it?

best moment of season 1? "LOVE ME!" :'(
its like there not being "one" in highlander, IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE!
CCCP: he did shit that was warranting a permaban.

CCCP: Yeah, Canada got permanently banned, but then was appealed, and now, banned again today. Canada used to be USSR, in the old days of when I first joined here.
CCCP: you're stupid

03> Unless they make some significant changes from the consumer preview, at least
03<usotsuki> yeah, like removing everything that makes it 8 and not 7
You've never seen a major case where a ban was the only option did you?
they are quite interesting
I have.
02yeah, it is geared toward tablets
05i often reach up to 200-400 for a finished image
02that's true
CCCP: I got banned for 1 hour today :(
Agree. Sometimes is only option
05but sicne the program can only handle 256 layers i end up merging finished ones
Gunthler: Almost, I'll be finsihed with it in around an hour.
Wrek: Layers?
Dermathil: i dont belive the one that just happend was one of those

117 is the number of Halo
CCCP: I disagree, if someone is being a dick, and they've been warned and kicked prior, a ban is warrented, and should be enforced.

OmegaMetroidBrony: Incorrect. Otherwise luminotherapy would not work on people. Light HAS an impact on your mood.
Spitfire is turning out quite well.
She is.
02that's a windows phone in case someone doesn't know how they look
For the best trolls, you hardly know if they're trolling or not. Takes skill. Most trolls just go straight into moronville.
Spitfire looks yummy :D
Can't argue with science

As usual, WREK IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Scoot-Scootaloo: k, cuz pony r34 makes me feel tired too
DeathStar: well Perma bans are STUUUUUPIIIID!
CCCP: who said perfection? you have self control. Again, if you've been moved up the ladder of punishment, like a 3-strike system, and you keep screwing up, then you get what you get, and you dont get upset.
Dermathil: I don't know tbh

Ponies47: just do it. It won't kill you.
twilight_sprinkler: shaddup, that joke is old
Hugs DeathStar back
08,01i love to see you beam!
Dermathil: Nope.avi
11,01That's enough reason for me to hate them.
otakon: never heard of that movie
Come on every pony smile smile smile
08,01the corners of your mouth turned up, is always pinkie's dream!
Nittany_Discord: INCORRECT. BLIZZARD NOW HOLDS THAT TITLE. ERROR 37
Fill my heart up with sunshine sunshine
08,01otakon: i stopped doing it; too busy
08,01otakon: maybe on thursday
/me feeds off of otakon's rage
11,01Ubisoft still likes it.
all I'm going to say is on disc DLC is garbage, and thats my 2 cents.
My cauldron is preheated and I have you.... wait, wrong sing.
Dermathil: eeyup, nothing like a game people have been pining for for 4 years and they can't play it half the time
08,01Gunthler: http://test.du.cx/smilething.mp3
Ubisoft doesn't PREVENT you from playing your single player if the SERVERS ARE FULL
11,01Modern mainstream games suck anyway.
Ubisoft is not that harsh.
cant we just say that all publishers are evil and shit, and get on with something else more interesting?
THose who still say that and praise Diablo 3 are hypocrites.
/me wubs assasins creed
11,01Not all of them are bad.
Yeah. I guess I still have 2 hours I can go back to my fic
Nittany_Discord: I was gonna say...
08,01Gunthler: i was messing around with my field recorder
whatever... im not getting into this...
I just wish I didn't spend the entire day out. I only had time to watch Season 4 reboot and then I had to leave again
YES PUTLOCKER GAME OF THRONES IS UP. BYE ALL!!!!!
So, dat B/W 2.
/me dances on Midnight_Tempest s head
11,01It's just the big ones that get away with large amounts of consumer abuse.
Maybe I should see the new episode of Legend of Korra online
And the smaller ones tend to be idiots
Nittany_Discord: none gets away under my watchful eye.
Case in point: THQ
*sighs*...
flutter_spin: splendid idea
/me punches SunderlandPony89
will there b more streaming?
11,01THQ. EA. Sony. Activision.
HOW DARE YOU INSULT THQ
Everytime I have to leave it's either sleep of being called upon as the seapony who lifts heavy things
THQ IS GOOD GUYS
11,01Ubisoft.
11,01THQ uses on-disc DLC.
THQ IS GOING BANKRUPT BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING GOOD STUFF.
11,01And online passes.
HAHAHAA
11,01They are NOT good.
PICS
dat rage
DeathStar: wat? :d
00,03On an unrelated note:
OmegaMetroidBrony: only u have da powah
Hello.
Om: is that person still awake, or AFK/stuff?
Dermathil: They spent millions on some drawing tablet that NO ONE wanted and didn't bother to even try to advertise it. Idiots
I have tons of THQ games and I have not seen on-disc DLC

IM BACK! WOOT!
the big companies do it cause they dont give a shit and they believe consumers to be idiots and keep buying their shit, and you know what... THEY FUCKING ARE...
WallDives: You decide
welcome back panda
/me is such a Nintendo fanboy that he is ignorant of what all the other publishers are doing.
11,01Midnight_Tempest: Yep.
meh. rather not have to guess.
Scoot-Scootaloo: :'(
Scoot-Scootaloo: I don't get it 6_9
That strummed a few heartstrings
Dermathil: I must admit that chick is attractive however
SunderlandPony89: That was a bad commercial move, I admit. Doesn't change that THEY HOLD THE DARKSIDERS FRANCHISE AND THE WARHAMMER 40K LISENCE
Scoot-Scootaloo: dat reference :D
/me liks Scoot-Scootaloo's link
02wb
00,03That's the horsehead nebula!

WallDives: I don't feel like finding out, what he does is his own buisness.
RAAAAAWR
2hai
Scoot-Scootaloo: well... we know who celestias mom is now :D
THQ is still a shit company... doesnt matter if they make Warhammer 40k...
11,01Dermathil: Look up Saints Row 3.
/me loves Astronomy
08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: that's no nebula! that's my mother!
SPACE MARINES!
Om: I see.
11,01It has an online pass and on-disc DLC.
Saints Row 3 is not a good game.
Scoot-Scootaloo: it loves you too
Saints Row 3? Not enough replaty value IMO
11,01I lost my case else I would take a pic.
00,03lol :D
thanks
Dermathil: AND the Metro license. And, from the info I've seen of the Metro: Last Light, they are tearing at an otherwise amazing franchise
your the best t space
WallDives: Nice to hear a ping for me ever once in a while tho xD
02how goes?
/me shrugs.
*at
Nittany_Discord: Then are there any gaming companies that you approve of? 6_9
11,01Smaller ones.
actually... Relic makes the Warhammer 40k games, like Dawn of War... THQ just publishes it...
SunderlandPony89: I know. I LOVED METRO.
i really like Omletes
doing alright, tired mostly
capcom and konami.....
yourself?
:D
teh_Tharassan: Cashcom used on disc DLC.
I like toast
6_9
Hey FlareChaser!
11,01Capcom is bad with on-disk DLC.
Omnomnom on dem Omletes
and bacon
:(
Biglaw: stallker.
/me gives DaringDude an omlete
why... am i talking about this crap? its just making me angry... i done with this convo... lurk mode, go...
true
11,01And some always-on DRM for console games.
DaringDude: I c wat u did thar
Midnight_Tempest: don't lurk mad man!
/me noms on da Omlete :3
Om ^-^
I have to pay 20$ for new characters in SFxT.
THQ did some bad decisions, but they are part of the GOOD GUYS in the publishers melting pot.
Omlet?! where?!
/me hands Midnight_Tempest a muffin......that is also on fire.
Dermathil: And they are shoving unwanted multiplayer into a game that didn't need it in order to try to pick up some CoD morons, and doing God knows what else to make the game appeal to the "mainstream" audience. Ugh.
never mind its buggy as hell.
What game are you talking about SunderlandPony89?
/me spins in a cirlce then sits down
MUFFIN?! ... ...
Dermathil: ME3 ofc
/me burns otakon's house down with the combustable muffin...
Dermathil: ...Metro: Last Light. How havce you not heard?
aww harsh bro
otakon: THQ DIDN'T PUBLISH ME3
YOU BAKA
Midnight_Tempest: it was just ON FIRE DAMMIT! IT wasn't combustible!
I like Spyro.
:P
SunderlandPony89: Oh? SO ITS COMING OUT AT ALL?
Dermathil: um, you don't think he wasn't talking about ME3?
11,01EA published ME3.
11,01They ate Bioware alive.
otakon: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT METRO LAST LIGHT
Nittany_Discord: and you hate EA
11,01I knew EA would eat Bioware alive.
Dermathil: CALM YOUR TITS FRENCHIE
he y guys hwos everyone doigng tongt?
Hi FlareChaser
Spyro is a cool character.
Its late, im gonna head out everypony. Good night and take it easy!! Chat with you all later! :)
later RaveBrony.
SunderlandPony89: last I heard the game had been Cancelled. So I'm okay with multiplayer if it makes the game come out AT ALL.
Night RaveBrony
night night
cya RaveBrony
11,01EA is so "corporate."
FlareChaser: Dermathil is raging, and Nittany_Discord is feeding me his hate of big name video game publishers. It's spicy.
Dermathil: Last I heard yeah. I'm sure at E3 there's gonna be new info on the game. I'm as equality scared as I am excited
gnight RaveBrony! sleep well!
night RaveBrony sleep well
sup flare chaser! i has no idea who you is :P
It's been fun but um.... night Bronystate don't let the changelings bite....
Night RaveBrony and hello FlareChaser
/me 11,01dusts otakon
ironic that EA stands for electronic "arts"
night RaveBrony :D
otakon: l owlut man, am not part of thi now;
Is anything happnin'?
Nittany_Discord: At least Valve has survived untouched
SunderlandPony89: I had heard it had suffered the same fate as Stalker 2.
I remember when EA used shapes as a logo.
/me never cried really as a child
So you understand how happy I am.
11,01E3: Sequels and motion controls.
Eeew motion control
this talk of EA and all that shit... its just making me more depressed... gaming will never be the same cause of shit like that...
Nittany_Discord: i somep ony ragivng?
WallDives: I remember when EA was ELECTRONIC ARTISTS and actually CARED about the games they published.
why wont teh sho load?:S
RainbowBlits: no stream atm is all
11,01Back when EA made games?
otakon: I know right
Midnight_Tempest: don't be depressed!
otakon: tbh, i kinda dont, since my contribution is to their NHL and soon FIFA series.
otakon: Reminds me of an EA centerd episode of Extra Credits
Feels like dancing
SunderlandPony89: eeyup
11,01Caring about gamers is good when you actually make them.
Dances
"EA, its in the game"
I'm happy about that. I had read stuff that was saying that due to THQ's financial problem they had cancelled Metro Last Light.
oh right *derp*
11,01Instead of doing nothing but selling them.
/me gives DeathStar a dancing Derpy
6_9
because as much as I love PES, FIFA is better, and NHL2K is a joke.
02I'm doing pretty good
02Suddenly I’m feeling restless
Gunthler: srsly where do you get all these?
Nittany_Discord: and trying to nickel and dime their customer base for everything they could.
Dermathil: I can't imagine why they would considering how well Metro 2033 did
and remember when Square put out good games?
EA is Jenny and the Wimp.
DeathStar: My back pocket :D
The only game I like to play today from EA is SSX and some Battlefield
WallDives: yeah, good times man, good times.
instead of cookie-cutter RPGS? Inafune was right.
do you have a bad connection?
00,03FIFA <3
WallDives: No. Because JRPGs suck. Trololo...
Gunthler: like a cartoon charictor?
Scoot-Scootaloo: :| FIFA, really?
11,01THW is going bankrupt, and they deserve it for using online passes and on-disc DLC.
fifa?
and this is coming from a Phantasy Star child, I didnt play a FF until I was in Middle School.
WallDives: Lost Oddyssey was technically cookie cutter but dammit it was GOOD cookie cutter.
11,01*THQ
2Yeah, Spyro is pretty awesome
DeathStar: Eeyup. :D
SunderlandPony89: it didn't do as well as other titles. Still, it did better than HOMEFRONT
WallDives: but 13, and 13-2 are just......egh.
I don't have a bad Internet connection.
Lost Odyssey was okay.
Any brony here have a youtube account im looking for some brony's i can friend
FF6 and FFT are my favorite FFs.
RainbowBlits: I do
X is best ff
Cause none of mah other friends aprove :p
sweet!
when Aeris/th died, people cried, I laughed at them, cause Alis did the same shit years earlier.
RainbowBilts: I have two. One to watch vidoes and one to post
teh_Tharassan: it's good, but 6 and 9 are my favorites
otakon: 9 was kinda boring to me sadly...
Dermathil: That's not saying much actually :P. And Metro 2033 deserved to do much better than Homefront. Deserves to do better than... hell, a lot of games actually
still have my SNES copy of 3/6 and instruction manual.
Nittany_Discord: So they deserve to go bankrupt for ONE infraction? You're INSANE. THQ didn't use on-disc DLC for Darksiders, Metro 2033, ANY of the Dawn of War (1 and 2) or Space Marine. So CALM DOWN.
teh_Tharassan: eh, I liked it.
WallDives: nice
teh_Tharassan: 9's appeal was from its references to prior FFs.
11,01They still use online passes for MP titles.
um
if you had started at 7 like almost everyone had, you'd have been rightfully lost.
My youtube account is XGruNtpwnEr117X go ahead and friend meh :p
03ugh, I swear something on my Facebook is broken
11,01And how do you know they didn't use on-disk DLC for those titles?
03it keeps showing that I have an unread message even though it doesn't show which one is unread
0,5Don't advertise your stuff here please
03I read all my messages
last I heard, Space Marine and all of the Dawn of War (1 and 2) DON'T.
03(both present and past tense)
Space Marine is a crap game...
11,01>Uses online passes, >Deserves to go bankrupt. >No sympathy for online pass-using publishers.
ok, I'm kinda mad now.
i need to rant for a quick second.
Pissed_Tempest: That it was. Forced multiplayer was the main reason for its downfall
You mad WallDives?
Nittany: I know, I got preorder on space marine and had to download the necessary files. as an extra update.
Ingwaz: shoot.
02odd
This convo is interesting :D
/me puts a muffler onto Ingwaz
Ponies47: not about anything here.
WallDives I've just finished watching Over The Limit......
11,01EA is circling the drain for similar shit.
Hi Everypony!
You know, the update that is pretty DAMN BIG
I'm back
Dark92Enigma: herro :D
Dark92Enigma: No Ace crusher. I'm VERY pisssed.
11,01Plus the nickel and diming they do.
also, only listing games from the Warhammer 40k universe doesnt make a publisher good...
02I really wouldn't know what would do that
and Nittany_Discord, ONE MISTEP IS NOT ENOUGH.
i find it baffling that my youngest sister has elected to be a vegetarian. she does not even like most vegetables. she does not eat a proper amount of food each day, or get the proper nutrients. she counts calories to the extreme. AND SHE WANTS TO STUDY DIETARY NUTRITION
11,01They've used online passes for years.
worst*
GIVE ME PROOF DAMNIT
11,01Since shortly after EA started.
WallDives IKR? He didn't do anything! He let Big Show do all the work!!!!!!
03probably getting two messages at once
Ingwaz: has your sister taken steps to prove that this is what she wants to do?
BUCK! I gotta go! I have to go to bed! But I don't wanna. Anypony wanna sing me a lullaby?
03or like, while I'm already reading a message
Ingwaz: heh siblings lol
03another comes in
03and since I see it instantly it's not marked as read
03or something
Dark92Enigma: how about that Savage shout out during Punk/Danielson?
Ponies47: alright NIGHT NIGHT
Ingwaz: How old is your sister, man? She sounds quite young
03but I wish it would tell me what message so I could just hit "mark as read">_>
A sizeable chunk of my gaming library is filled with THQ titles, NEVER had to use an online pass.
/me gives Ponies47 a Fluttershy
NEVER.
/me sings Ponies47 a lullaby
episode 11 of season 2 finished!
/me sings gets Fluttershy to sing Hush Now Quiet Now to Ponies47
03...
WallDives: shes kind of in the wind about it. thats another thing i found absolutely baffling...she lacks the drive or ambition to do anything herself. she wants to be babied pretty much as much as possible
03dafuq
WallDives I couldn't help but shout OOOOOOOH YEAH!!! DIG IT?
11,01Dermathil: http://derpy.me/XKUCL
03I click "search for unread messages"
SunderlandPony89: i believe shes 19
03says no results
Dermathil: SR3?
THQ is a SHIT COMPANY... even if they go bankrupt, Warhammer 40k games will be made... so WHO HONESTLY GIVES A FUCK!
02FailBook
Ingwaz: you are talking about your sister no?
Nittany_Discord: anything that's not Homefront?
MahBoi777: the saddest part is, i'd consider her the smarter of my two younger sisters...the other one...good lord i could go on about her for ages
Ingwaz: then this is possibly a phase, and the best that can be done is to show that this may not be whats best for her. after that, I dont know.
panda: yes
Because you know how much Homefront matters in anything right?
/me doesn't care about the arguing
Thats what I've done with my sisters, though, and most of the time, it works.
Ingwaz: Then she comes off as pretty immature
/me hugs Pissed_Tempest calm down silly filly
WallDives btw in less than 2 hours, (sigh) it'll be one year since Macho Man passed away (looks at the time) 1 hour left.....
DeathStar: O_O
Ingwaz: that bad?
Ingwaz: well... ive learned thats what sisters do. she doesnt use the "im a female so I can get what I want" thing does she? cuz thats what my sister does
Since someone spoke about Blazblue before, forgot who... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DzSL7mbcoI&feature=BFa&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ !
Pissed_Tempest: the problem is, WHO would publish them after that? I've heard talks that if THQ falls, They go straight in EA's ARMS.
Pissed_Tempest: why u pissed? :(
Is sung to bye Sunderlandpony89, panda, and Fluttershy.
WallDives: another thing that baffles me about her, i've tried that. i've told her its not healthy, she does not listen. she literally just shuts it out, ignores it and acts like she knows whats best even though she has no research to back it up
Would you prefer seeing EA getting their hands on Warhammer40K?
OK BYE!
I don't.
Ingwaz: then she has to shoot her own foot.
I definitively DONT
bye Ponies47!
02try refreshing cookies?
Dermathil: That's a scary thought acctually. New metro titles in the hands of EA would most certanily be destroyed
Falls asleep
bye Ponies47
Vordox: hehe i know pretty much all of those :D

SunderlandPony89: That's why we need THQ. They are one of the better alternatives.
Ohai SB64
panda: Then face me.. I find almost NO people here in Sweden who can beat me in Blazblue. :( Hate winning easy tournaments
/me dances on SuperBrony64|AFK s head "that dosent look afk"
Could anybody tell me when Avatar, legend of Korra is streamed normally ?
Ingwaz: then I have nothing else, I dont know.
panda: she does get away with that, my father is soft
Dermathil: anyone would be willing to pick up the license... THQ doesnt even make the games, Relic does... a Canadian company... so you trying to defend a publisher that makes money by putting their name on the box is just dumb...
Dark92Enigma: ikr?
WallDives that's why i sighed
:( I dont have it on my ps3
SuperBrony64: I thought of you mooing when I saw some cows today :D
02dunno. Cookies can do weird stuff like that
WallDives: normally i don't want to punch people...but extreme ignorance just angers me...
Dermathil: The less of two evils I guess :\
Ingwaz: oh wow... i bet he is hard on you though huh?
Hmm bronycon, whos going?

Pissed_Tempest: I know Relic does the fking games. What I say is that EA IS WORSE THAN THQ.
WallDives I cried when i found out he passed away...we all did......
03I'll try in IE,w here I don't keep cookies
11,01Keep going Dermathil?
Vordox: not sure if you seen it but I dont have it on my ps3 :( i always play at a friends house
Ingwaz: it does to, and its why I'm out of contact with most of my family.
panda: eh, hes not a complete hardflank, but he does expect more from me than he does of her. thats just the way he was raised
panda: Oh XD
teh_Tharassan: If I had the large amount of money it would require to go, I would. But alas, I'm poor
/me pokes SuperBrony64
Also Nittany, I'm surprised. It seems EVERY SINGLE GAME that I have from THQ doesn't have any of those things they are accused of.
Dermathil: EA set the standard for being crap... everyone else is trying to reach that level... deal with it
Meaning They mustn't have pushing them.
Ingwaz: hm... protect the girls and man-up the boys?
Thanks MahBoi777 :D. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for it
03interesting
03it *does* work there
03and shows no messages
03hm
02yep
no prob:)
02thought it was cookies
If I'm not mistaken
03well I can delete any cookies involving facebook
panda: pretty much. when i was a young teen, i mowed the lawn in the very hot summer heat for years, neither of my two sisters ever did it for a full summer
03I don't want to clear all of mine as LOL having to login to sites
Vordox: sowwy :(
panda: he always ended up doing it for them half the time
Pissed_Tempest: Incorrect. Not everybody is. They need to lower their standards to make their ends meet because EA is money grabbing so much. Otherwise you wouldn't even have GoG.
THQ published a G3 My Little Pony game. Am I right?
panda: No worries. =3 Only found 3 people who can beat me, barely here in Sweden. Perhaps go to Jap and try rookie. :D
11,01Until THQ stops using online passes (and on-disc DLC), I will wish them a swift death because trash publishers like them need to go.
Ingwaz: I know that feeling. My sister doesn't do ANY chores; I gotta do them all. At least I get paid for mowing the lawn :D
Ingwaz: sorry, but I hate fathers like that... they just give into the stereo types
03fixed
/me pokes DeathStar
11,01Major publishers period need to go. They ruined gaming.
02nice
Besides, THQ didn't push online passes on the Warhammer title games. So either they are VERY specific on what titles they want them on (SURPRISINGLY) Or the developpers are pushing for them too.
/me dances on Gunthler s finger
SunderlandPony89: well, shes been cleaning on her own a bit, so i don't begrudge her the chore part. i was just showing what it was like growing up
WallDives I remember he was also in a Dexter's ''Dial M for Monkey'' episode.....RASSLOR. that one when he voiced an intergalactic wrestler bent to take on all comers
11,01Except for Space Marines, modern Warhammer titles have been PC exclusive.
Dark92Enigma: I vaguely remember that.
MahBoi777: btw, late response, yes the other sister is that bad, completely mind boggling bad
11,01Don't need an online pass for PC games.
Ingwaz: Ha. I wish my sister cleaned up after herself. The amount of times I've had to clean her messes are to damn high. She's 19 years old too
Space Marines didn't need an online pass.
hey you!!
Hey everypony!
11,01No used games marked to milk.
hi DerpStar!
'Ello DerpStar
hi DerpStar.
11,01Hi DerpStar
Oh, so because you play games on console, EVERYONE should suffer?
Ohai DerpStar
I have a good sister...
you know what... im not arguing this shit anymore... im fucking tired of it, THQ is shit... EA is shit, Ubisoft is shit... they are all SHIT... a few good games per company, doesnt make them a good company... im fucking done...
How considerate of you Nittany.
Hey You!
GilDash:
Ingwaz: lol, dats okay, I got a younger brother and sister, the sister is trying to lose weight, and the brother is just flat-out evil.
Vordox: oh, did you ever play guilty gear?
11,01Dermathil: I guess you love bad business. EA-like publishers like that. People that will defend bad business practices.
I don't mind if Console games need online passes. That's what happens when you use hardware that's preventing the industry to use the cutting-edge technology to its fullest potential.
panda: Used to do, JAM FTW
Oh most brothers are evil MahBoi777
hey DerpStar!
Vordox: jam was my main and Zappa was back up ^^
11,01And people like that are why major game publishers abuse the hell out of consumers.
MahBoi777: she hot?
02also
11,01Because everyone takes it and defends the practices.
11,01So people will half a brain suffer.
panda: Bah zappa, everyone knows that Jam was the one and only. ;D
Nittany_Discord, EA and Activision can go to hell. Ubisoft is borderline. THQ is trying to do good.
MahBoi777: losing weight is the youngest sisters reason for watching her calories so much. she fails to understand that because she watches them to such an extreme, shes basically starving herself and her body will hold on to everything she gives it. she wont even eat vegetarian corn dogs because they have 150 per dog rather than 120-140 calories per vegetarian chicken patty
Is my net slow or is there no stream ATM?
mario_pony: Lolwut:D
/me runs
DerpStar: no stream.
ikd :P
Besides, I love how you lump every publisher in the same bag.
oops
02totally*
*idk
Dermathil: no stream
MahBoi777: i also understand the brother part...my older brother was a jerk when we were kids...
:(
Vordox: yeah, but it was hard getting off her super specials mid fight, especially if someone was one you, but zappa could pull of his spirit release thing when ever :D
fortunately he did grow out of it a bit, hopefully yours will too
The problem is, do you choose to buy a game that you really want to, if the terms of the publishing is abusive?
Next you'll say Valve needs to go bankrupt because Steam is also partly-DRM.
03nah
panda: Well Jam wa sa hit and runner. ;)

It's stupid o'clock over here. :D
GilDash: hi, bye, and sorry.
WallDives: Sorry for what? :D
11,01Online passes are for milking. Nothing else. It's punishing people for buying used because they don't have the money to buy new like publishers want.
Vordox: hehe :) I used to use Sol as well ^^
GilDash: aww byes :(
GilDash: if you dont remember, thats for the better. night.
panda: Sol was an arse. ._.
WallDives: Why, did you do something to Om? :D
11,01It's not to pay servers or to not steal from poor devs.
Nittany_Discord: you do know that used sales are also VERY bad for the developper, right?
No.
11,01Too bad.
WallDives: Well, whatever.
Because they recieve exactly 0% of the cut?
03God dang it Sonic 4.2
Night guys. :)
11,02Publishers: "Used = Piracy"
03stop sucking so much
GilDash: Why would you assume that...
03these bonus staegs
Vordox: haha i know which is why I used him in tournments, I knew his astral heat death touch :D
03*stages
03are obnoxious as frick'
11,01Doesn't make cutting parting of the game out right.
Dermathil: Woah woah woah, you're gonna defend publishers when it comes to used games?
Night GilDash
02that they are
Om: considering him/her, its actually a logical jump.
Night none-the-less GilDash
11,01If they want more new game sales, stop making the new product undesireable.
/me glomps GilDash ill see you tomorrow? ;)
panda: Yeah, you will. ;)
11,01Like, no DRM or microtransactions.
WallDives: Still...I don't like it.
11,01Or always-on DRM.
woot!
SunderlandPony89: in certain cases, yes. When it is because the Developper needs the money that comes from their cut from new sales, yes.
WallDives here's the link, i might get banned again for this: http://www.cartoonlair.com/dexters-laboratory/1x02-dexter-dodgeball-dial-m-for-monkey-rasslor-dexters-assistant-video_6b69f709a.html PS Skip to 7-11 minutes for the Monkey episode
/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head
Om: then you should say that and quit being passive.
Om: Oh quiet, I was being nice. :)
11,01Or on-disc DLC.
11,01Or something buggy.
Now, really. Night! :D
well, i do feel a bit better after ranting a bit. so thanks to those who listened
:D
11,01Make the game cheaper or worth the $60
03http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/481360_10150957027715605_42214640604_12296059_786426052_n.jpg
11,01And make the paid copy worse than the pirated version.
Nittany_Discord, you are going way too hardcore. That's like saying "WE NEED TO KILL ALL HUMANS BECAUSE WE ARE POLLUTING THE PLANET." Things can CHANGE, no need to murder everyone involved.
WallDives: Right. I'll keep that in mind.
You know what those publishers should do? Just make their games use decentralized online multiplayer and distribute patches over bit torrent. Bandwidth problems solved.
huh? worse than the pirated version?
WallDives: if you can't Skip it....then you´ll have to wait until the end of the dodgeball episode.
Nittany_Discord: well... the gaming industry is shit :( which is why I pirate then buy XD
11,01*better
Dermathil: In that case I'll agree. For games like Lolipop Chainsaw that really need the sales, I'll defend the need for new copies of games like that to be sold. Should of pointed that out when you first brought up used game sales though
03hm, do I want to leave trollish comments for people who use instagram?
11,01Legit copies are already worse then pirated copies mostly.
Dark92Enigma: I know what cartoon it is, I cant see it right now though, I have other things running.
11,01Because of on-disc DLC and/or online passes.
6like everyone else who comments about instagram
6cuz you wont be the first
11,01Or bad DRM.
03there are actually no comments on the picture in question
03:P
^
03and it was uploaded like, yesterday
03so
03that only really happens if you're popular
WallDives Oh, OK then:)
Nittany_Discord: yeah :( or I just borrow from a friend
03given that they're *my* friends, what do you think
/me hides
has anyone played 9 hours 9 Persons 9 Doors?
lookup 'spyro: age of the dragon' or something like that, theres an artical about it and its drm, they got realy clever
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4&feature=artistob&playnext=1&list=TLVHuu3iOQaJc o3o
WallDives: yes I GOT ALL ENDINGS WITH NO HELP :D
Hello, I am new here & nobody has welcomed me into the Herd :(
Dan: welcome to the herd!!!! whats up :D
mario_pony, o u :P
mario_pony: No
Welcome to the herd, Dan
panda: you too? anyway, you playing the sequal?
/me hugs Dan
welcome Dan!
dan:welcome to the herd
11,01Dermathil: as far as gaming publishers and that industry goes, it's only going to get worse with the current people involved.
hi Dan
:)
WallDives: its out already????
Nittany_Discord, the DEV TEAM is partially responsible for the content. The Publisher gives the funding and in exchange gets a part of the sales and limited oversight of the project to make sure their money is invested well. When a game is shit, the developpers are partly to blame. The Publishers are not the only ones at fault.
:) <3 thank you everypony
11,01Because most are short-sighted and greedy.
Dan: A new brony? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsddzah7p9w&list=FLMiKyfpd2YMs-0bb-hnzcFA&index=5&feature=plpp_video Welcome to the herd!
HUZZAH
hey Dan http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4&feature=artistob&playnext=1&list=TLVHuu3iOQaJc
WallDives: id there a patched english version
yes I am a new brony
Question: Nittany, do you believe Bethesda should also go bankrupt because of their business practices?
/me dances the welcome dance on Dan s head "WELCOME BRONY!"
Dan: welcome to the herd
panda: not yet, but there will be a legit one soon, and i'm sure there will be a english playthrough of it soon, if it isnt out already.
mario_pony: That was mean :P
11,01Bethseda doesn't have bad business practices.
11,01No online passes.
SunderlandPony89: That's mah horse!
11,01No on-disc DLC.
WallDives: i will check around and see if anyone patched it already, should I link you?
http://www.youtube.com/user/XGruNtpwnEr117X?feature=mhee
thank you kindly, I hope you all treat me well
/me hits SunderlandPony89 with a chair
/me slaps MahBoi777 "That's MY horse!"
Brink and Rage?
Dan: as a new brony I believe you will find that we are generally very welcoming here. so if you see a conversation that interests you at all, please jump in, we wont think anything bad about it
MahBoi777: lolwut
panda: not really, I'm willing to wait.
MahBoi777: NO THATS MY HORSE!
03hm
Are you saying there was nothing bad involved with Brink and RAGE?
11,01Rage is id.
WallDives: aww okies :D
/me whacks MahBoi777
03Pokémon 2000 gets blocked worldwide by ShoPro, but the first movie doesn't
ID is the developper.
03I think the third will be fine too given that my AMV didn't get blocked
okay, Ingwaz ^^
Wikipedia lists Bethesda as the publisher for RAGE.
Dermathil: Brink just sucked though, and Rage was OK
Ingwaz: NO WAIT, IT'S MAH HORSE!
11,01I think iD put the online pass in.
/me made a YT channel from the German server and is going to upload as many full Pokémon movies in HD as possible
these live streams are every week?
/me smacks Ingwaz
Dan: there's streams most of the day, just not now.
11,01Brink didn't have an online pass that I'm aware of.
OH, SO NOW THE DEVELOPPER IS TO BLAME WHEN IT COMES TO BETHESDA.
00,03Dan: These livestreams are everyday!
MahBoi777: no, its my horse!
/me punches MahBoi777
t
:D
oh ok cool :D
honestly... still talking about this shit? really?
/me wacks Ingwaz's with the SS otakon
Dan: everyday meaning whenever a mod feels like streaming
what time are they usually on?
You are saying it yourself. There are times when the Developper is the one who puts the DRM and stuff like that on. Isn't always the Publisher.
oh so there's no particular schedule
EVERYONE IS TO BLAME.
^
Dan: generally there is somebody streaming something. its pretty rare that we actually stream ponies, thats usually saved for the weekends
Dan: not really.
00,03Dan: 24 hours a day!
11,01You have a point.
/me blames everyone
Dan: exept on brony movie nights every friday
congrat Dermathil... everyone is to blame, can we finally drop this shit? please?
00,03And as much as I would love to engage in this SRS, I must go eat bread
11,01But I know as far as THQ is concerned, they are the behind their online passes.
just got here from sweeties mansion its a pretty good fic:)
it's all mah fault?
00,03I mean go to bed~
Scoot-Scootaloo: just bread?
But the Developpers are not rich enough to fund the game development cycle without help.
Scoot-Scootaloo: woooo, bread, the food of gods!..and college students
/me 11,01hugs Scoot-Scootaloo
oh. night then, Scoot-Scootaloo.
00,03Night y'all!
Scoot-Scootaloo: is drunk
bye Scoot-Scootaloo
night Scoot-Scootaloo
11,01That's why Kickstarter games are getting popular.
time to take advantage of him
night Scoot-Scootaloo
gnight Scoot-Scootaloo!
bai Scoot-Scootaloo
Scoot-Scootaloo: Thinking one thing and tpying another? :P Night anyway!
Night
bye scoots
I love you guys already
11,01Because gamers and devs are getting tired of publishers.
WHOO!
THQ's business practices may not be picture-perfect, but it doesn't change the fact that they are still doing better stuff than EA and Activision.
lol, if you're a brony, you'll probably fit right in Dan
/me thinks Freedom Fighters 2 is in desperate need of a kickstarter
Any one else wathing epic pie time at this moment?
Dan: you'll love eet here lol
11,01Sorry, but I'll never defend a publisher that uses online passes.
Hey, everypony! Been a while!
11,01Never.
i meant watching
btw everypony, do we still stream the re-aired pony eps every saturday?
I'm a new brony
hello everypony <3
Hai Rainbow

Dan: protip no.1 if you tipe in part of someones nic and hit tab it auto compleats it and pings them when you sand it

Rainbow: rainbooooooow

Dan: it makes thing a hell of a lot easyer huh
/me 11,01hugs emangamer
Ingwaz: we are now discussing about Kickstarter
Rainbow: Hey, me too!
Rainbow: No stream atm
haha yes it does DeathStar
TheRainbowDash: DUN DUN DUUUUUN
11,01What percentage of game ideas get turned down by publishers ?
Dermathil: i didnt know welovefine was involved in a kickstarter at all
so... is this convo finally done or do i have to plan on cracking some fucking skulls... cause i would love to use my baton on someone
120%!
Nirr
Nittany_Discord: 80?
Derp
Bluh.
ummmm 3 and a half%?
Bleh.
Pissed_Tempest: i vote you crack MahBoi777's skull because THATS MY HORSE!
Rainbow: Yeah, I am working on my story now, only a few more minutes until I am finished!:)
Pissed_Tempest: no need for that just burst into flames
Ingwaz: that's because they got a few millions from it and are making a new point-and-click adventure.
Nittany_Discord: 100% of the original ones?
Nittany_Discord: we talk about this too much, can we not do this again please?
TheRainbowDash: You're making a story?!
Ingwaz: Wait no! it's your horse it's your horse! lol
11,01Activision won't give serious funding or attention to any game that doesn't have "Call of Duty" in the title.
Dermathil: wait wait wait, welovefine, the clothes selling website right?
i dont want to burst into flames... i just want this shit to stop...
Nittany_Discord: LOL
MahBoi777: ah ah ah MahBoi777, thats not how it goes
Nittany_Discord: Battleship the game begs to differ.
is stream finished?
O_O
Rainbow: Yeah, I arleady completed one, this is actually mt second one that I am working on.
Pissed_Tempest: calm down deep breaths
11,01Battleship didn't get serious funding or attention.
Harry Potter and the adventures of call fo dty
(my)
Ingwaz: OH DERP. I mistook Welovefine and Doublefine. HERP DERP.
Nittany_Discord: doesnt deserve it
Pissed_Tempest: try ignoreing it and hopeing it goes away
Stream has undergone a serious case of DEATH.
dat RainBroDash
Nittany_Discord what about the Tony Hawk series?
Star wars the odl republic: call of duty
Dermathil: i was wondering what you were talking about
I AM ALL CAPSING FOR NO APPARENT REASON *derp*
11,01Tony Hawk is dead (minus the remake).

RainbowBlits: you didnt all caps the end, for shame

/me flees

World of warcraft: call of paladin duty
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: nothing just dance~
lol
Dermathil: oh how i wish i could throw money at games like fighting is magic and legends of equestria
Also, Diablo 3.
11,01I don't have them, but you don't have the numbers for failed kickstarters.
Dan: are you aware of the main pony related sites that most bronies use?
call of diablo 3 duty
Nittany, I was asking you to find them.
winter wrap up winter wrap up!
no I'm not Ingwaz
Besides, Activision funded Diablo 3, didn't they?
11,01I can't easily fetch the number of games turned down by publishers.
(It isn't a CoD)
dont judge me
Dan: i'll pm you then and inform you
I only know this place
11,01Or failed kickstarter projects.
/me dances around the argument and sings all the songs from the lion king sound track
03I know right
03well
and ponychan
03ShoPro can go die in a fire already
Dermathil: It's nearly as large as a CoD game though
WOO Songz
i wish they would remake evil genius, i loved that game
03(Japanese name for VIZ, who owns the copyrights to Pokémon)
SunderlandPony89: doesn't matter. Nittany said ONLY Cod gets funding.
i sense alot of h8 in this arugement
03I might disupte the claim for lulz, since they really can't do anything to me
Dan: try equestria daily it has all the pony news
eeyup
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I dont. I see this as a strong debate

11,01SERIOUS
WHY SO SERIOUS???
Nittany_Discord: I think I saw numbers of failed kickstarters being around the 75-80%
Nittany_Discord: y u so serious?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: no no let the hat flow though you
hate*
And Nittany_Discord: are you saying Diablo 3 didn't recieve any SERIOUS funding?
join teh dark side
There's rarely any emotional games anymore
11,01That's Blizzard.
Dan: derp
lol DeathStar u need to go back to year 1
BLIZZARD IS OWNED BY ACTIVISION
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: We have cookies
Ingwaz is showing me all the main websites, thanks :)
11,01They're merged.
Spell-of-Gaming: there are, just not in english most of the time, and in the VN/Dating sim genres.
They are in the same spot that Bioware is regarding EA
11,01Not woned.
11,01*owned
does the dark side have cookies?
SunderlandPony89: so ur on the darkside
SAME THING
alfye: YES
THEY RECIEVE FUNDING NONETHELESS
alfye: and free parking
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Yes. These cookies are irresistable!
11,01Activision didn't lend a cent to Blizzard for Diablo 3.
alfye: yes
They spent it nonetheless
SunderlandPony89: im already on the darkside
11,01And they're name isn't on the box.
WallDives: Japan is crazy, but secretly emotional.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Kewl. Dark side is best side :P
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: for real I am
lol SunderlandPony89
03you might find this funny
DeathStar: dont be so harsh on ur self
Spell-of-Gaming: not even secretly. just expressive in a different way.

03(to YouTube)
LUNCH
03but then I installed Chrome and it worked
WallDives: You have a good point.
11,01I don't know if Activision will leech off of Blizzard when CoD finally dies.
hello?
MahBoi777: At night :D
ヽ( >∀<)ﾉ AHAHA AHAHA AHAHAHAHA
Oh it will
Ohai
They already are
<3
DeathStar: sure <_< >_>
SunderlandPony89: Lol, how strange
They were already leaching off of CoD while they were leaching off of Guitar Hero. They showed they can leach off of two games at once.
11,01If Activision helped Blizzard with Diablo 3, fine.
/me slaps Alicorn_Prince_Shane " I am you doofis!"
i have lunch every second<3
11,01They ran Guitar Hero into the ground.
11,01Forced yearly releases.
TO THE GROUND
DeathStar: ill finish this convo after ive had lunch
11,01Actually, more than that.
11,01Band Hero.
YUP
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ok
Nittany_Discord: I pray that CoD will share the same fate
11,01It will.
/me sighs
DJ Hero.
this conversation wont end soon will it?
emangamer: probably not.
They aren't doing that with CoD because they saw that doing it too much causes it to die
11,01I want to end it.
Nittany_Discord: then can we?
11,01They are.
then...end it?
11,01Yes.
emangamer: Give it 42 more minutes
so, how bout them ponies

One interesting fact is that Applejack is the G1 pony of the same name, the only difference is a hat...
INB4 Dan vs. pre-g4 ponies

I should have more time in the fall, more free time to actually catch up on some gaming by then
Lol good

Maid_Luna_of_War: No, I live the middle of nowhere. I live in a rural farming town with a pop of 1300
Dan: that is sea ponies
:(
im gonna play some portal 2... see if that calms me down... doubt it though... ffs...
oh there's applejack!
If the Avatar Universe advanced to cars and cities in 7o years since the war, what'll happen in another 70 years?
I USE TO WONDER WHAT'S FOR DINNER
Aww *hugs
SunderlandPony89: 1300, wow, that's a lot!
*hugs*
:3
I still make time to find the cool stuff though :)
Ponies47: ME TOO:O
Maid_Luna_of_War: it'll be modern day probably
Yay!
Maid_Luna_of_War: What's the pop of the town that you live in then?
Maid_Luna_of_War: it was likely a period of technological renaissance
otakon: or... THE FUTURE!
no
MahBoi777: :O
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Rr3gb_l4Q&feature=g-u-u YAPLAP IN THIS DAY ARIA!!!

oh god Vordox

Maid_Luna_of_War: You live on a farm then or somethin?
Eeyup
R.I.P. Headphone users

otakon: He can't...XD
I wish I had that superpower
Vordox: YES! YES! YES!

Vordox: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_VheAwZBuQ&list=PL61FB9F68B20BB8D4&index=12&feature=plpp_video
how does his neighbors put up with him during recrding?
I picked up this view master handheld game
Yaplap has a voicebox of steel
fire is my favorite bending
MahBoi777: Not for long XD
BUCK YEAH YAPLAP! :[
what's that?
sitting is my favorite type of bending
Ohs
Do you remember those things that had this wheel where it had small pictures on it
Dan - I like how Iroh was all "Lightning is serious business. Only great masters can use it." and now friggen EVERYPONY can lightning bend
Vordox: lol, it will be so sad once he loses his voice
ikr Maid_Luna_of_War
and you would stick it into this thing that you would look in to view it?
same with metal bending!
its called a view master
infinite Energy
http://www.redbubble.com/people/lcpsycho/works/7806620-this-aint-a-shirt Then what is it?
Mhm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvNLjOuYSFQ&feature=channel&list=UL <-- The classic one that STARTED IT ALL XD
Well, Lynn is Toph's daughter
well the difference with this thing I found is that it has an lcd screen inside it
there are other metal benders though
ooooh
Amon is just an evil badass
Welp, that gave me a headache. AND I HAVE NO REGRETS
SunderlandPony89: XD Check the one I just posted.
Lol
:p
It's half past twelve in the afternoon here.
http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Tandy/3D.htm
Even if Lynn Beifong is an older lady, she is oddly hot...
thats what it looks like
BUCK YEAH I WUB YAPLAP! :[
not going there. . .
"AT THE GALA AT THE GAAAALAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIH!"
Vordox: I didn't even know he did the opening! :D
03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/funny-graphs-the-only-reasonable-explanation.jpg
03:D
actually, I don't think that's lightning bending, but just being able to course lightning through their bodies. That's why Iroh couldn't teach Zuko how to make lightning, but he knew that firebenders can always just learn how to manipulate lightning thrown at them
didnt tandy make the armatron?
YAPLAP BETTER DO THE FU*KING DAY ARIA! :[
maybe that explains it
The gala song he did is...OH MY fricking god. XD
Ponies47 he has
*THIS
Ponies47: he did
umm I dont know
Dan Mako and the others at the power factory where bending it
WHAT!
14lol
14I disagree
/me runs
14ALSO
Righto, I gotta get some sleep
yeah but were they creating their own lightning or just manipulating it?
14!weather cologno monzese italy
WHEN?
Conditions for Cologno Monzese, Italy at 6:20 AM CEST May 21, 2012: Light Rain Temp: 52 F/11.1 C Humidity: 100% Barometer: 29.65 Wind: ESE at 13 mph
Yaplap is making me :D very hard
14yay for rain, nay for humidity
the Equalists have Big Daddies, there's no hope
Ponies47: Want a better ideea..Activate the SOUND Caption XD
MahBoi777: :(
hmz, i think so.
if they were making lightning, then you're right. I would have to see that episode again
Ponies47 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Rr3gb_l4Q&feature=g-u-u
Does this all relates to Rainbow Dash?
Righto, I gotta get some sleep
Night Bronystate! ^.^

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES! :[
Hello Shamroc how are you doing tonight!?
derp :p
Dan, what use would they have at a power factory if they were'nt generating lightning for electricty?
FlareChaser: doing fine
woah
Wire works just as well as a body
-sigh- It's kind of sad no one's steaming.
I saw that exact same thing like...4 months ago
:O
noway, where!?!?
Hey FlareChaser did you read chapter 15 yet?
CURSE YOUTUBE THEY DON'T TELL ME (Squee)
:[
one of the stores I check out for stuff
not really sad, it just it.
is it rare?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C85WiRoTvQQ&feature=channel&list=UL LAWL his interview how he became a brony XD
just is^
Do you remember how much it was?
well, rare-ish i suppose
alright, I'mma go everyone
Maid_Luna_of_War: yes, that's right
umm
bye <3
Biglaw: Oh no I have not! I will now!
probably less than 10 bucks
hello everypony
i've been having a difficult time trying to find one tht works
Alrighty FlareChaser
:O they sell for 50+
Hello pony_7774!
It was missing everything from what I remember
hello pony_7774
the toys and such?
it was just the base and the crane
I wonder if it would be illegal to lightning bend in that one bending sport
http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg
hello
interesting
Pro bending
the batteries were left in it
it had a ton of leakage
hi jesus
lol at that picture. xD
hmm
hi jesus
how you guys doing?
good
Sumerpan is greatest hero
thats interesting though
well next time you see a cheap one you can prob make a profit off of it
didnt think it really had any value
yeppers
I like Iron Pan
i just made a rainbow dash plushie
doing great jesus, and u?
Wow. All the mods are asleep.
I don't really do the buying and selling stuff though
i've seen some go for 80
13am not
Or Smider Pan
I use to a while back
Yay! My story is now visible on the site!
but nowadays I just buy to keep
oh it's called pro bending? I gotta pay attention lol
TheRainbowDash congratulations!
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/25881/Fluttershy-Starring-In%3A-Shy-of-My-Own-Kind
yeah, i was getting it for my bf.
You're obviously sleep-typing Shizu.
There it is, if you are interested to rea it.
Hai Shizuka .
(read)
you were? why?
nice
Shizuka.....you never did answer the question i asked you in game...
13which
Dan: My theory is that Aang's non-bending middle son is Amon
Viri, by definition, if humidity goes over 100%, it has to rain.
/me eats a pound of sugar
he had one as a kid & wanted to get one and display it
ohh
14o.o
Shizuka: the one if you think im an annoying asshole or a fun guy..
14really?
pinkie pie eats twenty pounds of sugar a minute
13oh, you are a good person~
that sounds like what I probably wouldive done
WOO!
?
Maid_Luna_of_War: wow that's a pretty bold claim. Hm, but it actually makes sense
yep. wish it wldve worked out.
14I remember reaching the 90% sometimes, with a sun that was as hot as the hell xD
well if I ever find one ill let you know
he later told me that he cld have easily replace the wire...*after* i sent it back of course
well, that's what you perceive
Alright guys I need to play TF2 now!
:D thanks
Bai
have fun FlareChaser
I'll still be in the chat, ping me if you need me.
you feel hot because your sweat can't evaporate that well
1. Katara and their daughter are both waterbenders, so they have that connection. 2. Aang would have had to spend a LOT of time with Tenzin
I always seem to find the unusual stuff
hey FlareChaser
I usually think fanfics, to me, are kind of boring to read through..
What kind of store was it that you went to?
FlareChaser: I need you to dance with me!
some 2nd hand store
its like goodwill
I personally like the readings better then reading for fanfics
FlareChaser
uh..I think it was Mic the Microphone zero's reading of My little Dashie that made me cry xD
they use to have better stuff before but now its rare to find something actually good there

TheHoodyNinja: little kids love it
TheHoodyNinja: she has wings, so she probaly goes to your house and ponies47 maybe
panda: little kids are stupid
squink?
superretroworld: no shes right here
TheHoodyNinja: hey, we all were little kids once
well they are like 3-5 years old TheHoodyNinja
TheHoodyNinja: I'm a clone of the real Fluttershy but I act just like her. Ponies47 lives in my cottage in Ponyville silly filly :)
panda: We had ladybugs in my kindergarten class as pets, and i was the only one who was like "What the ever-loving fuck?"
Ponies47: Changeling!
TheHoodyNinja: well that explains everything
wha? was your school too cheap for hamsters?
And Hasbro thought this wasn't offensive?
Oh, wait, I mean parents
how is it offensive
me as well TheHoodyNinja, but... i was understanding enough to know that everyone has their own likes
it's offensive to my brain
so much squinking
Dken2021: No, we had ladybugs tho, and I thought it was completely pointless
Squink usually means the crossing of eyes, I think.
/me squinks until his arms explode
this is so weird, watching spike and pinkie pie in G3, what year was this?
isnt that squint ?
TheHoodyNinja: Nope you see I'm not a clone I'm a Fluttershy from a diffrent Universe, But I act just like your Fluttershy
I think somewhere around 2002
"friendship and fun, all in one=tea party?"
Well, that was certainly interesting. Hey there everypony! n_n
and the plot is catching up now
Ponies47: The internet spans dimensions? Awesome
lali-ho Polydunami!
hi Polydunami havent seen you in a while
Inb4 invitations
I see ponies
I must be on something
I Squinked so hard I got an idea... hm... sounds like a drug ^^

Because if I come here, I can never leave.
O goodness I better get to bed. Lovely talking to all of you goodnight everypony -Fluttershy
Ponies47: Interesting... Tell me, how are computers made in Equestria? I mean, how do you type with hooves? Or do you use your wings?
nighty Ponies47
hey Caramel, um... are you afk?
So who brings ponies to us right now?
night Ponies47
Nevermind, I know who it is

i wonder if ponies can control computers with their minds?
took them long enough to get to the PLOT!
/me now imagines them singing songs from Sweeny Todd :| "These are probably the worst pies in London..."
Voice acting is surprisingly good
/me flys into the sky and strikes panda with a cookie shower
unicornia
kick logic out and so the impossible?
*do
Polydunami: you mean the voices are good or the voices match the ones on the show?
Dken2021: FUCK LOGIC!
TheHoodyNinja: Ponies47 brought his computer when he moved in woth me. With big hoofs it's kind of hard for the both of us to type but we manage :) Fluttershy
TheHoodyNinja, the first one
*with

I'm goint to pretend I never saw this terrible boxbot and leave. Slowly. Do not turn your back. Just back away slowly...
SuperBrony64: wait, really?
Alicoen_Prince_Shane: I'm not Ponies47! I'm Fluttershy! Ponies47 moved into my cottage. He was drugged and he is asleep. I was just making sure he got some sleep. And Ponies47 is a Pegasus like me. - Fluttershy

Rainbow dash says "darling" WAAAAAAAY too much
Its creeping me out
/me peeks into the stream
MLPSurprise: its whatever you want it to be
Is it over yet?
otakon: leave whil you have the chance ^^
/me see's it's not and runs away screaming...
otakon: No, but my computer is about to run out of power :p
/me sighs
Hi Everyone
TheHoodyNinja: PLUG IT IN!
so... what made Val want to stream this madness?
They ACTUALLY gave invitations.
NINJAZZ!
Oh... This...
Ninjazz|Depressed: what's wrong man?
35 percent, turns off at 5%
Midnight_Tempest: he likes this.
This day... SUCKED.
/me glomps Ninjazz :3
Midnight_Tempest: I have NO idea
otakon: cant find the power cable
Hey, Polydunami!
/me hugs Ninjazz|Depressed
TheHoodyNinja: you better find it!
Ninjazz|Depressed: Wat happen
/me glomps Ninjazz|Depressed
well, thats cool... mute button is my friend and the music i have playing makes this silly
AAHHHHAHA
Midnight_Tempest: Someone said they disliked Eureka 7 while it was starting, and now this happened. :I
otakon: If i wake up my mom looking for it i have to go to bed instantly
ouch
D:
So much ping.
well, anyway guys it's nearly 2 am
Wait, somepony doesn't like Eureka 7?
so I'm off for the night
Its a miracle i got the laptop up here anyway
Can't handle that amount in this mood.
Goodnight otakon ;)
there needs to be a sign when Val is streaming... 'LEAVE YOUR OPINIONS AT THE DOOR OR GTFO!'
nighty otakon
Sleep well, otakon
Polydunami: Dermathil dones't
Cya otakon!
bye otakon sweet dreams
Midnight_Tempest: sounds like oppression to me
Hey guys, what's happening in this str-- . . . ABANDON STREAM! ABANDON STREAM!
bye otakon
allo Sebiale
Good night, otakon.
Caramel: I would say thank you for the stream but.........G3. Anyway, take care off to bed I go.
Midnight_Tempest: Can i stand at the door and watch?
Hey Sebiale, welcome to history
Anyways, yeah, thanks everyone that cared. :)
otakon: lol "...but G3.bye" haha
13sleep time. .
13nacht ponies~
Another sticky situation? *perv face*
Also, I don't even know who Dermathil is...
Gnight Shizuschlafen. Take care.
nighty Shizuschlafen
bye Shizuschlafen
They must be squished in those costumes pretty awkwardly.
And goodnight Shizuschlafen :3
And I guess we're only going to have TheHoodyNinja as long as his computer lasts, too.
gudbai Shizuschlafen
Night Shizuschlafen! Sleep well!
ugh
Ive seen bigger
YOU FAIL
What's up with the ladybigs?
honestly... whenever Val streams, i dont say shit about anything... its just easier than way...
so is this the climax?
Stop singing and work on the party
also, if you dont like something... dont say you dont like it, just dont watch the damn thing...
I've learned it's just best to just go do something else for a while...
Spike is awesome in this. :3
Spyro? Is that you? Is this what he does between games?
Until Val plays that awesome robot game.
It's Spike
Seriously
Lol.
ikr
well act I was useless
Ninjazz|Depressed: Is Ereuka 7 in that game?
/me puts hand down
G3 Spike really reminds me of one of the Koopa Kids.
Actually, I believe so, TheHoodyNinja.
*Crickets*
lol?
G3 spike is a fatass
Lol.
G3 Spike reminds me of Barney
PINKIE RAISE
crazypony: but is g4 spike that looks like him...
they're being fancy?
OF COURSE Lyra comes in on the finger discussion
How do ponys do the "pinky-finger sip"?
ponies*
idk...
Rule Britannia in a kids show?
Wow
history lesson!
oh god mods.
A song about proper tea ettiquit...
WHY
/me ragequit
Hey, Flare.
allo FlareChaser
The ladybugs will eat my liver...
28% remaining
I give him proprs for the singing voice.
I have a feeling the mods actually like this.
Just Val, I hope.
Sassy aren't they . . .
LYRA!
I bet there's another one of these hidden around the net somewhere
In my grand fanfic concept, G3 is the distant future of G4. So how about G3 Spike and G4 Spike being one and the same... and serving as a historian of the great pony war that happened when he was young.
those ladybugs are overly girly
Alice's tea part involved psychotic individuals . . . intentional reference. :P
I used to rip the wings off of ladybugs when i was 4
now i know why
lol
You crazy, man.
Lol, ikr
Last time I was here, I was given a lecture on the mutation of the definition of brony by Ghosties
Sew and Sew?
Oh, you were here for that, Polydunami?
05hey folks
How he went on about... Sethisto?
RD and Scootaloo?
Hey, Wrek!
Ohai Wrek
05gona get me some coffy and another hours of rest
lali-ho Wrek
hi Wrek welcome to hell
05and shit
I was the one who prompted the lecture in the first place, Ninjazz
Wrek: kk :D
05then maybe work some more on spitfire
Also, hey there Wrek :3
Ninjazz|Depressed: well... hopefully you feel better
/me 10licks Wrek
:3
Those ladybugs are stage hogs.
05TheHoodyNinja I was already there
Ahhh, I don't think I recall all the details, Polydunami.
/me pulls RainBroDash off of Wrek
I wasn't here for that. How was the attitude surrounding previous generations?
panda: I will. Just this day needs to end on a better note. Thanks for caring, man. :)
ok, screw it, I'm heading to bed there's so much G3 I can only take
The legs....
Ninjazz|Depressed: so problem, anything for a pal /)
panda: what happen?
no*
Gnight Dken2021. Take care!
Dken2021: night night
panda: Screw that man. *hugs*
:3
Basically, the mods are getting fed up by the idea that fans are trying to become better than each other
/me hugs Ninjazz|Depressed "hehe"
/me pets drf
Rather than simply trying to enjoy the show
night all of you, enjoy the G3
The G3 socks are scarfs
Yeah, I remember that talk, Polydunami.
Fans are doing that?
Polydunami: every fan better than me lol
Don't think like that. Seriously
Hello
BronyJenkins: yeah... some of them. not us though
Hey Vinyl :)
Hey, Vinyl!
I aint done shit for community
hi Vinyl
Thank god we aren't. xD
You don't need to, man. Just being you on this chat is one thing.
I just thought that was going to be a ickroll
DACE STRIDER
what the fuck
rickroll*
*DAVE
Oh... sweet Celestia...
Spike's got swag...
dat rap
SONIC BOOM
WAHT
disco.... dash..... seems legit
Racism
Egad
Let's see if Guile's theme fits with this.
Swag spike is best spike.
Speaking of disco, we lost Robin Gibb today
Test
This is actually entertaining
Wait, is that disco?
10% battery
11*
Poor RObin Gibb. D:
Why can't you go charge, TheHoodyNinja?
Robin Gibb of The Bee-gees
Polydunami: oh no
Oh no, Polydunami! D:
Good night, TheHoodyNinja.
Ninjazz|Depressed: dont know where the cord is and dont wanna wake mom up
Kandarihu: got another 10 minutes tops
TheHoodyNinja: well... you should get a flashlight and search
I'm hiring Swag Spike for a night club.
dat sir mix a lot
TheHoodyNinja: Why can't you use your ninja powers, man? :D
G3 spike is now the new Vinyl Sratch
We actually lost Donna Summer a few days ago too... so disco has taken a big hit
/me is turning into Swag Spike
shake your cutie... hm....
Ninjazz|Depressed: Who do you think taught me my skills, runs in the family
So apparently Guile's theme does go well with this. :D
:3
TheHoodyNinja: Good point...
If your laptop is configured any way like mine, it won't run all the way down to 0% before automatically shutting down.
/me glomps Swag_Spike XD
/me glomps panda back. :3
/me tackle hugs Swag_Spike
Kandarihu: ok i got maybe 3-4 minutes before it hits 5% and suts off
TOO MUCH SWAG. CAN't CONTROL SELF.
/me hugs everypony
CRUSH. KILL. DESTROY. SWAG.
Yep. Pinkie Pie knows what's going on xD
O__O
Use your hair for streamers
I actually loved every second of the rap.
Those streamers xD
I'm BACK!
Hey, MahBoi777!
Hey DeathStar!
Hey there DeathStar!
Swag_Spike: it was actually entertaining
I'M back!

Ninjazz|Depressed: why are you depressed :(
HEY Ninjazz|Depressed!
/me hugs DeathStar "your back!"
......WHY U DEPRESSED?

Polydunami: hm?
DeathStar: Today SUCKED! Haven't sleeped at all, failed a spanish exam, just plain bad mood. Sucked. Sucked. Sucked.

This weekend got about half as much sleep as usual for me
It doesnt get any more pleasant
I'm tuckered out
Awww.
Hello!
That means you're leaving, Polydunami? :S
Hey Kriel_Pony!
hello bronystate!
Soon enough, I guess
Hey Tassadork!
Hello Tassadork :)
hmmmmm, I'm guessin someone asked for ponies?
hey Tassadork!
So I am still new... so I must ask... what... what is this that I am seeing?
Or Val was just feeling Vally.
The horror that is G3
lol
Kriel_Pony: well... its g3 ponies
MahBoi777, somepony expressed dislike for Eureka 7
wow still at it i se
Dammit, Val what the hell?
Ahhhh, so that's why...
well im out, bye gaiz
Polydunami: THOSE FOOLS
MahBoi777: Nope, someone said that they disliked Eureka 7 while it was on the OP
lol
Golakka: dont complain :|
the costume designs are actually alright
MahBoi777: OHAU
Gnight, twilight_sprinkler! Take care.
OHAI*
See you twilight_sprinkler :)
night twilight_sprinkler
I know panda, but i feel the need to take a risk :p
hey Pinkies4thWall!:D
It is... disquieting...
Lol.
MahBoi777: I'm eating
I've already gone through 4 songs... How long is this?...
probably hours
panda: who requested ponies!
Ninjazz: It's 1 hour.
And 20 minutes.
Are you kidding? Please say so...
Damn... how far in is it?
I like ponies :D
As do I. :P
Ninjazz: Nope, not kidding.
lol
This is the best thing ever, though. D:
Spell-of-Gaming: Mein Gott.
I'm going to need to get a playlist up then...
heheh
This is almost done, actually.
oh my gott, they are marching in time to my current tune, Enter Sandman :p
DeathStar: oh... well someone was btiching about eureka 7 so.... val/ Caramel put on g3 ponies.
allright, youtube, don't fail me now
"Sleep with one eye open"
Have I attacked you yet, MahBoi777?
panda: oh deer
/me attacks MahBoi777 with hugs
Imagine waking up and seeing one of those monstrosities standing over you
/me shudders
DeathStar: im actually getting used to the previous generations... so...
Great. Now I am going to have nightmares tonight.
Ninjazz|Depressed: O U:D
So Caramel put on something I like for someone bitching? :D
:)
panda: yeah you do grow immune after a bit
I fear for your sanity if you really do like this. 6_9
Sleep with one eye open Kriel_Pony
If one of those things were there when I woke up... I'd think someone was wearing a costume and trying to murder me :O
Well, I liked Swag SPike and his rap, and the rest is actually standable.
Swag_Spike: well... to be honest I dont mind... if I can get used to the SOS i got this in the bag
2,14 you can't call yourself a brony if you don't enjoy this
^^^^^^^^^^^^
*slowly going insane*
Why call myself a brony?
I'm not a brony, then. :P
I missed spike rapping?
Caramel: Clearly, you can
I dont suffer from insanity
Caramel: I do i do i do!
I enjoy every moment
/me slowing has wall-eyes
Caramel: it's makes me laugh! I love it
this is great! i love it
Although by muting it and putting Kanye West's Power on, it becomes a lot more interesting
my eyes are glued
not sure what to think really
pfft, They are marching in time to enter sandman, its funny
Cider!
and utterly petrofying
Wait, I messed up
TEA
It's spike! :D
TEA TIEM
SAY IT WITH ME
TEA
Look guys, the generation that we know and love had to come from somewhere. The previous generations paved the way to what made G4 AWESOME! the characters from the generations were put into a boiling pot and stirred and... ah screw it
.... very well. Tea.
The biggest tea party in the world?
MahBoi777: think of it like it was written to mock girls shows of the time and it's funny
aye SuperBrony64
oops
Suprise :p
haha why are we watching this lol
good try panda =)
DeathStar: I can do that, lol thank you
panda: Well, at the beginning of the new generation, they took a bit from it but really built from the ground up
Tried to defend it several times, panda. Argument still invalid. :P
because soembody asked val to "play ponies"
I love the angle of minty's face at that one second
so he did :p
pony_2765: some one pissed off the streamer
I tried, but its gonna fall on deaf ears anyways
oh
lol
well this doesnt bother me
but
NO TEA PARTY?!
oh no!
oh noes!
inb4 pinkamena
Ooh

Actually, she's pink. but whatever.

This F*CKING Day Aria is already here :P
Oh hey Pinkies4thWall, long time no see :)
Ohai Ninjazz|Depressed. What's got you down?
This day was meant to be perfect
Pinkie pie's legs shouldn't bend that way'

/me breaks into the BronyState liquor cabinet and drinks himself to death...
Polydunami: I C U

Sumica: i gots to go
Hai, btw. :3
awwww bye Pinkies4thWall! take care
Sumica: yes :D

/me shares cheese with MahBoi777
Sumica: jokes on Caramel though, I'm enjoying myself ^^
Bye Pinkies4thWall!
CHEESE
Oh god what is this.

Okay
I feel sorry for the people who are in those costumes. Must suck...
Ninjazz|Depressed: there is a lot that this pony has seen... and has fought tooth and nail to maintain sanity ^^
Bye Pinkies4thWall!
/me waves goodbye to sanity
panda: And yet you're losing that war, apprently. :D
He's already gone
Swag_Spike: hey when do you have school?
Hello.
sanity is relative. It gets better depending on physical difference from relatives
I fear the time when such a sensation of this live action ends
Ninjazz|Depressed: maybe... but at least i still have a grasp ^^
And yes, in 40 minutes.
panda: Aye. Don't take me for raw chicken either. I've seen some shit! :O
Sanity is in the way
talk about pulling out teh big gunz, darn complainers lol
dat songwriting
Wait, I dunno where I was going with that :S
Ninjazz|Depressed: raw chicken? hehe
SparklyWaffles: yeah. Making large numbers of children happy and putting food on the table... it just isn't worth getting in those costumes... actually, I'll bet it IS
Oh God... whyyyhyyyy.... *headdesks*
/me dances like a tea pot
Dagnabbit Spike
I kind of want to start drinking tea now
Raw... chicken?
panda: What's wrong with raw chicken? D:
/me IS drinking tea. Ujelly?
I need Irish tea. Hold the tea
=/
Ninjazz|Depressed: no, just the way you worded that
Polydunami: I forgot to say hi, Hi Polydunami! lol:P
Actually what I meant is that I feel sorry for the people in the costumes, it must get hot in there after such a long time. xD
Why yes. Yes I am.
Hey MahBoi777, I had a busy weekend

Do you enjoy this, panda?! :D

/me bursts into flames...

scoots is preparing to eat your soul
SparklyWaffles: get your offerings and give them to Caramel, well... if you wanna live
Kriel_Pony1: the server doesn't know your connection dropped, and it won't until it tries to ping your old nick and gets nothing. That's when you can get your nick back.
guys have u seen ny brothers girl friend becuase she has been missing for 5 days now
/me bursts into plama trails
plasma*
JRP2234: you are asking a bunch of geeky guys if they have seen a girl? really? :)
I see a mantra
;~;
GAH
no
O__________O
JRP2234: what's her nick?
no
Kandarihu: Thanks. Figured it was something liek that. Terribly inconvenient.
O_O
OH GOD
shes missing
aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooohkaaaaaaaay.
/me throws earphones across the room
;~;
RyunosukeKnT: I'm a girl silly

This is me right now
http://images.smh.com.au/2009/08/17/682806/jets-420x0.jpg
JRP2234: I'll contact the milk carton company immediately
What the
G3 rolled
Something like that happens to me too.
Okay. Zalgo roulette. I stop the stream on...
police are looking for her
still better than g3 live?
G3.5 sweetiebelle is horror
NORMAL eyes!
Dafuq is my brain doing?...
Caramel I ADMIT IT!!!!!!!! JUST STOP!
/me dares Caramel to show soem G3.5
jesus how horrifying...
HA! YOU LOSE panda!
ya, had to shut that down :)
Golakka, who?
JRP2234: has she ever come on here?
caramel = val i belive :s
You know, I don't think this is going to get the people who hate Eureka 7 to like it more.
sure it will
so... we are still getting trolled... cool, cool...
Ninjazz|Depressed: no, i didnt loose!
/me gets into feetle position
Hello.
Anybody there?
panda: You gave! You gave! :D
nyan cat
Ninjazz|Depressed: my life is more important!
EonMastor: this is torture. It only hardens the victims against the whims of the torturer.
okay toss up question, which would you rather see, Battleship movie + Star Wars Ep. 1-3 3d or G3 ponies? >:)
This isn't TOO bad...
/me does some stuff while scootaloo finishes her seisure
oh mighty mod Caramel please deliver us from this monster
what did i return too
Oh, I tried the Zalgo roulette and came up with Zalgo
enough torture, and the victims will crack
THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS!
panda: You lost then. :P
DELIVER US
Ninjazz|Depressed: no... you loose... you are risking your life
*cries* MAKE IT STTOOOOOPP
panda: I has stream muted. :P
Dammit, I dont need a headache before i start a new job
what did i come back to
it will never stop
:O
I can see clearly now, the rain has gone.
oh shit
RUN DaringDude!
If the victims are confined, they will say anything that the captors want in order to make the torture stop. In an interrogation, this can result in unreliable information.
Ninjazz|Depressed: as do I, but.... the image... burning my retinas
WOOT
SuperBrony64 I NEED U ASAP
/me runs like hell
I feel ALIVE!
oh Caramel... u so silly with the trolling...
Pinkies4thWall: how do u live through this
However, we are not confined here. And I'm supposed to be sleeping. And so is my computer.
panda: That's why you stare directly into chat... Do not give it... POWER.... RESIST...
all those host closures :)
@﹏@
Yeah
*whimpers* ...make it end...
This is aesthetically offensive, but not morally offensive, so I have no reason to stick this out. Good night everypony. I'll see you in the morning, when someone decent is streaming.
One more Zalgo roulette.
o/
See you Kandarihu :)
Gnight Kandarihu. Take care and sleep well.
bye Kandarihu
gnight Kandarihu!
I'm going to keep doing the roulette until it ends on normal eyes
And pray Scootaloo stays away.
Goodnight Kandarihu
i find this suitable punishment for people that complain during streams... i think it should be played everytime someone bitches during the stream
Midnight_Tempest: I just mute it and watch Anthology
Midnight_Tempest: And have people like you and I get punished in the process?
I love the streams
Oh my
i'm laughing and screaming at the same time
thank gawd
Ninjazz|Depressed: its the price we have to pay...
awwwwww
Midnight_Tempest: the problem is, this is punishing EVERYONE, including the people who were perfectly content earlier. And you have to admit that this is heavy handed.
yay
its over!!!
Midnight_Tempest: It's too steep...
Huzzah!
Did I say something?
hello applebloom, the 80's called :)
Ey... This I can live with.
/me glomps DaringDude
Kandarihu: there is a solution... turn off the stream, or mute it... problem solved
/me ish glomped
Ninjazz|Depressed: Actually I like this one
yay, I am now officially a brony
oh hai there buddy
My mind, Its full of fuck
2,14 a solution some people find incredibly difficult
Aye, Kriel_Pony.
I'M SO PROUD TT_TT
well shit, now I have to go watch that video
Atleast it seperates the weat from the chaff Caramel
to youtube!
indeed Caramel...
There are still fiv... four lights.
I'd think that you get used to it by the amount of times you show it, Val.
The torture was worth it for this :P
And this doesn't help for people who were waiting for Caramel to stream something else.
spin spin spin spin
2,14 you're implying I was trying to fix anything
meatspin
Go forth and rotate best pony

@_@

/me bows to Caramel, "I offer you my soul"
can't... look... away....
She's... hypnotizing...
A lot of people believe you were trying to fix the attitude of those who were complaining about Eureka 7, right?
go AppleBloom go! get that tail!
Umm
Oh sweet jesus
lol
OH GOD
/me fastens his seatbelt again
GOOD LORD
T,T

/me sighs

*laughs insanely*
AH!
Hmmm... still got Anthology qued up...

Caramel: well... you are the mod after all
Huh?

OH NO IT'S NOT WORKING

http://www.troll.me/images/asdasdasdasdasdasd/whoa-we-got-a-bad-ass-over-here.jpg
I hope BronyStates isnt dying... I just got here...
Caramel, calm down... dont let them get to you. :) just kick them
We love you really caramel / val
/me sighs
Kriel_Pony: brony state isnt dying... people are just idiots
This always happens.

Someone gets pissed. Val gets pissed.
Nothing works out.

Polydunami: Bring it on! lol

As always, there's a little old dog at the foot of my blanket
You HAVE to. It's the rules.
Man, Spidey gots some moves.

hen3ry: thanks for the directions
Kriel_Pony: u read the rules yet if not u should cause u dont wanna b kicked it sux :(
Kriel_Pony: Oh my. First lesson to learn is to not care about other people's view on you, especially when it is a pointless hate.
Kriel_Pony: DaringDude has a point. It ain't fun to say the least
I asked. He did
ookeee
good
DaringDude: Yup, first thing I did. Then the FAQ, THEN the stream itself.
I've been kicked before
Ninjazz|Depressed why are you depressed?

Kriel_Pony there was a bitch in my Gr. 9 science class about . . . 10+ years ago. She hated science, but it didn't help that Samantha and I were both in her class

I'm here almost every night, Kriel_Pony :P
DuskStarshimmer you mean TwiPie, for one. And two, not me. I'm not one for ship fics
I'm not even sure what TwiPic stands for.
OtakuTom: Well, I have been here every night for the last three, and never before!
I'm horrible at fighting off sleep..
hey SuperBrony64, how come you are still up?
ah, TwiPie makes a bit more sense.
MahBoi777: i feel ya man
hi SuperBrony64
OtakuTom: Well, I tihnk it was three. First time I was here it was this same game.
Ah, that may be why...I haven't been on a whole lot the past couple days...just kinda jumping in and out a lot. I'll be here for a while tonight.
GHETTOOOOO BEAAAAMMMUUUU
Did my chat derp
panda: I've fallen asleep during the stream all week:S
Yup
It derped
Spell-of-Gaming eeyup
MahBoi777, yeah... face to keyboard ^^
i used to stay up til 6:00 am in pre-k
i rarely even watch the stream anymore... mostly just to see this get played...
I Probably won't be here much tommorow... Diablo with friends then Dragon's Dogma at midnight.
MahBoi777: try going to bed at a reasonable hour :P
panda and MahBoi777 I know how both of you feel. That's why I have a beer infront of me . . . LoLz
Ryanier128: haha drinking makes me sleepy though
I SHOULD go to bed now, but... I will probably be here until my laptop gives out
panda I guess it's different for everypony. Mind you, I got drunk on my 18th birthday, so . . .
Kriel_Pony: aww :( but then we wont know when you are gone :(
Ryanier128: :) I've never really been dunk >.>
panda: Well, I will probably sign off when it gives me a low battery signal.
I can;t get drunk.
panda lucky bastard
I am allergic.
Kriel_Pony: :)
I actually break out in hives when I drink.
pfft... i got drunk when i was 15... then i got really drunk when it was legal for me to drink...
Ryanier128: haha not really... its cuz I havent drunk gallons of the stuff
Kriel_Pony ouch, I feel really sorry for you
That's a good reason not to get drunk! :D
Where did Seapony Lyra and Octaviapus come from?
Ryanier128: Kinda makes me permanent DD
desktop ponies, Eddmario
Ninjazz|Depressed: Agreed.
Good morning! :D
Hey Major_Frank.
mornin Major_Frank
Major_Frank: 'ello stranger
panda take my advise: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AVOID GETTING DRUNK AT ALL COSTS!!! Go for tipsy, the hangover is liveable
So they were in the Desktop Ponies before all the fan art of them started then?
hello Major_Frank
Ryanier128: haha, and eat a lot crackers
hi Major_Frank
:)
Eddmario: not sure what you mean, but i found it with a google search.
I mean was is JJ who created them?
maybe not sure
I don't think JJ does Pixel Art.
Specifically, where did they come from?
SIMON!
aww missed it
I cannot get over how over the top every single vanilla attack is in this game
Eddmario: I think he thought yo meant where did they come from on screen
panda never tried that before, I should write that down . . . Ritz or Soda Crackers?
Ryanier128: ginger snaps ^^
I know Cteno was created by pony R34 artist Slugbox
'the fate of my soul rests on bashing this mook'
Ohhhh Snap! :D
/me is getting more tired.
panda ugh, never mind. My stomach just doesn't agree with ginger
Ryanier128: well, when you are drunk it will XD
panda: doesnt your stomach tend to get less agreeable when drunk?
must stay awake =_=
people that are tired should sleep...
Kriel_Pony: yes, with other things. Its like when you are sea sick or car sick. eat some ginger snaps or drink ginger ale and it will take away that feeling
The person currently streaming should stream some Megas XLR episodes one night.
NEVAH!
well, i've been up for long enough. Bye everypony!
crazypony: Night!
hey kids im back! :D
Byebye crazypony :)
Gnight crazypony. Take care.
seeya crazypony
moon pawnch
Cave_Tempest: But... there are no ginat robots in sleep
Flare, you're here?
Kriel_Pony: but when drunk, you should eat things that are starchy and bread-like so it soaks up your acids.
bye Ninjazz|Depressed
Huh?
hi FlareChaser
Ello FlareChaser
hi Ryanier128
I am not leaving.
Kriel_Pony: of course there are... you dream of them, piloted by ponies...
Cave_Tempest: If I could control my dreams...
Kriel_Pony: you can... you just need to try...
Cave_Tempest: To be honest, I actually have nightmares every single night.
It is possible to controll your awn dreams
FlareChaser: hehe, I cant fav that more than once!
panda: yes, yes you can :3
:D
FlareChaser: I will accept your gift.
FlareChaser: so... are you, with octavia now? D:
Kriel_Pony: Actually, its mine :|
panda: yeah.
i havent had a nightmare in years...
haha. c'mhere, I wanna hit you with my gun
FlareChaser: :(
''The only real nightmare starts when you wake up''
~
FlareChaser . . . I don't know if I'm repelled or attracted to that pic . . .
panda: why the sad face? me and Colgate talked about it and we're all happy.
I don't have nightmares often, but when I do they're quite random
FlareChaser nevermind Samantha just slapped me across the face
Major_Frank: Try having a dram about ritual scarification and then having your arm be numb where the cuts were and backing up that claim.
FlareChaser: :( i just know she didnt want it to end that way ^^
Thanks for the tip Kriel_Pony will try :)
Major_Frank: Not trying to be depressing or anything. Sleep really jsut isnt pleasant for me.
panda: alas, I didnt either. but me and Tavi are happy now ~<3
that is a cool looking mecha
<3 thats good FlareChaser :F
I have this wonderfull thing called Melotanine
Or however you write it
oh... FlareChaser, whats next from you? ^^
panda: probably a beef sandwich.
melanine?
No wait..
i think he means melatonin
/me google..
FlareChaser: xD
Kriel_Pony one time I had a dream where I was eating this really good burger, like the BEST, and juices are flowing down my cheek. I suddenly wake up and there's drool all over my pillow
Ryanier128: i think everyone has had those dreams before
I just made myself hungry, damn.

FlareChaser drink imaginary beer or a near-beer. It's alcohol content is so low, you need to drink 40 just to get tipsy
/me creates a leg of ham and places it in MahBoi777 s hand
/me makes mental note not to read screen while mid-sitting, can cause funny misreads
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: What did the sandwitch ever do to you?

Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I am going to have a moment of silence for the poor sanwich. it's dreams of being a snack will never come true.

I think giant robots make moments of silence better.
Ganleon... saving the best for last
/me changes Ninjazz|Depressed to Ninjazz through the power of magic

11,02O.O
Kriel_Pony: you hit the nail on the head there
1: Ship otakon with everything. 2: have fun. Right?
Ryanier128: More like 1) Ship otakon with everything. 2) Get banned by Wrek.
In that order.
SuperBrony64, you know... you sound totally different than what I imagined
00,10Time to go prevent my bed from flying away. take care

Kammerjunk whatever you do, do NOT mix Captain Morgan and Gatorade. The hangover is un-bearable
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: It's all the rules. I don''t think this is jsut about you.
at least we get awesome music for this, lol

Ryanier128: lol imma try dat now.
awesome music indeed
the rules are read while non-fitting but awesome music plays
/me is gonna make a daquiri now
Ryanier128: You have only succeeded in making me more curious about it.
TOOT
PartyCannon: shhhh
Dramatic Rules!
Midnight_Tempest: It fits doesnt it! :D
FlareChaser|Vodka and Kammerjunk don't say I didn't warn you
the white just makes it worse lol
Ryanier128: I am goin ot eb fien bro
Ryanier128: I haven't actually had a hangover yet. Either I don't drink enough or I drink WAY too much and throw it all up.
Only thing missing is Val reading it out loud in a stern voice. :D
note to self dont do anything if val or wrek is streaming
inquiry, however: "Lottery?"
/me is immune to hangovers
I have a +20 defence against hangovers.
hen3ry yes, the lottery for the movies and pony eps on Brony Movie Night
HEY GUYS< I got this.

hen3ry: how new are you?
I'm going to work on my Fan-Fiction. See you tomorrow everypony!
inb4 a storm
bye Ryanier128
Val and Wrek are the most stern streamers... you dont fuck with them or argue in any way... its just a good idea to never disagree with a mod at anytime...

bai Ryanier128
Cya Ryanier128! Takre care.
/me does sexytime with Octavia.
yay
bye Ryanier128! take it easy

Meh. I was never really a hater.
Midnight_Tempest: imagen how meanwhile would feel
/b/wars?
Nope.

I was a hater on TF2.
2,14 Flarechaser: all the way back during the beginning?
Caramel: yeah man.
2,14 thank fucking god
4chan. shudder. Went once, never again.
2,14 I thought I was the only one left
:D
Caramel: Afraid not... I resisted for a long time.
Ahahaha, no way dude! I'm a really old Brony, like old old.
2,14 glad to hear it
hen3ry: It's a pretty boring place once you get used to people swearing at each other like they just discovered curse words.
Caramel I do recall
ive been a brony for a year, but only been on Bronystate for about 5 months...
Yes, but the rule34 burns.
2,14 all the old guys from back in like, October have all but disappeared
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: lern your brony history man!
2,14 I rather miss them...
Kammerjunk: I never got the appeal
>october

>old guys
hen3ry: we cant speak about that stuff hear, well I guess we can! but cant post it :P

2,14 October of 2010 PartyCannon -_-
Caramel ah
i heard about the MLP fights on /b/
That's the board I'm talking about. It's a boring place.
but on Bstate?
4chan > any other site except Bronystate.
I beg to differ.
was that when there was no more pony posting allowed on 4chan?
DaringDude: eyup
But I have to go, anyway. I shall abscond!
i went of the /b/ board of 4chan
first thing i saw
Cya Kammerjunk! Take care.
We would just post when they were gone though:)
Kammerjunk: I shall carry on the fight in your name.
is too inappropiate for Bstate
/me clears throat
bai Kammerjunk|School
I beg to differ.
looks like lyra approves
i based by baldwin lol
*passed
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: no need for dramatic pauses you can just use fiull stopes
*full stops*

Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ok... i dont know that one... it must have something to do with Rule 34...
The internet can be of two things: your best friend or worst nightmare.

CrimsonPhoenix: I am a quick learner.
Rarity is of course
DaringDude: Rarity.
dammit
/me loves and tolerates
he probably didn't even get to see it
Rule 51... so true...
Kriel_Pony: I already like you
Ghosties: Still, it is nice to meet you. A formal introduction, so to speak, except entirely informal.
Kriel_Pony...
You are a very smart man!!! :D
oz funny cause raarity on my list is worst of mane 6v:D
Ninjazz|Depressed: I am aware!
:|
DaringDu-u-u-ude
we all got differnt opinions
:3
Atleast there are some sane people in here! ;)
Everyone knows nopony is wost than the other
I know, man. Can't change the world.
CrimsonPhoenix: Except Trixie.
CrimsonPhoenix: Well, thank you! I don't really know you very well but I think I like you too. I generally like people. Glass half full type.
04Yes, I suppose that makes sense Kriel
04In any case
there are no sane people here... at least im not sane, i could snap and try to hunt you all down at any moment :)
02was jk XD
04Does anybody here have Steam
Oh yeah I haven't introduce myself, where are my manners
i do Ghosties
I got Steam.
Ghosties: I do, in fact.
04Does anybody here have Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic through Steam?
Ghosties: i do
hey all
04Okay
:P
or were you
04So then, have you used any mods on your Kotor?
no...
i havent played it very much
DaringDude: haha, dat implying i actually went to sleep.
gah going to be another hard and boring night
lol
04Well then
04I'm shit out of luck
I'm freakin tired as hell...
wait what? o////o
how so Ghosties? trying to find someone that can tell you how to mod it?
Ninjazz|Depressed: Any reason you can't sleep?
Kriel_Pony: Just me fighting it off. Not really.
8,1DeathStar: i'm always naked
im procrastinating for schoool
8,1under my clothes, especially
oh my o////o
Why you don't have clothes under your clothes?
Fix the problems.
02I was, it wouldn't have gone anywhere near him xD
clothesception
/me 8,1hugs Ninjazz|Depressed
what about clothes under underclothes?
chastity belt?
Wait... Am I in danger?
8,1looks like somepony got a visit from the Depression Clown
Still naked under that.
8,1i love being naked
Ahahah. I see you noticed.
8,1except when i'm cold
DeathStar: Who doesn't?
Thanks for that.
8,1which is most of the time
when i was younger my parents couldntt keep my clothes on me XD
8,1i don't think my internal heating system works too well
04<Midnight_Tempest> how so Ghosties? trying to find someone that can tell you how to mod it? <-- Well see, I downloaded the Brotherhood of Shadow mod and patch and while it took me a while to find the TSL Patcher I did and got everything squared away...or so I though
04*thought
it should have
04Truth is that about a minute or so after I load my game it doesn't just crash my game, it doesn't just exit the software
according to my sources, the only part of the country (besides alaska and hawaii) that wouldn't have been able to see it was the east coast
/me sleeps on that wall of red text
04It shuts my whole damn computer off
O_O
Daayuum.
04I know
hmm... wow... thats one hell of a bug
Ghosties: Hmmm. And it is only in KoTOR wit hthe mod?
Indeed.
04And nobody has reported a problem like that
/me slaps Kyu
04Yes, with the mod
go fix the stats page
04Everything else is operating normally
07do whatnow?
04But the mod looks like it installed properly and everything
well night everypony nd Ghosties hope u fix dat problem soo :)
strange... do you have the most up to date version of the mod?
soon
04My game doesn't look any different
04Doesn't run slower or lag or anything
night DaringDude
Gnight DaringDude! Take care. Rarity. :|
04And yes, I have the most up to date version of the mod
Ghosties: When does it crash?
zzzz....
07uh
04About a minute or so after I load my game
07how
07o3o
Ghosties... can you tell me the version number of the mod?
o3o
Okay... have you tried going different directions or using different loads for that minute?
8,1DeathStar: have you ever destroyed a planet/

/me 8,1hugs DuskStarshimmer
/me hugs DuskStarshimmer very softly
Me too! :3
8,1DeathStar: aye right, like i'm believing that, ya big teuchter
%_%
8,1:P
Way too manny hugs yall
/me hugs DuskStarshimmer in an awkward stranger way
xD
._.
07I can only change the pages that have an edit button |D
just kiddin,
Just two, mang. You can hangle maor.
http://www.lugia.us/forum/help-and-feedback/user-stats-page-is-relatively-messed-up-for-me/msg293500/
/me bear hugs all who hugged me
You should have enough permissions to modify pages in the admin panel on the SMF forum
07oh
8,1DeathStar: so what you're saying is that Darth Vader... *sunglasses*... is your father?
8,1YEAAAAAAAAAAH
07THAT stats page
Yeah
04@Midnight_Tempest: Appears to be 1.0
I can fix the IRC stats page myself
Since that's under my jurisdiction
8,1DuskStarshimmer: are you okay?
And speaking of that
I should actually go fix it
I've just configuered my very own Unreal IRCd, :D Now I get to play with all sorts of neat intercommunicatory mumbo jumbogous things
02see, that's where drf lives
02XD
mornin bronystate
Ghosties: then that might be your problem...
anti*
8,1DuskStarshimmer: awesome
Hey Onyxia!
8,1Ninjazz|Depressed: are you okay?
04If that is indeed the case then why hasn't it been updated :/
8,1i mean, obviously, you're depressed
or right sleep, always right when I want to code; Goodnight BronyState
8,1but is there anything i can do to help?
Ghosties: try this, this is supposed to be the v1.07 patch for it... http://derpy.me/zVGdQ
8,1night DuskStarshimmer
no
Nah, man. I just need some time to cheer up is all. :)
he lives in michigan
Ghosties: should be some patch fixes in there
Gnight DuskStarshimmer!
Take care.
Ah yes Kyu
I was correct
The % stuff shouldn't be showing
It's an easy fix
Bah... stupid lockup... once again have th 1...
oh wait
Wow. We're better than EqD now.
actually yeah
8,1IT'S OFFICIAL
Deffo Ninjazz|Depressed, this place kicks EQD's arse
8,1WE'RE BETTER THAN EQD.
wow...
HUZZAH!
better than EQD...
Yay my oppinion is arbitartilly official!
we need a party
right now
the "# posts" part shouldn't be showing
that's what is screwing it up
04Thanks for that Duskstar
Party? But i was gunna sleeeeeep
Damn this chat and its low participants.
WAKE UP!
Quality over quantity Ninjazz|Depressed
Oh. I see.
i should be in bed myself... but im not tired yet, i will be soon though
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tigQMK-P9kk&feature=related check this you
8,1Ninjazz is doing his best Rage Against the Machine impression
lol
out*
yay, RATM <3
i said check this you O_O wta
I only compare unlike things, why else compare things?
Ghosties: I got kicked for a bit there. any progress?
Brony state is like television, and eqd is like the newspaper
television wins every time
untill the internet.
02oh
I can see the comparrison.
And you know... I don't go to EqD NEARLY as much as I come here.
Ghosties: hope what i sent you helps the problem...
finaly at home
yeah and EQD chat is always dead or borin g
Hey, Phase4!
here its always lively and alive
I still check EQD, you know, daily.
07yeah
o_____o how are you everypony!
07still trying to find where that is lol
I only went ot eqd for the chat, but sicne i got an irc client I have no need for their silly ajax/flash thing
04I appreciate the link, but it appears it was an outdated patch and the one I used on the mod is the most up to date one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7Z0apgiCZU anyone else remember this?
/me awkwarly hugs ResonantWaves and leave the room, saluting 'goodnight'
Ohey ResonantWaves!

night DuskStarshimmer|inso
Ghosties: ok... well... this Brotherhood of Shadows... is it just that or is it also the Solomon's Revenge mod?
Theres a fifth season coming out in October
and apparently its not just cgi theres live action as well
hm
04Solomon's Revenge mod
Live Action?...
No thanks.
windows! y u screw up clock so bad
Audiose Phase4!
07I've gone through most of the options
07all I can find is a check box that enables/disables user stats |D
Phase4: use this clock http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2507/
XD
DeathStar: It is always accurate.
shhh that blasphemy in these parts
The joke is that Dash is always shipped! :D
Ghosties: ok... Solomon's Revenge... lets see here... and try this patch for it http://derpy.me/fl98t
Ghosties: should make it v1.1
DeathStar, XD
It's not an option
You have to edit the CSS files
DeathStar, i actualy thought that would be the ponies or party clocks, and i'd find the images except mlfw's search appears to be broken right now
I'm trying to find the exact problem atm
Ninjazz|Depressed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7Z0apgiCZU
and god the hooh theme CSS files are messy as hell
http://www.lugia.us/forum/Themes/ho-oh/css/index.css
dat spacing
8,1i don't think i'll ever find love in this shitty shit hole of a town
Nostalgia does not help my mood, Shane.
Phase4: it's better when it's not expected :)
04Tempest, that's the original patch that I downloaded
8,1if i was younger, maybe
DeathStar, true dat
Ghosties: damn...
04So it should be completely up to date now
8,1but St Andrews is not the place for someone in their mid 20s
Time to move?
04And apparently nobody has experienced the same problem I have...it's maddening
8,1it's a place for kids and freshers
Kyu
I found it
04I just want to breathe some damn life into my game but for some reason I can't -_-
Search for .activity_stats li div.bar span in the index.css file
8,1Midnight_Tempest: well, the obvious solution here is for us to hook up.
Ghosties: Normally I would ask for your system specs but since KoTOR is pretty old I will asumme you are set
and change -1820C0Bem to -1000em
8,1DeathStar: i'm in the Scottish one
8,1DeathStar: well, the obvious solution here is for us to hook up.
lol
04Yeah, my system can run the game just fine
Ghosties: the only problem i can really think of is... it might be a conflict with steam as well...
04I'm just trying to figure out why in the hell it turns my whole laptop completely off
04But then why would it completely shut down my computer?
Ghosties: So, ruling out hardware because it is only the one game, and it is shutting down the whole computer, which is... extreme, in the best of cases. Have you tried some of the easy fixes, like running in compatibility mode?
04No, I haven't considered that
04I wouldn't know how, Kriel
this video is a perfect example of me after i get killed by someone in a video game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cspLMB0OjM0&feature=plcp
What OS?
Ghosties: it's not over heating you computer is it? (I may be wrong)
04Windows 7
07I should probably also ask how to get to index.css in the first place lol
04No it can't be, it's only for that game
er sec
lol
8,1indeed
Go to Configuration -> Themes and Layout
Then Modify Themes
Ghosties: Okay, with seven, right clikc on the link to the game (Or maybie steam, I am admittedly not sure, I dont use steam a whole lot)
8,1except an overabundance of hooking up
I have no idea which themes have that screwed up
So you'll most likely need to go through all of them
02Ohai NS
I would also suggest copying everything inside the file
ok, that should start in a second
Ghosties: either way, right click, properties, compatibility, then click the mark for "Run in compatibility mode" for windows XP
there we go
before editing
04Hmm, alright, I'll give it a try
Ghosties: it might be a windows 7 problem... i know Kotor doesnt like it at all
Stream is up, Phase4.
Some older games run better if windows is running what basically comes down to an emulator of an old OS
Oh I see you aleady knew that.
Anyway, have fun Kyu, tis' the index.css file, I'm going to shower then piano, will be back in 1-2 hours
I can see that meme happening.
Ninjazz|Depressed: I may accedentlly force it :)
:D
Either way, NEW MEME! WOO
OH MY GOD
BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL
02seeya NS
Never played this game
?
Oh no no no no! Just saying. :D
lol
is the stream actualy lagging or is it a joke?
oh snap
Joke.
mah chat
Phase4: Joke
iz on he screen
:D
lolol
Ninjazz|Depressed: ok lets not over do this right away
DeathStar: Yeah. :D
04You know, I wonder if Steam doesn't like cheating in Kotor
Stean doesn't like having fun.
Ghosties: Still no luck?
/me f2k Utah Symphony Orchestra - March (6chFLAC@3467kbps, 60.98mb/2:27)
i'll just take a photo and then go collect the money
Ninjazz|Depressed: or people might get annoyed like with otakon shipping
nothing will go wrongf
wrong'
04Because when I downloaded Solomon's Revenge it came with a save that's right at the Sith Academy where the beginning of the mod takes place
Phase4: play soem tf2 later :D
04And it has a "Cheat" message typed across the picture of the save
04And I actually can't find the option to run Kotor in XP
Ghosties: that could be a problem... though i didnt think the Kotor was VAC protected...
Ah
Ninjazz|Depressed: true but he might get anyed by thing pings after a bit
Gimme a minute, gotta boot up my desktop where I have steam
ill see if i can find that for you
07right
07so that doesn't fix it
DeathStar: Very true, very true. Should we stop?
Ninjazz|Depressed: not stop just space them out a bit
Ghosties: were you able to run Kotor before installing the mod?
DeathStar: Right. Let's just chill out for now and wait for the best moments.
HE"S FINE
whoops caps
lol
facepalm
why is the pig guy so bad at fighting?
04Yep, I was able to run the game perfectly
YAY!
/me gives Ghosties a congratualatory muffin
Ghosties: Okay, so it looks like compatibility mode is run for Steam itself, not the game
Hey DeathStar Don't you dare talk bad about Pey'j
Ghosties: So, exit steam, then right click on the steam icon
CrimsonPhoenix: oh ok sorry :'(
04Alright, and then?
and she put that thing where?
Cadelac.XD
in her computer
:O
-_-
It's Meanwhile again!
Ghosties: Select properties
dshannon: in her back pocket like a cartoon charictor
*but spelling
04Okay
Ghosties: There should be a Compatibility tab
wait wait wait....isn't that ff7 stuff there?
bbl. Got to get something to eat.
cya Ninjazz|Depressed
hmm... see, i have the problem of Kotor not running on my PC for some reason...
cya Ninjazz|Depressed
hmm, audio bug seems to have fixed itself
how's the sound btw?
DeathStar: hmm... nah... would rather hook up with you *winks*
Midnight_Tempest: oh you
04Alright, I'm in compatibility
DeathStar: cant blame a guy for trying...
Ghosties: In the tab or set in compatibility mode?
Midnight_Tempest: actually you can because he chose to try...but anyway...look a game
04In the tab?
huh, camera wont work there
DeathStar: ouch...
Ghosties: Okay. about a 3rd down the page there should be a check box
/me hugs Midnight_Tempest "you know your wubed"
04Run this program in compatibility mode for:?
Ghosties: yup. Click that and set the dropdown to windows XP
SP3 should be fine
04Hokay
okay. When you run it, it should run in XP compatibility mode
04Done
OMG stream? whose streaming?
04And that *should* work, yes?
hopefully
/me sighs
should i play the minigasme?
04Man, I hope so
minigame'
whose playing?
/me is
04I appreciate the help anyways, though
Ghosties: If the problem is in the mod itself this won't help, but if the problem is an old mod conflicting with a new OS this should do the trick
OMG Phase4 COOL did u get finally get permission from all mods?
well... hope you have some luck with that Ghosties...
hey, anytime
im off to bed now... night all
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: ^_^

hehehe
oooops....picture?
i think they ded
lol
They might be dead. :S
no fuses, works anyway
cant take picture of the robots
camera wont focus on them
02I have a question NS
02If your Bandwidth limit on a web server is 100000 MB, how many visitors can the website handle?
looks safe
sure does
depenz if they DDoS and hammer you
/me runs
that....might be problematic
100GB?
02yep
idk
it should be able to handle quite a bit
huh
yay
why is this?
'i'd say 33,333 browses? assuming 3MB per visit
of visiting and viewing a few pages
02I just was comparing free hosting to paid
02most free hosting is 100GB
well 100GB should be able to handle quite a lot of visitors
but free hosting is crap
why would you use it
<_<
>_>
Pigman is just trying to get eaten.
02you wouldn't XD
Metal Gear Jade
i use free hosting!
wordpress, etc
Finally!
02wordpress is free? 0_o
I thought I was alone......
/me hugs Twi_Fi
TAKE THAT RAT
:)
like so, www.junh1024.wordpress.com
02ah
Hehehe.
Srry, bout that, other stuff running around.
blog only, no complex stuff
lol, that 'huh' noise is a glitch
02"A wordpress test site"
02XD
Was that Pey'j?
it was test, until i started using it for updates
02it has a nice look to it
slow chat is slow
Daayuum, that was brutal.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
you have access to my webserver anyway
huh, he dropped his pa1
I don't see why you'd need free hosting
thats helpfull

Ghosties has the power though
Toasties
THE voice.
04That's it
O_O
Ghosties: can u kick my ghost?
That blood red text......
04I'm getting rid of Kotor, and everything with it
04No
04I'm not doing a fucking thing for anybody else right now
He has +m power!! and that would be good enough for me :D
righto
04I almost had my goddamn laptop fried tonight
/me pats Ghosties on the back
O.o
how come Ghosties
04I'm absolutely beyond pissed off right fucking now
0_o
/me cowers in a corner.
You're not supposed to play KOTOR on PC.. D:
04And not a single fucking soul responded to me in motherfucking Skype
I honestly almost know how you feel.
Ghosties: What did that game do to you to put you in such a mood? :(
04Was I yelling at a fucking brick wall or something?
04Huh?
Ghosties: Oh damn.... >.<
isnt 'hold position' and 'stay alert' what guads are suposed to do?
/me hugs Ghosties
04Jesus fuck
Listen to massive smile project Ghosties
impossible not to smile and be happy
:o
^
Ghosties: what happened?
^
You guys weren't here when Midnight and Ghosties tried to get Kotor working?
nope
At least I wasn't.
He's trying to get a mod working. So far, it's only been turning off his computer on initiation.
first i've heard of this Ninjazz|Depressed
04Is Kriel still here?
04I wanna chew his fucking head off
No, man. He left.
?
Ghosties...
O_o
Listen to Smile Smile Smile
?
And I guess good for him too...
shh Vordox
Why? Was his advice shit?
the hell did he do Ghosties
lol phase has no comment
Watch the Massive Smile Project PMV that BronyDanceParty made
04He told me to run the game in compatibility mode, and I almost lost my fucking hard drive because of him and his advice
impossible not to smile
04I am so goddamn pissed right now
Holy hell...
I'm sure he didn't mean no harm, man.
04I get that
04But it doesn't mean that I don't want to just wring his neck
Aye.
04AND WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE FUCKING MODS
04HUH
Sleeping, I guess.
/me is about ready to fucking kill somebody
kill all the rats
O_O
SuperBrony64|Zzz: is asleep
04I feel like motherfucking Val
04Ready to set someone on fucking fire
You can kick me if that helps! :)
o.o
Ninjazz|Depressed: NOOOOOOOOO
Did you lose anything Ghosties?
04I'm not sure yet
04My computer was very slow upon reboot
Do a scan and things. =/
04I don't have any virus protection though
Shit. Sounds more serrious than I thought.
ah, thats a shortcut
Least your OS wasent lost
Antivirus
Meant a scandisk
Who needs it?
Oh damn >.<
Ghosties: avast, its one of the best free ones
To check for damage
Aye. Checking for damage might be a good first step.
Indeed
04I don't know HOW to check
Ghosties: as for slowness, download process explorer, its a free thing from microsoft, much better than task manager
Ghosties, Press Window + R
it'll show you whats stealing cpu power
Ghosties: so what actually happened when you started the game with compatibility mode on?
Bah forgot the short command
Okay... Before we get Ghosties computer in deep shit again. Make sure you have Windows 7 before you start giving him advice and what not.
brb
04It ran for a bit and then system shut down again
You know, maybe that mod ain't worth it...
04So then I tried to boot the system again
o_o
04And then it shut down almost immediately
04So then I turned it on *again*
ah, that sounds like a detached cpu cooler
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/156571
04And then before I could read the safe text it shut down *a.g.a.i.n.*
it should shut itself down before it dies
04So at that particular point and time I'm freaking the fuck out
Vordox: its a hardware porblem
04Bells are going off in my head, "WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!!!!!"
Ghosties: How long was it cooled down to reset the FLASH mem?
lol
04I DON'T FUCKING KNOW
04I'M NOT COMPUTER SAVVY
04SAVVY?
Hmm
Okay dude.
05i say kill its power
You make angry situations humorous Ghosties.
04Well no shit
05open the case and see if its warm
Same wrek, cool it down.
Did this start after trying the mod to work?
04Do..what?
05note what parts are the warmest
^
04My entire computer is hot
04Well
04Not all of it
05yes but the source, need to find the source
04Only the left half is hot
04I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
04SPEAK ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER
05skype then?
:o
:O
04Listen to me
04Just
05nej utan från och med nu är tech suppor svensk
:O
04Just fucking listen
Dat english
Oh my.
but it seems so fun....
05deserved that
04Do not
04Fuck with me
04Right
04Now
04I swear to fucking god, I will ban your ass
04I have already lost my goddamn computer once
o_o
04I don't want to lose it again
05instead, do as I say. unplug any power if you havent. and open the case
04What are you talking about
05the lid on the side of your computer case
its a heat problem most likley
Doesn't he have a laptop?
04Yes, I'm using a laptop
^
05oh even better
05what brand?
04Gateway
hey im back , had a powercut for repairs on the complex earlier .... why are you in danger of loosing your rig ?
Somehow this song is fitting so well...
Ninjazz|Depressed: Musics in Beyond GOod and Evil <3
05do you know the exact model type?
Hey TrixieMuffin.
Hey Everypony
hey TrixieMuffin hows your day been
Vordox: It's great! :)
Hi Trixie.
hey Trixie hows your day been
Hello Trixie and TrixieMuffin.
Goood
05like "gateway super ninja turtle 5"
Ghosties: let it sit for ~20 minutes and then turn it on again
my day 's been cleany uppy because no power and nothing betterto do!
if it lasts longer your cooler has died
Oh, hello everypony. I'll only be on for a while.
04Will you all listen to me
Hey TheRainbowDash
05only if you listen to be ghosties
hey TheRainbowDash hows your day been
04I have run this computer multiple times for very long periods of time
Duck in cover, TheRainbowDash.
alexxm: Ah, going good, and you?
(ducks in cover)
04Not once has it EVER done anything like that, and it only does it when I install a mod on Kotor
Hey TheRainbowDash :)
i'm good TheRainbowDash
(ducks lazor)
victory
Trixie: shhh
Hello TheRainbowDash.
It was a memory leak then, that caused an overheating.
TheRainbowDash: shhhh
04And even the other times when I booted it back up after Kotor killed my laptop, it didn't fuck up anymore until I tried to run Kotor again
(is quiet)
04It's too coincidental
kotor?
04Way too coincidental
04It has to be the mod
04Has to be
04Only Kotor destroyed it
Do not uninstall Kotor yet
05did it run fine without the mod? then yes most likley the mod
04Yes, it ran just fine without them od
04*the mod
TheRainbowDash you said when you got back we will gonna have good hoof fun rember?
Ghosties no offense but how about not installing mods
Didn't it forced your computer to turn off? Must have caused some damage here and there.
Trixie: Oh, I remember...(winks*
04Trust me, I won't be installing mods for Kotor ever again
05you aint helping alexxm
(winks)
sorry Wrek
05ok now
/me bonks alexxm on the noggin
Let's all take a moment to breath here...
04I've even uninstalled the game from my computer
05we know that something probably overheated due to the behaviour
04If it overheated, it came from the processes of the mod
bye guys
bai alexxm
later alexxm
05or memory. anyways. was the crashign instant?
05like
05run the exe and boom
04No
05good
04I run the game, game loads, I play, two minutes later *system dead*
Wrek: tell me when you want to take over, i'll try get to the next save point
How do you mean "System dead"
04Like
04Dead
Shut down?
04Not "game crashes"
04Not even shut down
.....
O.o
05my best guess right now would be to let the laptp atleast reach room temperature
04I'm talking just "dead"
Frozen screen no more reaction ?
04No
04Dead
04As in
04The whole computer suddenly shuts off
04No shut down, no nothing
04Just off
Ah...
leeave it off for 20 min
if that doesnt work then its more serious
04...I'm not turning this off
04NOt right now
05dont set a time limit Phase4
......
Ghosties: You need to cool down the circuit.
05it needs to cool as low as possible
04I'm on my laptop right now, and it's fine
Or it'll most likely melt by now.
O.o
What are u guys talking about
i dont get the difference between shut down and shut off ?
Read ._.
SHUSH
Trixie: Circuitary damage
Trixie: Ghost got a mod for Kotor and it messed up his comp
04Listen, please, you're fucking scaring me right now
04My computer has never had this problem
04It only started with the mod
Calm down, Ghosties. Just calm down.
Ghosties: And that's why you should let it cool off. It's the faster and safer way.
04THEN STOP FUCKING TELLING ME MY GODDAMN COMPUTER IS GOING TO FUCKING MELT
it might just come with age
IT HASN'T MELTED YET.
04STOP
04FUCKING STOP
It's still functional, as you notice.
04I don't want to risk it
04Do you understand
04I'm scared
05ok so the laptop is currently on?
04Yes
05and its not acting up yet?
04No
05get rid of the mod asap, once it is gone. let your computer rest and cool down.
05no uneccesary risks you know
05and as in rest i dont mean just let it stand there, i mean beign completly off.
Ghosties: its not going to melt
05from what you have told me.
theres a tempreture sensor on the cpu
04I did, I got rid of the mod
05nice.
05now what I would do would be to turn off the laptop so that the extra heat caused by the mod is gone
05since it seems to be out of the danger zone, 10-20 minutes would suffice
05(danger zone as in not shutting down on you again)
04Wrek's what's an IFO file
05The IFO file type is primarily associated with 'DVD Info File'. An info file associated with a .VRO video file. The .VRO file contains the video stream and the .IFO file contains various scene and timing information. This is different from a .VOB file where that information is included in the file. Several manufacturers use .VRO/.IFO files. If present, the file VIDEO_TS.IFO consists of
5control and playback information for the entire DVD. VIDEO_TS.IFO is known as VMGI (The Video Manager Information file). This file is required to be present on a DVD-compliant disc.
04So then it's nothing dangerous?
05Other applications associated with file type IFO:
04Okay...alright
05its liek ESP for skyrim
05the general file format of the game engine
05oh right
04Wrek
04Listen to me
04I'm going to turn my computer off soon
04But
04I want you to be on skype
04Seriously
04Please
And we're back. Hope all goes well with the computer Ghosties.
more bugs!
i found another bug
Not good, XAX...
05ill be here and probably drawing
The parting of the red sea.
04I want you to keep looking at Skype
04Keep an eye out
04Look for me at abouut ten minutes after the hour
04*about
05aye
...
04But just keep an eye out constantly anyways, just in case
04You will be hearing from me soon...I hope
051 last thing
05naem of mod?

@Wrek Are doing this all by mouse?
Ninjazz|Depressed: I'm saying, its only as bad as you make it. And I don't think this is the place to debate my philosophies, and be corected under them.
Wrek: .. i guess you're comin to that..
ah
02:3
brb
(shrugs)
i have to do self defences
/me pokes
TheRainbowDash is a functional member of society, she works hard to keep the Factory running. You should give her more respect.
12:3
She has to give me respect
She makes ponies otu of rainbows!
Om: Never said anything about discussing your philosophies, only asking what you were talking about. And on that note, you are correct.
Trixie ask applebloom for self defense
when they fail they test they get made into rainbows!! wat?
G2g
/me pokes

Me too
Ninjazz|Depressed: Creepypasta?
Well, sleeping was my cure for Caramel's trolling with strobing Zalgo Scootaloo
CrazyCherry: No doubt it will fix all my problems... But i just cant. :(
Twi_Fi: Hell no!
I already changed it
/me sighs

lol parents
don't worry drf
my parents do that too
-_-
I know I've complained about Denmark always being gloomy, but now that it's not, I think I preferred it otherwise.
but you're asian
that's expected
CrazyCherry im respecting his authority :P
Kammerjunk: Funny how that works eh?
The mods are sleeping, POST HUMANS!!!
Indeed.
oh thanks
Jk.
02http://us3.memecdn.com/son-i-am-dissapoint_o_209646.jpg
02there you are
/me hides
CrazyCherry: You better have been.
I'll go find that Pinkie Pie Just Kidding picture.
Oh, and have any of you ever heard of Persona?
Humans.....ugh.
Oh wait, I just ruined the joke.
/me sighs
indeed
hmmm.... i wonder how spitfire go that necklace...
I have heard of the games.
Twi_Fi: I like humen. But they have no manners.
02but really, most parents think their kids are worthless
I know
Persona? Yes. I have.
02I just deal with it
Oh, they're not all bad.
my parents know it
:/
Om: I herd u like GilDash.
lol
Ninjazz|Depressed: I found a copy of Persona 4. Why can't I stop playing it.
CrazyCherry: You heard wrong.
Kammerjunk: I've heard good things.
Reddit or 9GAG?
Om: I herd you hate me.
05memebase
^
I use neither.
Memes are too mainstream for me.
I just found Army of Mushrooms on Youtube. I am happy.
02they should be happy over the fact that you're in uni
02A lot of kids don't even get that far
Wow the stream's behind...
What about 4Chan?
CrazyCherry: You aint on any faveorites list.
tell them that, not me x.x
4chan is just boring.
05stoppped goign to 4chan after ponis
^ its weird now
Never been to that hellscape.
good
Eh. How bad can it be?
You're not worthless
Ninjazz|Depressed: These days? Not very.
go to the pony section they have and see for yourself
Were they much worse?
02shhhh
02he can't know that >:/
close to it though
remember last week's festivities? :/
I do try not to, hate, anything. Love and tollerance and all that jazz.
I bet you won't even find a thread about the show
its just all pony porn...
Memebase is decent enough.
You... did.. not.. just...
I just realised my computer volume was down... I wondered for a while why i didn't hear anything....
You... I'm cool with that.
Carry along. :)
02ヽ（´ー｀）
Tally on.
/me glomps Om
Same difference.
not helping
Quite.
Shinkenga!
Was that REALLY necisary?
Is it ever?
Glomping is too mainstream.
02what happened last week?
Om: Yesh.
/me nuzzles Om.
/me sigh -_-
Daayuum, Om.
You get all the mares. :D
Should have stay quiet...
Or whatever.
I wonder how the wonderbolts get into their suits...
Ninjazz|Depressed: Yes, "whatever"
Ninjazz|Depressed: I'm just teasing him...:)
/me snortsnort.
but they aint unicorns...
YouTube -is- too mainstream. Google Videos is where it's at.
CrazyCherry: You like to see him squirm, don't you? :$
02XD
Kammerjunk: Shut up :|
I'm sorry D:
except how to be a happy Windows user
but seriously
Ninjazz|Depressed: Yesh! :D
Its worse when you know you're just a tool for anothers amusement.
But what did I do? ._.
Ninjazz if your depressed you should take a visit to my moms work
Kammerjunk: You made Youtube Look bad.
Oh, you know deep down that they really do love you somewher in their toying ways.
At first, that voice made me think of Miracle of Sound for some reason.
/me hugs Kammerjunk.
Ninjazz i don't know she works and does some mental health shit
?
Seems legit.
/me hugs CrazyCherry back.
Hey
I don't mind windows /that/ much
I just prefer linux
Twi_Fi: I know.
Ninjazz|Depressed: I sure hope not, then they have more emotional compultion to do it further...
she tells me she works with "Depressed people" or something
that's what I mean
but anyway
Om: Well, there has to be a reason... Right.
If you go you get a free stress ball :$
/me nuzzles Ninjazz|Depressed so he wouldn't be depressed anymore.
but the stress ball....
As tempted as I am to remove |Depressed from my name, I sadly can't. That would be lying. :(
I have a pair of stress balls that you twist around each other in your hand. It's relaxing as hay.
hay
Ninjazz|Depressed: I'm sure they have their reasons... And now you have me thinking about what is worse...
Yup.
lolwut?
I use windows
for gaming
what have i done...
Om: What is worse?...
btw, this music pleases me.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Give me an hour and I may come to a thesis.
Thank you anyway, CrazyCherry. I do apprecaite the help though. :)
As much as I like the electronic genres, I really prefer old rock.
play frank sinatra
Frank Sinatra is awesome.
Om: I'll give you 10 minutes.
yup
w/e
I was talking about what happened last week
Angry mushrooms are angry.
hmmm
<----13 and likes Frank Sinatra
02lol
02what happened last week?
05implying i take requests
02is it really that bad?
I <3 this music.
If you don't like it, mute the stream and listen to your own stuff.
I did it. I found the one video that made me truly cry.
Frank Sinatra, Cole Porter, Taco... They're all good.
k
well it really got to me
A taco?
No, Taco. He's the one who made Puttin' on the Ritz.
Litwick: Friday? Friday? Gotta break down on Friday? :'(
Oh, I know that song!
No, it's not Friday. It's a pony related video and boy does it hit HARD.
disconnected again... *SIGH!!!!*
Taling about Kammerjunk 's song not Ninjazz|Depressed 's.
*talking

Keyboard, why you fail me!
Keyboards are such silly fillies.
Litwick: Lighthearted or opposite?

Dken2021: Well, I failed spanish, bod mood that only got worse as the day went by and I haven't sleeped in 48 hours. Today sucked.
Icy: That sucks.
would that be a good thing Icy?
Icy: I know that feel.
Icy: Neither do my friends. One of 'em laughs when he sees that the house songs I've been listening to were by bronies, but I don't mind.
oh my Ninjazz, hope things get better for ya soon
'S all in good fun.
I'm not sure is that good thing or bad... i have kinda bad feeling right now :l
Dken2021: I'm sure they will. Thanks. :)
^-^

05i love the end solo on this one
Om: You're really asking for the impossible you know.
02no one has any reasons to hate their life
No Ninjazz|Depressed they could be me, tis the best you can get.
Om: Hey, you ain't depressed. :|
And that's how great I am.
Om: You need to be about 20% cooler.
The really bat thing in this mess is, that i have youtube channel... i have some music and stuff in there... i denied that im brony for few times :'( and now i feel bad about that
Kammerjunk: Numbers would cramp my style. I use quirks

Frozen!
That's about it.

Ninjazz|Depressed: Raid the cuboards! :D

WHY IS THERE BAILEY'S ON EQD? :D
Hi Bonsi.
Bonsi: Holla! :)
Because EQD is silly.
hello Bonsi
Aye, I guess that's true, GilDash|BLT. I'll just go take a peek.
I think I need to drink more water.
BRB, breading EqD. :D

Why would I bread EqD? :D
Also, Bailey is a pretty good liquor.
im starting to get a little pissed of with all these disconnects....

Kammerjunk: Aye, it is. Just suprised to see it is all. :D
I mix Bailey in my coffee to seem sophisticated.

Kammerjunk: I drink it STRAIGHT! :D

Meh. I'm more a Tullamore Dew person.
oh nvm
I think I spot half a crazy Sparkle.
i need sum coffee
God, Chrome is so much easier to work with than Opera. :D
I have one of those Dolce Gusto machines, but I haven't used it lately. Tea is just too good to pass.
Coffee would be nice right about now...
05much better
Eh, I don't like hot drinks too much.
Anyways, I return with cereal.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Is it oatmeal?
All I could find.

GilDash|BLT: :D
I really need to find that Nintendo DS. I have two of them lying around the house, but I don't know WHERE.

that reminds me, my uncle got a coffee brewer, but haven't got stuff to make stuff with it
I also have a PS2 and a Wii, I think.
Can I have it? I'll put it to good use.
The thing is, I don't know -where-. I have a walk-in closet full of random stuff.
Kammerjunk: I have all of them too, but my DSs top has one of the connectors snapped, and my PS2 won't accept any controllers. :D
Dat Care Bares :S
Internet at school died
so evil
if you're perpared to venture to the deep south Ninjazz|Depressed, you can
Kammerjunk: just download emulator
I did for my PS2.
That's how I play Persona 4.
Dken2021: I'm not prepared...

Good idea.

Must resist urge to get some...
You should totally get some coffee, Ninjazz|Depressed.
I don't drink coffee
http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5787284

Ninjazz|Depressed: not going into detail!
Airpuff: Knowing you, you will...
Airpuff: We'll find out when we're kicked. :D
If you reach that point you have gone to far.

Or Jiu-Jitsu. Either or.
Ninjazz|Depressed: GO TO FUCKING SLEEP ALREADY! :D
Airpuff: What could I do...? ;)
GilDash|BLT: *waves hooves around in air*
Wave your hooves around in the air.
GilDash|BLT: ... ... http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg

I'm careful when I do so, Om.

I dunno
Ninjazz|Depressed: I'm going to keep up until you do. :) I'm freshly rested, and it feels so wonderful. :)
Shaddap, GilDash|BLT. :(
05the suit that is

Ninjazz|Depressed: Hush now, quiet now, it's time to go to bed. :)
Ninjazz|Depressed: Might you enjoy Sweetie Belle's version better? xD
*falls asleep*

Ninjazz|Depressed: Hey, you should sleep.
Airpuff: Actually yes I would. ;)
Ninjazz|Depressed: xD
Even Om...
Ninjazz|Depressed: Go to bread.

Ninjazz|Depressed: Is that suppriseing?
Ave, Lil_B.
Lil_B: go to bed? o.o
Om: Just a tad.
yaplap's version would be best.
And hello Lil_B.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Fine then, stay up and rot your brain
Airpuff no, or i can't sleep at night XD
Lil_B: ooh its the middle of the day? >.<
Staying up is not good for you. Ive done it many times and I spent half year being miserable.
Airpuff yes, i just came back from School XD, its 4pm here
Ditto.
I'm tired anyway.
>English teacher from last semester using an iPad in student lounge
Dammit, GilDash|BLT. Look at what you've made the chat become.
Giger4444: no way, i've been sleeping 4 hours a night for half a year and i feel great! xD
Ninjazz|Depressed: Go to bed, go to bed, go to bed! Go to bed, go to bed, go to beeeeeeeed!
Its 7am here woOOoooOO
/me sighs
Very well.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Good. :)
Ninjazz|Depressed: its up to you xD
Actually, it is possible to go with sleeping 20 minutes every 4 hours, but it's not a good idea.
Ninjazz|Depressed: It's not like we're going to disappear. :D
...
says u
Kammerjunk: I know, and it's 15 minutes.
I might.
Ninjazz|Depressed: you can change your nick to stay up further ;)
xD
Airpuff: yet... :) Last semester there were many occasions when I slept about 12 hours per week, many times I've been up for 2-2 and a half days straight
Close enough.
Eh.
Giger4444: same here xD
Airpuff: This semester my productivity just flatlined
My bed is looking really comfy all the sudden.
Kammerjuk its also possible to just sleep between 4-5 hours a day... but nobody will make me do it
I guess it won't hurt.
Giger4444: not mine =S Guess thats the diffrence xD
Why is no one sleeping and then complaing about how crap they feel? :D
Lil_B: The thing is that you don't go into REM instantly.
Airpuff: I envy you :D
Giger4444: all my friends say the same xD
*gives Ninjazz|Depressed a fluttershy to sing him to sleep*
Can I keep her?
my douchebag roommmates prevent me from sleeping
Anyways.
Gives Ninjazz|Depressed a cup of black coffee.. xD
I slept good, and I'll do it again
You win, GilDash|BLT.
Ninjazz|Depressed: HELL NO!
Ninjazz|Depressed, how long have you been up for?
LOL, Skydroid, apparently Bill Nye will be visiting Ohio State University tonight
last night one of those idiots was watching a movie and eating popcorn from a loud bag last night
/me hugs Ninjazz|Depressed.
Dken2021: Almost 48hrs.
Ninjazz|Depressed: Night night. :)
in the bedroom
Night.
/me hugs Ninjazz|Depressed Good night then ^^
twilight_sprinkler: you live in a dorm?
night man
good lord man, get some rest
twilight_sprinkler: :D
Sweet dreams, Ninjazz|Depressed.
twilight_sprinkler: That's why you need to get back at them.
Giger4444: yep
nighty Ninjazz|Depressed, hope you feel better soon
twilight_sprinkler: Put HCl in their food.
Did all of ou made a Competition about staying awake?
Kammerjunk: theyre assholes, we dont talk to each other at all, its not a friendly atmosphere
Stop talking to Ninjazz, or he wont leave!
Goodnight Ninjazz|Depressed, may you no longer be depressed.
Lil_B: i guess its a natural instinct xD
twilight_sprinkler: that sucks. I couldnt live like that. After a while decided to get a job and rent an apartment :)
05wait
Kammerjunk: and its not that theres hate as far as i can tell, just very self-absorbed people
05here's a song that will make this image worse
this song is weasome
... as ong?
a song*
I've done 48 hours before. I was convinced everything was moving out of the corners of my eye. :D
twilight_sprinkler: Well, put HCl in their food anyway.
the pretender remix
Lol GilDash|BLT xDD
awww
Kammerjunk: lol
...
GilDash: for me it felt like I was tipsy. Euphoric as hell.
Kammerjunk: whatll that do
Airpuff i just find it strange that it doesn't matter when i go on, there are always the same people on XD ike they NEVER sleep XD
I think the logest I stayed up was 28 hours
*longest
I can sleep in almost any position, so I havent ever stayed up longer than 25 hours.
Apparently this is my theme song here. :D
Lil_B: xDD Ofc.
Giger4444: i wont be living in a dorm next term either, this term i had no choice, its the rules
Om awww
Omm lucky u
Giger4444: I wanted to kill everything that talked to me. :)
twilight_sprinkler: Ooh! Or I know! Get two vials and fill one with HCl and the other with ammonia. Then put the two vials over a door and when they open, the vials will crash to the ground and mixm, creating a toxic gas.
Lil_B: I sleep a regurarly 4 hours a week on normal weekdays and like 6 hours in the weekends xD
twilight_sprinkler ah, freshman?
Dken2021: yeah
mix*
I hate freshman rules
Airpudd :D nice i got 5 hours last night
/me yawns
Kammerjunk: lol dem chemical weapons. makes me wish i knew chemistry :P
DaringDude: Aye, slept though minor earthquakes, fire alarms and rock bands alike
I got 6.
Airpuffs ~5in the week ~8-10at weekends XD
DaringDude: thats alot o.o
This song is not helping my feelings for Spitfire over there. =_=
they try to make you more social with everyone, even if you don't want to
Good afternoon everypony
hai Nerom
eh. I managed to sleep my full 8 hours on weekdays due to sleeping early.
Lil_B: i hate when i forget the time though.. and i get like 2 and a half hour of sleep. xD
twilight_sprinkler: They're not even that hard to get. HCl is a swimming-pool chemical and ammonia, you can probably get in a grocery store.
Nerom: Holla! :)
lol Om yeah i am a pretty heavy sleeper as well im sleep like a log at times
Hello Nerom.
Dken2021: not the freshmen i live with, minus one of them. and i dont like to be social either
morning, everypony!
>this song
So yea, I'm just listening to the stream...what in the world are we listening to now? ^^;
>on a my little pony fan site
seems logical
Hello Sylandest.
Dken2021: that one minus however is extremely in social in our room tho
morning, Twi_Fi! :)
/me glomps Phase-4 no good reason
thats not very effective, it wold produce mostly ammonium-chloride
morning Sylandest
/me hugs DaringDude back
morning, Dken2021! :) how are you today?
:)
Lil_B: xD
not to mention that you would need about -20°C to liquidify ammonia
The chat is picking up.
alright Sylandest, and you?
Lil_B: I think ima ... I'll try get some more sleep as i move out.. but not before i move out.. it feels like im loosing so much time when i do xD
Wrek: Okei... Band name and song Now pleaaase?! xD
Now you've all mesured up with your sleepign hours, how many of you have done it *without* caffeine? :)
Dken2021: good, letting my laptop download World of Warcraft at the moment
suit tries?
Giger4444: Doesn't it freeze at -77.7 C?
GilDash|BLT: only a few hours a best, lol
GilDash|BLT: I don't drink caffine.
But yeah, I made a mistake when I said "liquid".
I don't drink Coffee and rarely Cola
GilDash|BLT: Me i dont drink coffee that much raelly xD
me neither
Energy drinks count guys! :D
GilDash|BLT: Tea is the ultimate... coffee.... xD
Yes, but it stays in gaseous form till -20
GilDash|BLT: No energydrink either.. =s
never had an energy drink...
Right-o.
I'm crazy, I don't do Drugs i don't drink Alkohol, I don't Smoke I don't drink Coffee...
I seriously know someone who was convinced that energy drinks had no caffeine in them until I pointed it out. =_(\
-_-
GilDash|BLT: xD
wat
this chat needs more ponies http://mlfw.info/f/1535/
he mustve thought it was homeopathic :D
Lil_B: me neither if u dont count as trying any of those as actually doing them
Energy drinks have about 4 different types of caffine
and sugar. thats the other kicker.
~Ariels in the sky / When you you lose small mind you free out lives~
>hot girl walks up and sits next to me on couch
And tourine. :D
>acts like I don't exist
:<
I hate energy drinks
latte or tea for me
Meh, they taste like crap. Good for Jagerbombs though. :D
Anything with an "ene" sound at the end, is a type of caffine.

I hate doing this, but I must, goodnight everypony!

Airpuff: No, that's me. And who uses spoons anyhow; tip it in from the container! :D
ROAR
Am I the only one who dont put ANY sugar/sweetener in tea/coffee?
Monster Rehab. It's a non-carbonated energy drink made from tea and lemonade. It doesn't taste like an energy drink, and on top of that it's only 20 calories for a whole can.
061 = 10%
061 is lowest 030
oh ok
GilDash|BLT: Omg ._.
I'll be back in 5-10 minutes

GilDash|BLT: Talk about ruining a good cup of tea -.-
like our system just we are 1-6, 6 being the highest x3
OtakuTom: A healthy energy drink? I don't believe it.
The Problem is that I'm currently in an apprentenceship in chemestry, but In germany... i would so like to explain some things right now, but my vocabulary is so limited in the technical part XD
02then how is a 9 a bad thing?
Airpuff: What? There's only so much that tea can be saturated by at any time. :)
02XD
/me glares at GilDash|BLT
06it was DA/TST related
there is a saturation limit
You drink sugar GilDash|BLT
06teacher told it to class
Yeah Om, GilDash|BLT just put sugar in hot water xD

Airpuff: My physics teacher said so, and he's fucking awesome, so fuck you. :p

GilDash|BLT: Idc then your physics teacher is dumb! xD

Airpuff: For the record, I don't drink tea anyway. :)

06but i still got a 9 for a hard project :3
Lil_B: .... water... that works too

I prefer chocolate milk over... well, pretty much everything.
06oh, and in pghysics class
I have to have water filtered.
06everyone got their grades back
Squash and water for me. 'Cause the water's so damned hard around here it tastes like crap.
Malavolent: well.. chocolate milk is cursed.. your glass is always empty xDD
062.3.....5......4.5....
06my turn
068.2
06O.o
Squash?
Airpuff: Story of my life.
xD
Om: Ah-ha.
I drink tap water but I always de-carbonate it first.
breaking benjamin
DaringDude: Where?!
I didn't think that was a drink.
this reminds me of them to an extent
DaringDude: i highy approve.
Om: You know, fruit flavoured stuff that you mix with water.
Airpuff Water does so many good things to your body XD just imagine all the Calorines it has to burn to bring it to the right temperature when its cold
some friends know about my internet shenanigans
they tease me about it like I tease them about theirs
it's fun
well im off to school bye everypony
Om: As opposed to juice, which is orange juice and the like.
GilDash|BLT: That is what they call it?
02in Physics I tend to get Bs
Lil_B: xDD Yeah its fantastic xD
06i know
laters, DaringDude
but then again >friends
Om: That's what we in Enland call it. What do you call it?
06they be arse, i be arse back
bye daring dude
/me wubs all da ponies :P

06some people, eh? :P
GilDash|BLT: Flavored water >.>
Bai DaringDude
I've said it before I feel like an alien in my class
Lil_B: So... basically, if I drink a lot of cold water, my body will burn fats to make it warm?
02hurr
Om you didnt find out before now? xD
Om: Yeah, but it's not flavoured water. It's squash. :D
Airpuff: I'm a recluse.
So, how's everybody?
Malavolent: It has to so something to restore the temperatire loss.
durr
GilDash|BLT: Say what... you're talking about.... pure squash? GilDash|BLT ? xD
rawr
etc
GilDash|BLT: I have eaten squash, it tastes nothing like water
!pokemon
Espeon, you are a 13Corsola.
I'm good, Dermathil, how about you?
No
Yeah, it makes sense.
06brb, getting a new USB
I'm okay
I am going to find images with a smile on my face before I loose it. :)
Malavolent yes, but not much
I am going to ignore that spelling mistake too. :)
GilDash|BLT: Stop being confuseing.
GilDash|BLT: say wuut? xD
Lil_B: Well, then I need to drink gallons of water :D
Om I think GilDash|BLT Loves Discombobulating ya xD
And if I survive that (and I probably won't), I'll be skinny!
If you eat lots of icecream your body will burn fat to heat it up too.
Malavolent: be careful not to do too much at once
Here. Fruit squash: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(drink) :)
I think there is too much broscience here now :)
Honestly. :D
Malavolent IF YOU WANT TO BURN CALORINES LIKE THAT IT#S MORE EFFECTIVE TO HUG AN ICEBLOCK
TrixieMuffin: I can't eat ice cream...:(
Airpuff: I noticed, your no better in my opinion
Malavolent sorry for caps
Om: I never claimed that ;)
Malavolent: Or you could walk an hour a day. That's good exercise. :)
Lil_B: Oh my god... Roadtrip to Antarctica?
GilDash|BLT: I'Ve walked 3 hours or so today, don't worry. :)
GilDash|BLT: ... Physical movement?.. EEEW xD
Walking is good indeed. I tried running but my knee cant stand it...
I prefer sitting.
But walking works..
xD
GilDash|BLT Blasphemy. Muscles is only more weight on your body
Airpuff: Hey, for my old job I used to walk 5 miles everyday. :)
Lil_B: You cant say that, depends wether or not you are fat. xD
GilDash|BLT: That must be unpleasant in hot temperatures.
Airpuff: oh come now, its not so bad...*looks to see he has to go to kitchen to get a drink* ...I won't make it...
Airpuff: 2.5 miles of a 13 mile journey, then back again. :D
Shesh GilDash|BLT ..
Malavolent: It's unpleasant in cold temperatures. I get abnormally warm from exercise. :(
Sylandest: Wat? xD
Airpuff: I was making a joke about physical movement and being lazy...lol
Sylandest: sorry to lazy to understand it xD
GilDash|BLT: Following that logic, it must be worse in summer, isn't that correct?
Airpuff: I rest my case :D lol
Ahaha
My internet froze with TLT's remix of the Smile Song. No complaints there.
bachelor lifestyle rules: if its out of reach it could be at the other side of the earth as well.
Malavolent: Yes. And today the temperature is over 10 C. Which means I struggle. :D
Litwick: seems legit
Giger4444: good rule to live by
There's blood on my hand, I wonder how that got there...
GilDash|BLT: xD You use a bike i hopee?
GilDash|BLT: You're not from US, are you?
Om: :O
I tryed not eating . Went 5 days on water alone , then i got bored , didnt exercise or anything though!
If I am not moving in a room I want no more than 18 C. If I am moving, fridge temperaturs please. :)
>got bored
05this sogn is so random
GilDash|BLT: xDDD
GilDash|BLT: so following that, does that mean you like the winter?
Lil_B: Its not.
Airpuff: No. I walk the whole thing. Bikes are too much of a hassle.
GilDash|BLT: .. seriously.. bikes are to much of a hassle? xD
Stream is a bit behind. it's actually funny :D
GilDash then I presume you live in a large city?
Sylandest: Very much so. Snow makes it inconvenient to drive though. :(
Airpuff: Blasphomy!
Airpuff: I lived in Yorkshire. Everything was on a hill which meant STAIRS everywhere. :D
Back in a sec. ;)
02!Pokemo
02!Pokemon
BlueFlare, you are a 5Aggron.
"Stairs! Stairs Everywhere!"
02!Pokemon
GilDash|BLT: ..Stairs?... meh
02!Pokemon
BlueFlare, you are a 7Bonsly.
02also
02hai Espeon~
Airpuff: I hate stairs..my entire college campus is a hill...lol
I like rideing bikes >_>
GilDash|BLT: I mean.. avrage cycling speed compared to walking is redicolus.. its like 5-10 times faster.. xD
GilDash|BLT: Juuuust so ya know.
x)
Winter , or rain , preferably at night , thats when i can stand to be outside . As long as i dont see too many people around , people just ruin it for me!
one of the unis im applying to is at the top of a massive hill
Unless you bike at 30mph downhill
lol im at school and using this epic win school didn't block it
... Wrek the fuck is this song? xD
TrixieMuffin gun solves Problem
Airpuff: Irrelevant. I'm still waiting for trains too, and my walking speed is 5-7 miles an hour.
Lil_B: Gun doesn't make it rain, silly.
GilDash|BLT: Still it is faster.. xD
Airpuff: 'Sides, why waste money on a bike when I can *run*? :D
GilDash|BLT: Beacuse its faster -.
Malavolent depends on how big they are
Runing is hard.
Airpuff: Yeah, but I've got the times between two trains to wait for too. So it really doesn't matter at all.
Lil_B: I like where this is going.
Om: Running is easy. :)
oo
GilDash|BLT: I guess you're right if you're raking trains xD
GilDash|BLT: it hurts my soul!
Airpuff: FUCKING TRAINS! :D
GilDash|BLT: "I LIKE TRAINS!"
Airpuff: They're NEVER on time. :D
GilDash|BLT: You should try the busses where i live..
Damn, I wan't to ride train to my school, or everywhere else.
And they are filthy and smelly
Om: It hurts my shoe soles, but that's about it. :D
GilDash|BLT: Its like.. the first one doesent show up... neither does the second one.. and after 45 minutes three coems in a row?... the fuck..
GilDash|BLT: Heathen!
Airpuff: No, you should try the buses where I live now. :D
Malavolent China had a problem with a giant Snowfall, because they tried to let the snow fall controlled by shooting the clouds... normaly that actually works and China isn't the only country doing that
rammstein?
Airpuff: Same. Only we're on a half hour schedule, so miss one and you've waited an hour. -_-
Giger4444: nope this is either nowegian or sweedish
Lil_B: They shoot the clouds and the snow begins to fall? How does that even work?
GilDash|BLT: xD
Id like to have an umbrella that makes it start to rain whenever i open it! speaking of wich , i still havent gotten myself an Umbrella Corp. umbrella, and i want one !
GilDash|BLT: And they are always Stuffed with people too i guess? -.-
This sounds like someone is screaming the final countdown
Om its a sweedish metal band for what i understand.. of what they are.. "singing" xD
Airpuff: The last time I was on one there was some fat guy who smelt of death. I considered just hopping off and waiting for the next one. :D
Malavolent they also can do it with rain, so it doesn't grow into a giant storm. I don't know... they just kinda activate them i think :/
Airpuff: Ah.
This sounds like a guy who is trying to pass a kidney stone.
GilDash|BLT: Know that feel >.>
Lil_B: Damn Chinese, cheating mother nature.
GilDash|BLT: There's alwaus this woman with her walker.. and she starts crying each time she gets on in fear of the bussdriver starting to drive before she has sat down -.-
Airpuff: FFS, right. :D
Let er fall!
GilDash|BLT: thus it always takes like 5 minutes for her to get on ._.
GilDash|BLT: ALWAYS!
You "seed" the clouds with small particles , so the watervapor can condense onto them and form droplets or snowflakes depending on temperature , thus controlling where and when it rains instead of having to wait for critical mass!
Airpuff make some noises when she enters to let her think he hes about to drive XD
Airpuff, GilDash|BLT: I'm glad I don't live wherever you two live.
Airpuff: We never had any regulars when I used it. There was always *one* of them anyway. :D
Lil_B: Seriously man.. i dont wanna stay on that stuffed bus longer than i have too.. plus then i would have to call the ambulance -.-
!pokemon
Espeon, you are a Tyrogue.
Airpuff i can releate to that :/
!eonget
4Espeon just got a male 6Espeon
GilDash|BLT: Well this damn woman ALWAYS gets on in rushour... xD
Rush*
Im off to cook some dinner. Bye all!
DAT raubtier nice Wrek :D
cloning.mkv
Rushour are good movies
Airpuff: Well, that's still foreign. :D
/me is not racist at all.
GilDash|BLT: There's a reason i understand the sweedish lyrics of this song xD
.. Somehow.. they dont make that much sense.. xD
Airpuff: It has lyrics?
GilDash|BLT: Oh, poor you. There is always cold weather in England, isn't it?
Om eeyup ... somehow -.-
Airpuff: I think you're lieing.
Malavolent: Try norway xD
Malavolent: colder here xD
Airpuff: But you're vikings and stuff, a small winter can't be that much of a problem to you.
What is this one saying.
Malavolent: It's alaways nice to exit the door in the morning in - 30 Celcius -.-
Malavolent: Well, not cold per se, we just complain about it more. :D
Malavolent: well i guess.. i never close my jacket unless it is - 20 or lower
GilDash|BLT: That actually makes sense.
Airpuff: I'd love to live somewhere as cold as that. :)
Airpuff true Scandinavians Heat themselfes up on an ice block!
Airpuff: I guess you get used to cold temperatures.
GilDash|BLT: ... well its not that good xD
From that viewpoint, mine country is the worst.
02!Pokemon
BlueFlare, you are a 3Sceptile.
Malavolent: Yeah i guess...
02bbl
Airpuff: I can go in a storm at -14 C during gale force winds with a t-shirt and be fucking WARM. How does that work? :D
GilDash|BLT: Donno -.- same as me..
Airpuff: Soaked to the skin too. :D
GilDash|BLT: Maybe not that bad.. xD
GilDash|BLT: Still -14 is normal here..
At winter ofc.
/me dries his mane while he's coming out from the shower..."oh, Hello everypony! how's your day been?"
Wrek: Why does Spitfire have that green sparkle in her eye?
/me mutes Stream, puts o some C64
"me stares at Magical_pablez94 YOU ARE NUDE!
Coldest weather I was in was...In celcius would be eh...
Airpuff: Yeah, I'm mad. When I did kettlebelling in Yorkshire before I moved, during winter I would steam like a mofo. Like, you could *see* the steam pouring off of me.
Airpuff: Like a fucking kettle. :D
GilDash|BLT: Hate that T.T
GilDash|BLT: Happens to me when i take of my jacket xD Looks like a bloody superhero of sorts xD
/me "i know Airpuff ... hope i didn't shocked ya...:)"
Magical_pablez94: Ofc i dont mind ;)
xD
.. Seriously.. these lyrics xD
05fuckign wings
Wrek: Tell me about it.. working on my RD .. its a fucking pain xD
In celcius the coldest weather I have been in would be I think -70ish
They have deep meaning, don't they?
-70.. what? xD
celcius?....
Malavolent: super deep...
xD
/me keeps dring his mane and sits down "uff..."
Well it was -46 degreese F
Simple math in the mornin hurts my head -_-
Google is useful...
i love having showers...:)
how was the Formula for F in C again ... i forgot
Magical_pablez94: Would you like me to towel you off? ;)
I tried googling how many Celsius is -46 Farenheit.
Well 0 C is 32 F
It is 229 Kelvin.
Wrek: Hard to make detailed wings with ponies huh? When there bodies are generally supposed to be smooth.
interesting wings
GilDash|BLT: and here I thought it was going to be a quiet morning...lol
-43 Celcius Om xD
Malavolent: I can work with Kelvin. :)
Farenheits is a silly thing
Malavolent, good to know
Airpuff: Math is hard
0 c is 273 k i think
Sylandest: Goddesses forbid it! :D
-43 °C is more realistuic XD
Yep.
GilDash|BLT: haha! :D
celcius and kelvin are the same thing with different zeros
Om: Depends, you do alot of assigments?
Phase4: I know. :)
/me raises his front hooves letting GilDash|BLT do what she wants to do
0 K is –273,15°C if I recall correctly.
Om: if you work alot it gets easy.. somehow xD
Phase4 273,15 but don't want to be nitpickly here
Malavolent: seems right
/me towels off Magical_pablez94, humming as she does so.
Airpuff: Oh yes SOMEHOW
Om: don ask me.. im not good at maths anyways xD
Lil_B, :|
Airpuff: I remember it begins at absolute zero temperature and goes up.
Anywayss!! Dinner brb peeps xD
I'mm be back in a sec. ;)
Malavolent: yep
GilDash|Laundry: take your time
Malavolent: thats right
Anways dinner
Om: ;)
brb
Phase4 sorry :(
I feel clever now.
Yay.
/me hugs Lil_B
/me claps for Malavolent
/me golf clap for Malavolent
/me hugs Phase4 back
Dohoho ninja cameo on stream!
Oh stop it, you!
mwahaha
/me continues claping
Om: You're embarrasing me :$
/me smiles at GilDash|Laundry humming
"Skate.or.die...skate or die... skate or die.. die dddiediedie...
/me debates if he should clap more
Anyone else finds themselves turning heads as Wrek turns the picture?
Be back soon, everypony, gonna step out to buy something I need
Sadly, I can't turn my head 360 degrees.
No, that would be silly
05hows that?
I think the size is right.
looks better then mine
05color contra faic?
Airpuff: btw i'm a pony so i'm almost always naked :D
It looks really good. Oh and you moved the shadow good
Wrek: I love yhe shading, the colors all seem perfect. But doesnt she have hilights going all the way through her tail?
Magical_pablez94: Yes you are.
Om: ok?
Magical_pablez94: Okay indeed.
I never know how to draw wings...
I can't draw for shit. :D
GilDash|Laundry: Neither can I, but I'm learning.
GilDash|Laundry: That is because shit don't need anything drawn for it
Malavolent: Well, I'm not doing that either. :p
Om: :|
/me noogies Om.
/me is unsure if noogie is better or worse than hug/glomps e_e
Om: it's incredible how pegasus wings are similar to human hands... just give a look at arts and u'll notice that.... five feathres attached to a rigid part...
/me brushes Om's mane.
GilDash|EqD: I'd like to draw something beatiful. Long way to go.
Om: Brushie, brushie, burishe... :)
Om: and the middle one is even the longest...
Malavolent: I'd like to draw something that looks like something. :D
Magical_pablez94: I have disected a chickens wing befiore
I'm staying in the chat, but I'm currently searching for some ZX Spectrum Art, to get all the colours
Om: *poker face* i eated one :D
GilDash|EqD: Yeah, that's a good achievement too.
/me curses brushies
Malavolent: :D
Malavolent: I'd like to draw my OC. :D
05the way i draw hair eliminates the highlights
Wrek: hmmmm.....Then superb.
I only draw in pencil sooo...I cant do what wrek does anyway
GilDash|EqD: yeah me too... i'd like to have different hands so that they'll do what i say them...:D
GilDash|EqD: I wonder why I don't have my OC yet.
Magical_pablez94: I'd like to have a different brain so I can think straight. :D
Malavolent: You and me both.
Malavolent: I have an OC but no damned colour scheme. :D
Om: I personally dislike OC ponies with really dark or crazy colors.
Malavolent: Huza! Someone else!
Malavolent: See, I like Luna and Thunderlane, and they're both darker ponies.
Like really, every second one is a pony avatar of Satan.
GilDash|EqD: Well Luna is princess of night, so it makes sense.
GilDash|EqD: Their colors are fit, and are still quite light colors.
Bud almost all the other ponies are made in bright colors.
i tried to draw my OC thousands of times GilDash|EqD without one single success...
Malavolent: Yeah. I know what you mean though. I don't like pitch blacks and the like either. :D
GilDash|EqD: Well, I'm glad I'm not the only one.
Magical_pablez94: Well, I'd just like to draw her so I can get my mind's eye on her... ;)
Malavolent: They just look so... wrong. :D
Malavolent: I agreed with you too...
this is me, 5.5 hours from when i need to wake from class, not going to bed
GilDash|EqD: :D
Om: I know, sorry I didn't mention you :(
GilDash|EqD: " Like they came out of this world. "
Malavolent: Tis kay, just yanking your chain
nice background Wrek
Who gets the reference, kids?
my bad, 6.5 hours from class
either way
GilDash|EqD: my OC pony was pretty easy to do... i just used the pony generator....:D:D
Magical_pablez94: I felt so limited with the generator
same here
not enough hair styles
I would make my OC pony from scratch, should I make one.
Aye
Om: yeah me too, expecially on da mane type, but i'm adaptable:D
Magical_pablez94: Fair enough.
I'm fed up with OC's with recolered Fluttershy hair.
I would link some of my "art" but they would just look even worse next to wreks soo. That won't happen.
Om: Link them anyway, it's not a competition.
Malavolent: Is always a competition.
how does applejack do her hair?
I only wanted to make you feel better.
Phase4: Magic?
Om: Why do artists always hate their work? I'm a writer mind, so I'm of the same mind. :D
Om, earth pony : /
earth pony magic of course
Malavolent: I apriciate that. But I be a pecimist.
Phase4: Yes she is. Earth pony magic
lol Dken2021
hello im back :)
GilDash|EqD: Same here. I'm writing some story and while I think it could be better, my friend described it as "Epic".
hai teh_Tharassan
is this german metal?
she's got hair ties in both her mane and tail, how does she do that
GilDash|EqD: That is because my stuff is actualy bad soooo
Phase4: Mayhaps big mac does her hair?
Malavolent: Goddesses do I get good ideas. The moment they're on paper or written down though... :D
Anyone find it wierd how Magmar is the SPITFIRE Pokemon?
Om, i cant imagine big mac working a hair tie
GilDash|EqD: True dat.
Hey Phase4
ohai Dermathil
Phase4: And that is why I propose the idea. Not likely, but possible.
Malavolent: I think that's why I let myself come up with all these ideas, but never actually sit down and try to write them all out... I'd have a fuckign novel length book full of just ideas if I did that. :D
Litwick: Sexy Magmar?
magmar has an odd shaped head
GilDash|EqD: I don't really think about ideas, I just ride the bus and suddenly I get an idea how the story should continue. I don't bother writing it down too. :D
Malavolent: I've got 8 years worth of ideas in this head spanning some 25+ works. Only half of them are fanfics. :D
it's good to write your ideas down, that way you won't forget
GilDash|EqD: You write a lot, don't you?
Dken2021: I can't write them down, that's my problem. :)
Malavolent: Not at all. :D
Malavolent: That, again, is the problem. I'm good *when* I write, but I don't. :D
GilDash|EqD: You could be a fanous writer one day. If you weren't so lazy. :D
GilDash|EqD: I wish I had that problem.
should i be on here during class
necroshadow123: yes.
Malavolent: I'm not sure if it's because I'm lazy... or scared. ;)
so...HI :)
GilDash|EqD: Scared of what?
hai hai ACS13123
Malavolent: A lot of the ideas I have feel so big, that I don't know how to tackle them.
GilDash|EqD: Hey, I've always wanted to write a Fantasy/Reality genre book. At least, I'm trying to do it.
Malavolent: I keep feeling like they have to compare to the most well-known works in terms of quality and the like, despite having no real experience into the art. :D
lol ok Om
GilDash|EqD: You've got to start somehow.
Okei im back =O
GilDash|EqD: I know that feel
GilDash|EqD: If Twilight could get published, your story can be even better.
Malavolent: I've got some 10 novel ideas in my head, a lot of them fleshed out. How I've managed to keep them distinct and seperate from each other over 8 years is weird. :D
/me gumbles along with the music
Malavolent: Yeah, I guess so. :D
Airpuff: You left?
Om Eeyup dinner
Airpuff: Didn't notice.
Om Well gee thanks T.T
Om: Why on earth would you clamour for Airpuff. You're not feeling lonely, are you Ommy? ;)
GilDash|EqD: I think about one long story, I guess it would be long as LotR, if I wrote it all down.
GilDash|EqD: xD
GilDash|EqD: I can get lonely if I want to >.>
Malavolent: I have several that length... -_-
sup guys
GilDash|EqD: Well, they'll all go to waste, if you won't use them somehow.
hai F22skyhunter
GilDash|EqD: You can just take a few ideas from other stories and then write a whole new one, where all the ideas will be in.
Malavolent: I know. It's frustrating. I need to find a way to just do it instead of worrying about it.
who else is scared about telling their freinds that your a brony/pegisister
Somewhere I've read that comfort is the biggest enemy of mankind.
/me raises hand
necroshadow123: No friends, so it was quite easy.
necroshadow123: Yeah, right here! :D
i hide my pony religeon
Back in a few minutes
I love her necklace, Wrek.
Wrek: Nice. ;)
Very nice. :D
Too nice! :$
I agree
You've got a typo in description, just saying.
Confound these ponies, they drive me to... things... :$
*Nicely
GilDash|EqD: ..... those things.. xD
GilDash|EqD: Oh, sensor now eh?
My inner Grammar Nazi is satisfied :
:3
Airpuff: Yeah... things... :D
Om: Hush you. Or I'll get descriptive. ;)
05I cnt TYEP LOL
BACK IN 5 MINUTES
But I still wonder, why does Spitfire have a green sparkle in eye, does a green light shine at her?
GilDash|EqD: Threat agnowlaged.
Om: :)
05you figure it out
Green with envy!
Why envy?
She is the last pony to be envy I think.
Malavolent: Obviously she knows she can't handle RD. ;)
Fortunately I'm always around. :D
GilDash|EqD: IF you think so :D
/me facehoof
05wow
/me leaves while listening to Antonin Dvorak's New World Symphony
05you havent figured it otu yet? :3
its
changeling
xD
Wrek: Symbolism isn't really my thing, until it is. :D
Morning everyone.
Don't tease me, I'm thinking!
GilDash|EqD: You don't say?
But yeah, I guess changeling is the most probable option.
Om: You'd be surprised how much symbolism I try and throw into my stories. Problem: Unless I know of it beforehand, *I'll* miss it. :D
People, tell me good brony music :#
05most happy with the googles to hair
05transition
He's obviously drawing Pikachu guys.
Silly people thinking it's ponies.
05this song
GilDash|EqD: Axidental symbolysm? Seems Lagit
Om: They're accidental until I realise them. Once I do realise them they usually cement or repel in my mind. It's a mindfield game. :D
Whoa, that Fluttershy.
GilDash|EqD: Your games, they scare me.
I'm back, everypony!
I already saw the Spitfire photo, no need to link! :P
hai Sylandest, again
Om: These are just the opening games. ;)
howdy, Dken2021!
Crap, I'm chatting here and I can't manage to do all the things I should do.
I'm out, see ya later.
seeya Malavolent
GilDash|EqD: games? I like games!
Sylandest: Not my games. ;)
Hello everybody
"Hold me / Thrill me / Kiss me / Kill me..."
GilDash|EqD: oh, you mean those games...:$
haai CrimsonPhoenix
Sylandest: Aye. ;)
GilDash|EqD: well, do what you will. I've obtained the game disc I needed, so I'm happy with whatever happens, lol
Hence, why they scare me.
Wrek: All in alll nice work. Will you be drawing more or is that all for today?
Sylandest: My games are physical, dear Sylandest. ;)
05dunno
05maybe
GilDash|EqD: You don't need to spell it out... More than you already have.
GilDash|EqD: meep!
Awesome :P
I'm playing WoW right now :/
FlareChaserxOctavia: I had to go purchase a new disc to play WoW
Sylandest: ah, alright.
oh cool diablo 3
FlareChaserxOctavia: You cant ship with Octavia, that is ilegal >.>
Om: Who said I listened to the government? :|
lol
octavia? but I thought you and colgate had a thing?
FlareChaserxOctavia: Who said that was the goverments law?
Om: But Octavia is some damn fine. ;)
Dken: He broke up with her.
Aye. She is.
Om: who said I was going to listen to any laws?
GilDash|EqD: so aside from the obvious, how are you today? lol
WHICH MEANS I CAN MAKE MY MO-I'm joking.
well not sure how you break up with a cartoon pony, but whatevs
FlareChaserxOctavia: >_>
Om: well, its true.
Sylandest: Same old, same old. ;)
05wut
I take it lazers hurt.
Om: Lasers.
GilDash|EqD: That is what I said. Lazers
05effing lazers
Om: Stop it with the z. It's wrong.
LAZEERRRZ
WREK BEAT ERROR 37!!!
HE DID IT
TROLOLO
GilDash|EqD: Something you don't like about lazers?
And now for something completely different. HOLY HELL. 30 degrees celsius outside.
GilDash|EqD: so by same old same old, you mean teasing everypony possible? lol
Current exterior temperature of 86 farenheit.
IN MAY.
Om: Laser stands for "Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation." There is no "Z". Stop it. :)
THIS IS UNHEARD OF.
Hello.
Sylandest: Pretty much. I think I might have to do something to Om if he doesn't keep quiet.
GilDash|EqD: The z comes from the way it is verbally spoken.
GilDash|EqD: But those arent Light, they made of deamon stuffs. So Lazers
Hiya everybody.
Dermathil: Laser is an acronym, not just a word.
Om: I will do things to you.
GilDash|EqD: oh dear, what did Om do?
GilDash|EqD It is still in the dictionary
Sylandest: Argue back. :D
Dermathil: Go and bring me this dictionary and prove it.
I think my cousin's internet hates me
GilDash|EqD: You cant hurt me I haz LaZers!
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
/me sucks on Om's ear.
GilDash|EqD: oh no, that never works...I remember too well, lol
And besides, LANGUAGE EVOLVES. So Laser will eventually become Lazer.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/laser
THERE'S YOUR DICTIONARY
MERRIAM-WEBSTER
/me gloats and laughs diabolically
Disreagard sucking aquire LAZZZZERS!
Dermathil: And nowhere on there is it spelt "lazer."
SLANG
LAZER IS SLANG
Sorry if I seem harsh on this, I was threatened with violence by the physics teachers. :D
The language is NOT a static thing, but a living organism! It evolves and will eventually become lazer, its own word.
/me licks the inside of Om's ear.
GilDash|EqD: it's ok, it happens to all of us
Dermathil: Not if I can help it. :)
The same evolutionary process that turned Thou into You
You can't GilDash.
D-disreagard l-licking. And Keep! LAZER!
Dermathil: I wouldn't underestimate GilDash|EqD
Sylandest: You wouldn't underestimate ME.
Dermathil: I haven't yet, lol. I never underestimate anypony
/me kisses Om on the mouth to shut him up.
/me turns head away "Lazer!"
But you are. For I am not underestimating him. Lazer will eventually become a word on its own. Compare Ye Olde English and modern, international english. Or The many french dialects before Napoleon grouped them all together and said that the Parisian french was the only true french.
GilDash|EqD: you're a persistent one, lol
(Or a more modern example, Canadian french and European French.)
Om: There's only going to be so much lower that I can kiss. ;)
Dermathil: in that case, I apologize. And you make a good argument there
Language evolves constantly.
Dermathil: It does, but not Laser. :D
/me ponders threat and weighs the pros and cons...."Lazers...are still better than lasers"
Om: GilDash|EqD pounce incoming in 3...2...1...
/me kisses Om slowly down the neck.
Sylandest: What good timing. :D
GilDash|EqD: I have my moments, lol :D
As of the present you are correct. But in the long term, one can realistically predict that the word will change with time into Lazer due to how often it is used by those who do not know the correct written form of the word.
as L.A.S.E.R. isnt just a name , but short for Light Amplified somethinorwhatever it will remain as is
/me is now very silent
TrixieMuffin: Thank you. :)
Om: I thought so. :)
Incorrect, TrixieMuffin. The acronym is the most used form of the expression, so in the dictionary it is considered a word in its own right. A word whose definition fits the full form of the acronym.
Language is not a static construct. The rules of grammar get revisions every few years.
Some words are removed from dictionaries and replaced by new ones.
!lag
!ping
!pong
As much as it is nonsense, that's how it is.
Xchat gah
why won't it reconnect when my wifi drops
/me pushes Om back and licks him on his stomach.

Hi verypony

Hello SirGanjalf.
Om is gone
02why not just use mIRC HML?
destroy ALL the barrels
sorry, I got dc-ed. What'd I miss?
one sec-
Om is gone? Aww... I wanted to have some more fun. ;)
BTW: someone's waiting for Torchlight2?
GilDash|EqD: not in here. Other channels exist for that. Bronystate is not one of them.
GilDash|EqD: you're never satisfied, are you? lol
02oh
Sylandest1: No, not really. :D
02why not just use windows?
I dunno
Bored
Dermathil: Pssh, I was just making sure Om learnt his lesson. :p
GilDash|EqD: well, it looks like you learned him good. he vanished, lol
I mean, Mint *almost* does everything my Win7 does
Except hibernate
Sylandest1: Learnt him too good, apparently. :D
Suspend works, but hibernate will be dealt with later
I mean, got Winamp running, so I'm able to play most of my old music now
lazers and gone~
GilDash|EqD: lol, he got the last word in
02but is there anything Linux lets you have that windows doesn't?
02XD
Sylandest1: I'll be waiting for him when he next arrives. :)
Nothing so far
GilDash|EqD: haha! I don't know if he'll be flattered or apprehensive
11,02o___o
howdy, SuperBrony64
Sylandest1: He'll be learned. Which is how it should be. :)
/me wants to do a Super Inazuma Kick
SuperBrony64: Holla! :)

VenHur96: Holla! :)
Lil_B: Im worse! :D
Lil_B: nonsense! What makes you say that?
fine
:p
14:3
I uses MS Paint, so that's makes me worse...er...
GilDash|EqD: im sure you are a good artist
There isn't one but TWO Rarishy ship fic in FIMfiction.net
Sylandest1 because i can never finish what i have started... also I#m just nodd good at eather art or music
hello all
This day is going to be a good day
I'm Back!
14hi
WB
Sylandest1: Considering I haven't drawn anything more complicated than a hexane ring in about 3 years, I'm going to call BS on that. :D
You've been gone for ages
I meant the feature box
yes
yes I have
14ohh I remember you :3
*nods*
GilDash|EqD: then maybe you draw them really well! I refuse to let anypony put themselves down! Not on my watch!
hello all.
GilDash|EqD you are going to call B(rony)S(tate) on it?
14how is?
Lil_B: Keep trying, I am sure you will succeed.
Lil_B: Bullshit, actually. :)
sounds like a bullshit and shenanigans discussion.
/me hugs WallDives.
WallDives: Nope, just the usual. :)
Just gota draw with lazers~!
ah.
not bad, just enjoying my free time whenever I have it
u guys know rule 34?
/me stares at Om with fire in her eyes.
pony_3241: post and get kicked.
pony_3241: Which troll are you today? =_=
why wall dives?
I refuse to believe that anyone who is willing to try and draw something will fail. Art is art no matter what. GilDash|EqD, Lil_B, both of you have already succeeded because you have tried. You're better than me in that regard at least
pony_3241: rules. read them.
Sylandest1: I haven't tried. That's why I know I'm no good. :D
Woah Sylandest1 wise words
I terms of Art I'm only cabiple of simple Pixel-Art (i can't even make a Desktop pony) and in terms of music I'm mostly Chiptune, but it mostly sounds..."OK for your first time"
Can I post some samples and get Feedback?
did my chat die?
GilDash|EqD: Have you sat down, with a pencil or pen or whatever have you, and drawn something, even remotely with shape or form? yes or no?
Well, if you try 0 times, you have a 0% success rate.
Lil_B: feel free to, i will provide feedback
Sylandest1: Once upon a time. I doubt I've improved since then. :D
Sylandest1 prepare yourself
WallDives: Thank you, that's my point. :D
/me is prepared
DIEAHBLOW TWEEEEEEE!E!!E!E
RustyMeat: Holla! :D
hai GilDash|EqD
GilDash|EqD: You won't know until you sit down and do it. No one here is gonna call you out to say you're terrible or bad or anything. I encourage any kind of creativity, regardless of the form
http://derpy.me/zPxxz
Sylandest1: I know, but I just... Aww, I don't know now. :$
Om: SO MUCH PAIN!
Sylandest1 This is the first song i made, i worked quite a bit on it http://soundcloud.com/lilb-7/scaling
GilDash|EqD: If anything, you can expect positive support from me for drawing or being creative in any form. I write to be creative, and I know I've written terrible pieces before. But I learn from them to improve. Nowadays, I consider myself to be a competent writer. You just have to keep trying
Lil_B: I would be honored to listen to it :)
Sylandest1 do XD thats why i gave you the link XD
http://rule34.paheal.net/ go fap pony lovers
lol
/me is listening
so...um, I'm gonna guess and say that someone is bashing their own art skills, or skills in general, or has some kind of doubts, or something along those lines?
http://rule34.paheal.net/
Bye pony_3241, nice knowing you.
http://rule34.paheal.net/

http://rule34.paheal.net/
ohai Digitalis.
WallDives: Gil and Lil_B were feeling down about drawing and I kinda took a soapbox and wanted to cheer them up
kick him
lawl
This isn't Digitalis its a wall
implying i dont have that site open anyways
ew
I was wondering why it took the troll that long at all.
TrixieMuffin: tmi.
