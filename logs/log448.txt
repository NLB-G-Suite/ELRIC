This is an ORDER
/me hair has been braided
AWW CRAP! BRB EVERYPONY
11,01Dermathil: Modern mainstream games are a joke nowadays.
11,01And Ubishit is a horrible publisher anyway.
11,01Ubishit invented the worst DRM in history.
Saturn: <3
11,01That's enough reason for me to hate them.
Fill my heart up with sunshine sunshine
08,01otakon: i stopped doing it; too busy
Saturn:
08,01otakon: maybe on thursday
/me feeds off of otakon's rage
11,01Ubisoft still likes it.
all I'm going to say is on disc DLC is garbage, and thats my 2 cents.
08,01Gunthler: http://test.du.cx/smilething.mp3
11,01Modern mainstream games suck anyway.
Ubisoft is not that harsh.
cant we just say that all publishers are evil and shit, and get on with something else more interesting?
/me wubs assasins creed
11,01Not all of them are bad.
Yeah. I guess I still have 2 hours I can go back to my fic
Saturn: Whats all this then? :d
08,01Gunthler: i was messing around with my field recorder
I just wish I didn't spend the entire day out. I only had time to watch Season 4 reboot and then I had to leave again
And the smaller ones tend to be idiots
Case in point: THQ
*sighs*...
HOW DARE YOU INSULT THQ
THQ IS GOOD GUYS
11,01Ubisoft.
11,01THQ uses on-disc DLC.
11,01And online passes.
HAHAHAA
11,01They are NOT good.
PICS
dat rage
00,03On an unrelated note:
Hello.
I have tons of THQ games and I have not seen on-disc DLC
00,03Lik dis if u cry evertime: http://e621.net/data/sample/bb/80/bb80d6ce1bc1a02f7a7c5449a2a3055e.jpg?1307932721

meh. rather not have to guess.
/me liks Scoot-Scootaloo's link
02wb
00,03That's the horsehead nebula!
RAAAAAWR
2hai
THQ is still a shit company... doesnt matter if they make Warhammer 40k...
11,01Dermathil: Look up Saints Row 3.
/me loves Astronomy
Saints Row 3? Not enough replaty value IMO
11,01I lost my case else I would take a pic.
00,03lol :D
thanks
Saturn she needs Orions belt to keep her pants up :D jking
02how goes?
/me shrugs.
*at
11,01Smaller ones.
actually... Relic makes the Warhammer 40k games, like Dawn of War... THQ just publishes it...
i really like Omletes
capcom and konami.....
yourself?
:D
I like toast
6_9
11,01Capcom is bad with on-disk DLC.
:(
why... am i talking about this crap? its just making me angry... i done with this convo... lurk mode, go...
11,01And some always-on DRM for console games.
/me noms on da Omlete :3
THQ did some bad decisions, but they are part of the GOOD GUYS in the publishers melting pot.
Omlet?! where?!
/me spins in a cirlce then sits down
YOU BAKA
I like Spyro.
:P
11,01EA published ME3.
he y guys hwos everyone doigng tongt?
Spyro is a cool character.
night night
Is anything happnin'?
/me never cried really as a child
11,01E3: Sequels and motion controls.
Eeew motion control
Feels like dancing
11,01Caring about gamers is good when you actually make them.
Dances
"EA, its in the game"
oh right *derp*
11,01Instead of doing nothing but selling them.
6_9
02I'm doing pretty good
02Suddenly I’m feeling restless
and remember when Square put out good games?
do you have a bad connection?
00,03FIFA <3
11,01THW is going bankrupt, and they deserve it for using online passes and on-disc DLC.
fifa?
and this is coming from a Phantasy Star child, I didnt play a FF until I was in Middle School.
11,01*THQ
2Yeah, Spyro is pretty awesome
Lost Odyssey was okay.
FF6 and FFT are my favorite FFs.
when Aeris/th died, people cried, I laughed at them, cause Alis did the same shit years earlier.
RainbowBilts: I have two. One to watch vidoes and one to post
still have my SNES copy of 3/6 and instruction manual.
um
11,01And how do you know they didn't use on-disk DLC for those titles?
03it keeps showing that I have an unread message even though it doesn't show which one is unread
03I read all my messages
03(both present and past tense)
11,01>Uses online passes, >Deserves to go bankrupt. >No sympathy for online pass-using publishers.
ok, I'm kinda mad now.
02odd
This convo is interesting :D
11,01EA is circling the drain for similar shit.
Hi Everypony!
I'm back
also, only listing games from the Warhammer 40k universe doesnt make a publisher good...
i find it baffling that my youngest sister has elected to be a vegetarian. she does not even like most vegetables. she does not eat a proper amount of food each day, or get the proper nutrients. she counts calories to the extreme. AND SHE WANTS TO STUDY DIETARY NUTRITION
11,01They've used online passes for years.

What's up with the ladybigs?
honestly... whenever Val streams, i dont say shit about anything... its just easier than way...
also, if you dont like something... dont say you dont like it, just dont watch the damn thing...
I've learned it's just best to just go do something else for a while...
Spike is awesome in this. :3
It's Spike
Seriously
Lol.
ikr

I have a feeling the mods actually like this.
Just Val, I hope.
Sassy aren't they . . .
I bet there's another one of these hidden around the net somewhere
those ladybugs are overly girly
Alice's tea part involved psychotic individuals . . . intentional reference. :P
I used to rip the wings off of ladybugs when i was 4
now i know why
lol
You crazy, man.
Lol, ikr

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7Z0apgiCZU anyone else remember this?
Actually
That should be there
:)

night DuskStarshimmer|inso
Theres a fifth season coming out in October
and apparently its not just cgi theres live action as well
hm
04Solomon's Revenge mod
Live Action?...
No thanks.
07I've gone through most of the options
XD
shhh that blasphemy in these parts
The joke is that Dash is always shipped! :D
It's not an option
You have to edit the CSS files
I'm trying to find the exact problem atm
http://www.lugia.us/forum/Themes/ho-oh/css/index.css
dat spacing
/me hugs Saturn
i know that feel Saturn...
8,1if i was younger, maybe
04So it should be completely up to date now
8,1but St Andrews is not the place for someone in their mid 20s
Time to move?
8,1it's a place for kids and freshers
I found it
and change -1820C0Bem to -1000em
Saturn: yeah I guessed
Saturn: maybe you should try this one :)
lol
O U Saturn! :D
Saturn: of corse
Saturn: maybe... maybe...
04No, I haven't considered that
04I wouldn't know how, Kriel
8,1marriage gone to pot? hook up with Saturn
04Windows 7
07I should probably also ask how to get to index.css in the first place lol
er sec
lol
Saturn: it's the solution to everything
8,1indeed
Go to Configuration -> Themes and Layout
Then Modify Themes
8,1except an overabundance of hooking up
I have no idea which themes have that screwed up
feel like beer grills? hook up with Saturn
02Ohai NS
8,1better hook up with Saturn
I would also suggest copying everything inside the file
ok, that should start in a second
there we go
before editing
04Hmm, alright, I'll give it a try
Oh I see you aleady knew that.
I can see that meme happening.
:D
BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL
02seeya NS

Joke.

Stean doesn't like having fun.
i'll just take a photo and then go collect the money
wrong'
04And I actually can't find the option to run Kotor in XP
ill see if i can find that for you
07right

of visiting and viewing a few pages
02I just was comparing free hosting to paid

but free hosting is crap

>_>
Pigman is just trying to get eaten.

O.o
04I'm absolutely beyond pissed off right fucking now

04I wanna chew his fucking head off
No, man. He left.

O_o

And I guess good for him too...
Why? Was his advice shit?
I'm sure he didn't mean no harm, man.
04I get that
04But it doesn't mean that I don't want to just wring his neck
Aye.
04AND WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE FUCKING MODS
04HUH
/me is about ready to fucking kill somebody

04I'm not sure yet
04My computer was very slow upon reboot
Do a scan and things. =/
Antivirus
Meant a scandisk
Oh damn >.<
To check for damage
Aye. Checking for damage might be a good first step.
04I don't know HOW to check
it'll show you whats stealing cpu power
brb
You know, maybe that mod ain't worth it...
04So then I tried to boot the system again
o_o
04So then I turned it on *again*
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/156571
04So at that particular point and time I'm freaking the fuck out
04Bells are going off in my head, "WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!!!!!"
lol
04I DON'T FUCKING KNOW
04I'M NOT COMPUTER SAVVY
04SAVVY?
Hmm
Okay dude.
05i say kill its power
04Well no shit
05open the case and see if its warm
Did this start after trying the mod to work?
04Do..what?
^
04My entire computer is hot
04Well
04Not all of it
05yes but the source, need to find the source
04Only the left half is hot
04SPEAK ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER
05skype then?
:o
:O
04Listen to me
04Just
05nej utan från och med nu är tech suppor svensk
:O
04Just fucking listen
Dat english
Oh my.
05deserved that
04Do not
04Fuck with me
04Right
04Now
04I have already lost my goddamn computer once
o_o
04I don't want to lose it again
05instead, do as I say. unplug any power if you havent. and open the case
04What are you talking about
its a heat problem most likley
Doesn't he have a laptop?
04Yes, I'm using a laptop
^
04Gateway
05do you know the exact model type?
Hey Everypony
Hi Trixie.
Goood
my day 's been cleany uppy because no power and nothing betterto do!
Oh, hello everypony. I'll only be on for a while.
04Will you all listen to me
04I have run this computer multiple times for very long periods of time
(ducks in cover)
04Not once has it EVER done anything like that, and it only does it when I install a mod on Kotor
(ducks lazor)
victory
Trixie: shhh
It was a memory leak then, that caused an overheating.
04And even the other times when I booted it back up after Kotor killed my laptop, it didn't fuck up anymore until I tried to run Kotor again
(is quiet)
04It's too coincidental
kotor?
04Way too coincidental
04It has to be the mod
04Has to be
04Only Kotor destroyed it
Do not uninstall Kotor yet
05did it run fine without the mod? then yes most likley the mod
04*the mod
Trixie: Oh, I remember...(winks*
04Trust me, I won't be installing mods for Kotor ever again
(winks)
05ok now
Let's all take a moment to breath here...
05we know that something probably overheated due to the behaviour
04If it overheated, it came from the processes of the mod
bye guys
05like
05run the exe and boom
04No
05good
How do you mean "System dead"
04Like
04Dead
04Not "game crashes"
.....
O.o
05my best guess right now would be to let the laptp atleast reach room temperature
04I'm talking just "dead"
04No
04Dead
04As in
04The whole computer suddenly shuts off
04Just off
leeave it off for 20 min
04...I'm not turning this off
04NOt right now
......
05it needs to cool as low as possible
04I'm on my laptop right now, and it's fine
Or it'll most likely melt by now.
O.o
Read ._.
SHUSH
Trixie: Circuitary damage
04Listen, please, you're fucking scaring me right now
04My computer has never had this problem
04THEN STOP FUCKING TELLING ME MY GODDAMN COMPUTER IS GOING TO FUCKING MELT
it might just come with age
IT HASN'T MELTED YET.
04STOP
04FUCKING STOP
04I don't want to risk it
04Do you understand
04I'm scared
04Yes
05and its not acting up yet?
04No
05no uneccesary risks you know
05and as in rest i dont mean just let it stand there, i mean beign completly off.
theres a tempreture sensor on the cpu
04I did, I got rid of the mod
05nice.
05(danger zone as in not shutting down on you again)
04Wrek's what's an IFO file
04So then it's nothing dangerous?
05Other applications associated with file type IFO:
04Okay...alright
05its liek ESP for skyrim
05oh right
04Wrek
04Listen to me
04I'm going to turn my computer off soon
04But
04I want you to be on skype

Good afternoon everypony
>this song
seems logical
/me glomps Phase-4 no good reason
thats not very effective, it wold produce mostly ammonium-chloride
:)
not to mention that you would need about -20°C to liquidify ammonia
suit tries?
But yeah, I made a mistake when I said "liquid".
I don't drink Coffee and rarely Cola
me neither
Energy drinks count guys! :D
Yes, but it stays in gaseous form till -20
never had an energy drink...
Right-o.
I'm crazy, I don't do Drugs i don't drink Alkohol, I don't Smoke I don't drink Coffee...
-_-
wat
he mustve thought it was homeopathic :D
Energy drinks have about 4 different types of caffine
and sugar. thats the other kicker.
>hot girl walks up and sits next to me on couch
And tourine. :D
>acts like I don't exist
:<
I hate energy drinks
latte or tea for me
Meh, they taste like crap. Good for Jagerbombs though. :D
Anything with an "ene" sound at the end, is a type of caffine.

06hM?
06i know

"ene" just indicates that its not saturated

*sweet
Ello there, everypony.
I hate doing this, but I must, goodnight everypony!
0610 = 100%
ROAR
Monster Rehab. It's a non-carbonated energy drink made from tea and lemonade. It doesn't taste like an energy drink, and on top of that it's only 20 calories for a whole can.
061 = 10%
061 is lowest 030
oh ok
I'll be back in 5-10 minutes
02oh
like our system just we are 1-6, 6 being the highest x3
02then how is a 9 a bad thing?
02XD
06it was DA/TST related
there is a saturation limit
02oh
ohdear
I wouldn't neccessarily say it's 'healthy', since it still has all the same things that normal energy drinks have (taurine, caffeine, etc), but in terms of calories, it's way healthier than the others, and it doesn't taste like crap like the zero-calorie diet energy drinks.
06ladies liked it
02here we use letters
I mean, the sodas at least looks good becuase of color.
02A+ is best
