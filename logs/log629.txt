As I said, I enjoyed watching it ONCE, not wanna see it again.
I refuse to touch PvP until I'm not a noob.
Oh celestia this song

04God knows I hated Hancock
I thik this movie was average. Not bad, but not good either. I wouldn't mind watching it again, but I would probably do something else while watching it.
YEAH
?
Hancock? Never seen
/me actually reads credits
I dislike most movies I see, but hate few
Wow I never thought this movie would generate this much hate
factually
11,02Ponies are taking a cartoon too seriously...

How do you get lost in grocery store?

don't blame the winner. He picked Hugo /me blames the mods.
tomorrow, can we at least play something else over the credits?:P
04Ah, okay
Babes was WMC.
not just animals
of Furryism I prefer feral
I like GW2 well enough, I just keep feeling like in six months I'll drop it and go back to GW1 again
Babes in Toyland was WMC'd because the colors caused headaches, right?
Well that's just awesome.
Babes is not even worse, its in its own dimension of bad
Guys, just quit complaining
Babes was 2.5 hours long.
How can you say "Animals" have no "human trait"
That's just silly
goddammit
04Whoa whoa
I havent had one, never had one

IT'S A TRAP!
:)

Hi random Encounter.

poor fluttershy going in way over her head
You know the Everfree Forest.. that no one ever goes into... except everyone of us.
Eat little angels.
Twilight is best pony. Just saying
Oh hooray
Fluttershy is best foal-sitter

She'll never have kids at this point.
dat hair
Not related.
drat I seem to have deleted it
hair animation
I can't even see that.
emo hair
why Stinko leav?
Using popped-out browser IRC, I can't even see that.
suffice it to say I walked into the wrong IRC room
forest is not scary enough
Everfree Forest is like the Forest in Harry Potter.
Oh, one of my very favorite episodes.

That is why I live very close to the forest

The CMC are all foals.

Too many cooks

Why do you need a stethoscope to do carpentry?
jackhammers too
seems legit
Misery.
and to think Applebloom is actually a GOOD Carpenter
Hm?
Foals are.. up to six months old, right?
HALT! HAMMERZAIT!
I now imagine Fluttershy having a ridiculously agressive voice in her head sort of like Inner Sakura from naruto. :P
up to a year.

I was told that was the chatters.

Scoot-scoot-scooot-scoot
CMC Lawyers!
That's not arguing, that's just being contradictory.

Eek!
The genius of the show is that the CMC aren't annoying.
I don't understand how such a great meme originated from such a bland origin.
Dat screAM
too much squeaks
dat squees
obligatory stoned jokes
It doesn't actually have teeth though, that's just the way the inner part of its mouth is shaped.
Dear heavens my spelling. *hurls*

and he has had no character development at all
same with Sansa
school is starting that gives me less time with everypony!!!

Sorry. You did not say this.
Sansa had a clear-cut arc
starts as naive girl, is forced to grow up too fast to survive in the world of dirty politics
instead
Are we all still buffering?
Sansa is really frustrating. I hate fans that like to watch her suffer, though.
I dont get it
HARRO BUFFER, I like that. :D
oh
The film stopped or something.
and is still the same person she was in book one
That's why I stick to simpler titles for my fantasy reading. Like HPATHBP and TWWRLAM and PJATBOTL and TSA:AHTOCT
I'm lost my head hurts
:(
Look up to the skies and seeee

If it's stupid then I won't care. If it tries to gut-punch me, well, I've been gut-punched enough to not care.
I was kind of pissed at them showing Stannis screwing Melisandre

Sex?! It's a movie about DAGRONS
Spike.
Prolfion and Blue lipped man.
I watched near 2007.............then i saw the review 2 years later
It's a movie about Spike fighting the other Dagrons.
I've heard of D-War through Rifftrax
In the show, anyway.
Rifftrax did this?
in the book the sex scenes are still there

(M.Bison) Yes! Yes!
Dammit. Now I have to make up my own jokes during the movie.
Does anyone else suspect that Tyrion is the only person getting out of this at all?

Well, the Rifftrax is talking over the dialog in the movie, and frankly forcing itself on the scenes without dialog.
While I'm here, anyone know a good Irc client? Hydra sounded good on paper, but last update is 2010 and half the features are disabled

When did the Mane 6 start sounding like the MST3K crew?
lol
Pratchett's not gonna let Alzheimer's take him.
one of the most imaginative minds in the world
He's going to die first.
Must touch EVERYTHING!
and it's gonna slip away
Rifftrax makes this much more watchable
:'(
04Haha
flashbackception
Pratchett is going to die in the next few years. Assissted suicide.
Xmen.

Kung-Fu Hustle?
Suffice to say, the way this Rifftrax is being shoved down my throat like this, my chances of ever enjoying Rifftrax are diminishing.
House of Leaves.
You don't say?
I've heard of that.
I've heard. Of that.
00,10fun fact: stfu I am 15 seconds ahead of you by the time you bitch it's already been fixed
I need to read it.
I'm already sitting.
I'm not reading that now because I intend to read the whole thing.
0,14same
00,10no
I can think of Stover, Bujold....
that's about it
Sci-fi is on the decline recently.
0,14I really should read House of Leaves
Stop bothering him you twonks.
But I thought they were in heaven.
Back :)
Rifftrax? XD
it's brilliant.
There. Had to refresh...

How? How did she defile heaven?
Is this Kung-Fu Hustle?
"my wife died giving birth to the child!" *yay*
Yeah
OK, here it goes........
According the TV Topes anyway.
00,10Kandarihu, bad night to bitch. I recomend you stop
04SHE IS THE CHOSEN ONE
House of Leaves basically takes every convention you're used to for novels and tells it to go fuck itself.
Ugh
lol
meh
brb
The child has Garble on her.
pony
PONY!
04Little did they know, she was a mare
those kind of books don't really do it for me
she's kind of chunky
Finnegan's Wake is incomprehensible trash
HOERS
04And they lived in Ireland
It's a book about a book about a movie about a house that's a labyrincht.

00,10wait.......did we just have a thirdlayer flashback?
YES.
05,15yup
lol
manatees
Yes we did
04Only, not nearly as iconic
sea serpent to be precise
the element of harmony
I no longer know what's flashback and what's not.
Is the whole movie flashbacks?
From now on, you must take this necklase from Spencers.
It's dangerous to go alone! Take this!
04But Fluttershy likes it!
05,15We need to go deeper
Anyway, I can empathize with that one. Only Revolutions. Because sometimes, my mind does actually look like that.
Stop switching timelines!
nested flashbacks ftw
00,10suddnly

Pilgrims.
oh boy

WTF
THE HUNS.

Anyone seen Kung-Fu Hustle?
Inception Bwoooooon fits perfectly with this movie.
