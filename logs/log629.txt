CrimsonPhoenix: it's steam :\
The previous 2 hours was prologue
Hello LadyCanary|wubwub, care to share some of your happiness?
13PREPAH TO BROADSIDE
*Attaking walls with pikement*
I mean this Greenlight thingy
*pikemen
CrimsonPhoenix: it's cool but...meh :\
Shizuka: Can't wait till the torch scene
Greenlight might be good for getting small indie and singleperson projects on, like Desura
CrimsonPhoenix: How? Its giving people a chance to pick which games to add
CrimsonPhoenix: It's a nice idea but kind of wrong executed.
I'm skeptical in this whole thing
MadSurge: ^_____^ Sque
I'm nonchalant so far
they review everything that is voted up
Dat scream
maybe now with this greenlight thing we might get Postal 3 on steam :) or Even "Abe's oddysee: HD remake" :)
so tonight is Over the Hedge?
if it fails their inspection- it won't get up anywa
I have a couple of things
that wilhelm
Poor wilhelm. He died a hero
SeaponiesofLiverpool: And D Wars
SeaponiesofLiverpool: yeah :P
vordox: beat me to it
i JUST got the newsletter
7 gonads
kill count compition
Lol
/me is proud to admit he saw Over the Hedge in theatres by himself.
A: Guardians of G'hoole
Vigo fighting orcs naked
B: The Postman
that plot
These kill counts are unfair, Legolas has ranged damage; there's no way Gimli can keep up in a siege
Pony episode: Cherry Bomb
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Yep. And Dragon Wars. *shudders*
Tovler: i saw it on my tv :P
Dragon Wars Rifftrax?
Tommy: He'll run out of arrows eventually
please let it be that one
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Sadly no
I can't remember a damn thing about Over the Hedge
I think I see doubles
Nooooooooooooo
LadyCanary|wubwub: 'tis not a happy day for me
SeaponiesofLiverpool: just the movie :P
otakon17 yeah but that's a huge advantegde at the start of the fight anyway
Some games appears multiple times
Tovler: Hammy!
D-war wasn't an awful movie
Tommy: True
I liked the special effects
D: Why MadSurge
/me shudders thinking about D-War
SeaponiesofLiverpool: More like... Special... uh... Defects. 6_9
NO! I forgot a good b movie
Aaagh Cat is pushing all my desk decoration away
suddenly, a fight!
D-war might be good...or is it a terrible movie ? :(
or A movie?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Dead Alive
Flight of Dragons
i wish we could see Flash gordon again today :'(
can't we pick good indie movies you've never heard of?
Vivix: :( MY CAT DOES THAT TO
you guys probably don't remember Flight of Dragons
dat Testudo formation
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Too unknown but a good B
DJ_POn-3_, so mean cat ;__;
way to jinx it king theodon
what a jerk
I'll say this again
SeaponiesofLiverpool: I do
LadyCanary|wubwub: one of my high school classmates hanged herself yesterday...
Sergio_Scriptor: It was pretty bad... and I usually like things dragon related.
THIS PS2 GAME WAS AWESOME
He just had to go and jinx the whole siege
SeaponiesofLiverpool: That's that dragon movie, right?
here come chariots of fire
that influenced my childhood
Vivix: ikr they always get in the way
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Based off of "The Dragon an the George"
Klumzeedragon: oh boy we are in for a ride tonight :\
we should watch it non-BMN
A hero to all orc kind
and sleeping on keyboards- cats, so attention want
Vordox: I had it for GameCube!
still. <3 u cat
Olympics being held at Helm's deep this year are cancelled due to terrorist attack
Klumzeedragon: It was AWESOME right? :D That fighting engine
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flight_of_Dragons
Tommy: :D
Sergio_Scriptor: :) I'm sure we'll make the best of it.
I want my B movie to win so I can start a trend of good indie movie being picked.
good yet recent
hai everypony :)
I picked Kostner's Postman
Damn they're suicidal
hich I always include
Klumzeedragon: indeed :) i think in here we could watch birdemic and even that we could make it interesting :P
because it is a good movie
how you doing Michael
I never saw Flight of Dragon. :O But it reminds me of the art style of Fern Gulley.
/me hugs alexxm
kinda
DWARF BOMB
alexxm: good, you?
SeaponiesofLiverpool: i actualy like the postman :)
Okay before I go eat I have one thing to say about Greenlight
/me hugs Michael back i'm good
Launch the Dwarf!
the art style is not like Fern Gully at all
Hi Michael!
its Rankin Bass
when it came out it didn't do well
/me hugs Klumzeedragon
Charging after only 1 volly? Aragorns a crap commander
It seems anyone can post anything, I admit that I just now know about this thing but I say that anyone able to post anything is pretty BS
I want it ponified
Rex_Mundi: yup
Klumzeedragon: Um no more like Ralph Bakshi or the Rankin Bass animations
now BRB
He's too worried about that melee vs ranged penalty
with Derpy as Kevin Kostner
SeaponiesofLiverpool: it's just misunderstood,like water-world,i think it's awesome :)
Toledo
:D
water-world was a box office success actually
Hiya Derpy_Hooves
Rex_Mundi: They could have just hung back and kept lobbing volleys of arrows into the choke point
Sergio_Scriptor: Don't know about that. Two movies have been banned from here before. xD
BRB
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Too bad it was boring as hell
ohai Derpy_Hooves
pie!!!
Hiya Scoot-Scootaloo
CrimsonPhoenix|Eatin, it is, but that's how Desura is too. when someone posts something fake they can't win vote, it will be taken down by steam
i love pie!!!!!!
How are ya Michael? :)
Movie tactics trump real tactics
Pie!
give me pie
Klumzeedragon: but those are realy BAD movies :3
The A movie was almost Hugo, but it was rejected ;-;
00,03Hey peoples~
Pinkie Pie!
Klumzeedragon: nice :)
Waterworld budget: 175 bill earned: 264 billion
Scoots!
i love all pies
Tovler: Too new too risky to get
Fl00tersh41: Exactly, the should have waited for the orcs to climb uphill to him whilst raining arrows on them.
otakon17: if you say so! Not sure I've seen those.
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
except cowpies
hey Scoot-Scootaloo
hi Scoot-Scootaloo :)
Klumzeedragon: The Hobbit was done by Rankin Bass animation
otakon17: the movie has been on DVD for almost 6 months.
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo
Tovler: i was there :3
Tovler: Too new
Rex_Mundi: Not many orcs would have made it through in the first place untill the elves ran out of arrows
Tovler: 1.5 years
Postman: budget: 80 bill USA earn 17 bill
Rex_Mundi: By then they'd have plugged the whole in the wall with orc corpses
Aragorn must be getting tons of xp
Ded
Goddamn newb elves, get to the keep!
They had to DRAG Gimli
lol
Unless this is the kind of bs enemy trash that gives 0 xp
otakon17: Oh. :P I see, I see.
elves dont obey to humans :[
Dat headsplit
Derpy as Kevin Kostner in THE POSTMARE
Tommy: They're all level 1 mooks in grey gear
Elves are racist >_>
^watch
Because of this rule, RAWRity stopped picking Chronicle for A movie and instead is trolling for that Bieber documentary.
Sergio_Scriptor: I suppose. But to me Dragon Wars was pretty bad.
ded
YEah
Hiya IshBestPony
We need to watch birdemic
ow my face
level up!
a bad movie is a C movie
" TO THE KEEP" *Run jumps into Horde of enemies*
This movie is bad about getting really loud suddenly lol
ohai IshBestPony
otakon17 but I didn't say ohai yet
a movie that tries to be a and fails is B
Klumzeedragon: well let's see about it :)
IshBestPony: I saw you join, on iPod

SeaponiesofLiverpool: didn't exist Z movies ? or something :\
otakon17 how are you watching this on ipod, ipods don't support flash
Sergio_Scriptor: z for zombie?

Michael: no like Z is like the worst of all time :d i think only like 5 movies ever got that rating :P
Toss the dwarf!!!!!!

Sergio_Scriptor: oh ok lol

2 MEN VERSUS 2000

Suicide mission!

ohai regulars, are you still dead?
Vordox: They'll be fine
Balista
Gimli and Aragorn are to OP for uruk-hai
I have an idea guys: you know how crossbows are really good?
That bridge neeeds something...
I want a losers weekend with me and Meanwhile picking an A and B movie.
I dunno what?
What if we made a REALLY BIG CROSSBOW
Railings?
:(
Tommy: of course :) crossbow are my faovrite type of long rage weapons :)

DED

Railings!
Tommy: a ballista?
I know
kowabunga!
200, YOU gimli?
Defend the ponies!
otakon17: MOAR RAILINGS!!
backstab with a balista
It's just a really odd thought process
noogie time
I have 1 question. Why isn't Gondor helping them?
Lol
:(
nobody knows where gondor is
Tovler: cause gondor is a dick :|
Puch
gondor is being a jerk and burning himselg
hai CCCP
Ouch
Tovler they have they're own invasion to deal with?
*himself
CCCP: *glomps*
Tovler: gondor never helps
Well little kid is dead
Where was Gondor when Littlefoots mom was killed by Sharptooth?
they are Gon dur
Tovler: Gonder had very posh party it had to attend. Aparently Gondor is very apathetic to the folly of its brothers.
:'(
Suddenly trees.
Rex_Mundi: Crying its eyes out bc it was 8 when it saw it(me)
Rex_Mundi: Eating them tree stars!
That gondor is a deadbeat,he owns me the Rent :|
a better question is where was I. I missed all 3 LotR movies 2 weeks ago.
Turn around
I dislike OVER THE HEDGE

poniesrock: try refreshing the stream?
poniesrock try refreshing
hey i got a question
Dat Random Logo
Title logo.
okay
TOO....MUCH....LYIIING
Suddenly title
We've determined that the Bear is Bruce Willis
Ohey, so it just begun
/me sings
buh
Is the bear really Nick Nolte?
why's he not just running for the hills
D:
00,10some big names in this
Bruce Willis?!
Shatner?
yep
WILL SHATNER?
Bruce willis?
Shanter!
yup
okay
Ominous quest to appease a bear: cue the easy listening pop.
lolwut
04Yeah, there's a lot of big names
SHATNER?
I thought the… yeah the Raccoon
BRUCE WILLIS
this movie takes me back to cool parts of my youth. :3 <3
Shatner <3
Question: what if RJ the racoon meet the ponies in ponyville huh?
is this the star wars shatner?
Shanter.
dat Avril
Avril?
05,15Shatner....
04But didn't this movie get less than average reviews?
>Avril Lavigne
Deadlypon3: The bear is deadlier
Shatner's character is awesome
Avril Lavigne?
Racoon is Bruce
05,15wut
Sumica if there is one thing babout Dreamworks, it's that they get big actors
Gary Shandling... I remember that name from some old tv show...
Racoons die when they are killed
I had no idea Bruce Willis was in this movie
Ghosties: Yep.
This movie will be good.
qeue awesome song
i remember this as a furry webcomic
Avril Lavigne as the possum.... :D
by bears
Bruce Willis in MLP. Make it happen.
Ghosties the movie is okaaay
Camelot?
All i know is that Avril Lavigne plays the teenage possum
thought he died 10 years or so ago
Shogipony no it's a newstrip
El Rancho Canterlot:P
CANTERLOT
Ghosties: It's good, at least. Not great.
Still High Budget
dat turtle
wanda is the black and white cat
Tank!@
So therefore its AAAAA
camelot? you mean canterlot! YYEEEAAAHHH!!!
Shatner is also a opossum
That's a lot of big names. Though I wonder what the deal is with putting actors in movies. Surely a quality voice actor is better and cheaper then big name actors? Or do their names help sell the movie?
suddenly turtle

00,10the comic it comes from is not exactly ment for kids
I pretty much agree with Ghosties.
Globalization has it's good sides too. For the humans at least.
PillowPoni|Minecraft: i got it when it was like, £5 and as for steam, i couldn't find you

Sumica: There's a comic?
Sumica: srsly?
BronyInstrumental: I go under ThatCrazeeChick
I had no idea it existed in any other form.
04RJ wants to destroy their natural habitat and system of living by introducing them to food stuffs and other chemical laden foods

Cooooookiees...
Red cart FTW!
Sumica: holy shit
COOOKIEESSSS! :O
Stealing is fun!
You know why don't they help him?
delicious
Answer: He's ironically not that smart.
Tree bark is actually very good.
00,10at the same time Ghosties, it would have happend any ways
Bark...
Fear RAWRity
04...
tasty bark
What a coincedence that wagon appeared
RAWRity the bear will hunt him to the ends of the earth
"Yay for donuts"
YAY
BEES
Ghosties, he is arguably the villain, so what is wrong with that?
04Pizza and donuts for breakfast
00,10they already lost there foraging grounds
So hang on, they left a bear inside that small patch of green?
04How sad
donuts
Globalization = Mutually Assured Economic Destruction, right? The whole plan to tie every country's economies together to make it suicidal for any country to try to destroy any other country?
y'ever had coons invade your garage
11,01He wants to give the foragers chemical-laden food so he can be saved from a bear why?
PillowPoni|Minecraft: i got nothing from the search :/
Nyst it was a dream
He's a bear. All he has to do is find an old persons garden to live in.
that wasnt honey :(
04Because RJ isn't going to get his
pizza and donuts is great compared to what they eat
eww
are you sure your stomachs can digest that?
04He's pretty much the main character
BronyInstrumental: Whaaa? That's odd....
u lie
dat crunch
Tree Bark for food. Now they should just eat that instead.
Lovely!! JUST LOVELY!
omnomnomnom
Nittany_Discord to make THEM pick it up for him
Bears don't wander through peoples gardens without being hit by tranq darts.
MrPine23: and before too?
This acutally made me want to eat logs.
he wants them to forage for him
Ghosties: if you prefer bark for breakfast, no one is stopping you
Nittany_Discord, because he doesn't want to be killed by the bear
He's a BEAR, he does whatever the fuck he wants
so he cans teal it
dat acting
Nittany-Discord it will make sense later
Nomnomnomnomnnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnom.
like a dickhead
Fu-
Oh.
Heck, he could jump onto the back of a truck and be miles and miles away from the Bear by the end of the week.
"ffffuck off?"

Ghosties, you know, destroying a creature's habitat, the environment has ways of adapting to this, like when trees get cut...
lol, we're robbing the girl scouts now
Ghosties: I like your opinions. You point out crucial flaws in this movie.
;lol
I have. Old Salem here has a bakery that sells Moravian lemon cookies. THey're fucking delicious.
Imagine Korben Dallas delivering all this dialogue.
Rabbit or rabbid squirell?
That blonde girl is horible
Rabid.
I usually don't talk to people who talk around wagging their finger and holding moral sermons.
Not rabbit.
xD
oooooooooh

BAD TOUCH
So I guess this isn't for everyone in the chat
Bad touch O_o

GREAT
Why are we even discussing flaws and points this movies brings up as opposed to, say, ACTUALLY ENJOYING THE FILM!?
LOL
FANTASTIC
that....wasn't needed
When you think about it, Without RJ to help them get food. They probably would have died anyway. Dark moment for ya.
is there an ignore function?
05,15Nyst but then I'd want to watch that movie....which is better

MrBen It's fun

Rabies
You take lemons and put them in cookies. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO FIGURE THAT OUT?
it's just watching a train wreck
DaringDerpy: Calm down, Ghosties has his opinion.

Poor Verne. Forever alone.

00,10cause it is Bruce willis
04How is Verne the worst thing?
fluttercry: it was a high profile family movie. They ALWAYS get big names for this stuff.
Vern is being an idiot here.
BECAUSE ITS A SILLY MOVIE
04RJ is the worst thing
Poor Angel
If he returns them, he'll get killed.
Kill angel!
dat rabbit
damn angel
ImmaBear, practice
Ghosties: I agree.
04He pretty much caused a massive imbalance to their habitat
uh oh
Don't end up like angel
*hugs CCCP* We're here for ya~
So they won't get food.
:$
PLAY?

shit
oh my god
Am I the only one who thinks Ghosties's points are reasonable?:S
PLAY!!!!!!!!
Ghosties RJ (Bruce Willis) is at least a little bit interesting. Verne is bland, annoying, and often disrupting other people
AlienWarhead: Angel can get hurt.
Just tell them about the bear? Again they will help you.
DOGGIE
Play? :3

Awww the dog justs wanna play :(
He wants to plaaaayyy
PLAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!
Rotty!!! <3 <3
Ghosties, to be fair, the guys that bulldozed their woods over caused the imbalance. RJ is just introducing them to what their home was changed to
and then Bert died. And everyne was happier for it.
Scooby Doo
knowutimean?
lol
Vern always gets hit the worst
The guy who plays Arwin on Zack and Cody is the dog in this movie.
Horny barbie
Plaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
It's Dug from Up but less cooler

Bert?
Mine
Ghosties, besides betraying them for the bear of course
hello?
the turtle
Verne is is name
Is anyone else having framerate issues? Or is it just my PSO2 + Gameguard being a system hog?
...Verne.
I'm calling him bert
LOL
Bert. Pfft.
so much destruction
MrPine23 you mean the two things good about Zack and COdy?
Kandarihu: It's fine here.
JESmith71 the Dog from Up is waaaaaaaay better
In fact, you trust them now. Tell them "Hey, I need to get more food, there's this bear that wants to kill me. Can you help me?" Or "I need your help to save me from this bear."
go vern!
Play TF2 I think he means
well that's how the managed to build the entire neighborhood in a few months, the fences are made of balsa wood
Deadlypon3 Eeyup
That's a pretty strong dog
...not sure if strong dog, or shitty fences
oh god
That is one strong dog
RosePetal RJ has trust issues :P
Nuclear explosion incoming...

If Hammy shows up in this scene there's one obvious reference I'll make...

Fire the retros!
Propane!

This movie is insensitive to the Japanese survivors
Wait. a bunch of food can cause an explosion. Science? What's that?

That whole scene right there was my absolute favorite of the entire film.
Shows all the good crap we put in our food at work.

This scene
much worse than bark, surely
speaking of Propane: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8rh93ekYg1rqk433o1_500.jpg
It's so sad.
Ghosties it's still better than...starving
lol
i remember this movie from when i was a child
Techinally, they should be mad. Verne food.
Ghosties Poweraid is good for you
Dat skunk.
Fluttercry gordon freeman your ASS
Butt vibrating :D
04>future
yeah, see?
04>globalization
Verne, you don't understand that a bear is trying to kill him.
Ghosties: I thought that since the beginning of the movie.
With Dreamworks, don't think about the story
04I get it movie
LOL
I love her voice, sounds like a black woman talking
05,15I'll tell ya hwhat
Ghosties: isn't that the point?
04I got it
DAT POSSUN SAID DAMNIT
dat sounds SOOOOO wrong
just laugh at the jokes
fluttercry I guess bronystate won't show this movie again
ouch
...Wow
and people in main chat not getting that the teenager character is acting stereotypicaly teenage to make fun of it
Whats the matter Verne, could it be you're craving RJ's mcnuggies
Ghosties lol
ouch
dayum
ouch
Nice choice of words.
:'(
yes u r
:'(
oh snap
:(
awww
yes, yes you are
05,15AlienWarhead I'd totally be down for that
Nice going there Verne.
Techinally, you would be dead in a week.
:(
04God, this movie is awful
D:
not hammy
Shit just got real
04Fuck this movie
:'(
awwww
YOU INSULTED PINKIE SQUIRREL!
playing video games, texting, talking in chat, and watching a movie. multitasking at its best:D
what a jerk
Can't we just accept Ghosties opinions?:S
:'( AWwwwww
Verne hit the fail button SOOO HARD
If you did it Verene's way.
Ghosties: are you serious?
lol ghosties really doesn't like this movie
nooooo aaaawwwwwwwwwwww
:(
Tank, you're a jerk.
STELLAAAAAAA
no cleaning that up
shut up ghosties I'm trying to enjoy the movie.
you betrayed us!
Tank, WHY?
Hammy... :(
:'(
Whats the matter Verne-kun, could it be you're craving RJ's mcnuggies
D:
Ghosties: could you please explain for me why globalization is so bad?
:'(
HAMMY
:'(
Yeah. Hammy not stoopid. He retarded!
you just got TwilghtSparkled
Can't say I disagree with him DSNesmith.
and the fucking raccoon ruins the group
this song
no hammy D:
Song time
:'(
Hammy: Fuck this.. I'm stickin to acorns.
the movie goes on so fast
speech 1
nice going
This song + that moment = crying
:.(
See, this sucks. Why does the most hilarious part of the movie have to be immediately followed by such a downer part?
To be fair, Verne's way was actually incredibly inefficient, and he has no real reason to suspect RJ. and hell, RJ had a damn good idea of getting food.
awwww
i hait turtlwz
eh, I dunno, maybe I just didn't have high expectations, but I'm enjoying it decently
People seem to be taking this movie waaaaay too seriously.
Techinally, RJ is kinda the hero because he's giving them food but Verne is giving it away so they would starve so either way RJ is kinda right.
Fou_Lou: Because there needs to be balance for EVERYTHING.
Fou_Lou, that's not Ghosties' opinion, it's the movie writers' opinion.
although this is an unnecessary montage
aww
so emotional!
I would be all "Abloo bloo bloo" and what not if not for teh crappy pop rock
sooo sad
Full moon?
BEAR
:'(
ALL THE FEELS.
i see luna
Uncle RJ.
lol

hnng
He ate Luna.
Probably the opinion of the executive who commissioned this movie.
Welp RJ is dead
La da La Daw
Anyone got a PS3 and wanna play castle crashers and watch this at the same time?
and the bear would get here how exactly !?
HOLY SHIT HE JUST ATE THE MOON
not woona!
He ate the moon. S*it got real.
HE ATE LUNA. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Poor Luna
lolol
Nick Nolte is best bear
Again, why didn't he just run the fuck away.
Luna Nuuuuuuuuuuuu! :(
reminds me to the people who interpreted mlp as sexist and homophibic
NOW YOU WILL PAY FOR EATING WOONA.
dat feel. lol
He should be sage from the bear, seeing that he'd have to cross through the neighborhood to get to them :P
and the bear would get here how exactly !?

Quick_Thinker I dunno

So much angel death
Fluttershy is weeping right now
Wait, didn't Ed eat the moon at one point too?
Our beloved princess Luna was tragically eaten by a Ursa Major... :'(
Maybe we shouldn't stream this movie again........:S
there is no running away

I want to be like you.
I like the movie.
brb guys
kool
Oh, that makes sense.
04<TovlerTheHedge> who the fuck is seeing this global conspiracy shit in a kids movie? <-- first off, it's not a global conspiracy when this shit happens all the time
I don't know.
I like this movie. It's all right.
i love this movie! :p
Kurra a lot of people here are on the fence with this movie
Ghosties has a point
I'm just saying there are some things.
11,02Ghosties: Yup.
it's not a conspiracy, it's called "advertising"
AlienWarhead on the hedge....?
this movie's biggest problem is that it's not sure what it wants t be. Does it want to be a satire to entertain the parents, or a safe, inobtrusive time waster for the little kids to start at for 80 minutes? It fluctuates between the two.
also this is hardly advertising
no brand names, it's making fun of the culture
He's telling the truth.
Well. TIME TO GO COMPUTER SHOPPING! See you guys later! :)
busted?
FlutterMEDIC: THANK YOU!
Kurra :D
it's clearly satire
Ghosties: they always say it's not a conspiracy, try again (actually don't)
Ghosties they might not be 100% serious when saying it
yeah
I'll agree with that
That's a really convincing lie.
Checklist? ^_^
hey everypony
04So globalization doesn't exist?
It's Santa's Checklist.
Dun dun dun
04You're essentially saying neocolonization isn't real
UH OH THEIR GOING ALL NIGHT GUYS
Can we just stop arguing with Ghosties? He has his opinion, let him have it.:|
ohai Pearly
05,15There's no balance. The kid parts are painful for adults, and the adult parts sail COMPLETELY over the heads of kids
Ghosties: breath man
hey Michael
awww
Ghosties whats wrong with globalization?
dat easy?
hiya Pearly
RJ are you crazy! You are killing everyone!
I mean, take a look at the monkeys in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. They LIVE off the stuff we eat.

11,01Agreed Ghosties.
DOCTOR!
EXPLOSIONS/10
05,15It's funny because I'm not trolling
Yeah Stormbluff really went up in numbers the other day.
does everything have to have hidden meanings?
Dragon Wars next... Prepare for terrible movie.
Ghosties: fun? do you remember that word?
I thought it was--polarized? I don't know the words, but I remember not liking it when I first saw it
SuperBrony64, the meaning it has isn't hidden at all, but there definitely is one.
04And I'm not trolling either
The bear was relocated to a forest far away from city limits and is now learning how to steal picanic baskets
WOO BEN FOLDS ~
Wait a minute. Didn't someone say that all Dreamworks animated movies have dancing in the end?
PONIES!!!!

fluttercry i mean at least you must respect that time was put into it, the VA isnt bad either
I give this movie 7/7 asses!
Yup
Aye.
movie isnt anything great, but it dos get some good laughs from me, which is more than I can say about other movies
04Look, it just bothers me alright
hope you don't complain about hidden meanings in ponies now
Ghosties I wanted to choose Hugo anyway
Everybody dancing/100

Hello Nittany_Discord
get rich quick seminars/10
Wazoo/10
this is why the old loto system was better, random moive
We're trying to coordinate getting everyone together.
Ghosties: so you're saying this is one of the worst movies you've ever seen on ALL aspects?
only 16 or so, been a busy week
HANS*
11,01Hi Iain.
7 asses! xD
Humans are evil/10
I dunno. 4.5/10
Ghosties, we all have things that bug us and cause us to dislike certain movies or stories, and that's totally fine, power to ya
I can't seem to get on Stormbluff, for whatever reason. God only knows why it's so popular.
I can't say I like it as much as I loved the original
and I got nothing else for the others from the top of my head :(
At least the lotto's back to normal.
*yawns* guys how can I get more energy? I want to finish brony movie night...
Pony time
wow a lot of awesome people are in this thing
alright/10
Wazoo√Spuddies
it's fine, but it seems more MMOlike
this movie was fast
.nick
TV
and it's a bit... empty
fluttercry: you too, you're saying this is one of the worst movies you've ever watched.
I think it's a case of people going for low pop servers Rei.
huh, I didn't know avril lavigne was in this film.
04I'd have to include that with stuff I've seen like Overdrawn At The Memory Bank, or Space Mutiny
oh hello Nittany_Discord, how ya feeling today?
and then meta
05,15otakon yeah....
I thought it was okay. I still think that How To Train Your Dragon was Better.
whats next?
So-So/10
lol
They Mispronounced PC
OH BOY I LIKE/HATE A MOVIE. LET ME VOICE MY OPINIONS SO THAT EVERYONE CAN BITCH :p
And now they are talking to all o fus
Ghosties: yOU GAVE IT A 2
11,01I'm OK.
also I miss the instanced nature
this kinda true
05,15This was in the same league as Birdemic
dat drawing/10
Y
i use the computer 4 all of those
We can still move as a group as long as server transfers are free and unrestricted.
TV O_O
it let them do patrolling enemies
It's mediocre, very so, like those gasoline station movies you buy
05,15at least I laughed during Birdemic
fluttercry: you are trolling
I need some more energy.
04I'd give Space Mutiny and Overdrawn the same rating
fluttercry: Too wrong.
Hm
maybe now you'll rethink disallowing 6 month old movies.
lol just like god in star trek 2
fluttercry: We should stream that.:D
04Even though Overdrawn had motherfucking Raul Julia
Its okay not to like something but don't be a dick about it
We could always all move to a low-pop server.
KHAAANNN
STAR TREK 2
04And Raul is awesome
11,01Even the end song had bad taste.
Are they in the computer screen!?
and then there was star trek
The porcupine cubs became experts at engineering and turned the forest into a lair Robotnic would drool over
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
fluttercry: seriously Birdemic is horribad
05,15otakon I'm really not trolling. I would have given it up by now.
fluttercry birdempic made me lose faith in humaity
anyone tried WvW yet?
IshBestPony: Agreed.
Exactly. If we were so inclined.
DAMN IT ITS JIM
my server's getting their ass kicked
its fun but not that good /10
fluttercry: you're insane
What movie is after pony?
It's a very shallow movie, but it made good with characters, but no risks.
WHATS NEXT?
Dat unfinished animation
LOl it's funny because Shatner was in Star Trek.
Dirt is pretty good.
We're shredding WvW atm.
I don't believe this
otakon am I trolling?
whoa
Tastes like dirt though
I got a jar of DIrt.
dis awful credit music
Intermission or next movie?
pony_025073: The stare master, then dragon wars, the heart warming's eve.
04Vordox is right, it's just a really shallow movie that I thought was tasteless
Ghosties, fluttercry are rating this super low
>Awful
This is one one of those movie where you are supposed to TURN OFF YOU FUCKJ
Anybody who says this is the worst movie they've seen clearly has NOT seen too many movies... You would not believe the shit I've seen...
WHATS NEXT
I like it, though :<
WvW?
fluttercry: you're allowed to hate it, but may I ask why?
?
dont really care for celeb VAs
dat pica
IshBestPony did you ignore me?
otakon not everyone like what everyone else likes, what I may rate a full score others might rate a 0, and vice versa
"It's a cup of dirt"
Pony episode.
Shucks, I really want to get on Stormbluff right now. Related: maybe that's why it's full?
this song is meh imo
boom
I think he meant MvM
I don't know why I'm complaining about Gentrification. It's brought us nice grocery stores.
CCCP yes
MvM?
World vs World. Guild Wars 2 pvp.
The lotto didn't close yet did it, since you only sent it out a couple hours ago?
I got a jar of Diiiirt! I got a jar of Diiiiiirt! And guess what's inside it!
No, he means WvW.
IshBestPony :'(
Silly otakon.
"Just put an F on that and let me go ho-ome. *chuckles*"
i like the original song better XD
Ghosties: "yes, Vordox is right because he agrees with me" XD
WvWvW if you want to be technical
05,15LunarSS I think the comedy falls completely flat, to the point where it's actually painful
Vivix: even if you don't like it it's not a 2/10
FlutterMEDIC: Dirt?
more swears...
Again it's their opoinion.
This is one one of those movie where you are supposed to TURN OFF YOU FUCKING BRAIN!!!!!
Yeah that's gonna get odd. MvM Mann vs Machine on TF2.
I haven't tried it out yet
Ghosties: But guess what, Life can be shallow too :P
lol
Sudden song chage
Sneaks: brian regan ftw /)
EspyLacopa: DIRT
your a meanie pants IshBestPony
I want to play the game for this movie again.
As I said, I enjoyed watching it ONCE, not wanna see it again.
so what is WvWvW?
CCCP you stinky doody heasd
Ghosties: its what i do ^_^
I refuse to touch PvP until I'm not a noob.
hey FlutterMEDIC
Oh celestia this song
*head
04You're pro, mang
My movie had a much better moral. Lying makes an interesting person.
SpeedyBolt there was a game?
Yeah
DreamWorks problem is too many pop culture references. If they toned it down then it would be fine.
FlutterMEDIC: A jar of derp? are pancakes inside it? :P
Iain: hi
What MLP:FIM episode is next fellow bronies?
it's basically large scale pvp
I'm a human, therefore we all are humans
but, uh
WvW is Guild Wars 2s big pvp games.
Stare NMAste
Stare Master
OH YAH!
Ghosties you guys should have just went with my original choice
Cypresswolf: Dirt. AND IT'S MINE!
they fucked the skill system so bad that it's basically just button spamming
04Probably the worst "A" movie I've ever seen is Hancock though
stare master
I played it all the time on my gamecube.
STARE MASTER FTW!
FlutterMEDIC do you a TF2 account
May i remind the channel that Dreamworks also created How to Train your Dragon.
04God knows I hated Hancock
I thik this movie was average. Not bad, but not good either. I wouldn't mind watching it again, but I would probably do something else while watching it.
what movie is next>'
YEAH
yay i love dat ep
?
Ghosties: that I can agree with
Hancock? Never seen
/me actually reads credits
I have skin. Potatos have sikin. Therefore, I am a potato.
Ghosties: Now THAT is a correct statement
This song is so bad...
Vordox Socrates is a human, therefore socrates is mortal
I dislike most movies I see, but hate few
Ok Ghosties that's your opinion.
Wow I never thought this movie would generate this much hate
factually
11,02Ponies are taking a cartoon too seriously...
Dem AMD Render nodes
not sure why they decided to cut the hundreds of thousands of possible builds down to like six predetermined ones per class
Iain: yes, but i uninstalled it for i'm planning to get a gaming comp
How do you get lost in grocery store?
Ghosties: I still can't see how you find this completely without worth though.
3 servers fighting for territory and resource over massive maps that provide the dominant server with buffs.
Hancock was good, then it devolved in a sitcom.
OohShiny: Too deep for me to understand
oh
Brb guys. I need to check on COD:Black Ops II
04Super, I'm studying to be in the field of anthropology
Ghosties: Wait, Hancock is an A movie?!:O
Just a quick question, BS
Ghosties: Hancock was an A movie? It... really wasnt good.... like at all.
SuperBrony64: I agree
at least it's bloody gorgeous
Ponies are srs bussiness
04So naturally I'm predisposed
this song has the most random lyrics
Does anybody know when Season 3 starts?
05,15I would say that Babes in Toyland was better but....at least I made it all the way through this one
Later Sneaks
god these credits suck
God yes
Ghosties: Anthropology... Sounds...
It's shallow.. but I didn't think it would be anything but.. so it meet all my expectations
can we skip them
This game has art.
Yeah I didn't get that either, I thought the class blender system in GW1 was awesome.
fluttercry: Who picked that movie?
Anthro = human/Animal mix?
SpeedyBolt: Next episode air time is unknown
fluttercry: you're seriously comparing that abomination to this harmless kids' flick
Vordox: yes
fluttercry: okay I know it's not the best movie ever but it's not THAT goddamn bad
04@flutter: wut
I mean, we are treading in artgasm territory here.
I can never show this at all.
04Hell no
Dang.
Class blender?
is dragon wars next?
dual classes
yes
04Babes isn't better than Hancock
Can we watch ponie now?
Anthro is anything humanized Vordox, it means "To humanize" or something
lol just kidding lyrics are weirder.
I just want to watch this channel squirm. *popcorn*
fluttercry: rya serious?
05,15No no you're reading that wrong, Babes is still worse
Elit3xPon3: Pony episode.
plz be over
In GW1 you could be multiple classes at once.
Babes in toyland and epic movie are both banned in Bronystate.
fluttercry: This was that bad? Glad I missed most of it
we needs ponies here.
don't blame the winner. He picked Hugo /me blames the mods.
IshBestPony but if you hugged poor me you would make me happier
tomorrow, can we at least play something else over the credits?:P
Vivix: So basically, Freaky stuff :P
04Ah, okay
Everypony Keep calm and wait for Ponies
Babes was WMC.
Kawaii_icybeauti: It is?
CCCP nope
of Furryism I prefer feral
I like GW2 well enough, I just keep feeling like in six months I'll drop it and go back to GW1 again
Keep calm and watch ponies.
Babes in Toyland was WMC'd because the colors caused headaches, right?
Well that's just awesome.
Babes is not even worse, its in its own dimension of bad
Ghosties: I dislike your occupation
Guys, just quit complaining
Babes was 2.5 hours long.
Vivix: we're not talking about that
Hey just out of curiosity does anybody here have a very special somepony? :P
AJIsAwesome: Yup. They both can never be played again.
04Lol, okay Vordox
IshBestPony how about in a pm?
That's just silly
goddammit
/me hugs CCCP
04Whoa whoa
I havent had one, never had one
04I never said that
and i'm still happy...
This movie isn't great but at least it was well made with good actors
I'll probably stick with GW2 tbh.
CCCP you get no hugs
Remember Chitty from Edihiran.
okay the hell is a feral furry?
-sniffle-
/me huggies IshBestPony
also god these credits are bad
so only on april fools day>
this song, is bullshit horrible
>_> Why is it still the same song?

Ghosties: Oh?

A feral furry is a crazy guy who lives in the woods dressed as a bear/bigfoot?

My Cutie Mark: A television
dat blank flank
Sumica: How long did it take you to make your OC desktop's animations?
hush now quiet now
04Yeah, sorta
WHAT NOW
Dammit, Stormbluff Isle is just too popular.
Again, I think a Feral Furry is a dude in a Bear/Bigfoot costume scaring the shit out of Tourists
Vivix: anthropology is the study of human/animal mixes.
04Anthropology is the study of human culture and various things
...
00,10I' did not make it, Vordox did
ohh- hm
okay we can move on now
Sumica: Ok.
Sounds a lot funnier that way.
WHAT NOW- son
Look it's the cat from Over the Hedge
wrong sort of Anthro
Fluttershy can throw her yays
Antrhopology.... Took that cllass, loved it... but still don't have any idea what it was about... got a minor in sociology though.

That actually sounds very interesting-
We are not moving on, otakon.

the sexual proclivities of fringe elements do not really interest me

otakon: furries aren't all into the sexual proclivities though. Just like not all bronies are int, well, you know
I asked ONE question

Never attempt to threaten the issue.
Opal does NOT like her mane... :(
pony.avi
Or I will destroy you.
05,15You can talk about furries, just don't get graphic
This is all your fault, otakon.

Pale_Horse wow that was perfect
fluttercry: oops

That's a sexy blanket
You began this, otakon. Now you have to see it through.

longneck.....
awwww poor sweetie belle
nope
of course
SKEWTALEW, APULBLEWM
gotta go guys
Applebloom!
I feel your pain Sweetie Belle.
Anyway
Fluttershy's colors are a bit strange in this episode
CMC theme....
APPLEBLOOM
Ghosties, you want to explain it a bit or not really the place? Chat is a bit fast
soooo Guild wars suspended digital sales
RAWRity: well true, i guess in a sense I'm a furry since I like the MLP characters and grew up on Disney, which uses a LOT of anthro characters
Technically bronies are furries, I guess?
APPLEBLOOM APPLEBLOOM APPLEBLOOM APPLEBLOOM APPLEBLOOM
SpeedyBolt, why did I laugh so hard
Applebloom Applebloom
yeah
applebloom applebloomm
dat theme
CUTIE MARK CRUSADER SLEEPOVER AT RARITY'S!!!
YAY

YAY
normaly fluttershy's coat is a bit lighter
<--- Dat ALWAYS reminds me of that part Danfango ytp
dat face :D
OohShiny: How exactly?
dat royal canterlot voice.
depends, reall.
Apple Bloom!
no thanks
Because your mind had a sudden blankout
all night loooong
THE CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS!!!
YAY
it's basically liking antrho characters
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS
yay
Depends on how you define a furry.
so much yellling
yay.
YAY
Scoot-a-looo Scoot-Scootaloo!!!!
ITS SUMERPAN
omg
whether clean or riske
*fluttershy* NO!
That was quick sewing
Uh oh
Sooo much.. yay
That YAY
AAAAAAAAAAAA OAO
oh pony
05,15I swear to god we watched this episode last week
oh shi
*risqué
ah snap
do you enjoy ponies for the characters, or just for the idea of talking equines?
........................
YAY
Well, ponies are technically furries since they are technically athropomorphic, they have human qualities, just not physically.
fluttercry: we did
Dat terror
RAWRity: characters
like the scare cords
fluttercry at least it's not party of one for the billionth time
dat drama
MEDIC!! WE NEED MORE GOLD SILK!!!!
fluttercry: SB streamed it during this week i think
ping
WHAT?
SQUEAK
SQUEAK!
Dat voicebreak
ah deep conversation
Wh*crack*at?
ha! :D
otakon: then it's not really a "furry" thing by my judgment.
It was like less than a minute to sew
I enjoy ponies for the fluid animation and the gags, honestly
Man. Gold and jewels must be as common as mud in Equestria. :P
when did she make the silk thingys oO
BAD GIRL SWEETIEBELL
DISTRAIGHT
i fucking love rarity
Fack you Rarity
Dat cutting right in the middle of the fabric instead of off the sides.
^
taht too
*distraught
them faces :)
reminds me of the good ol cartoon network days
loe Rarity too
It's you fault anyway
the animation is great
love
rarity
Dem smiles.
late Applebloom reaction
she's right...
Pale_Horse seems that way
dat Pong
I enjoy ponies in a childish way.
AlienWarhead: Depends on the rarity of the material needed to make it.
sweetie belle's voice alwas cracks
some people have some sort of rage-boner about the gags
?
lol the CMC = creatures
scootaloo approves
Basically, if you'd be fine watching this show with a human cast, then it's nothing really to do with the anthropomorphized part.
CUTIE MARK CRUSADER SLEEPOVER AT FLUTTERSHY'S COTTAGE!!!
angels!
Ponies make me smile. I need no other reason to like them.
how so DSNesmith?
dem Halos
YAY
:) Those halos
YAY
RAWRity: eeyup
if the episode isn't about deep character development, they think it's plebiean garbage
CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS SLEEPOVER AT FLUTTERSHY'S COTTAGE
so cute
IT'S A TRAP!
:)
Iain that's what I find cute about here
EARDRUMS ARE GONE
Pale_Horse: they are, considering that i estimate that, by Earth standards, Equestria must be in the late 1800s-early 1900s
too vute
Oh god yes
cute
The Worst Ep convos.
They just used the royal Canterlot voice
YAY
for some reason these people are largely rainbow dash fans
ever so fun
DSNesmith: then...they must hate every damn episode.
pony_300: Cutie mark creatures
DSNesmith: good lord that's SRS BIZNESS
RAWRity: I don't really know why, but I don't think I would have liked this show as much if it was with humans... and I definitely wouldn't clop to it. I'm a furry, I prefer non-humans.
and fluttershy colors is normal again
yes OohShiny
hey they do braid tails
Hi random Encounter.
gotta go fast
Lol Fluttershy is fiiiiiiinnnnnee
fluttercry: Errr.... mixed with areas really
AJIsAwesome We do see a lot of gems in the show, but the show doesn't talk about metals a lot
Fluttershy is me. the CMC are all my friends.
Bjornfot: whatever floats your boat
Bjornfot: well aren't you open...but I forget who are you..
MI9000: VERY carefully
dat music
MrPine23: I know the feel brah
why hello twilight
one moment please
Humans are soooo manestream!
*who you are
Bjornfot's the guy who gets nearly banned every week
let me find something I found while moving my computer
lol
twilight twilight!
poor fluttershy going in way over her head
You know the Everfree Forest.. that no one ever goes into... except everyone of us.
Dat pink hair
AlienWarhead: Technically, we shouldn't really question a tv show.:D
Eat little angels.
FlutterMEDIC, yeah, around that time + random bits of tech. Pretty neat, no TV's...letters abundant, torchlights- ah lovely
i love twilight..................sparkle :3
Twilight is best pony. Just saying
Oh hooray
EEYUP
Fluttershy is best foal-sitter
sweet my...

OohShiny: Not really
all i see is a tree, a marshmellow, a dictionary, and a chicken
PONIES!!!!!!!!! :D
AJIsAwesome :$
I hope this is something to scar otakon. His reactions are priceless.
EVERYPONY IS BEST PONY and stop with that INSERT PONY is BEST PONY! :X
DERP
[02:38] == StinkomanFan [ffvpvcmwud@387-48-53-16.client.mchsi.com] has quit [Remote host closed the connection] [02:38] <Reikim> Oh hooray
This is going to tramutize Fluttershy.
IM GUNNA GET MY MARK FIRST!
:P
mitamaking didn't say she was good in working as a foal-sitter
She'll never have kids at this point.
AlienWarhead: It's okay.:)
Fluttershy will now never have Foals of her own
dat hair
Not related.
reikim you meanie~
drat I seem to have deleted it
hair animation
I can't even see that.
Stuff
emo hair
why Stinko leav?
Ikr Michael
Using popped-out browser IRC, I can't even see that.
oh hey, let me check my history. I might still have that skunk picture emangamer was always posting a while back.
suffice it to say I walked into the wrong IRC room
forest is not scary enough
RAWRity: um what kind is it?
Everfree Forest is like the Forest in Harry Potter.
CUTIE MARK CRUSADER CREATURE CATCHERS!!!
Oh, one of my very favorite episodes.
Like ursa majors.
DSNesmith: What was it?
POKEMON!
dat face
WHICH IS BETTER!?
they could be mini turtlemen.
pony erp
dat monster
That is why I live very close to the forest
havent seen that for months
04Rawr
GOTTA CATCH'EM ALL!
CMC YAY OR FLUTTERSHY YAY?
omg
RAAAWR!
What.
No.
Its dangerous to go alone. Take this Fluttershy.
Rawar!
YAY
SHOW ME YOUR WARFACE
otakon: Fluttershy yay.
I love Fluttershy's face
lol
Wait, yes. otakon's reaction would have been gold.

flutteryay is best yay
Fluttershy yay
Sweetie Bell is slow... XD
NO! :[

I love it when Sweetie Belle puts on her war face.
05,15CMC Monster Hunters yay!
RAAWR

Where's her pokeballs?
Claire collett is the youngest from the cmc right?

CMC POKEMON MASTERS YAY!
She's doing it like Ash.
04Yeah, I think she's like 13?
yea
rawr
Capture without Pokeballs
Fluttershys inside: BITCH I SAID SIT DOWN
Who does Claire Collett voice? Sweetie Bell?
she has plenty of ram, but a bad processor
The CMC are all foals.
I think it's funny that sweetie bells voice actress plays minecraft
I have to turn alerts off of one chat since some of the occupants decide to suddenly have "fun" in their
omg
yea
Kandarihu: yep
there*
Hammer.
hammer
Hammer.
I love how they break the table and cant fix it... yet... they can completely fix up the tree house no problem!
CMC aren't foals. Foals are infants.
Couldn't applebloom actually be a carpenter?

Too many cooks

Klumzeedragon: Technically it's Applebloom.
ART
or did they
Why do you need a stethoscope to do carpentry?
jackhammers too
hammer
seems legit
Misery.
and to think Applebloom is actually a GOOD Carpenter
Hm?
It's a jack HAMMER
MI9000: beacuse the other two fillies were involved
In which chat?
its modern art
Apple bloom builds a treehouse....messes up table...
Foals are.. up to six months old, right?
octavia or whatever
HALT! HAMMERZAIT!
That table needs to be condemned
I now imagine Fluttershy having a ridiculously agressive voice in her head sort of like Inner Sakura from naruto. :P
dat table
up to a year.
wait
Klumzeedragon: the house was made by applebloom alone.
I see. She's a very talented actress, but there's obviously some good voice direction here.
its shhhh
Or, well... I don't actually identify myself as a "furry" any more (I just enjoy furry art), the fandom is pretty horrible and I don't think I'm an animal or some crazy shit like that. I didn't even have a fursona. I only got a little deep into all of that shit because I had a less than healthy obsession with Lucario... I almost got myself a freaking fursuit. Almost. Don't judge me.
I was told that was the chatters.
shhh
kept trying to get people to talk about her ass
inb4 squee
I would

Hey, you leave Octavia alone. She had the finest plot this side of the milky way.
squeee
BEST SOUND EVA!!!! 1

05,15RP always gets out of hand
whoa, you expect me to read all that
That squee is my ping sound
I lose
Klumzeedragon: Plus they were all working on the table at once, instead of Applebloom doing it herself.
Bjornfot: I will not judge
I lost the game
Yes otakon, ask Nitt. Or don't, it's kind of creepy.
The squee of the gods
kempa: AGREED
NO!

Oh wait
Instantly clean

speaking of jokes that people take seriously
yes
dat minecraft
Wasnt there a song in this episode?
I just found the Godfather chat logs
like?
yaaaaaay
how long do horses live?
coal miners?
Anyway, I was told that it was the chatters making fun of Octavia's plot.
This episode spawned so many sound clips. :P
NO
DSNesmith: Godfather chat?
and scootaloo
anyone remember that
SpeedyBolt: Wait for it
SpeedyBolt: It's coming up
No otakon, I am not sharing this.
hush now incoming
flutterMEDIC hey dude... Great to see someone is agreeing with me :D

Horses aren't the exact same as ponies though right?

Hush now, Quiet now~

/me feels sleepy
Horses and ponies are the exact same species, but different breeds
TACTICAL SONG INBOUBD
badas lulaby
Here's my theory. Years on the planet that FiM takes place on are much shorter than Earth years.
you do NOT bring it up if you don't share it
Hush now. . .
Those sleepy faces <3 <3
dat damn song
:):):)
dat voice

I got a little hat though. It has ears and stuff. https://d.facdn.net/art/lucariley/1295390604.lucariley_110118-233544.jpg

Fluttershy is STILL better than Neville Chamberlain.

darn i love this part
RAWRity: the Hetalia fandom?
awwww shit
dat voice hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggg
Hey look otakon, I'm stronger than you, I'm moving on from this.
Hit it, Sweetie!
Klumzeedragon: Well, they are kids. They want what they can't really have, and they haven't matured enough to know that.
I am not going to click that
HUSH NOW QUIET NOW
/me JUMPS
Vivix: Mature enough to breed responsible? Is that a thing among real horses in some way?
It became a running joke that Octavia had the most gargantuan of plots and she was happy enough to roll with it.
dat smile
:S
Sweetie Belle is taking us to MOTOWWWNNNN
I just had an orgasm..
once more SimGretina remix infects me
AND NOW SOUL TRAIN
/me dances
05,15dat hat
it got out of hand though
YES
Bjornfot: I like the hat
/me loves Gossiple music <3
preach the gospel sister!
Reikim: dammit man don'
This was before we had rules about being out of hand.
dat volume
ITS A FEMALE MJ
Please ignore the V sign.
RainbowAsh, not naturally I think, but breeding 2 yearolds is considered unhealthy for the mare, since she's still growing- or something
Kirusaki_Pony: eargasm
Sweetie Belle is Gloria Estefan
*gospel
So we all know Sweetie's cutie mark is music right
Dancing poni at the corner
Ow!
And yet, she cant find her talent
04Dance it out, Sumi
Reikim: do not bring it up if you don't intend on sharing it
^
mfw Bjornfot reminds me of one of my friends.
00,10nah
Meanwhile: technically this is WHY we have those rules now
see the problem is that if you act ironically
she should get a fat black women.
Ghosties: :D
WE AT CHURCH PRAISE THE LORD
WHOA
omg Fluttershy sheed!
dang they fast
they are fast
If rawrity is talking about what I think he is then its a fandom that is 99% fujoshi
dat sister got soul
mitamaking: Everyone does...except Sweetie Belle
That's your siblings Scootaloo
Vivix, ah, I see. Thanks for clarifying. ^^
people who take you seriously will join
WHOA
o.o;
Scoots
OW!
One of my favourite things to do at the time was motorboat her plot.
So many Scootaloo.
inb4 they say "asshole"
nice timing
nah I was talkin' bout applejack
otakon: I was explaining that Maid Hour got out of hand. That was all I was required to share. You're the one pressing for details.
It's hard to say how long MLP ponies live. Regular ponies only live a few decades but Equestira has good medical technology and working magic. And we humans ourselves live about 3 times longer than we "should".
00,10scoot lost her wings again
oh, right, godfather chat
and since chat suddenly exploaded I'll repeat: Pony is a height classifications as far as I remember, so ponies are horses- I don't think there's much of an lifelength difference
scootaloo hearding scootaloo
catch scootaloos family
Reikim: okay
nobody remembers that?
somepony call AJ
hey, its a chicken
Sumica: You times that well!

scootaloo: chillin' with my homeboy
OBEY!
OBEY
so many Scootaloos
so we all thought the godfather was dreadful
it's coming
STARE
Scoot-scootalo hearders! YAY!
dat stare!
I think MLP Ponies are humanized enough that 80-90 years would be assumable-
YOU SHALL DIE IN AGONY!
DAT LOOK
hypnoshy...
PENANCE STARE
O_O
EEp
So AB is the willpower but has trouble with leading. Sweetie Bell is slower then usual but has creativity, And scoot we ALREADY know>.>
look at Granny Smith
11,02Rave|Gym: I don't stream pony episodes that are going to be streamed at that week's BMN :)
00,10see no wings
Fluttershy's got Jedi Power
and one chicken
stare time
I still don't know why people like it
MIND FUCK
dat stare
BUT
RAWRity: okay I'll admit I like it.
The stare haunts my nightmares
Fluttershy has PSYCHIC POWAS
05,15The Godfather is fantastic
She gave them the googly eye
AlienWarhead: LOOK INTO MY EYES!
RAWRity: i would hit that with the force of a thousand suns.
fail scootalo
I couldn't even pay attention after the first 20 minutes
party soft
Scootaloo has no wings
04These are not the chickens you were looking for
I've never seen it.
PARTY SOFT
were are wings!
Party Soft!
That wingless Scoot.
One of the chickens is still out!
it was just italians mumbling
use the FORCE!
Dont break a Pinkie Promise
I'm sure they'd live 80-90 years, if the years are really short.
lol Ghosties
Bjornfot: what about Minerva Mink :P
WE LIED!
wonder where that sting comes from?
And Fluttershy has to sleep on her couch
seriously
no thanks?
er
EYES
hush now
I mean it wasn't a BAD movie
wait no that's not it
Fluttershy should be able to tame Scootaloo, on account of that she's a chicken
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
so many legendary jokes from season 1

great, now its a chicken, a dictionary, and a marshmellow
They wouldn't be Earth years
it was just boring
inb4 overused Scootaloo joke
Or perhaps their lifespan is closer to human, since they clearly -aren't- regular horses.
Anyway, RAWRity: stop trying to make me a furry, you're coming dangerously close to success.
NONONONO
I don't need explosions but I do need characters I care about
Kandarihu, if you look at Granny we can guess that age- even if we got no indication, but real horses are not as long lived
Kandarihu: i doubt the years are really short. because a foal is able to speak after its one moth old.
What would that cutie mark be?
Reikim: I was just sharing a pertinent picture is all.
oh otakon, you dirty...
Maybe Scootaloo's special talent is that she's secretly got cockatrice powers. :O
I remember there is a chart
They're so humanized that we can assume they have our lifelength
anyway, we were watching the euro stream
MrPine23 so Twilight could handle Sweetie Belle? Because she's a dictionary and all?

the infants using magic and flying might go under "magic bursts and uncontrolled stuff" they mentioned, like how infants can swim, but children can't unless they kept up the training

I wish the CMC would wear their capes again.,
does that octopus have teeth
But they'll put a dick move on us and cut the screen off before we see it
Kandarihu: scoot is a special case in flying i think. either a very late bloomer or incabable
So I heard you like Helicopter?
Pale_Horse: they do that, and the world will spontaneously combust, then implode

SCOOT IS CHIKEN LOLOLOLOLOL
SuperBrony64, I never noticed that. And yet this is the episode that launched that dumb meme.
Here it comes
otakon, hotlinking to fj does not work
And of course the infamous scene in 3...2...1..
Chicken.
and so a legend was born
CHICKEN
SCOOTALOO
SCOOTALOO!!! SCOOT - SCOOTALOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Scootaloo! Scoot-Scootaloo!
A meme is born
Not to mention, Fideli is a weird word

There are so many things wrong with that octopus.
otakon: Where's the "None" option?

Yeah otakon. Find it again, port it to tinypic or something, then show us.

What would a arguing cutie mark look like?

SCOOTALOO NOODLE SOUP
I do not find the frontpage of funnyjunk attractive.

CMC Lawyers!
Kirusaki_Pony: is too
how would you even represent argueing with a cutie mark?
where is SB btw?
That's not arguing, that's just being contradictory.
OH GOD THE CEPHALOPODS ARE EVOLVING
xD
I really don't ike how the fandom always, always, always, without fail, predictably equeates Scoot with poultry. :/
Eek!
scootaloo is best chicken
MrPine23: a pony head yelling?
The genius of the show is that the CMC aren't annoying.
MrPine23: 2 ponies with pissed faces and their mouths open..
MrPine23: Beurocracy
MrPine23: Internet flame war.
MrPine23, 4chan logo
I don't understand how such a great meme originated from such a bland origin.
Dat screAM
Cutie Mark Gainsayers! YAY!
MrPine23: The youtube commet section
too much squeaks

Fou_Lou, it seems that normal pegasi have to be enrolled in special training to fly safely.
arguing cutie mark would be phonix wright
Scootaloo is best orange chicken
obligatory stoned jokes
DocSane, YES! Kids are usually always annoying
It doesn't actually have teeth though, that's just the way the inner part of its mouth is shaped.

Twilight almost died in this episode. Totally ignored
/me is not surprised in the least by Bjornfot's respnse
XD
Er, okay. So it's not special training if every pony of a particular race is required to go through it.
you know
DAT STONE JOKE
DON'T MOVE
Don't...move...
lol
Of the examples they give I dont really like any of them
CrimsonPhoenix: bravo, you done earn 9001 internet points
Like a lawyer.
a gorgon or a medusa could turn things to stone too
and a fox news cutie mark appears
lol
Alright, get a gold needle.
Arguing Cutie Mark: Gavel
looks like Twi *puts on shades* got stoned "YEEEAAAH!"
Alchemist: LOLOLOL
Any pony could die, and none of the remaining mane 6 would notice.

Silly Cock
Oh crap
10% for me is the limit

Kandarihu: Fly safely maybe. but fly at all should be possible for every pegasi without any special training.
Unless you're Fluttershy, then you can stare them down.
lol
lolol
Do not look a cock in the eye!
04Well, the girls are kinda the next generation
now for the MLP version: http://derpy.me/VxoBC
Never look a cockathingy in the eye.

That cock is hard to catch
04So it makes sense
2 scoota-loos
/me uses Scan Visor. |v
And then Twi would be terribly depressed that she lost her best friends about two months after making them.
Or, to FULLY phoneticize it, kok-ah-triss

Otakon better learn to go super saying if he wants to stand a chance against freezer.
Meanwhile: dari does not like the 11th :d

This D-War sounds terrible! D:

GONDOR...ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
There it is

DSNesmith: eeyup
You have to be shitting me.
Sergio_Scriptor: I know this, which is why I'm telling him.
I broke my tibia once. By tripping over a ball. It was embarrassing.
it was even more soul-crushing the second time
Vordox: It iiiiis!
numbah 12?
I think it would get WMC nowadays though
is the drawing during Euro Movie Night?
DIDN'T THEY FUCKING RUIN WEEPING ANGELS ENOUGH LAST TIME?
WHY?!
No they did not.
WMC gets called too often
hehe
hi Derpy
Now there are baby ones.
WHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!?!?
I imagine the Chat had too much fun with battlefield Earth to bring in WMC anyway
sorry guys im just excited here
only a few have really deserved it
Huh DaringDerpy ?
Fuck's sake.
WMC has been callede /twice/.
Dari?
I can hear Shizuka yelling "LEVERAGE" from here
coughbabesintoylandcough
Reikim: three times
lol
I think we broke dari
Dari just heard 4 knocks
What did i miss?
What? A third?
first time I saw weeping angels in..Tennant, was greaaat, until they were rocking the Tardis back and forth in the basement, then I just lost it
WMC is when something is so awful the chat can't even make it entertaining.
0,14WMC was after Battlefield Earth
epic movie was also pretty horrendous, but I dunno if it was WMC
sliding Derpy
and now I leave! I shall return and bring with me a peacful chat!

I was wondering I've never seen Doctor Who before, does anyone know if anyone will stream it?
Meanwhile: touche
spider's web
I missed spider's web, sadly
technically, somebody could request Spider's Web and they'd ahve to show it at least once.
Rookeealding: Go to Netflix
dat EQD link is exactly why we need Applejack song
oh yeah, D-War isn't WMC material
2 livestreams, I CANT HANDLE IT
he made goood episodes
There's someone here who streamed it a lot before, but dunno
Spiders Web was shit.
DSNesmith: "Sadly"
Rookeealding: we do, but its random
Dari's doing his fluttercry during Over The Edge impression
it's an absolutely shit movie, but its' hilariously so
Netflix is not available everywhere
hell
Indian fikkin Stallone
But not so shit it was WMC'd.
look its the buffer show guys
Dat Indian Stallone...
I'm going to watch this series despite never having seen Dr. Who
Spider's Web isn't even ON the list
Er, Over The Hedge
lol
it was expunged
I meant the new ewpsode tommoreow night... and I don't have netflix
If I recall though, it /was/ WMC'd briefly, but was countermanded.

"It can be shown again"
0,14he picked Epic Movie
OH GOD WHY!?
MUFFINS!
So, guys, I was watching the older Doctor Who, and I have one question: Would you like a jelly baby?
yay!
0,14and wasn't there
you know, technically WMC only applies to official streams, right? So technically, a mod COULD stream Babes in Toyland on their own time if they wanted...
All the muffins!
literally, BIT was my #1 worst film
Babes in Toyland. A moment of silence for chatters lost.
Shame I won't be bale to watch it, I wanna watch it with my dad so I have to wait for it on Comcast
String_Shredder: the candy?
05,15I still don't know how the Nostalgia Critic could say Babes in Toyland wasn't that bad
heh i love you guys
Yeah Applejack! Woo hooooo!
Clearly he's an inbred backwater pigfucker.
Clock is Ticking!!!
anypony play maplestory by chance?
fluttercry: he said it was bad, but it was an entertaining type of bad for him.
Moopy: we love you too :)
Dose Infinite Depths...
My client colours my own chat, I feel like a fake mod
String_Shredder: I actually have a scarf I got that is made to look like his
FlutterMEDIC: Yes, the candy. Would you like a jelly baby?
Will is best staff

Herostar: GigabitHampster does, ask him about it

String_Shredder: yes

Sumica: BUT! A foolish samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me!
05,15Dari I have a feeling you're going to love this movie
Ugh.

Wrek: ............
every time the protagonist changes his facial expression, take a shot
0,14man, all the dirty jokes that could be made with D
Ghosties: No "Long ago in a distant land" ?
Dragon Wars! So this will be a ripoff of Star Wars.
Wrek: i can't view it, i'm too young apparently ;_;
Damn, in media res much?
That is all
WAIT, I KNOW. It sounded similar to Zecroa. Only not.
lol Hammy actor.
wait, no
I already hate this
crazy hobo, fantastic
Derp Wars
every scene he appears in
We should watch the Animated Dragonlance movie
Dragons are just a myth!
Warning: I'm probably going to enjoy this movie in a cheesy sort of way.
and has this expression
is he a pirate?
WMC number 3 might be here before us
take a shot
D-War? wow
Dragons in sapce?
im just gonna be loli ng through this whole movie XD
I am hating it more
RosePetal, because it has the word "Wars" in the title?
looking good already
more like D-bag wars
Ghosties: lol
Apperantly so.
Looking promising
err mah gerrd
The hate levels!
hammyness within the first minute of the movie...this is going to be a long movie
DEY HAVE AWOKEN
Was just assuming.
Ghosties: I nearly spit out my coffee at that line
doh
"I forgot which order my lines go in"
Its so bad, Ghosties has resorted to making jokes about it to give it hope
FlutterMEDIC: it IS a long one
From the title it sounded like an anime
dat acting
You don't have a tie! So YOU CAN'T BE HERE!
seriously this guy's face
is made of wood
otakon: OH GOD NO
and then he absorbed a soul
00,10man that camera has a great zoom
JESmith: it's a korean movie
how much did it take to make this movie?
/me turns off his brain
Wow, that security is incompetent.
this guy's face is made of wood
scale
Why did we not want Rifftrax here?
Who could have caused this?
dragon scale
DSNesmith: he's almost as good as the guy i Birdemic
otakon: I know that know
AlienWarhead: bc
05,15He's covered wars you know?
oh god
*in
it's not quite that bad
"I've covered wars you know."
Wow, that camera has super zoom vison.

Backstory? NOOOOOPE
This is a sequel?

the middle 2/4 of this movie
Can you explain where you saw this before?
he is Dovakin!
Half?
THE HELL MOVIE
your a dragonborn, harry
is a flashback within a flashback
he looks like Tom Cruise
well
That is the ugliest woman ever.
wtf...
the "middle half" sounds weird
04That is no Frank West
Fifteen years?
That's a guy.
twilight_sprinkle: thats funny
That...is a long time
otakon bc?
No backstory? This is going to be the greatest movie ver!
WHY DID WE NOT START HERE!
04Frank West is 20 times the man he is
He's not ugly though
15 years later.
DSNesmith: just say the 2nd act
05,15Wait....this really is a flashback...2 minutes into the film?
you know what we need? the Nostalgia Critic to critic this movie
oh yeah
Ethan.
He's covered wars, you know. But does he know why kids like Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
Goddammit WHY DID WE NOT START AT THIS POINT?
FLASH BACKKKKKK
where's the plot?
Well that's stupid.
no touchy ze tralala
Ethan Mars?
"You break it, you buy it, asshole."
I knew it.
When did this movie come out?
get ready for assloads of flashbacks folks
Kandarihu: :D
MrBen: :D

At least The Sorcerer's Apprentice started when he was a KID
Oh no.... Flashbacks.
Harry potter?
Does it really have that many flashbacks?
Oh no.
and then fast forwarded
I'm back! So, how is this movie?
should i be watching this movie ?
just wait till we meet the female lead
erm, where is this guy familiar from?
Is this worse than Reign of fire? Because that would be quite a feat
more flashbacks than Naruto
I've seen more convincing pornstars
you don't start in the present that BACKTRACK
00,102fiddy
plz no one spoil this movie. I want to be surprised
According to the chat, Bad.

04I hate you >:I
the dragons are actually big snakes
celestia
God this guy is a shitty storyteller.
DSNesmith: they're atypical Chinese style dragons, long and serpent like
Nah you don't.
Mugi Boogie.
I wouldn't buy this shit for two pence.
inb4 celestia
they're not chinese style though
whoa...wait a minute....what is this movie
Old guy wants the kid to touch his emoogi
gift of the Pikachu
Uwe Jew?

they are literally giant cobras
Celestia?

this is confusing me more than explaining
A Weegee?

Hell, I wouldn't buy this shit for half a yen.
I want to be a pony~

GigabitHarmonie: is your show today?

ANOTHER FLASHBACK
celestail dragon! Celestia
WITHIN A FLASHBACK
0,14YO DAWG
1507?
485 years ago
That's right, just SHOVE all that mythology in the first five minutes. Not like we have a whole MOVIE to just slowly dish it out
Special effects.
Wait, is this really the story?
A FLASHBACK WITHIN A FLASHBACK
Sounds like a bad Okami parody......
0,14I HERD U LIEK FLASHBACKS
THE FUCK
So this movie was made in 2007
Everlasting_Joy: Thank you. Now you got me thinking of the Weegee stare.
00,10his name is harro?
BronyInstrumental: Tomorrow night, think Saturday. :)
05,15So I herd u liek flashbacks
FLASHBACKS ERRYWHERE
Flashback within a Flashback Within a Flashback/
Flashback in a Flashback
it's flashbackception

I told you
Is it just me or is the stream laggy?
CHING CHONG!
04HARRO?
Heaven is pathetic
Sumica Harro Sumica :)
why does this remind me of that one dragon of what was it> Adventure Tales with that large ridable dragon
FLASHBACKCEPTION
04THIS IS HARRO SPEAKING
This movie needs Ip man at this rate
/me tosses a brick at otakon

Ninjangos?!
He's ded but smiling.
ching chong!
Ah forget it!
Poot better actors here!
First Baracki trips the CMCs, now this
A ninja did it
I think there is a law that says you can;t have flaskback inside of flashbacks. I think they put you in a sack and beat you with reeds if you break it. :(
00,03 You just have to assume that they are talking like they are in despair!
00,10odd
GigabitHarmonie: okay then, thanks. i might be able to catch it then, seeing as school starts for me in a few days and, as much as i hate to say it, i need to actually pay attention in classes, so no 5AM-bedtime nights for me ;_;
Did he say Kim?
05so much hate on my new image
05i do wonder why
It's an asian dumbledore
ooooooo
Wrek: what new image? may I see?
perhaps it's the borderline porn
Wrek people have no open mind
04I bring you your daily tribute of M&Ms, grand leader
What is this about?
05,15Wrek which one?
My lord, please listen
Wrek: Because people are crybabies, you did a good job.
I'm not even following the plot anymore, and I managed to struggle through RahXephon! (Granted, RahXephon actually played fair.)
Wrek: The Cherrilee one?
Wrek: Wat image?
One in every 5 words of what he's saying I understand
Okay, seriously
051 sec otakon ill link you
otakon: DOnt do it
RosePetal: Maybe. The name Kim is like Smith in the US
she will be sacrificed to the imoogi
Wrek: i can't view your new image i'm "too young" ;_;
i really want to say Ching Chong, but i dont know if you guys will allow it
So let me get this straight. There once existed people able to transform into dragons.
BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH
There are yen ben da ko mo cma.

dammit, I don't speak ching chang
otakon I wouldn't go through that link
04IS HARRO
this is useful
CHING CHONG
it's furry porn
Also, the film would have been better if it started with the FLASHBACK first THEN fast forwarded to present day
damn, he's high
There I said it.

They're probably just speaking gibberish and hoping it sounds like Korean
dat buffer
Someone screen capture this!!!!
The entire movie's plot is being explained right now. Problem?
I'm assuming what just happened, happened in manechat, because God knows it didn't happen here.

05,15harro
It is?
I think Sumica stopped the stream...
I bet they are actually talking about women.
roughly translated to ""The Secret of Bronystate Gold MUST NOT BE REVEALED"
GigabitHarmonie: technically for me, your show IS today. just in about 20 hours :)
Because I am so fucking confused right now.

Caught in a landslide

I feel so bad for Sam.
also "the fat greasy guy gets laid, so my fans can too"
goddamit, I just realised its september now
I've only read the first book. I liked it.
I hate what he's done with Sam
or rather, not done
it's been like 2000 goddamn pages

Sam has not grown up yet.

Where was Gondor when http://i.imgur.com/Jaw1w.jpg
school is starting that gives me less time with everypony!!!
CALM YO TITIES
fluttercry: I figured as much
panic!!
Ghosties, now there's a non-issue. :D
Sorry. You did not say this.
In the beginning, God made the universe. This made a lot of people very angry and was widely regarded as a Bad Move.
Sansa had a clear-cut arc
Hey DSNesmith, read Wheel of Time, then complain about your characters doing shit all.
Ghosties, my nips ar hard
Fluttercry: Ahhhh.
Iain: CALM.YOUR.TITS!
Its japs, not nips
Where are the old mods like RainBroDash and DCD?

Thus the Nostalgia Critic was born.
instead
Are we all still buffering?
it not September here on the East Coast for another 2.5 hours
So THAT'S why the film stopped.
Sansa is really frustrating. I hate fans that like to watch her suffer, though.
she has developed almost none at all
Spazturtle: Gone.
Goddammit Meanwhile. I'm calling Hax
I dont get it
HARRO BUFFER, I like that. :D
Meanwhile wow you guys are fast
oh
Spazturtle: well Rainbro and DCD don't come on that often anymore
Meanwhile: BRILLIANT!
The film stopped or something.
and is still the same person she was in book one
That's why I stick to simpler titles for my fantasy reading. Like HPATHBP and TWWRLAM and PJATBOTL and TSA:AHTOCT
I'm lost my head hurts
Luna used to stream cartoons, I miss her streams
Open your eyes
Vivix: me too man
:(
Look up to the skies and seeee
Not gonna be September here for at least another 3 and a half hours over here!
lol oktakon

"Hahaha, she's so dumb". SHE HAS NO AGENCY BECAUSE OF HER SEX.
This aint MeowCeption. We got some real technical problems

well, not technical, but you know what i mean
/me blasts Anamanaguchi to the entire chat
She is the very epitome of an airhead.
but she continued to be useless
So... Hows the rumor mill lately? Have there been any good ones?
....so! Why don't we play Charades to pass the...oh, wait. Damn.
otakon: Yeah, telling the masses that'll really help.
Und Meanwhile once again proves that he is the master of the buffer cap

I would be fine with Sansa if she weren't so freaking stupid. She literally lives in dreamland. Granted, this is probably intentional.

Storm of Swords hit me in the gut.

AlienWarhead, but it already is.
Yes, we need to make buffering a meme!
storm was just nuts
oh man
reikim
We need more dragons!
Already did it.
So what movies are you all going to stream on Halloween?
when you finish it
dammit I can't find any of the other GoT books myself
we're here for you
if you need to talk
Alright. Cats are fed.
I've only finished the first book
SUMERPAN.
Reikim: She's there for deconstruction of the tropes.
Hold on, Sumica just needs to learn the language and translate for us
look up waiting music on http://www.youtube.com
Ok.
FlutterMEDIC: http://i.imgur.com/0Hmgi.jpg did that too.
If we're streaming on Halloween, seriously
There is no way that Storm of Swords can possibly make me suffer.
inb4 +m
otakon: i swear hes got images binded to every key
I meant everywhere not just Bronystate

Reikim: Yeah... you'll need it

We need something shit-pants worthy

Yes I'm serious.
*falls asleep*
well
It should be 24 hours of Nightmare night
FlutterMEDIC: Yes, it took me months to carve (since it was my first time ever carving stone) and I just finished today. Here's a pic of the side, where the stone looks really good: http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/6093/img7730b.jpg
all I can say is
otakon: likely because they're not Game of Thrones books.
Waits patienly.

Midnight_Fyre, what material is that?
I remember that day we watched Clone Wars and it kept buffering.
ALL the buffers!
if you need to vent after finishing the book
isn't Game of THrones the first in the Song of Fire and Ice series?
Is the stream working for you'

yes, otakon

Buffuh Ganghan style
when I read "the band started playing the rains of castamere" I nearly stopped reading right there and left the book
nope.
They gotta find Twlight to hatch that Dragon egg
no stream?

Oppa Buffah Styuh

RAWRity: well dammit everyone calls it game of thrones and I thought that was what the book series was called
05fun part is
meanwhile in 2-fort
Midnight_Fyre, that must have taken some time to get to that point. I don't know if you saw this earlier, but I did this out of abs plastic: http://i.imgur.com/Uozn8.jpg
05my dad read my DA
Now I'm confused about what to expect from that book now.
the tv series is called GoT
05reads*
just read it
nope. Just the HBO miniseries
it's good
04Harro is completely silenced by the magical spinning circle
Wrek: How did that turn out?
FlutterMEDIC: who's the guy batting the buffer?
Whoa, ponies made out off ood.
Wrek: Is that good or bad thing?
Meanwhile: ...THATS your true form?
I haven't seen much of season 2 of the series
05good thing i tagged the NSFW as strict.
is it as good as the first?
I bet that's a fun experience Wrek.
lol
05the questionable one wont botehr him as much
Brad__: are those printed?
Eli:...David Tennant
MrBen: Actually that's just more buffering.
Nice going, Wrek.
Tassadork, yes
meanwhile in tf2 brony server *putis spencer here
If it's stupid then I won't care. If it tries to gut-punch me, well, I've been gut-punched enough to not care.
I was kind of pissed at them showing Stannis screwing Melisandre
Meanwhile: lol
Brad_: I didn't see that before. Nice work
04"It...it must be...the Buffer Dragon D:"
Wrek Well, It's a really nice image, but even so you don't show your parents that kinda stuff
it was much more effective when it was just implied
So who's stream is WORKING?
Midnight_Fyre, thanks :)
Not me.
TWarTovlerWars, HEEEEEEY! SEXY CIRCLE!
DSNesmith: if you like vagina monsters and constant sex scenes, sure.
Brad__: so awesome. makes me want a 3d printer even more
oh Wrek you so silly~ But I'm proud you draw clop.
Find me a picture of a dragon Ghosties and I will make it happen.
FlutterMEDIC: i knew it! it's so pixeld, i just wanted to be sure
.... vagina monsters?
"You are doing WHAT with ponies!?"
Ghosties: it's the Ouroboros
is that the shadow baby?
DSNesmith: You should realize by now that the GoT show is 50% sex appeal.
yesh
Wrek: Well you worked hard on it for the monies.
also fuck Ros
How bout we show Dragon Quest until D-wars is ready
THE BUFFER CIRCLE IS THE OUROBOROS!
Tassadork, Im going to make some more in different scales and give them to anyone that might want one.
Oh noes Buffer Dragon. Were doomed.
THE END IS NEAR!
hey guys guess what
she adds nothing
keep em white so you can paint them if you want.
NEIGH!
I did like what they did with Theon though
Vivix: Thanks. Here is the front again: http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/9027/img7727a.jpg
Uhhhhh.......are you guys getting the same buffer as me?
Reikim: yeah
meanwhile in equestria *dear princess celestia...*
Wrek: Your parents don't seem to mind it so it can't be that bad.....
Bu Bu Buff Buffa Gangnam style
Everyday I'm buffering! http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24797891.jpg
I think I am
but it's still not bad
Someday, I just know that circle is going to spin the other way...
he's less of a complete dick in the miniseries
I <3 pokemon crystal :)
The actors in the GoT TV show are paid to stand around shirtless. THAT IS ALL.
GoT has mastered what I like to call "Sexposition" they have exposition of important plot points smack dab in the middle of the sex scenes.
Dark92Enigma: Yeah, but there's a reason for it.
and it's a fairly faithful adpatation
wrek link to da?
/me dances.
Reikim: even the dwarf
buffer circle y u no show movie
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24797891.jpg
Staring at the circle long enough will get you high
he actually goes to his dad to get help for Robb, instead of intending to betray him the entire time
RBY <3
TWarTovlerWars: Heeeeeey, sexy buffer~ (Sorry, had to do it)
ayyyyyyyyyy sessy streamer
Dark92Enigma whole stream is paused. Mod had technical difficulties i think
RAWRity: You get a /) because I am so using that term from now on.
op op op oppa buffah styuh

Everlasting_Joy: oh i get it
The gods are angry at us. A SACRIFICE MUST BE MADE!
Still buffering.
After months of work I've finally finished her: http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/9027/img7727a.jpg
so, uh, did the stream commit suicide?
For thosee who want to know. Wrek's DA name is Wreky
RAWRity: I bet that's a real thing
oppa buffer style
Crippler: Bring forth the virgins!
I Sacrifice this COOKIE!

fanceh
quick name every Dragon movie you can think of
It's Pinkamena in alabaster stone
fluttercry jeje first
Derpy stop. You make this work.
Midnight_Fyre: good job man, it's a little lobsided to be honest be well damn done.
Midnight_Fyre, nice, I've never carved anything but plaster- it looks very retro, like 80s house decor
I want to get something to drink.
HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.
Great time for the add though
My mouth is dying
DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS Ya.tatatatatatata
everyday I'm bufferin'
Azuredragon: It the Engenieer if Derpy took his position for the day.
does dungeons and dragons count?
Ooh, sacrifices. Wish Tzekel Khan was here to see this?
no ads!
Eyeup.
ERAGON
Ryunosuke: no, and that's a WMC if I ever saw one
We need Woona and her Cartographers Hat to repair the buffer machine!
Can someone call THE REPAIR MARE MARE MARE MARE?
Is it working yet?
Puff the Magic Dragon > DWars :p
the ONLY good dragon movie is DRAGONHEART
Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
be it title or actually in the movie
Is stream alive or dead. Just got here, Every day I'm bufferin' :$
Lol I remeber Tzekel. Crazy dude.
otakon: thanks. it was my first time working in stone, so I think I need a bit of practice, but I'm satisfied
DRAGONHEART IS BEST DRAGON MOVIE!
Mmm, guys look at this circle! M, guys look at this circle! Mmm, guys look at this circle! ...it won't start!
buff-buff-buffah
Azuredragon, There there Derpy. Leave the wrench-banging to Applejack.
But Sexposition. Perfect term. I am adding it to my list of commonly-used terms.
I was gonna post Dragonheart
so I managed to watched a full ep of Gamegrumps before Sumica came back?
OVERACTING vs UNDERACTING
RAWRity: copyright it
Yeah, it's pretty smart.
anyone else hate youtube's new "we won't buffer unless you're playing" thing
otakob Eeyup
It is going right there among all the tropes I use.
RAWRity: send it to TVtropes
COWARD KILLING TIME!
don't know what to say
derp medic
The pic doesn't really do the stone justice
he's translating it right now
DSNesmith: So, so much.
Ok.
DSNesmith: Yes.
DSNesmith: oh utter stupidity
Dragon Sean Connery is one of those, your argument is invalid things
Sexposition.
I'm watching the Bad Movie Beatdown of this while I'm waiting
RosePetal Oh, so it's in japanese
it's probably revenge for all the people using adblocker
It's Korean.
Korean flashback, rest english
MEDIC!,MEEDIC!,DOCTOR!!
Hey, does D-War have a sexposition scene?
someone can just type it up for us.
does godzilla count as a dragon?
DSNesmith: Well, maybe if the ads weren't shite.
no
Well at least that's what I'm getting.
no sex
in fact
RosePetal: That's how you spell the first part of his name. Sweet. He's awesome
Dammit
Ah... That explains things. Like I said... Just got here. I was SOOOO busy today. Made $280 in scrap from crap in my garage! :O
SPOILER ALERT
.
the LI dies int he end
We don't care, spoilers now.
Oh
What is the LI?
Anypony watched DUNGEONS and DRAGONS?.........
love interest
richfiles, garage slaes?
Love interest.
Ahaha
Ryunosuke: He breathes fire, doesn't he?
Ryunosuke: No... he counts as Godzilla! :P
had it on VHS ages ago, never saw it
lol saw the Nostalgia Critics review of it.
THe live action movie with Wesley Crusher???
Is the romance as wooden as the protag's face?
Sex?! It's a movie about DAGRONS
she gives her soul to the good snake
guys it looks like AJ is about to buk us
Dark92Enigma, goood, let me feed off your anger and hate :)
Spike.
Dark92Enigma Satan's game?
and it turns into a dragon
Nope... Cleared out excess scrap metal from my shop.
Dark92Enigma: Depends. Are you talking about the animated series?
Prolfion and Blue lipped man.
05,15Isn't a ton of Game of Thrones exposition told through sex?
Dark92Enigma: I believe I OWN that movie. :D
I watched near 2007.............then i saw the review 2 years later
an actual chinese-looking dragon, so props for that
It's a movie about Spike fighting the other Dagrons.
fluttercry: Yes.
I've heard of D-War through Rifftrax
can anyone join the silent theatre? its so lonely there...
fluttercry: yes, thus why we have the term sexposition now
richfiles, well I guess you fit your name correctly
In the show, anyway.
Rifftrax did this?
MrBen: The Movie
in the book the sex scenes are still there
You got rich....from files
fluttercry: Less than the TV Series would make you believe, but a good chunk of the book's plot is about who exactly is banging who.
You get to see Alfie Allen's schlong.
Dark92Enigma: Though to answer your question....no. No, neither the movie nor the series.
Elit3xPon3 what?
HURR DURR HAR HAR I'm not funny
more spoilers for ASoIaF:
You got rich.... from being rich.
Elit3xPon3 Which one?
I wonder if I should go play some Basement Collection
...though I HAVE played the game. ....like, three times.
fluttercry: thus the term Sexposition

the entire thing with tyrion and sansa was so sad
also
Duh, I is acting.
Ok, so how long is this gonna buffer?
OMG PANIK DA STREAM IS DEAD!!!!
The movie is SO bad it killed the stream
/me looks at TF2 slowly downloading
I knew it
HAL?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
on the livestream site the silent theatre im there watching ponies with 3 ppl
THE MOIVE IS SO BAD
should show mlp while kerjiggering
it KILLED THE STREAM!
pyrocatboy, glorious
the stream couldn't handle a two-layer flashback
Ryunosuke: Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta
it overloaded
Spazturtle PANIC PANIC PANIC
pyrocatboy: OPEN THE POD BAY DOORS, HAL
I am Galstaff, sorcerer of light!"
But man, the final scene of AGoT, with that girl and the dragons? That was pretty badass.
pony_6732: can't
LOl never heard of this movie so I can't wait to see how bad it is.
JESmith: I think so.
AlienWarhead: i meant the movie
otakon: if the stream could survive Titanic II it can survive this
Fuggit, I'm watching "Manos: The hands of Fate".
JESmith: he'll give us a heads up
the dragons have done fuck all for the next four books
Sumica will tell us don't worry. Calm down everyone.
Randomnerd: there is a game for that
04Okay so
04We're gonna switch over to the rifftrax version
Randomnerd: That is not a movie, you will not claim it is a movie, I refuse to believe it is a movie.
Midnight_Fyre: NOTHING can wholly survive Titanic 2
I dont' know how AFFC and ADWD could be so bad after the amazing first three
I mean
clash of kings
the comet
Reikim: it's creepier in the books
that amazing symbolism
how could he go from that
04So sorry about this, but we gotta do it
to detailing tyrion's bladder problems
otakon: True. I think a part of me died that day that I still haven't been able to bring back
Where was Gondor when something something Rifftrax?
it just boggles the mind
yay
damn
Thank you
Will we start from the beginning?
meh
That's fine
Midnight_Fyre: it was your sould
Ok.
*M Bison* YESSSSSSSSS
...
its cool
Well, I'm oout until it's done
Like we shoulda done in the first place
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
we can add our own jokes as well
same as Vivix
JESmith: A-MEN
DSNesmith: The dragons do fuck all? Well, shit. That's just great. WAY TO WASTE A GOOD PLOT POINT.
(M.Bison) Yes! Yes!
Sweetie Belle: YES! YES! YES!
Dammit. Now I have to make up my own jokes during the movie.
Does anyone else suspect that Tyrion is the only person getting out of this at all?
As long as we get to see how bad this movie is. I'm fine with this.
im out for this movie then
it's like
http://i.imgur.com/Sf96G.gif
well
still buffering here, you guys?
what I think happened
rookeealding like always
is he set up a shitload of foreshadowing
Reikim: as of yet, they are still very young
and then had an ending in mind
PillowPoni: (Twilight) Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Spectrum_Rush: lol
otakon: probably. I do sort of feel like I've been drifting spiritually aimlessly ever since I saw that movie
but realized he had no clue how to get there
Since Rifftrax = modern day MST3K .............bring it on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally a picture.
IT LIVES!
CMC KERBALS GO!
MrBen: Captain Falcon: YESZ!
what movie was this?

CMC ASTRONAUTS.
and PEEWEE!

a'ww I've missed Pee Wee
Oh hai Peewee.
Am I the only one that feels very neutral about Rifftrax?
I could never be bothered to read the wheel of time stuff

Oh my god
I do hope we see Pee Wee more in the next season

Kandarihu: he changed his mind

Lol.
Rex_Mundi: I never have, sorry.
Sumica: so that's why
I can't hear the exposition. heh heh heh
Sumica it is destiny
RAWRity: Path of Daggers. I couldn't get past that one. I literally reread the series three times and I couldn't get past Path of Daggers.
LOl.
04D-bag wars
it's definitely an acquired taste

Ghosties: lol
Oh, isnt this movie extreamly bad?
xD
Ghosties: *spits drink out* XD
if we're comparing awful fantasy
Ghosties: :D
lol BIG HOLE
Hammy actor.
This sounds like the backstory for NINJA SURF
lol
by far the worst I've ever read
Ghosties: :D
otakon, even so, it just doesnt feel right to have to see commentary on a movie without seeing it itself
Wait, I think I seen this movie......
CSI
Rifftrax is better if you've seen the movie alreayd.
is Terry goodkind
04LISTEN TO ME!
*already
04I PROVIDE CONVEYANCE!
Ryunosuke: doesn't matter it's this or nothing
Fluttershy is a fan of Rifftrax
Ghosties: is he crying yet?
True that.
Wait, Sheriff Carter's car?
04Not yet
otakon, then I would go with nothing :)
Ghosties: CAP SPAM. I LOVE YOU.
quickly, get do vah kin fluttershy . :U
I keep voting for twilight for the movie
a
He covered dragon wars you know
but it never gets picked
You know what series is surprisingly consistent despite dozens of books?
RAWRity: Discworld?
04When there's a dragon flying over his head that's when a single solitary tear will trail down his face
Lol they hate him because he's not wearing a tie.
yup
AlienWarhead: he's covering them now
lol
God I love Discworld.
Ghosties: and then he'll get shat on
Terry Pratchett is my idol.
lol
lol
tfw terry pratchett ;_;
Well, the Rifftrax is talking over the dialog in the movie, and frankly forcing itself on the scenes without dialog.
While I'm here, anyone know a good Irc client? Hydra sounded good on paper, but last update is 2010 and half the features are disabled
we said the same thing
AlienWarhead: But can he see why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
My camera can ZOOM SO CLOSLEY.
AlienWarhead: and Twilight performed a spell that made the rest of the mane 6 sound like Rifftrax
Ghosties: Before it gets ripped off.
It's sad what's been going on with Pratchett
mustard brown looks pretty good
i've seen some things maaaan

These guys are FUCKING AWESOME
Vivix: mIRC is a good one
I need to look for some really bad movies.
we need more zoom!
Your a dragon Harry.
bc you can do ANYTHING with animation
Ghosties: NO, john. YOU are the dragons.
Pratchett is too goddamn good for Alzheimer's.
they're closing in on a treatment for alzheimer's
I like the eventlog and windows and such in HydraIRC, but--so much hassle when options is disabled and such
hmmm... 4am. I think Ill head to sleep. Goodbye all!
lol
mIRC hm-
04Mogwai! :D
lol Gremlins
The one thought on my mind right now, "Will those guys please SHUT UP"?
not going to have a cure anytime soon though
Makes bad movie hilarious

04Lol
Ghosties: And then John was a dragons.
LOl Gremilns references.
a'www that sucks
Touch everything
When did the Mane 6 start sounding like the MST3K crew?
lol
Pratchett's not gonna let Alzheimer's take him.
one of the most imaginative minds in the world
He's going to die first.
Must touch EVERYTHING!
double flashback!
Vivix: Either mIRC or XChat.
and it's gonna slip away
Rifftrax makes this much more watchable
:'(

Double the Flashback. Double the Fun.

/me looks at both 'Thanks PillowPoni|Minecraft
Ghosties: http://i.imgur.com/nj02j.jpg Yes or no?
good authors always end up dead
Pratchett is going to die in the next few years. Assissted suicide.
RosePetal Ha Ha
You know what book I love? Good Omens. Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman together is just...delicious.
Xmen.
Vivix: You're welcome
Also: bad authors also inevitably end up dead, too.

Everlasting_Joy: Aww, you beat me to it *hugs*

Reikim: true but they usually don't lose their minds before they stop writing however
lets get DANGEROUS
LETS GET CREEPY

/me dies from Fluttershy's hug
You are the one from my dreams

Meanwhile: good one man
I SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS.
that name still sounds incredibly stupid
04The light from Heaven, Arkansas
Everlasting_Joy: Oh. Nice one. I didn't even see those at first. xD
Blame Ghosties. He gave me the image.
So, what movie rifftrax are we watching?
Can i ponify the lyrics for MST3K, please?
"aah"
wirisme1989: it's a bad pronounciation of a Korean word
Ghosties: Chosen one! Wee woo weee wee woo wiiii.
/me revives himself with a Pick Me Up
lol because all dragons look like that.
Anyway
The light from the dragon balls
oh god
Terry Pratchett.
Eddmario: Dragon Wars
Korean? I thought I heard him say quarian.
continuity error
05,15good question
wirisme1989: probably is better sounding in native Korean
dat continuity error
continuity? whazzat?
I can't express how much I love his books.
true
Oh yeah, where did the scroll go? Witchcraft!
REMINDER
THERE ARE NO DRAGONS IN THIS MOVIE
Let us read the WHOLE SCRIPT
THEY ARE BIG COBRAS
fluttercry: so far the Rifftrax people have made the same two points WE have
Why do I find this guy's terrible acting so wonderful?
What?
wow, i leave for 30 minutes and come back to the same moment
00,10Kandarihu, prepare to be disapointed
god this movie
well, i need to sleep. goodnight everypony
Even his "Discworld for Children" is amazingly intelligent.
it's called D-War, Dragon Wars
twilight_sprinkle: lol with Rifftrax addede
and there are no frigging dragons
Night, BronyInstrumental
gift of the pikachu
Night night BronyInstrumental.
GODZILLA.
otakon: joy <.<
>yfw the Disembaudio voice is removed.
Danielewski is easily the most cutting edge author alive atm. He's this decade's David Foster Wallace
I could watch that old guy try to act all day
just giant cobras
and crabs
PillowPoni|Minecraft: Bye!
FLASHBACK
so beautiful
How are you holding it?
Everlasting_Joy: Night!
Ghosties, can i ponify the MST3K lyrics here on BS?
and pterodactyls
so many flashbacks
RAWRity: More info? I'm intrigued.
lol midnight
00,10wait
AJIsAwesome: I'm not going to bed silly :).
There's no options.
Ghosties: BronyState
00,10are we seeing a flash back in a flashback?

david foster wallace...
yes
05,15Yes Sumica

05,15Yes we are
I feel I know the name
That's true.
Sumica: eeyup, bad movie design 101
....
what this?
04...the ponies
He looks like an Asian Dumbledore
Flashbackception.
DOWN IN FRONT
Sumica: ponies are in the way
Everlasting_Joy: Whoops.:$
Sumica Is this movie on LSD
05,15lol
oh hey.....the ponies are blocking
04Yay
Insert Inception button
04NINJA

He's smiling.
maybe I'm confusing him with alan dean foster
move the ponies
Sumica: thanks
the ponies are in da way
04NINJA!!!! D':
Reikim: this is from his first book, House of Leaves; http://famousmonstersoffilmland.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/houseofleaves.jpg
Oh crap they teleported
I can understand THESE words!
Oh wait
ah, that guy
BWUUUUUUN.
NEENJAH!
Kung-Fu Hustle?
I have a splinter :(
Suffice to say, the way this Rifftrax is being shoved down my throat like this, my chances of ever enjoying Rifftrax are diminishing.
House of Leaves.
04I guess so, Dark92
You don't say?
I've heard of that.
wirisme1989: awesome
I've heard. Of that.
BRB. Reloading in flash this time... I liek being able to SEE the ponymoticons I type! :)
00,10fun fact: stfu I am 15 seconds ahead of you by the time you bitch it's already been fixed
I need to read it.
04Will the buffer dragon attack now?
If that dead girl were a main character this movie would be a lot better
I'm already sitting.
I'm not reading that now because I intend to read the whole thing.
how do you get a splinter out of your thumb?
0,14same
anyone know any good sci fi authors these days?
Sumica: but.... :(
Sumica stop being so mean. :(
Your child is ded.
04We will sacrifice her to the movies
00,10no
I can think of Stover, Bujold....
that's about it
Sci-fi is on the decline recently.
0,14I really should read House of Leaves
Stop bothering him you twonks.
But I thought they were in heaven.
04She will be a Hollywood starlet and become a vegan
SHUT UP, RIFFERS! GEEZ!
Back :)
Rifftrax? XD
Sumica: I love you meaness. :)
SaxyPretender: yes. you should.
Yuh Yi GOO.
it's brilliant.
There. Had to refresh...
is that the meta book
i tried tweezers but it went deeper into me drawing blood beutiful blood
It's
that's like four books
05,15Kandarihu this is going to be through the whole movie. So stop
How? How did she defile heaven?
Is this Kung-Fu Hustle?
"my wife died giving birth to the child!" *yay*
Yeah
DISCORD.
OK, here it goes........
According the TV Topes anyway.
00,10Kandarihu, bad night to bitch. I recomend you stop
fluttercry: Yes. Thank you....
Just the village? Not very big considering te world.
Red Dragon
04SHE IS THE CHOSEN ONE
THE RED DRAGON!
CUz I'm a Wizard.
House of Leaves basically takes every convention you're used to for novels and tells it to go fuck itself.
Ugh
lol
meh
SHE'S IMMUNE TO FIRE!
Sumica: Double. Thank you.
brb
The child has Garble on her.
pony
PONY!
04Little did they know, she was a mare
those kind of books don't really do it for me
she's kind of chunky
05,15Sarah Jessica Parker?
Finnegan's Wake is incomprehensible trash
HOERS
04And they lived in Ireland
sorry Kandarihu
It's a book about a book about a movie about a house that's a labyrincht.
Kandarihu: you should have muted
Kandarihu: If all you're going to do is bitch, please, do us ALL a favor and leave.
04OH GOD
Dat headband.
What movie is this?
04ROCK OF ROVE
*labyrinth
*labyrinth

Lack of Rove
Kandarihu: You.... Care about this movie? :S
lol
HORSE!
drown the Pony!
Lack of love.
Is that the steroid pony? O_o
suddenly kung fu
lol cgi
Kandarihu: ikr, rifftrax is quite unfunny...
Suddenly kung fu.
We all love Rove
Panda it's a horse
:) has best hoers faec! :$
I love mike and the guys
This is such shitty fight choreography.
awa?
Awhaaaa
OohShiny: no shit xD
MASF123: Dragon Wars wirh Rifftrax
Korean Power Rangers
lol
04...why are they fighting?
we wire fu now
04Or were fighting?
Ghosties: training
Panda and ponies aren't horses...
He's using the force?
Sparring.
Because asian movie?
04Harem
They were training.
Ghosties: just training
haram
urgh
Panda ponies are equines...
04You need to build a better harem, Haram!
Harem of girls.
Why don't I have any shoes?
see experimentation for the sake of experimentation does not appeal to me
You must meet my beautiful wives.
lol Fugitive ref
04whoa
lol dat CGI
Ghosties: we need a glasses girl, a busty girl and the perfect girl!
whoa
04SUDDENLY
dat cgi
05,15LOL
HOLY SHIT
dat CGI
lol
lol fake.
oh god
....
the hell was that?
we sci-fi original movie now
O____________O what
AWESOME!
"This is my mother-in-law".
05,15OH god this is going to be good
Imoogi.
Lol
Dragon
warned you fluttercry
Im Moogie.
only SWIMS
wait wait
Everlasting_Joy: *spits out drink* xD
A /) if you know what samsara means.
OohShiny, all ponies are horses, not all horses are ponies. This is just a fact
Hey leave spike out of this
So, we have to kill it.
the Imoogi ARE only big snakes
It's a wyrm
I only pray to albino dragons
04Dear God, this movie will be the Gojira of the 22nd century
they don't BECOME dragons until they get that power
0,14(\
It's the Circle of the Life!
Something tells me Fluttershy wouldnt like this movie...
Ghosties: Gojira?
00,10wait.......did we just have a thirdlayer flashback?
YES.
Rex_Mundi: with dragons yeah
05,15yup
Vivix ponies aren't horses, they are equines, they are horse cousins
lol
manatees
Yes we did
Sumica: eeyup
04Only, not nearly as iconic
sea serpent to be precise
04Godzilla, PillowPoni
Sumica: flashbackception
00,10good god, we have to go deeper
the element of harmony
Sumica: Permission to whip out the Inception button?
it's experimentation for the sake of giving a new experience to readers outside of the general novel format. Making a book's format tell the story just as much as the words.
I no longer know what's flashback and what's not.
THIS IS SO GETTING WMC
Sumica: more derper, accoridn got the reviewers :P
so is the kid hearing this story in another langueage from it's own?
Is the whole movie flashbacks?
From now on, you must take this necklase from Spencers.
0,14(also helps that a song in Soul Calibur V is called Samsara: The Wheel of Eternity)
OohShiny, not true- as faras I know they're the same genus and all. A pony is, as far as I've been told, a height specification within the selected breed
OohShiny: No, ponies are simply small breeds of horse, same species.
It's dangerous to go alone! Take this!
04But Fluttershy likes it!
Meanwhile: when we see..there he is
05,15We need to go deeper
Anyway, I can empathize with that one. Only Revolutions. Because sometimes, my mind does actually look like that.
Stop switching timelines!
nested flashbacks ftw
00,10suddnly
Nope. If off. Cant stand Rifftrax. see ya all around.
night
Pilgrims.
oh boy
wtf
what we need now is a flashback within this flashback
dat CGI
HOLY SHIT
WTF
THE HUNS.
04Jesus, even Sauron wants them
Night Fou_Lou
look a moose!
CGI attacks
look, it's the Gungans!
IT'S THE CLONE ARMY!
surprise!
Suddenly another flashback!
suddenly Dinotopia invades
oh wee oo
OH NOES slug monsters!
power rangers
pokemon
When did we start watching Dinotopia?
lol POKEMONS.
One does not simply walk into...woah you know what go ahead.
SQUIRTLES!
That' an awesome idea!
LOTR budgets got smaller after the third movie
Sumica: Permission to link Inception button?
finally
It's the CLONE GUNGAN ARMY!
05,15pokemon x LoTR
05,15do it
pokemon + LOTR = this?
00,10fine
actually it's pretty good looking
XD
wow, Reikim and i are on the same wavelength tonight. Back to back star wars references
Thanks :3
Fluttercry: Yes. Agreed.
is this that Dragon Movie?
Did you think cannons can stop me?!
Final Fantasy?
http://inception.davepedu.com/
peter jackson's latest movie was not blessed with a large budget
the hell is this?
Pony: a horse of a small breed, especially one below 15 hands (or 14 hands 2 inches).
This rifftrax is pretty bad; the ID4 rifftrax last week was EXCELLENT
Pokemon + LoTR = 8th Pokemon Movie
I just hope we can have it without the Rifftrax tomorrow.
Well there was one dragon so I guess.
Man, that CGI is...very video gamey
They screwed.
00,10we must find the chosen woman. Bomb the city
04So it's Godzilla meets Transformers meets Lord of the Rings
RosePetal: actually it's not a dragon yet
Explodium
Those...exploded rather viciously.
dinosaurs with rocket launchers. becasue we can
DSNesmith: or rather, it was, but then he turned it into 3 movies because he forgot how to edit.
05,15Ghosties meets pokemon
yeah that's not gonna work
dinosaur rockets. my night is complete
Wait, what time period was this in?
Anyone seen Kung-Fu Hustle?
Sumica This CGI is REALLY video gamey
Inception Bwoooooon fits perfectly with this movie.
sure that'll help it
.....
War has changed
Tassadork: that is not all
04Meets Pokemon
Because I'm pretty sure Korea did not have cannons at this time.
Outer space time.
Dammit Mr. Bay, stay out of movies
Dinosaurs with Launchers. Your arguement is invalid.
you wanted a 12 hour movie?
damn
if she's there, and they need her, why are they blastin the village?
04Battletoads
You think they had dinosaurs?
04Oh my
Reikim: Fuedal Japanarea
battletoads
05,15Battletoads....
Those are god dame missiles
lol
MICHAEL BAY!
And those are European-style cannons.
otakon: yeah we're still early on
Brumak, that is all
inb4 goddamit
Battletoads....
05,15These guys are so awesome
OH MY GOD
DSNesmith: I'm talking about the Hobbit
I am finding this awesome.
ah
Micheal Bay is so getting off on this.
Who is Ghosties? Btw.
They're riding raptors.
inb4 goddamit
wait it's 3 now
again
I thought it was just 2
16th century missiles
LOL!
I bet this is the best part of the movie
yep
Why are you complaining about the cannons.
04I'mma mod
:D
Reikim: 1500s
Find the girl. But you might have killed her.
Wombo combo
I am laughing my ass off here
Dragons finally appear.
05,15MASF123 one of the very first mods....
Imma pre-order Battletoads! :D
nope, they finished up filming and Jackson announced it would be THREE movies
The Hobbit does not deserve three movies. It isn't nearly as long as the LotR trilogy.
Stratadons, hide the ponies!
He ate him.
WATCH IN HORROR AS THIS DINOSAUR... gently pushes over a rock fence
I love those little pewter dragon statues. :)
05,15Someone call the pawn stars guy and ask if he has battletoads
yh they do not stand a chance
Really? Oh wow. :O
so enthrian vs rocket launcher dinos. who wins?
HIde your kids.
Wilhelm
04WILHELM
Heya MASF123! :)
wilhelm!
Wilhelm!
WILHELM
Dragons standing upright on back legs?

Hell, it's the only LotR book that's readable

Wilhelm. Here?
WILHEIM!
WLHELM NOOOO
lol Wilhelm.
WILHIEM yea
WILHEM
Also a Wilhelm dammit
Wiru Herumu NUUUU
Hi
wat
Reikim: they're gonna be padding it with stuff from Tolkein's lengthy notes, as well as bits of the Silmarlilion
so.. they new these things exisited and they never build up a good defence for them
04This movie is so all over the fucking place
wat
Rappy WHY!?
MASF123, go read the meet the staff, about us, faqs and stuff
Jurassic Park!
wilhelm didn't fall down
only LOTR book that's readable
Ghosties: you have no idea
Why always poor Wilhelm
oh you didn't just go there
What the?
where's the blood?
this is being discribed to the kid
So yeah, I bet manechat is pulling out the rape jokes now.
this is sort an eastern 300
Reikim: Agreed. At first I was excited for the Hobbit movies, but now I'm afraid they are going to drag out a lot of pointless scenes just to fill 3 movies
such SAVAGRY
what?
Why are they stripping them?
Wilhelm was also in the 2nd Twilight movie
WHERE'S THE BLOOD?
"They just want to strip the women."
wait... power rangers? O____________O
04ME
04IT'S ME
how do they know it wasn't on the OTHER shoulder huh?
these guys are way too shiney.
Not my daughter, you bitch!
04I'M THE TATTOO LADY
OohShiny, looked it up, horse and pony are Equus ferus caballus
DSNesmith: I mean it in a kind of loving way. The Hobbit, I mean, is the only one of average length and detail. I love it to bits.
Lady spills the beans
Rosepetal to find the dragon tatoo
ello everypony :)
To look for the Yu i Joo
Ghosties: I KNEW IT!
Midnight_Fyre: actually, instead they're just going to be telling us more of the story than the book did.
SO it's Pokemon meets 300 meets LotR meets Power Rangers?
I'm the Girl with the Tatoo.
Ghosties Have you ever seen 30 Days of Night 2: Dark Days?
he's dead
That dad is taking a LONG time to fetch an ambulance, isn't he? :|
Ded.
in other words they're making stuff up
!
Midnight_Fyre: for instance, we'll be seeing what Gandalf was up to that whole time.
okay this flashback is RIDICULOUS
oh
okay
Stratadons!
Is manechat being as stupid as I guess it is?
I'm good with that
04I haven't pyrocatboy
it's LONGER THAN THE FIRST SCENE!
DAMN!
DSNesmith: no, they're taking it from Tolkein's notes and other books.
Wizards!
Airbender?
FUS RO DAH
(Also agreed, I'm good with that.
)
the hell was that?
04Lol

00,10suddnly galdlf is a bad ass

Actually I am in the middle of rereading the Hobbit right now. To be honest, it's not as good as I remember it being as a kid
Ded.
Hilarious
Sound more like gorillas.
old man is gandalf
04I just heard the spear throw sound from Scorpion in Mortal Kombat!
wonder how they'll create dol goldur
Not the Horse Soldiers!
Someone, make a list of crossovers in this movie
Sumica: Gandalf the Badass
05,15Best movie ever
Hadonken
HADOKEN
DSNesmith: eeyup. and Benedict Cumberbatch is playing the necromancer
old man is korean gandalf

Ghosties why is it that I want to watch a movie set in this era instead of FLASHBACK OF FLASHBACK
wut
Crouching Tiger Hidden 300
tuskan raiders /me laughs
Your getting owned by Dumbledore Ninja. Your doomed.
Wow, these guys are as shitty with swords as stormtroopers are with blasters.
I didn't think he had physical form
it's just proto-sauron, isn't it
oh mai
NOW KISS.
I know what they did this
RosePetal: You're*
DSNesmith: and Sylvester McCoy will play Ratagast
before he goes back to the black tower
RosePetal: But where's Voldemort Ninja?
04If you want a movie in this era, watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger
Ghosties It is the shittiest REAL VAMPIRE movie I have ever seen.
05,15does this movie ever take a break?
And all this is being narratoted to the little boy?
05,15It's all over the place
blowjob
Even though we barely knew him.
they took a purely Korean movie and SPLICED IN ENGLISH APRTS
Say what, Ghosties?
Not the horse soldiers!
Korean Gandals is beating up the army while the young guy is flirting.
"Oh, come off it. I killed MY father and you don't hear ME whining about it."
Oh no.
00,10this reminds me of the princess bride
DSNesmith: Cumberbatch is also the voice of Smaug
:D
OH. MY. GOD.
BORMIR NO
04I was responding to Deadlypony3
Only the element of kung fu can save us
PAWNCH!

I'm glad I'm not the only one who cracked up at that scene
haha
00,10that was random as hell
04I totally didn't think they'd go that far
Ghosties: we must record that as a .gif
Well, that was the best moment of this movie.
Ghosties: they did
"I'm pregnant!"
04I thought she'd only touch the fence or something
That was graet
natalie portman in star wars episode 1
04But no
was a better actor than this
I feel like drawing Korean stuff for some reason.
Someone get a .gif of that!
also, do they explain WHY she had a book of goddamn talismans?
04She walked right into the fence
00,10well she did touch it
GAH
it could be hell sorry to say that
Her best moment of acting was when she was sitting staring into space.
DID THEY EXPLAIN WHY SHE HAS THIS STUFF?!
I'm about to choke on my ice cream
lol gif of that woman.
00,10her hands were full so she used her face
Ghosties and looked totally confused on top of that.
She was just...such a natural at it.

Ghosties: I know. Wasn't that hilarious?
Ghosties: Yea, i'll give them points for that scene
No not yet.

Reikim: we got it. it just wasn't that funny.

Night Vivix.
Better than Coors light

night vivix
Nighty night Vivix.
global
I thought alcoholism was the answer to your depression
Ghosties: IKR?:D
how about vodka
Ghosties Wesker doesn't NEED a reason
SATURRRRRATION
RAWRity: sadly, some actually think of it as a form of therapy. Also, I was hoping you'd all at least rag on me for it.
ghosties I HAVE NO IDEA
With no emotions.
Hell, a "BOOOOO" would have been nice.
I love you though.
Ah man, that was comedy gold
http://duloph.com/images%5CDragon%20Wars%5Cfence.gif
