0,14well, generally the lack of stallions can be attributed to the fact it's a girl's show and as such, they don't tend to include many male characters
maybe they recycle?
:3
Possibly.
:P
Stallions are not attractive
No
It is a reverse China effect in Equestria. :3
there are lots of stallions, just more mares... i find this acceptable
Kind of like how there isnt any male NPCs in Hyperdimension Neptunia

right by the Tate modern

Oh, well.

00,10also if they are mkv's there could be subfiles
Torrent ETA is 2 hrs
make sure to get the color corrected S1 :D
00,10and yeah over 2TB here.
Nah, I usually average 80-120KB/sec
was gonna say, that's some DAMN high Dsl.
lol
I think the household limit for downloads is 60 a month
my down speed= 1.7 MB/s
1.5 here -_- I thought that was much
*GB
50 Mbps upload and download here.
I don't really think I need more.
when i have money (hopefully soon) i'ma setup a 4/5 tb fileserver
Mb is also not the same as MB
per second
192KB
I pay ~50 bucks a month for a 10 Mbps download.
1.6MB/s down, 254.8 kB/s up
~16mbit/s here
could download at like 7MB/sec
though i usualy only get 1.2MB/s
But I hope to upgrade it soon.
S1 looks fine in 420, honestly.. STill think I need the 20 gig download just to show my brony-hood, though.
when you can download entire series in like, 2 hours... >.>
1.41Mbps :3
00,1015 down 2 up here.
after s2 is done i'm going to get 1080 of both seasons and rewatch them
Comcast sent me angry letters cause I ended up downloading like, 600GB in a month
which is apparently bad

i'm on a Lenovo G550 laptop, 250 gb HDD, 4096 mb RAM
00,10glad century link dont give a shit about my usage.
its actualy fine to force encryption on torrents now, bugger all people dont
00,10I hardly ever close stream or mirc
I have Century Link, but, when you only have 1.5Mbps... can't always have the stream up :(
My download speed is 0.48Mbps with the stream going...
ISPs that only care about bills getting paid roughly on time, ftw.
I can't wait to move back to the city.
Cause there have been months where I download only 4-500GB/month, and got no letter.
00,10I kinda lucked out as I am realy close to a net hub for them.
I had Century link when I lived with my folks.
On Suddenlink now.
/me is going to close FF soon to streamline torrent
I'm actually surprised I can handle having both the Stream up and SWTOR running, but, then again it is like 3am
lol
I usually have TF2 and WoW running at the same time because I never, ever close anything.
the whole chatroom is talking in computerfancy! =w= oh noes

Lol!! :D
That's also why I have the collection I have.
Macbeth was honestly the only story I liked in high school.
well story/play
I went to the site to take a look at it, read one sentence of a fic....then lost about 45minutes of my day (45 minutes wel spent)
Macbeth is good, I like it.
I never read Macbeth....
>yet
Even worse.
at some point there may be ponies
Exactly.
me and two other friends were the only ones that played it.
Lol :D
I found this incomplete 63 chapter lately. That was my day.
Well, some of it.
walked up to them said "you're welcome" and walked away like a boss
Nice :D
must of been because I was a senior @_@
Mainly because I can't go there IRL.
...YET.
and telling more would be spoilers
ok never
no ponies other than on tv in the rp
everyone has their opinions. =p

The exception being Scientology.
Haven't seen them in years.
brb, i want some breakfast before the show comes on at 8 :P

I've never been to an Oktoberfest.
I can kill a pint of Jack Daniels no problem.
I don't always drink, but when I do, it's Jack Daniel's.
Dat Twilight waking up too early
:D
JD was my first liquor.
loved it ever since =P
My first was a sort of liquorice drink, but I much prefer whiskey.
Ive tried many things :o
Dont get drunk tho, lol
I remember killing half a bottle of rum one night camping in the woods with a couple of my buddies.
o..m..g o_o
Yeah, I try to not drink TOO much. I can still keep my balance right up until I puke, but it's still not fun.
many toilet hugs were given.
Note to self: Never kill a bottle of vodka alone.
That is all.
xD
more proof
I know right :>
I'll be having Winter Wrap Up in my head for a while now, that's for sure.
I can't wait to start running again.
We have this running machine at our home.
I enjoy scenery
I enjoy nature as a matter of fact.
Lol xD
8 months ago I was a metal head, now I watch ponies.

I dropped my laptop last night.
Go for it.
Hello everypony :)
The worst possible thing D:
I carry my laptop by gripping right over the screen, and nowhere else.
hhii eevveerryyppoonnyy!!
i usually carry mine by the palmrest area under the keyboard, or by holding it closed, usually by the side
Hullo folk
Oh yeah, if I have to travel somewere, I close it down, but if I just want to show my friend something, I just hold it at the top.
just one tiny crack on the corner
I dropped my laptop last night.
Hey evrypony
for anyone walking in just
now
i once had my laptop fall on my face
I had mine thrown at my knee
Then you took a laptop to the face?
i'm talking a 3-foot drop
my heart stopped for about 5 seconds
because i was in here
It isn't normal for a heart to stop for 5 whole seconds :o
and when i picked it up, the power was off
I remember a phone I once had. Dropped it down a staircase, still working. I think if I pulled that stunt today, I'd have some dozen bits to gather.
Not money, either.
oh
Yeah, I had the thing happen with a baby alarm.
I accidently my phone into the toilet. I heard a SZZZCKKKT.
phone experience
Phones were much more fun when they were robust.

I have a G1 iPod
Bought it release day ^_^

I have never owned anything before the first series of iPod Touch. Didn't care much for music before then.
I don't usemine for music

Left Cricket for AT&T, now I have a Motorola Atrix
Now, I have music running virtually constantly, unless I'm watching something.

depends
like how old is Twilight
74u2clhs1w2p
o shit.
ummm
no idea, but I know Fluttershy is one year older than Pinkie
knows
An extraordinary student, sure, but a student nonetheless.
hmmm
I'd say young adults.
I feel bad for twilight
yeah
some 1 link me to that song
My initial reaction: Hooollyyy crapp
maybe teens,pre-teens?
plz
I'd say they are somewhere from 18-25
They're fillies.
yep
right
GUYS
if you didnt know
yep
YOU DON'T SAY.
o;
and also a good singer
nah
rainbow is
Guys! Pinkie Pie is a pony!
OH MY GAWH
didnt realise
I DIDNT KNOW THAT
also why are all of the main 6 such good fucking voice actors and amazing singers too?
Is this done in tablet?
6 ponies, 4 voice actresses
seems legit
lol
anyone agree with me?
14-18
Well, Rarity has a job making dresses, I'd say they are quite older
14-20
rarity is just really mature
16-20
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIZn8-4wqqw I think not
CMC?
cmc 7-10
The mane six are roughly in their twenties
lolno
how the
hmmm
13-4?
13-4?
13-14
i would say 6-12
i always pictured them alot younger
13-14, usual time before someone hits puberty.
i say 6-10
anyone?
i could
yeah
:P
awesome music :D
ill see
i think she said they are teenagers before
i seen her comment in DA
i dont think their teens
if I were to guess, I'd say around 20ish
Hold on, I'll check my Faust pictures, see if I can find it.
18-20 i would believe
cant find
AHA! unicorn
I found it on EQD instead.
as i said,the oldest is fluttershy supposedly,but i think dash may be older
The animation FAQ.
yeah
I'll spare you the full copypasta and post this.
"...I guess I sort of justified it in my head that they could be childlike young adults."
young adults
Young adults is young adults.
Teens is teens
HOWEVER
I figure Rarity's the oldest, since she's the only one with a decent business
Ash was 10, he's about 14 now
I know
think about simpsoons
18 is an adult
Been around for ages
teen starts at 13
She then goes on to say that maturity is different than age.
Maggie always has and still is a baby
i think they are 30 year old single women
I'm a young old fart
same here count
not old.
:D
I'd just link you the page, but I'm not sure I'm allowed to link to EQD.
kip
Since a stream is running.
this pony looks great
depends how far up their School goes up in age

Like The Matrix, or the Alien movies.
boooooo Matrix...
We could watch Terminator 2
Aww I missed Miyazaki Week
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8OpsPok6iQ
I think they shoulld show Pom Poko
GAH! STAR TREK ENTERPRISE WAS WORST STAR TREK EVER!
We should watch the 1903 movie "The Great Train Robbery"
otakon:What?
its like 9mins long
WE SHOULD WATCH THE GREAT DICTATOR
We should dig a moat!
ever
And don't forget that Star Trek Online follows the story according to the last film too
Dat break in the sentence.
I'll do that then
Been a while since I played STO.
If it was to be shown, we'd just best hope for maturity amongst the viewers
It's nice to have an mmo that doesn't just require "kill this" as an objective.
same thing
We should watch the Good The Bad and the Ugly
maybe for the next week
is that or downfall
Greeting everypony.
Have we watched any Westerns lately?
idea... I DEMAND A CLINT EASTWOOD MARATHON!
But I'm hardly fit to talk about mmo diversity, I've played WoW for like, 5 years.
"Star Trek Online" just went F2P
Just? It's been F2P for like a month.,
0,5Ah
night scav
Just. It has been sub for 2 years. Comparing it to that.. yeah JUST
WWIIOL is best MMO
hello
Hey, y'all realize it's been 1 month since "The Last Roundup"?
it has?
i dont keep track of time...
0,5Eenope
and it's STILL not back on iTunes is it?

Ahh MMO speak!
Actually you can set it to autoshoot when ready
?
hio
Yep.
I really liked the whole shift power to improve systems thing though, that's still there right?
Bye TheFerpiest!
yep.
Derp*
Suddenly in the mood for star trekking.
But the lockboxes they added to STO & LOTRO (as seen in TF2) are horrrrrrible
You know, the ones that you get a crate but have to buy the key with real cash
This I must try.
Ohmygoditworks.
I only use lockboxes if I feel the need to burn money.
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/110122.jpg
i have a crat in TF2 i cant open it
you need to buy a key from the TF2 store
"new" medigun?
Well, it was named strange medithingy or something
i want it ... are you looking for something ?
not sure
okay post it
Post, and be judged.

It could just be the way her hind leg closest to the viewpoint is angled.

Decomposing gas.
It's the mythbusters, they make mostly everything explode
And what's wrong with that?
*especially* concrete trucks
Whale corpses have been known to explode because of decomposed insides.
1,3someone's going to be lighting a cigarrette there and blow themselves up
Burning methane gass, fun
i call bullshit on this one

This needs about 20% more engines
And then it explodes.

Not really.
13not with these engines anyway

I had a spider egg bundle on my windowsill once.
Leave spiders alone.
They're adorable.
08,01<3
SPIDER! SPIDER SPIDER SPIDER!!!

00,10oh gog why.
I HATE DAMN SPIDERS
Pinkie would have freaked by now
08,01spiders are cute
"Not yet" Words to live by
Saturn: well, 1 spider is cute
seriously saturn?
08,01ofna01: yup
O___O
that spider is boss
i don't really mind spiders but i hate spiderwebs. dunno why
Spider"BITCH! I AIN'T SCARED OF YOU!" *bites Adam*
00,10I could not do that.
especially the erratic ones without geometry
Now do it again with goliath tarantulas.
like,illl scream and run
I mean, some people can't even watch one without freaking out
13me either .-.
depends on the size i guess
even in a picture
08,01the other day, i found this *huge* spider during a concert i was recording
13don't make me hit you .-.

00,10I dont mind most othere bugs but spiders.....
08,01i picked it up and it enweibbified my hands
did someone say "huge spider"?
http://www.camelspiders.net/camel-spider/spider9.jpg
rofl
camel spiders
Camel spiders, not really spiders.
:D
i've seen those up close before
their a type of scorpion or something like that
Still arachnids
http://thexodirectory.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Giant-Hunstman-spider-Heteropoda-maxima.jpg
that pun was NOT intended tbh
spiders aren't evil
or are they
/me no sound
not me
I do :3
00,10totaly understand that.
hornets scare me
bees? naw
hornets are more scarier than spiders
BEeeeeeeeeeeeees
13we had a nest in our roof..
i kill Carpenter bees
The only time I've been stung is when I bothered them and then only wasps or hornets.
Probably.
i had to kill carpenter bee's because they eat our shed
good thing they dont sting
^
when i was six i once closed my hand without noticing that a wasp flew into it at exact this moment. oh the pain
We had a wasp nest in our brick wall, had to burn them out
noone
08,01Shizuka: a carpenter bee?
still not scared of bees though
VHAT HAS SHIENCE DONE?!?
or wasps
Saturn
I bet he's under the other 10 yard line...
only FEMALE carpenter bee's have stinger,and they dont come out of the nest
Why would you bury a corpse where someone might find it anyway.
eman
i barley know anything
thats the only bee i know anything about
MC knows too many facts about bees.
ya
I mean, besides the Mythbusters
is it poisonus or something?
we should watch a twilight zone episode sometime
But they're the Mythbusters
They defy logic
I know the feeling shizu....I crushed alunimum soda cans when I young and the soad ALWAYS attracted bees and now I cant STAND them...
yep
Bah! two hours to kill and no cash for food :(
EVER!
Not that I could stomach fast food right now
Try this at home you say Jamie?
There was a wasp nest in a metal bin at the local park when I was like, 12. We sprayed it full of deoderant and set it alight.
3Hi, I"m just lurking.
13EVER
Cruel but effective.
I saw Kari!
!
Besides, playing heads and volleys is hard to do when surrounded by wasps.
whasthat?
this a revisited episode?
He thinks like Pinkie Pie!
Quack.
I suppose I could go borrow headphones...
13that's great
6_9
00,10s2ep1 myths revisited
bees don't bother me
08,01actually, there is a kind of insect i'm not too fond of: wasps
oh I remember this
Wasps however I can't stand
everything else is yellow
Dat fig leaf.
WASPS ARE BITCHES
08,01Ingwaz: i *love* bees
08,01i keep bees
them and Hornets
08,01or rather, i used to keep bees
honeybees are boss
00,10Oh hi young tory
08,01otakon: hornets are actually pretty docile
Saturn
but passing solid urine would be painful
TORY....he looks young
08,01Ingwaz: i used to have a coupl eof hives in my garden
tell that to my couple dozen scars i have from wasps

08,01otakon: hornets or yellowjackets?
08,01because yellowjackets are aggressive, but most other wasps and hronets aren't
Saturn: both, only bees don't bother me
I hit wasps with things.
Grant is best built team mythbuster.
wasps aren't that dangerous
HAHAHA
Shirtless Jamie again
they never sting
08,01Shizuka: how are you about moths?
shoo them away and everrything's fine
13squish
08,01but you'd need to be stung a *lot* of times
08,01:(
One time I was following my brother through the woods and my brother stepped on a yellowjacket nest. The first thing the ENTIRE neest saw at once was me....I got about 110 stings that day
Dem anomalous readings.
/me 08,01breeds moths
well, sawrms only come at you if you're dumb enough to kick a nnest
you don't kick waps nests
"...rectal?"
