They are cuter than... The cricket eating that carrot!
Scootaloo's had an episode coming for a long time now.
/me backs away
/me makes things awkward for TOY_PON3
PhrozenFire: but that thing is adorable.
:(
/me helps makes things awquard
emangamer: You're no Zuro
and s3 is confirmed to at least still be in production
Also, it's nice that we'll have more than 13 episodes in S3.
/me comes up behind TOY_PON3
indeed she did Kammerjunk, the CMC have really really grown on me, scoots in particular
I love all things that make people feel scared or grossed out!
Amnesia monsters look like Paris Hilton took a cleaver to the face.

Heck... I would date the grudge if she were real!
00,03No surprise there!
Scoot-Scootaloo: Hello, slowpoke.
I'm so bucking tired of homework

In Soviet Russia homework is tired of you.

Okay...somepony added me and I don't know who in the hell they are.

Hey guys, did you hear that we'll see Derpy in S2?
Like seriously I don't know them!
SO you gotta go? D=
Meanwhile: i keep reading your name as part of your sentances -_-
KwakLad: Mission accomplished.
emangamer: Dead seriously. All my money.
TOY_PON3 I'm going to do you like my homework! I'll slam you on the table and do you all night long!
O_O
KwakLad: Meanwhile, somewhere in equestria...
PhrozenFire: ....
That was disturbing

Ok, where is Pinkie in this painting. http://dash.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132977965419.jpg I can't find her.
:)
Meanwhile: always with a pause though
11,01My computer just did something funny.
0,14Told a joke?
I'm asian so you know that I will do homework like that.
0,14XD
Okay do I delete this person or do I keep them as a friend?
Krakass: its not pinkie, its rainbow dash, shes up in the top left in one of the windows
PhrozenFire: you mean give up halfway through, spill ink on the spine and go to bed?
Krakass: shes very very tiny
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-slowcord.jpg

Dammit PhrozenFire tell me what to do!

Trixie needs to get hit by a meteorite and pulverised into a fine powder.
You need 4G
its slowpoke!
Krakass: i wasnt aware there were more than just RD, i never really bothered to give it a thorough look
PinkiePieCopy: SlowCord
Meanwhile: I know how you feel about Trixie. Please just let me fan out.

PhrozenFire: Somepony added me and I don't know who they are...it's awkward I mistaked him for PinkiePieCopy
:(
PinkiePieCopy: crap my bad

Quite surprising that "cute mlp" gives you anything but cute
/me hugs emangamer "whats up my good man?"

Cipher|Homework: What are you talking about?
LOL...what a dick move whoever did that
It was you wasn't it.
I don't know what's going on..
Nittany_Discord: so whats the plan?
Boo.
0,14There was a guy on ponychan who claimed that he was working on the show and gave an impromptu interview
TOY_PON3: nothing. don't worry about it.
Thank you Cipher|Homework
I didn't get into MLP until Season 2 Episode 4. By that time, EQD was around and I thought it was "the place to be"
Is there anything streaming now? or am i not loading anything?
Never did know about ponychan
11,01Shit
There is no stream
Comment of the moment right there.
Ok i see. thanks
flutter_spin: its the less evil version of 4chan...granted it can still be evil

Yeah that pic is just awesome when I saw it on EQD
Guys, Emangamer is pregnant.
11,01One of my 9001^9001 wireless connection drops.
It's...a rather high number.

PhrozenFire: that wasn't even funny
11,01Congrats emangamer!
Yet I never did like the frizzle hair.
Nittany_Discord, are you borrowing internet from Otakon?
I'm never funny
11,01He might be borrowing from me.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Are you sewious?
Nittany_Discord: so portal or L4D2?
11,01Anyway, better fetch a restreamer.

This is music! It's not the mainstream *squee* that plays!

i can do L4D and L4D2... so which is it?
CriticKitten: we wanted to believe.
...My friend was right! She was in the snowglobe!
Shouldn't these sites usually check these guys out before they do something like that? At least in the Jayson Thieson interview on Reddit he proved who he was through his Twitter
Midnight I only have L4D2 So that will be the one prolly
lol
Naw. I think EQD just posts anything and everything
Seriously can anyone else taste salsa?

TOY_PON3 Midnight tempest and I are doing L4D2, You should join us!
ZOMBIES!
I trusted the mods! AND NAO THIS!
In all honesty, I haven't looked at the actual ponychan thread. I just read the bits on EqD
Jaketehsnake: But PinkiePieCopy doesn't have L4D2 :(
we should watch 300
We should dig a moat.
Let me play one game with him then I'll go with you guys
Trixie returning should've been an instant tipoff that something was wrong, she's an obvious one-shot character in the same vein as Gilda XD
we should all burst into flames

0,14...otakon, don't make me ask you about your wellbeing
Bye Derpy_Hooves
I missed all the spoilers for "Smile" and I have to say, glad I did.
0,14^
I've been having a hell of a time finding blindbag ponies. Give me a box of 'em
otakon: how's your wellbeing?
0,14same here
Meanwhile: farly good

SaxyPretender: you did it for me. Where's the fun in that.
oh really?
how so?

0,14...true
wellbeing?
I don't get it
I don't ask "how high" when you say jump SaxyPretender.
0,14>ask about well being
0,14>answer fairly okay
Is there anything else the master desires, perhaps a pencil, bitches love the pencils
Answer farly ok*
0,14the joke would be "unlike your connection"
Saxy: You meant to ask him "How's your sex life?", didn't you?
oh
0,14nope

/me throws the rules into the portal

twilight jumps in after the rules
/me brings LadyCanary back from the brink of distruction
Stop right there criminal scum.
/me opens up a miniature portal inside him returning him and LadyCanary back

So much ping -3-
huh, i only just noticed the dots on the bronystate timer are coloured for the mane 6

/me extends his love and tolerance to CanarysHat to get him to calm down and get off LadyCanary's head
Nothing is being streamed.

/me remains on LadyCanary's head
1,3I ate it
/me starts digging a stream
Anyone up for a How To Train Your Dragon vote in a couple of weeks, or has that become old.
emantrollslayer: I know you're jealous of CanarysHat but at this point I think it's her choice whether he stays or not.

hello bronies
THE CHAMP IS HERE
jello mello
Hallo thar bronystate (O_O)/"
0,14oh hai Randall1160
Ohai!
On kinda late today D:
I guess i see it that way becuz my ex was a Tom Boy, anything girly or weeak she shunned :D
but at east I'm here!
least*
hi Randall1160
Champeh!
I was watching episode 18 and I decided to draw pinkie.
go figure.
^_^
Ohai!
Rainbow Dash is still and always best pony
MASF123: It's a kids show. Her sexuality hasn't been mentioned, and it won't be.
0,14^
^^
Hi everypony
ARGH
0,14oh hai Purple`Prose
If you want to interpret that way, more power to you.
sexual orintation is not inapropriate
CCCP speaks the golden truth
Hi Purple`Prose!
hi Purple`Prose
11,01Purple`Prosie
Rainbow Dash > Everything else
The directors were smart when it came to the 'Hearts and Hooves' episode, and didnt include any of the mane 6 at all! :D (well, barely included)
It's inappropriate for the intended demographic
RD isn't lesbo, she hides her femenism, but sometimes shows it in a few episodes
RaveBrony: execpt Twi
no stream? post ponies
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmHAqgAFt6E&feature=g-vrec&context=G2f2e759RVAAAAAAAABQ
Weeeeellll . . . Purple`Prose, how nice of you to join us ;).
Thats what i meant by barely :P
>_>
didn't faust openly state that she wasn't a lesbian
Im not really a huge fan of RD tho....
Faust even said she wasn't a lesbo...
Indeed she did, Mello_Jello
RaveBrony: :o
that's not going to stop fanon
unfoundbug: I am now 20% more manly.
Ohai, btw.
hihi
I like partying and sophistication!! Therefore i favor Vinyl Scratch and Rarity :) (but i have no Favorite pony)
If you could be anypony who would it be?
/me fires canon cannon at bronystate.
ohai unfoundbug
nittany livestream?
/me <3's Twilight, Fluttershy and Rarity
MASF123: Pinkie pie
Sexuality doesn't belong with my ponies.
:O Wa
canon cannon NEVER misses
Placebo: yes it does spike has a crush on rarity
This is how I spend my night at bronystate: http://i.imgur.com/CXcd7.jpg
Pinkie Pie for me, or Rainbow Dash, she's fast and can fly
Twilight is mai waifu, Fluttershy is weaponized moe, and Rarity makes me giggle.
see, that would mean giving up skyrim on account of my new hooves
which is a definite hell no
Dashie_Dashie Darn toot'n!
CCCP: Spike isn't a pony, Rarity doesn't return the attraction. /argument
I favor ALL ponies....i can never choose a Favorite...
11,01No-one's livestreaming.
wow, thats gonna be a big change
08,01because i have sectionals
11,01I couldn't.
Placebo: she has anattration for that stupid prince pony
08,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: sad and with a cello
TheGreatAndPowerfulT or a cello
Dashie_Dashie, you have the right idea
08,01RaveBrony: sectional rehearsals
ahhh
/me doesnt wanna go to school tomorrow TT_TT
08,01which kinda sucks
I am one chapter away from finishing my fic!
Ah, very nice :)
How much is a Pinkie Pie toy?

Anyone else find it odd that there is a lack of stallions in Ponyville? Or is it named Ponyville because.... of all the ponies?

Mid, wait for me.
/me glomps TheGreatAndPowerfulT
0,14well, generally the lack of stallions can be attributed to the fact it's a girl's show and as such, they don't tend to include many male characters
maybe they recycle?
:3
:3 hai TOY_PON3
Possibly.
you know what i mean
:P
But seriously, is Big Mac like the only male?
Stallions are not attractive
No
it's simple really, half of them were abducteed by aliens for testing.
What about the doctor?
It is a reverse China effect in Equestria. :3
what about caramel?
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT :3
From Secret of My Excess and Read it and Weep?
There is a war going on, so a lot of the males are gone
big mac, caramel, braeburn, soarin, the dr
what about mr breezy
But only Big Mac played a major role
there are lots of stallions, just more mares... i find this acceptable
The doctor had a large speaking part in Read it and Weep.
Sure Dr. Hooves too
Kind of like how there isnt any male NPCs in Hyperdimension Neptunia
Shhh you.. caramel is best pony
If any of you guys know that game
am i the only one that sees a black screen?

I figure that Zecora encounters one of the forest dwelling trolls, and then tells Applebloom about it, and then she tells Applejapplejapple, and then eventually Celestia hears about it, and it just snowballs outta control.

Nah, you see, Applebloom would just break into Zecora's hutt again and try making some sort of potion or lotion.
No soundboard?

the 0 in fahrenheit is simply the lowest tempreture the guy could make
very arbitry
Yeah it's still not doing it, I'm gonna have to take desperate measures
Celsius and Fahrenheit are within a few degrees of one another once you get into the -50 and 0 range.
So much cocaine!

00,100_o
???
I don't even WANT to know.
alright I'm gonna go to sleep
uhhhh
gnight OneTrickPony
I've got a pair of 2TB drives in my tower for stuffs.
Also it's making me hungry.
night OneTrickPony
ooh the wonky bridge
/me remembers dat
I thinki've been on it
/me has no external :(
Gmorning ponies~
MIDNIGHT: Yeah, I have more than just that 1 TB, but that's what I've reserved for media. Filled 600-700 GB so far.
Mornin' Starflash.
right by the Tate modern
right now i'm just limited by my internets
mornin Starflash!
Oh, wait.
moved into the country and the best thing is phone line DSL @ 1.5mbps
I've actually filled 979 GB so far.
00,10Placebo framerate and sound quality can change file size alot.
Oh, well.
freaking stone age internet
Ohai MahBoi777 :3 mfw you're always online
^
Starflash: He's always watching us.
Torrent ETA is 2 hrs
/me glomps Starflash
Starflash: LOL ALWAYS
/me glomps SuperBrony64|Zzz
make sure to get the color corrected S1 :D
i have Season 1 on my hard drive and its almost 20 gb
wah! wah wah!... move to NZ and then complain....
go to sleep SB :3
00,10and yeah over 2TB here.
MIDNIGHT: Is that your actual download speed?
Nah, I usually average 80-120KB/sec
Ah.
was gonna say, that's some DAMN high Dsl.
2TB? you mad, Sumi? o.o
lol
I think the household limit for downloads is 60 a month
my down speed= 1.7 MB/s
1.5 here -_- I thought that was much
*GB
50 Mbps upload and download here.
I don't really think I need more.
when i have money (hopefully soon) i'ma setup a 4/5 tb fileserver
Mb is also not the same as MB
So, 1.5Mbps is =~190KB
per second
192KB
MIDNIGHT: ah, the gibibytes vs gigabytes vs gigabits vs AAAAAAAAAAAAA(horrid convetions)
I pay ~50 bucks a month for a 10 Mbps download.
1.6MB/s down, 254.8 kB/s up
~16mbit/s here
I used to have fancy pants Comcast, 105Mbps
could download at like 7MB/sec
though i usualy only get 1.2MB/s
My personal tower just has 3 TB because the 1 TB disk contains my Windows installation and I don't feel like re-installing just now.
But I hope to upgrade it soon.
I blew out my bandwidth limit and TB drives so fast...
S1 looks fine in 420, honestly.. STill think I need the 20 gig download just to show my brony-hood, though.
when you can download entire series in like, 2 hours... >.>
1.41Mbps :3
00,1015 down 2 up here.
after s2 is done i'm going to get 1080 of both seasons and rewatch them
Placebo: I can't accept episodes if they're not 1080p.
Sumica: bits or bytes?
Comcast sent me angry letters cause I ended up downloading like, 600GB in a month
which is apparently bad
Dayum
00,10mbps
MIDNIGHT: Do ho ho.
Surprise they didn't send you an angry copyright lawsuit.lol
My father doesn't really do anything with our Internet but download films and shows.
encrypt your torrenting! :D
i'm on a Lenovo G550 laptop, 250 gb HDD, 4096 mb RAM
00,10glad century link dont give a shit about my usage.
its actualy fine to force encryption on torrents now, bugger all people dont
00,10I hardly ever close stream or mirc
I have Century Link, but, when you only have 1.5Mbps... can't always have the stream up :(
My download speed is 0.48Mbps with the stream going...
ISPs that only care about bills getting paid roughly on time, ftw.
I can't wait to move back to the city.
Comcast only cares about usage if you're like, in the top 10 power users for your area
Cause there have been months where I download only 4-500GB/month, and got no letter.
00,10I kinda lucked out as I am realy close to a net hub for them.
I had Century link when I lived with my folks.
On Suddenlink now.
fancy internetz
/me is going to close FF soon to streamline torrent
I'm actually surprised I can handle having both the Stream up and SWTOR running, but, then again it is like 3am
the moment I try to load a webpage though everything bogs down XD
00,10Sounds like Mr freeze
lol
Mr Skeez
00,10I do that all the time MIDNIGHT
I usually have TF2 and WoW running at the same time because I never, ever close anything.
the whole chatroom is talking in computerfancy! =w= oh noes
Hence why I have 100-something tabs open in Firefox.
I've been spoiled on Comcast
going back to DSL is like... going back to 56k when broadband first came out :(
Starflash: LOL
00,10moar
AHMS STRATE
MahBoi777: Its true~ ;a;
I know, lol
Well, at least he doesn't consider his ego important.
RainBow Dash Seal of 20% cooler

Wow, they're aggressive.
pokemon the first movie was a good movie
would it count as an a or b movie?
It was?
well i enjoyed it
00,10I think it can pass as an A
Not being a fan of Pokémon, I found it a bit meh. Then again, it's more or less all I know about Pokémon.
I think I still have it on VHS.
it was financaly suesfyll
/me herp spel
I have the DVD somewhere
The First Movie topped the box office charts in its opening weekend, grossing over US$163 million

00,10I tont think they blow any thing up this time.
Aww.

I still want one. Adorable.
ScootaChicken: A bring broke once when soldiers marched over it.

"Go the fuck to sleep."
Best children's book ever, by the way.

A male covered the Smile song
....

nothx
Lol. He did a good job, too.
smile was a meh song to me too :(
/me sleep walks into chat
it was one of my favs. from season 2
Oh. :(
Lesson Zero is still my favourite episode.
/me grabs StickySyrup and sleep walks back into room
XD
/me hugs Xeli
and Drake
see ya
It just has a certain je ne sais quoi.
/me oh god... where am I going
04bye NS
/me hugs sadly
04I'll see you Friday
00,10you gonna sleep with SB it seems
later StickySyrup
have fun
Lesson Zero is only liked because of Twilight's Psycotic breakdown
00,10I recomend you just lay back and think of england.
/me he has a comfortable bed
MASF123: That's what the episode features, yes.
I loved The Last Roundup, beyond the OMG DERPY factor
/me sits StickySyrup in chair in corner of room
It also reminds me of Napoleon XIV, so that's good.
they need more rowers
Wow, nothing else not even the morals or animation were mention
/me HELP MEH
be bravesoldier
ohai derpy_pony
hi Phase4
Dat SB
its like being in fluttershys shed
/me sleep talks 'You. Watch. Boogey colt. I sleep -___-'
I would call it Twilight's best episode
MASF123: The animation features in all the episodes, and while the moral is important, I already knew it.
StickySyrup we decided not to speak of that :3
Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 is another favorite, liked the musical number, Rainbow rage, and Applejack at the end with her Dear Princess Celestia bit. :D
/me goes into bed and lays down
/me reads you go the fuck to sleep
/me gets up to sleep hug StickySyrup
/me whispers
The animation improves episode after episode, I thought somepony would atleast notice the change
guys.. what do I do
StickySyrup: ...sleep i supose, your kinda stuck there
go the fuck to sleep
ok then...
cool
00,10I have commented on that many times MASF123
StickySyrup: You're cozy and warm in your bed, my dear.
Please, go the fuck to sleep.
do it
00,10between 202 and 203 is amazing.
lololol
they reuse lots of elements
srsly though, s b: bed
I must have not been here when you said it, @Sumica
I mean, the animation is cool and all, and the style is appealing and part of the reason why I watch, but.... I don't just watch a show because it looks pretty.
yeah seriously... and release me
00,10Probably not.
lol someone took a dump in the kitchen
all of them
4 germs...oh my...
00,10A good example is twi walking through ponyville, where she is coming at the camera.
/me locks door, swallows key, and falls asleep in bed
The windows are dark in the town, child. The whales huddle down in the deep.
/me breaks the window
/me runs
I'll read you one very last book if you swear, you'll go the fuck to sleep.
/me jumps out of SB's window
Moral of this story?
dat self defenistration
POOP IS EVERYWHERE
^
The morals are important in my book, even if I already knew the morals it is good to be reminded again
SHIT is every where
StickySyrup, you're in one of those cartoons where the reso;ution to the episode is never good. Deal with it.
lick on the agar and you will be more of these germs when you breed it
So that meens I can take a dump on my sisters toothbrush
-be +see
00,10Little did they know some one wanted to test a myth invloving the garbage disposal

RainbowJack: He is the host, the man you call Ghost.
He's a melting pot of friendship.
yeah
MELTING POT OF ALCHOLO
i love his hate of brony's
He's a troll.
because that makes them troll him

So it's trolls trolling trolls.
It's either a lose-lose situation or a win-win one.
but sometimes ghost has a point

Dashie_Dashie: DING
DING DING DING
So what? There's only like 3 people alive?
Everybody's dead, Dave.
=)
everypony
all of them
but there is cake
so not all bad
Lies. THE CAKE IS A ...No, not going to finish that.
The cake is a pie.
Mods are being spys right now, using their cloak and dagger.
shhh....
=O
Kammerjunk: Good save.
Hey boys, it's a SPAH!
Gentlemen.. *snort snort*
Flutteryshy your putting me in a bind, Rainbow Dash what is on your mind?
Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time. Must remember Applejack's duds must shine!
I'm not sure if those are the exact lyrics.
XD
Piece by piece, snip by snip
Shoulders back....?
.....something.....hip.
I only remember the Something Broke parody of Art of the Dress.
ok
All we ever want is in decision, all really like is what we know
Gotta balance style with adherence
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r-kg6T2cGA&feature=related
Making sure we make a good appearance
But if you simply have to fudge it, make sure it stays within our budget!
TRIXIE
JUNK
Gotta overcome intimidation, remember it's all in the presentation!
Well...I really only came for that.
/me Leaves
YOU GO
Have fun, then.
No...you did it wrong. :O
It's...you stay....I go........
I love you......:'(
But I'm not leaving ._.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83Iu3RBQWU
/me leaves
/me is still here
wait
is that an iron giant and lost in space refference?
and more than one other movie
im bored
/me kills it with fire
Good morning everypony!! :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K83Iu3RBQWU i think the refference density in this vid is greater than the creators thought it was
ohai RaveBrony
New looney toons is... meh.. I prefer the old ones.
its a little heavy with the iron giant parody
:o
http://youtu.be/iX0cGftqbrg is the origional scene (WARNING: IRON GIANT SPOILER, DONT WATCH IF YOU PLAN TO SEE)
that actualy makes posting the vid a little pointless
herp derp obvious
/me should be in bed
God i loved the Iron Giant...
PHase4, why dont you get some sleep then :)
*Phase4
because i'ma stay up a bit more
Alright then :P
that scene with the missle is one of the best in any film ever imho
^
Why does FIMFiction always go on maintenance when I try to read fanfics?
Lol
I really like some of the fanfics... and thats REALLY Big for me seeing as how i hate reading
It's the exact opposite for me. I've read my entire life.
I agree RaveBrony, couldn't give two shits about it in school.. but when it comes to ponies.
Well, not literally, but you know what I mean.
imokwiththis.jpeg
Lol!! :D
That's also why I have the collection I have.
You awaken with a headache and fuzzy memory , last thing you recall was a bright flash outside. You are lying on the floor and sunlight filters in through the window! (anyone up forsome rpg-ing? im bored like that)
Macbeth was honestly the only story I liked in high school.
well story/play
MLP roleplays make me depressed.
I went to the site to take a look at it, read one sentence of a fic....then lost about 45minutes of my day (45 minutes wel spent)
Macbeth is good, I like it.
I never read Macbeth....
its not mlp , yet
>yet
Even worse.
I love how I was the only one in my school that knew what minecraft was and I brought in my flashdrive with minecraft on it.
at some point there may be ponies
Exactly.
me and two other friends were the only ones that played it.
Lol :D
So depressing.
I found this incomplete 63 chapter lately. That was my day.
I put it on the schools hard drive, 3 months later I walk into my library, 15 freshman are playing it.
Well, some of it.
I dont know how to role play through text, TrixieMuffin :(
walked up to them said "you're welcome" and walked away like a boss
ohai TrixieMuffin
Nice :D
I miss the library from my school >_> the libriarians loved me.. let me do what ever I want, yelled at others for doing the same thing I did xD
must of been because I was a senior @_@
you just type what you do and thats it ....but noone wants to play apparently
I often roleplay through text, I love descriping in detail. But MLP roleplays make me so depressed.
ok its not mlp
you are a human
Mainly because I can't go there IRL.
...YET.
and telling more would be spoilers
What if.. heaven is what you picture it to be.. like if you thought it was equestria and it IS equestria.
never know .__.
ok never
Dashie_Dashie: That'd be awesome if I was a believer. Or, well, apathetic agnostic, but still.
no ponies other than on tv in the rp
everyone has their opinions. =p
:P
TrixieMuffin: Wouldn't it be a tad boring with only two people?
doesn't bother me.
Dashie_Dashie: Same for me. I don't mind people believeing what they will as long as they don't stick it down MY throat.
well Rave seemed interested , but noone else by he looks of it
Same, Dashie_Dashie
still im already bored so i might be a step up
and if im good at it others may join
The exception being Scientology.
Haven't seen them in years.
brb, i want some breakfast before the show comes on at 8 :P
what show RaveBrony =o?
Mlp, on the hub, lol
oh.. does the website stream it .__>?
Today's first episode is Winter Wrap Up :)
/me doesn't get the Hub.
I dont think so D: do you not get the hub?
Oh, well.
I'll just watch the 1080p episode I downloaded.
I really wish I had my old ATI program that let me watch TV on my computer stright from my cable box..
The Hub is like channel 1920 for me xD
well that's the HD one
aeiou
it's like.. channel 126 normally
Lol!
john madan
Its channel 125 for me
On an unrelated note, I really need to upgrade my fileservers hard drives. I dedicated 1 TB to video, and it's almost filled up.
O.O
hot damn Kammerjunk ._>
._.*
It's on 979 GB.
im going to continue , if anyone gets interested just join in
:P
I can't wait to build my custom computer when I get the money to :$
Dashie_Dashie: Building it yourself it much easier.
As you stand up, you notice the puddle you were lying in and an uncomfortable lump in your pants.
and when I get my appartment I want a two bedroom, one for my slumber, and another for my computer room which will be lined with ponies everywhere.
TrixieMuffin: Sorry, but wouldn't it be easier in another room? Maybe it's just my insatiable hunger for organising, but it'd just seem easier to overlook.
You are hungry like a wolf, and thirsty, how long were you out for ?
I'll be 20 on august 18th I need to move the hell out of my parents .__.
first i need at least 1 player , then we can migrate
Oh wow Dashe_Dashie :o
I'll play, but I think it'll be a bit boring alone.
otherwise ill just go back to being bored
post on ponychan
Pshh, my older bro is 19 and he doesnt plan on moving out anytime soon....
I WANT to move out xD
to think that me having a appartment to myself, and a computer room within that appartment with my new beastly custom bult computer and the room aligned with ponies..
*sigh* I await that day
Ill be 18 on May 4th :D cant wait to get my grad presents :$
my grad present was getting drunk and eating ribs.
immorethanokwiththat.jpeg
Woah! My parents wud Never allow that :D lucky! lol
It's because I'm german.. and my father.. well kinda doesn't care lol.
he plans on taking me to oktoberfest
But they promised me I can build a gaming computer and they'll pay for it :)
Guys anyone else interested in some chat rpg-ing ? ill leave it alone if we dont get at least 3 player because it gets boring too fast
Omg!! Ive seen seen so many vids of oktoberfest, looks awesome! But i dont know whether or not i can hold my liquor
liquor? my good sir, we're talking about the finest ale on the earth!
german beer is best beer.
I've never been to an Oktoberfest.
Alli have is an occsional pina colada...in a small wine glass...
I can kill a pint of Jack Daniels no problem.
:x
Eeyup.
I don't always drink, but when I do, it's Jack Daniel's.
almost killed an 8th of jack daniels by myself, until I keep missing shots at beer pong and just stopped.
Dat Twilight waking up too early
boredom it is , back to playing some flash games
oh that was a fun new years eve..
Kammerjunk: /)
:D
JD was my first liquor.
Dashie_Dashie: (\
loved it ever since =P
My first was a sort of liquorice drink, but I much prefer whiskey.
heh.. makes me wonder where wrek is.. I'd love to hear his drunken tales.
Ive tried many things :o
Dont get drunk tho, lol
I remember killing half a bottle of rum one night camping in the woods with a couple of my buddies.
ended up playing chicken with roman candles..
<-- got hit in the eye xD
o..m..g o_o
Yeah, I try to not drink TOO much. I can still keep my balance right up until I puke, but it's still not fun.
Note to self: Never kill a bottle of vodka with yourself and a friend in a cold garage playing beer pong.
many toilet hugs were given.
Note to self: Never kill a bottle of vodka alone.
That is all.
unless you're russian.
xD
True.
Thing is.. Russian vodka is WAYYYY more potent
more proof
3 months of winter coolness, and Awesome holidaaays!!
Sounds plausible.
Oh yeah, it's almost spring.
I know right :>
I'll be having Winter Wrap Up in my head for a while now, that's for sure.
I can't wait to start running again.
it gets too cold in new york to run now a days
We have this running machine at our home.
Stuff is neat.
I'm twilight sparkle when it comes to running.
I enjoy scenery
I enjoy nature as a matter of fact.
I enjoy occupying myself when running. So I put a TV on the opposite wall.
Lol xD
8 months ago I was a metal head, now I watch ponies.
not a single f**k was given.
Why not both?
I just moved to NY last fall....everyone said this years winter was weak
Electro/trance/dubstep/DnB/Hardstyle are my music types now.
My German teacher from Russia says that it easily got -40C in Moscow at winter.
to hell with that.
O.O
it's 4F where I am now.
I can deal with that.
but -40C?
CMON MAN
But you're not playing in the snow.
<-- hasn't had snow all winter
suprisingly.
^^
We had snow here.
I don't like snow.
you sound like my friend zack lol.
Too cold.
The first time i saw snow was about back in October O_o expected alot more...then was disappointed
My friend Peva just posted this on facebook >_<
much diabeetus was given
http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz9cs0pjuN1r59x0do1_500.png
Usually, it's just relatively cold here. Doesn't rain England-style, but doesn't snow a lot either.
I can not look at that picture for several seconds at a time.
Rainbow dash would never get diabeetus
pinkie pie would
Oh god... the diabeetus!!
i'm off to bed
Night Phase4, sleep well dood.
wainbwoom xD

hiya VioletVanilla
how is everyone today?
Not bad
How are you?
Still waking up here
hi otakon
pretty good
just woke up myself, god I've gotten lazy
used to wake up 4 am no prob, now I'm lucky if I don't sleep till 11
VioletVanilla, how are you today dear?
I hate when my monitor bugs out
and thus, I killed the chat which was barely clinging to life as it is..... R.I.P. #bronystate:'(
/me plays taps for Bronystate :(
/me crashes into the chat
ohai everyone
Oh hi.
How's it going?
Forward. As always.
I mean, it'd be weird if time suddenly started going backwards.
So it's going forwards instead.
Yeah
It'd be pretty cool though
How nice of Chronos to let time just flow forward like this.
It would.
wow.. chat is alive today
No, it's not.
You're seeing things.
lol
It's not that alive
Chat is alive Now :)
But it is awesome, that's for sure :D
Was dead 5 minutes ago
*crazy scientist* It's aliiiiiiiiivveeee
I swear, I am reading the weirdest Human in Equestria story I have ever seen.
*bronys
hi
ohai StickySyrup, TheMonstaMuffin and RaveBrony by the way
;)
Good afternoon, StickySyrup.
Well, it's a bit gray.
Hiya Jim :)
And dull. I don't have anything to do.
So it's a mediocre afternoon at best.
im playing Halo CE
But that sounds so silly.
ah chat is much more lively , do we have a stream yet ?
nope
Theres no stream it seems
brb need 2 pee
nope
i just streamed n the bathroom , but thats not as satisfying
when will the friday stream schedule update?
I've gotten the newsletter in emaill already
but it haven't been updated on the main page just yet
also i just read the Sweetypoo stuff and now i feel i need to shower
:) jus found a certificate of"unbridled illegiblity" from my A-level physics teacher "in light of my conssistently cryptic calligraphy"
Omg!! I forgot to bring back my desktop ponies when i turned on my comp :o :O

Hm...I would join you StickySyrup but have to write a cha[ter I've delayed for a while.
lol been there.... I was playing for ages and I forgot about my fanfic
but I did it in the end. Just hit 800 views
Nice.
I churned out about 4.5k words in my last two free lessons today so I should have it done by the end of today.
kl. When its finished send me the link. I will read it
Alright. It's about...atleast 50k words in the story so far.
I think it's going pretty well right now. Almost 17k views.
nice. Il download it and put it on my kindle
Mine is at around 14k words
hmmm
not much going on today
nope not rly
welp, anyway I'll brb need a shower, getting kind of grody otherwise
kk bye 4 now
Hey everypony! :D
hello Syndicate
hi Syndicate
Hi Everypony.
hi bronyzilla
Hi. Dead chat?
Yeah...
yeah it think so
Curses.
:P
ohai Bronyzilla
Hey there.
Hullo
hi
seems quiet today
Yep...
No stream. Chat on life support.
Afternoons seem to be quiet here
Sure do.
Quick, feed it muffins!
Yup they do
Derpy Day on 1st of March. :3
bleh...
:3
I shall be cross eyed most of the day and eat only muffins.
That will be a good day
BLEH...
Hay yeah.
I'm already home...why should I have to go back to class
I ate a double chocolate muffin today :3
Hi eman... What's with the Blahs?
Bleh*
ohai there emangamer
BLEH...
Bronyzilla: I dont want to go back to class...
How are you doing emangamer and Syndicate?
I'm good KwakLad. :D
Ohai Syndicate
Sweet
unofficial* I rwally can't spell today....
Bronyzilla: no. I just got back from class and I'll have to go back soon
Oh.
I just came back from school for the day.
lucky bastard
Pff.
Do you get to go home for lunch or something?
I do
Lucky. -,-
But motorbike is broken so i have to cycle instead
and it takes ages
Bronyzilla: not normally, but lab was short today
You ride a motorbike? :o
kk emangamer.
im learner i aint to pass my test by may
Awesome.
I ride a moped...;'
I ride a bike. :c
im learning on a really trashy chinese bike because i wanted a geared bike, and it was cheap think to have for 5 months
Yeah.
i already have a yamaha xj600 for after my test
Epic.
*googles
I'm not entirely sure why, but some guy just randomly came roller blading through my colleges cafeteria.
xD
:3
emangamer: my mate rides a 125cc ped, it fully exploded when he was riding it yesterday
Because roller blades are so awesome
I need a bike. -_-
KwakLad: the problem is that I dont wanna have to get a motorcycle liscens
ahh
Lol, most of the people here are in the middle of school. :P
emangamer: you looking to get a scooter?
how long have you had your CBT?
RAWRity: I already have one, but I cant drive higher than 50ccs
Hey guys...
emangamer: because of your age?
wah???
KwakLad: because anything bigger than 50ccs requires a morotcycle liscens
eeyup.
I have the license for a moped and car, but not motorcycle
OP deletes Facebook post because of you=successful trolling?
NC law says anything bigger than 50cc is a motorcycle
I dunno how the law works in the US otherwise i sjust suggest you get a motorbike
because NC is filled with dumb asses
RAWRity: so does SC
/me hugs RAWrity
hi RainBowJack
RAWRity: can I have a hug???
maybe
hi RAWRity
/me hugs Emangamer
RAWRity: wait...I dont want impotency
STAW AWAY FROM ME
Whut? RAWRity hug causes impotency
contact with my soul causes impotency. and female patter baldness
I don't even-
I make a living off of hugging as many people as possible on the street, then selling viagra to them online.
and my friend owns a wig shop, so it all works out.

RAWRity: That makes sense
Also, AWESOME picture
RAWRity: not as good as some of the other ones i've seen
wow i like that RAWRity okay so a hug with you is fine aslong as it doesnt mean much? (so our souls dont get close and/or such)
KwakLad: eeyup.
KwakLad: lol
dat empotency
xD
oh but i'd still feel bad giving a hug that means nothing
:P
do that really awkward Bro-hug thing that starts off with a handshake.
Super secret handshake of doom?
Ohh okay
RAWRity: seriously, how have we not met up yet?
emangamer: because You'd try to kill me with an ax if we did.
indeed.
you two live close to each other?
RAWRity: but I dont own an ax?
we need to try and get a UK brony meet going properly :/
KwakLad theres apparently a large one in a few months
in london
RAWRity: If we both go to bronycon would you wanna ride together so its not boring as hell?
Afraid I won't be able to go to Summer Bronycon.
someone apparently has a part in currently very basic prep for a manchester one (because manchester is in the middle of the uk ish so scotts can get there too)
RAWRity: how cuz?
but i know nothing much about that
I'm taking summer classes this year, so I'll most likely be working on schoolwork or some shit.

I've got a 2-year scholarship at my school that covers all my tuition, so I'm trying to shove as many classes as I can into that time period before I have to start paying.
RAWRity: c'mon...you'll get to meet lauren faust :D
I know, and I'd love to go, but what with the cost of it, and the time, and my school, I just won't be able to.

:(
So, wanna hear a scary story?
Yeah
I dropped my laptop last night.
Go for it.
Hello everypony :)
The worst possible thing D:
Ohai DainbowRash
I carry my laptop by gripping right over the screen, and nowhere else.
Hi DainbowRash
hhii eevveerryyppoonnyy!!
Howdy.
hi CCCP
i usually carry mine by the palmrest area under the keyboard, or by holding it closed, usually by the side
im so cold/warm and hungry
Hullo folk
and it suffered no damage to the hard drive or its performance that i can observe so far after 8 hours after the nightmare
hi KwakLad
Whats happening CCCP?
Oh yeah, if I have to travel somewere, I close it down, but if I just want to show my friend something, I just hold it at the top.
just one tiny crack on the corner
I dropped my laptop last night.
Hey evrypony
KwakLad: i'm just about to start searching for remixes
Howdy.
for anyone walking in just
now
i once had my laptop fall on my face
ohai Fazana
I had mine thrown at my knee
Capn_fisty: Now, hy'd you go and do such a silly thing?
Then you took a laptop to the face?
i'm talking a 3-foot drop
The_4th_Wall: That was silly of you.
i was lying on the floor with the laptop on my bed
my heart stopped for about 5 seconds
You aew indeed lucky no damage was sustained
because i was in here
The_4th_Wall: If so, you should see a doc
It isn't normal for a heart to stop for 5 whole seconds :o
and when i picked it up, the power was off
I remember a phone I once had. Dropped it down a staircase, still working. I think if I pulled that stunt today, I'd have some dozen bits to gather.
Not money, either.
must have been the physical shock
oh
Yeah, I had the thing happen with a baby alarm.
I accidently my phone into the toilet. I heard a SZZZCKKKT.
phone experience
Phones were much more fun when they were robust.
cricket's Huawei Ascend:
last night my computer tried to load that huge pony picture as the background, i derped so hard and force shut down my computer and when i tried to start it it wouldnt log on prperly and i had to spend an hour trying to fix it
POS
cricket's Huawei Ascend: Piece of Shit
then i played l4d2
Hmm
There was something I was gonna do
But I can't remember what now.
I have an iPhone 3GS now, planning on getting an Android when I inevitably break my iPhone.
i had one, dropped it only 5 inches, screen cracked.
The prospect of making your apps sounds good.
got another under warranty
Mine's been VERY lucky to survive a 2 meter fall from my doublebunk bed
I have a G1 iPod
Bought it release day ^_^
it dropped too. 3 inches, and it never turned on again
I have never owned anything before the first series of iPod Touch. Didn't care much for music before then.
I don't usemine for music
Only youtubeing at night when I should be asleep :D
Left Cricket for AT&T, now I have a Motorola Atrix
Now, I have music running virtually constantly, unless I'm watching something.
theres no sound from the stream :(
I<3 my Atrix
The_4th_Wall: Not heard of ANY of them.
i got itouch and i abuse it a little, the amount of times i have dropped it it must hate me
Well, only AT&T in F1, but I didn't know what company it was
I have an Otter Box Defender for it
Capn_fisty: Get a silicone cover.

I'm really unlucky, I got no milk in
one time, dropped my atrix while it was in the shell.
Kipkat07: Joke's on you. I like that song.

When I'm DJ, eeeyup

depends
thanks, but as long as it isn't original, I ain't happy :p
like how old is Twilight
74u2clhs1w2p
o shit.
ummm
no idea, but I know Fluttershy is one year older than Pinkie
CCCP: Not canon. But she's a student.
cccp no one knowa
knows
CountDoofus: lol
An extraordinary student, sure, but a student nonetheless.
what the hell is wrong with my internet
hmmm
as for the age question
Just been sent a video of my mates crasj
I'd say young adults.
I feel bad for twilight
yeah
some 1 link me to that song
My initial reaction: Hooollyyy crapp
maybe teens,pre-teens?
plz
I'd say they are somewhere from 18-25
test.
ofna01: That'd be the CMC.
They're fillies.
too old jim
tell that to jim he says their 25
Twilight is obviously older than the CMC.
are we talking human equivalent years then?
yep
right
Iwubponiez: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uzv1xlxyd4 think it's this one
He hit the barrier at a 45 degree angle and did a bunch of barrel rolls, before coming to a stop upside down
GUYS
pinkie pie is a ninja
if you didnt know
yep
YOU DON'T SAY.
o;
and also a good singer
how is granny smith as old as when they started to settle is PonyVille?
nah
rainbow is
Guys! Pinkie Pie is a pony!
OH MY GAWH
didnt realise
I DIDNT KNOW THAT
also why are all of the main 6 such good fucking voice actors and amazing singers too?
CCCP: Granny Smith is actually Cronus in disguise.
Fazana what are you talking about?
Is this done in tablet?
Kammerjunk: lol
6 ponies, 4 voice actresses
seems legit
lol
If you aren't bothered, don't listen, but just incase anyone who was listening earlier
so i'd summerize the mane 6 are anywhere from 10-14
ThatsAShinySky: Wrek draws all his art with the mouse, IIRC.
Eeeyup
CountDoofus: its a lie the ponies are real
anyone agree with me?
10 noooooooooo 14 mmmaybe 16 ya 18 eeyup
ofna01: Not quite.
14-18
Well, Rarity has a job making dresses, I'd say they are quite older
14-20
rarity is just really mature
16-20
she is british after all
I'd say the CMC are around 10-12, converted from human years.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIZn8-4wqqw I think not
CMC?
Cutie Mark Crusaders.
But they still are kind of youth-ish, due to Celesia acting like a mother figure for them actually
ah
cmc 7-10
The mane six are roughly in their twenties
Mabey they are like flies and die with in like 3 days and they are only 1 day old
lolno
how the
I'd say the CMC are about 13-4 as they havent got their CM, yet others have
CCCP: wat
hmmm
how are you gonna save equestria?!
13-4?
WHAT?
Kammerjunk: i dont know
13-4?
13-14
ah
i would say 6-12
i always pictured them alot younger
noooo not 13-14
13-14, usual time before someone hits puberty.
i say 6-10
some one should email Lauren Faust and ask her
anyone?
go for it CCCP
i could
yeah
:P
anyone who can
awesome music :D
ofna01 : i would if i knew her email adress
google is your friend CCC
ill see
i think she said they are teenagers before
i seen her comment in DA
i dont think their teens
if I were to guess, I'd say around 20ish
Dash i can understand that,she's got that rebellious attitude,but the rest,i dont think so
Hold on, I'll check my Faust pictures, see if I can find it.
18-20 i would believe
cant find
still no wub
well lets look at this the average life span of a pony is 25-30 years
AHA! unicorn
in real life
I found it on EQD instead.
as i said,the oldest is fluttershy supposedly,but i think dash may be older
The animation FAQ.
CCCP: It's easier to compare them to the human age
yeah
Jim: i know
Me and RainbowJack are having a strange convo.
I'll spare you the full copypasta and post this.
"...I guess I sort of justified it in my head that they could be childlike young adults."
caare to explain shiny?
young adults
so thats teens
mabey they are all dead and they are ghosts
Dont forget, animation years arnt equivelant to human years, Ash is still 13 and hes been on tv for about 12 years
Young adults is young adults.
Teens is teens
HOWEVER
im always called a young adult,and im 15
I figure Rarity's the oldest, since she's the only one with a decent business
why are we even talking about this who needs to know their ages anyway :P
Beforehand, she says that "the ponies' ages were left intentionally undefined. I like to think of them as having maturity levels anywhere between 12 and 18..."
Ash was 10, he's about 14 now
I know
Ofna01 you really are a young adult
think about simpsoons
18 is an adult
Been around for ages
teen starts at 13
She then goes on to say that maturity is different than age.
Maggie always has and still is a baby
i think they are 30 year old single women
I'm a young old fart
same here count
im a stupid ol' fart.
not old.
:D
they dont go to school so theyre probably ove 18
I'd just link you the page, but I'm not sure I'm allowed to link to EQD.
kip
Since a stream is running.
this pony looks great
who is it?
GUYS LETS PLAY A GAME: WHOS THAT PONY?
depends how far up their School goes up in age
Rarity

just picture a flash mob dancing and singing smile smile smile :O
/me sneaks up behind otakon and whacks him with a foam mallet. Hai!
my pick-up line: "Hey. Do you like My Little Pony? No? See ya."
Jadeite is one of the rarest minerals on the planet, I figure the only way your internet could be as bad as it is is if it runs on something that almost doesn't exist.
/me is unaffected
Meanwhile: hmm, not quite as funny as the others is all. Now if you said Unobtainium I would have chuckled THEN said shaddup
Idk where the Unobtainium thing comes from.
so noones streaming then
Kee-rect.
/me crosses the streams, then vanishes
Meanwhile: Avatar, the MOST FRIGGIN ADVERTISED DANCES WITH WOLVES WITH SMURFS REMAKE MOVIE EVER!
otakon: I'll remind you that the only time I have ever seen Avatar was on an 8 hour plane flight.
at least avatar looked shiny...
Where my tv got stuck and I couldn't change it.
Meanwhile: and thus you are damaged
Avatar, on repeat, for 8 hours.
so, what... saw it twice?
Meanwhile: that explains your lack of emotion
How long do you think that movie is?
Midnight_Tempest: good one
it's about 2 and a half hours long IIRC
but it feels longe
r
DAMN YOU TYPOS
i like movies that are about 3 hours long, or longer
Imagine watching a bad movie. Then watching it again straight after, and then again.
Hi
is anyone streaming?
While you're in a cramped chair surrounded by morons and with hospital class food.
I don't think anyones streaming
Given the option, I'd rather be waterboarded.
:o
i'm not getting a stream over here! HALP!
refresh :P
dit that
:o
Meanwhile: you wanna watch bad movies? then watch all the odd numbers Star Treks... those are alot worse than Avatar could ever be
repeatedly
Refresh and learn that nothing is streaming.
over the course of the last hour
Midnight_Tempest: I'll stick to the series.
Oh yeah, nothing is streaming O.o
I just have a froen picture

Cool alexxm
Ponies*

No wait, wrong scene
xD
he said he'd watch the first episode
And as is always the case, one is all it takes.
Actually it took me 2 episodes
Ah but you watched 2 episodes.
Suited for Success wasnt very good
imo
You started with Suited for Success?
I didn't actually become a brony after the first episode, but watching the first episode made me watch another one, and then another one, until I finaly became a fullgrown brony
eeyup
I watched the very first episode.
1,3I like suited for success, but I've been in situations like that before
Around halfway in, I knew this show was for me.
Then I watched Ticket Master
You're weird.
"Oatmeal, are you CRAZY?" is what finally got me
Why do all the B movies suck?
i read a fanfic and that started my bronyness
i started my friend on the two parter
kidzrul434: because that's kinda the point
1,3because people have it in their head that a B movie has to be bad
All B movies don't suck. Ip Man was for example great
Emphasise kinda
1,3Ip Man was awesome
I just watched them all in a couple of days....my eyes were glazed over by the end of that
not true revenge of the nerds was good, or that was an A movie uhmm
Shortly after I became a brony, I showed my cousin a picture featuring Dashie and Applejack I spent 5 minutes on where I basically told him.
A week later, he said "20% cooler".
That Indian movie from last week was pretty good
Most B movies are amusing because theyr'e so bad they're good.
00,10Many times the B movie have been better then the A
Kirzstyrfe ip mans probably one of my dads faverite movies
But then you get the ones that are good and just on a low budget.
so bronies I'm going to see Rock of Ages on thursday
have fun
Have fun seeing Tom
1,3I like the B movies that are picked because they're cult classics, but not the ones that are picked because they're bad
bronies are like brownies but without the w
What is this week's B movie?
im tired
look at the home page
My non-brony friend called me a brownie once
1,3Space Mutiny
00,10Space Mutiny
1,3A movie is Serenity
Whats that about?
As far as bronyism goes. I was linked this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftvZFUg4HPc from an Escapist thread. Cue personal investigation, followed by watching every episode that was out at the time, followed by finding Equestria Daily, and by the time it was already way too late.
1,3I've never seen it before lol
:o
love night of pony
Meanwhile: thats funny, i was in to touhou before ponies
I have no idea what touhou is.
00,10it's abount....132 min long
this was the first thing i saw http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J4LCXbUy6w
are we seeing the mst3k version or the actual movie
1,3regular, you all get to mst3k it on your own :p
Meanwhile: series of bullet hell shooters
i would show you the first mlp thing that i saw, but i would get banned

I give up trying to figure out what's going on.
Buff Drinkslot
The first mlp fanific I read was Sweet Apple Massacre:(
Jim knows
MST3K Meanwhile... thats whats happening
Idk what that is either.
Jim: Brohoof/)
why do fanfics have to be so disturbing
(\
Jim never knows at home...
mystery science theatre 3000 meanwhile...
Still don't know what that is.
I don't get it. What is with the diabetus joke?
Meanwhile: for the love of PONIES you do not know what you are missing, go to youtube and look it up
No.
flutter_spin: it's from Edward Brimely saying it like DIA-BEET-US
What am I looking up?
and the fact most of the time ponies are just so sweet
Thats how my grandma says it
ooooh o.o
brb
F1uttershy: depends on the fanfic.
/me slowest response of the day
Yeah.
I have like 40 fanfics I'm waiting to read and another 30 I'm waiting to update.
Not all fanfics are bad.
Yeah, still don't get the joke
I would write fanfiction but i suck at writing:(
I forget most of the fics I'm reading until I see them updated in eqd's story posts.
At least now I know the reference, what poor reference it is
I've written fanfics, but I've never released any.
I was just bored.
stream?
Nope.
That would be interesting to read sometime Kammerjunk
:/
Ha ha.
Niet nah no nope
No, it wouldn't.
Fanfics are good as long as they arent rated M
Mostly, it's just my headcanon being a lunatic.
Most of the time at least
back

I was almost expecting to see Drake on

You fail at being away
Yeah I know
It's 6:40am though
You set SAIL FOR FAIL!

you're wonderful
Ponies. Ponies never changes.
I know.
I agree.
Have you guys ever tried zooming all the way in on Wrek's larger pictures?
Like "Badass Fluttershy".
Jim: lol
Reign of Thunder? That's the new Mech game? It feels exactly like Mechwarrior Online... and both look silly
Wrek has some serious attention to detail. I make it a game for myself to thoroughly scan every large picture he makes.
Hawken might actually be worthwhile
What's his DA again?
huh... mechwarrior online... never heard of it, and i love the battletech universe o.o
dat SuperBrony64
pic
Mechwarrior Online is supposed to be a F2P game coming out. It is an MMO which will follow the timeline.
The problem is that they are starting it as an "arena"
There will be no PvE content on release
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TlTn-vhmqTY/Tz16zApvviI/AAAAAAAAfQA/unl5rvPINAs/s1600/another_day__s_end_by_tsitra360-d4pooja.jpg
Reign of Thunder is brought about by the guys who did MechAssault, also F2P, but is setup as an arena game too.
Basically a free-fly MechAssault version
I don't really like pvp content in those kind of games.
Pvp has a magical way of turning people into douchebags.
Hawken is a game that doesn't exactly fit with the Battletech universe but takes the "in a mech" seriously
all i wanna do is blow up some clans...
ohai Midnight_Tempest
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bfTc_0WMVY Reign of Thunder
hi Jim
/me hugs Jim and Midnight_tempest
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppGDwk_3FqA Hawken Gameplay
/me hugs RainbowJack back
So apparently the team behind Amnesia is making a new game due in fall.
Heya jim! Heya Rainbow!
http://derpy.me/OBmb1
Oh, Nelly.
hi ranDT2
Inb4 millions of LP videos.
i think what needs to be made is another MechWarrior game similar to MechWarrior 3... that was the best game of the series, imo
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orhOvbfyyJw Mechwarrior Online, however.. they are still in concept phases
guys you know what we need?
a good survival horror game
Amnesia?
so... another Silent Hill 2?
and let me stress that
a GOOD one
Guys.
Project zero
Tribes Ascend.
not AMY that game was SHITE
Yeah. I grew up watching my bro play Mechwarrior 2.
Tribes Ascend is so FUN.
of course Amy was bad the camera and the controls sucks
Oh god its turned into non ponies in this chat
I still want someone to stream amnesia.
SuperBrony64 streamed a little Amnesia a while back... i gave commentary while he played ^_^
Zero Punctuation threw Amy into the pit of despair. It was bad.
We need more Amnesia and Penumbra
Zero Punctuation throws most games into a pit of despair. And rightly so.
^
see you all in 3 days
Well, he liked Raymon Origins
Zero Punctuation owns
cya
And liked Portal & Portal 2
I liked Rayman before it had sequels.
who couldn't like Rayman Origins, that game is awesome
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7T0VU7LzYqM/Tw5RO2Gs6MI/AAAAAAAACWc/IPjpXQ7oSyw/s1600/Capture.PNG
I played Rayman on a PS1. In a cave. With a box of scraps.
lol
that ironman meme
hay
CCCP: I am okay with this
did we watch Ironman here?
the movie? yeah
We did.
TheDerpiest: :)
nice
i think a GOOD RPG needs to be made... and not another FF release... FF13 made me disappoint
A good MLP FIM RPG
I thought FF13 was good
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmUkrR9vDjRUdFl0Z0pReE9TS3VPRkZXeFI4VW9POGc&hl=en_US#gid=0
And then I started playing it
yeah
same
CCCP: support Absolute Balance done by MrEvergreen
otakon: :)
ive been keeping tabs on this one MLP RPG being made... it looks like it will be fun http://azurecrash.blogspot.com/p/info.html
Soon we can have another Lord of the rings marathon :p
>_< no
That weekend was amazing.
But chances are we'll probably hit up some other film sequence.
/me bursts into flames
test
Like The Matrix, or the Alien movies.
boooooo Matrix...
We could watch Terminator 2
Love The Matrix.
Aww I missed Miyazaki Week
TheDerpiest: yes you did, poor soul you are
Meanwhile: the first Matrix was awesome, but if you wanna see all three movies in one... while it still makes sense, watch Dark City... it came out a year before Matrix and was pretty much the same movie
yh
You know what looking at the backlog makes me think of?
what?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8OpsPok6iQ
I think they shoulld show Pom Poko
GAH! STAR TREK ENTERPRISE WAS WORST STAR TREK EVER!
TheDerpiest: put it on your lottery entry
Midnight_Tempest: oh hush, it was fine
We should watch the 1903 movie "The Great Train Robbery"
otakon:What?
Midnight_Tempest: never really watched it, but I like the theme music.
woops
its like 9mins long
WE SHOULD WATCH THE GREAT DICTATOR
We should dig a moat!
otakon: wait does that have Charlie Chaplin in it?
TheDerpiest: the lottery, what we do to determine which movies we watch on BMN, don't you get the newsletter?
CCCP: eeyup and the greatest speech ever made
ever
I will still forever love the captain in Quantum Leap
otakon: the show threw a wrench in the storyline... which opened the way to the new Star Trek movie... the NX-01 was supposed to explode on its maiden voyage
otakon: yes it is
otakon: Do I need to be registered somewhere?
i was going to suggest Schindler's List but i think the chat would explode
TheDerpiest: yh, just pm a mod with your email and they'll sign you up for it
And don't forget that Star Trek Online follows the story according to the last film too
TheDerpiest, bronystate@gmail.com
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ANOHTER great movie!
TheDerpiest: mail bronystate@gmail.com asking to be added to the mailing list, or pm a mod.
Dat break in the sentence.
I'll do that then
The Schindler's list is a deep and touching movie, really
i can see the chat for that one, everyone spaming nazi and other stuff
flutter_spin is correct... though i do like STO, its not a horrible MMO and i hate those kinds of games
Been a while since I played STO.
If it was to be shown, we'd just best hope for maturity amongst the viewers
It's nice to have an mmo that doesn't just require "kill this" as an objective.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: but it's a GREAT movie, put it on your selection! I can't I already filled mine out
same thing
i play it for a couple hours every day... though the sound doesnt work in the game, so i play music while i fly around
We should watch the Good The Bad and the Ugly
maybe for the next week
is that or downfall
Meanwhile: Agreed
Greeting everypony.
Have we watched any Westerns lately?
idea... I DEMAND A CLINT EASTWOOD MARATHON!
hi Everlasting_Joy
Ohai Everlasting_Joy
I played through STO for a month. It combines all the fun stuff from all the series.
hihi! Everlasting_Joy
meanwhile: what is this mmo you're referring to?
0,5Ohai there Everlasting_Joy... feeling joyful today?
The space combat is genius, but the ground combat will have you crying.
But I'm hardly fit to talk about mmo diversity, I've played WoW for like, 5 years.
flutter_spin: its F2P on steam if you wanna play it
eeyup
Howdy CCCP, Jim, RanDT2 and LordCelestia.
"Star Trek Online" just went F2P
I still haven't tried out DC Universe and it's F2P too
Bai guys, have to go to bed, have fun here.
hiya Everlasting_Joy
Just? It's been F2P for like a month.,
LordCelestia I am a little joyous today, but it could be better.
ugh. DC Universe is ... bad
Howdy otakon.
Night Scavender
0,5Ah
Meanwhile: I played back in the Vanilla days xD but i try all kinds of mmo . they all have the same ideah though
night Scavender sleep well
night scav
Night Scavender.
WWIIOL is best MMO
DC Universe was horrible... the opening movie however was awesome
0,5Hey Everlasting_Joy, i forgot to tell you, you look a LOT like someone I know in real life named Ryan.
hello
Hey, y'all realize it's been 1 month since "The Last Roundup"?
LordCelestia + Ryan OTP.
it has?
I played DC Universe for a week. I was done. You only get 20 levels
LordCelestia do you ahve a pic?
i dont keep track of time...
0,5Eenope
and it's STILL not back on iTunes is it?
le sigh.. Ryan is an over used name..
0,5Why, is your name Ryan? o___O
ya
Well, that's still neat I look like someone.
Lord of the Rings Online was quite enjoyable
0,5I meant EJ
im not much of an MMO fan... ive played DCU, STO and WoW... and i only like STO
woops o.o
Yeah, if it wasn't for my bro I probably wouldn't have made it to the end in STO
LordCelestia No, my name is Elliott, but if I look like someone you know, that's really nice.
Especially since we had the best ships in the universe: U.S.S. Bacon & U.S.S. Donut
I had a look at TOR during it's opening weekend, was rather neat. But trying to balance mmo's when you're already commited to one is like painting the celing while riding a bear.
I will play TOR, when my bro is ready and when they tweak the bugs
flutter_spin: my ship is called the U.S.S Ravana right now... and im not very far into the game, maybe level 15... 16... not sure
So did anyone else notice it's been 1 month since Derpy talked?
nope
No.
0,5IKR
Midnight_Tempest: what rank is that. I can't remember.
lieutenant commander
Is the Ravana tactical engineering or science?
/me yawns
Ravana
tactical
0,5tacticular
0,5tacticularly
gah... coughing fit... dieing... bleh
Well when you hit captain I'll fire up the Borealis and we can go shoot Borg together.
0,5tacticularizationalismicsism
I could only do the STF maybe 3 times each... then I was done.
Meanwhile: yes... we will, damn borg encounters are impossilbe at my level
There was nothing more for me
Is it still shift+space to fire all possible weapon bays?
Ahh MMO speak!
Actually you can set it to autoshoot when ready
?
Even better. As if my tactical officer needed more of a reason to fire randomly.
Meanwhile, im not sure... i use space for my phasers and 2, 3 for torpedoes... thats all i remember
hio
really... FIRE AT WILL!!
Hi NovedCheese.
In other words, you will never have to tell your ship to fire your weapons again. You just set it to autofire and it will shoot when there is no cooldown
Yep.
hmm... i think im gonna get some excersice, then play some STO... later all
I have to go to the doctor now, so bye everyone
I really liked the whole shift power to improve systems thing though, that's still there right?
Take care TheDerpiest.
Bye TheFerpiest!
yep.
Derp*
Suddenly in the mood for star trekking.
I am very foalish with my spelling. :c
star trekking across the universe, on the starship enterprise under captain kirk!
But the lockboxes they added to STO & LOTRO (as seen in TF2) are horrrrrrible
Bronyzilla: if you partly type a name and press tab it'll autofill for you.
You know, the ones that you get a crate but have to buy the key with real cash
>_< effing lockboxes... i had 30 before i just started tossing them
This I must try.
Ohmygoditworks.
I only use lockboxes if I feel the need to burn money.
And the whisper-all message when someone gets a ship is horrible too
i think i saw 40 or 50 people get a Galor class ship the first day i played...
i want to try my luck with a box in TF2 but i just know it is not going to be worth it
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/110122.jpg
I opened a box during yesterdays TF2 stream
ok, im out to get some excersice... ill bbl
i have a crat in TF2 i cant open it
I got this new Medi-gun
you need to buy a key from the TF2 store
Laters Midnight_Tempest
"new" medigun?
what new medigun?
Well, it was named strange medithingy or something
quick fix ?
yeah, quick fix
Strange quick fix
Quickfix is such a waste of an item slot.
i want it ... are you looking for something ?
not sure
guys, I need a quick opinion on a drawing in progess, if anyone would be so kind to bother
okay post it
It's really been ages since I played tf2, only started now again with you guys
hey Shizuka you still there?
Post, and be judged.
I'll go cook myself some food
13always am i here
go ahead CountDoofus.
laters jim enjoy your food ~

CountDoofus: what's your name?
That's quality.
my name wut? on dA?
No in the game of life.
real life, then?
It's Connor right?
nah, it's Tim. Connor just sounds way better :p
I'll take that as a compliment then.
Just don't make that drawing too.. y'know.
Like Jhon Connor
Her hind legs are a little on the short side but otherwise looking good.
I think it looks perfect at the moment.
longer hind legs, gotcha. anything else, at all?
cutie marks seems a little small too
Pencil doesn't seem sharp enough.
I s'pose.
SSX demo uhmmmm
O U
Her body is kinda long.
Of course, long pony is long.
needs to be more fat ponies
It could just be the way her hind leg closest to the viewpoint is angled.
snips and the one twist likes are the only ones right ?
>Finally finds MLP/Deus Ex crossover
And the eyes come across as ever so slightly derpy.
>Cancelled
:why:
My Little Pony - Implants are Magic?
Because Deus Ex hasn't been interesting for...well, don't even know how long.
magic is augmented
Deus Ex: Pony Revolution, actually.
MirrorImage: i didnt notice what the conversation was about but saw your post and thought you meant breast implants
i have deus ex, but my laptop can't run it for very long ._.
still game is good
Meanwhile: Neither has Diablo II.
WOO
suddenly, Mythbusterts
MYTHBUSTER
But that's not an excuse.
Sumica: hurrah! thank you
mythbusters? really?
that scared me!
brb
I had my volume way up ^^
trolling around on artoftrolling, SUDDENLY, mythbusters music!
Kammerjunk: what does Diablo II have to do with anything?
1,3the stream has attacked!
indeed take cover!
That there are MLP/Diablo II crossovers anyway.
HOLY SHIT THAT STREAM SCARED THE SHIT OUTTA ME!!!!
Despite being an old game.
Stream has gained sentience.
00,10Wooooah!
-.- daddy longlegs is not actually a spider, it does not have fangs, it does not have venom
/me comes back to mythbusters
13WHOAAA
*squee*
Fe Kammerjunk, because the author no longer cares.
I was frantically looking for the ad on the page!
I'm like "whoa, sound out of nowhere"
Damn lag made me hear "Myth between tests!"
All I got before it lagged out was, "I feel kinda sexy"
hoffa is next to gondor
That daddy long legs. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsXyRVQN70U

Dat mob.
So who's actually streaming?
Rip chords. . . my enemies.
dat little red wagon
Beg you pardon, but walrusses don't normaly wear clothes
Oi
Is this being streamed from space?
00,10What makes you ask that?
The lag.
People in the window does not care for pigs
"In case the sidewalk explodes"
Pig + Concrete = bomb?
1,3hehe
Science!
Decomposing gas.
It's the mythbusters, they make mostly everything explode
And what's wrong with that?
*especially* concrete trucks
Whale corpses have been known to explode because of decomposed insides.
1,3someone's going to be lighting a cigarrette there and blow themselves up
Burning methane gass, fun
I hate it when I forget that I parked my car behind a jet.
00,1025m.....that's almost 8storys
eeyup
god I love Mythbusters
i call bullshit on this one
Dark_Horst: just watch it man
that's a Chrysler? Like hell it is
I love the video where the city government was trying to remove a dead beached whale with dynamite.
that's a poniac if anything
Krakass: That sounds like the worst idea ever
oh i do
1,3lol, trusting aint he
but i still call bullshit on 25 meters
Looks like an intrepid.
Way to date yourself show.
00,10Dodge, chrysler,plyomth. they are all the same.
Idek what you guys're talking about.
car stuff
Jim, it didn't work out too well. The video is on youtube.
I hate car stuff.
1,3Sumica, why do you insist on distracting me
00,10it's what I am not payed to do ^_^
whoa
they're making an rc out of a full-sized car
Why does mythbusters cars always have a failure?
god, i want their job so fucking hard
Jim - because buying a proper failure-proof car would be a waste of money
00,10You get what you payed for Jim
Why must cheap things fail?
b
*honk.
bc that's how it works
00,10and the copcar worked just fine
Someone built that car in a cave with a box of scraps. Damn right you get what you payed for.
piece of SH*T
Yeah, they'd probably not want to destroy expensive cars ^^
Meanwhile: okay, enough with the damn scraps joke
13have to admit
13doing donuts with a remote control cop car
13pretty awesome
indeed Shizuka
I like the one where they crash Adam through the fence.
otakon's router was made in a cave. With a box of scraps.
Krakass: oh yh that one
Meanwhile: shaddup!
1,3let's weld next to carpet!
Sounds like a good idea
lol

Second is: APPLEJACK!

Firecracker is cool, despite the color
Nice :D
YAY

13yes... could damage the plane...
00,10the car might hit the plane, lolwut

13physics
that makes NO SENSE
The jet might become like a black hole. It could suck the car into it.
yeah
The insurance company must think Pinkie's driving
IN BIZARRO LAND
13they apply for the mythbusters too... moron insurance...
Sounds like a legitimate concern.
The could drive on the wrong side of the engine.
okay brb need more COFFEE
*They

Bring me some otakon
no
it's MINE!
Do not like coffee.
^
ALL MINE! ALL THE COFFEE MUHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

13sneak the taxi behind a live plane
Does coffee power your internet?
00,10plan c4 you meen

Bye whatever you call that front part.
There goes the bumper
fender
/me Glares at otakon
well, get bigger engines, no?
Meanwhile: bumper usually
Well it seems that the car was being taken apart o_o
this, ladies and gentlemean, is why insurace companies suck ass
Clearly the answer is to get more engines.
indeed
nice
This needs about 20% more engines
And then it explodes.
Jim: EXACTLY!
and more shirtless guys
that sad momment when the insurance company was kinda right
Not really.
More shirtless guys and more bacon!
mmmm bacon
13not with these engines anyway
the weren't right bc this wouldn't have happened if they used a PROPER Coach Airliner Engine
lol
gesticulate HARDER Adam!
Yeah, wave at them Adam, that'll help
Holy filly flip flops in a fridge.
an actual 747 engine probably would've flipped it
Batman!

well, i don't really love em either but looking at them is pretty harmless, isn't it?
CountDoofus: that did NOT sound right

Brazilian wandering spiders, ooh.
Full paralysis venom.

Agonising death.
Flying scorpions? Well I guess that's it..

I mean, some people can't even watch one without freaking out
13me either .-.
depends on the size i guess
even in a picture
a little one im fine with
08,01the other day, i found this *huge* spider during a concert i was recording
Shizuka: grow a backbone! the Weta freaks you out and it's a cute widdle grasshopper
13don't make me hit you .-.

thats what made me scared
08,01i picked it up and it enweibbified my hands
did someone say "huge spider"?
http://www.camelspiders.net/camel-spider/spider9.jpg
We don't have spiders larger than 1 cm over here, and none are poison.
rofl
OH GOD
camel spiders
Shizuka: you know I wouldn't bug you if I didn't care
Camel spiders, not really spiders.
:D
i've seen those up close before
their a type of scorpion or something like that
Fire...

Still arachnids

FIRE! KILL IT WITH FIRE!
spiders aren't evil
Jimmy Hoffa myth?
or are they
Spiders are so cuuuute.
/me no sound
and neither is the Giant Weta
Stallion_of_War: Eeyup
WHO LIKES SPIDERS?
13having a black bee the size of your thumb fly two inches past your ear at the tender emotional age of seven sort of puts you off bugs forever
not me
I do :3
00,10totaly understand that.
hornets scare me
yeah,try being stung 3 times by a yellowjacket when your 2
bees? naw
Shizuka: ah, that explains it. Bees have NEVER bothered me though, ever. They actually like me.
hornets are more scarier than spiders
BEeeeeeeeeeeeees
13we had a nest in our roof..
*cue Nic Cage.
I wonder if Jimmy Hoffa was a stow-away aboard the TARDIS and got left behind on some alien planet
i kill Carpenter bees
The only time I've been stung is when I bothered them and then only wasps or hornets.
that's probably what happened to him
Probably.
Stallion_of_War: sounds like a good plot for a Dr. Who ep
/me hugs Shizuka "How are you today?"
i had to kill carpenter bee's because they eat our shed
good thing they dont sting
Science!
^
ahh who doesnt love mythbusters
when i was six i once closed my hand without noticing that a wasp flew into it at exact this moment. oh the pain
We had a wasp nest in our brick wall, had to burn them out
noone
08,01Shizuka: a carpenter bee?
All in the name of SCIENCE!
still not scared of bees though
VHAT HAS SHIENCE DONE?!?
or wasps
Meanwhile: http://xkcd.com/54/
a carpenter bee is a bee with no stinger that burrows in wood
holy bee
I bet he's under the other 10 yard line...
only FEMALE carpenter bee's have stinger,and they dont come out of the nest
13i don't know what it was
00,10they are huge so far as bees go.
ofna01: you know too much about bees
Why would you bury a corpse where someone might find it anyway.
Shizuka: http://xkcd.com/54/
eman
i barley know anything
thats the only bee i know anything about
Meanwhile - Who would look under a football stadium for a corpse?
MC knows too many facts about bees.
ya
I mean, besides the Mythbusters
what was so scary about it Shizu?
Shizuka: it was a BEE! Bees don't bother you unless you swing at them
00,10damit Shizuka I was taking a drink as I read that.
ofna01: she was seven
is it poisonus or something?
Stallion_of_War: You say that while they're looking for in a football stadium for a corpse?
we should watch a twilight zone episode sometime
But they're the Mythbusters
They defy logic
that dashie comic was good :'(
yeah,try sitting on a Yellow Jacket when your two
I know the feeling shizu....I crushed alunimum soda cans when I young and the soad ALWAYS attracted bees and now I cant STAND them...
what dash comic?
The new one on eqd im guessing?
yep
Bah! two hours to kill and no cash for food :(
/me hugs SlurryMoon <3
EVER!
lol i still have pencil lead in my leg from a few years back
hiya SlurryMoon what's up?
Not that I could stomach fast food right now
/me huggles emangamer
There was a wasp nest in a metal bin at the local park when I was like, 12. We sprayed it full of deoderant and set it alight.
Lol, I have pencil lead in my foot.
also, MOAR MYTHBUSTERS YAY!
3Hi, I"m just lurking.
13EVER
SlurryMoon: I haven't seen you in a while...where have you been?
Meanwhile: that is cruel man
Cruel but effective.
I saw Kari!
Shizuka: inb4 JFK conspiracy
i acidentally stabbed myslef in the thigh and its still a black mark
SlurryMoon you blew your lurking when you spoke.
!
Besides, playing heads and volleys is hard to do when surrounded by wasps.
whasthat?
this a revisited episode?
Sumica: and THAT line made one of the best quotes ever
He thinks like Pinkie Pie!
Quack.
08,01Shizuka: if it was a bee that was black, and it had a nest in your roof, it was almost certainly a kind of carpenter bee
I suppose I could go borrow headphones...
13that's great
6_9
MirrorImage: its the equivilant of a flashback episode for any other show
00,10s2ep1 myths revisited
but they're so big and fuzzy!
i know emangamer
i was wonder if this *was* a revisited episode
carpenter bee's are about 50 black 50 yellow
bees don't bother me
08,01actually, there is a kind of insect i'm not too fond of: wasps
oh I remember this
I'm inclined to believe Shizuka doesn't care what kind of bee it was as long as it stays far far away.
their tails are black
Wasps however I can't stand
everything else is yellow
Dat fig leaf.
08,01i think they're lovely, and beautiful, but i'm kinda scared of them
WASPS ARE BITCHES
08,01Ingwaz: i *love* bees
they stung me to hell for no reason
08,01i keep bees
them and Hornets
Science, it works bitches
08,01or rather, i used to keep bees
honeybees are boss
00,10Oh hi young tory
08,01otakon: hornets are actually pretty docile
but passing solid urine would be painful
TORY....he looks young
08,01Ingwaz: i used to have a coupl eof hives in my garden
KwakLad: not ACTUAL solid urine... /)_-
tell that to my couple dozen scars i have from wasps

Oh Tory, soon you'd jump a wagon on a bike.
08,01otakon: hornets or yellowjackets?
08,01because yellowjackets are aggressive, but most other wasps and hronets aren't
oh god dont get me started on yellowjacket
emangamer: i know i know, i would accept 'continuous' more than 'solid'
I hit wasps with things.
otakon: you are always on the list of wasps shit
Grant is best built team mythbuster.
apparently emangamer and how are you today?
13things that small that fly that fast are perfectly capable of screwing up your week
wasps aren't that dangerous
HAHAHA
dark
there's always a few stray ones bothering your veranda breankfast
they never sting
they can kill you if a whole swarm gets you
08,01Shizuka: how are you about moths?
shoo them away and everrything's fine
08,01ofna01: true
i love moths and butterflys
13squish
08,01but you'd need to be stung a *lot* of times
08,01:(
One time I was following my brother through the woods and my brother stepped on a yellowjacket nest. The first thing the ENTIRE neest saw at once was me....I got about 110 stings that day
Dem anomalous readings.

08,01it's not native
Pee on an electric rail they said. It'll be fun they said.
lol...
Yeah but realistically have you ever peed in public? You damn sure get as close as possible to the target surface to minimise chances of anyone noticing.
dat...physique..
Is anything ever confirmed?
Nothing like getting a friend to pee on an electric fence.
08,01ofna01: that looks like a rustic sphinx to me
Meanwhile, Jim, PinkiePieCopy: any suggestions for improvement on that drawing at all?
yeah,i found it out
Umm

Love the whole "no commercial" thing :).
Meanwhile: IDK about you but I dont lie down next to an electrifid rail when I pee in putlic

The thing I hate about mythbusters now is the constant recap of the episode.
CountDoofus: Maybe adjusting how the horn is positioned?
http://img.fotocommunity.com/photos/13912461.jpg
That is cruel D=
Scootaloo Gun?
PinkiePieCopy: that's coming later, just making sure Vinyl is as accurate as can get for now

Chicken of Duty Modern Friedfare
CountDoofus: leg improvements are good, eyes still come across kinda derped. Horn needs to be more on the forehead.

Why does Adam have no hair?
He painted himself in gold
OH HEY...we worked with transformers in lab today....
He got painted gold earlier.
transformers are indredible how they work...
His glasses are too short.
He also got a thermometer in the rear.
Autobots go!
they tested a myth that included him getting a latex skin. so he had to shave
oh, not that kind of transformer
Autobots, transform and roll out.
I had to shave my beard today :(
Ping.
My face is all smooth now though.
Enjoy it while it lasts
I did.
The hair was so fluffy
I had grown it for about 2 months
Penetration is the word of the episode.

/me we're watching science and I just learned Wilfred is, still alive (/Portal)
