is there a word for that?

How does it compare to the US? I've never been to Europe, just wondering how it is to someone who's lived both places
Erm... Absent-minded?
drunk minded?
I mean
in a lot of cases I don't know anyone in a particular chat's gender. Nor do I really care to
/me shrugs
Well drugs is legalized here... (for now)
I feel the same way.
XD all drugs?
if I speak to american people that's the first they ask me...
do you live in Amsterdam?
me; no
I really actively associate my persona to each gender
nah just softdrugs of course
Well that's certianly interesting.
I don't really see why people bring gender up into most conversations, unless it is about copulating... but other than that, it shouldnt matter imo
any other notable differences?
especially with such variations on thoughts and opinions.
/me shrugs
just musing
hello HeatWave
Hi.
sorry just went for nomnoms..

I think it does make me feel like people are being largely superficial IRL
well good luck with whatever you decide to do. I imagine it is a tough decision to switch countries.

it would mean, based on evolution, that we are now evolving based on mental traits and not physical traits

I have something for you.
Not switching countries, no. If I had no family I would move to south america.

that can bee good or bad though, we might devolve physically into something... weak> I can't think that straight right now -.-
Why south america?

gender does not stop everyone
I do too, lol, or at least. how well they take care of themselves, their height, etc
Erm... I mean, different factors determine sexiness on the different genders...

I'd find it more of a simeultaneous thing, but eh
/me does not care about anything other than personality. Do not be a weenie and we are cool.
yupers visiting would be nice
well, the first thing I think of is how "jpt" someone looks
jpt?
"hot"
I r bad typer
I see.
Not to mention I'm surrounded by homophobia in a way. "He's gay, he must be an abomination of nature, let's taunt them until they're depressed to the point of suicide!"
I like south america. The people there are very laid back, like me XD
u505 in illinois, hms victory in portsmouth and the old river monitors in paraguay and brazill
the NW US is very liberal about sexuality, which I'm glad for

you get into awesome convos about drinking
I don't drink
Religion and such
drinking is cool, til you want to puke
then you puke and it's cool again
lexington, thats an www2 aircraft carrier isnt it...
if you puke, you drank too much
yep
and you just wasted alcohol
or too fast
or just drank something lame

Tried to bore myself to sleep by reading and copy-editing a couple of fics, but I just can't get tired....this sucks...
Hey everyone!

If you're anywhere near a Borders book store that's still open/in closeout - you could maybe try and find him a book on the history of Jazz, or I know alot of musicians put out autobiographies....or something like that.
That's a good idea I'll have to look into it
…don't you ponies read topics?
Tickets to something?
I'm just curious
Hah I even watch Masterchef Australia at night
He doesn't have the time for shows
Sorta kinda but not really?
read topics
/me #EquestrianStudy

It's good he got to it before some other asshole did
Okay

Similar in the news tonight, RePod still knows too much.

Investigators stumped as to why.
You just can't explain that.

Umm
I like it, but...
I prefer to stay with my tf2 wallpaper though
welp can't do a thing
Why are her parents not there?
well, I don't think it parses identifiers or variables
The parennts are in existence, just not presence
because just reprinting $2 etc. doesn't do that
that's why I'm trying to break out of that limitation
I have my wallpapers randomized on startup :d
Hello EveryPony

Pretty good read, if only cuz it's got a complex story.

They were awesome

With the Zebras and the ministaries and such.

It was known as the emote-route bloodbath.
well, I'm out for the night. I've been up way too long, and drank a bit

The house still stands there, drenched in blood.
Some say it's haunted.
<Balloons> "They'll shower us with Diamonds!"
But one thing is known throughout the world of emotionland....
oDo still lives there.
yep
Can't figure out how magnetism works. Must be magic, and the scientists are just lying to us, even though they've got PHDs they've worked hard for many years to earn! Makes sense!

no it's not pacific

Oh wait actually
Eslecially sinceI'm prone to nosebleeds...
Central
Ugh.
I suppose it could be CEST now I think on it. It's just confusing me because it's an hour ahead of me.
summer time?
Time differs in winter and summer

it is*
Not all of them, chess is probability and stats

Beee right back
hope to get streaming fixed today, a little more patience pls
well, I meant games from the 1900s
Chess is probably one of the few games not reliant on luck
chess, go, etc. don't count
When did this get transformed into a civilised conversation about old-timey games
Randomize
Well, ponies, I gotta fly. Smell yah later.
^RainbowDash: well yeah, but a lot of games take this randomized factor and make it strategic
e.g. dominion
Where is seth's status that everyone is talking about?
Something about Trixie

Oh Greg Benson, you're awesome
Must say
Must resist... Falling asleel...
I rather like that Opera has a built-in IRC client
Orly
did not know that
I shoulda utilised it sooner lol
I really need coffee
Me neither
Yah
And I have Opera installed
Along with 4 other browsers....
If you type in an irc server in the address bar preceded by irc:// it automatically starts the IRC client.
Just snort some sugar, that keeps you awake :P
/me installs opera to check it out
?
Cocaine
Nah
A nosebleed WOULD keep me awake
woah
it does have an irc client!
But I prefer not to resort to that
I'll have to keep this in mind...
And is a resource hogger.
you can try kmeleon as an alternative to ff
And then I installed Opera and it instead uses only 80K to sit there doing nothing.
(i might have to ask you for tips on that later--i could never get sound working)
Argh.
Piece a crap thing...
Go
Opera
AWWWWWW
does it have a bugzilla replacement?
Fuuuuuuuu
Safari too
it is basically a... debugging tool for html/javascript
Oh, yes it does then.
helps determine which scripts are running slowly, not working properly, etc.
It has Dragonfly built in.
eh, but it isn't open source... meh
that's exactly my issue aswell...
but i'll get back to you on it once I have it sorted out
That doesn't really matter unless you're an active developer yourself.
but I am a developer -.-
A program developer or a web developer?
program
Something went wrong after I left?
Well then I suppose it may matter a little to you.
not that I've actually looked FF source code or anything
Oh wait a minute
just an api
/me shrugs
Even if it's not open source as such, it's still free
Oh I am Back.

Literally.
it's "best password"?
Hehe.
Try it.
Applejack
They aren't there when Applejack leaves the farm, when Applebloom isn't even born.
Parents you mean the rich ones?
Huh?
I saw CMC ep last night
Oh
Yeah.
The parents are never shown.
Even before Applebloom is born.
to be fair, only 2 ponies have their parents shown
Twilight and um...
pinkie
Pinkie.
and pinkie
I meant in the mane 6 :P
:(
Hi Ossalaa
haii
It just strikes me as odd that Appleblooms parents are gone before she is born, then go back to the farm, give birth to her, and then leave again!
dont even know the names of any of them
:O
I dun derp'd, I accidentally jabbed the jack into my reset button XD
Appleblooms talent is architecture.
I called it.
But I don't think she is adopted.
Maybe it is a Appleflower?
Eh.
Just as likely.
Heheheh ~
OR BOTH.
sooo....incest?
Ehhhh
Maybe.
>Rednecks
must be
its plausible
Yup.
but never in a kiddies show
Yes.

/me is on irssi
Yeah, guess it's the "normal" layout
Well, you can't define NORMAL, really
my point ^_^
wtf i have never heard this used in britaion
*told you
1. In a state of mind that prevents normal perception, behavior, or social interaction; seriously mentally ill.
2. (of an action or quality) Characterized or caused by madness.
:P
1. (of a person) Of sound mind; not mad or mentally ill: "hard work kept me sane".
2. (of an undertaking or manner) Reasonable; sensible.
Defined.
>prevents normal perception >define normal >ipmlying perception ani't different for erryone
@awesomemeter Prince-Dari's dictionary
6 Prince-Dari's dictionary is 47% awesome. (1400)
And it still applies today Dman.
But normal is a kind of weird mess of averages that applies to no one.
>define madness / mentally ill / of sound mind / sane / reasonable/sensible
Do it
: )
:>
I'll let the OED do that for me. :P
/me is not IC atm. Booooring!

If you wanna climb the building, from experience people call the police and you get arrested for trespass.

They keep saying Baa ba ba ba
You said this earlier : >
Pizzabab
Pizza
depends on what's on 'em
Kebab is horror.
like the part of the intro that goes 'Bara'
Technically you can combine them into a Kebab Pizza.
that's my favorite part
total false advertising

My genuine preference would be pizza.

here is a trailer
Winter-puff 2 LEGENDARY TIER trailers
Eh, I know some people dislike Smith, that's fine, I just don't agree.
=]
Never before have people been as accepting and tolerating :3
According to rules
You can swear
just not like a sailor
yeh
not gonna request nao cuz it's sad, but it's also legendary tier imo :3
Yeah Dman.
MARTHA
Lol Dari
but I like to keep it to a minimum when I'm moderating
MARTHA JONES!
They don't want me spending my own money to get the iPod, but if I write a 1000 word essay on why I can't use my dad's old mp3 player for university, they'll pay for it
MARTHA IS AWESOME
Smith can't act is an acceptable accusition
Marthaaaa
BUT MARTHA IS AWESOME Companion
: /
Something different.
Woman?
But oh well, apple cider sure is delicious
it keeps things in a brighter mood if the use of explicitives is kept on the down-low
LOL
I mean there's no reason they couldn't have one, I mean they'll just have to explain it later.

I hate most of the Android mp3 players
!moon
Grab my tail, The_Crowing!
Lame.
ops can do it however many times they like
because sometimes we need to
Pfft
I hate all of the Apple MP3 players
XD
This video's top comment:
One of them anyway.
And there are other Mp3 players out there
for guests
I agree.
yeah
there are android mp3 players? o.O
aha
Everything isn't Android/Apple ya know :p
no
I guess O.o
Android mp3 player applications
The moon thing can get you banned?
oh
okay.
There aren't any decent ones imo
Winamp on Android plz
5 minutes ON THE MOON!
well it's a phone.
for all the other sentient mods though, it's Warn->Kick->Warn->Ban(24hrs)->Warn->PermaBan
Smith is like on an imbalanced scale and jumps from one side to the other, tilting it heavily each time
he
(MOAR DOCTOR)
Winamp's app sucks Hyper
it has a real good story to it. you should buy it its only 8.00
Baw :P
6Only? o.o
Well WHY a iPod :P
yeah but something went wrong
!moon
Grab my tail, Justanotherpony!
Mostly because my friend's selling one for the cheap
I cringe at Smith's acting. :/
I would recommend the Cowon D2, but it's not produced anymore I don't think.
doesnt give a lot of time to grab on
~45 hours of playback time <3
or at least 40.
I bet the average sansa is cheaper than a iPod on sale :P
Yeah capture not centered, dari
i bought it before prices jumped back up, infact i bought 2 one for me and one for my homie.
Oh wow, nice
Wait doesn't android already play mp3s as it is?
Nice :P
Oh.
oh it's like the witch thing
Or did I not read enough
6:O
yeah, but with even less air
lol
or something.
Yes
even tho its only $8.00?!
Thanks :)
6Yep
This is a really good episode.
yeah but the other way around, if you die you're guilty if not you're innocent
damn that sucks.
It also erases my playlists for no reason
6I wish I had like 500$ just to spend on games.. :P

Ahahah do it!
Well
03um
03well

Was it a specialized mailbox?
03I dunno, I didn't see it
03I was too busy going WOOOOOAH
Well yeah but if you're replacing it
03well
I figure he would have explained it
03I'll have to talk to him
03no
03to care
Ok, stream's up.

I can't believe he cared more about his mailbox
03I offered to give him my insurance info
streamception
03well to be fair Luna
13LOL sorry, I shouldn't laugh
In which case it could be specialized
season 1?
13and why he bought such an expensive one, I've no idea
03you'd be like WTF are you smoking
yep
13I'm sure it does the same job as a much cheaper one
03but he didn't even want me to explain, he was just like pay me
03I know right
Angel, landscaping probably

03just the lines showing solid/liquid/gas/supercritical fluid
03no
03just the axes saying Pressure and Temperature

9GLORIOUS QUALITY
4LAWL
9of course I do
9I'm OCD for this sort of things
9NEW OCD
9that said
7Could I use the smaller font?
GLOOOOOOOOOOOOORIOUS STREAMING!
03sure
7I mean, it still fits.
9this truly is the optimal quality, I believe.
Dat explosion
9the only thing is
9subs of smaller font?
9white instead of yellow?
9ect.
meh, dubs never bother me
dat static
*request
9sorry
9OMW
OMW?
On My Way
ok
03Yes
7Can I abbreviate?
7Because writing 'pressure' and 'temperature' takes up half of the width.
7Unless I squeeze the spacing.
9there we go
offline
7Specifically, the solid-to-liquid line is at a different angle.
Syphillis?
as in...the disease
oH NVM
03sure
03just do temp. and however you can think of to abbreviate pressure
03though for the pressure side
03you can do it vertically if you know how to.
7I know.
Henry VIII?
dammit val...
Ryu Hayabusa?
7So the direction of that slant...
7Should it be left or right?
BUT BE SAD FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY CANNOT LIVE HER

03it's vertical with a slight slant

well, just keep that into consideration :P
03let's see
9guys I'm thinking
9IN SPAAAAAAAAAAACE
9Guys
9I'm going to
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
9test something DEEPER
WUT
9something....
BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW
9REVOLUTIONARY
/me needs the inception button link >.<
9for users with lower bandwidth
03hm that failed
7How many shades?
7One?
03um
03no
03eith with different shades
7Huh.
03hold on
Is the stream up? Not loading for me.
Hi, Dari
Hey.
I'm having the same problem
9someone check it out
9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
9later on I'm gonna blow this one up in size to match the size of this window
9but yeah
dat face
should we check even if we have fast connections?
9both streams should be up
9the link I just sent
9is the Low Quality stream
9as in you only need .2 Mbps
Quality looks exactly the same on both to me?
Maybe it's because it's not moving.
03that is really bizarre
9exactly because of that
9and....playing.
yeah, it's hard to tell
03http://i.imgur.com/cSwgP.jpg
7Okay. o.o
9also consider the low quality stream is a smaller window
7Hmm.
9can you
9go fullscreen with both?
I see it's lower quality now.
9and tell me how they look
I've got both open.
well it's definitely a noticeable quality change
7Can you adjust the black/white threshold?
fluidity wise, it looks the same
Both work full screen.
though is the HQ one meant to be slightly behind?
9probably it takes time to encode
9but yeah
9this is great
9it equates to higher quality in the main stream
Yeah, with higher quality one is further behind.
well done
I suppose I could add a button to the site to switch between high/low quality stream.
9how's the audio quality on the HQ one?
Audio's fine on both.
eh, the static is noticeable
But yeah, static.
other than that it's fine
HUGE static,but fine.
9how about now?
still thar
it's softer now
The static's only on the HQ one I think?
Less audible,but still there.
/me thinks he's actually behind on the stream
9I MIGHT have to switch to VAC
out of curiosity, are you purposefully pausing it?
because I'm getting sudden pauses occasionally
9in some places, yeah
9but not now
hmmm
9guys
9I wish to ask you something
9current audio quality in the main stream is
9 128 kbps
9I could lower that to 96
9would you like that?
The HQ was fine for a while alongside the low quality one with me, but yeah, it now freezes every 4-5 seconds.
9or do you prefer higher-quality audio?
hmmm
03Not sure.'
probably, Polarfire
9probably due to the stress in my net...cause I opened to watch the LQ one
but if lowering audio fixes the freezing, go with that
Whats this?
I would like to change my nickserv password but nickserv keeps running me in circles
stream is down for me
ok
9lowered audio quality on both
/me ponders yet again about it
9*experiences
Static on HQ one, I closed the low quality one.
okay, as far as the HQ goes (accidentally closed the low one)
9roger that, then
.......GODDAMNIT GUYS HELP ME!
did you pause it?
9I'll be fixing audio soon
It still freezes for me but a lot less common.
because the freezing is starting up again
9no, I didn't pause it
its buffering for me
then yeah, the freezing seems to be unrelated to audio quality
WHY DOES EVERYPONY IGNORE ME?!
Only if you use a version that is 7+ years old
03OK,. uploading.
gah I dont know whats going
9video reverted on the HQ one
9streaming both at the same time
9testing for fluidity
Necessitating a very annoying reboot.
9how is the HQ one right now?
no freezing- YET
oh
there it is
9gonna close the LQ stream
and now it's....gone?
9watch for a minute, and then tell me
lol on a random note
this episode was totally inspired by ME2
9any freezing thus far?
9going to restart the LQ stream
9re-streaming the LQ stream as well
9Ziltoid
9test the Low-Quality stream
9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality

oh ok

That sucks
looks good to me

9going offline
9restarting both
kk
1. Reboot a MicroVAX 3900 running VMS 7.3.
2. Reboot a VAX 11/780 running an Ultrix variant (can't remember the version).
3. Reboot a PDP-11/70 running RSTS/E 10.1.
4. Reboot a quad processor PDP-11/74 running RSX-11/M+.
9both should be live now
5. Reboot a KS-10 running TOPS-10.
6. Reboot a KL-10 running TOPS-20.
And finally: 7. Reboot a PDP-15/XVM running XVM/RSX.
9Ziltoid

my parents married when I was two, divorced when I was five
As its possible that there are different procedures
My parents were married in 2001 but they were together a long time before
But I believe that the consenting one would call a court day, both would appear in court
