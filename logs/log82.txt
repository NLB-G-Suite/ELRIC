And so, Twilight's library was full of fanfic
the mayor has a wife?
hey
well that makes him getting seduced by sedusa even more awkward
This is better than a muffin with frosting.
lol ya think barry XD
that's why I posted the 3:40
/me calms down from rage mode as he reads on and finds out that the Spartans are on Fluttershy's side
Muffin with frosting? Blech
lol, powerpuff signal against a perfectly clear sky
I thought muffins turn into cupcakes when you apply frosting.
Woooaaaahhhh.....
Wait until derpy finds out.
Muffins are made from different stuff.
That's the first time I actually hear some sort of definition between cupcakes and muffins
Cupcakes are made from cake.
…lolwut?
and cups
and muffins are made from?
Muffins are made from, umm... Not cake
muffins are more....breadlike...
Sugar and spice and everything nic--
/me pictures cup shaped cakes
I would say, like a sweet bread.
Err, snips and snails and puppy dog tai--
No mook, cupcakes are cakes IN cups
err
Welp
ikr
and would taste awful with frosting
There's only one word for cupcakes and muffins I know in Finnish
Which is muffinssi
Seems like dictionary says cupcakes are vuokaleivos, but I've never heard anyone say that

/me Beatline will never go to space.
I always liked catdog.
Colgate, remember: the fact core is always incorrect except what he said about Paul!
One my my favorites :)
NOBODY'S GOING TO SPACE MATE!
(didn't play portal 2)
Technically 89% of magic tricks are not magic, they are sorcery
The adjectives were correct
about him being handome
I got everyone a free vacation to space!
But the nouns were not
No Paul, you said that
Colgate needs to play Portal 2
also, an ostriches eye is bigger than it's brain.
/me thinks portal 2 is too expensive atm
/me goes to space because it's a terrible meme
/me doesn't get it.
I got it during the summer sale for $30...
I preordered it for $45
/me is wondering why he always reading "portal 2" as "postal 2"...
and got a free copy of Portal 1
/me thinks 30$ is still too expensive for what it is
/me thinks Colgate is wrong on so many levels.
mook: that's not too bad. I once was discussing it and a couple of girls thought it was Porno 2
there is a chance that Colgate may have a very minor case...of brain damage.
well, I *do* have a relationship with Berry Punch
Fact: Portal 2 is amazing and should be played by everyone.
Shortish, yes. Full of epic win, clever dialogue, and brilliant level design? Also yes.
I didn't play a whole lot of P2
Well, except Wheatley's first homemade chamber.
Celestia: I booked everyone a free vacation to the moon!
Free DLC: yes
But annnyyywwwaaaayyyy
OH GOD NO!
Everyone : Yay Luna :Ugh
Just that back in June, during my visit to my friend in Malmö, we were at his buddy's place, playing the co-op
/me shakes his head
Paintsplash: a very minor case of SERIOUS brain damage
ugh, lag
Thank yo.
You.
Then he had to go do something, so I played the co-op myself
np, that's (one reason) why I'm here
Holding two controllers and all
You see that? Right there? I was quoting God.
Un thus Celestia had everyone go on vacation on the moon just to spite luna
OMC!

All functionally indistinguishable from the originals.
No memory of the incident.

nobody knows what their screaming about
But they were killed by a raging race of whhite creatures thanks to a red flower created from a source of unbelievable evil magic
Absolutely terrifying.

Yakety sax is the only, true theme for such a scene
/me epicsaxes. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrdwhXNt4qw
Gourmet Race isn't quite as silly
Someone needs to speed up the Epic Sax video and replace the music with this.

where Spike's playing a saxophone

Colgate is awesome
/me shoots away all containers of alquihol from Colgate
at the moment it seems I'm only connected to two, heh. I actually kinda don't get the connections sometimes

Why are you protecting me from Berry Punch's lifestyle? It is one filed with joy and carelessness!

Because drinking is bad, mmmkay?
Mmmmkay kids
lol, Colgate
But she protects her kids so well

How's things in europe?

ah. What time is it over there? I know UK is 6 hours ahead of me but not sure about the mainland.

I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about MLP - Sweet Apple Acres TV Commercial
Surprisingly well made
that was a weird vid
/me gets all her apples from SAA anyways.

So I just have to remember you are 1 hour ahead of the UK.
I got it : D
Off to game I shall, so be a dear and be a pal!

I just hate timezones
Zis one
eeyup.
Was hoping to stream now but gonna need some more help with setting stuff up

Ahh
hopefuly I get stuff sorted out tonight with Sprinkles
advanced mario sequencer?
I wish you good luck
*shrug* never heard of it, but it seems to still be mario paint
plus it was a pretty good theme
hmm I wish it was cloudy here.
/me has a headache
I mean its dark right now but....
/me thinks another shot will solve the problem
/me knows he is wrong, but does it anyways
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qmlWm-3tl0&feature=related
A shot of water, yes. xP
During the day its very hot, my area is in a terrible drought right now.
o no, it would take much more than a shot of water for how much I've drank tonight
Sorry to hear that ever been to europe?
I have not. Wish I could go though.
A few gallons?
IIRC you have lived in the US before right?
/me listens to Moldova song contest (where epic sax guy came from)
not that much water, but a lot!
*shrug*
/me is reconsidering RPing ponies
Just drink some water at some point, it'll feel better
Ill think about it tomorrow when Im sober :D
I was born there
you have successfully fulfilled your 'why is it when you are drunk it is all you can think about' quota.
but kinda traveled all around the globe with my parents at young age
hey, no stealing my quotes!
Ah.
I see.
lol
/me still blames Berry Punch for getting him drunk
xD
that is why i quoted it
Him?
So do you have a good memory of the US?
her, it, whatever!
I was thinking to return there at some point
still got a double nationality
it's hard RPing a female char as a male :(
Colgate is transgender. Haa.
your probably just thinking too hard about it
/me rumormills!
really fillies and colts aren't that different - in my experience anyway
I'm thinking too hard? while drunk? probably not
lol, true
I think I'm doing a lot of... not thinking?
Oh that's cool. What counrty are you in right now?
is there a word for that?
netherlands
How does it compare to the US? I've never been to Europe, just wondering how it is to someone who's lived both places
Erm... Absent-minded?
drunk minded?
wow netherlands..thats why its so great chating on irc, you meet folks from everywhere :)
/me RPs four female characters as a male, btw. Though admittedly not drunk...
ohey again Stripes
I've RPed female chars in tabletop games before, but not on teh internetz
it just feels.... so different
Stripes is an Aussie, I'm jealous
internet vs IRL
I mean
You know, I was talking about this earlier to some friends. I wonder if growing up doing a lot of text-only based chatting if it sets your mindset to be more gender nuetral
Hey stripes what time is it over there?
in a lot of cases I don't know anyone in a particular chat's gender. Nor do I really care to
hello stripes
/me shrugs
Well drugs is legalized here... (for now)
I feel the same way.
XD all drugs?
that is true, I don't generally care about a person's gender, just their ideals and what their opinions are
do you live in Amsterdam?
I defniitely grew up on the internet too...
me; no
I really actively associate my persona to each gender
indeed. Especially text only based chatting it seems you learn to concern yourself with thoughts, personality and opinion, gender aside. Way aside.
nah just softdrugs of course
ah.
Well that's certianly interesting.
I don't really see why people bring gender up into most conversations, unless it is about copulating... but other than that, it shouldnt matter imo
I'm curious on wether more internet influence in our lives (this generation - assuming we are all relatively close-ish in age) contributes to our open mindedness about people and their lifestyles. Getting to know people first on other levels
I agree Colgate
any other notable differences?
especially with such variations on thoughts and opinions.
/me shrugs
just musing
hello HeatWave
Hi.
sorry just went for nomnoms..
Well as O said i'm considering moving back to the USA at some point
it is 625pm
I hate timezones don't you stripes?
additionally, I think I will now go retrieve a drink. 'prolly sweat tea with sweat tea vodka
it shall be fun
whee, you can join me!
indeed!
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Fallout Equestria: Project Horizons (Update Part 11) (http://tinyurl.com/44feyrk)
sweat tea?
sounds hideous.
/me must agree
Sathi how long have you lived in the netherlands?
oh gosh, sweet tea
that was a terrible, terrible typo
lol
I've kinda actually drifted from knowing people at all because on tge internet I can learn people without physical constrictions, though the failure of others to do it IRL really makes it hard for it to be an actually pleasurable experience.
[/late]
Is that a good thing?
hmm when I was 12 my parents decided to buy a house in the netherlands. My dad quit his job for AT&T and started his own IT services company and I needed
and i'm making huge spelling errors
too early
:D
lol
dpends I suppose
/me goes into high philosophical drunk mode
Tl;dr: I see most people as dickwads because of that.
/me laughs ^
*shrug*
hmm
Good MORNING Equestria!
I think it does make me feel like people are being largely superficial IRL
well good luck with whatever you decide to do. I imagine it is a tough decision to switch countries.
Good morning Fireant.
People are too damn shallow.
^
it would mean, based on evolution, that we are now evolving based on mental traits and not physical traits
but I suppose that's what gets you to know them
Morning robbin wi... i mean fireant.
'morning Fireant
for better or for worse
Good morning, Fireant.
I kinda like that Graphite
Well it will happen at some point.. Just not sure yet when
'morning, Fireant
>>I kinda like that Colgate
Did you ever think about relocating?
Actually, I suspect that this online interraction, stripped of physical preconditions, makes those preconditions all the more obvious in real life.
timezones, yes.
also internet lag lol
Octavia, sweetie.
I have something for you.
I suppose it can. I think it can work the opposite way too though, help you see beyond them even if they are obvious
Oh? What is it, dear?
http://tinyurl.com/3dq6dfy
that can bee good or bad though, we might devolve physically into something... weak> I can't think that straight right now -.-
you can literally work until you are 30, retire, and live there the rest of your life.
nice Fireant
A car?
My own car? Awesome!
geez i'm soon too old then
How generous
your money automatically triples or something like that.
octavuia card woot
woah, 2 typos in 3 word, ims on a roll!
geez i would have retired years ago then lol
lol
b/c most countries down there are poorer countries, so your money goes a lot farther
!roll 1derp6
Octavia Car is sadly not that good :(
You guys are just a bunch of letters to me. I don't care if you're male or female, fifteen or fifty, all that matters is your ability to communicate. But in real life, the first thing I see is someone's gender. Based on their appearance, I'll have an idea of their personality.
that is unfortunate.
BUT still, its *sunglasses* A Ride In Octavia.
!roll d6
but I could never leave my family.
FallSilently: sorry if I'm failing you right now with this drunkeness :(
Octavia: you rolled 1
/me is definitely derp'd, then.
never ever?
interestingly enough, gender is like.. maybe the 4th thing I notice, but that, I'm sure is just me
Don't worry. Drunk philosophers are on my level :)
I notice them, but don't use them as judging factors.
If you have a pony name, i imagine you as that pony 6_9
probably not. And by leave I mean move to a different country.
"sexiness factor: is the first thing I notice, then gender, then personality, usually at least
Wait
when talking to people irl
You notice sexiness before gender? 9.6
/me is bi
gender does not stop everyone
I do too, lol, or at least. how well they take care of themselves, their height, etc
Erm... I mean, different factors determine sexiness on the different genders...
/me wants to go out drinking with GraphiteLuck one day.
/me would welcome that with open hooves
I see what you mean
I'd find it more of a simeultaneous thing, but eh
I would love to travel and see other countries though
It's actually interesting. In my line of work I card people; a lot. I actually find I look at eyes first. Every time. They really are windows to the soul
/me does not care about anything other than personality. Do not be a weenie and we are cool.
yupers visiting would be nice
well, the first thing I think of is how "jpt" someone looks
they really, really tell you how old someone is. How much they have been through. How tired or bright they are
jpt?
er... jpt... lolz
"hot"
i love old ships, so i want to visit all the museums with old ships in them
I r bad typer
I see.
Not to mention I'm surrounded by homophobia in a way. "He's gay, he must be an abomination of nature, let's taunt them until they're depressed to the point of suicide!"
then you would love holland ;)
I'll keep silent on my take in this matter.
How mysterious.
Stripes we have an old navy battleship near my area. They have it open for tours and such.
u505 in illinois, hms victory in portsmouth and the old river monitors in paraguay and brazill
the NW US is very liberal about sexuality, which I'm glad for
Hai gaise
where is you Polarfire
It's happened, though luckily I steer clear of the cliques who are THAT intolerant.
?
it does indeed take me a while to consider gender though. I generally notice their style of clothing, their gait, any opening gestures, their body type
Hello 9663

>>
taht pic is cutastic
…lolwut?
I'm generally pansexual, but again my tendency towards looking at most of the people around me as dickwads renders me kind of avoidant of relationships beyond friends.
Anyway
omg derpy <3
Well I think I might go soon. Time zones are stupid.
D'awww.
I'm about as gender nuetral bisexual as you get. Which is why I probably look at a lot of other things first
getting sleepy hmm?
I saw that on the art roundup. Very cute indeed.

That

Is cute
I need someone other than myself to try
by the way. If anyone is ever looking at the vodka shelf and is wondering how Absolut Wild tea vodka tastes:
yeah, I'm that way too. I never look at gender first
and we've got 3:40 10:40, and 6:40.
But I remember seeing that on Drawfriend Stuff
it overpowers -anything- you try to mix with it to taste like tea

Timezones are just stoopid.

so really, the only way to mix it is with lemonaide or tea as far as I can tell
thats the oldest usa battleship in existance i think
/me doesn't drink, but thanks
^
but... drinking is fun!
we've got the USS Lexington, that's the one I was telling you about.
you get into awesome convos about drinking
I don't drink
and stuff like that!
Religion and such
drinking is cool, til you want to puke
then you puke and it's cool again
lexington, thats an www2 aircraft carrier isnt it...
if you puke, you drank too much
yep
and you just wasted alcohol
or too fast
or just drank something lame
(hasnt puked from alcohol in years)
By not drinking, I get into depressingly repetitive conversations about me not drinking.
They couldn't sink it. Tried and hit like 4 different times and it would never go down.
eh, I don't judge
04o-o
/me slaps Dragoran
it would come back, get fixed, then go back out again.
it's not for some people. For whatever reason they have; it's usually a good one

02Half their links don't work
Thanks
02Oh god what a mess
sharing is caring
fim!
lol
how bad is luna game 0?
Oh my, hexadecimal abacus.
duh
well, I look at hex all the time, so I t wouldn't be that weird to me, -.-
indeed it is
hexadecimal abacus, my head went asplode
Australia must be beautiful!
I mean i've seen it on tv
people wake up early in the morning for a fresh dive into the ocean
before they get to work
sounds awesome
Not saying weird, more saying neat.
i thought my nixie clock was neat, but hexidecimal sounds more clever.
02YES
02I can totally use the sprite I love
Everyday I'm shuffling.
And my shuffling summoned Sakura.
5:20 AM...can't sleep...
Hellew
The only solution for that is to stare at a packlit digital screen!
backlit*
...eyup...
Colgate: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvsnftXXKdw
Heh, they used it for weights and measures, but still.
I just watched that -.-
02But why can I still not use 5th gen? asdfh;kj'agh'lakjfda
:P
That would explain why I don't believe I've ever met Sakura before...
Tried to bore myself to sleep by reading and copy-editing a couple of fics, but I just can't get tired....this sucks...
Hey everyone!
I want to own an abacus now.
Really really badly.
Hellow Nuke
04why
04are you
04still up Shiny
well i live in the country, about 200km from the sea
Bye, Sakura
Hello Sakura
but still nice
Gah....freaking Chrome.
02I've been sleeping for 3 days, I'm not really that tired
plenty of ponies around :)
Close one tab...end up getting three or four.

I'm just killing some times

I can imagine
Seven chapters of one fic done, four of a second...why is my brain not letting me collapse in exaustion?

I hope someday I can visit Australia
Damnit
12i mean Dragoran
lolwut?
12time to come up with a new reason why this isn't working for me
>.>
Oh god what.
That works....
12-.-
._.
thats always a good goal :) bathurst is a nice place, about 30,000 people live here
Ugh I can't think of what to get my pops for his birthday
do what
03................._..................
see:five lines back.
Okay six.
Or seven.
Well, what does he like or enjoy?
Mostly people seem to be obsessing over abaci at the moment.
He loves jazz singers but I want to do something different other than a music album
/me is working on making his comp make an alarm every 4 hours
My resources are somewhat limited at the moment too, so I don't have much room to work with
Sniff
Y U SO CUT OFF SENTENCE
this is not sopranos
02Why can't I use 5th gen Pokemon? *sobs*
It's candleja
Sniff
Do I smell new members?
Eh
Hmm?
What?
new members? where?!?!?
/me looks around
I'll be over here.
What is this sorcery
Nuclear: no /me
?
Exploit
just /join #BucketOfHolding
Well yeah, looked like it
I did
We don't have voice in there anyway
Thanks for help
…and it sent an action message?
weird…
yep :(
If you're anywhere near a Borders book store that's still open/in closeout - you could maybe try and find him a book on the history of Jazz, or I know alot of musicians put out autobiographies....or something like that.
What do you do for living?
That's a good idea I'll have to look into it
…don't you ponies read topics?
Tickets to something?
I'm just curious
Is Sakura a new member or some sort?
Hah I even watch Masterchef Australia at night
He doesn't have the time for shows
Hasn't seen him/her in this chat before
Sorta kinda but not really?
read topics
/me #EquestrianStudy
when you join a channel, and when it changes
Can anyone explain what happened
It's good he got to it before some other asshole did
What happened where?
I usually lurk, copyedit fics, and generally keep to myself most of the time. Just, too bloody wired right now to sleep - so here I am.
Okay
So
I am in the same boat Sakura
Eh
Jazz such now?
Investigators stumped as to why.
So exhausted right now at 5:33 am
You just can't explain that.
etc.
lol
topics are overrated!
lmfao
OMFG IM EST TOO!
I really need to speak to Graphite about those apostrophes.

It's not bad at all Insidious, though recently I've been cutting my teeth and getting my RPG fix from FF7 again.
Cause it's like a llama.
Can you do it
Everyone hates java, cause it's like an alligator.
Been working my way backwards through the series.
I could.
Call me Lars
Prove it
Righto.
Hi Lars
Wonderful!
Hi Ludovician. Hi Lars.
Hai
Was not I, said the cat.
Hi!
...aaaand, I have officially lost braincells and the ability to laugh at this flash animation. *sighs* Cest la vie.
Did I just get killed
yes
Hiya Lars
Possibly.
which one lol
See.
It involves Celestia, bananas, and the moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Here we go....
oh saw that one earlier
/me roll.
I despise that animation so much.
losing braincells from that is entirely plausible
I thought it was pretty funny
Oh
Funny the first time....each successive time afterward, "Why haven't I closed this yet?"
12well Dragoran
ya
FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC BITCH" ?
It's funny but it's constantly being referenced.
what about you Sathi ?
even the first one they dragged out too long
"Maybe it'll get better....maybe it'll.....get.....okay, where's the vodka?"
yea that one lars
03bye
At least it isn't getting referenced as much as cupcakes
seeya >:
12i discovered something
It may yet.
All ya have to do is take a dash of rainbow, put it in the mix...
cupcakes, so sweet and tasty...
/me hates early days lol
:|
Hopefully not, all the talk I see about cupcakes really gets annoying
That made me think of a really funny mash-up I saw on youtube a while back.
Sniff
I havent actually read cupcakes but heard all kinda of bad stuff about it
Have you seen the darth vader pinkie pie mashup?
It's an over rated gore fic
Darth Vader
LOL
Not really worth your time
Holy shit sneas
The Darth Vader thing is an overrated gore fic!?
It's not even 6 yet
I think twinkle was talking about cupcakes
Where do you work
I've seen the Darth Vader thing. Creepily hilarious.
No silly, it is Darth Vader & Pinkie Pie shipping. I think..?
12is Dragoran interested in what i discovered?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRYE9mVcNh0
/me loads up Youtube and grins, "Whoever thought to put this together was brilliant...and I hate rap..."
no it's this
is it a bot exploit
ah k
wait what?
Oh.
vader
and pinkie?
o-o?
*poker face*

Wow.....this is.....

That, was pretty well done.
I agree
So for legal reasons it's unlikely.

I just uploaded some wallpaper on Ponibooru... http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/43449

went to a channel with +n
Something just struck me as pretty odd.

/me likes the wallpaper
Ah
like
LIKE
Ace, go to that url? :p
Umm
I like it, but...
what, flatter?
I prefer to stay with my tf2 wallpaper though
When we see little filly Applejack going from the farm to Manehattan, we see no parents and no applebloom, becase she isn't born yet.
welp can't do a thing
Why are her parents not there?
Expect cupcakes in the future for better or for worse
if I could embed the character inline sure
Just have them cycle Lawdee
Why not place your wallpapers on rotation?
hi pyroh
That's funny, I saw that wallpaper like 3 times already
Heyo Pyroh
well, I don't think it parses identifiers or variables
The parennts are in existence, just not presence
OHAI PYROH!
because just reprinting $2 etc. doesn't do that
that's why I'm trying to break out of that limitation
I have my wallpapers randomized on startup :d
Hello EveryPony
Sorry i cant stay long
the only reason why you could exploit ESG's script was because of /scid

With loads of videos and stuff
They catch on rather quickly
and then there were ponies in tf2 videos
But its still annoyign
and they they were like WTF IS DIS
TF2 is basically a hat collecting game now
OLD tf2 was good, new tf2 sucks
And then "I have to deffeat the brony"
But at least in cloudsdale there is only bronies and mic spamming mlp
Awesomeness

and then he was the brony

oooh
what are they from?
what fanfic is that from?
yeah that.
Calamity and Velvet Remedy. From Fallout: Equestria.
cool
Eyup
uploading sooooo slow.
okay go!
I've been meaning to read that
m suprised there isnt a youtube channel caleld velvetremedy
called*
but it looks SO long
Vexed
Its worth it
?
Trust me
Pretty good read, if only cuz it's got a complex story.
That's what she said
Like...
I just want more of those animated comics
They were awesome
It's got so much lore and backstory to it.
is it already finished? or Is the author still writing?
Ya, poor lil pip
With the Zebras and the ministaries and such.
Always getting shot at or crushed or beaten
Or something
While velevet just kinda hangs in the backround
And yes. The main characters getting hurt is like daily routine. The author stays true to Fallout. XD
Eyup
Its like 70% of the conflict
If I've never played fallout, would I miss out on much?
No
Not really

/me tells the world that I'mma firin' mah lazah
Its in lik chapter 6
or something
what would be a real spoiler is what HAPPENS to derpy
Yes. I'd say Fallout Equestria is my favorite fanfic.
At first, I was pretty skeptical. Almost stopped reading it after about the first few chapters. I'm glad I didn't .
I'm looking for fanfic recomendations. Are there any other good ones?
Like the first two or three.

Hm. I liked the first Silent Ponyville.

no thanlies
Had a really great ending. Multiple endings, in fact.

The second one is slowly growing on me.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYdJT_KY5_s
Ohh
sweet dreams I wish you then
Past Sins is... love or hate. It seems a lot of bronies don't like it. I can sort of understand why I suppose. It's a pretty sensitive topic among the fanbase right now.
Everyone seems all too eager to argue over it.
:|
I'M BACK
Haven't read it but i can easily see it's one of the most talked about fics here.
if you don't like OC's or drama you won't like it
I'M FRONT
Did you forget about me?
You did didn't you
fffff
Who are you again?
good morning and seeya, cause it's time for me to head to work.
Is this a legitimate Fox News story? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THlvkIEFMqQ
later FreezeFrame
in and out hmm?
I'm in the middle of Past Sins
Not really sure what could be controversal about it.
siff
Hm
Personally, I think some people are just jealous.
jealous of what? Of who?
Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
That their OC stories aren't as popular as Past Sins.
hmm
ooh
Let's see where I am now
That and critics might be bronies, but they're still critics.
okies well night night everypony

Celestia Time
Cos I know it's not Central European Summer Time
Rainbowdash You should probably do something about them clouds then
Sketchy_Sounds: it says in the message
RD, snort some sugar :P
CEST
What place is the server of this site hosted in anyway
Ick.
Pacific Time
that's Central European Summer Time.
Ahh Pacific. OK.
I'm not ever going to snort anything
no it's not pacific
see above :)
Bill Clinton was not only a president and a war hero, but also a Pimp, and a Brony!
Oh wait actually
Owloysius is on Sentral time.
Eslecially sinceI'm prone to nosebleeds...
Central
Ugh.
I suppose it could be CEST now I think on it. It's just confusing me because it's an hour ahead of me.
summer time?
Time differs in winter and summer
whaaat
Well, I should at least eat something
we've been time traveling all along
Just finished playing Luna Game 0
Not bad

"Not bad"? Blah

Oh so it IS Europe time
Hi MrPoniator
Hello
/me looks at Lawdee. {What is it with everypony offering me cupcakes?!}
Hmm. Missed her by half an hour.
:3
Balloons
why did I even included the time zone in the message if you people don't read it :P
Avoid it. xP
Why?
Why is it set to Europe time when the Blog is on Pacific?
Lolz, I'm just used to the time zone always being behind mine.
It's just a pop-scare
I wonder when the show will be dubbed to Dutch
it has to happen
inevitable
Gilda: no specific reason, except that it's the time zone derpy runs in.
Well that does explain it a bit.
Derpy is european
DISCOVERY
^RainbowDash: oh, well then thanks for the warning :)
I wonder what nationality she is.
*Reminiscence*
err
She's from Antderp.
Equestrian...?
equestrian.
=p
but equestria is like
their earth
right
Equestria's in South Africa
You're welcome. It's not really spectacular or anything
she's only staying in Germany at the moment
I thought Equestria was in France
hon hon hon
Shaico!
Shai dun derpd
but she didn't pick up a new nationality because of it
?!
/me slams Shaico against the wall
Explain "waifu!" What have you been telling these ponies?
?!?!
/me slams Gilda against the floor, reaching to her nethers with lewd face!
oh what the hay
Should I even be here
/me sleeps along the grasslands of Ponyville only to be awakened by the bizarre trembling that jolted the landscape......
/me wonders if anyone has considered an uprising to take down the godmod Fireant
/me inserts "?!?!?!" here
"Now we will have fun!"
Huh?
this is PG? :O
OH boy charades
/me take out monopoly and set the board to the game.
I like this game
Lawdee, this chat is usually more after dark than EAD at this time
monopoly? lame
I'm the boot!
Especially when Fireant joins in
;p;
picka good board game at least!
lol
/me wants the car!
Nobody's talked in EAD for 15 mins
killerrabbit, how about Agricola?
Or Twilight Struggle?
because it's like night in the Amrica's?
there we go, now that's a good one :D
I want the car! The car is fast!
I want the nuke!
Gimme
what are we playing?
Agricola!
?
I haven't played twilight struggle, wish I had
We're playing agricola?
Explain
/me drops Nuclear in the lake
Its an awesome game.
rules?
so I've heard
I hog the clay to upgrade my house fast.
-_-
its ok, I get all the wood so you can't build fences :P
end clopmode, initiate workmode
ohai guys
Fences?
lol
Who uses fences!
Settler of Coltan, lol.
ohai
Blargh.
Massive steel walls
hates Settlers of Lucktan.
hai
Not balls
walls
^^
settlers is a bad game -.-
777
666
better than monopoly, granter, but bad -.-
granted*
Monopoly is just for raging
ffffuuuuuuu
And Sorry is for trolling
Monopoly LOL
monopoly is, roll the dice, go afk for a minute while everypony else does their turn -.-
^
since the game is 95% luck
True
So true
I never liked monopoly
Get out of jail free.......
all the "classic" board games are luck based, it kind of sad really :/
it is*
Not all of them, chess is probability and stats
^
strats*
Beee right back
hope to get streaming fixed today, a little more patience pls
well, I meant games from the 1900s
You could get lucky and get matched against someone useless.
Chess is probably one of the few games not reliant on luck
chess, go, etc. don't count
I'm going to have to move my house by the lake if I keep getting dropped in.....
If a game involves cards or dice, it's gonna be part luck
When did this get transformed into a civilised conversation about old-timey games
I'm confused
Randomize
Well, ponies, I gotta fly. Smell yah later.
^RainbowDash: well yeah, but a lot of games take this randomized factor and make it strategic
Bye gilda!
e.g. dominion
My brother made up a card game once where when you run out of cards you make up a rule and draw 5 more
Where is seth's status that everyone is talking about?
Something about Trixie
Where, not what
whoops I ran out of cards
hmmm
When you run out of cards you win
YAY
Hax...
_
ponie
So. Much. Damn. Rain.
CHEESUS
Thunderf00t
I can hear it from the center of my house, it's too much
o_o
...though it's kinda soothing inside actually,
Heh heh
Oh Greg Benson, you're awesome
Must say
Must resist... Falling asleel...
I rather like that Opera has a built-in IRC client
Orly
did not know that
I shoulda utilised it sooner lol
I really need coffee
Me neither
Yah
And I have Opera installed
Along with 4 other browsers....
If you type in an irc server in the address bar preceded by irc:// it automatically starts the IRC client.
Just snort some sugar, that keeps you awake :P
/me installs opera to check it out
What'd I say about snorting stuff?
?
Cocaine
Nah
A nosebleed WOULD keep me awake
I only recently started using opera as my main browser. I'd been using Firefox til recently but it's just gotten so stupidly bloated.
woah
it does have an irc client!
Extensions notwithstanding, Firefox should NOT need 300K to sit there doing nothing.
But I prefer not to resort to that
sounds great!
I'll have to keep this in mind...
Firefox
Is slow as hell...
And is a resource hogger.
Don't fall asleep. The pink elephants are on Parade 6_9
but firefox has the awesome plugins :d
you can try kmeleon as an alternative to ff
And then I installed Opera and it instead uses only 80K to sit there doing nothing.
Nowadays there's nothing Firefox can do that Opera can't, I've found.
Well i do like chatzilla
Or at least nothing I was using Firefox for that Opera doesn't do.
Sketchy_Sounds: is that so?
So maybe ill stick with it for a year more
(i might have to ask you for tips on that later--i could never get sound working)
The only extras I had in Firefox were script and adblocking and the web dev toolbar, maybe one or two other things.
Argh.
So tired
Piece a crap thing...
Go
I use those things all the time, so I can't not have them -.-
Opera
double negative ftw?
Opera comes with a comprehensive web dev console out of the box, ad blocking out of the box, and getting AdBlock Plus and a script blocker is a matter of a few clicks.
AWWWWWW
Rainbowdash is gone....
does it have a bugzilla replacement?
Fuuuuuuuu
What does BugZilla do? The answer is probably yes.
Ah forget it.....
Safari too
it is basically a... debugging tool for html/javascript
Considering that Mozilla have essentially been ripping off a good number of Opera's things lol
Oh, yes it does then.
helps determine which scripts are running slowly, not working properly, etc.
It has Dragonfly built in.
It's a VERY good html, JS, CSS and so forth debugger.
And it even has a jQuery console and other shiny stuff.
im gonna get some sleep, ponies. Stayed up till 2am last 2 nights and gotta get some work done tomorrow lol
/me throws Derpybot some muffins.
eh, but it isn't open source... meh
that's exactly my issue aswell...
but i'll get back to you on it once I have it sorted out
That doesn't really matter unless you're an active developer yourself.
but I am a developer -.-
A program developer or a web developer?
program
what happened to the stream yesterday?
Something went wrong after I left?
Well then I suppose it may matter a little to you.
not that I've actually looked FF source code or anything
I'm just a fan of the OS movement :)
Oh wait a minute
http://dev.opera.com/ My goodness what could this be
just an api
Oh so it is lol
/me shrugs
Even if it's not open source as such, it's still free
Oh I am Back.
Some good link in EAD xD
o my
What happened over here
$10 dollars and I only got 5+ months of work out of it...
I could have done better if I had gotten one from a dollar store
piece a crap
You get what you pay for
I know.
I have a pretty good pair of headphones
but they developed a buzzing on the mic over time :(
I have a Logitech USB headset that cost me about £20 i think and I've had it probably close to 2 years now.
But still, I've had better dollar store headsets
!lullaby

Sup guys?

Heyo Flatterscheu
http://www.xkcd.com/ Latest comic. So very very true. XD
Heyo.
/me pokes Flatterscheu
Huh?
Yes, what is it Johnsey?
/me grins mischievously
nothing! just doing the pony pokey
Ahaa.
well, it is a comparison of a 10 char password compared to a 24 char password -.-
Hehe.
My password is the best password.
Literally.
True, but the point he's making is, passwords are difficult to remember for humans and easy to crack for computers.
it's "best password"?
Hehe.
Try it.
Also, where the heck are Applejacks and Appleblooms parents?
Applejack
They aren't there when Applejack leaves the farm, when Applebloom isn't even born.
Parents you mean the rich ones?
Huh?
What.
I saw CMC ep last night
the Oranges are applejacks aunt/uncle
Oh
Yeah.
The parents are never shown.
Even before Applebloom is born.
to be fair, only 2 ponies have their parents shown
Twilight and um...
pinkie
berrypunch and her daughter
Pinkie.
Maybe season 2 will reveal to us them...
and pinkie
I meant in the mane 6 :P
That is fanon DesertRose.
:(
Hi Ossalaa
It just strikes me as odd that Appleblooms parents are gone before she is born, then go back to the farm, give birth to her, and then leave again!
dont even know the names of any of them
surprise! apple bloom is adopted!
:O
and her special talend has naught to do with apples
I dun derp'd, I accidentally jabbed the jack into my reset button XD
herpaderp
Appleblooms talent is architecture.
I called it.
But I don't think she is adopted.
Why would Granny Smith, Applejack or Big Macintosh adopt anything?
nope, adopted
not apples, therefore, adopted
Maybe it is a Appleflower?
Eh.
I think that Applebloom is Applejacks secret daughter myself.
Just as likely.
Maybe Big Mac's illegitimate child?
Heheheh ~
That could be true too.
OR BOTH.
sooo....incest?
Ehhhh
Maybe.
>Rednecks
must be
its plausible
Yup.
but never in a kiddies show
It will never be shown.
Yes.
But wouldn't the element of HONESTY have some hard trouble to hide her secret daughter?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zfGhwtbBw#&t=2m50s
:/
INCEST? THIS IS MADNESS!
link related to this discussion
LOL
xD
Ha
braeburn x applejack = applebloom?
Ohai Rodman
Maybe.
>mfw he left.
darnit.
oooh
episode 9 is up
oh god
SO, how is everybrony today?
It'd explain Applejack's seeming animosity towards him, aside from the other more obvious stuff
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kDVj5elUx0&feature=related check the top comments
yeah, still not as good as ep 5/6 though
and their thumbs
5/6 of the abridged series was so good

Can you send derpybot to a chat
Is it possible
well, you can send it a channel invite, but that's as far as you can go
!mail DerpyBot muffin inside a muffin inside a muffin
For..for me? Are there muffins inside??
yes
and I doubt derpybot would accept a channel invite
Dari / Brits: "You can get a brand new 3DS for £134.97 at online retailer GameStop right now. GameStop has made the move a couple of days ahead of the official 3DS price drop on Friday, as spotted by MCV." :O
Thank you!!
/me glomps krazyjay

Somewhere you can buy it at the reduced price.
>£250 >£135
Or buy it at the full price.
ugh, daytime television...
duuude
Then when it changes a couple days later you get the money refunded.
Imightbuythis.3ds
Because of some store deal.
Then you get 20 free games and the reduced price.

Conscience
Nyoro~n.

So what are wo doing?
Dunno
Everything
this is more "should I? but i'll just quit... i might continue if i was chatting over skype... but that gets rid of the atmosphere"
all at once
If I ever will be playing amnesia again It'll be as a let's play
just so I could talk
and not be exploding on the inside
cause I'm thinking of muting stream and watching some youtube vids atm
yeah... thats the reason why i'm not continuing
(but if we're gonna watch Doctor Who)
i would love to be able to talk

Not all bronies came from /b/. In fact, a) began on /co/ b) barely any pre-/b/ Bronies. No, we are not FUKKEN GAY KIDS IN ADULT BODIES as this vid portrays. /b/ doesn't even troll bronies anymore. Pretty much all Bronies have active lives aswell as the fandom. ALLOFMYRAGE

Oh great, he's gonna want my new nick now, isn't he.
Eh, dunno if he comes to this chat
Pegacorn - /b/, and 4chan, is generally a funny place. mostly I feel sorry for the people who spend their lives on it, but most of the time reading through it is funny. occasionally thought there's some deep shit there too.
Is that another command? xD
haven't seen him in a while either, though, he may be in /oat/ or I'm just missing something

Pegacorn - other such deep shit too. such as a few murder stories arose there first way before elsewhere, and a few genuine suicides taht days later were confirmed
Ponychan is the only one I "regulate" to these days
robotpinkie - L4D + KF
Used to use a lot of ylilauta, 4chan, and some others before then
>dat pistol sound effect from KF
Dem infected
My only brony point is EQD, though I am in the Celestia Radio chat at the moment.
#ThePortal
But you have to admit Dman that finding YOURSELF under a manhole cover is some deep shit.
tis KF mod ^_^
Lol yea Pegacorn
you dun goofed came from 4chan right?
although finding myself in a room with bjornfort is also pretty deep shit
/me retreats to his bucket.
orly?
How do you make colored topics
Ziltoid - hope. last time i was on 4chan was 07/08
I was shown it by a friend
Lawl Bjornfort.
Haha, FallSilently, I'm lurking there too
and Me being pretty laid back and tryingstuff, i tried it without even going 'lol girly' at the name. :P
Yeah, I kind of prefer chats or forums, but seeing how many use tripcodes on ponychan, it's not too bad
07!minnet
bjornfort best fort
He is insane.

Bjornfort IS insane.
How do you make colored topics guys
xDDD
and he's tapped you
/me whines, then goes to sit in a corner.

Who do you think you are?
But i am WAY more insane.
I frequent a lot of different fora, just this is the only brony one.
07LOOL What?
Lol Pegacorn.
Dunno, I use irssi, not sure how to use colors.
No.

We're all insane in Sweden.

It's a source of national pride.

07Lakorv, the hell did you do with her
Nope

Simple black against white background, that's more like it
07No, I don't have one :p
Not as insane as Bjornfort then Pegacorn.

/me is on irssi
Yeah, guess it's the "normal" layout
Well, you can't define NORMAL, really
But on this client black on white is default
my point ^_^
"DO SOMETHING OR IM BROWN BREAD"
You DO remember what i told yesterday,right Dman?
wtf i have never heard this used in britaion
*told you
Insane, I'm pretty sure you can get a fairly good idea of at a certain point. :P
Pegacorn - yes
1. In a state of mind that prevents normal perception, behavior, or social interaction; seriously mentally ill.
2. (of an action or quality) Characterized or caused by madness.
:P
1. (of a person) Of sound mind; not mad or mentally ill: "hard work kept me sane".
2. (of an undertaking or manner) Reasonable; sensible.
Defined.
Trololo.
>prevents normal perception >define normal >ipmlying perception ani't different for erryone
And it still applies today Dman.
But normal is a kind of weird mess of averages that applies to no one.
>define madness / mentally ill / of sound mind / sane / reasonable/sensible
Do it
: )

so what if I wanna go runnin through town with jeans? dealwithit. so waht if i wanna climb that building? dealwithit. so what if I wanna talk to ya while waiting for the bus, I ain't rapin' ya, just chattin'. dealwithit. Seriously, especially britain, but most of the world, they have these 'socially acceptable' standards nowadays.

You do know that copy-pasting the channel over and over doesn't win you anything if no one is interested, right?

It keeps resetting anyway.

dat aisle 2
Dat cut
07not that it matters much because I'm a fleeb
If you wanna climb the building, from experience people call the police and you get arrested for trespass.
Well I think the point is more if you run naked into an old folks' home armed with a herring.
gah
That's sort of unambiguously not sane.
there must be a bug somewhere
I can't get your data.

Hi.
Hi Fireant!
(probably 15 secs - I was typing 'OF ULTIMATE DESTINY!' )
actually
Alright, time to be killed by little girls in silly dresses!
I wonder how to make the topic to stay on a chat or make it colored
I've not implemented a way of 'owning' her like those scripts do
Hey my favorite fiery ant!
oh u mean this, or showdown, dari?
this just uses the defined owner.
DAT BEEPING
Minnet: who's your owner?
Google?
You are my bloody owner, silly.
07Ah XD
This
This is Megas XLR
Which is?
Ok fireant, I wonder how to make the topic to stay on a chat or make it colored
What's it about?
/me wonders what response she gets if
dat speed
07+ she asks that
07ff linebreaks
go try
You have a chatroom?
Its basically a parody of mecha shows in general
#ThePortal
Thats it.
Is it registered? xd
That's the best description actually
You'll see soon enough
...
How do you register it
I GAVE DAT CHICK A GIANT ROBOT.CHICKS LOVE GIANT ROBOTS.
That wasn't me this time.
"Speed. I am speed. Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beamer."
:P
#FallSilentlysPlace

Kk
07Minnet: who's your owner?
Let me help you Wheatley_Core
Alright.
07Yay she didn't insult me.

I now need to debug the database query..
Set you to operator on ThePortal.

07why? o3o
*goonwikipedia* *Megas_xlr_dvd_petition* wut. this isn't out on dvd?
Okay, nobody mess with Derpy for about 10 minutes.
Let her get settled in first.
Never made a DVD, no
lol fireant but ok
because something failed
17:45:15 [Minnet] Hey, you're not authorised for this operation!
*derp*
Google have all the answers.
07LOL
/me 's Random Megas XLR Trivia: The muscle car used as the head of Megas is a modified 1970 Plymouth Hemi Cuda Convertible.
there's a new command called !moon, but I don't recommend using it.
So does /msg botname help
:P
He said my story was cool and called me bro.
That's so sad, Rodman :(
lol Pegacorn
must be a bug that snuck in while I did various fixes.
...now we /have/ to use it, johnsey|workmode!
Does it ban the user :/
I wouldn't if i were you
Yeah, very sad
07what kind of personality does she have, anyway? I kind of get the impression that she's reluctant about everything, including functioning. XD
The community didn't allow it to die though :D
:)
haha
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait
she's, I dunno.. snappy.
/me thinks Minnet is a tsundere
13hello Minnet
13xD
Spock alien
ah, just like Rocko's Modern Life
Suddenly GIGA DRILL BREAKA
intredesting
07I've been called a tsundere, once upon a time. But maybe that'd fit Minnet more.
/me 's random megas xlr trivia: Originally entitled Lowbrow, the pilot episode was shown during Cartoon Network's 2002 Summer Contest to determine which cartoon would become a new Cartoon Cartoon; it was the most popular among viewers. After being delayed from its original debut in December 2003, Megas XLR finally debuted on Toonami on May 1, 2004
:D
Okay, pull straws.
DAT LASER BATTERY
a whatnow
07Uh
Someone has to !moon.
Minnet: be an annoying pile of malfunctioning code
/me is an annoying pile of malfunctioning code >:)
fuck yeah Cartoon Cartoon!
I'm going to !moon.
dat bad sign.
!moon
/me voted for Billy & Mandy
Grab my tail, FallSilently!
yes
07have this, Lakorv: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere
hmm
13Oh wow I was about to link that
what other shows were around at this specific time?
oh lords
13xD
tvtropes
trying to remember what I saw at this time
I consider that BONDING.
07Angel, I beat you to it
Dexter's Lab was pretty much done by then
/me 's Character despriptions: Harold "Coop" Cooplowski (David DeLuise): The pilot of Megas and the main protagonist, Coop is overweight and has an insatiable appetite. Due to years of playing video games, he is an excellent pilot. He's not exactly the brightest person around—his amazing heroics are just accidents, and he usually ends up destroying more than
!sun
/me he protects. Coop also is quite strong as depicted by his demonstrations of raw power, such as being able to punch a car window and breaking it without flinching or using a wrench to wreck a null distortion missile on Megas. The number on his jacket is 12.
Minnet doesn't love.
07Haha
Nopony gets banished to the sun, that'd be ridiculous!
I WOULD VOTE FOR THAT
yet anyway.
/me hides
THE DOOM SONG!
It'd be okay at night.
: D
DAT JUNK PILE!
07Oh god, lol, are you going to have her be selectively nice? LOL
imma let you finish, but GUESS WHO MADE WAFFLES?!?
07that's gonna be kinda scary XD
FallSilently has a point
FFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
(not so tightly)
Too bad the Eyes never got that evidence
Maybe so, but I was the turkey all along.
...?
$2
$2
>anything
OH dear.
Octavia? You okay over there?
TWO. FUCKS. XD
Megas is worth $2
>find mecha > TWO. BUCKS. > Profit.
Lol
Rarity reference.
just did that
M.E.G.A.S.S
>spend hours building it before even looking inside
don't think I can be bothered at the moment
lol! burger
hm.. could this be it?
!moon
Grab my tail, Idledancer!
Minnet: reload your database functions

Awesome
Mwhahahahahaha

Fireant
god I hate this class
So, Dari, you'd never seen this show?
at least this is the last day
Not cool guys. Don't abuse this new command.
Nope.
!moon
That was amazing.

Oh man
Wheatley, unban me :p
I did.
What you've missed
What is this
I believe I did.

Grab my tail, Jazza!
Grab my tail, Paul_McColtney!
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Thank you!!
/me glomps Wheatley_Core
oopa
oops *
better.
07Lakorv: funfact, that article also was required reading for me. Along with 'clingy jealous girl'. And a tsundere is basically a character who alternates between being irritable and lovestruck, lol
HAHA called it :P
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Thank you!!
Consequences will never be the same
/me glomps johnsey|workmode
/me plugs her ears with some muffins
Dat epic zoom
07I don't really like tvtropes much. Too many floof associations.
a tsundere is a bipolar-ish-mooded person.
Lets not use the !moon command that much anymore
</summedUp>
ATUPID SPE
how can a bot be lovestruck?
I mesan
*mean
13They often use the phrase "I'm not doing this b-because I like you or anything, stupid. So don't get the wrong idea"

whats the !moon command?
SUDDENLY COOP IS THE BEST ^_^
07what IS the difference then?
07and drf
trololol
07I saw that comic
07; ; kinda made me sad, but oh well
Justanotherpony, if you haven't been paying attention it sends you TO THE MOON (you get kicked)
OK
like disconnecting.
/me 's random character trivia: Kiva Andru (Wendee Lee): Kiva is a military pilot and engineer who traveled back in time from over a thousand years in the future. Also the deuteragonist, She has a no-nonsense personality, but adopts a small sense of humor as the series progresses, and is highly skilled in both robotic and hand-to-hand combat.
ah
/me Kiva is knowledgeable, tough, and fearless. Originally meant to be the pilot of Megas, she can no longer pilot it due to Coop's modifications, and finds herself stuck in the present time. Instead of driving MEGAS herself, she tries to train Coop. Kiva usually operates a holographic panel in Megas's back seat.
07Bah.
07I can't make her die in a fire
now you know why I didn't know about that thing :P
07but

This is minnet.lua 0.7.0 - the unuseful lua irc bot
For a full list of functionality, ask for help on the commands.

The available commands are:

That should be a feature.

9we start with a movie (this Saturday: Macross: Do You Remember Love)
Ah ok NewDCD got it!

(actually because the list lacks room for it)
I can, but that'll boot me and not a random innocent member of the proletariat.
can !moon kick mods too?
mm... we're in Daylight savings time though, so technically it's EDT
CogWeaver: try it :D

Happy Zylophone music time~
I'm actually rather surprised that name wasn't taken.
Dem weird credit cards
dat cronkburger
so, Dari. Did you think The End of Time was a good episode arc?
Xylophone*
/me , as a Pony (think RP), hugs Pegacorn.
That picture in my head makes me smile :)
Is that with Yana and Jack?
Nah
>900 y/o master of time and space. "ya jus' need a bi'a grub" XD
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUCK Balloons
/me stands behind CogWeaver, glowering
Ah okay
I love Dr Who
:P
mrr.. logics be failing me.
that'S the other arc with the Master
:)
I'm taking it LIKE A BAWS.
how could you Dman! you owe all your hugz to the ones who guessed your mp3
So ops can do it to each other, but non-ops can't do it to tops.
ops
I hate arithmetics
I see, thanks Xiagu.
/me Hugs GGgala
The End of Time is the last Tennant episodes
HECK
and logic for that matter
/me hugs Dermathil
Ahh.
/me hugs RObotpinkie
/me hugs Violetvanilla
There
Is NewDCD still here?
So all we plebs have to do is convert an op to our cause.
aw

this should do it.
/me hugs Dman
The Doctor: He's a social experiment!
Minnet: reload db.lua
Lakorv: I reloaded db.lua.
:) robotpinkie
My god Dman,you don't have to hug everypony!
I think they kind of messed up the Master.
I have tea.
Pegacorn oh yes. I do.
Oh, sorry
I think Tennant was awesome though.
I.F.T.
>flying in through the roof
Robotpinkie you'r edrinking tea right now? I'm drinking tea right now!
Like a baws.
/me pumps fist, whispers "Yes!" aside
I.F.T.2.
Tea is awesome
I loved that episodic arc.
That'll be difficult, because they're all filthy rich and gorgeous enough to have their pick of the fillies.
eyup
Why so Dman?
GO DEEPER
It was a pretty:
WHAT A TWEEST!
Pegacorn - spread the love
Lot of episodes.
...
Filthy, maybe.
mm beef slush puppy
I liek beef.
(the Master had the pounding in his head from as soon as the first episode with him
Dat philosophy Dman
I'd say "rich" and "gorgeous" are a stretch.
In relation to all mane 6 i'm most similar to pinkie - i can't stay still unless doing stuff. even on pc, my hands sorta twitch amd move 'less i'm typing :)
400 fillies!
i don't hold many parties thou
Hey
gtg,seeya all later
True, but it does mean you get kicked instead of me.
Rich and Gorgeous it may be too.
Your fillies will run as fast as Kenyans!
cya
Cee ya later Pegacorn

disturbingly sensual villain-executive-guy
13Well you HAD been working on it for ages :P
/me raises kitten

Dat 'safety'
PonyThirst?
6I'm determined to beat it before I go back home on saturday
You know
I watched it by myself? :'D
6I did some stupid stuff yesterday though
6I kept running into enemies
I"m actually rather surprised nobody's ponified Brawndo or Powerthirst yet.
Somepony make it happen.
6and I was like HMM I'M NOT RAGEQUITTING
Ah that one. Dari as I say i sorta view some shows and stuff. I have seen about 5 episodes of that one.
did the Doctor just say A STREAM?
6and I managed to get to satori's last card with such a horrible run
6and then I ran into her
Dat referenceforeshadowcontinuity
STREAMCEPTION AGAIN WTF?
a stream inside a dream
AN STREAM
AtomicBrony, I heard a ponified Powerthirst on Celestia Radio today, searched youtube, found nothing
13LOL
"too much info. her head'll explode" 'Doctordonna' people
MEOW
13I always do best on my first run
trollface.jpg
NYA
13and any other run after that in the same day gets progressively worse .w.
Shh the spoilers.
:P
6it's usually my 4th run
So, is it "Giggle at the Ghostie" or "Giggle at the Ghostly?"
Dari - oh snap sorry!
I think it is ``ghostly''
6but half the time, I
6I'll make ONE stupid mistake
6and reagequit
>mfw Dr. Dari Song
I always thought it was Ghostie
Its Giggle at the Ghosties!
13I do that a lot LOL
dat Simon Pegg again
*DUN* Double Snap, keep forgetting about the DUN if I say ur name
Because the rest of the words are adjectives too
Or giggle at the Goatse xD
^Do not google that.
I LOVE the villain on this episode. . .
Makes sense.
6I've perfectly memorized the first stage
>mfw this is exactly like detention in secondary schools uk
6like, down to how many enemies and from what side of the stage, and what color
'yep sir sorry sir yep sir sorry sir that's right sir sorry sorry'
6thats how many times I ragequit
Well of course, who wouldn't love the villain here?
XD
"SAY MY NAME, BITCH"
It is Ghostie
"MY NAME, MOTHAFUCKA, DO YA SAY IT?"
And do not Google anything containing the letters "g" "o" "a" "t" "s" or "e" in the same word.
How do you know, Atomic?
dat social commentary
*derp*
XD
HUGGING!
doctor you slut
"Alright! I'll hug anyone!"
Because that's what Dan Ingram called it.
@pony The pony that's most similar to RobotPinkie

Don't ask me to find it though, it's waaaaayyy back there

That's awesome robotpinkie!
CUPCAKES
O^O
Dman: that's the intro to Dai-Guard
LOL
13I dunno whether to work on SA or UFO next
the l and i key are pretty close together though...and it was a Twitter feed...
hey, Jack is an officer and a gentlemen I'll have you know!
it was very likely a typo
Haha, now that I can believe.
he's hard working, doesn't run outta energy honest, cool guy
They keep saying Baa ba ba ba
Dermathil i know but haven't seen >_<
Random quick question (since I can't decide): Kebab or Pizza?
You said this earlier : >
Pizzabab
Pizza
depends on what's on 'em
Kebab is horror.
13normally I'd go for UFO but it's been forever since I last played it, and I forgot all the tactics I had for using the UFOs efficiently
like the part of the intro that goes 'Bara'
One kebab = half glass of pure fat.
Technically you can combine them into a Kebab Pizza.
that's my favorite part
6I never realized how much grazing is a part of this game
Stupid autocorrect, I text my dad to ask if I should buy my friend's iPod, only iPod doesn't register in the dictionary, so I ended up asking my dad if buying an opossum in good condition was a good idea
total false advertising
twltter?
My genuine preference would be pizza.
6until just yesterday
much? :P
Calzone
Snowing in floor 500~

13!espeon
6PERFECT IDEA

Now I want pizza.

GGgala ah ok then :3

Kebab on a kebab
:O Dermathil MFW i've heard this somewhere
On a pizza

On a kebab
Kebabception.
like, not similar, but EXACTLY THIS
You're right, it was a kebab filled pizza :P
Cyber men.
i recognise
6angel
on a pizza
6you need to play extra
like the first episode of Buffy: "were there marks on the body?" "Morbid much? I didn't ask!"

Pizza in Pizza?
Pizzception.
That needs to be an MLP song
Dman: from SRW Z2

The theme is instrumentalized in the game
S3?
No idea, they remind me of lots of UWAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA *dies of fright*
:P
Silly, there will be no Season 3.
Yes, S2 is already well into production
Anyway, thanks! Pizza was voted. Time to order food. Yum.
13But it takes me forever to memorise those stages D:
also bbl
yeah, they'll skip right over S3 and go straight to S4
Pfft, screw you, there's gonna be a season 3
13I still haven't beat Suwako yet, though I've come close several times
Just you wait and see
uwahahaaaa? Like, What Rarity says?
6FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
no, they'll just skip it
6I had a perfect run giong
6and then I did something stupid
6ONE AGAIN, MY 4TH RUN
the plastic sheets are like the ones they wrapped Laura Palmer in
Hello! it's me!
I'm slowly converting one of my friends into a brony.
they're inherently morbid
Well, if there's a season 4, then there's bound to be more
13LOL
Robotpinkie - hi five man!

Nothing more awesome than people who were previously uninterested asking about the show.
Dari - annoys me they just stand there with a huge scream
They are in the future, maybe they've had fainting goat DNA spliced in?

Yea Dari
Nope.
O lol k
They're stored on the server.
I see
Minnet: what's your server's uptime?
Lakorv: The server went up 2 days, 18 hours and 16 minutes ago.
Probably stored encrypted too.
Presumably hashed, too.
yfw i've had dman and d_man with passwords for like months now xP
juuuust in case
yea
We might switch over to our network some time though.
I want to restart to get the 3.0.1 kernel running, but I want to keep the uptime going.. also annoying wireless drivers going bork on kernel upgrade.
"yus" "yes"
what's the new network URL?
What do you mean GGgala?
I feel like Tennant, when in danger / pissed, has a LOT more presence than any other doctor
i mean, are you setting up your own IRC server or choosing a different one?
Tennant when he disregards all the 'rules' time lords have to obey.
Fear him.
exactly, Dman.

: / dat smith hate. I'm gonna accept it i've actually flinched a few times

Eh, I know some people dislike Smith, that's fine, I just don't agree.
=]
Never before have people been as accepting and tolerating :3
According to rules
You can swear
Dari do you remember 'yesterday I died' dr who music vid I posted a few weeks ago?
just not like a sailor
The upside of Smith for me is that whoever the next Doctor is, it can only get better from now.
yeh
not gonna request nao cuz it's sad, but it's also legendary tier imo :3
^^
Yeah Dman.
MARTHA
Lol Dari
Its hard to show what i cannot post here without posting it <<
I still want Eddie Izzard as the next Doctor
but I like to keep it to a minimum when I'm moderating
MARTHA JONES!
They don't want me spending my own money to get the iPod, but if I write a 1000 word essay on why I can't use my dad's old mp3 player for university, they'll pay for it
MARTHA IS AWESOME
Smith can't act is an acceptable accusition
I don't get why he hasn't been picked already, I mean Jesus
Marthaaaa
BUT MARTHA IS AWESOME Companion
Black Doctor or woman Doctor next plox.
: /
Something different.
Woman?
...I mean.... Celestia... not Jesus.
But oh well, apple cider sure is delicious
i vote Indian doctor
it keeps things in a brighter mood if the use of explicitives is kept on the down-low
Yeah I'd like to see a female Doctor, too.
black doctor would have to be black dynamite
LOL
I mean there's no reason they couldn't have one, I mean they'll just have to explain it later.
Jennifer Saunders for 12th Doctor!

6Do you have to follow the little girl and protect her throughout the whole game?
XD
3x kick = always ban?
This video's top comment:
get bucked out of the chat huh
The thing I loved about the tenth doctor was his﻿ energy. He had just the right balance of seriousness and madness. I miss him.
One of them anyway.
And there are other Mp3 players out there
for guests
I agree.
for DerpyBot, yes, Lawdee
yeah
there are android mp3 players? o.O
aha
Everything isn't Android/Apple ya know :p
no
I guess O.o
Tennant was crazy and serious enough both
Android mp3 player applications
I've not been following the techs, so..
The moon thing can get you banned?
oh
Tom Baker.
Five-minute ban
okay.
There aren't any decent ones imo
Winamp on Android plz
5 minutes ON THE MOON!
well it's a phone.
for all the other sentient mods though, it's Warn->Kick->Warn->Ban(24hrs)->Warn->PermaBan
oh the reading was me, but i want doctor who next now
Smith is like on an imbalanced scale and jumps from one side to the other, tilting it heavily each time
he
(MOAR DOCTOR)
Winamp's app sucks Hyper
it has a real good story to it. you should buy it its only 8.00
Baw :P
Exactly Lakorv, that's why I'd rather a separate mp3 player
I grew up watching Tom Baker on TV, though it was reruns.
6Only? o.o
so get a proper one

Mostly because my friend's selling one for the cheap
I cringe at Smith's acting. :/
I would recommend the Cowon D2, but it's not produced anymore I don't think.
stream trouble?
Still, Tom Baker is pretty much who I associate most with Doctor Who, he was awesome
doesnt give a lot of time to grab on
~45 hours of playback time <3
it's like a modern trial by ordeal, if after 5 minutes on the moon you're not dead then you're judged as innocent
nope
or at least 40.
I bet the average sansa is cheaper than a iPod on sale :P
Yeah capture not centered, dari

If I write a 1000 word essay on why I can't use my dad's old mp3 player for university, they'll pay for it
WOAH LOL
Oh... that's not good.
I fail to see the point in that
Luna should just get the old Mp3 for free :P
That is by far the most random essay ever
Her parents should just say no in general xD
http://www.wynntrading.com/Picture.aspx?width=190&height=190&id=7810259 that being my dad's old mp3 player
Ok.
Was just making something to eat.
dari's back? yay
Better than a iPod for sure
03OMG sigh
03I was in a car accident...
hurrah
What?
DRF :O
Holy ffff
Are you okay?
03Yes
03I am
Are you okay
Are you ok?
03basically
ood
03I was driving down the road
Lolhivemind
03ran over something
03tire blew out
If it's still lagging I'll just lower the quality.
aO.o
Stream's up.
03veered off the road and destroyed a guy's mailbox
03he gets pissed, comes running at me like YOU DESTROYED MY $400 MAILBOX
kittehs
.... *snort*
03I'm like, uh, I don't have any money with me but I can give you my insurance information
03he's like screw it, I'm calling the police
What a self centered guy
Lol moron
03he told the police he thought I was drinking, too
03fricking idiot
03well
03I go to the nearest side road
03call AAA
03Get my spare tire put on
got it
03which is actually a full sized tire LOL but still
He's like most of the people in my home town
lag again?
03fricking police give me a ticket for failure to report an accident, sicne I panicked and didn't realize I had to call the police
scheisse
03but he said if I pay the guy for the mailbox and then make a court date, and they confirm I took care of it, they'll void the ticket
03but sigh, paying $400 for someone's mailboxZ?
03-Z
Ok.
03Plus I need to get my tire replaced...
03and the mirror, which also broke
I'll lower the quality then.
That really sucks
My ISP be derpin'.
You don't seem to have luck with vechiles
And I can't spell today
03LOL I know right
Well voiding a ticket is better, trust me
03yeah
Ok, give me a minute.
But yeah that's harsh
03since I don't want points on my license
03but seriously, stupid idiot has a $400 mailbox
Yeah
03I'd buy him a $20 mailbox LOL
Ahahah do it!
Well
03um
03well
03the guy has to be happy with it
03as much as a $125 ticket is probably cheaper
03insurance rates would go up etc
Was it a specialized mailbox?
03I dunno, I didn't see it
03I was too busy going WOOOOOAH
Well yeah but if you're replacing it
03well
I figure he would have explained it
03I'll have to talk to him
03no
03the guy was too busy being mad
03to care
Ok, stream's up.
03he just wrote down my license plate number and called the police >_>
Plus, 400 is not a normal mailbox
I can't believe he cared more about his mailbox
03I offered to give him my insurance info
streamception
03well to be fair Luna
what are you streamoing?
13LOL sorry, I shouldn't laugh
In which case it could be specialized
Doctor Who
13but he shouldn't be making such a big deal over a silly mailbox
03what would it look like if someone's driving down the road normally and then just randomly drives off the road and destroys your mailbox
season 1?
13and why he bought such an expensive one, I've no idea
03you'd be like WTF are you smoking
yep
13I'm sure it does the same job as a much cheaper one
03but he didn't even want me to explain, he was just like pay me
03I know right
Angel, landscaping probably
ugh I can't believe it
Lag better now?
03and well
03my mom owes me $600
03so I can just pay him with that
03>_>
NOPE.AVI
Having a mailbox that fits with the yard
Well I don't see why not actually, interet seems to be alright.
03my first priority is getting the tire replaced though
im lagging pretty but thats my fault
lol
same day SF643D comes out (x2 boo)
03as the spare is totally rusted
Refresh the page?
it may just be your computers
before the shops open ><
cause the stream looks fine to me
Hm.
refreshing doesn't change anything for me
13We don't have a mailbox, we just have letters put straight through the door o-o
03that's common in the UKL
03-L
We have a standard mailbox, but we're working on getting a specialized
Well I dunno then.
My gran's condo has the same type of door xD
I don't think it's my internet any more.
03LOL
03we just have a normal one
Hey RainBro.
03it's just a wood base with the mailbox on top of it
03black metal
hi Ecco!
hey rainbrodash
03then we have some covers we put on it to make it look nice but still
13Omg I somehow saw an M on the end of condo

@pony Spam
6 Spam is 14Hoity-15Toity
"Your life's so sad it's funny, but your friends are hungry so just cut the stupid cake..."
10so dari, what you gonna do
6angel I realized my problem
6in SA
10do something funnny *poke* :P
6I'm so used to EoSD/PCB style gameplay, I keep forgetting you technically have unlimited bombs
6since they're based on power, not count
6I'm always afraid to waste a bomb
maybe play the 'look at my horse, my horse is amazing' song?
6forgetting that I can replenish it
Juggle onions while wearing a shoe as a hat.
6thats why I keep dying I think lol
True....
13LOL yeah, took me a while to adjust to that
10the stream topic doesn't say I have no balls?
/me 10has balls
...do you always juggle onions, though?
02._. .-.
13just don't go too crazy with it, or you'll end up feeling so helpless when you're stuck with no power |D
6but I still dont think I can bring myself to bomb easily in boss fights due to the power reduction
im back
02Unlimited bombs?
6yeh
oh god
welcome back
No, you don't have balls till you sing.
sing it brother
you're just in time for the video-free stream Ziltoid
6yeh
/me 10has balls, and nopony can stop me
But I don't feel the need to restate that you don't have them, it's obvious.
I think I might watch some Torchwood...
6you know how in EoSD/PCB/IN you had like 4 bombs per life?
6or 3
6whichever
02yeah
6in MoF and SA (and I think UFO), it's based purely on how much power you have
inb4 this is the national anthem of Equestria in Season 2
lawl
6you're given variables, 1,2,3, and 4
02o-o
6 1 being your lowest power
dohohoho
13Nah, UFO brought the bomb feature back
6but at 2,3,and 4, you can use a bomb
13and MoF has a max power of of 5
6but it brings your power down one entire varible
quick guys
6so if you're at max power at 4.0
6use a bomb
/me 10wants something to do
someone who wasn't from BMN posted a leverage thread
10;P
6you're down to a power of 3.0
I need the leverage images
02yo go down to -- ninja'd
6but you can gain power ups and bring that back to 4 very quickly
02yeah I get it
6yep
6I keep forgetting this
so no more video?
preferably the "niggas be posting in a leverage thread"
sadface
I have none... so sad...
6so I keep trying to get through the game like I do in EoSD
6first 4 stages, no bombs
/me 10WILL NOT SING
10GTFO
you're the one with the mic whore
6that doesnt work LOL
6actually
I <3 you dari
hey, Prison sang
6I can do most of satori's castle without a bomb
10bullshit can you stream a skype call
13Also the bombs in MoF and SA aren't as effective
10do it faggot
6I only used it once because I accidentally bordered to the other side
SING OR TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAA!
lol
6yukari's bomb
6is awesome
6BOMB, float to top of screen, instant power up to max again
02How so? @Angel
doesn't seem that different from streaming a video playing
10your mic would have to be next to your mouth and speakers at the same time though
10do it.
ohai Polarfire
6it's basically like using a costless bomb having yukari
omg
BMN mod duet
02lol, hax
13MoF's bombs are basically a large bubble around your character that destroys bullets near you, but doesn't clear the screen of bullets entirely
10fair :D
dari, I doth <3 you
02Oh I see... ._.
13and SA's bombs, well I'll probably just never get used to them |D
I now officially declare the holy war over
10Yeah man
*flap flap*
10NO MAN
6Angel, who do you use for SA?
so
much
WANT
Haha
6cuz that's how it works still except Yukari's really
So where's the leverage thread?
I could sing
10.... possibly
6it doesn't clear any bullets until the end
6where it clears EVERYTHING lol
12...
Winter Wrap-Up BMN mod Skype singalong? DO WANT

02Hi Hawwwkie~
@robotpinkie:
13I use Suika most of the time
Hooray
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36438923.html
13occasionally Yukari
0218 mins left ._. .-. ._.
6I found out that using suika isn't such a brilliant idea
lol oh it's in /oat/, I was looking in /chat/
6I used to do it since her ability is nice
6but it gets you too used to the cheap way
6and you miss ALL the bonuses
10do ho ho
/me 10loves RainBroDash
13Her bomb isn't that good either and still makes me feel vulnerable .w.
RAINBROCEPTION
RainBroCest
Self love. It's a wonderful thing.
6yeah
DOUBLE RAINBRO: The Fan Fiction
6try either yukari or alice
6I actually want to learn patchouli
6but holy ffffff
Self love is much better if you have a split personality, though.
6that is WAY too much to understand all at once
6UH UH UH, FIRE SHOT, NO WAIT EARTH SHOT
6NO
6WAIT
6AAJHRGBD
13LOL Patchouli
13so many shot types
13so little time to think about it
lol
it probably BELONGS in chat
but the OP put it in oat
6yeah
6I don't know how anyone can understand that
6but some people do
6and it makes it the easiest team to use in the game
12bree?
Who started it this time?
6yukari has a strong shot, a wonderful bomb, and I'm finally seeing how her ability works
Self love is much better if you have a clone.
some random person
/me 10still loves RainBroDash
Mako Ruu
So leverage has spread beyond BMN eh...
It starts with one...
6lets try this again
well, it was bound to be noticed

but there are also a lot of pseudo-nukes, like N2 mines
like, more than in other country's scifi
also, the use of the name nuka-launcher for the fatman in japanese versions of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New-Vegas

9Barry: I'm writing a Kamen Rider crossover, so we're in a similar boat
OH
before I forget
Barry, i think you might hurry, it may have be in the works, if the number of videos i've seen are any clue
DCD, that SRW anime you showed us yesterday
what was it called?
9Super Robot Wars OG: The Inspector
awesome
ty
I have a friend who's a super anime nerd
/me takes off his work vest. woo
and I couldn't remember the name >.<
The premise is basically Fluttershy, Applejack, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash as Pony Rangers
Wow, things are heating up, here.
Twilight will appear later, similar to how Tommy appeared
so twilight is the white ranger
10SilverMane is a pizza pony ;D
Green Ranger, first
I must admit I know this all too well
oh right
again, many thanks to DCD :P
Yes, I'm making her evil for a time
i have those VHS tapes, of the green ranger
I had to import Johto DVDs from Australia and New Zealand
http://miburl.com/JPGiLP saw this at a bike shop gonna bye it for sure its called a Huffy Custom Liner
Nightmare Moon takes the place of Rita Repulsa
how the fuck is there always one ranger so powerful that he/she can beat ALL the other rangers, but if/when they join up with the rangers, they aren't OP anymore

It's a conspiracy!
I don't know what to do anymore x.x

Oh, yes, the story will have anthro ponies
I'm very good today.
I think it's funny how there is a real Kanto region in Japan
Barry, i like where this is going
I like it when they do that kind of stuff in a show.
How are you, Sathi?
/me puts on his work hat
It's the only way I can conceive to make it work

Purple... Celestia?
and they currently have angry birds pillows as well

LOLWUT

ah
Celestia should be a very light pink, why the fuck are they making it darker with each incarnation?
don't be a foal she's been purple like from the start
oh good... well not good, but at least they didn't fuck up any harder
it's really frustrating that the most show accurate toy is pink >.<
9>let 0er rip
9*'er
his purple is our pink.
maybe it was the lighting
yes most probably.
swear she was purple
but sigh
I might have to wait several MONTHS to go to court

How about an iPhone app that detonates a bomb in his vicinity?
iBomb
4uh
9yes Ivorian?
4that's already been done
just plant the bomb disguised as something other than a bomb, open the app, press the big red button, BAM
4don't you see the news? oh wait what am i saying
/me 4fleews
4*flees
you need to send me some links for DAI GAADO
not detonated with an iPhone app, though
that's more complex :p
because instead of just having to make the bomb and push a button at a time
hehe
you have to buy the iPhone, get a cellular data contract and/or have a Wi-Fi connection, download the app, and set it up to sync with the bomb
somebody set up us the bomb
OH U Akagi, such a mecha otaku :3c
4uh
4not TOO complex
4how about
Or you could just use a android app which'll be a bit better

2good point
12Because they told you there passwords, I hope |D
wuh
SOMEONE ELSE CHECK
NOTTO PANISHAA that faggot up.
2>v> what if not???
'cause mine shows my first one being way early.
most likely is chatlag on either of our (or both) side
YOUR S IS LOWER CASE
:o
nah
12lol yep
just the time between our locations
3LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
the time the info moves
I saw on Dr. Oz that it's a good idea to share your passwords with your loved ones when in a relationship
9I love the idiosyncratic episode title cards in this series
12Yes I am :p
so that you can't keep secrets
yeah
9DAT WAIFU
13what if said couple go through something nasty
13and out of revenge
13one of them hacks into the other's account
13and messes it up
13xD
I'm heading off to bed, night guys
Change them before things get nasty? xD
Im reading the northumbria police twitter feed where I am, no riots or anything but lots of single robberies happening in Newcastle which I kinda need to go to this week :\
but still, I have to disagree myself

9SKURAMBERU?
I'm simply forced to watch it thanks to AFN

12Anyways, the S was made small to get people to stop calling me NS XD
there isn't much else better to watch here :\
13Let the internet become your TV like me
13:D
12And it’s actually been somewhat working
computer (though I don't have one on my PC), iPad, etc.
I heard about this place called Protect Free TV
it looks kinda good
13I have the same password for everything, hence why I'm so reluctant to let anyone know what it is
13because then they'd have instant access to everything on the internet that belongs to me
12Is it floof?
I have some passwords for certain things, different ones for others
/me runs
3that way they can see who you're cheating on them with
/me 3flees
/me 3starts a new game on Flora Sky :)
3hmm, i'm gonna look for a vid

12Same here
I heard about a guy who did that before he kissed his wife
3whoa seriously?
yeah
I saw it on the news one time, and it was pretty weird
3what happened?
Pattyrick, Project Free TV is crawling with viruses
3DID THE WIFE SLAP HIM ACCROSS HIS FACE!!!
He got married, and right as the priest said 'I now pronounce you husband and wife', he pulled out his phone and updated his status
It isn't there fault, but the place the videos are hosted have viruses
oh boy
perhaps I shouldn't go there
I only heard about it, haven't downloaded anything from it ye

I heard it is an awesome movie.
that's good to hear
Been trying to watch it for two to three weeks now

9well lookie there
9GLORIOUS QUALITY
4LAWL
lol, DCD takes pride in his streaming :P
9looks MUCH better now, doesn't it?
9of course I do
9I'm OCD for this sort of things
7Hmm, DRF: the font I used last time for your multi-image notes is too big for the axes.
9NEW OCD
9that said
7Could I use the smaller font?
GLOOOOOOOOOOOOORIOUS STREAMING!
03sure
7I mean, it still fits.
9this truly is the optimal quality, I believe.
Dat explosion
7It just looks big. O_o
03that small font is fine
9the only thing is
9white instead of yellow?
9ect.
meh, dubs never bother me
so long as I can see what's going on I'm content :P
dat static
7You want those phase change words in there, too?
.....NewDCD,will you accept my Steam friend reqeust or not?
*request
9sorry
9OMW
OMW?
On My Way
ok
03Yes
7Can I abbreviate?
7Because writing 'pressure' and 'temperature' takes up half of the width.
7Unless I squeeze the spacing.
9there we go
offline
YAY
7And the actual graph is different in both of your links.
Best comment ever: "This show is to traditional notions of masculinity what penicillin was to syphilis. "
7Specifically, the solid-to-liquid line is at a different angle.
what, my little pony?
Syphillis?
as in...the disease
oH NVM
what Henry VIII died of :P
03sure
Yes, anon
03just do temp. and however you can think of to abbreviate pressure
03though for the pressure side
03you can do it vertically if you know how to.
best comment ever: 'We get off on your tears'; developer of 'Demons Souls', on the difficulty of the game
And yeah, syphillis is kinda rare nowadays (though I still think that's what caused Charlie Sheen, since tertiary syphillis essentially eats your brain)
7I know.
anon: Sounds a bit like something the Ninja Gaiden (NES) developers would say.
guess who i am! i bet you can't
Henry VIII?
dammit val...
i mean, what? no, how rediculous
HE'S A ZOMBIE GOAST
Ryu Hayabusa?
7So the direction of that slant...
7Should it be left or right?
SHOOT THE ZOMBIE GOASTS
BUT BE SAD FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY CANNOT LIVE HER
i am not Goatees
how do you shot web?
No, just giggle at the ghosties
also am I the only one who sees the stream as offline?
nope, it's off
ah, kk
so we doing this guessing 20 questions style or just random guess style?
whatever you want, dearie
?
hmmmmm
i already dropped a major clue
/me is torn between the spiderman reference and the dearie comment
but you probably werent here for when the reference was created
dearie is a very English thing to say
...sure, why not
WE NEED TO PROTECT THE BRIEFCASE!
03hm
03ah
03to the left, preferrably
03that second image is the phase diagram of water
are you, perchance a particular mod?
03ultimately no two mixtures are the same XD
nope
Ahem.Gentlemen?
truly? innnnnnteresting....
Mentlegen?
/me has a dead Spy on his shoulder.
are you a regular to the weekday streams, or just the main BMN events?
you uh... have something on your, umm, shoulder, just there
i'm here almost daily
were you on here earlier today?
I know i have a dead Spy on my shoulder.I killed him when you weren't looking.
7So \?
03right
03just barely though
03it's vertical with a slight slant
probably val
/me would like it if he wasn't the only one guessing :P
7Okay.
probably? as in you don't know?
i'm special
/me drops the dead Spy on a table
/me flutters his wings in discomfort
4well, bye!
damn it pegacorn quit rping and help me guess
7http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/4969/temporaryfile2.png <-- I squeezed it into this. XD
7Hey, Chao.
4hi Quany
4bye Quany
4bye drf
7Okay. o3o
I think mib_zfd3bu is Dman.
03holy crap I can't view that at all
okay- last question before I give up in frustration:
03let me try it on my calculator
03since for some reason
damn
03just zooming in on my computer doesn't work
7O_o
no pegacorn
was gona ask if he understood the story of Dai-Guard :P
7Open in MS Paint and magnify?
but that answers that question
nope nope nope
welp, I'm just going to randomly guess
Bjorn?
eww
>random
03nah
I give up
03I'll just put it on my calculator
ANWSER VALTHEJEAN'S GUESS!
he did
"eww"
IT IS I, THE MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE!
now wait just a damn minute
Ohai SilverMane.
Silvermane WAS here earlier
and I said Maybe
and I eliminated you as a suspect because I was talking to you earlier
and then said I'm special
because i am too tired to say yes
okay, well that eliminates the point of answering questions if you give false info :P
wasn't false, as simply awkward
now, do i want McDonalds or Taco Bell
Hallo
hello
Now that the question of who mib_zfd3bu really is has been anwsered,i must find out who this Spy is.
03hm
mmm... quesadilla time.
dead, the spy is
03the "gas" looks like "gac"
.....Dat yoda joke.
03otherwise that's good
But really,i must find out who he is.
7I know, the ses look like cs.
He,she,it,whatever.
03can you fix that lik eyou did for the other images? :/
7Larger? Sure.
03OK

03see how it has that line
03hm
03I suppose I can just do that myself.
7Include it?
03basically yes
7If you can fit it. XD
7Or I could take care of it.
03I'll try
03well
03if you want to
03I don't mean to sound demanding :/
Help me find out guys!
7Well, you're not. :)
03like if you can just put little points where the horizontal line intersects for melting and boiling upoints
03-u
03and maybe put a "MP" and "BP" near them?
7Hmm...
GODDAMNIT!
hmmm. nah

awwww
ugh
Teen Titans is better :P
11...
what have i walked into
9just testing for quality with different video sources
11It's sad that I liked the old costume design better.
....
11Hell, even the voice is worse.

Mr. Freeze's voice is epic, shame everyone elses sucks

9I'm going to PUSH MY STREAM FURTHER
WE NEED TO GO STREAMER
I think you mean DEEPER
03also I want to see what the calculator does with actual greyscale images. Do you have any of your sprite stuff in a similar size?
11You all need to chill with all the hate.
WE MUST PUSH LITTLE STREAM!
03or padded to that size?
brb,gotta eat
9MAXIMUM QUALITY OVERDRIVE
9HASSHIN!
Silverscreen, who is hating?
11Mib_zfd3bu: It was a pun.
oh i get it
i think he was punning, mib_zfd3bu
i'm slow today
03and yeah, that image works
mib_zfd3bu needs food, badly
captain cold?
03cramped but I can see everything XD
9how does it look and sound?
no, wait, that's the flash's guy
alright, cyall guys.
9total quality ranking: 924 Kbps
7Okay.
7And let's see, grayscale..
11what the hell is with all the snow enemies?
cya Dermathil
11wait...is that Aquaman?

cya guys.
so that's... Killer Frost?
03no
03leave it in color
03the program I have can convert it xD
7Okay.
9so really, how does it look? Does it lag? How about the audio?
03it has 3 options, full greyscale, two-bit greyscale, and then pure black and white, which is what I'm using
11No lgag
11lag*
looks golden
11Really good quality
7Hmm, small sprites.
11Audio/video is synched.
9I would stream at this quality all the time
9but many people don't meet the requirements
03but as far as I know, the calculator only supports black and white so I want to try it out XD
lawl, super friends
11requirements?
03alright, let's ese
03*see
9 1 Mbps of download speed

well, just keep that into consideration :P

BATMAN UP.
wb Pegacorn
9guys I'm thinking
Dat robot
9IN SPAAAAAAAAAAACE
dat obvious flash.
9Guys
9I'm going to
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
9test something DEEPER
WUT
9something....
BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW
9REVOLUTIONARY
/me needs the inception button link >.<
9basically going to test the feasibility of running a low-quality stream parallel to this one
9for users with lower bandwidth
I have MASSIVE video speed.
03hm that failed
03it made it look like a shadow. LOL
7How many shades?
7One?
03um
03no
03basically it made 3 black and white images
03eith with different shades
03but the calculator thought it was pure black andw hite for each
7Huh.
03hold on
o-o
Is the stream up? Not loading for me.
Hi, Dari
Hey.
ohai dari
I'm having the same problem
brb, I think it's dinner time for me
9someone check it out
9gonna test PARARELL STREAMS
9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
Is this the right place to ask a help question?
9later on I'm gonna blow this one up in size to match the size of this window
9but yeah
dat face
should we check even if we have fast connections?
9both streams should be up
9the link I just sent
9is the Low Quality stream
9as in you only need .2 Mbps
Quality looks exactly the same on both to me?
Maybe it's because it's not moving.
03that is really bizarre
03I'll make a video maybe
9exactly because of that
9and....playing.
yeah, it's hard to tell
03http://i.imgur.com/cSwgP.jpg
7Okay. o.o
03that's what it looks like with all 3 images loaded
9also consider the low quality stream is a smaller window
7Hmm.
9can you
Eeyup.
9go fullscreen with both?
I see it's lower quality now.
9and tell me how they look
I've got both open.
well it's definitely a noticeable quality change
7Can you adjust the black/white threshold?
fluidity wise, it looks the same
Both work full screen.
though is the HQ one meant to be slightly behind?
9probably it takes time to encode
9but yeah
9this is great
9it equates to higher quality in the main stream
9and an alternative for people who are lagging
Yeah, with higher quality one is further behind.
I tip my hat to you DCD
well done
I suppose I could add a button to the site to switch between high/low quality stream.
9how's the audio quality on the HQ one?
Audio's fine on both.
eh, the static is noticeable
But yeah, static.
other than that it's fine
HUGE static,but fine.
9how about now?
eeyup
That's better.
still thar
ah
it's softer now
The static's only on the HQ one I think?
Less audible,but still there.
/me thinks he's actually behind on the stream
9I think that's due to Stereo Mix
9I MIGHT have to switch to VAC
out of curiosity, are you purposefully pausing it?
because I'm getting sudden pauses occasionally
9in some places, yeah
Mmm... chicken and black bean quesadillas.
9but not now
/me passes around what he had for dinner.
With chipotle cream cheese
hmmm
9guys
9I wish to ask you something
well it seems to happen every 4-5 seconds or so
9current audio quality in the main stream is
9 128 kbps
9I could lower that to 96
9and boost video quality
9would you like that?
The HQ was fine for a while alongside the low quality one with me, but yeah, it now freezes every 4-5 seconds.
9or do you prefer higher-quality audio?
hmmm
03Not sure.'
03I just took a 5 minute video showing what I mean XD
Ohai FreezeFrame.
probably, Polarfire
9probably due to the stress in my net...cause I opened to watch the LQ one
what kind of question?
well, I would say audio assuming the freeze thing is just a glitch that wouldn't happen
Oh lookie!I put a dead Spy on the table!
but if lowering audio fixes the freezing, go with that
Whats this?
/me points at the dead Spy he put on the table earlier
stream is down for me
@Ziltoid DCD is experimenting with stream quality
ok
Now i must find out just who this Spy is.
9lowered audio quality on both
9increased video quality on the main one
/me ponders yet again about it
9tell me your experiencese
9*experiences
Static on HQ one, I closed the low quality one.
what is this?
okay, as far as the HQ goes (accidentally closed the low one)
Ah ok.
The static is more prevalent, BUT the video doesn't freeze
if I had to choose between video and audio, I'd vote video
9roger that, then
.......GODDAMNIT GUYS HELP ME!
You know the annoying meme "(Bleep)ing magnets, how do they work?" I'd like to start my variant of that meme: "(Bleep)ing Windows, why is it (bleep)?"
did you pause it?
9I'll be fixing audio soon
It still freezes for me but a lot less common.
because the freezing is starting up again
9no, I didn't pause it
its buffering for me
then yeah, the freezing seems to be unrelated to audio quality
9gonna lower video quality on the main one
WHY DOES EVERYPONY IGNORE ME?!
Only if you use a version that is 7+ years old
03OK,. uploading.
Pegacorn sorry, but I don't RP
gah I dont know whats going
9lower end of the audio quality spectrum for both
9video reverted on the HQ one
9streaming both at the same time
9testing for fluidity
Necessitating a very annoying reboot.
9how is the HQ one right now?
no freezing- YET
oh
there it is
(Annoying due to the fact that I had to shut down several emulated systems that I am the host of.)
9gonna close the LQ stream
and now it's....gone?
9watch for a minute, and then tell me
lol on a random note
this episode was totally inspired by ME2
9any freezing thus far?
nope
9going to restart the LQ stream
im freezing but my internets bad
9re-streaming the LQ stream as well
9Ziltoid
9test the Low-Quality stream
9http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=BronyStateLowQuality
where?
oh ok
9we're testing for parallel streams, actually
Dat parrallel stream
9any freezing so far?
lq is offline
That sucks
nope
looks good to me
for me anyway
9going offline
9restarting both
To put it lightly... when I reboot my PC I have to:
kk
1. Reboot a MicroVAX 3900 running VMS 7.3.
2. Reboot a VAX 11/780 running an Ultrix variant (can't remember the version).
3. Reboot a PDP-11/70 running RSTS/E 10.1.
4. Reboot a quad processor PDP-11/74 running RSX-11/M+.
9both should be live now
5. Reboot a KS-10 running TOPS-10.
6. Reboot a KL-10 running TOPS-20.
And finally: 7. Reboot a PDP-15/XVM running XVM/RSX.
Skylands ):
9Ziltoid
9LQ should be live now
9go check it out
yeah
I got it
9testing both
9guys, tell me about your experiences with them
will do
9playing
pause within the first second
intentional?
9keep watching and just tell me how it runs
I believe the one I want is setpass but I don't understand the syntax.
I dont buffer on hq
I lmean lq
the command, I mean
No freezing on HQ yet.
bit of static but no big deal
back
(my god, I haven't seen anything like that since Avatar.)
Why do you even have such a setup?
03^
9I think this exam is satisfactory?
heya
yeah, no freezes
like, opening the door meant almost pushing the door in people.
Why not put it all in the startup folder 8D
Freeze.
9roger
On HQ.
haha HML
you sure dari?
it only froze at the beginning for me
9will save these settings
9what are your dl speeds, guys?
Well it just starting freezing for me on HQ too.
Then went offline. O_o
uhh...I have no idea
where can I find out?
9Val, still running for you?
eeyup
According to speedtest.net mine is 10mbps
lq is still up
9http://speedtest.net
Ok, playing again.
Freezing again.
lol
heya
12.39 for me
Hmm
so, anybody see what I type?
Well it froze once.
Yes Dermathil.
whew
Seems to be fine now.
9I do
(Even if it is host to only the enthertubes interface for the 11's and VAXen.)
I do
12Hello drf
(...Speaking of VAXen, I can also get Minecraft server running on one.)
when I first saw this I thought, OMG THEY BROUGHT BACK TEEN TITANS...mfw that wasn't the case
Ok, it's alright now.
9gonna keep this running as a stress test
yeah...I miss Teen Titans
oh
...
just had a pause
again
Then it froze once again.
And agai.
9also ReticentSmolder: this is MUCH better than TT...even if I liked TT
again*
what is this>
freezing
minecraft is useless so why bother? :p
freezing
Offline
OFFLINE
?
9I think I know why
dude, TT was awesome
9give me a moment
9it WAS
9but this is even better
this seems alot more serious then TT
eh...I've yet to be convinced by it
I prefer Justice League imo
lq is offline
well, justice league before the radical artistic change
Well, it makes the VAX do something other then go "I'm in a cluster." :P

Can you not just stream with FME open once, 2 vide bitrates, and the backup URL filled?
9lowered video quality on HQ one SLIGHTLY
for my download speed:
it should be noted I'm running 3 email clients, 3ds Max and Skype
(work related stuff)
9dari: I don't know. I'm using two different instances of FME. I'll look into it
9okay, testing again
anypony here?
9we are
eeyup
9doing quality tests
what cartoon is this?
9Young Justice
9how is it running?
did you pause it?
how is it>
Just froze on HQ
because it was fine until just now
can't make it paly
9FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
9how about now?
doing good
how is the show?
Not freezing at the moment.
Ohai interior_gummy
9it's a pretty good show
oh hi pegacorn
so what show is this?
howdy gummy
oh hi NewDCD
oh hi dari
9Young Justice
oh hi Reticent
heya
oh hi Val
oh he mad
oh hi ziltoid
oh hi doggy
so this is like Justice Leagu meets teen titans?
hi gummy
oh hi mark
oh hi robin
robin...is kind of a weenie here compared to his role in TT
oh hi scientist dude
9no problems yet?
robin is ALWAYS a weeny outside of TT
nopers
ROBIN IS BABY!
(lol Heavy Weapons Guy)
@ValtheJean I think TT was the first series to make Robin look like a badass leader
air vent escape was busted by mythbusters
agreed
9MOTION SENSORS
wait, so now robin has been demoted to tech weenie?
ung...robin's tech in this is just a fancy magic system
9not really
9Robin in this series: The Tactician
9and that is AWESOME
robin=twilight sparkle
I'll need to see more episodes then
9because he's Tim Drake
oh, that's alright I guess, but TT made him a fucking ninja
because this episode isn't doing him justice
9TT Robin was probably Dick Grayson
also, he's totally biting off of ME
9YJ Robin is probably Tim Drake
.....Twilight Sparkle is less of a wimp than Robin.
beast boy was the shit on that show
9Dick: ACROBATICS UP THE ASS, even better in combat than Batman
9Tim: THE TACTICIAN, even smarter than Batman in when it comes to that sort of stuff
in that case, fluttershy=robin?
I CHOOSE YOU PIKACHU
>mfw I have no idea who you've been referencing
oh man
9and quite frankly I prefer Tim!Robin
9a tactician is funner
03LOL
honestly, I think your praise is a little misplaced NewDCD, or at least from what I've seen so far
9and you'll see why in the next battle
he looks like penn jilette
why does it always end with the bad guy drinking/injecting something and turning into a beast?
9since he ain't so dead no more
FOOL! YOU'VE ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD!
Dat floor squeek
TT had this nice style and flow to fights, I'm not sure about these just yet, lots of wide angle posing like Justice League
i thought he was invincible?
Also, since this is Superboy, he gets to use dat Tactile Telekinesis.
I like this Aqualad
wait...so aquaman's son is just a Greenlanturn with water?
Water manipulation powers
yeah, this aqualad is pretty tight, TT's awualad is how most people view Robin
derp
aqua lad was in TT?
man...I really should have finished that series
yeah, he led Titans East
titans...east?
jesus how long did that show last?
I saw like the first two seasons
there was a second team of titans with a different cast of characters that made a few appearances
03ROFL, there's a car part called a Car bra
I knew that long ago
9DEM TACTICS
Also, Aqualad has super strength and some invuln.
03what's it do o.o
that's... beyond me in my current state, sorry
03and sigh, I need to pay $50 to replace my mirrir
dat super strength
03*mirror
9LUNA'S MOON
led by awualad, had max y minos, 2 latin twins who were really fast, but only when in contact with each other, silver arrow, Green Arrow's sidekick or w/e those names are, and...I forget the chick's name
and then he turns into a giant monkey
9Bumblebee I think
wasnt it jinx or something?
yeah, bumblebee
no, Jinx was bad
nvm, jinx was a villain
OH HAI EVERYONE
03oh, the thing that goes over the front?
oh hi doggy
howdy ziltoid
Hal and John
<----------- was totally obsessed with TT and super upset when it got cancelled
IS THAT A CHALLENGE?
hi val
no?
BITCH
Who's the dude with the awesome suit and top hat?
My brother is a B.R.A
battle ready armour
Twisted Fat....haha nah j/k
ahem
anyway
03hm
Only one I don't recognize.
Fate*
03live chat

twisted fat sounds like a villain :P
9oh Supes, y u don't know how to treat your "kid"
batman is not amused
.-.
oh fuck that shit
ewwww......webbed hands
when batman tells you not to
O.o
you bend the fuck over
Wut
and take it
9also Aqualad's the team leader here I think
isn't robin technically a child laborer?
7Well, that video finally finished loading. XD
7And I watched it all the way through.
yes? he doesn't get paid though
*trollface*
03if you're into small images, you should try making calculator pictures :P
9you are now drooling
obligatory female
phffff
hawt
batman is stealthy enough
03I dunno how the program works, it lets you do 6-color greyscale images using 3 2-color pictures, but eh
WTF
wait...WHAT
7Eh, sprites did originate from such limitations. :P

all I can say is: "Bravo good sir"
keep being awesome ;)
well, I bet with 200 bronies on the HQ stream would get bogged down fast
12bbl
I don't think the number matters
9number doesn't matter
because it's his upload speed to our download speed
we just connect to the server he uploads to (if I understand the tech right)
9I stream data to the Veemi servers, which can handle loads on the tens of millions
What are you gunna stream now?

03and well, I'm pretty certain there's a way to forcibly get divorced
03yeah

hello Dermathil
How is that an LOL situation drf? ):
my parents divorced
It also depends on the state
in 2003
my parents married when I was two, divorced when I was five
As its possible that there are different procedures
My parents were married in 2001 but they were together a long time before
But I believe that the consenting one would call a court day, both would appear in court
03<Kosoveon> my parents married when I was two, divorced when I was five <- so in other words they married because they wanted to raise you properly and then realized that wasn't going to work? :P
03I've watched too much TV LOL
03sigh, I need someone who's good at chemistry to explain sigma and pi bonds :/
God no
03yeah see
03I have a final exam tomorrow
03I understand basically everything we've learned
03except that
03I'm going on wikipedia and ym brain hurts
03*my
I think I saw those in my textbook, we never covered them
Reading Witch of the Westmareland now
03lucky
But they looked like they hurt
03yep
Because medieval folk tales + MLP is a recipe for win.
03legit

I can't think of a single Tennant episode I don't love though.
NOoooooooooooo
/me sighs
13Three if you include me :B
03LOL k
I liked the no-companion extra-length specials
03still a surprising minority
Waters of Mars was creepy. Especially the end.
^
OH SNAP
I loved that one.
Waters of mars were awesome.
10o.O
Haven't watched that one yet
It's a good one.
I loved the Oods episodes
03he probably deleted his account
7^
It's a great character moment for the Doctor
Fail
Oh yea.h
10Reason?
7Anyway:
And the ood ones.
I wonder why
03Who knows
03does it even matter?
those were awesome.
10That's what I am looking for
Nah, he sucked
:p
10Duh, guest = deleted account
7My disconnect was because of one of my parent's attempt to get the other to focus on their dilemma.
13Wait, what?
03Yeah but I mean, does it matter why he left?
10Yes
10Without giving reason
I'm only up to the fifth Tennant episode i think
10Makes me very curious
I'm completely caught up on new Who
Tennant <3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
03I never give reasons when I fill out forms LOL
LAAAAAAAAWL
03it's like "please tell us why you uninstalled our software" NOPE
he's one of my favorite doctors
and i only know like 3
I'm going to try to Cosplay as him for Halloween
7It was on the leaving/returning thread.
7No, it's the router. :P
I'm too pudgy to pass as any doctor
7I have my own computer.
neat
03they unplugged the router?
7Yep.
03fail LOL
03My parents don't even know how to do that
/me hides
Though if I were skinnier, my ears and nose are big enough to pass for Nine
7Hmm.
7Don't know when that parent will re-disconnect it...
7But what'd I miss when I did?
Anyone here watch Primeval?
Watched it
I never got into it.
03you could always be a ninja and cut them both off, steal the one modem plug for your computer :P
Primeval, wilhelm screams. XD
I loved Primeval before it was cancelled
Used so much.
Back when my hair was longer, I thought about obtaining a pink gi and going as Dan Hibiki for Halloween
It had SO MUCH POTENTIAL
OYAJI!
I was pissed of when Cutter died.
off*
7o.O
7Now, I don't know how that works. :P
03LOL
03You plug the Ethernet cable into your computer

03my mom sits next to the router every day and doesn't realize it
03well then pick the laptop up and move it closer to the modem LOL
7It's a desktop. :U
03oh
03I thought you said you had a laptop o.o
7Well, I use one.
Ohai mordekaizer.
7But it's not 'my' computer.

7I feel kinda iffy for complaining about my personal problems, but I'm asking for ways to just get it over with rather than hearing complaints that have lasted for three years. :U
it ain't foreshadowing if it has already happened
But timewise it hasn't. :P
yeah
Three years O.o
Shoot da whoop

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
He would've made a great companion.
yeah
I feel the need to do a reading of Witch of the Westmareland.
I wish jackie wasnt a cunt all the time
you feel the need to read all of Past Sins to us
She lightens up
Not for Eccleston, but she lightens up for Tennant
well sort of
yeah
She prefers Tennant a great lot.
I still dont like her
/me surprise-glomps his secret-identities waifu
hai rainbrodash
Ohai Silvermare
I think Donna is the best simply because she's so funny. XD
silvermare?
tennant is so good everyone prefers being around him!
For some reason I don't even really remember/think of Amy when I think of the Doctor's companions.
Fuck yeah. Full-screen brony state streaming on my TV.
amys cool
It must be because I associate her with Smith.
03frick, I think I screwed up my sitsers' computer
Why do you hate smith so much?
SMITH IS A PRICK
I like Rory because he's the only companion who doesn't freak out about the "Bigger on the inside than the outside" thing.
I don't think he can act and he took the job of someone who could have been an awesome Doctor.
If only I still have my hi-def.
lol
Rory is fucking baws
River Song is fucking baws.
Best character in Doctor Who at the moment.
that too
I WATCH FOR HER

What happened now .x.
>fly the TARDIS better than the Doctor himself

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Seems to be based off Warriors
You cry
ATI
ATI :D
Can it power cities?
it is in fact the greatest and most powerful thing ever, only TGAP Trixie is more powerful
ATI is better for number crunching & value for munnies
specifically, OpenCL stuff
derp
Wow... I was a better writer at 12
lawl the mares
03yeah
7Brb.
03ATI is only better for that
