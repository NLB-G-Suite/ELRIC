6holy
6crap
hi guys
03XD
6I never once had reason to hate, but now i do
06iMac, Macbook = Hard and frustrating to use
6I only upgraded cuz D3 needs it
Fizzle.
6this is horrible
06any Apple mobile devices: user freindly
11,01Meanwhile: Lol.
06lol
lol
WHY DO I REMEMBER THE NAME
lol
6I don't want to really
XD
03Lighty, I disagree, the iPod Touch is really retarded but I mayaswell jailbreak the one I have
6it's unstable, I use it primarily for other things
03so it'll be worth more if I sell it
03XD
03well
cause you would be a bad parent if you didn't
dddddddddddaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwww
6I can't repartition without backing everything up and wiping it
6which is way more work than necessary
06not retarded at all, maybe you are retarded for judging too quickly, and not using a PROPER one x3
someone say mac OS?
/me flees
03Lighty, there's all of like two things you can actually do with iOS
Good times, good times
Awwww
Fnl.
6drf may be a lot of things
03Android lets you do a WHOLE lot more
Fml*
6retarded when it comes to technology
:3
06iOS does the same lol
STOP SHIPPING ME DAMMIT!
06maybe more
asdfmovie2
03not really.
06but, >More Userfreindly<
11,01Stop shipping.
By making it both shipping and French, I make the transition easier.
so...doesnt look like I missed much then?
oh decent vpn support
where are you
not on iOS
6I'm just gonna say this before the debate goes on longer
03Lighty, Apple's whole philosophy is to hide functionality from the user in order to make it "more friendly"
03but >less functionality
6everyone has preferences, some people are more accustomed to other OSes
lol user friendly iphones
O_O
I had no clue how to operate the thing when I got mine at first
um......
I know you can press the screen and slide and swipe but that was it
That's how we do it on the beach mofo.
Naww, I got pizza sauce on me...
6so saying one or the other is pretty stupid
06goodnight :P
02iOS isn’t friendly or open to developers
