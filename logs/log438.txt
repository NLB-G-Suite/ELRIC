Invi: you could avert WW3 with bacon
Acleps: My mom is pretty nice. She use to be mean and stuff but I think she's improving. :) So I think I'll do this. Besides the sooner the better. I'm gonna try to make it look like a accident like I didn't realise she was home and I was watching MLP an the computer
maybe not toothpaste and bacon....
Acleps: before i was a brony i think i got mcdonalds applejack......... now i regret all the things i said to her :( h god why

Dashie_Dashie: maybe

Everypony...probably should leave SlurryMoon 's family out of this :P might be irritating
brother wants to play Master Tetris
SlurryMoon: sure u do <_< >_>
Ponies47: Well, that way you can be prepared to explain the show without making it sound strange that you watch it. I think your mom won't dissaprove you watching the show: she's still your mom. I wish you luck! :)
I'm messing with ya SlurryMoon. :)

PrincessLuna, downing whiskey is a bad idea. Unless you want to have a permanent duck face.
/me turns Pinkies4thWall into a potato

my internet speed is finally un-shittified so now i can actually watch the stream
03Lighty, I disagree, the iPod Touch is really retarded but I mayaswell jailbreak the one I have
6it's unstable, I use it primarily for other things
GOD they got balls
03so it'll be worth more if I sell it
03XD
03well
03want Windows 7? :P
cause you would be a bad parent if you didn't
6it's already partitioned at a small amount
GilDash: Everyone is funny when "flustered"
otakon x balls
IshBestSeapony FUUUUUUUUUUu
GilDash: So, I'm an egg now? :d
dddddddddddaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwww
6I can't repartition without backing everything up and wiping it
dat snow mongooze
A snow mongoose!
Wild Snow Mongosse
6which is way more work than necessary
06not retarded at all, maybe you are retarded for judging too quickly, and not using a PROPER one x3
someone say mac OS?
/me flees
03Lighty, there's all of like two things you can actually do with iOS
Good times, good times
Awwww
Fnl.
6drf may be a lot of things
03Android lets you do a WHOLE lot more
Fml*
6retarded when it comes to technology
Pele playing David Bowie
otakon X good times

06iOS does the same lol
STOP SHIPPING ME DAMMIT!
06maybe more
asdfmovie2
kitteh
Meanwhile, otakon is learning to ignore the shipping, so call him french.
/me puts the wild snow mongoose babies in her mane
03not really.
03also Aurora what
otakon x baguettes.
06but, >More Userfreindly<
RX-78-SweetieBot: I AM NOT FRENCH!
Ponies47: ur lucky me and PrincessLuna a good friends now
11,01Stop shipping.
By making it both shipping and French, I make the transition easier.
so...doesnt look like I missed much then?
oh decent vpn support
Meanwhile: yfw I LOVE baguettes with butter.
where are you
Otakon is so very french
not on iOS
6I'm just gonna say this before the debate goes on longer
otakon: Oh I know right.
03Lighty, Apple's whole philosophy is to hide functionality from the user in order to make it "more friendly"
otakon x French
03but >less functionality
Omnomnom.
6everyone has preferences, some people are more accustomed to other OSes
/me packages otakon and sends to UPS
3I love this stop motion :3

I'm good friends with you both Shane377 Ponies47 !
Sugar crabs?

That's how we do it on the beach mofo.
Naww, I got pizza sauce on me...
06i gotta go for bed now, and you're lucky that im tired, im not in the mood for a pointless discussion with hypocrites and unpure minded retards
6so saying one or the other is pretty stupid
Om: ... Does that mean you're not flustered? You're getting very hard to read Ommy...
06goodnight :P
02iOS isn’t friendly or open to developers
SlurryMoon: me too man, me too.

03Apple actually removed an app from their app store just because it said "Android" in the description >_>
Dat french

Oh hey it's otakon.
Om: But it tastes so good!
02LOL
/me licks Om clean.
03it was one of those "Download the app for iOS or Android"
03and they were like no, gtfo

06alright, nini
Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo

SlurryMoon: No updated desktop ponies ? :o
Nittany_Discord of course for tommorow you chose the wall
3never got around to downloading the new ones
03I'm far too nice though
SlurryMoon: oh well that's okay.

03I'm used to dealing with people like him LOL
are you sure? i heard on good authority you are now french
SlurryMoon: ponies :(
11,01You have to download Seapony Lyra separately.
6should rephrase
SlurryMoon: i understand
6you probably /should/
shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
Well, I be out, gonna go pla yGMOD.

6I need to move to the other one
Om: Right, Ommy?
Seapony Lyra is part of the Original Character pack, right?
I really like her... hairdo?
GilDash: What?
Nittany_Discord you would not stop talking about the wall when the lottery turned up shaun of the dead and diehard
/me snuggles with Om.
Stop that.
034. YOUR PS3 WAS JAILBREAKED!!! <- LOL Engrish hackers
yeah he is I agree on that
Nittany_Discord so you download desktop ponies just to download seprate desktop ponies...seems legit
02Apple fanboy
11,01No.
and honestly this community nowadays...
03hey, aren't I usually a nice guy too? It's just when your opinion gets threatened that you turn into a jerk :P
03I try not to
03can't speak for others
REJECTION!
/me seperates GilDash from Om
Is the Wall that good of a movie?
Om: Can't hear you, mucky pup.
11,01The Seapony Lyra pony won't work without the main executable included in the base desktop ponies file.
6don't make me start
/me tickles PrincessLuna
Hmm
<Lighty> "Right of Free Speech =/= Right to be an arse" <- considering the situation this was hilariously ironically said.
/me rolls
11,01Also, I use the main desktop ponies.
Om: lol just accept it. :D
6espeon, that was my thought exactly
PrincessLuna: ever get moar wine?
Nittany_Discord i think you broke my brain
Nittany_Discord: have u realised that that spike is in the pet section?
??? Muck Pup?
as he basically you know, did that. also the "lol lets say something bad before i leave as people might forget about it"
WallDives: Of course!
6at first I thought someone else had said it cuz of how it was worded
yay, me too!
I'll talk to him whenever I see him tbh
/me laughs at Shane377 's tickling
Om: You, slipping pizza all down yourself. Mucky... pup... ;)
03it's fun to watch people ragequit :P

03that I'm hoping works

NiS, i have heard numerous arguments for "we should go easy on him because of his age" AND "age is not an escuse to behave like an a$$"
GilDash: I just won't say anything anymore.

I don't know if I love or hate this movie.
go easy on him because of his age hah no
Om: Sorry!
I just can't decide.
as he's really really proud of being so mature for his age and such
02I never said you should
his own words btw
03yeah I remember that Espeon
XD
02oh
I just brought up Sea Pony Lyra on my own computer. Yes, it's the same set of assets.
PrincessLuna: Hugs don't make it better >>
Captain Henesse...nice
and he usually actually does act more mature than I'd expect a 14yo to do
PrincessLuna: did u see the link i pinged u in
Om: Of course they do!
Shane377: Of course! xD
/me hugs Om.
so my guess is that he had a bad day or something, still not acceptable what he did tho
Om: Hugs make everything better. :)
ur so cute in that
Lol
xD
If hugs don't make it better, some one is doing it wrong.

Call upon the seaponies when you lose the game
6I can potentially take a guess
Blowdown you should meet her. she is really friendly.
6considering how depressed you sound
07coward: noun. Cows that are awkward
07fits Silvespeon completely
13LOL
/me 11,01calls upon IshBestSeapony

Shoo be doo
Shoo shoo be doo
I could also guess
The sea ponies!
Nittany_Discord yes my puppet
My desktop Pinkie Pie just walked up to onscreen Octavia and said "you really need to get out more"
Barbetos: she should call me on skype!
11,01Swim.
These things are sentient, I swear.
Barbetos: for shits and giggles
/me shoots IshBestSeapony before she could be called upon
03yeah nvm
Nittany_Discord: I don't get what the game is about o_o

Meanwhile: :D

daring luna?
It was wine before ;)
11,01Gunthler: The Game?
Yo ho ho a pairates life for me!
PrincessLuna: Be sure to pass some here. ;)

In that case yes, its a stream of it.
otakon: a little more scared of you know

（￣へ￣）
Maid_Discord: I can hear you!
EEEYUP

otakon, You have a rape shed?
Yes I can hear you
TheGir979 never gonna happen
You French are crazy
otakon: BronyCon the Documentary.
LunaTheBeloved: I don't!
What a wonderful day for Canadah
Can you get some stuff out of the way?
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved "I don't dammit!"
i hear a voice, but it's hard to understand, cuz it's quiet and quality seems to be bad Maid_Discord
otakon: .15 cubic feet -_-
/me hugs otakon "Sure you don't..."
kenne: it's mostly for cash and games man.
07but you asked for dolphin =P
Lol dat weird noise
Ugh...I've got to debug a 1900 LOC Program. It's a nightmare.
kenne: search around for a bigger one
i asked for a dolphin... face
otakon, you crazy french with your ships and your locks
not an entire dolphin
phobos2390: good luck
LunaTheBeloved: http://www.fimfiction.net/story/25740/The-Force-of-Friendship-%28Family%29 new chapter
Dken2021: I AM TRYING TO HELP OUT kenne dammit!
otakon: i dont think you could fit more than 4 or 5 cases in there
Is Maid_Discord afk?
arggg
otakon: Dis thing: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/257527888/bronycon-the-documentary
otakon: do you have experience with collision detection software?
Marx: Mind sending me another link to the livestream? I had to switch computers and lost it :(
Bronysith, I saw, I'm just gonna read it tomorrow, I'd just like to relax and not really do anything tonight
kenne: well you could get something bigger or just use paper sleeves and put the discs in them.
Kandarihu, Idk
a face
phobos2390: sorry man I do not.
For me being new on here I just wanted to ask...who is your favourite Pony?
that is one line
otakon: and if a safe that is .15 cubicc feet is 20$... T_T
SunderlandPony89: hiya! how are you?
yay dolphins~ :3
DJ PON-3
okay LunaTheBeloved
LittleBrony I kinda like Rarity
LittleBrony: Fluttershy :[
otakon: Pretty good. Sick, but good other that that
phobos2390: Fluttershy is a boss
/me explodes
kenne: dude, what can I say? it's either that or threaten your brother and his friends with viable bodily harm to dissaude them from taking your stuff illegaly
otakon: lol
/me sweeps up Midnight_Tempest into a neat pile
otakon: dem fancy words otakon
One donation of $10k, two of $2.5k, three at $1k....good god, where did people produce that kind of money? ._.
hey everypony!
oooh... bodily harm? i got just the tools for that
I freaking hate Mr. Garrison.
Maid_Discord: just barely, I think your volume settings for the mike are off I think
Hahaha.
lol
Midnight_Tempest: kenne's brother's friends apparently took some stuff from kenne's room. And his parents apparently can't do anything about it.
Hey AJTheMightyGamer
Get me back in my body!
hiya AJTheMightyGamer
lol
WUT
XD
O_______________O logic
Another question only some will get, has anyone here every trolled true capitalist radio before?
+14, -1, +25
XD
no
true capitalist radio?
LittleBrony: Nope
KENNEH
I thought Ghost gave up… being what he was before.
10g'night bronystaters, gonna play some SC2 and go to bed :3
<( ' v )=>
otakon: then all he kenne needs to do is take the stuff back and if his bro and friends try to do it again, hurt them... severely with a bat or large hammer... nothing says 'Dont Touch my Shit' like a few broken fingers
Night RainBroDash
My dolphin.
03LOL what.
hai RainBroDash, bai RainBroDash
Oh
I thought it was...
KILL JOHN LENNING
seeya RainBroDash
Nevermind
First part is head
lol
03LOL
SunderlandPony89: Oh well I didn,t expect anyone to know what that is anyway.
Last part is tail
Lol Butters is awesome
asdfmovie
It looks like a fat bird
He's already dead TheGir979
:3
..........
LittleBrony: Listened to recordings and I've watched a show or two live, but that's it.
otakon: thing is i dont know which one of them took it or even currently has it
Who is this imposter Cypresswolf & why do they only show up when I refresh after chat crashes? O_o
night RainBroDash
CriticKitten: Ghost is an asshole but we got to love and tolerate...
LOL Butters can't kill him anyway then
what was taken kenne?
well that was meant for Midnight_Tempest but i guess it works both ways
Cypresswolf|: it's caht derpying on you.
IT'S A SPAI Cypresswolf|
Midnight_Tempest: a bunch of my games
mah mah mah
go to the hub website...oops
eh
Midnight_Tempest: especially the ones i got for my birthday
never mind
LittleBrony: Ghost's hilarious is what he is. Dude's obviously playing to his crowd and that's why it's become a "thing".
who's ghost?
:) be right back
CriticKitten: Of course but what I don't understand is how he makes the can noise.
I want to see the portal 2 campaign
Actually
Dken2021: He's the host of an internet radio show who's infamous for being trolled in a segment where people can say whatever they want on the show for a few seconds
kenne: hmm... the problem here is your parents apparently dont give a shit, so you have to make them give a shit or take matters into your own hands... violence is honestly never the answer, but it helps you get to the answer faster sometimes
03OK, so ... what
Dken2021: Ghost is a raido host who hates bronies.
03apparently Autodesk owns Pixlr?
THE TALE OF SCROTIE MCBOOGERBALLS
<( ' v )=<
03at least the Android app
MYAH! At last I've taken over Cypresswolf's computer *twists mustache*
TheGir979: that's old! Old ep is old
LittleBrony: I imagine he's got a sound byte.
Darkts33: He calls us 'over feminized fruit bowls'
SunderlandPony89 you think being trolled all the time he'd be aware of it by now
03>pre-order Halo 4
03seriously?
03Halo 4?
That makes it less fat :o
Midnight_Tempest: lol, i really am thinking about it even though im the quietest and friendliest person youll ever meet, i have a lot of pent up agression over the years from all the bullshit ive ever taken
Dken2021: He probably is. I'd be surprised if his reactions were geniune and not just him going along with being trolled to get viewers
It's from 2010... It's not THAT old. Not as old as Cartman Gets An Anal Probe
hi
kenne: You're a fluttershy eh? :[
I SHOULD OF NEVER GONE ZIPLINING
<( ' v ' )>
SunderlandPony89: He's playing along for sure.
What's this? Whiskey? :D *evil laugh* He won't be needing this *smashes bottle*
ehh
Front face view of a dolphin
phobos2390: i guess thats why i like fluttershy so much :I
good enough :D
That's partially why it's so funny. The trolls get so damn creative with their trolling.
For example, you say moo to kenne and he gets irritated
/me hides
Isn't flutter shy a peaceful pony? Then again I am not even on episode 20 of season 1 yet...
<=( ^ v ^ )=>
kenne: you could also take some of your brothers things and use it as leverage to get your stuff back... or if you really feel like being a jerk to them, and know that it was your bro's friends that took them, call the cops on them... theft is theft, no matter how small
Hm
why do the fins have = signs?
So I log in hoping I haven't been missing anything good, and lo and behold, they're streaming Portal 2...
Since < > makes the dolphin have very small fins
= extends it
i suppose
YOU'RE. GOING. TO. LOVE ME!!!!
kenne: Saying moo to you gets you irritated?
i ponder how it would look like without = signs though
Midnight_Tempest: well i know if i take his shit hell take mine, and im pretty sure you cant prosecute someone if you have no proof they commited the crime
theGir979: :[
< ( ^ v ^ ) >
oh
Dead chat is dead
phobos2390: -_-
So...hello, everypony. Who is streaming this most excellent game?
That looks better
don't sie!
Ugh :| These desktop ponies...Applejack can go...Scootaloo can go...They ALL can go - psycho Twilight & Pinkamena are clearly best ponies - 10 copies each! :D
*die
hello Reikim
otakon: Hello!
Hi Reikim

1,14o8°4o
Sandvhci needs to make chat better num num num
Sky's dolphin doesn't like to smile. :c
<-( ^ v ^ )->
So this chat appears...well, dead.
kenne: then your best option is just to kick some people's asses until you get your shit back... honestly, if i lived near you i would lend you my tonfas... that would solve the problem, very fast
Noooo internet, dont die on me
so moist and delicious
:) I hear Cypress coming back...:) Bye Everypony *Evil Laugh*
03but dolphins don't smile
/me runs
Jet, yeah it does?
So who's streaming?
Midnight_Tempest: that plus i dont know if i actually have the guts to call the police... i have real problem with talking to people
03also why are we making dolphins

^ ^ are happy eyes
Reikim: Nittany(Maid)_Discord is

v is the snout
Midnight_Tempest: Um. Love and Tolerance?
GNNIGHT EVERYPONYH and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL
it's better than making TF2 characters
Midnight_Tempest: i guess thats why i didnt really talk at all the first time i met otakon
Night Bronysith
Or beak, like ^v^ bird
now now, let's not begin pulling knives on folks lol
Bronysith: May the ponies be with you :d
Reikim: That's only toward poni haters. Everyone else is fair game
Oh lol
<-( * (') * )->
;o
/me begins an autopsy on the dead chat
Reikim: love and tolerance can only go so far, steal mine or someone elses shit and i lay a smack down on some bitches
.
Bronysith: Gnight dude
weird
what is
nevermind
gnight Bronysith
I SEE THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH Bronysith. Night!
Ty for all the Gnights. now I must go... Molestia is waiting for me

Lucky bastard

same with minecraft
hi TheGir979

Midnight_Tempest: im pretty sure he can tell you that himself
Hi TheGir979
I'm using the mouse of a graphics tablet. It's somewhat awkward
Atlas and P.Body
Theoretically I suppose I could kick ass, but I'd never feel very good about it...
phobos2390 well any game is awful if you use the track pad on a laptop
Psycho Twilight is psycho
So...what happend with Derpy being in the show?
/me slowly backs away
/me throws a dictionary at TheGir979
Hm. Appears to be a hemmorhage in th ebrain.
0_o
LittleBrony she's still the same derpy we know and love
kenne: you just need to let out the anger... just let it flow and show people you wont be walked over... or they will just keep taking your shit and you'll be a doormat forever, trust me... i know this feeling
O_O psycho ponies everywhere - What happened?
Stay back you crazy mare!
Dken2021 any First person/3d game.
