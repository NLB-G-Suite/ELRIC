Sammiver i don't know sorry
And I'm back and grumpy as hell. >_>
alexxm: was about 100, sent them a text with the number they shared back in march 2 days ago - first time I used it - trying to reserve judgement until they do respond, cause maybe something did happen, but it isnt easy keeping my temper in check after 6 months of no results
but i can still hear things and i have this game so i should know whats happening because i know the sound effects pretty well
hia
Tried to nap. But despite being tired I couldn't sleep at all. Finally gave up. >_<

/me zooms in on brony_boy115 with vats
(status meeting is postponed because only like 2/3rds of us are here at work...
/me explodes brony_boy115 s body with bloody mess
Bronysith I hate RPGs with Skill systhems like Elder Scrools, Fallout and such, I just like to have a game with a good story and action
)
damn, missed you playing tf2
00,02i'd like to note that the new version of paintchat i pushed is damn near the same as the old one
FALLOUT 3>ELDER SCROLLS
Skyrim is over simplified compaired to the other elder scrolls games.
Lil_B: understandable
00,02except
00,02when shit breaks
Phase4: whats teh panit chat for? xD
/me come back to life as a Allicorn

00,02whoops
PonyNegZero: there is no complexity in skyrim
PonyNegZero I like Skyrim but I get bored of it easily its so simplistic.
00,02der we go
Bronysith: yes there was, one example was the supply/demand system
00,02dat giant blue window
00,02thats the change
00,02it yells at you if it breaks
PonyNegZero: so many arrows so little guards
That's always a good sign
00,02this is a mark improvment over the old version where it silently broke
00,02if you guys see these, take a screenshot and send it to me
deus ex>skyrim
i don't trust blue screens
Maybe I'll go back to playing Morrowind. I miss my spears and crossbows and levitation spells.
/me shoots blue screen
FairysHuff: i hope morrowind goes on sale on steam summer sun celebration sale
http://trollfacecomic.com/post/25093828638
Bronysith I already have the set on disc.
FairysHuff: i hope it goes on sale though
Bronysith Try GOG.com maybe they have it there for cheaper
FairysHuff: nah. i like supporting steams summer sun celebration sale
Bronysith I always check GOG first now. No DRM.
00,02i'm partial toward steam
Patrician III > every other Trading Simulator
00,02handles everything for me
FairysHuff: oooh. indigo prophecy
Phase4 I use both. But if I can get a game DRM free on GOG then I will get it there
When is Steam for Linux supposed to come out again?
Bronysith Yups. They have lots.
Lil_B Never
i wounder why my sai is derping so hard maybe i should not bind it in steam hmmm

00,02VioletGreySha|Drawin, dont know

+phase4 :'( are you gonna stream more later?
Phase4 Yeh I expected that. Bethesda probably have a deal with Valve.
FairysHuff they never said anything about Haldf life 3
(Once Phase4 goes to bed, I might be able to get some work done...)
00,02XD
FairysHuff its just tha fans that constanly mumbling about it
00,02huh
00,02steam.com was taken by ;former home of Steam Tunnel Operations.'

Sammiver: Wrong coffee, then. You should try a mocha instead.
Maybe a cappuccino.
HazelNut Latte for me.
Morning everyone.
Sammiver: did it leave you with *sunglasses* a bad taste in your mouth?
That sounds so good.
I like my coffe like I like my women: Black, strong, and with a spoon in it.
Jim: wat
/me plays Halo reach for to seconds
Jim but how do you get a strong woman
alexxm Genetic engineering
i still think someone should play Amnesia: The dark descent on the stream
I like my women like I like my ale: Not in the least.
brbr foodz
Oh. Right. Coffee.

I have a thing for red heads. Though I've noticed they tend to be bitches. I'd prefer someone like Fluttershy or Twilight Sparkle.

Frankly, I'd rather that either white people were allowed to use that word or nobody at all. The second option is simply censorship, so I guess the first option is the only choice.
This song isn't bad :P
00,03Typical hiphop music, eh?

Although it is still a negative word.
Kinda ironic

Vordox, he's not tryin' to be funny. Just angry
Vordox: I don't know, but I'd be willing to bet you'll avoid him if you don't look for Minecraft LPs.
PewDiePie is superior master race

StinkomanFan: He's trying to be funny via that, though.
sonicandmario85: Weird, Pew usually comments on Nova

PewDiePie/PinKiePie?
We fought so hard now can we understand~!
Mare!
now lets see SuperBrony64 stream him playing this on Guitar Hero
i love this song /)^3^(\
I wonder what percentage of people playing Discord on rock band know the origns of taht song.
Cutie mark crusader drug lords yaaaaay.
Isn't the tone for this a little lower?
Isn't this song supposed to be IMPOSSIBLE on Guitar Hero?
TheRandomkid321: I for one do
i can play this on expert but damn did it take a lot of practive
CK|Basara: Probably
TheRandomkid321: Most of them, because let's face it, who aside from bronies would want to download it?
and even then i can only get a C
Wut, Dragonforce? :D
TheRandomkid321, maybe we'll get more into the herd because of that song?
Epic ending
Meanwhile: Dont fuck with me you little cocharaoch!
CK|Basara: you have no idea
I can play this on expert... just play random notes.
the hay
Dat end
I seem to recall that some game featured this song and was essentially impossible to perfect on.
nice
yay!
OH GO
:O
YEAH!
OH MAI GOD
fuck yeah
:O
Yay ;D
OVERRATEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
ScootaChicken: People who like epic music probably
CrimsonPhoenix: It's spread MLP FIM interest
CrimsonPhoenix: no its not
:O:O:O:O:O
my only question is why are dragonforce songs so bucking long
is the real eurobeat brony singing this?
PUT UP THE ORIGINAL D:<
Rainbow: Eh, I've heard better.
Wait...YOU CAN SING TO THIS?!?!?!
This is actually on Rockband...
FlareChaser|TF2: So word on the street is you want me to...what was it. "Shut my bucking mouth?"
Team rocket shirt? and Jessie- Hair?
Vordox: I can!
sagas I'm not saying it's horrible
Meanwhile: Oh, who told you that?~
Meanwhile: Shit's goin' down
o-o-o-o-o--ooo-o-o-
well now we just need Sister hate and rock band 3 is mine
WHY IS IT LAGGING
MadSurge: this version is the one that actually made it onto the rockband store
I am lipsycing to this
GOD DAMIT
I would rock at singing this. I am the best at singing this out of all the bronys in my class... AKA me.
FlareChaser|TF2: Don't pussy out now boy, grow a spine.
but this being "the best piece of the fandom" is something I cannot agree on
wy would you ban him like come on
imagine singing this ooo-o-o-o-oooo-oooo
I heard that this was an MLP related song, the video from what I saw had nothing to do with MLP
That lady has a man's voice
i know he was anoyying but wy ban
Meanwhile: Actually, I'd rather not get involved right now.
Xaiden Probablyt he fan made video.
cow334: Ban who?
FlareChaser|TF2: So you'd rather not get involved telling me to shut my fucking mouth when I can actually hear you. Figures.
uh oh someones in trouble
also goddamn you're singing computer enhanced vocal
The guitarist's having a siezure...
killerpony7733: from what I'm hearing some one got banned
UGHH why is my thing so buggy?

wait fail on me
00,03This is... torture.
um this song sounds impossible to perform with normal human speech
CrimsonPhoenix: for every theorie there is always someone disagreeing. som people say it is and some don't. the point is we got it on there
I am on the wrong channel
I thinka nyoen would pass out at this part.
lawl
discords been messing with the video
Scoot-Scootaloo: In what way?
ITS MADE VIA COMPUTER!
Scoot-Scootaloo: How come?
cow334: Well i don't know who so meh
What the hell happened to the days when anger in this chat was non-existant :'(
I like the original version form Eurobeat more :) I kinda have an Affinity to these Eurodance-Remixes from eurobeat Brony
I just noticed that the singer looks like Dawn
Also, the Bassist is... JAMES!?
after about the 5 oooooooo i would fail
RaveBrony: i know right
RaveBrony: Oh, the good old days~
RaveBrony: I don't know...
I didn't know James could rock a Bass!
FlareChaser|TF2: So I heard you're looking for traitors.
RaveBrony: Hm?
00,03I kinda like the song, but not for this game. It just doesn't fit
Scoot-Scootaloo, I'm with you
Meanwhile: So I heard I can use /ignore...
Scoot-Scootaloo: Yeah...
I wanna hear the original Discord now...
and who the hell sang that
BRB
Now we neeD NIGHTMARE NIGHT!
Lil_B: I like both versions, but the original is more final boss-like :D
scoot-scootaloo: its a game about music.
Scoot-Scootaloo: do you know if he gets a cut for each copy sold?
Scoot-Scootaloo, we might get more members to the Herd because of this though
FlareChaser|TF2: About time you showed some brain cells. Too bad you're still a coward.
PonyNegZero: i'm sure he does
I don't want to be apart of this right now, I just woke up.
killerpony7733: People are mad in this chat pretty much evey day now :(
Hey FlareChaser|TF2, tell Irish_Pony that I love him back.
Scoot-Scootaloo Yeah its made by computers so :/ but CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! I WANT A FLUTTERHSY SHAPED CAKE AT MY FUNERAL!
MirrorImage: I really hope so

StinkomanFan He can't. First his target needs to have braincells to begin with.
The most child-friendly show in mankind
StinkomanFan: Except if I nailed the shot it'd be more like blowing cobwebs over the map.
killerpony7733: Oh, but yeah, it does :\

In the end: Love and Tolerate in the fandom: bullcrap.

Dear Princess Celestia, today i learned the value and importance of love and tolerance and how much of a positive impact it can have on you and the people around you. Even if it hard some times love and tolerating is the best thing to do. Just because some one is being mean or even rude doesn't mean that you should be mean or rude back to them. Friendship IS magic.
Barbetos|Artwork how'd i do that

that sandwich must have smelled good
So much WW2 this week has been XD
why are we watching a cartoon with nazis in them?
dat duck face
I can't imagine this video elevated to Rickroll status. Rickroll was based on a catchy song. It's WORTH tricking people into watching it. This isn't worth it so much
Yay classic
This is so great :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: a higher res 40s cartoon? -_- Scoot-Scootaloo
yay
Scoot-Scootaloo: already found it :P
Oh, you want me to get you a link? gimme a sec
00,03PM me the link
Still ait's funny
synth strings
I like this song til the end where it gets really preachy
Yeah, but it kinda made the nazi party apetizing
:)
Disney made reall ok Propaganda Videos that Prtraied the Situation in germany accuratly, Warner Brothers and even Dr Suess made some too, but they were insulting
Lightning-Quill: actualy if you see the entire thing is quite hilarious,donald basicly loses it at a bullet making factory
this animation video is goon Oo
Can we watch the disney PSA about mosquitos and pouring oil in bodies of water?
As the Nostalgia Critic would say: in all those years, you've never seen him in the stinkin' Navy! He was in the Army a few times, the boy scouts, even a FUCKING NAZI! How the Hell did that happen? But, never in the Navy.
XD Dark92Enigma
Dark92Enigma: actualy he was in the navy in the "ducktales "show...i remember
"Ducktail the dragnet".....what does that MEAN?
Scoot-Scootaloo: can we watch the disney psa about mosquitos and pouring oil in bodies of water?
Dark92Enigma he was in the navi in Ducktales in one or 2 episodes...
he was in a navy outfit in duck tales iirc
00,03...wut?
Scoot-Scootaloo whats this video, its really good
hungry and lazy not a good mixture
sergio_scriptor Lil_B yes, that quote is actually from his Ducktales review
i never saw donald duck in the air force
you can all thank me for this :3
00,03PMV | Dear Princess Celestia
Irish_Pony: Danke
Scoot-Scootaloo thanks
One of these days I wanna see someone write a song out of pure gibberish, with absolutely no words, and see if it gets popular.
air force didn't exist until air was invented in the 1940s
Irish_Pony thanks a lot
so is there a reason donald's in the german army?
Dken2021 no idea
I wish I had a higher resolution. I can't fit X-Chat, the video, and Tribes Ascend in the same video.
Dken2021, just wait until the end
Tovler: Thank you facts sphere
the only dictactor i heil to is the portuguese dictactor "Salazar" the nicest dictator from world war 2

Lil_B sergio_scriptor the point is, we never seen him in the navy BEFORE Ducktales

Hey, how is everypony doing?

Yes, The Nostalgia Critic ALREADY reviewed Ductales! LOOK IT UP

GarrettBrony: thats what ive discovered in my experience anyway
Vordox, I'd like to apologize for being disrespectful of your free speech. I told you what not to say and that is absolutely unforgivable.
Sundaysmile: I cant find it
It's fine Kandarihu, not everyone can agree to all
It's not fine

I like trains.
Kandarihu: I appreciate you feel respond to what I say, but I rather be a arsehole then a person who lies and smiles all day long
Avenger: I HATE trains :|!
Kandarihu: You deny that you took a country from other people?
Well technically speaking, there're a few things that could probably stop your free speech Vordox, but most of them would be remarkably illegal.
Kandarihu: Do you have any idea how many people USA killed during the immigration?
yeah
Kandarihu: Over the course of 200 years?
I like CoD. *ducks for the shit being thrown at me*
who thinks that G1's Escape from Nightmare Castle wasn't all that bad? I mean it did have RD's Spiritual Anscestor Fyre FLy, Spike , Applejack and SeaPonies.
I'm certainly not proud of that.
Kandarihu: Indeed, but you cannot be held responsible for that.
Oh dear, are we talking national usurpation here?
CountDoofus well thats like just your opnion man
13yay holding living people responsible for the actions of those long dead
Who is streaming anyways?
For loving my country despite that, I can be held responsible for that.
/me gives a weird stare at CountDoofus forgives and gives a towel for him to clean up
Because that's the sensible thing to do Shizuka.
people logic :7
Actually, it makes me want to slap people, but I'll restrain myself.
Kandarihu: Good. then make it your country that you can live in without fear and being stopped for speaking free.
And for trying to control the speech of others, I cannot escape responsibility.
13you know vordox you stole the planet from the single celled organisms billions of years ago
13you should be ashamed
You ever read a history of England?
We hung witches, YOU GUYS BURNED THEM AT THE STAKE

It already hasn't Lightning-Quill.
13you stole the material to build earth from the cloud that formed the sun
Mostly these kinds of conversations depress me.

There's....

I honestly, can't see anything else genocidial except for the wars that broke out.
Vordox i mean shit our whole royal family comes from them

Meanwhile: indeed

*bow chicka bow wow*

There was a considerable amount of profanity in Ponies Anthology 1, that I didn't appreciate. Anthology 2 is better about that. Sure, I was a bit bored by some of it. It's hard to be perpetually entertained by 80 minutes of non-sequiturs.
Who is streaming anyways? 6_9
Scoot-Scootaloo: And some art stuff too, which was the...4th or 5th part of this video
SCOOTALOOS STREAMING

Oh gawd whats wrong with me
No one in the world ever gets what they want and that is beautiful. Everybody dies frustrated and sad and that is beautiful.
Hey, I just came real quick to ask what movies will be played tonight
Kammerjunk: initiating emotions .A.,
i dont even craee what you stream,it could even be grass growing,it can even be g3 ponies, JUST ANYTHING IS BETTER THEN THIS WHITE RING OF DEATH
insert Donnie Darko quote here.
Alchemist: I love you
Dr_Fumbles: Tonight, we'll be watching "Road to El Dorado" as the A film and "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" for the B film, with "Ponyville Confidential" and "Feeling Pinkie Keen" as the pony episodes.
:)
sergio_scriptor: careful what you wish for...
You're all very kawaii
the B movie is so very british
Uguu
sergio_script: -show's G3.5- arth thou mad bro?
Kammerjunk: tyvm :)
lali-ho Onii-chan
Goddesses bless copypaste.
DrHobo: NOOOO,BRING BACK THE RING,BRING BACK THE RING
So... is everybody buffering?
sergio_scriptor: >:3
You're buffering. >:V
Dr_Fumbles: noones streaming right now.
Dr_Fumbles: yep
Erriday I'm buffein'.
It's not a buffer, it's a hypnosis
bufferin* goddammit
G3.5, where, I must hide!
Oh, G3.5 is on? Why didn't you tell me?!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0Rau01wbeo :$
Random Ping For The Day: Kabaka
No, but seriously dari, you should stream Newborn Cuties.
Guess I'll head back into Minecraft for the time being, cya later
what
bye Dr_Fumbles
Have fun, Dr_Fumbles.
bye for now Dr_Fumbles
Kammerjunk: I swear, for April Fools day next year, they should stream nothing but G3.5 episodes with hour long buffer waits inbetween. It would teach to not be impatient and to appreciate all generations. Also great prank.
It'll be fun watching Road to El Dorado again. I watched it all the time on VHS.
I dont have inspiration for minecraft...
Kammerjunk: me too :)
Bonjourrrrrrrrrrr, you cheese eating surrendering monkeys
Alchemist: try to build a castle
DrHobo: To be honest, G3.5 and G3.6 are the only bad generations. G1 was alright and G2 was the same, although different.
Alchemist: or a sparta pit
DrHobo: Best. Prank. Ever.
sergio_scriptor: I fooled around with redstone and stuff, then watched a few vids on YT and all my inspiration evaporated :D
DrHobo the butt hurt would be amazing
Kammerjunk: there was a G3.6? wasn't the baby version G#.5?
sergio_scriptor: some of those people are evil geniuses
alexxm: ikr
DrHobo or better yet, a 48 hour marathon
DrHobo: Eenope. Newborn Cuties is G3.6.
Dken2021: no, ven THATS to evil.
Alchemist: indeed
Kammerjunk: what was G3.5 then?
DrHobo: http://mylittlewiki.org/w/images/9/9b/Untitled-10.jpg Behold.
it was the one with oddly shaped bodies
Kammerjunk:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! IT BURNS! WTH WAS THAT!
g3.5 is time of nightmares
DrHobo: Not yet, it doesn't. This is G3.6: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGlaR_BtS90
The unholy grail.
its interesting to see that the original characters were much more horse(pony) like and they gradually became more cartoonish
why would you post that Kammerjunk
Kammerjunk: god help us,god help us all
alexxm: Purely for educational reasons.
Kammerjunk: Oh god. it's even worse watching it the 2nd time! OAO
alexxm: ...And because I'm a sadistic git.
Actually, I was just going to charge into a castle during a thunderstorm riding a T-rex, with with an army of undead by my side... well, that Necromancer isn't gonna kill himself...
Kammerjunk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhRnWMBcNQQ
Also, if you listen closely, you can hear that the Newborn Cuties theme melody is similar to G3.5.
alexxm: wat
Kammerjunk what
random stuff is random
I don't even. I really don't.
What's the difference between G3 and G3.5?
Sheet. I accidently hit like trying to hit dislike on a newborn cutie episode! AAAGH!
Kandarihu: G3 was less bad.
Kammerjunk you show us G3 i show you unrlenting terror
DrHobo: :d
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0HIDrk8Muc&feature=related - random Batman song is random

sergio_scriptor: Me

You're supposed to keep peanut butter at room temperature
I do not like peanut butter.
i wouldn't know, peanut butter doesn't exist in England, to my knowledge
tigher1001 Jostice for all, Case 3, I'm in the first investigation phase
...
BronyInstrumental: Of course it does
Loads of people here eat peanut butter
i've never found any ¬_¬ otherwise i'd love to try some
Lil_B wait are you on ace atourney
tigher1001 I talked to everyone and showed everything and everyone to everyoner, but nothing is happening and i can't progress
tigher1001 yes
BronyInstrumental: It does, you just have to look reallllly hard
Peanut butter isn't real butter though
It doesn't melt
BronyInstrumental: peanut butter is my everything <3
We watching somethig?
pony_9543: heroes

Whirlybird: it doesnt melt
Lil_B but im also on ace atourney
Whirlybird: melting is a chemical reaction
Whirlybird: changing from one state of matter to the next PERMANENTLY
Unnr: THNAK YOU

Because I don't know anyone who keeps it in the fridge here, that'd just be weird
You all got me hungry, time to make peanut butter sandwiches

And have a proff that no one gives a f*ck
Nutella is the worlds best Invention and belongs not into the fridge!
k, After watching Barbie(™) Life in the Dreamhouse, all I can say is "not again, NOT AGAIN!! AAAAUGHH!"
Lil_B: i like nuttela in my fridge
Back of the peanut butter says
The science of peanutbutter!
I checked the newsletter and they never said when the lottery is
"Store in a cool dry place" Which are the instructions given on thing usually kept in cupboards
No one
Gives
A f*ck
sergio_scriptor: your nick reminds me of Sergio Aragones
lol
Mirathrim: Are you seriously correcting moot discussions on BronyState?
Mirathrim: "Lego" instructions: "Do not eat this" OH I MUST BE SMART AND NOT GIVING A FUCK! *Eats and dies*
Unnr: :P well thank you,but it was not intentional
This is the place for pointless conversations.
sergio_scriptor well, I guess you can cut it into small pieces put them on bread :)
ok im at a movie studio trying to get a key but this girl wont let me
And (heated) discussions.
Lil_B: exactly
We discuss pointless stuff all the time
Vordox: nom lego nom
is the lottery tonight or saturday
Mirathrim: Why you censoring yourself on the interweb?
Vordox: eating Legos ir relatively harmless, but DO NEVER STEP ON THEM!
diddutz: ....ow...memories.
i just love how we are using the chat to discuss about nuttela and peanutbutter,istead of talking about the shows plot :)
WHEN IS THE LOTTERY? TONIGHT? OR SATURDAY?
Where is your capslock?
kidzrul434 tonight i think
I stepped on a lego and hit my knee on a glass table.
It should be tonight
diddutz: That's nothing. I used to have this Warhammer set. Goblins with spears.
"Nuclear Warhead" "Do not punch the top or it'll explode" "Oh fuck dat, I do this cause I don't care about the quality and how to use things " *Punches it*
Good Goddesses, I hated them.
I'm eating my dinner with lemonade tonight
Hi

/me derped
Not any more.
Snap
Wait..wait...
3No, the three big Nintendo RPGs that came out around the world recently. Pandora's Tower, Xenoblade, and Last Story.
So her sister was a special person that can possess....
sergio_scriptor - Toranaga: Never played either, haven't even heard of the latter.
HER SCHIZO PERSONALITY GIVES HER SUPER STRENGTH
And she has strength? Shit
Why would anyone ever object to that...
OOT is best Zelda
SlurryMoon: Yeah, I never heard about any of those.
Lots and lots of crickets
That depends. Never a good answer.
Needless to say, I don't play a lot of Nintendo.
SlurryMoon where do you live?
this series should be only about hiro
SlurryMoon = Is Last Story out now?
3In Texas
3And Last Story I know is coming out soon.
She was...special :D
>sergio It should have ended with season 1
3I know

SlurryMoon Pandoras Tower is more Like Zelda, but its nice really :)
>Sleep
Ha ha ha.

PULP FICTION

nothing like getting a big wad on pay day
Sleep is for the weak
Pulp Fiction?
Pandora's Tower will make you hungry.
Vacation_Wrek: did you saw pulp fiction before ? if yes then sleep if no GO SEE PUPL FICTION
And now she thinks you're a lunatic.
Meaning that he can hear people's thoughts.
oh hey Vacation_Wrek watch your ponies or the stream of heroes
Tovler no girl can eat that much meat, Raw in one go...
implying i can watch the stream on this net

Bronysith = Denial isn't healthy pal. It was fun while it lasted.
So much Vegas.
Invisible.
LAWL
....
NOBODY SEES ME
HOLY BUCK it's Ecleston ! :O
You can't see this.
The Doctor is now invisible.
I haven't seen Heroes in ages, so I can't remember, what is Peter's ability?
/me is gay for eccleston, tennant, spitfire, braeburn, the jacket from spirits within, john de lancies voice
he got is Tardis parked somewhere
Peter is a sponge
He gets the abilities of people near him
Bronysith, oh my
Bronysith: Spitfire is a mare,.
We now know what happens to Doctors after Regeneration
Lol Bronysith Braeburn?
Kammerjunk: so? even women are gay for tennant
Emo male nurse spongeboy
Toranaga: EVERYPONY is gay for Braeburn.
Peter is powered by pure plotcontrivance
BronyInstrumental: Silly filly, you can't be gay for someone the opposite sex.
Lil_B as far as I know, she is a 23 year old metalhead woman :)
True...I guess I'm gay for Braeburn to
That's illogical.
xD
Fl00tersh41: you mean deus ex machina
WEAK CLIFFHANGER
Objection, cliffhanger.
Well not really he would harm if he was a sponge more or kess he adopts their abilities
EggWhite: he copies the abilities of those around him
OBJECTION
Kammerjunk: uhh i never said anything
Objection sustained
Overruled!
"We're all a little gay" ~Aisha Tyler
NO
BronyInstrumental: Wait, did I ping you? I beg your pardon.
Silly tab key.
Kammerjunk: it's quite alright :)
Invi|omnom sounds awesome, I always though GilDash is male XD
What shall we watch next guys?
Lil_B: Say what you sir need to be more observant
Bai~
Thanks for streaming dari.

Fruit time? Can I have a Mango?
11,02Yesh :#
11,02:3

Lil_B ever noticed how she spoke of herself in the 3rd person in the RP? ^^
/me hugs PonyNegZero
Oh hey there, OmegaMetroidBrony. It's been a while.
We should watch Dr. Who
Is it normal that I can see the pony chat administrators page?
Stepping out to handle things guys. I'll see you for FRIDAY NIIIIIGHT!!! and showtime.
SuperBanana64: I can't believe I completely forgot about fruit time.
Invi: Lil_B You silly fillies,
/me waves to SuperBanana64, and everypony else
SG-1 IS AWEESOOOOOOME :=D
Oh hai Applejazz indeed it has been a while

BronyInstrumental: you english?
Bronysith: No stream at the moment.
USS_Sulaco yes i am! :D
Invi no :/ I'm never part of the RP XD I don't know how to do such things, so I never paid close attention :(
11,02Kiwijunk: Well...I just randomly declared it :3
oooh dat molestia http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2113/
/me sits ontop of Sumica
BronyInstrumental: ha so am i!
I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE THIS SHOW
What is this?
SuperBanana64: Oh. Well, I remember something very alike fruit time a while ago, at any rate.
00,10ohhi

Did Desktop Ponies Update?
Lil_B: Regardless of what anyone else has told you, he /is/ male.
WELLLLL YEAAAAAH
Lil_B I meant the molestation RP she always does
Ahhhhhh yeeeeeaahhhh
BUCK YEAH Got my new headphones!
11,02Kiwijunk: Yeah...I think it might be a coincidence that I randomly said it at this time >>
soulrider95: Neat. What kind?
11,02soulrider95: CONGRATS :D
Kiwijunk: Sennheiser HD 518.
Meanwhile I think that what she told me too, I am getting confused here :/ ... I'll just ask him next time I see her XD
Lil_B: He'll probably lie to you, just saying.
DIS COMINC
11,02O.O
soulrider95: Oh, I like those. Myself, I prefer wireless, though.
The lagg is killing meeee
wraiths are way more scary then ghouls
hai everypony
sup folks
So I can go downstairs and make a nice cup o' tea while still listening to music
Can't you just fire a laser through the portal or something
hi IshBestPony
ello
hey IshBestPony hows your day been
heeeey, SG1
Is this Stargate?
Watching sci-fi while playing EVE Online - How very fitting.
hello regs...
Fl00tersh41: if they fire a laser,they can get throught
Lil_B Gildy is here atm ^^
Of course this is stargate
00,10nah it's wormhole extreme
IshBestPony: YES
Deeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad.

Vordox: dat malcom in the middle

I just remebered what episode this is "AND I LOVE THIS EPISODE"
Bronysith wut?
/me is busy. Please call back later.

GilDash: This
this looks pretty early on
Hi everypony :D
sergio_scriptor what episode is this

So what's stopping a laser from simply burning a hole in the iris?
nope?
/me calls GilDash back later
okay then
LAWL
hey Sonic_The_Pony hows your day been
alexxm: the enemy within i think
INTRO IS BUCKING EPIC
See, GilDash is busy XD
thanks sergio_scriptor
I love you Richard Dean Anderson!!!!!!
It's...3rd I think.
00,10I would think that the wormhole would distort the focus of a laser
Stargate SG1?
yeah its failry early
ahah it is
William Anderson is better
My kitty follows me into my room when I'm eating meat, but she goes especially crazy if it's poultry, ham, or seafood
dat theme song
wait, macgyer?
richard dean anderson xD
i just cant belive im watching one of my favorite sci-fi shows of all time in bronystate :)
When stuff goes through the iris, it's broken down IIRC, so that would screw stuff up.
The Enemy Within.
Yes MisterFoster, that is Macgyver, it was explained in a Simpsons episode
I can't believe I'm watching this show i somehow never really liked right now :/ ... whatever XD
00,10this is the first ep, if you dont count the pilot ep.
Lil_B it's bronystate ^^
Sumica oh goody, I've never seen this show before
wraiths form stragate atlantis are way more scary then ghouls :|
Oh, cool. I haven't watched this series.
Invi it's Bronystate, don't question it XD
imma play on a tekkit MC MLP server
sergio_scriptor whats the differance? i'm not familar with this series
Invi I'm not going to GalaCon :( Tickets are all sold out :'(
All he needs is a paper clip, some string, and a rubber band
Lil_B whoa, that popular? °_O
00,10more blue and crome in the base alexxm
Who's the dancing pony in the corner?
no duct tape?
thanks Sumica
that reminds me i still need to order my tickets to B.U.C.K!
what r we watching :P
Lil_B maybe that will bring the bronyhood more out in germany ^^
Invi I know, I think all the Main Tickets were sold out before July (sales started in June) and now the last ones are gone :(
BronyInstrumental what is BUCK
alexxm: ghouls are serpents that get inside a person brain and then control it,usualy given super-human powers to them,a wratith is humanoid creature that feeds on human energy,basicly if a wratih catches you he makes you get older until you die,and feeds on vital energy
Surprise, you're dead.
Brony UK Convention
Lil_B reminds me of Wacken xD
what is this that where watching
Invi, are you german?
thanks sergio_scriptor
BronyBro: Stargate sg1
rainbowgambler >.> <.< uuh, yes
k
Invi I'm telling you, nobody here will ever know this exists, unless RTL, ZDF, etc are reporting on it (doesn't matter if they take a shit on it or not)
jaffa do not give fucks by nature
Lil_B xD especially RTL
aren´t there enough bronies here in germany?
whats in 45 min im new so i dont know much about this sight yet
FRIDAY NIIIIIIIGHT of course
Has Bronystate streamed Dr Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog yet?
BronyBro: WELCOME TO THE HERD
Movie night BronyBro
BronyBro: it will be friday movie night
Lil_B O.O let's hope Die Bild ignores it O.O
Been a while since I tended a Friday night
*attended
What films are on?
BronyBro...came right in time for the movie night
Check front page
USS_Sulaco: road to el dorado as A movie
rainbowgambler why? :3
oki doki!
awesome but is there any way to tell wat where gonna watch
Is this a continuation or pin-off of a previous series?
no
Invi there was a short like in the ZTF News where they mentioned BronyCon thoug... "A Bunch of groqwn males enjoing a Show ment for Little Girls..." Its the german Version of Fox News :(
*spin-off
but it is a continuation of the original movie
inb4 ded
BronyBro: road to el dorado
which was slightly different than the series that followed
Invi I know at least 20 or so at my uni
ghoul
DSNesmith whats a movie?
I LOVE THAT MOVIE!!!! ITS MY CHILDHOOD!!!
Dead.
alexxm: that was a ghoul
Oh boi...
GHOUL'S SUCKS
What do people do when they don't undrstand something. You mock it
Lil_B .... ZDF huh? *grabs Gustav gun*
BronyBro: Tell me about it. I watched it all the time on VHS.
IshBestPony: SG-1 is a spinoff of the movie Stargate
Lightning-Quill: or they fear it and shun it
DSNesmith no no, I mean what is a movie?
same lol i havent seen it in like 6 years or so
....
go google it
exactly
rainbowgambler 20 Germans? :D are there people of the Saarland too? :3
DSNesmith what does it mean to google
If the star gates are the main method of travel in the galaxy, why haven't the badguys done anything to secure them?
Invi *TF2 Heavy*"Gustav is gud and thrustfull... ZDF is not"
Fl00tersh41: they did
No they haven't
/me noms on Vordox
Fl00tersh41: both the good guys and bad guys have acess to stargates
That dancing pony really suits SB
Lil_B de gudde Gustav krischt se all :D
it's distracting
There's hardly ever a major military camp right ontop of the gates they walk through
/me gives kirzstryfe a annoyed look, then takes out a Strawberry lollipop.
Here
DSNesmith what does distracting mean?
00,10SB?
desktop ponies has OCs now?
/me noms on Vodox's entire hand that is holding the lollipop
Invi nah, 20 in heidelberg, and several others across the country, and I think for an english show it´s kinda good
Fl00tersh41: they have codes,machineguns,laser,all sort of brick a brack to protect them
It would be the single most important place on any planet they are on after all
Damnit did I get the streamer wrong?
I'm not talking about the humans
what are humans?
I'm talking about the badguys
Invi de gude alde gustav, do hohtse oalle äwischt (suppost to be hessian accent as we speak it in our villige :) )
00,10Fl00tersh41, there is more out there then just the bad guys
rainbowgambler Heidelberg? that is pretty close ^^
Is he... A wizard?
Fl00tersh41: that is beacuse the bad guys have like 100 stargate son diferent planets,human only have 1 :|
The guys who had thousands of years to secure the place yet never did
if fluttershy is ur fav pony make the face :(
00,10yeah OmegaMetroidBrony
:(
O.O
08,01hey all
08,01i just read the *best* pinkiedash fic!
urgh, shipping
nope
08,01Unnr: there really is
Lil_B Isch schwätzn wei lieba Saarlännisch :) (I prefer talking Saarlännisch now :) )
/me has a hard time imagining pinkie pie being shipped with any pony.
08,01theres also good pinkieshy fics
08,01Unnr: ill pm it you
Yay!
Invi yeah, but I think in larger cities like munich or so could be more bronies, heidelberg isn´t exactly a large city
rainbowgambler are you from germany?
08,01alexxm: i... cant tell you in here
Fl00tersh41: do you understand now ?
Lil_B yeah
No
rainbowgambler well it is a pretty big city
rainbowgambler me too :) which state?
Fl00tersh41: :| GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,you are making it hard to explain :|
watch this vid: http://youtu.be/viTkj0eu-fk
THIS IS TA'Ry!
I wonder why the ghould didn't simply nuke earth when it first rebelled
Surprise!
Lil_B formerly MV, but now Baden-Württemberg
Fl00tersh41: BEACUSE THEY DONT HAVE NUKES
No video links during stream BronyBro
Earth was setting a bad example for slaves everywhere
They have spaceships
Fl00tersh41:
why bother
aww ok its a great vid tough
the earthlings didn't have a stargate
Why because we are awesome
inb4 2nd ded doctor
they had no interstellar communications
Invi mmh, if you count Mannheim, too
Lil_B the first ''foreign'' language my grandma lerned was german because she only knew ''Brotdorfer Blatt'' => our hometown had it'S own language xD <.<
Thus they have all they need to make the relatavistic equivalent of a nuke
like Teal'c says, it would be a massive investment of resources
8,6BronyBro, no video links during a stream please
well thats an intreasting explantion for why all the aliens look human
When was this movie made?
sg-1
for no discernable gain
Those Colors
Fl00tersh41: technacly humans are way more advanced then ghouls,gouhls dont even have eletricity
rainbowgambler ok, I'm from Mittle-Hessen, there are no Bronys here, I go to the Meetups in Franfurt thou
08,01well, if you want the names of the fics im referring to, pm me
Not back when earth first rebelled
Ded
rainbowgambler I'm living in the countryside. everything above 10k people is a big city for me
Humans where little more than cavemen then
/me glomps Rain
That's ominous.
CALL SOLDIERS NOW
IDIOT DOCTOR IS IDIOT!
Lil_B that´s kinda a far way
Fl00tersh41: yes,but they left,and human burried the stargate so that they could not return
Satun: i lost my internet before i was able to read your reply to my inventory check. could you please re-PM your answer?
Only if they are not bloody
going to bed. Have a fun movie night everyone!
Why did they do that?
should have done that the moment he saw the symbiote
nighty Alchemist
RED SPY IN THE BASE!
Invi I'm actually terrible at speaking in the accent of my village, I can barely understand my grandma and mother when they are talking to each other XD
It sets a terrible example for all other slaves everywhere
So what's the movie coming up again
Fl00tersh41: beacuse of the war against the ancients(builders of the stargates)
Invi that explains a lot :D
Lil_B the same for my grandma with my father :D
STARGATE
O_O
Lil_B you should hear me speaking plattdütsch
But when you let slaves get away with rebelling, you're just going to have more slave revolts on your hands
ghouls are pussys
I really do like SG-1 for having the guts to go with a military approach as opposed to ripping off star trek
Is the euro night movie the same as tonights?
:(
rainbowgambler I'm living in one of the biggest cities around here with about 3k people in it. I am glad that I have Interweb access :D
USS_Sulaco: Aye, euro night is for the benefit of people who might miss tonights.
Fl00tersh41: yes,i cant explain ok ? They just left,and humans burried and that it
who's streaming?
/me is sad
/me 08,01hugs IshBestPony
IshBestPony whats the matter
Meanwhile: im english so i couldnt watch tonights as id be knackered

Evening Ponies, and guess whose drunk off their flank for this movie night?
I just noticed the ponies watching the movie
Aztecs. Famous for pyramids and heart eating.
Gold floats?
I'm pretty impressed by the movies visuals as well :D
The leads are a nice change of pace
Cortez conquered the Aztecs, so I'm guessing these guys are Aztecs

Gold!!!
PaladinDrakkenwolf: You mean besides everyone?
Evening PaladinDrakkenwolf I'm guessing you
El Dolrado.
is that the gold becomes worthless
0,14either way, if they're looking for El Dorado, they're in the wrong continent
08,01operatorpony: ewww
my eyes
MY EYES
rather go to equestria
look at the egyptians
its only a model
Gold! Gooooooooooooooooooooooooold!
They found it. Movie over.
That is why it is an often used trope.
El Dorado was believed to be its own civilization, like the Aztec or Inca, but it is generally connected to the Aztecs
04Well

swag
k, brb. getting a beer
I love Goooooooooooooooooold!
Ghosties: It's from DreamWorks, they never made bad movies

It's like Atlantis only it's not underwarter.
I Love Goo- DAMNIT
You know it's too bad you can't put speech bubbles on the Mane 6 shadows (Of course you wouldn't because that would be in the way of the screen), but at that rock part you could have had one of them go "Look familar, Rairty?" Rairty: "SHUT UP!"
even the BUGS are gold
Given that El Dorado is ficticious, I imagine they're on the wrong planet.
Meanwhile s moustache is exectuioner
The golden butterflies are a nice touch...
even the butterfly are out of gold
gold butterflies
So what does El Dorado translate to, anyway? The Gold?
