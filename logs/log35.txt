http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/436/Wasteland.html
Yep
EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY
on Abandinia also
you do / and then nick and then whatever
DNF is okay, but nowhere near being good enough to warrant a $60 price tag.
Just Nick?
I know.
already liked that comment
yep
DNF levels are too linear.
worth 20 imo
Oh wow, that is some horrible graphics.
25 at most
:p
This wasn't the 8bit one though I was talking about
cant wait to see it
:
I'm ashamed that I let graphics get in the way of some great games.
gearbox is a disappointing dev
DN3D
There are no pirated games on Abandonia
lol
at least he can hold 2+ guns
I need to torrent and see how it stands up tbh
fayul
DNF isn't good
I heard that in Pinkie's voice
It's called CyberJudas
My bugs are all getting old and dying
D:
I have a napkin on top of my head.
@misery actually I feel bad for them because they got handed a shoddy 12 year project and had to just polish it and send it out.
i am enjoying it
I'm just waiting for it to get uploaded now lol
:D
way to much to unlock x3
I just want more people to learn of Battlezone.
Not downloading it from torrent sites
lol
D:
DNF isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.
6YES
wat is this
lol
It's still not worth $60 though.
oh this
0@bunnylisk wouldn't that get a little old
0Oh ho
0No colours
woo this again =D
They went out happily though
I'll play DNF when it drops into the bargin bin

It's like Squad-based except on a larger-scale.
Rainbow Six?

Not good enough.
One of my favorites, Chromehounds, no longer has an online server though
Although I do like Rainbow Six

0Can't remember
0oh.
o
0Yeah
by FIAB
0Why not?
cause he named it that
BronyJack lmao
is that awesome? or weird?
Sega killed the online servers after 3 years?
0It's an awesome name
Hey, I'm not complaining...
It's not quite RTS level-stuff, but it's more strategy than alot of the shooters out there.
That's bad
Not LOUDLY, anyway...
my ex bf just didnt get it XD
Yep
Chromehounds?
@Bronyjack Clop Clop?
Yepc
Chromehounds
Speaking of long-forgotten games.

Anyone remember Conflict Seires?
*Series
I really want FPSs to ditch the whole regen health thing
Never got to play it. It looked interesting enough but I had no budget for it at the time
i agree
I dig it
and that is dumb
It really was
0Just like Witchcraft
It looked fun D=
Not the best but it was def. fun
DNF £40
0Spycraft is awesome.
I blame Mechassault for liking mech based games.
I didn't know she had a mule
Belmont!

xP
Damn, forgot how long this is
Yeah IK

http://www.abandonia.com/fr/games/471/Mechwarrior.html
