11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Most of the arachnids appearing on film are CGI but a few life-sized, robotic models were built. However, during the battle scenes, the actors wound up looking at director Paul Verhoeven himself who would stand in front of them and jump and scream to elicit their reactions.
You must construct additional Pylons.

I mean, they are useful for that purpose
This chat is always off-topic

and conclusion, B movie actually wasn't bad.
I love you guys we had a great summer =D
0i love these nights. :)))
I found this movie difficult to clop to
SOMEONE STREAM ROBOCOP
Maybe Horses are Asian
I'm still sad the whore didn't die. T_T
WHO WANTS PRIMUS
After which, they conducted horrible mutations and turned into loving ponies

That was so awesome. I had a great time. I hope to see you all soon on Ponychan.
12wbs
I WANT ROBOCOP
0ROBOCLOPCLOPCLOPCLOP
lol wut.
So far...
13There's a 2nd one AND a 3rd one
Ponies = caucasian
Zeebas = African
Alicorn = God
11A REMINDER EVERYPONY!
6Just some announcements, guys.
Unicorn = ?
4There will be a re-airing of the stream tomorrow at 2 PM EST
Donkeys = Latino/Aztecs/w.e.
It's quite difficult to keep up with this channel while multi-tasking with others.
11TOMORROW WE WILL BE RE-STREAMING
6HOPEFULLY WITH LESS LAG
Earth pony = ?
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-348894.html#348894
Dwarves
Ponies = land ponies, pegasi, and unicorns fyi
Fuckfaces
11THE SHOWING WILL BEGIN AT 2PM EST
4thanks
here's that video I told you about earlier today
Anyways
Yikes
Language.
Where am I?
And Horses maybe = Asian
11THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATRONAGE AND HOPE YOU HAD FUN (as much as could be had with the lag)
What is this place?
okay
I'm confused.
4We thank you for attending, we hope you stay for the post-show
11ALSO
Stronger and hardier than the unicorns and Pegasi. Earth Ponies are dwarves. They can't do magic as well as unicorns, or fly like a pegasus, but they are tougher
Why am I bound and gagged?
And Sapphire Shores is half black, half white
How can I type if I'm bound and gagged?
You were about to give me your money
I mean half zeebra and half pony
There are no horses yet, I don't think.
Is that why she has no cutie mark?
Night, keep your dorky DND out of this
If you choose the blue pill, you'll wake up and believe whatver you want to believe...
Unless Big Mac is asian, Agnitio.
xP
11REMEMBER, IF YOU WISH FOR REGULAR EMAIL UPDATES, SEND AN EMAIL TO BronyState@Gmail.com

Big Mac's just a big pony
Okay race discussion is getting a little weird...

13YOU WANNA LIVE FOREVER?
6Also, I'm awesome, just saying.

In summation: Where am I? What is this place? Why am I bound and gagged? How can I type if I'm bound and gagged?
But you guys turn it into a racial discussion
Ivan, well you get mules and Sapphire Shores for sure

Dash is only better than Twist
'night everypony
Some people consider a Cousin's Kids to be more cousins, while others consider them Nephews and Nieces. So in Equestria BlueBlood could be very distantly related and still be a nephew.

Your point?
imagine how long it took to make
They're applying races, not dubbing one ofr the other inferior
the only lyric would be bacon
equeestriiia
But still,.
Guile's theme goes with everything sonic rainboom
Bridle Gossip, there's a difference between racism and racial appearances, silly
I prefer to own my games through the convience of steam.

It'll develop into that if we don't stop

1890's cartoons are the best
oh the 90's they where safer in the UK it seems
sooooooo were actually watching this eh
Hey, it beats the hell out of Chowder or Flapjack.
uhh
because i don't remember this
hi
11"Rappoleon?" oh god
Rapoleon
FRENCH RAPPERS.
dafuq
hi
Hmm, toche Dee
i have successfully converted my brother
Penis head.

Dee_Twenty Chowder was awesome
What were you guys on in the 80s?
yay
...this french guy is already getting im my nerves
dear god
SACRE BLEU!
Awesome.
???
0in a perfect world, people would be euthanised for puns like that
11Don't let Nostalgia Critic see this.
11It'll kill him.
DAT HAIR
fayul
and see which pony steals his soul
If by awesome you mean painful.
Well the original C&C was uploaded to Abandonia in '04
DAT AMAZING ANIMATION
his eyes. lol
So, if Fallout abandonware?
My fail senses are tingling...
This feels xenophobic
NC can handle this
Aye Silverscreen, it will
*is
and that article's '07
He's handled worse
I only converted my sister, but, she's a girl who doesn't know how to internet properly so it doesn't count.
plaf?
No Fallout is NOT abandonware
in other words Silverscreen, show it to him immediately
Ze legs!
captain N the game master
Oh my god. What's wrong with your HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIR.
FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
a french rapper, now ive seen everything
what kinda sound is "plaf?"
I'm guessing you do not enjoy surreal humor?
In that case, let the Nostalgia Critic see this right away
Obsidian still sells the original Fallout and Fallout 2
Eeyup, this does look like a early 90's cartoon
and the spinoffs
Tha's me!
Seriously, wat? I want to say something else, but all I can summon is wat.
IDK i think its slightly better than animated titanic
They're pretty cheap though, iirc.
this is just horrible...
10 bucks for that pizza
this is really embarising...
By not internetting properly, I mean she uses just Facebook.
Meh, a brony's a brony.
my god... the pizza man has no neck
Online or off.
But imo, it shouldn't be abandonware anyways since its such an epic game
That's not internetting properly.
lol wut?
xP
6This is getting stopped.
11 10 buck?!
I want some pizza.....
Oh god, The animated titanic
11damn!
Nice voice
She doesn't even know the term brony
great
lol Dark
6It's just... what.
11That better be a good pizza.
for the love of all things holy stop this
Ctrl Alt Del the annotated series
do it
6Unless ponies object.
damn this is gonna hurt in the mornin-- oh yea rite it's 06:16am
It doesn't make her any less of one.
0why are you making me watch this
So, what good abandonware games are there?
a helmet means he is genius
She doesn't know what 4chan is.
Those are some legs from Starship Troopers!
stop...please
0do i owe you money or something
DOSbox stuff?
same here 6:16
please stop this
I'd rather see the Dover Boyrs of Pimento University that...whatever THIS is.
Well you can browse Abandonia
It's the wrong trousers Gromit! The wrong trousers!
euro?
Its his thinking cap
*Boys
His lips don't match his words.
I MO
@GabeMoist Which animated titanic movie?
Dosbox stuff.
It's got games sorted into genres
it hurts so much
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT AN OS IS FOR CELESTIA'S SAKE.
Awesome
and alphabetical order
both of them
she can't computer very well.
oh this one x3
Watch Tentacles. It will kill your brain
Oh, have you heard of Battlezone?
It's also worth checking out STeaM, and Atari ST emulator.
And she's 15.
AgnitioExMachina: Obsidian doesn't. Bethesda gets the checks, I believe.
Wow, the intro had 10X more quality than the show did
dam add.
thank god
both are bad the but one with the sharks is horrid
its been a while since cheese has done a YTP
I need to get away from this, but i can't quite reach the button with the big red X on it
xP
had to ref
ok I don't feel like I'm going to die
og god... this one I remember
There were a fair few good games on that.
0we should watch Two Best Friends Play
Also, Star Control 2. GOGOGO
11Wow. You KNOW it's bad when THIS show looks so good.
There were animated Titanic movies? Why have I not been informed of this?
Zeb, good point but it's still being sold
the ones Nostalgia Critic reviewed
and Obsidian made it
Pinkazoid!
Anyone heard of Battlezone?
I love two best friends play
Yeah, they're definitely not abandonware.
Black Isle made it.
The one with the talking dolphin and sharks it the worst one!
I FREAKIN' LOVED THAT ON N64
0@paperpony brohoof
Also Obsidian got to make Fallout New Vegas
11RainbowSmash: There were TWO Animated Titanic movies
Obsidian's a lot of the same people, but different.
There's the bad one, then the worse one
lol
Jim Cummings makes a better Robotnik
dafuq
And N64 versioned sucked, the pc version is AWESOME
is it just me or is "robotnlk wants KFC playing?
Black Isle made it but Obsidian published
and why....
They were terrifying
Obsidian didn't exist then, dude :P
fapfapfapfap
talesss
because its funny x3
evening everyone
Interplay published it originally
not funny.
Three if you count the sequel to the one with the evil talking sharks.
Well...you got me
yeah TWO ones a bad rip off of the moive the second is just disturbing
We should watch them
Yo!
AgnitioExMachina: Try Battlezone
Obsidian was formed after Interplay closed Black Isle
Yep, Tentacles
LOL
>youtube poop funny?
(I might be a huge nerd about their history ;)
such great art
I'm now convinced that Grounder is the first Patrick.
I miss this show
This is less wat, but still kinda wat.
Someone knows Fallout history better than I do
dear god
Are they even so bad it's good bad or worse?
Old school Sonic and Mario cartoons, back then it was one of the best console wars of all time
Trust me, it's the only game of it's kind, aside from the sequel
11...

Yep, sorry:(
There's a repeat tomorrow.
0i'm not sure if i should keep watching or just log off and smash my monitor
We need about 20% more ponies.
http://sc2.sourceforge.net/
Ivan, I actually have the game that inspired Fallout
WHAT AM I WATCHING
Everyone should play this.
Pft, these younglings don't know shit about console wars. They should have served in the Nintendo/SEGA wars.
EVERYONE :x
Several actually
Smash it AND watch it.
It's called...hold on
hey don't forget atari!

Half life 2.
0does the aftershow consist entirely of YTPs and music videos?
There's another one but it's so 8bit it's bad
the brady bunch ponie
i miss the good old days for games, atleast duke cheered me up
s
agreed
lol
someone really needs to make a Primus PMV
yeah dnf is good
do an epic rap battle
What about Wasteland?
wasteland?
Wasn't that one?
DNF is ok
nicepeter
/me begins to wonder how long it take for ponies to start posting links to pirated copies of games
@nah well that and some other random vids
the hitler vs darth vader one
Ugh, what's the command for Registering a Nick?
SS:BF will be more fun i think
Got balls of steel ed but haven't gotten to play yet...
or chuck norris
We have yet to do that my friend
its /nick
http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/436/Wasteland.html
i love DNF it felt like a classic game
Yep
EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY
on Abandinia also
you do / and then nick and then whatever
StarShine /nick
11EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY: RAINBOW DASH vs. APPLEJACK
DNF is okay, but nowhere near being good enough to warrant a $60 price tag.
Just Nick?
I know.
already liked that comment
yep
DNF levels are too linear.
worth 20 imo
silverscreen, i wish i could see it =(
Oh wow, that is some horrible graphics.
25 at most
:p
This wasn't the 8bit one though I was talking about
what is DNF?
cant wait to see it
duke nukem forever
There's worse than that Ivan
:
But it's only a matter of time until somepony gets the wrong idea.
i got the balls of steel, was worth the bust and stuff it came with
the new game they made
Duke nukem forever
yeah I preorded on steam ges ago so...
ohlol
I'm ashamed that I let graphics get in the way of some great games.
Carpe Nukem motherfucker!
gearbox is a disappointing dev
cheap too because of friends that work at a game store
DN3D
There are no pirated games on Abandonia
For Balls of Steel here too. Worth it just to own Duke.
I almost didn't get X-Com because of that.
DNF = Duke Nukem FOREEEEEEEVEEEEERRRRRRRR!
lol
serious sam is better
at least he can hold 2+ guns
I need to torrent and see how it stands up tbh
i love serious sam
haha Serious sam is win
fayul
DNF isn't good
I heard that in Pinkie's voice
Anyways there's a game that I wanted that became Abandonware recently
duke will always have a place in my heart
11Duke Nukem Forever. It looks good, IMO. haters gonna hate.
serious sam is better + 1291347557867909876543213456786543
It's called CyberJudas
My bugs are all getting old and dying
he is the only serious action hero around
D:
serious sam would snap douk in half with two of his fingers
I have a napkin on top of my head.
@misery actually I feel bad for them because they got handed a shoddy 12 year project and had to just polish it and send it out.
i am enjoying it
I'm just waiting for it to get uploaded now lol
:D
way to much to unlock x3
DNF would have been so much better if Pinkie Pie just jumped out every once in a while and shouted "FOREVER!"
I just want more people to learn of Battlezone.
Not downloading it from torrent sites
lol
D:
do kahn vs easter bunny epic rap battle
DNF not worth the full price is soo short to say the MP is crap
6I'm iffy on the whole Duke nukem forever
aw i love this
DNF isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.
Yay
6YES
wat is this
lol
It's still not worth $60 though.
oh this
0@bunnylisk wouldn't that get a little old
yay
0Oh ho
I LOVE THSI SONG
YAY I love this
0No colours
yay
<3 avast fluttershy's ass great
woo this again =D
i like the yay part
They went out happily though
I may be exxagerating, but Battlezone was so new and unique.
yay
I'll play DNF when it drops into the bargin bin
this song in my head when every somthing good happemns to me now
0uh
Its not a terrible game.. Its just not like the old Duke games and that makes me sad.
love this
11yay
yay
Ooo, or how about Rarity's Naughty, sexy, bitchy
is a bit sureal
You played this song last Friday :)
I love this song
You're paying $60 for what is basically a port of a fourteen year old game.
they disappeared into the sky and became a big old blue gem
yay I love this
The yay is definitely the best part
yay yay yay yay
0im actually okay with this
FPS Strategy is something that I have always wanted in today's games.
wewt
Yay
this is cool
dude your all pathetic to listen to reviewers
Since chat slowed down... Hey guys.
You know that pencil I lost a long time ago?
love this song
dee_twenty, no. bad
yay
0>Implying people pay for games
Yeah?
Yayayayayayayayaayyayayayyyayayayayayayayyyayyayyayyayyayyayyayyyayyayy
I found it in my suitcase
Hey
:O
0sounds like a portal turret
There ARE FPS Strategy games out there btw
am Temped to eidt me a ringtone version
Hey, I pay for my games.
support the game to get a sequal, i don't want duke to die
Woah, really?
Hehe I bet you have no idea who I am.
It'll take FOREVER to learn these lyrics...
I guess I can give Jenna hers back now
fapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfapfap
i i i i don't don't don't
So... which abandonware game would you like to see revived and ponified?
has anyone else seen the rock band 3 adapt of this?
:D I'm happy
It's like Squad-based except on a larger-scale.
Rainbow Six?
no
i want also a remake of Duke 3D
No
iiiidontdontdont
I know how much you liked that pencil
*gasp* yay
i want it though
Not good enough.
One of my favorites, Chromehounds, no longer has an online server though
Although I do like Rainbow Six
I'm glad you found it
*Inhales deeply*........yay
Now that's a cheer.
lol
YAY!!!!
Rainbow Six is squad stuff. Battlezone you build your own base.
why is it called avast fluttershys ass
0^
favorite part is coming up
...did my cheering do that?
Look up Chromehounds...and don't effing buy it
it's form the original song
0The original song is Avast My Ass
90% of the game was online
lol
0Or Your ass
your
loop
And there's no more online
ah hell, its 6 am. goodbye everypony
0Can't remember
0oh.
My GF gets really "affectionate" while we watch ponies
o
0Yeah
by FIAB
why is the original song called that?
0Why not?
cause he named it that
BronyJack lmao
BECAUSE RENARD SAID SO
is that awesome? or weird?
Sega killed the online servers after 3 years?
0It's an awesome name
Hey, I'm not complaining...
It's not quite RTS level-stuff, but it's more strategy than alot of the shooters out there.
That's bad
Not LOUDLY, anyway...
my ex bf just didnt get it XD
Yep
ah ok just so there's a reason lol
Chromehounds?
@Bronyjack Clop Clop?
ITS NAMED THAT AS PER RENARD V.
Nightmare, you remember it?
0song's better than i thought, but the title's a little offputting
Yepc
Chromehounds
Speaking of long-forgotten games.
Nightmare, did you play it?
lol
its ment to make you laught as you play
Anyone remember Conflict Seires?
Its parodying a song called "Avast your Ass"
I'm not going to support anything if they can't earn my money for what they've already put out. If they want me to pay $60 for a Duke Nukem game, they need to get to work on one that's WORTH $60.
play the double rainbow song
Quick Avast Fluttershy's Ass: The song was actually posted under Fur Affinity under a much bigger name, but since it was too long and set up to be the first song of an album they decided to shorten it to Avast your ass, and it went off to become a song meme from tehre
*Series
I really want FPSs to ditch the whole regen health thing
Never got to play it. It looked interesting enough but I had no budget for it at the time
yay
yeah but its not up to scratch with serious sam
i agree
I dig it
It was a fun game to play lol
and that is dumb
hey, whoevers still talkign about duke nukem, go talk on pnychan =(
It really was
0Just like Witchcraft
It looked fun D=
i don't what
Not the best but it was def. fun
Fluttershy has an ass?
ss is liek £6 quid HD remake
DNF £40
0Spycraft is awesome.
0who's renard?
Conflict: Desert Storm, Conflict: Vietnam, and Conflict: Global Storm. Anyone remember these?
I blame Mechassault for liking mech based games.
I didn't know she had a mule
google him
0Furry music artist.
Nightmare, I got an idea, we should start-up our own server
Belmont!
yay
nah: www.lapfoxtrax.com
thats his site
0wait, uh, guy that made stylostyler?
yeah
he makes good music
@sol she has that random pony from the last episode
I'd need a pc copy and a machine capable of running it.
i like the part where it goes yay
JOHN FREEMAN
0i've been wondering who made that, thanks
the blank flank
=P
this particular FIAB album is kinda old
thing is, people who don't like it are people who did not grow up with duke nukem and grew up with FPS of today
OF COURSE!
lol
its quite funny
dude no
Toasters are notoriously bad at running games, I imagine
xP
Damn, forgot how long this is
duke nukem is the FPS of today
damn it, flash crashed on me.
Yeah IK
it's got personality
true
Anyways Nightmare, this game predated Mechassault
http://www.abandonia.com/fr/games/471/Mechwarrior.html
@rubenflonne I agree
I grew up with Duke, I loved Duke, but I don't love DNF.
No, I played original Duke Nukems
too much pony for chrome to handle!
thats the point of duke
Duke Nukem 3D is the FPS of forever.
but its nothing special
My laptop is a toaster, how'd you know?
It's actually what helped inspire it
I still hate DNF
*clopclopclop*
dam. i dont even know what channel MLP is on anymore
duke is personality
I think we need some Night of Pony
omg
yes
yes
DN3D is sooooooo fun
awwwww
I smell the bread being cooked over the internet
Rarity!
and for a game that took 12 years it needed to be special
night of pony!
xD
@rubenflonne12 Hey, I grew up with Duke Nukem, and I'm annoyed at DNF. It's an okay game, but the price point is way, way off for what it is
I know about the whole mechwarrior frnachise
anyone know what channel HUB is on with shaw cable?
I personally like Duke Nukem 3D
WOOT u go rarity
0um
Yes!
screw cable, i have satelite!
Whoa, noon already?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7BSgWG6Kw&NR=1
Well you can download it for free
If you'd like
Any good abandoned strategy games? Preferably ones that are unique?
and it's 294 for me i think
loved duke 3D all the way, as well i grew up with the old 2D games x3
smackdown shut your mouth and here comes the pain were and still are awesome
or 295
i dont even have a tv
@CircuitMane: Exactly, $30 is the most I'd be willing to pay for it.
Ivan, hold on
Screw TV, YT it!
Screw the hub, I have the internet!
even though rarity pals in comparison to pinkie pie
Wait wut
Civilization I
First of all
and i was 6 when those games came out x3
Oh Civ 1 and Two
XD
It's midnight, not noon.
Screw women, I have ponies...?
Civ II isn't abandonware
Derp.
actually
direcTV is 294
Well, I own Civ V so I wouldn't beable to enjoy it.
no.
Define "Strategy".
I'm apparently quite tired.
Took me forever to find out that mechassault isn't even considered canon =P the groups involved are practically nonexistent in the mechwarrior books with the exception of a little footnote mentioned in some book written back in 97 or something
xP
yeah
11This is Rarity's official vid.
Screw everything, I have ponies
Ivan, you're probably right
lol
YEAH
Too spoiled by my fancy animations
@Dee_Twenty actually I was thinking $40, but then I'd buy it used at that point so it would be $30 so yeah, kinda agree :)
mm... Yes unless they like ponies too
sounds about right
