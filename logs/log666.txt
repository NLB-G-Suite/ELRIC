The war areas are under magic protection

What's going on?
Well ok then.
And that traditional music plays in both maps of the Arks ship.
Holla everypony! :)
Frankly, it's got this traditional feel to it, but it's still as overly dissonant as any other song in the PSO2 OST
Dat shrug :D
am I right to assume that we're taken with the gameplay, thus no chatter? :D
I got games and Inception to look at!
Ohh, Inception! ^_^

CLASSY
I guess the trilogy events we had this summer were meant to prevent the IRC from dying out like this.
More like, to have something to do in summer.
Why do I feel like we're listening to Jazzified Banjo Kazooie songs. :D

There's never anything to discuss as far as best pony is concerned because inevitably someone says "Everypony is best pony :D" and then everyone else agrees with that.

Not the same one you're thinking of apparently.

oh, we had a rules page, whoda thunk it

hi
Who's breaking rules?
and how
13it's a feat that can only be managed by the most dedicated of grinders
Some people like to take baby steps.
:D
I have no idea, I'm just trying to match it up with GW2's quest XP curve.
this is the first time ive been on here :D
We can tell ;)

hi
Namely because it is.
13at least in tf2, while exceedingly unlikely, you can still get hosed by a day one player
Turned from best pony discussion to best PVP stratedgy. HUMANITY!
But nowadays in WoW the dedicated PvPers are generally kept in their own upper bracket.
i
Where's the fairness there?
hi
Well Rei you stop sucking and learn to play.
I'd think of kinder words to phrase that with but I'm not in the mood to.
13silly rei i am quite stoppable
i liked the pvp system in wow until cata. it took practice and experience, and then it was quite fun
I wandered into it, and on day one, I straight up assassinated a few dozen people. >_>
Hold on, I forgot the :P on the end of my last sentence.
And I am back
Lol
Since I used to play a rogue, yeah you can say that.

Can some one explain why Wrek's bar is all weird?
I only use DBM
Pfft, only use DBM.
Inception is weird O__o

Does anyone have talent advice for making a Retrobution Paladin?
I only plan on using it for questing

It takes awhile just to get to 86

Incidentally, while writing my case, I realized that GW2 is probably TOO easy to level in.
You can run 15 events at Lvl 79 and poof, you're Lvl 80. >_>

Ohoo this song :3
um no I don't rp
why not? ;o
http://i.imgur.com/jfSME.jpg
yep
thats where it turns from fandom, to obsession.
Not the most imposing title in the world is it.
the writing, characters, animation
especially the characters
watch a few episodes and see if you like it.
Its just a bunch of ponies right?
yep
hmm...
yes
and lots of $$$ into it.
Oh really? I might start researching it
xD
"Mothafucka." xD
But really, watch the first 5 episodes of season 1 and after that make a judgement if you like it or not.
The first 2 episodes are a bit difficult to get through, they seem a little girly to some people
I liked them though.

publicity spreads, free pr
Pony tags in JSR?
Damn, anyone got a spare sniper wep? Ill trade you backburner for it.
there's no downside to mentioning ponies
sorry for being quiet guys
Its best to buy them when they are on sale :)
it's an automatic win for the publishers
I think I've got a shahansha kicking around.
it's free marketing and free sales
we get the idea, you're going in loops
you're right.

I'm not into sad fics.
*it's hard to.
^
I doubt its actually going to happen though
a lot of announcements but not much happening...
i just keep recommending FO:E to everyone
it's a fanfic, but quality and story-wise, it's on par with many "real" books out there
FO:E?
but sadly I am not
it works great on its own
^
eh.
its worth a try
if I'm not interest I am not
just saying
O_O
MLD with characterization?
Maybe it won't be that horrible
welp, my sister uninstalled steam....:(
I figured it was you

08,01DerpyWhooves: how old are you?

08,01sub06905: everything
HMM. THAT'S SOME PERSONAL INFORMATION.
08,01whoops
08,01SpadeMagnes[R]: would you like the long answer?
it's not personal when millions of people are also that age :p
OMG CANZ I DO RDDDDDDDDD
MY AGE IS nein nein nein
And I dont buy that
Sorry.
He uses a Mac to boot
Extremely.
Very important.
Saturn do the long one!
go on
also
/me hugs Saturn
08,01SpadeMagnes[R]: mostly, it's the graphics card, but cpu and ram do also have an effect on framerate
Well, luckily he did. (Right?)
Yea he told me it doesnt matter how much cpu it has
08,01Chrysalis_: are you sure? i'm going to start talking about memory latency and associative caches...
I want WoW to be able to run at decent fps
The most i get is 12-17
The fps utterly tanks when alot of shit is on screen
08,01Chrysalis: for badly written games, yes
08,01Chrysalis: heh, aye; as i said, badly written games
Goodnight everyone :)
He was talking about the crack in her voice.
Tru dat.
Saturn iv yet to get an answer off you as to whether you control the bronyuk twitter
wow
How can he do that?
He just can.
please dont link to more stores, my bank account is looking rather sad
macs are bad at gaming becasue they horribly overprice their hardware
simple as that
08,01<3
And he says a mac wont break down as fast as other comps
i bought the luna off the store you linked the other day within about an hour of you linking it
Well all he uses it for is web browsing
*mac
dark_whorst?
Hay
Interview.
He's just like, "IDGAF"
Saturn nice
wow Saturn :O
Wha...?
quad 4.2GHZ, 250GB SSD 6870
that'S also why you dont go for mac if you want actual performance. buy the parts seperatly, you cans ave huge amounts of money
bout 4TB in HDDs
Saturn: also, got the details for that combination?
LOL!
08,01i7 3820, 16gb low latency ddr3 RAM, x79 motherboard, Radeon 7870, 1TB hdd, el-cheapo case, 800W power supply
I find myself spending a lot of money on power supplies because i dont want cheapo crap ones.
16 Ram is overdoing it right now
not bad. not bad at all
plan for next paycheck is to put maybe £300 into one
16gb of ram is dirt cheap you cant afford not to get it
05TheGreatAndPowerfulT i disagree
:)
Um.......okay?
I havent bought a copy of win7 ever
but multitasking could require more
see streamers
I have Vista...
Same here.
vista after the service packs isn't that bad.
Well, right now I'm using a crappy XP.
but I do like 7.
08,01and i found it in a bundle deal
08,01which meant i could up the graphics card to something nicer than originally planned
08,01

Hm?
I'm 16 and lack a job. how would I even do that
pinging
i tend to prefure dubs
Hey, do you guys know any good fanfictions?

Well, Metaknight
but I play Peach
MACHO
GRUBBA
He's proven to be the "best" character in brawl.
because of that FUCKING MOVEMENT
13rain rain <3
yep
0,14the trick is that how bad it is
<3
Brawl has EXTREME Inbalance
I was asleep all day :<
13:<
To be honest, I never understood why he's the "best" character. I still kick his butt. :D
^
0,14pfffft
METAL NIGHT IS BEST HE HAS A MASK AND A MISTERIOUS PAST
his moves are hard to avoid. and geto ut of he racks up damage fast and his finisher can catch you off guard.
Also hes is one of the few charactors with a counter move.
0,14you're always going to have that situation
Melee > Brawl
that is a defined fact
^
0,14it still happens
matchup is annoying, but =/= imbalance
13i blame tacos
No
I blame sxyprtndr
Melee > Brawl
shit i could go for some tacos
and I can proove why
0,14Yahooz on dat roll
PROOF!
Oh.
anybody else eat 40 volcano tacos in a row because they were hungry?
anybody?
1340?
13no..
...
I ate 14 in a row
tekken 5:dark resurrection didnt seem to have much imbalance, a lot of characters were pretty equal
I regreted it later
I tried, but had to stop at 39
/me 13does not handle spice well
man, them volcano tacos are good
I've eaten 4 in a row but no more.
i haven't had em since those 40 though

13SSTV
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Mz0t3MjBA
13SSTV is a format for converting a picture into sound
the mares at my school dont stand a chance;)
13ARG players worked out they were SSTV transmissions, decoded into pictures that spun off into all kinds of weird ways
If you converted them into a imgae you got spoilers
hm....
13so bumming around the BMS files i came across the odd man out qecode.mp3 (everything else is wav), and lo and behold it was SSTV
13threw it into the decoder and got a piece of the ARG i didn't know was happening :3
Back to my music report. :D
13not valve this time though :3
Texas.
13valve hasn't learned how to manage ARGs either
13it was solved in hours
I'll probably move up north after I graduate.
cool
13well yes

I played thaat when I was 5

11,02I understood today that Phospholipids consist of two fatty acids that are estericized to a backbone molecule, typically Gylcerol, that then has a group attached to the third carbon molecule that is the Phosphate group and then attached to a head group that differs and identifies the specific phospholipid type :D
For science~

/me stills needs to read a fanfic

Celestia is not a monster, dammit
I've never read one.
:/
I Think Rainbow Dash And Applejack Make A Good Pair...
I don't ship.
But if you do, more power to you.
lol
It's not my style.
Nothing much.
If I were to ship anything, which I don't, but, y'know, from an outside perspective looking in, Rainbow and Pinkie seem like a reasonable ship (well, most ships are reasonable but)

:(
well, I have the strength of a dictatoral ruler, the fairness and benevolence of a democracy, and the authority to controll business like a communist
pretty neat http://youtu.be/4Oku3aG839A
I'd also argue that benevolence isn't really a part of democracy, just a common (but hardly inevitable) product of it
o.o
hello every pony
hey dude
hows it going?
good i owe a mate 40$
hey lighttrooper
i was just wondering y
Hey is there a stream up?
No stream
No problem.
no offense i like her just not as much as say pinkie or dasie
THat's okay.
Well, no really hates her either.
She's just not really an attention grabber like the other 5.
<3 http://mlpchan.net/pony/src/1346641466671.jpg <3
If you don't mind me asking, why do you call her best pony?
I dont have a favorite pony
Are we talking about how Applejack is underrated as a character or something?
Ping.
And now you did :3
Ikr. :D
About Applejack, she certainly stood out from her intro from my point of view.
pinged where?
NO WHERE!
LOOK AWAY!
:P
I can see that as well.

SHe's also the most down to eath pony in terms of the mane 6.
/me Cuddles Her Rainbow Dash Picture
:D
^
Really? :D I recognizied him immediately :D
It's because of the hair, right?
Even if it was our least favorite.
Mostly, yeah. Also, non-purple skin.
If I could live in equestria I would drop all my plans
She looks a little more G1 in that
:)
brb, require food
IMO
y cant i see streem wait is there a streem
Pinkie Pie is best pony
Rainbow Dash is the best pony
If I were in Equestria, Twilight would be my bestest best friend in the whole wide world :)
Crackle's cousin, you mean?
Derpy Is Cutest
She also cheated.
Pinkie Pie is the cutest. :p
*too
think I might either play ME3 multiplayer or GW2
Or the judges were just plain idiots. -_-
but yer it was unfair
what's all this?
you people talking about how rainbow horse blatantly cheated and then cheated again when she agreed to play fairly?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9opnsHQppc
that's horrific
I wish.
alright, defend the cheating rainbow horse
I'm not defending her.
I condemn her.
not like she purposefully broke rules to ensure victory or anything
I'm fine with them staying ponies, IMO.

And honestly, I think you'll find most people here are very open minded to those sort of things.
Granted, you'll be able to tell when they arn't.
I prefer women, but if you prefer other genders I honestly don't mind. :)
