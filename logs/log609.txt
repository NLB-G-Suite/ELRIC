there probably won't ever be as incredible a series as lord of the rings. Tolkein literally invented fantasy as a genre as weknow it
everything you know and think of with 'fantasy' comes from tolkein

MUST we watch ALL the credits?

05,15This is an awesome way to end my summer.
whichisfunny because lotr isa lot older then star wars
LOTR was published in the 1940s
As opposed to, you know, Star Wars.

Tolkein invented middle earth while he was fighting in world war1
You were just at the right place, Rohan:)

hi
By the end, I'm basically smiling by reflex and looking right through them.
HA HA HA YUMMY BRAINS!
So...is there anything goin' on? All I see is buffering.
hey everypony!
Most of them are pretty understanding, especially if I have the "please don't hurt me I'm new" sign.

Is anyone streaming ?
<Polydunami> Oh okay thanks for telling me
That works too.

That works assuming the ghast don't blow it to bits.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf5ukMJO2cY&feature=plcp
Noted for future referance.
I thought ghasts hurl explosives?
They do, but apparently.
<AJIsAwesome> Exacliburrrrrrr
No worries :D

As long as there's something between you and them they won't shoot anyway.
Which interestingly enough, they cannot do through glass.
oh lookie people :)

I'm watching "Whose Line"
I had a rather exhausting week
I'm watching Music Movies
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg0vrP4h88c&feature=related

Sound would bounce right off of glass, I think.
I like Hunchback quite a LOT

I have yet to ever encounter slime.
I have yet to encounter most mobs.
already found 3 slimes
and they are rare
I've only seen the standard overworld mobs, one ghast, and a horde of pigmen.
but I like it
Hold on; EVEN Japan?

Literally. I think I may have hobbit-esque inclinations.
BRB.
no
Clearly you need to build a proper hobbit hole.
i think you can
I do not think it is possible to
Yes. I ought to find another Extreme Hills biome and create one.
That ought to stave off the urge to bury myself inside the nearest hole.

1,11I'm in college at the moment and i'm actually doing my internship for it. Sorta why I'm usually not here sans BMN's and special streams.
it's gonna be around 150 dollars to get it to Norway
I'm entering high school this year xP
11,01Silverscreen: Past Sins.
1,11Yeah, Past Sins.
Entering college this year.
The End.

I want to read Past Sins
Is it possible to sneeze while taking a piss?
I'm goign to start reading The Divine Comedy.
Past Sins is like, a requirement for fanfic readers...
Go all Fluttershy on us!
:P
alegr0 forgive and forget
Dang, I use LAT all the time
I use it too, but I used it before the show
It used to be a tactic to piss off trolls on /b/
A jerkdick?

Or a dickjerk?
Dicktits, wooohoo
No one follows it anyway
:D
jerkdick! lol

0,14'sup everyone?
11,01"We" is plural first person.

1,11Silverscreen cannot speak in third person unless he is in the middle of an RP. Becuase it's f**king hard to do.

11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: K. I might actually have sprays working.
Merciful mungbeans!!!!!!
1,11I've seen it. You don't want to. Trust me.
Voice cracking a bit?
alegrobot have you ever gambl
11,01Adding sprays doesn't even add the spray.

OOOHHH MYYYYY

You scare me lol
11,01Sprays not working still :<
OHHH MYYYYYYYY
1,11My least favorite Mane 6 member? That's a tough one. It's a toss up between Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Applejack's personality is too flat and she needs more screen time. I don't like Rainbow Dash because she reminds me too much of the jackass jocks that I had in my school, even if she does have a hidden heart. :/
Gigabit Oooh my bad.
Only BBBFF song has grown on me, oh wait, CMC song
........
Ok, thats enough. Goodnight all. Have a good ome/
0,14>Best song
oh my
BBBFFF
but there's more than just that
I don't like competition, which is why I dislike Rainbow Dash
0,14ya'll crazy
Saxy: Inorite.
1,11Let me rephrase that: She needs more stories involving her.
0,14AWWWWWWWWW
0,14YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
00,02we need 3 more players
0,14FIGHTING IS MAGIC
RD is overated
00,02MvM

I like Twilight Sparkle's theme :)
Is that the name of the podcast? The Robronies? Dang :P
00,02nyx.ariscop.net
/me continues the song
emails?
I like Applejack because I find her the most supportive and openly caring for her friends. Rainbow Dash is too brash and blunt for me.
dayum
00,02normal password
Awww....
you sure man?
1,11No pun intended. XD
+Phase4 did you add me
lol
Applejack's a great character, no doubt about that. But she's too stable to be explored effectively.
MLP_M1KE13
YES
WELL THAT MADE MY NIGHT
I am out of questions
Which of the Mane 6 you hope to see more in character development in Season 3?
I never really had any
Baaaaaaaaaaaaane
...............
Worst mane 6 pony?
Stream problems
is there such a thing as a worst mane 6?
No, Cypress, there isn't.
Well that can't end well.
11,01pony_9790: is best pony.
worst mane six is still best pony
?
Okay. I'll change my name right now
i didn't like them :/
Rainbow Dash...
lol
He left
or not
Dude
now he is back
AppleJack development
and song while were at it
More Applejack
fluttershy the best
I guess we'll know when we see episode 3 of season 3
00,02TheKoreanBrony1354, i did
Where?
...Wut.
pinkie pie should
It's kind of weird. I like hiding my nick lol
Fluttershy has had the least amount of screen time IIRC
+Phase4 can i join you
0,14same way that Allegro and Gigabit are with A/V department
00,02TheKoreanBrony1354, sure
coool
I would like to see more of RD
Makes sense.
We actually have departments now?
i would like to see less of RD
And here I thought those were just names.
Heh, no problem :)
had them for a while.
0,14Yeah
they give her too much screentime
Could you guys please reply to the email I sent you two weeks ago, since I missed last week's show?
Well, I've never actually seen them in action.
00,02TheKoreanBrony1354, ponies
That's all.
I think Pinkie Pie has donew enough
Please?
*done
No one has except the people in them.
hehehe
0,14btw, how have the podcasts been going? I've never been able to catch 'em aside from now
lol
She's a typical whiner kid
but-- I still kinda like her
More MvM anyone? one of Phases other servers.
theyve been going well
har
1,11The only development from her was the Family Appreciation Day, and even that was more development for Granny Smith than for Applebloom.
I would like to see more Twilight and Celestia information
Been a while
:3
PIE HOLE
?
Twilight is shown too much
he*
0,14>_>
Hello everypony :P
There are signs, but there can be a side story for a much more deeper character development
1,11We don't need anymore Pinkie Pie episodes, and we've had enough Rarity episodes.
I would like to see more Applejack episodes in Season 3, she is the only Mane 6 pony thats doesnt has her own song.
Could you guys please reply to the email I sent you two weeks ago, since I missed last week's show?
1,11VenHur: YES!
and i was there~
0,14XD
Wait, 3
lol
1,11I want an Applejack Song! I have a feeling she'd sweep us away with a cute slow-country song.
:D
voice4meh?
I do want 2 pinkie and 2 Rarity episodes, but there's onl 13 this time
maybeh?
0,14=P
maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybeh?
Rarity and Applejack need more screentime
. . .

Lol thanks, Derpy.
1,11Applejack needs a family-focused episode that reveals how she sees the mane 6 as an extended family, and while she's deeply rooted to her family and traditional ways, she learns that going outside of tradition isn't always a bad thing. A semi-sad song would be included.
is he takin' a shit?
I know it isn't a mane 6, but Spike's parents should be explored

GODDAMIT
Trixie annoys me.
Wrong Derpy
LOL TAB FAIL
I tab-failed
I find Trixie has her place.
The fandom's need to make her more than she is is the only thing that annoys me.
like I always do
dat trixie disccusion seems to appear every now and then
Where is the tab key in this?

I hate fandom.
But
Now.. sleep or tf2...
Hrmmmm..

Why must I smell like fish?
11,01sub06905: Sure.
To be fair
:)
TO BE FAIR
i hit people with it when they're being hipocrits
I'm not writing it off my own ideas.
\
Well, I'm going to do it well.
The problem is that the fandom sees things in Trixie that aren't there to begin with.
good, its hard to find a good trixie fic
I'm rewriting it for the second time.
i've not found one that isnt trixie/twi shipping
:D
Argh
Raggle fraggle.
Pinkie pie is watching you sleep
Anyway

Why?

Okay
Let's see if I can explain this.

But its taking its time :(
Phase4.exe has stopped working.
And it's actually Episode 3: Twilight.

I thought they cancelled episode 3 twilight
By the way
alright, time for this pony to rest up. Thanks for tuning in and I'll see you guys later!
*posters
Evidently.
Also the mane6 get involved at some point.
At the beginning.
Before I rekindle my murderous rage at people I don't know,
I won't explain all of it because it's full of plotholes and stupid.
but you could make everything else interesting
Sec
I'm getting to that bit
And insights :3
What've you got against Twixie shipping?
A GOOD SHOW BEING BROADCASTED IN BOOMERANG?
Also he wanted to give Trixie a massive and meaningless power boost.
/me blindly hits go to Cartoon Network
I'll get to Meanwhile's point in a bit.
Now
that a good show?
Oh, I thought it was the actual movie
cachi01|mobile:they show some old show son boomerang..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhsCp5HgxSk Twilightliscious
aww, if only I had cable ;_;
Six chapters in, just recently, I decided I don't like it anymore.
My end goal is to tell a story from two fronts.
We've got Hawaii Five-O and Cannon
or i'm getting mixed with other fic
The other half of the story is Trixie's end.
oh
She has to relearn how to distinguish between illusion and reality.
Specifically, her own self-illusions.
We should play Family Feud!
Oh, and we have Bonanza and Gunsmoke
*satisfying
hmmm
It is illusion.
Trixie becomes mistress of illusion.
no
Do it
Its hilarious
13any ponies for mvm?
Now now, it's one answer at a time :)
eh i'll join
And then there are bits like how all reality is percieved, and if Trixie is to be the illusionist than she must be aware of the reality, and that Trixie is the only one able to see the truth
*like
Pinkie Pie!

I feel like such a retard.
gooby pls
Hey Everypony
Well, it makes sense.
I don't know if anyone's explored the idea fully yet, though.
Right now? Illusionist Trixie has been cliché since the character appeared.
Or competently.
Mistress of Illusion, thanks much.
I'm taking the idea to another level, I like to think.

yeah same here
Oh
I would get TF2, but don't want to overburden this laptop anymore
Look, has anyone actually completely explored the relationship between illusion and reality using Trixie as a vehicle?
I was just playing MvM :P
In most fics, I find, it's all just about powers.
I need a keyboard that supports rollover before I play TF2
rollover?
^
It's shallow.
For me it would be the [;'\ keys :P
And that's about all there is to say on the matter.

HOW DO YOU MAKE ANIMATIONS ON DAT
S3 episode
WTF is dat
Then HL3 reveal trailer
I missed the last 10 minutes.
My user name is odd...
I just don't see it happening.
ehhh is mostly the rival thing that every anime seems to have
Did they ask any more questions?
no
Trixie is not Twilight's rival.
Don't you dare suggest that.
este burrito esta muy bueno pero le falta salsa verde
rival antagonist enemy whatever term you like
Twilight herself has dismissed the notion.
they've been standing around for about 10 minutes now
my english is not good enough to explain myself fully
Thanks. Aw man. I would've loved to have said goodbye.:'(

11,01I could use more strange weapons. I thought you could only buy strange weapons.
The inverse of a rice cooker, basically.

A rice uncooker?
which is essentially buying them...
errr... buy as in trade
I always just trash my crates.
either way, off to try and make a rainblower!
okay guys I'm out
it's 1 am
In terms of utility.
Strange weapons can be found by opening crates with keys. You can buy the keys in the Mann Co. Store or via Trading. The crates come in random drops or via trading.
Cya*
11,01I traded a flaming crate for 3 strange weapons.
11,01I know how crates work.

how much pure money did Valve make off of that item?
That's okay, such confusion tends to be normal around me at this hour.
because we're idiots like that <_<
Nothing
11,01Sad truth about gamers: The average gamer is a terrible consumer.
it's purely cosmetic
valve released an item to the store
for $100 - "Something Special for Someone Special"
and it pops up a message across all serves about the exchange
that's it.
11,01I'm not saying anyone here is an average gamer.
the one that makes you bald.
I know
11,01consumer.
Dat dancin' pinkeh.
fine
11,01I heavily vote with my wallet for example.
I just wanted to point out I wasn't average.
to the "srs" gamer, yes
to valve, it was absoultely brilliant
11,01The avg. gaming consumer is way too open with theirs.
Probably nothing
Valve knows their hat Simulator 2012 audience.
Well there goes my conspiracy theory....
11,01Most publisher know their audience...as cash cows with loose teets.
THEN start dumping into sapper
0,14heh
0,14Teets
Dem teets
Dollar signs.
11,01That's fine except when that thinking leads to highly-unethical business practices.
which I am
Sapper can be maxed out by the end of the second wave if you're good at collecting cash, but to each his own, I guess
yu gi oh is still around?
despite having a couple years to go
i ahven't seen a yu-gi-oh card since the thousand eyes relinqush thing was
