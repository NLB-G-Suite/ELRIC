these were more judgemental times. anything not "normal" is looked upon with scorn by man.
/me hugs gollums
MrBen: You'll see why.
Yes no hard feelings whatsoever...
no hard feelings killyoukillyoukillyoudamnhobit not at all
No hard feelings, ata all>_>
AJIsAwesome: I pretty much already know.
Combustiblelemons: he would strangle you and take the ring

sauron is now mad
MrBen: Allright.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The battle at Helm's Deep was edited down from twenty hours of footage, shot over a 4 month period with the rain machine battering down on the cast.
i don't have the ring >.>
Sam=Twilight, i knew X was evil
Sauron BE AAAAAAANGRY
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gandalf's line near the end declaring that "The Battle of Helm's Deep is over; the Battle of Middle Earth is about to begin" is paraphrased from part of one of Winston Churchill's most famous speeches of the Second World War, of June 18th 1940: "...the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin."
and... To Be Continued
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: There were so many extras used in the sequences at Helms Deep, and the filming went on for so many months that almost all the extras and principal actors got t-shirts reading "I survived Helms Deep". There were so many of these shirts that extras would often meet other extras in New Zealand's main cities because they would recognize the shirts.
dat buffer
Fl00ter41: And potted plants are prisoners!
well...you lose
HA
:O
That would be an awesome shirt
wow XD
...
I want that shirt.
Dont you just hate it when people quote "my preasious" but they don't know his name?
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene where Aragorn has washed up on the shore of the river that he fell in, the dialogue was originally in English. But Liv Tyler was entranced by the Elvish language, and since both characters and actors knew how to speak it, she talked Peter Jackson into letting them translate the script for that scene. Everyone agreed that it turned out much better her
1,11way than the way it had been originally planned.
Do the credits last 5 days like Fellowship of the Ring
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Body count: 468
No way it's that low.
05,15Hell yeah Sam
the elvish parts are pretty cool
any one up for an orc eating contest then
Man, this movie. It's been too long.
I'm gona go now just to watch the first one now, BYE!
The orcs had 10k troops, didn't they?
pikoRing: Gardens are extermination camps1
Gimli don't you mean 10468?
Gimli, still not as much as Hot Shots: Part Deux :)
smeagle is having issues
bye!
Dat Blue wall of text 0.0

....
Or is that the number of actors required to achieve the effect of that battle?
lol
...
poor smeagol :'( he is just mis-understood
he can't break the wood
05,15It's the number of deaths that you actually see on screen
05,15I think
:'( smeagol dont do it

EPIC GOLLUM TIME

YesNONO
Gollum is Tardy again
SHElob
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Peter Jackson and producer Barrie M. Osborne actively campaigned for Andy Serkis to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Gollum. Academy regulations, however, forbid an actor to be nominated when he is not physically to be seen on screen, despite Serkis' active input into the role.
thanks for reminding Gollum of giant spider Faramir
That feeling when you talk to yourself.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Rendering Gollum would often take six hours for one shot, so WETA would leave the shot to render over night and check the results in the morning. Every now and again a computer glitch would occur, for instance, one morning the team woke up to find every hair on Gollum's head standing upright in a sort of punk looking afro, or his eyes would pop in and out of his
1,11head as he spoke.
Smeagol sounds like a great plan
dont do it
Love this shot
:(
/me WE love Frodo......we love him NO! WE HATE HIM WE HATE HIM!!!!! Oh.......I'm TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDYY

Azuredragon wonderful! *claps* xD
10/10
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: It was clear to the writers from the very beginning that the entire final sequence of the third novel would be not be a part of this film, but open the third. Also, the confrontation with a defeated Saruman at Isengard was deemed to be too anti-climatic, and therefore moved to the third film as well. This tactical move meant the battle for Helms Deep became this
Half an hour of credits incoming / 10
1,11film's natural climax.
this signals beddtime i think

Bye Sergio_Scriptor
10/10

so retunr of the king tomorrow?
BRB, guys. Have to get dog food.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Though this is the film that carries the title of the middle volume, scenes from the book "The Two Towers" are actually spread across all three films. Boromir's death scene and funeral, and the beginning of Aragorn's pursuit of the Orcs, made up the first chapter of the book, but were used at the end of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Scenes
1,11after the Battle of the Hornburg (Helm's Deep), up to the part where Gandalf sets out with Pippin towards Minas Tirith, were moved toThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, as were all scenes involving Frodo and Sam up to the part where Frodo is captured by Orcs.
I slept through way too much of it. Mom did her best to fill in what she could, but frankly I don't even know WHAT needs to be filled in.

Everypony walk the dinosuar!!!!!!!!!!
I can't believe I thought LotR was for nerds and geeks.
MLP EPISODE NEXT
WOO HOO
mdl actually, this is a very good adaptation of a novel
1,11Correction: Physically, he didn't play the character of GOLLUM. He played the Hobbit of Smeagol. It was too short of a role to warrant an oscar. (fucking copouts)
MDL: Because if he doesn't like these films, he doesn't know what the hell he's on about.
I just mist LotR? OH COME ON
05,15Yeah, the Academy Awards are bullshit
LOTR is the latest addition to epic literature
Dumblewhore: Will you stream that song They're Taking The Hobbits To Isengard after the credits?

fluttershyFTW: WE ARE WATCHIING MLP EPISODE NEXT
1,11SILVERSCREENS MOVIE REVIEW: Just like the first film, this was a great adaptation to a great book. I haven't even atempted to read Two Towers, but from what I've seen, what's left out or replaced was done so with good reason and smoothed over very well. Another 10/10 from me.
Fl00tersh41: Well I'm out of ideas.
OohShiny: Yep.
PillowPoni so the show sucked in that time
Dang, I'm late D:
mmk
I saw no two towers in the same shot 5/10

there probably won't ever be as incredible a series as lord of the rings. Tolkein literally invented fantasy as a genre as weknow it
Gimli: So do I! : D
after seeing this film again and re-living the joy of watching it, i've decided to get the books. should be good fun.
Gimli: who were you yesterday i missed the movie
Thanks ShadowQuill- anone have any ideas what time the film is?
everything you know and think of with 'fantasy' comes from tolkein
Gimli: Saw that image before.
Gimli: Seems legit

Where was Gondor?/10
I think
AlienWarhead: :D
Dumblewhore: I thought the same thing about them. Changer her mind and make her watch them with you
also, dammit I missed most of it :P
lotR was this generation's Star Wars.
where was gondor when we needed to fin waldo
but I already own the extended cuts on BR so I don't mind
1,11Dumblewhore: To be fair, if you aren't into fantasy movies, then it would seem really uninteresting and tedius.
OohShiny: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929632/
MUST we watch ALL the credits?
find*
05,15This is an awesome way to end my summer.
whichisfunny because lotr isa lot older then star wars
DocSane LotR is older than star wars
OohShiny It is from a movie called precious
I missed the ending, I knew that sliced cucumber was too good to be true :P
...wait a sec. Did I miss The Two Towers?
why does everyone care where was Gondor , what about me D:
hey everypony what i miss
Dumblewhore: if it was Doctor Who your erection would have been seen from space...
LOTR was published in the 1940s
Dumblewhore: Yeah, I have to be honest, I thought they were boring too before I really watched them here. But the last time I tried to watch them was when I was 8.
As opposed to, you know, Star Wars.
lolRohan
therainbowvortex: everything
Tolkein invented middle earth while he was fighting in world war1
You don't have any friends, Rohan, nobody likes you

We're nearly half way through
But the food we've stored is running out, and we can't grow in this cold >_>
Rohan: When did they come?
*credits
Gimli: I'm....not sure I can agree. This film is pretty much the definition of a great film. Well developed, lots of action where it counts, and everything is executed well. The only sort I can imagine getting bored of these films are the kinds who can't stand it if something doesn't explode every 3-5 minutes in the movie.

WHY ISN'T THIS A JOKE?
Oh what riveting tales these are!
Desktop Ponies again
THIS IS HELL
how is she moving the mouth
How does that work?
how did she do that
THIS IS TARTARUS I SAY
I'm actually enjoying this.
05,15This...honestly isn't that bad
how she moves the puppet mouth?
They seem to grow thumbs whenever they're wearing gloves.
Again, this cartoon is so...lazy.
IT. IS. ON.
Did I hear right? Was here name BON BON?
Eh this isn't hell it is more like a lecture class that you don't want to be in.
Let's mute it and have a G4 conversation
ShadowQuill: Tartarus isn't this enjoyable
PM Me when its over
ohno, ghost stories:o
desertman2: I see
05,15How come those two get a bed
how did she grab the door knob?
magic
It's not terrible, but it's incredibly boring.
giggle at the ghosties
Fl00tersh41: You're right, it's more enjoyable...
0.0
It's important to see where FiM came from.
GHOST STORIES
well, at least its not G3
You're dead serious aren't you. You're going to show the whole damn thing aren't you. I knew streamers could be cruel but I never imagined you being inmumane
Sumica who is streaming?
The headless horse!
05,15<=====better than G4
^
die Fluttercry
Look before you sleep
G4 is a comination of G1 and G2.
g2 has no peisi or unicorns
nothing is better than G4
i just noticed are there even any unicorns... pegasus
Fluttercry: WHAT THE BUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU
Dazzle? isn't that a DotA hero?
what generation is this?
Shining Armor?
All earth ponies in this town.
Fluttercry: i disagree. But ALMOST as good.
G3
Basil of Baker Street
05,15Ssssshhh. Do you hear that? That's the sound of jimmies being rustled
While this is going on, I'm going to watch the new Game Grumps.
^
They had alicorn aliens in an episode, though.
PFFFFT

/) Fluttercry
Rescue at the midnight Castle
FLUTTERSHY COULD DO THAT
Basel Faulty?
05,159\
if he wants to be a knight, she shouldn't have been named Squire
I SAY THIS IS A DEATH TREAT STREAMER
05,15too lazy to hit shift
To be fair it could be worse. It could be G3... or did I just give the streamer ideas
it's Link
there arent any unicorns are pegasi in this?
This isn't terrible, but they're all carbon copy cut-out. They don't have unique personalities and quirks.
and he ded
ERgh
how is this supposed to be a GHOST story?
STILL NOT SCARY
AND THEY ALL DIED THE FUCKING END
no, it's prince adam
wtf.
05,15G3.5 after this.
05,15It must be done
NOOOOOOOOO
wait.. wasn't this supposed to be a ghost story? Why is there dragons instead of ghosts in it then?:s
I'm now imagining a self-important, sarcastoc Basil Fawlty dragon.
Fluttercry, Nooo
OH GOD NO
NOOOOO!!
Yes
Then man door hand hook car door.
fuck i'm going
TRUE STORY
its SPIKE
Ghost dragons.
05,15THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU REQUEST PONIES
So?
^
Hey, we're watching G3 ponies? cool :D
Fluttercry: the world's biggest tea party? ^^
Please don't
but the rainbow one kicked me
Inb4 manup.jpg
true:S
i will never request ponies again
somepony_else = somehow, I still think this is a little less gay than Prince Adam
It's Ghost! He IS a shape shifting reptilian!
Fluttercry: Can we have G3.6 instead? *puppy eyes*
ded
G3.5? I can stomach that.
my god firefly has no wings!!
AND THEN SQUIRE GOT EATED AND EVERYPONY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER
*cries blood*
What a terrible story.
you're bad at telling stories
http://derpy.me/ZiPT4
05,15I think people exagerate about the quality of the old gens
That was scary?
COOL STROY BRO
has all of the stream begun to like seaponies?
WHAT A STORY MARK
Still a better horror story than Twilight. Wait...
Pony Land...
That's a ghost story?
THIS SCARY STORY IS A BASIC EPISODE OF G4
still a better ending than ME3
Tamazarashi you're right
dat soundtrack
See, nothing about this requires them to be ponies.
desertman2: Of course. That dragon was Ghost, the shape-shifting reptilian!
dont get your parents , the "fearless" squire will run away......WHAT ?
There's nothing wrong with the shame of the old gen, however the colour scheme... Yuk!
AND THEN THE PLANE WENT INTO A TALSPIN N' CRASHED INTO A HILSIDE AND EXPLODED INTO A FIREBALL AND EVERYPONY DIED!! D:
Except for me...
Fluttercry: I am not exaggerating
Replace them with random girls and it's exactly the same.
you know hy?
song
song:o
and then suddenly out of nowhere...THE HEADLESS HORSE APPEARED!!!!!
/me sings along
*facedesk*
'Cause I had my tray table up,
Pinkie, where are you?
still a basic episode of G4
AND ON THE DOOR KNOB.... WAS A HOOK!!
mare door hoof hook cart door
They're so bipedal
When I was a little filly and the sun was goin doooooown...
This awkward blast from the past does beg an interesting question; what do you think G5 ponies would be like.
Kandarihu: I hate the bipedalism.
^
and my seat back in full upright position D:
this song is quite good
Kandarihu: And the lazy song writing.
GIGGLE AT THE GHOSTIES
PinkiePieYoshi64: ALBAQUERQUE??!!
Riders they'll be the same cos G4 is the best
not so bad
Riders: Probably like G5, but not as good.
So.. was giggle at the inspired by this song?
Albuqurque
ShadowQuill: Eeyup :D
AJIsAwesome you from the future?
giggle at the ghosties*
lol opal
PinkiePieYoshi64: WE DON'T HAVE ANY BEAR CLAWS
Riders: Considering the fact that G4 left a huge impact on the MLP franchise.

I'm still laughing at the Snopp Dogg gif!
ShadowQuill: but I wanna LIVE! To see S3 fo G4!

Not even the SMOOZE CAN RESIST DA BUFFER!!!!!
DB_Brony: Like the live show?
DB _Brony G1 is okay actually
wait, its over?
see guy's, we survive the horror!!
Midnight Castle, please
like the whole movie night?
....
I almost wish it was as bad as G3. At least than I would have felt anger and frustration. This was just, meh. It's like the many shity cartoons in the transition from 80s to 90s
G1 is not that bad, but the animation does not make it cute
Can we watch Courage the Cowardly dog? :3
Desertman2: No :|
G1 had no idea what it wanted to be.
/me lays down in the fireplace
PinkiePieYoshi64 second that idea!
:D
Twilight Sparkle has the consistency to be the worst villain Equestria has ever seen. Think about it: Element of Magic, extremely STRONG magic, she would be terrifying
Also, the main characters never solve a single problem themselves.
/me tries not to shoot him self
ill be back
/me makes an evil inator
ShadowQuill Shining Armor is more powerful
DocSane Midnight Castle is the only good episode before G4
HUZZAH STREAM DIED AND I GET BOOBS FOR ADVERTISEMENTS
hmm
he casts a spell shield over a fucking big city
stop the buffer
I'm out bronies. I've got a big move tomorrow and a lot of preparations to make if I'm going to watch the stream from my New Apartment tomorrow.
good bye everyponn
/me shoots shining armor and twilight with the evil-inator
OohShiny: I think that's all he can do. Twi is a multi-power user.
OohShiny, but shield spells is /all/ he can do
goodnight everypony
MUAHAHAHAHAHA
Fluttercry: NOOOO
Bye Riders
Riders: Bye! Hope you have a good move!

I liked the ponies that you showed us. >_> <_<
-.-
I didn't like it, didn't hate it though
im in the neutral
>_> I didn't say anthing.... <_< what do you mean I said Batman must die?
didnt like it or hate it
as Saberspark said in ballad of the brony, it's not that bad
just plain boring
OohShiny: Just boring and bland.
LOL with the maze advert I wrote penis. I'm so mature.
:$
05,15You know what's awesome? Ad Block Plus
05,15NO ADS
I seriously can't sit through ANY episode of G3. It's that bad.

AJIsAwesome try G3.5
Fluttercry: But about all of my ads are filled with boobs!
is anything planned for the stream?
Try 3.6
Fluttercry: It's awessome! Started useing it about 2 weeks ago, and surfing has been faster without the loading of ads :D
05,15But that misrepresents our site ;__;

04What IS important, however, is that while I was out grocery shoping next door I noticed a woman and her shirt made me do a double take
sorry shadow
just a favor for the fellow brony
Ghosties: why?
Ghosties, really?
Ghosties: tell us WHY!
otakon, why do you think?
Pony shirt
:)
:P
A girl in my class wore a Rainbow Dash shirt, and I was too shy to ask...
Oh a pony shirt
Ghosties: Pony shirt right? O.O
Cliff Hanger
DAMMIT ShadowQuill
I was thinking of something else
OMG

trackerzod: Quickly mutating strain of deadly virus
Squallken: GREAT YTP

Ghosties: Sweet :3
I met a little girl that caught the 20% Cooler shirt I was wearing.
04I was pretty amused and surprised, I never thought I'd see someone in my neck of the woods wearing a FiM shirt
NullMaidix do you mean the Friendship Cannon?
Save Derpy is a sad video...
Did she notice your double take? :P
@shadowQuill it took some time to find it

04Oh, and later she was behind me in the line and she had a case of corona beer
Example-
Quick_Thinker: there was just an ice cream truck parked outside the neighbor's house for like 15 minutes while all the children at their block party bought ice cream... I was considering the thought of walking out while eating from my half-gallon of bruster's I have in the freezer

linsett: You don't need to put < and > between our nick names you only need to type the nick like this Ponies47

Polydunami: Lucky. Wish I came here sooner.
Tired in general or you been doing something strenuous?

Ponies47 Okay then thanks
TheKoreanBrony1354: What's your name on there?

For whatever reason, five-hour shifts are more strenuous than both six- and four-hour shifts.
linsett: No prob :P

/me runs over MALK with a train
Shadow If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve I'd have come here sooner and never leave.............Yes. I, Love, Everythiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!

<Polydunami> I like this site, but I don't understand how movie nights work. The newletter says Despicable Me, and they show Lord of the Rings.
So sit back my dear, and if it's all the same
hi
just sit back and relax, WHILE I EAT YOUR BRAINS!
By the end, I'm basically smiling by reflex and looking right through them.
AJIsAwesome: :D
hi SuperBrony64
More to the point people who are twonks.
Did I say that, linsett?
HA HA HA YUMMY BRAINS!
Dat Allegr0
So...is there anything goin' on? All I see is buffering.
hi Allegr0
hey everypony!
Most of them are pretty understanding, especially if I have the "please don't hurt me I'm new" sign.
SuperBrony64
OohShiny: SHUT UP STOP QUOTING THAT
Yay hi Allegr0
OohShiny naaa naaa naa gonna eat your braiinss
Sup Allegr0
Hey Allegr0! Wazzup? :P
>make it in to the nether >get attacked as soon as you appear
Bad OohShiny!
TheKoreanBrony1354: Yesh? :)
hi Leadhoof. There will be stream in 15 minutes
Oh hey Allegr0
ShadowQuill I like that song
Ponies47 nm, getting ready for the show :)
did yous add me
Allegr0, what's up!
Okiedokie. Thank you.
That's pretty much the nether in a nutshell T.
and i forget to carry arrows
Will there be a stream>
Congrats, Trix. Welcome to the Nether.
I'm not home o.o TheKoreanBrony1354
<Polydunami> Yeah....but can somepony plz explain how that works?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRdlGr8UO8
ohh
You'll get seen by a ghast and there goes your health bar.
I can usually deal with the Nether in steel gear and running fast.
The newsletter is not working at the moment, linsett.
MALK: I like MAD magazine more
I deal with it by playing on creative mode.
Is anyone streaming ?
Allegr0: Sweet. I'm happy because my father is allowing to install Steam on his computer which is great because now I get to play Steam games on a much better and faster computer. I still haven't play MvM yet.
Fluffle_Puff: HELL NAW
<Polydunami> Oh okay thanks for telling me
i carried a lot of stone so i build a house around my portal
That works too.
hi Fluffle_Puff not for another 15 minutes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ-CaLiXGp8
That works assuming the ghast don't blow it to bits.
ShadowQuill magazines arent on youtube
Another valid point.
Also, linsett, you don't need to type in the brackets around my name. Makes people think I was the one who said that.
can't destroy stone
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf5ukMJO2cY&feature=plcp
MALK: ...I know
/me wonders if SuperBrony64 actually put the luna cutie mark on his flank :D
Bronysith: I LOVE SOUL EATER
Noted for future referance.
I thought ghasts hurl explosives?
Polydunami Oh I'm sorry I keep on doing that....
not enough to destroy stone
They do, but apparently.
AJIsAwesome: so do i ... SYMETRY
BronySith
<AJIsAwesome> Exacliburrrrrrr
No worries :D
:3
As long as there's something between you and them they won't shoot anyway.
Build a castle in the Nether to hold back the hellspawn.
linsett: FOOL
linsett: I AMMA LOOKING FOR HIM, I AM THE UNITED KING
They only fire if they can see you.
linsett: I AMMA GOING TO CALIFORNIA!
meh too lazy i'll just take a nether fortress when i found one
Which interestingly enough, they cannot do through glass.
AJIsAwesome Exaclibur, from the united king, I'm looking for her, I'm going to California~
so what's everyone up to? :P
not much Allegr0
oh lookie people :)
Sleep.
Maybe they see with sound?
I'm watching "Whose Line"
Allegr0: Not much.
Allegr0: stream issues happened throughout the movie
I had a rather exhausting week
I'm watching Music Movies

Sound would bounce right off of glass, I think.
I'll make a deal that if I break over 100 followers on Twitter, I'll place one of every MLP tattoo I have on my body :) (Only the tattoos I have at least two of >>)
@otakon be sure to watch the Hunchback review of music movies
Yay for weird ass Japanese ads: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwp&NR=1&v=Oq8xuVnB-Pk
chat derp?
Squallken: that's what I'm doing
Interesting idea, but I'm more inclined to chalk it up to the programming team not changing the general block detection.
you will love it
Squallken: I'm enjoying it atm
so many youtube vids
I like Hunchback quite a LOT
That works too.
No, I was with a group of friends and we did volunteer work throughout the past week :P

I do not think it is possible to
oohshiny Wtf Rainbow Dash sounds wrong...like unholy wrong.
Yes. I ought to find another Extreme Hills biome and create one.
linsett IKR

oohshiny At least Flutters sounds decent.
That ought to stave off the urge to bury myself inside the nearest hole.
Anything streaming currently?

I just don't know what went wrong
Bronyhawk: odd
Again, apologies for the wait. While the steam is fine, the site is having external issues, so we're waiting till the site is up for everyone before we begin :)
>_>
CloudFlare? :P
Thanks Allegr0 :D

MY PRECOUS
Ohai VenHur :3
13Our webhost just had a small outage, it appears to be resolving itself.
13If you see Cloudflare errors, just click the "retry for a live version" button.
13Cloudflare may take some time to synchronize after this problem is resolved.
13Thank you for not complaining.
:D
tahnks fore the heads up Shamroc
goddammit
Oh, Shizu. That last line, ha.
Dat tabfail
"Thank you for not complaining"
thanks for the heads up Shizuka, how was your nappage?
Shizuka: Your welcome :P
Thanks for the advice Shizuka.
hi SuperBrony64
fire dem missiles
You can tell Shizu wasn't paying attention to chat.
13i was
okay brb refreshing the page!
13it's preemptive
Wait. Is the stream on or not? I'm so confused 6_9
13nittany relayed in tf2, i looked into it
Aha
13it's fixing itself, my site was down and up too
Shizuka good thing I was gone. Canadians, y'know?
me too!
13vortal cord is almost identical to bronystate's setup... cloudflare dns, heavily cached, hosted on NFS
:'( im canadian
Well it's good to now everything's working itself out.
13only difference is mine is more complex, which makes it even easier to see if it's a bronystate problem or an NFS problem
*know
Simples.
okay back
/me is Equestrian
my stream is STILL dead
goddammit
/me is a boss
fluttershyFTW a favourite Canadian pass-time is complaining.
otakon: nelson muntz
I'm getting mips, but nothing on it.
/me smacks mips.tv with a brick.
Allegr0: I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!
Bronysith: Who's Nelson Muntz?
Whos from canada?
So while the Cloudflare thing is still going on, who here plays the Mann vs Machine co-op? I haven't yet unfortunately.

OohShiny haven't heard of that.

I'm not Canadian, not at all. But it occured to me that I should've complained about this, but the thought crossed my mind AFTER it was resolved.
fluttershyFTW I want cake
Oh, I haven't readed it, but it is any good?
fluttershyFTW: No! I'll get fat! D:
Ah, I'm seeing LimeV too.

VenHur
VenHur well, it's a pretty good story, but the end is just... I don't know
Sillies, we Canadians don't complain. We're too busy apologizing.
VenHur: I played it. It's hard and frustrating for a new player
Who's ready for this stream to get ready? :)

Want some cheese with that wine?

Runescape time?
1,11It's funny, I was actually considering trying to play this...

It was made for me to play when I get super HIGH
that is horrib;e
flutter_spin:i tried running it with a old computer didnt work
LoGaN I say!
I was considering playing this game when I was a kid
*horrible
1,11lawl
GigabitHarmonie Allegr0, you guys should play a League of Legends match...
They probably play LoL for fun
My brother loved this game when he was younger, so I considered playing it....
not should, I mean, you guys could
Until I realized it makes no sense.
And Jim left?
That's what she said
brb, need more food
I'm coming back in
WTF IS THIS ABOUT?
GigabitHarmonie, Allegr0: Which game are you going to play next? LoL or TF2?
canadian_brony I already had some pizza
I don't suppose anyone else is up for some MvM?
Pizza
MALK: weird stuff. Killing stuff. Leveling up.
Woo
pong
You're gonna throw toms?
1,11What's the backup game?
i had pizza for my birth day today XD its from pizza hut too
that was my question
flutter_spin still doesnt make sense
Happy cupcake day
MALK: its ok. I remember watching a 30min video of them shooting at a boss. Didn't look like fun.
1,11Pizza hut is good pizza, though I personally prefer Papa Johns.
DashWithRainbows, you alive?
^
Silverscreen: Monday Mania?
aye
sonicandmario85 Today's your birthday? Well happy birthday. Have a brohoof. /)
We Canadians have Panago :3
I work at Sbarros.
playing some MvM mann up
The hell is wrong with this stream?
insett:thanks :3
Silverscreen: Godfather's is king though
Silverscreen: Agreed. I was so thrilled to find out Papa John's delivers here. :D
Ah
linsett: /)
flutter_spin: nice I love the strombollies there
You won't want to play with us just yet then. Have fun.
Silverscreen: You are the first person I ever met who prefers Papa Johns over Pizza Hut.
I suppose we could always bug otakon or something.
a's
silverscreen Agreed. Domino's is just chemicals and crap.
otakon: It's Maple Story, which seems to stink
I think this site is blocking my IP...
I AM COMMING
bad site
otakon: Up for some MvM?
Could do.
mitamaking: it doens't
mmm. Free pizza from Sbarros. The one perk of working there.
Silverscreen: Personally, I like ALL kinds, even Domino's.
1,11Ninja Barrels?
ajisawesome Really?
Reikim: maybe have to see if my connection is derping
I haven't played it, I won't judge
BARRELS!
He complains about his connection, again
Ghost BARRELS
YOU FUCKING BARREL CAN WALK NOW!
flutter_spin you work there I like that place
blow them away Allegr0
barrels*
Bronysith: Up for MvM?
1,11VenHur: Dominos and Little Ceasers used to be my favorite. Then the companies kinda went downhill on quality.
His connection sucks all the time.
The sounds I'm making are less than appropriate, lol
Reikim: nah man, playing letgend of dragoon
1,11Ninja Barrels!
this is a training stage?
Applejack, We've got a problem! You're Cider is walking away
silverscreen There's no Little Caesars where I live
Every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, every hour of every day, every day of every week, every week of every month, every month of every year, every year of every decade, every decade of every century.
silverscreen So yeah
My favorite pizza place is Blue Baker I dont think anyone knows what that is
Ghost Barrels? More like Ghostler Barrels! Huh? Am I right?
this is a boss style moveset
GigabitHarmonie: Use the boost to get through the barrels!
malk Could you explain?
That's Great :)
Forget the chain pizza joints, I've so many good local places near me
i like carusos
MALK:my fav is pizza place is pizz ahut
i feel so special:3
Slurpy Derpy?
SLURPY DERPEH
D:
I ate dinner at a local pizza joint so yeah
sonicanmario85 I like thin pizza as oposed to manufactued pizza
And lolwut SLurpy Derpy
18 barrels to go
1,11JESmith71: Agreed. Local pizza places tend to be the best.
THANK YOU
I'm having... two glasses of chocolate milk for dinner
look at derpy go!
My Butt hurts now
otakon: Verdict?
Yay we're leaving this crappy game
In Canada, we have a pizza chain called Panago; they serve dips with their pizza :3
Reikim: I think I can do it, but I'll have to close the stream
15 to go, you can do it
linsett I know a family-run pizza place wun by bronies.
NullMaidix: Don't you mean two chocolate milk of glasses?
otakon: Do as you will.
*run
GigabitHarmonie:you should play spore and stream it XD
AJIsAwesome: could be, I'm not sure really
1,11http://us6.memecdn.com/12-inches_o_631003.jpg
I had a pet whiskey bottle once...named Jack....had him with a side of BBQ >_>
Slurpy Derpy NOOOOOOO

NullMaidix: I was refrencing Discord.:)
lol
The only good big pizza chain is Mellow Mushroom
Canadian_Brony, Cool, you must go there a lot...
Cypresswolf Me Too his name was Jack Daniels
JESmith71: my original boss moved there
GigabitHarmonie: Which game you're going for now?
1,11I have Spore, but honestly, I don't like it. I like customization, but that game is nothing BUT customization, and it gets old after a while.
AJIsAwesome: and I was playing off the part where I just ran some indeterminate amount of miles, assumed to be in the 4 range
Silverscreen: You are awesome.
Logic logic logic logic
Easy. Just pretend the game doesn't exist.
i failed my will save against game
After 5 years of WoW, I now hate it
NullMaidix: Ok.
Wow, not every game is WoW
pong pong pong!!
linsett whenever I can, usually just to hang out. It's on the other side of town, though, and takes a long time just to bike there
World of Warcraft? Is that a fishing game? :P
things get a bit woozy
:3
Don't you guys have a Steam?

GigabitHarmonie: PLAY TF2 WITH US!
Silverscreen:you cant customize your creature in space stage and you can destroy planets too XD
/me chuckles
Silverscreen: You know, we has A LOT in common, I has the same reaction too, but for me, the space travelling section is kinda fun, and hell, you can even find EARTH!
what the h is a World of warcraft?
GigabitHarmonie: TF2 MVM!
canadian_brony You lucky dog.
aw
i like how i can see what bots are on
uggg
drumroll
GigabitHarmonie: you, me, Reikim, Allegr0 and someone else

GRAB THE TORCHES
LEFT 4 DEAD 2!

Here's some pitchforks
Thanks for the advance warning.

GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0: Play TF2's Mann Vs Machine Co-Op Mode!
Reikim: meet you in Phase's server?
sigh, so boring
50 DOLLARS A MONTH
OH GOD
make room, hah
YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT
TO TF2!
so, anyone up to a League of Legends match?
otakon: Sure. The one that isn't full.
MVM
Silverscreen: And now there's another argument against WoW. It's called GW2.
My stream is not working
otakon: You know the pass.
I can't play MvM . . .
THATS THE POINT GUYS
1,11gw2?
my stream is blank.
Guild Wars 2.
OohShiny: if you'll take someone who hasn't played in... 2-3? years? I could roll a match
otakon can I join you?

NullMaidix I think 2 and a half years
Never played GW1 you mean?
Reikim can I join you guys?
2 years sounds about right then
Allegr0 can I join you?
Yeah, forget about it. GW2 is a very different game.
>_>
MALK: I odn't see why not, though with otakon we'll be full.
Oh, LFD2?
BRAINS
1,11I personally think MvM is overrated. It's just a 6-team vs. the computer.
Lt. Derpy Hooves?
NullMaidix you're up to a treat, you need to update it
BRONY BRAINS
Lt. Derpy Hooves?
GigabitHarmonie can I play?
I never played Guild Wars 2, but Silverscreen does has a point on Warcraft, why is it you has to pays for the best contents of the game for an overpriced item?! It's like DLC, but worse!
Lieutnant Derpy Hooves
OohShiny: hrmph... apparently i do need to update, even though I re-downloaded it like last week
1,11I'd join, but I don't have L4D2.
sonicandmario85 Nah, nah, nah, gonna eat your braaaiinnsss

No L4D2 for me
I wanna play!!!
Urzu Seven, nice name

1,11I haven't gone to any cons whatsoever. I wanted to go to Techocon, but I didn't have the money.
comic con is pretty alright~
I would try to go to the NY comic con, but I might be busy in the fall.
GigabitHarmonie: Allegr0 come to dragoncon next week in atlanta please. i would love to meet you guys

TheKoreanBrony1354 TF2

GigabitHarmonie: Allegr0 thats okay, ill take pics for you guys
Desucon is a tiny convetion in Oslo, like 200 bucks admittance?

Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Are you guys going to Canterlot Gardens?
WTF is Anthrocon?
GigabitHarmonie what do you think about the Mann vs Machine Update? Not just about the Gamemode
I almost started reading it in costa rica
Oh god... 50 Shades of Grey?
forget i asked
Its not a bad read
canadian_brony its a furry con
/me sticks his toungue in GigabitHarmonie s ear
1,11Anthrocon is a convention for Furries to meet artists, writers and other furries.
Bronysith: O_O

Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
What do you think of Slender Mane?
4
*
sonicandmario85: No, they were mostly DVD's and stuff
sonicandmario85: No. VHS only.
1,11Unfortunately, the majority of furries that go to Furrycon are the ones that give the fandom a bad name. -_-
Is the question "which company is the biggest bunch of dicks"?
Feeling better, Allegr0 ?
Because yeah sorry folks, but EA wins that hands fucking down
What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it
I'd wipe out MTV.
Okay. Guys. You two wish to go to a pony con that's on the weekend of your birthday, but you're really young, and your parents aren't willing to pay for the ticket costs. What do?
WOULD KILL SOUTH KORE (NOT) OR NORTH KOREA (YES BIG YES)

Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie of course you guys dont have the same bottom... you aint siamese twins.

1,11DeadpoolDash: Is there a problem?
Never met a furry >.>
Guys. The huntsman is the greatest weapon ever in the worlds to use in MvM.
GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0: if you could have any gun, which gun would you choose?
If you had played minecraft so did you played Tekkit before?
1,11Panda: well you have now.
TheKoreanBrony1354: Wait, where in SK are you in?
PLANTS VS ZOMBIES OR PLANTS VS ZOMBIES
Furries are dangerous people Panda.
its just an interesting topic on the interwebs
Silverscreen no no no i mean Irl
YES IAM SOUTH KOREAN
They're not even from Siam :P
Silverscreen I think he means IRL
This guy talks too much.
1,11Ah.
EA has lost the very last of my faith when they vowed to destroy C&C forever. Now I want Ricotello drawn and quartered. :|
brbz
TheKoreanBrony1354: You lvie near the border?
And his voice is grating my ears.

Reikim, T, Phase4, tell me it's not just me.

What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it...
oh new comics
YES

XylemTube: I was going to make that joke............:'(
AHAHHAHHH
My question: PSY breaks into your house and calls you "sessy lady" what do?
NO
Any fanfics you guys recommend?
i'm fine with it
Dayum, campfire song is stuck in my head :P
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Are you guys going to Canterlot Gardens?
You're no help at all.
Buytoast erm... you dont have to be a furry to have those kinks >.>
hai everypony :3
not ideal but i'm fine with it
Spell-of-Gaming: Hi!
reikim seems to have internet problems
Allegr0: What is the address for your wedding? We will watch through the windows >_>
I didn't say you have to be.
Monster. How should I feel.
Allegr0: ...i can haz hugs?
1,11Just like bronies, the furry fandom has those people that make them appear to be the spawn of satan. There's a lot of awesome and safe furry artwork out there, and people fail to acknowledge how furries have been in society for the longest time without any of the negative.
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
You have a good Fluttershy impression. Y u no use it for comic relief.
WHAT WOULD NAME YOUR KID
Well yeah, that's a given Silverscreen.
IF IT WAS A PONY
Silverscreen: That's actually correct. Saberspark says that we actually get insulted in soem of the same ways as them.
Just the bad furries are the kind of people who are truly horrific.
Silverscreen ^^ Thank you. I dont know much about the furry community outside someones brief explaination.
Monster or rockstar?
Even I fear them.
If MLP did not exist, what would you guys do?
Buytoast whats there to fear?
Just so you know, Slender has an updated version called Sanatorium.
Buytoast: Explain.
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: i have two questions i would like answered, "Have you seen whare the hell is matt 2012"? and "What would you do if you played minecraft with Gavinfrom roosterteeth"?
I am neutral on this furry conversation.
I never knew what furries were.
The bad furries will actually try to firce you into an orgy and shit.
ROOSTER TEETH
I like furry art, don't really care otherwise
force*
Oh geeze, Korean Brony, a pony can't bear a kid; ponies are not goats :|
I LIKE MICHAEL
I don't care about furries, honestly.
Buytoast heh, I dont see the problem in that XD but thats personal preference
You have a good Fluttershy impression. Y u no use it for comic relief.
I'm neutral for furries. Love and tolerate.
Polydunami: you made me laugh!
It's just like that secret club on the internet thing again.
Mmmph mmmph mmmmmm!
I mean they rape you Panda.
1,11Exactly. Which is why I find it hypocritical as hell for bronies to hate on furries and vice-versa. They have similar fandoms and at the very least should respect each other for holding their heads high against all the bullshit that they take.
ALEGR0 WOULD YOU WANNA BE FAT OR DUMB
UMLIMITED POWAAAAAAAH
Like that creepy dude I saw at bronyxon?
Buytoast not rape if you want it ;)
Sexual harrassment panda~
linsett XD
T rex vs Giant Python
But the people don't want that sonny boy.
FICK!
GigabitHarmonie is best pyro.
FICK IT TO HELL
As long as they respect, I'm cool with it. It's when they start looking for trouble that makes it ridiculous :S
One guy was practically enslaved via shock collar by two insane furry chicks.
11,01Silverscreen: Agreed.
pyro disproves
AJIsAwesome TAKE IT BACK! Shizuka is best pyro!
WHAT SFAVORITE SPORT
hi Nittany_Discord
Could you try bronycon next year?
I will say this again. What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it
Nittany_Discord!!!!! how are you :D
Nittany_Discord: oh hi there
11,01Hi.
Hi Nitty
Allegr0: THANK YOU

hi Shizuka
Shizuka:HELLO
Allegr0 How did you decide that it was time for marriage for you?
Nope
Spell-of-Gaming No! That's my shtick!
I'd be on LoL a lot lol
Shizuka: your ping is no match for my pong :I
Shizuka I didnt mean to ping you if you were busy >.<
For me it doesnt
Derpy_Hooves No! That's my shtick!
Allegr0: How did you decide that it was time for marriage for you?
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Have you played Super Smash Bros.? If yes, which one do you prefer?
1,11What negatives have you encountered since you joined the fandom?
THAT VID IS AMAZING
alegr0 do you love this all
I haven't seen it!!!! 2012 is out?
gavin
Pingas :I
Gavin
Which fandom?
how do you NOT know who Gaben is?
Kawaii_icybeauti: where is matt 2012
Well if My Little Pony never existed, little girls would still have Barbie... actually, that's kind of a bleak future :(
anybody getting lag?
the ponyfags or the furfags?
1,11I, personally, have gotten into numerous arguments on what the fandom is, why the fandom is so large and how our content is NOT the spawn of satan. -_-
RTX 2012
This website would have never exsisted...
aw
and yes AJIsAwesome, they have played.
its a meme
Allegr0:gaben is the creator of steam
Silverscreen: When the heck they mention that? o.o
Silverscreen: I've actually never gotten flak for it, have met outsiders who don't like the show, but- nothing more than that
ALEGR0 TWIX SWIRL OR LAYERD
Allegr0 anf GigabitHarmonie: gav ing is the roosterteeth troll, and where the hall is matt, i will link that to you two in a bit
NOT TODAY ZERG ....toy story much?
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
Personal? Tube socks or Tube tops? o.O
Gigabitharmonie Who do you like more: Vinyl or Octavia?
Some bronies are bronies just because the show is good. If I hadn't encountered My Little Pony, I would've been even more depressed than I am now.
Would you try gourmet insects?
How did you guys meet?
AJIsAwesome: true
Melee has a harder learning curve
You have a good Fluttershy impression. Y u no use it for comic relief.
what is ur favourite shipping?
1,11I prefer Brawl because of the extentions and has the most options. In terms of gameplay, Brawl is more fun, but Melee is better for competitive play.
AJIsAwesome: Same. I would have never become close friends with my brony friend.
00,10How much wood could a wood chuck, chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
Silverscreen ^^
hi Sumica
Silverscreen: couldnt agree more
Sumica ALL THE WOOD!
Sumica: ... BOOT TO THE HEAD
Sumica alot
IF HAD TO KILL KIRBY OR PIKACHU ( 1ST EVOULTION)
/me throws a boot at Sumica
I like playing Brawl a lot. My main is Jigglypuff :)
A woodchuck would chuck as much wood as it could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
I've been through a lot stuff in life, and this show proved to me that there IS faith in humanity.
Have you guys ever thought about what MLP would be like if MLP didn't exist?
:D
linsett well... it wouldnt exist XD
wha . . .
Nope. that would be Olimar
linsett: I'm sorry, I really can't think about that....
/me throws a boot shaped brick at Bronysith
WHATS YOUR PET PEEVE
GigabitHarmonie: Allegr0 got a favourite video game?
Wait, I meant if the fanbase didn't exist.
Seriously, the smash sound in 64 is the most wonderful sound in the world :D
ALEGR0 WHATS YOUR PET PEVVE
I actualy like long throws. More invicibility frames.
/me eats Sumica s brick
Sorry guys, that was a typo......
linsett: I personally would still watch it, I came across the show without the fandom
OMG YES
linsett well... we wouldnt know each other here >.> thats for sure.

11,01That creates haters.

How much would Pinkie Pie pink pinkies pink Pinkie's pink pinkies.
GigabitHarmonie Favorite Shipping?
1,11Yes. I don't like people that do that. It's annoying, and all it does and spawns more haters.
I hate it when people shove to other people's throats :S
11,01That makes it harder on the rest of the fandom.
Spectrum_Rush: That would be the end of all the walls.

Those are the worst kind of people.
00,10so spitfire and dash then Silverscreen?
GigabitHarmonie: pot/kettle

That's not being hypocritical
11,01But people that show their views in other's faces is a problem with all groups.
ALEGR0 MASTERCARD OR DISCOVERY
I'm a FF and MM whore, so all my OTP's are gay
Well yeah.
1,11Sumica: I said MALE wonderbolt, so more likely Soarin' or Firestreak.
Silverscreen: how about soarin and spitfire? or spitfire and rainbow dash
You're doing it as entertainment and gather the fandom under one roof
Silverscreen: or how about braeburn and soarin?
Gay ben?
I don't think you're doing it because you want to be "famous"
who is firestreak? O_o
I never read shipping.

My internet bugged and I was disconnected :[ :[ :[ :[ :[ :[
What do you hope for in season 3?
I should really use my nickname lol
Silverscreen: I don't agree
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: what is the most retarded idea that a brony has tried making a reality? Sumica, Shizuka, AND SlurryMoon kn ow what kickstarter im talking about
But I don't want to go on that path either lol
my damn stream isn't working
Is that actually happening, Silverscreen?
What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it
gooooo
Allegr0: how did you decide it was time for you to get married?
Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie got a favourite video game?
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
Alegr0 febrezze or axe
11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: You AFK?
Gigabitharmonie Favorite Shipping?
the thing is, I dont thing RD represents any sexuality
Silverscreen: They did? I don't like it considering the fact that Rainbow Dash's sexuality has not been confirmed.
00,10LGBT?
Wait, can someone link that to me?
1,11They're not doing it officially, but the bronies of the LGBT do it.
Wait what?
My damn steam is not working
/me tactically deployed Pony Gangnam Style into a chat room, just to see the reactions. :3
11,01Also, yikes.
what is ur favourite shipping?
You have a good Fluttershy impression. Y u no use it for more comedy relief.
There's a thing?
Sumica Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transexual alliance.
They're trying to co-opt her?
The problem is that Rainbow Dash has no confirmed sexuality.
ALEGR0 MITT ROMENY OR OBAMA
lemme go check that out.
simply because ANYTHING with a rainbow = LGBT is.... dunb?
Would you cry over spilt milk?
00,10try sexual?
*dumb
00,10try any thing once
Dashie is still best pony <3
Well, every canon romance is heterosexual.
seriously?
Huh, ain't that weird
So they're basically forcing anythign rainbow to be their symbol.
my damn stream isn't working
1,11Lauren Faust officially stated that, aside from pre-set characters, they don't have a set sexuality. So it's entirely fanon.
ALEGR0 MITT ROMENY OR OBAMA
^^
and a great decision that was
11,01I like to think RD is straight.
1,11aside from pre-set couples*
Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie got a favourite video game?
ALEGR0 DO YOU LIKE PS3 OR XBOX
RD is straight
can you imagine how much worse all this fighting would be if they explicitly made it canon?
11,01Hello.
HAI!!
1,11...
alone you are
Same here Nittany, but meh
What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it

HEEYY

rd is not bi, idk why ppl think that
Nittany_Discord eh ?
Even if she were bi or gay she would still be cool
Any fanfics you guys would recommend?
We have communication error!
Ohai
They would never consider making a gay pony.
Oh, never mind :P
Allegr0 ang GigabitHarmonie: let me rephrase my question, "What do you think of this http://www.indiegogo.com/Equestria "?!
I like Straight RD because she's so often gay, but fanon is different for each fic
11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Going to try and fix those sprays.
ALEGR0 AND GIGABOT 4 EVER
Unleash the S_M!!!!
Buytoast: I don't know about that
You saw the shitstorm when retard Mc Cross-Eyed accidently had a weird voice?
lol the quitness
11,01It's funny that there is a ton of lesbian shipping in the MLP fandom.
1,11Personally, I see Twilight as becoming a Lesbian more than Rainbow Dash.
She's gay or bi in the fanverse
superretroworld it's all fanon, so it's all up to what we think
ALEGR0 MITT ROMENY OR OBAMA
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT

AJTheMightyGamer: Night!
my stream isn't working
00,10I pleeed the second and the fith
11,01I once saw art of a kid produced out of Twixie.
the lack of males was disputed in s2
SONGS
00,10I got a gun and i dont want to talk about it
Sorry I was gone. Internet connection.
WHATS FAVORITE BAND
APPLEPIE!!
The Equestrian Island project did not take into account how much it would take to ship the supplies needed to built it in the first place, then there's upkeep, rent or property taxes....doomed to failure from the start
ALEGR0 DO U LIKE K POP
1,11lawl
so Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie did you get my message about me giving up a SMITE beta key?
a claranet?..
Cypresswolf: the equestria project was retarded
TheKoreanBrony1354: KISS, AC/DC, Backstreet Boys, etc.
I can just imagine Allegr0 holding a clarinet at the bow of the titanic
is anyone's stream working?
11,01Using genderswap magic, same-sex couples can have children (in MLP RP).
ALEGR0 TF2 OR COUNTER STRIKE
that being said, my favorite shipping atm, is either Twilight x human (Hands, Shackles and Friendship) or Twixie (Of Maids and Mistresses is good)
Cypresswolf: Is that that whole lets buy an island and make a giant ass statue on it thing?
Nittany_Discord just a sec i'm in a match of MvM
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Have you guys heard of the Brony island?
Vinyl x Octavia?
11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: K.
By what means could anyone get there to begin with - youre right Derpy_Hooves it was a foolish idea
1,11My two favorites would be Fluttershy x Big Mac and Twilight x Trixie.
Spike x Rarity
Pinkie Sparrow
ew ew ew. Make the shipping stop.
do it u wimp
o_O
1,11oh god.
You have a good Fluttershy impression. Why don't you use it for more comedy relief during your show?
flutter_spin: To each his own.
my OTP would be Luna and Celestia-
LOL
/me leaves this conversation
1,11The mental images...
TheKoreanBrony1354: yes, genesis, the stone roses, u2, the beatles
Do you think spike and rarity are ment to be?
Eugh ships
Ew ew. You're a hipster for not shipping. -said by no one.
Allegr0 x GigabitHarmonie
otaship is only OTP
Silverscreen: Sorry if I made shocks you, but I really hates shipping.
You guys like ELO?
Spike and Rarity seems really creepy to me :S
1,11I've seen enough furry porn to know that Spike x Rarity could work.
Buytoast: yes
Only DJ Fedex can ship
CiderIsForDrinking: this
00,10DarixDoctor
Well, the Spike x Rarity is onesided, though.
Ahahaha
but i think Bronystates favorite ship is otakon x anything :)
Dari x Tennant
They actually thought it would work out?
Holy shit those people were dense.
00,10there is artwork too Silverscreen, of the ofspring that is.
I can hear the ping from here.
11,01A strange one was r63 Fluttershy (Butterscotch) x OC coupling where Butterscotch changed his gender and beared the child, but he wasn't Fluttershy as a girl.
Ryunosuke, that's off limits, though
nono. That kind of ship isn't allowed here
Oh no....I'm not too good at this...
The Spike x Rarity fanbase makes me cringe.
Was that a bane voice?
Through the Eyes of Another Pony. My most favoritests fic
0_o
Niether because I'm pissed at either one of them.
(goes all fluttershy)
IF YOU HAD TO PICK A NEW LAYS POTATO CHIP FLAVOR WHAT WOULD IT BE
lawl
through the eyes is good too
Oh god
My fave was My little avengers
>Lays potato chip
Spell-of-Gaming: How?
Allegr0: *Slow clap*
Silly boy, they're called Walkers.
oooook....
aginst the roolz
Sleepwaklers
It's called the royal canterlot voice.
1,11I apologize to those of you that don't like Shipping, but it is an inevitable part of this fandom. Best you can do is just ignore the conversation.
SPIDERMAN.MP$
You broke the ROOLZ!!
11,01Allcaps spam is forbidden.
Just got kicked out of the everfree radio chat
inb4 Wrek
BUT IT'S CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
What the fuck is shipping?
GigabitHarmonie: Do you know Allegr0's fiancé?
I am keeping my opinions on shipping neutral. I am fine if you discuss it around me, but I will not engage in a shipping conversation.
1,11...
ban his hammer
1,11Banning the banhammer
lol. I want email!
Gigabitharmonie Who would you rather have as a mother Molestia or Trollestia?
...Banception...?
Silverscreen: I agree. I'm not one to ship, but if you want to you can. LOve and tolerate.
/me sets mode +b *!*@banhammer?
XylemTube no, it's a one-way-ticket to a kick
alegr0 what flavor would you choose for a new lays chip
MASF123: It's couples.
ouch
/me channels his inner wrek "no allcaps"
What is shipping?
oh ok
MASF123: Imagine all the ponies fucking.
That's shipping.
11,01What is your favorite math equation?
11,01:p
no ty
Those people over at teh everfree radio are such prudes can't take a joke or someone saying penis over and over again
What kind of music you guys like?
Nittany_Discord: i have a question for you
Best way to do Bane voice: Sosphisticated voice talking into a glass cup
Canadian_Brony: i've used all caps before, never was a big deal before
try it
You have a good Fluttershy impression. Why don't you use it more often during your Steam playthrough?
Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie hoe did you feel when you first became a brony?
11,01Derpy_Hooves: Yes?
Huh?
Like for comic relief?
XylemTube I know, but spamming it is agianst the rules
:D
Wut
alegr0 did you get good grades when you were little
Shipping is an inevitable part of any fandom. I generally dislike the slash shipping. But any major fandom of a work with a high gender disparity is bound to have a lot of it.
Buytoast: Stop. That's NOT the definition of shipping. Shipping can be only romantic, too. Not just sexual.
suddenly Sean Connery?
:D
dat Big Macintosh
too bad, once the ship has been made, you can't deny it
It's naturally worse with Touhou.
alegr0 low 5 or hi 5
Garrus_Vakarian: Suuuuuure, because that won't ruin their reputation.
$2000
On a pony painting
No
My God
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
...for charity
How lonely must you be?
Kandarihu: I'm the opposite- I usually can't enjoy straight shipping, though I definitely will enjoy it at times if it is really well written
Gensokyo - Where everyone is gay.
Kandarihu: Avatar the Last Airbender is worst shipping, because it is all possible
That... is ... BEAUTIFAL
To spend 2k on a pony picture.
Nittany_Discord: why are you Nittany and why are you Discord? :I
Neither:(
I'd take Trollestia any day.
:D
lulz
lol
I honestly think that people are forgetting that Kirisame Marisa is a girl, just to ship her with Alice Margatroid.
dat defenition
Shipping and Handling beeeeeeyeetch
my stream is not working.
MATH YO
DAT DEFINITION:D
lol
dat math
Allegr0 that shipping talk is too hot for bronystate o///o
MATH UP IN THIS BIIIYAAAATTCCHH!
Kandarihu but aren't all touhou characters girls?
Math mothafuckas
Pythagrian Theorem: New single by Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie
$8000 for a fury costume wth
Allegr0 & GigabitHarmonie: my second to last question for you "Have you heard of dash drives"?
alegr0 do you have any mlp toys
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Have you guys heard of the Brony island?
furry
umm
How many asses do you get on a daily basis?
lol
00,10robot chicken did it already
1,11Buytoast: Okay, shipping is a lot, LOT more than just the fucking. There are tons of Shipping fanfics out there that only show the relationship and the love that's being put between the two characters. Your generalization is a bullshit description that's no better than how haters of the fandom call us Pedophile Manchildren.
Dken2021, except for three, yes.
that... is not... pythagorum theorm
I like this one: x equals -b + or - the square root of b square minus 4ac, all over 2a :P
Silverscreen: But those are not that popular
:p
Silverscreen: I'm sorry, I started laughing at the pedophile manchildren :D
the nonfucking ones are sickly popular
SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK FTW
All that while in rhythm of "Pop Goes the Weasel" :D
Kandarihu three? I never heard of these non-female characters
11,01Derpy_Hooves: Nittany comes from the mascot of my grad school Penn State (Nittany Lions). Discord comes from the MLP villain. My non-brony nick is Nittany_Tiger, a portmanteau of Nittany Lion and Tiger (of Clemson University where I got my undergraduate).
I know Silverscreen. Doesn't mean people don't make them fuck in alot of it.
inb4 PedoPony
School House Rocks, heck yeah
One guy only exists prior to a reboot, the second guy only exists in expanded universe, and the third is a cloud.
...so shipping is clopfics? I'm confused. :/
good times. good times.
1,11Nittany: Ironic, I"m thinking of going into Penn State.
Explosions ors Implosions?
alegr0 whats heavier the total amount of fanfics or 900 asian elephants
Nittany_Discord: i was just dicking with you :P, i wasn't expecting an answer like that :3
Conjunction Junction, whats your functionnn~
MASF123: no shipping is romance, clop is porn
1,11I LOVE SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK!
I only saw one...The bill one..:(
mitamaking ever heard of "Twilight's List"? IIRC, it is the most popular shipping story on FimFiction.net
i do
MASF123: It's pretty much just relationships.
Allegr0: and company, would do you guys do for work outside of bronystate?
romance? ok
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
TL;DR: Shipping isn't all sexual intercourse, if it is, it makes us all pedophiles.
I saw that and conjunction. Ugh... lol
School House Rock <3
Hookin up Words and Phrases and Clauses
MASF123 that is shipping
:O No School House Rock? Blastphemy!
Not heard of Dash drives
11,01It's a good school. We all hate that paedophile coach as well.
Lel
all of the mane 6 are over 21,
my high school teachers had tapes of school house rock
I did get to see bill nye and magic school bus in skool
Alegro do you know whats superponybeat os
Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie what r ur jjeerrrbbs?
Spell-of-Gaming, there is a difference between Shipfics and Clopfics
uggh
that thing has WAAAAY to much support
Can someone clarify what Friendshipping is? I haven't heard of it before. I know of shipping, but I've never heard of Friendshipping.
6 million?
My highschool sceince teacher still shows bill nye
BronyState pirate boat is much better idea
Vivix, Lauren said they are under 4 years of age how the fuck are they 21?
AJIsAwesome: friendshipping is just someone becoming friends
WHERE IS THIS KICKSTARTER!
Friendshipping is a prmance
I remember when those shows were actually on, Kawaii_icybeauti xD
Vivix: Thanks.
That's where all the BronyState gold proceeds are going
Ryunosuke: Yup. Shipfics usually just show the relationship of the indicated couple while clopfics are mostly sexual crap.
MASF123: all the mane six are independent adults
Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie how did you feel when you first became a brony?
Kawaii_icybeauti I saw Bill Nye in school and Magic School Bus on TV. I also got to borrow VHS tapes from the library, most of them were Bill Nye and Magic School Bus.
What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it
Vivix, I'm not sure if they're over 21. They're physically adults. But I'm thinking they might be like real ponies and have shorter lifespans than humans. That means they mature sooner.
1,11SILVERSCREEN QUESTION: What do you think of the Love and Tolerate mantra?
<_<
4 packs is enough.
Kandarihu: THAT mgiht be true, but yes they are all adults
I HAVE FLUTTERSHY TO
/me has no merch :'(
Perhaps the only pony who's 21 is Granny Smith.
1,11I has a Twilight and Pinkie Pie toy. That's about it.
Silverscreen, oh dear, here we go
After translating some 2ch threads about MLP, ive come to the conclusion that applejack is the most popular pony in Japan. I guess she has to be the most popular somewhere...
Polydunami: God, I feel young :'(
Nittany_Discord: permission to drop the dash drives link? :3
11,01Silverscreen: There's also a brony group at Penn State I was a part of. They're trying to become an official group.
MAKE ME SANDWHICH
I can't find any local Pony merch.
Kandarihu: but that would make the CMC age super fast, a horse matures in 2 years
http://www.indiegogo.com/Equestria Equestria Island is not having
*happening
I'm only 22 and I feel old :S
I have a Twilight blindbag, and that's it.

TheKoreanBrony1354: *sandvich

Polydunami: im 16 and i feel old, idk why
DEY TERK ERRR JERRBS
Allegr0, GigabitHarmonie, and EVERYONE ELSE: http://www.dashdrives.com/ check that out :3
11,01I can link you their facebook page.
I felt old when I was 17, now I'm 23 and I feel yougn again
Love and Tolerate was started as a joke, but now it's really a serious thing which it's kinda good for the fandom, probably...
alegr0 and gigabits talk in 3rd person
I'm 21 and I feel like a lonely depressed suicial old person.
dy tok aur jorbs
1,11Fallout Equestria and that Nix one. XD
Does anyone have that one obscene Lyra plushie?
oh ma gerd berks
my stream isn't working.
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: What is your opinion on other fanons? Like Sonic or Mario, for example?
berks er gruuut
Silverscreen Past sins?
alegr0 would you be fat or dumb
Mario
I am so waiting for second printing of FOE-
1,11I'm in college at the moment and i'm actually doing my internship for it. Sorta why I'm usually not here sans BMN's and special streams.
/me 11,01drives Derpy_Hooves
it's gonna be around 150 dollars to get it to Norway
Nittany_Discord: D:
I'm entering high school this year xP
11,01Silverscreen: Past Sins.
1,11Yeah, Past Sins.
Entering college this year.
The End.
alegr0 do u have any shirts
I want to read Past Sins
Is it possible to sneeze while taking a piss?
11,01Past Sins is the longest MLP fanfic I finished.
I'm goign to start reading The Divine Comedy.
Past Sins is like, a requirement for fanfic readers...
My arms, typing fan fic
Go all Fluttershy on us!
1,11I see Love and Tolerate as a general guideline for a brony's morals. If it's something you enjoy, love it all the way. If it's something you don't like, just tolerate it rather than turning into an asshole. That said, you can't let yourself become a push over or a doormat. If you have to fight back, you f**king fight back.
LOVE AND PEACE!
My brother, unintentionally, got me to watch MLP lol
Love and tolerate should be an instaban
What is the tags on past sins? I never found it
:P
Love and Tolerate is just a punch line of the fandom. Don't put stock into it.
alegr0 forgive and forget
Yeah.... :S
Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie eeyup
Dang, I use LAT all the time
What does god need with a spaceship?
Love and Tolerate is a type of troll
Who is speakin? I just joined stream... XD
I use it too, but I used it before the show
Love and Tolerate USED to be a joke.
Love and Tolerate? Your kidding rite?
Jaketehsnake: GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0
It used to be a tactic to piss off trolls on /b/
It seems to me that Love and Tolerance is some sort of ego inflation to the fandom.
A jerkdick?
rofl, jerkdick
Or a dickjerk?
1,11shitty dicktits? What?
Dicktits, wooohoo
But it's being taken as a serious thing.
Jesus.
Love is to worship, Tolerance is to unleash your inner rage, at least that what I thinks of Love and Tolerance...
No one follows it anyway
Kandarihu: It is, for those who don't at least try to do it, you shouldn't try just because of the show though
:D
jerkdick! lol
hi
I no?
0,14'sup everyone?
alegr0 have you seen any sharks in your house
11,01"We" is plural first person.
SaxyPretender: Hi!
ohai SaxyPretender :3
11,01Hi SaxyPretender
what type of 3rd person starts with I?
he she me WUMBO
allo SaxyPretender
The oribinal /b/ronies used love and tolerate as a tool to piss off trolls, not as an actual behavioral change. It was the new bronies that took it and ran.
love and tolerate should be a real thing, at least to some degree. people who are too cool for it annoy me
1,11Silverscreen cannot speak in third person unless he is in the middle of an RP. Becuase it's f**king hard to do.
hi SaxyPretender. Welcome to random.
Only Haku can speak in third person on bronystate
twilight_sprinkle: yeah- agreed
alegr0 what new lays flavor would you choose
mitamaking can talk in 3rd person, yay tab buttong
1,11I prefer to be fat and intelligent rather than good-looking and f**king stupid.
Hi SaxyPretender, welcome to the Bat Credit Card madness.
Allegr0: and company, which pony would you rather ride into battle? Twilight Sparkle, Princess Luna, Princess Celestia, Despair or Ruin?
1,11You can still be good-looking while you're fat.
0,14O_O
Gigabot, If you were a cannibal, what side dish would be appropriate for your meal?
Screw Love and Tolerate I had bronies a plenty who were real dicks to me.
I'm super vain, I'd give up my intelligence for thin forever
Just kidding.
gigabot star wars or star trek
Silverscreen: You can fix ugly, you can't fix stupid.
Silverscreen: You can have a nice face
00,02otakon, still looking for a game?
But good looking?
Allegr0 a sneezing robot? Is that your protocol?
Hmmmm
1,11CriticKitten: *brohoof* that Tater Salad quote.
Meh
G'night Bronystate.
I don't like the bot talk :(
If 1 guy follows it, I demand we all should be forced to.
Nittany_Discord k i'm done
11,01GigabitHarmonie or Allegr0: I dare you to get up now and attempt a sonic rainboom.
Allegr0 bot eh? Crush, kill, destroy, clarinet?
11,01:p
Silverscreen: *brohoof*
alegrobot fan focs lol
11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: K. I might actually have sprays working.
Bye Earthworm Jim, I mean, Jim.
Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie what kind of shows do you like similar to mlp?
Randy is a three course meal, with dessert to seal the deal~
g'night Jim
Merciful mungbeans!!!!!!
What now?
1,11I've seen it. You don't want to. Trust me.
alegrobot what new lays flavor chip would you pick
Alegr0, how much have you been discriminated for being a brony?
we....dance party!
also swag
Voice cracking a bit?
And Swag.
Nittany_Discord so what's the deal, they don't appear in the selection or just can't spray them ?
Crush Kill Destroy... SWAG
alegrobot have you ever gambl
11,01Adding sprays doesn't even add the spray.
Your tempting me too
11,01But I just looked up the problem online.
Rather live in a friends' mansion for 10 Years and accomplish NOTHING in your life, or live in your car for 5 years, but get a carrer you would enjoy? Gigabit and Allegr0
LIES!
11,01I'm going to see if I just fixed it.
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Have you guys been to any Brony meetups besides convention?
MY EARS
Oy, Gigabit and Allegr0; which cast member of Friendship is Magic would you like to meet the most?
1,11SILVERSCREEN QUESTION: What's your favorite MLP Song? Mine is still Rarity's Art of the Dress.
have you met space core?
alegrobot heads or tails
"Silence" followed by laughter
I actually don't have a favorite song.
/me 11,01puts Silverscreen in a dress and runs
Mine's probably this day this aria
<nullpointerexception> (cannot find String "Clarinet"
kk Nittany_Discord tell me if it worked :3
unremixed
how can The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 not be your favorite?
Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie if you are robots, why can you laugh?
Silverscreen: At The FUCKING Gala!
Hrm.
That's ridiculous
damn, forgot to put 'like' in the last question
Smashing?
1,11*looks at dressed self in mirror*
Silverscreen Question: What is your least favorite mane 6 member
Oh Buytoast that is a good one
I think I'm gonna say Love Is In Bloom.
Fluttershy's on your podcast. Impersonate her. Go.
Silverscreen: Oh and This Day Aria...
who's the third person in the BG?
Ahhhhhh, its me, Bane!
alegrobot what is the stupidest movie you have evr seen
GigabitHarmonie Allegr0 Call of Duty or Battlefield?
Shit son that song gets me everytime wehn they start chanting cider
SEA PONIES!
I didn't mean the characters, I meant the actors :P
oh
I like Winter Wrap Up and Smile Smile Smile
MINE IS BEHIND YOU BY KYOGA :D
No Winter wrap up love!?
so many wonders
WUT!?
Smile smile smile! How could I forget!?
Art of the Dress
This Day Aria is solid, but the more I've heard it, the more it starts to bug me structurally. Love Is In Bloom is a song I can listen to continuously and never get tired of.
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: What are your opinions on the obscene Lyra plushie?
oh mai
smile song, duh
alegrobot tom hardy
0,14Question for the robros, most anticipated poni fan-game?
oh mai
meeehhhh . . .
Love is in bloom took me a while to like at all, but now I enjoy it
I want what she's having
:O
O_O
Which Lyra plushie?
OH, MY.
XD
uhhh
GigabitHarmonie how do you like Art of the Dress over Winter Wrapup?
Uh.....
O.o
You should listen to Kyoga-Behind you
I like At The Gala, This Day Aria, Winter Wrap Up, and my all time favorite, Sea Ponys!!
HOW!?
OOOHHH MYYYYY
is the stream working for anyone?
GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0 : best way to do a bane voice is Sean Connery impersonation into a glass cup
You scare me lol
11,01Sprays not working still :<
VenHur: LOL at the last one:D
OHHH MYYYYYYYY
1,11My least favorite Mane 6 member? That's a tough one. It's a toss up between Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Applejack's personality is too flat and she needs more screen time. I don't like Rainbow Dash because she reminds me too much of the jackass jocks that I had in my school, even if she does have a hidden heart. :/
alegr0bot do you agree with lyra and bon bon fic
I admit, MLP: FIM has alot of good music
Buytoast I'm putting this straight to you. A sex toy made as a troll joke
Gigabit Oooh my bad.
Only BBBFF song has grown on me, oh wait, CMC song
Oops, I forgot Smile Smile Smile, it's a consolation favorite.
I love those songs too~
I know about that one Canadian_Brony .
........
Ok, thats enough. Goodnight all. Have a good ome/
0,14>Best song
oh my
BBBFFF
but there's more than just that
Silverscreen: Applejack has a LOT of screentime.
0,14>not Love is in Bloom
Buytoast that be the one
I don't like competition, which is why I dislike Rainbow Dash
Goodnight Jaketehsnake!
0,14ya'll crazy
Saxy: Inorite.
g'night Jaketehsnake
1,11Let me rephrase that: She needs more stories involving her.

Is that the name of the podcast? The Robronies? Dang :P
Phase4, On mah way
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: What are your opinions on the obscene Lyra plushie?
Silverscreen: wait not resignation- but that.. attempt to reign in her anger. She got better, S3 might get her even better
00,02nyx.ariscop.net

emails?
I like Applejack because I find her the most supportive and openly caring for her friends. Rainbow Dash is too brash and blunt for me.

Awww....
you sure man?
CriticKitten: pop>opera? err no
noooo
1,11On the other hoof, I really LIKE applejack's character because she's so down-to-earth...
Think of a question
Silverscreen no pun intended?
What?
But that's what makes Applejack harder to explore.
Could you sing smile smile smile in nigel thornberry's voice?
What?
1,11No pun intended. XD
+Phase4 did you add me
lol
Silverscreen: YEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
new lays potato chip
Fluttershy's on your podcast. Impersonate her. Go.
Applejack's a great character, no doubt about that. But she's too stable to be explored effectively.
Silverscreen: yes it was
00,02TheKoreanBrony1354, dont think so, whats your steam name again?
No dynamics in her character, much as I love her.
MLP_M1KE13
YES

It just means we love you <3
Which of the Mane 6 you hope to see more in character development in Season 3?
I never really had any

Worst mane 6 pony?

Allegr0: Which pony would you rather ride into battle? Luna, Celesta, Twilight, Despair or Ruin?
1,11I LOVED the songs in The Canterlot Wedding, and aside from Smile, they are the best songs of the season. But PERSONALLY, my favorite songs are both of Rarity's (becoming popular and Art of the Dress)
is there such a thing as a worst mane 6?
I really need to change my name :S
Cypresswolf no
No, Cypress, there isn't.
Well that can't end well.
11,01pony_9790: is best pony.
alright annon pony!
worst mane six is still best pony
?
MUFFINS
Okay. I'll change my name right now
I thought so :)
i didn't like them :/
What happened?
Use /nick pony_9790
pony_9790: /nick yourself
Rainbow Dash...
lol
/me shares the same opinion as Silverscreen.
He left
or not
I actually want Applejack. She is the LEAST developed character in MLP.
Dude
now he is back
AppleJack development
1,11I want Scootaloo to have more development. She is nothing but a young Rainbow Dash right now.
There. Here I am :S
scootaloo <3
and song while were at it
More Applejack
as wowviewer
Either that or Zecora.
Ooh Zecora!
AJ needs dev, though
Silverscreen sonic orange boom O_o
DWR with voice. For reasons unknown.
fluttershy the best
Zecora should get an episode or two.
I guess we'll know when we see episode 3 of season 3
00,02TheKoreanBrony1354, i did
Where?
...Wut.
1,11At least Applebloom and Sweetie Belle have clear differences between their sisters. But Scootaloo is an obvious expy of RD.
pinkie pie should
It's kind of weird. I like hiding my nick lol
Soarin development?
0,14DWR works with art department
Fluttershy has had the least amount of screen time IIRC
I'd love that crippleloo episode, and that lost deerponyboy sode
+Phase4 can i join you
0,14same way that Allegro and Gigabit are with A/V department
00,02TheKoreanBrony1354, sure
Ah, well then cheers for doing that Saxy.
That's true
coool
I would like to see more of RD
Raibow Dash is so lame
Makes sense.
1,11I still say Sweetie Belle is the best CMC because she's more developed.
wowviewer: That was a GREAT question. Thanks for asking that!:)
We actually have departments now?
Silverscreen: I agree, what happened to Applebloom
Silverscreen: Ikr? And also Scootaloo is the only one of the Cutie Mark Crusaders that doesn't belonged to any relatives, What is she, an orphan? I DEMMAND ANSWERS!
i would like to see less of RD
mitamaking who is Raibow Dash?
And here I thought those were just names.
I always prefered Sweetie because of her voice and acting, but- yeah
Heh, no problem :)
had them for a while.
Sweetie Bell is best CMC cause voice cracks iz adorable
0,14Yeah
+Phase4 what the password
Canadian_Brony: :[
they give her too much screentime
Acting in animation = animation, not voice acting, btw
Could you guys please reply to the email I sent you two weeks ago, since I missed last week's show?
Well, I've never actually seen them in action.
00,02TheKoreanBrony1354, ponies
That's all.
I think Pinkie Pie has donew enough
Please?
*done
1,11Applebloom's personality is nothing but a single gig: "AH WANT MAH CUTIE MARK!" bleh.
No one has except the people in them.
hehehe
0,14btw, how have the podcasts been going? I've never been able to catch 'em aside from now
lol
She's a typical whiner kid
Throw a party!
but-- I still kinda like her
mitamaking she gets average screentime
More MvM anyone? one of Phases other servers.
theyve been going well
I'm still on nyx
har
1,11The only development from her was the Family Appreciation Day, and even that was more development for Granny Smith than for Applebloom.
Actually, she can do some things in the future. Remember in that one episode in the talent show, she fixed the tree house by herself
I would like to see more Twilight and Celestia information
I assumed Nyx lost too many folks to continue.
Been a while
MASF123: I don't know, Baby Cakes, Mmmystery, Friend in Deed
BronyCon department anyone?
We've got four on Nyx
:3
PIE HOLE
did her do my question
?
We're running many many engies and one money-grabber scout.
Twilight is shown too much
he*
oh it'a Allegr0 fiance I'm hearing?
0,14>_>
Hello everypony :P
There are signs, but there can be a side story for a much more deeper character development
allo Ponies47
1,11We don't need anymore Pinkie Pie episodes, and we've had enough Rarity episodes.
ello Ponies47
SaxyPretender: i know~
hi Ponies47
Ponies47: Hi!
I would like to see more Applejack episodes in Season 3, she is the only Mane 6 pony thats doesnt has her own song.
hey Ponies47
Could you guys please reply to the email I sent you two weeks ago, since I missed last week's show?
We have had 2 true Rarity episodes
1,11VenHur: YES!
What was the name?
Want to join up, Meanwhile?
VenHur absolutely
and i was there~
Val Vordox and I are currently on...whatever this one is. Idk if Vordox is actually paying attention though.
0,14XD
Wait, 3
Pinkie Pie, I think we all know about her and we love it! Rarity, I wouldn't mind seeing more episodes
lol
VenHur: Not only that, but she has the least character development.
1,11I want an Applejack Song! I have a feeling she'd sweep us away with a cute slow-country song.
:D
so maybe...
VenHur: whats rd's song again?
voice4meh?
I agree with VenHur. AJ needs actual amount of content.
I do want 2 pinkie and 2 Rarity episodes, but there's onl 13 this time
maybeh?
0,14=P
maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybeh?
Coming over, Meanwhile
AJ has an Amazing voice too, in Winter Wrap up at least
Vivix: That is not confirmed yet
superretroworld had a duet with fluttershy
I hope that if we get an Applejack song, it will have acoustic guitar.
hi Ninjazz|Sleep
Rarity and Applejack need more screentime
...nah im not doing that
Looking into it, hang around a mo.
mitamaking: I thought it was confirmed by Wil Anderson?
Ohey, Canadian_Brony.
And you know what? All of that of what I said makes Applejack my favorite pony, WHY YOU NO GIVE APPLEJACK A SONG?
. . .
heh
dat email
Vivix: I thought it was still a rumor
Dken2021: well not really her solo
Scootaloo episode, I tells ya
its just not fair to scoots
1,11Rarity has had 3 whole episodes to develope her personality. As much as I like her, I think she's had enough screen time.
0,14Cowboy hat > fedora
mitamaking: I don't think it is anymore, but he also said there's a reason, and that s4 is coming
0,14and I'll fight anyone who disagrees
OHDEARGOD STOP!!
. -.;
O_O
Silverscreen: 3 is a lot? Oh come on that is the same as AJ
OOHHH MMMYYY
Fedora. A FEDORA. Why not a fez? Fezzes are cool. I have that on good authority.
Applejack needsa sterotypical county song
Errr.... Well. Okay then :S
I agree.
SaxyPretender: Top hat & monacle > Cow boy hat
lol
SaxyPretender: I WILL FIGHT FOR THE FEDORA
Applejack has the most screentime than anypony, she's been in episodes that don't even concern her
Kencolt because Fedoras are awesome
Wait what?
twilight and fluttershy has had enough
Evening Ponies
AJ is in a lot, but she doesn't DO a lot, you know?
Oh deary
I feel like there are a lot of Mary Sue situations being made for this question :P
Dken2021: Not counting Twillight you mean
1,11mitamaking: But those three revealed deep and complex character traits for her character, where as others are just them learning a basic lesson and that's it.
Allegr0 don't ever say anything in that voice ever again.
0,14also, YOU WILL LOSE REIKIM
Whatever, fuck this dicussion.
myeeees see
I don't email
Of course I want more episodes focusing on all of the M6 as seasons progress, but AJ really needs an episode-
SaxyPretender: THE FEDORA SHALL KICK YOUR ASS
Dken2021: Screen time, yes, but not character development. She doesn't really DO anything.
maybe you need to plug your emails again
a lot of people look stupid in fedora's
Well... you do have a point Silverscreen
mitamaking well that was true in season 1 since she was the one to come up with the letters
AJ and SHY being at home, not adventuring
0,14THE FEDORA WILL LOSE
AJ just needs one episode, and a FREAKING song
Oh. I forgot I did that
where do you send a message, private messages on bs?
Fedora is mid teir
GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0: Did you also agree that Applejack needs more screen time and her own song (not counting her part in At The Gala) in Season 3?
THE FEDORA WILL BRUTALIZE THE COWBOY HAT
Vivix: Yeah. Derpy stole the Last Roundup.
MOBS EVERYWHERE WILL GATHER BEHIND IT
SaxyPretender: DO NOT QUESTION THE FEDORA >:I
constipation?
SaxyPretender, the Fedora will seduce the Cowboy Hat and they'll make children.
0,14I WILL QUESTION IT
0,14BECAUSE COWB-
AJIsAwesome: yeah- but that was a good AJ episode-
/me 13yawns
superretroworld: You hit their name twice and type a message from there
0,14Ninjazz|Away THAT'S BRILLIANT
Woo!
wowviewer: thanks
We'll see how SaxyPretender enjoys being on the recieving end of every single mobster in the world.
0,14Hello, sleepyhead
Hey Ninjazz!
SaxyPretender: NEVAH ; A;
superretroworld: No problem
ph wait
on the toilet?
Good evening, Shizu.
i like Ninjazz|Away's idea :3
Hey, Polydunami.
0,14Posses > Mobsters
SaxyPretender And then the Monocle/ Tophat will be the STEP DAD
11,01Allegr0, are you constipated?
13just finished vectoring out some textures from uru for my site
I did not die of diabetes fun fact
lol the fuck am i lissening
13going to look for more
Have fun with that.
Lol thanks, Derpy.
thrackerzod who the buck knows
1,11Applejack needs a family-focused episode that reveals how she sees the mane 6 as an extended family, and while she's deeply rooted to her family and traditional ways, she learns that going outside of tradition isn't always a bad thing. A semi-sad song would be included.
is he takin' a shit?
So I played the intro and a complete chapter of Dust
11,01Barbetos: Did you die of diabeetus?
I know it isn't a mane 6, but Spike's parents should be explored

1,11Applejack needs a family-focused episode that reveals how she sees the mane 6 as an extended family, and while she's deeply rooted to her family and traditional ways, she learns that going outside of tradition isn't always a bad thing. A semi-sad song would be included.

I dont care in quantity
Silverscreen: Then they would have to admit the parents....
A fedora has class
Saxy that joke was so bad I want to cause you physical harm.
Silverscreen: I would like to see that
SaxyPretender: why you hate my opinions? ; A;
A cowboy hat? Nothing.
0,14:3
My red hat > all

Atomic Punch!
Silverscreen: that's what Lauren suggested
Silverscreen: I personally prefer the sadder story, makes her and Big MAc a lot more important
Silverscreen: Agreed, they need to further expands the relationship between Applejack and Big Mac.
what kind of evil parents wouldn't send a check once in a while
Every hat in the world wishes it was the red mage hat.

*squee*

Now the K.O Answer.....
If I were to spend only 1 day in Equestria...I'd seek out Twilight Sparkle to cast a spell where I relive that same day over and over (Groundhogs Day style) and visit everypony until I get bored
Saxy's cowboy hats can't even compare.
They should just keep making that noise until they leave
0,14woah
squee
0,14woah
0,14you did not just diss my hat
IT'S HUGGGEEEE
1,11VenHur: that's what I mean by family-centric. AJ's and Mac's relationship isn't very well explained, and right now we see AJ as more of a mother figure to Applebloom rather than a sister.
I dissed it.
eeeyup
0,14hey
dat eeyup
0,14Reikim
I will diss your hat...AND your jacket.
0,14ARE YOU OKAY?
FTW
Woah
Silverscreen: WE NEED MORE BIG MAC
Woah
1,11...
nice little theory
GUYS
ENOUGH
Just because I think that a fedora and a waistcoat is just better
THIS IS BEST HAT http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Spongebob_2e3c24_3034520.png
Because CLASS.
I'm a science nerd, and I'm very lost
Shall I laugh
superretroworld: eeyup
nice
:D
Franek12354 eeyup
Silverscreen: I would make Applejack my favorite pony of the series if all of that is acomplished in an episode, hoofs down.
:D
I need a new brain
1,11I would love to have Big Mac suddenly spew off all that science mumbo jumbo and leave Twilight with a hanging mout. XD
eeyup
Pinkie Dying Pie?
1,11mouth*
It would be nice to see the actual story behind where AJ´s parents are
flutter_spin LOL
have you guys watched that epic rap battles of equestria video with big mac vs blueblood?
Tiiiiime
I like how Saxy's method of checking if people are OK involves hurting them.
Silverscreen . . . I would love to see that in the show!
top favourite are pinkie, applejack and fluttershy
I know what I'd do if I had one day in Equestria, I'd do all the stuff I'd want to do then in the last seconds kiss Big Mac before I vanish
villagers. I like that. Never thought of them that way.
well...
Visit Molestia
What about Fluttershy's and Rainbow Dash's parents?
no
Unnr: eeyup
2nd target?
Silverscreen: Hahah! Yeah, way out of character, but hillarity issues! Hahahaaaah!
If I go to equestria, I would invite the dragons over for a second chance
1,11Like, Big Mac is actually well learned in the Family Psychology and give Twilight a bit of a lesson on why Applejack is being such a pain.
I did not through you will read this all.....
you obviously dont know bout Terry Bogart
: D
good times.
unner Agreed. Am I the only one who wants the people behind MLP to make a darker episode?
I feel like taking a nap
I guess...
lol Canadian_Brony
Like one about how to deal with the death of a loved one?
Hmm...
Anyone?
feeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwww
0,14I thnk Jayson Thiessen said they're not doing dark.
ping me when it's over
LOL
/me falls asleep on the floor
Awwwww
1,11linsett: I don't think they should make MLP any darker than how Canterlot Wedding got.
linsett: Well they made it darker with the setting of "A Canterlot Wedding", WE NEED TO GO DEEPER THAN THAT!
I don't want a darker episode than they had with season 2 final
I'd prefer if they stick to their demographic instead of catering to us all the time
wtf was that!
LOL
This person thought this out
Big Mac will now be played by Hank Hill GigabitHarmonie =P
/me refuses to think about S3
/me goes back to sleep
one of the reasons I like this series is the escapism
not to mention the forst 2 episodes of the 2nd season was pretty dark
Alright then.
OMG its finishing...
if I wanted darker I'd watch regular TV
Silverscreen: a dog an pony show was pretty dark
1,11bringing darkness to a world of light is one thing. To turn the official material into another world of GrimDark would turn it to crap.
Well, I'ma gonna sleep now, Bye all!

doesnt Canterlot take a day to get to in some episodes?
lol, that Octavia correction
Silverscreen e-mails sent by Bronystate
I think that I should go to the Royal Canterlot Library (if permitted) or the Ponyville Library (if not) and research the actual known history of Equestria, it's more notable historical characters, and most of all the relationship between a Amniomorphic Array and Arcanopathic Flows, in relation to Thaumaparticular transference. Oh, and pick up as much cider as I possibly could. And some muffins.

Allegr0, GigabitHarmonie: Wake up, find Rainbow Dash in your room. What do?
Allegr0: well it doesn't matter, your stream keeps cutting in and out for me like a bad signal it's aggravating as hell.

Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie . . . whatabout Canada?!?!?!?!:?
If I go to equestria, I would head to west fillydelphia to play some hoofball, but then all the local ponies might not like me in their neighborhood, go in one little fight and Celestia would be scared and move my uncle and aunt to the moon

1,11bleh. Don't like those kind of games. They bore me.
So its DOTA, if you were directly controlling the main guy
you place Towers which attack the enemy who enters in rounds and attempts to go from Point A to Point B. The towers can be upgraded and the enemies have health. If a certain amount of enemies reaches Point B, you lose.
THAT is a Tower Defense
in a nutshell

TO THE BOOKS!!
0,14on both remarks

You imply they ever had senses.
Jupiter has moons?
13i do not have senses
0,14I can smell and taste
0,14that's TWO senses
Fuck Google, I have a BOOK!!
Oops
GigabitHarmonie Old man Google always knows.
Like I said.
I mean, they are more senseless than usual.
oh, makes sense
NERD ftw
See, Shizu is a robot.
I don't even have Steam. I don't WANT steam. Steam has nothing to offer me.

Uh... I pass on that question :S
Quick, to DOGPILE!
I can't contact them

Somehow
I have no Steam....sadface....
11,01I come from a time when there was no Google.
Shizu being a soulless automaton makes sense.
lol

11,01and Ask.com

lol yeah
Nittany_Discord: you can´t forget altavista

DAMN! THE GUY ON MY EMAIL THING SAID YOU'VE GOT MAIL REALY LOUD!
0,14you ever hear of Ghosts in the Shell?
0,14HMMMM
11,01And one with a dog.
Shizuka was sent back in time to kill John Connor. But she got distracted and instead decided to watch Friendship is Magic.
And Steam has nothing to offer me... none ofthe games they have interest me. Sigh.
my books tell me nothing
Nittany_Discord: dogpile
*nods*
Allegr0 I looked. I seem to have lost mine =(
goddamit
And the rest is history.
11,01No.
But Ghost in the Shell
also Northren Lights
Ghost in the Shell wasn't robots, Saxy.
11,01It had a dog for a mascot.
It was CYBORGS.
That's ok Nit. My mom's friend told me he refuses to use anything google because he says they record and watch you type.

back in my day I had keyword search from AOL
It's been years since I saw it.
i came from a time where there was no mlp g4, infact, you all shared the same fate
11,01I want to say Incite, but I'm probably wrong.
11,01Dken2021: Yep.
Either way, Shizu is a cold, unfeeling robot ;_;
I've never seen Ghost in the Shell. Except for maybe like, once when it was on stream.
I meant steam.
lol
Oh, Nittany_Discord Lycos?
0,14Ah, AOL
Shizu's not unfeeling. Just very low-key about it.
0,14that takes me back
I bet
11,01Unnr: That's it.
I bet Shizu runs the site right out of her head.
The answer is Pluto!
Hehehe, what about HotBot?
/me is intimidated and impressed
11,01And dial-up only allowed you to be connected for a set number of hours.
I rember buffering for a 3 minute video was like half an hour
or All The Web
11,01Not unlimited like today.
man, All the Web had such a great name
0,14Standard reaction to a woman
11,01Unlimited if you ignore download caps.
13especially a woman armed with lethal pool noodles
13"unlimited"
Unlimited if you ignore the fact it's limited
lol
o.o
MY AOL- back in the day-- did have an unlimited time option. But... who needed to spend tat much time on the net back then?
whoa O.o
I had dialup like last week, then I got high speed. FUCK YEAH!
A robot woman armed with pool noodles.
THIS. IS. SERIOUS!!!
this is serious u guys!!!
11,01Some ISPs don't use download caps.
serious bwsniuess
Shizuka: indeed
My standard reaction to a woman is the same as my reaction to a man.
Which is discontent.
"Ponce"?
/me 11,01hugs Shizuka and her pool noodle.
And yeah ponce works too.
Fluttershy777 you must've drooled when you noticed the sudden speed change
Oh god Joker voice
My ISP has no caps.
Dken2021 Yes, yes I did.
Hey now. It's your birthday...
Oh, you know the answer. I don't know the names of the moons in Jupiter :S
I know the answer but i dont want the game
<@Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some ISPs don't use download caps. <- mine is only 200 GB a week
Comcast has a download cap, but it's really hard to hit.
LOL
whoa whoa double blue
pfft, was just a quote
Moons of Jupiter include: Metis, Adastrea, Amalthea, Thebe, Io, Europa, Callisto, Ganymede, Leda, Himalia, Lysithea, and about 50 more

But I did find it. Want to know?
can't quote mods without getting kicked
so
It's ***********
11,01Prince_Blueblood: Well, Verizon back in PA had no cap.
:(
Each entry give us ONE chance right?
:P
Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: STOP YOU VIOLATED THE LAW
Bronystate guards are going to be breaking in your doors soon.
11,01200 GB / week isn't that bad.

Awww, it was nice watching you guys agian.
They will yell "Stop you criminal scum!"
I'm on Xfinity. WHich is run by Comcast. What's the DL cap?
nono Prince_Blueblood , I didn't know you could do that. It confused me
11,01I think Comcast had 300 GB / month.
wish I could do port forwarding here
but I'll live with it
youre sick?
Allegr0, <3
11,01Which is more strict.
Nittany_Discord: isnt' that bad? that's awesome, I saw the goddamn limit on Verizon is goddamn only 80gb a MONTH
*again
time warner cable has unlimited download cap
Oh wow
Comcast WAS 250gb/month, fixed. then they bumped it to 300GB with overage charges
Thank you GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0 for the always awesome stream.
0,14So, Allegr0, ARE YOU OKAY?
I'm sorry :S
As far as I'm concerned everyone is a twonk until proven otherwise.

mine is 200GB/week
/me hugs streamers

11,01otakon: That's for Verizon in your area.

Everybody hates sonicandmario85
did bronystate do some new rcruiting recently?
Allegr0: As are you. But tbh Giga has a sexier voice.
First I make Saxy hate me bby stating the truth regarding cowboy hats and fedoras.
Newsflash!
And now Meanwhile.
recruiting*
sonicandmario85: And who can blame 'em.
Meanwhile: <3
Meanwhile what athing to say!
=P
Meanwhile I see how it is....
/me is a sad pony
sonicandmario85 are you original character blonicandblario85?
yea everyone hates me because im annoying and im just trying to be funny ):
But then, I could have rustled Meanwhile's jimmies just by stating that Trixie is best pony.
i think your voice is sexy Allegr0
Allegr0 why u sad? You obviously have the brains.
Allegr0 Y U sad? Did I misss something? Watch Whose Line! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXT6foyWZCw
Nothing personal Allegr0, but if you were both trapped in seperate elevators and I had to cut the cable on one to save the other, you'd be a pavement pancake.
Allegr0, drink some fluids and get some rest don't be a sick pony :3
LunarSS ;)
Brains are sexier these days
Twilgiht is best pony
Allegr0: lots of water
Canadian_Brony no, just joshing with Meanwhile
damn i can't use a keyboard today
Trixie can eat glass shards.
Meanwhile: Oh god lol
/me sobs at Barbetos comment.
Man, so much Trixie hate
I can't even understand why.
Allegr0 watch Whose Line anyway. Best. Newsflash. Ever.
BATTLE OF THE MOOBS!

GigabitHarmonie wut? You already have the gift of sexy voice. you cant have your cake and eat it. I am sorry. =P
I tab-failed
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, Twilight is best pony /)
I find Trixie has her place.
The fandom's need to make her more than she is is the only thing that annoys me.
like I always do
dat trixie disccusion seems to appear every now and then
Her character grinds my gears, she is the very epitome of what I despise and I would run over my own legs with a steamroller if I thought it'd make her stop existing.
thats what fandoms do though,
right Ponies47?
Where is the tab key in this?
/me says as he writes a Trixie fanfic
anyways, night everypony :P
I hate fandom.

Niye Wolfmane
You ARE a fandom, Meanwhile
:3 Not sure if they're doing requests anytime soon - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6b0CretuE - here's a little bedtime story read by Samuel L Jackson
Also, why Phase, why
Says you.
I smell like fish now.
Barbetos Hi nice to meet you
Barbetos NO!! Whose Line! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXT6foyWZCw

I'm drinking gatorade at 12:42 at night. O_O
Just go the **** to sleep :P
SAMUEL L FUCKING JACKSOOOOOOOOOOOON
niye? derp:P
Why must I smell like fish?
Reikim, it was the hypocricy fish
To be fair
:)
TO BE FAIR
Barbetos Hi
i hit people with it when they're being hipocrits
I'm not writing it off my own ideas.
and i cant spell, so fairs fair
Hello MALK
Everyone, you wake up to Discord on one side of you and Chrysalis(fail spelling?) on the other. Who do you turn to face?
Nice to meet you too
Fluttershy777 pls i drink 2 gatorades almost everynight
Reikim, point is your writing it
Well, I'm writing it off my own ideas, based loosely on a terrible idea given me by a friend on FanFic who can't write
You in a brony group Barbetos?
\
Well, I'm going to do it well.
CiderIsForDrinking - Pinkie Pie, at the foot of the bed, obviously
MALK Bronystate I suppose?
The problem is that the fandom sees things in Trixie that aren't there to begin with.
good, its hard to find a good trixie fic
I'd hug Celestia who is on top of me, CiderIsForDrinking :3
Barbetos like a local one where you meetup?
I'm rewriting it for the second time.
i've not found one that isnt trixie/twi shipping
:D
Argh
Raggle fraggle.
That ship pisses me off SO MUCH
Phase4 what type do you want ? redemption shipping or sad ending ?
Pinkie pie is watching you sleep
Anyway
ANYWAY
:D
kiling me wont bring your honey BACK!!!!
No no no, no "anyway"
Why?
I wrote six chapters and now I'm starting from scratch.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, the interesting kind
NOT THE BEES
Yes it will
cachi01|mobile I drink like 5 every day. :P
wouldnt mind pinkie watching me sleep
is stream dead again?
Reikim, why?
Okay
MALK not really.
stupid internet
Let's see if I can explain this.
no ones streaming
speaking of Pinkie Pie... whatever happened to that Ace Attorney / MLP video series from months back?
:) Wait til after Return of the King tomorrow night - I have the perfect video to share with all of you :)
Fluttershy777 THEY R BUCKING DELICIOUS
dum internet
The original idea starts with Trixie having a son.
o_O
A bastard with some noble.
MirrorImage episode 4 is being made
(this isn't my bloody idea, by the way)
Phase4 objective does not compute
cachi01|mobile Yes they are. :)
Cypresswolf: and you will know my name is the lord, when i lay my vengeance apon thee
You mean Turnabout Storm? It's taking a while for the next episode
But its taking its time :(
Phase4.exe has stopped working.
And it's actually Episode 3: Twilight.
cachi01|mobile - i assumed as much, but it's been... 2 months? or more
And then said noble's father wants to sacrifice him to turn himself into a god.
it's a fan project
TOONAMI IS ON
what do you expcet?
Turnabout Storm - Episode 4 will release after Episdoe 3 - Twilight
MALK: yay!
superretroworld: Fuck Yes!
what
the
apples
meh you lost me
This god form would be called his "Cosmos Alicorn" form
I thought they cancelled episode 3 twilight
By the way
eh... too much obviously
btw i gots mlp osters, yay
Yes it's cheesy and I hate it
alright, time for this pony to rest up. Thanks for tuning in and I'll see you guys later!
*posters
it more or less went dark as far as i knew
The guy giving it to me is an idiot.
No, just the game
bai Allegr0
you got me with son and you lost me with god
Evidently.
seeya Allegr0
... Wait, I mean the sequel to Turnabout Storm
bye Allegr0
Also the mane6 get involved at some point.
Cya allegr0
At the beginning.
BAI ALLEGR0
Goodnight Allegr0.
so going through my cable channels...
Reikim, ok... you cant really sell the god bit
Before I rekindle my murderous rage at people I don't know,
g'night Allegr0
Johnny Bravo is on Boomerang
I won't explain all of it because it's full of plotholes and stupid.
Thank you, Allegr0, for the entertainment
but you could make everything else interesting
Sec
SAMURAI 7 on TOONAMI
I'm getting to that bit
And insights :3
night Allegr0
What've you got against Twixie shipping?
don't even know what Samurai 7 is...
A GOOD SHOW BEING BROADCASTED IN BOOMERANG?
SAMURAI SEVEN!?
Also he wanted to give Trixie a massive and meaningless power boost.
twilight_sprinkle: do you have the comic con 2011 group?
/me blindly hits go to Cartoon Network
WHAT IS THIS SPARTA
I'll get to Meanwhile's point in a bit.
Now
that a good show?
ITS A NEW ANIME ON TOONAMI
I decided there were some redeeming factors, so I start writing it.
Oh, I thought it was the actual movie
cachi01|mobile:they show some old show son boomerang..
NO Im just going to watch TOONAMI
New direction, giving Trixie and her son more personality, exploring Trixie's reasons for her arrogance, etc.
Phase4 i like this one http://www.fimfiction.net/story/3846/Festival
superretroworld: hmm, idk tbh, i left them at my apartment without getting a proper look yet. its the 4 free posters at walmart
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhsCp5HgxSk Twilightliscious
aww, if only I had cable ;_;
They show classic live action shows on a channel called MeTV where I live
Six chapters in, just recently, I decided I don't like it anymore.
Well, gtg guys, getting late...
It's not what I want.
So I'm revising again.
today on Samurai 7 - rice collecting montage
sonicandmario85 just for 1 hour and then its a channel for teenage justin bieber fan girls
Bye VenHur
My end goal is to tell a story from two fronts.
but it incomplete and last chapter got a bad twist by bringin discord
Dafuq
twilight_sprinkle: i didnt know they had them at wal mart, thats awsome
Dken2021: you dont need cable if you have the internet
We've got Hawaii Five-O and Cannon
or i'm getting mixed with other fic
The CLASSIC Five-O, mind you
superretroworld: theyre supposed to, but i had to go to three walmarts until i found one that had them
The first is to tell the story of Trixie's son (Luxor) as he enters into the real world and becomes acquainted with the realities of Life, all while coming of age. He's been hospitalized his whole life, by the way.
The other half of the story is Trixie's end.
oh
She has to relearn how to distinguish between illusion and reality.
Specifically, her own self-illusions.
Slenderman slenderman. Does whatever a slender can
We should play Family Feud!
Oh, and we have Bonanza and Gunsmoke
So I'll get to explore the relationship of illusion and reality quite deeply, which will be satisfactory.
*satisfying
hmmm
:) Don't forget to brush your teeth! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtGyequDXDo
Spider slender man Spider Slender man does whatever a spider slender man does
Her character arc will culminate in discovering what her cutie mark actually means
Phase4 also look for The balad of twlight sparkle, Adored and 	Teardrops and Snowflakes
It is illusion.
100 people were asked this question: Who is best pony?
So anypony here has played super robotnik land?
Trixie becomes mistress of illusion.
no
Do it
This is her role as a stage magician.
Its hilarious
Polydunami PINKIE PIEEEEEE
13any ponies for mvm?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, think i've read the first one
i can tell its a sonic game about robotnik/eggman LOL by the name
Polydunami Fluttershy
Why must you ask at 6 in the morning...
13any ponies who don't need to sleep~
Ah, bugger it I didn't want to sleep anyway.
Now now, it's one answer at a time :)
eh i'll join
And then there are bits like how all reality is percieved, and if Trixie is to be the illusionist than she must be aware of the reality, and that Trixie is the only one able to see the truth
Stuff liek that
*like
Pinkie Pie!
YEEES
0,14I'll join in spirit

HELL NAW
Actually, this counts as RP, doesn't it?
/me takes a deep breath
what does?
I was pissing with files
And that kind of somewhat outlines what I'm going to do with this terrible idea.
Phase4 also i'm reading Gettin' Back On Her Hooves
Acting like the host of Family Feud
LOL
If I ever finish, Phase4, I'll let you know.
and Longest Night, Longest Day
/)_(\
Heck I'll let you betaread.
Canadian_Brony do not be mean to the flys.
I need a beta who isn't incompetent.
Speaking of which, I must say Rest in Peace, Richard Dawson
PP > TS > RARITY = AJ > FS > RD
I was moving files around my computer. F I L E S
Meanwhile can attest to the incometence of the guy who threw me the idea.
Who pinged me twice before?
fillies*
Oh. DERP.
*incompetence
stream died -saaadface-
Raggle fraggle.
oh derp indeed
I have no idea why you keep saying that.
0,14Billy and Mandy reference?
Reikim i'll let you know that the llusionist trixie is a cliche right now
Like if I bang my hand on the doorframe.
Colt_45 don't cry
What
I feel like such a retard.
gooby pls
so.. what to talk about?
Hey Everypony
And here I thought I came up with a way to save the idea.
Well, it makes sense.
hi Toxic_Mysticaura
allo Toxic_Mysticaura
Ponies47, when the chat derps, the scroll function locks up; the sound you hear is actually every new message being typed off screen.
I don't know if anyone's explored the idea fully yet, though.
Right now? Illusionist Trixie has been cliché since the character appeared.
Or competently.
13Refresh your streams ponies
Fluttershy777 don't say that to urself man
Mistress of Illusion, thanks much.
I'm taking the idea to another level, I like to think.
Flattershi don y u fel ritared?
ah some mvm?
ponies_8989 Why not...

Reikim if you read any fic from the Lunaverse you get trixie is an illusionist student of luna element of magic
Dat TF2
I can't! Play! TF2~~
!!!
Lunaverse?
It's free though
Aaarrrgghh!!!
luna instead of celestia
Well I don't follow that.
my computer won't run Steam games
his video cards shitty like mine
and pretty much the elemnts are different
11,01http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.384992-BioWare-Defends-DLC-Business-Strategy?page=5#15327836 <- My thoughts exactly.
thats what hes saying
yeah same here
But good pc aint free
Oh
no my video card is fine
hell, it's damn good
I would get TF2, but don't want to overburden this laptop anymore
Look, has anyone actually completely explored the relationship between illusion and reality using Trixie as a vehicle?
I was just playing MvM :P
In most fics, I find, it's all just about powers.
good pc is moneydriven just like anything else in this world
I need a keyboard that supports rollover before I play TF2
rollover?
rollover? What does that mean?
^
It's not just about giving Trixie powers, because I've seen that, it's stupid, that's what the original idea-creator wanted to do.
It's shallow.
FUCK THATS ALL YOU NEED IS WASD KEYS A MOUSE AND A SPACE BAR
caps not required.
For me it would be the [;'\ keys :P
And that's about all there is to say on the matter.
but how will you switch guns? :O
and f, r, q, e, z, x, c, and v
qwerty
Moving on to the older question about Twixie shipping.
And sometimes Y!
and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
And also you need R, 123456789, v, tab
for Spy, Engie, and weps
...
I'm not even entirely sure on that count.
And shit tons of other things
y and u for chatting
v for mic
Unless it's a farm!
I just don't see Twixie shipping working in a completely sane environment.
I'll join you guys if you need a extra player
HOW DO YOU MAKE ANIMATIONS ON DAT
basically, all you need is the right half of a keyboard and 1-0. (0 for cancelling spy menu)
I'm more likely to call her Asuka, tbh :S
sonicandmario85 get an animated pic and put it in
F is for the f that does f f f f f u is for u and u n is for n n here in th blue sea
Sorry, my internet completely died.. What happened during the livestream?
AJIsAwesome not much.

WTF is dat
Then HL3 reveal trailer
You missed Newborn Cuties, AJIsAwesome :P
Anyonw know what Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie were talking about?
MASF123 Team Fortress 2: Mann vs Machine
Then news about justin bieber being dead
I missed the last 10 minutes.
Reikim depends i do know cause twixie is my fav ship :p
My user name is odd...
AJIsAwesome of the podcast?
I just don't see it happening.
cachi01|mobile: Wut.
Canadian_Brony: Yes.
AJIsAwesome didn't really miss much, other than giga and allegr0 leaving
Beyond my general dislike of Mane 6 shipping.
I mean, what impetus is there?
ehhh is mostly the rival thing that every anime seems to have
Did they ask any more questions?
no
Trixie is not Twilight's rival.
Don't you dare suggest that.
este burrito esta muy bueno pero le falta salsa verde
AJIsAwesome Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie said thanks to everypony, then left. After some non-stream, we got TF2: MvM
rival antagonist enemy whatever term you like
Twilight herself has dismissed the notion.
Canadian_Brony - well... we will eventually
cachi01|mobile Engrish plz!
they've been standing around for about 10 minutes now
my english is not good enough to explain myself fully
Thanks. Aw man. I would've loved to have said goodbye.:'(
Trixie is a hack magician who trades in illusion and deceit.
I think they're waiting for a 6th player
What does faltar mean again?
Maids vs Maid-machines
i would've joined them, but the server is password protected
She is also arrogant, deluded, and most importantly, completely devoid of common sense.
Faltar is uhmmm i forgot lol
it means missing
so you are going to follow cannon
^
cachi01|mobile: That's fantastic!
applejack was the password last time
Twilight, on the other hand, is potentially the most powerful unicorn to ever exist.
Yes, I follow canon.
MirrorImage ask the mods for the password. They'll let you in.
So no, there is no rivalry.
Oh dammit
It's been four years since I took Spanish last :S
Now I've unconsciously started drawing up alternate scenarios.

Your quite muscluar person
... I don't want to look like David Hasselhoff :P
did i just hear "Zecora shaking her ass?"
I tend to loathe shipping in the MLP verse in the majority of cases.
Like Rainbow Dash style shipping?
Why not? He's gets all the bitches
Liek that.
*Like
Exceptions: Vinyl x Octavia
^ Favourite ship
Ship everypony with everypony just to see it happen.
theres not gonna be fame
and suddenly dead
MirrorImage: I heard that too.........:O
I've done that
It's bloody painful.
And theres not gonna be bitches
11,01Most shippings don't make sense.
I'd like to see someone try the advanced waves of this.
The thought of "getting all the bitches" scares me to be honest :S
11,01Especially Mane 6 shippings.
Wb.
Buytoast - i did...
it failed
miserably
11,01Why ship friends?
Yes, Nitt.
It's brutal beyond decency.
I don't like Mane6 shippings on principle.
protip - 6 Engie team is super effective on Normal only...
although what i'd love to see is a 3/3 team of engies and heavies
I wanna play this!
yay more TF2
I'd do it with you Buytoast if you would do it
allt he heavies have xaio-long blasters and destroy projectiles
I'm only fine with RarityXMane6 ones. >_>;
Wonder why God hasn't killed me yet? :/
11,01I wish I had more pyro flamethrowers.
Now, something like Touhou, that's a far better ground for shipping.
heavies protect the sentries, sentries destroy everything
MLP? Not really.
I'd try it, but probably not tonight.
But my stupid computer refuses to get the game running.
Rain falls on everypony, guy :$
I mean the weather
I only support Vinyl x Octavia, and Berry Punch x Colgate because really Ruby Pinch is just too damn cute.
11,01Actually, I only have the base pyro flamethrower.
I have NOTHING
where's the tank? I thought this was a Tank round?
Dat phlog
Wait, there are people who live in the desert. NEVER MIND o_O
I also once shipped Big Mac and Cheerilee, but only briefly, in passing, and out of convenience more than anything else.
a surprisingly effective spy tactic is Big Earner + Health on Kill + Dead Ringer
Nittany_Discord: Same here :P
for mvm
11,01The only fanon ship that I may be OK with is Lyra x Bon Bon.
11,01The others are friendships.
I like that one too.
Look at the health bar
*stab* *stab* *stab* *Dead Ring* *Disguise* *stab* *stab* *stab*
rackin' up the kills, eh Shizuka?
You know, I still don't really understand VinylxOctavia.
Damn
But inside the Mane 6? No, just no.
Vinyl x Octavia started as a joke.
It grew from there.
Uncharted logic: trapped in desert? Dont worry you can survive after 4 days without water and walking all th time
11,01I'd like to practice with Spy on a normal mission.
XAX - yes, but that doesn't recharge your Dead Ringer AND your Hit Points
I like didos
I LOVE DIDOS
But just because they're musical ponies?
11,01Shizuka: Modded HUD?
The joke is that Octavia is a classy traditional instrumentalist.
Why did i misread that?
While Vinyl is a hardcore electronic DJ.
i don't think Shizuka is actually watching IRC
13FrankenHUD
...neverind
13IRC is on screen two as always
11,01cachi01|mobile: I about did as well.
Who DOESN'T JUST PLAY DUBSTEP, I am obligated to add.
They are therefore as opposite as you will get.
Shizuka dual monitor /)
the ONLY way to chat!
11,01I was thinking of kicking him too sadly. Sorry MALK.
Exactly.
Throw two types like that into a small, confined space, and laughter ensues.
11,01It would have been my bad.
/me Wants to do daul monitor when he gets a new computer
???
dual monitor fancy
Hollywood has been abusing that for decades.
Shipping them is even more ludicrous, thus it will happen.
i can techincally dual monitor right now - my tv has a VGA port that i can use for SD picture
Ponies47 it is SO bucking useful!
So it's a sitcom ship. o_O
Nittany_Discord why would you kick him?
Personally, I'm not too sure on their relationship; they might be best buds, but they might also be getting some tension beyond that.
Canadian_Brony: I should. When I get a new computer :3
Yes.
Canadian_Brony: I got my old CRT monitor that came with my old computer I got in 2004 and hooked it up to my graphics card. Dual monitors are indeed sick.
Yes it is.
hi SuperBrony64
Kick who?
11,02Hai LoGaN :3
...I can buy that.
Vinyl x Octavia does boil down to a sitcom ship.
11,02I see you only noticed me because mah Xbox 360 is on :3
That
i see your on xbox
That's actually a really good way of describing it.
Dat Demoman plot
/me takes notes.
Holy crap. It is!
11,01Because I misread what you said and thought you were doing immature spamming.
I want a CPU only because i already have a monitor
Moo :3
Shake it!
/me is now imagining an entire show like Epic Wub Time with canned laughter.
Screen*
eh...I don't even know anymore. T_T
XAX I have a good widescreen monitor as my primary and I recently hooked up a small VGA monitor. I need to piss around with the colour settings on it, but otherwise it's awesome!
Oh ok Nittany_Discord I know what you mean now
Bass Cannon
Qualifies as a WMD.
/me 11,01wish he had a rainblower too.
^
That doesn't look like a tank
Canadian_Brony: My old CRT has never had any problems :D love the thing
It stopped Discord.

Sup Everypony!
Nittany_Discord: What would thou trade for one?
hey Aircrafter! :)
Aircrafter :D
There are Tanks in TF2?

11,01XAX: Dunno.
Howdy Aircrafter
hi Aircrafter. Shizuka is playing Mann vs Machine
11,01MASF123: Only in MvM.
MASF123: Just for MvM
I stand corrected!
11,01What do you want XAX?
WHat? From L4d?
/me glomps Canadian_Brony , MALK , XAX, and Ponies47.
11,01No. Mechanical tanks.
/me Hugs Aircrafter back :3
11,01Watch stream.
MASF123: mann vs machine. new mode
yay late night biscuits!
Oomph!
isn't the Rainblower craftable?
11,01MirrorImage: Dunno.
All this crafting confuses me
My stream lags too much for me to see. I'll refresh it now.
Quick, what is a place/location that is known for being seldom used?
SEE!?!
11,01I didn't see it as craftable earlier today.
Froggy Bottom Bog or whatever they call it.
MirrorImage Nittany_Discord Yes, you could try your luck with weapon and slot tokens
and a scrap
Agh
No
Hmmm?
Canadian_Brony - i should...
I mean, not actually used
Decided to request a vhost :$
when the Sharp Dresser came out, i got one on my first token craft
made a tidy profit that day
Not as in used in fanfiction
11,01The only time you I don't have enough stuff to craft tokens.
As in, people almost never use it.
...
Or actually
11,01And a run-on sentence.
How about a really stupid kitchen utensil?
it would take 3 craftable Primary weapons, 3 crafatble Pyro weapons, and whatever gives you a scrap.
11,01I don't have enough stuff to craft tokens.
you know... just for shiggles, i should go try a token craft...
A potatoe masher?
i've got 3 strange axtinguishers that no one will want that i could use for the pyro token
Please.
you have a 1/4 chance of getting a Rainblower
Those are used all the time.
>.<
Meanwhile keeps wasting his ammo :P
You keep wasting my ammo. >:I
O.O
11,01I could use more strange weapons. I thought you could only buy strange weapons.
The inverse of a rice cooker, basically.
11,01The only strange items I have are from trades.
Nittany_Discord - buy or get them from crates
A rice uncooker?
which is essentially buying them...
errr... buy as in trade
I always just trash my crates.
either way, off to try and make a rainblower!
okay guys I'm out
it's 1 am
In terms of utility.
Cta otakon
Night otakon :)
Strange weapons can be found by opening crates with keys. You can buy the keys in the Mann Co. Store or via Trading. The crates come in random drops or via trading.
Cya*
night otakon
I'm a bit bored since I can't get TF2 to work proper atm
seeya otakon
11,01I traded a flaming crate for 3 strange weapons.
Mmmm. That's what you mean by stupid.
otakon: Night!
11,01I know how crates work.
Nittany_Discord: how come you're UI looks differnt?
11,01This is Shizuka streaming, and she's using a mod.
I got the equivalent of a REFINED just by selling crates I collected
Nittany_Discord: oh that explains the Pyro
AHAHAHA
oh god, i did it!
Nittany_Discord, you need a rainblower?
vinyl scratch is best ponny
i crafted a rainblower!
Shizuka: GO GIRL GO! BURN IT ALL!
11,01I'd like a rainblower.
MirrorImage bullshit!
Gragh! I got nothing.
Want one for free? I've got an extra.
Shizuka is a dang good Pyro O.O
whats up
11,01Jmo4267: Sure.
do i need to have shizuka display the item to prove it?
Nothing much Heathgamer :P
cool
Aight, lemme throw you an add on steam.
Why does that guy saying "Kaboom" remind me of playing the battleship knockoff in Wind Waker?
So if i get some sticks and some cobblestone i can make a TF2 Pickaxe?
goodnight everypony! including SuperBrony64
13enjoying the show?
hi Heathgamer Shizuka is streaming Mann vs Machine and we're discussing weapons
0,14...cannot unhear, Polydunami
Polydunami: that's not kaboom
Shizuka buck yeah!
Shizuka: Yesh :3
Polydunami: that's SPLOOSH
That's fine, I came up with something else.
11,02Night LoGaN :)
13this is Trance Around the World #270 you're hearing
Shizuka: wonderful fun with flames
g'night LoGaN
#270?
Yes Shizuka
what about #1 - #267?
Night LoGaN :)
who is shizuku?
But when you hit a big octo, otakon, he goes KABOOM!
11,01I also wish I had an extra Huntsman to craft a medic crossbow.
and #268 and #269 since i obviously can't type
Heathgamer a mod
A freezer box that slowly warms things?
11,01Or the medic crossbow.
Shizuka: Yes!
link me
Gimme a few minutes Nittany_Discord, in a match.
11,01Jmo4267: OK.
Nittany_Discord Crusader's Crossbow. I think I have one kicking around my pack.
I didn't realize a song was playing :S
11,01I have 5 ubersaws XD
I made my own MvM server and locked it with a password. i played by myself in MvM! it was awesome! XD
11,01I actually used one in a craft.
I died alot...
11,01I used 3 extra crit colas as well.
eh, i just use the Create Server button in game when i want to MVM
And failed alot...
This has a pretty neat tune
Ambience
Guess I should of invited a few to join in :$
The knobs on a television set.
turns out it's really not that hard to make a temporary server when you actually know what you're doing in a router
leave the port forwarding set permanently and it's 3 console commands to have your server open to the general public
. . . I just found out I have a Phlogistinator.
wow
??
Explain?
me?
or canadian?
No, I was looking for a definition of Phlogistinator
the flamethrower shizuka is using
the laser flamethrower
Oh
yeah
you want stats?
wait... who is streaming
shizuka is
Shizuka?
oh
Yes.
No, I'm fine without specs :P
hi Panda. Eeyup
I need to get more space for my backpack. I keep having to delete other things to make room :(
i need to find someone to buy all my crates
school is starting back its going to suck
i've got about 1 page full of them right now
Ponies47: welcome to skyrim
11,01I wonder. If I use a strange item in a craft, will the item I craft be strange as well?
/me scratches his head. "I'm not sure how this game works."
Ponies47 hmm, you're running F2P
got crates too. anyone wanna?
and not enough free cash to just say "eff it" and buy all those keys
Nittany_Discord - no
Nittany_Discord no it won't be
Nittany_Discord: I dun tink so :c
How do you craft on TF2 anyways?
Heathgamer: IKR
Panda - the "Craft" button
Canadian_Brony: Yeah. Is there a problem? :$
its basically glorified cooking with a cookbook
it tells you what to throw in and tells you what you'll get out
repeat about 20 times per item
Ponies47 no. I ran F2P for the first few months of playing.
DAT RHYTHMIC WEAPON SWAP
why do you need a flair gun?
superretroworld - why not?
MirrorImage no i mean... like... does it tell you what it makes?
superretroworld long-distance damage
Panda - most of the time
oh
Canadian_Brony: I see. I just need to buy somthing from the store to make more space in my backpack correct?
there's two types of crafting - Token and Not-Token
MirrorImage Ive never tried, im still quite a noob :( forgive me.
token stuff takes non-token crafting for a brief moment, and at the final step decides randomly what to give you
Goodnight everypony.
g'night Polydunami

11,01You know what's funny? Baloonicorn being $18 in the store.
Pootis!
Nittany_Discord O_O it is?
Nittany_Discord: O_O
Nittany_Discord - you're surprised about that and not the Something Special for Someone Special?
11,01I think so.
Someone gifted me a balloonicorn O_O
11,01MirrorImage: Is that the think that sends a message to everyone in the game?
yes
for $100
not a typo
11,01Shit.
one-zero-zero
I'm pretty most of the people that have Baloonicorns are bronies most likely renamed it to either Twilight Sparkle or Rarity :P
Ah yess, the $100 ring in the Mann Co Store
the shop guys are insane
11,01That's outrageous.
Dark_Horst - and evil geniuses too
Or pinkie pie <_<
Buytoast: what'S that?
11,01I could go nuts on a steam sale for $100.
how much pure money did Valve make off of that item?
the funny part is valve has made thousands off that ring
Buytoast - i'd easily peg it at over $700k
That's okay, such confusion tends to be normal around me at this hour.
because we're idiots like that <_<
A ring...for $100...that does what?
Nothing
11,01Sad truth about gamers: The average gamer is a terrible consumer.
13i am so overpowered X3
it's purely cosmetic
Sorry, never played TF2. What ring are you talking about?
Shizuka: O.O
Buytoast: ....-triple over 9000 facepalm-
AJIsAwesome - back on valentines day
i make it a standard not to pay anything for a f2p game
valve released an item to the store
for $100 - "Something Special for Someone Special"
Speaking of purely cosmetic useless shit.
Who wants a free hat.
you gift it to someone, like a wedding ring
Buytoast: Pwease? :3
and it pops up a message across all serves about the exchange
Nittany_Discord good thing I'm not an "Average gamer" than. I have put only $10 towards TF2
MirrorImage: That's it?
that's it.
it's an engineer hat.
11,01I'm not saying anyone here is an average gamer.
the one that makes you bald.
I know
11,01consumer.
Dat dancin' pinkeh.
Buytoast: I play as Engineer alot! I'll take it :P
fine
11,01I heavily vote with my wallet for example.
11,01Been doing so for years.
I just wanted to point out I wasn't average.
MirrorImage: Wow.:O That's pretty stupid.
Time to man some machines... to HELL!!
Buytoast: What would happen if you use that hat...on the heavy?
to the "srs" gamer, yes
to valve, it was absoultely brilliant
11,01The avg. gaming consumer is way too open with theirs.
Probably nothing
I learned today that spy is awesome in this mode
Valve knows their hat Simulator 2012 audience.
Well there goes my conspiracy theory....
Upgrade your sapper above all else
Spy is sappin mah machines?
magmablock - nah, here's what you do
Big Earner + Dead Ringer
11,01Most publisher know their audience...as cash cows with loose teets.
first wave, dump 2 points in +25 Health on Kill for the knife
THEN start dumping into sapper
0,14heh
0,14Teets
Dem teets
so now your knife, on a backstab, restores +30 Cloak and +50 Health
But that's all people are to others these days.
and you have a dead ringer for when you're discovered
Dollar signs.
11,01That's fine except when that thinking leads to highly-unethical business practices.
Nittany_Discord IKR? My friend has put over $200 into TF2 because he "doesn't have anything else to do with it except Yu Gi Oh cards". I always ask him why he isn't saving up for a car.
which I am
Sapper can be maxed out by the end of the second wave if you're good at collecting cash, but to each his own, I guess
yu gi oh is still around?
holy shit
despite having a couple years to go
magmablock - perhaps, but the health on knife allows you to be a little more reckless
Why save for a car when you can buy hats?
Buytoast it is, and it's popular here. We have a Great White and they host tournaments every Saturday
Buytoast: IKR? Did you hear about Yu0Gi-Oh 5DS?
i ahven't seen a yu-gi-oh card since the thousand eyes relinqush thing was
MirrorImage: Is that the perks of the Big Earner?
and you can have the sapper upgraded "enough" by the end of the third
cachi01|mobile: HATS!
11,01Especially when you get a company run by an MBA, who puts logical profit-seeking above the human element.
How do you make the pyro secondary gun, the one that makes continuous burn damage?
XAX - by default it's +30 Cloak on Kill
MirrorImage: Ah.
cachi01|mobile because I look for things with practicallity in the real world
add +50 Health on Kill for mvm and it's nuts with the Dead Ringer
Canadian_Brony like hats?

I love using the golf club on MvM
SuperBrony64 It probably won't even be out yet where I am.
except online
Oh wow lol
O_O
but Cartridges won't be lost if you lose the SD card or it gets wiped
OUCH
IMO, the game card is preferable
THe phlog looks top tier on MvM
11,02Canadian_Brony: Yeah...but the box ><
11,02I guess if I could buy the box later >>
/me noms SuperBrony64
/me is nommed D:
:3
everyday I'm bufferin
13bleh
That's an effective strategy. Pyro and medic to collect the cash while others watch over the other entrances.
SuperBrony64 if you get it in-store, you will get the awesome box, you won't lose a $50 game if you lose your SD card, you'll have MUCH more space on it, and you can easily transfer between systems.
Should think about that next time when I get my ass handed to me on the same round repeatedly.
13
13bad time for comcast fail
Shizuka did it?
I didn't notice
11,02Canadian_Brony: You can always redownload the game from the eShop and easily transfer the data between two 3DS.
smooth sailin' on my end
11,02Plus I get 100 coins on Club Nintendo ><
SuperBrony64 in that case, I don't know. You do whatever you think is best. I couldn't buy the game ATM even if I wanted to.
My laptop is glitched. On Defragmentor it says I have like 100Mb fre space, however I have 0% free space. I need 15% free space for it to work properly.
MASF123 duh fuq
Yeah...I'll screencap if you want.
I'm trying to figure out what the colourful spikes on the stream mean
internet?
my brain is running on half a cylander ATM

The tf2 noises are whats keeping me awake
I'm in desperate need of caffeine and sugar.

13hope ponies were not too bored
Not really. Thanks for the stream :P
Naw, Shizu. Watching you burn robots to death is always fun.
Thanks for streaming. ^_^
13i figured tf2 would be more exciting than watching me photoshop and tweak code
TF2 is usually always fun
:P
13ponies probably get enough of photoshop from our art streamers
13do not need my amateur web graphics boring them
Pfft, nothing wrong with seeing some more art.
13http://i.imgur.com/U93xw.png
13that is the kind of thing you would be seeing
Kewl
hmm?
Art is something to appreciate it every once a while. Don't worry about it
What the hell?
Reminds me of Money Ball
Science made fun?
Monkey Ball
And a little bit og Marble Blast
of
Ok so.....
SB streaming?
yes
11,02Yesh ^-^
Heh nice
No wonder. Go, SB!
Dat lag lol
lol
Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, and Day of Defeat were all mods players made and Valve bought?
yes
Wow Valve is lazy
Yes, originally mods.
No that's a good plan.
?
well not Team Fortress classic i think
See, that's working with the community.
^
I also heard that L4D was not originally not developed by Valve.
Instead of iron handing like EA and Activision.
They bought it and remade it
MASF123, it was a Counter Strike mod at first.
Valve liked th idea.
MASF123: i think it was a classic console game
You do their job and try to say they're lazy after.
Gotta go fast.
I would lol
First I would need a degree
Lol
Most games valve has published was originally mods, So anything that wasn't half-life was community made and they actually hired the mod makers
Lolol
Hurry for mods!
Those that made counter strike was hired, The portal 1 makers etc etc
Lol
It's funny though, isn't it? They only made Half Life and it's taking them forever to get it done.
Just give in.
But the creators of Portal weren't mods they were working on Narbicular Drop before Valave bought it and it became Portal.
Dis music.
Awwww yeah.
So he is a quicksilver blob?
I find out that there is actually Half-Life 3 concept art hidden in the Half-Life 2: Episode 2 files folder.
suuuure
Saw a video about ti
Ok whatever
Now you're just being too obvious Lol'd
MASF123: Valve has also released a very concept art images, But they are what? 2 or 3 in total
a very few*
can't sleep. so who's streaming

Is the background 3D? I'm not so sure.
probably
What in the world? lol
I loke trains
This is making me want to play Minecaft a bit.
lolz what
:D
Actually more Terraria.
Might be the first time a platformer gave me a headache...oh no wait, I'm wrong.
TERRAORE
FG
What is this?
SM64, SMW, EWJ, Sonic...all gave me headaches wtf.
It's Fez.
Dispenser. :3
OH
lol Zelda music
in a different tune
Question.
Dis music... so peaceful.
What do they call it Half-Life?
flam
huh?
MASF123: Half life has something to do with science, something about nuclear decay
okay
MASF123, something about the life of an atom and nuclear decay.
ok makes sense
MASF123: Can't remember exactly, but along the lines of half way through decay
And Gordon's a physists so it makes sense.
He's a scientist too
yeah, your point?
shut up
A quantum physists.
Lol.
Just a scientist in the office... Yet he learns how to use over 10 military firearms...
In a single day after an outbreak.
What's this game? :3
AdamTheDuck, it's the suit.
The raven on my fore-head thirsts for his blood!
Fez
Spell-of-Gaming, Fez, hai btw.
Ooh, Fez.
Ninjazz: Really? It's all the suit, didn't know that.
DAMN RIGHT NIGGA MM MM
Heard of it, but haven't played it yet.
The HEV suit wa experiemnted on Gordon first?
AdamTheDuck, well, I was mostly joking. But really Gordan is supposed to really just emulate us. The suit kinda keeps him alive but it's us that make him a killing machine.
I didn't play the first Half-Life, but this is mention in Episode 2
Ninjazz: Oh I know that the suit protects him, it's the fact that after a single day in the office he learns how to use several different firearms correctly.
What does HEV stand for?
Hazardous Environmental V-something
I know BFG in Doom stands for Big Fucking Gun
Ninjazz: True... True...
13Hazardous EnVironment Suit
13HEV Suit
oh
Well that V makes sense
I was thinking more along the lines of Vest but I'm not too sure
11,02This music makes me feel like I'm playing Myst...
This music makes my desk feel so comfy~
11,02Do you all want me to keep playing this game? o.o
What's up with the crowbar?
Sure, SB.
Up to you SuperBrony64 :3
Up to you
Um...IDK SuperBrony64
MASF123, that was just the first weapon that he happen to find.
Ninjazz: Well remember gordon lives in or did live in a facility with guards and all that along with shooting ranges so no surprise he knows how to handle a ton of weapons
11,02I'll try another new game for now :)
Try 'Splosionman
The demo
And he's not gonna
SuperBrony64, Get Dust :3
11,02Moo o.o
killerpony7733, well, huh. Yeah, the ranges could have been practice for the expidition crews. But the guards are there to protect the facility and keep nosy people out of places.
MMMOOOOO!!!!
Well back to Half-Life Beta searching
Oh this game
what's this?
Spelunky I believe
I liked this game better when it was free
Ninjazz: Yep but black mesa in general had armories a ton of places spread out and gordon being able to access them and have some form of weapons training was required of him, Cause remember how some of the crews sen't out had weapons and those ammo canisters?
Oh and the black mesa training program,
killerpony7733, of course!
So theres alot of sense in how gordon knows how to handle firearms in general and all,
Bet he never thought he'd use them against all them aliens, US Marines and Combine, though.
Wow my first time looking at Half-Life gameplay the game has really come far.
Well I'll be heading to bed now. Just remember everyone that this contest is still up. Guess the bid and win a free steam game. http://pastebin.com/MXnQ1Yt9
It looks fun even though it is old.
Tomorrow that contest is over.
Gnight, CrimsonPhoenix. Sleep well.

killerpony7733, the characters are anthropomorphic

killerpony7733: fluffy talking things?
CrimsonPhoenix: Very much the thought in my head,

and I see he has air jump in there
I don't have that right now D:
Quick time event for chest
legit
Vordox, I'm getting some very bad vibes from you now
CrimsonPhoenix: Jealousy =P
I just got this game and I'm loving it right now
no
I just don't want you to ruin my hype with details
No CrimsonPhoenix .
<--- Wish to be a game designer
<-- Stream, a "mostly" one man person made this whole game.
is that available for pc?
Jealousy
Dark_Horst, I don't know
I don't think so
when I heard of this game first it said it was XBLA exclusive
Also CrimsonPhoenix . If ONE person destroys a game for you, that must mean you didn't lke the game to begin with =P
pretty
Vordox, just shut, I LOVE this game
Great, then that's your opinion, don't sway it
"Whatddya buying"

SuperBrony64: <.<
11,02Vordox: Moo ^-^
why cant i get rid of the feeling that i saw that fluff-bat thing before?
11,02I wonder if VanillaWare made this game o.o
SuperBrony64: Thought you got bored again =P
No
it was made by...
SuperBrony64, no it's one guy
Humble Hearts
Publisher(s)	Microsoft Studios
Designer(s)	Dean Dodrill
That guy

i hope there's a pc emulator for this ting somewhere, i'd really lke to play it
00,02i cant see whats going on through the encoding artifacts, but whatever it is i'm betting it's really cool
It's a game of culmination =P
Phase4: a cat, a sword and a fluffy bat-thing run around and fuck shit up
I GET IT

So far I've seen only one new thing in this game
but i like silly
11,02Me too o.o
And that's the split Spin
00,02ohai bambi
And I'm not sure I've seen it before or not =P
00,02u in dis game too?
Phase4: Visuals =P
I got to admit, it's a damn pretty game.
11,02ikr :D
I wonder how he made it
Some parts looks like Vectors.
Meaning it's either digitially done in code, or premade into Flash
The backgrounds are easily made in code from a proper BG point network.
00,02it did look good
Impressive =P
ok and I'm back.
00,02doing vectors in real time is needlessly complex, but not imposible
Anyone play the first Half-Life?
00,02years ago, it confused me
Phase4: It's not THAT hard..is it?
00,02not really, i just didnt get the point of it
00,02i shoot a guy, walk foward, now what?
inb4 they killed Kenny!
Phase4: People like to make bit, not byte, Phase4 :P
Vectors? I don't even know how to start with the begininng of Flash
momor and papr

Vordox, nope. These guys were the first to head west.
Ninjazz: Pilgrims?
Amish are just people who don't like electricity.
If you cross your skis when going downhill, your gonna have a bad time.
Vordox, no. Those guys came from Amsterdam in the 1600's.

Ninjazz: I'm afraid we won't be able to play today, since it will take like 7 hours to download the game (yay for the lightning speed internet).
I'll just add you to friends for now.

AdamTheDuck: Phase4 said his settings broked, and he had to restart the stream
i forgot about the rule again
Anaruski: fool. ALL OF THE SYMETRY
00,02its funny hearing you guys complain about buffer
slap harder, im not bleeding enought ._.
Phase4:
00,02because i'm using an external player
Phase4: try limev
00,02and the video is flawless
Phase4, the life of a streamer.
00,02the player, and therefore adobe's code, is faulty
Phase4: badassoverhere
At last, it's running without buffer :)
Annnnnnnnnd it buffers
:[
DAMN IT
Phase4: How watch stream with VLC? is possible?
This buffer is rather frustrating
Phase4: use livestream.com
tara strong has a cute voice
00,02XAX, rtmp://mips.tv/live/bsmipsbackup

Phase4: Awesome.
00,02i've had trouble getting it to work in vlc, i'm using mplayer

00,02and i cant stream to livestream because they hate me
Twilight <3
尾k
ふｃｋ。。。
Phase4: :< Why?

Spike: Y U NO MENTION RARITY?
she has such a cute plot...
Anaruski: y
everyday i am buffering
I got a hold of my brother's Wii :3
Nice :o
00,02XAX, you have to use their software
Bronysith: y
Phase4: oshit
XAX: wat?
00,02you try getting anything that isnt a webcam into their software
00,02its painfull
Bronysith: iunno
at last the buffer lets up!
And Jesus, it hasn't been updated for years.
www.iaccidentalyputonjapaneseanddontknowhowtogetoutofhiraganamodeexceptwww.trigger
this part reminde me of the TV show 24
Phase4: its not that hard
Anaruski: ...lol
00,02JRP, on linux
Phase4: well in windows its super easy to use
00,02no it isnt
00,02not for what i want to do
Phase4: its the most easiest softwere i have
Season 1 Rarity can find gems in ground with magic - season 2 Rarity cant find gems in ribbon - therefore ribbon is dark matter
what u do is screen cap the webcam softwere
I imagine that Nintendo likes to troll us with the DSi
You needed an Expansion Card to use Nintendo DS Browser, but in DSi? NOPE.AVI
metroid prime is coming to 3ds
Twilight therapist

But it's pretty slow.

Phase4: the only way they could top it is with tony jay
BUT HE DED
Could just be discord*
Phase4: indeed
Bronysith: I cry evertim
im what you call the bad type of brony hehehe
a lot of googling later, i think its a "divan"
Twilight the rapist
G4 Twilight is best twilight
<3 Smartie Pants
The season 3's villain should come from a plot twist in the episode.

dat rapeface...
tony jay has best villain voice

Maid_RainBow: Mig mac dose whatever/?
