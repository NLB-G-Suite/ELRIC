08,01panda: it's not random! there was a perfectly well-defined thoguht process behind it, that mainly involved me smelling my hair

Saturn: WANT!

You fuckin' retarded?
That was too easy
THERE MUST BE COMPETITION/LIFE
11,01Uh oh.
/me throws 17 Twinkies out there
I'll take that as a yes. :I
Wait, AE do they have Twinkies in England?
11,01Cheetah!
lol
13yeah but they're difficult to find
Hmm....
13they're expensive here, basically xD
/me runs
Alright. I got to go. Could someone please ping me when they get to the end credits? I need 15 minutes warning to make popcorn.
I had a spider craw out of my hair once.
*huddled ontop of desk* ;A;
Twinkies are popular and somewhat cheap in the US
11,01Did EqD lift the no OC rule for Drawfriends?
Because they're American, of course
spiders are good
11,01Or was that for Fanfics?
damn son
Don't know about OC's
Never forget that you are more afraid of spiders than they are of you.
1,11Hello downhill spiral.
13which is apparently rounded up to $3
And spiders can breathe underwater.
13according to the converter on my phone
11,01There's Raipony in today's drawfriend.
dooooooomed
Speaking of arachnids I saw one of ungodly size a few weeks ago
Wow
Hes even more doomed if he meets Spiderman
That's nuts
/me is not in the mood for noms
but I can get them here in Naples for that much thanks to the Comissary :3
I 'm fine with spiders
well... if there werent spiders could you imagine how many bugs there would be in the world?
Spiders are scarey as fuck yet interesting at the same time unlike scorpians
00,03Maybe you should teach the spider to DANCE
I HATE scorpions
Scorpians are just hurtful ;A;
moneyz
I don't mind mice but spiders need to DIE
/me 11,01spiders about.
It's amazifying
Dat twirl
I would like to have a tarantula
Thus, the reason i'm terrified of spiders
wait
twinkies are HOW expensive there?
$9001
/me runs
is it maid hour?!?
ok see
IT'S OVER 9 I mean, I think just $1.50
Euro maid hour
that's ridiculous LOL
11,01twilight_sprinkler: I don't always have to kill things.
wooohoo
It's 9 PM somewhere
I don't buy them often, but I think that's last check
OK ENOUGH SPIDER TALK, HOW ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT ICE CREAM

Spider cream

Smartie flavor! :D

I once had a dream that a spider came out of a cream pastry I was eating.

/me 11,01serves ice cream.
Okay, seriously, what's this "spiderses" meme?
uh
/me eats ice cream

No wait, I had a dream that it was actually spider meat in it.
08,01what are we watching
Isn't it like the-
NO MORE SPIDER TALK ;~;
yeah.
11,01OK.
:'D
^
I don't buy twinkies often, but they're dirt cheap lol
*shoved a bag over my head*
Spider, spider, spider, spider, spider, spider, spider. Spider.
Let's talk about ants
Fuck you.
08,01hahahahaa
Antman
NO ANTS. NO FUCKING SPIDERS. PERIOD.
Its all empty words
08,01SparklyWaffles: moths?
very wise words
Needs to be about 20% ruder
NO INSECTS
HEYEYAYEYEAY
08,01SparklyWaffles: but moths are ADORABLE
11,01Urge to dust...rising.
NO, BUTTERFLY'S ARE.
Technically spiders aren't insects.
Luna Moths?
neither are scorpians
Insects = 2 legs, Spiders = 8 legs
Kookaburra sits in the old gum treeeee.
Both spiders and scorpians are Arachnids
*shutters*
/me 08,01loves all Saturniids
OOps I mean insects = 6 legs *Facehoof*
Whoa
/me loves her pet snake
I must be highly overestimating
6well
6>imports
08,01centipedes are awesome
6importing anything makes it more expensive
I want to get one of those snakes that can bite even when decapitated.
Actually the Comissary isn't affected by import prices
w...tf...
08,01MahBoi777: aye; were you here yesterday when i was talking about Saturniidae?
1,11He looks a lot like Scarface in this scene.
08,01panda: i *love* bugs
Twinkies definitely aren't as great as they once were.
:3
:D
FFFF-
Saturn: hehe they "bug" me out XD
We get the best of both worlds: Cheap, local Italian products and cheap, American products from home
Saturn: I wasn't lol
AGDHALDFAJHAKDSGFADS
NO
08,01i breed moths and othe rinsects
08,01mainly Saturniidae (silkmoths)
Saturn sells moths and moth accessories.

08,01Darf14: "Veni."
Piss off
Saturn: lol I get it! lol

My motto is "It's never as bad as it looks as long as you don't look at it."
Veni huh
My motto is "When in doubt, think of ponies"
My motto is .....wait I have no motto... *starts thinking about it*
08,01Biglaw: lie back and think of ponies
11,01*shrug*
6I'm not much for hostess

Saturn already on it
6first of all, ALL of the names are awkward as heck
My motto is 'When worried, imagine the crowd as ponies.'
Bite down on this, IT helps
6second, they're just a bit much for me
11,01My motto is *explodes*
6but if anything, I'll take HoHos any day

03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiBF4umzCgs
03I'm not even in the band there LOL
03but it kinda pisses me off when people are all "marching bands are stupid"
03because it's actually a lot of effort
03and somehow they think booing the other team is acceptable >_>
02ah
03when I go to the football games people give me weird looks for not being hateful of the other team
Isn't verizon getting rid of Unlimited plans for good?
:<
03plus I don't even care about the football teams
02marching band is awesome
03but booing the other team's *marching band* is just incredibly childish
02EW American football
6well
03^
6in tht sense, football players from either team are talented too
03well
6but I get wehat you're saying
03yeah
03and the student section actually organizes those "BOO YOU SUCK" chants
6and then there's CSUF, where we don't have a football team
03heck, everybody here hates Ohio State (university)
03I'm like
6haven't had one in decades
03OSU is a perfectly good school
03just because you're rivals with their football team
03is no reason to say the school sucks
03it's a perfectly good schoo
03>_>
03*l
03yeah, sports rivalries piss me off
6I always enjoyed rivalries, due to me being competitive by nature
6but I never outright hated a school
6it's a school.
03well
6the people are people
6yeah
03that's just not cool >_>
03I mean
6that's just stupid
03equate to terrorizing a school
04It doesn't
6CSUF and CSULB are rivals, but we never go and terrorize people lol
03it's really dumb
03exactly
03hence when I get people commenting "this band sucks"
6well
6they're entitled to opinions
03Most marching bands are legit, whether their show is good or not XD
I'd say that I think MOST people are pulled along as a sort of "friendly trash talk" but it honestly doesn't even seem that way lol.
03well
<%drfsupercenter> any band? can play that song, its a bunch of notes
it hurts to live
03exactly
03hence why I replied
03"I'd like to see you try to play this, then"
03:P
inb4 "lol sry i'm not a nerd XD"
6in the person's defense
6and /band/
6and read music

03well
03he was replying to another comment asking why people were booing
6I still think he's a moron

03yeah
03I usually just delete comments like that
03but eh
6really it just looks like a regular comment to me

chanserv seems to be missing
03since I was totally trying to talk to him when his connection died
http://blastmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/wii-u-controller-new.jpg < Also, no more circle pads! :D
2yeah
did the channel get unregistered again?
2tried to get it back, but it's offline
oh
2..square buttons and docking holes?
02wait
02right when I get used to circle pads
03I hate the 3DS circle pad
03I really don't like the 3DS at all
6wait
03DSi XL or gtfo
6why are they getting rid of circle pads
6wait
6no
6there's circle pads on there
6two of them
03it's not that they're "getting rid of them"
03well
03those are actual joysticks
6they're awkwardly placed o_O
03if they tried to do that on the 3DS
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=456C4NH4d4U
03it wouldn't work
03due to closing lid
03wtf @ that name
13I dunno why I'm listening to this, I don't even like it
13;w; it's weird
02Circle pads are more durable and have higher accuracy
02Joysticks are more comfortable to most people though
03circle pads have horrible accuracy
03why do you think the 3DS actually has a mode to calibrate them
03*should
02I don't, but I still like things to be more durable
6horrible accuracy, but /higher/ accuracy than say a d-pad
6I think was the point
03yeah but he's comparing it to joysticks?
6I dunno
6joysticks are pretty nice :/
02which they did say for a fact
03^
03like the Sidewinder kind
02I like both myself
03is purely epic
6question
04Playing Halo with a joystick is fun.
6is there a joystick for the PS3
/me RUNS
6the reason I ask is because the people behind Skullgirls have custom sticks for sale (or prizes at tournies)
6...
6joystick, not circle pad
/me headdesks
6or however you want to call it
6god
6see
6you are mind cancer
6I can't even think straight
03oh, you mean like that arcade thing>?
6drf yeah
03haven't looked for PS3
03though
6sorry, i call all contoller joysticks circle pads
04there, there
6only full scale sticks are joysticks imo
04You learn to drown it out
02oh
03that might work
03not sure though
6hmm
03though I'm not sure, I haven't tried it
03hm
03I could try it on the PS3 I have here but I don't have any regular joysticks
02see, circle pads are what's on the 3DS XD
03just Logitech controllers that look like PS2
6like I said
6I consider them all circle pads
6I don't know why
02ah
6HA
6here's one
6http://forums.redflagdeals.com/sold-ps3-ultimate-fighting-package-custom-joystick-2-games-spare-parts-1094307/
6drf
6those customs are going around with several games
02that remembers me
02Evo 2012
02yes please
03ah
so..how are yous?
03Mad Catz
03yeah problem with regular joysticks is they don't have the buttons that PS3 needs
6how does that work with PS3 games, since they seem to be paired up with some of them
6MvC3 is an example
2I'm good :3
2and you?
03I think those games alow that sort of controller
03*allow
6so I probably wont buy one
6ah
6ok
6that makes sense
03they have similar ones for Xbox
03arcade-style games allow arcade-style controllers
03or well
02\;~;/
03they basically match up the buttons
03they make them equal the regular ones
doing alright
a little stressed though
6yeah I know how that works
6so that makes sense
02<Aurora> MvC3 is an example <- Oh yeah, they use a different bottom mapping
6I just...clearly can't put 2 and 2 together today
02like using some bottoms for L1, R1, etc etc etc
02But a thing that've seen from torneys of fighting games
02is that there isn't many people
2you come?
02with the same controls
2how*
2-you

03why did you use the Japanese audio for the credits?
03did it not match up with the English?
2That reminds me, I still need to work on my resume XD
Well that was odd
02XD
03well
heh
yeah
02English*
03at the beginning
I really think I'm just overreacting
03so he used a text to speech thingy to just read it
03except the theme song is Japanese
03o.o
03it's only the intro song
6hmm
03granted, Mezase Pokémon Master is an awesome song, but still
2yeah
2I do that often

and it felt weird
6LOL
Good old times
13pins and needles?
6that's fun xD
6angel yeh
13I tend to get that when I sit cross-legged on my chair for too long
13which I'm doing right now
6walking is awesome XD
I would say something bit it is a bit TMI
6lolwhat
13I remember when I once woke up and my entire left arm was numb and it didn't feel like it was my arm when I touched it
13then after about 10 seconds the circulation came back and that pins and needles feeling rushed through my arm
13THAT felt strangely awesome
13.w.
6walk around for a bit
6it's hilarious
It irritates me
13I've made my leg go kinda numb before
13felt like I was wearing a boot
13but I wasn't
6 /completely/ numb
Including when you're 1,1 sitting on the toilet for a long time using a laptop/3DS and forget about it and try to get up
6LOL
13LOL
13k if my leg ever goes completely numb, I'll remember to get up and try to walk around on it
13xD
6if you went as far to mention that, I might as well admit I've done that once or twice

I'd say pretty much all the songs are epic... just good in their own ways
Isn't this the longest song in the series?
Winter Wrap Up is my 2nd.:)

Best thing about this song is that it's crucial to setting up the conflict for the episode.

Maybe I should just stand there while she's trying to watch a show, since she'll pause it.
That way she'll never finish it.

If you die Saturn, can you tell me about it?
Saturn: you bet, we'll even throw in an extra 5 seconds just for you!
Saturn: You cant die from stress
Saturn: don't say that!
11,02Saturn: Not just 1 min...we'll do 1 minute 30 seconds of it :D

04Expy, as in a specific quirk or trait of a character becomes its defining attribute
04Though
11,02Hai :D
Bronies4evar.....yeah no i didnt
03I went and killed like 5 pigs
good job
13fluttershy wouldn't have a show, or else it would be on Discovery Channel during the "shows about people with psych issues" blocks
08,01i'd watch it.
03but I don't really want to put it on a harder difficulty
03LOL
11,02Moo ^-^
Saturn: Get some people on this, NOW!
epic voice
Saturn: mtv?
13i thought expy was a character that feels like it was taken from another show
No moos!
11,02It cool :3
the derpy show?
11,02brb ^-^
08,01i'd watch The Appljack Show
08,01actually, i think RD and PP would make the best co-hosts
you'll be set
did you know the reddit alien has a name
13http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/seth2n_5924.png basically that
its snoo
Time is... 12:57 am. 7 hours and 7 minutes 2 go.

04Frick
04That CMC ep
04Oh...what was it called...

04PONYVILLE CONFIDENTIAL, THAT'S IT
08,01ah yeah
Huh, coulda sworn
chachi01: but but i live there

but yeah, just set it to normal
hard wont make any difference
04He's one of the best characters on the show :o
whats Flanderized

Wait...what are we talking about? O.o
03OK
*in spawn rate
03well first I need to set up some chests
03:D
04Flanderized, when a specific quirk or trait of a character becomes that character's defining attribute
nah
Aaaah.

04It would be the only thing he does or say
oh ok
/me 08,01needs validation
whatever though
hmm
when you start dealing with enemies
you really dont want to go out between forts in the middle of the night
04Basically the characters stop seeming like real people and become more...character-y
Saturn: Star Trek?
thats why people try to connect everything
underground passages might work
08,01WallDives: well, yes
03hm
03I could try that
*vocabulary
08,01but do you know which ones?
03I mean
Not to be "that guy" but is something going on with the stream?
family guys overrated
03don't wanna screw it up
Saturn: no, I never could actually watch any of the series.
04True
then it hit season 9
hmm... no stream... that makes my choice easier, back to lurking...
04But I'll tell you one thing I liked

I used to like Brian.
04I can honestly say that I disliked Stewie originally
03How else do I build below it?
03it's all sand under there
Stewie eez not evil no moar
