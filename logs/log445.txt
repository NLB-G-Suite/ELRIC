RainbowAsh: this movie is more of a setup for the Avengers movie
gentlemen. i must go. my work station needs me...

Well, I can't take those kinds of attacks lying down. It doesn't matter if you're trying to get my goat. If I'm silent to that, I agree and comply. But I also have to avoid raging too. I have to respond reasonably and compassionate to blind hatred and I honestly don't know how to do that.

GilDash: Brohoof /)

Kandarihu: (\

Lil_B hilbilly? sounds like a name xD

*takes FlareChaser's rejected dire wolf cub*
Nittany_Discord: PONIES! :D
08,01panda: it's not random! there was a perfectly well-defined thoguht process behind it, that mainly involved me smelling my hair
Nittany_Discord can they explode twice?

Gunthler: wait what?
1,11Hello, random cemetary...
I use T-Gel for dandruff
11,01Oh.
panda: Dunno.
/me dances because HectorLaScoot said amigos
owo
So, what's the point of this film? Nothing interesting happens?
08,01GabeMoist: better smelling shampoo washes off the coal tar
exactly
/me becomes an alies in spirit of Prometheus and crawls inside panda
00,03>singing and dancing
*Alien
00,03>Not interesting

GilDash: not what you think

/me dances and sings on HectorLaScoot s head
08,01GabeMoist: that's not a bad idea, actually
SparklyWaffles: ur name fills me with utter joy lol
/me smells GilDash's mane
Bjornfot: I can see that. Still, it's gone crazy and I'm missing it. :D

..or I can play WoW...
Nice
08,01it's amazing
lolyeah
this movie feels like a documentary..... that's not a good thing
GilDash: surprisingly?
and maybe do some raids...
11,01Does it taste like cookies?
OR I can kill everyone in TF2.
pony_300: well... it does, but....
that works.
This isn't salsa...
suddenly santa smoking?
WallDives: What? I can't have sarcasm in my text? :D
o-o
mexica santa
MahBoi777: yeah you are about 45 minutes late
oh well
08,01Cobellanez: thank you <3
GilDash: sarcasm countered with sarcasm.
Nittany_Discord: It never tastes like how it smells. It always tastes fucking foul. I still haven't learnt. :D
:0
WAH HO HO HO HO
:)
08,01unfortunately, because i've bleached the shit out of it, it isn't in very good condition
Let there be life.
Quote of the day right there
11,01Oh GilDash *dusts*
WallDives: You're gonna start a war~! :D
08,01panda: i have long, curly pink hair
CURLY PINK?
nope! I use my sarcasm wisely.
Nittany_Discord: :)
OH GOD
/me glomps panda
Serious?
08,01i'm also random and bounce off the walls
WallDives: I'm British, as you well know. I can't *not* use it. :D I have a quota after all! :D
NO NO THERE'S A HUGE SPIDER ON MY CEILINGASDFGHKLJJLKHDF
11,01Salsa!
panda: hello btw lol
/me glomps Gunthler back ," hehe"
08,01though i'm not random to myself, obviously
/me 11,01throws salsa into the channel.
SparklyWaffles: The answer is clearly see if you can hit it with a spitball.
it burrrrrrrrrrrns
/me hugs MahBoi777 "hello to you to :)"
/me throws a Twinkie into SW
dem plots
Back, btw.
How much time's left in the movie?
/me mops up Nittany_Discord's salsa
08,01GabeMoist: maaaaybe >.>
/me eats salsa
GilDash: never said anything about restricting it. I'm just going to poke fun at it, as I am to do.
/me hugs panda back
Which salsa Nittany_Discord ?
00,03Looks like my Friday nights~
DAT COKE
11,01Hot salsa.
What's going on in the movie so far? I got distracted like half an hour ago.
WallDives: Feel free to do so. :)
00,03but instead of coke, its ponies
Again, WHICH salsa Nittany_Discord ?
/me moos all over SuperBrony64
11,01HectorLaScoot is a coke addict?
11,01Nvm.
Meanwhile: sex, drugs and salsa
going to anyway.
00,03:D
11,01Pace.
/me SNATCHES THE TWINKIE
Nice combo.
Music and food can be hot.
FOOD
/me puts ghost peppers in salsa and eats more
/me Gets out his Doritoes
owo
Meanwhile: yes but they forgot the chips at home ^^
huh, I sure came in at a awkward scene
11,01Not that stuff from New York City.
panda: :s
You fuckin' retarded?
Gunthler: hehe whats wrong?
That was too easy
Meanwhile: :( it was a joke
THERE MUST BE COMPETITION/LIFE
Meanwhile: Ponies! :D
11,01Uh oh.
/me throws 17 Twinkies out there
I'll take that as a yes. :I
I threw a shoe at the spider and it fell on the floor now it's on the floor and i don't know where it is and i'm scared ;~;
For some blueberry fuck reason my Morphball and Highjump abilities were offline
Wait, AE do they have Twinkies in England?
11,01Cheetah!
Aww SparklyWaffles.
lol
SparklyWaffles: :D
SparklyWaffles: stay where you are! lol
SparklyWaffles: Just remember, it's more afraid of you then you are it.
13yeah but they're difficult to find
panda: Dat pony rp :d
GilDash: That's actually not true.
Hmm....
13I only recently found out there's a shop here that sells imported stuff from the US
13they're expensive here, basically xD
/me runs
Gunthler: haha you are never gonna let that go huh?
Meanwhile: I know. I like spiders anyway.
Scare it away with SparklyWaffles, SparklyWaffles .
:s
Alright. I got to go. Could someone please ping me when they get to the end credits? I need 15 minutes warning to make popcorn.
SparklyWaffles: I know how you feel. Last autumn, five cellar spiders congregated to my screen door's front.
panda: nope. :d
Most spiders lack the cognitive process to fear human beings more than they fear sudden movements in the ground.
I had a spider craw out of my hair once.
*huddled ontop of desk* ;A;
Twinkies are popular and somewhat cheap in the US
Gunthler: hehe
11,01Did EqD lift the no OC rule for Drawfriends?
/me erases Gunthler 's memory with a LED flash pen :D
spiders are good
11,01Or was that for Fanfics?
Human beings on the other hand can be afraid of spiders to a very deeply psychological level.
13it's £1.50 just for one twinkie here xD
Om: Was it a hitchhiking spider?
SPIDERS ARE A BIG NOPE
I think Fanfics had the no Brony in Equestria rule didn't it?
damn son
GilDash: Just a tiny thing.
Don't know about OC's
Never forget that you are more afraid of spiders than they are of you.
Meanwhile: yeah, thats when it becomes more than a phobia, and becomes some what of a disorder
1,11Hello downhill spiral.
/me noms Om
lol Meanwhile
13which is apparently rounded up to $3
Nittany_Discord: I've seen FanFics with OCs regularly. Drawfriends tend to be stricter, but I've seen afair few pour though too, so who knows?
And spiders can breathe underwater.
11,01Though I think I've seen Palette Swap art in a Drawfrend before.
So you're basically doomed.
Well, FO:E gets a lot of coverage, and that stars an OC.
13according to the converter on my phone
11,01There's Raipony in today's drawfriend.
Spiders will follow you to the goddamn moon in search of revenge.
FFF- THE BITCH CRAWLED INSIDE MY SHOE *cries*
dooooooomed
Speaking of arachnids I saw one of ungodly size a few weeks ago
Wow
Hes even more doomed if he meets Spiderman
That's nuts
/me is not in the mood for noms
/me hugs SparklyWaffles "it'll be ok"
Meanwhile: Meh, spiders tend to trap/kill pesky flies. That's fine by me.
13Imported stuff is always expensive, so yeah xD
I think it's just $1.50 or so in the States
Floated on water as well O_O"
/me double-noms Om.
but I can get them here in Naples for that much thanks to the Comissary :3
I 'm fine with spiders
DeathStar :3
Spiders know where you are, they know where you live. They know where you sleep. And they are watching. They are waiting. And when the time is right, they will take you.
well... if there werent spiders could you imagine how many bugs there would be in the world?
Spiders are scarey as fuck yet interesting at the same time unlike scorpians
00,03Maybe you should teach the spider to DANCE
Meanwhile: XD
I HATE scorpions
/me teached the spider how to dance
Scorpians are just hurtful ;A;
moneyz
freaky lookin things
I don't mind mice but spiders need to DIE
/me 11,01spiders about.
/me dances with spider on HectorLaScoot s head
It's amazifying
Especially if their shell color matches your shoes <.< >.>
Dat DeathStar :L
One time there was a spider in the cookie jar. and i ate a cookie. I threw up afterwards.
Dat twirl
I would like to have a tarantula
Thus, the reason i'm terrified of spiders
thats not what he said
/me gives DeathStar yet *another* dancing Derpy. :D
wait
twinkies are HOW expensive there?
Meanwhile: Okay, now half those spider facts are bullshit. :D
Nittany_Discord: but isnt a maids job to kill spiders?
Gunthler: I have quite a collection of these now
$9001
/me runs
is it maid hour?!?
GilDash: Spiders live in your esophagus.
twilight_sprinkler: No, we just dust the cobwebs. :)
ok see
OmegaMetroidBrony: not yet
Meanwhile: ... Not this again...
IT'S OVER 9 I mean, I think just $1.50
I never think about stuff like this
OmegaMetroidBrony: nit yet
Euro maid hour
that's ridiculous LOL
11,01twilight_sprinkler: I don't always have to kill things.
DeathStar: I know, about 3... 4... maybe even 5...?
wooohoo
It's 9 PM somewhere
I don't buy them often, but I think that's last check
OK ENOUGH SPIDER TALK, HOW ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT ICE CREAM
spiderses
Gunthler: yeh
o_o;;
Spider cream
How much are they for you Aurora?
I LIKE CHOCOLATE
NO
CREAMSPIDER
Smartie flavor! :D
FFF-
CREAMDREAMSPIDER
CREAM of spider egg
DED
Vanilla Icecream with spider sprinkles on top
SparklyWaffles: http://i.imgur.com/EJLjz.jpg
I once had a dream that a spider came out of a cream pastry I was eating.

/me eats ice cream
Meanwhile: gah

/me hands SparklyWaffles a spider (thats fizzydrink with icecream init and 8 straws)
No wait, I had a dream that it was actually spider meat in it.
08,01what are we watching
probably about the same it is for one in your area xD
Nittany_Discord: If you find any big mean spiders, just tell me. I'll save them from you. :D
Isn't it like the-
NO MORE SPIDER TALK ;~;
yeah.
11,01OK.
:'D
^
I don't buy twinkies often, but they're dirt cheap lol
*shoved a bag over my head*
hey HectorLaScoot! Sumerpan.
Holy shit woman shut the fuck up and stop having PMS.
soon the guy is going to be shooting up while he's shooting up
/me gives an appropriate nod towards Nittany_Discord
/me hugs SparklyWaffles.
Spider, spider, spider, spider, spider, spider, spider. Spider.
Let's talk about ants
/me gets out
Fuck you.
08,01hahahahaa
Antman
NO ANTS. NO FUCKING SPIDERS. PERIOD.
/me slaps Bjornfot "not cool"
Its all empty words
08,01SparklyWaffles: moths?
very wise words
Needs to be about 20% ruder
NO INSECTS
Then what about centipides?
HEYEYAYEYEAY
08,01SparklyWaffles: but moths are ADORABLE
DeathStar: PMS bitches are not cool either
11,01Urge to dust...rising.
/me pours a bucket of scorpions onto SparklyWaffles
Well, I'm bored on TF2 now.
NO, BUTTERFLY'S ARE.
Technically spiders aren't insects.
Luna Moths?
Hey FlareChaser|TF2! I made another chapter!
neither are scorpians
Bjornfot: you blead once a month and see how you feel
Biglaw: reading it now

DeathStar: Well at least I shut my mouth when I'm in a bad mood. :3
6importing anything makes it more expensive
I haven't seen a Twinkie in a long time
I want to get one of those snakes that can bite even when decapitated.
Actually the Comissary isn't affected by import prices

Seriously, that woman is getting on my nerves. Her voice is PAINFUL to listen to... the way she is so overdramatic and emotional and blames everyone else, thinking she is perfect and does nothing wrong. SHE screamed at him while he was all chillax.

03I'm not even in the band there LOL
03but it kinda pisses me off when people are all "marching bands are stupid"
03because it's actually a lot of effort
03the reason people are booing is because college kids are really immature, and it was an away game
03and somehow they think booing the other team is acceptable >_>
02ah
So DRF
03when I go to the football games people give me weird looks for not being hateful of the other team
Isn't verizon getting rid of Unlimited plans for good?
:<
03plus I don't even care about the football teams
02marching band is awesome
03but booing the other team's *marching band* is just incredibly childish
03they're still really talented whether they're from your school or not :P
6well
03^
6in tht sense, football players from either team are talented too
03I was like the only guy in marching band who didn't actually care about the game
03well
6but I get wehat you're saying
03yeah
03in high school, they'd yell at you if you started booing the other team
03but in college nobody cares
So backwards
03and the student section actually organizes those "BOO YOU SUCK" chants
6and then there's CSUF, where we don't have a football team
03heck, everybody here hates Ohio State (university)
03I'm like
6haven't had one in decades
03OSU is a perfectly good school
03just because you're rivals with their football team
03is no reason to say the school sucks
03it's a perfectly good schoo
03>_>
03*l
03yeah, sports rivalries piss me off
6I always enjoyed rivalries, due to me being competitive by nature
6but I never outright hated a school
6it's a school.
03well
03it goes far enough to the point that when I was still at U of M, we'd have kids from the rival school show up for the rivalry game and actually start trashing our dorm
6the people are people
03just ripping stuff off thew all
6yeah
03that's just not cool >_>
03I mean
6that's just stupid
03how does being a rival with your football team
03equate to terrorizing a school
04It doesn't
03supposedly when we went down to Ohio State for their game, kids there actually got arrested for starting fights
6CSUF and CSULB are rivals, but we never go and terrorize people lol
03it's really dumb
13whatever happened to friendly rivalries these days :<
03exactly
03hence when I get people commenting "this band sucks"
03I'm like no, shut up
6well
6they're entitled to opinions
03Most marching bands are legit, whether their show is good or not XD
I'd say that I think MOST people are pulled along as a sort of "friendly trash talk" but it honestly doesn't even seem that way lol.
03well
03this is what the guy wrote
03any band? can play that song, its a bunch of notes, put anybody in a uniform with a trumpet and someone that can also read music and there, you got what they did in the video
it hurts to live
03exactly
03hence why I replied
03"I'd like to see you try to play this, then"
03:P
inb4 "lol sry i'm not a nerd XD"
6in the person's defense
6and /band/
6as in someone who actually can play an instrument
6and read music
6*any
03well
03he was replying to another comment asking why people were booing
6I still think he's a moron
6but the point being
03yeah
03I usually just delete comments like that
03but eh
he might have a point but it's lost in the typical youtube lack of sense/typing abilities thing
6really it just looks like a regular comment to me
03SCREW FOOTBALL I CAME TO SEE THE BAND!? <- I like comments like this
6meh
03there wasn't a ? at the end
03somehow when copying comments those show up

http://blastmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/wii-u-controller-new.jpg < Also, no more circle pads! :D
2yeah
did the channel get unregistered again?
2tried to get it back, but it's offline
03that looks like a classic console controller with a screen
oh
but it has a battery and a camera and a mic and
2..square buttons and docking holes?
02wait
02right when I get used to circle pads
02they don't give the wii U remote one :|
03I hate the 3DS circle pad
02I got used to it, then started liking it more
03I really don't like the 3DS at all
6wait
03DSi XL or gtfo
6why are they getting rid of circle pads
6wait
6no
6there's circle pads on there
6two of them
03it's not that they're "getting rid of them"
03well
03that's what I mean
03those are actual joysticks
6they're awkwardly placed o_O
03if they tried to do that on the 3DS

03due to closing lid
03wtf @ that name
13I dunno why I'm listening to this, I don't even like it
13;w; it's weird
02Circle pads are more durable and have higher accuracy
02Joysticks are more comfortable to most people though
03dude what
03circle pads have horrible accuracy
03why do you think the 3DS actually has a mode to calibrate them
03more durable maybe, but just don't treat your stuff like crap and you sould be fine
03*should
02I don't, but I still like things to be more durable
6horrible accuracy, but /higher/ accuracy than say a d-pad
6I think was the point
03yeah but he's comparing it to joysticks?
02I guess that's what Nintendo met by higher accuracy
6I dunno
6joysticks are pretty nice :/
02which they did say for a fact
03^
03I like PC joysticks
03like the Sidewinder kind
02I like both myself
03playing Commander Keen with one of those
03is purely epic
6ok so
6question
04Playing Halo with a joystick is fun.
6is there a joystick for the PS3
/me RUNS
6the reason I ask is because the people behind Skullgirls have custom sticks for sale (or prizes at tournies)
6and I keep thinking that it's probably a crapton easier to play that game with a stick than a controller
02yes, all their dual shock controllers have them o.o
6...
6joystick, not circle pad
/me headdesks
6or however you want to call it
6god
6see
6you are mind cancer
02dual shock controllers don't have a circle pad O_o
6I can't even think straight
03oh, you mean like that arcade thing>?
6drf yeah
03I know I've seen them for older systems like Genesis
03haven't looked for PS3
03though
6sorry, i call all contoller joysticks circle pads
/me pets Aurora
03I *think* PS3 can just use regular USB controllers?
04there, there
6only full scale sticks are joysticks imo
03so if you just get a USB joystick
04You learn to drown it out
02oh
03that might work
03not sure though
6hmm
6that might be what it is
03though I'm not sure, I haven't tried it
03hm
03I could try it on the PS3 I have here but I don't have any regular joysticks
02see, circle pads are what's on the 3DS XD
03just Logitech controllers that look like PS2
6like I said
6if it's small scale and is on a controller
6I consider them all circle pads
6I don't know why
02ah
6but I only know of arcade sizes as true joysticks
6HA
6here's one
6http://forums.redflagdeals.com/sold-ps3-ultimate-fighting-package-custom-joystick-2-games-spare-parts-1094307/
6drf
6those customs are going around with several games
02Oh god
02that remembers me
02Evo 2012
02yes please
03ah
so..how are yous?
03Mad Catz
03yeah problem with regular joysticks is they don't have the buttons that PS3 needs
6how does that work with PS3 games, since they seem to be paired up with some of them
6MvC3 is an example
2I'm good :3
2and you?
6idk I'm just curious, they seem expensive as hell though
03I think those games alow that sort of controller
03*allow
6so I probably wont buy one
03if you look on the box
6ah
6ok
6that makes sense
03they have similar ones for Xbox
03arcade-style games allow arcade-style controllers
03or well
02\;~;/
03they basically match up the buttons
03they make them equal the regular ones
03so the game won't *know* you're using a different controller
doing alright
03it just lacks the L/R all that stuff, so if the game needs those, it won't work
a little stressed though
6yeah I know how that works
6so that makes sense
02<Aurora> MvC3 is an example <- Oh yeah, they use a different bottom mapping
6I just...clearly can't put 2 and 2 together today
02like using some bottoms for L1, R1, etc etc etc
02But a thing that've seen from torneys of fighting games
02is that there isn't many people
2you come?
02with the same controls
2how*
2-you

03why did you use the Japanese audio for the credits?
03did it not match up with the English?
2That reminds me, I still need to work on my resume XD
Well that was odd
02a lot of english dub animes do, which is probably why he did
02XD
03well
heh
03the dub movie has its own opening derp
yeah
6well the dub had i-
02English*
03basically the dub of Pokémon Heroes cuts out a fairly important scene
03at the beginning
I really think I'm just overreacting
03so he used a text to speech thingy to just read it
03which sounds funny as heck but I digress
I tend to do that a lot if I don't know what to expect :P
03the rest is just Japanese video with English audio
03except the theme song is Japanese
03o.o
6the english ending songs are fun :<
03the ending songs are still in English
03it's only the intro song
6hmm
03granted, Mezase Pokémon Master is an awesome song, but still
2yeah
2I do that often
6oh I thought you meant the end credits

6http://ragecomicarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tumblr_lrwpi8sVla1qj3rzfo1_500.jpg
6cuz its
6kinda scary awesome
03I don't get it
lolwut
03is that supposed to be a reference to The Ring?
6no
6have you ever had your foot fall asleep?
03yes
6that tingly feeling
6feels like the crazy static of the TV
6I don't know how to explain, but I totally understand what that says xD
remember
when you had CRTs
and you shut them off and your hand was near it
and it felt weird
6LOL
Good old times
13pins and needles?
6that's fun xD
6angel yeh
13I tend to get that when I sit cross-legged on my chair for too long
13which I'm doing right now
6I love when I make my leg completely go numb
13I don't like it but SITTING LIKE THIS IS SO COMFORTABLE
6I can sit on it just right so that everything from my knee down is numb
6walking is awesome XD
I would say something bit it is a bit TMI
6lolwhat
13I remember when I once woke up and my entire left arm was numb and it didn't feel like it was my arm when I touched it
13then after about 10 seconds the circulation came back and that pins and needles feeling rushed through my arm
13THAT felt strangely awesome
13.w.
6I love numb arms/legs
6if you ever manage to get your leg numb
6walk around for a bit
6it's hilarious
It irritates me
13I've made my leg go kinda numb before
13felt like I was wearing a boot
13but I wasn't
6 /completely/ numb
Including when you're 1,1 sitting on the toilet for a long time using a laptop/3DS and forget about it and try to get up
:c
6LOL
13LOL
13k if my leg ever goes completely numb, I'll remember to get up and try to walk around on it
13xD
10I fall asleep sometimes with an arm hanging over the side of my bed. It stays like that all night and by morning I have to shake my arm around because of the numbness
6if you went as far to mention that, I might as well admit I've done that once or twice
03that's junh1024's video
6..
6why do I have one sock
6where's the other :<
in your pillow
i used a custom edit of MPM'02 because i didn't like the MQ OP
6the dryer probably ate it
03I like the MQ OP :><
03*:<
03also
03where'd you get the instrumental of that narration?
03did you just edit the surround track?
the ENG ED is an edited version of "one world"
no, its on the M5 OST
03oh
03is it on the music FTP?
yes
03because it would be cool to narrate that myself xD
03but hm
03do we have a textless OPED?
03because it would be cool to recreate the English credits
i do
atoma redid it
03but SD? :/
yes
03because we have that 720p TV rip

omg the colours actually look decent

I had to futz the letters because Latios & Latias was pronounced Lashios and Lashias by Alex
i know
03I should just narrate it myself

03you can hatch them?
03hey, I'm still new to it
6 9 out of 10 times, you wont have it due to being on xbox
haha, 23 blocks/ores of coal in one area
6spawn eggs are in creative mode, released with the full version of PC/Mac minecraft
03also, diamonds are pretty rare... I've only found like 5 total
03so I made a diamond pickaxe
03that's all
6oh, 11 was spawn command
03OK
6diamonds are rare, yeah
03yeah, Xbox doesn't have creative mode yet
6everyone knows that
03that's what I mean
03hence why I want to give myself some :P
6but it doesn't take a godly amount to make full sets of everything
03it takes more than I have
03is what I'm getting at
6I know
03and well, I'm not sure how teh Xbox saves work, but often times they're just binary files like anything else
03I'll try it :P
6why buy the game if you're gonna spawn everything into your inventory lol
03uh
03for fu
03n
03I already got all the achievements
03so now I kinda just derp around and do stupid stuff
03XD
03since honestly it got boring after just a few days
03I think creative mode would be a lot more fun :P
6hence why you should have gotten it for computer :P
03I just don't like PC gaming :/
03despite my massive Steam library LOL
/me 6shrugs
03just personal preference I guess
6I don't know what notch's priority is with xbox version right now
03even on PC, I tend to use an Xbox controller
03well
6so you might not get much for a while
03yeah
03updates for Xbox are a bit odd
03because once you make one, you have to give it to Microsoft to approve
03to make sure it's not a virus or something
03and that can take a couple months sometime s>_>
03like when Valve fixed the broken achievement in Left 4 Dead, on Steam it was only a day or two, but we had to wait about a monht
03*month
03anyway brb shower
Minecraft just randomly froze
in a cave
wow
good work

6I feel like there should be a shiny trigger on that script kind of like the !eonget script
I'm surprised that cow
hasn't drowned yet O.o
Can cows drown?
03no
03well
03if you force them underwater deep enough yes
03but on their own, no
6they float :'D
there is a cow
in a pit I made
and it is floating inside a waterfall
:|
Yet I die when I go into it
6lol
6screenshot?
Hello again.
03well
Oh wait
So
:|
apparently
ladders
03you know what's both fun and incredibly sadistic?
block water
03Piss off wolves, then jump in water
03and go under
03let them float around confused
03then surface, they attack you, go back under
6oh yeah, ladders are funny things
No wonder it hasn't died yet
03repeat until you get bored
it's like
1/100 of a block in widt
th
and yet it blocks EVERYTHING
6yep
time to drown this cow for real
6you can do that with lava
Seeya later
6thats a common way for a mob farmer
Yup, he's dead now
Poor cow tried to save himself :(
03you know what else is fun?
interesting
03Walk up to an animal and pour a bucket of lava on it :D
6lol
03I actually killed two at once thatw ay
6flint works well too
03I also enjoy starting forest fires
03because well
03those stupid leaves
03need to gtfo
03I get all thew ood
6especially if you can do it right
03and have a bunch of leaves
03so I just set them on fire :D
6lava and fire will cook porkchops if you kill a pig with it
03HAHAHAHA NICE
6like i said
03I only killed cows and chickens that way
03that's awesome though
6some minecraft logic is so painfully awesome
03you know what annoyed me?
03I can't feed my wolf bread
03it has to be pork
03:/
03in real life I'm sure you could feed one bread? XD
6uh
6well dogs will eat anything
03exactly
6but they're primarily carnivores
03I had loads of bread
must be internet problems
03but didn't want to go to the mainland to kill pigs
6it's not really /healthy/ to feed dogs bread lol
03and my wolf is almost dead
03:/
6thats your own fault
03I never said it wasn't
6why is going to the mainland so bad lol
6if you're still on peaceful, nothings going to attack you
03hi
03and well, I set it on easy so I could get more bones, but of course kept fricking dying every time LOL
guess so :o
6alright whelp
03XD

Woah Sweetie Bell...why you creep me out?
/me cleans TheRainbowDash using windex
ok now ill listen to this when eve i watch pony
RAAAAAAGH
11,01Me neither, but Requiem disturbed me anyway.
Dermathil: no the movie which its from
/me cleans the stain Bronysith left
11,01It is THE anti-drug.
SHIPPINGS!!! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2993/
MaidCrafter: sweetiebot + lux aeterna
Throw my sistet in a barrel full of grape juice? Priceless.
it's the only anti-drug that works
Sister*
cachi01: ....English?
Shane377: I know that. But most people mistake it and call this song Requiem for a Dream instead of Lux Aeterna. And it is a pet peeves of mine.
Dken2021: try heroin. jk
MaidCrafter: sweetiebot + cool reuiem for a dream music
the thing that disturbed me the most in Requiem was that guys arm, still cant unsee ._.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4569/
Dermathil: I see, well, I've learnt something new today then
cachi01: Ya I know the song XD Is cool.
Mine too, twilight_sprinkler.
Indeed, Jim.
/me cringes
OH GOD xd
MaidCrafter: xdd
Dermathil: my biggest pet peeve is when people dont wanna die when its their time, makes my job a pain in the flank
*stares*
The thing is, Lux Aeterna is a classical piece that was used in 2001: a space odyssey, and this music ain't it.
11,01There's a 6-minute version of Lux Aeterna.
Gnight everypony
/me Aircrafter
11,01Night Michael
lol is this a legit vid on utube
gn Michael
its ok
DocSane: well its called lux aeterna
Goodnigth
nighty Michael
Now I'm wondering... Have we done a cross-over with Requiem yet?
/me 11,01dusts MaidCrafter
bye Michael! (waves and hugs)
Cya Michael
Maid_Discord, this is epic.
night Michael
Goodnight*

goodnight man
hehehe. I've already cheated death once, if you wanna talk about it. And I'm talking IRL.
bye Michael have fun
Oh, Sweetie-bot.

Maid_Discord: -cough- -Cough-
i needed it
so many pings
Maid_Discord, play lacramosa
Dermathil: wasnt your time, i let you go
making a crossover with ponies and the most depressing film ever.... oh god
-changes back to Aircrafter
11,01I'll play ponies properly now.
gaiz what ep would you recommend for getting a guy into ponies. i was thinking the sleepover one, or an ep that introduces all of the ponies, but not the first ep
The looks, make me also sad too. ._.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2051/
twilight_sprinkler: party of one
I'd go for Lesson Zero, myself.
hmm
Crush. Kill. Destroy. Acuqire Cutie Mark.:D
twilight_sprinkler maybe the season finales?
OMG yes
wOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHO
Heh. Tell that to the Carbon Monoxide leak.

HOW YOU DOING?
SMILE > THIS DAY ARIA
Aww yeah!
LYRA
/me smiles like a maniac
THERE I SAID IT
Dken2021: idk how well starting with the end would work
Bucket Dance!
WHATS UP
twilight_sprinkler: I'd say Party of One, Lesson Zero, or even Bridle Gossip. Flutterguy usually makes them like the show.
lol
HOWDY!
omg what song is this?
This song.. just makes ya glad.....
The 2nd best song of Season 2.:)
SMILE SMILE SMILE
*grins like an idiot*
Rain: smile smile smile :D
*troll face*
well Gnight everypony :3
Party of One plays up the expectations of people cynical about the show and then dashes them to pieces, so Party of One is best.
Cute seapony lyra
Roara
oh no
lux aeterna AND smile?? I FREAKING LOVE YOU
Lyra's enjoying her duckie
LOL
you has that? XD
who cares about transformers
how is it
Bye Tarku! (waves and hugs)
Ninjazz: ha flutterguy is indeed pretty cool
Tarku: night night
twilight_sprinkler well they aren't all in chronological order
Gn Tarku
TheRainbowDash: RIGHT AFTER SMILE CUZ IT TAKES ALL THREE TOP SPOTS
G'night Tarku
BEST SONG OF THE SEASON
the diablo 3 virus has spread to here
Night Tarku
twilight_sprinkler: Indeed! :)
Notice the rope continues to swing in background
TheHoodyMaid: No, This Day Aria is the number 1 spot, for sure/
Bronysith: Series*
Dken2021: i kno, ill think about it
Damn
Flare is bored
:P
I LIKE TO SEE U GRIN
:p
cachi01: D:
Bronysith: Nah, 2nd best of the season.
Is Diablo 3 fun tho
I've seen the CGI previews
TheRainbowDash: uh huh, whatever, have fun with your brain damage
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/funny-facebook-fails-god-pablo-youre-the-worst.png
TheRainbowDash: this day aria is so overhyped
which are NOTHING like the game IIRC
For some reason, Seapony Lyra is really annoying me by sitting in the middle of the stream...
SMILE IS BEST SONG
MaidChaser|Drunk: ...... Y SO SERIOUS!
TheHoodyMaid: no... its 4th best ^^
/me now needs to watch the best Warhammer tribute video ever that used Lux Aeterna.
Bronysith: What? I love that song, to death. Flawless as hay.:)
Flare needs more Octavia, brb.
I voted for this song as best song of S2.
I'm going to eat whatever food has just been put on the table.
Scoot lyra to the bottom of the screen... Out of Pinkie Pie's face xD
TheHoodyMaid: Brain damage? It is destroyed!
It came so close to winning, too.
i cant unsee pinkie slaughtering people in skyrim
So did I.
tl;dr. Lunch.
FlareChaser, you seem to be getting drunk a lot recently. everything ok?
THIS IS BEST SONG OF SEASON 2.
/me is now going to have to fight maidpanda
hmpf..
Bronysith: HECK YEAH
twilight_sprinkler: me neither. It really made me smile
all i think of is that skyrim vid when i hea this song
twilight_sprinkler: i know what you mean XD every down beat i picture a stab XD
MFW I come back to SMile Smile Smile.
Summon parade!
Its one of the top songs.
SMILE SMILE SMILE!
Rain: ....sure, everything is fine.
twilight_sprinkler: oh yeah THAT skyrim vid xDDD
Hmmm, 3rd best song of the show so far.
FillyFlam: is it good?
I'd say pretty much all the songs are epic... just good in their own ways
TheHoodyMaid: wait... you dont think "this day aria" was the best song?
Isn't this the longest song in the series?
Winter Wrap Up is my 2nd.:)
11,01I demand you smile, or I'll scrub your brains out!
TheHoodyMaid: Very.
best song of the series!
Best thing about this song is that it's crucial to setting up the conflict for the episode.
Daniel Ingram is best sonic pony.
TheRainbowDash: BECAUSE ITS 3RD, 2ND, AND 1ST
EVERYPONY SMILE!!!
Maid_Discord: thats a frightening image ._.
/me cleans stuff
Hey Flare look! Your waifu!
Ingram knows how to write lyrics WOOOOOHOO
TheHoodyMaid: (sighs) No, it isn't. Just 3rd.
Octavia time :|
the 2nd one is this day aria
COME ON A SMILE!
only a donkey can ruin this
11,01Back to Val.
NO
Maid_Discord: hehe thank you for that :D
TheRainbowDash: ... And 2nd and 1st
GOD NO
Hay
6it's pretty fun yeah
cachi01: honestly. i dont like this day aria
6I love it
FlareChaser: whats wrong?
Ah have no waifu!
http://i.imgur.com/8k8Cs.jpg
TheHoodyMaid: I am done.
good thing im immune to trolling
lawl
back to awsome
maidpanda: I didn't think This Day Aria was the best song. This song REDEEMED Pinkie Pie in my mind. She was getting on my nerves in the episodes leading up to that one.
Yes!
BIG O!!!!!!
2,14 and we're back
Bronysith: u havnt heard the metal version lol
Chrysalis bwahahahah
I love this day aria
iT'S SHOWTIME!
TheHoodyMaid: Wait, hold up, trolling?
cachi01: i dont care
6and no I'm not on server errors
6that happened for the first day
DeathMaid|sick: maidpanda http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4755/ when i saw MLP toys in happy meals at macdonalds
cachi01: i dont like this day aria
TheRainbowDash: not you
Welcome back, ValtheJean. It's cropped a bit too much.
i luv smile smile smile......A LOT!!!
That is not scientifically possible.:D
i like that robot design, not too flashy
VAL THANK YOU BIG O
lol Shane377|Muffinman
6blizzard promtly shut the servers down, fixed it, and put them back up
Kandarihu|H8s2Clean: hm? well pinkie never got on my nerves, so no redemtion needed XD
Bronysith: lol well everyone has their own likes
I can hold all these ships!
lol Shane377|Muffinman
how did big o get into space
????
Kid_Cobalt: my bad
cachi01: i mean its okay. but there are so many better songs
11,01I might stream later tonight, and I promise it won't as creepy and/or depressing as the intermission.
Pinkie seems to be Hasbro's face of the show to the world. It's like Twilight doesn't exist.
here we go... SOME AWESOME!
Big O has some of the best battle music ever.
engineer
6anyways
TheHoodyMaid: lol??
Giant wrench
that's one giant wrench
Maid_Discord: Yeah, just pain and torture with G3 ponies, right?
that wasnt depressing, Maid_Discord
cachi01: winter wrap up and at teh gala and smile and may the best pet win are all better
6i'm gonna shut firefox down for now
6bbl
TheRainbowDash: smile is bst pony song this day aria is the 2nd and in my opinion the cutie mark crusaders is the 3rd
DocSane: its the mane 6, not the mane 1
Must still be a memory hog!
it's piloted by the Engineer!
Well
Bronysith: i dont like winter wrap up
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4806/ when i remember at MacDonalds u have to ask for which toy you want in the happy meal
I just felt that some of her jokes were distracting from the story at hand. And yet I didn't get that feeling when I showed this to my mom for my 2nd viewing.
Old joke
Bronysith: than what?
lol
cachi01: whatever
Bronysith for some reason i simply like *This day aria* with chrysalis singing it and the cadence+chrysalis part of it smile is 2nd on my list though i just like villain songs over happy and cheering songs 6_9
DAT EXPLOSION!
11,01I think G3 is funny because of how bad it is.
damn it i stil ldont like that Federer lost to Djokovic...
DYNAMIC KILL
Yeah, but Pinkie is always used in all the ads.
cachi01: Eh, decent list, at best. 1. This Day Aria. 2. Winter Wrap Up. 3. Smile.
11,01"Rainbows, darling, rainbows."
G3 is just torture.
SEND DAI-GUARD VAL YES GOGOGOG DAI-GUARD
Maid_Discord: Uh-oh, Val may not like that...:S
Octavia <3
Pinkie Pie is the MLP mascot
mfw Love Is In Bloom doesn't make the top three
G3 seems to be MLP as made by people who hate children.
G3 was written for little girls. G4 was written for Human Beings, which includes little girls and more.
DAI-GUARDO
wait... ValtheJean where is caramel?
1. Winter Wrap up. 2. May the best pet win. 3. Smile/At the gala
Kencolt: human beings xD

twilight_sprinkler: very good
Rain: Run. now

eater of worlds
Woah, what the hay?!
Bronysith I find Searching for Friends so much enjoyable
otakon: sry but you walked right into that
TheHoodyMaid, if I were to run, it would mean that I dont stand by what I said, which I do stand by whole heartedly.
So, Valthejean, any idea when the dimensional beasts will show up again?
TheRainbowDash: ^^' Kinda hard not to after "that" huh?
Dken2021: i like jecht battle from FFX
Bronysith: That's what she said
brb
Rain: but i dont feel like working right now

2,14 they were defeated the last game, and only fragments remain
i like the regular battle theme
2,14 they might not be the enemies in the final mission, but we'll see
DARNIT WHY DID I MISS THAT
ValtheJean: you arent mad at me now are you? :(
I'm still amazed at the animation in this.
What mission are you now?
Ninjazz: Yes, it is very hard. In fact, almost impossible.
Did you pass Mission 54?
is this code geass?
2,14 58: third to last
AGH
I MISSED 54
besides, TheHoodyMaid, he seems to have either not seen it, or ignored it.
2,14 eeyup
cachi01: did u finish reading it?
TheRainbowDash: Well, if it makes you feel better. I do regret being quite a pussy back then. :(
Did you do 54A or 54B Valthejean?
ValtheJean: when you finish up this game, you should playthrough Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance
Rain: not anymore, i guess :p
03http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/koma-comic-strip-untitled19.jpg
Ninjazz: Oh, ummm, sure.....want to do anything...you know....

Midnight_Shadow: what if he used ALL of his clothing :o
Nine hours and 55 minutes until she may come back to us all. Remember, "It could happen". I'm not saying it will happen, just that it could.
This attack from Nu Gundam was the attack that used the most of the budget in Hakai-Hen
Is that Amuro Ray piloting?

Bronies4evar: the way you said episode 214 people could've understood that it was from a show with 214 episodes, rather than episode 14 season 2.
2.14
^^
we just need a giant can of Space Raid!
14.2
Indeed :D
i wish
The Aquabats would clear this

TheHoodyNinja: I'm sick fix it
Like the first two episodes is coded episode 101 and 102.
/me poofs
Is this almost over?
DeathStar|sick: how do you want me to help?
SparklyWaffles: we still got a few tunrs left i think..
TheHoodyNinja: I dunno :(
And I have no idea what robot this is.
Kencolt: looks like a girl
2,14 Kencolt: that's because she's original to this game
I know Bronies4evar. But that is the technical designation. Official is Season 1 episode 1-2.
2,14 Margarett, Brasta and Esther are all originals in this game
ok
Remember, on January the twenty-first at four minutes past ten in the morning?
ZOMFG WHAT IS THAT!?
nice dodge
Brasta is epig.
pikorar: Giant Space WOrm
I just got on and saw a giant spaceworm.
2,14 derma: just wait
pikorar: ikr?
pikorar one solution: giant robots
2,14 I'm saving his CDS to finish off that worm
OH HELL YES
coolio Val.
DeathStar|sick: I have three solutions. 1: beat the germs with a bucket. 2: eat the virus away. 3: sit there and do nothing
Dken2021: Transformers 4 plot right there.
ofc
MFW I watch the battles on the stream: http://derpy.me/O2HBt
omg
pikorar: that would be epic
TheHoodyNinja: try no.!
no.1*
Okay, everyone, tell me: Best examples of MLP fan music that aren't Mic the Microphone and PinkiePieSwear. GOQ!
The Derp-bomb made the servers explode.
hahah Setsuna and his copilot are epic.

.......holy hell
/me shrinks down to microscopic size and goes inside DeathStar|sick's ear to combat the germs witha bucket
MWAHAHAHAHA
That did it. Whatever it was, that did it.
and it's STILL NOT DEAD!
Yeah, TheHoodyNinja, but I'm afraid that the giant spaceworms will sue... I'm sure that would be considered discrimination against their relatively peaceful race.
No, wait, it didn't?
O__O that damage
9000 over 9000 OVER 9000
Nommed
otakon: watch 00gundam to see this attack in its full glory.
so I ate 15 sticks of Extra Strawberry shortcake gum in a day, what's wrong with me?
2,14 hmmmm
Dken2021: hehe :D
/me dusts otakon
this sucks.
2,14 I can't decide who should get the finishing blow
I'm bored
GURREN LAGANN SHOULD
BjornMaid: maid hrs over
Heh... Blow.
lololo
2,14 alright chat, decide who finishes that work
SIMON, ValtheJean
ValtheJean: Raxpheon?
pikorar: I already wiped them all out, pretty sure you cant sue someone if your dead
2,14 but it has to be one of the ones near it
Gurren Lagann
you
Big-O!
Dken2021: There's nothing wrong with you, wait 2 sec, I'll get a picture
damn
ValtheJean: BATMAN

Thanks for reminding us, Shamroc.
ValtheJean: Raxpheon?
2,14 Gurren Lagann isn't near it
ValtheJean: the small guy with the swords...

Screw it imma do it anyway XD
:) http://www.fimfiction.net/story/17916/Echoes-of-the-Past Kid_Cobalt
ValtheJean, how come Goddannar isnt in this?
riptos rage was good, I was very close to 100% completion of the game
Because Goddannar was awful?
I'm on the last world, I just havent had a chance to go back to the game
panda: not every robot ever is in every game ever.
Where was Gondor when Goddannar wasn't in this?
Nu Gundam!
2,14 you would have to ask the game designers
Is Nadesico in this?
You have a roster every game.
2,14 Nadesico was in the GBA game
dem lazer fingers..
Dermathil: well... im just asking ^^
Kandarihu: no, but Martian invader Nadesico was in Super Robot War J.
Ninjazz: Where was gondor when giant worms and robots fought in outer space?
I know. I played J, although not to the end
dedged
for no reason
I think J was the only one with Nadesico in it AFAIK
TheHoodyNinja: I HAVE NO IDEAAAH!
Whoa, they're righting stomach worms now?
That was a weird combination of ded and dodged o_o
drone attacks are best
Last shooting!
2,14 damn it nu gundam...stop doing more damage than I think you will -_-
'splosion
ValtheJean: isn't that a GOOD thing?
Year of the Dragon was very good too. You get to play with lots of different characters.
dude thats over kill
2,14 I wanted Brasta to kill it ;_;
42K hitpoints? We advanced a lot since I left o3o
yet agian less than i was expecting
http://media-cache3.pinterest.com/upload/186336503302745856_eFn45Lfk_b.jpg challenge accepted.
Nu Gundam is op as all hell, Val. You should know this by now.
03hm
03Save20120511052822.bin <- that's the Xbox save file for Minecraft
otakon: he wants to give certain mechs the finishers
03what format are they for PC?
Not drones. They are called-- wait for it-- bits.
/me looks at his 12 inch Nu Gundam on the mantel piece...
Tried any of the GBA games?
Wait... Why are you killing giant monsters? What happened to the gaint robots?
oh right. I forgot they're called bits.
SparklyWaffles nice nail art there
Ninjazz: they are Shin Getter monsters
2,14 because it's doing Getters storyline
No I haven't unfortunately.
Whatst the best way to remove warts? Cutting them off with scissors, digging it out with a stapler, or that weird freezing stuff?
Excuse me, what fuckery is this?
2,14 and Getter fights Getter Beasts
:O it's on gba?
Although those bits are NOT accepted at Sugarcube Corner.
Dermathil: No, they're funnels.
I see.
and Getter fights Dinosaurs
year of the dragon? no but its on PSP for download
TheHoodyNinja I heard freezing it works
eh. DocSane: I remember Lockon Stratos has gun bits and shield bits.
What is this..
Onebrony: a video game
anyone here got a xbox?
I own a PSP.
/me looks at her 12 inch Hitsuguya figure on her bookshelf
ValtheJean: the hell are these giant bugs that you're fighting?
I didn't watch the anime that had Nu gundam. So I don't really know.
Dermathil: Oh, thought you were talking about Nu Gundam.
otakon: GETTER BEASTS
my psp died
I almost never like downloading games
rawr there Dermathil
Dermathil: The Hell is a Getter Beast?
i want one Rain :(
DocSane I was talking about them in general
I always prefer physical, especially if you want to sell it later on
Dermathil: you didnt watch Char's Counterattack?
I own a GBA too!
otakon: enemies in the Getter Robo show?
What do they get, these Getter Beasts?
what happened to your PSP?
otakon: its a black woman with too much makeup on
TheHoodyNinja, Hitsuguya is best captian
:3
WallDives: never had the chance to get my hands on a copy
i sense EXTREME OVERKILL!
/me dances sleepily
I still have my PSP.
whether by the internet or IRL
"Time is... 7:56 am"
otakon: Getter beasts were giant monsters in Getter Robo, that the heroes fought.
2,14 okay Dermathil
Dermathil: Bits were used in original Gundam by the Elmes. They were refined into funnels in Zeta Gundam and after.
"Time is... 7:57 am"
2,14 time for CDS
2,14 you might want to hold on you your pants
DocSane: oh cool.
"Time is... 7:58 am"
BRING IT ON
so, anybody else here see the newest episode of Young Justice?
VALTHEJEAN, BRING IT
RAWRity: nope
/me does not need pants
uh
what pants?
ValtheJean: im wearing shorts...can i still hold on to them?
I own the physical games themselves too.
"Time is... 7:59 am. The show begins in a minute."
Dermathil: Funnels originally had a funnel shape, but the shape varied by the time we got to Char's Counterattack.
coolio.
RAWRity: My sister probably has
I'd check except I'm playing a game
What...:D
Not that she'd share with me.
I know that in 00Gundam they use bits though.
Be the bullet.
OVERKILL
This game, wow, so random.
Dermathil: Nu Gundam had folding "fin funnels" while most Neo-Zeon units used cylindrical funnels.
very much overkill
RAWRity: LadyCanary probably has
no kill like overkill
Ninjazz: I can not be the bullet. Rather just a Dashie.
"Time is... eight o'clock. "The last roundup is airing now on The Hub. Tune your tv's now."
over 30000
Maybe I should just stand there while she's trying to watch a show, since she'll pause it.
he could have killed that thing by himself :D
That way she'll never finish it.
no the joystick thing got messed up some how
Hi everypony!
AH THAT'S THE NAME. Fin Funnel. I kept using drones since I forgot about it (had read about it somewhere, I think it was tvtropes about 3-4 months ago)
it scrolls by itself
Because she won't unpause it until I leave
hi Pinkie_Kittie
Viril!
TheRainbowDash: I'm sure you can be whatever you put your mind to. But being a Dashie is what you do best! ;)
hey Pinkie_Kittie
Hello Pinkie_Kittie.
"Time is... 8:01 am. Three minutes to the scene of faith, three minutes!"
Um, not where I am. Hub is showing Alvin and the Chipmunks meet Frankenstein.
Ninjazz: Dashie is best..well, pony.:D
BIG O
/me gives Pinkie_Kittie a bath because he/she missed maid hour
YES
TheRainbowDash: Now, now... :|
I am practicing my countdown to derpy.

"Time is... 8:02 am. Two minutes to the scene of faith, two minutes!"
yeah sounds like its worn out
I heard dat theme and I was like MAH PEEPS
Damn, that hurt
TheHoodyNinja: Oh...umm, I rightfully disagree.
Just lovely, TheRainbowDash. Thanks for the hugs!
Bronies4evar: what the heck are you raving on about?
Brace yourself, Bronies4evar. :(

Who wants to make new toons on WoW?
PLAY GLOMMY SUNDAY
Once upon a time, in the magical land of explosions

It's similar to the original Spyro games.
Pinkie
RaveBrony: Come on, were gonna start new toons on WoW.
Jim: Michael Bay was born
11,01dishwasher_EXTREME: Don't make me play G3.
oh nvm
see? even pinkie says Twily is best pony!
lol
I hate it!:[
boom
XD
hmmm
No? No one wants to make new toons on WoW?
interesting
seriously?
XD
twilight_sprinkler: thats becaus she cant say shes the best pony without sounding vain
I dont play WoW.
OMG SO MANY BOOMS!!!!!!!!!!!
FlareChaser: Sorry, im working on LoreMaster :D
Rarity, I hate it.
Toons?
XD
Directed by Michael Bay, because that probably hasn't been said before.
RaveBrony: LoreMaster? whats that?
/sarcasm
lol
lolz
XD
i only have xbox 360, wii, ds, gba sp, & a dead psp
I think that fire does not equal explosion.
oh no
Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy for the PS2 is a lot like Banjo Kazooie.
Jim: Just new characters :P
Hahaha:D
BOOM
Those aren't Michael Bay's style. Those look like old nuclear bomb tests.
of all the songs winter wrap up was my least favourite
never heard of that one
cuz tomorrow spring is BOOOOOM!
FlareChaser: Completing just about every quest in WoW :P
Technically an explosion is just really fast combustion.
Haven't played WoW in like a year
I think.
Well, since I'm not too particularly fond of this video, I shall just go back to Reading.
RaveBrony: oh yeah, derp :
What are we watching?? :D
More smoke than fire.

You know, as for the exploding twice. The IDF posted a video of bombing a hidden Palestinian weapons cache that I think would be great stock footage for double explosions.

13mic volume is maxed
ECHHHHOOOOO
Yukari Y. maintains and changes gensyoku borders. Sie sleeps most of the day, and has a maid
otakon: well thats a boring response.
O.O
13it's echoing cause he's on stereo mix is all
My consciousness is drifting......
ECHOOWOOOWOOOWOO
Nittany_Discord, theres feedback
who would honestly think this was a movie...
13can you check boost gain?
barely
she sometimes trolls, but she usually has "best intrests at heart"
hardly...
13Phase4: it's cause it's echoing through to stereo mix, that's going to fmle
You know, headphones are a must if you want to avoid feedback.
02XD
11,01It's VAC.
No one can defeat the Fobby
/me 11,01is getting frustrated
13or whichever one is capturing the audio yeah
13it'll be all right, go on with calibration~
Depressed_Tempest: who would honestly think someone would seriously think this is a movie.
11,01What I say in my mic comes out of my speakers.
get playin!
11,01So there's problem 1.
she is well-endowed, has a hat, medium-long-long hair, and reb ribbon on her head.
Gee, it sure is boring around here! :$
*red
hey what was the song yesterday with pinkie pie that goes like "shanana oonunn e num num"
Shizuka So your name is pronounced SHI-zu-ka?
13PartyCannon: yes >>
Now I am confused.
MrFobby they are trying to get something set up. :v
AW YEA
or is it proounced zhizukaehgauuuuugh
in marsian i mean
00,10Suppose I will have to teach Nitt how to set up mics and such
13anyway nittany my backup idea would be to have everything on line 2, line 2 echoes out to speakers and line 1, then put mic straight to line 1 for fmle to capture
13that way stream picks up the mic but you don't get it on speakers
oh Nittany is streaming portal 2
you use portals in the game Portal
NO WAY
00,10bingo Shizuka
13don't get worked up over it, go on with testing~
for science!
08,01who is a better sister?
08,01AJ or RRT?
00,10but you also need to use audio repeater
rrt?
^
RRT? is that rarity?
00,10AJ
RRT
08,01Rarity is a better sister than AJ?
08,01SRSLY?
AJ is probably better, but id prefer to have Rarity as a sister
08,01i think i'd prefer AJ as a sister
13yeah which detached it from stream's input, it's okay go on~
AJ is better sister if it's against Rarity
w
Hater
08,01panda: i just realised the other day how sexy AJ is
:O
08,01and it came about from a joke about apple bucking.
wat?
Wait, huh?
._.
08,01panda: well, she obviously has strong legs and good stamina
^
:O

POINT AT ALL THE THINGS!
DeathStar|sick: good point
08,01DeathStar|sick: wait... good point.
11,01I don't know why, but my current might was perfect when I made the awards show recordings.
lol
my internet might go off
11,01It's degraded ever since.
As much as I'd like to watch this, I need to restart my computer.

11,01Shizuka: I'll set it up before I quit stream, but I'll need to get my mic problems sorted out before today.
/me 08,01has only had terrestrial TV
WallDives It could be a reskin of the Adult Swim anime portion
Nittany_Discord are u playing portal
PartyCannon: probably, but I'm way to jaded from anime oversaturation.
nope he's playing Left 3 Life episode 22
08,01i never really watched much TV growing up anyway
JRP2234: It is Nittany and emangamer playing Portal.
No he's playing Call of Duty
08,01i've never been a fan of it
08,01i spent my childhood programming computers and making bombs
TV is our master...
Nittany_Discord can u help me complete the portal to co-op
MrFobby: Ah, I see, this is just another one of those easter eggs then.:D
08,01twilight_sprinkler: i refuse to have a TV in my house

Well, I'm back. And my virus scan is starting in 15 minutes.

Controller tesle coil by a computer? Cool.
08,01TheRainbowDash: yup! it's gonna have a solid-state spark gap
jelly much?
emangamer: say it :|

08,01used the HV transformers from those
I'm back!
12yes
12I am me again :"D
08,01and the capacitors i put into the Tesla coil

08,01so i had 4 of these things, and i had to cool them down some how
03yes, I'm totally holding her at gunpoint and forcing her to type that

Woah, what are the two robots doing?

They're making circuits

08,01panda: of course, so long as you don't put the hard drive in
u silly guis :3
08,01the whole point is that mineral oil is an insulator
oh just put that portal right the....AASFRGHG'SRFHGSDSA
08,01TheRainbowDash: yup, it would
No more RRoD TheRainbowDash
Wow. Amazing!:)
Nittany_Discord: do you play with ppl that have co-op done?

08,01you probably want to pump the mineral oil to some kind of radiator/heatsink, though
NOOOO DASH
08,01for a PC
08,01the main reason i used it for HV is that it's a very good insulator
08,01PartyCannon: awesome!

hiya xmasskills
hello otakon
my favorite video game soundtrack has to be Assassins Creed II's it was amazing :|
DeathStar|sick: feeling any less yuck?
08,01distilled water actually has a higher breakdown voltage than mineral oil, which itself has a higher breakdown voltage than air
otakon: a little
sooooo whats up?
I never noticed the soundtrack... I don't really pay too much attention
08,01but i didn't want to use distilled water, because it becomes undistilled quite quickly
derp

Soap is good. It makes you not smell like a stereotype

/me rages at the complainers
So he ... isn't coming back, but he still has Internet
WHO SHALL STREAM
Kriel_Pony: wait wut lol

13rain rain~<3
Oh you beach
/me never gets any love
i didnt knew shizuka was a beach
hmm. Complaining about not having stream or complained about having stream?
OMG WE NEED TO HAVE A PUN WAR
13both
oh gawd, not the puns
"at the crime scene. LOL"
lol
13see it's like this
How many ponies have I pm'd? :D
Hello. I am a Brony. Basically...Friendship.
13we stay up til godawful hours
lol
Mahboi777 what shall the puns be about
^ Shizuka
13tweak every little thing about our computers to make them capable of streaming high quality video and audio to you
13we select interesting things that we like and that our viewers have shown interest in
13and people just bitch and complain the whole time
04I'm here in the Summer from 4 AM to 7 AM my time
ouchies
/) Ghosties
13breaks my decorum to say it but there it is... it's maddening to do what we do only to see everyone complaining
(\
Shizuka: welcome to the internet, sadly mostly populated by whiners
Right now its 11:30 PM. I usually hang around here between 9PM - 12AM
04\) 4thWall
QUICK, EVERYONE. WHAT'S THE MEANING OF LIFE?
/me hugs Shizuka
04You kids and your fangled emoticon things
SparklyWaffles, 43
lol
:'( I'm sorry Shizuka
04Back in my day there was only two emoticons
Ghosties, upside down brohoof XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=hHkKJfcBXcw
04:) and :(
13Firaga_Rain: thing is, we don't have to do this
: ) and : ( ?
04Only two
SparklyWaffles: DINNER
13if you're so goddamned bored and desperate for x y or z, go to youtube
/me hugs Shizuka
LOL
hehe
13we stream what we want to stream because we like it and because our viewers like it
lets all roleplay
Shizuka: Unfortunately, those who don't complain can do little about those who do
Ghosties: man, i like thatcan't even think
I love coming here and watching new stuff and stuff I haven't ever seen or thought existed.
*think like that
/me hugs Shizuka
Shizuka: most of the complains i see are from people who would like this stream to be ponies 24/7
I also like just chatting when there isn't stream, sharing vids and the like
ok somone stream newborn cutire
cuties
04Well yeah, but this site isn't just about ponies
13then they can read the FAQ sitting 200 pixels above the chat box
04It was never just about ponies
But I don't think I "complained" If I didn't like it, I'd leave to do my fic or play a game.
I always like the stream lol
04It was about you guys
13wherein it says quite clearly we don't stream ponies 24/7
/me laughs evily
I have actually learned some interesting stuff from the stream....
The only thing that nerved me was if there was buffer lag for 30min straight
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdAmkx8eAos Bronystate welcome to die
/me shoots exploding lazors
I think streaming ponies 24/7 would get old. I have netflix, I can watch ponies on my own terms.
/me pokes Derpy_Hooves with a balloon
/me deflates
it wud definitely get old
When did the /me script come along?
shizuka: i actually have nothing but respect for people who take some of their time to bring entertainment to others, thats why i like it here so much
04The point is you guys come here to enjoy the company of each other and to see what's on the stream
Dr. Who? Learned it all here. FMA? All here. Dr Jekyl / Mr Hyde? here.
to those demanding ponies: http://youtu.be/o-NIlytkbVk
^ghosties
04It's very much a "friend" atmosphere
Ghosties: That is the truth :)

MahBoi777: Thank you ;)
Lets all go to 4chan! :D
TaviChaser: One, im hunting the TLPD atm, and two, im not a fan of making new characters :( ....i only have ONE 85 for a reason :D
04Gravy is like fancy sauce but not really. It's a Southerner's "sauce"
http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/02/29/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-i-propose-a-new-rule/ here.
dshannon: Only when there is a stream :)
I like gravy
wait...
Ghosties see it's saucy
that song is bronystates fav song?
^^
RaveBrony: I have 1 85 as well :| and lol I already got the TLPD
only when requests are open and that's in a different chat channel
04And I don't believe that "sauce" thing one bit, come down to the south and you'll see we don't call it a "sauce"
flutter_spin: YES! F*CKIN YES!
panda: Its our official Theme Song
04"Sauce" is A1
SB LOVES IT
gonna skate to one song, and one song only
flutter_spin: wait really???????
I love the south xD
04Sauce is steak sauce here
i always have snipping tool open
what about soy sauce?
incase of dire need to scrnshot
Ghosties that was an amazing and enlightning speil
but as far is i know gravy is and it always will be a sauce
as*
TaviChaser: Ive never tried looking for it before :O I saw it once...and i was questing so i thot nothing of it (didnt know about the mount drop)...and then 10 seconds later someone is hollering out that they got it
04And occasionally duck sauce, and soy sauce, but you'll have to forgive us we just got Chinese food like last Thursday so we're getting situated to this mindblowing discovery
o_o
mmmmmmm gravy
RaveBrony: ahahahaha owned
Ghosties: wat
TaviChaser: Yeah :D
RaveBrony: that must of been me! :D

fuck gravy, BBQ sauce is the shit
I think I'll make some mashed taters and gravy now
im guessing Gosthies is from brazil
cause Ghosties made me hungry
TaviChaser: Lol, where is the best place to look for it?
...can I make a sexual joke?
oh and I CANT FORGET this one... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aih_-483uVk&list=PLB8193CFD93A5F29C&index=7&feature=plpp_video

NIT?
No wait Nittany_Discord

Nittany_Discord: I have one more thing to say.
http://scranton.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw1237_Twilight_Sparkle_nope_nope_nope.gif
11,01Sorry for the frustration.
PONIES! :D
0.o
04SC is southern, but you're not on the team :P
11,01Everyone.
11,01Sorry for getting frustrated.
11,01Between mic problems, Portal 2 lagging and other things, I'm just easily annoyed right now.
11,01And a lot of you know that I'm going through a rough patch (again).
donde everyone
/me pats Nitt's back "S'ok, we all have off days :/"
0,5Rough patch? Well mow the lawn
0,5WAit, why is there a +m
0,5o:
ssorry, i suck at multitasking.
11,01It's very rough.
11,01On the other hand, please lay off of streamers.
0,5Viewers giving streamers crap?
0,5How shocking -_-
11,01Some do.
hallo
11,01We're hear on our free time to stream for you.
hi
0,5Lemme guess: No ponies = we dont like stream?
11,01And if you don't like what's streaming, don't watch it.
04Just direct them to our mission statement
11,01Exactly.
donde vivo?
awww
0,5Also
busy with stuff?
0,5complaining about streams will NOT get you what you want
0,5just saying
here it is btw: http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/
04Well
04Um
11,01We're not slaves to you.
04It *will* give them ponies in some instances
04...just, you know
11,01Yeah.
04Not the ponies *you* want
0,5Oh boy
not g4
0,5Haha
if your lucky, not g3.6
0,5There is a 3.6?
08,01bum bum bum.
11,01Anyway, I like this place. I just am in shitty times, so forgive my attitude.
04Look guys, it's simple. Don't like what's on stream? Then talk to the others in the chat or just go play a game or something until the stream is over. Simple.
08,01oh hey, we're on +m
11,01Yeah.
i come back to a +m :o
0,5Thats a nicerr way to put it Ghosties, yeah
11,01I needed to say some stuff after I got frustrated and killed the stream.
0,5If you want my way just keep complaining and we'll see how I respond to you.
11,01I'm done.
0,5(You being the viewers, not you Ghosties.)
11,01Thank you everyone.
0,5Or is it you? O:
04Try not to heckle the streamers, please. That's the short end of the stick ^_^
11,01Lol.
08,01also, don't shout laaaaaaaag when it lags; that helps no-one, and is annoying.
0,5Now, ironically, Im not a streamer
0,5BUT
11,01Maybe one day LC.
04Anyways
0,5Nah
04This +m is kinda gone on for a while
0,5Computer isnt cut out for it
0,5It has been
04So
11,01K.
0,5So.
04Yeah
my internet is going to sh*t
0,5Soso.
13psst lc
04Don't wanna push things
13you have streamed before
0,5I have

/me hugs Nittany_Discord "Sorry, bout the crap people been giving you, man"
Nittany_Discord It's okay man. Thanks for streaming awesome stuff mods. :)

I feel I owe SB64 an apology.
....this download is going at 11kbps
Nittany_Discord: Want a hug?
08,01what colour is phase4?
LordCelestia, 3.6 is baby cuties and the like
Nittany_Discord: there is one thing you might be able to do about the lag: run the game at a lower resolution. If that means that you'd have to become all squinty-eyed, you can turn down the resolution of your entire computer.
I'm sorry
hey TheHoodyNinja
04Clear color :D
0,5I thought that was 3.5
Litwick: Nit got hit by complainers. They went into +m
Derpy_Hooves i think i'm in love... it sounds like an owlcity song ^^

04And I'm not even a fan of RD that much, but the backlash would be *amazing*
SuperBrony64: did u alrdy find someone to play portal coop with?
JRP2234: It can run games, so its a platform
I did try to leave when that happened but my rage was a withdraw symptom
Shamroc: the assassin's creed deluxe pack
13[23:51] [ Pinkies4thWall] SuperBrony64: I've never heard you speak, are you a mute or something?
uh
/me 13is practically mute .-.
I would not be fond of the Rainbow Dash show. Not enough Rarity.
08,01TheHoodyNinja: stress -> high blood pressure -> heart attack -> death
Derpy_Hooves..............i want..........so much......lol
/me hugs Shizuka
08,01TheHoodyNinja: or even stress -> depression -> suicide -> death
wait Shizuka u cant talk?
Ninjazz: The rariry show on the other hand....
Shizuka: don't be mute!
DeathStar|sick: feel better
lol Ninjazz
04Now
04See
08,01TheHoodyNinja: caused by stress
13not can't.. i just don't
04The only true spin off
Shizuka: so the voice synth on the toms is the most we'll get from you?
cachi01: no, she owns no mic and doesn't want to talk.
Shamroc: Remember..... 8 am EST 2day.
Firaga_Rain: Wouldn't that be simply marvelous?!
Giraga_Rain: Agreed
Shizuka: oooooooh
comes with AC1, ACII, AC brotherhood, AC revelations, and ALL current AC DLC
04Is The Applejack Show, starring the Apple Family!
/me is bored
Bronies4evar: ok?
Ghosties: XD
oh great a mlp sitcom
13not even among family... just don't talk that much..
/me comes up from behind
Ghosties CMC show is better
BOO!
/me hiddes
Derpy_Hooves...never played an AC game in my life...always wanted to though...oh well
Ghosties: Eh, I'd watch it
-d
08,01TheHoodyNinja: hahahahaha
^
Um...why are we talking about death? Shouldn't we be more...lighthearted?
08,01TheHoodyNinja: try organising a convention then get back to me.
/me hugs Shizuka. Friendship?
13and re microphone, extremely bad experience with random internet people before
Ghosties more like staring anyone except applejack :p
Shizuka: aw.....:(
wuh
Shizuka: Is it a condition, or do you choose to?
i see there is no stream so..
Sylandest: k then lets talk aboout........ dead?
AJ needs more love ! go and love AJ!
Shizuka: You don't trust most of us?
The legend of Spike: The quest for Rarity's "jewels"
04Join Applejack as she tries to control the family business on Sweet Apple Acres and not lose her sanity from dealing with her crazy yet loveable family
Nittany_Discord, try turning off aero, it improves streaming performance quite a bit
13not a condition no, i just don't
panda: yfw he's got no pink hair left
cachi01: XD
Firaga_Rain: -_^
Shizuka: im gonna guess...."OMFG WOMEN GET BACK IN KITHCEN AND MAKE ME SAMMICH" ?
Ninjazz: don't bother her about it.
Sme
same*
otakon: wait... he said earlier that he had pink hair!
Ghosties dat logline
Shamroc: don't bother her abou it.
panda: he HAD
otakon: :(
I used to have pink hair...
Shizuka: YES MAAM!
Ninjazz: you are, just move on.
04And The Applejack Show comes complete with sitcom cues and everything
It was AWESOME!
08,01Shizuka: i think i just fell in love <3
..in west ponyville born and raised...
but then u took a what to the what?
o-o
otakon: Very well. You seem to know more than I do.
/me wishes he had Pinkie hair
y'alls crazy
Ninjazz: not really, but it's touchy to say the least.
04Episode 1: Applejack gets a catchphrase
13the Twilight Sparkle Show would be on discovery channel
08,01seriously though, that made me laugh so hard, shizu
otakon: Indeed.
＼(。ヮ°)ノ ☆ ～☆!
I tried to dye my hair red, turned pink, complete badassery
Pinkies4thWall: pink is manliest color lol
04Episode 2: Big Mac becomes an expy
Pinkie Pie Show on Cooking Network?
Firaga: I ... am not sure I would watch that one
:D yep Shizuka
13the Rarity Show would be on TLC
hey Shizuka did you ever accept my steam freind invite?
08,01Ghosties: an expy?
13believe i did
Ghosties: well, if you know any animators I could totally help with writing :D
Shizuka: Lol!! :D
11,02Pinkies4thWall: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0GgHZKfLaA3
the pinkie pie show would be censored in the world because tv cant stand so much awesomness
my black friend died his afro pink for me, and he wore a pinkie shirt to school
FLuttershy on Animal Planet?
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Shamroc: You said derpy, so I reminded you.
03http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/412037_10150853250409652_558849651_9878403_1806899936_o.jpg
13Pinkie Pie Show would be on disney
03yay
03I healed it
OH NO
pork
SuperBrony64|McD: Hiya!!! :)
?
03yes
04Expy, as in a specific quirk or trait of a character becomes its defining attribute
Shizuka: FUCK THAT its on CN
04Though
11,02Hai :D
Bronies4evar.....yeah no i didnt
03I went and killed like 5 pigs
good job
TheHoodyNinja: agree
08,01The Molestia Show.
03now all I need is bones so I can do more stuff
Dat Dr. SuperBrony64|McD.
13fluttershy wouldn't have a show, or else it would be on Discovery Channel during the "shows about people with psych issues" blocks
08,01i'd watch it.
Ghosties: he becomes an expy for constanza
04Big Mac is already pretty much an expy...kinda, Studio B is doing a pretty good job of not making him purely a running gag
SuperBrony64|McD: so like, moo?
SuperBrony64|McD: Dat voice
03but I don't really want to put it on a harder difficulty
03LOL
11,02Moo ^-^
epic voice
hai SuperBrony64|McD how is League of legends going ? did you like it ?
13i thought expy was a character that feels like it was taken from another show
SuperBrony64|McD: MOO INDEED...also moo
No moos!
11,02It cool :3
the derpy show?
11,02brb ^-^
SuperBrony64|McD: i now request freind request on LOL....darnit
superretroworld: nickelodeon
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: STOP MAKING ME WANT TO PLAY A GAME I DISLIKE!
08,01i'd watch The Appljack Show
04Oh yeah, you're right Shizuka. Bleh, it's Flanderized that I'm thinking of
Expy is a character who acts and talk almost exactly like one from another show or like a real celebrity
13that's what it was
/me hugs SuperBrony64|McD. You went out of your way just for little old Pinkie-crazy me? Aww. you shouldn't have.:$
08,01actually, i think RD and PP would make the best co-hosts
Shamroc if you want to play it, then you don't dislike it
so much TVTropes...
04But yeah, Big Mac is kinda Flanderized already
just harvest a bunch of iron, make some armor, and then make a bunch of swords
you'll be set
did you know the reddit alien has a name
13http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/seth2n_5924.png basically that
04But thankfully Studio B isn't that bad about it
or even better
its snoo
Time is... 12:57 am. 7 hours and 7 minutes 2 go.
03well
set it to normal
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: but i dislike the whole entire concept of it....
sit in your house all nifght
/me hugs back Pinkies4thWall "Of course I would, you're mah friend :3"
08,01Ghosties: but that got totally inverted in that episode about the stuff!
at daybreak, skelies will burn and die
03I wanna use the iron to build a minecart
04It did
leaving their stuff
03ah
03I could put it on hard then
03my house is made of obsidian
nah
08,01which episode was that?
04Instead AJ did the "eeeenope" and Big Mac said stuff
.....mods having chat that im to stupid to understand...
Shizuka: I can't see it for some reason
03I don't think even creepers can attack it
Shamroc since you WANT to play it, NO you don't :p
you don't need that much
cachi01: never, mlp or derpy will never be on nickeloden, it would ruin everything
SuperBrony64|McD: is there any online support for rythym heaven fever?
they'll blow up the glass
04It was the uh
SuperBrony64|McD is everyones friend :D
but thats about it
04Frick
03oh, the glass isn't invincible? XD
04That CMC ep
nope
04Oh...what was it called...
....
it'd be cool to have a co-op
why would it lOL
Hearts and Hooves day
13http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy danger will robinson
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: SHH
cachi01: nickelodeon doesnt even show cartoons anymore
Ponyville confidential.
04No, not Hearts and Hooves
Ghosties: ponyville confidentail
04PONYVILLE CONFIDENTIAL, THAT'S IT
Firaga_Rain: here in mexico they do
08,01ah yeah
Firaga_Rain: well kinda
Huh, coulda sworn
chachi01: but but i live there
Ghosties: dat AHA moment
04And AJ did the eeeeenope while Big Mac was like "You three should be ashamed"
lol dat role reversal
That part was epic.
03because it's attached to obsidian?dunno
04I know, I laughed
dat role reversal was like HORY SHEET
Big Mac has a sexy voice, idc what anybody says
lol
nah
it'll break
Firaga_Rain: now boomerang.... boomerang become a channel for sluts
cachi01: everytime i see whats on, its mostly icarly or other stupid crap
but yeah, just set it to normal
04I just hope Big Mac doesn't become Flanderized, that would suck so much
hard wont make any difference
are big mac and cheerlie atill dating?
04He's one of the best characters on the show :o
What does that Flanderized mean?
whats Flanderized
still*
Wait...what are we talking about? O.o
Ghosties: He was in hearts and hooves day
03OK
Im lost
*in spawn rate
03well first I need to set up some chests
RaveBrony: tv
03and guard them with obsidian
03:D
04Flanderized, when a specific quirk or trait of a character becomes that character's defining attribute
RaveBrony: just random stoof lol hello btwe
nah
Aaaah.
chests are pretty much safe in your version
cachi01: i know right? with all those soap operas from argentina...
04So like Big Mac's "eeeeeyup"
Oh and hi MahBoi777! :)
Ninjazz: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization
besides, if you keep them inside, and close your door, nothing will happen
Hi RaveBrony how you be do?
04That would become a running gag, which would then eventually replace his entire character
03>inside
03they're just sitting out in the open
uh
Thanks, Spectrum_Rush.
03my house is tiny
Ghosties: what happened before?
03just two beds
03no extra roo
03m
TheHoodyNinja: I be, good? :D
04A broader example would be Family Guy
03so I'm gonna make a little obsidian fort
Firaga_Rain: every freaking time i change the chnnel its just fucking pretty little sluts
thats why you build a basement
03I have like 80 of them
Ninjazz: np
Ghosties: just link the tvtropes article man
03...
04Or even Simpsons, where the trope is derived
03LOL
03well
03I';m lazy
03and uncreative
03XD
....wat
04Someone already did, Firaga
so you spend all your time harvesting obsidian
simpsons the died in the 19 season
I think I like Octavia everyone.
ScootaChicken: take care man!
Good morning
03well
03I make it
08,01mfw Decker and Ilia were expy'd to Riker and Troi. EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE NOW
03>obsidian generator
mornin Bonsi
03all you need is redstone
Ghosties: so, an example might be he says eeyup more than once every ep?
Oh no, TaviChaser went off the deep end
I know
03but yeah LL and I found a giant lava pool and covered it in water
03it was fun
04Or that he only says it when he comes on screen
>harvesting
08,01please someone know what i'm talking about...
04It would be the only thing he does or say
oh ok
/me 08,01needs validation
whatever though
Firaga_Rain: i havnt notice the voice change O_o
hmm
when you start dealing with enemies
cachi01: :O
you really dont want to go out between forts in the middle of the night
04Basically the characters stop seeming like real people and become more...character-y
big mac always talk, its just eeyup is his famous line
thats why people try to connect everything
underground passages might work
Red and Yellow make me think of violence, for some reason
cachi01: they did like.....8 seasons ago
so the opposite of him being flanderized would be him getting even more dialogue?
Firaga_Rain: DAFUQ
08,01WallDives: well, yes
03hm
03I could try that
*vocabulary
04Like how Brian in Family Guy stopped being the logical person in the family and became an outright liberal nut
08,01but do you know which ones?
03I mean
Not to be "that guy" but is something going on with the stream?
family guys overrated
03I could prolly destroy my house and rebuild it :/
03but right now my wolf is nice and tame in there
03don't wanna screw it up
Ghosties: thats also called, becoming the creator's pet
Family guy used to be good
TaviChaser: Octavia is gonna be my wallpaper on my new comp
the new episodes.....suck
you don't have to destroy it lol...
04True
Ninjazz: That Guy
then it hit season 9
hmm... no stream... that makes my choice easier, back to lurking...
Spectrum_Rush: :|
04But I'll tell you one thing I liked
Sylandest: Already done that! :D
04That Stewie stopped being so damn boring
Ninjazz: i kid i kid
http://www.thesaddleryshop.co.uk/Upload/Images/6c514f86-e81e-49b5-8b48-0a8c81023c4a.jpg CLOP!
I used to like Brian.
04I can honestly say that I disliked Stewie originally
Guys, I love Octavia :|
otakon: hah
03How else do I build below it?
03it's all sand under there
Stewie eez not evil no moar
Ghosties: but stewie is now just gay and really annoying
04His evil genius shtick was just boring and trite
Hiya otakon!! And...wtf is that link? :D
Seasons 3-7 made the show
dig the and out
RaveBrony: just click it'
TaviChaser: When did this happen?
/me keeps his mouth shut about Family Guy
sand
04I love his "show about nothing" persona now
TaviChaser: I did too, but then my previous comp died. :( lost all my stuff including all my pony things
otakon: I did, and lol'd :D
*SNARL* Huh what I fell asleep
TaviChaser....so much for the i wont be obbessive thing lol..
oh no you dont Midnight_Tempest
Ninjazz: Today

TaviChaser: O U. :D

Kinda share the same thoughts with you on there, Midnight_Tempest.
TaviChaser: True, hehe. But first thing is first: obtain new comp after the geek squad of best buy finishes setting it up tomorrow
TheHoodyNinja: how about, no. I'm sticking with Tavi :3

08,01seriously, it's hilarious
Can you link it? :P
^
Oh hey Spell-of-Gaming :o
/me falls out of the chat
i know an indian book that started with K and ended with A
08,01start here: http://www.mahabharataonline.com/
Oh, I forgot to say hi. ^^'
08,01cachi01: Kama Sutra?
There's a turret because fuck you
08,01anyhoos, yeah
08,01most indian mythology is crazy, in the best way
is it a aperature science pinkie pie powered twilight sparkle turret eman?
That fact wasn't fun at all.
Monkeys EVERYWHERE!
08,01there's this one story where these pilgrims are on a religious journey, and the end up worshipping women's boobs
08,01i shit you not

08,01hinduism is hilarious
So emangamer, how long are you going to be playing? Twist is waiting for you to come to bed.
0,5PFFt
Oh god, Reading a fan-fic, I just read the MOST HORRIBLE LINE EVER.
*quite
08,01TheHoodyNinja: these are the stories my mother told me when i was young
0,5It started in low... THEN IT STARTED TO GROW
08,01which maybe explains a lot
moo
Don't the hindus believe that the world is the dream of their deity or something?
O_O
it started in your ass ad
No moos!
A.D.
08,01Kandarihu: i... hmm, maybe somethign like that
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337395454563.jpg
Likely because Greece got fucked up by the romans.
08,01but it's full of sex and violence, hinduism is
i found out my friend uses 9gag
Brahman.
i smashed his computer
:D
and the Romans took their religion. and then THEY got buttfucked by the visigoths.
lol 9gag
Well, greek mythology is more epic than wierd. The story of Portal 2 was based on Greek mythology as I read on Gamefaqs
man i dont know how 9gag got so popular here in mexico
i found a snoo toy at walmart
here's comes a question for the community
08,01Kandarihu: this is true
YES YES MOOS
Firaga_Rain: IKR
i threw one made out of medal at him
08,01about it being more epic, and the Portal 2
Can we make fun of 9gag for using le so much at Rage comics? :P
Doesn't hinduism literally have a god of sex and violence?
What do you guys think of 9gag, Reddit and memebase?
lololol
its about PONIES!!
(custom made snoo of course)
08,01Greek mythology is basically like reading Tolkien
its like a shitty Reddit: and thats saying something
08,01Hindu mythology is basically like reading Chaucer
CrimsonPhoenix: i dont care about reddit but 9gag and memebase are awesome
Crimsom, 9gag's community bites, memebase is... alright.
the thing is today is my cake day
i love greek mythology, its what made english so interesting
08,01RAWRity: aye, yes
My class uses 9gag :I
or Atheist
08,01RAWRity: duuude, have you read any Cicero?
wat?
cachi01: 9gag...awesome....dafuq?
Apparently, they don't like Memebase
08,01Cicero is just amazing
08,01he's so funny
seriously henduism is so diverse you cant really just "study hinduism"
i was in class and my teacher set her iphone on the table and it was on 9gag
08,01he basically insults everyone to make his point
08,01in the most hilarious ways
Alright. Back to another point of no return.
Funnyjunk's where it's at. They got the community aspect down to a t.
oh god
so i screamed what is this shit and switched it to reddit
08,01RAWRity: aye, that
OH GOD
Firaga_Rain: yes its awesome 9gag.com/gag/4168962 luke skyracist
im going to bed, night everyone
night superretroworld
Goodnight, Super.
night superretroworld
08,01so basically, if you take nothing else away from what i've said to today, remember this at least: read some Hindu mythology, and read some Cicero

So who's worse: Ozai or Amon?
Ninjazz: hehe yes!
panda: no bending?
its a flash of a flashback
DeathStar|sick: XD oh my gosh,
00,10notice he's been playing bad guys alot lately
^
"LET DIS BEE LESON FOR YOU"
Sumica: hasnt he always? well except like 2?
and his voice is so sinister :D
oh lol He plays Zoltun Kulle in D3 xDDD
i knew fluttershy was an anti-bender!!!
New Sokka?
00,10spike spegal and roger smith
Lol perfectly timed Flutter yay...
NOM!
Shamroc But Amon is disrupting nature and biology itself.
panda: Well, considering that he is in almost EVERYTHING, I'm sure that he has done some good parts.
Sumica: yea like i said, two
TheHoodyNinja: you know, i just realized theyre quite similar to the old trio
He was also in Bulletstorm as the main Protag.
curse you technology!
00,10yeah I was nameing them
"I love the Chi glove, its so bad"
Ninjazz: well... you'd have to show me
just a smidge communist
Although, this guy makes a good point
panda: I'm sure Imdb would help you out better than I would. ;)
Shamroc Point taken.
00,10but he is a bender
Ninjazz: hehe probably :D
WOO!
GOOD MUSIC IS BEST MUSIC
BOOM
well, i guess you could say, they went it out with a bang
jjust a little explosion
Now... Time the most awesome part yet.
woosh
anyone remember that move from the first show?
failures,,
Spiderbender!
i wonder when Korra will learn to go into avatar state
like a baws
they ded
ded
00,10she still struggles with the spirt side of bending
like a BAUWS
damn that guys a badass
She doesn't have enough control.
dats gotta hurt
ow
I already know how the season is going to end.
sumica: yeah thats why air bending has been a bitch to her
She's a loose cannon, you could so.
say*
Sumica: are you going to stream the season finale when it premieres?
firebending=SOMEONES ANGRY
00,10I plan on streaming all the eps
Aang spends 3 seasons until he learns fire bending
TheHoodyNinja: =/
Korra knows it at the start, and is working on air
Korra knew it at age 5
and the old lady's screwed
00,10well firebending is all she can realy usee where she is at right now
13three seasons later she'll get it
Think about this: Bending is something people use to live by and technology is built around it, yes?
Metalbending = someone's a BAUS
00,10no earth or water up on the roof
Shizuka: sadly only 2
she can water bend lol
she's spiderman
00,10and she is still learning air
apparently i read that Toph developed Metal bending
tough banner
Yes, she did Shane
damn katara for not teaching anyone how to blood bend
didnt a earthbender already do metalbending?
then again....
However, though it's called metalbending, they don't actually bend the metal
Blood Magic is illegal.
They bend the impurities within the metal
00,10oki new ep time
great, moar war
Ninjazz: I'd still use it :D
Darkts3: Shes Tophs daughter
I mean Blood Bending.
yay, war
blood is mostly water.
NEW EPISODE YAY
just sayin
WAR. WAR APPARENTLY CHANGES
Ninjazz: only Katarra knows it
panda: For what?... O_O
Buy war bonds today!
The clone wars have begun
Ninjazz: killing people of course :D
i belive this is where communism and democracy differ, communisim is forced equality, democracy is equality of right
What's the name of this show again?
Dat revised opening
WOO New one
otakon: She does? When did she learn it?
amon is communist
Legend of Korra
Ninjazz: near the end of the last series
panda: But couldn't Fire or Earth do the job just as well?
00,10I love when people ask for show name as it says it on stream
^
lol
otakon: Damn... I must have forgetten.
lol
Ninjazz: she learned it from a REALLY old women and she used it to kick everyones ass
Ninjazz: well... i like hidden stuff :D
Ninjazz: must have
hey otakon what movie is dis?
Ninjazz: she learns it from an old witch lady
What is that man's plan?
Shamroc: She actually used blood bending to kick ass?!
twilight_sprinkler: it's not a moive, show.
what a dick
Ninjazz: yeah, she used it once, but... she kinda hated herself for it
well Ninjazz outa anger...after that she never used it again
Ninjazz: Blood bending can only be done on a full moon.
panda: I know I would... That's kinda... extreme.
otakon i didnt ask if its a show, i asked what movie is dis?
shes the Avatar and abuses her power
00,10heart broken
Ninjazz: it was reeeeally creepy
lol
steal samurai??
twilight_sprinkler: it's not a movie, it's a show.
