When and how do you tell when it's "out of hand"? I mean, jeesus. The artists get content out faster than any other group I've ever seen. But it's still apparently not at /that/ point yet.
Oui.
...I'm all out.
Hai.
its addicting like i said...
Eh. I really hope I am wrong though.
goddammit
why is it that movies display runtime in minutes
hello everypony!

And the same thing goes for people already in the fandom.
best song youve prolly never heard of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj3mKYASycg
Hello everypony, i'm back!
i would and am still with it also with the kim possible fandom
There's a kim possible fandom?
FINNTROLL!!!
i was searching for kp wallpapers and i came acrossed the r34 imigase at age 15 i had a psp
use bing then.
R34 ruins the fandom? You've never been on /mlp/, I take it.
Not saying I don't see it.
I have no controll over it I realize, agian I am not trying to make it stop.
Its fine, its just bad.
Get it?
i agree. ^
To summarise my beliefs about most everything, if you don't stick it down the throats of others, I really couldn't care less.
Tolerance of everything but intolerance.
O_o
alright animations are done
now to write the code
"Just don't hurt anyone" is mine. Rather broad statement.

I mean why do you think there is a rule here against that sort of thing?
wow that was easy
Its not becuase it is just unwanted, but it would chase people off.

hi
the most confusing thing for me was when I was learning english types of school, because in czech we have: 1. basic school, 2. middle school, 3. high school (or university) and if I remember righ english have 1. basic school, 2. high school, 3. college (or university) is it right?
and english also have secondary school, but I dont know where it belongs
lol
Hi.
>
?
Not anymore.
y
Lost the virtual image.
u torrented it?
Yup.
how could u
Dosh.
its underrated
.kcirP
.knujremmaK lol
In English a Basic school would be considered an Elementary School
Ello :D
which is grades K to 6
Middle School for grades 7-8
Then High School 9-12
L.O.
Wait...
How're you?
yup
just downed some egg nog, doing good, how are ya?
I'm fine
neato
Do you have grade levels there?

HOWEVER
then again the character is pretty minor and has been killed very early
wait I forgot
Anime man
even Naruto was shocked
no, he was BEYOND Bishonen
he was a straight up trap
Zabuza was such a cool antagonist
shame he had to be the first
I liked his character arc
too farfetch'd

naruto sucks
Naruto was cool with the first series
naruto sucks
that was fun
/me lays down crying and falls asleep
and the tests they had were great too
basically it's like dragonball
nah
the first series was amzing
but then the second one came
aaaaaaaaaaaaaand yeah
I guess it was good for action
and the manga was good until pain died, now its going downhill as well
Ello
/me is sick :<
if that ever happen
I wouldn't even be surprised
id rather get into Evangelion shipping over naruto shipping
in joke right?
afterall, naruto has horrible fans
*the 2nd
yeah
accident
all fandoms have terrible fans
yeah that doesn't count
By the way guys
still, one thing naruto was always great was the tricks they used to defeat enemies, it was pretty clever and even used a bit of physics at times
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/70734/something-like-feeling pretty cool story
gives something to think about
well shite
just near EVERYTHIGN is inspired by DBZ

00,02never played battlefield
00,10I can fly a lib and gal ok but a reaver(esf) is a no go
00,02i could probably pilot a gal if only because its slower
00,02more time to compensate for silly controls
its just massive
00,02it is absurdly large
00,10I can make them do loops and shit
*just like this
00,10some bases controll upwards of 10 hexes
Aaah
00,02theres still a lot of bases
and could not accomplish
PS2?
00,02and each base may have several smaller bases around it that you can capture to spawn vehicles
00,02anyway, reboot time
00,10larger bases have upwards of 4 points to control as well as outlien depos that you dont have to own to capture but are helpfull
00,10such as span points and tank termnals
Like a secondary capture point basically?
05back with lunch
05a simble hamburger

It's very close to 21st in Aussiegrit
Universe works on EST
well the Calender ended in June
since Leap Years didn't exist then
08,01hoepfully15
actually
the world runs on UTC
The Multiverse runs on Unix time
08,01Serenity: but that doesn't make sense, because a day and a year are of fixed length
hi guys i am in the middle of a blizzerd right now
Saturn actually... they arnt
Saturn: This was before astrology was refound
HaI EVERYPONY
they add leap seconds which adjusts the length of a day
Like 1000 years ago
08,01chrysalis: astronomically speaking, i mean
yes i'm in MURICA!
i think the actual date was June 6th or something close to that
Yeah. Been watching that blizzard
Its crazy
again, we are slowing down
First day of winter is going to be crazy
we are still changing the length of a day
08,01though actually, there are two lengths of a day: a synodic day and a sidereal day
ded
Well that explains the bulges... in my pants.
Sunrise wasn't until quarter past 8 in England
08,01the former refers to the day wrt. the sun, and the latter to the day wrt. the stars
will*
And sundown was at 3
only room to fit one person though
08,01a synodic day is 1/365.25 less than a sidereal day
08,01iirc
For the leap year thing
Dangit, I totally meant to wait half a minute for that.
Why not just make seconds last a little longer?
Okay, NOW it's 15 minutes

The Mayan calendars does not predict the end of the world-- it suggests the end of a cycle. It suggests change. Not an apocalypse.
we're going 2 die.... but not tomorrow
